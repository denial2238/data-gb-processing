Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females, and the new global incidence is over 1.2million cases.The branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) is a rate-limiting enzyme in branched-chain amino acids catabolism, which plays an important role in many serious human diseases.
Here we investigated that abnormal branched-chain amino acids catabolism in colorectal cancer is a result of the dis- ease process, with no role in disease initiation; BCKDK is widely expressed in colorectal cancer patients, and thosepatients that express higher levels of BCKDK have shorter survival times than those with lower levels; BCKDK promotes cell transformation or colorectal cancer ex vivo orin vivo . Mechanistically, BCKDK promotes colorectal cancer by enhancing the MAPK signaling pathway through direct MEK phosphorylation, rather than by branched-chain amino acids catabolism.And the process above could be inhibited by a BCKDK inhibitor, phenyl butyrate.© 2017 The Authors.Published by Elsevier B.V.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).Keywords: Branched-chain amino acids catabolismColorectal cancerBCKDKTumorigenesisMEK Phenyl butyrate 1.
Introduction Tumor metabolism is closely related to tumorigenesis and tumor progression ( Burrage et al., 2014; Gill et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2013; Pike et al., 2011; Sonnet et al., 2016; Watanabe et al., 1984 ).Gill et al. (2016) presented that the increased rate of glycolysis can support cancer cells rapid proliferation through ful ﬁlling cells biosynthetic de- mands.Pike et al.(2011) showed fatty acid oxidation promotes cancer cells growth and survival through providing bioenergetic fuel for cells.Nelson et al.(2013) demonstrated a primary metabolite of cholesterol,27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), promotes tumor cells growth andmetastasis through signal transduction.The above studies show that the metabolism effects tumor growth in 3 ways: providing biosynthetic materials, providing energy, or through signal transduction.Branched- chain amino acids (BCAA) catabolism is abnormal in many human dis- eases ( Burrage et al., 2014; Sonnet et al., 2016; Watanabe et al., 1984 ).
Branched-chain amino transferase (BCAT) is the ﬁrst enzyme in BCAA catabolism which has a higher activity in tumors and has been shown to be a useful marker for grading and genetic characterization in glioma, colorectal cancer (CRC) and medulloblastoma ( Conway et al., 2016; de Bont et al., 2008; Mitchell et al., 2014 ). However, healthy human pros- tate tissue was found to have elevated BCAT levels relative to malignant tissue ( Billingsley et al., 2014 ).Therefore, the role of BCAA catabolism in tumors need to be further understood.BCKDK is a key negative regulation enzyme in BCAA catabolism that inhibits the dehydrogenase activity of the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex by dephosphorylating the E1 compo-nent of the complex ( Chuang et al., 2002 ).
BCKDK plays an important role in many serious human diseases, including Huntington's disease(Mochel et al., 2007 ), Maple syrup urine disease ( Beaudet, 2012;EBioMedicine 20 (2017) 50 –60 Abbreviations: BCAA, branched-chain amino acids; BCKDK, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase kinase; CRC, colorectal cancer; BCAT, branched- chain amino transferase; 27HC, 27-hydroxycholesterol; BCKA, branched- chain α-keto acid; BCKDHA, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase E1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PB, phenylbutyrate. ⁎Corresponding authors.E-mail addresses: yan070@sina.com (W.Yan), zhwang@fmmu.edu.cn (Z.Wang), zhengjy@fmmu.edu.cn (J.Zheng), fengzhu@hust.edu.cn (F.Zhu).1Peipei Xue, Fanfan Zeng and Qiuhong Duan contributed equally to this article and should be considered as co- ﬁrst authors.http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.05.0012352-3964/© 2017 The Authors.Published by Elsevier B.V.

Contents lists available at ScienceDirect EBioMedicine journal homepage: www.ebiomedicine.com Sonnet et al., 2016 ), human autism with Epilepsy ( Novarino et al., 2012 ), and Obesity ( Burrage et al., 2014 ).However, the relationship be- tween BCKDK and cancer is unknown.CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females, and the new global incidence is over 1.2 million cases (Torre et al., 2015 ).Therefore, the mechanism of CRC tumorigenesis need to be further elucidated.Watanabe et al.(1984) reported that BCAA levels in the tumor tissue of colon cancers were generally higherthan those in the respective nontumorous tissue.On the other hand, Wubetu et al.(2014) showed BCAA suppressed insulin-initiated prolif- eration of human Colon tumor cells through induction of autophagy.Yoshikawa et al.
(2006) demonstrated BCAT1 over-expression is a sen- sitive marker of metastasis in CRC. Therefore, the role of BCAA catabo-lism in CRC is controversial.BCAA is a biosynthetic material, however, whether BCAA is a potential carcinogen is unclear.In this study, we identify BCKDK as an upstream kinase of MEK.We show that the BCKDK positively regulates MEK/ERK signaling by direct- ly phosphorylating MEK at Ser221.BCKDK has a higher expression in the colorectal tissues of CRC patients versus normal tissues.The higher that BCKDK is expressed, the shorter survival time is in CRC patients.Over-expression of BCKDK increases the clone formation of JB6 Cl41 and WiDr cells ex vivo.Knockdown of BCKDK inhibits colorectal tumor progression ex vivo and in vivo .The above suggests BCAA catabolism can crosstalk with MAPK signaling pathway, whereby BCKDK plays a crucial role in human CRC tumorigenesis through phosphorylating MEK at ser221.2.Materials and Methods 2.1.

Cell Culture The human colon cancer cell lines (DLD1, HCT8, SW480, WiDr, HCT116, and HCT15) and the normal cell lines (HIEC-6, JB6 C141, and HEK293T) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). 2.3.Western Blot Cells (0.8 –2×1 0 6) were cultured in 10 cm diameter dishes to 70 –80% conﬂuence, and then starved no serum for either 12 h (JB6 C141 cell lines) or 24 h (colon cancer cell lines).The cells were then treated with 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) (R&D catalog: 236-EG-200) for 15 min.EGF is a well-known tumor promotion agent used to study malignant cell transformation in animal and cell models of cancer (Hunter and Karin, 1992; Sachsenmaier et al., 1994; Sassone-Corsi et al., 1999; Sca ﬁdi et al., 2014 ).After this, cells were washed once in PBS before being lysed in RIPA buffer (1 × PBS, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L aprotinin and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride).
In addition, HCT116 cells were treated with 0 –3200 μM BCKDK inhibitor for 48 h, with the later 24 h together with no serum. Then, samples were sonicated in 15 second intervals three times, and insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 15 min.Protein content was determined by Bradford method ( Bradford, 1976 ).30 –120μg of protein was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by chemiluminescence (BIO-RAD, USA) intriplicate.2.4.Growth Curve Analysis and MTS Assays 2×1 0 5cells were plated in each dish and counted at different times in triplicate, using a hemacytometer to generate a growth curve.For inhibition assays, 1 × 103HCT116 cells were seeded in 96-well plates for 24 h, and then cells were fed with fresh medium containing differentconcentrations of BCKDK inhibitor, phenyl butyrate (PB), for 48 h.
The cytotoxicity of inhibitors was measured with MTS assay kit (Promega catalog: G3580) according to the manufacturer's instructions in tripli- cate, with the results expressed as the percentage of inhibition. 2.5.Bacterial Expression and Puri ﬁcation of the MEK1-His The pET23a-mek1 (residues 62-393)-his plasmid was expressed in E.coli BL21 bacteria (Novagen; Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany).Bacteria were grown at 37 °C overnight.Then, bacteria were harvested by51 P.Xue et al./ EBioMedicine 20 (2017) 50 –60 centrifugation at 3000 rpm.The pellets were washed with PBS 5 times, and were disrupted by sonication.The lysate was again centrifuged, and the new pellets were washed by PBS for another 5 times.The clean pel- lets were then dissolved with a minimum volume of 8 M Urea buffer (8 M Urea, 50 mM Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5%Triton-100, pH 8.0).The protein in supernatant was saved, and diluted to 1 M Urea buffer for use.2.6.
Immunoprecipitation and IP Kinase Assay HEK293T cells were transfected with different plasmids for 48 h and HCT116 were seeded in 10 cm dishes for 24 h. Then, cells were harvest- ed in IP buffer (50 mM tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, and 1 mM DTT).2 mg proteins were subjected to immunoprecip- itation following the manufacturer's instructions.(Http:// www.scbt.com/protocols.ht ml?protocol = immunoprecipitation).The mouse source antibody was used for IP and the rabbit source antibody was used for western blotting.The BCKDK-Flag kinase was prepared with same method of Immu- noprecipitation except BCKDK-Flag was diluted in 1× kinase buffer (Bil- lerica, MA, USA) instead of 2× loading buffer (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).Likewise, MEK1 (residues 62-393)-his was prepared as above.2 mg MEK1 (residues 62-393)-his was use for IP Kinase.The kinase and sub- strate were incubated at 37 °C for 70 min in 1× kinase buffer containing 100μmol/L unlabeled ATP.
If a kinase inhibitor was used, the kinase was ﬁrst incubated with the inhibitor (0 –3200 μM) at 32 °C for 20 min in 1× kinase buffer. The appropriate substrates were then added to the reac- tions and incubated at 37 °C for another 70 min.Samples were treated with 5× loading buffer and analyzed by western blotting.2.7.Anchorage-independent Cell Transformation Assay Different cell lines (8 × 103/well) were seeded in 6-well plates, and exposed or not exposed to EGF (20 ng/mL), BCAA (180 –5670 μM) or in- hibitor (0 –3200 μM).The cells were then cultured in 1 mL of 0.33% BME (Eagle basal medium, Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) Agar (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 25 μg/mL gentamicin, with an additional 3 mL of 0.5% BME agar containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 25 μg/mL gentamicin being below.Then the cells were maintained in a 37 °C, 5% CO 2incubator for 4 –7 days and the colonies were observed and assessed by microscopy.2.8.
Tumor Xenografts and Immunohistochemistry Male athymic Balb/c nude mice (4 –6-week-old) were purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience Co, Ltd. (Beijing, China).The mice were housed and maintained with the guide for care and use of lab- oratory animals which were approved by the Fourth Military Medical University.Mice were divided and randomized into two groups.Each of the different cell lines (3 × 106in 200 μl PBS) was injected subcu- taneously into the right ﬂank.The tumor volumes were measured every other day and were calculated with the formula: V = 0.52 (length × width × height).The tumor tissues were prepared with paraf ﬁn sections after ﬁxation with formalin, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or p- MEK1/2(ser221) (1:50) and p- ERK1/2 (Tyr202/Tyr204) (1:50).2.9.BCAA Assay and Tissue Microarray The serums were obtained from the department of State Key Labora- tory of Cancer Biology, Xijing hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University.
The tissues used for BCAA assay and tissue microarray (TMA) underwent CRC were obtained from the department of Urology, Xijing hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University. This study was approved by the ethical committee of the Fourth Military Medical University.Samples were obtained with informed consent.The BCAAassay was following the manufacturer's instructions ( http:// www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/pro- duct/sigma/mak003?lang= en&region=GB).The TMA was stained with anti-BCKDHA, anti- BCKDK or anti-p-BCKDK antibody.The immuno-scores were calcu- lated following the Remmele score method ( Regitnig et al., 2002 ), and the scores N3 were used as positive group, the others were used as negative group.2.10.Statistical Analysis All quantitative data in the present study were performed at least in triplicate.The results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.
A two-tailed ANOVA or Student's t-test was used to evaluate the data, and pb0.05 was considered signi ﬁcant (*p b0.05, ** p b0.01, ***p b0.001). 3.Results 3.1.BCAA Cannot Promote CRC Tumorigenesis BCAA is catabolized to R-CoA in normal cells.This process can be lim- ited when BCKDH is phosphorylated by BCKDK at the Ser293 (Fig.S1a) (Chuang et al., 2002 ).The concentration of BCAA is higher in tumor tis- sues compared with normal tissues ( Nezami Ranjbar et al., 2015 ).Me- tabolites can promote cell transformation directly ( L i ue ta l .,2 0 1 5 ; Nelson et al., 2013 ).Although the level of BCAA is higher in tumor, its role on cell transformation remains unrevealed.The JB6 C141 cell line represented a unique model for studying neoplastic transformation (Bernstein and Colburn, 1989 ); and therefore BCAA was added to JB6 C141 cells to assess its effect on anchorage-independent cell transfor-mation.
The result indicated that BCAA could not promote cell transfor- mation, even at very high concentration (16 times higher than serum concentration, Fig. S1b) ( Areces et al., 2015; Kooman et al., 1997; Szpetnar et al., 2014 ).Next, we detected the concentration of BCAA in the serums from 31 normal people and CRC patients or in the tissues from 10 CRC patients paired tumor and corresponding tumor adjacent tissues.The result showed that the concentration of BCAA had no signif- icant change in CRC patient serums or tissues compared with normal people serums (p = 0.837) or adjacent tissues (p = 0.661) (Fig.S1c).Therefore, BCAA could not promote CRC tumorigenesis.It has been widely reported that BCAA catabolism is abnormal in cancer patients; especially BCAT1 plays an important role in glioma ( Tönjes et al., 2013 ).However, there are two more key limiting enzymes, BCKDH and BCKDK in BCAA catabolism, and whether they are related to cancer, like BCAT1, has never been reported.
Therefore, we decided to explore the role of BCKDH and BCKDK in CRC. 3.2.BCKDK Over-expression is Associated With Poor Prognosis in CRC Patients Next, the expression levels of BCKDHA and BCKDK were analyzed in CRC tissue and corresponding tumor adjacent tissue samples.The re-sults indicated that expression level of BCKDHA was higher in CRC tissue than that of corresponding tumor adjacent tissue samples from 117 can- cer patients ( Fig.1 a upper and middle panel), although, it had no effect o n survival time (p = 0.112, Fig.1 a lower panel).The expression level of BCKDK was also higher in cancer tissue than adjacent tissue ( Fig.1 b upper and middle panel), and it had a signi ﬁcant effect on survival time (p = 0.011, Fig.1 b lower panel).BCKDHA is the substrate of BCKDK, so next the expression levels of p-BCKDHA were assessed inthe same way.While p-BCKDHA, was higher in cancer tissue than adja- cent tissue ( Fig.
1 c upper and middle panel), it had no signi ﬁcant effect on survival time (p = 0.368, Fig. 1 c lower panel).The above data sug- gest that BCKDK may be more important than BCKDHA in CRC patients.The higher level of BCKDK can result in higher level of BCAA; however, BCAA has no effect on cell transformation (Fig.S1b).Since BCAA catabolism is abnormal in cancer patients, BCKDK is one of the three52 P.Xue et al./ EBioMedicine 20 (2017) 50 –60 Fig.1.BCKDK overexpression is associated with poor prog nosis in CRC patients.(a) Immunohistochemical e xamination for the expression of BCKDHA in 117 cas es of human colon cancer tissues and matching adjacent tissues.Pictures from 1 representative case are shown in the upper panel , and the 2 scale bars from left to right in each group correspond to 50 and 25 μm respectively.The table summarizes the results of the immunohistochemical examination ( middle panel ).

The table summarizes the results of the immunohistochemical examination ( middle panel ).The median survival time is not different between p-BCKDHA-positive CRC patients and p-BCKDHA-negative CRC patients ( lower panel ).The survival time table was analyzed viathe Kaplan-Meier method.53 P.Xue et al./ EBioMedicine 20 (2017) 50 –60 key molecules in BCAA catabolism (Fig.S1a), and there is no report about the role of BCKDK in cell transformation, we therefore further ex- plored the possible role of BCKDK in CRC, described below.3.3.BCKDK Promotes Tumorigenesis First, BCKDK expression level was analyzed in 6 CRC cell lines and 1 normal intestinal epithelial cell line ( Fig.2 a).
The results showed that BCKDK was highly expressed in DLD1 and HCT116 cells, moderately expressed in HCT8 and HCT15 cells, and poorly expressed in SW480 and WiDr cells. The BCKDK level of normal HIEC-6 cells was the lowest.This result was consistent with that in CRC tissues from patients.To test whether BCKDK can promote cell transformation, BCKDK was next overexpressed in JB6 Cl41 cells or WiDr cells which poorly expressed BCKDK.JB6 Cl41 or WiDr stable cell lines that overexpressed the pCMV- c-Flag or pCMV-BCKDK-Flag were generated and the growth curves of JB6-Mock and JB6-BCKDK cells, or WiDr-Mock and WiDr-BCKDK cells were compared.The results showed that JB6-BCKDK cells grew faster than JB6-Mock cells ( Fig.2 b upper left panel, inner session of left panel in- dicating BCKDK overexpression).
Next, the anchorage-independentgrowth of JB6-Mock or JB6-BCKDK was compared, and the result indicated that the number of colonies in JB6-BCKDK cell cultures was much morethan that in JB6-Mock cell cultures ( Fig. 2 b upper right panel).The corre- sponding statistical signi ﬁcance is shown in the right panel of Fig.2 b.Sim- ilar results were observed in the cultures of WiDr-Mock or WiDr-BCKDK stable cells ( Fig.2 b lower panel).These results indicate that BCKDK pro- motes cell transformation.To verify this idea further, BCKDK was knocked down in HCT116 or DLD1 CRC cells to generate two stable shBCKDK cell lines and two stable shMock cell lines (HCT116-shBCKDK, HCT116- shMock or DLD1-shBCKDK, DLD1-shMock).As shown in Fig.2 c inner session of left panel by the result of Western blot, BCKDK was knockeddown by shRNA sequence for lines 4 and 5.
Next, growth curves of HCT116-shMock, -shBCKDK4, or -sh BCKDK5 cells were tested, and the re- sults demonstrated that HCT116-shBCKDK cells grew dramatically slowerthan HCT116-shMock cells (p b0.05, Fig. 2 c upper left panel).Next, the anchorage-independent growth of the HCT116-shMock or HCT116-shBCKDK cell lines was evaluated, and the results indicated that the number of colonies in HCT116-shBCKDK cell cultures was much less than in HCT116-shMock cell cultures ( Fig.2 c upper right panel).Similar results were observed in the DLD1 -shMock or DLD1-shBCKDK cell lines (Fig.2 c lower panels).Therefore, these results indicated that knockdown of BCKDK in colorectal tumor cells inhibited tumorigenesis ex vivo .N e x t , tumor xenograft assays were performed in male athymic Balb/c nude mice.We injected HCT116-shMock or HCT116-shBCKDK4 cells (3 ×1 0 6) subcutaneously into the right ﬂank, with tumor size assessed over time.
Tumors in HCT116-shMock-inoculated mice grew to a muchlarger size compared to those in HCT116-shBCKDK-inoculated mice (Fig. 2 d left panel).The tumor growth curve is shown in the right panel ofFig.2 d.These data demonstrated that blocking BCKDK expression in CRC cells signi ﬁcantly reduces their tumorigenic properties ex vivo and in vivo ,a n df u r t h e rc o n ﬁrmed that BCKDK promotes cell transformation.3.4.BCKDK Promotes Tumorigenesis Through Up-regulating the MEK-ERK Signaling Pathway We con ﬁrmed that BCKDK promoted cell transformation ex vivo and in vivo .Next, we wanted to know which signaling pathway was in- volved in this process.The MAPK signaling pathway has been widely re- ported to link with carcinogenesis, with MEK and ERK being two critical kinases in this pathway ( Rauch et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2007 ).
Therefore, p-MEK1/2 (ser221) and p-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204) levels were tested in JB6Cl41 and WiDr BCKDK stable cell lines, and the results indicated that the level of p-MEK and p-ERK were up-regulated when BCKDK was overexpressed ( Fig. 3 a).These results suggest that BCKDK promotes CRC through up-regulating MEK-ERK activity.Next, the level of p-MEKand p-ERK were tested in the HCT116 or DLD1 shBCKDK cell lines.Both p-MEK and p-ERK were decreased signi ﬁcantly when BCKDK was knocked down in each of these cell lines ( Fig.3 b).Next, the expression level of p-MEK1/2 (Ser221), p-ERK1/2(T202/Y204), and BCKDK were detected in tumor tissues dissected from the xenografts in the study by Western blotting or immunohistochemical analysis.The results con- ﬁrmed that the level of p-MEK1/2 (Ser221), p-ERK1/2(T202/Y204), and BCKDK were higher in the tumor tissue of HCT116-shMock mice than in the tumor tissue of HCT116-shBCKDK mice ( Fig.3 c).
And the dissected tissues were also stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) to con ﬁrm these tissues belong to tumor tissues ( Fig. 3 c right lower panel).These data con ﬁrmed that BCKDK promoted colorectal tumorigenesis through up-regulating the MEK-ERK signaling pathway.3.5.BCKDK Directly Phosphorylates MEK1 at ser221 We elucidated that the levels of p-MEK1/2 (ser221) and p-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204) could be controlled by B CKDK, which implied that BCKDK might interact with MEK and phosphorylate it at Ser221 directly.First, whether BCKDK can interact with MEK was tested by co-immunoprecip- itation experiments utilizing HEK293T cells.MEK1 and MEK2 share 79% amino acid similarity and are able to phosphorylate ERK substrates with equivalent capacity ( Scholl et al., 2005 ).However, MEK1 plays a more im- portant role in the growth and development of mice ( Bélanger et al., 2003; Giroux et al., 1999 ).
So pCMV-BCKDK-Flag or pCMV-Myc-MEK1 construct was transfected or co-transfected into HEK293T cells, then immunoprecipitated the tagged proteins with the Flag or Myc antibody, and then probed with anti-Flag or anti-Myc, respectively, in Western Blot assays. The results demonstra ted that BCKDK could co-immunopre- cipitate with MEK1 ( Fig.4 a).However, since the detected interaction was performed in an overexpression system, we next assessed whether endogenous BCKDK was immunoprec ipitated from HCT116 cells, as de- tected by Western blotting with a MEK antibody.The results indicatedthat BCKDK could co-immunoprecipitates with MEK1 in HCT116 cells (Fig.4 b).BCKDK is a protein kinase, so we next determined if it can phos- phorylate MEK directly.An in vitro kinase assay was set up to test this idea.For this, we ﬁrst obtained BCKDK by immunoprecipitation form overexpressing HEK293T cells and used it as the kinase.Inactive MEK1(residues 62-393) was used as the substrate.
The kinase assay was per- formed in the presence of cold ATP, with p-MEK1/2(Ser221) subsequent- ly detected by Western blotting. The results indicated that BCKDK could phosphorylate MEK1 at Ser221 directly ( Fig.4 c).Next, BCKDK was overexpressed in HEK293T cells, the cells were stimulated with EGF,and the endogenous phosphorylation of MEK was subsequently analyzed.These data indicated that increasing the amount of BCKDK leads to in- creased phosphorylation of endogenous MEK1/2 ( Fig.4 d), further sug- gesting that BCKDK can phosphorylate MEK1/2 at Ser221 directly.3.6.BCKDK Inhibitor Reduces Tumorigenic Properties As shown above, BCKDK can promote tumorigenesis in CRC.There- fore, compounds may reduce tumorigenic properties if they can inhibit BCKDK.PB is an inhibitor of BCKDK which has been used to modulate BCAA catabolism ( Tso et al., 2013).However, whether PB can block CRC is not known.
Here, we used this inhibitor to further con ﬁrm the hypoth- esis that BCKDK promotes colorectal tumorigenesis viaphosphorylating MEK1 at Ser221 and then activating the MEK-ERK signal pathway. First,MTS assays were performed to assess an y potential cytotoxicity of this in- hibitor in HCT116 cells that expressed a high level BCKDK.The results in-dicated that PB had no cytotoxicity in HCT116 cells at 48 h, even at a very high (3200 μM) concentration ( Fig.5 a).Second, PB was used directly in in vitro kinase assays to test if it can inhibit p-MEK1 by reducing BCKDK ac- tivity.The results indicated that PB can inhibit the phosphorylation level of MEK1 at Ser221 in a dose dependent manner ( Fig.5 b).Third, the ex- pression of p-MEK1/2 (ser221), p-E RK1/2 (T202/Y204), and p-BCKDHA (Ser393) were detected in the HCT116 cells treated with different con- centrations of PB.The results demonstrated that PB inhibited the level54 P.Xue et al./ EBioMedicine 20 (2017) 50 –60 Fig.2.

Last, soft agar assays were used to test if PB could block anchorage-independent growth of HCT116 cells. The data indicated that PB inhibited anchorage-independent growth of HCT116 cells from the concentration of 800 μM, and corresponding statistical signi ﬁcance was showed in the lower right panel ( Fig.5 d).Taken together, our study indicates that BCKDK promotes colorectal tumorigenesis through up-regulation of the MAPK signaling pathwayby phosphorylating MEK at Ser221.4.Discussion CRC is the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths, with 600,000 deaths is reported in the world annually ( Torre et al., 2015 ).Signi ﬁcantprogress has been achieved in understanding the molecular pathways involved in the carcinogenesis of CRC during the past three decades, which brings great bene ﬁts to CRC patients by targeted drugs ( He et al., 2016; Kuo et al., 2016; Manchado et al., 2016; van der Velden etal., 2016 ).
As the effectiveness of those targeted drugs is limited by in- trinsic drug resistance ( Tong et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016 ), there are some patients who are remaining “undruggable ”. About 40% of CRC pa- tients with wild type EGFR, KRAS, or BRAF are still resistant to anti-EGFRtreatment ( Bardelli and Siena, 2010; De Roock et al., 2010; Douillard et al., 2013 ).MEK has unique characteristics among the components of the MAPK pathways and has been considered as an ideal therapeutic target, because it can integrate many mitogenic signals into the ERKs, its only substrates.The expression level of MEK is higher in renal cell carcinoma resistant tissues than in renal cell carcinoma tissue when treated with Fig.3.BCKDK promotes tumorigenesis through up-regulating MEK-ERK signaling pathway.(a) The level of phosphorylation of MEKs and ERKs were increased in JB6/WiDr-BCKDK cells after EGF treatment for 15 min.
(b) The level of phosphorylation of MEKs and ERKs were decreased in HCT116/DLD1-shBCKDK cells after EGF treatment for 15 min. (c) The level of phosphorylation of MEKs and ERKs were decreased in the tumor tissues from HCT116-shBCKDK4-injected mice compared to HCT116-shMock-injected mice ( left panel ).Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed in the tumor tissues of HCT116-shMock-injected mice or HCT116-shBCKDK4-injected mice ( right panel ).All Western blot data are representatives of results from triplicate experiments.56 P.Xue et al./ EBioMedicine 20 (2017) 50 –60 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) ( Li et al., 2015; Qin et al., 2016), suggest- ing an alternative activation signaling pathway of MEK may exist besides the RAF-MEK pathway, and therefore contribute to drug resistance.MEK is a downstream key kinase of the EGFR signaling pathway and is a poten- tial therapeutical target (McCubrey et al., 2010 ).
In our research, BCKDK was demonstrated as an upstream kinase of MEK, phosphorylating MEKat serine 221 ( Fig. 4 ).Therefore, blocking the BCKDK-MEK signaling path- way might be a potential therapeutic strategy for CRC.PB is a well-known BCKDK inhibitor which can inhibit phosphoryla- tion of BCKDHA.It also acts as a histone deacetylase inhibitor ( Lea and Tulsyan, 1995 ) which had been shown to inhibit tumor growth in a wide variety of cancer cell lines, such as, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma,prostate cancer, and melanoma ( Huang et al., 2000; Kusaczuk et al., 2016; Carducci et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1994 ).Furthermore, Sung and Waxman (2007) demonstrated that Weekly infusions of PB combined with FUra were fairly well tolerated with disease stabilization in 3/4(75%) of colorectal cancer patients.However, Brinkmann et al.(2001) showed that hyperacetylated histones accumulation induced by histonedeacetylase inhibitors was not suf ﬁcient to cause growth inhibition in all cell types.
And the dose limiting neurocortical toxicity of confusionand excessive somnolence occurred in the patients of colorectal cancer, glioblastoma or prostate cancer who were treated with PB ( Sung andWaxman, 2007; Kusaczuk et al., 2016; Carducci et al., 2001 ). High con- centrations of PB are required to block BCKDK activity ex vivo (Brunetti-Pierri et al., 2011 )o rin vivo (Fig.5 b).Therefore, more ef ﬁcient inhibitors than PB for targeting BCKDK should be identi ﬁed to overcome drug resistance of CRC caused by consistent MEK activation.Many biomarkers have been used for CRC screening.Stool-Based Biomarker, Hemoglobin is widely used despite the low speci ﬁcity (80% –90%) and relatively low sensitivity (30% –50%) of this assay for the detection of advanced polyps and cancers ( Zhu et al., 2010 ).
Other types of fecal biomarkers, such as DNA biomarkers, have also been ex- tensively tested and approved for clinical use, including the chromo- somal instability pathway (CIN), the microsatellite instability (MSI) pathway, and the serrated polyp or CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) pathway. APC, EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, TP53, PIK3CA, ERBB2 detec- tion have likewise been used in CRC screening ( Dickinson et al., 2015 ).Our data shows that BCKDK is expressed at higher levels in colorectaltissues versus adjacent normal tissues, and patients who have higher BCKDK immuno-scores in their local focus tissues have a shorter surviv-al time ( Fig.1 b).This suggests that BCKDK can be another potential and valuable biomarker for the diagnosis of CRC.BCAA level increases when BCKDK is over-expressed ( Chuang et al., 2004; García-Cazorla et al., 2014; Nellis et al., 2003 ), but the role of Fig.4.BCKDK directly phosphorylates MEK1 at ser221.
(a) BCKDK binds with MEK in HEK 293 T cells after transient transfection as indicated. pCMV-Flag-BCKDK or pCMV-Myc-MEK1 construct was trasfected or co-transfected into HEK 293T cells, immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag or anti-Myc antibody, and then probed with Fla g or anti-Myc antibody, respectively.(b) BCKDK binds with MEK in HCT116 cells.Endogenous BCKDK was immunoprecipitated from HCT116 cells and then probed with anti-MEK antibody.(c) BCKDK phosphorylates MEK1 in vitro .The samples in A were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the mouse source Flag antibody, and then a kinase assay was performed with His- MEK1(residues 62-393) as substrate, and corresponding rabbit source antibodies were used in Western blot analyses.(d) BCKDK promotes phosphorylation of endogenous MEK inHEK 293 T cells in a dose-dependent manner after EGF treatment for 15 min.
Increasing amounts of Flag-BCKDK were transiently transfected into HEK 293 T cells, and the level ofphosphorylation of MEKs was detected by Western blot. All Western blot data are representatives of results from triplicate experiments.57 P.Xue et al./ EBioMedicine 20 (2017) 50 –60 BCAA in colorectal tumorigenesis or cancer growth has remained unde- termined, whether the concentration of BCAA in CRC patient serums or tumor tissues is also higher compared with the normal people serums or adjacent tissues is still unknown.First, our data indicated that BCAA could not promote cell transformation directly (Fig.S1b).Second, the concentration of BCAA has no signi ﬁcant change in CRC patient serums or tumor tissues compared with the normal people serums or adjacenttissues (Fig.S1c).BCAA in cancer (three essential amino acids) may be used for protein synthesis ( Chiarla et al., 1997 ).
In summary, BCAA could not promote CRC tumorigenesis, and these three essentialamino acids might provide raw materials for biosynthesis to maintain tumor cells' growth and survival ( Fig. 5 e).Taken together, our data revealed that BCKDK is highly expressed in CRC tissue, may be a valuable biomarker for CRC, and may promote transformation or oncogenesis by phosphorylating MEK directly at Ser221 ( Fig.5 e) rather than through BCAA catabolism.Crosstalkbetween BCKDK and MEK may therefore serve as therapeutic target toovercome drug resistance of CRC.Funding Sources This project was supported by the Nat ional Natural Science Foundation of China (nos.81672936, 81672739, & 81472602) and, the Independent Innovation Project of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (nos.2016YXZD034, 2014TS063, 2015QN151 & 2014ZZGH013), and the State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology Foundation (no.CBSKL2014Z18).Conﬂict of Interest The authors have no con ﬂict of interest.Fig.5.
