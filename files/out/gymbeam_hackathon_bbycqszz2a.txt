doi: 10.3389/fneur.2022.895978The Clinical Features and Long-Term Follow-Up of Vitamin B6-Responsive Infantile Spasms in a Chinese Cohort Xianru Jiao, Pan Gong, Yue Niu, Zhao Xu, Ye Wu, Yuehua Zhang and Zhixian Yang * Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospita l, Beijing, China Objective: To analyze the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of patients with vitamin B6-responsive infantile spasms (IS). Methods: The clinical features, genetics, and follow-up data of 30 pa tients were collected and analyzed.Results: Theageofepilepticspasms(ES)onsetwasfrom3monthsto12m onths.They allreceivedhighdosesofvitaminB6atdifferenttimesafte rtheonsetofES,rangingfrom 1 day to 5 months.ES were controlled within 11 days in 93% (28/ 30) patients, and as late as 1 month and 2 months in the other two patients.In the co urse of treatment, 28 patients were seizure-free all the time, and seizures of oth er two patients recurred due to withdrawal of vitamin B6.
The available follow-up EEG resul ts of 28 patients were normal in 26 cases, and 81% (21/26) had suppressed epileptic discha rges within 6 months. Of the 26 cases with normal follow up EEG, 4 had developmental delay and 22 had normal development.The time for EEG to return to normal in 22 patients with normal development ranged from 14 days to 2 years (mean =111.5 days; median =52.5 days).The time for EEG to return to normal in the other 4 patie nts with development delay ranged from 4 months to 2 years (mean =375 days; median =330 days).To the last follow-up, seizures were controlled well in 29 surv iving patients, and 21 patients wereabletodeactivatefromallmedicationswithoutseizur esrecurrence.Sixteenpatients showed varying degrees of developmental delay after onset.After seizure control, the psychomotor development was delayed in 7 patients (one died ) until the last follow-up.Genetic analysis did not show any meaningful results.
Conclusion: An observation period of 1–2 weeks is essential to identify p atients with vitamin B6-responsive IS. The treatment time could be e xtended according to the treatment response and EEG changes.It might take a longer ti me for EEG to return to normalandtostoptakingdrugsinpatientswithpersistento runimproveddevelopmental delay.Neurodevelopmental outcomes and prognosis of vitam in B6-responsive IS were relatively favorable.Keywords: vitamin B6, infantile spasms, West syndrome, epilept ic spasms, hypsarrythmia Jiao et al.Study of Vitamin B6-Responsive IS INTRODUCTION Infantile spasms (IS) classically present with a triad consis ting of epileptic spasms (ES), a characteristic electroencephalogr am (EEG) pattern known as hypsarrythmia or its variants, and neuro-regression ( 1).According to the report, partial patients diagnosed with IS responded to high-dose vitamin B6, and a series of similar cases have been reported ( 2–9).
Following the availability of genetic studies, vitamin B6-dependent epile psy, a heterogeneous group of disorders causing seizures that ca n be controlled or signiﬁcantly improved by high doses of vitamin B6, including pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE), pyridox(am)ine-5′-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) deﬁciency and PLPBPdeﬁciency, was formally diagnosed and treated ( 10– 13). However, partial patients with IS do not have the genetic mutation characteristic of vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy, an d they also dramatically respond to high-dose vitamin B6 thera py.IS controlled by vitamin B6 is termed as vitamin B6-responsiv e IS,andaccountsfor10–30%ofISpatients( 7,8).Despite the long period of time since vitamin B6-responsive IS was discovered, there have been limited reports so far.Her e, we describe the short- and long-term outcomes of 30 patients withvitaminB6-responsiveIS,and11ofthesepatientshavebe en previouslyreported( 14).
METHODS Ethics Statement This study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethical Committee of Peking University First Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from the legal guardians (parents)ofthepatients.Patients Thirty patients were diagnosed as vitamin B6-responsive IS in Peking University First Hospital between January 2012 and March 2021.
The following criteria were established: (1) During the course of the disease, ES occurred and was the main seizure type; (2) Ictal EEG monitored isolated or series of ES; (3) Demonstration of hypsarrhythmia or atypical hypsarrhythmia (“atypical” or “modiﬁed” hypsarrhythmia was consist of asymmetric features, focal discharges, and semi - periodic burst-suppression); (4) Seizures could be controlle d for at least 1 month while receiving vitamin B6 therapy alone or by the addition of vitamin B6 to previously ineﬀective antiseizu re medications (ASMs) therapy; (5) The genetic test for vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy was negative, including ALDH7A1 , PLPBP, andPNPO. For patients who could be managed and willing to cooperate, EEG monitoring was performed 1 week and 1 month after treatment to assess treatment response.Follow-up EEG was performed every 3–6 months until the result was normal.
Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), biochemical studies, plasma amino acids and urine organic acids test were performed in all patients. Neurodevelopmental assessment of these patients was evaluated through intellig ence tests (Wechsler or Gesell intelligence scales).The intell ectual disability (ID)/developmental delay (DD) severity was clas siﬁedaccording to intelligence quotient (IQ) scores as mild (IQ o f 55– 70),moderate(IQof40–54),severe(IQof25–39),orprofound ly severe(IQof <25).The Treatment of Vitamin B6 Since this study included a retrospective aspect, inconsistent treatments were covered.For patients who could be managed in our hospital, vitamin B6 was preferentially initiated in patie nts diagnosedasIS.Forpatientswhohavebeentreatedwithvitam in B6, but at an extreme low dose or for a short period of time ( <7 days),vitaminB6remainedtheprimarytreatmentoption.
Patients who met criteria 1–3 were given vitamin B6 at an initial dose of 10 mg/kg/day orally or 100–200 mg/day intravenously for at least seven days, while observing the eﬃcacy, including seizure frequency and EEG. If the seizure was controlled after 1 week of vitamin B6 treatment, maintai n the original dose of vitamin B6 treatment.If there was a signiﬁcant reduction in the frequency of seizures within se ven days or a signiﬁcant improvement in EEG, vitamin B6 therapy was maintained and the observation period was extended to 2 weeks or longer, while the EEG was regularly reviewed.Other management protocols for IS could be added at the same time.If the seizure frequency did not change in the ﬁrst week, then vitamin B6 would be discontinued and the next treatment was quicklymovedon.Atthesametime,suchpatientswereexcluded fromthisstudy.
Genetic Analysis For 30 patients with vitamin B6-responsive IS, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in 17 cases and gene panel test was performed in 13 cases. DNA extracted from peripheral blood from 17 patients and family members was analyzed using trio-based WES, which was performed at the local genetic institutes using next-generation sequencing.For other 13 patients who had undergone gene panel test, targeted sequencing was performed on genomic DNA samples from the proband and his/her parents for 535 epilepsy genes by MyGenostics Technology, Inc.(Beijing, China).Sequence variants were checked with population databases gnomAD (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) and the Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD, https://cadd.gs.
washington.edu/) score, and functional impact of mutations was predicted by three diﬀerent in silicotools, including Polyphen2, SIFT,andMutationTaster.Variantpathogenicitywasinterpre ted accordingtotheAmericanCollegeofMedicalGenetics(ACMG) guidelines( 15).

All patients had uneventful pre-and perinatal periods. The age of ES onset was from 3 months to 12 months ( Table1).Twenty- eight patients developed ES at onset and this was the only form of the disease in progress.Two other patients manifested as focal seizures initially at the age of 3 and 2 months, respecti vely (patient 12 and 20), followed by ES at 9 and 1 month later.Notably, patient 12 developed myoclonic seizures and atypical absenceat2yearsofage.Allpatientsweretreatedwithhigh-dosevitaminB6atvarious times after ES onset, from 1 day to 5 months.Of 30 patients, 22 patientswerenottreatedwithanyASMspriortovitaminB6,and nine of them received vitamin B6 monotherapy throughout the courseofthedisease.Four patientsweretreatedwithvitami nB6 and topiramate (TPM) simultaneously, and the episodes ceased at the 1, 3, 4, and 7 days, respectively after treatment.
Of the other nine patients, the frequency of seizures was signiﬁcan tly reduced after treatment with vitamin B6, and then TPM or levetiracetam (LEV) was added within 1 to 45 days, after whic h theseizuresdisappeared.Additionally,eightpatientsweretr eated with multiple ASMs prior to vitamin B6, and only one patient (patient 12) had a transient response to ASMs treatment. Patien t 12 developed focal seizures 3 months after birth and was controlled by oral valproic acid (VPA) treatment.Nine month s later, the patient presented with ES, and VPA supplementation showednoeﬀect.After3months,hewasadmittedtothehospital and given vitamin B6 intravenously for three consecutive days, butnoeﬀectwasobserved.Subsequently,ESwascontrolledaf ter treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).Then, this patient received VPA therapy and remained seizure-free f or 1 year.At 2 years of age, ES recurred, and myoclonic seizures andatypicalabsencecouldbeobservedsimultaneously.Multiple ASMs were ineﬀective.
Five months later, he had no episodes after 7 days of intravenous vitamin B6. Since then, therapy wi th vitaminB6andotherASMswasperformeddaily,andASMswere gradually withdrawn after one and a half years without seizur e recurred.By the time of the last follow-up (12 years of age), the patient had been seizure-free for nearly 10 years and vitamin B6 treatmentwasmaintained(180mg/day).Of the 30 patients treated with vitamin B6, ES ceased completely within 24h of life in 6 patients, 1–3 days in 11, 3– 11 days in 11, and as late as 1 month and 2 months in two patients (patient 2 and 14), respectively.The two patients who required a relatively long time for seizure control underwe nt a longcourseofmedicationadjustmentandobservation.Incas e2, the seizure was signiﬁcantly reduced after vitamin B6 treat ment, and was not improved after TPM [5.0 mg/(kg ·day)] added at the age of 10 months.
However, reducing the dose of vitamin B6 duringtreatmentledtoanincreaseinepisodesandthenrestor ing its dose to its original level. Finally, after the combinati on of vitamin B6 (60 mg/day) and TPM (25 mg/day), the seizures were completely controlled at the age of 11 months.Similarly, patient 14 developed ES episodes 4 months after birth and was treated orally with vitamin B6 10 days later.With vitamin B6 monotherapy, the frequency of ES was signiﬁcantly reduced, but the patient still had a small number of isolated episodes Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org 4 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 895978 Jiao et al.Study of Vitamin B6-Responsive IS occasionally.Subsequently, a small amount of TPM was added amonthandahalflater,andtheseizuresdisappearedcompletely after15days.EEG and Brain MRI The EEGs of all patients indicated hypsarrhythmia at onset.Follow-up EEG results were not available in 2 out of the 30 patients.
One patient (patient 20) was due to early death, and the other (patient 26) did not undergo reexamination after hi gh- dose vitamin B6 treatment. Of the 28 cases in which results were obtained, the corresponding EEG results of 26 patients were normal.In 21 out of 26 patients, the epileptic discharges weresuppressedwithin6monthsandremainednormalafterthe initiation of high-dose vitamin B6 therapy.Three patients’ E EGs returned to normal within 10 months to 1 year.The EEG of the othertwopatientsreturnedtonormalafter2yearsofvitamin B6 maintenancetherapy.Ofthe26cases,4haddevelopmentaldelay and 22 had normal development.The time for EEG to return to normal in 22 patients with normal development ranged from 14 days to 2 years (mean =111.5 days; median =52.5 days).The time for EEG to return to normal in the other 4 patients with development delay ranged from 4 months to 2 years (mean = 375 days; median =330 days).
Of the remaining two patients withabnormalEEG,theresultsofpatient12indicateddischa rges in occipital and right anterior regions at the age of 10 years, and the seizure had been controlled for nearly 10 years, but th e development is severely backward. The EEG results of patient 30 showed focal discharges in the right central and parietal regions, and generalized fast waves after the disappearance o f hypsarrhythmia at the age of three, but no EEG review was availableafterseveralyearsofseizurecontrol.Brain MRI results of 26 patients were obtained, 17 of whom were normal.Nine patients showed diﬀerent abnormalities at a n earlierage,butwerenotreviewedatalaterstage.Follow-Up and Neurodevelopment During the follow-up (rang from 1 year to 10 years and 2 months), 28 patients were seizure-free all the time.The othe r two patients (3 and 30) had recurrent seizures due to an attempt to reduce vitamin B6 dose at 1 month and 8 months after treatment, respectively.
The diﬀerence was that when treatme nt with vitamin B6 was resumed, the seizure of patient 3 was re- controlled, but the same eﬀect was not seen in patient 30. The seizure of ES in patient 30 reoccurred after 2 months of vitami n B6 withdrawal.However, the addition of vitamin B6 failed to control the seizures, either orally or intravenously, and w as eventually resolved by combination with TPM at the age of 2 yearsand9monthsandconcurrentwithdrawalofvitaminB6.Uptothelastfollow-up,29patientssurvived,andonepatient (case 20) with severe developmental delay died due to persiste nt fever and pneumonia 10 months later at the age of 1 year and 3 months.The age of the 29 surviving patients ranged from 8 months to 15 years.Seizures were controlled well in these 29 patients.Twenty-one patients were deactivated from all medications, including vitamin B6, at the last follow-up.Discontinuation of vitamin B6 was performed on a case-by-cas e basis.
Twenty patients were desorbed with vitamin B6 between 8monthsandtwoandahalfyearsafterseizurefree.Theotherc ase (patient 23) showed a rapid decrease in vitamin B6 withdrawal, which was discontinued 2 months after seizure disappeared and twoandahalfmonthsafterEEGreturnedtonormal.Noneofthe 21 patients with vitamin B6 withdrawn had seizures recurrenc e. FivepatientscontinuedtreatmentwithvitaminB6monothera py, and four of whom remained seizure free for approximately 2 months to 1 year prior to the last follow-up.Another patient (patient 12) maintained vitamin B6 treatment for nearly 10 years(180mg/day)withabnormalEEG.Fortheremainingthre e patients (case 15, 19, and 30), vitamin B6 was withdrawn after a period of seizure control, and low-dose TPM monotherapy wasmaintained.All patients showed normal neurodevelopment prior to epilepsy onset.After seizure onset, 16 patients showed varying degrees of developmental delay.
Among them, nine patients improved gradually after the seizure was controlled, and had recovered to normal levels similar to those of their peers at t he last follow-up. Up to the last follow up, the neurodevelopment wasnormalin23,milddelayin1,moderatedelayin1,andsever e delayin5(onedied).DISCUSSION SinceOhtaharaﬁrstattemptedtotreatISwithhigh-dosevitam in B6,ithadbeenrecognizedasthepreferredtreatmentofchoic ein IS, especially in Japan ( 2,16), which has been few changes in the last 20 years.In the past decade or so, treatment of IS patients with pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate has been reported intermittently ( 2–9).It’s now generally accepted that vitamin B6 therapy should be tried ﬁrst when IS was diagnosed, rather than other IS management protocols.
Among IS patients, the proportion of patients who respond to high doses of vitamin B6 remainssmall.Inthisstudy,wereported30patientswithvita min B6-responsive IS, described and analyzed their clinical feat ures, treatment processes, genetics, neurodevelopmental outcome s andfollow-updata. Ohtahara et al.( 6) suggested that 100–200 mg/day or 20– 30 mg/kg/day of vitamin B6 should be initiated in patients diagnosed as IS, and if eﬃcacy is not apparent in the ﬁrst week, it is better to increase the dose to 300–400 mg/day or 40–50 mg/kg/day,carefullyobservingseizurefrequencyandtoler ability.In our cohort, all patients received aninitial oral dose of vi tamin B6 of 10 mg/kg/day or an intravenous dose of 100–200 mg/day.Obviously, we were getting the same treatment at a lower dose thanreportedinternationally.Becausetheenrolledpatients were treated in diﬀerent hospitals before, the ﬁrst treatment stra tegy was not uniform.
In some patients, TPM and LEV were added at the beginning of vitamin B6 treatment or 1–7 days after treatment, which brings uncertainty to determine the eﬃcac y of vitamin B6 treatment. Because the dosage of TPM or LEV was much lower than the minimum eﬀective maintenance, we do not think it had strong enough eﬀects to control the seizures in these patients.Nevertheless, we recommend that other drugs should not be added during the observation of the eﬃcacy of vitamin B6 in IS patients, especially for the ﬁrst Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 895978 Jiao et al.Study of Vitamin B6-Responsive IS 7 days, so as not to aﬀect the judgment of eﬀectiveness of vitaminB6.
In a previous observational study of vitamin B6-responsive IS, the eﬀectiveness of vitamin B6 in controlling seizures wa s apparentwithin1weekin80%ofpatients,andbythe11thdayin allresponsivepatients( 8).Besides,Riikonenetal.showedthatin responders,eﬃcacyisobservedwithin1to2weeks( 9).Similarly, inourcohort,93%ofpatientswereundercontrolwithin11day s, andeven20%hadtheirepisodescompletelyresolvedwithin24h ofuse.So,a1–2-weekobservationperiodcanidentifymoreth an 90% of patients with vitamin B6-responsive IS. Therefore, som e scholarssuggestthattheeﬃcacyofvitaminB6isusuallyass essed after1–2weeksofuse.IfvitaminB6doesnotwork,movequick ly to the next treatment.But in cases where vitamin B6 treatmen t has been eﬀective, its eﬀects are slow to show up in some patients.In our cohort, the spasms of two patients disappeared at 1 and 2 months, respectively, a little later than others.
Bu t during treatment, the frequency of seizures in both patients was signiﬁcantly reduced, though not completely eliminated. Ima i et al.reported on an IS patient who was treated with vitamin B6 for 30 days until the seizures disappeared ( 17).Therefore, in individual patients, the response to vitamin B6 is not rapid.At this time, it is necessary to extend the treatment cycle in ti me accordingtothecurativeeﬀectandEEGchanges.However, in some cases, the eﬃcacy of vitamin B6 therapy has not been properly evaluated.For example, the patient 12 in our cohort developed ES at 1 year of age and was treated with vitamin B6.However, as no eﬀect was observed within 3 days, ACTH therapy was subsequently switched to.At 2 years and 5 monthsofage,recurrentseizureswerecontrolledaftersev endays oftreatmentwithvitaminB6.Inaddition,acaseofISreporte dby Imai et al.( 17) experienced a similar situation.The patient was started the symptom at 9 months and received oral treatment of vitamin B6.
However, because the EEG did not return to normal after a week, vitamin B6 was considered ineﬀective even witho ut seizures.TreatmentwassubsequentlyswitchedtoACTH,and the seizures recurred at the age of one. Despite receiving a varie ty of conventional medications and a second ACTH treatment, her seizures were not suppressed.Vitamin B6 was treated again at 3 years and 6 months, and as a result she became seizure- free and hypsarrhythmia disappeared on EEG within a month.Then, Imai et al., suggested that a retrial of vitamin B6 at a l ater date could be worthwhile in cases of IS who had not responded previouslyandhadrelapsedafterACTH( 17).However,thebasic reason of the secondary treatment of vitamin B6 in these two patientswastheshortobservationperiodofvitaminB6treatm ent and misjudgment of eﬃcacy.The most important factor in determining eﬃcacy was whether the seizures controlled, no t whethertheEEGreturnedtonormal,becausetheseizuresusu ally stopped before the EEG returned to normal.
Therefore, in the course of vitamin B6 treatment, it was important to pay close attention to changes in the frequency of seizures under suﬃc ient observation time, and the change of EEG should be used as an auxiliaryindicator. Previous studies have shown that the EEG was important to monitor the course of treatment, in predicting relapse or in deciding whether to withdraw vitamin B6 therapy ( 8).Ohtaharaet al.suggested that EEG examination at least once a week was recommended in the evaluation of the eﬃcacy of vitamin B6 ( 8).OurpreviousstudyalsosuggestedthatEEGshouldbeconducte d weekly to assess the eﬃcacy of initial treatment, and examin ed every 1–3 months to evaluate the therapeutic eﬀect ( 14).This was also conﬁrmed in our follow-up of 30 patients.Especially in patients whose EEG has not returned to normal for a long time, the EEG should be reviewed regularly to determine the progression of the disease.
Regular EEG follow-up was known to predict the relapse of clinical seizures ( 8). Fortunately, in our cohort, worsening of EEG and recurrent seizures were not observed in all patients whose EEG returned to normal and vitaminB6discontinuation.The duration of vitamin B6 withdrawal depended on EEG changes.However, the timing of withdrawal of vitamin B6 and the outcome after discontinuation have not yet been clariﬁed .The latest viewpoint was that two or more years being free of spikesonEEGmightindicateasuccessfulwithdrawalofvitam in B6 (8).In our cohort, 21 patients of this series had successfully discontinuedallmedicationsaftertheirEEGreturnedtono rmal, withnorecurrence.Inthese21patients,epilepticdischargesw ere suppressed within 2 years (range =14 days to 2 years) after the initiation of high-dose vitamin B6 therapy, and 81% (17/2 1 cases) within 6 months.
It could not be ruled out that the EEG of some patients might have returned to normal at an earlier time, but it has not been observed due to the absence of regula r review. Then vitamin B6 was deactivated between 2.5 months and 2 years after EEG normalization.Considering most patien ts’ EEG recovered within 6 months in our study, and that they discontinued vitamin B6 after another 1–2 years of maintena nce therapy.For patients whose EEG returned to normal shortly after treatment, continuation of vitamin B6 for 1 to 2 years a fter EEG normalization is recommended.For individual patients with persistently abnormal EEG, the treatment period might be extended to 2 years or more.Cases of early withdrawal could be observedinpreviousstudies,andtheirtreatmentcyclelast edonly 6weeksatanoraldoseofvitaminB6150mg/day( 9).Becauseof this, Riikonen et al.
( 9) suggested that if vitamin B6 was treated with a smaller dose than previously studied, it could be stopped afterarelativelyshorttreatmentperiodintheabsenceofse izures or hypsarrhythmia EEG. All of our patients received lower doses of vitamin B6 than reported in the literature.However, spasms recurred due to vitamin B6 withdrawal were observed in two patients, after being controlled for 1 and 8 months, respectiv ely, although the EEG was no longer hypsarrhythmia.Therefore, taking a relatively low dose of vitamin B6 still does not repres ent anearlywithdrawal.IS was associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcome (1).A study of neurodevelopment in IS patients showed that regarding the cognition scale (Bayley-III developmenta l assessments), only 12% patients were within the normal range , and “severe delay” was found in 77% ( 18).In our cohort, when untreated or initially treated with vitamin B6, 53% patients showed varying degrees of developmental delay.
At the last follow-up, 77% (23/30) patients were normal in neurodevelopment, which was prominently higher than that reportedpreviously.Thissuggestedthattheneurodevelopment al Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org 6 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 895978 Jiao et al. Study of Vitamin B6-Responsive IS outcomes and prognosis of vitamin B6-responsive IS were more favorable than those of other patients with IS.Besides, ther e were six patients in this group with severe developmental delay before treatment, and there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in delayed treatment time.After long-term treatment, there w as no signiﬁcant change in developmental status in four cases, o ne was moderate, and one died.Therefore, for IS patients with severe developmental delay, even if the seizure was controll ed by vitamin B6, the later development was diﬃcult to improve to normal.
In addition, four of seven patients with developmenta l delay had normal EEG at the last follow-up, two had abnormal EEG, and one died. Compared with other patients, EEG of these four patients took longer to return to normal, and vitamin B6 wasstoppedlaterorevenfailedtostop.Therefore,itmighttak ea longertimeforEEGtoreturntonormalandtostoptakingdrug s in patients with persistent or unimproved developmental delay, eveniftherewasnoseizureaftertreatment.Limitations Our study had several limitations.Due to the retrospective and prospective nature of this study, some patients received inconsistent treatment before the experimental treatment o f vitamin B6, and even TPM and vitamin B6 combined treatment occurred.
Lack of understanding of vitamin B6-responsive IS leads to diﬀerences in parental compliance and physician treatment guidelines, resulting in inconsistent interval s of EEG reexaminationformostpatients.Duringtreatment,wenegle cted tomonitorthesideeﬀectsofvitaminB6.However,bydescribi ng thepresentationof30vitaminB6-responsiveIS,thisstudyhe lped to made clinical recommendations on response observation period and treatment duration of vitamin B6, and formulate th e standard of diagnosis and treatment for vitamin B6-responsi ve IS,whichwouldbeveryhelpfulforclinicalpractitioners. CONCLUSION In this study, we report 30 patients with vitamin B6-responsive IS.By describing and analyzing their clinical features and treatment processes, we reveal that an observation period of 1–2 weeks can identify more than 90% of patients with vitamin B6-responsive IS.At the same time, it is necessary to extend the treatment time in time according to the treatment response and EEG changes.
For patients whose EEG returned to normal shortly after treatment, discontinuation of vita minB6 1 to 2 years after EEG normalization is recommended. Neurodevelopmental outcomes and prognosis of vitamin B6- responsive IS were more favorable than those of other patients with IS.It might take a longer time for EEG to return to normal and to stop taking drugs in patients with persistent or unimproved developmental delay, even if there was no seizure aftertreatment.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The original contributions presented in the study are includ ed in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directedtothecorrespondingauthor.ETHICS STATEMENT The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Biomedical Research Ethical Committee of Peking University First Hospital.Written informed consent to participate in this study was provided by the participants’ legal guardian/next of kin.
