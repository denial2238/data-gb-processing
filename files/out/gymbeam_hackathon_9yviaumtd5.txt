Recent reports on hereditary neuropathy due to pyridoxal kinase (PDXK) mutations may provide some insight into the mechanism, as genetic deﬁciencies in PDXK lead to the development of axonal sensory neuropathy. High circulating concentrations of PN may lead to a similar condition via the inhibition of PDXK.

Statement of Significance : The number of reported cases of sensory peripheral neuropathy due to the use of vitamin B-6 supplements is increasing. Despite a long history of study, the pathogenic mechanism(s) associated with the toxicity of pyridoxine remain elusive.In our review,werevealthemostplausiblemechanisticlinkbetweenpyridoxinesupplementationandsensoryperipheralneuropathy.Keywords: vitaminB-6,pyridoxine,toxicity,pyridoxalkinase,GABA,neuropathy Introduction In nonruminant animals, vitamin B-6 is an essential, water- soluble vitamin ( 1), which is found in a variety of food sources including meat, poultry, fish, legumes, nuts, cereals, vegetables, and bananas ( 2).Vitamin B-6 is a generic term that refers to the pyridine-based compounds pyridoxine(PN), pyridoxamine (PM), pyridoxal (PL), and their phos- phorylated derivatives.
In human adults, the recommended daily oralintakeof vitaminB-6 fallsbetween 1.5 and1.8 mg(3) .D u et oi t sa b u n d a n c ei nf o o ds o u r c e s ,v i t a m i nB - 6 deficiency in humans is rare and typically the result of a geneticdeficiencyorpharmaceuticalinterference( 4).Never- theless, the consumption of dietary supplements containing vitamin B-6 is common among the general population. PN is the form of vitamin B-6 most frequently used in dietarysupplements and/or fortified food and beverage products, such as energy drinks ( 5).Previously, high doses of PN have been used to treat a number of conditions including vitamin B-6-dependent epilepsy, carpal tunnel syndrome,premenstrual syndrome, mushroom poisoning, autism, hy- perkinesis, and even Parkinson disease ( 6).Similarly, high- dosePNsupplementationisfrequentlyusedbyathletes,suchasbodybuilders( 5).
Starting in the 1980s, a number of case reports described symptomsofsensoryneuropathyinpeopletakinglargedosesofPNforprolongedperiodsoftime.PN-inducedneuropathy is characterized by symmetric, progressive impairments in touch, pin-prick, temperature, vibrational, and positionalsense at the extremities ( 6,7). PN toxicity leads to both small- and large-fiber neuropathies ( 8,9).In humans, there C⃝TheAuthor(s)2021.PublishedbyOxfordUniversityPressonbehalfoftheAmericanSocietyforNutrition.ThisisanOpenAccessarticledistributedu nderthetermsoftheCreativeCommons Attribution-NonCommercialLicense( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ ),whichpermitsnon-commercialre-use,distribution,andreproductioninanymedium,providedthe originalworkisproperlycited.Forcommercialre-use,pleasecontact journals.permissions@oup.com .Adv Nutr2021;12:1911–1929; doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmab033.
1911 is strongevidence that small-fiber dysfunctionis the earliest and predominant clinical manifestation ( 10). While the incidenceofPN-inducedneuropathyinhumansislikelylow, reports by neuropathic centers indicate that it may be more widespread than previously thought, with a prevalence in 2 cohorts of neuropathy patients between 2.5% and 12.4% (8,11).Additionally, PN-induced small-fiber neuropathy may be underdiagnosed.Small-fiber neuropathies are more challenging to diagnose as nerve-conduction studies are often normal in these cases.More sensitive diagnosticprocedures such as quantitative sensory threshold (QST) testingorskinbiopsyareoftennotused( 12,13).In their assessment of the evidence, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 25 mg/d, while the US-based Food and Nutrition Board recommends a UL of 100 mg/d ( 6).
Alarmingly, a number of more recent case reports have described neuropathic symptoms in patients taking PN at d o s e sn e a ro re v e nb e l o wt h eE F S AU L( 14,15). In light of these reports, the UL for PN may require revision.The absence of neuropathic symptoms at these doses under more controlled observational settings could be related to large interindividual differences in sensitivity to PN toxicity.Additionally, small-fiber abnormalities may not have beendetected.Remarkably, single-dose tablets with high doses of PN (20–100 mg) are widely available in stores.Considering the accessibility of these PN supplements to the generalpopulation,itssafetyprofileshouldbefurtherinvestigated.In order to better characterize the safety profile of PN supplementation, the mechanism of toxicity has to beclarified.
Despite a long history of study, the pathogenic mechanisms associated with PN toxicity remain elusive and there is even a lack of consensus over which vitamin B-6 vitamer leads to neuropathy. Several competing theories have been proposed to explain its mechanism of action.These include aldehyde toxicity through elevated pyridoxal5 ′-phosphate (PLP) concentrations, the formation of reac- tive quinone methide-type intermediates, the competitive inhibition of PLP-dependent enzymes, and the saturation of pyridoxal kinase (PDXK) ( 4,16–19).Many aspects of the proposed hypotheses are unexplored, and even thebasic assumptions they are grounded in can be contested, particularly concerning PN pharmacokinetics, toxicologi- cal testing, and vitamin B-6 metabolism.Therefore, the Theauthorsreportednofundingreceivedforthiswork.Authordisclosures:Theauthorsreportnoconflictsofinterest.AddresscorrespondencetoMV(e-mail: m.vrolijk@maastrichtuniversity.nl ).

Current Status of Knowledge FunctionofvitaminB-6 PLP, the bioactive form of vitamin B-6, is a remarkably versatile cofactor that participates widely in metabolicpathwaysinvolvingaminoacid,oxoacid,oraminesubstrates. In humans, at least 56 PLP-dependent enzymes have been described ( 20).These PLP-dependent reactions contribute, for instance, to glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the biosynthesis of hemoglobin, sphingolipids, neurotransmit- ters,andhormones( 1).Metabolism Inhumans,themajorformsofvitaminB-6includePN,PM, PL, their phosphorylated derivatives, and the metabolic end product 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA).All forms of vitamin B-6 are present in food sources and are converted into PLP by the “B-6 salvage pathway” shown in Figure 1.Under normal dietary circumstances, the majority of absorbed PNand PM are converted into PLP and released as PL in the small intestine.With normal vitamin B-6 intake, there are negligible amounts of PN and PM in the portal veinand/or circulation ( 21–23).
With higher doses, the liver is the primary site of PN metabolism ( 24,25). In the blood, vitaminB-6ispresentprimarilyasPLPandtoalesserextent as PL and 4-PA ( 26).Vitamin B-6 metabolism in humans hasbeendiscussedingreaterdetailinreviewsbyParraetal.(27),Coburn( 26)andEFSA( 3).Recently,PL/PLPreductase activity was identified in humans.PLP-treated patients had increased PN concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinalfluid.ThereductionofPLtoPNhasbeenobservedinalarge variety of mammalian cell types.This PL reductase activity islikelymoreimportantunderconditionsofhighPLand/orunboundPLPconcentrations( 28).Intracellulartraﬃcking PLP is a highly reactive aldehyde and can form harmful, unproductive bonds with amine and thiol groups ( 4).As a result, its intracellular concentration and traffickingis under tight regulation.This ensures adequate supply to apo-enzymes while preventing harmful unproductive reactions.
PLP availability in the cell is determined by the supply of PLP precursors, biosynthesis by PDXK and pyridoxine-5’-phosphate oxidase (PNPO), PLP scavengingby proteins and small molecules, and PLP hydrolysis by PDXP (4,29). The expression of both PNPO and PDXK is regulated at the transcriptional level and likely dependson the activity of PLP-dependent enzymes and vitamin B-6 availability( 30,31).IntracellularPLPtraffickingisfacilitated by proteins such as PLP-binding protein (PLPBP), PDXK,and PNPO ( 32).
Additionally, both PDXK and PNPO were shown to directly transfer PLP to vitamin B-6-dependent 1912 HadtsteinandVrolijk FIGURE1 ThevitaminB-6salvagepathway.ThediﬀerentvitamersareconvertedintoPLPthroughthe“B-6salvagepathway,”involving theenzymesPDXK,PNPO,andPDXP.PLPentersthecirculationboundtolysineresiduesofproteins,mostlyalbumin.Inordertoenterthe cell,thephosphorylatedvitamersarehydrolyzedbyALPL.Onceinsidethecell,PDXKphosphorylatesthediﬀerentvitamers,yieldingPNP, PMP,andPLP.PMPandPNPareconvertedintoPLPbyPNPO.TransaminasereactionsmayalsointerconvertPMPandPLPasasidereaction.PDXP,alongwithotherphosphatases,hydrolyzephosphorylatedvitaminB-6vitamers,enablingthemtoexitthecell.PLiseliminatedfrom thebodyfollowingitsconversionto4-PA,catalyzedbyAOX1.AKRscanconvertPLandPLPintoPNandPNP,respectively;howeverthese activitieslikelyplayonlyaminorroleinvitaminB-6metabolism.AKR,aldo-ketoreductase;ALPL,tissue-nonspeciﬁcalkalinephosphatase;AOX1,aldehydeoxidase;PDXK,pyridoxalkinase;PDXP,pyridoxalphosphatase;PL,pyridoxal;PLP,pyridoxal5 ′-phosphate;PM, pyridoxamine;PMP,pyridoxamine5’-phosphate;PN,pyridoxine;PNP,pyridoxine-5’-phosphate;PNPO,pyridoxine5′-phosphateoxidase; 4-PA,4-pyridoxicacid.
Mechanismofpyridoxinetoxicity 1913 apo-enzymes and forgo releasing their product into the solvent. The activation of vitamin B-6-dependent apo-enzymes was more efficient using PLP synthesized from PNPO and PDXK compared with free PLP ( 33,34).In addition, exogenous PLP was found to form unproductive aldimines with cellular components ( 34).Interestingly, PNPO and PDXKhave significantlydifferentbindingaffinitiesandPLP transfer efficiencies with different vitamin B-6-dependent apo-enzymes ( 35,36).These differences may be indicative of process-specific functions for PNPO and PDXK.Certain PLP-dependent processes may be more reliant on 1 enzyme system over theother.Additionally,theexpression ofPNPOandPDXKvariesconsiderablybetweendifferenttissues( 37, 38).Hence, vitamin B-6 homeostasis is complex, and highly regulated.
VitaminB-6indisease As vitamin B-6 plays an important role in many different processes, lacking sufficient amounts of the vitamin B-6vitamersmayleadtoadversehealthconditions.VitaminB-6 deficiency in humans is associated with anemia, dermatitis, glossitis, electroencephalographic abnormalities, depressionand confusion, and weakened immune function. In infants, a vitamin B-6 deficiency may lead to irritability, abnormally a c u t eh e a r i n g ,a n dc o n v u l s i v es e i z u r e s( 39).Moreover, inborn errors in vitamin B-6 metabolism such as PNPO, PLPBP, alkaline phosphatase, tissue-nonspecific isozyme (ALPL), and antiquitin (ALDH7A1) are linked to neonatal epileptic seizures ( 40–45).Interestingly, genetic deficiencies inPDXKareassociatedwithperipheralneuropathy( 46,47).Given the importance of PLP within neuronal tissue, dis- ruptionsinvitaminB-6homeostasislikelyhaveneurological consequences,suchaswithPNtoxicity.ClinicalpresentationofPN-inducedneuropathy.
The clinical presentation for PN-induced neuropathy inhumans is largely drawn from a series of case reportsinvolving large doses, typically in excess of 2 g/d, taken over many months to years ( 6). The case reports found that excessive PN intake led to progressive sensory peripheralneuropathy.Neurological symptoms included paresthesia, hyperesthesia, bone pains, muscle weakness, numbness, fas- ciculations,andlossoftendonreflexes.Symptomsprimarilyfollowed a stocking-glove distribution, although there are several reports of facial numbness and mild autonomic dysfunction ( 7,9,48–51).The initial symptoms typically involved paresthesia in the toes, and gradually progressed into symptoms related to sensory ataxia including gait,loss of balance and difficulty handling small objects.At these stages, sense of touch, temperature, and pain were typically less affected than the other modalities ( 7,48).
Electrophysiological studies found absent distal sensory nerve conduction action potentials with mild to preserved motorinvolvement.Somatosensoryevokedpotentialstudiesfound a severe to absent impairment in proximal nerve conduction. Sural nerve biopsy showed widespread axonaldegenerationofbothlarge-andsmall-fibernerves.Following withdrawal from PN, symptoms often progressed beforegradually improving.Dramatic improvements were usually observed within ∼6 mo; however, distal sensory perception was often diminished.During recovery, loss of vibrational sense persisted longer than with the other modalities.In those who were followed up, patients were almost fullyrecoveredwithin2–3y ( 6,7,48).These clinical observations were confirmed by a con- trolled study that investigated the dose-response of 12–56.9ímg PN ·kg −1·d−1in 5 healthy men.
Within the study, the onset of symptoms was associated with the dose admin- istered.Thevolunteer,receiving56.9mgPN ·kg−1·d−1,com- plained of symptoms within 1.5 mo, while the participant, receiving the lowest dose of 12mg PN ·kg−1·d−1, had symp- tomswithin7mo.Inallofthevolunteerswithcomplaints,theseverityofthesymptoms,particularlyparesthesia,worsened for2–3wkafterdiscontinuingPN.Inthevolunteersreceiving 1 g/d, the predominant symptom involved reduced thermalsensory thresholds, particularly in the toes. In contrast, the volunteers receiving 3 g/d had concurrent and equal vibrational and thermal sensory threshold reductions.At all doses, QST abnormalities preceded changes in nerve- conduction studies.These findings strongly support a dose-dependent relation for both the onset and vulnerability of different caliber axons in PN toxicity.Additionally, it indicatesthatQSTtestingmaybemoresensitiveindetectingearlychangesinPN-inducedneuropathy( 10).Dose–responserelation.
The minimum dose and treatment duration necessary to elicit neuropathy has not been firmly established ( 6). While many isolated case reports describe neuropathy in patients taking PN at doses well below 500 mg/d, PN toxicity at these doses may not be fully supported by the controlledstudies.Multiple controlled studies found that PN doses of 100–500 mg/d were well tolerated; however, the duration of treatment was likely too short to assess neurologicaleffects (6).Additional studies found that PN doses of 200– 500mg/dtakenforseveralyearsdidnotleadtoneurological symptoms.Mitwalli et al.( 52)f o u n dt h a tP Nd o s e so f 250–500 mg/d for 8 mo to 6 y produced no neurological effectsin22patientstreatedforhyperoxaluria( 52).Another study found that PN doses of 200–500 mg/d administeredfrom birth for 7–24 y were well tolerated in 17 patients treated for homocystinuria ( 53).
However, these studies may not be applicable to the general population because of possible interactions with the underlying health conditions. Furthermore, these observational studies were not subjectto double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation, and were limited by insufficient monitoring of PN intake, small group size,andinadequateassessmentofadverseeffects( 6).A number of more recent case reports have described symptoms of neuropathy in people taking PN at doses near or even below the EFSA UL of 25 mg/d.In 2005,de Kruijk and Notermans ( 54) reported on 2 patients who developed symptoms of sensory neuropathy after taking 1914 HadtsteinandVrolijk PN doses of 24 and 40 mg/d, who recovered following discontinuation.Another case report, involving a patientwho self-administered 30 mg PN/d, confirmed a case of sensory ataxic ganglionopathy using electrophysiological studies.However, in this case, high consumption of PN- containing energy drinks may have been a contributing factor (55).
Additionally, from 1991 until July 2017, the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb received 90 reportsofvitaminB-6-relatedneuropathywithdosesranging from 1.4 to 100 mg/tablet ( 14,15). The most common symptoms involved numbness and paresthesia, which is consistent with the early symptoms described in previous casereports.In82ofthecases,therewasanobservedlatencyin response.In 30 cases, symptoms diminished following discontinuation; however, in 29 cases, symptoms did not improve.Amajorlimitationofthiscaseserieswasthelackofinformation on PN intake.Vitamin B-6 content in products and whether the patient took more than the advised dosage could not be verified.Plasma vitamin B-6 concentrationsw e r ek n o w ni no n l y3 6c a s e sa n dd o s a g ew a so n l yk n o w n in 37 cases.
Given the inherent limitations of isolated case reports,itisnotpossibletoinferacausalrelationattheselow doses(15).Thesereportsdo,however,indicatethepossibility of significant interindividual differences in sensitivity to PNtoxicity and toxicity at doses <25 mg/d within vulnerable individuals. Animal studies.PN-inducedneuropathyhasbeenobservedinmanyanimals, including dogs, rats, mice, cats, chickens, rabbits, and guinea pigs ( 56–60).The dose–response and associated histopathological changes have been closely monitored inrats and dogs.In rats, 3 intraperitoneal dosing regimens were generally used including 1200mg ·kg −1·d−1for 1–15 d, 600mg ·kg−1·d−1for 1–15 d, and 100–300mg ·kg−1·d−1 for up to 12 wk ( 6,61).In rats receiving acutely toxic doses,theexpressionofsensoryataxiawasdependentonthe cumulative dose.Symptoms of ataxia and neuronal necrosismanifested when the total PN dose reached about 4 g/kg.
At doses of 300mg ·kg −1·d−1or less, symptoms of ataxia were not observed even when the cumulative dose exceeded25 g/kg. At doses of 300mg ·kg −1·d−1and over, the initial changesinvolveddamagetothecellbodiesofneurons,while lower doses were initially characterized by axonal atrophy.At all doses, the initial changes occurred at the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons in the L4–5 spinal regions.This was followed by secondary damage to their central and peripheralprocesseswithinthespinalnervesandspinalcord while sparing the ventral and lateral regions.Additionally,the nerve fibers derived from the L4–5 spinal region were damaged, including the sciatic, tibial, sural, and plantar nerves.Atdoses <200mg ·kg −1·d−1over12wk,damagewas limited to DRG axons and the endings of long nerve fibers (61,62).
In contrast to rats, both acute and subacute toxicity producedproprioceptivedeficitsindogs.Dogsreceivingoral doses of 100–300mg ·kg−1·d−1developed proprioceptiveabnormalities in the hindquarters within 9–100 d. Tissue examination found extensive neuronal cell body degener-ation in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar DRG regions.Additionally, there was damage present at sensory nerve fibers, the descending spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, d o r salr oo t s ,a n dth ed o r salh o rna n dfu n i cul u so fth es p i n al cord.Adjacent regions of the spinal cord were unaffected(56,61,63).Dogs receiving 50mg ·kg −1·d−1over 100 d did not develop any observable clinical sequelae; however, modesthistopathologicalchangesweredetectedatthedorsalfuniculus( 63).DogsreceivingPNhaveasimilaranatomical distribution and histopathological response as rats.
The differenceinsensitivitytoPNtoxicitybetweenratsanddogsmayberelatedtoexcretion.RatswereobservedtoexcretePN primarilyinitsunchangedformwhile,indogs,4-PAwasthe predominantmetaboliteinurine,aswithhumans( 63,64). Compared with humans, animals were less sensitive to PN toxicity.Additionally, many of the animal studies found that PN preferentially targets large-diameter nerve fibers.Large-sized DRG neurons were reportedly more affected than other neurons in both dogs and rats ( 50,65–67).At lower doses in humans, small-fiber deficits are the earliest and predominant indicator.This could be related to the dose-dependent vulnerability of different caliber axons(10).Most of the animal studies did not use diagnostic methods related to small-fiber dysfunction such as QST or skin biopsy.Use of these methods may have resultedin earlier detection of PN-induced neuropathy at lower doses.
Significant proprioceptive deficits were not present in humans receiving doses of 56.9mg ·kg −1·d−1over 1.5 mo (10). However, thermal latency response was reportedly less sensitive than proprioceptive changes in rats receiving 800mg ·kg−1·d−1(68).Presently, it is unclear if larger- d i a m e t e rn e r v efi b e r sa r em o r ev u l n e r a b l ei na n i m a l st h a n in humans.At later progressions in humans, small-fiber modalities are similarly less affected than positional orvibrational sense ( 7,48).Considering that low-dose chronic exposure in animals consistently led to axonal damage, it is unlikely that these changes would not lead to clinical manifestations.There are, however, notable differences for a varietyofDRGpain-processingand/ordrugtargetsbetweenrodents and humans ( 69–72).These differences may be relevant to the toxicological activity of PN.
Clarification of the toxicological target sites and confirmation of targethomology between animal models and humans may be neededtoassesstherelevanceofanimalstudiestohumans. Classification.While there may be significant differences with humans, histopathologicalanalysisofanimalmodelsislikelyrelevant.PN-induced neuropathies in animals share a common anatomical distribution and histopathological response ashumans.Peripheralneuropathiesareoftenclassifiedaseither myelinopathy, axonopathy, or neuronopathy.This refers to the primary site of damage ( 73).There is an indication t h a tl o wl e v e l so fe x p o s u r et oP Nl e dt oa x o n o p a t h yw i t h retrograde degeneration of distal axons.
On the other hand, Mechanismofpyridoxinetoxicity 1915 higher doses led to neuronopathy with necrosis of DRG neuronal cell bodies and secondary damage to nerve fibers.MorphometricanalysisfoundthatPNlesionswerecharacter- ized by an increase in the total number of myelinated axons a n ds i g n i fi c a n td e c r e a s e si nt h em e a na x o na r e aa n dn e r v e fiber densities ( 65). Both chronic and acute PN intoxication involved nuclear and cytoplasmic aberrations in DRG neu-rons.Theintensityofneuronalcellbodyalterationswasdose dependent.This supports the view that axonal degeneration is a secondary effect from sublethal injury to neuronal cellbodies (5,74,75).Ultra-structurally, axonal degeneration was accompanied with reductions in cytoskeleton proteins, chromatolysis, mitochondria and satellite cell proliferations,and enlarged astrocytic processes ( 76).
This is characteristic of Wallerian-type degeneration ( 5), which is a programmed axondeathpathwayandacommonreactiontoalargevarietyof insults( 77). These neuropathological changes and anatomical dis- tribution are consistent with the majority of peripheralneurotoxicants and likely a consequence of the physiology of the sensory ganglia.While the peripheral nervous system (PNS) generally has a tight blood–nerve barrier, the DRG is densely vasculated and has a comparatively high blood- perfusion rate ( 78).Blood vessels in the cell body-rich area of the DRG have large fenestrations and fewer tight junction proteins.The length of sensory nerve fibers is proportional to the capillary surface area of the DRGthey are derived from.The largest DRGs at the S1, L4– 5, and C7–8 levels support the longest nerve fibers in the body (72).As a consequence, neurotoxic compounds, such as PN, preferentially accumulate and injure long primary sensory neurons ( 79).
This leads to a predictable stocking- glove anatomical distribution. The extended lengths ofDRG neurons make them particularly reliant on axoplasmic transport to meet the physiological requirements of distal axons.Axoplasmic transport is an energy- and resource-intensive process.Sublethal exposure to a neurotoxicant disruptsessentialcellularprocesses,therebyinterferingwith axoplasmic transport and leading to a “dying back” of axons (80).ToxicologicalscreeningofvitaminB-6vitamers.There is a lack of consensus over which vitamin B-6 vitamer(s)leadtotheabove-describedprocessesresultingin neuropathy.PLP is highly reactive, and along with PN has been proposed as a possible causative agent in PN neuro- toxicity.Several pyridine-based compounds are neurotoxic, a n dp r e v i o u s l yi tw a ss u g g e s t e dt h a tt h en e u r o t o x i c i t yo fthese compounds may be structurally dependent ( 5).In 1976, Frater-Schroder et al.
( 81) tested the effects of PM, PL, PN, and 7 other synthetic vitamin B-6 analogs in rats.Only PN and PL elicited the characteristic histopathological c h a n g e s .Am o r er e c e n ts t u d yf o u n dt h a tP Ne x c l u s i v e l yl e d to the morphological changes associated with PN-inducedneuropathy. Rats injected with high doses of PM, PL, and PLP did not show an effect on the nerve fibers examined (82).However, the specificity of PN toxicity was not settled b yt h ei nv i t r ot o x i c o l o g i c a la s s a y s .W i n d e b a n k( 18)t e s t e d the effects of PN, PL, PM, PMP, and 4-PA on the neurite outgrowth of rat DRG cells.The study found that PN, PL, and PM all inhibited neurite outgrowth at similar concentrations, between 0.1 and 1 mM, and had no effect at lower concentrations.The other compounds, 4-PA andPMP, produced no ill effects even at concentrations as high as10mM( 18).In contrast, Vrolijk et al.
( 16)f o u n dt h a tP N ,a l r e a d y at concentrations as low as 200 nM, increased cell death of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells by 17%. At concentrations of 400 nM PN, cell death increased to 30%.SubsequentincreasesofPN,upto5 μM,didnotinducefurtherincreases inthecelldeathrate.Remarkably,atconcentrationsof5 μM the other vitamers had no effect on cell viability.In Caco-2 cells, various concentrations of PN had no effect on cell viability, suggesting that PN is specifically toxic to neurons (16).The lack of increased toxicity at higher concentrations o fP Nc a nb ee x p l a i n e db yt h ef a c tt h a tS H - S Y 5 Yc e l l sa r e observed to have variable PNPO activity.PNPO activity s t a t u sm a yh a v ea ni m p a c to nc e l lp r o l i f e r a t i o n ,w h e r e s o m eP N P O - p o s i t i v ev a r i a n t sw e r eo b s e rv e dt od i v i d em o r e slowly.UsingaculturemediumsupplementedwithPNcouldselect against PNPO-negative cells ( 83).The study design by Vrolijk et al.
( 16) used the DMEM medium, which contains mostly PL, and would have failed to select againstPNPO negative variants. Even with higher concentrations, PN failed to increase the cell death rate over 30%.This may be because PN supplementation induced cell death inPNPO-negative variants, and selected for PNPO-positive cells, which may be then resistant to higher concentrations of PN.Possibly, cell death rates would have been higherwhen only PNPO-negative cells would have been selected.In general, cell culture experiments may not adequately model the underlying conditions necessary for PN-inducedneur o pa th y .Th us,theeff ectso bserv edinra tsinvi v oa r ethe morereliable indicators.The neurotoxicity of PN at low-dose chronic exposure is difficult to reconcile with the pharmacokinetics of PN, as it is normally rapidly eliminated ( 24,84,85).
This implies that either brief intervals of exposure to PN are toxic to sensory neurons over the long term or that PN can accumulate following daily supplementation. The firstcase is unlikely considering that peripheral neurons readily regenerateandhaveahighcapacityforrecoveryfrominjury.Daily supplementation with PN over an extended periodcould potentially alter the half-life of PN and lead to its accumulation.IftheaccumulationofPNisnecessarytoelicit neuropathy, then PN-induced neuropathic patients wouldbe expected to have elevated concentrations of PN.At least 1s t u d yf o u n da na s s o c i a t i o nb e t w e e ne l e v a t e dp l a s m aP N concentrations and symptoms of neuropathy.Plasma PNvalues ranged from 140 to 1050 nmol/L.The majority of patients reported daily vitamin use and, as a result, elevated PN plasma concentrations are not necessarily indicativeof PN accumulation.Patients may have consumed PN supplements shortly before blood samples were taken ( 86).

In general, the time course of plasma vitamin B-6 vitamers has not been thoroughly investigated in patients with PN- induced neuropathy.Therefore, it is useful to consider theeffects of daily supplementation on vitamin B-6 vitamer concentrations.EﬀectsofdailyoralpyridoxineonplasmavitaminB-6 vitamerconcentrationsSeveral pharmacokinetic studies that are representative of daily PN supplement use have been conducted and are summarized on Table 1.In general, the pharmacokinetic studies on daily PN supplementation reported consistent results.Edwards et al.( 87) found that PLP concentrations didnotincreasewithhigherdosesandthiswascorroboratedby theotherstudies,wherePLPconcentrationsrangedfrom 300 to 400 nmol/L.
Similarly, 4-PA and PL concentrations werecomparabletoeachotherinallofthestudies.Excludingthe study by Speitling et al. ( 85), there was considerable interindividual variation for all of the vitamin B-6 vitamers measured.Significant outliers for 4-PA, PL, and PN were reportedandPNconcentrationswereevenfoundtobenon– normallydistributed.The large interindividual variations in plasma vitamin B- 6vitamerconcentrationswerelikelyrelatedtodifferencesin the timing of blood samples, lack of control in the durationsince the last dose, and differences in the rate at which PN is metabolized.Most studies did not wait longer than 4 h to draw blood samples or did not explicitly control for thetime duration since the last dose.Speitling et al.( 85)f o u n d thattherateatwhichPNwascompletelyeliminatedduringa singledosevariedbetween6and13h.Similarly,intheV rolijket al.(14) study, the maximum concentration for PN after a single dose ranged from 200 to 1687 nmol/L.
At 4 h, PN concentrations could still be significant in individuals withslower PN metabolism, and the measured plasma vitamin B-6 vitamer concentrations would reflect a brief time point duringrapidchangesinthemassbalancesofPNmetabolites. Smalldifferencesinthekineticand/orexpressionparameters o fa l lt h ee n z y m e si n v o l v e di nP Nm e t a b o l i s mc o u l dl e a dto large variations in the metabolic flux of the vitamin B-6 vitamers.Speitlingetal.( 85),theonlystudythatusedfastingblood samples, found that elevated steady-state concentrations were achieved for 4-PA, PLP, and PL and that PN did not accumulate.In comparison to the other studies, this studyreported lower values for 4-PA and PL relative to the dose administered and found that PLP had the highest steady- state concentration.The values reported by Speitling etal.are likely more representative of exposure levels from daily PN supplementation because they are less dependent on the timing of blood samples.
The collection of fastingsamples would likely significantly lower interindividual variation. The findings by Vrolijk et al.( 14)d o ,h o w e v e r ,s u g g e s t that, in some individuals, the clearance of PN and PL is delayed following daily PN administration.Three of the 6 individuals studied had increased PN concentrations atd a y s3a n d7 .I n1i n d i v i d u a l ,t h eP Nc o n c e n t r a t i o nr e a c h e d 1023 nmol/L at day 7.This likely cannot be attributedto the lack of control in the timing of blood samples considering that, in the same volunteer, plasma concentrations for PN following a single dose fell to 211 nmol/L after 90 min.All of the volunteers with elevated PN concentrations at day 7 had concurrently high concentrations of PL.In 1 volunteer, days 3 and 7 PL concentrations exceeded themaximum concentration achieved during the single dose.Due to the lack of control in the time duration between dosingandsamplecollection,itisdifficulttoclearlyevaluatethese results.
However, these findings indicate that, in some individuals, daily PN supplementation may extend the half- lifeofPN. The delay in PL/PN elimination and increases in their peak concentration following daily PN administration was likelyrelatedtosaturationofPDXKorPNPO .I tisunclearif,in these individuals, the delay in PL/PN elimination would reach a new equilibrium or if the plasma time course of PL/PN would steadily increase.The study by Bor et al.( 88) found that vitamin B-6 vitamer concentrations remained consistent over 84 d, which suggests that, under normal Mechanismofpyridoxinetoxicity 1917 dosing conditions, the delay in PL/PN elimination is not significant.There is insufficient evidence to suggest thathigh PN plasma concentrations are maintained throughout the day following daily PN supplementation.However, over more extended time periods of administration and higher dosesthismaychange.
The possibility remains that, under toxic dosing con- ditions, the steady-state concentration for the vitamin B-6 vitamersisaltered.Throughfeedbackinhibitionandenzyme saturation, supraphysiological concentrations of PN and itsmetabolites could lead to gradual decreases in the activities o fe n z y m e si n v o l v e di nP Nm e t a b o l i s m .B o t hP D X Ka n d PNPOwer esho wntobeinhib i tedb ytheirp r od uctPLP( 89, 90). Gradual decreases in the activities of enzymes involved in PN metabolism could steadily delay the elimination of P Nu n t i le l e v a t e dP Nc o n c e n t r a t i o n sa r er e t a i n e du pt ot h enext dose.Additionally, enzymatic reduction in PL/PLP to PN/PNP by aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) may similarly lead toPNaccumulation( 28).
Mechanismsfortoxicity When considering mechanisms in toxic neuropathies, it is often difficult to identify a specific primary event orm o l e c u l a rt a r g e tt h a tc a na c c o u n tf o ra l lo ft h eo b s e r v e d neuropathological changes. Histopathological analysis may notbeinformativeasmanyoftheobservedchangesarelikelysecondary to an initial causal event.For most peripheral neurotoxicants, several plausible mechanisms exist that are not necessarily mutually exclusive ( 80).In the case of PN- induced neuropathy, observations in PN pharmacokinet- ics, vitamin B-6 vitamer toxicological testing, and tissuespecificity of PN toxicity may be helpful in assessing the plausibility of the existing interpretations.Previously proposed mechanisms include the formation of reactivequinonemethide,aldehydetoxicitythroughelevatedPL/PLP concentrations, inhibition of PLP-dependent enzymes, and PDXKinhibition( 4,16–19).AldehydetoxicitybyPLP.
As a highly reactive electrophile, the 4′aldehyde of PLP is attractive as a possible toxicological agent. The aldehydeof PL is less relevant as it is present almost entirely in its hemiacetal form at neutral pH ( 91).Many electrophilic compounds are neurotoxic.Electrophiles can form covalentadducts with macromolecules that impair the functional activity of enzymes, cytoskeleton proteins, and DNA, and induce cytotoxicity.In fact, the potential of an electrophile to form adducts with biomolecules is highly predictive of its neurotoxicity ( 92).However, there are several cellular mechanisms that prevent the buildup of PLP.Pharmacoki- netic studies have shown that plasma PLP concentrations are independent of the PN dose and likely depend onprotein-binding availability.The maximum plasma PLP concentrations are already achieved by relatively low daily PN doses, generally regarded as safe.Considering that PNtoxicity is dose dependent, PN is the more likely candidate.
Moreover, injections with high doses of PLP in rats failedto induce the morphological changes associated with PN- inducedneuropathy( 82). Quinonemethide-typeintermediates.Due to their highly electrophilic reactivity and capacity to alkylate biomolecules, quinone methides could plausiblylead to the toxicological effects seen with PN toxicity.The formation of reactive quinone methide-type intermediates has been demonstrated following the irradiation of PN in aqueous solution at neutral pH ( 93).Previous studies haveproposedthatquinonemethide-typeintermediatesmayalso form in vivo through interactions with an enzyme (94).However, this has not been thoroughly investigated.Moreover, quinone methide-type intermediates would beexpected to have more broad toxicological activity and not specifically target neurons.The formation of quinone methide-type intermediates may explain PN phototoxic-ity and symptoms related to dermatitis and xeroderma pigmentosum.
In fact, cells from PN-induced xeroderma pigmentosum patients showed similar survival curves asfibroblasts treated with irradiated PN ( 95). Unless there is a specific biological process within sensory neurons that generates quinone methide-type intermediates, it is unlikelythatquinonemethide-typemoleculesareresponsibleforPN neurotoxicity.Inhibition of PLP-dependent enzymes.TheclinicalpresentationofPNtoxicitysharesafewsimilar-ities with a vitamin B-6 deficiency.Both are associated with symptoms related to dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy.Multipleauthorshaveproposedthatelevatedconcentrations ofPNcouldparadoxicallyleadtoavitaminB-6deficiencybycompetitivelyinhibitingPLP( 16,17).Vrolijketal.( 16)found that PN inhibited the PLP-dependent enzymes tyrosine decarboxylaseandalaninetransaminaseby65%and40%,re-spectively.Additionally,Speitlingetal.( 85)foundthatblood aspartate aminotransferase was most strongly inhibited at peak PN plasma concentrations.
The mechanism by whichPN inhibits PLP-dependent enzymes has not been clarified. PLP-dependentenzymesbindtoPLPthroughtheformation of a Schiff base with lysine residues of the protein and thealdehyde at the 4 ′position of PLP.PN lacks an aldehyde, and as a result cannot directly occupy the PLP binding site.PNcan,however,formcoordinationcomplexeswithPL/PLP,amino acids, and metal ions.These coordination complexes could plausibly inhibit PLP-dependent enzymes ( 96).The s t u d yb yV r o l i j ke ta l .( 16) did not determine the kinetic rate constants for PN inhibition, and it is unknown to what extentinhibitionofPLP-dependentenzymeswouldoccuratphysiologicallyrelevantconcentrations.However, there are several indications that vitamin B- 6 function is retained following high doses of PN.Thetryptophanloadtest,asensitiveindexforvitaminB-6status, found no differences between rats receiving PN doses of 1400 mg ·kg −1·d−1over 6 wk and controls ( 97).
Moreover, a vitamin B-6 deficiency leads to several symptoms that are n o to b s e r v e di nP Nt o x i c i t y .T h em o s tc o m m o ns y m p t o m s 1918 HadtsteinandVrolijk in humans include anemia, seborrheic dermatitis, glossitis, electroencephalographicabnormalities,depressionandcon-fusion, neutropenia, and weakened immune function. In experimental animal models, a vitamin B-6 deficiency induced similar changes, including a lowered growth rate, seborrheic dermatitis, acrodynia, convulsions, neurodegen- eration in the brain, weakened immune function, anemia,atherosclerosis, weakness, lethargy, paralysis, alterations in tryptophan and alanine metabolism, and elevations in uri- nary creatinine and xanthurenic acid ( 39,98).These effects have been observed in monkeys, rabbits, chickens, dogs, rats, and pigs ( 99–103).
If the inhibition of PLP-dependent enzymes were responsible for toxicity, one would expectmoresystemiceffects.Eveninanimalmodelsreceivinghigh doses, PN toxicity preferentially targets sensory neurons, andsymptomspossiblyrelatedtoasystemicPLP-dependentenzyme inhibition, such as anemia, are not observed. While symptomsofdermatitishavebeenreportedwithPNtoxicity, there is evidence that this is related to a phototoxic reactioninvolving the formation of quinone methide-type interme- diates (95,104,105), although the possibility of disrupted vitaminB-6functioncannotbedismissed.In animal models of dietary vitamin B-6 deficiency, symptoms related to peripheral neuropathy are uncommonbut have been observed in pigs and rats ( 106,107).A vitamin B-6 deficiency in pigs led to the development of an ataxic gait and degeneration of sensory nerve fibers ( 106).Rats developed abnormal walking patterns and neuronal degeneration in the tibial nerve.
Morphometric analysis characterized the lesion as a myelinopathy. There was asignificant decrease in the mean myelin-axon ratio, while changes in the mean axon or nerve fiber diameter were not observed.This is distinct from the morphological changesassociated with PN toxicity in rats, characterized as an axonopathy with significant increases in the mean myelin- axonratio( 65,107).In humans, there is insufficient evidence to support a linkbetweenadietaryvitaminB-6deficiencyandperipheral n e u r o p a t h y .T h e r ea r eaf e wi s o l a t e dc a s er e p o r t s ,b u tt h e s e were likely related to other underlying health conditions (107,107).
Previously, it was suggested that demyelinating peripheral neuropathy in elderly patients on chronic peri- toneal dialysis may have been caused by a vitamin B-6 deficiency( 108).However,peripheralneuropathyinpatients on dialysis has also been attributed to uremic intoxication, hormonal imbalances, disruptions in ion concentration gradients, and/or other vitamin deficiencies ( 108–112). In rhesusmonkeys,theanimalmodelmostrelevanttohumans, a vitamin B-6 deficiency did not induce neuropathy ( 99, 113,114).Most of the evidence in favor of an association between vitamin B-6 deficiency and neuropathy in humans is related to pharmaceutical interventions ( 115).In a study involving the administration of the vitamin B-6 antagonistand PDXK inhibitor 4-deoxypyridoxine, 3 out of 50 peo- ple complained of sensory symptoms.The most common symptomsincluded nausea,listlessness, lethargy, dermatitis,cheilosis and conjunctivitis, glossitis, and anemia.
Beyondpatient complaints, evidence for peripheral neuropathy was not further investigated ( 116). There are no reports of neuropathy in animals exposed to 4-deoxypyridoxine and it primarily caused dermatitis, anemia, and seizures ( 117, 118).TheantituberculosisdrugisoniaziddepletesvitaminB- 6 and induces peripheral neuropathy at conventional doses and seizures from overdose in humans.Additional adversereactionsincludehepatitis,dermatitis,fever,angiitis,anemia, autonomic neuropathy, and optic atrophy ( 119).Isoniazid disrupts vitamin B-6 activity by forming hydrazine com-plexesthatinactivatePL/PLP.ThesecomplexesinhibitPDXK a n dl e a dt or e d u c t i o n si nP L Pf o r m a t i o n( 120).PN supple- m e n t a t i o ni se ff e c t i v ei np r e v e n t i n ga n dt r e a t i n gs y m p t o m srelatedtoneuropathy,seizures,dermatitis,andanemia( 121).
Morphometric analysis determined that isoniazid-induced neuropathy in rats was characterized as an axonopathy anddistinct from the myelinopathy associated with a vitamin B-6 deficiency ( 107,122–124). While isoniazid-induced neuropathy is responsive to vitamin B-6 supplementation, itmay not be directly caused by a vitamin B-6 deficiency and couldberelatedtoPDXKinhibition.PDXKinhibition.W h i l eo n ew o u l de x p e c tm o r es y s t e m i ce ff e c t s ,aP D X K mutation leads to the preferential injury of sensory neurons w i t hs i m i l a rs y m p t o m sa sw i t hP N - i n d u c e dn e u r o p a t h y .A PDXK mutation causes progressive, length-dependent,sensorimotor, predominantly axonal neuropathy with late- onset optic atrophy.Kinetic studies of the recombinant mutant enzyme found significant changes in the maximal rate(Vmax)andtheMichaelis-Mentenconstant(Km)(Wild type: Km =53.4μmol/L, Vmax =16.8 pmol/h; mutant: Km=174.4 μmol/L, Vmax =6.3 pmol/h).

Clinical symptoms, such as gait or neuropathic pain, improveduponsupplementationwithPLP;however,electro- physiologicalstudiesfoundnoprogressionevenafter18mo(47).Several inherited genetic disorders related to vitamin B- 6m e t a b o l i s ma r ek n o w nt oc a u s en e u r o l o g i c a ls y m p t o m s .Inborn errors in PNPO, ALPL, PLPBP, and ALDH7A1 are linkedtoearly-onsetvitaminB-6-dependentepilepsy,which is thought to be related to disruptions in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission ( 40–45).The mechanism linking PDXK deficiency to neuropathy is, however, unknown ( 47).Compounds that inhibit PDXK lead to convulsions and were shown to inhibit GABA biosynthesis and GABAergic neurotransmission( 125,126).Thus,thereisreasontobelieve thatPDXK-inducedneuropathymayalsobelinkedtoGABA metabolism.
The absence of central nervous system (CNS)- related symptoms in PDXK deficiency could be due totissue-specific differences in the regulation of PDXK gene expression and activity levels. Interestingly, a vitamin B- 6 deficiency in rats led to significant reductions in PDXKactivity within the peripheries, while in the brain decreases were not as marked ( 127).

The neurological effects of PDXK inhibitors appear to b er e l a t e dt oC N Sb i o a v a i l a b i l i t y .A tp h y s i o l o g i c a l l yr e l e v a n t concentrations, the 3 most potent PDXK inhibitors areginkgotoxin, isoniazid, and theophylline ( 120,128). Both ginkgotoxin and theophylline have a relatively high blood– brain barrier permeability and are primarily associatedwith CNS disturbances ( 129,130).In contrast, isoniazid is associated with peripheral neuropathy at therapeutic doses and CNS disturbances at high doses.Log- Pvalues determinedforisoniazid( −0.64),ginkgotoxin( −0.229),and theophylline( −0.02)indicatethatisoniazidislesslipophilic andlikelyhaslowerCNSpermeability( 128,131,132).PN has a higher affinity toward PDXK compared with its othersubstratesandmayactasacompetitiveinhibitorofthe enzyme’s capacity to convert PL to PLP ( 128).
The degree of PDXKinhibitiondependsontheratioofPLtoPN( Figure 2) (133).Log- PvaluesdeterminedforPN( −1.10)indicatethat PN is relatively impermeable across the blood–brain barrier (134). In rats fed high doses of PN, concentrations in the brain were indeed not increased significantly ( 97).In dogs fed 200mg PN ·kg −1·d−1, PN concentrations were slightly elevatedinsome,butnotall,brainsamples( 63).Thus,PDXKinhibition by PN would likely be confined to the peripheries aswithaPDXKdeficiency.However, there is an important difference between PN toxicity and conditions of PDXK deficiency or inhibition.Both PDXK deficiency and isoniazid-induced neuropathywere responsive to vitamin B-6 treatment.Similarly, con- vulsions from ginkgotoxin coincided with an acute decrease in PLP concentrations ( 135,136).This suggests that the neurotoxic effect of reduced PDXK activity is contingent on PLP depletion.High doses of PN are associated with sig- nificant elevations in plasma PLP concentrations.
Moreover,PN toxicity is not associated with a systemic vitamin B-6 deficiency.Thus,PLPislikelybioavailableinmosttissues. There is evidence for large variation in the relative concentrations of vitamin B-6 vitamers across different tissues following high doses of PN.The distributions of vitamin B-6 vitamers in rats receiving 1400mg ·kg −1·d−1 and 7mg ·kg−1·d−1over 6wk are shown in Table 2.Generally,high doses of PN did nothave an impact onPLPconcentrations.Asanexception,PLPconcentrations were significantly elevated in RBCs.
Interestingly, PLP concentrationsdecreased in the gastrocnemius.At all doses,PL concentrations were significantly higher than PN in most of the tissues examined, except for the kidney with 1920 HadtsteinandVrolijk TABLE2 TissuevitaminB-6vitamerconcentrationsinratsfed7mg ·kg−1·d−1and1400mg ·kg−1·d−1for6wk1 PNtreatment, mg ·kg−·d−Tissueconcentration,nmol/gPL-to-PN concentration ratio2 Tissue PLP PMP PL PN PM 4-PA Plasma37 588(41) 6.5(1.3) 685(29) 30.1(4.4) 16.5(1.7) 16.4(6.1) 22.76 1400 634(52) 9.1(0.7)∗4593(269)∗∗∗1375.5(308.33)∗∗∗38.2(2.5)∗∗∗734.6(92.8)∗∗∗3.34 RBCs37 203(10) 104.1(3.3) 939(76) 2.1(2.1) 3.9(2) ND 447.14 1400 947(43)∗∗∗100.6(9.1) 21,502(1186)∗∗∗47.1(47.1) 7(5.2) 13.8(8.7) 456.52 Gastrocnemius47 14.9(1.4) 8.1(0.5) 0.12(0.05) 0.27(0.07) 0.49(0.16) ND 0.44 1400 9.7(0.8)∗∗∗6.9(1.1) 2.47(0.37)∗∗∗2.23(0.77)°0.8(0.32) ND 1.11 Brain 7 7.57(0.4) 11.3(0.5) 1.06(0.33) 0.15(0.05) 0.11(0.04) 0.25(0.1) 7.07 1400 7.32(1.29) 10.2(0.7) 3.81(0.39)∗∗∗0.2(0.07) 0.14(0.02) 0.38(0.16) 19.05 Liver 7 24.5(1.9) 25.1(1.1) 1(0.3) 0.31(0.09) 0.3(0.17) 0.92(0.52) 3.23 1400 24.4(1.7) 23.5(0.8) 2.6(0.5)∗∗0.38(0.08) 0.29(0.14) 0.71(0.37) 6.84 Kidney 7 9.3(1.3) 28.4(0.8) 3.7(0.4) 0.27(0.12) 13.9(0.6) ND 13.7 1400 10(1.0) 28.1(1.9) 13.8(1.9)∗∗∗7.66(2.34)∗∗14.9(1.9) ND 1.8 1DatawereobtainedfromSchaeﬀeretal.( 97).Allvaluesaremeans(SEM), n=5–6,exceptforplasmaandRBCs(SD),forwhich n=11–12.∗,∗∗,∗∗∗Diﬀerentbetweendietgroupswithinatissue:∗P<0.11,∗∗0.01<P<0.05,∗∗∗P<0.01.ND,not detected;PL,pyridoxal;PLP,pyridoxal5′-phosphate;PM,pyridoxamine;PMP,pyridoxamine5′-phosphate;PN,pyridoxine;PNP,pyridoxine5′-phosphate;4-PA,4-pyridoxicacid.

The relative activities of PNPO and PDXK likely play a determining role in the ratio of PL to PN within specific tissues. Additionally, differences in the uptake of PN maycontribute to this.There is evidence that PN uptake is mediated by both passive and facilitated diffusion.PN uptake is a saturable process that may be regulated at thetranscriptional level and may vary between cell types ( 137).Currently, the uptake of PN in cells is not well understood.TissueswithhigheractivityinenzymesthatoxidizePL,suchasaldehydeoxidase(AOX1),orthatreducePL,suchasAKRs, may similarly have a low PL:PN.A specific AKR with PL r e d u c t a s ea c t i v i t yh a sn o tb e e ni d e n t i fi e di nh u m a n s ,b u tapplication of the AKR family 1 member B1 (AKR1B1) and AKRfamily1memberB10(AKR1B10)inhibitorzopolrestat prevented the conversion of PL to PN in mammalian cells.However, genetic deletion of AKR1B1/AKR1B10 did not have an effect on PL reductase activity.
Zopolrestat was alsoshowntoinhibitAKRfamily1memberA1(AKR1A1)( 138). Thus, AKR1A1 may participate in PL reductase activity, although many AKRs have low substrate selectivity, andother AKRs are likely involved ( 28).There is evidence for substantialvariabilityinPLreductionactivitiesbetween cell types.Upon supplementation with PL, the highest secretionof PN was observed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells, followed by Caco2, mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a), and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells.PN secretion rates in HepG2 cells were notably higher than the other cell types ( 35).Presently, both fluxomic data on PN metabolism and data on the relative activities of PNPO,PDXK, AOX1, and AKRs in different tissues are lacking.As a result, it is difficult to assess the contribution of these activitiestotheratioofPLtoPNwithindifferenttissues.
T h e r ea r e ,h o w e v e r ,i n d i c a t i o n st h a tt h et e s t e sm a yh a v e enzyme activity favorable to a low PL:PN since the PDXKRNA expression is highest in the testes, while PNPO expression is comparatively low ( 38).

Additionally, the testes were shown to have a high level of methylglyoxal reduction capacity, anindicatorofnonspecificAKRactivity( 142).Interestingly,PN wasfoundtoinducetesticulardamageinratsatsimilardoses tothosethatexhibitneurotoxicity.Intraperitonealinjectionsof PN in rats led to a delay in spermiation, degeneration of elongated spermatids, and Sertoli cell alterations. Addition- ally,germcellsweredeformed,withmultinucleategermcellsminglingwithanisocytoticgermcells( 143).Similarchanges wereobservedinratstreatedwithisoniazid.Isoniazidledto testiculardamagewithgermcellmalformation,includingtheformationoflargemultinucleategermcells( 144).TherelativeactivitiesofPDXK,PNPO,AKRs,andAOX1 have not been investigated in peripheral nerves.Interest-ingly, there is evidence for elevated activity of AKRs.
The distributionofdiabetescomplicationsisthoughttoberelated to elevated AKR1A1/AKR1B1 expression in the peripheral nerves,ocularlenses,retinas,andkidney( 145).Inperipheral nerves, AKR1A1 is predominantly localized in Schwanncells (146). One purpose of AKRs is to deactivate toxic carbonyl compounds ( 147,148).Considering that neurons are particularly sensitive to aldehydes and DRG neuronshave an incompetent blood–nerve barrier, it is plausible that sensory neurons have a high level of AKR activity.SimilarargumentsareapplicabletoPLoxidaseactivity.WhileinformationontheexpressionoractivityofPNPOislimited, there are indications that PNPO activity may be low within sensoryneurons.PNPOisdevelopmentallyregulatedwithinneurons.In rats, PNPO activity was significantly lower in fetalbraintissuethanfoundinadultbraintissue( 83).Neural stem cells with retentive multipotency were shown to bepreserved in the adult PNS ( 149).
Moreover, Schwann cells have remarkable plasticity and the ability to differentiate intoprogenitor-likestates( 150).Thedifferentiationstatusof these cell types and the general regenerative capacity of the PNS suggest that PNPO activity may be low within sensoryneurons. PN toxicity to sensory neurons: disruption of GABA signaling?Reduced PLP formation by PDXK in sensory neurons demonstrably leads to axonal degeneration.The reason behindthisisunclear;however,thereisreasontobelievethat it may be related to GABA neurotransmission.Compoundsthat inhibit PDXK lead to reductions in GABA biosynthesis and seizures.Moreover, genetic disruptions in vitamin B-6 metabolic enzymes consistently have an impact on GABAactivity.Mutations in PNPO, ALPL, PLPBP, and ALDH7A1 a r ea s s o c i a t e dw i t hc o n v u l s i o n sa n dd e c r e a s e si nG A B A biosynthesis.Mice deficient in PDXP have elevated GABAconcentrations in the brain and mild anxiety-like behavior (29).
Additionally, PN toxicity was enhanced in zebrafishlarvaeexposedtotheepileptogeniccompoundsginkgotoxin, caffeine,andpentylenetetrazol.Noeffectwasobservedwhenginkgotoxin and PN were added to culture medium at the same time. Interestingly, adding PN to the medium pre- treated with ginkgotoxin caused cardiac arrest and necrotic death in a time- and dose-dependent manner.All larvae in the ginkgotoxin control group survived, while 20% diedi nt h eP Nc o n t r o lg r o u p .S i m i l a re ff e c t sw e r eo b s e r v e d usingPNwithcaffeineandpentylenetetrazol.PLPalleviated the convulsions associated with ginkgotoxin treatments.Adding PLP and PN simultaneously prevented PN-induced larvae death ( 151).Thus, it is plausible that PN toxicity may be related to disruptions in GABA activity via PDXKinhibition.
GABA actions are mediated by the ionotropic receptors GABAA/GABAC and the metabotropic receptors GABAB.GABA concentrations are determined by both GABA pro- duction and catabolism involving the PLP-dependent en- zymesglutamatedecarboxylase(GAD)andGABAtransam-inase, respectively. There are 2 isoforms of GAD expressed by different genes.The constitutively active form GAD67 provides the steady basal supply of GABA in the cells, while GAD65 is primarily activated during GABA neurotrans- mission.GAD65 is membrane bound and transiently bindst oP L Pf o l l o w i n gi t sa c t i v a t i o nb yp h o s p h o r y l a t i o n( 152).Interestingly, PDXK has been shown to directly interact with apo-GAD and likely facilitates the transfer of PLP tothe enzyme ( 33).GAD67 is more saturated with PLP.Mice deficient in GAD67 show a lethal development with cleft palate and respiratory defects.In contrast, mice deficientin GAD65 appear normal at birth but are susceptible to seizures ( 153).
As GAD65 exists primarily as the apo- enzyme, it may be more vulnerable to PDXK inhibition(154). GAD65 dysfunction is implicated in epilepsy, stiff personsyndrome,andcerebellarataxia( 155,156).Thereare reports of elevated GAD65 autoantibodies and peripheralneuropathy; however, a causal association cannot be made (157).In the PNS, GABA-mediated presynaptic inhibition of afferent inputs plays a crucial role in signal processing and modulating sensory neurotransmission ( Figure 3).DRG neurons have fully functioning local GABAergic signaling, including transporters, receptors, and metabolic enzymes (158).Additionally, glial cells, including satellite cells and Schwann cells, likely serve as a source of GABA for DRG neurons ( 159–161).Because of differences in chloride- homeostasis, GABAA receptor activation has a depolarizingeffectonDRGneurons.Thisprimaryafferentdepolarization inhibitsthegenerationofactionpotentialsandleadstopresy- naptic inhibition.
In DRG neurons, GABA signaling mayb en o n s y n a p t i ca n dl o c a l i z e di nt h es o m aa n dT - j u n c t i o n . Action potentials generated peripherally enter the soma, thereby activating GAD65 through phosphorylation and,as a result, triggering extracellular GABA release.GABAA receptor activation via paracrine or autocrine signaling of the same or neighboring nerve fibers depolarizes the T-junction.

Mechanismofpyridoxinetoxicity 1923 factor, which results in action potential failure at the T- junction. GABA-mediated presynaptic inhibition has beenobserved in subpopulations of small-, medium-, and large- fiberDRGneurons( 158).The inhibition of GABAergic-mediated presynaptic in- hibition leads to the increased excitability of DRG neurons (158).Genetic disruptions in GABAA receptors in primary nociceptors led to a hyperalgesic phenotype within mice (162).The possibility that local GABA inhibition and/or DRG excitability may cause peripheral neuropathy has notbeeninvestigated.Itisgenerallyknownthatoveractivationof excitatory neurotransmitters leads to neuronal degeneration through excitotoxicity.Excitotoxicity has been shown to in-duceaxonopathywithaWallerian-typedegenerationpattern in the optic nerve and spinal motor neurons ( 163,164).Mostexperimentalstudiesonexcitotoxicityinvolveexcessiveglutamate receptor activation.
Inhibitory neurotransmission contributes to the regulation of neuronal excitability and its inhibition may similarly lead to excitotoxicity. Chronicinfusion with bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, in t h es p i n a lc o r do fr a t sl e dt og a i ta l t e r a t i o n sa n ds i g n i fi c a n t motor neuron degeneration ( 165).Thus, it is plausible that interferencewithGABAneurotransmissioninDRGneurons w o u l dl e a dt oas i m i l a re ff e c t .Figure 2provides a graphical description of the proposed mechanism linking PDXK inhi- bition by PN to GABA inhibition and excitotoxicity.There is evidence that the primary changes associated with PNtoxicity originate at or near the T-junction.Early PN lesions at these sites were characterized by a swollen membranous appearance ( 166).Similar changes were observed in retinal ganglion cells exposed to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (164,167).
Considering that action potentials are generated at the T-junction, it is plausible that this could be relatedto excitotoxicity or neuronal misfiring. Excitotoxicity may, however,notexclusivelyinvolveGABAneurotransmissionas PLP-dependent enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis ofmostneurotransmitters.Impairments in GABA neurotransmission play a pivotal role in the development of neuropathic pain ( 162,168).Following peripheral nerve injury, reductions in GABA activity have been observed in the spinal cord, dorsal horn,andDRGneurons( 169–171).BecausechangesinGABAergic neurotransmission are associated with neuropathy, it is difficult to interpret findings relevant to the role of GABAin PN toxicity.
A study found that the administration of chicory extract, an upregulator of GABAA receptors, amelioratedthesymptomsofPN-inducedneuropathyinrats.Improvements were observed in the hot plate test, rotarod, footfault,andhistologicalanalysis.Conversely,pretreatment with picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist, exacerbatedtheseverityofsymptomsandinhibitedtheprotectiveeffects of chicory extract ( 172). These effects are not unique to PN-inducedneuropathy.Similarfindingswerereportedwithsurgicallyinducedneuropathy( 170,171,173).PDXK inhibition may have deleterious effects on a large number of processes, including energy metabolism,redoxbalance,and/orhormoneactivities.AsPLP-dependentenzymes have a wide range of activity, metabolite analysis may be needed for future investigations.
Compared withother PLP-dependent enzymes, GAD65 may be particu- larly sensitive to PDXK inhibition and decreases in PLP biosynthesis as it exists primarily as the apo-enzyme and bindstoPLPduringneurotransmission.Usingco-expression network analysis, Chelban et al. ( 47)f o u n dt h a tP D X Ki n peripheral nerves was associated with oxidation-reduction processes and suggested that PDXK-induced neuropathy may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction.Xiong et al.(174)identifiedaco-expressionrelationbetweenPDXKand growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43).GAP43 is an axonal membraneproteinthatcontributestoneuronalregeneration,axon pathfinding, growth cone formation, and synapse formation( 175–178).PDXKmaycooperatewithGAP43and itsinhibitionmaydisrupttheseactivities.However,geneco-expression networks typically do not provide information relevanttocausality( 179).Thus,giventheavailableevidence, PN toxicity is most plausibly related to reductions GABAactivityviaGAD65inhibitioninsensoryneurons.
Conclusions In summary, despite the fact that the number of casereports describing neuropathic symptoms in patients takingPN is increasing, the mechanisms behind PN toxicity are not yet known. Previously proposed mechanisms in- c l u d ea l d e h y d et o x i c i t yb yP L P ,t h ef o r m a t i o no fq u i n o n emethide-type intermediates, competitive inhibition of PLP- dependent enzymes, and PDXK inhibition.For several reasons,weconcludethatPDXKinhibitionandconsequently disrupted GABA neurotransmission is the more plausible hypothesis.Genetic deficiencies in PDXK lead to the development of axonalsensoryneuropathy.Theneurotoxiceffectofreduced PDXK activity is contingent on PLP depletion.PN hasa higher affinity toward PDXK compared with its other substrates and likely acts as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme.The degree of PDXK inhibition therefore dependson the ratio of PL to PN.Generally, PL concentrations are much higher than PN in most tissues.
Tissues with comparativelylowPNPOactivityandhighPLreductaseandoxidaseactivityaremorelikelytohavealowPL:PN.Inthese tissues, PLP biosynthesis is likely reduced as with a PDXK deficiency. Thereare,forinstance,indicationsthatthetesteshave low PNPO activity and elevated PL reductase/oxidase activity.The testes are therefore susceptible to PN toxicity.Future investigations are needed to examine the relation between PL:PN and PN toxicity in testicular tissue.There is a paucity of information related to relative gene and proteinexpressioninsensoryneurons;however,thereisevidencefor highAKRactivity.Presently, there is insufficient information to infer a mechanistic link between PDXK inhibition and toxicity.PDXK inhibition likely has a number of pleiotropic effects.Mutations in vitamin B-6 metabolic enzymes consistentlyhave an impact on GABA activity.Additionally, compounds thatinhibitPDXKleadtoreductionsinGABAbiosynthesis.
1924 HadtsteinandVrolijk Therefore, PDXK-induced neuropathy is most likely related to GABA activity. While no direct evidence exists in DRGneurons, GABA inhibition may lead to excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration.More investigations are needed to test the effects of PN, PDXK, and GABA inhibition on sensory neurons.Acknowledgments The authors’ responsibilities were as follows—all authors:performed the study selection and read and approved the finalmanuscript.References 1.Mooney S, Leuendorf J-E, Hendrickson C, Hellmann H.Vitamin B6: a long known compound of surprising complexity.Molecules2009;14:329–51.2 .U e l a n dP M ,U l v i kA ,R i o s - A v i l aL ,M i d t t u nØ ,G r e g o r yJ F .D i r e c t and functional biomarkers of vitamin B6 status.Annu Rev Nutr2015;35:33–70.3.EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA).DietaryreferencevaluesforvitaminB6.EFSAJ2016;14:e04485.4.Salvo ML, di Salvo ML, Contestabile R, Safo MK.
