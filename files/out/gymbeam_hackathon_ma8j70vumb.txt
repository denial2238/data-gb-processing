The results showed that the lower hydro-phobic group and reactive sulfhydryl group of non- pressurized myosin with th e replacement of organic K-lactate or K-citrate possibly contributed to the aggre-gation of myosin molecules compared with the KCl groupand thus decreased the solubili ty of both. In the presence of lactate or citrate, the high-pressure processing caused anincrease in the surface hydrophobicity and reactive sulfhy- dryl group, indicating the unfolding of myosin molecule.Meanwhile, the increased hydration state and the decreasedapparent viscosity suggested the disruption of protein – protein interactions and the strengthening of myosin – water interactions in press urized myosin, ultimately resulting in increased solub ility of the pressurized myosin with both organic potassium salts.The compensation ofhigh-pressure processing is interesting for the ef ﬁcient se- lection of the anion type in developing sodium-reduced in-dustrial meat products.

Usually, a high concentration of sodium chloride ( NaCl )o f2 –3% (0.47 –0.68 mol) is required to solubilize the proteins to achieve the desired functional properties ( Cando et al., 2015).However, there is an urgent need for low-sodium meat products as excessive sodium salt consumptioncan induce hypertension and cardiovascular diseases(WHO, 2013 ).
Therefore, the improvement of myosin solubility under sodium-reduced conditions is of greatsigniﬁcance for the meat industry.Efforts to reduce sodium in processed meat products have been mainly focused on the partial replacement of sodium with other cations ( Horita et al., 2011 ), and much is known about the effects of cations on meat pro-teins ( Zhang et al., 2017a ). However, binding of the negatively charged ions is considered stronger than thepositively charged ones in myo ﬁbrillar proteins (Hamm, 1961; Puolanne and Halonen, 2010 ), and the stability of proteins is dependent primarily on the anion ( Von Hipple and Wong, 1964 ).Recently, anion- induced effects on stability, solubility, and aggregationof proteins were noted ( Yoshizawa et al., 2016 ), and the “salt-in ”effect of the cations could be interfered by the presence of highly hydrated anions ( Wu et al., 2016).However, the role of anions on the solubilization of myo ﬁbrillar proteins has not yet been elucidated.
Various potassium-based salt substitutes have been used in the development of low-salt meat products because of their antihypertensive properties and a much higher rec-ommended maximum intake level ( Tahergorabi et al., 2012). Potassium chloride ( KCl) is the most commonly used salt substitute ( Zhang et al., 2016 ).The organic potas- sium lactate or citrate ( K-lactate orK-citrate ), which is /C2112019 Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-NDlicense ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).Received June 13, 2019.Accepted October 29, 2019.1Corresponding authors: baocaixu@163.com (BX); chencg1629@ hfut.edu.cn (CC) 1717 usually used as antimicrobial agents or saltiness enhancers in meat products, has become an alternative ( Fulladosa et al., 2009; Fellendorf et al., 2016; Sansawat et al., 2019).
These potassium salts also play an important role in preventive nutrition ( Demigne et al., 2004 ). The emerging high-pressure processing ( HPP ) tech- nology can better meet the consumers ’demands for safe and wholesome foods with fewer additives ( Huang et al., 2017 ).Several studies have shown that the solubi- lity of meat proteins can be improved by HPP ( Sikes et al., 2009; Xue et al., 2018 ).However, the solubilizing effect of HPP depends on the system characteristics,such as the ionic strength and the type of salt, leads toa great challenge in the search for the right settings(Fern /C19andez-Mart ín et al., 2002 ).Notably, the interac- tions between protein and solvent are critical indetermining the response of proteins to pressure(Boonyaratanakornkit et al., 2002 ), and HPP can also change the speci ﬁc binding sites for anions ( Speroni et al., 2014 ) and for water ( Grossi et al., 2016; He et al., 2019 ).
A previous study con ﬁrmed that HPP improved the water retention of sodium-reduced chickenbreast gels containing K-lactate or K-citrate ( Zhou et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, a myosin-based perspective study would be potentially useful for meat industry prac-tices.To the author ’s knowledge, there is no literature investigating the impact of HPP on myosin solubility with different anion types of salts.This research work investigated the effect of HPP (200 MPa, 10 min) on the solubility of chicken breastmyosin in sodium-reduced solutions with 3 anion typesof potassium salts (KCl, K-lactate, and K-citrate), whichwould be useful in further understanding the effects ofanion types on HPP-myosin solubility and in providing a new sodium-reduced strategy for meat products.MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Chicken breast meat was purchased from the Carre- four Group, a local supermarket (Hefei, China), andstored at 4 /C14C (within 4 h) until the extraction of myosin.
NaCl, KCl, and K-citrate (K 3C6H6O7$H2O) were pur- chased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.(Shanghai, China). K-lactate (C 3H5KO 3) solution (60%) was purchased from Aladdin Biological Technol- ogy Co., Ltd.(Shanghai, China).All chemicals used were of analytical grade.Myosin Extraction Myosin was extracted from chicken breast as described by Yao et al.(2018) .The ﬁnal obtained solu- tion of protein was diluted with 9 volumes of colddistilled water and settled overnight, and then the pre-cipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 !g for 6 min at 4 /C14C.The protein composition and concen- tration of the precipitate were determined by SDS-PAGE with a gel imaging system (Tanon 2500, TanonScience Equipment Co., Ltd., China) and the Biuret method ( Gornall et al., 1949 ).
Preparation of Myosin Solutions and HPP Treatment The precipitated myosin was diluted in 4 different desired buffers to achieve a ﬁnal concentration of 25 mg/mL and ﬁnal different salt compositions as described in Table 1 . The pH of the 4 buffers was adjusted to 6.0 with dilute HCl or KOH solution (theaddition level had no signi ﬁcant in ﬂuence on the ionic strength) before the dilution of precipitated myosin toexclude the effects of pH changes.All myosin solutions were independently prepared in triplicate.The myosin solution was vac uum-packed in polyethylene bag (approximately 100 mL/bag) before HPP.High-pressure processing was performed in a 0.6-L-capacity,600-MPa high-pressure ve ssel (BaoTou KeFa High- Pressure Technology Co., China), and 200 MPa for10 min was chosen according to the method of Zhang et al.(2017b) andZhou et al.(2018) .A l lt h es a m p l e sw e r e stored at 4 /C14C until further measurements.
Protein Solubility The myosin solutions were diluted with each corre- sponding buffer to 10 mg/mL, followed with centrifuga-tion at 10,000 !gfor 20 min ( Chen et al., 2018 ). The solubility was de ﬁned as a percentage of the protein con- centration in the supernatant relative to the concentra-tion before centrifugation.The measurements wereperformed in triplicate using independently preparedsamples.Surface Hydrophobicity Measurement The surface hydrophobicity was measured using 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid ( ANS)a sd e s c r i b e d byChen et al.(2014) .The myosin solutions were diluted in corresponding buffers to 1 mg/mL.Subsequently,20mL of 15 mmol/L ANS solution (dissolved in 0.1 mol phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was added to 4 mL of thediluted myosin solution and thoroughly stirred.
After20 min at 25 /C14C, the ﬂuorescence was determined with a microplate reader (Varioskan Flash, Thermo Electron Corporation) using an excitation wavelength of 380 nmand an emission wavelength of 470 nm. The surface hydro-phobicity was expressed in ﬂuorescence intensity (arbi- trary units, a.u.).The measurements were performed 6times using independently prepared samples.Reactive and Total Sulfhydryl Groups As described by Guo et al.(2015) , the myosin solu- tions were diluted in corresponding buffers with orwithout 8 mol urea to 1 mg/mL.50 mL of 5,5 0-dithio- bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid ( DTNB ) solution (10 mmol/L in 0.6 mol phosphate buffer, pH 8) was added to 4 mLof each diluted solution and incubated at 25 /C14C forZHOU ET AL.1718 20 min.The amount of sulfhydryl ( SH) content was measured at 412 nm using a molar extinction coef ﬁcient of 13,600 mol21cm21.The measurements were per- formed 6 times using independently prepared samples.
Apparent Viscosity Measurement Myosin solutions (25 mg/mL) were subjected to a 1 mm slit between the plates, the shear rate wasincreased from 1 s 21to 1,000 s21(Fern /C19andez- /C19Avila et al., 2015 ), and the ﬂow curve was obtained by using a rheometer (Discovery HR-3, TA Instruments Co.)with a cone and plate geometry of 40 mm diameterwith 2 /C14cone angle. The measurements were performed in triplicate using independently prepared samples.Hydration Capacity Low- ﬁeld nuclear magnetic resonance ( LF-NMR ) spin –spin relaxation was measured using the method described by Zhou et al.(2018) .The transverse relaxa- tion ( T2) determination was performed with a relaxation delay of 6 s and 16 scans.The top points of 18,000 echoeswere acquired using a tau of 14 msa t3 2 /C14C.The measure- ments were performed in triplicate using independentlyprepared samples.Statistical Analysis All data were analyzed using the General Linear Models procedure in Statistix 8.1 (Analytical Software, St.
Paul, MN). Analysis of variance with Tukey ’s multi- ple comparison was used to measure the signi ﬁcance be- tween different treatments ( P,0.05).RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Solubility As shown in Figure 1 , the solubility of nonpressurized myosin was not varied signi ﬁcantly with the replacement of sodium chloride by KCl ( K1)(P.0.05).The partial replacement of Na1by K1with the same accompanying anion (Cl2) showed a similar solubilizing effect.Howev- er, the partial replacement by K-lactate and K-citrate (K2and K3) resulted in a dramatic decrease in the myosin solubility ( P,0.05) comparing with the control,and the K3 group was slightly higher than the K2 group (P.0.05).These results were mainly attributed to the different anion types because the Na1was replaced by equal molar masses of K1in all the treated groups.
It was suggested that the effects of potassium salts onmyosin solubility strongly depend on the accompanyinganions and that KCl was the most effective substitute inmaintaining the solubility, whereas the organic K- lactate and K-citrate were detrimental to the solubility. The HPP signi ﬁcantly improved the solubility of myosin ( P,0.05) relative to the corresponding nonpres- surized samples, except HK1 ( Figure 1 ).Of interest for this work was the extremely signi ﬁcant improvement of HPP-treated myosin solubility in organic salt groupsof K2 and K3 (the relative increases of solubility were263% and 425%, respectively), and furthermore, the HK3 showed a solubility similar to that of the control (Figure 1 ).The changes in myosin solubility of organic salt groups could be responsible for the water retentionvariation of chicken breast gel in previous studyTable 1.Salt composition of sodium-reduced myosin solutions with or without HPP.

Generally, the degree of protein sol- ubilization in an aqueous medium is the result of electro-static and hydrophobic interactions between protein molecules ( Chantarasuwan et al., 2011 ).High-pressure processing can induce the breakdown of salt bonds andhydrophobic interactions, resulting in unfolding of theprotein ( Cheftel and Culioli, 1997 ) and thus changing the intramolecular and intermolecular noncovalent in-teractions.
The present result was most likely that themyosin with 3 anion types of potassium salts beforeHPP had already induced different molecular interac- tions, leading to different extents of modi ﬁcations of noncovalent interactions during HPP and then contrib-uting to different changes of myosin solubility. These results suggested that HPP could compensate for the NaCl replacement –induced decreases in myosin solubility although the substitution of NaCl by organicpotassium salts was inferior to that by KCl, and thecompensated magnitude depended on the anion type of the potassium salts.Surface Hydrophobicity As shown in Figure 2 , the replacement of NaCl by KCl did not affect ( P.0.05) the surface hydrophobicity of nonpressurized myosin, while the addition of K-lactateand K-citrate induced a signi ﬁcant decrease ( P,0.05).
These results suggested that the NaCl and KCl cause asimilar degree of protein molecular unfolding, and K-lactate and K-citrate cause a relatively lower degree ofprotein molecular unfolding, which were in agreement with the lower solubility ( Figure 1 )o fm y o s i n . The HPP signi ﬁcantly increased the surface hydro- phobicity of 4 groups, and the increases varied withthe anion types ( Figure 2 ).Generally, the hydrophobic groups are previously buried in the interior of the native proteins ( Ikeuchi et al., 1992; Ko et al., 2003 ), and the myosin polymers are bound by their tails to formﬁlamentous aggregates.However, HPP could dissociate the native aggregation that was bound by myosin tailsand simultaneously promote a new type of aggregationthat was bound by the head portion ( Chapleau et al., 2004).
The hydrophobic residues of both the C and K1 groups were exposed to a higher extent before HPP when compared with K2 and K3 groups, which sug- gested that the initially exposed hydrophobic residuescould promote the aggregation of myosin via hydropho-bic interaction during pressurization while the unfoldingof the protein structure occurred simultaneously, andthus, the overall impact on the myosin solubility wasless evident in the C and K1 groups than in the organicsalt groups ( Figure 1 ). The exposure of hydrophobic groups in K3 was more signi ﬁcant than that in K2 during HPP, indicating a greater extent of unfolding of myosinand leading to a higher solubility ( Chantarasuwan et al., 2011).HPP could also improve the hydrophilic ability of proteins via the domination over the simultaneousstrengthening of hydrophobicity ( Xue et al., 2018 ) and thus induced an enhanced solubility.
Reactive and Total SH Groups As shown in Figure 3 A, the effect of KCl on reactive SH content was insigni ﬁcant ( P.0.05), while the K- lactate and the K-citrate induced a signi ﬁcant decrease when compared with the control ( P,0.05), which was consistent with the changes in surface hydrophobic- ity ( Figure 2 ). However, no signi ﬁcant changes (P.0.05) were observed in the total SH content of non- pressurized samples when NaCl was substituted by oneof three salts ( Figure 3 B), indicating that the salt substi- tution did not cause the disruption or formation of disul-ﬁde bonds ( Guo et al., 2015 ).Regardless of the salt substitute incorporation, HPP induced a signi ﬁcant increase in the reactive SH content (P,0.05), indicating exposed SH groups on the surface of the protein and unfolding of the protein structure(Figure 3 A).
Notably, the extent of increase of reactive SH was more obvious in organic salt groups than inC/K1 groups during HPP, possibly due to the intramo-lecular and intermolecular disul ﬁde bonds that formed during the pressurization in C/K1 groups. Furthermore,a signi ﬁcant decrease ( P,0.05) of total SH was found in the C and K1 groups after HPP, whereas no signi ﬁcant effect ( P.0.05) was observed in the K2 and K3 groups (Figure 3 B).The volume-decreasing effect of HPP could shorten the distances of SH groups, facilitating the inter-action between the reactive SH groups, therebyenhancing the formation of intermolecular disul ﬁde bonds through the SH/SS interchange reaction(Cheftel and Culioli, 1997 ), and resulting in decreased total SH contents.
However, the HPP-induced exposure of sulfhydryl groups was dominant over the simulta-neous formation of intermolecular disul ﬁde bonds, whichC HC K1 HK1 K2 HK2 K3 HK350100150200250300Fluorescence intensity (a.u.)

1720 thus increased reactive SH contents in the 4 types of pressurized myosin, especially in the HK2 and HK3groups ( Figure 3 A). These results suggested that HPP could induce a greater extent of unfolding of myosinwith organic salts, hence resulting in a more signi ﬁcant increase of myosin solubility in the K2 and K3 groupsthan K1 groups ( Figure 1 ).Apparent Viscosity As presented in Figure 4 , the viscosity of nonpressur- ized suspensions decreased with increased shear rate,suggesting a shear-thinning or pseudoplastic behaviorof the suspensions ( Song et al., 2013 ).The KCl did not affect the viscosity of the myosin suspension, whereasthe K-lactate and the K-citrate induced much lower vis-cosities at all shear rates comparing with the control.Both the K2 and K3 groups showed extremely low solu- bilities ( Figure 1 ), resulting in a complete separation be- tween the large protein aggregates and the water phaseand then contributing to a low viscosity.
The pressurized sample displayed a much lower viscos- ity than nonpressurized ( Figure 4 ), suggesting that the HPP could present suf ﬁcient energy to disrupt noncovalent interactive forces ( Sikes et al., 2009 )a sh y d r o - phobic interactions ( Figure 2 ) and impair the protein- protein interactions ( Fern /C19andez- /C19Avila et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2017 ). In addition, the present low viscosity is possibly relative to the stronger interactions betweenpressurized myosin and solvent ( Xue et al., 2017 ).Hence, t h eH P Pc o u l dl e a dt oad e c r e a s ei nv i s c o s i t ya n da ni n -crease in the solubility of myosin.Hydration Capacity As shown in Table 2 , the LF-NMR transverse ( T2) relaxation times and the corresponding populations ( P2) were observed in most of the myosin solutions.
Further-more, the relaxation components, T 2b(0.1 –10 ms), T21(10 –100 ms), and T22(100 –1,000 ms), respectively, refer to bound, immobilized, and free water, and the longerrelaxation time indicates more loose bounding of the waterspecies to the macromolecules ( Zhou et al., 2018 ). As far as the salt substitutions were concerned, no obvious changes were observed in T 2andP2between C and K1 groups ( P.0.05), suggesting that the effect of KCl substitution on the hydration capacity was unap- parent.By contrast, longer relaxation times of T2band higher corresponding proportions of this water compo-nent ( P 2b) were observed in K2 and K3 groups when compared with the control ( Table 2 ).The T2bof lower relaxation times ( ,10 ms) is attributed to the water of hydration ( Shao et al., 2016 ).The increase of the T2b 11 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 01E-30.010.1110Viscosity (Pa.s) Shear rate (1/s) C HC K1 HK1 K2 HK2 K3 HK3 Figure 4.

This phenomenon waspossibly resulted from the strong preference of water molecules to hydrate the lactate and citrate anions rather than myosin by donating H-bonds to them, andthus interfering the protein-water interaction, becausethe presence of highly hydrated anions may interferewith the “salt-in ”effect of cations ( Wu et al., 2016 ). After pressurizing at 200 MPa, the C and K1 groups revealed higher T 2bvalues and relative proportions (P2b)(Table 2 ), suggesting that the bound-water became more mobile, but the content of the hydrated water was simultaneously increased.These results werein accordance with the improvement of myosin solubilityin HC and HK1 groups at 200 MPa ( Figure 1 ).Further- more, the T 2bvalues of the HK2 and HK3 groups were less than those of the corresponding unpressurizedgroups, suggesting an increased hydration capacity inthe pressurized myosin colloid solutions with K-lactate and K-citrate.
The HPP-induced volume-decreasing ef- fect can also increase the ionic product [H 1]![OH2] of water, including protein-bound water ( Cheftel and Culioli, 1997 ). And HPP-induced conformational ﬂuctu- ations provide pathways for water to penetrate into theinterior of the native protein, and the water exchange be-tween the protein interior and bulk solvent can beenhanced ( Boonyaratanakornkit et al., 2002 ).These implied that more intermolecular H-bonds were formed between myosin and water, rather than lactate or citrateanions and water after HPP, resulting in increased hy-dration capacity of myosin, and thus reduced theviscosity ( Figure 4 ) and improved the solubility of HK2 and HK3.CONCLUSION The HPP of 200 MPa could compensate for the NaCl replacement –induced decreases in myosin solubility, and this effect depended on the type of anion that accompa-nied the potassium salts.
The lower hydrophobic groupand reactive SH content of nonpressurized myosin with K-lactate or K-citrate possibly contributed to the aggre-gation of myosin molecules compared with the KClgroup and thus decreased solubility. The HPP couldsigniﬁcantly reduce apparent viscosity and increase the surface hydrophobicity, reactive SH, and hydration ca- pacity of myosin with K-lactate and K-citrate, indi- cating the unfolding of myosin with a disruption ofprotein –protein interactions and the strengthening of protein –water interactions and thus improving the solu- bility of myosin with organic K-lactate or K-citrate.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was ﬁnancially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (no.2018YFD0401205)and the Major Science & Technology Program of Anhui,China (no.17030701026).The authors declare no competing ﬁnancial interest.REFERENCES Boonyaratanakornkit, B., C.B.Park, and D.Clark.2002.Pressure effects on intra- and intermolecular interactions within proteins.
