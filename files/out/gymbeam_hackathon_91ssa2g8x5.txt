Magnesium supplementation, metabolic and inﬂammatory markers, and global genomic and proteomic proﬁling: a randomized,double-blind, controlled, crossover trial in overweight individuals 1–3 Sara A Chacko, James Sul, Yiqing Song, Xinmin Li, James LeBlanc, Yuko You, Anthony Butch, and Simin Liu ABSTRACT Background: Dietary magnesium intake has been favorably associ- ated with reduced risk of metabolic outcomes in observational stud- ies; however, few randomized trials have introduced a systems- biology approach to explore molecular mechanisms of pleiotropicmetabolic actions of magnesium supplementation.Objective: We examined the effects of oral magnesium supplemen- tation on metabolic biomarkers and global genomic and proteomicproﬁling in overweight individuals.
Design: We undertook this randomized, crossover, pilot trial in 14 healthy, overweight volunteers [body mass index (in kg/m 2)/C2125] who were randomly assigned to receive magnesium citrate (500 mgelemental Mg/d) or a placebo for 4 wk with a 1-mo washout period. Fasting blood and urine specimens were collected according to standardized protocols.Biochemical assays were conducted onblood specimens.RNA was extracted and subsequently hybridized with the Human Gene ST 1.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).Urine proteomic proﬁling was analyzed with the CM10 ProteinChiparray (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).Results: We observed that magnesium treatment signiﬁcantly de- creased fasting C-peptide concentrations (change: 20.4 ng/mL after magnesium treatment compared with +0.05 ng/mL after placebo treatment; P= 0.004) and appeared to decrease fasting insulin con- centrations (change: 22.2lU/mL after magnesium treatment com- pared with 0.0 lU/mL after placebo treatment; P= 0.25).
No consistent patterns were observed across inﬂammatory biomarkers. Gene expression proﬁling revealed up-regulation of 24 genes and down-regulation of 36 genes including genes related to metabolicand inﬂammatory pathways such as C1q and tumor necrosis factor– related protein 9 ( C1QTNF9 ) and pro-platelet basic protein ( PPBP ).Urine proteomic proﬁling showed signiﬁcant differences in the ex-pression amounts of several peptides and proteins after treatment.Conclusion: Magnesium supplementation for 4 wk in overweight individuals led to distinct changes in gene expression and proteomicproﬁling consistent with favorable effects on several metabolicpathways.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00737815.Am J Clin Nutr 2011;93:463–73.INTRODUCTION Magnesium is an essential mineral in whole grains, leafy green vegetables, legumes, and nuts that acts as a cofactor in hundreds of enzymatic reactions in the human body.
A considerable body of evidence indicates that a higher intake of dietary magnesiummay favorably affect a cluster of metabolic and inﬂammatorydisorders including insulin resistance (1), hypertension (2), dyslipidemia (3), type 2 diabetes (4), metabolic syndrome (5),and cardiovascular disease (6). Inverse cross-sectional and pro- spective associations with intermediate metabolic biomarkers for these disorders, including triglycerides (3), low HDL cholesterol(3), fasting insulin (4), and markers of inﬂammation and endo- thelial dysfunction (7, 8), have also been reported in observa- tional settings.Experimentally, a diet low in magnesium led toimpaired insulin secretion and glucose uptake (9, 10) as well as acute inﬂammation (11) in animal models, and in vitro studies suggested that the balance of extra- and intracellular Mg 2+in pancreatic bcells may be important in the regulation of insulin secretion (12).
However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for the observed metabolic effects of magnesium remain unclear. Because of limited and conﬂicting data from randomized clinical trials (13–17), whether magnesium supplementation can be effective in improving metabolic and inﬂammatory proﬁles in apparently healthy individuals at risk of metabolic abnor-malities remains uncertain.Moreover, none of the few ran- domized studies have applied a systems-biology approach to examine the mechanistic effects of magnesium supplementationon gene expression and protein proﬁling.
Therefore, to com- prehensively investigate potential biological effects of oral magnesium supplementation in relation to metabolic biomarkersand global genomic and proteomic proﬁles, we conducted 1From the Department of Epidemiology (SAC, JS, and YY) and the Pro- gram on Genomics and Nutrition (SAC, YY , and SL), School of PublicHealth, the Center for Metabolic Diseases Prevention (SAC, XL, YY , and SL), the Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine (JS and SL), the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine (XL, JL, and AB),and the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (SL), University of California,Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, and the Division of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Med- ical School, Boston, MA (YS).

Inclusion criteria included being aged 30–70 y and havinga body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2)/C2125, general good health, mobility, and no dietary restrictions or allergies. After an initial screening and run-in period, 14 participants were randomly as- signed to the study treatments ( Figure 1 ).Two participants did not complete the crossover portion of the study because of scheduling conﬂicts.All participants were asked to maintain their usual diet and not make any signiﬁcant changes in diet orphysical activity over the course of the study.All participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study.The Ofﬁce for the Protection of Research Subjects at the Uni-versity of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol and all study procedures.
Study procedures We used a randomized crossover design to compare 4 wk oral magnesium supplementation (500 mg elemental Mg in the form of magnesium citrate) with 4 wk placebo intake (inactive pills that were identical in appearance to the magnesium pills). Thecrossover component was added 2 mo into the study to enhancethe study efﬁciency.A 4-wk washout period was included be- tween treatments.Randomization was carried out by using a computer-generated table of random numbers, and participantswere randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment sequences.Treatment capsules were prepared and dispensed by independent pharmacists at the UCLA pharmacy according to the computer-generated randomization list.Participants were instructed to take one capsule twice daily that contained either magnesium (total daily dose: 500 mg elemental Mg) or the placebo for 4 wk.Treatment capsules were identical in appearance and were pre- packaged in bottles by the pharmacists.
Study participants, investigators, and nursing staff were blinded; only the in-dependent pharmacists and study coordinator were aware of thetreatment assignment. Study enrollment and follow-up were conducted between June 2007 and March 2009.At all 4 visits (ie, baseline, postwashout, and 2 posttreatments), participants underwent a clinical examination including a fasting blood collection.A fasting urine collection for proteomics analysis was collected at each posttreatment visit.At the initialscreening visit, standing height was measured with a wall-mounted stadiometer (Holtain Ltd, Pembrokeshire, Wales, United Kingdom).Weights (in kg) of participants were measured in hospital gownswith an electronic scale (Scale-Tronix Inc, White Plains, NY).BMI was calculated as the weight (in kg) divided by height (in m 2).
Participants were instructed to fast for 12 h before visits, refrain from smoking for 1 h before the visit, and perform novigorous physical activity for /C2112 h before the visit. All study procedures were carried out by trained nursing personnel at the UCLA General Clinical Research Center.FIGURE 1.Flow chart of magnesium-trial enrollment and design.464 CHACKO ET AL Outcome measures Primary outcomes for this trial were plasma concentrations of metabolic and inﬂammatory biomarkers.Secondary outcomes were exploratory in nature and included gene and protein ex-pression proﬁles.Two changes in study outcomes were made after the trial commencement: 1) the oral-glucose-tolerance test was discontinued because of the high participant time commit-ment and 2) urine protein measurements were added to enhance the comprehensive biological nature of the study.Biochemical assays Fasting blood samples were collected by venipuncture at all visits according to a standardized protocol.
Insulin and C-peptideconcentrations were measured on an immunoassay analyzer (Immulite 2000; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerﬁeld, IL) by using chemiluminescent immunoassay technology. Para-thyroid hormone concentrations were measured by using elec-trochemiluminescence technology (Elecsys 2010; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).Glycated hemoglobin concen- trations were measured by ion exchange HPLC (Variant II; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).Glucose, magnesium, calcium, and triglyceride concentrations were measured with an Olympus AU5400 automated chemistry analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc,Miami, FL).
Glucose concentrations were measured by using the hexokinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase method; mag- nesium concentrations were measured by using the direct xylidylblue complex method; calcium concentrations were measured byusing the Arsenazo III endpoint method; and triglyceride con- centrations were measured with a series of coupled enzymatic reactions by using lipase, glycerol kinase, and glycerol oxidase.High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor- areceptor 2 (TNF- a), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular celladhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), E-selectin, and leptin concen- trations were measured with enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (hs-CRP: ALPCO, Salem, NH; IL-6, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1,E-selectin, and leptin: R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; TNF- a: Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, CA).
Interassay CVs for each analyte on the basis of quality-control materials that covered a range of concentrations were 3.4–5.3%for insulin, 5.0% for C-peptide, 0.9–2.8% for glycated hemo- globin, 2.1–5.4% for parathyroid hormone, 1.2–1.8% for glucose, 1.2–2.1% for triglycerides, 2.2–4.2% for magnesium, 1.0–2.4%for calcium, 3.5–4.5% for leptin, 11.6–13.8% for hs-CRP, 6.5– 9.6% for IL-6, 8.2–9.7% for TNF- a, 4.4–6.8% for sICAM-1, 5.5–7.8% for sVCAM-1, and 7.3–8.7% for E-selectin. RNA extraction and microarray hybridization The Paxgene blood RNA system (PreAnalytix; Qiagen/BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was used to collect 2.5 mL whole blood for RNA extraction and stabilization and was stored at 220/C176C for future RNA extraction.RNA isolation and puriﬁcation wereperformed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNAconcentrations and the ratio of A 260to A 280were measured with the use of a NanoDrop-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE); the acceptable ratio of A 260to A280was 1.9–2.1. All hybridizations were performed with the Human Gene ST 1.0 array chip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).Brieﬂy, 0.2 lg total RNA/ lL was used to synthesize double-stranded complementary DNA with the Superscript Choice System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).Real-time quantita- tive polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the resultsobtained from oligonucleotide microarrays for 2 genes, ion channel transient receptor potential membrane melastatin 6 (TRPM6 ) and 7 ( TRPM7 ), which may play an essential role in intestinal and renal magnesium absorption.Glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) was used as a reference gene with the Human GAPD (GAPDH) Endogenous Controlassay (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).
Urine surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry Participants were asked to collect 60 mL of their ﬁrst urine void of the day in a sterile plastic container the morning of each posttreatment visit. Samples were kept cool until stored at 280/C176C for future proteomic analyses.Urine samples were thawed on iceand ﬁltered through a 1- lm membrane before dilution into binding buffer for magnetic-bead solid-phase extraction [either C18 reversed phase (10% acetonitrile + 0.1% triﬂuoroaceticacid) or weak cation exchange (0.2 mol ammonium acetate (pH 4) + 0.01% Triton X-100].Beads were washed to remove nonspeciﬁcally bound proteins and extracted with solvent.Ex-tracts were mixed with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ioniza-tion matrix and spotted on 96-well plate targets for high- resolution time-of-ﬂight mass measurement (prOTOF2000; Perkin-Elmer, Waltham MA).
Another aliquot of ﬁltered patienturine was diluted and applied to surface-enhanced laser de- sorption CM10 ProteinChip arrays (Bio-Rad Laboratories; weak cation exchange surface). The arrays were read in a PBS-IIclinear mass spectrometer (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont CA).Statistical analyses Baseline characteristics of participants were reviewed.We log- transformed all skewed variables and calculated geometric means.For all other continuous variables, arithmetic means werepresented.The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon’s exact test and Pear- son’s chi-square test were used to calculate Pvalues for baseline differences between the magnesium and placebo treatments.Wecompared differences in changes in biochemical markers be- tween magnesium and placebo treatments by using generalized linear models (with Proc Mixed in SAS software, version 9.2;SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and the Wilcoxon’s signed rank sumtest.All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute).
Microarray data analyses were performed with the Partek Genomics Suite version 6.5 software (Partek Genomics, St Louis, MO). Post-treatment measurements of RNA were compared for differential expression.Affymetrix CEL ﬁles (Affymetrix) wereimported into the Partek Genomics Suite software (Partek Genomics) by using the default Partek normalization variables.Probe-level data were preprocessed, including background cor-rection, normalization, and summarization, by using robustmultiarray average analysis adjusted for probe sequence and guanine cytosine (GC) content (GC robust multiarray average).Subsequent data normalization was performed across all arraysby using quantile normalization.The background-adjusted, normalized perfect match (PM) values were compiled and summarized (within each probe set by using the median polishMAGNESIUM SUPPLEMENTATION IN A RANDOMIZED TRIAL 465 technique) to generate a single measure of expression.
A list of differentially expressed genes across the magnesium and placebo treatments was generated by using analysis of variance(ANOVA). For comparison analyses, thresholds for selecting signiﬁcant genes were set at a relative fold change .1.2-fold signal intensity, and a statistically statistical difference was set atP,0.05.Cluster analysis was performed on the selected genes, and principal-component analysis was conducted to identify major effects that inﬂuenced the expression values in eachtreatment.ProteinChip Data Manager software (version 2.0; Bio-Rad Laboratories) was used for proteomics analysis to compile all spectra and automatically detect quantiﬁed masspeaks.ANOVA tests were conducted to test for signiﬁcant dif-ferences in protein proﬁles between magnesium and placebo treatments.
Receiver operating characteristic curves and the corresponding area under the curve were generated as a measureof discrimination to determine whether the set of protein peaks identiﬁed by proteomic proﬁling distinguished between mag- nesium and placebo treatments. RESULTS Baseline characteristics of study participants are summarized inTable 1.The mean age of study participants (71% men and 29% women) was 44 y.All participants were overweight orobese with a BMI ranging from 26 to 32.Forty-three percent ofparticipants were classiﬁed as hypomagnesemic (deﬁned as se- rum Mg concentration ,1.6 mEq/L) at baseline.After the washout period, the same proportion of participants exhibitedhypomagnesaemia, and mean serum magnesium concentrations returned to baseline values (data not shown), which suggested that the washout period was successful.
Although we observedsmall differences in several of the biochemical measurements across the magnesium and placebo treatments at baseline, none of these differences were signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level. Metabolic and inﬂammatory biomarkers The effects of magnesium and placebo treatments on meta- bolic and inﬂammatory biomarkers are shown in Table 2 .W e observed improvements in several metabolic biomarkers after magnesium treatment including a decrease in C-peptide con- centrations (change: 20.4 ng/mL after magnesium treatment compared with 0.05 ng/mL after placebo treatment; P= 0.004) and a nonsigniﬁcant decrease in fasting insulin concentrations (change: 22.2lU/mL after magnesium treatment compared with 0.0 lU/mL after placebo treatment; P= 0.25).
There were no consistent patterns across markers of inﬂammation or endo- thelial dysfunction in response to magnesium supplementation, although we did observe a signiﬁcant increase in IL-6 concen-trations after magnesium treatment (0.23 pg/mL after magne- sium treatment compared with 20.37 pg/mL after placebo treatment; P= 0.03).
Differential gene expression We detected a list of 58 differentially regulated genes after 4 wk of magnesium treatment compared with after 4 wk of TABLE 1 Characteristics of overweight participants enrolled in a randomized crossover trial of magnesium supplementation compared with placebo at baseline ( n= 14)1 All ( n= 14) Magnesium ( n= 7) Placebo ( n=7 ) P Demographic characteristics Age (y) 44.4 613.0247.0613.8 41.9 612.7 0.38 BMI (kg/m2) 28.2 61.8 28.3 61.6 28.1 62.2 0.98 Sex (% male) 71 57 86 0.11 Metabolic biomarkers Insulin ( lU/mL) 7.5 65.7 7.6 66.6 7.3 65.0 0.99 C-peptide (ng/mL) 1.9 61.2 2.0 61.4 1.8 61.0 0.92 Hb A 1c(%) 5.5 60.5 5.3 60.4 5.7 60.5 0.07 Parathyroid hormone (pg/mL) 45.6 611.8 43.6 612.8 47.6 611.3 0.51 Fasting glucose (mg/dL) 85.0 67.2 87.4 67.7 82.2 66.0 0.24 Serum magnesium (mEq/L) 1.58 60.12 1.60 60.12 1.57 60.12 0.57 Calcium (mg/dL) 8.2 (6.7, 9.9)39.2 (9.0, 9.3) 7.3 (4.8, 11.1) 0.32 Leptin (pg/mL) 9222 (6710, 12,675) 11,844 (6795, 20,642) 7442 (476, 11,358) 0.31Triglycerides (mg/dL) 108.6 (87.2, 135.2) 104.1 (64.5, 168.0) 113.3 (94.0, 136.7) 0.42 Inﬂammatory markers hs-CRP (mg/L) 1.30 (0.84, 2.00) 0.97 (0.49, 1.91) 1.67 (0.87, 3.22) 0.31IL-6 (pg/mL) 1.63 (1.19, 2.24) 1.23 (0.67, 2.28) 2.07 (1.47, 2.92) 0.18 TNF- a(pg/mL) 11.2 (9.4, 13.5) 11.0 (7.1, 17.2) 11.4 (10.0, 13.0) 0.51 sICAM-1 (ng/mL) 136.6 (116.4, 160.3) 130.8 (99.8, 171.3) 141.8 (110.3, 182.2) 0.73sVCAM-1 (ng/mL) 434.4 (362.8, 520.0) 485.5 (379.9, 620.5) 394.8 (292.2, 533.5) 0.45E-selectin (ng/mL) 34.1 (29.1, 40.1) 30.7 (24.0, 39.4) 37.3 (29.1, 47.8) 0.45 1Hb A 1c, glycated hemoglobin; hs-CRP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; IL-6, interleukin-6; TNF- a, tumor ne- crosis factor- a; sICAM-1, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1; sVCAM-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.

Several genes closely linked to metabolic and inﬂammatory pathways were down- regulated, including C1q and tumor necrosis factor relatedprotein 9 ( C1QTNF9 ), which is a gene that encodes a glyco- protein secreted by the adipose tissue that plays a role in insulin and glucose metabolism, and pro-platelet basic protein [che-mokine (C-X-C) motif] ligand ( PPBP ), which is a platelet- derived growth factor that belongs to the CXC chemokine family involved in the activation of neutrophils. Analyses of clusters and principal components identiﬁed 2 distinct expression patterns for this set of 58 genes in response to magnesium treatment compared with in response to placebotreatment, which suggested that individuals within each treatmentexhibited similar global expression proﬁles ( Figure 2 ).
On the basis of preliminary differences identiﬁed in the microarray analyses and our prior work (18) that suggested a possible in-teraction between dietary magnesium intake and TRPM6 and TRPM7 genes, we further examined the expression amounts of TRPM6 andTRPM7 by using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction and showed that both genes were up-regulated after magnesium treatment compared with after placebo treatment (average: ’1.4 fold differences) ( Figure 3 ). Differential protein expression Findings from surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry analyses suggest clear differ- ences in the protein expression proﬁles of urine collected from participants after 4 wk of magnesium supplementation comparedwith after 4 wk of placebo treatment.
As shown in Figure 4 , proteins of low molecular weights that ranged from 2311 Da to22.0 kDa were expressed at signiﬁcantly different relative in-tensities after 4 wk of magnesium treatment compared with after 4 wk of placebo treatment. A visible separation in the relative expression intensity of proteins of similar molecular weightswas seen across treatments, which indicated that the discrimi- nation between urine protein proﬁles across magnesium and placebo treatments was high.The area under the receiver op-erating characteristic curve ranged from 0.90 to 0.95 and pro- vided further indication that unique proteomic signatures differentiated between magnesium and placebo treatments.DISCUSSION In this randomized crossover trial in overweight individuals, magnesium supplementation for 4 wk signiﬁcantly decreased fasting concentrations of C-peptide and appeared to decrease fasting insulin concentrations.
We also observed the down-regulation of genes related to metabolic and inﬂammatory pathways including C1QTNF9 and PPBP . Urine proteomic proﬁling showed a number of peptides and proteins signiﬁcantlydifferentially expressed in response to magnesium treatment.These ﬁndings lend support to the hypothesis that dietary magnesium plays a beneﬁcial role in the regulation of insulin andglucose homeostasis.Some (13–15) but not all (16, 17) ran-domized trials indicated that magnesium supplementation can improve dyslipidemia and lower fasting insulin and glucose concentrations.

The list of differentially expressed genes was generated by using ANOV A.MAGNESIUM SUPPLEMENTATION IN A RANDOMIZED TRIAL 469 no effects on total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or triglyceride concentrations (19). In the current trial, C-peptide concentra- tions decreased signiﬁcantly after magnesium treatment, which suggested a reduction in pancreatic insulin secretion that mayhave resulted from an improvement in insulin sensitivity and a subsequent lowered demand on the pancreas.We also observed a biologically consistent, although nonsigniﬁcant, decrease in fast- ing insulin concentrations after magnesium treatment.Decreased FIGURE 2.A: Gene expression patterns for 58 genes differentially regulated after magnesium ( n= 13) and placebo ( n= 13) treatments with the Affymetrix microarray (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).Each row represents one study participant, and differentially expressed genes are shown in columns.
B: Pr incipal components (PC) analysis, which revealed similar gene expression proﬁles within each treatment of 58 differentially expressed genes. Cluster and P C analyses were performed on the list of differentially expressed genes generated by using ANOV A.470 CHACKO ET AL intracellular Mg2+concentrations have been associated with impairment in insulin action and glucose uptake in insulin- sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle tissue (20), heartmuscles (21), and adipocytes (22), and several metabolic studiessuggest that magnesium supplementation could improve insulin- induced glucose uptake (13, 14).In vitro studies also suggested that the balance of extra- and intracellular Mg 2+in pancreatic b cells may be important in regulating the secretion of insulin directly (12, 23).
In contrast to observational studies that linked higher dietary magnesium intakes to lower concentrations of biomarkers of systemic inﬂammation (8, 24), we observed a signiﬁcant increase in IL-6 concentrations after magnesium treatment. IL-6 isa proinﬂammatory cytokine secreted by macrophages and T cells and is the major mediator of the acute-phase response (25).Because elevated IL-6 concentrations may provide an early in-dicator of acute inﬂammation, the observed increase in IL-6concentrations may reﬂect a variation because of unmeasured underlying acute infection disproportionately present in the magnesium treatment by chance, although we do not haverecorded measurements of transitory illness to conﬁrm this ex- planation.Very few randomized trials have examined the effects of magnesium supplementation on systemic inﬂammation inoverweight individuals (24), and our ﬁndings suggest a need for further investigation in larger trials.
Changes in the expression of several genes consistent with metabolic and inﬂammatory pathways were detected. C1QTNF9 , a gene that may play a role in insulin and glucose metabolism, FIGURE 3.Real-time polymerase chain reaction conﬁrmation of microarray results for TRPM6 and TRPM7 (n= 9).Mean ( 6SD) fold changes were calculated by comparing the differences in expression across magnesium (MG) and placebo treatments.FIGURE 4.Surface-enhanced laser-desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry protein expression proﬁles from fasting urine samples collecte d after 4 wk of magnesium supplementation ( n= 7–9) compared with after 4 wk of placebo treatment ( n= 4–7).Values shown are the relative intensity of expression of proteins at varying molecular weights.Pvalues were calculated by using one-factor ANOVA.
AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.MAGNESIUM SUPPLEMENTATION IN A RANDOMIZED TRIAL 471 was down-regulated in the magnesium treatment relative to in the placebo treatment. The protein encoded by the C1QTNF9 gene is expressed in the adipose tissue and is a paralog of adi-ponectin (26), a protein hormone with insulin sensitizing and antiinﬂammatory properties.PPBP , a platelet derived growth factor in the CXC chemokine family and a potent chemoattractantand activator of neutrophils (27), was also down-regulated after magnesium treatment.PPBP mRNA has also been shown to be down-regulated by glucocorticoids in monocytes and platelets(27).Thus, further investigation into the mechanism of action of these genes in response to magnesium supplementation is warranted.TRPM6 and TRPM7, 2 members of the “transient receptor potential” family of cation channels, play an essential role in magnesium homeostasis (28–30) and may be important for glucose and insulin homeostasis.
Coding-region variants recentlyidentiﬁed in the TRPM6 gene may interact with dietary mag- nesium intake in determining the risk of type 2 diabetes (18). Based on this prior work, we investigated the effects of mag-nesium supplementation on TRPM6 and TRPM7 genes and showed that both were differentially up-regulated in the mag- nesium treatment compared with in the placebo treatment at anaverage 1.4-fold change, which supported the theory that thesegenes may interact with dietary magnesium intake and ulti- mately affect metabolic functioning.Although a number of the other genes identiﬁed as differen- tially expressed in this trial are unknown, our exploratory ﬁndings indicated a systemic effect of magnesium supplementation at the level of gene expression.This is consistent with our ﬁndings thatshowed a distinct protein proﬁle in urine collected after treatment with magnesium compared with after treatment with the placebo.
In healthy individuals, 70% of the urinary proteome originatesfrom the kidney and urinary tract, and 30% represents plasma proteins ﬁltered by the glomerulus (31). We conducted this ex- ploratory analysis of the urinary proteome to investigate the waymagnesium might affect the expression of systemic and renalproteins related to metabolic and inﬂammatory disease.Our ﬁndings were suggestive of measurable physiologic changes in the urinary proteome after treatment with magnesium for 4 wk,which warrants further investigation into these changes and identiﬁcation of the proteins involved.Several limitations need to be kept in mind when interpreting ﬁndings of this trial.First, the small size and short time frame limited our power in detecting changes because of the magnesium treatment.
Second, we made an explicit assumption that awashout period of 4 wk was adequate in clearing the system of magnesium, which was a reasonable assumption because of the moderately low dose of magnesium administered in the study.Third, magnesium citrate was administered in our study becauseof its superior bioavailability over other formulations (32), but the inclusion of citrate may have led to systemic changes in the acid- base balance that may have been partially responsible for thedifferential regulation of the organic anion transporter LST-3b as well as changes in urine protein proﬁles.
Our microarray and proteomics analyses were exploratory in nature and limited withrespect to the speciﬁcity of pathways and proteins identiﬁed; however, our ﬁndings provide evidence to support the effects of short-term magnesium supplementation on global gene expres-sion and proteomic proﬁling consistent with metabolic pathways.Finally, an inherent limitation of our systems biology approachcombined with the small size of the trial was that not all po- tentially important ﬁndings reached statistical signiﬁcance at the conventional a= 0.05 level; however, the scientiﬁc value in stimulating further research in this area is nonetheless present. In conclusion, ﬁndings from this randomized crossover trial indicated that magnesium supplementation for 4 wk may improveinsulin and glucose homeostasis in overweight or obese indi- viduals.Systemic changes in gene and protein expression also provided further leads that should be investigated in future studiesof large populations.
