Abstract: The light weight and high strength of magnesium alloys have garnered significant attention, rendering them suitable for various applications across industries. Nevertheless, to meet industrial requirements, the mechanical properties must be improved.This investigation explores the potential of graphene addition to enhance the mechanical properties of AM60B magnesium alloy.
Tests were conducted on samples with different weight percentages (wt.%) of graphene (0 wt.%, 0.1 wt.%, and 0.2 wt.%) using stir casting. The elongation and tensile strength of the composite materials were also assessed.The phase composition, particle size, and agglomeration phenomena were analyzed using characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, and SEM- EDS.The yield strength of the magnesium alloy was enhanced by approximately 13.4% with the incorporation of 0.1 wt.% graphene compared to the alloy without graphene.Additionally, an 8.8% increase in elongation was observed.However, the alloy tensile properties were reduced by adding 0.2 wt.% graphene.The tensile fractography results indicated a higher probability of brittle fracture with 0.2 wt.% graphene.Furthermore, regression analysis employing machine learning techniques revealed the potential of predicting the stress–strain curve of composite materials.
Keywords: graphene reinforcement; mechanical properties; regression analysis 1. Introduction Magnesium alloys are known for their light weight and high specific strength and have garnered significant attention for various applications in industries such as automo- tive, aerospace and biomedical [ 1–3].Among these alloys, AM60B stands out due to its favorable mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, making it a popular choice for structural applications.However, to meet the evolving demands of these industries, further enhancement of their mechanical properties is necessary [4].Recent advancements have shown that the incorporation of nano-reinforcements such as graphene can significantly improve the mechanical performance of metal matrix composites (MMCs) [ 5].Graphene, which exhibits exceptional mechanical strength and electrical properties, has emerged as a promising reinforcement material [ 6].
The addition of graphene to magnesium alloys enhances their properties such as yield strength, tensile strength, and ductility [ 7]. However, the optimal concentration of graphene and its inter- action with the matrix material require careful investigation to maximize these benefits without introducing adverse effects like agglomeration [8].The main hypothesis of this study is that small additions of graphene (specifically 0.1 wt.%) can significantly improve the mechanical properties of AM60B magnesium alloy by enhancing dislocation movement and strengthening grain boundaries.However, we expect that at higher concentrations (such as 0.2 wt.% and above), graphene may lead to agglomeration, which would offset the reinforcing benefits and result in a deterioration of the alloy’s mechanical performance.This hypothesis is supported by conflicting results in Materials 2024 ,17, 4673.
https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17184673 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials Materials 2024 ,17, 4673 2 of 22 the literature: some studies suggest that increased graphene content leads to better material properties [ 9], while others have expressed that excess graphene may result in decreased ductility due to its tendency to agglomerate [10]. In this study, the mechanical properties of AM60B alloy with varying graphene con- tents (0 wt.%, 0.1 wt.%, and 0.2 wt.%) were evaluated through yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation measurements.The primary objective was to determine the opti- mal graphene concentration that maximizes mechanical performance without introducing adverse effects like brittleness.Furthermore, this study aims to provide a detailed under- standing of the metallurgical mechanisms underlying the performance differences across these compositions, focusing on how graphene affects dislocation behavior, load transfer mechanisms, and grain boundary interactions.
To achieve these objectives, the study employs a combination of advanced character- ization techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) for phase identification, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for microstructural analysis, and energy-dispersive X-ray spec- troscopy (EDS) to examine the elemental distribution of the composites [ 11,12]. In addition to the experimental analysis, regression modeling was applied to predict the stress–strain behavior of the composites based on the observed microstructural features and mechanical properties [ 13].By integrating experimental data with regression analysis, this study not only investigated the optimal graphene content for strengthening AM60B but also con- tributed to understanding how nano-reinforcements can be effectively utilized in metal matrix composites.2.
Materials and Methods The base material selected for this study was AM60B magnesium alloy, known for its excellent balance of strength, ductility, and corrosion resistance, making it ideal for various structural applications. The material was purchased from Guangyu Technology Co., Ltd.(Shenzhen, China).The chemical composition of AM60B is given in Table 1.Table 2 details the compositions of the alloying elements used, expressed as percentages (wt.%).Table 1.Elemental composition of the matrix material in wt.%.Elements Al Mn Zn Si Fe Cu Ni Mg wt.% 5.800 0.320 0.220 0.100 0.005 0.01 0.002 Bal Table 2.Compositions of the composites used in this study.No.Matrix (AM60B) (wt.%) Reinforcement (Graphene) (wt.%) 1 100 0 2 99.9 0.1 3 99.8 0.2 To further enhance the mechanical properties of AM60B, graphene was selected as the reinforcement material owing to its superior mechanical properties.The graphene reinforcement was purchased from Jiehan Technology Corporation (Taichung, Taiwan), Taiwan.
Composites were prepared with three different graphene contents: 0 wt.% (as a control), 0.1 wt.%, and 0.2 wt.%. This approach was used to investigate the effects of small additions of graphene on the mechanical performance and microstructure of the alloy, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of how graphene influences the material’s overall behavior.The specific weight percentages of graphene (0.1 wt.% and 0.2 wt.%) were selected based on prior research, which indicated that higher graphene content (above 1 wt.%) could negatively affect the material’s properties.Even in earlier studies, small amounts of graphene were reported to have potentially adverse effects on composite behavior [ 14,15].As a result, lower percentages of graphene were chosen to avoid these issues.Small ad- Materials 2024 ,17, 4673 3 of 22 ditions of graphene can significantly enhance mechanical properties, although the effect varies depending on the matrix material.
This study specifically investigates the perfor- mance of the AM60B alloy with these selected concentrations of graphene reinforcement to better understand its effects. The composites were fabricated using the stir casting method.Initially, AM60B magnesium alloy and graphene particles were placed into a steel crucible, which was then gradually heated to 760◦C.A stabilization period of 15 min was maintained at every 100◦C rise to ensure uniform heating.At 400◦C, a protective gas mixture of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) was introduced to prevent the magnesium alloy from igniting [ 16].As the temperature continued to rise to 700◦C, argon gas was utilized to prevent oxidation.Once the temperature reached 760◦C, the melt was mechanically stirred with two blades at 300 rpm for 5 min, ensuring a uniform dispersion of graphene particles within the AM60B alloy.
The molten mixture was then poured into a mold while still in its liquid state and the solidified ingot of the composite was collected from the mold. A schematic of gravity stir casting is presented in Figure 1.No specific method was implemented to prevent the agglomeration of graphene during fabrication.Instead, the stirring speed of 300 rpm was used to disperse the graphene within the matrix.Although this is not a standardized procedure for stirring speed, many researchers have adopted similar stirring speeds when working with composite materials that include reinforcements [ 15,17,18].Graphene exhibits unique properties compared to other reinforcements, and there is limited research on how stirring speed specifically affects its distribution.Thus, the chosen speed of 300 rpm was used to focus on the metallurgical characteristics and mechanical properties produced by this stir casting process.Materials 2024 , 17, 4673 3 of 22 Table 2.

For material characterization, the cast ingots were machined into billets with dimensions of 11 mm × 11 mm × 80 mm. These billets were utilized for various characterization techniques, including X-ray di ﬀraction (XRD), optical microscopy (OM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), to analyze phase composition, grain size, and microstructural features.For mechanical testing, the tensile specimens were machined into a dog-bone shape according to ASTM E8-69 [20].This standard ensures consistent dimensions and geometry of specimens, facilitating accurate and reproducible tensile testing.Dog-bone specimens were prepared to evaluate yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation at break.Figure 2 presents th e specimen preparation used in this study.Figure 1.Stir casting schema used in this study [19].For material characterization, the cast ingots were machined into billets with dimen- sions of 11 mm ×11 mm ×80 mm.

X-ray Di ﬀraction X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) was conducted to determine the phase proportions in the multiphase alloys used in this study, as well as to assess the crystallite size and la ttice strain resulting from the addition of graphe ne reinforcement. Since graphene contains carbon, an initial XRD analysis was performed on the reinforcement material to con ﬁrm its composition.The XRD pa tterns were analyzed using a Bruker D2 PHASER X-ray Diﬀractometer (Bruker Co., Boston, MA, USA) to ensure accuracy in phase identi ﬁcation and crystallographic analysis.Figure 3 shows the XRD pa ttern of graphene, which exhibits a distinct and pronounced double peak.These peaks, occurri ng at 26.6° and 54.79°, correspond to the (004) and (008) planes of the carbon (C) phase, respectively, con ﬁrming the presence of graphene [21].
The crystalline structure of graphene was fu rther validated by the close agreement between these peaks with the 2 θ value typically seen for the (002) plane at approximately 26.5°.

This phenomenon is known as the Hall–Petch mechanism, where smaller grain sizes increase the material’s resistance to dislocation motion, enhancing its strength [24,25].

In this study, the average grain size for all composites was determined using ImageJ® version 1.54k, and the values are shown in Fi gure 8. The grain size distribution was plo tted using a lognormal distribution due to its suitability for representing grain size data, which often exhibit a skewed distributi on [26].This distribution e ﬀectively captures the spread of grain sizes and their frequency.The standard deviation is within an acceptable range, conﬁrming that the lognormal distribution is appropriate for calculating the grain size in this context.It is observed that the average grain si ze decreases for the AM60B alloy reinforced with 0.1 wt.% graphene, indicating e ﬀective grain re ﬁnement and strengthening via the Hall–Petch mechanism.However, for the AM60B alloy with 0.2 wt.% graphene, the grain size increases, potentially leading to a reduction in mechanical performance.
Previous studies have suggested that there may be a decrease in the Hall–Petch slope at extremely ﬁne grain sizes, depending on the alloying elements and microstructural characteristics [27]. The reduction in grain size, particularly at 0.1 wt.% graphene, suggests that Hall– Petch strengthening plays a key role in enha ncing the yield strength of the material.Figure 7.Optical microscopy images of AM60B graphene grains: ( A) x = 0, ( B) x = 0.1, and ( C) x = 0.2.Figure 7.Optical microscopy images of AM60B graphene grains: ( A) x = 0, ( B) x = 0.1, and ( C) x = 0.2.In this study, the average grain size for all composites was determined using ImageJ® version 1.54k, and the values are shown in Figure 8.The grain size distribution was plotted using a lognormal distribution due to its suitability for representing grain size data, which often exhibit a skewed distribution [ 26].This distribution effectively captures the spread of grain sizes and their frequency.
The standard deviation is within an acceptable range, confirming that the lognormal distribution is appropriate for calculating the grain size in this context.

Instead, graphene likel y enhances the material through other strengthening mechanisms, which will be discussed later in the study. To further investigate the material’s microstructure, SE M-EDS analysis was conducted using a JEOL 7900F FE-SEM (Tokyo, Japan).Figure 9 presents the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images for the AM60B/graphene composites with (A) 0 wt.%, (B) 0.1 wt.%, and (C) 0.2 wt.%.These images o ﬀer insights into the elemental distribution and the e ﬀects of non-metallic reinforcement inclusions.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations revealed the presence of secondary Mg 17Al12 intermetallic phases, which are formed with the addition of alloying elements.For the 0.1 wt.% graphene sample, the MgC 2 phase is less likely to form and remains undetectable in XRD analysis (as shown in Figure 4), likely because it is below the detection limit [14].
However, at 0.2 wt.% graphene, there is evidence of carbon agglomeration in speci ﬁc surface areas, which may correspond to MgC 2 formation. The composition of th e agglomerates is further clari ﬁed by the EDS point analysis in Figure 10.50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400012345Standard Deviation = 0.422 μm AM60B-0 wt.% Graphene (A) Count Grain Size (μm)Average Size = 174.4412 μm 50 100 150 200 250 300 350024681012Standard Deviation = 0.443 μm AM60B-0.1 wt.% Graphene (B) Average Size = 131.3948 μm Count Grain Size (μm) 50 100 150 200 250 300 3500123456Standard Deviation = 0.358 μm AM60B-0.2 wt.% Graphene (C) Average Size = 204.5943 μm Count Grain Size (μm) Figure 8.Calculated grain size with the addition of reinforcement AM60B-xGraphene: ( A) x = 0, (B) x = 0.1, and ( C) x = 0.2.
Materials 2024 ,17, 4673 9 of 22 It is observed that the average grain size decreases for the AM60B alloy reinforced with 0.1 wt.% graphene, indicating effective grain refinement and strengthening via the Hall–Petch mechanism. However, for the AM60B alloy with 0.2 wt.% graphene, the grain size increases, potentially leading to a reduction in mechanical performance.Previous studies have suggested that there may be a decrease in the Hall–Petch slope at extremely fine grain sizes, depending on the alloying elements and microstructural characteristics [ 27].The reduction in grain size, particularly at 0.1 wt.% graphene, suggests that Hall–Petch strengthening plays a key role in enhancing the yield strength of the material.3.1.4.SEM-EDS Analysis The fabrication process employed in this study utilized stir casting, where both the matrix and reinforcement materials are melted together.The process temperature was determined based on the matrix material, which was set at 760◦C [28].
Graphene was selected as the reinforcement, composed of carbon—a common element that typically forms interstitial solid solutions due to its smaller atomic size compared to solvent atoms. How- ever, graphene’s unique chemical structure and high melting point, which is higher than that of magnesium alloys, suggest that it may not contribute to solid solution strengthening.Instead, graphene likely enhances the material through other strengthening mechanisms, which will be discussed later in the study.To further investigate the material’s microstruc- ture, SEM-EDS analysis was conducted using a JEOL 7900F FE-SEM (Tokyo, Japan).Figure 9 presents the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images for the AM60B/graphene composites with (A) 0 wt.%, (B) 0.1 wt.%, and (C) 0.2 wt.%.These images offer insights into the elemental distribution and the effects of non-metallic reinforcement inclusions.

For each material composition, three samples were tested, and the resulting tensile curves were averaged and presented in Figure 11.

However, upon the addition of 0.2 wt.% graphene, the yield strength began to decrease by approximately 8.3%, along with reductions in other mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength and strain at break. This decrease may be a ttributed to the higher reinforcement content, which tends to make the metal less ductile compared to that with lower graphene content [31].Figure 11.Tensile stress–strain curve of all samples.Table 6.Comparison of some previous studies with th e result in this study on the mechanical properties of magnesium alloys fabricated using the casting process.

It is important to note that the data in Table 6 are not limited to the specific type of graphene powder used in this study, as there are various forms of graphene that can be used as reinforcements, such as graphene nanosheets, graphene nanoplatelets, and graphene oxide [ 29,30]. Although the types of graphene differ, these comparisons provide useful references for understanding their effects on mechanical properties.As observed in prior studies, the use of graphene oxide and graphene nanoplatelets typically enhances the mechanical properties of composites as the graphene content in- creases.However, with graphene nanosheets, the mechanical properties can vary, some- times decreasing when higher graphene percentages are used.This phenomenon highlights the need for further investigation, including metallography and characterization, to under- stand the underlying mechanisms.
Similarly, in this study, the optimal graphene content for improving mechanical properties was found to exist within a specific range. Beyond this range, increasing the graphene content does not necessarily yield better results and can even have adverse effects.Materials 2024 ,17, 4673 11 of 22 Notably, the yield strength of the composites was highest when 0.1 wt.% graphene was employed, showing an increase of approximately 13.4% compared to the sample without reinforcement.However, upon the addition of 0.2 wt.% graphene, the yield strength began to decrease by approximately 8.3%, along with reductions in other mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength and strain at break.This decrease may be attributed to the higher reinforcement content, which tends to make the metal less ductile compared to that with lower graphene content [31].Table 6.

Microhardness Testing Figure 12A shows that the microhardness of the material slightly increased with the addition of 0.1 wt.% graphene, indicating a marginal improvement in hardness. However, upon further addition of 0.2 wt.% graphene, a noticeable decrease in microhardness is observed.This decline suggests that while a small amount of graphene can enhance hardness, excessive amounts may reduce material strength.The microhardness of the AM60B alloys was measured using a Wilson VH1102/1202 Knoop/Vickers hardness tester.The measurements were conducted with a 300 gf load applied for 10 s using VHPro Express DiaMet VH1102 software to assess the hardness of the material accurately.The grain size of the sample containing 0.2 wt.% graphene is larger compared to the other samples, which typically leads to lower hardness due to the reduced effectiveness of grain boundary strengthening.
Grain boundary strengthening becomes more effective as the grain size decreases because a higher number of grain boundaries hinders dislocation motion, contributing to greater hardness. The observed drop in microhardness may also be attributed to the inhomogeneous distribution of graphene, which could result in areas within the grains that are inadequately reinforced [37].Materials 2024 ,17, 4673 12 of 22 Materials 2024 , 17, 4673 12 of 22 AZ91-0.8GNS 252 ± 5.5 307 ± 5.0 AZ91-1.2GNS 234 ± 3.0 287 ± 5.0 AM60B 101.7 ± 4.9 229.4 ± 4.0 This Study AM60B-0.1 wt.% graphene 115.3 ± 5.6 256.7 ± 3.7 AM60B-0.2 wt.% graphene 93.2 ± 4.1 215.4 ± 5.5 3.2.2.Microhardness Testing Figure 12A shows that the microhardness of the material slightly increased with the addition of 0.1 wt.% graphene, indicating a marginal improvement in hardness.However, upon further addition of 0.2 wt.% graphene , a noticeable decrease in microhardness is observed.

As shown in Figure 12B, the plot of hard ness values against grain size shows a linear relationship. As the grain size decreases, hardne ss increases, which is consistent with the Hall–Petch mechanism, where grain boundary strengthening contributes to improved mechanical properties [38].This relationship arises because the grain boundaries tend to exhibit higher hardness compared to the interi or of the grains, which helps in terms of impeding dislocation movement and improving overall hardness.Figure 12.(A) Microhardnesses of the alloys and composites, ( B) Plot hardness vs.grain size for all the samples.3.3.Regression Analysis Based on Mechanical Testing In this study, a machine learning appr oach was employed to analyze the elastic regions of the stress–strain curves obtained from the tensile tests of AM60B magnesium alloy composites, as illustrated in Figure 13.
Previous studies have explored both experimental mechanics and the application of machine learning to analyze stress–strain curves [38] and optimize material composition [39]. The objective of this study was to use machine learning regression algorithms, speci ﬁcally linear regression, to model the relationship between stress and strain within the elastic region.The elastic region is crucial because it represents the initial linear portion of the stress–strain curve.By accurately modeling this region, regression analysis can o ﬀer Figure 12.(A) Microhardnesses of the alloys and composites, ( B) Plot hardness vs.grain size for all the samples.As shown in Figure 12B, the plot of hardness values against grain size shows a linear relationship.As the grain size decreases, hardness increases, which is consistent with the Hall–Petch mechanism, where grain boundary strengthening contributes to improved mechanical properties [ 38].
This relationship arises because the grain boundaries tend to exhibit higher hardness compared to the interior of the grains, which helps in terms of impeding dislocation movement and improving overall hardness. 3.3.Regression Analysis Based on Mechanical Testing In this study, a machine learning approach was employed to analyze the elastic regions of the stress–strain curves obtained from the tensile tests of AM60B magnesium alloy composites, as illustrated in Figure 13.Previous studies have explored both experimental mechanics and the application of machine learning to analyze stress–strain curves [ 38] and optimize material composition [ 39].The objective of this study was to use machine learning regression algorithms, specifically linear regression, to model the relationship between stress and strain within the elastic region.

The regression model was trained using the full dataset derived from the stress–strain curves of the AM60B magnesium alloy composites.To en sure the model’s validity, this study implemented an 80–20 split of the data, with 80% allocated for training and 20% for validation.This approach allowed us to test the model on unseen data and verify that it did not over ﬁt the training set [40,41].Although hyperparameter tuning is an important step in optimizing machine learning models, including linear regression , its impact can vary depending on the algorithm and dataset [42].In some cases, th e default parameters may yield satisfactory results, and further tuning may provide only marginal gains.
As the current regression analysis performed well within the elastic re gion, extensive hyperparameter optimization was not pursued. The machine learning regression analysis was performed by ﬁtting a linear model to the data points within the elastic region.Th is model allows for the prediction of stress based on strain values, which is fundamental to understanding the mechanical behavior of materials.To evaluate the performanc e of the regression model, various machine learning metrics, such as R-squared (R2) and mean absolute error (MAE), were calculated.These metrics help determine the accuracy and reliability of the model, ensuring that the predictions closely match the experimental da ta.As shown in Figure 14, which presents the regression lines generated for the el astic region, the green regression lines ﬁt well within the elastic region for all three compos itions.
The accuracy and performance of the regression model will be assessed using speci ﬁc machine learning metrics, which will be discussed in detail in the later sections of this study.

These mechanisms, which in ﬂuence the dislocation motion, directly a ﬀect material strength. As the dislocation mobility decreases, the mate rial strength increases [43].Strengthening mechanisms can be categorized into several types, including obstacle strengthening (Orowan), the Hall–Petch e ﬀect, thermal expansion mismatch (CTE), and load transfer strengthening.Each mechanism plays a distinct role in enhancing the mechanical properties of the material [44].Obstacle strengthening, also known as Orowan strengthening, occurs when dislocations encounter obstacles such as precip itates or particles that impede their motion.The interaction between the strain ﬁeld of a dislocation and these obstacles increases the material strength by increasing the energy required for dislocation movement.The length of the dislocation is directly related to th e strain energy introduced into the material, which can be expressed as the elastic energy per unit length.
This energy ( 𝐸 ୄ) is expressed by Equation (5) involving the shear modulus ( µ), the magnitude of the Burgers vector ( b), the radius of in ﬂuence around the dislocation ( R), and the core radius of the dislocation (ro) [45,46]: 𝐸ୄ= 𝜇𝑏ଶ 4𝜋𝑙𝑛𝑅 𝑟௢ (5) From the concept of elastic energy, the re lationship can be further extended to calculate yield strength. Using the Orowan–Ashby equation, it is important to note that some of the symbols in the equation may di ﬀer.In this context, b represents the Burgers vector, Gm is the shear modulus, dp denotes the mean particle size, and Vf refers to the volume fraction, which can be calculated using Equation (6).The symbol λ represents the interparticle distance between graphene particles, which can be determined using Equation (7).Once λ is found, Equation (8) can then be applied to calculate the Orowan strengthening contribution: Figure 14.Regression lines of AM60B-xGraphene: ( A) x = 0, ( B) x = 0.1, and ( C) x = 0.2.4.Discussion 4.1.
Strengthening Mechanism When studying the impact of small reinforcement additions on mechanical properties, it is crucial to consider the various strengthening mechanisms at play. These mechanisms, which influence the dislocation motion, directly affect material strength.As the dislocation mobility decreases, the material strength increases [ 43].Strengthening mechanisms can be categorized into several types, including obstacle strengthening (Orowan), the Hall– Materials 2024 ,17, 4673 14 of 22 Petch effect, thermal expansion mismatch (CTE), and load transfer strengthening.Each mechanism plays a distinct role in enhancing the mechanical properties of the material [ 44].Obstacle strengthening, also known as Orowan strengthening, occurs when disloca- tions encounter obstacles such as precipitates or particles that impede their motion.
The interaction between the strain field of a dislocation and these obstacles increases the mate- rial strength by increasing the energy required for dislocation movement. The length of the dislocation is directly related to the strain energy introduced into the material, which can be expressed as the elastic energy per unit length.This energy ( E⊥)is expressed by Equation (5) involving the shear modulus ( µ), the magnitude of the Burgers vector ( b), the radius of influence around the dislocation ( R), and the core radius of the dislocation (ro) [45,46]: E⊥=µb2 4πlnR ro(5) From the concept of elastic energy, the relationship can be further extended to calculate yield strength.Using the Orowan–Ashby equation, it is important to note that some of the symbols in the equation may differ.In this context, brepresents the Burgers vector, Gmis the shear modulus, dpdenotes the mean particle size, and Vfrefers to the volume fraction, which can be calculated using Equation (6).
The symbol λrepresents the interparticle distance between graphene particles, which can be determined using Equation (7). Once λis found, Equation (8) can then be applied to calculate the Orowan strengthening contribution: Vf=WR×ρR Wm×ρm(6) λ=dp(1 V1/3 f−1) (7) ∆σo=0.13Gmb γlndp 2b (8) Another strengthening mechanism is grain boundary strengthening, known as the Hall–Petch effect, shown in Equation (9), which describes the relationship between the yield strength of the composite ( σy), material-specific constants ( σoandK), and grain size (d) [47].The constant Kcan be determined by plotting the yield strength as a function of the inverse square root of the grain size ( d) in Figure 15.

The constant K can be determined by plo tting the yield strength as a function of the inverse square root of the grain size ( d) in Figure 15.Despite having only three samples, the plot shows that the R2 value is within an acceptable range, indicating a reliable ﬁt.This strengthening mechanism is distinct from obstacle strengthening because it speci ﬁcally focuses on the in ﬂuence of grain size and boundaries on material strength [48].The Ha ll–Petch equation can be further expanded and expressed in Equation (9) to determine the extent to which the grain size contribution aﬀects the yield strength: Figure 15 .

In composite systems, the reinforcement, such as graphene, bears part of the applied load, thereby reducing the stress on the matrix and effectively increasing the composite’s overall yield strength. This mechanism becomes particularly important when the reinforcement exhibits a much higher stiffness and strength than the matrix, allowing it to carry a substantial portion of the load and thereby enhancing the mechanical properties of the entire composite [50]: ∆σLT=SσmVf 4(12) All the constants used for the strengthening mechanisms are compiled in Table 7.Some constants are derived from the experimental data in this study, while others are taken from references.Due to the complexity of the equations, Table 8 provides a summary of the calculation procedures.After performing the calculations, Table 9 presents the contributions of each strengthening mechanism.Table 7.Parameters for calculating the strengthening mechanism.

Among the two compositions studied, the load transfer mechanism is the most significant contributor to yield strength, as expected, since it is directly proportional to the material’s yield strength. The second-most influential mechanism is the Hall–Petch effect, related to the grain boundaries observed in all samples.While this mechanism strengthens the material, its impact is less than that of load transfer.Orowan strengthening is the third-most significant mechanism, likely less pronounced due to the lower volume fraction of reinforcement in the compositions.Finally, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch contributes the least, which is reasonable given that no heat treatment was applied to enhance its effects.4.2.Fracture Surface Study The fracture surfaces of the samples used in this study were analyzed to understand the failure mechanisms during tensile testing.Typically, fracture surfaces can be classified into two main categories: brittle and ductile.
Each of these fracture types revealed important information about the material’s behavior under stress, particularly in relation to the microstructural features of the composite. For the as-cast 0 wt.% graphene sample, the SEM images in Figure 16A reveal distinct microvoids and dimples characteristic of ductile fracture behavior.These microvoids suggest that the material underwent significant plastic deformation before failure.The presence of cup-like structures further corroborates the ductile nature of this sample, indicating that the material retains a more ductile response under tensile stress.In contrast, the introduction of 0.1 wt.% graphene, as observed in Figure 16B, resulted in a noticeable shift toward brittle fracture behavior.The SEM images exhibit clear cleavage planes marked by river patterns, which indicate a brittle fracture mechanism.This suggests that even a small addition of graphene can induce brittleness in the material.
Moreover, inclusions of non-metallic reinforcement, identified as graphene with elemental carbon content, were evident in the EDS images. As the graphene content increased to 0.2 wt.%, as shown in Figure 16C, the fracture surface analysis revealed a mix of ductile and brit- tle features.While microvoids were still present, indicating some ductile behavior, the increased prevalence of cleavage planes suggested a stronger tendency toward brittleness.This behavior can be attributed to the higher graphene content, which may lead to the agglomeration of graphene particles, which act as stress concentrators and reduce the overall ductility of the material.Materials 2024 ,17, 4673 17 of 22 Materials 2024 , 17, 4673 17 of 22 Table 9.Each strengthening mechanism contribution.Materials HP LT CTE Orowan AM60B 0.1 wt% 14.3869 28.23015426 0.001699 0.078315446 AM60B 0.2 wt% 7.237 45.65757504 0.002376 0.028294488 4.2.
Fracture Surface Study The fracture surfaces of the samples used in this study were an alyzed to understand the failure mechanisms during tensile testing. Typically, fracture surfaces can be classi ﬁed into two main categories: bri ttle and ductile.Each of these fracture types revealed important information about the material’s behavior under stress, particularly in relation to the microstructural features of the composite.For the as-cast 0 wt.% graphene sample, the SEM images in Figure 16A reveal distinct microvoids and dimples characteristic of ductile fracture behavior.These microvoi ds suggest that the material underwent signiﬁcant plastic deformation before failure.The presence of cup-like structures further corroborates the ductile nature of this sample, indicating that the material retains a more ductile response under tensile stress.Figure 16.Fracture Surface Study of AM60B-xGraphene ( A) x = 0, ( B) x = 0.1, ( C) x = 0.2.
In contrast, the introduction of 0.1 wt.% gr aphene, as observed in Figure 16B, resulted in a noticeable shift toward bri ttle fracture behavior. The SEM images exhibit clear cleavage planes marked by river pa tterns, which indicate a bri ttle fracture mechanism.This suggests that even a small addition of graphene can induce bri ttleness in the material.Moreover, inclusions of non-metallic reinforcement, identi ﬁed as graphene with elemental carbon content, were evident in the EDS images.As the graphene content Figure 16.Fracture Surface Study of AM60B-xGraphene ( A) x = 0, ( B) x = 0.1, ( C) x = 0.2.As observed, the 0.2 wt.% graphene addition tends to increase the brittleness of the material compared to other concentrations.Consequently, further SEM-EDS analysis was conducted to better understand the fracture behavior at this level of graphene con- tent.Figure 17 provides a detailed examination of the fracture surface for the 0.2 wt.% graphene composite.
In Figure 17A, EDS mapping highlights the presence of graphene agglomerations, as evidenced by the elevated carbon content. The EDS element maps confirm the presence of carbon-rich regions, indicative of graphene clusters, which likely contribute to the observed brittleness by acting as stress concentrators [ 57].Figure 17B shows the EDS spectrum, which reveals a high percentage of carbon, confirming the pres- ence of graphene within the material.This finding supports the notion that the increased graphene content leads to agglomeration, thus reducing ductility and promoting brittle failure mechanisms.Materials 2024 ,17, 4673 18 of 22 Materials 2024 , 17, 4673 18 of 22 increased to 0.2 wt.%, as shown in Figure 16C, the fracture surface analysis revealed a mix of ductile and bri ttle features.While microvoids were st ill present, indicating some ductile behavior, the increased prevalence of cleavage planes suggested a stronger tendency toward bri ttleness.
This beha vior can be a ttributed to the higher graphene content, which may lead to the agglomeration of graphene particles, which act as stress concentrators and reduce the overall ductility of the material. As observed, the 0.2 wt.% graphene addition tends to increase the bri ttleness of the material compared to other concentrations.Consequently, further SEM-EDS analysis was conducted to be tter understand the fracture behavior at this level of graphene content.Figure 17 provides a detailed examination of th e fracture surface for the 0.2 wt.% graphene composite.In Figure 17A, EDS mapping highlights the presence of graphene agglomerations, as evidenced by the elevat ed carbon content.The EDS element maps conﬁrm the presence of carbon-rich regions, indicative of graphene clusters, which likely contribute to the observed bri ttleness by acting as stress concentrators [57].
Figure 17B shows the EDS spectrum, which reveals a high percentage of carbon, con ﬁrming the presence of graphene within the material. This ﬁnding supports the notion that the increased graphene content leads to agglomeration, thus reducing ductility and promoting bri ttle failure mechanisms.Figure 17.Additional SEM-fracture surface of AM60B-0.2wt.%.( A) EDS mapping.( B) EDS spectra .4.3.Regression Analysis Using Machine Learning Metrics Figure 18 illustrates the evaluation metrics used in the regression analysis of the stress–strain curves for the samples in this study.From Figure 18A–C, it is evident that all machine learning metrics decrease as the strain percentage increases.This trend indicates that regression analysis becomes increasingly accurate as the strain percentage increases.The exact values of these metrics are given in Tables 6–8.Figure 17.Additional SEM-fracture surface of AM60B-0.2wt.%.( A) EDS mapping.( B) EDS spectra.4.3.
Regression Analysis Using Machine Learning Metrics Figure 18 illustrates the evaluation metrics used in the regression analysis of the stress–strain curves for the samples in this study. From Figure 18A–C, it is evident that all machine learning metrics decrease as the strain percentage increases.This trend indicates that regression analysis becomes increasingly accurate as the strain percentage increases.The exact values of these metrics are given in Tables 6–8.Materials 2024 , 17, 4673 19 of 22 Figure 18.MSE, R2, and MAE for the stress–strain curve AM60B-xGraphene: ( A) x = 0, ( B) x = 0.1, (C) x = 0.2.Interestingly, the mean squared error (MSE) was higher for the sample with 0.1 wt.% graphene reinforcement than for the sample without reinforcement.However, the sample with 0.2 wt.% graphene exhibited the highes t MSE, suggesting that the machine learning model found it more challenging to converge with increasing reinforcement.
This could be due to the complexity introduced by the reinforcement, which may have a ﬀected the model’s ability to accurately predict the stress–strain relationship. Moreover, the R 2 metric, which is negative in some cases, indicates that the model does not adequately capture variance in the data.Despite this, Table 10 shows that the evaluat ed strain was 0.5 %, which is in the elastic region.The evaluated elastic modulus vari ed, with AM60B with 0.1 wt.% graphene exhibiting the highest.Note that the machine learning metric for all samples is the AM60B model without reinforcement, featuring minimum error.The mean absolute error (MAE) follows a similar trend to the MSE, furthe r highlighting the challenges faced by the regression model with di ﬀerent reinforcement levels.This study shows that regression analysis, particularly linear regression, can be a useful tool for understanding the material behavior in the elastic region.
Materials may not always exhibit perfectly linear behavior in this region, and slight deviations can occur.

• Incorporating 0.1 wt.% graphene into the AM60B magnesium alloy resulted in a significant improvement in yield strength, achieving a 12% increase compared to the alloy without graphene. These results indicate that a modest addition of graphene effectively enhances the alloy’s mechanical performance.• The addition of 0.1 wt.% graphene not only enhanced the yield strength by approxi- mately 13.4% but also increased the strain at break by 8.8%.This suggests that a small amount of graphene slightly improves both the strength and ductility of the alloy, making it more robust and versatile for various applications.• However, increasing the graphene content to 0.2 wt.% reduced the tensile strength.This decline was likely due to the agglomeration of graphene particles and the resulting increase in brittleness, which compromised the alloy’s overall mechanical properties.
• Regression analysis of the tensile curves showed that the addition of 0.1 and 0.2 wt.% graphene slightly reduced the model accuracy, as reflected by the mean squared error (MSE) of approximately 0.065. However, the accuracy remained high, indicating the model’s robustness despite the challenges posed by the reinforcement.• The thermal stability of AM60B/graphene composites, particularly in relation to the formation of the MgC 2phase, was not assessed in this study.Given that graphene is well-regarded for its excellent thermal stability, investigating this aspect could provide valuable insights into how it influences the thermal behavior of the composites.• In future work, the exploration of more complex regions of the stress–strain curve, such as the plastic region, may benefit from hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.Materials 2024 ,17, 4673 20 of 22 Author Contributions: Conceptualization, resources, and validation, S.-J.H.; formal analysis and investigation, J.S.
