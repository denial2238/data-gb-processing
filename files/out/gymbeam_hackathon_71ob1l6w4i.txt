However, increased EGR2 expression has been noted in humanand murine lupus, which challenges the notion of the autoimmune suppressive role ofEGR2 in B6 mice. In this study, we derived both conditional EGR2 -/-B6/lprand EGR2-/-B6 mice to elucidate the immune and autoimmune regulatory roles of EGR2 inautoin ﬂammation (B6/lpr) versus physiologically normal (B6) conditions.We found that conditional EGR2 deletion increased spleen weight, enhanced T cell activation and IFN g production, and promoted germinal center B cells and LAG3 +regulatory T cells development in both B6/lpr and B6 mice.Nevertheless, EGR2 deletion also showedstrikingly differential effects in these two strains on T lymphocyte subsets pro ﬁle, Foxp3 + Tregs and plasma cell differentiation, anti-dsDNA autoantibodies and immunoglobulins production, and on the induction of IL-17 in in vitro activated splenocytes.
Speci ﬁcally, EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice signi ﬁcantly decreased serum levels of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, total Ig G, IgM, IgG1, and IgG2a with reduced plasma cells differentiation. Furthermore, EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice had no obvious effect on IgGimmunocomplex deposition, medium caliber vessel, and glomeruli in ﬂammation but increased complement C3 immunocomplex deposition and large caliber vessel inﬂammation in the kidneys.Importantly, we demonstrated that EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice signi ﬁcantly reduced pathogenic CD4 -CD8-CD3+B220+double negative T cells, which correlated with the reduced anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in serum and decreased IL-17 production in splenocytes of EGR2 -/-B6/lpr mice.Together, our data strongly suggest Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 917866 1Edited by: Ram P.

The immunoregulatory role of EGR2 varies at normal or autoin ﬂammation conditions and should not be generalized in differential experimental settings. Keywords: EGR2, anti-dsDNA autoantibody, IL-17, double negative T cell, plasma cell, murine model INTRODUCTION The early growth response protein 2 (EGR2) is a member of Egr zinc ﬁnger transcription factor family.EGR2 was initially identi ﬁed to play a critical role in early hindbrain development and in controlling the process of myelination ( 1,2).Deletion of EGR2 led to perinatal death in mice due to major hindbraindefects ( 1).More recent studies have revealed a vital role of EGR2 in immune system development and function ( 3–7).In normal C57BL/6 (B6) mice, EGR2 is critically involved in the inductionof T cell anergy and EGR2 negatively regulates T cell activationand effector T cell responses ( 8–10).
Conditional deletion of EGR2 in CD2 +lymphocytes in non-autoimmune B6 mice led to a break in immune tolerance and induction of a T cell-driven,lupus-like autoimmune disease in EGR2 -/-B6 mice ( 10). When compared to control B6 mice, these EGR2-/-B6 mice showed heightened T cell activation with the accumulation of CD44+ effector CD4+T cells, increased production of in ﬂammatory cytokine IFN gand IL-17, and signi ﬁcantly higher serum levels of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies and total IgG ( 10).Further, the B6 mice with conditional deletion of EGR2 in CD4+T cells had enhanced germinal center (GC) response and humoral response (11,12).This phenotype was attributed to the loss of immune suppressive function of a speci ﬁc type of Tregs, which are Foxp3 independent and characterized as CD4+CD25-LAG3+(11,12).The studies with conditional EGR2-/-B6 mice suggest an autoimmune suppressive role of EGR2 in normal B6 mice ( 10– 13).
Nevertheless, a candidate gene promoter polymorphism analysis indicated that increased EGR2 gene expression is linked with lupus susceptibility in humans ( 14). Elevated EGR2 expression has also been noted in biopsy specimens of skin andlungs from patients with systemic sclerosis, an autoimmunedisease that has overlapping symptoms with lupus ( 15).We recently reported a signi ﬁcant upregulation of EGR2 expression in both human lupus peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and murine lupus T cells ( 16).Moreover, in vitro inhibition of EGR2 with siRNA signi ﬁcantly reduced IFN g production in activated splenic CD4 +T cells from the spontaneously autoimmune lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, butnot control MRL mice ( 16).These in vitro studies suggest that EGR2 may play a differential role in the regulation of inﬂammatory responses and cytokine production in CD4 +T cells of MRL/lpr mice versus CD4+T cells from their relative control MRL mice.
In this study, to further clarify the role of EGR2 in autoin ﬂammation condition versus normal physiological condition, we derived conditional EGR2 knockout mice in both B6/lpr (a lymphoproliferative, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like autoimmune disease model) and normal B6 geneticbackground. This comprehensive study shows the comparative and differential immunological, developmental, and functional consequences of EGR2 deletion in autoimmune-prone B6/ lpr and normal B6.MATERIAL AND METHOD Mice The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Virginia Tech approved all experimental animal procedures, housing, and care.The B6/lpr (B6.MRL-Faslpr/J, Stock No.000482), B6 (C57BL/6J, Stock No.000664), and hCD2-iCre(B6-Cg-Tg(CD2-icre)4Kio/ J, Stock No.008520) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (JAX, Maine, USA)and maintained in-house.The EGR2 ﬂ/ﬂmice in B6 genetic background were kindly provided by Dr.Warren J.Leonard from NIH/NHLBI.
The development and characterization of EGR2ﬂ/ﬂand EGR2-/-B6 mice have been described in detail in a previous report ( 6). The conditional CD2-speci ﬁc EGR2-/-B6 mice were generated by crossbreeding the EGR2ﬂ/ﬂwith hCD2-iCre in the B6 genetic background.To generate conditional CD2-speci ﬁc EGR2-/-B6/ lpr mice, EGR2ﬂ/ﬂand hCD2-iCre mice were crossbred with B6/lpr mice respectively, to obtain EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr and CD2- CreB6/lpr strains.Then, the EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr and CD2-CreB6/lpr were crossbred to derive CD2-CreEGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr (referred as EGR2-/-B6/lpr) mice.The EGR2-/-B6/lpr and EGR2-/-B6 mice were bred with EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr and EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6 mice respectively, to obtain experimental EGR-/-B6/lpr and EGR2-/- B6 mice.The littermate EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr and EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6, which do not carry the hCD2-iCre gene, were served as wild-typecontrols for EGR -/-B6/lpr and EGR2-/-B6, respectively.Both male and female mice were included in all the experimentalprocedures in this study.
The ﬂoxed and deleted EGR2 gene was PCR con ﬁrmed as previously reported ( 6). The presence of hCD2-iCre gene and lprgene was con ﬁrmed by following the PCR genotyping protocols provided by the JAX laboratory.All mice were housed in our Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-certi ﬁed animal facility at the Virginia-Maryland College of VeterinaryMedicine (VMCVM), Virginia Tech.Mice were fed with acommercial 7013 NIH- 31 Modi ﬁed 6% Mouse/Rat Sterilizable Diet (Harlan Laboratory, Madison, WI, USA) and given water ad libitum .Compared to MRL/lpr mice, the disease progression in B6/lpr mice is slow and less severe; and B6/lpr mice have a lifespan of more than 7 months ( 17,18).We, therefore, euthanized the EGR2 -/-B6/lpr and littermate control EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr mice atDai et al.

Since the previous study showed that EGR-/-B6 mice did not manifest lupus-like phenotypes until 6-8 months of age(10), we euthanized EGR2 -/-B6 and littermate control EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6 mice at 9-10 months of age to investigate the immunoregulatoryroles of EGR2 in B6 mice in this study.All the mice were euthanized by CO 2asphyxiation followed by either cervical dislocation or heart puncture (for blood collection) inaccordance with the IACUC approved protocol.Cell Preparation and Culture The spleen tissue was dissociated into a single cell suspensionfollowing a standard laboratory procedure ( 19–21).
The splenocytes were resuspended at a concentration of 5x10 6/ml in complete RPMI-1640 medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA)supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum(Atlanta Biologicals, Flowery Branch, GA, USA), 1% essentialamino acids (Hyclone), 2mM L-glutamine (Hyclone), 100IU/mLpenicillin/100 mg/mL streptomycin (Hyclone) for cell culture. The splenocytes (2.5x10 6) were plated in 24 well plate and stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 50 ng/ ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA) plus ionomycin (1 mg/ ml, Sigma-Aldrich) without or with protein transport inhibitor(BD GolgiPlug) for 6 hours to analyze cytokines expression.
Forthe induction of IL-17, the splenocytes (1.25x10 6) were plated in 48 well plate and stimulated with either non-pathogenic T helper 17 (Th17) stimuli (20 ng/mL recombinant mouse IL-6 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) plus 3ng/mL recombinanthuman TGF b1 (R&D System Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) and 1mg/mL soluble anti-CD3) or pathogenic Th17 stimuli (20 ng/ mL recombinant mouse IL-6, 10 ng/mL recombinant mouse IL-1b(BioLegend) plus 10ng/mL recombinant mouse IL-23 (eBioscience/Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1mg/mL soluble anti-CD3) for 72 hours. The cell culture supernatants were collected for ELISA assay.Bone marrow cells were prepared by ﬂushing the mouse femora and tibia with ice-cold PBS.The ﬂushed-out cells were passed through a 70 mM cell strainer, pelleted, resuspended with PBS, and then treated with Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium (ACK) lysis buffer to remove red blood cells.
The isolated bone marrow cells were resuspended in MACS buffer (PBSsupplemented with 0.5% BSA and 2mM EDTA) for ﬂow cytometry analysis. Flow Cytometry Flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine speci ﬁc immune cell subsets in the spleen and bone marrow as we have previously reported ( 16,20).The ﬂuorochrome ‐conjugated antibodies used for staining cell surface markers included:eﬂuor-450 (e450)-CD4 (clone RM4-5), APC-CD8 (clone 53- 6.7), FITC-CD3 e(clone 145-2C11), PE-B220 (clone RA3-6B2), PerCP/Cy5.5-CD19 (clone eBio1D3), PerCP/Cy5.5-CD44 (cloneIM7), PE/Cy7-CD62L (clone MEL-14), PerCP/Cy5.5-CD25 (clone PC61.5), e660-GL7 (clone GL-7), e450-CD23 (clone B3B4), and PE-CD223 (LAG3, clone eBioC9B7W) fromeBioscience; APC-CD69 (clone H1.2F3), FITC-CD21/35 (clone7G6) and PE/Cy7-CD43 (clone S7) from BD Bioscience,Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; APC/Cy7-IgD (clone 11-26c.2a), PE- CD138 (clone 281-2), and APC-IgM (clone RMM-1) fromBioLegend.
Dead cells were excluded for the analysis bystaining the cells with propidium iodide (PI, fromImmunoChemistry Technology, LLC, MN, USA). The Foxp3transcription factor staining buffer set (eBioscience) was used for ﬂow cytometry analysis of intracellular antigens as we previously reported ( 16).PE-EGR2 (clone erongr2), Percp-cy5.5-IFN g (XMG1.2) and FITC-IL-17A (eBio17B7) were obtained fromeBioscience.Alexa- ﬂuor 647 (AF647)-Foxp3 (clone MF-14) was purchased from BioLegend.Flow-stained cell samples wereanalyzed on a FACSAria Flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).The data were analyzed with FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR, USA).The cells were ﬁrst gated to remove cell debris (SSC-A vs.FSC-A), then gated for singlets (FSC-H vs.FSC-W).Except for ﬂow analysis of the intracellular antigens, the PI negative (live cells) were further gated to pro ﬁle the immune cell subsets.
Th1 and Th17 Cell Differentiation Naïve CD4+T cells were puri ﬁed from the splenocytes of 6-7- week-old EGR2-/-B6/lpr and control mice by using a mouse naïve CD4+T cells isolation kit from Miltenyi Biotec as we previously reported ( 16). For Th1 differentiation, naïve CD4+T cells (1.5x106)w e r ep l a t e di n4 8 - w e l lp l a t ea n dc u l t u r e dw i t h2 mg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C11, Bio X cell, Lebanon, NH, USA), 1 mg/ml soluble anti-CD28 (clone 37.51, Bio X cell), 5ng/ml IL-2 (eBioscience), 10ng/ml IL-12(eBioscience) and 10 mg/ml anti-IL4 (Bio X cell) for 3 days.For Th17 differentiation, naïve CD4 +T cells (1.5x106)w e r e plated in 48-well plate and cultured with 2 mg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3, 1 mg/ml soluble anti-CD28, 20ng/ml IL-6, 3ng/ml hTGF b1, 10 mg/ml anti-IFN g(Bio X cell) and 10 mg/ml anti-IL4 for 5 days.
The differentiated cells were stimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml), ionomycin (1 mg/ml) plus protein transporter inhibitor (BD GolgiPlug) for 5 hours, and then collected for intracellular ﬂow cytometry analysis of IFN g-a n dI L - 1 7 - expressing cells. ELISA The levels of cytokines in culture supernatant were determinedby ELISA kits from Biolegend and ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc.A laboratory standardized ELISA procedure was performed todetermine the serum level of anti-dsDNA autoantibody ( 22– 24).Serum levels of IgG, IgM, IgG1, and IgG2a were quanti ﬁed with the speci ﬁc ELISA kits (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc) by following manufactory instructions.Serum Blood Urea Nitrogen Measurement The serum Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) levels were measuredwith a BUN Colorimetric Detection kit (ThermoFisherScienti ﬁc) to evaluate the renal function change.Renal Histopathology Renal histopathology analysis was performed as we previously reported ( 21–23).Brie ﬂy, the kidneys were ﬁxed with 10%Dai et al.

A board-certi ﬁed veterinary pathologist assessed the H&E-stained renal sectionsin a blinded fashion.For in ﬂammation, scattered and infrequent deposits of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and/or neutrophils distributed in a nonspeci ﬁc fashion were scored as a 1.Denser deposits targeting identi ﬁable vascular structures were scored as a 2, and large deposits that effaced the local renalparenchyma and vasculature scored as a 3.In ﬂammation locations were divided into the renal pelvis/renal artery/interlobar (large caliber vesse l) and arcuate/interlobular (medium caliber vessel).
Glomerular changes were scored by evaluating mesangial cellularity, mesangial thickening/matrixdeposition, average glomerular size, and presence ofinﬂammatory cells, with a score of 1 indicating mild, 2 indicating moderate, and 3 indicating severe. Renal Immuno ﬂuorescence Kidney sections were possessed as we have previously reported (21,23).Brie ﬂy, kidneys were cut in half, immersed in Tissue- Tek O.C.T.Compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA)and snap freeze in a dry ice bath containing isopropanol.OCTembed frozen kidneys were cut into 5um sections in a cryostat,mounted to histological slides in the ViTALS lab at VMCVM.The frozen kidney section slides were air-dried, ﬁxed with acetone, blocked with anti-CD16/32 (eBiosceince) in PBS with 1% BSA, and then stained with FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouseIgG (H+L) (eBioscience) or PE-conjugated rat anti-mousecomplement C3 (clone RmC11H9; CEDARLANE, Burlington,Ontario, Canada).
The stained slides were mounted withcoverslips using Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent (ThermoFisherScienti ﬁc) and imaged with a digital ﬂuorescence microscope EVOS M5000 (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc). The ﬂuorescent intensities of deposited IgG and C3 were measured with Fiji/ImageJ processing program and normalized by subtracting thebackground ﬂuorescence intensity ( 25).At least six glomeruli were analyzed per sample.Statistical Analysis The graphic presentations of data were generated with GraphPadPrism software.All values in g raphs were given as means ± SD.Two-tailed, unpaired parametric t-tests embedded in the Prism software were performed to determine the statistical signi ﬁcance between control and conditional EGR2 knockout mice (EGR2 ﬂ/ﬂB6/ lpr vs.EGR2-/-B6/lpr; EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6 vs.EGR2-/-B6).*, **, ***, and **** indicate p< 0.05, p<0 .0 1 , p< 0.001, and p<0.0001, respectively.
RESULTS EGR2 Deletion in B6/lpr Mice Promotes Splenomegaly but Reduces Serum Levels of Anti-dsDNA Autoantibodies and Total Immunoglobins Since EGR2 null mice are perinatally lethal ( 1,2), we used the hCD2-iCre transgenic line ( 26), which deletes the ﬂoxed targetgene in both T and B lymphocytes to generate a conditional EGR2 knockout B6/lpr mouse model. We veri ﬁed the deletion of EGR2 in CD4+T, CD8+T, and CD19+B cells of EGR2-/-B6/lpr mice ( Supplemental Figure 1 ).Consistent with the previous report that EGR2 deletion promoted splenomegaly in B6 mice(10), we found that EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice also signiﬁcantly increased spleen weight ( Figures 1A, B ).However, there was no signi ﬁcant difference in the absolute splenic cell numbers between EGR2 -/-B6/lpr and littermate control EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr mice ( Figure 1C ).EGR2 deletion did not affect the bodyweight of B6/lpr mice at the endpoint ( Figure 1D ).
It has been reported that EGR2 deletion in B6 mice induced lupus-like autoimmune disease in ag ed mice with increased levels of anti-dsDNA autoantibodie s and total IgG in serum ( 10). In striking contrast to B6 mice, EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice signi ﬁcantly reduced serum levels of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, total IgG, IgM,IgG1, and IgG2a subtypes ( Figures 1E –I).EGR2 Deletion in B6/lpr Mice Has Limited Effects on Renal Function Ap r e v i o u ss t u d yh a ss h o w nt h a tE G R 2-/-B6 mice had increased IgG deposition in kidney and developed severe glomerulonephritis withthe production of proteinuria ( 10).We were unable to detect obvious proteinuria production in both EGR2 -/-B6/lpr and control EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr mice.Further, there was no difference in the serum BUN levels between EGR2-/-B6/lpr and control EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr mice (Figure 2A ), suggesting EGR2 deletion has no signi ﬁcant effect on renal function in B6/lpr mice.
The renal histopathology showed thatdeleting EGR2 in B6/lpr mice did not enhance glomerularinﬂammation and changes in B6/lpr mice ( Figure 2B ). We only observed a signi ﬁcant increase of immune cell in ﬁltrating and inﬂammation in large caliber vessel s in renal pelvis/renal artery/ interlobar area, but not in medium caliber vessels at the arcuate/interlobular region in the kidneys of EGR2 -/-B6/lpr mice (Figure 2B ).EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice did not increase IgG immune complexes deposition in the kidneys ( Figure 2C ).However, compared to controls, there was a signi ﬁcant increase of complement C3 immune complexes deposition in the kidneys of EGR2-/-B6/lpr ( Figure 2C ).Together, our data show that EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice only increased complement C3 immunecomplexes deposition and large vascular in ﬂammation in kidney and it had no signi ﬁcant effects on IgG deposition, glomerular inﬂammation, and renal function.
EGR2 Deletion in B6 Mice Promotes Splenomegaly and Anti-dsDNA Autoantibodies Production The above data with EGR2-/-B6/lpr mice showed that EGR2 deletion reduced serum levels of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies andtotal IgG, which is inconsistent with the previous report ( 10). To compare the effect of EGR2 deletion in the context ofautoin ﬂammation (B6/lpr) and normal physiological states (B6) at the same experimental settings, we generated conditional EGR2 knockout B6 mice (EGR2 -/-B6) with the same hCD2-iCre strain in our facility.Consistently with theprevious report ( 10), there was a signi ﬁcant increase in spleen weight and cellularity in EGR2 -/-B6 mice compared to controlsDai et al.Immunoregulatory Role of EGR2 Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 917866 4 (Figures 3A –C).While EGR2 deletion did not affect the bodyweight of B6/lpr mice at the endpoint ( Figure 1D ), it reduced the bodyweight of B6 mice at the endpoint(Figure 3D ).
We found that EGR2 deletion increased serum levels of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in B6 mice, although inmuch less magnitude than previously reported ( Figure 3E ).

Together, our data with EGR2-/-B6/lpr and EGR2-/-B6 mice demonstrated that EGR2 has a differential role in the regulation of immunoglobins andanti-dsDNA autoantibody production in B6/lpr versus B6 mice. Deletion of EGR2 Suppresses Plasma Cell Differentiation in B6/lpr, but Not in B6 Mice To understand the cellular mechanism underlying reduced antibody production in EGR2-/-B6/lpr mice, but not in EGR2-/- B6 mice, we performed ﬂow cytometry to analyze the development of germinal center (GC) B cells and major antibody-producingcells, plasmablasts and plasma cells.In both B6/lpr and B6 mice,EGR2 deletion did not affect the percentage of CD19 +B cells in the spleens but signi ﬁcantly increased GL7+IgD-GC B cells in the gated CD19+cells, leading to the increase of percentage CD19+GL7+IgD-GC B cells in the splenocytes ( Figures 4A , 5A).
Importantly, we found that EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice signiﬁcantly reduced the percentage of both CD19+CD138+ plasmablasts and CD19-CD138+plasma cells in the spleens (Figure 4B ). However, in normal B6 mice, EGR2 deletion led to a trend of increase in the percentage of CD19-CD138+plasma cells and no change of CD19+CD138+plasmablasts in the spleens(Figure 5B ).We also observed a reduction in the percentage of CD19-CD138+plasma cells in the bone marrow cells of EGR2-/- B6/lpr, but not in EGR2-/-B6 mice ( Figures 4C ,5C).Further ﬂow analysis of B cell development in bone marrow indicated thatEGR2 deletion did not signi ﬁcantly affect the early B cell development (Pre-ProB, Pro-B, Pre-B, immature/mature B) in b o t hB 6 / l p ra n dB 6m i c e( Supplemental Figures 2A, B ).Moreover, EGR2 deletion did not signi ﬁcantly affect the development of marginal zone B (MZB) and follicular B (FOB)in the spleens of both B6/lpr and B6 mice ( Supplemental Figures 2C, D ).
Together, our data indicate that EGR2 deletion speciﬁcally affects the late B cell development/differentiation (GC B and plasma cell) and has no signi ﬁcant effect on early B cell development. EGR2 deletion promotes GCB development in bothB6/lpr and B6 mice but apparently has an opposite effect on thedifferentiation of plasma cells in these two strains.EGR2 Deletion Has a Differential Effect on the Development of Atypical CD25-LAG3+ Tregs and Traditional CD25+Foxp3+Tregs in B6/lpr A series of studies from Dr.Keishi Fujio ’s research group has shown that EGR2 is required for the immune suppressivefunction of a speci ﬁc group of LAG3 expressing, Foxp3 independent Tregs (CD4 +CD25-LAG3+Tregs; hereinafter referred to as LAG3+Tregs) ( 3,11,12,27).EGR2-/-B6 and BC D EF G H IA FIGURE 3 | EGR2 deletion in B6 mice promotes splenomegaly and anti-dsDNA autoantibody production.

While EGR2 deletion had no obvious effect on the percentage CD25- LAG3+cells in the gated CD4+T cells of freshly-isolated splenocytes, deleting EGR2 signi ﬁcantly increased the percentage of CD25-LAG3+cells in the gated CD4+T cells of anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 stimulated splenocytes from EGR2-/- B6/lpr mice ( Figure 6A ). However, we found that deleting EGR2 in B6/lpr mice signi ﬁcantly reduced the percentage of CD25+Foxp3+cells in the gated CD4+T cells of both freshly- isolated and anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 stimulated splenocytes (Figure 6B ).In B6 mice, EGR2 deletion led to a signi ﬁcant increase of CD25-LAG3+cells in gated CD4+cells of both freshly-isolated and anti-CD 3 plus anti-CD28 activated splenocytes ( Figure 6C ).These data are consistent with the previous report that EGR2 is dispensable for LAG3+Treg development ( 11).The previous study did not show a signiﬁcant effect of EGR2 deletion on Foxp3+Treg in normal B6 mice ( 6).
We also only observed a trend of increase in the percentage of Foxp3+CD25+Tregs in gated CD4+cells of either freshly isolated or activated splenocytes from EGR2-/-B6 mice (Figure 6D ). Together, our data demonstrate that EGR2 differentially regulates the development of Foxp3+Tregs and LAG3+Tregs in the B6/lpr mice.EGR2 Deletion Increases IFN g, but Decreases IL-17 Production in Activated Splenocytes of B6/lpr Mice One of the important roles of EGR2 is the negative regulation of T cell activation.Major supportive evidence for the autoimmunesuppressive role of EGR2 in B6 mice is that EGR2 deletioninduced T cell hyperactivation and heightened production of inﬂammatory cytokines IFN gand IL-17 ( 10).In consistency, we found that deleting EGR2 in vivo signiﬁcantly increased IFN g production in in vitro activated splenocytes from both B6/lpr and B6 mice ( Figures 7A, D ).
The intracellular cytokine analysis demonstrated that EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice increased IFN g expression in gated splenic CD4 +T cells, but not CD8+T cells (Figures 7B, C ). Correspondingly, there was a signi ﬁcant increase in the percentage of CD44+cells and CD44 expression intensity in gated CD4+T cells, but not in CD8+T cells of EGR2-/-B6/lpr ( Figures 8A, B ).It is noticeable that the majority of the splenic CD4+T and CD8+T cells were already activated and possessed CD44 markers (about 80%) in the B6/lpr mice atthe experimental age.EGR2 deletion in B6 mice signi ﬁcantly increased IFN gexpression in both gated splenic CD4 +T cells and CD8+T cells ( Figures 7E, F ).Correspondingly, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of CD44+cells and CD44 expression intensity in both gated splenic CD4+T and CD8+T cells of EGR2-/-B6 mice compared to controls ( Figures 8C, D ).

The intracellular cytokine analysis showed a trend of increase of IL-17 expressionin gated CD4 +,b u tn o tC D 8+T cells of EGR2-/-B6 mice (Figures 9E, F ) We then activated splenocytes with Th17-inducing stimuli to conﬁrm the differential role of EGR2 in the regulation of Th17 effector responses in B6/lpr versus B6 mice. Followingstimulation with either non-pathogenic Th17 stimuli (IL-6 plusTGF b1) or pathogenic Th17 stimuli (IL6 plus IL-1 band IL23) stimuli, there was a signi ﬁcant reduction of IL-17 in the splenocytes from EGR2 -/-B6/lpr mice compared to control EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr mice ( Figures 9G, H ).Nevertheless, EGR2 deletion in B6 mice had no obvious effect on IL-17 productionin response to non-pathogenic Th17 stimuli but signi ﬁcantly increased IL-17 production in pathogenic Th17 stimuli activatedsplenocytes ( Figures 9I, J ).
Moreover, we found that EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice suppressed naïve CD4 +T cell differentiation into Th17 cells but promoted naïve CD4+T cell differentiation into Th1 cells ( Figure 9K ). Together, our data clearly demonstrate that in B6/lpr mice EGR2 has a suppressiverole in the in vitro induction of IFN gand Th1 differentiation but a positive regulatory role in in vitro induction of IL-17 and Th17 differentiation.However, in B6 mice, EGR2 has a similar suppressive role in the in vitro induction of both IFN gand IL-17.EGR2 Deletion Substantially Reduces B220+Double Negative T Cells in B6/lpr Mice EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice decreased IL-17 production in activated splenocytes without suppressing IL-17 expression in the gated CD4+and CD8+T cells ( Figures 9B, C ).We then analyzed the T lymphocyte pro ﬁles in EGR2-/-B6/lpr and control B6/lpr mice to determine whether EGR2 deletion altered Tlymphocyte pro ﬁles, leading to the reduction of IL-17 in activated splenocytes.
Compared to control EGR2 ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr mice, EGR2-/-B6/lpr mice had a signi ﬁcant increase in the percentage of splenic CD4+T, but not CD8+T cells (Figures 10A, B ). The absolute splenic CD4+and CD8+T cells number were increased in EGR2-/-B6/lpr mice (data not shown).In contrast, EGR2 deletion in B6 mice signi ﬁcantly reduced the percentage of both CD4+T and CD8+T cells in the spleens (Figures 10E, F ).Since EGR2 deletion increased splenic cellularity in B6 mice ( Figure 3C ), the total splenic CD4+T cell number in EGR2-/-B6 mice was still comparable to control EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6 mice (data not shown).The accumulation of CD4-CD8-CD3+double negative (DN) T cells is a unique characteristic in lprlupus mice, which is caused by faslprmutation ( 28–30).The DN T cells identi ﬁed in lprmice also express B220.Increased DN T cells have also been identi ﬁed in lupus patients and are involved in lupus pathogenesis ( 31).Further, DN T cells were major IL-17 producers in lupus.
Here, we found that deletion of EGR2substantially inhibited the development of DN T cells in B6/lprmice. There was a signi ﬁcant reduction in the B220 +DN T cellpercentage and also absolute number in the spleens of EGR2-/- B6/lpr mice compared to control EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr mice (Figures 10C, D ).The percentage of CD4-CD8-CD3+DN T cells was low in the spleens of normal B6 mice (around 2.5%).EGR2 deletion reduced the percentage of DN T cells in B6 mice(Figure 10G ).Due to increased splenic cellularity in EGR2 -/-B6 mice, there was no difference in the absolute DN T cells number between EGR2-/-B6 mice and control EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6 mice (Figure 10H ).Together, our data show that EGR2 deletion differentially alters the CD4+and CD8+T cell pro ﬁles in the spleens of B6/lpr and B6 mice.Importantly, we found that EGR2deletion signi ﬁcantly reduced B220 +DN T cells numbers in B6/ lpr mice, which may contribute to reduced IL-17 production in activated splenocytes from EGR2-/-B6/lpr mice.
DISCUSSION Increased EGR2 expression, rather than decreased EGR2expression, has been identi ﬁed in human patients with lupus or systemic sclerosis and the murine models of these two diseases (15,16). These data seem to contradict the previous reports of the autoimmune suppressive role of EGR2 in B6 mice ( 10,11,13, 27).Moreover, there are inconsistent data with regard to the role of EGR2 in the regulation of Th1/Th17 differentiation andeffector T cell response to the infection of different viralpathogens ( 6,32–36).Therefore, we believe that it is important to investigate the immune and autoimmune regulatory role of EGR2 in speci ﬁc pathogenic/autoin ﬂammatory settings.This is theﬁrst study to characterize and compare the immune regulatory role of EGR2 in vivo in the context of autoin ﬂammation (B6/lpr) versus normal physiology (B6) conditions.
Analysis of CD2 speci ﬁcE G R 2 -/-B6/lpr and EGR2-/-B6 mice in this study revealed that while EGR2 has some similar immunological effects in B6/lpr and B6 mice, the differential immune regulatory roles of EGR2 in these two strainswere also evident (Summarized in Table 1 ). The most striking ﬁnding in this study is that EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice signi ﬁcantly suppressed the production of anti- dsDNA autoantibody ( Figure 1E ), a hallmark of the autoimmune parameter in B6/ lprmice.Further, EGR2 deletion did not deteriorate renal function in B6/lpr and it only increasedinﬂammation at large caliber vessels ( Figure 2 ).These data are inconsistent with the previous ﬁnding that EGR2 deletion in B6 mice induced lupus-like autoimmune disease with thedevelopment of glomerulonephritis and high levels of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in serum ( 10).
Consistent with the previous reports ( 10,11), we demonstrated that EGR2 deletion in B6 mice promoted splenomegaly, T cell activation, IFN gand IL-17 production, and GC B development. However, we did notobserve a clinical manifestation of lupus-like disease in ourEGR2 -/-B6 mice.The serum levels of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies were still very low in 9-10-months old EGR2-/- B6 mice, although they were higher than the littermate controlEGR2 ﬂ/ﬂB6 mice ( Figure 3 ).The lack of apparent autoimmune disease manifestation in our EGR2-/-B6 mice may be caused byDai et al.Immunoregulatory Role of EGR2 Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 917866 11 the differences in the diet, housing condition, and local environment in our animal facility from the others.The inﬂuences of commercial diet and animal housing facilities on the disease manifestation in the murine lupus models have beenpreviously reported ( 23,37).
In addition, due to the overlapping role of EGR2 and EGR3, deletion of both EGR2 and EGR3 genesis necessary for the develop ment of severe lupus-like autoimmune disease in B6 mice ( 11,12). We were also unable to detect obvious production of proteinuria in either EGR2 -/-B6/ lpr or control B6/lpr mice.It is likely because although B6/lprmice produce a signi ﬁcant amount of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, they only show limited glomerular lesions anddo not develop severe nephritis or proteinuria compared toMRL/lpr mice ( 17,38).In addition, in the current study, we used the Chemistrip-2GP test strip, a semi-quantitative method to rapidly measure the total protein level in urine.A more sensitive and quantitative method will be considered in futurestudies for detecting protein levels, especially albumin levels inurine samples.EGR2 deletion promoted GC response and antibody production in B6 mice due to the loss of immune suppressive function of LAG3 +Tregs ( 11,12).
Here, we demonstrated that EGR2 deletion similarly promoted GC B cell development in B6and B6/lpr mice ( Figures 4A ,5A). Nevertheless, EGR2 deletion signiﬁcantly suppressed the differentiation of major antibody- secreting cells, CD19 +CD138+plasmablasts and CD19-CD138+ plasma cells in the B6/lpr mice but had no obvious effect onplasma cell differentiation in B6 mice ( Figures 4B ,5B).Althoughthe mechanism underlying EGR2 differentially regulating plasma cell differentiation in B6/lpr and B6 mice remains unknown, this data provides a cellular mechanism underlying the reduced anti- dsDNA and total immunoglobulins in EGR2 -/-B6/lpr mice.Recent studies suggested that atypical Foxp3 independent LAG3+Tregs, other than Foxp3+Tregs, play an important role in suppressing GC response and humoral responses in B6 mice(11,12,27).
However, it is unlikely that EGR2 regulates inﬂammation and humoral response in B6/lpr viaregulating LAG3 +Tregs since LAG3+Tregs are already dysfunctional in B6/lpr mice due to the fasmutation. A previous study has shown that although the development of LAG3+Tregs is EGR2 and Fas independent, the autoimmune suppressive function of LAG3+ Tregs is EGR2 and Fas dependent ( 11).The adoptive transfer of LAG3+Tregs from Fas-suf ﬁcient MRL mice, but not LAG3+Tregs from fas-mutant MRL/lpr mice suppressed lupus disease development in recipient MRL/lpr mice ( 11).In addition, we found that EGR2 deletion signi ﬁcantly reduced the percentage of CD25+Foxp3+cells in gated splenic CD4+T cells of B6/lpr mice, but not of B6 mice.It is noteworthy that EGR2 deletion did notchange the percentage of CD4 +CD25+Foxp3+Tregs in the spleens of EGR2-/-B6/lpr mice due to the increase of the percentage of splenic CD4+T cells (data not shown).
Whether EGR2 deletion affects the immune suppressive function of CD25+Foxp3+Tregs is unknown and warrants further investigation for understandingthe differential role of EGR2 in B6/lpr and B6 mice. Accumulation of CD44 +effector T cells and heightened production of IFN gand IL-17 also play a major role in the BC D EFG HA FIGURE 10 | EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice dramatically reduces B220+double negative T cells.(A, B) Summary graphs show increased percentage of CD4+and no change of CD8+single positive cells in the spleens of EGR2-/-B6/lpr mice compared to controls (n ≥16).(C, D) Representative ﬂow plots and summary graph show that EGR2 deletion signi ﬁcantly reduced the percentage (C)and also absolute cell numbers (D)of CD4-CD8-CD3+B220+double negative T cells in the spleens of B6/lpr mice.(E, F) Summary graphs show decreased percentage of both CD4+and CD8+cells in the spleens of EGR2-/-B6 mice compared to control EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6 mice (n=12 each).

This may explain the increase of IFN g expression in gated CD4+T cells, but not in gated CD8+T cells of EGR2-/-B6/lpr mice ( Figures 7B, C ). Importantly, we found that EGR2 has an opposite role in the regulation of proin ﬂammatory cytokine IL-17 production in B6/ l p rv e r s u sB 6m i c e .D e l e t i n gE G R 2 in vivo signi ﬁcantly suppressed IL-17 production in activated splenocytes from B6/ lpr mice but increased IL-17 production in activated splenocytesfrom B6 mice ( Figure 9 ).Intracellular cytokine analysis showed that EGR2 deletion did not affect IL-17 expression in either gatedCD4 +T cells or CD8+T cells of B6/lpr mice.So, it is likely that EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr mice may reduce immune cell subsetsthat produce IL-17, such as CD4+and CD8+T cells.However, there were increased CD4+T cell percentage and no change in CD8+T cell percentage in EGR2-/-B6/lpr compared to control (Figures 10A, B ).
Importantly, we found that B220+DN T cells were dramatically reduced in EGR2-/-B6/lpr mice. Increased DN T cell numbers have been identi ﬁed in human SLE patients and murine lupus, which correlate with disease activity ( 31,39).DN T cells are the primary producer of IL-17 in lupus.Theinﬁltration of IL-17 expressing DN T cells plays a signi ﬁcant role in kidney in ﬂammation and lupus nephritis ( 31,39,40).In addition, DN T cells have also been shown to promote tissuedamage by helping B cells to promote the production of IgG and pathogenic anti-dsDNA autoantibodies ( 41–43).The signiﬁcantly reduced DN T cells in EGR2 -/-B6/lpr explains, at least in part, the reduction of IL-17, total immunoglobins, andanti-dsDNA autoantibodies in EGR2 -/-B6/lpr mice.
While B6/lpr strain does not typically show marked gender differences indisease development, we observed that female EGR2 ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr mice had a higher serum level of anti-dsDNA and a higher percentage of B220+DN T cells than male EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr mice. Accompanied by these, there was also a more pronouncedsuppression effect of EGR2 deletion on anti-dsDNA and DN Tc e l l si nf e m a l eB 6 / l p rm i c er e l a t i v et om a l eB 6 / l p rm i c e(Supplementary Figures 3A, B ).We also noticed that EGR2 deletion had a more substantial effect on spleen weight in female B6/lpr mice relative to male mice ( Supplementary Figure 3C ).However, EGR2 deletion in B6 mice only showed a female-biasedeffect on spleen weight, but not on serum anti-dsDNA and DN Tcells ( Supplementary Figures 3D –F).
Previous studies have shown that deletion of IL-23R in B6/lpr and MRL/lpr mice reduced DN T, IFN g- and IL-17- producing cells, suppressed anti-dsDNA autoantibodies and total IgGproduction, reduced immune complex deposition, and ameliorated lupus nephritis in the lprlupus mice ( 44,45). Even though EGR2 deletion signi ﬁcantly reduced DN T cells and suppressed the production of IL-17, anti-dsDNAautoantibody, and total IgG, we did not observe theamelioration of renal in ﬂammation in EGR2 -/-B6/lpr mice.Indeed, there was even an increase of C3 immunocomplex deposition and in ﬂammation in large-caliber vessels in kidneys of EGR2-/-B6/lpr mice.The loss of the mitigation effect on renal inﬂammation in EGR2-/-B6/lpr mice is likely due to enhanced IFNgproduction, another key in ﬂammatory cytokine driving renal in ﬂammation and lupus nephritis in lprmice.
Given the important role of IL-23/IL-23 receptor signaling pathway indeveloping and maintaining DN T cells in secondary lymphoid organs ( 44–46), further investigation of whether EGR2 regulates IL-23/IL23R signaling may aid us to elucidate the mechanismunderlying the positive role of EGR2 in regulating DN T cells. We have shown that EGR2, a negative regulator of T cell activation, was increased in lupus cells ( 16).Similar phenomena were observed for other genes, such as protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor t ype 22 (PTPN22).PTPN22, a negative regulator of T cell activation, has been associated withthe development of multiple autoimmune diseases, includingSLE, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and autoimmunethyroid disease ( 47).Similar to EGR2, while deletion ofTABLE 1 | Summary of the similar and differential outcomes of EGR2 deletion in B6/lpr versus B6 mice.

*EGR2-/-B6lpr mice were compared to EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6/lpr. **EGR2-/-B6 mice were compared to EGR2ﬂ/ﬂB6 mice.Dai et al.Immunoregulatory Role of EGR2 Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 917866 13 PTPN22 in B6 mice resulted in the increased activation of effector T cells and elevated GC response and antibodyproduction, PTPN22 expression/function is increased in SLE(47,48).Together, our data strongly suggest that the immune and autoimmune regulatory role of EGR2 in normalphysiological and different pathological conditions should not be generalized.To fully understand the autoimmune regulatory role (either protective or detrimental) of EGR2, in addition tonormal B6 and autoimmune-prone B6/lpr mice, further studieswith different autoimmune disease models and cell-speci ﬁc deletion of EGR2 are warranted.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The original contributions presented in the study are included inthe article/supplementary material.
