SHORT REPORT Open Access No effect of creatine supplementation on oxidative stress and cardiovascular parameters inspontaneously hypertensive rats Christiano RR Alves1, Igor H Murai1, Pamella Ramona2, Humberto Nicastro1, Luiz RG Bechara1, Antonio H Lancha Jr1, Patrícia C Brum1, Maria C Irigoyen2and Bruno Gualano1* Abstract Background: Exacerbated oxidative stress is thought to be a mediator of arterial hypertension.It has been postulated that creatine (Cr) could act as an antioxidant agent preventing increased oxidative stress.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of nine weeks of Cr or placebo supplementation on oxidative stress andcardiovascular parameters in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).Findings: Lipid hydroperoxidation, one important oxidative stress marker, remained unchanged in the coronary artery (Cr: 12.6 ± 1.5 vs.Pl: 12.2 ± 1.7 nmol·mg -1; p = 0.87), heart (Cr: 11.5 ± 1.8 vs.Pl: 14.6 ± 1.1 nmol·mg-1;p= 0.15), plasma (Cr: 67.7 ± 9.1 vs.
Pl: 56.0 ± 3.2 nmol·mg-1; p = 0.19), plantaris (Cr: 10.0 ± 0.8 vs. Pl: 9.0 ± 0.8 nmol·mg- 1; p = 0.40), and EDL muscle (Cr: 14.9 ± 1.4 vs.Pl: 17.2 ± 1.5 nmol·mg-1; p = 0.30).Additionally, Cr supplementation affected neither arterial blood pressure nor heart structure in SHR (p > 0.05).Conclusions: Using a well-known experimental model of systemic arterial hypertension, this study did not confirm the possible therapeutic effects of Cr supplementation on oxidative stress and cardiovascular dysfunction associated with arterial hypertension.Keywords: Arterial hypertension, Therapeutic effects, Phosphocreatine Introduction It has been suggested that ex acerbated oxidative stress and its consequent oxidative damage may be mediators involved in cardiovascular diseases, such as systemic arterial hypertension [1].Supporting this notion, areduction in antioxidant bioavailability along withincreased oxidative stres s has been reported in both experimental and human hypertension [2].
Creatine (Cr) supplementation has emerged as a pro- mising adjunct therapy in several pathological conditions [3], including cardiovascular diseases [4,5]. Interestingly, a growing body of experimental and clinical literaturehas suggested that Cr may exert protective effect in dis-eases where exacerbated oxida tive stress plays a detri- mental role (e.g., Huntington’ s disease) [6-8].In fact, invitro experiments have revealed that Cr may possessantioxidant properties by acting as a scavenger of free radicals, such as superoxide anions and peroxynitrite [8,9].
For instance, Cr pre-loading was found to be cyto-protective in different cell cultures with oxidative stres-sors (i.e., H2O2, tBOOH and peroxynitrite) [10].Moreover, Cr may also “indirectly ”attenuate the forma- tion of reactive oxygen species trough the coupling ofCr with ATP into the mitochondria, ultimately resultingin a more efficient mitochondrial respiration and delayed accumulation of ADP f(i.e., the concentration of unbound ADP in the cytoplasm), which has been impli- cated in IMP and subsequently ROS formation [8,11].This latter, in turn, may lead to oxidative stress withformation of chemical products of ROS reactions, suchas oxidised glutathione and lipid hydroperoxides [12].Despite the potential antioxidant capacity of Cr supple-mentation, its effects on oxidative stress and, * Correspondence: gualano@usp.br 1School of Physical Education and Sports, University of São Paulo, Av.

Material and methods Procedures This study was approved by the institution ’se t h i c a l committee and was conducted in accordance with the National Research Council ’s Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male SHR (26 weeks old) were housed under controlled environmental conditions (22°C; 12:12-h light:dark period) with free access tocommercial chow and water.Animals were randomlyallocated into two groups to receive either Cr (n = 8; 5g/kg/d) or placebo (Pl; n = 7; distillated water).Thegroups have similar body mass (Cr = 324.7 ± 41.9 vs.Pl= 325.2 ± 21.6; p = 0.97).Cr monohydrate was adminis-tered by gavage for nine weeks.Forty-eight hours after the intervention, arterial blood pressure and heart rate were invasively measured us ing a catheter inserted into the femoral artery [14].Thereafter, animals were killedby decapitation.
Plasma, heart, carotid artery, plantaris,and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were iso-lated, weighted and deep frozen at -80°C for furtheranalyses. Cardiomyocyte width and cardiac collagendeposition were also assessed by histological analyses, as measures of cardiac remodeli ng [15].Additionally, lipid hydroperoxidation (an important marker of oxidative stress) was determined in the plasma, heart, carotidartery, and skeletal muscles.These aforementionedmethods have been described in details below.Hemodynamic parameters After an intra-peritoneal anesthetic injection (80 mg/kg ketamine and 12 mg/kg xylazi ne, i.p.), a catheter filled with 0.06 mL of saline was inserted into the femoral artery of rats.
Twenty four hours after the catheterinsertion, the arterial cannula was connected to a strain-gauge transducer (Blood Pressure XDCR; Kent Scienti-fic, Torrington, CT, USA), and arterial pressure signalswere recorded over a 30 min period in conscious rats bya microcomputer equipped with an analog-to-digital converter board (WinDaq, 2 kHz, DATAQ, Springfield, OH, USA). The recorded data were analyzed on a beat-to-beat basis to quantify systolic, diastolic and meanarterial pressure, as well as heart rate.Histological analyses Cardiac chambers were fixed by immersion in 4% buf-fered formalin and embedded in paraffin for routinehistologic processing.Sections (4 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for examination by light micro-scopy.Only nucleated cardiac myocytes from areas oftransversely cut muscle fibers were included in the ana-lysis.Quantification of left ventricular fibrosis wasachieved by Sirius red staining.
Cardiac myocyte width and ventricular fibrosis were measured in the LV free wall with a computer assisted morphometric system(Leica Quantimet 500, Cambridge, UK). Lipid hydroperoxidation measurement Lipid hydroperoxidation was assessed since this oxidativestress marker has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anumber of cardiovascular diseases, including arterial hypertension [16,17].Lipid hydroperoxides were evaluated by the ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange technique (FOX2)[18].Plasma, Heart, Carotid Artery, Plantar and EDL sam-ples were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS;100 mmol/L, pH 7.4) and immediately centrifuged at12.000 g for 20 min at 4°C.The homogenate was precipi-tated with trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v) and centrifuged(12.000 g for 20 min at 4°C).Supernatant was mixed with FOX reagent (250 mmol/L ammonium ferrous sulfate, 100 mmol/L xylenol orange, 25 mmol/L H2SO4 and 4 mmol/L BHT in 90% methanol) and incubated at room tempera-ture for 20 min.
The absorbance of the sample was read at560 nm in a spectrophotometer. Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean ± standard error.The dependent variables were tested by unpaired Student ’st test.Cohen ’s d effect size (Cr group minus placebo group divided by the standard deviation pooled) was also calculated for dependent variables.The level of sig-nificance was previously set at p < 0.05.Results As shown in Table 1, there were no significant differ- ences in hemodynamic parameters between groups fol- lowing the intervention.Additionally, no significant differences between groups were shown in heart weight, cardiomyocyte width, andcardiac collagen content (Table 2).Lipid hydroperoxida-tion also remained unchanged in the coronary artery,heart, plasma, plantaris, and EDL (Table 3).
Comments Cr intake failed to attenuate oxidative stress in the car-diovascular system (i.e., heart and artery) as well inother tissues (i.e., plasma and skeletal muscle) in SHR.Furthermore, Cr did not affect either the heart structureor the hemodynamic parameters. Altogether, these datasuggest that Cr supplementation does not exert thera-peutically relevant effects in a model of SHR.Alves et al .Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2012, 9:13 http://www.jissn.com/content/9/1/13Page 2 of 4 It has been speculated that the coupling of Cr with ATP into the mitochondria could attenuate the forma- tion of reactive oxygen species by stimulating ther e s p i r a t i o nr a t ea n dr e d u c i n gt h ef r e ee n e r g yr e q u i r e d for ATP synthesis [8].Furthermore, Cr appears to act as a direct scavenger of radical species in face of oxidativestress [8,9].
These in vitro antioxidant proprieties conferto Cr a possible therapeutic role in diseases in whichoxidative stress is exacerbated and related to pathologi-cal conditions. However, the current results were incontrast to our hypothesis.There are two potentialspeculations for the lack of any “positive ”outcome in this study.First, the arterial blood pressure peaks at 24weeks of age in SHR [13].Therefore, one may assume -despite the lack of a healthy control group - that ourrats displayed severe arterial hypertension.In suchextreme conditions, Cr may be not capable of revertingcardiovascular dysfunctio n.Second, Cr metabolism is divergent among species [19], meaning that the in vitroantioxidant effects of Cr may not be extended to in vivo models.
Further studies with other experimental models of hypertension as well as randomized controlled trialswith humans are required to determine whether Cr sup-plementation can alleviate o xidative stress and cardio- vascular dysfunction in arterial hypertension. In summary, Cr supplementation did not affect oxida- tive stress or cardiovascular parameters in SHR model.Abbreviations ATP: Adenosine triphosphate; Cr: Creatine; EDL: Extensor digitorum longus; SHR: Spontaneously hypertensive rats.Acknowledgements We would like to thank Katt Coelho Mattos and Fabiana Guimarães for theirvaluable technical assistance in this study.We are grateful to FAPESP for thefinancial support.We also thank Ethika ®for providing the supplements.Author details 1School of Physical Education and Sports, University of São Paulo, Av.Prof.Mello Moraes, 65, São Paulo, PO Box 05508-030, Brazil.2Hypertension Unit of Heart Institute, Medical School, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.
