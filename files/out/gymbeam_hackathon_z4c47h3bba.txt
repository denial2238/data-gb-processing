The main purpose was to analyze the bore diameters that satisfythe torsion standards and further analyze the optimal pore and implantationdirection for stabilizing femoral neck fractures. Methods: The MABCS design with bionic holes with a screw diameter of less than 20% met the torsion standard for metal screws.The MABCS was utilized to repairthe femoral neck fracture via Abaqus 6.14 software, which simulated the variousstages of fracture healing to identify the optimal biomechanical environment forbionic hole size (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) and implantation direction (0 °,4 5°,9 0°, and 135°).Results: The stress distribution of the MABCS fracture ﬁxation model is signi ﬁcantly improved with an implantation orientation of 90°.The MABCS with a bionic hole and a screw diameter of 10% provides optimal stressdistribution compared with the bionic cannulated screw with diameters of 5%,15%, and 20%.
In addition, the cannulated screw ﬁxation model with a 10% bionic hole size has optimal bone stress distribution and better internal ﬁxation than the MABCS ﬁxation models with 5%, 15%, and 20% screw diameters. Conclusion: In summary, the MABCS with 10% screw diameter bionic holes has favorable biomechanical characteristics for stabilizing femoral neck fractures.This study provides a biomechanical foundation for further optimization of thebionic cannulated screw.

Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org 01TYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 30 August 2024 DOI10.3389/fbioe.2024.1448527 Introduction With more and more traf ﬁc accidents and an aging population, 1.7 million femoral neck fractures are estimated to occur per yearworldwide, which is approximately 3.4% of all fractures ( Florschutz et al., 2015 ;Major and North, 2016 ;Chen et al., 2017 ;Ding et al., 2024 ).Given the low cost and minimal invasiveness of the procedure, closed reduction and multiple cannulated screws (CSs) are the recommended treatment for young-to-middle femoral neck fractures ( Florschutz et al., 2015;Li and Cole, 2015 ).
Nevertheless, postoperative complications of CSs, including osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) andnonunion, have been reported to reach 50%, which can impact lifequality and increase the economic burden ( Li and Cole, 2015 ). Therefore, new treatment concepts and methods have been proposed to address the treatment dilemma of femoral neck fractures, and the novel con ﬁguration and materials of the cannulated screw structure have been improved.The anatomical structure of the proximal femur and the mechanism of fracture healing are c losely related to the occurrence of postoperative ONFH and nonunion, which is predominantly due tothe complexity of reconstructing the proximal femoral trabecularsystem ( Ding et al., 2021b ).The placement process of internal ﬁxation often damages part of the trabecular bone.In addition, the traditional internal ﬁxation also occupies a considerable intraosseous volume, which hinders the reconstruction of the trabecular bone.
Thus,some scholars suggested that additi onal bionic holes in cannulated screws provide physical space for trabecular bone regeneration aroundinternal ﬁxation, which has improved the biomechanical properties and promotes fracture healing ( Wang et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, abnormal trabecular reconstruction related to the absorption of the surrounding trabeculae occurred due to stress mask ing caused by a large difference in the elastic modulus between convent ional implants and trabeculae ( Li et al., 2021 ).To address these issues, our team proposed the concept of bionic ﬁxation of fractures and design ed a magnesium alloy bionic cannulated screw (MABCS), drawing upon biomechanical principles, imaging data, and clinical research.This approach facilitates trabecularbone growth through bionic holes, restoring bone continuity andpromoting a biphasic healing proce ss in intertrochanteric fractures (Wang et al., 2020 ).
The low elastic modulus of the magnesium alloy signiﬁcantly diminishes the likelihood of bone stress concentration and the incidence of complications such as ONFH ( Zhao et al., 2016 ;Tian et al., 2018 ;Cun et al., 2020 ;Ding et al., 2021b ;Li et al., 2021 ). However, t h e r ei sl i t t l ee v i d e n c eo ft h eo p t i m a lb i o m e c h a n i c a le n v i r o n m e n tf o rt h ebionic hole size and implantation direction.Given the above concept, ﬁnite element analysis was used to determine bionic cannulated scr ews that identify the optimal conﬁguration of bionic holes for stabilizing femoral neck fractures, providing references for the clinical application of MABCSs.Materials and methods This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University.Written informed consent was obtained from the volunteering subject.
Screening diameters and implantation orientations of the bionic cannulated screw for optimal biomechanicalcharacterization of ﬁxed femoral neck fracturesOne healthy male volunteer (height: 170 cm; body weight: 60 kg) was included in this study. The lower extremities were used to scanfor constructing proximal femur models using Mimics 21.0, andthen Geomagic 2013 was used to construct the solid proximal femurmodel.An unstable femoral neck fracture (Pauwel ’s angle of 50 °) was constructed and ﬁxed with a MABCS with bionic holes of a 25% diameter at different directional angles, including 0°,4 5°,9 0°, and 135°, using UG software ( Figures 1 –3).The reference plane was taken as the line from the femoral head to the distal femoral stemand the screw centerline, and the centerline of the bionic hole was setto 0 °to the reference plane.The MABCS was rotated 45°,9 0°, and 135°from the screw centerline to create different torsion models.
Based on the above experimental results, the implantation direction was set as 90°. Bionic holes with 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% screw diameters were designed.FIGURE 1 Boundary conditions of the fracture ﬁxation models.Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org 02Cui et al.10.3389/fbioe.2024.1448527 The above models were imported into HyperMesh 2013 to construct a C3D4 tetrahedral mesh, which was subsequently imported into Abaqus software.All the models were assigned linear elasticity and isotropy with the corre sponding modulus of elasticity and Poisson ’s ratio as reference ( Ding et al., 2021b ;Li et al., 2021 )(Table 1 ).The relationship between the screw thread/bone and cortical screw/ bone was set as tied.In addition, other bone –screw and bone –bone interfaces were assumed to have a surface-to-surface contact relationwith a friction coef ﬁcient of 0.3 ( Ding et al., 2021a ).
The joint load was set to 1,800 N (approximately three times the body weight) to simulate the single-leg stance of the human body, and the distal femur was set to 0 degrees of freedom in six directions ( Li et al., 2019 ). The three- dimensional proximal femoral FEM, whose convergence analysis andeffectiveness have been veri ﬁed in previous studies, was used in this study ( Ding et al., 2022 ;Ding et al., 2023 ;Zhang et al., 2023 )(Figure 1 ).Simulation of the fracture healing process According to the experimental design, different contact relations were set up to simulate fracture healing periods.These periods weredivided into three categories: fracture, part-healing, and fullyhealing.At the initial fracture stage, the contact relationship between the fracture surfaces was set to sliding and separation to simulate the compression reduction of the fracture.Furthermore, the 3-month and 12-month post-fracture models, respectively, wereused to simulate bone ingrowth in this study.
The cancellous bonecontact relationship was set as tied without slip or displacement, inthe part-healing period (postoperative 3 months). In addition, noslip or displacement of the cortical and cancellous bones weresimulated (postoperative 12 months).The von Mises anddisplacement distributions of femoral neck fractures ﬁxed with different-diameter cannulated screws at different stages of fracture healing were collected.Results Optimal implantation orientation of bionic cannulated screws for femoral neck fracture ﬁxation Under axial load, the peak von Mises stresses of the MABCS ﬁxation model with a torsion angle of 90°were 278.1, 248.8, and FIGURE 2 Fracture ﬁxation models of the MABCS with different implantation directions.(A),0°;(B),4 5°;(C),9 0°; and (D),1 3 5°.FIGURE 3 Fracture ﬁxation models of the MABCS with different pore sizes.Bionic holes with 5% (A),1 0 % (B), 15% (C), and 20% (D)screw diameters.Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org 03Cui et al.

These values represented 84.6% –98.7% of the other torsion angle MABCS ﬁxation model for the fracture period, 98.4% –99.2% for the part- healing period, and 32.0% –87.6% for the fully-healing period.Additionally, the maximum displacement with a torsion angle of 90°was 3.9, 3.8, and 3.7 mm for the three periods, which is 99.0% – 100.2% of the torsion angle ﬁxation model.The implantation direction of bionic holes had no signi ﬁcant impact on the stability of fracture ﬁxation during the healing process in the MABCS ( Figures 4 –7).Optimal bionic hole size for femoral neck fracture ﬁxation Under axial load, the bone and internal ﬁxation peak von Mises stresses of the MABCS wit h a bionic hole diameter of 10% at the early fracture, part-healing period, and fully healing periodwere 83.3 and 106.6 MPa, 69.6 and 23.9 MPa, and 65.9 and 23.0 MPa, respectively.
These values represented 98.7% –101.5% and 98.2% –100.2% of other aperture size MABCS ﬁxation models for the fracture period, 98.8% –99.4% and 27.6% –38.7% for the part-healing period, and 54.5% –99.7% and 55.0% –96.4% for the fully healing period. Furthermore, femoral neck fracture ﬁxation stability gradually increased with the bionic hole enlargement(Figures 8 –11).Discussion This study revealed that the optimal stress distribution for MABCS ﬁxation of femoral neck fractures is achieved when the bore size is 10% of the screw diameter at 90°to the direction of implantation.The results provide biomechanical guidance forpotential clinical applications of bionic cannulated screws in thetreatment of femoral neck fractures.FIGURE 4 The von Mises stress and displacement distribution of 25%-bionic hole-diameter MABCS ﬁxation models with different implantation directions at a non-healed fracture.(A),0°;(B),4 5°;(C),9 0°;a n d (D),1 3 5°.

First, the increase in pore size has reduced the maximum displacement of the femoral neck fracture ﬁxation models with a torsion angle of 90°,w h i c h results in the gradual enhancement of fracture stiffness. This may be related to the fact that an increase in the trabecular reconstructionvolume enhances the internal ﬁxation of holding forces, improving fracture ﬁxation stability.Second, the biomechanical properties of the MABCS deteriorated with increasin g bionic hole diameter.However, the biomechanical properties of bionic cannulated screws with a screw diameter of less than 20% met th e criteria.The MABCS with a 10% bionic hole size (650 μm) for treating femoral neck fractures resulted in the best internal ﬁxation and bone stress distribution, as veri ﬁed by animal experiments (500 –650 µm).
The 10% bionic hole size (650 μm) provides an optimal balance between s tability and stress distribution, as well as a favorable biomechanical environment for trabecularreconstruction (Collins et al.). The study posits that the addition ofa bionic hole may facilitate the reco nstruction of trabecular bone; however, it may also compromise the mechanical properties of the screw, potentially increasing the risk of ﬁxation failure ( Li et al., 2021 ).It can be seen that there is an optimal interval between the maintenance ofthe trabecular bone reconstruction and the stress distribution in theMABCS ﬁxation model.The results demonstrate that the main reason for the superior stress distribution of the bionic cannulated screw with a 10% screw diameter is due to its dia meter being the most appropriate for this particular model, which is consistent with the results of animal experiments ( Collins et al., 2021 ).
Finally, the direction of screw implantation can also affect the biomechanical properties of theMABCS fracture ﬁxation model, and the stress concentration is signiﬁcantly improved in all cases with a torsion angle of 90 °.T h e upper and lower portions of the bionic hole can bear the proximalfemoral load and effectively transfer the load to the femoral lateralcortex. Our ﬁndings may be similar to those of the previous literature, suggesting that the requirements of stability and improved retention are c o n d u c i v et ob i o n i cs c r e w sw i t hat o r s i o na n g l eo f9 0 °(Qi et al., 2013 ).In addition to the biomechanical properties, the bionic hole provides a physical space for fracture healing factors, thus improvingthe fracture ﬁxation of the cannulated screw.Lv et al.designed a side-hole structure cannulated screw loaded with a recombinanthuman BMP-2-targeted slow-release system that promoted bonetissue regeneration ( Houcheng et al., 2014 ).
Hofmann-Fliri et al.attempted to design side holes on a cannulated screw and then injected bone cement into the cannulated screw through the end of the nail after implantation, which formed a contact surface with thebone at the bottom side holes, enhanced screw implantation stabilityand reduced the displacement and dislodgement of cannulatedscrews in the postoperative period ( Hofmann-Fliri et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, the study identi ﬁed the biomechanical references for this type of internal ﬁxation, including embedding direction, bionic hole number distribution, pore diameter, and other key factors.However, the above treatments overcome the volume occupancy effects and still fail to reduce the existing postoperativecomplications due to the stress masking effect and the dif ﬁculty in removing the conventional porous materials.
In response to this,the MABCS was designed for the treatment of femoral neck fractureswith the aim of improving stress concentration, reducingcomplications, and providing physical space for the healingfactors. The results of this study show that the stress on the bone and internal ﬁxation was signi ﬁcantly reduced during the MABCS degradation , which provided a good biomechanical environmentfor ingrowth.This study did not directly describe the relationshipbetween MABCS degradation and bone ingrowth, includingdegradation products, thread shape, pitch, and surface roughness,and further studies are needed.Previous studies have demonstrated that the MABCS improves stress distribution and reduces stress-masking and volume- occupancy effects while maintaining stability ( Xue et al., 2022 ).
Based on the above studies, this study investigated the design of theMABCS in accordance with torsion standards and investigated theoptimal bionic hole size and implantation direction to provide abiomechanical basis for the clinical application of the MABCS forfemoral neck fractures. Compared to other medical metal materials,magnesium alloys are closer to human bone in terms of Young ’s modulus and density, have better biocompatibility, and are less susceptible to degradation ( Nabiyouni et al., 2018 ;Parai and Bandyopadhyay-Ghosh, 2019 ).In addition, the degradation of magnesium alloys releases magnesium ions, which can reduce theinﬂammatory response, promote osteogenic healing, and accelerate the process of fracture healing.
At present, magnesium alloys havebeen used in rabbit ulna and mandible fracture models, respectively,indicating good fracture healing ( Witte et al., 2007 ;Sun et al., 2016 ; FIGURE 7 The von Mises stress (A)and displacement distribution (B)of 25%-bionic hole-diameter MABCS models with different implanted directions for three periods. Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org 06Cui et al.10.3389/fbioe.2024.1448527 Chen et al., 2022 ).In addition, magnesium alloys have been partially applied to the human body.Magnesium alloy nails are comparableto titanium nails in randomized controlled clinical trials for bunions(Windhagen et al., 2013 ).Furthermore, magnesium alloys have beenused in femoral head necrosis, their clinical ef ﬁcacy is reliable, and compared with traditional surgery, the procedure is simple andshort, and the magnesium alloy screw can degrade by itself ( Cheng et al., 2022 ).
From the perspective of clinical practice, magnesium FIGURE 8 The von Mises stress and displacement distribution of MABCS ﬁxation models with different pore sizes at a non-healed fracture with a torsion angle of 90°. Stress distribution of bone (A)and implants (B).Displacement of fracture models (C).Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org 07Cui et al.10.3389/fbioe.2024.1448527 alloys have shown unique advantages in fracture treatment and bone defect repair as a potential biodegradable metal material ( Chen et al., 2014 ).They have a similar density and elastic modulus to human bone, which helps reduce the stress-shielding effect and promotebone healing ( Kamrani and Fleck, 2019 ).
Clinical trials of magnesium alloy screws have been conducted, demonstratingfavorable biocompatibility and mechanical properties, as well asuniform and predictable degradation characteristics ( Saris et al., FIGURE 9 The von Mises stress and displacement distribution of MABCS ﬁxation models with different pore sizes at a partly healed fracture with a torsion angle of 90°. Stress distribution of bone (A)and implants (B).Displacement of fracture models (C).Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org 08Cui et al.10.3389/fbioe.2024.1448527 2000 ;Lee et al., 2016 ).Using magnesium alloy bone nails can avoid the need for secondary surgery, reducing the economic and physicalburden on patients ( Hou et al., 2019 ).
However, it is still necessary to consider the degradation rate to meet the needs of fracture healing indifferent populations and to ensure its safety and effectiveness.Finite element analysis was used to simulate the degradation kinetics of screw materials and the fracture healing process tosimulate the biomechanical properties of MABCS ﬁxation of femoral neck fractures. According to the previous literature(Ding et al., 2021b ;Li et al., 2021 ), we selected three time nodes FIGURE 10 The von Mises stress and displacement distribution of MABCS ﬁxation models with different pore sizes at a fully healed fracture with a torsion angle of 90°.Stress distribution of bone (A)and implants (B).Displacement of fracture models (C).Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org 09Cui et al.10.3389/fbioe.2024.1448527 in the fracture healing process as fracture separation period, trabecular bone healing period, and complete healing.
The time nodes were 0 months, 3 months, and 12 months, respectively, andthe corresponding elastic moduli of the degradable magnesium alloywere 45 MPa, 36 MPa, and 9 MPa, respectively ( Cun et al., 2020 ). In addition, 3 months after fracture healing, we added trabecular boneingrowth to simulate trabecular bone reconstruction.As a result, theﬁnite element simulation, the fracture surface contact properties of different periods, the MABCS elastic modulus, and the trabecular bone ingrowth, in turn, changed the complete process of the simulated MABCS ﬁxed femoral neck fracture.This study has several shortcom ings.First, the study used a ﬁnite element analysis to simulate the MABCS ﬁxation of a femoral neck fracture, but there was no experiment withmagnesium alloy, which may have had a potential in ﬂuence on the reliability of the experiment.This study did notconsider the above experimental changes, which may affect the results of this study.
Second, the material properties of the MABCS used in this study were obtained from the previousliterature, and the degradation rate of the MABCS was not tested,which may affect the reliability of the experimental results.Finally, the construction metho d of the fracture model in this study was planar, and the real diff erences in fracture morphology m a ya f f e c tt h er e l i a b i l i t yo ft h ef r a c t u r em o d e l( Zhan et al., 2024 ). In conclusion, the MABCS with a 10% bionic pore diameter implanted in a 90 °orientation can meet the stability of early fracture ﬁxation with optimal stress distribution and provide a good biomechanical environment for trabecular bone reconstruction.The results of this study can provide a biomechanical referencebasis for the clinical application of bionic magnesium alloys.
