Methods: Twenty one endurance-trained males perfor med, in a double-blind fashion, two constant-load exercise tests to exhaustion at 63 ± 5% O2 max in the heat (ambient temperature: 30.3 ± 0.5 °C, relative humidity: 70 ± 2%) before and after 7 days of Cr (20 g·d-1 Cr + 140 g·d-1 glucose polymer) or placebo (Plc) (160 g·d-1 glucose polymer) supplementation. Results: 3-way interaction has shown that Cr supplem entation reduced rectal temperature, heart rate, ratings of perceived leg fatigue ( P < 0.05), plasma free-tryptophan (Trp) ( P < 0.01) and free- Trp:tyrosine ratio ( P < 0.01) but did not influence the ratio of free-Trp:large neutral amino acids or contribute in improving endurance performance (Plc group, n = 10: 50.4 ± 8.4 min vs.51.2 ± 8.0 min, P > 0.05; Cr group, n = 11: 47.0 ± 4.7 min vs.49.7 ± 7.5 min, P > 0.05).
However, after dividing the participants into "responders" and "non-res ponders" to Cr, based on their intramuscular Cr uptake, performance was higher in the "responder s" relative to "non-res ponders" group (51.7 ± 7.4 min vs.47.3 ± 4.9 min, p < 0.05). Conclusion: although Cr influenced key modulators of brain 5-HT and DA function and reduced various thermophysiological parameters which al l may have contributed to the reduced effort perception during exercise in the heat, performa nce was improved only in the "responders" to Cr supplementation.The present results may also suggest the demanding of the pre-experimental identification of the participan ts into "responders" and "non-r esponders" to Cr supplementation before performing the main experimentation.
Othe rwise, the possibility of the type II error may be enhanced.Published: 30 September 2008 Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2008, 5:14 doi:10.1186/1550-2783-5-14Received: 7 April 2008 Accepted: 30 September 2008 This article is available from: http://www.jissn.com /content/5/1/14 © 2008 Hadjicharalambous et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

V Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2008, 5:14 http://www.jissn.com/content/5/1/14 Page 2 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)Background It is well established that perception of effort is elevated and exercise performance is markedly impaired in hotenvironments but the precise mechanism(s) of fatiguehave yet to be determined [1]. The previous observation ofthe maintenance of carbohydrate reserves at exhaustion[2] in conjunction with no impairment in the capacity of skeletal muscle to generate force during exercise with hyperthermia [3] may preclude peripheral factors as themain cause of fatigue during exercise in the heat.Previ-ously, Nielsen and colleagues [4] proposed a core temper-ature increase to approximately 39.6°C as a critical factorin the reduction of central neural motivation and exercise performance.
In subsequent studies, it was proposed that fatigue during exercise in the heat may occur at a criticalbrain temperature, through a reduction in cerebral bloodflow [5,6] and brain glucose levels [7,8]. However, theexact mechanism(s) for these hyperthermia-inducedeffects and/or how thermal stress may affect brain neuro-transmission during exercise in the heat are presently unknown.Several studies have attributed the changes in body tem- perature [e.g., [9,10]], the higher effort perception andimpaired exercise tolerance during exercise in the heat toevents localized within the central nervous system, and in particular, the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems [11-13].Soares et al.[12,13] for example, suggested thatcore body temperature was elevated and exercise perform-ance was diminished following pre-exercise intracerebrov-enticular injection of tryptohan (Trp: i.e.a 5-HTprecursor) in rats.Lin et al.
[10] also observed that when hypothalamic serotonin (5-HT) levels were increased in the rat by administration of Fluoxetine (i.e. 5-HT reuptakeinhibitor) and 5-hydoxytryptophan (i.e.a 5-HT precur-sor) there was an increase in metabolic heat productionwith a concomitant reduction in heat loss.In addition,Bridge et al.[14], using a combined Buspirone (i.e.5-HT 1A agonists/dopamine D2 antagonist) and Pindolol (5-HT1A antagonist) neuroendocrine challenge, found thedopaminergic-induced prolactin (Prl) response to be sig-nificantly correlated both with submaximal exercise dura-tion at 35°C, rectal temperature and the rate oftemperature rise.They concluded that high activity of thedopaminergic pathways in the hypothalamus was a pre- dictor of exercise tolerance in the heat.
More recently, Watson et al., [15] examined the effect of the dualdopamine/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (bupropion)on performance, thermoregulation and hormonalresponses during exercise in the heat (30°C) and in tem-perate (18°C) conditions. They found that although per- ception of effort and thermal stress were not different between bupropion and placebo trails during exercise inthe heat, exercise performance was enhanced by acutebupropion administration.No such effect was seen attemperate conditions.These authors suggested that bupropion may diminish inhibitory signals arising from the CNS to discontinue exercise due to hyperthermia ena-bling participants to increase performance.Creatine (Cr) is abundant in muscles and the brain and after phosphorylation used as an energy source for adeno- sine triphosphate synthesis [16].
Cr for example, was found to improve performance during high intensity exer-cise by increasing intramuscular Cr and phosphocreatine(PCr) levels [17] and by accelerating the resynthesis rate ofPCr [18]. However, although the role of Cr in protectingmuscle fatigue during high intensity exercise was exten- sively studied and understood, its role in preventing ther- mal-stress and central fatigue developments was not.Crfor example, has been shown to elevate total body water(TBW) [19,20], enhance body thermal tolerance, reducecore temperature and heart rate and improve performanceduring exercise in the heat [21].However, whether theseeffects of Cr on thermoregulation and exercise perform- ance were due to better maintenance of increase TBW or central neural effects is presently unknown.It was foundfor example, that oral Cr supplementation improvedmental function and reduced mental fatigue by increasingthe oxygen utilization in the brain [16].
In addition, sev-eral pharmacological studies suggested that oral Cr sup- plementation has been found to increase brain DA synthesis in the substantia nigra of mice by protectingagainst striatal dopamine depletion [22] and/or byenhancing tyrosine hydroxylase activation (the rate-limit-ing enzyme of brain DA biosynthesis) [23,24]. However,no studies were examined so far the responses of periph- eral modulators and indices of brain 5-HT and DA func- tion during exercise in the heat after Cr supplementation,The purpose therefore of the present experiment was toexamine the effects of oral Cr, used as a physiologicalmodel to enhance body thermal tolerance, on perceptualresponses and on central fatigue development by measur- ing peripheral modulators and indices of brain 5-HT and DA metabolic interaction during exercise in the heat intrained humans.
Methods Participants Twenty one endurance-trained males volunteers (Table 1) provided written informed consent for the study, which was approved by the Glasgow University Research EthicalCommittee. Participants were recruited from local athlet-ics and cycling clubs and none were acclimatized to exer-cise in the heat.Participants eligibility was initiallyassessed by interview.No participant had a history of car- diovascular or respiratory disease and/or evidence of mus- culoskeletal injury.All participants were Cr free for at least8 weeks prior to the study.The investigators did not revealprior to interview that participants would be excluded if Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2008, 5:14 http://www.jissn.com/content/5/1/14 Page 3 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)they had supplemented with Cr in the 8 weeks preceding the study.One participant from the placebo (Plc) grouphad previously supplemented with Cr.
No Cr was detectedin the baseline urine samples of any participant. Experimental design Participants initially underwent a continuous incremental test to volitional exhaustion in order to determine the lac- tate threshold (LT), maximum oxygen consumption ( O2 max) and the maximal work rate (WRmax).Following the maximal incremental exercise test, participants visited the laboratory on at least two separate occasions in order tobecome familiar with the exercise protocol and experimen-tal procedures, in addition to establishing a suitable workrate (WR) that would elicit fatigue in 40–60 min.This was achieved by setting the WR at 20% Δ (i.e., 20% of the dif- ference between the O2 at the LT and O2 max) during the initial familiarization session and, where necessary, adjust- ing the WR for subsequent trials to achieve the desiredduration.This intensity of exercise was chosen to avoidfatigue occurring as a result of muscle glycogen depletion[2].
Following the familiarization period (at least twofamiliarization trails were carried out identical to the exper- imental trails with exception of complete blood collec- tions), participants were matched for body mass and wererandomized, in a double-blind fashion, to receive either Cror Plc trials. Participants performed one constant-load exer-cise test to volitional exhaustion pre-supplementation andone post-supplementation.The first test was conducted atleast 48 hrs after the final familiarization trial.The supple-mentation period for both groups started on the day after the first test and finished the day before the second test.Supplementation protocol Cr supplementation (Creatamax 300, Maximuscle Ltd., Watford, UK) consisted of 22.8 g·d-1 Cr·H2O (equivalentto 5 g Cr × 4 daily) and 35 g of glucose polymer (Maxim, Geffen, Holland) made up in 500 mls of warm to hotwater for 7 days taken at equal intervals throughout theday.
This protocol has been shown to increase resting muscle PCr levels within 5 days [17]. Each supplementa- tion was freshly made prior to consumption in order toprevent any degredation of Cr to creatinine (Crn).The Plcgroup consumed 160 g·d -1 of glucose polymer (40 g × 4 daily) for 7 days, prepared and administered in an identi-cal fashion to the Cr supplement.Both supplements had similar taste, texture and appearance and were placed in generic packets to ensure double-blind administration.Participants otherwise followed their normal diet buteliminated caffeine and caffeine-containing foodsthroughout the experimental period to minimize the pos-sible inhibitory effects of caffeine on the ergogenic effect of Cr.At the end of the study all participants gave verbal assurance that they had complied with these instructions.Procedures All exercise tests were carried out between 18:00 and20:00 hr.
Participants reported to the laboratory on the day of testing after a standardized meal and having refrained from alcohol and strenuous exercise the daybefore. The participant's left hand and forearm wereimmersed in water at 42–44°C for fifteen minutes inorder to allow for arterialization of the venous blood [25].Following this, a 21 G cannula was introduced into asuperficial vein on the dorsal surface of the heated hand and a resting blood sample (10 ml) obtained.The venous cannula was kept patent by a slow (c.0.5 ml·min -1) infu- sion of isotonic saline between samples.The participantwas transferred to the climatic chamber (ambient temper-ature of 30.3 ± 0.5°C with a relative humidity of 70 ± 2%and air velocity of approximately 3.6 m·sec -1) and remained seated on the cycle ergometer for a further 5 min.Participants were then instructed to begin 5 min ofunloaded cycling before another blood sample wasobtained.
After 5 min of unloaded cycling, the WR wasincreased in a "single step" to the predetermined WR andV V VTable 1: Physical characteristics of the two groups of participants.

Participants exercised at the same WR for both experiments (i.e., 16 ± 11% Δ or 63 ± 5% O2 max, 225 ± 26 watts).
Exhaustion was defined as the point atwhich the participant could no longer maintain the pedalcadence above 60 rpm for a second occasion (at around15 seconds) after an initial verbal warning from the inves- tigators. Blood samples were obtained at 5 min intervals throughout exercise and at exhaustion.Time to exhaus-tion was recorded but withheld from the participant untilall exercise tests had been completed.Blood treatment and analysis Blood (10 ml) was drawn into dry syringes and dispensedinto tubes containing K 3EDTA and the remainder into tubes containing no anticoagulant.Duplicate aliquots(400 μL) of whole blood from the K3EDTA tube were rap- idly deproteinised in 800 μL of ice cold 0.3 mol·L-1 per- chloric acid.After centrifugation, the supernatant wasused for the measurement of glucose and lactate using standard enzymatic methods with spectrophotometric detection (Mira Plus, ABX Diagnostics, Montpellier,France).
Some of the uncoagulated blood was also usedfor the measurement of haemoglobin (Hb) (cyanmethae-moglobin method, Sigma Chemical Company Ltd., Dor-set, UK) and packed cell volume (PCV) (conventional microhematocrit (Hct) method). All blood analyses were carried out in duplicate with the exception of PCV, whichwas analysed in triplicate.Plasma volume changes werecalculated from changes in Hb and PCV relative to initialbaseline values [26].An aliquot of whole blood from theK 3EDTA tubes was centrifuged and the plasma obtained was separated and used for the measurement of free fatty acids (FFA) (colorimetric method, Roche DiagnosticsGmbH, Germany) and concentrations of amino acidsincluding total and free Trp, tyrosine (Tyr) and large neu-tral amino acids (LNAA) by HPLC using fluorescencedetection and pre-column derivitisation with 18 o-phtha- laldehyde (Hypersil Amino acid method, ThermoHyper- sil-Keystone, Runcorn, UK).The LNAA includes Tyr,phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine and valine.
Free-Trpwas separated from protein-bound Trp by filtering plasmathrough 10,000 NMWL 'nominal molecular weight limit'cellulose filters (Ultrafree MC filters, Millipore Corpora-tion, USA) during centrifugation at 5000 g for 60 min at 4°C. Prior to centrifugation, filters were filled with a 95% O 2 – 5% CO2 mixture in order to stabilize pH.The blood in tubes without anticoagulant was allowed to clot andthen centrifuged; the serum collected was used for themeasurement of prolactin (Prl) by sandwich magneticseparation assay (Technicon Immuno 1 System, Bayer Diagnostics, Newbury, UK).Calculations The thermal gradient was calculated as rectal temperature (Trec) – skin temperature (Tsk).The calculation ofweighted mean Tsk [Tsk = 0.3 (Tchest + Tarm) + 0.2 (Tthigh + Tcalf)] was according to the method of Ramanathan [27].Mean body temperature (Tb) was calculated at each time point as 0.87Trec+0.13Tsk [28].Estimated Cr uptake Participants completed 8 separate 24 hr urine collections.
The collection began on the day preceding supplementa- tion (baseline), and then continued through the 7 days ofsupplementation. The urine volume for each 24 hr periodwas measured and mixed thoroughly, with a representa-tive 20 mL sample being stored at -20°C for subsequentanalysis (ABX Mira Plus Spectrophotometer, ABX Diag- nostics, UK) of Cr and Crn concentration, using a spectro- photometric enzymatic Crn Kit (MPR1 – Kit no.839434,Roche Diagnostics Ltd., East Sussex, UK).Estimated Cruptake was calculated by subtracting the total Cr excreted,corrected for Crn excretion, from the total amount supple-mented per day.Estimated intramuscular [Cr] (mmol·kg - 1·dry weight muscle) was calculated based on an esti- mated muscle mass amounting to 40% of body mass and average muscle water approximating 77% of wet weight[29].Statistical analysis Data were expressed as the mean ± SD following a test for the normality of distribution.
For data that violated the assumptions for parametric analyses (i.e. equality of vari-ance and normality of distribution) non-parametric anal-yses was carried out and these data were expressed as themedian (Interquartile range: IQR).Statistical analysis wascarried out using a mixed 3-way ANOVA (Group × Pre- and Post- supplementation × Time) with repeated meas- ures on the last two factors.A subsequent 2-way ANOVAwith repeated measures was performed when there was amain effect on Group, Pre-Post supplementation, or inter-action.Two-sample t-test (between treatment effect, i.e., magnitude of change ( Δ) in the Cr group vs.Δ in the Plc group) and student t-test (within treatment effect, i.e., Pre- vs.Post-supplementation) were performed if a main treat-ment or interaction effect was observed.For non-paramet-ric data, Friedman two-way ANOVA (followed byWilcoxon test) and Mann-Whitney tests were used forpaired and unpaired data, respectively.
Pearson productmoment r and Spearman rho correlation analyses for par- ametric and non-parametric data respectively were used to assess the relationship between selected variables. Corre-lation analysis was performed for each time point sepa-rately.Statistical significance was a priori at p < 0.05.Results Physiological responses, anthropometrics and performance data Relative to the Plc group, Cr supplementation increased intracellular water (ICW), TBW and body mass (Table 1) Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2008, 5:14 http://www.jissn.com/content/5/1/14 Page 5 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)and reduced rectal temperature (Trec), mean body temper- ature (Tb) (Figure 1), heart rate (HR), sweat rate and rat- ings of perceived leg fatigue (Figure 2) (3-way interaction; p < 0.05).
However, Cr did not influence skin temperature(T skin) (Figure 1), total sweat loss, changes in plasma vol- ume, blood [glucose] and [lactate], O2, carbon dioxide production ( CO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), minute ventilation ( E) and perception of breathlessness (Figure 2). Endurance performance was not different between and within Plc group and Cr groups, as a whole(Plc: 50.4 ± 8.4 min vs.51.2 ± 8.0 min, p < 0.05; Cr group:47.0 ± 4.7 min vs.49.7 ± 7.5 min, p > 0.05).However, after dividing the participants into "responders" and "non-responders" to Cr supplementation based on theirintramuscular Cr uptake [29,30], performance increasedin the "responders" relative to "non-responders" to Crgroup (51.7 ± 7.4 min vs.47.3 ± 4.9 min, p < 0.05).Five out of the eleven participants in the Cr group reported thatthey found the post-supplementation trial easier, whiletwo out of the ten participants in the Plc group rated the post-supplementation trial to be easier.
No side effects were reported following Cr and/or Plc supplementations. Estimated Cr uptake Estimated Cr uptake was calculated by subtracting the total Cr excreted, corrected for the increase in Crn excretion, from the total amount supplemented per day.Estimatedintramuscular Cr (mmol·kg -1·dry weight muscle) was cal- culated based on an estimated muscle mass amounting to40% of body mass and average muscle water approximat-ing 77% of wet weight [31].In the Cr group, Crn excretion increased from 1.4 ± 0.4 g·day -1 pre-supplementation to 2.4 ± 1.0 g·day-1 on the final day of supplementation.There was no increase in Crn excretion in the placebo group(1.5 ± 0.4 g·day -1 to 1.4 ± 0.4 g·day-1).Cr excretion increased from 8.7 ± 3.7 g·day-1 pre-supplementation to 17.4 ± 1.9 g·day-1; no Cr was detected in the urine of the placebo group.
Estimated Cr uptake was maximal on the first day of Cr supplementation [10.4 ± 3.7 g, 56 ± 18%being retained] and was lowest on the final day [2.9 ± 1.9g, 13 ± 9% being retained]. The total amount of Cr retainedover the supplementation period was 39 ± 14 g, with anestimated increase in intramuscular Cr of 45 ± 15mmol·kg -1·dry weight muscle.Based on these estimates, 3 participants were classified as "non-responders" [22 ± 3 mmol·kg-1·dry weight muscle] and the remaining 8 partic- ipants were classified as "responders" (53 ± 5 mmol·kg- 1·dry weight muscle) as previously described [29].Plasma amino acids, prolactin and free fatty acids There were no significant differences between Plc and Cr groups in plasma total [Trp], [Tyr], [large neutral aminoacids] (LNAA) (Table 2), total [Trp]:[LNAA] ratio, total [Trp]:[Tyr] ratio, free-[Trp]:LNAA ratio and free-[Trp]:[Tyr] ratio (Table 3).
The Δ plasma total [Trp], [Tyr] and [LNAA] and the ratios of total [Trp]:[LNAA], total [Trp]:[Tyr] andfree-[Trp]:[LNAA] were also not different between thegroups. However, plasma free-[Trp] was significantlylower in the post-Cr supplementation trial ( χ 2 = 33.909, df = 5, p < 0.01) and in the "responders" ( χ2 = 25.786, df = 5, p < 0.01) when compared to the pre-supplementationtrial (Table 2).The Δ free-[Trp] was also significantly lower during exercise in the Cr group ( χ 2 = 15.881, df = 1, p < 0.05) and in the "responders" ( χ2 = 14.582, df = 1, p < 0.05) when compared with Δ Plc group.In "responders", the plasma free-[Trp]:[Tyr] ratio was significantly lower at rest and during exercise post-Cr, relative to the pre-supple-mentation trial, ( χ 2 = 13.071, df = 5, p < 0.05) (Table 3).In addition, there was a tendency for Δ free-[Trp]:[Tyr] ratio to be significantly lower in the "responders" groupwhen compared with Plc group ( p = 0.071).
[LNAA] (Table 2), free-[Trp]:[LNAA] ratio, total [Trp]:[LNAA] ratio, and total [Trp]:[Tyr] ratio (Table 3) were not differ- ent between pre- and post-supplementation trials in bothPlc and Cr groups as well as in the "responders". Plasma[Prl] was not different between the Plc group and the Crgroup as a whole and between pre- and post-supplemen-tation trials in both Plc and Cr groups (Table 4).In all tri- als, [Prl] increased significantly over time when compared to resting levels.The Δ plasma [Prl] was also not different between the groups.Plasma [FFA] was not differentbetween Plc and Cr groups or between pre- and post-Crsupplementation trials (Table 4).Correlation analysis There were no significant correlations between plasmafree-[Trp] and T rec, between free-[Trp] and RPE, between free-[Trp] and plasma [FFA], between Trec and [Prl], and between free-[Trp] and [Prl], when examined for eachtime-point separately.
Discussion It has been previously shown that Cr increased waterretention [20], enhanced body thermal tolerance [21] andimproved endurance performance during exercise in theheat [32] but the mechanism of these Cr-induced effectshave not been extensively studied. In the present experi- ment Cr was used as a "vehicle" in an attempt to reduce thermal stress and examine the responses of peripheralmodulators and indices of brain 5-HT and DA function, inassociation with effort perception during exercise in theheat.The significant observations of the present experi-ment were the effectiveness of Cr to reduce perception of leg muscular fatigue and lower plasma free-[Trp] and free- [Trp]:[Tyr] ratio.
In addition, although these responseshave not contributed in enhancing endurance perform-ance in the whole Cr group, after distinguishing the par-ticipants into "responders" and "non-responders" to CrV V V Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2008, 5:14 http://www.jissn.com/content/5/1/14 Page 6 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)based on their intramuscular Cr uptake [29] performance was improved in the "responders" to Cr group (51.7 ± 7.4min vs. 47.3 ± 4.9 min, p = 0.031).

Previous studies have attributed the changes in body tem- perature [9,10], the higher effort perception and impairedendurance performance during exercise in the heat toevents localized within the serotonergic and dopaminer- gic systems [11-14]. Recently, for example, 5-HT precursor drugs were found to elevate body heat storage by increas-ing metabolic heat production with a concomitant reduc-tion in heat loss [10], and subsequently to reduce exerciseperformance in the heat [12].On the other hand, highhypothalamic dopaminergic activity has been shown to be a reasonable predictor of exercise tolerance during pro- longed submaximal exercise in the heat [14].In thepresent experiment, participants who had supplementedwith Cr reported significantly lower thermal stress and rat-ings of perceived leg fatigue.These may suggest that they were able to discern the benefit of this putative thermal- stress reduction strategy.
The increased hydration status, observed in the present study, seems to be a reasonable contributor to the reduc-tion in effort perception during exercise in the heat fol-lowing Cr supplementation. However, the similar plasmavolume and total sweat rate results in association with no differences in blood metabolites and cardiorespiratory responses observed between trials may augment the pos-sibility that the reduction in participantive fatigue is par-tially due to the lowered plasma free-[Trp] observed in theCr group and subsequently to the lower brain 5:HT syn-thesis.It has been suggested, for example, that a high brain [5-HT]:[DA] ratio increases effort perception (i.e.central fatigue) during prolonged exercise while a low [5-HT]:[DA] ratio may favour increased arousal and centralneural motivation [33].

[15] who found that adual dopamine/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor,enhanced exercise performance in the heat but not in tem-perate conditions. In addition, it has been shown that DA microinjections into the hypothalamus and substantia nigra of the rat produced hypothermia through anincrease in brain [DA] [34,35].This notion was recentlysupported by Lieberman et al.[36] who observed that L-Tyr supplementation, used as the primary brain catecho-lamine precursor, was able to increase brain DA and non-epinephrine levels contributing to the reduction in body heat-storage in rats that were exposed in hot environment (41°C).Nybo et al.[8] however, found that brain uptake of Trp and Tyr as well as brain DA release were not affected byhyperthermia, failing therefore to support the classic "5- HT-central fatigue hypothesis" [37]; and also the involve- ment of brain DA function in thermoregulation duringexercise in the heat.
They suggested that brain glycogendepletion may have contributed to central fatigue duringexercise in the heat. However, the results presented by these authors do not preclude the involvement of modu-lators of brain 5-HT function in central fatigue since a cor-relation was found between arterial free-[Trp] and brainTrp uptake [8].Brain Trp uptake for example, has been shown on numerous occasions to be the rate-limiting step of 5-HT synthesis [38], thus an involvement of 5-HT dur-ing exercise in the heat as classically proposed cannot beexcluded.It should be noted that brain 5-HT was notmeasured in the study by Nybo et al.[8].Consequently,the finding of a lower plasma free-Trp:Tyr ratio (and byextrapolation a lower 5-HT:DA ratio since both precursors share the same L-system transport across the blood brain barrier [39]) may have contributed to reducing thermalstress and to attenuating effort perception following Crsupplementation.
It is noted that no such response wasobserved in Plc trials. On the other hand, it seems to be unreasonable to suggest that the lower plasma free-[Trp] and free-Trp:Tyr ratiomay have contributed to the improvement in perform-ance in the "responders" to Cr group.For the reason thatTable 2: Concentrations of total Trp, Tyr, LNAA and free-Trp before and after supplementation.

Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2008, 5:14 http://www.jissn.com/content/5/1/14 Page 10 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)plasma free-[Trp] was lower in both "responders" and "non-responders" but performance was improved only in the "responders" to Cr group (Table 2). Similarlyalthough, the plasma free-Trp:Tyr ratio was lower in the"responders" group this was evident only until the 40 mintime-point and not at exhaustion.It is possible thereforethat Cr is effective in reducing effort perception, through to a lower plasma free-[Trp], during exercise in the heat in both "responders" and "non-responders" to Cr loading;however, for eliciting an endurance performanceimprovement different but still unknown mechanism(s)may play a role.In the current investigation and in mostof the related literature involving humans, only indirect markers of brain 5-HT and DA function are assessed.
Nev- ertheless, several pharmacological studies, suggested thatoral Cr supplementation increased brain DA synthesis inthe substantia nigra of mice by protecting against striataldopamine depletion [22] and/or by enhancing tyrosinehydroxylase activation (the rate-limiting enzyme of brainDA biosynthesis) [23,24]. In addition, an improvement in mental function and diminished central fatigue was observed during performing a mathematical calculationfollowing oral Cr supplementation [16].Consequently,more controlled studies are warranted to examine thepotential effect of Cr on central fatigue during exercise inthe heat.Plasma [Prl] was found to be similar in all trials; however, since no differences observed in plasma [LNAA] and inthe ratio of free and total Trp:LNAA the similar plasma[Prl] results and the lack of significant correlation betweenplasma [Prl] and T rec were not entirely unexpected.
According to Wurtman [40] for example in order to elicit a reduction in brain Trp uptake and, therefore, attenua-tion in brain 5-HT turnover, a 5- to 6-fold elevation inplasma [LNAA] is required. In addition, Leathwood andFernstrom [41] suggested that a 13- to 26- fold elevationin total Trp:LNAA ratio is required to induce a change in the brain stem [5-HT] in monkeys.The association how- ever, between peripheral modulators of brain 5-HT func-tion and circulating [Prl] during exercise has not beenfully explained.Fischer et al.[42] for example, observedan increase in [Prl] during exercise in proportion to therise in plasma free-[Trp].Some investigators found a pos-itive correlation between serum [Prl] and T rec [43,44] dur- ing exercise in the heat and this relationship has been used to justify brain monoamine system involvement inregulating T rec and Prl secretion [11].Brisson et al.
[43,44] demonstrated that a body-temperature threshold valuehad to be reached for heat stress to induce a significantblood Prl response during active or passive heat exposure. These authors estimated this mean T rec threshold to be approximately 1.3°C – 1.7°C above normal body temper-ature values.In the present experiment, the rise in T rec induced by exercise in the heat far exceeded this thresholdin both pre- and post-supplementation trials, thus result- ing in a similar elevation in plasma [Prl] in both Plc and Cr groups (Table 4).However, Trec was lower in the post- Cr supplementation trial and Trec and plasma [Prl] were not correlated.These results are in agreement with anumber of previous studies [e.g., [45]] that showed thatPrl secretion is not always related to plasma free-[Trp] and this may be more evident during exercise in the heat.Con- sequently, although Cr was effective in reducing thermalstress, this reduction was insufficient to significantly alterplasma [Prl].
However, this finding does not necessarilypreclude a difference in hypothalamic Prl secretionbetween Plc and Cr trials. A number of previous classic studies have reported a sig- nificant correlation between plasma [FFA] and plasmafree-[Trp] primarily due to FFA displacing Trp from itsbinding to albumin [e.g., [46,47]].In the present experi-ment, the rise in plasma [FFA] was modest and not differ-ent between trials but plasma free-[Trp] was lower during exercise and at exhaustion on the post-Cr supplementa- tion trial.This somewhat surprising result, in conjunctionwith the lack of a significant correlation between plasma[FFA] and plasma free-[Trp] would suggest a more com-plex control of plasma free-[Trp] during exercise in theheat than previously described.
Since differences in plasma volume, which could partially explain the reduc- tion in plasma free-[Trp] and free-Trp:Tyr ratio were notobserved in the present experiment, the exact mecha-nism(s) responsible for the observed reduction in plasmafree-[Trp] and free-Trp:Tyr ratio after Cr loading (despiteno difference in plasma [FFA]) and the significance of these observations remain to be determined. The major limitations of the experiment were the indirect method used for classifying the participants into"responders" and "non-responders" to Cr.However, bynot pre-distinguishing the potential "responders" and "non-responders" to each particular ergogenic aid supple- ment, such as Cr treatment, the type II statistical errormight has been elevated.Syrotuik and Bell [48] for exam-ple, examined the physiological profile of "responders"and "non-responders" to 5-days Cr loading sub-dividedbased on their mean changes in resting muscle Cr + PCrlevels.
They found that there were three subdivisions of Cr supplementation: the "responders", the "quasi-respond- ers" and the "non-responders" to Cr, subdivided based ontheir intramuscular Cr uptake [with mean changes in rest-ing Cr + PCr of 29.5 mmol.kg -1 dw (n = 3), 14.9 mmol.kg- 1 dw (n = 5), and 5.1 mmol.kg-1 dw (n = 3), respectively]. They also observed that the "responders" had a higher per- centage of type II muscle fibres and the greatest pre-load muscle fibres cross-sectional area and fat free mass.Thesame group showed an improvement in 1RM leg pressscore following the Cr loading period.Whereas, the "non- Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2008, 5:14 http://www.jissn.com/content/5/1/14 Page 11 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)responders" group had exactly the opposite results than the responders group following the 5-days Cr loading period.
It is plausible therefore that the lack of differencesin exercise performance observed in the present experi-ment between the whole Cr and the Plc groups may bedue to a person-by-treatment different physiologicalresponse to Cr supplementation. Furthermore, this may be applied in several other studies which examined cen- tral fatigue during prolonged exercise either in the heat orin thermoneutral environment where pharmacologicaltreatment such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRI) and/or other precursors and inhibitors of brain ser-otonergic and dopaminergic systems were used as inter- ventions.In a psychophysiological study for example, where the differences between the "responders" and"non-responders" to drug (brofaromine and fluvoxam-ine) therapy were examined, it was suggested that heartrate and blood pressure responsiveness to the drugs bothwere different between the two groups, higher in the"non-responders" than the "responders" to the drug [49].
Similarly, Kampf-Sherf et al. [50] examined the physiolog- ical responses to SSRI treatment to depressed patients andthey suggested that only two third of patients with majordepression has shown a physiological responses to antide-pressants such as SSRI.Consequently, the present resultsmay help partially explain the equivocal performance and other physiological responses results reported in the liter- ature following ergogenic aid supplements and/or druginterventions of brain 5-HT and DA systems manipula-tion.Conclusion In conclusion, the effectiveness of Cr to reduce thermalstress per se and/or alter key modulators of brain 5-HT and DA function may have contributed to the reduced effortperception during exercise in the heat but not to thatextent in eliciting an enhancement of endurance perform-ance in the whole Cr group.
Consequently, the results pre- sented here are consistent with a centrally-mediated process of fatigue during strenuous exercise in the heateither with or without using Cr supplementation. It is pos-sible however, that Cr may improve performance only inthe "responders" to Cr; however, more studies are war-ranted to justify this concept.The present results may alsosuggest the demanding of the pre-experimental physio- logical identification of the "responders" and "non- responders" to Cr treatment.Otherwise, the possibility ofthe type II statistical error may be augmented.Future stud-ies need to investigate the direct effects of Cr supplemen-tation on brain 5-HT and DA systems and theirassociation with central fatigue development during exer- cise in the heat.
