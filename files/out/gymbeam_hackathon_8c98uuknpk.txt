gilardii CR3 ( 1). The JZ4 strain was also related to other Cupriavidus spp.such as C.metallidurans CH34 ( 2), which is found exclu- sively in heavy metal-contaminated environments ( 3–5).The JZ4 strain is also closely related to plant-associated species such as thenitrogen-ﬁxing symbiont of legumes C.taiwanensis strain LMG19424 ( 6) and C.plantarum isolated from the rhizosphere of sorghum ( 7).The genomic DNA was isolated using the Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit following the instructions from the manufac-turer.For genome sequencing, we used the Illumina TrueSeq sam-ple preparation kit and, following the manufacturer’s protocol,generated a paired-end library that had a calculated average insertsize of 500 bp.The Illumina MiSeq platform was used to generateDNA sequence reads of 300 bp and with a theoretical coverage of100-fold.Adapter sequences were removed with Illumina’s built-in read trimming tool and through the Spades assembler version3.6 ( 8).
MegaBLAST searches of strain JZ4 concatenated genomes against the NCBI reference genomic sequence database revealedthat the closest relative genome was C. gilardii CR3 ( 1).Functional annotation of the JZ4 strain was performed using the INDIGO pipeline ( 9) with the exception of the prediction of open reading frames (ORFs) by FragGeneScan ( 10).The genome sequence has 3,940 ORFs, 7 rRNAs, 53 tRNAs, and 92 ncRNAs.The annotation revealed both isochorismate lyase (EC 4.2.99.21)and isochorismatase (EC 3.3.2.1), two enzymes that are involvedin salicylic acid production ( 11).Moreover, the genome contains genes encoding cholesterol oxidase (EC 1.1.3.6), which have beendeveloped as a biotechnological tool to infer insect resistance inplants ( 12), and chitinase enzyme (EC 3.2.1.14), which has beenreported to be involved in fending off plant pathogenic fungi ( 13).
Further analysis of the genome sequence of the JZ4 strain will helpto elucidate the metabolic pathways involved in plant growth pro-motion and provide further insights into the molecular strategiesto control soilborne plant diseases.
