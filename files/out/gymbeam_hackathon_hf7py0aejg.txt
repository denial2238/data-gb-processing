Keywords: iron deﬁciency, iron deﬁciency anemia, preterm in fants, iron supplementation, correlative factors, growth INTRODUCTION Iron is an essential micronutrient for myriad of biochemica l and developmental processes including those involving neurodevelopment.Iron deﬁcienc y (ID) is the most prevalent single nutrient deﬁciency, which can be easily diagnosed and treat ed.In spite of this, about 800 million women and children worldwide had anemia, nearly half o f whom were caused by ID ( 1).
Numerous studies demonstrated that ID not only causes anemi a, but more importantly, adversely aﬀects neurodevelopment in rats, primates and humans due to its essential role in myelination, dendritic growth, synaptogenesis, neurotransmission and m onoamine metabolism ( 2–4). These pathophysiological changes will ultimately result in short an d long term multiple domains of Li et al.Iron Supplementation in Preterm Infants neurologizing abnormalities, including poorer motor, cogn itive and learning abilities, as well as social emotional functio ning (5–7).Thus, ID is considered to be an important public health probleminbothdevelopedanddevelopingcountries.The prevalence of ID peaks in infancy.Infants, especially preterm infants, are at an elevated risk of ID/IDA for their lo w endowment of iron stores at birth, early onset of erythropoie sis, rapid catch-up growth, iatrogenic blood loss and limited die tary sources of iron ( 8).
There is an evidence that preterm infants with a birth weight (BW) <1,830 g/L and a serum ferritin (SF) <155 ug/L in the 1st week of life had a 26.4 times higher risk of developing ID ( 9). Due to the critical role of iron in growth and central nervous system development, and the increased ri sk ofID/IDAinpreterminfants,speciﬁcironsupplementationisof greatimportanceforthisextremelyvulnerablepopulation.As we know, human brain develops rapidly in the last trimester, during which time the amount of iron absorbed in t he central nerves system also reaches its peak.When the body is i n a state of negative iron balance, iron reserves in the brain w ill be reduced and preferentially supplied for erythropoiesis.Altho ugh the subsequent iron supplementation in infancy can improve infant’s iron status ( 10–12), the beneﬁt on brain was limited (2,13,14).
Therefore, it makes more sense for premature infants to maintain iron balance in early postnatal life, which equiv alent tothepeakperiodofiron-dependentbraindevelopment,thanin laterinfancy( 15). However, in considerate of the poorly development antioxidant capacity in preterm infants and the potential risk of peroxidation damage caused by iron overload ( 16,17), iron supplementation should be cautious in this population.To date,thereisstillalackofglobalconsensusrecommendati onson iron supplement for premature infants.Indications, doses, ti me of initiation and duration of iron supplement are heterogenei ty in clinical practice in diﬀerent countries ( 16,18).In China, routine iron supplementation is recommended for preterm infants from the ﬁrst 2 ∼4 weeks after birth to the 12th month of corrected age, with a dosage of 2 mg/(kg ·d) (19).But data relating to the outcomes of this preventive approach is very limited.
More evidence-based medicine support is needed to further verify whether the current universal iron supplementation is appropriate for all preterm infants with diﬀerent iron status during early postnatal life. In order to ﬁ ll in the gaps, we conducted the present study to gain insight into th e eﬃciency of this general supplementation on iron homeostasis in preterm infants with and without neonatal anemia, and to investigate the eﬀects of iron supplementation on their growth in the ﬁrst half year of life.We predicted that elementary iro n supplementation of 2 mg/(kg ·d) beginning in early postnatal life and continuing in infancy would improve the infantile ir on statusofpreterminfants.MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design This was a follow-up study of general iron supplementation given from 40 weeks’ gestational age (GA) to 6 months of age to preterm infants with or without neonatal anemia.
Theintervention plan was based on the Chinese expert consensus (19)whichhasbeencommonlyusedinourclinicalpracticesince 2018. The study was conducted at Children’s Hospital Zhejian g UniversitySchoolofMedicinefromMay2018toOct2019.Data were obtained in a course of a study in the same area of the developmental eﬀects of fetal-neonatal ID in premature infant s.Outcomeswereassessedat3and6months.Participants A total of 266 preterm infants attending at the Follow-up Clini c for High-risk Infant were enrolled.The subjects had a GA of 27–36 weeks.Based on the lowest hemoglobin(Hb) recorded in themedicalrecordsduringtheirneonatalhospitalization, infants were divided into two groups: those with hemoglobin(Hb) <145 g/L within 28 days after birth were classiﬁed as neonatal anemic group (NA), and the others were classiﬁed as non-neonatal anemic (NNA) group.
Exclusion criteria were hemoglobinopathies,historyofreceivederythropoietin,cy anotic heart disease, congenital intrauterine infection, congen ital malformations,andhemolyticormetabolicdiseases. All the enrolled infants were required to have a monthly follow-up since 40 weeks’ GA, and provided with iron supplements (2 mg/kg per day iron as oral iron proteinsuccynilate [Lee’s Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited, Hong Kong]) from then on.Preterm infants in this study cohort were not introduced to have complementary food, so the total daily iron intake was calculated as the sum of iron supplements and the iron from formula and/or breast milk fortiﬁer.During the follow-up visits, parents’ compliance wit h iron supplementation was monitored by a designated nurse using a questionnaire.Poor compliance with the interventio n wasdeﬁnedas <70%ofdoses.
Data Collection During the ﬁrst interview, parents were required to complete a questionnairecoveringtheinformationregardingdemogra phics, maternal complications during pregnancy (gestational diabet es, pregnancy induced hypertension, anemia), family history of genetic and chronic diseases, parental education, occupatio n and household income. Meanwhile, perinatal data, including BW, Apgar scores, GA, neonatal complications (intracranial hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, alimentary tract hemorrhage and enteritis anaphylactica et al.), as well as information about hemoglobin (Hb, including values tested at birth and the day before discharge, and the lowest value duri ng neonatal period), history of iron supplementation and/or bloo d transfusionwereallcollectedfromneonatalmedicalrecor ds.
At each visit, information regarding the type of feeding (breast feeding with or without fortiﬁer, regular or preterm formula feeding and mixed feeding), amount of milk intake an d anthropometric data were collected. Anthropometric data wer e evaluated according to corrected age by using WHO references (20).Growth velocity was indicated by weight gain per day, calculated as (weight at assessment- birth weight)/chrono logical age.During the interview, parents were also asked to ﬁll a checklist including the following events that occurred sinc e the last follow-up: watery diarrhea ( >5 episodes of watery stools per Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 687119 Li et al.Iron Supplementation in Preterm Infants day), loose stools, hard stools, vomiting ( >5 episodes per day), crying, rash and fatigue.Data of 3 and 6 months were used foranalysis.Blood Collection and Measurement Venous blood samples were collected at 3 and 6 months.
Serum ferritin (SF), serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC ), Hb, mean cell volume (MCV), Red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Approximately 3ml of venous blood was collected in plain and EDTA containers.EDTA-treated blood was used for Hb and MCV analysis.Blood collected in plain tubes was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5min to separate serum.Separated serum was transferred to a fresh vial and was used for the estimation of SFlevels.Hb,MCV,andRDWwereanalyzedbyauto-analyzer(Sysmex SE-9000 Auto Hematology Analyzer, Kobe, Japan).Serum iron and TIBC were measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay (Beckman Coulter Chemistry Analyzer AU5800, Japan).SF level was determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay(Cobas 6000-601, roche, Switzerland) and CRP was measured by rate nephelometry using a QuikRead 101 instrument (Orion Diagnostics).Transferrin saturation (TS) was calculated from ironandtransferrinlevels.
ID is diagnosed if two or more of the following outliers are met: MCV <74 ﬂ, RDW >14%, ferritin <12µg/L, serum iron<10.74 umol/L, TS <12% and TIBC >62.65 umol/L.

To identify the diﬀerences in anthropometric measures betweenNAandNNAgroups,analysisofcovariance(ANCOVA) was conducted, controlling for GA and BW.Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze correlative factor s for ID/IDA.Statisticalsigniﬁcancewasdeﬁnedasa p<0.05.RESULTS Sample Characteristics In this study, a total of 266 preterm infants were enrolled, including 162 cases of NA and 104 cases of NNA.
Among them, 15 dropped out of the study at 3 months for the reasons that: parents’ refusal to have their children blood-drawn ( n=7), incompletebloodsamplesorsamplehemolysisthatcouldnotbe processed ( n=4), elevated CRP ( n=1), poor compliance ( n= 3).At6months,another10infantsdroppedoutdueto:refusalo f blood drawing ( n=1), incomplete blood samples ( n=3), poor compliance ( n=1), family lost contact ( n=5). The baseline characteristics of excluded infants were similar with thos e who completedthewholefollow-upperiod(datanotshown).Finall y, a total of 250 3-month-old (154 in the NA group vs.96 in the NNA group) and 240 6-month-old infants (150 in the NA group vs.90 in the NNA group) were enrolled for data analysis (Figure1).The background characteristics were compared between the two groups ( Table1).The groups diﬀering in GA, BW, and Hb values (including the lowest value obtained during neona tal period, the values tested at birth and the day before discharg e).
The mean values of the above parameters in the NA group were allsigniﬁcantlylowerthanthoseinNNAgroup(all p<0.001). In addition, due to the small number of cases, we combined infants with maternal gestational diabetes, anemia and/or hypertension into a category of infants with maternal complication; those with necrotizing enterocoliti s, gastrointestinal bleeding and/or enteritis anaphylactica into a category of infants with digestive system diseases.By data analysis, we found that infants in the NA group had a higher incidence of digestive diseases ( p=0.001) and intracranial hemorrhage ( p=0.029), and also had a higher proportion receiving blood transfusion and/or oral iron supplementation during neonatal hospitalization (all p<0.001).A total of 10 preterm infants (4%) had a history of multiple blood transfusions ( ≥2).There were no diﬀerences in other backgroundcharacteristicsbetweenthetwogroups.

The prevalence of anemia at 6 months in both groups was much lower than that ofthegeneralpopulationinthesamearea(20.8%)( 23). In order to understand the eﬀects of iron supplementation and/or blood transfusion during neonatal hospitalization o n the eﬀectiveness of infantile general iron supplementation in premature infants, we divided the NA group into two subgroups:infantswithahistoryofironsupplementationand/o r blood transfusion during neonatal hospitalization (NAT) an d infants without a history of iron supplementation and/or bloo d transfusion (NAU).As shown in Table3, the lowest value of Hb testedduringneonatalperiodoftheNATgroupwassigniﬁcant ly lower than that of the NAU ( p<0.001).With daily iron supplementation,theHblevelandtheprevalenceofIDandIDA were similar between the two subgroups at the 3- and 6-month testing (all p>0.05).Other parameters, including MCV, RDW,serum iron, TS and TIBC were all within the normal range in twogroups.
Factors Associated With ID To identify factors associated with ID/IDA in the case of dai ly iron supplementation among premature infants, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, with GA, BW, Hb (lowest value during neonatal period, and the values tested at birth, before discharge and at 3 months), sex, maternal complications, neonatal digestive system diseases, intracra nial hemorrhage, neonatal history of external iron sources and b lood transfusion,growthvelocityandfeedingpatternsascovari ates. Through analysis, we found that Hb at birth and history of blood transfusion during neonatal hospitalization were important factors inﬂuencing the prevalence of ID/IDA at 3 months (Table4).Preterm infants with higher Hb level at birth werelesslikelytodevelopID/IDAthanthosewithlowerHble vel (OR=0.98, 95% CI 0.96–1.00, p=0.012); and those with a history of blood transfusion were less likely to have ID/IDA i n earlyinfancy(OR =0.03,95%CI0.00–0.45, p=0.011).
At 6 months, the occurrence of ID/IDA was closely related to sex,3-month’sHbandfeedingpatterns( Table5).Boyshada3.35 times higher risk to develop ID/IDA compared with girls (OR =3.35, 95% CI 1.20–9.36, p=0.021).

Supplement Tolerance and Adverse Events In our study, blood tests at 3 and 6 months showed no iron overload in either groups.There were also no diﬀerences in the parental report of vomiting (2 vs.1), diarrhea (0 vs.0) or respiratory illness (6 vs.3) between the NA and NNA group (allp>0.05).DISCUSSION Thepresentstudyprovidesanimportantupdateontheevidence regarding the eﬀect of enteral iron supplementation on healthoutcomes in preterm infants with and without neonatal anemia .Wefoundthatdailyironsupplementationreducedprevalenceof ID/IDA during the ﬁrst 6 months of life, with no iron overload and adverse eﬀects on growth.Hb at birth and the history of blood transfusion were important factors associated with th e prevalence of ID/IDA at 3 months.Sex, 3-month’s Hb value and feeding patterns were important factors aﬀecting ID/IDA at 6months.
Withoutironsupplementation,preterminfantsgenerallyhave an increased risk of developing ID/IDA. A Chinese and a Swedish cohort reported that the prevalence of anemia among preterm infants without iron supplementation was as high as 38.5 and 40.9%, respectively ( 10,24).Consequently, speciﬁc iron supplementation is recommended in many studies.Some researchers recommend 2 mg/kg iron supplementation for preterm infants from 6 weeks to 6 months of age ( 10,11), while others suggest that iron supplementation for the target population should be individualized ( 25).According to the consensus of experts in China, this study used a daily dose of 2 mg/kg of iron within 6 months.Through the follow-up, it was found that after 6 months’ iron supplementation, the incidenc e of ID/IDA in NA and NNA group was quite similar.

To further determine whether a history of neonatal iron supplementation and/or blood transfusion would inﬂuence the eﬀectiveness of routine iron supplementation, we compared the iron status parameters in NAT and NAU group during neonatal hospitalization. Through analysis, we found that after dail y iron supplementation, the incidence of ID/IDA in both groups was similarandnoiron-overloadwasfound.Theresultsreveale dthat thedailydosageof2mg/kgexternalironduringearlyinfancy was reasonableregardlessoftheirneonataltreatment.In our cohort, most of the preterm infants were maintained at an optimal iron status through iron supplementation during follow-up.However, ∼15% of them still suﬀered from ID/IDA.
As ID/IDA can have many adverse consequences, especially for the long-term detrimental eﬀects on neurodevelopment, prevention, early detection and treatment are vitally import ant forthevulnerablepopulation( 27,28).Therefore,weinvestigated factors aﬀecting the occurrence of ID/IDA in the enrolled subjectsatpostnatalageof3and6months.WefoundthatHbat birth and the history of blood transfusion are two critical f actors aﬀectingtheprevalenceofID/IDAduringearlypostnatallife. Infants with higher Hb level at birth had a decreased prevalence of ID/IDA, which indicated that iron status at 3 months of age depends largely on the iron storage at birth.It was consistent with the results from previous studies that ir on endowment at birth were adequate to meet the requirements of premature infants for at least 2–3 months of life ( 29,30).The larger the iron stores at birth, the greater the protectio nfrom the iron burden in early infancy ( 9,31).
Besides, we foundthatbloodtransfusionduringneonatalhospitalizati onwas another factor that reduced the risk of ID/IDA at 3 months. Red blood cell transfusion can increase hemoglobin serum lev els and ferritin levels in preterm infants ( 32).Some researchers claimed that multiple RBC transfusions might tip the balance of iron homeostasis in premature infants and then lead to a higherriskofironoverload,andrecommendedcautioningivi ng iron supplements in this patient population ( 33,34).In our study, 4% infant had a history of multiple blood transfusions.After receiving daily iron supplementation during follow up, none of them developed iron overload.Due to the diﬀerences in age of blood testing and the sample size, we have not directl y compare our current results with previous studies yet.
But we speculated that human body has the ability to maintain iron homeostasis for a period of time after blood transfusion, for hepcidin may be an important factor involved in this process, acting as a negative feedback regulator for iron hemostasis a fter bloodtransfusion( 32). With age increasing, we found the above two factors were no longer major factors on the iron status.Instead, sex, Hb at 3 months and feeding patterns became the main factors at 6 months.In the present study, we found that male preterm infants had a 3.35-folder increased risk for developing ID/I DA compared to females.Similar ﬁndings were also reported in full-term infants, boys demonstrated lower Hb, MCV and ferritin, as well as higher ZPP and TfR than girls ( 35–37).Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 7 May 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 687119 Li et al.Iron Supplementation in Preterm Infants TABLE 5 | Factors associate with ID/IDA at 6 months.

However, in our sample, under daily iron supplementation, the growth velocity was not an important factor aﬀecting the iron status. Thus, the higher risk of ID/IDA cannot be simply attributed to growth-related factor, but is more likely to be related to ot her correlative factors.Domellöf et al.reported hormonal fact orswere responsible for the gender diﬀerences in iron metabolism (35).Nonetheless, our study has had no measures relevant to theseintriguingpossibilities.In addition to sex, we found that Hb levels at 3 months also aﬀectedtheprevalenceofID/IDAat6months.Aroundthistime, iron from maternal storage and iron intake from milk becomes insuﬃcient to meet the increasing needs for rapid catch-up growth and blood volume expansion, which leaves the preterm infants vulnerable to ID/IDA ( 34).Therefore, iron homeostasis Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 8 May 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 687119 Li et al.
Iron Supplementation in Preterm Infants at 6 months is more associated with the Hb levels at 3 months of agethanHbtestedatbirthandbeforedischarge. Similar to the prior studies in full-term infants ( 25,37), we also found that preterm infants who were fortiﬁed fed, conventional formula-fed and mixed-fed had a lower risk of developing ID/IDA compared with infants who were exclusively breastfeeding, even in the case of daily iron supplementation.In the present study, none of the enrolled subjects had added complementary foods, so the total daily iron intake was calculated as the sum of iron supplements and iron intake from milk.Theoretically,thesumofallironintakeshouldbethe same for preterm infants in diﬀerent feeding patterns, with the dosa ge of 2 mg/kg per day.However, why is the feeding pattern still closely related to the iron status of preterm infants at the ag e of 6 months in our sample?
We speculated that this may be attribute to better compliance with dairy milk intake than or al iron supplements. Further well-designed studies are needed t o answerthisquestion.Some researchers have concerns about potential adverse eﬀects of routine iron supplementation relate to iron overload andgrowth,especiallyiniron-suﬃcientinfants( 39).Inourstudy, all the enrolled preterm infants, with or without a history of neonatal anemia, received daily iron supplementation starti ng at 40 weeks GA.We did ﬁnd that routine iron supplementation was beneﬁcial to maintain preterm infants’ iron homeostasis , including those who were well-nourished or had a history of blood transfusion, with no iron overload observed.In addit ion, we also found that growth levels of infants in the NA group caught up with those in the NNA group at 3 and 6 months corrected age by controlling for BW, with rare side eﬀects.
Th e results above indicated that moderate iron supplementation wa s safeanddidnothaveobviousadverseeﬀectsforpreterminfant s. Taken together, these ﬁndings support our hypothesis that early iron supplementation is a critical strategy to prevent ID/IDA in preterm infants.A relative low iron intake at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day is appropriate for most premature infants in ourfollow-upcohortwithandwithoutneonatalanemia.Over all, fewenrolledsubjectshadID/IDAat3and6months,respective ly.Preterm infants with higher level of Hb at birth and having a history of early treatment of blood transfusion may reduce t he risk of developing of ID/IDA at 3 months; female infants, and thosewhohadhigherlevelHbat3monthsorwhowerefedwith formulaorfortiﬁerhadalowerriskofID/IDAat6monthsinth e presenceofdailyironsupplementation.Nevertheless, our study had several limitations.First, ou r study was limited by a relatively small sample size and short follow-up period, although comparable to some other studies.
Second, the enrolled subjects were grouped based on the resul ts of hemoglobin in their medical records, lacking iron status measures during neonatal period. Third, in the consideratio n of ethical issues, we did not set up a sub-group with normal iron status who were not provided with oral iron.Therefore, further well-designed longitudinal multicenter follow-up studies will be needed to expand the sample size of preterm infants with diﬀerent iron status, to better monitor the long-term eﬀect of routine iron supplementation among the target population and ultimatelytodetermineifourresultscanbegeneralized.CONCLUSION In summary, our study indicated that ID/IDA can be prevented eﬀectively and safely with general iron supplementation at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day in preterm infants during the ﬁrst 6 months of life.
In the context of routine iron supplementation , Hb level at birth and early treatment of blood transfusion were two main factors aﬀecting the iron status in early infancy; while Hb values at 3 months, sex and feeding patterns contribute to the iron status in the later stage among the pati ent population. Enteral iron supplementation in preterm infants should continue to be implemented, and iron status indicator s such as hemoglobin, ferritin and ZPP/H should be regularly monitoredduringinfancy.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be madeavailablebytheauthors,withoutunduereservation.ETHICS STATEMENT The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the Children’s Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Permit Number: 2019- IRB-027).Written informed consent to participate in this study wasprovidedbytheparticipants’legalguardian/nextofkin.
