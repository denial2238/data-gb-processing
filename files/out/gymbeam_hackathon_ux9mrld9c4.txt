Abstract: Tribulus terrestris L.
(TT) ingredients have anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant activities, but their effects on exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) in trained athletes are uncertain. The purpose of this single-blind placebo-controlled trial, in accordance with CONSORT guidelines, was to examine the effect of 6 weeks of TTsupplementation on muscle metabolism, inﬂammation biomarkers, and oxidant status.Thirty trained male CrossFit®athletes were randomly assigned to be supplemented with 770 mg/day of TT(intervention group (IG)) or receive a placebo daily (control group (CG)) for 6 weeks.Muscle damage enzymes, inﬂammation biomarkers, and Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) were assessed at baseline (T1), 21 days after baseline (T2), and after 42 days (T3).Grace, a Workout of the Day, was measured in T1 and T3.Statistical signiﬁcance ( p< 0.05) was found between IG and CG in Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and TAS levels at the end of the follow-up.
Furthermore, TAS levels were signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) lower at T2 and T3 relative to baseline in the IG, also LDH and CRP increased signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) at T2 and T3 relative to baseline in the CG. No signiﬁcant ( p> 0.05) decreases in muscle damage or inﬂammation biomarkers were observed, although a slight downward trend was observed after 6 weeks for supplemented athletes.TTsupplementation could attenuate the CrossFit®training program-induced oxidative stress, muscle damage, and inﬂammation which could be due to the natural antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory properties of TT.Keywords: Tribulus terrestris L.; herbal supplementation; CrossFit®; muscle damage; inﬂammation response; exercise-induced oxidative stress 1.Introduction CrossFit®is a ﬁtness methodology based on standardized and varied functional movements performed at high intensity called “Workouts of the Day” (WODs) [ 1].
It is designed to improve general ﬁtness parameters (cardiovascular endurance, skeletal muscle strength, body composition, ﬂexibility) and sports performance (agility, speed, power, strength, accuracy) [ 2]. In CrossFit®training time, all WODs are completed at maximum intensity, in a repetitive way without recovery time in between [ 3].In particular, the focus Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2022 ,19, 16158.https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192316158 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2022 ,19, 16158 2 of 13 on constant variation of functional movements in CrossFit®training allows for the use of core elements of gymnastics, weightlifting exercises, and cardiovascular activities as exercise tasks.Thus, CrossFit®is also considered an option for high-intensity interval training (HIIT) [ 2].Extenuating physical activity leads to tissue damage resulting from an excessive inﬂammatory reaction that can impair muscle performance [ 4].
Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) triggers an inﬂammatory response with a decrease in muscle strength, localized swelling, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and an increase in muscle proteins in the blood such as creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and myoglobin (Mb) [ 5,6]. Additionally, EIMD triggers inﬂammatory responses that result in elevations of inﬂammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) interleukins (IL) IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF- α) [5,7].Consequently, EIMD, can negatively affect an individual’s athletic performance and training quality, especially training with short recovery periods.The high physical demands of CrossFit®means that the usual nutritional recommen- dations needed to improve athletes’ performance are insufﬁcient [ 8,9].Nutrition is the foundation of ﬁtness and health for CrossFit, and it is considered the basis for WODs.
Since CrossFit®is a sport with one of the most demanding physical components on the planet (it employs a combination of many training disciplines), it utilizes all energy systems in strenuous WODs. Therefore, it seems reasonable to implement nutritional aids that allow the nutritional requirements of athletes to be met, optimizing their health and athletic performance, which are also consistent with the principles of rational nutrition.[ 8].In this regard, the use of herbal supplements has increased in recent years due to their potential effects on health and physical performance, attributed to their bioactive components [ 10].Tribulus terrestris L.(TT) is one of the most widely marketed herbal supplements among the Western population and is commonly used as a medicinal herb in Ayurvedic medicine [ 11].TTis an exotic plant from the Zygophyllaceae family , genus T ribulus , which includes 20 different plants species.
The most widely known bioactive components of TTare saponins, flavonoids, glycosides, alkaloids, and tannins, among others. [ 12].TTsaponins possess mod- erate dose-dependent anti-inflammatory properties and TTpolyphenols, flavonoids, and act as antioxidants and effectively scavenge the free radicals in a concentration-dependent man- ner [ 12,13].Therefore, TTwould reduce inflammation [ 14] by attenuating muscle damage [ 15] modulating and oxidative damage [16].Considering that athletes need to mitigate EIMD, for quick recovery between workouts or competitions, the use of well-supported nutritional and supplementation strategies can be important allies of CrossFit®.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of 6 weeks of TTintake on the enzymes and proteins indicative of muscle metabolism as serum Mb, CK, LDH, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), and Aldolase; inﬂammatory biomarkers as IL-6 and CRP levels; and oxidant status as Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) levels, in trained CrossFit®athletes. Additionally, we have controlled the fatigue level by “Grace” (WODs) during a high-intensity CrossFit® training program.We hypothesize that TTwould substantially modulate muscle damage, inﬂammation, and oxidative status induced by the CrossFit®training program, without toxicity in athletes.We have previously conducted a randomized, single-blind, placebo- controlled study on CrossFit®athletes, evaluating hormonal behavior, body composition, and perceived exertion [ 17].Thus, with the methodological structure of our previous study [17], we have conducted a placebo-controlled trial on CrossFit®athletes.2.
Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants Participants’ characteristics are shown in Table 1.Thirty adult men, healthy and non- smokers, volunteered to participate in this study.Volunteers were trained and participated in regular exercise on average ≥3 times per week for the previous 12 months.In this study, the following inclusion criteria were established: (i) ≥20 months of previous CrossFit® training; (ii) perform “Fran” (WODs) ≤250 s; (iii) men; (iv) age range between 18 and Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2022 ,19, 16158 3 of 13 50 years (both inclusive).Exclusion criteria included any kidney misfunction, a known intolerance or allergy to herbal supplements, a recent febrile illness, lower limb trauma, or any history of muscle injury.Table 1.Participant’s Anthropometric and Exercise Performance Proﬁle.

Before the study, all participants were informed about all possible risks or discomforts and beneﬁts associated with the study and signed the consent form. The experiment procedures were approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREC) of Valladolid Clinical Hospital (PI-19-1350).2.2.Research Design A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to study whether supplementation with TTover 6 weeks can improve or reduce muscle damage and inﬂam- mation biomarkers, following a structured CrossFit®workout.All participants maintained an identical diet throughout the 6 weeks, inspected by a nutritionist on the research staff of this study.We have applied the guidelines of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) (Table S1) [18].
The sample size estimation was performed using the G* Power 3.1.97 statistical power analysis program (University of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany; accessed on https: //es.freedownloadmanager.org/Windows-PC/Gpower-GRATIS.html) (accessed on 10 July 2021) [ 19]. The number of mandatory participants was calculated to measure differences between independent groups, following the methodology of our recent study [ 20] for trials with small sample sizes.A sample of n= 15 participants per study group for a total of n= 30 volunteers was needed, considering a dropout rate ≤20%.At the beginning of the 6-week intervention period, individuals randomly received pre-packed capsules which included either a placebo (PL) or the TTsupplement and labeled with the day of consumption.The randomization sequence was statistically designed to assign the participants to the two study groups (control group (CG) and intervention group (IG)) using a stratiﬁed block design.
The IG received 2 TTcapsules from Quamtrax®Pharmaceuticals (Quamtrax® Nutrition Europe S.L. Fuenlabrada, Madrid, Spain) with 770 mg daily; TTextract 72.64% (385 mg/cap) at 40% of saponins.The CG received 2 placebo capsules of 100 mg, formulated using maltodextrin capsules to simulate the color and texture of the TTcapsules, to generate a highly reliable blinding.The placebo was manufactured at the Magistral Formulation Laboratory of a Pharmacy (Soria, Spain).Participants were instructed to ingest the capsules orally with 200 mL of water, in 1 daily dosage, taken 30 min after CrossFit®workout.Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2022 ,19, 16158 4 of 13 2.3.Dietary Assessment To standardize diet and antioxidant status, participants were advised to have the same standard diet (50% carbs, 40% protein, and 10% fat) prescribed by a registered professional dietitian-nutritionist.
This dietitian-nutritionist carefully documented in detail the daily food and ﬂuid intake of the subjects throughout the trial to ensure that they had followed the diet they were given. Participants were instructed on how to complete the diet-recall questionnaires and determine food servings and sizes by a registered professional dietitian.The CrossFit®athletes were instructed using 2 diet tracking methods previously used in our studies [ 17,21]: (i) a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that included 139 different foods and beverages, sorted by food type and meal pattern, at T3 of the previous 6 weeks, and (ii) a 7-day dietary recall questionnaire of the 7 days prior to T3.The data obtained from each food were converted into micronutrients, macronutrients, and total energy intake, using the standardized Easy diet ©software.Additionally, we proceeded to measure the total energy intake * Kg−1for each CrossFit®athlete [22].2.4.
Anthropometric Measurements An internationally certiﬁed anthropometrist (ISAK level 3 with certiﬁcate number: #63673929292503670742) performed the anthropometric measurements of all CrossFit® athletes. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) (BC-730; Tanita, Japan) was employed to calculate body mass and fat mass; a stadiometer was used to measure height.2.5.Blood Collection and Biomarkers Analysis All participants attended the laboratory for blood collection at 3 specific times: at baseline (T1), 21 days after baseline (T2), and at the end of the study after 42 days (T3) (Figure 1).Blood samples (10 mL each) were collected from the antecubital vein of all athletes at each point (T1, T2, and T3), under baseline conditions, after an overnight fast, and 36 h without exercise.For blood collection, CrossFit®athletes arrived at the laboratory at 8:30 am and upon arrival sat comfortably for 30 min.
The collection and transport of blood samples was performed following the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) standards [ 23]. The preparation of the blood samples prior to the determination of the biomarkers was performed following our previously described methodology [ 17,21].Serum myoglobin (Mb) was determined by a chemiluminescent luminol reaction after adsorption to anti-myoglobin IgG onto a solid phase.%CK-MB fraction, calculated as (CK-MB/CK) * 100, LDH, aldolase, ALT /GPT, and GOT/AST were measured using classic enzymatic methods, in a Hitachi autoanalyzer (Hi- tachi 917, Japan).Urea was measured using a colorimetric enzymatic method and creatinine was measured using the Jaffe’s reaction adapted kinetic method.Human IL-6 ELISA ™kit (ab178013) (INVITROGEN; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) was used to measure the serum IL-6 level with a sensitivity of <2 pg/mL.
CRP was also measured with the ELISA method using a CRP Human ELISA ™kit (BMS288INST) (INVIT- ROGEN; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) with a sensitivity of <10 pg/mL. The white blood cells (WB), monocytes (MON), lymphocyte (LIM), red blood cells (RCB), hemoglobin (Hb), and hematocrit (Hct) were evaluated in a System Coulter Counter MAX-M model hematological counter.TAS was determined by an automated Rel Assay measurement method Total Antioxidant Status (E-BC-K801-M) (Elabscience Biotech- nology , USA).TAS is usually used to estimate the overall oxidation state of the body [ 24].All biomarker tests were performed in a public hospital of the Castile and Leon Health Network (SACyL), Santa Barbara Hospital of Soria (Spain), with the corresponding controls of the technique.Percent variation in plasma volume (% ∆PV) was estimated using Van Beaumont’s method.
Moreover, analytical marker values make an adjustment by: Corrected value = Uncorrected value * ((100 + % ∆PV)/100) [22].

Each 1.5 h CrossFit® training session consisted of 3 sections such as specific warm-up, WODs, and cool-down. Each workout was performed in the partic- ipants’ own gym, supervised by a certified CrossFit® Degree 1- or 2-certified instructor (each).All subjects completed the same physical activity routines to ensure that they per- formed the same prescribed workout duri ng the study.In addition, CrossFit® athletes were specifically asked not to perform CrossFit routines outside of the structured training program.2.7.“Workouts of the Day” (WODs) Fran’s inclusion WODs consisted of three rounds of thrusters and pull-ups for 21, 15, and 9 repetitions [1,2].Fran is one of the mo st famous types of training that all CrossFit ® athletes do to monitor their performance impr ovements.
Thanks to its great scalability, Fran has become famous as a key exercise to know the athlete’s progress and many Cross- Fit® athletes use it as a unique yardstick to measure their physical capacity and analyze physical progress [25]. Furthermore, Zeitz et al.[26] have reported that the 33% increase in performance variation in Fran can be expl ained by improvements in strength.Butcher et al.[27] verified that Fran was strongly correlated with strength data and oxygen con- sumption at the anaerobic threshold.The 250 s mark is the cut-off point for participation in local amateur CrossFit® competitions, and it is considered an advanced level of Cross- Fit® with times over 4 min [1,2].We have controlled the fatigue level using the Grace test (WODs) following the in- ternational CrossFit® protocols [1,2].For Grace, CrossFit® athletes performed 30 clean and jerk repetitions, and the time in seconds (s) to complete them was measured.
The male athletes were required to use weights of 61.4 kg [1,2]. The Grace test was assessed at base- line (T1), when TT supplementation had not yet begun, and at the final day of the study (T3) after 6 weeks.2.8.Blinding The participants ( n = 30) completed a form intended to assess the effectiveness of the single-blinding process in the study.The results of the questionnaire indicated that 90% (n = 27) of the CrossFit® athletes did not identify the group to which they were assigned.Only 1 participant stated and correctly knew which group in the study he belonged to.These results could indicate that the single blinding was fruitful.Figure 1.The implementation schedule for the 6 weeks of the study.2.6.CrossFit Training Participants trained in 3 sessions on alternate weekdays (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for a total of 4.5 h/week.The start of all CrossFit®training sessions was between 6:00 p.m.and 8:00 p.m.

The statistical analysis was carried out using STATA version 15.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA), SPSS software version 24.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Excel version 19). The results were contained as means and standard deviations.Statistical Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2022 ,19, 16158 6 of 13 signiﬁcance was established at a value of p< 0.05.The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to determine the normality of the variables.Parametric tests were used because the data followed a normal distribution.To determine the differences between the groups (IG and CG) at baseline and the end of the study, a t-test for independent variables was used for the sample characteristics, dietary assessments, and performance tests.In addition, a t-test for dependent variables was used to determine the existence of signiﬁcant differences between the performance tests at T1 and T3.
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was performed to examine the effects of the time ×TTsupplementation interaction on the different groups (IG and CG) and the muscle damage (AST, ALT, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and Mb), inﬂammation (IL-6 and CRP), and oxidant response (TAS) of the groups. The differences between the biomarkers at different times during the study were determined using the Scheff étest.The percent changes in the WODs test studied in the CG and IG between T1 and T3 were calculated through the following formula: ∆% = ((T3 −T1)/T1) ∗100; to determine whether the differences in these percentages between groups were signiﬁcant, the t-test for independent samples was used.3.Results 3.1.Recruitment and Randomization Forty-five CrossFit®athletes were enrolled; however, seven participants declined to take part in the study .
The remaining 38 CrossFit®athletes were tested with “Fran” (WODs), and 6 athletes were discarded for presenting results, time to complete the test > 250 s. In addition, two participants were rejected because they chronically consumed anti-inflammatory drugs that could alter the biomarkers of the study .Finally , 30 CrossFit®athletes were involved in the study .Thirty athletes were randomly assigned into two groups (control group (CG; n= 15) and intervention group (IG; n= 15)).None of the 30 participants dropped out of the study or interrupted the intervention, so all participants were tested at T1, T2, and T3 (Figure S1).No signiﬁcant differences ( p> 0.05) were obtained in the anthropometric and exercise performance proﬁle between CG and IG, as described in Table 1.3.2.Dietary Assessment During the study, there was no signiﬁcant difference between CG and IG ( p> 0.05) for the dietary components reported in Table S2.3.3.
Blood Collection and Biomarkers Analysis The % ∆VP of the CrossFit®athletes was reduced by 3.3 % between baseline and T2. In addition, % ∆VP also decreased by 3.7% between baseline and T3.Following these results, we proceeded to the adjustment of all biomarkers.3.4.Muscle Biomarkers No signiﬁcant differences ( p> 0.05) between the time points (T1, T2, and T3) nor between CG and IG were detected for ALT, AST, Mb, aldolase, CK, CK-MB.Signiﬁcant differences ( p< 0.05) were observed between the three study points in the CG for LDH.In addition, for LDH there were signiﬁcant differences ( p< 0.05) in Condition ×Time between both groups (CG and IG).For the CG, a signiﬁcant increase ( p< 0.05) in LDH was observed at T2 (353.11 ±9.12 UI/L) and T3 (366.50 ±10.71) compared to T1 (312.13 ±10.81 UI/L).However, LDH had a downward trend in the IG from baseline (328.59 ±5.49 UI/L) to T3 (314.14 ±4.70 UI/L) (Table 2).Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2022 ,19, 16158 7 of 13 Table 2.

For a better understanding, we have divided the discussion into several sections. 4.1.Inﬂammatory Biomarkers WODs are recognized as one of the modalities of very-high-intensity functional train- ing with minimal or no rest between bouts, making WODs a strenuous workout [ 3].In response to demanding physical exercise, proinﬂammatory mediators are released, such as IL-6, IL-1, IL-4, or TNF- αand acute phase proteins such as CRP , increasing their plasma levels [ 28].These mediators are biomarkers of the inﬂammatory response [ 29].In a previ- ous study [ 15],TT’s supplementation for 2 weeks with 500 mg/day had no effect on IL-6 or hs-CRP in healthy non-athletic men after resistance exercise.According to these ﬁnd- Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2022 ,19, 16158 9 of 13 ings, we did not observe any effect on IL-6.
However, we showed a signiﬁcant difference regarding between-group changes in CRP ( p< 0.05) and a signiﬁcant ( p< 0.05) increase in the CG, with a moderate downward trend in the IG. These differences could be due to the supplementation time, dose, or composition of TT/acute.ts1ssupplement.The potential anti-inﬂammatory effect of Tribulus may be due to the modulating ac- tion on inﬂammatory pathways of TTcomponents [ 30].The polyphenols could act by inhibiting NF-B κactivation, suppressing the activation and phosphorylation of JAK/STAT proteins [ 31,32], but the ﬂavonoids would also act by inhibiting COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by decreasing the expression of p-JNK [ 31].Based on the above mech- anisms [ 31,32], it can be hypothesized that the 6-week consumption of TT may be effective in controlling the overall inﬂammatory state by modulating CRP increases.
However, TT supplementation in physically active individuals would not modulate the exercise-induced IL-6 response. Perhaps TTlacks immunomodulatory properties, which regulate inﬂam- matory states for a longer duration.However, an in vitro study in RAW 264.7 cells [ 32] reported that Tribulusamide D (phenolic amides from the fruits of TT) treatment reduced the expression of inﬂammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10, and TNF- α[32].4.2.Antioxidant Biomarkers A recent study [ 33] showed a signiﬁcant ( p< 0.05) decrease in plasma total antioxidant capacity after vigorous WODs.A CrossFit®-based metabolic conditioning session increases oxidative stress in proportion to the intensity or fatigue induced by the duration of the training session [ 34].
The high metabolic and mechanical demands of CrossFit®would trigger different major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribution during and after WODs [ 33].TT/acute.ts1spolyphenols and ﬂavonoids act as antioxidants [ 12,35] which could modulate oxidative damage [ 16] by neutralizing the ROS, and potentially enhance post-WODs recovery [ 36]. Da silva et al.[ 37] reported the decrease of oxidative stress in endurance training athletes supplemented for 8 weeks with 500 mg/day of TT.In addition, in cadmium-intoxicated rats supplemented with TTextract (5 mg/kg) that reduced the elevation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) [ 37], thiobarbituric acid was formed as a by-product of lipid peroxidation.These results agree with those reported in our study, where IG signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) increased TAS.TAS evaluates the dynamic balance between the antioxidant system and prooxidants [ 6].
Regarding the antioxidant activity of TT, we could hypothesize that long-term supplementation of TT(6 weeks, 770 mg/day) could be effective in increasing TAS in the CrossFit®training program. 4.3.Muscle Biomarkers After a high-intensity CrossFit®training program, a process of muscle tissue break- down and dumping of intramyocellular contents into the systemic circulation is initi- ated [ 38].Sustained and intense WODs can initiate a signiﬁcant elevation of several plasma stress mediators as markers of circulating muscle damage [ 33].These biomarker eleva- tions are indicative of increased EIMD [ 5], which negatively inﬂuences the performance and/or health of athletes [ 29].EIMD increases muscle enzyme activity [ 21]; similarly, CG non-supplemented athletes showed increased muscle enzyme activity, with serum LDH levels being signiﬁcantly higher at T2 and T3 than baseline.
However, muscle damage biomarkers showed a slight downward trend in TTsupplemented athletes, especially on LDH plasma levels, where their behavior was statistically signiﬁcant ( p< 0.05) com- pared to the non-supplemented. Overall, muscle biomarker levels of the participants in the IG were lower than those of the CG after the exercise, but this decrease was not statistically signiﬁcant.Supplementation of TTat higher doses or for a longer period could lead to a signiﬁcant improvement.Three previous studies examined muscle damage biomarkers [ 15,39,40] in physically active adult males.In these studies, TTsupplementation demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction for CK activity (during high-intensity training) [ 39] and a non-signiﬁcant decrease [ 15].In addition, LDH activity (during resistance-exercise training) was signiﬁcantly reduced after the administration of 500 mg/day of TTpowder Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2022 ,19, 16158 10 of 13 and extract [ 15].However, Milasius et al.
[ 40] found signiﬁcant increases in CK plasma levels in male endurance athletes supplemented with TT. These differences may be due to bioactive components of TTsupplementation [ 41].TT/acute.ts1smuscle protective action via ﬂavonoids, alkaloids, phenols, and saponins [ 15,39] are necessary to have an antioxidant and/or anti-inﬂammatory effect [ 11,42].Therefore, in tissue injury skeletal muscle, mem- brane permeability would be reduced, thereby reducing the release of muscle-damaging enzymes from skeletal muscle into the blood circulation [ 41].Therefore, such results could suggest that TTmight effectively lessen the muscle damage because of a CrossFit®intense training-based regimen.4.4.Tribulus terrestris L.
Supplementation Human clinical trials reported several side effects after TTtreatment such as: gas- trointestinal problems [ 43,44], gynecomastia [ 45], priapism [ 46], nephrotoxicity [ 47,48], hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity [ 47], sleep disturbances, fatigue, hypertension, and elevated heart rate [ 35,48]. Our athletes have not expressed adverse effects during or after the 6-week supplementation protocol with TT(770 mg/day), and no alterations on hemato- logical biomarkers have been reported.The TT/acute.ts1sdose administered was within the safety range (250 mg–9000 mg) proposed by the Scientiﬁc Committee of the Spanish Agency for Consumer Affairs, Food Safety and Nutrition (AECOSAN) [49].4.5.CrossFit®Training Program A CrossFit®training program was performed looking for athletes to perform move- ments with the highest possible intensity to generate fatigue and induce a certain degree of muscle damage and oxidative stress [ 50,51].
Our CrossFit®training program performed with athletes suggests that the results could be considered accurate, as the evaluated results showed alterations in muscle metabolism and biomarkers of inﬂammation and oxidative status. In addition, the CrossFit®training program increased athletic performance in the Grace test, which could imply suitability as a physical training program.In addition, prolonged periods of intensive exercise training (physical stress conditions) can reduce immunity and decrease red blood cells, hematocrit, and hemoglobin levels [ 20].In our study, no differences were found in hematological biomarkers.Thus, our CrossFit®training program and 6-week supplementation regimen with TT (770 mg/day) could be appropriate.Limitations and Strengths The main limitation was the small sample size, which limits the interpretation of the results.
Gender may be a factor inﬂuencing the severity of muscle damage, oxidative stress, and inﬂammation responses in humans (only male athletes were included). In addition, the percentage of components of the TTsupplement administered was not determined.On the other hand, the strengths of our study were the randomized single-blind placebo-controlled design, the application of CONSORT guidelines, the inclusion of athletic subjects with previous CrossFit®experience, no differences between the two study groups (IG and CG), and the control of dietary intake.5.Conclusions Oral TTsupplementation of 770 mg/day in CrossFit®trained men could slightly attenuate the exercise-induced oxidative stress, muscle damage, and inﬂammation which could be due to the natural antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory properties of TT.There- fore, further studies are needed in this ﬁeld to corroborate the effects of TTon muscle performance/behavior in athletes training at a high intensity.
Practical Applications TTsupplementation could be used during seasons of high physical demand, to inten- sify skeletal muscle recovery and counteract oxidative damage and inﬂammation generated Int.
