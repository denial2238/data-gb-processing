Since transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a potential drug target for improving the outcome of in ﬂammatory/ ﬁbrogenic wound healing, we investigated if L- carnitine can mediate inhibition of the ﬁbrotic response through suppression of TRPV1 activation in human corneal keratocytes (HCK). We determined TRPV1-induced intracellular calcium transients using ﬂuorescence calcium imaging, channel currents by planar patch-clamping, and cell migration by scratch assay for wound healing.The potential L-carnitine effect on TRPV1-induced myo ﬁbroblast transdifferentiation was evaluated by immunocytochemical detection of alpha smooth muscle actin.RT-PCR analysis con ﬁrmed TRPV1 mRNA expression in HCK.L-carnitine (1 mmol/l) inhibited either capsaicin (CAP) (10 µmol/l), hypertonic stress (450 mOsmol/l), or thermal increase (>43 °C) induced Ca2+transients and corresponding increases in TRPV1-induced inward and outward whole-cell currents.
This was accompanied bysuppression of injury-induced increases in myo ﬁbroblast transdifferentiation and cell migration. In conclusion, L-carnitine contributes to inhibit stromal scarring through suppressing an injury-induced intrinsic TRPV1 activity that is linked with induction of myo ﬁbroblast transdifferentiation in HCK cells.Introduction Human corneal keratocytes (HCK) or ﬁbroblasts are inter- spersed between orthogonally arranged layers of collagenlamellae in the stroma.They are essential for maintaining corneal structure and transparency as they express stromal collagen ﬁbers and different constituents of the extracellular matrix [ 1].Under a quiescent condition, HCK elaborate constituents contributing to the formation of an organized collagenous transparent framework stroma, but during expo-sure to various stresses or infection HCK can be induced to undergo transdifferentiation into ﬁbroblasts and myo ﬁbro- blasts.
This transition is essential for inducing the responsesunderlying wound repair and restoration of normal visual function. However, if this response is dysfunctional as a consequence of excessive ﬁbroblast activation and transdif- ferentiation into myo ﬁbroblasts, the cornea can undergo opaci ﬁcation due to excessive irreversible scari ﬁcation [ 2].Injury-induced corneal scarring ﬁbrosis and opaci ﬁcation are mediated through TRPV1 activation upregulating TGF β-expression which in turn promotes keratocyte trans- differentiation into myo ﬁbroblasts and increases in smooth muscle α-actin expression [ 3].
This ﬁnding in concert with the identi ﬁcation of functional expression of TRPV1 on*Stefan Mergler stefan.mergler@charite.de 1Klinik für Augenheilkunde, Charité —Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany 2Institute of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus of the TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany 3School of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Wenzhou MedicalUniversity, Wenzhou, PR China 4Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Kapelle-Ufer 2, 10117 Berlin, Germany 5Department of Ophthalmology, Universitätsmedizin Rostock, Rostock, Germany1234567890();,: 1234567890();,: ﬁbroblasts help explain why this non-selective ion channel is a recognized target to suppress myo ﬁbroblast transdif- ferentiation and corneal scarring. Such an outcome is expected to improve restoration of tissue transparency as a consequence of wound healing induced by severe injury or infection [ 4,5].
On the other hand, there is a caveat to this approach since epithelial TRPV1 activation instead pro- motes wound closure of this tissue. In order to circumvent this complication, intrastromal injection of an antagonistmay be an option if it only blocks TRPV1 on stromal keratocytes and ﬁbroblasts [ 6].Osmoprotective agents have also been identi ﬁed which lessen injury-induced stimulation of signaling pathways promoting tissue scarring during wound healing.Carnitine is one such agent ( β-hydroxy- γ-N-trimethylaminobutyric acid) [ 7].It is a nutritional supplement widely distributed in foods of animal origin.A protective effect of L-carnitine was described in retinal pigment epithelial cells [ 8] and human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) [ 9,10].In con- junctival epithelial cells (HCjEC), L-carnitine reduced hypertonic-induced cell shrinkage through interacting withTRPV1 channels [ 11].
L-carnitine also functions as an osmoprotectant to suppress in ﬂammatory responses via inhibiting TRPV1 linked signaling pathway in hyper-osmotically stressed HCEC [ 9]. Finally, L-carnitine reduced oxidative stress-induced upregulation and stimulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MPs) activity resulting fromexposure to hyperosmolarity in HCEC [ 10,12].These results prompted us to determine if L-carnitine application also reduces corneal stromal responses underlying opaci ﬁ- cation through inhibiting TRPV1 activation on HCK.We show here that L-carnitine suppresses TRPV1 activa- tion induced by exposure to either capsaicin (CAP), elevatedtemperature, or hypertonic stress in HCK.In addition, L- carnitine suppressed injury-induced increases in HCK migration.Its potential usefulness as a therapeutic agent wasdemonstrated by showing that it inhibited TRPV1-induced keratocyte transdifferentiation into myo ﬁbroblasts.
This result is relevant since it is known that this transition underliescorneal scarring and opaci ﬁcation, which can be symptomatic in patients chronically af ﬂicted with stromal infection. Materials and methods Cell culture of HCK SV40-immortalized HCK cells derived from a human cor- nea were used as a representative cell model of corneal keratocytes [ 13–15].HCK identity was validated based on conﬁrming speci ﬁc keratocyte biomarker expression [ 4].Cells were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum as well as penicillin/streptomycin in a humidi ﬁed5% CO 2incubator at 37 °C.For the electrophysiological measurements, cell con ﬂuence ranged between 60 and 80%.Over this range of con ﬂuence, their electrophysiological characteristics were invariant [ 4].RNA isolation, RT-PCR, and sequencing HCK cells were seeded in T25 ﬂasks and grown to con- ﬂuence.Total RNA was extracted using TriFastTM(PeqLab, by VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manu- facturer ’s instructions.
RNA concentration and purity were determined with a NanoPhotometer ™(Implen GmbH, Munich, Germany) and it was stored at −80 °C until further use. RNA (1.8 µg per sample) was reverse transcribed with RevertAid H minus ﬁrst strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, USA) according to the manufacturer´s instructions in a total volume of 20 µl, and cDNA was stored at−80 °C until further use.PCR was performed with a 2 µl cDNA mixture in a total volume of 35 µl using Taq poly- merase and 0.2 nmol/µl of each forward and reverse primer (intron spanning, 5 ′‑CCCCCGATAGCTCCTACAAC ‑3′ and 3 ′‑AAGGCCTTCCTCATGCACT ‑5′, TRPV1 mRNA accession number NM_018727) after initial 95 °C for 3 min over 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for45 s, ﬁnalized by 72 °C for 7 min and a temperature hold at 4 °C in a Techne TC-512 gradient thermal cycler (Staf- fordshire, UK), yielding a 295 bp product.
Samples withRNAse- and DNAse-free H 2O instead of cDNA template and samples that were proceeded without reverse tran- scriptase in the reverse transcription reaction served as non-template controls. Total RNA from a con ﬂuent human cor- neal endothelial cell line (HCEC-12) served as positive control [ 16].PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel at 120 V for 1.75 h and visualized with ethidium bromide.Bands were cut out and DNA was eluted from the agarose using MP Biomedicals ™Geneclean ™Turbo Kit (Thermo Fisher) in a total elute volume of 30 µl.Eluted PCR products were sequenced (Euro ﬁns Genomics GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany) and sequencing results were checkedwith NCBI Blast ®software ( https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ).Fluorescence calcium imaging HCK cells were pre-incubated with culture medium con- taining 1 µmol/l fura-2/AM for ≈40 min.
The loading was stopped with a Ringer-like (control) solution containing (mmol/l): 150 NaCl, 6 CsCl, 1 MgCl 2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, and 1.5 CaCl 2at pH 7.4 and 317 mOsmol/l [ 17]. At room temperature ( ≈23 °C), intracellular free Ca2+([Ca2+]i) levels were measured based on fura-2 emission at 510 nm resulting from alternating excitation in a 5 s loop at 340 and380 nm with a digital imaging system (Olympus Europa Holding GmbH, Hamburg, Germany).Cells were culturedL-carnitine suppresses transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 activity and myo ﬁbroblast...681 on coverslips (diameter 15 mm) and put in a chamber con- taining the aforementioned Ringer-like solution.Single cells were selected and designated as regions of interest.Cells were exposed to UV-light within a 5-s interval using a LED light source (LED-Hub by Omikron, Rodgau-Dudenhofen, Ger- many).
The images were simultaneously recorded with adigital camera (Olympus XM-10) and f 340nm/f380nm ﬂuores- cence ratios, which are proportional to [Ca2+]i, were calcu- lated by cellSens software (Olympus Europa Holding GmbH,Hamburg, Germany). Fluorescence ratios were normalized (control set to 0.1) and averaged (with error bars) and results shown as mean traces of the f 340nm/f380nm ratio ± SEM (error bars in both directions) with n -values indicating the number of experiments per data point.Ca2+increases were time delayed because drugs were pipetted into a stationary bath rather thanaﬂow through system.L-carnitine effects were evaluated following a 30 min preincubation period.Drug stock solutions were prepared with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dilutedto obtain a nontoxic working concentration wherein DMSO did not exceed 0.1%.
Hypertonic stress (i.e., 450 mOsmol/l) was imposed by supplementing isotonic Ringer-like solutionwith 130 mmol/l D-mannitol to obtain a hypertonic Ringer- like solution. Scratch wound cell migration assay HCKs were incubated in 12-well plates for 48 h until the cells reached con ﬂuence, which was then scratched using a pipette tip.The cell layer was subsequently washed twice with PBS, and then fresh medium was added.The non-treated cellsserved as controls whereas those treated with 1 mmol/l L-carnitine were incubated for either another 8 or 24 h.Images were acquired at 0, 8, and 24 h post treatment usingphase-contrast microscopy with a ×10 objective lens.The open wound areas were calculated using Image software (3 replicates).Immunocytochemistry HCK cells were cultured for 3 days in 12-well cell culture plates.
Before ﬁxation, HCK cells were stimulated for 24 h with 5 ng/ml human recombinant transforming growthfactor beta 1 (TGF β1, ab50036, Abcam, Cambrigde, United Kingdom), 10 µmol/l capsazepine (CPZ), 1 mmol/l L-car- nitine, 5 ng/ml TGF β1 plus 10 µmol/l CPZ, whereas 5 ng/ml TGF β1 plus 1 mmol/l L-carnitine with Dulbecco ’s Modi ﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) served as a control. Vital cells were ﬁxed for 30 min using 4% formaldehyde, followed by washing three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.6, 10 min each).Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton- X100 (15 min) and blocked with 5% BSA in TBS for60 min.HCK cells were incubated overnight in a humidi ﬁed chamber at 4 °C with primary alpha-smooth muscle actin(αSMA) antibodies (1:200, 701457, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) diluted in 0.8% BSA in TBS.Fluores- cence detection employed Cy3 conjugated secondary anti- bodies (1:200, C2306; Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, Missouri, USA) and DAPI nuclear counterstaining.
Mounted slides were examined using light microscopy (Axio Imager.M2;Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Planar patch-clamp recordings HCK whole cell currents were evaluated as previouslydescribed [ 4].In brief, a standard intracellular solution con- taining (mmol/l): 50 CsCl, 10 NaCl, 60 CsF, 20 EGTA, and 10 HEPES at pH ≈7.2 and ≈288 mOsmol/l was applied to the microchip (both provided by Nanion, Munich, Germany).The external solution contained (mmol/l): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl 2,2C a C l 2, 5 D-glucose monohydrate, and 10 HEPES, pH≈7.4 and osmolarity ≈298 mOsmol/l.Mean membrane capacitance (17 ± 6 pF; n=7) and mean access resistance (7 ±2MΩ;n=7) were calculated by the software.Series resistances, fast and slow capacitance transients were com-pensated by the ampli ﬁer in conjunction with the PatchMaster software.Current recordings were all leak-subtracted and cells with leak currents above 100 pA were discarded.Cells weredepolarized every 5 s from −60 to+130 mV in 500 ms steps (voltage ramp).
The holding potential (HP) was set to 0 mV in order to eliminate any possible contribution by voltage-dependent Ca 2+channel activity. Experiments were started ~10 min after breaking into a whole-cell con ﬁguration [ 18].Resulting currents were normalized using cell membranecapacitance to obtain current density (pA/pF).Statistical analysis Parametric Student ’st-test for paired and unpaired data was used to determine if the data passed the normality test.Otherwise, the nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used.Pvalues < 0.05 were considered as signi ﬁcant.All values in the bar charts are shown as means ± SEM (error bars in bothdirections).Signi ﬁcance was determined using the Graph- Pad Prism software (version 5.00 for Windows) (La Jolla, California, USA).The bar charts were generated with thesame software.All other plots were generated with the SigmaPlot software version 12.5 for Windows (Systat Software, San Jose, California, USA).
Results TRPV1 expression and function in HCK Figure 1A provides a result consistent with TRPV1 gene expression based on obtaining the predicted 295 bp682 E. Turan et al.RT-PCR product with intron-spanning speci ﬁc primers.Its identity was con ﬁrmed based on the amplicon sequencing result (data not shown).Negative signals in the non- template control reactions as well as those obtained with intron-spanning primers con ﬁrmed speci ﬁc ampli ﬁcation of only cDNA and excluded primer binding to genomic DNA.HCEC-12 were used as a positive control since TRPV1gene expression was documented in earlier studies [ 16].In addition, Fig.1B–D con ﬁrm functional TRPV1 expression based on using CAP and the speci ﬁc TRPV1 blocker AMG 9810 [ 19].Speci ﬁcally, extracellular application of 20 µmol/ l CAP increased the ﬂuorescence ratio ( f340/f380) from 0.1011 (100 s) ± 0.0002 to 0.1068 ± 0.0021 after 300 s ( n=21;p< 0.005; Fig.1B, D).
In the presence of 10 µmol/l AMG 9810, this CAP-induced Ca2+increase could be clearly suppressed to 0.1001 ± 0.0010 at 300 s ( n=23;p< 0.005; Fig.1C, D). Whole cell patch-clamp recordings are also supportive of functional TRPV1 expression in HCK since 10 µmol/l CAPinduced increases in whole cell currents (Fig.2).These increases were evaluated based on the plots of the corre- sponding current voltage relationships at the time pointsdesignated as: A, B and C (Fig.2A, B).At positive potentials, this TRPV1 agonist increased the typical out- ward TRPV1-like rectifying currents from 172 ± 71 pA/pFto 281 ± 117 pA/pF ( n=7;p< 0.05) ( n=7;p< 0.05) (Fig.2B, C).Similarly, maximal inward current amplitudes induced by a voltage step from 0 to −60 mV increased to −66 ± 32% of control ( n=7;p< 0.005) (Fig.2D).Max- imal outward current amplitudes induced by a voltage step from 0 to +130 mV increased to 173 ± 13% of control (control set to 100%) ( n=7;p< 0.01) (Fig.2E).
L-carnitine inhibits TRPV1 activation Figure 2shows that L-carnitine (1 mmol/l) suppressed CAP- induced increases of whole-cell currents induced by a vol-tage step from −60 to+130 mV. CAP (10 µmol/l) increased both in- and outward currents, whereas 1 mmol/l L-carnitine suppressed them from −32 ± 13 pA/pF to −11 ± 6 pA/pF (n=7;p< 0.05) (Fig.2A–C) and outward current density was suppressed from 281 ± 117 pA/pF to 225 ± 109 pA/pF (both n=7;p< 0.05) (Fig.2C).Similarly, maximal inward current amplitudes induced by a voltage step from 0 to −60 mV decreased them to 112 ± 16% of control ( n=7; p< 0.005) (Fig.2D) and maximal outward current ampli- tudes induced by a voltage step from 0 to +130 mV decreased to 108 ± 12% of control ( n=7;p< 0.01) (control set to 100%) (Fig.2E).Similarly, extracellular application of 10 µmol/l CAP increased the ﬂuorescence ratio ( f 340/f380) rose from 0.1001 (100 s) ± 0.0003 to 0.1218 ± 0.0055 after 300 s ( n=21;p< 0.005; Fig.3A, C).
With HCK cell pas- sage 79, this increase was suppressed in the presence of 1 mmol/l L-carnitine ( f340/f380=0.1011 ± 0.0004; t=300 s; n=29; p< 0.005) (Fig. 3B, C).Similar results were obtained using HCK at earlier cell passages (P69, Fig.3C).Raising the bath temperature to >43 °C, which typically activates TRPV1 [ 20], increased the f 340/f380 ratio from 0.1002 ± 0.0003 (100 s) to 0.1971 ± 0.0068 after 300 s (n=205; p< 0.005; Fig.4A, C).This increase fell to Fig.1 TRPV1 gene and functional expression in HCK.A RT-PCR analysis of TRPV1 expression using gene speci ﬁc primers revealed TRPV1 in HCK (lane 1) and HCEC-12 (positive control, lane 4).Template-free negative controls (lane 2: template replaced with H 2O, lane 3: w/o reverse transcriptase in the reverse transcription reaction)gave no bands.M=100 bp plus DNA ladder.B20 µmol/l CAP induced an increase in Ca 2+inﬂux ( n=21) in HCK.CSame experiment as shown in B, but in the presence of AMG 9810.

Following preexposure to 1 mmol/l L-carnitine in isotonic medium, the ﬂuorescence ratio remained constant following substitution of 450 mOs- mol/l Ringer-like solution containing L-carnitine ( n=73; p> 0.05) (Fig. 5B, C).In summary, these results con ﬁrm that 1 mmol/l L-carnitine acts as a TRPV1 antagonist in HCK cells.L-carnitine suppresses TRPV1-induced HCK migration The effect of 1 mmol/l L-carnitine on HCK migration was calculated as a percentage based on the difference between the initial wound area at time point 0 h and theremaining wound area after 8 h in the presence and absence of carnitine.Figure 6A–E shows the two wound edges at 0 h in the control and with 1 mmol/l L-carnitine after 8 h.The distance separating the wound edges was larger with L-carnitine ( n=30;p< 0.05).

Current densities are shown before application (labeledasA), during application of 10 µmol/l CAP (labeled as B) and after addition of 1 mmol/l L-carnitine (labeled as C). Calculated current densities obtained by normalizing currents to membrane capacitance asfunction of imposed voltage were derived from the traces shown in A.CSummary of patch-clamp experiments with CAP and L-carnitine.The asterisks (*) indicate statistically signi ﬁcant differences of whole- cell currents with and without CAP ( n=7;p< 0.05; paired tested) and signiﬁcant difference of CAP-induced increased with and without L-carnitine ( n=7;p< 0.05; paired tested).DMaximal negative cur- rent amplitudes induced by a voltage step from 0 to −60 mV are depicted in percent of control values before application of 10 l/l CAP (control set to 100%).CAP-induced inward currents could be clearly suppressed in the presence of 1 mmol/l L-carnitine.

Turan et al.HCK migration to proceed for 24 h, the area of the open wound was 30% larger than in the control (control =26 ± 7%; 1 mmol/l L-carnitine =56 ± 3%; n=4;p<0 .0 5 ) , indicating that L-carnitine inhibited wound closure(Fig.6F–L).Moreover, the TRPV1 channel blocker cap- sazepine (CPZ) (10 µmol/l) as a positive control almost completely inhibited wound closure since the area of theopen wound area was 66% larger than in the control (control =26 ± 7%; 10 µmol/l CPZ =92 ± 4%; n=3–4; p< 0.005) (Fig.6H, K, L).On the other hand, the open wound area in samples with 1 mmol/l L-carnitine was 15% smaller than that in samples with 10 µmol/l CPZ (Fig.6L).
This difference suggests that CPZ ef ﬁcacy in inhibiting HCK migration is greater than that of L-carnitine.L-carnitine suppresses myo ﬁbroblast transdifferentiation The functional contribution of TRPV1 in controlling the HCK transdifferentiation into myo ﬁbroblasts was evaluated by determining if L-carnitine inhibited TGF β-induced keratocyte transdifferentiation into myo ﬁbroblasts [ 21]. This is a relevant approach since corneal injury leads to opaci ﬁcation as a consequence of TGF β-induced TRPV1 upregulation followed by increases in keratocyte transdif-ferentiation into myo ﬁbroblasts.Accordingly, the ability of L-carnitine to suppress HCK transdifferentiation was investigated by immunostaining against the myo ﬁbroblast biomarker αSMA in the cytoplasm.Preincubation with 5 ng/ml TGF βfor 24 h increased αSMA-positive cyto- plasmic staining, which is indicative of myo ﬁbroblast transdifferentiation (Fig.7)[21].In the untreated control cultures, cytoplasmic αSMA staining was absent.
During Fig. 3 L-carnitine suppressed CAP-induced increases of intracel- lular Ca2+concentration.A 10 µmol/l CAP induced an increase in Ca2+inﬂux (n=21) in HCK (P79) whereas non-treated control cells maintained a constant Ca2+baseline ( n=9).BSame experiment as shown in A, but in the presence of L-carnitine (HCK P79).L-carnitine (1 mmol/l) clearly suppressed the CAP-induced Ca2+increase ( n= 29).CSummary of the experiments with CAP and L-carnitine in HCK from two different cell passages (P69, P79).The asterisks (*) designatesigniﬁcant increases in [Ca 2+]iwith CAP ( t=300 s; n=9–21;p< 0.01 at the minimum; paired tested) compared to control ( t=100 s).The hashtags (#) indicate statistically signi ﬁcant differences in ﬂuor- escence ratios between CAP with and without L-carnitine ( t=300 s; n=9–29;p< 0.005; non-paired tested).Fig.4 L-carnitine suppressed heat-induced increases of intracel- lular Ca2+concentration.

Speci ﬁcally, in the presence of TGF β1 plus L-carnitine, there was a slight reduction in αSMA-positive cytoplasmic staining, whereas TGF β1 plus CPZ resulted in a more prominent reduction in cytoplasmicαSMA immunostaining. Nevertheless, the similarity between these two trends suggests that L-carnitine reduced TRPV1 activation by TGF β.Discussion Functional TRPV1 expression We document here gene and functional TRPV1 expression in an immortalized HCK cell line (Figs.1,2A,3A) based inpart on the effects of CAP and AMG 9810, which are validated TRPV1 channel modulators [ 19,22].Its presence agrees with similar previous studies in primary HCK cells and corneal ﬁbroblasts [ 4,5].The electrophysiological responses that are signatures of TRPV1 activity such as outwardly rectifying currents, a reverse potential near 0 mV(Fig.2B) and CAP-induced current rises as well as increased Ca 2+inﬂuxes (Figs.1–3) are very similar to those described in other corneal cell types [ 4,16,23].
In addition, its invariant expression irrespective of cell passage number also supports the relevance of this cell model. Increased Ca2+inﬂux upon raising the temperature above 43 °C (Fig.4A) or exposure to 450 mOsmol/l hypertonic stress (Fig.5A) further indicated functional TRPV1 expression [24,25].These responses are pertinent to the in vivo con- dition since TRPV1 activation is documented to be induced by such stresses and it is alleged to contribute to dry eye symptomology.Speci ﬁcally, the imposed hypertonic stress is also relevant because it is an established marker used to diagnose dry eye disease [ 26–28].It is likely that this imposed stress is pertinent to dry eye induced ocularpain even though in these patients the hyperosmotic threshold for inducing pain through TRPV1 activation is unclear [ 29].
L-carnitine suppresses responses linked to TRPV1 activation Even though L-carnitine is a TRPV1 antagonist in some other ocular cell types [ 11], such an effect had not been previously described in immortalized HCK cells. Never- theless, L-carnitine eye drop supplementation in arti ﬁcial tears helps relieve some dry eye symptomology [ 30].Pre- vious to the current study it was only known that L-carnitine acts as an osmoprotectant and inhibitor of MAPK signaling pathway-induced stimulation of proin ﬂammatory cytokine release [ 7,10].Here we show that part of therapeutic effect of arti ﬁcial tears supplemented with L-carnitine likely stems from its inhibition of TRPV1-induced keratocyte transdif-ferentiation into myo ﬁbroblasts.This conclusion is based on showing that L-carnitine suppressed the following TRPV1- induced responses: (1) 1 mmol/l L-carnitine reduced CAP-induced increases of the whole-cell currents (Fig.2) and corresponding rises in intracellular Ca 2+levels (Fig.3).
(2) L-carnitine reduced both rises in TRPV1 activity inducedby hyperosmolarity and a rise in temperature (Figs. 4,5).Speci ﬁcally, hyperosmolarity induced by D-mannitol sup- plementation induced increases in intracellular Ca 2+that could be suppressed by 1 mmol/l L-carnitine (Fig.5B, C).This inhibitory effect is similar to the one described in HCjEC [ 11].(3) However, L-carnitine is not such an effective antagonist as CPZ since at a concentration 100- fold higher than CPZ L-carnitine had inhibitory effects on Fig.5 L-carnitine suppressed hypertonic stress-induced increases of intracellular Ca2+concentration.A Hypertonic challenge (450 mOsmol/l) induced an increase in Ca2+inﬂux (n=55) whereas non- treated control cells maintained a constant Ca2+baseline ( n=13).BSame experiment as shown in A, but in the presence of L-carnitine.L-carnitine (1 mmol/l) clearly suppressed the hypertonic-induced Ca2+ increase ( n=73).CSummary of the experiments with hypertonicity and L-carnitine.

In another study, loss of TRPV1 function impaired healing of an incision stromal wound in mice [ 3,31]. This delay wasattributed to a lessening of αSMA upregulation, fewer terminally differentiated myo ﬁbroblasts delimiting the wound edge and less TGF βupregulation [ 3].These differ- ences may indicate that functional TRPV1 expression contributes to controlling the HCK phenotype since L-carnitine blunted increases in myo ﬁbroblast transdiffer- entiation induced by TGF βstimulation of TRPV1, albeit to a lesser extent than CPZ (Fig.7).Our ﬁndings support several preliminary studies showing that blockingTRPV1 suppressed myo ﬁbroblast formation and expression of TGF β1 in cultured keratocytes or ocular ﬁbroblasts [31,32].The inhibition of TRPV1-driven HCK migration by L-carnitine shown in Fig.

Novel strategies are needed to block these TRPV1 mediated responses induced by TRPV1 activation.The results of the current study suggest that blocking TRPV1 activation on keratocytes with antagonists such as carnitine may prove to be a viable approach to suppresscorneal opaci ﬁcation in a clinical setting.
