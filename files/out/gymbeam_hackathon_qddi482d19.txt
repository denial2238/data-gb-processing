This study aimed to iden-tify insights of AS users regarding their knowledge andpatterns of AS use, commonly experienced side effects,sources used for steroid education, and their unique needsas a population. Study Design: AS users from Calgary,Alberta, Canada of various sexes and ages ≥18 were re- cruited through gyms in Alberta with convenience andsnowball sampling techniques.Participant-centered-quali-tative research using semi-structured interviews was con-ducted.Participants discussed their experiences as a userand shared their understanding of AS, details of usage in-cluding compounds used, and their commonly experiencedor perceived side effects through one-on-one interviews ofvarying durations.Interviews were coded using NVivo 14 Software prior to thematic analysis.Resulting codes were organized into overarching themes based on researchers ’ consensus.Results: Seven AS users were con ﬁdentially in- terviewed over Zoom.
Several important themes emerged.There existed a wide variety of AS that users have identi-ﬁed, with some of the most commonly mentioned being Anavar, Nolvadex, Testosterone, and Trenbolone. Steroidusers frequently identi ﬁed increased strength with faster recovery from training and better overall appearance as prominent advantages of AS use.Conversely, hair loss, gynecomastia, acne, aggression, erectile dysfunction, al-tered libido, hypogonadism, infertility, and injection re-lated discomfort were commonly identi ﬁed disadvantages of AS use.Lastly, individuals using AS report having con-sulted many different sources to learn about appropriatedosing, techniques, and side effects.These sources rangedfrom peers, coaches, online forums, social media, and scien-tiﬁc research articles, but rarely included healthcare pro- fessionals.
Conclusions: This study identi ﬁed the need for education and research in exploring the impact of AS use.A variety of AS exist on the market, yet information per-taining to the side effect pro ﬁles of these AS from a patient ’s perspective is lacking and exploration of this topic is war-ranted. Further investigation as to the impact of user edu-cation on their understanding of the risks versus thebeneﬁts of AS use must also be conducted.Presentation: 6/1/2024 1University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA;2University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;3University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United KingdomJournal of the Endocrine Society | https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvae163 | A529 J Endocrine Soc, Volume 8, Issue Supplement_1, October –November 2024 A529
