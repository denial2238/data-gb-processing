A total of 50 Ross 308 broilers were cla ssified according to the following feeding regime for two weeks: basal diet (NC), basal diet+0.1% fish collagen (PC), basal diet+0.1% pig skin collagen (T1), basal diet+0.5% p ig skin collagen (T2), and basal diet+1.0% pig skin collagen (T3). The moisture content wa s the highest in the PC group, and the protein content was the lowest in the T1 group ( p<0.05).The fat content was higher in the T1 and PC groups, whereas the ash content was higher in the T3 group (p<0.05).Drip loss was the highest in the NC group and the low est in the T2 group (p<0.05).Lightness was low in groups T2 and T3, redness was lo w in groups T2 and PC, and yellowness was low in groups T1, T2, and PC (p<0.05).The c ollagen content of the chicken breast was the highest in the T3 group, and that of the skin was the highest in the T1 group (p<0.05).The texture characteristics of springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness, and hardness were the highest in the T3 group (p<0.05).
In conclusi on, the supplementation of a broiler diet with pig skin collagen was found to increase the c ollagen content of the breast meat, indicating the improved quality of the broiler breast mea t. Keywords broiler meat, pig skin, collagen, drip loss, texture characteri stics Introduction Meat and meat products play an important role in the human diet a s t h e y p r o v i d e proteins and essential amino acids that are difficult to obtain from vegetables and fruits (Kushi et al., 2006).In particular, poultry meat is preferred by consumers owing to its nutritional value as well as cost (Stanciu, 2020).The average poultry meat consumption of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and De velopment (OECD) member countries was 31.7 kg/capita in 2020, which reflects an increase of approximately 5 kg from 26.57 kg/capita in 2010.In contrast, t he world’s average poultry meat consumption was 14.88 kg/capita in 2020, compared to approximately 12.73 kg/capita in 2010.
The consumption of poultry meat in the United States was 50.1 kg/capita in 2020, whereas it was 14 kg/capita in China, a nd 18.7 kg/capita in ARTICLE Pig Skin Collagen Supplementation for Improved Broiler Breast M eat 675 Korea (OECD, 2020). Poultry production and consumption have inc reased significantly over the past 40–50 years, and are expected to increase further, especially in developing countrie s, making chicken the most valuable source of meat protein for the growing world population (Baldi et al., 2020; OECD and FAO, 2020).In a survey of 1,100 adult men and women aged between 20 and 69 years old in Korea, the annual consumption of chicken was found to have in creased due to easy delivery and online purchases, despite the challenges introduced by COVI D-19.When purchasing chicke n m e a t a t h o m e , t h e f i r s t criterion was freshness (63.6%), followed by price (39.9%), mea t quality (36.9%), and expiration date (29.1%).
In addition, th e most common improvement for promoting chicken consumption was p roviding grade-based information (83.7%) and soft- textured meat (93.5%) (Rural Development Administration, 2020). The livestock industry focuses on health -oriented livestock products.In particular, meat processing products were develope d to meet the requirements of modern consumers who prioritize improved living standards, diet, and food safety (Hafez and Att ia, 2020).Therefore, chicken products have been improved in various ways, such as changing t he cooking methods and developi ng partial meat products (Kook et al., 2020).Most waste in the meat industry is generated during slaughterin g, which raises concerns for environmental protection and sustainability (Russ and Meyer-Pittroff, 2004).The slaughter b y-products include bones, tendons, skin, gastrointestinal contents, blood, and internal organs (Grosse, 1984).
These can be generally utilized as food o r reprocessed as secondary by- products in agriculture and industry (Liu, 2002). Many studies have been conducted to utilize the slaughter by-products (Jayathilakan et al., 2012; Min et al., 2017; Mirzapour-Kouhdas ht et al., 2020).Collagen is an animal protein that accounts f or approximately 30% of the animal protein and can be easily obtai ned from livestock, including fish, pigs, and chicken (Aberoumand, 2012; Cheng et al., 2009; Huo and Zheng, 2009; Muy onga et al., 2004; Pataridis et al., 2008).It provides strength and support to the skin, bone, cartilage, tendon, and blood vessels, and plays a major role in the extracellular matr ix (Erdmann et al., 2008; Mendis et al., 2005; Ngo et al., 2011).Collagen forms a scaffold for tissue treatment and wound healin g and is used in applications related to drug delivery systems in the urology, biotechnology, and medical fields (Nune et al., 2017).
In the food industry, collagen is used in protein supple ments, fragrances, gelling agents, emulsifiers, and additives aimed at improving texture (N azeer and Kumar, 2012). The ingred ients in poultry feed are high in methionine and lysine and should be a source of energy and minerals.Collagen is high in methionine (6%) and lysine (19%), so it plays an important role as a feed supplement in the poultry industry (Nazeer et al., 20 11).Proper protein feed is important for broiler growth and me at quality (Beski et al., 2015).Many studies have focused on impr oving the meat quality of chicken through feed supplementation using natural products and by-products, such as collagen (Choi, 2005; Park et al., 2005; Woo et al., 2007).Supplementation with hydrolyzed collagen is known to have a positive impact on tibial dimensions, strength, and the mineral content of broiler s (Güz et al., 2019).
Collagen feeding can play an important role in increasing the muscle content of the broiler, and the colla gen component proline can provide a higher initial growth rate than other amino acids, and thereby is a necessary ingredient. Therefore, collagen-related studies have focused on extracting collagen from by-products produced by the livestock and fish industries and using it as an effective supplement for alternat ive feed (Nurubhasha et al., 20 19).The current study aimed to improve the availability of pig skin, which is a by-product of the pig industry, to enhance the quality of broiler breast meat .Materials and Methods Pig skin collagen extract Six liters of distilled water and 3 kg of pig skin were put int o an electronic pressure extractor (KS 220S, Kyungseo E&P, Incheon, Korea) at 80℃ for 5 h.After heating, the insoluble co llagen was strained through the gauze.The collagen extract Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.41, No.
4, 2021 676 was hydrolyzed at 60℃ for 5 h using protease (Love Me Tender, H GROUP USA LLC, Atlanta, GA, USA) and concentrated at 80℃ for 12 h. The collagen extract was cooled at room temper ature for 20 min and filtered to 9,450 daltons using a 10,000-dalton filter (Multi-Angle Light Scattering, Korea Basic Science Institute, Daejeon, Korea).The final collagen extracted from pig skin was store d at 4℃ for 24 h and used for feed additive.Experimental design and animals Fifty Ross 308 broilers, two weeks old with an average weight o f 322±0.3 g, were housed for two weeks before the experiment.The experiment was conducted with five random, comp letely blocked treatments, classified into the following groups: the negative control (basal diet, NC), positive control (basal diet+0.1% fish collagen (fish collagen premium power, Graviola House, Korea), PC), T1 (basal diet+0.1% pig skin colla gen), T2 (basal diet+0.5% pig skin collagen), and T3 (basal diet+1.0% pig skin collagen) groups.
The basal diet met or exce eded the National Research Council (NRC, 1994) requirements. All broilers were allowed to consume both feed an d water ad libitum .After completing the two-week feeding regime, the tibial bone size, weight and skin thickness of the broilers were measured and the left breast was harvested for meat quality analysis.Analysis method In this study, five replicates of the same treatment were prepa red and analyzed.The average v alue was considered the result.General components Moisture, fat, protein, and ash (%) were measured in accordance with the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists method (AOAC, 2012).pH pH was measured after adding 50 mL of distilled water to 5 g of breast meat sample.All samples were homogenized for 30 s using a homogenizer (StomacherⓇ400 Circulator, Seward, UK) and the pH was measured using a pH meter (Mettler Toledo Delta 340, Mettler-Toledo, Leicester, UK).
Water-holding capacity The water-holding capacity was estimated by the centrifugation method as reported by Laakkonen et al. (1970).The crushed sample (0.5±0.05 g) was placed in the upper filter tube of the centrifuge tube, heated in an 80℃ water bath for 20 min, and cooled thereafter for 10 min.The centrifuge tube cent rifuged for 10 min at 3,360×g.It is displayed as the ratio of the remaining sample weight / the sample weight before heating.Texture characteristics and shear force To measure the texture characteristics of the sample, the masti cation test, shear, and cutting tests were performed using a rheometer (COMPAC-100, Sun Scientific, Tokyo, Japan), and the s ample was placed at right angles to the direction of the muscle fibers in a 3cm-thick steak shape.The muscle was sheare d and heated to an internal temperature of 70℃, and then allowed to cool under running wat er for 30 min.
From the cooled sample, a 1-cm-diameter core wa s drilled in a cylindrical shap e Pig Skin Collagen Supplementation for Improved Broiler Breast M eat 677 along the muscle fiber direction to collect the sample and then cut in the direction perpendicular to the muscle fiber using a rheometer (Compac-100, Sun Scien tific) to measure the shear for ce. The measurement was repeated three or more times.Drip loss After shaping a 2-cm-thick sample into a circle (100±5 g), it w as put in a polypropylene bag and vacuum packed.The amount of drip loss generated during storage in a refrigerator at 4℃ for 24 h was measured as the weight ratio (%) of the initial sample.Cooking loss After shaping a 3-cm-thick sampl e into a circle (150±5 g), it w as put into a polypropylene ba g, vacuum packed, and heated in a 70℃ water bath for 40 min, followed by cooling for 30 min.The weight lost after heating was measured as the weight ratio (%) of the first sample.
Hunter color measurement The surface color of the breast meat was measured using a spect rophotometer (Model JX-777, Color Techno. System, Tokyo, Japan) standardized with a white plate (CIE L*, 94.04; C IE a*, 0.13; CIE b*, –0.51), with the CIE L* value on a HunterLab color system representing lightness, the CIE a* value representing redness, and the CIE b* value representing yellowness using a white f luorescent lamp (D65).Collagen measurement Approximately 4 g of sample was placed in an Erlenmeyer flask, and 30 mL of sulfuric acid solution was added to the sample.The flask was covered with a lid and heated in a dry ov en at 105℃ for 16 h.The contents of the flask were transferred to a 500 mL volumetr ic flask, diluted with tertiary distilled water, and homogenized.A Whatman No.2 150 mm filter was used to filter the sample.
The filtrate (5 mL) was d iluted to 100 mL, and 2 mL of the diluted sample was added to a test tube, to which 1 mL of oxidant solution was added, shaken, and finally left at 20℃ to 25℃ for 20 min. Next, 1 mL of a color reagent was added to each test tube, mixed, and these sam ples were incubated in a 60℃ w ater bath for 15 min, cooled under flowing water for 3 min or more, and finally, the absorba nce was measured at a fixed wavelength of 558 nm using a spectrophotometer.For preparation of the standard curve, 2 mL of the working standard solution was taken and its absorbance measured based on color development.The collagen co ntent (g/100 g) was analyzed by substituting the sample absorbance into the regression equation (Kolar, 1990).Measurement of tibial bone siz e, weight, and skin thickness The left tibia bones of each br oiler were removed as drumsticks with the flesh intact.The drumsticks were immersed in boiling water (100℃) for 10 min.
After cooling to room temperat ure, the drumsticks were defleshed by hand and the patella was removed. Then, they were dried for 24 h at room temperature .The tibial length and bone weight were measured.Skin thickness was measured immed iately after slaughter.Fatty acid analysis The sample (50 g) was homogenized in 250 mL of chloroform:metha nol (2:1) solution at 3,000 ppm according to the Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.41, No.4, 2021 678 method of Folch et al.(1957).The lipids were extracted from t he homogeneous solution and sodium anhydrous sulfate was used to remove moisture from the liquid from which the lipids w ere extracted and the filtrate was concentrated at 50℃–55℃.One milliliter of tricosanic acid was added first, followed by 1 mL of 0.5 N NaOH.The sample was heated at 100℃ for 20 min, cooled for 30 min, and 2 mL of BF 3 was added, heated for 20 min, and finally cooled for 30 min.
A fter adding heptane and 4 mL of NaCl, the supernatant was removed and injected into a gas chromatograph to measur e the fatty acid content. Analysis of free amino acids Amino acid analysis was conducted according to the standard ana lysis method proposed by the Livestock Technology Research Institute in 2000 using an amino acid analyzer.Briefl y, 100 mg of sample (approximately 30 mg of crude protein) was placed in a decomposition bottle, and 40 mL of 6 N HCl was added, followed by the injection of nitrogen gas.It was placed in an evaporating flask, c onnected to a rotating evapora tor, and the hydrochloric acid was removed at 50℃.When the evaporation was completed, the distilled water bottle was washe d with distilled water, the contents transferred to the evaporative flask, and evaporation was conducted thrice.
A smal l amount of buffer solution (pH 2.2) or distilled water was added to the final evaporative fl ask to dissolve the amino acid s, and the sample was then filtered through No. 5B filter paper , and the volume was mad e up to 50 mL.This sample was used as th e amino acid analyzer speci men and its absorbance was measured at 570 nm.Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was conducted using the General Linear Mod el (GLM) procedure of the SAS program (Statistical Analysis System 2002, Cary, NC, USA), and the significance of t he comparisons between the means of the treatment groups was verified (p<0.05) using Duncan's multiple range test.Results and Discussion General composition of breast me at from pig skin collagen-fed b roilers Table 1 shows the general composition of the breast meat from p ig skin collagen-fed broilers.While the moisture content was the highest in the PC (74.33%) group, it was the lowest in the T3 group (72.94%).
There was no significant difference between the NC, T1, and T2 groups in terms of moisture content. The protein content was significantly lower in the T1 group than in the NC group, and the PC group showed significantly low protein content.Previous studies reported that the growth of salmon was reduced upon replacing much of the fish protein c oncentrate fed to the fish with gelatin (Mundheim et al., 2004; Opstvedt et al., 2003).Studies have also shown that incr easing the supply of bovine skin gelatin reduced the rate of Table 1.General components of breast me at from pig skin collagen-fed b roilers Treatments NC PC T1 T2 T3 Moisture (%) 73.05±0.36bc 74.33±0.04a 73.33±0.09bc 73.57±0.30b 72.94±0.01c Protein (%) 24.42±0.12a 21.80±0.39c 23.35±0.27b 23.78±0.18ab 24.13±0.35a Fat (%) 1.11±0.21b 2.00±0.26a 2.20±0.18a 1.16±0.25b 1.29±0.08b Ash (%) 1.10±0.04b 1.10±0.00b 1.06±0.02b 1.12±0.02ab 1.18±0.01a NC, basal diet; PC, basal diet+0.

The fatty acid biosynthesis of algae depends upon the supply of dietary carboh ydrates for acetyl-CoA product ion, and when such carbohydrates are ingested, insulin stimulation results in the increased activity of fatty acid syn thase (FAS) and malate dehydrogen ase (MD) (Hillgartner et al., 1995). Most of the fat present in poultry comes from carbohydra tes, and glycolysis and NADPH are essential for the synthesis of fatty acids in the cytoplasm.Therefore, fatty aci d synthesis depends largely upon the supply of carbohydrates from feed and the activity of the glycolytic system (Moon, 2018 ).The significantly higher fat content in the PC group can be attributed to the carbohydrate c ont e nt o f t he f e e d a n d i s n ot t hought to be affected by collagen.The PC group also has a relatively high fat content owing to its low protein content.T able 2 shows that the ash content significantly increased with increases in the collagen levels.
Feeding calf bone-extracted g elatin to early breeding chicks, with high bone hemostatic capability (in 14 days) significantly improved the tibial ash, calcium, and phosphorus content in the chicks. Considering that gelatin can improve bone strength by promoting the mineralizati on of cartilage sheets (Kim et al., 2017), the feeding of pig skin collagen can be assumed to increase the ash content in bro iler breast meat.Quality characteristics of breas t meat from pig skin collagen-f ed broilers Table 2 shows the quality characteristics of the broiler breast meat.The NC group showed significantly higher drip loss than the other treatments, whereas T2 showed the lowest.There was no significant difference between cooking loss and the CIE L* of Hunter color.However, the CIE a* of the T2 and PC gr oups was significantly lower than that of the other treatments, whereas the CIE b* of the T1 group was the lowest.
The collagen content of the skin was significantly higher in the T1 group than in other treatment groups and was the lowest in the T3 group.

A previous study reported a posi tive correlation between drip loss and time in storage, suggesting that the oxidative processes occurring in both the l ipid and protein fractions during storage may alter the water- holding capacity (Lonergan et al ., 2001). However, since there was no significant difference in drip loss and water-holding capacity in this study, the relationship between drip loss and water-holding capacity could not be determined.In this study, the collagen content of the broiler breast meat was found to in crease with the collagen content of the feed, and the T3 group showed a significantly higher content than the NC group.Preced ing studies reported that the human consumption of collagen extracted from pig skin and chic ken feet was likely to affect t he proliferation of fibroblasts and the formation of collagen fibroblasts in collagen-specific ways (Iwai et al., 2005).
The results of the previous study may be related to the difference in the collagen content of the breas t meat of broilers fed pig ski n collagen in this study. Texture characteristics of breas t meat from pig skin collagen-f ed broilers Table 3 shows the texture charact eristics of broiler breast mea t.Springiness and cohesiveness were significantly higher in al l treatment groups relative to those in the NC group, and chewine ss was significantly higher in the T3 group than in the other groups.Hardness was significantly higher in the following orde r: T3, PC, T2, and T1.There was no significant difference in shear force between the treatments.In a previous study, pigs t hat orally ingested feed with collagen peptides were shown to have a higher fibroblast density in the dermis, larger diameter and density of collagen fibrils, and a larger area of collagen than those that ingested the basic diet and feed with lactalbumin (M atsuda et al., 2006).
Small-diameter collagen fibrils are mechanically weaker than thicker ones (Parry et al., 1978), and collagen fibrils are denser due to the proliferation of fibrob lasts in the dermis (Yamamoto et al., 2002). Collagen has been proven to play a key role in determining the meat strength in various livestock, including birds (Sirri et al., 2016).Broilers that ingested pig skin may be expected to have a greater diameter an d higher density of collagen fibrils in the dermis than those in the NC group.As the pig skin-fed broilers had harder meat due to the high density of fibroblasts in the dermis, springiness, coh esiveness, and chewiness of t he meat may also be affected.Bone length, weight, and skin thickness of the breast meat from pig skin collagen-fed broilers Table 4 shows the bone length, weight, and skin thickness of br oiler breast meat.No significant difference between the Table 3.

Although there was no significant difference in the four treatment groups, the bone length tended to increas e in the T1 and T2 groups compared to the NC group and tended to decrease in the T3 group. The addition of gelatin extracted from calf bones to broiler feed is known to result in longer br oiler tibiae than those in the NC group (Beyranvand et al., 2019).In animal experiments, the intake of hydrolyzed collagen by livestock was reported to improve bone density and bone mineral content (Wu et al., 2004).The amount of type I collage n in bone substrate increased when mice consumed hydrolyzed collagen (Nomura et al., 2005).Research has shown t hat the consumption of alkali and acid-treated bone gelatin enhanced the surface area of the small intestine, and consequen tly improved bone properties and the intestinal absorption of phosphorus (van Harn et al., 2017).
There is a report that gela tin intake promotes bone-forming cell differentiation and bone regeneration in broilers and that gelatin can improve bone stre ngth by promoting the mineralization of cartilage sheets (Kim et al., 2017). The results of previous studies show that collag en intake and bone are related, but no significant difference w as observed in this research.Compared to the NC group, there was no significant difference in skin thickness between the T1 and T2 groups, although it was significantly lower in the T3 gr oup.The results of a previous experiment showed that the thickness of the dermis in pigs fed collagen peptide was simila r to that of pigs fed lactalbumin group and the NC group (Matsuda et al., 2006).Analysis of fatty acids and amino acids in breast meat from pig skin collagen-fed broilers Table 5 shows the fatty acid analysis of the broiler breasts.N o significant difference was observed overall.
The γ-linoleic acid (C18:3n6) content was the highest in the NC group (at 16.3 8%) and tended to decrease as the extract content in the treatments increased. The γ-linol eic acid (C18:3n6) content in the PC group was 14.80% and it was the lowest level in the T3 group at 13.59%.Feeding pigs with diets containing conjugated linoleic acid has been reported to significantly increase the L* and a* values of pig tenderloin, although it did not increas e the b* value (Dunshea et al., 2005).As shown in Table 5, the γ-linoleic acid (C18:3n6) content of NC and T1 was high, and as shown in Table 2, the L* and a* values of the NC and T1 groups were high.The results of this study are similar to thos e reported in previous studies.The L* and a* values were attributed to the γ-linoleic acid content (C18:3n6).Table 6 sh ows the amino acid analysis of broiler breast meat.
While there was no significant difference in the overall amino acid content , lysine, histidine, and arginine showed lower levels in the T1 , T2, and T3 groups than in the NC group. Conclusion This study was conducted to investigate the quality of broiler breast meat after feeding broilers pig skin collagen, a by- product of the pig farming industry, and to upgrade broiler bre ast meat to meet the consumer requirements.The protein Table 4.Bone length, weight, and skin thickness of breast meat from pi g skin collagen-fed broilers Treatments NC PC T1 T2 T3 Bone weight (g) 8.92±2.77 8.98±3.35 9.44±2.94 8.90±1.47 7.00±0.19 Bone length (cm) 7.46±1.46 7.66± 0.70 7.72±0.56 7.98±0.52 7.00±0 .24 Skin thickness (cm) 0.37±0.04a 0.31±0.03ab 0.38±0.03a 0.38±0.04a 0.26±0.06b NC, basal diet; PC, basal diet+0.1% fish collagen powder; T1, b asal diet+0.1% collagen; T2, bas al diet+0.5% collagen; T3, basa l diet+1.0% collagen.a,b Means in the same row with different superscripts differ (p<0.0 5).

In terms of Hunter color, CIE L* and the CIE a* value were high in the NC and T1 groups (p<0.05), and the CIE b* was low in the T1 group (p<0.05). Bone weight was the highest in the T1 group, bone length was the shortest in the T3 group, and the skin also was the thinnes t in the T3 group (p<0.05).Therefore, the breast meat of pig skin collagen-fed broilers was of better quality than that of t he NC group.Among them, T3 was considered to have the most improved broiler breast meat quality because it had the highest collagen content, best texture characteristics, and the lowest drip loss, despite the disadvantage of poor skin thickness.Res earch is needed to offset the disadvantages of poor skin thickness for higher meat quality.Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no poten tial conflicts of interest.
