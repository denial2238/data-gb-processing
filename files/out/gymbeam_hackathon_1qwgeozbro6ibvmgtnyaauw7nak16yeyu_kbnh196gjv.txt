Patients or Other Participants: Eleven well-trained, non± heat-acclimated, healthy males (age 52262 years, height 5 181.1 67 cm, mass 578.4 64.2 kg, VÇO2max 550.5 63.4 mL´kg21´min21). Intervention(s): Subjects were supplemented with 21.6 g/d of CrM or placebo for 7 days.On day 7, they performed2hoursof submaximal exercise, alternating 30 minutes of walking with30 minutes of cycling in the heat, resulting in approximately2% dehydration.This was followed by an 80-minute heat tolerancetest (temperature 533.5 60.58C, humidity 541.0 612%), which included 12 repetitions of a 3-minute walk (pace 54.0 60.1miles/h,intensity 537.1 66.1%VÇ O2max)alternatingwitha 1-minute, high-intensity run (pace 511.8 60.4 miles/h, in- tensity 5115.0 65.6% VÇO2max), resulting in an additional 2% decrease in body weight.
Main Outcome Measures: Before supplementation and on day 7 of supplementation, anterior compartment pressure wasmeasured at rest, after dehydration, and at 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, and60 minutes after the heat tolerance test. Analysis of variancewith repeated measures was calculated to compare differenceswithin the trials and time points and to identify any interactionbetween trial and time.Results: The CrM intake was associated with an increase in body weight ( P,.05).A moderate effect size was noted for compartment pressures between the trials for the differencesbetween predehydration and postdehydration ( h 250.414).This effect diminished substantially by 3 minutes after the heattolerance test.Compared with the placebo trial, the change inanterior compartment pressure from rest to dehydration wasgreater, as was the change from rest to 1 minute after the heattolerance test ( P,.05) during the CrM trial.
Conclusions: A 7-day loading dose of CrM increased ante- rior compartment pressures after dehydration and immediatelyafter the heat tolerance tests, but the changes did not inducesymptoms and the pressure changes were transient. Key Words: ergogenic aids, compartment syndrome, ther- moregulation INTRODUCTION Prevalent use of creatine monohydrate (CrM) as a poten- tial ergogenic aid among all levels of athletes has oc-curred since it was demonstrated to aid in the production of adenosine triphosphate, which is important for short-termstrength and power activities.1±10As with any supplement, questions concerning the health effects of CrM have beenraised.To date, the only consistently documented side effectof CrM supplementation has been an increase in body mass.
1±13 Because of this consistent ®nding, CrM supplementation hasbeen used with the primary goal of increasing body mass.Several other anecdotal effects of CrM supplementation havebeen reported in athletic populations, including muscle cramps, gastrointestinal disturbances, increased muscle inju- ries, and compartment syndrome of the quadriceps or lowerleg. 2±17 The increase in body mass reported in the early phase of CrM supplementation has not been attributed to a signi®cantincrease in total muscle mass.3,5,6,10,18Rather, the likely mech- anism is an increase in intracellular water retention.3,5,6,10,18 Creatine monohydrate is a powerful osmolyte that increasesthe water within the cell.19,20Preliminary research has shown that CrM use alters the distribution of ¯uids within the body,with a 2% to 3% increase in intracellular ¯uid.
19,20 Journal of Athletic Training 31Theoretically, the risk of compartment syndrome is in- creased while supplementing with CrM because of the intra-cellular ¯uid retention in the muscle cell and increased overallsize of the muscle tissue. 14±17Under normal conditions with- out CrM supplementation, exercise produces a 20% increasein muscle volume, stemming from an increase in regionalblood volume and increased transcapillary ®ltration of intra-vascular ¯uid beyond the dispersal ability of the lymphatic¯ow.21If this normal increase is coupled with the potentially dangerous entrapment of intracellular water in an osteofascialcompartment, serious medical concerns may exist for individ-uals supplementing with CrM.Schroder et al 16documented that oral CrM supplementation raised resting and postexercise anterior compartment pressure(ACP) and delayed the return of postexercise ACP to restingvalues in the lower leg after 6 and 34 days of CrM supple-mentation compared with a placebo group.
Potteiger et al 17 also demonstrated an increase in ACP in the lower leg at restand following exercise after 7 and 35 days of CrM supple-mentation, with pressures that began to return to normal after28 days of no supplementation. Multipleauthors 15±17havealso demonstrated that select individuals reach exceptionally highresting and postexercise ACPs, which are classi®ed as clinicalvalues for the diagnosis of compartment syndrome.Thesepeo-ple exhibit the signs and symptoms of anterior compartmentsyndrome of the lower leg, including aching, cramping, andburning pain and/or tightness over the area of the anteriorcompartment of the lower leg.In 2000, the American College of Sports Medicine issued a recommendation to avoid CrM supplementation in hot envi-ronments, despite the lack of direct evidence of a link betweenthe development of dehydration or heat illnesses and CrMsup-plementation.
4Since that publication, no authors have exam- ined whether a change in intracellur ¯uid, attributed to CrMsupplementation, is associated with an increase in ACP in thelower leg in the presence of thermal stress. Thus, research isneeded to determine whether such ¯uid serves as a bene®cialsource of stored water to aid the dehydrated person,orwhetherthis ¯uid is a potential hazard of trapped water and leads toincreased compartment pressure.Our purpose was to assess the in¯uence of dehydration (2% to 5% reduction in body weight) and exercise in the heat onresting and postexercise ACP measures of the lower leg intrained individuals ingesting CrM.Ours is the ®rst study toinvestigate the collective effects of CrM use, prolonged andintense exercise, high temperature, and dehydration on ACPmeasurements of the lower leg.
METHODS Subjects Eleven well-trained, non±heat-acclimatedmalesubjects(age 52162 years, height 5181.1 67 cm, mass 578.464.2 kg, body fat 59.462.5%, VÇ O2peak 550.5 63.3 mL´kg21´min21) completed the 2 trials in this study. The test- ing protocol and informed consent information were approvedby the University of Connecticut Institutional Review Boardfor Studies Involving Human Subjects.All subjects attendeda brie®ng meeting before experimentation to ensure an under-standing of the testing protocol and the bene®ts and risks ofthe study and signed the informed consent statement.All sub-jects also completed a medical and exercise history question-naire.
Screening information was obtained to ensure that sub- jects met the following criteria: (1) no chronic healthproblems, (2) no previous history of heat illness, (3)no historyof cardiovascular, metabolic, or respiratory disease, (4) no his-tory of CrM use in the past year, and (5) no history of lowerleg conditions involving the neurologic or vascular structures.Subjects were paid for their participation in this study. Experimental Design We used a double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo- controlled study design.The study consisted of 2 identicalsessions with the exception of the treatment.A random selec-tion of 6 subjects began with trial A, whereas5 subjectsstartedwith trial B.The 2 trials were (A) 21.6 g of placebo (P) (18capsules) per day for 7 days, and (B) 21.6 g of CrM (18 cap-sules/day; Mega Creatine Fuel; Twinlab Laboratories, Inc,Ronkonkoma, NY) per day for 7 days.
On the morning of day7 of each experimental trial, the subjects reported to the Hu-man Performance Laboratory to undergo a 2-part exercisepro-tocol in the heat: (1) a submaximal aerobic exercise regimen(DHY) designed to result in an approximate 2% decline inbody mass, and (2) an intense anaerobic exercise protocol(heat tolerance test [HTT]) designed to result in an approxi-mate additional 2% decline in body weight. Predehydration On day 7, the subject reported in a well-hydrated state and not having eaten for 12 hours.Hydration status was veri®edvia urine speci®c gravity.The lower leg was then preparedand anesthetized, and the indwelling catheter was placed inthe anterior compartment of the lower leg.Next, the subjectreceived a standard breakfast of a plain bagel with creamcheese, a banana, apple juice, and the treatment dose.Afterbreakfast, each subject positioned a rectal thermistor andstoodin the environmental chamber (temperature 533.5 60.68C, humidity 541612%) for 30 minutes.
Heat and humidity in the environmental chamber were set at levels commonly ex-perienced by athletes, especially during early-season 2- or 3-a-day exercise sessions in August throughout the United Statesin preparation for high school and collegiate sport seasons. 22 During the 30 minutes of equilibration, pre-DHY measure-ments were recorded, including ACP, body mass, blood pres-sure, and perceptual measures.The body mass recorded at thattime was the starting point for the DHY procedure.The ACPmeasures were taken to provide a resting pre-DHY measure-ment.Dehydration After the equilibration period, the subject began the DHY procedure.This involved alternating 30 minutes of walking(pace 56.660.32 kph, intensity 537.1 66.1% VÇ O2max) on a treadmill with 30 minutes of stationary cycling (at a sim-ilar relative intensity) in the heat (temperature 533.560.58C, humidity 541612%) for a total of 120 minutes, resulting in 1.9 60.5% DHY.
A 120-minute exercise session to elicit approximately a 2% reduction in body weight was chosen be-cause this is a common level of dehydration that an athletewould have beginning an exercise session, especially duringmultiple exercise sessions on the same day or on successivedays of intense exercise in the heat. 22 32Volume 41 xNumber 1 xMarch 2006After the 120 minutes of exercise, the subject sat quietly in the chamber for 60 minutes and consumed a snack of 1 Ga-torade Sports Bar (Chicago, IL) and 200 mL of water alongwith the treatment (CrM or P) dose.After ingesting the snack,the subject stood in the environmental chamber for 30 minutesand pre-HTT measurements were recorded, including ACP,body mass, blood pressure, and perceptual measures.TheACPmeasures were taken to provide a DHY measurement (post-DHY).Heat Tolerance Test After the DHY, snack, and equilibration, the subject then performed an 80-minute run on a treadmill.
Speci®cally, theHTT included 12 repetitions, alternatinga3-minutewalk(pace54.060.1 miles´h 21, intensity 537.1 66.1% VÇO2max) with a high-intensity, 1-minute sprint (pace 56.660.32 kph, intensity 5115.0 65.6% VÇO2max), resulting in an additional 2% decline in body weight. We chose an 80-minute HTT be-cause this is a typical length of a practice session or game innumerous sports.The exercise was terminated if the subjectstopped because of volitional exhaustion, had a rectal temper-ature greater than or equal to 40.0 8C, had a heart rate $185 beats´min 21for 5 consecutive minutes, exhibited signs of heat intolerance, or could not maintain a normal running cadence.
After the HTT, ACP measures were recorded at 1 (1 post- HTT), 3 (3 post-HTT), 5 (5 post-HTT), 10 (10 post-HTT), 15(15 post-HTT), and 60 (60 post-HTT) minutes postexercise.After the 5-minute postexercise ACP measurement, thesubjectstood for the remaining 55 minutes in the thermoneutral en-vironment and rehydrated with 1 L of water within 10 minutesafter leaving the chamber. Body weight and many psycholog-ical factors, including thermal sensation, the EnvironmentalSymptoms Questionnaire, and a medical signs and symptomschecklist were also examined before, during, and after theHTT.After standing for 60 minutes, the subject was then al-lowed to sit or lie down, and the indwelling catheter was re-moved.The subject was then given an additiona l1Lo fwater and another Gatorade Sports Bar and was monitored for 30 to60 minutes.
Creatine Monohydrate Supplementation We chose a 21.6 g/d dosage of CrM because athletes typi- cally use about 20 to 25 g/d for 7 to 10 days during theloadingphase of CrM supplementation. 2±4,19On days 1±7, subjects consumed 7.2 g of either P or CrM in identical tablet form atbreakfast, lunch, and dinner.After the HTT, they began awashout period.The mean washout period was 54 610 days.Subjects were instructed to not consume any alcohol or drugsfor the 7 days of each experimental iteration.We also instruct-ed subjects to maintain their normal ®tness training regimensthroughout the study and during the washout period.Eachsub-ject then began the second experimental trial, which was anexact duplicate of the ®rst except that the subject received thetreatment opposite to that received in the ®rst experimentaltrial.
Anterior Compartment Pressure Measurement Anterior compartment pressure was measured using a Stry- ker Intracompartmental Pressure Monitor System (Stryker In-struments, Kalamazoo, MI). Before catheter insertion, we cal-ibrated the Stryker System according to the guidelines provided by the manufacturer.The lower leg was ®rst prepared by shaving from the knee to the middle of the lower leg, and the insertion site 6 cmdistal to the inferior aspect of the tibial tuberosity and 3.5 cmlateral to the anterior tibial spine was marked.While the sub-ject was lying supine with the great toe pointed vertically, theskin over the tibialis anterior muscle was cleaned with alcoholand anesthetized with 5 mL of 2% lidocaine without epineph-rine.The insertion area was then sterilized and cleaned witha Betadine solution (Purdue Frederick Co, Norwalk, CT).
Anindwelling catheter was next inserted by piercing the skin andfascia at an angle of approximately 45 8with a breakaway nee- dle, which was advanced 2 to 3 cm into the tibialis anteriormuscle belly. After the catheter was in place, the needle wasremoved, and the catheter was capped with a stopcock deviceto ensure a closed system and taped into place to allow thesubject to exercise.Excessive tape was removed before mea-surements were taken to prevent arti®cial increases intheACP.At several points in the trial, the catheter was ¯ushed with aheparin solution to prevent a blood clot from forming in thecatheter.For a measurement, the subject was placed in a standing position with all his weight on the contralateral leg and but-tocks leaning against the rail of the treadmill.The subject'sleg was placed on a chair in front of him with his knee ex-tended fully and his ankle dorsi¯exed to 80 8.
When the ante- rior tibialis muscle was felt to be relaxed on palpation to avoidexcessive pressure, the cap was removed from the stopcock,and the Stryker System was connected to the catheter. Thesystem was ¯ushed with less than 3 mL of the heparin andsaline solution, and when the pressure equalized, the digitalmeasurement was recorded.Statistical Analysis Data were reported as mean 6SD.Analyses of variance with repeated measures were used to compare differenceswithin the 2 trials and the time points and any interactionbetween time and trial.For the ACP measures, the within-subjects factors were trial with 2 levels (CrM, P) and timewith 8 levels (pre-DHY, post-DHY, 1 post-HTT, 3 post-HTT,5 post-HTT, 10 post-HTT, 15 post-HTT, 60 post-HTT).For thebody mass and resting blood pressure measures, the within-subjects factors were trial with 2 levels (CrM, P) and timewith 2 levels (day 1, day 7).
We calculated paired-sample t tests using a Bonferroni correction to follow up signi®canttrialeffects, time effects, and interactions. Signi®cance was set atthe .05 level of con®dence.All statistics were run using SPSS(version 10.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).RESULTSBody Mass and Blood Pressure Measurements We noted a signi®cant interaction for body mass ( D5 0.614, F 1,1056.277,P5.031, partial h250.386) (Table 1).The mean body mass for the CrM group increased about1 kg (by 0.88 61.08 kg), whereas the P group's body mass decreased slightly (by 0.17 60.83 kg) from day 1 to day 7.We failed to ®nd interaction effects or timeortrialmaineffectsin resting blood pressure measurements between the trials forresting systolic or diastolic blood pressure ( P..05).Journal of Athletic Training 33Table 1.

We conducted 7 paired- samplesttests to follow up on the signi®cant interaction.
Dif- ferences in ACP measurements between the pre-DHY timepoint and each of the 6 following time points were not sig-ni®cantly different between the trials after adjustments weremade. However, the data demonstrated a moderate effect sizebetween the trials for the differences between pre-DHY andpost-DHY (Table 2) and pre-DHY and 1 post-HTT (Table 2).A small effect size was demonstrated between the trials forpre-DHY when paired with 3 post-HTT (Table 2), 15 post-HTT (Table 2), and 60 DHY (Figure).Adverse Physical Effects Of the 11 subjects, 10 completed the entire 80-minute HTT exercise protocol at the speci®ed relative intensities based onoxygen consumption collected during preexperimental testing.One subject's test was terminated at minute 60 of the HTTprotocol because of a rectal temperature greater than 40.0 8C.No adverse physical effects were reported for any subjects ineither trial for the supplementation protocol or exercise in theheat.
Speci®cally, no subject complained of symptoms resem-bling anterior compartment syndrome. This included no re-ports of lower extremity aching, cramping, burning pain, ortightness in the lower leg or anterior compartment, which wasdetermined by review of a questionnaire and a medical signsand symptoms checklist that subjects completed before andafter the DHY and HTT.DISCUSSION Our results show that short-term CrM loading did not sig- ni®cantly increase resting ACP measures.However, CrM didaffect the ACP responses speci®c to dehydration, because asmall to moderate effect was reported between pre-DHY andpost-DHY ACP measures.Our data showed a greater increasein ACP in the CrM trial than in the P trial at the post-DHY time point.It is important to note that the subjects exercisedfor 2 hours, divided between bicycling and walking, toachieveDHY; however, measures were taken 50 minutes after the ac-tivity.
We also found that CrM had an effect on the dehydratedsubjects exercising in the heat, because a small to moderateinteraction was reported between pre-DHY and 1 post-HTTexercise for the trials. In addition, we discovered that CrMsupplementation caused a delay in the return of postexerciseACP measures to resting values in these dehydrated subjectsexercising in the heat.As expected, our results are consistent with the ®ndings of previous authors who have noted body mass increases in the®rst days of CrM supplementation, likely from a decrease in¯uid excretion and an increase in ¯uid retention.2±9,11±13,18Be- cause of the unyielding dimensions of the anterior compart-ment, any increase in ¯uid retention from CrM supplementa-tion that leads to a direct swelling of the muscle ®bers in thecompartment might overwhelm the limited space available fornormal increases in ACP with exercise.
This potential mech-anism of increased ¯uid that shifts to within the interstitial 34Volume 41 xNumber 1 xMarch 2006space of the anterior compartment could supportthesigni®cant increase in ACP. Our ®ndings are somewhat consistent with the 2 recently published studies investigating CrM supplementation andACP, 16,17although we observed increases in ACP with exer- cise and a delay in pressure recovery but not increases in rest-ing values.Schroeder et al 16and Potteiger et al17established a signi®cant pattern of increased resting and postexerciseACPand a delay in recovery from the increased pressure in indi-viduals supplementing with creatine.In conjunction with thesigni®cantly increased ACP measurements, both Schroeder etal 16and Potteiger et al17noted multiplesubjectssufferingfrom symptoms consistent with anterior compartment syndrome.Subjective complaints of tightness, aching, cramping, or burn-ing pain over the anterior compartment were reported in the 2studies.
16,17Other than a case report also published by Pot- teiger et al,15no other published study includes symptoms of increased ACP.4,11,13No evidence was observed in our study that short-term CrM loading led to the signs and symptomsconsistent with anterior compartment syndrome in a dehy-drated athlete performing intense, intermittent, and prolongedexercise in the heat and humidity. None of the subjects in thisstudy complained of lower extremity aching, cramping, burn-ing pain, or tightness over the area of the anteriorcompartmentof the lower leg, which is consistent with most of the litera-ture.2±7,11,13 However, multiple differences exist between our study and the previous 2 investigations concerned with CrM supplemen-tation and ACP measures.16,17First, the principal difference critical to this investigation was the dual stresses of dehydra-tion and performing the exercise protocol in the heat.
Onepossible explanation could be that during the dehydrated state,the pool of increased ¯uid retention resulting from initial CrM supplementation is indeed usable by the body and shifts fromwithin the osteofacial space rather than becoming trapped inthe compartment. The pressure may not have increased as dra-matically in these dehydrated subjects supplementing withCrM and exercising in the heat because ¯uid was needed bythe body and the water was pulled from the osteofacial spacerather than being retained in the closed space.This mechanismmay be additionally supported by the ®nding of increasedACPin the CrM trial and decreased pressures with the P after re-hydration of 1 L of water.It is important to consider that thenegative effects of dehydration are far more detrimental thanany bene®t resulting from a diminished ACP.A second difference between this and previous studies in- volves the posture of the subjects.
16,17,23In our study, subjects were positioned standing upright with weight on the contra-lateral leg rather than the traditional supine positioning. How-ever, because of the crossover design, comparisons can still bemade among trials and subjects.Finally, exercise protocols inprevious investigations were quite different in intensity andduration, whereas we used traditional clinical protocols for as-sessing ACP measurements.16,17,23Speci®cally, previous au- thors16,17used treadmill running with no grade at 80% of max- imal aerobic power for 20 minutes.This exercise protocol wasdeveloped and used by clinicians because symptoms of ante-rior compartment syndrome could be generally reproduced bysymptomatic individuals within the boundaries of the proto-col.23However, we employed a unique protocol combining aerobic and anaerobic exercise to mimic sport participation ina practice or competition.
Although accurate comparisonswithprior studies may be dif®cult, our results indicate that the in-termittent and prolonged nature of our exercise protocol did not raise ACP as dramatically as did thecontinuous,20-minuteexercise protocol of the traditional testing procedure. Thismaybe a result of the inability of the pressure to accumulate be-cause of the recovery period during the exercise.A high dose of CrM supplementation during exercise pe- riods of increased thermal stress showed a mild to moderatetrend toward increased ACP measures in dehydrated males.However, our results do not support the American College ofSports Medicine's recommendation, because no associatedsymptoms of anterior compartment syndrome were seen.Thedifferences were minimal, and the increased pressures readilyequalized after intermittent exercise.Future researchersshouldinclude a similar dehydration protocol, followed by a longer,continuous bout of exercise.
In addition, it would be bene®cialto determine whether individuals who suffer from anteriorcompartment syndrome have increased symptoms during CrMsupplementation. Finally, it is important that medical person-nel, including certi®ed athletic trainers and team physicians,consider risk factors associated with increasing ACP whentreating athletes supplementing with CrM.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by the National Athletic Trainers' As- sociation Research & Education Foundation (Dallas, TX) and StrykerInstruments (Kalamazoo, MI).We thank the 11 dedicated subjects fortheir commitment to the study.Also, we gratefully acknowledge thetechnical assistance provided by Dr Jeff Volek, Michael D'Alfonso,Katie Krog, and Alex Seen.REFERENCES 1.Harris RC, Soderlund K, Hultman E.Elevation of creatine in resting and exercised muscle of normal subjects by creatine supplementation.Clin Sci (Lond).1992;83:367±374.2.Kraemer WJ, Volek JS.
