Objectives: This retrospective study evaluated the effects of insulin aspart injection plus high-dose vitamin D (HD-VD) supplementation on treatment outcomes and mater - nal - infant outcomes in patients with GDM. Methods: A total of 129 GDM patients admitted to the Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University from December 2021 to December 2023 were included in this study.According to the intervention regimen, the patients were divided into two groups: a control group of 59 patients receiving insulin aspart injection plus low-dose vitamin D (LD-VD) supplementation and a research group of 70 cases receiving insulin aspart injection plus HD-VD supplementation.
The curative effect, blood glucose metabolism (fasting blood glucose [FPG], 2-hour postprandial blood glucose [2hPG], and glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c]), homocysteine (HCY), and cystatin C (Cys C), maternal and infant outcomes (maternal outcomes: hypoglycemia, cesarean sec - tion, polyhydramnios, and premature rupture of membranes; neonatal outcomes: stillbirth, macrosomia, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and Apgar score) were recorded and compared between the two groups. Risk factors affecting maternal and infant outcomes were analyzed.Results: The research group demonstrated a higher overall effective rate in compared to the control group (P<0.05).Post-treatment measurements of FPG, 2hPG, HbA1c, HCY, and Cys C in the research group were statistically lower than the pre-treatment levels and those in the control group (all P<0.05).
Additionally, the research group showed better maternal and neonatal outcomes, with fewer ad - verse pregnancy-related conditions and better neonatal health indicators, including higher Apgar scores (P<0.05). Besides, insulin aspart injection plus high-dose vitamin D was a protective factor for maternal and infant outcomes (P<0.05).Conclusions: Insulin aspart injection plus HD-VD supplementation markedly enhances treatment efficacy and improves maternal and infant outcomes in GDM.Keywords: Insulin aspart injection, high-dose vitamin D supplementation, gestational diabetes mellitus, therapeu - tic effect, maternal and infant outcomes Introduction Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a preva - lent metabolic disorder during pregnancy, often triggered by vitamin D deficiency, increased fat consumption, excessive weight gain during pregnancy, and psychological stress including negative emotions [1].
According to statistics, the incidence of GDM in Asia was as high as 21.0% in 2017, with a 30-69% likelihood of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies [2-4]. GDM is mainly manifested by varying degrees of glucose intolerance during pregnancy, which can further lead to a decrease in insulin sensi - tivity in peripheral tissues and compensatory hyperinsulinemia [5].This condition is associ - ated with a range of adverse pregnancy out - comes, such as premature birth, cesarean sec - tion (CS), and premature rupture of membranes (PROM), as well as unfavorable neonatal out - comes such as stillbirth, macrosomia, and neo - natal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) [6, 7].Beyond immediate concerns, GDM can also bring long-term harm to maternal and infant outcomes like cardio-metabolic diseases [8].Therefore, effective prevention and treatment Gestational diabetes mellitus 4201 Am J Transl Res 2024;16(8):4200-4207of GDM are essential to mitigate its short- and long-term health impact.
Insulin aspart is a commonly used treatment for GDM, with a rapid onset, quick absorption, and rapid peak plasma concentrations, mirror - ing the activity of natural insulin [9, 10]. In the research of Mu et al.[11], insulin aspart plus exercise-diet therapy not only helped GDM patients stabilize their blood sugar levels effec - tively, but also reduced the risk of adverse pregnancies.According to Wang et al.[12], insulin aspart can be combined with metformin to help GDM patients with chronic hypertension to effectively control blood sugar and blood pressure, contributing to a reduction in unfa - vorable perinatal and neonatal outcomes.On the other hand, vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of developing GDM [13].Early intervention with vitamin D supple - ments has proven effective in slowing the pro - gression of GDM in deficient pregnant women [14].As indicated by Hosseinzadeh-Shamsi- Anar et al.
[15], high-dose vitamin D (HD-VD) support for pregnant women with GDM helped to improve the condition of GDM rapidly, while maintaining safety. Currently, research on the influence of insulin aspart injection plus HD-VD supplementation on GDM patients and maternal - infant out - comes is still limited.This study aims to fill that gap, offering insight into more effective treat - ment and enhanced outcomes for mothers with GDM and their babies.Materials and methods Patient information This retrospective study selected 129 GDM mothers admitted in the Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University between December 2021 and December 2023.Among them, the control group (n=59) received insulin aspart plus low- dose vitamin D (LD-VD) treatment, and the research group (n=70) received insulin aspart plus HD-VD therapy.This research was con - ducted under the approval of the Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University’s Ethics Committee.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria: Patients with singleton preg - nancies and diagnosed with GDM (the criteria for GDM: oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 25-29 weeks of pregnancy showing one or more of the following: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) >5.1 mmol/L, 1-hour postprandial blood glucose (1hPG) >10.0 mmol/L, and 2hPG >8.5 mmol/L [16]); Patients with serum 25(OH)D3 levels below 35 ng/ml; Patients with fasting blood glucose (FBG) over 13.9 mmol/L and the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) over 11%; Preference for intensive insulin treatment. Exclusion criteria: History or family history of diabetes; Use of vitamin D and calcium in the past six months; History of medication that affected insulin secretion and sensitivity; Severe diseases of the heart, lungs, kidneys, or endocrine system; Mental illness or cognitive dysfunction.Medication method Insulin aspart plus LD-VD therapy was applied in the control group.
Patients received subcuta - neous injections of insulin aspart (ShenZhen ChemStrong Scientific Co., Ltd., EPY0000349). The dosage was adjusted according to the patient’s glycemic index.In addition, the patients were given 400 units of vitamin D3 (Beijing Yita Biotechnology Co., Ltd., YT63592) orally once daily.The research group received insulin aspart plus HD-VD.All patients received subcutane - ous injections of insulin aspart (ShenZhen ChemStrong Scientific Co., Ltd., EPY0000349), with the injection dose appropriately adjusted according to the patient’s blood sugar.The total daily dosage was calculated based on body weight, ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 U/kg.This included two-thirds as dietary insulin to man - age postprandial glucose levels and one-third as basal insulin to maintain baseline insulin lev - els.Patients were given 800 units of vitamin D3 (Beijing Yita Biotechnology Co., Ltd., YT63592) orally once daily.Both groups were treated for 12 weeks.
Outcome measures (1) Efficacy [17]. Efficacy evaluation criteria: Cure is defined as the disappearance of all clini - cal symptoms with FPG, 2hPG, and HbA1c returning to the normal range; Markedly effec - tive is defined as near-complete resolution of symptoms, as with reductions in FPG and 2hPG Gestational diabetes mellitus 4202 Am J Transl Res 2024;16(8):4200-4207by more than 40% and HbA1c by more than 30%, although values may not be within the normal range; Effective corresponds to im- provement in clinical symptoms and a 20%- 40% reduction in FPG and 2hPG along with a 10%-30% decrease in HbA1c; Ineffective is defined as failure to meet the above criteria.The total effective rate = (cure cases + mark - edly effective cases + effective cases)/total cases * 100%.(2) Blood glucose metabolism [18].2 mL of fasting venous blood was collect - ed before and after treatment.
After centrifuga - tion, the supernatant was analyzed using an automatic glycation analyzer for FPG and 2hPG, and high-performance liquid chromatography for HbA1c. (3) Homocysteine (HCY) and cystatin C (Cys C) [19].HCY and Cys C levels in the supernatant samples collected before and after treatment were detected by immunoturbi - dimetry.(4) Maternal and infant outcomes [20].Maternal outcomes: The perinatal complica - tions such as hypoglycemia, cesarean section (CS), polyhydramnios, and premature rupture of membranes (PROM) were observed and recorded.Neonatal outcome: The number of adverse reactions such as stillbirth, macroso - mia, and neonatal respiratory distress syn - drome (NRDS) were observed and recorded.Meanwhile, neonatal Apgar scores were com - paratively evaluated.Statistical processing SPSS21.0 was used for statistical analyses of the collected experimental data.
The measured data were represented as _x±s; an independent sample t-test was used for between-group com - parison while a paired t-tests was used for with - in-group comparison. The counted data were expressed as the rate [%], and χ2 test was used to determine inter-group differences.Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors affecting adverse maternal and infant outcome.Differences were significant when P<0.05.Results General information No notable inter-group differences were ob- served in age, gestational weeks, body mass index, primipara, or family history between the two groups (all P>0.05), as shown in Table 1 .Comparison of curative effects between the two groups The research group had an overall effective rate of 92.86%, which was significantly higher than the 81.36% in the control group (P<0.05), as shown in Table 2 .Table 1.

Comparison of maternal and infant outcomes Maternal outcomes, including hypoglycemia, CS, polyhy - dramnios, and PROM were assessed.The research group had significantly lower rates of hypoglycemia, CS, and PROM compared with the control group (all P<0.05), but with Gestational diabetes mellitus 4204 Am J Transl Res 2024;16(8):4200-4207history were not risk factors for maternal and infant outcomes (all P>0.05); however, insulin aspart injection plus HD-VD supplementation was a protective factor (P=0.001; Tables 5 , 6).Discussion Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a preva - lent complication during pregnancy, influenced by decreased insulin sensitivity caused by abnormal hormones such as estrogen, proges - terone, and placental prolactin [21].
As preg - nancy progresses, these hormonal changes complicate the maintenance of blood sugar balance, often leading to abnormal blood sugar elevation that trigger GDM. Common symptoms include polyphagia, polydipsia, and polyuria, which can lead to unfavorable outcomes like macrosomia, NRDS, fetal malformations, and neonatal jaundice [22].Therefore, taking effec - tive prevention and treatment measures for GDM is of great significance for improving neo - natal and pregnancy outcomes.This study identified an obviously higher overall efficacy in the research group compared to the control group (92.86% vs.81.36%), indicating substantial benefits of combining insulin aspart with high-dose vitamin D (HD-VD) for treating GDM patients.A systematic review and meta- analysis indicated a significant inverse associa - tion between vitamin D and the risk of develop -Table 3.

A guinea pig experiment showed that dietary intake of vita - min D during pregnancy could improve the body’s glucose tolerance to some extent, although it did not reduce the risk of GDM [26]. In our study, post-treatment measurements showed significant reductions in FPG, 2hPG, and HbA1c in the research group, significantly lower than the pre-treatment levels and the control group, indicating that insulin aspart injection and HD-VD can effectively restore nor - mal glucose metabolism in GDM patients.Similarly, evidence has also shown that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy can effec - tively alleviate maternal insulin resistance and improve fetal growth [27].Both HCY and Cys C are associated with adverse maternal outcome.HCY is significantly associated with GDM in pregnant mothers, while Cys C correlates with adverse birth out - comes (macrosomia and large-for-gestational- age infants) in the third trimester, making them potential targets for GDM treatment [28-30].
Therefore, we assessed the changes in HCY and Cys C levels in this study. Post-treatment assessment showed that HCY and Cys C levels were significantly decreased as compared to the pre-treatment levels and those of the con - trol group.This suggests that insulin aspart plus HD-VD can significantly inhibit HCY and Cys C in GDM patients, thereby potentially slow - ing disease progression.In the research by Wang Y et al.[31], insulin aspart plus metfor - min contributed to effective control of FPG, 2hPG, HbA1c, and other blood glucose metabo - lism-related indexes, as well as significant inhi - bition of Hcy, which is similar to our observa - tions.As reported by Al-Bayyari et al.[32], HD-VD used in overweight female patients not only reduced HCY levels, but also improved liver function and helped prevent cardiovascular and liver diseases.
Furthermore, our evaluation of maternal and infant outcomes revealed lower incidence rates of hypoglycemia, CS, and PROM in the research group compared to the control group. In addi - tion, the research group also reported statisti - cally fewer cases of macrosomia and NRDS and higher neonatal Apgar scores than the con - trol group, with a similar incidence of stillbirth.Supporting these findings, report by Wu et al.[33] demonstrated that vitamin D supplemen - tation effectively regulated blood lipid metabo - lism in GDM patients and reduced adverse neo - natal outcomes.In a meta-analysis [34], vita - min D supplementation in GDM pregnancies was associated with reduced adverse out - comes such as CS and postpartum hemor - rhage, with a preventive effect on adverse com - plications such as neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, macrosomia, fetal distress, and preterm birth.
In addition, insulin aspart injection plus HD-VD supplementation was indicated as a protective factor for maternal and infant outcomes by logistic regression analysis, further demon - strating that this combination therapy may help improve maternal and infant outcomes in GDM patients. According to the logistic analysis by Cheng et al.[35], HD-VD supplementation sig - nificantly reduced the risk of GDM.In a logistic regression analysis by Wen et al.[36], low vita - min D level not only increased the risk of GDM, but also increased the risk of adverse pregnan - cy outcomes such as anemia, macrosomia, abnormal amniotic fluid, miscarriage, or still - birth, which is similar to our study.
The innovation of this study lies in the compre - hensive evaluation and confirmation of the clin - ical benefits of insulin aspart injection plus HD-VD supplementation in GDM patients from the perspective of efficacy, blood glucose metabolism, HCY, Cys C, as well as its effective - ness in controlling blood sugar and disease progression. In addition, it was confirmed that insulin aspart injection plus HD-VD supplemen - tation has a positive impact on the improve - ment of maternal and infant outcomes in GDM patients.Moreover, this combined regimen was validated by logistic regression analysis to be a protective factor for improving maternal and infant outcomes in GDM patients.
Taken together, insulin aspart injection plus HD-VD supplementation is effective for treating GDM patients and helps stabilize patients’ blood glucose metabolism and HCY and Cys C levels, which can effectively improve maternal Gestational diabetes mellitus 4206 Am J Transl Res 2024;16(8):4200-4207and infant outcomes, prevent hypoglycemia, CS, PROM, macrosomia, and NRDS.
