1.Introduction Mastitis is the infammation of the mammary glands, which occur primarily due to intramammary bacterial infection [1].Bovine mastitis remains the largest hazard in the global dairyindustry since it causes major economic loss due to the re- duction in milk yield. Most cases of subclinical mastitis are causedbycontagiousmastitisbacteriasuchas Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus) andStreptococcus agalactiae (Str.aga- lactiae), whereas other environmental pathogens like Str.uberisandEscherichia coli (E.coli) are also considered to cause chronic mastitis [2].Local antibiotic treatments of themammary glands are the most common treatment methodfor mastitis [3].However, sometimes antibiotics show poorresponses and these difer for diferent pathogens causingmastitis [4].Each usage of antibiotics causes the risk to de-velop antibiotic resistance in pathogenic and commensalbacteria.Terefore,alternativestoantibioticcompoundshave to be investigated.
A biodegradable magnesium silver alloy (MgAg1%)couldbeapromisingtooltotreatbovinemastitis.Magnesium(Mg 2+)isanattractivematerialforbiodegradableimplants because of its low thrombogenicity, well-knownbiocompatibility, and lightweight [5]. Te in vivocorrosion of Mg 2+-based implants involves the formation of soluble nontoxic oxide which is excreted via the urine [6].Silver(Ag +)isabroad-spectrumantibioticwithantisepticandanti- infammatory properties that are not yet associated withbacterialresistance[7].Also,itsabilitytoimmediatelydestroymicroorganisms by disturbing the bacterial cell membranefunction and stopping cellular respiration recognizes it as animportant element [8].It is considered efective at lowconcentrations in addition to its therapeutic activity [9].Tis study aimed to investigate the ability of MgAg1% alloy to inhibit bacterial growth during the dry-of period.We hy-pothesize that MgAg1% alloy is efective in controllingbacterial growth during the dry-of period.
2.Materials and Methods 2.1.PreparationofMagnesium-Silver1%(MgAg1%)StickandSilver Nitrate. Te MgAg1% alloy was made from 99% magnesium and 1% silverwith a weight of10–70mg, lengthHindawi Veterinary Medicine International Volume 2023, Article ID 8627515, 7 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/8627515 of 1cm, and a diameter of 0.2cm (Institute of Materials Science, Leibniz University, Hannover, Germany) (Fig-ure 1).Tese dimensions mentioned are for the originalsamples as received, and alloys which were used of sampleswithdiferentdimensionsandconsequentlydiferentweight(10 to 70mg) were cut from the original samples to be used in the diferent tests.Silver nitrate was purchased from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany.Te MgAg1% sticks wereincubated in 5ml NaCl solution in a water bath for 15daysand the supernatant was used.2.2.Determination of the Silver Concentrations in the Deg- radationMedium.
Te amount of silver in the degradation medium of MgAg1% was measured using the kitNANOCOLORSilver3testusingaphotometricproceduredetermination. Ag +could be measured between 0.20 and 3.00mg/lAg+,assilverions,reactwithanindicatortoform a blue dye.In brief, for the determination of Ag+con- centrations in the degradation medium, the following wasdone: A stock solution of 1mmol/l AgNO 3was prepared, and acalibrationstandardcurveof0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,and 0.8mmol/l was prepared (Figure 2).Sterile MgAg 1%stickswereincubatedindiferentvolumesofthemedium(1,3, and 10ml) or NaCl without adding any other supple-ments,inadditiontoonetubeofthemediumasthenegativecontrol.Tey were incubated in a water bath at 37 °C with ashakingprocessfor25days.Tetestwasappliedaccordingto the manual manuscript with slight modifcations.28 µl NANOCOLORSilver3wasaddedperwellofa96-wellplate.10µl of the NANOCOLOR Silver 3 R2 was added.Ten, 80µlofthetestedsamplewasaddedandallthereagentswere shaken.
Afterward, 10 µl NANOCOLOR Silver 3 R3 was added per well, then it was mixed again and incubated for10min. Te samples were in duplicate numbers.Te mea-surements were performed on days 5, 10, 15, and 25 usinga photometer with a wavelength of 620nm.2.3.Determination of the Magnesium and Calcium Concen- trations in the Degradation Media.Te Mg 2+and Ca con- centrations in the degradation media were measured by thetest kit NANOCOLOR hardness 20 using a photometricprocedure.Tetestisbasedonmeasuringthetotalhardnessof the medium, which is primarily maintained by Mg 2+and Cabutisalsodeterminedbybariumandstrontiumions.Tecolor intensity depends on the total hardness of the sur-rounding medium.Te calcium content can be obtainedfrom the measured values of total hardness, and the Mg content can be calculated.A stock solution of MgCl2 was prepared (10mmol/l), andacalibrationsstandardcurveof0.1,0.25,0.5,0.75,1,2,3, 4, and 5mmol/l was prepared (Figure 3).
Te samples wereprepared from the degradation media by incubatingMgAg1% sticks in diferent volumes of 10, 3, and 1ml ofmedium or NaCl. One tube of pure medium or pure NaClserved as a negative control.Subsequently, 6 µl of tested sampleswere added in each well of a 96-well plate, and then180µl of NANOFIX hardness 20 R2 was added per sampleand6µlofhardness20R3solutionwasaddedpersample.It was mixed by pipetting up and down.Te samples were induplicate numbers.Te samples were measured at 570nm.Samples of higher concentrations above the calibration curve were diluted.Te measurements were performed ondays 5, 10, 15, and 25.2.4.Detection of Antibacterial Activity 2.4.1.DeterminationMgAg1%SticksonMICandMBCofthe Pathogenic Bacteria.Te broth dilution method (31) used Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, as indicator speciestoassesstheMICandMBCvaluesofMgAg1%sticks.
(a) Diferent mass amounts of MgAg1% stick concen- trations were incubated in 5mg/ml to 0.156mg/ml with adjusted bacterial concentration (10 8CFU/ml, 0.5McFarland’sstandard)for24hat37°C.TeMIC endpoint is the lowest concentration of MgAg1%, where no visible growth is seen in the tubes. (b) One ml of pathogenic organism inoculum (2×105CFU/ml) was applied to tubes containing MgAg1% sticks growth media in a serial two-folddilution.(c) Turbidity tubes were measured after 24hours as a growth indicator.Te minimum inhibitory con-centration (MIC) related to control is the lowestMgAg1% stick concentration that inhibits the or-ganism’s growth as detected by no visual turbidity.(d) MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) was described as the lowest concentration of test com-poundsthatpreventedvisiblebacterialgrowthonanLB agar plate after 24hours of incubation at 37 °C.
Te MBC was determined by testing the live mi-croorganisms in the MIC test tubes that showed nogrowth.Aloopofeachofthosetubeswasinoculated on LB agar, and growth signs were observed. Te presence of bacteria in the frst tube is indicated bybacterial growth.2.4.2.Bouillon Dilution and Cultivation of Bacteria in PetriDishes.Bouillon dilution testandcultivation ofbacteriain Petri dishes were done by the Milchtierherden-Betreuungs-und Forschungsgesellschaft mbH, Bad Nenn-dorf, Germany (MBFG).Te tests aim to determine theefect of Mg-Ag-NaCl solution on the growthof E.coliand S.aureus.In brief, MgAg1% sticks were incubated in 5mlNaCl solution in a water bath for 15days, and the degrading supernatants (MgAg1% sticks incubated in NaCl) were used for the bouillon dilution test and thecultivation of bacteria (E.coli and S.aureus).Firstly, thebouillon dilution test was done by preparing a bacterialsuspension by incubating about 2 E.coliandS.
aureus colonies (GK)in 100ml bufered peptone waterat 37 °Cfor 24hours on the shaker. Te bacterial dilution series was770×10 5, 910 ×105, 100 ×106, and 210 ×106KbE/ml.Ten, 2 test tubes were flled with 5ml of bacterial suspension,thendegradingwasaddedtooneofthetubes,andtheother2 VeterinaryMedicineInternational one serves as a negative control.Later, the number of bacterial colonies was determined.Secondly, E.coliand S.aureus colonies were cultivated in Petri dishes.After- ward, the bacterial colonies were incubated with thedegrading supernatants, and the number of bacterial col-onies was determined.2.4.3.Brilliant Black Reduction Test.Te BRT was frst described by KRAACK and TOLLE (1967) (15).Tis test isused for detecting antimicrobial agents in milk.Te testmedium consists of a mixture of nutrients, brilliant blackindicator, bacteria B.stearothermophilus var.calidolactis C953, and other supplements.

Penicillin Gserved as a positive control and milk as a negative control.MgAg1%sticks were incubated with 1, 3, and 10ml of Dulbecco’sMEMmedium(DMEM),andtheconcentrationofMg 2+and Ag+was noted in each volume.In addition, diferent con- centrations of AgNO 3solution (control, 0.0001, 0.0003, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1mmol/l) were in-cubated with DMEM medium in test tubes.All tubes wereincubated in a water bath for 5days, then 100 µl of each sample was added per well and incubated for 5-6hours at65 °C.2.5.Statistical Analysis.Data are presented as mean- ±standard deviation (SD).Statistical analysis was carried out by two-way analysis of variance.Calculations wereperformedwithGraphPadPrism ®5.03.Pvalues<0.05were considered statistically signifcant.
3.Results 3.1.TeConcentrationofMagnesiumandSilver. Teamount of magnesium and silver in MgAg1% degradation mediawithNaClwasabout0.8mmol/land0.3mmol/lafter15days of incubation, respectively (Figure 4).3.2.Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC).Te MIC and MBC confrmed the qualitative antibacterialefcacy of the MgAg1% sticks, and the results are presentedinTable1.Teminimuminhibitoryconcentration(MIC)ofMgAg1% sticks was quantitatively investigated using theturbidity method.Results showed that a normal microbialgrowth inhibition zone was present.Te antibacterial efectof various concentrations of MgAg1% relative to the testedpathogenic bacteria was highly signifcant.MIC and MBC ranged between 0.2 and 0.35mL.Results show that the inhibition ratio of microbial strains increased to the max-imumlevelof620nmaddedbeforereachingthelimit,whereMgAg1% inhibited growth.S.

4.Discussion In the present study, MgAg1% alloys are used for killingthe pathogens responsible for causing mastitis. A com-bination of magnesium and silver was chosen due to itsdistinctpropertiesandnegligiblesideefects.Mg 2+serves as a biodegradable material, and Ag+has a good anti- microbial efect.Depending on the concentration of Ag+ used,itcanactasabacteriostaticorbactericidal[10].Teuse of antimicrobial therapy afects the human con- sumption of dairy products due to the presence of an- tibiotic residues in milk, it also increases labor andveterinary costs.As stated by Tilton, the soluble form ofsilver is most toxic to bacteria, therefore silver sticks aredegraded in the solution of NaCl and used in the presentstudy 7.Some clinical scenarios among humans thatconsume infected dairy products have public healthimportance, such as streptococcal sore throat, foodpoisoning due to S.aureus, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and brucellosis [11].
Antibiotic infusions into the mammaryglands are the most common treatment method for mastitis [3, 12]. Resultsshowedthatthenumberofcoloniesof E.coliand S.aureus incubated with diferent volumes of MgAg1% in NaCl, decreased 5 times compared to the control.Te concentrationofsilverwhichinducedtheantibacterialefectwas 0.2–0.3mmol/L which was measured after 15days ofincubation.Another study by Starodub and Trevors alsoshowedthe same resultthat E.colistrainR1culturestreated with 0.3, 0.5, and 1mM of AgNO 3reduced the fnal cell biomass [9].Among the three concentrations used 0.5, and1mM showed a good antibacterial efect even after the incubation period was extended to 48hours.Te result of anotherstudyconductedbyKyunetal.showedadecreaseinthe bacterial count of S.aureus andE.colidue to silver ions [10].Te results obtained from the BRT test showed that B.
stearothermophilus shifted from brilliant black color to yellow or colorless at a concentration equal to or more than0.03mmol/, which indicates that concentrations of AgNO 3 solution starting from 1 up to 0.002mmol/l have an anti-bacterial efect. Moreover, diferent volumes of degradationmedium of MgAg1% shifted the blue color to yellow or colorless at volumes equal to or below 3ml.Te concen- trationofAg +inthesolutionswhichshowedanantibacterial efect was 0.02–1mmol/l.Jansen et al.and Schierholz et al.stated that the efect of Ag+is continuous and long-lasting due to the oligodynamic efect of elementary Ag+[8, 13].Moreover, Bowswald et al.
statedthattheabilityofmanybacteriatoproduceabioflmisreduced, and the likelihood of bacterial colonization is de-creased whenAg +isintroduced [14].Many studiesstatedthe antibacterial activity of nonsteroidal anti-infammatory4 VeterinaryMedicineInternational drugs, local anaesthetics, phenothiazine such as chlorprom- azine, levomepromazine, promethazine, trifuoperazine,methdilazine and thioridazine, antidepressants, antiplatelet,and statins [13]. Several studies have explored a possibleprotective efect of statins in decreasing the morbidity andmortality of many infectious diseases [15].Various non-antibiotic agents exhibit antimicrobial activity via multipleand diferent mechanisms of action [14, 16].
