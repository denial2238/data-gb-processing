Some infants develop hypoxaemia when breathing 15% oxygen Some infants may develop hypoxaemia in air with oxy- gen reduced to 15% —similar to that found in aircraft and at high altitude.T o investigate the effects of 15%oxygen on the control of breathing Parkins et al(p 887) exposed 34 infants to 15% oxygen.Blood oxy-gen saturation was maintained at slightly reducedvalues in most infants but in four infants values fellgreatly.This adverse response could not be predictedfrom measurements made in room air before exposureto 15% oxygen.These findings may explain why someinfants with reduced oxygen in their airways as a resultof respiratory infection develop sudden or persistentfalls in blood oxygen saturation.
Folic acid and vitamin B-12 and B-6 supplements reduce bloodhomocysteine concentrations Higher blood concentrations of homocysteine seem to be associated with higher risks of occlusive vasculardisease, and are inversely related to blood concentra-tions of folate and vitamins B-12 and B-6. The Homo-cysteine Lowering Trialists’ Collaboration (p 894)reviewed data for 1114 subjects in 12 randomised trialsof folic acid based supplements to assess the effects onblood homocysteine concentrations of different dosesof folic acid, with or without vitamins B-12 and B-6,and found that reductions in blood homocysteine withfolic acid supplementation were greater at higher pre-treatment concentrations of blood homocysteine andat lower pretreatment concentrations of blood folate.Vitamin B-12 produced additional reductions.
In typi-cal Western populations, daily supplementation withboth 0.5-5 mg folic acid and about 0.5 mg vitamin B-12would be expected to reduce blood homocysteineconcentrations by about a quarter to a third. Psychosocial problems continue in homeless families after rehousing The characteristics and health needs of homeless chil- dren and families have been little researched.On p 899Vostanis et al report on the psychosocial outcome ofhomeless families one year after rehousing.Familieshad experienced domestic violence, violence fromneighbours, abuse, and social and educational disrup-tion.Mental health problems in children and mothersremained significantly higher than in comparisonfamilies and the general population, and an appreci- able proportion of homeless families remainedresidentially and socially unstable.
“Collapse” after pertussis vaccination does not recur aftersubsequent doses T o determine whether sudden loss of muscle tone, pallor, and loss of responsiveness after the first dose ofa whole cell vaccine such as pertussis is followed byfurther episodes of “collapse” Vermeer-de Bondt et alfollowed up 105 Dutch children with an episode ofcollapse after their first vaccination to see whether sub-sequent collapse reactions occurred after later doses ofvaccine (p 902). None occurred in the 84 childrenknown to have had subsequent doses of pertussis vac-cine.The authors conclude that a collapse reaction isnot a contraindication to further doses of pertussisvaccine.Phantom limb pain is not a sign of grief Conflicting beliefs exist about the influence of emotional factors on the experience of phantom limbpain after amputation.Fisher and Hanspal assessedphantom pain and scores on the hospital anxiety anddepression scale in 93 attenders at a prostheticrehabilitation clinic (p 903).
Pain was reported by 29patients and non-painful sensations by another 53.Those with pain did not differ from the others in anxi-ety or depression scores or in time since amputation.They suggest that phantom pain is a sign neither ofgrief nor of emotional adjustment. Antibiotics are unlikely to alter clinical course of acute cough Patients who have acute cough, with or without sputum, often consult their general practitioner andmany request and receive antibiotics .On p 906 Faheyet al report a systematic review of randomised control-led trials comparing antibiotics with placebo.Theyfound that antibiotics were no better than placebo inreducing cough or altering clinical outcome.Further-more, antibiotics were associated with side effects.This week in the BMJ BMJ VOLUME 316 21 MARCH 1998
