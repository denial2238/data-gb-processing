The results showed that, when the welding heat input of 150 kJ/cm, 250 kJ/cm and 350 kJ/cm was utilized, the microstructure of heat affected zone in the experimental EH36 steel consisted of grain boundary ferrite, acicular ferrite, granular bainite, and a small amount of pearlite, but the volume fraction and grain size of each independent microstructure were different. With the increase of welding heat input, the content of acicular ferrite and granular bainite decreased, the content of grain boundary ferrite increased, and the average grain size increased, whereas the low temperature toughness of the experimental EH36 steel welded joint reduced from 174 to 67 J.Furthermore, MgAl 2O4 inclusions can induce acicular ferrite nucleation, whereas the nucleation mechanism is a combination of low lattice mismatch and low interfacial energy.
Because of the marine engineering’s important strategic position, the demand for ship plate steel is steadily increasing, at same time, there are rising expectations for enhanced property of this steel, which drives its development in the direction of achieving higher strength, higher toughness, and improved weldability1,2. The large heat input can be used to complete the welding of thick steel plates in a single pass, thus replacing the traditional multi-pass welding, which can significantly shorten the processing time, reduce energy consumption, and reduce the overall cost3,4.Therefore, the high-heat input welding technology has become a prevalent choice in the production of large equipment.However, the heat affected zone (HAZ) property of these steels decreases significantly under high heat input welding conditions, mainly because the HAZ cooling time increases due to the large heat input, which leads to the coarsening of austenite grains and a sharp decline in toughness.
According to theory of “oxide metallurgy” , fine inclusions can play a significant role in enhancing the toughness of HAZ, this strengthening mechanism can be summarized in two aspects5,6. Firstly, it involves the refinement of austenite grains within the HAZ.During the welding thermal cycle, the inclusions act as anchors, effectively immobilizing the movement of austenite grain boundaries.The atoms are disordered at the grain boundaries, the energy is high, it is easier to give priority to phase change.If the austenite grain size is too large, on the one hand, the site of bainitic ferritic core is reduced, on the other hand, the lath structure grows along the width direction, and then the massive ferritic is distributed along the austenite grain boundary7–9.This inhibition of austenite grain growth reduces the size of grain boundary ferrite (GBF) and ferrite side plate (FSP).
Secondly, during the cooling phase of the welding process, the inclusions facilitate the formation of acicular ferrite (AF) during the austenite-to-ferrite transformation. In this way, the parent austenite grains are segmented into smaller parts by intragranular AF .High deformability of AF allows it to alleviate local stress concentrations, hinder crack nucleation and growth, and thus improve toughness.Under the conditions of high heat input during welding, the spontaneous nucleation of AF is influenced by the slow cooling rate within the HAZ.Many scholars have increased the proportion of AF in steels by adding fine OPEN School of Materials and Metallurgy, University of Science and Technology Liaoning, Anshan 114051, Liaoning, China.*email: qihang25@163.com; liweijuan826@163.com 2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:19459 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-70562-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports/inclusion particles as nucleating agents for AF formation.
Wan, for example, constructed a three-dimensional model of AF through continuous slice isothermal transformation experiments, demonstrating that small nonmetallic inclusions play a significant role in intragranular nucleation of AF10. In high-nitrogen vanadium alloy steels, V(C,N) nanoparticles can serve as effective nucleation sites for AF formation11.Small TiN particles can also promote the intragranular nucleation of AF12.Wang et al.13 have demonstrated that Ti-Ca-O-Mn-S complex inclusions exhibit a notable capacity to promote the formation of AF .Furthermore, Xu et al.14 have reported that MgO-MnS inclusions with a size of about 2µm can easily induce AF nucleation at a heat input of 400 kJ/cm.Coarsened TiO 2 and Ti-Ca-Zr-Al-O-Mn-S complex inclusions can also effectively induce AF nucleation15.Zhu et al.
have shown that fine dispersed particles formed following the Mg treatment not only promote the formation of intragranular AF but also provide a beneficial “napping-effect” , thus improving the low-temperature toughness of the HAZ16. At present, high heat input welding steel prepared with Ti, Al and other elements is widely used, but the steel plate prepared with Mg deoxidation is rarely used, mainly because of the insufficient research on its HAZ transformation theory during the welding thermal cycle.In the present study, we employed scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and laser confocal microscopy (CLSM) to study the evolution of microstructure within the HAZ of EH36 steel under the conditions of different welding heat input.We also examined the impact toughness variations as well as the mechanism of nucleation induced by magnesium inclusions.
This research may serve as a theoretical foundation for achieving the efficient steel welding practices of Mg deoxidized steel and obtaining favorable mechanical properties. Experimental The chemical composition of the experimental EH36 steel is given in Table 1.The 246 mm thick EH36 casting blank was rolled into 36 mm thick experimental EH36 steel by means of thermo-mechanically controlled processing (TMCP).Axio Vert.A1 Zeiss inverted light optical microscope (OM) and the ZEISS EVO Ma10 SEM were used to examine the microstructure of the experimental EH36 steel after TMCP as well as after welding with different heat inputs.The change of main inclusions in EH36 steel under equilibrium condition was calculated by FactSage, the largest fully integrated database computing system in chemical thermodynamics.Figure 1a shows the microstructure at 1/4 thickness of the experimental EH36 steel after TMCP .
The microstructure was composed of polygonal ferrite (PF), pearlite (P) and granular bainite (GB). Figure 1b shows the temperature ranges of thermochemical stability of the main inclusions in the experimental EH36 steel predicted by the FactSage computing system.Simulated welding thermal cycle experiments were performed using THEMECMASTOR-100KN thermal simulation test machine.The samples for these experiments were produced by cutting the EH36 steel plate at 1/4 thickness in direction parallel to the rolling direction, which was followed by machining to achieve standard sample size with dimensions of 140 mm × 11 mm × 11 mm.The experimental process is shown in Fig.2.The heat inputs were 150 kJ/cm, 250 kJ/cm and 350 kJ/cm, whereas the corresponding cooling times ( t8/5 ) were 54 s, 88 s, and 125 s.t8/5 was calculated using Eq.( 1)17.It refers to the time it takes for the weld seam and HAZ to cool from 800 to 500 ◦C.Table 1.

The low-temperature pendulum impact testing was performed at −40◦C . The samples with dimensions of φ7.5 mm × 2.5 mm were cut at 1/4 thickness of the experimental EH36 steel plate for an in-situ observation of inclusions under the VL2000DX laser confocal microscope.During the in-situ experiments, the temperature of samples was first increased to 1350◦C at a heating rate of 10◦C /s and then kept constant for 2 s.Afterwards, samples were cooled to room temperature at cooling rates of 5.4◦C/s, 3.4◦C/s, and 2.4◦C/s.Results Microstructure and mechanical properties of welding heat affected zone Figure 3 shows the microstructure of HAZ in the experimental EH36 steel at welding heat input of 150 kJ/ cm, 250 kJ/cm, and 350 kJ/cm.Under three distinct welding heat inputs, the microstructure of the HAZ in the experimental EH36 steel exhibited the presence of GBF , GB, AF , and a small amount of P .
As the welding heat input increased, the volume fraction of AF and GB in the experimental steel gradually decreased. Conversely, the volume fraction of GBF experienced a significant increase.Moreover, its average grain size underwent noticeable changes that will gradually evolve into large PF .Previous studies18–20 have shown that the decrease of volume fraction of GB and AF and the increase of large GBF in iron and steel materials reduces the mechanical properties of the material itself.In situ observation under different heat inputs Solid solution and precipitation behavior of inclusions At welding heat input of 250 kJ/cm, the laser confocal microscope was used to investigate the thermochemical stability (dissolution and precipitation) of inclusions during heating and cooling of HAZ in the experimental EH36 steel (Fig.4).During heating, austenitization was observed at 903◦C as well as small amount of grain boundary inclusions.
Based on the experimental EH36 steel composition and thermodynamic calculations (Fig. 1b), dark particles maybe TiN inclusions, as indicated in Fig.4a.When the temperature rose to 949◦C , the inclusions accumulated and grew (Fig.4b).The inclusions were dominantly dissolved when temperature reached 1045◦C (Fig.4c).Only a small amount of inclusions was present in the matrix.According to thermodynamic calculations (Fig.1b), TiN particles dissolved at this temperature, whereas a small amount of residual inclusions was assigned to MgAl 2O4.During heating, the temperature was increased until it reached its peak at 1350◦C when samples were subjected to cooling.During cooling, when temperature dropped to 1160◦C , inclusions (probably MnS or TiN) began to precipitate (Fig.4d).The precipitation of inclusions was nearly completed at 801◦C (Fig.4e).They were present within the austenite grains and at the austenite grain boundaries.Their distribution was relatively uniform.
Figure 5 shows the thermochemical stability (dissolution and precipitation) of inclusions investigated by laser confocal microscopy during heating and cooling of HAZ in the experimental EH36 steel when welding heat input of 350 kJ/cm was employed. According to in-situ observations and thermodynamic calculations, the inclusions detected at 895◦C during heating may attributed to TiN (Fig.5a).As the temperature continued to rise, the “TiN inclusions” grew (Fig.5b).When the temperature reached 1320◦C , one portion of “TiN inclusions” grew (1) t8/5=E 2π/afii9838[1 500−T0−1 800−T0] Fig.2.CGHAZ thermal cycle curve.4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:19459 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-70562-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports/(white circle, Fig.5c), while other dissolved (yellow circle, Fig.5c).When temperature reached its peak ( 1350◦C ) during heating, the samples were subjected to cooling.
During cooling, at 1170◦C , the inclusions preferentially precipitated around the austenite grain boundaries. As the cooling continued, “Ti-V-C-N” complex inclusions further precipitated and grew (Fig.5e).Fig.3.Microstructure of welding heat affected zone under different heat input conditions (a ) 150 kJ/cm; (b ) 250 kJ/cm; (c ) 350 kJ/cm; (d ) Impact energy of tested steel.Fig.4.Dissolution and precipitation process of inclusions at 250 kJ/cm heat input (a –c) Heating process; (d –e) Cooling process.5 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:19459 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-70562-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports/When the welding heat input was 250 kJ/cm, the number of inclusions in the experimental EH36 steel was 285/mm2 .At 350 kJ/cm, it was 228/ mm2 .Therefore, the number of inclusions decreased and their average size increased as the welding heat input increased.
On one hand, as the welding heat input increases, the cooling rate following welding decreases, leading to a reduction in the driving force for the nucleation of inclusions. On the other hand, under conditions of low cooling rates, inclusions have more time for growth due to the Ostwald effect.In addition, this growth process tends to absorb smaller surrounding inclusions.As a result, the average size of inclusions increases, while their overall number decreases.This analysis and the results obtained in the present study align with the research findings presented in previous research study21.Bainite ferrite transformation process Figure 6 shows the in-situ evolution of microstructure in the experimental EH36 steel at the welding heat inputs of 150 kJ/cm, 250 kJ/cm and 350 kJ/cm.When the welding heat input was 150 kJ/cm, the phase transition start temperature was detected to be 605 ◦C (Fig.6a).BF nucleated mainly at the grain boundaries and inclusions (Fig.6b).
Figure 6c and d show the growth of BF which previously nucleated at grain boundary inclusions and austenite grain boundaries. When temperature reached 507 ◦C during cooling, the phase transition was terminated.Figure 6f–j show the in-situ phase transformation in the experimental EH36 steel at welding heat input of 250 kJ/cm.The phase transition start temperature was 644 ◦C (Fig.6f).The BF nucleated mainly at the inclusions and austenite grain boundaries (Fig.6f and g).Figure 6h and i show the growth of BF which previously nucleated at the inclusion and austenite grain boundaries.When temperature reached 526 ◦C during cooling, the phase transition was ended.Figure 6k–o show the in-situ phase transformation in the experimental EH36 steel at welding heat input of 350 kJ/cm.The phase transformation start temperature was 689 ◦C (Fig.6k).BF mainly nucleated at intragranular inclusions and austenite grain boundaries (Fig.6i and m).
Figure 6l and n show the growth of BF which previously nucleated at inclusions and austenite grain boundaries. When temperature reached 538◦C during cooling, the phase transition was completed.Discussion Figures 3 and 6 show that the BF nucleation sites in the experimental EH36 steel were mainly located at the austenite grain boundaries, phase interfaces, and inclusions.Therefore, inclusion and interfacial induced ferrite nucleation will be discussed, respectively.Fig.5.Dissolution and precipitation process of inclusions at 350 kJ/cm heat input (a –c) Heating process; (d –e) Cooling process.6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:19459 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-70562-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports/Mechanism of inclusion on ferritic nuclei Figure 7 shows that inclusions promoted AF nucleation.According to thermodynamic calculations (Fig.1b) and EDS analysis (Fig.7b), it could be determined that the inclusion was a complex inclusion of TiN, MnS and MgAl 2O4 .
At present, it is generally believed that there are four mechanisms by which inclusions promote AF nuclei: stress-strain induction mechanism, lattice mismatch mechanism, low interfacial energy mechanism, and solute element-poor region mechanism22,23. Based on the above four nucleation mechanisms, the mechanism of AF nucleation induced by TiN and MgAl 2O4 is discussed below.(1) Stress-strain induction mechanism The thermal expansion coefficient of austenite between 0 and 800 ◦C is 20×10−6 .According to the stress- strain induction mechanism, a large stress-strain field is formed around the inclusions during the cooling.This distortion may provide the activation energy for the ferrite nucleation.The greater the matrix stress, the greater the driving force required to meet the AF core, rendering the AF formation more probable24.The coefficients of thermal expansion for some inclusions were calculated.They are presented in Table 225–27.
Previous studies have shown that the coefficient of thermal expansion of MgAl 2O4 is low, and, theoretically, the stress-strain induction mechanism should be one of the reasons for MgAl 2O4 to induce the formation of AF nucleates. However, Lee28 has found by calculating the interfacial stress and strain energy that the thermal strain energy Fig.6.In-situ observation of phase transformation process at different heat iput energy (a –e) 150 kJ/cm; (f –j) 250 kJ/cm; (k –o) 350 kJ/cm.Fig.7.Acicular ferrite nuclei induced by MgAl 2O4.7 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:19459 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-70562-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports/between MgAl 2O4 and austenite is very low.It has little effect on nucleation of intragranular AF .Therefore, the stress-strain induction mechanism cannot explain the AF nucleation induced by MgAl 2O4.(2) Lattice mismatch mechanism The Eq.
( 2) is employed for calculation of two-dimensional lattice mismatch29: where (hkl )s and (hkl )n are a low exponential crystal plane of the matrix phase and the nucleating core phase, respectively; [uvw ]s and [uvw ]n are a low exponential orientation on (hkl )s and (hkl )n , respectively. di [uvw ]s and di [uvw ]n are the atomic distances along the [uvw ]s and [uvw ]n directions, respectively.According to the two-dimensional lattice mismatch Eq.(2 ), the lattice mismatch of MgAl 2O4/α−Fe was calculated.The calculation results are shown in Table 3.The results show that the lattice mismatches of Fe(100)/ MgAl 2O4(100) (100) and Fe(110)/ MgAl 2O4(100) (110) interfaces were only 0.7% and 0.69%.According to Bramfitt two-dimensional lattice mismatch theory30, inclusion can effectively induce nucleation when the lattice mismatch between inclusion and matrix is less than 6%.When the lattice mismatch between the inclusion and the matrix is 6–12%, the inclusion is a medium nucleation phase.
When the lattice mismatch between the inclusion and the matrix is greater than 12%, the inclusion cannot induce nucleation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mechanism of low mismatch is the mechanism by which MgAl 2O4(100) induces intragranular nucleation of AF .(3) Low interface energy mechanism The two-dimensional mismatch of MgAl 2O4(100)/α −Fe was calculated above.It was proven that the two- dimensional mismatch value of Fe(110)/ MgAl 2O4(100) (110) is within the range of effective nucleation induction.For this reason, the Fe(110)/ MgAl 2O4(100) (110) interface was constructed using Materials Studio software to calculate its interface energy.The crystal structures of α−Fe , MgAl 2O4(100) , and Fe(110)/ MgAl 2O4(100) (110) are shown in Fig.8.Surface energy is the energy required to segment a cell along a given plane.For non-polar surfaces, the Eq.
(3 ) is used for calculating surface energy31: where, Eslab is the energy of the slab model, n is the number of atoms, Ebulk is the energy of the cell, and A is the surface area of the cell. After calculation, it was obtained that σMgAl 2O4 is 2.39 J/ m2 and σα−Fe is 2.27 J/ m2.Another important interface parameter is the adhesion work of the interface, which defines the reversible work required to separate an interface into two free surfaces and represents the bonding strength of the interface.The calculation Eq.( 4) is shown below32:(2) δ(hkl )s (hkl )n=3∑ i=1[⏐⏐⏐( di [uvw]scosθ−di [uvw]n) /di [uvw]n⏐⏐⏐] /3×100% (3) σ=(Eslab−nEbulk)/2ATable 2.Thermal expansion coefficient between inclusion and austenite (0–800 ◦C , 10−6/◦C)26,27.Inclusion Coefficient of expansion Inclusion Coefficient of expansion MnS 18.1 CaS 14.7 CaO 13.5 TiO 10.0 TiO 2 8.2 Al2O3 8.0 TiN 9.4 MgO 13.5 CaO ·Al2O3 6.5 MgAl 2O4 8.4 Table 3.

The calculated result was Wad=3.34 J/ m2.The stability of the interface can be determined by the interface energy γint .The lower the interface energy is, the more stable the interface is.Its calculation Eq.
( 5) is shown below33: The calculated γint was 1.32 J/ m2 . The interfacial energies of stable interfaces between different inclusions and α−Fe were calculated (Table 4).The inclusions in Table 4 have been reported in many previous studies that are able to effectively induce the formation of AF .In comparison, the interfacial energies of Fe(110)/ MgAl 2O4 (110) are in a lower range.Therefore, the Fe(110)/ MgAl 2O4(110) interface is stable.It is concluded that the low interfacial energy mechanism is suitable for explaining MgAl 2O4 induced AF nuclei.In addition, the temperature change will also have a certain impact on the interface energy.
For example, the increase of temperature will weaken the binding force between the interface atoms, reduce the surface free energy of ferrite and inclusion, and make the atom diffusion faster, which is conducive to the interface atom rearrangement and reduce the interface mismatch, which will further reduce the interface energy to a certain extent.34–37 (4) Mechanism of manganese poor zone Figure 9 shows the face scan image of MgAl 2O4 . Wang et al.discussed the mechanism of Ti-Ca-O-Mn-S inducing the AF nucleation.They argued that the reduction of manganese content reduced stability of austenite and increased the driving force of ferritic phase transition38.Figure 9b shows the distribution of Mn element in the inclusion without obvious Mn concentration gradient.Therefore, the Mn-poor region mechanism is not suitable for explaining the MgAl 2O4-induced AF nucleation.In summary, AF nucleation can be induced.
The nucleation mechanism is probably a combination of low lattice mismatch and low interfacial energy mechanism. In Figs.7 and 9, it was observed that the inclusion promoted the formation of slatted AF microstructural at a relative macroscopic scale.Further fine microscopic observation of the HAZ microstructural revealed obvious AF slatted cluster structure, as shown in Fig.10.Small TiN and VN inclusions in the figure both play a role in promoting AF nucleation.At the same time, the AF distribution of multiple orientations is increased due to its dispersion in different locations in the tissue, which will be conducive to improving the performance of the base material.Mechanism of welding heat input on grain boundary ferrite transformation Figure 11 shows the functional relationship between austenite grain size and the number of ferritic nucleation at austenite grain boundaries and intragranular inclusions in the experimental EH36 steel at different welding heat inputs.
In general, during the recrystallization of austenite, a smaller austenite grain size implies a higher density of austenite grain boundaries, resulting in an increased probability of ferritic nucleation at the grain boundaries. The figure illustrates that, under the same welding heat input, austenite with different grain sizes exhibited different behavior.It becomes evident that as the grain size of austenite increased, the number of (4) Wad=1 A( ESlabA+EslabB−EA/B) (5) γint=(σA+σB−Wad) Fig.8.Crystal structure for calculation (a ) α−Fe ; (b) MgAl 2O4(100) ; (c) Fe(110)/ MgAl 2O4(100) (110).Table 4.

10 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:19459 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-70562-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ferritic nucleation sites at the grain boundaries decreased, and the intragranular inclusions provided more ferritic nucleation sites. As the welding heat input increased, the cooling rate within HAZ decreased.Consequently, this led to a reduction in the supercooling degree of austenite to ferrite phase transition.This resulted in an increase in the temperature at which the ferrite phase transition occurs (Fig.6a,f,k).Furthermore, the slower cooling rate caused a significant growth of austenite grains.This growth enhanced stability of austenite grains, thus hindering the transformation of ferrite at the austenite grain boundaries39.As can be seen from the HAZ microstructure image after welding (Fig.
3), the GBF content in the experimental steel increased with the increase of the welding heat input, while the GB and AF content gradually decreased, which is also shown schematically in Fig. 12.Under the same conditions, GBF exhibits a higher transition temperature compared to GB and AF .When the heat input is low, resulting in the faster cooling rate and smaller austenite grain size, the grain boundary size remains small.The last is less favorable to the growth of GBF .The faster cooling rate also promotes a rapid phase transition to AF , resulting in a formation of significant amount of AF .According to Figs.6 and 11, as the welding heat input increased, the cooling rate within HAZ decreased, leading to larger austenite grain sizes and higher phase transition temperatures.Consequently, ferrite preferentially nucleated at austenite grain boundaries, increasing the GBF content.
Additionally, the number of GBF which nucleated at grain boundaries increased, occupying more nucleation sites at grain boundaries. This resulted in a decrease in the number of AF nucleation sites at the grain boundaries, and, therefore, in a decrease in the GB and AF content.Furthermore, Fig.6 shows that the temperature range of the phase transition increased from 98 to 151 ◦C .The phase transition time was prolonged, which provided thermodynamic conditions for the growth of the grains.Considering the low temperature toughness between the HAZ and the base material, a small toughness gradient is required to prevent the phenomenon of stress concentration during the application, which usually leads to material failure.Therefore, the welding heat input of 150 kJ/cm not only improves the welding efficiency but also ensures that the HAZ in the experimental EH36 steel has excellent impact toughness.
Conclusions • When the welding heat input ranged between 150 and 350 kJ/cm, the microstructure in the experimental EH36 steel consisted of GBF , AF , GB, and a small amount of P . As the welding heat input increased, the austenite grain size increased, resulting in a decrease in the content of AF and GB, while the content of GBF increased and the grain size became coarser.When the welding heat input was increased from 150 to 350 kJ/ cm, the impact toughness decreased from 174 to 67 J at − 40 ◦C.• Laser confocal in-situ observation demonstrated that locations of BF nucleation are grain boundaries, twin boundaries, BF/austenite phase interfaces, grain boundary inclusions, and intragranular inclusions.MgAl 2O4 may induce AF nucleation, whereas the nucleation mechanism is probably a combination of low mismatch and low interfacial energy.• Under the conditions of the same welding heat input, larger austenite grain sizes result in less ferrite nucleation sites at the grain boundaries.
Conversely, the intragranular inclusions will provide more nucleation sites for ferrite. When the heat input is low, the cooling rate is faster.Because GBF has a higher transition temperature than AF , a faster cooling rate promotes a rapid phase transition temperature to AF , resulting in a formation of significant amount of AF .Therefore, when the welding heat input is 150 kJ/cm, the welding efficiency can be improved, while the HAZ of the experimental EH36 steel can be guaranteed to have excellent impact toughness.Fig.12.Schematic diagram of nucleation position and final state of microstructure.11 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:19459 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-70562-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports/Data availability All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article.Received: 11 June 2024; Accepted: 19 August 2024 References 1.Han, I.W ., Park, Y .H., An, G.B.& An, Y .H.
