We also used multivariable linear regression to calculate adjusted mean differences in cognitive scores, and 95% CIs, across tertiles of plasma PLPat baseline, as well as cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with individual test scores.Results: Inanalysesadjustedforpotentialconfounders,theORofhavingamajor2-ydeclineinglobalcognitivefunction was 2.46 (95% CI: 1.49, 4.05; P-trend: 0.001) among participants in the lowest tertile of PLP compared with those in the top tertile of PLP . The association of PLP with cognition was stronger in participants older than 55 y at baseline (OR for bottom to top tertile: 4.58; 95% CI: 2.02, 10.35; P-interaction: 0.01) compared with those 55 y old or younger, as well as in ever smokers (OR for bottom to top tertile: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.45, 6.19; P-interaction: 0.02) compared with never smokers.Conclusions: Lower baseline plasma PLP was associated with increased odds of 2-y cognitive decline in a cohort of Boston area Puerto Ricans.
The association was stronger among older participants and among ever smokers.

Nutrient deficiency is an important and modifiable target in the searchfor potential risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer disease (2).Deficiency of B-vitamins has been suggested as a key risk factor linked to cognitive decline.Most prior studiesof B-vitamins and cognition have focused on vitamin B-12, folate, and plasma homocysteine ( 3,4).Few have examined whether vitamin B-6 deficiency may be related to cognitivedeclineindependentlyofotherB-vitaminsandhomocysteine( 5– 7).Most such studies have reported inconsistent findings ( 4,8), largelyduetovariationsinstudydesign,outcomemeasures,andstudy populations.Therefore,there is a need for more evidence oftheimpactofvitaminB-6oncognitivefunction,independent of other B-vitamins.

Puerto Ricans living in the United States represent a significant portion of the US Hispanic population, with well- documented health disparities compared with non-Hispanicwhites as well as Mexican Americans. To our knowledge, no studies to date have focused on the association between plasma vitamin B-6 and cognition in Puerto Ricans.Previous studieshave shown that Puerto Rican adults living in Massachusetts suffer disproportionally from depression,type 2 diabetes,heart disease, and cognitive impairment ( 14–17), compared with nonminority Caucasians.Thus,it is important to identify mod- ifiable factors that might be contributing to these disparities.The Boston Puerto Rican Health Study Cohort (BPRHS) hascollectedextensivedietaryandlifestyledatainadditiontoblood measures and baseline and 2-y follow-up cognitive assessments, making it ideal for examining the impact of plasma pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP, vitamin B-6) on cognition.
In this study, we examined whether low plasma PLP status was associated with baseline cognition and 2-y cognitive decline in the BPRHS. Methods Study design and participants The BPRHS was approved by Institutional Review Boards at Tufts University and the University of Massachusetts Lowell.All studyparticipants provided written informed consent.Study design, method-ology, recruitment and selection of participants, procedures of bloodcollection,measurementofvitaminB-6status,cognitiveassessment,andinformation regarding relevant covariates were described in previouspublications ( 9,18–21).Briefly, 1499 participants in the Boston Puerto Rican Study were 45–75 y old at baseline.Eligible participantswere enrolled if they self-identified as Puerto Rican, were able to answer questions in English or Spanish, and lived in the Boston, MA metropolitan area at the time of the study.Study participants wereexcluded if they had a low score ( ≤10) on the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) ( 22).
This cutoff indicates severe dementia; we included this cutoff not for the purposes of excluding demented individuals but asan effort to limit floor effects for the other cognitive tests administeredto this cohort. Participants completed cognitive testing at baseline andat the 2-y follow-up.The participants underwent anthropometric andblood-pressure measurements at study baseline and provided a bloodsample.They completed cognitive testing at baseline and year 2 offollow-up, as detailed below.Plasma vitamin B-6 exposure PlasmavitaminB-6wasmeasuredasPLP,usingtyrosinedecarboxylase,as described by Shin-Buehring et al.( 23).The samples were light protected.The intra- and interassay CVs for the PLP assay were 5%and 6–8%, respectively.In our study sample, plasma PLP ranged from 7.2 to 737 nmol/L with a mean of 57.0 nmol/L.
Assessment of cognitive function Study participants completed a cognitive testing battery administered by a trained research assistant in either English (2%) or Spanish (98%)(20).The MMSE was administered to assess general cognitive function (possible score range: 0–30) ( 24). Cognitive tests were administered from the neuropsychological battery of Artiola I Fortuny et al.
( 25), which was designed and validated to assess Spanish-speaking residentsofNorthAmerica:a16-wordlistlearningtasktoassessverbalmemory,with subscores including learning and immediate recall (the sum ofwords recalled over 5 learning trials; possible score range: 0–80),recognition(thenumberofwordsdiscriminatedcorrectlyfromalongerword list after a 25–35 min delay; possible score range: 0–16), andpercentage retention (calculated by dividing the number of wordsrecalled after the delay by the number of correct responses on the fifthlearningtrial;possiblescorerange:0–100);digitspanforward(possible score range: 0–16) and backward (possible score range: 0–14),to assess attention and working memory; the Stroop test (min score 0 and noupper limit), to measure cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, andprocessing speed; and letter fluency (min score 0 and no upper limit),toassessthespeedatwhichonecanprovideexemplarstoacategory(three1-min trials during which participants were asked to name as manywords as they could that start with a given letter).
In addition, clockdrawing (possible range: 0–3) ( 26) and figure copying (possible range: 0–27)tasksweregiven,bothtoassessvisual-spatialorganization.Scoresforfigurecopyingwereweightedforthecomplexityofthefigurecopied:1pointforeasyfiguresand4pointsforthemostdifficult.Higherscoresoneachofthesetestssignifybettercognition.Thesamesetoftestswereadministered at baseline and at the 2-y follow-up. Cognitive outcome variables used in statistical analyses Our primary analyses focused on the association between tertile categories of baseline plasma PLP and a global cognitive change score.Thisscore,describedinpreviouswork( 21),wascalculatedasameanof thezscoresforthe2-ychangesineachofthefollowingcognitivescores: MMSE, word list learning, recognition, percentage retention, Stroop, letter fluency, digit span forward and backward, clock drawing, and weighted figure copying.
For analyses of 2-y global cognitive change,we created a binary variable representing “decline,”which was definedbyadropinglobalcognitivescore ≥1SDfromthegroupmean( 19,27). We also performed cross-sectional analyses of the association betweenbaseline plasma PLP and a baseline global cognitive score (average ofthezscores of the baseline values of the following cognitive scores: MMSE, word list learning, recognition, percentage retention, Stroop,letter fluency, digit span forward and backward, clock drawing, andweighted figure copying).WealsoexaminedassociationsbetweenbaselineplasmaPLPand2-y changeineachindividualtestscore,aswellascalculatingadifferenceinchange in cognitive test score per 1 unit decrease in ln(PLP).Changes inindividualtestscoreswerecalculatedbysubtractingthescoreatbaselinefrom the score at 2 y for each test, thus negative values representeddeterioration and positive values represented improvement in cognitivefunction.
Cross-sectional analyses of the association between baselineplasma PLP and individual cognitive tests were also conducted. The BPRHS also conducted MMSE,but not other cognitive testing, during the 5-y follow-up.We thus examined the association betweenbaseline plasma PLP and 5-y changes in the MMSE.Because a sizableproportion of participants (43%) did not attempt question 8 of theMMSE (counting down from 100 in 7s), for these analyses we recodedthe MMSE scores at baseline and year 5, assigning a value of 0 tocomponent 8 of the MMSE total score if it was not attempted.In addition, and as described previously ( 21), we used principal components analysis to quantify 2 major cognitive function factors:1) executive function and 2) memory, and linked plasma PLP to change in these 2 factors.Based on loadings for individual baseline testscores on the 2 principal components, the individual components weredesignated as measuring the cognitive domains of executive functionand memory.
Composite scores were also computed for year 2 follow-up testing data,using the means,SDs,and scoring coefficients from thebaseline principal components analysis. Difference scores for baseline–follow-up were calculated for each domain, and descriptive statisticswere obtained for these difference scores.For each cognitive domain,“major decline” was defined by a drop of ≥1 SD from the group 636 Palacios et al.

Participants with mean systolic bloodpressure ≥140 mm Hg or a mean diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, or those taking medication for hypertension, were classified ashavinghypertension.Acertifiedphlebotomistdrewfasting(12-h)bloodsamples in the home of the study participants on a day after theinterview. Participants with fasting plasma glucose >7.0 mmol/L or those who reported taking medications for diabetes (insulin or oralmedicines) were classified as having type 2 diabetes ( 28).The TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assay (Applied Biosystems)was used to assess Apolipoprotein E ( APOE) genotype, with a successrate of 95%.Serum vitamin D was measured in fasting blood samples obtained at baseline as 25-hydroxyvitamin D, by extraction followedby 25I radioimmunoassay with a Packard COBRA II Gamma Counter(DiaSorin Inc.).Plasma folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations weredetermined by a radioassay method using a commercially availablekit from Biorad.

First, a model adjusted for age in years, sex, and education (<5th grade,5–8th grade,9–12th grade,some college or college degree, somegraduateschool)wasfitted(Model1in Tables2–4).Subsequently, health-related risk factors for cognitive decline including diabetes(yes/no),smoking (never/past/current),alcohol use (never/past/current),hypertension (yes/no), BMI [normal weight ( <25)/overweight (25– <30)/obese( ≥30)],andpresenceof APOE4(yes/no)wereaddedtothe model (Model 2 in Tables 2–4).Finally,in a third model,other relevant nutrients were added as covariates including ln plasma vitamin C, lnserum vitamin D, ln serum vitamin B-12, ln serum folate, multivitaminsupplement use (yes/no), ln plasma homocysteine, and time in daysbetween the baseline and year 2 visits (Model 3 in Tables 2 and3). Longitudinalmodelsof2-ycognitivechangewereadditionallyadjustedfor the appropriate baseline cognitive score.
We used the missingindicatormethodtoaddressthemissingnessofallcovariates,otherthanthe exposure (plasma PLP), in our models. Participants missing plasmaPLP or those missing the cognitive outcome were excluded from allanalyses.We further examined whether the association between plasma PLP and cognitive decline was modified by age ( ≤55 y compared with>55 y), smoking, and sex by including multiplicative terms in our regression models and conducting stratified analyses.Interactionanalyses were performed for the global cognitive decline logisticregression models by adding an interaction term between the relevanteffect modifier and plasma PLP to the fully adjusted model (Model 3),as appropriate, and using the likelihood ratio test.We conducted sensitivity analyses, adjusting for C-reactive protein (CRP) ( <3 compared with ≥3) (30), a marker of inflammation.
In these models, white blood cell count (10 3/μL) was included with CRP because of the possibility of CRP elevation with recent infection. Wealso performed additional sensitivity analyses adjusting for depressivesymptomology using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depressionscale (CESD) score, household income, marital status (married andlivingwithspousecomparedwithnot),employmentstatus(everworkedcomparedwithnot),andpsychological acculturation scale,sequentiallyand together.
We performed additional sensitivity analyses using acategory of vitamin B-6 defined as low [PLP concentration (c PLP)<30 nmol/L as opposed to ≥30 nmol/L],as well as 3 categories of sufficient (cPLP≥30nmol/L),insufficient(20 ≤cPLP<30nmol/L),anddeficient(c PLP<20nmol/L)insteadoftertiles( 31,32).Toaddressthepossibilityof selection bias due to only including participants with complete baselineand2-ycognitiveassessments,weconductedacross-sectionalsensitivityanalysisamongallparticipantswhohadcognitiveandvitaminB-6dataat baseline ( n=1274).

Results For our analysis, 949 participants had complete cognitive data at baseline and at the 2-y follow-up, as well as nonmissing plasma PLP concentration. Compared with participants whowere excluded owing to missing data on exposure or outcome, included participants were younger (mean ±SD age 56.4 ±7.5 compared with 58.0 ±7.3;P<0.001), had higher baseline MMSE score (mean ±SD: 23.9 ±3.0 compared with 21.1±3.8;P<0.001), and a higher proportion were female (73.2% compared with 60.0%; P<0.001).At baseline, the study population overall had relatively low education, and high prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and overweight or obesity ( Table 1).
Participants in the higher tertiles of plasma PLP had lower BMI ( P-trend 0.006), lower prevalence of current smoking ( P-trend <0.001), higher prevalence of current ( P-trend <0.001) and past ( P- trend =0.002) alcohol use, lower prevalence of high CRP ( P- trend <0.001), lower prevalence of diabetes ( P-trend 0.04), lower concentration of plasma homocysteine ( P-trend 0.001), andhigherhouseholdincome( P-trend <0.001)comparedwith those in the lowest tertile. Participants in the higher tertiles of plasma PLP had higher plasma vitamin B-12 ( P-trend <0.001), folate ( P-trend <0.001), and vitamin C concentrations ( P- trend <0.001)andweremorelikelytobemultivitaminusersat baseline( P-trend <0.001)comparedwiththoseinthelowerter- tiles.Supplemental Table 1 presents the baseline and 2-y mean and SD of each of the cognitive measures administered in thisstudy.Supplemental Table 2 presents the normative cognitive tscores for our study participants.
Plasma PLP was not associated with global cognition at baseline after adjusting for potential confounders. In fully adjusted models, the mean difference in baseline global cognitive score, comparing the lowest to the highest tertile ofplasma PLP, was − 0.07 (95% CI: −0.15, 0.02), and when comparing the middle to the highest tertile it was −0.05 (95%CI:−0.13, 0.03).These results are presented in Table 2.For context,the mean difference in cognition associated with 1 y of aginginthiscohort,afteradjustmentforsexandeducation,was−0.018 (95% CI: −0.022, −0.013).Longitudinally, we found that the odds of major decline, defined as being ≥1 SD below the mean 2-y decline in global cognition, was 2.46 (95% CI: 1.49, 4.05) when comparing participantsinthelowesttothoseinthehighesttertileofPLP( P- trend across tertiles: 0.001) ( Table 4).
The association between low PLP and cognition was stronger among participants older than 55 y (OR for comparing the lowest to the highest PLP tertile: 4.58; 95% CI: 2.02, 10.35; P-trend: 0.0003), and was not as strong among those 55 y and younger ( P-trend: 0.21) ( P- interaction with age: 0.01). The association was also stronger among ever smokers (OR for comparing the top to the bottomtertile: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.45, 6.19; P-trend: 0.01) than among never smokers ( P-trend: 0.61) ( P-interaction with smoking: 0.02).We did not observe an interaction of the vitamin B-6–cognition relation with sex ( P-interaction with sex: 0.72).Wefoundassociation,bothatbaselineandover2y,between PLP concentration and performance on several individual cognitive tests.In fully adjusted cross-sectional analyses, baselineplasmaPLPwaspositivelyassociatedwithperformanceon the Stroop test ( P-trend: 0.03) ( Supplemental Table 3 ).
Lower baseline plasma PLP was also associated with negative 2-y changes in recognition ( P-trend: 0.05) ( Supplemental Table 4). Several other associations were marginal, but did not reach statistical significance.We did not observe a significant associationbetweenbaselineplasmaPLPconcentrationand5-ychange in MMSE score ( P-trend: 0.74) ( Supplemental Table 5 ).We did not observe statistically significant associations between baseline PLP concentration and decline in executivefunction or memory component scores.The odds of a ≥1S D decline in executive function for participants in the lowest comparedwiththehighesttertileofplasmaPLPwere1.51(95% Vitamin B-6 and cognition in Puerto Ricans 639 CI: 0.62, 3.69), with a statistically nonsignificant P-trend of 0.19.
Similarly, in logistic regression analyses using a ≥1S D declineinthememorycomponentscoreastheoutcome,theOR for participants in the lowest compared with the highest tertileofplasmaPLPwas1.32(95%CI:0.79,2.32),withastatistically nonsignificant P-trend of 0.26. These results are presented inSupplemental Table 6 .Owing to small case numbers, we were only able to perform analyses adjusted for age, sex, and education because addition of other covariates led to model overfitting, and therefore these analyses should be interpretedwith caution.In sensitivity analyses, adding CRP to our full regression models did not significantly affect the results (OR for 2-y decline: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.48, 4.01; P-trend: 0.01), and there was no effect modification by CRP ( P-interaction: 0.40).
Additional adjustment for depressive symptomology using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score,householdincome,maritalstatus(marriedandlivingwithspouse compared with not), employment status (ever worked compared with not), or psychological acculturation scale did notsubstantiallyaltertheresults.Ourcross-sectionalsensitivityanalysis, including all participants ( n=1274) at baseline with available cognitive scores, regardless of the availability of 2-y cognitive scores, was not substantially different from ourprimary analyses. Discussion In this study of Puerto Rican adults living in the greaterBostonarea,wefoundevidencefavoringanassociationbetweenlower plasma PLP concentration and cognitive decline over 2 y, which is in general agreement with prior studies.The Veterans Affairs Normative Ageing Study of men reported asignificant association between low (PLP <46 nmol/L) vitamin B-6 and cognitive decline over 3 y ( 4).
A recent study in an Irishpopulationof155participants,aged60–88y,alsoreportedsignificant associations between plasma vitamin B-6 status and cognitive decline ( 8). In the MacArthur Study of Successful Aging,vitaminB-6wasassociated,cross-sectionally,withbettercognitiveperformance,althoughprospectiveresultsfocusingon cognitive decline did not show significance ( 33).Our study has several strengths, including the careful assessment of exposures and outcomes.Vitamin B-6 was measured as plasma PLP, which is a more objective measure of vitamin B-6 status than an estimate of dietary intakefrom questionnaires.Cognitive function was measured with an extensive neuropsychological battery of Artiola I Fortuny et al.’s (25), administered by trained study personnel in the native language of the study participants.
Another important strength is the prospective nature of the study, which allowed us to examine change in cognitive function over 2 y as the primary outcome of interest.We were able to adjust for a wide range of potential confounders,including serum concentrations of otherB-vitamins and homocysteine. We considered the possibility that the effect of vitamin B-6 on cognition may be through its impact on systemic inflammation.There was limited evidenceof mediation by CRP, and adding CRP and white blood cell count to our models did not substantially alter the results.However, the interrelation between vitamin B-6, inflammation,and cognition is complex ( 11,34) and there is some evidence that inflammation lowers plasma PLP concentrations ( 35), which must also be considered.The focus on a US mainland Puerto Rican population is also a unique strength of this study, because it provides information on a modifiable dietary risk factor in a distinct and vulnerable population.
However, because of the focus onPuerto Rican adults, our study is not entirely generalizable to other populations. Although we adjusted for a wide range of potential confounders, there may be other unmeasuredvariables that could mediate the association between plasma PLP concentration and cognitive decline.Also, the study did not include clinical assessments of the participants, so we didnot have clinical designations of “normal,” “Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),” or “dementia.” Finally, because of the observational nature of this study, causal associations between plasma vitamin B-6 and cognitive function and decline cannot be established.There remains a possibility that the observedresults are due to reverse causation,or residual confounding by other nutrients, deprivation, or socioeconomic status.Longer follow-up, in this and other cohorts, with better adjustmentfor factors associated with deprivation and socioeconomic status, will be needed to address this issue.
There also remains a possibility of selection bias if participants with low PLPconcentrationanddecliningcognitionselectivelydroppedoutof the study between the baseline and year-2 visits. We conducted cross-sectional sensitivity analyses among all participants whohad available PLP and cognitive data at baseline ( n=1274), regardless of whether they had participated in the 2-y follow- up.Theresultsoftheseanalyseswerenotsubstantiallydifferentfrom our main results.Finally, there is a possibility of a learning effect over 2 y due to participants learning tasks after completing the baseline assessment.Inourstudypopulation,12%ofthepopulationwasdeficient in vitamin B-6 (PLP <20 nmol/L) and an additional 17% was insufficient (20 ≤PLP≤30 nmol/L).Given the findings of this study, more work is needed in both Puerto Rican and other populations to further understand the nature and extent of the association between vitamin B-6 and cognitive decline.
Ifthis association is confirmed, efforts should be taken to reduce vitamin B-6 deficiency.
