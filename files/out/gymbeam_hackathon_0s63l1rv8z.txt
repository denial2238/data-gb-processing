Surprisingly,the 100-year ﬂood (20 July 2021, in Henan, China) did not signi ﬁcantly affect the soil bacte- rial composition compared with previous reports. In contrast, ﬂooding may have brought in nutrients and promoted the propagation of eutrophic bacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant in the Zhangliang region ( ;25%).However, due to the most severe ﬂooding and inundation, the Zhangliang region, also probably contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals, showed the lowest microbial diversity.Moreover, the geographical location in ﬂuenced the microbial communities more than did the soil type or ginger variety.These ﬁndings help us understand the species and composition of bacteria and infection of ginger after ﬂooding and soaking.Further, the interaction mechanisms underlying these emerging phenomena need to befurther investigated.
IMPORTANCE There are few comparative studies on the soil bacterial communities of Chinese ginger varieties after ﬂooding. After a 100-year ﬂood (20 July 2021, in Henan, China), we comprehensively compared the bacterial communities of two types of ginger soils from four different locations.Surprisingly, this ﬂood did not signi ﬁcantly affect the soil bacterial composition compared with previous reports.In contrast, it was found that theﬂooding may have brought in nutrients and promoted the propagation of eutrophic bacteria for the Zhangliang region.However, the ﬂooding had also brought in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination.Moreover, we also veri ﬁed that geographical location in ﬂuenced the microbial communities more than did the soil type or ginger variety.These ﬁndings help us understand the species and composition of bacteria and infection of ginger after ﬂooding and soaking.
KEYWORDS ginger, soil bacterial colony, diversity analysis, ﬂooding disaster Ginger ( Zingiber of ﬁcinale ) has a deep historical background of extensive cultivation worldwide, especially in China, with more than 2,500 years of cultivation since the Spring and Autumn period of China (1, 2). Huaijiang (HJ) ginger, Zhangliang ginger, Panghai (PH) ginger, and Shannong ginger are some of the well-known Chinese ginger varieties.Ginger in Chinese medicines has been used to dispel cold, dispel sweat, pro-mote hair growth, and strengthen the stomach (3, 4).In addition, ginger is an impor- tant ﬂavor seasoning for Chinese cuisine, with the role of removing ﬁshy fragrance, showing its great economic and medicinal value (3, 4).The growth and development of the ginger plant require several nutrients (including nitrogen, phosphorus, andEditor Florian M.Freimoser, Agroscope Copyright © 2023 Li et al.

Recently, with the development ofresearch and technology, second-generation high-throughput sequencing (NGS) tech- nology has emerged, which is a modi ﬁcation of the traditional Sanger sequencing (9–11). This technology can sequence many microbial DNA molecules in the V4 region of a soil sample in parallel in a single run and has a substantial quantitative capability, where the number of times a DNA sample is sequenced directly re ﬂects the DNA abun- dance of that sample.The analysis is usually performed using 16S rRNA sequencingand bioinformatics.Based on the sequencing results, the microbial communities are classi ﬁed by the degree of similarity into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (3, 7, 12).Based on OTUs, researchers can perform various soil microbial characterizations, suchas soil microbial analyses of localized homogeneous environmental species diversity ( a-diversity analysis), principal-component analysis (PCA), and composition analyses of microbial communities (3, 13).
Previous studies have comparatively analyzed the microbial communities of healthy and diseased ginger (3, 7). Also, turmeric and ginger intercropping affects the propor-tion of dominant bacteria and increases the active ingredient contents in patchouli (14).However, fewer studies have focused on the community structure of ginger soil bacteria after the ﬂoods of 20 July 2021, a 100-year ﬂood disaster in Henan Province in north-central China.Many cash crops, including ginger, suffered from ﬂooding and rain inundation for 2 or more months (15).We collected ginger soil samples in September/October 2021, when the ﬂoods had largely subsided.We investigated the effects of ﬂood inundation on the diversity of bacterial colonies in ginger soil for 2 months.Our objective is to compare bacterial rhizosphere community structures of two types of ginger soils from four different locations subjected to a major ﬂood disas- ter.The general technical ﬂow is shown in Fig.1.
RESULTS Data processing and OTU acquisition. After format conversion and sequencing data splitting, we extracted 4,365,450 OTU tags, averaging 136,420.31 OTU tags per group.Tags are the data showing that the ﬁltered sequences correctly overlap and contain the correct barcode and high-quality reads.We obtained 4,198,089 clean OTU tags after low-quality data ﬁltering, with a validity rate of 96.17% and an average of 1,311,190.28 clean OTU tags per group (see Fig.S1 in the supplemental material).Forthe following analyses, clean OTU data were used.To facilitate comparative analyses, four groups were assigned corresponding to the soil collection locations (Table 1).FIG 1 The general technical ﬂow.
The technical process consists of the following six steps: sampling, genome DNA extraction, library construction, NGS, data processing, and statistics and analyses.Ginger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum March/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 2 To identify the sharing and uniqueness of OTUs among groups, we plotted the Venn diagrams under different categorization method conditions (Fig. 2).In the ﬁrst categorization method (category 1, Fig.2A), each group, including the control group, had an amount of unique OTUs (13 to 708 species), with ginger soil in the MZJSH group having 13 unique OTUs (the least) and the ginger soil in the ZLJ group having708 unique OTUs (the most).The number of these unique OTUs (bacterial commun- ities) may be related to soil fertility and geographical location, and the type of these unique OTUs is likely related to the characteristic quality of the local ginger.
However, in this study, the factor of ﬂooding cannot be ignored, especially in the most severely affected regions of Zhangliang. The eight groups also shared 1,399 OTUs.The second categorization method (category 2, Fig.2B) and the third categorization method (category 3, Fig.2D) were classi ﬁed based on region (including the blank con- trol groups) and ginger origin, respectively.In both categorization methods, the shared OTUs were similar, and any of the two groups had shared OTUs.Still, each group had its own unique OTUs.Although the soil types of MZST and MZSH were different, the two groups had the most OTUs in common, probably because their sampling locations are only 2 to 3 km apart.The fourth categorization method (category 4, Fig.2C) was classi ﬁed according to ginger type, with PH ginger, a large ginger bulb variety, having higher diversity than HJ ginger, a small ginger bulb variety, with the two types of gin- ger sharing 13,784 OTUs.Rank abundance curve.
To further investigate the richness and uniformity of the bacterial species contained in each sample, we sorted the OTUs of each sample by abundance and then analyzed their abundance ranking levels. The OTU with the high-est proportion in each group had a similar abundance range (from 0.1% to 1%) (Fig.3).In contrast, the OTUs with low abundance were considerably different (Fig.3; the length of a broken line on the horizontal axis represents the species number of OTU with this abundance).According to category 1 (Fig.3A), the species richness and uniformity of most groups of blank controls were less than their own corresponding ginger soil groups, indicating that the growth of ginger plants also promoted the prosperity of bacterial colony diver-sity.The results were contrasting for the MZSH group, probably because the MZSHBC group ’s sampling site was in the vicinity of the MZJSH group, resulting in little difference between them.In addition, according to categories 1 to 3 (Fig.
3A to C), among the ginger soil groups, MZJST had the most diverse and relatively uniform OTUs, and the ZLJ group had the least, implying that the Zhangliang region has a lower bacterial diversity than others. Regarding ginger varieties (category 4, Fig.3D), the addition of LZJ decreasedthe OTU difference (diversity and uniformity) between the HJ and PH groups.Composition analyses of microbial communities.We analyzed the dominant bac- terial communities at two representative taxonomic levels for the further comparison between groups.The statistical results at both the phylum and genus levels are shown in Fig.4 and in Fig.S2 in the supplemental material.First, at the phylum level, the topTABLE 1 Four categorization methods of ginger soila Soil no.

Four ginger soil groups were set up with their blank controls (BC), each group containing four samples, tota ling 32 samples (Table 2).They were named ZLJ01-04, ZLBC01-04, MZJST01-04, MZSTBC01-04, MZJSH01-04, MZSHBC01-04, LZJ01-04, and LZBC01-04.The nomenclature rules were as f ollows: ZL, MZ, and LZ refer to the sampling site Lushan (Zhangliang township), Mengzhou (Gudan township), and Xinmi (Liuzhai township), respectively.J refers to the C hinese “jiang ”(ginger) abbreviation.

However, some differences in abundance existed among bacterial categories between groups (Fig.4).Among them, [Chlorobacteria] are a special class of Acidobacteria phylum.According to categories 1 to 3 (Fig.4A to C), the bacterial colony composition of the Zhangliang region (ZLJ and ZLBC) was considerably different from that of other groups.
For instance, compared with other groups (Zhangliang versus others), the Acidobacteria -6 (;12.5% versus ;25%), Chloracidobacteria (;2% versus ;10%), and Nitrospirae (;2% versus ;10%) were less abundant in the Zhangliang region. Acidobacteria -6 and Chloracidobacteria can help ginger plants adapt to acidic ecological envi- ronments and absorb their nutrients better.For example, chemoautotrophic bacteria can FIG 2 Identi ﬁcation of the shared and unique OTUs among groups using Venn diagrams.Four different classi ﬁcation methods are presented.(A) The ﬁrst classi ﬁcation method was based on ginger groups and blank controls.(B) The second classi ﬁcation method was based on regions.(C) The third classi ﬁcation method was based on the four ginger groups.(D) The fourth classi ﬁcation method was based on ginger varieties (PH and HJ).The naming rules are as follows.ZL, MZ, and LZ refer to the sampling sites: Lushan (Zhangliang) and Mengzhou and Xinmi (Liuzhai).
J refers to the abbreviation ofChinese “jiang ”(ginger). ST refers to sandy soil; SH refers to the mixed soil of sandy soil and dark loessal soil.In addition, BC refers to “blank control.”Ginger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum March/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 4 take CO2as a carbon source, promoting the circulation and metabolism of iron and elemen- tal sulfur (12).Nitrospirae are Gram-negative bacteria; among them, nitri ﬁers can oxidize ni- trite into nitrate, promoting nitrogen ﬁxation, which is indispensable (12).In addition, compared with other regions, Alphaproteobacteria were more abundant in the Zhangliang region ( ;25% versus ;11%).However, Proteobacteria are considered eutro- phic, and Acidobacteria are oligotrophic (16 –18), suggesting that ﬂooding may have brought in more nutrients and promoted the propagation of eutrophic bacteria in the Zhangliang region.
This may be the ﬁrst consequence of the ﬂooding and soaking. TheGemmatimonadetes in the ZLBC group were more abundant than in other groups.The abundance of Thaumarchaeota was contrasting between the groups.Thaumarchaeota are the only known archaea in nature besides methanogens that considerably participate inthe carbon and nitrogen element cycle (12).Thaumarchaeota in the ZLBC group were sig- niﬁcantly lower.For the Zhangliang region, the difference between the HJ group and the PH group became smaller due to the addition of the Liuzhai region (Fig.4D).At the classlevel, the group ’s classi ﬁcation was similar to that at the phylum level (data not shown).At the genus level (Fig.S2), we compared the bacterial community composition of each FIG 3 Abundance grade analyses of the OTUs of the bacterial communities in ginger soil samples.
The abundance grade curve arranges the OTU in each sample according to its abundance along the abscissa and connects them (the species of OTU with the same abundance) with a broken line according to its abundance as the ordinate to re ﬂect the distribution of OTU abundance in each sample. For each microbial community sample, the curve can directly reﬂect the numbers of high-abundance and rare OTUs in the community.Both the richness and evenness of the species in the sample are explained.The longer or gentler the curve, the more abundant and uniform the diversity of soil bacterial colonies in the region.The shorter or steeper the curve, the less diverse and uneven the bacterial colonies in the soil.(A) The ﬁrst categorization was based on ginger and control groups.(B) The second was based on regions.(C) The third was based on the four ginger groups.
(D) The fourth was based on ginger varieties (PH and HJ).Ginger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum March/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 5 group, especially the top nine dominant bacterial species ( “Candidatus Nitrososphaera, ” Kaistobacter ,Nitrospira ,Planctomyces ,Bacillus ,Rhodoplanes ,Steroidobacter ,Gemmata ,a n d Pirellula ). According to the four categorization methods, the composition of bacterial colo- nies in the Zhangliang region (ZLJ and ZLBC) differed signi ﬁcantly from that in other groups; for example, “Candidatus Nitrososphaera ”(e.g., Nitrospira )i sb e n e ﬁcial for the nitro- gen ﬁxation of ginger, but it is less abundant than others in the Zhangliang region.Meanwhile, Kaistobacter is more abundant than in other regions, indicating that the soil in the Zhangliang region was probably polluted by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or heavy metals (12, 19).
In addition, compared with other regions, the amount of Geobacter in the Zhangliang region was considerably higher than that in the other groups, indicating that the soil was probably polluted by a heavy metal (arsenic [As]) because Geobacter sulfurreducens is positively associated with the migration and transformation of arsenic in soil (20, 21). This may be another consequence of ﬂooding and soaking.Genetic evolution analyses of microbial communities.To display the genetic evolution relationship of bacterial communities in each group, we conducted genetic evolution analyses of the top 60 microbial communities in abundance at the genus level using heat maps (Fig.5).The branch lines of genetic evolution at the top of theﬁgure indicate that the soil bacterial communities from the same region can always cluster together, implying that the closer the sampling location is, the more similar the FIG 4 The bacterial community composition at the phylum level.
The horizontal coordinate refers to each group of ginger soil bacteria. The vertical coordinate refers to the relative abundance of each group.(A) The ﬁrst categorization was based on ginger and control groups.(B) The second was based on regions.(C) The third was based on the four ginger groups.(D) The fourth was based on ginger varieties (PH and HJ).It is worth noting that[Chlorobacteria] are a class of Acidobacteria phylum with a relatively large abundance.Ginger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum March/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 6 soil bacterial communities are (Fig.5A).Especially for category 1, although MZSTBC ’s and MZSHBC ’s soil types were inconsistent, they were clustered together because they belonged to the same Mengzhou region.For category 2 (Fig.
5B), the differences in the bacterial communities between regions were more signi ﬁcant, with almost all bacterial species having different abundances in the four sampling sites. The Zhangliang andLiuzhai regions showed almost opposite microbial abundances, although their gingerspecies were the same.Category 3 results (Fig.5C) showed a similar phenomenon.Theresults of category 4 indicated that the bacterial colony structures of the soil in Mengzhou (HJ ginger) and non-Mengzhou (PH ginger) regions are very different (Fig.5D).The genetic evolutionary tree line on the left represents the species of bacte-ria (with names on the right) clustered together or classi ﬁed in several regions.Diversity analyses.
To assess the richness and diversity of the soil bacterial com- munity of ginger, we ﬁrst calculated the values of a-diversity of the samples using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, v1.9.0) software and three indexesand evaluated the signi ﬁcant differences between groups (Fig. 6).In the cases of cate- gory 1 and category 2 (Fig.6A and B), the three indexes showed signi ﬁcant differences in diversity between groups ( P,0.05).The other two categorization methods (Fig.6C FIG 5 The genetic evolution analyses of microbial communities by heatmap.(Left) Genetic evolutionary tree lines.(Right) The top 60 microbial communities (at the genus level) in abundance.(Top) The clustering relationships between the samples.(Bottom) Sample names.(A) The ﬁrst categorization was based on ginger and control groups.(B) The second was based on regions.(C) The third was based on the four ginger groups.
(D) Thefourth was based on ginger varieties (PH and HJ).Ginger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum March/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 7 and D) showed no signi ﬁcant difference in the a-diversity ( P.0.05). Besides MZSHBC, the diversities in other blank controls were all slightly lower than that in ginger groups (although there might be no signi ﬁcant difference), which was consistent with the above results, also indicating that the growth of ginger plants promoted bacterial di- versity.In contrast, between the ginger groups (Fig.6C), the LZJ group had the highest a-diversity (although the Pvalue was greater than 0.05), which could be attributed to the ginger and cherry intercropping method (Table 2), which usually promotes improved soil quality and microbial diversity (14, 22).
To further compare the b-diversities between multiple groups, i.e., to examine the categorization method effects using OTU data, we performed two statistical methods, PCA and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) (Fig. 7).The results of category 1are used as examples here.As shown in the PCA plot (Fig.7A), the aggregation effect of samples from the same region was evident.The clustering ellipses of the regional samples did not exhibit any overlap.For instance, although MZST and MZSH samples were collected from different sites (2 to 3 km apart), they were clustered together (Fig.7A, upper left) because they belonged to the same region (Gudan township of Mengzhou city).The samples from the Zhangliang region clustered together at the right of Fig.7A and those of the Liuzhai region at the bottom left.The Pvalues between the groups were signi ﬁcant ( P,0.001) in both PC1 and PC2 dimensions.In addition, the separation effect between the groups was satisfactory.
In addition, NMDS analyses results showed similar clustering and separation effects (Fig. 7B).The similarity in the microbial communities within one group(from the same region) was high, and the differences between the groups (from different regions) were also obvious.Also, the analyses of similarities (ANOSIM) (Fig.7C, R=0 .3 8 3 .0a n d P= 0.001) suggested that the differences between the groups were greater than the differences within the groups.Besides, the ANOSIM results also indicate that the categorization method of the samples based on region is meaningful and appropriate.FIG 6 a-Diversity analyses by box plots.Three indexes were used to evaluate a-diversity: Shannon entropy, Simpson index, and Chao index (from top to bottom).(A) The ﬁrst categorization was based on ginger and control groups.(B) The second was based on regions.(C) The third was based on the four ginger groups.(D) The fourth was based on ginger varieties (PH and HJ).
Comparisons between groups were performed using the Kruskal test in R.

Four ginger soil groups were set up with their blank controls (BC), each group containing four samples, totaling 32 samples.

No obvious markers were found for the soil bacterial community in the Liuzhai region. Subsequently, we used a selection of species markers using the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method (based on linear discriminant analysis) and theGraPhlan method (sample community distribution map of species evolutionary tree [datanot shown]).The LEfSe analyses combine linear discriminant analyses with nonparametricKruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests to screen for biomarkers (species that differsigniﬁcantly between groups) between groups.The results of this analysis of dominant species (interspeci ﬁc markers) were slightly different from those of box line plots, but there was some correlation.Consistent with the above results, Alicyclobacillus ,Bacillus ,Phenylobacterium ,Devosia , Burkholderia ,a n d Bdellovibrio were also classi ﬁed as ZLBC markers (see Fig.S3 in the sup- plemental material).Compared to the box plot (Fig.
8D), Flavobacterium was further classi- ﬁed as a marker of the MZJST group (Fig. S3).“Candidatus Nitrososphaera ”was further classi ﬁed as a marker of the MZJSH group.Furthermore, the LEfSe analyses present the re- spective intergroup markers for the ZLJ and LZJ groups (not given in the box plotsabove).Elusimicrobia was classi ﬁed as a marker of the ZLJ group, and Actinomycetospora as a marker of the LZJ group (Fig.S3).Prediction of the metabolic function of bacteria.To predict the metabolic func- tions of the bacterial communities, based on BugBase software, we performed a com-parison of phenotypic classi ﬁcations between groups, including Gram positivity, Gram negativity, bio ﬁlm formation, pathogenicity, mobile components, oxygen demand (including anaerobic, aerobic, and parthenogenic bacteria), and oxidative stress toler-ance (seven categories), taking only the ﬁrst category method as the example (Fig.S4).
As shown, there existed signi ﬁcant differences between groups of aerobic (Fig. S4A), Gram-negative (Fig.S4F), Gram-positive (Fig.S4G), and stress-tolerant (Fig.S4I) bacteria ( P, 0.01).In particular, the relative abundance of the bacterium in the ZLJ and ZLBC groupsshowed signi ﬁcant differences from others.This result indicates that after ﬂooding and soak- ing, the soil bacteria in the Zhangliang region suffered from a more complex soil environment than other groups, requiring more aerobic and stress-tolerant bacteria to maintain the meta-bolic cycle of vital elements and the nutritional requirements of the ginger plants.This is con-sistent with the Zhangliang region suffering from more severe ﬂooding than other regions.DISCUSSION The bacterial diversity of the soil was restored with timely drainage 2 months after the ﬂooding and inundation on 20 July 2021 (15).
In this study, we used 16S rRNA high- throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analyses to compare the bacterial community structures of characteristic ginger soils from three regions in the Henan Province of north-central China. The species of the top 10 bacterial phyla showed high similarity with thosepreviously reported (13), but each accounted for different percentages.With probably themost severe ﬂooding, the Zhangliang region ’s bacterial community structures differed sig- niﬁcantly from others.The bacterial diversity in Zhangliang was relatively lower than others, although the ﬂooding promoted the propagation of eutrophic bacteria.The lands of the Zhangliang region may also be contaminated by PAHs or heavy metals, indicating that the effect of ﬂood soaking on soil microorganisms is twofold.Importantly, the sampled lands of the Zhangliang region require improved management in the future.
PCA showed that the sampling location had the greatest in ﬂuence on the soil bac- terial community characteristics, and the soil bacterial community structure was mostGinger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum March/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 11 similar when sampled from the same region. In this study, although the soil types of MZST (sandy soils) and MZSH (combination) regions were different, their PCA clustered them together.Meanwhile, although the ginger types of ZLJ and LZJ were the same, their PCA results were distinguishing.This result shows that the structure of the soilbacterial community is mainly determined by the geographical location of the sample(23) and its associated climate, environment, and farming practices, and not mainly bythe ginger variety.In other words, geographical location in ﬂuenced the microbial popu- lations more than did soil type or ginger variety, consistent with a previous study (23).
Although the Zhangliang region had the lowest bacterial diversity, the number of unique OTUs was the highest. According to the investigation, the ZLJ group had a large planting region ( ;1k m 2) and inadequate drainage and was most severely affected by ﬂooding; there may be a compensatory increase in aerobic and stress-tolerant bacteria.This suggests that some OTUs may not be ginger soil-speci ﬁc microorganisms in the region but are present due to the ﬂooding.In contrast, Mengzhou had a smaller cultiva- tion region (0.005 km2), drained more rapidly, and was less affected; hence, the unique OTUs in the region may be the microorganisms speci ﬁct ot h i sr e g i o n .The unique OTU analyses may also help enhance the brand characteristics of ancient HJ ginger, thereby improving its brand value.In conclusion, these ﬁndings help us under- stand the species and composition of bacteria (3, 7) and infection of ginger soil afterﬂooding and soaking.
They also guide the signi ﬁcance of conserving ancient characteris- tic ginger varieties and enhancing biological control of plant bacterial diseases (3, 13). MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample information.Two ginger species, PH and HJ, were planted in three types of soil: sandy, red clay, and combination (dark loessal and sandy soils) in three cities of Henan province, China.In total, fourginger (J, short for “jiang ”in Chinese) groups were set up with their corresponding blank controls (blank soil in nearby ﬁeld paths with no crops), each group with four samples, totaling 32 samples (Table 2).They were named ZLJ01-04, ZLBC01-04, MZJST01-04, MZSTBC01-04, MZJSH01-04, MZSHBC01-04, LZJ01-04, andLZBC01-04.The experimental group was sampled in the ginger planting region; the blank group wassampled in the adjacent nonplanting region (Table 2).When sampling, we ﬁrst removed the surface ﬂoat- ing soil and dug the subsurface 15-cm layer of soil using an ethanol-sterilized ﬁre shovel.
After removing visible impurities, each sample group was collected from the four sites, and an appropriate amount of soilsamples was loaded in sterile 2.0-mL centrifuge tubes, each tube accommodating approximately 300 mg.Then, they were immediately kept at 280°C or on dry ice for cryopreservation and transportation. Soil bacterial gDNA extraction and 16S rRNA pyrosequencing.Total genomic DNA (gDNA) of bac- terial soil samples was extracted using the gDNA isolation kit (TianGen, Beijing, China) according to themanufacturer ’s instructions.The quality and quantity of extracted gDNA were determined using agarose gel electrophoresis and Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively.The gDNA was stored at 220°C before further assessment.
The PCR ampli ﬁcation of the bacterial V4 regions of the 16S rRNA genes was performed using the upstream primer 5 9-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3 9and the downstream primer 5 9-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3 9.I n order to differentiate the sample, the speci ﬁc paired-end (PE) barcode (6 bp) was fused into the TruSeq adaptor for high-throughput sequencing. The ampli ﬁcation reaction system (total, 50 mL) contained 25 mL Phusion high- ﬁdelity master mix, 3 mL( 1 0mM) each primer, 10 mL gDNA (as the template), 3 mLd i m e t h y l sulfoxide, and 6 mL double-distilled water (ddH2O).The PCR cycle comprised initial denaturation (98°C for 30 s), followed by 26 cycles of denaturation (98°C for 15 s), annealing (58°C for 15 s), and extension (72°Cfor 15 s), with a ﬁnal extension (72°C for 60 s).The ;450-bp PCR products were puri ﬁed using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and quanti ﬁed by the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
After quanti ﬁcation, all amplicons were pooled in equal amounts (50 ng), and PE 150-bp sequencing was performed using the NovaSeq6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)at GUHE Info Technology Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China).Data analyses.We utilized QIIME software to process the sequencing reads, as previously reported (24).In brief, the raw reads that matched the barcodes were assigned to each soil sample and further iden-tiﬁed as valid data.Besides, low-quality reads with average Phred scores of ,20,,151-bp lengths, ambig- uous bases, and mononucleotide repeats of .8b pw e r e ﬁltered out (25, 26).The PE reads were merged by overlap, and OTUs were picked using Vsearch v2.4.4 (--fastq_mergepairs –fastq_minovlen 5) (27), which included cluster (--cluster_fast, –id 0.97), dereplication (--derep_fulllength), and detection of chimeras (--uchime_ref).
Next, we selected a representative sequence from each OTU using the default parametersand used Vsearch to search the Greengenes database for representative sequences for OTU classi ﬁcation. A table recording the taxonomy and abundance of each OTU for each sample was created.OTUs with an ,0.001% abundance of total sequences across all samples were discarded.To minimize the vari- ation in sequencing depth across samples, an averaged, rounded rare ﬁed OTU table was also generated by averaging a subset of 100 uniformly resampled OTUs below 90% of the minimum sequencing depthfor further analyses.Ginger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum March/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 12 Bioinformatics.The bioinformatics analyses of the sequencing reads were mainly performed using R packages (v3.2.0) and QIIME.
a-Diversity indexes based on OTU level, including the Shannon diversity index, Chao1 richness estimator, and Simpson index, were calculated using the OTU table in QIIME. The ranked abundance curves based on OTU level were generated to compare the richness and evenness of OTUs between groups.The structural variations of microbial communities between groups were also investigated by b-diver- sity analyses based on OTU level, using UniFrac distance metrics (28, 29) and nonmetric multidimensionalscaling (NMDS) (30).PCA was also performed based on the genus-level compositional pro ﬁles (30).The sig- niﬁcance of structural differentiation of bacterial communities between groups was evaluated by permuta- tional multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using the R package “Vegan ”(31).
Venn diagrams were generated using the R package “Venn Diagram ”to visualize shared and unique OTUs between groups, based on the occurrence of OTUs between groups, regardless of their relative abundance (32). Taxon abundances (on the phylum and genus levels) were statistically compared between groups using the Kruskal test in the R statistical package.Linear discriminant analysis effect sizes (LEfSes) were performed to detect taxa with different abundances between groups using default parameters (33).Then, we applied random forest analyses to distinguish the different samples and groups using the Rpackage “randomForest ”with 1,000 trees, with all the settings at the default (34).The generalization error was estimated using the 10-fold cross-validation method.The expected “baseline ”error was also included, obtained from the classi ﬁer that predicts the most common category label.
Cooccurrence analyses were performed by calculating Spearman ’s rank correlations between predominant taxa. Meanwhile, corre- lations with jRHO jof.0.6 and a Pvalue of ,0.01 were visualized as cooccurrence networks using Cytoscape (35).We had predicted microbial functions by phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) based on high-quality reads (36).Besides, we had used thestatistical analysis of metagenomic pro ﬁles (STAMP) software package v2.1.3 for further analyses of the out- putﬁles (37).BugBase is an excellent software program for the measurement of high-level phenotypes within the microbiome (38).FAPROTAX is a data bank that maps prokaryotic clades (e.g., genera or species)to establish metabolic or other ecologically relevant functions (39).Ethics approval and consent to participate.This study did not involve human or animal experi- mental samples.
