Hyperbaric oxygen may helpneonatalhypoxic-ischaemicencephalopathy Hyperbaric oxygen, a treatment frequently used in China, mayreduce mortality andneurological sequelae inneonates with hypoxic-ischaemicencephalopathy. For thissystematic review, Liu andcolleagues (p 374) searchedW estern and Chinese databasesand identified 20 Chinese trialscomparing hyperbaric oxygentreatment with “usual care” forthe severe neonatal condition.Hyperbaric oxygen producedbetter outcomes in most trials,but reporting of methods waspoor by W estern (CONSORT)standards.A good randomisedcontrolled trial is needed toinvestigate the findings,conclude the authors.
Serum vitamin B-12 assay resultscan mislead When interpreting results of serum vitamin B-12 assays it isimportant to take into accountthe overall clinical picture.Devalia (p 385) describes twocases of paradoxical vitaminB-12 results, where meticulousclinical assessment —including assessment of autoimmuneconditions and taking a familyhistory —helped to decide on the best treatment. The firstpatient had symptoms and afamily history of perniciousanaemia, macrocytic anaemia,and thyroid disease.Despite thisthree vitamin B-12 assays werenormal.However, the patientresponded fully to vitamin B-12replacement therapy, andimmunological analysisconfirmed pernicious anaemia,preventing a potentialmisdiagnosis of myelodysplasia,which requires much moreaggressive therapy.For moredetail and the second case,please go to page 385.
W omen exposed to environmentaltobacco smokehave increasedmortality In non-smoking Chinese women exposure toenvironmental tobacco smokeis related to moderatelyincreased mortality from all causes, from lung cancer, andfrom cardiovascular disease.W en and colleagues (p 376)analysed data of over 72 000women who had neversmoked and found thatexposure to tobacco smokefrom husbands was associatedwith increased mortality fromall causes and fromcardiovascular disease.Exposure to environmentaltobacco smoke at work wasassociated with increasedmortality from cancer,especially lung cancer. How to manage psoriasis Because of its chronic, incurable nature, psoriasis isassociated with substantialmorbidity.Anxiety anddepression affect up to 25%of patients, and are oftenmissed.
Patients with severedisease also have an increasedrisk for cardiovascular disease.The clinical review by Smithand Barker (p 380) revisits thecauses and diagnosis of thisinflammatory skin disease,describes its significantclinical effects andcomorbidities, outlines thetreatment options (fromtopical therapy to recentlylicensed biologicaltreatments), and discusseshow treatment should beprovided.The BMJ is published by BMJ Publishing Group Ltd, a wholly ownedsubsidiary of the British MedicalAssociation.

W e know that China is changing, but I was surprised by the commitment to change when Ivisited the Chinese Medical Association in Beijing tocoordinate this issue with guest editors ZhangKonglai, Wang Chen, and Li Li.I met doctors who feltthat China had much to offer the rest of the worldand much to learn from it.
“W e are not used to thisstyle of writing, where you present both theadvantages and disadvantages of a policy and itssuccesses and failures,” said one. “W e need change butchange must be gradual.W e cannot simply copy theW est,” cautioned another.The change from a secretive country to one that welcomes tourists and admits mistakes is refreshing.This change is reflected in this issue.“Honesty isneeded,” is the first lesson we learnt from the SARSepidemic, say Nanshan Zhong and Guangqiao Zengin a candid appraisal of the epidemic (p 389).Theyadmit that regulations were flouted in some researchinstitutions and consider how they might do betterwith the next epidemic.Tuohong Zhang and Y udeChen say in an editorial that China’s communityhealth model is a good way of meeting the needs ofelderly people but admit that its implementation inChina is unsatisfactory (p 363).
T ao Liu alsoemphasises the need to revitalise community healthsystems, which were previously equitable andprosperous but have declined since China’s economictransition (p 365). Mistakes and poor implementationare not unique to China, but admitting and learningfrom them is the way forward for all of us.Arguably China has a cupboard full of skeletons, which it needs to bury decently.For example, its onechild policy has come in for intense criticism from therest of the world.Qu Jian Ding and Therese Heskethfind that since the policy came into force the totalbirth rate and preferred family size have fallen, but(unfortunately and predictably) the ratio of male tofemale births has risen (p 371).The authors argue fora relaxation of this policy and hope that this willreduce the gross imbalance in the sex ratio.W e alsohope it will reduce the atrocities that were attributedto the policy.
An editorial by Malcolm Potts fromCalifornia says the policy produced great pain for onegeneration but a generation later began to yieldsignificant economic benefits (p 361). Unfortunately we don’t have any original research papers in this issue that have come out of China alonewithout W estern collaboration.Sadly no such paperspassed our peer review process, largely because ofproblems of design.But we hope that future BMJ s will have such papers: Chinese researchers are committedto gaining increased visibility internationally and willlearn the rules of the game soon.Rajendra Kale senior clinical editor (rkale@bmj.com)bmj updates + Black cohosh does not relieve menopausal hot flushes Research question Is black cohosh an effective treatment for menopausal hot flushes?Answer No.A standardised preparation of black cohosh works no better than a placebo Why did the authors do the study?Many women take black cohosh for menopausal hot flushes.
It’s a particularly attractiveoption for women who can’t take hormone replacementtherapy because they have had breast cancer or have anincreased risk of breast cancer. Results from small clinical trialshave been mixed, however.These authors wanted moredefinitive data on the effectiveness of this popular herbalremedy.What did they do?132 women took part in a randomised, placebo controlled crossover trial of a standardisedpreparation of black cohosh similar to the popularbrand Remifemin.Two thirds (64%, 74/116) of thoseincluded in the analysis had a history of breast cancer,and 44% (51/116) were taking tamoxifen.Their mean agew a s5 6y e a r s .The women took black cohosh or placebo for four weeks, then crossed over for another four weeks without a washout period.Throughout the trial, which included a baseline week withouttreatment, they kept a daily diary of their hot flushes, ratingtheir severity from 1 (mild) to 4 (very severe).
Scores weretotalled over one week in each phase of the trial. Each week,participants also rated side effects, quality of life, and theirsatisfaction with treatment.They also completed the Greenclimacteric scale at baseline and after each treatment phase.The trial was double blind, and powered to detect a difference between treatments of at least 1.2 hot flushes a day.The mainoutcome measure was the change in hot flush scores betweenthe baseline week and the fourth week of treatment.Theauthors used crossover analyses to confirm these primaryfindings.What did they find?During the first phase of the trial, black cohosh did not reduce the women’s total hot flush scorescompared with placebo (mean reduction 20% for blackcohosh and 27% for placebo).
Nor did it have any impact onfrequency of hot flushes, quality of life, satisfaction withtreatment, or scores on the Green climacteric scale.Crossover analysis of data from the whole nine weeksconfirmed that both groups of women got moderatelybetter during the first two weeks of treatment (whichever itwas) and that the improvement was sustained until the end ofthe trial. What does it mean?Despite promising findings from a pilot study, black cohosh did not work in this population ofmenopausal women who were selected because their breastcancer history or breast cancer risk meant they were unable totake hormone replacement therapy.There’s still room forlarge, sound trials testing bigger doses, different doseschedules, or longer treatment periods.But for now, the weightof evidence does not support the routine use of black cohoshin these women.Pockaj et al.
