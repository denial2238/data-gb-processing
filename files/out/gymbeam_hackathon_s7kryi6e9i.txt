This extraor - dinary advance in human knowledge and the resulting technological achievements should not lend themselves to the fears or fantasies often fueled by those who criticize all scientific progress calling into question the most established dogmas. Certain supposedly scholarly analyses of the health situation with which we are currently confronted worldwide are a perfect illustration of this unfortunate trend.It is undeniable that the progress of molecular genetics has opened up a wide range of applications in many fields, affecting the well-being of humans, their mental and physical health.The apparent universal and individual interest for the most advanced genetic profile analyzing technologies is a testimony to this strong common desire to better understand one’s genetic heritage and to control their usage.
Despite this movement, little attention is given to the recent advances in genetics applied to essential aspects of the social life of individuals through their inter-personal interactions. It is particularly distressing that the contributions of molecular biology and genetics to the daily well-being of individuals have not yet allowed open-access non-medical genetic testing to gain the recognition it deserves and are still viewed as recreational applications.Through an analysis of the cross influences that genetic biotechnologies have had since the beginning of the century in the fields of nutrition and cosmetics, we have tried to project ourselves into the near future which should witness major behavioral and social upheavals.

Genome science will have a real impact on all our lives—and even more, on the lives of our children”. * Bernard Perbal bperbal@gmail.com Sabine Gabaron sgabaron@umich.edu 1 International CCN Society, Marseille, France 2 Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, University of Michigan, 4131 Modern Languages Building, 812 East Washington St, Ann Arbor 48109-1275, USA 484 B.Perbal, S.Gabaron 1 3 It will revolutionize the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of most, if not all, human diseases.” After addressing the compelling question ‘Has the revolution arrived?’ F.Col- lins proposed a few axes of reflection around the protection of individual privacy and effective education of the public about genomic medicine, which still stand today.With regards to applications in the medical field, F.
Col- lins quoted the power of genome-wide association stud- ies in identifying small DNA genomic variations (such as single nucleotide polymorphism known as SNPs) that are associated with the risk of developing common diseases. Today, the progress enabled by the continuous efforts of a community of geneticists who believe in the true power of this approach, in spite of the opposition raised by a few against the significance and applicability of the GWAS, has been exposed in a multitude of medical, psychological and social human conditions.Among these, a wide number of SNPs have been linked to biological processes responsible for aging, such as dermatological conditions resulting from impaired cell communication with their microenvironment subjected to constant biological modulation in response to variable biophysical features.There is no doubt that these SNPs will become powerful tools in the future.
For many years, these conditions were addressed and treated either at the dermatological level under medical sur - veillance or at the cosmetic level by the multitude of com- pounds proposed over the counter to customers eager to fight the manifestations and origins of skin transformations occurring during aging. It is now widely accepted that the traits associated with aging are the visible tip (phenotype) of the huge hidden part (genotype) that is governing human appearances and behaviors.In addition to this purely genetic input, physiological, social and psychological environmental factors are also known to be critical elements contributing to the expression of the individual genomes.The stunning development of genetic applications in various areas that resulted from the rise of human genomic knowledge have had an impact on several aspects of human life.
As revealed by the success of companies that offer molecular genealogy procedures, allowing for the identifica- tion of unknown relatives, a growing number of individuals in developed countries are fascinated by social applications of molecular genetics. On another ground the use of molecu- lar genetics in criminalistic analysis used to solve cold cases has also sparked wide popular interest.While DNA personal data analysis and manipulations have initiated a strong interest in many different fields related to human life comfort, major beauty industries were for a long time reluctant to develop applications drawn from genetics.Only a few of them favourably considered the pos- sibility to take advantage of the molecular genetic-based technologies whose applications are eagerly awaited by cus- tomers.
The transition from the use of cosmetic compounds with alleged scientific activity, to compounds with estab- lished benefits, is more commonly observed nowadays among customers who seem interested in learning about the modes of action of the cosmetics they use. The rise of genomics did not only lead to the development of products showing real effects, such as improvement of skin health, but also resulted in the appearance of companies offering personalized skin care recommendations based on nutrigenomics and cosmetogenomics on the cosmetic mar - ket.Taking advantage of the increasing molecular knowl- edge that accumulates in the field of extracellular matrix reorganization and roles of the matricellular proteins inter - connections with their localized versatile microenvironment should allow, in combination with a comprehensive GWAS (Genome Wide Association Study), for the rise of truly per - sonalized effective cosmetic regimens.
Since it seems important to understand the ins and outs at hand and evaluate the feasibility of the next generation of cosmetic trends and their potential impacts on future human lifestyles, we provide below a comprehensive review of the evolution of the concept of beauty. For a long time, the cosmetics industry tried to make the 50-year-old body look like 25, and applied itself to slowing down the aging process that widens the lines, in order to smoothen the skin that bears the wear of time.The concepts of nutrigenomics, nutrigenetics and nutricosmetics have exceeded the expectations of consumers.1 We will discuss the foundations of the cosmetogenetic revolution that is presently arising.The past, present, and future of the beauty concept What is beauty The concept of beauty has evolved considerably.Initially, beauty was associated with a set of qualities that gave pleas- ure to the senses, generating a satisfaction and an attraction that could not be easily explained.
Beauty combined physi- cal criteria of form and color, with diffuse yet strong feel - ings released by the object or the person that we perceive, approach or touch. 1 Nutrigenomics is a science studying the effects of nutriments on genes expression while nutrigenetics is the science that studies how the genetic constitution of an individual governs their dietary responses.Nutrigenetics aims to establish personalized diets based on the genetic profile of the consumer.Everyone having a different genetic makeup does not have the same metabolism and not all peo- ple react in the same way to the absorption of food products, natural supplements, or mixtures of bioactive nutrients.485 Mastering health: liberating beauty 1 3 With time and technological developments, the sense of beauty has been defined and transmitted.The pleasures of sight and hearing mingled and evolved in accordance with constant shifting aesthetic.Beauty of the lived moments.
Is not the notion of ideal beauty the harmony of beings and the emotions they share? With the relatively recent arrival of photographic analy - sis and retouching technologies, the craftsperson became a magician who revives the taste for dreams for those who lost it.A double-edged sword as we will see below.Beauty plays a fundamental social role in the establish- ment of human relationships, groupings.Little by little, the physical differences were accepted in most societies.Today's cosmetological semantics speak of resilience, inclusiveness, durability, and precision.Beauty and social norms In his model of symbolic interactionism, considered today as the cornerstone of an original philosophical and scientific school in the fields of social psychology, George H.Mead (1934) attributes a preponderant place to individual interac- tions in the construction of human social identity and socio- cultural personality.
This model provides an interesting line of thinking regarding the analysis of the concept of human beauty and its evolution over the past century. According to Mead, the achievement of an individual’s socialization occurs through observation and interaction with others, their responses to the perceptions that others have of them and the integration of external opinions and internal feelings.First, the individual appropriates the social "role" of others, which is significant to them.Stigmata of this phase where the individual wants to resemble the group can be detected in adults, subjected daily to the apology of the perfect body conveyed by the press, the media, advertis- ing campaigns, fashion shows, and beauty contests, all show - casing those who meet "the standards" (Bruchon-Schweitzer 1989).
Thus for years individuals of all ages have embarked on "a frantic search for beautification: avoid gaining weight, limit manifestation of aging, follow fashion trends, use of fragrances, be fit, look tanned" in the hopes to promote their social belonging. A short trip back in time and the roots of modern cosmetology What is beautiful is good The experiments of classification of faces and human bodies carried out some thirty years ago in France and in Anglo- Saxon countries revealed a uniformity in the value judg- ments of the concept of beauty, in individuals of different sexes, social categories and genders.The different percep- tions triggered by attractive individuals essentially reflected their capacities to socialize and their intellectual skills (Eagly et al.1991).The association of beauty with other socially favorable attributes by Dion et al.
(1972), illustrated the survival and reinforcement of old stereotypes according to which “beauty is inseparable from goodness” (Sappho (630–570 BC), Fragment 101, as translated by T.H. Wharton (1887)) and “physical beauty is the sign of an inner spiritual and moral beauty” (Schiller 1875).The different perceptions triggered by attractive individu- als mainly concerned their capacities to socialize and their intellectual skills (Eagly et al.1991).The "what is beautiful is good" motto of Schiller, well anchored in the American culture was coupled with a dimension linked to physical attraction.The modern cosmetic industries will widely use the "inner beauty" as their flagship slogan.Another aspect of human interactions role in the social positioning of the individual was presented by C.Cooley (1902).
According to this author, the image an individual has of themself is based on the idea they have of their per - ception by others « As we see our face, figure, and dress in the glass, and are interested in them because they are ours, and pleased or otherwise with them according as they do or do not answer to what we should like them to be; so in imagination we perceive in another's mind some thought of our appearance, manners, aims, deeds, character, friends, and so on, and are variously affected by it ». It is the concept of the « reflective self», the « self-looking glass», defined by Cooley as « the kind of self-feeling one has is determined by the attitude toward this attributed to that other mind.
A social self of this sort might be called the reflected or looking-glass self: Each to each a looking-glass reflects the other that doth pass» Thus, positive correlations have been established by high school students and adolescents, between psychologi- cal well-being and the level of physical attraction, accord- ing to the beauty of the face, the body size, or by the body mass index (Feingold 1992; Langlois et al. 2000; Griffin and Langlois, 2006; Blote et al 2014).These observations have been reinforced more recently by a study of reciprocal effects on physical attraction (Greitemeyer 2010).Typically, people seem rather drawn to those who love them, and the face is the "common denominator of all emotions".This is when makeup, and therefore cosmetics, play both a role of individual identification and distinction.Modifications of skin color In the first century, Nero and his wife Poppaea used white lead as a make-up to lighten their skin.
This pigment that occurs naturally in the form of hydrocerusite is also known as Saturn White or Silver White. It is a toxic derivative 486 B.Perbal, S.Gabaron 1 3 of lead carbonate.The stereotypes widely disseminated by a specialized press which highlighted the fair-skinned women as a universal model of beauty have led populations in Africa, India, Latin America, and Asia to have their skins depigmented to resemble the Western model, despite the dangers associated with these cosmetic practices.While some wanted to bleach, others wanted to brown … On a social level, one should not overlook the psycho- logical problems associated with changing personal physical identity.As summarized by Céline Emeriau (2009) "At the heart of socio-cultural issues where modernization forces are shaking up the traditional order, the body is the object of an aesthetic quest and the support of an identity construction".
Today this phenomenon tends to be a little better con- trolled with the appearance of dark-skinned models, regard- less of gender, who proudly deploy their natural coloring or pigmentation defects, such as vitiligo, in the advertising releases of the top cosmetics companies in the global beauty industry. However, it must be said that color and pigmenta- tion remain sources of discrimination and social segregation in certain circles.The idea that in any case, "it's not the color of the packaging that matters, but what is in it" (Stockett 2009) is slowly gaining ground in societies around the world."Cosmeceutical" and "active" cosmetics Origins of the active cosmetics concept Over the past two decades, a large number of chemicals and derivatives purified from natural sources have been used by cosmetology companies engaged in the commercializa- tion of allegedly active cosmetic products, also known as "cosmeceutical" in the Anglo-Saxon cosmetic industries throughout the world.
Invented by Raymond Reed in 1961, the term cosme- ceutical is the contraction of cosmetics and pharmaceuti- cals. Albert Kingman, convinced that the modification of a physiological function by a dermo-cosmetic constitutes the basis of modern cosmetology, will give this field its letters of nobility (Kligman 2000).The enthusiasm has been over - whelming, not only across the Atlantic, but also in Europe.
Although the American Food Drug and Cosmetic Act does not recognize the term "cosmeceutical", the last two decades have seen the development of a multitude of lines of cosmetic products despite an often lack of solid scientific validation of their claimed beneficial activities For exam - ple, the harmful effects of lightening creams, which are still widely used today, in the treatment of freckles or other pig- mentary manifestations that may appear during aging and pregnancy in some women, are numerous.Chemicals cosmetics treatments and lack of transparency Some treatments, presented as the best, are based on the use of lightening creams known to be effective against spots and blackheads, but also to erase signs of skin aging thanks to their nourishing properties. The compounds that they con- tain to fight against the unwanted effects of exposure to sun- light, act on melanin metabolism, cell renewal, free radicals, skin pH, to cite a few.
It is dangerous to claim that hyperpigmentation treat- ments using dermo-cosmetics that contain active ingredients potentially capable of interfering with the metabolism of the constituents of the skin are innocuous. Many chemical or natural derivatives commonly used in cosmetic whitening or lightening treatments, and considered to be harmless, must however be used with great caution and under medically validated conditions.For example, hydroquinone, consid- ered as a miracle skin whitening product for a long time, is a potentially carcinogenic agent.The use of hydroquinone in skin creams is now banned in several countries such as the 27 countries of the European Union, Japan and South Africa.Along the same line, the FDA announced on October 7, 2021 “removing the stay of the final rule Termination of Listing of Color Additives Exempt From Certification; Lead Acetate, effective January 6, 2022.
The final rule issued in October 2018 (83 FR 54,665), was stayed because the FDA received objections and a public hearing request within the allowable timeframe (84 FR 12,081). The FDA has deter - mined that objections that do not raise issues of material fact justify a hearing”.2 A growing number of consumers are concerned about the lack of transparency regarding the composition of the cosmetic products they use.Trendy advertising campaigns promising to carefully select ingredients that preserve and strengthen consumers' skin while respecting people and our planet are not satisfactory.The cosmetic industries must grasp the issue of skin health and aging holistically from the perspective of the skin interactome3 involving the relation- ships between genome, microbiome and exposome.
This also means taking into account the way in which environmental extrinsic factors modify the health of the skin during the day, in conjunction with the intrinsic factors among which our skin and intestinal microflora, fundamental building blocks 2 https:// www. fda.gov/ food/ cfsan- const ituent- updat es/ fda- repeal- color- addit ive- appro val- use- lead- aceta te- hair- dyes.3 In biology, an interactome is defined as the whole network of functional and physical interactions taking place between molecules within cells, tissues, organs and organisms.The exposome refers to the environmental exposures affecting the individuals.487 Mastering health: liberating beauty 1 3 of our biological ecosystem, have a major impact on our health (Khmaladze et al.2020).
The “self‑looking glass” revisited A silent revolution has set in over the past five years in all layers of society and in a wide variety of nations that have been hit hard by catastrophic political rhetoric regarding the negative impact humans have on the planet. The behavior of consumers with respect to their individual well-being has been put to the test.We have witnessed a real flourishing of multiple alternatives to the relationships of individuals to their bodies and to beauty companies who claim to provide the consumers with the serenity to which they aspire.Perception and dissemination of self‑image Online communities set current and future trends.The influence of social networks and consumer communities that interact online is considerable.The launch of the first mobile phone equipped with a front photographic lens by the Japanese company Kyocera in 1999 was a technological breakthrough with far-reaching consequences.
It opened the way to the surge of self-portraits (now referred to as selfies) on social networks and triggered an overwhelming craze for image transformation technologies. Augmented reality technologies have driven a cultural model of the "ultra-self".Digital beauty is a real revolu- tion that has become prominent in our "selfie-dependent" societies.Thus, Cooley's "self-looking glass" has given way to a one-person centered virtual world in which everyone can indulge their appearance fantasies and control their bio- chemical modifications.Thus, internet users significantly modified selfies, enabling those who do not accept the image the device sends them, to obtain an “artistic” smoothed image that deliver an unreal representation of themselves, supposedly helping their social integration.
Inner well‑being, source of beauty The current needs for cosmetics increasingly relate to claims relating to i) the environmental impact of cosmetic- producing industries, ii) the origin and composition of active products for cosmetic use, iii) the personal impact consumers expect from their responsible use of biologically active products that can provide a balance of their health and beauty resulting in deep well-being. The immense technological progress resulting from detailed knowledge of the human genome has created a functional intersection between genome, genetics and nutrition, resulting in con- sumers awareness in the considerable potential of personal- ized nutrition for individual health.At the same time of this global behavioral change, con - sumers want to strengthen and redefine their central posi- tioning in a commercial world that had hitherto been a "crea- tor of needs".
The concept of “interior beauty” enunciated in 1875 by SCHILLER, turned into a concept of “beauty from within” in which beauty is driven by wellness and spiritual health. According to this concept, the consumers become the manager of their physical appearance by controlling their own health (nutrigenomics) and physical appearances through their diet (nutricosmetics).Nutricosmetics in practice Ten years after its inception, the global nutricosmetics mar - ket is booming with an estimated value of $17 billion in 2023 (Market research report February 2021).China and Japan are leading countries in the field.Nutricosmetics aims to provide consumers, with answers to their desire to improve the convergence of well-being and the expression of their intrinsic beauty.Scientifically estab- lished causalities in areas relating to the effects of the envi- ronment, cellular aging and biochemical functional deficien- cies provide the foundations of nutricosmetics applications.According to D.
Masterson (2021) the flagships of the moment include Biotin and marine collagen, with a mixture derived from seaweed for the treatment of the hair; extracts of apple; nettle accompanied by Shatavari for the treatment of thinning hair root in women in the postpartum phase; lemon verbena extracts and rosemary with olive leaves and Japanese sophora to treat wrinkles and oxidative stress, col- lagen from the eggshell membrane, to help maintain the soft- ness and elasticity of the skin, and trans-resveratrol isolated from Japanese knotweed extract to strengthen the body's production of antioxidants. More recently, saponins which are major components of tomato seed extract, were reported to improve skin diseases and maintain skin elasticity (Izumi et al.2021).The discovery that tomato extract curbs the damaging effects of UVA and UVB rays on the skin has been a major breakthrough (Cooperstone et al.
2017) as it raised the pos- sibility that the mixtures of zinc oxide and titanium diox- ide commonly used as UV filters in sunscreens could be replaced with mixtures of natural phytonutrients. Studies carried out according to scientifically confirmed protocols (Groten et al.2019; Calniquer et al.2021; Baswan et al.2021) established that the photoprotective effects of the polynutrients contained in certain dietary supplements may result from their action on the UV-induced inflammatory processes and oxidative stress.Peptides derived from the hydrolysis of collagen, are used in multifunctional composi- tions containing zinc and vitamin C known for their well- being stimulating effects.This approach is one of the pillars 488 B.Perbal, S.Gabaron 1 3 of cosmetic nutrigenomics.
Although adding collagen to a daily diet has not proven to be efficient for everyone (Schiffer 2021 ), a recent systematic review established that inges - tion of collagen can reduce skin wrinkles and improve skin hydration and elasticity (De Miranda et al. 2021).Will the cosmetics of tomorrow be genetic?Over the recent years, a better knowledge of the relation- ships between nutrition and health (nutrigenomics), that are a source of well-being and beauty (nutricosmetics), com- bined to personalize diets adapted to each consumer (nutri- genetics), has led the way for cosmetics to take advantage of individual genetic data (cosmetogenetics) and gradually enter the innovation scene (Ramos-Lopez et al.2017; Perbal 2021).What could the personalized cosmetogenetics of the future look like?
To fully understand the principles on which cosmetogenetic approaches are based, it must be reminded that the program contained in our DNA (our genetic data) is called “geno- type” while the more or less visible characteristics result- ing from the expression of genetic data are making up the individual “phenotype”. A polymorphism occurring at the level of single nucleo- tides (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism or SNP) is respon- sible for the unique genetic identity and diversity of indi- viduals.As of April 10, 2018, the catalog of the European Bioinformatics Institute (NHGRI-EBI) listed 65,536 signifi- cant associations of unique SNPs with normal or pathologi- cal human phenotypic traits.
In a review of GWAS (genome-wide association stud- ies) performed on skin complex diseases Zhang (2012) had already reported the identification of a large number of susceptibility variants linked to 10 skin complex diseases including psoriasis, systemic lupus, vitiligo, leprosy, atopic dermatitis (AD), Male-pattern baldness, keloid (KD), and cutaneous nevi, to cite a few. The GWAS approach repre - sents unique tools for the development of techniques whose ultimate goals are, cosmetological or pharmacological treat- ments, making it possible to better manage the inner well- being on which individual beauty is based.Indeed, several SNPs are associated with rosacea, facial pigmentation, inflammatory skin reactions, atopic dermatitis, skin sensi- tivity to staphylococci, skin autofluorescence, or acute skin dryness, for example.
Recently, loss-of-function mutations of a gene encoding filagrin, a filament-associated protein binding keratin fibers in epithelial cells, were identified as the strongest known genetic risk factor in the heritability of Atopic dermatis (AD) (Løset et al. 2019).Detection of such markers in the DNA of beauty and make up consumers could help estab- lish personalized cosmetic treatments based on personalized diets provided that the disorders to be treated have a known dietary cause.It has been established for decades that the active ingre- dients used in pharmacology, dietetics or cosmetology have effects that are determined by the biological and genetic makeup of consumers.It is now widely accepted in preci- sion medicine4 that the concept of “one-size-fits-all” medi- cal treatments must be abandoned in favor of personalized ones.
Because the identification of SNPs is becoming much easier today than it was a few years ago, the cosmetogenet- ics consumers of tomorrow might be tailored to personal genomic SNP profiles. The evolution of cosmetic treatments that is now emerging is very similar to the early stages of precision medicine.Smart mirrors and predictive cosmetology The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms performing a virtual dermatological consultation from a photographic self-portrait (selfie), was an important step in the fields of augmented reality (AR) applied to beauty.During the natural process of skin aging, a decrease in the cell production of collagen and elastin appears between the ages of 25 and 30.The skin becomes less firm and less smooth, the elastic fibers of the dermis break and give rise to fine lines, more numerous and less deep than wrinkles, mainly at the level of the lower eyelids and the perioral region.One must distinguish "expression" wrin- kles from “aging” wrinkles.
While the former are linked to the repeated contractions of the fascial muscles (trans- verse wrinkles of the forehead, inter-eyebrow lines also called lion's lines, and crow's feet wrinkles of the peri - orbital regions), the latter result from sagging skin that develops with age. One can recognize the wrinkles at the corners of the mouth (bitterness lines), others that extend from the wings of the nose to the corners of the mouth (nasolabial fold lines), the wrinkles of the neck forming horizontal cords or vertical folds.Wrinkles widen with age and become deeper.Enlarged pores and loss of luster of the skin are also known signs of aging.The aging of skin is determined in large parts by the genetic heritage of indi- viduals but also their lifestyles.Thus, on the one hand, oily skins wrinkle less quickly, and on the other hand smoking considerably accelerates aging and skin loosening.
Fine lines and wrinkles, pigment spots and pore dilation, all 4 The foundations of precision medicine were laid in the United States under the impulse of President Barak Obama, after the com- plete sequencing of the human genome. 489 Mastering health: liberating beauty 1 3 usually considered as signs of skin aging, are generally sought by dermatologists.The recent development of an interactive mirror integrat- ing personal physical characteristics transmitted by vari- ous connected objects pushed the limits of a new creative cosmetology.The embedded application that allows monitoring of body mass index and the quality of the skin makes it possible to suggest personalized medical actions as for example, when a skin health problem, such as the modification or appear - ance of a new mole, is detected.
Although the computer applications that are currently associated with the use of "smart" mirrors are intended only for a qualitative screening of skin abnormalities, they paved the way for an analysis of individual phenotypic characteristics. Numeric treatments of phenotypic traits performed with this type of interactive mir - ror might lead to predictive treatments based on the user's individual genetic heritage.As such they could provide a unique ground for a personalized non-intrusive identification of genetic markers responsible for phenotypic traits analyzed by the mirror.Considering the size of a human genome size of about 180 Gigabytes (Robison 2014), downloading the full content of individual genomic data to portable mirrors in a digital form or to multifunction mobile phones ("smartphones") is quite possible, as previously suggested for DTC genetics (Perbal 2014).
However, the collection of these data could allow one to perform specific and personal searches for genetic markers of interest, by adapted AI systems. Finally, given the recent evolution in the fields of correc- tive genetics it is possible to forecast that, in the coming dec- ades, the presence of SNPs associated with the expression of phenotypic traits considered alarming by the consumer and their medical councilor, might be corrected by the precise genomic modifications, which are booming today (Perbal 2021).Science fiction?Who would have thought that the dis- covery of CRISPR-Cas9 would lead less than ten years later to precise editing of the genome, of many different living species, therefore opening the path to human therapies of many kinds?The newly revealed potentialities of human genetic engi- neering, has put forth the weaknesses and inefficiencies of outdated legal and normative texts, because of their inad- equacy to societal evolution.
It is necessary, today, to remove any passionate feeling from the current discussions to tem- per emotional debates by redefining, as soon as possible, the legal status of genetic data and the information that their treatment can deliver. Should the replacement of genomic sequences by new genetic material become a standard proce- dure in the coming decade, adapted legal regulations regard- ing the manipulation of personal health data will be strongly required to avoid misuse of the individual genetic heritage.Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to Dr.Herman Yeger for his critical review of the manuscript and suggestions.Thanks are also due to Annick Perbal for her support.Declarations Conflict of interest The authors declared that there is no conflict of interest.References Baswan SM, Klosner AE, Weir C, Salter-Venzon D, Gellenbeck KW, Leverett J, Krutmann J (2021) Role of ingestible carotenoids in skin protection: a review of clinical evidence.
