Macroscopic, histopathological examinations, and biomarkers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α) and interlukin- 1β (IL-1β), myeloperoxidase (MPO), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and ferric reduced ability of plasma (FRAP) were determined in the colon. RESULTS: The combination therapy exhibited a signif - icant beneficial effect in alleviation of colitis compared to controls.Overall changes in reduction of TNF- α (114.66 ± 18.26 vs 171.78 ± 9.48 pg/mg protein, P < 0.05), IL-1 β (24.9 ± 1.07 vs 33.06 ± 2.16 pg/mg protein, P < 0.05), TBARS (0.2 ± 0.03 vs 0.49 ± 0.04 μg/mg protein, P < 0.01), MPO (15.32 ± 0.4 vs 27.24 ± 3.84 U/mg protein, P < 0.05), and elevation of FRAP (23.46 ± 1.2 vs 15.02 ± 2.37 μmol/L, P < 0.05) support the preference of the combination therapy in comparison to controls.
Although the monotherapies were also effective in improvement of colitis markers, the combination therapy was much better in improve - ment of colon oxidative stress markers including FRAP, TBARS, and MPO. CONCLUSION: The present combination is a suitable mixture in control of experimental colitis and should be trialed in the clinical setting.© 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.All rights reserved.Key words: Butyrate; L-carnitine; Colitis; Inflammatory bowel disease; Oxidative stress; Lactobacillus casei ; Probiotic Core tip: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is among the common diseases in the world that have no abso - lute cure yet.Although cortico steroids, immunosup -ORIGINAL ARTICLE pressants, and aminosalicylates are conventionally used in management of IBD, their side effects reduce patients’ compliance.
In this paper, we have shown that the combination of butyrate, Lactobacillus casei , and, L-carnitine reduces the amount of oxidative stress within the colon and provides significant anti-inflamma - tory effects. Optimistically, the proposed combination is from components with no serious side effects and is more economical to manufacture.Moeinian M, Ghasemi-Niri SF, Mozaffari S, Abdolghaffari AH, Baeeri M, Navaea-Nigjeh M, Abdollahi M.Beneficial effect of butyrate, Lactobacillus casei and L-carnitine combination in preference to each in experimental colitis.World J Gastroenterol 2014; 20(31): 10876-10885 Available from: URL: http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/full/v20/i31/ 10876 .htm DOI: http:// dx.doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v20.i31.10876 INTRODUCTION Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease, has an increasing in - cidence and can be debilitating in the affected patients.
Patients with IBD usually suffer from bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and also extra-gastrointestinal manifes - tations such as uveitis, arthritis, skin lesions, and hepa - tobiliary disease[1-3]. Although the definite etiology of IBD remains debatable, the role of immune dysfunction, particularly over-activity of inflammatory factors includ - ing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α) and interlukin- 1β (IL-1β), and oxidants such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) has been defined along with other factors such as environment, genetics, and intestinal microbes[4,5].Current protocol of IBD treatment consists of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) derivatives, immuno-suppressive agents, corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies, and some other complementary agents such as herbal medicines.However, increasing complications of conventional medications besides de - creased patients compliance have led scientists to focus on the safety alongside efficacy[6-9].
Butyrate, a type of short chain fatty acid, is produced naturally by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers as a fuel in the colon. Previous reports emphasized its protective ability against oxidative stress and depletion of inflammatory markers including TNF- α and IL-1 β through interfering with Ikappa B kinase (IKK) and resulting in down-regulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) which is responsible for generation of pro- inflammatory cytokines[10-13].In addition, Lactobacillus casei (L.casei ) as a probiotic, exhibits modulatory effects on immune response and oxidative stress via IKK or pro - duction of anti-oxidant enzymes such as superoxide dis - mutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT).Several studies sug - gest that manipulation of normal flora content may have beneficial effects in IBD[14-16].
L-carnitine ( β hydroxyl- γ trimethyl amino butyrate) plays a significant role in fatty acid β-oxidation, glucose metabolism and general energy control in all types of cells including colonocytes. Pro - duction of SOD and inhibition of glutathione (GSH) reduction confirm its anti-oxidant feature and also pro - tective effects against inflammation[17-20].In summary, recent data revealed that butyrate, L-carnitine, and L.casei have noticeable beneficial potential in experimental IBD models alone or in combination with other medi - cines[21-24].Therefore, in the present study we evaluated the synergism effect of the combination of these three agents by assessment of inflammatory indicators and pathological marke rs.

(Tehran, Iran) and rat-specific TNF- α and IL-1β Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELI - SA) kits from (BenderMed Systems GmbH, Austria) were used in this study. Animals In this study, male Wistar rats weighing 180-200 g were selected according to regulations of the ethical committee of TUMS approved with code number of 91-03-33-19079.Animals were housed separately in standard polypropylene cages with a wire mesh top, kept under standard conditions including temperature (23 ± 1 ℃), relative humidity (55% ± 10%), and 12/12 h light/dark cycle, and fed a standard pellet diet and water ad libitum.Experimental design Animals were divided into seven groups, with seven rats in each group.Colitis was induced by injection of TNBS rec - tally in all groups except the sham group, which received normal saline.
Groups receiving TNBS were divided into control (as an untreated group), positive control (received 1 mg/kg dexamethasone dissolved in water), and treat - ment groups containing butyrate (1 mL of 0.5% in which 0.5 g butyrate was dissol ved in 100 mL PBS), L-carnitine (500 mg/kg in 1 mL), L. casei (1 mL of whey culture con - tains 108 Cfu L.casei ), and combination (0.5 mL butyrate, Moeinian M et al.A new combination therapy for IBD 10877 August 21, 2014 |Volume 20 |Issue 31 | WJG|www.wjgnet.com 0.5 mL L-carnitine, and 1 mL L.casei ).Whey culture (10% w/v , 10 g whey powder in 100 mL distilled water) was prepared at 121 ℃ for 20 min.Then, L.casei was added to it and incubated at 37 ℃ for 48 h.The day TNBS was administered was assigned as the first day and all treatments started from the same day.During a 10-d treatment course, the groups were treated by gavage.Induction of colitis Prior to induction of colitis, rats were fasted for 36 h.
They were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium[25]. Then, 0.3 mL of a mix - ture, comprising 6 volumes of 5% TNBS plus 4 volumes of 99% ethanol, was instilled through the anus using a rubber cannula (8 cm long) into rats situated on their right side, and then the rats were held in a prone Tren - delenburg position to stop the anal leakage of TNBS[26].Sample preparation On treatment day 11, animals were sacrificed and colonic tissues were immediately separated.Isolated segments were rinsed with normal saline and then placed in an ice bath throughout the procedure.Colonic tissue was divid - ed into two pieces.The first piece was weighed and kept in 10 mL of formalin 10%, as a fixator for the purpose of histopathological evaluation.The second piece was weighed and homogenized in 10 volumes of ice cold po - tassium phosphate buffer (50 mmol, pH = 7.4) and then stored at -20 ℃ for 24 h.
The sample was then sonicated and centrifuged for 30 min at 3500 g, and the supernatant was transferred to a microtube. Then, the sample was kept at -80 ℃ until biomarker analyses.Macroscopic and microscopic assessments The fol lowing macroscopic scoring system was used to evaluate the severity of colonic damage: 0 - normal ap - pearance with no damage; 1 - localized hyperemia with - out ulcer; 2 - localized hyperemia with an ulcer; 3 - a lin - ear ulcer with inflammation at one site; 4 - two or more ulcers with damage extending 1-2 cm along the length of the colon; and 5 to 8 - damage extending more than 2 cm along the length of the colon and the score was increased by 1 for each increased cm of involvement.The microscopic scoring was done by an observer who was blinded to the treated groups.
Microscopic scores were determined as follows: 0 - no damage; 1 - focal epithelial edema and necrosis; 2 - disperse swelling and necrosis of the villi; 3 - necrosis with neutrophil in - filtration in the submucosa; and 4 - widespread necrosis with massive neutrophil infiltration and hemorrhage. Myeloperoxidase activity assessment 2.9 mL of 50 mmol/L phosphate buffer containing 0.167 mg/mL O-dianisidine hydrochloride and 0.0005% H 2O2 was blended with 0.1 mL of the supernatant.The absor - bance was measured for 3 min at 460 nm spectrophoto - metrically (Shimadzu 160A UV-VIS spectrophotometer) and expressed as unit per mg protein of colon tissue.One unit is equal to the change in absorbance per min at room temperature in the final reaction[27].
Lipid peroxidation assessment Lipid peroxides as the end products of poly unsaturated fatty acid peroxidation are aldehydes that react with TBA named TBA reactive substance (TBARS) and form a complex which is detected at 532 nm by a double beam spectrophotometer. Concentration of TBARS is record - ed as μg/mg protein[28].Ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assessment Ferric-tripyridyltriazine (Fe3+-TPTZ) complex is reduced to bluish ferrous-tripyridyltriazine (Fe2+-TPTZ) with ab - sorption at 593 nm.Values are reported as mmol/L fer - ric ions reduced to ferrous per mg protein.Details have been described previously[29].IL-1β and TNF-α assessment Using ELISA, the quantities of IL-1 β and TNF- α (pg/ mg protein of tissue) were measured.Amounts of blue complex resulting from conjugation of chromogenic sub - stance with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidise (Streptav - idin-HPR) were calculated at both 450 nm (primary wave length) and 620 nm (reference wave length).
Details have been described previously[30]. Total protein assessment Total protein was measured by the Bradford method us - ing BSA as the standard and data are expressed as mg/ mL of homogenized tissue at 540 nm[31].Statistical analysis One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post- hoc tests was used for multiple comparisons of out - comes, and data are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.StatsDirect version 3.0.107 was used for sta - tistical analyses.
RESULTS Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of histological impairment As shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, histopathological ex - amination of the control group which received TNBS showed severe ulcer, diffused necrosis, edema, crypt de - struction, and mucosal/submucosal polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte infiltration, which were significantly dif - ferent ( P < 0.001) from the sham group that had normal histology and a regular mucosal layer with intact epithelial surface. In the L-carnitine group, crypt destruction and abscess, submucosal inflammation and low PMN infiltra - tion were observed.In the butyrate group, mild infiltra - tion, crypt destruction, edema, and disintegration of crypts were locally observed in some areas.Histopatho - logical parameters in the L.casei group were most similar 10878 August 21, 2014 |Volume 20 |Issue 31 | WJG|www.wjgnet.comMoeinian M et al.
A new combination therapy for IBD flamed tissues in the control group in comparison to the sham group ( P < 0.01). The group of animals receiving monotherapies with butyrate, L-carnitine, and L.casei showed a reduction of MPO activity by 40.71%, 39.86%, and 38.95%, respectively, in comparison with controls ( P < 0.05).Dexamethasone decreased MPO by 60.82% in comparison with control group ( P < 0.01).Also, in the combination group, there was a significant reduction in MPO activity by 43.75% in comparison with the control group ( P < 0.05).In the combination, butyrate, and L.casei groups, MPO increased by 17.07%, 20.11%, and 20.96%, respectively, in comparison with the dexametha - sone group ( P < 0.05).MPO increased by 21.87% in the L-carnitine group compared with the dexamethasone group ( P < 0.01).The combination group showed a more reduction of MPO by 4.80% than the L-carnitine group ( P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference between to those in the butyrate group.
A significant reduction in microscopic scores was observed in each treatment group in terms of histological symptoms such as inflam - mation and/or diffuses necrosis hemorrhage and severe crypt destruction in comparison with the control group (P < 0.001). In the combination group, crypt abscess and mild inflammation of the submucosa with no PMN infiltration were observed.Although the histological scores decreased in the combination group (Table 1) and histopathological symptoms including PMN infiltration and crypt destruction were more vivid in comparison with monotherapy groups, there was no significant differ - ence between the combination group and monotherapy groups.Myeloperoxidase activity Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was increased in in - 10879 August 21, 2014 |Volume 20 |Issue 31 | WJG|www.wjgnet.com AB C D EGF H IJ K Figure 1 Histological images of colon tissues from control and experimental groups.
Microscopic evaluation of Control group showed transmural inflammation and/or diffuse necrosis hemorrhage (A) and severe crypt destruction (B). In histological examination of Dexa group, minimal mucosal inflammation was observed (C).In L.casei and Butyrate groups, mild infiltration (D, G) and crypt destruction (E, F) were seen.In L-carnitine group, crypt formation (H), submucosa inflammation and low PMN infiltration (I) were observed.In Combination group, crypt abscess (J) and normal submucosa (K) were evident.Control Dexa L.casei Butyrate L-carnitine CombinationMoeinian M et al.A new combination therapy for IBD combination therapy and monotherapies with L.casei and butyrate (Figure 2).TNF-α level There was an increase in TNF- α level in controls com - pared to the sham group ( P < 0.001).In the dexametha - sone group, TNF- α was reduced by 54.54% compared with the control group ( P < 0.001).
TNF- α level de - creased in the combination, butyrate, and L-carnitine groups by 33.25%, 28.07%, and 19.90%, respectively, in comparison with the control group ( P < 0.05). Dexa - methason was more effective in reduction of TNF- α than monotherapies with butyrate by 26.46% ( P < 0.05), L-carnitine by 34.63% and L.casei groups by 46.32% ( P < 0.01).There was no notable difference when comparing combination therapy with single therapies (Figure 3).IL-1β level The control group showed a notable elevation in IL-1 β in comparison with the sham group ( P < 0.001).In the dexamethasone, combination, L-carnitine, and L.casei groups, IL-1 β diminished by 24.98%, 24.68%, 24.13%, and 24.22%, respectively, in comparison with the control group ( P < 0.05).There was no significant change in the combination group when compared to monotherapies with butyrate, L-carnitine, and L.casei (Figure 4).

The combination group showed a more decrease in TBARS than the butyrate and L. casei groups by 20.40% and 20.40%, respectively ( P < 0.05).TBARS changed 32.65% in the L-carnitine group, which was significantly lower than that in the combination group (59.18%, P < 0.01) (Figure 6).DISCUSSION Regard ing overall results, the present study demonstrated the priority of combination of butyrate, L.casei and L-carnitine in ameliorating the severity of colitis in com - parison to monotherapies.Macroscopic features includ - ing appearance of isolated tissue and histopathological scores such as presence of edema, necrosis, neutrophil infiltration, and biomarkers including TNF- α, IL-1β, MPO, TBARS, and anti-oxidant power confirmed the beneficial effect of the combination treatment in com - parison to controls.Specifically, the combination therapy was much better in reducing colon oxidative stress mark - ers including FRAP , TBARS, and MPO.
Although there are several reports on the positive effects of these three agents in inflammation or oxida - tive stress explained through various mechanisms[13,14,17], the current study based on an original hypothesis[11] is the first one that confirms synergism between butyrate, L. casei and L-carnitine in the immune-based model of colitis.TNBS-induced colitis is believed a preferential model since the colon’s barrier is broken by ethanol and 10881 August 21, 2014 |Volume 20 |Issue 31 | WJG|www.wjgnet.com40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0IL-1β (pg/mg protein)b b,cb,ca b,c ShamControlDexa CombinationButyrateL-carnitineL.caseib,c Figure 4 Interlukin-1 β level in the colon.Values are mean ± SEM.Sig - nificantly different from sham group at aP < 0.05; Significantly different from sham group at bP < 0.01; Significantly different from sham group at bP < 0.001; Significantly different from control group at cP < 0.05; Significantly different from control group at dP < 0.01.

A new combination therapy for IBD then dela yed-response hypersensitivity reaction by TNBS occurs like that of human IBD[20,32-34].This similarity is confirmed by the same pattern of changes in examined cytokines between experimental studies and those report - ed in humans such as accumulation of MPO, TNF- α, IL-1β, ROS, and RNS[4,26,35-38].Specifically, MPO, a hemo enzyme, is released dramatically from neutrophils in or - der to eradicate pathogens.It facilitates production of cytotoxic agents like hypochlorite acid (HOCl), the stimu - lator of NF- κB that is able to induce other inflammatory factors via H2O2[39,40].Results indicate that MPO as a neu - trophil infiltration indicator and TBARS as an indicator of lipid peroxidation are markedly up-regulated in colon tissues while these are restored by combination therapy.This is most likely due to their radical scavenging proper - ties[3].
As shown schematically in Figure 7, butyrate is able to lessen oxidants through suppressing IKK, which is responsible for dissociation of NF- κB from IKB- α, and then free-NF- κB fortifies oxidants via overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase gene[4]. In addition, probiotics have the same effect either directly by produc - tion of SOD and CAT against oxidants or blocking IKK indirectly[15,16].Likewise, L-carnitine modifies activity of oxidative stress by elevation of SOD and prevention of decrease in GSH content[17-20], and eventually, the combi - nation treatment exerts well against oxidants with higher efficacy related to synergism of th ese three agents.In turn, observed changes in the FRAP test support that idea.Regarding the inflammation, TNF- α, a pro-inflam - matory cytokine, is produced mainly by macrophages and activated T-lymphocytes.It is an active component in apoptosis, stimulation of IL-1 β secretion, and inflamma - tion, in which re-induction of IKK occurs.
This process is mediated through the cascade consisting of binding to TNF receptor (TNF-R) accompanied with dissociation of silencer of death domains from TNF-R type1-asso - ciated death domain. Further attachment of TRADD to death domain leads to the activation of the ribosome inactivating protein and TNF-R associated factor 2 which trigger IKK[11,13,41].In addition, IL-1 β has a crucial role in inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, and apopto - sis, which is secreted from macrophages, neutrophils, en - dothelial, and epithelial cells[42].Our results indicate that in contrast to the control group, abundant formation of IL-1β and TNF- α was restricted in the treatment groups.This is explained by the drop in inflammation either through blocking IKK to activate NF- κB or inability to overexpress inflammatory cytokines.
However, obvious differences are evident between monotherapy groups and the combination group in amelioration of inflammation that originates from synergistic effects in the combination therapy. In summary, a high level of anti-oxidative stress abil - ity, anti-inflammation feature and positive interactions amplify the effects of the combination therapy by over - expression of sodium-coupled mono carboxylate trans - 10882 August 21, 2014 |Volume 20 |Issue 31 | WJG|www.wjgnet.comButyrateActivation of RIP and TRAF2 Attachment of death domain to TRADD Dissociation of SODD from TRADD Binding to TNF-R TNFα iNOS andNO (A type of RNS) Transcription of in nucleusαβ IKK IKBIKB αα κ N F Bκ N F B SODL-carnitine Probiotics SOD and CAT Figure 7 Effects of butyrate, L-carnitine, and probiotics on Ikappa B kinase.Adopted from authors’s previous Open Access publication (Moeinian et al.Syner - gistic effect of probiotics, butyrate and L-carnitine in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

No toxicity following administration of each of them individually or in combination observed in this study certifies the safety of this mixture. Literature shows no severe complications in ordinary patients who take ordinary doses of L.casei or L-carnitine[48-50].Howev - er, more investigations are required to clarify the mixture’ s safety in the clinical setting.According to the results, the combination of these three agents is more effective than each alone in attenuation of the inflammatory proces s.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Malihe Moeinian from Dental School of Queen Mary, University of London for her help with editing the article.COMMENTS Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is divided into two major and idiopathic con - ditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn′s disease.Current choice in control of IBD is administration of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants that are associated with side effects.
Due to side effects of current conventional therapies, scientists have tried to discover more potent and safer alternatives. The authors intended to demonstrate that the combination of butyrate, L-carni - tine, and L.casei may be an effective and safe mixture in amelioration of colitis.Research frontiers Several studies focused on the major role of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- κB) signaling which results in overproduction of inflammatory mediators and oxi - dants in the progress of inflammation.In this study, the authors evaluated the capacity of the combination therapy in healing the colitis and improvement of inflammatory cytokines.Innovations and breakthroughs The present study indicated that the combination therapy is able to heal colitis and down-regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines.Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway either by suppression of IKK or production of enzymes against free radicals is the main mechanism of action of this mixture.
Applications Safety and effectiveness besides positive interactions of these three agents confirm that this combination can be more helpful in healing IBD and improving the patients’ quality of life. Peer review The main hypothesis of the paper for management of IBD is valuable.REFERENCES 1 Sartor RB .Mechanisms of disease: pathogenesis of Crohn’ s disease and ulcerative colitis.Nat Clin Pract Gastroenterol Hepatol 2006; 3: 390-407 [PMID: 16819502 DOI: 10.1038/ncp - gasthep0528] 2 Oz HS , Ebersole JL.Application of prodrugs to inflamma - tory diseases of the gut.Molecules 2008; 13: 452-474 [PMID: 18305431 DOI: 10.3390/molecules13020452] 3 Mozaffari S , Nikfar S, Abdolghaffari AH, Abdollahi M.New biologic therapeutics for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s dis - ease.Expert Opin Biol Ther 2014; 14: 583-600 [PMID: 24502344] 4 Rezaie A , Parker RD, A bdollahi M.Oxidative stress and patho -genesis of inflammatory bowel disease: an epiphenomenon or the cause?
