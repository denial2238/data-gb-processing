A study was conducted to evalu- ate the in ﬂuence of dietary VD or VE on performance, gut health, immune response, and oxidative status oflaying hens at peak production. Laying hens (23 wk-of-age, n = 225) were randomly allocated into 5 treatmentgroups (n = 9 hens/replicate) with 5 replicate groupseach: 1) unchallenged control ( UC), 2) pair-fed control (PF), 3) challenged control ( CC), 4) challenged control top-dressed with 5,000 IU of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3(VD) per kg of diet, and 5) challenged controltop-dressed with 100 IU of DL- a-tocopherol ( VE).At 25 wk-of-age, hens grouped in CC, VD, and VE were chal-lenged with mixed Eimeria spp.to induce coccidiosis.VD or VE supplemented hens did not impact bird bodyweight; however, egg production increased by 10.36%and 13.77%, respectively ( P<0.0001).Furthermore, the gut health of the hens was improved with either VD or VE supplementation, as indicated by lowered gut perme- ability and intestinal lesion scores ( P<0.05).
VE signi ﬁ- cantly reduced the heterophil count ( P=0 . 0 4 9 0 ) alongside numerically increasing the peripheral CD4+and CD8+ T cells and monocyte counts ( P>0.05).Both VD or VE increased the TAC at 14 DPI compared to UC(P<0.05).Preliminary ﬁndings suggest that dietary VD or VE supplementation has the potential to improve gut health, modulate the immune response, and increase egg production in coccidiosis-infected laying hens.Key words: 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3, vitamin E, coccidiosis, gut health, laying hen 2024 Poultry Science 103:104033 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2024.104033 INTRODUCTION Avian coccidiosis is one of the most predominant dis- eases in poultry production, with a signi ﬁcant economic loss of more than 15 billion dollars to the poultry indus-try ( Blake et al., 2020 ).
Seven known Eimeria species have been identi ﬁed in chickens, and Eimeria acervu- lina, Eimeria maxima, andEimeria tenella are the most pathogenic and predominant species in poultry produc- tion ( Conway and McKenzie, 2007 ;McMullin, 2020 ). Although these protozoa produce separate and distinc-tive lesions at different parts of the digestive tract, ingeneral, these protozoa multiply in the gastrointestinaltract, damaging the gut ( Conway and McKenzie, 2007 ; McMullin, 2020 ).These damage the intestinal epithelial cells, mucosa, and submucosa; as a result, nutrient diges-tion and absorption are interrupted, and in ﬂammation and oxidative stress are increased, ultimately affectingthe performance of birds ( Perez-Carbajal et al., 2010 ; Choi et al., 2023a ;Liu et al., 2023 ;Sharma et al., 2024a ; b).
Several strategies have been employed by the poultry industry to control coccidiosis on farms, such as strict biosecurity, vaccination, anticoccidial drugs, bioshuttleor rotational programs ( Mohamed Hafez, 2008 ;Chap- man et al., 2010 ;Peek and Landman, 2011 ). Although strict biosecurity and vaccination programs have beenable to control coccidiosis outbreaks, the lack of cross-immunity among different species and the risk of diseaseoutbreaks are still the major concerns ( Mohamed Hafez, 2008;Peek and Landman, 2011 ).Currently, the use of anticoccidial drugs to control coccidiosis is now limiteddue to the emergence of resistance ( Mohamed Hafez, /C2112024 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.This is an open access article under the CCBY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/ 4.0/).Received January 22, 2024.Accepted June 23, 2024.

Consumer preference and the ban on antimicrobials in animal production haveprompted the poultry industry to look for alternativesto support vaccination and control coccidiosis inchickens.Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin and is synthesized in the body when exposed to sunlight.In the liver, vita- min D is then converted to the major circulating form25-hydroxyvitamin D 3[25(OH)D 3](Pike and Christa- kos, 2017 ;Fakhoury et al., 2020 ).Subsequently, 25(OH) D3is converted into its active form, 1,25-dihydroxy vita- min D [ 1,25(OH) 2D3] in the kidney by enzyme 25- hydroxyvitamin D-1 a-hydroxylase.
The conversion of 25(OH)D 3to 1,25(OH) 2D3is the major limiting step and is tightly regulated by endocrine factors that are elaborated in response to changes in plasma calciumand/or phosphorus ( Pike and Christakos, 2017 ; Fakhoury et al., 2020 ;Fatemi et al., 2024 ). Since 1,25 (OH) 2D3is tightly regulated in the body with a shorter half-life, 25(OH)D 3can be used as a dietary alternative in poultry.25-hydroxyvitamin D 3has a signi ﬁcant role in several biological functions in chickens, such as cal- cium and phosphorus absorption and maintaining homeostasis, bone mineralization, and muscle develop-ment ( Fatemi et al., 2021 ,2022,2024).Furthermore, it has been observed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 a- hydroxylase is not only found in the kidney but also inmacrophages along with the vitamin D receptor, thushaving the potential to modulate immune functions(Morris and Selvaraj, 2014 ;Shanmugasundaram et al., 2019;Fakhoury et al., 2020 ).
The inclusion of 25(OH)D 3 in chickens has been shown to increase nitric oxide pro- duction, stimulate the activity of innate immune cells,modulate adaptive immunity, production of antimicro-bial proteins, and in ﬂammatory cytokines, as well as maintain tight junction ( Morris and Selvaraj, 2014 ; Morris et al., 2015 ;Shanmugasundaram et al., 2019 ; Fakhoury et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, 25(OH)D 3has a major role in follicular development and oocyte matura- tion by increasing the expression of VDR in oocytes(Grzesiak, 2020 ;Xu et al., 2021 ) and increasing egg pro- duction in laying hens ( Chen et al., 2020 ;Wang et al., 2023).Similar to vitamin D, vitamin E is a fat-soluble vita- min with a strong immunomodulatory and antioxidantcapacity ( Allen and Fetterer, 2002 ;Konjufca et al., 2004;Fu et al., 2022 ).After ingestion, vitamin E is absorbed and incorporated into the cellular membraneand protects it against the free radical oxidative pro-cesses ( Tappel, 1972 ;Gao et al., 2010 ).
Furthermore, vitamin E strengthens a body ’s antioxidant defense by enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, includ-ing total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase,glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione ( Zhu et al., 2022 ;Fu et al., 2022 ). It has been observed that vitamin E enhances immune function by increasing theproduction of the cytokine interferon- g, which isproduced by activated T cells, and boosting the humoral immune response of broilers challenged with Eimeria (Colnago et al., 1984 ;Leshchinsky and Klasing, 2001 ; Allen and Fetterer, 2002 ;d a Silva et al., 2009 ;Perez- Carbajal et al., 2010 ).Furthermore, vitamin E has been shown to enhance the phagocytic activity of the macro-phages in chickens against pathogens ( Konjufca et al., 2004).
In the case of the egg layers, vitamin E inclusion has increased egg production by enhancing follicular development by increasing the concentration of repro- ductive hormones such as follicle-stimulating hormone,luteinizing hormone, estrogens, and progesterone ( Fu et al., 2022 ). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of vitamin D3 [25(OH)D 3] or vitamin E (DL- a-tocopherol acetate) on performance, gut health, immune response, and antioxidant status of the layinghens infected with coccidiosis.MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Design All the animal experiment procedures used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Georgia (A202112-012).
A total of 225 Hy-Line W-36 laying hens at 23wk-of-age were randomly allocated into one of the ﬁve treatment groups with 5 replicates each (n = 9 hens/rep-licate): 1) unchallenged control ( UC), 2) pair-fed con- trol (PF), 3) challenged control ( CC), 4) challenged control top-dressed with 5,000 IU of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3(VD) per kg of diet, and (v) challenged control top- dressed with 100 IU of DL- a-tocopherol ( VE). The corn and soy-based diet was formulated to meet or exceed thenutritional requirement of laying hens at peak produc-tion, as shown in Table 1 .The basal diet was top dressed with either 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol or DL- a-tocoph- erol acetate (VWR International, Radnor, PA) at theabovementioned rate to prepare the diets for VD or VE groups, respectively.
Laying hens were allowed to adapt to the experimental diets for 2 wk, and at 25 wk of age,hens grouped in CC, VD, and VE were challenged with12,500 sporulated oocysts of Eimeria maxima and 12,500 sporulated oocysts of Eimeria tenella and 62,500 oocysts of Eimeria acervulina solution per mL to induce coccidiosis ( Teng et al, 2020 ;Sharma et al., 2024b ). Lay- ing hens grouped in UC and PF were inoculated with 1 mL of distilled water to mimic the challenge.Laying hens grouped in UC, CC, VD, and VE had unlimitedaccess to water; however, hens grouped in PF were fedthe exact amount of feed consumed by CC from 0 to 14d postinoculation ( DPI).Laying Hen Performance Laying hen production performance, including body weight ( BW), hen day egg production ( HDEP ), feed intake ( ADFI ), and feed conversion ratio ( FCR ) of the laying hens, were measured every week before the Eime- riachallenge.Post Eimeria challenge, HDEP, and2 SHARMA ET AL.
ADFI were calculated daily, whereas BW was measured on 6, 14, and 21 DPI. Gastrointestinal Permeability, Lesion Score, Oocyst Counts and Intestinal Morphology At 5 DPI, one laying hen per replicate was inoculated with 2.2mg/mL of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d ; Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO) to measure gastrointestinal permeability.Brie ﬂy, blood was col- lected 2h postinoculation, and the concentration of FITC-d in the serum was measured using a spectropho-tometer at 485/525 nm (Spectramax M5, MolecularDevices, San Jose, CA).The intestinal lesion scoring forE.acervulina, E.maxima , and E.tenella was done at the duodenum, 10cm above and below the Meckel ’s diverticulum, and ceca, respectively, following the proce-dure outlined by Johnson and Reid (1970) andTeng et al.(2020) .Fecal oocyst counts for E.acervulina, E.max- ima, and E.tenella were performed following theprocedure outlined by Goo et al.(2023) .
Brie ﬂy, feces was allowed to build in the manure belt from 5 to 8 DPI. The feces were mixed properly within the replicatecages, and samples were collected on the 8 DPI.Approx-imately, 5 g of the collected samples was mixed in 35 mLof tap water and left to soften for 48 h at room tempera-ture.Afterward, the sample was vortexed and diluted ina saturated saltwater solution at a 1:11 ratio.Then, 650mL of the diluted sample solution was added to a McMaster counting chamber (Vetlab Supply, Palmetto Bay, FL) for oocyst enumeration.The E.maxima, E.tenella, and E.acervulina oocysts were identi ﬁed under a microscope based on their size and morphology.Theoocyst counts per gram of feces were expressed as log 10.At 6, 14, and 21 DPI, a 2 to 3 cm section of the duode-num, jejunum, and ileum was excised from the sampledhens and ﬁxed in 10% formalin.The ﬁxed samples were then embedded in paraf ﬁn blocks, sectioned into 4 mm slices, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Villusheight ( VH), crypt depth ( CD), and villus height (VH) to crypt depth ( CD) ratio ( VH:CD ) were mea- sured ( Sharma et al., 2024b ). RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR At 6, 14, and 21, DPI, jejunum, and cecal tonsil sam- ples were collected from sampled hens for qRT-PCR.Brieﬂy, samples were homogenized using a bead beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK), and RNA wasextracted using the QIAzol reagent (Qiagen, Valencia,CA).The quantity and quality of the extracted RNAwere accessed using a nanodrop eight spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA) ( Adhikari et al., 2019 ).The extracted RNA was normalized to 2mg/mL for each sample and reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a high-capacity cDNA conversion kit(Applied BioSystems, Life Technologies, Foster City,CA).
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in duplicatereactions, including nuclease-free water, forward andreverse primers, cDNA, and SYBR Green, using StepO- nePlus RT-PCR (Applied BioSystems, Life Technolo- gies, Carlsbad, CA). The relative mRNA expressiondata were generated using the 2 -DDCtmethod by normal- izing the expression of the target genes to a housekeep-ing gene, b-actin, and the values were reported as fold changes in the expression of the target genes to that ofcontrol ( Sharma et al., 2024a, b ).The expression of nutrient transporter and tight junction integrity genes were measured using jejunum, whereas in ﬂammatory cytokines were measured using the cecal tonsils.Theprimer sequences used in this experiment are listed inTable 2 .Chicken Peripheral Blood Leukocyte Enrichment One laying hen per replicate was arbitrarily selected for sampling, and approximately 10 mL of peripheral whole blood was collected on 14 dpi from the brachialTable 1.

8 to 10 microscopic ﬁelds using a digital counter by an avian immunologist (RMG) who was blinded to the bird treatments. The results were reported as % of 100 leuko-cytes counted.Oxidative Status The oxidative status of the laying hens following the Eimeria challenge was evaluated at 6, 14, and 21 DPI.The concentrations of malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) in the liver and total anti- oxidant capacity in serum ( TAC ) were used as indica- tors of oxidative status and measured following the procedure outlined by Sharma et al.(2022) .Statistical Analysis Data thus collected for growth performance, gastroin- testinal permeability, lesion score, oocyst counts, gene expression, immune response, and oxidative status wereanalyzed as a one-way ANOVA of PROC GLM of SAS(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).Data for ADFI, FCR,and HDEP were analyzed using a split-plot in time,whereas, for lesion score, a non-parametric test Krus-kal’s wallis was performed.
The level of signi ﬁcance was set at P<0.05, a tendency at 0.05 ≤P≤0.1, and means were separated using Fisher ’s LSD ( Choi et al., 2023b ). RESULTS Laying Hen Performance The effect of dietary inclusion of VD or VE on the growth performance of laying hens is shown in Table 3 .During the adaptation period, no signi ﬁcant differences were observed in the performance of laying hens amongdifferent treatment groups.At 6 DPI, the BW of layinghens challenged with Eimeria was reduced by at least 7%, whereas pair-feeding only reduced it by 3% ( P< 0.0001).The BWG showed a similar trend as that ofBW at 6 DPI; however, at 14 DPI, BWG was similar across all treatment groups ( P<0.0001).By 21 DPI, the BW of laying hens recovered back to that of UChens except for that of VD ( P= 0.0630).Dietary inclu- sion of either vitamin did not signi ﬁcantly improve growth performance of laying hens following the Eime- riachallenge.
Prior to the Eimeria challenge during the adaptation period, no signi ﬁcant difference was observed for HDEP among the treatment groups ( Figure 1 ). Following the Eimeria challenge, HDEP signi ﬁcantly dropped in CC (46.69%); however, dietary inclusion of VD and VEimproved the HDEP by 10.36% and 13.77%, respec-tively ( P<0.0001).Although vitamin inclusion improved the HDEP of laying hens, it could not completelyimprove to the level of the unchallenged PF (70.16%),which was 27.82% lower than the UC ( Figure 2 ).A sig- niﬁcant drop in egg production was observed in the sec- ond week of the Eimeria challenge in CC hens (8.06%), Table 3.Effect of dietary inclusion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3and DL- atocopherol acetate on growth performance of laying hens at peak production.

Follow- ing the Eimeria challenge at 25 wk of age, ADFI started to drop, beginning at 4 DPI in challenged hens, which did not recover until 16 DPI ( P<0.0001; Figure 3 ). Dur- ing the challenged period, the inclusion of vitaminsdidn ’t have signi ﬁcant improvement in ADFI.However, FCR was signi ﬁcantly improved by the inclusion of vita- mins, VD and VE ( P<0.0001; Figure 4 ).The highest FCR was observed in CC hens on the second week of theEimeria challenge (7.93 kg feed/dozen of eggs), followed by VD (4.77 kg feed/dozen of eggs), VE (4.01 kg feed/ dozen of eggs), and PF (1.35 kg feed/dozen of eggs).Overall, dietary inclusion of VD and VE improved theFigure 3.Effect of dietary inclusion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3and DL- atocopherol acetate on average daily feed intake post- Eimeria challenge at wk 25 from 0 to 21 DPI.Starting wk 25, hens grouped in CC, VD, and VE were challenged with sporulated oocysts of 12,500 E.maxima , 12,500 E.tenella , and 62,500 E.acervulina .

Gastrointestinal Permeability, Lesion Score, Oocyst Counts, and Intestinal Morphology The effect of the inclusion of VD or VE on intestinal permeability is shown in Figure 5 .Dietary inclusion of VD or VE signi ﬁcantly reduced the leakage of FITC-d into the bloodstream of the Eimeria -challenged hens by 0.19 and 0.22 mg/mL, respectively ( P<0.0001).Dietary inclusion of VD or VE reduced the severity of intestinal lesion scores for E.acervulina, E.maxima , and E.tenella from higher scores to lower scores by at least 10, 20, and30%, respectively, as shown in Figure 6 .
Furthermore, the addition of VD in the basal diet at the rate of5,000 IU/kg of the diet reduced the oocyst shedding ofE. acervulina by log 100.55 oocysts/g of feces ( P< 0.0001; Table 4 ); however, no difference was observed forE.maxima andE.tenella .Dietary inclusion of VE did not have any effect on oocyst shedding.At 6 DPI, the Eimeria challenge signi ﬁcantly reduced the VH of the duodenum and jejunum and increased theCD of all three sections of the intestine compared to Figure 5.Effect of dietary inclusion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3and DL- atocopherol acetate on gut permeability at 5 DPI.Starting wk 25, hens grouped in CC, VD, and VE were challenged with sporulated oocysts of 12,500 E.maxima , 12,500 E.tenella , and 62,500 E.acervulina .UC: unchal- lenged control, PF: pair-fed control, CC: challenged control (12,500 E.maxima ; 12,500 E.tenella ; 62,500 E.

At 14 DPI, the TAC concentra- tion was signi ﬁcantly increased with the inclusion of VE compared to the UC; however, it was signi ﬁcantly reduced in the PF group ( P= 0.0101).No signi ﬁcant changes were observed in any of the oxidative markers at 21 DPI ( P>0.05).DISCUSSION This study evaluated the effect of dietary 25-hydroxy- vitamin D 3and DL- a-tocopherol acetate individually in laying hens at peak production on bird performance, gut health, and immune response following the Eimeria infection.Although dietary supplementation with VDor VE did not have a bene ﬁcial effect on the growth per- formance of the laying hens, they did improve egg pro-duction, maintain tight junction integrity, and improvegut morphometry under coccidiosis.
The negative effect of coccidiosis on the growth and production performance of laying hens observed has been reported previously, and it might be associatedwith reduced FI due to the damage and pain in ﬂicted by the coccidia to the gastrointestinal tract, increasedinﬂammatory and immune responses against the proto- zoa, and oxidative stress ( Allen and Fetterer, 2002 ; Teng et al., 2020 ;Fatemi et al., 2021 ;Liu et al., 2023 ; Choi et al., 2023a ;Sharma et al., 2024a ,b).

In the cur- rent study, dietary supplementation with either VD orVE improved the egg production of coccidia-infectedlaying hens, which is similar to the previous challengestudies, either non-challenged or challenged withEscherichia coli lipopolysaccharides, Salmonella enteri- tidis, or heat-stressed ( Bollengier-Lee et al., 1999 ;Yard- ibi and Ho ¸st€urk, 2008 ;Jiang et al., 2013 ;Geng et al., 2018;Liu et al., 2019 ;Chen et al., 2020 ). The role of VD is not limited to calcium and phosphorus homeostasis,but also plays a major role in follicular development andoocyte maturation by increasing the expression of VDRin oocytes ( Grzesiak, 2020 ;Xu et al., 2021 ).Further- more, laying hens fed a VD-de ﬁcient diet ceased laying and had decreased ovarian weight and plasma estradiol/progesterone levels, further signifying the role of VD in egg production ( Ruschkowski and Hart, 1992 ).
During coccidiosis, oxidative stress is prominent, and it nega-tively affects the hormonal balance and follicular devel-opment and may induce follicular atresia, leading toreduced egg production ( Liu et al., 2018a ;Zhu et al., 2021;Bao et al., 2022 ;Wu et al., 2023 ;Sharma et al., 2024a, b ). It has been observed that the anti-m €ullerian hormone produced by the granulosa cells layer of hen ovarian follicles markedly decreased at the stage of follic- ular selection ( Huang et al., 2021 ).However, VD can regulate the level of anti-m €ullerian hormone, thus select- ing the follicles for maturation and egg formation ( Irani and Merhi, 2014 ;Grzesiak, 2020 ).On the other hand, VE is a potent antioxidant that prevents radical-induced damage to the body.In the current study, VEsigniﬁcantly upregulated the expression of iNOS, thus increasing the production of nitric oxide, which plays a signiﬁcant role in immune modulation and as an antioxi- dant ( Patel et al., 2000 ).
Furthermore, nitric oxide acts as a neurotransmitter for the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of laying hens, in ﬂuencing ovarian mor- phology and increasing secretion of gonadotropin-releas-ing hormone ( GnRH ), GnRH receptor, follicle- stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estrogen receptor, and IGF-1 important for egg production (Uyanga et al., 2022 ). In addition, it has been observed that VD and VE increased the concentration of the folli- cle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, andestrogen levels in serum ( Geng et al., 2018 ;Fu et al., 2022).In the current study, dietary VD and VE individ- ually improved tight junction integrity and small intesti-nal morphology during the recovery period, which might have allowed for the accumulation of key nutrients nec- essary for egg production.
In addition, VD and VE, bothbeing fat-soluble vitamins, might play some role in vitel-logenesis by facilitating the release of yolk precursorsfrom the liver and by increasing their concentration inthe blood ( Jiang et al., 2013 ). Collectively, these changes might have contributed to improving the egg productionobserved in the coccidia-infected laying hens.In the current study, top dressing VD or VE as a die- tary supplement in the basal diets improved the gastro-intestinal integrity of the laying hens, as observed by thereduced intestinal lesions, permeability, and improvedintestinal morphometry during the recovering phase (14DPI), which is supported by previous studies ( Mura- kami et al., 2007 ;Sakkas et al., 2019 ;Wang et al., 2023 ).
During coccidiosis, it has been reported that the small intestine morphometric parameters change as a defense mechanism to limit the multiplication of Eimeria spp.or damage in ﬂicted by the release of merozoites ( Sharma et al., 2022 ;Choi et al., 2023a ;Liu et al., 2023 ). As a result, VH gets shortened, and CD increases, indicating ahigher epithelial turnover.At 6 DPI, VD and VEincreased the expression of tight junction proteinCLDN-1, and MUC-2 expression at 14 DPI, which plays an important role in intestinal barrier functions ( Ullu- wishewa et al., 2011 ).Although the exact mechanism of how VD affects the intestinal barrier function is notclear, it is speculated that VD ensures an appropriate Figure 8.Effect of dietary inclusion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3and DL- atocopherol acetate on oxidative status of laying hens at 6 and 14 DPI.Starting wk 25, hens grouped in CC, VD, and VE were challenged with sporulated oocysts of 12,500 E.maxima , 12,500 E.tenella , and 62,500 E.acervulina .

Furthermore, VE is incorporated in the cell membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells, protecting it against reactive oxygen spe-cies and free radicals, therefore preserving its functionsand integrity ( Tappel, 1972 ;Fu et al., 2022 ). Pro- and anti-in ﬂammatory cytokines play a major role in immune and in ﬂammatory responses against pathogens( Hong et al., 2006 ).In this current experi- ment, the expression of IL-1 bwas increased signi ﬁcantly following infection in hens supplemented with VD and VE.This increase in the in ﬂammatory responses is a defense mechanism by the host to improve the defenseagainst coccidial infection ( Shanmugasundaram et al., 2019).However, the results associated with IL-1 bare contradictory among different studies ( Morris et al., 2015;Shojadoost et al., 2015 ;Shanmugasundaram et al., 2019 ).
The increased expression of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in coccidia-infected laying hens was likely associ- ated with a Th-1 mediated in ﬂammatory response via upregulation of IFN- g(Laidlaw et al., 2016 ). Further- more, CD8+ cells are cytotoxic T cells that, when acti-vated by infected cells, increase the production ofcytokines (i.e.IFN- g) or induce apoptosis by producing cytotoxic proteins (perforin and granzymes), thus collec-tively, limiting the coccidia proliferation in enterocytes (Laidlaw et al., 2016 ).In addition, dietary VD supple- mentation preferentially increased peripheral blood het-erophils, whereas dietary VE supplementation increasedthe peripheral blood monocytes in the coccidia-infectedlaying hens.Still, heterophils and monocytes both havea phagocytic function.
Monocytes, upon maturation inthe tissues, become macrophages and when activated,have the ability to induce a potent pro-in ﬂammatory response via nitric oxide production, as well as stimulate T-cell and B-cell proliferation and activation ( Perez- Carbajal et al., 2010 ). The increased heterophils, observed in coccidia-infected birds supplemented withVD, likely limited the coccidia multiplication asobserved by reduced E.acervulina oocyst shedding via increased phagocytosis, whereas in the coccidia-infectedVE-supplemented birds, the observed increased mono- cyte population might be associated with an increase in nitric oxide production ( Perez-Carbajal et al., 2010 ).This observation is supported by previous studies whichreported that VD triggers macrophages to produce nitricoxide to limit infection ( Morris et al., 2015 ;Shojadoost et al., 2015 ;Shanmugasundaram et al., 2019 ).
Based on the results from the current study, it can be concluded that the reduced laying performance of laying hens upon coccidia infection can be ascribed partly to the reduced feed intake during infection and partly tothe development of oxidative and immune stressfollowing gut damage and nutritional costs associated with it. The dietary top dressing of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3(5,000 IU/kg of diet) or vitamin E (100 IU/kg of diet) was able to partially alleviate the symptoms of coc-cidiosis by improving gut health, immune response, andoxidative status.Furthermore, both VD and VEimproved the laying hen ’s performance by limiting the damage to the intestinal tract, thus limiting in ﬂamma- tion and oxidative stress.DISCLOSURES The authors declare no con ﬂicts of interest.REFERENCES Adhikari, P., C.H.Lee, D.E.Cosby, N.A.Cox, and W.K.Kim.2019.
