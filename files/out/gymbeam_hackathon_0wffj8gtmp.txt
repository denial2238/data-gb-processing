Keywords: preoperative calcium supplementation, preopera tive magnesium supplementation, thyroidectomy, postoperative hypocalcemia, quality of life, ThyPRO-39, EQ- 5D-5L INTRODUCTION Thyroid surgery is one of the most common surgeries worldwid e (1).Although the total number of thyroid surgeries has decreased in Germany in the l ast years, the proportion of total thyroidectomies (TT) is increasing ( 2).Total thyroidectomy is performed for example in case of malignancy, suspected bilobular or symptomatic nodular goiter or graves’ disease.Hypocalcemia Tabriz et al.Prophylactic Calcium Supplementation in Thyroidectomy is one of the most common complications of bilateral thyroid resections with an incidence ranging from 0.3 to 49% ( 3).
Symptoms of postoperative hypocalcemia can range from mild paresthesia and peripheral muscular spasms to laryngospasm and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias ( 4). These symptoms do not only lead to extended hospital stay but also reduces patients’ quality of life ( 5,6).Therefore, serum calcium (and) parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are monitored in the early postoperative course.Especially, due to the very short half-li fe of PTH (3–5 mins), early postoperative PTH determination can help to detect postoperative hypoparathyroidism.PTH levels <15 pg/mL at least 20 mins or more following TT might predict potential therapy-relevant hypoparathyroidism ( 7,8).In a recent study, a cut-oﬀ PTH value of >19.95 pg/mL during the immediate postoperative period was established for a safe early dischargewithoutsupplementationofcalciumandvitaminD( 9).
Despite this clinically accepted postoperative procedure, ther e are no generally accepted postoperative hypoparathyroidism management recommendations. Recently, a meta-analysis has conﬁrmed the eﬀectiveness of calcium and vitamin D in the postoperative course for preventing hypocalcemia-associated symptoms.Yet, a routine supplementation could also lead to overtreatment in patients with normal serum calcium ( 10).In one of the few studies dealing with preventive preoperative calcium supplementation prior to total thyroidectomy it was shown that preoperative calcium carbonate supplementation eﬀectively reduced postoperative biochemical and symptomatic hypocalcemia( 11).Evidence exist that thyroidectomy can cause signiﬁcant hypomagnesaemia, possibly correlating with the development o f hypocalcemia ( 1,12–14).Therefore, postoperative monitoring after thyroidectomy, should include controlling both, ser um calciumandmagnesium.
This background provides the motivation for this study, which aims to investigate the quality of life and the developm ent of clinical hypocalcemia in relation to preoperative calcium and magnesium administration. We want to investigate whether a routine preoperative dietary supplementation of calcium and magnesium inﬂuences patients’ outcome with regard to hypocalcemia-associated symptoms and quality of life in order to reduce the risk of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia and to improve patient’s quality of life.This could potentially reduce hospital length of stay and medicalexpenses.The primary aim of this study is to investigate the inﬂuence of preoperative calcium and magnesium supplementations starting 2 weeks prior to surgery on quality of life measured by the ThyPRO-39 questionnaire over a time interval of 2 weeks prior to 6 weeks post-surgery in a randomized controlledtrial.
The secondary aim is to learn how the aforementioned supplementation may inﬂuence the development of clinical and biochemical hypocalcemia. In addition, the ThyPRO-39 and the EQ-5D-5L questionnaires outcomes should be compared at the timeofhospitaldischarge.FIGURE 1 | Study ﬂow chart.METHODS Trial Design We propose a prospective randomized controlled intervention study with a postoperative follow-up of 6 weeks ( Figure1; Table1).Study Setting The monocentric study will be conducted at a DGAV (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Allgemein- und Viszeralchirurgie; German Society for General and Visceral Surgery) certiﬁed center f or thyroid and parathyroid surgery in a German university hospit al forvisceralsurgery.Thehospitalperformsmorethan350thyr oid surgeriesperyear,ofwhichabout100areTTs.Eligibility Criteria Inclusioncriteria: •Adultpatients( >18years) •ScheduledforTT Frontiers in Surgery | www.frontiersin.org 2 January 2022 | Volume 8 | Article 758205 Tabriz et al.

Prophylactic Calcium Supplementation in Thyroidectomy Ingestion will begin 2 weeks preoperatively. The comparison group (control group; CG) will receive no nutritional supplements.The chosen supplementation period allows to build-up signiﬁcantly higher calcium and magnesium levels in IG-patientscomparedtoCG-patients.Patients assigned to the IG will receive calcium carbonate 3 ×500mg/d(CalciumSandoz R⃝500mg,Hexal)andmagnesium oxide1×375mg/d(Magnetrans R⃝375mg,StadaVital).Criteria for Discontinuing or Modifying Allocated Interventions One week after having started supplementation, IG-patients wi ll be contacted viaphone to evaluate their well-being and ask for any side eﬀects.If patients report any intervention-related s ide eﬀects (e.g., diarrhea), patients may reduce the dose or stop ingestion.Thosepatientswillbeexcludedfromtheanalysis.Strategies to Improve Adherence to Interventions Theplannedphonecallismeanttoimproveadherence.
Relevant Concomitant Care Permitted or Prohibited During the Trial Notapplicable. Provisions for Post-trial Care Since the supplementation dosage is within the range of recommended calcium and magnesium uptake, no harm from trial participation is expected.However, patients are encoura ged tocontacttheinvolvedphysiciansatanytime.Outcomes Primary outcome will be the postoperative quality of life measured by the ThyPRO-39 questionnaire over time between bothgroups.Secondary outcomes will be the post-operative biochemical levels of calcium and PTH, the development of clinical hypocalcemia (symptoms as reported by the patient) during post-operative hospital stay, and the ThyPRO-39 and EQ-5D-5L resultsathospitaldischarge.Participant Timeline After checking the indication for total thyroidectomy and obtaining informed consent, the patients’s quality of life wi ll be assessed by the health-related EQ-5D-5L and the disease- speciﬁc questionnaire ThyPRO-39 ( Figure1).
Laboratory tests for thyrotropin (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), f ree tetraiodothyronine (fT4), calcium, magnesium, phosphate, albumin, 25-OH vitamin D3, PTH, alkaline phosphatase (AP) will be performed. Patients’ biometric data (age, weight, si ze, bodymassindex)andtheultrasoundthyroidexaminationres ults willberecorded.TABLE 2 | Postoperative procedure dependent on PTH levels on ﬁrst postoperative day.PTH<15 pg/mlPTH 15-30 pg/mlPTH 30–65 pg/mlPTH> 65 pg/ml Alphacalcidol 0,5 µg 2×d – – – Calcium carbonate 2 ×1g 2 ×1g as required 1gas required 1g Magnesium oxide 2 ×375mg 375mg – – Patients assigned to the intervention group will start supplementationasdescribedabove.One day before the scheduled operation, the ThyPRO-39 questionnaire will be ﬁlled out again and PTH, calcium and magnesiumlevelswillbedetermined.Thyroidectomy will be, by default, performed under intraoperative neuromonitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerves.
Intraoperatively, the macroscopic view of the parathyroid glands and description of structure and blood ﬂow are required. If the lower parathyroid glands are not in loco typico, an explicit representation is not necessary.In the case of an accidentally removed parathyroid gland or insuﬃcient blood supply, the gland is removed, cut into small cubes and autologously reimplanted in a muscle pocket of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.The aﬀected patient is then excludedfromthestudy.Postoperatively, all patients are routinely monitored on the intermediate care unit, especially with regard to potentia l postoperative hemorrhage.PTH and calcium will be checked on ﬁrst postoperative day.Depending to the measured PTH level (norm 15–65 pg/ml) calcium with or without Alfacalcido l (Einsalpha R⃝, LEO) will be supplemented, regardless of group aﬃliation( Table2).Before patient’s discharge, the EQ-5D-5L and ThyPRO- 39 will be completed for a third time.
Patient’s discharge is planned on the 2nd or 3rd postoperative day depending on his condition. The histological result will be available withi n 24– 48h postoperatively.In case of benign histology, L-Thyroxin substitution is started at a dosage of 1.5 µg per body weight and isadjustedatthefollowingexaminationafter6weeksdependi ng onthyroidparameters.Six weeks postoperatively laboratory examinations for TSH, fT3, fT4, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, albumin, 25-OH vitamin D3, PTH, AP and ThyPRO-39 questionnaire will be carried out during a clinical visit.In case of PTH <15 pg/ml, the therapeutic goal of vitamin D-, calcium- and magnesium-substitution is to achieve a serum calcium level in the lower normal range (2.0–2.2 mmol/l).At the beginning of the substitution, calcium and phosphate values should be determined at 2-weekly intervals and vitamin D dose should be adjusted by 10– 20% depending on the calcium level.
The laboratory exams will be repeated after 6 months to determine a potential persistenthypoparathyroidism.

The sample size calculation for the between-factors (i .e., supplementationornot)RepeatedMeasuresAnalysisofVariance (RM ANOVA) for the test of the primary outcome was based on thefollowingassumptions: •Eﬀectsizef =0.25 •αerrprob=0.05 •Power(1- βerrprob) =0.8 •Numberofgroups =2 •Numberofmeasurements =4 •Correlationamongrepeatedmeasures =0.4 The eﬀect size was calculated based on a mean of 30 points and a standard deviation of 19.6 for the ThyPRO-39 composite score for the control group [according to ( 15)]. We assumed a mean decrease of about 10 points, which reﬂects a clinically relev ant change,andnochangeinstandarddeviationfortheinterven tion group.This yields the aforementioned eﬀect size.Using these assumptions, an overall sample size of 72 patients is needed.To accountfordropouts,weareplanningtoinclude80patients.

PTH can already been determined 20 mins after TT and cut-oﬀ values of <15 pg/mL or <20 pg/mL, also depending on the assay used, can help to predict the likelihood of therapy- relevantpostoperativehypoparathyroidism( 7–9).Duetoclinical practical application, we decide to determine PTH and calcium levelontheﬁrstpostoperativedayandtosubstitutecalciumw ith or without vitamin D depending on the PTH value. Thereby, supplementation of calcium and vitamin D can be applied to facilitateasafeearlydischargeleadingtocostsavings,f orinstance by reducing inpatient treatment time, and improved patients’ satisfactionandqualityoflife.There is ample evidence, including meta-analysis and systematic reviews, conﬁrming the eﬀectiveness of early postoperative calcium and vitamin D supplementation on postoperative outcome after TT ( 10,16).
Yet, only few studies have examined the role of a prophylactic preoperative calcium (and) vitamin D supplementation on postoperative hypocalcemia.Inaprospectivestudywithpre-andpostoperative calcium and vitamin D supplementation in 50 patients undergoing TT, the incidence of symptomatic hypocalcemia was 6% and of laboratory hypocalcemia it was 10%. However, that study did not include a no control group ( 17).Jaan et al.(18) examined 46 patients who underwent total or near TT in a randomized controlled trial.They randomly divided the patients into two groups, one group ( n= 24) receiving calcium and vitamin D 7 days pre- and 7 days postoperatively, and one group did not receive such supplementation.They concluded that routine vitamin D and calcium supplementation can signiﬁcantly reduce postoperativ e hypocalcemia.
However, in that study perioperative PTH levels and vitamin D deﬁciency were not measured and diﬀerent thyroid diseases (thyroid cancer, graves’ disease and nodular goiter) were included. In graves’ disease, it is wel l known that patients have much higher rates of symptomatichypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy than with other diagnosis due to, for example, the “hungry bone syndrome” and blood supply disturbances of the parathyroid glands (19–21).Oltmann et al.( 11) examined the eﬀect of 2 weeks of preoperative calcium supplementation (3 grams/day) on postoperative hypocalcaemia in comparison to a historic matched non-supplemented group with graves’ disease.They stated that calcium supplementation before TT for graves’ disease signiﬁcantly reduces biochemical and symptomatic postoperativehypocalcemia.
It has to be pointed out that for comparison of diﬀerent thyroid diseases such as graves’ disease, nodular goiter, or cancer, subgroup analysis should be performed as the pathophysiology of postoperative hypoparathyroidism depends on the primary diagnosis and on the extent of surgery (i.e., TT plus lymph node dissection). In order to avoid surgery-related hypoparathyroidism due to central or lateral lymph node dissection, only TT for benign diseases such as symptomatic nodular goiter or graves’ disease is included in ourtrial.Studies on the role of preoperative vitamin D level on early postoperative hypocalcemia reveal contradictory results.On t he one hand, low preoperative vitamin D and low postoperative parathyroid hormone levels were seen as predictors for the development of hypocalcemia ( 22,23).On the other hand, these biochemical parameters could not be detected as a risk factor i n other studies ( 9,24,25).
Therefore, for our planned study, the inﬂuence of vitamin D level on postoperative hypocalcemia is alsoregarded. We assume that a prophylactic dietary supplementation with calcium and magnesium, which could easily be implemented in the preoperative setting, could potentially help to avoid or reduce hypocalcemia-associated symptoms and improve quality of life.Due to lacking data concerning the optimal duration f or a preoperative supplementation period, we have pragmatically used the data of Oltmann et al.( 11).Also, the amount of calcium and magnesium to be administered could be subject to discussion.Wedecidedtoprescribe1500mgcalciumand375mg magnesium that is not harmful for patients, as potential side eﬀectsarerareandassociatedwithmuchhigherdoses,accord ing totheEFSA-recommendations( 26,27).
Following the here presented preoperative procedure may be useful to prepare patients scheduled for thyroidectomy and can possibly reduce disease-speciﬁc costs and improve patient’s qualityoflife.
