Column temperature was set at 50‚àòC and quantitation was achieved by UV detection at 225nm. In forced degradation studies, the drug was subjected to oxidation, hydrolysis, photolysis, and heat.Amongthe different stress conditions, the exposure to acidic and basic conditions was found to be an important adverse stability factor.Themethodwasvalidatedforspecificity,selectivity,linearity,pr ecision,accuracy,androbustness.Theappliedprocedurewasfound tobelinearinl-carnitineconcentrationrangeof84.74‚Äì3389.50 ùúág/mL(ùëü 2=0.9997) .Precisionwasevaluatedbyreplicateanalysis in which relative standard deviation (RSD) values for areas were found below 2.0%.The recoveries obtained (100.83%‚Äì101.54%) ensuredtheaccuracyofthedevelopedmethod.Theexpandeduncertainty(3.14%)ofthemethodwasalsoestimatedfrommethod validation data.Accordingly, the proposed validated and rapid procedure was proved to be suitable for routine analyzing andstabilitystudiesof l-carnitineintablets.1.
Introduction l-Carnitine ((R)-3-carboxy-2-hydroxy-N,N,N-trimethyl-1- propaminiumhydroxideinnersalt, Figure1(a) )isavitamin- like amino acid derivative, which is an essential factor infatty acid metabolism as acyltransferase cofactor and inenergy production processes, such as interconversion in themechanismsofregulationofketogenesisandthermogenesis.Therefore, lack of l-carnitine leads to lipid accumulation inthecytosolandimpairedenergyproductionfromlong-chainfatty acids, especially during periods of fasting or stress. l-Carnitinepharmaceuticalpreparations,includinginjections,syrups, tablets, and capsules, are used in the therapy ofprimary and secondary carnitine deficiency, and in otherdiseasessuchasdislipoproteinemiaandAlzheimer‚Äôs[ 1‚Äì4].A detailed literature survey revealed that there are few analytical methods reported for the estimation of l-Carni-tine in pharmaceutical formulations.
The US Pharmacopeia(USP) provides two HPLC methods for quantitation of l-carnitine in oral solution and tablet formulations. Themethod for tablets involves an aminopropylsilane-bondedsilica gel column, acetonitrile-phosphate buffer (pH 4.7) mobilephase,anddetectionat205nm.Thismethodrequiresa prolonged equilibration of the column (6h), which istherefore time consuming in case the formulation containsan organic acid, due to the long retention time of the acidunderthespecifiedHPLCconditions[ 5].Ontheotherhand, for solution formulations, USP presents an HPLC methodusing ion-pairing modifiers.However, this method cannotseparatecrotonoylbetaine(impurityA)( Figure1(b) ),amajor impurity and degradation product, from l-carnitine [ 6].Other reported methods for quantification of l-carnitine in tablets are limited in either low sensitivity for dissolution testingornotbeingstability-indicating[ 5‚Äì8].
Environmental conditions, including light, heat, and humidity and the susceptibility of the substance towardshydrolysis or oxidation can play an important role in theproductionofimpurities.Astabilitystudyensuresthemain-tenanceofproductquality,safety,andefficacythroughoutitsshelf life. Stress testing can help identify degradation prod-ucts and provide important information about the intrinsicstability of drug substances [ 9,10].Regulatory agenciesHindawi Publishing Corporation International Scholarly Research Notices Volume 2014, Article ID 481059, 7 pages http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/481059 2 InternationalScholarlyResearchNotices CH3 CH3NO H OH H3C O‚àí (a)CH3 CH3NO H3C O‚àí (b) Figure1:Molecularstructuresof l-carnitine(a)andcrotonoylbetaine(b).recommend the use of stability-indicating assay methods for the analysis of stability samples [ 11].
With the advent of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)guidelines [ 12,13], requirements for the establishment of stability-indicatingassaymethodshavebecomemoreclearlymandated[ 14]. Taking ICH guidelines into consideration, the present study describes a simple, validated, and stability-indicatinganalyticalmethodfordeterminationof l-carnitineintablets.Also, the calculation of the measurement uncertainty whichi sb a s e do nt h ev a l i d a t i o no ft h ea n a l y t i c a lp r o c e d u r e si nalaboratory is presented.Moreover, the performances of themethod were evaluated and its potential for the determina-tionof l-carnitineintabletswasinvestigated.2.Experimental Section 2.1.Materials,Reagents,andChemicals.Qualifiedl-carnitine l-tartratestandard(99.37%equivalentto67.79%l-carnitine)and crotonoylbetaine (impurity A) were kindly provided byPoursina pharmaceuticals (Tehran, Iran).

Ten tablets‚Äô (l-carnitine label claim: 250mg per tablet) content was weighed and theaverage weight of each tablet was calculated.Tablet powderequivalentto250mgoftheactivepharmaceuticalingredientwas transferred into a 25mL volumetric flask.To this, 15mL ofwaterwasaddedandsonicatedfor10minutes.Thesolutionwas then diluted to 25mL with diluent and centrifugeda t3 0 0 0 r p mf o r1 0 m i n .T w om Lo ft h es u p e r n a t a n tw a stransferred into a 10mL volumetric flask.Thereafter, thevolume was adjusted to the mark with the same mediumto provide a theoretical concentration of 2.00mg/mL of l-carnitine.The experiment was performed by triplicate.Thel-carnitine dissolution profiles were studied in marketedtablets(250mg),andthemeasurementswereobtainedusingthe paddle apparatus described in Method 2 of USP.Theagitation speed used was 75rpm, which are the recom-mended conditions for dissolution methods applied in USPl-carnitine monograph.

All analyses were performed at the column temper-ature of 50¬±1 ‚àòC under isocratic conditions with a mobile phase of 0.05M phosphate buffer (pH = 3): ethanol (99:1),including 0.56mg/mL of sodium 1-heptanesulfonate and aflowrateof2.0mL/min,usingUVdetectionat225nm. 2.5.Forced Degradation Studies.The stability-indicating capability of the method was determined by subjecting l-carnitine solutions (standard and pharmaceutical prepara-tions)attheconcentrationlevelof6.78mg/mLtoaccelerateddegradation by acidic, basic, heat, oxidative, and photolyticconditionstoevaluatetheinterferencesinthequantitationofl-carnitine.Sample solutions prepared in 1M hydrochloricacid and 1M sodium hydroxide were used for the acidicandbasichydrolysis,respectively.Bothsolutionswereheatedat 70 ‚àòC for 12h and then neutralized with basic or acidic InternationalScholarlyResearchNotices 3 solutions, as necessary.
For evaluating the heat condition, the sample solutions heated at 70‚àòCf o r1 2h .F o ro x i d a t i v e degradation, sample solutions were exposed to a solution ofhydrogenperoxide(3%)andkeptatambienttemperaturefor4h, protected from light.

For method repeatability, assay of working standard solutions (84.74, 169.48, 1355.80, and 3389.50 ùúág/mL) was repeatedly performed five times on the same day (intraday).For reproducibility, freshly prepared solutions at aforemen-tioned concentration levels were analyzed at different days(interday) and results were statistically evaluated in terms of%RS D . For recovery studies, preassayed portions of powdered tablets equivalent to 250mg of l-carnitine were spiked withextra0.25,0.50,and0.75mLofasolutionof100mg/mLof l-carnitine.Thesesampleswerehandledasexplainedinsamplepreparation section and the final target levels of 2.20, 2.40,and 2.60mg/mL were prepared.The concentrations werecalculatedusingcalibrationcurves.Accuracy was calculated as the deviation of the mean fromnominalconcentration.Toassessaccuracy,freshlypre-pared placebo of the l-carnitine pharmaceutical tablets wasspikedwithvariousamountsof l-carnitinetoobtainthecon-centrationlevelsof84.74,169.48,1355.80,and3389.50 ùúág/mL.

The HPLC procedure was optimized with a view to develop astability-indicating HPLC method with a short run timewhile keeping the system suitability necessities according toUSP, which needs the resolution between l-carnitine andimpurity A and the relative standard deviation for replicateinjection to be greater than 1.0 and less than 2.0%, respec-tively. Moreover, the method should be sensitive enough tobeabletoestimatedissolutionprofileofthetablets.Initialeffortforthemethoddevelopmentconsideringthe high polarity of the analytes was made using USP mobilephase for determination of oral solutions in a commonODS column with 250mm length.Under this condition noseparation was achieved between l-carnitine and impurityA.Different pH(s) were screened by adjusting the pH of thebuffer.Optimum resolution was observed at pH 3.0.How-ever, the peaks were tailed and the resolution between theanalytes did not meet the USP requirement.
In our previousexperimentwithdiltiazemanalysis,whichisatertiaryamine,we realized that using ethanol as organic modifier in mobilephase provided sharper peaks and better resolution betweendiltiazem and its impurity [ 16]. Therefore, ethanol was used instead of methanol in the composition of the mobile phase,whichledtosharperpeakscomparedtoamobilephasecon- sisting of methanol but the analytes were not well resolved.Thereafter, optimization of ethanol content in mobile phase,column temperature, and flow rate was performed and thebest peak shapes and resolution were obtained when theaforementionedparametersweresetat1.0%,50.0 ‚àòC,and2.0, respectively.Considering low UV absorptivity of carnitine,wavelengthof225nmwaschosentohavesuitablesensitivity.
Under the chromatographic conditions of this method, theresolutionbetweencrotonoylbetaineandl-carnitinewas1.1¬±0.9% (Figure2), the theoretical plates for l-carnitine peak was 2087.0¬±0.82%, the tailing factor for l-carnitine peak was 1.3¬±1.54%, and total run time was less than 8min.

l-Carnitine showed drastic degradation in acidic and basic conditions, in the fact that only 24.0% ¬±0.81 and 17.35%¬±1.72 of the drug remained, respectively, and at the same time anadditional peak was detected at 2min (Figures 3(c)and 3(d)).Theforceddegradationstudiesinphotolytic,heat,and oxidative conditions, resulted in nonsignificant decrease oftheareawithoutanydetectableelutingdegradationproduct.Under these conditions, 99.50% ¬±0.63, 93.09%¬±1.93, and 100.17%¬±1.28 of l-carnitine were recovered, respectively (Figures3(a),3(e),a n d3(b)). The degradation products of the parent compound were found to be similar for both thepharmaceutical and standard solutions.All the degradationstudiesaresummarizedin Table 1.3.3.MethodValidation 3.3.1.Specificity.

Furthermore, the decreases observed in l-carnitine contents in stability studies, when degradationproducts appeared, proved the specificity of the method(Table 1).Consequently, the forced degradation studies doc- umented the stability indicating power and specificity of theproposedmethod.3.3.2.Linearity, Precision, and LOQ.
Linearity was deter- mined by constructing five independent calibration curves,each with six calibration points of l-carnitine, including theLOQ,intherangeof84.74‚Äì3389.50 ùúág/mL.Thepeakareasof l-carnitine against the respective concentrations were usedfor plotting the graph, and the linearity was evaluated by t h el e a s ts q u a r er e g r e s s i o na n a l y s i s .Th el i n e a r i t yc u r v ew a s defined by the following equation: ùë¶=0.19ùë•+2.31 (ùëü 2= 0.9997)whichindicatedthelinearityofthecalibrationcurve forthemethod.Moreover,therelativestandarderrorofslopecanbeusedasaparameterwithrespecttotheprecisionoftheregression, as a general acceptance criterion for the linearityperformanceoftheanalyticalprocedure[ 17].Thisparameter shouldbecomparabletothecalculatedRSDintheevaluationoftheprecision.Inthisstudy,theresultobtainedfortheRSDof the slopes was 1.92% which is comparable to mean value1.56%, of the RSD of theprecision. Summary of the method validation results is shown in Table 2.
The method was proved to be precise, as the intra- andinterdayprecisioncalculatedfortheconcentrationlevelsof 169.48, 1355.80, and 3389.50 ùúág/mL ranged from 0.41% to 1 . 8 4 %a n d0 .9 9 %t o1 .6 0 % ,r e s p e c t i v e l y .Th e s ev a l u e sf u l fi l lthe validation criteria of an analytical method designed forquality control of pharmaceutical preparations for which RSDvalues<2%areacceptable[ 17].The LOQ is the lowest concentration that can be quan- tified with acceptable precision and accuracy.The LOQ ofl-carnitine was determined to be 84.74 ùúág/mL, considering the mean accuracy value of 97.27% and RSD value of 3.34%(Table 2).These values indicate that the proposed method is more sensitive than what have reported previously foranalysisof l-carnitineintabletformulationsusingUVdetec-tion (LOQ = 400ùúág/mL) [6].
The theoretically ‚Äúexpected‚Äù concentration of l-carnitine after the dissolution experi-ments is ca.277.78ùúág/mL (250mg l-carnitine per tablet in 900mL dissolution medium assuming quantitative dissolu-tion).

Robustness. Chromatographic parameters including percentage of assay, resolution between l-carnitine and itsimpurity, theoretical plates, and tailing factor of l-carnitinepeaks were not significantly affected by the slight changes inthe chromatographic conditions like alteration in flow rates,pH of the aqueous solution of mobile phase, and columntemperature.Analysis was carried out in triplicate and onlyoneparameterwaschangedintheexperimentsatatime.Theresults of the experimental variables evaluated were withint h ea c c e p t a b l ed e v i a t i o n( R S D <2%), the resolution of the aforementionedpeakswasmorethan1.0,andthetheoreticalplates and tailing factor parameters were calculated to bemorethan2000andlessthan1.4,respectively,indicatingthattheproposedmethodisrobustundertheconditionstested.3.3.5.The Uncertainty of the Method.
