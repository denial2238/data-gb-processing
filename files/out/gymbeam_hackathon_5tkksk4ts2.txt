Sarcopenia prevalence is further confounded by the diﬀerent cut-points adopted by several key working groups such as the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People, the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia, and the International Working Group on Sarcopenia that may be region-speciﬁc in their application ( 2). Research in Malaysia on sarcopenia is still limited, but one study among 393 adults aged 60 years and over reported an overall prevalence of 33.6% ( 3).The prevalence of sarcopenia(anditscomponents)isrelatedtoexorbitanthealthcare costs (4), and thus the maintenance of muscle mass, strength, and function is critical to avoid the ﬁnancial burden related to home- assisted living and institutionalized care in older people ( 5).With no known pharmaceuticals available to treat sarcopenia ( 6,7), strategies to increase muscle mass, strength, and function focus on modiﬁablelifestylebehaviorsandpracticesthathavebeenshownto beeﬀective.
Adequate nutrition, such as high protein intake, suﬃcient calories, adequate omega n-3 fatty acid intakes, and regular exercise, is widely recommended for people diagnosed with sarcopenia ( 8). More speciﬁcally, current guidelines for the treatment and prevention of sarcopenia recommend muscle strengthening or progressive resistance training (PRT) along with an adequate intake of protein and suﬃcient vitamin D ( 9–12).In sarcopenic older adults, PRT exercises are safe and eﬀective to improve muscle health, and the addition of protein with PRT may providesomeadditional,albeitmodest,beneﬁtstomusclemassand strength ( 13,14).Despite these beneﬁts, adherence to PRT among community-dwelling older adults remains low ( <10–15%) ( 15).
Older people’s uptake and engagement with such programs can be inﬂuenced by a range of behavioral factors, such as motivation andpersonalbeliefs,aswellasenvironmentalfactors,includingthe availability of public transport, cost, and the location and type of exercisevenues( 16). Despitethepositiveresponsesfrompreviousstudiesevaluating the eﬀectiveness of exercise and/or nutritional intervention on sarcopenia outcomes ( 13,14), there has been little research performed in Malaysia.A large proportion of older adults in Malaysia are physically inactive, with 30% reporting not engaging in any regular activity ( 17).The Malaysian communitycomprises diﬀerent ethnicities, body sizes and compositions, food cultures, and physical activity habits compared to other populations ( 18,19).
To date, no studies have explored the beliefs and perceptions of older Malaysian adults with or at risk of sarcopenia about participating in a multi-modal lifestyle intervention incorporating high-intensity PRT with a whey-protein-based nutrition supplemental drink (WP). This is important to inform our understanding of the behaviors (motivation and barriers) and decision-making on sarcopenia in this population to inform future initiatives to prevent and treat this disease and support sustainable behavior change.Therefore, this pilot study aimed to identify the key facilitators and barriers for older Malaysian adults with sarcopenia to participate in a 12- week PRT program with or without the consumption of a WP nutritionalsupplement./two.tnum.Materials and methods /two.tnum./one.tnum.Study design Thisisaqualitativestudynestedwithina12-weekrandomized- controlled, two-arm trial involving PRT alone or combined PRT+WP supplementation.
This research was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Universiti Sains Malaysia(USM/JEPeM/18090405). /two.tnum./two.tnum.Participants We reached older Malaysian adults through online advertisements and community-focused areas such as mosques, community halls, and private health facilities.Using the Asian WorkingGroupforSarcopenia2019(AWGS2)( 20)guidelines,we initially screened for possible sarcopenia and included participants with a handgrip strength (HG) of <28kg (men) or <18kg (women)usingtheirdominantarmand/oraﬁve-timessit-to-stand time (5-STS) of 12s and more.HG test was conducted using a hand-held dynamometer (Jamar, USA), where the participants were seated and their arms bent at 90◦at the elbow.Participants were given verbal encouragement during each test and were instructed to squeeze as hard as they could and alternate arms to complete the test three times per arm.The highest value (in kg) obtained was used as the maximal HG strength.
Participants who were identiﬁed as having possible sarcopenia, physically inactive (did not achieve 150 min/week of physical activity), and did not participate in any structured exercise programs in the past 6 months were invited to join the study. Participants Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org Vijayakumaran et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum/six.tnum/five.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum who provided informed written consent later completed the rest of the assessments at the Universiti Sains Malaysia, Health Campus,Kelantan./two.tnum./three.tnum.Physical measures The following measures were assessed at baseline and post- intervention: Height measurements were conducted three times using a stadiometer (SECA, Germany), and participants’ weight was measured using a digital weighing scale (Omron, USA).
Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM, kg/m2) was assessed from a total body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (DXA, Discovery A, Hologic, USA), with low ASM classiﬁed as <7.0 kg/m2for men and <5.4 kg/m2for women ( 20). Physical performance was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) that includes balance (side-by-side, semi-tandem, andtandem),5-STS,anda4-mgaitassessment( 21),withimpaired physical performance classiﬁed as a SPPB score of ≤9.Sarcopenia classiﬁcations followed the possible sarcopenia (low grip strength and/or slow 5-STS time), sarcopenia (possible sarcopenia or low SPPB plus low ASM), and severe sarcopenia (presence of all three low measures) deﬁnitions from AWGS2 ( 20).Participants also completed the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) that includes measurements of left-side mid-arm and calf circumferences ( 22).
Additionally, we assessed stair ascent and descent time using a standardized set of 10 steps, whereby participants were asked to walk as quickly up or down the stairs as possible, with the time recordedtothenearest0.1s( 23). /two.tnum./four.tnum.Intervention A total of 16 participants (women) were randomized to the PRT+WP(n=8)orPRTalone( n=8)groups.Aresearchassistant used simple computer randomization to allocate the participants into their groups.Participants in the PRT +WP group had a daily weekdayservingof100%wheyproteinconcentrate(EnprovisPlus, Aegisu Sdn.Bhd.) that consists of 237 kcal, 15.1g protein, 250mg calcium, 3.3mg iron, 4.0 µg vitamin D, and other micronutrients that cover 14–93% of the daily recommended nutrient intake for those aged 60 years and above.The full nutrition composition is provided in Supplementarymaterial1 .The supplement was consumed as part of their morning breakfast on non-exercise days orwithina30-minwindowaftertheirexercisesessions.
All participants were prescribed a high-intensity PRT program that could be conducted at home thrice a week. Prior to commencing PRT, a qualiﬁed Master of Science in Exercise Science graduate assessed baseline muscle strength and taught proper exercise techniques and warm-up and cool-down activities to all participants.Participants had their blood pressure and heart rate checked using an automated blood pressure device (Omron, Japan) after sitting quietly for about 3min to rule out uncontrolled hypertension.Under supervision, participants practiced the exercise movements without any resistance bands twice a week for 2 weeks before the intervention period started.There were six resistance band exercises, namely, (i) squats, (ii)gluteal kickbacks, (iii) seated leg extensions, (iv) standing chest press, (v) standing diagonal pull apart, and (vi) seated row.
To assess1-RM,participantsweregivenaresistancebandtocomplete 10–12 repetitions of each exercise without losing their form or technique. If participants could complete 12 repetitions easily, a thicker (higher) resistance band was provided, and the same exercise was conducted after a 2–3min rest until the suitable resistance band was identiﬁed as the participant’s 1-RM load.If participants struggle to complete eight reps adequately, they will be given a thinner (lower) resistance band.As the same resistance band can provide varied tension depending on the tautness, participantsweretaughttoholdtheirresistancebandsinastraight line,withnoslackingorexcesspull,atthestartingpositionofeach exercise.For the ﬁrst 2 weeks of familiarization, participants used lightresistancebands,performingtwosetsof10–15repetitionsfor each of the six exercises.Exercises increased progressively, with adjustments occurring at weeks 2, 4, and 8.
At each progression check, only one component was increased, such as repetitions or adding an additional set. If participants reached three sets of 10 reps with the current resistance band, the resistance band was changed to the next higher resistance band with a reassessment of the number of reps and/or sets to be conducted.Participants achieved and maintained their individualized equivalent of 75– 80% of 1-RM throughout the rest of the intervention period and progressed to three sets of 8–10 repetitions for about 4 weeks before the intervention concluded.The resistance bands, length 2.0m×width150mm(ExerciseBand,TopGlove,Malaysia),have avariablethicknessof0.15–0.45mm(incrementsof0.05mm),and the maximal band thickness used by participants was 0.20mm, or the equivalent of 4.3–4.7 kgf at 300% extension (manufacturer’s information).
All exercise prescriptions and progressions were conductedinpersonandthenmonitoredthroughweeklyinquiries by the research team that checked on the completion of exercise and supplement intake based on the participants’ self-report for that week. During the weekly calls, participants were also asked to report any adverse events related to the prescribed exercise or nutritionalsupplement./two.tnum./five.tnum.Semi-structured interviews Upon completing the 12-week intervention, using a purposive sampling method, a total of 8 of the 16 participants participated in a semi-structured interview, achieving the data saturation concept.Data saturation was reached when the information from participants no longer oﬀered new insights and views that others had not mentioned ( 24).Each interview lasted approximately 30–40min using an interview guide ( Supplementarymaterial2 ).
Interviews were conducted over the phone at the participant’s convenienceasthiswasduringtheCOVID-19pandemiclockdown in Malaysia and face-to-face interviews were not possible. Interviews were recorded in a local Malay dialect, translated to English, and transcribed by the same trained research assistant.There were no pilots or repeat interviews.Our qualitative researcher counter-checked the translation and transcription and the ﬁeld notes made during the interviews.The NVivo software, version 12 (QSR International, Australia), was used by the Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org Vijayakumaran et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum/six.tnum/five.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum researcher to organize, explore, integrate, and ﬁnally interpret the data.
Thematic analysis using the six phases by Braun and Clarke (25) provided rigorous and trustworthy data analysis and interpretation. Data were presented according to emerging themes thatwerediscussedandagreeduponbytworesearchers.Qualitative reports were guided by the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitativeresearch(COREQ)checklist( 26)./two.tnum./six.tnum.Statistical analyses Statisticalanalysesofthequantitativemeasureswereconducted using SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 26 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).The data met the assumption of normality, and baseline group diﬀerences were assessed using an independent t-test.Mean group diﬀerences for the change (post-intervention minus baseline values) were generated and compared using an independent t-test.Within groups, changes were assessed using a paired t-test, and assumptions were checked and matched for the inferential statistical analyses.
Observed eﬀect sizes of paired samples (within-group) were calculated using unbiased Cohen’s d (post-intervention means minus baseline means, then divided by pooledstandarddeviationswithcorrection),withaninterpretation of the magnitude of dbased on the following: 0.20 “small eﬀect,” 0.50 “medium eﬀect,” and 0.8 “large eﬀect” ( 27). For the eﬀect size of the net diﬀerences (between groups), dwas calculated using the mean changes in PRT +WP minus the mean changes in PRT and divided by the pooled standard deviations of the respective means.Due to our modest sample size, the results and ﬁndings from the statistical analyses should be interpreted with caution.Statistical signiﬁcancewassetata p-valueof <0.05./three.tnum.Results /three.tnum./one.tnum.Study participants, attrition, and adherence A total of 320 older adults were screened for this study, of whom 18 were identiﬁed as having possible sarcopenia (one man).

They perceived themselves as lacking awareness and knowledge on nutrition for sarcopenia and healthy aging. This highlights that more needs to be done to advocate the beneﬁts and importance of high protein-based diets or supplements for older adults with sarcopenia.Some participants indicated that they were worriedthatitmightbesimilartopastexperiencesofingestingmilk andmilk-basedproducts,whichhadresultedinbloatingandother adverse reactions.However, their overall experience with regardto consuming the 100% whey-based supplemental drink was very positive, and they liked the taste and mouthfeel.There were no adverseeﬀectsofthesupplementbasedonself-reporteddata.More importantly, they stated that they did not experience the similar discomforts they had previously related to milk ingestion.They were ready to include the nutrition supplement in their daily diet astheyperceivedittobebeneﬁcialfortheirhealth.“Themilkwasverydelicious,andIwasfullafterconsuming it.
As a result, I did not snack much and was able to control my rice consumption. Both milk and exercise helped to improve the body.Ifeelhealthiernow!”(Participant3,68years) “Imixedthemilkwithchocolatepowderatﬁrstasnormally I get nauseated and bloated tummy if I drink milk.I was surprised it was not like other supplements.The taste was good, and I recommend this product.People like me should be advised todrinkthiseveryday.”(Participant7,64years) “I don’t drink milk much, but I started to take this supplement.It was delicious, and I can continue to drink it as therewerenosideeﬀects.”(Participant5,61years) /three.tnum./five.tnum./two.tnum.Theme /two.tnum: Sustaining behavior changes The readiness to change behavior was evident in various aspects discussed with the women.They wanted to change their behavior after learning about sarcopenia and experiencing the intervention.
In the long term, they want to improve their lifestyle by exercising and enhancing their knowledge and awareness on nutrition,physicalactivity,andsarcopenia.Theimpactofknowing thattheyweresarcopenicmayhaveinﬂuencedtheirperception,but they were keen to change their behavior related to health. A group or community-based approach rather than an individual approach was perceived as more successful in sustaining their behavior change.Women recruited into this study had responsibilities and routines at home that they were used to, but they willingly accommodatedthechangesaspartoftheintervention./three.tnum./five.tnum./two.tnum./one.tnum.Community-based program There was a preference for the training location to be somewhere where people with similar conditions could meet and exercise together, such as a community-based activity center.They were willing to allocate a certain time of the day to focus on exercising but preferred to attend a speciﬁc location to participate inagroupactivity.
“The exercise sessions must be oﬀered to others with the condition... sarcopenia.I felt more energetic and will be useful forothers.”(Participant4,66years) “Thereshouldbesimilarexercisesessionsforolderwomenin a hall or community center.I am happy to join and will ask my friendstojoin.Wewillenjoyexercisingtogether.”(Participant1, 72years) Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/seven.tnum frontiersin.org Vijayakumaran et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum/six.tnum/five.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum “The exercise sessions should be oﬀered beyond the research in groups.I would like to meet others and exercise together!” (Participant6,66years) /three.tnum./five.tnum./two.tnum./two.tnum.Guidance and awareness Women felt that there was a lack of information on exercise and nutrition for sarcopenia and older adults’ health in Malaysia.
They learned about nutrition as part of their involvement in the research but would like to have more information. Once they were diagnosed with sarcopenia, they valued greatly any information, especially on nutrition, to ensure their condition did not deteriorate.Dissemination of evidence-based information and guidelines through eﬀective platforms and channels is needed, especiallyforthisagegroupinMalaysia.“I did not know much about both exercising and nutrition beforejoiningtheresearch.”(Participant1,72years) “I would like to know about exercising, proper food and nutrition for my condition and age as there is not much info out there.”(Participant7,64years) “I would like some guidance on both nutrition and exercising, especially for my condition.
I want to feel better, and sureIwilltakecarebetterifIhavetheinformation.”(Participant 8,72years) “To be healthier long-term and beyond the research, more information will be valuable and much appreciated.” (Participant2,64years) /three.tnum./five.tnum./three.tnum. Theme /three.tnum: Challenges in participating Study participants highlighted several challenges in the prescribed exercises but perceived that the beneﬁts outweighed these challenges at the end of the intervention.Exercise itself was perceived as a barrier before the intervention.However, the challenges/barriers became their motivation to be more physicallyactive./three.tnum./five.tnum./three.tnum./one.tnum.Types of activities Certain exercises were challenging to some of the women: chest press, seated leg extensions, and squatting exercises were mentioned.
However, self-determination was observed as there were many situations where the exercises were diﬃcult, but all the participants continued and completed most of their prescribed program successfully. At times, they reduced the exercise repetitions but did not stop the exercises.In terms of perceived beneﬁts, how they felt both physically and emotionally upon completing the activities was the main reason for their strong commitments.They felt ﬁtter, were able to move more, felt stronger, and were more conﬁdent in doing their dailyactivities.“Someexercises,suchasthecheststrengthening,wasdiﬃcult atthestart,butIsloweddownatﬁrstandlatercontinuedasIwas abletodomore,feltlesspain.”(Participant5,61years) “It was diﬃcult to do the squatting exercise.I stopped when it was painful, but by end of the study, I was able to do it!
Felt reallyhappy!”(Participant6,66years) “The chest strengthening was not easy for me, but others wererelativelyeasy.Itookmorebreaksinbetweenbutmadesure Icompletedtheexercises.”(Participant4,66years) “I felt my muscles were stronger after exercising, and I was abletodomyactivitieslikewalkingandhouseholdworkbetter.” (Participant1,72years) /three.tnum./five.tnum./three.tnum./two.tnum. Lifestyle and commitments Lack of time or their current lifestyle was a concern before they started, but they were willing to change their lifestyle to accommodate the activities prescribed during the intervention.This was attributed to their fewer responsibilities due to their age and role at home (retired, not much work to do at home, and no childcare tasks).Therefore, they had a high level of commitment and included the exercises in their usual routine.Participants understood that behavior change was one of the key elements to ensure the sustainability of their actions, especially in the long term.
Focusing on activities that emphasize healthy aging was welcomed and appreciated. However, it was not clear and remains to be investigated if the participants continued to exercise beyond theintervention.“I allocated a speciﬁc time in the morning and evening, approximately 30–40min.I was able to commit as I don’t have many responsibilities and work around the house.” (Participant 7,64years) “IusuallysetatimeaftertheAsarprayersforabout30min.The timing worked as I exercised after my daily prayer time.I hadaroutinethatworkedforme”.(Participant6,66years) /three.tnum./five.tnum./four.tnum.Theme /four.tnum: Wellbeing All participants wanted to continue with the intervention (exercise and consume the supplement).Improved quality of life and positive emotions were often described as favorable outcomes oftheintervention./three.tnum./five.tnum./four.tnum./one.tnum.
Emotional wellbeing Negative emotions such as nervousness, anxiety, lack of conﬁdence, and worry were common thoughts experienced by the women before the intervention. Perceived risk and discomfort were also sources of negative emotions prior to starting the intervention.However, with supervision and guidance from the researchteam,theyweremoreconﬁdentandwereabletoadhereto the intervention.The perceived beneﬁts were the main motivation Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/eight.tnum frontiersin.org Vijayakumaran et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum/six.tnum/five.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum as mentioned in other themes.Participants indicated that they were happier, cheerful, and satisﬁed, and had a more positive outlook on health, especially by the end of the intervention.
Their feelings were attributed to the overall intervention and were not speciﬁc to either physical activities or supplementation. Positive emotionsexperiencedalsoincludedimprovementsinqualityoflife and mental health.Emotions are not easily recognized or widely discussed,buttheywereevidentinthisstudy.“I was doubtful of myself...whether I can do the exercises, butnowIamveryhappyandconﬁdent(laughed)!”(Participant 2,64years) “Feeling happier and cheerful every day.I feel grateful for beingapartofthisresearch.”(Participant3,68years) “Before I started, I was quite nervous, mainly because I feared getting hurt.However, I was given adequate guidance on how to carry out the exercise.I am glad I took part, feeling more energetic every day now and feel blessed.” (Participant 7, 64years) “Iammorepositivenow,veryhappy...maybebecauseIam moreactive(laughed).”(Participant8,72years) /three.tnum./five.tnum./four.tnum./two.tnum.
Improved quality of life The overall perception of the intervention was positive as they expected and experienced an improved quality of life. They were more active physically, experienced less pain, and generally felt more positive about their health.All women commented on the improvedqualityoflifeduetotheintervention.Theirperceptionof qualityoflifewassubjectivebutlikelyattributedtobeingphysically activeandlearningnewskills(exercising).“Thesetypesofactivitiesshouldbeprovidedtootherstoo!It hasimprovedhowIwork!”(Participant1,72years) “I have a better outlook of my life.I can move around more withoutpain.Iamlivingbetter.”(Participant3,68years) “Ifeelthestudyisverygood.Ithadapositiveimpactonmy life,suchprogrammustcontinue!”(Participant4,66years) /four.tnum.Discussion In this study of older sarcopenic Malay women, resistance training (with and without whey-protein-based nutritional supplementation) was associated with many positive perceptive and physical beneﬁts.
First, the home-based, high-intensity resistance training program was shown to be safe and eﬀective to optimize muscle health (and even reversing sarcopenia) in older sarcopenic adults. Second, the following four main themes relatedtocommencingandparticipatinginamulti-modalexercise and nutrition intervention emerged: (1) perceived beneﬁts, (2)sustaining behavior changes, (3) challenges in participating, and (4) improved wellbeing that supports the continuation of the exercise and nutrition supplementation.Sub-themes such as better physical functioning and perceived beneﬁts of the nutritional supplementation indicated the positive impact of the intervention, while sub-themes such as preference for community-based programs and being guided and given awareness highlighted their intention to continue with such activities.Challenging activities and how they overcome them were also shared, which are important to inform future implementation.
Third, through the interviews, participants’ emotional experiences started with fearfulness and doubt about their ability to conduct PRT and consume the WP supplement, but having no adverse eﬀects from both components, the emotions were replaced by a strong sense of achievementfollowingthecompletionoftheintervention. Previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have shown regular exercise, particularly PRT, or exercise plus nutrition approaches, are eﬀective for improving muscle mass, strength, and performance in older adults with sarcopenia ( 13,14).Our intervention was eﬀective in improving muscle strength in both groups, but there were no signiﬁcant changes in muscle mass.Participants reported completing most of their exercise sessions as we had the COVID-19 pandemic movement control order in Malaysia occur early in the intervention and had to revert to letting participants exercise at home.
Participants mainly came to our campus to revise their exercise prescriptions based on their progress and to obtain WP supplementation thereafter. Since the number of enrolled and completed participants in this study was small ( n=16), the gains in muscle strength and changes in sarcopenia criterion may be considered case-study ﬁndings.Signiﬁcant muscle strength changes were seen for handgrip values in both groups, and this may be attributed to the action of holding the resistance bands in a grip-like manner.Stair ascent time improved signiﬁcantly by 0.8–1.0s in both groups and 5-STS time by 1.3–2.0s, which was signiﬁcant for the PRT group.Thus, other than knowing which type of exercise works for sarcopenic older adults, participants’ insights on how it may have worked for them arekeytoimplementation.Lack of knowledge on the health beneﬁts of nutrition and exercise in older adults was a barrier to participation, as identiﬁed in a sarcopenia-related study ( 29).
This was also evident in this studywhereparticipantsidentiﬁedtheinterventionasapreventive measure on top of managing sarcopenia. Participants wanted more guidelines and information on nutrition and recommended exercises to prevent or treat sarcopenia to be disseminated to them andtheircommunity.Informationdisseminationandawarenessof sarcopeniaarevital,andthisincludeshavingthemedicalfraternity beabletoidentifysarcopeniaintheirolderpatients( 30).However, it remains to be explored how such information can be shared eﬀectively and more widely.Future research could consider using digital tools and platforms and educating medical and health professionals about the importance of screening and diagnosing sarcopenia and how it can be treated.Another possible strategy is to apply implementation research or knowledge-translation study designs to assess the delivery of eﬀective, scientiﬁc ﬁndings to the targetedcommunity( 31).
Reasons for non-participation in physical activity and exercise commonly include sociodemographic factors, including ethnicity, education level, and employment status ( 17). However, women Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/nine.tnum frontiersin.org Vijayakumaran et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum/six.tnum/five.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum in our study did not refer to their sociodemographic background as the main reason for not being physically active prior to participating in the research.Rather, it was the knowledge of their muscleconditionorability,i.e.,sarcopenia,thatlargelydetermined theirparticipation.Correspondingly,theyfocusedontheperceived beneﬁtsthatwereachievablefromparticipatingintheintervention.
Other concerns regarding participating in the exercise include lack of conﬁdence and fear of falling or getting hurt, which are very real and are associated with less independent mobility and increasedfrailtyinolderadults( 32,33)andthiswasechoedbyour participants. However, participants in this study were motivated to complete the intervention because they experienced positive change and felt better physically.Quantitatively, the change in stair ascent time was statistically signiﬁcant and is not a criterion in sarcopenia but may be reﬂective of how these women feel after the intervention period as they could climb up the stairs at a faster pace.These self-reported improvements or patient- reported outcomes described the context of meaningful change that may be more relevant to people with sarcopenia ( 34).
Overall reasons for participating and continuing with the intervention echoed the Health Belief Model along with other health behavior and social cognitive theories ( 35), where health motivation and perceived beneﬁts (professional-guided PRT and suitable nutrition supplement)supersededtheirperceivedbarriers(fearsanddoubts) in managing sarcopenia. Through this study, we could see that we have unintentionally addressed components within behavioral change models to witness the change in participants’ physical activitylevels.Both physical activity and nutrition are crucial in maintaining skeletal muscle mass and function in older adults ( 13,14,36).There is increasing research recognizing the critical role of increased dietary protein or protein supplements in combination with physical activity to prevent sarcopenia ( 37–40).
Although milk consumption among older adults in Malaysia is considered uncommon ( 41), the high-protein whey-based supplement drink usedinthisstudywaswellacceptedduetoitstasteandlimitedside eﬀects. Although there were no diﬀerences between PRT +WP and PRT groups, which is likely due to the small sample size, we also did not account for habitual dietary intake in this study and could not establish if either group had suﬃcient or inadequate nutrient intake.However, the MNA scores improved in the PRT +WP group, which also had more participants within the at-risk of malnutritioncategoryatbaseline.However,duetothesmallsample numbers, these ﬁndings are case-study-level evidence at best.The main messages from the personal perceptions of the participants were that: (1) the compliance with the nutritional supplement in this study was high (90%) and (2) the women enjoyed consuming the drink, which suggests that such an approach can be used to increase protein intake in older Malay women.
Older adults can be encouraged to try whey-based products as an alternative to whole- milk products to minimize unpleasant experiences with normal milk intake and thus add good-quality proteins and nutrients to theirdiet. Participants in this research who completed their exercise program at home indicated that they would prefer to attend a group-based, community program rather than exercising entirely by themselves at home, but they did not discuss any potential barriers or support needed to attend such programs.Barriers to attending a community-based programshould be a focus area in future research as factors such as aﬀordability and costs related to fees for exercise professionals to conduct programs were barriers to attending exercise sessions in several previous interventions ( 42,43).However, research elucidating the types of exercise interventions for older adults remains inconclusive as the setting (clinical vs.community vs.
home-based), qualiﬁed professional supervision, multimodal programcomponents,orevengroupvs.individual-basedprogram components inﬂuence long-term adherence, sustainability, and preferences across diﬀerent populations ( 44). Researchers have highlighted the social aspect of a group program as a powerful driver for adherence and future continuation of being physically active (44), which is consistent with some of the ﬁndings from ourstudy.Other than health beneﬁts, engagement in physical activity in older adults stemmed from feelings of being included; social engagement and being part of something that is accessible were major components as addressed by older adults in the literature ( 45).Our participants highlighted their preference to continue the PRT and WP programs in a community-based setting that evokes a similar sense of inclusiveness and social bonding through the activity.
More speciﬁcally, participants were willing to allocate speciﬁc time to exercise and were motivated to continue with the exercises beyond the intervention. In this study, words such as “happy,” “blessed,” and “excited” were used to describe how they felt and were associated with how they perceivedimprovementstotheirphysicalhealth.Positiveemotions can be enhanced and sustained by focusing on community- based physical activities as previous research has shown that community settings result in the enjoyment of physical exercises and positive emotions from the consequences of social networking (38).Participants’ eagerness and motivation to engage were also evident in our study, which is crucial to ensure sustained engagement( 46).Sustained participation is related to having the opportunity to form social bonds and working closely with peers that will encourage and motivate one another ( 29), which was also mentioned by our participants.
One study reported that some ethnicgroupsoftenfocusonculturalsensitivity;forexample,some Muslim women would not exercise in groups with men due to religiouspracticesrequiringgendersegregation( 42).However,this was not highlighted as an issue in our study, despite the fact that all were Muslim women. There is an interest in gender-speciﬁc diﬀerences in the development of sarcopenia ( 29), and although participantswereverykeentochangetheirbehaviortobehealthier with the strong advocation for structured exercise sessions, our study is limited to views from women only as no men participated inthisstudy.EncouragedbytheﬁndingsfromthispilottrialofthePRTand WP interventions that were both quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, a more comprehensive implementation type of research is required.Note that our study results were limited to views and physiological responses from a small all-women cohort, and the results should be interpreted with caution.
Furthermore, during the study, we had challenges with access and logistics due to the COVID-19 movement control orders in Malaysia which may have reduced our eﬃciency to eﬀectively monitor and determine compliance with all the PRT sessions and supplementation intake. However, physical changes were evident, and participants would Frontiersin Nutrition /one.tnum/zero.tnum frontiersin.org Vijayakumaran et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum/six.tnum/five.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum meet to assess progression, change exercise bands, and receive the next dose of the whey protein supplementation.Although we monitored participants via weekly phone calls, there may be self-report biases as one individual deteriorated to severe sarcopenia despite reporting completing the prescribed exercises and supplementation.
Furthermore, our study only included one ethnicity (Malays) in Malaysia, and thus, future research should include multiple populations and settings to capture a more inclusive perception. Finally, the study design was geographically restricted to Malaysia’s East Coast, but the methods can be replicatedelsewheretoincludewidersociodemographicfactorsand ultimately capture the views of the culturally diverse population inMalaysia./five.tnum.Conclusion In this study of older Malay women with sarcopenia, the overall physical outcomes were encouraging, and the experiences reﬂected upon by the women completing the 12 weeks of exercise and nutrition intervention were positive, with valuable recommendations to inform future interventions and in designing prevention activities within a community setting, especially in Malaysia.
While the women were initially skeptical and fearful of participating in a multi-faceted exercise and nutrition program, they reported a positive experience following the intervention due to the perceived physical and mental health beneﬁts. The changes they made to their lifestyle for 12 weeks as part of the intervention weresomethingthattheywerewillingtosustainintheirdailylives with adequate support and guidance.However, to facilitate future implementation and participation, women indicated they want moremulti-modelexercises,nutritionguidance,andprogramsthat are incorporated into community-based settings.Collectively, the ﬁndings from this study indicated that engagement in physical activities and subsequently preventing sarcopenia among older adults can be successful with the right support, facilities, and guidance that can be investigated within an implementation researchdesign.
