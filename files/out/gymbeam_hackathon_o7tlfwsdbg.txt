The aim of this study was toexamine the effect of short-term Mg supplementation oniron status in healthy female participants. Methods: One hundred healthy female students of the University of Belgrade - Faculty of Pharmacy participated the study during eleven intervention days.Students ingested Mgpreparations with the same dose of the active substance.Theanalysis included the measurement of serum iron, unsaturat-ed iron binding capacity (UIBC), total iron binding capacity(TIBC), total Mg (tMg), ionized Mg (iMg), complete blood count, met-, carboxy- and oxy-haemoglobin (metHgb, COHgb, O 2Hgb).T ransferrin concentrations and percentage of transferrin saturation (SAT) were calculated manually.Theassociation among the analyzed biochemical parameters wasexamined using polynomial regression.A principal compo-nent analysis (PCA) was used for the evaluation of interde-pendence between the analyzed parameters.
Results: A statistically significant trend for change in O2Hgb (%) by tertiles of iMg concentrations was found (P = 0.029).Serum tMg reached significant positive correlation with the SAT at concentration levels greater than 0.9 mmol/L, after 11 days of intervention (R 2=0.116). Ionized Mg in a con- centration higher than 0.6 mmol/L is positively correlatedwith SAT and serum Fe (R 2=0.214; 0.199, respectively).Kratak sadr`aj Uvod:Literaturni podaci ukazuju na benefit suplementacije magnezijumom (Mg).Cilj ove studije bio je da se ispita uticajkratkotrajne suplementacije Mg na status gvo`|a kod zdravih`ena.Metode:Sto zdravih studentkinja Univerzitet u Beogradu – Farmaceutskog fakulteta je u~estvovalo u istra`ivanju tokom jedanaest dana intervencije.Studenti su uzimali preparateMg sa istom dozom aktivne supstance.

J Med Biochem 2022; 41 (3) 317 Introduction Magnesium (Mg) plays an important role in many physiological functions. As a cofactor for over600 enzymes and an activator of an additional 200enzymes, Mg is involved in almost all major biochem-ical and metabolic processes in the body.Magnesiumhas an important role in macronutrient and energymetabolism, neuromuscular function, bone develop-ment, cell proliferation and signalling pathways (1, 2).Magnesium is an essential micronutrient, and there-fore it must be supplied regularly via food sources toreach the recommended intake and prevent deficien-cy.Insufficient dietary intake of Mg is one of the mostimportant causes of hypomagnesaemia (3).Re com - mendations for Mg intake for adults in the UnitedStates (Recommended Daily Allowances, RDA) are320 mg/day for women and 420 mg/day for menand in Europe 300 mg/day for women and 350mg/day for men (Dietary Reference Values, DRVs) (4,5).
Although Mg is widely distributed in plant and ani-mal foods as well as in beverages, literature data indi-cate that the dietary intake of Mg is below the recom-mended levels in a large percentage of European andUS populations where there is a higher prevalence ofthe Western dietary pattern (6–9). There is also evi- dence that many young women in various European countries and in the US fail to achieve these recom-mended intakes (2, 10).Furthermore, epidemiologi-cal studies have shown that people who follow aWestern-style diet, characterized by a high intake ofprocessed foods, have an inadequate intake of severalmicronutrients, with dietary Mg intake of less than30–50% of RDA (11, 12).In recent decades, insufficient Mg intake and consequent hypomagnesaemia have been associatedwith several cardiovascular conditions, includinghypertension, an increased risk of glucose intoler-ance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (1–3,13).
Moreover, a meta-analysis of eight prospectivecohort studies has reported a significant inverse asso-ciation between Mg intake and risk of type 2 diabetes in a dose-response manner (14). In addition, Mg defi-ciency is closely related to the development of anaemia (15, 16).There is accumulating research regarding the importance and modalities for achieving adequateMg intake.Magnesium supplementation may be agood strategy for preventing deficiency and prevent-ing associated diseases, when the recommended daily intake cannot be provided solely by the diet (1–3, 13).According to the recently conducted survey,Mg supplements were among ten most populardietary supplements used in adult population (17).Magne sium supplementation led to improved anemia in thalassemic mice and improved erythrocyte mem-brane transport abnormalities in patients with sicklecell disease (18, 19), while in athletes, Mg supple-mentation increased erythrocyte count and hae - moglobin levels (20).
Moreover, according to the Shiet al. (16) Mg supplementation may be a safer alter-native than iron (Fe) supplementation in the preven-tion of anemia.Although previously published data suggest the beneficial effects of increased Mg intake on Fe statusamong anaemic individuals, research on this issue islacking for the non-anaemic population (15, 16).It isgenerally accepted that the female population is moreprone to Fe deficiency anemia and more vulnerableon Fe status than men (21, 22).Therefore, it isimportant to ensure stable Fe status, particularly inthe reproductive period of life.The aim of this studywas to examine the effect of short-term Mg supple-mentation in doses of 375 mg corresponding to the 100% of Mg Nutritive Referent Value NRV on Fe sta- tus in healthy female participants.
Materials and Methods Ethics statementThis study was conducted following the guide- lines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and thestudy protocols were approved by the EthicsCommission of the University of Belgrade - Faculty ofPharmacy, Belgrade, Serbia (approval number:188/2, 2020). All subjects went through verbal andwritten consent processes.Study design and subjects One hundred healthy female students of the University of Belgrade – Faculty of Pharmacy agreedto participate in this study.Eligible students wereapproached in the Faculty setting.Recruitmentbrochure contained detailed information regardingthe purpose of the study, procedures involved as wellPCA revealed variability of 64.7% for two axes after 11 days.Conclusions:Mg supplementation leads to an improvement in the certain iron status parameters even in individuals withoptimal levels of these indices.
However, caution should beexercised when supplementing Mg, and laboratory monitor-ing of the interaction is required.

The studydid not include students who had altered Fe status(primarily based on complete blood count analysis),who had taken Mg supplements over the previousthree months, or students who had confirmed chronickidney and/or gastrointestinal tract disease. Finally, after applying the exclusion criteria, 46 respondents remained in the analytical sample.Anthropometric parameters were measured at the beginning of the study.Height was measured tothe nearest 0.1 cm (Perspective Enterprises,Kalamazoo, MI, USA).Body weight and body fat per-centage were determined using the bioimpedancemethod (BC-418MA, T anita, USA).Body Mass Index(BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) / height 2(m2).During eleven intervention days, students ingested Mg preparations (citrate, oxide and carbon-ate) with the same dose of the active substance (375 mg/day).The subjects were randomly assigned tothree groups according to the form of the Mg prepa-ration.
Dietary intake assessment Dietary intake data was collected via partici- pants’ subjective retrospective reports in two studypoints. Participants were administered 24h dietaryrecalls on two consecutive days before the initiation ofthe supplementation (t0) and after 11 days of usingthe provided Mg supplements, within the follow-upassessment (t2).Dietary information and relevant contextual data were obtained over the course of face-to-face structured interviews led by a trainedresearcher.In order to improve the accuracy of thereport, enhance participants’ memory, and assure theprovision of detailed descriptions of consumed itemsmultiple-pass methodological approach was applied.T o assist respondents in portion size quantificationinterviewers used validated, 135-item Food Atlas fea- turing coloured photographs of increasing portionsizes for a selection of Balkan region-specific simplefoods and composite dishes (23).
Additionally, sub-jects reported quantities of foods consumed based onstandardized household measures, natural units and labelling information for packaged products. DietAssess & Plan – original software-based platform for comprehensive nutritional assessment was applied inquestionnaire processing (24).Subsequent conver-sion of food consumption information into energy and nutrient intake estimates was performed accord-ing to data compiled in National Serbian FoodComposition Database (25).Age and gender-adjust-ed nutritional recommendations proposed by EFSAi.e., Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) were applied for micronutrient adequacy evaluation (26).Biochemical assessment Serum biochemical parameters were analyzed before the initiation of the intervention, at baseline(t0), on the fifth day (t1) and the eleventh day (t2) ofthe intervention period.Blood samples were collectedby professional phlebotomists via venipuncturebetween 7:00 am and 9:00 am.
All studied partici-pants were donated blood samples after the 12h ofovernight fast. Standard operating procedures forblood collection and sample preparation were fol-lowed (27).A closed venipuncture system, BecktonDickinson (BD) 22 Standard Wire Gauge (SWG), areusable adapter and vacutainers were used.Vacutainers with clot activator (BD Vacutainer® SST™T ubes) were used to obtain serum samples.Serumsamples were used for measurement of serum Fe,unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), total ironbinding capacity (TIBC) and total Mg (tMg).T ransferrin concentrations and percentage of transfer-rin saturation (SAT) were calculated according to theformula proposed by Dacie et al.(28).Completeblood count was determined using the whole bloodsamples collected in a tube with liquid anticoagulant(ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, EDTA) (BDVacutainer® EDTA T ubes).
For the analyses of met-,carboxy- and oxy-haemoglobin (metHgb, COHgb,O 2Hgb) and ionized Mg (iMg), lithium-heparin spray- coated tube (BD Vacutainer® Heparin T ubes) wereused. Serum Fe, UIBC, TIBC and tMg concentrationswere measured using the spectrophotometric methodwith commercial reagents, on Olympus AU400 bio-chemical analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., California, USA).Complete blood count was measured in whole blood samples using electrical impedance on CoulterAc•T diff Hematology Analyzer (Beckman Coulter,Inc., California, USA).T otal haemoglobin (tHgb) con-centrations were measured by spectrophotometry onCoulter Ac•T diff Hematology Analyzer.MetHgb,COHgb, O 2Hgb and iMg were determined approxi- mately up to 60 min after collection using Stat ProfilePrime Plus Critical Care blood gas analyzer (NovaBiomedical, USA).The precision and accuracy of themethods were verified using commercial control sam-ples for all the listed parameters.
Statistical analysis The normality of the data distribution was anal- ysed using the One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnovtest. Normally distributed data were presented asmean and standard deviation (SD).Non-normally dis-tributed data were presented as a median andinterquartile range (IQR), by subtracting the first fromthe third quartile of the distribution.For data thatwere not normally distributed, values were log-trans- formed before analysis.Linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between inves-tigated parameters.The association among serum Feand Mg (as tMg, iMg and iMg/tMg) with certain(some) biochemical parameters was presented aspolynomial regression.A principal component analy-sis (PCA) was used for the evaluation of interdepen-dence between serum Fe and Mg (as tMg, iMg andiMg/tMg) and biochemical parameters (UIBC, TIBC,T ransferrin, tHgb, hematocrit, SAT and Fe).
We haveconsidered p-value < 0.05 as statistically significant.All statistical analyses were performed using IBMSPSS version 24 (SPSS Inc., USA). Results Baseline participants’ characteristics are pre- sented in T able I .Participants were on average 23 years old, with a BMI of 21.8 kg/m 2.Erythrocyte indices and biochemical parameters indicated afavourable Fe status.All presented parameters werewithin the reference values routinely used in the lab-oratory, and recommended by the test manufacturer.Given that the aim of this study was to examine theeffect of the applied dose of magnesium of 375 mg,in which magnesium is most often found in dietarysupplements on the Serbian market (dose that meets100% nutritional reference value for Mg), data wasfurther analysed without partition of subjects into subcohorts in relation to different types of supplementedmagnesium (citrate, oxide and carbonate).Estimated daily energy and nutrient intakes are presented in T able II .
Based on the average of dietary recalls for two consecutive days at baseline evaluation(t0) and after 11 days (t2) of using provided dietarysupplements, the results obtained indicate that foodintake did not change over time. Estimated intake levels of eight food groups and their corresponding contributions to daily iron intake based on repeated 24 h dietary recalls are presented in T able III .Dominant Fe dietary sources were grains and cereal products (28.6%), meat and meat prod-ucts (22.3%) and vegetables and vegetable products(15.7%).A statistically significant trend for change in O 2Hgb (%) by tertiles of whole blood iMg concentra- tions was found.With the increase of iMg, the per- centage of O2Hgb decreases.Additionally, we found a significant increase in changes of SAT (%) by quar-tile until the third quartile of tMg values.Interestingly,in the fourth quartile of serum tMg values, a signifi-cant decrease in SAT (%) was observed.
Based on polynomial regression analyses, serum tMg reached significant positive correlation with theSAT at concentration levels greater than 0.9 mmol/L,after 11 days of supplementary intervention(R 2=0.116; Figure 1B ). Before the intervention, therewas no statistically significant correlation between serum tMg and SAT ( Figure 1A ).Ionized Mg in a concentration higher than 0.6 mmol/L is positivelycorrelated with SAT and serum Fe (R 2=0.214; 0.199, respectively; Figure 2B ) after supplementation, which was not the case before the supplementation, becauseat the mentioned concentration the serum Fedecreased slightly ( Figure 2A ).J Med Biochem 2022; 41 (3) 319 Table I Baseline participant characteristics (N=46).

PCA is a factormodel in which the factors are based on summarizingthe total variance. The first two factors should corre-spond to a high % of the variance to ensure that themaps based on the first two factors are a good qualityprojection of the initial multi-dimensional table.Atthe beginning of the experiment, PCA revealed thattwo axes participated in total variability with 55.8% (F1: 34.6% and F2: 21.2%), and after 11 days, theaxes participated in total variability with 64.7% (F1:46.7% and F2: 18.0%).
According to the PCA,T ransferrin, TIBC, UIBC, SAT , iMg/tMg and iMg cor-related mainly with the first axis - factor (0.952;0.952; 0.940; -0.607; -0.579 and -0.520, respec-tively), while serum Fe, tHgb, SAT , Mg; hematocrit;iMg/tMg, and MetHgb were mainly connected to thesecond axis - factor (0.758; 0.721; 0.588; 0.442;J Med Biochem 2022; 41 (3) 321 Figure 1 Interdependence between serum total magnesium (tMg) with serum iron (Fe),unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation (SAT) at the beginning (A) and after 11 days (B) of sup-plementary intervention. 322 Milinkovi} et al.: Magnesium supplementation and iron status 0.317; -0.554; -0.510; respectively), Figure 4A .In the first factor (F1) there is a strong positive correla- tion between TIBC, UIBC and T ransferrin, while SAT ,iMg/tMg and iMg are negatively correlated.
Thesecond factor (F2) is positively correlated with serumFe, tHgb, SAT , serum Mg; hematocrit, and negativelywith iMg/tMg, and MetHgb. After 11 days of thestudy, F1 was determined with UIBC, TIBC, T rans - ferrin; SAT; serum Fe; tHgb and hematocrit (-0.982,-0.890, -0.890, 0.890, 0.822, 0.777, and 0.698, respectively), whereas F2 was determined with iMg/tMg; iMg and serum Mg (0.981; 0.720 and -0.616; respectively), Figure 4B .The first factor (F1) is positively correlated with SAT; serum Fe; tHgb andhematocrit, and negatively with UIBC, TIBC andT ransferrin, while second factor (F2) is positivelycorrelated with iMg/tMg and iMg, and negatively withserum tMg.Figure 2 Interdependence between serum ionized magnesium (iMg) with serum iron (Fe), hematocrit (Hct), transferrin and transferrin saturation (SAT) at the beginning (A) and after 11 days (B) of supplementary intervention.
J Med Biochem 2022; 41 (3) 323 Discussion T o the best of our knowledge this is the first study examining the short-term effects of Mg supple- mentation in daily doses corresponding to 100% NRVon Fe status in young healthy women. Intervention study was conducted among young female subjectswith an aim to explore the effects of short-term Mgsupplementation on indices of iron status.Namely,the literature data indicate that the human bodyadapts to the additional intake of magnesium, calci- um and phosphorus in the period from 7 to 10 daysand that the mineral balance is achieved in the periodof a few days after supplementation intake (29).After 11 days of supplementation in a dose corresponding to Mg DRV (i.e.375 mg), direct association wasfound between the serum tMg concentration andSAT .Furthermore, whole blood iMg correlated posi-tively with SAT and serum Fe.
These observationsFigure 3 Principal Component Analysis for serum iron (Fe) and serum magnesum (Mg) (as total (tMg), ionized (iMg) and iMg/Mg) and biochemical parameters (unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin,transferrin saturation (SAT), total haemoglobin (tHgb), MetHgb and hematocrit (Hct)) content at the beginning (A, t0) andafter 11 days (B, t2) of supplementary intervention. 324 Milinkovi} et al.: Magnesium supplementation and iron status were also confirmed by polynomial regression.These finding suggest that Mg supplementation andincreased Mg levels, both serum tMg and blood iMg,might exert beneficial impact on obtaining favorableFe status among young female population.In this sample, the average iron intake was sig- nificantelly bellow the DRI and DRV for women, i.e.,18 mg/day and 16 mg/day, respectively (4, 5).
Thesefindings are consistent with the results of other stud-ies which reported dietary iron intake in women ofreproductive age in Europe (30, 31). Regardless thesuboptimal dietary intake of Fe, biomarkers of Fe sta-tus were within the normal range.This can beexplained by the following facts: iron metabolism wasprimarily regulated at the level of absorption, and theexamined population did not have gastrointestinaldisorders.Also, the amount of iron that enters thebody from food is regulated by the body’s need foriron.Other studies also indicate that a significant pro-portion of the UK population has Fe intake below rec-ommendations and a low prevalence of poor Fe sta-tus (32–34).This might be because there areimportant uncertainties in the DRVs for Fe intakewhich may be too high, particularly for girls andwomen of reproductive age.It is recommended thatthe DRVs for iron should be reviewed when moredata becomes available.
Good quality dose-response data are required to enable a reassessment of the DRVs for iron. Knowledge of the systemic regulationand mediation of iron homeostasis should be appliedto characterize better the responses to increased andreduced systemic needs for Fe and development, orbetter validation, of existing markers used to assessthe adequacy of Fe status in populations and individ-uals.The main food sources of Fe among participantsin our study were grains and cereal products with con-tribution of more than a quarter of total dietary intakeof this nutrient followed by meat and meat productsand vegetables.These three food groups togethercontributed to 65% of estimated iron intake in theparticipants.These observations are in accordancewith previously published data for European popula-tion (35, 36).
Furthermore, dietary intake assessmentrevealed that Mg intake among female student popu- lation were also below the recommended level although mean baseline tMg concentration was ade-quate. There is a lack of literature data regarding the effect of increased Mg intake on Fe status in youngwomen in the reproductive period.This issue needs tobe addressed taking into account that Mg supple-ments are one of the most popular dietary supple-ments used in adult population (17) and the fact thatanemia is most prevalent among females of child-bearing age (36).In this study, we tried to explore the connection between serum Fe and serum Mg (as tMg, iMg andiMg/Mg) and other biochemical indices of Fe statususing the PCA approach, before and after Mg supple- mentation.Given that the diet did not change overintervention period intake of Mg and Fe were not con-sidered in PCA.
At the beginning of the study, beforethe initiation of the supplementation, there was astrong positive correlation between UIBC, TIBC andtransferrin, but after 11 days of supplementation wefound a strong negative correlation among the sameanalyzed parameters. Analyses revealed that even in ashort period of intervention there is a noticeableeffect of Mg supplementation on Fe status para - meters (serum Fe, tHgb, hematocrit).PCA analysisrevealed a positive correlation between serum Fe andSAT after 11 days of supplementation.Reddy et al.have explained similiar associations in Fe statusparameters but in patients with functional anemia inchronic kidney disease (37).Anemia could be presentas a latent condition, mostly in young women who arein the reproductive period.In order to optimize Festatus it is important to monitor biochemicalparameters and routinely examine relevant markers(38).
Previously published data suggest an interaction between the resorption of divalent cations such as Mgand Fe. Namely, the deficiency of one divalent cationin the intestine can lead to increased resorption ofother divalent cations (39).In an animal model, it hasbeen shown that Fe deficiency can lead to increase inintestinal absorption of Mg, calcium and phosphorussince the same receptor may be involved in the resorption of these chemically similar cations (40).Low dietary intake of Mg in rats has been shown toincrease Fe resorption (41).Furthermore, in vitro studies have demonstrated that Mg salts can nega-tively affect absorption of Fe by raising the pH valueas the availability of Fe salts in the intestinal tract ispH dependent (42).Moreover, certain Mg salts canabsorb Fe and thus interact with its absorption (42).On the contrary, there are studies linking Mg intake and the risk of developing anemia (15, 16, 42–44).
In our study, we have demonstrated that shortterm supplementation with Mg and increased level ofserum tMg and iMg could have benefical effects on %SAT and serum Fe. Magnesium is a cofactor of alarge number of enzymes, with an important role inthe synthesis of hemoglobin.Accordingly, Mg defi- ciency can interrupt hemoglobin synthesis and ery- throcyte energy metabolism and result in anemia.Inaddition, Mg deficiency has been reported to be asso-ciated with an inflammatory process, which couldlead to anemia (45).Therefore, the question arises asto whether Mg supplementation is required in personswho are not deficient in this trace element, and leavesspace to the future studies to examine longitudinal effects of Mg supplementation on Fe status indices.The key limitation of the present study is missing data regarding the leukocyte, thrombocyte, and ery-throcyte counts as well as ferritin level, after the inter- J Med Biochem 2022; 41 (3) 325 References 1.

Additionally, the analyzed parameterswere significantly correlated, and after the interven-tion period, a significant positive association amongthe analyzed parameters was achieved. However, cau- tion should be exercised when supplementing Mg,and laboratory monitoring of the interaction isrequired.Further research is warranted regarding thepossible impact of the forms of Mg preparations thatexist on the market, and whether they equally affectbiochemical changes of iron status in healthy youngpeople as well as in specific target groups of patients.Acknowledgements .This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and T echnological Development of Serbia on the basis of contractNo.175036 and No.451-03-68/2020-14/200161.Conflict of interest statement All the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest in this work.326 Milinkovi} et al.: Magnesium supplementation and iron status model of b-thalassemia.
