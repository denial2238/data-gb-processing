Whether folic acid (FA) causes an increase in MMA is not known. Objectives: We aimed to determine the impact of FA supplementation on plasma MMA concentration in people with low or marginal serum vitamin B-12.Methods: We conducted a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of oral FA (5 mg/d for 12 wk) in middle-aged patients treated with antidepressant medication participating in the FoLATED (Folate Augmentation ofTreatment—EvaluationforDepression)trial.Participantsdefinedashaving“low”serumvitaminB-12(vitaminB-12 ≥150 and <220 ng/L) or “marginal” serum vitamin B-12 (vitamin B-12 ≥220 and <280 ng/L) were included.The primary outcome of this substudy was MMA at week 12.A mixed-effects linear regression was fitted and reported using theadjusted mean difference (aMD).Results: A total of 177 participants were included (85 randomly assigned to placebo and 92 to FA); the mean ±SD age was 46.2 ±11.8 y, and 112 (63.3%) were female.
The MMA analysis included 135 participants and the aMD was −0.01 (95% CI: −0.06, 0.04; P=0.71). Serum folate was measured on 166 participants and increased in the supplementation group; the aMD was 21.6 μg/L (95% CI: 8.13, 25.02 μg/L;P<0.001).A total of 117 participants were assessed for RBC folate, which also increased in the supplementation group; the aMD was 461 μg/L (95% CI: 387, 535 μg/L;P<0.001).Conclusions: Supplementation of FA leads to an increase of serum and RBC folate, but does not change plasma MMA concentration in individuals with serum vitamin B-12 between 150 and 280 ng/L.We cannot exclude effects inolder people or those with serum vitamin B-12 <150 ng/L.Previously reported associations may arise from effects of impaired vitamin B-12 status on folate metabolism.This trial was registered at www.isrctn.com as ISRCTN37558856.J Nutr2021;151:3738–3745.
Keywords: folic acid, vitamin B-12, methylmalonic acid, metabolism, public health Introduction The interaction between vitamin B-12 and folate has important public health implications. For example, folic acid (FA) supple- mentation corrects the anemia of vitamin B-12 deficiency but not vitamin B-12–related neurological changes ( 1).Permanent nerve damage might occur if vitamin B-12 deficiency remains untreated, although the evidence for such “masking” is scarce, even after folate fortification of food ( 2).The rationale for many countries to introduce such fortification was to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects ( 3), and this hasproved remarkably successful ( 4).However,the combination of mandatory fortification and self-supplementation has exposed a significant proportion of these populations to concentrations of FA above the upper intake level ( 5).
This has led to various concerns regarding the potential tox- icity of such exposure.These include possible associations with an increased incidence of colorectal and breast cancers,autism,and cognitive function ( 5), although significant controversy exists (6). For example, in areas with mandatory fortification, high serum folate combined with low serum vitamin B-12 C⃝The Author(s) 2021.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition.This is an Open Access article distributed u nder the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Manuscript received February 25, 2021.Initial review completed March 29, 2021.Revision accepted August 2, 2021.First published online September 11, 2021; doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxab280.
3738 is associated with cognitive impairment in the elderly ( 7– 10). However, no such association is observed in nonfortified countries ( 11,12).A cross-sectional study of >10,000 participants in the US NHANES observed a relation between serum folate and a metabolic marker of an enzymatic function of vitamin B- 12 (13).The vitamin B-12–dependent enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA.Plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentration increases with suboptimal serum vitamin B-12 and, in the absenceof renal impairment, is a useful functional marker of its status.However, in individuals with low serum vitamin B- 12 ( <148 pmol/L ∼200 ng/L) in the NHANES study, mean MMA concentration increased significantly with increasing serum folate ( P=0.008) (13).There is little prior evidence that FA affects MMA accumu- lation and biologically one might not expect any interaction between these 2 molecules.
However, several other cross-sectional reports have also suggested that this might occur in the context of high FA intake from mandatory fortification of foods plus high supplement usage ( 14).The question is relevant because it might provide evidence that high FA intake interferes with vitamin B-12 metabolism. One hypothetical explanation is an adverse oxidative effect of unmetabolized FA (UMFA) on vitamin B-12 homeostasis (13).Alternatively, people with existing low vitamin B-12 might fail to synthesize polyglutamated intracellular folate—an essential prerequisite for its cellular retention—hence accountingfortheobservedcross-sectionalassociationbetween MMA and serum folate ( 15).There is a high prevalence of metabolic vitamin B-12 defi- ciencyintheelderly( 16).Thisisassociatedwithlowercognitive function scores ( 17).If FA increases MMA concentration, this is vitally important for public health decisions concerning food fortification ( 6,18).
It is impossible to distinguish cause from effect in cross- sectional studies ( 19,20). We designed the FolATED (Folate Augmentation of Treatment—Evaluation for Depression) trial to investigate FA augmentation of antidepressive treatment byrandomly assigning patients to either 5 mg of FA or placebo daily (21).The objective of this substudy was to assess the effect of FA supplementation on MMA concentration in patients with low or marginal vitamin B-12 concentrations.Methods Patients FolATED was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted across 3 UK centers ( 22).Between July 2007 and November The FolATED (Folate Augmentation of Treatment—Evaluation for Depression) trial (21) was supported by UK National Institute of Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme project number 04/35/08 (to ITR).
The funder played no role in designing and implementing the trial or analyzing and interpreting data; the full trial was published in Health Technology Assessment 2014;18(48) ( 22).

Of the 475 patients randomized to daily placebo or5 mg FA daily for 12 wk, we included 440 in the FolATED analysisby treatment allocated. The substudy inclusion criteria were patientshaving low (150–219.9 ng/L) or marginal (220–280 ng/L) serumvitamin B-12 at recruitment.Blood samples were taken at baseline andat 12 wk.Settings Three centers throughout Wales were involved with recruitment: NorthEast Wales, North West Wales, and Swansea.Randomization The sequence was generated using a varying permuted block designstratified by site.Laboratory methods Serum and RBC folate and serum vitamin B-12 were analyzed at localNational Health Service laboratories on the day of collection.“Access”folate and vitamin B-12 chemiluminescence immunoassays (BeckmanCoulter)wereusedinNorthEastandNorthWestWales,whereas“Elec-sys” folate and vitamin B-12 electrochemiluminescence immunoassays(Roche) were used in Swansea.
We undertook biochemical analyses inthe Department of Medical Biochemistry at the University Hospital ofWales in Cardiff.The samples for homocysteine and MMA were storedfrozen at −70 ◦C until completion of the study. We measured plasma homocysteine using a commercially available assay for the AbbottDiagnostics ARCHITECT system, and plasma MMA using a GC-MSassay (23).To minimize interbatch variation, we assayed samples from the same participant in the same batch; the mean intrabatch CV was <3% for homocysteine and <8% for MMA.Power calculations Fedosov ( 24) suggested that patients with vitamin B-12 as high as 280 ng/L may be vitamin B-12 deficient.We assayed MMA in all (n=177)patientswithbaselinevitaminB-12between150and280ng/L andestimatedthiswouldyield80%powertodetectanincreaseof42%in mean MMA concentration after augmentation of FA,assuming therewas an effect, using a type 1 error at 0.05.
Ethics In2006,theMulticenterResearchEthicsCommittee(MREC)forWalesgave ethical approval for FolATED, and the Medicines and Healthcareproducts Regulatory Agency issued the Clinical Trial Authorization.In 2009 the MREC gave additional permission to investigate theinteraction between FA and MMA. Outcomes The primary outcome was MMA concentration at week 12.Thesecondary outcomes were serum folate,RBC folate,and serum vitaminB-12; and homocysteine collected at week 12.Outcome assessment timing and blinding status of participants Blood samples were drawn from the included participants to assess the biochemistry outcomes at baseline and week 12.The participants,and researchers taking the sample, were blinded to the allocation.Theanalystsundertakingtheinitialanalysiswerepseudo-blindedduringtheFolATED analysis ( 22).All researchers were unblinded at the timing of the analysis for this study.Statistics Data analysis.We followed the CONSORT reporting checklist for reporting a clinical trial.

To determine whether an effect was concentrated within a more inadequate vitamin B-12 status range, a subset analysis of the 81 participants with vitamin B-12 <220 ng/L was performedasasecondarysensitivityanalysis.Withinthesamplewitha“low”vitaminB-12baselinemeasurethebetween-groupMMA aMD was 0.01 (95% CI: −0.07, 0.09; P=0.75), i.e., comparing the supplemented group with the control group. Similar findings were reported for each of the biochemistrymeasures,thusalowvitaminB-12patientpopulationexhibited similar findings to those from a low or marginal population.Discussion The FolATED trial showed conclusively that FA does notpotentiate antidepressant medication ( 22).In this subgroup of depressed but otherwise healthy participants with baselineserum vitamin B-12 concentrations that were “low” (between 150 and 220 ng/L) or “marginal”(between 220 and 280 ng/L), 5 mg FA/d for 12 wk did not significantly change MMAconcentration.Our study has several strengths.

The fact that patients received FA alone in the FoLATED trial makes it unique; in most other trials investigating FA, participants are treated with a combination of FA plus vitaminB-12 in order to avoid alleged adverse effects from FA. It is also important to note that our study participants had an average age highly similar to that of the NHANESstudy (13).The concentrations of serum folate achieved in our study were at least as high as those seen in previous studies and homocysteine was lower after 12 wk in the groupreceiving FA therapy; daily supplementation with 5 mg FA is expected to reduce homocysteine blood concentration by approximately one-quarter, according to our study’s baselinevalues (i.e., from 14.6 μmol/L to 11 μmol/L) (25).Consistent with this,homocysteine concentrations fell from baseline in the FA-supplemented group to a mean of 11.2 μmol/L, although therewasnostatisticaldifferenceintheweek12between-group mean difference ( P=0.10).
Nevertheless, this fall, together with the very high serum folate and RBC folate concentrationsachieved, does mean that biologically relevant metabolites are alteredbyFAtreatment,makingthefactthatthereisabsolutely no change in MMA very interesting. However, there are several important weaknesses.First, we powered the FolATED trial to test whether FA potentiates antidepressant medication.
Because that limits power toinvestigate MMA in low serum vitamin B-12 we set the criterion for that at 220 ng/L rather than 200 ng/L ( 13); we also extended MMA assays to those with “marginal” vitamin B-12, because Fedosov ( 24) suggested they might also have TABLE 4 Missing observations for each outcome by randomized group1 Measure Placebo ( n=85) Folic acid ( n=92) At baseline Vitamin B-12 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Plasma MMA concentration 20 (23.5) 22 (23.9) Serum folate 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0)RBC folate 10 (11.8) 11 (12.0) Homocysteine 2 (2.35) 3 (3.26) At 12 wk Vitamin B-12 6 (7.06) 5 (5.44) Plasma MMA concentration 20 (23.5) 22 (23.9) Serum folate 6 (7.06) 5 (5.44)RBC folate 24 (28.2) 36 (39.1) Homocysteine 9 (10.6) 13 (14.1) 1Values are n(%). MMA, methylmalonic acid.a vitamin B-12 insufficiency.Secondly, the exclusion criteria for FolATED included a serum vitamin B-12 concentration <150 ng/L.Hence, we cannot exclude the possibility that FA increasesMMAat verylowserumvitaminB-12concentrations.
However,ethical constraints on administering FA to vitamin B- 12–deficientpatientswillpreventanysuchtrialbeingperformed (6,20). We also cannot completely exclude the possibility of a potential drug (antidepressant) and nutrient (FA) interaction, although this would seem unlikely.Finally, the FolATED trial population had a mean age of 46 y.Hence, we cannot excludethe possibility that FA increases MMA in older people.It is also possible that a longer exposure to FA might adversely influence MMA concentrations.Nevertheless, we found no evidence of an effect of high daily doses of FA over 3 months on MMA concentrations.Others have suggested that the association observed in cross-sectional studies might be due to a direct adverse effect of UMFA on vitamin B-12 metabolism ( 13).Unfortunately, we did not directly measure UMFA in our study.
Our findingsperhaps lend support to the alternative interpretation: that an elevated folate concentration is a consequence of pre- existing vitamin B-12 deficiency. This could arise either fromimpaired cellular uptake of folate or from its increased efflux in vitamin B-12 deficiency.There are no known mechanisms for the former.The latter suggestion relates to the “methyl-folatetrap”wherebyreducedconversionof5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5mTHF) to tetrahydrofolate, owing to reduced activity of the vitamin B-12–dependent enzyme methionine synthase, leads toegress of unconjugated 5mTHF into the circulation because 5mTHF is not a preferred substrate for folyl polyglutamate synthase ( 15,26).Although this might indeed explain the observed cross-sectional association between MMA and serum folate it is inconsistent with the increase in RBC folateseen in our FA-supplemented patients ( Tables 2,3)a n dw i t h the observation by Miller et al.

In 1 retrospective review the association between MMA and folate occurred only in participants >60 y old with “low to normal”serumvitaminB-12( 27).Noassociationwasapparent in a group of university students with low serum vitamin B- 12 (28).The mean age of our participants was 46 y, hence we cannot exclude the possibility that FA affects MMA in older populations.Perhaps the association becomes more apparent in the elderly, as age-related renal impairment slows MMAexcretion ( 29,30).These findings address an important public health issue ( 20) of the impact of FA augmentation.
FA increases RBC folateand serum folate,but supplementation does not change plasma MMA concentration in middle-aged individuals with serum vitaminB-12between150and280ng/L.Withtheseconstraints Folic acid supplementation and methylmalonic acid 3743 in mind,we suggest that FA does not affect biological pathways leading to adverse health effects, nor vitamin B-12’s function anditsroleinsustaininghealth( 6),atleastinyoungandmiddle- aged subjects. In conclusion, augmentation of FA did lead to a change in RBC folate and serum folate but did not lead to any change in MMA in patients with low or marginal serum vitamin B-12.Further interventions,with a greater sample size and longer duration of treatment, are ultimately required to determine whetheranybiologicalinteractionexistsbetweenFAintakeandserum MMA concentration.
