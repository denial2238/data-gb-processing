Myrrh protects against IL-13-induced epithelial barrier breakdown in HT-29/B6 cells Helena Hader1, Nina A.Hering2, Jörg-Dieter Schulzke1, Roland Bücker1*†and Rita Rosenthal1† 1Department of Gastroenterology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Clinical Physiology/Nutritional Medicine, Charité —Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany,2Department of General and Visceral Surgery, Charité —Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany The oleoresin myrrh has been used for centuries as an anti-in ﬂammatory remedy for a variety of diseases and is said to have a protective effect on the intestinalepithelium.An intact epithelial barrier function is the prerequisite for a healthy gut.Inﬂammatory and infectious diseases of the intestine, in particular, lead to barrier impairment resulting in leak- ﬂux diarrhea and mucosal immune responses.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effectof myrrh in an experimental in ﬂammatory situation, namely, under the in ﬂuence of IL-13, one of the key cytokines in ulcerative colitis. We used human intestinalepithelial HT-29/B6 cell monolayers for functional and molecular assessment ofthe epithelial barrier under IL-13 and myrrh treatment.IL-13 induced a loss inbarrier function that was fully restored with myrrh treatment, as shown by transepithelial electrical resistance measurements.The molecular correlate of the IL-13-mediated barrier dysfunction could be assigned to an upregulation ofthe channel-forming tight junction (TJ) protein claudin-2 and to a subcellularredistribution of the TJ protein tricellulin, loosening the sealing of tricellular TJs.Moreover, IL-13 exposure leads to an increase in the number of apoptotic cells,contributing to the leak pathway of barrier dysfunction.
Myrrh protected againstchanges in TJ deregulation and decreased the elevated apoptotic ratio under IL-13. The protective effects are mediated through the inhibition of the STAT3 and STAT6 pathway.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that myrrh exhibits antagonizing effects against IL-13-induced barrier impairment in a humanintestinal cell model.These data suggest the use of myrrh as a promisingoption in the treatment of in ﬂammatory bowel disease.KEYWORDS Myrrh, tight junction, barrier function, claudin, tricellulin, apoptosis, STAT pathway, inﬂammatory bowel disease Introduction An impaired intestinal barrier function is a key mechanism in in ﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD), a term that comprises Crohn ’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).Currently, IBD patients are commonly treated with immunosuppressive medication, causingnumerous side effects ( Kucharzik et al., 2019 ).
For this reason and as the incidence of IBDs is globally increasing ( Arms-Williams et al., 2022 ), it is crucial to examine other target substances of herbal origin, such as myrrh, as potential treatment options. While the exact etiology of CD and UC remains unresolved, it was shown that the increased expression of the proin ﬂammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF α)OPEN ACCESS EDITED BY Massimo Lucarini, Council for Agricultural Research andEconomics, Italy REVIEWED BY David R.Brown,University of Minnesota Twin Cities,United States Miguel Angel Plaza, University of Zaragoza, Spain *CORRESPONDENCE Roland Bücker, roland-felix.buecker@charite.de †These authors share last authorship RECEIVED 25 September 2023 ACCEPTED 03 November 2023 PUBLISHED 17 November 2023 CITATION Hader H, Hering NA, Schulzke J-D,Bücker R and Rosenthal R (2023), Myrrhprotects against IL-13-induced epithelialbarrier breakdown in HT-29/B6 cells.Front.Pharmacol.14:1301800.

Especially IL-13 has been identi ﬁed as an important effector cytokine in UC (Heller et al., 2005 ). Predominantly known for the effect of IL-13 in immune-mediated processes and allergic in ﬂammation, it has been shown that patients with IBD express higher amounts of IL-13 intheir lamina propria cells than found in the gut of healthyindividuals ( Fuss et al., 2004 ).Via the receptors IL-13R α1 and IL-4R α, IL-13 impairs epithelial barrier function by affecting epithelial apoptosis, tight junctions (TJs), and restitution velocityin UC ( Heller et al., 2005 ).The TJ connects intestinal epithelial cells at their most apical point of the lateral membrane, forming a single continuous layer ofenterocytes ( Chiba et al., 2008 ).TJs ensure barrier integrity, control paracellular transport processes and determine the polarization ofthe cell ( Zihni et al., 2016 ).
TJs are composed of transmembrane proteins belonging to different families: claudins, tight junction-associated MARVEL proteins (TAMPs) and junctional adhesionmolecules (JAMs). Especially claudins and TAMPs play an integral role for barrier function and encompass both sealing and selective channel-forming properties ( Günzel and Fromm, 2012 ).In addition, intracellular scaffold proteins, namely, ZO-1 and ZO-2 (Zonulaoccludens proteins-1 and -2) link the transmembrane TJ proteins toother TJ-associated proteins and to the intracellular actincytoskeleton ( Chiba et al., 2008 ).By regulating the expression and localization of TJ proteins, certain phytochemicals, such as berberine ( Amasheh et al., 2010 ), quercetin ( Amasheh et al., 2008 ), shogaol ( Luettig et al., 2016 ), or punicalagin metabolites ( Hering et al., 2021 ) are already known to exert barrier-stabilizing effects.
For instance, berberine protectsagainst TNF α-mediated barrier impairment and TJ dysregulation (Amasheh et al., 2010 ;Luettig et al., 2016 ). Quercetin enhances barrier function via upregulation of ZO-1 and -2, claudin-1 and -4(Amasheh et al., 2008 ;Suzuki and Hara, 2009 ).Moreover, in vivo as well as in vitro experiments have shown that curcumin and resveratrol have barrier-protective properties during a Campylobacter jejuni infection ( Lobo de Sá et al., 2019 ;Lobo de Sá et al., 2021 ).A further ethnopharmaceutical is myrrh, a term referring to the dried oleo-gum resin obtained from the bark of Commiphora myrrha , a tree native to North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.The compound consists of 30% –60% water-soluble gums, 25% –40% alcohol-soluble resin and 3% –8% essential oils ( Kuck, 2021 ).It has been used for religious, cosmetic and medical purposes since antiquity ( Shen et al., 2012 ).
First remedies containing myrrh were described by Dioskurides in his Materia medica (Dioskurides, 2005 ). The medicinal herb was used for chronic cough, abdominal pain and diarrhea.In modern times, myrrh ismainly used in mouthwash solutions and for the treatment of smallskin lesions ( Shen et al., 2012 ).Currently, there are two preparations for the treatment of other diseases available on the global market:Mirazid, an antischistosomal medication that has been introduced in 2001 to the Egyptian market ( ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015 ), and Myrrhinil Intest, a combined preparation of myrrh, chamomileand coffee charcoal, which has been found to be non-inferioragainst mesalazin, the current gold standard remissionmaintenance medication in UC ( Langhorst et al., 2013 ).The Myrrhinil Intest drug was effective in the treatment of acutediarrhea caused by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inmaintenance of remission in UC.
In experiments conductedin vitro , myrrh exhibits barrier-stabilizing and spasmolytic effects in intestinal cells ( Weber et al., 2020 ). The anti-in ﬂammatory effect of myrrh was shown for various pro-in ﬂammatory cytokines, chemokines and prostaglandins in intestinal and immune cells(Manjula et al., 2006 ).Myrrh exerts barrier-stabilizing and -protective effects against TNF αin HT-29/B6 and Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells ( Rosenthal et al., 2017 ).Myrrh extract was able to reduce the production of CXCL13, IL-6, IL-8, PGE2,MCP-1, IL-10 and TNF αin macrophages ( Vissiennon et al., 2017 ).Furthermore, previous studies showed the protective effect of myrrh in murine models of DSS-, TNBS- and oxazolone-induced colitis (Cheon et al., 2006 ;Mencarelli et al., 2009 ).Therefore, the aim of this study was to decipher the molecular mechanisms and the involvedsignaling pathways of myrrh ’s protective effect on epithelial barrier function and against the proin ﬂammatory cytokine IL-13.
Methods Cell culture and experimental setup HT-29/B6 cells, a subclone of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 ( Kreusel et al., 1991 ), were cultured in 25 cm2culture ﬂasks in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA, United States) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum(Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA, United States) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidi ﬁed atmosphere (95% air, 5% CO 2)a t3 7°C. The cells were seeded on 3.0 μmﬁlters (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, United States) and up to four ﬁlters were placed into one culture dish.Seven to eight days afterseeding, the cell monolayers reached con ﬂuence (600 –800Ωcm 2 transepithelial electrical resistance) and were used for experiments.The ethanolic extract of the herbal compound myrrh was providedby Prof.
Jörg Heilmann, (Institut für Pharmazie, Lehrstuhl für Pharmazeutische Biologie, Universität Regensburg, Germany) and prepared as stock solutions of 500 mg/mL in 100% ethanol or200 mg/mL in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). To mitigate thecytotoxic effects of ethanol and DMSO, the ﬁnal utilized concentration of the solvents was below 0.1%.Prior tostimulation with IL-13, the cells underwent 2 h of preincubationwith myrrh.200 μg/mL myrrh was added to cell medium and dissolved in a soni ﬁcation bath before application on the apical and basolateral side of the ﬁlter.Subsequently 10 ng/mL IL-13 (Peprotech, Hamburg, Germany) was added basolaterally.Likewise, the histone acetylation inhibitor SAHA exhibitingSTAT3 and STAT6 inhibition was applied 2 h before IL-13exposure (10 μM SAHA, Cat.149647-78-9, Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany, Axon Medchem, Groningen, Netherlands;10 µM SAHA is effective in blocking STAT6; Rosenthal et al., 2017 ).
In experiments aiming at the signaling pathways cell monolayers were serum starved for 4 h, followed by a two-hour incubation period with myrrh. After incubation with IL-13 for 1 h, the cells werescraped and lysed for Western blot experiments.To detect apoptoticcells, levels of caspase-3/-7 activity were determined using the Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 02Hader et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1301800 SensoLyte Homogeneous AFC Caspase-3/7 Assay kit according to manufacturer ’s instructions (Biotrend Chemikalien GmbH, Cologne, Germany).Electrophysiological and ﬂux measurements The transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of the monolayer was assessed under sterile conditions at 37°C.The measurements were mechanically standardized using a pair of chopstick electrodes(STX2, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, United States)with constant immersion depth.
One electrode was placed on eachside of the ﬁlter while in the culture dish and the electrical resistance was obtained using a volt-ohm meter (constructed in the Clinical Physiology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin) referred to an empty ﬁlter and the cell medium as blank. Data is presented in percentage of the initial resistance before treatment with therespective substances.Unidirectional ﬂux measurements were performed in Ussing chambers under short-circuit conditions asdescribed before ( Günzel et al., 2009 ).Following equilibration, the paracellular ﬂux marker ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran 4 kDa (FD4, TdB Consultancy, Uppsala, Sweden) was added apically (ﬁnal concentration 200 μM).Samples were taken from the basolateral side every 20 min and analyzed by spectrophotometry(Tecan GmbH, Männedorf, Switzerland).FD4 permeability ispresented as the quotient of ﬂux and concentration difference.
Western blotting For protein expression analysis via Western blot the cells were rinsed two times with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS, ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA, United States) and homogenized with whole cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100%and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), one tablet Complete ProteaseInhibitor Cocktail/10 mL lysis buffer (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)). Forphosphoblots, buffer solution c ontaining 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM Na 4P2O7,1m MN a 3VO 4,1m M PMSF, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/mL leupeptin and protease inhibitors was used.Subsequently, the cells were carefullyscraped from the ﬁlter.The lysate was incubated on ice for up to 60 min, followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 x g and 4 °C.The supernatant was transferred into fresh vials.
To determine the proteincontent the Pierce BCA kit was used according to manufacturer ’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA, United States). Proteins were resolved in polyac rylamide gels ranging from 8.5% – 12.5% at 100 V and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Perkin Elmer, Rodgau, Germany) after electrophoresis.Overnight, themembranes were incubated at 4 °C with primary antibodies against TJ proteins, signaling pathway proteins as well as their phosphorylatedforms (1:1,000, claudin-1 (Cat.519000), claudin-2 (Cat.325600),claudin-3 (Cat.341700), claudin- 4 (Cat.329400), claudin-5 (Cat.352500), claudin-7 (Cat.349100), claudin-8 (Cat.400700Z),tricellulin (Cat.700191), occludin (Cat.711500), Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) or β-actin (1:10,000, Cat.AM4302, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States).
After rinsing with tris-buffered saline-Tween solution (TB ST), incubation with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse in TBST with 1%milk powder) for 1 h followed (1:10,000 (Cat. 111-036-003 and Cat.115-036-003), Jackson Immuno Research, Cambridge House, United Kingdom).Signal detectio n was conducted after incubation for 5 min in SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Stable Peroxide Solution(Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA, United States), using Fusion FX7 imaging system.Image Studio Lite (version 5.2, 2015, LI-COR Biosciences Inc., Lincoln, NE, United States) was used for densitometric quanti ﬁcation.The TJ protein or phospho protein expression levels were normalized to β-actin or unphosphorylated form as loading control.Immuno ﬂuorescence staining For immuno ﬂuorescence stainings, cells were washed with PBS and ﬁxed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA, United States).
After 3 washing steps with PBS, permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min andincubation for 1 h in blocking solution (containing 5% goat serum,0.05% Triton X-100, and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) followed. Primary antibodies against TJ proteins (claudin-2 (Cat.325600, 1:100),tricellulin (Cat.700191, 1:200), occludin (Cat.711500, 1:100) and ZO-1(Cat.MA3-39100-A647, 1:100), Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) were added for incubation overnight.After rinsing with blocking solution, the cells were incubated with anti-mouse oranti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 488 or594 for 1 h (1:200) at 37 °C (Cat.A11034 and Cat.A11032, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States).Nuclei were counterstainedwith 4 ′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:1000, Cat.10 236 276 001, Roche AG, Mannheim, Germany) for 10 min.
Stainingsusing the TUNEL kit according to manufacturer ’s instructions ( In situCell Death Detection Kit, Roche AG, Mannheim, Germany) were used for apoptosis quanti ﬁcation. Cells were embedded in ProTaqs MountFluor (Biocyc, Luckenwald e, Germany) and visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss 780, Zeiss, Jena, Germany).Statistics Data are shown as arithmetic mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).One-way-ANOVA and Bonferroni-Holm correction formultiple comparisons were used to perform statistical analysis.Analyses were carried out with GraphPad PRISM (version 9.0,2020, GraphPad Software, Inc.San Diego, CA, United States).Ap-value smaller than 0.05 was considered signi ﬁcant.p< 0.05 depicted as *, p<0.01 as ** and p<0.001 as ***.Results Myrrh restores barrier function after IL-13- induced impairment How the cytokine IL-13 causes int estinal barrier disruption via various mechanisms has previously been described ( Heller et al., 2005 ).
In order to investigate a potential protective effect of myrrh on IL-13- induced epithelial barrier dysfuncti on, the TER of HT-29/B6 monolayers was measured. Previous experiments have used a concentration of200μg/mL myrrh to in ﬂu e n c eT E R ,w i t h o u tc y t o t o x i cs i d ee f f e c t s Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 03Hader et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1301800 (Rosenthal et al., 2017 ).Measurements were performed over an incubation period of 24 h.Incubation with 200 μg/mL myrrh alone did not change the TER value signi ﬁcantly, although a slight increase of 5% could be observed compared to con trols (myrrh: 101% ± 2%, control: 96% ± 2%, n = 15 –18).Treatment with the proin ﬂammatory cytokine IL-13 (10 ng/mL) caused a drop in TER of 30% after 24 h (70% ± 2%, n =18,p<0.001).Cells exposed to IL-13, but pre-incubated for 2 h with 200μg/mL myrrh did show an attenuated decrease (88% ± 2%, n = 15, p<0.001, Figure 1A ).
Considering the TER as a measure for the tightness of an epithelial layer, my rrh exhibits potential protective properties. Paracellular permeability under IL-13 and myrrh exposure While the TER is a marker for the ion permeability of the epithelial barrier, we determined in the following step whethermyrrh has protective properties concerning the paracellular permeability of larger molecules.In Ussing chambers, ﬂux measurements of the paracellular marker FITC-dextran with amolecular mass of 4 kDa (FD4) were performed for calculationof the FD4 permeability.Compared to controls, IL-13 caused anincrease in paracellular permeability for FD4 (0.66 ± 0.10 ·10 −6cm/s, n=8 , p= 0.027, Figure 1B ).The preincubation with myrrh reduced the effect of IL-13 on the permeability increase but failed to reachstatistical signi ﬁcance (0.45 ± 0.06 ·10 −6cm/s, n = 8, p= 0.168, Figure 1B ).
Effect of myrrh on IL-13-mediated changes in tight junction protein expression and localization Myrrh inhibits claudin-2 upregulation induced by IL-13 To investigate whether myrrh pr otects the epithelial barrier by in ﬂuencing the composition of T J proteins, Western blot analyses were performed ( Figure 2 ). The expression of the claudins-1 to −8 as well as of tricellulin and occludin was quanti ﬁed by densitometry.All cla udins except the channel- forming claudin-2 remained unchanged after treatment withIL-13 or myrrh ( Figure 2 ).Densitometric analysis showed a three-fold increase in claudin-2 expression in cells in cubated with IL-13 (compared to controls, n = 12, p<0.0001).Myrrh alone does not induce a signi ﬁcant change in claudin-2 levels compared to controls (compared to controls, n = 12, p= 0.9792).
The incubation with myrrh before challenge with IL-13 counter-regulates the IL-13 effect, leading to a strong d ecrease in claudin-2 expression compared to IL-13-treated cells (compared to controls, n = 12,p= 0.0006). Furthermore, a decrease in tricellulin expression was observed in cells treated with IL-13 ( Figure 2 ).IL-13 reduced the expression of tricellulin to 75% ± 4% compared to controls (n = 10, p= 0.0034).This decrease in expression was not attenuated by myrrh (74% ± 10%, n = 10, p= 0.5079).Subcellular tight junction protein localization In addition to the changes in TJ protein expression, seen in Western blots, an altered protein localization may also contribute tobarrier defects.While Western blots are a quantitative measurementfor protein expression, immuno ﬂuorescence staining provides information on protein localization and thus on TJ architecture.Thus, confocal laser-scanning microscopy was used to investigate TJ protein localization in presence of myrrh and IL-13.
The TJ proteins claudin-1 to −8 were counterstained with ZO-1, tricellulin was stained together with occludin. There were no alterations foundfor claudin-1 and for claudin-3 to −8 (data not shown).Controls and cells treated only with myrrh did not show a visible amount ofclaudin-2 in their membranes as shown in Figures 3A, B .Corresponding to the Western blot results, cells incubated withIL-13 did show a higher incorporation of claudin-2 into the plasma membrane of the epithelial cells ( Figure 3C ).In cells preincubated with myrrh before undergoing treatment with IL-13, the claudin-2 FIGURE 1 Effect of myrrh on the epithelial barrier defect caused by IL-13.HT-29/B6 cell monolayers were incubated for 2 h with 200 μg/mL myrrh, following basolateral incubation with 10 ng/mL IL-13.(A)Effect on transepithelial electrical resistance (TER).TER was measured24 h after treatment.Control was set to 100%.Myrrh had an inhibitoryeffect against the IL-13-induced decrease in TER.

Transepithelial ﬂux was measured in Ussing chambers using the paracellular marker FD4.IL-13 caused an increase in permeability to FD4, which myrrh reduced, but this did not reach statistical signi ﬁcance.N = 8, ns = not signi ﬁcant, *p<0.05, *** p<0.001, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 04Hader et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1301800 FIGURE 2 Effect of IL-13 or myrrh and the combination of both on tight junction protein expression in HT-29/B6 cells.(A)Representative Western blots of epithelial TJ proteins after myrrh and IL-13 incubation.Proteins were isolated following 24 h of treatment and quanti ﬁed using densitometric analysis, normalized to β-actin (B).Expression of TJ proteins was altered as a result of IL-13 and myrrh treatment.IL-13 caused an increase in claudin-2 that was inhibited by myrrh.
A decrease in tricellulin under IL-13 treatment was observed, which did not change by myrrh preincubation. Other TJ proteins were not affected by myrrh or IL-13.N = 6 –12, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.Comparisons were made between IL-13-treated cells and untreated controls.Comparisons were also made between the group of IL-13 plus myrrh treatment versus the cells treated withIL-13 alone.FIGURE 3Claudin-2 distribution in HT-29/B6 cells after incubation with IL-13 and myrrh.Representative immuno ﬂuorescence stainings of claudin-2 (green) and Zonula occludens protein-1 (ZO-1, red), obtained in Z-stacks using confocal laser-scanning microscopy.(A)Control (B)myrrh (C)IL-13 (D)myrrh + IL-13.In control monolayers and myrrh-treated cells, claudin-2 was not detectable.IL-13 induced an upregulation and incorporation of claudin-2 i nto the membrane.Under treatment with myrrh, claudin-2 could not be detected.
Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 05Hader et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1301800 signal was reduced and was comparable to the (non-visible) control level ( Figure 3D ).Additionally, an altered distribu tion of tricellulin was observed.In controls and cells treated with myrrh, t ricellulin appeared well-localizedin the tricellular junction ( Figures 4A, B ).Under challenge with IL-13, tricellulin was found to be redistrib uted from tricellular TJ domain into the bicellular TJ domain, as seen in Figure 4C .Remarkably, the treatment with myrrh reversed this redi stribution of tricellulin ( Figure 4D ).FIGURE 4 Tricellulin distribution after incubation with IL-13 and myrrh in HT-29/B6 cell monolayers.Representative immuno ﬂuorescence stainings of tricellulin (green) and occludin (red), obtained in Z-stacks using confocal laser-scanning microscopy.(A)Control, (B)myrrh, (C)IL-13 and (D)myrrh + IL- 13.
In controls and cells incubated with myrrh, tricellulin appears exclusively in the tricellular TJ and does not show any redistribution.

10.3389/fphar.2023.1301800 Protective effect of myrrh on epithelial apoptosis caused by IL-13 A relevant mechanism for a decrease in TER can be a higher apoptotic rate ( Heller et al., 2008 ). In order to examine whether myrrh takes effect on the epithelial barrier by changing the apoptoticrate of HT-29/B6-monolayers, we performed TUNEL stainings forcell death counting.After 24 h of treatment, cells were stained withDAPI to detect cell nuclei and TUNEL reagent for cell death detection.The cell monolayers were visualized with confocallaser-scanning microscopy ( Figure 5A ).The apoptotic rate was determined by dividing the TUNEL-positive cells by total cellcount.In IL-13-challenged monolayers, the apoptotic rateincreased ( Figure 5B ).The apoptotic effect of IL-13 was inhibited by myrrh preincubation ( Figure 5B ).These observations were con ﬁrmed by measuring caspase-3 and -7 activity for FIGURE 6 Effect of myrrh on IL-13-induced signaling pathways.Analysis of signaling pathways.

Densitometric intensity of (A)p-STAT3, (B)p-STAT6 and (C)p- Akt Ser473 is increased in cells treated with IL-13.Myrrh attenuates this increase.n=8–12, * p<0.05, * p<0.001, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 07Hader et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1301800 apoptosis detection.Cells incubated with myrrh alone did not show a signi ﬁcantly lower or higher apoptotic rate compared to controls (Figure 5C ,n=9 –12,p= 0.991).However, exposure to IL-13 induces a two-fold increase in apoptotic rate ( Figure 5C , n = 12, p<0.001).This higher apoptotic rate was decreased by preincubation withmyrrh and restored the ratio to control levels ( Figure 5C , n = 12, p< 0.001).Therefore, the barrier-protecting effect of myrrh is partly due to the prevention of apoptotic leaks induced by IL-13.
Involved signaling pathways To uncover the underlying signaling pathways involved in the barrier-stabilizing effect of myrrh, we analyzed the phosphorylation of signaling proteins by Western blots. Following incubation with myrrh for 2 h, HT-29/B6 cells were exposed to IL-13 for 1 h and lysedafterwards.Western blots for detection of the phosphorylation ofJAK/STAT, STAT3, STAT6, Akt Ser473, Akt Thr308, p-38 and p-42/44 were carried out.Densitometric analysis was performed and thephosphorylated proteins were normalized to their unphosphorylatedcounterparts.The densitometric intensity of p-38, p-42/44 andp-Thr308 did not signi ﬁcantly change under treatment with myrrh or IL-13 (data now shown).As shown in Figures 6A, B , IL-13 induced the STAT3 and STAT6 signaling of the pathway Janus kinase/signaltransducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT).
Compared tocontrols, the densitometric intensity of phosphorylated STAT3 in IL-13-treated cells increased (compared to control monolayers, n = 8 –12, p= 0.0006). This increase was attenuated by preincubation with myrrh (compared to IL-13 exposure, n = 9 –12,p= 0.0006) (Figure 6A ).Secondly, an increased phosphorylation of STAT6 under IL-13 was observed (compared to controls, n = 8, p<0.001).Treatment with myrrh could reduce also this increase although to a lesser extent (compared to IL-13 exposure, n = 8, p= 0.037) ( Figure 6B ).Furthermore, an activation of the PI3K/Akt-pathway via phosphorylation of Ser473 was observed.IL-13-treated cells showedan increased signal for phosphorylated Ser473 (compared to controls,n=1 2 , p<0.001), while preincubation with myrrh attenuated this increase (compared to IL-13 exposure, n = 12, p<0.001) ( Figure 6C ).
Myrrh attenuates IL-13-induced STAT phosphorylation and inhibits the IL-13-mediated claudin-2 upregulation Previous studies showed that the claudin-2 upregulation under inﬂammatory conditions is mediated by STAT signaling ( Rosenthal et al., 2017 ;Krug et al., 2018 ). To further determine whether myrrh exerts its barrier protective effects by inhibiting the JAK/STAT-pathway, we inhibited STAT3 and STAT6 phosphorylation usingthe inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, Vorinostat).Following the previously described protocol, HT-29/B6 cells werepreincubated with SAHA or myrrh for 2 h and then challenged with10 ng/mL IL-13.Subsequently, cells were lysed and Western blots of claudin-2 were performed.Myrrh preincubation reduced the claudin-2 expression compared to cells treated with IL-13 alone.However, cells incubated with SAHA and IL-13 did show a muchstronger decrease in claudin-2 expression compared to cells treated with myrrh and IL-13, as shown in Figure 7 .
Therefore, together with the data from Figure 6 , it can be hypothesized that myrrh attenuates the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT6 and consecutivelyreduces the IL-13-mediated claudin-2 upregulation. Discussion Herbal compound myrrh Resinous extracts of herbal origin are an essential component in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and Unani, the Perso-Arabic medicine ( Batiha et al., 2023 ).The oleo-gum resin myrrh, known for its anti-in ﬂammatory effects, has been used for treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms in traditional and modern medicine(al-Harbi et al., 1997 ).Previous literature indicates the ef ﬁcacy of myrrh against diarrhea in IBD, which requires further in-d epth research to investigate the molecular processes behind the effects ( Langhorst et al., 2013 ).In particular, the intestinal epithe lial barrier and its involvement in inﬂammatory processes leading to leak- ﬂux diarrhea are of interest.
Recently, barrier-stabilizing effe cts of myrrh were demonstrated for intestinal epithelial cell monola yers (HT-29/B6, HT29-MTX-E12 and Caco-2 cell lines) ( Rosenthal et al., 2017 ;Weber et al., 2020 ). To further elucidate a potenti al protection of myrrh against cytokines present in UC, especially IL-13, our research aimed atd i a r r h e a lm e c h a n i s m si nd i s e a s e ss u c ha sU C .W ec o u l ddemonstrate for the ﬁrst time that myrrh mitigates IL-13-induced barrier defects by protecting epith elial barrier function.This could be ascribed to two major effects: the reduction of epithelial apoptosis and the downregulation of the channel-forming TJ protein claudin-2.A higher apoptotic rate, seen in cell monolayers incubated with IL- 13, causes apoptotic leaks in the inte stinal epithelial layer and thus may promote the in ﬂux of noxious agents such as toxins and antigens.
In turn, this antigen in ﬂu xl e a d st oe v e nh i g h e ri n ﬂammatory levels in the gut mucosa and can contribute to leak- ﬂux diarrhea and the leaky gut phenomenon, which describes the vicious circle of in ﬂammation- induced barrier dysfunction and the enhanced antigen in ﬂux through the weakened epithelial barrier ( Bücker et al., 2014 ;Bücker et al., 2018 ). Thus, an anti-apoptotic effect of myrrh is of high importance for patients with active IBDs.Our experiments haveshown a strong increase in apopto tic rate in IL-13-incubated cells compared to controls, an effect t hat was completely reversed by preincubation with myrrh.As second main ﬁnding, the paracellular permeability for FD4 tends to be reduced presumably by the concomitant redistribution of tricellulin.Immuno ﬂuorescence stainings did show a shift of tricellulin from the tricellula r TJ into the bicellular TJ under treatment with IL-13, while no signi ﬁcant change in expression levels was observed.
These ﬁndings correspond to our and other experiments regarding the paracellular ﬂux of the marker FD4 through the tricellular TJ ( Awad et al., 2023 ). Tricellulin tightens the tricellular TJ against the in ﬂux of macromolecules and is regulated via the IL-13a2 receptor ( Krug et al., 2018 ).As the redistribution of tricellulin is m itigated by myrrh, the protection against such macromolecule in ﬂux is ensured.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 08Hader et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1301800 Besides tricellulin, the TJ protein claudin-2 is affected by IL-13.Claudin-2 forms a paracellular channel for small cations as well asfor water, the upregulation of which causes barrier impairment inthe colon by affecting the pore pathway ( Amasheh et al., 2002 ; Rosenthal et al., 2010 ).
It was shown that proin ﬂammatory cytokines in IBD, such as TNF α, induce an increase of claudin-2 expression, promoting the leaky gut and the leak- ﬂux type of diarrhea ( Heller et al., 2005 ;Zeissig et al., 2007 ). In our HT-29/B6 cell monolayers, IL-13 induced a three-fold increase in claudin-2 expression.Thisincrease was attenuated by myrrh preincubation to control levels.These results on IL-13-induced claudin-2-upregulation withsubsequent increased barrier permeability here in our presentstudy are paralleled by similar ﬁndings in an earlier study ( Heller et al., 2005 ).However, as major ﬁnding of our present study, myrrh mitigates this upregulation and exerts a barrier-protective effect.Furthermore, we investigated possible TJ-associated signaling pathways to determine how myrrh in ﬂuences the alterations seen in TJ protein expression.IL-13 interferes with the STAT pathway,mainly induces phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT6.
Treatmentwith myrrh is effective in blocking STAT-phosphorylation underchallenge with IL-13. Moreover, the SAHA-mediated STAT- inhibition prevents the upregulation of claudin-2 caused by IL-13 as well.Thus, it is suggestive that myrrh exerts its protective effectsagainst IL-13 and its observed TJ expression alterations by inhibitingSTAT phosphorylation.STAT3 is phosphorylated by members of the IL-6 family and is mainly known for the promotion of immunosuppression and itseffect in colorectal cancer progression following constitutiveactivation ( Zou et al., 2020 ).Especially relevant in carcinogenesis and chemoresistance, in both CD and UC patients the activation of STAT3 leads to prolonged survival of pathogenic T cells ( Atreya et al., 2000 ;Musso et al., 2005 ).Furthermore, in asthma and allergic inﬂammation, a higher STAT3 activation in Th2 cells was induced under treatment with IL-13 ( León and Ballesteros-Tato, 2021 ).
Our study showed the STAT3 activation in intestinal epithelial cells,caused by IL-13 and inhibition by myrrh.The phosphorylation and activation of STAT6 is mainly induced by IL-13 and IL-4 ( Karpathiou et al., 2021 ). A murine model of UC showed the STAT6-dependent induction ofclaudin-2 expression ( Rosen et al., 2013 ).Additionally, in UC, IL-13 and TNF αexpress synergistic effects on activation of STAT6, causing altered TJ protein expression, especially of claudin-2 ( Domazetovic et al., 2020 ) .W h i l ep r o t e c t i v ea n d barrier-stabilizing effects of myrrh against the cytokine TNF α have previously been shown ( Rosenthal et al., 2017 ), our present study extends these ﬁndings to IL-13, a main mediator in UC.As TNFαis correspondingly increased in patients with IBDs, the importance of myrrh as a potential additional treatment optionin IBD is highlighted with the present ﬁndings.
Other plant-derived remedies with an effect on STAT6 Myrrh is only one of several compounds currently being investigated for their effects on the epithelial barrier function andstructure in different phases of IBD. Herbal remedies are of particular interest in IBD research, mainly because they impose fewer side effects.Curcumin, an herbal compound obtained from turmeric, was shown to in ﬂuence epithelial barrier and TJ proteins.Against TNF α and C.jejuni , curcumin had a barrier-stabilizing effect via up- regulating TJ proteins claudin-4 and -8 as well as occludin andZO-1 through NF- κB signaling ( Lobo de Sá et al., 2019 ;Iglesias et al., 2022 ).Furthermore, it was observed to restore immunologic balance in experimental colitis by modulating JAK/STAT/SOCS signaling (Zhao et al., 2016 ).With a similar mechanism of action to myrrh, Vitamin D (1,25(OH) 2D3) can modulate claudin expression in patients with UC ( Stio et al., 2016 ).
Vitamin D effects the STAT6 and Smad7 pathways ( Domazetovic et al., 2020 ). Especially the vitamin D-induced inhibition of STAT6 was linked to the FIGURE 7 Inhibitory effect of STAT inhibition on claudin-2 expression (A)Representative Western blots of claudin-2 in HT-29/B6 cells after incubation with myrrh, IL-13 and SAHA.(B)Proteins were isolated and quanti ﬁed using densitometric intensity analysis, normalized to β-actin.The IL-13-induced increase in claudin-2 expression is attenuated under treatment with myrrh and the STAT inhibitor SAHA.n=1 2 ,* * p<0.01, **** p<0.001 one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09Hader et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1301800 claudin-2 downregulation ( Domazetovic et al., 2020 ).This reiterates the potential of STAT6 inhibition as a target structure in IBDtreatment.
Conclusion In conclusion, we showed the barrier-protective effects of myrrh against the cytokine IL-13, a major effector cytokine in UC, whichcauses claudin-2 upregulation and apoptosis induction. Incubationwith myrrh results in a downregulation of claudin-2 and a reducedapoptotic rate, regulated via the STAT3/STAT6 pathways.With itslimited side effects compared to immunosuppressive medication,the herbal compound could be a valuable addition to the treatment of IBD patients and diarrhea.Data availability statement The raw data supporting the conclusion of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics statement Ethical approval was not required for the studies on humans in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirementsbecause only commercially available established cell lines were used.Author contributions HH: Data curation, Formal Analysis, Investigation, Writing –original draft.
