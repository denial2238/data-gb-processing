ORIGINAL ARTICLE Acetyl L-carnitine protects adipose-derived stem cells against serum-starvation: regulation on the networkcomposed of reactive oxygen species, autophagy, apoptosis and senescence Tianyun Pan .Yao Qian .Tian Li .Zikai Zhang .Yucang He .Jingping Wang .Liqun Li .Yun Hu .Ming Lin Received: 28 April 2021 / Accepted: 5 December 2021 / Published online: 16 January 2022 /C211The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.2021 Abstract Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) play an important role in cell therapy and regenerative medicine.However, local nutritional deﬁciency oftenlimits therapeutical effect of the transplanted cells.Acetyl L-carnitine (ALC) is a common energy metabolism regulator and free radical scavenger.Thisstudy investigated the effect of ALC on ADSCs exposed to severe serum-deprivation and explored the relative machanisms.
Treating with 1 mM ALCimproved proliferation and alleviated senescence of starved cells, accompanied with reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased protein expres-sion of SOD1 and catalase. In addition, ALC inhibited apoptosis but increased starvation-induced autophagy, which might be related to the regulation of phases ofdissociation of Bcl-2-Beclin1 and Bcl-2-Bax com- plexes.Evidence obtained by replacing ALC withN-acetylcysteine (N-AC) suggested that ROS might be the central inducer of autophagy, apoptosis and senescence.There was a difference between ALC andN-AC in the protection mechanism, that was, com- pared with N-AC, ALC maintained autophagy well at the same time as anti-oxidation.Inhibition of autop-hagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) partially offset the protective effect of ALC.
However, despite low-level ROS and enhanced autophagy, ALC with high con-centration (10 mM) markedly aggravated cell apop- tosis and senescence, thus losing cytoprotection and even causing damage.

L-carnitine (LC) and its derivant acetyl L-carnitine (ALC) have been widely applied in the ﬁelds of weightloss and ﬁtness because of their roles in the process of fatty acid metabolism and energy generation (Re- bouche, 2004 ). In recent years, it was demonstrated that ALC preserved the structure and function of mitochondria and accelerated the removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Villa et al.1988 ; Palermo et al.2010 ; Musicco et al.2011 ; Bodaghi-Namileh et al.2018 ).In addition, LC can delay the aging process of ADSCs (Mobarak et al.2017 ) and reduce the senes- cence-associated secretion of adipose tissue by inhibiting the JNK/p53 signaling pathway (Yang et al.2019 ).Similarly, it was discovered that ALC enhanced the expression of survival-associated pro- teins (such as Bcl-2 and Ki-67) and weakened that of death-related proteins (such as caspase-3 and Bax) tohelp cells defend against a variety of stresses (Bak et al.2016 ; Keshavarz-Bahaghighat et al.
2018 ; Abdolmaleki et al. 2020 ).Based on these researchs above, we thought that ALC might maintain the viability and survival of serum-starved ADSCs.An appropriate level of autophagy may contribute to the survival of cells under stresses.The increased autophagy can block apoptosis signaling and reduce cell death rate (Kang et al.2011 ; Li et al.2015 ), and Beclin1-associated autophagy can defer the aging of stem cells by relieving the accumulation of intracel- lular ROS (Hou et al.2013 ; Chen et al.2016 ).LC and ALC appear to modulate intracellular autophagy under certain conditions.It was demonstrated that feeding individual with LC promoted autophagy andreversed mitochondrial damage caused by chronic stresses, such as obesity and smoking (Chan et al.2017 ; Choi et al.2018 ).Qiao et al.( 2021 ) and Jamali- Raeufy et al.( 2021 ) discoverd that ALC improved the level of autophagy and helped cells recover from oxidative stress.
The results of our previous study showed that treating ADSCs with ALC protected cells from H 2O2-induced damage by increasing AMBRA1- related autophagy and decreasing ROS production (Qian et al. 2021a ).In the present study, we investi- gated the effects of ALC on the viability, proliferationand senescence of ADSCs cultured in serum-freemedium, and explored the roles of apoptosis, autop- hagy and ROS generation in the process.Materials and methods Acquisition of adipose tissue The fat tissues were obtained from 5 randomly selected healthy adult patients who underwent lipo- suction of the thighs or abdomen at the First Afﬁliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (Wehnzhou,China) from May 14th to July 12th, 2020 (1 male and 4 female patients between the ages of 26 and 38 years; the mean age was 33 years).All patients did not haveserious infectious and metabolic diseases, and they signed the informed consent for scientiﬁc research and publication.
The experiments performed in the presentstudy followed the Helsinki Declaration and the guidelines of the Research Ethics Committee of Wenzhou Medical University (Wenzhou, China). Isolation of ADSCs Brieﬂy, the fat granules were digested with 0.1% collagenase I (C0130, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 37 /C176C for 45 min, and ﬁltered with a 100 and a 200 meshstrainers sequentially.Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged at 250 g at room temperature for 5 min and resuspended in complete culture medium(HUXMD-90011, Cyagen Biosciences, USA) supple- mented with 10% FBS, 1% glutamine and 1% penicillin–streptomycin at 37 /C176C with 5% CO 2.The culture medium was replaced every 2–3 days, and cells at passage 5 were used in the subsequent experiments.Characterization of ADSCs The multi-directional differentiation capacity of ADSCs was demonstrated by differentiating cells into adipogenesis, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis.
Brieﬂy, cells reaching 60% conﬂuence were cultured in Human Mesenchymal Stem Adipogenic Differen-tiation Medium (HUXMD-90031, Cyagen Bio- sciences, based on insulin, dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and rosiglitazone) orOsteogenic Differentiation Medium (HUXMD- 90021, Cyagen Biosciences, based on dexamethasone, 123106 Cytotechnology (2022) 74:105–121 b-glycerophosphate and L-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate) for 2 weeks according to the manufacturers’ instruc- tion. For the chondrogenesis assay, cells were cen-trifuged at 250 g for 4 min and the formed pellet was cultured in Human Mesenchymal Stem Chondrogenic Differentiation Medium (HUXMD-90041, CyagenBiosciences, based on dexamethasone, ascorbate, insulin-transferrin-selenium supplement, sodium pyruvate, proline, TGF- b3) for 3 weeks.
After ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde (P1110, Solarbio Science, CHN), the samples were respectively stained with Oil Red O, Alizarin Red or Alcian Blue, and imaged usingan inverted microscope (CKX41, Olympus Corpora- tion, JPN). Experimental protocol and treatment This study was mainly composed of two parts of experiments.In Part I, serum-starved cells were treated with gradient concentrations of ALC (A6706, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to determine the drug concen-tration with maximum safety and protection.The effect of ALC addition at this concentration (1 mM) on cell activity was dynamically monitored, and theoptimal starvation time (8 h) was selected.After- wards, cell proliferation, senescence, oxidation level, apoptosis and autophagy were detected under theabove test condition.In Part II of this study, 5 mM N- AC (HY-B0215, MedChemExpress, USA) was used to replace ALC and determine the effects of intracel-lular ROS on cell activity, senescence, autophagy and apoptosis.
In addition, in order to reveal details in the effects of autophagy and ALC concentration on theabove biological processes, cells were pretreated with or without 5 mM autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (HY- 19312, MedChemExpress, USA) 2 h prior to serum-starvation and addition of different concentrations of ALC (1 or 10 mM). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay In order to determine the appropriate ALC working concentration and serum-starvation time, ADSCs at passage 5 were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of5910 3cells/well.After cultured in complete med- ium for 24 h, cells were divided into three groups for different experimental purposes.Cells of Group 1were cultured for 8 h in complete medium containing different concentrations of ALC (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and100 mM).Cells treated with no ALC served as control group.Cells of Group 2 were starved for 8 h with ALC in a narrower concentration range (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5,10 mM).Cells without starvation were set as control group.
Cells of Group 3 were cultured in serum-free medium for different time (0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h),with or without ALC (1 mM) treatment. Then CCK-8 assay was conducted.Brieﬂy, cells in each well were washed with PBS twice to removeresidual serum, and incubated in 100 lL complete medium containing 10% CCK-8 reagent (CK04, Dojindo Molecular Technologies, JPN).After 1 h,the optical density values were calculated using a microplate reader (SpectraMax Plus384, Molecular Devices Corporation, USA).The CCK-8 assay wasrepeated to detect the effect of ALC (1 or 10 mM) and N-AC on cell activity of starved ADSCs.Trypan blue staining After serum-starved for 8 h with or without ALC treatment (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 mM), cells were collected and resuspended in the recycled serum-free medium with a concentration of 1 910 6cells/ml.
Subse- quently, cells were incubated with 0.04% Trypan Blue (C0040, Solarbio Science) for 3 min and immediately counted using a Countess II Automated Cell Counter(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, USA). The result was presented as the percentage of dead cells stained with Trypan Blue.EdU (5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine) staining ADSCs were seeded at 5 910 5cells/well in a 12-well plate and cultured in serum-free medium for 8 h with or without ALC (1 mM) treatment simultaneously.Cells cultured in complete medium were set as control group.Then the cells were washed with PBS twice and incubated in complete medium containing 50 lM EdU (C10310, Ribobio, CHN) for 2 h at 37 /C176C, followed by ordinal staining using Apollo567 and Heochest according to the manufacturer’s instruction.The samples were observed under an ECLIPSE TI ﬂuorescence inverted microscope (Nikon Corperation,JPN).A total of at least 800 cells for each group were counted, and the percentage of EdU-positive cells was calculated.
123Cytotechnology (2022) 74:105–121 107 Senescence-associated b-galactosidase staining The level of intracellular b-galactosidase was detected in both parts of this study to reveal the degree of cell senescence. ADSCs were seeded at 5 9105cells/well in a 12-well plate, treated as described in the experimental protocol, and then re-fed in complete medium for 48 h prior to the detection.According tothe manufacturer’s instruction, the cells were ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then stained using a Senescence-Associated b-galactosidase Stain- ing Kit (C0602, Beyotime, CHN) in a carbon dioxide- free incubator at 37 /C176C for 12 h.The samples were washed twice in PBS for 5 min and sealed using acoverslip.For each sample, ﬁve random ﬁelds were selected and a total of at least 200 cells per ﬁeld were counted microscopically.The percentage of b-galac- tosidase positive cells was calculated.
Intracellular ROS detectionIntracellular ROS levels were detected using 2,7- Dichlorodi -hydroﬂuorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA,CA1410, Solarbio Science) in both parts of the study. Brieﬂy, ADSCs were seeded and treated as described above, and then incubated with 10 lM DCFH-DA for 20 min at 37 /C176C according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Subsequently, cells were washed twice with PBS and observed under a ﬂuorescence invertedmicroscope at an excitation wavelength of 484 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm.The ratio of mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) of ROS to that ofDAPI was calculated for analysis.Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and Annexin V/Propidium Iodide (AV/PI) assay Cell apoptosis was determined using TUNEL assay in Part I and AV/PI assay in Part II, respectively.
For TUNEL assay, cells treated as described in ‘‘EdUstaining’’ section were collected and incubated in 50 lL One Step TUNEL Apoptosis Assay Kit reagent (C1089, Beyotime, CHN) in the dark at 37 /C176C for 1 h. Then the cells were washed in PBS twice and analyzed using a FACSVerse ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences).The forward scatter area signal was used for cellcounting.At least 5 910 5cells delivering a valid FL2-A signal ( [1.659105) were counted, and themean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) was calculated using FlowJo 7.6 software (BD Biosciences).For AV/PI assay, cells were treated with N-AC, ALC or 3-MA as described in experimental protocol, and collected and washed in pre-cooling PBS (4 /C176C).Then cells were resuspended in 300 lL Binding Buffer containing 5 lL Annexin V-FITC (401,006, BestBio, CHN) and incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature, followed by staining with 10 lL PI (Cat.No.ditto) dye for 10 min.
Finally, at least 5 9105 cells form each sample were analyzed using ﬂow cytometry and the apoptosis rates were calculated. Acridine orange (AO) staining Cells were treated as described in Part II of the protocol.Brieﬂy, the original medium was discarded.After washed once with AO Stain Buffer, cells werestained with 5% AO Stain (DA0037, Leagene, CHN) for 15 min and with Heochest for 10 min in the dark at room temperature.Finally, the samples were washedin the basic medium and observed under a ﬂuores- cence microscope.For each group, a total of at least 400 cells were counted, and the ratio of acidicvesicular organelles (AVO) to cell number was calculated.Western blotting ADSCs were seeded at 1 910 6cells/well in a 6-well plate, treated as described in the ‘‘protocol’’ section, and then lysed with RIPA buffer (R0010, Solarbio Science) on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 22,000 gat 4/C176C for 11 min.
The supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (P0012, Beyotime, CHN). After-wards, SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting was performed according to a previous study (Bak et al.2016 ).The rabbit anti-human primary antibodies (Full details are given in Table 1) against NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, LC3B II/I, Beclin1, p62, SOD1, catalase, p16, Ki-67, GAPDH, and the goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conju- gated to horseradish peroxidase (SE134, SolarbioScience, CHN) were used in this experiment.The bands were visualized using ECL detection reagent (PE0010, Solarbio, CHN) in a ChemiDoc MP ImagingSystem (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.), and their 123108 Cytotechnology (2022) 74:105–121 densities were normalized by GAPDH and presented as fold change relative to the control group.
Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) For the co-IP assay, cells were serum-starved for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h, with or without 1 mM ALC treatment. Brieﬂy, after the removal of nonspeciﬁc adsorption by using A/G agarose beads (36403ES03,Yeasen Biotechnology, CHN) in advance, new beads and antibodies against Beclin1 or Bax were succes- sively added to the protein samples, followed byincubation at 4 /C176C overnight.Then the beads were boiled in 2X Laemmli loading buffer for 10 min, and the puriﬁed protein sample and anti-Bcl-2 primaryantibody were used in Western Blotting analysis.Protein samples screened by co-IP using IgG rather than the speciﬁc antibodies were set as negativecontrol, and those without co-IP served as positive groups (Input groups).Statistical analysis All experiments were performed at least three times.Results are presented as the mean ±SD.Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVAfollowed by Tukey’s test using SPSS 20.0 software (IBM Corp., USA).
p \0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically signiﬁcant difference. Results The isolated ADSCs possessed pluripotency Cells at passage 5 formed spindle shapes since the ﬁrst day after inoculation and arranged in swirls 3 days later (Fig.1a).The formation of lipid droplets, calci- ﬁed nodules and acid mucopolysaccharides in the differentiation experiment demonstrated the multi- directional differentiation potential of the isolatedcells (Fig.1b).In addition, in our previous study, the phenotypic characteristics of homologous ADSCs were examined using ﬂow cytometry.It was revealedthat antibodies against human cluster of differentiationTable 1 Primary antibody information Name Dilution ratio Company Cat.

ALC improved viability, proliferation and delayed senescence of serum-starved ADSCs The result of CCK-8 assay showed that ALC at concentrations below 1 mM did not damage ADSCs while that at 10 and 100 mM inhibited cell viabilityobviously. There was an opposite relation between the results of CCK-8 assay and Trypan Blue staining when cells were treated with ALC at the concentrationsranging from 0.1 to 10 mM.ALC at 1 mM maximized OD value at 450 nm and minimized the percentage of Trypan Blue-stained cells, suggesting the best thera-peutic effect.In addition, the viability of ADSCs gradually decreased with the increase in time of serum starvation, and reached a plateau since 8 h poststarvation.ALC (1 mM) increased cell activity ateach time point, and this effect became more obvious in the cells starved for longer than 8 h (Fig.2a).As shown in Fig.
2b, cells with active proliferation incorporated more EdU into replicating DNA mole- cules and emitted stronger red-ﬂuorescence afterstained with Apollo567. Serum-starvation decreased the percentage of EdU-positive cells (from 38.4±1.20% to 9.8 ±0.51%), which was reversed by 1 mM ALC treatment (rose to 15.5 ±0.82%) (Fig.2b).In addition, the results of Western blotting analysis showed that the expression of stem cell marker proteins (OCT4, NANOG, SOX2) decreased in serum-starved cells but maintained in the presence of1 mM ALC (Fig.2c).As a common indicator of senescence, intracellular b-galactosidase was detected and the trend reﬂected in results was the oppo-site of those in stemness proteins expression.The percentage of b-galactosidase-positive cells was sig- niﬁcantly increased from 9.12 ±0.19% to 26.93 ±1.67% by 8-h starvation, but it was reduced Fig.1 Morphology and multi-directional differentiation of ADSCs.
aMorphology of the 5th passage ADSCs in a culture ﬂask on day 1, 2 and 3 post inoculation. bAfter stained with Oil Red O, Alizarin Red and Alcian Blue, lipid droplets, bonematrix and endogenous acid mucopolysaccharides were observed microscopically (black arrows).Scale bars = 100 lm.ADSCs adipose-derived stem cells 123110 Cytotechnology (2022) 74:105–121 again to 15.41 ±0.76% when with 1 mM ALC treatment (Fig.2d).ALC regulated the level of ROS and protein expression of two antioxidant enzymes DCFH-DA was easily loaded into cells and oxidized by intracellular ROS.This made cells emit green ﬂuorescence proportionate to the level of ROS.Wefound that serum-starvation increased ROS production while 1 mM ALC signiﬁcantly relieved it (Fig.3a).In addition, treating cells with 1 mM ALC inhibitedstarvation-induced decrease in the expression of SOD1 and catalase (Fig.3b), which might be related to the down-regulation of ROS by ALC.
ALC modiﬁed apoptosis, promoted autophagy, and regulated the dissociation of Bcl-2-Baxand Bcl-2-Beclin1 complexes ALC (1 mM) inhibited starvation-induced apoptosis and promoted autophagy level. The result of TUNEL assay showed that serum-starvation signiﬁcantly increased the MFI of FL2-A from(2.30 ±0.06) 910 5to (3.48 ±0.10) 9105while 1 mM ALC decreased this value to (2.35 ±0.07) 9105(Fig.4a).Protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 and the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 were up-regulated by starvation but reduced to lower levels in the presence of ALC (1 mM) (Fig.4b).Apart from that, the transformation from LC3B I to LC3B II and the expression of Beclin1 were enhanced by serum-starvation, whereas the expression of p62, akey autophagy substrate, was decreased.It was unexpected that these changes were further augmented by 1 mM ALC, suggesting that an increased level ofautophagy had been established (Fig.4c).
The results of co-IP followed by Western blotting showed that cells of the input groups normallyexpressed Bcl-2 during starvation, and the bond between Bax or Beclin1 and Bcl-2 gradually weak- ened as the starvation time increased. Following ALC (1 mM) treatment, the time point at which the Bcl-2- Bax complex completely dissociated was postponedfrom 16 to 24 h, while that of the Bcl-2-Beclin1 complex was advanced from 4 to 2 h (Fig.4d).Effects of N-AC and ALC on cell morphology and activity Morphological observation showed that compared to starvation group, the cells treated with N-AC (5 mM)or ALC (5 mM) got better adhesion and had contours with higher plumpness.In contrast, there was shrink- age and detachment of cells treated with high ALCconcentration (10 mM) or 3-MA, causing lower cell density and more suspended dead cells and debris (Fig.5a).CCK-8 assay conﬁrmed the phenomenon observed under light microscope.
Both N-AC and ALC (1 mM) signiﬁcantly increased the activity of starved ADSCs,while autophagy speciﬁc inhibitor 3-MA (5 mM) reduced the protective effect of ALC. Surprisingly, compared to the low concentration, ALC at theconcentration of 10 mM resulted in low cell activity, at which time the addition of 3-MA did not signif- icantly change the OD value (Fig.5b).Effects of N-AC and ALC on intracellular ROS generation Both ALC with concentrations of 1 mM and 10 mM signiﬁcantly alleviated ROS level in serum-starvedADSCs, but there is no signiﬁcant difference in antioxidant effect between these two concentrations.N-AC (5 mM) treatment further reduced the contentof ROS compared with ALC groups (1 or 10 mM).However, ROS level in both ALC treatment groups abnormally increased when with the addition of 3-MAin advance (Fig.6).
Effects of N-AC and different concentrations of ALC on apoptosis, autophagy and senescence in serum-starved ADSCs The results of Western blotting showed that N-AC treatment reduced the expression of cleaved caspase- 3, Beclin1 and the ratio of LC3BI I to LC3B I in thestarved cells, suggesting the consistent decrease in apoptosis and autophagy. ALC (1 mM) not only inhibited cleaved caspase-3 expression but maintainedthe protein levels of the autophagic markers.Both N-AC and 1 mM ALC decreased the expression of senescence biomarker p16 and increased that ofproliferation-related marker Ki-67.In addition, both the addition of ALC with high concentration and the 123Cytotechnology (2022) 74:105–121 111 pretreatment of 3-MA enhanced cleaved caspase-3 expression and accelerated senescence phenotype.There is no signiﬁcant effect of adding 3-MA before 10 mM ALC on the protein expression of cleavedcaspase-3, p16 and Ki-67, except for the inhibited autophagy level (Fig.7a).As shown in Fig.
7b, ﬂow cytometry suggested that N-AC and ALC reduced cell apoptosis rate, while 3-MA pretreatment or high ALC concentration 123112 Cytotechnology (2022) 74:105–121 (10 mM) increased it in varying degrees. This trend was strongly consistent with the change of expression of cleaved caspase-3.Staining with acridine orange (AO) usually pro- duces weak and uniform green ﬂuorescence in normal cells, but dense and bright yellow-green ﬂuorescencein apoptotic cells.Intracellular acidic vesicular organelles (AVO), positively correlated with autop- hagy, are often stained as red particles.In this study,both N-AC and ALC (1 mM) reduced the aggregation of green ﬂuorescence in the nucleus or cytoplasm, suggesting the inhibited apoptosis.The intensity ofgreen ﬂuorescence was not measured due to inade- quate accuracy.ALC (1 and 10 mM) up-regulated the ratio of the number of intracellular AVO to cellnumber, while 3-MA pretreatment down-regulated it, and enhanced green ﬂuorescence (Fig.7c).
These results conﬁrmed the effects of ALC and 3-MA on theexpression of apoptosis or autophagy-related proteins as described above. The detection of senescence-associated b-galac- tosidase was illustrated in Fig.7d.Compared with other groups, the generation of intracellular b-galactosidase in N-AC or ALC (1 mM) treatment group was signiﬁcantly inhibited, which was sup- ported by the changes in protein expression of p16 andKi-67.Discussion As described above, many researches have demon- strated the modulating effects of ALC on cell activity, ROS generation, apoptosis and autophagy in cells under various stresses.However, there is still a lack ofsystematic research on the details of interrelation of these processes, and the relative mechanisms remains unclear.
In this study, deprivation of fetal bovineserum (FBS) was used as starvation condition, and modulations of the aforementioned biological pro- cesses by ALC in serum-starved ADSCs were inves-tigated to provide evidence for possible clinical application of ALC on autogenous fat transplantation. It was reported in the previous studies that serum deprivation decreased the level of cellular DNA/ mRNA biosynthesis (Hultga ˚rdh-Nilsson et al.1993 ; Miller and Johnson, 1996 ) and aggravated mitochon- drial dysfunction (Bialik et al.1999 ; Zhu et al.2006 ), which were both related to ROS generation.Yang et al.found that ALC prevented DNA methylation andincreased gene expression of antioxidant enzymes by protecting Nrf2 from proteolysis (Yang et al.2015 ).ALC treatment are also proved to improve the activityof antioxidase system and reduced ROS production in the cells under a variety of stresses (Nagesh et al.2011 ; Yang et al.2015 ; Keshavarz-Bahaghighat et al.2018 ).
The present study demonstrated that ALC (1 mM) treatment signiﬁcantly decreased ROS pro- duction, and increased the expression levels of twoimportant antioxidant enzymes, SOD1 and catalase, (Fig. 3), which were consistent with the above-men- tioned studies.Moreover, Robinson et al.( 2019 ) and Gu et al.( 2020 ) found that ALC accelerated the generation of endogenous ROS in zebraﬁsh under physiological conditions, despite of the improved mitochondrial function.However, in the present study, this weak effect might be masked by excellentantioxidant activity of ALC and became invisible.It was demonstrated in our previous study that serum deﬁciency to a certain level (2% FBS) pre-vented adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs, resulting in the maintainance of stemness (Qian et al.2021b ).bFig.2 Effects of ALC on cell viability and senescence of serum-starved ADSCs.aCells treated with different ALC concentrations and starvation time were used for CCK-8 assay and Trypan Blue staining.

Intracellular ROS at a low level maintained the quiescent state of cancer-initiating cells (CIC) and increased chemoresistance, while high-level ROSreduced properties of CIC and enhanced cell differ- entiation and radiosensitivity (Chang et al. 2014 ).However, completely suppressed ROS production bysilencing COX-2 with shRNA made cancer cells lose stemness and malignancy (Giannoni et al.2011 ).Based on these ﬁndings, we speculated that what led tothe increase in stem cell markers might be the appropriate level of ROS regulated by ALC ratherthan the direct drug effect.In addition, it was demonstrated that starvation-induced autophagy mediated the maintenance of quiescence (An et al.2014 ; Li et al.2019 ).ALC (1 mM) might inhibit cell senescence by enhancing this effect apart from the suppressed ROS level, which was further veriﬁed bythe fact that 3-MA pretreatment prior to ALC accel- erated senescence (Fig.7ad).
There is often an opposition between the changes of autophagy and apoptosis under stresses (Kang et al. 2011 ; Li et al.2015 ).It was interesting that ALC (1 mM) inhibited apoptosis and further promotedautophagy in the serum-starved ADSCs (Fig.4).Wei et al.demonstrated that nutrient deprivation progres- sively activated JNK1-mediated phosphorylation of Fig.3 ALC alleviated the starvation-stimulated redox status of ADSCs.aROS level was determined by using DCFH-DA, and MFI of intracellular DCF was calculated.Scale bars = 100 lm.**p\0.01.N = 3.bWestern blotting was performed to detect protein levels of two antioxidant enzymes (catalase and SOD1).Equal loading of proteins was conﬁrmed using GAPDH.**p\0.01.N = 3.ROS reactive oxygen species, DCFH-DA 2,7-dichlorodi-hydroﬂuorescein diacetate, DCF 2’,7’-dichlo- roﬂuorescein, MFI mean ﬂuorescence intensity 123114 Cytotechnology (2022) 74:105–121 Bcl-2, which induced sequential separation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 and Bax (Wei et al.2008 ).
In the present study, we found that 1 mM ALC signiﬁcantly differ- entially regulated the dissociation of Bcl-2-Beclin1 complex at 2 h and that of Bcl-2-Bax complex at 8 h,respectively, suggesting that ALC up-regulated Beclin1-mediated autophagy at early stage andinhibited Bax-related apoptosis at late stage (Fig. 4d).In addition, this result might explain the phenomenonobserved in CCK-8 assay that the protective effect of ALC on cell viability appeared at 2 h and was maximized since 8 h post starvation (Fig.2a).N-AC (5 mM) was used to replace ALC for repeating partial experiments to study the role of Fig.4 Treatment with 1 mM ALC differentially regulated autophagy and apoptosis levels.aDetection of apoptosis by ﬂow cytometry using TUNEL staining.Cells with Cy3-dUTP- labeled DNA were counted, and the MFI of Cy3 probe was quantiﬁed on FL2-A channel.**p \0.01.N = 3.

Accompanied with intracellular ROS eliminated by N-AC, cell activity was improved,and autophagy, apoptosis and senescence were inhib- ited to varying degrees, indicating that ROS level might be the central component of this regulatorynetwork (Fig. 8).It was demonstrated that sustained low-level ROS was disadvantageous for maintaining the induction of autophagy (Li et al.2013 ), suggesting the protective effect of N-AC in this study might be independent of autophagy.Different from N-AC, ALC (1 mM) rescued cell viability in more ways than one,as it not only attenuated ROS generation but also maintained autophagy in starved cells.Moreover, we noticed that different concentrations of ALC led to distinct fates of starved cells.There wasa broad range of working concentrations of ALC used in the previous studies (Bak et al.2016 ; Keshavarz- Bahaghighat et al.2018 ; Abdolmaleki et al.2020 ).As shown in Fig.2a, the optimal concentration of ALC in this study was 1 mM.
The addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-MA weakened the protective effects of1 mM ALC, inducing the decreased cell viability and the increased ROS level, apoptosis and senescence (Figs. 5,6and7).These results comﬁrmed the partial dependence of ALC (1 mM) action on autophagy.However, ALC with high concentrations (more than or equal to 10 mM) had nagative effects on ADSCs evenwhen cells treated with no starvation (Fig.2a).Treating starved cells with 10 mM ALC still increased autophagy but not cell viability, indicating the loss ofprotective effect of autophagy induced by ALC of this Fig.5 N-AC and ALC improved morphology and activity of serum-starved ADSCs.aConﬂuence of starved ADSCs increased with 5 mM N-AC or 1 mM ALC treatment.Either or both 10 mM ALC and 3-MA reduced cell density andadhesion, causing more ﬂoating dead cells and debris.Scale bars = 50 lm.bThe effects of N-AC (5 mM), ALC (1 or 10 mM) and 3-MA (5 mM) on cell activity were determined by CCK-8 method.**p \0.01.
N = 4 123116 Cytotechnology (2022) 74:105–121 concentration. In addition, it was demonstrated that excessive or sustained autophagy, was no longer aradical scavenger and cell defender, but led to apoptosis, senescence or even autophagic cell death (Kang and Avery, 2008 ; Bernard et al.2020 ; Shi et al.2012 ).In this study, cell activity was not signiﬁcantly improved when with 3-MA pretreatment prior to 10 mM ALC, implying the harmful effects producedby ALC with high concentration (10 mM) were probably mainly due to the aggravated apoptosis rather than autophagic cell death.The molecu-lar mechanism underlying this phenomenon remained unclear.There are some limitations in this study.Firstly, although cells stained with Annexin V/PI and TUNELfor ﬂow cytometry showed different reductions of apoptosis rate when with 1 mM ALC treatment, the general trend of protective effect of ALC on serum-starved cells was consistent.
Quantitative detection of more apoptotic proteins may provide further valida- tion. Secondly, the present study demonstrated thatROS levels in the groups with 3-MA pretreatment raised again, indicating the ALC-induced autophagy in turn would inhibit ROS generation.However,whether this effect overlaps with the direct antioxidant capacity of ALC needs to be clariﬁed in further Fig.6 Effects of N-AC and ALC on ROS generation.aThe microscopic vision ﬁelds with similar cell densities were positioned by DAPI, and used for measuring the ﬂuorescenceintensity of intracellular green DCF.Scale bars = 20 lm.bALC in both concentrations of 1 and 10 mM reduced intracellular ROS, just not as much as N-AC did.Pretreatment with 3-MA signiﬁcantly reduced inhibitory effect of ALC onROS level.**p \0.01.N = 3 123Cytotechnology (2022) 74:105–121 117 studies.
Thirdly, because this was an in vitro study in which the concentrations of ALC used were relatively high and the observation time was short, animalexperiments would be expected to be carried out to further evaluate the efﬁcacy and safety of ALC. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the protective effect of 1 mM ALC on serum-starved ADSCs notonly relied on the alleviation of ROS level but also on the modulation of autophagy and apoptosis.The latter might be partly related with the alteration of dissoci-ation of Bcl-2-Beclin1 and Bcl-2-Bax complexes.However, treatment with high concentration of ALC (10 mM) would be counterproductive due to theintensiﬁed apoptosis (Fig.8).Fig.7 Roles of N-AC and ALC in the modulation of autophagy, apoptosis and senescence in starved cells.aAfter treated with 5 mM N-AC, 1 mM ALC or 10 mM ALC, cellswere used to detect the expression of LC3B, Beclin1, cleavedcaspase-3, p16 and Ki-67 proteins.*p \0.05, **p \0.01.N=3 .
