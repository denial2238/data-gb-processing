Tel:+201026269962; E-mail: olanafea@zu.edu.eg or olaenafea@gmail.com Abstract We designed this work to examine the curative role of l-carnitine (LCAR) in a rat model of cisplatin (CDDP)-induced kidney injury.We induced kidney injury in rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg of CDDP.Fifteen days post injection, rats were orally supplemented with 354 mg/kg of LCAR for another 15 days.Kidney tissues were subjected to histo-biochemical analysis along with mRNA gene expression quantification for cytoskeleton proteins encoding genes(vimentin, nestin, and connexin 43) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.LCAR reversed CDDP-induced renal structural and functional impairments.
LCAR significantly declined serum urea and creatinine concentrations, restored oxidant/antioxidant balance, reversed inflammation, and antagonized caspase 3-mediatedapoptotic cell death in renal tissues. Moreover, LCAR effectively down-regulated cytoskeleton proteins mRNA levels, reflecting amelioration of CDDP-provoked podocyte injury.We concluded that LCAR has a favorable therapeutic utility against CDDP-induced kidney injury.Key words: cisplatin, gap junction proteins, intermediate filaments, l-carnitine, podocyte Introduction Cisplatin,cis-diamminedichloridoplatinumII(CDDP)isaneffec- tive antineoplastic agent.Currently, the World Health Organiza- tionlistedCDDPasoneoftheessentialmedicines.CDDPisoneof themostcommonlyutilizedchemotherapeuticagentsforhema-tologic and solid tumor cancers [ 1,2].CDDP exerts its cytotoxic effectthroughcrosslinkingpurinebaseswithintheDNAstrands; causing DNA damage in malignant cells, blocking cell divisionwith resultant apoptotic cell death [ 3].
In this way, other non- targeted organ toxicities can develop. Renal dysfunction is oneof the most encountered complications of CDDP that limits its clinical applications [ 4–6].Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most serious and frequently reported side effect of CDDP.Approximately 20–30% of CDDP- received patients developed AKI [ 7,8].The nephrotoxicity of CDDP is cumulative and dose related.Patients who develop AKIaremorelikelytode velopchronickidne yinjuryandanincreased risk of mortality [ 4,9].Several postulated mechanisms of CDDP-induced kidney injury include mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, oxida- tive stress, and inflammatory response [ 9–12].52 Toxicology Research , 2021, Vol.10, No.1 Carnitine is an essential dietary nutrient that has a wide range of biological functions.Carnitine exists in two forms (d-carnitine and l-carnitine).l-carnitine (LCAR) is the biologically active form, while d-carnitine is toxic.
LCAR has an imperative role in energy metabolism because it acts as a carrier for acti-vated long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochon- drial matrix, where they are broken down via β-oxidation [ 13]. LCAR is synthesized in the human body from l-lysine and l-methionine amino acids, mainly in the kidney and the liver as well as it can be obtained exogenously from dietary sources [ 14].In1986,TheFoodandDrugAdministrationapprovedLCARas an orphan drug for primary LCAR-deficiency treatment.More- over, the drug can be exploited in conditions associated with secondary LCAR deficiency, e.g.renal disorders [ 15].Intermediate filaments (IFs) are one of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton proteins that are involved in the cell mechanical properties.IFs are characterized by distinctive extensibility and striking resilience that allow them to support cells againstexterior and interior forces [ 16,17].Currently, IFs are involved in many vital biological pathways [ 18].
Vimentin (Vim) is the most abundant and the studied type III IFs protein [ 19].Nestin (Nes) is another IFs principally expressed inneuralstemcells.Nesisexpressedtransientlyintheglomeru- lar podocytes and is imperative for the maintenance of thepodocyte foot process [ 20]. Gap junction proteins (connexins/Cxs) are key players in the cellularconnection,also they are critical in numerous vital mod-ulatory processes in the kidney, e.g.the renin-angiotensin sys-tem, tubule-glomerular feedback, and salt and water retention [21,22].Connexin 43 (Cx43) is found in the renal tubules and vasculatures.Furthermore, Cx43 is mostly found in glomerularpodocytes [ 23].The underpinning molecular mechanisms of the ‘sick’ podocyte have attracted escalating interest, which is pivotal inkeeping the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier.
The podocyte has a distinctive cytoskeleton that is dynamically controlled by constant alterations in contractility and motility.The discontinuity of integrity of the cytoskeleton proteins may cause podocytopathy with the subsequent decline in kidney function [ 24,25]. WehypothesizedthatLCARwouldreverseCDDP-inducedkid- ney injury.Accordingly, we conducted this study to examine the curative role of LCAR supplementation in a rat model of CDDP- induced kidney injury as well as the underlying mechanisms,focusing on the cytoskeleton proteins encoding genes: Vim,Nes, and Cx43.Materials and Methods Materials We purchased CDDP (Cisplatin®a vial contains 1 mg/ml of CDDP, Mylan institutional LLC, Rockford, IL, USA), LCAR (aliquid-formulation of 300 mg/ml,MEPACO-MEDIFOOD Company, Sharkia, Egypt).
Animals Thestudyincluded40adultmalealbinoratsweighing280–300g, which were obtained from the Breeding Unit of the EgyptianOrganization for Biological Products and Vaccines, VACSERA, Cairo,Egypt.The animals were housed in plastic cages with 12-h light and dark cycles, and allowed free access to food and water.For acclimation purposes, the rats were handled manually for 1 Figure 1 : Study design. week before the experiment to allow biological stabilization.All animals received humane care in compliance with the AnimalCare Guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and the DepartmentofAnatomy,BenhaFacultyofMedicineapprovedthe design of the experiment.Experimental design.We randomly assigned animals into four groups of 10 rats each: control, LCAR, CDDP, and (CDDP +LCAR) groups ( Fig.1).Group I (normal control): Received saline (1 ml daily), intraperitoneal injection (ip).
Group II (LCAR): Supplemented with LCAR in a dose of 354 mg/kg body weight, orally, once daily for 15 successive days. Group III (CDDP): Treated with CDDP in a single dose of 5m g / k g ,i p .Group IV (CDDP +LCAR): Treated with CDDP in a single dose of 5 mg/kg body weight, ip; then 15 days later, these rats were supplemented with LCAR in a dose of 354 mg/kg body weight,orally, once daily for another 15 successive days.Previous animal studies indicated that a single intraperi- toneal injection of 5 mg/kg CDDP can induce acute kidney failure [ 26–28].Clinical benefits were reported following daily oral administration of LCAR (4–6 g) in cancer patients, in terms of safety, effectiveness and alleviation of chemotherapy-related complications[ 29–31].TheselecteddoseofLCAR(354mg/kg/day) is parallel to the human dosing regimen of 4 g/day based on body surface area conversion [animal dose (mg/kg) =human equivalent dose (mg/kg) ×6.2], supposing that an adult person weighs 70 kg [ 32,33].
At the end of the treatment protocol, rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg) [ 34]. Blood was collected from the ophthalmic plexus for the separation of serum.Serum samples were obtainedby centrifugation of blood at 2683 gfor 20 min and stored at −20 ◦C.The kidneys were excised immediately for histological and biochemical analyses.Histological and immunohistochemical studies The kidneys were dissected and fixed in 10% formal saline forlater processing of paraffin sections.According to previously described protocols, approximately 5-μm renal sections were cut and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin [ 35], Mallory’s trichrome stain [ 36] and immunohistochemical staining using the peroxidase-labeled streptavidin–biotin method for detection of transforming growth factor- β(TGF- β1) antibody [ 37].The primary antibody used was mouse monoclonal antibody (Lab Ebrahim et al.53 Vision Corporation, Fremont, CA, USA).
It was ready for the staining of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. Thesections were incubated with the primary antibody diluted to a concentration of 1:100 in PBS for 1 h, followed by a reaction with a biotinylated secondary antibody.After conjugation withstreptavidin–biotin–peroxidase complex, 3,3-diaminobenzidine was used as a chromogen, and hematoxylin solution was used as a counterstain.The reaction gives brownish cytoplasmicdiscoloration.All tissue specimens were examined by Olympus LightMicroscope.Imageacquisitionwasperformedwithadigital microscope camera (Leica Qwin 500, Leica, England) computersystem.
For electron microscopy,according to Woods and Stirling [ 38], small renal cortex specimens (1 mm 3) were fixed in 2.5–3% glu- taraldehyde solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 at 4◦C for 2 h, followed by post-fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide at 4◦C for 30 min,then dehydrated in serial dilutions of ethanol and finally embeddedinepoxyresin(EpoxyEmbeddingMediumKit;Sigma).Ultra-thinsections(70nm)werecutusingLeicaUltramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate to be examined by JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL, Tokyo,Japan),at the Electron Microscope Unit,at Faculty of Agriculture, Mansoura University,Mansoura, Egypt. Morphometric study We used the image analysis computer system (Leica Qwin 500 MC, Leica, England), at the Faculty of Science, Tanta University,Tanta, Egypt.The image analyzer was first calibrated automat- ically to convert the measurement units (pixels) produced by the image analyzer program into actual micrometer units.
Itwas used to measure the area percent of collagen fibers depo-sition in Mallory’s Trichrome stained sections and the area per- cent of TGF- β1 immunoreaction, in all experimental groups. These measurements were performed in seven different, non-overlappingfieldsatamagnificationof400perslideinallgroups.The coloration of the TGF- β1 immunostained and trichrome- stained areas was covered automatically by a blue mask (binaryimage).Theareaofthisbinaryimagewasthencalculated,which reflected the areas of marked TGF- β1 immunoreactivity and excess collagen deposition.Biochemical analysis Assessment of kidney function biomarkers.Serum concentrations of urea and creatinine were measured colorimetrically using the commercially available assay kits (Biodiagnostic Company, Dokki, Giza, Egypt).Measurement of renal inflammatory biomarkers [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10)] and oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers [malondialdehyde (MDA) level and catalase (CAT) activity].
Renal levels of TNF- αand IL-10 were assessed by the com- merciallyavailableassayELISAkits(RayBiotech,USA).Bothrenal MDA level and CAT activity were measured colorimetrically bythe commercially available assay kits (Biodiagnostic Company, Dokki, Giza, Egypt). TNF- αand IL-10 were normalized per 100 μg protein sample.Assessment of renal caspase-3 activity.Renalactivityofcaspase-3 was assayed by the commercially available assay ELISA kits (RatCasp-3, My Biosource, USA).Gene expression analysis Sample preparation and RNA isolation.Total RNA was isolated from the kidney tissues according to the RNA isolation kit (Gen-tra, Minneapolis, MN 55441, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol.The purity and integrity of total RNA were monitored by “absorbance of ultraviolet spectrophotometer”at 260/280 nm.Reverse transcription and cDNA synthesis.For the synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA), the extracted RNA was reversetranscribed by QuantiTect SYBR Green RT–PCR kit (Qiagen; Cata- log No.
204243) as recommended by the manufacturer. Real-time polymerase chain reaction for mRNA gene expres- sion.Expression levels of mRNA were determined by real- time polymerase chain reaction using Step One TM System (Applied Biosystems).Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydroge- nase (GAPDH) used as an internal control.Primer sequenceswere reported in Table 1.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in 25 μl containing 12.5 μl QuantiFast SYBR Green (Cat.No.204141)PCRMasterMix,1mMofeachprimerInvitrogen,USA and 2 μl cDNA.The amplification conditions include initial activation 95 ◦C/15 s followed by 40 cycles of denaturation 94◦C/15 s, annealing at 60◦C/15 s, and elongation at 72◦C/15 s.The relative expression was calculated from the 2-/Delta1/Delta1CTformula.All kits were supplied by QIAGEN (Valencia, CA).
Statistical analysis Continuousvariablesarepresentedasthemean ±standarddevi- ation(SD).Wecheckedthenormalityofthecontinuousvariablesby Shapiro–Wilk test while the equality of variance by Bartlett’s test.We used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Welch’s ANOVA test according to equality of variance to detect statisticaldifferences between groups. Furthermore, post-hoc tests (Tukey test if equal variances are assumed; Tamhane’s T2 test if equal variances are not assumed) were performed for multiple com-parisons between groups.The differences were considered sig- nificant at P<0.05.All statistical comparisons were two-tailed.All statistical analyses were calculated using Graphpad Prism,Version 8.0 Software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
Results LCAR supplementation mitigated renal histopathological lesions induced by CDDP administration in rats Examination of H&E stained sections from the control and LCAR-supplemented rats is alike and reveals the normal renalhistoarchitecture. The renal corpuscles appeared with normal capillary tuft surrounded by Bowman’s capsule with patent Bowman’s (filtration) space in-between.The proximal convo-luted tubules (PCTs) were lined by cubical cells with acidophilicgranular cytoplasm, rounded vesicular nuclei and intact apical brushborder.Thedistalconvolutedtubules(DCTs)showedwider lumina and lined with low cubical cells with rounded nuclei(Fig.1a).CDDPgrouprevealedmarkedultrastructuralalterations.The tubular lining cells appeared swollen with almost loss of the patency of some renal tubules.Necrotic epithelial cellulardebris were seen inside the lumina of some renal tubules.
Many tubular cells showed vacuolated cytoplasm with loss of the apical brush border, others showed pyknotic nuclei. The renalinterstitium showed mononuclear cellular infiltrates and mild 54 Toxicology Research , 2021, Vol.10, No.1 Table 1: Oligonucleotide primer sequences used in the quantitative PCR measurement for Vim, Nes, Cx43, and GAPDH Gene Primers sequences GenBank®accession number Vim Forward: 5′- NM_031140.1 TTCTCTGGCACGTCTTGACC-3′ Reverse:5′- TCCTGTAGGTGGCGATCTCA-3′ Nes Forward: 5′- NM_012987.2 TGATGGCTTGAGAGGTGCTG-3′ Reverse:5′- AGGATCTCACCTCCCTTGCT-3′ Cx43 Forward: 5′- NM_012567.2 GGATTTTTGTGGTGTGGGCC-3′ Reverse:5′- ACTGTTGAAACCTCCCTCGC-3′ GAPDH Forward: 5′- NM_017008.4 TTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′ Reverse:5′- CCCAGGATGCCCTTTAGTGG-3′ Abbreviations: Vim, Vimentin; Nes, Nestin; Cx43, Connexin 43; GAPDH, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase congestion of some blood capillaries ( Fig.1b and c ).
LCAR supplementationalleviatedmostofthehistopathologicallesionsprovoked by CDDP treatment. Almost complete restoration ofthe renal microstructure was evident.The renal corpuscles showed normal glomeruli with normal filtration spaces.The/renal tubules appeared normal with preserved brushborders.Only minimal peritubular vascular congestion was seen (Fig.2d and e ).LCAR supplementation decreased renal TGF-β1 immunoexpression following CDDP administration in rats TGF-β1 immunostained sections are quite similar and showed a faint TGF- β1 cytoplasmic immunoexpression in glomeruli and renal tubules in the control and LCAR-supplemented groups(Fig.3a).The CDDP group showed a diffuse positive TGF- β1c y t o - plasmic immunoexpression in the glomeruli and renal tubules (Fig.3b).WhileLCARsupplementationelicitedanegativeTGF- β1 immunoexpression in renal tubules and a slightly positive TGF- β1 reaction in scarce glomeruli ( Fig.3c).
Morphometric analysis of renal tissues showed that mean TGF- β1 immunoexpression significantly increased in CDDP group than control, LCAR andCDDP +LCAR groups ( P<0.001, each) ( Fig. 5a).LCAR supplementation diminished renal collagen fiber deposition following CDDP administration in rats Mallory’s trichrome stained sections of the control group and LCAR-supplemented group demonstrated normally distributed collagen fibers around glomeruli and renal tubules within therenal cortex ( Fig.3d).However, the CDDP group displayed a marked collagen fibers deposition around the glomeruli and in renal interstitium ( Fig.2e).In CDDP +LCAR-treated rats, collagen fiber deposition was minimal around glomeruli and renal tubules ( Fig.2f).Morphometric analysis of renal tissues showed that mean area percent of collagen fiber dispositionhighly significantly increased in CDDP group than control,LCAR, and CDDP +LCAR groups ( P<0.001, each) ( Fig.
5a).LCAR supplementation reversed renal ultrastructural lesions induced by CDDP administration in rats UsingTEM,therenaltissuedidnotrevealsubstantialdifferences among rats in the control and LCAR-supplemented groups andit was parallel to the well-known normal ultrastructural pattern of PCTs and DCTs as well as renal glomeruli. PCTs lining cells appeared with euchromatic nuclei, closely packed long apicalmicrovilli, and elongated mitochondria ( Fig.4a).DCTs lining cells were low cubical cells, with euchromatic nuclei, few apical short microvilli basal membrane infoldings alternating with elongated mitochondria ( Fig.4d).Within the renal glomeruli, podocytes were irregular cells; each with a cell body and thick multiple primary processes.Each primary process gave rise to several secondary thin processes that ended in a pedicle-likeexpansionimplantingonathinglomerularbasementmembrane (Fig.4g).
In the CDDP group, the TEM examination displayed marked ultrastructural changes in PCTs and DCTs as well asrenal glomeruli. PCTs lining cells showed degenerative changes in the form of a damaged apical membrane with extrusion of cellular organelles into the lumen, a partial loss of the apicalmicrovilli, swollen mitochondria, and absent basal infoldings.Inaddition, cytoplasmic vacuoles and marked rarefaction (clear areas) of cytoplasm could be observed ( Fig.4b).DCTs lining cells showed interrupted basal infoldings, swollen pleomorphicmitochondria with detached dispersed cristae (cristolysis).The nucleushadlesselectrondensity.Cytoplasmappearedmarkedly rarefied with less electron density and many cytoplasmicvacuoles ( Fig.4e).The glomerular basement membrane showed focal irregular thickening.The podocytes showed an irregular nucleus with peripherally condensed chromatin.
The secondaryprocesses appeared thickened, closely related, and fused with obliteration of the filtration slits ( Fig. 4h).LCAR supplementation reversed the remarkable ultrastructural lesions elicited by CDDPtreatment.The renal tubular lining cells appeared with normaleuchromaticnuclei,preservedapicalmicrovilli,normallyshaped and normally oriented mitochondria ( Fig.4c and f ).The normal ultrastructure of the renal corpuscle is restored.The glomerularbasement membrane retained its normal thickness.The normal shape and thickness of primary and secondary processes of podocytes were restored with preserved filtration slits ( Fig.4i).Ebrahim et al.55 Figure 2 :(a)Therenalcortexofacontrolratshowingnormalglomerularstructure(G),surroundedbyBowman’scapsule(arrow),filtrationspace(ablackcircle ).Proximal convoluted tubules (P) have intact apical brush borders.The distal convoluted tubules (D) and collecting ducts (C) show normal morphology.

LCAR supplementation improved CDDP-induced deteriorated kidney function biomarkers in rats Mean serum urea and creatinine significantly increased in the CDDP group than control, LCAR, and CDDP +LCAR groups (P<0.001, each) ( Fig.5a).LCAR supplementation restored renal oxidant/antioxidant balance, dampened renal inflammation and antagonized caspase 3-mediatedapoptotic cell death following CDDP administration in rats We found that CDDP treatment significantly increased mean renal levels of MDA, the inflammatory TNF- αand caspase- 3 activity compared with control rats ( P<0.001, each), LCAR supplementation ( P<0.001, each), and CDDP +LCAR groups (P=0.036, P=0.011 and P<0.001, respectively).
Also, CDDP treatment significantly decreased mean renal CAT activity and the anti-inflammatory IL-10 level compared with control rats (P<0.001,each),LCAR ( P<0.001,each) and CDDP +LCAR groups (P<0.001 and P=0.027, respectively) ( Table 2).LCAR supplementation down-regulated renal cytoskeleton proteins encoding genes following CDDP administration in rats CDDP significantly up-regulated the mean expression levels of Vim, Nes, and Cx43 compared with the control group ( P<0.001, each)andLCAR-supplementedgroup( P<0.001,each).LCARsup- plementation significantly down-regulated their mean expres- sion levels following CDDP treatment ( P<0.001 each) ( Fig. 5b).Discussion Our resultssuggestedthecurativeroleofLCARsupplementation in a rat model of CDDP-induced kidney injury.Generally, CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity is widely accepted as a model for AKI [39,40].
The nephrotoxicity of CDDP might be mediated by the generationoffreeradicalsinresponsetoCDDPtreatmentleadingto oxidant–antioxidant imbalance and renal tissue injury [ 12, 40].
In this study, CDDP administration induced marked renal histological and ultrastructural degenerative changes in rats.ThesefindingswereconsistentwithastudyofAhmedandFouad Ebrahim et al.57 Table 2: Effects of LCAR on renal biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis pathway in CDDP-induced kidney injury in rats Parameter Groups Control LCAR CDDP CDDP +LCAR MDA (nmol/g) 19.5 ±5.1†20.1±3.2†37.5±6.7‡30.0±1.2§ CAT (U/g) 43.8 ±3.6†45.7±4.6†19.4±5.8‡34.6±6.9§ TNF- α(pg/100 μg protein) 8.9 ±1.9†9.5±2.8†22.5±3.0‡15.7±4.9§ IL-10 (pg/100 μg protein) 9.6 ±2.5†10.4±1.9†4.6±0.7‡6.4±1.5§ Caspase-3 (ng/g) 5.4 ±1.4†5.1±1.7†15.6±3.6‡8.6±0.9§ All values are expressed as mean ±SD,n=10, means in a row without a common symbol significantly differ ( P<0.05) by a one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or Welch’s one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tamhane’s T2 multiple comparisons test.

Bars notsharing the common superscript letters differ significantly at P<0.05.(b) Effects of LCAR on the relative mRNA expression levels of Vim, Nes, and Cx43 in renal tissues.Bars not sharing the common superscript letters differ significantly atP<0.05 [41] that reported marked ultrastructural damage in the kidney of CDDP-treated rats.A renal mitochondrial injury is an early event caused by CDDP [ 42].In our study, CDDP provoked mitochondrial structural impairment as documented by TEM.Mukhopadhyay [43] reported that the most protuberant ultrastructural finding of CDDP-induced renal impairment was mitochondrial swellingwith disruption of cristae practically in all tubular cells.
TGF-β1 is a proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokine that can potentiate the inflammatory process elicited in the renaltissue, after initial toxic insult [ 44,45]. Our study showed excess depositionofcollagenfibersinrenaltissuesfollowingCDDP.This massive deposition of collagen fibers could be illustrated by theoverexpression of TGF- β1,with subsequent collagen production.Several studies concluded similar findings [ 46].In the present study, CDDP-intoxicated rats showed up- regulationin the Vim,Nes,and Cx43 expression levels,mirroringthe altered podocytes function secondary to their injury as pre- sented by TEM [ 47].In corroboration, a study of Francescato and coworkers [ 48] showed overexpression of Vim immunostaining inthetubulointerstitialareaofrenaltissues.Vimoverexpression isamarkerofrenaltubularcellregeneration,indicativeofrecent injury [49,50].
Up-regulation of Nes provides more mechanical stability to the cells and enables the podocytes to undergo morphological changes that influence the glomerular capillary wall with the subsequent decline of the renal function [ 51]. Cx43 is a critical modulator of podocyte function in response to CDDP-induced renal injury.Besides, Cx43 has recently been incriminated in fibrosis and inflammation cascade.BluntingCx43 could mitigate renal damage and maintain its function[52].We found that LCAR supplementation for 15 successive days improved the renal histological, ultrastructural and biochemicalalterations elicited by CDDP.The biological functions of LCAR extend beyond its role in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix.Plenty of previous studies explored theefficacy of LCAR against different xenobiotics induced-organ toxicities [ 53–55].
We found that LCAR strongly alleviated mitochondrial dys- functioninratsexposedtoCDDPasseenbyTEM.Similarfindings were reported by Chang et al.[42]. LCAR mitigated inflammation and reduced TGF- β1i m m u n o - expression with subsequent minimal collagen accumulation inthe renal interstitium.In agreement, Rabie and coworkers [ 56] showed that LCAR reduced renal content of pro-inflammatory TNF-αand myeloperoxidase activity in a rat model of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury.The down-regulation of Vim,Nes,and Cx43 expression levels following LCAR supplementation in CDDP-treated rats could beexplained by its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic potentials [57–59].These cytoskeleton supporting proteins are not just pri- marily structural proteins.They are implicated in many biologi-cal processes such as cell motility and migration, cell signaling and division, tissue regeneration, in addition to inflammation and apoptosis [ 18,52].
Conclusions LCAR supplementation reversed the negative effects of CDDP in a rat model of CDDP-induced kidney injury. This will open novel perspectives for the utilization of LCAR in the treatmentofrenaldiseasesassociatedwithCDDPuse.Furthermore,unique therapiestargetingVim,Nes,and Cx43 blunting may be practical options for effectively inhibiting the renal toxicity in patientsreceiving CDDP.58 Toxicology Research , 2021, Vol.10, No.1 Conflict of interest statement The authors have no conflicts of interests.Funding The authors confirm they did not receive any funding to do this work.References 1.Gold JM, Raja A.Cisplatin (Cisplatinum) .Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing, 2020.2.WHO.World Health Organization model list of essential medicines, 21st list .Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization, 2019.https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/ 325771/WHO-MVP-EMP-IAU-2019.06-eng.pdf?ua =1.3.Dasari S, Bernard Tchounwou P.
