ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL CONTAMINANTS Review of New Trends in the Analysis of Allergenic Residues in Foods and Cosmetic Products Tomasz Tuzimski1and Anna Petruczynik2 1Medical University of Lublin, Department of Physical Chemistry, 4A Chodzki Street, Lublin, Poland, 20-093, 2Medical University of Lublin, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, 4A Chodzki Street, Lublin, Poland, 20-093 Corresponding author’s e–mail: tomasz.tuzimski@umlub.pl.Abstract Background: Allergies represent an important health problem in industrialized countries.Allergen sensitization is an important risk factor for the development of allergic diseases; thus, the identiﬁcation of an individual’s allergensensitization is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.Objective: This review compares different modern methods applied for the analysis of allergens in various matrices (from 2015 to the end of September 2019).Conclusions: Immunological methods are still most frequently used for detection of allergens.
These methods are sensitive, but the lack of speciﬁcity and cross-reaction of some antibodies can still be a relevant source of errors. DNA-based methodsare fast and reliable for determination of protein allergens, but the epitopes of protein allergens with posttranslationalmodiﬁcations and their changes, originated during various processing, cannot be identiﬁed through the use of this method.Methods based on application of biosensors are very rapid and easy to use, and can be readily implemented as screeningmethods to monitor allergens.Recent developments of new high-resolution MS instruments are encouraging and enabledevelopment in the analysis of allergens.Fast, very sensitive, reliable, and accurate detection and quantiﬁcation ofallergens in complex samples can be used in the near future.Mass spectrometry coupled with LC, GC, or electrophoreticmethods bring additional advances in allergen analysis.
The use of LC-MS or LC-MS/MS for the quantitative detection ofallergens in various matrices is at present gaining acceptance as a protein-based conﬁrmatory technique over the routinelyperformed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Allergies are an increasingly important public health problem, with implications for the general health status, economy, and legislation of a country ( 1).Allergy is a type of abnormal immune reaction, which is triggered by environmental antigensor allergens and mediated by Immunogloben E (IgE) antibodies.Allergic reactions to various allergens result from a dysfunction in, and the hypersensitivity (type I) of, the adaptive immune system against specific compounds.Theyrange from insignifi-cant skin symptoms to anaphylactic shock.Exposure to aller-gens can invoke hives, vomiting, itching, nausea, and asthma in sensitive individuals.
Allergy is one of the common causes of anaphylaxis, an acute and potentially deadly allergic reaction.Allergenic sources usually contain more than one allergenic substance e. g., protein.Within the same allergenic product there might be several substances capable of inducing allergic reactions.Small changes of allergen levels in foods or in theenvironment can lead to variations in allergenicity with poten-tial life-threatening implications for allergic patients.There is currently no cure for allergies, and sufferers can only rely on the correct labelling of various products to avoid allergens.Contamination of food by hidden allergens is a major healthproblem for food allergic patients.Hence, it is important that methods for their detection and analysis are accurate, sensitive, reliable, robust, fast, reproducible, and standardized.Received: 9 October 2019; Revised: 3 January 2020; Accepted: 16 January 2020 VCAOAC INTERNATIONAL 2020.All rights reserved.

Analysis is also a prerequisite for effective allergen avoidance.Specific and sensitive analytical methods, which allow for unequivocal identification and accuratequantification of allergenic components, are important tools in allergen risk management.Allergen analysis is also central to implementing and monitoring food allergen risk assessmentand management processes by the food industry.Over the past several decades, many effective techniques have been applied to ensure the labelling and management of food allergens.Determination of food allergens are based on detection of either proteins or nucleic acids.
Techniques based on protein detec- tion include immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immune sorbentassay (ELISA), and chromatography most often coupled with MSor MS/MS. PCR is the technique based on nucleic acids determi- nation.Currently, a combination of different methods is often applied for allergens analysis.A diagram of an example proce-dure for allergens analysis using different methods is shown in Figure 1 (2).The advantages of MS are that it is fast and can be used to analyze a number of allergens simultaneously, re-ducing total analysis time.The method is robust and stable and can easily be automated and standardized ( 3).However, the MS analysis of allergens requires additional steps that include pro-tein digestion to generate peptides and their introduction into the MS system for analysis.
An exemplary strategy for the analysis of allergens in food consists of a digestion stage,initial LC-MS or MS analysis, identification of signature peptides using bioinformatics tools, and quantification by LC-MS as is presented in Figure 2 (3). Methods for the Detection and Analysis of Allergens Immunological Methods Many different types of immunoassays currently exist.Immunoassays typically utilize antibodies for the detection of specific allergenic proteins which serve as markers for aller-gens.Immunological characterization of allergens is widelybased on the binding of IgE.In vivo skin prick testing (SPT) and in vitro serological assays are available to evaluate the presence of specific IgE to certain allergens in patients ( 4).Immunoassays, based on the specificity of antigen antibodyinteraction, are traditionally used for routine analysis, in partic- ular in the format of sandwich or competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Advantages and practical applications of ELISA and other immunological methods Different classes of antibodies can be applied for determination of allergenic proteins, including monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are used for the recognition of specific antigens due to the recognition of one epitope, whilepolyclonal antibodies recognize multiple epitopes spread on the proteins.ELISA is a rapid diagnostic test that is often used for routine detection of allergens ( 2,3).ELISA techniques use anti- bodies to selectively target allergens or specific marker proteins within investigated samples for detection.Once the allergen has been selectively bound by the antibody, an enzyme linkedto these causes a proportional color change.This change can be measured to give highly sensitive results.ELISA relies mainly on immune-recognition, which includes the specific immunereaction between at least one antibody and the antigen.
The an- tibody or antigen is firstly coated on the solid substrate. Next the solid substrate with coated antibody or antigen can be cap- tured by specific recognition and immobilized on the supporting substrate.Next, the enzyme labeled antibody is added and incu-bated with the antigen to form a bioconjugation that can cata- lyze the reaction of the chromogenic reagents.ELISA kits utilizing polyclonal antibodies raised against different allergensare currently widely used for determination of various aller- gens, especially food allergens.The performance of quantitative ELISAs depends on the choice of extraction buffer, the bindingof antibodies to its target, and the nature of the standards.Nano-ELISA is increasingly applied for detection of allergens.Compared with traditional ELISA, nano-ELISA have advantages in terms of sensitivity, accuracy, operations, and cost.All kinds Figure 1.

However, the fundamental basis of ELISA set- tles upon the analyte’s separation through specific solvents and, frequently, it does not involve a sample pretreatment pro- cedure; thus the endogenous components of the matrix are able to interact with the assay compounds or with the analyte. This outcome is called matrix effect and it is a sterling disadvantage of ELISA techniques.In sandwich ELISA assays the antigen present in the investi- gated sample is captured by a specific antibody immobilised on a solid surface forming an antigen-antibody complex.The com- plex reacts with a second analyte-specific antibody which isconjugated to an enzyme, forming a sandwich, and the enzyme reacts with a specific substrate developing a color.The concen-tration of the antigen-antibody complex, measured by the ab-sorbance of the colored product, is directly proportional to theamount of allergen present in the sample.
For example, anELISA kit for milk can target b-lactoglobulin or a different milk protein (e.g., casein) ( 5). Kobayashi et al.performed an investi- gation of the cross-reactivity of fish allergens applying ELISAexperiments ( 6).Sera obtained from patients with fish allergies and from healthy control donors were examined for IgE reactiv-ity to the purified Pacific mackerel parvalbumin and collagen and to the extract obtained from Anisakis simplex .In the ELISA test, authors demonstrated that pooled serum obtained from Figure 2.Signature peptide identity and characterization workﬂow for detection and quantiﬁcation of food allergens ( 2).Reprinted with permission from San Segundo- Acosta, P., Oeo-Santos, C., Benede ´, S., de los Rı ´os, V., Navas, A., Ruiz-Leon, B., Moreno, C., Pastor-Vargas, C., Jurado, A., Villalba, M., Barderas, R.(2019) J.Proteome Res.18, 3052/C03066.Copyright American Chemical Society.Tuzimski and Petruczynik: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol.103, No.
4, 2020 |999 patients with fish parvalbumin-specific allergies exhibited IgE reactivity to the extracts obtained from most fish species, and pooled serum obtained from patients with fish collagen-specific allergies displayed IgE reactivity to the extracts of all types offish. Various ELISA-based methods were applied for determina- tion of different allergens.Oyster allergen Cra g 1 was deter- mined by ELISA ( 7).In the investigations, authors initially used different immunoinformatics strategies to predict oyster(Crassostrea gigas ) tropomyosin epitopes.The potential epitopes were predicted by immunoinformatics tools and the resultant immunodominant epitopes were identified by inhibition ELISAwith pooled sera and individual serum from oyster allergicpatients.Surprisingly, homologous substitution of multiple amino acids led to an obvious decrease in affinity of IgE anti- bodies, but this method did not restrict binding completely.
Fivemajor linear epitopes were evenly distributed on the surface ofa homology-based Cra g 1 model and hydrophilic residues appeared to be the most important for IgE binding. After com- bining prediction by immunoinformatics tools, potential epi-tope peptides were synthesized and validated by inhibitionELISA using the pooled sera and randomly selected individual serum from oyster allergic patients.Additionally, the crucial amino acids within each of the Cra g 1 epitope were deter-mined.A homology-based three-dimensional model of Cra g 1was constructed for the explanation of the positional distribu- tion of IgE-binding epitopes in the allergen molecule.These results not only offer a better understanding of the molecularmechanism of interaction between Cra g 1 and oyster-specificIgE, but also have significance in clinical diagnosis and immunotherapy.
Detection of the food allergen glycinin, a soybean allergen in powdered milk, was performed by a lateral flow colloidal goldimmunoassay strip test in a sandwich format with a colloidalgold-labeled mouse antiglycinin monoclonal antibody and a rabbit antiglycinin polyclonal antibody ( 8). The test strip devel- oped by Wang et al.is composed of a sample pad, a conjugatereagent pad, an absorbent pad, and a test membrane containinga control line and a test line.The standard solution or sample extract is allowed to interreact with the colloidal gold-labeled mouse antiglycinin monoclonal antibody.The mixture thenmoves upward on the nitrocellulose membrane chromato-graphically via capillary action.For a positive sample, glycinin binds to the mouse antiglycinin monoclonal antibody, forming a gold/antigen/antibody complex, which binds to the rabbitantiglycinin polyclonal antibody and forms a red color band inthe test region.
A stronger line color indicates higher amounts of glycinin in the investigated sample. An optical density scan- ner that measures relative optical density was applied to quan-tify the color reaction.The LOD obtained by application of thetest strip with an optical density scanner was 0.69 mg/kg.An ELISA procedure was applied for determination of allergens in crab ( Charybdis feriatus ), one of the main causes of food allergy in Taiwan ( 9).Several proteins are recognized as crustacean allergens, and tropomyosin is known to be the major one.The allergic response between allergens in crucifix crab (C.feriatus ) and specific-IgEs in patients’ sera was investigated, in search for a novel allergen.For quantification of topomyosinlevel Crustacean Tropomyosin ELISA KitSeveral was applied in the procedure.In addition, the effect of heating on tropomyo- sin levels in both raw and cooked crabs was examined.
Various undeclared food allergens in cumin were detected by multiplex methods: ELISA, SDS-PAGE protein electrophoresis and western blot, PCR, and LC-MS/MS analysis ( 10). In theinvestigation, ELISA was applied for determination of almond, hazelnut, and peanut allergens present in cumin samples.Initial analysis of the almond and peanut samples was under- taken using commercially available almond and peanutELISAs ( 11).Further investigation was performed by HPLC-MS/ MS.Antibody-based methodologies used to determine whether peanut was present in the cumin samples generated quantita- tive inconsistencies and a complex antigenic profile.It wasnecessary to apply DNA- and MS-based methods capable ofdetecting multiple biomarkers.However, accurate quantitation of peanut in the contaminated cumin was not possible.
For example, if an immunoassay detected primarily Ara h 3 andused calibration standards that contained Ara h 3 as thepredominant allergen protein, it would incorrectly assess the peanut content and potential allergenicity of the cumin sam- ples. Obtained results demonstrate the limitations of singleanalyte-specific assays and the need for orthogonal multiplexmethods to detect food allergens irrespective of varietal or other differences.Parke et al.used quantitative ELISA kits for determination of egg, milk, and peanut allergens in baked goods ( 12).They com- pared the performance of commercial immunochemical assays: Morinaga Egg, Milk, and Peanut; Neogen BioKits Peanut; ELISA Systems; Neogen Veratox Egg, Milk, and Peanut; and R-Biopharm RIDASCREEN FAST Ei/Egg Protein, Milk, Peanut withthat of a multi-allergen MS method for the detection and quan- titation of allergens in baked good.
The Morinaga ELISA and LC- MS/MS quantitative methods exhibited the highest recovery forall determined allergens, whereas the ELISA Systems, NeogenBioKits, Neogen Veratox, and R-Biopharm ELISA Kits underper- formed in the determination of investigated allergens in the bakery products. An ELISA method was applied for the quantita-tive analysis of almond allergen protein residues in variousfood products, such as cookies, crackers, chocolate bars, cereals, beverages, and clean-in-place rinses ( 13).Quantification of al- mond protein residues was performed with Veratox for AlmondAllergen kits ranging from 2.5 to 25 ppm.Ecker et al.compared the suitability of two competitive ELISAs, one sandwich ELISA and a novel real-time PCR method for the detection of lupine in four different highly processed model foods (bread, biscuits, rice patties, and noodles) ( 14).All ELISA experiments were carried out in flat-bottom polystyrenemicrotiter plates.
Authors compared results obtained by three in-house ELISAs including one sandwich ELISA and two com- petitive ELISAs. The sandwich ELISA proved to be the most sen-sitive method compared to a real-time PCR.The LODs obtainedby repeatedly analyzing extracts from blank food matrices were in the range of 5 to 20 ppm (IgG ELISA) and 3 to 34 ppm lupine protein (IgY ELISA), corresponding to 17 to 77 ppm lupine and 11to 126 ppm lupine, respectively.The LODs obtained by the sand-wich ELISA were substantially lower (from 0.1 to 0.6 ppm lupine protein, corresponding to 0.4 to 2.3 ppm lupine).Based on the results, the authors concluded that the sandwich ELISA provedto be the most sensitive method applied in the investigations(competitive ELISAs, sandwich ELISA, and a novel real-time PCR) for determination of lupine in highly processed foods ( 14).Ito et al.developed a novel human- and eco-friendly ELISA in which harmful reagents were eliminated ( 15).
For determina- tion of food allergens by this ELISA, sodium sulfite as potential reductant for the replacement of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) was investigated. Next, the ELISA performance for egg, milk, wheat,peanut, and buckwheat was evaluated.The protein extractioncapability of SDS/0.1 M sodium sulfite solution was similar to that of SDS/2-ME solution.The ELISA performance for egg, milk,1000 | Tuzimski and Petruczynik: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol.103, No.4, 2020 wheat, peanut, and buckwheat was also estimated by using model-processed foods and commercially available food prod- ucts.The food allergen recoveries of the novel SDS/0.1 M sulfite ELISAs corresponded with those of the SDS/2-ME ELISAs.Allergens from cashew nuts were separated by SDS-PAGE andanalyzed by immunoblot and ELISA, with rabbit anti-cashew polyclonal sera and human serum IgE ( 16).Allergen soy proteins were detected by ELISA after separation by SDS-PAGE ( 17).
Before SDS-PAGE procedure samples were prepared by micro-wave or ultrasound assisted extraction. The authors compared conventional extraction procedures, microwave, and ultra- sound assisted extraction on protein recovery and concludedthat the application of microwave and ultrasound assisted ex-traction techniques improve recovery of allergens from various soy matrices.The use of ultrasound assisted extraction and conventional extraction in combination with a stronger bufferlike Laemmli, proved to be a very efficient extraction process es-pecially for soy protein isolate and soy milk.ELISA was also applied for determination of major mite allergens ( 18), gibberellin-regulated allergen protein in orange (19), almond and hazelnut allergens ( 20), soybean allergen Gly m4( 21), allergens from coconut pollen ( 22), protamine, the al- lergen from the milt of the large yellow croaker ( Pseudosciaena crocea )(23).Lu et al.
identified the IgE binding proteins from soybean us- ing sera from soy-allergic subjects and plasma from soy-sensitized subjects ( 24). In the procedure, proteins from gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblots.The membranes were completely dried, fixedand stained.After the images, the membranes were rehydratedwith methanol and blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk.Individual soybean allergic or non-allergic sera were diluted with soybean-specific IgE and incubated with the membranesovernight.Bound IgE was detected using monoclonal anti-human IgE.Bound anti-IgE was detected with SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescent substrate ( 24).IgE reactive recombinant egg white allergens expressed in Escherichia coli were determined by immunological analysis ( 25).In the investigations, produced IgE reactive recombinant egg allergens and their natural counterparts were compared.Egg white was separated from the egg yolk and was diluted withdH 20.
The diluted egg white was run on gels and blotted onto ni- trocellulose. The blots were then cut into individual lane strips.The nitrocellulose strips with immobilized egg white proteins were then incubated with each diluted serum sample overnightat 4 /C14C.Next, the strips were incubated with an anti-human IgE secondary antibody produced in a mouse.The detection was carried out using the WesternBreezeVRChromogenic kit.SDS-PAGE were immunologically analyzed using egg yolk al- lergic patients’ sera ( 26).Western immunoassay performed with individual patients sera against crude egg yolk extract showed that multiple egg yolk proteins reacted with IgE from egg white allergic patients sera.In the study, the authorsinvestigated whether sensitization to egg white is associatedwith reactivity to egg yolk as well.They suggest that the major- ity of patients sensitive to egg white are immunologically reac- tive towards yolk proteins as well.
Therefore, in those patients,development of an allergy can be attributed to allergens derivedfrom both the albumen and yolk. Furthermore, these results suggest that there are potentially undiscovered allergens within hens’ egg yolk.In the procedure, crude egg yolk in coating bufferwas used to coat each well of an ELISA microtitre plate.Afterwashing the wells with phosphate buffered saline with Tween 20, each well was blocked with bovine serum albumin inphosphate buffered saline for 2 h at 37 /C14C.Next, the wells were triple washed with phosphate buffered saline with Tween-20, each coated well was incubated with control serum and serum pools which were pre-incubated with different amounts ofrYGP42 for 1 h at room temperature.Following triple washingwith phosphate buffered saline with Tween-20, all wells were incubated with monoclonal anti-human IgE mouse antibodies labelled with alkaline phosphatase for 1 h at 37 /C14C.
After washing the wells, alkaline phosphatase Yellow liquid substrate wasadded to each well and incubated at 37 /C14C. After color develop- ment and addition of 3M NaOH the absorbance value was mea- sured at 405 nm.A second ELISA was done on wells of themicrotitre plate coated with rYGP42 protein in coating buffer.The test serum pool was pre-incubated in crude egg yolk.The absorbance was measured at 405 nm and the percentage of inhi- bition was calculated.Additionally, the IgE reactive proteinbands were excised from a SDS-PAGE gel and determined byLC-MS/MS analysis to reveal their identity.Preliminary investigations of egg allergens were also per- formed by ELISA comprising a monoclonal antibody generatedvia an analyte specific peptide antigen and sodium laurylsulfate/sulfite solution ( 27).The aim of the investigation was to develop an egg allergen ELISA that can harmonize with LC-MS analysis.
In the experiment a monoclonal antibody to an oval-bumin (OVA)-specific amino acid sequence was generated anddeveloped by an ELISA combined with sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS)/sulfite reaction solution. Detection of OVA-specific tryptic peptide conforming to the target amino acid sequence of ELISAmonoclonal antibody was detected by LC-MS/MS analysis.Thecomparison of LC-MS/MS and the new ELISA, which targets the amino acid sequence conforming to the LC-MS/MS detection peptide, showed a good compatibility.For determination of allergens from Chinese shrimp ( Penaeus chinensis ), the IgE binding epitopes and critical amino acids of two major allergens were applied ( 28).The inhibitory dot-blot assay, indirect competition ELISA (icELISA), and LAD2 cell de- granulation assay were used in the investigations to detectthe binding affinity and antigenicity of the allergenic epitopes.The immunoinfo-CB method was applied to identify the critical amino acids of the confirmed allergenic epitopes.
In the procedure, peptide icELISA, 100 lL/C20.5 mg/mL of tropomyosin or arginine kinase protein were coated on 96-well plates in car-bonate buffer overnight at 4 /C14C. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin/0.01 M pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at 37/C14C, the plates were incubated with individual serum samples and indicated peptide for 1.5 h at 37/C14C.Next, the plates were incubated with horseradish peroxidase goat antihuman IgE serum for 1.5 h at 37/C14C.The plates were then developed with tetramethylbenzidine substrate reagent, set in a darkenvironment for 15 min at 37 /C14C and terminated by H 2SO4.Absorbance was measured at 450 nm.Sandwich ELISA was used for quantification of Gly m 4, a soybean allergen ( 21).ELISA was carried out to determine the titers of goat sera, mouse sera, andthe hybridoma cell lines.Soy allergy is among the most common forms of food al- lergy.
Soy allergens in food samples are currently detected in most cases using ELISAs based on antibodies raised againstbulk soybean proteins or specifically targeting soybean trypsininhibitor, conglycinin, or glycinin, but the results are often in- correct because the antibodies cross-react with other proteins. Ueberham et al.developed a monoclonal antibody-basedsandwich ELISA targeting the soybean 2S albumin Gly m 8 soyallergen to detect traces of soy proteins in food samples ( 29).The various commercial ELISAs lack standardized referenceTuzimski and Petruczynik: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol.103, No.4, 2020 |1001 material, and the results are often inaccurate because the antibodies cross-react with proteins from other legumes.Furthermore, the isolation of allergenic proteins involves labori- ous denaturing extraction conditions.
The authors developed anovel sandwich ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies raisedagainst the soybean 2S albumin Gly m 8 and a recombinant Gly m 8 reference protein with native-analogous characteristics. The antibodies do not cross-react with other legume proteins,and the extraordinary stability and solubility of Gly m 8 allowsit to be extracted even from complex matrices after processing.In the ELISA procedure the capture antibody (mAb3) was immo- bilized onto 96-well plates carbonate buffer at 4 /C14C overnight.The plates were washed three times with phosphate-bufferedsaline containing NaCl and Tween-20 and then blocked with Superblock blocking reagent at room temperature.The plates were then sealed, air-dried, shrink-wrapped, and stored at roomtemperature.In the next step, extracted samples were incu-bated for 10 min at room temperature, also in duplicate with Tween-20 and Superblock mixture.
After three washes in Tween-20, the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated detection an-tibody (mAb8) was added, and the plates were incubated for10 min at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase activity was determined by incubating the plate with 3,3 0,5,50-tetrame- thylbenzidine substrate.The yellow color generated by treat-ment with sulfuric acid represented the quantity of bounddetection antibodies and was measured at 450 nm.Surface plas- mon resonance spectroscopy was used to detail the characteri- zation of the activity and binding parameters of the antibodies.Application of this ELISA test, allows obtained LOD and LOQ val-ues of Gly m 8 higher then 10 pg/mL and 65 pg/mL, respectively.2-D immunoblot analysis was rarely applied for detection of allergens e.g., for determination of the catalase allergen frombanana ( 30).For allergogram analysis banana protein extract was mixed with buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, glycerol and bromphenolblue and incubated for 5 min at 95 /C14C.
Next, banana fruit proteins were resolved by 1-D SDS PAGE and then wereelectrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The transferwas performed by using semi-dry transfer buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, 0.0375 (w/v) SDS, pH 8.3.After blocking with Tris buffered saline containinghuman serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature, IgE reactiveproteins were detected by using individual sera of patients with suspected allergy to banana.The stripes were incubated with polyclonal goat anti-human IgE for 1 h, followed by 1 h of incu-bation with alkaline phosphatase-labeled polyclonal rabbitanti-goat IgG tertiary antibodies.Visualization of the reaction was achieved with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/ 4-nitroblue tetrazolium.IgE reactive banana protein specieswere determined in the wide range of molecular masses andisoelectric points.
ELISA was also applied for determination of coconut pollen allergens, lupine allergen, and milk protein residues in Cheddar cheese ( 22,31,32). The identification of IgE binding proteins is important to achieve a better understanding of allergens forallergy diagnosis, identification of possible immunotherapy reagents, and for risk assessment and risk management of products containing allergens.The multiplexing capacity ofELISA makes it highly effective in screening multiple allergenicfoods such as peanuts and tree nuts.However, ELISA-based methods for determination of aller- gens have some disadvantages.Antibody-based methods re-quire the availability of either monoclonal or polyclonalantibodies, preferably both.Many antibodies are commercially available, however they are often weakly characterized.Theperformance of immunological methods such as ELISA can be unfavorably affected by issues of cross-reactivity, hook effects, and extensive food processing.
A major reason for the variabil- ity of methods based on immuno tests are processing-inducedmodification of allergens and the physical form of allergenicingredients together with the nature of the food matrix. Food processing or sample preparation can modify allergens, which then may not be recognized by the target antibody, leading tofalse-negative results.The various commercial ELISAs oftenlack standardized reference material, and the results can be in- accurate since the antibodies cross-react with other proteins.Quantitative results obtained for allergens analyzed in complexmatrices by ELISAs sometimes exhibit differences which canarise due to limitations in protein extraction, lack of standard reference materials, variations in batch and cultivar sampling, or epitope modifications due to food processing ( 33).addition, ELISA-based methods are strongly limited in the detection ofmultiple allergens.
Examples of application of ELISA for aller- gens determination are presented in Table 1 . Detection of allergenic ingredients by DNA analysis DNA-based methods offer an alternative to immunological methods.DNA-based methods do not analyze protein directly, but instead detect the gene which encodes for that protein.TheDNA-based test involves the extraction of a specific allergenprotein encoding fragment that is followed by amplification by PCR ( 33).The most frequently applied DNA-based methods are: PCR-ELISA; real-time PCR; PCR peptide nucleic acid HPLC; du-plex PCR; and multiplex real-time PCR.PCR Nucleic acid-based PCR methods are often used for determina- tion of allergens especially for qualitative and quantitative de-termination of food allergens.PCR is highly specific but may notbe representative of the quantity of allergenic protein content of a sample.
Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was ap- plied for comparative analysis of allergen genes and pro-inflammatory factors in the pollen and fruit of apple varieties (36). Gene expression levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR, then ap- plied with SYBR green based assays and specific primer pairs.The expression, production, and activation of sensitizing factors(specific allergens expression, ROS production, TGase, and PLA2 activity) were investigated in relation to the known allergenic potential of apple varieties ( 36).Ladenburger et al.developed two competitive real-time PCR assays for the quantitative determination of trace amounts of two major food allergens, peanut and soybean based on com- petitive real-time PCR primer pairs and probes targetingspecies-specific mitochondrial sequences: atp6 in peanut andbait8 in soybean ( 37).
In the procedure food samples were ground, aliquots were incubated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide extraction buffer (2% cetyltrimethylammonium bro-mide, 1.4 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, and 20 mM EDTA; pH 8) for90 min at 65 /C14C with 0.6 mg proteinase K. The next samples were incubated and centrifuged.Supernatants were transferred to a mixture of chloroform and isoamylalcohol (24 þ1, v/v).After mixing, the samples were centrifuged and DNA containingaqueous phase were transferred into a reaction tube and mixed with isopropanol.After 30 min at room temperature, the DNA was precipitated by centrifugation.The supernatant wasdiscarded and the resulting DNA pellet washed with 70% etha- nol.After an additional centrifugation the supernatant was discarded again and the pellet air-dried at room temperature.1002 | Tuzimski and Petruczynik: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol.103, No.4, 2020 Table 1.

103, No. 4, 2020 |1003 The DNA pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 10mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA,(pH 8) supplemented with RNase A for 60 min at 50/C14C.The DNA extracts were purified on a column.After purification samples were eluted with elution buffer and the concentration of the DNA was determined by spectrometry and analyzed by competitive real-time PCR.Amplification reac-tions were performed with SsoAdvanced Universal Probes Supermix template and each primer pair.Coamplification of competitor DNA occurred in the presence of equimolar concen-trations of competitor probes.Real-time PCR reactions were run on a CFX96 real-time PCR System with an initial denaturation step at 95 /C14C for 3 min, followed by 45 two-step cycles at 95/C14C for 15 s and 60/C14C for 30 s.Relative fluorescence signals were recorded after each cycle.
The higher detection sensitivity wasobtained by determination of targeting mitochondrial DNA sequences for allergen detection compared to nuclear DNA de- termination. It was achieved by the fact that there are more mi-tochondrial DNA copies than nuclear DNA copies per cell can be obtained.A real-time PCR method was also applied for detection of lupine in four different highly processed model foods (bread, biscuits, rice patties, and noodles) ( 14).Results obtained by real- time PCR were compared with those obtained by ELISA sand- wich.The sensitivity of the methods was significantly different; lupine was detected in eight out of the 25 investigated productswith the sandwich ELISA but not by real-time PCR ( 14).By seri- ally diluting the lupine DNA extract the LOD of 20 pg/lL, corre- sponding to an amount of 100 pg lupine DNA was determined.The LODs obtained in the investigations by real-time PCR were significantly higher than those of the ELISAs especially sand- wich ELISA.
For this reason, the real-time PCR method targetinga sequence of the gene coding for the tRNA nucleotidyltransfer- ase (CCA1) mRNA, was not recommended by authors for detect- ing traces of lupine in processed foods. Various food allergens (almond, cashew, hazelnut, peanut, pistachio, and walnut) in cumin were determined by PCR ( 10).The DNA-based analysis consisted of a combination of gene- specific methods, such as PCR, real-time PCR, and Sanger se- quencing using universal plant primers.Using PCR analysis, the peanut genes Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 3 were determined incumin samples, with the Ara h 3 amplicons confirmed by se- quencing.LOQ obtained through the PCR method was 4 mg/kg.Sometimes inconsistencies among the various PCR analyseswere observed.The authors explained that these inconsisten- cies were due to differences in assay sensitivity and/or primer sets that are not suitable for all nut varieties.
A multiplex PCR (MPCR) assay combined with capillary elec- trophoresis (CE) was developed for simultaneously detecting ten common food allergens from hazelnut, pistachio, oat, sesame, peanut, cashew, barley, wheat, soybean, and pecan(Figure 3 )(38). The procedure of the MPCR method was applied for determination of allergens in 20 commercial food products, including cake, cookies, crackers, waffles, cocktail nuts, Quakerrolled oats, fruit juice, noodles, pistachios, chocolate, mixed nuts, milk, candy, soy milk, and powdered beef soup.The authors concluded that this MPCR assay could be used for rou-tine simultaneous detection of multiple food allergens in vari-ous matrices.Prior to analysis, DNA was extracted and purified with a Plant Genomic DNA Isolation Kit according to the manu- facturer’s instructions.Food allergens were tested and MPCRprimers were designed based on published DNA sequences of selected allergen genes.
First, simplex PCR amplification of each allergen was performed to check primer specificity and se-quence authenticity of amplified target DNA. Next, the expected PCR amplicons of target allergen genes by simplex PCR were se- quenced to confirm sequence authenticity.Subsequently, the fi-nal optimized multiplex PCR was carried out which contained PCR buffer, template DNA, and ten pairs of primers (pistachio, pecan, hazelnut, sesame, wheat, soybean, cashew, oat, peanut,and barley) at different concentrations.The multiplex PCR wasperformed with the following program: denaturation at 95 /C14C for 10 min; 35 cycles of denaturation at 95/C14C for 30 s, annealing at Figure 3.Simultaneous detection of 10 food allergens by optimized decaplex PCR assay using mixed genomic DNA as template (2000 copies haploid genome of each allergen).

A multiplex real-time PCR assay was applied fordetermination of citrus fruit allergens and for monitoring of the expression of citrus allergen genes ( 39). First, four optimal singleplex systems were established by selecting the primerand probe concentrations with a suitable amplification effi- ciency.Total RNA was isolated from plant materials (peels and pulps) and applied with Trizol reagent.Contaminating DNA wasdigested with DNase I.Total RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers using a Prime-Script First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit.The information on sweet orange allergens wasobtained from the WHO-IUIS database.
To identify new mem- bers of citrus allergen gene families, in silico analysis of the ge- nome information, nucleotide, and protein sequences of citrusallergens were used to blast the sweet orange genome based on calculating the statistical significance of matches and protein domains were also an important determinant for new citrusallergens since they contained Cupin_1 domain, Profilin domain, and Tryp_alpha_amyl domain, respectively. TaqMan real-time PCR reactions were performed by an AppliedBiosystems 7500 Real Time PCR System with application AceQ UþProbe Master Mix containing heat-labile uracil /C0DNA glyco- sylase.The same primer sequences for the singleplex reactionswere used for the multiplex PCR.Similar LOD values were obtained in simple and multiplex real-time PCR.LOD values obtained by both methods for primer Cit s 1.01 were 200 fg andfor primers Cit s 2.01 and Cit s 3.01 were 20 fg.
Reverse transcrip- tion PCR (RT-PCR) using One Step RT-PCR kit was performed for egg yolk allergens ( 26). PCR is sensitive and can be used for the determination of allergens in trace concentrations.Real-time PCR is a fast, highly sensitive, and reproducible technique to study allergen geneexpression.Recent developments of nucleic acid-based biosen- sors, their miniaturization, and increasing application of nanotechnology, has significantly supported further applicationof the strategies.However, lack of specificity and cross-reaction of some antibodies can be an important source of false results.The interference and enzyme inhibitors (giving rise to falsenegatives) and poor DNA recovery from samples can be ad- versely affected on the performance of PCR-based methods.Also, it is not possible to trace protein allergen epitopes withpost-translational modifications and their changes arising dur- ing food processing using the method.Additionally, PCR is not tissue specific.
Biosensors and Chips Another technology in allergen analysis is the application ofbiosensors consisting of an integrated receptor-transducer device, which is capable of providing selective quantitative or semi-quantitative information using a biological recognitionelement. Biosensors are an attractive alternative to traditional immunoassay methods offering comparable sensitivities and selectivity while allowing for on-site detection.A number ofpapers have reported the use of biosensors based on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), surface plasmon resonance (SPR),and electrochemical sensors ( 40–42).SPR biosensors are based on a special mode of metal-dielectric waveguides, the surface plasmon, to measure the refractive index changes caused by the interaction of biomolecules with the surface of SPR biosen-sors.The surface plasmons are delocalized electron oscillations,which exist at the interface of a metal-dielectric medium.
SPR is a highly sensitive optical sensing technology relying on the interactions of light with the free electrons in a semi-transparent noble metallic layer or chip and can realize the real-time monitoring of small changes in the effective refractive index of a metal-dielectric interface. molecule capable of hy-bridizing with an allergen-specific DNA fragment.Biosensors allow for the real-time detection of compounds by interact with an immobilized target molecule.This target mole- cule can be an antibody raised against an allergen or a singlestranded DNA.DNA biosensors containing the immobilization of a DNA probe onto the transducer surface.Biosensors contain a biological recognition element (biochemical receptor) in directspatial contact with a transducer, which converts the recogni-tion event into a measurable chemical or physical signal, con- nected to a data acquisition and processing system.
Biosensors contain a biological recognition component, a signal transduc-tion (and signal amplification) device, that is connected to a computer for both data acquisition and processing. The reaction between the target and sensing molecule can be further sensedand amplified ( 33,40,42).The most frequently used amplifica- tion methods are nanomaterial-enhanced, enzyme based, and DNA-based amplifications ( 33,42).Other methods often used for detection are based on voltammetry, amperometry, electro-chemiluminescence, photoelectrochemistry, and impedance.Biosensors are an attractive alternative to traditional immuno- assay methods offering comparable sensitivities and selectivitywhile allowing for on-site detection.
Based on a combination of an amperometric transduction, magnetic particles, and disposable screen-printed electrodes, a shrimp tropomyosin immunosensor having a sandwich struc-ture composed of a capture antibody, a detection antibody and an horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary anti- body has been developed and optimized for detection of traceamounts of shrimp ( 41). The sensor is based on the implemen- tation of a sandwich immunoassay format on the surface of magnetic beads (MBs) and their coupling onto disposable screen- printed electrodes to register the amperometric re-sponse at 200mV vs Ag pseudo-reference electrode.H2O2 was applied as the enzymatic substrate and hydroquinone was used as the redox mediator.All the steps involved in the specific cap-ture and labelling of the shrimp tropomyosin were performedwith magnetic microbeads or in-house made magnetic nano- particles, using a sandwich format.
In the sensor, HOOC- modified magnetic particles were activated throughcarbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide to covalently bind poly- clonal rabbit anti shrimp tropomyosin capture antibodies; the unbound active sites were blocked using ethanolamine hydro-chloride to avoid any succeeding nonspecific binding events.These functionalized magnetic microbeads and magnetic nano- particles were then applied to specifically catch shrimp tropo- myosin; finally, bound shrimp tropomyosin was sandwichedthrough a detector shrimp tropomyosin antibody and a second- ary labeled antibody. The magnetic microbeads or magnetic nanoparticles with the sandwich immunocomplexes weretransferred to the surface of the working electrode of the sens-ing electrodes to perform the amperometric detection upon the addition of the H 2O2enzymatic substrate.Tuzimski and Petruczynik: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol.103, No.
4, 2020 |1005 For the detection of a-casein in rinse water samples of clean- ing in place systems of food manufacturers an immunoassaybased a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor chip consistingof four sensing arrays was developed. The sensor allows for the measurement of samples and control allergen binding events simultaneously ( 42).Caseins are a significant fraction of milk protein and the detection of a-casein would be a useful marker for monitoring levels of milk during the cleaning-in-place sys- tem.A sensor chip was used to immobilize an a-casein- polyclonal antibody using an 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopro-pyl)car-bodiimide/N-hydro-xysuccinimide coupling procedure.The sensor exhibited sub ppm sensitivity and good selectivity for a-casein detection.LOD obtained by application of the sensor was equal to 57.80 ng/ML, while LOD for commercially availableELISA kit is 2.5 ppm.Hideshima et al.
proposed a label-free field effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing system for the detection of a buckwheat allergenic protein, BWp16, by surfactant-induced signal amplifi- cation ( 43). BWp16 was detected by coupling with an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate use to receive the signal am- plification.This coupling enhanced the net charge of the protein enough to be detected by FET biosensors ( 43).The conception of the signal amplification is based on the increase of total chargesof target molecules by charged additives within the charge- detectable region for FET-based detection.Coupling BWp16 with SDS molecules is an effective way to induce enough addi-tional charges to be detected by FET biosensors.The optimal SDS concentration for coupling with the target protein was opti- mized and was found to be 1% (w/w).
The coupling of SDS mole-cules was verified by application of fluorescence spectroscopy.Authors observed a significant response when the allergen was coupled with SDS, while the responses were decreased or unchanged when it was coupled with a cationic or non-ionicsurfactant. It indicating that the SDS coupling supports theantibody recognition ability of the target allergen.For this the application of SDS can be useful to increase the sensorresponses.The application of the sensor with the signal amplifi-cation obtained LOD ¼10 ng/mL.An electrochemical nucleic acid biosensor was applied for the sensitive and selective determination of PCR-free and selec-tive detection of the Sola l 7 allergen by targeting a 60-mer spe-cific fragment of its coding sequence in tomato seeds ( 44).A schematic display of the fundamentals involved in the nucleicacid biosensing platform prepared for the determination of aspecific fragment of the Sola l 7 allergen coding sequence ispresented in Figure 4 .
In the biosensor, DNA/RNA heterohybrids by sandwich hybridization of a specific fragment of the Sola l 7 allergen were formed. Labeling was performed with commercial antibodies specific to the heteroduplexes and secondary anti-bodies conjugated with HRP onto the surface of magnetic beads.Amperometric transduction was carried out upon magneticcapture of the resulting magnetic bioconjugates on screen-printed electrodes using the system H 2O2/HQ.The biosensor offers the possibility of tailoring the sensitivity by varying thebioassay format, heterohybrid length, or labeling strategy usingnew low-cost, simple to fabricate, disposable, electrochemicalmast cell-based paper.Jiang et al.developed an electrochemical mast cell sensor to determine the major milk allergen casein ( 45).
In the sensor, carbon nanofiber/graphene-modified screen-printed electrodes formed an effective cell immobilization layer and allowed the immobilized mast cells to have high stability and bioactivity.The casein antibody-sensitized mast cells were immobilized onthe paper fibers through the biological affinity of the Gelatinmethacryloyl hydrogel. The sensor exhibited an irreversible vol-tammetric response related to the response of mast cells to theallergen and the peak current showed a positive relationshipwith the concentration of casein.Schematic representation of Figure 4.Schematic display of the magnetic beads (MBs)-based amperometric biosensing strategy developed at surface plasmon coupled emissions (SPCEs) for t arget- ing a speciﬁc fragment of the Sola l 7 allergen coding sequence ( 44).Reprinted with permission from Pereira-Barros, M.A., Barroso, M.F., Martı ´n-Pedraza, L., Vargas, E., Benede ´, S., Villalba, M., Rocha, J.M., Campuzano, S., Pingarro ´ n, J.M.(2019) Biosens.

Copyright Elsevier.1006 | Tuzimski and Petruczynik: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol.103, No.4, 2020 the fabrication and procedure of the electrochemical mast cell- based paper sensor is presented in Figure 5 .The LOD obtained by application of the sensor for determination of casein was 3.2/C210/C08g/mL.An elelectrochemical rat basophilic leukemia cell (RBL-2H3) cell sensor, based on fluorescent magnetic beads, has been de- veloped for the determination of different allergens in food-stuffs ( 46).In the sensor, fluorescein isothiocyanate was fused inside the SiO 2layer of SiO 2shell-coated Fe 3O4nanoparticles.The as-synthesized fluorescent magnetic beads were then en-capsulated with lipidosome to form cationic magnetic fluores-cent nanoparticles for mast cell magnetofection.The cationicmagnetic fluorescent nanoparticles were then transfected into rat basophilic leukemia cell (RBL-2H3) using a highly efficient, lipid-mediated magnetofection procedure.
A magnetic glassycarbon electrode was then employed to adsorb the cationicmagnetic fluorescent nanoparticles transfected RBL-2H3 cellsactivated by an allergen antigen for electrochemical assay. Todemonstrate the utility of this mast cell-based biosensor for de-tection of real allergens in foodstuffs, Anti-Pena1IgE an dAnti-PV IgE activated cells were employed to quantify both shrimp allergen tropomyosin (Pena1) and fish allergen parvalbumin.The sensor can be applied for determination of different aller-gens in turn, including shrimp allergen Pena1, soybean allergenb-conglycinin, and peanut allergen Arah1A.A model antigen–di- nitrophenol–bovine serum albumin was determined by applica-tion of the sensor in concentrations, ranging from 1 /C210 /C03to 10 ng/mL, at a detection limit of 3.3 /C210/C04ng/mL.The method was also successfully used for quantification of fish PV allergen with a detection limit of 0.16 ng/mL and a shrimp allergen Pen a with a detection limit at 0.03 lg/mL.
A miniaturized silicon-based sensor chip combined with an advanced microfluidic module for the simultaneous, label-freeimmunochemical determination of four allergens, bovine milkprotein, peanut protein, soy protein, and gliadin was applied(47). The sensor chip consists of an array of 10 broad-band Mach /C0Zehnder interferometers (BB-MZIs) integrated on silicon, along with their respective broad-band light sources.The BB-MZIs were biofunctionalized with the targeted allergens and their responses during immunoreaction were monitored by multiplexing their transmission spectra through an external miniaturized spectrometer.The analysis was performed by run-ning mixtures of calibrators or samples with the antibodiesagainst the four allergens followed by an antispecies specificantibodies solution.The detection limits obtained by applica-tion of the sensor were 0.04 lg/mL for bovine k-casein, 1.0 lg/mL for peanut protein, 0.80 lg/mL for soy protein, and 0.10 lg/mL for gliadin.
A magneto-chemical sensor was developed for on-site food allergen detection ( 48). A portable, point-of-use detection tech- nology, termed integrated exogenous antigen testing (iEAT) was applied.The system consists of a disposable antigen extraction device coupled with an electronic keychain reader for rapidsensing and communication.Figure 6A shows the portable iEAT system comprising a keychain reader, an extraction kit, and asmartphone app.Figure 6B presents the details of the iEAT reader, Figure 6C the correlation of results obtained by ELISA and iEAT.The prototype iEAT system was optimized to detectfive major food antigens in peanuts, hazelnuts, wheat, milk, and eggs.Using the magneto-chemical sensor, the following LOD values were obtained: 0.075 mg/kg for gliadin, 0.007 mg/kgfor Ara h1, 0.089 mg/kg for Cor a1, 0.170 mg/kg for casein and0.003 mg/kg for ovalbumin.
Molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles (nanoMIPs) a- casein detection using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) wassuccessfully applied for a milk allergen sensor ( 49). NanoMIPs with a high affinity toward bovine a-casein were synthesized using a solid-phase imprinting method.The nanoMIPs werethen characterized and incorporated into a label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based sensor.In the described method, the protein was attached to the glass beads via anamine coupling reaction.NanoMIPs were synthesized with asecondary monomer containing a primary amine group whichwere eluted with adequate yields and diameters.Molecularly-imprinted polymer nanoparticles in biosensors are thermallystable, exhibit comparable binding kinetics, can exist in a wide Figure 5.Schematic representation of the fabrication and assay procedure of the electrochemical mast cell-based paper sensor.Paper sheets were ﬁrstly patt erned in bulk using a wax printer.

Most sensors offer several advantages in terms of label-free detection, real-time measurements, and superior sensitivity compared to ELISA-based techniques. The application of func- tionalized magnetic microbeads in sensors allows the selectivedetermination of the allergen concentration directly in complex matrices, without complicated sample preparation steps.However, biosensors which use antibody-based receptors canexhibit problems in terms of their limited shelf-lives and instability to testing conditions.Detection of Allergens with Application of MS and MS/MS A number of immunochemical-based methods have been developed for allergen detection.Commonly used methods for allergen analysis are antibody-based assays, although some drawbacks are encountered such as matrix/processing effectsand epitope masking especially when dealing with productssuch as cookies, biscuits, and chocolate and other extensively processed foods.
These contain complex matrices usually con-taining e.g., fats, carbohydrates, proteins, minerals, and other compounds that are known to interact with one another and influence the properties of allergens. The disadvantages ofcurrent immunological methods for allergen analyses are nu- merous, hence alternatives have been investigated in recent years.In particular, nonimmunological methods have been in-vestigated and developed to overcome the drawbacks of ELISA (3).In the recent past, MS techniques have been successfully developed and applied for detection of allergens.An advantage of MS is that it confirms the presence of protein in investigated samples.
As far as MS-based allergen detection is concerned,two methodological options are currently available: detection of the intact protein representative of the allergenic ingredient which is usually the most abundant in the proteomic profile,and detection of the target analytes—namely markers that are signature peptides, properly selected, resulting from the enzymatic digestion of the whole allergenic component ( 50). MS-based procedures are limited by the application of mass analyzers and the size of the protein or charge state.The sensitivity and specificity of an ELISA can depend on the 3-D structure of allergens, whereas MS is based on the structur- ally independent amino acid sequence.Post-translational Figure 6.iEAT reader.(A) System schematic.This pocket-size reader is designed for standalone operation with its own display, rechargeable battery, and wir eless com- munication module.

Through the performance offered by the latest generation of mass analyzers, new efforts have been situated on the develop- ment of MS methods capable of delivering both qualitative andquantitative information about allergenic proteins. All mass spectrometers are composed of three different parts: ion source, mass analyzer, and detector.For the ion source, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)or electrospray ionization (ESI) are applied commonly.For themass analyzer, time-of-flight (TOF) and ion trap (IT) are most often applied in MS used for allergen detection ( 3).Different coupling with various mass analyzers are available suchas electrospray ionization-ion trap (ESI-IT), electrospray ionization-quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-qTOF), or MALDI-TOF.Quantitative triple quadrupole and IT systems have the advan-tage of identification and quantification through fragmentationsettings in the MS collision cell.
The parallel reaction monitor- ing (PRM) option available on quadrupole-orbitrap (Q-Orbitrap) MS equipment acquires a full MS/MS fragmentation spectrumfor a specific parent ion, providing the simultaneous monitoringof all the product ions at high accuracy and resolving power. The inherently high resolution of MS instruments combinedwith pairing of parent and fragment ion detection leads to the potential for high specificity ( 3).MS methods based on selection reaction monitoring (SRM) offer an alternative to ELISA and PCR for determination of aller-gens.Such methods have the multiplexing capacity required for a multiallergen screening tool and the potential to provide a rigorous, orthogonal reference method for allergen analysis.Before conducting MS analysis of allergens, allergen proteins are extracted from matrices and subsequently the digestion of the allergenic protein is most often performed.The conditions for the digestion process depend on the individual allergen structure.
Optimally, complete digestion should be achieved in a very short time with a maximum of peptides generated and without missed cleavage sites. One of the most efficient MS-based methods for allergen identification is based on electrophoresis separation (one- or two-dimensional) followed by western blotting detection usingsera from allergic patients, combined with an additional gel used for immune-reactive proteins characterization.Digestion of the allergenic protein is commonly performed prior to MS analysis following the bottom-up strategy.Digestion cleaves large proteins onto smaller peptides, and thus potential matrixinterferences and associated interactions with other proteins are reduced.These reductions remove complicating factors and make the analysis with LC /C0MS more reproducible.Optimally, a complete digestion is performed in a very short time with a maximum of peptides generated and without missed cleavagesites.
The peptides generated should be stable and easily detected by MS ( 3). In the next step of experiments, allergens are determined by MS, MS/MS, or chromatographic techniques coupled with MS or MS/MS.MS/MS analysis (e.g., MALDI-TOF/ Figure 7.(A) SPR sensorgram showing the immobilization of casein nanoMIPs and the control nanoMIP on the sensor surface.atomic force microscope (AFM) of (B) bare gold, (C) Self-assembled monolayers (SAM) monolayer, and (D) covalently attached nanoMIPs ( 49).Reprinted with permission from Ashley, J., Shukor, Y., D’Aurelio, R., Trinh, L., Rodgers, T.L.Temblay, J., Pleasants, M., Tothill, I.E.(2018) ACS Sens .3, 418–424.Copyright American Chemical Society.Tuzimski and Petruczynik: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol.103, No.4, 2020 |1009 TOF or ESI-MS/MS) determines structural information related to the sequence of peptides, rather than only their mass, making the search highly specific ( 3).
For analysis of allergens from sunflower ( Helianthus annuus L.), spots from 2-D gel electrophoresis (2-DE) corresponding tothe IgE reactive spots on a 2 D blot, were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion for sample preparation ( 51). After ap- propriate extraction procedure including gel trypsin digestion ofspots from 2 D gel corresponding to the IgE reactive spots on 2 Dblot samples were analysed by MALDI-TOF/TOF in positive ion mode ( 51).MS/MS spectra were acquired with a minimum of 4000 and a maximum of 8000 laser shots applied through the in-strument calibration file.MALDI-TOF/TOF operated in positiveion mode was also applied for identification of allergens from Curvularia pallescens (52).In the procedure, before MS detection allergen proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and 2D-PAGE.Following that, corresponding immunoblots were performed todetect IgE reaction.
Triosephosphate isomerase as an allergen in Octopus fangsiao was separated from matrix by SDS-PAGE or by 2-DE ( 53). After separation and purification the allergen was determined byMALDI TOF-MS ( 53).MS methods based on selection reaction monitoring offer an alternative to ELISA and PCR for allergen analysis.The advan- tages of MS are ease of sample preparation, rapid analysis, andthe ability to analyze many allergens simultaneously.An im-portant advantage in analysis of peptides by MS is the excellent predictability of peptide fragmentation depending on the applied fragmentation mechanism.MS-based methods havethe multiplexing capacity required for a multi-allergen screen-ing tool and the potential to provide a rigorous, orthogonal ref- erence method for allergen determination.Regarding accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity, mass spectrometry-based strategiesbring important advantage over immunological and nucleicacid-based methods.
MS is especially appropriate for allergen analysis in complex samples such as food matrices. The major- ity of published targeted MS-based allergen detection methodsuse QqQ instrumentation and make use of multiple-reactionmonitoring (MRM) experiments for specific peptide identifica- tion and quantitation ( 54).Recent developments of new high-resolution instruments have enabled advancement in MS-based methods for allergenanalysis.MALDI-TOF-MS has been used in numerous proce- dures for the determination of food allergens, generally after one- or two-dimensional separation of proteins by gel electro-phoresis.To enhance sensitivity and specificity, triple-stage MS(MS 3)has been developed.This method is, in principle, available on QTrap instruments in which the third quadrupole necessary for the detection of fragment ions is exchanged for aquadrupole linear ion trap (LIT) ( 54).This allows for the accumu- lation and secondary fragmentation of ions in the linear trap.
Accumulation of fragment ions in the LIT results in increased sensitivity, whereas the possibility of a secondary fragmenta-tion experiment increases the specificity of the method ( 54). In the procedure, intact proteins were analyzed on a Q-TOF instru- ment, and sequence data were obtained after chymotryptic di- gestion in a bottom-up proteomics experiment.Obtainedresults were applied for allergen monitoring in food samples.Asignificant increase in sensitivity of multiple reaction monitor- ing cubed (MRM 3) compared to MRM was observed ( 55).MS com- bined with appropriate sample preparation, liquid or gaschromatography and/or different electrophoretic methodsbrings an additional strategic advance.However, the MS analy- sis of allergen proteins requires a step of protein digestion togenerate peptides for their detection by MS.The development of MS for allergen analysis should take into consideration theproperties of the individual proteins and kind of matrices.
Chromatographic Methods Coupled with Different Detection Techniques In chromatography the components in the investigated mixture are separated based on their relative affinity to the two phases.Molecules having a greater affinity to the stationary phasetravel slower than the ones with lesser affinity. The separated molecules are then compared to known standards and identified.Chromatographic techniques especially coupled withMS or MS/MS detection are increasingly applied for allergenanalysis.Thin layer chromatography (TLC) TLC is rarely applied for analysis of allergens.In TLC, different solvent systems and various stationary phases in a large rangeof polarity can be applied.
Proteins in milk were separated byTLC on HPTLC silica gel plates with mobile phase containing2-butanol–pyridine /C0ammonia–ddH 2O (39:20:10:31; v/v/v/v), cel- lulose plates with the same mixture consisting of 2-butanol– pyridine–ammonia–ddH 2O (32:30:11:25; v/v/v/v), C18 plates mix- ture of acetonitrile–TFA– ddH 2O (50:3.75:46.25; v/v/v) ( 56). For protein/peptide specific derivatization, ninhydrin was used oncellulose stationary phase, while on reversed-phase (RP) and sil- ica gel plates fluorescamine was applied.As an extension to an all-encompassing protein staining, a specific detection of singleproteins using antibodies was developed.The first antibodypossesses affinity towards the target protein and was appliedfollowing the initial blocking step.The secondary antibody was labeled with an enzyme (HRP) that exerts a reaction on the chro- mogenic substrate and therefore visualizes the first bound anti-body.
Following the chromatographic separation andevaporation of the mobile phase, the HPTLC plate was trans-ferred into a small vessel. In order to inhibit unspecific binding of the antibodies to the surface, the plate was initially incubated with Tween20 as blocking reagent, containing Tween20, sodiumchloride, and tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane.After incu-bation the plates with blocking solution (twices for 15 min),blocking solution was removed and replaced by the primary an- tibody solution in Tris buffer.The plate was incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies and washed with buffer.Coating withthe secondary antibody was performed for 1 h and washing.Prior to detection, the pH value was lowered by incubation ofthe plate for 1 min in a solution consisting of tris-HCl (pH 6.0).
Finally, the detection was performed by incubating the plate in a dying solution containing 3,3 0,5,50-tetramethylbenzi- dine, dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt, citric acid monohy-drate, sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, ethanol, anddihydrogen dioxide. The conducted incubation using the detec- tion medium was carried out until blue bands appeared on a white background.Subsequently, the analytes were detected inwhite light and documented using a photodocumentation sys-tem.The procedure of HPTLC separation with the immunologi-cal detection of antigens was applied for analysis of allergens in real food samples (a commercially available milk powder and a wine-fining agent based on milk) ( 56).HPLC and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) HPLC coupled with MS (LC-MS) and especially MS/MS (LC-MS/ MS), have the ability to determine the protein sequence level.1010 | Tuzimski and Petruczynik: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol.103, No.
4, 2020 Chromatographic methods coupled with MS/MS are also able to provide relative or absolute quantitative data, which is particu- larly valuable in allergen protein analysis. The multiplexing ca- pability of the method is especially attractive for multi-allergendetection given the increased complexity and diversity ofcomplex matrices.Many reports on LC-MS and LC-MS/MS aller- gen analysis methods for individual food allergens have been published for the analysis of egg, milk, walnuts, peanut, andtree nut and various allergens in different matrices ( 57–59).RP system on octadecyl (C18) stationary phase for analysis of allergens RP SYSTEM CONTAINING ORGANIC MODIFIERS ,WATER ,AND FORMIC OR TRIFLUOROACETIC ACID .Most often acetonitrile or definitely less often methanol were applied as organic modifiers in RP systemfor analysis of allergens.
The addition of a small amount of for-mic or acetic acid, or less rarely trifluoroacetic acid as compo- nents of mobile phase supports the ionization of ESI in positive mode (most often used in the procedures for allergen analysis)due to increased tendency to protonate analytes. Daly et al.analyzed almond and peanut allergens in raw commodity as well as in processed products, such as chocolate, biscuits, snacks, and crackers, by LC- MS/MS on a peptide column with mobile phase containing acetonitrile, water, andformic acid ( 11).For separation of proteins, gradient elution was applied.For detection, a Q-Orbitrap mass spectrometer with a turbo spray ESI source operated in positive ionization mode was used.The LODs obtained by the procedure for almond peptides(GNLDFVQPPR and ALPDEVLANAYQISR) was 0.15 ppm.Forpeanut peptide GTGNLELVAVR, the LOD was 0.05 ppm andfor peanut peptide RPFYSNAPQEIFIQQGR the LOD was 0.5 ppm.
LOQ for almond peptides (GNLDFVQPPR and ALPDEVLANAYQISR)was 0.5 ppm, for peanut peptide GTGNLELVAVR 0.15 ppm, andfor peanut peptide RPFYSNAPQEIFIQQGR 1.0 ppm ( 11). UPLC-MS/MS was applied for quantification of allergens from roasted walnuts ( 57).A UPLC system was connected with Orbitrap MS for detection of analytes.Additionally, the methodwas applied to confirm the presence of Maillard-type adducts on the walnut allergens ( 57).The LC-MS/MS data analysis incor- porated label-free quantification of relevant allergens andMaillard adduct screening.The MS analysis results presented inthis study revealed information about the molecular-level effects of roasting on walnut allergens.The authors also concluded that the LC-MS/MS detection and quantification ofallergens from roasted walnuts was affected differentiallydepending on the individual allergen in question, the degree of heat treatment, and the sample preparation method ( 57).
Milk protein allergens from processed food were determined by LC-MS/MS on a ProtID-Chip-150 column ( 58). For LC-MS/MS analysis Q-TOF mass spectrometer and for targeted analytes.LC-MS/MS quantification a triple quadrupole mass spectrome- ter were applied in the method.Additionally, authors described a method for the extraction of food allergen proteins from solidmatrices based on proteolytic digestion.The performance of themethod was compared with the performance of methods reported in the literature.( 58).Boo et al.simultaneously detected and quantified allergens of egg, milk, and peanuts insugar cookies by UPLC-MS/MS ( 59).In the described investiga- tions, extraction, concentration, and digestion of samples for candidate peptide markers were optimized.In the procedure, a linear gradient was applied for peptides separation.MRM-MSanalysis was conducted using a Q-Orbitrap mass spectrometeroperates in positive-ion mode.
The UPLC-MS/MS MRM method was used for the monitoring of 102 peptide transitions ( 59).Sometimes automated systems for sample preparation and chromatographic separation are applied for determination of allergens. Allergens in egg, skimmed milk, soy flour, ground ha- zelnut, and ground peanut in cookies were determined by LC-MS/MS ( 60).The sample preparation procedure was based on ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction followed by rapid size- exclusion chromatography.After enzymatic tryptic digestion by trypsin solution, peptides were transferred to on-line couplingof solid phase extraction (SPE) with a RP-HPLC system.Peptideswere purified on SPE C18 cartridges and separated on a C18 ana- lytical column with mobile phase containing acetonitrile, water, and formic acid.For detection, ESI interface connected to a dualpressure linear IT-MS was applied.The application of an on-lineSPE resulted in higher sensitivity of the SRM detection ( 60).
LODs obtained by the extraction, separation, and detection pro- cedure were from 6 to 13 mg/g, LOQs from 19 to 40 mg/g. LC–ESI þ-MS/MS was also applied for determination of peanut and tree nut allergen peptides ( 61).Allergen proteins from samples were extracted using TRIS and HCl (pH 7.5) and separated on an Agilent Poroshell 120 column with mobilephase containing acetonitrile, water, and trifluoroacetic acid.The described proteomic approach uses LC–MS/MS to specifi- cally detect 12 tree nut allergens and peanut in one analysis.This multiplexed approach allows for accuracy and sensitivityin the testing of food for hidden allergenic compounds to satisfyboth inspection and labelling purposes.Figure 8 shows a repre- sentative extracted ion current chromatogram for 3 peanut marker peptides in several foods that contain peanuts and incorn, which did not contain peanuts, illustrating the specificitythat can be achieved with LC-ESI þ-MS/MS ( 61).
One of the current trends of advanced analytical chemistry is the miniaturization of analytical instruments. A micro HPLC system often leads to increased separation speed, reduced sam-ple and reagent consumption, and a lower instrument costcompared to that of a traditional system.Additionally, there is an increasing demand for sensitive and high throughput MS- based methods for screening especially tailored to the detectionof allergen contaminants in different food commodities.A chal-lenging issue is represented by complex food matrices where commercial antibody-based kits might encounter objective lim- itations due to the masking of epitopes caused by the interfer-ence of compounds arising from the matrix.A performance of amethod duly optimized for the extraction and simultaneous de- tection of soy, egg, and milk allergens in a cookie food matrix by micro HPLC–ESI-MS/MS, was reported by Monaci et al ( 62).
The extraction procedures and different instrumental parameterswere optimized in the investigations in order to obtain optimal conditions for analysis of these allergens. Based on the optimi- zation, allergens from food samples were extracted with Tris–HCl buffer at pH ¼8.2 and purified on a size exclusion column before protein enzymatic digestion was performed.For separa- tion of peptides, a micro C18 column and mobile phase consist- ing acetonitrile, water, and formic acid was applied.Dual celllinear IT-MS/MS was used for detection of analytes.The use ofdual cell linear IT-MS/MS allowed for determination of the most intense and reliable peptide markers in investigated food sam- ples.A total of eleven peptides were monitored for confirmationpurposes of each allergenic contaminant and the two most sen-sitive peptide markers/proteins were selected in order to per- form quantitative determination ( 62).
LODs obtained by the procedure were in range from 0.1 mg/g for milk,0.3 mg/g for egg, and 2 mg/g for soy. HPLC-ESI þ-MS/MS using a Qtrap was also applied for analy- sis of egg white, skim milk, peanut, soy, and tree nuts (almond,Tuzimski and Petruczynik: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol.103, No.4, 2020 |1011 Brazil nut, cashew, hazelnut, pecan, pine nut, pistachio, and walnut) allergens ( 63).Before analysis, food samples were defat- ted and proteins were extracted with buffer containing urea,Trizma base, and octyl b-D-glucopyranoside.After extraction,reduction by tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, al- kylation by S-methyl methanethiosulfonate, and protein diges- tion by trypsin at 37 /C14C were performed.
The authors carried out peptide-mapping experiments to identify unique and selectivepeptides that could be used as signature markers of allergens.For this purpose, the tryptic digests of the allergen commodities were separated on a C18 column using mobile phase containingacetonitrile, water, and formic acid. A triple TOF mas spectrom- eter operated in positive ESI mode was applied for detection ofanalytes.For the quantitative analysis of allergenic peptidesQTRAP MS was used.Data processing were performed using theMQ4 algorithm in MultiQuant v3.0.2 software.The LOD value obtained by the analytical procedure was 10 ppm ( 63).Next, a targeted MRM method was optimized and applied to screenmarker peptides in food samples.Gomaa et al.compared the performance of the flow cytome- try method developed with LC–MS and ELISA for detection of allergens in food matrices containing either single or multiple Figure 8.

Recoveries were poor for the baked cookies (67–90%, 66–95%,and 66–88% for casein, soy protein, and gluten, respectively).The multiplex flow cytometry assay allows for multiple allergen detection in the raw samples, with the following recoveries based on soluble protein: casein, 95–107%; soy protein, 92–97%,and gluten, 96–99%. Recoveries for the baked cookies were asfollows: casein, 84–90%; soy protein, 80–88%, and gluten, 80–90%.Allergen proteins were separated on a C18 column with mobile phase containing acetonitrile with trifluoroacetic acidand water with formic acid.Linear gradient elution was per-formed by increasing the mobile-phase composition from 3% to 40% of acetonitrile with trifluoroacetic acid over 45 min.Analytes were detected by a tandem Q-TOF mass spectrometeroperated in positive ion mode.
The application of a LC–MS tech-nique led to detection of peptide markers that could be used to identify allergens in the baked food samples up to concentra- tions of 10 ppm for casein and soy protein, and 100 ppm for glu-ten ( 34). The mustard allergen Sin a 1 in food was determined by a LC-MS/MS-SRM-based method ( 64,65).A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode was applied for detection of investigated peptides.Samples of cashew nutwere analyzed using LC-MS, SDS-PAGE, and immunoassaymethods ( 16).The mass spectrum was simultaneously acquired using positive and negative ESI modes ( 16).Soybean allergens (Glycine max) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS after separationby 2-DE and extraction ( 24).Soybean proteins were initially separated by 2-DE.Next, proteins from identical gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immu- noblots.
Bound IgE was detected using monoclonal anti-humanIgE, then washed to remove unbound detection antibodies.Bound anti-IgE was detected with chemiluminescent substrate. After trypsin digestion allergen peptides were analyzed by LC- MS/MS.Separation was performed on a C18 column with mobilephase containing acetonitrile, water, and formic acid.Q-TOF-MS with an ESI source was applied for detection of analytes.In another paper, a high-resolution qTOF mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (LC-ESIqTOF) was applied for determina-tion of sunflower allergens ( 51).Allergen proteins from large yellow croaker ( Larimichthys crocea )(66),Glycyrrhiza uralensis (64), and hazelnut allergens ( 67), initially separated by SDS-PAGE, were analyzed on a C18 column with mobile phase containingacetonitrile, water, and formic acid and detected by MS/MS.In a similar RP system, allergen tryptic peptides from egg were analyzed by LC-MS/MS after preliminary detection by ELISA ( 27).
In the method, in order to successfully fitting immu- noassay to LC-MS analysis, authors applied AASIA-ELISA, inwhich target amino acid sequence of the analyte is conformed to LC-MS/MS detection peptide. After separation by HPLC, the tryptic peptides were identified by a triple quadrupole MS forpeptide quantification or by a TOF-MS for peptide identification(27).Birch pollen allergens were analyzed by UPLC-MS ( 65).Chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 UPLC column with a mixture of acetonitrile, water, and formic acid aseluent.Detection of allergen peptides were carried out on atriple quadrupole mass spectrometer in MRM mode using positive ion ESI ( 65).In another paper ( 12), a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in positive ionization mode was coupled to a HPLC in-strument for detection and quantification of egg, milk, and pea- nut in thermally processed bakery products (cereal bars andmuffins).Data acquisition was performed in scheduled MRM mode.
The comparison of the performance of commercial im- munochemical assays with that of a multi-allergen MS method for the detection and quantitation of investigated allergens wasalso described ( 12). Detection of allergen Glb33 in rice was performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in ESI positive ion mode after separation on a C18 column with mobile phase con-taining acetonitrile, water, and formic acid.The MS/MS datawere collected in MRM mode Three mass transitions (precursor/ fragment ion pairs) were selected for each peptide for quantita- tion and confirmation.Before LC-MS/MS analysis an enzymaticdigestion of samples was performed after salt solution extrac-tion of samples.A signature peptide from the tryptic digest was selected to represent the target protein, and an isotope-labeled signature peptide from the tryptic digest of the internalstandard peptide was employed as the actual internal standardduring MS analysis ( 68).
Soybean peptides were separated on a RP column using a 30 min gradient of 5% to 60% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% for- mic acid ( 69). MALDI-TOF-MS was applied for analyte detection.Before proper analysis, protein digestion was performed withmodified porcine trypsin in ammonium bicarbonate buffer.After SDS-PAGE and trypsin digestion, olive pollen allergens were analyzed by LC-MS/MS ( 2).For comprehensive proteomics analysis, the authors applied the wild olive genomics data ( 2).Before LC-MS/MS analysis, the proteins were suspended in buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM phenylmethane-sulfonyl fluoride with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail.After centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by SDS- PAGE.Proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G 250.
Next, whole lanes were cutinto four slices and in-gel trypsin digestion was performed.Then, excised bands were cut into small pieces and were sepa- rately treated with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 50% acetonitrile, Next, the bands were dehydrated with acetonitrile,and dried. Samples were then reduced with 10 mM dithiothrei-tol in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and alkylated with iodoa- cetamide to a final concentration of 50 mM.The gel pieces were then dried, rehydrated with 12.5 ng/mL of trypsin in 50 mM am-monium bicarbonate, and incubated at 37 /C14C.Next, peptides were extracted using 100% acetonitrile and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, purified using a Zip Tip with 0.6 lL of C18 resin, and dried.Obtained samples were reconstituted in 5 lL of 0.1% formic acid in 2% acetonitrile and analyzed by LC /C0MS/MS.Analytes were separated on a C18 column with the application of a gradient elution.The mobile phase contained acetonitrile, water, and 0.1% of formic acid.
Hybrid Q-Orbitrap MS was used for allergenpeptides detection in the procedure ( 2). Multiplex food allergen (almond, brazil nut, cashew, hazel- nut, pistachio, walnut, egg, lupin, milk, mustard, peanut, ses- ame, soy, and wheat) detection was performed by LC /C0MS/MS (70).Allergens were separated on a C18 column with mobile phase containing acetonitrile, water, and trifluoroacetic acid.Detection was performed on a triple quadrupole mass spec- trometer.Authors also described a computational approach foraddressing heterogeneous interference derived from diversefood matrices.Authors highlighted how a single multiplexed scheduled MRM method can overcome complex matrix interfer- ence and capture trends in allergen contamination ( 70).To improve the sensitivity of LC-MS methods, nanoflow sep- aration whereby the narrow diameter of the analytical channel from which the sample enters the ion source produces a smallerTuzimski and Petruczynik: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol.103, No.
4, 2020 |1013 electrospray plume, can be applied. Conventional or microflui- dic chromatographic separation with MS detection was appliedfor quantification of peanut allergens in a complex food matrix(71).In the procedure for sample preparation reduction was performed by addition of dithiothreitol, alkylation by applica- tion of iodoacetamide.Next, samples were digested by trypsin for 3h at 37 and were extracted by a simple buffer extractionwith an acid-labile detergent.A C18 column and mobile phasecontaining acetonitrile, water, and formic acid were applied forseparation of allergenic peptides.For detection of analytes, atriple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in positive ionMRM mode was coupled to a HPLC system.Microfluidic separa- tion provided greater sensitivity and increased ionization efficiency at low levels of allergenic peptide concentrations ( 71).
Next, 2DE-IgE immunoblotting allergens of house dust mite(Dermatophagoides farinae) were chromatographed on an Acclaim PepMap column ( 72). A MicroToF-Q-MS with ESI was used for detection of allergen proteins.Various undeclared food allergens in cumin were deter- mined by UPLC-MS/MS ( 10).Peanut allergen proteins (Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3, Ara h 6, Ara h 7, and Ara h 8) in cumin sampleswere separated on a C18 UPLC capillary column using mobilephase containing acetonitrile, water, and 0.1% of formic acid.For detection of analytes, a Hybrid Ion Trap-Orbitrap mass spec- trometer was coupled to a UPLC system.Almond and hazelnut allergens from roasted nuts were also determined by LC-MS/MS.Separation of allergen proteins wasperformed on a C18 column with mobile phase containingacetonitrile, water, and formic acid.
Detection of allergens wasperformed on Q-Orbitrap-based MS systems operated in iposi-tive ionisation mode or on a Q-Orbitrap mass spectrometer op-erated in positive ionization mode. All measurements wereperformed using a scheduled MRM method with two transitions per selected peptide ( 20).Analysis of gluten in processed foodstuffs by a multi- allergens and grain-specific UHPLC-MS/MS method has also been described ( 69).Before analysis, samples were ultrasoni- cated and centrifuged and the proteins were subsequently re-duced with DL-dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide,and enzymatically digested with trypsin.Peptide solutions werepurified using C18 SPE columns.Analytes were separated on aC18 column with mobile phase containing acetonitrile, water,and formic acid.Detection was performed using a triple quadru- pole mass spectrometer operated in positive ionization mode.The chromatographic method with MS/MS detection wascompared to ELISA.
The semiquantitative multi-allergen andgrain-specific UHPLC-MS/MS method turned out to be comple-mentary to ELISA kits ( 35). Allergen peptides from hazelnut, cashew, almond, peanut, and walnut were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.A triple quadrupolemass spectrometer operated in positive ion electrospray modewas used for detection of analytes in various food samples.Inthe method, for sample preparation, urease to hydrolyze theurea in the extraction buffer was apllied.Therefore, no further cleanup of the extract before injecting was required.Before LC- MS/MS analysis in silico digestion with the enzyme trypsin wasperformed ( 73).LC-MS/MS was also applied for determination of fish aller- gens ( 74).Allergens were separated on a C18 column with mobile phase containing acetonitrile, water, and formic acid.After separation analytes were detected on a qTOF massspectrometer.ORGANIC MODIFIER (ACETONITRILE OR METHANOL )-WATER (RP)SYSTEM .Quantitative analysis of nut allergens was performed by LC-MS/ MS.
Detection was performed by a ESI mass spectrometer oper- ated in positive ionization mode. The important parametersinfluencing the quantitative analysis of food allergens via LC-MS (food matrix, sample history, and sample preparation) were investigated ( 75).Mobile phases containing only organic modifier and water were used much less frequently for the analysis of allergens.Before LC-MS/MS analysis the proteins of eggplant peel ex- tract were separated on a phenyl-sepharose column andanalyzed by skin prick test, ELISA, and IgE-immunoblotting.The components were analyzed for polyphenol oxidase activity, presence of protein–bound copper, and recognition by rabbitpolyclonal anti-sweet potato polyphenol oxidase antiserum (76).In the next step of experiment, LC–MS/MS and in silico analysis were employed to identify the separated allergens andprediction of IgE epitopes.
Eggplant allergens were separated into five components (PS1–PS5), of which component PS2 exhib- ited high specific Polyphenol Oxidase (PPO) activity ( 76). In rare cases, HPLC-DAD has been applied for determination of allergens.Using this method, allergens are determined by comparison of retention times and UV-Vis spectra.HPLC-DAD was applied for analysis of hydroxycitronellal, coumarin, lyral,eugenol, citronellol, farnesol, and eighteen potentially aller- genic substances in cosmetics.For sample preparation, an ultrasound-assisted emulsification microextraction techniquewas used, followed by solidification of the floating organic drop.Analytes were separated on a octadecyl (C18) stationary pahse with mobile phase containing acetonitrile and water..Detectionwas performed by DAD coupled to a HPLC instrument.LODs obtained by the described procedure were from 0.013 mg/mL for citral to 6 mg/mL for hydroxycitronellal.
HPLC–DAD chromato- gram obtained at 200 nm for a standard mixture of the 24 poten- tially allergenic substances and UV–Vis spectra of the analytes are presented in Figure 9 (77). HPLC coupled with a variable-wavelength UV-Vis detector is sometimes applied for analysis of allergens.For example, prot- amines from different types of fish and target proteins were an- alyzed by HPLC-UV-Vis ( 23).Chromatography was performed to analyze the types of phenylthiohydantoin amino acids to obtain the protamine N-terminal sequence information.Separation was carried out on a octadecyl (C18) stationary phase with mo-bile phase containing acetonitrile and water.Allergen proteins were detected by a UV-Vis detector at k¼220 nm.Korte et al.developed a MS approach for the detection of contamination with shrimp and lobster, two economically im- portant types of crustaceans, in complex food matrices.
Lobster and shrimp allergens in food samples were analyzed by LC cou-pled high-resolution MS/MS (LC /C0HRMS/MS) ( 55). Detection was carried out by a triple TOF spectrometer operating in positive MRM and MRM 3modes.The MS/MS scan was performed with high-sensitivity settings on the 25 most intense ions of each cy-cle with an accumulation time of 100 ms.A total of 2036 cycles were performed, thus an average of 11 cycles per chromato- graphic peak ( 55).Maize allergens were separated by HPLC and detected by the application of Orbitrap MS ( 78).For sample preparation, protein was dissolved in a chaotrope-containing buffer (8 M urea, 50 mMTris-HCl, pH 8.0) followed by quantification using the Bradford assay used to measure the concentration of total protein in a sample.Protein was portioned and spiked with AQUA peptidesand reduced by adding dithiothreitol to 10 mM and incubated for 1 h at RT.
Alkylation was performed by adding1014 | Tuzimski and Petruczynik: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol. 103, No.4, 2020 iodoacetamide and incubated for 1 h.Urea was neutralized by adding a solution containing 10 mM ammonium bicarbonateand dithiothreitol.Trypsin was added to sample protein at a1:49 ratio and digestion proceeded for 18 h at 37 /C14C.After diges- tion, samples were frozen at /C080/C14C and evaporated to dryness.Dried protein digests were dissolved immediately prior to MS analysis to a concentration of 0.40 lg/lL with 5% (v/v) acetoni- trile, 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in water.HPLC separation of analyteswas performed using in-house fused silica nanospray needles,10.5 cm length, (360 lm outer diameter, 150 lm inner diameter), that were packed with a C18 sorbent.Mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water ( 78).
Food allergens in milk, eggs, cod, shrimp, lobster, almonds, brazil nuts, cashew nuts, hazelnuts, walnuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans were separated on a C18 column with mobile phase containing acetonitrile and water ( 79). Detection was per- formed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.Allergenswere monitored by single reaction monitoring in positive ESImode ( 79).OTHER MOBILE AND STATIONARY PHASES .Mobile phases of a different composition than those discussed so far have also been infre-quently used to analyze allergens.Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) is a liquid chromatography technique that uses a polar stationary phase— silica or a polar bonded phases in conjunction with a mobile phase containing a small amount of water combined with ahigher proportion of a less polar solvent (often acetonitrile).HILIC is often applied for the separation of very polar analytes.An important feature of HILIC is the improved sensitivity with electrospray MS.
HILIC has been infrequently used for the sepa- ration of allergens. For example, analysis of N-glycoforms ofsoybean allergenic glycoproteins previously separated by SDS-PAGE was performed by LC-MS/MS on an amide HILIC column with mobile phase containing acetonitrile and aqueous ammo- nium solution.Analytes were detected by linear IT-ESI-MS/MS.The method allows the separation of N-glycan isomers andobtaining information on the quantitative distribution of differ-ent types of N-glycans for each soy protein sample.Figure 9.In black: HPLC–DAD chromatogram at 200 nm of a standard mixture of the 24 regulated potentially allergenic substances (PAS).Concentration level was 0.8mg/mL for all the analytes except forhydroxycitronellal (136 mg/mL), lyral (8.37 mg/mL), and farnesol (1.98 mg/mL).

Monosaccharides were separated on a C18 column with mobile phase containing acetonitrile, tetra-hydrofuran, water, phosphoric acid, and n-butylamine.Analytes were detected by MALDI-TOF-MS.1-Phenyl-3-methyl- 5-pyrazolone was analyzed on a C18 UPLC column with a mix- ture of acetonitrile, water, and ammonium acetate.Detection inthe procedure was performed by DAD.HILIC-UPLC analysis wasalso performed for N-glycan profiling and quantification.Separation was carried out on an ethylene-bridged hybrid (BEH)UPLC column.A mixture of acetonitrile, water, and ammoniumacetate was used as mobile phase ( 80).Plant N-glycans were separated by UPLC using an Acquity BEH Glycan column and mobile phase containing acetonitrile, water,and ammonium formate ( 81).
Eluate fractions were manually collected to isolate the main N-glycan peak observed in the chro-matogram. After solvent evaporation using vacuum centrifuga- tion, samples were analyzed by MALDI/TOF-MS.Before UPLC-MS/ MS analysis, samples of blended plant foodstuff were centrifugedto remove insoluble material.Glycoprotein pellets were obtainedafter precipitation of cleared supernatant with aqueous trichloro-acetic acid solution and centrifugation and directly used forbacterial protein N-glycanase treatment.Samples were mixedwith a labeling reagent and incubated for 2 h at 65 /C14C.Prior to UPLC analysis, acetonitrile was added to the samples ( 81).LC-MS has several proven advantages, including sensitivity, specificity, and the ability to detect a broad range of allergenconcentrations that may span four or five orders of magnitude.LC-MS/MS has the desirable capability to function at the proteinsequence level.
Depending on the approach, LC-MS/MS has the potential to estimate changes in individual proteins or individ- ual amino acids in a protein sequence. Despite these advantages, the application of LC-MS to aller- gen analysis has some limitations such as: a lack of repositories of protein sequences for allergenic foods, especially those ofplant origin, available genome sequences may not be in aformat suitable for protein identification, and species-specificpeptide markers need identification ( 1).Additionally, the sepa- ration of intact proteins from complex samples using LC is stillextremely challenging.Generally, the LC-MS/MS detection andquantification of allergens differentiate significantly dependingon the individual type of allergen, the degree of heat treatment, and the sample preparation method.Examples of chromatographic and MS conditions are pre- sented in Table 2 .
GC and multidimensional or coupled techniques (GC-GC, GC 3GC, 2-D) Allergens, especially those found in cosmetics, have been ana- lyzed by GC methods usually coupled with MS or MS/MS. OftenGC-GC-MS has been applied for analysis of allergens.A typicalGC-GC-MS configuration consists of a monitoring flame ioniza- tion detector (FID) to detect the effluent of the first dimension column, while only the second dimension column is connectedto the mass spectrometer.Comprehensive two-dimensional (2-D) gas chromatography coupled with MS (GC-MS) or tandemmass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) is a effective technique foranalysis of multicomponent mixtures of volatiles.Rey et al.developed a GC-GC-FID-MS method for analysis of 56 (69 analytes including isomers) suspected chemically definedfragrance allergens in perfumes ( 83).Samples were not pre- pared before GC-GC-FID-MS analysis.The first dimension sepa-ration was carried out on a VF1-MS capillary column.
Thesecond dimension separation was performed on an LTM DB17- MS capillary column. The optimized condition was successfully applied for quantification of the target allergens in complex per- fume matrices.The authors applied the combination of multi- ple heart-cut chromatography with a low thermal mass chromatography module applied to quantification of allergens.The low thermal mass chromatography produces independent and fast temperature gradients in the second dimension.Analytes were detected by quadrupole FID-MS.A 2-D GC coupled with quadrupole MS (GC /C2GC-qMS) method was developed for the determination of 54 fragrance allergens in cosmetics ( 84).In the first dimension, SLB-5ms [sil- phenylene polymer virtually equivalent in polarity to poly(5%di- phenyl/95% methyl siloxane)], in the second dimension SLB-35 [equivalent in polarity to poly(35% diphenyl/65% methyl silox-ane)] columns were used.
Quantification of allergens was per- formed by using extracted ions; target analyte identification was performed through measurement of ion ratios (qualifier/ quantifier), full-scan MS database matching and the use of lin- ear retention indices. The calculated LODs and LOQs obtained by the proposed procedure were in the ranges from 0.04 (meth- ylsalicylate) to 0.30 mg/L (caryophyllene oxide, two farnesol isomers), and from 0.14 (methyl salicylate) to 1.00 mg/L (caryophyllene oxide, two farnesol isomers), respectively.Theflow-modulation (FM) GC /C2GC–qMS chromatogram obtained for the allergen solution is shown in Figure 10 .Full evaporation dynamic headspace in combination with selectable one-dimensional (1-D) or 2-D gas chromatography coupled with MS was applied for the determination of sus-pected fragrance allergens in cosmetic products—shower gels or body creams ( 85).In the proposed method an alternative ap- proach based on full evaporation dynamic headspace sampling was applied.
For separation of allergens, a polar DB-Wax capil- lary column was applied in the first dimension and an apolar Rtx-5 (5/% phenyl methyl siloxane) capillary column was se- lected in the second dimension. The main advantage of the pro- cedure is the non-discriminating injection of solutes covering a relatively large boiling point range, while non-volatile materialsuch as salts and detergents are not recovered.Fragrance allergens were analyzed by GC /C22GC-MS/FID with a dual-parallel secondary column and dual detection ( 86).The applied chromatographic system was equipped with a reverse- inject differential flow modulator consisting of one capillaryflow technology plate connected to a three-way solenoid valve that receives a controlled supply of carrier gas (helium) from an auxiliary electronic pressure control module.
In the first dimen- sion, a polar (DB-Wax) capillary column was applied, and in the second dimension two parallel columns (OV-1701 and deacti- vated fused silica) were used. Analysis of different personal care products to simultaneous determination of different families of personal care products including fragrance allergens, synthetic musks, phthalates, anti- oxidants, and UV filters in continental water, was also performed by GC-MS/MS ( 87).Before GC analysis, samples were prepared by solid-phase microextraction on poly-dimethylsiloxane/ divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) fiber.GC separation was carried out on a Zebron ZB-Semivolatiles column with helium as the carriergas.A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in positive ionization mode was coupled to a GC instrument for detection of allergens.LODs obtained by the procedure were from 0.023 ng/Lto 14 ng/L, and LOQs ranged between 0.078 ng/Lto 46 ng/L.
The obtained chromatogram for a sample containing 19 of the target analytes is presented in Figure 11 .1016 | Tuzimski and Petruczynik: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol. 103, No.4, 2020 Eighteen cosmetic products of different formulation, includ- ing creams, lotions, and gels were analyzed for the presence of undeclared allergenic fragrance ingredients by GC-MS ( 88).Separation was performed on a VF-5 ms column, detection on a single quadrupole MS detector.Authors proposed that a simple liquid extraction was developed for sample preparation before head space GC-MS method.The procedure was applied forsimultaneous analysis of twenty four volatile allergenic fragran- ces in complex cosmetic formulations, such as hydrophilic andlipophilic creams, lotions and gels.Application of electrophoresis to allergen analysis SDS-PAGE.Gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting rep- resents the standard procedure for allergen separation andTable 2.

103, No. 4, 2020 |1017 identification.SDS-PAGE is the most commonly used method to fractionate allergen proteins according to their molecular weight.The SDS denatures and coats the proteins, giving them a strong negative charge.The proteins are separated accordingto their molecular mass irrespective of their original electro-chemical charge.The separation medium is a discontinuous gel based on polyacrylamide, and an electric field is applied across the gel, causing the negatively charged proteins to migrateacross the gel towards the anode.The longer the proteins are, the more they are retained in the gel.Changes in the molecular masses of the proteins can be identified by SDS.SDS cleavesnon-covalent linked aggregates into monomers, whereas cova- lent disulfide bridges remain intact.Following electrophoresis, the gel may be stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to makethe separated proteins visible.
To identify allergens separated by electrophoresis, in either 1- or 2-D versions, coupled to MS analysis are usually antibody labelling in blotting setup, using sera from allergic patients as asource of specific IgE are applied. Complex allergen–IgE is usu- ally detected using a conjugated fluorescently labeled poly- clonal anti-human IgE as the secondary antibody.A method for determination of pyruvate kinase, an allergen in whiteleg shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei ), by specific IgE present in patients with a shrimp allergy, was described by Lee et al.(89).The sample protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE.The integrated protein lane on SDS-PAGE was excised manually, and transferred into Eppendorf tubes.After trypsin digestion and peptide extraction, target peptides were analyzed by nano-UPLC-MS.
Authors also demonstrated that various allergensfrom raw or cooked shrimps sensitized patients with crustacean allergy.SDS-PAGE was also applied for analysis of other food aller- gens ( 75). Before SDS-PAGE separation, allergen proteins were extracted by a chaotropic, high-molarity urea buffer in combi- nation with a high-speed stirrer for a quick 2 min manual ex-traction.Following this procedure, extracted allergens wereobtained in a denaturing buffer that can be directly applied to preparation of the tryptic digest without need for a buffer change or precipitation.Obtained extraction efficiency and SDS-PAGE analysis are presented in Figure 12 .After these proce- dures, allergens were determined by LC-MS/MS.Extracted proteins from the rice allergens in rice bran were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by the IgE-binding pro-teins containing the causative allergens in patients with a rice bran allergy ( 90).In the initial step, three kinds of purification methods were applied.
To clarify the protein that needed to betargeted, products containing rice bran were examined; protein extraction of rice allergens were carried out for cosmetics and health foods containing rice bran. Extracted proteins were sepa-rated by SDS-PAGE using reducing conditions.Finally, the IgE- binding proteins containing the causative allergens in patients with a rice bran allergy were identified.The potential causativeallergen of rice bran allergy was identified as a 52- kDa globulin.Western blot analysis using a rice-bran-allergic patient’s plasma showed that 52-kDa globulin was detected as an Ig57E- binding protein of rice bran and some rice bran-containing cos-metics and health foods.Extracted allergen proteins from cashew nut were also sepa- rated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoassay tests(16).Proteins from the milt of large yellow croaker ( P.crocea ) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE ( 23).Allergens separated by SDS-PAGE are often determined by immunological methods Figure 10.

(76), allergen Glycyrrhiza uralensis (64), hazelnut allergens ( 78), olive pollen allergens ( 2), raw and roasted peanut allergens ( 71), N-glyco- forms of soybean allergenic glycoproteins ( 91), allergens from seeds of Ginkgo biloba (80), and almond and hazelnut allergens from roasted nut ( 20).
Immunological analysis such as immuno- blotting was also applied after SDS-PAGE separation e.g., to egg yolk allergens ( 26), peanut allergens ( 92),Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) allergen ( 93), Gly m 4, a soybean allergen ( 21), citrus fruit allergens ( 94), and tree nuts ( 95). SDS-PAGE was applied with ELISA for determination of allergens in food (egg, milk, wheat, peanut, and buck- wheat) ( 15).A new extraction solution containing a human- a n de c o - f r i e n d l yr e d u c t a n ts o d i u ms u l f i t e ,t r i s ( 3 -hydroxypropyl)phosphine, an d mercaptoethylamine sodium sulfite was applied as a 2-mercaptoethanol substitute.In theprocedure, food samples were added to SDS/2-ME or SDS/sub- stitute extraction solutions co ntaining sodium sulfite, Tris (3-hydroxypropyl) phosphine, o r mercaptoethylamine hydro- chloride in a centrifuge tube.
The sample was extracted over- night in a shaker (100 rpm) at room temperature, and the solution was then centrifuged to obtain the supernatant. TheELISA procedure was then car ried out by following the 2-D Quant kit instructions.A modified ELISA in which 2-mercap-toethanol was totally substituted with 0.1 M sodium sulfite was constructed to examine ELISA performance in model- processed and commercial food products.The ability of SDS/0.1 M sodium sulfite for protein extraction was compared tothat of SDS/2-mercaptoethano l solution.The food allergen recoveries of the SDS/0.1 M sul fite ELISAs were compatible with those of the SDS/2-mercaptoethanol ELISAs.The results obtained by different SDS-PAGE for various food samples areshown in Figure 13 .These two methods were also used for analysis of undeclared food allergens in cumin samples ( 10) and milk protein residu es in Cheddar cheese ( 32).Figure 11.

Allergen proteins were separated by 2-DE with application of the pH gradient. In the procedure fortotal protein separation, the immobilized pH gradient stripswere rehydrated passively for 13 h.The voltage settings for iso-electric focusing in the Protean system were 2 h at 250 V, 1 h at1000 V, 3 h at 8000 V, and then kept at 8000 V until a total of 50 000 Vh was reached.After isoelectric focusing and equilibra- tion, the second dimensional SDS-PAGE gels of 12.5% were runat 2 W/gel for 2 h and 12 W/gel for 1.5 h.For each sample, dupli-cate 2-D gels were run under the same conditions.Proteinswere visualized from one gel by scanning after reaction withPonceau S solution and on the other proteins were identified bymultidimensional LC-IT-MS.2-DE was applied for separation of proteins from banana fruit extract ( 30).
In the procedure, banana fruit proteins were resolved by 1-D SDS-PAGE (4% stacking and 12% resolving gel) and then electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane.For identification of proteins resolved by 2-D, PAGE-MS and MS/MS were used. For analysis of allergens, the banana protein ex- tract as mixed with a sample buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, glycerol, and bromphenol blue.The mixture was incubated for5 min at 95 /C14C.Banana fruit proteins were resolved by 1-D SDS- PAGE and were electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by using a semi-dry transfer buffer containing Tris, glycine, methanol, and SDS (pH 8.3).In the next step of theexperiments, blocking was performed with Tris buffered salinecontaining human serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature, IgE reactive proteins were detected by using individual sera of patients with a suspected allergy to banana.
The stripes wereincubated with polyclonal goat anti-human IgE for 1 h, followedby 1 h of incubation with alkaline phosphatase-labeled poly- clonal rabbit anti-goat IgG tertiary antibodies. Visualization of the reaction was performed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate/4-nitroblue tetrazolium.Almond ( Prunus dulcis ) vicilin, a food allergen, was separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–20% polyacrylamide gels with a Tris-[4-(2- hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid] (HEPES)-SDSrunning buffer (100 mM Tris, 100 mM HEPES, 3 mM SDS, pH 8.0)(98).The peptide bands of interest were excised and N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed.Multiple SDS gels were used to assess IgE binding by western blot and for protein detec-tion by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.For western blot, pro-tein bands in the SDS gels were transferred to PVDF membranes.
Paramyosin, a prominent allergen in dust mite allergies, was initially determined by in vivo (prick test) and in vitro (serumspecific IgE) tests ( 99). The allergen was then analysed by 2-D gel electrophoresis combined with immunoblotting and MS.Analysis of low molecular weight allergens and putative al- lergen proteins in lentil ( Lens culinaris ) cultivars of Bangladesh was performed by SDS-PAGE on polyacrylamide gels ( 100).In the procedure, protein from seeds was extracted under denatur- ing conditions using a modified phenol partitioning protocol and precipitated with three different precipitation buffers: ( 1) 0.1 M ammonium acetate in methanol, ( 2) ice cold 75% acetone, and ( 3) ice cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, 20 mM dithiothreitol in acetone.Precipitated protein was resuspended in dissolu- tion lysis buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and quanti-fied using the BCA Protein Kit using bovine serum albuminas a standard.
Protein lysate was diluted four-fold with 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 prior to protein concentration measurement and trypsin digestion. Gel electrophoresis wasperformed under denaturing conditions in 13% polyacrylamidegels using 20 mA per gel.Gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain under standard conditions.LC–MS/MS was then performed on a C18 column.A mixture ofacetonitrile, water, and acetic acid was applied for elution ofanalytes.Allergen proteins were detected by triple quadruple MS coupled to a HPLC system.2-DE immunoblots and MS after 2-DE were applied for determination of putative soybean ( G.max ) allergens ( 24).Soybean protein extracts were diluted to a final volume by rehy- dration buffer containing 8 M urea, 2% 3-((3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate, 50 mM dithiothreitol,and 0.5% ampholyte (pH 3–10) for each 2-DE steps.The samplewas applied to a non-linear 7 cm immobilized pH gradient strip pH 3–10.
Active rehydration was performed at 50 V of direct Figure 12.

The second dimension gel electrophoresis separation was completed using NuPAGEVRNovex 4–12% Bis-Tris ZOOMVRgels. Natarajan et al.analyzed soybean allergen proteins by 2-DE (69).For the first dimension, isoelectric focusing of protein sam- ples was performed using 13 cm pH 4 /C07 and 6 /C011 linear immo- bilized pH gradient (IPG) strips in the IPGphor system.For the second dimension, the IPG strips were incubated with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.002% bromo- phenol blue, 1% DTT, and further acetylated with iodoacetamide.Olive ( Olea europaea L.) pollen allergens were determined by 2-DE with fluorescence-based detection methods ( 96).
Using a combination of high-resolution 2-DE techniques with high-sensitive fluorescence-based detection methods, the identification of a high n umber of allergen forms were possible.2-DE was often applied for separation of allergen peptides before further analysis by immunological methods ( 25,77), MS, MS/MS ( 22,51), or LC-MS/MS ( 51,72). Allergens from sunflower (H.annuus L.), after separation by 2-DE, were analyzed by MS/MS and LC-MS/MS ( 51).After 2-DE by MS/MS were determined, allergens from Curvularia pallescens (CP) (52).Results obtained by SDS-PAGE, 2-D-PAGE, and 2-D immunoblot using pooled sera of patients obtained for C.pallescens allergen proteins are showed inFigure 14 .Examples of applications of SDS-PAGE for allergen analysis in various samples are presented in Table 1 .CE.CE is a family of electrokinetic separation methods per- formed in submillimeter diameter capillaries and in micro- and nanofluidic channels.
In CE methods, analytes migrate through electrolyte solutions under the influence of an electric field. Analytes can be separated according to ionic mobility and/or partitioning into an alternate phase via non-covalent interactions.CE was applied with MPCR for simultaneous determination of 10 food allergens (hazelnut, pistachio, oat, sesame, peanut, cashew, barley, wheat, soybean and pecan) in cake, cookies, Figure 13.SDS-PAGE protein pattern of the food allergen reference materials.Each reference material, egg 0.2 g, milk 0.2 g, wheat 1 g, peanut 0.4 g, and buckwhea t1 g was extracted with 20 mL of the extraction solution containing only SDS, or SDS plus 0.02–0.5 M sodium sulﬁte.The resulting supernatant 7.5 lL was loaded on a lane of NuPAGE 12% gel.After electrophoresis, the protein pattern of the SDS-PAGE gel was visualized by a Rapid CBB staining kit; (A) egg; (B) milk; (C) whea t; (D) peanut; (E) buckwheat.

A bare fused-silica capillary wasinstalled in the CE system and aligned in the electrospray inter- face. The capillary conditioning protocol had the following steps: 1.00 mol/L NaOH (10 min), ultrapure water (15.0 min),0.10 mol/L HCl (10 min), and background electrolyte (10 min) (allwith 200.0 kPa at 35.0 /C14C).After conditioning, the cleaned capil- lary was then aligned in the coaxial electrosprayer.For the final equilibration, the capillary was rinsed with background electro-lyte (10 min, 200 kPa) followed by application of 25.0 kV (10 min with 1.0 min ramp time), all at 35.0 /C14C.Obtained for investigated allergens, TIC electropherogram and MS spectra obtained for in-vestigated allergens are presented in Figure 15 .Parvalbumin, a major allergen in fish was analyzed by CE af- ter background suppression in ion-exchange chromatography (102).For CE, fused silica capillaries with dimensions of 75 lm i.d., 375 lm o.d.
(20 cm effective length, 30.2 cm total length), borate-borax running buffer at concentration 25 mmol/L, and aseparation voltage of 15 kV, were applied. A UV detector set at214 nm was applied for analyte detection.Parvalbumin was de-termined in 2.8 min, with the LOD at 0.71 lg/mL.Examples of application of modern analytical methods cou- pled with different detection techniques for allergens analysisin various samples, and the LOD and LOQ values are presentedinTable 1 .Conclusions Immunological methods are most frequently used for determi- nation of allergens.They are sensitive and can be applied for determination of allergens in trace concentrations, but thelack of specificity and cross-reaction of some antibodies can bea relevant source of errors.Owing to its advantages such as simplicity, good sensitivity, and ease of operation, enzyme-linked ELISA has been a Figure 14.SDS-PAGE and 2D PAGE of total protein of CP and corresponding immunoblots.(A).

Till now, great progresshas been made in boosting the accuracy, sensitivity, and sta-bility to improve traditional ELISA procedures. Connection of ELISA or Nano-ELISA with other techniques such as PCR, DSD-PAGE, and HPLC-MS/MS are newly developed detectionmethods that can realize rapid and sensitive determination ofallergens.Nucleic acid-based methods are fast and reliable for deter- mination of protein allergens.However, the epitopes of proteinallergens with posttranslational modifications and the changes originating during various processing cannot be traced by use of this analytical strategy.PCR technology is commonly used to monitor allergenic ingredients during food processing, with high specificity and a high degree of automation, since DNA is generally more stable than proteins in food processing.However, the applicationof PCR technology to food allergen detection is limited, sinceit is unsuitable for identifying target allergenic proteins with Figure 15.

Biosensors are considered a powerful technology to rapidly analyze various allergens with high sensi-tivity and selectivity. Biosensors demonstrated to be very rapidand easy to use and can be readily implemented as screening methods along to monitor allergens.However, biosensors often require expensive instruments and skilled operators.Hence, itis an urgent requirement to develop simple, accurate, sensitive,inexpensive, and easy-to-use methods to quantify allergens in complicated matrices.Biosensors also offer a viable alternative to traditional analytical techniques due to their potential forminiaturization and label-free online detection.The field of targeted proteomics has advanced rapidly over the last few years, and a number of useful tools and resources for targeted method development are now available.
MS meth- ods for allergen detection and quantification have proved to bevery useful, but require consideration over the complexity of al-lergen molecules and the presence of a complicated matrices. Assessing the recovery of allergens from matrices is one of the most difficult steps to overcome to enable the accurate quantifi-cation of protein allergens by both immunoassay and MS.Recent developments of new high-resolution MS instru- ments are encouraging and enable development in the analysis of allergens.Consequently, fast, very sensitive, reliable, and ac-curate detection and quantification of allergens in complexsamples and the application of MS in routine determination of allergens could be available in the near future.MS, and espe- cially HRMS, is very importanct for the molecular characteriza-tion and analytical detection of allergens.
With the dynamictechnological advancement of mass spectrometers with novel hybrid instruments, the addition of further separation dimen- sions, such as ion mobility, or the renaissance of CE as a separa-tion technique also taken into consideration, it is estimatedthat HRMS will be of growing importance in the future. LC, GC, or electrophoretic methods coupled with MS brings additional advances in allergen analysis.The use of LC-MS orLC-MS/MS for the quantitative detection of allergens in variousmatrices is presently gaining acceptance as a protein-based confirmatory technique over the routinely performed enzyme- linked immunosorbent assays.Quantitative LC-MS or LC-MS/MS of allergens is a field under development, and more meth-ods will be developed in the near future, including multi- allergen assays for the simultaneous determination of several major food allergens from complex processed food matrices.
Because fragrance allergens are usually very volatile, GC with different columns coupled to MS or MS/MS is the most popular technique for their analysis. Selected ion flow tube MS is also another novel technique that can be applied for fra-grance analysis, because of its simplicity, non-destructive sam-ple analysis, very low operating costs, and low maintenance requirements.Often, an LC-MS/MS method is applicable for the detection and quantitation of food allergens in finished food products and ingredients.Predominantly, in proposed methods using triple quadrupole MS and selective MRM of characteristic transitions of precursor ions to fragment ions of multiple proteins and pep- tides to uniquely identify each allergen.It is important to char- acteristic signature peptides were chosen for each allergen, and MRM transitions for each signature peptide were determined based on their uniqueness compared to background proteins and their sensitivity of detection.
Therefore, in the proposedmethods, for each allergen multiple unique peptides were chosen from unique proteins, and two MRM transitions per pep- tide were chosen. The authors who described procedures for the analysis of selected allergens are convinced that these procedures can be easily extended to the detection of others allergens.However, absolute quantification of food allergens requires proper calibration as well as suitable standards, to compensate effects on peptide detectability caused by the food matrix and processing.The use of stable isotopically labeled peptides, which are added to the tryptic digest prior to measurement, has been proposed for the exact quantification of allergenic contam- inants.Another challenge for the exact quantification of food allergens is introduced through food processing, which might affect protein structure.The problem of suitable standards for analysis was also observed.
Alternatively, the solution may be the establishment of a range of biomarkers and properties uti-lizing orthogonal multiplex analytical methods that generate sufficient data to detect allergens irrespective of varietal or other differences. Parallel development of different analytical methodologies accompanied by effective test method validation contribute to improve the quality of allergen analysis and promote best prac-tices in allergen analysis.Gel electrophoresis, in both 1-D and 2-D variants, is a very useful, simple, cheap, and convenient method for the analysis of allergens.From a few hundred to one thousand protein spe- cies can be resolved in a single experiment.Future directions of gel electrophoresis could relate to technical aspects such as miniaturization, nanotechnology of gels, and application of a free-flow electrophoresis format.Multidisciplinarity is important to ensure that analytical methods developed for allergen determination are clinically relevant.
Further research is needed to define signature peptides for most major allergens and to develop new reliable, robust, com- parable, fast, stable, and easy-to-standardize methods for their analysis.
