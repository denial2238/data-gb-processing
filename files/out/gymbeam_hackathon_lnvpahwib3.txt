ASIH is a form of hypogo-nadotropic hypogonadism caused by AAS ’long-term nega- tive feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal(HPG) axis, promoting fatigue, depression and sexual dys-function. Aims: The primary objective of the study is to ex- plore the safety and ef ﬁcacy of clomiphene citrate (CC) in treating ASIH.Secondary aims are to detect AAS associ-ated health risks and assess whether these risks are re-versed 12 months after cessation.Methods: In this open longitudinal pilot study at Oslo University Hospital inNorway, men with AAS dependence, continuous use and adesire to quit are treated for 16 weeks with an antiestrogen(CC).The CC is given to stimulate endogenous secretion ofgonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), gonadotropins(luteinizing hormone (LH)) and testosterone by blockingthe estrogenic negative feedback on the HPG-axis.Transdermal testosterone is administered daily duringtheﬁrst four weeks to prevent a sudden drop in androgen levels.
If HPG response is subpar, human chorionic gonado-tropin (hCG), a synthetic LH analog, is added. The partici-pants are monitored every 4 thweek during intervention, and at follow-up at 6 and 12 months.Physical health is as-sessed through clinical examinations, blood and fat tissuesampling, cardiovascular examination, dual-energy x-rayabsorptiometry, testicular ultrasound and semen analysis.Results: Preliminary results are available from 11 men that were eligible for endocrine intervention with medianage of 33 (range 26-57) and median cumulative lifetimeAAS use of 11 years (1-20).Cardiovascular ﬁndings were re- current and included hypertension, myocardial hyper-trophy, increased arterial stiffness, reducedﬂow-mediated dilation and lower carotid artery reactivity.Polycythemia, testicular atrophy and oligozoospermia were other common ﬁndings at inclusion.
Intervention with CC showed varying HPG response: While some partic-ipants responded poorly to treatment, others developednormalized endogenous levels of gonadotropins and testos-terone after only 4-8 weeks of therapy. No serious adverseevents from CC use were reported.Among the few reportedless severe adverse effects were headache, nausea andmood swings.Conclusion: Preliminary results of this on- going study indicate that treatment with CC and hCG issafe and effective in treating ASIH from long-term continu-ous AAS use.Insuf ﬁcient HPG response after 16 weeks of intervention might indicate persisting hypogonadotropichypogonadism, but further monitoring is needed.Presentation: Friday, June 16, 20231PGIMER, Chandigarh, India;2SKIMS, Srinagar, India; 3JIPMER, Puducherry, IndiaJournal of the Endocrine Society | https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvad114 | A697 J Endocrine Soc, Volume 7, Issue Supplement_1, October –November 2023 A697
