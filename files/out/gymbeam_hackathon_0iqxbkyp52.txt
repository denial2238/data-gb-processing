This review aims to summarize the relationship between serum vitamin D status, assessed by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level, and inflammatory biomarkers in children and adults with asthma.Methods A literature search of interventional and observational studies on 25(OH)D up to November 2022 was conducted across six electronic databases.Outcomes of interest included a range of inflammatory biomarkers classified in four categories: T helper 2 (Th2) pro-inflammatory, non-Th2 pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and non-specific biomarkers.
Study characteristics were extracted and risk of bias was evaluated using the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics tool. Meta-analysis was conducted on studies with a low risk of bias, while narrative reporting was used to present the direction of associations (positive, no association, or negative) for each biomarker, overall and within the low-risk studies.Results We included 71 studies (3 interventional, 68 observational) involving asthma patients.These studies investigated the association between serum 25(OH)D and Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers ( N = 58), non-Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers ( N = 18), anti-inflammatory biomarkers ( N = 16), and non-specific biomarkers ( N = 10).Thirteen (18.3%) studies, 50 (70.4%), and 8 (11.3%) were at high, moderate, and low risk of bias, respectively.
In all studies, irrespective of risk of bias, the most frequently reported finding was no significant association, followed by a negative association between 25(OH)D and pro-inflammatory biomarkers and a positive association with anti-inflammatory biomarkers. In low-risk studies, one biomarker could be meta-analysed.The pooled estimate for 25(OH)D and serum IgE showed a negative association (β (95% CI)= − 0.33 (–0.65 to − 0.01); I2 = 88%; N = 4 studies).A negative association between 25(OH)D and blood eosinophils was also observed in the largest of three studies, as Associations between vitamin D status and biomarkers linked with inflammation in patients with asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventional and observational studies Asmae El Abd1,2*, Harika Dasari1, Philippe Dodin1, Helen Trottier1,2 and Francine M.Ducharme1,2,3 Page 2 of 19 El Abd et al.
Respiratory Research (2024) 25:344 Introduction Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by bronchial hyperreactivity and inflammation leading to preventable symptoms and exacerbations [ 1, 2]. In 2019, approximately 262 million people were affected by asthma, resulting in 455,000 deaths [ 3].Asthma is char - acterized by chronic inflammation that is mediated, in many patients, by T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines, which can enhance the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways, activate resident immune cells, and trigger the release of inflammatory mediators [ 4].Inflammatory bio - markers measured in sputum and serum can be used in disease management, prognosis, and therapeutic adjust - ment [ 5].
Key biomarkers include pro-inflammatory markers of Th2 inflammation, often measured in clinical practice and research in asthma patients, such as immu - noglobulin E (IgE) [ 5–7], eosinophils [ 5, 8, 9], fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) [ 5, 10], interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-5 [ 11], as well as non-Th2 pro-inflammatory bio - markers, including neutrophils [ 12, 13], C-reactive pro - tein (CRP) [ 14, 15], tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) [ 16], and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) [ 17]. Additionally, several anti-inflammatory biomarkers, including regulatory T cells (Tregs) [ 18, 19], the antimicrobial peptide cathelici - din (LL-37) [ 20], and IL-10 [ 11], have also been studied in patients with asthma.Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency represent a global public health problem affecting individuals of all ages, with more than one billion children and adults at risk worldwide [ 21, 22].
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) classifies vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration less than 30 nmol/L and less than 50 nmol/L, respec - tively [ 23]. In patients with asthma, a lower level of serum 25(OH)D has been associated with a greater risk of hos - pital admissions, emergency department visits, exacer - bations, and use of rescue oral corticosteroids (OCS) for asthma [ 24, 25].Several extraosseous anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D have been demonstrated through in vivo studies using animal mod - els, as well as through in vitro cell cultures [ 26].Perhaps even more convincing is the evidence from meta-analy - ses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which report an increase in the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, in both children and adults with asthma after vitamin D supplementation with doses ranging from 800 to 400,000 IU over periods of 6 weeks to 12 months [27].
However, the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and vitamin D status, as assessed by 25(OH) D—the most reliable indicator of vitamin D levels in the human body, influenced not only by vitamin D supple - mentation but also by factors such as diet, sunlight expo - sure, and genetic predisposition [ 28]—is not yet clear. Indeed, numerous observational epidemiological stud - ies conducted in children and adults with asthma have reported an inverse association between serum 25(OH) D levels and pro-inflammatory Th2 [ 29–36] and non-Th2 [36–40] biomarkers, as well as a positive association with anti-inflammatory biomarkers [ 40, 41].However, there is significant heterogeneity and inconsistency in these find - ings.Notably, some studies suggest a different direction of the association between 25(OH)D and these inflam - matory biomarkers in asthma [ 36, 42–44], while others have failed to demonstrate any significant association at all [29, 36, 39, 45–50].
Given these discrepancies, a com - prehensive review is crucial. This systematic review aimed to synthesize the current evidence on the association between vitamin D status (25(OH)D) and inflammatory biomarkers in children and adults with asthma.Materials and methods The research protocol (#CRD42022365666) was regis - tered in the International Prospective Register of System - atic Reviews (PROSPERO).We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with guidelines specified by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement [ 51].Search strategy A comprehensive search for relevant articles published up to November 24, 2022, was conducted by a trained librarian (PD) in six databases, namely PubMed, Medline, All EBM (evidence-based medicine), Embase, CINAHL (cumulative index to nursing and allied health litera - ture), and Web of Science.
The complete search strategy, including Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms and keywords used for each database, is detailed in Addi - tional file 1: Method S1. We also conducted a manual well as with cathelicidin (LL-37) in the only study reporting it.For other biomarkers, most low-risk studies revealed no significant association with 25(OH)D.Conclusion Serum 25(OH)D is negatively associated with serum IgE and possibly with blood eosinophils and LL-37, supporting an in vivo immunomodulatory effect of 25(OH)D.Future research should employ rigorous methodologies and standardized reporting for meta-analysis aggregation to further elucidate these associations.Keywords Inflammation, Asthma, Vitamin D, Biomarkers, Systematic review, Meta-analysis Page 3 of 19 El Abd et al.Respiratory Research (2024) 25:344 search of the bibliography of the selected articles to iden - tify additional relevant studies.
Selection criteria The population of interest consists of individuals diag - nosed with asthma of any age (children and adults), sex, or ethnicity. Studies were eligible if they were RCTs, pre-post intervention studies, or observational stud - ies (cohorts, case‒control, or cross-sectional designs) investigating the association between vitamin D status (25(OH)D) and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with asthma.The exposure of interest was vitamin D sta - tus, either reported as (i) continuous 25(OH)D serum levels or (ii) categorical variable based on definitions (e.g., deficiency, insufficiency, or sufficiency) used by included studies.
Outcomes of interest were all inflammatory bio - markers that were reported in included studies, grouped as follows: (i) pro-inflammatory biomarkers of Th2 inflammation (i.e., IgE, eosinophils, FeNO, Eosinophil Cationic Protein [ECP], IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-33); (ii) pro-inflammatory biomarkers of non-Th2 inflammation (i.e., IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, IL-17, IL-31, CRP , Hs-CRP [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein], TNF- α, IFN-γ, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), neutrophils, and polymorphonuclear [PMN] cells); (iii) anti-inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., Tregs, IL-10, LL-37, transforming growth factor-beta 1 [TGF-β1], and adipo - nectin); and (iv) non-specific biomarkers (i.e., leucocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, Th1/Th2 ratio, hemoglobin, IgG, IgM, IgA, leptin, and resistin). We did not consider the following designs: animal models, in vitro studies, narrative and systematic reviews, opinion papers, case reports, or abstract and conference papers.
We also excluded studies involving mother‒child pairs where vitamin D levels were measured in either the mother or the umbilical cord blood at or before delivery and where inflammatory biomarkers were assessed in the children. Additionally, we did not include interventional studies where patients received any kind of supplemen - tation other than vitamin D (e.g., anti-IgE therapy) or were exposed to vitamin D alongside other vitamins or mineral supplements, except for standard asthma ther - apy.This exclusion criterion was applicable to interven - tional studies in which the inflammatory biomarker was not assessed at baseline before supplementation, but only at the endpoint or as a change from baseline.
This approach was taken to avoid confounding effects of other immunomodulatory interventions on inflammatory bio - markers and to ensure that our analysis focused solely on the relationship between 25(OH)D and inflammatory biomarkers.Study selection and data extraction Two reviewers (AEA and HD) independently screened all titles and abstracts and then reviewed the full texts of those studies deemed relevant. The following informa - tion was extracted independently using a predesigned form: study design, location, sample size, study popula - tion characteristics (number, age, and % male), vitamin D status, inflammatory biomarker results, main statisti - cal analysis methods, and, if applicable, adjustment vari - ables included in statistical models.When multivariable models were presented, we extracted the results from the model with the best fit, including adjustment for relevant variables.
All conflicts between reviewers related to study selection and data extraction were resolved by discussion; the input of a third independent reviewer (FMD) was solicited in cases of disagreement. Covidence systematic review software (2023, Veritas Health Innovation, Mel - bourne, Australia) was used to manage and streamline the process.Quality assessment Two independent reviewers (AEA and HD) evaluated the methodological quality of included studies using the standardized critical appraisal checklist designed by the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [ 52] which comprises ten validity questions related to study design, addressing aspects such as the research question, study population, sampling, intervention or exposure, outcome measurements, statistical analysis, and interpretation of findings.
This tool offers a meticulous and rigorous approach to ensure objectivity, transparency, and repro - ducibility, demonstrating higher inter-observer agree - ment compared to the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool [ 53]. It is also specifically adapted to nutrition-related topics, with a comprehensive focus on nutritional interventions and exposures, making it particularly useful and relevant for our research question [ 54].Reviewers assessed each study individually and determined its quality as high, moderate (neutral), or low risk of bias.Any disagree - ment regarding the methodological quality of a study was resolved by reaching a consensus or by consulting a third reviewer (FMD).Qualitative and quantitative analysis The results were presented both narratively and in tabu - lated form.
A meta-analysis was planned only in studies that used multivariate analysis to adjust for potential con - founding factors or imbalances between groups, when the following criteria were met: (i) at least two studies measured the same inflammatory biomarker from the same body fluid using identical parametrization (i.e., continuous or categorical variable); (ii) adjusted β coef - ficients from multivariable linear regression and standard errors (SE) or 95% confidence intervals (CI) reported Page 4 of 19 El Abd et al. Respiratory Research (2024) 25:344 for inflammatory biomarkers analysed as a continuous variable; (iii) adjusted odds ratios (OR) from multivari - able logistic regression and SEs or 95% CIs reported for inflammatory biomarkers analysed as a categorical vari - able; and (iv) rated as being at low risk of bias.For inflam - matory biomarkers measured at different time points, we only considered the baseline time point.
All 95% confi - dence intervals (CIs) were converted in SEs to facilitate the calculation of the pooled associations. Heterogeneity was assumed if I² was greater than 50% and the P value was less than 0.1 [ 55].Adjusted estimates were combined using the inverse variance method with fixed-effects model when I² was less than 50%; else, a random-effects model was used.To explore the source of heterogene - ity, we planned to conduct subgroup analyses on study design (cohort, case‒control, vs.cross-sectional studies), patient age (children vs.adults), and baseline 25(OH)D levels ( < 50 nmol/L vs.≥ 50 nmol/L).A sensitivity analy - sis was planned after excluding studies with asymmetric data distribution, where the conversion of the 95% CI into SE was imprecise.The analysis was performed using R software, version 2023.09.1 + 494.
When meta-analyses for a given biomarker could not be conducted (i.e., not meeting our stated criteria for aggregation), the following complementary approach was used: for each inflammatory biomarker, we counted the number of studies reporting a significant negative, posi - tive, or no statistically significant association, considering the results from all studies, irrespective of the risk of bias, and then focusing only on studies at low risk of bias. Results Search results The literature search yielded a total of 4,236 publications.After removing 1,891 duplicate records, the remaining 2,345 citations were screened by their title and abstracts, 164 articles were selected for full-text assessment.Sub - sequently, 93 studies were excluded for various reasons, such as not assessing the association between 25(OH)D and inflammatory biomarkers (59 studies), not focusing on asthma (14 studies), and lacking relevant outcomes (3 studies).Finally, 71 studies were included in the review (Fig.
1). Study characteristics Seventy-one eligible studies evaluated the association between vitamin D status and inflammatory biomarkers based on measurements taken at a single point in time at the start of the study.These included 3 interventional studies: 2 RCTs [ 38, 45] and 1 crossover trial [ 56], as well as 68 observational studies, namely: 8 cohort studies [ 29, 30, 44, 46, 57–60], 10 case-control studies [ 31, 39, 40, 42, 47, 61–65], and 50 cross-sectional studies [ 32–37, 41, 43, 48–50, 66–104] (Table 1).Turkey contributed 11 studies (15.5%), followed by Egypt (8 studies, 11.3%) and Iran (5 studies, 7.0%).Other notable contributing countries were China, Poland, and United States (4 studies each, 5.6%).Most studies were published in the past 6 years (Fig.2A).They were conducted predominantly in children ( N = 50), with the remaining focusing on adults ( N = 18) or both pediatric and adult patients ( N = 3), with ages rang - ing from 0 to 80 years (Fig.2B).
The sample sizes of included studies varied widely, ranging from 13 to 847 individuals; collectively, these studies involved 7,787 participants (Fig. 2C).Vitamin D status (25(OH)D) was measured in all included studies, with a reported mean or median baseline values generally above 25 nmol/L, ranging from 29.5 nmol/L [ 92] to 131.0 nmol/L [ 80] with the exception of two studies in which lower values were observed: one study with a median (interquartile range) of 18.5 nmol/L (10.0, 26.0) in a group of individuals with uncontrolled asthma [ 66], and another study showing a mean ± standard deviation of 20.6 ± 2.0 nmol/L in a group of children [ 79].In the remaining 16 studies [ 30, 32, 35, 39, 41, 43, 50, 64, 73, 88–90, 97, 102–104], the mean or median baseline 25(OH)D was not reported.As for vita - min D status categories, most studies ( N = 34) adopted the following classification: deficiency ( < or ≤ 50 nmol/L), insufficiency (50–75 nmol/L), and sufficiency ( > or ≥ 75 nmol/L).
Two studies used an alternative classification namely, deficiency ( < or ≤ 25 nmol/L), insufficiency (25– 50 nmol/L), and sufficiency ( > or ≥ 50 nmol/L) [ 60, 96]. Ten studies adopted a dichotomic classification; 6 stud - ies defining deficiency ( < 50 nmol/L) and sufficiency ( > or ≥ 50 nmol/L) [ 38, 45, 84, 86–88], whereas four studies defined deficiency or insufficiency as values < 75 nmol/L and sufficiency as values > or ≥ 75 nmol/L [ 34, 48, 49, 63].Finally, thirteen studies adopted various other classifica - tions, while eight studies not using any specific classifica - tion criteria [ 33, 41, 57, 70, 85, 93, 102, 103].
Statistical analysis and adjustment variables Of 71 studies, only 14 (19.7%) conducted a multivariate analysis for at least one inflammatory biomarker, adjust - ing for potential confounders such as age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, inhaled corticosteroids, season/month of blood collection, sun exposure, vitamin D supplemen - tation, vitamin D binding protein level, socioeconomic status, smoking status, alcohol consumption, upper respiratory tract infections, pulmonary function, and/ or asthma status [ 29–32, 34, 46, 57, 66, 73, 83, 86, 89, 95, 103]. Other univariate statistical analyses were also uti - lized, mainly the Pearson and Spearman correlation coef - ficients (r/ρ) (45 studies), univariate linear regression (4 studies), Student’s t test (6 studies), Mann‒Whitney U test (6 studies), analysis of variance (ANOVA) (10 stud - ies), Kruskal‒Wallis test (5 studies) and chi-square or Fisher test (4 studies) (Fig.2D).Page 5 of 19 El Abd et al.
Respiratory Research (2024) 25:344 Study quality assessment Eight (3 cohort, 1 case‒control, and 4 cross-sectional) studies (11.3%) were rated at low risk of bias. These studies’ methodology was strengthened by their use of multiple regression models to adjust for confounding variables.Conversely, 13 (1 case‒control and 12 cross- sectional) studies (18.3%) were rated as having a high risk of bias; and the remining 50 (70.4%), at a moderate (neutral) risk of bias.Factors limiting the methodologi - cal quality of these studies included insufficient report - ing of study inclusion & exclusion criteria and/or of data collection methods, lack of adjustment for confounders, no/limited discussion about biases and limitations, and unclear declarations of conflicts of interest.
The meth - odological quality of included studies is detailed in Addi - tional file 2: Table S1.Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers Most (58 of 71 (81.7%)) studies assessed the associa - tion between vitamin D status and at least one Th2 pro- inflammatory biomarker (Fig. 2E).We distinguished 44 studies on serum IgE, 28 on eosinophils (26 on blood and 2 on sputum), 13 on FeNO, three each on IL-13 (two in serum, one in bronchoalveolar lavage) and IL-33 (one in serum, one in plasma, and one in nasopharyngeal fluid), two each on serum IL-4 and ECP , and one on serum IL-5.These included 1 RCT, 5 cohort studies, 6 case‒control studies, and 46 cross-sectional studies [ 29–37, 41–49, 59, 61, 62, 64, 67–79, 81–102, 104].Regardless of the risk of bias, the interventional study (1 RCT) did not detect a significant association between 25(OH)D and Th2 pro- inflammatory biomarkers.In observational studies, most comparisons ( N = 58) also failed to detect significant Fig.

Serum IgE Six (13.6%) studies on serum IgE were rated at low risk of bias [ 29, 31, 32, 46, 73, 95]; all were conducted in chil - dren. Study sample sizes varied from 30 [ 29] to 616 [ 32] participants; their mean baseline 25(OH)D levels ranged from 44.9 nmol/L [ 31] to 64.2 nmol/L [ 29].Due to dis - crepancies in the parameterization of vitamin D and inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., continuous vs.categori - cal variables with different cut-off values), and the lack of reporting values on association estimates or 95% confi - dence intervals (CIs) for certain biomarkers [ 46, 73], our quantitative meta-analysis aggregated four of six low-risk studies [ 29, 31, 32, 95].Using the random-effects model, the pooled estimate showed a significant negative asso - ciation (β (95% CI) = − 0.33 (–0.65 to − 0.01); I2 = 88%; P < 0.01; N = 4 studies) with significant heterogeneity (Fig.4).
The association was affected by: (i) study design, with a stronger correlation between 25(OH)D and serum IgE in the cohort study and cross-sectional studies, than in the case-control study (Fig. 5A) and (ii) baseline vita - min D levels, with a stronger association in studies with mean baseline 25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol/L or unknown, than in those with vitamin D insufficiency (Fig.5B).Subgroup analyses based on patient age could not be conducted, as all included studies pertained to children.A sensitivity analysis that included the three studies with symmetri - cally distributed data confirmed the inverse association between 25(OH)D and IgE but failed to reach statistical significance (β (95% CI) = − 0.19 (–0.52 to 0.13); I2 = 60%; P = 0.08; N = 3 studies) (Fig.5C).
Of note, two small low- risk studies (one cohort and one cross-sectional) that reported their results narratively could not be aggregated in the meta-analysis [ 46, 73]; they mentioned no statisti - cally significant association between 25(OH)D levels and serum IgE levels. In summary, focusing only on studies at low risk of bias on serum IgE, three reported a statis - tically significant negative association, while one large study and two small studies (that did not provide numeri - cal values) concluded to no statistically significant asso - ciation between 25(OH)D and serum IgE levels (Fig.6A).Blood and sputum eosinophils Only three (11.5%) studies, all reporting blood eosino - phils, were rated at low risk of bias [ 29, 32, 46] but aggregation of these studies was not feasible.
A large cross-sectional study demonstrated a statistically sig - nificant negative association in 616 children whose base - line 25(OH)D levels ranged from 31.2 to 245.2 nmol/L (β (95% CI) = − 0.26 ( − 0.48 to − 0.05)) [ 32]. One small cohort study reported no statistically significant asso - ciation between 25(OH)D levels and blood eosinophils in 67 children, with a mean baseline 25(OH)D level of 53.1 nmol/L [ 46].Another small cohort study found no statistically significant association in 30 children with a mean baseline 25(OH)D level of 64.2 nmol/L ( r = 0.009; p value = 0.923) [ 29].Regarding sputum eosinophils, only one cross-sectional study at low risk of bias was identi - fied, involving 297 adults; no significant group difference Reference Country Individuals, n (age, % male) Vitamin D status (25(OH)D, % defi - ciency) (nmol/L) †Inflammatory bio - markers ‡Statistical analysisRisk of bias Wang et al.

In summary, one large study at low risk of bias reported a negative associa - tion between 25(OH)D and serum eosinophils, whereas two small studies failed to identify a significant associa - tion; no statistically significant association with sputum eosinophils was noted in a large adult study.FeNO We identified three (23.1%) cross-sectional studies at low risk of bias that evaluated the association between vita - min D status and FeNO. Two of them reported mean 25(OH)D levels greater than 50 nmol/L [ 86, 95], while other failed to comment on baseline values [ 73].No meta-analysis was feasible.One pediatric study of 86 chil - dren narratively mentioned the absence of a statistically significant association [ 73].Another study involving 413 children, presented no statistically significant association Fig.5 Forest plots for the association between vitamin D status (25(OH)D) (ng/mL) and serum IgE (IU/mL).( A) Adjusted β by study design.( B) Adjusted β by baseline 25(OH)D.

The third study in 297 adults comparing FeNO across various serum 25(OH)D levels found no statistically significant differences ( < 25 nmol/L (β (95% CI) = 1.04 (0.80 to 1.35)); 25-49.9 nmol/L (β (95% CI) = 1.10 (0.90 to 1.34)); 50-74.9 nmol/L (β (95% CI) = 1.13 (0.91 to 1.40)), compared to 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/L serving as the reference category [86]. In conclusion, no statistically significant associa - tions between FeNO and 25(OH)D were reported in two adult and one pediatric studies at low risk of bias.Interleukins We identified one small cohort study at low risk of bias investigating the association between 25(OH)D and two serum interleukins in 30 children with a baseline 25(OH)D level of 64.2 nmol/L [ 29]; no statistically sig - nificant association between 25(OH)D levels and serum IL-4 (β (95% CI) = − 0.10 (–0.80 to 0.46)) or serum IL-13 (r = 0.128; p = 0.099) was observed [ 29].
Non-Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers Eighteen (25.4%) of 71 studies explored the associa - tion between pro-inflammatory biomarkers of non-Th2 inflammation and vitamin D, namely 2 RCTs, 2 cohort studies, 4 case‒control studies, and 10 cross-sectional studies [ 29, 36–41, 45, 57, 62, 63, 71, 74, 80, 83, 88, 100, 103]. We identified seven studies testing serum Hs-CRP/ CRP , five exploring IL-17 in the serum ( N = 3), plasma (N = 1), and airway lavage ( N = 1), four tested serum (N = 3) and plasma ( N = 1) IL-6, three on blood neutro - phils, two each on serum TNF-α, IL-2, and IL-12, and one each on serum IL-3, IL-8, IL-9, IL-1, IFN-γ, IP-10, PMN cells and plasma IL-31.Irrespective of the risk of bias, in interventional studies, 1 RCT did not detect a significant association between 25(OH)D and non-Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers, while another detected a negative association.
In observational studies, the majority ( N = 17) of comparisons did not find any statisti - cally significant association. However, some comparisons (N = 9) showed a negative association between 25(OH) D and non-Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers, while the remainder ( N = 5) indicated a positive association (Fig.3B; Table 1).Only two (11.1%) of these 18 studies on non-Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers were rated as having a low risk of bias [ 29, 57].These studies evaluated the association between 25(OH)D and serum IP-10, IL-2, IL-12, and/or IFN-γ levels [ 29, 57].One cohort study was conducted in 63 children with a median baseline 25(OH)D levels of 32.4 nmol/L in the acute asthma group and 61.1 nmol/L in the controlled asthma group; it demonstrated no sig - nificant association with serum IP-10 levels (β (95% CI): 1.70 ( − 2.6 to 6.0)) [ 57].
Another cohort study involving 30 children with a baseline 25(OH)D level of 64.2 nmol/L also showed no statistically significant associations between 25(OH)D and serum IL-2 ( r = − 0.226; p = 0.072), serum IL-12 ( r = 0.151; p = 0.099), or serum IFN-γ ( r = − 0.195; p = 0.064) levels [ 29]. Overall, in the two small studies at low risk of bias, no meta-analysis was feasible, and no statistically significant associations were observed (Fig.6B).Anti-inflammatory biomarkers Sixteen studies investigated the association between vita - min D status and anti-inflammatory biomarkers.These included 2 RCTs, 6 cohort studies, 2 case‒control studies, and 6 cross-sectional studies [ 29, 30, 34, 36, 38, 40, 41, 46, 50, 56, 58, 60, 63, 66, 72, 87].Overall, seven studies examined the association between 25(OH)D and IL-10 in the serum ( N = 5), plasma ( N = 1) and bronchial lavage (N = 1).
Five studies examined LL-37 measured in serum or plasma (two each) and one in nasal secretions; four focused on blood Treg cells, and one on serum TGF-β. When considering all studies irrespective of the risk of Fig.6 Summary of the type of association for inflammatory biomarkers explored in low-risk bias studies.( A) Pro-inflammatory biomarkers (Th2 inflam - mation) ( N = 7).( B) Pro-inflammatory biomarkers (non-Th2 inflammation) ( N = 2).( C) Anti-inflammatory biomarkers ( N = 2).Abbreviations: FeNO, Frac - tional exhaled nitric oxide; IFN-γ, Interferon gamma; Ig, Immunoglobulin; IL, Interleukin; IP-10, Interferon gamma-induced protein 10; LL-37, Cathelicidin; N, Number of total studies; TGF-β1, Transforming growth factor-beta 1; Tregs, Regulatory T cells Page 14 of 19 El Abd et al.Respiratory Research (2024) 25:344 bias, and for interventional studies (2 RCTs), no statis - tically significant associations between serum 25(OH) D and anti-inflammatory biomarkers were detected.
For observational studies, most comparisons ( N = 8) reported a statistically significant positive association between serum 25(OH)D and anti-inflammatory biomarkers. This was closely followed by no significant association in 7 comparisons, and a negative association in the remain - ing 2 comparisons (Fig.3C; Table 1).Only two studies on anti-inflammatory biomarkers were rated as having a low risk of bias [ 29, 46].These studies evaluated the association between 25(OH)D and serum LL-37, blood Treg cells, and/or serum TGF-β.Both cohort studies were conducted in children with mean baseline 25(OH)D levels > 50 nmol/L [29, 46].One small study ( N = 67) demonstrated a statis - tically significant negative association between 25(OH)D levels and serum LL-37 (β (95% CI) = − 0.018 (–0.032 to − 0.003)) [ 46].
The other study found no statistically sig - nificant association between 25(OH)D levels and Treg cells (β (95% CI) = 0.41 (0.23 to 0.50), IL-10 ( r = − 0.099; p = 0.283), or TGF-β ( r = − 0.170; p = 0.064) [ 29] (Fig. 6C).Non-specific biomarkers Ten of 71 (14.1%) studies evaluated the association between vitamin D status and non-specific biomarkers that are neither pro- nor anti-inflammatory (1 cohort study, 3 case‒control studies, and 6 cross-sectional stud - ies) [ 37, 40, 50, 58, 64, 65, 72, 80, 88, 91].No study was rated at being at a low risk of bias.Overall, the majority (N = 11) of investigations reported no statistically signifi - cant association with non-specific biomarkers; a minority of comparisons ( N = 6) observed a statistically significant negative association, and one, a positive association with these biomarkers (Fig.3D; Table 1).
Discussion This review summarizes 71 studies exploring the asso - ciation between serum vitamin D status (25(OH)D) and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with asthma. Of these, only eight studies (11.3%) were rated at a low risk of bias and served as the main basis for our conclusions.A meta-analysis of 4 studies was possible for a single bio - marker—a Th2 pro-inflammatory type—showing a sta - tistically significant negative association between serum 25(OH)D levels and serum IgE levels.In the small num - ber of remaining studies at low risk of bias, the diversity of biomarkers studied, the variety of metrics used, and incomplete reporting prevented the quantitative aggre - gation of data.The reporting of the studies’ direction of associations within the context of a narrative review pro - vided some information.
However, the inability to take into consideration the precision of results—that is, to dis - tinguish between evidence of no effect and no evidence of effect due to insufficient power in many studies—made it challenging to draw firm conclusions about the true association between 25(OH)D serum levels and most biomarkers. For Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers, our meta-anal - ysis of four studies at low risk of bias revealed that for every 2.5 nmol/L (1 ng/mL) increase in 25(OH)D levels, serum IgE decreased by about 0.33 IU/mL.As subgroup analyses highlighted a stronger association in children with 25(OH)D levels above 50 nmol/L or unknown than others, the linearity of the association remains to be established across the whole spectrum of 25(OH)D lev - els.
The two remaining small studies at low risk of bias that narratively reported no significant association, failed to provide numerical values of the effect’s magnitude or precision, thus preventing any worthwhile contribu - tion to the conclusions. We were unable to find previ - ous reviews examining the association between 25(OH) D levels and IgE, confirming a gap in the literature that our review begins to address.However, our results align with other observational studies involving patients with inflammatory diseases that have reported a negative association between 25(OH)D and serum IgE, although without adjusting for potential confounders.Indeed, in children with gastrointestinal food allergies and atopic dermatitis, an inverse correlation between vitamin D and IgE levels was noted, with correlation coefficients ranging from − 0.4 to −0.5 [ 105, 106].
As for eosinophils, although two small studies that could not be aggregated failed to identify a significant association, possibly due to lack of power, we identified one large study that found a statis - tically significant negative association between blood eosinophils and serum 25(OH)D; whereas the magni - tude of the effect corresponded to a weak association, the lower limit (more negative) of the confidence inter - val indicated a moderate effect size. This observed nega - tive association is supported by the results of a study conducted in children with gastrointestinal food allergy, where children with low 25(OH)D ( < 75 nmol/L) had per - sistent blood eosinophilia compared to those with higher 25(O)HD ( ≥ 75 nmol/L) (56% vs.25%, P < 0.05) [ 105].No significant associations with other Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers, including FeNO, were observed, and we could not find any previous reviews examining the asso - ciation between 25(OH)D levels and those biomarkers.
Collectively, our analysis suggests a negative association between serum 25(OH)D and serum IgE, and possibly with blood eosinophils; no apparent association with FeNO; and insufficient data to conclude on other Th2 biomarkers in asthma. When examining evidence from systematic reviews of vitamin D supplementation trials on Th2 inflammatory biomarkers, the findings do not suggest a causal rela - tionship for the negative association between 25(OH)D Page 15 of 19 El Abd et al.Respiratory Research (2024) 25:344 and Th2 inflammatory biomarkers, that is, a significant decrease in these biomarkers following supplementa - tion.
Our 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 intervention studies—testing vitamin D supplementa - tion (cholecalciferol, calcidiol, and calcitriol) doses rang - ing from 800 to 400,000 IU over periods of 6 weeks to 12 months—revealed no significant group difference at study endpoint compared to placebo, in serum IgE lev - els (4 RCTs, Mean difference [MD] [95% CI]: 0.06 [-0.13, 0.26] IU/mL), blood eosinophils (3 RCTs, MD [95% CI]: − 0.02 [-0.11, 0.07] 103/µL), FeNO (3 RCTs, MD [95% CI]: -4.10 [-10.95, 2.75] ppb), or other Th2 interleukins namely serum [ 107], sputum [ 108], exhaled breath con - densate IL-4 [ 109], and sputum IL-13 [ 108], among 1459 adults and children with asthma [ 27]. Our later findings are concordant with previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs that included the same or fewer trials testing the impact of supplementation [ 110–112].
Due to insufficient reporting, we were unable to aggre - gate data to examine whether, compared to placebo, vita - min D supplementation was associated with significant within-patient decrease from baseline in Th2 biomark - ers. However, a significant decrease in serum IL-13 was observed in 86 adult patients supplemented with a daily dose of calcitriol for 6 months [ 113].Indeed, included most supplementation trials did not adjust for baseline values of biomarkers and potential confounders, nor did they report the within-patient change in biomark - ers between groups.Consequently, it remains unclear whether the observed inverse cross-sectional association between 25(OH)D and serum IgE (and potentially blood eosinophils) in this review reflects a direct effect of vita - min D deficiency, an indirect effect through other media - tors, or a spurious association.
As for non-Th2 pro-inflammation, studies at low risk of bias identified in this review did not find a statisti - cally significant association between 25(OH)D levels and a variety of biomarkers, namely IP-10, IL-2, IL-12, or IFN-γ. No study at low risk of bias was identified for non-specific biomarkers, making it impossible to gener - ate hypotheses.Additionally, no prior systematic reviews have been found on the association between 25(OH)D and either non-Th2 pro-inflammation or non-specific biomarkers in other inflammatory conditions.In a sup - plementation trial, no significant difference was observed at the 12-month endpoint in sputum IL-2 and IFN-γ lev - els in 250 adults supplemented bi-monthly with 120,000 IU of cholecalciferol compared to a placebo [ 108].
The paucity of studies at low risk of bias, including supple - mental trials, prevent any firm conclusion regarding a potential association between vitamin D level or supple - mentation and non-Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers. Regarding anti-inflammatory biomarkers, the only one (small) study at low risk of bias reported a statistically significant negative association between 25(OH)D lev - els and serum LL-37 in children, suggesting less anti - microbial activity in those with higher 25(OH)D levels; no statistically significant associations were found for IL-10, Treg cells, or TGF-β.Of note, a supplemental trial alluded to the opposite conclusion.Indeed, in 86 adults with asthma, supplementation with calcitriol for 6 months resulted in a significantly greater increase in sputum LL-37 and serum IFN-γ compared to the pla - cebo group [ 113], suggesting more antimicrobial activity with greater 25(OH)D levels.
This is in concordance with a study in primary cultures of normal human and cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells, which showed that vita - min D up-regulates cathelicidin expression and enhances antimicrobial activity in both settings [ 114]. Overall, the evidence from our studies at low risk of bias and supple - mentation trials suggests that 25(OH)D levels are pos - sibly associated with LL-37, but the direction of effect needs to be clarified.Our findings revealed a negative association with IgE, and possibly with blood eosinophils and LL-37, con - sistent with recent mechanistic reviews.These reviews indicate that vitamin D reduces levels of pro-inflamma - tory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α [ 115, 116].
Moreover, evidence suggests that vitamin D influences B lymphocytes by inhibiting their differentiation, limit - ing their proliferation, and decreasing immunoglobulin production such as IgE, while also boosting IL-10 pro - duction, thereby exerting an additional regulatory effect [115, 116]. It is important to note the dual role of LL-37, which can exhibit both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, either directly stimulating inflammatory cells or modulating the cellular response to specific cytokines or signals, which potentially explain the divergent find - ings.Remarkably, it can rapidly transition from an anti- inflammatory to a pro-inflammatory state under certain conditions [ 117, 118].Our findings underscore the multifaceted role of vitamin D in modulating immune responses, highlighting its potential as a crucial regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity.
Yet, the paucity of high-quality in vivo data prevents any firm conclu - sion about this validity of these purported mechanisms of action in asthma patients. Strengths and limitations Our systematic review has several strengths and limita - tions.First, our study was comprehensive, as evidenced by our broad literature search across several databases, the incorporation of various study designs, adult and pediatric populations, and a wide range of inflammatory biomarkers.Whereas the variability in the populations studied, in age, comorbidities, vitamin D status catego - ries, and asthma control status contributed to signifi - cant heterogeneity, it also increased the generalisability Page 16 of 19 El Abd et al.Respiratory Research (2024) 25:344 of our findings.
We adhered to well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, independent quality assessment using a validated tool, systematic and rigorous approach to data extraction and assessment of analytic methods and focused our conclusions on studies at low risk of bias. However, the large body of evidence is weakened by the small number of studies at low risk of bias (e.g., no, or inadequate adjustment for confounding, incomplete reporting of study selection criteria and/or of data col - lection methods, use of various metrics that prevented aggregation).Whereas this review included interven - tion supplementation trials, most of them reported the 25(OH)D and biomarkers at baseline and not over time.Consequently, the cross-sectional association between 25(OH)D levels and some inflammatory biomarkers observed in this review, do not imply causation as they could be due to type 1 error or reverse causality.
Indeed, we cannot rule out the possibility that uncontrolled asthma might be independently associated with both a rise in Th2 biomarkers and reduced 25(OH)D, if the later acts as an acute phase response to inflammation [ 119] or if uncontrolled disease is associated with reduced sun exposure [ 120, 121] and thus vitamin D synthesis [ 122]. Consequently, monitoring these biomarkers in the con - text of interventional vitamin D supplementation trial are crucial for tracking temporal changes and estab - lishing support for or against a cause-and-effect rela - tionship.Also, complete reporting of studies with high methodological quality, featuring larger sample sizes, robust designs, precise measurements, and strategies to minimize bias and reduced imprecision (e.g., by treating 25(OH)D levels as a continuous variable) are essential to better address the questions.
This approach would facili - tate the pooling of data for future meta-analyses, thereby offering more comprehensive insight into the in vivo mechanism of action of vitamin D in asthma patients by clarifying the direction, magnitude, and precision of associations. Conclusion Most of the published evidence regarding the associa - tion between 25(OH)D and inflammatory biomarkers is at significant (high or moderate) risk of bias, resulting in a paucity of methodologically strong studies on which to base firm conclusions.Studies at low-risk of bias suggest a negative, but not robust, association between vitamin D status and serum IgE levels, a probably negative associa - tion with blood eosinophils and serum LL-37; collectively alluding to an immunomodulatory effect of vitamin D.Future interventional and longitudinal studies, adjust - ing for confounders, should examine the association over time between serum 25(OH)D levels and inflammatory biomarkers, to clarify our observations.
Understand - ing this relationship is crucial for developing targeted interventions and clinical guidelines aimed at optimiz - ing vitamin D levels to manage inflammation in asthma patients effectively.
