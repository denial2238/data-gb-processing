Results: The cumulative incidence of T2D at median follow-up of 5.3 years was 3.98 cases/1000 PY among the vitamin D group and 4.37 cases/1000 person years (PY) for placebo (intention-to-treat hazard ratio [HR] =0.91 [0.76, 1.09]). Results were not signi ﬁcantly modi ﬁed by age, sex, race, BMI, or baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.In a meta-analysis of three eligible randomized trials (N=25,154 participants), the relative risk (RR) for T2D with vitamin D vs.placebo was 0.89 (0.80, 1.00); p =0.049.In a meta-analysis the RR was 0.75 (0.60, 0.94) among par- ticipants with BMI <30 kg/ m2at baseline, but was 0.99 (0.84, 1.17 among those with obesity (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2) (p-interaction =0.19).There were minimal effects of vitamin D vs.placebo on glycemic traits in the clinic subcohort over- all.In analyses stratifying by baseline BMI, we observed in- creased HOMA- βand insulin response during oral glucose challenge at 2y for BMI <30 kg/m2with vitamin D vs.

Objective: To evaluate whether vitamin D sup- plementation reduces risk of T2D in a general population of older US adults.Design: The Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL) is a completed ﬁve-year randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled 2x2 supplementation trial of vita-min D 3(cholecalciferol; 2000 IU per day) and omega-3 fatty acids (1 g per day) for the primary prevention of cancer andcardiovascular disease.VITAL-T2D, a pre-speci ﬁed ancil- lary study initiated prior to trial enrollment, tested the ef-ﬁcacy of vitamin D supplementation on incident T2D risk.
We also conducted a pre-registered systematic review andrandom effects meta-analysis of vitamin D trials ( ≥1000 IU/d cholecalciferol) reporting effects on T2D risk.Participants: We analyzed 22,220 VITAL participants without T2D at baseline in 2011-2014. Mean age andbody mass index (BMI) were 67.2 years (SD =7.1) and 27.5 kg/m 2(SD=5.3), respectively, with 51% female and 17% African American.In addition, we analyzed change in gly-cemic traits at 2 years in a subcohort of 918 participants at-tending in-person clinic visits.Results: The cumulative incidence of T2D at median follow-up of 5.3 years was3.98 cases/1000 PY among the vitamin D group and 4.37cases/1000 person years (PY) for placebo (intention-to-treathazard ratio [HR] =0.91 [0.76, 1.09]).Results were not sig- niﬁcantly modi ﬁed by age, sex, race, BMI, or baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.In a meta-analysis of three eli-gible randomized trials (N =25,154 participants), the rela- tive risk (RR) for T2D with vitamin D vs.
placebo was0.89 (0.80, 1.00); p =0.049. In a meta-analysis the RR was 0.75 (0.60, 0.94) among participants with BMI <30 kg/ m 2 at baseline, but was 0.99 (0.84, 1.17 among those with obes- ity (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2) (p-interaction =0.19).There were minimal effects of vitamin D vs.placebo on glycemic traitsin the clinic subcohort overall.In analyses stratifying bybaseline BMI, we observed increased HOMA- βand insulin response during oral glucose challenge at 2y for BMI <30 kg/ m 2with vitamin D vs.placebo, but no bene ﬁt for partici- pants with obesity.We did not observe effect modi ﬁcation by other variables.Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementa- tion of 2000 IU/d did not signi ﬁcantly reduce T2D risk in a general population of US adults, but the updated meta-analysis supports potential bene ﬁts among adults without obesity.Trial and Systematic Review Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01169259 and NCT01633177; PROSPERO: CRD42019147562.
