Keywords: chronickidneydisease(CKD),magnesium,vascu- larcalcification INTRODUCTION Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [ 1]. Vascular calcification is an important pathophysiological process in- volved in cardiovascular disease in these patients and a major contributortotheincreasedall-causeandcardiovascularmor- tality [2,3].Calcification of the vascular wall is characterized bydepositionofcrystallinecalcium-phosphateintheextracel-lularmatrixofthetunicamediaofarteries.InCKD,thisoccurs inamilieuofimbalancebetweenprocalcifyingfactorsandcal- cification inhibitors [ 4–6].
The process involves, among other factors, the formationofamorphousnanoparticlescontaining proteinsandcalciumandphosphateandthetransformationof these primary calciprotein particles (CPPs) into crystalline or secondaryCPPs[ 7].Inaddition,vascularsmoothmusclecells (VSMCs) undergo osteogenic transformation with increased expression of osteogenic differentiation-related genes [ 8,9]. These VSMCs secrete matrix vesicles and apoptotic bodies containing calcium/phosphate nanocrystals and are depleted from mineralization inhibitors, which provide a nidus for mineralnucleationandmaturation[ 10].In patients with CKD, plasma magnesium concentrations are inversely associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [ 11].In addition to anti-arrhythmic effects of magnesium,inhibitionofvascularcalcificationbymagnesium may contribute to these associations [ 12–14].
Plasma mag- nesium concentrations have also been inversely associated withvascularcalcificationinpatientswithCKD[ 15–17].This suggests that an increase of magnesium concentrations may retard vascular calcification in the clinical setting and benefit patients with CKD. Explorative studies with magnesium- based interventions in patients with CKD, both dialysis dependent and independent, have indeed shown beneficial effects on several markers of calcification, including carotid intima-media thickness, coronary artery calcification score and calcification propensity score [ 18–21].
Studies that used various animal models of CKD, induced by the toxicity of adenine or with high-dose calcitriol, showed beneficial effects of magnesium supplementation on the development of vascular calcification [ 22–24].In vitro,m a g n e s i u mi sa b l e to inhibit phosphate-induced calcification in the extracellular medium of VSMC cultures, in conjunction with inhibited expression of osteogenic differentiation-related genes [ 25, 26]. However, the mechanisms by which magnesium inhibits vascularcalcification in vitroareincompletelyunderstood.1050 N.H.J.Leenders et al.

Inthisstudyweusedpartiallynephrectomizedratsasanan- imalmodelofCKDtostudytheeffectsofanincreaseddietary magnesiumcontentonthedevelopmentofaorticvascularcal- cification.We aimed to determine whether increased dietary magnesium intake inhibits vascular calcification in CKD in vivo.
Besides retarding mineralization per se, possible effects of magnesium may be inhibition of gene expression involved in osteogenic differentiation or a reduction of absorption and concentration of other minerals, including calcium and phos- phate. Therefore we measured concentrations and excretion of electrolytes and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of genes involved in osteogenic differentiation in the aorta in order to further explore the mechanisms underlying effects of magnesiumsupplementationonvascularcalcification.MATERIALSAND METHODS Ethicalstatementandstudydesign TheexperimentswereconductedinaccordancewithEuro- pean Directive 2010/63 EU on the protection of animals used forscientificresearch,andwereapprovedbytheRadboudUni- versityAnimalsExperimentsCommitteeandtheNetherlands Central Authority for Scientific Procedures on Animals (RU- DEC 2016-0096/AVD1030020172225).
The study design is showninFigure 1.After1weekofacclimatization,46Sprague Dawleyratsat6weeksofageunderwentapartialnephrectomy asdescribedbelow.FollowingthisinductionofCKD,ratswere randomlyallocatedtoadietwithhighphosphatecontent(1.2% w/w)thatwaseithermagnesiumenriched(0.48%w/w)orwith normal magnesium (0.05% w/w). Blood was drawn from the tail vein at baseline and after 8 and 16 weeks.Animals were housedindividuallyfor24hforsamplingofurine,asdescribed indetailbelow.Ratsweresacrificedbycardiacpunctureunder general anaesthesia with isoflurane after 16 weeks or when a humane endpoint was reached, and blood was collected.Aortas were harvested from all animals that had completed a studyperiodo fa tleast8weeks.Experimentalanimals,housingandhusbandry S p r a g u eD a w l e yr a t s[ C r l :C D ( S D ) ] ,2 3m a l e sa n d2 3 females, were purchased at 5 weeks of age from the Charles River Laboratories, Erkrath, Germany.
Animals were housed withmaximallytwoanimalspercageinindividuallyventilated cages (Greenline) with corn cob bedding and a polycarbonate rat retreat for environmental enrichment in a temperature- controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Drinking water andfoodweresupplied ad libitum .Fiveanimalspergroupwere housed individually in metabolic cages for 24 h at week 8 for thecollectionofurineformeasurementsofmineralexcretion.Animals were monitored daily during the entire experimental period and weighed daily in the first 3 weeks after surgery and twice weekly thereafter.In the case of abnormal activity, abnormal appearance or inadequate recovery from surgery that could not be resolved or in the case of a 20% decrease in body weight, a humane endpoint was reached and the animal waseuthanized.Experimentalprocedures Nephrectomy surgery.In one surgical procedure under generalanaesthesiawithisoflurane,areductionofin-between 3/4 and 5/6 of total functional kidney tissue was performed.
First, the left kidney was exposed and decapsulated, and o n eo rm o r eb r a n c h e so ft h el e f tr e n a la r t e r yw e r el i g a t e d to induce infarction of minimal 1/2 and maximal 2/3 of this kidney. In the same procedure, the right kidney was exposed, decapsulated and removed in total after ligation of the hilar structures (artery, vein and ureter).For analgesia, buprenorphine was administered intramuscularly (30 μg/kg bodyweight; Astfarma, Oudewater, The Netherlands) during surgeryandattheendoftheoperationday,andonindication, oneadditionaldosewasgivenonthenextday.Dietary interventions.Rats were fed an AIN93M syn- thetic diet with 0.75 mg/kg vitamin K 1(phylloquinone), no vitamin K 3(menadione) and 1000 IU/kg vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) (Ssniff Spezialdiäten, Soest, Germany), as DietarymagnesiumsupplementationinCKD 1051 originally described for this diet [ 27].
In the week before surgery, all animals received this diet with a standard phos- phate (0.32% w/w) and normal magnesium (0.05% w/w) content. After surgery, phosphate in the AIN93M diet was increased to 1.2% w/w to induce vascular calcification.In the intervention group, the diet after surgery was magnesium enriched (0.48% w/w) and the control group received a diet withnormalmagnesium(0.05%w/w).Aortaprocessingandtissuestaining After sacrifice, the aorta was dissected, perfused with phosphate-buffered saline, cleaned and cut into three parts of equal length: arch, thoracic and abdominal.Each anatomical part was split into three pieces.The proximal piece and distal piece of each anatomical part were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C, for calcium content measurements and RNA extraction, respectively.The middle pieces of each anatomical part were stored in formalin 10% v/v for at least 24 h.
After dehydration and clearing in xylene, this tissue was c u ti n t ot w ot of o u rr i n g st h a tw e r ee m b e d d e di np a r a ffi n positioned next to each other to assess multiple height levels ofthetissueforthepresenceofcalcification.Afterrehydration, tissuesectionsof4 μmwerestainedaccordingtothevonKossa staining method, which stains phosphate in calcium deposits. Sections were immersed in 1% w/v silver nitrate for 30 min underconstantultravioletlightexposure(365nm),afterwhich excessivesilverwasremovedby5%w/vsodiumthiosulfateand sections were counterstained in nuclear fast red, cleared and mountedwithPertex(Histolab,Göteborg,Sweden).Tissuecalciumcontent Theproximalpiecesofallthreeanatomicalaortapartswere used for quantitative measurement of calcification expressed by tissue calcium content.
Tissue was freeze dried using a vacuum freeze dryer (Christ, Osterode, Germany) for 12 h, weighed and incubated in a 10–50-fold excess of 10% w/v formicacidfor24h.Thesupernatantwasusedforassessment of tissue calcium content by the colorimetric cresolphthalein method(RandoxLaboratories,Crumlin,UK)accordingtothe manufacturer’s manual. All measurements were performed in duplicate.RNAisolationandreal-timequantitativepolymerase chainreaction(qPCR) The distal pieces of all three anatomical aorta parts were used for RNA extraction.Total RNA was extracted from t h ea o r t i ct i s s u es t o r e da t– 8 0 ° Cu s i n gT R I z o l( I n v i t r o g e n , Bleiswijk,TheNetherlands)accordingtothestandardprotocol after tissue homogenization.Total RNA was treated with DNase (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands) to break down genomicDNA.ToobtaincDNA,M-MLVreversetranscriptase (Invitrogen) was used for reverse transcription (RT) for 1 h at 37°C.
RT-qPCR was executed in duplicate using IQ SYBR- Green Mix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) usinga Bio-Rad thermocycler. Relative expression was determined by the Livak method and shown as a fold change compared with the control group (0.05% w/w Mg) and normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression [ 28].Thep rimersar elistedinS u p plemen taryda ta,T ableS1.Mineralsandkidneyfunction Plasmawascollectedfromblooddrawninlithium–heparin gel tubes (Multivette 600 LH, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) that were centrifuged at 2000 gfor 5 min.The following mea- surements were performed: magnesium with the colorimetric xylidyl blue method; calcium with the colorimetric 5-nitro- 5′-methyl-BAPTA (NM-BAPTA) method; albumin with the colorimetric bromocresol-purple method and phosphate, cre- atinine and urea with enzymatic methods.All measurements wereperformedwithreagentsfromRochewiththeCobas8000 automatic analyser (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).

Per cohort, animals were randomly allocated to the two experimental groups, stratified by sex, using the website www.random.org/sequences . In addition, the order of the nephrectomy per cohort was randomized.Samplecollectionandoutcomemeasurementswereperformed in the same order.Diets were allocated to the groups by an independent laboratory worker.Researchers and laboratory personnel involved in the experiments were blinded to the treatment.Unblinding was not performed before the analysis ofthemainoutcomeparameterswascompleted.Statistics Data were analysed using SPSS for Windows (version 26; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and GraphPad Prism for Windows (version 8.2.1; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).Continuous variables are expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed variables or median and interquartile range (IQR) for non-parametric distributed variables.
In addition, tissue calcium content for each aorta segment was categorized into tertiles for lowest, intermediate and highest calcium content. Categorical variables are pre- sented as numbers and percentages.Analysis of differences betweentheexperimentalgroupswasperformed.Eachanimal was considered an experimental unit within the groups.For theoutcometissuecalciumcontent,inadditiontotheanalyses per aortic segment, a pooled analysis was performed in which all aortic segments were included and each aortic piece was considered a separate experimental unit.In addition, in order to take into account the duration of exposure, calcium apposition time was calculated by dividing the tissue calcium content by the number of days of follow-up until the aorta was harvested.Significance was assessed with the Student’s t- test for normally distributed continuous variables and with the Mann–Whitney U-test for non-parametrically distributed continuous variables.
For categorical variables, significance was assessed with the Pearson’s chi-quadrate test. Significance was assessed as two-sided in all analyses.Differences with P<.05wereconsideredstatisticallysignificant.RESULTS Animalsandexperimentalcourse T h em e a nb o d yw e i g h to ft h ea n i m a l sa tb a s e l i n ew a s 192±35 g.Body weight, kidney function markers creatinine andurea,andelectrolytesmagnesium,phosphateandcalcium at baseline were comparable between the two diet groups (Table1).

Results for calcium apposition time in each aortic segmentcorrespondedtotheresultsfortissuecalciumcontent and showed that the number of animals in the highest tertile of calcium apposition time was significantly lower in the abdominal aorta [1 (10%) versus 6 (55%); P=.03] in the high versus the normal magnesium group and did not differ betweenthegroupsintheaorticarch[2(20%)versus5(46%); P=.22] and thoracic aorta [2 (20%) versus 5 (46%); P=.22] (Supplementarydata,FigureS2).Calcificationoftheaorta:tissuestaining Tissue von Kossa staining confirmed the presence of calcification in the aortic wall.

Bonequality Micro-CT showed abnormal high cortical porosity or cortical trabecularization and dense trabecular bone with an abnormal appearance in femurs from rats of both diet groups. A normal morphological appearance of femurs was observed in some of the animals in the high dietary magne- sium group (43%) but not in the normal magnesium group (Supplementarydata,FigureS4andTableS2).DISCUSSION Summaryofprincipalfindings This study demonstrates that high dietary magnesium inhibits abdominal aorta calcification in CKD in vivo,w h i c h was shown here in a rat model of nephrectomy-induced CKD andhighdietaryphosphate.This protective effect was shown in this aortic segment by a smaller number of animals with calcium content in the highest tertile in the high dietary magnesium-treated group.
Therewasnodifferenceinserumphosphateconcentrationsor urinary phosphate excretion between the dietary magnesium groups, indicating that this beneficial effect is not mediated by phosphate-binding actions of dietary magnesium in the gastrointestinal tract. Serum magnesium concentration and urinary magnesium excretion were substantially increased in the high dietary magnesium–treated group, indicating that dietarymagnesiumwasabsorbedandavailableforendogenous effects.The effect could not be explained by inhibition of osteogenic transformation of VSMCs, as there was no differenceintheexpressionofosteogenicmarkersinvesselwall cellsbetweenthedietarymagnesiumgroups.Relationwithpreviousstudiesandcurrenttheory Other studies have also demonstrated inhibiting effects of anincreaseddietaryintakeofmagnesiumonthedevelopment of aortic vascular calcification in various animal models of CKD with hyperphosphatemia [ 22–24].

Although numerically more calcification in the other segments of the aorta was noted as well in our study, this was not significant, possibly due to limited power as a consequence of the higher than expected dropout. However, another study that analysed thethoracicsegmentonlydemonstratedthattheeffectsarenot limitedtotheabdominalaorta[ 23].In some studies, magnesium (added as magnesium citrate intragastricallyormagnesiumcarbonateinthediet)attenuated hyperphosphatemia and therefore phosphate-binding actions of magnesium in the gastrointestinal tract may have been at least partially responsible for the effects on vascular calcification in those experiments [ 24,33].In our data and another study, there were no differences in plasma phosphate concentration or 24- h urinary phosphate excretion between the groups, suggesting that magnesium can inhibit vascular calcification independent of phosphate binding in the gastrointestinal tract [ 22].
Moreover, in another study that supplemented magnesium sulphate by intraperitonealinjection, vascular calcification was decreased, a setup that precludes an additional protective mechanism by binding of dietaryphosphate[ 23]. Previous studies used animal models that included an ade- nine diet or the administration of calcitriol [ 22–24].In these models, other mechanisms may have influenced the effects, like more pronounced inflammation in the adenine models, andnon-physiologicalmanipulationofcalciumandphosphate homeostasis in the high calcitriol models.We investigated partiallynephrectomizedratswithouttheadditionofanyother potentiallytoxicsubstances.The mechanisms by which absorbed magnesium inhibits vascularcalcificationarestillincompletelyunderstood.
In vitro,highphosphateconcentrationsinducecalcification of the extracellular compartment surrounding human VSMC cultures, along with an increased expression of osteogenic differentiation–related genes, which can be inhibited by the addition of magnesium [ 25,26]. The protective effect of magnesium disappeared after inhibition of the magnesium transporter TRPM7 by 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2- APB), suggesting that magnesium influx is required and intracellular mechanisms are involved [ 25,26,34].However, DietarymagnesiumsupplementationinCKD 1055 FIGURE3: Calcificationoftheaorta,identifiedbyvonKossastaining,inpartiallynephrectomizedratsfedeitherahighornormalmagnesium diet.(A–C)ThepercentageofanimalswithineachgroupinwhichcalcificationwasdetectedwithvonKossastaininginthe( A)ao rticar chand (B)thoracicand( C)abdominalaorta.

In animals with kidney failure, a reduction of osteogenic expression was seen in studies in which magnesium caused a reduction of serum phosphate concentrations, but that effect might have been mediated by the lower phosphate concentration itself [ 23,24].Inourstudy and another study, in which the increased magnesium intake did not affect serum phosphate concentrations, no reduction ofexpressionofbone-relatedgeneswasobserved[ 22]. I nap r e v i o u ss t u d yf r o mo u rg r o u p ,o s t e o m a l a c i aw a s observed in Klotho knockout mice on a high magnesium diet [36].The current data show that in partially nephrectomized rats on a high phosphate diet, bone abnormalities occurred in both the high and normal magnesium groups and bone quality was not lower in the high dietary magnesium group.Thissuggeststhattheseboneabnormalitiesresultedfromrenalosteodystrophy per se and that the high magnesium diet did notha vean yharmfuleffectso nbo nequali ty .

Calcification was measured quantitativelybytheamountoftissuecalciumand,inaddition, thecalcificationwasconfirmedvisuallybyvonKossastaining.We defined the study endpoints that were set before the study wasinitiated.This study also has several limitations.A substantial number of animals did not reach the 16-week endpoint becauseofahumaneendpoint.Kidneyfunctionwasmarkedly reduced in the experiment, which has probably contributed to animals reaching the humane endpoint.As a result, the risk for type II error is relatively high.Indeed, point estimates for the calcification endpoints were all in the direction of suggestingabenefitforhighdietarymagnesium.Weincluded animals in the analysis that had completed at least 8 weeks of 1056 N.H.J.Leenders et al.
follow-up, but several had different durations of follow-up. However,thedurationoffollow-updidnotdiffersignificantly between the two dietary magnesium groups and we also analysedcalciumappositiontime,therebytakingintoaccount thevariabledurationoffollow-up.Thisanalysisdemonstrated corresponding results and therefore we do not expect that the variable duration of follow-up between the groups biased the results.The degree of calcification between animals within eachgroupwashighlyvariable.However,inthemodelusedin this study, a variable incidence of calcification is not unusual [31,37].Anotherlimitationofthisstudyisthatdetailsofmolecular mechanismsinvolvedintheprotectiveeffectsofhigherdietary magnesiumcould notbe explored beyond the phenotypingof arterialwallcellularcomponents.
Translationtothepatientlevelandimplicationsfor practice The partial nephrectomy rat model that was used in this study is an established model of CKD, including uremia and high serum phosphate, and with CKD-related complications similar to the human condition. Research with this model has demonstrated remarkable consistency between the ani- mal and human phenotypes [ 38].We therefore consider it reasonable to assume that the effects demonstrated in this study can be translated to the human condition as well.Before implementation of this dietary intervention in clinical practice, the beneficial effect of magnesium needs to be confirmed in patients.Arterial calcification is an important pathophysiological process leading to cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD and a strong predictor of mortality [39].In observational studies in patients with CKD, plasma magnesium concentrations are inversely associated with all- cause and cardiovascular mortality [ 11].
Explorative studies with magnesium-based interventions in patients with and withoutdialysishaveshownpositiveeffectsonseveralmarkers of calcification, including carotid intima-media thickness, coronaryarterycalcificationscoreandcalcificationpropensity score [18–21]. These are promising results, indicating that magnesium supplementation may indeed inhibit vascular calcification in CKD patients, identical to our animal study, and may potentially decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Futurestudiesandunansweredquestions Further clinical intervention studies in patients with CKD areneededtodeterminetheappropriateandsafedoseofmag- nesium supplementation and confirm its effects on vascular calcification and subsequent clinically relevant endpoints.In addition, in vitroandanimalstudiesmayfurtherhelptoreveal underlying mechanisms of the processes involved.
Then, a further challenge is to identify which mechanisms are key in theprotectiveroleofmagnesiumwithinthecomplexinterplay between local and systemic effects on the calcification process in vivo.SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Supplementary data are available at ndtonline.
