Individual sports and sports with high ﬁnancial pressure are particularly af- fected; however, substances are not only used to improve performance in adult-hood, but also in childhood and adoles- cent development, where targeted intake of anabolic steroids, for example, is/wasusedtochangethebodyandimproveper- formance; however, the use of these sub- stances causes a lot of damage to various organsystems. Notonlyphysical,butalso 608DieOrthopädie8·2024 psychologicalandsocialconsequencesare to be expected.Background Doping includes the use of agents, e.g.,anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) to en- hance athletic performance in the presti-gious success of medal winning athletes as part of the competition with western societies [ 8].TheGermanDemocraticRepublic(GDR) introducedthegovernmentaldopingplan14.25 with a mandatory doping program.Approximately 15,000 athletes were ex- posed to these compulsory and harm-ful procedures [ 8].
The respective sub- stances selectively increase physical per- formance but have serious somatic and psychological side eﬀects when used in high dosages and for longer times [ 5]. Doping substances were applied during adolescence in a very vulnerable period.Thiswasembeddedinatraumatizing sys-tem separating young athletes from their homes and exposing them to the harsh- nessandpotentialrecklessnessoftrainers.Substances were administered to athletes without their consent or knowledge but underdeﬁnedcontrolconditions.Because the young athletes trusted their coaches and medical teams, they took the oralmedications, had intramuscular injection and/or infusions [ 8].Some adolescent athletes trained with comparable workloads to seniors.This couldonly be compensated by taking the abovementionedsubstancesandendedin young age injuries that abruptly stopped theathleticcareer.
Thereafter,athletesdidnot receive any support or training, and moralguiltwassuggestedbyoﬃcials,be- causetheyhadlettheir“teammatesdown”[8]. Thereby, AAS use resulted in physical Abbreviations AAS Anabolic-androgenicsteroids ADHD Attentiondeﬁcit hyperactivity disorder FSH Follicle-stimulatinghormone GDR GermanDemocraticRepublic HDL High-density-lipoprotein HPA Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal IRB Institutionalreviewboard LDL Low-density-lipoprotein LH Luteinizinghormone PTSD Posttraumaticstressdisorderinjuries, secondary organic diseases, that could have an impact on the following generation, and in psychological damage such as depression, anxiety disorder, in- creased aggressiveness, and disturbanceof identity.Somaticeﬀects Theapplication ofAASresultsin, e.g., car-diac, (neuro)endocrine, hepatic and mus- culoskeletal disorders [ 48].Cardiac ef- fectsarethedevelopmentofcardiomyopa-thy, arrhythmia, and hypertension.
The enlargement of the ventricle (cardiomy- opathy) leads to reduced ejection frac-tion due to decreased contractility. For AAS users a reduction in electrical stabil- itywasdescribed[ 51]aswellasabnormal cardiac autonomic tone regulation [ 40] and abnormal ventricular repolarization[40] inducing arrhythmia.Consumption of AAS also generates dyslipidemia with increased levels of Low-Density-Lipopro-tein(LDL)andadecreaseofHigh-Density- Lipoprotein (HDL) with an increased risk of atherosclerosis [ 24].This explains fre- quent cerebrovascular and cardiac infarc- tions, especially in younger athletes.Other side eﬀects ofAAS are known to causehepatotoxicitywithcholestasis[ 60], peliosis hepatis [ 60] and hepatic cancer [23].Furthermore, neuroendocrinological disordersarerecorded.Substancesinduce changes in physical appearance such ashirsutism and gynecomastia causing psy- chologicproblemsmissingapsychosexual identity.
The reduction of pituitary secre- tionofLuteinizing Hormone(LH)and Fol- licle-StimulatingHormone (FSH) ended inasuppressionofspermatogenesis, hypog- onadismand infertility in men, andviriliz- ingeﬀects, dysregulationofmenstruationand infertility in women [ 48]. Growth hormones, such as soma- totropin (somatropin in the GDR), admin- istered in doses 10 times higher than the therapeutic dose [ 4] may cause ﬂuid retention, headache, and hypertension [4].Further undesiredeﬀects may include acromegaly, cardiomyopathy, insulin re-sistance/diabetes and renal failure as well as osteoarthritis [ 4].Erythropoetins in- crease plasma viscosity, increasing the risk of thrombosis, cardiovascular events, and stroke [ 4].Psychologicaleﬀects Psychological eﬀects of doping pertain to the athletes’ emotional regulation, with anxiety and anger often being theconsequence of low frustration tolerance [45].
Moreover, especially females tend to doubt performance, disrupted concen-tration, and somatic anxiety. Negative patterns of perfectionism were related to higher levels of cognitive anxiety and lower levels of self-conﬁdence [ 37].Eat- ing disorders and distorted body imageswere also observed [ 47].The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in athletes with a record of doping, the ﬁgures vary, butthe indication for a higher risk of psy- chopathologic manifestations inherent to doping is robust.The incidence of mood disorders (e.g., depression) was reported to be 22% in athletes [ 45] with doping compared to 10% in the general popula- tion[33].Likewise, theprevalenceratesof socialanxiety, panicdisorderandgeneral-ized anxiety disorderwere 15%, 4.5%and 7.1%, respectively, among dopedathletes [25], compared to 2.7%, 2.0% and 2.2% respectively, in the general population [33].Psychopathologic sequelae of doping during childhood and adolescence are manifold similar to posttraumatic situa-tions.
This couldsuggest that athletes are at a higher risk of posttraumatic symp- tomatology, e.g., posttraumatic stressdisorder (PTSD). Freyberger et al.[ 17] reported a prevalence of 29.9% in (state doped) GDR athletes compared to a life- time prevalence of 8% in PTSD in the general population [ 34].This supports the potential of the GDR’s doping system to have a traumatizing character.The present study aims to investigate the physical as well as the mental se- quelae of the state controlled doping in former athletes in the former GDR.We hypothesize trauma-related developmen- tal pathogenesis of the psychopathologicmanifestations, with their roots in child- hood.We therefore analyzed childhood trauma along with personality traits andpsychopathology as well asphysical com- plaints and compared those variables be- tween a groupofdopedathletes andtwo control groups non-doped athletes and sports-inactive individuals.
DieOrthopädie8·2024 609 Originalien Methods Atotalof159patientswereincludedinthe study after giving informed consent and then divided into three groups. The ﬁrstgroup (I) ( n=55) practiced competitive sportduringadolescenceandreceivedAAS in the former GDR.The second group (II)(n=50)intensivelyexercisedsportwithout taking any chemical substances and the third group(III)( n=54)didnotengage in sport.We interviewed patients who pre- sented as outpatients for an orthope- dic examination.We asked them for organic (musculoskeletal, cardiac, en-docrinological, urogynecological, tumor), social (professional and family problems) and psychological (aggression, insomnia, anxiety, depression, fatigue, substance abuse, lethargy, perfectionism) featuresof the disorders.In addition, the participants in this studyﬁlledinthe followingquestionnaireofpsychometricquestionnaires.Thestudy was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the Medical University(No.128/18).
PDS The posttraumatic stress diagnostic scale(PDS)assessessymptomsofPTSDidentify- ing potentially traumatic events [ 16]. The PDS has high internal consistency (coeﬃ-cient alpha=0.92).NeoFFI TheNeoFive-FactorInventory(NeoFFI)[ 11] assessesthe5-factormodelofpersonality using 5 subscales (neuroticism, extraver- sion, openness, agreeableness, conscien-tiousness), each rated on a 5-point Likert scale.Theso-calledbigﬁverepresentem- piricalobservationsofessentialfactorsfor personality description [ 14].TAS 20 The Toronto alexithymia scale 20 (TAS 20) measures diﬃculties describing feelings, identifying feelings and externally ori- ented thinking on a 5-point Likert scale [2] with good psychometric properties.Socialsupport The social support questionnaire assesses theperceptionandanticipation toreceive supportfromothers[ 19].Theusedversion consists of 14 items and is based on a 5- pointLikertscalewithgoodpsychometric properties.
ASI The anxiety sensitivity index (ASI) com-prises 18 items and the dimensions:somatic complaints, social concerns, and cognitive concerns. The questionnaire is a valid and reliable measure of anxietysensitivity [ 32].SOC-L9 TheSenseofCoherenceScale-Leipzigshort scale (SOC-L9) [ 39] is a 9-item version of the coherence scale.It is valid and reli- able to measure the sense of coherence.The construct comprises comprehensibil- ity, manageability, meaningfulness, and self-conﬁdencecorrelatedwithwell-being.LOT The life orientation test (LOT) [ 22]c o m - prises the subscales pessimism and opti-mismcorrelatedtopsychologicaldisorders (e.g., depression) in the general popula- tion.BDI-II TheBeck depressioninventory 2(BDI-II)isawidespreadmeasureofdepression[ 3].It is assigned goodpsychometric properties and functions as a self-rating measure.CTQ Thechildhoodtraumaquestionnaire(CTQ)assessesin the dimensionsphysical, emo- tional,andsexualabuseaswellasphysicaland emotional neglect.
It is reliable and valid for this purpose and considered the gold standard in its ﬁeld [ 35].Equality, diversityandinclusion statement Our study included all identiﬁed cases of doping that presented to our outpatientclinic as part of a specialist review. No distinctions were made between gender, age and ethnicity; however, it must bementioned that state doping in the GDR selected the cohort.The team ofauthors consistsoffemale andmalecontributorsfromtheﬁeldsofor- thopedics, psychosomatics and epidemi-ology.With respect to the analysis, care was takenwhenplanningthenumberofcasesto ensure a similar gender ratio in the control groups as in the doping group.The patient and public were not in- volved in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans of the research.Results A total of 159 persons were included in this study.The mean age of the doping group (group I, N=55) was 55.3 years, in the sportsgroup (groupII, N=50) 54.8 yearsandinthenosportsgroup(groupIII, N=54)56.4 years.
There were 30 females and 25 males in group I, 20 females and 30 males in group II, and 32 females and22 males in group III. The sports disci- plinesgroupIwasdividedintoendurance sports (N=19), weight training ( N=12), ball sport ( N=10), martial sport ( N=9) andothers(N=5).GroupIIshowedasim- ilardistributionwithendurancesport( N= 23), weight training ( N=11), ball sport (N=8), others ( N=7), only martial sport (N=1) was lower.In group I, 41 individu- als reported use of oral turinabol, 28 use of dynvital, 15 used athletovit (both sup-plements, which were mixed with mes- tanolone) and 14 disclosed to have re- ceived injections with doping substances.Oftheparticipants30claimedfurthersub- stancesortherapies, suchasmixeddrinks,powder drinks, protein and vitamin sup- plements, blood exchange and radiation therapy.
Physicalsideeﬀects The most musculoskeletal diseases re-ported in group I were spinal syndromes 610DieOrthopädie8·2024 (N=42, 76.4%), arthropathies ( N=33, 60%), osteopathies ( N=21, 38.2%) and chronic myopathies ( N=34, 61.8%). In group II, 23 (46.9%) persons complained about spinal syndromes, 20 (40.8%)about arthropathies, 6 (12.2%) about osteopathies and 5 (10.2%)aboutchronic myopathies.In group III, there was anincreased rate of spinal syndromes ( N= 26, 49.1%).The rate of arthropathies ( N= 17, 32.1%), osteopathies ( N=2, 3.8%) and myopathies ( N=5, 9.4%) were lower.In summary, the doping cohort hada signiﬁcantly higher rate of all muscu- loskeletal disorders than the no-sport group (spinal syndromes odds ratio,OR=3.4, p=0.005, arthropathies OR= 3.2,p=0.004, osteopathies OR=15.8, p<0.0005, myopathies OR=15.5, p< 0.0005).
Therewerealsosigniﬁcantdiﬀer- ences for spinal syndromes (OR=3.7, p= 0.002), osteopathies (OR=4.4, p=0.003) and myopathies (OR=14.2, p<0.0005) between the doping and the sportgroup. For other somatic disorders, we de- ﬁned cardiac, endocrinological, urogyne- cological and tumor entities.Group I hada higher rate for arrhythmia than group II (34.5% vs.8.2%, OR=5.9, p=0.002) and group III (34.5% vs.8.2%, OR=6.5, p= 0.001).Group I also had a higher proba- bilityforarterialhypertensionthangroupII(38.2%vs.17%,OR=3.0, p=0.018).Hep- atopathy was more frequent in group I (25.5%)than in groupII (4%or8.2%)andgroupIII(1%or1.9%).Therewasahigher riskforhepatopathy fordopedindividuals compared to group II (OR=3.8, p=0.036) and group III (OR=17.8, p<0.0005).Tumor diseases showed a higher risk forgroupIvs.groupII(OR=4.0, p=0.015) and group III (OR=4.3, p=0.008).With respect to the urogynecological diseases,ingroupImorecasesofdysmen- orrhea than in group II (27.3% vs.8.2%, OR=4.2,p=0.02)wereshown.
Therewere no diﬀerences for other urogynecological diseases,suchaslateageofmenarche,hor-monal imbalance, complication encoun- tered in pregnancy, abortion and urogy- necological tumor between all groups.Social and professional consequences Diﬃculties in profession, changes of pro- fession,occupationaldisabilities,sickleave>10days,notbeingabletoworkinateam showed diﬀerences between group I and other groups. No diﬀerences betweengroups were observed for extended edu- cation.Especially diﬃculties in profession increased in group I vs.group II (OR= 114.8,p<0.0005) and vs.group III (OR= 159.4,p<0.0005).Sick leave >10 days/ year was increased in group I vs.group II (OR=55.0, p<0.0005).Forpsychiatricdisorders,werecognized a higher risk for depression (OR=9.2, p< 0.0005) and sleeping disorders (OR=3.9, p=0.002) in group I vs.group II and vs.group III for depression (OR=13.7, p<0.0005), sleeping disorders (OR=3.8, p=0.001),anxietydisorder(OR=17.8, p= 0.000).

Female participantsingroupIwereatahigherrisk forthecategoriesdiﬃcultiesinprofession,changeofprofession,occupationaldisabil- ity,sickleave>10days/year,notbeingable to workinateam, and diﬃculties in close relationships.Although all these items were increased for the male participants.The risk in females was further increased for diﬃculties in profession (males OR= 287.5 vs.females OR=90.0, p<0.0005), sickleave>10days/year(malesOR=40.1 vs.females OR=12.3, p<0.0005)and not being able to work in a team (males OR= 46.2,p<0.0005 vs.females OR=5.1, p= 0.012).Signiﬁcant increases in females in group I for musculoskeletal diseases (spinal syndromes OR=4.0, p=0.010, arthropathies OR=2.9, p=0.035, os- teopathiesOR=6.9, p=0.002,myopathies OR=16.2, p<0.0005) were observed which were not found for male individu- als.Diseases such as arrhythmias were found to be increased in both males and females.
Furthermore, an increased riskof liver disease was found in males (OR= 16.0,p<0.0005),whereas no signiﬁcance could even be found in females. In fe- males, there was a diﬀerence between group I and the others for dysmenorrhea(OR=3.0, P=0.030) and late menarche (OR=5.1, p=0.012).Here, only females showed increased rates of depression in group I and the other groups (OR=5.0, p=0.002).Whereasformalesthesediﬀer- enceswereobservedforsleepdisturbance, aggression, anxiety disorder and depres- sion.Depressionshowedanincreasedriskin comparison to the female participants (male OR=52.1, p<0.0005 vs.female OR 5.0,p=0.002).Males also showed increased risk for tumors in group I (OR= 9.5,p =0.005) and pediatric diseases, e.g.orthopedic, autoimmune, dermatologic, psychological, endocrinological (OR=4.2, p=0.029).There were no diﬀerences between group II and group III but for arterial hypertension (OR=2.2, p=0.043).
Psychologicaleﬀects Ingroup I individuals claimed more child- hood emotional and physical neglect, tobelessoptimisticandmorepessimistic,to perceive less social support and to be far more depressive than the other groups.Moreover, group I displayed less extraver- sion and more neuroticism. Additionally, the history of doping was linked to anxi- etysensitivitywithrespecttoallsubscales ( .Table1).RegardingtheA1traumas(apersonwas exposedtoactualorthreateneddeath,se- riousinjury,sexualviolence),nosigniﬁcantresults showed for the experience of an accident(χ 2=2.0,p=0.4),violencewithin families (χ2=4.17,p=0.1), sexual abuse within family ( χ2=0.17,p=0.09),or com- bat (χ2=2.94,p=0.3) and imprisonment (χ2=1.88,p=0.4); however, attacks by astrangerandsexualassaultbyastranger were morefrequentingroupI( .Table2).The PTSD only occurred in group I ( n=3) butwasnotsigniﬁcantcomparedtoother groups ( .Table2).
Using binary regression analysis (.Table3), we aimed to delineate the closestrelationofthepsychiatricvariables associated with doping to that category. The respective predictors were the sub-scale identifying feelings of the TAS-20 (p=0.000), the sense of coherence and the BDI-II ( p=0.002) as well as the BDI (p=0.02).

After>30years,lateeﬀectsofAASshowuponphysicalandpsychosocial levels. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to compare the long-term eﬀects of systematic doping during adolescence.Our results analyze the risk for the abovementioned organic and structuraldamage after anabolic abuse in competi- tive sports.With a threefold (dopedvs.non-sport) and a fourfold (doped vs.sport), respec- tively, increased risk for spinal syndromesandarthropathies,ourdatashowaslightly higher risk compared to a study by Horn et al.[28] in football players after profes- sional career with a 2-fold increased risk after AAS use.Osteopathies and myopathies showed an increased risk to occur after doping, which can explained by a change in thecollagenstructure[ 12]andchangesinten- don elasticity [ 42].Bradytrophic tissues, suchastendonscannotcompensateforthesteroid-induced force increase [ 13].
Dif- ferences in arthropathies were not found betweendopingandsportsgroups,which may be due to increased training inten- sity with a general damage to articularcartilage in competitive athletes. Themostcommonlyobservedarrhyth- mias occurring in athletes are atrial ﬁb-rillation, ventricular ﬁbrillation, ventricu- lar tachycardia, and supraventricular and ventricularectopy[ 27].Cardiomyopathies were frequently observedinother studies after AAS use which we did not observe in our cohort.This eﬀect occurs during or shortly after a competitive sports career or AAS use.Over time, the myocardiumadaptstothenewconditionsafterareduc- tion of the load [ 46].Thereby, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy may be evi-dent years after discontinuation of AAS; however, ventricular hypertrophy is con- sideredtobecausedbyexcessivetraining and not only by AAS abuse [ 57].Theliverdysfunctionhasasigniﬁcantly increased riskinourstudy.

Binding tothereceptorinitiates acascadethat ultimately leads to altered gene ex- pression [ 20]. In the doping group, there wasafourfoldincreasedriskoftumorsandmale athletes had a further increase.Why femaledopedathletes have neither anin- creased risk for liver dysfunction nor for tumor diseases remains unexplained and requiresfurtherstudiesanalyzing gender-speciﬁc eﬀects.Urogynecological complications, such asdysmenorrheaandlateonsetofmenar-che can be explained by the intervention inthefemalehormonalbalance.Otheref- fects include hirsutism, irreversible deep- ening of voice, secondary amenorrhea, anovulation,andultimatelyinfertility[ 59].The group of doped competitive ath- letesdiﬀerinfamilyandwork-relatedprob- lems from those of athletes and non-ath- letes.Diﬃculties at work are frequentlyreported.
Many former athletes with AAS have a disruptive professional career with extended time of education, unemploy-ment,aswellasfrequentretrainingleading to occupational disability due to physical and psychological disorders. Family situa- tions are also characterized by diﬃculties in partnerships.The reduced adaptabil-ity is often pronounced and not being able to work in a team is also described.Diﬀerences in gender could be linked todiversepsychologicalpathologies,suchas depression, anxiety disorders, aggression, sleeping disorders, and non-team ability.Males show a 46-fold increased risk com- pared to the female athletes with a 5-fold increased risk.In female athletes, onlydepressionwasfoundto beasigniﬁ- cantpsychologicaldisorder.Extendedsickleave (sick days >10/year) was found for maleathletes, whereas regarding occupa- tional disability the female doping groupagain showed an increased risk.
This may suggest that former female athletes with AAS use are less likely to call in sick, but thereby exceed their physical and mental capacity. This was already crucial duringtheir athletic career, and therefore they might be more likely to suﬀer from occu- pational disability as they no longer haveany further compensatory mechanisms.The consequences of state-controlled doping were investigated with respect tothehistoryofchildhoodtrauma,PTSD,and current psychopathology.As prior ﬁnd- ings on the eﬀects of doping, we found anincreasedburdenofpessimismandde- pression, along with a decreased comfortthroughsocialsupportandaweakersense ofcoherence; however, depressionturned outtobethepsychologicalsymptommostclosely linked to the doping experience.Moreinterestingly,onthepersonalitylevel this study reveals a relationship between theexperienceofstate-drivendopingand alexythymia, the sense of coherence andchildhood trauma.
Thedopedcohortdisplayedmorediﬃ- cultyidentifyingfeelings(i.e.,alexithymia),more neuroticism and less extraversion, as well as higher levels of anxiety sen- sitivity and a weakened sense of coher- ence. The experiences of physical and emotional neglect in childhood were sig-niﬁcantly more pronounced in the doped than in the remaining categories.As to PTSD, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence showed,although the respective A1 criterion (i.e., havingexperienced acertaintrauma)was clearlylinkedtothehistoryofdopingwith the traumas indicated being of interper- DieOrthopädie8·2024 613 Originalien sonal kinds, namely physical and sexual oﬀence by nonmembers of the family.
Hence, our results add to the litera- ture proposing the link between doping experiences and psychological disorders.Yet, this study develops a more compre- hensivepictureasthedevelopmentalper- spective is reconstructed suggesting thatthe vulnerability for the later distress is conveyed by childhood trauma, which is alsoreﬂectedinthedisclosureoftype1in- terpersonal and sexual traumas by doped individuals and mediated by alexithymictraits as well as the sense of coherence and poor social support. Prior trauma, especially in childhood is known to belinkedtoadultalexithymia[ 55]aswellasto adult psychopathology [ 58].Alexithymia represents a relatively stable personality style including the reduced ability to re- alize, identify and express one’s emotions[54].The deﬁcient interpersonal recog- nition and communication of emotional states may lead to rejection by the so-cial counterpart, which has at least been showninpsychotherapy[ 44].
Thepsycho- logical disposition of alexithymia is alsolinked to physical disease, such as hy- pertension [ 10], intensity of chronic pain [41], heart rate regulation [ 6], dysmenor- rhea [15], myopathy [ 1] and hepatopathy [9]. This pattern of clinical associations is represented in the doping group of our study.The mechanism behind these as- sociations has been described as highersymptom reporting and perception, som- atization as well as a tendency towards unhealthy lifestyles[ 9].Consideringthese implicationsofalexithymia, itsassociation withchildhoodtraumaisperspicuous,be-causechildhoodtraumaislinkedtoseveral physicalconditions,suchasbackpain[ 38], arthritis [18]a n dm y o p a t h y[ 18].However, the connection between childhood trauma and arrhythmias, hy- pertension, and hepatopathy has not been reported previously.
Dysmenorrhea was also more frequent in the dopedindividuals, although this may not be a posttraumatic eﬀect [ 29]; however, age at menarche is reﬂective of childhoodtrauma [7] and was linked to doping in the present study. Most athletes start sport in childhood oradolescence[ 53],wheretheymayexpe- rienceinjuryand competition.Suchstres-sorsmay precipitate psychiatric disorders, especially depression, anxiety and atten- tion deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [53];however,depressionwhichwefound tobethemostlikelysymptomintheafter-math ofdoping, isnot overrepresented in elite athletes [ 53], suggesting our ﬁnding to be caused by the doping experiencerather than by the athletic status itself.Apart from psychological sequelae, such as alexithymia, doping is linked to bodily changesinwomenandmen,which,when encountered in childhood and/or adoles-cence,maycriticallyinterferewiththecon- solidation of identity and with the matu- ration of the psyche.
Eﬀects are acne, hir-sutism, amenorrhea in females, as well as lossoflibidoandgynecomastiainmales,or hospitalization because of e.g. liver dam- ageindependently ofthe athlete’s gender [52 ].The present study revealed lower lev- els of the sense of coherence in doped athletes, which may reﬂect the destabiliz-inginﬂuenceofthedopingexperienceon thebehavioral,cognitiveandmotivational resistance [ 43].The sense of coherence (SOC) comprises opinion forming, which isaconstitutingelementofresilience, and typically hampered by posttraumatic ex- periences [ 50].Thus, reduced SOC may be an important factor within the cas-cade of physical, psychic and psychoso- matic changes which labilize the formerly doped individuals of the present study.Apart from the harmful eﬀects of ex- cessive training, the role of interpersonal trauma must be considered.
In this study, 32% of the participants with an experi- ence of state-driven doping reported theexperience of an interpersonal assault by a stranger (i.e., not a member of the fam- ily)and13.2%reportedasexualassaultbyastranger, comparing to 4.9%in the gen- eralpopulation[ 36]. Thisﬁndingindicates that the trauma is associated with dop- ing,andthatthoseconditionseﬀectuated a lack of emotional care and attention.In addition, Johnson et al.[ 30]r e p o r t e d the prediction of restricted cardiovascular health by childhood neglect, suggestingapathwayfromchildhoodtraumatoheart disease,aﬁndingpossiblyreﬂected inthe present results.Thataside,thetoxicityofdopingagents ofcoursemaycontribute directlytophys-ical restriction and disease.The cardio- vascular system, for example, is believed to suﬀer damage through atherosclerosis, thrombosis, vasospasm or direct injury of the endothelium [ 26].
Apart from such deleterious eﬀects on the cardiac system, AAS induce a variety of hormonal dys- balances to the eﬀect of a systematicallycompromised gender-related health. The hormonal cascade of the Hypothalamic- Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and the ovar- ianfunctionlosetheirbalanceandsetthe stage for virilization and organ dysfunc-tion.Trainingitself,however, mayhavean eﬀectonthehormonalregulationandthe onset of puberty [ 31].The ﬁnding [ 7]o f a dose-dependent inﬂuence of childhood abuse, however, on the age at menarche, correspondswelltothe presentﬁndingof childhood trauma in the doped cohort.Hence [5], there are risks beyond be- ing caught that come along with dop- ing.Awarenessforthehazardouspotential shouldberaisedamongathletesandtheirtrainers as well, who represent an impor- tant inﬂuence and source of information for athletes and, at the same time, mightbe at risk of damaging their fosterlings.
Despite its piloting character, the present study has a few caveats, as it is cross-sectional and retrospective in na- ture, and relies on a restricted sample;however, the cohorts of this study may serve as an admonishing example to ath- letes and sports oﬃcials in present andfuture times.
