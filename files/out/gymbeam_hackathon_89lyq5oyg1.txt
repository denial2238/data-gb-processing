Methods: Nine adults were selected to participate in a comparative study of gait assessment outcomes using an IMU sensor-based wearable system, a gold-standard motion capture system, and a pressure-based gait analysis system.The subject walked on a path that incorporated all three systems. Data analysis was performed on spatiotemporal gaitparameters, including velocity, cycle time, cadence, and stride length.This was followed by gait phases, includingstance, swing, double stance, and single limb support phases.Data were processed using the data processing soft-ware of each system.An independent sample t-test was conducted for inter-group comparison to analyze the data.Results: The spatiotemporal gait parameters of the systems demonstrated excellent consistency, and the gait phases showed high consistency.Compared to the gold-standard pressure-based gait analysis system (the GATERite system), the mean gait cycle time results were 1.124 s vs.
1.127 s ( p=0.404); cadence was 93.333 steps/min vs. 94.189 steps/min ( p=0.482); stance phase was 60.89% vs.63.26% ( p<0.001); swing phase was 39.11% vs.36.74% (p<0.001); stride length was 1.404 m vs.1.420 m ( p=0.743); speed was 1.093 m/s vs.1.110 m/s ( p=0.725).Compared to the gold-standard video-based motion capture system, the root mean square error was 2.7/C14for the hip angle and 2.6/C14for the knee angle.Conclusions: This IMU-based wearable system delivered precise measuring results to evaluate patients with knee OA.This technology can also be used to guide rehabilitation exercises for patients with knee OA.Key words: Gait Analysis; Knee; Osteoarthritis; Remote Monitor Introduction Knee osteoarthritis (OA), a joint disorder marked by the deterioration of cartilage, is common, particularly in older people.1With an increasing elderly population, the incidence of knee OA has increased dramatically.
Accordingto previous research, one-third of people over 60 years old inChina will be affected by knee OA. 2,3Furthermore, abnormal gait and restricted function are clinical manifestations of knee OA.Delayed diagnosis and intervention will lead toreduced mobility and lower quality of life.Advanced OA patients require total knee arthroplasty, placing a hefty ﬁnan- cial strain on individuals and the healthcare system.4 There are several limitations to current screening and monitoring technologies for knee OA.Due to China ’sl a r g e patient population and limited resources, most patients do notreceive adequate early screening.5Additionally, elderly patients with limited mobility face increased dif ﬁculties traveling to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment.

questionnaire to screen the kne e functionality of adults over 40 years old in the community for the rapid diagnosis of knee OA.6Although questionnaires lack objective measures of knee function and gait abnormalities, early screening can helppatients become aware of their condition. This can lead to ear- lier intervention and slow joint degeneration.Early screening and evaluati on of knee OA are essential to prevent the exacerbation of symptoms.Currently, no singlescreening and evaluation modality can be scaled to largepopulations.Medical imaging requires expensive machinery, and the interpretation of results is highly dependent on practi- tioners ’experience.Three-dimensional motion capture devices and plantar pressure devices (e.g., video-based motion captureand pressure-based gait analysis systems) are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and inef ﬁcient to use.
In addition, the abovementioned modalities cannot remotely measure and transmit data; patients must visit a hospital for assessment, which decreases compliance. 7With the development of wear- able sensors and arti ﬁcial intelligence, remote assessment tools have been used for early screening.Wearable sensors are usefulfor remotely monitoring diseases in the community and homesettings.Previous studies used video calls to monitor olderadults ’physical activity.8Other studies have also used smart phones ’acceleration sensors to assess gait.9However, these sensors lack comprehensive measurement data and exhibitlower precision and accuracy.Technology will not onlyimprove the screening ef ﬁciency of patients but also distribute uneven medical resources and alleviate the shortage of clinicalstaff.This study designed a remote assessment system basedon inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to assess impair- ment of the lower extremities.
An IMU is a device that inte- grates accelerometers, gyros copes, and magnetometers to measure and track the acceleratio n, angular velocity, and orien- tation of objects. The objective of this study is to validate theaccuracy of the IMU sensor-based wearable system (wearablesystem) for gait assessment in patients with knee OA by com- paring it with two gold-standard gait analysis systems.Materials and Methods Materials The materials used include the wearable system (JiakangZhongzhi Technology, China), a pressure-based gait analysissystem (GAITRite, CIR Systems, USA), the Vicon video- based motion capture system (Vicon, OML, UK), and SPSS software (IBM, USA).The GAITRite electronic path com-prises pressure-activated sensors.Vicon ’s optical motion cap- ture system includes eight cameras.The wearable systemconsists of data acquisition sensors, a mobile application, acloud server, and a physician portal (Figure 1).
Algorithms were used to calculate gait parameters and lower extremity range of motion (ROM), and the results were transmitted toa cloud server. The main purpose of the mobile app isto obtain data and analyze ROM and gait.Measurement dataand patient information are saved and sent to the cloudserver.The physician portal retrieves patient assessment data from a cloud server and evaluates the patient ’s condition.Methods This study was approved by Beijing Jishuitan Hospital ’s ethics committee (Ethics Committee of Beijing Jishuitan Hospital with Approval Number 202107 –26.).The inclu- sion criteria for patients were: (i) ful ﬁlling the diagnostic criteria for knee OA as proposed by the Orthopedic Branchof the Chinese Medical Associa tion; (ii) aged 60 years or above; (iii) being classi ﬁed between grade I and grade III of knee OA based on X-ray imaging examination; and (iv) being willing to voluntarily participate in this experi- ment and provide a signed informed consent form.
Theexclusion criteria were (i) patients with impaired cognitivefunction and (ii) those suffering from other musculoskeletalor neurological diseases. Nine subjects ( ﬁve men and four women) aged 61 –73 years (mean age: 65.6 /C62.8 years; mean disease duration: 1.1 /C61.6 years) were enrolled in this experiment.All patients had a K –L classi ﬁcation of grade II or less.We collected informed consent from allparticipants.The experiment was conducted in a con ﬁned space, with participants traversing from one end to the other alonga stretch of footpath measuring 8 m in length.A pressure- based gait analysis system was installed.At the same time, the video-based motion capture system was set up.Weplaced three IMU sensors on the patient ’s anterior mid- thigh, anterior tibial region, and dorsum of the foot andrecorded their walk (Figure 2).In a room, we placed the GAITRite system on 10 m of walkway.The Vicon system was set up in the same room.
Subjects stood still for 3 s at the starting point to calibrate the GAITRite system, theVicon system, and the wearable system. Afterward, the sub-ject walked at a comfortable speed, and all three systemsmeasured the subject ’s walking simultaneously, stopping at the end of the walkway.Data Analysis Data was processed using each system ’s data processing software.The data collected included spatiotemporalparameters and joint mobility parameters, and representa-tive points from the gait cycle were selected for analysis(Figure 3) .C y c l et i m ei st h et i m er e q u i r e dt oc o m p l e t ea single walking cycle, which refers to the time from when one leg steps forward and the foot follows to when theheel touches the ground again.Cadence is de ﬁned as the number of times two legs alternate within a minute.Stridelength is the distance between two heel strikes in meters.Speed is the distance per unit of time in meters per sec- ond.
During the stance phase, the foot is in contact with the ground, expressed as a percentage of the cycle. Mean-while, the swing phase is when the foot is off the ground,also expressed as a percentage of the cycle.Knee ROM isthe angle of knee ﬂexion during walking in degrees.Hip2912 ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY VOLUME 15NUMBER 11NOVEMBER , 2023KNEEOSTEOARTHRITIS ;REMOTE MONITOR ;GAITANALYSIS    A B C FIGURE 1 (A) The wearable system and included software; (B) the GAITRite system; and (C) the Vicon system.IMU, inertial measurement unit.2913 ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY VOLUME 15NUMBER 11NOVEMBER , 2023KNEEOSTEOARTHRITIS ;REMOTE MONITOR ;GAITANALYSIS ROM is the angle at which the hip moves during walking in degrees.Negative values of the hip angle represent theposterior extension of the hip joint.This study aims to investigate the following parame- ters: cycle time, cadence, stance phase, swing phase, stridelength, speed, angle of the knee, and angle of the hip.
Statistical Analysis We used IBM SPSS software (IBM Corporation, USA) to analyze the data analysis and independent sample t-tests for inter-group comparison. A p-value of ≤0.05 indicates statisti- cal signi ﬁcance, whereas a p-value ≤0.01 indicates a statistically signi ﬁcant difference.Results Motion Parameter Results Figure 4shows the different results of the wearable system and gait analysis system for each step, including basic spatio-temporal parameters and phase parameters.Lower extremityROM is also compared between the wearable and the motioncapture systems.Temporal Parameters of Gait The results indicate that the basic spatiotemporal parameterscollected by the wearable system are similar to those for thegait analysis system (cycle time, 1.124 s vs.1.127 s,p=0.404; cadence, 93.333 step/min vs.94.189 step/min, p=0.482; stride length, 1.404 m vs.1.420 m, p=0.743; speed, 1.093 M/s vs.1.110 M/s, p=0.725).
However, there are some differences in the results of the phase parametersbetween the two systems (stance phase, 60.89% vs. 63.26%,p< 0.001; swing phase, 39.11% vs.36.74%, p< 0.001) (Table 1).Range of Motion Wearable systems can accurately measure joint ROM.Usingthe motion capture system as a reference, the root meansquare error (RMSE) is 2.7 /C14for the hip and 2.6/C14for the knee (Table 2).Discussion This study compared the spatiotemporal gait parameters between a wearable system, a gait analysis system, and a motion capture system.The experimental results demon- strated a high degree of consistency between the wearable system and the gait analysis system in speed, cycle time,cadence, and stride length.It con ﬁrmed the accuracy of the wearable system for monitoring gait.
However, the measure-ments of the gait phase, including the percentage of time FIGURE 2 Wearing con ﬁguration of inertial measurement unit sensors FIGURE 3 Diagram demonstrating a gait cycle.2914 ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY VOLUME 15NUMBER 11NOVEMBER , 2023KNEEOSTEOARTHRITIS ;REMOTE MONITOR ;GAITANALYSIS spent in the swing phase and stance phase, exhibited slight differences. Precision of Measurement Gait phase variations are due to the slightly different initial heel strike and ﬁnal toe off measurements.In the gait analy- sis and the motion capture systems, precision is affected byspatiotemporal resolutions.Therefore, different systemsexhibited slightly different measurements.Previous studieshave shown that the principles of measuring spatiotemporal parameters are consistent across different systems bydetecting the timing of two consecutive heel strikes.We haveshown that the IMU sensor-based wearable system is also consistent in measuring gait parameters.
Furthermore, the wearable system and motion capture system showed excellent consistency for lower extremityROM. This demonstrated that the wearable system couldaccurately monitor changes in hip and knee angles during FIGURE 4 Blue color represents the wearable system, and gray color represents the GAITRite system.By comparing the data from both systems, the accuracy can be observed.2915 ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY VOLUME 15NUMBER 11NOVEMBER , 2023KNEEOSTEOARTHRITIS ;REMOTE MONITOR ;GAITANALYSIS walking.10Previous studies have shown that the IMU can accurately evaluate knee ROM with a low RMSE of 3.0 to4.8 /C14.11This study demonstrated that the wearable system had a low RMSE of 2.6/C14during walking.We have shown that the IMU-based system is accurate and automated.In the future, itwill improve the ef ﬁciency of the clinical work ﬂow and enable the remote evaluation of lower extremity functions.
12–14 Clinical Implications The wearable system is not limited by environmental condi- tions, and it provides a reliable and convenient way to evalu-ate knee function. It can detect problems such as limitationsofﬂexion –extension and gait changes due to early OA.The wearable system is consistent with the results of gold-standardmeasurement, and it is more convenient than previous technol- ogies.For example, the subject does not need to wear markers, and the subject is not limited to a physical walkway.Thissystem is also useful for assessing postoperative rehabilitationprogress following total knee arthroplasty.Advantages and Disadvantages As previously mentioned, the wearable system enablesaccurate assessment of knee function compared to the gold-standard video-based motion capture and plantar pressure systems.First, the wearable system is cost-effective compared to traditional large-scale motion capture and plantar pressuresystems.
Second, the wearable system is easy to operate, it can be turned on in a few simple steps, and it is suitable forthe elderly population. The subject simply wears the sensoron the limb, turns on the power, and connects to thesoftware via Bluetooth to measure the joint angle and gaitpattern.The system ’s measurement data is analyzed using an artiﬁcial intelligence algorithm to generate the assessment results.Finally, this system does not have environmentalrestrictions; it can be used outdoors and in poor lighting.Incomparison, the motion capture and pressure-based gaitanalysis systems ’operational steps are more tedious and require the placement of large equipment.Thus, wearablesystems are advantageous in clinical settings.However, the wearable system has several limitations.This study used an inertial measurement unit for joint angleand gait measurements.The gyroscope may produce drifterrors during long periods of use.
15An algorithm was added to the analysis software to reduce the effects of drift errors.The wearable system may also be affected by the incorrect placement of sensors. To account for this error, we provided a tutorial on sensor placement and suggested tightening theelastic band around the limb to prevent a large error duringwalking.Additionally, we utilized a calibration algorithm toprevent errors from sensor shifts.Limitations and Strengths There are certain limitations to this study.We only com-pared the angle in the right leg to the video-basedm o t i o nc a p t u r es y s t e mt oe n s u r et h ev i s i b i l i t yo ft h et a r - get joint.16Future experiments could capture and com- pare data from both legs.Additionally, our study had alimited sample size; future research could include largersample sizes and individuals with pathological gaits toassess gait asymmetry.
The advantage of this paper lies in the gait of knee OA being measured by multiple systems simultaneously, includ- ing the gold-standard Vicon system for gait assessment. Thisgreatly improves the reliability of the evaluation results.Fur-thermore, the simultaneous measurement of multiple sys-tems greatly reduces the measurement error.TABLE 1 Comparison of gait parameters Wearable system, Mean (SD) Gait analysis system, Mean (SD) Interaction pvalue Mean difference (95% CI) Cycle time (s) 1.124 (0.013) 1.127 (0.015) 0.404 0.016 (0.004,0.028) Cadence (steps/min) 93.333 (2.449) 94.189 (2.304) 0.482 0.046 (0.008,0.012) Stride length (m) 1.404 (0.038) 1.420 (0.027) 0.743 /C00.02 ( /C00.13, 0.09) Speed (m/s) 1.093 (0.096) 1.110 (0.090) 0.725 0.126 (0.03,0.222)Stance phase (% cycle time) 60.89 (1.100) 63.26 (0.724) <0.001 3.43 (2.56, 4.3)Swing phase (% cycle time) 39.11 (1.100) 36.74 (0.724) <0.001 2.95 (2.66,3.24) Abbreviations: CI, con ﬁdence interval; SD, standard deviation.
