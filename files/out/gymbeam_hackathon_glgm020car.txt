Here, we show that fasting affects retinoid mobilization in a tissue-speci ﬁc manner, and that hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adi- pose tissue is required to maintain serum concentrations of retinol and RBP4 during fasting in mice. We found that extracellularretinol-free apo-RBP4 induces retinol release by adipocytes in an HSL-dependent manner.Consistently, global or adipocyte-speci ﬁc HSL de ﬁciency leads to an accumulation of retinoids in adipose tissue and a drop of serum retinol and RBP4 during fasting, which affects retinoid-responsive gene expression in eye and kidney and lowers renal retinoid content.These ﬁndings establish a novel crosstalk between liver and adipose tissue retinoid stores for the maintenance of systemic vitamin A homeostasis during fasting.

In the eye, 11- cisretinaldehyde is the light-sensitivechromophore of the rhodopsin complex and required for the visual cycle in the retina (Palczewski et al, 2000 ).All- trans retinoic acid (atRA) and its derivatives regulate reproduction, embryonic development, immune cell function, and cell proliferation anddifferentiation (Blaner, 2007 ; Blaner et al, 1999 ; Morriss-Kay and Sokolova, 1996 ;N a p o l i , 1996 ) as activating ligands for nuclear retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors (RAR and RXR) (Heymanet al, 1992 ; Levin et al, 1992 ; Petkovich et al, 1987 ;R ü h le ta l , 2015 ).
All vitamin A in the body derives from nutritional ingestion of carotenoid precursors or retinoid s, in case of the latter transported and delivered via lipoproteins/chylomicrons and the action of membrane-bound lipoprotein lipase (Quadro et al, 2004 ; von Lintig et al, 2020 ). Vitamin A stores are formed by the esteri ﬁcation of retinol with fatty acids and its storage in organs like liver and adipose tissue, with liver-reside nt stellate cells containing the majority of retinyl ester stores of the body.The mobilization ofretinyl esters requires their hydrolytic cleavage and several lipases have been implicated in the hydrolysis of retinyl esters (Grumet et al, 2016 ; Schreiber et al, 2012 ).The rate-limiting enzyme in liver is unknown, however, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is the major retinyl ester hydrolase (REH) in adipose tissue (Strom et al, 2009 ).
Hepatic mobilization of retinol and its transport in the circulation is facilitated by retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4, also known as RBP), the speci ﬁc transport protein of retinol in the blood (Kanai et al, 1968 ). Upon loading of RBP4 with retinol within the hepatocyte, a complex is formed with transthyretin (TTR) prior secretion (Bellovino et al, 1996 ;M o n a c oe ta l , 1995 ;N a y l o ra n d Newcomer, 1999 ).In the circulation, retinol-loaded holo-RBP4 binds its membrane receptors “stimulated by retinoic acid 6 ” (STRA6) and STRA6-like (STRA6L, also referred to as RBP receptor 2) for delivery of retinol to target cells (Alapatt et al, 2013 ; Kawaguchi et al, 2011 ).Moreover, STRA6 also mediates retinol efﬂux to apo-RBP4 and retinol exchange to replenish cellular retinoids (Kawaguchi et al, 2012 ), underlining the dynamics of retinol transport and distributio n to warrant retinoid homeostasis.

Retinal function and visual acuity are impaired during early life in these mice,normalizing after 4 –5 months when fed a vitamin A-suf ﬁcient diet (Quadro et al, 1999 ).In fact, although expressed in many tissues and cell types, RBP4 in the circul ation is entirely hepatocyte- derived, since it is undetectable in the serum of mice with hepatocyte-speci ﬁc deletion of the gene (Thompson et al, 2017 ).Accordingly, when overexpressed in hepatocytes, RBP4 is readilysecreted and increases circulatin g retinol levels while depleting hepatic retinyl esters (Muenzner et al, 2013 ; Steinhoff et al, 2022b ).
In C57BL/6 mice, serum concentrations of retinol are kept constant at ~0.5 –1.5 µM, even in stress situations such as prolonged nutritional vitamin A de ﬁciency that deplete hepatic retinyl ester stores before affecting serum retinol concentrations (Gao et al,2019 ; Liu and Gudas, 2005 ). The regulation of hepatic retinol mobilization and how it coordinates with peripheral retinoid stores such as those in adipose tissue is unexplored.In this study, we asked whether prolonged fasting affects retinol mobilization from liver and hypothesized that the absence of vitamin A ingestion would be comp ensated by increased hepatic mobilization.To our surprise, we found that 24 h of fasting in mice did not deplete hepatic retinyl ester stores, but resulted in reduced REH activity accompanied by an accumulation of RBP4 protein inliver, suggesting lower hepatic retinol mobilization.In contrast, retinoid content of adipose tissue declined, maintaining serum retinol and RBP4 at steady-state levels.
Mobilization of adiposetissue retinoids was dependent on HSL, because mice with global or adipocyte-speci ﬁc deletion of HSL failed to maintain serum retinol and RBP4 levels during fasting. Lower retinol and RBP4 in thecirculation associated with altered expression of atRA-responsive genes in the eye and kidney and reduced renal retinoid content.These ﬁndings reveal an unappreciated crosstalk between liver and adipose tissue retinoid stores, va stly extending our understanding of retinoid homeostasis and HSL-dependent pathologies.Results Fasting induces RBP4 and lowers TTR in liver In order to investigate the effects of nutrient deprivation on hepatic retinol mobilization, male C57BL/6 J mice were fed ad libitum or fasted for 24 h starting at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 8 (Fig.1A).Fasted mice showed the expected drop in blood glucose and elevation inserum NEFA levels (Fig.1B), validating the experimental setup.We found that serum retinol was not affected by 24 h of fasting (Fig.1C).
Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1), rate limiting for hepatic gluconeogenesis, displayed the expected upregulation. Interestingly, mRNA expression of Rbp4 was induced whereas that of Ttrwas downregulated (Fig.1D).Hepatic REH activity, providing retinol for RBP4 loading andsubsequent complex formation with TTR, was analyzed ex vivo using liver lysates (1000 × gsupernatant) and showed a decrease in fasted mice (Fig.1E).We next determined abundance of RBP4 and TTR protein in liver and detected a robust increase in RBP4, exceeding its increase in mRNA, and a concomitant reduction in TTR (Fig.1F,G).For correct analysis, protein extracts needed to be boiled for 20 min to fully denature notoriously stable TTRcomplexes, and serum TTR was used to identify the corresponding protein band in liver extracts (Appe ndix Fig.S1).
Increased hepatic RBP4 protein was not irreversible and due to liver damage upon prolonged fasting since subsequent refeeding for 18 h completelyreversed this effect (Fig. EV1A –D).Thus, while serum retinol levels remain constant, hepatic RBP4 increases whereas TTR is down- regulated after prolonged fasting.These ﬁndings, in the context of the observed reduction in REH act ivity, point towards an overall lower hepatic retinol mobilization and RBP4 secretion upon fasting, leading to an accumulation of RBP4 protein in the liver.Fasting does not affect total RBP4 but reduces TTR and slightly increases apo-RBP4 in the circulation Consistent with unchanged serum retinol, circulating levels of RBP4 remained unaltered in fasted mice (Fig.2A,C).Serum TTR was reduced (Fig.2A,C), as reported previously for fasted rats (Wade et al, 1988 ).Detergent-free native immunoblotting of serum Figure 1.Fasting induces RBP4 and lowers TTR in the liver.

Expression and secretion of RBP4 in primary hepatocytes is regulated by cAMP and FOXO1 We took advantage of primary mouse hepatocytes to dissect the fasting-dependent regulation of RBP4 expression and secretion.Pharmacological activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α(PPAR α), a nuclear receptor known to translate hepatic NEFA in ﬂux derived from adipose tissue into hepatic gene expression during fasting (Fougerat et al, 2022 ; Kersten et al,1999 ;R e g n i e re ta l , 2018 ), induced mRNA expression of the canonical PPAR-target and fasting-induced gene Retinol Saturase (RetSat )( W e b e re ta l , 2020 ), but not that of Rbp4 (Fig. 3A).Consistent with a PPAR α-independent mechanism, liver Rbp4 mRNA expression remains fasting inducible in mice that lacked PPAR αin hepatocytes (Smati et al, 2020 ).
Also atRA, increasing the expression of the RAR target “cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily Am e m b e r1 ”(Cyp26a1 ) in a concentration-dependent manner, had no effect on Rbp4 expression (Fig. 3B) or its secretion in primary hepatocytes (Fig.EV2A,B).In conjunction with PPAR α, activation of glucocorticoid receptor via increased corticosterone in mice (Schupp et al, 2013 ) and increased cAMP signaling (Altarejos and Montminy, 2011 ) shape the hepatic response to fasting.Combined incubation with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexa- methasone (Dex) and the stable cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMPpotently induced Pck1, but also increased expression of Rbp4 (Fig.3C).Of both pathways, exposure to the cAMP analogue was sufﬁcient to achieve full inducibility of Rbp4 ,b u tn o to f Pck1 mRNA, suggesting that cAMP signaling alone mediates the upregulation of Rbp4 (Fig.3C).
Notably, basal Rbp4 expression in primary hepatocytes remains very high when compared to liver andalso compared to Pck1, whose transcript levels drop signi ﬁcantly after hepatocyte isolation and acc ounting for the high inducibility ofPck1 in vitro by hormonal stimulation due to its low basal expression. Hepatocyte cAMP is r egulated downstream of glucagon receptor signaling and, indeed, glucagon exposure induced both Pck1 and Rbp4 mRNA expression (Fig.3D).These ﬁndings are in accordance with earlier reports, demonstrating cAMP-dependent upregulation of Rbp4 in murine hepatoma cells and elevated Rbp4 expression in mouse liver upon glu cagon injection (Bianconcini et al, 2009 ; Jessen and Satre, 1998 ).Whether cAMP affects RBP4 secretion by hepatocytes has not been reported and was investigated next.
Surprisingly, despite the fact that 8-Br-cAMP induced Rbp4 mRNA expression, cellular RBP4 protein content was unaltered while it was dramatically decreased in conditioned media of hepatocytes (Fig. 3E,F).An accumulation of cellular RBP4 protein upon 8-Br-cAMP treatment, however, was observed in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor (Fig.EV2C,D), indicating that higher amounts of RBP4 protein in primary hepatocytes aretargeted by proteasomal degradation.We conclude that the fasting- associated increase in the liver Rbp4 mRNA expression is likely due to glucagon/cAMP signaling, which also potently reduces itssecretion.Part of cAMP ’s hepatic action is mediated by the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 (Matsumoto et al, 2007 ), which was previously shown to regulate genes involved in retinoid home- ostasis in liver (Obrochta et al, 2015 ).We depleted Foxo1 by two different siRNA oligonucleotides in primary hepatocytes, reducing its mRNA and protein expression by >75% (Fig.3G,H).
This reduction was accompanied by a robust decrease of its known target gene “insulin like growth factor binding protein 1 ”(Igfbp1 ) (Durham et al, 1999 ). Likewise, mRNA expression of Rbp4 was reduced (Fig.3H), identifying Rbp4 as novel FOXO1 target in hepatocytes.Consistently, inactivating FOXO1 by insulin (Nakae et al, 2000 ) lowered expression of both Igfbp1 and Rbp4 in primary hepatocytes (Fig.3I).Regulation of Rbp4 expression by FOXO1 was previously reported in a β-cell line (Miyazaki et al, 2012 ).Interestingly, hepatocyte-speci ﬁc deletion of the insulin receptor in mouse liver, thereby preventi ng FOXO1 inactivation, rendered Figure 2.Fasting does not affect total RBP4 but reduces TTR and increases apo-RBP4 in the circulation.(A) Serum RBP4 and TTR levels of fed and fasted mice were analyzed by immunoblotting, and serum ADIPOQ served as loading control.

Fasting reduces retinoid levels in white adipose tissue but not in the liver or lung We next quantitated retinol and major retinyl esters in the liver. To our surprise, hepatic retinyl ester concentrations were signi ﬁcantly increased in mice that were fasted for 24 h (Fig.4A, left panel).Taken into account that prolonged fasting, besides reducing body weights,has distinctive effects on organ/tissue weights (Appendix Fig.S2), we multiplied retinoid concentrations with total tissue mass.After mass correction, there was no signi ﬁcant change in hepatic retinol or retinyl ester content in fasted mice (Fig.4A, right panel).Also in the lung, another organ with substantial retinoid storage (Shmarakov et al, 2023), fasting had no effect on total retinoid abundance (Fig.4B).
In contrast, fasting led to decreased retinol and retinyl ester content inboth inguinal and perigonadal white adipose tissue (ing/pgWAT), with comparable tissue concentrations but strongly reduced total WAT mass in fasted mice (Fig. 4C,D; Appendix Fig.S2).Thus, 24 h of fasting depletes retinoids in WAT but not those stored in the liver or lung.HSL is required for mobilization of WAT retinoids and to maintain circulating RBP4 and retinol concentrations during fasting To mobilize retinol into the circulation, stored tissue retinyl esters require prior hydrolysis.We therefore analyzed REH activities intissue lysates of 16 h-fasted mice in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors of adipose tissue triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and HSL, major acylglycerol lipases that also exhibit REH activity (Taschleret al, 2015 ;W e ie ta l , 1997 ).
Inhibition of ATGL by Atglistatin (iATGL) (Mayer et al, 2013 ) had no effect on hepatic and adipose REH activities, suggesting that A TGL is dispensable for retinol mobilization from liver and WAT (Fig. 5A).In contrast, inhibition of HSL by NNC-0076-0000-0079 (iHSL) (Schweiger et al, 2006 ) slightly decreased REH activi ty in liver lysates but almost completely abolished REH activity in WAT (Fig.5A).We conclude that HSL provides the quantitatively most important REH activity in WAT but not in the liver.Moreover, fasted mice with germline deletion of Hsl, lacking HSL expression in all tissues, including liver a n dp g W A T( F i g .E V 3 A )( H a e m m e r l ee ta l , 2002 )s h o w e dam o d e s t increase in liver REH activity but a lmost undetectable REH activity in WAT (Fig.5B), which is consistent with previous ﬁndings (Strom et al, 2009 ).In accordance with defective retinyl ester Figure 3.Expression and secretion of RBP4 in primary hepatocytes is regulated by cAMP and FOXO1.

Upon fasting, HSL activity is induced by catecholamines and other lipolytic hormones via cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation (Clifford et al, 2000 ;M c K n i g h te ta l , 1998 ; Sztalryd and Kraemer, 1994 ). We therefore analyzed circulating retinol and RBP4 levels in ad libitum-fed (= low HSL activity) and 16 h-fasted (= high HSL activity) mice (Fig.5C).Loss of HSL did not affect circulating retinol concentrations or RBP4 levels in ad libitum-fed animals (Fig.5D–F, RBP4 blots for ad libitum-fed mice shown in Appendix Fig.S3A).However, fastedmice lacking HSL failed to maintain their retinol and RBP4 levels in the circulation (Fig.5D–F), suggesting that HSL is required for retinyl ester hydrolysis and retinoid homeostasis speci ﬁcally during fasting.In liver, deletion of HSL trended to reduce RBP4 protein abundance during fasting (Fig.EV3C –E).
In contrast, mRNA and protein expression of RBP4 in pgWAT was not regulated by fastingbut reduced in mice lacking HSL (Fig. EV3F,H,I), potentially as a consequence of impaired PPAR activation (Rosell et al, 2012 ) upon the loss of HSL that was reported previously (Pajed et al, 2021 ; Strom et al, 2009 ) and evidenced by lower expression of canonical PPAR target genes (Fig.EV3G).To test whether livers of HSL knockout mice were per se defective in mobilizing retinyl ester stores, we fed wt mice and mice globallylacking HSL a vitamin A-de ﬁcient diet (VAD) (Fig.EV4A).After 9 weeks of VAD, plasma retinol concentrations in ad libitum-fed mice remained within the physiologic range and were not affected by globaldeletion of HSL (Fig.EV4B).On the other hand, overnight fasting reduced plasma retinol concentrations in mice lacking HSL (Fig.EV4C), as observed in fasted mice kept on normal chow(Fig.5D).
In the liver, retinol and retinyl ester contents were depletedby feeding VAD to the same extent in both genotypes (Fig. EV4D).This suggests that hepatic mobilization of retinyl esters upon feedingVAD is not compromised in mice that lack HSL.Taken together, we conclude that the global loss of HSL lowers circulating RBP4 and retinol concentrations during fasting, presumably via impaired retinylester hydrolysis and retinol mobilization from WAT.Retinol-free apo-RBP4 induces HSL-dependent retinol release from adipocytes The exact mechanism by which adipocytes release retinol is unknown (Steinhoff et al, 2022a ; Wei et al, 1997 ).Serum RBP4 is liver-derived (Thompson et al, 2017 ), suggesting that WAT, in contrast to liver, does not utilize holo-RBP4 secretion for retinol release.
Alternatively, circulating retinol-free apo-RBP4, derivedfrom holo-RBP4 upon retinol delivery, may function as a high- afﬁnity acceptor for cellular retinol molecules, as demonstrated previously for STRA6-mediated lo ading of apo-RBP4 (Isken et al, 2008 ; Kawaguchi et al, 2012 ; Muenzner et al, 2013 ).

We found that injected apo-RBP4 is easilydetectable in mouse serum, circulating for more than 8 h before complete excretion/metabolism 24 h after injection (Fig. 6A, top panel).Non-denaturing PAGE, re adily differentiating between holo-and apo-RBP4, demonstrated that the majority of the injected apo-RBP4 circulates as holo-RBP4 (Fig.6A, bottom panel), in accordance with the notion that apo-RBP4 in the circulation canquickly acquire retinol.Retinol for re-loading may originate fromtissues with retinyl ester stores and suf ﬁcient REH activity such as WAT, although retinol bound to other binding proteins, due to mass action of the apo-RBP4 bolus, may also contribute.
In order to test whether adipose tissue per se can provide retinol for apo-RBP4 loading, we incubated isolated fat pads with media containing 4% of BSA, a lower-af ﬁnity binding protein for retinol (N’Soukpoe-Kossi et al, 2007 ), with or without 2 µM of apo-RBP4.Retinol content in fat pad supernatant substantially increased in the presence of apo-RBP4 (Fig. 6B), suggesting that apo-RBP4 triggers retinol release from adipocytes.We then loaded differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Green and Meuth, 1974 ) with 20 µM retinol overnight to increase their reti nyl ester content, and incubated cells with media containing 4% BSA and apo-RBP4 as indicated.Like in fat pads, apo-RBP4 increased retinol concentrations in the adipocyte culture media, and this elevation was reduced by inhibiting HSL (Fig.6C).
Similar effects were observed in in vitro-differentiated primary adipocytes derived from wt or adipocyte-speci ﬁcHslknockout mice that were preloaded with retinol overnight, where retinol concentrations in adipocyte culturemedia were increased in the prese nce of apo-RBP4 but lower in the absence of HSL (Fig. 6D).Thus, extracellular apo-RBP4 induces HSL-dependent retinol release from adipocytes.HSL, speci ﬁcally in adipose tissue, is required for maintaining circulating RBP4 and retinol concentrationsduring fasting Having established the role of adipocyte-expressed HSL for retinol release in vitro, we next hypothesized that also adipocyte-speci ﬁcHsl deletion reduces circulating RBP4 and retinol concentrations during fasting, similar to the effects observed upon its global deletion.Indeed,adiponectin ( ADIPOQ ) promoter-driven Cre expression (Pajed et al, 2021), deleting HSL in adipose tissue but not liver of mice with ﬂoxed Hslalleles (Fig.
EV5A), lowered circulating retinol and RBP4 only in fasted-, but not in ad libitum-fed mice (Fig. 7A–D, RBP4 blots for ad libitum-fed mice shown in Appendix Fig.S3B).Irrespective of the feeding status, mRNA expression and protein abundance of RBP4 inthe liver was not affected by adipocyte-speci ﬁc HSL deletion (Fig.EV5B –E).Similar to mice with global deletion of HSL, mRNA and protein expression of RBP4 and that of canonical PPAR targetgenes were reduced in pgWAT of fasted Cre( +) mice (Fig.EV5F –I).We conclude that HSL expression in adipocytes is required to maintain circulating retinol and RBP4 concentrations, speci ﬁcally during fasting, most likely by driving retinol mobilization from adipose retinyl ester stores.Adipose tissue-speci ﬁc deletion of HSL affects retinoid homeostasis in the eye and kidney during fasting We next addressed whether reduced retinol concentrations in the circulation of fasted mice with adipose tissue-speci ﬁc deletion of HSL affects other organs.
Retinoid content of eyes in Cre( +)m i c e was unaltered (Fig. 7E), but gene expression of lecithin:retinol acyltransferase ( Lrat), a RAR target gene and component of the retinoid visual cycle (Batten et al, 2004 ), was elevated (Fig.7F), suggesting an adaptive increas e in retinyl ester synthesis to compensate for lower retinol levels in the circulation.In the kidney, with intrinsically lower retinyl ester stores than the eye,retinol concentration was reduced in Cre( +) mice, and retinyl esters showed a similar trend (Fig.7G, left panel).Since kidney weights of Cre( +) mice were lower (Fig.7H), consequently when calculated per organ, both the retinol and retinyl ester kidneycontents were reduced (Fig.7G, right panel).Surprisingly, renal gene expression analyses demonstrated a rather consistent upregulation of RAR target genes (Fig.7I), implying that a mobilization of renal retinoids to stabilize serum retinol Figure 6.

Discussion We discovered an unrecognized role of adipose tissue retinoidstores in the maintenance of serum retinol and RBP4 levels.Although HSL was previously linked to retinyl ester hydrolysis in adipocytes (Wei et al, 1997 ) and adipose tissue (Hansson et al, 2006 ; Strom et al, 2009 ), its importance for circulating retinol and RBP4 in fasted mice has not been reported. Selectively during fasting, mice with whole body- or adipocyte-speci ﬁcd e l e t i o no f HSL failed to maintain circulating r etinol and RBP4 at steady-state levels and, as a consequence, retinoid homeostasis in eye and kidney.The most likely interpretation of our ﬁndings is that upon fasting, when adipocyte HSL activity is intrinsically high due to hormonal stimulation, adipose tissue releases retinol in a HSL-dependent manner into the circulation.As an acceptor, retinol may bind thesmall but detectable fraction of retinol-free apo-RBP4 in blood.
If this release of retinol is hindered, as observed in mice lacking HSL, serum retinol levels decline and apo-RBP4, since not reacquiring retinol, islost by renal ﬁltration (Goodman, 1980). Quantitatively, retinoid content (retinol +retinyl esters) of all adipose tissue (assuming a ~15% fat mass) is estimated to exceed that of retinol in the circulationby 10-fold, suggesting that an insuf ﬁcient release upon fasting could indeed explain the observed drop in circulating retinol concentrations.Moreover, HSL-dependent retinol release, thus preventing the loss ofRBP4 by renal clearance, also argues for complex re-formation between holo-RBP4 and TTR in the circulation (Quadro et al, 2002; Wei et al, 1995), besides its intracellular assembly for holo-RBP4/TTR secretion by hepatocytes (Bellovino et al, 1996; Melhus et al, 1991).
Notably, HSL expression is highest in adipose tissue, suggesting that the mass action “pull ”of circulating apo-RBP4 to reacquire retinol in fasted mice may match speci ﬁcally with increased REH activity and retinol release of adipose tissue, but not with that of other tissues that store retinyl esters. This would explain why an adipocyte-speci ﬁcH S L knockout leads to similarly reduced retinol and RBP4 in the circulation as observed for its global deletion.The scenario of elevated retinol release from adipose tissue upon fasting is also compatiblewith the ﬁndings that fasting is associated with lower REH activity, reduced TTR expression, and an accumulation of RBP4 protein in the liver, suggesting that hepatic retinol mobilization via RBP4 secretionis reduced upon food withdrawal.Moreover, adipose- but not hepatic retinyl ester stores declined after 24 h of fasting.
Thus, fasting appears to induce a relative shift of retinol mobilization fromliver to a HSL-dependent mobilization from adipose tissue, warranting rather constant serum levels of retinol and RBP4 and as summarized in Fig. 7J.An alternative interpretation could be that loss of HSL, either globally or adipocyte-speci ﬁc, feeds back to reduce hepatic holo- RBP4 secretion speci ﬁcally during fasting.This could be signaled by adipose tissue-secreted proteins/adipokines or metabolites for interorgan crosstalk.Although we cannot rule out this hepatic contribution, and liver RBP4 appeared indeed reduced in fastedmice globally lacking HSL, adipocyte-speci ﬁc HSL knockout had no major effect on hepatic expression and abundance of RBP4.Different mechanistic scenarios of altered hepatic RBP4 expression,stability, or secretion could translate into lower RBP4 levels in thecirculation during fasting.
Nevertheless, since we observed that global HSL deletion did not affect the known induction of hepatic retinyl ester mobilization by feeding a VAD, this suggests thatRBP4-mediated retinol mobilization from liver into the circulation is not per se impaired by the loss of HSL. From a physiological perspective, fasting-induced retinol release by adipocytes seems plausible wh en considering similarities Figure 7.Adipose tissue-speci ﬁc HSL deletion lowers circulating retinol and RBP4 and modulates retinoid content and all- trans retinoic acid (atRA)- responsive gene expression in the kidney during fasting.(A)ADIPOQ -Cre(-) and Cre( +) mice with ﬂoxed Hslalleles were treated as depicted and ( B) plasma retinol analyzed by HPLC.( C) Plasma RBP4 in 16 h-fasted ADIPOQ -Cre(−) and Cre( +) mice was determined by immuno- blotting.Coomassie staining (CS) served as loading control.( D) Densitometric analysis of plasma RBP4 in ad libitum-fed and 16 h-fasted mice.

Subjecting mice that lack HSL in adipose tissue to fasting impairs retinyl estermobilization, reduces retinol release, and lowers circulating retinol and RBP4 which, in turn, modulates retinoid-sensitive gene expression and retinoid content in other organs. Source data are available online for this ﬁgure.EMBO reports Julia S Steinhoff et al 2884 EMBO reports Volume 25 | July 2024 | 2878 –2895 © The Author(s) between acylglycerols and retinyl esters regarding their chemical structure of esters with fatty acids, storage in liver and adipose tissue, and hydrolysis by the very same enzyme HSL formobilization from adipocytes.In vitro, recombinant rat HSL showed at least as high activity towards retinyl palmitate when compared to a diglyceride substrate (Strom et al, 2009 ).Hence, increased acylglycerol mobilization from adipose tissue by activated HSL during fasting appears to be directly linked to elevated mobilization of retinyl esters.
In contrast to serum NEFA levels,however, which rise upon fasting and stay high for 24 h in mice, we found that serum retinol remains rather stable. Although different fasting periods may induce some a lterations in its serum levels, stable steady-state levels likely result of a ﬁne-tuned coordination between liver and adipose tissue to keep serum retinol within the narrow physiological range.Indeed, we show that cAMP signalingin the liver, which is under the tight endocrine control of glucagon and catecholamines (Lelou et al, 2022 ), lowers RBP4 secretion by hepatocytes.This likely happens in a coordinated fashion asadipose tissue HSL activity rises.Strikingly, and in contrast to hepatocytes, adipocytes were shown to increase retinol release, thereby depleting their retinyl ester stores upon incubation withcAMP-analogues and in further support of a HSL-dependent process (Wei et al, 1997 ).
Other feedback mechanisms may include the expression and secretion of FGF21 by the liver, known to affectadipose tissue turnover and HSL expression and as previously shown to be regulated by hepatic retinol mobilization (Badman et al, 2007 ;I n a g a k ie ta l , 2007 ; Kliewer and Mangelsdorf, 2019 ; Steinhoff et al, 2022b ). Increasing mRNA expression of Rbp4 in liver and hepatocytes while reducing its secretion, as demonstrated for fasting-induced cAMP signaling, appears counterintuitive.However, intracellular functions of RBP4 for binding/buffering retinol but potentially also fatty acids (Ciof ﬁet al, 2019 ; Perduca et al, 2018 ) in liver during fasting, or an increased requirement for rapid RBP4 secretion upon re-feeding may consolidate thes e observations.Also, the exact mechanisms how adipocytes release retinol, predicted to resembleexport mechanisms for other hydrophobic species and presumably independent of STRA6 (Zemany et al, 2014 ), remain to be determined.
Whether adipocyte-expressed RBP4, although notreaching the systemic circulation (Thompson et al, 2017 ), participates in retinol release is unknown. RBP4 expression in adipose tissue was reduced upon the deletion of HSL, which may befunctionally linked to impaired retinol release.On the other hand, our in vitro data show that retinol release by adipocytes clearly depends on HSL, whereas the role of a (secondary) reduction inRBP4 levels in adipocytes remains uncertain.Because 3T3-L1 adipocytes express only marginal amounts of RBP4 (Rosell et al, 2012 ), the demonstrated impaired retinol release of these adipocytes due to pharmacological inhibition of HSL is likely independent of potential effects on RBP4 abundance.Adipose tissue-speci ﬁc deletion of HSL not only reduced retinol and RBP4 in the circulation after an overnight fast, but also affectedatRA-responsive gene expression and tissue retinoid content of other organs.
It appears plausible that gene expression responds to lower circulating retinol and RBP4 levels more sensitively than the overall tissue retinoid content, a nd that tissues with higher retinyl ester stores (i.e., the eye) show less disturbances than those with a lower content (i.e., kidney). However, the ﬁnding that Lrat expression in the eye and most RAR target genes in kidney wereupregulated is surprising.Although one might have hypothesized the opposite, which is reduced RAR target gene expression in a kidney with lower vitamin A content, increased RAR target geneexpression, including elevated Lrat expression, was previously observed in eyes of mice with severe vitamin A de ﬁciency (Moon et al, 2023 ).Tissue availability of atRA, the most potent RAR activator, may primarily correlate with ﬂ ux through retinol mobilization or retinyl ester st orage rather than total retinoid abundance.
Moreover, we would hypothesize that longer and/orrepeated decreases in circulating retinol/RBP4 in these mice, induced by more than a single overnight fast, may trigger additional defects in vitamin A-dependent processes. The lack ofa clear retinoid-dependent phenotype in fasted mice with adipose tissue-speci ﬁc deletion of HSL is a limitation of our study.When triggered, such defects may involve development, the immunesystem, and, regarding eyesight, a detectable depletion of retinoids in the murine eye with all its functional consequences (Quadro et al, 1999 ).Exemplary, this was shown for the RBP4 antagonist and RBP4/retinol-lowering compound A1120, where a 12-day treatment was required to decrease retinoids in the murine eyecup by 30 –50% (Dobri et al, 2013 ).Interestingly, mice globally lacking HSL were indeed shown to exhibit visual defects (Yuksel et al, 2023 ).
Although hypothesized to be caused by the deletion of substantial HSL expression in the eye (Yuksel et al, 2023 ), secondary effects of lower retin ol and RBP4 in the circulation during periods of limited food intake may contribute. Additionally, dysregulated retinol mobilization from adipose tissue may, at leastin part, contribute to the wide ly reported, yet incompletely understood observation of elevated RBP4 in the circulation of obese and insulin-resistant mice and humans (Nono Nankam andBluher, 2021 ;Y a n ge ta l , 2005 ).De-repressed HSL activity in WAT and retinol release may chronically increase RBP4 saturation and lower apo-RBP4 excretion, thereby contributing to the previously observed accumulation of holo-RBP4 in the circulation of HFD-fed mice (Muenzner et al, 2013 ).Further studies are needed to test these possibilities.
In regard to adipose tissue health, global or adipocyte-speci ﬁc HSL deletion has been shown to cause WAT dysfunction that can progress to lipoatrophy in later life (Harada et al, 2003 ; Osuga et al, 2000 ; Pajed et al, 2021 ). This adipose tissue dysfunction coincides with reduced gene expression of a whole variety of lipid metabolic pathways, suggesting that adequate retinol mobilization in adiposetissue is required for local transcriptional responses (Harada et al, 2003 ; Pajed et al, 2021 ;S t r o me ta l , 2009 ), presumably by providing precursors for RAR or RXR activating retinoids.Indeed, transcrip-tional defects and adipose tissue dysfunction in mice lacking HSL were partially rescued by the administration of atRA (Strom et al, 2009 ).In humans, a HSL null mutation causes dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, systemic insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.
Whether impaired retinyl ester hydrolysis in adipose tissue contributes to these pathologies is unknown and requires furtheranalyses. In summary, we provide evidence for tissue-speci ﬁc alterations of retinoid homeostasis and the unequivocal requirement of adipose-tissue HSL for maintain ing retinol and RBP4 levels in the circulation of fasted mice.However, insights into retinol ﬂux between liver, adipose tissue, and the circulation, although technically challenging, could further corroborate a shift in retinolmobilization.Nevertheless, the presented ﬁndings have importantJulia S Steinhoff et al EMBO reports © The Author(s) EMBO reports Volume 25 | July 2024 | 2878 –2895 2885 implications for the understanding of interorgan crosstalk to warrant retinoid homeostasis and widen our perspective on HSL- dependent pathologies.
Methods Animal experiments and characterization Animal procedures were approved by the corresponding authorities in Berlin/Germany (G 0100-11, G 0130-17, G 0076-22, O 0400-1) and Graz/Austria (39/9/75 ex 2017/18). All mice were on a C57BL/6Jgenetic background.Mice were housed under standard 12/12 h light/ dark cycles, and fed normal chow diet (R/M-Haltung, Ssniff Spezialdiaeten, Soest, Germany, 9% kcal/fat, 25 IU/g vitamin A, beforegamma irradiation).Fasting was initiated at indicated Zeitgeber time (ZT) by transferring mice to a new cage with indigestible bedding material and no chow.
Mice with global or adipose-tissue-speci ﬁc deletion of Hsl(Pajed et al, 2021; Strom et al, 2009) and respective control mice were housed under 14/10 h light/dark cycles and fed a standard laboratory chow diet (R/M-H Extrudate, V1126-027, 12%kcal/fat, 25 IU/g vitamin A, Ssniff Spezialdiaeten) or a vitamin A-deﬁcient diet as indicated (10 -mm pellets E15311-14, containing <0.12 IU/g vitamin A, Ssniff Spezialdiaeten). Blood glucose wasdetermined by tail vein punctures and glucometer test stripes (Contour, Bayer, Germany).Serum non-esteri ﬁed fatty acids (NEFA) were analyzed biochemically using the NEFA-HR kit (FUJIFILMWako Chemicals Europe) and liver triglycerides as described previously (Heidenreich et al, 2017).
Isolation, culture, and treatment of in vitro-differentiated primary adipocytes, primary hepatocytes, and 3T3-L1 cells 3T3-L1 cells (ATCC, CL-173, (Green and Meuth, 1974)) and a primary stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from inguinal white adipose tissue(ingWAT) of male mice were cultured and differentiated as described previously (Schreiber et al, 2015; Tolkachov et al, 2018; Witte et al, 2015). For ex vivo retinol release, perigonadal white adipose tissue (pgWAT) from male mice was isolated and cut into small pieces of ~3 mm diameter and incubated in DMEM containing low glucose (1 g/L) before 4% fatty acid (FA)-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) and2 µM apo-RBP4 were added as indicated in the respective ﬁgure.Primary hepatocytes were isolated as described elsewhere (Wilson et al, 2010) from male mice.After isolation, hepatocytes attached to the cell culture plate while cultured in DMEM with 4.5 g/L glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum for 5 h.
Hepatocytes were then switched to glucose- and serum-free DMEM with 2 mM of sodium pyruvate and 20 mM ofsodium lactate as fasting-mimicking conditions. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Merck) was used at 10 µM.Depletion of Foxo1 by siRNA (Appendix Table S1) in primary hepatocytes was performed asdescribed before (Heidenreich et al, 2017).Primary hepatocytes and adipocytes were incubated with compounds (all Merck) or apo-RBP4 for indicated time points and concentrations.Quanti ﬁcation of retinoids Serum retinol, retinol, and retinyl esters in tissues of ad libitum -fed and fasted wild-type (wt) mice on normal chow diet weredetermined by HPLC-PDA as described previously (Muenzner et al, 2013 ).The retinyl esters quanti ﬁed were retinyl oleate, -palmitate, and -stearate, accounting together for more than 95% ofall retinyl ester stores in liver (D ’Ambrosio et al, 2011 ).
Retinoids of plasma and tissue samples from Hslknockout and Hslﬂox/ﬂox ADIPOQ -Cre mice as well as supernatants of 3T3-L1 cells, primary differentiated SVF cells, and fat pad explants were analyzed by HPLC-FD as described previously (Pajed et al, 2019 ;W a g n e re ta l , 2022 ). In brief, tissues (20 –50 mg) were homogenized in 200 µl PBS, 200 µl ethanol (containing 2.8 µM retinyl acetate as internal standard), and 1 ml n-hexane (containing 1 mM butylhydroxyto- luene) using a ball mill (Retsch GmbH, Germany).Phase separationwas achieved by centrifugation at 5000 × gat 4 °C for 10 min and the upper organic phase was collected.For repeated extraction, 1 ml n-hexane was added to the remaining tissue homogenate, andvigorously vortexed for 20 s.For phase separation, samples were centrifuged at 5000 × gat 4 °C for 10 min.
Organic phases were combined and dried in a speed-vac (Labconco, Kansas City, MO).Plasma (20 µl) and cell supernatants (200 –300 µl) were directly n-hexane extracted by vortexing. For retinoid analyses by HPLC- FD, retinoids were separated on a YMC-Pro C18 column(150 × 4.6 mm, S –3μl, 12 nm, YMC Europe GmbH, Dinslaken, Germany) using a gradient solvent system ( ﬂow, 2 ml/min; gradient, 0 –2 min 100% methanol, 2 –4.2 min 60%/40% methanol/ toluene, and 4.2 –6 min 100% methanol).Fluorescence was detected at excitation 325 nm/emission 490 nm.The HPLC consisted of a Waters e2695 separation module, a column oven (at 25 °C), and aWaters 2475 ﬂuorescence detector (Waters Corp., Milford, MA).Data were analyzed using Empower 3 chromatography data software (Waters Corp.).Area under the peak was standardizedagainst known amount of the internal standard retinyl acetate.Retinoid content was normalized to mg tissue, whole tissue weight, or cell protein as indicated.
Determination of retinyl ester hydrolase activity Measurement of ex vivo retinyl es ter hydrolase (REH) activity was performed as previously described (Pajed et al, 2019 ). In brief, tissue lysates of the liver (1000 × g, supernatant) or WAT (20,000 × g, interphase) were incubated with retinyl palmitate (150 µM) emulsi ﬁed with phosphatidylcholine (150 µM) in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM) for 1 h at 37 °C.Released retinol was n-hexane extracted and measured by HPLC- FD analysis as described above.Where indicated, the incubation mixtures contained either DMSO (vehicle control), Atglistatin(iATGL; 20 µM), or the HSL inhibitor NNC-0076-0000-0079 (iHSL; 20 µM).
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and analysis of gene expression by quantitative PCR (qPCR) Total RNA was puri ﬁed by spin column kits (VWR), translated to cDNA using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega), and analyzed by qPCR as described previously using standard curves for each primer pair and Rplp0 expression for normalization (Heidenreich et al, 2020 ). Isolation of RNA, DNAse digestion, cDNA synthesis, and qPCR from liver samples of Hslﬂox/ﬂoxADIPOQ -Cre mice were performed as previously described (Jaeger et al, 2015 ).Target gene expression was calculated by theΔΔCT method.Expression ofEMBO reports Julia S Steinhoff et al 2886 EMBO reports Volume 25 | July 2024 | 2878 –2895 © The Author(s) ribosomal housekeeping gene CycloB was used for normalization.Primer sequences are listed in Appendix Table S2.Protein isolation and immunoblotting Protein was isolated by standa rd methods using RIPA buffer.
Tissue/cell protein or mouse serum (diluted 1:25) was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to a PVDF membrane. For immunoblots analyzing the abundance of denat ured TTR monomers, liver/serum samples were incubated in boiling water for 20 min prior loading.Non-denaturated PAGE of mouse serum for the detection of holo- and apo-RBP4 was carried out in the absence of SDS and aspreviously described (Muenzner et al, 2013 ).Tissue lysates (10–20 µg) of Hslknockout and Hslﬂox/ﬂox ADIPOQ-Cre mice were prepared as previously described (Pajed et al, 2019 ).Proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane.The membrane was blocked with 4 –10% non-fat dry milk (dissolved in TST) and incubated with primary antibodies.After incubation with primary antibodies (Appendix Table S3), secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies were added, and chemiluminescence was detected (Thermo Scienti ﬁc).
Densito- metric analyses were performe db yI m a g e J( S c h n e i d e re ta l , 2012 ). Synthesis of recombinant apo-RBP4 Recombinant human apo-RBP4 used for the injection into mice was synthesized in E.coli as described elsewhere (Kawaguchi and Sun, 2010; Muenzner et al, 2013).Apo-RBP4 for the incubation of fat pad explants and adipocytes in vitro was generated in Pichia pastoris according to a published protocol (Wysocka-Kapcinska et al, 2010).Statistics Sample sizes in mouse experiments and the number of replicates in cell culture experiments were based on previous experience with similar studies but not predetermined.No speci ﬁc guidelines were followed.Animals were randomized into groups of dietary interventions.During mouse characterization, the operator was blinded regarding the mouse genotype.Reported replicates for in vitro cell culture experiments arereplicates of independent wells of cultured and treated cells.
