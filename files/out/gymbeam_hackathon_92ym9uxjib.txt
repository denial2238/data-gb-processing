Purpose: Our purpose was to examine the effects of 2 yr of creatine monohydrate sup- plementation and exercise on bone health in postmenopausal women. Methods: Two hundred and thirty-seven postmenopausal women (mean age, 59 yr) were randomized to receive creatine (0.14 g·kg−1·d−1) or placebo during a resistance training (3 d·wk−1) and walking (6 d·wk−1) program for 2 yr.Our primary outcome was the femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD), with lumbar spine BMD and proximal femur geometric pr operties as the secondary outcomes.Results: Compared with placebo, creatine supplementation had no effect on BMD of the femoral neck (creatine: 0.725 ± 0.110 to 0.712 ± 0.100 g·cm−2; placebo: 0.721 ± 0.102 to 0.706 ± 0.097 g·cm−2), total hip (creatine: 0.879 ± 0.118 to 0.872 ± 0.114 g·cm−2; placebo: 0.881 ± 0.111 to 0.873 ± 0.109 g·cm−2), or lumbar spine (creatine: 0.932 ± 0.133 to 0.925 ± 0.131 g·cm−2; placebo: 0.923 ± 0.145 to 0.915 ± 0.143 g·cm−2).
Creatine significantly maintained section modulus (1.35 ± 0.29 to 1.34 ± 0.26 vs 1.34 ± 0.25 to 1.28 ± 0.23 cm3(placebo), P= 0.0011), predictive of bone bending strength, and buckling ratio (10.8 ± 2.6 to 11.1 ± 2.2 vs 11.0 ± 2.6 to 11.6 ± 2.7 (placebo), P= 0.011), predictive of reduced cortical bending under compressive loads, at the narrow part of the femoral neck. Creatine reduced walking time over 80 m (48.6 ± 5.6 to 47.1 ± 5.4 vs 48.3 ± 4.5 to 48.2 ± 4.9 s (placebo), P= 0.0008) but had no effect on muscular strength (i.e., one-repetition maximum) during bench press (32.1 ± 12.7 to 42.6 ± 14.1 vs 30.6 ± 10.9 to41.4 ± 14 kg (placebo)) and hack squat (57.6 ± 21.6 to 84.4 ± 28.1 vs 56.6 ± 24.0 to 82.7 ± 25.0 kg (placebo)).In the subanalysis of valid com-pleters, creatine increased lean tissue mass compared with placebo (40.8 ± 5.7 to 43.1 ± 5.9 vs 40.4 ± 5.3 to 42.0 ± 5.2 kg (placebo), P=0 .0 4 6 ) .
Conclusions: Two years of creatine supplementation and exercise in postmenopausal women had no effect on BMD; yet, it improved some bone geometric properties at the proximal femur. Key Words: BONE MINERAL DENSITY, BONE GEOMETRY, WALKING Low bone mineral density (BMD), leading to osteoporosis, places a high burden on health care systems (1).Althoughexercise programs such as resistance training and walking have been shown effective for improvi ng BMD (2,3), the short-term effects are small and may not be clinically relevant.Creatine is a nitrogen-containi ng compound synthesized in the kidneys and liver or consumed in the diet primarily from red meatand seafood (4).When creatine combines with phosphate (asphosphocreatine), it provides a source of energy for cells, includ-ing bone cells (5).The addition of creatine to low serum cell cul-ture medium increases the metabolic activity and differentiation of osteoblasts, the cells involved in bone formation (5).
Creatine supplementation also reduces bone resorption (i.e., bone catab-olism) in young boys with muscular dystrophy (6,7) and inolder men during a supervised resistance training program (8). We showed in a small preliminary study that creatine sup- plementation combined with supervised resistance training in-creased femoral neck BMD in postmenopausal women, withthe increase in BMD reaching levels that approached those thought to clinically reduce fracture risk (9).The femoral neck is recognized as the most clinically relevant site, as there isAddress for correspondence: Philip D.Chilibeck, Ph.D., College of Kinesiol- ogy, University of Saskatchewan, 87 Campus Dr., Saskatoon, SK, Canada S7N 5B2; E-mail: phil.chilibeck@usask.ca.Submitted for publication October 2022.Accepted for publication April 2023.Supplemental digital content is available for this article.

Ourprevious study indicated an approximate 3.4% preservationof BMD at the femoral neck in a small group ( n= 33) of post- menopausal women over 1 yr of creatine supplementation dur- ing a supervised resistance training program (9); therefore, wehypothesized that a longer intervention (i.e., 2 yr) may be nec-essary to achieve a clinically significant increase in BMD. In addition to BMD, geometric properties of bone also af- fect bone strength.Geometric properties around the proximalfemur, assessed using hip structural analysis, are good predic-tors for fracture (12,13).
We recently showed that femoral neck section modulus, a predictor of bone bending strength, tended to increase ( P= 0.061) in older men who supplemented with creatine during 1 yr of supervised resistance training (14).We also demonstrated that geometric properties around otherbone sites (i.e., cross-sectional area (CSA) of the tibia) wereimproved with creatine supplementation and supervised resistancetraining programs in older men and postmenopausal women (15). Our primary purpose was to determine whether creatine supplementation during a longer-ter m supervised resistance train- ing and walking program (i.e., 2 yr) could improve BMD at thefemoral neck in postmenopausal women.A secondary purposewas to determine the effects of creatine on BMD at the lumbarspine and on geometric properties at the proximal femur.We hy-pothesized that creatine supplementation would be beneficial forimproving BMD and bone geometric properties.METHODS Study design.
This two-site randomized controlled trial was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Boards atthe University of Saskatchewan and University of Regina. Par-ticipants were informed of the risks and purposes of the studybefore written consent was obtained.The study complied withthe World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki —Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.Thetrial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02047864).The study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, repeated measures design at two centers: theUniversity of Saskatchewan and University of Regina.
Partic-ipants were randomized using a computer-generated alloca-tion schedule to one of two groups (on a 1/1 ratio) for a 2-yrintervention: group 1 —creatine monohydrate supplementa- tion ( n= 120, 0.14 g·kg −1·d−1mixed with 0.14 g·kg−1·d−1 maltodextrin) and supervised resistance training plus partially supervised walking; or group 2 —placebo (control; n=1 1 7 , 0.28 g·kg−1·d−1maltodextrin) and supervised resistance train- ing plus partially supervised walking. Creatine supplementation.Participants were provided with the supplement in plastic Ziploc bags and instructed tomix supplements with water.The creatine monohydrate supple-ment (Creapure; AlzChem AG, Trosberg, Germany) was verifiedfor purity (Cary Co., Addison, IL) and determined to be 99.9% pure with minimal contaminants (i.e., 44 mg·kg −1creatinine, 28 mg·kg−1dicyandiamide, and below the limit of detection fordihydrotriazine).
On the days when participants performed resis- tance training, half of the supplement was consumed postexercise(approximately 5 min) under research assistant supervision, andthe other half was consumed with a meal. On rest days when participants did not visit the resistance training facility, they consumed one-third of the supplement with each meal.Com-pliance was monitored by completing a supplement trackinglog.The dose we chose (0.14 g·kg −1·d−1) was slightly higher than that used in our previous study (0.10 g·kg−1·d−1)w h e r e we observed an increase in femoral neck BMD in a small groupof postmenopausal women (9) because this smaller dose was inef-fective for increasing lean tissue mass or muscular strength, indi- cating a possible anabolic resistance in postmenopausal women.
All participants received a supplement of 500 mg of calcium and 10μg( 4 0 0I U )o fv i t a m i nDp e rd a yt o ensure that most participants were meeting Osteoporosis Society of Canada recommendationsof 1200 mg·d −1for calcium and 20 μg·d−1for vitamin D (10). A research assistant at the University of Saskatchewan with no other role in the study performed a stratified block random-ization using a computer-generated allocation schedule.Ran- domization was performed using a fixed block size of eight (using a permuted block design with a computer random num-ber generator).Participants were stratified as either 1 –9y ra f t e r menopause or >9 yr after menopause to account for differingrates of bone loss after menopause (16).The allocation sequence was concealed from other research assistants enrolling and assessing participants.Participantswere given their allocated supplement after completing all baseline assessments.
Participants, researchers, and those in- volved in outcome assessment or resistance training supervi-sion were blinded to the group assignment. Another researchassistant oversaw all data entry during which they remainedblinded to group allocations by coding of groups.Statisticalanalyses were performed blinded (by coding of groups).Before codes were revealed at the end of the study, partici- pants were surveyed to assess the effectiveness of blinding by asking if they thought they were on creatine or placebo.Exercise training.Resistance exercises and brisk walk- ing were performed in-lab and supervised 3 d·wk −1.A na d d i - tional 3 d of nonsupervised brisk walking was performed out-side of the laboratory.
Exercises performed during resistance training included hack squat, hip abduction, adduction, flexion, and extension using amultihip machine, bench press, lat pull-down, shoulder press, hamstrings curl, quadriceps (knee) extension, biceps curl, triceps extension (presses), and back ex tension. Participants initially took part in a 2-wk familiarization process (two supervised ses- sions per week, 2 sets of 10 repetitions per exercise) where lightresistance was used and proper form was emphasized.
After the familiarization phase, participants took part in strength assess-ments and then enrolled in the resistance training program thatinvolved two sets of eight repetitio ns for each exercise to muscu- lar fatigue with 2-min rest between sets for each exercise at an in- tensity corresponding to a load e qual to or >80% one-repetition maximum (1RM) (i.e., 80% of their maximal strength, for thebench press and hack squat) or the maximal amount of weight CREATINE AND BONE Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise ®1751CLINICAL SCIENCES that could be lifted eight times (i.e., 8RM). Resistance was pro- gressively increased by 2 –5 kg once a participant could complete two sets of eight repetitions for an exercise.All exercises wereperformed on plate-loaded or weight stack machines (Lever Fitness or Hammer Strength, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada).
The walking program involved 20 –30 min of brisk walking per session at an intensity corresponding to 70% of age-predicted max-imum heart rate (220 −age). This duration was chosen as it would ensure participants were meeting the recommendations set by theCanadian Physical Activity Guidelines for Older Adults of ap-proximately 150 min·wk −1of moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity (17).Participants were educated how to take a 15-s ra- dial pulse count to ensure they were exercising at the proper intensity.Compliance was monitored by recording and track-ing exercise in training logs.Participants.Participants were recruited from January 2014 to July 2016, and all had completed the intervention byJanuary 2019.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) post-menopausal women (no menstrual period in the past 2 yr, de-termined by questionnaire —if a participant reported being <2 yr postmenopausal, menopausal status was confirmed with blood testing for luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulatinghormone) and 2) considered at “low”and“moderate ”risk of fracture according to the Osteoporosis Canada guidelines(10).
Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) preexisting kidneyor liver abnormalities (determined by blood and urine tests), 2)high risk of fragility fracture according to OsteoporosisCanada guidelines (10), 3) taking bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or creatine monohydrate in thepast 12 months, 4) currently taking corticosteroids, or any med-ication that affects bone mineral metabolism, 5) severe osteoar-thritis, Crohn ’s disease, or Cushing disease, 6) planning to travel during the study for greater than a 2-wk duration atone time, and 7) currently involved in resistance training(>20 min per session, more than twice per week). Participants were recruited via newspaper and e-mail advertisements and posters from the cities of Saskatoon and Regina, in the provinceof Saskatchewan, Canada.Outcome assessments.
A l lo u t c o m e sw e r ea s s e s s e da t baseline, at the end of year 1, and at the end of year 2. Falls andfractures were recorded for an additional year after completionof the study (i.e., 3 yr).Height and mass were measured by a standard stadiometer and a calibrated electronic scale.Measurements of outcomes from dual-energy X-ray absorpti- ometry are described in detail elsewhere (18).Briefly, BMD ofthe proximal femur (i.e., femoral neck, trochanter, Ward ’s area, and total hip), lumbar spine (L1 –L4 vertebrae), and total body, and whole-body lean tissue mass (excluding bone) were measuredby dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in array mode (QDRDiscovery Wi; Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MD) using QDR soft- ware for Windows XP (QDR Discovery).DXA scanners were identical at both university centers.
Hip structural analysis (19) was used to assess geometric characteristics of the proximal femur using DXA at the narrowestpart of the femoral neck, the intertrochanteric region, and the fem- oral shaft (i.e., 2 cm distal to the midpoint of the lesser trochanter).The following were assessed at each region: cortical thickness,subperiosteal width (SPW), bone CSA, which is equivalent to the cortical area, cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI), section modulus (Z), and buckling ratio. Higher CSMI and Zare associated with strength of bone in bending, and higherbuckling ratio is associated with susceptibility of cortical bend- ing under compressive loads (19).Ultrasound (Sunlight, Omnisense, 7000S; BeamMed Ltd., Petah Tikva, Israel) was used at the distal radius and tibial shaftto assess bone speed of sound.A higher bone speed of sound pre- dicts enhanced architectural arrangement of bone (20).
This assess- ment was only conducted at the University of Saskatchewan site(n= 160), as it was the only site with the required equipment. Strength in the lower and upper body was assessed by deter- mining 1RM during hack squat and bench press, respectively,with methods as previously described (21).Dynamic balance was measured as the time taken to per- form backward tandem walking (i.e., toe to heel) over a dis- tance of 6 m on a 10-cm-wide board that was raised 4 cm off the ground (18).Walking speed was assessed over an 80-m course, with the instructions to walk at a fast pace (22).Uncontrolled intervention factors.Dietary intake was assessed using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (Block 98.2FFQ; Block Dietary Data Systems, Berkeley, CA).After thequestionnaires were filled out, they were then sent out for anal- ysis (www.nutritionquest.com; Nutrition Quest, Berkeley, CA).Physical activity outside of st udy requirements was assessed using a Leisure-Time Exer cise Questionnaire (23).
Fasting blood and urine analyses and 24-h urine analysis were completed at baseline, year 1, and year 2 to measure markers ofkidney and liver function (e.g., creatinine clearance, urea, al-bumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine amino-transferase, alkaline phosphatase, urine specific gravity, pro- tein, and microalbumin) and complete blood counts. Blood was centrifuged at 3200 rpm for 10 min at 20°C.All bloodand urine analyses were carried out on a fully automated ran-dom access analyzer for clinical chemistry (Cobas C 311;Roche Diagnostic, Mannhein, Germany) at the Royal Univer-sity Hospital (Saskatoon) and at the Regina General Hospital.Resultant values were reviewed by our physician coinvestiga-tors.Any values outside the normal reference range were con- sidered an adverse event.Adverse events.Adverse events were collected on adverse event forms each time participan ts were in contact with the re- searchers.
These included a description of the adverse event, re-lationship to the intervention (no t related, unlikely, possibly, probably, or definite), whether it was serious (i.e., resulted indeath, life-threatening, required hospitalization, or resulted inpersistent disability) or nonser ious, and its intensity (mild, mod- erate, severe, or life-threatening). We paid special attention to ad- verse events that might be a concern with creatine supplementa-tion, such as kidney or liver adverse events, gastrointestinalproblems, and muscle cramping.As a conservative approach http://www.acsm-msse.org 1752 Official Journal of the American College of Sports MedicineCLINICAL SCIENCES to the safety of participants, we had physicians review adverse events, and they made decisions on whether to reduce thecreatine/placebo dose based on pot ential kidney or liver-related adverse events (i.e., measurement of blood and/or urine pa- rameters that might indicate liver/kidney problems).Statistics.
The sample size calculation was based on a clinically significant difference of 5% in BMD at the femoralneck, which was considered our primary outcome variable.This difference would be expected to reduce fracture risk by25% (11). Based on the results of our previous 1-yr study (9),we expected that a 2-yr intervention could elicit differences be-tween creatine and placebo group s at a clinically significant level of 5%.Baseline femoral neck BMD in postmenopausal women with similar exclusion criteria is about 0.739 g·cm −2 with a standard deviation of 0.093 g·cm−2(18,24).A clinically significant difference of 5% would result in a BMD of0.776 g·cm −2.Using these predicted values for placebo and cre- atine groups (i.e., 0.739 and 0.776 with an SD of 0.093 g·cm−2), an alpha of 0.05, and a power of 80%, required a sample size of101 per group (i.e., 202 total).
In a previous 2-yr exercise train- ing study of postmenopausal women from our laboratory, 15% were lost to follow-up (18); therefore, we required approxi-mately 120 per group or 240 postmenopausal women for thismultisite randomized controlled trial. Reproducibility of all dependent variables was determined by repeated measures 3 –7 d apart on 18 participants and expressed as percentage coefficient of variation (25), intraclasscorrelation coefficient (26), standard error of the mean (26), and minimal difference to be real (27).The percentage of par- ticipants from each group with a beneficial or detrimentalchange that exceeded the minimal difference to be real is pre-sented in each results table.All data were checked for outliers by first plotting variables at each time point in a scatter plot.
Outlier data points werethen checked to see if they were greater than 2.5 /C2the median absolute difference (28), and any outliers were replaced by im- puted values (see hereafter, this accounted for <0.2% of all data points). Baseline variables between groups were com-pared using independent samples t-tests.Our primary analysis was on an intent-to-treat basis; th at is, all participants who were randomized were included in their original groups for analysisirrespective of their complianc ew i t ht h ee x e r c i s ep r o g r a mo r supplement.Separate analyses were conducted including onlyparticipants who completed th e entire intervention (i.e., valid-completers analysis) an d for participants who were deemed to have been adequately compliant with the interven-tion.Adequate compliance was chosen as consuming 50% ofthe creatine supplement and attending 60% of the resistancetraining sessions.
These cut-offs were chosen because thislevel of creatine supplementation (i.e., 50% of 0.14 g·kg −1·d−1) would approximate the daily amount that is usually recom-mended (i.e., 5 g·d −1), and the number of resistance training ses- sions (approximately 2 d·wk−1) is the amount recommended by physical activity guidelines for older adults (17). Any missingdata were assumed to be missing at random.This included datamissing because of participants who were lost to follow-up(about 13% of all data points), outlier exclusion (<1% of all data points), poor positioning during hip scans (for hip structuralanalyses) (<1% of all data points), participants who missedtesting appointments (1% of all data points), and participants who decided not to take part in fitness testing because of joint soreness (2% of data points for fitness testing variables).Mul-tiple imputation was used to impute missing data for theintent-to-treat analyses (SPSS version 29, Chicago, IL).
In or-der to protect against type I error, outcomes were grouped into“bone density ”outcomes, “bone geometric ”outcomes, and “fitness testing ”outcomes, with each of these groups of vari- ables analyzed by a 2 (group; i.e., creatine vs placebo) /C23 (time, i.e., baseline, year 1, year 2) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), with repeated measures on the “time” factor. If multivariate tests were significant, univariate tests,with Bonferroni post hoc tests (to correct for multiple compar- isons), were used to determine differences between groupsacross time points.Lean tissue mass, bone ultrasound out-comes, dietary variables, and physical activity levels outsideof the program were assessed with a 2 (group) /C23( t i m e ) ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests to determine differ- ences between pairs of means.Compliance to the interventionand number of falls and fractures over 3 yr were assessed witha between-groups ANOVA.
Proportion of participants whowere able to correctly guess which group they were in, differ-ences in adverse events between groups, and differences betweengroups for percentage of participants who exceeded the minimaldifferences to be real were assessed by chi-square analysis. All re- sults are presented as mean ± SD.All MANOVAs or ANOVAs were run with Statistica 7.0 (Statsoft, Chicago, IL).Significancewas accepted at P≤0.05.RESULTS At baseline, the creatine group ( n= 120) had an age (mean ± SD) of 59.0 ± 5.6 yr, body mass of 73.3 ± 14.9 kg, and height of164 ± 6 cm with corresponding values for the placebo group(n= 117) of 59.0 ± 5.7 yr, 71.8 ± 14.2 kg, and 163 ± 6 cm, respectively.All other baseline variables are presented in Tables 1 –4.There were no differences between groups for any variables at baseline.Reproducibility of variables is pre-sented in Supplemental Table 1 (see Supplemental DigitalContent, http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857).
Compliance (de-fined as the amount of supplement consumed relative to theamount prescribed) with the supplement was 56% for the creatinegroup and 60% for the placebo group ( P> 0.05). Compliance with the calcium and vitamin D supplement was 70% and 68% for the creatine and placebo groups, respectively ( P> 0.05).Both groups had 61% compliance (defined as the number of exercisesessions completed relative to the number prescribed) withthe resistance training program, and compliance for the walk-ing program was 65% and 60% for the creatine and placebogroups, respectively ( P>0 .0 5 ) .Participant flow through the study is presented in Figure 1.Loss to follow-up was similar between groups.Reasons for loss to follow-up are presented in the figure, with lack of time CREATINE AND BONE Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise ®1753CLINICAL SCIENCES as the most common reason for withdrawing from the study.
At the end of the study, 50% and 43% of participants in the creatine andplacebo groups, respectively, were able to correctly guess whichgroup they were in ( P> 0.05), with the remaining participants either guessing the incorrect group or stating they were unsure. BMD, Bone Ultrasound, and Lean Tissue Mass No group –time interaction for the MANOVA assessing BMD outcomes in the intent-to-treat analysis was evident (P= 0.59, Table 1).Likewise, there was no group –time interaction for the valid-completers analysis (see Supplemen-tal Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content, BMD, bone speedof sound, and lean tissue mass at baseline, year 1, and year 2for creatine and placebo groups (valid completers), http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857) or the compliers analysis (seeSupplemental Table 5, Supplemental Digital Content, BMD, bone speed of sound, and lean tissue mass at baseline, year 1, and year 2 for creatine and placebo groups (compliers), http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857).
In t he compliers analysis, there was a greater percentage of participants in the creatine comparedwith the placebo group who exceeded the minimal difference tobe real for increases in total hip BMD ( P= 0.0071), but there was also a greater percentage of participants who exceeded the mini-mal difference to be real for decreases in Wards BMD ( P= 0.01) and lumbar spine BMD ( P= 0.0007). There was also a greater percentage of participants in the placebo compared with the cre-atine group who exceeded the minimal difference to be real forincreases in lumbar spine BMD ( P= 0.012) (see Supplemental Table 5, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857).
A significant group –time interaction was found for distal ra- dius speed of sound ( P= 0.002) in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 1) and the valid-completers analysis (see Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content, BMD, bone speed ofsound, and lean tissue mass at baseline, year 1, and year 2 for cre- atine and placebo groups (valid completers), http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857). The Bonferroni post hoc analysis indicated that the creatine group distal radius speed of sound decreasedfrom baseline to year 1 ( P< 0.05) but increased from year 1 to year 2 ( P< 0.05).There were no differences between groups for percentage of participants who exceeded the minimal dif- ference to be real for any of the bone ultrasound measures.A significant group –time interaction was evident for lean tissue mass ( P= 0.046) in the valid-completers analysis, with a greater increase in the creatine group (see Supplemental Table2, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857).
This was not significant in the intent-to-treat or compliers analyses (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 5, SupplementalDigital Content, http://links.lww .com/MSS/C857). The Bonferroni post hoc analysis from the valid completers indicated that both groups increased from baseline to year 1 and from baseline to year2 (both P< 0.0001).For the valid-completers analysis, there was a lower percentage of participants from the creatine comparedwith the placebo group who exceeded the minimal differenceto be real for decreases in lean tissue mass ( P= 0.046; Supple- mental Table 2, Supplementa l Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857).Bone Geometric Outcomes from the Proximal Femur Geometric outcomes from hip structural analyses (i.e., the intent-to-treat analyses) are presented in Table 2.There wasa significant group –time interaction from the MANOVA from the intent-to-treat analysis ( P= 0.00003).

The Bonferroni post hoc test indicated that time to walk 80 m de- creased in the creatine group from baseline to year 1 and base- line to year 2 (both P< 0.0001). This group –time interaction remained significant in the valid-completers analysis (Supple-mental Table 4, Supplemental Digital Content, exercise per-formance measures at baseline, year 1, and year 2 for creatineand placebo groups (valid completers); P= 0.013, http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857) with Bonferroni post hoc testing indicat- ing the creatine group decreased from baseline to year 1 and base- line to year 2 ( P< 0.001).In all analyses, both groups signifi- cantly improved bench press and squat strength ( P< 0.0001) with no differences between groups (Table 3 and SupplementalTables 4 and 7, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857).
There were no differences between groupsfor any exercise measures in the compliers analysis (Supplemen-tal Table 7, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857). There was a greater percentage of participants from the creatine compared with the placebo group who exceeded the minimal difference to be real for improvement in walkingspeed (decreased time to cover 80 m; P< 0.0001) in all anal- yses (Table 3 and Supplemental Tables 4 and 7, SupplementalDigital Content, http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857).Uncontrolled Intervention Factors (Physical Activity Score and Dietary Intake) Changes in physical activity and diet (outside of the interven- tion) between groups are shown in Table 4.There were nogroup –time interactions for physical activity or daily intake of calories, protein, calcium, or vitamin D.Falls and Fractures From baseline to 3 yr (i.e., 1 yr after the end of the interven- tion), reported falls were 30 in the creatine group and 19 in theplacebo group ( P= 0.24).
There were four fractures in each group. Fractures in the creatine group included spine, patella,radius, and ribs; fractures in the placebo group included finger,toes (two), and ankle.None of these fractures were consideredrelated to the exercise intervention.Adverse Events Kidney.Twenty kidney-related adverse events occurred in 15 participants in the creatine group, and 24 kidney-related ad- verse events occurred in 21 participants in the placebo group (P> 0.05).
These included high urine albumin –creatinine ratio (two creatine participants), high urine microalbumin (threecreatine and six placebo participants), hemoglobin in the urine(three creatine and eight placebo participants), low creatinineclearance (one creatine participant and 2 placebo participants),high blood creatinine (six creatine participants), low estimatedglomerular filtration rate (four creatine participants), protein in the urine (six placebo participants), low urine creatinine (one placebo participant), kidney cysts (one placebo participant),and kidney infection (one creatine participant). All kidney-related adverse events were rated as “possibly related ”to the intervention and“mild”in severity, except the kidney infection, which was rated as “moderate ”in severity.Liver.Nine liver-related adverse events were reported in seven participants in the creatine group, and six liver-relatedadverse events occurred in five participants in the placebogroup ( P> 0.05).
These included high liver enzymes in the blood, that is, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotrans-ferase (six creatine and three placebo participants), bilirubin inurine (one creatine participant), and low albumin (one creatineparticipant and two placebo participants). All liver-related ad- verse events were rated as “possibly related ”to the interven- tion and “mild”in severity.Gastrointestinal.Thirteen gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in 13 participants in the creatine group, and 17 gastro-intestinal adverse events occur red in 14 participants in the pla- cebo group ( P > 0.05).These included bloating, constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, and acid reflux.
These were classi-fied as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the interven- tion, and all were mild in severity except one case of heartburn (moderate), one case of constipation (moderate), two cases ofdiarrhea (moderate), two cases of nausea (moderate and severe)in the placebo group, and one ca se of upset stomach (moderate) and one case of heartburn (moderate) in the creatine group. Muscle cramps.Two participants in each group reported muscle cramps during the study.These were rated as possiblyor probably related to the intervention, and two were rated as “mild”and two as “moderate ”(one in the creatine and one in the placebo group) in severity.Other musculoskeletal adverse events.
Other muscu- loskeletal adverse events reported ( n= 172) during the interven- tion were rated as possibly, probably, or definitely related to theintervention (i.e., the exercise tr aining), and all were rated as mild or moderate except for one rated as “severe ”(tendonitis and pain in the Achilles tendon, plantar fasci a, and anterior tibia). Most ad- verse events were related to muscle soreness or joint pain.One participant dropped a 5-lb weight on her toe, which caused bruis-ing.Four participants had falls during the walking intervention, which caused injury (one swollen knee, rated as “moderate, ” one neck and upper back pain, rated as “moderate, ”one tailbone pain, rated as “moderate, ”and shoulder pain, rated as “mild”).
Out of all reported adverse events, only one that was consid- ered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the intervention was rated as “serious ”(a fall off the treadmill causing a swollen knee) because the injury was judged to have resulted in impair-ment of performance of everyday activities. Three participantswithdrew from the study due to adverse events: two in the cre-atine group (due to diarrhea and self-reported allergy to themetal from the exercise machines) and one in the placebogroup (due to an injury when falling off a treadmill) (Fig.1).DISCUSSION The main finding from this randomized controlled trial was that creatine monohydrate supplementation during a resistance CREATINE AND BONE Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise ®1757CLINICAL SCIENCES training and walking program over 2 yr had no effect on BMD at the femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine.
There was var-iation across groups for percentages of participants whoexceeded minimal differences to be real for changes in BMD in the compliers analysis (e.g., greater percentage of partici- pants in the creatine group exceeding the minimal differenceto be real for increases in total hip BMD, but also decreasesin Wards and lumbar spine BMD; Supplemental Table 5, Sup-plemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857).However, creatine supplementation preserved a number of geo-metric properties at the proximal femur compared with placebo(i.e., sectional modulus and buckling ratio at the narrow part of the femoral neck, and cortical thickness, SPW, section modu- lus, and buckling ratio at the femoral shaft).
The preservationof section modulus and cortical thickness (in comparison with the decrease in the placebo group) would preserve strength inbending and compression, respectively, whereas the increasedbuckling ratio in the placebo group indicates an increasedsusceptibility of cortical bending under compressive loads(12,13). A decrease in SPW in the creatine group relative to the placebo group at the femoral shaft is also associated with reduced risk of fracture (12,13).Differences between groupsfor percentage of participants exceeding minimal differencesto be real supported a positive effect of creatine on geometricproperties at the narrow part of the femoral neck and femoralshaft (Table 2 and Supplemental Tables 3 and 6, SupplementalDigital Content, http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857) but notnecessarily at the intertroch anteric region (Supplemental Tables 3 and 6, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857).
Some differences at the intertrochantericregion indicated greater beneficial changes in the placebogroup (e.g., cortical thickness, CSA, CSMI, and section mod-ulus), and some indicated greater beneficial changes in the cre-atine group (e.g., SPW and buckling ratio) in the compliersanalysis (Supplemental Table 6, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857) . At the cellular level, creatine stimulates differentiation of osteoblasts (i.e., cells involved in bone formation) (5), but osteocl asts (cells involved in bone re- sorption) are also dependent on creatine kinase, the enzyme in-volved in breakdown of phosphocreatine (29), and thereforemight also be responsive to creatine supplementation.We spec-ulate that perhaps creatine supplementation stimulates remodel-ing of bone (i.e., both formation and resorption) to alter geomet-ric properties and whether formation or resorption predominates may depend on the location of bone in the proximal femur.
T h el a c ko fa ne f f e c to fc r e a t i n eo nB M Dd o e sn o ts u p p o r t our primary hypothesis, which was based on a smaller,shorter-duration study (i.e., 1 yr) in postmenopausal women,where we observed a significant preservation of BMD at thefemoral neck with creatine compared with placebo during asupervised resistance training program (9). Differences be-tween studies are likely not due to the dose of creatine, as it was higher in the current study.Characteristics of the women were similar across studies, as was the resistance training pro-gram; therefore, the difference between studies is most likelydue to the smaller sample size in our 1-yr study (and thereforea chance statistical finding) or perhaps to the higher compli- ance with the creatine supplement in the previous study (i.e.,79% vs 56% in the current study).
A lack of an effect of crea-tine (20 g·d −1for 5 d, 5 g·d−1for 23 wk) during supervised re- sistance training on hip or lumbar spine BMD in postmeno- pausal women was also observed in a shorter-duration study(i.e., 6 months) (30). Smaller doses of creatine supplementation(1–3g · d −1for 1–2 yr) without resistance training were also inef- fective for improving BMD in postmenopausal women (31,32).Collectively, creatine supplemen tation has a very minimal effect (if any) on BMD in postmenopausal women.In contrast to its lack of effect on BMD, creatine supple- mentation preserved several geometric measures at the proxi- mal femur in comparison with placebo, which could improvecompressive and bending strength of bone and reduce suscep-tibility to cortical buckling under compressive loads in the cre-atine compared with the placebo group (12,13).
Compared withplacebo, creatine supplementati on preserved section modulus and buckling ratio at the narrow part of the femoral neck, andcortical thickness, SPW, section modulus, and buckling ratio at the femoral shaft, all changes that are associated with de- creased hip fracture risk in pos tmenopausal women (12,13). The changes observed in our study are however most likely be-low the threshold for clinical prevention of fracture.For exam-ple, a 1 SD change in geometric properties such as femoral neckor shaft cortical thickness, section modulus, and buckling ratiois associated with significant cha nges in fracture risk in longitu- dinal assessment of older women (followed for approximately 13 yr) (33).Our changes in these variables were much less than 1 SD, indicating that a longer duration of creatine supplementa-tion would be necessary or that creatine supplementation mayneed to be combined with other therapies to significantly pre-vent fracture.
In our smaller, shorter-term st udies, we showed that 1 yr of creatine supplementa tion during supervised resis- tance training tended to increase ( P= 0.061) section modulus at the narrow part of the femoral neck in older men (14). Using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), we also found beneficial effects of creatine supplementation on bonegeometry (i.e., increased total area of bone at the distal and shaftsections of the tibia) during a resistance training program in postmenopausal women and older men (15).Mechanistically,creatine supplementation may activate cells involved in boneformation (i.e., osteoblasts) (5) or may reduce bone resorption(8,34).Creatine may especially be effective when combined with exercise because exercise s timulates creatine uptake into muscle (35), leading to increases in phosphocreatine stores, whichstimulates adenosine triphosphate resynthesis during short-term,high-intensity exercise, such as resistance training.
Creatinesupplementation is therefore more effective for increasing leantissue mass when combined with resistance training than cre-atine supplementation alone without training (30). Increasedlean mass may allow for increased mechanical stress on bone, stimulating a net bone formation, which may contribute to the improved geometric properties (36).Our study indicated a beneficial effect of creatine supple- mentation combined with supervised resistance training for http://www.acsm-msse.org 1758 Official Journal of the American College of Sports MedicineCLINICAL SCIENCES increasing lean tissue mass (in the valid-completers analysis) and walking speed but no effect above resistance trainingalone for improving hack squat or bench press strength.
Previ-ous meta-analyses show creatine supplementation combined with resistance training is more effective than resistance train- ing alone for improving lean tissue mass, strength (37 –39) and performance of functional tests (40,41) in older adults. Ourprevious study using pQCT indicated that creatine supplemen-tation during supervised resistance training improved musclequality (i.e., muscle density) of the lower limb (15), which ispredictive of performance of functional tasks (i.e., timed-up-and-go) in older women (42); this may contribute to the enhanced walking speed with creatine supplementation in the current study.Our finding of increased walking speedagrees with a recent study in stroke survivors that found an im-provement in 6-min walking distance from creatine supple-mentation and supervised resistance training (43).
The lackof change for strength measures with creatine supplementationin the current study may be due to the large beneficial effect ofresistance training alone on muscular strength, which may mask any small improvement due to creatine supplementation. Our hack squat strength measure is quite variable; this couldalso account for the difficulty in detecting any small effectdue to creatine supplementation.We included this exercise aspart of our training program, instead of leg press, which has alower coefficient of variation i n older adults (21), because we believe it provides a more direct stimulus to the hip area to im-prove bone status.Our previous studies indicated a lack of effect of leg press training on hip bone mineral (24) but a beneficial effect of hack squat training perhaps because of more directloading of the hip during the hack squat (18).
An important aspect of our study was that a relatively large dose of creatine over 2 yr resulted in minimal adverse events,including markers of kidney and liver function. This agreeswith previous studies of older women that had shorter durationand involved lower does (9,44).Many of the kidney-relatedadverse events in the creatine group were due to elevated blood creatinine levels or lower estimated glomerular filtration rate,which is estimated using level s of blood creatinine.Because creatinine is a metabolic by-produ ct of creatine degradation, it is not surprising that blood creatinine levels were sometimes el- evated, and this may not indicate kidney problems (45).A limitation of our study was the relatively low compliance with the creatine and placebo supplements, low compliance tothe exercise protocols, and high attrition rate.One contributingfactor for the low compliance with the supplements was theconservative approach we took when dealing with kidney orliver adverse events.
For example, if a participant experienced blood or urine markers of kidney or liver dysfunction outside the normal reference range, their supplement dosage was reduced. CONCLUSIONS In summary, 2 yr of creatine supplementation during a resis- tance training and walking program in postmenopausal womenhad no beneficial effects on BMD yet resulted in several im-provements in bone geometry at the proximal femur (i.e., in- creased cortical thickness and section modulus, and reduced SPW and buckling ratio).These changes may be protectiveagainst hip fracture.Longer-term follow-up with larger sam-ple sizes would be needed to confirm protection against hipfracture with creatine supplementation.The study received funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (funding reference number: 130235) and the Canada Foun-dation for Innovation.D.G.C.
