Previously,P. oligandrum has been studied for its plant growth-promoting potential by auxin produc- tion and induction of disease resistance by elicitors such as oligandrin.Volatile organic com-pounds (VOCs) play bene ﬁcial roles in sustainable agriculture by enhancing plant growth and resistance.We investigated the contribution of P.oligandrum -produced VOCs on plant growth and disease suppression by initially using Nicotiana benthamiana plants for screening.P.oligandrum VOCs signi ﬁcantly enhanced tobacco seedling and plant biomass contents.Screening of the individual VOCs showed that 3-octanone and hexa-decane promoted the growth of tobacco seedlings.The total VOCs from P.oligandrum also enhanced the shoot and root growth of ginger plants.Transcriptomic analysis showeda higher expression of genes related to plant growth hormones and stress responses inthe leaves of ginger plants exposed to P.oligandrum VOCs.
The concentrations of plant growth hormones such as auxin, zeatin, and gibberellic acid were higher in the leaves ofginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs.In a ginger disease biocontrol assay, the VOC-exposed ginger plants infected with P.myriotylum had lower levels of disease severity.We conclude that this study contributes to understanding the growth-promoting mecha-nisms of P.oligandrum on ginger and tobacco, priming of ginger plants against various stresses, and the mechanisms of action of P.oligandrum as a biocontrol agent.IMPORTANCE Plant growth promotion plays a vital role in enhancing production of agri- cultural crops, and Pythium oligandrum is known for its plant growth-promoting potential through production of auxins and induction of resistance by elicitors.This study highlightsthe signi ﬁcance of P.oligandrum -produced VOCs in plant growth promotion and disease resistance.Transcriptomic analyses of leaves of ginger plants exposed to P.
oligandrum VOCs revealed the upregulation of genes involved in plant growth hormone signaling and stressresponses. Moreover, the concentration of growth hormones signi ﬁcantly increased in P.oli- gandrum VOC-exposed ginger plants.Additionally, the disease severity was reduced in P.myriotylum -infected ginger plants exposed to P.oligandrum VOCs.In ginger, P.myrio- tylum -caused rhizome rot disease results in severe losses, and biocontrol has a role asEditor Lindsey Price Burbank, USDA —San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center Copyright © 2023 Sheikh et al.This is an open- access article distributed under the terms of theCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license .Address correspondence to Lihui Wei, weilihui@jaas.ac.cn, or Paul Daly,paul.daly@jaas.ac.cn.The authors declare a con ﬂict of interest.L.W.and D.Z.are co-authors on a patent application forP.oligandrum (Patent application number CN201910757035.2) relating to the biocontrolof plant diseases using the P.

KEYWORDS Pythium oligandrum , volatile organic compounds, ginger, Zingiber ofﬁcinale , transcriptomic analysis, plant growth promotion, Pythium myriotylum , disease severity Plant growth promotion by bene ﬁcial microorganisms is a well-studied phenomenon frequently linked to the production of microbial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and phytohormones (1 –4).Pythium oligandrum , a non-plant-pathogenic oomycete, has been studied for its antagonistic effects against plant pathogens (5, 6) as well as reported for its plant growth-promoting potential, either by the production of compounds such as auxins (7) or by induction of resistance through elicitors (8). Previously, P.oligandrum VOCs have been suggested to contribute to the growth inhibition of the plant pathogens Phoma medicaginis ,Mycosphaerella pinodes (9),Pythium ultimum , and Fusarium oxysporum (10).Moreover, we found that P.oligandrum -produced VOCs inhibit Pythium myriotylum (11).P.
myriotylum is a broad-host-range plant-pathogenic oomycete that causes a range of soilborne diseases, such as ginger soft rot disease (12 –14), damping-off of chili pepper (15), and crown and root rot of hemp (16). VOCs produced by antagonistic bacteria (1) and fungi (17) have been studied for their potential for plant growth promotion and regulation of hormone synthesis and nutrient transport (18 –2 0 ) .V O C sp r o d u c e db y Bacillus subtilis promoted Arabidopsis thaliana growth via the cytokinin signaling pathway (21) and by regulating the expression of 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA)-related genes (22).The VOC 2 R,3R-butanediol produced by Pseudomonas chlorora- phisO6 induced drought tolerance in A.thaliana through a salicylic acid (SA) signaling path- way-dependent mechanism by regulating stomatal opening and closing (23).Trichoderma asperellum VOCs promoted the growth of lettuce and induced resistance against Corynespora cassiicola andCurvularia aeria (17).
In Nicotiana benthamiana seedlings exposed to the VOCs produced by Microbacterium aurantiacum , there was upregulated expression of the key genes involved in auxin, ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid pathways (24). A volatile compound, tridecane, produced by Bacillus polymyxa E681 induced systemic resistance in Arabidopsis plants (25).Streptomyces spp.produce 3-octanone, which has been reported to enhance root growth in Arabidopsis (26).Hexadecane promoted plant growth and induced systemic resistance in Arabidopsis plants against Pectobacterium carotovorum andPseudomonas syringae (27).Oomycete diseases are among the most devastating plant diseases, causing losses of billions of dollars annually in agriculture (28, 29).P.myriotylum has been reported to cause diseases in a wide range of crops (30), including tobacco (31) and ginger (13).Pythium soft rot caused by P.myriotylum results in signi ﬁc a n tl o s s e si nc r o py i e l d s( 3 2 ,3 3 ) .A sw e l l asP.
oligandrum , other species of non-plant-pathogenic oomycetes have been reported as antagonists of fungal and oomycete plant pathogens and potential biocontrol agents. For example, Pythium nunn has been reported as a parasite of an oomycete plant pathogen, Pythium ultimum (34), and Pythium periplocum antagonized the fungal plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea (35).Studies have revealed that oomycete species belonging to the Phytophthora orPythium genus emit VOCs containing a diverse array of chemical groups, such as esters, alcohols, ketones, and alkenes.Interestingly, different plant-pathogenic Phytophthora species have been found to produce distinct sets of VOCs.For example, P.plurivora produces acetoin, 4-hydroxybutanoic acid, a-pinene, and D-3-carene, while P.cactorum produces acetone, dimethyl-disul ﬁde, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanone, and 2-octen-1-ol (36).For Pythium species, the microbial antagonist P.
oligan- drum has been reported in our previous study to produce a range of VOCs, including methyl heptenone, 2-undecanone, 3-octanone, octanal, and hexadecane (11). In our previous study, we demonstrated that P.oligandrum -produced VOCs could inhibit the growth of the ginger pathogen P.myriotylum.In this study, we aimed to investigate ifPo-VOCs Promote Plant Growth and Disease Resistance Microbiology Spectrum July/August 2023 Volume 11 Issue 4 10.1128/spectrum.01510-23 2 P.oligandrum VOCs could contribute to plant growth promotion and disease control apart from the previously reported auxin-mediated mechanism of growth promotion and elici-tor-induced disease resistance in plants.Initially, N.benthamiana was used to screen the e f f e c t sa sw e l la sf o rd e c o n v o l u t i n gt h et o t a lV O C s .W ef o u n ds u p p o r tf o rt h er o l eo f P.oligan- drum -produced VOCs in plant growth promotion and disease resistance.
Transcriptome and metabolite analyses suggested that ginger growth promotion was mediated by changes inhormone levels. RESULTS P.oligandrum volatile organic compounds enhanced seedling growth in N.benthami- ana in vitro .To initially investigate the growth promotion potential of P.oligandrum GAQ1 VOCs (Po-VOCs) on N.benthamiana seedlings, a bipartite petri plate was used to prevent dif- fusion of secreted growth-promoting compounds through the agar.After 10 days, therewere signi ﬁcant increases in shoot length (2.25-fold) and seedling dry weight (5.5-fold) in the seedlings exposed to Po-VOCs compared to the control (Fig.1A; see Fig.S1 in the sup-plemental material).Moreover, roots were scanned to analyze the morphology of the roots exposed to Po-VOCs (Fig.1B).
The root morphological parameters showed that there were signiﬁcant increases in the total root volume (3-fold), total number of root tips (2.6-fold), total root length (3-fold), and average root diameter (5-fold) of the seedlings exposed to Po-VOCs compared to the control (Fig. 1B).Exposure to P.oligandrum VOCs increased the growth of N.benthamiana in planta .In planta assays were performed to determine the growth-promoting potential of Po-VOCs inN.benthamiana plants.N.benthamiana plants were grown in the pots attached to the top of jars containing P.oligandrum to facilitate the exposure of the roots to P.oligandrum VOCs.The result showed that the N.benthamiana plants exposed to Po-VOCs for 21 days grew noticeably more than the control plants, suggesting that Po-VOCs positively in ﬂu- enced the growth of N.benthamiana (Fig.2A; Fig.S2).Moreover, considerable increases were observed in shoot length (1.4-fold) and dry weight (2.1-fold) of N.
benthamiana plants that were exposed to Po-VOCs compared to the control (Fig. 2A).Additionally, the effects FIG 1 P.oligandrum volatile organic compounds (Po-VOCs) enhanced the growth of Nicotiana benthamiana seedlings.(A) The plates were imaged 10 days after exposure to Po-VOCs or the control (V8), and shoot length and seedling dry weight were measured.(B) Representative images of the roots of N.benthamiana seedlings exposed to Po-VOCs or control (V8) for 10 days.The scale bar represents 2 cm.Four root morphological parameters, including total root volume, total number of root tips, total root length, and average root diameter, were measured.Erro r bars indicate the standard error of the mean ( n53).Different lowercase letters above the bars represent signi ﬁcant differences between treatments.Experiments were repeated twice with similar results, as shown in Fig.
S1.Po-VOCs Promote Plant Growth and Disease Resistance Microbiology Spectrum July/August 2023 Volume 11 Issue 4 10.1128/spectrum.01510-23 3 of Po-VOCs on the root morphology were investigated. The root images of N.benthamiana taken after 21 days of Po-VOC exposure showed that there was an increase in root growthin plants that were exposed to Po-VOCs.The roots of plants that were exposed to Po-VOCs demonstrated signi ﬁcant increases in root volume (2.5-fold), number of root tips (2.2-fold), total root length (2.2-fold), and average root diameter (3.5-fold) compared to the controlplants (Fig.2B).After 21 days of exposure to P.oligandrum VOCs, the expression levels of N.benthamiana genes related to growth were analyzed to see if the increased plant growth was associated with changes in gene expression.Our results showed that there was an increase in the expression of genes for expansin (5.2-fold in N.benthamiana NbEXPA1 a n d9 .

Different lowercase letters above the bars represent signi ﬁcant differences between treatments. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results, and the results of second and third repeats of experiment are shown in Fig.S2.Po-VOCs Promote Plant Growth and Disease Resistance Microbiology Spectrum July/August 2023 Volume 11 Issue 4 10.1128/spectrum.01510-23 4 exposed to Po-VOC compared to the control (Fig.2C).The expansins play a role in cell expan- sion, elongation, and growth.NbGA14 is regulated by a plant hormone, gibberellin, with higher expression in plants with enhanced growth.Overall, we found that N.benthamiana i nt h ep r e s e n c eo fP o - V O C sh a das i g n i ﬁcant increase in the expression of growth-related genes and biomass content.After screening the potential of P.oligandrum -produced VOCs onN.benthamiana growth, we studied the growth-promoting potential of these VOCs on ginger.P.oligandrum VOCs enhanced the growth in ginger plants.
In an in planta assay, the growth-promoting potential of Po-VOCs on ginger plants was evaluated after 21 days. The results showed signi ﬁcant increases in shoot length (2-fold) and plant dry weight (3.3-fold) of Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants compared to the control (Fig.3A; Fig.S3).Additionally, the rootimages of ginger taken after 21 days of Po-VOC exposure showed increased root growth.The root morphological parameters showed that there were signi ﬁcant increases in root volume (1.5-fold), number of root tips (2.3-fold), total root length (2.5-fold), and average root diameter(1.5-fold) in the plants that were exposed to the VOCs produced by P.oligandrum compared to the control plants (Fig.3B).These results demonstrated that exposure to Po-VOCs increasedthe growth of ginger plants.Interestingly, the trend regarding which of the rhizoscanner measurements had a bigger fold change (FC) increase differed between N.benthamiana and ginger.In N.
benthami- ana, the FC increases for root diameter (3.5-fold) and volume (2.5-fold) were larger than those for root length (2.2-fold) and number of root tips (2.2-fold) (Fig. 2).In ginger, the FC increasesfor root length (2.5-fold) and number of root tips (2.3-fold) were larger than those for root di-ameter (1.5-fold) and root volume (1.5-fold) (Fig.3).P.oligandrum VOCs led to expression changes in ginger genes related to growth and defense.To gain insight into the mechanism on how P.oligandrum VOCs lead to the enhancement of plant growth in ginger, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was performed.Ginger leaves were sampled after 21 days of Po-VOC exposure and FIG 3 Volatile organic compounds produced by P.oligandrum enhanced the growth of ginger ( Zingiber of ﬁcinale )p l a n t s .( A )T h ep l a n t sw e r e imaged 21 days after exposure to Po-VOCs or the control (V8) to see the difference in growth by measuring the shoot length and dry weight of the plants.

Root morphological parameters, including total root volume, the total number of root tips, total root length,and average root diameter, were measured.Error bars indicate the standard error ( n53).Different lowercase letters above the bars represent signi ﬁcant differences between treatments.Experiments were repeated three times with similar results, and the results of the second and third repeats of the experiment are shown in Fig.S3.Po-VOCs Promote Plant Growth and Disease Resistance Microbiology Spectrum July/August 2023 Volume 11 Issue 4 10.1128/spectrum.01510-23 5 compared to those of the ginger plants grown in the absence of Po-VOCs.Principal-compo- nent analysis (PCA) showed a clear separation between the three ginger plants that were exposed to Po-VOCs and the three control ginger plants grown without exposure to Po- VOCs (Fig.4A).
In terms of the numbers of differentially expressed genes (adjusted Pvalue [Padj],,0.05; fold change [FC], .2; fragments per kilobase per million [FPKM], .1), there were 1,661 genes upregulated and 1,404 genes were downregulated (Fig. 4B).The transcriptomic data were analyzed for the functions of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on Pfam domains that were used for functional annotation of ginger genes (see Table S2 in the supplemental material).The ginger genome contains at least 141 genes annotated with the Pfam domain for the auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (AUX/IAA) family(PF02309).The transcription of genes belonging to the AUX/IAA family can be upregulated by the plant hormone auxin (37).A substantial proportion (38/43) of DEGs annotated with this Pfam domain were upregulated with an average of 9-fold in the leaves of ginger plants exposed to Po-VOCs (Table S2B).
Out of 21 genes annotated with a Pfam domain for cytokinin dehydrogenase 1 (CKX1), ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and cytokinin binding domain (PF09265), all six of the DEGs were upregulated with an average of 8.8-fold change (Table S2B). The cytokinin binding domain binds cytokinin and starts a signaling cascade that regulates cell division and differentiation (38).Proteins with the GRAS (gibberellic acidinsensitive [GAI], repressor of GA1-3 [RGA], and Scarecrow [SCR]) domain family (PF03514) c a nb ei n v o l v e di np l a n tg r o w t h( 3 9 )a n dc a nb eu p r e g u l a t e db yt h ee n d o g e n o u sp r o d u c - tion of GA3 (40).
There were at least 132 genes annotated with this domain family in the ginger genome, and most (19/22) of the DEGs were upregulated, with an average of FIG 4 (A) Principal-component analysis (PCA) of the six ginger ( Zingiber of ﬁcinale ) transcriptome samples showing a clear separation between ginger plants either exposed to Po-VOCs or the control (V8).

There were at least 79 genes annotated with the expansin C-terminal domain (PF01357) in the ginger genome, and 13 out of 18 DEGs were upregulated, with an average of 17-fold in the Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants (Table S2B). Expansin can function to bind and loosen the cellulose micro ﬁbrils in the plant cell wall, allowing for the expansion and growth of the cell (41).Transcriptomic data showed that in Po-VOC-exposed plants, there was an upregulation of genes that are potentially involved in regulating stress responses (Table S2B).The Myb andWRKY genes can be involved in the regulation of defense and stress responses (42, 43).In VOC-exposed ginger plants, out of at least 308 genes annotated with Pfam for the WRKY DNA-binding domain (PF03106), 37/53 DEGs were upregulated, with an average of 13-fold change in expression.
The genome showed that there were at least 47 genes annotatedwith the Pfams for both the Myb-like DNA-binding domain (PF00249) and MYB-CC-type transfactor LHEQLE motif (PF14379). All of the DEGs were signi ﬁcantly upregulated (10/10), with an average of 6.4-fold in Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants compared to the control (Table S2B).The AP2 domain (PF00847) is a protein domain found in transcription factors im- portant in regulating gene expression in plants in response to stress (44).The genome showed that there were at least 486 genes annotated with the Pfam domain for AP2 and 43 out of 57 DEGs annotated with this domain were signi ﬁcantly upregulated, with an average of 9.5-fold in the Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants (Table S2).The expression levels of repre- sentative genes from the above-described Pfam domains are shown in Fig.4C.These repre- sentative genes were also selected for validation of the RNA-seq data set by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and are shown in Fig.
S4, which showed the same trends in expression shown in Fig. 4C.The concentration of ginger growth hormones increased in the presence of P.oligandrum VOCs.Growth hormones were selected for quanti ﬁcation in ginger leaf blades based on the upregulation of genes related to these hormones.Overall, our results showed that exposure to Po-VOCs increased the concentration of plant growth-related hor- mones in ginger.There was a signi ﬁcant increase in hormone concentration in leaf blades a f t e r7 ,1 4 ,a n d2 1d a y so fP o - V O C - e x p o s e dg i n g e rp l a n t sc o m p a r e dt ot h ec o n t r o l .T h ec o n - centration of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was increased signi ﬁcantly by 2.5-fold after 7 days a n d3 - f o l da f t e r1 4a n d2 1d a y si ng i n g e rp l a n t se x p o s e dt oP o - V O C sc o m p a r e dt ot h e i rc o n - trols (Fig.5; Fig.S5).
The concentration of zeatin (ZEA) increased signi ﬁcantly in Po-VOCs exposed ginger plants by 6-fold after 7, 14, and 21 days, whereas the concentration of gib-berellic acid (GA3) increased by 4.3-fold after 7 days, 5.4-fold after 14 days, and 8-fold after 21 days of Po-VOC exposure (Fig. 5).The concentration of abscisic acid (ABA) was increased in Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants by 1.5-fold after 7 days and 1.7-fold after 14 days whereas at 21 days, the concentration was 3-fold lower than that of the control plants (Fig.5).The lower concentration of ABA at 21 days was in contrast to the consistent increases in IAA, ZEA, and GA3 across all three time points in Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants.Individual VOCs 3-octanone and hexadecane identi ﬁed by GC-MS enhanced N.benthamiana growth.Twelve P.
oligandrum GAQ1-produced VOCs (which had a relative percentage of area of .1% in the gas chromatagraphy-mass spectrometry [GC-MS] chromato- gram) identi ﬁed from our previous study (11) were tested individually for their plant growth- promoting ability by measuring seedling dry weight. Out of 12 VOCs, only two, hexadecane and 3-octanone, resulted in increased N.benthamiana seedling growth (Fig.S6).Although there was no increase in growth from the other 10 VOCs, they at least did not signi ﬁcantly reduce the seedling dry weight (Fig.S6).Both hexadecane and 3-octanone increased N.ben- thamiana seedling growth more at a concentration of 50 mMt h a na t1 0 mM, with maximum increases in dry weight of 2.7-fold for hexadecane and 3-fold for 3-octanone (Fig.6; Fig.S7).Both hexadecane and 3-octanone were later analyzed at 100 mM, where for hexadecane, the dry weight of the seedlings was not signi ﬁcantly higher than the 50 mMc o n c e n t r a t i o n .
However, at 100 mM concentration of 3-octanone, the dry weight of the seedlings was sig- niﬁcantly lower than the 50 mM concentration (Fig. 6).GC-MS analysis was conducted to identify whether the two growth-promoting VOCs hexadecane and 3-octanone produced by P.oligandrum GAQ1 were also produced byP.oligandrum strain CBS 530.74.Our results showed that the P.oligandrum strainPo-VOCs Promote Plant Growth and Disease Resistance Microbiology Spectrum July/August 2023 Volume 11 Issue 4 10.1128/spectrum.01510-23 7 CBS 530.74 produced hexadecane, whereas 3-octanone was not detected (Table S3 and Fig.S8).Moreover, the GC-MS chromatograph of P.myriotylum SWQ7 showed that both hexadecane and 3-octanone were not detected and standards were alsoused to con ﬁrm the identity of both VOCs (Fig.S8).FIG 5 Concentrations of selected plant growth hormones in leaf blades of ginger plants exposed to P.oligandrum volatile organic compounds for 7, 14, and 21 days.

oligandrum VOCs reduced disease symptoms in ginger plants. To demonstrate the effect of P.oligandrum -produced VOCs on the disease severity in ginger, the plants infected with the soft rot pathogen P.myriotylum were exposed to P.oligandrum VOCs.After 21 days of exposure to Po-VOCs, the plants were photographed, and the diseaseseverity index was calculated.Our results showed that 75% disease severity was observedin the P.myriotylum -infected ginger plants without VOC exposure, while those exposed to P.oligandrum VOCs had a much lower disease severity index of 15% (Fig.7; Fig.S9).P.myrio- tylum -infected N.benthamiana plants were also evaluated for the development of disease in the presence and absence of VOCs produced by P.oligandrum .P.myriotylum -infected N.ben- thamiana plants without VOC exposure showed wilting symptoms, with a wilt index of 78%; however, the wilt index was reduced to low as 22% in plants that were exposed to Po-VOCs(Fig.7).
These results demonstrated that Po-VOCs could reduce the disease severity in gingerandN. benthamiana plants infected with P.myriotylum .DISCUSSION P.oligandrum has been reported to promote growth (7, 45) and induce systemic resist- ance in plants (46 –48).Previous studies have demonstrated that P.oligandrum promotes plant growth by producing tryptamine (TNH 2), an auxin-like compound (7, 49), and induces systemic resistance by microbe-associated molecular patterns (8, 50, 51).However, the roleofP.oligandrum VOCs in plant growth promotion and induction of disease resistance has not yet been studied.Here, we show that the production of VOCs by P.oligandrum could be another factor in P.oligandrum -mediated plant growth promotion and disease resistance.In the present study, we observed an increase in the growth of N.benthamiana seedlings FIG 7 P.oligandrum VOCs reduced the disease severity in N.benthamiana and ginger plants.(A) P.myriotylum -infected N.
benthamiana plants were exposed to either the control (V8) or Po-VOCs for 21 days, whereas the noninoculated N. benthamiana plants without exposure to Po-VOCs were used as negative controls.The plants were photographed, and the symptoms were scored after 21 days of inoculation of P.myriotylum and exposure to Po-VOCs to calculate the percentage of wilting in N.benthamiana .(B) P.myriotylum -infected ginger plants were exposed to either Po-VOCs or the control (V8) for 21 days, whereas the noninoculated ginger plants without exposure to Po-VOCs wereused as negative controls.The plants were photographed, and the symptoms were scored after 21 days of inoculation of P.myriotylum and exposure to Po-VOCs to calculate the disease severity index in ginger.Error bars are the standard error of the mean ( n520).Lowercase letters on the bars show signi ﬁcant differences between different treatments.
The experiment was repeated twice with similar results, and the results from the second repeat of the experiment are shown in Fig. S9.Po-VOCs Promote Plant Growth and Disease Resistance Microbiology Spectrum July/August 2023 Volume 11 Issue 4 10.1128/spectrum.01510-23 9 and plants exposed to Po-VOCs.VOCs produced by B.subtilis (1),Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens (52), and Trichoderma spp.(53) have been reported to enhance plant growth.In N.ben- thamiana plants exposed to Po-VOCs, the increased growth was positively correlated with the signi ﬁcant upregulation in the expression of the expansin genes NbEXPA1 andNbEXPA2 (Fig.2C).B.subtilis VOCs have been shown to upregulate the expression of expansin genes inNicotiana tabacum (1).Previous studies showed that the expression level of NbEXPA1 was signiﬁcantly higher in N.benthamiana plants with enhanced growth (54).Exposure to Po- VOCs resulted in signi ﬁcantly higher expression of a gibberellin-regulated protein encoded byNbGA14 .I nN.
benthamiana mutants where genes from the GA signaling pathway were deleted, the relative expression level of NbGA14 w a sl o w ,i m p l i c a t i n g NbGA14 as GA respon- sive (55). Our results from N.benthamiana are in line with how exposure to VOCs produced byM.aurantiacum enhanced the growth of N.benthamiana through auxin and gibberellin pathways (24).Microbial VOCs have been shown to increase growth and induce systemic resistance in plants, including A.thaliana (56, 57) and tobacco (24).Here, we used ginger after screening the potential of Po-VOCs for N.benthamiana growth enhancement and demonstrated that growth was also increased in Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants.Transcriptomic analysis of the ginger leaves suggested that exposure to Po-VOCs modulates hormone signal trans- duction in ginger involving auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins.
A substantial number of genes annotated with the Pfam domain for the AUX/IAA family (PF02309) were upregu- l a t e di nP o - V O C - e x p o s e dg i n g e rp l a n t s .T h ep l a n th o r m o n ea u x i nc a nt r i g g e rt h et r a n s c r i p - tion of genes belonging to the AUX/IAA family (58). Auxin plays a critical role in the regula- tion of various aspects of plant growth and development, particularly root growth (59).The enhanced growth in Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants can positively be correlated with the increased concentration of the auxin IAA.Zeatin is a plant cytokinin that is primarilysynthesized in the roots and transported to other parts of the plant, where it can promote shoot and leaf growth (60).In Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants, an increased concentration of zeatin was positively correlated with the enhanced shoot and root growth.
In Po-VOC- exposed ginger, there was upregulation of the genes that were annotated with a Pfam do- main for cytokinin dehydrogenase 1, FAD, and cytokinin binding (PF09265), which could potentially be involved in maintaining cytokinin homeostasis in Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants. Cytokinin dehydrogenase genes can regulate cytokinin homeostasis to maintain bal- anced hormone levels such as in rice (61).Gibberellin (GA) signaling controls a variety of plant growth and development characteristics and is primarily regulated by proteins in the GRASdomain family (PF03514) (62, 63).In Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants, there was signi ﬁcant upregulation of genes annotated with a Pfam domain for the GRAS family, which could potentially be involved in GA signaling in Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants.
In addition, the increased concentration of endogenous GA3 in Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants could positively be correlated with increased growth as it has been reported that endogenous GA3 in Arabidopsis upregulates the expression of genes in the GRAS domain family (40). Previously it has been demonstrated that spraying GA increased the shoot length of ginger and weight of ginger rhizome (64).Similarly, the yield of ginger rhizomes was signi ﬁcantly increased by the application of GA3 (65, 66).In Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants, there was anupregulation in the expression of genes annotated with the Pfam domain for expansin C-terminal domain (PF01357), which can positively correlate with the growth enhancement in Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants as expansin proteins are involved in cell expansion and elongation (67).Transcriptomic analysis showed that exposure to Po-VOCs upregulated genes related to various stress responses.
A signi ﬁcant proportion of the putative genes annotated with the Pfam domains for the WRKY DNA-binding domain (PF03106), Myb-like DNA-binding domain (PF00249) and MYB-CC type transfactor LHEQLE motif (PF14379), and AP2 domain (PF00847) were upregulated. WRKY transcription factors can be important for the regulation of genes associated with plant defense responses.Our results showed that genes annotatedwith the Pfam domain for the WRKY DNA-binding domain were upregulated in Po-VOC- exposed ginger plants.Previously, the overexpression of Vitis vinifera WRKY2 ( VvWRKY2 )i nPo-VOCs Promote Plant Growth and Disease Resistance Microbiology Spectrum July/August 2023 Volume 11 Issue 4 10.1128/spectrum.01510-23 10 tobacco was shown to enhance resistance against Pythium spp.(68).It has been shown that Zingiber of ﬁcinale WRKY8 ( ZoWRKY8 ) was upregulated in ginger plants infected with Fusarium oxysporum (69).
In ginger exposed to Po-VOCs, the upregulation of genes anno- tated with the Pfam database for both the Myb-like DNA-binding domain (PF00249) and MYB-CC type transfactor LHEQLE motif (PF14379) suggested that exposure to Po-VOCscould be related to stress responses. Previously, it has been reported that ZoMYB transcrip- tion factors were upregulated in abiotically stressed ginger (70).In Po-VOC-exposed ginger plants, the upregulated genes annotated with the Pfam database for AP2 (PF00847) could be involved in priming ginger plants for resistance to abiotic stresses.Previously, gingergenes annotated with the AP2 domain were upregulated under abiotic stresses (71).Individual VOCs produced by P.oligandrum , reported in our previous study (11), were tested for plant growth promotion.Out of 12 VOCs, two VOCs, hexadecane and 3-octanone, signiﬁcantly enhanced the growth of N.benthamiana seedlings.Previously, hexadecane has been shown to increase Arabidopsis growth (27).
Interestingly, the growth promotion by 3-octanone was less at a higher concentration, where at 100 mM, the dry weight was sig- niﬁcantly lower than at 50 mM (Fig. 6).It has previously been demonstrated that much higher 3-octanone ( ;5 mM) concentrations than those used in our study decreased growth inArabidopsis (72).There was a reduction in disease severity in P.myriotylum -infected ginger plants that were exposed to Po-VOCs compared to nonexposed ginger plants.In our previous study, we demonstrated that VOCs produced by P.oligandrum inhibited the growth of P.myrioty- lum(11), which could be one of the potential contributions of Po-VOCs to disease control in ginger.Previous studies showed that VOCs produced by biocontrol Bacillus spp.resulted in disease control via inhibition of plant-pathogenic Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (73).Similarly, the exposure of tobacco plants to VOCs produced by B.
subtilis enhanced the resistance against bacterial wilt disease and reduced disease severity via inhibition of Ralstonia sola- nacearum (74). In our study, GC-MS analysis showed that the two growth-promoting VOCs (3-octanone and hexadecane) could not be detected from P.myriotylum growing on V8 medium, indicating that the two VOCs are probably produced by only P.oligandrum in the disease biocontrol experiment.Regarding biocontrol applications, our results demon-strated that Po-VOCs enhanced growth and reduced disease severity in ginger plants.Commercial P.oligandrum products, such as Polyversum, are already available and recom- mended for use in various crops for disease control (75).Based on our ﬁnding that P.oli- gandrum produces plant growth-promoting VOCs, the application of P.oligandrum bio- control products could be enhanced.
However, commercial strains should be tested to determine whether they produce growth-promoting VOCs, or the strain used in our study c a nb eu s e dt od e v e l o pac o m m e r c i a lp r o d u c t . In conclusion, the data presented in our study demonstrated that VOCs produced byP.oligandrum promoted the growth of N.benthamiana and ginger.Transcriptomic analysis showed that exposure to Po-VOCs induced the differential expression of puta- tive ginger genes for growth promotion, resistance, and hormone signaling.Theincreased hormone concentrations in the leaves of ginger further suggested theinvolvement of hormones in signaling pathways important for VOC-mediated growth promotion and reduction of disease severity in ginger.Overall, our ﬁndings provide new insights into the potential of P.oligandrum in VOC-mediated plant growth promo- tion and induction of disease resistance in plants.MATERIALS AND METHODS Pythium strains, plant material, and growth conditions.The P.
oligandrum strain GAQ1 (CGMCC no. 17470) was described previously for its biocontrol activity (5, 76).The P.myriotylum strain SWQ7 CGMCC no.21459 was described previously (13) as a pathogen causing Pythium soft rot disease of ginger.The biocontrol P.oligandrum strain CBS 530.74 was described previously (77).All of the strains were grown on 10% V8 agar medium at 25°C.Ginger plants ( “Laiwu ”variety) were derived from tissue culture, transplanted to autoclaved vermiculite in 100-mL pots, and grown in 16-h-light and 8-h-dark cycles at 25°C in a growth chamber.N.ben- thamiana plants were grown from seeds that were surface sterilized by soaking in 70% ethanol for 1 min, fol- lowed by soaking in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 15 min, rinsed four to ﬁve times in sterile distilled water, and dried on a ﬁlter paper.
The seeds were then placed in a growth chamber in 16-h-light and 8-h-darkPo-VOCs Promote Plant Growth and Disease Resistance Microbiology Spectrum July/August 2023 Volume 11 Issue 4 10.1128/spectrum.01510-23 11 cycles at 25°C. Young seedlings were then transplanted into plastic pots (one seedling per pot) and grown under the growth conditions described above.Effect of P.oligandrum VOCs on N.benthamiana seedling growth in vitro .To investigate the effect of VOCs produced by P.oligandrum on seedling growth, ﬁveN.benthamiana seedlings of equal size were placed on one side of a bipartite petri plate containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (0.8% agar,1.5% sucrose [pH 5.7]), a 5-mm mycelial plug of actively growing P.oligandrum was placed on the other side of the petri plate containing V8 agar medium, and the plates without P.oligandrum were used as a control.
The petri plates were sealed by wrapping them at least nine times with Para ﬁlm (Para ﬁlm M; Bemis, USA) to avoid the escape of VOCs and placed in an environmentally controlled chamber with 16-h-light and 8-h-dark cycles at 25°C. The seedling shoot length and dry weight were measured after 10 days.To measure the dryweight, plant material was dried in an oven until it reached a constant weight, which indicated that all mois-ture was removed.The experiment was repeated three times, each time with three replicates, and each repli-cate included ﬁve seedlings.Root morphological parameters were measured using a RhizoScan scanner (Epson Perfection V700 Photo; Epson, USA) and analyzed by WinRHIZO software (Regent Instruments Co.,Canada) (78).Effect of P.oligandrum VOCs on plant growth in N.benthamiana and ginger.The effect of P.oligan- drum GAQ1 VOCs (Po-VOCs) on N.
benthamiana and ginger in planta was evaluated by the method described previously (52), and a diagram illustrating the pot-jar assembly used in our study is shown in Fig. S10 in thesupplemental material.Glass jars containing V8 agar medium were inoculated with a 5-mm actively growingmycelial plug of P.oligandrum , whereas the noninoculated glass jars containing only V8 medium were used as a control.Six small 2-mm holes were made at the bottom of the plastic pots (270 mL) to allow the roots to be exposed to the VOCs produced by P.oligandrum .Two sterilized ﬁlter paper pieces (catalog no.99-102-150; Cytiva, USA) were placed inside the bottom of the plastic pot to avoid the leakage of contaminating liquidthrough the holes into the glass jar.Equal-sized N.benthamiana or ginger seedlings (one in each pot) were transferred to the plastic pots containing sterilized vermiculite and organic matter (3:1) and placed on the glassjars containing either P.
oligandrum or only V8 agar medium as control. The pot-jar assembly was then ﬁrmly sealed by wrapping it at least nine times with para ﬁlm (Para ﬁlm M; Bemis, USA) to avoid the escape of VOCs produced by P.oligandrum .The pot-jar assembly was then subjected to 16-h-light and 8-h-dark cycles at 25°C and watered with sprayer.Plants were watered by wetting the surface of the soil to avoid contamination byleakage of water through holes into the glass jar.Plants were grown for 21 days, and growth was evaluated bythe difference in shoot lengths (from the base of the stem to the top of the straightened leaves), dry weightsof the whole plant, and root morphological parameters.Leaf material was collected and frozen at 280°C for subsequent analysis of gene expression and hormone levels.For the gene expression and hormone analyses,separate experiments were performed.
Three biological replicate leaf samples were collected for each treat- ment: i.e., three biological replicate samples for VOC-exposed plants and three biological replicate samples for nonexposed (control) plants. Experimental design, RNA extraction, RNA-seq, and analysis.For transcriptome analysis, the gin- ger plants were grown as described in the previous section.The leaf blades from the two uppermostleaves of the plants grown for 21 days with and without exposure to Po-VOCs were collected from a sep- arate experiment from that used for hormone analysis, ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 280°C.For the RNA sequencing analysis, three biological replicate samples were collected for VOC- exposed and nonexposed (control) plants.Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent accordingto the manufacturer ’s protocol.
RNA purity and quantity were evaluated using the NanoDrop 2000 spec- trophotometer (Thermo Scienti ﬁc, USA), and the parameter to check the quality of RNA samples included measuring the absorbances of A 260/280 and A260/230 , whereby for all the samples, A260/280 was greater than 2.0 and A260/230 was greater than 1.8, and RNA integrity was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The libraries were constructed using the TruSeq stranded mRNA LT sample prep kit (Illumina, USA) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions.The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X 10 platform, and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated.Raw data (raw reads) of fastq format were ﬁrst processed using Trimmomatic (79), and the low-quality reads were removed to obtain the clean reads.
The clean reads were mapped to the Zingiber of ﬁcinale reference genome ( GCF_018446385 .1_Zo_v1.1_genomic.fna) (80 ) using HISAT2 (81), and .90% of the reads were mapped to the genome from all of the samples. The number of fragments per kilobase of gene model per million mapped reads (FPKM) (82) of each gene was calculated using Cuf ﬂinks (83), and the read counts of each gene were obtained by HTSeq-count (84), where the GFF ﬁleGCF_018446385 .1_Zo_v1.1_genomic.gff was used for the gene annotations.Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (85 ).An adjusted Pvalue (Padj)o f,0.05, fold change (FC) of .2o r,0.5, and an FPKM of .1 in the up- or downregulated genes were set as the threshold for signi ﬁcantly differential expression.The PCA was performed using the R statistical envi- ronment.
The ginger proteins were annotated with Pfam domains using the InterProScan functional annota- tion tool (Galaxy version 5.55 –88.01galaxy3) using the default settings at https://usegalaxy.eu (86–88). The ginger protein sequences were downloaded from NCBI using the GCF_018446385 .1_Zo_v1.1_protein.fasta ﬁle from reference 80 .Real-time PCR analysis of N.benthamiana and ginger gene expression.The expression in N.ben- thamiana leaves of genes annotated as encoding expansins ( NbEXPA1 andNbEXPA2 ) and gibberellin-regulated protein ( NbGA14 ) was measured.Expansin genes NbEXPA1 and NbEXPA2 were ampli ﬁed using primers from references 1 and 54, and the NbGA14 gene was ampli ﬁed using primers from reference 55.The details of the primers are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material.N.benthamiana leaves (excluding the petiole) were harvested from plants after 21 days of exposure to Po-VOCs, and the plants without VOC exposure served asthe control.
The qPCR validation for the ginger RNA-seq was performed using the same RNA samples used forRNA-seq. cDNA was synthesized using the EasyScript one-step genomic DNA (gDNA) removal and cDNAPo-VOCs Promote Plant Growth and Disease Resistance Microbiology Spectrum July/August 2023 Volume 11 Issue 4 10.1128/spectrum.01510-23 12 synthesis kit (TransGen Biotech), using random primers according to the manufacturer ’si n s t r u c t i o n s .T h eq P C R was performed with a LightCycler 96 instrument (Roche Life Sciences, USA) using SYBR green Pro TaqHS pre- mix (Accurate Biotechnology, China) with NbEF-1 a(89) and ZoEF-1 a(90) as an internal reference.The quantita- tive reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) program consisted of denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 ampli ﬁcation cycles at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 30 s.A melt curve analysis step was included to con ﬁrm the speci ﬁcity of the primer pairs used.
Each sample was replicated three times for qPCR, the data were analyzed using the LightCycler 96 software, and the relative expression was calculated by the threshold cycle (2244 CT) method (91). For ginger, the primers were designed using Primer-BLAST software (92) at NCBI and are listed in Table S1.Quanti ﬁcation of growth hormones in ginger plants exposed to P.oligandrum VOCs.Ginger plants exposed to Po-VOCs were analyzed for the concentrations of the plant growth-regulating hor- mones gibberellic acid (GA3), indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), zeatin (ZEA), and abscisic acid (ABA).Leaf blades were collected at three time points of 7, 14, and 21 days from both Po-VOC-exposed and nonexposed ginger plants (grown as described in the previous section).For the extraction of the hormones, 0.1 g of fresh (not dried) leaf blades from each treatment was ground to a ﬁne powder using a TissueLyser (60 s at 50 Hz).
The ﬁne leaf pow- der was then used to prepare the samples for hormone quanti ﬁcation based on a method described previ- ously (93). Brie ﬂy, the powder was extracted with 1 mL of 80% methanol in a 2-mL tube by shaking at 300 rpm overnight at 4°C.The extracted samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4°C for30 min.The supernatant from the samples was transferred to a new tube and then dried by vacuum evapora- tion at room temperature for 6 h, and then 200 mL of 80% methanol was added to the dried samples to dis- solve the extract and then passed through a 0.2- mm-pore-size ﬁlter.
The standard chemicals were purchased from Macklin, China for each of the quanti ﬁed hormones (IAA, GA3, ZEA, and ABA) and standard solutions of different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 2, 5, 20, 50, and 200 ng/mL) were prepared in 80% methanol as described previously (93), and samples were run on a Xevo TQ-S (Waters, USA) machine coupled with the Waters Acquity HSS T3 ultraperformance (UPLC) column (1.8 mm, 2.1 mm by 75 mm) with an injection volume of 2 mLa tac o l - umn temperature of 30°C for detection and quanti ﬁcation (94). Effect of individual VOCs on N.benthamiana seedling growth.The P.oligandrum VOCs identi ﬁed through previous GC-MS analysis based on their relative percentage of area of .1% (11) were evaluated using the individual compounds purchased from Macklin (China) or Aladdin (China) for their N.ben- thamiana seedling growth-promoting potential.
The 12 compounds were methyl heptenone, 3-octa- none, ethyl decanoate, 1-octanal, a-pinene, D-limonene, dodecane, 2-undecanone, 2-heptanone, pinane- diol, hexadecane, and 2-phenylethanol. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as a solvent to obtain ﬁnal concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 mM.N.benthamiana seedlings were grown on MS agar medium on one side of the bipartite plate as described in the previous section, and on the other side of the plate, 50 mL of each of the VOCs was applied to 1-cm-diameter ﬁlter papers.Control plates were prepared in the same manner, except the ﬁlter papers were wetted with only DMSO.After 10 days of VOC exposure, the dry weight of the seedlings was measured.GC-MS analysis of the VOCs produced by P.oligandrum and P.myriotylum .Solid-phase microex- traction (SPME) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was conducted to identify VOCs pro- duced by P.oligandrum strains GAQ1 and CBS 530.74 and P.myriotylum strain SWQ7.
Five-millimeter-diameter mycelial plugs from an actively growing mycelial mat of either P. oligandrum (GAQ1, CBS 530.74) or P.myrioty- lumSWQ7 was inoculated on V8 agar medium in 100-mL vials.Noninoculated V8 agar medium was used as a control.The absence of a VOC from the noninoculated V8 agar medium control was critical to assigning a VOC as actually produced by P.oligandrum orP.myriotylum .The vials were closed with rubber lids and were ﬁrmly sealed by wrapping them at least nine times with para ﬁlm (Para ﬁlm M; Bemis, USA), and then the vials were incubated at 25°C for 3 days before VOC collection.The SPME ﬁber was injected into the headspace of the vial containing either P.oligandrum GAQ1 or CBS 530.74 or P.myriotylum SWQ7 and incubated at 30°C for 30 min.GC-MS analysis was carried out using a TSQ 8000 EVO gas chromatograph (Thermo Scienti ﬁc, USA), and VOCs were identi ﬁed as described in reference 95.
Standards for hexadecane and 3-octanone (Macklin, China) were also run on the GC-MS machine. Effect of P.oligandrum VOCs on control of P.myriotylum -caused disease on ginger and N.ben- thamiana .The 5-mm freshly growing mycelial plug of P.oligandrum GAQ1 was inoculated in the glass jars containing V8 agar medium, while the glass jars containing only V8 agar medium were used as the control.The plastic pots were prepared as described in the previous section.The roots were inoculated with autoclaved wheat seeds, which were used to culture P.myriotylum SWQ7 isolate or controls at the same time as transplan- tation of equal-sized seedlings of either N.benthamiana or ginger.The wheat seed inoculum was prepared by the method described previously (5).The plastic pots inoculated with P.myriotylum , and noninoculated controls were then ﬁxed onto glass jars containing P.oligandrum and other glass jars containing only V8.
The glass jars were then sealed by wrapping them at least nine times with Para ﬁlm to avoid the escape of VOCs. The trial was carried out in a growth chamber at 16-h-light and 8-h-dark cycles at 25°C.Plants were observed regularly for the development of disease symptoms.The experiment was performed using a completely randomized design with 20 replicate plants in each experiment and repeated three times.The disease symptoms were scored 21 days after P.myriotylum inoculation using the formula disease severity index (%) 5[R(ni/C2vi)/(V/C2N)]/C2100, where niindicates the number of plants with the respective disease rating, viis the disease rating, Vis the high- est disease rating (3), and Nis the number of plants observed.The ginger disease rating was calculated using the following scale described in reference 32: 0 5healthy plants; 1 5discolored sheath collar and yellow lower leaves; 2 5plants alive, but with some shoots either totally yellow or dead; and 3 5all shoots dead.The N.
benthamiana wilting rating was calculated using the following scale: 1 5no symptoms, 2 5one leaf wilted, 3 5two to three leaves wilted, 4 5four or more leaves wilted, and 5 5whole plant wilted.Po-VOCs Promote Plant Growth and Disease Resistance Microbiology Spectrum July/August 2023 Volume 11 Issue 4 10.1128/spectrum.01510-23 13 Statistical analysis.
