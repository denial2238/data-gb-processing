Vitamin B-6 restriction tends to reduce the red blood cell glutathione synthesis rate without affecting red blood cell or plasma glutathioneconcentrations in healthy men and women 1–3 Yvonne Lamers, Bruce O’Rourke, Lesa R Gilbert, Christine Keeling, Dwight E Matthews, Peter W Stacpoole, and Jesse F Gregory III ABSTRACT Background: Glutathione plays various protective roles in the hu- man body.Vitamin B-6 as pyridoxal-5 #-phosphate (PLP) is required as the coenzyme in the formation of glutathione precursors.
Despitethis obligatory role of PLP, previous studies from this laboratory showed that vitamin B-6 deﬁciency caused elevated glutathione concentrations in rat liver and human plasma.Objective: Our aim was to determine the effect of marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency (plasma PLP 20–30 nmol/L) on the rate of red blood cell (RBC) glutathione synthesis.Design: We measured plasma and RBC glutathione concentrations and the fractional and absolute synthesis rates of RBC glutathione using the stable-isotope-labeled glutathione precursor [1,2- 13C2]gly- cine in 13 healthy volunteers aged 21–39 y.Results: Dietary vitamin B-6 restriction did not signiﬁcantly affect the glutathione concentration in plasma (6.9 61.9 compared with 6.761.1lmol/L) or RBCs (2068 650 compared with 2117 648 lmol/L).
For RBC glutathione, the mean fractional synthesis rates were 54 65%/d and 43 64%/d ( P= 0.10), and the absolute synthesis rates were 1116 6100 and 916 692lmol /C1L 21/C1d21 (P= 0.14) before and after vitamin B-6 restriction, respectively. Conclusions: Marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency tended to decrease mean RBC glutathione synthesis with no effect on RBC glutathioneconcentration, but the responses varied widely among individuals.Because the cysteine concentration in plasma and RBC did not change during vitamin B-6 restriction, we conclude that the effects of marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency on glutathione synthesis are notcaused by altered precursor concentrations.Am J Clin Nutr 2009;90:336–43.INTRODUCTION Glutathione is a vital factor in metabolic protective functions, including the reduction of hydroperoxides, the quenching of free radicals, and the detoxiﬁcation of xenobiotics (1, 2).
Glutathione synthesis from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine is tightly regulated,with its determinants including the activity of c-glutamylcysteine synthetase and the intracellular availability of cysteine (2, 3). Cysteine can be synthesized from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway.Both enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway—cystathionine b-synthase and cystathionine c-lyase— require vitamin B-6 in the form of pyridoxal-5 #-phosphate (PLP) as coenzyme.PLP also serves as a coenzyme in the for-mation of glycine from serine through serine hydroxymethyl- transferase.Marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency, deﬁned as a plasma PLP concentration between 20 and 30 nmol/L (4), occurs frequently (5) and is associated with coronary artery disease (6–8), stroke (9), and an elevated risk of Alzheimer disease (10).Themechanisms responsible for linkages between vitamin B-6 status and chronic disease have not yet been established.
A previous study from this laboratory showed that hepatic glutathione was inversely related to the dietary pyridoxine concentration over a range from fully adequate (2 mg/kg diet) through moderate (0.5 mg/kg diet) and pronounced deﬁciency(0.1 mg/kg) in rats (11). Plasma glutathione increased signiﬁ-cantly during dietary vitamin B-6 restriction in healthy young men and women (12).The mechanism by which reduced vitamin B-6 status affects mammalian glutathione metabolism remainsunclear.One may speculate that increases in tissue or blood glutathione might be induced by an inﬂammatory state (13) and oxidative stress (14–16) related to vitamin B-6 deﬁciency.Ox-idative conditions potentially promote transsulfuration ﬂux by activating cystathionine b-synthase (17, 18) and glutathione synthesis via activation of c-glutamylcysteine ligase and gluta- thione synthetase (18).
On the basis of the observations of our previous protocols and the reported connection between vitamin B-6 deﬁciency and oxidative stress, we hypothesize that gluta-thione synthesis increases after vitamin B-6 restriction in hu-mans despite the essential role of PLP in the production of glutathione precursors. 1From the Food Science and Human Nutrition Department, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL (YL and JFG); the Department of Chemistry, University of Vermont, Burlington,VT (BO and DEM); the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, De- partment of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL (LRG, CK, and PWS); and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Collegeof Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL (PWS).2Supported by NIH grant DK072398 and General Clinical Research Cen- ter grant M01-RR00082.

Our aim was to quantify thefractional synthesis rate (FSR) and the absolute synthesis rate (ASR) of RBC glutathione and to determine their dependence on vitamin B-6 status in vivo. We also report plasma and RBCconcentrations of glutathione and related amino acids before andafter dietary vitamin B-6 restriction in this group of 13 healthy men and women.SUBJECTS AND METHODS Subjects Volunteers underwent a physical examination and were screened by standard clinical measures of hematological, hepatic, renal, and thyroid function.Medical history, dietary habits, anddemographic data were assessed by a questionnaire.
Of 37 recruited healthy male and nonpregnant female volunteers, 23 met the following inclusion criteria: age between 20–40 y, nohistory of gastrointestinal surgery, abnormal kidney or thyroidfunction, or any other chronic disease; no smoking or chronic drug use or alcoholism; no vitamin, amino acid, or protein supplementation; no chronic consumption of a high-protein diet;and a body mass index (in kg/m 2),28. All selected subjects were in adequate nutritional status for serum folate ( .7 nmol/ L), serum vitamin B-12 ( .200 pmol/L), plasma PLP ( .30 nmol/L), and plasma total homocysteine ( ,12lmol/L).Before the study, 6 of the 23 subjects that passed screening withdrew because of personal reasons or scheduling problems.Three subjects were withdrawn during intervention because ofchanges in health status and one withdrew for personal reasons.All subjects gave written informed consent.
The University of Florida Institutional Review Board and the General ClinicalResearch Center (GCRC) Scientiﬁc Advisory Committee reviewed and approved this protocol. Dietary treatment All meals were prepared by the Bionutrition Unit of the GCRC.The subjects consumed nutritionally adequate meals witha standardized composition for 2 d to minimize dietary variation immediately before the ﬁrst infusion.Subjects began consuming a vitamin B-6–restricted diet (0.32–0.38 mg vitamin B-6/d) onthe day after the ﬁrst infusion and continued this regimen for 28 consecutive days (29–31).During this period, the subjects consumed breakfast at the GCRC, were given a take-out lunchand snack to eat at their convenience, and returned to the GCRCto consume their evening meal.
We compensated for any vitamin and mineral inadequacies of the study diets (other than vitamin B-6) by administering custom supplements daily to the subjects.Compliance with the dietary regimen was monitored by weekly measurements of plasma PLP as described below. After the second infusion day, an over-the-co unter multivitamin-multimineralsupplement was provided to the subjects to facilitate restoration of normal vitamin B-6 status.Isotope infusion protocol The infusion protocol was previously described in detail (29, 32).[1,2- 13C2]Glycine, L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine and sodium [13C]bicarbonate were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories (Andover, MA).The parenteral solutions of thesecompounds were prepared in isotonic saline, ﬁlter sterilized, andanalyzed to ensure the lack of pyrogenicity and microbial con- tamination.Subjects were admitted to the GCRC on the evening before the infusion protocol and consumed no food or drinks, except water, between 2100 and the ﬁrst blood draw.
On the morning of the infusion, a catheter was inserted in the antecubital vein of eacharm: one for the tracer infusion and one for blood collection. Fasting blood samples were collected 2 h before infusion (at ’0700) for the measurement of plasma PLP, serum folate, vitamin B-12, and plasma total homocysteine concentrations.Infusions were initiated at ’0900 with a 5-min, ’20 mL priming dose that delivered 9.26 lmol [1,2- 13C2]glycine/kg, 1.87 lmol [5,5,5-2H3]leucine/kg, and 2.15 lmol NaH13CO3/kg.The 9-h constant infusion followed immediately thereafter at a rate of ’20 mL/h to provide 9.26 lmol [1,2-13C2]glycine/kg and 1.87 lmol [5,5,5-2H3]leucine/kg.Blood samples were taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.5, and 9 h of the infusion.The samples were placed immediately on ice and centrifuged within 15 min after the blood draw (1500 ·g, 4/C176C, 10 min).Plasma was stored in microcentrifuge tubes at 280/C176C.
After removal of the buffy coat, RBCs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), lysed in distilledwater in a 1:1 dilution, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at280/C176C until analyzed. The subjects received a nutritive formula hourly starting 2 h before the infusion to maintain a fed state (33).This formulaprovided a balanced pattern of amino acids at a rate based on requirements of 0.8 g protein /C1kg 21/C1d21, which equals an hourly protein dose of ’0.03 g/kg with 5.23 and 5.44 kJ /C1kg21/C1 d21for women and men, respectively.The formula further provided an adequate energy intake according to the require- ments of 126 and 130 kJ /C1kg21/C1d21for women and men, respectively.Sample analyses Screening measurements Serum folate and vitamin B-12 were analyzed with the use of a chemiluminescence-based assay (Elecsys; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).
Plasma total homocysteine concentrations were measured as the ammonium 7-ﬂuorobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonate derivative by reversed-phase HPLC with ﬂuorescence detection (34). Plasma and RBC concentrations of amino acids and PLP Plasma and RBC glutathione, cysteine, and cysteinyl-glycine concentrations were measured as described for plasma totalhomocysteine screening by reversed-phase HPLC with ﬂuores- cence detection (34).Plasma and RBC PLP concentrations were measured as the semicarbazone derivative by reversed-phaseVITAMIN B-6 DEPENDENCE ON GLUTATHIONE SYNTHESIS 337 HPLC with ﬂuorescence detection (35, 36).Hemoglobin from lysed RBCs was measured with the use of a commercial sprectrophotometric procedure (HemoCue Hb 201+; HemoCue AB, A ¨ngelholm, Sweden).
Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry determination of amino acid isotopic enrichment and concentration RBC amino acids were isolated, derivatized, and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in elec-tron capture negative ionization mode as previously described(37). The relative abundance of speciﬁc ions was determined by selected-ion monitoring at the following m/zratios: glycine (293–295) and leucine (349–352).Isotopic enrichments areexpressed as molar ratios (mol% excess) of labeled to un- labeled isotopomers after correction for the natural abundance of stable isotopes, essentially as performed by Storch et al(33).Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of RBC glutathione isotopic enrichment Whole-blood glutathione was isolated and derivatized from a modiﬁed method developed by Guan et al (38).Aliquots of whole blood (150 lL) were transferred to 1.5-mL conical mi- crocentrifuge tubes, and the tubes were frozen at 280/C176C, thawed, and vortex mixed.
This procedure was repeated 3 times to lyse the RBCs in the whole-blood aliquot. A 300- lL aliquot of 10 mmol/L Ellman’s solution [39.6 mg 5,5 #-dithiobis-(2- nitrobenzoic acid); Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in 10 mL of 100 mmol ammonium bicarbonate buffer solution/L, adjusted topH = 7.5] was added to each microcentrifuge vial; the vials werevortex mixed, allowed to sit at room temperature for 15 min, and vortex mixed again.A 150- lL aliquot of 200 g sulfosalicylic acid solution/L was added, and each microcentrifuge vial wasvortex mixed again.The vials were centrifuged (10,000 ·g) for 15 min, and the supernatant ﬂuid was transferred to a second microcentrifuge vial and centrifuged again at (10,000 ·g) for 15 min.The supernatant ﬂuid of each vial was then carefully transferred to 250- lL polypropylene autosampler vials and stored at 280/C176C until analyzed.
The derivatized glutathione samples were measured for 13C tracer content by LC-MS by using a Thermo-Finnigan Surveyor LC coupled with a Thermo-Finnigan (San Jose, CA) LCQ DecaXP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer, conﬁgured in positiveelectrospray ionization (ESI) mode. The ESI spray voltage was set at 4.5 kV; sheath gas (N 2) was kept at a setting of 40, and the capillary temperature was maintained at 225 /C176C.The LC column used was an Atlantis dC 18,1·150-mm, 3- lm bead column (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) kept at 40 /C176C.The LC was run isocratically at 87% water, 12.5% acetonitrile, and 0.5% glacialacetic acid.The total run time was 11 min, with a mobile phase ﬂow of 55 lL/min and a typical retention time for derivatized glutathione of ’7 min.The LC efﬂuent was diverted away from the ESI source for the initial 3 min of each LC run to keep anyunreacted Ellman’s solution and residual sulfosalicylic acid from entering the ESI-LC-MS source.
All mass spectrometry data were collected in “zoom scan” mode at ’1 scan/s covering the isotopic envelope for the [M+H] +ion of the derivatized glutathione ( m/z= 504.5–508.5) to maximize mass resolution between isotopomers. After data acquisition, the intensity ofeach mass was averaged for the glutathione peak by using the Thermo-Finnigan Xcalibur Qual browser software.The peak areas for the [M+H]+ion for unlabeled glutathione ( m/z= 505) and [13C2]glutathione ( m/z= 507) were then exported to an Excel worksheet, and the area ratios were converted to enrich- ment as mole% excess13C2-glutathione with the use of standard equations.Kinetic principles and analysis As reported previously (29, 32), the combined use of [1,2-13C2]glycine and [2H3]leucine permits determination of the kinetics of whole-body glycine turnover, the conversionof glycine to serine, the rate of glycine decarboxylation, and its role as a source of 1-carbon units in 1-carbon metabolism.
[ 2H3]Leucine was included to evaluate any nutritional effects on protein turnover as indicated by leucine ﬂux (31, 39). The pla- teau enrichment (Ep) for all infused amino acid tracers was calculated as the mean of the plasma isotopic enrichments forthe’1.5-h to 9-h time points for the infused [ 13C2]glycine and [2H3]leucine tracers.Steady state kinetics of amino acid tracers were calculated by using standard equations (40) as described earlier (29, 32).The ﬂux of leucine ( QLeu) in the plasma pool was calculated as QLeu¼ILeu3½ðELeuÞ=ðEpLeuÞ21/C138ð 1Þ where ILeuis the [2H3]leucine infusion rate, ELeuis the enrich- ment of the [2H3]leucine tracer, and Ep Leuis the plateau enrich- ment of [2H3]leucine in plasma.
Glycine ﬂux ( QGly) was calculated as QGly¼IGly3/C2/C0 EGly/C1 =/C0 Ep#Gly/C1 21/C3 ð2Þ where IGlyis the [13C2]glycine infusion rate, EGlyis the enrich- ment of the [13C2]glycine tracer, and Ep #Glyis the plateau en- richment of plasma [13C2]glycine corrected for intracellular overestimation (41, 42). The FSR represents the fraction of the total pool that is synthesized per unit of time.The direct incorporation of theinfused [1,2- 13C2]glycine tracer (glycine M+2) in glutathione synthesis was determined and, thus, the synthesis of glutathione M+2.The FSR of RBC glutathione was approximated by using the initial rate of glutathione M+2 enrichment (slope of lin- ear increase among the time points 4, 6, 7.5, and 9 h after in- fusion) and the estimated plateau enrichment of RBC glycine (Ep RBC glycine ).
FSR glutathione ¼initial rate of RBC glutathione M þ2 enrichment =EpRBC glycine ð3Þ The RBC glycine enrichment at plateau (Ep RBC glycine ) was de- termined by ﬁtting enrichment data to single exponential curves deﬁned by the equation E¼Efð12e2ktÞð 4Þ where Eis the enrichment at time t(h),Efis the enrichment at inﬁnity (ie, plateau enrichment), and kis the rate constant (h21) from the ﬁtted curve (43). Data were ﬁt to this single exponential338 LAMERS ET AL regression equation by using the “exponential rise to maximum” function of SigmaPlot 2002 (SPSS version 8.02; SPSS, Roches- ter, MN).The ASR was derived from the FSR glutathione and the RBC total glutathione pool: ASR glutathione ¼FSR glutathione 3total RBC glutathione concentration ð5Þ Statistical analysis In all tracer measurements, isotopic enrichment was expressed as the ratio of labeled to nonlabeled isotopomers after correctionfor the natural abundance of stable isotopes.All data are pre-sented as means 6SEMs.
A paired ttest was used to assess differences between normal vitamin B-6 status and marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency. Correlations between static and dynamicparameters of glutathione synthesis were determined with the use of the Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient.Linear re- gression was used to determine the inﬂuence of static and dy-namic variables on the rate of glutathione synthesis before and after vitamin B-6 restriction and on the change in the ASR and FSR of RBC glutathione.Tertiles of RBC glutathione FSR wereevaluated by using one-factor ANOVA, with multiple compar-isons performed by using the Holm-Sidak method.Data were analyzed by using Microsoft Ofﬁce Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA), SigmaStat 3.0, and SPSS 16.0(SPSS Inc, Rochester, MN).RESULTS Dietary vitamin B-6 restriction signiﬁcantly reduced the plasma PLP concentration ( Table 1 )b y5 563%.
All 13 subjects had reached the range of plasma PLP associated with marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency after 22 62 d of consuming the vitamin B-6–restricted diet. Concurrent with the decrease in plasma PLPconcentration, vitamin B-6 restriction signiﬁcantly reduced the RBC PLP concentration (Table 1) by 18 62%.Marginal vita- min B-6 deﬁciency did not alter the plasma and RBC concen-trations of glutathione, cysteine, and cysteinyl-glycine.As reported previously (29), these subjects showed no change in plasma serine, methionine, or total homocysteine concen-trations, whereas their plasma glycine and cystathionine con- centrations signiﬁcantly increased because of vitamin B-6 restriction.The progressive isotopic enrichment of RBC glutathione and its precursor RBC glycine in this protocol are presented in Figure 1.
The means for FSR and ASR of RBC glutathione ( Table 2 ) were slightly lower in marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency; how-ever, this did not reach statistical signiﬁcance ( P= 0.10 and P= 0.14, respectively). The individual FSR of RBC glutathione responded to vitamin B-6 restriction, ranging from a 58% de-crease to a 45% increase ( Figure 2 A).The individual ASRs of RBC glutathione ranged from a 57% decrease to a 58% increase (Figure 2B).To further examine the heterogeneity of this re-sponse, we ranked FSR values according to the extent and di- rection of absolute change due to vitamin B-6 restriction and divided them into tertiles ( Table 3 ).ASR and FSR of RBC glutathione at normal vitamin B-6 status signiﬁcantly correlatedwith the extent of change in ASR and FSR observed due to vitamin B-6 restriction, respectively (ASR: q=20.698, P, 0.01; FSR: q=20.692, P,0.01).
The change in RBC PLP concentration in response to vitamin B-6 restriction was sig- niﬁcantly related to the change in RBC cysteine concentration TABLE 1 Concentration of plasma and red blood cell (RBC) pyridoxal-5 #-phosphate (PLP), glutathione, total cysteine, and cysteinylglycine before and afterdietary vitamin B-6 restriction 1 At normal vitamin B-6 statusAt marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency Plasma PLP (nmol/L) 55 642 3 612 RBC PLP (pmol/g hemoglobin) 429 619 352 6142 Plasma glutathione ( lmol/L) 6.9 61.9 6.7 61.1 RBC glutathione (lmol/L packed red cells)2068650 2117 648 Plasma total cysteine ( lmol/L)237633 237 629 RBC total cysteine (nmol/g hemoglobin)14168 144 68 Plasma cysteinylglycine (lmol/L)31.261.4 29.7 61.3 RBC cysteinylglycine (nmol/g hemoglobin)193615 200 618 1All values are means 6SEMs; n= 13. 2Signiﬁcantly different from normal vitamin B-6 status, P,0.0001 (paired ttest).FIGURE 1.

Linear regression showed that the change in ASR and FSR of RBC glutathione in response tovitamin B-6 restriction were both negatively dependent on the FSR at normal vitamin B-6 status ( Figure 3 ).DISCUSSION Vitamin B-6 depletion and marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency have been shown to increase glutathione concentrations in ratliver (11, 44) and human plasma (12).To our knowledge, this was the ﬁrst study to investigate the effect of vitamin B-6 status on in vivo glutathione synthesis in healthy men and women.Weshowed that marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency tended to decrease RBC glutathione synthesis rates without affecting the plasma and RBC total glutathione concentration.
The response of RBCglutathione synthesis rate to vitamin B-6 restriction varied greatly among subjects and was shown to depend on the initial FSR value (Figure 3). Changes in RBC glutathione synthesis rates were notpredicted by the concentration or extent of change in plasma and RBC cysteine and glutathione.Thus, the effect of marginalTABLE 2 Fractional synthesis rate (FSR) and absolute synthesis rate (ASR) of red blood cell (RBC) glutathione and whole-body glycine and leucine ﬂuxbefore and after vitamin B-6 restriction 1 Normal vitamin B-6 statusMarginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency FSR of RBC glutathione (%/d)53.764.5 43.2 64.1 ASR of RBC glutathione ( lmol /C1L packed red cells21/C1d21)11166100 916 692 Whole-body glycine ﬂux (lmol /C1kg21/C1h21)448620 446 616 Whole-body leucine ﬂux (lmol /C1kg21/C1h21)10664 106 67 1All values are means 6SEMs; n= 13.FIGURE 2.

This ﬁnding is consistent with recent results of math-ematical modeling simulations that predicted the effect of mild vitamin B-6 deﬁciency on blood glutathione concentration to be solely related to increased oxidative stress and not to the reducedvelocity of PLP-dependent enzymes involved in cysteine for- mation (45).The variability in responses among subjects might result from factors inﬂuencing the activity and expression ofc-glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase, eg antioxidants and hormones such as insulin and glucocorticoids (1).
Because deﬁciencies of c-glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase and glutathione synthetase occur very rarely and are related to severe clinical symptoms (46), wedo not believe that the observed variation in the basal rate of glutathione synthesis was associated with genetic variation. Furthermore, we were unable to postulate a mechanism by whichcellular PLP depletion would directly alter glutathione synthesis.Despite the fact that marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency yielded substantial and individually varied glutathione synthesisresponses, plasma and RBC glutathione concentrations remained constant in our subjects.Similar ﬁndings were reported by Lyons et al (26), who observed reduced whole-blood glutathione syn-thesis rates but unaltered whole-blood glutathione concentrationsafter a 10-d sulfur amino acid–free diet in healthy men.
In ad- dition, mathematical modeling predicted constant blood gluta- thione concentrations during increasing oxidative stress anddecreasing cytoplasmic (largely hepatic) glutathione concen- trations (45). A possible explanation for this observation is a reduced glutathione turnover (26), potentially caused by re-duced glutathione transport (47).In rat heart and liver tissues, a more severe vitamin B-6 deﬁciency induced an increase in glutathione peroxidase activity and to a lesser extent in gluta-thione reductase activity (15).
This shift in enzyme activity evoked a decrease in the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione, whereas glutathione concentrations remained unaltered (15).Although our results indicate that the effects of marginal vitaminB-6 deﬁciency on glutathione synthesis are independent of the cysteine supply, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the variation in response in glutathione synthesis with concurrentlyconstant RBC glutathione concentration remain to be de- termined. Cysteine formation through the transsulfuration pathway is an important source of cysteine for glutathione synthesis.The de- pendence of glutathione synthesis on cystathionine b-synthase was shown in an in vitro model in which the glutathione con-centration decreased by half within 17.5 min after inactivation of cystathionine b-synthase (48).As shown in this study and pre- viously (12), marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency did not alterplasma or RBC cysteine concentrations.
Furthermore, the he-patic cysteine concentration was maintained in rats with mod- erate levels of deﬁciency (11). In vivo cysteine ﬂux is maintained in human vitamin B-6 deﬁciency states (12).Like-wise, this research group has shown that the in vitro activity of hepatic cystathionine c-lyase is depressed even in rats with mild vitamin B-6 deﬁciency (11), but the hepatic cysteine concen-tration in rats is approximately constant over a wide range of moderate vitamin B-6 deﬁciency states (11).We previously proposed that elevated cystathionine, under conditions in whichcystathionine is lower than the Michaelis constant for cys-tathionine c-lyase, compensates at least partially for the re-duction in cystathionine c-lyase caused by PLP depletion (11, 12) to allow transsulfuration ﬂux to be maintained in marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency.
We suggest that cysteine formationthrough transsulfuration is resilient to marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency and, thus, cysteine production does not limit gluta- thione synthesis at this level of deﬁciency. This situation differsfrom more severe vitamin B-6 deﬁciency that is capable of re- ducing cysteine availability to the extent glutathione synthesis is impaired and glutathione concentration is reduced (49).Methionine and cysteine contribute equally to glutathione synthesis as shown in rat hepatocytes (50).At an adequate intake of methionine, the dietary cysteine supply did not alter the RBCglutathione synthesis rate in healthy adults (51).A diet free ofmethionine and cysteine signiﬁcantly reduced the whole-blood glutathione synthesis rate, whereas it did not affect the whole- blood glutathione concentration (26).
In our study, the subjectsconsumed an adequate supply of protein (73 64 g/d) and of methionine and cystine (1.7 60.1 and 1.3 60.1 mg/d) during the 28-d vitamin B-6–restricted diet. Cysteine in plasma ﬂuc-tuates depending on protein and glutathione breakdown in tis- sues (3).Glutathione breakdown has been shown to account for 50% of cysteine ﬂux (24).A 30% decrease in the plasma cys-teine concentration after a 10-d sulfur amino acid–free diet (26)could be explained primarily by reduced protein breakdown.In our study, marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency did not change whole-body protein turnover as indicated by constant whole-body leucine ﬂux.The observed variation in effects of vitamin B-6 restriction on the glutathione synthesis rate was, therefore, unrelated to changes in protein turnover or sulfur amino acidintake.RBC glutathione has widely been used in the quantiﬁcation of in vivo glutathione synthesis rate (19–22).
In rabbits (52) and pigs(53), faster glutathione synthesis was determined in liver than in blood cells. Compared with control rats without infection, septic rats had lower glutathione synthesis rates in whole blood buthigher rates in liver, spleen, large intestine, lung, muscle, andheart (54).This observation would explain our ﬁndings of slightly reduced mean RBC glutathione synthesis in the present study and an elevated liver glutathione concentration in vitamin B-6–deﬁcient rats in our previous report (11).Also, Hsu et al (44) found increased glutathione synthesis rates in vitamin B-6– depleted rat liver and only mildly increased RBC glutathioneconcentrations.In addition, it should be recognized that the effects of vitamin B-6 restriction on RBC glutathione synthesis would result from reduced PLP in the liver and other tissuescapable of 1-carbon metabolism and transsulfuration.
The rat liver PLP concentration decreased proportionally to the dietary pyridoxine concentration, which indicated that the dietary vita-min B-6 supply affects the vitamin B-6 concentration and,therefore, the coenzyme function at the tissue level (11). Whereas the reductions in plasma and RBC PLP reﬂect the dietary vitamin B-6 intake, it should not be assumed that the ﬂuxes of such PLP-dependent processes would be equally affected at various extents of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency.In conclusion, we showed with this human tracer study, a rat model (11), and a mathematical model (45) that vitamin B-6 status has an effect on glutathione metabolism that varies from person to person.Our results also indicate that variations in theRBC glutathione synthesis rates and in glutathione concentrationsdo not occur as a result of an impaired supply of the precursorVITAMIN B-6 DEPENDENCE ON GLUTATHIONE SYNTHESIS 341 amino acid cysteine.
Additional research is needed to clarify the mechanism behind the effect of low vitamin B-6 status on glutathione metabolism.
