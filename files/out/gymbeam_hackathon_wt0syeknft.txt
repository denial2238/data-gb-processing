Vitamin Aisimportant inthat itcannot bemade inthehuman body and must betaken from outside thebody through thediet [2].Ensuring that vitamin Aisavailable inanyform insuffi- cient quantities remains achallenge, especially inregions where access tovitamin A-contain- ingfoods and healthcare interventions islimited [3].Asaresult, vitamin Adeficiency (VAD) becomes acommon form ofmicronutrient deficiency [4]. Good vitamin Aconsumption refers totheintake offoods rich invitamin Aatleast one food item among themain type offood items while VAD istheresult oftwoprimary factors, high frequency ofinfections, and poverty-related problems [5].Moreover, socio-cultural limi- tations and poor absorption leading toimpoverished vitamin Astores inthebody have been regarded aspotential determinants oftheprevalence ofVAD [6].
Adeficiency ofvitamin Ainthemother leads tolowlevels ofvitamin Ainbreast milk, inadequate dietary intake ofvitamin Aduring and after weaning, and prevalent illness causes ofvitamin Adeficiency inyoung children [7].The quality and variety offoods reflect theade- quacy ofvitamin A.The quality ofthediet and vitamin Alevels aredeclining inmothers and young children. This islikely theresult ofchanging diets toinclude foods ofanimal origin with lower levels ofvitamin Aand, toalesser extent, vegetables and fruits [8].Children and their mothers aremost susceptible toitsconsequences, which include arange ofVADD [7,9].Worldwide, itisestimated that more than 124million children require vitamin A[10].Children require extra vitamin Abecause they arenotconsuming enough intheir nor- mal diet.
Whereas, food items with inadequate vitamin Alead todepletion ofserum vitamin A levels which affects tissue development, metabolism, and resistance toinfections [6].Also, lack ofvitamin Aisarisk factor forblindness and mortality from measles and diarrhea inchildren aged 6to59months [5,10–13]. One study found that asignificantly greater proportion ofsub- jects who hadVAD were hospitalized, compared tothose who were notdeficient.The only person who died waswith impaired vitamin A[14].Adeficiency canbeeffectively prevented inacomplementary manner through approaches that include supplementation, fortification, biofortification, and improving dietary diversity, with thechoice ofapproaches guided byurgency, epidemiological patterns, and local resources [6,9,13,15].
The prevalence ofVAD hasdeclined worldwide, possibly duetowidespread vitamin Asupple- mentation incombination with measles vaccination inat-risk populations [3].While Vitamin A deficiency affects thepoorest segments ofthepopulation, particularly those inlow- andmiddle- income countries [9,13,16–18]. Therefore, inlow- andmiddle-income countries, routine vitamin PLOS ONEDeterminan tsofgood vitamin Aconsumption inthe12East Africa countries PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02816 81February 16,2023 2/15 Asupplementation (VAS) isakeystrategy toreduce vitamin Adeficiency, mortality, andmor- bidity inpreschool children [19].VAS isaneffective strategy forpreventing vitamin Adeficiency disorders (VADD) butdoes notsustainably improve thevitamin Astatus ofapopulation, does notaddress underlying causes, anddoes notreach women ofreproductive age[9].
Estimates indicate that thenew supplementation regimen willpermit atypical child ina developing country setting toattain minimally adequate vitamin Astores during thefirst 2 years oflife[7].Furthermore, Improved vitamin Anurture alone could prevent 1.3–2.5 million ofthenearly 8million lateinfancy and preschool-age child deaths that occur each year inthe highest-risk developing countries [20]. Effective and long-term control ofvitamin Adeficiency may beamong themost cost-effective and effective interventions forchild survival [12].Controlling vitamin Adeficiency isapublic health imperative [21].Todeal with vitamin A insufficiency, policymakers view dietary modification that leads totheconsumption ofvitamin A-rich foods asthesafest and most appropriate long-term measure tocontrol vitamin Adefi- ciency [22].
However, some cultural beliefs limit good consumption ofvitamin A-rich foods, and ade- quate consumption ofvitamin A-rich foods isalso compromised bythecost ofthese foods, as well asbylocal cooking, storage, preservation techniques, and seasonality ofthese foods [23]. The availability offoods with high levels ofvitamin Aisoften seasonal.Forexample, insome regions, therainy season ismarked byabundant wild leafy vegetables.When liver retinol reserves areloworvitamin Astatus iscompromised byillness, seasonal fluctuations may cause periods ofhigher risk ofdeficiency ofvitamin A[24].VAD isamajor global public health problem that makes asignificant contribution tothe global burden ofdisease [3].Moreover, itremains amajor public health issue inunderserved and undernourished areas oftheworld [9].Vitamin Adeficiency isvery common intheAfrican continent.Vitamin Adeficiency affects more than 30million children, most ofwhom areyounger than fiveyears ofage[25].
Among themany challenges Africa willhave toface inthenext fewyears, vitamin Adeficiency canbe overcome considering that theneed isurgent andthat solutions areknown, effective, and affordable [12]. In2013, theprevalence ofdeficiency washighest insub-Saharan Africa [10].Inmany Eastern and Southern African countries, between one-third and halfofthechil- dren suffer from VAD [15].VAD isamajor nutritional public health problem inchildren under theageoffiveindeveloping countries, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa [26,27].Whereas, VAD isaserious health problem inEast Africa.The main reason for thehigh rate ofvitamin Adeficiency isaninadequate diet.Much ofthepopulation does not consume enough food tomeet itscalorie requirements, and thevariety and nutritional quality ofthefood areoften poor.Inaddition, thehigh frequency ofinfectious diseases raises therisk ofvitamin Adeficiency [15].While 62% ofchildren aged 6–23 months hadpoor vitamin A food intake inEthiopia [17,28,29].
Even though good Vitamin Aconsumption hasasignificant contribution tothereduction ofmorbidity and mortality ofinfants and children, asfarasourknowledge isconcerned, there isnostudy regarding themagnitude and determinants ofgood Vitamin Aconsumption in East African countries. Thus, thisstudy isconducted todetermine themagnitude and determi- nants ofgood Vitamin Aconsumption intwelve East African countries.Methods Data source, tool, and sampling procedure The data wasobtained from themeasure DHS program atwww.measuredhs.com after prepar- ingaconcept note about theproject.The DHS program collects data across over 90low- and PLOS ONEDeterminan tsofgood vitamin Aconsumption inthe12East Africa countries PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02816 81February 16,2023 3/15 middle-income countries across theworld.The collected data iscomparable foreach country.The program implemented thesame variable code, variable name, manual, data collection tool, and sampling procedure.
Therefore, thisstudy wasperformed according torelevant DHS statistics guidelines [30]. The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data were pooled from the12East Africa Countries from 2008 to2017.The recent DHS ofCountry-specific datasets wasextracted during thespecified time.The 12East Africa Countries from which data were extracted include Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Comoros, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.The DHS program adopts standardized methods involving uniform questionnaires, manuals, and field procedures togather informa- tion that iscomparable across countries intheworld.DHSs arenationally representative household surveys that provide data from awide range ofmonitoring and impact evaluation indicators inthearea ofpopulation, health, and nutrition with face-to-face interviews of women aged 15to49.The surveys employ astratified, multi-stage, random sampling design.
Information wasobtained from eligible women aged 15to49years ineach country. “The DHS program surveyed according tofollowing sampling procedures.The surveys employ a stratified, multi-stage, random sampling design.First stage: Enumeration Areas (EA) aregen- erally drawn from each country’s Census files.Second stage: ineach EAselected, asample of households isdrawn from anupdated listofhouseholds.Information wasobtained from eligi- blewomen aged 15to49years ineach country.Detailed survey methodology and sampling methods used ingathering thedata have been reported elsewhere [31].Sample size Atotal of32,275 study participants were included inthisstudy.This include Burundi (4,323), Ethiopia(3,240),Kenya(5,576), Comoros(870),Madagascar(1,725), Malawi(1,641),Mozambique (3,500),Tanzania(1,195),Rwa nda(3,082),Uganda(1,429),Za mbia(3,811),and Zimbabwe(1,877).Missing data were excluded from theanalysis.Variables Outcome variable.
Living children aged 6–23 months living with their mother who con- sumed foods rich invitamin Aatleast onefood item among theseven food items (1)Have the child taken eggs inthelast24hours?2) Have thechild taken meat (beef, pork, lamb, chicken, etc.) inthelast24hours? 3)Have thechild taken apumpkin, carrots, and squash (yellow or orange inside) inthelast24hours?4)Have thechild taken anydark green leafy vegetables in thelast24hours?5)Have thechild taken mangoes, papayas, and another vitamin Afruit in thelast24hours?6)Have thechild wastaken liver, heart, and other organs inthelast24 hours?7)Have thechild taken fishorshellfish inthelast24hours?) atanytime inthelast24 hours preceding theinterview wasdeclared good consumption offoods rich invitamin A coded as“1”,whereas, noconsumption offoods rich invitamin Ainthe24hours preceding theinterview waspoor consumption coded as“0”.Independent variables.
Based onknown facts and literature theindependent variables included inthiswastwotypes ofvariable that areindividual-level and community-level vari- ables. Community-level variables Country and residence.The individual-level variables are Age group, marital status, Educational status, literacy level, Occupational status, parity, chil- dren’s ageinamonth, family sizeand wealth index, breastfeeding status, and media exposure.Data management and analysis The data wascleaned bySTATA version 14.1 software.Sample weighting wasdone forfurther analysis.PLOS ONEDeterminan tsofgood vitamin Aconsumption inthe12East Africa countries PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02816 81February 16,2023 4/15 Multi-level analysis Since theoutcome variable wasbinary two-level mixed-effects logistic regression analysis was employed.Sampling weight wasapplied aspart ofacomplex survey design using theprimary sampling unit, strata, and women’s weight (V005).
The individual and community-level variables associated with good vitamin Aconsump- tion were checked independently inthebivariable multilevel logistic regression model and Variables that were statistically significant atap-value of0.2inthebivariable multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analysis were considered fortheindividual and community level model adjustments. Model building Atotal offour models were fitted.The first wasthenull model with noexposure variables that were used toverify thevariation inthecommunity and give evidence toevaluate random effects atthelevel ofcommunity.The second model wastheadjustment ofthemultiple vari- able models forindividual variables and thethird model wasadjusted toconsider factors atthe community level.Whereas, inthefourth model, potential candidate variables from individual and community variables were adjusted totheoutcome variable.
Parameter estimation method Fixed effects were used toestimate theassociation between theprobability ofgood vitamin A consumption explanatory variables atcommunity and individual levels and have been expressed asanodds ratio with a95% confidence interval. Formeasures ofvariation (random effects), theintracluster correlation coefficient (CCI), theproportional variation ofcommunity variance (VCP), and themedian odds ratio (MOR) were used.The MOR isdefined asthe median oftheodds ratio between thezone ofgreatest risk and thezone with thelowest risk when twozones arerandomly selected.The purpose oftheMedian Odds Ratio (MOR) isto translate thearea level variance inthewidely used odds ratio (OR) scale that hasaconsistent and intuitive interpretation.

Whereas theproportional change invariance iscalculated as[33] PCV¼½ðVA VBÞ=VA��1 00; Where; where VA=variance oftheinitial model, and VB=variance ofthemodel with more terms.Result Atotal of32,275 children aged 6to23months inthelast10years oftheEast Africa Countries were included inthisstudy.Ofthese 20,304(62.91%) with a95% confidence interval, 62.37% to63.43% consumed good vitamin Ainthe12East Africa Countries.The largest number of children age6to23months 5,576 (17.28%) were from Kenya and thesmallest number ofchil- dren aged 6to23months 870(2.70%) were from Comoros.The majority ofthe24,765 (76.73%) respondents were rural residents.
The median agegroup ofstudy respondents was28 years with aninterquartile range of24to34years with almost halfofthem 14,976 (46.40%) under thecategory oftheagegroup of25to34.The majority ofstudy participants 23,436 (72.61%) were married. Almost halfofthestudy participants 16,162 (50.08%) hadaprimary PLOS ONEDeterminan tsofgood vitamin Aconsumption inthe12East Africa countries PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02816 81February 16,2023 5/15 level ofeducation.The higher proportion ofgood vitamin Aconsumption 80.84% was recorded inBurundi and thesmallest good vitamin Aconsumption recorded at34.12% was recorded inKenya (Table 1,Figs 1and 2).Multilevel logistic regression analysis The random-effects analysis result.Fixed effects and random interceptions forgood vitamin Aintake areshown inTable 1.The results ofthenull model (Model I)showed statisti- cally significant variability intheodds ofvitamin Aintake with community variance (t=0.417, p-value =p<0.001).
Likewise, theICC inthenull model implied that 11.27% ofthe total variance ofgood vitamin Aintake wasduetodifferences between communities. While community variance wasexpressed astheintra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) and the median odds ratio (MOR).The MOR wasalso 2.11 (95% CI1.98.2.26).This suggests that the likelihood ofhaving achild with good vitamin Aintake was2.11 times higher when respon- dents moved from low-risk tohigh-risk communities.This hasshown asignificant heteroge- neity invitamin Aconsumption between different communities.Inthefullmodel (adjusted forindividual and community factors), thecommunity variance (community variance =0.082; SE=0.012; P-value, 0.001) remained significant butdecreased.Approximately 2.45% ofthe total variance ofgood vitamin Aintake that canbeattributed tocontextual factors remained significant even after accounting forsome contextual risk factors.
The proportional change in variance (PCV) inthismodel was80.33 percent, indicating that 80.33 percent ofthecommu- nity variance observed inthenull model wasexplained bythecommunity aswell asindividual variables. The fixed effects analysis result.The model with smaller deviance (model IV)best fits thedata and theinterpretation ofthefixed effects wasbased onthismodel.Model four was adjusted forboth individual and community-level factors.Consequently, respondents’ age group, marital status, educational status, literacy level, respondent occupation, wealth index, media exposure, children’s ageinthemonth, parity, and living Country have been significantly associated with good vitamin Aconsumption inEast Africa Countries.The odds ofgood vitamin Aconsumption among women aged 25–34 and 35–49 were increased by22% and 41% ascompared totheagegroup 15–24 (AOR =1.22;95% CI:1.13,1.32), and (AOR =1.41;95%CI:1.27,1.57) respectively.
The odds ofgood vitamin A consumption increase by20% among married ascompared toasingle (AOR =1.20; 95%CI: 1.12, 1.28). Education hasasignificant effect ontheconsumption ofvitamin Aconsumption.The odds ofgood vitamin Aconsumption among secondary education level mothers increase by15% ascompared tonon-educated mothers (AOR =1.15; 95%CI: 1.03, 1.28).The odds of good vitamin Aconsumption among literate mothers increased by18% ascompared toilliter- ate(AOR =1.18; 95%CI: 1.10, 1.27).The odds ofgood vitamin Aconsumption among moth- erswho hadoccupation increased by41% ascompared tomothers with nooccupation (AOR =1.41; 95%CI: 1.33, 1.50).The odds ofgood vitamin Aconsumption among women in themiddle and rich wealth category increase by23% and 38% ascompared towomen with poor wealth status (AOR =1.23;95%CI:1.14,1.33) and (AOR =1.38;95%CI:1.26,1.47) respec- tively.Children’s ageinmoth hadasignificant effect onthegood consumption ofvitamin A.
The odds ofgood vitamin Aconsumption among children ofageinmonths 9–11,12–17, and 18–23 were 2.91,4.46 and 4.83 times higher ascompared tochildren ofageinmonths 6–8 (AOR =2.91;95%CI:2.67,3.18), (AOR =4.46;95%CI:4.13,4.82), and (AOR =4.83;95% CI:4.45,526) respectively. The odds ofgood vitamin Aconsumption among media-exposed mothers increase by18% ascompared tomedia-non-exposed mothers (AOR =1.18;95% CI:1.11,1.26).There wasarelationship between parity and good vitamin Aconsumption.The PLOS ONEDeterminan tsofgood vitamin Aconsumption inthe12East Africa countries PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02816 81February 16,2023 6/15 Table 1.Individual and Country level distribut ionofvariables in12East Africa Countri esfrom 2008 to2017.

The magnitude ofgood vitamin Aconsumption was62.91% with a95% CIof62.37 to 63.43. This finding ishigher than from astudy done atMali DHS and Ethiopia [1,17,28].The difference inresults canbeexplained bytheeffect ofsample size, differences inthestudy popu- lation, tools used tomeasure theoutcome variables across thestudies, and study settings differences.Inthisstudy, good vitamin Aconsumption among women aged 25–34 and 35–49 was higher than among theagegroup 15–24.This might beduetothehigher agegroup might give them more chances toreceive alotofpertinent information about vitamin Aand that might lead them toconsume better than their counterparts.Furthermore, thehigher agegroup is more likely tobeemployed while studies showed that being employed wasfound toincrease thechance ofgood vitamin Aconsumption asthan non-employed ones [34,35].
This might be explained astheinformation needed toconsume vitamin Aadequately canbeeasily obtained from their colleagues; Inaddition, theemployed women were mostly educated, and it improves theuseofhealth information likeadvantages and sources ofvitamin A-rich foods. Good vitamin Aconsumption ishigher among married respondents ascompared tosingle ones.This might beattributed totheadditional chance ofgetting support from their husband and ifthehusband iseducated, better consumption ofvitamin A-rich foods islikely tooccur inthat household whereas studies showed that thepresence ofaneducated husband inthe household wasassociated with better consumption ofvitamin A[35–37].Moreover, living with ahusband may give achance toearn abetter income and strengthen thefinancial capabil- ityofthat family and that willinturn improves thecapability ofconsuming vitamin A-rich foods, which areexpensive tobeconsumed forpeople with lowincome [23].

This finding isalso supported bydifferent studies where education improves theuseof vitamin Asupplementation [11,13,28,35–37].Thus, mothers who areeducated aremore likely togetmore information about vitamin Afood sources than illiterate ones.Furthermore, good vitamin Aconsumption washigher among mothers who hadoccupa- tions than mothers with nooccupation and thisisconsistent with astudy finding [34].This might beduetotheinformation needed toconsume vitamin A-rich foods being easily obtained from their colleagues and mothers who hadoccupations aremore educated than mothers who hadnooccupation.
This study showed that good vitamin Aconsumption washigher among women inthemid- dleandrich wealth category compared towomen with poor wealth status. This finding issup- ported bystudies; [11,13,17,19,28] andthismight beduetothehigher chance ofconsumption ofVitamin Arich foods among those higher wealth status than poor wealth status asthey may notbeafford tobuyvitamin A-rich foods which areexpensive forpeople with lowincome [23].Children aged greater than 9months hadasignificant effect onthegood consumption of vitamin Athan children ofageinmonths 6–8.This issimilar toastudy finding astudy inBan- gladesh [36].This result isprobably duetothenumerous carrying attitudes ofparents regard- ingwhat types offoods they usually have tofeed their children indifferent agegroups.Table 2.(Continu ed) Individual and commun ity-level variables Models Null model Model I Model II Model III AOR (95%C I) AOR (95%CI) AOR (95%CI) AOR (95%CI) Ethiopia 0.11(0.10, 0.12) 0.12(0.10,0.

https://do i.org/10.1371/j ournal.pone .0281681.t002 PLOS ONEDeterminan tsofgood vitamin Aconsumption inthe12East Africa countries PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02816 81February 16,2023 11/15 Another explanation may bealso thereduced intake ofbreast milk with increasing age, and thebadquality ofbreast milk duetopoor nutrition ofthemother. Good vitamin Aconsumption ishigher among media-exposed mothers increase than media non-exposed mothers.This wassupported bystudies that showed that there wasaposi- tiverelationship between media exposure and vitamin Aconsumption [34,37].This isbecause theinformation needed toconsume vitamin A-rich foods canbeobtained easily through the utilization ofmedia.This study showed that good vitamin Aconsumption waslower among parity ofgreater than twoascompared toparity ofone.This wassimilar toastudy done inEthiopia that indi- cated asignificant association between smaller family sizes and good vitamin A-rich foods [28].
The possible explanation forthisfinding isduetoachallenge amother face tofeed vita- min-rich foods toalarger family than asmaller family sizeduetotheexpense ofvitamin A- rich foods. Whereas feeding vitamin-rich foods tolarge family sizes ismore challenging dueto theinflation ofthecost ofliving.Good vitamin Aconsumption among children ofage6to23months inEthiopia decreased by88% ascompared tochildren liveBurundi.The difference might beattributed duetothe difference insocioeconomic and study settings.Conclusion The magnitude ofgood vitamin Aconsumption intwelve East African countries islow.The respondents with anagegroup of25–34 and 35–49, married, literate, hadoccupation, middle and higher wealth index, have media exposure, children aged nine-month to2years, 2–4and 5+parity and different living Country wassignificantly associated with good vitamin Acon- sumption intheEast Africa Counties.
Therefore, policymakers should give dueattention to theagegroup 15–24, single, illiterate, jobless, poor wealth status, children ofageinmonths 6–8, media non-exposed mothers, and parity onetoimprove good consumption offoods rich invitamin AinEast Africa countries.
