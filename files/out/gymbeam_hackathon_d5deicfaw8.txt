Persistenceofneurologicaldamageinducedby dietaryvitaminB-12deﬁciencyininfancy UrsulavonSchenck,ChristineBender-Götze,BertholdKoletzko Abstract A case is reported of a 14 month old boywith severe dietary vitamin B-12 deﬁ-ciency caused by his mother’s vegan diet.Cinical, electroencephalography (EEG), and haematological ﬁndings are de-scribed.Cranial magnetic resonance im-aging (MRI) showed severe frontal andfrontoparietal cranial atrophy.VitaminB-12supplementsledtoarapidimprove-ment of haematological and neurologicalsymptoms.Serum vitamin B-12 and uri-narymethylmalonateexcretionwerenor-mal 10 days after treatment began.Aftersix weeks, EEG was normal and cranial MRI after 10 weeks showed complete disappearance of all structural abnor-malities.Cognitiveandlanguagedevelop-ment, however, remained seriouslyretarded at the age of 2 years.
It isconcluded that infantile vitamin B-12deﬁciency induced by maternal vegandiets may cause lasting neurodisabilityeven though vitamin B-12 supplementa-tion leads to rapid resolution of cerebralatrophy and electroencephalographic ab-normality. (ArchDisChild 1997;77:137–139) Keywords: cobalamine deﬁciency; vegetarian diets; vegandiets;psychomotordevelopment Strict vegetarian diets with avoidance of milk and egg (vegan diets) do not provide appreci-able amounts of vitamin B-12, because onlyfoods of animal origin are signiﬁcant dietarysources of the vitamin.Adults may tolerate vitamin B-12 deﬁcient diets for many yearswithout apparent symptoms due to theirendogenous stores.In contrast, infants havevery limited hepatic reserves of vitamin B-12and so may develop symptoms of deﬁciencywithin months.1Infantile vitamin B-12 deﬁ- ciency with ine Vective haematopoiesis and degeneration of nervous tissue has been reported in breast fed infants of mothers onstrict vegetarian diets.
2–7Although vitamin B-12 supplements were reported to result inrapidimprovement, 89concernhasbeenraised regarding long term development.3671 0We report a case of a 14 month old boy in whomsevere dietary vitamin B-12 deﬁciency causedpersistentneurologicaldamage. Casereport The patient was referred to the Kinderpolik-linik, University of Munich, Germany at theage of 14 months because of anaemia andsevere neurological abnormalities.His motherhad been a vegetarian for 14 years and for the past six years she had followed a strict vegandietwithahighproportionofuncookedfoodspreparedaccordingtotherulesofBurger’srawfood therapy.11The patient was exclusively breast fed until the age of 9 months,when his mother started to o Ver him dried fruits and bananas.Hetookonlysmallamountsofthese complementary foods, however, for example,one date per day.His mother reported that he developednormallyduringhisﬁrst10months;he could sit and walk with his hand held at 8and 10 months respectively.
From 12 monthsonwards, he gradually became less active andlost the ability to walk. By the age of 14months,he was unable to sit,became increas-ingly apathetic, and eventually stopped feed-ing,whichprovokedreferral.On admission he was comatose, had a high pitched cry and severe generalised muscularhypotonia.Hewasmalnourishedwithalengthof 70 cm (4 cm <3rd centile) and a weight of7.3 kg (1 kg < 3rd centile.A blood countshowed macrocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 82g/l,packedcellvolume0.245,meancorpuscu-lar volume 116.7 ﬂ).Serum ferritin was 4.0µg/l, and red blood cell folate 2018.1 nmol/l.Serum vitamin B-12 was undetectable, andmarkedlyincreasedurinaryexcretionofmeth-ylmalonate (32.4 mmol/g creatinine) con-ﬁrmed vitamin B-12 deﬁciency.The concen-tration of vitamin B-12 in his mother’s breastmilk was 0.04 µg/100 g.Samples from fourhealthy omnivorous mothers had a range of0.11–12µg/100g(DrWSchmolck,Milchwirt-schaftliche Untersuchungs und Versuchsan-stalt,Kempten,Germany).
Electroencephalography (EEG) on admis- sion was severely abnormal with absent basalrhythmic activity. Cranial magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) showed severe frontal andfrontoparietal cerebral atrophy (see ﬁg 1A),and myelinisation was considered appropriateforage.On admission, he was prescribed 250 µg of vitamin B-12 intramuscularly, after which hereceived oral treatment with 25 µg vitaminB-12/dayandsupplementalfeedingwithasoyformula, and rapidly improved.He regainedconsciousness within hours of receiving vita-min supplements.On the next day, he smiledandinteractedwithhismotherfortheﬁrsttimeinseveralweeks,hismuscletoneimproved,andheachievedheadcontrol.Heregainedtheabil-itytowalk.Bythethirddayhewasabletoeatand drink and was discharged.
His parentsinsisted that he continued a vegan diet butagreed to give him soy formula and oralvitaminB-12supplements.ArchivesofDiseaseinChildhood 1997;77:137–139 137 Kinderpoliklinik, KlinikumInnenstadtderLudwig-Maximilians-Universität,Pettenkoferstrasse8a,D-80336Munich,GermanyUvonSchenckCBender-GötzeBKoletzko Correspondenceto: ProfessorKoletzko.

1 During the ﬁrst month of life, about 0.1 µg vitamin B-12/day are needed for tissuesynthesis. 14Disregarding losses, we estimate that the body store of a normal newborn maylast for eight months.Endogenous stores maybe much lower if the baby’s mother is vitaminB-12 deﬁcient, 15which explains why Michaud et alfound biochemical signs of infantile vitamin B-12 deﬁciency by 2 months of age.12 Vitamin B-12 and folic acid are essentialcofactorsformethioninesynthesisandthusforformation of tetrahydrofolate required formethylation reactions in various metabolicpathways, including DNA synthesis.10Typical neurological symptoms of infantile vitaminB-12 deﬁciency are cerebral and optic nerveatrophy, apathy and coma, hypotonia, anddevelopmental delay.6The molecular basis for thesealterationsisnotwellunderstood.The primary functionof cobalamin(Cbl) is to provide coenzyme activity for the synthesisof methionine and succinyl-coenzyme A.
For methionine synthesis,a methyl group is trans-ferred from methyltetrahydrofolate (THF) tomethyl-Cbl. The methyl transfer to homo-cysteine ﬁnally generates methionine.Thustwo products essential for DNA synthesis arerendered:methionineandTHF.THFbecomesformyl-THF and provides C-1 units in purinesynthesis.The absence of neurological symp-tomsinfolatedeﬁciencysuggeststhatmethio-nine synthesis may not be causally related to Cblassociatedneuropathy.Attentionhasbeen focused therefore on the other Cbl dependentreaction:conversionofmethylmalonyl-CoAtosuccinyl-CoA.An inappropriate methyl-malonyl-CoAconversionresultsinanexcessofthe precursor propionyl-CoA.Propionyl-CoAaccumulationleadstooddchainfattyacidsyn-thesis, which leads to incorporation of largeamountsofunusualC15andC17fattyacidsinnervesheetswithalteredneuralfunctions.
16 Cooper and Rosenblatt claim that deﬁciency of methionine synthesis causes the neuropathy induced by vitamin B-12 deﬁciency,17and neurologicaldamagehasbeendescribedindis-turbedmethioninesynthesis 18butnotinisolated methylmanoyl-CoA mutase deﬁciency.17Allen et alsuggest that a deﬁciency in a third unknown Cbl dependent reaction is responsi-ble for Cbl associated neuropathy, 19but the mechanismremainstobeelucidated.AlthoughvitaminB-12treatmentresultsinrapidresolu-tionofhaematologicalsymptomsandmorpho-logical changes in the nervous system detect- able by fundoscopy and imaging, there is noinformation regarding biochemical and func-tional alterations of neuronal cells in vivo and other physiological functions that may beimportant for long term outcome.
It isconceivable that the long term prognosis ofinfantile vitamin B-12 deﬁciency depends ontheseverityanddurationofthedeﬁcientstate.Of the 25 cases reviewed (see table 1), sixpatientsdiagnosedatameanageof10months were found to develop normally at follow upwhilesixothersdiagnosedatameanageof13months showed persistent developmentaldelay.Initialimprovementdoesnotnecessarilyresultinafavourablelongtermoutcome(per-sonalobservation). 361 0 EVorts should be directed therefore to preventing deﬁciency in pregnant and breast feeding women on vegan diets and theirinfants.Urinary screeening for methylmalonicaciduriamaybeusefulinthisselectedpopula- tion to detect a Vected individuals.12The approachtoindividualsfollowingunusualdiets needs to be careful and considerate,aiming atstepwise introduction of small, acceptableadditions such as milk products or eggs.If dietary changes are not acceptable to parents,vitaminB-12supplementsareessential.1 Friedrich W.Handbuch der Vitamine .
