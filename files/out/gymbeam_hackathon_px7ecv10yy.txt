Methods: The anti-in ﬂammatory drug 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is a ﬁrst-line drug for ulcerative colitis (UC), however no study has explored the effects of 5-ASA on articular chondrocytes. In this work, both in vitro (chondrocyte pellets) and ex vivo (osteochondral explants) human in ﬂammatory OA models were applied to evaluate the effects of 5-ASA.Results: In the in ﬂammatory pellet model, 5-ASA remarkably downregulated the gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) while upregulating proteoglycan 4 ( PRG4 ) and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein ( COMP ) gene expression.Total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis by pellets was markedly increased in 5-ASA-treated groups compared with the in ﬂammatory group.In conditioned medium, in ﬂammatory mediators (IL-8, nitric oxide) were markedly inhibited upon 5-ASA treatment.
Moreover, histological staining showed 5-ASA retained proteoglycan content and inhibited degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) core components, aggrecan (ACAN) and collagen type II (COL2). In the in ﬂammatory explant model, 5-ASA mitigated signs of OA development by reducing in ﬂammatory mediators and GAG loss.Conclusions: These ﬁndings suggest that 5-ASA has anti-in ﬂammatory and pro-anabolic effects on human chon- drocyte pellet and osteochondral explant in ﬂammatory OA models.The translational potential of this article: Disease-modifying OA drugs are an unmet clinical need for the treatment of OA.Our study explored and demonstrated the anti-in ﬂammatory and protective effects of 5-ASA on in vitro andex vivo human in ﬂammatory OA models, showing its translational potential for OA treatment.1.Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent musculoskeletal degenera- tive disorder, causing reduced quality of life and increasing economic burden globally [ 1,2].
OA affects both small (like joints in hands) and large (like knee and hip joints) diarthrodial joints, manifesting recurrent joint pain, swelling, transient morning stiffness, and limited joint motion [1]. As a whole-joint disease, the pathology of OA involves cartilage degeneration, synovitis, and subchondral bone remodeling [ 1,3].Among the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, chronic low-grade inﬂammation plays a pivotal role in OA onset and progression [ 3].Although current widely-used drugs such as analgesics, steroids, andhyaluronic acid exhibit symptom-modifying and anti-in ﬂammatory ef- fects in basic and preclinical studies, none have shown notable clinical success in delaying or halting OA progression [ 4].On one hand, these drugs do not possess disease-modifying functions.On the other hand, effective treatment is challenged by the complexity and heterogeneity of OA, in which extensive in ﬂammation- and immunity-related signaling pathways are activated.
Thus, there is a substantial clinical need to explore novel drugs which not only target multiple in ﬂammatory path- ways in OA development but also have disease-modifying effects for OAtreatment. 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) ( Fig.1 A) has been a ﬁrst-line drug for over thirty years to treat ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic in ﬂammatory * Corresponding author.E-mail address: zhen.li@aofoundation.org (Z.Li).Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Journal of Orthopaedic Translation journal homepage: www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-orthopaedic-translation https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jot.2022.10.003 Received 4 July 2022; Received in revised form 25 August 2022; Accepted 6 October 2022 2214-031X/ ©2022 The Authors.Published by Elsevier B.V.on behalf of Chinese Speaking Orthopaedic Society.

UC and OA share some similar pathogenic mechanisms such as activated NF- κB signaling pathway [ 5,7], increased Toll-like receptor 4 [ 5,8], tumor necrosis factor- α(TNF- α)[5, 9], apoptosis [ 10,11], and oxidative stress [ 7,11].5-ASA's mechanisms of action to induce UC remission include inhibition of cyclooxygenases, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ(PPAR γ), NF- κB, and immunosuppressive effects [ 12,13].Besides its extensive anti-in ﬂammation ef ﬁcacy, oral or topical 5-ASA also owns advantages of safety and little side effects after years of formulation development [ 6].Hitherto, no studies have evaluated the effects of 5-ASA on OA.The current study aims to investigate the potential of 5-ASA for OA treatment.
In vitro and ex vivo inﬂammatory OA models with human chondrocytes and osteochondral explants were used to test the effect of 5-ASA in inhibiting in ﬂammation and mitigating OA progression. 2.Materials and methods 2.1.Reagents and 5-ASA preparation All the reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise speci- ﬁed.Dulbecco's modi ﬁed eagle medium high glucose (DMEM HG) was prepared by dissolving 13.38 g DMEM HG powder (Gibco), 3.7 g sodium bicarbonate, and 0.11 g sodium pyruvate in 1 L MilliQ water.After ﬁltering through a 0.22 μm strainer, DMEM HG was stored at 4/C14C for further use.5-ASA was ﬁrst dissolved in DMEM HG.Then, the pH of 5- ASA in DMEM (around 6.0) was adjusted with 1 M NaOH to the same pH as the DMEM HG (around 8.0).After ﬁltering through a 0.22 μm strainer, a storage concentration of 5-ASA at 40 mM was prepared for further use.2.2.
Human chondrocytes isolation and expansion Cartilage fragments were dissected from osteoarthritic knee or hip joint cartilage of patients undergoing joint replacement operations with donors ’informed consent and ethical approval by cantonal ethical commission (KEK-ZH-NR: 2010-0444/0). Demographic characteristics of included donors were shown in Table 1 .Macroscopically non-wear cartilage tissue with intact surface was minced into small pieces anddigested in spinner ﬂasks containing DMEM HG, 100 U/mL penicillin plus 100 μg/mL streptomycin (1% P/S, PAN ™Biotech), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Seraplus), and 450 U/mL collagenase II (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) for 22 h at 37/C14C and 5% CO 2.Dissociated cells were cultured in expansion medium, which consisted of DMEM HG, 1% P/S, 10% FBS, 1% nonessential amino acid (NEAA, Gibco), 1 ng/mL human transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF- β1, Fitzgerald), 5 ng/mL human ﬁbroblast growth factor basic protein (FGF-2, Fitzgerald) [ 14].
At their 80% con ﬂuency, chondrocytes of passage 0 were detached and preserved in liquid nitrogen. After thawing and expanding, passage 1 to 3 chondrocytes were used in this study.2.3.Human osteochondral explant harvest Human osteochondral explants were harvested as previously described [ 15].Demographic characteristics of included donors were shown in Table 1 .Brie ﬂy, a trephine with an 8-mm inner diameter was used to extract explants from human femoral heads of patients who un- derwent hip replacement operation with their informed consent and approval by the cantonal ethical commission (KEK-ZH-NR: 2010-0444/0).Afterwards a circular saw was applied to get explants with 7-mm height.The explants were precultured for 1 day in chon- dropermissive medium, which contained DMEM HG, 1% P/S, 1% ITS þ Premix (ITS, Corning), 1% NEAA, and 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid (AA).Figure 1.Experimental design and cell viability of chondrocytes treated with 5-ASA.A.Molecular strucutre of 5-ASA.B.

After 24-h and 48-h incubation, the medium in each well was replaced with 100 μL fresh medium and 20 μL CellTiter-Blue Reagent (Promega). After 4-h incubation, ﬂuorescence of each well was measured by microplate reader at excitation wavelength of 560 nm and emission wavelength of 590 nm.Background ﬂuorescence caused by medium was determined by average readings of wells without cells.Cell viability (%) was normalized to the average value of the Control group after 24-h incubation.2.5.Experimental design Forin vitro study ( Fig.1 B), passage 3 cells were plated in 96-well V bottom plates (Thermo Scienti ﬁc) by adding 0.25 million cells in each well and 0.25 mL chondrogenic medium, which comprised DMEM HG, 1% P/S, 1% ITS, 1% NEAA, 50 μg/mL AA, 10 ng/mL TGF- β1, 0.1 μM dexamethasone (Dex).The plates were then centrifuged at 400 G for 5 min to obtain chondrocyte micromass.
After one-week culture, pellets were randomly divided into 4 groups and supplemented with medium as follows: 1) Control: chondropermissive medium; 2) OA: chon- dropermissive medium þ1 ng/mL IL-1 β(PeproTech) þ1 ng/mL TNF- α (R&D Systems); 3) 5-ASA 10 mM: chondropermissive medium þ1 ng/mL IL-1βþ1 ng/mL TNF- αþ10 mM 5-ASA; 4) 5-ASA 20 mM: chon- dropermissive medium þ1 ng/mL IL-1 βþ1 ng/mL TNF- αþ20 mM 5- ASA. Medium was changed every 2 –3 days and collected on day 3, 6, 8, 11, and 14 for further analysis.Pellets were harvested on day 3 (short term), 8, and 14 (long term) for gene expression, biochemical, and his- tological analysis.For the ex vivo study ( Fig.1 C), explants after preculture were randomly divided into 4 groups as for the in vitro study.According to our previous study [ 15], 5 ng/mL IL-1 βin combination with 5 ng/mL TNF- α were used to induce the in ﬂammatory OA model.
Medium was changed every 1 –2 days and collected at every medium change, while explants were collected on day 7. 2.6.Gene expression analysis Total RNA from pellets was isolated using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, MRC).Two Pellets in 1 mL TRI Reagent were ﬁrst ho- mogenized by a tissue lyser.After centrifugation, 0.1 mL 1-bromo-3- chloropropane (BCP) was added into the supernatant for phase separa- tion.Aqueous phase was carefully transferred into a fresh tube followed by adding 0.25 mL isopropanol and 0.25 mL high salt precipitation so- lution (MRC).After centrifugation, the RNA precipitation was washed with 1 mL 75% ethanol for 2 times.Subsequently, RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water after centrifugation and air dried.RNA isolation from cartilage explants, as well as the following reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay were performed as previously described [15].
Brie ﬂy, 0.4 μg RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript Vilo cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher). qPCR was performed with Quant- Studio™7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).Relative gene expression levels were calculated using 2/C0ΔΔCTmethod.The primer and probe sequences of tested genes were listed in Table 2 .2.7.Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) measurement After washing in PBS, pellets were digested in 0.5 mg/mL Proteinase K (Roche) overnight at 56/C14C, then the enzyme was inactivated at 95/C14C for 10 min, and the digest frozen at /C020/C14C for GAG and DNA mea- surement.GAG content in pellets and conditioned medium were measured as previously described [ 15] with 1,9-dimethyl-methylene blue (DMMB) as color reagent and chondroitin sulfate as standard.Thetotal GAG synthesis per pellet (GAG total) during culture duration comprised GAG release into the medium (GAG medium ) and GAG content in the pellet (GAG content ), namely GAG total¼GAG medium þGAG pellet.2.8.
DNA quanti ﬁcation DNA content in pellets was measured with Bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258). Calf Thymus DNA (Invitrogen) was used to obtain a standard curve with maximum concentration at 12.5 μg/mL.Samples and stan- dards with volume of 40 μL in duplicates were pipetted into a 96-well white plate.Subsequently, 160 μL Hoechst 33258 dye solution (1 μg/ mL) was added into each well and incubated for 20 min with protection from light.Fluorescence was read at excitation wavelength of 360 nm and emission wavelength of 465 nm by microplate reader.2.9.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) The content of the in ﬂammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in medium was evaluated by ELISA (R &D Systems) according to the producer's instructions.2.10.Nitric oxide assay Nitric oxide (NO) in medium was measured by Griess Reagent System (Promega Corporation) according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.11.
Immunohistochemistry staining Snap-frozen cryosections (thickness: 10 μm for pellets, 8 μm for ex- plants) were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Samples were ﬁxed in 70% and 100% methanol subsequently for 10 min each at room temperature, then air dried overnight.Sections for aggrecan (ACAN) immunostaining were pretreated in 10 mM DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT) reduction solution for 2 h at 37/C14C and then 40 mM iodoaceta- mide alkylation solution for 1 h at 37/C14C.After washing in deionized water to remove the cryocompound, all slides were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) for 30 min to remove endogenous peroxidase.Afterwards, 1.5 U/mL hyaluronidase was used for antigen retrieval of collagen type II (COL2) at 37/C14C for 30 min, while 0.25 U/mLTable 2 Oligonucleotide primers and probes used for qPCR.

Journal of Orthopaedic Translation 38 (2023) 106 –116 108 chondroitinase ACII was applied in ACAN epitope retrieval under the same conditions. After treatment with horse serum for 1 h, sections were incubated with primary antibodies against COL2 (DSHB, CIICI; 2 μg/mL), and ACAN (DSHB, 1C6; 5 μg/mL) for 30 min at room temperature, suc- cessively followed by binding with biotinylated horse anti-mouse sec- ondary antibodies (Vector laboratories, BA-2001; 1:200) for 30 min, ABC-complex (Vector laboratories) for 30 min, and DAB (Vector labo- ratories) for 4 min.Slides incubated with PBS under the same conditions, instead of primary antibody, were as used as negative control (Neg).Nuclei were stained with Mayer's hematoxylin for 30 s.The percentage of positive stained area in the whole section was quanti ﬁed using Image J software [ 16].
Brie ﬂy, positive-stained area was automatically calculated by setting an optimal threshold conforming to its original ﬁgure, while the whole pellet area was circled manually. The percentage of positive stained area was obtained by dividing the positive stained area by the whole pellet area and then multiplying by 100.2.12.Safranin O/Fast Green staining Sections were ﬁxed with the same method as described above for IHC staining.Slides were then stained with Weigert's hematoxylin for 10 min,followed by 0.02% Fast Green for 6 min and 0.1% Safranin O for 12 min as previously described [ 15].The percentage of Safranin O-stained area in pellet section or unstained area in the explant section was quanti ﬁed using Image J software.For each pellet section, Safranin O-stained area was automatically calculated by setting an optimal threshold, while the whole pellet area was circled manually.
The ratio of Safranin O-stained area to its whole pellet area was used for the calculation of percentage value. For explant sections, the percentage of unstained area was assessed as previously described [ 15].2.13.Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.4.0.Shapiro –Wilk test was ﬁrst carried out to assess data normality in each group.One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then performed for data with normal distribution, while Kruskal –Wallis test was used for non-normally distributed data.Statistical signi ﬁcance was de ﬁned with a p<0.05.Figure 2.5-ASA regulated anabolism- and in ﬂammation-related gene expression levels of chondrocytes in pellet OA model after 3-day treatment ( COX-2 ,COMP , one- way ANOVA; IL-6,IL-8,ACAN ,PRG4 ,COL2A1 , Kruskal –Wallis test; n ¼7).Data were presented as boxplot; center line, median; box limits, 25th to 75th percentiles; whiskers, min to max.* p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001, **** p<0.0001.K.Li et al.

Journal of Orthopaedic Translation 38 (2023) 106 –116 110 3. Results 3.1.Cytotoxicity of 5-ASA on chondrocytes Cell viability of chondrocytes under stimulation of different 5-ASA concentrations was evaluated by CellTiter-Blue Reagent.After 24-h in-cubation, 5-ASA showed no toxic effects on chondrocytes, while chon- drocytes in 30 mM 5-ASA group presented a signi ﬁcant cell viability decrease in comparison to the cells without 5-ASA treatment after 48-h incubation ( Fig.1 D).Thus, 5-ASA at concentrations of 10 mM and 20 mM were applied for further studies.3.2.5-ASA modulates in ﬂammatory and anabolic gene expressions in pellet model To evaluate the early effects of 5-ASA on OA pellets at transcriptional level, pellets were collected after 3-day (short term) treatment.As shown inFig.
2 ,i nﬂammatory cytokines induced an OA-like phenotype as indicated by gene expression results, featured by decreased anabolic genes ( ACAN ,COL2A1 ,PRG4 ,COMP ) and increased in ﬂammatory genes (IL-6,IL-8,COX-2 ) in OA group in comparison with control group. 5-ASA at 20 mM sharply reduced gene expressions of IL-6and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2 ) compared with OA group.Extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes proteoglycan 4 ( PRG4 ) and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP ) were signi ﬁcantly elevated upon 20 mM 5-ASA treatment.Although not signi ﬁcant, 20 mM 5-ASA showed a trend in down- regulation of IL-8and up-regulation of ACAN andCOL2A1 gene expres- sion.Moreover, 10 mM 5-ASA presented similar regulation trends with weaker effects.3.3.5-ASA attenuates in ﬂammation in conditioned medium in pellet model Conditioned medium on day 3, 6, 8, 11, 14 (long term) was collected to analyze released in ﬂammatory mediators.
Compared with the control group, cytokines signi ﬁcantly enhanced the release of IL-6, IL-8 and NO into conditioned medium in OA group. Cumulative content of IL-8 and NO in OA group were both markedly decreased by 10 mM and 20 mM 5- ASA treatment compared with the OA group ( Fig.3 B and C).Cumulative IL-6 amount showed a similar trend of reduction in 5-ASA-treated groups although not signi ﬁcantly different from the OA group ( Fig.3 A).3.4.5-ASA promotes total GAG synthesis in pellet model Pellets were collected on day 14 (long term) to assess total GAG synthesis after long-term treatment with 5-ASA.GAG content per pellet was remarkably reduced in OA group compared with control group (Fig.4 A), while DNA content was comparable among all the groups (Fig.4 B).Compared with the OA group, GAG/DNA per pellet was signiﬁ cantly upregulated in 10 mM 5-ASA-treated group and showed a trend of increase in 20 mM 5-ASA-treated group ( Fig.4 C).Moreover, Figure 5.

5-ASA mitigates matrix loss in pellet model Histological staining was carried out to observe the extracellular matrix distribution in pellets. Proteoglycan (PG) staining by Safranin Osuggested no evident differences among all groups after 3-day treatment (Fig.5 A).After 8 and 14 days of culture, the OA group showed reduced PG staining compared with the control group, whereas the percentage of Figure 6.5-ASA reduced aggrecan degradation in pellet OA model.A.Immunohistochemistry staining of ACAN after 5-ASA treatment for 8 and 14 days.Scale bars, 100μm.Neg, negative control.B, C.Semi-quantitative analysis of ACAN immunostaining on Day 8 and Day 14 (Day 8, one-way ANOVA; Day 14, Kruskal –Wallis test; n¼3–4).Data were shown as mean þSD.* p<0.05, ** p<0.01.Figure 7.5-ASA reduced collagen type II (COL2) degradation in pellet OA model.A.Immunohistochemistry staining of COL2 after 5-ASA treatment of 8 and 14 days.Scale bars, 100 μm.Neg, negative control.B, C.

Compared with the control group, explants stimulated with IL-1 βand TNF- αshowed higher gene expression of IL-6 and IL8, and lower gene expression of ACAN andCOMP . Although not signi ﬁcantly different from the OA group, 5-ASA at 20 mM showed a trend of down-regulation on gene expression levels of IL-6andIL-8.Upregulated ACAN andCOMP gene expression compared with the OA group indicated pro-anabolic effects of 20 mM 5-ASA ( Fig.8 ).Furthermore, in ﬂammation markers of IL-6 and NO in medium were reduced upon treatment with 5-ASA at 20 mM ( Fig.9 A).Under normal culture conditions proteoglycan depletion in the super ﬁcial cartilage zone was comparable in different donors included in our study (Supplementary Fig.1 ).Histologically, the percentage of proteoglycan loss in cartilage induced by IL-1 βand TNF- αwas restored by 5-ASA at both 10 mM and 20 mM concentrations ( Fig.9 B and C).
Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest 5-ASA could inhibit in ﬂammation and mitigate cartilage degeneration in the explant in ﬂammatory OA model. 4.Discussion With the formulation development and advent of mesalazine, 5-ASA has been a standard treatment for patients with UC for over thirty years [5,6,12].5-ASA exerts multifaceted anti-in ﬂammation mechanisms of action in UC treatment.Since OA shares some common pathogenic changes with UC, we explored the effects of 5-ASA in in ﬂammatory chondrocytes and cartilage explants.In most previous studies, only single IL-1βor TNF- αwas used to induce in ﬂammatory OA models.As both cytokines are critical mediators controlling cartilage degeneration [ 9], in this study the combination of IL-1 βand TNF- αwas applied to induce models closer to the native OA microenvironment [ 17,18].Moreover, the use of human-derived chondrocytes and explants could facilitate the translation of 5-ASA into clinical practice.Figure 8.
5-ASA upregulated anabolic gene expression and downregualated in ﬂammatory gene expression of chondrocytes in explant OA model after 7 days treatment (n ¼3–4). Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal –Wallis test.Data were presented as boxplot; center line, median; box limits 25th to 75th percentiles; whiskers, min to max.* p<0.05.K.Li et al.Journal of Orthopaedic Translation 38 (2023) 106 –116 113 For clinical practice, various anti-in ﬂammatory drugs have been developed for OA treatment.Oral selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors such as celecoxib are common agents, although they have been associ- ated with considerable gastrointestinal and cardiovascular complications and show no disease modifying effects [ 1].Intra-articular corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid could alleviate short-term joint pain presumably because of their anti-in ﬂammatory actions; however, both lack disease modifying ef ﬁcacy [ 1].
Emerging biologic agents targeting IL-1 β, TNF, β-nerve growth factor ( β-NGF) or inhibiting nitrogen oxide have repeatedly revealed disappointing results from clinical trials [ 19]. These results indicate that blocking only one cytokine may not be suf ﬁcient to counteract OA progression [ 19].Besides IL-1 βand TNF, other cytokines like IL-6 are also appealing targets which have been detected in osteo- arthritic cartilage and synovial ﬂuid [ 20].In this preclinical study, 5-ASA inhibited multiple targets (COX-2, IL-6, IL-8, and NO) and enhanced the synthesis of several ECM markers (ACAN, COMP, PRG4, COL2) in both inﬂammatory pellet and explant models, demonstrating its broad and potent effects of anti-in ﬂammation and pro-anabolism.Under the extensive in ﬂammatory cascades in chondrocytes induced by IL-1 βin combination with TNF- α, 5-ASA showed a remarkable downregulation of in ﬂammatory markers in pellet model.
Though mean values were reduced in 5-ASA groups in comparison to the OA group, gene expression of IL-8and cumulative release of IL-6 only presented a downregulation trend without statistical signi ﬁcance. Large inter-donor variations among the samples from clinical patients may contribute to statistically insigni ﬁcant comparison.In the pellet model, the expressionof matrix molecules like ACAN, PRG4 and COMP were all upregulated upon 5-ASA treatment, which was further supported by Safranin O staining and histological analysis of ACAN.In 5-ASA-treated groups, the ECM protein COL2 only had a regaining trend without statistical signif- icance transcriptionally, while remarkable differences were observed in immunohistochemistry staining.On one hand, the bioprocess of tran- scription responds more rapidly to extracellular in ﬂammatory stimula- tion, while protein translation generally represents a delayed reaction.
In our study, the tested gene expression levels varied signi ﬁcantly between the groups after 3-day (short term) treatment, while Safranin O staining still showed no differences. On the other hand, mRNA usually represents a transient status, whereas ECM proteins resulted from their cumulative synthesis or breakdown during culture duration.These reasons might cause the discrepancy of ECM markers between mRNA and protein levels.In our pellet study, GAG content in medium of the control group was much higher than that in the OA group, seemingly contrary to the fact that GAG levels in synovial ﬂuid of OA patients parallel their cartilage degeneration [ 21].Unlike authentic native cartilage tissue, chondrocyte pellets consist only of cells prone to form cartilaginous structure.Withthis purpose, the GAG anabolism in pellets ran at a relatively high level in the control group, while the matrix structure required to retain the synthesized GAG was still not established.
In ﬂammation disrupted this balance predominantly by inhibiting GAG synthesis. Therefore, in the OA group less GAG was released into the medium.However, the ratio of GAG in medium to total GAG synthesis was still higher in the OA group than that in the control group, showing in ﬂammation could impair GAG Figure 9.5-ASA attentuated OA progerssion in in ﬂammatory OA model established with human osteochondral explants.A.Cumulative content of IL-6, IL-8, and NO released in conditioned medium (n ¼3–4).B.Representative images of Safranin O/Fast Green staining of the cartilage after 7 days.Scale bars, 200 μm.Yellow dotted line separates the non- or weakly stained super ﬁcial area from the intensely stained deep area in cartilage.C.Semi-quantitative analysis of Safranin O staining (n ¼3).Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA.Data were shown as mean þSD.

In this research, we not only applied two classical cytokines simultaneously, but also with multiple repetitions every 2 –3 days, leading to constant com- bined effects that may be stronger compared to previous in vitro and in vivostudies. Though some potential drugs may be missed out under these harsh in ﬂammatory conditions during preclinical drug screening, our models should facilitate the selection of drugs with superior treatment effects and higher translation potential.To further investigate its application in human native cartilage tissue, we evaluated the effects of 5-ASA on in ﬂammatory osteochondral ex- plants extracted from human hip joints.Under in ﬂammatory conditions, inﬂammation- ( IL-6,IL-8) and anabolism-related ( ACAN ,COMP ) gene expression levels in cartilage showed an improved trend upon 5-ASA treatment.Moreover, 5-ASA decreased upregulated in ﬂammation medi- ators (IL-6, NO) in medium and maintained proteoglycan staining in cartilage.
However, the applicability of 5-ASA still needs to be further evaluated, since only 4 donors were included to date. Side effects of 5- ASA, a therapeutic active agent in sulfasalazine, in humans have been minimized with years of formulation development [ 6].Moreover, as a clinically approved ﬁrst-line drug for mild and moderate UC for years, wide applicability of 5-ASA in heterogeneous populations has been tested [5].Oral administration of 5-ASA is quite common and suitable for pa- tients with UC, whereas articular cartilage is an avascular and aneural tissue in a joint cavity ﬁlled with synovial ﬂuid, which makes oral drugs hard to reach the diarthrodial joint with high concentration.Neverthe- less, intra-articular drug injection can be a great alternative to deliver drugs which target cartilage, as is shown by widely-used intra-articular injected sodium hyaluronate and betamethasone for patients with joint disorders.
Similarly, it might be preferable to apply 5-ASA by intra-articular injection, instead of oral administration, to increase its concentration in joints and reduce its side effects. Though half-life of the drug in the joint could be tested in an in vivo small animal study, the anatomy and biomechanics of cartilage in small animals (thickness 30 μm in mice, 100 μm in rats) are considered quite different from human's (thickness 2.2 mm) [ 22], sometimes making ﬁndings on effective doses not bene ﬁcial for clinical translation.Therefore, a cutting-edge controlled drug delivery system may be needed and should be helpful to retain a high concentration of 5-ASA in the joint if it shows a great efﬁcacy [ 23].There also exist some limitations in our study.The most effective concentration of 5-ASA varied depending on the assays or markers, which needs more careful consideration about the optimal 5-ASA dose for clinical translation.
Though total GAG could be restored by 20 mM 5- ASA, the GAG retention could not, demonstrating its limitation in anti- catabolism, which may be compensated by combination drug therapy. Moreover, the underlying mechanism of action of 5-ASA should also be explored in future studies, as well as its retention and penetration in cartilage in vivo .In summary, our ﬁndings reveal that 5-ASA has anti-in ﬂammatory and pro-anabolic effects on human in vitro and ex vivo inﬂammatory OA models, which may be considered as a promising drug candidate for local OA treatment.Authorship K.H.Li, S.Grad, and Z.Li contributed to the design of the study; K.H.Li, and Z.Li contributed to the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of the data; K.H.Li drafted the manuscript; Y.Zhu, P.H.Zhang, M.Alini, S.Grad, and Z.Li revised the manuscript critically; and all the authors provided approval for publication of the content.Funding This study was funded by AO Foundation.
