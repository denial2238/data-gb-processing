Methods Forty participants with NAFLD (mean age: 32.4 ± 8.2 years) were randomly assigned to one of four groups for 12 weeks: placebo (PLB), VES, PLB + RT, and VES + RT. VES was administered at 800 IU/day in a double-blind manner.The RT regimen included eight exercises at 60–80% of one-repetition maximum (1RM), with three sets of 8–12 repetitions, performed three times per week.Pre- and post-intervention assessments included body composition, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lipid profile, glycemic control, CTRP-2, CTRP-9, and 1RM evaluations.Results Following the interventions, there was a significant improvement in body composition, lipid profile, glycemic control, and 1RM indices in the exercise groups compared to non-exercise groups ( p < 0.05).AST and ALT levels decreased in all groups ( p < 0.05) compared to the PLB group.There was also a significant difference between the VES + RT group and both the VES and PLB + RT groups ( p < 0.05).
CTRP-2 and CTRP-9 levels decreased in the exercise groups compared to non-exercise groups ( p < 0.05), and their changes showed a marked correlation with body composition, lipid profile, and glycemic control indices ( p < 0.05). Conclusions This study highlights the benefits of RT on various health parameters among NAFLD patients.While adding VES to RT resulted in greater decreases in aminotransferases, it did not provide further improvements in other variables.Additionally, enhancements in body composition, lipid profile, and glycemic control indices were possibly associated with decreased levels of CTRPs.Effects of 12-weeks resistance training and vitamin E supplementation on aminotransferases, CTRP-2, and CTRP-9 levels in males with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a double-blind, randomized trial Irfan Varmazyar1, Amir Abbas Monazzami1*, Mozhgan Moradi2 and Andrew J McAinch3 Page 2 of 12 Varmazyar et al.
BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024) 16:185 Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the accumulation of excess fat in hepatocytes (steato - sis) in the absence of significant alcohol consumption or other chronic liver diseases [ 1]. Inflammation, hepa - tocyte damage, and apoptosis are hallmarks of NAFLD, potentially leading to severe complications such as cir - rhosis and liver cancer [ 2].Various factors contribute to the development and progression of NAFLD, including increased abdominal fat, insulin resistance (IR), hyper - tension, abnormal lipid levels, aging, and low physical activity [ 3].The multihit hypothesis posits that IR is the primary driver of NAFLD, resulting in increased absorp - tion and synthesis of free fatty acids (FFAs) and subse - quent steatosis [ 4].
Additionally, markers such as lipid profile, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransfer - ase (ALT) play crucial roles in assessing NAFLD sever - ity and prognosis [ 5]. The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), derived from the logarithmic ratio of triglycerides (TG) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL), has emerged as a potential diagnostic marker for NAFLD [ 6].The AIP , body mass index (BMI), and ALT level constitute a simple screening and management model for NAFLD [ 7].The global prevalence of NAFLD has increased in tandem with the increase in metabolic syndrome (MetS), obesity, and diabetes, affecting approximately one-quarter of the global population [ 8].Current estimates suggest a preva - lence ranging from 23 to 32%, with projections indicating global escalation [ 9].C1Q/TNF-related proteins (CTRPs) constitute a family of 15 members with diverse roles in lipid and carbohy - drate metabolism regulation [ 10].
CTRP-2, which shares 42% amino acid similarity with the globular C1q domain of adiponectin, is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue [ 11]. Studies in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice indicate that upregulated CTRP-2 expression mitigates severe IR and obesity development [ 12].Compared with control mice, CTRP-2-overexpressing transgenic mice exhibit improved lipid tolerance and enhanced insulin sensitiv - ity (IS) [ 13].CTRP-9, with 54% similarity to the globu - lar C1q domain of adiponectin, is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue [ 14].Overexpression of CTRP-9 in ob/ ob mice significantly reduces blood glucose and insulin levels [ 15].Conversely, CTRP-9 deficiency in mice results in increased body weight (BW), food intake, and appe - tite stimulation, leading to liver steatosis and IR [ 16, 17].
Inducing CTRP-9 production may therefore be a promis - ing approach for alleviating hepatic steatosis [ 14].Lifestyle modification forms the cornerstone of NAFLD management, targeting BW control and metabolic disor - ders [ 2]. Both aerobic (AT) and resistance training (RT) have been shown to reduce hepatic steatosis in NAFLD patients [ 18].RT, in particular, offers metabolic ben - efits with lower energy expenditure, making it feasible for individuals with lower cardiorespiratory fitness lev - els who may not tolerate AT [ 19, 20].Zelber-Sagi et al.(2014) demonstrated significant reductions in steatosis and improvements in body composition following three months of RT in NAFLD patients [ 21].Despite lifestyle modifications, medical treatment may be necessary for some patients, particularly those with advanced disease [2].
Increased oxidative stress (OS) and impaired anti - oxidant defense mechanisms are implicated in NAFLD progression, leading to antioxidant treatments such as vitamin E [ 2, 22]. Sanyal et al.(2010) reported significant improvements in steatosis, inflammation, and the resolu - tion of NASH symptoms following 96 weeks of vitamin E supplementation (VES; 800 IU/day) in nondiabetic, non - cirrhotic NAFLD patients [ 23].The primary objective of this study was to therefore assess changes in aminotransferases, CTRP-2, CTRP-9, and IR following 12 weeks of RT combined with VES in males with NAFLD.Additionally, the study evaluated the effects of these interventions on body composition, met - abolic components, and muscle strength.Materials and methods Study design and participants This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial utilized a 2 × 4 factorial design and was conducted from October 2022 to March 2023.
The study population con - sisted of participants diagnosed with NAFLD confirmed by ultrasonography [ 24]. The inclusion criteria were indi - viduals aged 18–45 years with a BMI ranging from 25 to 40 kg/m2.Exclusion criteria encompassed diabetes, cir - rhosis, hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, prostate diseases, consumption of ≥ 30 g of alcohol/day for three consecu - tive months, use of drugs known to increase aminotrans - ferases, regular sports activity in the three months prior to the study [ 25], and joint-muscular injuries or cardiore - spiratory and renal conditions.The sample size calculation was performed using Eq.1 [26–29], with a significance level set at 0.05 and a sta - tistical power of 80%.
This calculation utilized the stan - dard deviation (σ) of the primary research variable, as reported in previous studies, with CTRP-9 identified as Trial registration Registered retrospectively in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20220601055056N1) on December 21, 2023.

Randomization was con - ducted using a simple method with numbered opaque sealed envelopes, as described by Doig and Simpson [ 31]. In summary, forty standard-size sheets of paper were divided into four categories, each containing ten papers labeled with the intervention types.The papers were folded, placed in sealed envelopes, shuffled for random - ization, and assigned a number from 1 to 40.Participants were allocated to their intervention groups based on their recruitment sequence.Both participants and research - ers were blinded to the type of supplements consumed after assignment to the interventions.Participants were instructed to maintain their regular dietary habits, and there were no significant differences in baseline char - acteristics among the four groups.All participants pro - vided written informed consent after being briefed on the study’s methods and objectives.
The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Razi University of Kermanshah (IR.RAZI.REC.1401.030) and registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials Table 1 Demographic characteristics of participants Parameter (unit) PLB ( n = 9) VES ( n = 9) PLB + RT ( n = 10) VES + RT ( n = 9) Age (yrs) 32.8 ± 8.2 36.5 ± 6.3 31.6 ± 9.3 28.7 ± 7.9 Height (m) 1.75 ± 0.06 1.74 ± 0.03 1.76 ± 0.07 1.75 ± 0.05 Body weight (kg) 99.45 ± 13.44 102.96 ± 13.92 105.54 ± 16.35 97.87 ± 7.77 BMI (kg/m2) 32.04 ± 3.04 33.87 ± 4.51 33.68 ± 3.15 31.65 ± 2.34 PLB: Placebo; VES: Vitamin E Supplementation; RT: Resistance Training; BMI: Body Mass Index Fig. 1 Flowchart of trial participants.One participant each from the PLB, VES, and VES + RT groups withdrew due to personal issues, irregular supplement consumption, and irregular participation in exercise sessions, respectively.PLB: Placebo; VES: Vitamin E Supplementation; RT: Resistance Training Page 4 of 12 Varmazyar et al.
BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024) 16:185 (IRCT20201129049525N1)” .This study was also adhered to CONSORT guidelines. Ultrasound evaluations NAFLD diagnosis was confirmed via ultrasound at the Bustan Clinic in Kermanshah.Participants fasted for at least eight hours prior to assessment, and results were interpreted by a specialist using the MyLab Eight ultra - sound system (Esaote, Italy).Diagnosis relied on liver parenchymal echogenicity and visualization of vessels and the diaphragm [ 32].Body composition evaluations Body composition Evaluations followed the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) [ 33] guidelines at the Sports Sciences Laboratory of Razi University while participants were fasting.Height was measured with a stadiometer (Seca, Germany).Weight and body fat per - centage (BFP; via bioelectrical impedance) was recorded using the Zeus 9.9 body composition evaluation device (Jawon Medical, South Korea).
Abdominal and hip cir - cumferences were measured using a tape measure and the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was calculated accordingly. Biochemical evaluations Blood samples (5 ml) were obtained from the right bra - chial vein following a 12-hour fast and centrifuged at 1500 g for 15 min.Subsequently, serum levels of AST, ALT, TG, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol (TC), and glu - cose were determined via standardized enzymatic assays on an automated analyzer (Hitachi, Japan) with Pars Azmoun kits (Pars Azmoun, Iran).Serum insulin lev - els were assessed via ELISA according to manufacturers instructions (Monobind, USA), with a sensitivity of 0.75 µIU/ml and a measurement range of 0.75-25 µIU/ml.CTRP-2 and CTRP-9 serum levels were measured via ELISA according to manufacturers instructions (BT LAB, China), with sensitivities of 0.26 ng/ml and 1.15 ng/L, respectively, and measurement ranges of 0.56-36 ng/ml and 2-600 ng/L, respectively.
Additionally, AIP , homeo - stasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), and quanti - tative IS check index (QUICKI) were calculated using previously published protocols [ 34, 35]. Therapeutic interventions Supplementation Participants received supplements in a double-blind manner.The VES and VES + RT groups were adminis - tered a daily dose of 800 IU dl-alpha-tocopherol, divided into two 400 IU doses with lunch and dinner [ 36].Con - versely, the PLB and PLB + RT groups received two gela - tin capsules containing edible paraffin, resembling the appearance of vitamin E capsules.Participants in both groups were instructed to maintain consistent physical activity levels throughout the study.Compliance with the vitamin E and placebo regimens was monitored every four weeks through participant-recorded sheets, with adherence to supplementation exceeding 90% of the total supplementation days.
The supplementation period lasted for 12 weeks, and both participants and research - ers were unblinded at the end of the interventions. Exercise + supplementation Participants in the PLB + RT and VES + RT groups under - went a 12-week structured RT program combined with vitamin E or placebo consumption.The RT sessions fol - lowed ACSM guidelines for healthy adults [ 37] and were held three nonconsecutive days per week at the Razi Uni - versity weight room.Each session included a 15-minute warm-up with stationary cycling and dynamic move - ments, followed by a 40-45-minute primary exercise regi - men.Exercises included machine chest press, wide-grip lat pull-down, machine shoulder press, biceps cable curl, cable triceps push-down, leg extension, leg press, and leg curls.Participants completed three sets of 8–12 repeti - tions for each exercise at 60–80% of their one-repetition maximum (1RM).
After each session, a five-minute cool- down phase of static stretching exercises was performed (Table 2). Adherence to RT sessions exceeded 90% of the total sessions.To determine the 1RM, participants completed an indirect 1RM test, which is considered safe for those less experienced in RT.This involved identifying a load within 3–5 sets that allowed them to complete six correct repetitions (i.e., 6RM) [ 38].1RM values were then cal - culated using the Berzyski formula [ 39].After six weeks of training, the 1RM test was repeated to adjust train - ing intensity for the exercise groups.
Prior to starting the main exercises, participants underwent several thorough familiarization sessions with the training protocol.Table 2 Resistance training program Week Load (1RM%) Sets ( n) Reps range ( n) Rest (min) 1 60 3 8–12 1–3 2 65 3 8–12 1–3 3 70 3 8–12 1–3 4 65 3 8–12 1–3 5 70 3 8–12 1–3 6 75 3 8–12 1–3 7 70 3 8–12 1–3 8 75 3 8–12 1–3 9 80 3 8–12 1–3 10 75 3 8–12 1–3 11 80 3 8–12 1–3 12 75 3 8–12 1–3 1RM: One-Repetition Maximum Page 5 of 12 Varmazyar et al.

This study pioneers exploring the combined impacts of RT and VES in patients with NAFLD. The key findings indicate that RT significantly improves body composition, biochemical, and hormonal parameters in these patients.Although VES was effective in lowering aminotransferases, it did not offer additional benefits beyond RT.Body composition and muscle strength Exercise groups significantly improved body composition consistent with Zelber-Sagi et al.who reported reduc - tions in BW, BMI, and BFP in patients with NAFLD after three months of RT [ 21].RT programs can significantly reduce BFP in individuals who are overweight or obese, regardless of age or sex [ 40].Potential mechanisms for RT’s effect on abdominal fat include increased resting metabolic rate, improved IS, and enhanced sympathetic activity [ 41].This is crucial since liver fat infiltration closely correlates with abdominal fat [ 42].
Therefore, RT’s ability to boost energy expenditure during recovery and muscle regeneration [ 41] likely improved body composi - tion in the RT groups. Additionally, our results indicate no further benefits of VES on body composition indices, consistent with a meta-analysis by Emami et al., which reported no significant effect of VES on weight, BMI, and waist circumference [ 43].The RT protocol significantly increased the 1RM in the exercise groups consistent with previous findings [44].Generally, adaptation to RT becomes evident after eight to 12 weeks, attributed to specific neuromuscu - lar, connective tissue, and hypertrophy-related changes [45].Importantly, VES provided no additional strength gain in the VES + RT group, and there was a significant decrease in 1RM in the VES group, possibly due to less motivation to reach their maximum strength.A meta- analysis by Clifford et al.
evidenced that VES alone or combined with vitamin C neither enhances nor blunts exercise-induced training adaptations, including changes in aerobic capacity and muscle strength [ 46]. However, Betik et al.reported a significant 50% increase in exer - cise endurance in sedentary, diet-induced obese rats following supplementation with tocotrienols [ 47].This discrepancy highlights the need for more research on the effects of different antioxidants on exercise performance.Future studies should consider whether supplementation is more beneficial in states of antioxidant deficiency or inadequate intake.Lipid Profile The lipid profile improved significantly in the exercise groups, although HDL levels remained unchanged.Bac - chi et al.also observed a significant decrease in TG levels after four months of RT in individuals with Type 2 Diabe - tes (T2D) and NAFLD [ 48].Conversely, Venojärvi et al.
did not find a significant change in AIP levels following 12 weeks of RT in males who were overweight and obese, despite a decreasing trend [ 49].

BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024) 16:185 also commonly seen in patients with NAFLD [ 50].Exer - cise interventions can improve lipid profile, primarily by affecting peripheral tissues such as the liver [ 51].One possible mechanism for reducing plasma lipid levels in RT groups is the improved activity of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase and lipoprotein lipase [ 51].
Notably, VES provided no additional benefit in lipid profile improve - ment, consistent with Hendarto et al. ‘s findings, which reported no significant difference in the lipid profile of adolescents with obesity after two months of VES [ 52].Glycemic Control Glycemic control indices improved significantly in the exercise groups, consistent with Charatcharoenwitthaya et al., who observed enhanced IR/IS after 12 weeks of RT in patients with NAFLD [ 53].However, Zelber-Sagi et al.did not find significant changes in glucose, insu - lin, and HOMA-IR levels after three months of RT in patients with NAFLD [ 21].
RT has been reported to improve hyperglycemia mainly in patients with disturbed glucose metabolism or diabetes [ 21, 54], though some Table 5 Correlation between changes in aminotransferases and CTRPs with BMI, AIP , and HOMA-IR BMI ( n = 37) AIP ( n = 37) HOMA-IR ( n = 37) AST 0.449 **0.551 **0.422 ** ALT 0.301 0.396 *0.503 ** CTRP-2 0.5 **0.383 *0.388 * CTRP-9 0.604 **0.624 **0.661 ** Significant correlations are indicated as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 BMI: Body Mass Index; AIP: Atherogenic Index of Plasma; HOMA-IR : Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance; AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase; ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase; CTRPs : C1Q/TNF-Related Proteins Fig. 2 Pre- to post-training changes in serum levels.Changes in serum levels from pre- to post-training for ( A) Aspartate Aminotransferase, ( B) Ala - nine Aminotransferase, ( C) C1q/TNF-Related Protein-2, and ( D) C1q/TNF-Related Protein-9 across the study groups are shown.
Data are presented as means ± standard deviations. Significant differences compared to PLB: &p < 0.01; significant differences compared to VES: †p < 0.05, ‡p < 0.01; significant differences compared to PLB + RT: ◇p < 0.05, ±p < 0.01.PLB: Placebo; VES: Vitamin E Supplementation; RT: Resistance Training Page 9 of 12 Varmazyar et al.BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024) 16:185 studies have shown significant glycemic improvements in healthy individuals as well [ 55], confirming RT’s effective - ness across different populations.Our study’s results are significant because NAFLD is strongly associated with both hepatic and adipose tissue IR, as well as reduced whole-body IS [ 56].RT can improve glucose and insulin homeostasis by increasing lean body mass and enhanc - ing muscle metabolic properties, including higher density of glucose transporter type 4, glycogen synthase content/ activity, and insulin-mediated glucose clearance [ 41].
Our findings also suggest that VES provided no additional benefit over placebo in glycemic control. A meta-analysis by Asbaghi et al.concluded that VES can be effective in improving glycemic control in people with diabetes [ 57].Considering that our participants were not diabetic may explain these contrasting results.Aminotransferases Aminotransferases levels improved significantly in all groups except the PLB group.Similarly, Shamsoddini et al.observed significant reductions in AST and ALT among males with NAFLD after eight weeks of RT [ 58].Changes in IS, circulatory lipids, and energy balance are possible mechanisms underlying the change in hepatic fat following exercise training [ 59].In the current study, we found a significant correlation between changes in aminotransferases and BMI, AIP , and HOMA-IR.These changes likely contributed to enhanced liver oxidation and lowered aminotransferase levels.
Our results are also consistent with Yakaryilmaz et al., who demonstrated significant AST and ALT decreases following 24 weeks of VES in patients with NASH [ 60]. MetS can increase the delivery of FFAs to the liver, resulting in high OS due to oxidative phosphorylation of FFAs.High OS creates an environment rich in reactive oxygen species that can cause hepatocyte injury [ 61].Vitamin E, a major lipid- soluble antioxidant with anti-inflammatory activities, targets OS components and is a promising therapeutic approach for NAFLD [ 62].In a long-term study, Sanyal et al.demonstrated histological improvements in patients with NASH after 96 weeks of VES, with decreases in liver steatosis and ALT [ 23], indicating a relationship between histological and aminotransferase improve - ments.We also observed significant AST/ALT improve - ments in our VES group, possibly due to liver histological improvements.
Additionally, significant differences were observed between the VES + RT group and both the VES and PLB + RT groups, suggesting that adding vitamin E to RT provided additional benefits in lowering aminotrans - ferases in patients with NAFLD over the 12-week study period.C1Q/TNF-Related proteins CTRP-2 and CTRP-9 levels decreased significantly in the exercise groups. While acute bouts of aerobic and high- intensity interval training have been linked to increased CTRP-9 levels [ 63, 64], the chronic effects of exercise on CTRP-2 and CTRP-9 are controversial.Jerobin et al.and Hasegawa et al.found no significant changes in these components after AT in individuals within normal weight ranges or classified as overweight [ 27, 65].Conversely, Sadeghi et al.reported a significant increase in CTRP-9 following 12 weeks of AT and RT in males with T2D [ 66].In obese mice, increased expression of CTRP-2 suggests a compensatory mechanism [ 12].
Additionally, overex - pression of CTRP-9 in transgenic mice has been associ - ated with improved glucose homeostasis and enhanced fat oxidation in skeletal muscle mitochondria, leading to reductions in BW, fasting insulin, and blood glucose levels [ 14]. Structurally and functionally similar to adipo - nectin, CTRP-2, and CTRP-9 exhibit identical expression patterns and responses to metabolic changes [ 11, 14].Given the inverse relationship between adiponectin levels and obesity [ 67], the increased CTRP-2 and CTRP-9 lev - els in individuals with obesity may represent a compen - satory response to decreased adiponectin levels.In this study, we found a significant correlation between changes in CTRPs and BMI, AIP , and HOMA-IR.Improvements in BMI, AIP , and HOMA-IR following RT likely contrib - uted to a rebalancing of adipokines, potentially leading to decreased CTRP-2 and CTRP-9 levels.However, this hypothesis needs further research to validate it.
More - over, since VES had no significant effect on BMI, AIP , and HOMA-IR, it provided no additional benefit in lowering CTRPs levels either. Study strengths and limitations The study has notable strengths, including the combi - nation of RT and VES and the assessment of CTRPs in NAFLD patients.However, there are several limitations to consider.The relatively small sample size may affect the study’s power and generalizability, so results should be interpreted with caution.Future research with larger cohorts could provide more robust insights.The diagno - sis of NAFLD was based on ultrasound, which lacks the histological detail of liver examination.Additionally, we did not monitor participants’ dietary regimens during the study period, and the long-term effects of the inter - ventions were not assessed.The study also did not mea - sure other important factors, such as adiponectin, which could provide further insights into changes in CTRPs.
Conclusions In conclusion, our study underscores the effectiveness of RT as a therapeutic option for NAFLD patients, dem - onstrating benefits in body composition, lipid profile, Page 10 of 12 Varmazyar et al. BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024) 16:185 glycemic control, and aminotransferase levels.Although the addition of VES to RT resulted in further decreases in aminotransferases, it did not provide additional ben - efits for other study variables.Our results also highlight the link between improved body composition, lipid pro - file, and glycemic control with reductions in CTRP-2/ CTRP-9 levels, suggesting a compensatory role for these proteins in metabolic diseases like NAFLD.However, further research is needed to validate these findings.
