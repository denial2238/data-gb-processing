Received: May 17, 2024; Accepted: Jun. 20, 2024 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea547 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgPREFACE The 2023 Diabetes Clinical Practice Guidelines, developed by the Korean Diabetes Association (KDA), aim to provide evi - dence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment of diabetes and its complications (Table 1).The target population for these guidelines includes adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), pediatric and adolescent patients with T2DM, gestational diabetes, and adults with prediabetes.
The guidelines have been restructured and updated from the ‘2021 Diabetes Management Guideline’ to serve as a compre - hensive resource for a wide range of healthcare professionals in - volved in diabetes care, including general physicians, specialists, private practitioners, diabetes care physicians in educational in - stitutions, nurses, nutritionists, exercise therapists, social work - ers, policy makers and other professionals. By promoting effec - tive treatments, providing alternatives to risky or unnecessary interventions, and incorporating essential information on cru - cial aspects of diabetes care, these guidelines strive to enhance the overall quality of diabetes care in Korea, optimize patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs.Ultimately, the guide - lines aim to empower healthcare professionals to make in - formed decisions and deliver the best possible care to patients with diabetes, thereby improving their quality of life and reduc - ing mortality rates.
Composition and role of multidisciplinary groups for the development of guidelines The writing committee comprised a diverse group of qualified experts to ensure comprehensive coverage of both T1DM and T2DM guidelines. The committee included diabetes special -ists, nurses, nutritionists, and social workers, as well as experts from various research societies under the KDA, focusing on exercise, neuropathy, nephropathy, geriatric diabetes, gesta - tional diabetes, pancreas transplantation, and fatty liver dis - ease.Additionally, experts from relevant specialist societies, such as the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, the Korean Ophthalmological Society, the Korean Society for the Study of Obesity, the Korean Society of Hypertension, and the Korean Society of Paediatric Endocrinology, were involved.The work - ing committee members of the KDA and the director of the Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee also participated in the guideline development process.
Experts in guideline devel - opment methodology (systematic review experts) were also included to ensure a rigorous and evidence-based approach. The committee members were assigned roles based on their areas of expertise to derive recommendations and draft initial proposals using the evidence extracted from the research.Target users of the guidelines The target users of these guidelines include general practitio - ners, practicing physicians, specialists, physicians treating dia - betes patients in educational institutions, nurses in clinics and educational institutions, nutritionists, social workers, and oth - er diabetes care professionals.The guidelines are intended for use in primary, secondary, and tertiary medical institutions, as well as outpatient and inpatient settings.
The detailed fields of target users encompass general physicians, family medicine physicians, pediatricians, internal medicine physicians (endo - crinology, nephrology, cardiology, geriatrics, etc.), hospitalists, orthopedic surgeons, ophthalmologists, obstetricians, and gy - necologists, among others.Table 1.

The subcommittee reported that a FPG level of 110 mg/dL corresponds to a 2-hour plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL. However, because of the absence of large epidemiolog - ic studies that suggest the level of FPG that can predict the in - cidence of diabetic complications in Koreans, it is reasonable, as suggested in the KDA guidelines, to set the diagnostic crite - rion for diabetes at a FPG level of 126 mg/dL or higher, and the normal FPG standard as less than 100 mg/dL, similar to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) [3-5].Oral glucose tolerance test The OGTT is a test method that is cumbersome, time-consum - ing, has low reproducibility, and is relatively high in cost.Be - cause of this, it is difficult to recommend it uniformly for diabe - tes diagnosis in primary healthcare centers.
However, Korean adults with diabetes are less obese than their Western counter - parts, have relatively low insulin secretion capacity, and often only present with postprandial hyperglycemia, especially in the elderly. Therefore, screening with FPG alone may miss diagnos - ing diabetes in a significant number of cases.In contrast, lower - ing the FPG cutoff to overcome the issue reduces diagnostic specificity.The OGTT commonly uses the World Health Organization (WHO) method, which involves blood collection at fasting and 2 hours after a 75-g glucose load [6,7].The Japanese Dia - betes Society (JDS) recommends simultaneous measurement of plasma glucose and insulin at 30 and 60 minutes after a glu - cose load, along with fasting and 2-hour measurements [8].Although a fasting and 2-hour postprandial test may be more convenient, additional tests at 30, 60, and 90 minutes may be necessary [9].Specific methods for OGTT based on the WHO recommendations [7] are shown in Table 3.
Individual national diabetes societies or associations and in - ternational organizations generally recommend OGTT for peo - ple with IFG despite subtle differences between countries. The IDF recommends an OGTT to diagnose diabetes if FPG levels are 100 to 125 mg/dL and also recommends FPG measurement or OGTT if random glucose levels are 100 to 199 mg/dL [3,4].Considering the recommendations of other countries and the characteristics of diabetes in the Korean population, the KDA recommends that OGTT be conducted for patients with IFG, high diabetes risks despite showing normal FPG levels, and individuals over 60 for whom FPG may not be a practical diagnostic test, equivocal blood glucose test results, pregnant individuals, and in epidemiologic studies [1,2,10,11].OGTT is also helpful for diagnosing IGT, which is a high-risk condition for diabetes.IGT is more common than IFG and is associated with more cardiovascular events and overall mortality.
As ap - propriate interventions can prevent the progression of T2DM 1. DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETES MELLITUS 1.Normal blood glucose level The normal 8-hour fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level is <100 mg/dL, and the normal 2-hour plasma glucose during 75 g oral glucose tol - erance test (OGTT) is <140 mg/dL.2.Diagnostic criteria for diabetes 1) Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c; HbA1c should be measured using the standardized method) ≥6.5%, or 2) 8-hour FPG level ≥126 mg/dL, or 3) 2-hour plasma glucose during 75 g OGTT ≥200 mg/dL, or 4) Presence of typical symptoms of diabetes (polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss) with random plasma glucose level ≥200 mg/dL -If an individual meets any of 1)–3) of the diagnostic criteria, tests should be repeated on different days.However, an immediate diag - nosis can be made if the individual meets at least two criteria from the tests simultaneously performed.3.
Diagnostic criteria for prediabetes 1) Impaired fasting glucose (IFG): FPG level 100–125 mg/dL, or 2) Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): 2-hour plasma glucose during 75 g OGTT 140–199 mg/dL, or 3) HbA1c: 5.7%–6.4% Moon JS, et al.550 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgTable 3. Oral glucose tolerance test methods 1 Maintain usual physical activity and consume an unrestricted diet (greater than 150 g of carbohydrate daily) for at least 3 days before the test.2 An overnight fast of 10–14 hours should be preceded for fasting plasma glucose measurement.3 Drink 75 g of glucose in 250–300 mL of water or 150 mL of a commercially available dextrose solution over 5 minutes.4 Blood samples are collected 2 hours after the test load (The time at which drinking began is considered 0 minute).5 If appropriate, samples may also be taken in 30, 60, and 90 minutes.and the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in indi - viduals with IGT, it is worth screening for prediabetes.
There - fore, it is clinically meaningful to diagnose not only diabetes but also IGT through OGTT. Glycosylated hemoglobin The HbA1c test is a widely used, convenient means for deter - mining glycemic status.It is available irrespective of fasting or meals and correlates well with FPG and postprandial blood glucose levels.In 2009, the International Expert Committee recommended that an HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher should be included as a new diagnostic criterion for diabetes when tested by a standardized method (Diabetes Control and Complication Trial [DCCT] reference assay) and certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program.This is because it more accurately reflects long-term glycemic control, correlates well with the risk of diabetic complications, and is more reliable than blood glucose measurement.The ADA [3] and JDS [8] also included this criterion in their diagnostic guidelines.
In Korea, it has been found that using FPG of 126 mg/dL or higher alone as a diagnostic criterion for detecting diabetes could diagnose 55.7% of all diabetic patients, suggesting that the HbA1c criterion should also be considered [12]. The con - cordance of FPG and HbA1c levels as the diagnostic criteria for diabetes detection has been confirmed.Considering the low specificity of FPG and concordance between FPG and HbA1c levels, it is appropriate to use an HbA1c of 6.5% or more as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes in Korea [13].This has been reflected in the guidelines of the KDA since 2013.However, the diagnosis rate of diabetes when using HbA1c alone was only 30% of that when using a combination of FPG and 2-hour plas - ma glucose after OGTT [14].
It is important to pay caution while interpreting the HbA1c results because HbA1c levels do not accurately reflect blood glucose status in certain situations such as hemoglobinopathies, pregnancy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, human immunodeficiency virus in -fection, hemodialysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, and he - matopoietic drug treatment. 1.2 Classification of diabetes With the revisions made by the ADA in 1997 and the WHO in 1999, the terms of insulin-dependent and insulin-independent diabetes based on treatment perspectives have been revised to T1DM and T2DM.There have been no significant changes to the classification of diabetes mellitus since then (Table 4).Based on the findings that the incidence of IGT was common (12% to 40%) in liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis), the recom - mendation by the Committee of the JDS in 2002 added liver disease as one of the causes resulting in ‘other diabetes.
’ As the prevalence of diabetes among individuals with chronic liver disease increased to 15% to 30% in Korea as well [15], liver dis - ease was added as a cause of ‘other diabetes’ also in the KDA guideline since 2011. Measurement of autoantibodies (glutamic acid decarboxyl - ase [GAD] autoantibody, insulin autoantibody, islet autoanti - body, etc.), insulin, and C-peptide may help differentiate be - tween T1DM and T2DM.Several Korean studies have classified fasting serum C-peptide levels below 0.6 ng/mL (0.2 nmol/L) as indicative of T1DM and above 1.0 ng/mL (0.33 nmol/L) as in - dicative of T2DM.The presence of autoantibodies increases the likelihood of immune-mediated T1DM.However, it has been reported that 4% to 25% of individuals diagnosed with T2DM tested positive for GAD autoantibody.In such cases, insulin treatment is more likely to be initiated [16-19].
Among diabetes caused by autoimmune mechanisms, cases that progress slowly, as op - posed to the rapidly progressing T1DM, are separately classi - fied as ‘latent autoimmune diabetes in adults’ [20]. Atypical di - abetes, which is difficult to classify at the time of onset, is rela - tively common in Korea [21].The clinical course, C-peptide, and autoantibodies should be monitored and re-evaluated in this case.2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea551 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgTable 4.Classification of diabetes 1 Type 1 diabetes mellitus: diabetes caused by insulin deficiency due to β-cell destruction 1-1.Immune-mediated 1-2.Idiopathic 2 Type 2 diabetes mellitus: diabetes caused by insulin resistance and progressive insulin secretion defect 3 Gestational diabetes mellitus: diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy 4 Other diabetes 4-1.

The first hospital visit after confirming pregnancy 1) All pregnant women should undergo either fasting plasma glucose (FPG), random plasma glucose, or HbA1c testing at their first hospital visit after confirming pregnancy. [Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2) If pregnant women meet any of the following criteria during the first hospital visit after confirming pregnant, they are considered to have pre-existing diabetes—If an individualmeets any of the 2-1) to 2-3) criteria, diagonosis requires two abnormal test results ob - tained at the same time or these criteria should be confirmed by releat testing on a different day.2-1) HbA1c ≥6.5% 2-2) 8-hour FPG≥126 mg/dL 2-3) 2-hour plasma glucose during 75-g OGTT ≥200 mg/dL 2-4) Presence of classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, and unknown weight loss) with random plasma glucose level ≥200 mg/dL 2.
24 to 28 weeks of gestation 1) Pregnant women who have never been diagnosed with diabetes or gestational diabetes should be tested using one of the following methods between 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. [Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 1-1) 75-g OGTT: gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is diagnesd if one or more of the following criteria are met (one-step approach).- FPG ≥92 mg/dL - 1-hour plasma glucose during OGTT ≥180 mg/dL - 2-hour plasma glucose during OGTT ≥153 mg/dL 1-2) If the plasma glucose level measured 1 hour after loadduring a 50-g OGTT is ≥140 mg/dL (≥130 mg/dL for pregnant women at high risk), proceed to a 100-g OGTT; GDM is diagnosed if two or more of the following criteria are met (two-step approach).
- FPG ≥95 mg/dL - 1-hour plasma glucose during OGTT ≥180 mg/dL - 2-hour plasma glucose during OGTT ≥155 mg/dL - 3-hour plasma glucose during OGTT ≥140 mg/dL Level of evidence Early diagnosis of glycemic abnormalities during pregnancy is crucial as hyperglycemia during pregnancy can lead to fetal malformations, death, and increased complications at birth [22-24]. Benefits Early detection of diabetes in pregnant women is critical for minimizing obstetric risks by reducing the fetal exposure to high blood glucose levels during organ development.Risks It remains uncertain whether it is appropriate to use the same diagnostic criteria for diabetes in the general population for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes [25].
Screening all preg - nant women without assessing their diabetes risk could result in unnecessary tests.Recommendation 2.1 The first hospital visit after confirming pregnancy 1) All pregnant women should undergo either FPG, random plasma glucose, or HbA1c testing at their first hospital visit after confirming pregnancy. [Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2) If pregnant women meet any of the following criteria during the first hospital visit after confirming pregnant, they are considered to have pre-existing diabetes—If an individualmeets any of the 2-1) to 2-3) criteria, diagonosis requires two abnormal test results obtained at the same time or these criteria should be confirmed by releat testing on a different day.
2-1) HbA1c ≥6.5% 2-2) 8-hour FPG ≥126 mg/dL 2-3) 2-hour plasma glucose during 75-g OGTT ≥200 mg/dL 2-4) Presence of classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, and unknown weight loss) with random plasma glucose level ≥200 mg/dL 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea553 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgBalancing the benefits and risks Considering the impact of high blood glucose on the fetus in early pregnancy, the benefits of testing outweigh the risks. Alternatives and considerations Women planning pregnancy should be considered for screen - ing for diabetes in advance, as diagnosing and treating diabetes early can reduce the risk of obstetric complications [26,27].Level of evidence The 50-g OGTT, utilized in the two-step screening strategy, does not require fasting and effectively screens for GDM.Set - ting the 1-hour plasma glucose threshold at 140 mg/dL identi - fies approximately 80% of GDM cases.
Lowering this threshold to 130 mg/dL enhances the detection rate to 90% [28]. In a study of 2,776 Korean women, the application of the Carpenter-Cous - tan criteria within the two-step approach significantly increased the frequency of obstetric complications and macrosomic in - fants compared to the National Diabetes Data Group criteria within the same approach [29].The KDA adopted the two-step approach using the Carpenter-Coustant criteria, following the recommendations of the ADA.However, the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study demonstrat - ed that increased glycemia during pregnancy is associated with a sequential increase in the frequency of obstetric complications [30].
Based on these findings, the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) has set the cutoff for the one-step approach at a blood glucose level that corresponds to a 1.75-fold increase in the odds ratio (OR) of complications relative to the general pregnant population [31]. This one-step approach has been shown to double the diagnosis rate of gestational diabetes when compared to the two-step ap - proach [32].Benefits Both protocols can efficiently diagnose gestational diabetes, prevent obstetric complications caused by hyperglycemia, and serve as evidence for advocating routine diabetes screening, as women are at risk for diabetes after giving birth.Risks The OGTT may induce nausea and/or vomiting in some indi - viduals and can lead to hypoglycemia in individuals who have undergone gastrointestinal (GI) bypass surgery.
Balancing the benefits and risks Considering the impact of hyperglycemia during pregnancy on both the mother and fetus, the advantages of screening sur - pass the associated risks. However, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the one-step to the two-step approach revealed no significant differences in the risk of maternal or perinatal complications, despite the former identifying twice as many gestational diabetes cases [33].Additionally, using a less stringent cutoff of 99 mg/dL for fasting glucose or 162 mg/ dL for 2-hour postprandial glucose in the two-step method, as opposed to the 92–180–153 mg/dL criteria of the one-step ap - proach, resulted in diagnosing less than half the number of gestational diabetes cases, with no variation in the risk of large for gestational age (LGA) births [34].
This indicates that the increased diagnosis rate of gestational diabetes through the one-step approach may lead to unnecessary healthcare de - mands, suggesting the need for further investigation. Alternatives and considerations It should be considered that the one-step approach, according to HAPO study results, better predicts direct complications re - lated to pregnancy, while the two-step approach is based on the incidence of future diabetes.Recommendation 2.2 24 to 28 weeks of gestation 1) Pregnant women who have never been diagnosed with diabetes or gestational diabetes should be tested using one of the follow - ing methods between 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy.[Non-ran - domized controlled trial, general recommendation] 1-1) 75-g OGTT: GDM is diagnesd if one or more of the fol - lowing criteria are met (one-step approach).
- FPG ≥92 mg/dL - 1-hour plasma glucose during OGTT ≥180 mg/dL - 2-hour plasma glucose during OGTT ≥153 mg/dL 1-2) If the plasma glucose level measured 1 hour after loaddur - ing a 50 g OGTT is ≥140 mg/dL (≥130 mg/dL for preg - nant women at high risk), proceed to a 100-g OGTT; GDM is diagnesd if two or more of the following criteria are met (two-step approach). - FPG ≥95 mg/dL - 1-hour plasma glucose during OGTT ≥180 mg/dL - 2-hour plasma glucose during OGTT ≥155 mg/dL - 3-hour plasma glucose during OGTT ≥140 mg/dL Moon JS, et al.554 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.org3.SCREENING FOR DIABETES 1.Screening for diabetes based on FPG, HbA1c, or 2-hour plasma glucose 75-g OGTT is assessed.[Non-randomized controlled trial, gener - al recommendation] 2.Annual screening for diabetes [Expert opinion, general recommendation] should be considered for adults aged ≥35 and adults aged ≥19 who have one or more risk factors (Table 5).[Uncontrolled studies, general recommendation] 3.

Risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus Overweight or obese (body mass index ≥23 kg/m2) Abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥90 cm for men, ≥85 cm for women) Family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus in first degree relative (parents, siblings) History of prediabetes History of gestational diabetes mellitus or delivery of a macrosomia baby (≥4 kg) Hypertension (≥140/90 mm Hg or on theray for hypertension) High-density lipoprotein cholesterol level ≤35 mg/dL or triglyceride level ≥250 mg/dL Condidtions associated with Insulin resistance (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome, acanthocytosis nigricans) History of cardiovascular disease (e.g., stroke, coronary artery disease) Medications (e.g., glucocorticoids, atypical antipsychotics) Backgrounds The goal of screening for diabetes is to identify individuals at high risk for developing diabetes and to detect diabetes at the early stage.
T2DM frequently remains undiagnosed until com - plications occur, as it often presents without specific symptoms. It is estimated that approximately one-third of the induviduals with this condition are unaware of their diabetes condition.Therefore, it is crucial to implement diabetes screening to iden - tify diabetes or prediabetes in high-risk populations.Criteria defining high-risk groups vary slightly between countries The risk factors for T2DM in Koreans are shown in Table 5.In recent years, obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes have become more prevalent among young adults under the age of 40 [35,36].This necessitated an update to the diabetes screening guidelines, previously focused on adults aged 40 and above or those aged 30 and above with additional risk factors.Consequently, the ADA revised its guidelines in 2022 [37] to start diabetes screening from the age of 35 instead of 45.
The Clinical Practice Guideline Committee of the KDA conducted a cross-sectional study to es - tablish the appropriate age for initiating diabetes screening in adults. This study utilized data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) for the years 2016 to 2020 and the National Health Insurance Service Nation - al Sample Cohort for 2012 to 2017 [38].Upon evaulating the number needed to screen (NNS) to identify one individual with diabetes, a significant difference in NNS by age group was ob - served, starting from the 35 to 39 age group (Fig.1).Additional - ly, an evaluation of the NNS for diabetes based on risk factors for T2DM in adults aged 20 to 34, using data from the KNHANES (2016 to 2020), revealed that the lowest NNS was 17 (with hy - pertension), while the highest was 48 (with being overweight).
Notably, the NNS for abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥90 cm for men, ≥85 cm for women) was 23, which is lower than the NNS of 34 for general obesity. Based on these findings, 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea555 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgKDA recommends diabetes screening for adults aged 35 and older, as well as for adults aged 20 and older with risk factors for T2DM.The revised age threshold substantially reduced the per - centage of individuals with undiagnosed diabetes missed by screening, from 4.0% to 0.2%, without significantly increasing the NNS compared to the criteria set by the current guidelines.
The KDA also considered the recent trend of the steadily in - creasing prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in Korean chil - dren and adolescents [39] and the recommendation that screen - ing for diabetes in children and adolescents should be consid - ered at the age of 10 years or after the onset of puberty if risk fac - tors are present. The Committee of Clinical Practice Guideline of KDA thus decided to recommend screening for diabetes in all adults aged 35 years or older and all adults aged 19 years or older with risk factors.Additionally, abdominal obesity has been add - ed as a criterion for the risk factors of T2DM.Testing for HbA1c, regardless of fasting status, is an effective approach for assessing glycemic control.However, it was ini - tially excluded from diabetes diagnosis and screening protocols due to concerns over standardization and the accuracy of mea - surement techniques.
With advancements in the accuracy and standardization of HbA1c testing methods, an International Expert Committee endorsed the utilization of the HbA1c test as a method for diabetes screening in 2009 [40-42]. In 2010, the ADA guidelines were updated to include “HbA1c ≥6.5%” as part of the diagnostic criteria for diabetes and “HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4%” to identify individuals at high risk for diabetes.Concur - rently, in Korea, significant research has been published regard - ing the diagnostic utility of HbA1c [12,43].In 2009, the Diag - nostic Subcommittee of the KDA undertook a study across eight hospitals, measuring FPG, 2-hour plasma glucose, and HbA1c levels in over 1,000 individuals with no previous diabe - tes diagnosis.The established HbA1c cutoff points for diagnos - ing diabetes and IGT are 6.1% and 5.7%, respectively [44].
Therefore, adults presenting with an HbA1c level of 6.1% or higher are categorized as having a very high risk for developing diabetes and are recommended to undergo an OGTT. Analyz - ing fasting and post-glucose load blood glucose levels, data from four extensive Korean cohort studies—comprising 2,473 subjects from Y eoncheon, 1,106 from Jeongeup, 774 from Mok - dong, and 1,881 from Ansan, totaling 6,234 subjects between 1993 and 2000—revealed that classifying IFG into two distinct stages improves diabetes diagnosis rates.For individuals with stage 1 IFG, characterized by FPG levels between 100 and 109 mg/dL, annual screening is advised.If risk factors are present, an OGTT is recommended.For those identified with stage 2 IFG, where FPG levels range from 110 to 125 mg/dL, an imme - diate OGTT is recommended [2].
According to the recently published Korean Diabetes Preven - tion Study (KDPS), among 446 individuals newly diagnosed with diabetes and having a BMI of 23 kg/m2 or above, 76.2% FPG levels under 126 mg/dL. A 59.2% exceeded the criteria only Fig.1.Number of people who should be screened for diabetes by age group [38].NNS, number need to screen; NHIS-NSC, Na - tional Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort; KNHANES, Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.200 100 0 20–24 25–29 30–34 35–39 40–44 45–49 50–54 55–59 60–64 65–69 70–74 ≥75 Age group (yr) NHIS-NSC KNHANESNNS Moon JS, et al.556 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgwith their 2-hour post-glucose load plasma glucose levels, while their FPG and HbA1c levels were below the threshold.
When categorizing FPG levels as <100 mg/dL (normal), 100–109 mg/ dL (stage 1 IFG), and 110–125 mg/dL (stage 2 IFG), the percent - ages of subjects with a 2-hour plasma glucose level of ≥200 mg/ dL were found to be 9.5%, 19.0%, and 43.5%, respectively [45]. The JDS guidelines [46] recommend considering an OGTT for individuals with FPG levels at or above 100 mg/dL, or an HbA1c at or above 5.6%.Similarly, the Canadian Diabetes Association [47] advises an OGTT for individuals with FPG levels at or above 100 mg/dL and one or more risk factors.Based on these Korean and international studies, it is recommended for adults with a BMI of 23 kg/m2 or higher to consider an annual mea - surement of FPG or HbA1c along with an OGTT if FPG levels are 100 to 109 mg/dL or HbA1c is 5.7% to 6.0%, and to undergo an OGTT if FPG levels are 110 to 125 mg/dL or HbA1c is 6.1% to 6.4%.The 40% to 50% of women diagnosed with gestational diabetes are at risk of developing T2DM over time [48,49].
Therefore, these individuals are considered high risk for the on - set of diabetes and should implement necessary lifestyle modifi - cations for prevention. Women with a history of gestational dia - betes are advised to undergo a 75-g OGTT between 4 to 12 weeks postpartum.If the results are normal, annual screening for diabetes is recommended.A study in Korea has introduced a self-scoring system de - signed to evaluate the risk of diabetes.This method involves as - signing scores to various risk factors, including smoking, age, abdominal obesity, family history of diabetes, alcohol intake, and high blood pressure, to estimate the probability of having undiagnosed [50].A self-scoring method has been developed to estimate the percentage likelihood of developing diabetes within the next 10 years, utilizing data from 8,740 adults without diabetes.
These participants were involved in the Anseong-Ansan co - hort study, a long-term epidemiological research project in Korea, where they were subjected to 75-g OGTT and HbA1c tests at 2-year intervals. The estimation method could be ref - ered in [51].Blood sample for screening test The principle for diagnosing diabetes is to use plasma collected from venous blood.Glucose concentrations vary according to the type of blood collected, that is, venous, arterial, or capillary blood, and can change based on fasting status and meal times.Generally, arterial blood has the highest glucose concentration, followed by capillary and then venous blood.The difference in glucose levels between arterial and venous blood in the morn - ing while fasting is approximately 10 mg/dL, but this gap can widen to 20 to 50 mg/dL after meals.Additionally, glucose lev - els vary depending on the type of specimen collected: whole blood, plasma, or serum.
Plasma glucose concentrations are generally 10% to 15% higher than those in whole blood. It’s also noteworthy that red blood cells, which contain glycolytic en - zymes, can decrease blood glucose levels by about 10 mg/dL per hour.Therefore, if testing with serum is unavoidable, the serum should be separated within 30 minutes of blood collec - tion, and blood collection tubes containing sodium fluoride (NaF) should be used to inhibit this action [52,53].Especially in mass screenings where a large number of samples are ana - lyzed simultaneously, serum is often used, so careful manage - ment of the samples is necessary.2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea557 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgLevel of evidence Recommendation for lifestyle modification education to pre - vent the development of T2DM in adults with prediabetes was based on the results of 11 RCTs on lifestyle interventions [54- 64].
The evidence for the long-term effects of the lifestyle inter - ventions was based on studies that identified differences in dia - betes or diabetes complication development upon longer fol - low-up in participants of T2DM prevention studies [65-73]. The evidence for the effectiveness of ICT-based interventions in preventing the development of T2DM was based on the re - sults of five RCTs [74-78].All of these study participants were people with prediabetes, but there were differences in the criteria, such as IGT, IFG, overweight, and obesity across each study.The lifestyle inter - ventions used in the studies varied in terms of the expertise of the educators (physicians, nurses, dietitians, etc.), the intensity of the intervention, the number of visits, and the duration of the intervention.However, all included dietary, exercise, and behavioral interventions.Studies also differed in the number of participants and diagnostic methods for defining the devel -4.

Long-term prognostic observational studies after the end of the intervention have a lower level of evidence than randomized trials. Still, these stud - ies have reported important implications of the long-term ef - fects of interventions and, therefore, were reflected in the rec - ommendations.Benefits Although the studies varied in terms of participants character - istics, methods, duration, intensity of the lifestyle interven - tions, and methods of diagnosing diabetes, systematic inter - ventions to modify lifestyle behaviors significantly reduced the incidence of T2DM in adults with prediabetes.In the referenc - es used to develop this guideline, the risk of developing diabe - Moon JS, et al.558 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgtes after lifestyle interventions was reduced by 28.5% to 68% compared to the control group.
Most of the lifestyle interven - tions used in the studies included a comprehensive diet, exer - cise, and behavioral therapy; one study compared the effects of the interventions by dividing them into three groups: diet alone, exercise alone, and diet and exercise combined. This study reported no differences in diabetes prevention among the three groups [54].After the end of diabetes prevention studies, studies regard - ing long-term outcomes of interventions, with 10 to 30 years of follow-up in selected participants, have been published.In these studies, participants were encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle through various methods after the end of the intervention study and by observing the course.The risks of developing T2DM, diabetes-related complications, and mor - tality were reduced in the lifestyle intervention group [65- 73,79,80].
However, the difference in the effect of diabetes pre - vention compared with the control group decreased with lon - ger follow-up, therefore, continued motivation and monitoring using various methods to maintain lifestyle modification are required. The effect of lifestyle interventions using ICT-based inter - ventions, such as Internet-based programs, voice or text mes - sages, or smartphone applications, in preventing the develop - ment of T2DM was unclear.In the literature used for evidence, no consistent results were found when comparing intervention and control groups on key endpoints such as weight, HbA1c, and risk of diabetes development.Some studies using Internet or mobile-based educational programs as adjunct means have shown significant improvements in key clinical indicators such as body weight and BMI over a certain period [77,78].In the future, it is necessary to develop a systematic method to main - tain the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions utilizing ICTs.
Risks No serious adverse events related to the conduct of the re - search or the interventions occurred in the studies used to de - velop the recommendations. Balancing the benefits and risks The results of the reference studies of this recommendation show that in adults with prediabetes, the benefits of lifestyle in - terventions to prevent the development of T2DM are substan - tial, and the potential risks are low.The long-term effects of di - abetes prevention using ICT-based means are unclear, and the potential risks are not high.Alternatives and considerations Lifestyle interventions for preventing T2DM should be tailored to the specific characteristics and environment of different countries and ethnic groups.This means that directly applying lifestyle interventions from studies cited in current guidelines may not be suitable for the Korean population.
The KDPS was initiated as a national project by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea in collaboration with the National Evi - dence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It aims to develop diabetes prevention strategies suitable for the Korean context and assess their effectiveness in preventing T2DM among Ko - rean adults with prediabetes.The KDPS is a RCT co-developed by the KDA and conducted by 15 medical institutions from 2016 to 2023 [81].Eight hundred and forty-four overweight or obese adults with prediabetes (30 to 70 years old) were enrolled and randomized to three different groups: the lifestyle inter - vention group, the metformin group, and the standard care group (control group).
The hospital-based lifestyle modifica - tion (KDPS-hLSM), used in the KDPS, is the first multidisci - plinary lifestyle intervention for diabetes prevention in Korea, and a recent interim analysis of the 6-month intervention re - ported positive effects on body weight and metabolic markers in the lifestyle intervention group compared to the control group (paper yet to be published). Although the diabetes pre - vention effect has yet to be confirmed, the KDPS-hLSM, which has been applied for more than 3 years, has not reported any risks but has shown a tendency for a beneficial effect.There - fore, it can be considered for application as a lifestyle interven - tion method for adults with prediabetes in Korea.Meanwhile, a large-scale and long-term study on the effectiveness of ICT- based diabetes prevention interventions that can be utilized in various settings is required.
Recommendation 4.3 For diabetes prevention, adults with predia - betes should follow individualized diet plans, considering each person’s eating patterns. [Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 4.4 Adults with prediabetes should engage in at least moderate-intensity physical activity for ≥150 minutes per week to prevent diabetes.[Randomized controlled trial, general rec - ommendation] Recommendation 4.5 Overweight or obese adults with prediabe - tes should achieve and maintain a weight reduction of at least 5% of 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea559 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgLevel of evidence The 11 RCTs [54-64] on lifestyle interventions on which the recommendations were based all included adults with predia - betes who were overweight/obese (BMI ≥23 kg/m2), and five of the trials [54,56,58,63] also included participants with BMI lower than 23 kg/m2.
All studies were systematically designed and conducted and had a high level of evidence. Due to the na - ture of the studies, complete blinding of the intervention and control groups was not feasible.The detailed selection criteria, number of participants, and duration of the intervention var - ied by study.In particular, the lifestyle interventions utilized in the studies varied regarding educators, intervention intensity, number of visits, and duration, but all included a systematic diet and exercise regimen.Benefits In adults with prediabetes, individualized systematic dietary interventions, including individual characteristics and eating patterns, significantly reduced the incidence of diabetes.Physi - cal activity of 150 minutes or more per week of at least moder - ate-intensity also significantly reduced the incidence of diabe - tes in adults with prediabetes.
The systematic lifestyle interven - tions used in most studies were developed to include diet and exercise, demonstrating their efficacy in diabetes prevention. One study compared the effects of three interventions: diet alone, exercise alone, and a combination of diet and exercise; all three groups showed similar diabetes prevention effects [54].In overweight/obese adults with prediabetes, weight loss was an important factor for diabetes prevention.Achieving and maintaining a weight reduction of at least 5% significantly reduced the incidence of diabetes.Risks No serious adverse events related to the conduct of the research or the interventions occurred in the studies used to develop the recommendations.Balancing the benefits and risks In adults with prediabetes, the benefits of a systematic lifestyle intervention that includes diet and exercise to prevent the de - velopment of diabetes are substantial, while the potential risks are low.
In overweight/obese adults with prediabetes, the bene - fits of weight loss outweigh the risks; however, the benefits of weight loss in adults with a BMI <23 kg/m2 are not clear. Alternatives and considerations Although the diet and exercise regimens shown to be effective in the reference studies vary in content and methodology, the lack of such research in Koreans limits the application of these interventions to the Korean population.Additionally, all di - etary and exercise regimens should be individualized accord - ing to individual characteristics.The KDPS-hLSM used in the KDPS study is a lifestyle intervention with a standardized edu - cational methodology conducted as an interventional study at 15 medical centers and can be considered for application in overweight/obese adults with prediabetes in Korea.
KDPS- hLSM is a lifestyle intervention based on intensive nutrition therapy by a clinical nutritionist and 10 healthy lifestyle chang - es (10 components: one exercise, five diet, and four behavior) by a health coordinator. It aims to achieve and maintain a weight loss of 5% or more.Similarly, education and interven - tion are individualized according to various individual charac - teristics, eating patterns, and stages of behavior change.How - ever, since the KDPS study is still in progress, it is necessary to secure evidence of its diabetes prevention and long-term effect, as well as to investigate its application in normal-weight sub - jects and various community health organizations.Level of evidence Recommendations on the effectiveness of pharmacologic in - terventions in preventing diabetes in adults with prediabetes are based on 11 RCTs [56,58,82-90].
All of the study partici - pants were people with prediabetes, but each study differed in their inclusion criteria, number of participants, and duration of intervention. The studies used to develop this recommendation were all well-designed, conducted systematically, and had a high level of evidence.However, due to the nature of the stud - ies, complete blinding of the intervention and control groups was not feasible.Studies involving currently unavailable drugs were excluded.Recommendation 4.6 Metformin can be considered to prevent diabetes in overweight or obese adults with prediabetes.[Random - ized controlled trial, limited recommendation]their initial body weight to prevent diabetes.
[Randomized con - trolled trial, limited recommendation] Moon JS, et al.560 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgBenefits Although studies differed in terms of patient characteristics, in - tervention methods, and duration, pharmacologic interven - tions significantly reduced the risk of developing diabetes (Ta - ble 6). Currently, metformin, acarbose, orlistat, pioglitazone, voglibose, liraglutide, phentermine/topiramate extended-re - lease, and valsartan have been reported to prevent the develop - ment of diabetes [56,58,82-90].Particularly, pioglitazone, lira - glutide, and phentermine/topiramate extended-release have been shown to have a preventive effect of over 50% [86-89].However, no studies have compared the superiority of these drugs.Long-term observational studies have confirmed the prevention of the development of diabetes and diabetic compli - cations and reduced mortality in metformin users [73,79,80].
Risks There is a potential risk of developing adverse effects related to the drugs used in the intervention. Adverse effects of metfor - min include lactic acidosis, dyspepsia, and vitamin B12 defi - ciency.Acarbose and voglibose may cause GI disturbances Table 6.Key evidence for diabetes prevention: pharmacologic interventions Study Participants No.

Therefore, further studies are needed to evaluate the ef - fectiveness and safety of various pharmacological interven - tions for the prevention of diabetes in Koreans with prediabe - tes. The ongoing KDPS study includes metformin drug inter - vention in overweight/obese adults with prediabetes (30 to 70 years old), and the results of the 6-month interim analysis showed positive effects on body weight and metabolic markers compared to the control group.However, it is necessary to se - cure evidence of its diabetes prevention and long-term effect regarding metformin interventions [81].Therefore, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations posed by the absence of drugs approved for diabetes prevention in Korea and the necessity for continuous administration, as the preventive effects are lost once the drug is discontinued.Moon JS, et al.562 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.org5.GLYCEMIC GOALS IN ADULTS WITH DIABETES 1.
Actively control blood glucose to prevent microvascular and macrovascular complications. [Randomized controlled trial, general recom - mendation] 2.General glycemic goal in adults with T2DM is HbA1c <6.5%.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 3.General glycemic goal in adults with T1DM is HbA1c <7.0%.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 4.Glycemic goals should be individualized based on the patient’s physical, psychological, and social conditions, life expectancy, the severity of comorbidities, or the risk of hypoglycemia.[Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 5.When using a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device, time in range (TIR) (70 to 180 mg/dL) should be >70% with time below range (TBR) of <4%, especially the time of hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL) which should be <1%.
[Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 5.1 Actively control blood glucose to prevent microvascular and macrovascular complications. [Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Level of evidence Results are based on multiple RCTs and follow-up studies, there - by can be applied to individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes.Benefits Based on the results of several clinical trials showing that tight glycemic control early in the course of diagnosis of diabetes can reduce the risk of microvascular and macrovascular com - plications in adults with diabetes.1) Glycemic control and microvascular complications The DCCT, a RCT, demonstrated whether intensive glycemic control in T1DM prevents diabetic complications [91].Tight glycemic control reduced the development of retinopathy by 76% and slowed the progression rate of retinopathy by 54%.It also reduced the incidence of microalbuminuria by 39%, mac - roalbuminuria by 54%, and neuropathy by 60%.
The Epidemi - ology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study, a follow-up of the DCCT cohort, demonstrated that the benefits of tight glycemic control persisted for over 20 years, even after glycemic control was no longer being maintained. This suggests a lasting benefit, or “legacy effect, ” of tight glyce - mic control in preventing microvascular complications [92,93].The Kumamoto study [94] and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) [95,96] targeting T2DM demonstrated that in -tensive glycemic control was protective against microvascular complications, and the follow-up study of the UKPDS [97,98] showed that the protective effect was sustained over time.The Kumamoto study reported that the group with intensive glycemic control experienced a 69% reduction in retinopathy, a 70% reduction in nephropathy, and an improvement in nerve conduction velocity.
The UKPDS study is divided into two parts: one that examines the effects of intensive glycemic con - trol using sulfonylureas or insulin (UKPDS33) and one that looks at the effects of metformin in overweight individuals (UKPDS34). Over the 10-year study period, tight glycemic control was linked with a 25% reduction in microvascular com - plications in the UKPDS33 substudy, and there was a trend to - ward a reduction in retinopathy in the UKPDS34 substudy.These three studies demonstrate that intensive glycemic control can significantly reduce microvascular complications.The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (AC - CORD) study [99], the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Dis - ease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADV ANCE) study [100], and the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (V ADT) study [101] aimed to determine wheth - er near-normal glycemic control could protect against cardio - vascular events.
These studies showed a protective effect against some microvascular complications. The ACCORD study observed a 15% to 28% reduction in 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea563 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgthe risk of albuminuria and some improvement in neuropathy- related endpoints.However, overall, there was no reduction in microvascular complications with glycemic control.The ADV ANCE study showed a 14% reduction in microvas - cular complications, which was mainly due to a 21% decrease in the risk of diabetic nephropathy development.However, it did not affect the occurrence of retinopathy.On the other hand, the V ADT study did not prevent microvascular compli - cations but had some impact on the development and progres - sion of albuminuria.The ADV ANCE study suggested in order to minimize microvascular complications, the HbA1c level should be less than 6.5% [102].
2) Glycemic control and cardiovascular disease In the DCCT study, which involved individuals with T1DM, major vascular complications were rare due to the enrollment of young age subjects. However, not statistically significant, tight glycemic control reduced the risk of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular events by 41% [91].In the EDIC study, subjects with tight glycemic control had a 57% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, including non-fatal myo - cardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes, after a total of 17 years of follow-up [103].Additionally, the overall mortality was reduced by 33% after 27 years of fol - low-up [104].In the UKPDS study conducted on individuals with T2DM, although statistically non-significant, tight glycemic control reduced the risk of cardiovascular events such as fatal and non- fatal myocardial infarction and sudden death by 16%.
After a decade of monitoring, it was discovered that patients who had achieved tight glycemic control had a significantly lower inci - dence of myocardial infarction (15% in the sulfonylurea/insu - lin group and 33% in the metformin group) and overall mor - tality (13% and 27%, respectively) [97]. Risks Targeting intensive glycemic control inevitably increased the risk of severe hypoglycemia (SH) by 2- to 3-fold in the DCCT study [91], and significantly increased the risk of uncontrolled hypoglycemia, weight gain, and fluid retention in the AC - CORD study [105].It also increased the risk of cardiovascular events and total mortality in the ACCORD study and cohort studies [105,106].An analysis of the V ADT study suggested that tight glycemic control may be beneficial for CVD preven - tion in individuals with less than 15 years of diabetes duration.However, it may be harmful in those with more than 15 years of diabetes duration [107].
The ACCORD study, which at - tempted to achieve less than 6.0 HbA1c, concluded that near- normoglycemic tight glycemic control has some benefit in preventing microvascular complications, but caution should be exercised in determining glycemic targets as tight glycemic control may have risks of weight gain, SH, and death [99]. Balancing the benefits and risks The newer classes of diabetes medications, such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransport - er-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), have been introduced since the 2000s when most RCTs of glycemic control were conducted.Com - pared to older medications, these drugs have a very low risk of causing hypoglycemia.Therefore, it is likely that these newer medications can help achieve more aggressive glycemic control, and efforts aimed at preventing diabetic complications through glycemic control will result in more benefits than harm.
Level of evidence These findings are based on multiple RCTs and follow-up stud - ies; therefore, they should be applied to all adults with newly diagnosed diabetes. Benefits In the Kumamoto study, the intensive glycemic control group had set the fasting blood glucose target of less than 140 mg/dL, a 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose of less than 200 mg/dL, and HbA1c of less than 7.0%.However, the actual HbA1c level achieved by the tight control group was 7.1%.The authors sug - gested that keeping HbA1c levels below 6.5% could help pre - vent the development and progression of microvascular com - plications.In the UKPDS, intensive glycemic control, which was defined as having a fasting blood glucose level less than 108 mg/dL, it achieved HbA1c levels of 7.0% and 7.4% in the sulfonylurea/in - sulin (UKPDS33) study and the metformin (UKPDS34) study, respectively (compared to 7.9% and 8.0% in the control groups, respectively).
Intensively Maintaining the HbA1c level of 7.0% or less has been shown to significantly reduce microvascular Recommendation 5.2 General glycemic goal in adults with T2DM is HbA1c <6.5%. [Randomized controlled trial, general recommen - dation] Moon JS, et al.564 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgevents compared to conventionally maintaining a control level of 8.0% to 9.0%.The UKPDS observational study also showed a no-threshold association between glycemic control and micro - vascular events [98].A 1.0% reduction in HbA1c was associat - ed with a 37% reduction in microvascular events, with the low - est microvascular events in HbA1c below 6.0%.In other clinical studies consisting of individuals with nearly 10 years of diabetes duration, the achieved HbA1c levels were 6.4% (7.5% control) in the ACCORD study, 6.5% (7.3% con - trol) in the ADV ANCE study, and 6.9% (8.4% control) in the V ADT study.
In the ADV ANCE study, it was analyzed that controlling HbA1c at less than 6.5% can help minimize micro - vascular complications [102]. These studies suggest that main - taining HbA1c 6.5% can protect both newly diagnosed T2DM and individuals who have had diabetes for 10 years against mi - crovascular complications.The Diabetes and Aging Study is an observational study based on data from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) diabetes registry in the United States.According to the study, people who had maintained an HbA1c level below 6.5% in the first year of diagnosis had a lower risk of microvascular complications.Specifically, those with an HbA1c level of 6.5% to 6.9% had a 20% increased risk, while those with an HbA1c level of 7.0% to 7.9% had a 39% increased risk.The risk of com - plications further increased when compared to those who con - trolled the HbA1c level below 6.5 for 2 years.A similar associa - tion was seen for macrovascular complications.
Therefore, it is beneficial to begin targeting HbA1c levels below 6.5% at the time of diagnosis to prevent complications [108]. Risks Tight glycemic control may increase the risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain.The ACCORD study terminated early due to a 1.22-fold increased risk of death (1.41% vs.1.14% per year) in the intensive glycemic control group in comparison to the control group [105].However, no effect on cardiovascular events was observed in the ADV ANCE-ON study, which followed up on ADV ANCE participants for 6 years [109].A 10-year follow-up of V ADT participants showed a 17% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events (8.6 fewer events per 1,000 person-years), but it did not show any difference in the risk of death [110].Balancing the benefits and risks It is important to balance the benefits of tight glycemic control with the risks of hypoglycemia.
DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 in -hibitors, and GLP-1RAs are associated with a shallow risk of hypoglycemia and may be used to minimize the risk of hypo - glycemia while attempting aggressive glycemic control. The Vildagliptin Efficacy in combination with metfoRmIn For earlY treatment of type 2 diabetes (VERIFY) study was a randomized, controlled trial comparing metformin alone to a combination of metformin and vildagliptin in individuals with T2DM [111].Early combination therapy is significantly more effective in controlling glycemia for up to 5 years without risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain, compared to using only metformin.The study showed that 39.3% of patients in the early combination arm had HbA1c levels below 6.5%, while only 27.3% of people in the metformin monotherapy arm.
Ad - ditionally, the time to treatment failure, defined as HbA1c of 7.0% or higher, was 61.9 months in the early combination arm, which is significantly longer than the 36.1 months in the met - formin monotherapy one. The incidence of hypoglycemia was also very mild.Although early combination therapy success - fully reduces glycemic control failures and achieves glycemic control goals for a more extended period, the VERIFY study does not provide evidence that HbA1c levels lower than 6.5% are necessary.Further research is needed to determine whether early combination therapy can reduce complications.Alternatives and considerations T2DM progresses over time.As the disease advances, the pan - creas produces less insulin, making it harder to control optimal blood glucose levels.Therefore, although the target HbA1c level at the time of diagnosis is below 6.5%, it is essential to ad - just the glycemic control goal according to the patient’s condi - tion as the disease progresses.
Blood glucose (self-glycemic testing) is used to assess glyce - mic control, but HbA1c level should be the ultimate standard of glycemic control. To ensure proper control of blood glucose lev - el, it is recommended to control blood glucose to 80 to 130 mg/ dL before meals and less than 180 mg/dL after meals through self-checking or CGM.It is also advised to take the HbA1c test at least every 3 months to assess glycemic control.Level of evidence These results are based on large RCTs and follow-up studies and Recommendation 5.3 General glycemic goal in adults with T1DM is HbA1c <7.0%.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommen - dation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea565 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgshould be applied to all adults with newly diagnosed T1DM.Benefits The DCCT study was conducted between 1983 and 1989, with 1,441 individuals with T1DM enrolled.
The mean age of the participants was 27 years, with 2.6- and 8.6-year diabetes dura - tion in the primary and secondary study, respectively. The con - trol group received one to two insulin injections daily to allevi - ate hyperglycemia symptoms and facilitate normal growth.The intensive glycemic control group was administered with insu - lin injections at least three times a day to achieve pre-prandial blood glucose levels between 70 and 120 mg/dL and postpran - dial blood glucose levels below 180 mg/dL, and HbA1c levels of less than 6.5%, measured monthly.At the start of the study, HbA1c levels ranged from 8.8% to 9.0%.After an average fol - low-up period of 6.5 years, HbA1c levels were to be 9.0% in the control arm and 7.2% in the tight glycemic control one.There - fore, the ideal glycemic control goal for people with T1DM should be less than 7.0% HbA1c.Risks In the DCCT study, tight glycemic control inevitably increased the risk of SH by two to three times [91].
Balancing the benefits and risks The recent use of long-acting and (ultra-) short-acting insulin analogs, which effectively reduced the risk of hypoglycemia, especially severe or nocturnal hypoglycemia, has created a fa - vorable environment for glycemic control. Furthermore, the use of CGM and insulin pumps have significantly improved glycemic control.Alternatives and considerations To achieve the glycemic control goal of having HbA1c levels less than 7.0% in individuals with T1DM, active self-manage - ment education is essential.In response, the government, in collaboration with medical institutions, launched the ‘Home healthcare pilot project for type 1 diabetics’ in January 2020.A medical service system provided by a home healthcare team is anticipated to assist individuals with T1DM in managing their blood glucose levels.
The system will offer educational counsel - ing to help them manage their blood glucose levels and pro - vide continuous monitoring and feedback.Level of evidence It is based on RCTs or multiple observational studies and should be applied to all individuals with advanced diabetes. Benefits Active glycemic control is crucial in preventing microvascular and macrovascular complications.The ideal glycemic control goal for people with T2DM is less than 6.5% HbA1c.It is im - portant to implement more aggressive glycemic control with hypoglycemic agents that pose a low risk of hypoglycemia, par - ticularly in the early stages of diabetes and when the risk of car - diovascular events is not significant.Active glycemic control using hypoglycemic agents with a low risk of hypoglycemia can be very helpful in preventing complications.
Risk Glycemic control goals should be personalized based on the person’s condition and objectives, and subjects should be sys - tematically educated on controlling their blood glucose levels actively. However, individuals with long-standing diabetes, SH or advanced microvascular and macrovascular complications, short life expectancy, or elderly patients may not benefit from aggressive glycemic control to prevent complications.In fact, they may be at greater risk for adverse events such as hypogly - cemia, weight gain, and death; thereby, the glycemic control goal may need to be adjusted upward.Balancing the benefits and risks T2DM is a disease that worsens over time.The pancreas pro - duces less insulin as the disease progresses, and insulin resis - tance can worsen with age.As blood glucose control becomes more challenging, even with combination therapy using various medications, including insulin, achieving optimal blood glu - cose control becomes more challenging.
In addition, glycemic variability increases, making it harder for people with diabetes to manage their own blood glucose levels. As diabetic kidney disease progresses and kidney function decreases, available medications become limited.Severe hypoglycemia can increase the risk of brain damage, dementia, cardiac arrhythmias, and sudden death.Recommendation 5.4 Glycemic goals should be individualized based on the patient’s physical, psychological, and social conditions, life expectancy, the severity of comorbidities, or the risk of hypogly - cemia.[Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.566 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgThe patient’s understanding of diabetes is also essential for treatment.Active glycemic control can be challenging depend - ing on socioeconomic status, education level, and living condi - tions.Many lifestyle modifications such as diet and physical activity may be complex.
Ongoing counseling and consultation can help determine the extent to which a person can make life - style changes to control their blood glucose. Alternatives and considerations In conditions where glycemic control is difficult to achieve, and any improvement effects are unlikely to be seen, it is necessary to set the glycemic goal higher to minimize adverse effects and prioritize the individual’s quality of life.It is also necessary to understand the characteristics of the elderly and refer to geriat - ric medicine guidelines.Real-time CGM (rtCGM) is recommended for all adults with T1DM to control blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.Adults with T2DM using multiple insulin injec - tions can also benefit from rtCGM for glucose control.How - ever, those who use other types of insulin therapy besides mul - tiple insulin injections or those who only use oral hypoglyce - mic medications may also benefit from rtCGM for glycemic control.
According to a study based on data from 545 people with T1DM adopting CGM, CGM data shows a 70% TIR with 70 to 180 mg/dL yields to 7% HbA1c, whereas a 50% TIR corresponds to 8% HbA1c [112]. A 10% change in TIR with 70 to 180 mg/dL (2.4 hours of the day) was associated with a 0.6% change in HbA1c.Therefore, if physicians aim for 6.5% HbA1c, a continu - ous glucose monitor should indicate an 80% time in the target range.For more information, see section ‘Continuous glucose mon - itoring and insulin pumps.’Recommendation 5.5 When using a CGM device, TIR (70 to 180 mg/dL) should be >70% with TBR of <4%, especially the time of hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL) which should be <1%.[Non-random - ized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea567 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.org6.MONITORING AND EV ALUATION OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL 1.Measurement of HbA1c 1) Test HbA1c every 2 to 3 months.
The test interval can be adjusted based on individual conditions, but the test should be conducted at least twice a year. [Expert opinion, general recommendation] 2) Test HbA1c levels more frequently when glycemic fluctuations are severe, when medications are changed, and when tight glycemic control is needed (e.g., in pregnancy).[Uncontrolled studies, general recommendation] 2.Self-monitoring of blood glucose 1) Educate individuals on self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), and check methods and accuracy frequently.[Expert opinion, gen - eral recommendation] 2) Individuals with T1DM or adults with T2DM who are on insulin therapy should perform SMBG.[Randomized controlled trial, gener - al recommendation] 3) Adults with T2DM who are not on insulin therapy should consider SMBG.
[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 4) SMBG can be done before and after the meal, before bedtime, at dawn, before and after exercise, and in the event of hypoglycemia, and the time and frequency of measurements can be individualized based on the patient’s condition. [Expert opinion, general recom - mendation] 3.Continuous glucose monitoring 1) A rtCGM device is recommended to control blood glucose and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in adults with T1DM.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2) A rtCGM device should be considered to control blood glucose in individuals with T2DM on insulin therapy.[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] Recommendation 6.1-1) Test HbA1c every 2 to 3 months.The test interval can be adjusted based on individual conditions, but the test should be conducted at least twice a year.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Level of evidence Due to the lack of large RCTs, most recommendations are based on expert consensus.
Benefits Two large RCTs of T1DM and T2DM, DCCT and UKPDS, showed that glycemic control, as measured by the HbA1c level, was strongly associated with diabetes complications [98,113]. HbA1c is a measure of the degree of glycation of hemoglobin in response to levels of blood glucose, which reflects the aver - age blood glucose over the lifetime of a red blood cell (about 3 months).It determines whether an individual’s blood glucose has reached or is being maintained at the desired level and is usually measured every 2 to 3 months.However, it may be test - ed more frequently in case of significant fluctuations in blood glucose, medication changes, or when closer control is needed, such as during pregnancy, depending on the patient’s clinical situation and treatment [114].Although HbA1c is arguably the most crucial indicator of glycemic control, the exact number of measurements required is yet to be determined due to insuffi - cient evidence.
Risks Frequent HbA1c measurements can help manage blood glu - cose levels and adjust lifestyle modification [115,116], but are costly and require constant blood collection. Balancing the benefits and risks There is currently no other marker that can replace HbA1c, so its benefits outweigh its risks.Alternatives and considerations In cases where there is anemia, such as hemoglobinopathies, hemoglobin metabolism disorders, and hemolytic anemia, as well as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, blood transfusions, increased erythropoiesis, end-stage renal disease Moon JS, et al.568 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.org(ESRD), pregnancy, or any other situation where the turnover rates of red blood cells increase, the results of HbA1c may not be completely reliable and should be interpreted with caution.In such cases, it is advisable to test more frequently or use alter - native methods such as a SMBG, CGM, fructosamine, or gly - cated albumin [117].
As a short-term blood glucose monitoring method, the use of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-anhydrogl, 1,5- AG) is also possible, but there is not enough research to deter - mine how it correlates with average blood sugar or how it re - lates to prognosis in diabetes patients. HbA1c is not a reliable indicator of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia in individuals with T1DM experiencing signifi - cant fluctuations in blood glucose, in individuals with T2DM with severe insulin deficiency, or individuals requiring multiple insulin injections [118].Therefore, in such cases, HbA1c should be used in combination with SMBG levels or CGM to evaluate glycemic control.On the other hand, HbA1c is helpful in deter - mining the accuracy of self-glycemic testing or CGM devices, as well as the suitability of testing frequency and duration.An international consensus on TIR published in 2019 recommends using TIR, one of the CGM metrics, as an alternative to HbA1c [119].
Level of evidence Due to a lack of large randomized or non-randomized controlled studies, the level of evidence is based on other research. Benefits HbA1c levels are usually measured at intervals of 2 to 3 months.However, considering the patient’s clinical situation, treatment, and other factors, more frequent HbA1c measurements may be required.This is particularly true when glycemic fluctuations are severe, medications are changed, or more stringent control is needed, such as during pregnancy [114].Risks Frequent HbA1c measurements can help manage blood glu - cose levels and adjust lifestyle modification, but are costly and require constant blood collection.Balancing the benefits and risks There is currently no other marker that can replace HbA1c in assessing glycemic control, so its benefits outweigh its risks.Alternatives and considerations As mentioned above, alternatives include SMBG, TIR of CGM, fructosamine, glycated albumin, and 1,5-AG.
However, there is not enough evidence to substitute HbA1c with other alterna - tives. Level of evidence Due to the lack of large RCTs, the recommendations provided are based on the opinion of experts.Benefits SMBG is a useful method for managing diabetes, as it allows people with diabetes to monitor the response to treatment and ensure whether glycemic control goals are met as recommend - ed.It can also help prevent hypoglycemia and demonstrate the effectiveness of medication, exercise, and medical nutrition therapy (MNT).Clinicians should educate individuals on how to perform SMBG, interpret the results, and take appropriate actions based on those results, enabling patients to monitor their blood glucose levels independently [120].The number of tests needed will vary depending on the type of diabetes, medi - cations used, commitment to glycemic control, and knowledge of diabetes [121,122].
In studies of individuals with T2DM not treated with insulin, those who underwent systematic educa - tion in SMBG exhibited HbA1c levels that were 0.3% to 0.6% lower compared to the control group [123,124]. When performing SMBG, inaccuracies in the glucose meter and lack of proficiency in the measurement technique can lead to errors.There is always a device-dependent discrepancy be - tween blood glucose levels measured by a self-testing glucom - eter using a finger-stick capillary blood sample and those mea - sured in a laboratory using a venous blood sample.The Inter - national Organization for Standardization (ISO) and U.S.Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards are commonly used as a standard for glucose meter accuracy [120,125].
ISO standards approve a margin of error of ±15 mg/dL for blood glucose levels below 100 mg/dL and ±15% for levels Recommendation 6.1-2) Test HbA1c levels more frequently when glycemic fluctuations are severe, when medications are changed, and when tight glycemic control is needed (e.g., in pregnancy). [Uncontrolled studies, general recommendation]Recommendation 6.2-1) Educate individuals on SMBG, and check methods and accuracy frequently.[Expert opinion, general recom - mendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea569 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgabove 100 mg/dL [120].To ensure accuracy, individuals should compare their blood glucose with a lab test at least once a year.Moreover, individuals should compare self-test glucose levels to laboratory glucose values if HbA1c and self-test values are significantly different.
Most errors in SMBG are due to inexpe - rience with the method, so regular refresher training is neces - sary to improve accuracy [126]. Risks To perform SMBG effectively, systematic training on using the devices and interpreting blood glucose values is important.Unfortunately, some institutions cannot offer this kind of train - ing or provide feedback on self-management.Additionally, it is difficult to compare and evaluate the accuracy and superiority of various self-blood glucose monitoring devices.Balancing the benefits and risks Errors can occur in SMBG, but these can be prevented with systematic training and consistent monitoring.In primary care settings where systematic education may be challenging, the ef - fectiveness of lifestyle modifications achievable through SMBG might be limited.To overcome this limitation, various educa - tional resources such as reports and booklets provided by vari - ous organizations can be utilized to improve self-management.
Alternatives and considerations If in-person training is not feasible, individuals with diabetes can utilize Internet resources, booklets, and other training methods. Level of evidence Recommendations are based on RCTs.Benefits Large-scale studies targeting patients undergoing insulin ther - apy have shown that SMBG plays a crucial role in the preven - tion of diabetes complications that can be achieved through ac - tive blood glucose control [91].A study of 27,000 children with T1DM showed that more frequent SMBG led to lower HbA1c levels and a lower incidence of acute complications [127].In individuals with T2DM treated with insulin, those who fre -quently performed SMBG had lower HbA1c levels [128].There is not enough evidence to show a relationship between the fre - quency of SMBG and glycemic control for people with T2DM who use basal insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.
However, individuals with T2DM who are treated with basal insulin and self-adjust their insulin dose by measuring their fasting blood glucose have been found to have lower HbA1c levels [129,130]. Risks People are often deterred by the need for blood draws during SMBG, and the testing is less effective without proper educa - tion.Balancing the benefits and risks All studies have supported the benefits of SMBG in individuals treated with insulin.Although it is an invasive test, the benefits of glycemic control, prevention of hypoglycemia, and diabetes complications make it appropriate to recommend SMBG.Alternatives and considerations If SMBG is challenging, CGM or HbA1c can be used to assess the level of glycemic control.However, CGM is also effective only when sufficient education has been provided.Level of evidence Due to the lack of large-scale RCTs or observational studies, recommendations are based on the opinion of experts.
Benefits The benefits of SMBG in individuals with T2DM who are not using insulin therapy are not well-established. Some studies with well-designed educational programs for self-monitoring showed no improvement in glycemic control [131-135].Nev - ertheless, SMBG can help individuals with diabetes become more aware of their diet, exercise, and the effectiveness of their diabetes medication on their blood glucose levels.Therefore, it should be actively encouraged.SMBG is also helpful in detect - ing hypoglycemia, monitoring blood glucose changes in the presence of other health comorbidities, and determining the degree of discrepancy with the actual blood glucose levels if the accuracy of the HbA1c test is in question.Recommendation 6.2-2) Individuals with T1DM or adults with T2DM who are on insulin therapy should perform SMBG.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation]Recommendation 6.2-3) Adults with T2DM who are not on insulin therapy should consider self-monitoring their blood glucose levels. [Expert opinion, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.570 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgIn a year-long study of T2DM patients not receiving insulin therapy, the HbA1c levels were 0.3% lower in the group that conducted SMBG compared to the control group that did not perform any testing [123].However, in another study, partici - pants were divided into three groups for a year-long observa - tion: one that performed SMBG once a day, another that con - ducted SMBG and received education, and a control group that did nothing.There was no difference in HbA1c levels among the three groups [134].A meta-analysis reported that SMBG led to a 0.30% reduction in HbA1c after 6 months, but there was lit - tle effect after 12 months [135].
Moreover, the study revealed that SMBG was more effective when combined with education, but no significant change in glycemic control was observed without treatment modification [136]. Therefore, the effective - ness of SMBG in non-insulin-treated individuals with T2DM may be attributed to adequate education, treatment modifica - tion, and its application to self-management rather than the test itself.Risks The evidence is not as strong as in studies of insulin-treated in - dividuals, and there are costs and there are costs and efforts re - quired for education and self-management fees that should ac - company SMBG.Balancing the benefits and risks Despite the lack of evidence, it is recommended that individu - als with T2DM learn to test their blood glucose in order to benefit from lifestyle modification effects such as preventing hypoglycemia, improving self-care, and controlling diet.
Alternatives and considerations If individuals with diabetes have difficulty testing their own blood glucose level, they can use the CGM or HbA1c test. However, CGM is only effective when proper training is pro - vided.Level of evidence Recommendations are based on the opinion of experts.Benefits SMBG can be helpful for the patient’s self-management and lifestyle modification and can assist in accurate blood glucose measurement.The testing frequency depends on the type of di - abetes, the medication prescribed, and the patient’s knowledge and proactivity in controlling their blood glucose [121,122].Although the 2-hour postprandial blood glucose test (2 hours after starting the meal) correlates more with HbA1c, individu - als with uncontrolled diabetes are more influenced by fasting glucose level [137,138].Therefore, if possible, measuring both pre-prandial and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose is recom - mended.
Risks SMBG requires blood collection, which may cause discomfort for the patient. If it is not accompanied by sufficient education, its effectiveness can be reduced.Additionally, frequent mea - surements can cause inconvenience in daily life.Balancing the benefits and risks Despite the inconvenience and cost, several studies have shown that frequent testing correlates with better glycemic control.Therefore, frequent testing is recommended.Alternatives and considerations CGM is available but is more expensive than self-testing.See section ‘Continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps.’ See section ‘Continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps.’Recommendation 6.2-4) SMBG can be done before and after the meal, before bedtime, at dawn, before and after exercise, and in the event of hypoglycemia, and the time and frequency of measure - ments can be individualized based on the patient’s condition.

[Randomized controlled trial, general recom - mendation] Recommendation 7.2 Education on MNT should be provided by RDNs who are qualified for diabetes education.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.572 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgLevel of evidence When overweight or obese adults with diabetes (or prediabe - tes) lose and maintain a weight loss of at least 5% of their body weight by reducing caloric intake in combination with ade - quate exercise, insulin sensitivity, blood glucose, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were improved [55,56,143,144].
Short-term, very low-calorie meal plans (<800 kcal/day) have shown to be beneficial in weight loss and glycemic control without signifi - cant risks in some people [145], and these improvements re - mained when a weight loss of 7% or more was maintained for 5 years [146]. As a result, major diabetes guidelines recommend a weight loss of at least 5% in overweight or obese adults.In the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT), participants (in - dividuals who had been diagnosed with T2DM within the past 6 years) currently taking only oral antidiabetic medications were enrolled in a 1-year weight loss program, which included eating a diet of 825 to 853 kcal/day for the first 3 to 5 months.Results showed that 46% achieved diabetes remission, and this effect was proportional to the amount of weight lost [147].
Benefits In overweight or obese people with diabetes, a weight loss of at least 5% combined with calorie intake restriction and appro - priate lifestyle modifications, including exercise, was associat - ed with improved metabolic markers, such as blood glucose, and reduced CVD risk. Depending on the patient, greater weight loss may result in more significant gains, and maintain - ing this weight loss results in sustained benefits.Risks In people with diabetes who are using insulin or sulfonylureas, low-calorie, and very low-calorie meal plans may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.Excessive dietary restriction can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, and the risk of ketoacidosis should be considered in people taking SGLT2 inhibitors [148].Lower calorie meal plans are more difficult to adhere to, and their long-term effectiveness and safety need to be better estab - lished [149].
Balancing the benefits and risks In overweight or obese people with diabetes (or prediabetes), reducing total caloric intake, losing weight, and maintaining weight loss with an appropriate exercise regimen have signifi - cant benefits in preventing diabetes, improving blood glucose levels, and reducing CVD risk. There are concerns about hypo -Level of evidence An individualized MNT program provided by RDNs has con - sistently shown multiple benefits, including improved glyce - mic control, weight loss, and reduced blood pressure [139].Most diabetes guidelines recommend active implementation of MNT, and recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses sup - port this recommendation [140].Benefits In people with diabetes, MNT reduces HbA1c by 0.3% to 2.0% [139], and has shown also to reduce body weight, waist circum - ference, cholesterol, and blood pressure [140].
In one study on adults with prediabetes, the MNT-implemented group showed significant glycemic improvement compared to the control group [141]. Furthermore, MNT provided by RDNs has proven to be cost-effective [139,142].Risks There are no risks in implementing MNT when educated by an appropriately qualified clinical dietitian.Balance the benefits and risks MNT lowers blood glucose and CVD risk without evidence of harm.It is cost-effective when provided by RDNs with exper - tise in diabetes education.Alternatives, considerations when using the guidelines MNT plays an essential role in the prevention and treatment of diabetes.People with diabetes need individualized MNTs based on their medical status, treatment goals, and personal prefer - ences.MNT provided by RDNs should be reimbursed with an appropriate insurance plan in a cost-effective manner.
Caregiv - ers and people with diabetes should be actively involved in the whole nutrition therapy process, starting from the nutritional status assessment and meal planning, followed by regular reas - sessment and education sessions. RDNs should strive for a comprehensive understanding and up-to-date knowledge of diabetes and should receive continuous education to maintain their credentials.Recommendation 7.3 Overweight or obese adults should achieve a weight loss of at least 5% and reduce their total calorie intake to maintain it.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea573 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgglycemia and deficiencies of essential nutrients, but these can be prevented with appropriate medical evaluation and educa - tion.
Therefore, all people with diabetes (or prediabetes) who are overweight or obese are recommended to restrict their total caloric intake to lose and maintain at least 5% of their body weight. However, this is not recommended in individuals at high risk for malnutrition, older adults, pregnant or lactating women, or those with kidney disease [139], and caution is war - ranted in SGLT2 inhibitor users.Alternatives and considerations Reducing total calorie intake for weight loss is individualized based on the patient’s age, gender, height, weight, current in - take and activity levels, medical conditions, and personal pref - erences and sustainability [139].There are several methods for determining a target intake, but it is only a guide and should be individualized based on an individual’s current intake, target body weight, glycaemic goals and feasibility.
Level of evidence No ideal proportion of carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake has consistently demonstrated benefit in the treatment of diabetes [139]. Therefore, major diabetes guidelines do not provide spe - cific intake proportions for these macronutrients and recom - mend individualized proportions depending on an individual’s metabolic goals, which are based on current medical condi - tions, eating patterns, and personal preferences.Many studies have reported that reducing carbohydrate intake is effective in improving blood glucose levels [150-152].Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also shown consistent results [153- 155].A recent meta-analysis evaluated the dose-dependent ef - fect of carbohydrate restriction; blood glucose decreased lin - early with the decrease in carbohydrate intake, and U-shaped effects were observed for serum lipids at 40% carbohydrate in - take [156].
Another systematic review and meta-analysis found that consuming a diet with a carbohydrate proportion of ≤26% of the total calorie intake was associated with a significantly higher rate of diabetes remission at 6 months compared to the control group, with no difference in adverse events [157].Benefits Although there is a lack of evidence that specific proportions of carbohydrates, proteins, and fat are beneficial in diabetes, re - ducing carbohydrate intake is effective in improving blood glu - cose levels. Risks There is a risk of hypoglycemia when carbohydrate intake is drastically reduced in insulin or sulfonylureas users.Reducing carbohydrate intake alone without reducing total caloric intake means increasing intake of other caloric nutrients such as pro - tein and fat, and the potential for increased intake of animal- derived saturated fats should be considered.
Excessive low-car - bohydrate meal plans can lead to deficiencies in essential nu - trients [139], and the risk of ketoacidosis must be considered in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors [148]. Balancing the benefits and risks There are no ideal proportions of carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake that have consistently shown benefits for all people with diabetes.Therefore, individualization based on a careful assess - ment of each individual’s medical condition, metabolic goals, and preferences is recommended.While it may be worthwhile to reduce total carbohydrate intake to improve blood glucose, excessively low-carbohydrate meal plans are not recommended in individuals at high risk for malnutrition, older adults, and pregnant or lactating women [139], and caution is warranted in those taking SGLT2 inhibitors.
Alternatives and considerations Although prospective studies on the appropriate carbohydrate intake in Korean people with diabetes are lacking, given that 65% to 70% of total energy intake comes from carbohydrates, which is higher than the proportion in other countries [158], recommending a reduction in carbohydrate intake may be beneficial in improving blood glucose levels. Therefore, in Ko - reans with diabetes, carbohydrate intake should be reduced to ≤55% to 65% of total energy [159], but the specific amount should be individualized according to each individual’s current medical condition and metabolic goals.Recommendation 7.4 The proportion of intake of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats should be individualized based on treatment goals and personal preferences.
[Randomized controlled trial, general rec - ommendation] Recommendation 7.5 Eating patterns that have demonstrated long-term benefits, such as the Mediterranean style, vegetarian, low-fat, DASH, and low-carbohydrate eating patterns, may be im - Moon JS, et al.574 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgLevel of evidence Many previous studies have shown the benefits of Mediterra - nean style, vegetarian, low-fat, low-carbohydrate, and DASH eating patterns demonstrate benefits in improving blood glu - cose levels, reducing weight, and reducing CVD risks. Accord - ingly, the ADA guideline recommends the implementation of these eating patterns in MNT [139].A network meta-analysis and systematic review have also shown consistent results about the benefits of these eating patterns [151].Recent studies have shown that time-restricted eating (including intermittent fast - ing) is beneficial for weight loss and glycemic control [160- 162].
However, evidence on the benefits of this eating pattern in people with diabetes is still lacking [163,164]. Although there are reports of increased risk of hypoglycemia despite im - proved metabolic markers with medication adjustments and education [165], the few intervention studies to date have re - ported no safety concerns when medications are well moni - tored [166].As a result, the recent ADA guidelines include time-restricted eating as a type of eating pattern [167].Howev - er, the specific methods vary across studies, leading to limita - tions in interpretation and application, and there is still a lack of research on long-term effects.Benefits Mediterranean style, vegetarian, low-fat, low-carbohydrate, and DASH eating patterns have been shown to have long-term benefits in glycemic control, weight loss, and CVD risk reduc - tion.Some studies reported the association of time-restricted eating with short-term weight loss and glycemic improvement.
However, there is insufficient evidence on the benefits and long-term effects in people with diabetes. Risks There are no known harms of the Mediterranean style, vege - tarian, low-fat, low-carbohydrate, or DASH eating patterns.Time-restricted eating may increase the risk of hypoglycemia during fasting, and compensatory binge eating may cause postprandial blood glucose to spike, leading to greater glyce - mic variability.Evidence on the long-term safety of timed eat - ing is lacking.Balancing the benefits and risks The Mediterranean style, vegetarian, low-fat, low-carbohy - drate, and DASH eating patterns have proven long-term bene - fits and safety for improving blood glucose and preventing CVD.In addition, these diets offer various meal options that are not too different from everyday meals and can be individu - alized upon consultation with RDNs to make them feasible and sustainable for people with diabetes.
While there is evi - dence for short-term benefits, time-restricted eating is associ - ated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia and glycemic vari - ability, and there is a lack of evidence on its long-term benefits and safety. Alternatives and considerations People with diabetes should not attempt dietary methods that have not proven their efficacy and safety, including time-re - stricted eating, without doctor consultation, as they are at in - creased risk of various adverse events compared to the general population.This is particularly true when trying extreme diets that largely deviate from the usual eating patterns or in people who take medications that increase the risk of hypoglycemia, such as insulin or sulfonylureas.People with CVD or compli - cations, elderly at increased risk of malnutrition, and pregnant and lactating women need special consideration.
Level of evidence Many studies have shown that consuming carbohydrates in the form of fiber-rich whole grains, legumes, vegetables, raw fruits, and dairy products instead of refined carbohydrates has a sig - nificant effect on preventing diabetes and CVD and improving blood glucose levels [168-170]. In people with diabetes, rou - tine dietary fiber consumption was associated with a signifi - cant decrease in mortality [171,172].In contrast, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages containing free sugars, such as added sugars used in processing or concentrated fruit juices, was associated with a significant increase in the incidence of diabetes [173,174].As a result, major diabetes guidelines rec - ommend minimizing added sugar intake and replacing it with plemented according to personal preferences and treatment goals.
[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] Recommendation 7.6 Carbohydrates should be consumed as fi - ber-rich whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fresh fruits, and dairy products. [Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 7.7 Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is discouraged to minimize added sugar intake.[Randomized con - trolled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea575 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgfiber-rich foods, emphasizing the quality of carbohydrates con - sumed.Recent observational studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have also shown consistent results [175,176].Previous studies have shown no benefit in glycemic manage - ment from nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs) [177], and results were inconsistent for weight loss [178-180].Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also shown that NNSs does not improve glycemic management [180].
Benefits Minimizing added sugar intake and consuming carbohydrates as fiber-rich food have proven to be beneficial in preventing diabetes, improving glycemic management, preventing CVD, and reducing mortality. The benefits of using calorie-free and carbohydrate-free NNSs are inconclusive.Consumption of beverages (carbonated beverages, sports drinks, coffee, tea, ca - cao beverages, and fruit juices made from concentrated fruit juices) containing added sugars, such as sugar and syrups, is discouraged.Short-term substitution with NNSs has been re - ported to reduce added sugar intake [181], and a recent net - work meta-analysis found that postprandial glycemic and metabolic responses to NNSs-sweetened beverages were simi - lar to those seen with water [182].Risks While there is no known harm when consuming carbohydrates in the form of fiber-rich foods with minimal intake of added sugars, it is important to be aware of potential risks.
Caution is necessary for individuals with severely reduced renal function or those taking certain medications, as electrolyte abnormalities such as hyperkalemia may occur. Recently, there have been in - creased reports of adverse events regarding NNSs intake [181].NNSs has been reported to impair glycemic responses depend - ing on the individual’s gut microbiome [183] and may also be associated with increased CVD risk [184,185].Balancing the benefits and risks Reducing sugar intake and consuming carbohydrates in the form of fiber-rich whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fresh fruits, and dairy products is recommended for glycemic management, CVD prevention, and mortality reduction, as there is no general harm.However, fruits that are high in sugars may raise blood glucose levels and should be consumed in moderation, espe - cially if those comsumed in the form of concentrated juices, which may cause a significant increase in blood glucose levels.
Although evidence for NNSs in glycemic improvement and weight loss is insufficient, NNSs may be considered for short- term use in individuals who have difficulties in reducing added sugar consumption. Alternatives and considerations Studies in the United States and Canada recommended a di - etary fiber intake of at least 14 g per 1,000 kcal to prevent CVD.However, in Korea, the recommended intake is 12 g per 1,000 kcal, calculated based on the estimated average dietary fiber in - take in the 1960s to 1970s [159].The average dietary fiber in - take of South Koreans in 2016 to 2018 was 11 g per 1,000 kcal, which is lower than the recommended intake of 12 g [159].Therefore, despite the lack of scientific evidence for the recom - mended dietary fiber intake in Korea, this recommendation has remained without further adjustments.
The 2020 Korean Di - etary Reference Intakes (KDRI) recommends limiting sugars to 10% to 20% of total energy intake and added sugars to 10% of total calories [159]. NNSs can help reduce sugar intake in the short term, but ultimately, it is important to reduce the con - sumption of all beverages, even those containing NNSs, and re - place them with water [181].To ensure adequate carbohydrate intake, metrics such as the glycemic index and glycemic load can help manage postprandial glucose levels, though they may not be completely reliable [186,187].Level of evidence There is a lack of evidence on the appropriate amount of pro - tein intake and the benefits of protein restriction on glycemic management and CVD risk in people with diabetes [139,188].
Traditionally, protein restriction has been proposed to delay the progression of kidney disease in patients with albuminuria or reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but many studies have shown that even in the aforementioned cases, evidence on protein restriction is insufficient. As a result, major diabetes guidelines recommend the same amount of protein intake for people with diabetic nephropathy as the general population.A recent systematic review and meta-analysis have also shown consistent results [189].Recommendation 7.8 Protein intake need not be limited, even in people with renal diseases.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.576 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgBenefits Evidence on the benefits of a stricter protein restriction in peo - ple with diabetes and those with diabetic nephropathy than the general population is insufficient.
Risks Limiting protein intake to less than 0.8 g/kg/day can lead to not only protein deficiency but also inadequate intake of vari - ous nutrients [190,191]. Balancing the benefits and risks Protein intake need not be restricted in people with diabetes as the evidence of its benefits is lacking.Even in people with kid - ney diseases, evidence on protein restriction is insufficient and instead poses an increased potential for harm, including mal - nutrition; therefore, protein intake need not be more strictly restricted.Alternatives and considerations Protein accounts for 13% to 15% of total daily energy intake for adults in Korea, including people with diabetes [158].In the past, protein intake in Korea was lower than the recommended amount.Recently, except for women of ≥75 years old, the aver - age intake has increased to above the recommended amount, though excessive intake is not yet a cause for concern [159].
It is not necessary to generally restrict protein intake in Koreans with diabetes, but the intake should be individualized according to the individual’s eating patterns, glycemic management, and metabolic goals. Since protein can increase the insulin response to carbohydrates, carbohydrate sources such as milk with high protein content should not be used to treat hypoglycemia [192].Level of evidence Numerous studies have shown that replacing foods high in sat - urated or trans fats with those rich in unsaturated fats benefits glycemic management and reduces the risk of CVD [193-197].A recent systematic review and meta-analysis have also shown consistent findings [198].However, there is insufficient evi -dence to support the routine administration of unsaturated fat supplementation to improve glycemic management and pre - vent cardiovascular events in people with diabetes.
Previous studies have failed to prove the preventive effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on cardiovascular events in people with diabetes [199]. A recent meta-analysis found that unsatu - rated fats supplementation had little or no effect on diabetes in - cidence, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose level, insulin secretion, or insulin resistance [200].In the Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes, daily supplementation with 1 g of omega-3 fatty acids did not show a preventive effect on cardiovascular events in diabetic people without CVD [201].However, in the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With Icosapent Ethyl-In - tervention Trial, in which more than 50% of the participants were people with diabetes, daily 4 g eicosapentaenoic acid sup - plementation lowered the risk of cardiovascular events in pa - tients with atherosclerotic CVD with triglycerides level be - tween 135 and 499 mg/dL, despite the use of statins [202].
Benefits Reducing the consumption of foods high in saturated and trans fats and replacing them with those rich in unsaturated fats is ef - fective in improving blood glucose levels and preventing CVD. However, supplementation of unsaturated fats in the general diabetes population has not been proven to improve blood glu - cose levels or prevent CVD.Risks Given that the total calories and the proportion of fats are not excessive, limiting the consumption of foods high in saturated and trans fats and increasing consumption of foods rich in un - saturated fats are known to have no harms.There are no known harms in taking unsaturated fats supplementation, but this is not recommended as there is a lack of evidence for its safety.Balancing the benefits and risks In terms of fat intake, the quality is more important than abso - lute quantity or proportion [139].
Limiting the intake of foods high in saturated and trans fats and replacing them with foods rich in unsaturated fats can be generally recommended with - out significant risks, as it is expected to improve glycemic con - trol and reduce CVD risk. However, supplementation of un - saturated fats, including omega-3 fatty acids, for the prevention and treatment of CVD in all people with diabetes is not recom - mended because of the lack of evidence of its effects.Recommendation 7.9 Food rich in saturated and trans fats should be replaced with food rich in unsaturated fats.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 7.10 General administration of unsaturated fat as dietary supplements is not recommended.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea577 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgAlternatives and considerations According to the KNHANES, the proportion of energy intake from fat among Koreans ranges from 13% to 26% depending on age, which is lower than that of Western countries [159]. The 2020 KDRI suggested that the appropriate energy intake from fats for adults is 15% to 30% of total calories, and the 2022 Korean Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemia recommended limiting fat intake within 30% of daily energy intake.It is recommended to limit cholesterol to within 300 mg per day, to limit saturated fats to within 7% of total energy in - take and replace them with unsaturated fats as much as possi - ble, and to avoid the intake of trans fats.Level of evidence Many observational and RCTs have shown that sodium restric - tion reduces blood pressure and CVD risk [203-207].
A meta- analysis has showed that reducing sodium intake in people with T1DM and T2DM improves blood pressure [208], and another RCT showed that in people with T2DM, limiting sodi - um intake to an average of 2,310 mg per day, along with the DASH diet, improved CVD risk factors, including blood pres - sure [209]. Based on these findings, most hypertension and di - abetes guidelines recommend limiting sodium intake ideally to within 2,300 mg per day when possible.While the evidence for the benefits of sodium restriction is clear, there is a lack of evi - dence supporting the recommendation that the appropriate sodium intake is within 2,300 mg.Benefits In people with diabetes, hypertension and CVD are among the most critical comorbidities, and controlling blood pressure is essential to delay the development of diabetes complications.Therefore, reducing sodium intake may help lower blood pres - sure and delay the development of CVD and diabetic compli - cations.
Risks There is no evidence of harm in restricting daily sodium in - take, especially in populations with high-sodium intake, such as Korea.Balancing the benefits and risks Reducing sodium consumption may lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of CVD and the occurrence of diabetes compli - cations development without concerns of specific harms. Al - though prospective studies focusing on Koreans are lacking, clinical benefits may be expected from sodium restriction in a population with high-sodium intake, such as Korea.There is a lack of evidence to warrant more stringent sodium intake re - strictions forpeople with hypertension and diabetes compared to the general population [210,211]; therefore, the same level of recommendation is advised for people with diabetes as for the general population.
Although there is insufficient evidence to justify the recommendation of a daily sodium intake limit of 2,300 mg, the consensus should be understood more as a direc - tion to reduce overall excessive sodium consumption, which can help in improving blood pressure and CVD risk, rather than as an absolute target. Alternatives and considerations The 2020 KDRI revised the recommended daily allowance of sodium to within 2,300 mg to reduce the risk of chronic dis - eases [159].Many clinical guidelines, including those from the ADA, recommended a sodium limit of less than 2,300 mg, and the 2022 guideline from Korean Society of Hypertension rec - ommended a daily salt restriction of 6 g to lower blood pres - sure.The 2023 diabetes treatment guidelines maintained sodi - um intake restriction for people with diabetes to within 2,300 mg as revised in 2021.
Efforts to reduce sodium intake resulted in a significant decrease in the average daily sodium intake in Korea to 3,038 mg in 2021 from 4,549 mg in 2012, according to the KNHANES [212]. However, this is still above the global recommendation of 2,000 to 2,400 mg, and persistent efforts to reduce sodium intake are necessary.Level of evidence There are many studies on the benefits of micronutrient sup - plementation for improving glycemic management, weight loss, and CVD risk in adults with diabetes.However, due to differences in participant characteristics and research methods in these studies, the consistent benefit of micronutrient supple -Recommendation 7.11 A sodium restriction of less than 2,300 mg per day is recommended.[Randomized controlled trial, general rec - ommendation] Recommendation 7.12 Routine administration of micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, as dietary supplements to improve blood glucose levels is not recommended.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.578 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgmentation has not been proven [139]. Based on observational studies suggesting that vitamin D deficiency increases insulin resistance and the risk of developing T2DM, many prospective studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have been con - ducted.Some reported that vitamin D supplementation could prevent diabetes [213,214] and improve blood glucose levels [215].However, these studies often used doses of vitamin D much higher than those used for osteoporosis treatment, typi - cally more than 5,000 IU daily, were short-term and small- scale, and mostly failed to prove the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation.
A recently published large-scale RCT, in which 2,400 people with prediabetes received a daily vitamin D dose of 4,000 IU, has also failed to prove the protective effect of vitamin D against diabetes, regardless of underlying vitamin D deficiency [216]. Therefore, the evidence for vitamin D sup - plementation to improve glycemic management remains in - sufficient to recommend it in major diabetes guidelines.Benefits The benefits of supplementation with antioxidants such as vita - min C, vitamin E, and carotenes, as well as micronutrients like chromium, magnesium, and selenium are unclear [139].De - spite accumulating research on the benefits of vitamin D on im - proving blood glycemic control, the evidence is still not suffi - cient.
In addition, a variety of foods and plants (aloe vera, cin - namon, curcumin, Jerusalem artichoke, bitter melon, etc.) and its processed products that have been reported to improve gly - cemic management in different countries and cultures also do not have enough evidence to support their benefits. Risks There is a lack of evidence that the routine administration of micronutrient supplements such as vitamins and minerals is harmful, but there is also a lack of evidence on its safety from long-term consumption in excessive amounts.However, recent reports of the association of β-carotene with increased mortali - ty from lung cancer and CVD [217] have led the ADA guideline to suggest that supplementation of β-carotene may pose a risk to some people [167].
Balancing the benefits and risks Since there is insufficient evidence that micronutrient supple - ments prevent diabetes or improve blood glucose levels, their use for improving blood glucose in people with diabetes is generally not recommended. However, supplement use may be considered in cases where nutrient deficiencies are confirmed or likely, such as pregnant or lactating women, the elderly, veg - etarians, and those on very low-calorie or low-carbohydrate eating patterns [139].Alternatives and considerations Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that constitute and regulate many biological reactions.It is recommended to consume these nutrients in the form of whole grains, fresh vegetables and fruits, and dairy products, rather than in sup - plements.Rather than focusing on the effects of specific mi - cronutrients and their supplements, it is recommended to con - sume a variety of nutrients through a diverse diet.
The socio - economic costs associated with the use of unproven micronu - trient and dietary supplements, as well as considerations for the manufacturing process and safety of additives, also need to be taken into account. The association between long-term use of metformin, the most widely used oral antidiabetic agent, and vitamin B12 deficiency has been reported.Therefore, it is advised to test for vitamin B12 in patients who have been tak - ing metformin for a long period and exhibit unexplained ane - mia or peripheral neuropathy [218].Level of evidence Previous observational studies, systematic reviews, and meta- analyses have shown a J-shaped association between alcohol consumption and the risk of developing diabetes, where mod - erate amounts are beneficial, and excessive amounts increase harm.This pattern has also been observed in studies involving people with diabetes [219].
Consequently, many clinical guide - lines permit moderate drinking for adults with diabetes, simi - lar to the general population, and recent meta-analyses of co - hort studies support this conclusion [220]. Benefits Some studies have shown that consuming 5 to 25 g of alcohol per day may reduce the risk of diabetes [219,221].Recommendation 7.13 Abstinence from alcohol, when possible, is recommended.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 7.14 Insulin or insulin secretagogue users should be educated on preventing hypoglycemia when drinking alcohol.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea579 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgRisks Systematic reviews and meta-analyses, as well as prospective observational studies in Korea have shown that excessive alco - hol consumption (>30 g/day) can increase the risk of diabetes, hyperglycemia, and weight gain [219-221].
Furthermore, alco - hol consumption in people on insulin or insulin secretagogues has been associated with a higher risk of hypoglycemia [222]. Balancing the benefits and risks In patients with diabetes who do not have complications or liv - er disease and who maintain good glycemic control, it is not necessary to prohibit alcohol consumption outright, and the intake guidelines can be the same as for the general population.The WHO recommends limiting alcohol consumption to no more than one standard drink for women and two standard drinks for men (based on commonly used glasses for each type of alcohol) and abstaining from alcohol at least 2 days per week [223].Although there is a lack of evidence on the appropriate amount of alcohol consumption for Koreans, the same guide - line may be applied.
However, many individuals may find it difficult to control the amount and frequency of their alcohol consumption, and in diabetes, alcohol can exacerbate various health problems that often accompany the disease. Therefore, it is considered more beneficial to encourage abstinence from al - cohol rather than permitting it, based on the consensus of nu - merous experts recommending abstinence where possible.People using insulin or insulin secretagogues should be advised to eat adequately when drinking to avoid SH and to frequently monitor their blood glucose levels before and after drinking to prevent hypoglycemia.Moon JS, et al.580 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.org8.EXERCISE THERAPY 1.Individualize the type, frequency, duration, and intensity of physical exercise based on the individual’s age, physical capacity, and comor - bidities.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 2.

[Expert opinion, general recom - mendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea581 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgLevel of evidence Although physical exercise is recommended for glycemic con - trol, physical fitness, and cardiorespiratory fitness, it may be limited to people with CVD or microvascular complications.Precautions are required to avoid additional injuries and harm during exercise.These individualized recommendations are based on high-quality international guidelines and the opin - ions of diabetes specialists and exercise professionals.
Benefits When exercising at intensities higher than brisk walking, it is advisable to consider the individual’s age and previous physical activity level before starting the exercise and to assess the pres - ence of CVD, severe hypertension, and microvascular compli - cations such as severe retinopathy/autonomic neuropathy/pe - ripheral neuropathy. When beginning an exercise regimen, it is beneficial to receive guidance from a professional to ensure that the exercise is performed accurately, effectively, and safely, and, if possible, to seek an exercise prescription from an exercise spe - cialist.Risks Exercise tolerance testing is not necessary for asymptomatic di - abetics with a 10-year risk of coronary artery disease of less than 10%, as the harms of false-positive results are greater [224,225].
Balancing the benefits and risks In people with diabetes with proliferative retinopathy or severe non-proliferative retinopathy, high-intensity aerobic or resis - tance exercises are contraindicated due to an increased risk of retinal hemorrhage or detachment [226,227]. Reduced pain sensation in the upper or lower extremities increases the risk of skin ulcers, infections, and Charcot’s joints.Therefore, diabetic individuals with peripheral neuropathy should be educated to wear appropriate footwear and monitor their feet daily to detect lesions early.Individuals with severe diabetic neuropathy are recommended to engage in low-impact exercises, such as swim - ming, cycling, and arm exercises [228,229].
Autonomic neurop - athy can reduce the cardiac response to exercise and cause or - thostatic hypotension, impair thermoregulation, night vision, and thirst, and cause gastroparesis, all of which can lead to vari - ous exercise-related adverse events and increase cardiovascular complications. Therefore, diabetic individuals with autonomic neuropathy are recommended to undergo a thorough cardio - vascular evaluation before beginning exercise [230,231].Level of evidence Research on the timing and extent of insulin reduction before and after exercise has primarily focused on people with T1DM who use insulin pumps or multiple insulin injections.As the response to exercise varies among individuals, it is not easy to make a general recommendation based on the exercise meth - ods used in each study.Professional opinions and individual - ized recommendations are essential to identify fluctuations in blood glucose levels and to prevent hypoglycemia in patients at high risk for hypoglycemia.
Benefits Measuring pre-exercise blood glucose levels can aid in predict - ing and preparing for hypoglycemia, as it is an important pre - dictor of exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Risks Exercise can lead to hypoglycemia in people on insulin or in - sulin secretagogues.For people with T1DM, the fear of hypo - glycemia is one of the main reasons for their hesitation to exer - cise.A meta-analysis reported that HIIT tends to cause less hy - poglycemia in patients with T1DM than continuous aerobic exercises, although the difference was not significant [232].High-intensity exercise should be avoided in patients with ke - toacidosis.However, if there is no ketoacidosis and the overall condition is good, there is no need to delay or avoid exercise due to hyperglycemia [233].
Balancing the benefits and risks Before and after exercise, when the overall condition changes, the intensity of exercise varies, or the duration of exercise in - creases, the blood sugar levels should be measured to detect hy - poglycemia or hyperglycemia. This is especially important for individuals with diabetes using insulin secretagogues or insulin, as measuring blood glucose before and after exercise helps to understand the changes in blood glucose levels during activity.If there is a high risk of hypoglycemia, it may be necessary to re -Recommendation 8.4 Pre-exercise blood glucose levels were mea - sured to determine the exercise method.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 8.5 Blood glucose levels were measured for hy - poglycemia or hyperglycemia when the intensity or duration of ex - ercise increased.
[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.582 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgduce the dose of insulin or medication before exercising or to consume a snack before exercising [234]. Level of evidence There are many RCTs and meta-analyses analyzing the effects of exercise on glucose control, physical fitness, and cardiorespi - ratory fitness in people with T1DM and T2DM.However, there were difficulties in interpreting the results uniformly due to dif - ferences in the type, method, intensity, and duration of exercise used in each study.Therefore, the evidence for this recommen - dation was based on studies that analyzed the degree of glyce - mic control, cardiorespiratory fitness, and metabolic markers in the general population with diabetes, not those focusing on a specific limited patient group.Benefits Regular exercise improves glucose control, reduces CVD risk, and contributes to weight loss [235].
It also has a preventive ef - fect on diabetes in people at high-risk groups [56]. Typical aer - obic exercises include walking, cycling, jogging, and swim - ming, whereas resistance exercises involve weight training us - ing equipment to work against weight or resistance [235].Boule et al.[236] conducted a meta-analysis of studies (12 aerobic and two resistance exercise studies) lasting more than 8 weeks on changes in HbA1c and BMI in people with T2DM, and found that HbA1c was significantly reduced in the exer - cise group, independent of weight loss.In addition, the reduc - tion in HbA1c was more pronounced in the higher intensity exercise group, suggesting that increasing exercise intensity may lead to improved fitness and better glucose control in cur - rently exercising people [237].A meta-analysis of 23 clinical studies on Koreans with T2DM also reported a significant re - duction in HbA1c with exercise, but no significant weight loss was observed [238].
Evidence on the benefits of exercise on HbA1c and glycemic management is more limited in people with T1DM than in those with T2DM. A meta-analysis of five studies examining the effect of exercise for 12 weeks or longer on people with T1DM found no difference in HbA1c, but did note improve - ments in key indicators such as body weight, BMI, peak oxy - gen uptake, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [239].An 11.4-year prospective observational study involving approximately 2,300 people with T1DM demonstrated that Recommendation 8.6 Engaging in both aerobic and resistance ex - ercises is recommended.[Randomized controlled trial, general rec - ommendation] Recommendation 8.7 Engage in ≥150 min/week of at least moder - ate-intensity aerobic exercise, spread over at least 3 days per week, with less than 2 consecutive days without exercise.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 8.8 For physically able people with T2DM who cannot exercise as recommended because of time restrictions, HIIT, a time-efficient alternative, is recommended. [Randomized con - trolled trial, limited recommendation] Recommendation 8.9 Engage in resistance exercises at least twice a week.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation]Table 7.Suggested strategies based on pre-exercise blood glucose levels Pre-exercise blood glucose levelsCarbohydrate intake or other actions <90 mg/dL Consume 15–30 g of fast-absorbing carbohydrates prior to the start of exercise, depending on the level of exercise: This may not be necessary for exercises of less than 30 minutes, or high-intensity exercises such as weight training or interval training.
Additional carbohydrate intake is required for prolonged moderate-intensity exercise (depending on blood glucose levels, consume an additional 0.5–1 g of carbohydrate per kg body weight every hour of exercise). 90–150 mg/dL Start consuming carbohydrates at the beginning of most exercise (0.5–1 g of carbohydrates per kg body weight every hour of exercise), depending on the type of exercise or insulin activity level.150–250 mg/dL Delay carbohydrate consumption until blood glucose decreases below 150 mg/dL, after starting an exercise.250–350 mg/dL Test for ketones and stop the exercise if a medium to high amount of ketones is detected.Start with low- to moderate-intensity exercise.Since high-intensity exercise can lead to hyperglycemia, these exercises should be delayed until blood glucose falls below 250 mg/dL.≥350 mg/dL Test for ketones and stop the exercise if a medium to high amount of ketones is detected.
If no ketones are detected, adjust the pre-exercise insulin dosage (generally to about 50%) based on insulin activity level. Start with low- to moderate-intensity exercise and avoid strenuous exercise until blood glucose levels fall.2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea583 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orghigher physical activity intensity was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality [240].It is ideal to perform moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise for at least 30 minutes as frequently as possible throughout the week, combining aerobic and resistance exercises unless contra - indicated [239].If daily aerobic exercise is challenging, the du - ration of exercise per session can be increased.At least 150 min - utes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week is recom - mended.
Exercise should be performed at least 3 days a week, and it is important to not skip more than 2 consecutive days since the effect of aerobic exercise on insulin sensitivity lasts 24 to 72 hours [241,242]. HIIT may be beneficial for individuals who exercise regular - ly or are physically capable.A meta-analysis of 13 RCTs com - paring 11 weeks or more of HIIT to moderate aerobic exercise or control (no exercise) groups in people with T2DM found that HIIT had more positive effects on HbA1c, body weight, and BMI than moderate aerobic exercise [243].However, there are limitations to the level of evidence due to heterogeneity in exercise methods among the included studies and the inclu - sion of studies with low-quality assessments, indicating the need for more extensive studies to verify long-term effects.Based on the current level of evidence, short-duration HIIT can be recommended for individuals with T2DM who cannot secure sufficient exercise time.
Resistance exercise improves insulin sensitivity to the same extent as aerobic exercise. Since resistance exercise does not in - crease the risk of cardiac ischemia or stroke compared to aero - bic exercise, it can also be recommended for middle-aged and elderly people with diabetes [244,245].Furthermore, combin - ing aerobic and resistance exercises has additional benefits for glycemic control [246,247].Unless contraindicated, resistance exercises should be performed at least twice a week [241,242].Risks Potential harm from exercise in people with diabetes includes injuries and soft tissue damage during exercise.Moderate-in - tensity or prolonged exercise can lead to hypoglycemia, where - as high-intensity exercise may cause hyperglycemia.People with high blood glucose levels should be cautious of rising blood glucose and ketone levels.Balancing the benefits and risks The glycemic benefits of exercise in T1DM remain unclear.
However, it also improves cardiorespiratory fitness and physi - cal strength. Therefore, unless contraindicated, exercise is rec - ommended with precautions for hypoglycemia.Level of evidence While there is an accumulating amount of research on the as - sociation of sedentary behavior with health and glycemic con - trol, controlled trials with interventions are still limited.Two recent RCTs have shown similar positive results, leading to recommendations for most people with diabetes.Benefits A recent study found that avoiding prolonged sitting and en - gaging in brief walks or light activity every 30 minutes can help improve glycemic control in inactive adults with T2DM [248].Another study found that light walking for 3 minutes at inter - vals of 60, 30, and 15 minutes during a 7-hour sitting period improved morning fasting blood glucose and overnight glucose variability.The more frequently participants got up to take short walks, the better the improvement [249].
Therefore, it is recom - mended to minimize the time spent sitting and frequently stand or engage in light physical activities to break up long periods of sitting.Recommendation 8.10 Minimize time spent in sedentary behav - iors and avoid prolonged sitting.

This should be regularly reassessed as the children or adolescents grow and their capacity for independent self-management evolves. [Expert opinion, general recom - mendation] Level of evidence The evidence for Recommendation 1 includes systematic re - views [250,251] and RCTs [252,253].Among the research, the systematic review conducted by Rytter et al.[251] to determine the effectiveness of educational programs in people with T1DM aged 16 years or older using insulin pumps included only nine studies among which were only one RCT.Another limitation was the excessive heterogeneity among the study de - signs.However, the included RCT was relatively well-designed and conducted with moderate to high quality; therefore, the level of evidence was rated as a RCT.A general recommenda - tion was rated as benefits outweighed risks.
Benefits People with T1DM using multiple daily insulin injections or an insulin pump should be educated to self-monitor blood glucose and appropriately adjust insulin dose based on carbo - hydrate intake, anticipated activity, and current glucose levels [252,254,255]. It is also recommended that people with T1DM be taught how to cope with circumstances in which insulin sensitivity is reconstituted (stress, infection, steroid use, etc.) or insulin pump use is unavailable [255].In a meta-analysis of adults with T1DM, carbohydrate counting was associated with a 0.64% reduction in HbA1c levels compared to usual or alter - native dietary advice alone [250].The 5-day Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating (DAFNE) pro - gram is a renowned insulin education program.A RCT showed that after receiving structured education on DAFNE, individuals could adjust their mealtime insulin doses according to circum - stances with flexible food intake.
Also, it had improved diabetes- 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea585 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgrelated quality of life and HbA1c levels [252]. Similar education programs are available in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austra - lia, and New Zealand.Alimentación Normal con Ajuste de Insu - lina (ANAIS) is the Spanish version of the DAFNE program and is a therapeutic education program for people with T1DM based on a flexible insulin regimen that adapts to the individual’s food intake [253].In a RCT, ANAIS did not show a significant im - provement in HbA1c levels but was found effective in terms of treatment satisfaction and achievement of individual-set goals [253].In addition, Rytter et al.[251] conducted a systematic re - view to determine the effectiveness of educational programs in people with T1DM aged 16 years or older using insulin pumps.
Although the lack of included studies and the heterogeneity of the study designs limit definitive conclusions, the results suggest that appropriate education in insulin pump users can help improve HbA1c levels, reduce hypoglycemic events, and enhance knowl - edge and skills on use of insulin pump [251]. The effectiveness of such education is expected to be en - hanced with appropriate feedback based on an assessment of the level of understanding and performance of people with di - abetes provided on an ongoing basis.Especially in children and adolescents, the help and support of parents/caregivers play an important role in the management of T1DM [256,257], and the role of parents/caregivers changes throughout the life course as the youth grows, develops, and acquires the need and desire for greater independent self-care skills [256-258].
There - fore, to ensure the best outcomes, both children and adoles - cents and their parents/caregivers should receive tailored edu - cation suited to their developmental stage as well as periodic reassessment. Risks The RCT assessing the effectiveness of the DAFNE program [252] found no negative impact on cardiovascular risk factors, such as body weight and cholesterol markers, or an increase in symptomatic hypoglycemia (SH).The average number of insu - lin injections per day increased after the program.In the RCT that examined the effectiveness of the ANAIS education pro - gram [253], researchers encountered issues with finding dedi - cated areas to educate and store training materials, securing staff for teaching, and ensuring participant attendance.
Balancing the benefits and risks The structured insulin education program for T1DM, DAFNE, has been shown to improve prandial insulin dose adjustment, dietary flexibility, diabetes-related quality of life, and HbA1c levels, while ANAIS has shown improvements in T1DM treat - ment satisfaction and user-set goal achievement. In addition, the systematic review by Rytter et al.[251] suggests that educa - tion for individuals using insulin pumps can help improve HbA1c levels, reduce the incidence of hypoglycemia, and im - prove knowledge and skills related to insulin pump use.Al - though implementing a structured insulin education program may lead to increased costs in terms of health providers, mate - rial, and time resources, there is no expected direct harm to in - dividuals with T1DM.
Although the average number of insulin injections per day increased in participants who underwent the DAFNE program, it is likely due to the need for more in - jections to achieve adequate glucose control in T1DM. There - fore, the benefits of the recommendation clearly outweigh the risks.Level of evidence The studies included in the analysis were the RCT by Little et al.[259] and their 24-month follow-up [260], where random - ization and blinding were well maintained and 76 of 96 partici - pants were followed up to 24 months.The characteristics of those who dropped out were similar to those enrolled.Taken together, the quality of evidence was rated as RCTs.Special - ized, structured education for preventing hypoglycemia and reestablishing hypoglycemia awareness in individuals with im - paired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) and T1DM clearly outweigh the risks; therefore, the level of recommendation was classified as a general recommendation.
Benefits To determine whether IAH could be improved and SH could be prevented in T1DM, Little et al. [259] conducted a 24-week 2×2 factorial RCT in 96 adults with T1DM and IAH by ran - domizing them into an insulin pump or MDIs as well as rtC - GM or SMBG.All participants received comparable structured education aimed at avoidance of hypoglycemia and restoring hypoglycemia awareness.Regardless of the insulin pump, MDIs use, rtCGM, and SMBG, the study showed decreased Recommendation 9.4 Adults with T1DM who have experienced hypoglycemia unawareness or SH should receive professional and specialized education to prevent hypoglycemia and restore hypo - glycemia awareness.[Randomized controlled trial, general recom - mendation] Moon JS, et al.586 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orghypoglycemia, including SH, and improved IAH without the relaxing HbA1c levels [259].
After the 24-week study period, the subjects were allowed to return to their usual care and were free to decide to receive either the insulin pump or MDIs. At 24 months from baseline, the improvement in IAH and reduc - tion in SH were sustained.In addition, the improvement in treatment satisfaction and the reduction in fear of hypoglyce - mia were sustained, with improved HbA1c compared to base - line without significant differences among the intervention groups [260].These results indicate that providing specialized and professional education to prevent hypoglycemia and re - store hypoglycemic awareness can improve IAH and reduce the incidence of SH in individuals with long-standing T1DM complicated by IAH and SH, and that the effects of such edu - cation are long-lasting [260].Risks In the 24-month follow-up report of a randomized controlled study by Little et al.
[260], it was reported that a total of six cas - es of ketoacidosis requiring hospitalization occurred, all of which recovered without any sequelae. These incidences are unlikely a risk associated with specialized education for pre - venting hypoglycemia and reestablishing hypoglycemia aware - ness [260].Furthermore, 12 serious adverse events were also reported in the study, all of which were unrelated to the study intervention [260].Professionalized and structured education for hypoglycemia prevention and restoration of hypoglycemia awareness requires adequately trained educational personnel, resources, and secured educational time.Balancing the benefits and risks In a 24-week RCT of adults with T1DM with IAH, specialized and structured training to prevent hypoglycemia and restore hypoglycemic awareness resulted in clear benefits in terms of improved hypoglycemia awareness and reduced SH, which were sustained through 24 months.
Improvements in HbA1c levels were seen at 24 months, along with improvements in treatment satisfaction and reduced fear of hypoglycemia. On the other hand, the risks of such systematic education are not clear, and the costs of educational personnel, resources, and training time are considered worthy.Therefore, the benefits of providing specialized, structured training for hypoglycemia prevention and restoration of hypoglycemic awareness in adults with T1DM and IAH clearly outweigh the risks.Level of evidence The studies included in the analysis were the DCCT [91], a RCT, the EDIC studies [103,113] that followed up the DCCT through 2005, and a systematic review of 11 RCTs described by Chico and Corcoy [261].
Upon strict examination, the study by Chico and Corcoy [261] which included 11 RCTs is not a systematic review due to the following reasons: the insuffi - ciently systematic search by using only one database search, no mentions on the inclusion criteria in advance, and no expres - sions of judgments on the exclusion of individual studies or an assessment of the bias risks of individual studies included in the study. Overall, the quality of evidence was rated as RCTs.As the benefits of the recommendation outweigh the risks, the recommendation was classified as a general recommendation.Benefits The DCCT study, conducted on patients with T1DM from 1983 to 1993, examined the impact of intensive insulin treat - ment, such as multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pumps, on reducing HbA1c levels below 7.0% compared to the conventional insulin treatment where insulin was adminis - tered once or twice-daily to control HbA1c levels to 9.0%.
The results showed that intensive insulin treatment reduced the in - cidence and progression of microvascular complications by 50% over 6 years [91]. The EDIC study followed up the DCCT study until 2005 and found that the intensive insulin treatment group resulted in reduced incidence and progression of micro - vascular complications, macrovascular complications, and mortality [103,113].A systematic review of 11 RCTs also con - cluded that intensive insulin treatment was superior in terms of reduction in HbA1c levels [261].Risks In the DCCT study, it was found that individuals receiving in - tensive insulin treatment had two to three times higher inci - dence of SH requiring assistance from others, as compared to those receiving conventional insulin treatment.
During the 1-year observation of 100 subjects, there were 62 episodes of SH in the intensive insulin treatment group and 19 episodes in Recommendation 9.5 Treat adults with T1DM using MDIs of prandial and basal insulin or insulin pumps (continuous subcutane - ous insulin infusion). [Randomized controlled trial, general recom - mendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea587 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgthe conventional insulin treatment group [91].The study was carried out with a combination of neutral protamine hagedon (NPH) and regular insulin for its regimen.A review of 11 RCTs [261] that compared intensive insulin treatment with conventional insulin treatment in people with T1DM found that intensive insulin treatment resulted in more frequent hy - poglycemia and greater weight gain.
However, most of these studies were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s, and intensive insulin treatment in those studies consisted of at least three daily injections of a combination of NPH and regular insulin. Balancing the benefits and risks Studies in the past have shown that hypoglycemia occurs more frequently in intensive insulin treatment compared to conven - tional insulin treatment.However, with the development of in - sulin analogs including rapid-acting and long-acting insulin analogs, the frequency of SH has been reduced by 1/2–1/3 com - pared to the DCCT study, even with intensive insulin therapy [262].A study conducted in Koreans with T1DM also showed a reduction in the frequency of hypoglycemia compared to a study conducted in the West 10 years ago [263].
Meanwhile, large-scale studies of DCCT and EDIC have shown that inten - sive insulin treatment with multiple insulin injections or insulin pumps leads to an improvement in HbA1c levels, a reduction in micro- and macrovascular complications, and a decrease in mortality. Therefore, it can be concluded that the benefits of in - tensive insulin treatment outweigh the risks.Alternatives and considerations Meta-analyses of studies that compared intensive insulin treat - ment involving multiple insulin injections and insulin pumps showed no significant difference in the frequency of SH.How - ever, the reduction in HbA1c levels was slightly better in the insulin pump group [264].At present, there are no consensus recommendations to guide the choice between multiple insulin injections or insulin pumps for specific individuals.Both are recommended as intensive insulin treatment for T1DM [255].
The use of insulin pump treatment is discussed in a separate section (section ‘Continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps’).Level of evidence The evidence considered for this analysis consisted of systematic reviews and meta-analyses [265-271], along with RCTs [272,273]. The evidence level was rated as randomized controlled studies, including systematic reviews and RCTs that were well-planned and conducted with moderate to high quality.The recommen - dation was classified as a general recommendation because the benefits outweighed the risks.Benefits The previous DCCT study comparing intensive insulin treatment versus conventional insulin treatment in people with T1DM re - ported a 2- to 3-fold increase in the incidence of SH requiring as - sistance from others in the intensive insulin treatment group.However, the study was conducted using intermediate-acting in - sulin and regular insulin [91].Several types of insulin analogs have since been developed.
These include rapid-acting insulin analogs such as aspart, lispro, and glulisine, as well as long-acting insulin analogs like glargine 100 U/mL and detemir. More recently, longer-acting basal analogs like degludec and glargine 300 U/mL, which have longer half-lives than glargine 100 U/mL and detemir, have been developed and are currently in use.In addition, new ultra-rapid-acting insulin analogs like niacinamide combined with aspart (Fiasp, Novo Nordisk, Bags - værd, Denmark) and prostacyclin analog- and citrate-contain - ing lispro (ultra-rapid lispro, Lyumjev, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) have been developed to accelerate their onset of action and are also being used.Long-acting insulin an - alogs have a longer duration of action compared to intermedi - ate-acting insulin (NPH) with a flatter, more constant and con - sistent plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic profiles.
Rapid-acting insulin analogs have a quicker onset and peak, and shorter duration of action compared to regular human in - sulin. In people with T1DM, the combination of rapid-acting insulin analogs and long-acting insulin analogs is associated with lower risk of nocturnal and postprandial hypoglycemia, lower HbA1c levels, and less weight gain compared with inter - mediate-acting insulin (NPH) and regular insulin [254,265- 268,270,272,273].In a 24-month RCT, the use of detemir+aspart was superior to NPH+aspart in reducing HbA1c levels and FPG, with added benefits of less major and nocturnal hypoglycemia and less weight gain [272].A systematic review and network meta-anal - ysis of a total of 39 studies, encompassing 27 RCTs, demon -Recommendation 9.6 In adults with T1DM on multiple daily in - sulin injection therapy, rapid-acting insulin analogs and basal insu - lin analogs should be used preferentially.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.588 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgstrated consistent results. This encompassed studies involving long-acting insulin analogs (glargine, detemir) and intermedi - ate-acting insulin (NPH, lente) adults with T1DM [265].A lit - erature review of 11 systematic reviews also confirmed that long- acting insulin analogs are superior to intermediate-acting insu - lin (NPH) in terms of HbA1c levels and incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia [266].In a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis, not only traditional long-acting insulin analogs (glargine, detemir), but also degludec, a longer-acting basal ana - log with a longer half-life, was found superior to intermediate- acting insulin in terms of HbA1c and FPG levels, weight gain, and major, severe, or nocturnal hypoglycemia [270].
Another systematic review and meta-analysis including nine RCTs con - ducted on people with T1DM found that detemir was superior to NPH for the risk of SH, but the results were inconsistent and there were no clear differences in other interventions, including severe nocturnal hypoglycemia and HbA1c levels [271]. A sys - tematic review and meta-analysis including 22 RCTs demon - strated the superiority of rapid-acting insulin analogs over regu - lar insulin in terms of overall hypoglycemia incidence, nocturnal hypoglycemia, SH, postprandial glycemic control, and HbA1c levels [267].In addition, a study conducted on individuals with either T1DM or T2DM, among whom 82 were T1DM, found that multiple daily insulin injection with glargine plus premeal glu - lisine was superior to twice-daily premixed insulin (Humalog mix 75/25, Eli Lilly and Company; or Novomix 70/30, Novo Nordisk) in terms of patient satisfaction and quality of life, gly - cemic variability, and HbA1c levels [274].
Risks The 24-month, multi-national RCT showed similar safety profiles between pre-prandial aspart+NPH and aspart+detemir, without unexpected adverse events reported in the aspart+detemir group [272]. A systematic review and network meta-analysis of studies of long-acting insulin analogs (glargine, detemir) and intermedi - ate-acting insulin (NPH, lente) in adults with T1DM found that although the cost-effectiveness varied by studies, long-acting in - sulin analogs were generally more costly than intermediate-act - ing insulin [265].However, a more recent systematic review found that long-acting insulin analogs, especially detemir, were cost-effective compared to NPH [269].
However, these reviews on cost-effectiveness did not include domestic data.Balancing the benefits and risks The combination of long-acting insulin analogs and rapid-act - ing insulin analogs demonstrated to reduce the incidence of hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia, improve glycemic indices of HbA1c, FPG, and postprandial glucose levels, and reduce the extent of weight gain, compared to intermediate- acting insulin (NPH, lente) and regular insulin. Meanwhile, there are no clear risks of using long-acting insulin analogs and rapid-acting insulin analogs over intermediate-acting insulin (NPH, lente) and regular insulin.Although few overseas cost- effectiveness analyses report long-acting insulin analogs (glargine, detemir) are more costly than intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) [265], the studies were not conducted in Korea, and recent findings show detemir as more cost-effective than NPH [269].
Therefore, the benefits of using long-acting insulin analogs and rapid-acting insulin analogs compared to inter - mediate-acting insulin (NPH, lente) and regular insulin clearly outweigh the risks. Alternatives and considerations In the EDITION 4 study conducted in the United States and Europe on individuals with T1DM, there was no significant dif - ference in the effectiveness of glargine 300 U/mL and glargine 100 U/mL when used as basal insulin.However, in the EDI - TION JP1 study involving Japanese individuals with T1DM, glargine 300 U/mL was found to be more effective in reducing the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia, compared to glargine 100 U/mL [275,276].In individuals with T1DM and at least one risk factor for hypoglycemia, degludec significantly decreased nocturnal hypoglycemia and symptomatic SH when compared to glargine 100 U/mL in the United States and Europe [277].
In addition, degludec allows for flexible dosing intervals ranging from 8 to 40 hours, providing comparable glycemic control to daily dosing at the same time [278]. A recent systematic review reported that degludec was cost-effective over a 1-year period compared to glargine [269].In a study conducted on people with T1DM, it was found that using Fiasp as pre-prandial insu - lin for 6 months resulted in a decrease of 0.15% in HbA1c levels and a reduction of 12 mg/dL in postprandial blood glucose lev - els as compared to aspart.The study also found that injection of Fiasp immediately after a meal had similar effects to pre-pran - dial aspart, all of which were maintained for up to 1 year [279,280].
More recently, ultra-rapid lispro was developed, which includes a prostacyclin analog and citrate in the rapid- acting insulin analog lispro to increase and accelerate absorp - 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea589 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgtion through increased local vasodilation and vascular permea - bility. Once administered 0 to 2 minutes before meals, it was re - ported to be more effective in controlling postprandial glycemic levels compared to lispro [281].Medications other than insulin The adjunctive role of non-insulin treatments in T1DM is be - ing actively studied.Medications other than insulin in T1DM are studied to evaluate their efficacy as adjunct to insulin ther - apy.In particular, as the prevalence of obesity in T1DM is in - creasing, new drugs are being developed to be used alongside insulin, to reduce weight and decrease insulin dose.
Pramlint - ide, a drug based on amylin secreted by pancreatic β-cells, has been approved by the U.S. FDA for use in T1DM, but is not currently imported into Korea.In randomized controlled stud - ies, pramlintide has been shown to reduce body weight by 1 to 2 kg and lower HbA1c levels by 0.0% to 0.3% when used in combination with insulin [282,283].Several drugs licensed only for T2DM have been studied in people with T1DM.Met - formin, when used in T1DM, reduced weight and improved cholesterol levels, but had no significant effect on HbA1c levels [284,285].Among GLP-1RAs, adding liraglutide or exenatide to insu - lin was associated with a 0.2% reduction in HbA1c levels and a weight loss of nearly 3 kg [286].Among SGLT2 inhibitors, the addition of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin re - duced body weight, HbA1c levels, and insulin dose when used with insulin compared to insulin alone, but increased the fre - quency of ketoacidosis [287-289].
Sotagliflozin, an SGLT1/2 inhibitor, also reduced body weight, HbA1c, and insulin dose in patients with T1DM when combined with insulin, but in - creased the incidence of ketoacidosis [290].

[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea591 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgRecommendation 10.2 Consider the presence of comorbidities (cardiac failure, ASCVD, and CKDs), hypoglycemic effects, effects on weight, risk of hypoglycemia, side effects, treatment acceptability, age, life value pursued by patients, and cost when selecting drugs. [Expert opinion, general recommendation] Level of evidence Recommendations are based on evidence from large RCTs, meta-analyses, and expert opinions.Benefits When choosing a glucose-lowering agent, the primary consid - erations are the presence of comorbidities (HF , ASCVD, and CKD), the glucose-lowering effect of the drug, the effect on weight, the risk of hypoglycemia, and adverse reactions.
Since the study on the cardiovascular benefits of empagliflozin was reported in 2015 [291-294], large-scale RCTs have been con - ducted to verify the cardiovascular safety of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs. The results showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were generally associated with fewer hospitalizations for HF , re - duced cardiovascular mortality, reduced albuminuria, delayed decline in eGFR, and ESRD progression.On the other hand, GLP-1RAs significantly reduced the occurrence of major car - diovascular events and composite renal endpoints.Based on these findings, it is recommended that individuals with diabe - tes with HF , ASCVD, and CKD should include medications that have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing the risk of developing and worsening these comorbidities.In terms of weight loss, metformin and α-glucosidase inhibi - tors have a mild effect on weight loss, while SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs (liraglutide, dulaglutide) have a moderate weight loss effect of 2% to 5%.
Among GLP-1RAs, semaglutide injection has a more substantial weight loss effect. DPP-4 in - hibitors are weight-neutral, while insulin and sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain.When weight control is consid - ered in obese individuals with T2DM, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs may be beneficial among antidiabetic medications.Among antidiabetic medications, GLP-1RAs and insulin have the most potent glucose-lowering effects.They are fol - lowed by metformin, sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors, and thi - azolidinediones, which also have high potency, whereas DPP-4 inhibitors have moderate glucose-lowering effects [295].In ad - dition, choosing medications considering various factors such as adverse reactions including hypoglycemia, compliance, age, the patient’s life values, and cost can minimize side effects.One of the most important but often overlooked aspects of drug selection is engaging in shared decision-making by pro - viding sufficient information to the patient.
Reports vary, but nearly half of patients with diabetes lack sufficient adherence to treatment plans, leading to suboptimal glycemic and cardio - vascular risk factor control and increased diabetic complica - tions, mortality, hospitalization, and healthcare costs [296- 300]. Factors that affect the individual’s adherence to treatment include perceived treatment inefficacy, fear of hypoglycemia, treatment complexity, adverse reactions, and cost [301], and have been reported to vary by medication type [302].It is nec - essary to put the patients at the center of their care and to iden - tify and acknowledge their comorbidities, preferences, and barriers to specific treatments [303,304].Risks In cases where agents deemed most medically beneficial are un - available due to patient preferences, the benefits of reducing the risk of major morbidity and mortality may have to be foregone.
Alternatives and considerations It is essential not to rationalize the choice of a less effective treat - ment simply because the patient declined the recommended medication. Instead, healthcare professionals should focus on educating patients about the medication they need, its antici - pated advantages, and how to reduce the expected side effects, with a comprehensive approach.Consistent communication can help change their preferences and improve health out - comes.Level of evidence One RCT and a meta-analysis of seven studies (including five in - tervention studies) were evaluated.Given the insufficient num - ber of studies, the level of evidence was determined as expert Recommendation 10.3 Initiate insulin therapy for patients with se - vere hyperglycemia (HbA1c >9.0%) along with hyperglycemic symptoms (polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, etc.).[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.592 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgopinion.
The recommendation was classified as a general recom - mendation because the benefits outweigh the risks [305,306]. Benefits Since insulin is a potent glucose-lowering agent, it may be the drug of choice for patients with severe hyperglycemia and symptoms such as polydipsia, polyuria, and weight loss [307].In a study comparing an insulin-administered group and an oral antidiabetic agent-administered group among 382 newly diag - nosed T2DM patients (average HbA1c 10.1%) over 2 weeks, the rate of reaching target blood glucose levels was higher when in - sulin was administered (insulin pump, MDI therapy, and oral antidiabetic agents: 97.1%, 95.2%, and 83.5%, respectively).In the insulin-administered group, β-cell function assessed by the homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) improved, and the remission rate over 1 year was also higher (insulin pump, MDI therapy, oral antidiabetic agents: 51.1%, 44.9%, 26.7% respectively) [305].
A meta-analysis of seven stud - ies that included 839 newly diagnosed T2DM patients receiving insulin for 2 to 3 weeks showed the same results. After insulin treatment, HOMA-β increased (1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.25), and the homeostasis model assessment of in - sulin resistance (HOMA-IR), a marker of insulin resistance, de - creased (–0.57; 95% CI, –0.84 to –0.29).Analyzing four studies from the meta-analysis that evaluated remission, the remission rates were maintained at 66.2% at 3 months, 46.3% at 1 year, and 42.1% at 2 years [306].Risks The adverse reactions of insulin include a high incidence of hy - poglycemia and weight gain, inconvenience due to injection, and the need for blood glucose monitoring.In RCTs, SH and serious adverse reactions were not observed.
Although mild hypoglycemia was more common in the insulin group than in the oral antidiabetic agent group, it was quickly recoverable (in - sulin pump, multiple insulin injection therapy, and oral antidia - betic agents: 31%, 28%, and 19%, respectively). Balancing the benefits and risks In cases of severe hyperglycemia accompanied by hyperglyce - mic symptoms, studies have demonstrated that insulin admin - istration is more effective in improving blood glucose levels and β-cell function and has a higher 1-year remission rate than oral antidiabetic agents, indicating that the benefits of insulin therapy outweigh the risks.Alternatives and considerations The initiation and titration of insulin therapy are summarized in Table 8 [308].For those using multiple daily insulin injec - tions, the total daily insulin requirements should be deter - mined based on the target blood glucose level, typically starting from 0.4 to 0.5 units/kg/day.
Half of this amount should be ad - ministered as basal insulin at a specific time, while the remain - ing portion should be divided into thirds and given as prandial insulin before each meal. It is of note that injections should not be given if there is no food intake.The starting dose and dose adjustments should be individualized, and SMBG levels and systematic training are necessary for proper self-management of blood glucose [309,310].Level of evidence The recommendation is based on large-scale RCTs and meta- analyses.Benefits In the UKPDS, a study on newly diagnosed T2DM, pharma - cotherapy along with aggressive lifestyle modification reduced the incidence of microvascular complications by 25% in the sulfonylurea or insulin treatment arms, and a 1.0% reduction of HbA1c reduced the incidence of microvascular complica - tions by 37% over the 10-year study period [96,98].
Further - more, a report published 10 years after the end of the study re - vealed that initial tight glycemic control not only reduces the risk of ongoing microvascular events but also has a legacy ef - fect of reducing myocardial infarction and total mortality [97]. Generally, pharmacologic treatment is initiated with a single oral antidiabetic agent.However, if glycemic targets are unlikely to be reached with monotherapy alone, initial combination therapy of two drugs with different mechanisms may be consid - ered [311,312].Since the glucose-lowering effect of a single oral antidiabetic agent is generally within 1.0% of HbA1c, combina - tion therapy is recommended when the HbA1c level is more than 1.5% above the target level.
Several RCTs and meta-analy - ses have shown that initial combination therapy with metfor - min and either DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, or sulfonyl - ureas/glinides showed a significant reduction in HbA1c (ap -Recommendation 10.4 When initiating drug therapy, a monother - apy or combination therapy should be used, taking into consider - ation the HbA1c goal and current glucose levels. [Randomized con - trolled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea593 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgproximately 0.4%) and sustained glycemic control compared to metformin monotherapy [108,311,313,314].Risks A variety of adverse drug reactions can occur and increase the burden of costs.Possible side effects include GI symptoms such as dyspepsia and nausea, hypoglycemia, weight gain or loss, urinary tract infections, and transient decreases in eGFR.
Balancing the benefits and risks Given that the benefits of preventing microvascular and mac - rovascular complications through glycemic control signifi - cantly surpass the risks of side effects or medication costs, vig - orous lifestyle modification and proper pharmacotherapy should be initiated right from the point of diagnosis. There are many antidiabetic agents currently available that have a low risk of hypoglycemia.Therefore, by using these agents, the risk of hypoglycemia, the major concern in initial combination therapy, can be minimized.Although studies on early combination therapy have not demonstrated a direct re - duction in complications, as the benefits of tight glycemic con - trol have been well documented in previous studies, early com - bination therapy may lead to a reduced risk of diabetic compli - cations.
While there is a lack of research on the most appropri - ate combination of antidiabetic agents, the benefits of initial combination therapy are still recognized. Level of evidence The recommendation is based on observational studies that observed the prognosis in recently diagnosed patients with T2DM who achieved an early HbA1c target and on RCTs and meta-analyses that investigated the effects of initial combina - tion therapy.Benefits A stepwise addition of antidiabetic agents to improve hypergly - cemia in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes increases the duration of exposure to hyperglycemia.In a 10-year observa - tional study of 34,737 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, there was an increase in microvascular and macrovascular complications in those with HbA1c ≥6.5% in the first year after diagnosis compared with those with HbA1c <6.5% (HbA1c 6.5% to <7.0%; hazard ratio [HR] for microvascular complica - tions 1.204; 95% CI, 1.063 to 1.365).
As mortality increases with HbA1c ≥7.0% (HbA1c 7.0% to <8.0%; HR, 1.290; 95% CI, 1.104 to 1.507), and microvascular complications and mor - tality increases with more prolonged exposure to hyperglyce - mia with HbA1c >8.0% [108], even if HbA1c is not as high at the time of diagnosis, aggressive glycemic control may reduce the risk of developing diabetic complications [97]. In a 6-year observational study of 194 Koreans with newly diagnosed T2DM, those who achieved target HbA1c levels early had a longer duration of maintained glycemic control (34.5%, 30.0%, and 16.1% in <3, 3–6, and ≥6 months, P=0.039) and fewer complications [315].The VERIFY study showed that the initial combination ther - apy prolonged the time to primary and secondary treatment failure compared to the conventional combination therapy, which involves sequential intensification of glucose-lowering agents [111].
In individuals who had been diagnosed with dia - betes within 2 years, had an HbA1c of 6.5% to 7.5%, and a BMI of 22 to 40 kg/m2, early combination therapy (vildagliptin and metformin, 998 patients), compared to metformin monothera - py (1,003 patients), reduced the time to initial treatment failure (HbA1c >7.0% for 6 months) over 5 years (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.58; P<0.0001) [316]. The VERIFY study showed that this effect was consistent regardless of age, BMI, HbA1c, gen - der, or race, and there were no differences in adverse events, safety, or incidence of hypoglycemia between the groups.
A meta-analysis of 15 RCTs involving 6,693 treatment-naïve patients with T2DM (mean age 48.4 to 62.7 years, mean HbA1c 7.2% to 9.9%, mean diabetes duration 1.6 to 4.1 years, mean treatment duration 6 months, total observation 16 to 72 weeks) showed that initial combination therapy including metformin (with thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas) was more effective in reducing HbA1c levels (–0.43%; 95% CI, –0.56 to –0.30) and achieving the HbA1c goal of <7.0% (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.48) than metformin monotherapy [312]. In another meta-analysis of four RCTs in - volving 3,749 treatment-naïve patients with T2DM, initial combination therapy of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors re - duced HbA1c by 0.55% (95% CI, –0.37 to –0.43) and weight by 2.0 kg (95% CI, –2.34 to –1.66) compared to metformin mono - therapy.
Compared to SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy, the com - bination therapy reduced HbA1c by 0.59% (95% CI, –0.72 to –0.46) and weight by 0.57 kg (95% CI, –0.89 to –0.25) [317].Recommendation 10.5 Consider combination therapy from the day of diagnosis to reduce the risk of glycemic control failure. [Ran - domized controlled trial, limited recommendation] Moon JS, et al.594 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgIn terms of preservation of β-cell function, a meta-analysis including 360 RCTs (total 157,696 participants, mean treat - ment duration 24 weeks, mean age 56.2 years, mean diabetes duration 6.6 years, mean HbA1c 8.1%) found that in compari - son to six other oral glucose-lowering agents, incretin therapy (DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1RAs) increased HOMA-β, fasting C- peptide, and decreased fasting glucose and HOMA-IR com - pared to placebo [318].
Therefore, initial combination therapy for aggressive glyce - mic control at the onset of diagnosis, as opposed to the sequen - tial addition of antidiabetic medication, may likely improve the long-term prognosis in a subset of T2DM patients. Risks Risks to consider when using initial combination therapy over monotherapy include adverse reactions, costs, weight gain, hy - poglycemic events, and decreased adherence.In the VERIFY study, the risk of adverse events, weight gain, and hypoglycemic events did not differ from metformin monotherapy.Although the risk of hypoglycemia increased in all metformin-containing dual-combination therapies (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.26), the risk of hypoglycemia was not increased compared to met - formin monotherapy (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.56) except for sulfonylureas [312].
In comparison to metformin mono - therapy, initial combination therapies with DPP-4 inhibitors+ metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors+metformin were associated with similar risks of hypoglycemia, but sulfonylurea+metformin (HR, 8.91; 95% CI, 1.46 to 54.34) and thiazolidinedione+met- formin (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.46) were associated with higher risks of hypoglycemia [311]. Regarding weight gain, ini - tial combination of metformin+sulfonylurea and metformin+ thiazolidinedione resulted in a weight gain of 2.6 kg (95% CI, 2.40 to 2.80; P<0.001) and 1.93 kg (95% CI, 1.88 to 1.97; P<0.001) respectively, compared to metformin monotherapy [311].
Balancing the benefits and risks Specific individuals, specifically those who have been diagnosed with diabetes for less than 5 years, are under the age of 70, have an HbA1c below 7.5%, have a BMI over 22 kg/m2, and have no CVDs or diabetic complications while having a low risk of hy - poglycemia, early combination therapy using different mecha - nisms of oral antidiabetic agents to control blood glucose levels appears to increase the possibility of preserving β-cell function and reduce the risk of treatment failure in patients with T2DM.
Understanding that diabetes is a progressive chronic disease and that it is very difficult to maintain HbA1c below 6.5% over the long term with monotherapy, an early combination therapy based on metformin is expected to quickly achieve target blood glucose levels, thereby providing more extended protection from treatment failure, alleviating glucose toxicity immediately after the diagnosis of diabetes, and helping improve β-cell func - tion and insulin resistance. However, most studies supporting the benefits of initial combination therapy do not have long fol - low-up periods and only focus on glycemic control, including HbA1c, as an endpoint.There are no RCTs to determine how long these early glycemic improvements last and whether they lead to long-term benefits, such as reduced microvascular com - plications or cardiovascular risks.
Meanwhile, it is also unclear whether the benefits observed in the VERIFY study, which had the longest follow-up period, resulted from initially effective glycemic control or the specific drug. Alternatives and considerations Recent clinical results suggest that DPP-4 inhibitors may be preferred for long-term use in initial combination with met - formin because of their glucose-lowering effects, lower risk of treatment failure, and less risk of discontinuation due to weight gain, hypoglycemia, GI side effects, or infection.However, fur - ther studies are warranted on various combination therapies based on metformin, such as sulfonylureas, α-glucosidase in - hibitors, thiazolidinediones, GLP-1RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors for initial combination therapy.The increase in healthcare costs (drug costs) compared to conventional sequential add-on therapies may be offset by a reduction in diabetic complications and healthcare costs due to treatment failure [319].
In addition, recent advances in us - ing fixed-dose combinations may improve medication adher - ence. The Committee of Clinical Practice Guidelines of the KDA conducted a brief survey to determine patient preferenc - es for initial combination therapy.A group of 28 recently diag - nosed, treatment-naïve patients with T2DM with HbA1c levels less than 7.0% were asked, “Would you try the initial combina - tion therapy to possibly delay the start of insulin treatment and help maintain the target HbA1c levels longer, even if you are likely to reach glycemic targets with the conventional single metformin therapy?” Out of the 28 participants, 25 agreed, while among the three who disagreed, one cited family opposi - tion, and the other two cited the fear of experiencing hypogly - cemia-like symptoms.
2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea595 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgLevel of evidence We included meta-analyses and RCTs that evaluated medica - tion adherence and glycemic control in patients with T2DM. Benefits A study on individuals with T2DM revealed that medication adherence was significantly linked to improved glycemic con - trol, showing a 0.16% decrease in HbA1c levels for every 10% increase in adherence [320].These findings were consistent with another study that analyzed the correlation between med - ication adherence and clinical outcomes through pharmacy claims data [321].Patients with poor adherence had statistical - ly and clinically worse outcomes, and a 10% increase in non- adherence to metformin was associated with a 0.14% increase in HbA1c levels [321].
Besides improving glycemic control, en - hanced medication adherence can also result in reduced num - bers of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and healthcare costs [322]. A meta-analysis conducted to evaluate medication adher - ence for six chronic diseases reported a 17% non-adherence rate (95% CI, 15% to 20%) overall, with the highest non-adher - ence rate in osteoporosis and hyperlipidemia at 25% and the lowest non-adherence rate in diabetes at 10%.Y ounger age, number of concurrent medications, prescriber specialty, and high medication costs were identified as factors associated with lower adherence [323].In another study, age, race, medi - cation costs, health insurance coverage, insulin use, and health literacy were identified as factors influencing medication ad - herence [322].
In older adults aged 60 years and older, increas - ing age was associated with better adherence, but female gen - der (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.97), depression (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.87), and high copayments for medication (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.94) were analyzed as factors that low - ered adherence [324]. In a study on adherence by the class of antidiabetic medica - tion, better adherence was observed in the following order: DPP-4 inhibitors > thiazolidinediones ≥ sulfonylureas > met - formin [302].In addition, the most significant factor in im - proving adherence was identified as an adequate response to adverse drug reactions [325].
While some studies demonstrate that improved education and mobile-based interventions can enhance adherence [326], a meta-analysis of various interven - tions, including messaging interventions such as text messag - ing services, web-based feedback, and monitoring devices, and monitoring interventions such as remote self-reporting of medication adherence and telephone calls from healthcare providers, showed inconsistent results [327]. Out of 15 inter - ventions, six improved medication adherence, and two led to improved clinical outcomes [327].It is crucial to assess medication adherence during every vis - it, particularly in cases with poorly-controlled blood glucose levels.When initiating a medication, discuss the expected effi - cacy, side effects, administration methods, and costs with the patient.Identifying and managing barriers to adherence can enhance compliance with the prescribed therapy.
Improving adherence can help improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of diabetic complications. It can also reduce side effects and lower costs by preventing the addition of unnecessary medications and improve the collaborative relationship be - tween patients with diabetes and healthcare professionals.Risks There is no particular risk involved, apart from the extra time and effort required by healthcare providers to assess medica - tion adherence.Alternatives and considerations To improve adherence to medications, reducing the number of tablets and unifying the dosing times for convenience is help - ful.Additionally, it is important to listen carefully to the pa - tient’s reported adverse events and, if the medication is indis - pensable, repeatedly explain to the patient the importance and effectiveness of the medication.If possible, switching to an al - ternative medication should be considered to minimize side effects.
If the patient repeatedly forgets to take their medica - tion, consider interventions like using a weekly pillbox or set - ting alarms. Level of evidence Recommendations are based on evidence from large RCTs, me - ta-analyses, and expert opinion.Recommendation 10.7 If the HbA1c goal is not achieved, the pre - vious drug should be increased in dose or used in combination with a drug of a different class immediately.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation]Recommendation 10.6 During pharmacotherapy, check medica - tion adherence regularly and adjust the medication if necessary.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.596 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgBenefits Numerous studies have demonstrated the additional glucose- lowering effect of treatment intensification with dual-combi - nation therapy compared to metformin monotherapy.
In a meta-analysis, adding another class of glucose-lowering agent apart from insulin to metformin resulted in an additional 0.7% to 1.0% reduction in HbA1c [328]. The usefulness of low-dose initial combination therapy with dual drugs has been well re - ported, as most drugs have a maximal glucose-lowering effect with fewer adverse effects at around 50% of the maximum dose [313].Therefore, if monotherapy fails to achieve individualized treatment goals, combination therapy with other oral agents can be initiated before increasing the drug to the maximum dose.Unless there are contraindications or adverse drug reac - tions, dual-combination therapy should first be initiated with metformin, and if the glycemic target is still not achieved, tri - ple-combination therapy should be initiated by adding agents with different mechanisms of action [329-331].
A combination of different classes of drugs that have been well documented for their effectiveness in glycemic control can be used to achieve maximum glycemic control while mini - mizing the side effects. Furthermore, incorporating drugs that consider individual-specific factors can yield benefits beyond glycemic control.For instance, in patients with comorbidities like ASCVD, CKD, or HF , SGLT2 inhibitors may offer addi - tional advantages, including the prevention of ASCVD, reduc - tion in the decline of kidney function, and decreased hospital - izations due to HF .Risks Adverse reactions, including hypoglycemia, weight gain or loss, polyuria, urinary tract infections, and higher costs, may arise depending on the medications added.Balancing the benefits and risks Given the importance of glycemic control in diabetes and the established additional glucose-lowering effects of combination therapy, the benefits of combination therapy far outweigh the risks.
Therefore, if monotherapy does not achieve glycemic control targets, it is crucial to advance to dual-combination therapy promptly. If dual therapy fails to achieve adequate gly - cemic control, progressing to triple-combination therapy and other assertive treatments should be considered.If the individ - ualized glycemic targets are unmet, healthcare providers should adjust medication immediately.Healthcare providers should avoid clinical inertia, which is the practice of maintaining prior treatment instead of initiating or intensifying treatment.Alternatives and considerations When treating T2DM with a single oral antidiabetic agent, the dose should be adjusted every 2 to 3 months based on HbA1c measurements.Although there are slight variations by drug classes, a usual reduction in HbA1c levels with a single agent is 0.5% to 1%.Once HbA1c goals are achieved, the dose can be maintained or even reduced in some cases.
If the HbA1c is ≥7.5% upon diagnosis or glycemic goals are not met within 3 months of the maximum monotherapy dose, combination ther - apy should be initiated without delay. When choosing additional medications, consider the mechanism of action of the drug, its glucose-lowering potency, adverse reactions, risk of hypoglyce - mia, impact on weight, cardiovascular benefits, patient compli - ance, and cost [332].Metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors have weight loss or maintenance effects, while sulfo - nylureas and thiazolidinediones have weight gain effects, and hypoglycemia is most common with sulfonylureas [328,333].If postprandial hyperglycemia is the major concern, adding a meg - litinide, α-glucosidase inhibitor, or DPP-4 inhibitor may be con - sidered [334].As diabetes progresses, insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction advance, and a significant proportion of pa - tients will require insulin therapy as the duration of diabetes ex - tends.
Level of evidence The recommendation is based on RCTs and meta-analyses of RCTs analyzing treatment with metformin in patients with T2DM. Benefits The UKPDS study found that metformin monotherapy had similar glucose-lowering effects but caused less weight gain and hypoglycemia compared to sulfonylureas or insulin monother - apy in overweight individuals with T2DM [95].Subsequent observational studies and meta-analyses support metformin as the first-line therapy of choice in terms of HbA1c reduction, adverse reactions, weight gain, hypoglycemic events, cost, and long-term cardiovascular events compared to sulfonylureas, Recommendation 10.8 Use metformin first for pharmacotherapy and maintain it unless there are contraindications or side effects.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea597 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgthiazolidinediones, and DPP-4 inhibitors [328,335,336].
The Practical Evidences of Antidiabetic Monotherapy (PEAM) study, a domestic RCT in Korea, examined the glucose-lower - ing effects of monotherapy in 349 patients with newly diagnosed drug-naïve T2DM. After 48 weeks of treatment with sulfonyl - ureas (glimepiride), biguanides (metformin), or thiazolidine - diones (rosiglitazone) monotherapy, there was no significant difference in HbA1c reduction between the drugs (glimepiride, 7.8%→6.9%, P<0.001; metformin, 7.9%→7.0%, P<0.001; rosigli - tazone, 7.8%→7.0%, P<0.001; P for trend=0.62) [337].Based on such findings, clinical guidelines from various or - ganizations, including the KDA, the ADA, the European Asso - ciation for the Study of Diabetes, and the IDF , recommend metformin as the first-line antidiabetic agent when lifestyle modifications alone do not achieve target blood glucose levels [336,338].Metformin has a potent glucose-lowering effect, does not cause weight gain, has a low risk of hypoglycemia, and is inexpensive.
Although no studies have included cardio - vascular events as an endpoint, the UKPDS study showed the potential to reduce myocardial infarction and mortality, and a recently published meta-analysis reported a reduction in car - diovascular risk and mortality [339]. Risks Adverse reactions of metformin include GI intolerance due to diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting, and should be titrated from low doses while monitored for adverse effects.Although rare, lactic acidosis can occur, hence it should not be used in cases of severe hepatic or renal impairment (use cautiously if the eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and contraindicated if less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), acute condi - tions that can affect kidney function, such as severe infections, dehydration, acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, or during cardiopulmonary failure [340].
It may be used in patients with stable HF with normal kidney function but should be avoided in patients hospitalized for HF or with uncontrolled HF . Long- term use of metformin may cause vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to anemia and peripheral neuropathy [341,342].During examinations involving iodinated radiocontrast, kidney function may decrease, and there have been reports of lactic acidosis in individuals taking metformin.As metformin is eliminated through the kidneys, it is usually contraindicated or temporarily discontinued in individuals with renal dysfunc - tion due to the risk of lactic acidosis.However, clinical cases of lactic acidosis are extremely rare, and the U.S.FDA has recent -ly revised its guidance, allowing its relatively safe use of met - formin in patients with diabetes whose eGFR is greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [343].When using iodinated con - trast agents, if the eGFR is less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, it is advisable to discontinue metformin.
After 48 hours post-ex - amination, kidney function should be re-evaluated before re - suming its use. Balancing the benefits and risks In RCTs and meta-analyses, metformin has shown excellent glucose-lowering effects and significantly reduced diabetes-re - lated endpoints, diabetes-related deaths, and total mortality [344].Additionally, it was associated with a lower risk of weight gain and hypoglycemia, and it is a cost-effective medi - cation.GI side effects can commonly occur during metformin therapy, but they can be minimized by gradually increasing the dose from a low level.The risk of a serious adverse reaction, lactic acidosis, is very low in the absence of other deteriorating factors such as renal impairment.Hence, the therapeutic bene - fits greatly outweigh the risks.Alternatives and considerations The extended-release form of metformin can help reduce GI side effects compared to the immediate-release form.
If met - formin cannot be used due to GI side effects or severe hepatic or renal impairment, other antidiabetic agents, such as DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and sulfonyl - ureas, etc., may be used as the initial therapy, depending on the patient’s condition [345]. Level of evidence The comparison of the glucose-lowering effects between oral antidiabetic agents and injectables for diabetes was based on a systematic review and network meta-analysis [346].The analy - sis included 453 RCTs assessing 21 antidiabetic interventions from nine drug classes (metformin, sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1RAs, SGLT2 inhibitors, basal insulin, basal-plus insulin, basal-bolus insulin, premixed insulin, α-glucosidase inhibitors, and meglitinide) with outcomes on blood glucose level, mortality, and cardiovascular events.
The intervention period was at least 24 weeks, assessing changes in Recommendation 10.9 When prioritizing a potent glucose-lower - ing effect, treatment should incorporate injectable therapies. [Ran - domized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.598 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgHbA1c and mortality rates among the drugs.Benefits A pairwise meta-analysis compared HbA1c changes between each drug versus placebo as an add-on to metformin [346].For glucose-lowering injectables, the mean difference (MD) for subcutaneous semaglutide was –1.33 (95% CI, –1.50 to –1.16), premixed insulin –0.89 (95% CI, –1.08 to –0.71), dulaglutide –0.89 (95% CI, –1.05 to –0.73), basal-bolus insulin –0.89 (95% CI, –1.17 to –0.60), liraglutide –0.80 (95% CI, –0.89 to –0.70), basal insulin –0.71 (95% CI, –0.82 to –0.60), prandial insulin –0.67 (95% CI, –0.86 to –0.47), exenatide –0.6 (95% CI, –0.73 to –0.47), and lixisenatide –0.43 (95% CI, –0.57 to –0.29).
For oral antidiabetic agents, the MD for meglitinide was –0.64 (95% CI, –0.85 to –0.43), pioglitazone –0.60 (95% CI, –0.71 to –0.50), ertugliflozin –0.58 (95% CI, –0.79 to –0.36), sulfonyl - ureas –0.57 (95% CI, –0.66 to –0.48), empagliflozin –0.57 (95% CI, –0.71 to –0.42), DPP-4 inhibitors –0.53 (95% CI, –0.58 to –0.47), dapagliflozin –0.51 (95% CI, –0.63 to –0.40), and a α-glucosidase inhibitors –0.50 (95% CI, –0.67 to –0.34). These results showed that GLP-1RAs, premixed insulin, and basal-bolus insulin had the most significant reductions in HbA1c level compared to placebo as an add-on to metformin, with subcutaneous semaglutide having the most potent effect.Risks 1) Hypoglycemia In a combination therapy with metformin, hypoglycemia was significantly higher with sulfonylureas, premixed insulin, and basal-bolus insulin compared to placebo.
In comparison be - tween GLP-1RAs and basal insulin, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia was significantly higher with basal insulin. 2) Weight gain Among injectables, insulin was associated with weight gain, while GLP-1RAs were associated with weight loss.3) Other side effects and safety GI side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and consti - pation are the most common side effects of GLP-1RAs, while injection site reactions are also reported.Regarding safety con - cerns with GLP-1RAs, large clinical studies have shown in - creased gallbladder disease but no significant difference in medullary thyroid cancer, pancreatitis, or pancreatic cancer.
Diabetic retinopathy outcomes were similar across most anti - diabetic agents compared to placebo; however, they were re - ported to be slightly higher with subcutaneously administered semaglutide (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.78), especially in cas - es where there was a rapid improvement in blood glucose lev - els. This phenomenon, which can occur with aggressive glyce - mic control, was also observed during insulin treatment in the DCCT.Therefore, additional clinical studies are needed re - garding the incidence and safety of diabetic retinopathy.4) Inconvenience of injections and injection site side effects According to a survey of Korean healthcare professionals on their perceptions and prescriptions for injectables, including insulin, patients often avoid injectable treatment due to fear of needles, pain, and the inconvenience of the method.
While in - sulin may require monitoring blood glucose levels and corre - sponding dose adjustments, GLP-1RAs have the advantage of not requiring dose adjustment based on blood glucose. Injec - tion site side effects are possible but not common.In addition, with basal insulin available as once-daily injection and GLP- 1RAs as once-weekly injections, minimizing injection fre - quency can enhance patient and healthcare provider percep - tions and increase the accessibility of injectables.5) Costs Insulin analogs and GLP-1RAs are more expensive than oral antidiabetic agents.GLP-1RAs, in particular, have very limited reimbursement criteria in Korea and are not in line with cur - rent clinical practice.
While the use of combination therapy of metformin and sulfonylureas has decreased significantly in re - cent clinical practice, reimbursement coverage for GLP-1RAs is only available when target blood glucose levels are not achieved despite the combination therapy of metformin and sulfonyl - ureas. This further limits the use of GLP-1RAs in terms of med - ical costs.Balancing the benefits and risks When considering aggressive glucose-lowering effects, inject - ables are preferred as long-acting GLP-1RAs and insulin gen - erally have more potent glucose-lowering effects than oral an - tidiabetic agents.However, injectables commonly require dis - cussions with patients regarding the inconvenience or aversion to injections and cost aspects.
In conclusion, when prioritizing potent glucose-lowering effects, the recommendation to prefer treatments including injectables, was made as a general recom - 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea599 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgmendation, considering the balance of benefits and risks and the target population. Alternatives and considerations If monotherapy or dual-combination therapy fails to achieve the target HbA1c levels, a combination of three or more oral antidiabetic agents may be considered.However, the adverse reactions of each medication and the medical costs associated with the increased number of medications should also be con - sidered.In many cases, insulin eventually becomes necessary.In such cases, combining therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors or once-weekly long-acting GLP-1RAs, in addition to metformin, can reduce the required dose of insulin or mitigate weight gain.
However, if intensive glycemic control is required, multiple daily insulin injections should be considered. Level of evidence This recommendation is based on a meta-analysis that con - ducted a head-to-head comparison between combination therapies based on incretins (short- and long-acting GLP- 1RAs, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP]/ GLP-1RAs such as tirzepatide) and those based on basal insu - lin in patients with T2DM [347].Benefits The analysis included patients who were around 60 years old on average, slightly more likely to be male, had been diabetic for an average of 9 years, and had an average HbA1c of 8.0% to 8.5%.Compared to basal insulin-based combination therapy, incre - tin-based combination therapy further reduced HbA1c by an average of 0.50% (95% CI, –0.53% to –0.46%).
In comparing the average reduction of HbA1c levels by incretin subgroups, while the combination therapy based on short-acting GLP- 1RAs showed no significant difference compared to basal insu - lin (0.01%; 95% CI, −0.13% to 0.12%), the combination therapy based on long-acting GLP-1RAs was significantly more effec - tive by 0.27% (95% CI, 0.12% to 0.42%). Although not yet avail - able in South Korea, tirzepatide, a GIP/GLP-1RA, showed the most potent effect of 0.90% (95% CI, –1.06% to –0.75%).Risks 1) Hypoglycemia Compared to basal insulin-based combinations, incretin-based combinations resulted in a 50% lower incidence of hypoglyce - mia.2) Weight gain Overall, weight was reduced with incretin-based combinations and increased with basal insulin-based combinations.
There was a significant weight loss of 4.6 kg (–4.7 to –4.5) with com - bination therapy based on short- and long-acting GLP-1RAs compared with insulin-based combination, with no difference in the weight loss between short- and long-acting GLP-1RAs. GIP/GLP-1RA-based combination therapy resulted in a weight loss of 12.0 kg (–13.9 to –10.1) compared with basal in - sulin-based combination therapy.3) Gastrointestinal adverse reactions and drug discontinuation rates Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occurred 6, 3–4, and 2–3 times more frequently with incretin-based combinations compared to basal insulin-based combinations.Drug discontinuation rates were 60% to 71% higher with incretin-based combina - tions than basal insulin-based combinations.4) Number of injections Compared to once-daily basal insulin administration, long- acting GLP-1RAs require once daily or weekly administration.Therefore, weekly GLP-1RAs offer the advantage of reducing resistance due to injection frequency.
Balancing the benefits and risks Compared to basal insulin-based combination therapy, incre - tin-based combination therapy has the advantage of better HbA1c reduction, significantly lower risk of hypoglycemia, and less frequent injections, especially among long-acting GLP-1RAs. However, combination therapy based on GLP- 1RAs has a significantly higher incidence of GI side effects.Therefore, when the potent glucose-lowering effect is a pri - ority, incorporating injectable agents, particularly based on GLP-1RAs rather than basal insulin, may be prioritized.How - ever, due to GI side effects, selecting appropriate injectable agents should be tailored to the individual circumstances.In conclusion, when considering injectable-based combina - tion therapy, prioritizing GLP-1RAs over basal insulin is deter -Recommendation 10.9-1) When considering combination therapy based on injectables, GLP-1RAs are prioritized over basal insulin.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.600 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgmined as a general recommendation based on a comprehen - sive assessment of the balance between glucose-lowering ben - efits and adverse reactions, as well as the target population for application. Various alternatives and considerations GI side effects are common with GLP-1RAs and may lead to medication discontinuation.Therefore, it is crucial to educate individuals on gradually increasing the dose.GLP-1RAs should be discontinued if side effects occur, and insulin should be considered.If insulin secretory function is impaired, the ef - fectiveness of GLP-1RAs may be limited, and prompt adminis - tration of insulin should be considered.
Level of evidence The glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1RA monotherapy com - pared to the combination therapy of GLP-1RA and basal insu - lin (either as separate drugs or as a fixed-ratio combination) was assessed through six RCTs with a study duration of at least 24 weeks [348-353]. In addition, the glucose-lowering effect of basal insulin monotherapy compared to combination therapy of GLP-1RA with basal insulin (either as separate drugs or as a fixed-ratio combination) was also evaluated through 14 RCTs with a study duration of at least 24 weeks [350,352,354-365].GLP-1RAs were evaluated only for four formulations: exena - tide twice-daily injection, liraglutide, dulaglutide, and subcuta - neous semaglutide.The fixed-ratio combinations of GLP-1RAs and basal insulin were evaluated for two formulations: insulin glargine/lixisenatide and insulin degludec/liraglutide.The level of evidence was classified as a RCT, as it originates from RCTs.
Benefits Previous RCTs on the efficacy of glycemic control of GLP-1RA+ basal insulin compared to GLP-1RA monotherapy (0.4% to 1.0% reduction in HbA1c), and we also reviewed 14 RCTs on the efficacy of glycemic control of GLP-1RA+basal insulin com - pared to basal insulin monotherapy. There was a significant re - duction in blood glucose levels with the combination therapy compared to monotherapy.Risks Compared with GLP-1RA monotherapy, GLP-1RA+basal in - sulin was associated with more frequent hypoglycemia and in - creased body weight.This trend was also observed in fixed-ra - tio combinations.The same trends were noted for hypoglyce - mia when comparing GLP-1RA+basal insulin with basal insu - lin monotherapy.Other risks of GLP-1RAs and insulin as indi - vidual agents are the same as those described in Recommenda - tion 9-1.
Balancing the benefits and risks If the target blood glucose level is not achieved despite being on treatment that includes one injectable medication, inject - ables from different classes can be combined. If the patient is on a GLP-1RA, adding basal insulin is feasible, and vice versa .Combining a GLP-1RA with basal insulin may have a greater glucose-lowering effect than each agent alone, reduce insulin requirements, and reduce the side effects of hypoglycemia and weight gain.In addition, the number of injections and blood glucose monitoring can be reduced compared to multiple in - sulin injections, and using fixed-ratio combinations of basal insulin and GLP-1RA can further improve medication adher - ence.However, its effectiveness may be limited in patients with a long history of diabetes or reduced insulin secretory function who require additional prandial insulin.
In addition, both drugs are expensive compared to oral antidiabetic agents, and the reimbursement criteria for their combined use in Korea is very restricted compared to multiple daily insulin or premixed insulin injections, presenting an economic burden. In conclusion, when the target blood glucose level cannot be achieved by either GLP-1RAs or basal insulin alone, the rec - ommendation to combine these two medications was deter - mined to be a limited recommendation, based on a compre - hensive assessment of the benefits and risks, as well as the tar - get population.Alternatives and considerations Apart from combining the two agents, increasing the number of premixed insulin injections or using multiple daily insulin injections could be alternatives.Recommendation 10.9-2) If the target blood glucose level is not achieved with either GLP-1RA or basal insulin alone, combine the two drugs.
[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] Recommendation 10.9-3) If the target blood glucose level is not achieved using GLP-1RA or basal insulin treatment, initiate intensive insulin therapy. [Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea601 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgLevel of evidence The level of evidence was classified as a RCT, as it originates from RCTs and meta-analyses.The recommendation was rated as limited, as the benefits do not apply in all cases.Benefits For those who do not achieve target glycemic levels with GLP- 1RA or basal insulin injections, a change in regimen to basal- plus insulin, premixed insulin, or MDI therapy (basal-bolus insulin) is necessary to improve glycemic control [366-368].
In patients with T2DM with HbA1c >7.5% on basal insulin, add - ing a single prandial insulin to the largest meal of the day re - sulted in a significant difference in the proportion of patients reaching HbA1c <7% after 3 months (22.4% vs. 8.8%, P<0.05) compared to the maintenance treatment arm, and a greater re - duction in HbA1c (–0.37% vs.–0.11%, P=0.03) [366].A meta- analysis of 10 prospective RCTs comparing basal insulin with twice-daily premixed insulin in 4,366 patients with T2DM also reported a higher achievement rate of target HbA1c levels in the premixed insulin group than in the basal insulin group [369].If once-daily prandial insulin with maintaining basal insulin (basal-plus insulin) achieves postprandial glucose control but not HbA1c targets, add a second prandial insulin.If the HbA1c target is still not achieved, switch to multiple daily in - sulin injections (basal-bolus insulin).
In a RCT conducted over 14 weeks with 631 patients with T2DM who had HbA1c levels above 8%, participants were divided into groups receiving 1, 2, or 3 times of prandial insulin. The group receiving three injec - tions had a higher percentage of reaching glycemic control tar - gets (30%, 33%, and 46%, respectively) [370].A meta-analysis of RCTs comparing GLP-1RA plus prandial or basal insulin therapy with basal-plus insulin/basal-bolus in - sulin therapy, as well as a RCT comparing GLP-1RA plus basal insulin combination therapy arm with the maintenance arm in patients with T2DM treated with MDIs of insulin, showed no difference in glucose-lowering effects between the two groups.However, the combination of GLP-1RAs and insulin was re - ported to be effective in weight loss and reducing the occurrence of hypoglycemia.However, due to the limited number of studies and lack of evidence, further research is needed [371,372].
Risks Compared to GLP-1RA or basal insulin injection therapy, in - tensive insulin therapy increases the number of injections, the risk of hypoglycemia, and weight gain. Premixed insulin and multiple daily insulin injection groups, compared to the basal insulin injection group, showed no difference or an improve - ment in the reduction of HbA1c levels depending on the study duration.However, they experienced more hypoglycemia and weight gain [369,373,374].Balancing the benefits and risks Switching to intensive insulin therapy is effective as it improves glycemic control indices, but depending on the injection regi - men, it increases the number of injections, the frequency of hypoglycemia, and weight gain.Patients undergoing intensive insulin therapy require an individualized selection of injection regimens and dose adjustments according to their glycemic status, age, and comorbidities, which is in line with Recom - mendation 2 [375,376].
In conclusion, the recommendation for insulin intensification for glycemic control was determined to be a limited recommendation based on a comprehensive as - sessment of the benefits and risks, as well as the target popula - tion. Level of evidence This recommendation is based on large-scale RCTs that investi - gated the cardiovascular safety of SGLT2 inhibitors (empa - gliflozin, dapagliflozin, ertugliflozin, canagliflozin) in patients with T2DM who have CVDs or cardiovascular risk factors, and on the meta-analyses of these studies.Additionally, large-scale RCTs on the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin) in patients with HF , regardless of diabetes status, were evaluated.Benefits In patients with T2DM with established CVD or cardiovascular risk, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, ertugliflozin, and cana - gliflozin significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for HF by approximately 30%.
The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Out - come Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Remov - ing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial assessing the cardiovascular safety of empagliflozin showed a 14% signif -Recommendation 10.10 In patients with HF , SGLT2 inhibitors, which have proven benefits in protecting against HF , should be a pri - ority regardless of HbA1c levels and should continue as long as there are no contraindications or adverse reactions. [Randomized con - trolled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.602 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgicant reduction in major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke), a 38% reduction in cardiovascular death and a 35% reduction in HF hospitalization compared to placebo [291].
The cardiovascular safety study of dapagliflozin, Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardio - vascular Events-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE-TIMI 58), reported a 27% lower incidence of hos - pitalization due to HF over an average study period of 4.2 years (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.88) [292], while the Evaluation of Ertugliflozin Efficacy and Safety Cardiovascular Outcomes Tri - al (VERTIS-CV) on the cardiovascular safety of ertugliflozin also showed a 30% reduction in hospitalization for HF (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.90) [377]. In the Canagliflozin Cardio - vascular Assessment Study (CANV AS) program, canagliflozin also reduced the risk of death and hospitalization due to HF (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.89) and decreased the risk of hos - pitalization due to HF by 32% (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.87) [378].The beneficial effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the worsen - ing of HF was observed regardless of the baseline ejection frac - tion (EF) status [379,380].
These benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on HF have been extended to studies on HF patients regardless of the presence of diabetes. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) study, involving 4,744 patients with existing HF (New Y ork Heart Association class II, III, or IV) and reduced EF (≤40%), regardless of diabetes status, found that dapagliflozin 10 mg reduced the risk of worsening HF or car - diovascular death by 26% over an average of 18.2-month study period (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.85; P<0.001), with similar outcomes in groups with or without diabetes [381].
Through the Empagliflozin outcome trial in patients with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (EMPEROR-Reduced) trial, empa - gliflozin was shown to reduce the composite endpoint of cardio - vascular death or hospitalization due to worsening HF by 25% compared to the placebo group (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.86; P<0.001) over an average study period of 16 months in patients with HF (class II, III, or IV and EF ≤40%), regardless of the presence of diabetes [381]. The effects of empagliflozin were maintained irrespective of diabetes status.
Meta-analysis of the DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced studies also showed that SGLT2 inhibitor treatment reduced all-cause mortality by 13% (pooled HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.98; P=0.018), cardiovascu - lar death by 14% (0.86; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.98; P=0.027), and the risk of worsening HF or cardiovascular death by 26% (0.74; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.82; P<0.0001) [382].The benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors was also demonstrated in patients with HF with preserved EF . In the Empagliflozin out - come trial in patients with chronic HF with preserved ejection fraction (EMPEROR-Preserved) trial involving individuals with class II–IV HF and an EF of 40% or higher, the incidence of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening HF was 25% lower in the empa - gliflozin group compared to placebo over an average period of 26 months (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.90; P<0.001) [383].
In all cardiovascular safety studies of SGLT2 inhibitors con - ducted so far, benefits for HF have been proven, suggesting a class effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. This effect has been proven in patients with and without diabetes.Therefore, it is considered clearly beneficial to use SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with dia - betes with HF symptoms to reduce the worsening of HF and cardiovascular death, regardless of the HbA1c levels.Risks SGLT2 inhibitors can cause discomfort in daily life due to poly - uria and consequent frequent urination.In all studies, a de - crease in the eGFR was observed early after the use of SGLT2 inhibitors.Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the eGFR care - fully during this period.There is an increased risk of dehydra - tion and orthostatic hypotension without adequate hydration.
Especially in elderly patients, close monitoring of symptoms related to hypovolemia is required, and thus, it is necessary to check for associated symptoms after SGLT2 inhibitor adminis - tration. The risk of genital infections and urinary tract infec - tions also increases after the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, and there have been reports of cases of Fournier’s gangrene.Although rare, the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) also increases.In some patients, weight loss due to the medication may be prob - lematic.When adding it to prevent worsening HF in patients who were well-controlled with other antidiabetic agents, hypo - glycemia can occur if the dose adjustment of the existing medi - cations is not adequately managed.Balancing the benefits and risks In patients with HF , the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, if accompa - nied by efforts to avoid risks, is thought to prevent the worsen - ing of HF symptoms and potentially reduce mortality.
However, since the diagnosis of HF is made chiefly clinically, and exten - sive testing to diagnose HF could lead to unnecessary health - care expenses socially, it is necessary to select patients who re - quire these tests carefully. 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea603 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgLevel of evidence This recommendation is based on large-scale RCTs that inves - tigated the cardiovascular safety of SGLT2 inhibitors (empa - gliflozin, dapagliflozin, ertugliflozin, canagliflozin) in patients with T2DM who have CVDs or cardiovascular risk factors, and on the meta-analyses of these studies.Additionally, large- scale RCTs on the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors (empa - gliflozin, dapagliflozin) in patients with CKD, regardless of di - abetes status, were evaluated.
Benefits In RCTs treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, a reduction in albumin - uria was observed, along with effects that slow the decline in eGFR and the progression to ESRD. In the EMPA-REG OUT - COME study, empagliflozin demonstrated a 46% reduction in the composite renal endpoints (two-fold increase in serum cre - atinine, initiation of renal replacement therapy, and death due to kidney disease) compared to placebo [384], and in the DE - CLARE-TIMI 58 study, dapagliflozin demonstrated a 30% re - duction in the same composite renal endpoints compared to placebo [292].In both studies, the long-term use of SGLT2 inhibitors showed a reduction in the decline of the eGFR compared to placebo.However, these studies have the limitation of confirming renal outcomes as secondary endpoints.
The Dapagliflozin and Pre - vention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial, conducted on patients with CKD (eGFR 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m², urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 200 to 5,000 mg/g) with or without diabetes, found that the risk of composite renal endpoints including a sustained decline in the eGFR more than 50%, ESRD, or death due to renal or CVD was reduced by 39% in the dapagliflozin arm over place - bo [385]. When the analysis was limited to patients with diabe - tes, a 36% reduction was also observed.A meta-analysis of large clinical trials on SGLT2 inhibitors reported a 19% reduc - tion in the risk for renal endpoints compared to placebo [386].
The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) trial, recruiting patients with CKD (eGFR 25 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or eGFR 45 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥200 mg/g) regardless of diabetes status, showed an 18% reduction in the primary end - point of the composite endpoint of worsening renal function or cardiovascular mortality compared to placebo (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.82; P<0.001) [387]. Notably, unlike previous stud - ies, the EMPA-KIDNEY study included patients with reduced eGFR without proteinuria, confirming the beneficial effects on kidney protection.The KDA and the Korean Society of Nephrology conducted a meta-analysis examining the effect of the domestically avail - able SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function [388].This study confirmed the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing the de - cline in eGFR compared to the control group, but this effect was found with long-term use of over 2 years.
When studies that predominantly included Asians were analyzed separately, no significant effect was observed. Meanwhile, a post hoc analysis of 1,517 Asians in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial showed that treatment with empagliflozin was associated with a reduc - tion in albuminuria progression (36%) and a decrease in the composite renal endpoint (52%) compared to placebo with the effect on reducing the decline in eGFR becoming apparent after about 66 weeks [389].When large-scale RCTs and meta-analyses are comprehen - sively evaluated, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to inhibit the progression of kidney diseases (complications) in patients with T2DM.This appears to have a positive impact at various levels, including the progression of albuminuria, the deteriora - tion of eGFR, and the initiation of renal replacement therapy.
However, since the large-scale clinical trials that provide the evidence mostly involve patients with CVDs, those at high risk for CVDs, or those with evident kidney diseases, SGLT2 inhib - itor treatment can be recommended in these patient groups. Among the commercially available SGLT2 inhibitors in Korea, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin have the highest level of evi - dence.Ipragliflozin lacks large-scale prospective studies; thus, evidence for its effect on delaying the progression of kidney disease is insufficient.The renal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors have been demonstrated not only in patients with diabetes but also in those with CKD without diabetes.
Therefore, it is considered clearly beneficial to use SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetic patients with CKD, regardless of the HbA1c levels, to reduce the worsening of CKD and decrease mortality due to CVDs.Recommendation 10.11 If the patients have albuminuria or re - duced eGFR, SGLT2 inhibitors, which have proven benefits in pro - tecting the kidney, should be used as a priority regardless of HbA1c levels and continued as long as there are no contraindications or ad - verse effects. [Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.604 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgRisks Identical to the Recommendation 10 as mentioned above.Balancing the benefits and risks According to the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, SGLT2 inhibitors can be used for renal protection in CKD but should not be used if the eGFR is less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m² for empagliflozin and less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m² for dapa - gliflozin.
If the eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m², the glu - cose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is reduced, and addi - tional drugs of other classes should be used for glycemic con - trol. Level of evidence 1) SGLT2 inhibitors Recently, large-scale RCTs and meta-analyses on the cardiovas - cular effects of antidiabetic agents have been published, making cardiovascular benefits an essential factor to consider when se - lecting oral antidiabetic agents.This recommendation is based on RCTs and meta-analyses involving SGLT2 inhibitors.2) GLP-1RA This recommendation is based on three double-blind RCTs on the cardiovascular safety of GLP-1RAs, specifically the current - ly available in Korea, liraglutide and dulaglutide, and semaglu - tide, which will be available in the future.The level of evidence is categorized as a RCT because the recommendation was eval - uated based on RCTs.
Benefits 1) SGLT2 inhibitors In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial involving 7,020 patients with T2DM and cardiovascular risk factors, empagliflozin ad - ministration over an average of 3 years resulted in a 14% re - duction in cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non- fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke) compared to pla - cebo (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.99; P=0.04) [291]. Subse - quent analysis of Asian participants from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study also showed a similar effect on all-cause mortality or HF outcomes as in Westerners, with a HR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.95) for the 3-point major cardiovascular ad -verse events [390].A meta-analysis of five RCTs with a duration of over 2 years and involving 351,476 participants, demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events by 20%, all-cause mortality by 33%, and hospitalization for HF by 38% [391].
In a meta-analysis of six randomized placebo-controlled trials on the cardiovascular effects of four SGLT2 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.95; Q statistic, P=0.27), and hospitalization for HF and death from cardiovascular causes (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.84; Q statistic, P=0.09). Irrespective of the presence of underlying ASCVD, SGLT2 inhibitor treat - ment was associated with a reduced risk of major cardiovascular events, hospitalization for HF , and death from CVD [386].The analysis included a total of 46,969 patients with T2DM, 66.2% of whom had ASCVD, with a mean age of 63.7 years, 65.9% male, and 78.5% Caucasian.The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, CANV AS program, DECLARE-TIMI 58, Canagliflozin and Re - nal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE), and VERTIS-CV studies were in - cluded.
A meta-analysis of four large trials of SGLT2 inhibitors, including the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, CANV AS, DE - CLARE-TIMI 58, and CREDENCE also reported that SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events, death from cardiovascular causes, and all-cause mortality, regardless of the presence of underlying CVD or HF [392,393]. In a meta-analysis of three large-scale clinical trials on SGLT2 inhibitors, including the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, CAN - V AS and DECLARE-TIMI 58, a reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events was observed only in patients with un - derlying ASCVD, which presents a slight difference from the previous analysis.However, this analysis also showed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization due to HF regardless of the presence of underly - ing CVD or HF [394].
Therefore, in patients with diabetes and concomitant AS - CVD, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors can significantly reduce ma - jor cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death, and hospital - ization due to HF , as demonstrated in previous studies. 2) GLP-1RAs The primary endpoint of large clinical trials on the cardiovas - cular safety of GLP-1RAs was the incidence of three-point ma -Recommendation 10.12 In patients with ASCVD, SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1RA, which have proven cardiovascular benefits, should be prioritized.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea605 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgjor cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, non- fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke.There were differences in severity in the three large-scale clinical trials as - sessed for this recommendation because the proportions of patients with underlying ASCVD varied.
The Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of CV Outcome Results (LEADER) trial, a double-blind study of 9,340 patients with T2DM, randomized participants to either liraglutide or placebo, where 81% of participants having un - derlying ASCVD, and the remaining 19% only having risk fac - tors for ASCVD [293]. The total of the three major cardiovas - cular events, the primary endpoint, decreased by 13% with li - raglutide compared to placebo (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97).This effect was contributed by reductions in cardiovas - cular death (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93), asymptomatic/ non-fatal/fatal myocardial infarction (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.00), and non-fatal/fatal stroke (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.06).All-cause mortality was reduced by 15% with liraglutide compared with placebo (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.97), pri - marily due to a reduction in cardiovascular deaths.
There was no statistically significant reduction in hospitalization for HF with liraglutide compared to placebo (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.05). The Trial to Evaluate CV and Other Long-term Outcomes With Semaglutide in Subjects With T2D (SUSTAIN-6) trial used the same inclusion criteria as the LEADER trial, a double- blind study of 3,297 adults with T2DM, randomized to either semaglutide or placebo, where 72% of participants having un - derlying ASCVD [395].The aggregate of the three major car - diovascular events, the primary endpoint of the study, was re - duced by 26% with semaglutide compared to placebo (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.95).The results for each component were as follows: cardiovascular death (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.48), non-fatal myocardial infarction (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.08), and non-fatal stroke (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.99).
There was no statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.50) or hospitalization for HF (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.61) with semaglutide com - pared to placebo. The Researching CV Events With a Weekly Incretin in Dia - betes (REWIND) trial was a double-blind study of 9,901 adults with T2DM, randomized to dulaglutide or placebo [294].Un - like the two studies above, in this study, only 31% of partici - pants had underlying ASCVD, and more than half of the pa - tients had risk factors for ASCVD but did not have the AS -CVD.The total of the three major cardiovascular events, the primary endpoint of the study, was reduced by 12% with dula - glutide compared to placebo (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.99).
There was no statistical significance in cardiovascular death (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.06) or non-fatal/fatal myocardial infarction (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.15), but the risk of non- fatal/fatal stroke was reduced by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.94). The reduction in major cardiovascular events was consistent regardless of the presence of underlying ASCVD.There was no statistically significant reduction in hospitaliza - tion or emergency room visits for HF with dulaglutide com - pared to placebo (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.12).In the RE - WIND study, 69% of the participants were T2DM adults with - out underlying ASCVD.Even in this case, dulaglutide reduced the occurrence of major cardiovascular events to the same ex - tent, suggesting that it could be considered for primary preven - tion as well as secondary prevention (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.02 for both; P for interaction=0.97).
However, because there is no other large-scale RCT yet for patients without underlying ASCVD, it is necessary to confirm whether consistent results will be reported in other studies involving these participants. In summary, liraglutide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of three-point major car - diovascular events in patients with T2DM who have underly - ing ASCVD.To date, the GLP-1RAs approved by the U.S.FDA for these cardiovascular effects include liraglutide, dulaglutide, and injectable semaglutide, where liraglutide and dulaglutide are currently available in Korea.Risks 1) SGLT2 inhibitors Identical to the Recommendation 10 as mentioned above.2) GLP-1RA Identical to the Recommendation 10 as mentioned above.Considerations 1) SGLT2 inhibitors SGLT2 inhibitors have a pronounced effect in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events, deaths due to CVD, and hospi - talizations due to HF , as well as improving renal endpoints.
Even when considering the adverse reactions of SGLT2 inhibi - tors, the benefits significantly outweigh the risks, warranting their proactive use in patients indicated for it. However, when prescribing this class of antidiabetic agents, it is essential to dis - Moon JS, et al.606 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgcuss the expected benefits and potential side effects with the pa - tients, ensuring that patients’ preferences are considered in the decision-making process.Furthermore, healthcare providers should be aware of the glucose-lowering efficacy of SGLT2 in - hibitors (0.5% to 0.8% reduction in HbA1c) and ensure proper medication adjustments when adding or changing drugs.2) GLP-1RAs In cases of underlying ASCVD, combination therapy with GLP- 1RAs clearly reduces major adverse cardiovascular events.The potent glucose-lowering effect, relatively low risk of hypoglyce - mia, and the benefits of weight loss are advantages of GLP-1RAs, and the benefits are evident.
However, GLP-1RAs, being inject - able, have lower accessibility compared to oral medications such as SGLT2 inhibitors. Their high cost can impose significant eco - nomic burdens, and they frequently cause GI side effects, which can reduce patient compliance with the medication.Alternatives and considerations Through large-scale clinical studies, GLP-1RAs have been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk to a similar degree as SGLT2 inhib - itors.As they can inhibit the progression of kidney disease, they may be an alternative treatment for individuals with a severe de - cline in renal function or those who cannot use SGLT2 inhibitors due to adverse reactions.In a prospective RCT targeting patients with T2DM with concomitant macrovascular disease, pioglitazone significantly reduced the concomitant secondary endpoint of all-cause mor - tality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke by 16% [396].
Caution is needed in patients with HF due to its adverse reac - tions, such as edema and weight gain. In two recently published meta-analyses, DPP-4 inhibitors did not increase the risk of major cardiovascular events (car - diovascular death/non-fatal myocardial infarction/non-fatal stroke), cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, or hospitalization for HF compared with controls [397,398].Therefore, DPP-4 inhibitors can also be considered as an alternative to SGLT2 inhibitors when an oral antidiabetic agent with cardiovascular safety is needed.Table 8.

Patients with comorbid ASCVD, HF , or CKD who are using an SGLT2i or GLP-1RA may be added to metformin, with preference given to drugs from other classes that have demonstrated clinical benefit for each condition. Combination therapy may be initiated earlier in the course of diagnosis to reduce the risk of glycemic control failure, with early combination therapy strongly considered, especially if glycosylated hemo - globin (HbA1c) is greater than 7.5% or greater than 1.5% above target.If glycemic goals are not achieved with a combination of oral hypoglycemic agents, GLP-1RAs or basal insulin should be considered first, and a combination of GLP-1RAs or basal insulin, or insulin intensification, may be used to improve glycemic control.

Individuals with T2DM and obesity should aim to reduce their weight by at least 5% and maintain it through medical nutrition and exercise. [Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2.Antidiabetic agents may be used as adjunct therapy to support lifestyle modifications for weight reduction in obese individuals with T2DM.[Expert opinion, limited recommendation] 3.If the individual does not lose 5% of their body weight within 3 months after initiating anti-obesity medications, a different medication may be considered, or drug therapy should be discontinued.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 4.If individuals with T2DM and a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 fail to reduce weight and exhibit poor blood glucose control on non-surgical treatments, bariatric surgery should be considered.[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 5.A multidisciplinary medical approach is required before and after surgery to enhance the efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery.
[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 11.1 Individuals with T2DM and obesity should aim to reduce their weight by at least 5% and maintain it through medical nutrition and exercise. [Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Level of evidence Systematic reviews, RCTs, cluster RCTs, and the Korean Soci - ety for Obesity’s Obesity Guidelines 2022 served as the primary evidence sources for the recommendations [144,147,399-402].The nature of lifestyle intervention studies often precludes rig - orous double-blinding, which may introduce bias due to devia - tions from the intended intervention.The limitation of Di - RECT study of a single ethnic group further restricts the appli - cability of its evidence.Despite these limitations, the evidence level is classified as a ‘RCT, ’ and the recommendation is deemed a ‘general recommendation’ because the benefits significantly outweigh the risks.
Benefits A systematic review comparing the effects of weight loss with and without lifestyle interventions in obese individuals with T2DM found that maintaining a weight loss of at least 5% of pre-treatment weight 1-year post-intervention was associated with significant improvements in several metabolic markers, including blood glucose, lipids, and blood pressure [144]. The Look Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) study confirmed the effectiveness of active lifestyle modification in people with T2DM and a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or higher.This in - tervention involved limiting total caloric intake to 1,200 to 1,800 kcal per day, aiming for at least 7% weight loss, and en -gaging in at least 175 minutes of moderate physical activity weekly [399].After 1 year, the active lifestyle intervention group achieved an 8.6% weight loss, compared to 0.7% in the usual care group and 6.0% versus 3.5% at the study’s end [399].
At an 8-year follow-up, the intervention group’s average weight loss was 4.7%, with about 50% losing 5% or more and 27% los - ing 10% or more of their body weight [403]. While the active lifestyle modification did not reduce the risk of major cardio - vascular events and death—the primary endpoint—it im - proved metabolic markers, including blood glucose, and re - duced the need for insulin, antihypertensive, and lipid-lower - ing medications [399].In a long-term observational study, maintaining a weight loss of 10% or more reduced the risk of death by over 20% compared to those who maintained or gained weight in the first year [404].The DiRECT study inves - tigated the effects of a dietary intervention on weight loss and diabetes remission in individuals with T2DM, a BMI of 27 to 45 kg/m2, and duration of diabetes of 6 years or less, not using insulin.
The intervention consisted of an 825 to 853 kcal/day meal replacement for 3 to 5 months, followed by a gradual re - introduction of food over 2 to 8 weeks to maintain weight loss [147]. One-year post-intervention, 24% of the intervention group lost 15 kg or more, and 46% achieved diabetes remis - sion.Two years later, the figures were 11% for the intervention group losing 15 kg or more versus 2% in the control group, 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea609 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgwith diabetes remission rates at 36% and 3%, respectively [147, 401].Moreover, at the 2-year follow-up, 64% of participants who maintained a weight loss of 10 kg or more achieved diabe - tes remission [401].
Risks Weight loss is associated with side effects such as biliary stones, cholecystitis, gallbladder pain, loss of muscle mass and strength, water and electrolyte imbalances, liver disorders, increased uric acid, constipation or diarrhea, hair and skin damage, and ther - moregulatory disorders [402]. Active lifestyle modification in - terventions, such as diet and exercise regimens, can potentially increase expense.Balancing the benefits and risks The Look AHEAD study investigated severe adverse effects of weight loss, such as hypoglycemia, cholelithiasis, fractures, risk of amputation, and HF , and found no significant increase in harm associated with the intervention [399].Long-term fol - low-up showed economic benefits, including reduced hospital - ization rates and healthcare costs, in the group undergoing ag - gressive lifestyle intervention [405].
Similarly, the DiRECT study reported no significant increase in adverse events associ - ated with weight loss interventions [147,401]. Consequently, it can be concluded that the benefits of weight loss and mainte - nance through active lifestyle modification in obese individu - als with T2DM significantly outweigh the potential harms.Alternatives, and considerations when using the guidelines In South Korea, obesity is defined as a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or great - er and a waist circumference of 90 cm or greater for men, and 85 cm or greater for women [402].Lifestyle modification for weight loss should involve the patient’s active participation and be guided by a professional.For effective glycemic control in obese individuals with diabe - tes, the impact of hypoglycemic agents on body weight should be considered.Metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1RAs are associated with weight loss effects.
DPP-4 inhibitors have a neutral effect on weight, while insulin, sulfonylureas, and thia - zolidinediones are associated with weight gain [406].Level of evidence A systematic review of drug-specific RCTs, recently published RCTs, and the Korean Society of Obesity’s Obesity Guideline 2022 served as the primary sources of evidence for the recom - mendations [402,407-416]. Although the systematic review encompassed numerous RCTs and meta-analyses, it did not fully address the risk of bias or consider heterogeneity among the individual studies.Recommendation 2, despite its wide - spread use in clinical practice, lacked sufficient high-level evi - dence to support its application specifically in the Korean pop - ulation; hence, the evidence level was classified as ‘expert opin - ion, ’ and the recommendation was given a ‘limited recommen - dation’ grade.
For Recommendation 3, the evidence level was designated as ‘RCT, ’ and the recommendation was ‘general rec - ommendation’ because the benefits outweighed the risks. Benefits The following medications are currently licensed in Korea for long-term use beyond 12 weeks: orlistat (Xenical, Roche Phar - maceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), naltrexone/bupropion (Con - trave, Orexigen Therapeutics Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA), liraglu - tide (Saxenda, Novo Nordisk), and phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia, Vivus, Campbell, CA, USA).Pharmacological treat - ment for obesity is generally associated with a weight loss of 3% to 7%.However, the clinical evidence to judge the benefits of recommendations using a BMI cutoff of 25 kg/m2 as a cutoff point is limited.
Generally, if an adequate response is not ob - served after 3 months of initiating an anti-obesity medication, the medication should be switched or discontinued, weighing the risk of adverse drug reactions against the benefit of reduced treatment costs [402,410]. An RCT examining the effects of orlistat 120 mg three times daily in individuals with T2DM on metformin reported a mean weight loss of 4.6% and a HbA1c reduction of 0.61% in the orli - stat group over 52 weeks, both significantly higher than those in the placebo group [407].In the 56-week Contrave Obesity Re - search-Diabetes (COR-DM) study involving 505 individuals with T2DM and a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater, 44.5% of the nal -Recommendation 11.2 Antidiabetic agents may be used as adjunct therapy to support lifestyle modifications for weight reduction in obese individuals with T2DM.
[Expert opinion, limited recommen -dation] Recommendation 11.3 If the individual does not lose 5% of their body weight within 3 months after initiating anti-obesity medications, a different medication may be considered, or drug therapy should be discontinued. [Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.610 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgtrexone/bupropion group and 18.9% of the placebo group lost 5% or more of their body weight [408].Additionally, 44.1% in the naltrexone/bupropion group and 26.3% in the placebo group achieved an HbA1c of less than 7%, a significant differ - ence.The Satiety and Clinical Adiposity-Liraglutide Evidence in Nondiabetic and Diabetic Individuals (SCALE) study, con - ducted over 56 weeks with 846 individuals with T2DM and a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater [409], found that liraglutide 3.0 mg/ day led to a 4% weight loss compared to placebo.
The propor - tion of individuals losing 5% or more of their weight was 54.3% in the liraglutide group versus 21.4% in the placebo group. For a 10% or more weight loss, the figures were 25.2% in the liraglutide group compared to 6.7% in the placebo group.The CONQUER study randomized individuals with a BMI of 27 to 45 kg/m2 and at least two metabolic disease risk factors to placebo, once-daily phentermine/topiramate (7.5/46.0 mg), or phentermine/topira - mate (15/92.0 mg) for 56 weeks [411].Among participants, 16% had T2DM or IGT.In this subgroup, weight loss was 4.9% with the phentermine/topiramate (7.5/46.0 mg) group and 6.9% with the phentermine/topiramate (15/92.0 mg) group com - pared to placebo, with HbA1c decrease of an average of 0.4% in the drug groups.Recently, evidence for newer drugs for the treatment of obe - sity has been introduced.
The STEP 2 study randomized 1,210 subjects with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater and HbA1c of 7% to 10% to semaglutide 2.4 mg, semaglutide 1.0 mg, or placebo group for 68 weeks [412]. The mean weight loss was 9.6% in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, 6.9% in the semaglutide 1.0 mg group, and 3.4% in the placebo group.The percentages of sub - jects achieving 5% or greater weight loss were 68.8%, 57.1%, and 28.5%, respectively.The STEP 6 study, conducted in South Korea and other East Asian populations, randomized 401 sub - jects with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater with two or more risk factors or a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or greater with one or more risk factors, to semaglutide 2.4 mg, semaglutide 1.0 mg, or placebo group for 68 weeks [413].Mean weight loss was 13.2% in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, 9.6% in the semaglutide 1.0 mg group, and 2.1% in the placebo group.The percentages of sub - jects achieving 5% or greater weight loss were 83%, 72%, and 21%, respectively.
The SURPASS-1 study randomized 478 indi - viduals to placebo and 5, 10, and 15 mg doses of tirzepatide for 40 weeks [414]. HbA1c reductions, corrected for the effect of placebo, were 1.91%, 1.93%, and 2.11% with the 5, 10, and 15 mg doses, respectively.Weight loss was 7.0 to 9.5 kg and dose- dependent.The SURPASS-2 study compared the effects of tirz -epatide and semaglutide in 1,879 individuals with T2DM inad - equately controlled with metformin [415].Participants were randomized to receive 5, 10, or 15 mg/week of tirzepatide or 1.0 mg/week of semaglutide for 40 weeks.By the end of the study, mean HbA1c decreased by 2.01%, 2.24%, and 2.3% with the 5, 10, and 15 mg doses of tirzepatide, respectively, and by 1.86% in the semaglutide arm.Weight decreased by 7.6, 9.3, and 11.2 kg with the 5, 10, and 15 mg doses of tirzepatide, re - spectively, and by 5.7 kg in the semaglutide arm.
The SUR - PASS-3 study confirmed the effectiveness of combined treat - ment with tirzepatide or insulin degludec in 1,444 individuals with T2DM inadequately controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents [416]. After 52 weeks of intervention, HbA1c decreased by 1.93%, 2.20%, and 2.37% with the 5, 10, and 15 mg doses of tirzepatide, respectively, and by 1.34% in the insulin degludec group.A significant dose-dependent decrease in body weight from 7.5 to 12.9 kg was observed in the tirzepatide group, com - pared to a 2.3 kg increase in the insulin degludec group.Risks Harms include drug-related side effects and contraindications.Orlistat may cause fatty stools, abdominal bloating, and gas, increased bowel movements, and fecal incontinence.
Naltrex - one/bupropion may lead to nausea, constipation, headache, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, dry mouth, diarrhea, anxiety, hot flashes, fatigue, tremor, epigastric pain, viral gastroenteri - tis, tinnitus, urinary tract infections, hypertension, abdominal pain, hyperhidrosis, irritability, increased blood pressure, taste abnormalities, and palpitations. Liraglutide and semaglutide can induce nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dyspep - sia, abdominal pain, bloating, belching, gastroesophageal re - flux disease (GERD), dry mouth, gastritis, hypoglycemia, in - jection site reactions (redness and itching), fatigue, weakness, dizziness, taste changes, sleep disturbances, gallstones, and ele - vated lipase/amylase levels.Adverse reactions with phenter - mine/topiramate may include paresthesias/parageusia, mood and sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, decreased se - rum bicarbonate, decreased serum potassium, increased se - rum creatinine, and nephrolithiasis.
The most common ad - verse reactions associated with tirzepatide to date have been GI, including nausea and vomiting, occurring at a frequency similar to that observed with semaglutide. Balancing the benefits and risks Large clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea611 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgof long-term anti-obesity medications.However, most of these studies have been limited to individuals with a BMI >30 or >27.5 kg/m2 and comorbid risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and sleep apnea.There is limited evi - dence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of antidia - betic medications in individuals with T2DM with a BMI of 25.0 kg/m2 or greater.
Alternatives, considerations when using the guidelines Long-term maintenance of weight loss is crucial in obesity pharmacotherapy, both for weight loss itself and for the im - provement of related complications. Therefore, drugs approved for long-term use, based on large-scale clinical studies, should be prioritized [402].Recent RCTs on new obesity treatment drugs have been published, promising to alter the clinical land - scape in the future.In clinical practice, there exists a group that is non-responsive to obesity medications.If significant weight loss is not achieved in the initial stages of treatment, continuing the treatment is unlikely to result in weight loss success.In most clinical studies, the response to weight loss within the first 12 weeks indicates of 1-year outcomes.
Therefore, if there is less than a 5% to 10% reduction in pre-treatment weight after 12 weeks of medication, individuals may face the risks of side ef - fects and increased costs without benefiting from the treat - ment. Level of evidence RCTs and systematic reviews of bariatric surgery, meta-analy - ses focusing on Asian populations, and the Korean Society for Obesity’s Obesity Guidelines 2022 served as the primary sourc - es of evidence for these recommendations [402,417-422].Due to the inherent nature of surgical interventions, the RCTs were not blinded, yet they were unlikely to be biased.Systematic re - views and meta-analyses rigorously analyzed RCTs with a low risk of bias.However, the applicability of these findings may be limited as most studies were conducted in Western popula - tions.Recommendation 4 is widely used in clinical practice, yet there is insufficient high-level evidence to support its effective - ness, specifically within the Korean population.
Consequently, the evidence level for this recommendation is categorized as ‘limited evidence from RCTs, ’ leading to its classification as a ‘limited recommendation. ’ For Recommendation 5, the evi - dence level is ‘expert opinion, ’ it is designated as a ‘general rec - ommendation’ due to its widespread use in clinical practice and the overall benefits outweighing the risks.Benefits The literature identifies diabetes remission as the primary out - come of interest, with secondary outcomes including weight loss, improvement in metabolic markers, and medication dis - continuation.The Surgical Treatment and Medications Poten - tially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) study com - pared the effectiveness of bariatric metabolic surgery to medi - cation therapy in 150 individuals with T2DM and a BMI of 27 to 43 kg/m2 [417].
At a 5-year follow-up, diabetes remission (HbA1c <6.0%) was achieved by 29% of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group, 23% of the gastric sleeve group, and 5% of the medication-only group, highlighting a significant benefit in fa - vor of surgery. Additionally, body weight decreased by 23%, 19%, and 5% in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrecto - my, and medication groups, respectively, with corresponding reductions in insulin use of 35%, 34%, and 13% [417].A sin - gle-center, randomized, controlled, long-term follow-up study in Italy compared the effectiveness of surgical versus pharma - cological treatments in 60 individuals with T2DM of at least 5 years duration, a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or greater, and an HbA1c of 7.0% or greater [418].
At the 10-year mark, 37.5% of all surgi - cally treated individuals (25.0% in the Roux-en-Y gastric by - pass group and 50.0% in the biliopancreatic diversion group) maintained diabetes remission, defined as fasting glucose <100 mg/dL and HbA1c <6.5%, a stark contrast to the medi - cation arm, where no subjects except one who underwent ad - ditional surgery-maintained remission. A meta-analysis as - sessing the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass’s effectiveness in individ - uals with T2DM and a BMI of 30 to 40 kg/m2 found the OR of achieving diabetes remission significantly higher in the surgi - cal group than in the medical treatment group, with an OR of 17.48 (95% CI, 4.28 to 71.35) and notably lower HbA1c levels [419].
Diabetes remission rates at a 3-year follow-up of the 256 participants in the STAMPEDE, TRIABETES, Surgery or Life - style With Intensive Medical Management in the Treatment of Recommendation 11.4 If individuals with T2DM and a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 fail to reduce weight and exhibit poor blood glucose control on non-surgical treatments, bariatric surgery should be consid - ered. [Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] Recommendation 11.5 A multidisciplinary medical approach is required before and after surgery to enhance the efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.612 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgType 2 Diabetes (SLIMM-T2D), and CROSSROADS studies were 37.5% in the bariatric metabolic surgery group versus 2.6% in the control group [421].Furthermore, significant dif - ferences were observed in metabolic markers such as HbA1c, FPG, and BMI.
A comprehensive meta-analysis encompassing a population of approximately 170,000 individuals revealed that, compared to controls, bariatric surgery led to a 49.2% re - duction in the HR and extended median life expectancy by 6.1 years [422]. The benefits of bariatric surgery were even more notable among people with diabetes, with those undergoing surgery experiencing a median life extension of 9.3 years com - pared to their non-surgical counterparts.The existing evidence on racial differences in bariatric sur - gery outcomes is sparse.A meta-analysis examining bariatric surgery outcomes among Asians (including Chinese, Taiwan - ese, and Indian populations) reported that the Roux-en-Y gas - tric bypass group achieved an excess weight loss of 83.4%, while the sleeve gastrectomy group saw a 65.1% loss [420].Al - though diabetes remission rates were higher in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group, no significant differences were observed between the surgical methods [420].
Additionally, employing a multidisciplinary team approach has proven to enhance the safety and effectiveness of both sur - gical and perioperative patient care. A retrospective study highlighted that multidisciplinary care significantly improved the quality of perioperative management in bariatric metabolic surgery [423].Risks Risks associated with bariatric metabolic surgery encompass surgical site strictures, leaks, fistulas, marginal ulcers, GERD, gastric outlet obstruction, hernias, dumping syndrome, ane - mia, hypoglycemia, malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D, osteoporosis, deficiencies in protein and micronutrients, de - pression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation [402].Additionally, in - dividuals face the risk of needing additional surgery, experi - encing weight regain, recurrence of diabetes, and challenges in conducting regular endoscopic surveillance of the bypassed stomach during long-term follow-up.
Moreover, there may be an increase in healthcare utilization and associated costs for individuals in the surgical group. Balancing the benefits and risks Bariatric surgery is associated with significant weight loss, dia - betic remission, and glycemic improvement in individuals with T2DM, offering additional benefits such as reduced risk of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, CVD, and improved quality of life [424,425].Furthermore, with the advancement of surgical techniques, the rate of complications associated with bariatric surgery continues to decrease.Therefore, it can be concluded that the benefits of bariatric metabolic surgery outweigh the risks.While systematic evidence for multidisci - plinary care in bariatric metabolic surgery is lacking, the gen - eral benefits of this approach are considered to outweigh the harms.However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend bariatric surgery as a primary treatment for T2DM in Asians with a BMI of 30 to 35 kg/m2.
Various alternatives, considerations when using the guidelines Types of bariatric metabolic surgery include sleeve gastrecto - my, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and biliopancreatic diversion/ duodenal switch. For individuals with T2DM, sleeve gastrecto - my and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are primarily considered, with a preference for Roux-en-Y .There is insufficient evidence to differentiate the effectiveness and safety between these two procedures.Some meta-analyses suggest that Roux-en-Y gas - tric bypass may be more effective for weight loss compared to sleeve gastrectomy, yet no significant difference in diabetes remission rates has been observed [426,427].Additionally, a large-scale meta-analysis found no significant difference in treatment effectiveness based on the surgical method [422].
In Korea, sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are designated as selective medical coverage for individuals with T2DM who have a BMI of 27.5 kg/m2 or more but not exceed - ing 30 kg/m2, and who have not achieved glycemic control through conventional medical treatment and lifestyle modifi - cation. There is ongoing debate regarding the efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery for individuals with T2DM and the specific surgical indications for Asians with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or low - er.During the 2011 International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders Asia-Pacific Chapter (IFSO- APC), it was highlighted that Asians face an increased risk of developing metabolic diseases, including T2DM, at relatively lower BMIs.It was proposed that a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or higher, or 30 kg/m2 or higher with comorbidities such as uncontrolled T2DM or metabolic syndrome, should be the criteria for con - sidering bariatric metabolic surgery [428].
The 2016 Diabetes Surgery Summit (DSS-II) further suggested lowering the BMI threshold for Asians by 2.5 kg/m2, recommending bariatric 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea613 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgsurgery for those with a BMI of 27.5 kg/m2 or higher who ex - perience poor glycemic control despite lifestyle modifications and medication [429]. In 2018, The American Society for Met - abolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) advised that bariatric surgery should be strongly considered for individuals with T2DM and a BMI of 30 to 35 kg/m2, without specifically ad - dressing racial differences [430].Concerning the age for undergoing surgery, there was tradi -tionally an age limit of 18 to 65 years.However, recent guide - lines have relaxed significant age restrictions.For adolescents, it is recommended that they be at least 14 years old, have com - pleted bone growth, and exhibit secondary sexual characteris - tics.
While bariatric surgery is generally safe, it is crucial to note that the rate of complications can vary based on the sur - geon’s expertise and the volume of procedures conducted by the healthcare facility.

However, a combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 10.If blood pressure exceeds 160/100 mm Hg, lifestyle should be corrected aggressively, and a combination of two or more medications should be initiated.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 12.1 Blood pressure should be measured in individuals with diabetes at every hospital visit.[Expert opinion, general rec - ommendation] Recommendation 12.2 Home blood pressure monitoring is recommended for individuals with diabetes and hypertension.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Level of evidence Although research on the frequency of blood pressure measure - ment for early detection of hypertension in individuals with di - abetes is lacking, most experts recommend measuring blood pressure at every hospital visit. Therefore, the level of evidence has been assessed as an ‘expert opinion.’ Since the benefits of the recommendation outweigh any potential harm, making it ad - visable for most individuals with diabetes, the scope of the rec - ommendation has been assessed as a ‘general recommendation.’Based on evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses that high - light the utility of home blood pressure monitoring for diag - nosing hypertension and assessing treatment efficacy, the rec - ommendation for home blood pressure measurement has been assessed as a ‘general recommendation.’ Benefits Hypertension is one of the risk factors for both microvascular and macrovascular complications in individuals with diabetes.
2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea615 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgCVD is a major cause of death among people with diabetes, and large-scale RCTs have demonstrated that blood pressure management can significantly reduce mortality. Thus, control - ling blood pressure in individuals with diabetes is critical to preventing myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal failure and decreasing the related mortality [431].The 2022 Diabetes Fact Sheet from the KDA reports that the prevalence of hyperten - sion in Koreans with diabetes aged 30 years and older is 58.6%, increasing to 71.7% in those aged 65 and older.However, the hypertension control rate stands at only 55.5% for those aged 30 and over and 60.9% for those aged 65 and over, indicating that many individuals have inadequately controlled blood pres - sure [432].
It is very important for individuals with diabetes to have an early diagnosis of hypertension and receive proper treatment according to blood pressure targets. Accurate blood pressure measurement is foundational for hypertension diag - nosis, treatment, and prognosis assessment.Given the variabil - ity in blood pressure across different settings, sites, and clinical situations, it should be measured using standardized methods, and it should be measured at every hospital visit.Due to the limitations of office-based blood pressure mea - surements, the importance of out-of-office blood pressure monitoring is increasingly recognized.Home or ambulatory blood pressure measurements are instrumental in diagnosing conditions such as white coats and masked hypertension and are valuable for assessing the effectiveness of treatment.
RCTs and meta-analyses have demonstrated that home blood pres - sure monitoring can increase treatment adherence, persis - tence, and blood pressure control in individuals receiving anti - hypertensive medications [433]. Assessing risks and balancing harm and benefit The potential harm of implementing the recommendation is unclear, indicating that the benefits of the recommendation outweigh the harm.Alternatives and considerations When measuring blood pressure, it should be conducted in a standardized manner using a validated sphygmomanometer.
Ensure individuals are at rest for at least 5 minutes, with both feet on the ground, arms resting on a table, the cuff positioned at heart level, and using the appropriate cuff size for their arm circumference.Level of evidence Based on RCTs and meta-analyses that demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular events and microvascular complications when systolic blood pressure (SBP) is maintained below 140 mm Hg in individuals with diabetes, the level of evidence has been as - sessed as a ‘RCT’ and the scope of the recommendation has been assessed as a ‘general recommendation. ’ RCTs and meta- analyses targeting a SBP lower than 140 mm Hg in individuals with diabetes who have CVD or are at high risk for CVD have shown cardiovascular benefits.Consequently, the level of evi - dence has been assessed a ‘RCT’ and the scope of recommenda - tion has been assessed a ‘general recommendation.
’ Benefits Numerous studies have investigated blood pressure control targets in individuals with diabetes, with various RCTs and meta-analyses indicating that maintaining SBP below 140 mm Hg can reduce cardiovascular events and microvascular com - plications [434]. The 2010 ACCORD study, which focused on individuals with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk, found that lowering SBP below 120 mm Hg was associated with an in - crease in adverse events and did not offer benefits in cardiovas - cular risk reduction compared to maintaining SBP below 140 mm Hg [435].Conversely, the 2015 Systolic Blood Pressure In - tervention Trial (SPRINT), which excluded individuals with diabetes or stroke but included individuals with high cardio - vascular risk, demonstrated that controlling SBP to below 120 mm Hg improved cardiovascular outcomes compared to a tar - get below 140 mm Hg leading to recommendations for lower blood pressure targets [436].
A subsequent re-analysis of the ACCORD participants using the SPRINT inclusion criteria indicated that individuals with diabetes also benefited from maintaining SBP below 120 mm Hg [437]. Consequently, in 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommended that individuals with hyper -Recommendation 12.3 It is recommended that individuals with di - abetes but without CVDs or risk factors maintain their blood pres - sure level at <140/90 mm Hg.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 12.4 Individuals with diabetes with CVD, end- organ damage (albuminuria, CKD, retinopathy, left ventricular hy - pertrophy), or risk factors for CVD should maintain their blood pressure at <130/80 mm Hg.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.616 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgtension aim for blood pressure control below 130/80 mm Hg [438].
The 2018 European Society of Hypertension recommen - dations suggested that the primary target for SBP in individu - als with diabetes should be reduced to 130 mm Hg and, if tol - erable, maintained below 130 mm Hg but not below 120 mm Hg [439]. The Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients (STEP) study in 2021 revealed that hypertensive individuals aged 60 to 80 years experienced a 26% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events when achiev - ing SBP control between 110 and 130 mm Hg, compared to control between 130 and 150 mm Hg [440].However, no studies have demonstrated a clear advantage in lowering SBP to less than 130 mm Hg over maintaining it be - low 140 mm Hg in individuals with diabetes who do not have comorbid cardiovascular risk factors.Most of the previously mentioned studies involved individuals with diabetes who had comorbid CVD or numerous cardiovascular risk factors.
Con - sequently, there is still no definitive evidence supporting the maintenance of SBP below 130 mm Hg in the general diabetic population. The Korean Society of Hypertension, in its 2022 re - vised recommendations, advises controlling blood pressure to below 140/90 mm Hg in individuals with diabetes without car - diovascular risk factors, CVD, CKD stages 3, 4, or 5, and as - ymptomatic organ damage.It recommends a target of below 130/80 mm Hg for those with diabetes and one or more cardio - vascular risk factors, CVD, CKD stages 3, 4, or 5, or asymptom - atic organ damage [441].Similarly, the KDA suggests a blood pressure goal of below 140/90 mm Hg for individuals with dia - betes without CVD or cardiovascular risk factors and below 130/80 mm Hg for those with CVD, end-organ damage (such as albuminuria, CKD, retinopathy, or left ventricular hypertro - phy), or cardiovascular risk factors.
Few studies have specifically focused on the control target of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in individuals with diabetes. In the UKPDS, the group with tight blood pressure control achieved a mean DBP of 82 mm Hg and experienced fewer mi - crovascular and cardiovascular complications than the group receiving standard treatment [442].A subanalysis of the Hyper - tension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study compared three groups with DBP targets of 90, 85, and 80 mm Hg, respectively.It was observed that lower DBP was associated with a cardio - vascular benefit in individuals with diabetes, in contrast to those with hypertension but without diabetes [443].Risks Potential adverse events of intensive blood pressure control include hypotension, syncope, falls, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte imbalance.The risk of these adverse events increas - es in individuals who are elderly, have CKD, or exhibit frailty [435,436,444,445].
Balancing risks and benefits In a study targeting patients with CVD and hypertension, a fur - ther analysis was conducted exclusively on individuals with dia - betes. The study was compared between the intensive control group (target SBP <130 mm Hg) and the standard control group (target SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg).The results demonstrat - ed a J-shaped association indicating an increased all-cause mor - tality and primary endpoints, including non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke in the group with SBP below 110 mm Hg and DBP below 60 mm Hg.This finding suggests that excessively lowering blood pressure in individuals with diabe - tes, depending on their specific characteristics, may lead to ad - verse outcomes [446].Blood pressure management in diabetes is complex and should be individualized, considering factors such as glycemic control status, duration of diabetes, presence of comorbidities, and severity of complications.
Alternatives and considerations Generally, cardiovascular risk factors include age (male ≥45 years, female ≥55 years), smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia, and a family history of early CVD. End-organ damage includes albu - minuria, CKD, retinopathy, and left ventricular hypertrophy [439,441].Level of evidence Numerous RCTs and meta-analyses demonstrate the effective - ness of lifestyle modifications, including weight loss, restric - tion of sodium intake, reduction in alcohol consumption, and exercise in reducing blood pressure.Consequently, the level of evidence for the recommendation has been assessed as a ‘RCT.’ Since the benefits of the recommendation outweigh any poten - tial harm, making it advisable for most individuals with diabe -Recommendation 12.5 Individuals with diabetes and blood pres - sure ≥120/80 mm Hg should change their lifestyle, including weight control, proper training, and dietary management, to maintain nor - mal blood pressure.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recom - mendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea617 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgtes, the scope of the recommendation has been assessed as a ‘general recommendation. ’ Benefits A normal blood pressure is defined as a SBP <120 mm Hg and a DBP <80 mm Hg.Lifestyle modification is recommended to maintain normal blood pressure when blood pressure exceeds these thresholds [437].Lifestyle modifications such as healthy eating habits, regular exercise, smoking cessation, reduction in alcohol consumption, and weight loss not only have the effect of lowering blood pressure but also can maximize the efficacy of antihypertensive medications and reduce side effects.Addi - tionally, these modifications reduce other metabolic and car - diovascular risks [204,439,447-451].In individuals with obesity, achieving weight loss can lead to substantial reductions in blood pressure.
A meta-analysis of 25 RCTs reported a decrease of 4.44 and 3.57 mm Hg in SBP and DBP , respectively, following a weight loss of 5.1 kg, achieved through dietary calorie reduction and increased physical activ - ity [448]. Additionally, restriction of sodium intake has proven effective in lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of CVD [449,450].An RCT investigating the DASH diet, which emphasizes increased intake of fruits, vegetables, and fish while reducing fats, demonstrated a significant reduction in blood pressure [204].Excessive alcohol consumption is known to elevate blood pressure, which can be mitigated by abstaining from alcohol [451].Regular exercise also lowers blood pres - sure, with a recommended regimen that includes both aerobic and resistance training [439].Risks The risks associated with lifestyle modifications are not clear.Nonetheless, it is crucial that diet and exercise plans be tailored to the individual’s specific needs and conditions.
Balancing harms and benefits The benefits of lifestyle modification for controlling blood pressure are well-established, while the associated risks remain unclear, indicating that the benefits significantly outweigh the risks. However, maintaining lifestyle modification can be chal - lenging and necessitates sustained motivation and education.Level of evidence Based on RCTs and meta-analyses showing no differences in cardiovascular or renal outcomes across antihypertensive drug classes in diabetes, the evidence level has been assessed as a ‘RCT, ’ and the scope of recommendation has been assessed as a ‘general recommendation, ’ as it is applicable to the majority of the population.Benefits How to start and titrate antihypertensive treatment is summa - rized in Fig.3.Hypertension is diagnosed when the office blood pressure is repeatedly 140/90 mm Hg or higher, and pharmaco - logic treatment is administered for individuals diagnosed with hypertension [439,441].
For individuals with diabetes, first-line antihypertensive medications include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and diuretics. No differences in cardiovascular event prevention have been ob - served among these medication classes, making all of them rec - ommended as first-line therapy [452,453].Risks Thiazide diuretics can affect blood sugar, lipids, sodium, and potassium levels.β-Blockers may influence blood glucose and lipid levels, but no evidence that they directly increase cardio - vascular death in individuals with T2DM [438,439].Alternatives and considerations Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs can raise serum creatinine or potassium levels, therefore monitoring is necessary.If creati - nine rises by no more than 30% from baseline or potassium re - mains below 5.5 mEq/L, discontinuation of the medication is unnecessary.Individuals with serum creatinine levels above 3.0 mg/dL should be cautious of hyperkalemia [438,439].
Level of evidence Based on RCTs and meta-analyses demonstrating the efficacy Recommendation 12.6 Every antihypertensive agent can be used for Individuals with diabetes and hypertension as the first-line therapy. [Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation]Recommendation 12.7 ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended as the first-line therapy for individuals with diabetes and albumin - uria as antihypertensive agents.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 12.8 ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended as the first-line therapy for individuals with diabetes and coronary artery diseases as antihypertensive agents.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.618 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgof ACE inhibitors or ARBs in slowing renal disease progres - sion in individuals with diabetes and albuminuria, the evidence level has been assessed as a ‘RCT, ’ and the scope of recommen - dation has been assessed as a ‘general recommendation. ’ Simi - larly, based on RCTs and meta-analyses that reveal ACE inhibi - tors or ARBs reduce cardiovascular events in individuals with diabetes and coronary artery disease, the evidence level has been assessed as a ‘RCT’ and the scope of recommendation has been assessed as a ‘general recommendation.’ Benefits The selection of antihypertensive medication for individuals with diabetes should consider clinical characteristics and co - morbidities.ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended as the first-line treatment in the presence of albuminuria due to their cardiovascular benefits and ability to reduce albuminuria [454- 456].
For individuals with diabetes and coronary artery disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended as the first-line treatment, supported by their proven ability to reduce cardio - vascular events. In the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, the group taking ramipril showed a reduction in the occurrence of cardiovascular events compared to the place - bo group, indicating that there are RCTs and meta-analyses demonstrating the cardiovascular protective benefits of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in those with coronary artery disease [457- 459].Risks Serum creatinine and potassium levels may increase in indi - viduals with reduced GFRs during ACE inhibitors or ARBs treatment and should be monitored.Balancing risks and benefits In individuals with diabetes, hypertension, albuminuria, or coronary artery disease, the advantages of using ACE inhibitors or ARBs outweigh the risks, offering benefits in decelerating renal disease progression and decreasing cardiovascular events.
Alternatives and considerations In individuals taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs, maintaining med - ication when the GFR decreases to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 may provide cardiovascular benefit without increasing the risk of progression to ESRD [460].Level of evidence RCTs and meta-analyses that examine the effects of combina - tion antihypertensive therapy on lowering blood pressure, along with studies assessing the heightened adverse effects of using ACE inhibitors and ARBs together. Consequently, the evidence level has been assessed as a ‘RCT’ and the scope of recommendation has been assessed as a ‘general recommenda - tion.’ Benefits and harms The ACCORD study highlights that many individuals with hy - pertension do not achieve adequate blood pressure control with a single antihypertensive medication [435], often necessitating a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action.
While it is possible to increase the dosage of the first anti-hy - pertension medication if it is ineffective or if the target blood pressure is not reached, combining low doses of drugs with dif - ferent mechanisms offers the advantages of enhancing the blood pressure-lowering effect and adherence while reducing side effects [461]. Although taking two or more drugs is possi - ble, it remains still uncertain which specific combinations are beneficial in the long-term perspective.Combinations of renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) inhibitors, CCBs, and diuretics generally show favorable outcomes, with some evi - dence suggesting that combining a RAS inhibitor with CCB may be superior in reducing cardiovascular events compared to combining it with a diuretic [462].However, combining ACE inhibitors with ARBs is not advised due to the lack of added benefit in preventing CVD and the potential for increased ad - verse effects, such as hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury [463-465].
Alternatives and considerations Hypertension that remains above 140/90 mm Hg despite the combination of three or more antihypertensive drugs with dif - ferent mechanisms of action, including a diuretic, is referred to as ‘resistant hypertension. ’ It is necessary first to exclude factors such as treatment compliance, white coat hypertension, and secondary causes of hypertension.In cases of resistant hyper -Recommendation 12.9 If the blood pressure level is not controlled with first-line therapy, a combination therapy using drugs with a dif - ferent mechanism of action should be employed.However, a combi - nation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used.[Random - ized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea619 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgtension, adding mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may be considered.
However, when added to patients already taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs, there is a risk of hyperkalemia, neces - sitating the monitoring of serum potassium and creatinine lev - els [466]. Level of evidence Based on RCTs indicating that initial combination therapy en - hances the probability of reaching target blood pressure goals, the level of evidence has been assessed as a ‘RCT, ’ and the scope of the recommendation has been assessed as a ‘general recom - mendation.’ Benefits Randomized studies indicate that initiating treatment with two antihypertensive medications leads to quicker achievement of target blood pressure without significant safety issues com - pared to monotherapy [467-469].If blood pressure exceeds 160/100 mm Hg or is more than 20/10 mm Hg above the tar - get, it is advised to initially consider using two or more agents to enhance effectiveness and achieve rapid blood pressure con - trol [439].
Risks Using initial combination therapy to reduce blood pressure might elevate the risk of adverse events, including dizziness and syncope. Balancing risks and benefits Considering the importance of blood pressure control, the ad - vantages of reaching target blood pressure levels outweigh the risks associated with potential adverse events.Monitoring blood pressure control through frequent follow-up or home blood pressure monitoring is recommended.Recommendation 12.10 If blood pressure exceeds 160/100 mm Hg, lifestyle should be corrected aggressively, and a combination of two or more medications should be initiated.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.620 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgFig.3.Hypertension management.BP , blood pressure; ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; ARB, angiotensin II receptor blocker.

LIPID MANAGEMENT 1.To evaluate the CVD risk, a serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], triglycerides, and LDL- C) should be conducted at the time of initial diabetes diagnosis and annually thereafter.
[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 2. A serum lipid profile is conducted 4 to 12 weeks after initiation of pharmacological therapy to evaluate response and adherence to treat - ment.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 3.The primary goal of lipid management is the control of LDL-C levels.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 4.To determine the LDL-C targets, comorbidities including CVD and end-organ damage (albuminuria, eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, reti - nopathy, and left ventricular hypertrophy), major CVD risk factors (age, family history of premature coronary artery disease, hyperten - sion, smoking, and HDL-C <40 mg/dL), and duration of diabetes should be initially assessed.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 5.The LDL-C targets are as follows: 1) In the presence of CVD, LDL-C levels should be less than 55 mg/dL, with a more than 50% reduction from the baseline.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2) If the duration of disease is 10 years or more, or major CVD risk factors or target organ damage, LDL-C level should be less than 70 mg/dL. [Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 3) In the presence of target organ damage or three or more major CVD risk factors, LDL-C level should be less than 55 mg/dL.[Non-ran - domized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 4) If the disease duration is less than 10 years and no major CVD risk factors are present, LDL-C levels should be less than 100 mg/dL.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 6.Active lifestyle modification is recommended for lipid management, with adherenece monitored.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 7.If the LDL-C target level is not achieved, pharmacological therapy is initiated: 1) Statins should be the first-line therapy.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2) If the target is not achieved with the maximum tolerable statin dose, ezetimibe should be added. [Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 3) In diabetic patients with CVD who do not achieve the target after adding ezetimibe, combination therapy with statins and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors should be considered.[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 8.For severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride levels ≥150 mg/dL), primary treatment should focus on lifestyle modification, including abstinence from alcohol, weight loss, and secondary factors such as glycemic control.[Non-randomized controlled trial, general recom - mendation] 9.In cases of severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride levels ≥500 mg/dL), pharmacological therapy with fenofibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, etc., is initiated to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis.
[Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 13.1 To evaluate the CVD risk, a serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL-C, triglycerides, and LDL-C) should be con - ducted at the time of initial diabetes diagnosis and annually thereafter. [Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 13.2 A serum lipid profile is conducted 4 to 12 weeks after initiation of pharmacological therapy to evaluate response and adherence to treatment.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.622 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgLevel of evidence There are no RCTs regarding the timing and frequency of se - rum lipid tests for assessing CVD risk in the presence of diabe - tes [470].
However, CVD is a leading cause of mortality in dia - betic patients, and evaluating lipid profiles for concomitant CVD risk factors in diabetic patients is recommended at the time of diabetes diagnosis and annually thereafter, according to accredited domestic and international clinical guidelines. Additionally, it is commonly recommended to conduct follow- up lipid tests before initiating medication for dyslipidemia and 4 to 12 weeks after initiation.Therefore, the level of evidence for this recommendation is considered ‘expert opinion, ’ and since the benefit of the recommendation outweighs the harm, it is evaluated as ‘general recommendation.’ Benefits Dyslipidemia is actively targeted for treatment in diabetic pa - tients because the risk of death from CVD is two to four times higher compared to non-diabetic individuals [471].
According to the Diabetes Fact Sheet 2022 by the KDA, 76.1% of T2DM patients in Korea have hypercholesterolemia, with only 53.5% of them reported to have LDL-C levels controlled within the target range (less than 100 mg/dL) [432]. For diabetic patients, it is recommended to conduct compre - hensive serum lipid profile tests (measurement or calculation of total cholesterol, HDL-C, triglycerides, and LDL-C) at the time of diagnosis and annually thereafter to assess CVD risk [472].Additionally, when initiating pharmacological therapy for dyslipidemia, it is recommended to measure serum lipid profile tests before starting medication and 4 to 12 weeks after administration to evaluate the medication’s efficacy and adher - ence.Subsequently, testing every 3 to 12 months is recom - mended based on the patient’s cardiovascular risk and the de - gree of lipid reduction after treatment [473].
Balancing the risks and benefits The harms resulting from the implementation of the recom - mendation are not evident, and the adverse effects due to diffi - culties in assessing CVD risk without implementation are greater. Alternatives and considerations The dyslipidemia typically includes hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C levels in diabetic patients.With an increase in the production of large very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), there is a characteristic increase in small dense LDL particles, and an increase in the number of apolipoprotein B (apoB), even if the high LDL-C levels is not high.Therefore, in addi - tion to routine lipid profile tests, evaluation of diabetic dyslip - idemia can also involve measuring non-HDL-C and apoB [474].Particularly, when tested in a non-fasting state, lipid sta - tus can be assessed using non-HDL-C (total cholesterol minus HDL-C) rather than LDL-C [473].
Level of evidence For diabetic patients, the target for LDL-C control based on the presence of CVD has been derived through RCTs of pri - mary and secondary cardiovascular prevention using pharma - cological interventions, as well as systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses of these studies [475-479]. The level of evi - dence for the LDL-C control target based on the presence of CVD is ‘RCT, ’ and since the benefits of the recommendation outweigh the harms, the recommendation grade is evaluated as ‘general recommendation’ [477-479].For diabetic patients without CVD but with various target organ damage or CVD Recommendation 13.3 The primary goal of lipid management is the control of LDL-C levels.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 13.4 To determine the LDL-C targets, comor - bidities including CVD and end-organ damage (albuminuria, eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, retinopathy, and left ventricular hy - pertrophy), major CVD risk factors (age, family history of prema - ture coronary artery disease, hypertension, smoking, and HDL-C <40 mg/dL), and duration of diabetes should be initially assessed. [Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 13.5 The LDL-C targets are as follows: 1) In the presence of CVD, LDL-C levels should be less than 55 mg/dL, with a more than 50% reduction from the baseline.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2) If the duration of disease is 10 years or more, or major CVD risk factors or target organ damage, LDL-C level should be less than 70 mg/dL.
[Non-randomized controlled trial, general rec - ommendation] 3) In the presence of target organ damage or three or more major CVD risk factors, LDL-C level should be less than 55 mg/dL. [Non-randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 4) If the disease duration is less than 10 years and no major CVD risk factors are present, LDL-C level should be less than 100 mg/dL.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea623 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgrisk factors, the level of evidence for the LDL-C control target is based on review of international clinical guidelines and a large-scale retrospective study conducted in Korean T2DM patients [480].The threshold of less than 55 mg/dL is evaluated as ‘limited recommendation’ due to insufficient evidence sup - porting its universal application in all cases.
Benefits In the UKPDS, LDL-C was the strongest predictor of coronary heart disease in T2DM patients among several risk factors for CVD, and each 39 mg/dL increase in LDL-C increased the cor - onary heart disease risk by about 60% [481]. The Heart Protec - tion Study (HPS) showed that LDL-C lowering with statin therapy reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 22% compared to placebo in diabetic patients, regardless of the presence of previous CVD [482].Subsequent analysis of the HPS secured evidence for the LDL-C target of less than 100 mg/dL in diabetic patients without CVD.Furthermore, in a meta-analysis of 14 RCTs conducted by the Cholesterol Treat - ment Trialists’ Collaboration, it was found that for every ap - proximate reduction of 39 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) in LDL-C with statin therapy, there was a 23% decrease in major cardiovascu - lar events over 5 years, irrespective of baseline LDL levels or other baseline characteristics [483].
Since T2DM patients had a similar relative risk (RR) reduction as non-diabetic patients in this meta-analysis, considering that diabetic patients have a higher absolute risk of CVD, it can be inferred that the absolute benefit of LDL-C lowering with statin therapy may be even more significant. The IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy In - ternational Trial (IMPROVE-IT), Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER), and Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treat - ment With Alirocumab (ODYSSEY OUTCOMES) trials have demonstrated that even when lowering LDL-C to below 70 mg/dL, further reduction in LDL-C reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events [484-486].Moreover, subgroup analyses have shown that the reduction in RR is even greater in cases of diabetes [487] or similar to those without diabetes [488,489].
Therefore, diabetic patients with concomitant CVD are recom - mended to control LDL-C to below 55 mg/dL and achieve a reduction of over 50% from baseline, similar to other high-risk patient groups. In diabetic patients without CVD, the risk of CVD varies among patients.Factors such as duration of dis -ease (over 10 years), albuminuria (urine albumin/creatinine ratio >30 mg/g), CKD (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), retinop - athy, neuropathy, and an ankle-brachial index <0.9 are well- known risk factors for CVD in diabetic patients [490].The 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclero - sis Society guidelines recommend to evaluate risk and provide treatment targets based on the presence of target organ dam - age, age, three or major risk factors (hypertension, dyslipid - emia, smoking, obesity), and durat more ion of diabetes [491].Whether the risk of CVD in Korean diabetic patients can be evaluated using the same criteria as international guidelines is not entirely clear.
However, a recent study utilizing data from the National Health Insurance Service observed 248,000 Korean patients with T2DM aged around 30.90 years over a 9.3-year follow-up period. In this study, it was found that the incidence rate of CVD, defined as myocardial infarction and stroke, in - creased in diabetic patients without previous CVD when CKD, hypertension, longer duration of disease, and major cardiovas - cular risk factors were present [480].Specifically, the risk of CVD increased from an LDL-C level of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in patients with 1.2 major cardiovascular risk factors or a dura - tion of diabetes of over 5 years.Notably, patients with CKD (18.3/1,000 person-years) or three or more major risk factors (14.1/1,000 person-years) showed similar or higher rates of CVD compared to those with previous CVD (14.1/1,000 per - son-years).It was analyzed that the incidence of CVD was low - est when LDL-C was below 55 mg/dL.
Therefore, diabetic pa - tients with a duration of disease of over 10 years or with major cardiovascular risk factors (age [men over 45, women over 55], family history of premature coronary artery disease [men under 55, women under 65], hypertension, smoking, HDL-C below 40 mg/dL), or with target organ damage (albuminuria, eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, retinopathy, left ventricular hyper - trophy) are recommended to control LDL-C to below 70 mg/ dL. Additionally, those diabetic patients with target organ dam - age or three or more major cardiovascular risk factors are selec - tively advised to consider lowering LDL-C to below 55 mg/dL.Based on research indicating a decrease in mortality from CVD with an increase in HDL-C levels [492] the 2001 Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines categorized low HDL- C (less than 40 mg/dL) as a risk factor for CVD and included it as a diagnostic criterion for metabolic syndrome.
While there is no specific upper limit for the treatment target of HDL-C, attention is directed towards low HDL-C as a risk factor for CVD [493]. Moon JS, et al.624 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgRisks The potential harms of implementing lipid concentration tar - gets for CVD risk groups are unclear, but achieving target LDL- C levels often requires lifestyle modifications and drug therapy, particularly statins.Additionally, when combination therapy with medications other than statins is necessary to reach target concentrations, there may be associated risks of side effects from these medications.Balancing the risks and benefits Implementation of lipid control targets for CVD prevention is deemed to outweigh the potential harms associated with life - style modifications and medication use, considering the bene - fits for preventing CVD in diabetic patients.
Alternatives and considerations In diabetic patients, the primary goal is to control LDL-C when implementing recommendations for lipid management targets. If LDL-C reaches the target but hypertriglyceridemia persists or if blood samples are taken in a non-fasting state, non-HDL- C or apoB can be used as targets [494].The target level for non- HDL-C is the LDL-C target plus 30 mg/dL, and typically, in di - abetic patients without other cardiovascular risk factors, the non-HDL-C target is less than 130 mg/dL, and apoB is less than 100 mg/dL.Level of evidence The analysis included a systematic literature review of RCTs [494] and 11 RCTs described by Franz et al.[144].The review by Franz et al.[144] 11 RCTs involving T2DM patients, and it appears to have conducted a thorough systematic search using various databases.
The selection criteria were pre-specified, al - though it did not include judgments on the exclusion of indi - vidual studies or assessments of bias risks in the included stud - ies. Combining this, the level of evidence was rated as ‘RCT, ’ and since the benefits of the recommendation outweigh the risks, the recommendation grade was evaluated as ‘general rec - ommendation.’ Benefits An RCT investigating the impact of the Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular risk in individuals with T2DM or CVD risk fac - tors showed that the risk of CVD decreased by 31% compared to the control group [144].Lifestyle modifications, including dietary adjustments such as the Mediterranean diet and in - creased physical activity, as well as weight loss in obese pa - tients, can improve lipid levels [495].Dietary therapy should be individualized considering factors such as age, type of dia - betes, medication use, lipid levels, and comorbidities.
Con - sumption of saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans fats should be reduced, while intake of omega-3 fatty acids and fiber should be increased. Strict glycemic control can also improve lipid levels, particularly in cases where triglycerides are very high and glycemic control is inadequate.Additionally, abstaining from alcohol and weight loss are effective in treating high tri - glyceride levels.Risks The potential harms of active lifestyle modification remain un - clear.In order to provide systematic education for active life - style modifications, it is necessary to secure adequately trained educational personnel, resources, and education time.Balancing the risks and benefits While RCTs have demonstrated that active lifestyle modifica - tions improve blood lipid levels and prevent CVD, the risks as - sociated with these interventions are unclear.
Therefore, in dia - betic patients with dyslipidemia, active lifestyle modifications are considered to clearly outweigh the risks, given their proven benefits in such cases. Level of evidence The analysis included a systemic review of RCTs [477,479,495] and Kearney et al.’s [483] description of 14 RCTs.Kearney et al.’s [483] review included only 14 RCTs involving 1,466 pa - tients with T1DM and 17,220 patients with T2DM.They uti - lized various databases, suggesting a sufficiently systematic search, and predefined selection criteria.However, their review did not include judgments on the exclusion of individual stud - ies or assessments of bias risks in the studies included.Consid - ering this, the level of evidence was assessed as ‘RCT, ’ and given Recommendation 13.6 Active lifestyle modification is recom - mended for lipid management, with adherenece monitored.
[Ran - domized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 13.7 If the LDL-C target level is not achieved, pharmacological therapy is initiated: Recommendation 13. 7-1) Statins should be the first-line therapy.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea625 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgthat the benefits of the recommendations outweigh the risks, the recommendation grade was evaluated as ‘general recom - mendation.’ Lipid management in diabetes is summarized in Fig.4.Benefits In studies targeting diabetic patients, statin therapy showed significant effects in both primary and secondary prevention of CVDs.A prominent example of primary prevention study using statins in T2DM patients is the Collaborative Atorvas - tatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) [496].
In this study, targeting T2DM patients aged 40 to 75 with one or more cardiovascular risk factors, administration of atorvastatin 10 mg resulted in a 39% reduction in mean LDL-C to 72 mg/dL compared to base - line and a 37% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. Representative studies demonstrating the secondary preven - tion effects of statin therapy in T2DM patients with a history of CVDs include the Treating to New Targets (TNT) and Pravas - tatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Trial (PROVE- IT).In these studies, maintaining LDL-C at 57 to 77 mg/dL by administering atorvastatin 80 mg resulted in a significant re - duction in cardiovascular events compared to maintaining it at 81 to 99 mg/dL with low-dose statin therapy [477,479].
Meta- analysis also showed that statin therapy in diabetic patients re - duced the occurrence of cardiovascular events by up to 23% over 5 years when LDL-C was lowered by 1 mmol/L (38 mg/ dL), regardless of baseline LDL-C levels or patient characteris - tics [483]. The benefits of statin therapy in this meta-analysis were similar in T1DM and T2DM.Risks 1) Hepatotoxicity A mild alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations occurs in 0.5% to 2.0% of cases, more commonly when using high-in - tensity or high-dose statins [497].The use of statins does not worsen liver disease in patients with mild elevation of amino - transferases due to hepatic steatosis [498].2) Myotoxicity Among patients taking statins, there are cases where 10% to 15% complain of muscle pain, weakness, etc., and discontinue statin therapy [499].The frequency of statin-induced muscle damage is reported to be 0.01% higher compared to control groups [500].
The most severe form is rhabdomyolysis, with a reported frequency of 13 per 100,000 person-years [501]. In cases of rhabdomyolysis, creatine kinase levels typically in - crease more than 10 times the normal range.3) Diabetes Statin use has been linked to hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes [500,502].The new-onset diabetes during statin use is more common among older adults and those with risk factors such as high fasting blood glucose, obe - sity, or insulin resistance [503].A meta-analysis of 13 RCTs with 91,140 participants showed a RR of 1.09 for new-onset di - abetes during statin use.This means that for every 255 patients treated with statins over 4 years, one additional case of diabetes occurred, but 5.4 cases of vascular events were prevented [502].4) Contraindication during pregnancy Statins are categorized as Pregnancy Category X by the U.S.FDA and are contraindicated during pregnancy.
A systematic review of 16 clinical studies on statin exposure during pregnan - cy did not show an increased risk of congenital anomalies in observational studies, although case series have reported con - genital abnormalities [503]. However, due to insufficient data, statins should not be used in women who are pregnant or plan - ning pregnancy.Balancing the risks and benefits The cardiovascular preventive benefits of statin therapy in dia - betic patients have been well demonstrated through RCTs for primary and secondary prevention.While statin-induced dia - betes has been reported, the preventive effects of statins are clear in populations at risk of CVDs.Therefore, even if diabetes occurs after statin use, continuing statin therapy while initiat - ing diabetes treatment is beneficial for CVD prevention rather than discontinuing statins.
Alternatives and considerations During statin use, a significant increase is defined as ALT levels rising to more than three times the upper limit of normal on two consecutive occasions. In such cases, discontinuation of the medication is recommended, and once the levels normal - ize, restarting with a low dose or trying a different medication is an option.If muscle pain, stiffness, weakness, or general fa - tigue occur during statin use, measuring muscle enzymes to assess for muscle damage is recommended.If rhabdomyolysis occurs, statin use should be discontinued.Moon JS, et al.626 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgLevel of evidence The studies included in the analysis of the effects of statin and ezetimibe combination therapy on CVD in diabetic patients consist of a RCT targeting patients with acute coronary syn - drome [484], a subgroup analysis of diabetic patients from this study [504], and a systematic review of seven RCTs [487].
The systematic literature review by Hong et al. [487] included 28,191 participants from seven RCTs, indicating thorough and systematic searches were conducted using various databases.Selection criteria were predefined; however, judgments on the exclusion of individual studies or assessments of bias risks in the included studies were not included.Consequently, the level of evidence for the combination of statin plus ezetimibe is clas - sified as ‘RCT, ’ and as the recommendation benefits do not ap - ply to all cases, the recommendation grade is evaluated as ‘lim - ited recommendation.’ Benefits 1) Statin and ezetimibe combination Combining statin with ezetimibe can lower LDL-C by an addi - tional 15.20% compared to statin alone [505,506].A promi - nent study demonstrating the reduction in cardiovascular events with statin and ezetimibe combination therapy is IM - PROVE-IT.This study targeted 18,144 patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome within 10 days of admission.
In the group receiving statin and ezetimibe combination therapy, LDL-C was 15.8 mg/dL lower than in the statin alone group, and there was a 6.4% reduction in RR of cardiovascular events [484]. Subgroup analysis showed a 14% reduction in RR of car - diovascular events in diabetic patients, indicating a better pre - ventive effect against cardiovascular events in diabetic patients [504].There is currently no RCT specifically targeting diabetic pa - tients without CVD to assess the combination effects of statin and ezetimibe.However, in a meta-analysis of seven RCTs tar - geting patient groups such as stable angina, acute coronary syn - drome, CKD, and peripheral vascular disease, the risk of CVD decreased by 11% in the diabetic patient group.
The effect was even more favorable compared to non-diabetic groups [487].2) Combination therapy of statin with omega-3 or fibrate In addition to ezetimibe, studies have investigated the combi - nation therapy of statin with omega-3 fatty acids or fibrates, but these combination therapies have yet to show clear bene - fits. Results from studies aiming to assess the preventive effects of omega-3 fatty acids on CVD need to be more are consistent.In the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA Interven - tion Trial (REDUCE-IT), combination therapy with a statin and eicosapentaenoic acid, one of the omega-3 fatty acids, demonstrated a preventive effect on CVD [202].In this study, adding 4 g of icosapent ethyl to patients with hypertriglyceri - demia already taking a statin resulted in a 25% reduction in CVD risk compared to statin monotherapy.The same effect was observed in the subgroup analysis focusing on diabetic pa - tients.
However, in the Outcomes Study to Assess STatin Re - sidual Risk Reduction With EpaNova in HiGh CV Risk Pa - tienTs With Hypertriglyceridemia (STRENGTH) study, which included 70% diabetic patients, combination therapy with a statin and 4 g of omega-3 fatty acids did not show efficacy in preventing CVD [507]. There is debate regarding whether combination therapy of statin and fibrate to lower triglycerides and raise HDL-C is beneficial for T2DM patients.In the ACCORD study, combi - nation therapy of statin and fibrate failed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events compared to statin monotherapy.How - ever, subgroup analysis indicated the potential for CVD pre - vention in groups with typical diabetic dyslipidemia (triglycer - ides ≥204 mg/dL and HDL-C <34 mg/dL) [508].Similar re - sults were observed in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study [509,510].
However, in the most recent Pemafibrate to Reduce Cardiovascular Out - comes by Reducing Triglycerides in Patients with Diabetes (PROMINENT) study, treatment with pemafibrate in T2DM patients with dyslipidemia (95.7% were already taking statins) significantly improved lipid profiles, including triglyceride lev - els, but did not reduce the risk of CVD. This suggests limita - tions in reducing residual CVD risk with fibrate-induced tri - glyceride reduction.Risks The benefits of combining statin with ezetimibe need to be clari - fied.In RCTs, there was no difference in adverse reactions such as liver function abnormalities, muscle symptoms, and inci - dence of diabetes between statin monotherapy and combination therapy of statin and ezetimibe [484,487,504-506].Combina -Recommendation 13.7-2) If the target is not achieved with the maximum statin dose, ezetimibe should be added.
[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea627 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgtion therapy of statin and ezetimibe is associated with increased costs compared to statin monotherapy. Balancing the risks and benefits In diabetic patients with CVD who have not reached their tar - get levels with statin monotherapy, the preventive benefits of adding ezetimibe have been confirmed through RCTs.It has been demonstrated that adding ezetimibe to statin therapy helps achieve target levels in diabetic patients without CVD who have not reached their goals with statin monotherapy, and this is expected to be beneficial for CVD prevention.Alternatives and considerations If the target LDL-C levels are not reached with statin mono - therapy, considering the addition of ezetimibe, which incurs minimal cost increase, is prioritized.
Level of evidence Studies analyzing the effects of combination therapy with statins and PCSK9 inhibitors on CVD included RCTs targeting patients with CVD [485,486], subgroup analysis results of dia - betic patients from these studies [488,489], and a systematic lit - erature review including 39 RCTs [511]. The systematic litera - ture review appears to have been conducted systematically us - ing various databases, with predefined selection criteria; how - ever, it did not include judgments on the exclusion of individual studies or assessments of bias risks in the included studies.Combining these findings, the evidence level is ‘RCT, ’ and as the recommendation benefits do not apply to all cases, the rec - ommendation grade is evaluated as ‘limited recommendation.
’ Benefits In patients at high risk of CVD who are already using statins at maximum tolerated doses, or in T2DM patients, adding PCSK9 inhibitors such as evolocumab or alirocumab resulted in an additional reduction of LDL-C by 36% to 59% [512-514]. In the FOURIER study, which included 27,564 patients with CVD, adding evolocumab to statins led to a 59% reduction in LDL-C and a 15% reduction in the RR of CVD over the 2.2- year study period [485].A subgroup analysis of 11,031 diabetic patients in this study showed similar results [488].The ODYS - SEY OUTCOMES study, involving 18,924 individuals with a recent acute coronary syndrome, showed that adding ali - rocumab to statins significantly reduced the risk of CVDs by 15% over 2.8 years [486].Similar results were also observed in a subgroup analysis targeting diabetic patients [483].
In a sys - tematic literature review of 39 RCTs involving 66,478 partici - pants, the PCSK9 inhibitor group showed no difference in overall mortality compared to the control group, but the risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revasculariza - tion were significantly lower [511]. Risks The risks of combination therapy of statin and PCSK9 inhibi - tor are not clear.In RCTs, there was no difference in adverse reactions such as liver function abnormalities, muscle symp - toms, cognitive function, or incidence of diabetes when com - pared to statin monotherapy [485,486,511].However, combi - nation therapy with statins and PCSK9 inhibitors is associated with increased costs compared to statin monotherapy, and es - pecially when compared to combination therapy with statins and ezetimibe, the cost increase is much more significant.
Balancing the risks and benefits In diabetic patients with CVD who have not reached their tar - get levels with statin monotherapy, the CVD prevention bene - fits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors in therapy have been con - firmed through RCTs. While there is an increase in costs with combination therapy with PCSK9 inhibitors, it is judged that the benefits of combination therapy clearly outweigh the risks.Alternatives and considerations Currently, if LDL-C targets are not achieved with statins alone, consideration should be given to adding of a PCSK9 inhibitor, but only after an attempt has been made with ezetimibe.Recommendation 13.7-3) In diabetic patients with CVD who do not achieve the target after adding ezetimibe, combination therapy with statins and PCSK9 inhibitors should be considered.
[Random - ized controlled trial, limited recommendation] Recommendation 13.8 For severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycer - ide levels ≥150 mg/dL), primary treatment should focus on lifestyle modification, including abstinence from alcohol, weight loss, and secondary factors such as glycemic control.
[Non-randomized con - trolled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 13.9 In cases of severe hypertriglyceridemia (tri - glyceride levels ≥500 mg/dL), pharmacological therapy with fenofi - brates, omega-3 fatty acids, etc., is initiated to reduce the risk of acute Moon JS, et al.628 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgAlthough there is much debate about whether hypertriglyceri - demia is a risk factor for CVD, there is consensus that hyper - triglyceridemia reflects the number of remnant lipoprotein particles, which are atherogenic factors other than LDL-C and is associated with an increase in small dense LDL particles, so the opinion that triglycerides are one of the risk factors for CVD is dominant [491,515].
Triglycerides are notably elevated in overweight, obese, have metabolic syndrome, or diabetic patients, and the 2001 ATP III guidelines suggested a cutoff of 150 mg/dL for diagnosing metabolic syndrome, recommend - ing it as a target for triglyceride control [493]. In the case of hypertriglyceridemia, it is necessary to check whether there are secondary causes that can increase triglycer - ides (such as weight gain, alcohol consumption, excessive car - bohydrate intake, CKD, diabetes, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, estrogen, tamoxifen, glucocorticoids, etc.) and genetic prob - lems that can cause abnormalities in lipid metabolism.Life - style modifications such as weight loss, increased physical ac -tivity, and MNT including abstinence are effective in treating hypertriglyceridemia and can reduce the risk factors for AS - CVD in some patients [516].If blood sugar is not controlled, hypertriglyceridemia worsens, and strict glycemic control can lower triglycerides.
If there are secondary causes, prioritize treatment for the cause. When triglyceride levels rise above 500 mg/dL, the risk of acute pancreatitis increases, so immediate drug therapy such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids may be considered along with a low-fat diet and abstinence to prevent acute pancreatitis.In cases where triglycerides are between 200 and 499 mg/dL, the primary treatment goal is the control of LDL-C according to cardiovascular risk, and lifestyle modifications and statin thera - py are recommended as initial treatments to lower LDL-C be - low the target.Even after achieving the target LDL-C through lifestyle modifications and statin therapy, if triglycerides are still above 200 mg/dL, drug therapy such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids may be considered.If single-drug therapy for triglyc - eride control does not reach the target level, combination ther - apy may be considered.pancreatitis.

’ Benefits The Anti-Thrombotic Trialists’ (ATT) study, which analyzed 16 secondary prevention studies involving over 17,000 indi - viduals, found a significant reduction in serious cardiovascular events in the aspirin group compared to the control group (6.7% vs. 8.2%, P<0.0001), with no difference observed based on gender.Additionally, there were fewer incidences of major coronary events (4.3% vs.5.3%, P<0.0001) and strokes (2.08% vs.2.54%, P=0.002) in the aspirin group [517].Risks In the ATT study, the occurrence of hemorrhagic strokes was slightly higher in the group using aspirin for secondary pre - vention but it was not statistically significant [517].Balancing the risks and benefits Administering aspirin for secondary prevention purposes yields greater benefits than risks.Therefore, it is recommended to use aspirin for secondary prevention in diabetic patients with a history of CVD.
Alternatives and considerations The administration of aspirin for secondary prevention pur - poses is considered to yield more significant benefits than risks; however, caution is necessary regarding the risk of bleed - ing. Recent studies have been actively exploring the use of oth -er antiplatelet agents besides aspirin or combination therapy with other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants.For diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome, the use of dual therapy combining aspirin with drugs like clopidogrel or ticagrelor tar - geting the P2Y12 receptor for a certain period has been shown in various studies to increase the risk of major bleeding but can reduce the risk of CVD [518-520].
Recently, in large-scale clin - ical trials, the combination of aspirin and a non-vitamin K an - tagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) called rivaroxaban is su - perior in preventing CVD compared to aspirin monotherapy for diabetic patients with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease who have a low risk of bleeding [521-524]. How - ever, while reducing overall mortality, this approach signifi - cantly increases the risk of bleeding, thus necessitating thor - ough consultation regarding both CVD prevention and bleed - ing risk before making a decision.Level of evidence The level of evidence was evaluated as ‘RCTs’ since multiple RCTs and one meta-analysis study were assessed.Benefits The Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events (CAPRIE) study assessed the efficacy of clopidogrel (75 mg) against aspirin (325 mg) among 19,185 individuals at high risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.
The study showed sig - 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea631 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgnificant secondary prevention benefits for both aspirin and clopidogrel. Notably, clopidogrel achieved a RR reduction in myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular disease-related death by 8.7% more than aspirin (annual incidence rate: 5.32% vs.5.83%, P=0.043) [525].Furthermore, a additional analysis of 3,866 diabetic patients showed that preventive effect of clop - idogrel on CVD was superior to that of aspirin (incidence rate: 15.6% vs.17.7%, P=0.042), indicating its potential as an alter - native to aspirin [525].In 2020, a meta-analysis involving 9,218 diabetic from six studies compared the secondary prevention effects of aspirin and clopidogrel and there were no differences in mortality rates, recurrent strokes, fatal cerebral infarctions, or risks of myocardial infarction between the two drugs [526].
Risks In the CAPRIE study, the risk of all bleeding was similar be - tween the aspirin and clopidogrel groups. However, incidences of GI bleeding (2.66% vs.1.99%, P<0.05) and non-fatal cere - bral hemorrhage (0.53% vs.0.39%, P<0.05) were significantly higher in the aspirin group [525].A subgroup analysis con - ducted in diabetic patients also showed a higher risk of bleed - ing in the aspirin group (2.8% vs.1.8%, P=0.031) [527].More - over, a meta-analysis examining the secondary prevention ef - fects of aspirin and clopidogrel in diabetic patients showed no difference in the risk of cerebral hemorrhage between the two drugs, with no analysis conducted for major or GI bleeding [526].Balancing the risks and benefits In diabetic patients, the use of aspirin and clopidogrel has been confirmed to have secondary prevention effects for CVDs.
Es - pecially, clopidogrel showed similar or better secondary pre - vention effects for CVDs compared to aspirin, and there was no difference in the risk of bleeding. Therefore, when aspirin is contraindicated or not tolerated, the benefits of using clopido - grel outweigh the potential harms.Alternatives and considerations Aspirin resistance can occur due to multiple alternative path - ways that act independently of thromboxane A2 in the platelet activation process, and it is more prevalent among diabetic pa - tients [528].A study of 1,045 diabetic patients from 11 hospi - tals in Korea also showed that 9.8% of patients exhibited aspi - rin resistance [529].Considering this situation, the adminis - tration of other antiplatelet agents, such as clopidogrel, may be an alternative.Level of evidence Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses evaluating them were as - sessed, including high-quality, well-planned studies targeting diabetic patients specifically.
Therefore, the level of evidence was evaluated as ‘RCT. ’ Benefits The ATT study conducted a meta-analysis of six clinical trials examining the primary prevention effects of aspirin, involving approximately 4,000 diabetic patients out of 95,000 partici - pants, and there was no difference in outcomes between diabet - ics and non-diabetics groups.The use of aspirin (75 to 500 mg) was associated with a 12% reduction in the incidence of overall cardiovascular events and a 23% reduction in non-fatal myo - cardial infarctions.However, the effects on cardiovascular death and stroke were minimal, with cardiovascular events re - duced only in men and strokes reduced only in women [517].The Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis with Aspi - rin for Diabetes (JPAD) study aimed to observe the primary prevention effects of aspirin (81 to 100 mg daily) in 2,539 Japa - nese diabetic patients aged 30 to 85 years.
Although no reduc - tion in CVD risk with aspirin use was observed (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.10; P=0.16), there was a significant reduction in patients aged 65 and older (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.99) [530]. Recently, a series of large-scale clinical studies on the pri - mary prevention effects of aspirin have been published.The A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes (ASCEND) study observed the effects of aspirin over 7.4 years in 15,480 diabetic patients aged 40 and older in the United Kingdom.The group using low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily) had a 12% lower inci - dence of serious vascular events compared to the control group (8.5% vs.9.6%, P=0.01) [531].
In the Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events (ARRIVE) study, which observed the primary prevention effects of aspirin in men aged 55 and older and women aged 60 and older with moderate cardiovascular risk but no history of diabetes or coronary artery disease and not at high risk of bleeding, no significant preventive effects on major cardiovascular events were [532]. Similarly, in the Aspi -Recommendation 14.3 Aspirin (100 mg/day) can be used as a primary prevention strategy for adult diabetic patients with a high risk of CVD, but a low risk of bleeding.
[Randomized controlled tri - al, limited recommendation] Moon JS, et al.632 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgrin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study, which tracked the effects of low-dose aspirin on primary prevention of cardiovascular events in individuals aged 70 and older resid - ing in the United States and Australia for 4.7 years, aspirin did not significantly reduce cardiovascular events (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.08). Among the participants, 11% had diabetes, and there was no difference in outcomes based on diabetes sta - tus [533].In 2019, a meta-analysis based on 13 clinical trials, including recent large-scale studies such as ASCEND, ARRIVE, and ASPREE, was published.It analyzed 164,225 individuals with - out a history of CVD, of whom 19% (30,360 individuals) were diabetic patients.
In the aspirin group, the risk of all cardiovas - cular events, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke de - creased by 11%, 15%, and 19%, respectively, but there was no difference in cardiovascular mortality and overall mortality rates. However, subgroup analysis targeting diabetic patients only showed a 10% reduction in the efficacy variable of cardio - vascular risk, with no difference in other risks [534].Further - more, another meta-analysis conducted exclusively on diabetic patients analyzed 33,679 individuals from 10 studies.The ad - ministration of aspirin did not reduce the risk of major cardio - vascular events, overall mortality, mortality associated with antiplatelet use in CVD, myocardial infarction, or stroke [535].
Recent meta-analysis results, focusing on 34,069 diabetic pa - tients from 10 studies and analyzed based on baseline cardio - vascular risk, showed no risk reduction in the low-risk group but a 12% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events in the moderate/high-risk group [536]. Risks In the ATT study, the use of aspirin for primary prevention was associated with an increased incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.75; P=0.01), and although there were also numerous occurrences of major bleeding ex - cluding intracranial hemorrhage (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.82; P=0.03), most were non-fatal [517].In the primary re - sults of the JPAD study, there was no difference in bleeding risk between the low-dose aspirin group and the non-user group [529].However, in the 10-year follow-up study pub - lished in 2017, there was no significant reduction in cardiovas - cular risk or increase in hemorrhagic stroke in the aspirin group.
On the contrary, GI bleeding significantly increased compared to the non-user group (2% vs. 0.9%, P=0.03) [537].In the ASCEND study targeting diabetic patients, major bleed - ing events increased by 29% (4.1% vs.3.2%, P=0.003), indicat - ing a higher bleeding risk than the preventive effect on CVD [530].Furthermore, in the ARRIVE study, the bleeding risk was 2.11 times higher in the aspirin group (95% CI, 1.36 to 3.28; P=0.0007), and in the ASPREE study targeting individu - als aged 70 and older, the risk of major bleeding increased by 1.38 times (95% CI, 1.18 to 1.62; P<0.001) [532].In a retro - spective cohort study based on data from the National Health Insurance Service in Korea from 2005 to 2009, the effect of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of ischemic stroke in diabetic patients aged 40 and older was analyzed.
The use of low-dose aspirin (75 to 162 mg/day) actually increased the risk of hospitalization due to ischemic stroke by 1.73 times, and additional analysis on patients followed for more than 1 year showed a further increase in risk to 1.97 times [538]. A meta- analysis published in 2019 revealed that the use of aspirin in - creased the risk of major bleeding by 1.43 times, particularly significantly increasing the risk of major GI bleeding by 1.56 times.Subgroup analysis in diabetic patients showed a 1.29 times higher risk of major bleeding and a 1.35 times higher risk of major GI bleeding [534].Other meta-analysis results, including only diabetic patients, also showed increases in the risk of major bleeding by 1.29 and 1.38 times, respectively [535,536].Balancing the risks and benefits The use of aspirin for primary prevention in individuals with diabetes should be carefully considered, balancing the cardio - vascular benefits against the risk of bleeding.
According to re - cent studies, aspirin use may lead to more adverse events than benefits in individuals over 70 years of age and those with a low cardiovascular risk. As of 2023, the ADA recommends as - pirin for primary prevention in individuals with diabetes aged 50 years and older without a history of vascular disease who have at least one additional risk factor: a family history of pre - mature ASCVD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, CKD, or albuminuria, and who are not at high risk for bleeding.The decision to use aspirin should be based on a thorough discus - sion about its potential for CVD prevention and the risk of bleeding [472].2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea633 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.org15.HYPOGLYCEMIA MANAGEMENT 1.

[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Level of evidence The recommendation for treating hypoglycemia is based on expert opinion, thereby classifying the level of evidence as an ‘expert opinion. ’ Given that the benefits of this recommenda - tion significantly outweigh the risks, it is categorized as a ‘gen - eral recommendation.’ Benefits The goal of treating hypoglycemia is quickly detecting and ad - dressing low blood glucose to alleviate symptoms and prevent potential damage.Prompt and correct responses to hypoglyce - mic episodes can help avoid serious complications, such as car - diovascular and cerebrovascular issues.The initial step in re - sponding to a hypoglycemia event is to consume simple sugars, specifically glucose, to elevate blood glucose levels quickly.A dose of 0.3 g of monosaccharide per kilogram of body weight is recommended during such an event.
However, for individuals who are overweight, consuming this proportionate amount poses a risk of ingesting excessive carbohydrates. Thus, experts generally advise ingesting a fixed amount of 15 to 20 g of glu - Moon JS, et al.634 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgRecommendation 15.4 To facilitate the restoration of impaired hypoglycemia awareness, individuals who have experienced SH should be cautioned to exercise vigilance against hypoglycemic episodes for a duration spanning weeks to months.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation]cose or carbohydrate foods of equivalent glucose content.One gram of glucose can raise blood glucose by about 3 mg/dL, and 15 to 20 g of simple sugars can raise blood glucose by about 45 to 60 mg/dL in 20 minutes, typically relieving symptoms.
How - ever, hypoglycemia can occur repeatedly, even after recovery from a previous episode, because hypoglycemic events can lower the body’s glucose threshold and weaken the defense sys - tem. Additionally, the effects of insulin or insulin secretagogues may persist post-recovery.Continuous blood glucose monitor - ing and snacking or eating meals are crucial to prevent recur - rence.In severe cases of hypoglycemia, where self-treatment is not possible, seeking emergency medical assistance for intrave - nous glucose administration of 10 to 25 g over a few minutes is necessary.Risks Overtreatment of hypoglycemia should be avoided to prevent rebound hyperglycemia and potential weight gain.However, high-level evidence-based clinical studies that examine the po - tential harms of overtreatment of hypoglycemia are currently lacking.
Balancing the benefits and risks The recommendations for managing hypoglycemia are sug - gested by experts and have been used internationally for years among people with diabetes. For SH, particularly when indi - viduals are unconscious or incapable of self-care, the treatment approach is specifically tailored to each stage of hypoglycemia to avoid inappropriate treatment, which could result in more significant harm, such as aspiration or delayed treatment.To diminish the risk of overtreatment and the consequent rebound hyperglycemia, it is essential to frequently monitor blood glu - cose levels, continuing even after recovery from a hypoglycemic episode.Alternatives and considerations Hypoglycemia, defined by low blood glucose levels that can harm an individual, has widely debated thresholds.
Conduct - ing high-quality studies on the definition and treatment of hy - poglycemia presents ethical challenges, especially involving in - dividuals at high risk for hypoglycemia who are in fragile health states. Historically, hypoglycemia has been defined as blood glucose levels less than 70 mg/dL [539], a threshold based on studies indicating the onset of counter-regulatory hormone secretion below this level.However, the validity of the 70 mg/dL criterion as a hypoglycemic threshold is contest - ed, as such levels can occur during physiological fasting.Medi - cation-treated individuals might experience a lower threshold due to greater exposure to levels below 70 mg/dL compared to the general population [540].Significantly, blood glucose levels below 54 mg/dL are unlikely in the absence of impaired hypo - glycemic defenses and are associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and mortality [541-543].
Consequent - ly, an additional hypoglycemia level, defined as blood glucose below 54 mg/dL, has been recognized, leading to the classifica - tion into three levels: ‘hypoglycemia alert value, ’ ‘clinically sig - nificant hypoglycemia, ’ and ‘SH. ’ Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include feelings of thrill, anxiety, confusion, palpitations, and hunger.However, in in - stances of IAH, symptoms may not be present.Conversely, in - dividuals with consistently high blood glucose levels may ex - perience hypoglycemic symptoms even when their blood glu - cose is within the normal range.Dysregulation of counter-reg - ulatory hormones or IAH, where the defense against hypogly - cemia breaks down, can lead to severe consequences, such as loss of consciousness, seizures, coma, and even death, without warning signs of hypoglycemia.The occurrence of hypoglyce - mia during activities like driving or operating machinery could lead to severe accidents.
Treatments high in fat, like chocolate or ice cream, are unsuitable for correcting hypogly - cemia because they are absorbed too slowly to raise blood sug - ar levels effectively. In Korea, glucagon kits for treating SH are available through the Korea Center for Rare and Essential Drugs.For those experiencing frequent hypoglycemic epi - sodes or at high risk for SH, having a glucagon kit at home for emergency use is advisable, and caregivers should be trained to administer it if necessary.Level of evidence A systematic literature review to identify studies focused on the treatment and prognosis of individuals suffering from IAH or SH was evaluated.The analysis incorporated one meta- analysis [544], three RCTs [260,545,546], and two expert opin - ions [547,548] regarding recovery from IAH.
The majority of 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea635 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgresearch in this field has been centered on individuals with T1DM, with comparatively fewer studies addressing those with T2DM. This discrepancy is attributed to the elevated risk associated with T2DM due to factors like age, duration of dia - betes, and the presence of comorbidities.As a result, there are fewer high-quality clinical studies in this population.The stud - ies we analyzed ranged from moderate to high quality, pre - dominantly RCTs.Hence, the evidence level is classified as a ‘RCT.’ Given that the benefits of the treatments and interven - tions discussed outweigh the risks, the recommendation level is considered a ‘general recommendation.
’ Benefits After a severe hypoglycemic event, the body’s threshold for de - tecting hypoglycemia decreases, potentially requiring weeks to months of avoiding hypoglycemia to reverse autonomic failure related to hypoglycemia [549]. Various studies have explored the effectiveness of educational, pharmacologic, and techno - logical interventions in reversing IAH.In a follow-up analysis of the DAFNE clinical study, systematic education, including blood glucose monitoring and medication adjustment over 5 days, was conducted for patients with IAH to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.This intervention decreased the risk of SH over a 12-month follow-up [548].Additionally, the DAFNEplus study, which incorporated behavioral changes into the tradi - tional educational framework, further enhanced its effective - ness.Moreover, a meta-analysis of eight studies found that structured educational programs significantly reduced the risk of SH in those with IAH.
Given the association between SH, IAH, and increased risks of CVD, cognitive dysfunction, and mortality, it is crucial for those with IAH or a history of SH to take proactive measures to prevent further episodes. Health - care professionals play a vital role in delivering targeted, struc - tured education to aid individuals in recovering from IAH and prevent future hypoglycemic events.Risks No studies have been published that evaluate the effectiveness of increasing glycemic targets to prevent recurrent SH, cardio - vascular events, and death in individuals with diabetes who have previously experienced SH.As a result, there is no con - crete evidence indicating harm from adjusting glycemic targets upwards.
However, the potential for harm due to hyperglyce - mia exists, particularly in individuals with severe glycemic fluctuations when glycemic control targets are elevated.Balancing the benefits and risks Individuals with diabetes who suffer from SH are at a height - ened risk for CVD and mortality. IAH and recurrent SH are key risk factors for these adverse outcomes, highlighting the importance of preventing such episodes.Given the lack of ex - tensive research on the adverse effects of increasing glycemic targets, the primary focus should be on preventing life-threat - ening hypoglycemia in those at high risk for IAH and SH.Epi - sodes of SH necessitate medical attention, contributing to high - er healthcare costs.Moreover, individuals with significant gly - cemic fluctuations face a risk of pronounced hyperglycemia if their glycemic targets are elevated for extended periods.
Conse - quently, the decision to adjust glycemic targets upwards should be tailored and closely monitored, considering each individual’s specific health profile. Alternatives and considerations Individuals who have experienced SH or have IAH are at an in - creased risk of recurrent hypoglycemic episodes, potentially leading to a compromised hypoglycemic defense mechanism and a cycle of repeated episodes.Recovery from such condi - tions is achievable, typically necessitating a period of 2 to 3 weeks without any hypoglycemic events, although it may take several months in some cases.This underscores the importance of preventing recurrence during this critical recovery phase.For those with T1DM experiencing IAH, frequent recurrent hypoglycemia, or SH, the use of insulin pumps and CGM sys - tems is advised (refer to section ‘Pharmacologic therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus’).
It is important to individualize glyce - mic control goals, educate individuals and caregivers about hy - poglycemia, and actively monitor glycemic levels while adjust - ing the type and dose of hypoglycemic agents to prevent hypo - glycemia. Recently, it has been suggested to raise glycemic tar - gets in individuals at risk for hypoglycemia, even if they have not experienced IAH or SH.For those particularly susceptible to hypoglycemia, such as the elderly, underweight, those with renal dysfunction, or individuals with chronic or severe medi - cal conditions, glycemic targets should be customized, aiming for an HbA1c level between 7.5% and 9.0%.Recommendation 15.5 Individuals with recurrent SH, the use of a rtCGM device is recommended.
[Randomized controlled trial, lim - ited recommendation] Moon JS, et al.636 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgLevel of evidence The analysis encompassed one RCT focusing on the primary outcome of HbA1c reduction in adults with T1DM, two RCTs targeting adults with T2DM [550,551], and one meta-analysis [552]. These studies, comprising systematic reviews and RCTs, were identified as being of moderate to high quality.Conse - quently, their evidence level was classified as ‘RCTs, ’ and the recommendations derived from these studies were categorized as ‘general recommendations, ’ given that the anticipated bene - fits significantly outweighed any associated risks.Benefits In 2018, Heinemann et al.[553] conducted a study reporting a significant 72% reduction in hypoglycemia incidence among individuals with T1DM and IAH using rtCGM, without nota - ble device-related adverse events.
Similar positive outcomes for glycemic control in T1DM using CGM have been observed in other studies [550]. For individuals with T2DM on multiple insulin regimens, one study highlighted CGM’s role in de - creasing SH instances [551].Conversely, another investigation indicated that while rtCGM improved glycemic control for T2DM, it did not significantly affect hypoglycemia event re - duction.These findings underscore the necessity for further investigation into rtCGM’s efficacy for T2DM (refer to section ‘Continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps’).Risks Aside from insertable continuous glucose monitors, the major - ity of CGM devices adhere to the skin, potentially causing con - tact dermatitis.Moreover, employing rtCGM to enhance IAH and mitigate SH risks necessitates extra resources, encompass - ing both the expenses associated with the devices and the need for trained personnel.
Balancing the benefits and risks The advantages of using a rtCGM for managing recurrent epi - sodes of SH significantly outweigh the potential risks. Unman - aged episodes can escalate into further cardiovascular and cognitive dysfunction, along with increased medical costs.Hence, the recommendation is to employ CGM for individuals who experience recurrent SH.Level of evidence The analysis encompassed two systematic reviews [554,555], two follow-up analyses of RCTs [556,557], and five observa - tional studies [558-562].Meta-analyses and RCTs were chosen to explore T1DM, while follow-up analyses of RCTs and ob - servational studies were selected for T2DM due to the lack of high-quality meta-analyses or RCTs for this group.The link between hypoglycemia and cognitive dysfunction is particu - larly pronounced at both younger and older ages for T1DM and mainly at older ages for T2DM [555].The studies on T2DM include research conducted in Korea [559].
The result - ing recommendations are primarily aimed at elderly individu - als with T2DM. Due to the incorporation of studies not deemed high quality for T2DM, the evidence was classified as ‘non-RCTs.’ Furthermore, the recommendation was labeled as a ‘general recommendation’ based on the assessment that the benefits of following it substantially outweigh the risks.Benefits The ADV ANCE study revealed that individuals with cognitive decline faced over twice the risk of SH (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.14 to 3.87) [556], while a follow-up analysis of the the Memory in Diabetes substudy of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD-MIND) study indicated that cog - nitive dysfunction was linked to a 13% increased risk of SH [557].
Observational studies, including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort study [560] and the Ed - inburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study [558], have documented that individuals who experience SH in T2DM are at a heightened risk for future cognitive dysfunction and dementia. In contrast, for T1DM, a systematic review of 61 studies demonstrated an association between hypoglycemia and cognitive dysfunction in individuals younger than 10 and older than 55 years [555].Interestingly, adolescents through to middle-aged individuals in this group appeared more resilient to neuroglycopenia.The DCCT study, focusing on adolescents and middle-aged partic - ipants with T1DM, found no cognitive function differences despite more frequent SH in those receiving intensive treat - ment [563].
In Korea, a retrospective study using Korean National Health Insurance Service data analyzed the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia in individuals with T2DM who experi -Recommendation 15.6 When caring for individuals at high risk for hypoglycemia, it is suggested to carefully identify and regularly assess changes in cognitive function. [Non-randomized controlled study, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea637 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgenced hypoglycemia, uncovering an increased risk compared to those without hypoglycemia episodes [559].In addition, Ko - rean studies have shown an increase in mortality and the inci - dence of acute cardiovascular events in individuals with diabe - tes and SH, not only in those with cognitive decline but also in those with cardiac decline, especially in individuals with T2DM [564].
These findings suggest that individuals with diabetes should be more vigilant regarding the occurrence of hypoglyce - mia and strive to prevent it by periodically evaluating cardiac function. Risks In the studies included in the analysis, no adverse effects were reported in relation to the advisories.Balancing the benefits and risks From the studies included in the analysis, it can be observed that hypoglycemia and cognitive dysfunction have a bidirec - tional influence on each other.Cognitive dysfunction weakens the body’s defense system against hypoglycemia, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, while the occurrence of hypoglycemia induces neuroglycopenia in the brain, causing short-term cog - nitive dysfunction and leading to long-term cognitive decline.
In other words, cognitive dysfunction is a strong risk factor for the occurrence of hypoglycemia, making patients with im - paired cognitive functions more susceptible to hypoglycemia and increasing the risk of severe cognitive impairments, such as dementia. Given these findings, it is crucial for healthcare pro - viders and caregivers to regularly assess cognitive function in individuals with known or suspected cognitive decline and to educate them on preventing hypoglycemia.In the case of T1DM, particular attention should be paid to younger and old - er individuals who are more susceptible to cognitive impair - ments stemming from hypoglycemia.As such, monitoring for changes in cognitive function is especially crucial in these de - mographics, particularly after episodes of frequent hypoglyce - mia.This recommendation does not present a specific risk.Alternatives and considerations Standardized assessments suitable for clinical use should also be identified.
Among the studies analyzed, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is one tool that can be utilized in clinical settings to determine cognitive function through sim - ple questions objectively. However, additional evidence and discussion are required to recommend an appropriate tool for widespread use in assessing cognitive function in older adults with diabetes.Level of evidence The analysis encompassed one systematic review and four RCTs.High-quality studies on the effect of systematic educa - tion on managing hypoglycemia have primarily been conduct - ed in individuals with T1DM, aiming to improve IAH.Studies in T2DM are limited; however, an RCT was conducted in Ko - rea to investigate the potential benefits of systematic education in improving hypoglycemia management among individuals with T2DM [561].The studies analyzed were generally well- designed and executed, with a quality ranging from moderate to high.
The studies included in this review were generally well-structured and implemented, exhibiting moderate to high quality. The collective evidence was thus categorized under the ‘RCT’ level, and the recommendation’s scope was classified as ‘general recommendation’ because the benefits of the recom - mendation outweigh the potential harms.Benefits The significance of systematic education in diabetes self-man - agement is widely acknowledged, with research primarily fo - cusing on individuals with T1DM.These structured education programs cover essential aspects of diabetes care, including es - tablishing glycemic targets, medication dosage adjustments, and carbohydrate intake calculations.Among studies evaluat - ing the educational impact, one study on the effect on hypogly - cemia was incorporated into the analysis.
Programs such as HypoCOMPaSS, DAFNE, and HyPOS have demonstrated success in enhancing hypoglycemia awareness and reducing the occurrence of severe hypoglycemic episodes in individuals with T1DM, with these outcomes being highlighted in prior recommendations [260,548,565]. A systematic review involv - ing 14 studies, including these programs, found that eight studies reported a decrease in hypoglycemic episodes among participants who received systematic education.Moreover, three of these studies highlighted that combining systematic education with medication adjustments and technological in - terventions could effectively prevent hypoglycemia [566].Recommendation 15.7 During each visit, clinicians should screen individuals for the risk of hypoglycemia and provide comprehen - sive education on prevention and treatment to those identified as high risk.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.638 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgConversely, there are fewer high-evidence-level studies con - cerning the impact of education on hypoglycemia manage - ment in individuals with T2DM. An RCT conducted at a Ko - rean university hospital assessed the effect of systematic educa - tion on managing hypoglycemia in individuals with T2DM treated with insulin or sulfonylureas.This study revealed that the intervention group exhibited improved hypoglycemia-re - lated symptoms compared to the control group over 6 months following the education [567].Risks There are no harms associated with this recommendation.Balancing the benefits and risks Healthcare providers are advised to routinely question individ - uals with diabetes about any occurrences of hypoglycemia during visits, pinpoint potential risk factors, and proactively identify those at heightened risk.
For individuals deemed at high risk, delivering tailored education on hypoglycemia pre - vention is essential, along with necessary adjustments in glyce - mic targets and the type and dosage of hypoglycemic medica - tions. High-risk individuals must be informed about hypogly - cemia’s nature, symptoms, causes, and the steps to take if it happens.Achieving a balance between carbohydrate con - sumption, physical activity, and medication is crucial for hypo - glycemia prevention.Education on managing these elements to avert hypoglycemia should be provided consistently and in a manner that is practical for individuals to implement.This recommendation is not associated with any specific adverse ef - fects.Level of evidence The analysis encompassed two non-RCTs [568,569] and two RCTs [570,571].
The randomized trials focused on assessing the effectiveness of questionnaires or visual analog scales in diag - nosing IAH, while the non-randomized trials compared these diagnostic methods directly for IAH. Most of the studies ana - lyzed were of moderate to high quality, well-designed, and well- conducted.Given the nature of the studies, the collective evi - dence was categorized under ‘non-RCTs’ for evidence level.Due to the benefits of the diagnostic recommendations sur - passing the potential risks, the overall recommendation was given a ‘general recommendation’ status.Benefits Well-validated tools for assessing IAH include the GOLD score [570] and the Clarke score [571].Both tools employ question - naires to measure the frequency with which an individual no - tices symptoms of hypoglycemia and to document the actual blood glucose level at the time these symptoms occur.
A score of 4 or higher on either assessment is considered indicative of IAH, with both tools demonstrating similar diagnostic rates for hypoglycemia unawareness [568]. Risks There are no harms associated with this recommendation.Balancing the benefits and risks For individuals with diabetes, particularly those on insulin or medications that may cause hypoglycemia, experiencing hypo - glycemia objectively during a clinical visit or through self- monitoring without noticing or reporting subjective autonom - ic symptoms is not uncommon.If IAH is confirmed, the im - plementation of education on the prevention and management of hypoglycemia, as discussed earlier, is essential to assist indi - viduals in recovering from hypoglycemia unawareness.Alternatives and considerations No notable differences were found in the rates at which hypo - glycemia was diagnosed using either the GOLD score or the Clarke score, suggesting both tools are equally effective for clinical use.
However, the Clarke score might provide a more precise reflection of an individual’s symptoms and hypoglyce - mia characteristics. Consequently, utilizing both diagnostic tools could enhance the reliability of identifying hypoglycemia compared to depending on a single method [569].Recommendation 15.8 Clinicians should utilize validated tools to assess hypoglycemia unawareness in patients exhibiting indicative symptoms.[Non-randomized controlled study, general recommen - dation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea639 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.org16.DIABETIC NEUROP ATHY AND FOOT CARE 1.All people with diabetes should be screened for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and autonomic neuropathy, starting at 5 years after diagnosis of T1DM and at the time of diagnosis of T2DM, and annually thereafter.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 2.
Screening for DPN should include the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument Questionnaire (MNSIQ) and neurological examination (tests for vibration perception, ankle reflex, 10-g monofilament, pin-prick sensation, and temperature sensation).

[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 6.For all individuals with diabetes, it is recommended to conduct an annual comprehensive assessment for risk factors of ulcers and amputa - tion, and provide education on foot care.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 7.Perform peripheral angiography in people with severe claudication, weak dorsal artery pulse, or an ankle-brachial index of ≤0.9.[Random - ized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 8.A multidisciplinary approach is required for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs).[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 16.1 All people with diabetes should be screened for DPN and autonomic neuropathy, starting at 5 years after diagnosis of T1DM and at the time of diagnosis of T2DM, and annually thereafter.
[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 16.2 Screening for DPN should include the MNSIQ and neurological examination (tests for vibration perception, ankle reflex, 10-g monofilament, pin-prick sensation, and temperature sensation). [Expert opinion, general recommendation] Background Diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication of dia - betes with a lifetime prevalence of 60% in both T1DM and T2DM, presenting with various symptoms, either locally or systemically [572-574].The fifth edition of ‘Diabetes’ by the KDA and the 2023 Standards of Care in Diabetes by the ADA recommend screenings for diabetic neuropathy in people with diabetes and conducting subsequent annual screening tests [572-574].The prevalence of diabetic neuropathy in Korea was 25% to 53%, according to a multicenter study conducted by the Diabetic Neuropathy Study Group of the KDA and data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) [575-577].
Early diagnosis and management of neu -ropathy in people with diabetes is essential for the following reasons [572-574]: (1) Diabetic neuropathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. Non-dia - betic neuropathy may be treatable.(2) For symptomatic diabetic neuropathy, medical treatment may be an option.(3) About 50% of diabetic neuropathy is asymptomatic, which increases the risk of DFUs due to decreased sensation in the feet.(4) Diabetic autonomic neuropathy involves the entire body.Recognition and treatment of autonomic neuropathy may improve symptoms, reduce sequelae, and improve quality of life.Moon JS, et al.640 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgA neurologic examination includes sensory and motor func - tion tests.In diabetes, sensory nerves, including tactile, pain, temperature, vibration, and joint sensation, are more rapidly and severely damaged than motor nerves; therefore, sensory function tests are more important in diagnosing DPN.
Abnor - malities in large-myelinated nerve fibers can be assessed by light tactile, vibration, and joint sensations. In contrast, abnor - malities in small-myelinated or unmyelinated nerves can be identified by assessing pain and temperature sensations.Of the neurologic tests, the 10-g monofilament test is the simplest and most used method [578].The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) is a screening tool designed to identify diabetic neuropathy.The MNSI consists of a brief 15-question survey about pain, tem - perature sensation, and tingling, among other neuropathy symptoms, and a neurological physical examination that in - cludes an assessment of the foot for ulcers or deformities, ankle reflexes, vibrotactile testing with a 128 Hz tuning fork, and a 10-g monofilament test [578].
Therefore, people with diabetes should be screened for distal symmetrical polyneuropathy once a year with a neurologic examination (10-g monofilament test, vibrotactile testing, and ankle reflex test) and small-fiber func - tion testing, such as thermosensory testing, and pin-prick test - ing [572-574,578,579]. Performing two or more of these tests can increase the diagnostic sensitivity for distal symmetrical polyneuropathy to more than 87% [579].Neurological tests are likely to be subjective to both the ex - aminer and the subject.Quantitative sensory neurologic test - ing, measuring vibration, temperature, and pain thresholds, may be used to compensate for this limitation, but these tests may also be subjective to some extent.Nerve conduction study provides the most accurate and objective assessment of periph - eral neurologic function but requires skilled examiners and appropriate equipment.
This study can be performed when the clinical presentations are atypical and the diagnosis uncertain to exclude other causes [572-574,578,579]. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy affects the sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons of the autonomic nervous system of multiple organs.Therefore, obtaining a detailed history, con - ducting a comprehensive physical examination and using the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31 (COMPASS 31) questionnaire is important in identifying various symptoms and signs of autonomic nervous system abnormalities [572,580].Benefits Screening for diabetic peripheral and autonomic neuropathy at the initial diagnosis of diabetes and initiating early treatment can delay and prevent the development of diabetic neuropathy, control neuropathic pain, improve quality of life, prevent dia - betic foot disease, prevent and reduce amputations, reduce hospitalizations, and decrease mortality.
Half of the people with diabetic neuropathy are asymptomatic, and neuropathic pain negatively affects the physical and psychological quality of life. Therefore, early diagnosis is critical for effective manage - ment of diabetic neuropathy.Risks As DPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, any signs or symptoms dif - ferent from the typical presentation of diabetic neuropathy must be examined to exclude other causes [573].Neurological examinations are likely to be subjective to the examiner and the subject.Quantitative sensory neurologic testing, which measures vibration, temperature, and pain thresholds, can be used to compensate for these limitations, but these methods may also be partly subjective.Nerve conduction study provides the most accurate and objective assessment of peripheral nerve function and can be performed when the clinical presentation is atypical and the diagnosis uncertain, to exclude other causes [573].
Quantitative sensory nerve testing and nerve conduc - tion study can increase healthcare costs. Balancing the benefits and risks The benefits of screening for diabetic peripheral and autonom - ic neuropathy and performing tests, such as quantitative sen - sory nerve testing and nerve conduction study, to exclude oth - er causes of neuropathy outweigh the harms (increased health - care costs due to inappropriate diagnosis and testing).These benefits include delaying, preventing, and reducing the devel - opment of diabetic neuropathy and DFUs, reducing hospital - izations, and lowering mortality.
Recommendation 16.3 In the presence of symptoms of diabetic au - tonomic neuropathy (such as resting tachycardia, orthostatic hypo - tension, gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea, fecal incontinence, erectile dysfunction, voiding dysfunction, urinary incontinence, sweating of the body trunk and face, or anhidrosis of the lower ex - tremities), tests for CAN, GI autonomic nervous function, urody - namics, and sweating are required. [Expert opinion, limited recom - mendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea641 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgBackground Several clinical studies and meta-analyses have shown that CAN is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortali - ty, arrhythmias, silent myocardial ischemia, major cardiovas - cular events, and myocardial dysfunction.
Examination for early diagnosis of CAN should be considered in people with diabetes who experience symptoms of lightheadedness, palpi - tations, dizziness, or syncope upon standing [581-584]. Hypo - glycemia unawareness can be associated with CAN, leading to SH, arrhythmias, and increased cardiovascular mortality [584, 585].CAN can be diagnosed by symptoms and signs and eval - uation of heart rate variability with respiration or Valsalva ma - neuver, and blood pressure variability upon standing [585-587].
Examinations such as GI autonomic nerve function tests, uro - dynamic studies, and sweating tests can be conducted to diag - nose diabetic autonomic neuropathy, and treatment to improve symptoms and quality of life may be required in patients with diabetes presenting symptoms of diabetic autonomic neuropa - thy, such as gastroparesis with nausea and vomiting, constipa - tion, diarrhea, fecal incontinence, erectile dysfunction, voiding dysfunction, urinary incontinence, sweating in the body trunk and face, or anhidrosis of the lower extremities [572,574]. Benefits Early diagnosis of CAN may alleviate symptoms, reduce mor - bidity and mortality, and improve quality of life in patients with diabetes with symptoms and signs of CAN, such as tachycardia at rest and orthostatic hypotension.
Similarly, early diagnosis of diabetic autonomic neuropathy with corresponding tests can improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with diabetes presenting with symptoms of autonomic neuropathy, such as gastroparesis with nausea and vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, fecal incontinence, erectile dysfunction, voiding dysfunction, urinary incontinence, sweating in the body trunk and face, or lower extremity anhidrosis. Risks Differential diagnosis is necessary as underlying comorbid conditions or drug effects/interactions may mimic symptoms or signs of CAN and other autonomic neuropathies.Many medications can directly or indirectly affect CAN and other au - tonomic neuropathies.
Testing for CAN and other autonomic neuropathies may increase healthcare costs.Balancing the benefits and risks Since CAN is associated with increased morbidity and mortal - ity, decreased quality of life, and limitations in daily activities, the benefits of conducting cardiovascular and other autonomic function testing and taking appropriate measures when symp - toms appear outweigh the harms. Level of evidence Several RCTs and meta-analyses have highlighted the impor - tance of glycemic control in the treatment of diabetic peripher - al and autonomic neuropathy.Many studies have shown that hyperglycemia and the severity of DPN are closely related and that aggressive glycemic control prevents and delays the devel - opment of diabetic neuropathy in people with T1DM [99,588- 592].In the DCCT, intensive glycemic control reduced the morbidity of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy to 50% to 60% in people with T1DM [589,590].
On the contrary, in peo - ple with T2DM, the effect of intensive glycemic control on neu - ropathy was reduced in some studies, while others reported no significant effect [99,593,594]. Benefits For people with T1DM and some with T2DM, intensive glyce - mic control prevents and delays the development of diabetic peripheral and autonomic neuropathy.Alleviating neuropathic pain and DPN symptoms improves quality of life, aids nerve regeneration by preventing degeneration, and prevents severe complications such as limb loss.Risks Strict glycemic control does not prevent or delay the develop - ment of diabetic peripheral and autonomic neuropathy in all people with T2DM, and adverse events related to medication use for such intensive glycemic management may occur.Balancing the benefits and risks When comparing the benefits and risks of intensive glycemic control, the benefits outweigh the harms.
Strict glycemic con - trol is beneficial in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy; there - fore, achieving and maintaining the target glucose level is es -Recommendation 16.4 Strict glycemic management is necessary, as adequate glycemic control prevents or delays the development and progression of DPN and CAN in both T1DM and T2DM. [Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.642 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgsential in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.Level of evidence For the medical treatment of diabetic neuropathy, RCTs on various drugs, such as those based on etiology, mechanism of action, or symptom control, were evaluated.Benefits Medical treatment of diabetic neuropathy is based on etiologic and symptomatic medications to reduce pain and improve quality of life by reducing sleep disturbances, depression, and anxiety.
Etiologic agents for diabetic neuropathy include anti - oxidants (alpha-fatty acids, gamma-linolenic acid), vasodila - tors, benfotiamine, and aldose reductase inhibitors, and may help control neuropathic pain and improve clinical outcomes. Anticonvulsants (α2δ ligands), tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin/norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitors may be administered at the lowest initial dose and titrated afterward.Adding opioids to control neuropathic pain and improve quality of life may also be considered [595-609].Risks In some people, medications used for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy may not have any effect on pain control but instead cause adverse drug reactions (such as dizziness, drowsiness, lower extremity edema, weight gain, dry mouth, blurred vi - sion, headache, voiding difficulty, increased intraocular pres - sure, palpitation, arrhythmia, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac diseases).
Balancing the benefits and risks The benefits of medical treatment of diabetic neuropathy out - weigh the risks, and medications are beneficial in treating dia - betic neuropathy. These medications can improve quality of life by alleviating pain and reducing sleep disturbances, de - pression, and anxiety.Alternatives and considerations Medications for diabetic neuropathic pain should be titrated gradually from the initial dose and monitored until the medi -cation is effective.If symptoms persist, medications can be substituted or combined with those of different mechanisms of action.Adding opioids or nonpharmacologic therapies for pain control may also be considered.Background Several guidelines and meta-analyses have reported that DFUs can be prevented by routine screening, identifying high-risk groups, educating patients, families, and healthcare providers, proper footwear selection, and treatment of non-ulcerative le - sions.
Therefore, a comprehensive foot evaluation and foot care education are recommended as part of a routine foot examina - tion, and additional angiographic studies, exercise therapy, medical treatment, and interventions may be considered in people with suspected peripheral vascular disease (i.e., severe claudication) [610-618]. All people with diabetes should have their foot inspected at every visit and assessed for risks of diabetic foot disease, includ - ing a history of foot ulcers or amputations, neuropathic and pe - ripheral vascular disease symptoms, visual impairment, renal disease, smoking, and foot care routines.The neurologic exami - nation should include a 10-g monofilament test to identify loss of protective sensation rather than to detect early signs of neu - ropathy.The 10-g monofilament test should be performed in combination with at least one of the following tests: needle- prick, temperature sensation or vibration sensation with a 128 Hz tuning fork, or ankle reflex.
DPN, peripheral vascular dis - ease, and abnormal foot weight-bearing can lead to foot ulcers and, eventually, amputation; therefore, early evaluation and di - agnosis are essential.

[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 16.7 Perform peripheral angiography in people with severe claudication, weak dorsal artery pulse, or an ankle-bra - chial index of ≤0.9. [Randomized controlled trial, limited recom - mendation] Recommendation 16.8 A multidisciplinary approach is required for DFUs.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea643 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgdex should be calculated.Any abnormal results require further evaluation with angiographic studies, and exercise therapy, medical treatment, and interventions may be considered.In patients with diabetes, PAD is common and often asymptom - atic.
Therefore, ankle-brachial indices should be calculated in patients with diabetes over the age of 50 and may be considered for those younger than 50 who have other risk factors of PAD (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or a period of more than 10 years from the time of diabetes diagnosis) [610,613]. Any abnormal test findings or presence of severe symptoms must be referred for further angiographic studies.Foot ulcers and wounds may require treatment by a podiatrist or an ortho - pedics, vascular surgery, or rehabilitation medicine specialist experienced in diabetic foot care [610,613].The standard care for DFUs includes antibiotics treatment, wound debridement, infection control, revascularization if necessary, and off-load - ing of the plantar ulcerations with total contact casts [615-618].
Adjunctive treatments include advanced wound therapies such as negative pressure wound therapy, hyperbaric oxygen thera - py, topical growth factors, bioengineered cellular therapies us - ing fibroblast and keratinocytes, bioengineered dermal replace -ment therapy, and stem cell therapies [618]. Benefits Foot ulcers and amputations are the result of diabetic neuropa - thy or PAD and are common major causes of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes.Therefore, annual compre - hensive foot assessment and foot care education may help the early detection and treatment initiation of diabetic foot disease in people with diabetes, delaying or preventing harmful out - comes and ultimately reducing hospitalization and mortality.Risks Additional angiographic studies for diabetic foot disease may lead to increased healthcare costs.Drug-related adverse events may occur, and in some cases, treatment may not be effective.
Balancing the benefits and risks The benefits of comprehensive evaluation and angiographic studies for diabetic foot disease outweigh the harms; therefore, the aforementioned evaluation and studies should be per - formed.

When retinopathy progresses to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), an immediate referral to an ophthalmologist for panretinal laser photocoagulation therapy is required.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 7.Intravitreous injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are an alternative to panretinal laser photocoagulation for som individuals with PDR.[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 8.For the treatment of diabetic retinopathy with macular edema, intravitreous injections of anti-VEGF or intravitreal dexamethasone implant - sare indicated.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 17.1 Optimal management of blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipids is recommended to reduce the risk or delay the progression of diabetic retinopathy.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Benefits The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy and PDR are 15.9%– 35.4% and 6.1%–7.5%, respectively [619,620]. The duration of diabetes is the strongest predictor of the development and pro - gression of diabetic retinopathy.Inadequate glycemic control constitutes a substantial risk factor.The correlation between the degree of glycemic control and diabetic retinopathy was clearly demonstrated in the DCCT.Additional risk factors in - clude diabetic nephropathy, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and smoking.Futhermore, puberty and pregnancy are also impor -tant risk factors in people with T1DM.Large-scale prospective RCTs, including the DCCT and the UKPDS, have demonstrat - ed that maintaining nearly normal glucose levels through stringent glycemic control from the time of initial diabetes di - agnosis can prevent or delay the onset of diabetic retinopathy [96,621].
Blood pressure control has also been shown to pre - vent or delay the development of diabetic retinopathy [442], however the ACCORD-eye study did not find additional ben - efits in lowering SBP to below 120 mm Hg [622]. Dyslipidemia is thought to contribute to the progression of diabetic retinop - 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea645 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgathy, with evidence from two large-scale studies indicating that fenofibrate may prevent or mitigate the progression of this condition [623,624].Risks The risks involved in managing blood sugar, blood pressure, and lipids are related to the potential adverse effects of phar - macological treatments.Benefits Early detection and treatment through routine screening are necessary to prevent vision loss, as people with PDR or macular edema may be asymptomatic.
Based on studies showing that retinopathy accompanied by vision loss rarely occurs within 3 to 5 years of T1DM diagnosis, an initial dilated and compre - hensive eye examination is recommended within 5 years of di - agnosis. Based on research findings that retinopathy accompa - nied by vision impairment rarely occurs within 3 to 5 years after the onset of hyperglycemia, it is recommended that individuals with T1DM have an initial dilated fundus examination and comprehensive ophthalmic examination within 5 years of their diabetes diagnosis.People with T2DM, who may have had years of undiagnosed diabetes at the time of diagnosis, should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination at the time of diagnosis.Recently, considering cost-effectiveness, there is an opinion that the screening interval can be extended for low-risk groups of diabetic retinopathy.
He DCCT/EDIC study, which followed T1DM patients for over 30 years, shows that determining the screening interval based on the current retinal status and HbA1c levels could reduce the number of screenings while still being efficient for diabetic patients with - out retinopathy [625]. Nonetheless, evidence supporting the extension of the screening interval beyond 1 year remains lim - ited [626].Therefore, if you have at least one normal result on an annual test and have good glycemic control, you may want to consider testing every 1 to 2 years [627].If the screening test shows abnormal results, more frequent testing may be needed depending on the progression of the disease.
Per the 2017 Inter - national Council of Ophthalmology (ICO) guidelines for dia - betic retinopathy management, in countries with well-equipped medical resources like ours, recommended screening intervals include: diabetics without retinopathy every 1 to 2 years; those with mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) every 6 to 12 months; moderate NPDR every 3 to 6 months; severe NPDR every 3 months; PDR requiring further treatment should be screened monthly; and treated, stable PDR every 6 to 12 months [628]. When managing macular edema, the follow- up intervals should be adjusted based on the extent of involve - ment: non-center-involving macular edema warrants follow- ups every 3 to 6 months, while center-involving macular edema requires more frequent monitoring, every 1 to 3 months.For macular edema treated with anti-VEGF , monthly follow-ups may be necessary.
It’s imperative to tailor the follow-up interval to the individual’s specific circumstances, taking into account factors such as the current state of the retina, any concurrent ocular conditions, systemic health issues, and socioeconomic factors. Risks Screening for diabetic retinopathy primarily consists of fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and retinal angi - ography (fluorescein angiography).These non-invasive tests carry a minimal potential for harm.Although retinal angiog - raphy previously entailed a risk of adverse effects due to fluo - rescein dye injections, advancements in optical coherence to - mography for retinal angiography have significantly reduced this risk to almost negligible levels.
Thus, the considerations now are the duration and cost of the examination [629].Recommendation 17.2 Screening plan: 1) Individuals with T1DM should have an initial comprehensive eye examination, including a dilated peripheral fundus exami - nation, within 5 years of diagnosis. [Expert opinion, general recommendation] 2) People with T2DM should have an initial comprehensive eye examination, including a dilated peripheral fundus examina - tion, at the time of diabetes diagnosis.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 3) Following the initial examination, annual eye screenings are recommended.However, if there is no evidencen of retinopathy and glycemic indicators are within the goal range, screenings may be considered at 1 to 2 year intervals.[Randomized con - trolled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 17.3 Individuals of child-bearing potential with diabetes who are planning pregnancy should have an eye examination before pregnancy.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommen - dation] Recommendation 17.4 Individuals with preexisting diabetes who are Moon JS, et al.646 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgBenefits Pregnancy can exacerbate the progression of diabetic retinopa - thy [630]. Therefore, individuals of child-bearing potential with diabetes who are planning pregnancy should have an eye examination in advance and be counseled about the risk of de - veloping or aggravating diabetic retinopathy.During pregnan - cy, an eye examination should be received within the first 3 months, and follow-up tests should be conducted at appropri - ate intervals depending on the severity of retinopathy.The re - sults show that the increased risk of diabetic retinopathy per - sists up to 12 months postpartum, thus thorough follow-up examinations are conducted for up to 1 year after childbirth [630].
On the other hand, individuals with gestational diabetes do not require eye examinations during pregancny as they do not appear to be at increased risk of developing retinopathy during pregnancy [631]. The screening schedule may need to be adjusted to occur more frequently or occasionally depend - ing on the patient’s retinal status, among other factors.The in - dications and methods for panretinal photocoagulation are es - sentially the same as for the general patient population.There is a view that laser photocoagulation can be delayed until after delivery to allow for natural regression, but most still recom - mend immediate treatment due to the increased likelihood of intraocular hemorrhage during childbirth.Careful consider - ation is advised in deciding whether to treat diabetic macular edema, as it may improve postpartum, and laser treatment could potentially exacerbate the condition.
Risks The risk of harm from eye examination in pregnant individuals is similar to that in the general diabetic retinopathy screening protocol and is not increased by pregnancy.Benefits Although there has been some controversy about whether as - pirin use increases the risk of retinal hemorrhage in people with diabetic retinopathy, the Early Treatment Diabetic Reti - nopathy Study (ETDRS) reported that daily aspirin intake at 650 mg did not increase the risk of retinopathy progression or hemorrhage [632]. Therefore, the presence of diabetic retinop - athy does not constitute a contraindication for the use of aspi - rin in preventing CVD or for other therapeutic purposes.Risks The hypothesis suggesting an increased risk of hemorrhage in diabetic retinopathy due to aspirin use is not supported, and the associated risks of aspirin usage align with the convention - al risks observed with its medical administration.
Benefits The therapeutic effectiveness of panretinal photocoagulation has been proven by two major studies. The Diabetic Retinopa - thy Study (DRS) findings revealed that panretinal photocoagu - lation diminished the risk of severe vision impairment by 60% in individuals with PDR 2 years post-treatment [633].In the ETDRS, although panretinal photocoagulation has not proven effective in mild or moderate non-proliferative retinopathy, it was found to be effective in patients with high-risk prolifera - tive retinopathy, and it also reduced the risk of vision loss by 50% in patients with clinically significant macular edema [634].Risks Possible complications from panretinal photocoagulation can include peripheral visual field defects, macular edema, and ret - inal hemorrhage.Notably, peripheral visual field defects are re - ported in all instances of panretinal photocoagulation treat - ment and are irreversible [635].
Recommendation 17.5 The use of aspirin for the prevention of CVD does not increase the risk of retinal hemorrhage. [Randomized con - trolled trial, general recommendation]Recommendation 17.6 When retinopathy progresses to PDR, an immediate referral to an ophthalmologist for panretinal laser photo - coagulation therapy is required.[Expert opinion, general recommen - dation] Recommendation 17.7 Intravitreous injections of anti-VEGF are an alternative to panretinal laser photocoagulation for som individuals with PDR.[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation]pregnant should have an eye examination within the first 3 months of pregnancy and receive counseling on the risks associated with the de - velopment and progression of diabetic retinopathy.Eye examinations should be monitored every 3 months and for 1 year postpartum.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea647 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgBenefits The therapeutic efficacy of intravitreous anti-VEGF injection for PDR has been proven in two large-scale studies. In the Dia - betic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCRN) study, administering ranibizumab to patients with PDR was not infe - rior in reducing vision loss compared to those who received la - ser photocoagulation, and it resulted in less peripheral vision decline, fewer vitrectomy procedures, and reduced occurrence of retinal edema [636].In the clinical efficacy and mechanistic evaluation of aflibercept for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (CLARITY) study, patients with PDR treated with aflibercept showed visual outcomes that were not only not inferior but also superior to those who underwent laser photocoagulation [637].
Risks Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF for the treatment of PDR has the disadvantage of increasing the number of treatments and being less cost-effective than laser photocoagulation [638].Benefits Intravitreous injection treatments of anti-VEGF agents such as bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept are being used for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. In particular, all three drugs have been proven to improve vision in patients with clini - cally significant macular edema [639].Additionally, intravitreal injection of dexamethasone implants can be expected to reduce macular edema [640].Risks Possible risks of intravitreous injections of anti-VEGF include ocular complications such as endophthalmitis, which are mananged with antibiotics and surgical interventions like vit - rectomy [641].There is controversy regarding the hypothesis that intravitreous injections of anti-VEGF increase the risk of CVD.
It has been suggested that some of the anti-VEGF inject - ed into the eye may enter the systemic circulation and increase the risk of CVD by inhibiting physiological VEGF , though this has not been proven [642]. Intravitreal injections of dexameth - asone implants may have side effects, such as inducing cata - racts or increasing the risk of elevated intraocular pressure [640].Recommendation 17.8 For the treatment of diabetic retinopathy with macular edema, intravitreous injections of anti-VEGF or intra - vitreal dexamethasone implantsis indicated.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.648 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.org18.DIABETES AND PREGNANCY 1.Optimal glycemic control is essential to minimize the risk of perinatal obstetric complications.[Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2.
During pregnancy, regular SMBG is recommended; glycemic goals are FPG <95 mg/dL, 1-hour postprandial glucose <140 mg/dL, and 2-hour postpandial glucose <120 mg/dL.

[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 8. Women with gestational diabetes should have the 75 g OGTT at 4 to 12 weeks after delivery and should be screened for the development of diabetes and prediabetes annually thereafter.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 9.Mothers with gestational diabetes are advised to control their weight and breastfeed after childbirth to improve metabolic risk factors.[Ran - domized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 18.1 Optimal glycemic control is essential to minimize the risk of perinatal obstetric complications.[Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Level of evidence Glycemic control during pregnancy has been reported to reduce the risk of perinatal complications, as evidenced by RCTs in pregnant women with T1DM and observational studies in other pregnant women.
Benefits Diabetes itself and the degree of hyperglycemia are associated not only with an increase in perinatal complications for the mother and fetus and chronic complications in the pregnant woman but also with the risk of obesity, hypertension, and T2DM in the offspring [23,643-645]. The HAPO study has shown that higher glucose tolerance test values during preg - nancy are continuously associated with an increased incidence of perinatal complications [30].RCTs involving pregnant wom -en with T1DM have demonstrated that effective glycemic con - trol is associated with a reduced incidence of perinatal compli - cations compared to inadequate control [646,647].Additional - ly, observational studies have indicated that good glycemic management reduces the incidence of perinatal complications in pregnant women with both T1DM and T2DM [648].
Risks This leads to an increase in the number of pregnant women who require treatment, particularly raising the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM. Balancing the benefits and risks Exposure to hyperglycemia during pregnancy is linked with increased short- and long-term complications.Therefore, the 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea649 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgbenefits of glycemic control during pregnancy are significant.However, the goals for glycemic control should be carefully ad - justed to mitigate the increased risk of hypoglycemia associat - ed with treatment.Alternatives and considerations It is difficult to conduct RCTs on glycemic control targets in pregnant women, and since most results are based on observa - tional studies, there is a need to adjust glycemic targets accord - ing to the type of diabetes and the individual circumstances of the patient.
Level of evidence Given the practical difficulties of conducting clinical studies, such as RCTs, recommendations have been made based on ex - pert opinions. Benefits In normal pregnancies, FPG typically measures 70 mg/dL, 1-hour postprandial blood glucose is around 110 mg/dL, and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose stands at 100 mg/dL [649].The approach follows the opinion that lowering the blood glu - cose levels of pregnant women with diabetes to levels close to those of normal pregnancies aims to reduce perinatal compli - cations due to hyperglycemia [28].Monitoring postprandial blood glucose levels, compared to monitoring fasting blood glucose levels, resulted in better glycemic control and a lower risk of complications such as preeclampsia [646,647].SMBG allows for the assessment of glycemic management and the ad - justment of insulin dosage.Risks There is a lack of large-scale clinical studies comparing the ef - fects of monitoring pre-prandial and postprandial blood glu - cose.
For pregnant women applying insulin pumps or basal in - sulin, it is necessary to monitor not only postprandial but also pre-prandial blood glucose levels. The uncertainty about the op - timal timing of blood glucose measurements and the risk of hy - poglycemia increases as insulin therapy is intensified to achieve target blood glucose levels.Therefore, it is necessary to individu -alize the timing of blood glucose measurements and the range of target blood glucose levels according to the individual circum - stances of the pregnant woman.Balancing the benefits and risks Failure to self-monitor or maintain glucose levels within the target range can elevate the risk of perinatal complications due to hyperglycemia.However, increasing insulin to achieve glyce - mic control targets can raise the risk of hypoglycemia.There - fore, the target blood glucose levels may need to be adjusted for pregnant individuals with IAH or those at high risk for hypo - glycemia.
Alternatives and considerations HbA1c can be measured regardless of fasting state and reflects the degree of blood glucose control over a relatively long peri - od, making it a suitable target for glycemic control. However, pregnant individuals may have lower HbA1c values compared to non-pregnant individuals due to the shorter lifespan of red blood cells during pregnancy.Therefore, the interval between HbA1c measurements should be reduced to 1 month, aiming for a target of less than 6% or less than 7% if the risk of hypo - glycemia is significant.Level of evidence It is challenging to conduct RCTs on lifestyle modification in pregnant individuals, so the recommendation is based on ex - pert opinion.
Benefits During pregnancy, specialized medical nutrition education is recommended to ensure that individuals consume the neces - sary calories to support fetal growth and maternal health and to select the quantity and quality of carbohydrates to achieve gly - cemic control within the target range [650]. Education in medi - cal nutrition can enhance food literacy, and choosing carbohy - drates with a low glycemic index effectively controls postpran - dial glycemia [651,652].Exercise can improve blood glucose levels, and moderate-intensity exercise can lower blood glucose Recommendation 18.2 During pregnancy, regular SMBG is recom - mended; glycemic goals are FPG <95 mg/dL, 1-hour postprandial glucose <140 mg/dL, and 2-hour postpandial glucose <120 mg/dL.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 18.3 For pregnant women with diabetes, lifestyle correction, including MNT, is recommended.
[Expert opinion, gener - al recommendation] Recommendation 18.4 Light exercise is recommended if not contra - indicated. [Expert opinion, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.650 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orglevels and reduce the need for insulin treatment [653].Beyond glycemic control, exercise enhances the quality of life for preg - nant individuals and improves cardiorespiratory fitness [654].Risks Carbohydrate restriction may lead to excessive fat intake, in - creasing insulin resistance, and the potential for fetal growth promotion [655].It is important to be aware of contraindica - tions to exercise, such as gestational hypertension, preterm rupture of membranes, preterm labor, cervical atony, uterine bleeding, and intrauterine growth restriction.Balancing the benefits and risks Personal preferences and culture highly influence food choices.
Most clinical studies conducted to date have focused on West - ern populations, leading to inconsistencies with the situation of pregnant individuals in Korea. Therefore, it is essential to tailor the program to each individual while monitoring glyce - mia and fetal growth.Assessing contraindications to exercise must precede to prevent adverse effects associated with physi - cal activity.Pregnant women using insulin require education and management strategies to address concerns about hypo - glycemia due to exercise.Alternatives and considerations Along with MNT, lifestyle modifications such as increased physical activity or light exercise after meals are recommended, and education on weight management is also necessary for obese pregnant women [656].
Large-scale exercise intervention studies in this population are very limited, and general recom - mendations include 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise five times per week, or at least 150 minutes of exercise per week, supplemented by 10 to 15 minutes of brisk walking after each meal [650]. Level of evidence In a meta-analysis focusing on gestational diabetes, insulin, and metformin were associated with fewer perinatal complica - tions compared to sulfonylureas.The difference in perinatal complications between insulin and metformin remained un - clear, yet insulin is recommended as the first choice since met -formin crosses the placenta.Benefits The Metformin in Gestational Diabetes (MiG) study, which compared metformin to insulin in 751 individuals with gesta - tional diabetes, found no difference in the incidence of perina - tal complications.
However, 46.3% of the group treated with metformin required insulin treatment, indicating a higher treatment failure rate with metformin [657]. In a meta-analy - sis, glibenclamide was found to be inferior to insulin or met - formin in terms of neonatal weight, the percentage of over - weight infants, and the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia [658].Insulin therapy is more likely to achieve target glycemia and is associated with a lower incidence of obstetric complica - tions.Its use can be tailored according to the individual’s con - dition, with flexible dosing options.Risks Insulin therapy carries a risk of hypoglycemia, necessitates more frequent hospital visits than nonpharmacologic treat - ments or oral hypoglycemic agents, and may not be favored by some individuals.
Balancing the benefits and risks In two Cochrane meta-analyses published in 2017, there was no clear evidence that insulin treatment was superior to treatment with metformin or glyburide [659], and oral medications did not demonstrate a clear benefit over placebo [660]. Thus, these analyses did not establish the superiority of insulin treatment over other treatments.However, oral hypoglycemic agents, such as metformin and glyburide, cross the placenta [661] and are not recommended as the first-line treatment due to rates of treatment failure and concerns about infant weight gain during long-term follow-up [662].Nonetheless, metformin may be considered if insulin is unavailable, but it is contraindicated in individuals at risk for placental insufficiency, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth retardation [656].
Alternatives and considerations While studies show effective results for oral hypoglycemic agents aside from insulin therapy, there is uncertainty regard - ing the long-term safety of oral hypoglycemic agents. In South Korea, the increase in medical costs associated with initiating insulin therapy is not as significant as in other countries, so the issue of limited medical resources for insulin therapy is rela -Recommendation 18.5 Initiate insulin therapy if medical nutrition and exercise therapy do not achieve glycemic goals.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea651 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgtively minor.There is no clear superior result for the type and usage of insulin, indicating a need for individualization [663].See section ‘Continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps, ’ Recommendation 6.
Level of evidence Pregnant individuals with diabetes are at increased risk for pre - eclampsia. The U.S.Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that low-dose aspirin be started at 12 weeks’ ges - tation in those at high risk for preeclampsia.However, meta- analyses have shown that aspirin doses of less than 100 mg have not been effective in preventing preeclampsia.Consequently, the ADA recommends initiating 100 mg of aspirin at 12 to 16 weeks’ gestation.The studies included in the analysis comprised one meta- analysis [664], a secondary analysis of one meta-analysis [665], and a secondary analysis of two RCTs [666].Depending on the study, the aspirin dosage was analyzed as either more than 100 mg per day or less than 100 mg per day in subgroups [664] or varied doses such as 80 mg [665,666].The timing of aspirin administration was analyzed as before 16 weeks of pregnancy or after 16 weeks [664], or between 13 and 26 weeks [665,666].
The analysis method was a secondary analysis rather than a pre-planned analysis within RCTs, which could introduce the possibility of bias. Study populations identified individuals with diabetes as one of the risk factors for preeclampsia.Al - though no study focused exclusively on individuals with dia - betes, some were specifically limited to those with diabetes and undergoing insulin therapy.Therefore, there is considerable heterogeneity in aspirin dosing and the study populations.Benefits Preeclampsia was analyzed as the primary outcome, with one meta-analysis sorting preeclampsia into preterm and term at 37 weeks [664].Compared with placebo, aspirin treatment signifi - cantly reduced the RR of preterm preeclampsia to 0.62 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.87), and doses of 100 mg or more of aspirin before 16 weeks’ gestation were found to be more protective, with a RR of 0.33 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.57).
Aspirin at a dose of 60 mg was associated with a significant reduction in preeclampsia only in individuals with stage 1 hypertension, with a HR of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.94) [665], and did not show a significant ef - fect in analyses that include all races [666]. Risks Aspirin crosses the placenta, and there is insufficient data re - garding its safety for fetal development.There is a lack of stud - ies involving Korean individuals with pre-existing diabetes, and based on the currently reported results, it is also not possible to determine whether aspirin prevents preeclampsia in mothers with aspirin resistance.Moreover, a secondary analysis of an existing meta-analysis found that aspirin use was associated with increased birth weight [667].Balancing the benefits and risks Diabetes before pregnancy is a significant risk factor for pre - eclampsia, which increases the risk of maternal organ damage, fetal growth issues, and preterm birth.
Therefore, efforts should be made to prevent preeclampsia in mothers with pre-existing diabetes before pregnancy. The risk of preeclampsia is especial - ly high in those who require insulin therapy or have high blood pressure.In a meta-analysis of existing studies, 100 mg of aspi - rin before 16 weeks was associated with a one-third reduction in the risk of preeclampsia in high-risk individuals [664], so as - pirin use is recommended for those at high risk.However, there is a lack of data on long-term outcomes for the child, and un - certainty exists about the balance of benefits and harms.There - fore, the potential benefits and harms should be carefully con - sidered in each individual’s condition.Alternatives and considerations RCTs of aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia did not ex - clusively target individuals with diabetes but included them as part of the high-risk group for preeclampsia.The dosage and timing of aspirin administration varied.
In the future, large- scale clinical studies are necessary to confirm the effectiveness and safety of different aspirin regimens in pregnant individuals with diabetes and to examine the long-term prognosis for the infant.Recommendation 18.6 For pregnant women with T1DM, a rtCGM device is recommended to control blood glucose levels, reduce the risks of hypoglycemia, and improve obstetric outcomes. [Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 18.7 For pregnant women with pre-existing dia - betes, starting aspirin therapy of 100 mg from 12 to 16 weeks of preg - nancy is considered for the prevention of preeclampsia.[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] Moon JS, et al.652 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgLevel of evidence A meta-analysis revealed a 10-fold increased risk of T2DM af - ter delivery for individuals with gestational diabetes [668].
In a Korean observational study, nearly half of those with gestation - al diabetes developed T2DM within 10 years of delivery [669]. In a multivariate regression analysis, FPG levels did not predict T2DM development.However, blood glucose levels measured during a 2-hour OGTT were predictive of T2DM, necessitating the performance of the OGTT [670].Benefits Since individuals with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of developing prediabetes and T2DM after childbirth, ear - ly diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications.Risks The OGTT may cause nausea or vomiting in some individuals and hypoglycemia in those who have undergone GI bypass sur - gery.Balancing the benefits and risks The incidence of T2DM after childbirth in individuals with gestational diabetes increases over time [669,671], making reg - ular blood glucose testing recommended.However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the specific methods and frequency of testing.Fig.

Alternatives and considerations The ADA recommends lifelong monitoring at 1 to 3 year inter - vals for individuals with a history of gestational diabetes.The suggested methods include an annual HbA1c test, an annual FPG test, or a glucose tolerance test every 3 years, tailored to the individual’s specific situation [656].Level of evidence Individuals with gestational diabetes face a 10-fold increased risk of developing T2DM after childbirth [668] and a 2-fold in - creased risk of CVD [672,673].Therefore, active efforts to im - prove cardiovascular risk factors are essential [671].Weight management [674] and lactation [675,676] have been shown to reduce the risk of developing T2DM.
A meta-analysis exam - ining the effectiveness of postpartum lifestyle interventions in preventing T2DM found improvements in glycemic and insu - lin resistance markers, though a reduction in the incidence of T2DM was reported in only one of 11 studies [677]. Benefits Individuals who have experienced gestational diabetes are at an increased risk for metabolic diseases and can reduce their risk of T2DM and CVD through lactation and lifestyle modifi - cations.Breastfeeding benefits for fetal immunity, brain devel - opment, and the prevention of autoimmune diseases.It also supports maternal health by helping to reduce the risk of post - partum depression, uterine cancer, and breast cancer.Risks Mastitis may occur during lactation.The goals for lifestyle and weight management are unclear.Balancing the benefits and risks The risks associated with weight management and lactation are small compared to their benefits.
Alternatives and considerations The benefits of lactation are supported by meta-analyses [676]. Among the 11 RCTs on postpartum lifestyle interventions [677], the intervention period was mostly short, with seven studies lasting less than 6 months, two studies for a year, and two studies for more than a year.Additionally, eight studies did not conduct follow-up observations after the intervention ended.There is a need for additional studies with long-term follow-up to assess the benefits of lifestyle interventions.Recommendation 18.8 Women with gestational diabetes should have the 75 g OGTT at 4 to 12 weeks after delivery and should be screened for the development of diabetes and prediabetes annually thereafter.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 18.9 Mothers with gestational diabetes are ad - vised to control their weight and breastfeed after childbirth to im - prove metabolic risk factors.

[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 6. Individualize treatments or drugs for the CVD risks based on general health.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 7.CGM should be recommended for older adults with T1DM to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.[Randomized controlled trial, general rec - ommendation] 8.For T2DM patients on a multiple insulin injection regimen, continuous glucose measurements should be considered to improve glycemic control and glycemic variability.[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] Recommendation 19.1 Complications or comorbidities of diabetes should be evaluated in older adults, and comprehensive geriatric assess - ment should be performed to check functional autonomy and degree of aging.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 19.2 The glycemic goal is an HbA1c <7.5% but should be individualized considering an older adult’s health condi - tion or degree of aging.
[Expert opinion, general recommendation]Although diabetes is a highly prevalent health condition in old - er adults, it is a highly heterogeneous condition compared to the younger population. Therefore, a comprehensive geriatric assessment should be conducted beyond current glycemic sta - tus, comorbidities, and diabetic complications.This includes aspects of the geriatric syndrome such as nutritional status, vi - sual and auditory function, urinary function, basic and instru - mental activities of daily living, as well as mental functions like cognitive and emotional health [108].Environmental factors such as economic and social support systems, living conditions, and polypharmacy should also be considered [678-680].
Of particular importance in the elderly is the assessment of frailty, characterized by a progressive decline in muscle strength, autonomic function, and resilience, leading to an overall de - crease in functional performance and a reduced ability to main - tain homeostasis, thus increasing the risk of dependency. Frail - ty cannot be solely defined by overt diseases alone and requires a comprehensive assessment, though its application in clinical practice can be challenging.No perfect frailty indicator exists to date, however, a three-level categorization of the overall health status adopted by the ADA in 2012 is widely used (in the United States as healthy/complex/very complex, in Europe as good/intermediate/poor, and in Japan as category I/II/III) [680-683].
This guideline also suggests the convenience of uti - lizing the Korean Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, and Loss of weight (FRAIL) scale (normal/pre-frail/frail) and the Clinical Frailty Scale [678], with the understanding that clini - cal settings require adjustments considering various risk fac - tors [683]. While reducing the risk of hypoglycemia is paramount in older adults, efforts to lower blood glucose should still be made be - 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea655 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgcause hyperglycemia above 200 mg/dL increases the risk of de - hydration, electrolyte imbalance, urinary tract infections, diz - ziness, falls, and hyperglycemic events (hyperosmolar hyper - glycemic state [HHS]/DKA).
However, some studies have re - ported that health benefits may not be as significant as expect - ed and individual satisfaction severely compromised com - pared to efforts to maintain adequate glycemia, making it diffi - cult to emphasize strict glycemic control [684,685]. In the ab - sence of large-scale clinical studies on appropriate glycemic targets in older adults, countries with advanced aging popula - tions have proposed higher glucose control targets through ex - pert consensus.Older adults nearing end-of-life may be considered for mini - mal treatment to manage only symptoms of hyperglycemia.Glycemic control targets based on the degree of frailty and the use of medications with a high risk of hypoglycemia based on international guidelines, but these targets are not based on complete evidence.
Glycemic targets for older adults should be individualized based on assessing health status, including life expectancy and degree of frailty, and thoroughly discussing with the individual and caregivers [686,687]. Exercise and MNT can help manage glycemia, blood pressure, lipids, and weight goals in older adults.Therefore, it is impor - tant to assess physical activity and dietary and nutrition status, provide education to enable appropriate exercise, and facilitate access to MNT [686-688].For those who are not frail, 150 min/ week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise is recommended.However, the type, intensity, and frequency of exercise should be individualized based on individual health status [688,689].Education, including MNT, is crucial for diabetes manage - ment.Older adults may face challenges in managing their diet due to unfavorable eating habits, dental issues, decreased taste, GI dysfunction, and economic or environmental difficulties.
Therefore, healthcare providers must continually educate indi - viduals, taking into account their usual dietary habits, health status, and economic and environmental factors, to enable personalized MNT. It is particularly important to ensure ade - quate protein intake.MNT is recommended as a fundamental measure for improving quality of life and managing cardiovas -cular risk [686,689].Special caution is required when prescribing medications or monitoring their effectiveness in frail individuals.Older adults are more susceptible to hypoglycemia, the symptoms of which can be difficult to recognize promptly, and recovery from hy - poglycemia is slower.Therefore, medications with a high risk of hypoglycemia should be avoided, and if the use of sulfonyl - ureas or insulin is necessary, start with a low dose and gradual - ly increase it [686,690].
Metformin can cause anorexia, so it should be started at a low dose, and consider reducing or discontinuing the agent if associated symptoms arise in individuals already taking met - formin. Thiazolidinediones should be used with caution as they can exacerbate congestive HF and increase the risk of fractures.DPP-4 inhibitors are commonly recommended for older adults due to their low risk of hypoglycemia and minimal side effects, without increasing major cardiovascular events.GLP-1RAs are beneficial for people with diabetes with AS - CVD, but their side effects significantly increase in people over 60 without ASCVD [691].SGLT2 inhibitors require caution due to the risk of dehydration and weight loss, yet offer benefits for ASCVD, HF , and CKD, with these benefits also confirmed in the elderly [291,292].Once-daily basal insulin is appropriate for most people start - ing insulin therapy.
Multiple daily insulin injections can be considered, but the regimen should be simplified as much as possible for frail individuals or those in poor health. Screening for diabetes complications in older adults should be individualized.Older adults may have comorbidities associated with diabetes (hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, etc.) as well as various functional impairments associated with geriatric syndromes (polypharmacy, depression, cognitive im - pairment, incontinence, falls, pain, etc.) [445,551,692,693].In - dividuals in the aging population may exhibit a wide range of Recommendation 19.3 Optimal nutrition and protein intake and regular exercise are recommended for older adults because these can help prevent CVD and improve the quality of life and control blood glucose levels.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Recommendation 19.5 Individualize the screening tests for com - plications and emphasize the dysfunction evaluation.
[Expert opin - ion, general recommendation]Recommendation 19.4 Upon determining the therapy, consider the risk of hypoglycemia, and avoid excessive or complicated ther - apy by checking whether any factors affect adherence to the drugs. [Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.656 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgclinical or functional characteristics depending on the presence of these conditions or disorders.Particular emphasis should be placed on screening for complications that could develop over a short period or significantly impact functional status [108].This includes assessing the risk of falls and dental health problems.For elderly patients with diabetes, controlling other cardiovas - cular risk factors may be more effective in reducing morbidity and mortality than strict glucose control alone (Table 9) [694, 695].
While managing blood pressure has been relatively em - phasized due to its direct effect on reducing major cardiovascu - lar events without a legacy effect, older adults also have a higher risk of adverse effects from blood pressure control, which war - rants caution [445]. For older adults with a long life expectancy who are active, motivated, and without cognitive impairments, a similar goal (140/90 mm Hg) as for younger adults should be set, and education and treatment methods should be provided accordingly [692].On the other hand, for older adults with ad - vanced diabetic complications, limited life expectancy, or severe cognitive and functional impairments, it may be preferable to aim for a higher target (150/90 mm Hg) [292].ACE inhibitors are sometimes recommended as first-line treatment for people with diabetes over 65.Management of dyslipidemia becomes more effective as the absolute risk of CVD increases.
Therefore, it should be highly considered in older adults with high absolute risk, though the evidence is not as robust as for blood pressure treatment. Statins have been proven effective and with minimal side effects in people with diabetes over 65 [693,696].Level of evidence One RCT (Wireless Innovation for Seniors With Diabetes Mel - litus [WISDM]) involving adults with T1DM aged 60 years [697] and older and another RCT (Multiple Daily Injections and Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Diabetes [DIAMOND]) in - volving adults aged 60 years and older with T1DM and T2DM taking multiple insulin injections were analyzed [551].Studies with a mean age of less than 65 were excluded.We excluded studies with a mean age of less than 65 years.Although the number of studies is limited, as the outcomes were similar to those of RCTs in younger adults, the quality of evidence was considered high.
The recommendation was rated as a general recommendation because it is considered appropriate to apply the findings broadly. Benefits In adults with T1DM aged 65 years and older, several observa - tional studies have indicated the ability of CGM to identify Recommendation 19.6 Individualize treatments or drugs for the CVD risks based on general health.[Expert opinion, general recom - mendation]Recommendation 19.7 CGM should be recommended for older adults with T1DM to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.[Random - ized controlled trial, general recommendation] Table 9.

The WISDM study ran - domized adults with T1DM aged 60 years and older 1:1 to CGM or glucose self-monitoring to compare the percentage of time spent below 70 mg/dL over 6 months. The CGM group had a reduction from 5.1% to 2.7%, while the glucose self- monitoring group increased from 4.7% to 4.9%.There was a –1.9% (95% CI, –2.8% to –1.1%) small but significantly lower daily proportion of time with glucose levels less than 70 mg/dL in the CGM group.The glycemic variability was also reduced in the CGM arm, with an 8.8% (95% CI, 6.0% to 11.5%) in - crease in the proportion of blood glucose levels between 70 and 180 mg/dL [697].The DIAMOND study compared the ef - fectiveness of rtCGM with glucose self-monitoring in adults with T1DM and T2DM aged 60 years and older on multiple insulin injections.In the CGM group, glycemia improved slightly (HbA1c difference –0.4%±0.1%, P<0.001) and the glucose variability decreased (CGM group 34%→31%, glucose self-monitoring group 34%→33%; P=0.02).
However, no sig - nificant difference was seen in the daily proportion below 60 mg/dL between the groups [551]. Considering these studies, CGM is considered beneficial for predicting and reducing hypoglycemia risk in older adults with T1DM, and its use is recommended.Risks Potential risks associated with device use include contact der - matitis and discomfort at the attachment site.CGM is more ex - pensive than glucose self-monitoring, and adequate education is required to ensure accurate use and interpretation of results.Balancing the benefits and risks While the risks associated with CGM use are minimal, the benefits of reducing hypoglycemia risk and improving glyce - mic control are substantial.Alternatives and considerations If CGM is not available, more frequent glucose self-monitoring can be advised.CGM serves as a means of checking glucose levels and is critical for adjusting insulin doses.However, spe - cialized and structured training is required to maximize these effects.
The analyzed studies utilized rtCGM, and the efficacy of intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) has not been estab - lished.Level of evidence A single RCT (DIAMOND) including adults over 60 years of age with T1DM and T2DM who received multiple daily insulin injections was analyzed. Although it was the only study, it showed similar results to RCTs in younger adults, thus the level of the evidence was considered high.However, due to the insuf - ficient research specifically targeting older adults with T2DM and its practical difficulties, a limited recommendation was rated.Benefits The DIAMOND study compared the effectiveness of rtCGM with glucose self-monitoring in adults with T1DM and T2DM aged 60 years and older on multiple insulin injections.In the CGM group, glycemia improved slightly (HbA1c difference –0.4%±0.1%, P<0.001) and the glucose variability decreased (CGM group 34%→31%, glucose self-monitoring group 34%→ 33%; P=0.02) [551].
However, no significant difference was seen in the daily proportion below 60 mg/dL between the groups. As in T1DM, CGM may be beneficial for glycemic control in older adults with T2DM on multiple daily insulin injections.Risks Potential risks associated with device use include contact der - matitis and discomfort at the attachment site.CGM is more expensive than glucose self-monitoring, and adequate educa - tion is required to ensure accurate use and interpretation of re - sults.Balancing the benefits and risks While the risks associated with CGM use are minimal, the benefits of reducing hypoglycemia risk and improving glyce - mic control are substantial.Alternatives and considerations If CGM is not available, more frequent glucose self-monitoring can be advised.CGM serves as a means of checking glucose levels and is critical for adjusting insulin doses.However, spe - cialized and structured training is required to maximize these effects.
The analyzed studies utilized rtCGM, and the efficacy of isCGM has not been established.Recommendation 19.8 For T2DM patients on a multiple insulin injection regimen, continuous glucose measurements should be considered to improve glycemic control and glycemic variability.

[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 10.Poor glycemic control or presence of comorbidities in youth with T2DM who have a stage II or higher obesity (≥120% of the 95th percen - tile of BMI) may require bariatric surgery with considerations to the growth state of the youth.[Non-randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 11.For youth with T2DM, routine evaluation of comorbidities and microvascular complications is conducted starting at the time of diagnosis.[Other trial, general recommendation] 12.For youth with T2DM, routine assessments for depression, anxiety, eating disorders, sleep apnea, and sleep disorders should be conducted.[Uncontrolled studies, general recommendation] 13.Y outh with T2DM should be transferred to an adult clinic at an appropriate time.
[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 20.1 Screening for diabetes should be considered after the onset of puberty or ≥10 years of age in overweight or obese children with risk factors for diabetes. [Expert opinion, general recommendation] Level of evidence Expert opinion.Benefits The incidence of T2DM in children and adolescents has been increasing recently [698,699].Overweight or obesity is com - mon, and their onset tends to occur around puberty.Further - more, signs and symptoms of insulin resistance (such as mela - nocytosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and polycystic ovary syndrome), rapid catch-up growth in infants born small for 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea659 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orggestational age, prenatal exposure to maternal diabetes or ges - tational diabetes, and a first- or second-degree family history of T2DM are risk factors for developing T2DM [257,700].
There - fore, screening for prediabetes and T2DM is recommended af - ter the onset of puberty or ≥10 years of age in children and ad - olescents with the above risk factors. Screening tests include FPG, 2-hour plasma glucose of an OGTT, and HbA1c [701].Screening should be conducted at least every 3 years in normal BMI, but more frequently in increased BMI.Given the rise of T2DM in the children and adolescent age groups, rapid pro - gression of β-cell deterioration, and rapid development of com - plications, screening in at-risk populations is necessary.Risks Undiagnosed T2DM in children and adolescents is rare.The diagnostic criteria for prediabetes and diabetes in children and adolescents are the same as in adults, but further research on pediatric diabetes is needed.The USPSTF recently reported that there is insufficient evidence to support screening for pre - diabetes and T2DM in the general pediatric population [702].
Balancing the benefits and risks In Japan, it has been reported that about 15% of T2DM occur in individuals who are not obese [703], and in Taiwan, about half of the adolescents diagnosed with T2DM were not obese [704]. According to domestic reports on asymptomatic T2DM newly diagnosed through urine glucose testing during student health examinations, only 38.5% were obese [705].Therefore, it is common for Korean children and adolescents with T2DM to be non-obese, and differentiation between T1DM and T2DM is essential.Level of evidence There are no RCTs on education in youth with T2DM; there - fore, this recommendation is based on treatments for T1DM and adult T2DM.Non-RCTs of lifestyle interventions in chil - dren and adolescents with T2DM were noted.Benefits Intensive lifestyle modification should be initiated at the time of T2DM diagnosis [700].The diagnosed youth and their fami - ly members should be educated on diabetes self-management.
Moreover, weight loss should be achieved through medical nu - trition and exercise therapy [706,707]. Since there are no RCTs on lifestyle modification in pediatric T2DM, lifestyle modifica - tions in diabetic youth have been based on treatments for T1DM and adult T2DM.A 7% to 10% reduction of excess body weight is recommended [257].Children and adolescents with T2DM are recommended to engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise daily, with muscle- and bone-strengthening exercises three times per week, and to avoid sedentary behaviors.MNT should focus on healthy eat - ing patterns.Obesity and complications of T2DM in children and adolescents increase with age [708,709]; therefore, weight loss through lifestyle modification may improve obesity and delay the development of complications.Risks No lifestyle intervention-related adverse effects have been re - ported in children and adolescents with T2DM.
However, an increase in obesity levels has been observed in obese children and adolescents where lifestyle modification was not adequate - ly implemented [710]. Balance the benefits and risks By participating in lifestyle modification through diabetes edu - cation appropriate for their circumstances and environment, both children and adolescents with diabetes and their families can expect good outcomes.Level of evidence The HbA1c goal for children and adolescents with T2DM is derived from expert opinions and RCTs of pediatric T1DM and adult T2DM.Benefits Hypoglycemia is rare in pediatric T2DM [711].Even though glucose levels may initially be well-regulated, maintaining con - trol tends to become challenging as time progresses [712].Ad - ditionally, there is an increased risk of developing complica - tions related to diabetes [708].
Considering the prolonged na - ture of the disease in these young individuals, it is crucial to set Recommendation 20.2 Children and adolescents diagnosed with T2DM should initiate lifestyle modification and be educated by a team comprising experts, along with their families or caregivers. [Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation]Recommendation 20.3 The HbA1c goal for children and adolescents with T2DM is <7.0%.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.660 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgstricter goals for glucose control.HbA1c should be measured every 3 months.In children and adolescents with T2DM, the target HbA1c is less than 7.0%.However, a lower target, such as 6.5%, can be set for those without SH and treatment-related side effects.Although no long-term follow-up studies of glyce - mic control targets in pediatric T2DM have been conducted, lower mean HbA1c has been associated with fewer diabetic complications [708].
Risks A low HbA1c target may increase the risk for hypoglycemia. However, in children and adolescents with T2DM, the risk of hypoglycemia is low even with insulin use.Balancing the benefits and risks A target HbA1c of below 7.0% in pediatric T2DM is reason - able, but this goal should be individualized based on each indi - vidual’s circumstances.Less stringent HbA1c goals may be considered if there is an increased risk for hypoglycemia.Level of evidence Expert opinion.Benefits Metformin and insulin are the only T2DM medications li - censed in Korea for administration in pediatric and adolescent age groups.Initial pharmacologic therapy can be started with metformin monotherapy, insulin monotherapy, or a combina - tion of both, depending on the youth’s blood glucose level and metabolic abnormalities, such as ketosis [257,700].
Metformin is the initial pharmacologic treatment of choice in asymptom - atic and metabolically stable youth with normal renal function and HbA1c of less than 8.5%. In youth with HbA1c of ≥8.5%, a blood glucose level of ≥250 mg/dL, or ketosis/ketonuria/ke - toacidosis, immediate insulin treatment should be started.The presence of acidosis, ketonuria, ketoacidosis, or HHS warrants treatment with intravenous insulin.In insulin therapy, long- acting insulin is started at 0.25 to 0.5 U/kg daily and adjusted every 2 to 3 days, and metformin may be added after acidosis has been resolved.Initial insulin therapy can usually be discon - tinued within 2 to 6 weeks and replaced by metformin and life - style modification.Metformin can be titrated up to a maxi - mum dose of 2,000 mg daily, depending on blood glucose lev - els.In marked hyperglycemia, insulin therapy quickly im - proves the affected individual’s medical condition and may in - crease treatment compliance.
In metabolically stable patients, glycemic control can be maintained well with metformin monotherapy [713]. Risks Metformin may cause GI disturbances and rarely lactic acido - sis.Insulin may cause hypoglycemia.Balancing the benefits and risks In children and adolescents with T2DM, initial pharmacologic treatment should be decided based on glycemic and metabolic status, with consideration of medication-related side effects.Level of evidence Expert opinion.Benefits The addition of basal insulin is considered if HbA1c does not reach 7.0% within 3 to 4 months of metformin monotherapy [257,700].A stepwise approach can be used in individuals with poor glycemic control, as intensive glycemic control is essential to prevent complication development.A high basal insulin dose of about 1.5 U/kg may be required in children and ado - lescents with diabetes who exhibit insulin resistance.
If the combination of metformin and basal insulin does not achieve treatment goals, ultra-short-acting insulin should be adminis -Recommendation 20.7 If metformin alone does not achieve the glycemic goal, basal insulin should be used concomitantly. [Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 20.8 If metformin and basal insulin treatment do not achieve the glycemic goal, MDIs or insulin pumps should be used.[Expert opinion, general recommendation]Recommendation 20.4 Initial pharmacologic therapy can be started with metformin monotherapy, insulin monotherapy, or a combination of both.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Recommendation 20.5 Immediate insulin therapy should be considered if ketosis/ketonuria/ketoacidosis is present, the HbA1c is ≥8.5%, or the blood glucose level is ≥250 mg/dL.
[Expert opin - ion, general recommendation] Recommendation 20.6 For children and adolescent diabetics without diabetes symptoms and an HbA1c level of <8.5%, treat - ment can be started with metformin alone. [Expert opinion, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea661 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgtered before meals to achieve an HbA1c level below 7.0%.Cur - rently, several drugs for pediatric diabetes treatment are un - dergoing clinical trials [714,715].International guidelines rec - ommend administering other oral antidiabetic drugs, such as GLP-1RAs, when target HbA1c is not reached [257,700].However, in Korea, GLP-1RA, SGLT2 inhibitors, and DPP-4 inhibitors are not yet approved for pediatric T2DM treatment; it is necessary to continue to take notice of approvals of such drugs.
When adding any of the above drugs, it is important to consider factors such as the degree of glycemic reduction, mechanism of action, cost, method of administration, licen - sure, side effects, and impact on comorbidities of these drugs. Risks The challenges associated with adding insulin when glucose control is inadequate include potential decreases in adherence and risks associated with insulin use, such as hypoglycemia and weight gain.The use of other oral antidiabetic drugs re - quire further validation for their effectiveness and safety.Balancing the benefits and risks When used alone, metformin is not effective in controlling blood glucose levels in about 50% of cases, necessitating the addition of insulin with evaluation on hypoglycemia and ad - herence individually.With recent active clinical research on secondary medications in children and adolescents, it is crucial to be well-informed about their approval status in the country.
Level of evidence RCTs and non-RCTs demonstrating the effectiveness of lira - glutide and bariatric surgery in obese children and adolescents with T2DM were included as evidence. Benefits Liraglutide may be used to treat youth with T2DM who are at least 12 years of age and have stage 2 obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2 or ≥120% of the 95th percentile) [716].Bariatric surgery may be considered if glycemic control is inadequate with pharma - cologic therapies or in the presence of severe comorbidities.Experienced surgeons should perform this surgery on selected few individuals who have completed growth spurts in a hospi - tal with a multidisciplinary team capable of pediatric postop - erative management.Bariatric surgery in individuals with un - controlled T2DM has been associated with better glycemic control, more significant weight loss, and better outcomes for other complications, including diabetic nephropathy, com - pared to pharmacologic therapies [717-719].
Risks GI side effects are common with liraglutide. A thorough dis - cussion is necessary before deciding on bariatric surgery, as several complications, such as nutrient deficiencies, may occur after the surgery.There are reports that bariatric surgery does not affect growth in individuals who have not completed growth spurts [720], but further studies are needed.Further - more, data on long-term follow-up of pediatric people under - going surgery is lacking.Balancing the benefits and risks The decision to use liraglutide or to perform bariatric surgery in children and adolescents with T2DM should be made care - fully.Level of evidence Expert opinion.Benefits Newly diagnosed T2DM is often accompanied by comorbidi - ties or diabetic complications and should be screened at the time of initial diagnosis [257,700].Y ounger-onset T2DM is as - sociated with more severe microvascular and macrovascular complications than later-onset T2DM [708].
Therefore, in in -Recommendation 20.9 Liraglutide can be administered to youth aged ≥12 years with T2DM who have a stage II or higher obesity (≥120% of the 95th percentile of BMI). [Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] Recommendation 20.10 Poor glycemic control or presence of co - morbidities in youth with T2DM who have a stage II or higher obesity (≥120% of the 95th percentile of BMI) may require bariat - ric surgery with considerations to the growth state of the youth.[Non-randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation]Recommendation 20.11 For youth with T2DM, routine evaluation of comorbidities and microvascular complications is conducted starting at the time of diagnosis.[Uncontrolled studies, general rec - ommendation] Recommendation 20.12 For youth with T2DM, routine assessments for depression, anxiety, eating disorders, sleep apnea, and sleep disor - ders should be conducted.
[Expert opinion, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.662 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgdividuals diagnosed with T2DM in childhood or adolescence, screening for microvascular complications (nephropathy, reti - nopathy, and neuropathy) should be conducted at the time of diagnosis, and routine yearly testing for early detection of complications is recommended. Blood pressure should be measured every clinic visit, and fasting lipids and liver function tests are recommended yearly.Evaluation for sleep apnea and polycystic ovary syndrome is also necessary, and comorbidities of T2DM should be treated accordingly.Individuals diagnosed with diabetes in childhood and adolescence are at increased risk of developing depression, anxiety, and eating disorders, which can negatively impact dia - betes management.Therefore, detailed history-taking and routine evaluation is essential.Risks Diagnosis of diabetes complications may be delayed if routine screening is not performed.
Comorbidities detected by screen - ing must be treated accordingly, with consideration to medica - tions approved for each age group. Balancing the benefits and risks Routine screening for comorbidities and diabetes complica - tions in children and adolescents with T2DM is crucial, and the identified diseases should be treated accordingly.Level of evidence Expert opinion.Benefits Physicians treating children and adolescents with T2DM should begin preparing for the transition from pediatric to adult diabe - tes care during adolescence, at least 1 year before the transition.This transition period is a high-risk period as interruption of care is likely to occur.Poor glycemic control, increased risk for acute and chronic complications, and psychological and emo - tional problems may arise during this period [721].Both pediat - ric and adult healthcare providers should provide support and resources to young adults transitioning into adult care.
The exact timing of transition is decided upon by the healthcare provider and the transitioning individual. When adequately prepared, the transition from pediatric to adult diabetes care is less likely to be challenging and the interruption of care is minimized.Risks Recommendations for transitioning from pediatric to adult care for T2DM are similar to those for pediatric T1DM, due to the insufficient studies on this subject.Balancing the benefits and risks The transition process of young adults with T2DM is thought to be similar to that of young adults with T1DM, since the course of transition is not influenced by the type of diabetes.Recommendation 20.13 Y outh with T2DM should be transferred to an adult clinic at an appropriate time.[Expert opinion, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea663 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.org21.CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING AND INSULIN PUMPS 1.
CGM results should be analyzed using international standardized core metrics and their criteria, as well as the ambulatory glucose profile (AGP).

[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 5. For adults with diabetes on insulin therapy where constant use of rtCGM is not desired or available, or for adults with T2DM on noninsulin therapy, periodic use of rtCGM can be employed for blood glucose management.[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 6.Pregnant individuals with T1DM should use rtCGM as close to daily as possible to maintain optimal blood glucose levels, reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, and improve gestational outcomes.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 7.Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems should be offered to all adults with T1DM who can use the device safely to reduce the risk of hy - poglycemia as well as HbA1c levels.[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 8.
For adults with T1DM who are at high risk of hypoglycemia despite constant use of CGM and unable to use AID systems, sensoraugmented pumps with low-glucose suspend (LGS) feature should be used to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 9.For adults with T1DM who cannot use an AID system or a sensoraugmented insulin pump, and for adults with poorlycontrolled T2DM with multiple daily insulin injections, multiple daily insulin injections and conventional insulin pumps have similar efficacy.The choice be - tween these two treatment methods should be individualized based on each individual’s preferences, and medical and socioeconomic cir - cumstances.[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] Recommendation 21.1 CGM results should be analyzed using international standardized core metrics and their criteria, as well as the AGP .
[Non-randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Level of evidence The studies included in the analysis are three observational studies [722-724]. All are retrospective cohort studies, and the level of evidence is very low.The recommendation range is as - sessed as a general recommendation.Benefits In 2019, international guidelines were published on the use of core metrics for interpreting CGM and the AGP [119].These guidelines specify the AGP report as the standard template for interpreting CGM data.The studies on the target values did not include Korean participants; therefore, whether the same crite - ria can be applied to Koreans can be evaluated based on obser - vational studies conducted in Korea.
In one Korean study, the coefficient of variation was shown to have an inverse correlation with the minimum glucose level re - corded by a 3-day CGM in both people with T1DM and T2DM and a coefficient of variation of 36% appeared to be a helpful predictor for minimum glucose level of below 70 mg/dL in Ko - reans with diabetes [722]. Furthermore, in a study conducted in Moon JS, et al.664 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgKoreans with T1DM, among various core metrics of CGM, the TBR (<54 mg/dL) was most strongly associated with CAN, supporting the international guidelines that categorize hypogly - cemia into two stages and define clinically significant hypogly - cemia as below 54 mg/dL [723].In addition, the TIR (70 to 180 mg/dL) was significantly associated with the presence of pro - teinuria in Korean adults with T2DM, supporting international guidelines based on the association between TIR and microvas - cular complications [724].
Moreover, the AGP report visually presents glucose levels over time in a standardized format, ac - cumulated for more than 14 days. Risks No target CGM metrics are proposed for pregnancy in T2DM, gestational diabetes, and prediabetes due to insufficient evi - dence from studies, and the benefits and risks of applying the same target range to these individuals have not been evaluated.In the cohort study from 2016 to 2018 of the T1D Exchange, a large T1DM cohort in the United States, it was observed that despite the expanded use of CGM and insulin pumps, there was no decrease in HbA1c levels or the incidence of SH com - pared to the cohort study from 2010 to 2012 [725].
These find - ings suggest that the consistent benefits of CGM and insulin pumps demonstrated in various clinical trials cannot be repli - cated in clinical practice by simply increasing the supply of these devices alone, and that the systematic education provided along with the device in these trials is necessary for those bene - fits to be replicated. In the clinical trials that form the basis for each recommendation, for individuals undergoing intensive insulin therapy such as multiple daily insulin injections or insu - lin pumps, these educations were provided through a special - ized educational system, going beyond the scope of typical dia - betes education.It included training on the correct use of de - vices and the proper interpretation of the information obtained from these devices to apply it to their treatment.The partici -pants in these studies consistently used CGM on a daily basis, checking the information in real-time.
In almost all studies, the percentage of time CGM is active showed a significant correla - tion with the benefits obtained from the study (refer to each recommendation text). For those not on intensive insulin therapy, their education did not significantly deviate from the scope of typical diabetes man - agement education, but the subjects retrospectively received help from experts to interpret the information obtained through the devices (professional CGM).Some studies also involved the subjects checking the information obtained from the devices in real-time (real-time feedback).This form of CGM was not con - tinuous but was conducted periodically over a certain period (typically several days to 2 weeks) (refer to each recommenda - tion text).Level of evidence Eight RCTs with a primary outcome of HbA1c reduction [550, 726-732] and seven RCTs with a primary outcome of reduced hypoglycemia [553,733-738] in adults with T1DM were in - cluded in the analysis.
One RCT compared a conventional rt - CGM to an isCGM [739]. Blinding was not maintained due to the nature of device-worn studies, which precluded the use of a placebo.However, the risk of bias from other sources was low enough that the same conclusions could be drawn from these studies; therefore, the level of evidence was assessed as high and the recommendation range as a general recommendation.Benefits Of the eight RCTs [550,726-732] with HbA1c reduction as the primary outcome, all but one [728], which provided inade - quate education in adults with T1DM from low-income fami - lies, showed significant HbA1c reduction.In all seven RCTs [553,733-738] with hypoglycemia as the primary outcome, the use of CGM with appropriate education significantly reduced the frequency of hypoglycemia in adults with T1DM on multi - ple insulin injections or insulin pumps.
This effect was demon - strated regardless of baseline HbA1c level [738], even in indi - viduals with adequate baseline HbA1c [736,738]. This was also proven for individuals with hypoglycemia unawareness or fre -Recommendation 21.2 The clinical benefits of CGM and insulin pumps can only be expected when the user accurately uses these devices and has received education on how to appropriately apply the information obtained to glucose management.For adults who intend to use multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pumps, such education should be provided professionally and systemati - cally through a team of diabetes specialists.[Non-randomized con - trolled trial, general recommendation]Recommendation 21.3 All adults with T1DM should use rtCGM as close to daily as possible to manage blood glucose levels and minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.
[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea665 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgquent SH, where the risk of death from hypoglycemia is in - creased, regardless of whether they used insulin pumps or multiple daily insulin injections [553,735]. Consistent benefits have also been shown with isCGM, as well as conventional rt - CGM [733].However, in an RCT comparing conventional rtCGM with isCGM, the conventional rtCGM was superior in TBR (<70 mg/dL) and TIR (70 to 180 mg/dL) [739].Therefore, in T1DM, when isCGM does not provide sufficient benefits, convention - al rtCGM is recommended.Risks Most CGM devices, except for implantable ones, can cause contact dermatitis as they need to be attached to the skin.To date, no studies have shown an increase in the frequency of hy - poglycemia when using scanned CGM instead of SMBG.
Giv - en the high morbidity and mortality of T1DM and the in - creased severe-hypoglycemia-related mortality, the benefits of CGM in reducing HbA1c and reducing hypoglycemia far out - weigh the harm. Since there are no side effects other than con - tact dermatitis, which can be controlled through the identifica - tion and removal of allergens in most cases, CGM with proper education can be recommended in all adults with T1DM.Level of evidence Six RCTs were analyzed.Due to the nature of studies involving the wearing of devices, the use of a placebo was not possible, and blinding was not maintained in all randomized trials.However, studies with a low risk of bias for other reasons alone were able to draw the same conclusions, leading to the evidence being rated as high quality, but the recommendation range was considered a limited recommendation.
Benefits The DIAMOND study, an RCT of 158 adults with T2DM using multiple insulin injections, was performed with the change in HbA1c at 24 weeks as the primary outcome. In this study, mean HbA1c was 8.5% at baseline, 7.7% at 24 weeks in the CGM group, and 8.0% at 24 weeks in the control group, with a significant difference in HbA1c reduction between the two groups (adjusted difference in mean change, –0.3%; 95% CI, –0.5% to 0.0%; P=0.022).The groups did not differ in CGM- measured hypoglycemia and quality of life outcomes [740].This study used CGM as an adjunct to SMBG, not as a stand - alone, due to regulatory status at the time of study, and the con - trol group was also required to measure their blood glucose at least four times per day.In addition to SMBG, the CGM group received individualized recommendations from their physi - cians to reflect the trends of glucose levels identified by CGM into their glycemic control regimen [740].
A post hoc analysis of the study showed significant HbA1c reductions also in indi - viduals over the age 60 [551]. An RCT on 224 adults with T2DM using multiple insulin injections or insulin pumps was conducted to determine whether replacing SMBG with isCGM without specific educa - tion improves glycemic control.The primary outcome, HbA1c change at 6 months, did not show a significant difference be - tween the intervention (isCGM) and control groups.However, in participants younger than 65, the isCGM group showed a significantly greater HbA1c change.Of the secondary out - comes, hypoglycemia was reduced in the isCGM group, and treatment satisfaction was higher in the isCGM group than in the control group [741].An RCT was conducted to determine whether replacing SMBG with isCGM with specific education improves treat - ment satisfaction in adults with T2DM on multiple insulin in - jections.
The study found no significant difference in treatment satisfaction, the primary outcome, as assessed by the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire score ( P=0.053). The secondary outcome, HbA1c reduction, was 0.82% in the isC - GM group and 0.33% in the control group, showing a signifi - cant difference between the two groups ( P=0.005) [742].The Continuous Glucose MOnitoring in T2D Basal InsuLin UsErs (MOBILE) study, an RCT of 175 adults with T2DM treated with basal insulin without pre-prandial rapid-acting in - sulin in primary care practices, was conducted with HbA1c at 8 months as the primary outcome.The mean HbA1c of the CGM group was 9.1% at baseline and 8.0% at 8 months.In the control group, mean HbA1c was 9.0% at baseline and 8.4% at 8 months, showing a significant difference in HbA1c change be - tween the two groups (adjusted difference in mean change, –0.4%; 95% CI, –0.8% to 0.1%; P=0.02).
The mean CGM-mea - sured TIR of 70 to 180 mg/dL was 59% in the CGM group ver - sus 43% in the control group ( P<0.001) [743]. In a follow-up study, the 106 individuals initially assigned to the CGM group were reassigned either to continue CGM ( n=53) or discontin -Recommendation 21.4 Adults with T2DM on insulin injection regi - mens may use rtCGM as close to daily as possible to manage blood glucose levels.[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] Moon JS, et al.666 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgue CGM ( n=53).In the continued CGM group, the mean TIR increased from 44% at baseline to 56% at 8 months and 57% at 14 months, while the discontinued CGM group lost half of the initial gain in TIR (38% at baseline to 62% at 8 months and 50% at 14 months) [744].Thus, the MOBILE study demon - strates the need for CGM not only in people with diabetes on multiple insulin injection regimens but also in adults with T2DM treated with only basal insulin.
Although there has not yet been a domestic study exclusively targeting adults with T2DM who use only basal insulin, similar to the MOBILE study, an RCT evaluating the benefits of con - sistently using isCGM over 3 months among adults with T2DM who do not use multiple daily insulin injection therapy included a subset of such patients on basal insulin only. Of the study participants, 27.5% were on basal insulin, and 19 of the isCGM group (32.8%) and 14 (22.6%) of the control group used insulin.In this study, insulin use was not associated with HbA1c changes, but the increase in TIR and decrease in TBR was more pronounced in insulin users [745].Risks Due to their characteristic of being attached to the skin, all CGM devices can cause contact dermatitis.To date, no increase in the frequency of hypoglycemia has been reported when scanned CGM replaces SMBG.
As there are no adverse effects other than contact dermatitis, most of which can be controlled by identifying and eliminating the allergen, CGM with proper education can be recommended in adults with T2DM on mul - tiple insulin injection regimens. Alternatives and considerations Clinical trials have not tested the independent use of conven - tional rtCGM devices, without concomitant use of SMBG.The clinical trials on scanned CGM employed devices from a gen - eration that did not yet have real-time alarms features.Current generations of CGM devices, such as rtCGM used without SMBG and isCGM with real-time alarms, may provide addi - tional benefits than those demonstrated in these trials.Howev - er, no RCTs have been published to confirm this.Level of evidence Four RCTs were included in the analysis.Blinding was not maintained in all four studies due to the nature of the device- worn studies, which precluded the use of a placebo.
A 52-week follow-up study had missing values for the primary outcome in 33% of its participants [746,747]. In another study, the drop - out rate was 12%, higher than the expected 10%, and the fol - low-up period was 3 months [748].The level of evidence was rated as low for long-term outcomes, with limited recommen - dations.Benefits An RCT was conducted to evaluate whether intermittent use of CGM (2 weeks of use followed by a 1-week break) for 12 weeks improves glycemic control in adults with T2DM not us - ing pre-prandial rapid-acting insulin.The primary outcome was reduction in HbA1c at weeks 12 and 52 (weeks 12 through 52 were observed without CGM use).At the time of the study, rtCGM devices were not yet approved for independent use without SMBG, so they were used as an adjunct to SMBG and the CGM group was also required to check SMBG before meals and before bedtime as in the control group.
The results showed that rtCGM was significantly better than SMBG in re - ducing HbA1c at both 12 and 52 weeks [746,747]. An RCT conducted in Korea evaluated whether a monthly 3-day rtC - GM for 12 weeks could significantly reduce HbA1c in adults with T2DM [748].The study included 65 individuals with HbA1c levels of 8% to 10% on insulin or oral antidiabetic medication therapy.The rtCGM group was instructed to in - crease physical activity and adjust their diet in response to hy - perglycemia alerts (>300 mg/dL) and to verify with SMBG followed by correcting hypoglycemia in response to hypogly - cemia alerts (<60 mg/dL).Due to the characteristics of the rt - CGM device used at the time, participants were required to check SMBG at least 3 days each month for calibration.During CGM-free periods, the number of SMBG was not limited, while the control group was required to measure SMBG at least four times per week.
HbA1c decreased from 9.1%±1.0% to 8.0%±1.2% in the rtCGM group and from 8.7%±0.7% to 8.3%±1.1% in the control group, showing a greater reduction in HbA1c in the rtCGM group ( P=0.004) [748]. In both stud - ies, there was no significant difference in the frequency of hy - poglycemia between the rtCGM and control groups.In a study on Koreans with diabetes, the rtCGM group showed decreased calorie intake, body weight, BMI, and postprandial blood glu -Recommendation 21.5 For adults with diabetes on insulin thera - py where constant use of rtCGM is not desired or available, or for adults with T2DM on non-insulin therapy, periodic use of rtCGM can be employed for blood glucose management.[Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea667 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgcose levels and increased physical exercise time [748].
A recent study conducted in Korea assessed the benefits of consistent isCGM use for 3 months in 120 adults with T2DM, not on multiple insulin injections. In this study, the isCGM group was educated to improve their meal content if it consist - ed of unhealthy food or to reduce the quantity if the meal con - tent was healthy, upon observing postprandial glycemic excur - sions.The isCGM group showed a greater reduction in HbA1c than the control group (risk-adjusted difference, 20.50%; 95% CI, 20.74% to 20.26%; P<0.001) [745].In another Korean study, 61 adults with T2DM not on insu - lin were enrolled in an RCT to evaluate changes in HbA1c with rtCGM use.All participants used blinded CGM for 6 days with lifestyle education based on the ‘Pattern Snapshot Report’ be - fore randomization.The participants were then assigned to three groups: group 1 with one session of 7-day rtCGM, group 2 with two sessions of 7-day rtCGM with a 3-month interval between sessions, and a control group.
Compared to the con - trol group, only group 2 showed signification reduction in HbA1c at 6 months (adjusted difference=–0.68%; P=0.018). When evaluated based on the number of daily SMBG, partici - pants of group 1 and group 2 who checked SMBG at least 1.5 times per day had significant HbA1c reductions compared to control at 3 and 6 months.However, those with self-measure - ments of less than 1.5 times per day showed no significant im - provement.Compared to the control group, both group 1 (ad - justed difference=–0.60%; P=0.044) and group 2 (adjusted difference=–0.64%; P=0.014) showed significant reductions in HbA1c at 3 months, but only group 2 showed significant re - ductions at 6 months.The study was conducted using a rtCGM device that requires calibration with twice-daily SMBG mea - surements [749].Risks All CGM devices that must be attached to the skin can cause contact dermatitis.No increased frequency of hypoglycemia has yet been reported when SMBG is replaced with isCGM.
With no side effects other than contact dermatitis, most of which can be controlled by identifying and eliminating the al - lergen, CGM with structured education can be recommended in adults with T2DM. Alternatives and considerations Neither study was conducted with rtCGM alone without con - comitant SMBG, as currently practiced.The recent generation of devices, including rtCGM used without SMBG and isCGM with real-time alarms, may provide additional benefits than those demonstrated in these trials.However, no RCTs have been reported to confirm this.Rationale One RCT was included in the analysis [750].Blinding was not maintained due to the nature of the device-worn studies, which precluded the use of a placebo, but the risk of bias due to other causes was low; therefore, the level of evidence was assessed as high, and the recommendation range as a general recommen - dation.
Benefits The CGM in pregnant women with T1DM (CONCEPTT) study is an international, multicenter RCT to determine wheth - er rtCGM could improve glycemic control and obstetric out - comes in 215 pregnant individuals with T1DM and gestational age of 13 weeks and 6 days or lower on multiple insulin injec - tions or insulin pumps [750]. Both the intervention group (rt - CGM plus SMBG) and the control group (SMBG alone) per - formed at least seven SMBG measurements per day, as inde - pendent use of CGM was not approved at that time.The pri - mary outcome was the reduction in HbA1c from baseline to gestational age of 34 weeks; a significantly greater reduction was observed in the intervention group (mean difference, –0.19%; 95% CI, –0.34% to –0.03%; P=0.0207).TIR (63 to 140 mg/dL) was 68% in the intervention group and 61% in the con - trol group ( P=0.0034).The frequency of SH and TBR did not differ between the two groups.
In the intervention group, the number of LGA infant births was reduced by 49%, neonatal in - tensive care unit admissions were reduced by 52%, neonatal hy - poglycemia was reduced by 55%, and duration of hospitaliza - tion was reduced by 1 day. The same study design was replicat - ed in individuals with T1DM who were planning pregnancy, but no significant difference was observed between groups [750].Unlike the benefits of CGM in pregnant individuals with T1DM, the benefits of periodic rtCGM and retrospective CGM in individuals with gestational diabetes or preexisting T1DM or Recommendation 21.6 Pregnant individuals with T1DM should use rtCGM as close to daily as possible to maintain optimal blood glu - cose levels, reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, and improve gestational outcomes.[Randomized controlled trial, general recommendation] Moon JS, et al.668 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgT2DM during pregnancy are unclear.
An RCT of 6-day rtCGM use at the gestational age of 8, 12, 21, 27, and 33 weeks in 123 pregnant individuals with T1DM and 31 pregnant individuals with T2DM, did not show a difference in glycemic and obstet - ric outcomes, including the number of LGA infant births [751]. Additionally, studies utilizing retrospective CGM, which lever - ages CGM data during professional consultations at intervals of 1 to 4 weeks either between 24–28 weeks or 28–36 weeks of pregnancy, failed to demonstrate benefits in adults with gesta - tional diabetes during 24–28 weeks of pregnancy [752].Risks The most common adverse event reported in the CONCEPTT study was a skin reaction, which occurred in 49 (48%) of the 103 CGM-users and eight (8%) of the 104 in the control group.Since contact dermatitis is often controllable with the identifi - cation and removal of the allergen, CGM with proper educa - tion can be recommended in adults with T1DM.
Rationale The analysis included three RCTs and one observational study with a 1-year follow-up period. Blinding was not maintained in all the RCTs due to the nature of the device-wearing studies, which precluded the use of a placebo, but the same conclusions could be drawn from the studies with a low risk of bias from other causes; therefore, the quality of evidence was assessed as high.Benefits The AID system is designed to automatically adjust the basal insulin infusion rate based on glucose levels obtained from CGM, striving for a more physiologic insulin secretion pattern.The system currently used in the clinic has not yet achieved fully automated insulin secretion, and is also referred to as hy - brid closed-loop, as it requires the patient to manually input information on meals (carbohydrate counting) for the injec - tion of the mealtime bolus dose.To date, RCTs using various devices and algorithms have shown reductions in HbA1c and increases in time spent in the target range.
In 2018, the results of a multicenter RCT of 86 adults with uncontrolled T1DM at baseline in the United States and the United Kingdom were reported. The use of a hybrid closed- loop device (CAMAPS FX, CamDiab, Cambridge, UK) signifi - cantly improved the primary outcome of TIR (70 to 180 mg/ dL) at week 12 at 65%±8% compared to 54%±9% in the con - trol group and no SH occurred.The control group used sen - sor-augmented insulin pumps, and all study participants re - ceived training on proper insulin adjustment and device use during a 4-week run-in period [753].In 2019, the results of the International Diabetes Closed Loop (iDCL) trial, a multicenter RCT comparing the efficacy and safety of sensor-augmented insulin pump and a hybrid closed- loop device (CONTROL-IQ, Tandem Diabetes Care, San Di - ego, CA, USA) in 168 adults with T1DM, were reported [754].
The hybrid closed-loop device used in the study used a model predictive control algorithm, which releases an automatically calibrated bolus up to 1 hour when blood glucose is expected to rise above 180 mg/dL after 30 minutes with peak basal insulin infusion rate. A separate glycemic goal was established for night-time and exercise.The primary outcome was TIR (70 to 180 mg/dL) at week 26, which was 61%±17% at baseline, 71%±12% at week 26 in the hybrid closed-loop group, and 59%±14% at week 26 in the sensor-augmented insulin pump group, demonstrating significant differences in the outcome (mean adjusted difference, 11% points; 95% CI, 9 to 14; P<0.001).There were no cases of SH in either group.Partici - pants with prior use of insulin pumps or CGM had a run-in pe - riod of 2 to 8 weeks before randomization [754].
In a post hoc analysis of the study, the benefit of the hybrid closed-loop de - vice was demonstrated regardless of prior CGM or insulin pump use, and the benefits were greater in those with lower baseline TIR. Additional benefits of a more complete glycemic control were demonstrated in those with excellent baseline HbA1c and TIR [755-757].In a real-world observational study of Medtronic’s Minimed 670G device (Minneapolis, MN, USA), the first commercially available hybrid closed-loop device, a significant correlation between time spent in auto-mode (the mode in which basal in - sulin infusion dose is automatically adjusted) and HbA1c was observed in the 1-year follow-up period.
However, towards the end of the follow-up period, the time spent in auto-mode de - creased, and the time spent in manual mode increased, partic - ularly due to the forced shutdown of auto-mode when hyper - glycemia above a certain threshold that could not be counter - acted by adjusting the basal insulin infusion rate occurred Recommendation 21.7 AID systems should be offered to all adults with T1DM who can use the device safely to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia as well as HbA1c levels. [Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea669 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.org[758].In 2021, the Fuzzy Logic Automated Insulin Regulation (FLAIR) study, an RCT that compared the improvement in TIR of two Medtronic Minimed devices, was reported.
The two devices were Medtronic’s Minimed 780G device, which used an algorithm that delivers small bolus injections every 5 minutes without forcible shutdown of the auto-mode, and the original Minimed 670G device. The Minimed 780G group re - duced the primary outcome of time above the target range (>180 mg/dL) from 42% to 34% while maintaining TBR (<54 mg/dL) at 0.46%, a significant improvement compared to the Minimed 670G group (time above the target range of 37% and TBR of 0.50%).The TIR also differed significantly between the two groups, being 57% at the start of the study, 63% for the Minimed 670G, and 67% for the Minimed 780G at the end of the study.In particular, the time spent in auto-mode was 75% for the Minimed 670G and 86% for the Minimed 780G, and the number of forced shutdowns of auto-mode was 5.7 times per week for the Minimed 670G and 1.7 times per week for the Minimed 780G [759].
The Minimed 780G did not show supe - rior results over the Minimed 670G in improving glucose levels within 3 hours of a meal. However, the Minimed 780G proved to better control overnight glucose levels and glucose 3 hours after a meal, with no difference in pre- or post-meal glycemic control [760].Another RCT also demonstrated significant benefits of hybrid closed-loop device (Minimed 780G) use in individuals with no prior experience with CGM or insulin pump [761], and the benefit of Minimed 670G was significant in adults with T1DM aged 60 years or older [762].A common finding in all of the above hybrid closed-loop studies was that based on CGM data, when compared to the control, the degree of glycemic improvement was greatest at night.Furthermore, with adequate training, including instruc - tions on manual mode insulin pump use, significant gains were seen in all adults with T1DM.
Therefore, the use of AID systems can be recommended for all adults with T1DM, not just in a selected population, given that training by qualified healthcare professionals can be provided and the devices used safely, with consideration to socioeconomic status. Risks Sensor-augmented insulin pumps and hybrid closed-loop de - vices share the same risks as insulin pumps, including the risk of DKA due to infusion set failure.In two separate internation - al multicenter clinical trials of hybrid closed-loop devices, DKA due to infusion set failure occurred in one participant in the hybrid closed-loop group [753,754].Individuals with prior education about insulin therapy, CGM, and insulin pumps are thought to have a reduced risk of hypoglycemia without worsening glycemic control (sensor- augmented insulin pumps) or with improved glycemic control (hybrid closed-loop).
However, as with any insulin pump, in - dividuals without education on device care and intensive insu - lin therapy may continue to carry risks, such as DKA. Alternatives and considerations Given that the large RCTs that successfully demonstrated the efficacy and safety of AID systems have typically had a run-in period of 4 to 8 weeks to ensure adequate education on device care and insulin management, it is important to explain the practical expectations and safe use of AID systems to unedu - cated patients.Level of evidence The studies included in the analysis were two RCTs and one observational study with a 1-year follow-up period about sen - sor-augmented insulin pumps and two RCTs and one observa - tional study with a 1-year follow-up period about hybrid closed-loop devices.
Blinding was not maintained in all RCTs due to the nature of the device-worn studies, which precluded the use of a placebo, but the same conclusions could be drawn from the studies with a low risk of bias for other causes; there - fore, the level of the evidence was assessed as high and the rec - ommendation range as limited. Benefits In general, in adults with T1DM who are appropriately educat - ed for CGM use, multiple insulin injections and insulin pumps provide equivalent effects on glycemic control and hypoglyce - mia risk reduction; therefore, both can be recommended [763].However, in adults with T1DM who are still at high risk of hy - poglycemia despite CGM use, sensor-augmented insulin pumps with algorithms to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia may be considered.
One type of such device, a sensor-augmented pump in sync with CGM that discontinues insulin infusion Recommendation 21.8 For adults with T1DM who are at high risk of hypoglycemia despite constant use of CGM and unable to use AID systems, sensor-augmented pumps with LGS feature should be used to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [Randomized controlled trial, limited recommendation] Moon JS, et al.670 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orgwhen blood glucose level falls below a certain threshold (LGS) or is predicted to fall after 30 minutes (predictive low-glucose suspend [PLGS]), was approved by the U.S.FDA in the mid- 2010s.PLGS-type sensor-augmented insulin pumps have been approved and are being used in practice in Korea.The Automa - tion to Simulate Pancreatic Insulin Response (ASPIRE) trial, which included 247 adults with T1DM with nocturnal hypo - glycemia, evaluated whether an LGS-type sensor-augmented insulin pump could reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia.
The study showed that the use of sensor-augmented insulin pumps re - duced the primary outcome of 3-month nocturnal hypoglyce - mia without an increase in HbA1c [732,764]. All participants had a 2-week run-in period, and only those who had at least two episodes of nocturnal hypoglycemia (<65 mg/dL) lasting at least 20 minutes during this run-in period were randomized.The PLGS for Reduction Of LOw Glucose (PROLOG) study was a randomized crossover trial comparing the use of sensor- augmented insulin pumps for a total of 6 weeks, in which a PLGS algorithm was used for half of this period.The primary outcome was % of TBR of <70 mg/dL, and PLGS algorithm use reduced the primary outcome by 31% without rebound hyper - glycemia [765].In the analysis of this study, the reduction in hypoglycemia was consistently observed both during the day and at night [48].
In a real-world observational study (median follow-up 12 months [range, 6 to 18]) on the benefits of long- term use of sensor-augmented insulin pumps with PLGS algo - rithms, the reduction in hypoglycemia was sustained for 12 months [766]. Risks Sensor-augmented insulin pumps and hybrid closed-loop de - vices essentially share the same risks as insulin pumps, includ - ing the risk of DKA due to infusion set failure.In two separate international multicenter clinical trials of hybrid closed-loop devices, DKA due to infusion set failure occurred in one par - ticipant in the hybrid closed-loop group [753,754].Individuals with prior education about insulin therapy, CGM, and insulin pumps are thought to have a reduced risk of hypoglycemia without worsening glycemic control (sensor-augmented insu - lin pumps) or with improved glycemic control (hybrid closed- loop).
However, as with any insulin pump, individuals without education on device care and intensive insulin therapy may continue to carry risks, such as DKA.Alternatives and considerations The expected benefit of a sensor-augmented insulin pump with a basal insulin infusion discontinuation algorithm is hypogly - cemia reduction, not HbA1c reduction. Hybrid closed-loop de - vices have both hypoglycemia and HbA1c reducing effects but are more costly.Thus, sensor-augmented pumps with LGS/ PLGS feature may be a viable alternative for adults with T1DM at high risk of hypoglycemia despite CGM use, who do not have the socioeconomic means to use an AID system or do not want to use an AID system due to alarms from the device.
As with hybrid closed-loop devices, given that the large RCTs that suc - cessfully demonstrated the efficacy and safety of these devices have typically had a run-in period of 4 to 8 weeks to ensure ad - equate education on device care and insulin management, it is necessary to explain to patients who are not sufficiently educat - ed that they need the ability to manage the device safely with realistic expectations regarding this device. Level of evidence For T1DM, five RCTs were included in the analysis.Due to the nature of the device-wearing studies, which precluded the use of a placebo, blinding was not maintained in all five of these studies, However, the same conclusions could be drawn from the studies with a low risk of bias for other causes; therefore, the level of evidence was assessed as high and the recommen - dation range as limited.For T2DM, the analysis included four RCTs with usual edu - cation [767-770] and one RCT with intensive education [771].
Blinding was not maintained in all of these trials due to the na - ture of device-wearing studies, which precluded the use of a placebo. However, the risk of bias due to other causes was low; therefore, the level of evidence was assessed as high, and the recommendation range as limited.Benefits A 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs compar -Recommendation 21.9 For adults T1DM who cannot use an AID system or a sensor-augmented insulin pump, and for adults with poorly-controlled T2DM with multiple daily insulin injections, multiple daily insulin injections and conventional insulin pumps have similar efficacy.The choice between these two treatment meth - ods should be individualized based on each individual’s preferences, and medical and socioeconomic circumstances.
[Randomized con - trolled trial, limited recommendation] 2023 Clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in Korea671 Diabetes Metab J 2024;48:546-708 https://e-dmj.orging insulin pumps to multiple insulin injections in adults with T1DM without CGM were reported [264]. In these studies, in - sulin pump use was associated with greater HbA1c reduction than multiple insulin injections.However, this result was strongly influenced by one study with a high dropout rate [772], and there was no difference when only the other three studies were analyzed [773-775].Secondary endpoints of hy - poglycemia frequency and weight gain showed similar results, and improvement in quality of life was better in the insulin pump group [772-775].In 2017, the results of the Relative Ef - fectiveness of Pumps Over MDI and Structured Education (REPOSE) trial, including 317 adults with T1DM in the United Kingdom, were reported.
This trial compared HbA1c reduc - tions at 2 years after equally providing current insulin dose management education to the MDIs and insulin pump groups. The results did not show a significant difference in HbA1c re - duction at 2 years between the two groups, but the insulin pump group showed superior treatment satisfaction [776].In a meta-analysis that included only studies with ≥6 months’ du - ration of insulin pump use and SH frequency greater than 10 episodes per 100 patient-years on MDI, the insulin pump group showed significant reductions in SH, compared to the MDI group (rate ratio, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.45 to 5.76) [777].Prob - lematic hypoglycemia, defined as two or more episodes per year of SH or one or more episodes of SH associated with hy - poglycemia unawareness, extreme glycemic variability, or mal - adaptive behavior, is likely to exceed the criteria for inclusion in these studies [778], in which case insulin pump use may be recommended independently of CGM.
In general, RCTs in adults with T2DM have shown similar HbA1c-reducing effects and hypoglycemia frequencies with in - sulin pump use and multiple insulin injections [767-770]. The OpT2mise study was an RCT comparing the effects on glyce - mic control of insulin pumps and multiple insulin injections in adults with uncontrolled T2DM despite multiple insulin injec - tion therapies.The study was conducted after a 2-month run-in period to titrate the multiple insulin injection therapy doses.The primary outcome was HbA1c reduction at 6 months, com - pared to the baseline.HbA1c reduction was 1.1% (standard de - viation [SD], 1.2%) in the insulin pump group and 0.4% (SD, 1.1%) in the multiple insulin injection group, showing a signifi - cant difference between the groups ( P<0.0001).
At the end of the study, the total daily insulin requirement was 97 units in the insulin pump group and 122 units in the multiple insulin injec - tion group, demonstrating a more significant reduction in insu -lin requirement in the insulin pump group. There was no differ - ence in the frequency of DKA or SH [771].Overall, in adults with T1DM who cannot use AID systems or sensor-augmented insulin pumps and in adults with uncon - trolled T2DM despite multiple insulin injection therapy, there was no difference in HbA1c reduction and hypoglycemia fre - quency reduction between multiple insulin injections and in - sulin pumps, no one therapy showing superiority over the oth - er.Therefore, in these populations, the choice of which modal - ity to use depends on personal preference, accessibility to healthcare (including healthcare providers who can provide professional education), and socioeconomic status (as insulin pumps are relatively expensive).
Risks All insulin pumps carry a risk of DKA due to infusion set fail - ure. Studies demonstrating the benefit of independent insulin pump use over multiple insulin injections in adults with T2DM not using CGM were conducted with 8 weeks of inten - sive training to titrate the multiple insulin injection doses prior to the studies; therefore, these modalities should be used in in - dividuals who have a good understanding of multiple insulin injections and can safely use insulin pumps.CONFLICTS OF INTEREST No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was re - ported.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Conception or design: J.S.M., S.K., J.H.C., K.A.L., J.H.M., S.C., D.J.K., H.J.K., J.A.S., M.K.K., J.H.L., Y .J.S., Y .S.Y ., J.H.K., Y .B.L., J.N., K.Y .H., J.S.P ., S.Y .R., H.J.K., H.M.K., J.H.K., N.H.K., C.H.K., J.A., T.J.O., S.K.K., J.K., E.H., S.M.J., J.B., E.J., J.M.K., S.M.K., J.H.P ., J.S.Y ., B.S.C., M.K.M., B.W .L.
