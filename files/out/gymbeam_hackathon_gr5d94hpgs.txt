Breunnerite was the sample mo st enriched in light Mg isotopes, and the25Mg/24Mg value of the ﬂuid had shifted lower by ~0.38 ‰than the initial value (set to 0 ‰) before dolomite precipitation.As a simple model, the Mg2+ ﬁrst precipitated in phyllos ilicates, followed by dolomite precipitation, at which time ~76 −87% of Mg2+had been removed from the primordial brine.A minor amount of phyllosilicate precipi tation continued after dolomite pre- cipitation.The element composition pro ﬁles of the latest solution that inter- acted with the cation exchange pool of R yugu were predominantly Na-rich.
Na+ acts as a bulk electrolyte and contribute s to the stabilization of the negative surface charge of phyllosilicat es and organic matter on Ryugu. Samples from the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu are the freshest among extraterrestrial carbonaceous materials1–3.R y u g u ’s chemical composition, which corresponds to an Ivuna-type carbo- naceous (CI) chondrite, suggests that a unique combination of sec- ondary minerals formed by aqueous alteration of the parent body4–7.Aqueous alteration of carbonaceous chondrites is caused by the melting of ice accreted to the host rock by heating from radioactivedecay of radioisotopes such as 26Al, and in many cases, multi-stage formation events of phyllosilicates and carbonates occur over multiple generations as a result of water –rock reactions8,9.The mineralReceived: 7 October 2023 Accepted: 22 July 2024 Check for updates A full list of af ﬁliations appears at the end of the paper.

Nakamura et al.4has reported a chemical equilibrium model for the aqueous alteration of the Ryugu host rock reacting with water con-taining CO 2, HCl, and organic matter that indicates a solution rich in magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and chloride (Cl) ions in the earlystages of alteration 4.
Most of the constituents of CI chondrites are optically opaque matrices of secondary minerals8dominated by mixed phyllosilicates consisting of serpentine and saponite (81 –84 vol%) as well as magne- tite (6 –10%), sul ﬁdes (4 –7%), and carbonates ( < 3%)11.R y u g uh a sb e e n shown to be mineralogically similar to CI chondrites that have a pris-tine secondary mineral composition without terrestrial alteration 4,6 (see Table 1for carbon abundances and isotopic compositions). A representative secondary mineral type that can be used for dating andreconstruction of solute compositions is carbonate 6,12.T oo u rk n o w l - edge, CI chondrites contain four types of carbonate minerals, dolomite[CaMg(CO 3)2], breunnerite [(Mg, Fe, Mn)CO 3], calcite (CaCO 3), and siderite (FeCO 3), among which dolomite occurs most frequently13, and references therein.
Because carbonates can be dated by using the 53Mn-53Cr chronometer, which has a half-life of 3.7 Myr, they are valu- able minerals for recording both the time when liquid water was pre-sent and the carbonate precipitation conditions 6,13–17.R y u g ui s important not only for these chemical reaction modeling results describing the secondary mineral precipitates, but also because it represents the pristine bulk Solar System composition18,19and contains a high diversity of primordial soluble organic molecules5,20–25and soluble inorganic ions7. However, how the major elements were redistributed during aqueous alteration by dissolution of primaryminerals and precipitation of secondary minerals is still not fullyunderstood.Direct snapshots of the chemical evolution of ﬂuids dur- ing each dissolution and precipitation process are rare, except forobservations of precipitate grains and desiccated veins 25,26.
Magnesium, which is one of the most ubiquitous elements in the secondary minerals of carbonaceous chondrites, exhibits large mass- dependent isotope fractionation during solid-liquid partitioning because of the large relative mass differences among24Mg,25Mg, and 26Mg27,28. Because carbonates and clay minerals are known to experi- ence isotope fractionation at the time of their precipitation, the Mgisotope systematics of each partitioning process of the major carbo-nate and clay minerals are well calibrated 28–30.The Mg isotopic com- position ( δ25Mg) of the originating ﬂuid can therefore be reconstructed from that of the secondary minerals.One major difference amongmajor secondary minerals is that the isotope fractionation factors ( α)for carbonate ( α< 1) and clay ( α> 1) minerals are generally opposite in sign 28–30.
Because there are two species involved with opposite frac- tionation factors, the isotopic evolution of the residual liquid phasedepends on (1) which phase precipitates ﬁrst, (2) the values of the fractionation factors, and (3) the proportion of each precipitate. In addition, the ionic balance of the cation exchange pool of clay mineralscan be used to unravel the composition of the latest contacted aqu-eous solution because clay minerals quickly achieve exchange equili-brium with the liquid phase 31.In both experimental and natural samples, the Mg present in the exchange pool of phyllosilicates hasbeen reported to show negligible Mg isotopic fractionation duringadsorption and desorption with the ambient water 29,32; thus, the exchangeable fraction is another proxy that records the isotopiccomposition of the dissolved Mg.
The history of carbonaceous chon-drites, such as thermal processing, mass transport, and mixing in the early Solar System, has been reconstructed from the element and isotopic composition of sequential acid extracts of carbonaceouschondrites 33,34. To date, only one study has applied the sequential solvent extraction method to the exchangeable and acid-solublephases of Ryugu samples to characterize the inorganic components 7 (Supplementary Fig.S1).However, the carbonate assemblage andexchangeable cations from the Ryugu sample constitute an inorganicproxy of the aqueous alteration of the bedrock and indigenous rego-lith of the carbonaceous asteroid.In this study, we ﬁrst report the Mg isotopic composition of breunnerite grains precipitated during the aqueous alteration of Ryugu and those of sequential solvent leachates, which provide information on the chemical evolution of ﬂuids during the asteroid ’s history.
Second, we identify the main component cations of two sur-face samples from Ryugu (A0106 from the ﬁrst touchdown site, and C0107 from the second touchdown site; Fig. 1) that would have been partitioned their element compositions by aqueous alteration of theasteroid.We thereby obtain insights into the mode of precipitation ofsecondary minerals, the sources of dissolved cations, and the chemicalevolution of ﬂuids.Results and discussion Identi ﬁcation and chemical composition of breunnerite Carbonate grains picked from Ryugu C0002 (Figs.1,2)w e r ei d e n t i ﬁed by laser Raman micro-spectroscopy to have spectrum peak (Fig.2C) at 316.74 cm–1, which is a speci ﬁc feature of breunnerite (see also Sup- plementary Fig.S2).X-ray ﬂuorescence spectroscopy (XRF) spectra for the same grain also showed that its main components were Mg and Fe,with a small amount of Mn.The positions of the main laser Ramanmicroscopy peaks were then mapped spatially on the grain (Fig.2D and E).

2E) exhibit mostly homogeneous distributions; this result indicates that the grain is composed of a single mineralogy. The resultsof elemental measurements by quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after the microscopic analysis anddissolution of the grain in nitric acid (Table 2) showed that Fe/Mg was 0.319 ± 0.021 mol/mol.Other element compositions of breunnerite were Mn/Mg = 0.041 ± 0.001, Ca/Mg = 0.129 ± 0.010, and Na/Mg = 0.070 ± 0.001 mol/mol.Mg isotopic compositions In Ryugu, the sample most enriched in heavy Mg isotopes was the HF/HClO 4extract with a value of approximately –0.1‰(Fig.3), which constituted the residue of secondary mineral extraction.The samplemost enriched in light Mg isotopes was the C0002 breunnerite with avalue of –1.34‰(Fig.4).
In the other extracts, the δ 25Mg values were intermediate; the A0106 H 2O extract had a low δ25Mg value of –0.85‰, but the δ25M gv a l u ei nt h eC 0 1 0 7H 2O extract was similar to that of the exchangeable form in the NH 4Cl extract. In the ethylenediaminete- traacetic acid (EDTA) extracts of both A0106 and C0107, δ25Mg was around –0.7‰, whereas in the CH 3COOH extract, it was slightly higher at–0.5‰.Theδ25Mg value in the A0106 H 2O extract (Fig.3, Table 2) was comparable to those in the hot H 2O extracts obtained during sequential soluble organic matter (SOM) leaching ( –0.81‰and –0.80 ‰;F i g .3, Table 2).The δ25Mg values in the EDTA and CH 3COOH extracts of this sample are clearly lower than that of the HCOOHextract ( –0.3‰).The main target phase of the EDTA, CH 3COOH, and HCOOH extractions is carbonate, whereas in the HCl and HF/HClO 4 extracts for silicate minerals, δ25Mg values were –0.1‰to–0.2‰, values close to that of bulk chondrites (Fig.3).
The δ26Mg* value, the 26Mg excess resulting from26Al decay, in each leachate in this study and in the SOM leachates reported by Yoshimura et al.7are indis- tinguishable from 0 ‰within analytical uncertainty (Supplemen- tary Fig. S3).The EDTA fraction targets carbonates that are more soluble in acid than in CH 3COOH (e.g., the former is used for selective extraction of calcite, and the latter for selective extraction of dolomite, seeSupplementary Fig.S1).The plot of Ca/Mg versus δ 25Mg (Fig.5)s u g - gests that there is a contribution from the breunnerite component in the EDTA fraction.In contrast, the CH 3COOH fraction plots on a mixing line between the total digests of the Ryugu samples and dolomite; this Fig.1 | The carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu and sub-surface sampling after the arti ﬁcial crater formation.A Photograph of Ryugu taken with the ONC-T camera onboard the Hayabusa2 spacecraft from 6 km on 20 July 2018 (Credit: JAXA, Univ.

However, because CH 3COOH also partially dis- solves phyllosilicates (Supplementary Table S1), Mg derived fromphyllosilicates was also present in that fraction (Fig. 5).The HCl frac- tions are characterized by higher δ 25Mg and lower Ca/Mg comparedwith the four bulk digests of Ryugu samples35.The compositions of the sequential extracts with carbonate (dolomite and breunnerite) andphyllosilicate are used as mixing endmembers of Mg.The HF/HClO 4 fractions are not shown on the Ca/Mg plot because Ca was at the lowerlimit of detection.Fig.2 | Identi ﬁcation of a breunnerite grain from the asteroid (162173) Ryugu.AMicrographs of the two largest single-mineralogy breunnerite grains isolated from Ryugu C0002 and Bthe region of interest (ROI; within the dotted red line frame) of the larger of the two grains for non-destructive spectroscopy.The two breunnerite grains were ﬁrst assessed by non-destructive analysis.

The molar ratios of Mg, Ca, and Na+K to their sum areshown in a ternary diagram (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table S2), on which the contributions of Na+K and Mg range from 55% to 35%.The NH 4Cl extracts were characteristically even more enriched in Na and K thanthe H 2O extract.Alkali metals alone accounted for about 80% of the major cations among the exchangeable cations.This composition issimilar to the hot H 2O extract in the sequential SOM leaching7.The ternary diagram approach for examination of element par- titioning was not applied to the EDTA, CH 3COOH, and HF/HClO 4 extracts because Na contaminated all of the solutions after the ﬁrst leaching for carbonates with the solution prepared from EDTA di-sodium salt.This contamination is a necessary trade-off when car-bonates are extracted with weak acids.Note, however, that the SOM leaching results show that more than 90% of the alkali metals leach out in hot H 2O7.
Furthermore, Mg/(Mg+Fe) was low in the EDTA, CH3COOH, and HF/HClO 4extracts compared to that in the H 2Oa n d NH 4Cl extracts and below 70 after EDTA extraction, indicating that the dissolution of Fe-containing mineral phases had increased(Table 2). T h eM g / F ev a l u eo f2 .4 4 –2.47 mol/mol in EDTA extracts is rela- tively close to its value of 3.14 mol/mol in the C0002 breunnerite(Table 2).In contrast, Mg/Fe of the CH 3COOH extracts targeting dolomite is 1.20 –1.71 mol/mol, signi ﬁcantly lower than that of the breunnerite; this carbonate dissolution behavior is consistent with theCa/Mg and δ 25Mg results (Fig.5).The Mg/Fe value of the HCOOH extract in the SOM leaching ( ~ 2.4 mol/mol) is also close to the EDTA value, and the Mg/(Mg+Fe) of the EDTA extract of ~70 mol/mol is closeto that of the HCl extract of SOM leaching, which contains the phyl-losilicate fraction (Table 2).In the ternary diagram (Fig.
6), the ﬁnal residue after HF/HClO 4extraction is similar in composition to the SolarSystem abundances and the bulk composition of CI meteorites, as well as to the HCl extracts in the SOM leaching. 25Mg/24Mg homogeneity of bulk carbonaceous chondrites and mass-dependent Mg isotope fractionation in carbonates The abundances and isotopic compositions of C, N, and H using tens to hundreds of μg of the A0106 and C0107 samples used in this study are similar to previous analyses of CI chondrites from Ivuna and Orgueil(Table 1).Therefore, the in ﬂuence of lithological heterogeneity on the representativeness of the chemically extracted values for these light elements is expected to be small.Other values measured for CM2Murchison, Murray, Aguas Zarcas, CI Orgueil, and C2 ungTarda at similar weight scales are shown for comparison of chemical compo-sition.However, there is a variation of ~0.1 ‰in the Mg isotopic com- position of Ryugu 35.
Such variation is explained by the varying amount of carbonates in each aliquot18, indicating the effect of taking only small aliquots. Previous studies have reported relatively homogeneous Mg iso- topic compositions of δ25Mg = –0.15 ± 0.04 ‰(2σ)a n d δ26Mg = –0.28 ± 0.06 ‰(2σ) for carbonaceous, ordin ary, and enstatite chon- drites, including the nine chondrite groups (CI, CM, CO, CV, L, LL, H, EH, and EL)36,37.The compositional homogeneity of chondrites indicates that at the scale of bulk samples, the Mg isotopic compositions of their initialmaterials were similar and that mass -dependent isotop ef r a c t i o n a t i o n (δ 25Mg and δ26Mg) did not occur at the per mil level (Fig.3).δ26Mg is affected by the radioactive decay of26Al.However, the deviation should be on the order of tens of ppm and thus generally well below the mass-dependent variation observed on the 0.1 permil level.
To eliminatepotential radioactive decay effects, δ 25Mg, which is not affected by26Al decay, is used to examine Mg partiti oning in the aqueous alteration of Ryugu. Recently, small but resolvable25Mg/24Mg changes in bulk chon- drites have been reported by high-precision Mg isotope analyses35,38–41.However, the maximum extent of the variation is about 0.1 ‰,w h i c hi s sufﬁciently small compared with the magnitude of the δ25Mg variation observed in leachates and the single-mineralogy grains of this study.Bulk δ25Mg values of samples returned from Ryugu has been reported by Bizzarro et al.35(Fig.3).The δ25Mg values of four samples Fig.3 | Magnesium isotope pro ﬁles of the sequential extracts (H 2Ot oH F - HClO 4).Chemical fractions obtained in this study and in the SOM sequential leaching with 2 SD errors (hot H 2O, HCOOH, and HCl data are from Yoshimura et al.7; method after Naraoka et al.)5,7.
All data for HCOOH and HCl marked by asterisks and a part of the hot H 2O fraction (only Orgueil) have been published in Yoshimura et al.7. The yellow circle with the cross represents the data from the #5 H2O extract of CI-group Orgueil; these data are consistent with the #7 hot H 2O data (Supplementary Fig.S1).Exch.means exchangeable pool.The horizontal dashedline and gray band show the average of bulk values for the reference meteoritesand the 2 σerrors 37.The horizontal arrow indicates the general trend toward more soluble components; Supplementary Fig.S1 shows the minerals that each solvent targeted for extraction.Open circles represent high-precision δ25Mg reference data for carbonaceous chondrites (CC)38–41, and the blue-green circles represent the bulk data of four Ryugu grains and CI (Orgueil), CM, and CV meteorites reported by Bizzarro et al.35.
For many of these reference CC data (CI, CM, CV, CO, CK, CR) as well as for the bulk Ryugu grains, the 2SE measurement error is within the size ofthe symbol.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50814-y Nature Communications | (2024) 15:6809 5 ranged from –0.16 ± 0.02 ‰to–0.27 ± 0.03 ‰; thus, they are slightly lighter than most literature data of Ivuna-type (CI) and other carbo-naceous chondrite groups. Most of the Orgueil data reported by Biz-zarro et al.35also agree with the literature carbonaceous chondrite values, although one measurement is nearly identical to the lowestvalue of Ryugu 35.This variation in δ25Mg is attributable to the small sample size and is interpreted to re ﬂect heterogeneous sampling of isotopically lighter carbonates formed by low-temperature equili- brium processes with an endmember composition of about –1.40‰35.The bulk δ25Mg value of C0108, in which the carbonate in ﬂuence is small, is indistinguishable from that of bulk CI chondrites.
Here, theC0108 value of –0.16‰is adopted as the δ 25Mg value of Mg2+in the initial ﬂuid resulting from the dissolution of primary minerals during aqueous alteration, as will be shown later. In general, solutes extracted by chemically mild solvents are considered to have higher solubility and therefore to precipitate dur-ing later aqueous alteration stages.It should be noted that the pre-cipitation of minerals would have proceeded in the opposite order tothe extraction step sequence (Supplementary Fig.S1).The overall trend of our δ 25Mg composition results is that the more soluble com- ponents have lower values and, as the acidity of the extraction ﬂuid increases (i.e., for extraction of phyllosilicates and residues), δ25Mg becomes closer to the bulk composition (Fig.3).Furthermore, we successfully analyzed grains of breunnerite with a δ25Mg value of–1.34 ± 0.02 ‰(Fig.4).This value was obtained by dissolving the two grains shown in Fig.2A together.
Because of the high reactivity of Ryugu ’s phyllosilicates, it is dif ﬁcult to obtain carbonate δ25Mg by chemical extraction because even EDTA causes partial dissolution, so direct measurement of the isotope ratio of the microparticles is an effective technique. By considering isotopic fractionation factorsduring Mg-bearing carbonate precipitation, the process by which dis-solved Mg is removed from the ﬂuid can be reconstructed, as dis- cussed later.Note that the timing of precipitation can vary depending Fig.4 | Magnesium isotope systematics of the breunnerite grains (C0002) and leachates extracted from the aggregated samples (A0106 & C0107) and dolo-mite endmembers of Ryugu.Theδ 25Mg isotopic ratio ( ‰, vs.the DSM-3 standard with 2 SD errors) versus Mg/Fe (mol/mol) of the Ryugu C0002 breunnerite single- mineralogy grains.

Mixing curves of the calculated dolomite end component with the residual fraction and the mixing curve of the breunnerite with the residualfraction are shown in red and gray, respectively.Theoretical dolomite, whichdenotes the δ 25Mg value assuming direct uptake of the Mg2+resulting from the dissolution of the primary minerals, was calculated using the bulk composition of the C0108 sample ( δ25Mg = –0.16‰)35as the initial solution composition, the iso- tope fractionation factor42, and a precipitation temperature of 37 °C6.T h et h e o r e - tical Fe/Mg ratio of 12.5 mol/mol is the average value of the Ryugu samples4,12,43,65 (Supplementary Table S3).The Mg isotope ratio of the dolomite precipitated on Ryugu was calculated by Bizzarro et al.35(δ25Mg = –1.40‰,M g / C a=0 .9 1 )35,43.
Because the calculation method is affected by the Mg/Ca ratio of the dolomite,another potential endmember ( δ 25Mg = –1.33‰, Mg/Ca = 0.98) obtained by applying the Mg/Ca value of Fujiya et al.12is also shown. The Mg/Ca values reported by Nakato et al.65and Nakamura et al.4(not shown) are intermediate between those of Bazi et al.43and Fujiya et al.12(Supplementary Table S3).The effect of partial dissolution of labile phyllosilicates is found even in the EDTA extract (for selective dissolution of carbonates) resulting in low Mg/Fe and slightly high δ25Mg.The CH3COOH extracts show a particularly high contribution from phyllosilicates because of their greater acidity (Supplementary Table S1).Fig.5 | Mg isotope ratios with 2 SD errors and Ca/Mg molar ratios in the car-bonate and phyllosilicate leaching fractions, breunnerite, and dolomite.Values for bulk digests of the Ryugu aggregate samples were reported by Bizzarro et al.35.

The wine-colored cross indicates the chemical compositionof the ﬂuid in contact with the cation exchange pool of Ryugu, calculated using the partitioning coef ﬁcients for the major cations 31.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50814-y Nature Communications | (2024) 15:6809 6 on the Mg isotopic fractionation factor during dolomite precipitation and the partitioning ratio of Mg from solution to dolomite and phyl-losilicate (see Supplementary Information). The Mg in Ryugu ’ss e c - ondary minerals may have been derived mainly from Mg-rich olivineand pyroxene.Aqueous alteration of the Ryugu parent body is thoughtto have consisted of reactions between rocks and H 2Ow i t hC O 2and HCl4.Accretion of HCl-containing ice and the subsequent dissolution of primary minerals results in an initial ﬂuid composition rich in Mg and Fe, followed by neutralization of the solution, and serpentine,saponite, and carbonate precipitation, thereby transforming it into aNa-rich alkaline ﬂuid 10.
The precipitation order, including the pre- and post-sequence and the simultaneous precipitation of these secondaryminerals, is of interest for understanding the mode of supply and themovement of solutes into and their removal from the ﬂuid. Insights from Δ25Mg pro ﬁles and in situ temperature To determine the δ25Mg value of the calcifying ﬂuids, we sought to reconstruct the ﬂuid chemistry using the Δ25Mg of dolomite as follows: Δ25Mgdolomite /C0aq¼δ25Mgdolomite /C0δ25Mgaq≈103lnα ð1Þ where δ25Mg dolomite andδ25Mg aqare the Mg isotopic composition of the dolomite and aqueous solution, respectively, and αis the fractio- nation factor between the dissolved Mg and dolomite.Carbonatesobtained under natural conditions or by inorganic precipitation areenriched in 24Mg relative to the solution28.
The most common carbo- nate found in Ryugu as well as in CI chondrites is dolomite4.T h eM g extracted in the HCOOH extract averaged between A0106 and C0107was ~1160 μmol per gram of initial solid and was derived mainly from carbonates. By assuming that the Mg extract was derived from dis- solved carbonates and a W/R ratio of 0.2 –0.9 during the alteration 4, the Mg concentration of the solution was estimated to be 1 –5 mol/L.In this study, Δ25Mg dolomite-aq was calculated according to the fractiona- tion equation of Li et al.42based on the similarity of their precipitation conditions (1 M MgCl 2and 1 M CaCl 2).Given a dolomite precipitationtemperature on Ryugu of 37 ± 10 °C6,Δ25Mg dolomite-aq was calculated to be–0.83 ± 0.11 ‰.The Mg isotope ratios of the carbonates provide insight into the partitioning of the major constituent element Mg and precipitatingconditions.
The main factors controlling the isotope fractionation ofcarbonates are temperature and precipitation rate, and calibrations ofthese factors have been reported for each carbonate polymorph. However, in the case of inorganic carbonates precipitated from solu- tions with relatively high Mg/Ca ratios ( > ~3 mol/mol) and saturationindices ( Ω>~ 3 ;e .g ., Ω calcite =[ C a2+][ C O 32-]/Ksp,w h e r e Kspis the stoi- chiometric solubility product of calcite), the precipitation rate has noeffect on mass-dependent 25Mg/24Mg fractionation and the tempera- ture dependency is ~0.005 ‰/°C28.When the 2 σvalue of the external repeatability of δ25Mg is about ± 0.05 ‰36,δ25Mg may be a temperature indicator with an error of ~10 °C, if it follows an isotope equilibriumreaction.Among the carbonates, the fact that calcite precipitatedearlier suggests that dolomite, in contrast, formed during retrogradecooling when the ﬂuid and silicate approached oxygen isotopic equilibrium 16.
Because the breunnerite may have formed at a later stage of aqueous alteration than dolomite, it may be possible to useδ 25Mg to detect the difference in precipitation temperature. Precipitation order of Mg-bearing secondary minerals Theδ25Mg of the dolomite endmember was calculated to be –1.40‰to –1.33‰(Fig.4) from the linear relationship between δ25Mg and Mg/Ca of the bulk samples35and Mg/Ca of dolomite12,43(summarized in Sup- plementary Table S3).These values are 0.34 –0.41‰lower than the isotopic composition of dolomite, which is assumed to have pre-cipitated directly from ﬂuid containing Mg 2+supplied by primary sili- cate mineral dissolution at the very beginning of aqueous alteration (Fig.4).This difference in δ25Mg can be considered evidence of Mg uptake by secondary phyllosilicates prior to the precipitation of thedolomite.
In general, the preferential uptake of 25Mg rather than24Mg by phyllosilicates during their formation results in a δ25Mg decrease in the residual solution. In addition, the δ25Mg value of the exchangeableFig.7 | Model of Mg isotopic changes during aqueous alteration on Ryugu.In this model, the initial solution was set to zero Mg loss and Δ25Mgﬂuid=0‰,a n d dissolved Mg was assumed to be partitioned into two dominant Mg host phases, phyllosilicate and dolomite.This model accounts for two isotopic tie points:(1) the offset of δ 25Mg values between theoretical and Ryugu dolomite (Δ25Mg Ryugu-Theo =–0.38 ‰)35, shown in Fig.4,a n d( 2) the isotopic composition of dissolved Mg in the ﬁnal stage that liquid H 2O was present ( Δ25Mgﬂuid=–0.55‰ compared to the initial solution) estimated from the cation exchange pool ofphyllosilicates (Supplementary Table S4).
The former re ﬂects the timing of the dolomite precipitation event, and the latter re ﬂects the composition before the complete loss of liquid H 2O. The25Mg/24Mg fractionation factor αfor dolomite is from Li et al.42, and its formation at 37 ± 10 °C6was calculated.The αvalues for phyllosilicates were calculated by assuming isotopic fractionation in a closed system.The Mg contents in the residual ﬂuid is present at a 5% relative to dolomite(see Supplementary Information), with the Mg isotopic composition of –0.55‰ (this study).Model results based on elemental mass balance of Ryugu A0106 and C0107, for ( A) a Mg abundance ratio of 92.8:4.9:2.3 for phyllosilicates, dolomite and exchangeable fractions and ( B) for 96.3:2.5:1.2 (see Supplement Fig.S6 for sensi- tivity experiments).In the orange sections, Mg removal to dolomite and phyllosi-licate occurs simultaneously.
The Mg removal rate to dolomite was assumed to be one-third that of phyllosilicate in order to achieve conditions of low isotopic ratio heterogeneity in dolomite; cases with varying precipitation rates are shown inSupplementary Fig. S6.We used the following equation for closed-system fractio- nation: Δ 25Mgfluid=δ25Mg0+ 1000 ðα/C01ÞlnðfwÞwhere Δ25Mgﬂuidandδ25Mg 0are the Mg isotopic composition of the ﬂuid and its initial value (set at 0); αis the frac- tionation factor between the dissolved Mg and secondary minerals; and fwis the fraction of Mg remaining in the ﬂuid.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50814-y Nature Communications | (2024) 15:6809 7 pool indicates that the decrease of the isotopic composition from that of the initial bulk Ryugu is −0.55‰(see also the next section), which can be considered as the endpoint of Mg isotopic changes in aqueousalteration.
A model for the precipitation of phyllosilicates and dolomite in a closed system has been constructed with a Mg partitioning ratio of upto 90:10 for phyllosilicates and dolomite 35, the main Mg-host phases in Ryugu. Furthermore, the observed isotopic composition of dolomiteand exchangeable forms at Ryugu constrain the fractionation factorfor Mg structurally incorporated into phyllosilicates in a closed system.If an isotope fractionation factor of 0.99917 42is applied to Ryugu dolomite, a simple model for Mg partitioning during aqueous altera-tion on Ryugu indicates that the Mg 2+isﬁrst precipitated in phyllosi- licates with a25Mg/24Mg fractionation factor of 1.00027 (Fig.7A).The solution from which dolomite would precipitate afterward would have a composition corresponding to the observed –0.38 ‰decrease of δ25Mg (Fig.7A).
Secondary phyllosilicate precipitation continued after dolomite precipitation, and the ﬁnalδ25Mg composition of the solution was recorded in the cation exchange pool to have decreased further by–0.55‰compared to the δ 25Mg composition of the initial solution (Fig. 7A, Supplementary Table S4).This precipitation order is con- sistent with the chemical reaction modeling results for Ryugu4,w h i c h show that saponite precipitates over a lower W/R range, correspond-ing to low-alteration lithologies without dolomite.Thus, the δ 25Mg compositions allow quanti ﬁcation of the Mg partitioning history.When a Mg partition of 2.5% for dolomite is applied instead, dolomite precipitation occurs at a later stage of aqueous alteration, and the fractionation factor of phyllosilicate is calculated to be1.00020 (Fig.7B).Under both Mg partitioning conditions (Fig.
7A, B), removal of Mg 2+by phyllosilicate precedes the precipitation of dolo- mite, and the timing of dolomite precipitation is calculated to com-mence when the residual Mg 2+is approximately 76% to 87 % of the original budget. In the future, it will be necessary to determine bulkrepresentative values of Mg abundances of dolomite and phyllosilicateat Ryugu, and to comprehensively determine the crystallizationsequence during aqueous alteration based on oxygen and carbonisotope ratios of dolomite and age values.Oxygen and carbon isotope ratios of the Ryugu dolomite indicate that it was formed during ret- rograde cooling in the late stages of aqueous alteration 12,44.F r o mt h e viewpoint of Mg partitioning, it is also supported that dolomite pre-cipitation occurred at a time when partitioning was well advanced.
Partitioning of Mg2+in cation exchange pools and solute compositions In both A0106 and C0107, the most abundant alkali metals in the H 2O extracts were Na and K, together accounting for about 56% of the totalbudget; Mg was next with 36%, and Ca was the least abundant. Clayminerals have two metal reservoirs with different chemical behaviors and Mg isotopic ratios: exchangeable Mg and structurally bound Mg 29.The lowest δ25Mg value of the H 2O extracts was about –0.8‰in both this study and in the SOM leaching7; but in contrast, the δ25Mg value of the clay mineral fraction in the SOM leaching was –0.17‰and that in the residual fraction (HF/HClO 4extract) of the present study was –0.08 ‰.
The main Mg host in clay minerals and in the residual phyl- losilicate fractions is probably structural Mg, which has higher δ25Mg than the olivine average45.T h ei d e n t i ﬁcation of mineral phases at micro- to nanoscale also rules out the presence of secondary mineralscomposed of inorganic Mg salts 4. From the cation exchange pool of phyllosilicates (e.g., surface sites and exchangeable interlayer sites),isotopic tracers have shown that dissolved Mg is taken up without fractionation 29,32.T h e δ25Mg of the NH 4Cl fraction extracted after the H2O extraction is –0.64 ‰, which is 0.5 ‰lower than that of the clay fraction in the SOM leaching (i.e., HCl extracts, Fig.3).The exchangeable ions equilibrate to changes in solution compositionthrough rapid exchange reactions 31.Therefore, the solute compositionof the exchange pool should be close to the solute composition at the ﬁnal stage of aqueous alteration when liquid H 2O was still present on Ryugu.
Ionic composition of the ﬂuid in contact with cation exchange pools The H 2O extracts described above have a lower proportion of alkali metals than the hot H 2O extract in the SOM leaching, and it is the exchangeable fractions that explain this difference: in A0106 andC0107, 86% and 73%, respectively, of the exchangeable fraction con-sists of Na and K, re ﬂe c t i n gt h es e l e c t i v i t yo ft h ec a t i o ne x c h a n g ep o o l of saponite for alkali metals and the aqueous alteration solutioncomposition.
Cation exchange reactions of clay minerals are rever-sible, and the general ion selectivity for monovalent and divalentcations increases in the following order 46: Li+<N a+<K+<R b+<C s+within the alkaline metals group ð1AÞ, Mg2+<C a2+≤Sr2+≤Ba2+within the alkaline earth metals group ð2AÞ: Here, potassium and magnesium are known to have comparable ion selectivity when monovalent and divalent ions are compared46.A s is usual for strongly acidic ion exchangers, common clay minerals (e.g.,kaolinite and montmorillonite) show this selective adsorption of Na + before Li+, but saponite is more selective for Li+than Na+47: Na+<L i+<K+<R b+<C s+ Cation exchange is a rapid chemical reaction between the cations of the dissolved phase and the mineral surface (especially clay minerals), wherein a cation exchange pool is formed on the reactantsurface and the negative charge on the clay surface is balanced 31.
Because we eluted exchangeable cations separately, ﬁrst with H 2Oa n d then with NH 4Cl, rather than directly with NH 4Cl, the total cations extracted during these steps are merged. Because the elemental ratiosin this exchangeable pool were considered to be in exchange equili-brium with the ambient dissolved ions until the latest stage of aqueousalteration, the chemical composition of the ﬂuid was reconstructed from the partition coef ﬁcients of the cations.To reconstruct the dissolved ion composition, we applied parti- tion coef ﬁcients of K Na/Mg =0 .5 , KNa/Ca =0 .4 , a n d KNa/K= 0.2 between theﬂuid and cation exchange pool31and the average element ratios in the exchange pool.Owing to the presence of potential heterogeneityin the ﬂuid composition corresponding to differences in the degree of alteration and W/R, calculations were carried out using the averagedvalues for A0106 and C0107.
The Na/Mg, Na/K, and Na/Ca values of theRyugu exchange pool were calculated to be 0.97, 0.49, and 4.3,respectively. Given the above partition coef ﬁcients, the chemical composition of the cation exchange pool demonstrates that Na wasthe most abundant dissolved cation in the ﬂuid in contact with the cation exchange pool of the clay minerals with molar ratios of Na +to Mg2+,K+,a n dC a2+of 1.9, 2.5, and 10.7, respectively (Fig.6).The ratio of the Na concentration to the K concentration ranges from 1.3 to 2.1,when K Na/K values of 0.24 to 0.38 obtained from the laboratory experiments with saponite are applied47.Whether natural or experi- mental ideal substitution reactions re ﬂect actual substitution reactions should be investigated in the future (e.g., ionic composition, effects ofionic strength, and pH), but in both cases of natural and experimentalsubstitution reactions, the present result shows that Na was the mostabundant cation.
The evolution of the initial Mg-Na-Cl solution into areductive Na-Cl brine, as proposed by Nakamura et al. 4, supports that the ionic composition of the solution in contact with phyllosilicates during the ﬁnal stages of “liquid ”water –rock interaction at Ryugu was also Na-rich.Although direct evidence for the chemical composition ofArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50814-y Nature Communications | (2024) 15:6809 8 the solution is scarce, the cation exchange pools of extraterrestrial materials are a quantitative snapshot of water chemistry.This novelarchive can provide an accurate picture of the chemical interaction oftheﬂuid and coexisting prebiotic organic molecules on Ryugu because monovalent cations tend to act as bulk electrolytes that stabilize the surface charge of molecules (Fig.8).The results of the sequential leaching and analysis of carbonate grains in Ryugu samples can be summarized as follows: 1.
Sequential leaching revealed chemical and isotopic character- istics of each mineral with different solubility. The combination ofMg/Ca and Mg/Fe with Mg isotopic compositions ( δ 25Mg) describe the mixing and precipitation behavior of each mineralcomponent.Generally, the more soluble mineral phases werefound to be characterized as enriched in light Mg isotopes.2.δ 25Mg of the breunnerite grain precipitated during aqueous alteration of the Ryugu parent body and observed mass- dependent isotope fractionation associated with carbonateprecipitation succeeded in constraining the δ 25Mg endmember of secondary minerals more accurately than the sequentialleaching of Ryugu aggregates.Evidence of mass-dependent 25Mg/24Mg fractionation of carbonates means that this indicator is a useful new tool for investigating carbonate neoformation,solute feeding mode, dissolution, and reprecipitation e.g.48.
Carbonates and phyllosilicates are ubiquitous minerals incarbonaceous chondrites, and assuming a fractionation factorof dolomite of 0.99917, the isotope fractionation factors forphyllosilicates during the aqueous alteration of Ryugu can be constrained to 1.00027 (for a partition ratio of phyllosilicates, carbonates and exchangeable Mg of 92.8:4.9:2.3) and 1.00020(for a ratio of 96.3:2.5:1.2). The Mg isotopic ratios of thecarbonates indicate that the precipitation of phyllosilicatesoccurred ﬁrst, followed by dolomite precipitation.Somephyllosilicate precipitation continued, however, after the dolo- mite precipitation.3.The sequential chemical leaching results revealed the composition of cations of different solubili ty phases and enabled the aqueous alteration history of Ryugu to be reconstructed.
The ionic com- position of the cation exchange pool showed that a Na-rich ﬂuid was present at the time of the last contact with an aqueous phase.Because of the limited sample size, only tens to hundreds ofnanograms of Mg were available in several of the fractions in thisstudy, but the analytical uncertainty could be further reduced bymore accurate analysis of large carbonate samples 35,38–41.S u c h analysis would lead to a more accurate understanding of the endcomponents and improved accuracy of temperature estimates. The historic and successful sample returned to the Earth from the asteroid (101955) Bennu on 24 September 2023, the OSIRIS-REx (Ori- gins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identi ﬁcation, Security, Rego- lith Explorer) sample opportunity was on the schedule 49.The sample was safely and successfully recovered to process the laboratory-basedanalysis 50.
Interestingly, onsite investigations of Bennu have detected large “whitish ”veins potentially associated with carbonate assem- blages, which are thought to have been formed by aqueous alteration51. For further understanding of primordial aqueous chemistry25,52,t h e chemical leaching approach of the present study (and the SOMleaching study) is expected to elucidate differences in the partitioningof primordial soluble ions during the aqueous and/or thermal historyof this carbonaceous asteroid.Methods Breunnerite grain sample and laser Raman micro-spectroscopy The largest single grain of breunnerite was physically isolated from theRyugu C0002 sample obtained from the second touchdown location 1 2:1 mineral Na+ Na+Mg2+Salting-in effects Salting-out K+> Na+> H+> Ca2+> Mg2+ Contact zone Hydrophobic interaction Aqueous zone-O O- OSSO- OSSH3N+OO-NH3 +*O-OCn H3N+N HNH O- O-O O-O O Na+Na+Tetrahedral or Octahedral charge Electrostatic bondHydrated cation N Fig.
8 | Conceptual model to illustrate cation-organic-mineral interactions. At the clay mineral surface contact zone, cations and amphiphilic fragments accu- mulate on the charged surface through electrostatic interactions, with the hydro- phobic part directed toward the outer side of the polar aqueous solution.In thediscontinuous hydrophobic interaction zone, the hydrophobic parts of organic molecules (e.g., alkylpyridines, shown above) and carbon chains of amphiphilic molecules (e.g., hydroxy alkylthiosulfonic acids) are shielded from the polar aqu-eous phase (molecular assignment by Naraoka et al.; Parker et al.; Yoshimura et al.;Oba et al.5,7,20,22.In the aqueous solution zone, various organic substances and cations and anions are highly mobile.The main dissolved cation is Na, as con ﬁrmed by the ionic composition of the cation exchange pool of the clay minerals (this study), the chemical extraction of the salt fraction7, and the chemical reaction modeling of aqueous alteration4.
The trends of cation salting-in and -out effects, known as the Hofmeister series, are also shown. This scheme is modi ﬁed after Kleber et al.67.It is not intended to represent all of the organic and mineral surface types involved in the actual reactions of the aqueous alteration of asteroid Ryugu.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50814-y Nature Communications | (2024) 15:6809 9 (Fig.1).Ryugu C0002 is a large pebble sample and its elemental composition has been reported in detail4,6,53.W ei d e n t i ﬁed the carbo- nate grain ( ~ 300 μm) by using non-destructive laser Raman micro- spectroscopy54prior to wet-chemical treatment.Raman measurements were performed on the C0002 carbonate grains (Fig.2) and on carbonate reference standards by a Raman-11i microscope (Nanophoton Corp., Japan) in combination with an EclipseTi (Nikon Corp., Japan) microscope 54.
A Nikon Plan Fluor (40x, NA 0.75, WD 0.66) objective lens was used to focus the laser onto the sample,and the backscattered light was collected by the same objective lens.The excitation wavelength was 532 nm, and the power was 10 mW atthe sample plane. Spectra were measured with 120-s exposures anda v e r a g e dt w i c e .T h es l i tw i d t ha tt h ee n t r a n c eo ft h es p e c t r o m e t e rw a s50µm, and a grating of 1200 grooves/mm was used.Under these measurement conditions, spectra from approximately –30 to +1270 cm –1were recorded every 1.1 cm–1.Peak frequencies were determined to an accuracy of approximately 0.1 cm–1byﬁtting each peak with a Lorentz function after baseline correction.The repeat-ability of the peak frequency was generally smaller than 2 cm –1.T h e baseline was de ﬁned as a linear function connecting spectral points ±50 cm–1from the apparent peak frequency.
Two carbonate grains from C0002 were identi ﬁed by comparison with the reference stan- dard spectra of calcite, magnesite, siderite, rhodochrosite, and dolo-mite measured together with C0002 grains, and also by comparisonwith the reference peak frequencies of breunnerite, ankerite, andkutnohorite 54. Aggregate samples and sequential leaching Ryugu aggregate samples were collected at the ﬁrst (A0106) and sec- ond (C0107) touchdown sites on the asteroid Ryugu5,7,20;c f .a s s e s s i n g for dissolved organic matter25.The latter sample, C0107, potentially contained subsurface materials55,56from the arti ﬁcially made impact crater (Fig.1).Data on the production rates of surface-irradiated nuclides indicate that exposure conditions and depths differedbetween the chambers 56, suggesting that the sample from chamber A had an exposure age of approximately 4 million years, whereas thesample from chamber C was estimated to have been ejected from the lower part of a 1.7-m arti ﬁcial crater 55.
The sample weights used for the sequential chemical leaching were 0.16 mg for A0106 and 0.42 mg forC0107 (Supplementary Fig. S1).Sequential leaching was performed onthese samples using 500 μL of each solvent in the order H 2O, 1.0 M NH 4Cl (adjusted to pH = 8.0), 0.25 M Na 2EDTA (referred to as EDTA, pH = 6.5), 1.0 M CH 3COOH, and concentrated HF and HClO 4in a 1:1 mixture.Samples were weighed into nitric acid-washed PFA centrifugetubes.Then each extraction solution was added, followed by a 40 kHzultrasonic bath for 5 min; the reaction was carried out for 2 h on ashaking table.All reactions were carried out at room temperature.
Ineach extraction step, the supernatant was collected after centrifuga- tion for 5 min, and the residue was dissolved in HF/HClO 457.N o t et h a t the precipitation order during aqueous alteration is opposite to theextraction order, because precipitates are removed into the solidphase in order of decreasing solubility, whereas in each chemicalleaching step, the reactivity and acidity of the reagents increases sothat components with higher solubility are extracted before those withlower solubility. SOM in the Ryugu samples was previously subjected to sequential extraction 5,7.The samples were reacted with N 2gas-purged ultrapure water (Tamapure AA100, Tama Chemical Co., Ltd.Japan) in ﬂame- sealed ampoules that were also purged with N 2gas in the headspace at 105 °C for 20 hours.
Next, the sample was reacted with a mixture of dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol (MeOH) in a 1:1 volume ratio (DCM/MeOH, #8) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by >99%HCOOH (#9) overnight at room temperature. Finally, the sample wasreacted with 20% HCl (#10) for 15 min at room temperature to com-plete the extraction of soluble material.The supernatant ﬂuid in eachfraction was collected by centrifugation.For comparison, Tarda (C2 ung), Aguas Zarcas (CM2), and Jbilet Winselwan (CM2) (Table 1)w e r e also subjected to similar extraction experiments by Yoshimura et al.7 (Supplementary Table S5).Only the HCOOH and HCl extracts of these meteorites were used for analysis because the others were used pre- ferentially for the analysis of SOM.The SOM leaching results for Ryuguand these meteorites are also presented in Table 2.In addition, δ 25Mg of the hot H 2O extract in the SOM leaching was also measured in this study.The present study and the SOM leaching study differed as fol- lows.
Leaching was carried out in this study under more mild con-ditions and with the intention to subdivide the fractions extracted byhot H 2O (#7-1) and HCOOH (#9). The ﬁrst H 2O leaching step in the present study was carried out at room temperature, whereas theSOM leaching was conducted at high temperature under anaerobic conditions.Second, only in this study was NH 4Cl used for extracting exchangeable ions, mainly from clay minerals (phyllosilicates), whereadsorbed ions are recovered in the aqueous phase when they arereplaced at the exchangeable sites with NH 4+ions, for which they show a high preference.The prepared NH 4Cl solution was slightly alkaline, with the aim of preventing the dissolution of carbonates.Inthe SOM leaching, carbonates were extracted with formic acid 7, which dissolves dolomite almost completely but also dissolves a partof Mg-bearing phyllosilicates.In contrast, EDTA selectively dissolvesonly carbonates.
Acetic acid (CH 3COOH), which is similar to formic acid (HCOOH), can recover residual carbonates. Note that EDTA mostly does not react with clay minerals, whereas CH 3COOH may dissolve ~10% of saponite, a very soluble clay mineral (SupplementaryTable S1).The SOM leaching dissolved phyllosilicates with hydro-chloric acid, but silicates such as olivine were not completely dis-solved.In contrast, HF/HClO 4completely dissolved the residual, including silicates.Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry Trace-element concentrations were measured by quadrupole induc-tively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, iCAP Qc, ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc Inc., MA, USA).A 0.3 M HNO 3solution was added to each vial to dilute the samples.The HNO 3used in this study was a commercially supplied high-purity reagent (TAMAPURE AA-100, TamaChemical, Co., Ltd.Japan).We added internal standards (Be, Sc, Y, andIn) to the HNO 3to correct for instrumental drift.
Mass interferences were eliminated by using the kinetic energy discrimination mode withH 2for Fe analysis and He gas for the other elements. For the Mg isotope analysis, each extract was dried down on a heater and then re-dissolved in 8 mM HNO 3.Samples were puri ﬁed in an IC Metrohm 930 Compact IC Flex system coupled to an Agilent1260 In ﬁnity II Bio-Inert analytical-scale fraction collector system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) set in a class-1000 clean hood 58,59.For complete separation of cations, the samples were eluted through a Metrohm Metrosep C6-250/4.0 column with 8 mM ultrapureHNO 3at aﬂow rate of 0.9 mL·min−1.Magnesium isotope ratios were measured by a multiple collector (MC) ICP-MS Neptune plus (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc Inc., MA, USA) at the Geological Survey of Japan, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.Weperformed Mg isotope analysis with a nickel sampler cone and a high-sensitivity X-skimmer cone.
Sample solutions were introduced with aPFA nebulizer (MicroFlow, ~50 µL·min −1, ESI, Omaha, USA) attached to a quartz dual-cyclonic spray chamber in free aspiration mode. The beamintensity for the 100 ppb (parts per billion) solutions was approxi-mately 5.0 V for 24Mg.After initial uptake of the solutions, a single analysis consisted of 40 cycles with an integration time of 4 s per cycle.The background signal intensities were measured with a 0.3 M ultra-pure HNO 3solution for 1 cycle with an integration time of 30 s per cycle.The 2 SD values of each data point were calculated from tripli-cate measurements of each sample.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50814-y Nature Communications | (2024) 15:6809 10 T h ei s o t o p i cd a t aa r ee x p r e s s e da sp e rm i l( ‰) deviations relative to the DSM-3 standard.
The Mg isotope ratio was de ﬁned as follows: δ25Mg =25Mg =24Mg/C0/C1 sample=25Mg =24Mg/C0/C1 DSM /C03/C01hi × 1000 ð2Þ Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents and their isotopic compositions For assessing the carbonate-bearing potential, we compiled the ele- mental abundance of carbon (C, wt%) and nitrogen (N, wt%) and theδ 13C(‰vs. VPDB) and δ15N(‰vs.Air) isotopic compositions (Table 1).For the total C and N contents with their isotopic compositions ( δ13C, δ15N), we used an ultrasensitive nano-EA/IRMS method (Flash EA1112 elemental analyzer/Con ﬂo III interface/Delta Plus XP isotope-ratio mass spectrometer, Thermo Finnigan Co., Bremen)e.g.5,20,60.I nT a b l e 1, data of the Ryugu aggregate samples (A0106, C0107) and of reference carbonaceous meteorites are presented.
The C and N isotopic com-positions ( δvalues) are denoted in relation to international isotope standards as follows: δ 13C=13C=12C/C0/C1 sample=13C=12C/C0/C1 VPDB/C01hi ×1 0 0 0 ð3Þ using the Vienna Peedee Belemnite (VPDB) standard. δ15N=15N=14N/C0/C1 sample=15N=14N/C0/C1 Air/C01hi ×1 0 0 0 ð4Þ using the Earth atmospheric nitrogen (Air) standard.Data availability The Hayabusa2 project is releasing raw data on the properties of the asteroid Ryugu from the Hayabusa2 Science Data Archives (DARTS,https://www.darts.isas.jaxa.jp/planet/project/hayabusa2/ ) for Optical Navigation Camera (ONC), Thermal InfraRed Imager (TIR), NearInfraRed Spectrometer (NIR), LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR),SPICE kernels, and PDS4.We declare that all these database publica-tions are compliant with ISAS data policies ( https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/ en/researchers/data-policy/ ).The data generated in this study are provided in the Supplementary Information/Source Data ﬁle.References 1.Tachibana, S.et al.
