However, protracted use of hyper- oxia leads to signiﬁcant morbidity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects ofvitamin B-6 supplementation on oxidative stress and inﬂammatory responses in neonatalrats undergoing hyperoxia therapy.The study consisted of 2 parts: a survival study and avitamin B-6 efﬁcacy study for 16 days.Neonatal rats were randomly divided into either thecontrol group, B-6 group (subcutaneously injected with 90 mg/kg/d of pyridoxal 5 0-phos- phate [PLP]), O 2group (treated with 85% oxygen), or O 2þB-6 group (simultaneously treated with 85% oxygen and 90 mg/kg/d PLP).After the survival study was done, the vitamin B-6efﬁcacy study was performed with duplicate neonatal rats sacriﬁced on the 3rd, 6th, 9th,and 16th day.Serum inﬂammatory cytokines, tissue pathology, and malondialdehyde(MDA) levels were measured.
In the survival study, the survival rate of neonatal rats in the control, B-6, O 2, and O 2þB-6 group on the 16th day were 100%, 100%, 25%, and 62.50%, respectively. The efﬁcacy study showed lung polymorphonuclear granulocyte (PMN) andmacrophage inﬁltration, increased liver hemopoiesis, and higher MDA levels in liver ho-mogenates at days 3 through 16 in the O 2group.Vitamin B-6 supplementation considerably increased serum inﬂammatory cytokines in either the 6th or 9th day and decreased liverMDA level before the 6th day.These results indicate that neonatal rats receiving hyperoxiatreatment suffered divergent serum inﬂammatory responses and were in increased liver *Corresponding author .Department of Nutrition, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.Fax: +886 4 23248175.E-mail address: clhsu@csmu.edu.tw (C.-L.Hsu).

Hyperoxia is deﬁned as an excess of oxygenin tissues and organs (fraction of inspired oxygen >60%), which can lead to the development of chronic lung disease [1,2], retinopathy, and brain injury in neonates [3,4]. A fetus develops in the uterus, which is a relatively hypoxic envi-ronment, and fetal antioxidant capabilities, such as the su-peroxide dismutase and glutathione antioxidant systems, areimmature [5,6].After birth, some neonates are exposed to hyperoxic conditions, which can increase levels of reactiveoxygen species (ROS).This can in turn induce cellular damagethrough local activation of proinﬂammatory signaling and therecruitment of inﬂammatory cells into the vital organs,thereby resulting in uncontrolled tissue injury [7,8].Accordingly, antioxidative therapy might prevent neonates from hyperoxia-induced complications.
Many vitamins withantioxidative actions, such as vitamin A, C, and E, have beenevaluated in neonates to prevent hyperoxia-induced injury,but the results have been inconclusive [9e11]. Vitamin B-6 (15e30 mg/kg/d) has been used as an effective agent in the treatment of pyridoxine-dependent seizure in neonates since1954 [12,13] .In recent decades, vitamin B-6 has been shown to have a crucial role in antioxidant mechanism and inﬂamma-tory responses [14e18].Vitamin B-6 is not only readily avail- able in clinical settings but also a water-soluble vitamin,which might be safer than lipid soluble vitamins (e.g., vitamin A or E) as therapy for neonates.Vitamin B-6 is a collective term for the metabolically and functionally related pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxal,as well as their phosphorylated forms, pyridoxine 5 0-phos- phate, pyridoxamine 50-phosphate and pyridoxal 50-phos- phate (PLP).Pyridoxal 50-phosphate is the physiologically active coenzyme form of vitamin B-6.
Although the exactmechanism has not been fully ascertained, PLP may react withperoxy radicals and thereby scavenge free radicals and inhibitlipid peroxidation through its hydroxyl and amine group onthe pyridine ring [14e16,19] . In addition, PLP acts as a coen- zyme in the production of cytokines and other polypeptide mediators during inﬂammatory response [17].Inadequate vitamin B-6, therefore, might directly decrease its antioxidantcapacities or compromise inﬂammatory responses [20,21] .If neonates are under increased oxidative stress and in- ﬂammatory response during hyperoxia therapy [22,23] , this could exhaust the use and metabolic turnover of plasma PLPand decrease tissue PLP reserves [24,25] .Therefore, it might be useful to determine whether vitamin B-6 supplementationwould have a preventive effect in reducing oxidative stress orinﬂammatory responses while neonates are receiving hyper- oxia therapy.
In this study, we imitated clinical conditions by using neonatal rats in a hyperoxic environment. We then evaluated whether vitamin B-6 supplementation had an effecton oxidative stress, inﬂammatory response, and survival inneonatal rats with hyperoxia therapy.2.Methods 2.1.Animals and study design The ﬁrst part of this study was a survival study and the secondpart of this study was a vitamin B-6 efﬁcacy study.In thesurvival study, four pregnant Wistar rats were obtained fromBioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd.and were raised in the animalcenter of Changhua Christian Hospital for 1 week before de-livery.Sufﬁcient water and normal diet were freely providedto the maternal rats, which were kept in a 12:12-h light edark cycle.
After delivery within 12 h, neonatal rats were randomlydivided into four groups: 1) control group, neonatal rats weretreated with room air and daily normal saline injections(equivalent volume of PLP); 2) hyperoxia group (O 2group), neonatal rats were housed in a chamber (air jacket multi-gas incubator, Astec Co., Ltd.) and treated with 85% O 2and daily normal saline injections; 3) vitamin B-6 group (B-6 group),neonatal rats were subcutaneously injected with PLP (90 mg/kg/d); 4) hyperoxia combined with vitamin B-6 group (O 2þB-6 group), neonatal rats simultaneously treated with 85% O 2and daily subcutaneous PLP (90 mg/kg/d) injections. All neonatalrats were fed by maternal rats during the experimental period.Maternal rats were rotated daily between the O 2-exposed rats and room air-exposed rats to avoid O 2toxicity and to elimi- nate maternal effects among groups.Body weight and mor- tality of neonatal rats were monitored daily for 16 days.
The second part of this study was a vitamin B-6 efﬁcacy study. In the ﬁrst run of the efﬁcacy study, we repeated thesurvival study design for 16 days, and neonatal rats of eachgroup were sacriﬁced on the 16th day.Phenobarbital wasinjected intraperitoneally before the rats were sacriﬁced.Inthe second run of the efﬁcacy study, another 6 pregnantWistar rats were obtained and raised in the animal center ofChanghua Christian Hospital for 1 week before delivery.Within 12 h after delivery, neonatal rats were randomlydivided into 4 groups, as in the survival study.Four fertile maternal rats were selected and rotated daily between the oxygen and room air-exposed neonatal rats.On the 3rd, 6th,and 9th day, neonatal rats of each group were sacriﬁced.Neonatal rats with poor activity in each group were sacriﬁcedin priority in order to keep the experimental numbers in eachjournal of food and drug analysis 26 (2018) 1086 e1096 1087 group even.Blood and tissue samples were collected after anesthesia.
Blood samples were drawn from the heart, transported on ice, and separated into plasma and red bloodcells within 30 min through low-speed centrifugation(3000 rpm, 15 min, 4 /C14C). Tissues were immediately homoge- nized in phosphate-buffered saline.The homogenized solu-tion was then centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 4 /C14C, 10 min).The supernatant was then carefully removed for analysis.Allsamples were stored frozen ( /C020 /C14C) until analysis.All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the rules of the Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittee (IACUC) of Changhua Christian Hospital, Chan- ghua, Taiwan (IACUC Approval No.CCH-AE-103-010).2.2.Administration and dosage selection of PLP Pyridoxal 50-phosphate was purchased from Shinlin Sinseng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.(Taoyuan, Taiwan).The concentra-tion of PLP solution was 10 mg/mL.A human equivalent dosecalculation method was based on body surface area for doseselection.
Because 15 mg/kg/day of PLP injection has been determined to be safe in the treatment of pyridoxine- dependent seizure in human, we then estimated that 90 mg/kg/day was appropriate for neonatal rats [13,26] . Additionally, because research has indicated that the lethal dose of pyri-doxine aspartate given via the subcutaneous route for rats isapproximately 3000 mg/kg, the choice of dosage in the presentstudy was thought to be reasonable [27,28] .2.3.Measurement of oxidative stress and inﬂammatory response Oxidative stress was estimated as levels of malondialdehyde (MDA).Lung and liver MDA was measured in terms of thio-barbituric acid reactive substances based on the methoddescribed by Lapenna et al.[29].
Plasma inﬂammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor- a(TNF- a), interleukin 1 b(IL-1 b), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin 17 a(IL-17 a), macrophage inﬂammatory protein 3 a (MIP-3 a), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected using the Bio-Plex Immunoassay Multiplex System (Suu-Flower CO., Ltd. [Taichung, Taiwan]).This system uses different detect-able bead sets as substrate capturing analytes in solution andemploys ﬂuorescent methods for detection.In addition toplasma cytokine levels, we used western blot technique toquantity IL-6 protein levels in lung and liver homogenates todetect tissue inﬂammatory cytokine levels.2.4.Pathology of lung and liver tissues After the right main bronchus was ligated, right middle lungtissue was removed from each neonatal rat for the pathologicexamination.The remaining tissue was left for the prepara-tion of lung homogenate.
The liver tissue was cut into twoblocks for the pathological examination and tissue homoge-nates. Pathological samples were put into 4% para-formaldehyde (Sigma Chemical Co., Saint Louis, MO, USA) inroom temperature for 2 weeks.They were then embedded inparafﬁn, cut, and stained through the hematoxylin and eosinmethod.We observed pathological changes of the liver and lung by using a Nikon 80i research microscope.The number of lung polymorphonuclear granulocyte (PMN), macrophage,and liver hemopoietic foci were assessed in ﬁve nonoverlap-ping ﬁelds at a /C2400 magniﬁcation for each animal.2.5.Statistical analyses Data were analyzed using the SAS statistical software (version 9.3; The SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).Differences of weight, cytokine, and oxidative stress levels among groups were determined through one-way analysis of variance onranks, and Tukey test was used for the post hoc analysis.
The Kaplan eMeier method was used to evaluate the survival of neonatal rats, and the log-rank test was used to compare thesurvival differences among groups. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess the effect of different treatments on oxidative stress indicator orcytokine levels.The treatment was set as the independentvariable and oxidative stress indicator or cytokine levels wereset as the dependent variable after adjusting for the study period.All data were presented as means ±standard error.Statistical signiﬁcance was set as p<0.05.3.Results 3.1.Effect of vitamin B-6 on survival rate in neonatal rats exposed to hyperoxia In the survival study, 47 neonatal rats (27 males and 20 females) were born from 4 maternal rats.In our earlier experiments, thesurvival rate was 20% in neonatal rats exposed to hyperoxia for14 days.
For the poor survival rate and to further conﬁrm theeffect of B-6 on the survival, we doubled the experimentalnumbers in the O 2and O 2þB-6 group in this part of study. Neonatal rats were randomly divided into either the controlgroup (n ¼7, 3 males, 4 females), B-6 group (n ¼8, 4 males, 4 females), O 2group (n ¼16, 10 males, 6 females), and O 2þB-6 group (n ¼16, 10 males, 6 females).Mean weight changes of neonatal rats in different treatment groups from birth to day 16 are shown in Table 1 .There was no signiﬁcant weight differ- ence among groups on day 0.Although mean weight ofneonatal rats gradually increased during the study period,mean weight gain of neonatal rats in the O 2and O 2þB-6 groups slowed after day 2 compared with control and B-6 groups.Plasma PLP was only measured in 3 neonatal rats in each groupdue to the blood volume was limited.
Plasma PLP concentrationwas 462.09 ±72.99, 909.57 ±521.23, 1003.27 ±645.60, and 9957.06 ±15,864.57 in control, B-6, O 2,a n dO 2þB-6 groups, respectively (plasma PLP concentration signiﬁcantly increasedin vitamin B-6 supplemented groups, p<0.01). Fig.1 illustrates the survival curve of the four groups.No neonatal rats died during the study period in the control and B-6 groups.However, neonatal rats started to die at day 7 inthe O 2group, and only 4 neonatal rats in this group survived at the end of study period (day 16).By contrast, while 1 neonatalrat died at the day 8, 11 neonatal rats survived at the end of thestudy in the O 2þB-6 group.Log rank test showed O 2group had statistically low survival rate compare to control ( p¼0.01), B-6journal of food and drug analysis 26 (2018) 1086 e1096 1088 (p<0.01), and O 2þB-6 ( p¼0.04) groups, while survival rate in O2þB-6 group had no difference when compared with either control or B-6 groups.
We duplicated the design of the survival study in the ﬁrst run of the efﬁcacy study. A total 52 neonatal rats (29 males and23 females) were born from 4 maternal rats.Neonatal ratswere randomly divided into four groups: the control group(n¼10, 5 males, 5 females), B-6 group (n ¼10, 6 males, 4 fe- males), O 2group (n ¼16, 9 males, 7 females), and O 2þB-6 group (n ¼16, 9 males, 7 females).Four female neonatal rats died in the O 2group during this part of the study.During the 2nd run of the efﬁcacy study, 77 neonatal rates were born from 6 maternal rats.A total 60 neonatal rats were selected and randomly assigned to the control group (n ¼15); B-6 group (n ¼15); O 2group (n ¼15); and O 2þB-6 group (n¼15), with 7 males and 8 females in each group.Four of 6 maternal rats were selected and rotated daily between the O 2 and room air-exposed neonatal rats.
On the 3rd and 6th day, 2male and 3 female neonatal rats were sacriﬁced in each group.On the 9th day, 3 male and 2 female neonatal rats were sacriﬁced in each group. No neonatal rats died during the 2nd run of the efﬁcacy study.Table 2 lists body weight and adjusted tissue weight of the four groups in the efﬁcacy study.Similar to what was observed in the survival study, the in-crease of body weight was much slower in both O 2and O 2þB- 6 groups compared with control and B-6 groups.The O 2þB-6 group had the lowest body weight of the four experimentalgroups on day 16.Likewise, the lung-to-body weight ratiodecreased on 6th day but conversely increased on days 9 and16.The PLP treatment had no effect on liver weight but tendedto decrease lung-to-body weight ratio on day 16.3.2.
Vitamin B-6 supplement had inﬂuence on serum inﬂammatory cytokine The levels of inﬂammatory markers are shown in Table 3 .I n addition to IL-17 a, different cytokine levels were substantially lower at day 16 than at day 3 in each group.

Fig. 1 eKaplan eMeier curve of survival of four experimental groups for efﬁcacy study.journal of food and drug analysis 26 (2018) 1086 e1096 1089 different treatment groups, neonatal rats under hyperoxia exposure (O 2group) had divergent performance on IL-1 b, IL-6, IL-17 a, TNF- a, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), MIP-3 a, and VEGF levels.As an example, hyperoxia elevated MIP-3 aon day 9 but inversely decreased it on day 16.Also, IL-6 was elevated in the O 2and O 2þB-6 groups on day 9 but was undetectable in all groups on day 16.Additionally, TNF- aand M-CSF in the O 2group also had lower values than in the control group on day 16.After PLP supplementation, IL-1 b increased from day 3 to day 9 and MCP-1 increased on the 6th day.In comparison with the O 2group, supplemental PLP in hyperoxia helped maintain serum inﬂammatory cytokinelevels close to those of the control group on day 16.3.3.
Vitamin B-6 decreased hepatic oxidative stress under hyperoxia Table 4 displays oxidative stress indicator and IL-6 levels in liver and lung tissues of different treatment groups. Exposure to a hyperoxic environment increased oxidative stress (i.e., MDA level) in liver tissue during days 3 e16 day and on day 3 in lung tissue compared with the control groups.However, liver andlung MDA levels tended to decrease with time within the groupeven under high oxygen conditions in the hyperoxia group.Incontrast to oxidative stress status in the liver and lung, hyper-oxia temporally lowered IL-6 in liver homogenate on day 9 buthad no effect on lung IL-6 in our work.Injection of PLP protectedthe liver from oxidative stress on the 3rd day to the 6th day.3.4.Pathologic change after hyperoxia exposure and vitamin B-6 supplement The pathological changes of the liver and lung in different treatment groups are shown in Table 5 and Figs.2 and 3 .
Thesize of alveolar sac, level of PMNs and macrophage inﬁltration in lung tissue was considerably larger and increased in bothO 2and O 2þB-6 groups compared with control groups. PMNs peaked on the 3rd day and macrophages peaked on the 9thday.The levels of liver hemopoiesis were signiﬁcantly higherat the 3rd day than at the 6th, 9th, and 16th days in each group.Hyperoxia exposure was found to prolong the duration of liverhemopoiesis up to 16 days.Supplemental PLP did not changePMNs and macrophage inﬁltration in the lung, but it increasedthe duration of liver hemopoiesis up to 6 days.3.5.Inﬂuence of vitamin B-6 supplement on early oxidative stress and cytokine levels Multiple linear regression was done to assess the effect of different treatments on oxidative stress indicator and cyto-kine levels after adjusting for the study period before 9 days(Table 6 ).
Using the control group set as the reference group, hyperoxia (O 2group and O 2þB-6 group) had substantial ef- fects on liver MDA, serum TNF- a, lung PMN, and macrophage levels. Vitamin B-6 supplement was correlated with increasedserum IL-1 b.Hyperoxia combined with vitamin B-6 treat- ments (O 2þB-6 group) increased serum IL-17 aand VEGF values.4.Discussion Hyperoxia-induced complications and molecular changeshave been widely discussed [1e4].However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to evaluate whethervitamin B-6 supplementation had beneﬁcial effects onhyperoxia-induced oxidative stress and inﬂammatoryresponse in neonatal rats.Consistent with previous studies,Table 2 eWeight changes and adjusted tissue weight of neonatal rats in different treatment groups during the efﬁcacy study period.

Wefurther found that hyperoxi a exposure induced organ oxidative stress and had variable effects on serum inﬂam-matory cytokine levels (ﬁrst increased and then decreased).Daily injection of 90 mg/kg PLP could protect againstincreased oxidative stress, balance decreased serum in-ﬂammatory responses, and improve survival outcomes inneonatal rats receiving hyperoxia therapy. In the clinical setting, newborn babies received hyperoxia treatment because of a variety of diseases.High oxygenexposure itself may not directly lead to mortality in newbornsbut may cause complications.However, in the animal study,the mortality rate of neonatal rats during 16 days of hyperoxiatreatment was 75% in our survival study.A previous studyexamined oxygen-induced injury and found mortality rates of roughly 40% after 4 weeks in neonatal rats and 57% after 2weeks in neonatal mice [30,31] .
The injection of PLP seemed to have a protective effect and reduced the mortality rate(43.75%) during the 16 days of hyperoxia treatment. Althoughthe reasons for this protective effect are not fully understood,vitamin B-6 might play a key role in antioxidant and inﬂam-matory mechanisms.The animal model used in the present study was based on the Northway protocol, which is a typical research model for neonatal chronic lung disease [8].Compatible with previous ﬁndings, lung PMNs of neonatal rats increased earlier thanmacrophages, and the lung progressed to ﬁbrotic change witha decreased number of alveoli and enlarged terminal airwaysafter hyperoxia exposure [31].Similar to the ﬁndings of Marconi et al., our pathology results also showed the timeTable 3 eSerum cytokine measurements of neonatal rats in different treatment groups.

As such, several mechanisms, including evaluatinghemompoietic stem cell activation, must be studied. Hyperoxia exposure might induce hyperpermeability of pulmonary microvasculature and plasma extravasationsleading to pulmonary edema [34].This might explain why weobserved that hyperoxia affected lung development and the relatively small of lung-to-body weight ratios early in hyper-oxia therapy but increased lung-to-body weight ratios on the16th day.In the study conducted by Dionysis et al., miceexposed to 100% oxygen for 14 days also had smaller but heavier lungs than did those lungs exposed to normal room air.Studies have also shown that PLP had an effect on diuresis[35].Because there were no pathologic differences between the O 2and O 2þB-6 groups, the relatively low lung-to-body weight ratio in the O 2þB-6 group on day 16 might be due to this diuretic effect.
Diuresis may alleviate lung edema causedTable 4 eOxidative stress indicator and interleukin-6 level of neonatal rats in tissues in different treatment groups.

In our study, weobserved a transient increase of lung MDA in both O 2and O2þB-6 groups on the 3rd day, which normalized thereafter. Similar to our ﬁndings, Nagato et al.evaluated the time courseof oxidative damage in mouse lung homogenates, where they found that lung MDA levels were elevated soon after hyper-oxia exposure but normalized after 48 h.Management of ROSoverproduction requires a good balance between pro-oxidantand antioxidant systems.Vitamin B-6 has been demonstratedto have strong antioxidant effects [14e16,36] .In the liver, the injection of PLP protected the liver from oxidative stress on the 3rd day to the 6th day.However, the antioxidant effect ofvitamin B-6 did not persist to the 9th and 16th day in thisstudy.Because vitamin B-6 was metabolized in the liver,whether the adverse effect on oxidative stress was due tooverdose of PLP might be a possibility.The optimal dose and Fig.2 eLiver pathology among different treatment groups at 3, 6, 9 and 16 days.Fig.

Previous evidence has shown that high oxygen exposure upregulated proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 b, TNF- a, and IL-6, in bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid (BALF) [37].Rather than the examination of BALF, we checked serum cytokinelevels and found hyperoxia exposure also elevated serum MIP-3atransiently on the 9th day and tended to increase TNF- aon the 6th day.However, these two cytokine levels in the O 2 group substantially dropped on the 16th day to levels thatwere even lower than those of the control and B-6 groups.Inaddition to these two cytokines, all measured serum cytokinesin the O 2group on day 16 had the lowest levels of the four experimental groups.
Consistent with our ﬁndings, previous studies proposed that hyperoxia exposure initially increasesthe status of systemic inﬂammatory responses before causingthem to fall later [38e40]. Inﬂammation is a type of host de- fense.To maintain a certain degree of serum inﬂammatorycytokine levels while facing stress (i.e., a hyperoxic environ-ment) might be required to increase the survival rate.VitaminB-6 is involved in the synthesis of nucleic acid, mRNA andprotein, it is also associated with differentiation and matu-ration of monocyte-derived macrophages and T lymphocytes[41].
Since T lymphocytes and macrophages are major sources of many cytokines, vitamin B-6 supplementation under hyperoxia environment might help neonatal rats to maintaina slightly increased cytokine levels in the present study.Plasma PLP deﬁciency was reported to be an indicator of lowerimmune response in critically ill patients [42], and vitamin B-6 supplementation could improve immunity in critically ill pa-tients [43]. Although we did observe that the injection of PLP resulted in a transient increase in systemic inﬂammatory re-sponses, the elevated serum inﬂammatory cytokine levels inB-6 and O 2þB-6 groups did not deteriorate local lung patho- logical presentation in comparison with the control and O 2 groups.Vitamin B-6 supplementation might have somewhatprotection on tissue functions through an increase in sys-temic inﬂammatory response.Greater immune responses are not always detrimental.
From our data, neonatal rats in control groups were born withelevated TNF- alevels, which might be due to birth stress. Thecytokine overexpression in response to hyperoxia has been reported to have a protective effect by attenuating apoptotic signals.Apoptosis had been reported to be one of the mech-anisms of hyperoxia-induced injury, as the number of cellsundergoing apoptosis increases the longer they are exposed tooxygen and Bcl-2 proteins are known to block the apoptosispathway [44,45] .Studies indicated that the overexpression of IL-6 induced Bcl-2 expression, disrupted interactions betweenproapoptotic and antiapoptotic factors, attenuated H 2O2- induced mitochondrial damage, and prolonged the survival ofmice under hyperoxia environment [46e49].White et al.[50] also proved that parenteral injection of recombinant TNFand IL-1 prolonged the survival of rats in continuous hyper- oxia with greater ratios of reduced to oxidized glutathione in lungs.
The mechanism of vitamin B-6 supplementation onsurvival is through antiapoptosis or the glutathione antioxi-dant system needs further clariﬁed. Numerous treatments that downregulate inﬂammatory responses in a nonspeciﬁc manner have been investigated inhyperoxia-induced neonatal chronic lung disease, includingnonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cortico-steroids [7,9].However, because NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin or ibuprofen) might increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleedingand renal failure, they are thus not considered as a routine therapy in the clinical settings.Although corticosteroids have been shown to reduce neutrophils in mouse BALF and havebeen used in short courses to decrease oxygen demand andhasten extubation in neonatal intensive care units, the majorconcern for the use of corticosteriods is their systemicimmunosuppressive effects.
If hyperoxia also interfered sys-temic immunity in a down-regulated direction at the sametime [51], the risk of infection or sepsis would be increased. By contrast, PLP supplementation in our study increased thesurvival rate and regulated systemic inﬂammation withoutdeterioration or pathological outcomes.The combination of PLP and corticosteroid uses while managing hyperoxia- induced complications could be a possible choice in futureclinical practice.The strength of this study not only provided more patho- physiological information of hyperoxia-induced complica-tions but also offered a new choice in the clinical practice forTable 6 eThe effects of different treatments on oxidative stress and cytokine levels in ﬁrst part of mechanistic study.

We attempted to have an even genderdistribution, but no previous report on gender difference inthe development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is available.The second limitation was that plasma PLP level was onlymeasured in 3 neonatal rats rather than all neonatal rats ineach group of the survival study due to a small amount ofblood can be drawn from each neonatal rat. However, plasmaPLP concentration (n ¼3) signiﬁcantly increased in vitamin B- 6 supplemented groups.In conclusion, neonatal rats receiving hyperoxia treatment suffered divergent inﬂammatory responses and experiencedincreased oxidative stress.Vitamin B-6 supplementation hadbeneﬁcial effects on the inﬂammatory responses and anti-oxidative stress.Additional research is needed to determinethe mechanism underlying the effect of vitamin B-6 onhyperoxia-induced complications.Further study is needed todetermine the optimal timing and dose of vitamin B-6 forneonates who are exposure to hyperoxic conditions.
