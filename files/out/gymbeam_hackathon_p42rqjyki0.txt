BCAA metabolism has been linked with thedevelopment of a variety of tumors. However, the impact of dietary BCAA intake onbreast tumor progression and metastasis remains to be fully explored.Here, weunexpectedly ﬁnd that the elevated BCAA, either in the genetic model or viaincreasing dietary intake in mice, suppresses the tumor growth and lung metastasis of breast cancer.The survival analysis shows that BCAA catabolic gene expression is strongly associatedwith long-term oncological outcomes in patients with breast cancer.In Pp2cm knockout mice in which BCAAs accumulate due to the genetic defect of BCAA catabolism, thebreast tumor growth is suppressed.Interestingly, while the cell proliferation and tumor vasculature remain unaffected, more cell death occurs in the tumor in Pp2cm knockout mice, accompanied with increased natural killer (NK) cells.Importantly, increasing BCAAdietary intake suppresses breast tumor growth in mice.
On the other hand, there are fewerlung metastases from primary breast tumor in Pp2cm knockout mice and the high BCAA diet-fed mice, suggesting high BCAA also suppresses the lung metastasis of breastcancer. Furthermore, low BCAA diet promotes lung colonization of breast cancer cells intail vein model.The migration and invasion abilities of breast cancer cells are impaired byhigh concentration of BCAA in culture medium.The suppressed tumor metastasis and cellmigration/invasion abilities by elevated BCAA are accompanied with reduced N-cadherinexpression.Together, these data show high BCAA suppresses both tumor growth andmetastasis of breast cancer, demonstrating the potential bene ﬁts of increasing BCAA dietary intake in the treatment of breast cancer.

doi: 10.3389/fonc.2022.887257ORIGINAL RESEARCH published: 16 June 2022 doi: 10.3389/fonc.2022.887257 INTRODUCTION Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor among women worldwide ( 1). Current therapies for breast cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine and target therapy.With impr ovements in the accuracy of diagnosis and the development of novel therapeutic agents,mortality from breast cancer has decreased.However, there arestill no effective treatment strategies other than surgery forcertain subsets of breast cancer, particularity the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) ( 2).The reprogramming of metabolism represents an essential hallmark of cancers ( 3–6).Alterations of the uptake and metabolism of nutrients including glucose, amino acids, lipid,and so on, ful ﬁll the tumor growth demands.In addition to glucose and lipid, the metabolic reprogramming of amino acidalso plays critical role in tum or development.
Glutamine, arginine, and glycine are the amino acids extensively studied in breast cancer and other types of cancer ( 7,8). In TNBC, overexpressed SLC1A5, SLC7A5, and SLC6A14 promoteglutamine metabolism and tumor growth ( 9).Promoting BCAA catabolism in TNBC suppresses protein translation,impairs mitochondrial function, and potentiates doxorubicin cytotoxicity ( 10).In addition to tumor growth, metabolic plasticity is also one important characteristic that distinguishesthe tumor cells with high metastatic potentiality from non-metastatic tumor cells.Metastatic cancer cells usually operatemultiple metabolic pathways concurrently to meet their adaptiverequirements ( 11).The role of the immune system in cancer pathogenesis has been a subject of great interest and the metabolic reprogramming also plays a key role in the immune cells ( 12).
For example, lymphocytes require glucose to survive and the increased glucoseconsumption following activation supports their energetic andbiosynthetic demands ( 13). The availability of speci ﬁc nutrient affects the innate and/or adaptive immunity through manipulating T cell expansion and ef ﬁcacy ( 14).Activated NK cells increase the expression of glycolytic enzymes and glucosetransporters to promote glucose uptake and glycolysis ( 15).Therefore, it is unsurprising that the metabolic crosstalk between immune and cancer cells plays a key role in cancerdevelopment.The tumor-derived metabolites, such as adenosine and lactate, can limit the antitumor responses of immune cells (16–18).Tumor-driven glucose restriction in the tumor microenvironment (TME) reduces glucose availability and thusglycolysis in immune cells and impair their anti-tumor functions(19,20).Similarly, tumor cells show increased amino acid consumption ( 21).
Immune cells also show increased amino acid uptake and synergize with tumor-associated cells to create an amino acid-depleted microenvironment. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are three essential amino acids.In mammals, BCAAhomeostasis is controlled by their catabolic pathway.The ﬁrst two steps of BCAA catabolism are shared by the three aminoacids.BCAAs are initially transaminated by branched chain amino transferases (BCATs) to form branched chain a- ketoacids (BCKAs).BCAT1 encodes a cytoplasmic protein andis primarily expressed in the brain, whereas BCAT2 encodes a mitochondrial protein and is ubiquitously expressed.Irreversibleinitiation of BCKA oxidation occurs in the BCAA dehydrogenase(BCKDH) complex.The BCKDH complex is tightly regulated byphosphorylation/dephosphorylation.BCKDH kinase (BCKDK)phosphorylates BCKDHA to suppress BCKDH activity.
The complementary activating dephosphorylation is carried out by the phosphatase PP2Cm encoded by the PPM1K gene ( 22). Emerging evidence has linked BCAA metabolism closely with the growth and progression of various tumors, includingglioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), pancreaticductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and breast cancer (23–27).Recent studies have shown that BCKDK, the key regulator of BCAA catabolism, may act as a pro-metastatic factor in human colorectal cancer ( 28) and HCC ( 29).On the other hand, dietary BCAA supplementation suppresses livertumor growth but promotes PDAC ( 30,31).Other studies report that dietary BCAA levels are positively correlated with the development of tumors such as liver cancer ( 32) and PDAC (31) in mouse.It remains unclear whether BCAA intake inﬂuences breast tumor development and metastasis.Numerus mechanisms have been implicated for BCAA ’s function in cancer.
BCAAs are building blocks for proteins andalso stimulates mTOR signaling pathway to promote tumor growth ( 33) .O n er e c e n ts t u d ys u g g e s t st h a tt h eh i g h l y - expressed BCAT1 in blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia(BC-CML) re-amidate BCKA into BCAA, thus promoting themTOR signaling pathway and the progress of BC-CML ( 34). Another report shows the degradation metabolism of BCAA isinhibited in a variety of tumor types, promoting the accumulation of intracellular BCAA, the activation of mTOR signaling pathway, and the occurrence and development oftumors ( 32).Increased BCAA degradation by BCAT1 overexpression is required for the proliferation, survival, andstemness maintenance of leukemia stem cells viathe restriction ona-KG levels ( 27).Some cancer cells favor BCAA degradation as it provides precursors such as glutamate for the biosynthesis of fundamental building blocks to sustain cancer cell proliferation (24,25).
Here we show that high BCAA suppresses the tumor growth and lung metastasis of breast cancer. The former is linked withenhanced immune function of NK cells and the latter is linkedwith the reduced expression of N-cadherin.Together, these data s u g g e s tt h et r e a t m e n to fb r e a s tc a n c e rm a yb e n e ﬁtf r o m increasing BCAA dietary intake.MATERIALS AND METHODS Western blot SDS lysis buffer was used to harvest cells.For western blot, protein samples were boiled and separated on 8-12% SDS-PAGE gels.Afterblocking with 2% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 1%Tween-20 for 1 hour, the membranes were incubated with speci ﬁc primary antibodies overnight at 4°C.Antibody-bound proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (BIORAD, USA).The b-actin-HRPChi et al.

Cell Lines and Culture Conditions The human breast cancer cell lines LM2 and HEK293T cells weregrown in Dulbecco ’sm o d i ﬁed Eagles ’medium (Hyclone, Beijing) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD).The luciferase-expressingmouse mammary tumor cells 4T1 were cultured in RPMI-1640Medium supplemented with 10% FBS.The mouse mammary tumor cells Py8119 were cultured in DMEM/F12(1:1) Medium containing Hydrocortisone (0.5 mg/ml), mEGF (20ng/ml), Insulin(10 mg/ml) and 10% FBS.All cells applied in this study were cultured at 37°C in a humidi ﬁed 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Cell Number and Viability Analysis by Trypan Blue 2×1 05Py8119 cells were plated in each w ell of 12-well plates. On the next day, the culture medium was changed to medium with differentconcentrations BCAA, and the cells were cultured for 48 hours.Cellswere collected and 10 mL cell suspension were taken, where 10 mLo fa 0.4% (m/v) previously prepared t rypan blue solution was added.After stirring, the mixture was deposited on the cell counting plate.The cell number and viability were measured with automatic cellcounter (Countstar).Independent triplicates were performed byanalyzing three wells per group in each experiment.Orthotopic Allograft Mouse Model Mouse mammary tumor cells Py8119 (1×105) were suspended with Matrigel (3:1) in a total volume of 75 mla n dw e r e orthotopically transplanted directly into the inguinal mammary fat pads of wild type or Pp2cm knockout female mice at the age of 6-7 weeks.The Pp2cm knockout mice were constructed by our laboratory ( 35).
3-4 weeks after injection, mice were euthanized and tumors were dissected and examined for tumor size andimmunohistochemical staining. Tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: tumor volume (cubic millimeters (mm 3)) = 0.5× (length × width2).For the lung metastasis assay, the collected lungs were ﬁxed with formalin and submitted for hematoxylin-eosin staining(H&E).The ﬁxed lung tissue was sent to Google, a biological company, for subsequent paraf ﬁn embedding, sectioning, and staining experiments.TNBC Xenograft Mouse Model Human breast cancer cells LM2 (1×105) were suspended with Matrigel (3:1) in a total volume of 75 ml and orthotopically transplanted into the inguinal mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID female mice at the age of 6 weeks.After injection, micewere feed with normal BCAA diet or high BCAA diet for 8 weeks.The high BCAA diet (Research Diets, Inc, A12030801) was 1.5 times higher than the normal BCAA diet (Research Diets,Inc, A11072001) ( 36).
Eight weeks after injection, mice were euthanized and tumors were dissected and examined for tumorsize and immunohistochemical staining. Tumor volume was measured weekly and calculated as before described.Tail Vein Injection Assay The 5-6-week-old BALB/C mice were obtained from SLACLaboratory Animals Company Limited, Shanghai, China.Thepurchased mice were transferred to Animal facility for 3 days and pretreated with a low BCAA diet (LBCAA, Research Diets, Inc, A12030802) or a normal BCAA diet (NBCAA, Research Diets,Inc, A11072001) for 2 weeks ( 36).BALB/C mice (n = 10, 11 per group) were injected in their tail veins with 5×10 5Luciferase- expressing 4T1 cells.After injection, BCAA diets were continuedto the end of experiment.To investigate tumor metastasis, 12 days after injection, each mouse was intraperitoneally injected 200 mg/ kg D-Luciferin.Bioluminescence was analyzed by IVIS system.
Flow Cytometry Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-096-730) wasused for single cell suspensions from mouse tumor tissue. Thesingle cell suspension of spleen was obtained by grinding, andwhite blood cells were obtained by 5% Ficoll density gradient centrifugation.Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution (10×) (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-094-183) was used to remove the erythrocytes.Forcell-surface analysis, cells were stained with Fixable ViabilityStain 780 (BD Horizon, #565388), anti-mCD45(BD Pharmingen,#561087), anti-mCD3e (BD Pharmingen, #557984), anti-mCD4(BD Pharmingen, #561831), anti-mCD8a (BD Pharmingen, #561109), anti-CD11b (BD Pharmingen, #561098), anti-mF4/ 80 (BD Pharmingen, #743280), anti-mCD86 (BD Pharmingen,#564198) in recommended antibo dy concentrations and incubated at 4°C for 30 min.
For the NK intracellular IFN- g (BD Pharmingen, #562333) and granzymeB (Miltenyi Biotec,#130-101-356) cytokine staining, cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized after stimulation with Leuko Act Cktl with GolgiPlug (BD Pharmingen, #550583) for 6 h. For the CD206 (BD Pharmingen, #565250) and NK1.1 (BD Pharmingen,#563220) staining, cells were also ﬁxed and permeabilized.Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm Soln Kit (BD Pharmingen, #554714) was used to ﬁx and permeabilize the cells.Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo version 10.Wound Healing Cell Migration Assay 2×105LM2 cells were cultured in a six-well plate (5×105cells were cultured in a 6cm plate) until 90-100% con ﬂuence and then carefully scratched with a 10 ml/200 ml pipette tip.After washing three times with 1×PBS to remove detached cells, the culturemedium was changed to BCAA gradient medium.The BCAAgradient medium was formulated with BCAA-free DMEM and BCAA chemicals.
Images in 3 different wound ﬁelds were captured at respective time points (0h and 48h) to evaluate themigration of cells. Transwell Assay (Cell Migration and Invasion Assay) Chambers (#3422, 8µm pore, Corning, NY, USA) without or with matrigel (#356234, BD Biosciences, CA, USA) were used toinvestigate migration and invasion ability of cells, respectively.Chi et al.BCAA Suppresses Breast Cancer Frontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 887257 3 Systems without Matrigel were used to measure the migration ability of cells.BCAA concentration gradient medium was used inthe experiment.2×10 4cells suspended in 100 mL serum-free medium were seeded onto the upper chamber of 24-well plates,and 700 mL of medium with 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber.22 hours later, the medium was removed from the upper chamber.
The cells on the membrane were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, and the cells were stained with0.1% of crystal violet (Sangon Biotech) overnight at 37°C. Thennon-invading cells on the upper side of the chamber were gentlyremoved thoroughly with a clean wet cotton swab and rinsed inclean water and dried overnight in oven at 37°C.Finally, the stained cells were counted by microscopy.Results represent the average number of cells in three ﬁelds per membrane and the experiment was repeated three times independe ntly.As for cell invasion assays, the matrigel was di luted according to the manufacturer ’s recommendations and added onto the chambers before seedingcells, then performed in the same m anner as cell migration assays.Animals All animal experiments were performed in accordance with relevant institutional and national guidelines and regulations ofShanghai Medical Experimental Animal Care Commission.
Kaplan-Meier Plotter and Oncomine Analysis The prognostic signi ﬁcance of the mRNA expression of BCAA catabolism genes in TNBC was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier plotter (www.kmplot.com), an online database includinggene expression data and clinical data. With the purpose to assessprognostic value of a speci ﬁc gene, the patient samples were divided into two cohorts according to the median expression of the gene (high vs.low expression).The relapse-free survival(RFS) of TNBC patients was analyzed by using a Kaplan-Meiersurvival plot.Log rank p-value and hazard ratio (HR) with 95%conﬁdence intervals were calculated.The Affymetrix ID of each gene in this study: BCAT2 (ID203576 at), BCKDK (ID202030 at), PPM1K (ID244011 at).The individual gene expression level of BCAT2 ,BCKDK and PPM1K was analyzed by Oncomine.The mRNA levels of cancer vs.normal patient datasets were compared.1.25fold change, p-value=0.05, and top 10% gene rank were selected as threshold.
Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0Software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The results were expressed as mean ± SD.1-way ANOVA or a two-tailed Student ’s t test was performed to analyze the statistically signi ﬁcance.P-values < 0.05 was considered as signi ﬁcant.*p < 0.05; **p < 0 01; ***p < 0.001.RESULTS BCAA Metabolic Remodeling Is Strongly Associated With Breast Cancer Prognosis To understand the role of BCAA metabolism in breast cancer in human, we analyzed the BCAA metabolic gene expression inhuman breast tumors using Oncomine database.Among the genes involved in the initial 2 shared steps, the mRNA expressionofBCAT2 and BCKDK was signi ﬁcantly higher, whereas the expression of PPM1K was lower, in the invasive carcinoma than that in normal breast tissue ( Figures 1A –C).The prognostic value of BCAA metabolic gene mRNA expression in breast cancer was assessed according to relapse-free survival (RFS) using Kaplan –Meier plotter.
The Kaplan-Meier plotter revealed that the higher level of BCAT2 was correlated with preferable RFS ( Figure 1D ). Increased expression of BCKDK was correlated with poor outcome in breast cancer patients(Figure 1E ).Breast cancer patients with up-regulated PPM1K demonstrated better RFS ( Figure 1F ).These results suggest that BCAA metabolic reprogramming is strongly associated withoutcome in breast cancer patients.Elevated BCAA Inhibits Breast Tumor Growth in the Orthotopic Allograft Model We investigated the impacts of elevated BCAA on breast tumor progression in Pp2cm -diﬁcient mice in which BCAA accumulated due to the impaired BCAA catabolism (Figure 2A )(35).As expected, the plasma levels of BCAA were elevated in Pp2cm -diﬁcient mice, compared with those in the control wildtype mice ( Figure 2B ).We constructed an orthotopic allograft model using Py8119, a kind ofmurine TNBC cell line ( 37), in Pp2cm -diﬁcient and control mice.
Unexpectedly, the tumor growth was signi ﬁcantly suppressed in Pp2cm knockout mice ( Figure 2C ). To explore the underling mechanism, we assessed the cell proliferation, cell death, and angiogenesis in tumor tissues inPp2cm -deﬁcient and control mice.Immunohistochemistry staining showed no signi ﬁcant differences in the expression of proliferation markers Ki67 ( Figure 2D ) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) ( Figure 2G ) and angiogenesis marker CD31 ( Figure 2F ).Unexpectedly, the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 was signi ﬁcantly up-regulated in the tumor in Pp2cm - deﬁcient mice, compared with those in the control wildtype mice (Figures 2E, G ).We assessed the direct impacts of high level BCAA on breast cancer cell growth and death in vitro .The concentration of BCAA in Dulbecco ’s Modi ﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) is 800 mM, higher than their fasting plasma levels (~50-200 mM) under physiological conditions.
Py8119 cells were cultured withdifferent concentrations of BCAA in medium. High level ofBCAA did not suppress breast cancer cell growth ( Figure 2H ) or induce cell death ( Figure 2I ).Therefore, the increased cell death in tumors in Pp2cm -deﬁcient mice was unlikely resulted from the direct effects of BCAA on cancer cells.Together, theseresults suggested high BCAA suppressed TNBC tumor growthby promoting tumor cell death viaan indirect mechanism.Elevated BCAA Enhances the Activity of NK Cells Immune system plays an important anti-tumor role in the development of cancer.We then analyzed the immuneresponses to TNBC tumor in Pp2cm -deﬁcient mice.The populations of macrophage, NK cells, CD4 +T cells, CD8+TChi et al.

Among the tumor-in ﬁltrating immune cells, no difference was detected for the populations of macrophage,type-I macrophage, type-II macrophage, CD4 +T cells, and CD8+ T cells ( Figures 3F –L).However, the populations of NK cells and NK cells expressing IFN- gwere signi ﬁcantly increased in the tumors in Pp2cm knockout mice ( Figures 3I, J ).These results suggested that high BCAA enhanced the activity of tumor-inﬁltrating NK cells which could kill cancer cells and inhibit tumor development.
Increasing Dietary BCAA Intake Suppresses Breast Tumor Growth in the Orthotopic Xenograft Model We next investigated whether increasing dietary BCAA intake could affect breast cancer progression in an orthotopic xenograftmodel. The human breast cancer cell LM2 was injected into theinguinal mammary fat pad of female non-obese diabetic/severecombined immunode ﬁciency (NOD/SCID) mice.Mice were fed with different BCAA diets for 8 weeks ( Figure 4A ).The plasma concentrations of BCAA in the high-BCAA diet (HBCAA)-fed mice were signi ﬁcantly higher than those in the normal-BCAA diet (NBCAA)-fed group ( Figure 4B ).Importantly, the tumor mass in the HBCAA-fed mice was signi ﬁcantly smaller than that in the NBCAA-fed group ( Figure 4C ).HBCAA signi ﬁcantly inhibited the rate of tumor growth ( Figure 4D ).
In agreement with the orthotopic allograft model ( Figures 2E, G ), signi ﬁcantly up-regulated apoptosis marker in the orthotopic xenografttissues of HBCAA group was observed, compared with that of NBCAA group ( Figures 4E, F ). In NOD/SCID mice, the adaptive immune system is de ﬁcient, accompanied with normal macrophage and low NK cell activity.Macrophage population showed no difference in tumor(Figure 4G )o rs p l e e n( Figure 4H ) between HBCAA and NBCAA groups.However, HBCAA feeding increased the population of NK cells ( Figure 4I ) and NK cells expressing granzyme B ( Figure 4J ) in spleen.The populations of tumor- inﬁltrating NK cells ( Figure 4K ) and NK cells expressing granzyme B ( Figure 4L ) were not signi ﬁcantly changed.High BCAA Inhibits the Lung Metastasis of Breast Cancer The vast majority of breast cancer deaths are due to metastasis but not the primary tumor ( 38).
To gain insight into the impacts of elevated BCAA on breast cancer metastasis, the tumor metastases in lung tissues was analyzed in the Pp2cm knockout and wildtype mice bearing tumor under inguinalmammary fat pads. Interestingly, the lung metastases in Pp2cm knockout mice were less than those in the control group(Figures 5A –C).In addition to the genetic mouse model in which BCAA was elevated, we also analyzed the impacts of altering BCAA dietary intake on breast cancer metastasis.The tail-vein-metastasismodel was established by injecting luciferase-expressing 4T1cells in wildtype mice, and low BCAA diet signi ﬁcantly promoted lung colonization of breast cancer cells in this model(Figures 5D –F).Overall, these results provide evidence that high BCAA inhibits lung metastasis of breast cancer.AB DE FC FIGURE 1 | BCAA metabolic remodeling is strongly associated with breast cancer prognosis.

BCAA Suppresses Breast Cancer Frontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 887257 5 High BCAA Inhibits Breast Cancer Cell Migration, Invasion, and the Expression of N-Cadherin To determine whether BCAA directly affected breast cancer cell migration, the transwell assay was conducted with differentconcentrations of BCAA in culture medium. The resultsshowed that the migration of LM2 was inhibited when BCAAlevel increased ( Figures 6A, B ).Wound healing assay also showed high BCAA in medium inhibited the migration ability of breast tumor cells ( Figures 6C, D ).In addition, the invasion ability of LM2 was also suppressed by high level of BCAA(Figures 6E, F ).PP2cm expression is low in LM2 cell.It remains unclear whether inactivation of PP2Cm makes thesame impacts on breast cancer cell migration and invasion.The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process strongly associated with tumor progression,invasion, and metastasis ( 39,40).
As the concentration of BCAA increased in the culture medium, the expression of N-Cadherin, a key mesenchymal marker, dramatically decreased in LM2 cells (Figure 6G ). The expression of N-Cadherin was also decreased in tumor tissues of HBCAA-fed mice in the orthotopic xenograftmodel ( Figure 4F ).On the other hand, the expression of E- Cadherin, Slug, and Vimentin showed no difference betweendifferent BCAA groups ( Figure 6G ).Furthermore, N-Cadherin expression was down-regulated in the breast tumor tissues in Pp2cm knockout mice compared with that in control mice, but the expression of E-Cadherin and Vimentin was notchanged ( Figure 6H ).A B D E FG I HC FIGURE 2 | Elevated BCAA inhibits orthotopic tumor growth of breast cancer.(A)The orthotopic allograft model.(B)The serum BCAA concentration of tumor- bearing mice after 6 hours of fasting.Mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, Student ’s t-test.

Tumor cells oftenoutcompete immunocytes for nutrients, leading to impeded immune function and tumor immunological evasion ( 41,42). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the elevated BCAAenhances NK cell activity in breast tumors viaovercoming the BCAA inef ﬁciencies in TME.The mechanism underlying BCAA-promoted NK activity remains to be investigated.mTOR signaling pathway can beactivated by BCAA ( 33).mTORC1 activity is essential for NK cell development and activation-induced functional responses inmature NK cells, including the expression of effector molecules IFN-gand granzyme B ( 15,43,44).In the current study, high BCAA increases the secretion of IFN- gand granzyme B by NK cells in tumor-bearing mice.Thus, BCAA may enhance NK cell AB DE F GI H JKLC FIGURE 3 | High BCAA enhances NK cell immune function in tumor-bearing mice.

Studies have demonstrated that increased N-cadherin expression enhances the migratory and invasive capacities of multiple types of epithelial cancer cellsin vitro (45). Moreover, the facilitation of tumor distant metastasis by N-cadherin expression has been demonstrated inmouse tumor models of breast cancer, pancreatic cancer,prostate cancer, and melanoma ( 46,47).Therefore, N-cadherin might act as an important mediator for BCAA-suppressed cancer metastasis.Meanwhile, how BCAA suppresses N-cadherin expression remains unclear.The survival analysis suggests that BCAA metabolic reprogramming is strongly associated with the outcome ofbreast cancer patients.The increased BCKDK and the downregulated PPM1K expression indicate suppressed BCAAcatabolism is associated with poor survival.This correlation is in line with previous report showing suppressed BCAA catabolismpromotes cancer cell proliferation ( 32).
Based on this correlation, increasing BCAA intake would likely promote tumorprogression. However, our data show that increasing BCAAintake suppresses tumor progression.This unexpected result has been correlated with enhanced immune function by elevated BCAA in animals.Thus, when BCAA is elevated, theirpro-immune impacts on immunocytes overcomes their pro-tumor impacts on cancer cells, leading to suppressed tumorgrowth.In this way, even the impaired BCAA catabolism intumor cells is correlated with poor survival, the elevatedenvironmental BCAA could be correlated with better survival.Given that commercial BCAA products are easily available, these data suggest increasing BCAA intake may provide apractical dietary approach to slow the tumor progression andboost the immunotherapy of breast cancers.Further studies ofBCAA ’s impacts on other types of cancers will provide more insights.A B D EFC FIGURE 5 | High BCAA inhibits the lung metastasis of breast cancer.
