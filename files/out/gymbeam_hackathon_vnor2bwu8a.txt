Paulo Donato Castellane, s/n, Jaboticabal, S ~ao Paulo, 14884-900, Brazil ABSTRACT The maternal diet and egg incubation temperature are some of the factors that can in ﬂuence the embryonic development and performance of thenewly chicks at 15 d of age. This study evaluated the effects of adding a blend of organic acids, essential oils, curcumin, tannins, vitamin E, and zinc microencapsu-lated in to the diet of female quails ( Coturnix coturnix japonica ) on their productive, reproductive performance and redox parameters of their eggs and the interactionof maternal diet £incubation temperature on embryo (E16 andE18) and chicks development.At 98 d of age, 64 female quails with a mean body weight of 150 g §0.5 were distributed into two treatments: a B ASAL diet or a diet supplemented with blend ( SANNIMIX ).The eggs from each female were incubated at 37.5°C (C ONTROL ) and 38.5°C (H IGHTEMPERATURE ) throughout the incuba- tion period.
After hatching, chicks were distributed in a2 (maternal diet) £2 (incubation temperature) factorial design. Female quails supplemented with S ANNIMIX showed better productive and reproductive performanceand produced higher-quality embryos.Their offspring had greater weight at hatch and at 15 d of age.The eggsand offspring of supplemented with S ANNIMIX female quails showed better oxidative stability.At E16 and E18, H IGHTEMPERATURE increased yolk sac utilization and gene expression of the growth hormone receptor(GHR ).At E16, embryos from supplemented with S AN- NIMIX female quail had higher expression of insulin-like growth factor type I ( IGFI ) and heat shock protein 70 kDa genes.At 15 d of age, highest expression of theGHR andIGFI genes was observed in chicks from female quails fed the S ANNIMIX diet, regardless of incubation temperature.
Regarding the maternal diet £incubation temperature an improved result was observed for chicksfrom female quails fed with S ANNIMIX even when eggs are exposed to H IGHTEMPERATURE during the incubation. The supplementation of quail diets with blend S ANNIMIX improves productive and reproductive performance, eggquality and their embryos, as well as their offspringquality.Key words: high incubation temperature, maternal effect, phytogenic additive, progeny, redox balance 2024 Poultry Science 103:104022 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2024.104022 INTRODUCTION Several strategies can be used to improve breeder pro- duction, egg quality, and progeny performance in an ef ﬁ- cient and economical way.One strategy is maternal dietmodulation, a topic that has taken center stage in poul- try production in recent years.It is known that the maternal diet exerts signi ﬁcant effects on egg concentra- tions of hormones, nutrients, and other components(Groothuis et al., 2019 ).
However, intergenerational, transgenerational, and multigenerational phenomenarelated to maternal effects are still little explored in birds(Zimmer et al., 2017 ;Verwoolde et al., 2021 ). These fac- tors are particularly important because embryonic development depends exclusively on the maternal diet, which directly in ﬂuences egg composition and can/C2112024 Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Asso- ciation Inc.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-NDlicense ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).Received February 5, 2024.Accepted June 19, 2024.1Corresponding author: gasparinoeliane@gmail.com 1 positively or negatively affect chicks development during pre- and post-hatching phases ( Videla et al., 2020 ; Andrieux et al., 2022a ).
Previous studies have reported bene ﬁcial effects asso- ciated with maternal supplementation with differenttypes of nutrients and natural feed additives, both inlaying breeder hens, Japanese quail and their offspring(Gong et al., 2020 ;Videla et al., 2020 ;Amevor et al., 2022). Phytogenics such as essential oils, curcumin, and tannins contain bioactive components with positive effects on animal health ( Abdelli et al., 2021 ).Organic acids are also part of the additives used in animal nutri-tion for their multiple bene ﬁcial effects, including reduc- tion of harmful bacteria and enhanced absorption ofpeptides and minerals ( Khan and Iqbal, 2016 ).Feed additives, alone or in combination, have a long historyof use in bird nutrition, with satisfactory effects on ani- mal growth, gastrointestinal health, reproductive perfor- mance, and immune response ( Abdelli et al., 2021 ;Saleh et al., 2021 ), representing promising alternatives to growth promoters.
Additives such as vitamin E and zinc act as antioxi- dants in the animal body ( Tsiplakou et al., 2021 ). These compounds are valuable in laying bird diets.In the lay-ing period, continuous ovulation and egg production place intense demands on body metabolism, increase the production of oxidative species, and reduce the body ’s capacity to eliminate them, making birds more suscepti-ble to oxidative stress ( Zou et al., 2007 ).In excess, oxi- dative substances may damage biomolecules (DNA,lipids, and proteins), affecting not only the generalhealth of birds but also the composition and quality oftheir eggs, which in turn may limit embryo survival and decrease chick quality ( Alagawany et al., 2017 ;Peixoto et al., 2020 ).In addition to maternal effects, developing embryos are subject to environmental effects, such as incubationtemperature ( El-Shater et al., 2021 ;Andrieux et al., 2022b ;Abuoghaba et al., 2023 ).
Inadequate incubation temperatures can reduce yolk sac utilization by theembryo, resulting in low-quality chicks ( Dayan et al., 2020). Oscillation of incubation parameters is another harmful factor in ﬂuencing embryo development, as it increases the production of oxidative species.Given thatthe antioxidant capacity of bird embryos is typicallylow, temperature oscillations make them more vulnera-ble to oxidative stress ( Surai et al ., 2016 ).Enhancing thermotolerance and antioxidant capacity in birdembryos through thermal control during incubation pro- tects embryonic tissues and represents a strategy that prepares animals to better endure the oxidative chal-lenges associated with hatching and post-hatching(Surai, 2000 ;Saleh et al., 2020 ).
Despite the numerous studies addressing the effects of maternal diet and incubation temperature on the devel-opment of the offspring in the short and long term, thissubject has not yet been fully elucidated and little is known about whether factors such as maternal diet and incubation temperature can interact in a way that mod-ulate the development of the embryo and chick afterhatching. In view of the foregoing, we hypothesized that the addition of a blend of essential oils of cinnamon, eugenol, thymol, and oregano, organic acids (citric acid,fumaric acid, sorbic acid and malic acid), curcumin, tan-nins, vitamin E, and zinc microencapsulated in vegeta-ble fat to female quail diets exerts bene ﬁcial effects on the productive and reproductive performance ofbreeders and leads to the production of fertile eggs withsuperior nutritional quality and oxidative stability, resulting in improved progeny quality.
A second hypoth- esis is that the maternal diet can interact with incuba-tion temperature to in ﬂuence embryonic development and the performance of the progeny at 15 d of age. Totest these hypotheses, we evaluated the followingparameters: productive and reproductive performance offemale quail, oxidative stability of eggs, expression ofgenes involved in the growth axis and cellular protection against oxidative damage during the embryonic period and in the progeny during the initial and growth phases,and progeny oxidant-antioxidant metabolism during thegrowth phase.MATERIALS AND METHODS Ethic Statement The experiment was carried out at the Iguatemi Experimental Farm, at the State University of Maring /C19a (Maring /C19a-Paran /C19a, Brazil), in accordance with the guide- lines of the Ethics Committee on the Use of Animals(project approval number 6098240322) of the State Uni-versity of Maring /C19a, Brazil.
Two hundred laying quail ( Coturnix coturnix japon- ica) (100 females and 100 males) were obtained from a commercial breeding center and raised conventionally (separated by sex) in an air-conditioned environmentfrom 1 to 42 d of age. The birds were raised in collectivemetal cages (50 £50£50 cm 3- ten birds/cage) (Choc- master, BR), equipped with manual tube type feederwith tray and drinkers.The quails received bran feedformulated with corn and soybean meal to meet theirnutritional needs according to their age ( Table 1 ).Drinking water and feed were provided ad libitum , and feeding was done twice in the morning and afternoon.The room temperature was adjusted according to the age of the quails, and in the ﬁrst 7 d of life the tempera- ture was maintained in the range of 36 to 38°C, from theeighth to the 14th day of life the temperature was main-tained in the range of 32 to 35°C and from the 15th dayof life to 42 d of life the temperature was maintained in the range of 26 to 28°C.
The relative humidity of the air was maintained in the range of 60 to 70%. On the ﬁrst day of life, the chicks received continuous light and fromthen on, the light program was 23 hours of light per day.At 42 d, the quails (n = 100) were transferred to a lay- ing house and maintained in individual metal cages(0,15 m 2/quail; n = 100 cages) (Chocmaster, BR) equipped with manual trough type feeder and automatic linear nipple type drinkers.From 42 d of age onward, the birds were maintained under arti ﬁcial lighting (16 h2 PONTES ET AL.of light and 8 h of dark) using yellow incandescent light at an intensity of 10 lux.All birds were fed a basal dietuntil 98 d of age.During this period, bird developmentand laying rate were monitored daily, and the femalequails had ad libitum access to water and feed.Feedingwas done twice in the morning and afternoon.
Diets(bran feed) were made with corn and soybean meal and were formulated to meet the nutritional requirements of birds in each developmental phase, according to Ros- tagno et al. (2017) (Table 1 ).At 98 d of age, 64 female quails with a mean body weight of 150 g §0.5 and a laying rate of approximately 85% were distributed in a completely randomized designwith two dietary treatments, namely a B ASAL diet and the same diet supplemented with a blend of essential oils of cinnamon, eugenol, thymol, and oregano, organic acids (citric acid, fumaric acid, sorbic acid and malicacid), essential oils, curcumin, tannins, vitamin E, andzinc microencapsulated - S ANNIMIX (Table 1 ).The blend was mixed into the diet manually and then by amixer at a rate of 1 kg of blend per 1000 kg of diet.Eachgroup comprised 32 female quails, and each quail wastreated as an experimental unit and a replication.
At 42 d of age, the males were (n = 100) transferred to individual metal cages (0,15 m2/male, n = 100 cages) (Chocmaster, BR) equipped with manual trough typefeeder and automatic linear nipple type drinkers, in thelaying house, separately from the females. At 98 d of age, males (n = 64) with a mean body weight of approxi-mately 135 g §0.25 were selected to be used in the experiment.Males were used only for mating andreceived a basal diet (made with corn and soybean meal,bran feed) formulated according to Rostagno et al.(2017) .Drinking water and feed were provided ad libi- tum, and feeding was done twice in the morning and afternoon.Seven d after birds began to be fed experi-mental diets (B ASAL diet or S ANNIMIX diet), males were placed in contact with females for 1 h once a day during21 d.Possible paternal effects were minimized by rotat-ing mating pairs.Egg production was recorded during the ﬁrst 10 d of mating.
Eggs produced between d 11 and 21 were identi- ﬁed, counted, weighed, and stored in a controlled-temper- ature environment at 22°C. On the 21st day of mating,all collected eggs were incubated.At the end of the exper-imental period (126 d of age), birds were slaughtered bycervical displacement and processed for analysis.Productive Performance, Reproductive Performance, and Relative Organ Weights The productive performance of female quails (n = 32 birds/treatment) during the experimental period (98 toTable 1.Composition of pre-experimental and experimental diets for quail ( Coturnix coturnix japonica ) layers.

Egg laying rate %ðÞ ¼ egg number 28x100 ð3Þ For assessment of reproductive performance, after slaughter, the ovaries of birds were excised and maturepre-ovulatory and pre-hierarchical follicles were extracted and photographed with a digital camera (Nikon Coolpix L315). Follicles were counted and thecircumference (mm) of pre-ovulatory follicles was mea-sured by image analysis using Image-Pro Plus version4.0 (Media Cybernetics).Effect of Maternal Diet on Egg Oxidative Stability On the last day of egg collection (end of experimental period), 16 eggs were randomly selected from breeders fed the B ASAL diet (n = 8) and the S ANNIMIX diet (n = 8).Shortly after collection, the eggs were partially openedand disposable Pasteur pipettes were used to separatelycollect about 1.5 mL of albumen and 1.5 mL of yolk intocryogenic tubes.Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogenand stored in a freezer at /C080°C until analysis.
Egg Incubation and Chick Assessment On the last day of egg collection, eggs from both die- tary groups (B ASAL diet, n = 200; S ANNIMIX diet, n = 200) were acclimated to ambient temperature (22°C) and stored individually in fruit nets. Subsequently,eggs were placed in 2 incubators (Chocmaster Luna 240) programmed at 37.5°C (C ONTROL TEMPERATURE ;BASAL diet, n = 100; S ANNIMIX diet, n = 100) and 38.5°C (H IGH TEMPERATURE ;B ASAL diet, n = 100; S ANNIMIX diet, n = 100), throughout the incubation period.Both incu-bators were maintained at a relative humidity of 60%with automatic egg turning every 2 h.To minimize theeffect of storage days, we adopted a block distribution ofeggs in incubators according to the day of collection.From the 16th to the 18th day of incubation, the egg turning system was deactivated and hatches weremonitored.Newly hatched chicks were weighed to obtain the weight at hatch.
In addition to hatching assessments, 6 eggs were randomly collected from eachof the four groups (maternal diet £incubation tempera- ture) on the 16th and 18th day of incubation for analysisof embryo development at ages E16 and E18. Embryos were separated from the egg, and the resid- ual yolk sac was excised and weighed.The embryo wasweighed together with extraembryonic membranes to estimate yolk sac utilization, as described by Dayan et al.(2020) .Liver specimens were collected into cryogenic tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in a freezer at/C080°C for gene expression analysis.The number of live chicks and total hatching rate ( equation 4 ) were also determined.Total hatching rate %ðÞ ¼ number of hatched eggs number of incubated eggsx100 ð4Þ Shortly after hatch, 240 healthy chicks (females and males) were weighed (average weight 8.45 g §0.81) and distributed according to a completely randomized designwith a 2 £2 factorial arrangement (maternal diet£incubation temperature).
Each experimental group consisted of 6 replicates of 10 birds. The chickswere raised in boxes on the ﬂoor (1 m 2), with the ﬂoor lined with corrugated cardboard in an air-conditioned environment at the thermal comfort temperature fromthe 1st to the 15th day of age The feed and potablewater was provided in feeders and baby drinkers, respec-tively, suitable for the breeding and rearing phases.Thechicks were fed a basal feed (made with corn and soy-bean meal, bran feed) formulated to meet nutritionalrequirements in the starter phase (1 −15 d).The starter diet contained 2898.958 kcal/kg (apparent metaboliz- able energy) and 20.694% crude protein ( Rostagno et al., 2017 ).The chicks had free access to water and feed for 15 d of life.The feeding was done twice in the morn-ing and afternoon.
Ambient temperature during the ﬁrst 7 d of the chicks live was maintained within a range of 36 to 38°C and,from the eighth until 15th day of life, the ambient tem- perature was gradually reduced until reaching the tem- perature range of 32 to 28°C. The relative humidity wasapproximately 60% (1 to 15 d).On the ﬁrst day of life, the chicks received 24 h continuous light and from thenon, the light program was 23 hours of light per day.At 15 d, 6 birds were selected from each treatment based on the mean weight of the group ( §5%) and were sacriﬁced by cervical displacement for collection of liver and intestinal tract specimens (small and large intes- tines).Organs were weighed and relative organ weightswere calculated according to equation 5 .Relative organ weight %ðÞ ¼organ weight bird weightx100 ð5Þ The length of the intestinal tract was also measured.Shortly after weight measurements were taken, fragments4 PONTES ET AL.

Gene Expression Analysis Total RNA was extracted from the liver of embryos (E16 and E18) and 15-day-old chicks with Trizol (Invi-trogen, Carlsbad, CA), as per the manufacturer ’s instructions.Total RNA concentration was measured at260 nm by using a NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Wilmington, DE).RNA purity and integrity were assessed by determining the260/280 and 260/230 nm ratios, respectively; valuesranged from 1.9 to 2.1.RNA samples were treated withDNase I (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to themanufacturer ’s recommendations.Complementary DNA ( cDNA ) was synthesized using the GoScript Reverse Transcription kit (Promega Corporation, Madi- son, WI), according to the manufacturer ’s instructions.
Real-time polymerase chain reactions ( RT-qPCR ) were performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix(Applied Biosystems, San Francisco, CA). The ampli ﬁca- tion reaction mixture consisted of 5 mLo fc D N Aa t4 0n g / mL, 0.5 mLo fe a c hp r i m e ra t1 0 mM(ﬁnal concentration of 200mM), 12.5 mLo fS Y B RG r e e nP C RM a s t e rM i x ,a n d 6.5mL of ultrapure water in a ﬁnal volume of 25 mL.The reactions were performed in duplicate.For all genes evalu- ated, thermal cycling param eters were those recommended by the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix kit.The annealingtemperature for all primers was 60°C.Primers for thegrowth hormone receptor ( GHR ), insulin-like growth fac- tor I (IGFI ), and heat shock protein 70 kDa ( HSP70 ) genes were designed based on gene sequences deposited atwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (accession numbers NM00100 1293.1, FJ977570.1, and NM001006685.2, respectively).Theb-actin gene was used as the endogenous reference gene ( Table 2 ).

The principle of the MDA quanti ﬁcation method lies in the reaction of thiobarbituric acid with hydroperoxidedecomposition products, including MDA ( Buege and Aust, 1978 ). Reactions were performed using 100 mg of sample (Supplementary material S2).The absorbancewas read spectrophotometrically at 535 nm (Evolution300 UV-VIS, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Madison, WI).A quanti ﬁcation factor was derived from a standard curve of MDA, prepared from a solution of 1,1,3,3-tetraethox- ypropane (Sigma −Aldrich, Darmstadt, DE) at 0.03 mM.MDA contents were calculated by the equa- tion 7 .MDA nmol per mg protein ðÞ ¼ Sample absorbance x quantificantion factor sample protein contentð7Þ Protein oxidation was assessed by quantifying car- bonylated proteins in albumen, yolk, and liver sam- ples.The method is based on the reaction of 2,4- dinitrophenylhydrazine ( DNPH ,S i g m a −Aldrich, Darmstadt, DE) with carbonyls, as described by Lev- ine et al.(1994) .
Analytical procedures were per- formed as described by Khatlab et al. (2019) .Absorbance readings were taken at 370 nm on anEvolution 300 UV-VIS spec trophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Madison, WI).Results are expressed as nmol carbonyl groups per mg protein.The total protein content of albumen, yolk, and liver sampleswas determined by the Bradford method ( Bradford, 1976).Statistical Analysis The UNIVARIATE procedure of SAS 2002 (version 9.00, SAS Inst.Inc., Cary, NC) was applied to test the normality of the data.Subsequently, the data were ana- lyzed using the PROC GLM procedure.Diet Effects on Quail Hen Performance and Egg Oxidative Stability Diet effects on the productive and reproductive perfor- mance of quail hens and on the oxidative stability of eggswere analyzed by one-way analysis of variance(ANOVA ).
The statistical model was Yij = m+a i+eij, where Y ijis the dependent variable, mis the overall mean, aiis the diet effect (i = B ASAL or S ANNIMIX ) and e ij is the residual error term. Means with signi ﬁcant effects were compared by Student ’st-test ( P≤0.05).Effects of Maternal Diet and Incubation Temperature on Progeny Performance To understand how maternal diet and incubation temperature in ﬂuence the response of the progeny to their environment during incubation and in the early development phase, we subjected data collected from embryos (E16 and E18) and 15-day-old chicks to two-way ANOVA.The statistical model wasY ijk=m+ai+tj+atij+e ijk, where Y ijkis the depen- dent variable, mis the overall mean, aiis the main maternal diet effect (i = B ASAL or S ANNIMIX ),tjis the main incubation temperature (j = C ONTROL TEMPERA- TURE or H IGHTEMPERATURE ),atijis the interaction effect between maternal diet and incubation temperature, and eijkis the residual error term.
Main and interaction effects of maternal diet and incubation temperature were considered. When theinteraction effect was signi ﬁcant, means were compared by post hoc Tukey ’s test ( P≤0.05).Otherwise, when there was no signi ﬁcant interaction effect, but there was a signi ﬁcant effect of maternal diet and/or incubation temperature, the means were compared by Student ’st- test ( P≤0.05).When there were no signi ﬁcant interaction effects on liver antioxidant parameters, we chose to analyze theeffect of maternal diet separately within each incubationtemperature group.RESULTS Productive Performance There was a signi ﬁcant effect of maternal diet on egg weight ( P= 0.0241) and pre-hierarchical follicle number (P= 0.0155).Female quails fed the S ANNIMIX diet produced heavier eggs and greater number of pre-hierarchical folliclesthan hens fed the B ASALdiet ( Table 3 ).
There was no effect of the diet on the other evaluated parameters of productiveand reproductive performance ( P>0.05) ( Table 3 ). Effect of Maternal Diet on the Prehatch Environment of the Progeny: Egg OxidativeStability The effects of S ANNIMIX supplementation of female quail on the pre-hatch environment of the progeny were6 PONTES ET AL.investigated by examining the oxidant/antioxidant sta- tus of egg albumen and yolk ( Table 4 ).SOD (P= 0.0016) and CAT ( P= 0.0357) activities were approximately 20% and 31% lower, respectively, in thealbumen of eggs from female quails fed the S ANNIMIX diet as compared with the B ASAL diet group.Additionally, the albumen of eggs from supplemented (S ANNIMIX ) female quails had higher GSH content ( P= 0.0083) and lower protein oxidation ( P= 0.0183).In contrast to the albumen, the yolk of eggs from female quails fed the S AN- NIMIX diet showed higher SOD activity ( P= 0.0001), with values 57% higher than that of the B ASAL diet group.
For yolk CAT activity ( P<0.0001), there was a 57% reduction with S ANNIMIX diet compared with the BASAL diet. Furthermore, the egg yolk of the supple- mented group (S ANNIMIX ) showed higher antioxidantcapacity ( P= 0.0004) and lower protein oxidation (P= 0.0059).Effect of Maternal Diet and Incubation Temperature on Early Chick Development The effects of maternal diet and incubation tempera- ture on residual yolk sac percentage at E16 and E18,total hatching rate, number of live chicks, and weight athatch are presented in Table 5 .There were no signi ﬁcant interaction effects of maternal diet and incubation tem- perature on the evaluated parameters.However, we found that the incubation temperature in ﬂuenced the percentage of residual yolk sac.Embryos incubated atH IGHTEMPERATURE had lower percentage of residual yolk sac at E16 ( P= 0.0011) and E18 ( P= 0.0001) than embryos incubated at the C ONTROL TEMPERATURE .
Regarding the maternal diet effect, we observed that theprogeny of S ANNIMIX -supplemented female quails had a lower percentage residual yolk sac at E18 ( P= 0.0059), higher total hatching rate ( P= 0.0093), and higher weight at hatch ( P= 0.0307) than the progeny of quail hens fed the B ASAL diet. The results for GHR, IGFI , and HSP70 expression at E16 and E18 are shown in Table 6 .There was no signi ﬁ- cant interaction effect on gene expression in the liver ofembryos at E16.However, the main effects of incubation temperature and maternal diet were signi ﬁcant.Embryos incubated at H IGH TEMPERATURE showed higher GHR expression than the C ONTROL TEMPERATURE (P<0.0001), and embryos from female quails supple- mented with S ANNIMIX showed higher expression of IGFI andHSP70 than embryos from unsupplemented female quails ( P= 0.0376 and P<0.0001, respectively).
At E18, GHR and IGFI expression was signi ﬁcantly in ﬂu- enced by maternal diet £incubation temperature effects (P= 0.0075 and P= 0.0126, respectively). The highest and lowest expression of GHR was observed, respec- tively, in chicks from the B ASAL diet£HIGH Table 4.Effects of maternal diet on the oxidant/antioxidant status of female quails ( Coturnix coturnix japonica ) eggs (pre-hatch envi- ronment).

The progeny of S ANNIMIX -supplemented female quails had higher relative liver weight(P= 0.0168) and intestinal weight ( P= 0.0220) at 15 d of age, as well as greater intestinal length ( P= 0.0261), than the progeny of unsupplemented female quails (Table 7 ). There were interaction effects of maternal diet and incubation temperature on GHR, IGFI , and HSP70 expression in the liver of progeny at 15 d of age ( Table 8 ).Chicks from S ANNIMIX -supplemented female quails showed increased expression of GHR andIGFI , regard- less of egg incubation temperature.Among chicks from unsupplemented female quails, GHR and IGFI expres- sion was higher in chicks incubated at H IGHTEMPERA- TURE during embryo development.HSP70 expression was highest in chicks of the S ANNIMIX diet£CONTROL TEMPERATURE group (7.39 AU), followed by chicks of the SANNIMIX diet£HIGHTEMPERATURE group (6.33 AU).
Among chicks from unsupplemented female quails, nosigniﬁcant differences in HSP70 expression were observed between incubation temperature groups. There were no signi ﬁcant interaction effects on oxi- dant/antioxidant status parameters in the progeny liver(P>0.05).Variables did not differ within the C ONTROL TEMPERATURE group (37.5°C); therefore, the effects of maternal diet were analyzed only within the H IGHTEM- PERATURE group (38.5°C).The results are shown in Table 9 .Maternal diet in ﬂuenced the total ROS content (P= 0.0259), SOD ( P= 0.0429) and CAT ( P= 0.0418) activities, antioxidant capacity ( P<0.0001), and conju- gated diene content ( P= 0.0026) of 15-day-old chicks.The progeny of S ANNIMIX -supplemented female quailsshowed higher total ROS content ( »16%), SOD ( »16%) and CAT ( »18%) activities, antioxidant capacity (»8%), and conjugated diene content ( »24%) than the progeny of unsupplemented female quails.

Sannimix: basal diet supplemented with blend organic acids,essential oils of cinnamon, eugenol, thymol, and oregano, curcumin, tannins, vitamin E, and zinc microencapsulated in vegetable fat; High Temperat ure: incubation temperature 38.5°C; Control Temperature: incubation temperature 37.5°C; Basal: basal diet.MATERNAL AND INCUBATION ENVIRONMENT ON THE PROGENY 9 (small white follicles). Female quails supplemented with SANNIMIX had a higher number of pre-hierarchical fol- licles.Our results suggest that S ANNIMIX components (mixture of organic acids, essential oils, curcumin, tan-nins, vitamin E, and zinc) have the ability to synergisti-cally protect against and minimize follicular atresia,which can be caused by several factors, including oxida- tive stress ( Gupta et al., 2006 ;Amevor et al., 2021 ).
Egg-laying breeders undergo intense metabolic activ- ity throughout egg formation, increasing their suscepti-bility to oxidative stress and other adversecircumstances that may not be apparent ( Wang et al., 2017). According to Ma et al.(2020) , the laying perfor- mance of birds is likely to be improved through nutri-tional manipulations that favor ovarian development.Thus, to ensure bird health and, consequently, high egg production and quality, attention must be paid to thefeed and nutrients used in maintenance and breederdiets ( Wang et al., 2017 ).After the ban of antibiotics as growth promoters in bird diets, studies have soughtalternative feed supplements capable of ensuring healthand enhancing the quantitative and qualitative produc-tion parameters of animals in an ef ﬁcient, safe, and eco- nomical way ( Gerzilov et al., 2015 ).
Studies found positive effects of maternal supplementation with differ-ent types of natural feed additives on breeder perfor-mance, egg quality, and progeny quality ( Gong et al., 2020;Saleh et al., 2021 ;Amevor et al., 2022 ). Phytogenics, that is, additives derived from plants (e.g., essential oils of cinnamon, eugenol, thymol, and oreg-ano, curcumin, and tannin), have shown promising results.This class of compounds contains bioactive com- ponents such as polyphenols, terpenoids, phenolics, gly-cosides, and alkaloids, known for their positive effects onanimal health ( Barbieri et al., 2017 ;Abdelli et al., 2021 ).These bioactive components have antimicrobial, antioxi- dant, and anti-in ﬂammatory properties and can improve liver function ( Abou-Elkhair et al., 2014 ;Abdelli et al., 2021).
Some phytogenics have an estrogenic effect: they bind to estrogen receptors and promote biologicalresponses similar to those produced by endogenousestrogen ( Wistedt et al., 2012 ;Saleh et al., 2021 ). Phyto- genics stimulate the gastrointestinal system, leading to increased production of digestive enzymes and feed ef ﬁ- ciency ( Abdelli et al., 2021 ).Organic acids (e.g., citric, fumaric, sorbic, and malic) are also used as additives in animal nutrition for theirability to maintain intestinal morphology, promote theequilibrium of intestinal microbiota (intestinal health),and increase the absorption rate of peptides and miner-als (Khan and Iqbal, 2016 ).
Microminerals and vitamins, such as zinc and vitamin E, have also been widely inves- tigated as dietary supplements in laying breeders,mainly because of their antioxidant properties ( Huang et al., 2019 ;Yu et al., 2020 ;Amevor et al., 2022 ) and effects on hatchability, fertility, and egg quality ( Li et al., 2019 ;Amevor et al., 2021 ,2022). In recent studies, zinc and vitamin E were used, alone and combined, inpoultry and laying hens diets, affording satisfactory effects on animal growth, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and immune system health, and product quality (meatand eggs) ( Abdelli et al., 2021 ;Saleh et al., 2021 ;Zhao et al., 2021 ;Xiao et al., 2022 ).These additives were pro- posed as major candidates to replace traditional growthpromoters, prebiotics, and probiotics ( Abou-Elkhair et al., 2018 ).
Therefore, our results suggest that a mixture of organic acids, essential oils, curcumin, tannins, vitamin E, and zinc microencapsulated may have a bene ﬁcial effect on the reproductive performance of laying hens,given that the optimal reproductive ef ﬁciency of laying birds is achieved when follicular development results ina well-distinguished, organized follicular hierarchy,where large pre-ovulatory follicles are selected from a setof small growing follicles ( Johnson, 2012 ). Female quails fed the S ANNIMIX diet had a higher total hatching rate, produced eggs with higher weight, andproduced progeny with higher weight at hatch.In ovipa-rous species, the embryo develops independently in theegg, and all nutrients needed for such development aredeposited in the egg during its formation ( Willems et al., 2014).
As the nutrients needed for embryo development derive from the maternal organism, it is crucial that nutrients be adequately used and metabolically trans- formed by breeders for ef ﬁcient embryo development and chick viability at hatching ( Vieira, 2007 ). Therefore, our results suggest that maternal supplementation withS ANNIMIX contributed positively to all stages of egg for- mation, resulting in improved progeny quality.Theseeffects might have occurred because of the synergisticproperties of the mixture of organic acids, essential oils, curcumin, tannins, vitamin E, and zinc components, including effects on feed ef ﬁciency ( Abdelli et al., 2021 ), estrogenic effect ( Saleh et al., 2021 ), antioxidant effectTable 9.Effects of maternal diet on the oxidant/antioxidant sta- tus of 15-day-old quail ( Coturnix coturnix japonica ) chicks from eggs incubated at High Temperature (38.5°C).

(Lee et al., 2019 ;Nawab et al., 2019 ;Amevor et al., 2022), hepatoprotective and oviprotective effects ( Ame- vor et al., 2021 ).The components are also known to pro- mote liver lipid metabolism ( Bastos et al., 2017 ), intestinal health and function ( Wang et al., 2019 ;Iqbal et al., 2021 ), and embryo development ( Huang et al., 2019).In this study, we investigated the effects of maternal diet on egg quality by analyzing the oxidative stability of albumen and yolk.In the albumen of eggs from S ANNI- MIX-supplemented female quails, we found lower SOD and CAT activities, higher GSH content, and lower pro-tein oxidation than in the albumen of eggs from unsup-plemented female quails.
Albumen serves mainly as anatural defense for yolk, in both table and fertile eggs,because of its structural arrangement and composition(Obianwuna et al., 2022a ). Albumen is also the main source of protein for tissue synthesis during incubation (Willems et al., 2014 ).When laying hens are at the peak of ovulation and laying, they become more susceptibleto oxidative stress because of the higher generation ofoxidative species and reduced capacity to eliminatethem ( Zou et al., 2007 ).Under these conditions, birds may suffer damage to the oviduct, with consequentreduction in protein synthesis, negatively impacting the nutritional and antioxidant capacity of the albumen (Obianwuna et al., 2022a ).
Furthermore, during bird embryonic development, metabolic rates are high, and itis assumed that pre-hatching growth is related to highgeneration of ROS and reactive nitrogen species ( RNS ), compounds that can cause lipid peroxidation and pro-tein and DNA oxidation, compromising embryo develop-ment ( Surai et al., 2016 ). In order to prevent damage to biomolecules, the organism has a defense system com- posed of enzymatic (e.g., SOD, CAT, and glutathioneperoxidase) and non-enzymatic (e.g., GSH, vitamin E,and zinc) antioxidants.The defense system is activatedto keep ROS/RNS at low levels without completelyeliminating them ( Surai et al., 2019 ).Studies have shown that the transfer of maternal diet- derived antioxidants to the egg can protect egg compo- nents, embryos, and hatchlings against oxidative stress (Surai et al., 2016 ;Yu et al., 2020 ;Obianwuna et al., 2022b ).
Thus, the lower SOD and CAT activities and protein oxidation in egg albumen of S ANNIMIX -supple- mented female quails suggest better oxidative stabilityof the albumen. Furthermore, the higher GSH concen-tration in the albumen may be an indicator of greaterantioxidant protection ( Surai, 2000 ).Our results suggest positive effects of female quails supplementation with S ANNIMIX on the redox balance of the albumen, leading to low albumen levels of oxidative substances that canattack the yolk and germinal disc.We observed greater SOD activity in the yolk (pri- mary source of nutrients) of eggs from S ANNIMIX -supple- mented female quails.This compartment contains thegerminal disc and is home to the main initial processes of embryogenesis, having, therefore, greater sensitivity to ROS/RNS, even at low, non-harmful levels.The lowerCAT activity may indicate accumulation of hydrogenperoxide generated during dismutation of the superoxide anion, initiated by SOD.
However, we also observed lower protein oxidation and higher antioxidant capacity,suggesting that bioactive compounds present in the mix-ture of organic acids, essential oils, curcumin, tannins,vitamin E, and zinc (S ANNIMIX ), continued the antioxi- dant defense process initiated by SOD, effectively pro-tecting yolk from oxidation. These results allow us tosuggest that, in eggs from female quails supplemented with a mixture of organic acids, essential oils, curcumin, tannins, vitamin E, and zinc microencapsulated, theantioxidant action of bioactive compounds occurs syner-gistically (or additively) with enzymatic (here repre-sented by SOD and CAT) and non-enzymatic (hererepresented by GSH) antioxidant systems.The resultsrevealed better oxidative stability of eggs from S ANNI- MIX-supplemented female quails, translating into better egg quality, as con ﬁrmed by the higher egg weight, total hatching rate, and weight at hatch of this group.According to Dixon et al.
(2016) , the ﬁrst experiences lived by animals in the pre-laying and egg incubationperiods contribute to determining offspring phenotypeand post-hatching performance. Our experiment wasdesigned to test whether maternal diet and incubationtemperature in ﬂuence embryo development and bird performance at the beginning of the growth phase.We observed that embryos of the S ANNIMIX maternal diet£HIGHTEMPERATURE group had lower percentage of residual yolk sac (i.e., higher utilization) thanembryos of the B ASAL maternal diet £CONTROL TEMPER- ATURE group.Assessment of residual yolk sac utilization provides information on embryonic development andnutritional status; the lower percentage of the residual yolk sac during the pre-hatching period, indicates better the absorption and utilization of nutrients by theembryo, resulting in higher-quality embryos and chicks(Dayan et al., 2020 ).
Furthermore, greater absorption of residual yolk sac by embryos positively affects theimmune status of newly hatched birds, as maternal anti-bodies are transferred to offspring via the yolk and albu-men ( Ozayd {n and Celik, 2014 ). Studies have shown that an increase or decrease in the ideal incubation tem- perature (37.8°C) may in ﬂuence the use of residual yolk sac by embryos ( Willemsen et al., 2010 ;Ozayd {n and Celik, 2014 ;Dayan et al., 2020 ).As discussed by Dayan et al.(2020) , incubation tem- perature in ﬂuences the expression of genes involved in different metabolic pathways in yolk sac tissues, suggest-ing an effect on yolk and yolk sac utilization.These changes may positively or negatively impact the quality of embryos and chicks in adulthood.
Gene expressionanalysis revealed better development of embryos fromS ANNIMIX -supplemented female quails (upregulation of IGFI andHSP70 at E16 and E18) and those from eggs incubated at H IGHTEMPERATURE (upregulation of GHR at E16), demonstrating that the maternal diet can exertbeneﬁcial effects on offspring by in ﬂuencing different metabolic pathways during embryo development. Here, although we observed a positive effect of high incubation temperature (38.5°C) on embryoMATERNAL AND INCUBATION ENVIRONMENT ON THE PROGENY 11 development, such bene ﬁcial effects did not seem to per- sist during chick growth (15 d of age).At 15 d of age, chicks from eggs incubated at H IGHTEMPERATURE had lower body weight and weight gain than chicks fromeggs incubated at the C ONTROL TEMPERATURE .In con- trast to incubation temperature effects, maternal dieteffects did extend up to 15 d of age.
The offspring offemale quails supplemented with S ANNIMIX showed higher live weight, weight gain, liver weight, intestinal weight, intestinal length, and GHR and IGFI expres- sion. The higher expression of somatotrophic axis genes might have contributed to the results observed at 15 dof age, as activation of this metabolic axis promotes met-abolic balance and growth ( Cong et al., 2023 ).The length and relative weight of the intestine may serve asindicators of organ development (proliferation, hyper- plasia, and cell hypertrophy), organ function, and physi- ological state ( Zhong et al., 2019 ).According to Alyileili et al.(2020) , the longer the intestinal length, the greater the nutrient absorption.In line with our results, Rebel et al.(2006) found that maternal diet persistently in ﬂu- ences the timing, development, and functionality of theoffspring ’s intestine.
Furthermore, the higher liver weight of the progeny of supplemented hens might be related to the greater functional activity of the organ, which assists digestion and assimilation of nutrientsabsorbed by the intestinal mucosa. Together, these ﬁnd- ings suggest that addition of a mixture of organic acids,essential oils, curcumin, tannins, vitamin E, and zincmicroencapsulated to female quails diets had positiveshort- and long-term effects on embryo and chick devel-opment.
We believe that these effects may be a re ﬂection of the maternal transfer of bioactive components of the additive ( Obianwuna et al., 2022b ) to the egg, thereby promoting oxidative stability of the embryo in the pre-hatch environment and protection against free radicalattack, especially during the ﬁnal incubation period, in which animals are most vulnerable to oxidative stress.In addition, egg protection can modulate hormone levelsand other essential nutrients, affecting chick ﬁtness and phenotype later in life ( Andrieux et al., 2022a ). The effects of maternal diet (S ANNIMIX or B ASAL diet) among chicks from eggs incubated at H IGHTEMPERATURE (38.5°C) on the oxidative/antioxidant status at 15 d ofage were also evaluated here.The progeny of femalequails fed the S ANNIMIX diet showed higher total ROS content, conjugated diene content, SOD and CAT activ-ities, and antioxidant capacity than the progeny of quail hens fed the B ASAL diet.
Given that chicks were reared under ideal conditions of temperature and diet ( ad libi- tumaccess to feed and water) from 1 to 15 d of age and that supplemented female quails did not show signs ofstress, we suggest that the oxidative stress of chicks inthis group occurred as an effect of the high incubationtemperature. As stated by Bateson et al.(2014) , in natu- ral populations of animals, when breeding environments differ from the optimum, there is a mismatch between the phenotype of the individual and the real environ-mental conditions, leading to disastrous consequenceson animal ﬁtness and health.Zimmer et al .(2017) sug- gest that, in precocious birds such as quail, pre-hatching stress appears to have a strong effect on the adult pheno-type.On the other hand, our ﬁndings showed that the S AN- NIMIX diet improves the antioxidant status of progeny at 15 d of age.
There seemed to be a balance between theamount of ROS and antioxidants in 15-day-old chicks.Although chicks produced a greater amount of ROS, causing an increase in primary lipid peroxidation (conju- gated dienes), the occurrence of secondary lipid peroxi-dation ( MDA ) and protein oxidation was not observed, indicating that the greater antioxidant defense capacityof these animals (attributed to the maternal diet effect)allowed for interruption of oxidative reactions and con-tainment of ROS. In addition, the progeny of S ANNIMIX - supplemented female quails also showed greater HSP70 expression.Heat shock prontein 70 kDa is involved in the protection of biomolecules and maintenance of cellu-lar homeostasis, being possibly related to the protectiveeffect of the maternal diet, contributing to the adapt-ability of animals to challenges encountered in the post-hatch phase.
In conclusion, we found that an incubation tempera- ture of 38.5°C did not negatively affect embryo develop- ment or hatching but did impair chick performance at 15 d of age, possibly because of oxidative stress (duringtheﬁnal incubation phase), among other factors. How- ever, addition of a blend of the organic acids, essentialoils, curcumin, tannins, vitamin E, and zinc microencap-sulated to the diet of female quails had positive effectson breeder, egg, and offspring performance.In addition,maternal supplementation with a mixture of organic acids, essential oils, curcumin, tannins, vitamin E, and zinc microencapsulated improved the oxidative stressresponses of 15-day-old chicks from eggs incubated at38.5°C.
Our results demonstrate the greater importance of adding natural additives (nutraceuticals) and functionalnutrients to the maternal diet, considering that onefemale quail can produce 100 chicks by year, and that the maternal environment can be altered by the diet to produce bene ﬁcial effects, preparing the progeny to face the challenges to which they will be subjected in thefuture environment. However, although our results dem-onstrate relevant results, some limitations are still foundin these topics, such as the time of supplementation ofthe breeders, the levels of natural additives that can beadded to the diets of the breeders, the best time during incubation to change the temperature, the duration of the temperature increase and the level of temperatureincrease.Therefore, more studies are needed to betterunderstand these limitations.
