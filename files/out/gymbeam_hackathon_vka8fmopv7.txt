The somatic maturity estimation for the female swimmers was mistakenly based on the male equations.Thus, the somatic maturity of the female swimmers was re-calculated using the female- speciﬁc equation by Mirwald et al.[ 2].The corrected table appears below.The corrected values do not change the results and scientiﬁc conclusions of the article.Table 1.Participants’ physical and training characteristics and 24 h energy and macronutrient consumption.
