Abstract: The aim of this study was to microencapsulate probiotic bacteria ( Lactobacillus acidophilus 11073) using whey-protein-isolate (WPI)–octenyl-succinic-anhydride-starch (OSA-starch)-complex coacervates and to investigate the effects on probiotic bacterial viability during spray drying, simu- lated gastrointestinal digestion, thermal treatment and long-term storage.
The optimum mixing ratio and pH for the preparation of WPI-OSA-starch-complex coacervates were determined to be 2:1 and 4.0, respectively. The combination of WPI and OSA starch under these conditions produced micro- capsules with smoother surfaces and more compact structures than WPI-OSA starch alone, due to the electrostatic attraction between WPI and OSA starch.As a result, WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules showed signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) higher viability (95.94 ±1.64%) after spray drying and signiﬁcantly (p< 0.05 ) better protection during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, heating (65◦C/30 min and 75◦C/10 min) and storage (4/25◦C for 12 weeks) than WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules.These results demonstrated that WPI-OSA-starch-complex coacervates have excellent potential as a novel wall material for probiotic microencapsulation.Keywords: probiotic; microencapsulation; whey-protein isolate; octenyl-succinic-anhydride starch; complex coacervation 1.
Introduction Probiotics are living microorganisms that can provide a lot of beneﬁts to the health of a host when properly ingested [ 1,2]. Many probiotics, including Biﬁdobacterium ,Lactobacillus and others, have been widely used in functional foods, beverages and so on [ 1,3].However, the instability of probiotics during food processing, human gastrointestinal digestion, long- term storage and more is still a great challenge [ 4,5].Microencapsulation is considered to be an effective method to provide physical protection, and thereby increase the viability of probiotics [ 6].Among the various microencapsulation methods, spray drying is considered to be one of the most widely used methods due to its moderate price, ease of operation, continuous production and excellent safety [7].It is universally acknowledged that the choice of wall materials is of great importance for microencapsulation [ 8].
For the microencapsulation of probiotics, proteins and polysac- charides are the most commonly used wall materials [ 9]. Proteins have good ﬁlm-forming properties, but are easily degraded by pepsin in gastric ﬂuids and have a tendency to ag- gregate [ 10].Polysaccharides can maintain their stability in the stomach due to their good resistance to acid and pepsin, which can improve the compactness of the microcapsules Molecules 2023 ,28, 5732.https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28155732 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules Molecules 2023 ,28, 5732 2 of 14 and be beneﬁcial for the targeted release of probiotics.On the other hand, polysaccharides generally cannot provide adequate protection for probiotics due to their poor ﬁlm-forming properties and the large pores between their molecular chains [ 11].Therefore, compared to protein/polysaccharide alone, the probiotic microcapsules with higher encapsulation viability and more stability could be prepared by the combination of them [10,11].
Whey-protein isolate (WPI), isolated from cheese-making waste, is an attractive en- capsulant as it has been found to be effective in protecting probiotic bacteria during spray drying [ 12]. However, WPI cannot provide an effective moisture barrier and therefore cannot effectively protect probiotics during storage due to its hydrophilic nature [ 12,13].Octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) starch, i.e., starch modiﬁed with OSA groups (an esteri- fying agent), has been recognised as a safe polysaccharide by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [ 7,14].The hydrophobicity of OSA starch is relatively high with a contact angle of about 80◦due to the presence of lipophilic octenyl groups [ 15,16].In addition, the digestibility of OSA starch was relatively low due to the spatial obstruc- tion caused by the OSA groups, which reduces its contact with digestive enzymes [ 17].
According to Wang et al., the relatively high hydrophobicity (contact angle of 76.10◦) and digestion resistance of modiﬁed starch (propionylated potato starch) was beneﬁcial in protecting probiotics during spray drying, simulated gastrointestinal (SGI) digestion and storage [ 18]. OSA starch alone cannot provide sufﬁcient protection for probiotics during spray drying.As reported by Cruz-Ben ítez et al.[ 19], the viability of Lactobacillus pentosus in OSA starch microcapsules after spray drying was only about 65%.The weak protective effect of the OSA starch microcapsules could be attributed to the poor solubility and ﬁlm- forming property of OSA starch, resulting in an uneven ﬁlm formation at the beginning of the drying process and therefore the shrunken and wrinkled surfaces of the spray-dried microcapsules [19,20].
Complex coacervation is one of the most commonly used methods for combining protein with polysaccharide, which occurs as a phase separation of the water solution containing them with opposite electrical charges and the formation of a coacervate layer surrounding the bioactive compound [ 21]. Probiotic microcapsules formed via complex coacervation have advantages in encapsulation viability, protective capability, controlled release, etc.[ 9].To date, complex coacervates of pea-protein isolate–sugar-beet pectin, sodium caseinate–sugar-beet pectin, soy-protein isolate–pectin, soy-protein isolate–peach- gum polysaccharide, WPI–gum arabic, soy-protein isolate–carrageenan, casein–chitosan and others have been used for probiotic microencapsulation [ 9,10,21–23].However, the use of WPI-OSA-starch-complex coacervates in probiotic microencapsulation has not been reported.
Therefore, in the present study, WPI-OSA-starch-complex coacervates were used as the wall material for Lactobacillus acidophilus encapsulation via spray drying. The SGI digestion, thermal resistance and storage properties of microencapsulated and free probiotic bacteria and the physicochemical properties and microstructure of probiotic microcapsules were further investigated.2.Results and Discussion 2.1.Formation of WPI-OSA-Starch-Complex Coacervates 2.1.1.Turbidity Complex coacervation of charged protein and polysaccharide can be reﬂected by the change in turbidity of the solution at the macroscopic level.Therefore, turbidity titration has usually been used to investigate the whole process of complex coacervation and to measure the conditions under which the maximum complex coacervates can be formed [ 24].As shown in Figure 1a, the turbidity of the WPI-OSA-starch mixtures increased ﬁrstly and then decreased as the pH lowered from 2.0 to 6.5.
The pHopt was determined to be 3.8, 3.9, 4.0 and 4.1 when the mixing ratios were 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1, respectively. These results indicated that an increase in WPI in the mixture required an increase in the pHopt, similar to the report of Qiu et al.[ 25] and Tian et al.[ 26].In addition, the maximum turbidity value was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the mixing ratio.As the mixing ratio of Molecules 2023 ,28, 5732 3 of 14 WPI-OSA starch was 0.5:1, i.e., the amount of WPI was lower than that of OSA starch, only weak interactions occurred between WPI and OSA starch, resulting in relatively low turbidity.Similar phenomena have also been reported for other combinations of protein polysaccharide, such as hemp-protein isolate–gum arabic, gelatin–OSA-modiﬁed kudzu starch and others [ 27,28].The reason for this can be attributed to there being too many anionic groups in the polysaccharide, resulting in strong electrostatic repulsion between them.
As the mixing ratio increased, the turbidity ﬁrst increased and then decreased. The highest turbidity was observed when the WPI-OSA starch ratio was 2:1 and the pH was 4.0, indicating the formation of WPI-OSA-starch complex coacervates with maximum insolubility and stability.Similar phenomena were also observed by Plati et al.[ 27] and Tian et al.[ 26].Thus, this is the possible optimum mixing ratio for the correct saturation of the charged sites of the OSA with WPI molecules [ 27].Turbidity decreased when the ratio was further increased to 3:1; this was also in agreement with the report of Plati et al.[ 27] and Tian et al.[ 26] and could be attributed to an excess of WPI in the solution, which could not bind to the OSA starch, being replaced by protein self-aggregation [ 27].This assumption was supported by a shift of pHopt closer to the PI of WPI.
Molecules 2023 , 28, 5732 3 of 14 As shown in Figure 1a, the turbidity of the WPI-OSA-starch mixtures increased ﬁrstly and then decreased as the pH lowered from 2.0 to 6.5. The pHopt was determined to be 3.8, 3.9, 4.0 and 4.1 when the mixing ratios were 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1, respectively.These results indicated that an increase in WPI in the mixture required an increase in the pHopt, similar to the report of Qiu et al.[25] and Tian et al.[26].In addition, the maximum tur- bidity value was signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced by the mixing ratio.As the mixing ratio of WPI- OSA starch was 0.5:1, i.e., the amount of WPI was lower than that of OSA starch, only weak interactions occurred between WPI and OSA starch, resulting in relatively low tur- bidity.Similar phenomena have also been repo rted for other combinations of protein pol- ysaccharide, such as hemp-protein isolate–gum arabic, gelatin–OSA-modi ﬁed kudzu starch and others [27,28].
The reason for this can be a ttributed to there being too many anionic groups in the polysaccharide, resulting in strong electrostatic repulsion between them. As the mixing ratio increased, the turbidity ﬁrst increased and then decreased.The highest turbidity was observed when the WPI-OSA starch ratio was 2:1 and the pH was 4.0, indicating the formation of WPI-OSA-starch complex coacervates with maximum in- solubility and stability.Similar phenomena were also observed by Plati et al.[27] and Tian et al.[26].Thus, this is the possible optimum mixing ratio for the correct saturation of the charged sites of the OSA with WPI molecules [27].Turbidity decreased when the ratio was further increased to 3:1; this was also in agreement with the report of Plati et al.[27] and Tian et al.[26] and could be a ttributed to an excess of WPI in the solution, which could not bind to the OSA starch, being replaced by protein self-aggregation [27].
This assump- tion was supported by a shift of pHopt closer to the PI of WPI.

Zeta Potential As the complex coacervation of protein and polysaccharide is mainly motivated by electrostatic attraction, their zeta potential could provide important information about the interaction between them, as well as the formation and stability of complex coacervates [ 29]. As shown in Figure 1b, the zeta potential of the WPI decreased with increasing pH from 3.0 to 6.0 and changed from positive to negative at about pH 4.5, which is its IEP , similar to the previous report [ 30].In contrast, OSA starch mainly maintained a negative charge and decreased with increasing pH from 3.0 to 6.0, which is similar to the previous report of Zhao et al.[ 28].The zeta potential of all the WPI-OSA-starch blends was intermediate between the two single biopolymers.The IEP was found to be 3.83 at a mixing ratio of 0.5:1 (WPI-OSA starch).
When the mixing ratio of WPI-OSA starch was increased from 0.5:1 to 3:1, the IEP values also increased, reaching a maximum of 4.13 at a mixing ratio of 3:1 (Figure 1b). Similar phenomena have been observed previously for other combinations of protein polysaccharide, e.g., hemp-protein isolate–gum arabic, pea-protein isolate–beet pectin and others [27,29].2.1.3.Comparison of IEP and pHopt As shown in Figure 1c, the pHopt determined via turbidimetric analysis at each mixing ratio approximately coincided with the IEP .This phenomenon is consistent with the previ- ous reports that the maximum turbidity of the mixed solutions of protein polysaccharide is generally observed at their IEP [ 27,31,32], conﬁrming again that electrostatic interaction is the main driving force for the complex coacervation.2.1.4.
Yield of Complex Coacervates As shown in Figure 1d, at a total polymer concentration of 1%, the yield of the complex coacervates increased with increasing WPI-OSA-starch-mixing ratio and the highest amount of complex coacervates (78.33 ±2.24%) was formed when the WPI-OSA-starch-mixing ratio was 2:1, which corresponded to the highest turbidity. A similar yield of complex coacervates has also been obtained for other systems, such as WPI–quince-seed mucilage, soybean-protein isolate–soluble dietary ﬁber of Sichuan pepper seed and others [ 31,33].However, as the mixing ratio was further increased, the yield of the complex coacervates started to decrease, which was attributed to the fact that the excess WPI was unable to bind with the OSA starch and remained soluble in the equilibrium phase [ 34].In addition, the yield of WPI-OSA-starch-complex coacervates increased to 83.73 ±2.75% as the total biopolymer concentration increased to 5%, similar to the report of Bhargavi et al.[ 35].
The reason for this can be attributed to the increased number of charged sites available for electrostatic interaction at a high biopolymer concentration [35]. Therefore, the conditions for the preparation of WPI-OSA-starch-complex coacervates for probiotic encapsulation were selected as follows: mixing ratio 2:1, pH 4.0, total polymer concentration of 5%.2.2.FTIR Spectroscopy Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectroscopy of probiotic microcapsules.For WPI microcap- sules, it is noticeable that the peaks at 1645 cm−1, 1539 cm−1and 1240 cm−1were related to the amide I (C=O stretching), amide II (N-H bending) and amide III (C-N stretching and N-H deformation) of WPI, respectively [ 36].For OSA-starch microcapsules, the peak at 3000–3500 cm−1was related to the O-H stretching of hydroxyl groups.The peaks at 1725 and 1572 cm−1were observed for the stretching vibration of C=O and asymmetric stretching of COO–, respectively [ 37].
The FTIR spectrum of WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules was the combination of the FTIR spectrum of WPI microcapsules and OSA-starch microcap- sules, although the location of the peaks was slightly changed, consistent with the report of Naderi et al. [ 38] and Zhang et al.[ 39].In addition, the peaks shifted from 1645 cm−1and 1539 cm−1in the WPI microcapsules to 1650 cm−1and 1544 cm−1in the WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules, respectively, similar to the report of Naderi et al.[ 38] and Zhang et al.[ 39].Molecules 2023 ,28, 5732 5 of 14 Furthermore, the peaks of OSA starch at 1725 cm−1and 1571 cm−1disappeared in the WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules, similar to the report of Zhao et al.[ 28].The above changes conﬁrmed the electrostatic attraction between the carboxyl groups (-COO−) of OSA starch and the amine groups (-NH3+) of WPI.

Microscopic Observations of Mi crocapsules Containing Probiotics Fluorescence microscopy was used to con ﬁrm the presence of probiotic bacteria in the microcapsules. As shown in Figure 3a, after labelling with RBITC, free probiotic bac- teria can be seen in red under the ﬂuorescence microscope, similar to the report by Peñalva et al.[23].Although there is some overlap, the encapsulation of probiotic bacteria in WPI, OSA-starch and WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules can still be con ﬁrmed by the presence of red ﬂuorescence in all microcapsules (Figure 3b–d).The microstructure of the spray-dried micr ocapsules containing probiotics is also shown in Figure 3e–g.The sizes of the three microcapsules showed almost no di ﬀerence.Some hollows and wrinkles were observed in both WPI microcapsules and OSA-starch mi- crocapsules, which may result from the denaturation of WPI and the shrinkage of the OSA starch, respectively, during the spray-drying process [13,20].
The combination of WPI and OSA starch produced the microcapsules with compact structures, smooth surfaces and almost no wrinkles, which can be attributed to the electrostatic attraction between WPI and OSA starch, preventing the shrinkage of OSA starch during spray drying [20]. In addition, almost no probiotic bacteria were visible on the surf ace of all spray-dried mi crocapsules, suggesting that the probiotic bacteria were em bedded in the coacervate network.Figure 2.FTIR spectrogram of WPI microcapsules, OSA-starch microcapsules and WPI-OSA- starch microcapsules.2.3.Microscopic Observations of Microcapsules Containing Probiotics Fluorescence microscopy was used to conﬁrm the presence of probiotic bacteria in the microcapsules.As shown in Figure 3a, after labelling with RBITC, free probiotic bacteria can be seen in red under the ﬂuorescence microscope, similar to the report by Peñalva et al.[ 23].
Although there is some overlap, the encapsulation of probiotic bacteria in WPI, OSA- starch and WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules can still be conﬁrmed by the presence of red ﬂuorescence in all microcapsules (Figure 3b–d).

The viability of microencapsulated probiotic bacteria was 91.32 ± 1.87% and 70.75 ± 2.05% in WPI microcapsules and OSA-starch microcapsules, respec-tively. The low viability of probiotics in OSA-starch microcapsules after spray drying was also reported by Cruz-Benítez et al.[19], and could be a ttributed to the poor solubility and poor ﬁlm-forming property of OSA starch, resulting in uneven ﬁlm formation at the be- ginning of the drying process and shrunken an d wrinkled surfaces of the spray-dried mi- crocapsules [19,20].Table 1.Probiotic viability, water content and wate r activity of spray-dried microcapsules.

The high viability of probiotic bacteria in the spray-dried WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules prod uced here may also be due to the smooth surfaces and the compact structures of the mi crocapsules [1,40]. In addition, the hydroxyl groups of OSA starch could form hydrogen bo nds with the cell membrane of probiotics, eﬀectively reducing heat damage and protecting the cell membrane from degeneration during spray drying [9].Similarly, signi ﬁcantly ( p < 0.05) higher probiotic viability after spray drying was also found in soy-protei n-isolate–peach-gum-polysaccharide, soy-pro- tein-isolate–pectin, WPI– Momordica charantia -polysaccharide microcapsules than that in protein/polysaccharide-only microcapsules and free bacteria [9,10,41].On the other hand, decreased encapsulation viability was report ed when shellac was incorporated into WPI- based microcapsules, which could be a ttributed to the excessive hydrophobicity of shellac (the contact angle of shellac powder of 152.3°) [13,42].Figure 3.

The combination of WPI and OSA starch produced the microcapsules with compact structures, smooth surfaces and almost no wrinkles, which can be attributed to the electrostatic attraction between WPI and OSA starch, preventing the shrinkage of OSA starch during spray drying [ 20]. In addition, almost no probiotic bacteria were visible on the surface of all spray-dried microcapsules, suggesting that the probiotic bacteria were embedded in the coacervate network.2.4.Probiotic Viability, Water Content and Water Activity of Spray-Dried Microcapsules The viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus in different microcapsules after spray drying is shown in Table 1.The viability of microencapsulated probiotic bacteria was 91.32±1.87% and 70.75 ±2.05% in WPI microcapsules and OSA-starch microcapsules, respectively.The low viability of probiotics in OSA-starch microcapsules after spray drying was also reported by Cruz-Ben ítez et al.
[ 19], and could be attributed to the poor solubility and poor ﬁlm-forming property of OSA starch, resulting in uneven ﬁlm formation at the beginning of the drying process and shrunken and wrinkled surfaces of the spray-dried microcapsules [19,20].

WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules exhibited a signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) higher viability (95.94 ±1.64%) than either WPI microcapsules or OSA-starch microcapsules, indicating that the combination of WPI and OSA starch would enhance the protective effect for probiotics during the process of spray drying. The high viability of probiotic bacteria in the spray-dried WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules produced here may also be due to the smooth surfaces and the compact structures of the microcapsules [ 1,40].In addition, the hydroxyl groups of OSA starch could form hydrogen bonds with the cell membrane of probiotics, effectively reducing heat damage and protecting the cell membrane from degen- eration during spray drying [ 9].
Similarly, signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) higher probiotic viability after spray drying was also found in soy-protein-isolate–peach-gum-polysaccharide, soy- protein-isolate–pectin, WPI– Momordica charantia -polysaccharide microcapsules than that in protein/polysaccharide-only microcapsules and free bacteria [ 9,10,41]. On the other hand, decreased encapsulation viability was reported when shellac was incorporated into WPI-based microcapsules, which could be attributed to the excessive hydrophobicity of shellac (the contact angle of shellac powder of 152.3◦) [13,42].As also shown in Table 1, the water content of all probiotic microcapsules was not more than 7%, which is in line with the standard acceptance values for spray-dried products [ 13].The water content of the WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules was similar to that of the WPI microcapsules, but lower than that of the OSA-starch microcapsules.
Similar results would also be reported that the water content of shellac microcapsules was signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.005) higher than that of WPI–shellac microcapsules and WPI microcapsules due to the low drying rate of shellac microcapsules, despite the strong hydrophobicity of shellac [ 13]. The Molecules 2023 ,28, 5732 7 of 14 awvalues were consistent with the water content, and a higher a w(0.247 ±0.004) was found in the OSA starch microcapsules than in the others.2.5.Viability of Microencapsulated Probiotics under Different Conditions 2.5.1.SGI Digestion As shown in Figure 4, the initial number of free Lactobacillus acidophilus was 10.12±0.18 log CFU/mL, which decreased dramatically after SGI digestion, with viability of 4.75 ±0.32 and 2.47 ±0.19 log CFU/mL after digestion in SGF and SIF, respectively.After microen- capsulation, the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus after SGI digestion was signiﬁcantly (p< 0.05 ) improved.
Among all the microcapsules, the WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules showed the highest viability (9.16 ±0.15 log CFU/g) after SGI digestion. Molecules 2023 , 28, 5732 7 of 14 As also shown in Table 1, the water content of all probiotic microcapsules was not more than 7%, which is in line with the standard acceptance values for spray-dried prod- ucts [13].The water content of the WPI-OSA-st arch microcapsules was similar to that of the WPI microcapsules, but lower than that of the OSA-starch microcapsules.Similar re-sults would also be reported that the water content of shellac microcapsules was signi ﬁ- cantly ( p < 0.005) higher than that of WPI–shellac microcapsules and WPI microcapsules due to the low drying rate of shellac microcap sules, despite the strong hydrophobicity of shellac [13].The a w values were consistent with the water content, and a higher a w (0.247 ± 0.004) was found in the OSA starch microcapsules than in the others.2.5.

SGI Digestion As shown in Figure 4, the initial number of free Lactobacillus acidophilus was 10.12 ± 0.18 log CFU/mL, which decreased dramatically after SGI digestion, with viability of 4.75 ± 0.32 and 2.47 ± 0.19 log CFU/mL after digestion in SGF and SIF, respectively.After mi-croencapsulation, the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus after SGI digestion was signi ﬁ- cantly ( p < 0.05) improved.Among all the microcapsules, the WPI-OSA-starch microcap- sules showed the highest viability (9.16 ± 0.15 log CFU/g) after SGI digestion.Figure 4.Viability of free and microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus during simulated gastric (0–120 min) and intestinal (120–360 min) digestion.
The signi ﬁcant ( p < 0.05) increased viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus in WPI-OSA- starch microcapsules during SGI digestion could be mainly a ttributed to the smooth sur- face and the compact structure of the microcapsules, as well as the relatively high hydro-phobicity of OSA starch, which were bene ﬁcial in reducing the hygroscopicity, we ttability and solubility of the microcapsules and maintaining the integrity of the microcapsules during SGI digestion, thereby preventing the di ﬀusion of hydrogen ions (H +), digestive enzymes, bile salts, etc., into the microcapsules [1,43,44]. In addition, the minimal damage to the probiotic bacteria in WPI-OSA microcapsules during spray drying, the ability of WPI to create a bu ﬀered microenvironment around prob iotics and the resistance of OSA starch to digestion may also contribute to the improved viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus during SGI digestion after microencapsulation [9,18,44].
Similarly, signi ﬁcantly ( p < 0.05) higher probiotic viability after SGI digestion was also found in soy-protein-isolate–peach-gum- polysaccharide, soy-protein-isolate–pectin, sodium-caseinate–gum-gha tti and sodium-caseinate–gum-arabic-based microcapsules than that in protein/polysaccharide-only microcapsules and free bacteria [9,10,45]. How- ever, sodium caseinate–maltodextrin and sodi um caseinate–pullulan microcapsules were Figure 4.Viability of free and microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus during simulated gastric (0–120 min) and intestinal (120–360 min) digestion.
The signiﬁcant ( p< 0.05) increased viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus in WPI-OSA- starch microcapsules during SGI digestion could be mainly attributed to the smooth surface and the compact structure of the microcapsules, as well as the relatively high hydrophobic- ity of OSA starch, which were beneﬁcial in reducing the hygroscopicity, wettability and solubility of the microcapsules and maintaining the integrity of the microcapsules during SGI digestion, thereby preventing the diffusion of hydrogen ions (H+), digestive enzymes, bile salts, etc., into the microcapsules [ 1,43,44]. In addition, the minimal damage to the probiotic bacteria in WPI-OSA microcapsules during spray drying, the ability of WPI to create a buffered microenvironment around probiotics and the resistance of OSA starch to digestion may also contribute to the improved viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus during SGI digestion after microencapsulation [9,18,44].
Similarly, signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) higher probiotic viability after SGI digestion was also found in soy-protein-isolate–peach-gum-polysaccharide, soy-protein-isolate–pectin, sodium-caseinate–gum-ghatti and sodium-caseinate–gum-arabic-based microcapsules than that in protein/polysaccharide-only microcapsules and free bacteria [ 9,10,45]. However, sodium caseinate–maltodextrin and sodium caseinate–pullulan microcapsules were unable to protect bacterial bacteria in SGF due to the extreme solubility of maltodextrin and pullulan in aqueous media, resulting in rapid dissolution of the microparticles [45].2.5.2.Heat Treatment The inﬂuences of heat treatments on the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus are shown in Figure 5.The viability of free Lactobacillus acidophilus rapidly decreased from 10.07±0.13 log CFU/mL to 2.86 ±0.18 and 3.08 ±0.23 log CFU/mL after heat treatment of 65◦C/30 min and 75◦C/10 min, respectively.
After microencapsulation, the thermal Molecules 2023 ,28, 5732 8 of 14 stability of Lactobacillus acidophilus was signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) improved. The viability of mi- croencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus in WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules was found to be 8.07±0.25 log CFU/g and 8.52 ±0.19 log CFU/g after thermal treatment of 65◦C/30 min and 75◦C/10 min, respectively, signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) higher than that in WPI microcap- sules and OSA-starch microcapsules.The reason for this could be mainly attributed to the improved sealing properties of the microcapsules due to their compact structure and smooth surface, which slows down the heat diffusion.Molecules 2023 , 28, 5732 8 of 14 unable to protect bacterial bacteria in SGF du e to the extreme solubility of maltodextrin and pullulan in aqueous media, resulting in rapid dissolution of the microparticles [45].2.5.2.Heat Treatment The in ﬂuences of heat treatments on the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus are shown in Figure 5.
The viability of free Lactobacillus acidophilus rapidly decreased from 10.07 ± 0.13 log CFU/mL to 2.86 ± 0.18 and 3.08 ± 0.23 log CFU/mL after heat treatment of 65 °C/30 min and 75 °C/10 min, respectively. After mi croencapsulation, the thermal stability of Lac- tobacillus acidophilus was signi ﬁcantly ( p < 0.05) improved.The viability of microencapsu- lated Lactobacillus acidophilus in WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules was found to be 8.07 ± 0.25 log CFU/g and 8.52 ± 0.19 log CFU/g after thermal treatment of 65 °C/30 min and 75 °C/10 min, respectively, signi ﬁcantly ( p < 0.05) higher than that in WPI microcapsules and OSA- starch microcapsules.The reason for this could be mainly a ttributed to the improved seal- ing properties of the microcapsules due to their compact structure and smooth surface, which slows down the heat di ﬀusion.Figure 5.Viability of free and microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus after thermal treatment of (a) 65 °C/30 min and ( b) 75 °C/10 min.
Signi ﬁcant diﬀerences ( p < 0.05) are indicated by di ﬀerent lowercase le tters. Similar results were also reported previously—the viability loss of probiotic bacteria in soy-protein-isolate–pectin microcapsules was only 2.55 log CFU/g, which was lower than that in SPI microcapsules (3.1 log CFU/g) after thermal treatment (75 °C/10 min) [9].However, as compared to soy-protein-isolate microcapsules, the combination of peach gum polysaccharide with soy-protein isolate reduced the viability of probiotic bacteria during the heat treatment due to the good solubility of peach-gum polysaccharide in aqueous solution, which accelerated the dissolution of the microc apsules [10].These results suggest that the physicochemical properties of the polysaccharide are very important with respect to improv-ing the structural compactness and thermal stability of the microcapsules.2.5.3.
Storage As shown in Figure 6, the stability of the di ﬀerent microcapsules containing probiot- ics was evaluated during storage at temperatures of 4 °C and 25 °C. At 4 °C, the viability of free bacteria was decreased from 10.12 ± 0.15 log CFU/mL to 5.96 ± 0.27, 3.58 ± 0.24 and 1.17 ± 0.36 log CFU/mL, after storage for 4 w eeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively.At 25 °C, no free Lactobacillus acidophilus survived after 10 weeks of storage.The storage sta- bility of Lactobacillus acidophilus was signi ﬁcantly ( p < 0.05) improved by encapsulation, especially in WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules.Bacterial vitality was maintained at 9.22 ± Figure 5.Viability of free and microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus after thermal treatment of (a) 65◦C/30 min and ( b) 75◦C/10 min.Signiﬁcant differences ( p< 0.05) are indicated by different lowercase letters.
Similar results were also reported previously—the viability loss of probiotic bacteria in soy-protein-isolate–pectin microcapsules was only 2.55 log CFU/g, which was lower than that in SPI microcapsules (3.1 log CFU/g) after thermal treatment (75◦C/10 min) [ 9]. However, as compared to soy-protein-isolate microcapsules, the combination of peach gum polysaccharide with soy-protein isolate reduced the viability of probiotic bacteria during the heat treatment due to the good solubility of peach-gum polysaccharide in aqueous solution, which accelerated the dissolution of the microcapsules [ 10].These results suggest that the physicochemical properties of the polysaccharide are very important with respect to improving the structural compactness and thermal stability of the microcapsules.2.5.3.Storage As shown in Figure 6, the stability of the different microcapsules containing probiotics was evaluated during storage at temperatures of 4◦C and 25◦C.
At 4◦C, the viability of free bacteria was decreased from 10.12 ±0.15 log CFU/mL to 5.96 ±0.27, 3.58 ±0.24 and 1.17±0.36 log CFU/mL, after storage for 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively. At 25◦C, no free Lactobacillus acidophilus survived after 10 weeks of storage.The storage stability of Lactobacillus acidophilus was signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) improved by encapsula- tion, especially in WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules.Bacterial vitality was maintained at 9.22±0.31 and 6.25 ±0.36 log CFU/g after 12 weeks of storage at 4◦C and 25◦C, respec- tively.Thus, it can be concluded that WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules can effectively protect Lactobacillus acidophilus during storage, mainly due to the smoother surface and the more compact structure of the microcapsules, as well as the relatively high hydrophobicity of OSA starch, which retards the diffusion of oxygen, moisture and other substances into the microcapsules during storage [ 1,43].
Similarly, the signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) higher storage stability of probiotics in sodium-caseinate-gum-ghatti, sodium-caseinate–gum-arabic, soy- protein-isolate–peach-gum-polysaccharide and soy-protein-isolate–pectin microcapsules Molecules 2023 ,28, 5732 9 of 14 than those in protein/polysaccharide-only microcapsules and free bacteria has also been reported [9,10,45]. Molecules 2023 , 28, 5732 9 of 14 0.31 and 6.25 ± 0.36 log CFU/g after 12 weeks of storage at 4 °C and 25 °C, respectively.Thus, it can be concluded that WPI-OSA-starch microcapsules can e ﬀectively protect Lac- tobacillus acidophilus during storage, mainly due to the smoother surface and the more compact structure of the microcapsules, as well as the relatively hi gh hydrophobicity of OSA starch, which retards the di ﬀusion of oxygen, moisture and other substances into the microcapsules during storage [1,43].
Similarly, the signi ﬁcantly ( p < 0.05) higher storage stability of probiotics in sodium-caseinate-gum-gha tti, sodium-caseinate–gum-arabic, soy-protein-isolate–peach-gum- polysaccharide and soy-protei n-isolate–pectin microcap- sules than those in protein/polysaccharide-on ly microcapsules and free bacteria has also been reported [9,10,45].

OSA, pepsin (P7012), pancreatin (P7545), am yloglucosidase (A7095), porcine-bile extract (B8613) and rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RBITC ) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).Other analytical pure chem ical reagents were obtained from Cologne Chemical Co.(Chengdu, China).3.2.Synthesis of OSA Starch OSA starch was synthesised following a previously reported process [46].Brie ﬂy, 100 g of rice starch was mixed with 400 mL of distilled water.After adjusting the pH of the mixture to 8.5 with 1 M sodium hydroxide (N aOH) solution, 3 g of OSA was slowly added while keeping the pH at 8.5.After 6 h of reaction at 25 °C, the pH was lowered to 7.0 with 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution (1 M).The precipitate obtained via centrifugation was washed three times with distilled water an d then once with acetone.The OSA starch obtained was dried to the initial moisture content of starch, ground to powder and then passed through a 100-mesh sieve.Figure 6.

Brieﬂy, 100 g of rice starch was mixed with 400 mL of distilled water. After adjusting the pH of the mixture to 8.5 with 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, 3 g of OSA was slowly added while keeping the pH at 8.5.After 6 h of reaction at 25◦C, the pH was lowered to 7.0 with 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution (1 M).The precipitate obtained via centrifugation was washed three times with distilled water and then once with acetone.The OSA starch obtained was dried to the initial moisture content of starch, ground to powder and then passed through a 100-mesh sieve.3.3.Complex Coacervation Formation and Characterisation 3.3.1.Preparation of the WPI-OSA-Starch Solution The preparation of WPI solution (1%, w/v) was performed by mixing the powder of WPI with aqua destillata and slowly stirring until complete hydration was achieved.The OSA-starch solution (1%, w/v) was prepared by mixing the powder of OSA starch with aqua destillata, followed by gelatinisation at 95◦C for 20 min.
As the retrogradation usually occurred in gelatinised starch, the fresh OSA starch solution had to be prepared for each experiment and used immediately after preparation. Molecules 2023 ,28, 5732 10 of 14 3.3.2.Turbidity Measurement Turbidity measurements were performed at different ratios (WPI:OSA starch of 0:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and 1:0) with a pH range of 2.0–6.5 using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (SDPTOP UV-2400, Shanghai, China) at 600 nm.In order to adapt the microencapsulation and keep the turbidity values in an appropriate range, measurements were made at a relatively high concentration (total biopolymer concentration of 0.2%, w/v), using the glass cells with an optical path of 0.5 cm [ 47].The optimum pH (pHopt) was deﬁned as the pH at which maximum turbidity was achieved [48].3.3.3.
Zeta Potential Analysis The zeta potential of the solution of WPI, OSA starch and the mixture of them at different ratios (WPI:OSA starch of 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1) was determined as a function of pH (3.0–6.5, adjusted with an HCl solution) using a zetasizer (Nano-ZS, Malvern Instruments, Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). The pH at which the zeta potential reaches 0 was deﬁned to be the isoelectric point (IEP) [48].3.3.4.Yield Measurement of Complex Coacervates In order to study the adaptability of the process in the ﬁeld of microencapsulation, the yields of WPI-OSA-starch-complex coacervates with different ratios (WPI:OSA starch of 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1) and different total polymer concentrations (1% and 5%, w/v) were determined following the approach described by Carpentier et al.[ 48] and Chen et al.[ 47].Brieﬂy, the pH of each mixed solution of WPI-OSA starch was adjusted to its pHopt.
When phase separation was evident, the liquid complex coacervates were collected via centrifugation (9000 ×g, 20 min) and then dehydrated at 105◦C to constant mass. The yield of each complex coacervate was calculated according to Equation (1): Yield (%) = W c/W t×100 (1) In this equation, W cis the dry weight of the complex coacervates (g) and W tis the sum of the dry weight of WPI and OSA starch used for the complex coacervation (g).3.4.Microencapsulation of Probiotic Bacteria Glycerol-preserved Lactobacillus acidophilus was incubated in an MRS culture medium at 37◦C for 24 h to prepare Lactobacillus acidophilus inoculum, which was then transferred to MRS culture medium and incubated for a further 24 h.The bacterial suspension was centrifuged (6000 ×g/5 min) and the pellet was washed twice and redispersed in sterile normal saline solution to give a ﬁnal concentration of approximately 1010CFU/mL.
Microcapsules were prepared as follows: (1) prepare WPI, OSA starch and WPI- OSA-starch-mixed solution, the ratio and the total concentration were determined in Section 2.3; (2) keep the solution at 4◦C for 12 h to ensure adequate hydration; (2) add probiotic bacteria solution to the above solutions to about 1010CFU/g materials and stir continuously for 30 min; (3) adjust the pH to the pHopt determined in Section 2.3 and keep the above solutions at 4◦C for 12 h to ensure the completion of the complex coacervation; (4) dehydrate the complex coacervates containing the probiotic bacteria using a spray dryer (EYELA SD-1000, Tokyo Rikakikai, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with the following parameters: inlet/outlet temperature 120◦C/70◦C; gas ﬂow rate 30 m3/h. 3.5.Characterisation of the Microcapsules 3.5.1.FTIR Spectroscopy The FTIR spectrum of the different microcapsules containing probiotics was measured using an FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet iS10, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Ltd., Waltham, MA, USA).
Brieﬂy, 2 mg of microcapsule powder and 98 mg of KBr were blended and ground to a ﬁne powder using an agate mortar. The ground powder was then pressed into transparent Molecules 2023 ,28, 5732 11 of 14 ﬂakes using a tablet press.The range of the wave number for measurement was set to 400–4000 cm−1.The spectral data were obtained via 32 scans with a resolution of 1 cm−1.3.5.2.Fluorescence Microscopy Lactobacillus acidophilus were labelled with RBITC according to the approach reported by Peñalva et al.[ 23].Different microcapsules containing RBITC-labelled bacteria were prepared as described in Section 2.4 and analysed via an inverted ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon TS100, Tokyo, Japan).3.5.3.Microstructure Observation A scanning electron microscope (SEM) (SU8010, Hitachi Science Systems, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure the microstructure of the different microcapsules contain- ing probiotics.After, they were placed on the adhesive carbon discs and coated with a gold layer.
Images of each sample were obtained at 10.0 kV accelerating potential and 20,000 ×magniﬁcation. 3.5.4.Water Content and Water Activity The water content of the different microcapsules containing probiotics was measured by removing the water at 105◦C to constant mass.The water-activity meter (LabMas-terav., Lachen, Switzerland) was used to analyse the water activity (a w) of different microcapsules containing probiotics at 25◦C.3.6.Determination of Microencapsulation Viability Following the approach reported by Zhao et al.[ 49], microcapsules (dry weight) were dispersed in sterile normal saline solution at a ratio of 1:99 ( w:v), kept at 37◦C for 60 min and then vortexed to homo-dispersion.The suspension was then serially diluted and counted via the standard plate count (SPC) method using MRS agar.Incubation of the plates was performed at 37◦C for 2 days.3.7.Viability under Different Treatments 3.7.1.
SGI Digestion The viability of free and microencapsulated probiotic bacteria after SGI digestion was determined following the approach described by Mao et al. [ 50], with some modiﬁcations.The sterilised sodium chloride (NaCl) solution (0.2%, w/v, pH 2.0) containing pepsin (0.3%, w/v) was prepared and used as the simulated gastric ﬂuid (SGF).The NaCl solution (0.2%, w/v, pH 8.0) containing pancreatin (0.1%, w/v) and bile salts (0.3%, w/v) was prepared and used as the simulated intestinal ﬂuid (SIF).For SGI digestion, microcapsules (0.1 g) or free (0.1 mL) probiotic bacteria were added to 9.9 mL SGF and kept at 37◦C for 120 min.At 60 and 120 min, 0.1 mL of SGF was taken from each sample, serially diluted and counted via the SPC method.After simulated gastric digestion, the rest of SGF was moved to the SIF and the probiotic bacteria were counted at 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min as previously described.3.7.2.
Thermal Treatment To measure the thermal stability, microcapsules (1 g) or free (1 mL) probiotic bacteria were mixed with 9 mL sterile normal saline solution, and then incubated in a thermostat water bath (65◦C/30 min or 75◦C/10 min) followed by cooling with ice. The number of viable bacteria after thermal treatment was then determined.3.7.3.Storage To determine the storage stability, microcapsules (1 g) or free (1 mL) probiotic bac- teria were preserved in sealed tubes at 4◦C/25◦C for 12 weeks.Each week, 0.1 mL of free bacteria or 0.1 g of microcapsules were taken from each sample and counted as previously described.Molecules 2023 ,28, 5732 12 of 14 3.8.Statistical Analysis Each measurement was performed three times and the data were recorded as the mean±standard deviation.Statistical differences between samples were analysed using SPSS software, with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s test ( p< 0.05).4.
Conclusions In this study, complex coacervates of WPI and OSA starch were prepared for mi- croencapsulation of Lactobacillus acidophilus . The optimum mixing ratio and pH for the preparation of the WPI-OSA-starch-complex coacervate were found to be 2:1 and 4.0, re- spectively.The occurrence of an electrostatic interaction between WPI and OSA starch in microcapsules was conﬁrmed via FTIR.The spray-dried WPI-OSA starch microcapsules exhibited more compact structures and smoother surfaces than WPI-OSA starch-only micro- capsules.Microencapsulation via the complex coacervation of WPI-OSA starch was found to be effective in improving the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus during spray drying, SGI digestion, thermal treatment and long-term storage.Taken together, these results demonstrate that WPI-OSA-starch-complex coacervates are promising wall materials for probiotic encapsulation.Author Contributions: Conceptualisation, Q.L., Q.B.and Y.Y.(Yongjun Yuan); methodology, Q.L.
