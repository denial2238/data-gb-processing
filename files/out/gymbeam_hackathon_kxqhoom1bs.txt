Review Effects of Food-Based Approaches on Vitamin A Status of Women and Children: A Systematic Review Joyce Nankumbi1, Frederick Grant2, Lindiwe Sibeko1, Evelyn Mercado3, Kristina O ’Neil1, Lorraine S.Cordeiro1,* 1Department of Nutrition, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, United States;2International Potato Center, Kampala, Uganda;3Department of Psychology and Brain Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, United States ABSTRACT Vitamin A de ﬁciency (VAD) increases risk for morbidity and mortality.Food-based approaches offer one strategy to improve vitamin A status.This systematic review assessed evidence of the effects of food-based approaches on the vitamin A status of women and childrenunder 5 y.VAD was de ﬁned as clinical ocular symptoms, such as loss of vision, and/or retinol plasma or serum concentration <0.70 μmol/L.
Searches on food-based approaches to improve vitamin A status were conducted for the period 2011 –2022 on PubMed, CINHAL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using PRISMA guidelines. English-language publications were included.Case studies, unpublished disserta- tions, and non-peer-reviewed studies were excluded.This review comprises 24 of 27,322 identi ﬁed studies; 23 included studies focused on provitamin A carotenoids.There were 17,214 participants across the 24 studies with sample sizes ranging from 8 to 3571 individuals.Intervention studies spanned from 3 wk to 2 y.Fifteen (63%) studies were randomized control trials, 7 were cross-sectional, and 2 were longitudinal studies.Most studies ( N¼21) used biochemical measurements, for example, serum retinol, to assess vitamin A status; other studies used clinical symptoms (for example, xerophtalmia) or dietary intake.
Thirteen (54%) studies reported a statistically signi ﬁcant effect of food-based interventions ( N¼8) or an association of diet ( N¼5) on vitamin A status. This systematic review indicated that some food-based interventions improved vitamin A status, thus offering a safe and effective delivery mechanism for vitamin A.There appeared to be signi ﬁcant association between vitamin A status and consumption of foods with high concentrations of preformed vitamin A and pro- vitamin A carotenoids.Differences across studies in regard to the period of evaluation, food approaches used, and statistical power mayexplain the lack of effectiveness of food-based approaches on vitamin A status in some studies.
Keywords : vitamin A, women, children, food-based approaches, vitamin A de ﬁciency Statement of Signi ﬁcance A plethora of research on the effectiveness of vitamin A interventions exists; however, there is limited evidence on associations between dietary intake and vitamin A status, as well as the effectiveness of food-based interventions on vitamin A status. This systematic review ﬁlls a critical gap in the literature given that there is no recent review that documents and evaluates the effectiveness of the various food-based ap- proaches in improving vitamin A status among women and children under 5 y.

Vitamin A de ﬁciency is de ﬁned as clinical ocular symptoms of vitamin A de ﬁciency, such as night blindness to permanent loss of vision, and/or retinol plasma or serum con-centration <0.70 μmol/L [ 2]. Globally, over 127 million children, inclusive of more than one-third of children in sub-Saharan Africa, are affected by VAD [3,4].An estimated 3 million children have clinical manifesta- tions of xeropthalmia; a third of these cases were in Africa [ 5].Between 1995 and 2005, an estimated 19 million pregnantwomen were affected by VAD [ 2,5].VAD can occur in in- dividuals of any age, with higher susceptibility among womenand children [ 2,6].Women are particularly vulnerable to VAD during pregnancy and lactation, evidenced by reports of nightblindness and low vitamin A levels in breast milk [ 7].VAD presents a disabling and potentially fatal public health problemfor children under 6 y of age [ 8,9] with a high prevalence of blindness in children under 3 y [ 5].
In addition to the clinical manifestations of xeropthalmia and risk of irreversible blindness, nonspeci ﬁc symptoms include increased morbidity and mortality, poor reproductive health,increased risk of anemia, and delayed growth and development[2]. However, the actual number of subclinical de ﬁciencies based on the prevalence of low serum retinol levels remainsuncertain because of the confounding and poorly quanti ﬁed role of infections [ 2].Furthermore, many nonspeci ﬁc adverse effects of VAD may also be caused by other nutrient de ﬁciencies including de ﬁciencies in iron, zinc, and the B-vitamins [ 10], making it dif ﬁcult to attribute nonocular symptoms to VAD alone in the absence of biochemical measurements [ 11,12].
Preformed vitamin A is found in ﬁsh, organ meats (for example, liver), eggs, and dairy products, whereas provitamin Acarotenoids (mainly ß-carotene) can be found in plant products such as dark leafy greens, and red, orange, and yellow fruits andvegetables like sweet potatoes, pumpkins, carrots and mangos.There is a high ef ﬁciency of metabolization, absorption, and storage of preformed vitamin A. In contrast, provitamin A ca-rotenoids, like ß-carotene, have to be converted into active vitamin A, retinol, and other retinoids in the human body and areless bioavailable.VAD prevention efforts primarily occurthrough vitamin A intervention approaches, including direct increase in vitamin A intake through consumption of foods with naturally high concentrations of preformed vitamin A or provi-tamin A, vitamin A (or ß-carotene) supplements, food bio- fortiﬁcation, and indirect public health measures to control disease frequency [ 13,14].
Bioforti ﬁcation refers to the process of improving the nutrient quality of food through plant breeding,biotechnology, or agronomic initiatives [ 15]. Efforts promoting homestead food production of both bioforti ﬁed and nonforti ﬁ ed crops can directly reduce the prevalence of vitamin A de ﬁciency by increasing intake of food sources with high concentrations ofpreformed vitamin A and provitamin A [ 16].Adequate intake offruits and vegetables that are rich in provitamin A is a sustainable alternative to the provision of vitamin A supplements or forti ﬁed food [ 17].Although a plethora of research on the effectiveness of vitamin A interventions exists, there is limited evidence on theeffectiveness of food-based interventions such as increasing di- etary intake of foods with high concentrations of preformed or provitamin A, traditional food forti ﬁcation, or food bio- fortiﬁcation on vitamin A status.
Food-based interventions offer an opportunity for effective and catalytic programming to ach-ieve global development targets, eradicate malnutrition, andimprove health outcomes at scale [ 18–20]. Considerable efforts have been made in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) topromote vitamin A intake through increased production andconsumption of affordable provitamin A plant sources, mainlycontaining ß-carotene and ß-cryptoxanthin [ 21].Food-based approaches, including supplementation, increased dietary di- versity, and bioforti ﬁcation, have been identi ﬁed as a key strategy in improving multi-micronutrient de ﬁciencies [ 22].This systematic review documents the scienti ﬁc evidence on the effectiveness of food-based approaches on addressing VAD orimproving the vitamin A status of women and children under 5 y.This review ﬁlls a critical gap in the literature base given that there is no recent review on the effectiveness of food-based ap-proaches in combating VAD.
Methods The authors followed the systematic review process reported by Crowther et al. [ 23] and adhered to the PRISMA guidelines [24].Systematic searches and extractions were used to map the nutrition, agriculture, and public health literature and identifykey concepts and primary research.A literature search wasconducted using 4 large databases, including PubMed, CINHAL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.The search strategy was developed in consultation with the University of MassachusettsAmherst Health Science librarian until we achieved saturation inthe results.Two authors, JN and KO, independently abstracted all studies in this review using a search strategy of text words, index,truncation, and Boolean operators [ 25].
The framework employed the following search terms in PubMed, CHNHAL, Webof Science, and Google Scholar: ( “Food-based approach* ”OR “strateg* ”OR“program* ”OR“intervention* ”OR“trial”OR experiment* ”) AND ( “vitamin A status ”OR ‘’vitamin A deﬁcienc* ”) AND ( “women ”OR“young child* ”OR“infant* ”OR “toddler* ”). The * symbol serves as a wildcat that stands in for any letters to ﬁnish the word.Additional searches were con- ducted manually by looking at citations of full-text reviews, thusserving as a reference list search (that is, backward referencesearch) and cited reference search (that is, forward referencesearch).All searches were conducted and logged from May 2021to March 2022.Eligibility and exclusion criteria Studies with publication dates between 2011 and 2022 were included in this empirical study.This time period re ﬂects the last decade during which no systematic reviews were found on thistopic.We included primary research studies that were 1)J.Nankumbi et al.
Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1436 –1452 1437 English-language publications in peer-reviewed journals; 2) focused on interventions or programs of food-based approachesaimed at improving vitamin A status or VAD of women andchildren under the age of 5 y; and 3) cross-sectional studies that explored the association between diet and vitamin A status ofwomen and children. Studies were excluded if they were single case studies, unpublished theses or dissertations, not published in peer-reviewed journals, or not relevant to the objective of thisreview.We considered including articles in languages other thanEnglish but omitted these from this systematic review due tolimited resources for translation of documents.Study selection Detailed information about the study selection process is provided in the PRISMA ﬂow diagram ( Figure 1 ).Quality assessment Each of the studies under review was independently assessed for quality by 2 authors, and reassessed by a third author.
The team assessed risk of bias in each of the studies following rec- ommendations of the Agency for Healthcare Research andQuality which provided evidence-based guidelines for assessingcomparative effectiveness and risk of bias reviews of individualstudies [ 26]. Recommendations applicable to this reviewincluded using a tool that is speci ﬁc to the study design being evaluated, transparency in how assessments were made, andavoiding the presentation of risk of bias assessment as a nu-merical score.For cross-sectional studies, we used the AXIS toolas described by Downes et al.[ 27].Developed in 2016, AXIS is a critical appraisal tool that addresses study design, reporting quality, and risk of bias in cross-sectional studies [ 27–29].
The AXIS tool includes 20 items that focus on study quality includingjustiﬁcation of the sample, representativeness of the sample, use of validated measures, description of statistical methods, dis-cussion of no response bias, funding statement, and con ﬂict of interest disclosures [ 27]. For intervention studies, we deter- mined risk of bias in randomized control trials using a tool thatassessed study quality including trial design, conduct, andreporting [ 30].For each domain, a series of questions elicited information about features of the trial that could result in risk ofbias [ 31].Data extraction The research team used a standard form to extract informa- tion from each article on authors, year of publication, studydesign, study objective, sample size, recruitment method(s),sample eligibility criteria, geographical location, measures ofvitamin A status and/or VAD, type of food-based approach, FIGURE 1.

After all titlesand abstracts were examined, 26,780 studies did not meet theinclusion criteria. An additional 115 studies were excludedbecause of duplication and 5 were excluded because they weresolely abstracts.Consequently, a total of 422 studies werescreened.Of these, 2323 studies were excluded due to beingirrelevant to the main subject ( n¼313), single case reports ( n¼ 2), duplication ( n¼2), not English-language articles ( n¼4), and because the same study was published in 2 different journals ( n¼ 2) (Figure 1 ).Ninety-nine full-text articles were assessed further and of these, 71 records were excluded for not pertaining to thereview of interest.Twenty-eight full-text articles were consid-ered for inclusion and after excluding 4 articles, 24 empiricalstudies were included for the ﬁnal systematic review ( Figure 1 ).General characteristics and main methodological properties of the 24 studies included in this systematic review are describedinTable 1 .
Twenty-three studies focused on plant-based foods as sources of provitamin A/beta carotene and one study examinedmicronutrient-forti ﬁed milk, a source of preformed vitamin A. Interventions featured in this review spanned from 3 wk to 2 y.One study was conducted in each of the following countries: Uganda [ 32], Tanzania [ 33], Cameroon [ 34], Mozambique [ 35], Mexico [ 36], Philippines [ 37], Indonesia [ 38] and Thailand [39].Two studies were conducted in each of the following countries: Kenya [ 40,41] Nigeria [ 42,43], Zambia [ 44,45], India [46,47], and United States [ 48,49].Three studies were con- ducted in Bangladesh [ 50–52] and 3 studies were conducted in Brazil [ 53–55].Participant characteristics In total, there were 17,214 participants across the 24 studies in the ﬁnal analytical sample.The number of participants ranged from 8 [ 49] to 3571 [ 47].Four studies recruited less than 100 participants with a range from 8 to 70 participants [ 39,48,49, 56].
All other studies ( N¼20) recruited more than 100 partic- ipants [ 32–35,37,38,40–47,50–55]. Two studies recruited par- ticipants that were well-nourished with adequate vitamin Aintake [ 48,49], whereas 9 studies reported that the participants had mild to moderate or marginal VAD [ 32,37,39,42–45,50,51].Three studies indicated lower baseline vitamin A breast milk concentrations [ 34,44,51].Eight studies recruited only women [ 33,39,40,48–51,53], 8 studies included only children [ 37,41,42,45–47,54,57], and 8 studies included both women and children [ 32,34,35, 38,43,44, 52,55].Women included in the studies were in the reproductiveage group ranging from 15 to 49 y, with a mean of 34.0 /C60.5 y.Fourteen studies included children [ 32,34,35,37,38,41–43, 45–47,52,54,55,57], most ( n¼12) of which included children /C2060 mo [ 32,34,35,37,38,42,43,46,47,52,54,55].The lowest and highest reported mean ages for children were 20.8 /C60.5 mo and 8.9/C62.4 y, respectively.
Risk of bias in individual studies Eligible studies were assessed for risk of bias ( Table 2 ). Most studies explicitly stated the study objective as food-based ap-proaches and vitamin A status or VAD; the population of interest;and the exposure and outcome of the study [ 32,34,37,39,40,42, 44,45,48–51,54,57].In the process of assessment, studies were identi ﬁed as having a risk for sampling bias if they had loss to follow-up [ 32,39–41].We noted 3 studies where measuring the exposure or the outcome was based on participant recall whichincreases bias [ 43,44,51].Studies with stringent inclusion criteria or greater than 15% loss to follow-up were considered to have a higher risk of sampling bias [ 32,37,39,40,56].One study explicitly reported a high risk of measurement bias as one of itslimitations [ 46].Methodological features of the studies All studies reviewed were empirical and quantitative.
Of the 24 studies, 14 studies (58.3%) were experimental studies [ 32,35, 37,39–42,44,45,48–51,56]. Ten of the experimental studies were randomized control trials with 2 arms or groups [ 32,35, 39–44,51,56]; 2 studies had 3 arms [ 41,44] and 2 studies had 4 arms [ 50,51].Two randomized crossover trials [ 48,49], with a minimum of 2 wk between food-based treatments, and one pre- and post-evaluation study were also included [ 38].Ten studies (41.7%) were nonexperimental [ 33,34,38,43,46,47,52–55], with one study being a prospective cohort study [ 53] and one with a longitudinal design that had an intended intervention[33].The remaining were cross-sectional studies [ 34,38,43,46, 47,52,54,55].
Sampling techniques The reviewed studies employed various sampling techniques at different stages of the design including multistage clustersampling [ 34,43,45,52], cluster sampling [ 32,35,46], simple sampling at the village or household level [ 38,44,51], and simple random sampling of participants [ 37,39,51]. Other studies employed purposive sampling of participants [ 33,41,42,48,49, 53,55] or the sampling techniques were not clearly articulated in the articles [ 40,50,54,57].All 14 experimental studies employed randomization of participants to the study arms.Among thenonexperimental studies, 4 studies purposively selected womenwho met the inclusion criteria [ 37,40,47,50].In 7 studies, only children under the age of 5 y were included in the study [ 37,42, 45–47,54,57].Food-based approaches Food-based approaches identi ﬁed in this review included examination of tubers, citrus, rice, maize, fruit, oil, peanuts, and milk.
Bioforti ﬁed foods included orange- ﬂeshed sweet potatoes (600 μg) [32,35,40,50,51], provitamin A-forti ﬁed cassava (1mg ß-carotene) [ 41–43,48,49], tangerines (13 RAE/100g) [ 51], vitamin A forti ﬁed rice (6 –31μg/g) [ 39], and orange maizeJ. Nankumbi et al.

Four studies focused on the associ- ations between dietary intake of foods rich in provitamin A ca-rotenoids and vitamin A status or VAD [ 33,47,52,54]. Four intervention studies compared vitamin A supplements to food-based approaches or dietary intake of foods with high concentrations of preformed or provitamin A [ 37,44,50,51].Interventions included distribution of supplemental foods toparticipants for daily consumption [ 39,56] and plant materials, such as orange- ﬂeshed sweet potato vines [ 32,35,40].In- terventions designed as controlled experiments included pre-pared meals distributed to participants on top of their daily diets[41,42,48,49,57]; dietary intake effects on vitamin A status [ 33, 38,47,54,55]; take-home uncooked foods for consumption with the other foods/meals [ 39,51]; or vitamin A supplementationcompared to dietary intake of foods with high concentrations in provitamin A carotenoids [ 37,41,44,50, 51].
In randomized controlled trials, the intervention period ranged from 3 wk [ 51]t o2y[ 32], with 3 interventions extending beyond 12 mo [ 32,35,37]. Three experimental studies included more than one intervention and comparison arm [ 41, 50,51].Dietary intake, as an exposure variable, was assessed with either a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) [ 34,35,46,52, 53,55] or 24-h dietary recall [ 32,38,40,47,48].Vitamin A status/vitamin A de ﬁciency measurement Outcomes of interest in the reviewed studies were vitamin A status and VAD.Measurement methods for these variablesincluded high-performance liquid chromatography [ 32,35,37, 41,44,48,51–55,57], enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ 33, 34,38,40,41], or the retinol isotope dilution (RID) [ 39].

Nankumbi et al. Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1436 –1452 1447 and VAD deduced from dietary intake [ 46].Eleven of 24 studies (45.8%) reported adjusting serum retinol levels for in ﬂammation or subclinical infection [ 32,34–36,38–40,42–44,52].Effect of food-based approaches on vitamin A status of women and children A signi ﬁcant difference in vitamin A status was observed between the intervention and control groups ( P<0.05) in 8 intervention studies [ 35,37,39,40,48,49,52,57].In another 7 intervention studies, no statistically signi ﬁcant differences were observed between groups, although vitamin A levels were higher in the intervention group compared to the control group in somestudies [ 32,41,42,44,45,50,51].
Some of these studies found a statistically signi ﬁcant ( P<0.05) improvement in the vitamin A status or serum retinol levels [ 37,39,52], or improvement in TAG retinol lipoproteins [ 48], or improvement in total body vitamin A stores [ 40,57], or increase in beta ß-carotene, α-carotene, and retinyl palmitate in triacylglycerol-rich plasma concentrations[49] of the participants in the intervention groups. While an additional 2 studies reported a statistically signi ﬁcant positive association between dietary intake of foods with high concen-trations of preformed vitamin A or provitamin A and vitamin A status [ 48,52].In one study, a signi ﬁcant mean difference in retinol levels was noted in children but not among the womenstudied [ 32].Another study reported a signi ﬁcant change in retinol levels at 18 mo as opposed to the 3-mo follow-up period[37].
In 5 cross-sectional studies, dietary intake of foods with high concentrations of provitamin A carotenoids was associated withhigher serum retinol levels or other indicators or vitamin A status[38,47,53–55]. One cross-sectional study reported nonsigni ﬁ- cant associations between vitamin A intake and serum levels[34].Retinol levels were adjusted for in ﬂammation or subclini- cal infection in 12 of the 24 studies [ 32,34,38–41,43,44,50–53].Limitations of individual studies A major limitation of this review is that studies derived from the search terms comprised plant-based food approaches, withthe exception of one study on vitamin A forti ﬁed milk [ 57].In- dividual studies included in the review highlighted a number ofdesign and sampling-related limitations ( Table 2 ).Cross-sectional studies could not establish a causal relationship.Three studiesnoted an inadequate amount of time (that is, 3 –18 mo) to observe effects in intervention studies [ 37,42,56].
Four studies had low-powered designs with insuf ﬁcient sample sizes to compre- hensively examine the effects of food-based approaches on theretinol levels or vitamin A status of the populations [ 34,48,49, 56]. Three studies did not include biochemical measurements of serum retinol and instead, deduced vitamin A status from dietaryintake or ocular examination thus increasing the likelihood ofestimation error and bias associated with self-reports [ 35,46,47].Another study noted the possibility of underestimation of the outcome as a limitation considering the nutrition contribution ofbreast milk was not measured [ 46].Similarly, the lack of preci- sion in the estimation of the 600 μg capsule of vitamin A in another study may have resulted in overestimated changes in retinol levels hence reducing the power to detect an effect [ 44].
Two studies reported that additional confounding factors forvitamin A status were not measured [ 33,54], thus increasing the likelihood of overestimation of the outcome. In one study, thephysiological status of women who were breastfeeding may have impacted the assumptions used in RID calculations [ 39], hence suggesting a need to further validate the results due to issueswith accuracy related to losses through breast milk.Two studiesidenti ﬁed the inability to delineate the effect of the intervention as the sole contributor to the vitamin A status as a study limi- tation [ 32,42].Another 2 studies were conducted among adequately nourished women suggesting optimal vitamin Astatus compared to studies examining VAD among participants[48,49].Change in the initial methods of one study was docu- mented as a limitation [ 37].Discussion This systematic review examined and synthesized research on the effects of food-based approaches on vitamin A status or VADof women and children.
The studies included in this reviewfocused on women who were pregnant or lactating, and/orchildren under 5 y of age. These are critical stages of the life cyclewith increased demand for vitamin A [ 58].Vitamin A is neces- sary for cell differentiation and organ formation during preg- nancy, for tissue repair in the postpartum period [ 59,60], and during fetal growth and development [ 58].This systematic re- view assessed evidence of the effects of food-based approacheson the vitamin A status of women and children, and aimed toserve as a reference for future research and policy development.Previous reviews on vitamin A interventions have reportedinconsistent results for improvements in vitamin A status [ 60] and none reported improvement in the absorption of othermicronutrients [ 61].There is high rate of mortality among children under 5 y of age in LMIC [ 62,63].
Almost three-fourths (72%) of children aged 6–23 mo are not fed a minimally diverse diet to meet their nutrition needs resulting in a high risk of not meeting theirvitamin A requirements [ 64]. Food-based approaches provide opportunities to integrate the delivery of successfulevidence-based interventions in maternal health and childhoodprograms for early identi ﬁcation, prevention, and control of VAD.Furthermore, evaluating interventions that can enhance nutrientintakes for desired health outcomes in resource-constrained set-tings can inform national policies to reduce malnutrition andimprove health outcomes.This systematic review found that some food-based ap- proaches focusing on vitamin A had the potential to improve the vitamin A status of affected populations.
Fifty-four percent ( N¼ 13) of the studies in this review reported statistically signi ﬁcant results in interventions aimed at improving serum retinol levels[35,37,39,40,48,49,52,57] or in cross-sectional studies exam- ining associations between dietary intake and vitamin A status orserum retinol levels [ 38,47,53–55]. In one cross-sectional study, consumption of animal source foods had an advantage over darkleafy green vegetables as protective factor for vitamin A status[52].Household income and place of residence (urban compared with rural) were also signi ﬁcant variables attributable to higher serum retinol levels [ 47], suggesting that a multitude of factors inﬂuence vitamin A intake.The limitation of cross-sectional designs is that they cannot ascertain causal pathways.Howev-er, these studies still provide important information on de-terminants of intake of foods with high concentrations ofpreformed or provitamin A.J.Nankumbi et al.
Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1436 –1452 1448 When a focus on and engagement of the population of interest is central to programming, the bene ﬁts of food-based approaches are likely to reach the poorest populations, while being moresustainable and environmentally friendly [ 65]. In addition, such food-based approaches are less likely to cause toxicity comparedto high dose vitamin A supplementation programs [ 66,67].Nevertheless, there are challenges in the design and assessment of the multiple input variables that go into a comprehensivefood-based intervention [ 68].Considerations have to be made to assess the quality of studies.Examination of the variety of ap-proaches and crops used, including dietary modi ﬁcation of traditional foods, combinations of supplement and food-basedinterventions, and bioforti ﬁcation of widely consumed staple foods such as rice, maize, orange- ﬂeshed sweet potatoes, and cassava, is also needed.
Most importantly, this review presentsmixed ﬁndings and recommends more research to determine the most successful food-based approaches, including an under- standing of what length of time or dose-response is needed in a food-based intervention. Furthermore, more studies on theeffectiveness of preformed vitamin A on VAD are needed, as wellas comparative studies that examine the effect of various dietarypatterns on VAD.A key recommendation derived from this systematic review was that the need for comparative research on communities withintakes of similar staple foods or crops.Focusing on staple crops,while taking into consideration the dietary and cultural practicesof the intended communities, can optimize the intended bene ﬁts such as uptake, improvement of vitamin A status, and assessment of the potential of food-based approaches [ 69].
Of importance is the observation that some interventions resulted in other bene-ﬁts to the study communities in addition to improved levels of vitamin A [ 32,42]. These included improvements in livelihoods [32]; income generation derived from selling part of the harvest and increased intake of other micronutrients, such as iron [ 42].The latter is of particular interest to both vitamin A and ironprograms as vitamin A has a regulatory role in the expression ofgenes involved in iron metabolism, and supports the mobiliza-tion and transportation of iron [ 59].Our examination of the quality of studies or risk of bias assessment is a strength of this review.Studies that included randomization or simple random sampling were representativeof the targeted populations thus minimizing selection bias andsampling error.Although randomization can effectively captureallocation bias, it also counteracts preference effects and candecrease the potential generalizability of the study ﬁndings [ 70].
In addition to these quality issues, the inability to collectbiochemical data to establish serum retinol levels or vitamin Astatus created a greater window for estimation errors from theproxy indicators used. However, the challenges in collectingserum retinol concentration directly through high-performance liquid chromatography as recommended by the WHO is chal- lenging in resource-constrained settings.Such assays areexpensive, technically demanding, and rarely available in LMIC[71].The different approaches in estimating serum retinol levels across studies may make the comparison of study results in thisreview challenging due to inconsistencies.
Besides other assess-ment methods such as estimating a combination of transthyretin,retinol binding protein and C-reactive protein concentrations[71], clinical examination for xeropthalmia [ 72], and the esti- mation of vitamin A status from dietary intake assessment, theHelen Keller International assessment tool is considered to be an effective measure of vitamin A intake [ 73]. Comparison with a previous systematic review and limitations Our review corroborates a previous systematic review [ 74] which recommended more randomized controlled trails to assessthe effectiveness of food-based approaches on improving vitaminA status or alleviating VAD among women and children.Ran-domized trials of food-based approaches tend to be complexduring the implementation phase [ 75].
Evidence of ef ﬁcacy, the measure of the degree of success of an intervention, rather than effectiveness, the degree of success of an intervention in idealconditions, might provide a more meaningful understanding ofimprovements in vitamin A status in population-based studies[76]. Although 54% of studies in our systematic review reported signiﬁcant improvements in the vitamin A status of the partici- pants in the intervention groups, 33% did not ﬁnd this effect.The vast differences across studies in the period of evaluation acrossinterventions, food approaches used, and statistical power, mayserve as possible explanatory factors for the lack of demonstratedeffectiveness of food-based approaches on vitamin A status in these studies.Previous reviews noted a lack of statistical power as one of several methodological weaknesses in studies [ 61,74].
This is partly a consequence of the complexity of the settings inLMIC rather than a re ﬂection of the skills of the research team or the rigor of study designs. The intricacy of the chain of factors that lead from the implementation of a food-based approach program to improvedvitamin A status warrants a greater understanding of the cir-cumstances under which people participate in such interventions,the immediate effects on their diets, and interpretation of ﬁnd- ings.In addition, confounding factors such as health and envi- ronmental conditions, as well as cultural beliefs and practices, can inﬂuence each stage of food-based interventions from planning, to implementation and uptake of the intervention [ 75].A number of studies in our review considered the effects of health condi-tions, such as in ﬂammation, in the interpretation of serum retinol levels.
Insufﬁcient data limited our ability to provide a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of traditional forti ﬁcation and bio- fortiﬁcation approaches. Such a comparison is of interest due to implications related to sustainability, maintenance of traditionalfood knowledge, nutrition and food security, cost-effectiveness, stability of the forti ﬁcant and forti ﬁed food, market impact, cost, and effectiveness in reducing VAD.Conclusion This systematic review examined the literature on food-based approaches as a possible strategy in improving vitamin A statusamong pregnant or lactating women and children under 5 y.Overall, most studies presented in this review illustrated a pos- itive trend toward improving vitamin A status using food-basedapproaches, with 54% ﬁnding signi ﬁcant improvements in the intervention groups or statistically signi ﬁcant associations be- tween diet and vitamin A status.These ﬁndings suggest that food-based approaches may provide a useful public healthJ.
Nankumbi et al. Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1436 –1452 1449 strategy in addressing VAD and improving vitamin A status.The lack of statistical signi ﬁcance in some of these studies combined with mixed results on the effects of food-based approaches onvitamin A status or improvement in VAD indicates that moreresearch is needed for a robust analysis of this relationship.Further research could improve the quality of literature by a continued application of rigorous approaches to study design and extending the evaluation period of interventions to deter-mine effect.We contend that the wide variety of implementationmethods and lengths of interventions created challenges inassessing effect size.Food-based approaches command large resources and im- provements in their programmatic design have the potential tomaximize the nutritional outcomes outlined in the SustainableDevelopment Goals [ 77,78].
Further comparative research on the delivery of vitamin A to intended communities throughfood-based approaches is needed. In conclusion, this systematic review suggests there is suf ﬁcient evidence to support food-based approaches as a potential strategy to improving vitamin A statusamong pregnant or lactating women and children under 5 y.Acknowledgments We acknowledge the support of Ellen Lutz, Librarian, Uni- versity of Massachusetts Amherst.
