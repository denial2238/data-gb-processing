Methods Four-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were fed with different VD reproductive diets throughout the whole pregnancy and lactation. The characteristics of BMSCs from their seven-day male offspring, VDR knockdown estab - lishment of HuMSCs and HuMSCs under the different VD interventions in vitro were confirmed by flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence.The roles of VD on their mitochondrial dysfunction and differentiation potential were also investigated.Then their remaining weaned male pups were induced by administrating high-fat-diet (HFD) for 16 weeks and normal fat diet was simultaneously as controls.Their lipid accumulation and adipocytes hypertrophy were determined by histological staining and related gene expressions.Results Herein, it was proved that imbalance of early-life VD intake could significantly aggravate the occurrence of obesity by inducing the adipogenesis through affecting the VD metabolism and related metabolites (P < 0.05).
Moreover, abnormally maternal VD intake might be involved on the disorders of differentiation potential to inhibit the maintenance of MSCs stemness through increasing the productions of ROS, which was accompanied by impair - ing the expression of related genes on the adipo-osteogenic differentiation (P < 0.05).

Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2024) 15:252 Introduction Obesity, as a metabolic disorder syndrome, is character - ized by excessive fat accumulation due to the unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles, physical inactivity, genetic susceptibility, psychosocial factors, obesogens, and even adverse early-life exposures. And it is a risky factor for later major noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) including the cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and etc.[ 1, 2].Thus, recent evidence has proved that adverse early-life exposures during the pregnancy and lacta - tion, as a critical time for metabolic programming, could induce the long-term effects on the later obesity, which is referred as Early metabolic programming of long-term health and disease using the experimental animal, obser - vational and clnical intervention studies [3, 4].
However, a growing body of evidence is paid attentions on the overall nutritional factors, the roles of early-life nutri - ents linked to the risk of later obesity have not yet been elucidated [3–5]. Moreover, it has been known that the deficiency of critical nutrients are still endemic in China to cause the substantial impacts on maternal and neo - natal poor health outcomes, such as vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fats and so on [6], in which vitamin D (VD) defi - ciency, defined as < 50 nM, is found commonly among the Chinese pregnant women, with ranging from 40% to 84% [7].Overall, as a fat-soluble hormone, VD can widely play its role on the occurrence of obesity by maintaining calcium homeostasis, bone integrity, glucose metabo - lism, angiogenesis, inflammation and immune function, partly through regulating the related gene expressions [8–10].Otherwise, there is limited evidence supporting the related mechanisms of early-life VD status on later obesity.
In general, the development of obesity is characterized by hypertrophic adipocytes along with the increasing numbers of mature adipocytes, which is all differentiated from the pre-adipocytes, like as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [11]. As a common progenitor cell of adipocytes, MSCs could efficiently alleviate the HFD-induced hyper - glycemia through inhibiting the inflammation, improv - ing insulin sensitivity, decreasing hepatic steatosis and etc.[ 12].Moreover, numerous in vitro investigations have demonstrated that a variety of external cues are contributed to the delicate balances of adipo-osteogenic differentiation, including nutrients, chemical, physical, and biological factors, which can trigger different signal - ing pathways and activate the related various transcrip - tion factors, such as PPARγ, C/EBPα, Runx2 and so on [13–15].
Thus, on the balances of adipo-osteogenic dif - ferentiation of MSCs, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress have been shown to be increased to play their important roles on the adipo-osteogenic dif - ferentiation through the Wnt pathway, PPARγ and so on [16, 17]. To our knowledge, it supports that stimulating actions of VD could inhibit the potential of adipogenesis and enhance osteogenic differentiation using the mouse models [18, 19].Meanwhile, in vitro VD supplementa - tion could interferes with the adipogenic fate of MSCs and 3T3-L1 adipocytes [20].Otherwise, less is known about the imbalance of early-life VD on the differentia - tion potential of MSCs associated the occurrence of later obesity.Mechanistically, mitochondrial homeostasis is the cru - cial mechanism underlying the accumulation of ROS on the adipo-osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.
It can be regulated by sophisticated regulatory networks through coordinating the various cellular pathways to preserve the mitochondrial function, especially the interplay between mitochondrial biogenesis, fission–fusion and mitophagy through a large number of related transcrip - tion factors including PGC1α, Tfam, Drp1, Mfn1, Opa1, Pink1, Parkin, P62, LC3b and etc. [21–23].Truly, previ - ous researches proved that the mitochondrial biogen - esis could provide the newly synthesized mitochondria of MSCs to balance the cellular homeostasis [21–24].Additionally, mitochondria undergoes the rapid dynamic fission and fusion cycle to ensure the mitochondrial integrity, and maintain mitochondrial function [25].Meanwhile, mitophagy process also serves as another machinery for maintaining the mitochondrial integrity and quality control to alleviate their damages, which are caused by ROS and established a new network of mature through eliminating the immature mitochondria [26, 27].
Thus, restoring the mitochondrial homeostasis of maternal VD status could conversely enhance the osteogenic differentiation with slightly lower ROS (P < 0.05). Further - more, the underlying mechanisms might be involved on the mitochondria dysfunctional, especially the mitophagy, by activating the LC3b, P62 and etc.using in vivo and in vitro studies (P < 0.05).Conclusion These findings demonstrated that imbalance of early-life VD intake could target ROS-mediated cross- talk between mitochondrial dysfunction and differentiation potential of MSCs, which was significantly associated with the later obesity.Obviously, our results could open up an attractive modality for the benefits of suitable VD intake during the pregnancy and lactation.Keywords Vitamin D, Early-life, Obesity, Mesenchymal stem cells, Mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS Page 3 of 18 Li et al.Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2024) 15:252 MSCs is possibly an effective method to resist the oxi - dative stress.
Nevertheless, there is only limited knowl - edge about the mechanisms by which the imbalance of early-life VD might target mitochondrial dysfunction to regulate the differentiation potential of MSCs. So in this study, we aimed to evaluate that whether the imbal - ance of early-life vitamin D could targets ROS-mediated crosstalk between mitochondrial dysfunction and differ - entiation potential of MSCs associated the later obesity using the in vivo and in vitro models.Materials and methods Mice Forty-eight four-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technol - ogy Co.Ltd.(Beijing, China), and housed at the Animal Center of Academy in the Military Medical Sciences.
They were maintained on a 12-h light–dark schedule in the suitable temperature (22–25℃) and humidity- controlled environment with the modified gestating and growing formula (D10012G), which were respectively containing 25 IU (VD deficient group, VD-D, n = 16), 1000 IU (Control group, VD-C, n = 16) and 10000 IU (VD excessive group, VD-E, n = 16) VD3/kg reproduc - tive diets for eight weeks. Then six female mice in each group (n = 6/group) were executed to determine the con - tents of VD and other metabolic indicators before mat - ing.To produce F1 generation mice, the remaining mice (n = 10/group) were mated with 12-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (2:1/cage) to produce the chow-fed males, and continued on their own diets throughout the whole gestation and lactation.Then seven-day-old male F1 off - spring (n = 9/group from more than three cages) in each group were executed to obtain their BMSCs respec - tively.
While the 21-day male offspring (n = 8/group) were weaned onto the high fat diet (HFD, 34.9% fat by weight, 60% kcal, No. H10060; VD-C-HFD, VD-D-HFD, VD-E-HFD groups) for 16 weeks, with the normal diet (4.3% fat by weight, 10% kcal, No.H10010) was simul - taneously as the control group (VD-C).All above diets were purchased from the Beijing HFK Bioscience Co., LTD (Beijing, China) [28].At the whole procedure, the body weight, food and energy intake in each group were recorded weekly.Then they were anesthetized by the car - bon dioxide inhalation (CO2) at the end of study design point using a CO2 line-connected box at a gas infusion rate of 2.0L/min.Once all the mice cease their respiration for 5–10 min, the euthanasia was confirmed by cervical dislocation.
Immediately, their spleen, brown adipose tis - sue (BAT) and epididymal white adipose tissues (eWAT) were freely dissected from the surrounding tissues, in which some were fixed by 10% phosphate buffered for - malin, and the others were frozen in the liquid N2. Then the serum samples were separated and obtained at 3000 r/min for 15 min after stewing 30 min at the room tem - perature.After the experiment finished, all tissues were then transferred and stored in a − 80 °C refrigerator until use.All procedures were in accordance with Beijing Acad - emy of Military Medical Sciences Guide for the Care and Usage Committee of Laboratory Animals.The animal protocols were approved by Ethics of Animal Experi - ments in the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in China (No.IACUC-DWZX-2019-704).Meanwhile, the whole work had been reported in line with the ARRIVE guidelines 2.0.
Determination of spleen inter‑cellular inflammatory cytokines The spleen samples (n = 8/group) were immediately treated when the mice were euthanized to determine the inter-cellular cytokines in the maternal VD-C, VD-D and VD-E groups. Exactly, the splenetic lymphocytes were isolated and stained with the anti-mouse CD3-PE (12-0031-82, eBioscience, CA, USA) and CD8-FITC (11-0041-85, eBioscience, CA, USA) for 30 min at 4 °C.Then they were fixed and permeabilized using the dilu - ent (TNB-1020-l050, TONBO Bio-sciences, CA, USA) and stained with anti-mouse IFN-γ-APC (20-7311-U100, TONBO Bio-sciences, CA, USA) and IL-17-APC (17- 7177-82, eBioscience, CA, USA) for 30 min at 4 ℃.All flow cytometric analysis was performed on the FACS- calibur flow cytometer system (Beckman Coulter, Fuller - ton, CA, USA), and analyzed by the FlowJo10 software.Measurement of metabolic parameters and VD biomarkers in the serum Serum triglyceride (TG, No.A110-1-1), total choles - terol (TC, No.
A111-1-1), insulin (INS, No. H203-1-2), alanine transaminase (ALT, No.C009-1-1), aspartate transaminase (AST, No.C010-2-1), low density lipopro - tein (LDL, No.A113-1-1), high density lipoprotein (HDL, No.A112-1-1), parathyroid hormone (PTH, No.H207), calcium (No.C004-2-1), inorganic phosphate (Pi, No.C006-1-1), alkaline phosphatase (ALP , No.C006-1-1), 25(OH)D3 (No.H191-1-2) and 1,25(OH)2D3 (No.H191- 2-2) were determined by the commercial kits from Nan - jing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China through following the manufacturer’s protocols.Mean - while, the contents of serum VD3 (No.ml077277) and glucose (No.ml076792) were analyzed by the kits from Shanghai Enzyme-linked Biotechnology Co., Ltd.China.Histological analyses of eWAT eWAT samples from the VD-C, VD-D-HFD, VD-C- HFD and VD-E-HFD groups were fixed in the 4% Page 4 of 18 Li et al.Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2024) 15:252 paraformaldehyde for 24 h at the room temperature.
All samples were then dehydrated by the immersion in the 100% ethanol for 24 h and processed for paraffin embedding. Then 5 µm sections were stained with hae - matoxylin and eosin (HE) to measure the adipocyte size and inflammatory infiltration under a light microscope at 200 × magnification, and then analyzed by Image-pro Plus 6.0.All histological experiments were performed by the Servicebio (Beijing, China).Isolation, culture, and characterization of BMSCs The BMSCs were isolated and cultured as we previously described [12].Briefly, mouse BMSCs were routinely maintained in the α-MEM medium (Hyclone), which was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), penicillin (107U/L) and streptomycin (10 mg/L) in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C.The adherent BMSCs were cultured with fresh medium for another 6- 8 days, in which the medium was changed every two days until they were confluent.
Then the mor - phology of BMSCs at the third generation (P3) from the VD-C, VD-D and VD-E groups were observed by the light microscope. The immunophenotypic characteri - zation of these BMSCs were evaluated via flow cytom - etry, as positive for CD29 (No.ab-2572449), CD90 (No.ab-469640) and Sca-1 (No.ab-2539218) and negative for haematopoietic markers CD34 (No.ab-11-0341-82), CD45 (No.ab-465050) and CD31(No.ab-657735) (eBio - science, Waltham, MA, USA).Meanwhile, the BMSCs were then cultured in the 10% fetal α-MEM medium with the adipogenic (Sigma, Germany-10−3 mM dexa - methasone, 0.5 mM isobutyl methylxanthine, 0.2 mM indomethacin, and 10 μg/mL insulin) and osteogenic induction (Sigma, Germany- 10−7 mM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM ascorbic acid, and 10 mM β-glycerol phosphate) for seven days.Then their morphology was respectively evaluated by Oil Red O staining for adipogenesis and ALP for osteogenesis.
While the proliferation and differ - entiation of MSCs were determined by the BeyoClick™ EdU (No. C0085S) and Enhanced Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, No.C0042) from the Beyotime Co., Ltd.China.Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis The P3 BMSCs in the VD-C, VD-D and VD-E groups were digested and washed twice with PBS and primarily fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde overnight.Then they were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h.After wash - ing with PBS, the samples were progressively dehydrated in the graduated series of ethanol solutions (50, 70, 80, 90, 95 and 100%) and embedded in the mixture of Epon 812, DDSA, NMA and DMP-30.The ultra-structure of BMSCs were analyzed with a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1230, Jeol, Japan) by the Servicebio Co., Ltd (Beijing, China).A minimum of 5 photomi - crographs were taken randomly from each sample.The numbers of mitochondria were counted on the micro - graphs in a blinded fashion as previously described [27].
Meanwhile, ten microscopic fields from 3 samples per group were analyzed with at least 200 mitochondria in per group to determine the sub-population of mitochon - dria (small mitochondria: < 0.2μm2, normal mitochon - dria: 0.2–0.8μm2 and large mitochondria: > 0.8μm2). Cell culture of HuMSCs and treatments of 1,25(OH)2D in vitro Six participants (normal full-term pregnancies from healthy primiparous women without any metabolic and genetic diseases, aged between 25 and 28 years old) and their guardians should provide the informed consents for the usage of their umbilical cord tissues after they were clearly informed the significance of this survey by the trained investigators, which was approved by the Ethi - cal Committee of the Fuxing Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University in China (No: IEC-C-006-A04-V.06).
Approximately 5 cm umbilical cord was obtained during the produce and transferred to the department of Experi - mental Hematology and Biochemistry, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine as soon as possible to isolate the HuMSCs under sterile conditions as previously described [28, 29]. Exactly, the umbilical cord tissue was shred - ded into small pieces and digested in 0.1% type II col - lagenase at 37 °C for 45 min after removing the residual blood, veins, and arterial vasculature.Then the digested tissue was transferred into α-MEM medium (Hyclone), which was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mM glutamine, 100U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.Therefore, the HuMSCs were cultured in Fresh culture medium every 2 to 3 days and assessed using flow cytometry to detect the purity of HuMSCs (positive for CD29, CD90 and Sca-1, and nega - tive for CD45, CD34, and CD11b), in which HuMSCs at the P3-P5 were used for the subsequent experiments.
The stable HuMSCs were respectively treated with 2 nM, 10 nM, 50 nM and 100 nM 1,25(OH)2D (D1530, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), which was dissolved in the anhydrous ethanol for 48 h.Meanwhile, HuMSCs in vitro, treated with different 1,25(OH)2D, were cultured in the above adipogenic and osteogenic induction medium for seven days.The morphology was evaluated by Oil Red O staining for adipogenesis and ALP for osteogenesis [29].While the proliferation and differentiation of HuM - SCs treated with different 1,25(OH)2D (2 nM, 10 nM, 50 nM and 100 nM) were determined by the BeyoClick™ EdU (No.C0085S) and CCK-8 (No.C0042) from the Bey - otime Co., Ltd.China.Page 5 of 18 Li et al.Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2024) 15:252 Establishment of lentivirus‑mediated VDR knockdown HuMSCs pCDH-puro-HA-VDR lentiviral vector was previously constructed.
The short hairpin RNA (shRNA-VDR, GCC TGA CCC TGG TGA CTT TGA) targeting VDR and nega - tive control shRNA (NC-RNA, TTC TCC GAA CGT GTC ACG T) oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the pLKO.1-puro lentiviral vector, which were synthe - sized by the Sangon (Shanghai, China). Briefly, HuMSCs were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/10 cm dish and co-transfected with lentiviral expression vector contain - ing ShRNA-VDR and NC-RNA scramble using the lipo - fectamine.Forty-eight hours after the lentivirus infection, HuMSCs were selected in the presence of puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 72 h to generate the stable VDR knockdown HuMSCs using the polybrene according to the manufac - turer’s instructions.Then the transduction efficiency of ShRNA-VDR and NC-VDR with green fluorescent pro - tein signals were determined using the flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting (WB) methods.
Mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial ROS The ΔΨm of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in the BMSCs and HuMSCs was measured by a laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica SP8, Germany) using the 5,5’ ,6,6’- tetrachloro-1,1’ , 3,3’-tetraethyl- benzimidazolcarbocyanine (JC-1) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Meanwhile, the levels of mitochondrial ROS were determined by the MitoSOX™ red mitochondrial superoxide indicator with Mito- Tracker Red marking mitochondria using a laser scan - ning confocal microscopy (Leica SP8, Germany).Exactly, the BMSCs and HuMSCs were respectively stained with mitoSOX™ (1 μM) and Mito-Tracker Red dye (50 nM) for 60 min in the darkness.Then they were washed by PBS three times and 4% Paraformaldehyde fixation for 20 min.And the staining images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope (Leica SP8, Germany).
The fluo - rescence intensity of each tracer in various conditions was expressed as the fold of change versus the control cells, and incubated in the complete culture medium. All data was obtained from experiments with at least three replicates.
Assessment of mitochondrial quality control For the mitochondrial quality control (biogenesis, fusion, fission, and mitophagy) assessment in the BMSCs and HuMSCs, the related genes on the mitochondrial mitophagy (Pink1, Parkin, P62, Map1lc3b), dynamics (Drp1, Mfn1, Opa1) and biogenesis (PGC1α, TFAM) were determined by RT-PCR and WB methods, with GAPDH as the invariant internal control.Quantitative real‑time PCR Total RNA was extracted from the eWAT, BMSCs and HuMSCs using the Trizol reagent (TaKaRa, Japan), and then RT-PCR was performed by the SYBR-RT-PCR master kits (AQ131-04, TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) with CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad Labora - tories) to determine the expression levels of genes on the adipogenesis (PPARγ , C/EBPα, LPL, Fabp4, Adiponectin, Resistin and Leptin), osteogenesis (Runx2 , ALP , COL1A1, Osteocalcin and Osteopontin) and mitochondrial func - tion (PGC1α, Tfam , Mfn1, Opa1, Drp1, Pink1, Parkin , P62, LC3b), with GAPDH as the invariant internal con - trol.
The assays were performed in triplicates and nor - malized to the internal standard mRNA levels using the 2−▲▲CT and/or 2−▲CT method. Western blotting analysis The equal quantities of total protein (20 μg) in the BMSCs and HuMSCs were separated by 8% to 15% SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immo - bilon P , Millipore, MA, USA).
Then the membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% skim milk in TBST and incubated with primary antibodies against PPAR-γ (#2435, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), C/ EBPα (#2295, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), ALP (sc-365765, Santa Cruz, 1:100), COL1A1 (#72,026, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), Runx2 (#8486, Cell Sign - aling Technology, 1:1000), Ocn (sc-365797, Santa Cruz, 1:100), VDR (#12,550, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), Pink1 (sc-517353, Santa Cruz, 1:100), Parkin (sc-32282, Santa Cruz, 1:100), P62 (#5114, Cell Signaling Technol - ogy, 1:1000), LC3b (L7543, Sigma, 1:1000), Mfn1 (sc- 166644, Santa Cruz, 1:100), Opa1(#80471, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), Drp1 (ab184247, abcam, 1:1000) and PGC1α (sc-518025, Santa Cruz, 1:100) overnight at 4 °C, which were then incubated with anti-Rabbit (ab6721, abcam, 1:10,000) and anti-mouse (#7076, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:3000) HRP-conjugated second - ary antibodies.
The excess antibody was washed off with the TBST in triplicates. Their expressions were detected according to the manufacturer’s instructions using an ECL detection system (Millipore, MA, USA).Then these results were normalized with the GAPDH (#5174, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000).Statistical analyses The statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 21.0, with α level of 0.05 and effect coefficient of 0.90.The animal experiments were performed with n ≥ 6 mice/ group, while cell studies were repeated thrice indepen - dently with the minimum of three replicates.Then all values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, in which the Percent-Percent plot was chosen to determine Page 6 of 18 Li et al.Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2024) 15:252 the normality of data.
Then the differences among all groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the continuous variables with normal distribution, which were then followed by the Student– Newman–Keuls test between each two groups. Differ - ences were considered statistically significant as P < 0.05.Results Biochemical and inflammatory indicators among the maternal mice under the different calcium status As shown in Fig.1A, comparing with the VD-C group, the spleen FOXP3+CD4+ immune cells were lower in the VD-E group (P < 0.05), while the other inflammatory indi - cators did not significantly different among the VD-C, VD-D and VD-E groups (P > 0.05).Moreover, maternal body weight, food intake, energy intake, and serum bio - chemical indicators (blood glucose, ALT, AST, TC, TG, LDL, HDL, ALP , calcium and Pi) before mating were not significantly different (Fig.1B–I, N and O, P > 0.05).However, comparing with the VD-C group, there was lower serum VD metabolites, like VD3 (Fig.
1J), 25(OH) D3 (Fig. 1K) and 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig.1L), and higher PTH (Fig.1M) in the VD-D group, with higher contents of VD3, 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3, and lower PTH in the VD-E group (P < 0.05).All above indicators proved that the animal model was successful.Abnormal maternal VD intake attenuated the development of obesity among the HFD male offspring The effects of appropriate maternal VD intake on the development of obesity among their male offspring were demonstrated in Fig.2.Comparing with the VD-C group, HFD-fed male offspring (VD-C-HFD, VD-D-HFD and VD-E-HFD) were gained higher body weight, more energy intake, larger adipocytes, and more disorders on the glucose/lipid metabolism indicators (P < 0.05).Then, we further investigated the roles of abnormal mater - nal VD intake on the occurrences of obesity among the above three HFD-fed male offspring, comparing with Fig.1 Biochemical and inflammatory indicators among the maternal mice before mating under the different calcium status.

Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2024) 15:252 the VD-C-HFD group, maternal VD deficient intake during the pregnancy and lactation (VD-D-HFD) could profoundly aggravate the occurrence of obesity (Fig. 2A, P < 0.05), which were corresponded with the significant increases of INS (Fig.2F), impaired lipolysis (TG, ALT, AST and ALP , Fig.2I and K) and larger adipocyte hyper - trophy (BAT and eWAT, Fig.2G and H), with higher expressions of related genes on the C/EBPα, Leptin, LPL and Fabp4, and lower VDBP on the proliferation and dif - ferentiation of adipocytes (Fig.2N and O) (P < 0.05).Oth - erwise, there were lower serum 25(OH)D3 (Fig.2L) and higher PTH (Fig.2M) in the VD-D-HFD group (P < 0.05).Then there were no significant impacts on the body weight (Fig.2A) and adipocyte diameters (Fig.2G and H) in the VD-E-HFD group than those in the VD-C-HFD group (P > 0.05).
Otherwise, maternal VD excessive VD intake (VD-E-HFD) could profoundly decrease the con - tents of related indicators on the glucose (INS, Fig. 2F) and lipid metabolism (LDL, AST), with higher levels of related genes (Adiponectin, VDR and VDBP ) (Fig.2N and O), by increasing the contents of VD metabolites such as VD3, 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig.2L, P < 0.05).Abnormal maternal VD intake braked the balances of osteogenic‑adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs from the male offspring The rationale cause of obesity is raised from abnormal proliferation and differentiation of MSCs.Therefore, we examined the effects of different maternal VD intake on the differentiation potential of BMSCs to analyze the Fig.2 Abnormal maternal VD intake attenuated the development of obesity among the HFD-fed male offspring.

Comparing with the VD-C group, early-life insufficient VD intake as VD-D group could induced high mRNA expressions of genes on adipogenic differen - tiation, like PPARγ , C/EBPα, Leptin, Adiponectin, Resist and LPL, and lower levels of osteogenic genes such as Runx2, COL1A1, and VDR (P < 0.05), with higher protein contents of PPARγ and C/EBPα, and lower contents of VDR, ALP and Runx2 (P < 0.05). It all suggested that the BMSCs from male offspring in the VD-D group was more likely to differentiate into adipocytes.Otherwise, early- life VD supplementation (VD-E group) could remark - ably suppress the mRNA expressions on the genes related to adipogenesis such as PPARγ and Resist , and induced high expressions of osteogenic genes as Runx2 , COL1A1, ALP , Opn, Ocn and VDR than those in the VD-C group (P < 0.05), with higher protein contents of ALP , Ocn and Fig.3 Abnormal maternal VD intake braked the balances of osteogenic-adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs from the male offspring.

Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2024) 15:252 Runx2, and lower contents of C/EBPα (P < 0.05). All these above demonstrated that maternal VD supplementation (VD-E group) was able to inhibit the preadipocytes dif - ferentiation and promote the osteogenic differentiation.Likewise, the findings both from the VD-D and VD-E groups confirmed that abnormal maternal VD intake lead to the decreases in their own dryness, accompany - ing by the significantly different changes of related genes on the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, which were inevitably braked the osteogenic-adipogenic differ - entiation balances of BMSCs from male offspring.More - over, the proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs, as the results in EdU (Fig.3H) and CCK-8 (Fig.3I), were not significantly different in the VD-C, VD-D and VD-E groups (P > 0.05).
Abnormal maternal VD intake augmented the ROS production and mitochondrial damages of BMSCs from the male offspring It had previously reported that BMSCs differentiation was activated by the excess ROS production, so we deter - mined whether abnormal maternal VD intake could augment the ROS production and mitochondrial dam - ages in the BMSCs from their male offspring (Fig. 4).To determine the ROS production, both the VD-D and VD-E groups showed there were higher stimulated ROS production by the mitoSox fluorescence (Fig.4B and D) than those in the VD-C group (P < 0.05), which was con - sisted with the above different differentiation potential.Taken together, mitochondria was mostly in an elon - gated tubular form with the interconnected reticular networks for the ROS production, the results of TEM provided further details of more mitochondrial damages in the VD-D and VD-E groups than those in the VD-C (Fig.
4E and F, P < 0.05), which was accompanied with the reduced mitochondrial density, and surface areas. Meanwhile, the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and mitochondrial damages were more serious in the VD-D group than those in the VD-E group by the JC-1 dye fluorescence (Fig.4C and D P < 0.05).Likewise, the related genes for mitochondrial function, including the biogenesis (PGC1α, Tfam), fusion (Mfn1 and Opa1), fission (Drp1) and mitophagy (Pink1, Parkin, P62, LC3b and etc.) were demonstrated in Fig.4G, H (Full-length blots/gels were presented in Additional file 1: Fig.S2) and 4I.It showed that comparing with the VD-C group, the levels of PGC1α and Parkin were increased and the con - tents of Tfam, Mfn1, Opa1, Pink1, P62, and LC3b were reduced in the VD-D group (P < 0.05).Otherwise, there were higher expressions of PGC1α and lower expres - sions of P62 and LC3b in the VD-E group (P < 0.05).
These results indicated that maternal VD status could act on the mitochondria function by altering the balances of fission–fusion-mitophagy through elevating the levels of ROS production. Effects of maternal dietary VD intake on the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs among the male offspring To further evaluate the abnormal maternal VD intake on the differentiation potentials of MSCs, we treated the BMSCs with related adipogenic and osteogenic reagents respectively (Fig.5, Full-length blots/gels were presented in Additional file 1: Fig.S3).It showed that comparing with the VD-C group, early-life VD-D exposure (VD-D group) could significantly produce the increased amounts of lipid droplets (Fig.5A and B, P < 0.05), with higher expressions of PPARγ, C/EBPα, Leptin, Adiponectin, Resist, LPL and Fabp4 (P < 0.05) (Fig.5E and F).Moreo - ver, the expressions of VDR and Ocn were lower (Fig.5G and H), with the reduced ALP nodules (P < 0.05) (Fig.5C and G).
These results suggested that early-life VD defi - ciency (VD-D group) were able to alter the expression of genes on the lipogenesis and osteogenesis, contributing to the accumulations of lipid metabolism. Meanwhile, comparing with the VD-C group, early-life excessive VD exposure (VD-E group) resulted in the up-regulation of osteogenic genes such as Runx2, COL1A1, ALP , Opn and Ocn, and down-regulation of adipogenic genes as C/ EBPα (Fig.5E–H, P < 0.05), which all proved that early- life excessive VD exposure could promote the osteogenic and inhibite the adipogenic differentiation (Fig.5A–D).Imbalance of early‑life vitamin D targets ROS‑mediated crosstalk between mitochondrial dysfunction and differentiation potential Recently, many evidences had demonstrated that ele - vating ROS played an important role on the balances of stemness and differentiation of BMSCs, which could be regulated by mitochondria dysfunction (Full-length blots/gels were presented in Additional file 1: Fig.
S4 and S5). As shown in Fig.6, compare to the VD-C groups, it observed the increase damages of mitochon - dria, more mitochondria numbers and subpopulation mitochondria (higher percent of small and large mito - chondria) by TEM in the VD-D and VD-E groups both under the adipogenic (Fig.6A) and osteogenic differ - entiation (Fig.6D) (P < 0.05).Consistently, we explored the effects of VD on the mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy.Exactly, under the adipogenic differen - tiation, the expressions of mitochondrial biogenesis regulator as Tfam was increased, and contents of mito - chondrial fusion (Mfn1 and Opa1) and autophagy (Pink1, P62, LC3b and etc.) were decreased in the VD-D group than those in the VD-C group (P < 0.05).Likewise, the PGC1α was up-regulated, mitochondrial Page 10 of 18 Li et al.Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2024) 15:252 fusion (Mfn1) and autophagy (P62, and LC3b) were down-regulated in the VD-E group (P < 0.05) (Fig.6B and C).
Moreover, under the osteogenic differentiation, the expressions of mitochondrial biogenesis (Tfam and PGC1α), mitochondrial fusion (Opa1), fussion (Drp1), and mitophagy (Pink1, P62, LC3b and etc.) were lower in the VD-D and/or VD-E group than those in the VD-C group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 6 E and F).Fig.4 Abnormal maternal VD intake augmented the ROS production and mitochondrial damages of BMSCs from the male offspring.A MitoTracker Red fluorescence, B MitoSox fluorescence, C JC-1 fluorescence, D Quantitative analysis of MitoTracker, MitoSox and JC-1, E Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), F Mitochondria number, compositions and damages from the TEM, G and I Relative mRNA expressions of genes related to mitochondrial function (biogenesis, fusion, fussion, and mitophagy) and mitochondria numbers using the 2−▲▲CT method, which was defined as 1 in the VD-C group, H: Protein contents of related genes on the mitochondrial function.

Then compared with the con - trol and NC-VDR groups, the related genes on the adipo - genic differentiation (Leptin, Adiponectin, and LPL) were enhanced and osteogenic differentiation (Opn and Ocn) were attenuated by the VDR knockdown (Fig. 7E and G), which was related with more severe mitochondrial disor - ders, as the down-regulated expressions of mitochondrial biogenesis (Tfam and PGC1α), mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1 and Opa1), fission (Drp1), and mitophagy (Parkin, P62, and LC3b), and up-regulation of Pink1 (Fig.7F and H, full-length blots/gels were presented in Additional file 1: Fig.S7).Moreover, the proliferation and differentiation of HuM - SCs, as shown in EdU (Fig.7I) and CCK-8 (Fig.7J), were lower in the VDR knockout group (P < 0.05).Then, we analyzed the differentiation potential of HuMSCs under the related adipogenic and osteogenic induc - tion, it showed that VDR knockdown induced the more lipid droplets and less ALP nodules (Fig.7K and L), with Fig.

8B, C and D (Full-length blots/gels were presented in Additional file 1: Fig. S9), comparing with the appropriate 1.25(OH)2D3 exposure (10 nM), the related genes on the adipogenic differentiation (PPARγ, C/EBPα, Leptin, Adiponectin, Resist, LPL and VDBP) were increased, and osteogenic differentiation (Runx2, COL1A1, ALP , and Opn) were decreased under the low 1.25(OH)2D3 intervention (2 nM) (P < 0.05).Likewise, high 1.25(OH)2D3 exposed groups (50 nM and 100 nM) were up-regulated the gene expressions of Leptin, Adi - ponectin, Resist, LPL, COL1A1, ALP , Ocn, Opn, VDR and VDBP and down-regulated the levels of Fabp4 with a related dose–response relationship (P < 0.05).Fur - thermore, comparing with the 10 nM group, both low (2 nM) and high 1.25(OH)2D3 intervention (50 and 100 nM) groups showed more mitochondrial damages by JC-1 dye fluorescence (Fig.8E and G) and higher stim - ulated ROS productions by the mitoSox fluorescence (Fig.8F and 8G) (P < 0.05), which was accompanied by Fig.

8L, there were more lipid droplets in the low (2 nM) and high 1.25(OH)2D3 inter - vention (50 and 100 nM) groups, with high expressions of genes like as PPARγ, C/EBPα, Leptin, Adiponectin, Resist and LPL, and lower levels of osteogenic genes such as Runx2, COL1A1, ALP and Fabp4 (Fig. 8M–P , full-length blots/gels were presented in Additional file 1: Fig.S11) (P < 0.05).However, low (2 nM) 1.25(OH)2D3 intervention was significantly accompanied with lower expressions of COL1A1, ALP and Ocn (P < 0.05), with no significantly different in the high 1.25(OH)2D3 interven - tion groups (50 and 100 nM) (P > 0.05).Discussion Currently, it has been proved that reasonable nutrition intake and lifestyle during the pregnancy and lactation can induce the long-term effects on the later health of their children, including the risk of NCDs such as obe - sity, diabetes and so on[30], with the consequences that can even extend across the intergenerational and inter - generational transmission.

So we out - lined the correlations between maternal VD deficient intake (VD-D group) and life-long effects on the devel - opment of obesity among their offspring. Meanwhile, the depth discussions were also conducted the influ - ences of early-life VD supplementation (VD-E group) on their male offspring.Here, our results also demon - strated that early-life VD deficient intake (VD-D group) attenuated the development of obesity by aggravating the related lipid metabolism (P < 0.05).Moreover, no impacts on body weight and adipose diameters were shown under the VD-E group (P > 0.05), but it could significantly improve the metabolic disorders by HFD induction (P < 0.05).Yet, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear.As the multi-potent sources of adipocytes, aberrant development of MSCs may contribute to the impaired tissue homeostasis and increase the risk of obesity onsets in the adulthood [34, 35].
Likewise, it has been demon - strated that the differentiation potential of MSCs mainly occurs in early life, whose numbers and differentiation potential were significantly declined with the age [36], so the lineage-dependent differentiation of MSCs may be disturbed by early-life (especially pregnancy and lac - tation) environmental and nutritional exposure to cause the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of adipo - cytes to increase the incidence of later obesity by trigger - ing different signaling pathways through activating the various transcription factors [34–36], in which the com - mitments of MSCs were mainly involved in either adipo - genesis and/or osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, numerous in vitro investigations had demonstrated that there were balances of adipo-osteogenic differentiation [37].
In fact, existing in vitro experiments reported that VD exposure could affected the balances of adipo-oste - ogenic differentiation of MSCs by activating the related pathway signaling [38–40]. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether maternal different VD exposure could regulated the adipo-osteogenic differentiation through these above pathways on the inter-generational obesity transmis - sion among their male offspring.Thus, our findings in both VD-D and VD-E groups confirmed that abnormally maternal VD intake could lead to significantly different changes of related genes on the adipogenic and/or oste - ogenic differentiation of MSCs, which inevitably prones to the adipogenic differentiation in the VD-D group and osteogenic differentiation in the VD-E group (P < 0.05).It was consisted with the existing known results [38–40].
As evidenced in numerous studies, MSCs have been used as an important cell source for tissue homeostasis and regenerative usages due to their stemness character - istics, pluripotency and self-renewal capability. Herein, maintaining their stemness is crucial for helping us to keep fit [41, 42], in which MSCs could undergo the func - tional deterioration and gradually lose stemness with sys - tematic injury in vivo or extended culture in vitro, which is recognized as a complicated process and regulated by multiple mechanisms such as DNA damages, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, and so on [43].
As a metabolic byproduct, ROS is critical for the final fate of MSCs, which has proved that the reduc - tion of cellular ROS leads to a wide variety of other det - rimental responses and holds a prominent place on the maintenance of MSCs, including the mitochondrial mal - function, autophagy suppression and so on, which is in turn contributed to produce the lower levels of intro- cellular ROS, forming a positive feedback loop, especially the casual correlations between mitochondrial dysfunc - tion and ROS. Conversely, it will form a vicious cycle that could disturb the balances between ROS and anti - oxidants, which in turn results in an elevated numbers of mitochondria and augmented mitochondrial ROS pro - duction [44, 45].So far, most hypoxia studies showed that long term culture of MSCs in the hypoxia was promoted a genetic program to maintain their undifferentiated and multi-potent status, with lower levels of oxidative phos - phorylation to keep their stemness.
Otherwise, MSCs could be activated to their different differentiation status with related external stimuli elements when the levels of ROS were increasing [46, 47]. Taken together, it also demonstrated the balances of osteogenic-adipogenic dif - ferentiation were partly ROS dependent [46], in which low and intermediate levels of ROS could easily drive to the osteogenic differentiation.Furthermore, abnormally elevated ROS was positively supported an unrestricted oxidative environment for launching signaling events on the adipogenic differentiation [47].Consistent here - with our findings, it proved that abnormal maternal VD intake in both the VD-D and VD-E groups could inhibit the maintenance of their stemness, with the increas - ing potential of adipogenic differentiation in the VD-D group, and osteogenic differentiation in the VD-E group.
All these results were consisted with their ROS levels and mitochondrial damages, which was consisted with the U-shaped exposure response curves in the risk assess - ment of essential nutrients [48]. As we all konwn, various studies have suggest that mitochondrial activity or dormancy plays an important role on maintaining the undifferentiated states of MSCs, Page 16 of 18 Li et al.Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2024) 15:252 whereas proper activation is essential for their success - ful differentiation.In addition, mitochondrial ROS are reported to play on their roles on both regulating the differentiation process and contributing to the direction determinations of their differentiation [49, 50].How - ever, the understanding metabolisms of its role on the mitochondria during the differentiation of MSCs were still lack on its early stages, so a deeper knowledge of these interactions between mitochondria dynamics and MSC differentiation is still needed [51].
In this process, mitochondrial quality control is regulated by the criti - cal physiological mechanisms, including the biogenesis, fusion, fission and/or mitophagy for the maintenance of MSCs quiescence, stemness, survival, differentiation, and longevity. Thus, the imbalance between fusion and fis - sion events, and inhibition of mitophagy could induce the accumulations of damaged mitochondria and meta - bolic dysfunction, which thus suggested a protective role on the normal mitochondrial quality control in the biol - ogy of MSCs [52].What is more, mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1 and Opa1) and mitophagy (Pink1, P62, LC3b and etc.) in our study were decreased in the VD-D group.
Likewise, mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1) and mitophagy (P62 and LC3b) were down-regulated in the VD-E group under the adipogenic induction, with the reduced mito - chondrial density, numbers, and surface areas both in the BMSCs and HuMSCs, which were raising the possibil - ity that mitophagy induction could mainly modulate the ROS production. Meanwhile, it is a growing appreciation that there were negative relations between the mitophagy and ROS production.Moreover, mitophagy activation, as a selective degradation of damaged mitochondria, could protect the MSCs from oxidative stress, whereas mitophagy suppression was resulted in the enhanced ROS accumulation [53].So it is likely that mitophagy acts as a self-defensive mechanism against oxidative stress- induced differentiation.
Conclusion Taken together, our study demonstrated that maternal imbalance VD intake during the pregnancy and lactation could significantly aggravate the development of HFD- induced obesity among their male offspring through increasing the lipid accumulation, and inhibiting the energy expenditure. The underlying mechanisms might be involved in elevating the ROS-mediated crosstalk between mitochondrial dysfunction and differentiation potential of MSCs (both BMSCs and HuMSCs) to lead the progression of later obesity.Certainly, our results could provide a new insight on elucidating the mecha - nisms of suitable VD intake during the pregnancy and lactation for the prevention of later obesity and related metabolic disorder diseases in the future.Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi.org/ 10.1186/ s13287- 024- 03860-8.Additional file 1: Fig.
