These agents have been suggested for all dementia types, but may have particular utility in vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). We used systematic review and meta-analyses to summarize evidence of eﬃcacy in all cause dementia, with a subgroup analysis restricted to VCI.Methods: We searched multidisciplinary, electronic databases from inception to August 2020.We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and framed results using GRADE criteria.We used random eﬀects models to create summary estimates.Our primary outcome was change in cognition based on any quantitative cognitive assessment scale using standardized mean diﬀerence (SMD).We assessed various secondary eﬃcacy outcomes and a safety outcome of serious adverse events.We performed subgroup analyses limited to VCI.
Results: Summary estimates suggested Cerebrolysin was potentially beneﬁcial in improving cognition (8 tri- als,793 participants, SMD:-0.16, 95%CI:-0.30 to -0.03) and global function (4 trials,479 participants, OR:2.64, 95%CI:1.17 to 5.98) in the short term. There was no diﬀerence in incidence of serious adverse events (6 tri- als,1014 participants, RR:0.96, 95%CI:0.78 to 1.18).In our VCI subgroup, results were similar to the main anal- ysis, with a beneﬁcial eﬀect on cognition (SMD:-0.22, 95%CI:-0.42 to -0.03) and clinical global impression (OR 2.99, 95%CI:1.02 to 8.73).The limited number of eligible studies for Actovegin ( n = 2 trials,563 participants) and Cortexin, ( n = 1 trial,80 participants) precluded meta-analyses but data suggested potential eﬃcacy and no safety concerns.Across all included studies, risk of bias was moderate to high, there was imprecision, and certainty of evidence was considered low to very low.
Conclusion: Although published data suggest potential beneﬁts and relative safety of animal derived nootropics, the supporting evidence is weak. The size of the eﬀects demonstrated were modest and probably less than would be considered clinically relevant.1.Introduction Dementia and other neurocognitive disorders represent a growing global health challenge [1] .The economic implications are substantial with global cost of dementia predicted to exceed US $1 trillion [2] .In this context, treatments that can prevent, delay or lessen the eﬀects of dementia are urgently needed.Unfortunately, approved therapies, such as Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the NMDA receptor antagonist Memantine, are few and only provide symptomatic relief for some pa- tients, with no apparent survival beneﬁts.
Furthermore, these drugs are predominantly utilized in treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD), whereas available options to manage vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) are ∗ Corresponding author at: Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, King Abdul Aziz University, Jeddah 42751, Saudi Arabia.

Actovegin is a highly puriﬁed extract of calf’s blood comprising a mixture of over 200 biologically active components [8] . The exact mechanism of action of these agents is uncertain and pleiotropic eﬀects including neuroprotection, regulation of neuronal https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cccb.2021.100012 Received 30 November 2020; Received in revised form 22 February 2021; Accepted 7 April 2021 Available online 16 April 2021 2666-2450/©2021 The Author(s).Published by Elsevier B.V.This is an open access article under the CC BY license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ) R.A.Alsulaimani and T.J.Quinn Cerebral Circulation - Cognition and Behavior 2 (2021) 100012 metabolism, and neurotrophic activity have been postulated [ 7 , 9 , 10 ].Direct and indirect eﬀects of the nootropics on the cerebrovasculature have been described and some studies have suggested beneﬁcial eﬀects in stroke recovery.
These observations suggest that nootropics may have particular beneﬁts in those cognitive syndromes with a vascular basis. Currently, Cerebrolysin is used to treat traumatic brain injury, stroke, and dementia in over 45 countries including Russia and China [ 11 , 12 ].Actovegin has been utilized for similar neurological conditions for nearly 50 years [ 8 , 9 ] and is licensed for use in Russia, Eastern Euro- pean and Asian countries [8] .Cortexin is predominantly prescribed in Russia, where it used to treat a range of acute and chronic neurological disorders including stroke and cognitive impairment [ 10 , 13 ].To date, no available drugs are clinically proven to prevent the pro- gression of cognitive decline nor restore cognitive function in people with a post-stroke dementia [8] .
Although the exact nature of nootropic eﬀects remains a source of debate, a potential eﬀect on vascular func- tion has been postulated and indeed many of these agents are used in cerebrovascular conditions such as stroke. Given the limited therapeutic options to manage VCI, nootropics may represent a promising approach to treating such conditions [7] .While numerous clinical trials have sug- gested favorable beneﬁt-risk ratios of the animal derived nootropics, available evidence is accompanied by several limitations [ 13 , 8 , 14 –16 ].Despite the extensive use of animal-derived nootropics in international healthcare, current evidence regarding their eﬃcacy and safety is con- ﬂicting.We aimed to synthesize the published evidence relating to eﬃ- cacy and safety of these three pre-speciﬁed animal-derived nootropics, using contemporary approaches for risk of bias, meta-analyses and fram- ing the quality of results.2.
Methods Our systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting in Sys- tematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 guidance [ 17 , 18 ]. All aspects of search strategy, title selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment (RoB) were independently performed by the two re- view authors with disagreement resolved through discussion.Our search strategy followed best practice in systematic review and used validated search syntax where available.We performed three reviews, one for each agent.Our review questions used the PICOS framework [19] .Our primary review question was: What is the eﬀect of Cerebrolysin, Actove- gin and Cortexin compared to placebo and/or standard care on cognitive outcomes and we pre-speciﬁed a subgroup analysis restricted to VCI.2.1.Eligibility criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with full text publi- cations.We set no restrictions on year of publication or language.
We in- cluded participants with cognitive impairment of any severity and clin- ical dementia diagnosis using validated criteria. We set no restrictions on dosage regimen, route of administration, or duration of therapy for Cerebrolysin, Actovegin and Cortexin.2.2.Outcome measures Our primary outcome measure was change in cognitive performance and could be measured by any multidomain cognitive assessment tools.We pre-speciﬁed a series of secondary eﬃcacy measures: •Clinical global function.•Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).•Activities of Daily Living (ADL).•Quality of life (QoL).•Caregiver burden.For safety measures we included reports of serious adverse events (SAEs) using standard deﬁnitions.2.3.
Search strategy We searched six multidisciplinary, international databases from in- ception to August 2020: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), APA PsycInfo (EBSCOhost), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCOhost), Literatura Latino Americana em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS) (Bireme), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) ( CNKI.net ). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov for registered and ongoing RCTs.The full syntax of the Medline search is available as supplementary ma- terials (Tables I–III).We imported titles into Mendeley Desktop software (Elsevier, version 1.19.4) [20] .We screened and reviewed titles and abstracts discard- ing irrelevant titles, and then screened remaining full texts.We created PRISMA ﬂow diagrams for each nootropic of interest [18] .From eligible studies, we recorded details on sampling frame, num- ber included, outcome measures, treatment regimen, comparator, and trial duration.2.4.
Risk of bias and quality of evidence We assessed each included study for RoB using the Revised Cochrane tool for RCTs (RoB-2) [21] . This tool evaluates bias arising from: the randomization process; deviations from intended interventions; miss- ing/incomplete outcome data; measurement of the outcome; selective reporting.We categorized global RoB as ‘low’ if all individual domains were rated low.We categorized as ‘some concern’ if at least one domain had concerns but no domains were rated high risk.We categorized as ‘high risk’ if high RoB was recorded for at least one domain or if multiple domains had some concern.We generated RoB summary ﬁgures using the robvis data visualization tool [22] .We assessed for publication bias through symmetry of funnel plots (RevMan 5.4 software) [23] .We assessed heterogeneity of eﬀect using the I 2 statistic, where a value greater than 50 suggested substantial heterogeneity.
We used sub- group analyses to explore sources of heterogeneity where applicable. We pre-speciﬁed a subgroup of interest around studies with a VCI focus and, where data allowed, we replicate our analyses limited to those papers with a VCI population.We described certainty of evidence based on ﬁve considerations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evalu- ations (GRADE) approach: study limitations, inconsistency of eﬀect, im- precision, indirectness, and publication bias [24] .We created summary of ﬁndings tables using GRADEpro GDT software (version 3.6, Evidence Prime) [25] .2.5.Measures of treatment eﬀect Where data allowed we performed meta-analyses using Cochrane Re- view Manager (RevMan 5.4) software [23] .For continuous outcomes, we recorded mean, standard deviation (SD), and sample size ( n ) of inter- vention and control groups.
For articles reporting standard error (SE) or 95% conﬁdence intervals (95% CIs), rather than the SD, the generic in- verse variance method was used to derive SD [23] . We described results of continuous outcomes as mean diﬀerences (MD) with corresponding 95% CIs.For those outcomes where the construct was assessed using varying measures, we used standardized mean diﬀerence (SMD).Where there were diﬀerences in direction of the scale, values with positive scores indicating improvement, were multiplied by -1 to allow consis- tency of direction of eﬀect.For dichotomous outcomes, we recorded number of events of interest and the total number of participants, in both intervention and control groups.Results of dichotomous outcomes were presented as odds ratios (ORs) and risk ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% CIs.2 R.A.Alsulaimani and T.J.Quinn Cerebral Circulation - Cognition and Behavior 2 (2021) 100012 Fig.1.

Seven studies were rated as ‘some concerns’ in the deviations from intended interventions domain as they did not account for impor- tant baseline diﬀerences in the analyses [ 15 , 16 , 26 , 27 , 29 –31 ]. One study was judged high risk because it was not blinded and did not account for baseline diﬀerences [28] .In one study, attrition bias was rated as ‘some concerns’, as loss to follow-up was 42 out of 279 (15%) with incon- sistencies in the reasons for discontinuation and proportions of missing data (10% (Cerebrolysin) vs.19% (Control)) [32] .One study was judged high risk for outcome assessment as assessors were not blinded [28] .Six studies were graded as ‘some concerns’ for selective reporting as there was no available protocol and details in the published report were in- adequate [ 15 , 16 , 27 , 28 , 30 , 31 ].RoB ratings are illustrated at individual study level ( Fig.2 A) and in aggregate (Fig.I; available as supplementary materials).3.2.2.
Actovegin One study was graded ‘some concerns’ for deviation from intended interventions domain as the analysis did not account for important base- line diﬀerences [33] . One study was graded ‘some concerns’ for the at- trition domain, as the number lost to follow up was 8 out of 60 (13%) and there were diﬀerences in the reasons for discontinuation and pro- portion of missing data (5% (Actovegin) vs.30% (Control)) [33] .One study was graded ‘some concerns’ around selective reporting as there was no protocol and details in the published report were inadequate [33] .RoB ratings are illustrated at individual study level ( Fig.2 B) and in aggregate (Fig.II; available as supplementary materials).3.2.3.Cortexin For the one eligible study, the randomization process was graded ‘some concerns’, as details pertaining to random sequence generation, allocation concealment and baseline characteristics were not described.
The included study was judged to be at high RoB in the deviation from intended intervention domain, as information about participants and trial personnel blinding, and the analyses utilized to estimate the eﬀect of the intervention were not provided. The included trial was at high risk of attrition bias because the extent of missing data was not reported for one outcome and partially reported for the other outcome.Details pertaining to the blinding of outcome assessors were not provided, and therefore, it was judged to be at high RoB in this domain.The study was graded ‘some concerns’ for selective reporting as there was no protocol and details in the published report were inadequate.RoB ratings are illustrated at individual study level (ﬁgure III; avail- able as supplementary materials).3.3.Eﬀects of interventions 3.3.1.Cerebrolysin Cognitive function: Across the included studies, cognitive performance was assessed using diﬀerent instruments.
The Alzheimer’s Disease As- sessment Scales (ADAS-Cog/ADAS-Cog + ) were used in eight studies [ 14 , 15 , 26 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 34 , 35 ]; and Folstein’s Mini-Mental State Examina- tion (MMSE) in seven studies [ 14 , 16 , 26 , 29 , 31 , 32 , 35 ]. Two studies were not included in the meta-analysis as one used an active control [34] ; and the other study evaluated a diﬀerent dose of Cerebrolysin (20 ml) to all the other trials [14] .The remaining RCTs all evaluated 30 ml/day of Intravenous Cerebrolysin compared to placebo.We quantiﬁed two summary measures of eﬀect to account for the diﬀering timeframes at which outcome data were collected.Short term eﬀects (less than four weeks from initiation of Cerebrolysin) were as- sessed in 793 participants from eight studies, of which 404 received Cerebrolysin.There was a SMD of -0.16-point (95%CI:-0.30 to -0.03; P = 0.02; Fig.3 A) in favor of Cerebrolysin.This improvement was con- sistent across the included studies ( I 2 = 0).
There was substantial fun- nel plot asymmetry suggesting publication bias (Fig. IV(A); available as supplementary materials).The certainty of evidence was judged to be very low due to serious RoB, imprecision, and suspected publica- tion bias ( Table 2 ).Medium term eﬀects (3 to 7 months from initiation of Cerebrolysin) were assessed in 537 participants from ﬁve studies, of which 275 received Cerebrolysin.There was no apparent eﬀect, a SMD of -0.07-point (95%CI:-0.22 to 0.07; P = 0.32; Fig.3 B).Moderate sta- tistical heterogeneity was observed ( I 2 = 38%).There was substantial funnel plot asymmetry suggesting publication bias (Fig.IV(B); available as supplementary materials).The certainty of evidence was judged to be 3 R.A.Alsulaimani and T.J.Quinn Cerebral Circulation - Cognition and Behavior 2 (2021) 100012 Table 1 Summary of study characteristics of all included Cerebrolysin, Actovegin and Cortexin trials.

We dichotomized global performance into: ‘improved’, where participants demonstrated any improvement from baseline and ‘no improvement’ where participants demonstrated no change or worsened, following treatment. Across 479 participants from four studies, of which 248 received Cerebrolysin, there was improved global function in favor of Cerebrolysin OR 2.64 (95%CI:1.17 to 5.98; P = 0.02; 3C).There was substantial heterogeneity ( I 2 = 74%).Fun- nel plot analysis was not feasible due to the limited number of included studies.The certainty of evidence was judged to be very low due to very serious RoB, inconsistency and imprecision ( Table 2 ).BPSD was assessed using a variety of outcome tools.The change in the BPSD was measured by numerous instruments, including the San- 6 R.A.Alsulaimani and T.J.Quinn Cerebral Circulation - Cognition and Behavior 2 (2021) 100012 Fig.3.

Results from the 3 remaining studies with 427 participants, revealed a SMD of -0.11-point improvement in favor of Cerebrolysin (95%CI:-0.26 to 0.03; P = 0.13; Fig. 3 D) with consistent results ( I 2 = 0).Funnel plot analysis was not feasible due to the limited number of in- cluded studies.The certainty of evidence was judged to be very low due to very serious RoB and imprecision ( Table 2 ).ADL was assessed using a variety of outcome tools.Studies were ex- cluded from quantitative analysis for using an active control [34] ; using a diﬀerent dose (20 ml) [14] ; reporting a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between study groups in favor of Cerebrolysin without providing quantitative data [ 26 , 27 ]; and not reporting the ADL outcome data [35] .For the remaining 6 studies, with 809 participants, results indicated a SMD of - 0.31-point improvement in favor of Cerebrolysin (95%CI:-0.43 to -0.19; P < 0.00001; Fig 3 E).There was substantial heterogeneity ( I 2 = 83%).
The certainty of evidence was judged to be very low due to serious RoB, inconsistency, imprecision, and suspected publication bias ( Table 2 ). None of the included trials assessed quality of life or caregiver bur- den.Safety: Seven studies, 1147 participants, reported suﬃcient detail to be included in meta-analyses of safety [ 14 , 30 –32 , 34 , 35 ].One study was excluded because an active control was used [34] .There was no apparent diﬀerence in incidence of SAE between study arms (Cere- brolysin:4.9% vs.control:4.0%; RR:1.16, 95%CI:0.67 to 2.02; P = 0.59; Fig.3 F) with consistent results ( I 2 = 0).Funnel plot analysis was not feasible due to the limited number of included studies.The certainty 7 R.A.Alsulaimani and T.J.Quinn Cerebral Circulation - Cognition and Behavior 2 (2021) 100012 Fig.4.Forest plots comparing the change of various outcomes from baseline in patients with vascular cognitive impairment receiving Cerebrolysin vs.placebo, at the ﬁnal follow-up visit.
Cognition (A); global function(B); BPSD (C); ADL (D); the incidence of serious adverse events (E). of evidence was judged to be low due to serious RoB and imprecision ( Table 2 ).Subgroups: We performed subgroup analyses to assess Cerebrolysin in VCI.For cognitive function, there were 3 trials, with 404 participants, results revealed a SMD of -0.22 point improvement in favor of Cere- brolysin (95%CI:-0.42 to -0.03; P = 0.03; Fig.4 A).For clinical global impression, 2 trials, with 388 participants, there was improvement in favor of Cerebrolysin OR 2.99 (95%CI:1.02 to 8.73; P = 0.05; Fig.4 B).For BPSD, results from only 1 trial, with 147 participants, suggested no apparent eﬀect, with a SMD of -0.07-point (95%CI:-0.30 to 0.15; P = 0.53; Fig.4 C).For ADL, there were 2 trials, with 379 participants, results suggested a SMD of -0.33 point improvement in favor of Cere- brolysin (95%CI:-0.50 to -0.15; P = 0.0003; Fig.4 D), however there was substantial imprecision in the estimate.
There was apparent increased incidence of SAEs with Cerebrolysin, however there was substantial im- precision in the estimate with only 1 trial, with 240 participants (RR 6.89, 95%CI:0.36 to 131.87; P = 0.20; Fig. 4 E).None of the included trials assessed quality of life or caregiver burden.3.3.2.Actovegin Primary outcome: In one trial, with 503 participants, cognition as- sessed using ADAS-Cog + demonstrated improvement in favor of Actove- gin at 6 months (diﬀerence:-2.3, 95%CI:-3.9 to -0.7; P = 0.005) and 12 months (-3.7, 95%CI:-5.5 to -1.9; P < 0.001).Similarly, using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) there was apparent improvement in fa- vor of Actovegin at 6 months (0.7, 95%CI:0.2 to 1.3; P = 0.013) and 12 months (1.0, 95%CI:0.3 to 1.3; P = 0.003) [8] .Secondary outcomes: Change in clinical global function was assessed using the CGI instrument in one study, 60 participants.
At four weeks, there was an apparent diﬀerence in favor of Cerebrolysin OR 7.4 (95%CI:1.89 to 28.62; P = 0.004) [33] . BPSD was assessed in one study using the SCAG, 58 participants [33] ; and depressive symptoms in one study using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), 503 participants [8] .At four weeks, there was apparent improvement in BPSD in favor of Actovegin (diﬀerence:-10.8; P < 0.01) [33] .However, there was no apparent diﬀerence in depression at 6 and 12 months (Actovegin:60.9 and 62.1%; control:59.5%, and 55.3%, respectively) [8] .None of the in- cluded studies assessed ADL.QoL was assessed using the EQ-5D tool in one trial, 503 participants.The study reported no diﬀerence, at 6 and 12 months [8] .None of the included studies assessed the caregiver burden.Safety: Incidence of SAEs was investigated in one study, 503 partic- ipants.There was no apparent diﬀerence but there was imprecision in the estimate (RR:2.17, 95% CI: 0.90 to 5.23; P = 0.8) [8] .3.3.3.
Cortexin Primary outcome: The included study, 80 participants, used MMSE and MoCA scales. At twelve months, the number of patients with MoCA scores over 26 increased from baseline by 27.5% in favour of Cortexin.Results of MMSE assessment scores were not provided [13] .Secondary outcomes: Clinical global function, BPSD, ADL, QoL and caregiver burden were not assessed.Safety: None of the treated participants reported any AEs or discon- tinuation [13] .4.Discussion Our results suggest potential beneﬁcial eﬀects of animal derived nootropics, but evidence was not strong enough to allow for treatment recommendations or changes to guidelines.For Cerebrolysin there were signiﬁcant improvements in cognitive and global function and the safety proﬁle was reassuring.However, for many reasons these data are not deﬁnitive evidence of the eﬃcacy of Cerebrolysin.
The narrative results also suggest beneﬁcial eﬀects of Actovegin and Cortexin but the strength of evidence was even weaker than Cerebrolysin. Although the quanti- tative data are encouraging, most of the included papers had potential risk of bias issues, reducing the overall strength of evidence.The eﬀects 8 R.A.Alsulaimani and T.J.Quinn Cerebral Circulation - Cognition and Behavior 2 (2021) 100012 on eﬃcacy outcomes were modest and would be regarded by many as smaller than the minimal important clinical diﬀerence.We also note the limited data on duration of beneﬁt beyond the ﬁrst months.In general, the same pattern of potential beneﬁt but no deﬁnitive data was seen when the analyses were restricted to people with VCI.There was a suggestion of possible greater size of cognitive eﬀect of Cerebrolysin in the VCI populations but in contrast to the main anal- ysis, in VCI there was a suggestion of higher incidence of SAEs with Cerebrolysin, albeit this was driven by one trial [14] .
The Actovegin and Cortexin data were primarily based on stroke trials and so could be considered a VCI population. If further trials of nootropics are planned, a VCI focus would seem sensible.Our ﬁndings align with other original research and systematic re- views on nootropics, albeit our review is broader in scope and includes contemporary studies.A previous review that considered Cerebrolysin speciﬁcally for Alzheimer’s disease also found potential beneﬁcial ef- fects although again size of eﬀect was modest [36] .Studies of Cere- brolysin in other neurological conditions are relevant and we note re- cent reviews reporting no clinical beneﬁts in ischemic stroke and vas- cular dementia [ 37 , 38 ], but a suggestion of beneﬁt in traumatic brain injury [39] .For Actovegin and Cortexin, there have been previous non- systematic, narrative reviews describing eﬃcacy and safety, although results in stroke populations have been mixed [ 7 , 40 , 41 ].
It is notable that for both these nootropics there are more reviews than there are original research RCTs. Our review oﬀers an updated, comprehensive systematic search of available literature, using validated search ﬁlters and searching the in- ternational published data.We used new approaches to assessing risk of bias and frame our data using best practice approaches as recommended for guidelines.Despite our comprehensive search, the number of RCTs was limited and this precluded certain analytical approaches, for exam- ple funnel plots for publication bias, were not possible for all nootropics.However, as the certainty of evidence was judged to be low or very low before assessment for publication bias the lack of these analyses is un- likely to inﬂuence results.
Ultimately, our results do not support the recommendation of these drugs in healthcare systems where they are not used, but neither do our results deﬁnitively suggest that these drugs should be withdrawn in those settings where they are commonly used. Factors other than ef- ﬁcacy may need to be considered in the assessment of these drugs.As Cerebrolysin and Actovegin require frequent intravenous infusions there are issues the treatment burden, the economic and the opportunity cost of administration.With limited medium to longer term follow-up data, we do not know how frequently ‘courses’ of these drugs would need to be prescribed.However, given the lack of treatments for vascular and other neurocognitive disorders, some may argue that a modest beneﬁt may be worth the cost.To allow incorporation into guidelines further RCTs are needed.Our GRADE assessment of the published data can inform the design of any future trial.
Contemporary trials would mandate a protocol and report- ing according to best practice, these features were not seen in some of the historical trials included in this review. Future trials should use a standardized dosing regime and collect short, medium- and longer-term data.Outcomes should include health related quality of life and resource use, including need for care-home as these data would be needed for economic modelling.For consistency with other cognitive trials of an in- vestigational medicinal product, caregiver derived outcomes should be considered.Finally, future trials should have a sample size large enough to detect a clinically meaningful diﬀerence in the outcomes of interest.5.Conclusion Despite the extensive use of animal-derived nootropics across inter- national healthcare settings, the current published evidence regarding the eﬃcacy and safety of these drugs in cognitive impairment, includ- ing VCI, is limited.
Although studies assessing animal-derived nootrop- ics suggested a favorable beneﬁt-risk ratio, methodological limitations weaken the strength of evidence. To allow a deﬁnitive recommenda- tion on these agents would require further RCTs using best practice in trial design and reporting, with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods.Supplementary materials Supplementary material associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at doi: 10.1016/j.cccb.2021.100012 .References [1] World Health OrganizationGlobal Action Plan on the Public Health Response to De- mentia 2017 - 2025, WHO, 2017 .[2] A.Wimo , et al., The worldwide costs of dementia 2015 and comparisons with 2010, Alzheimers Dement.13 (1) (2017) 1–7 .[3] M.K.Sun , Potential therapeutics for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, Curr.Neuropharmacol.16 (7) (2018) 1036–1044 .[4] L.Colucci , et al.
