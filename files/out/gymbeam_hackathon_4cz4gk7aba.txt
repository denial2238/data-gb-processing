and characterizing it with hyperthermia, extrapyramidal symp- toms, altered mental status, and autonomic dysfunction.Current knowledge unequivocally shows that NMS most often occurs with the use of first-generation antipsychotics, especially in parenteralform.After the appearance of this disorder, the usual practice is to transfer the patient to monotherapy with clozapine, excluding antipsychotics from the chemical group that led to NMS.However, there are isolated reports of the occurrence of this syn- drome in patients on concomitant therapy of clozapine with lith- ium salts.Objectives: The main objective is to present possible case of NMS in patients with concomitant use of clozapine and lithium Methods: Case report: M.K., born in 1984, graduated from high school, unmarried, without permanent employment.In 2003, afterthe parenteral application of Depo preparation, he developed NMS.
He was hospitalized at the Institute of Psychiatry in Belgrade when he was diagnosed with psychosis of the schizophrenic cycle. Afterdischarge from the hospital, stable clinical remission persists with maintenance therapy with clozapine.In July 2018, after a short stay abroad, he developed a pronounced behavioral disorganization andwas forced to be admitted to our institution.On admission and in the initial phase of hospital treatment, the clinical picture is dominated by intense psychomotor restlessness,acoustic hallucinatory experiences, dysphoric-euphoric mood, anduncontrolled verbal and physical aggression towards medical staff and other patients.
He was treated with clozapine, which was gradually titrated up to 600 mg daily, with benzodiazepine support(lorazepam 10 mg p.d.) without significant improvement, medical sedation, and lithium salts were introduced into the therapeutic protocol.Results: Immediately afterward, psychomotor inhibition occurs, accompanied by somnolence, mild hypotension, sinus tachycardia, and subfebrile temperatures, without signs of muscle stiffness. Lab.analysis of CpK 628, other findings within reference values.Excluded psychopharmaceuticals from the therapeutic protocol, introduced detox.procedures and III generation cephalosporins,after which the patient ’s condition stabilizes.Conclusions: It is important to bare in mind the possibility of NMS in patients with concomitant use of clozapine and lithium Disclosure of Interest: None Declared EPV0828 Treatment of tardive dyskinesias with vitamin E: A case series B.Senol *, F.N.Akarca, R.N.Ekinci and E.

Objectives: In this poster presentation, it was aimed to evaluate the clinical results of the treatment of tardive dyskinesia with high-dose vitamin E in four inpatients with serious mental illness and long- term antipsychotic use. In addition, the treatment of tardive dys-kinesia will be discussed in the light of current literature data.Methods: In the case report, there are three patients with schizo- phrenia and one with mild mental retardation.They were treatedwith 1600 IU of vitamin E per day.The patients continued theirvitamin E treatment for 90 days.
The severity of tardive dyskinesia of the patients was measured by Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS).Results: At the end of the 90 day treatment, the AIMS measure- ments of the subjects decreased 72,7%, 73,3%, 72,2% and 80% respectively.Image: Conclusions: In our clinic, we observed that patients using long- term typical antipsychotics were prescribed antipsychotics in unin- dicated situations or in high doses, patients with high risk fortardive dyskinesia were not taken into consideration when planning treatment, and we encountered cases of tardive dyskinesia despite the widespread use of atypical antipsychotic drugs in hospitalizedpatients. The use of benzodiazepines is restricted especially inelderly individuals due to their side effects and the risk of addiction in long-term use.Although the clinical importance of vitamin E is unknown, it is preferred because it can be used with a low risk ofside effects, considering that it can prolong bleeding time.
Although the results of a review of tardive dyskinesia treatment do not suggest that vitamin E reliably improves tardive dyskinesia symptoms, ourexperience shows that patients benefit from vitamin E treatment. In this regard, there is a need for studies that will be conducted with a large sample and compare the effectiveness of vitamin E with thetreatments known to be effective in tardive dyskinesia.Disclosure of Interest: None Declared S1004 E-Poster Viewing
