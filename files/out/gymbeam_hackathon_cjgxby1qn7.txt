Methods: Fifty male Sprague Dawley rats we re randomly divided into 5 groups of 10 rats each. Group 1 was the control group.The rest of the groups were disease models and were given 0.2% cuprizone w/w to induce MS.After 4 weeks, Group 3 started receiving L-Carnitine, Group 4 was given Coenzyme Q10, and Group 5 received both, while cuprizone poisoning continued.After 12 weeks sucrose preference test and tail suspension test were performed for anhedonia.Rats were euthanized and brains were dissected, and assessed for astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and micro- glial count.Results: A significant increase in oligodendrocyte count, while a reduction in astrocyte and microglial count was seen in the synergistic group ( p ＜ 0.05).Synergism could not be proved in anhedonia.Conclusion: The combination of Coenzyme Q10 and L-Carnitine has a synergistic effect in controlling gliosis in a rat model of MS, but synergism could not be demonstrated on anhedonia.
KEY WORDS: Multiple sclerosis; Cuprizone; Carnitine; Coenzyme Q10; Gliosis. INTRODUCTION Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, that primarily affects the central nervous system (CNS) [1].In 2020, the global prevalence of MS was esti- mated to be 35.9 cases per 100,000 individuals [2].It is mediated by autoreactive lymphocytes that breach the blood-brain barrier and enter the CNS.Once inside, these lymphocytes trigger the activation of astrocytes, and mi-croglia, leading to the secretion of various cytokines, like tumor necrosis factor- , and Interleukins.These cytokines ultimately disrupt the energy production of oligoden-drocytes, at the mitochondrial level.The failure of the Na +/K+ ATPase pump fails to function in the absence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), resulting in sustained Na+ influx, and concomitant Ca+ influx.
This disturbance in ionic balance lays the foundation for the release of pro-teolytic enzymes, that cause oligodendrocyte loss [3]. Glial Response to Injury Oligodendrocyte damage Oligodendrocytes are responsible for wrapping the nerve fibres in the central nervous system and forming myelin sheaths.In MS immune system activation leads to the death of oligodendrocytes, causing a loss of myelin.Demyelination causes serious impairment of the axonal conduction of nerve impulses and adversely affects vari- ous systems [4].Active lesions of MS show a remarkable decrease of oligodendrocytes while necrosis of cells with pyknotic nuclei is very prominent [5].CoQ10 and L-Carnitine ’s Synergistic Effect on Gliosis and Anhedonia 485 Microgliosis Microglia are the resident macrophages of the CNS.They have an important role in maintaining tissue homeo- stasis and contribute to CNS pathology.Demyelinating disorders feature microglial activation.
Microglia undergo profound morphological changes, that are aimed at pro- moting repair [6], but often result in overt inflammation that sustains and propagates the neurodegenerative pro-cess. In active lesions of MS, the number of active micro- glia increases [7].Astrocytosis Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cells present in the human central nervous system [8].They have metabolic, structural, homeostatic, and neuropro- tective functions, and possess a remarkable role in main- taining blood brain barrier (BBB) [9].Astrocyosis indicates neuronal tissue injury and is typi- cally seen in MS lesions.Reactive astrocytes develop in- creased cytoplasmic mass.The cytoplasm contains inter-mediate filaments composed of a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and its expression increases with the acti- vation of reactive astrocytes [10].So, the prototype mark-er to identify astrocytes is the immunohistochemical de- tection of GFAP [11,12].
The hypertrophic astrocytes may themselves sustain substantial damage leading to loss of glial limitans from the basal lamina around blood vessels, further compromising the blood-brain barrier, and in- creasing access of immune cells to the CNS [10]. Anhedonia Anhedonia is the lack of motivation and inability to ex- perience pleasure or interest in previously enjoyable activities.Individuals with MS are known to exhibit anhe- donia, especially during episodes of fatigue [13].It is es-tablished that anhedonia is caused by the inflammatory stimuli [14] affecting the neurotransmitters and neuro- circuits involved in reward processing, including the ven-tral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex [15].Moreover, the circulating proinflammatory cytokines also play a role in the development of mood disturbances trig-gered by stress and major depression [16,17].Cuprizone Model of MS in Rats Cuprizone (CPZ) model is a well-known model used to study Multiple Sclerosis.
CPZ is a selective copper chelat-ing agent, that causes oxidative stress at the mitochondrial level, resulting in oligodendrocyte apoptosis, and even-tually demyelination. Demyelination begins within 2 weeks of CPZ poisoning, and in 5 −6 weeks, the demyeli- nation in some brain regions like the corpus callosum is completed [18].Remyelination starts after 3 −4 weeks of CPZ feeding, while the demyelination continues, and a chronic model is formed after 12 weeks of CPZ, which is not followed by subsequent remyelination [19].At this stage of chronic demyelination, the CPZ model resembles MS in humans, as it also activates glial cells, like as-trocytes and microglia [20].L-Carnitine L-Carnitine is an amino acid and it plays a vital role in energy balance across cell membranes and the energy metabolism of tissues.In humans, it is endogenously syn-thesized in the liver, kidney, and brain from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine.While a major amount is obtained from the diet.
Carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria for their use as a source of energy in beta-oxidation [21]. In patients with MS, L-carnitine is believed to enhance myelination and is clinically used to get relief from muscle fatigue [22].Anti-apoptotic and antioxidant effect of L- Carnitine was previously studied by Zidan et al.[23], Iin a relapsing-remitting model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rats, but they did not comment on astrocytosis.Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is an endogenous lipid.It is mainly synthesized intra- cellularly, while a tiny amount is obtained through food items like fish, whole grains, and organ meat.CoQ10 is involved in the transport of electrons, playing a vital role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
It also serves as a strong lipophilic antioxidant and protects lip-oproteins present in the plasma membrane, and mi- tochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid from oxidative dam- age of free radicals and prevents lipid peroxidation. It can also regenerate and recycle other antioxidants like vita- mins C and E [24].CoQ10 is now considered the third most consumed supplement worldwide [25].Khalilian et al.[19] studied the effect of CoQ10 on remyelination and inflammation 486 T.Qureshi, et al.in the Corpus Callosum in the CPZ model of MS, but they did not mention its effect on astrocytosis.This study was designed to provide the histological evi- dence, of the combined beneficial effect of two anti- oxidants, i.e., L-Carnitine and CoQ10 on the glial re-sponse of the brain, and anhedonia, so they may be pre- scribed together to get more effective symptomatic con- trol in patients of MS.
METHODS Animals For this study, 50 male Sprague Dawley rats, 4 to 6 weeks old [26], weighing 200 to 250 g, were kept in the standard laboratory conditions, with 12-hour cycles of light and dark, room temperature of 23 ± 1°C, and relative humid- ity of 45 ± 1%, in the animal house of the National Institute of Health (NIH) Chak Shehzad Islamabad. All the procedures were performed after approval from the Institutional Research Review Committee, Riphah Inter-national University Ref Riphah/IIMC/IRC/22/3097.Study Design & CPZ Administration CPZ was procured from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd., China.Group 1 was the control group and was given a standard diet.Group 2 served as the disease model of MS and was given CPZ powder 0.2% w/w mixed in chow [27] for 12 weeks.In addition to CPZ, Group 3 received 100 mg/kg/day of L-Carnitine mixed in chow starting from the 5th week.
Group 4 also received CPZ and was supplemented with 150 mg/kg/day of CoQ10 mixed in chow from the 5th week. Group 5, the syner-gistic group, was administered 100 mg/kg/day of L-Carnitine and 150 mg/kg/day of CoQ10 simultaneously from the 5th week onward while concurrently being exposed to CPZ poisoning for the entire 12-week period.Tests for Anhedonia Sucrose preference test Rats were adapted to two similar bottles, containing tap water, three days before the test.On the test day, one bot- tle containing 2% sucrose water, and the other bottle con- taining tap water were put on each cage.The position of the bottles was changed after 12 hours to eliminate side bias [28].After 24 hours, bottles were removed, and the amount of consumed water and sucrose solution was noted.
The percentage of sucrose preference was calcu-lated using the following formula [29]: Sucrose preferance % = Volume of sucrose consumed × 100Volume of sucrose consumed + volume of water consumed Tail suspension test Each rat was taken out of its cage. A piece of tape was applied to the tail, and the rat was suspended with a rod, in a specially designed suspension box, for 6 minutes.The mobility of rats, and their efforts to escape the suspension apparatus were noted.Initially, the movement of rats were escape related.Rats tried to reach the walls of the appara- tus and the suspension bar.All the movements including flexion of trunk, strong shaking of the body, and limb movements mimicking running were counted.Osc illations, pendulum-like swings, and small movements that were only confined to the forelimbs, without the involvement of hind limbs were not counted.The total number of movements was noted for 6 minutes.
After the completion of 6 minutes, rats were freed from the suspension rod and the tape was gently removed. The frequency of move- ments in a minute, was calculated for each rat [30].Tissue Processing After the completion of the 12-week duration of the ex- periment, all the rats were dissected.For gliosis, tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin & eosin [31].For immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated with alcohols, followed by treatment with Hydrogen Peroxide.GFAP primary antibody was then applied, and slides were rinsed with phosphate-buf- fered saline before horse radish peroxidase (HRP) Polymer was added.Subsequently, diaminobenzidine (DAB) was applied, and slides were lightly counterstained with hem- atoxylin stain [32].Slides were analyzed using a light mi-croscope (Olympus), and glial cells were counted in the Corpus Callosum area using the multipoint tool of ImageJ.
Four pictures from different zones of each slide were tak-en, and then the mean was calculated. Statistical Analysis Data were entered and analyzed in the statistical pack- age for social sciences (SPSS version 25; IBM Corp.).CoQ10 and L-Carnitine ’s Synergistic Effect on Gliosis and Anhedonia 487 Table 1.Mean astrocyte count, mean oligodendrocyte count, mean microglial count and result of tail suspension test with standard devia tion GroupA: Astrocyte count (cell/HPF)B: Oligodendrocyte count (cell/HPF)C: Microglial count (cell/HPF)D: Tail suspension test (frequency of movement/min) 1 0.0 ± 0.0 93.4 ± 7.3 0.06 ± 0.08 12.7 ± 1.63 2 17.5 ± 1.71 20.4 ± 1.32 6.4 ± 0.46 10.0 ± 1.49 3 7.3 ± 2.58b40.2 ± 2.24b2.02 ± 0.39b11.1 ± 1.52 4 10.6 ± 1.26a33.1 ± 1.64b3.26 ± 0.51b10.9 ± 1.59 5 4.9 ± 1.59 66.6 ± 25.28 1.26 ± 0.37 11.7 ± 1.33 aSignificant, bHighly significant.Fig.1.Photographs showing reactive astrocytes, in sections of corpus callosum, stained with GFAP (400×).

The CoQ10 group gave a significant difference from the combined group.Comparison of L-Carnitine with the combined group showed highly significant results (Table 1, C).Sucrose Preference Test The Sucrose Preference test showed that Group 1 con- sumed the highest percentage (80%) of Sucrose water, while this percentage was lowest (60%) in Group 2.Group 3 improved the consumption of sucrose water (75%).Improvement with Group 4 was a little less (70%).The combined group could not show a synergistic effect, and improvement in group 5 was equal to group 3 (75%) (Fig.4).Chi-square gave highly significant results ( p ＜ 0.001).Tail Suspension Test The results of the tail suspension test were calculated as the mean frequency of movements per minute.Mean ± SD are given in (Table 1, D).ANOVA was significant ( p ＜ 0.05).
Post-hoc test showed that the comparison between Groups 1 and 2 was significant, while the comparison be- tween all other groups was statistically non-significant (Table 1, D). DISCUSSION In this study, CPZ induced increased expression of GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes, and microglia, as is seen in MS.L-Carnitine and CoQ10 drastically reduced the number of reactive astrocytes and microglia.At the same time, their combination was even more effective, in reducing the astrocyte and microglial count.On the other hand, the oligodendrocyte count which was lowered in the MS model, increased significantly by the use of CoQ10 and L-Carnitine, and their combination had a syn- ergistic effect in raising the oligodendrocyte count.MS is believed to cause oxidative damage at the mi- CoQ10 and L-Carnitine ’s Synergistic Effect on Gliosis and Anhedonia 489 Fig.3.Photographs showing micro- glia (arrow), in H&E-stained coro- nal sections of corpus callosum at 400×.

Oxidative damage and changes in BBB are the other mechanisms contributing to neuronal damage. Although early pathological events in MS are thought to be due to the loss of supportive functions of as-trocytes, later on, activation of astrocytes is the main fac- tor leading to axonal loss.Microglial activation aggravates demyelination and axonal damage.L-carnitine and 490 T.Qureshi, et al.Fig.6.Bar chart showing a comparison of mean glial cell count in all the groups.CoQ10, both maintain an effic ient supply of ATP from mi- tochondria, preventing the oligodendroglia from oxida- tive insult, reducing demyelination, and minimizing the astrocytic and microglial response (Fig.4).Ghosh et al.[33] studied the neuroprotective effects of various antioxidants on astrocytosis on the optic nerve head, by assessing the levels of oxidative enzymes.Barati et al.
[20] showed a significant reduction in astrocytosis by transplanting mesenchymal stem cells in rat brains, al-though their practical use in patients is still debatable. The improvement in oligodendrocyte count is due to the protective effect of CoQ10 and L-Carnitine at the mi-tochondrial level that reduces oxidative stress, and neuro- inflammation, caused by CPZ.Sharma et al.[34] showed the neuroprotective effect of CoQ10 on oligodendrocyte apoptosis in a rat model of MS.L-Carnitine was also bene- ficial in preserving the oligodendrocyte count, according to a study by Zidan et al.[23].Microglia are the macrophages of CNS, that get acti- vated, at the time of injury.They phagocytose myelin de-bris and release a variety of cytokines and growth factors [6].Activated microglia were more numerous in disease models, while CoQ10 and L-carnitine reduced their numbers, showing a damage reduction.
The reduction in microglial count is more evident in Group 5, which re- ceived CoQ10 and L-carnitine simultaneously. Singh et al.[35] showed that L-carnitine prevented neuronal loss, by attenuating the activation of microglia.Pradhan et al.[24], documented similar results on microglia, with CoQ10.The incidence of anhedonia in patients of MS is much higher than normal population [36].After CPZ poisoning, rats exhibited depression-like behavioral changes, and anhedonia, as the urge to consume sucrose water was decreased.Animal models of MS are known to trigger be- havioral changes by activation of the inflammatory im-mune system, causing a release of various proinflam- matory cytokines.This is followed by a cascade of events, including neuroinflammation, neuroendocrine changes and decreased neurotrophic factors, resulting in anhedo- nia and depression [29].Clinically, rats are said to have anhedonia, when sucrose consumption is less than 65%, as seen in Group 2.
These changes were improved when CoQ10 and L-carnitine were administered in individual groups, and a similar effect was seen when both agents were combined (Fig. 4).Synergistic effect of CoQ10 and L-carnitine could not be determined on behavioural symptoms, using sucrose preference test.The authors rec- ommend a trial of different dose combinations and use of other behavioural tests to predict anhedonia.Previously, Ershadi and Hosseini [37], documented that CoQ10 re- versed stress-induced anhedonia, in rats.Nilofer Noorie [38], showed the neuroprotective effect of L-carnitine against acute stress-induced depression.Nie et al.[39], also proved the beneficial role of L-Carnitine on major de- pressive disorder.In the tail suspension test, the efforts of rats in the CPZ Group were slightly reduced, demonstrated by less fre-quent movements, when suspended with their tails tied to a stand.
The MS is believed to induce depression-like changes in patients, mainly due to myelin pathology, and the same effect is also seen in some animal studies, using CPZ. In the present study, there was an improvement with CoQ10 and L-Carnitine, and when combined, both agents improved the urge to struggle, showing a decrease in an- hedonia, in rats (Table 1).Post-hoc test showed non-sig- nificant comparison among different groups, demonstrat-ing that the study was not effective in bringing out changes in the mobility of rats.The results differ from Khalilian et al.[19], in which CPZ failed to cause any difference in mobility when compared with the normal group.In conclusion, this study concluded that combining CoQ10 and L-Carnitine can provide a better recovery from the symptoms of MS, as compared to individual agents, by controlling the glial response and by increasing the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes (Fig.6).
The synergistic effect of two agents on anhedonia could not be proven by this study.
