Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 2 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Summary Under the framework of Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, the European Commission requested EFSA to conduct an assessment of the biological risks to animal and public health deriving from the use as organic fertilisers and soil improvers (OF/SI) of the following Category 2 and 3 materials and derived products: biogas digestion residues and compost; ash derived from incineration,co-incineration and combustion; glycerine and other products of materials derived from the productionof biodiesel and renewable fuels; pet food; feed and dog chews; hides and skins; wool and hair;feather and downs; and pig bristles.
Following the clari ﬁcation of the Terms of Reference (ToR), the European Commission requested EFSA to assess the requirements for alternative transformation parameters for biogas and compostingplants in terms of the validation of the intended process, referred to in point 1, Section 2, Chapter III, Annex V of Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011, when applied to the following eight groups of Category 2 and Category 3 materials and derived products processed or obtained in accordance withRegulation (EC) No 1069/2009 and Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 for the declaration ofthe end points in the manufacturing chain and the standard or alternative methods approved for thispurpose: (1) ash derived from incineration, co-incineration and combustion; (2) glycerine derived fromthe production of biodiesel and renewable fuels; (3) other materials derived from the production ofbiodiesel and renewable fuels; (4) hides and skins; (5) wool and hair; (6) feathers and down; (7) pigbristles; and (8) horns, horn products, hooves and hoof products.
Point 1 of Section 2 of Chapter III of Annex V of Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 states that the validation of the intended process must demonstrate that the process achieves the followingoverall risk reduction: for thermal and chemical processes, a reduction of 5 log 10ofEnterococcus faecalis orSalmonella Senftenberg (775W, H 2S negative), and a reduction in the infectivity titre of thermoresistant viruses such as parvovirus by at least 3 log 10, whenever they are identi ﬁed as a relevant hazard; and as regards chemical processes also a reduction of resistant parasites such aseggs of Ascaris sp. by at least 99.9% (3 log 10) of viable stages.The parameters of the processes were extracted from Annex III, Annex IV and Annex XIII of Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011.
In the materials for which processing time was not clearly stated in the legislation (group 5 –wool and hair, and group 7 –pig bristles), two plausible scenarios were explored: 5 min and 60 min (covered in assessment question 1 (AQ1) (see Protocol in Annex A). An extensive literature search was conducted to identify viral hazards for humans and animals thathave been isolated in the eight groups of materials included in the mandate.Hazards intrinsicallypresent in the matrix were considered, while hazards deriving from external sources or cross-contamination were excluded from the hazard identi ﬁcation (AQ3).Parvoviridae were considered, as a worse-case scenario, when no intrinsic viral hazards were identi ﬁed.Extensive literature searches were conducted to extract data from the scienti ﬁc literature about thermal and/or chemical inactivation of E.faecalis ,S.Senftenberg (AQ2), the selected viruses (non-enveloped viruses) (AQ4) and eggs of Ascaris sp.
(AQ5) For each of the assessment questions (AQ), a body of evidence was built by summarising the data extracted from the literature on thermal and chemical inactivation of the indicator microorganisms andbiological hazards for each of the materials and derived products listed in the ToR, and the existinguncertainties. Using this body of evidence, an expert knowledge elicitation procedure was performedinvolving eight experts (six Working Group members and two EFSA staff) who answered the following questions: (a) What is the probability that a 5 log 10reduction of E.faecalis is achieved in more than 99% of cases, by application of the relevant process/es, assuming that the process/es is/areperformed as prescribed and that the indicated process conditions are achieved?
(b) What is theprobability that a 5 log 10reduction of S.Senftenberg (775 W, H 2S negative) is achieved in more than 99% of cases, by application of the relevant process/es, assuming that the process/es is/areperformed as prescribed and that the indicated process conditions are achieved? (c) What is theprobability that a 3 log 10reduction of Parvovirus or the identi ﬁed most resistant viruses is achieved in more than 99% of cases, by application of the relevant process/es, assuming that the process/es is/are performed as prescribed and that the indicated process conditions are achieved?(d) What is the probability that a 3 log 10reduction of eggs of Ascaris sp.is achieved in more than 99% of the cases, by application of the relevant chemical process/es, assuming that the process/es is/are performed asprescribed and that the indicated process conditions are achieved?
To answer these questions, ﬁrst, subjective probability ranges were provided by each of the individual experts for the 52 different combinations of materials and derived products, processes andInactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 3 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 indicator microorganisms and biological hazards. Second, after an open discussion, a single consensus probability range was obtained for each combination, based on the estimates provided by theindividual experts.These consensus probability ranges are considered to best represent theuncertainty on whether the indicated log 10reductions are achieved by the standard processes for the different materials.
The probability ranges for the most resistant indicator microorganisms andbiological hazards were selected as the worst-case scenario to describe the uncertainty around theoverall ef ﬁcacy of the standard or alternative transformation processes for animal by-products (ABP) declaration of end points or placement in the market, de ﬁned by time/temperature/pH parameters. The certainty that, at least in 99% of cases, the transformation processes as de ﬁned in the legislation, or in the scenarios agreed by the Working Group, are able to reduce the indicatormicroorganisms and biological hazards to the required extent, was judged to be as follows: 1) Ash derived from incineration, co-incineration and combustion: 99 –100% for both 850 °C, > 2 s and 1,100 °C, > 0.2 s ( E.
faecalis ,S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ); 2) Glycerine derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels: 98 –100% for Category 2 material subjected to Method 1 at 133 °C, 20 min, 3 bar, followed by esteri ﬁcation and transesteri ﬁcation ( E. faecalis ,S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ); 90 –95% and 90 –99% for Category 3 material subjected to 80 °C for 120 min and 100 °C for 60 min, followed by transesteri ﬁcation, respectively ( Parvoviridae ).Since method 5 must ensure that the two time –temperature combinations are met, even if they were assessed separately, for Category 3 material it is considered at least 90 –99% certain that the transformation process is able to reduce, to the required extent, Parvoviridae , the most resistant of the three indicator microorganisms ( E.faecalis, S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ).
3) Other materials derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels: 90 –99% for Category 2 material subjected to Method 1 at 133 °C, 20 min, 3 bar ( E. faecalis , S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ); and 33 –90% and 66 –90% for Category 3 material subjected to 80 °C for 120 min and 100 °C for 60 min, respectively ( Parvoviridae ).Since method 5 must ensure that the two time –temperature combinations are met, even if they were assessed separately, for Category 3 material, it is considered at least 66 –90% certain that the transformation process is able to reduce, to the required extent, Parvoviridae , the most resistant of the three indicator microorganisms ( E.faecalis, S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ).
4) Hides and skins: 10 –66% and 33 –66% for pH 12 –13 for 8 h, and pH 12 for > 8 h followed by pH < 3 for 16 h, respectively (eggs of Ascaris sp.); 5) Wool and hair: 1 –33% and 10 –50% for pH > 12 –13, applied for 5 or 60 min, respectively (eggs of Ascaris sp.); 6) Feathers and down: 66 –90% for 100 °C for at least 30 min ( Anelloviridae andCircoviridae ); 7) Pig bristles: 33 –66% and 50 –95% for 100 °C, applied for 5 or 60 min, respectively (Parvoviridae ); 8) Horns, horn products, hooves and hoof products: 66 –95% for 80 °C for 60 min ( E. faecalis and S.Senftenberg).In order to reduce the uncertainty of the assessment, it is recommended to generate data on the occurrence of biological hazards, the intrinsic physico-chemical properties (e.g.
pH, water activity(a w)), and on the thermal and non-thermal (chemical) inactivation of the indicator microorganisms in ABP matrices.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 4 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Table of contents Abstract ............................................................................................................................... ..................1 Summary ...............................................................................................................................................3 1.Introduction ...............................................................................................................................7 1.1.Background and Terms of Reference as provided by the requestor .................................................7 1.2.

111Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 6 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 1. Introduction 1.1.Background and Terms of Reference as provided by the requestor Derived products referred to in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1069/20091that have reached the end point in the manufacturing chain of animal by-products may subsequently be placed on the market without restrictions under this Regulation and shall no longer be subject to of ﬁcial controls in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 and Regulation (EU) 2017/6252.Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 provides rules for placing on the market and use of organic fertilisers and soil improvers (OF/SI) of Category 2 and 3 materials.By the exclusion ofCategory 1 material from the production of OF/SI certain risks to animal and public health and to theenvironment are already addressed.
However, for the use of those animal by-products, which areclassi ﬁed as Category 2 material referred to in Article 9(c), a speci ﬁc risk assessment is necessary to ensure that the use of such animal by-products as organic fertiliser does not entail a risk to animal and public health and to the environment. Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 3establishing rules for the placing on the market of EU fertilising products, introduced in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 a reference to Article 32 of thatRegulation, and thus the possibility to determine the end point in the manufacturing chain of OF/SI.4 Derived products of Category 2 and Category 3 materials,5referred to respectively in Articles 9 and 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009, may be placed on the market and used as OF/SI.Thosematerials present comparable TSE/BSE risks since none of them includes speci ﬁc risk materials as deﬁned in Article 3(1)(g) of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 6.
The European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to initiate an assessment of derived products referred to in Article 32 that are already widely used in the Union as OF/SI. This assessment shall cover at least the following products: meat meal, bone meal, meat-and-bone meal, hydrolysed proteins of Category 3 materials, processed manure, compost, biogas digestion residues, feather meal, glycerine and other products of Category 2 or 3 materials derived from the production of biodiesel and renewablefuels, pet food, feed and dog chews that have been refused for commercial reasons or technicalfailures, derived products from blood of animals, hides and skins, hoofs and horns, guano of bats andbirds, wool and hair, feather and downs, and pig bristles.The following derived products are widely placed on the market for use as OF/SI: 1) Biogas digestion residues and compost referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 32 (1) of Regulation (EC) No.1069/2009.
Standard transformation parameters for compost and biogas transformation residues are laid down in Section 1 of Chapter III of Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 7. With reference to point 2(a) of Section 1 and point 2(b) of Section 2 of Chapter II of the aforementioned Annex V, Category 2 materials intended forcompost or biogas transformation should be processed in accordance with processing 1Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 laying down health rules as regards animal by-products and derived products not intended for human consumption and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 (Animal by-products Regulation, OJ L 300, 14.11.2009, p.1).

Biogas and compost transformation has been subject to several EFSA assessments in 20058; 20099and 201510 2) Ash derived from incineration, co-incineration and combustion, carried out in accordance with methods laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 142/2011, of Category 2 and 3materials and derived products may be used as fertilising products. The disposal of animalby-products, including meat-and-bone meal, by incineration, co-incineration and combustionhas been subject to EFSA assessment on several occasions.
The following scienti ﬁc opinions led to the conclusion that direct incineration of carcasses and incineration or burning under appropriate controlled condition of rendered material are economically feasible technologies for safe disposal of TSE risk material: Overview of the BSE risk assessments of the European Commission ’s Scienti ﬁc Steering Committee (SSC) and its TSE/BSE ad hoc Group11; Opinion on open burning of potentially TSE-infected animal materials adopted by theScienti ﬁc Steering Committee at its meeting of 16-17 January 2003 12; Opinion on the use of small incinerators for BSE risk reduction by the Scienti ﬁc Steering Committee meeting of 16-17 January 200313; and Opinion of the Scienti ﬁc Panel on Biological Hazards of the European Food Safety Authority on the “Quantitative risk assessment of the animal BSE risk posed by meat and bone meal with respect to the residual BSE risk ”.14 Based on those scienti ﬁc opinions, standards for the disposal of animal by-products as waste by incineration, the disposal or recovery by co-incineration and the use as a fuel for combustion havebeen laid down in Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 15.
3) Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 sets out end points for certain Category 2 and 3 materials which may be used in the manufacturing of OF/SI, such as derived productsreferred to in points (b) to (h) or side product of biofuel and oleochemical productionreferred to in points (a), (i), (j) and (k) of that Article. Certain end points have been determined based on EFSA assessments of 2004, 162010,17201118 and 2015.19 Terms of Reference In the light of the above, and in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 178/200220, the Commission requests EFSA to provide a scienti ﬁc opinion concerning the capacity of certain speci ﬁc processing or transformation methods used in the production of organic fertilisers and soil improvers(OF/SI) in view of determining the endpoints in the manufacturing chain of CE-marked EU fertilisingproducts.
In particular, the scienti ﬁc opinion should comprise an assessment of the biological risks to animal and public health deriving from the use as OF/SI of the following Category 2 and 3 materials andderived products processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 and Regulation (EU) No 142/2011: 1) biogas digestion residues and compost; 2) ash derived from incineration, co-incineration and combustion; 8EFSA Journal 2005; 264:1 –21. 9EFSA Journal 2009; 7(11):1370.10EFSA Journal 2015; 13(11):4306.11https://ec.europa.eu/food/system/ ﬁles/2020-12/sci-com_ssc_out364_en.pdf 12https://ec.europa.eu/food/system/ ﬁles/2020-12/sci-com_ssc_out310_en.pdf 13https://ec.europa.eu/food/system/ ﬁles/2020-12/sci-com_ssc_out311_en.pdf 14EFSA Journal 2005:257:1 –30.15Article 6 of and Annex III to Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011.16EFSA Journal 2004; 23:1 –3.17EFSA Journal 2010; 8(12):1934.18EFSA Journal 2011; 9(2):1976.19EFSA Journal 2015; 13(11):4307.

Interpretation of the Terms of Reference As a result of discussions conducted with the requestor, on 25 January 2021, the European Commission indicated to EFSA that the Terms of Reference (ToR) are clari ﬁed as follows: ‘EFSA is requested to assess the requirements for alternative transformation parameters for biogas and composting plants in terms of the validation of the intended process, referred to in point 1 of Section 2of Chapter III of Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 142/2011, when applied to other derived products.
In particular, the scienti ﬁc opinion should comprise an assessment of the following Category 2 and 3 materials and derived products processed or obtained in accordance with Regulation (EC) No1069/2009 and Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 for the declaration of the end points in themanufacturing chain and the standard or alternative methods approved for this purpose: 1) ash derived from incineration, co-incineration and combustion; 2) glycerine derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels;3)other materials derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels; 4) hides and skins;5) wool and hair;6) feather and downs; 7) pig bristles; 8) horns, horn products, hoofs and hoof products.
’ The requestor clari ﬁed that only the transformation processes included in Commission Regulation (EU) 142/2011 for the declaration of the end points in the manufacturing chain (for raw materials) and the approved standard or alternative methods to produce derived products should be considered,disregarding the further transformation processes, the fertiliser industry might apply to produce theﬁnal OF/SI, and without considering the use or applications of the ﬁnal OF/SI product. It was also conﬁrmed that only materials produced in the EU should be considered, as all imported materials from non-EU countries will have to comply with the EU legislation.The requestor also provided an updatedlist of Category 2 and 3 animal by-products (ABP) and derived materials that should be included in theassessment.Based on this clari ﬁcation, biogas digestion residues (digestate) and compost, pet food, feed and dog chews, initially included in the ToR, were excluded from the assessment.
A new ABP group, horns,horn products, hooves and hoof products, was added. Thus, it was requested to assess for the list of materials included in the ToR if: (i) the transformation processes for the declaration of the end points in the manufacturing chain or (ii) thestandard or alternative methods for the production of ABP derived products meet the requirements foralternative transformation parameters for biogas and composting plants in terms of the validation ofthe intended process, referred to in point 1 of Section 2 of Chapter III of Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 142/2011.It is important to emphasise that, as a result of the new request from the European Commission, the output of the scienti ﬁc opinion was not a full risk assessment, but consisted of the estimation of the level of inactivation/reduction of concentration of biological hazards and indicator microorganismsof interest after the processing methods and standard or alternative methods are applied.
Thus, theoutput of the assessment did not conclude on any relationship between the presence of hazards andthe risks to human or animal health of the OF/SI containing them. Moreover, the output of thisscienti ﬁc opinion comprises an evaluation of certain processes applied to produce or transform a list of materials that can be further processed, in the form of composting or any other method, and used as an OF/SI.
As some of the materials in the list of the ToR include multiple substrates/matrices, it was agreed to use throughout the opinion the term ‘group ’followed by a number in the order of the ToR for each ofInactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 9 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 the eight items included in it, as follows: group 1: ash derived from incineration, co-incineration and combustion; group 2: glycerine derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels; group 3:other materials derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels; group 4: hides andskins; group 5: wool and hair; group 6: feathers and down; group 7: pig bristles; and group 8: horns,horn products, hooves and hoof products.
The materials in the groups included in the mandate are of two very different natures: some of them are residues or derived materials produced during the treatment of raw ABP with approvedstandard or alternative methods (Groups 1, 2, 3); and others are raw ABP (Groups 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). In the former, the parameters of the standard or alternative methods will be applied, whereas in the latter, the parameters of the treatments required for the declaration of end points (Groups 4, 5 and 6)or the treatments for movement of the material between regions (Group 7) or for the placing on themarket (Group 8) will be assessed.These differences will have an impact on the hazard identi ﬁcation conducted for each type of materials (see Section 3).1.2.1.
Background legislation and approach to answer the ToR Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011, in Section 1, Chapter III, Annex V, details the minimum requirements of Category 3 ABP to be used as raw materials in a biogas or compost plant, as follows: a) maximum particle size before entering the unit or the composting reactor: 12 mm; b) minimum temperature in all material in the unit or in the reactor: 70 °C; and c) minimum time in the unit without interruption: 60 min. Section 2.1 of the same Chapter describes the alternative transformation parameters for biogas and composting plants.According to it, the competent authority may authorise the use of parameters other than the parameters set out in point 1 of Section 1 of Chapter I and other than the standardtransformation parameters, provided that the method is demonstrated to be at least as safe as thestandard method.
That demonstration shall include a validation, which shall be carried out inaccordance with the following requirements: a) Identi ﬁcation and analysis of possible hazards, including the impact of input material, based on a full description of the transformation conditions and parameters; b) A risk assessment, which evaluates how the speci ﬁc transformation conditions referred to in point (a) are achieved in practice under normal and atypical situations; c) Validation of the intended process by measuring the reduction of viability/infectivity of: i) endogenous indicator organisms during the process, where the indicator is: —consistently present in the raw material in high numbers, —not less heat resistant to the lethal aspects of the transformation process, but also not signi ﬁcantly more resistant than the pathogens for which it is being used to monitor , —relatively easy to quantify and to identify and to con ﬁrm; or ii) a well-characterised test organism or virus, during exposure, introduced in a suitable test body into the starting material.
d) The validation of the intended process referred to in point (c) must demonstrate that the process achieves the following overall risk reduction: i) for thermal and chemical processes by: —a reduction of 5 log 10of Enterococcus faecalis or Salmonella Senftenberg (775W, H 2S negative), —reduction of infectivity titre of thermoresistant viruses such as parvovirus by at least 3 log 10, whenever they are identi ﬁed as a relevant hazard; and ii) as regards chemical processes also by: —a reduction of resistant parasites such as eggs of Ascaris sp.
by at least 99,9% (3 log 10) of viable stages; e) Designing a complete control programme including procedures for monitoring the functioning of the process referred to in point (c);Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 10 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 f) Measures ensuring continuous monitoring and supervision of the relevant process parameters ﬁxed in the control programme when operating the plant. Details on the relevant process parameters used in a biogas or composting plant as well as other critical control points must be recorded and maintained so that the owner, operator or their representative and the competent authority can monitor the operation of the plant.Records must be made available by the operator to the competent authority on request.Information relating to a process authorised under this point must be made available to the Commission on request.
Taking into account the content of this EU Regulation, an assessment was undertaken to determine if the processing standards for the declaration of the end points in the manufacturing chain or thestandard or alternative methods approved for the production of derived products from the ABP in the list of materials mentioned in Section 1.2achieve: (i) a reduction of 5 log 10ofEnterococcus faecalis or Salmonella Senftenberg (775W, H 2S negative) and a reduction of infectivity titre by at least 3 log 10of those thermoresistant viruses that are identi ﬁed as a relevant hazard, and, in the case of chemical processes, also a reduction of eggs of Ascaris sp. by 3 log 10.
This was achieved by addressing the following assessment questions (AQ): AQ1 : What are the technical parameters of the transformation processes for the declaration of the end points in the manufacturing chain, and the standard or alternative methods approved to producederived materials or residues as described in the legislation (Commission Regulation (EU) 142/2011) ofthe Category 2 and 3 materials and derived products as de ﬁned in the mandate? AQ2 : Is the 5 log 10reduction of the indicator microorganisms Enterococcus faecalis (EF) or Salmonella Senftenberg (SS) achieved for each of the Category 2 and 3 materials and derived products, as de ﬁned in the clari ﬁcation of the mandate, by the technical parameters identi ﬁed in AQ1?AQ3 : Which viral hazards can be intrinsically found in the Category 2 and 3 materials and derived products as de ﬁned in the clari ﬁcation of the mandate?
AQ4 : Is the 3 log 10reduction of the selected thermoresistant viruses identi ﬁed in AQ3 achieved for each of the Category 2 and 3 materials and derived products, as de ﬁned in the clari ﬁcation of the mandate, by the technical parameters identi ﬁed in AQ1? AQ5 : Is the 3 log 10reduction of eggs of Ascaris sp.achieved for each of the Category 2 and 3 materials and derived products, as de ﬁned in the clari ﬁcation of the mandate, by the technical parameters identi ﬁed in AQ1 for the processes based on chemical treatments (group 4 –hides and skins; group 5 –wool and hair)?2.Data and methodologies 2.1.
Parameters of the transformation processes (AQ1) Two methods were applied to ascertain technical parameters of the transformation processes for the declaration of the end points in the manufacturing chain, and the standard or alternative methods as described in the legislation for the groups of materials de ﬁned in the mandate: For materials for which details of the technical parameters of the transformation processes are explicit in the legislation: Annexes III, IV and XIII of Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 were reviewed. For materials for which details of the technical parameters of the transformation processes are not explicit in the legislation: two plausible scenarios (5 min and 60 min) were assessed.In cases where the technical parameters were explicitly de ﬁned in the legislation, they were used as reference parameters for the assessment.
When they were not explicitly de ﬁned, the uncertainty associated with the interpretation of the legislation was taken into account and described. Theselected technical parameters are presented in Section 3and applied in the expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) by producing 52 combinations of processes, materials and hazards.2.2.Viral hazards identi ﬁcation (AQ3) To identify viral hazards for humans and animals that can be found intrinsically in the Category 2 and 3 materials and derived products as de ﬁned in the list of materials provided in the clari ﬁcation of the mandate, an extensive literature search was conducted.The selection of studies was based onInactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 11 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 experimental or observational studies in which the viral species, genus or family are mentioned in relation to the materials included in the mandate (raw materials).
The database used was Scopus,Elsevier (English language, worldwide and not restricted in years). The search strings were designedby combining the biological hazards (virus), the matrix (material as in the mandate) and ABP.Thelatter group of terms was added to reduce the number of false-positive hits.The search strings aredisplayed in Table A.2in Annex A.A table with the identi ﬁed viral hazards was produced with the following ﬁelds: material (Category 2 and 3 material or derived product), characteristics (non- enveloped, DNA/RNA), family of the viral hazard, viral hazard, (main) species affected and reference/s (see Table 4in Section 3.5).2.3.Thermal and chemical inactivation (AQ2, AQ4, AQ5) An extensive literature search was conducted to extract data from the scienti ﬁc literature on thermal and chemical inactivation of E.faecalis and S.Senftenberg in the form of time/temperature/pH combinations in de ﬁned matrices (even if different from those in the mandate).
Data on chemical inactivation of S. Senftenberg were extracted from this extensive literature review, whereas data on thermal inactivation of this bacteria were extracted from the review of studies on the thermalresistance of salmonellae executed by Doyle and Mazzotta (2000).An extensive literature search was conducted to extract data from the scienti ﬁc literature on thermal and chemical inactivation of the selected viruses in the form of time/temperature/pH combinations in de ﬁned matrices (even if different from the ones in the mandate).Out of the virus identi ﬁed as hazards in the extensive literature search (ELS) described in Section 2.2to address AQ3, only non-enveloped viruses that may be intrinsically present in the materials were selected as the mostresistant to thermal and other treatments for each group.An ELS was conducted to extract data from the scienti ﬁc literature on chemical inactivation of Ascaris spp.
in the form of time/temperature/pH combinations in de ﬁned matrices (even if different from those in the mandate). The description of these three ELS is detailed below.The criterion for selection of references was experimental studies in which resistance parameters (D- and/or Z-values) or the levels of reduction or inactivation of the selected bacteria, viruses orparasites (preferably measured in log 10) had been measured after thermal and/or chemical treatment in matrices preferably similar to the ones included in the mandate.The database used was Scopus,Elsevier (English language, worldwide and not restricted in years).The search strings were designed by combining the generic names of biological hazards (selected bacteria, viruses or parasites) AND (inactivation method) AND inactivation.
The criteria for inclusion were if in the title, abstract or keywords, the speci ﬁc name of the hazard (indicator microorganism or biological hazard) and inactivation/resistance keywords were mentioned. Details of the search stringscan be found in Table A.1of Annex A.The selection of studies was made by screening the title and abstract of the references extracted following the application of the search strings.The list of references was presented in tabular format ina template containing the following ﬁelds: Authors, Title, Year, DOI, Link and Abstract.The list of references for each indicator microorganism or biological hazard was screened by WG members andEFSA staff.For each reference, one of the following three options was assigned: ‘Yes ’, when it was possible to extract inactivation data by looking at the paper in full; ‘Doubtful ’, when it may be useful in a second round to look more in depth; ‘No’when the reference was to be discarded.
References in category Yes were retrieved and full papers were reviewed, splitting them into two groups: those with/without relevant data to be extracted. Data from papers with relevant data were transferred to atabular template including the preselected set of ﬁelds.Review of doubtful references was left at the discretion of the reviewer.Data extracted on thermal inactivation were presented in tabular format using a template with the following ﬁelds: hazard (virus, etc.), matrix/substrate, initial load, treatment, temperature ( °C), time (min), level of inactivation, D-value (min) and reference.Data extracted on chemical inactivation were presented in tabular format using a template with the following ﬁelds: matrix/substrate, indicator microorganism/biological hazard, initial load, treatment, level of inactivation and reference.
The data obtained from the literature were considered by the WG to evaluate, using EKE, the certainty on whether the required level of reduction is achieved for the indicator microorganisms and/or biological hazards by the standard processing parameters identi ﬁed in AQ1 and for each of the materials.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 12 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 2.4. Uncertainty analysis and expert knowledge elicitation Based on the EFSA guidance on Uncertainty Analysis in Scienti ﬁc Assessments (EFSA Scienti ﬁc Committee, 2018a) and the scienti ﬁc opinion on the principles and methods behind EFSA ’s Guidance on Uncertainty Analysis in Scienti ﬁc Assessment (EFSA Scienti ﬁc Committee, 2018b), the sources of uncertainty associated with the available data were summarised in tabular format (Table 12in Section 4), describing also the cause of the uncertainty.
The impact of the uncertainty on the level of inactivation of the selected indicator microorganisms and biological hazards was described, withoutspecifying in which of the combinations of material, process and hazard, the over-/underestimationwould occur. An EKE was performed to answer AQ2, AQ4 and AQ5, based on the collected evidence and indicated uncertainties.The EKE questions were speci ﬁed as follows: What is the probability that a 5 log 10reduction of E.faecalis is achieved, in more than 99% of cases, by application of the relevant process/es, assuming that the process(es) is/areperformed as prescribed and that the indicated process conditions are achieved?What is the probability that a 5 log 10reduction of S.Senftenberg (775W, H 2S negative) is achieved, in more than 99% of cases, by application of the relevant process/es, assuming that the process/es is/are performed as prescribed and that the indicated process conditions are achieved?
What is the probability that a 3 log 10reduction of parvovirus or the identi ﬁed most resistant viruses is achieved, in more than 99% of cases, by application of the relevant process/es,assuming that the process/es is/are performed as prescribed and that the indicated processconditions are achieved? What is the probability that a 3 log 10reduction of eggs of Ascaris sp.is achieved, in more than 99% of cases, by application of the relevant chemical process/es, assuming that the process/es is/are performed as prescribed and that the indicated process conditions are achieved?In these questions, the phrase ‘in more than 99% of cases ’refers to the potential variation in the performance of the relevant process/es.As the process/es is/are well de ﬁned, this variation is considered to be small.The ‘probability ’refers to the certainty that the log 10reduction is achieved if this well-de ﬁned process is performed.
The EKE consisted of two steps: individual judgements and consensus judgements. In Step 1, the experts provided individual judgements for each of the 52 combinations of material/process/hazard byconsidering them separately, taking into account the version of the draft opinion at the beginning ofthe process with the raw data on thermal and chemical inactivation of the indicators, the description ofthe processes, the integration of the evidence and the uncertainty table, as well as the personalexpertise and assessment of the uncertainties involved.In Step 2, during an open session, the experts were asked to consider what a rational impartial observer (RIO) would judge, having considered the evidence, uncertainties, the individual judgements and having heard the discussion maintained by theexperts.
As the starting point for the discussions, a potential consensus probability range wasproposed by the facilitator, based on the mean of the median estimates of all the individual ranges.The objective of Step 2 was to reach consensus on the probability ranges that were considered to bestrepresent the uncertainty on whether the indicated log 10reductions are achieved with the standard processes for the different materials. Detailed information on the EKE can be found in Appendix Cand in Table A.1of Annex A.3.Assessment 3.1.Introduction 3.1.2.
Category 2 and 3 animal by-products and derived products Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 de ﬁnes ‘animal by-products ’as ‘entire bodies or parts of animals, products of animal origin or other products obtained from animals, which are not intended for humanconsumption, including oocytes, embryos and semen; and ‘derived products ’as products obtained from one or more treatments, transformations or steps of processing of animal by-products .’ The use or fate of ABP depends on their risk classi ﬁcation in three different categories: (i) Category 1 material consists mainly of material that is considered at transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE)Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 13 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 risk, and as such represents the highest risk material; (ii) category 2 material includes fallen stock, manure and gastrointestinal contents; (iii) Category 3 materials are considered of a lower risk level andinclude parts of animals that have been considered ﬁt for human consumption at the slaughterhouse, but that are not intended for human consumption for production or commercial reasons (e.g.

3.1.2. End points in the manufacturing chain Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) 1069/2009 states that: ‘for derived products referred to in articles 32 (organic fertilisers and soil improvers), 35 (pet food) and 36 (other derived products), which no longerpose any signi ﬁcant risk to public or animal health, an end point in the manufacturing chain may be determined, beyond which they are no longer subject to the requirements of this Regulation ’.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 15 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Article 32 refers to organic fertilisers and soil improvers which may be placed on the market and used under certain conditions.In addition, digestate, the by-product from thetransformation of food waste, sludge, animal slurry, grease-trap waste, etc.into biogas orcompost may be placed on the market and used as organic fertiliser or soil improver.
Article 35 refers to pet food under certain conditions. Article 36 refers to other derived products than the products referred to in Articles 31, 32, 33and 35.Those derived products may subsequently be placed on the market withoutrestrictions under Regulation (EC) 1069/2009 and shall no longer be subject to of ﬁcial controls in accordance with Regulation (EC) 1069/2009.The legal context of this mandate is speci ﬁed in point 4 of Article 5, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/1009, which states that: ‘within six months after 15 July 2019, the Commission shall initiate aﬁrst assessment of derived products referred to in Article 32 that are already widely used in the Union as organic fertilisers and soil improvers.
This assessment shall cover at least the following products: meat meal, bone meal, meat-and-bone meal, hydrolysed proteins of Category 3 materials,processed manure, compost, biogas digestion residues, feather meal, glycerine and other products ofCategory 2 or 3 materials derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels, as well aspetfood, feed and dog chews that have been refused for commercial reasons or technical failures, andderived products from blood of animals, hides and skins, hoofs and horns, guano of bats and birds,wool and hair , feathers and downs, and pig bristles.
Where the assessment concludes that thosederived products no longer pose any signi ﬁcant risk to public or animal health, the Commission shall determine an end point in the manufacturing chain pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article without undue delay and in any case no later than six months after the assessment is ﬁnalised .’ Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 21lays down implementing measures: (a) for the public and animal health rules for animal by-products and derived products laid down in Regulation (EC) No1069/2009; (b) concerning certain samples and items exempt from veterinary checks at borderinspection posts as provided for in Article 16(1)(e) and (f) of Directive 97/78/EC. This EU regulationprovides requirements regarding the processing and transformation of ABP into different derivedmaterials.In relation to the declaration of end points, there are a number of derived products that have been declared end points in the manufacturing chain according to this regulation.

Description of the materials included in the mandate 3.2.1.Ash derived from incineration, co-incineration and combustion According to the ABP EU Regulations, incineration can be de ﬁned as the disposal of ABP or derived products as waste, in an incineration plant, as de ﬁned in point 4 of Article 3 of Directive 2000/76/EC22.Co-incineration means the recovery or disposal of ABP or derived products, if they are waste, in aco-incineration plant.Finally, combustion means a process involving the oxidation of fuel in order touse the energy value of the ABP or derived products, if they are not waste.According to Regulation (EC) 1069/2009, ABP , either categorised as Cat.1, Cat.2 or Cat.
3 material, can be disposed of as a waste by incineration or co-incineration directly without prior processing or following processing, by pressure sterilisation, if the competent authority requires so, and permanentmarking of the resulting material, or used as a fuel for combustion with or without prior processing. The process can take place in open-air, ﬁxed-facility or air-curtain systems.Open-air systems include the burning of carcasses or other ABP on combustible heaps known as pyres.Material requirements foropen-air burning include straw or hay, untreated timbers, kindling wood, coal and diesel fuel.Fixed-facility systems include (a) small on-farm incinerators, (b) small and large incineration facilities, (c)crematoria and (d) power plant incinerators.Fixed-facility systems are wholly contained and, usually, highly controlled.They are typically fuelled by diesel, natural gas or propane.
Newer designs of ﬁxed- facility systems are ﬁtted with afterburner chambers designed to completely burn hydrocarbon gases and particulate matter exiting from the main combustion chamber. In air-curtain systems, large-capacity fans,driven by diesel engines, deliver high-velocity air down into either a metal refractory box or burn pit(trench).Air-curtain systems vary in size according to the amount of material to be incinerated.Materialsneeded for air-curtain systems include wood (preferably pallets) and fuel (e.g., diesel fuel) for both theﬁre and the air-curtain fan.Unlike ﬁxed-facility systems, air-curtain systems are not wholly contained and are at the mercy of many variable factors (e.g.human operation, the weather, local community preferences, etc.) (National Agricultural Biosecurity Center, 2004).
According to Annex III, Chapter 1, Section 2 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011, incineration or co-incineration plants shall be designed, equipped, built and operated in such a waythat the gas resulting from the process is raised in a controlled and homogeneous fashion, even underthe most unfavourable conditions, to a temperature of 850 °C for at least 2 s or to a temperature of 1,100 °C for 0.2 s, as measured near the inner wall or at another representative point of the chamber where the incineration or the co-incineration is carried out, as authorised by the competent authority. 3.2.2.Glycerine derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels Biodiesel consists of mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids mostly produced from vegetable oils and animal fats.The total global production of biodiesel was approximately 35 –45 million tonnes in 2019 (Flach et al., online).
The European Union is the world ’s largest biodiesel producer and, in 2020, the European biodiesel industry produced in 2020 more than 15 million tonnes of biodiesel (75% of the total transport biofuels market on an energy basis).23 For biodiesel production, a fat fraction derived from ABP of all categories may be used. Such fats include extracted beef tallow, mutton tallow, pork lard and chicken fat (Sai Akhil and Alagumalai,2019).Other fats used are those resulting from meat and the meat processing industry and thosefrom recycling practices within the industrial cooking business.In 2019, 800,000 thousand tonnes(~6% of total feedstock) corresponded to animal fats, and such amount has remained fairly constant since 2014 (Ramos et al., 2019).The major steps in the production of biodiesel from animal fat waste are shown in Figure 1.A pretreatment (e.g.
heat drying, silica gel, treatment with calcium chloride or anhydrous sodium sulfate, neutralisation or separation) is needed because feedstocks usually contain a high proportion of freefatty acids (FFA) and water which reduce the yield of biodiesel and have to be removed (Gebremariam 22Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste OJ L 332, 28.12.2000, pp. 91 –111.23https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/european-union-biofuels-annual-0Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 17 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 and Marchetti, 2018; Felizardo et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2002).
Biodiesel is then produced through a transesteri ﬁcation reaction of a fat with a short-chain alcohol (usually methanol) in the presence of a catalyst (such as an alkali, acid or enzyme) (Ma and Hanna, 1999; Ramadhas et al., 2005).Transesteri ﬁcation consists of the conversion of triacylglycerols to diacylglycerols, releasing one fatty acid. Diacylglycerols are then converted to monoacylglycerols, releasing a second fatty acid and, ﬁnally, monoacylglycerols are converted to glycerol, releasing a third fatty acid (Toldr /C19a-Reig et al., 2020).In industrial processing plants, ~100 kg of fat react with 10 kg of methanol in the presence of an alkaline catalyst (i.e.sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide), to produce 100 kg of biodiesel and 10 kg of glycerine (US Department of Energy, 2020; Toldr /C19a-Reig et al., 2020).
An alternative process would be a two-step transesteri ﬁcation, with the ﬁrst step being an acid- catalysed pretreatment to esterify the FFA and thus reduce their content, and the second step being the transesteri ﬁcation (Ramadhas et al., 2005). Large amounts of glycerine (containing at least 95% glycerol) are generated during transesteri ﬁcation.Glycerine is puri ﬁed, along with the removal of other impurities such as residual catalyst, unconverted fats and soap, through wet washing, based on water, dry washing, based onadsorption and ion exchange, or novel methods based on liquid –liquid extraction, deep eutectic solvents or membranes (Sander et al., 2018).Glycerine is a versatile and valuable chemical substance with manyapplications.In the conventional glycerine re ﬁning processes, the crude glycerine solution is initially treated with additional chemicals to remove any dissolved fatty acids or soaps, followed by processing in a higher temperature, high vacuum distillation unit.
The condensed glycerine solution is further treatedto remove traces of residual fatty acids, esters or other organic compounds (FAO, 2012).
According to Annex IV, Chapter IV, Section 2 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 42/2011, biodiesel production shall be carried out according to the following processing standards: a) Unless ﬁsh oil or rendered fat are used which have been produced in accordance with Sections VIII or XII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, respectively, the fat fractionderived from animal by-products must be ﬁrst processed using: i) in the case of Category 1 or 2 materials, processing method 1 (pressure sterilisation) as set out in Chapter III; and ii) in the case of Category 3 materials, any of the processing methods 1 –5 or processing method 7 or , in the case of material derived from ﬁsh, processing methods 1 –7 as set out in Chapter III; b) The processed fat must then be processed further using one of the following methods: i) a process whereby the processed fat must be separated from the protein and in the case of fat from ruminant origin, insoluble impurities in excess of 0.15% by weight must beremoved, and the processed fat must be subsequently submitted to esteri ﬁcation and transesteri ﬁcation.
Figure 1: Major steps in the production of biodiesel from animal fat waste (Toldr /C19a-Reig et al., 2020)Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 18 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 However, ester ﬁcation is not required for processed fat derived from Category 3 material. For ester ﬁcation the pH must be reduced to less than 1 by adding sulphuric acid (H 2SO4) or an equivalent acid and the mixture must be heated to 72 °C for at least two hours during which it must be intensely mixed.Transester ﬁcation must be carried out by increasing the pH to about 14 with potassium hydroxide or with an equivalent base at 35 °Ct o5 0 °C for at least 15 min.Transester ﬁcation shall be carried out twice under the conditions described in this point using a new base solution.
This process must be followed by re ﬁnement of the products including vacuum distillation at 150 °C, leading to biodiesel; ii) a process using equivalent process parameters authorised by the competent authority. 3.2.3.Other materials derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels Other renewable fuels (jet fuel, propane, gasoline) can also be obtained from the same sort of feedstocks (i.e.rendered fats) used to produce biodiesel through a multistep process involving apretreatment which consists of bleaching and removal of remaining insoluble impurities by ﬁltration, followed by a catalytic conversion step at high temperatures (250 –265°C) and high pressures (20 –30 bar).The main by-products generated in the pretreatment process are clay from bleaching and sludgefrom ﬁltration.
Annex IV, Chapter IV, Section 2 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 highlights that some renewable fuels can be produced through alternative methods: Point 2.J: multistep catalytic process a) The starting materials for this process can be: i) rendered fats derived from Category 2 material, which have been processed using processing method 1 (pressure sterilisation); ii) Fish oil or rendered fats derived from Category 3 material, which have been processed using:any of the processing methods 1 –5 or processing method 7; or in the case of material derived from ﬁsh oil, any of the processing methods 1 –7; iii) Fish oil or rendered fat which have been produced in accordance with Sections VIII or XII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, respectively. b) The use of rendered fats derived from Category 1 material for this process shall be prohibited.
According to point 2.J.2, the process consists of: a) A pre-treatment which consists of: i) the bleaching of the centrifuged materials by passing them through a clay ﬁlter; ii) the removal of remaining insoluble impurities by ﬁltration. b) The pre-treated materials must be then submitted to a multi-step catalytic process which consists of a hydro-deoxygenisation step, followed by an isomerisation step.The materials must be submitted to a pressure of at least 20 bars at a temperature of at least 250 °C for at least 20 min.Point 2.L: multistep catalytic hydro-treatment process: Point 2.L.1 describes the pretreatment.For this process, the following materials may be used: a) rendered fats derived from Category 1 material, which have been processed using processing method 1 (pressure sterilisation); b) rendered fats and ﬁsh oil complying with point J(1)(a) of this Section.
According to point 2.J.2: a) The rendered fat must be submitted to a pre-treatment which consists at least of bleaching of the starting material, including rendered fats, with acid in the presence of bleaching clay andsubsequent removal of the used bleaching clay and insoluble impurities by ﬁltration.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 19 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Prior to this treatment rendered fat may be degummed with acid and/or caustic solution in order to remove impurities from the rendered fat by forming gums and subsequentlyseparating those gums by centrifugation. b) The pre-treated materials must be then submitted to a hydro-treatment process which consists of a catalytic hydro-treatment step, a stripping step followed by an isomerisation step.The materials must be submitted to a pressure of at least 30 bars at a temperature of at least265 °C for at least 20 min .
The raw materials for both methods are rendered fats processed by the different methods of ABP processing according to Commission Regulation (EU) 142/2011 (Appendix B) before they are subject to the pretreatments, resulting in the production of derived products. Thus, the subsequent hydrolyticprocesses to produce renewable fuels do not affect the derived products like bleaching clay.3.2.4.
Hides and skins As already mentioned in Section 3.1, point 3 Article 10 of Regulation (EC) 1069/2009 de ﬁnes as Category 3 ABP: ‘hides and skins, including trimmings and splitting thereof ,[...]of: animals, other than ruminants requiring TSE testing, and ruminants which have been tested with a negative result inaccordance with Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 , as well as hides and skins ,[...] originating from dead animals that did not show any signs of disease communicable through that product to humans or animals, other than those referred to in (b) of this Article .’ Hides and skins are one of the most valuable ABP of the meat industry. Most of the raw material is converted into leather and processed products such as collagen, gelatine, protein hydrolysates, petchews or glue.
The skin is composed of three major layers: the surface pigmented epidermis including the top layer of the hide (grain), the underlying connective tissue between the grain and the corium and thedeep subcutis (corium) (Figure 2). The main component (over 53%) of hides is protein (Bwirhonde et al., 2018), represented by multiple components such as albumin, elastin, collagen and keratin.Hides and/or skins can be obtained from all species of farmed animals including bovines, small ruminants, swine, equines, poultry, cervids and ﬁsh, for multiple purposes.They can either be obtained from slaughterhouses directly or their subproducts from tanneries or leather producing facilities.Theskins of heads and legs are not removed from the bones and are usually disposed of and renderedtogether, not being harvested and used as stand-alone by-products.
The processing of hides and skins generates by-products such as hide offcuts and shavings, or soft material from ﬂeshing, which ﬁnd applications in several industry sectors such as pet and animal food production, ﬁne chemicals including photography and cosmetics, and fertilisers (European Commisssion, online; JRC, 2013). For use as organic fertilisers, different end products can be obtained, depending onthe transformation process: enzymatic hydrolysis (liquid fertiliser) and thermal hydrolysis (solid fertiliser)(Ciavatta et al., 2012).In the leather industry, approximately 70% of the weight of fresh raw materials is solid waste, most of it produced during the pre-tanning or beam house process (80%).
Solid waste generated by the (a): Source: https://illiciumlondon.co.uk/what-is-the-best-quality-of-leather-the-ultimate-leather-buying-guide/ Figure 2: Layers of the skin for the production of leather(a)Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 20 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 leather industry during tannery and post-tannery can be classi ﬁed as follows (Ozgunay et al., 2007): (i) wastes from untanned hides/skins (trimmings, ﬂeshing wastes); (ii) wastes from tanned leather (shaving wastes, buf ﬁng dust); and (iii) wastes from dyed and ﬁnished leather (trimmings from leather). Fresh hides and skins need to be preserved for collection, transport and further processing.The main goal is to remove the moisture (either by air or with salt) to protect the hides and skins fromputrefaction.This process is called curing and leads to a more stable material (FAO, 1996).
According to the de ﬁnitions of Annex I of Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011: ‘treated hides and skins means derived products from untreated hides and skins, other than dog-chews, that have been: (a) dried; (b) dry-salted or wet-salted for a period of at least 14 days prior to dispatch; (c)salted for a period of at least seven days in sea salt with the addition of 2% of sodium carbonate; (d)dried for a period of at least 42 days at a temperature of at least 20 °C; or (e) subject to a preservation process other than tanning. ’ As the hides and skins that may be placed on the market without restrictions refer to those for purposes other than human consumption and to those treated and destined for the leather industry,details of the processing of hides and skins for the production of leather are described below.Manufacturing of leather is a multistep process (Figure 3), extensively described in technical and scienti ﬁc literature.
The main processing steps are beamhouse operations, tanning, post-tanning and ﬁnishing. Solid waste is generated mostly pre-tanning at the beamhouse.Beamhouse The beamhouse stage includes all the operations to prepare the raw material for tanning.As described by Ozgunay et al.(2007), Chattopadhyay et al.(2011), Valeika et al.(2012), FAO (1996),Biosecurity New Zealand (2007) and ENEA (2020), it commonly includes: Trimming: mechanical removal of unwanted parts.Soaking: re-hydration and washing to remove substances like dirt, blood and salt (a bactericide can be added).Fleshing: mechanical removal of excess ﬂesh and fat (hypodermis) adhered to the hide.
The material obtained by removing meat residues and connective subcutaneous tissues from the ﬂesh side of the skin before further processing is considered one of the most important by- products from the leather industry and accounts for about 10 –15% of the animal skin (Corte et al., 2014) and up to 30% of the solid waste (Chattopadhyay et al., 2011). To ensure eventhickness, excess material from the ﬂesh side of the hide is removed (shaving).Dehairing: immersion in an alkaline solution [lime (Ca(OH) 2) in combination with sul ﬁdes such as sodium sul ﬁde (Na 2S) (pH > 12)] to remove the epidermis and the hair and wool and to loosen the ﬁbrous structure of the hide.This process can be of different durations based on the combination of chemicals used in the process; from minutes to hours (Valeika et al., 2012).The hair can be used further for fertiliser production.Liming: immersion in a strong alkaline bath that opens the collagen structure.
At this point, there could be a second ﬂeshing step after liming to clean residual ﬂesh (Ozgunay et al., 2007). According to the legislation, limed hides must be treated with lime and in brine at a pHof 12 –13 for at least 8 h.Splitting: the hides are split mechanically into two or three layers.Deliming/Bating (drenching ): These are enzymatic and chemical treatments aimed at opening structures, to remove unwanted proteins and excess of natural fat from the hide and to provide a homogenous structure.In order to remove the lime, hides are subject toneutralisation (i.e.with ammonium or organic salts, enzymes or carbon dioxide) anddegreasing (using surfactants or solvents).The hides are bated, i.e.bathing at 38 –40°C and a pH of 8.5 for proteolytic enzymes to optimally break down collagen, elastin and reticulin inorder to achieve desired consistency.
Pickling: treatment with an acidic solution (pH < 3, sulfuric acid, formic acid or acetic acid) for around 16 h to fully neutralise the alkali. Salt is added to prevent the hide from swelling.Bactericides or fungicides [e.g.0.05% 2-(thiocyanomethylthio) benzothiazole;Biosecurity New Zealand, 2007] can also be added.At the end of all these steps, the obtained product is the pickled pelt that is ready for tanning.The pickling process allows the storage and transport of the pelts for up to 12 months.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 21 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Tanning Tanning is either done with chromium salts, vegetable tannins or organic compounds which cross- link the ﬁbres stabilising the hide and producing the ‘resistant leather ’as it is known.Tanning is usually done after the hide has been degreased with solvents and surfactants.The ﬁnal product is dried and dyed (CPRAC, online).
After pickling, chrome tanning consists of the addition of chromium salts (Cr3+) to a pickled pelt that has a very low pH. In order to increase it, an alkaline buffer is added and the chromium ionscross-link with free carboxyl groups of the collagen making the hide resistant to bacteria and hightemperature.The product resulting from this treatment is called ‘wet blue ’and contains 40% of dry matter and 2 –3% of dry weight of Cr 3+.Post-tanning The next steps of the processing include re-tanning using one or more combined tanning agents and dying with the desired colour and treatment with fat to increase the smoothness of the ﬁnal product.Then, excess water and fat are removed and the ﬁnal product dried (sammying), usually with vacuum drying.Further trimming of unwanted parts can be carried out at this stage.Finishing The ﬁnal step of the full process is the application of multiple coats on the surface of the leather to improve resistance and aspect.
Further trimming of unwanted parts can also be carried out at this stage.

Its use in recentdecades has been affected by issues such as political changes (e.g. the democratisation of easternEurope) and the economic integration of the European community, poor economic returns and bycompetition from petrol-carbon or oil-based arti ﬁcialﬁbres.Ecologically sensitive methods for wool production and processing and its inherent degradability have recognised importance.Primary hairfollicles typically, although with some exceptions, produce outer ﬁbres of greater diameter, than the underlying and more valuable ﬁnerﬁbres from secondary follicles.The ﬁbres from different animal species have various properties, such as colour, medullation, tensile strength, diameter ( ﬁneness) and staple length.These properties determine the end use, from small diameter super ﬁne garments to the coarser ﬁbres utilised in carpets and furniture upholstery (Galbraith, 2019).
‘Hair ’ﬁbre is produced by the division of keratinocyte (epidermal) cells which line the base of the follicle in contact with underlying dermal tissue (Galbraith, 2010a,b). These cells divide and migratetowards, and beyond, the skin surface.The rate of proliferation of these cells also determines the rateof growth of ﬁbre (cortex and cuticle), and ﬂeece, and determines staple length.As the cells migrate, they deposit a range of proteins in the internal skeleton and other proteins and lipids which are important in adhesion between cells and which contribute to the properties of softness, ﬂexibility, moisture absorption and tensile strength (Lyons, 2009).In addition, consistency of husbandry andnutrition of animals have implications for uniformity of chemical and physical composition along thelength of ﬁbres (Galbraith, 2000).The end use of wool and hair is determined by their physical properties and the preferences of consumers.
They can be used in clothing (typically smallest diameters and highest monetary value forknitwear and suiting), in domestic ‘home ’environment (typically coarser and hard wearing for upholstery, carpets, insulation) and external environment [materials in transport vehicles (carpets, upholstery)], horticulture (plant beddings, fertilisers) or, if of inadequate quality, unused and deposited in land ﬁll or incinerated (Galbraith, 2019). Different methods to treat wool and hair as raw materials are reported in the literature.The ﬁrst step is represented by degreasing using different solutions such as ammonia, anhydrous sodiumcarbonate and ethoxylated alkyl non-ionic detergent (Berechet et al., 2018).The washing/degreasingstep consists of the immersion of the wool and hair in baths of water, soap and different solutions.Littledata are reported in the literature on the washing step procedures currently applied.
Berechet et al.(2018) described ammonia solution 25% p.a., anhydrous sodium carbonate p.a. and ethoxylated alkyl non-ionic detergent as possible solutions for wool degreasing.The second step is enzymatic hydrolysis or hydrolysis by acids (HCl, HCOOH, H 2SO4) or bases (NaOH, KOH and CaO).The process is performed at high temperature injecting heated or superheated water (120 °for 20 min or 150 –170°C for 1 h) into the hydrolysis reactor to reach the desired physical conditions (Onifade et al., 1998; Sargison, 2009;Bhavsar et al., 2017).The alkaline or acid hydrolysis leads to the degradation of proteins to obtainoligopeptides and amino acids.These treatments also break disul ﬁde bonds characteristic of wool which confers speci ﬁc mechanical properties to this ﬁbre (Gupta and Ramnani, 2006).
The application of acid and alkaline hydrolysis at a commercial scale has its limitations, such as the cost of the chemicals and puri ﬁcation of the ﬁnal product, etc., while enzymatic hydrolysis requires a high capital investment and is a time-consuming process. Hydrolysis with superheated water is aprocess in which the extraction of proteins from the wool matrix is carried out under controlledconditions.The high temperature of the hydrolysis treatment sterilises the ﬁnal product, which indirectly avoids potential health-related problems ahead of the ﬁnal application of the product obtained (Liu et al., 2014).Nustorova et al.(2006) described the preparation of wool hydrolysate using a thermo-chemical method previously described by Gousterova et al.(2003), experimentally represented by alkaline hydrolysis in an autoclave.A de ﬁned quantity of wool waste (10 g) was mixed with 100 mL of 0.15 mol/L KOH –0.05 mol/L NaOH and heated at 120 °C for 20 min.
The supernatant ﬂuid (after centrifugation at 4,000g for 20 min) was concentrated on a rotary vacuum evaporator and dried at 70 °C, ground to powder and stored in a tightly stoppered ﬂask.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 23 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Bhavsar et al. (2017) tested superheated water hydrolysis of waste wool.In the process, waste wool was treated with saturated steam at a temperature of 170 °C and pressure of 7.0 bar for 60 min.Composting of wool scouring sludge was tested in the United Kingdom (Pearson et al., 2003).Due to the high moisture content and small particles in the scouring sludge, mixing with green waste, asadditional compostable material, was necessary.In particular, 4.5 tonnes of wool scouring sludge werethoroughly mixed with 3.4 tonnes of green waste.The composting pile was aerated through a pre-installed air distributor.
After 110 days, all the parameters showed that composting was an appropriateand useful process for wool scouring sludge waste decomposition to avoid pollution. Composted waste wool or hydrolysates prepared with microbial or enzymatic pretreatments show promising results in ﬁeld experiments as fertilisers, and also as substrates for biogas production.There are already some innovative ideas described for waste wool applications (production of wool peptone,amino acids, keratinolytic enzymes), but further research may reveal even more possibilities for highvalue-added product development from waste wool.3.2.6.
Feathers and down Article 10 of Regulation (EC) 1069/2009, point 3, de ﬁnes ‘feather ’as Category 3 ABP originating from: ‘(b) animals that have been slaughtered in a slaughterhouse and considered ﬁt for human consumption following the ante-mortem inspection or game killed for human consumption inaccordance with Community legislation; (h) live animals that did not show any signs of diseasescommunicable through that product to human or animals; (n) dead animals that did not show any signof disease communicable to humans or animals .’ The poultry industry has become one of the largest food industries in the world, producing large quantities of feather waste. Between 5% and 10% of the total weight of a chicken is made of feathers(Callegaro et al., 2019).More than 1 million metric tonnes of feathers are produced annually as a by-product at European poultry slaughterhouses (Goerner-Hu et al., 2020).
Due to a large variety ofchemical hazards and microbiota present on the feathers, including pathogens, they must be treatedquickly. Poultry feathers are rich in keratin protein, which makes them a good source of nitrogenfertiliser (Joardar and Rahman, 2018).Chicken feather waste can be: 1) Incinerated.This process is effective at inactivating biological hazards but requires a high energy consumption (Saidan et al., 2017) and produces large amounts of carbon dioxide.2) Composted with manure.The composting process is slow and subject to the special requirements of veterinary inspection and requires a closed composting area with a sewagecarry system, and periodic microbiological tests according to Commission Regulation (EU)No 142/2011.A problem for composting is odorous emission of hydrogen sul ﬁde that persists in the air for a long period.Moreover, according to Tronina and Bubel (2008), composting may not fully inactivate pathogenic microorganisms.
3) Hydrolysed (Tesfaye et al., 2017a,b). Feather hydrolysis provides valuable amino acids, proteins and peptides in the mixture with acylglycerols and higher fatty acids.Chemicalhydrolysis leads to destruction of the native structure of keratin and the feather wastebecomes more water soluble.Acidic hydrolysis is highly ef ﬁcient but causes loss of some amino acids.Alkaline hydrolysis is slower and can be incomplete, but the loss of amino acidsis lower.The yield of the hydrolytic processes depends on pH, temperature and reactiontime, and also on the type and concentration of acid or base used.As a drawback, commonly applied hydrolysis leads to the requirement for subsequent recycling of the process solutions, including neutralisation and elimination of undesirable salts (Solcovaet al., 2021).4) Treated in dimethyl sulfoxide or other solvents to get value added products from feather keratin, generated in excess from various livestock industries (Azmi et al., 2018).3.2.7.
Pig bristles Article 10 of Regulation (EC) 1069/2009, point 3 (b), de ﬁnes ‘pig bristles ’as Category 3 ABP originating either from animals that: ‘have been slaughtered in a slaughterhouse and considered ﬁt for human consumption following the ante-mortem inspection [...]or game killed for human consumption in accordance with Community legislation .’Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 24 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Pig bristles consist primarily of keratin (90% or more), an insoluble protein packed with ﬁbres cross-linked by disul ﬁde bonds. The slaughterhouses collect both bristles and hooves during or shortly after the dehairing process.The weight of the pig bristles harvested from a single pig could reach0.9 kg (Gonzalo et al., 2016).
Considering that approximately 245 million pigs were slaughtered in theEU in 2019, 24the total throughput of this by-product would be 220,000 tonnes of pig bristles annually. Preparation of the pig bristles for further treatment is based on soaking in warm water and soap for 60 min before rinsing and drying at 60 °C overnight (Gonzalo et al., 2016).The traditional technology for degradation of raw pig bristles is based on long-term heating, alkaline hydrolysis or the hydrolysation with high pressure and heat (6 bar, 150 °C for at least 20 min) (Gonzalo et al., 2016; Falco et al., 2019; Espersen et al., 2020).Other treatments were described in individual studies, e.g.thermo-chemical treatment (121 °C, 20 min, 1 g bristle per 100 cm 3sodium sul ﬁte solution) ( Łaba et al., 2016), or washing and degreasing with a methanol-chloroform solution (Laba and Rodziewicz,2014), among others.
The main purpose of these treatments is the extraction of pure keratin and itssubsequent conversion into smaller protein molecules of higher nutritional or industrial value throughenzymatic, chemical or microbial based techniques. 3.2.8.Horns, horn products, hooves and hoof products Point 3 Article 10 of Regulation (EC) 1069/2009 de ﬁnes as Category 3 material ABP horns, and hoof cuts originating from: ‘(b) horns of animals, other than ruminants requiring TSE testing, and ruminants which have been tested with a negative result in accordance with Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No999/2001; (h) live animals that did not show any signs of disease communicable through that product to humans or animals; (n) hooves and horns originating from dead animals that did not show any signs of disease communicable through that product to humans or animals, other than those referredto in point (b) of this Article .’ Horns and hooves are by-products in slaughterhouses and meat plants.
Horns vary in size, shape, colour and curvature according to the breed, age, sex, etc. The term horn in everyday language iscommonly applied to both the horn pith, the inner part, and the horn itself, and these are used fordifferent purposes.The horn pith is also called horn core and is similar to bone, although it containsmore ossein.As a result, it is a valuable raw material for gelatine production.Alternatively, it may be used for the production of bone meal.Horns and hooves are keratin-rich ( a-keratin) materials consisting of tightly packed protein chains in a-helices stabilised by high degrees of disul ﬁde and hydrogen bond cross-linking, as well as hydrophobic interactions, which render them insoluble andresistant to biodegradation.This is a major obstacle in native keratin processing.Animal remains richina-keratin are in nature relatively quickly biodegraded by keratinolytic microorganisms (Korni łłowicz- Kowalska and Bohacz, 2011).
They can be co-digested together with swine manure or slaughterhousesludge in an anaerobic digester at 25 °C, without physico-chemical or enzymatic treatment, to generate methane (Xia et al., 2015). The resulting nutrient-rich digestate may be used in agriculture (Salminen and Rintala, 2002).Hooves can also be treated using urea (to break non-covalent bonds), sodium dodecyl sulfate (for disruption of strong intermolecular interactions) and mercaptoethanol (to cleavethe disul ﬁde bonds in keratin), at 60 °C, to get keratin in aqueous solution ﬁrst and a lyophilised form afterwards (Shen et al., 2020).Hoof and horn meals contain from 16% to 17% nitrogen and are speci ﬁcally used as manure in tea and coffee plantations.The horns and hooves are treated separately.After the animal is slaughtered, the horns are cut off with a saw or a cleaver or shears at their base.The horn pith can be removed by steaming for a few moments or by immersing the horn in hot water at 65.6 °C (150 °F).
After this, a blow from a hammer will separate the pith from the horn. The hooves are soaked in water until they become spongy and can be freed from the bones, after which they are dried at the sun (Omole and Ogbiye, 2013) or, according to producers ’sites, at 140 °C.The horn and hooves of cattle are steamed under pressure, digested, crushed and disintegrated forpreparation of hoof and horn meal by 8 hours rendering and ﬁne milling.The hoof and horn meal may be mixed with bone meal and used as fertiliser because of the high nitrogen content.24https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/ ﬁles/food-farming- ﬁsheries/farming/documents/pig-slaughterings-eu_en.pdfInactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 25 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 3.3.

40.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 35 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 3.4. Indicator microorganisms The behaviour of microorganisms (bacterial, fungi and viruses) throughout processing or transformation methods can be dif ﬁcult (maybe even impossible) to elucidate for every single individual organism that may represent a hazard, in part due to their irregular distribution and usually low occurrence and concentration in raw materials that preclude a robust quanti ﬁcation of inactivation levels.In such instances, indicator microorganisms have been used.For inactivation or heat treatmentprocesses, indicator microorganisms typically represent the most resilient or resistant organisms withinspeci ﬁc categories.
The effect of processing or transformation methodologies can therefore be assessed, as if these resilient indicator microorganisms are inactivated, then less resilient biologicalhazards can also be assumed to be inactivated. Thus, indicator microorganisms are typically chosen torepresent proxies for less resilient/stable organisms.A list of common indicator microorganisms isgiven in Table 2.Data on inactivation of indicator microorganisms on industrial-scale systems are generally recommended to determine the inactivation ef ﬁciency of a process.Ideally, the performance and validity of an indicator should be established for each selected inactivation process and matrix ofconcern.However, some indicator organisms are widely recognised as valuable for such processvalidation tests.
In the particular case of the indicator organisms mentioned in the requirements foralternative transformation parameters for biogas and composting plants in terms of the validation ofthe intended process, referred to in point 1 of Section 2 of Chapter III of Annex V CommissionRegulation (EU) No 142/2011, these are Enterococcus faecalis ,Salmonella Senftenberg (775W, H 2S negative), parvovirus and eggs of Ascaris sp. 3.4.1.Enterococcus faecalis E.faecalis is a member of the genus Enterococcus and is a Gram-positive non-spore-forming bacterium.It is described as an opportunistic pathogen which particularly affects immunocompromisedpopulations.E.faecalis is found in the gut of healthy humans but only reported in some warm-blooded animals, including dogs, and chickens (Pourcher et al., 1991; Wheeler et al., 2002).E.faecalis is identi ﬁed as a heat-resistant organism, resulting in its successful application in process validation (Watcharasukarn et al., 2009).Indeed, E.
faecalis often serves also as an indicator microorganism to characterise the performance of hygienisation processes (Sahlstr €om, 2003). Another enterococcus, E.faecium, is also widely evaluated as an indicator organism for validating bacterial inactivation in different kinds of thermal processes (Kopit et al., 2014; Ceylan and Bautista, 2015).However, it isE.faecalis the indicator organism which is mentioned in point 1 of Section 2 of Chapter III of Annex V of Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011.Both E.faecalis and E.faecium serve as indicator microorganisms for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative non-spore-forming bacteria, given the higher thermal tolerance that Gram-positive cocci generally show as compared with that of other non-spore-forming bacterial species.3.4.2.Salmonella Senftenberg Salmonellae are Gram-negative non-spore-forming motile rod bacteria.
They are widespread in nature and found in food, soil, water, manure (Win ﬁeld and Groisman, 2003) and biological waste streams (Burtscher and Wuertz, 2003). The main reservoir of non-typhoidal Salmonella are theTable 2: Indicator microorganisms frequently used as proxies for less stable organisms Name Indicator for Escherichia coli Gram /C0ve, non-spore-forming coliform bacteria Salmonella Senftenberg Gram /C0ve, non-spore-forming bacteria Enterococcus faecalis Gram +ve, non-spore-forming bacteria Clostridium spp.Gram +ve, spore-forming bacteria Mycobacterium spp.Acid-fast, thermoresistant bacteria Bovine parvovirus Viruses Calicivirus Viruses Ascaris sp.Parasites Cryptosporidium parvum ParasitesInactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 36 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 animals, but they are well adapted to their surroundings and cycle between environmental matrices and living hosts.
Certain serovars or strains of Salmonella enterica are noted for their high resistance to thermal treatments, relative to other Salmonella spp. or Gram-negative bacteria, the most prominent being Salmonella Senftenberg, particularly the strain 775W (Ng et al., 1969).In different model systems, this strain has shown D-values (times needed to reduce the bacterial population at agiven temperature by 1 log 10unit) around 10-fold to 20-fold higher than those of other serovars, such asSalmonella Typhimurium or Salmonella Enteritidis (Doyle and Mazzotta, 2000).Salmonella Senftenberg is not a major food-borne pathogen, and it is often used as an indicator organism to validate thermal treatments (Ng et al., 1969).The implication is that if a particular thermal process achieves a suf ﬁcient level of reduction for S.Senftenberg 775W, it will also be effective against all salmonellae and other Gram-negative non-spore-forming bacteria (Doyle and Mazzotta, 2000).3.4.3.
Parvovirus Parvovirus is a relatively common thermoresistant virus found in livestock (Lund et al., 1996) and humans (Qiu et al., 2017). Animal parvoviruses have been reported to be the most heat-resistantviruses (Sauerbrei and Wutzler, 2009), and are therefore frequently used as indicators to validate thevirucidal ef ﬁcacy of thermal processes.In a systematic review conducted by Nims and Plavsic (2013a) comparing different viral families for their susceptibility to heat inactivation, it was demonstrated that,among the four families included in the ELS for inactivation data, Parvoviridae is by far the most heat- resistant viral family followed by Caliciviridae and Picornaviridae .Likewise, Knight et al.(2013) reviewed available data and mechanisms regarding the thermal inactivation of a number of important pathogenic animal viruses (e.g.
African swine fever virus, classical swine fever virus, infectious bursal disease virus, Rift Valley fever virus, avian in ﬂuenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, Foot and mouth disease virus, swine vesicular disease virus, Bluetongue virus) in comparison with relevant indicatorviruses and concluded that non-enveloped small DNA viruses, such as parvovirus, were amongst themost heat-resistant viruses reported. Among parvoviruses, Porcine parvovirus and Bovine parvovirus have been suggested as good indicator viruses because of their relatively high thermal resistance, because they appear commonly inlivestock (Srivastava and Lund, 1980) and because in vitro culture systems are available to test their viability.Given their persistence at high temperatures, they are regularly used as indicator viruses for thermal treatments validation.
In addition, due to their relatively small size (20 –24 nm diameter), screening or ﬁltration systems that remove parvoviruses would typically be expected to remove other larger viruses, and hence, they are also used as indicators to evaluate processes for the production ofbiological materials from cell cultures in the pharma and biotechnology industries (Stuckey et al.,2014). Bovine parvovirus strain Haden has been speci ﬁcally recommended for use in the evaluation of thermo-chemical and thermal disinfection procedures to assess their virucidal effectiveness (Br €auniger et al., 1994, 2000).3.4.4.Ascaris spp.Ascaris spp.are parasites and members of the geohelminths, which can colonise the intestinal tract of animals and humans.The eggs are highly resistant to adverse environmental conditions, includingdesiccation and chemical treatment (including acids) (Pecson and Nelson, 2005).
The eggs of Ascaris suum , a close relative of the very similar human-infecting species Ascaris lumbricoides , have been used as an indicator for helminths when examining the effects of various waste treatment processes(USEPA, 1999), such as aerobic (Kato et al., 2003) and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (Aitken et al.,2005), ammonia treatment of wastewater (Ghiglietti et al., 1997) or composting of sewage sludge(Paluszak et al., 2003). Ascaris suum is a parasitic helminth of pigs, which occasionally infects cattle and on rare occasions humans, and is considered one of the most resilient helminths (USEPA, 1999).Ascaris eggs are also one of the most heat-resistant parasitic ova and hence are well suited as an indicator of parasite survival in general (Sahlstr €om et al., 2008).3.5.
Viral hazard identi ﬁcation in Groups 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 (AQ3) In order to identify the viral hazards to address in the Category 2 and 3 materials and derived products of the mandate, there was a need to differentiate between intrinsic risk (i.e. risk fromhazards isolated in the matrix) and potential contamination risk (i.e.faecal contamination, unhygienichandling and storage) in the selected matrices.Intrinsic viral hazards are most likely to be prevalent inInactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 37 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 the raw materials and hence of greatest concern given the potential for widespread occurrence in the raw tissues.Contamination events may be sporadic, involve a wide range of viral hazards or be case-speci ﬁc, making the inclusion of a particular contamination risk in this assessment very challenging.
If a contamination event is identi ﬁed as likely to occur it should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Thus, for the scope of this mandate, only viral hazards that are present in the unprocessed matrices asintrinsic viral hazards were considered.Groups 1, 2 and 3 (ash derived from incineration, co-incineration and combustion; glycerine; other products of materials derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels) are derived products.Although they can be obtained using a wide range of raw materials for their production, no intrinsic viral hazards in the ﬁnal products were identi ﬁed during the screening process.For these reasons, they were eliminated from the hazard identi ﬁcation assessment and the focus was on Groups 4–8.Results of the ELS and screening for the viral hazards are given in Tables 3and 4.
The greatest number of hits was found for group 5 (wool and hair) and group 4 (hides and skin), re ﬂecting the presence of intrinsic viral hazards in these matrices, while no intrinsic hazards were identi ﬁed in group 7 (pig bristles). The occurrence of the family Poxviridae is also re ﬂected in Tables 3and 4with the greatest number of hits (predominantly in hides and skin and wool and hair).While many families are speci ﬁc to a matrix, the family Flaviviridae was found to occur in three of the matrices (hides and skin; wool and hair; feathers and down).Table 3: Results of the ELS and screening for the viral hazards Group Group description Number of hits(a)Y(b)DN 4 Hides and skins 495 84 (35) 14 (1) 397 5 Wool and hair 728 105 (6) 41 (3) 582 6 Feathers and down 624 35 (9) 33 (0) 556 7 Pig bristles 38 3 (1) 3 (0) 32 8 Horns, horn products, hooves and hoof products97 5 (1) 10 (0) 82 (a): See Table A.2in Annex Afor the search string that produced the number of hits.

For this reason, it was decided to further focusonly on identi ﬁed viral hazards belonging to this group. The following non-enveloped viruses were identi ﬁed as relevant hazards in the different raw materials: Group 4 (Hides and Skins): Papillomaviridae (Bovine papillomavirus, Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus), Reoviridae (Bluetongue virus), Picornaviridae (Foot and mouth disease virus, Swine vesicular disease virus).Group 5 (Wool and hair): Picornaviridae (Foot and mouth disease virus), Parvoviridae (Ungulate tetraparvovirus).Group 6 (Feathers and down): Anelloviridae (Chicken anaemia virus, formerly classi ﬁed as Circoviridae ),Circoviridae (Duck circovirus).Group 7 (Pig bristles): none.Group 8 (Horns, horn products, hooves and hoof products): Picornaviridae (Senecavirus A).
The main characteristics of the six families of viruses identi ﬁed in the hazard identi ﬁcation are: a) Papillomaviridae Papillomaviruses are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that can infect mucosal and/orcutaneous epithelia and are largely species speci ﬁc. Bovine papillomaviruses belong to the Papillomaviridae family, which consists of a large number of small DNA oncogenic viruses infecting the epithelium and mucosa of many animals as well as humans causing benign hyperproliferative lesions or cancers (Bocaneti et al., 2016).The rabbit (Shope) papillomavirus, also called cottontailrabbit papillomavirus, is an oncogenic DNA virus of the Papillomaviridae family that is transmitted by biting arthropods (especially continental rabbit ticks, reduviid bugs and mosquitoes) (Hess andTater, 2012).b) Picornaviridae Swine vesicular disease (SVD) is a highly contagious viral disease in pigs.
SVD virus (SVDV) iscurrently classi ﬁed as a porcine variant of human coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5) (Van Rogenmortel et al., 2000) and a member of the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae . Natural infections caused by SVDV have only been reported in pigs.SVDV is spread primarily by contact with infectedswine or their excretions, or by feeding pigs with unheated meat products contaminated with SVDV.The virus is very stable in the environment (Lin and Kitching, 2000).SVDV causes a vesicular disease in pigs clinically indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease (genus Aphthovirus ) and indistinguishable from vesicular disease caused in pigs by Seneca Valley virus (genusSenecavirus ).25 Senecavirus A is the only member of the genus Senecavirus within the family Picornaviridae27.
Clinical SVA infection in pigs presents similar characteristics to other vesicular diseases, but clinicalsigns and lesions are relatively mild, albeit indistinguishable from other vesicular diseases.Cutaneous lesions are found more frequently on the lips, snout and tongue, and on the feet, affecting the coronary band, interdigital area, dewclaws and hoof pads (Segal /C19es et al., 2016). Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) belongs to the genus Aphthovirus within the family Picornaviridae .It causes foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) that is an acute and highly contagious disease, responsible for fever, lameness and vesicular lesions on the feet, tongue and teats.FMDVconsists of a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA genome of approximately 8,500 bases surrounded byfour structural proteins to form an icosahedral capsid (Grubman and Baxt, 2004).FMDV hasmultiple serotypes and broad host range and is thought to spread mainly from animal to animal byaerosol droplets between animals in close contact.
FMD seriously affects the livestock industry and threatens the international trade in animals and animal products (Jamal and Belsham, 2013; Li et al., 2021). c) Parvoviridae Ungulate tetraparvovirus belongs to Tetraparvovirus (previously proposed as ‘Partetravirus ’), that became an established genus in the Parvoviridae family in 2018 (Pan et al., 2019).Members of the family Parvoviridae are small, resistant, non-enveloped viruses with linear, single-stranded DNA genomes of 4 –6 kb.Viruses in two subfamilies, the Parvovirinae and Densovirinae , are distinguished 25International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( http://www.ictvonline.com )Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 41 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 primarily by their respective ability to infect vertebrates (including humans) vs.invertebrates (Cotmore et al., 2019).
d) Anelloviridae Chicken anaemia virus (CAV) is a 25-nm, non-enveloped, icosahedral virus with a very small (2.3 kb), single-stranded, negative sense, circular DNA genome. It is the only recognised member of the Gyrovirus genus of the Anelloviridae family.It was previously classi ﬁed as a Circovirus, but important differences in genome organisation led to its reclassi ﬁcation into the new Anelloviridae family.Horizontal transmission of CAV infection is by the faecal-oral route, possibly by therespiratory route, and through infected feather follicle epithelium.Contaminated litter is a commonsource of introduction.Vertical transmission may occur when seronegative hens become infectedand infection continues during egg laying until adequate levels of neutralising antibodies develop inthe hens.
CAV is ubiquitous throughout the world in poultry operations; infection of young chickens causes anaemia, decreased weight gain, transient immunosuppression and increased mortality (Fatoba and Adeleke, 2019). e) Circoviridae Duck circovirus (DuCV) is a small, round, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus with a circular genome and, being an immunosuppressive virus, it may increase the pathogenicity of coinfectingagents.The classic symptoms are generally considered to be feather disorders, poor body conditionand low weight for age (Liu et al., 2020).f) Reoviridae Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the aetiological agent of Bluetongue (BT), a non-contagious vector-borneviral disease of domestic and wild ruminants.BTV is a segmented double-stranded (dsRNA) virusbelonging to the genus Orbivirus of the family Reoviridae.It is transmitted through the bite of hematophagous midges of the Culicoides genus (Wilson and Mellor, 2009).
BTV is widely prevalent in sheep, goats, cattle, camels, deer and antelopes. Clinical presentation ranges from asymptomaticto mild fever, salivation, depression, dyspnoea and even abortion and death, leading to severeeconomic repercussions for livestock breeding (Gong et al., 2021).To obtain more information about the thermal and chemical resistance of these viral hazards, a literature search with the prede ﬁned search string and the respective viral hazard ( ﬁve non-enveloped DNA and four non-enveloped RNA viruses) was conducted, as described in Annex A.There was no need to include FMDV in the search because suf ﬁcient data were available from the REFRESH study data set (Hayrapetyan et al., 2019).3.6.Thermal inactivation data Thermal inactivation data for the relevant biological hazards were retrieved, when possible, from comprehensive review articles, like the one by Doyle and Mazzotta (2000) for S.Senftenberg and the one by S €orqvist (2003) for E.
faecalis , or from previous reports, such as the one of the REFRESH study (Hayrapetyan et al., 2019). Additionally, references of experimental studies retrieved through tailoredsearches performed as described in Section 2and Annex Awere also considered when necessary.3.6.1.Enterococcus faecalis ForE.faecalis , the literature search provided a review investigating the heat resistance of inter alia E.faecalis , however only in liquid matrices (S €orqvist, 2003).Therefore, it was decided to extract additional D-values on matrices with different characteristics from the non-review hits of the literaturesearch.The screening of title and abstract of the 71 references extracted from the search on thermal inactivation of E.faecalis produced a shortlist of four additional papers from which data were extracted: Ugwuanyi et al.(1999), Aguirre et al.(2009), Harris et al.(2012) and Saucier andPlamondon (2011).
The data from these different sources were consolidated and used to extractD-values at different heating temperatures and estimate the times needed to inactivate 5 log 10units as a function of the treatment temperature (Figure 4). Details of the data points used to produce Figure 4are displayed in Table A.1of Appendix A.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 42 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 3.6.2.Salmonella Senftenberg Data on thermal inactivation of S.Senftenberg were extracted from the review of studies on the thermal resistance of salmonellae by Doyle and Mazzotta (2000).D-values were extracted from studiescarried out in different matrices and plotted against the tested temperature.Then, those D T-values were used to estimate the times needed to inactivate 5 log 10units of S.Senftenberg as a function of the treatment temperature (Figure 5).
The analysis included thermal inactivation in different products (i.e. liquid whole eggs, liquid egg yolks, liquid egg whites, raw milk, ground beef, chocolate and culturemedia).It is generally acknowledged that water activity (a w)i n ﬂuences thermal inactivation of microorganisms, and that in matrices with high water content, the resistance of microorganisms tothermal inactivation is lower (Syamaladevi et al., 2016).It is also well known that some components ofthe matrices such as fat can have a protective effect on bacteria subjected to thermal treatments.Thiseffect was also evident in the thermal inactivation data set from Doyle and Mazzotta (2000), with S.Senftenberg showing D 60-values in high a wmatrices ranging from 0.122 min in raw milk to 11.8 min in liquid egg yolks, while in chocolate it showed a D 90-value of 36 min (Doyle and Mazzotta, 2000).
This provides evidence that the physico-chemical characteristics of the ABP or the raw materials used asfeedstock for the production of the derived products under assessment will impact on the levels ofreduction achieved. Details of the data points used to produce Figure 5are displayed in Table A.2of Appendix A.Orange: liquid matrix; grey: solid matrix; blue: semi-liquid matrix.Figure 4: Time –temperature combinations to achieve a 5 log 10reduction of Enterococcus faecalis in different matrices (mixed liquid, whole milk, ground beef, digestion waste) obtained fromthe literature search (S €orqvist (2003); Ugwuanyi et al.(1999), Aguirre et al.(2009), Harris et al.(2012) and Saucier and Plamondon (2011))Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 43 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 3.6.3.
Viruses Nims and Plavsic (2013d) conducted a systematic review analysis comparing four different viral families for their susceptibility to heat inactivation. Within the four viral families analysed, they foundthat Parvoviridae is by far the most heat-resistant viral family followed by Caliciviridae and Picornaviridae .However, their review is not extensive and does not include all the viral families of the hazards identi ﬁed in chapter 3.5.The results of the ELS, conducted on the viral families selected in the hazard identi ﬁcation following the approach described in Section 3.5, produced the results presented in Table 5.In the following sections, the data obtained by the literature review are presented in tabular form and/or through the graphical representation of the estimated times needed to achieve a 3 log 10 reduction of infectious virus per viral family, calculated from the D-values, in those cases whereenough data points were retrieved.

Papillomaviridae Data on the thermal inactivation of bovine papillomavirus and cottontail rabbit papillomavirus were not available in the reviewed papers. Only one study on human papillomavirus (HPV11) was retrievedand described the complete elimination of infectivity after a 60-min treatment at 60 °C (Smith et al., 1993).Summarised data from the references identi ﬁed in the literature for Papillomaviridae are displayed in Table A.3of Appendix A.3.6.3.2.Parvoviridae Ungulate tetraparvovirus ( Parvoviridae family) was identi ﬁed as a viral hazard for wool and hair (group 5).However, data on the thermal inactivation of Ungulate tetraparvovirus were not available inthe reviewed papers; therefore, data on other viruses of the family Parvoviridae were taken into consideration.
The data extracted included mainly thermal reduction data for canine, porcine or bovine parvovirus, derived from studies undertaken in a wide range of matrices, including human serum protein solution,human serum albumin, human plasma, manure, water and culture media. It is stated in the literaturethat Parvovirus B19 seems to be more susceptible to inactivation compared to other parvoviruses(Yunoki et al., 2003).For Parvoviridae , the time –temperature combinations providing >3 log 10reductions are more intense than those reported for other viral families (e.g.112 °C for 0.5 min for canine parvovirus in water; 101 °C for 0.5 min in water for bovine parvovirus; 117 °C for 0.5 min for minute virus of mice (MVM) in water; or 196 °C for 0.5 min for mice virus in culture media) (Nims and Plavsic, 2013c).
The times required to achieve a 3 log 10reduction at different temperatures, extracted or calculated from selected references of the literature review for Parvoviridae are displayed in Figure 6. Summarised data from the references identi ﬁed in the literature review for Parvoviridae are displayed in Table A.4of Appendix A.Orange: water; grey: culture media; yellow: semi-solid; blue: dried lyophilisate.Figure 6: Time –temperature combinations to achieve a 3 log 10reduction of Parvoviridae in different matrices (manure/faeces, mixed waste, dried lyophilisate, culture medium, water) obtainedfrom the literature review (Lund et al., 1996; Br €auniger et al., 2000; Yunoki et al., 2003; Sahlstr €om et al., 2008; EFSA AHAW Panel and EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2011, Nims and Plavsic, 2013c; Elving et al., 2014; Nims and Zhou, 2016)Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 45 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 3.6.3.3.
Picornaviridae Table A.5of Appendix Ashows the results of the literature search on swine vesicular disease virus and Senecavirus A, according to the search strategy presented in Section 3.5. However, speci ﬁc data on thermal inactivation were only available in the literature for swine vesicular disease, not for Senecavirus A.The data retrieved included mainly thermal reduction data for enterovirus, swine vesicular disease virus, poliovirus, infectious avian encephalomyelitis virus and FMDV, derived fromstudies undertaken in a wide range of matrices, including wastewater sludge, saline solution, manure,slurry, faeces, milk and culture media.Some of the studies in the literature reported >3 log 10 reductions at time/temperature combinations of relevance for the mandate, like 60 min at 70 °Ci n saline solution or manure for bovine enterovirus (Lund et al., 1996).
In the particular case of swinevesicular disease virus, complete inactivation has been reported after treatments of less than 5 min attemperatures ranging from 56 °Ct o6 0 °C in pig slurry (Turner et al., 1998; Turner and Williams, 1999). The times required to achieve a 3 log 10reduction at different temperatures, extracted or calculated from selected references of the literature review for Picornaviridae are displayed in Figure 7.Summarised data from the references identi ﬁed in the literature review for Picornaviridae are diplayed in Table A.5of Appendix A.3.6.3.4.Anelloviridae The data extracted from the literature on thermal inactivation of viruses belonging to the Anelloviridae family exclusively included thermal reduction data for chicken anaemia virus (CAV) obtained in human albumin, minced meat or chicken by-products.
According to the literature, >3 log 10 reductions are reached at time –temperature combinations of relevance for the mandate, like 30 min at 75°C in human albumin (Welch et al., 2006).

Data on Foot and Mouth Disease Virus were retrieved from the REFRESH Project (Hayrapetyan et al., 2019)Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 46 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 The times to achieve a 3 log 10reduction at different temperatures, extracted or calculated from the references of the literature review for Anelloviridae (CAV), are displayed in Figure 8. Summarised data from the references identi ﬁed in the literature review for Anelloviridae (Chicken anaemia virus) are displayed in Table A.6of Appendix A.3.6.3.5.Circoviridae Although the viral hazard identi ﬁed for feathers and down (Group 6) is Duck circovirus (family Circoviridae ), the data extracted exclusively included thermal reduction data for porcine circovirus in human albumin.According to the literature, certain time/temperature combinations of relevance for the mandate (e.g.
30 min at 75 °C, or 30 min at 120 °C with dry heat) produce log 10reductions <3 log10for this virus (Welch et al., 2006). These authors investigated the resistance of Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) and Chicken anaemia virus (CAV).The dry-heat treatment at 120 °C for 30 min led to approximately 1-log 10reduction in infectivity.The time to achieve a 3 log 10reduction at different temperatures, extracted or calculated from the references of the literature review for Circoviridae , are displayed in Figure 9.Summarised data from the references identi ﬁed in the literature review for Circoviridae are displayed in Table A.7 of Appendix A.Orange: liquid (human albumin).Figure 8: Time –temperature combinations to achieve a 3 log 10reduction of Anelloviridae obtained from the literature review (Welch et al.(2006))Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 47 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 3.6.3.6.
Reoviridae Data on the Bluetongue virus (BTV) were not available from the identi ﬁed literature. The data extracted were exclusively thermal reduction data for avian rotaviruses and reoviruses at mild heatingtemperatures of 56 –60°C, with variable results.Summarised data from the references identi ﬁed in the literature review for Reoviridae are provided in Table A.8of Appendix A.3.7.Chemical and thermo-chemical inactivation The application of the search string as described in Table A.1 of Annex Aproduced 74 hits, including two review articles, related to chemical and thermo-chemical inactivation of biologicalhazards and indicator microorganisms.The screen of title and abstracts looking for data on chemicalinactivation of the indicator microorganisms resulted in 38 references with potential data to extract.Out of these, 36 references were in English and reviewed in full.Data from 21 papers were extractedand a summary is provided in Tables 6–11.
In the other 15 papers, either data on parameters of the treatment applied or quanti ﬁcation of the reduction of the indicator microorganisms were not available. In various of these studies, the chemical process was accompanied by a thermal treatment at temperatures ranging from 50 °Ct o7 0 °C.Therefore, in these instances, the inactivation level attained is due to a combined thermo-chemical effect.It is noteworthy that some of the industrial processesunder assessment based on chemical inactivation (e.g.liming) are exothermic processes which releaseheat, causing a progressive increase in temperature in an uncontrolled manner.For example, as statedin EFSA BIOHAZ Panel (2010), the reaction between quicklime and the water of the manure isexothermic (1,140 kJ/kg of CaO) and at the correct dosage rate is suf ﬁcient to raise the temperature of the manure undergoing treatment of 70 °C for 30 min or 60 °C for 60 min.Similarly, Paluszak et al.
(2006) reported an increase of the temperature up to 60 °C only when the concentration of quicklime was at least 20% in sludge, causing a reduction of >5 log 10ofS. Senftenberg in 30 min.If the concentration of quicklime was 10% or 5%, the temperature never exceeded 30 °C, not adding any thermal effect to the inactivation.The assessment of chemical treatments that do not specify theminimum residence time but only the minimum pH to be reached is more uncertain about theirefﬁcacy to reduce/inactivate microbiological indicators.1101001,00010,000100,000 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200Time [min] 3D Temperature [°C] Orange: liquid (human albumin).Figure 9: Time –temperature combinations to achieve a 3 log 10reduction of Porcine circovirus 2 obtained from the literature review (Welch et al.

Enterococcus faecalis In EFSA BIOHAZ Panel (2010), the lime stabilisation of dewatered pig and poultry manures (pH 12, 30 min at 70 °C or 60 min at 60 °C) led to a 5 log 10reduction of Enterococcus faecalis (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2010).However, the level of inactivation when incorporating manure into a soil was dependent on soiltexture, with total inactivation in clay soil but not in sandy soil (still detectable after 15 days) (Nyberg et al., 2011).The high pH was critical for the inactivation of Enterococcus faecalis in the mixture of manure and soil and the minimum requirement for soil pH was 11.In a very different setting, E.faecalis is a common bacterium in persistent infections of dental surfaces.
Treatments with calcium hydroxide orcalcium hydroxide +sodium hypochlorite at pH 12.6 at 37 °C for 7 days produced only log 10reductions ranging from 1.48 to 2 log 10(Shokraneh et al., 2014).

Salmonella Senftenberg Chemical inactivation of Salmonella Senftenberg was evaluated in liquid media of low pH (apple and orange juice) (Alvarez-Ord /C19o~nez et al., 2009) or in sludge or dewatered pig and poultry manures (Paluszak et al., 2006; EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2010). In liquid media, D-values varied between 12.2 and54.9 minutes at pH 2.5, but as temperature increased D-values were reduced down to a few seconds.As for Enterococcus faecalis , the lime-treated dewatered pig and poultry manures (pH 12, 30 min at 70°C or 60 min at 60 °C) following a thermo-chemical treatment led to a 5 log 10reduction of S.Senftenberg (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2010).In sludge, a 5 log 10reduction was achieved in 30 min with a quicklime (CaO) concentration of 20% and in 12 hours with 10% quicklime (Paluszak et al., 2006).

However, the same treatment required much shorter time (even after 5 min) to observe inactivation at temperatures above 55 °C (Capizzi-Banas et al., 2004), leading to the conclusion that an increased temperature and pressureshortened the time needed for inactivation. Con ﬂicting results exist regarding the combination of time and temperature needed to reach the level of inactivation of 3 log 10ofAscaris sp.in these types of matrices (Eriksen et al., 1996; Jimenez et al., 2000; Capizzi-Banas et al., 2004; Paulsrud et al., 2004;Fitzmorris et al., 2007; EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2010), highlighting also the higher resistance of Ascaris eggs to inactivation, compared to larvae or adults.Summarised data from the references identi ﬁed in the literature review for Ascaris spp.

The EFSA opinion does not specify the concentration of quicklime in the substrate of the assessed method but citesOstertag (1987) recommending a dose of 200 g CaO/1,000 g of dry matter in sewage sludge, and statesthat ‘lime is also alkaline and a saturated solution (1.16 g/L) will impart a pH of 12.4 at 25 °C’.Full inactivation was observed in digested sludge after a lime treatment of 12 h (Strauch, 1983).In an acidic environment, the level of inactivation of Protoparvovirus was >3 log 10at pH 1.7 in both buffer solution after 8 min and serum after 8 h (Yang et al., 2020).

Integration of evidence on the ef ﬁcacy of the processes to reduce biological hazards and indicator microorganisms The current section integrates the available information retrieved on the thermal and chemical inactivation of the main biological hazards and indicator microorganisms to support the assessmentmade in the Expert Knowledge Elicitation (EKE) exercise on whether the processing standards for thedeclaration of the end points in the manufacturing chain or the standard or alternative methodsapproved for the production of derived products from the ABP in the list of materials achieve (i) areduction of 5 log 10ofEnterococcus faecalis orSalmonella Senftenberg (775W, H 2S negative) and a reduction of infectivity titre by at least 3 log 10of those thermoresistant viruses that were identi ﬁed as a relevant hazard (or of Parvoviridae, as a worse-case scenario, when no intrinsic viral hazards were identi ﬁed), and, in the case of chemical processes, also a reduction of eggs of Ascaris sp.
by 3 log 10 (Figure 10). 3.8.1.Ash derived from incineration, co-incineration and combustion A wide range of biological hazards may occur in the ABP raw materials before their incineration, co- incineration or combustion.However, bacteria, viruses and parasites are generally sensitive to heat andcannot survive normal burning temperatures.Prions are considered the most resistant biological Figure 10: Components of the framework protocol applied to the assessmentInactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 64 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 hazards.Even the risk of TSE infectivity from ash would be extremely small if incineration is conducted at 850 °C (SEAC, 2003).Indeed, the incineration at >850°C is recognised in the EU as the standard method for disposing of waste.26Therefore, ash derived from incineration, co-incineration or combustion is typically considered safe and may be disposed of in land ﬁlls.
Ash generated from incineration, co-incineration or combustion (carried out in accordance with Annex III of Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011) requires operating temperatures of 850 °C for at least 2 seconds or 1,100 °C for at least 0.2 s. ForEnterococcus faecalis , the collated data suggest that, for a time period of 2 s, greater than a 5 log 10reduction can be achieved at temperatures in excess of 98 °C.Similarly, for a time period of 0.2 s then greater than a 5 log 10reduction can be achieved with a temperature of over 110.5 °C.Both these temperatures (98 °C and 110.5 °C) are much lower than the operating temperatures of 850 °C and 1,100 °C (for the time intervals 2 and 0.2 s, respectively).In order to achieve a 5 log 10reduction of S.Senftenberg 775W within a 2-second time interval, the collated data suggest that temperatures of greater than 74 °C would be suf ﬁcient.
Similarly, to achieve a 5 log 10reduction of S.Senftenberg within a 0.2-s time interval a temperature of greater than 78.8 °C would be suf ﬁcient. Both temperatures (74 °C and 78.8 °C) are far below the temperatures experienced during thermal treatment by incineration, co-incineration or combustion.For viruses, from the data presented it is clear that at high process temperatures, the times required to achieve a 3 log 10reduction in the identi ﬁed viruses are signi ﬁcantly reduced.Parvovirus is particularly resistant to high temperatures.However, multiple studies have shown a reduction of over 3 log 10of parvovirus within short time periods, for example, Nims and Plavsic (2013b) reported a 4 log 10reduction in parvovirus in 0.5 min at temperatures of 101, 112, 117 °C in water, and 196 °C in culture media.3.8.2.
Glycerine derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels A wide range of bacterial, viral, parasitic, protozoan and fungal pathogens can be found in the feedstock materials used for biodiesel production. However, the esteri ﬁcation and transesteri ﬁcation steps and the ﬁnal vacuum distillation during biodiesel production have been considered to achieve a relevant reduction of biological hazards, including TSE agents, the most resilient pathogens (EFSABIOHAZ Panel, 2015, 2017, 2020, 2021).Biodiesel/glycerine production involves various thermal and chemical processes with capability to inactivate biological hazards.In the standard biodiesel production process, according to the EUlegislation, the Cat.2 or 3 ABP will be initially subjected to Method 1 (pressure sterilisation) in the caseof Cat.2 materials or methods 1 –7 in the case of Cat.
3 materials, followed by an esteri ﬁcation (at pH <1 by adding sulfuric acid or an equivalent acid and at 72 °C for at least 2 h 27), a transesteri ﬁcation (twice at pH ~14 with potassium hydroxide or with an equivalent base at 35 –50°C for at least 15 min), and a ﬁnal distillation at 150 °C, leading to the end-product biodiesel and the co-product glycerine. The thermal processes to be considered are: Method 1 (133 °C, 20 min 3 bar; if Cat.2 material is used as feedstock for biodiesel production) or Method 5 (80 °C 120 min and 100 °C 60 min; if Cat.3 material is used as feedstock for biodiesel production, method 5 being the least stringent in terms oftemperature of the ﬁrstﬁve processing methods of ABP according to Commission Regulation (EU) 142/ 2001).These processes alone have the capacity to signi ﬁcantly reduce the population of both S.Senftenberg and E.faecalis .
Thus, considering the data retrieved on the thermal resistance of these two microorganisms, short thermal treatments involving pasteurisation temperatures ( <100°C) resulted in D-values (times required for a 1 log 10reduction in the bacterial population at a given temperature) in most of the matrices of <1 min at temperatures ≥70°C. The exception was melted chocolate, a matrix known to have low water activity and high fat content, where S.Senftenberg showed D 80and D 90-values of 116 and 36 min, respectively (Doyle and Mazzotta, 2000).In addition, the subsequent esteri ﬁcation and transesteri ﬁcation processes, at 72 °C and 35 –50°C, respectively, and theﬁnal distillation at 150 °C, as well as the extreme acid (pH <1) and alkaline (pH ~14) conditions prevailing during these processes will also contribute to lethality.
Similarly, the harsh temperatures andpH conditions of the biodiesel/glycerine production process can also achieve a signi ﬁcant reduction of thermoresistant viruses, such as parvovirus. Thus, for example, a treatment for 0.5 min at 101 °C produced a reduction of 4 log 10of bovine parvovirus in water in the study by Nims and Plavsic 26Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste, as amended.https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2000/76/oj 27Esteri ﬁcation is not required for processed fat derived from Category 3 material.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 65 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 (2013b), and >3.3 log 10reductions of porcine parvovirus have been obtained after treatments of 8 min at pH 1.7 in buffer solution supplemented with pepsin by Yang et al.(2020).
Moreover, aquicklime (CaO) treatment of 30 min at 70 °C and pH 12 caused a >5 log 10reduction of S. Senftenberg and E.faecalis and a >3 log 10reduction of parvovirus in dewatered pig (28.5% dry matter content) and poultry (40% dry matter content) manure (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2010).Likewise, other renewable fuels may be produced, following the EU legislation, through multistep catalytic processes involving a thermal treatment at very high temperatures (e.g.250 °C at 20 bar for at least 20 min; 265 °C at 30 bar for at least 20 min).
It is worth highlighting that, as set out in Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009, alternative methods for the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels have been assessed by EFSA to ensurethat any risks to public or animal health are reduced to a degree that is at least equivalent to thatachieved by the processing methods that have already been approved for the same category of ABP .This is carried out by assessing whether the alternative methods achieve a relevant reduction, even forTSE agents, which are considered to be the most resistant biological hazards (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel,2011, 2017, 2020, 2021). 3.8.3.Other materials derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels The main by-products generated in the biodiesel and renewable fuels production processes are clay from bleaching and sludge from the pretreatment processes.These two by-products are generatedbefore some of the steps contributing lethality are applied in the production process (e.g.
before the esteri ﬁcation, transesteri ﬁcation and distillation steps, or the multistep catalytic treatment), but after the raw materials are subjected to Method 1 (for Cat. 2 ABP) or Method 1 –7 (for Cat.3 ABP).According to point D, Section 2, Chapter IV, Annex IV of Commission Regulation (EU) 142/2011 as amended, a fat fraction derived from ABP of all categories may be used for the production of biodiesel.Category 1 or Category 2 materials must be ﬁrst processed using processing Method 1 (pressure sterilisation: 20 min, 133 °C, 3 bar) as set out in Chapter III of the same Annex.According to point 2J and 2L,ﬁsh oil or rendered fats derived from Category 3 material can be used as a starting material, as long as they have been processed using any of the processing methods 1 –5 or processing method 7; or in the case of material derived from ﬁsh oil, any of the processing methods 1 –7.
As already mentioned, when dealing with the levels of reduction achieved throughout the production of glycerine, Method 1 and Method 5 have the capacity to inactivate S.Senftenberg, E. faecalis and parvovirus.For Category 3 material subject to the least stringent treatment in terms of temperature as a worst- case scenario (Method 5), the level of inactivation achieved for the relevant indicator microorganisms willbe lower than for Category material 2, treated with Method 1.As previously described, the thermalresistance of these microorganisms will be high in matrices with low a wlevels and high fat content (e.g.S.Senftenberg showed D 80and D 90-values in chocolate of 116 and 36 min, respectively (Doyle and Mazzotta, 2000) and E.faecalis showed D 88values of 0.36 min in raw almond kernels (Harris et al., 2012)).There are some reports showing a >3 log 10reduction of parvovirus under similar time/ temperature scenarios as those of Method 5 (e.g.
a treatment for 0.5 min at 101 °C produced a reduction of 4 log 10of Bovine parvovirus in water in the study by Nims and Plavsic (2013b)). On other occasions, a lower reduction level has been documented, e.g.a D 80-value of 23.6 min has been estimated for Bovine parvovirus based on the thermal inactivation data reported at different temperatures by Nims and Zhou(2016), which would result in a time of 70.8 min required at 80 °C to reach a 3 log 10reduction of this viral indicator.3.8.4.Hides and skins In terms of the processes that may result in a reduction or elimination of indicator microorganisms during the treatment and post-treatment (processing) of hides and skins, the ﬁrst one to be assessed is the process for untreated hides and skins as described in the legislation and in Section 3.2.4 ,b y applying one of the ﬁve available options.
Excluding option (e) preservation process other than tanning, and (a) dried, option (d) allows the treatment of hides and skins by drying for a period of atleast 42 days at a temperature of at least 20 °C. This option would reduce the humidity of the raw material but would have uncertain, although limited, ability to reduce the indicator microorganisms.The other two options (b) and (c) include the addition of salt, and an extra alkaline additive in the case of (c).
In both cases, a higher degree of inactivation is expected than for (a), (d) or (e).Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 66 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Once the hides and skins are preserved, the steps that may result in a reduction or elimination of indicator microorganisms during the processing for the production of treated hides and skins to beplaced in the market without restrictions include: Limed hides: –the physical removal of blood, ﬂesh, fat and hair including the full epidermis –the chemical liming treatments, which include the immersion in brine of lime at a pH 12 – 13 for at least 8 h.
Pickled pelts: –the physical removal of blood, ﬂesh, fat and hair including the full epidermis –the chemical treatments, which include multiple immersion in alkaline solutions of pH > 8.5 and pH > 12 for variable time periods, usually several hours, followed by acidicsolutions at pH < 3, also for several hours. –the splitting, which can separate the grain, i.e.the external layer above the corium, fromthe grain and corium junction and the corium, which results in what is also called by theleather industry as split leather.–bactericides and fungicides can be added to the resulting material, the pickled pelt. ‘Wet blue ’: –there is no difference compared to the pickled pelts because the addition of chromium salts and alkaline buffers do not change the conditions of the material to produce further reduction of the indicator microorganisms or their elimination if this has not occurred yet during pickling.
Hides and skins that have undergone the complete process of tanning: –there is no difference compared to the pickled pelts or the wet blues because theaddition of tanning agents, the removal of fat, the drying and the coating are notexpected to contribute to a further reduction of the indicator microorganisms or theirelimination if this has not occurred yet during pickling and wetting. Hides and skins are the ﬁrst group of materials included in the mandate that are subject only to chemical treatment.The different steps of the pretreatment cause the physical removal of tissues notintrinsic to the raw material that could contain indicator microorganisms or parasites: fat, blood, connective tissue, etc.However, the most important factor associated with hazard reduction is the alkaline treatment for ‘limed hides ’at pH 12 –13 for 8 h and the subsequent acidic treatment of pH <3 for circa 16 h for ‘pickled pelts ’,‘wet blue ’and ‘hides/skins undergoing complete tanning.
Enterococcus faecalis is a well-known thermoresistant non-spore-forming bacterium that also has a high pH tolerance (Shokraneh et al., 2014), being able to grow over a wide range of pH: 4 –11 (Nakajo et al., 2005). The matrix considerably in ﬂuences the level of inactivation of E.faecalis .For example, in dewatered pig manure with a total solid content of 28.5% and maximum particle size of 12 mm atreatment of quicklime (CaO) at 70 °C and pH >12 achieved the 5 log 10reduction in a matter of 30 min (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2010).The same level of inactivation was achieved for S.Senftenberg, and the required 3 log 10for parvovirus and Ascaris eggs.At lower temperature, the same treatment in horse manure and soil mixtures required up to 48 hours to achieve the 5 log 10reduction of E.faecalis (Nyberg et al., 2011).Despite having less data, similar behaviour has been observed with S.Senftenberg ,also known to be thermoresistant and to be able to survive in acidic environments.
In a set of experiments in liquidmatrices (fruit juices) with a pH adjusted to 2.5 at 37 °CS. enterica serovar Senftenberg CECT 4348 showed D-values ranging between 12.2 and 54.9 min, depending on the matrix ( /C19Alvarez-Ord /C19o~nez et al., 2009).In addition to the reduction caused by alkaline and acidic treatments, the salt applied to hides and skins as a preservative before starting the treatment process can also cause bacterial death due toosmotic shock (Davidson and Taylor, 2001) or retarded growth due to the reduction of a win the matrix and the limited oxygen availability interfering with cellular enzymes (Shelef and Seiter, 2005).
The viral hazards identi ﬁed in hides and skins were: Papillomaviridae (bovine papillomavirus, cottontail rabbit papillomavirus), Reoviridae (bluetongue virus), and Picornaviridae (FMDV, SVDV).Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 67 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Starting with Picornaviridae , multiple viruses of this family (human enterovirus, FMDV, Equine rhinovirus) were reduced by >3 log 10in cell cultures at 20 °C with pH values of 3, 4 and 5 in 15 min whereas other viruses of the same family ( Cardiovirus, porcine teschovirus, bovine and other enterovirus) did not reach such levels of reduction under similar conditions (Nims and Zhou, 2016).
Ina different substrate with an alkaline treatment, poliovirus in raw sewage sludge was fully inactivatedin 30 min at pH 12 with a treatment of 3 kg/m 3calcium oxide (CaO), and in 360 min in digested sludge under the same treatment, while reovirus was inactivated at the same level after 180 min(Koch and Strauch, 1981). Mixed raw and humus sludge subject to ﬁlter pressing and liming at pH 10–11 achieved a full inactivation of enteroviruses, with the authors arguing that the high pH was enough to inactivate poliovirus and reovirus (Goddard et al., 1982).The same results were reported byBosch et al.(1986) in raw sludge under the same treatment for 30 min at pH =12.However, in these studies from the early 80s, there was no measurement of the reduction of the virus due to thedifﬁculty of homogenising the raw material and measuring the initial viral load.No data were available on the chemical inactivation of papillomaviruses.
For chemical treatment only, the requirements for alternative transformation parameters for biogas and composting also include the demonstration of a reduction of resistant parasites such as eggs of Ascaris sp. by at least 99.9% (3 log 10) of viable stages.Ascaris are helminths known for their resistance to extreme conditions; hence, their use as an indicator for effective treatment of biosolids, sewage sludge, etc.Ascaris eggs may survive within a wide range of temperature (40 –108°C), humidity (5 –55%) and pH (9 –13) (Maya et al., 2010), due to multiple layers acting as a natural barrier.Most of the treatments applied to the substrates asdescribed in Table 8are applied in aerobic conditions and at room temperature even though the chemical reactions after the application of chemicals like quicklime, slaked lime, etc., liberate heat,increasing the temperature and the dry solid content due to evaporation.
In general, in matrices with total solid contents of 20% or lower, in which the pH has been increased to 12 or above with the consequent increase in temperature, all adult worms and larvae would be totally inactivated aftera short period of time (less than 1 h). For example, quicklime (pH >12) reaching 55 °C achieved a 2.7 log 10reduction of viable Ascaris in dewatered sludge in 40 min and 3 –3.4 log 10reductions in aerobic sludge under the same conditions (Brisolara and Reimers, 2013).Ascaris eggs, however, are more resistant.If the humidity is high and the temperature equals room temperature, the time required to achieve the 3 log 10reduction of Ascaris eggs will be longer, in some cases, up to several days.For example, addition of 20% CaO to sludge would kill all Ascaris suum eggs after 6 hours (Paluszak et al., 2006), while quicklime at 60 °C and pH of 12 in dewatered pig and poultry manure would achieve a 3 log 10reduction in Ascaris eggs after 60 min.3.8.5.
Wool and hair The hydrolysis of wool with superheated water in a laboratory scale microwave reactor at different temperatures was studied by Zoccola et al. (2015) and optimised at 170 °C for 60 min with a solid to liquor ratio close to 1.No speci ﬁc data are available in the literature regarding the duration of factory washing processes for wool and hair.Nonetheless, according to the sparse information available, it is performed withsolutions with pH values >12–13.Alkaline hydrolysis is performed with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide characterised by pH values >12.According to the literature available for wool and hair, alkaline hydrolysis is often associated with a thermal treatment at 120 –170°C for 20 –60 min.
Since the papers reported above (Section 3.2.5 ) indicate a time period for the duration of alkaline hydrolysis ranging between 20 and 60 min, the WG considered the following time scenarios for the evaluation of the ef ﬁcacy of the treatments: 5 min (as worst-case scenario) and 60 min. There are few data available on the inactivation of S.Senftenberg and E.faecalis by alkaline treatments.However, a 30-min treatment with quicklime at 70 °C and pH >12 achieved, in dewatered pig manure with a total solid content of 28.5% and maximum particle size of 12 mm, a 5 log 10 reduction for both indicator microorganisms (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2010).Table 4shows that the viruses identi ﬁed as relevant hazards in wool and hair are Picornaviridae (FMDV) and Parvoviridae (Ungulate tetraparvovirus).
No speci ﬁc data are available on the inactivation of FMDV at pH 12 but for Picornaviridae Koch and Strauch (1981) demonstrated the inactivation of poliovirus in raw sludge after a treatment of 30 min with 3 kg/m3CaO. According to Capizzi-Banas et al.(2004), no viable eggs of Ascaris sp.can be detected in sewage sludge at pH >12 after a treatment of 5 min at 58 °C.A 30-min treatment with quicklime (CaO) at 70 °CInactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 68 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 and pH >12 achieved, in dewatered pig manure with a total solid content of 28.5% and maximum particle size of 12 mm, a 3 log 10reduction of parvovirus and Ascaris spp.(EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2010).3.8.6.Feathers and down The treatment of feathers and down can include (1) washing/degreasing and (2) thermal treatment with hot steam at 100 °C for at least 30 min.
As previously mentioned, considering the data retrieved on the thermal resistance of S.Senftenberg and E. faecalis , short thermal treatments involving pasteurisation temperatures ( <100°C) would be suf ﬁcient to achieve a 5 log 10reduction of these two indicator microorganisms, which show D-values in most of the matrices of <1 min at temperatures ≥70 min.For example, Saucier and Plamondon (2011) demonstrated that Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 7080 cultivated in BHI and ME2 media, respectively, spiked in ground beef and then treated in a waterbath at 70 °C displayed mean D-values of 0.19 min and 0.15 min, respectively.Doyle and Mazzotta (2000) reported that S.Senftenberg in ground beef heated to 68 °C displayed a mean D-value of 0.22 min.Exceptions include those matrices with low water activity and high fat content, such as melted chocolate, where S.Senftenberg showed D 80-valuesand D 90-values of 116 min and 36 min, respectively (Doyle and Mazzotta, 2000).
However, the washing and thermal treatment with steam willadd moisture to the raw material, thus favouring the inactivation, as compared to a totally dried matrixor the application of dry heat. Table 4summarises the viruses which have been identi ﬁed as relevant hazards in feathers and down.The most thermoresistant, represented by the non-enveloped DNA viruses, were CAV belongingto the family Anelloviridae , and Duck circovirus, belonging to the family Circoviridae .According to Urlings et al.(1993), a 5 log 10reduction was achieved, after a treatment of 100 °C for 10 min or 95 °C for 30 min, for CAV, which was not detected in minced meat from chicken carcasses experimentally infected with the virus after heating in a stirred water bath.The same result wasobtained when testing minced meat supplemented with 4% w/w dextrose heated in a stirred waterbath.Welch et al.
(2006) quanti ﬁed a 1 log 10reduction in the level of CAV in human serum albumin after a dry heat treatment at 120 °C for 30 min. Finally, in chicken by-products, CAV was inactivated at 100°C after 10 min (EFSA AHAW Panel and EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2011).No data were available on the thermal inactivation of Duck circovirus.The data extracted exclusively included thermal reduction data for porcine circovirus and showed that treatments of 30 min at 75 °C, or 30 min at 120 °C (with dry heat) produce log reductions <3 log 10(Welch et al., 2006).3.8.7.Pig bristles For pig bristles, the standard against which the level of inactivation of indicator microorganisms was assessed was aboiling, i.e.immersion of the raw material in water at no less than 100 °C for a determined period of time.
Given the absence of any minimum time speci ﬁed in the legislation, it was agreed to assess two scenarios for different times, 5 min (as worst-case scenario) and 60 min, for theevaluation of the ef ﬁcacy of the treatments. According to the thermal inactivation data gathered and described in Section 3.6 for S.Senftenberg, most of the data con ﬁrmed that the 5 log 10can be achieved in a very short time (<5 min) at temperatures of 70 °C or above.The only data points which are well above the two time/ temperature combinations under assessment are those measured in matrices with high fat content (melted chocolate).For E.faecalis , there are no data points in which the 5 log 10level of inactivation required longer than the shortest time under assessment, i.e.5 min.No virus was identi ﬁed intrinsically in pig bristles during the virial hazard identi ﬁcation.Thus, the Parvoviridae family was used as the indicator virus against which to assess the ef ﬁcacy of the processing method.
Despite the high heat resistance of this virus, the conditions of boiling in water at100°C seem to cause a signi ﬁcant reduction of parvovirus. At 103 °C, Lelie et al.(1987) reported total inactivation of Canine parvovirus in human serum protein solution in 1.5 min.In a similar substrate,human plasma, 300 min was needed to reduce 4 log 10applying dry heat at 100 °C (Br €auniger et al., 2000).In water, a 1 log 10reduction occurred in 0.5 min at 94 °C for Bovine parvovirus, needing 101 °C to achieve a 4 log 10reduction in the same time (Nims and Plavsic, 2013b).In matrices with more solid content, like manure mixed with bleaching clay, 660 min was needed to achieve 4 log 10reduction of porcine parvovirus at 55 °C (Lund et al., 1996), and 1,019 min to reduce 1 log 10of porcine parvovirus at 49 °C in bovine faeces (Elving et al., 2014).
Sauerbrei and Wutzler (2009), cited by EFSA BIOHAZ Panel (2011), concluded that Bovine parvovirus was not signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced by dry heat at 95 °C for 120 min.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 69 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 As the papers reported above (Section 3.2.7 ) indicate a time period for the duration of the alkaline hydrolysis ranging between 20 and 60 min, the WG considered the following time scenarios for theevaluation of the ef ﬁcacy of the treatments: 5 min (as worst-case scenario) and 60 min. 3.8.8.Horns, horn products, hooves and hoof products According to the legislation, for the placing on the market of horns and horn products, excluding horn meal, and hooves and hoof products, excluding hoof meal, intended for the production of organicfertilisers or soil improvers, they shall be subject to a heat treatment for 1 hour at a core temperatureof at least 80 °C.
As previously mentioned, considering the data retrieved on the thermal resistance of S.Senftenberg and E. faecalis , short thermal treatments involving pasteurisation temperatures (<100°C) showed D-values in most of the matrices of <1 min at temperatures ≥70°C.The exception are those matrices with low a wand high fat content, such as melted chocolate, where S.Senftenberg showed D 80-value and D 90-value of 116 min and 36 min, respectively, in experiments conducted with cells grown to stationary phase and then inoculated into melted chocolate and heated to the targettemperature (Doyle and Mazzotta, 2000).In terms of virus, Table 4shows that the virus identi ﬁed as a relevant hazard for hooves and horns isSenecavirus (Picornaviridae ).According to literature search results reported in Section 3.6, speci ﬁc data on thermal inactivation were only available for ‘swine vesicular disease ’, not for ‘Senecavirus A ’.
However, data were retrieved on thermal inactivation of other Picornaviridae family members (Table A.5). El-Senousy et al.(2020) reported 1.2 log 10reductions of human hepatitis A virus (Picornaviridae ) after 2 min at 80 °C.
Other authors (Knight et al., 2013) reviewed the thermal inactivation of animal virus pathogens including Picornaviridae, indicating for small ssRNA non- enveloped viruses D-values of 10 s at a temperature of 70 –74°C.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 70 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Table 12: Sources of uncertainty associated with the AQs and their possible impact on the conclusions Source of uncertaintyCause of the uncertainty Impact of the uncertainty on the conclusions Ascertainment of the standard processesfor hides and skinsThe treatments applied to hides and skins for three of the four types of products declared end points were ascertained by searching in the scienti ﬁc literature and from industry information in grey literature.
The steps and conditions of the treatments could vary except for the lime hides which are speci ﬁed in the legislationIf the actual treatments applied for the production of pickled pelts, wet blues and tanned hides and skins are different thanthose described in Section 3, this could result in the higher or lower inactivation of the indicator microorganisms and biological hazards. Including pretreatment may result in greaterinactivation Treatment of hides and skins beforeprocessingThe hides and skins before going into tanning must be treated according to Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011, which means they are (a) dried; (b)dry-salted or wet-salted for a period of at least 14 days before dispatch; (c) saltedfor a period of at least 7 days in sea salt with the addition of 2% of sodium carbonate; (d) dried for a period of at least 42 days at a temperature of at least 20°C; or (e) subject to a preservation process other than tanning.
The potential reduction of indicator microorganisms during this treatment has not been consideredIt is expected that some level of reduction will occur due to the treatment of hides and skins, resulting in a higher reduction ofthe indicator microorganisms in the entire process (treatmentand processing of the four conditions for the declaration of end points) Standard or alternative methodsfor the production of derived products using Category 3materialsThe methods to be applied to Category 3 materials in the pre-processing of fat for the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels range from Method 1 to Method 7,which have very different parameters in terms of temperature and time combinations. Method 7 requires microbiological criteria ensuring the absence of Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens , and certain level of Enterococcus spp.
Method 5 is the least stringent in terms of temperature of those with explicit parameters in terms of temperature, while Method 6 only applies to aquatic animals/aquatic invertebrates. It was decided to apply as worst-case scenario theleast stringent method in terms of temperature (i.e.Method 5)Depending on the method applied to the raw Category 3 material, the inactivation of the indicator microorganisms in theraw material could be higher than the estimated inactivation on the basis of the conditions given for Method 5, except for Method 7, which could result in a higher or lower inactivationlevel Ascertainment of the transformationprocesses for the declaration of the end points for wooland hairCommission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 does not identify speci ﬁc technical parameters for the declaration of the end point for wool and hair, and theinformation retrieved from the literature on the processing of these ABP was scarce.
Based on the background information two scenarios were selected to be assessed (pH >12, 5 min; pH >12, 60 min). There is the possibility that these two scenarios do not fully re ﬂect current industrial practicesThis may result in an over- or underestimation of the level of hazard reduction achieved4.Uncertainty analysis www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 71 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers Source of uncertaintyCause of the uncertainty Impact of the uncertainty on the conclusions Ascertainment of the processes for pig bristlesCommission Regulation (EU) 142/2011 does not identify speci ﬁc technical parameters for the declaration of the end point of pig bristles, and the information retrieved from the literature on the processing of these ABP materials was scarce.Based on the background information, two scenarios were selected for being assessed (boiling at 100 °C for 5 or 60 min).
There is the possibility that these two scenarios do not fully re ﬂect current industrial practicesThis may result in an over- or underestimation of the level of hazard reduction achieved Nature of the chemical processesSome of the processes under assessment based on chemical inactivation (e.g. liming) are exothermic processes which release heat causing a progressive increasein temperature in an uncontrolled manner.Therefore, the inactivation level attained in these processes may derive from combined thermo-chemical effectsThis may result in the overestimation of the level of inactivation of indicator microorganisms achieved by the chemical processesalone, due to the combination of both thermal and chemical effects Identi ﬁcation of viral hazardsThe viral hazards that may occur in the ABP listed in the mandate were identi ﬁed through literature searches using search strings, as described in the data andmethodologies section.
There is the possibility that some relevant reference was not identi ﬁed or considered. It is also possible that the occurrence of virus in general, or certain families, in particular, have never been investigatedAs a result, it could be the case that some relevant virus was overlooked.This could impact on the conclusions only if somerelevant heat- or chemical-resistant virus (e.g.non-enveloped viruses) was overlooked Inactivation data Relevant references for extraction of data on thermal and chemical reduction/ inactivation of indicator microorganisms were identi ﬁed through literature searches using search strings, as described in the data and methodologies section.
There isthe possibility that some relevant reference was not identi ﬁed or considered for data extractionThis source of uncertainty could lead to either higher or lower inactivation of indicator microorganisms Inactivation data The data extracted on thermal and chemical reduction/inactivation of indicator microorganisms were sourced from experimental studies using different matrices tothose included in the mandate. There are no speci ﬁc data available from studies involving spiking the materials included in the mandate with the indicator microorganisms of interest.The different composition in terms of dry matter (totalsolid contents, a w), fat content, etc.determines the capacity of bacteria, viruses and parasites to survive under different conditions of temperature, time and pHThe capacity of the standard processes to achieve the targeted reductions may be higher or lower than estimated in thematerials included in the mandate.
In general, the materials have a low water content, while most inactivation data retrieved from the literature derive from studies using liquid media or foods. Asmicrobial inactivation by heat and chemical processes is lower in systems with low water activity, estimations from studies on liquid media or on foods with high water activity could result inan overestimation of the inactivation of the group of materials included in the mandate by the transformation processes Inactivation data The data extracted on thermal and chemical reduction/inactivation of indicator microorganisms were sourced from experimental studies using particular strains/ isolates of the relevant hazards and different analytical methods, which, for viral hazards, are not standardised.
It is uncertain whether they are representative ofthe behaviour of the whole speciesThis source of uncertainty could lead to either higher or lower inactivation of the viral hazards www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 72 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers Source of uncertaintyCause of the uncertainty Impact of the uncertainty on the conclusions Inactivation data The data retrieved on thermal inactivation of indicator microorganisms contained information on certain heating temperatures, that in some cases were far from the temperatures under assessment. An extrapolation to temperatures much higherthan those used to calculate D- and Z-values might not be accurate.
The data extracted on chemical reduction/inactivation of indicator microorganisms were sourced from experimental studies using pH values and concentrations of agents inmost cases different from those of the processing methods under assessment, and it is not possible from the available data to calculate equivalent inactivation levels at different pH values and concentrations of agentsThis source of uncertainty could lead to either higher or lower inactivation predicted for the indicator microorganisms Inactivation data Some of the references retrieved lacked details on the initial load and/or the level of inactivation of the hazard.
The data extracted were expressed as presented by the authors without any quantitative presentation or inclusion in the corresponding graphThis could lead to an under- or overestimation of the level of reduction achieved by the treatments described in those papers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 73 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers 5. Answers to AQ 2, 4 and 5, obtained by expert knowledge elicitation Following the procedure outlined in Section 2and Annex A, an EKE was performed to answer AQ2, AQ4 and AQ5.The experts were requested to express the uncertainty about their judgements; that is how sure they were that the speci ﬁed log 10reductions are achieved.In line with the EFSA ’s Guidance on Uncertainty Analysis in Scienti ﬁc Assessment (EFSA Scienti ﬁc Committee, 2018a), these uncertainties were expressed quantitatively, as probabilities.
Potential variability in performance of theprocesses is addressed by asking whether speci ﬁed reductions are obtained in more than 99% of cases, it is not included in the probability estimates given by the experts. The following EKE questions were answered for each of the transformation processes for the declaration of the end points in the manufacturing chain (for raw materials) and the approved standard or alternative methods (for derived products), described for the different materials as in the answer to AQ1: What is the probability that a 5 log 10reduction of E.faecalis is achieved, in more than 99% of cases, by application of the relevant process/es, assuming that the process/es is/are performed as prescribed and that the indicated process conditions are achieved?
What is the probability that a 5 log 10reduction of Salmonella Senftenberg (775 W, H2S negative) is achieved, in more than 99% of cases, by application of the relevant process/es,assuming that the process/es is/are performed as prescribed and that the indicated processconditions are achieved? What is the probability that a 3 log 10reduction of parvovirus or the identi ﬁed most resistant viruses is achieved, in more than 99% of cases, by application of the relevant process/es, assuming that the process/es is/are performed as prescribed and that the indicated process conditions are achieved?What is the probability that a 3 log 10reduction of eggs of Ascaris sp.is achieved, in more than 99% of cases, by application of the relevant chemical process/es, assuming that the process/es is/are performed as prescribed and that the indicated process conditions are achieved?
Expert judgements were obtained for three or four indicators in 16 combinations of transformation processes in the eight groups of materials considered, yielding a total of 52 combinations for whichprobability ranges, expressing the certainty that the indicated reductions are achieved, were produced. As explained in Appendix C(EKE report), the ﬁrst step of the EKE consisted of the individual judgements of the eight experts participating in the EKE, based on the evidence presented in thisscienti ﬁc opinion, the Uncertainty Table and their individual expertise.For most combinations, the judgements of the experts differed considerably (see Appendix C).In Step 2 of the EKE, the experts met and agreed on a consensus judgement for all 52 combinations, based on their individual judgements and an exchange of arguments.
These consensusjudgements provided a probability range for each of the 52 combinations, which re ﬂects the uncertainty of the experts and expresses the likelihood that the log reductions described in theRegulations are achieved. The results of the consensus EKE are given in Table 13and Figure 11.www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 74 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers Table 13: Material/process/hazard combinations included in the EKE and results of the consensus judgement MaterialTransformation processes for the declaration of the end points and approved standard or alternativemethods to produce derived productsTreatmentIndicator microorganism and required reduction S.Senftenberg (5 log 10)E.faecalis (5 log 10)Ascaris eggs (3 log 10)Parvovirus (or virus/ viruses as in the hazard identi ﬁcation) (3 log 10) 1) Ash derived from incineration Parvoviridae 1.1.850°C>2s T 9 9 –100% 99 –100% 99 –100% 1.2.

Conclusions Three types of materials were evaluated in this mandate as follows: (a) derived products after approved standard or alternative transformation processes are applied, as per CommissionRegulation (EU) No 142/2011, to Category 2 and Category 3 ABP (Group 1), fat fractions of ABP (Group 2) or rendered fats (Group 3); (b) materials for which Commission Regulation (EU) 142/2011 establishes speci ﬁc technical parameters of the transformation processes for the declaration of the end points in the manufacturing chain (Groups 4, 5 and 6); and (c) materialsfor which Commission Regulation (EU) 142/2011 establishes technical parameters of thetransformation processes for the placement in the market (Groups 7 and 8). It was assessed whether the technical parameters identi ﬁed or selected in AQ1 meet the requirements for alternative transformation parameters for biogas and composting plants,referred to in point 1 of Section 2 of Chapter III of Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 142/2011.
For Groups 5 and 7, Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 does not provide speci ﬁc technical parameters, such as time, for the transformation processes. Consequently, theapproach followed was to assess whether the requirements are met in two different timescenarios: 5 min and 60 min.For Groups 2 and 3, where the standard processing methods ofABP applied for Category 3 ABP are not speci ﬁed in Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011, the two combinations of time and temperature of Method 5 (the one of the ﬁrstﬁve methods at the lowest temperature) were considered in the assessment separately, despite the legalrequirement of the two combinations to be achieved.In the ﬁnal answer, the overall judgment for the entire process was made.The impact of the particle size was not taken into account.For all groups, it was assessed whether the transformation processes can achieve a reduction of 5 log 10ofE.
faecalis orS.Senftenberg (775W, H 2S negative) (AQ2) and a reduction of at least 3 log 10of parvovirus or thermoresistant viruses identi ﬁed as relevant hazards for the speci ﬁc materials (AQ4). For processes involving a chemical treatment, the reduction of eggs ofAscaris sp.by 3 log 10was also assessed (AQ5).
The thermoresistant non-enveloped viruses identi ﬁed as relevant hazards were (AQ3): – Group 4 (Hides and skins): Papillomaviridae (Bovine papillomavirus, Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus), Reoviridae (Bluetongue virus) and Picornaviridae (Foot and mouth disease virus, Swine vesicular disease virus) – Group 5 (Wool and hair): Picornaviridae (Foot and mouth disease virus), and Parvoviridae (Ungulate tetraparvovirus) – Group 6 (Feathers and down): Anelloviridae (Chicken anaemia virus) and Circoviridae (Duck circovirus) – Group 8 (Horns, horn products, hooves and hoof products): Picornaviridae (Senecavirus A) For the other groups of ABP (Groups 1, 2, 3 and 7), no viral hazards were identi ﬁed and Parvoviridae were used as indicators as a worst-case scenario to assess the ef ﬁcacy of the processes at inactivating viral hazards. There is no evidence of the intrinsic presence of some of these microorganisms in thematerials under assessment.
They are indicators used for the approval of alternative methodsfor biogas and compost production. An expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) was undertaken considering the available evidence,existing data gaps and uncertainties to provide the answer to AQ2, AQ4 and AQ5.Thecombinations of materials and processes were judged for each of the relevant indicatormicroorganisms and biological hazards.The probability range estimates obtained for the most resistant indicator microorganisms and biological hazards were selected as the worst-case scenario to describe the uncertainty around the ef ﬁcacy of the transformation processes (i.e.the required log 10reduction is achieved in at least 99% of cases).The probability that these processes achieve the required level of inactivation is always higherfor other than the most resistant indicator microorganisms and biological hazards in eachcombination of material and treatment.
Following this criterion, the EKE led to the followingconclusions:Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 78 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 1) Ash derived from incineration, co-incineration and combustion: – It was judged 99 –100% certain that the transformation processes, as de ﬁned in the legislation (850 °C, >2 s; 1,100 °C, >0.2 s), are able to reduce, to the required extent, the three indicator microorganisms ( E. faecalis ,S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ).2) Glycerine derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels: – For Category 2 ABP , it was judged 98 –100% certain that the transformation process, as de ﬁned in the legislation (Method 1 at 133 °C, 20 min, 3 bar, followed by esteri ﬁcation and transesteri ﬁcation), is able to reduce, to the required extent, the three indicator microorganisms ( E.faecalis ,S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ).
– For Category 3 ABP , it was judged 90 –95% and 90 –99% certain that the transformation processes, as de ﬁned in the legislation (80 °C for 120 min and 100 °C for 60 min, followed by transesteri ﬁcation), are able to reduce, to the required extent, Parvoviridae , the most resistant of the three indicator microorganisms (E. faecalis ,S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ).Since method 5 must ensure that the two time –temperature combinations are met, even if they were assessed separately, it is considered at least 90 –99% certain that the transformation process is able to reduce, to the required extent, Parvoviridae , the most resistant of the three indicator microorganisms ( E.faecalis, S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ).
3) Other materials derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels: – For Category 2 ABP, it was judged 90 –99% certain that the transformation process, as de ﬁned in the legislation (Method 1 at 133 °C, 20 min 3 bar), is able to reduce, to the required extent, the three indicator microorganisms ( E. faecalis , S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ).– For Category 3 ABP , it was judged 33 –90% and 66 –90% certain that the transformation processes, as de ﬁned in the legislation (80 °C for 120 min and 100 °C for 60 min, respectively), are able to reduce, to the required extent, Parvoviridae , the most resistant of the three indicator microorganisms ( E.faecalis , S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ).
Since method 5 must ensure that the two time – temperature combinations are met, even if they were assessed separately, it isconsidered at least 66 –90% certain that the transformation process is able to reduce, to the required extent, Parvoviridae , the most resistant of the three indicator microorganisms ( E. faecalis, S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ).4) Hides and skins: – It was judged 10 –66% and 33 –66% certain that the transformation processes, as deﬁned in the legislation (pH 12 –13 for 8h, and pH 12 for > 8 h followed by pH < 3 for 16 h, respectively), are able to reduce, to the required extent, eggs of Ascaris sp., the most resistant of the six biological hazards and indicator microorganisms ( E.faecalis , S.Senftenberg, Papillomaviridae ,Reoviridae ,Picornaviridae and eggs of Ascaris sp.).
5) Wool and hair: – It was judged 1 –33% and 10 –50% certain that the transformation processes, as deﬁned in the legislation (pH > 12 –13), applied for 5 min or 60 min, respectively, are able to reduce, to the required extent, eggs of Ascaris sp., the most resistant of the ﬁve biological hazards and indicator microorganisms ( E. faecalis , S.Senftenberg, Picornaviridae ,Parvoviridae and eggs of Ascaris sp.).–The results of these two-time scenarios revealed that the uncertainty for the efﬁcacy of the transformation processes for wool and hair is very much dependent on the time of application.Longer times would result in the reduction of uncertainty on the ef ﬁcacy of the process.
6) Feathers and down: – It was judged 66 –90% certain that the transformation process, as de ﬁned in the legislation (100 °C for at least 30 min), is able to reduce, to the required extent,Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 79 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Anelloviridae and Circoviridae , the most resistant of the four biological hazards and indicator microorganisms ( E. faecalis ,S.Senftenberg, Anelloviridae and Circoviridae ).7) Pig bristles: – It was judged 33 –66% and 50 –95% certain that the transformation process, as deﬁned in the legislation (100 °C), applied for 5 min or 60 min, respectively, is able to reduce, to the required extent, Parvoviridae , the most resistant of the three indicator microorganisms and biological hazards ( E.faecalis ,S.Senftenberg and Parvoviridae ).
–The results of these two-time scenarios revealed that the uncertainty for the efﬁcacy of the transformation processes for pig bristles is very much dependent on the time of application. Longer times would result in the reduction of theuncertainty on the ef ﬁcacy of the process.8) Horns, horn products, hooves and hoof products: – It was judged 66 –95% certain that the transformation process, as de ﬁned in the legislation (80 °C for 60 min), is able to reduce, to the required extent, the indicator bacteria ( E.faecalis and S.Senftenberg), the most resistant of the three indicator microorganisms and biological hazards ( E.faecalis ,S.Senftenberg and Picornaviridae ).7.Recommendations The data available on the intrinsic physicochemical properties (e.g.pH, aw) of most of the ABP under assessment, and on the occurrence of biological hazards in them, are very scarce.It isrecommended to implement studies to ﬁll these knowledge gaps.
Data available in the literature on thermal and non-thermal (chemical) inactivation of indicator microorganisms and biological hazards are mainly derived from studies carried out in basicbroth-based laboratory models or food systems. It is recommended to undertake studies onthe survival of biological hazards in ABP matrices, and if possible, in full-scale systems, tosupport future risk assessments.It is recommended to conduct a full characterisation of the usage pathways of ABP as OF/SI inthe EU, to facilitate the development of future risk assessments.The current opinion focusses on the question of whether the log 10reductions of indicator microorganisms and biological hazards, as given in the legislation, are achieved.The impact of these log 10reductions and the uncertainty on actual animal/public health risks has not been quanti ﬁed.
As a follow-up, it is recommended that a risk assessment of the usage of ABP is considered, as this would provide insight into the consequences of deviations from thereductions that the processes should achieve. In the statement of purpose of such a riskassessment, the precise usage of the ABP should be clearly de ﬁned.References Abu-Orf MM, Brewster J, Oleszkiewicz J, Reimers RS, Lagasse P , Amy B and Glindemann D, 2004.Production of class A biosolids with anoxic low dose alkaline treatment and odor management.Water Science and Technology, 49, 131 –138.https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2004.0626 Abutarbush SM, Hananeh WM, Ramadan W, Al Sheyab OM, Alnajjar AR, Al Zoubi IG, Knowles NJ, Bachanek- Bankowska K and Tuppurainen ESM, 2016.Adverse reactions to ﬁeld vaccination against lumpy skin disease in jordan.Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, 63, e213 –e219.https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.12257 Aguirre J, Pin C, Rodriguez M and Garcia de Fernando G, 2009.

The EKE question was speci ﬁed as follows: ‘What is the probability that a Xlog10reduction of the Yindicator is achieved in more than 99% of the cases, by application of the process as indicated in the table, to the material(s) as indicated in the table, assuming that the process is performed as prescribed and that the indicated process conditions are achieved? ’.Ycould be S.Senftenberg (775W, H 2S negative), E.faecalis , the most resistant of the viruses (as per hazard identi ﬁcation or parvovirus if none was identi ﬁed) or eggs of Ascaris sp.Xis 5 for S.Senftenberg (775W, H 2S negative) and E.faecalis, or 3 for the most resistant of the viruses (as per hazard identi ﬁcation or parvovirus if none was identi ﬁed) or eggs of Ascaris sp.It is assumed that the standard process is correctly performed, under the conditions indicated by the process parameters, and as described in the opinion.Variability in process performance is not to be considered in this assessment.
However, even without any variation in process performance, the log reduction achieved may vary to some extent from case to case. The question to answer is whether thetarget log 10reduction will be achieved in more than 99% of cases, because 100% may be too unrealistic and would become dependent on ‘exceptional cases ’.Thus, the ‘probability ’in the question refers to uncertainty, not variability.Speci ﬁcally, it expresses the degree of certainty that the target log10reduction will be achieved in more than 99% of the cases.The EKE consisted of two steps: – Step 1: individual judgements (14 July to 16 August 2021) – Step 2: consensus judgements (20 August 2021) The experts comprised six Working Group (WG) members developing the opinion (one extra WG member resigned before Step 2 and did not provide individual judgement), plus two EFSA scientists who were supporting the WG.The elicitation was facilitated by an elicitor (hearing expert).
A member of the EFSA scienti ﬁc staff was appointed as rapporteur. The EKE section was recorded, only as a support to prepare the notes.This recording has been removed to assure anonymity of the experts.Step 1: Individual judgements Training was delivered to all participants on the general concept of probability, EFSA ’s approximate probability scale, uncertainty, variability and EKE.During Step 1, the participants had nearly 5 weeks to provide individual judgements for each of the 52 combinations by considering them separately, taking into account the version of the draft opinion atthe beginning of the process (14 July 2021) with the raw data on thermal and chemical inactivation ofthe indicators, the description of the processes, the integration of the evidence and the uncertaintytable, as well as the personal expertise and assessment of the uncertainties involved.For this purpose,the experts received a spreadsheet with a template to provide their answers.
They did not discusstheir judgements with other experts at this stage. The answer for each combination was given as a probability range that re ﬂects the expert ’s degree of certainty that the indicated log 10reduction is achieved.These probability ranges could be one of those given in the approximate probability scale presented in EFSA ’s uncertainty guidance or any other.The participants were encouraged to give explanations of the reasons for each subjective probabilityrange.
The options included the template were: 99–100% (almost certain) 95–99% (extremely likely) 90–95% (very likely) 66–90% (likely) 33–66% (about as likely as not) 10–33% (unlikely)Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 105 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 5–10% (very unlikely) 1–5% (extremely unlikely) 0–1% (almost impossible) 100% (certain) 50–100% (more likely than not) 0–50% (more unlikely than likely) 0–100% (inconclusive) Other (to be de ﬁned by the participant) Step 2: Consensus judgements The next step was to reach a consensus judgement for each of the 52 data points. During the open session in the WG meeting, for each combination of materials and processes (16), three or four probabilities were discussed at a time depending on the number of indicators.
It was explained that the consensus is not an average of the individual judgements, or a compromise where some expertsdefer to the judgement of other participants. The experts were asked to consider what a rationalimpartial observer (RIO) would judge, having considered the evidence, uncertainties, the individualjudgements and having heard the discussion.After getting an overview of the individual expert judgements obtained in step 1, at the beginning of the EKE session, the participants expressed the rationale behind their individual judgements, toclarify potential generic biases in their judgements.As proposed by the team preparing the EKE, the elicitor and a WG member, the discussion started for each combination with the standard subjective probability ranges associated with the mean of themedian estimates of all the individual ranges as a proposed consensus, avoiding the discussion ofindividual opinions per se.
During the discussion, there was a focus on the evidence as presented inthe opinion and consistency in the probability ranges obtained for the different combinations. The stepwise approach applied for each of the combinations consisted of the following actions: Recall material/process description and target log 10reduction.Show summary sheet and proposed consensus.Display graphs showing expert ranges.Invite responses to the proposed consensus ranges for the indicators –are they what an RIO would think?Review individual judgements for selected indicators if helpful.Discuss proposed adjustments to consensus (if any).Conﬁrm consensus –if not reached, invite experts to review/revise own judgements and submit them after the meeting.Check that the notes taken have captured the key reasons for the consensus judgements.Results of Step 1: Individual judgements Individual judgements were obtained from eight experts.The results are illustrated in Figures C.1 andC.2.
The ﬁgures show that there is large agreement between individual experts for some of the combinations, and large disagreement for others. These results were discussed during Step 2 of the EKE.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 106 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Combinations are indicated as material number .Process number .Indicator (s:S.senftenberg; e: E.faecalis; a: eggs of Ascaris sp; v: virus).The bars indicate the whole range of elicited probabilities (lowest lower value of the ranges to highest upper value of the ranges) and the range of the medians of the ranges provided by the experts.The dots show the mean of the median estimates provided by the experts.

Easier for thermal treatments while more uncertain for chemical treatments Judgement started by indicator and used the evidence from the opinion, supported bybackground knowledge and giving priority to some papers. Judgement based on evidence in the opinion.Judgement based on quantitative data in the ﬁgures of the opinion for bacteria and tables for viruses.Less con ﬁdent on chemical processes.Results of the consensus for each combination After discussion among the experts, consensus was achieved on the probability ranges that were considered to best represent the uncertainty on whether the indicated log reductions are achieved withthe standard processes for the different materials.Consensus implied that the experts agreed that an RIO, considering the evidence and following the discussion, would conclude that the elicited probability range was appropriate.Table C.1provides the main arguments for obtaining these ranges, for each of the 16 processes.
The red bars indicate the range of the mean of the lowest estimates of the ranges provided by the expert to the mean of the upper estimates of these ranges (M) and the whole range of elicited probabilities (WR).

1.1 Ash derived from incineration 850°C,>2sAlthough the temperature of the process (850 °C) is extremely high and the three indicators would be reduced to the desired level, there is some uncertainty left considering that the duration of 2 seconds may not be sufﬁcient, the starting concentration is unknown and there may be some protecting material. 1.2 Ash derived from incineration 1,100 °C,>0.2 sThe temperature of the process (1,100 °C) is higher than in 1.2 but with shorter time (0.2 s) and it is believed that the three indicators would bereduced to the desired level.Still, the starting concentration is unknown and there may be some protecting material leaving some uncertainty.
2.1 Glycerine derived from the production of biodiesel andrenewable fuels Category 2 materials 133°C, 20 min, 3 bar (Method 1) +pH <1/72 °C/>2 h (esteri ﬁcation) + pH~14/35 °Ct o5 0 °C/>15 min (transesteri ﬁcation)The thermal treatment (133 °C, 20 min, 3 bar) alone would give signi ﬁcant reductions of the three indicators as inactivation of non-spore forming bacteria at temperatures >100°C should be achieved in a few seconds. There is a sequence of this thermal with chemical treatments (esteri ﬁcation and transesteri ﬁcation) that is expected to give further reductions.There is some uncertainty left as the material is pure fat in which it is more dif ﬁcult to reduce the three indicators.2.2 Glycerine derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuelsCategory 3 materials 80°C, 120 min (Method 5 (a)) + pH~14/35 °Ct o5 0 °C/>15 min (transesteri ﬁcation)As in 2.1, it needs to be considered that the material is pure fat.The probability ranges of E.
faecalis and S.Senftenberg are considered the same. The range is quite broad re ﬂecting the uncertainty on whether there is a difference or not; In case there was a difference, there would be a bit lower con ﬁdence for S.Senftenberg than for E.faecalis .The probability for the Parvovirus is lower compared to the bacterial indicators as the thermal treatment may be effective but there is noclear indication on the effect of the pH on the virus inactivation during the transesteri ﬁcation step.2.3 Glycerine derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels Category 3 materials100°C 60 min (Method 5(b)) + pH~14/35 °Ct o5 0 °C/>15 min (transesteri ﬁcation)The rationale is the same as in 2.2.The probability range has been increased compared to 2.2 for the bacterial indicators and the Parvovirus because of the higher temperature used in this process for which there is more evidence of inactivation.
3.1 Other products of materials derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuelsCategory 2 materialsMethod 1: 133 °C, 20 min, 3 barThis is the same process as in 2.1 but without transesteri ﬁcation and with a different material (but with high fat content). There is some evidence that the treatment would be less effective on S.Senftenberg compared to E.faecalis .However, this difference is not big enough to have a different probability range (i.e.E.faecalis a bit higher and S.Senftenberg a bit lower).For the Parvovirus, the range was considered the same as for the bacteria considering the evidence onthermal inactivation.3.2 Other products of materials derived from the production ofbiodiesel and renewable fuelsCategory 3 materials Method 5(a): 80 °C, 120 minThe process is the same as in 3.1, but with lower temperature and higher time.It is also the same process as in 2.2 but withouttransesteri ﬁcation and with a different material (but with high fat content).
The evidence on thermal inactivation indicates that the thermal treatment is not suf ﬁcient to inactivate S.Senftenberg. Compared to 3.1, the difference between S.Senftenberg and E.faecalis is more obvious as there is a larger range here.For the Parvovirus there is more uncertainty here based on the available evidence on thermal inactivation.3.3 Other products of materials derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuelsCategory 3 materials Method 5(b): 100 °C, 60 minThe rationale is the same as in 3.2.The lower bound of the probability range has been increased compared to 3.2 for the bacteria and the Parvovirus because of the higher temperature used in this process in which there is more evidence for inactivation.
The difference between the bacterial indicators is again more obvious as the range is larger.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 109 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Process Summary of rationale as recorded by the rapporteur. 4.1 Hides and skins Limed hides pH 12 –13, 8 hThere is less evidence about the inactivation for this process and there is uncertainty about the level of heat released through the liming process which is dependent on the lime concentration used (concentration or temperature are not mentioned in legislation).The desired reductionmay not be achieved using the pH alone also considering that the matrixhas a very low water content.For Ascaris the time needed for inactivation (as in studies) is much longer.For the viruses (Papillomavirus, Picornavirus, Reovirus ), the reduction is more dif ﬁcult to achieve compared to bacterial indicators, but easier compared to Ascaris .
4.2 Hides and skins pH~12,>8h+pH<3, 16 hCompared to 4.1, the matrix is the same, but a treatment has been added (pH <3 16 h) and the alkaline treatment lasts longer. The upper bound has been increased for the bacteria considering the acid treatment.There is little information on the inactivation of Ascaris eggs at acidic pH which may add an additional reduction.For the viruses, there is less information available than for bacterial indicators but there is some evidence for reductions at acidic pH values.5.1 Wool and hair pH>12–13, 5 minThere are no data available for such short alkaline processes which may be too short to achieve the desired level of reduction.The temperature will not rise because the processing time is short.Ascaris eggs are likely more dif ﬁcult to reduce by alkaline processes than the bacterial indicators and viruses.5.2 Wool and hair pH>12–13, 60 minAs the treatment time is longer compared to 5.1, both the lower and upper ranges have been increased.6.
Feather and down 100°C for at least 30 minThe treatment is made with steam and after washing, which would increase the water content of the matrix. The temperature/time combination would be suf ﬁcient to inactivate the bacterial indicators.For the viruses ( Anellovirus, Circovirus), there is higher uncertainty than for bacteria.7.1 Pig bristles 100°C in water, 5 minThe treatment is made with boiling water, which would increase the water content of the matrix.The time is shorter compared to 6, and both the lower and upper ranges have been decreased.For parvoviruses, contradictory data are available around 100 °C.7.2 Pig bristles 100°C in water, 60 minThe treatment is at the same temperature as 7.1 but for longer time and therefore the lower and upper ranges have been increased.8.Horns, horn products, hooves and hoof products80°C1hThe material is rich in protein and with a very low-fat content and lower water activity than other materials, which led to an increase of theuncertainty.
Picornaviridae are less resistant than Parvoviridae and the evidence mainly supports that the desired reduction would be achieved.Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 110 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932 Annex A –Protocol Annex A can be found in the online version of this output ( ‘Supporting information ’section): https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2021.6932#efs2(Rev)6932-sup-0001Inactivation of indicator microorganisms in animal by-products to be used as organic fertilisers www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 111 EFSA Journal 2021;19(12):6932
