Elucidation of an anaerobic pathway for metabolism of L-carnitine –derived γ-butyrobetaine to trimethylamine in human gut bacteria Lauren J.Rajakovicha, Beverly Fua, Maud Bollenbacha, and Emily P.Balskusa,1 aDepartment of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138 Edited by Caroline S.Harwood, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, and approved June 22, 2021 (received for review February 18, 2021) Trimethylamine (TMA) is an important gut microbial metabolite strongly associated with human disease.There are prominent gapsin our understanding of how TMA is produced from the essential dietary nutrient L-carnitine, particularly in the anoxic environment of the human gut where oxygen-dependent L-carnitine –metabolizing enzymes are likely inactive.Here, we elucidate the chemical and ge-netic basis for anaerobic TMA generation from the L-carnitine –derived metabolite γ-butyrobetaine ( γbb) by the human gut bacterium Emergencia timonensis .
We identify a set of genes up-regulated byγbb and demonstrate that the enzymes encoded by the induced γbb utilization ( bbu) gene cluster convert γbb to TMA. The key TMA- generating step is catalyzed by a previously unknown type of TMA-lyase enzyme that utilizes a putative flavin cofactor to catalyze aredox-neutral transformation.We identify additional cultured and uncultured host-associated bacteria that possess the bbu gene clus- ter, providing insights into the distribution of anaerobic γbb metab- olism.Lastly, we present genetic, transcriptional, and metabolomicevidence that confirms the relevance of this metabolic pathway in the human gut microbiota.These analyses indicate that the anaer- obic pathway is a more substantial contributor to TMA generationfrom L-carnitine in the human gut than the previously proposed aerobic pathway.
The discovery and characterization of the bbu pathway provides the critical missing link in anaerobic metabolismof L-carnitine to TMA, enabling investigation into the connection between this microbial function and human disease. microbiota |trimethylamine |L-carnitine The human gut microbiota collectively synthesizes an array of small molecule metabolites.The metabolic output of this mi- crobial community varies substantially between individual human subjects, and specific metabolites are strongly associated with health and disease (1 –3 ) .I nm a n yc a s e s ,h o w e v e r ,w el a c kb o t ha molecular understanding of how gut microbial metabolites influ-ence human physiology and how the metabolites themselves are produced.
These gaps in knowledge limit our ability to establish causative effects of microbial metabolites in human disease and todevelop microbiota-based strategies to improve human health.Identification of the specific organisms, genes, and enzymes re- sponsible for metabolite production is needed to accurately profile specific metabolic functions in microbial communities, to experi-mentally investigate links to disease, and to modulate the meta- bolic output of the gut microbiota. Trimethylamine (TMA) is a gut microbial metabolite that has been strongly associated with human disease.It is derived from gutmicrobial transformations of dietary nutrients including phos- phatidylcholine, choline, L-carnitine, betaine, and TMA N-oxide (TMAO) (4 –9).Microbially produced TMA is absorbed by the host in the gastrointestinal tract, enters hepatic circulation, and is oxidized to TMAO in the liver by the flavin-dependent mono- oxygenase FMO3 (10).
Genetic mutations in the human FMO3 gene lead to accumulation of TMA in the body, causing themetabolic disorder trimethylaminuria or fish malodor syndrome (11). In addition, elevated plasma levels of TMA and TMAO havebeen associated with multiple human diseases, including cardio- vascular, chronic kidney, and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases,obesity, type II diabetes, and colorectal cancer (12).Especiallystrong correlations between TMAO and its precursors have beendemonstrated for cardiovascular disease (CVD).Elevated plasma levels of dietary TMA precursors were also associated with disease risk, but only when they co-occurred with elevated TMAO levels(6, 7, 9).Furthermore, oral administration of the TMA precursorsphosphatidylcholine, choline, and carnitine to atherosclerosis-prone mice resulted in development of atherosclerotic plaques ina gut microbiota-dependent fashion (6, 7).
Direct oral adminis-tration of TMAO in these mice similarly resulted in phenotypes of atherosclerosis (6). These observations suggest a causal role for TMAO in animal models of CVD and that gut microbial metabo-lism is a crucial factor contributi ng to pathogenesis.However, a causative role of TMA or TMAO in the development or exacer-bation of complex diseases has not yet been definitively establishedin humans.Deciphering the contribution of TMA production tohuman disease clearly necessitates a better understanding of the gut microbial metabolic pathways that generate this small molecule.L-Carnitine is an important dietary precursor to TMA, and its metabolism by gut microbes is associated with CVD (13).An es-sential nutrient for the host, L-carnitine plays a key role in fatty acid β-oxidation by transporting fatty acids across the mito- chondrial membrane for metabolism (5, 14).
Although it is pro-duced endogenously, humans must uptake additional L-carnitine Significance Trimethylamine (TMA) is a disease-associated metabolite pro- duced in the human body exclusively by microbes. Gut microbesgenerate TMA from essential nutrients consumed in the humandiet, including L-carnitine.However, our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms involved in these transformations is incomplete.In this work, we define the biochemical pathwayand genetic components in gut bacteria required for anaerobicproduction of TMA from γ-butyrobetaine, a metabolite derived from L-carnitine.This discovery identifies a new type of TMA- producing enzyme and fills a critical gap in our knowledge of L-carnitine metabolism to TMA in the anaerobic environment of the human gut.This knowledge will enable evaluation of the link between L-carnitine metabolism and human disease and the design of potential therapeutics.Author contributions: L.J.R.and E.P.B.designed research; L.J.R.

The most well-known conversion of L-carnitine involves the pro- duction of TMA; however, the human gut bacterium Eubacterium limosum was also recently reported to demethylate L-carnitine (18). Studies in rats and human subjects demonstrated that a large pro-portion of dietary L-carnitine is converted to TMA and that this metabolism is dependent on the gut microbiota (7, 19, 20).In ad-dition, these studies noted accumulation of an intermediate me-tabolite identified as γ-butyrobetaine ( γbb) that was produced by the gut microbiota (19 –21).Furthermore, γb bw a ss h o w nt ob ea proatherogenic metabolite in mouse models like its precursor L-carnitine (21).The well-charac terized metabolic pathway that converts L-carnitine to γbb is encoded by the caigene operon (Fig.1) and is used during anaerobic respiration by facultative an-aerobic Proteobacteria such as Escherichia coli ,Salmonella typhi- murium ,a n d Proteus mirabilis (5).
The microbial genes and enzymes that are responsible for generating TMA from L-carnitine –derived γbb, however, are not fully elucidated. Specifically, there is a significant gap in our understanding of the molecular basis for TMA production from L-carnitine and γbb precursors under anaerobic conditions.Select facultative anaerobic Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria possess an iron-dependent Rieske-type monooxygenase (CntA) that can di-rectly convert L-carnitine to TMA (21 –23).This enzyme uses dioxygen to hydroxylate L-carnitine at the C4 position, followed by nonenzymatic formation of an aldehyde through eliminationof TMA (Fig.1).Whereas L-carnitine was the only substrate tested for activity with CntA from Acinetobacter baumannii (22), theE.coli homolog, also known as YeaW (71% amino acid identity), was shown to produce low levels of TMA from both L-carnitine and γbb (21).
Although CntA activity was originally proposed to represent the major mechanism for conversion of L-carnitine to TMA by the human gut microbiota, this conclusionhas been called into question. This enzyme strictly requires dioxygen for catalysis; however, dioxygen levels in the colon lumen are<1 mm Hg (24).In addition, a study in humans showed that plasma TMAO levels after a carnitine challenge were not corre-lated with cntA gene abundance in gut microbiomes (25).Notably, TMA production from L-carnitine and γbb was demonstrated in anaerobic ex vivo incubations of mice cecal and colon tissues (21).Finally, the human gut isolate Emergencia timonensis ,a no b l i g a t e anaerobe that does not encode a CntA homolog, was recentlyfound to metabolize γbb to TMA under strictly anaerobic growth conditions (13).Collectively, this information indicates the exis- tence of an as-yet-uncharacterized anaerobic pathway for γbb metabolism in the human gut microbiota.
We present here the identification and characterization of the metabolic pathway, genes, and enzymes responsible for anaerobicTMA production from γbb in E. timonensis .The enzyme catalyzing the key C –N bond cleavage reaction that generates TMA is a flavin-dependent, acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase-like en- zyme that uses the activated CoA thioester of γbb as its substrate.This chemically challenging react ion generates the intermediate crotonyl-CoA, which is further metabolized by E.timonensis for anaerobic respiration and as a s ource of carbon and energy.Ho- mologous gene clusters for γbb metabolism are present in other cultured and uncultured host-as sociated bacteria from the Clos- tridiales order.We find that anaerobic γbb metabolism is prevalent in human gut microbiomes and is likely a major underappreciated contributor of L-carnitine –derived TMA.
Together, this work ex- pands our knowledge of TMA-producing enzymes, pathways, and organisms, providing a more complete understanding of microbial TMA production in the anoxic human gut. These findings identifypotential targets for manipulation of this microbial function andwill help resolve the major dietary and microbial contributors to TMA production.Results γbb Induces Expression of a Candidate Gene Cluster in E.timonensis SN18.Only a single cultured bacterium, a human fecal isolate of E.timonensis , has been reported to produce TMA from γbb under anaerobic conditions (13).We began our efforts to identify thegenes and enzymes responsible for γbb metabolism by testing the type strain E.timonensis SN18 for this activity.Indeed, anaerobic cultures of E.timonensis SN18 supplemented with γbb demon- strated complete consumption of this substrate and production of astoichiometric amount of TMA ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 ).
When the cultures were supplemented with [ N-(CD 3)3]-γbb, deuterium- labeled TMA was detected by liquid chromatography –tandem mass spectrometry (LC –MS/MS) ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 ), confirm- ing its origin from γbb. Resting cell suspensions of E.timonensis SN18 also fully converted γbb to TMA (Fig.2 A).However, this activity was only observed when the cells had been cultured inmedium containing γbb; resting cell suspensions of E.timonensis SN18 cultured in the absence of γbb were unable to consume γbb and did not generate TMA (Fig.2 A).Together, these results suggest that γbb induces expression of the genes involved in its metabolism.We also evaluated the ability of E.timonensis SN18 to metab- olize DL-carnitine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), close struc- tural homologs of γbb.Neither of these substrates was consumed during growth ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 ) nor in resting cell suspensions of cultures supplemented with γbb (SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 ).
Next, we tested whether these substrate analogs could induce expression oftheγbb metabolic enzymes. Resting cell suspensions of cultures supplemented with GABA did not exhibit γbb metabolism; how- ever, resting cell suspensions from cultures supplemented with DL- carnitine did convert γbb to TMA (Fig.2 A).Thus, while DL-car- nitine appears to induce expression of the genes responsible for γbb metabolism in E.timonensis , the metabolic enzymes are unable to use DL-carnitine as a substrate for TMA generation.N OO OH N OO N OO R NHOHCntAB (YeaWX)CaiABCD-carnitine /g74-butyrobetaine TMAnon- enzymaticgenes / enzymes unknownR = H, OHCntAB (YeaWX) NO TMAOdisease- associated metaboliteshost FMO3AEROBIC O2 O2dietary nutrientANAEROBIC Fig.1.Anaerobic and aerobic bacterial metabolic pathways producing TMA from L-carnitine.2o f1 1 |PNAS Rajakovich et al.
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101498118 Elucidation of an anaerobic pathway for metabolism of L-carnitine –derived γ-butyrobetaine to trimethylamine in human gut bacteria The inducible metabolism of γbb in E. timonensis SN18 sug- gested that the genes involved in this pathway could be discov-ered using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq).Only two sets of genes were both highly and differentially expressed in γbb-induced cultures compared to control cultures grown in the absence ofγbb (Fig.2 BandDataset S1 ).As expected from our previous cell-based activity experiments, expression of these genes wasalso up-regulated in cells grown with DL-carnitine, but not with GABA ( SI Appendix , Fig.S2 andDataset S1 ).The most differ- entially up-regulated genes are colocalized in the E.timonensis SN18 genome within a region we designate the γbbutilization (bbu) gene cluster (Fig.2 C).
This six-gene cluster encodes a pre- dicted flavin-dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( bbuA ), two class III CoA transferases ( bbuB andbbuC ), a di-[4Fe-4S]-cluster ferredoxin ( bbuD ), a betaine/carnitine/choline transporter ( bbuE ), and an acyl-CoA thioesterase ( bbuF ). The second set of genes up- regulated in γbb-induced cells encodes for predicted riboflavin biosynthesis enzymes ( Dataset S1 ), which likely support cofactor biosynthesis for the enzyme encoded by bbuA .The highly specific transcriptional response to γbb suggested that the bbugene cluster was involved in γbb metabolism.In addition, the presence of a gene encoding a transporter for trimethylammonium-containing compounds ( bbuE ) was consistent with this hypothesis.The CoA Transferases BbuB/C Initiate γbb Metabolism via Formation of a γbb-CoA Thioester.
Based on the predicted annotations of the bbugenes, we hypothesized that γbb would be initially activated for subsequent TMA elimination through formation of a CoA thioester. The conversion of a carboxylic acid to a thioester is acommon first step in many metabolic pathways as it lowers the p K a of the C α-protons, facilitating further reactions (26, 27).Indeed, in resting cell suspensions incubated with γbb, a metabolite was de- tected by liquid chromatography –mass spectrometry (LC –MS) with a peak retention time and mass-to-charge ratio (895.5 m/z, [M+H]+) matching those of a γbb-CoA standard (Fig.3 AandSI Appendix ,F i g .S 3 ).The origin of this metabolite was confirmed by incubating cell suspensions with deuterium-labeled 2,2,3,3,4,4-D 6- γbb (D 6-γbb), which led to an increase of 6 Da (901.5 m/z,[M+H]+) for the assigned γbb-CoA peak (Fig.3 Aand SI Ap- pendix ,F i g .S 3 ).These results support the hypothesis that γbb metabolism proceeds via a CoA thioester intermediate.
We next investigated whether two CoA transferases encoded by the bbugene cluster, BbuB and BbuC, are directly involved in γbb-CoA production. These proteins both belong to the class III CoA transferase family but only share 30% amino acid sequence identity with one another.Indeed, γbb-CoA was detected from incubations of γbb with crude lysate of E.coli cells constitutively expressing the first three genes of the cluster ( bbuABC )( F i g .3 B).Interestingly, γbb-CoA was not detected when either of the two CoA transferase genes was expressed alone (Fig.3 B).Production ofγbb-CoA was also observed when recombinant, purified BbuB and BbuC were added together with γbb to lysate of E.coli transformed with empty vector ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 3 ) but, again, only when both proteins were present.The requirement for both CoA transferase proteins was also confirmed in vitro.
In these experiments, the BbuB and BbuC proteins together generated γbb-CoA from γbb and an appropriate acyl-CoA donor substrate (Fig. 3 C,SI Appendix ,F i g .S 3 ).Based on these biochemical activity results, we proposed that the BbuB and BbuC form a functional hetero-oligomeric com-plex.To test our hypothesis, we conducted a pull-down affinity chromatography experiment using C-terminal streptavidin-tagged BbuB (BbuB-Strep) and N-terminal six histidine-tagged BbuC(BbuC-His).Lysates from separate heterologous expressions of each protein in E.coli were combined and loaded onto Ni 2+-NTA resin to bind the BbuC-His protein, after which the resin waswashed with buffers containing increasing concentrations of imid- azole.We predicted that if the BbuB and BbuC proteins form a stable complex, high concentrations of imidazole would be requiredto displace the BbuB-Strep protein along with the BbuC-His protein.

PNAS |3o f1 1 Elucidation of an anaerobic pathway for metabolism of L-carnitine –derived γ-butyrobetaine to trimethylamine in human gut bacteriahttps://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101498118 BIOCHEMISTRY antibody demonstrated that the BbuB-Strep protein was present in fractions eluted with high concentrations (250 mM) of imidazole ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 4 ). In contrast, control experiments without the BbuC-His protein showed BbuB-Strep protein only in the initialwash fractions with low concentrations (25 mM) of imidazole ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 4 ).These results provide i nitial evidence that BbuB and BbuC form a stable hetero-oligomeric complex, although thenature of the complex (e.g., stoichiometry, catalytic roles of eachmonomer) remains to be determined.We next sought to determine the substrate specificity of the BbuB/C enzyme reaction.Various short-chain fatty acyl-CoAs(acetyl-, butyryl-, propionyl-, and crotonyl-CoA) were tested asCoA-donating substrates.
While all compounds resulted in pro-duction of γbb-CoA, acetyl-CoA was the preferred cosubstrate ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 3 ). This preference for acetyl-CoA in vitro, how- ever, does not preclude the use of an alternative donor in vivodepending on availability or requirements for energy conservation(e.g., CoA recycling via butyryl-CoA).We also tested DL-carnitine and GABA as alternative CoA acceptors in vitro with BbuB/C andacetyl-CoA as the donor.However, neither of the presumedproducts, carnitinyl-CoA or γ-aminobutyryl-CoA, was detected by LC–MS/MS under the reaction conditions tested ( SI Appendix , Fig.S3 ).The high selectivity of the CoA transferases BbuB and BbuC for γbb directly connects the bbu gene cluster to γbb metabolism.The Flavoenzyme BbuA Catalyzes Elimination of TMA from γbb-CoA.The key step in TMA production from γbb is breaking an unactivated C –N bond.
None of the bbugenes is predicted to encode homologs of known enzymes that catalyze C –N bond cleavage and release TMA [e.g., choline TMA-lyase (28), glycinebetaine reductase (29), ergothionase (30)], indicating that thispathway uses a distinct enzyme for this critical step. We identi-fied the predicted acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-like enzyme BbuA asthe most likely candidate for this reaction.Enzymes belonging tothe acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family are flavin-dependent oxi-doreductases that act on acyl-CoA thioester substrates, typicallyinstalling or removing an α,β-unsaturation through two-electron oxidation or reduction reactions, respectively (31).We envi-sioned that BbuA might instead use a flavin cofactor in a crypticradical mechanism to activate γbb-CoA for TMA elimination from the C4 position.
This proposed re action resembles the C4 elimi- nation of water from 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA catalyzed by the flavinadenine dinucleotide (FAD)-depe ndent enzyme 4-hydroxybutyryl- CoA dehydratase (4HBD) involved in bacterial GABA and suc-cinate metabolism (32). While Bb uA and 4HBD are predicted to have a similar structure and harbor a flavin cofactor, they sharevery minimal sequence identity ( ∼10%).Initial attempts to access soluble BbuA protein via heterologous expression in E.coli were unsuccessful.Soluble BbuA protein was only obtained under the following conditions: 1) coexpression withthe native GroEL-ES proteins from E.timonensis SN18, 2) addi- tion of exogenous riboflavin to the growth medium, and 3) addi-tion of excess FAD during cell lysis.Crude lysates of E.coli cells overexpressing the bbuABC genes under these conditions dem- onstrated TMA production when incubated anaerobically withγbb and acetyl-CoA ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 5 ).
Purified BbuA con- taining oxidized FAD was then tested for activity in vitro whenincubated with γbb, acetyl-CoA, and the CoA transferases BbuBC. Robust TMA production was observed after a 1-h incubationwithout addition of redox mediators (Fig.4 B), demonstrating that these reaction components are sufficient to catalyze multipleturnovers of γbb.To probe whether the FAD cofactor is essential for BbuA activity, chemically reduced protein was tested for TMAproduction, as complete exclusion of FAD from the proteinpreparation led to protein insolubility.When BbuA was reducedwith excess sodium dithionite, TMA production was severely di-minished ( SI Appendix , Fig.S5 ), suggesting that the FAD cofactoris required for activity and serves a redox role in the reaction.Finally, γbb-CoA was tested directly as the substrate for BbuA in vitro.This reaction also resulted in TMA production (Fig.4 C), demonstrating that BbuA alone is sufficient to catalyze TMAelimination in vitro.
These results demonstrate that BbuA is the critical TMA-generating enzyme in O 2-independent γbb metabo- lism by E. timonensis .Next, we sought to determine the coproduct of the BbuA- catalyzed reaction.We predicted that crotonyl-CoA would begenerated upon elimination of TMA from γbb-CoA by analogy to 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydration in GABA/succinate metabo-lism (32).Indeed, crotonyl-CoA was detected by LC –MS/MS in both the E.coli crude lysate incubations ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 5 )a n d the in vitro assays with purified BbuA (Fig.4).Both the retention time and m/zof the detected metabolite were consistent with a crotonyl-CoA standard ( SI Appendix , Fig.S5 ).The production of crotonyl-CoA supports the proposed redox-neutral TMA elimi-nation from γbb-CoA (Fig.4).Together, the gain-of-function ex- periments in E.
coli and in vitro activity assays demonstrate that thebbugene cluster is responsible for TMA production from γbb and that the three genes bbuABC are necessary and sufficient to confer this function in E. coli and in vitro.E.timonensis Metabolizes γbb for Anaerobic Respiration and Carbon Acquisition.Although crotonyl-CoA was produced in lysate and in vitro reactions containing BbuA, crotonyl-CoA did not accu-mulate in resting cell suspensions of E.timonensis SN18 incubated with γbb.Instead, we detected the known products of bacterial crotonyl-CoA metabolism: 3-hydrox ybutyryl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and butyryl-CoA (Fig.5 B).Inspection of their mass spectra showed deuterium incorporation when D 6-γbb was used, confirming their origin from γbb (SI Appendix ,F i g .S 6 ).

In both cases, crotonyl-CoA was converted to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA during an hour incubation ( SI Appendix ,F i g . S7).Longer incubations led to accu mulation of acetyl-CoA and low levels of butyryl-CoA ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 7 ).However, these down- stream conversions in the assay we re likely limited by the cofactor concentrations present in the lysate and thus do not represent thenative partition of the end-products from crotonyl-CoA metabolism.These results demonstrate that the final steps of γbb metabolism in E.timonensis SN18 are known transformations of crotonyl-CoA, cata- lyzed by constitutively produced enzymes encoded outside of the bbu gene cluster (Fig.5 A).Some species of Clostridia can use crotonyl-CoA metabolism for anaerobic respiration via reduction to butyryl-CoA and as acarbon and energy source through conversion to acetyl-CoA(Fig.5 A)( 3 4 ,3 5 ) .W ee x a m i n e dw h e t h e r γbb metabolism via crotonyl-CoA would enhance the growth of E.

In both culture conditions, the growth yield was markedlyenhanced with γbb supplementation (Fig.5 Cand D)a n dt h e growth rate was consistent with the rates of γbb depletion and TMA production ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 8 ).These results support a key role for crotonyl-CoA as an intermediate in γbb metabolism and indicate a physiological role for this activity in E.timonensis .Due to the prominent role of butyrate in the human gut, we next investigated whether free butyrate was produced from E.timonensis γbb metabolism.Using a carboxylate-derivatization method and LC –MS, elevated levels of butyrate were detectedin suspensions of γbb-induced cells incubated with γbb compared to suspensions of noninduced cells (Fig.5 EandSI Appendix , Fig.S9).In addition, deuterium incorporation into butyrate was ob- served when D 6-γbb was used (Fig.5 F).
Analysis of the mass spectrum revealed that the D 6-isotopolog was not present; rather the +4 Da species was the primary isotopolog detected (Fig. 5 F andSI Appendix , Fig.S9 ).The loss of two deuteria in the buty- rate product is consistent with a crotonyl-CoA precursor.To ruleout the possibility that the loss of label resulted from exchange of the acidic C α-deuterons with protons from solution, a control experiment was performed incubating perdeuterated D 7-buty- rate with cell suspensions.The mass spectrum of butyrate from this experiment showed minimal deuterium exchange with sol- vent protons during the same incubation period ( SI Appendix , Fig.S9 ).In addition, γbb-CoA detected from incubations with D6-γbb showed minimal deuterium loss ( SI Appendix , Fig.S9 ).These control reactions support the proposal that γbb metabo- lism in E.timonensis proceeds through the α,β-unsaturated crotonyl-CoA intermediate and generates free butyrate in resting cell suspensions.
To further investigate whether butyrate was the major end-product of γbb metabolism in actively growing E. timonensis , we quantified derivatized butyrate by LC –MS from cultures grown with D 6-γbb in rich medium and the two types of minimal media described above.Deuterium-labeled butyrateaccounted for only 8.5% of the to tal butyrate produced in rich media but up to 34% and 40% of t he total butyrate produced in minimal media with limited electron acceptors and carbon sources,respectively.However, in each medium, the deuterium-labeled butyrate only amounted to ∼5% of the original γbb, indicating that butyrate is not the major final product of this metabolism andthus is not likely to contribute substantially to overall levels of butyrate produced in the gut.Thebbu Gene Cluster Predicts γbb Metabolism in Bacterial Isolates.As noted previously, E.timonesis is the only bacterial species known to metabolize γbb to TMA under anaerobic conditions.

PNAS |5o f1 1 Elucidation of an anaerobic pathway for metabolism of L-carnitine –derived γ-butyrobetaine to trimethylamine in human gut bacteriahttps://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101498118 BIOCHEMISTRY discovered the gene cluster responsible for this activity, we searched for homologous gene clusters in other sequenced bac- terial genomes. We identified bbu-like gene clusters in four host- associated, cultured bacteria belonging to the order Clostridiales.To examine whether the bbugenes are diagnostic of γbb metab- olism, two commercially available strains, the human oral isolate Eubacterium minutum American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 700079 and the feline gut isolate Agathobaculum desmolans ATCC 43058 (previously Eubacterium desmolans orButyricoccus desmo- lans), were tested for this activity.Both strains converted γbb to TMA in anaerobic cultures (Fig.6 A), demonstrating that the presence of the bbugene cluster predicts the capacity for anaerobic γbb metabolism.
The rarity of this gene cluster in sequenced ge- nomes of cultured bacteria motivated us to search uncultured bacterial genomes that had been assembled from human meta- genomes (i.e., metagenome-assembled genomes [MAGs]) (36, 37). We identified homologous bbu gene clusters in 11 uncultured, human-associated MAGs, all of which belong to the order Clos- tridiales (Fig.6 BandDataset S3 ).Two of the uncultured bacterial genomes were assembled from human oral samples, while the remaining genomes harboring the bbugene cluster were assembled from human stool samples.The presence of the bbugene cluster in multiple uncultured gut bacteria suggests that γbb metabolism is underrepresented among cultured isolates and that E.timonensis may not be solely responsible for this metabolism in the human gut.Finally, we searched for the presence of the caigenes responsible for metabolizing L-carnitine to γbb in these bbu-containing bacterial genomes.
However, none of these genomes possess homologs of known caigenes, indicating that these γbb-metabolizing bacteria are incapable of the full conversion of L-carnitine to TMA. Presence of bbu Genes in Human Gut Metagenomes Is Correlated with Lower γbb Levels.Motivated by the presence of the bbu gene cluster in uncultured gut bacteria and the implications for γbb metabolism in human health, we assessed the prevalence of thebbugene cluster in publicly available human metagenomic datasets.Our analysis used the bbuA gene as a representative of the full cluster in stool metagenomes from healthy adult pop- ulations.We detected hits for the bbuA gene in samples fromevery cohort, but the proportion of bbuA -positive samples varied substantially between cohorts, ranging from 15% to 85% positive(Fig.7 A).
We also quantified the abundance of the bbuA gene in bbuA -positive samples and found that it was consistent across cohorts at 1:1,000 genes per microbial genome, with a range of1:10 2to 1:104genes per microbial genome ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 0 ). Since diet has been reported as an important factor in TMAproduction capacity of the microbiota, we examined whether bbuA gene presence or abundance was correlated with diet.However,neither bbuA gene presence nor abundance was correlated with self-reported omnivorous or vegetarian donors from the BIO-MLcohort ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 1 ).Overall, the distribution profile of bbugenes suggests that γbb-metabolizing bacteria are frequently present in the human gut microbiota but are low-abundance members of the community.To provide further support for the relevance of the bbupathway in the human gut, we evaluated gene expression using metatran-scriptomic data from three cohorts: HMP2 (38), iHMP (39), andMLVS (40).
We detected bbuA transcripts in 27% to 56% of samples in these cohorts (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that the bbupath- way is expressed in the human gut.Transcripts of the bbuA gene were detected in the same samples that were positive for the bbuA gene but also in a subset (16% to 26%) of bbuA -negative samples (SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 2 ).This observation suggests that the bbuA gene abundance was too low to be detected by the metagenomicsequencing but that the transcript levels were high enough to becaptured by the read depth of the metatranscriptomic sequencing.Notably, very few samples in these cohorts (0% to 4%) werepositive for cntA transcripts (Fig.7 BandSI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 2 ), consistent with previously reported analyses (41).Thus, the met-atranscriptomic data suggest that the bbupathway is more likely to be functionally operant in the human gut than the O 2-dependent pathway mediated by cntA.
Next, we examined three cohorts with corresponding stool metabolomics data [HMP2 (38), BIO-ML (42), and PRISM (43)]to evaluate whether the presence of bbuA gene or transcripts is associated with changes in metabolite levels. In each of the threeindependent cohorts, the levels of γbb were lower in samples that were positive for the bbuA gene compared to those that were 0.06 MAG-LoomMAG-Beng MAG-LiuW6 MAG-LiuW27MAG-Niel MAG-GUT31863 MAG-GUT72726 Epulopiscium sp.Nuni2H_MBin003MAG-GUT11352 Emergencia timonensis SN18MAG-GUT16382Intestinibacillus sp.Marseille-P6563 Intestinibacillus sp.Marseille-P4005 MAG-GUT11285Agathobaculum desmolans ATCC 43058 Eubacteriaceae bacteriumEubacterium minutum ATCC 700079 MAG-CMperi3 1.0 0.90 - 0.991 kbAB 00.20.40.60.81 abiotic A.desmolansabiotic E.minutummetabolite (mM)γbb TMA Fig.6.Cultured and uncultured host-associated Clostridiales bacteria possess bbu-like gene clusters indicative of γbb metabolism.

The bbuA gene, however, was not associated with stool carnitine or butyrate levels ( SI Ap- pendix ,F i g .S 1 5 ). In contrast, the presence of the cntA gene was correlated with higher or equivalent γbb levels, rather than lower, when compared to cntA-negative samples (Fig.6 CandSI Appendix , Fig.S13 ).These results suggest that the bbugene cluster may be primarily responsible for γbb consumption in the human gut.Finally, we evaluated whether differences in the presence or abundance of the bbuA gene are correlated with human disease.Although TMA production is not known to be a factor in in-flammatory bowel disease (IBD), we noticed that the bbuA gene was detected in fewer samples from donors with Crohn ’s disease and ulcerative colitis compared to healthy controls in bothHMP2 (38) and PRISM (43) cohorts (Fig.7 DandSI Appendix , Fig.S16 ).The same trend was observed when analyzing bbuA transcripts in the HMP2 study (Fig.7 D).
However, there was no difference in gene abundance between the IBD and healthycohorts ( SI Appendix , Fig. S16 ).Next, we analyzed metagenomes of a CVD cohort from China (44).The proportion of bbuA - positive samples was not different between healthy and CVDgroups (Fig.7 E), but the gene abundance in bbuA -positive sam- ples was modestly higher in CVD donors compared to healthy controls (Fig.7 F).A more significant elevation was found in the caiA gene abundance in the CVD cohort compared to the healthy group (Fig.7 F), suggesting that the conversion of L-carnitine to γbb may be a more relevant biomarker for CVD than the bbugene cluster.Consistent with previous reports (41), we also detected ahigher prevalence and abundance of the cntA gene in CVD samples compared with healthy controls from this study (Fig.7 E and F).However, the lack of correlation between cntA gene presence and expression observed in other cohorts raises questionsabout the functional relevance of this finding.
Discussion Gut microbial production of TMA from dietary L-carnitine has been recognized for decades, but our knowledge of the reactions,enzymes, and organisms involved in the O 2-independent pathway has remained incomplete. We used RNA-seq to identify a substrate-inducible bbugene cluster that is responsible for anaerobic γbb metabolism in the gut microbe E.timonensis .We demonstrated that the enzymes encoded within the bbugene cluster are necessary and sufficient to convert γbb to TMA in vitro and for gain-of-function in E.coli .With the discovery of the genetic basis for anaerobic γbb metabolism, we then determined the chemical steps involved,identified other gut microbes with this function, and evaluated therelevance of this microbial activity in human populations.
The pathway for anaerobic metabolism of γbb provides an in- teresting parallel to GABA metabolism by gut microbes (45).Given the structural similarity of the two molecules, which differby only the N-methylation of γbb, the use of comparable pathways for their catabolism is perhaps not surprising. Analogous chemicalsteps, including substrate activation via CoA formation and C4elimination, occur in both pathways to yield the common productcrotonyl-CoA.This intermediate is then processed by the bacteriaas a carbon and energy source or as an electron acceptor.
Yetthere are notable distinctions in the substrate activation steps and510710910/g74bb (ion counts)p = 7.6 × 10-8p = 5.2 × 10-6Fraction365 563 112 300 913 471 1135 187 185 bbuA (+) caiA (+)genes / microbial genome genes / microbial genome genes / microbial genome cntA (+)p = 0.040 p = 5.1 × 10-5p = 3.6 × 10-7bbuA cntA 0.00.20.40.60.81.0 0.00.20.40.60.81.0metagenomics bbuA (+) gene bbuA (+) transcript H CD UCFraction Fraction CVD365154 598347 375220 187 218 healthyCVDpositive negativeA C DF-210 -310 -410-210 -310-110010 -210010 -410 HB 0.00.20.40.60.81.0 HMP2 iHMP MLVS378 762 78Fraction bbuA (+)cntA (+)0.00.20.40.60.81.096 50metatranscriptomics metabolomics bbuA (+) EbbuA (+) cntA (+) Fig. 7.Anaerobic γbb metabolism genes are widely distributed and expressed in the human gut microbiota.( A) Fraction of stool metagenomes that are positive (red) and negative (gray) for the bbuA gene from healthy donors in human studies ( Dataset S4 ).Study sample size ( N) is indicated above each bar.

Rajakovich et al.PNAS |7o f1 1 Elucidation of an anaerobic pathway for metabolism of L-carnitine –derived γ-butyrobetaine to trimethylamine in human gut bacteriahttps://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101498118 BIOCHEMISTRY key lyase enzymes of each pathway.Conversion of the carboxylate to the thioester lowers the p Kaof the C α-protons (26, 27), facili- tating elimination of the C4 hydroxyl or trimethylammonium group in the 4HBD- or BbuA-catalyzed reaction, respectively.Due to itspositive charge, the trimethylammonium moiety of γbb-CoA is a good leaving group for C4 elimination.At physiological pH, the primary amine of GABA would also be protonated and positively charged (46), which could enable an analogous direct eliminationfrom a hypothetical γ-aminobutyryl-CoA intermediate.
Interest- ingly, GABA-metabolizing bacteria instead convert the amine into a hydroxyl group, which is a worse leaving group, prior to forma- tion of the CoA thioester and C4 elimination. This biochemicalpathway may be the result of repurposing the 4HBD enzyme from succinate metabolism in bacteria and archaea (47 –49), which pro- ceeds via a 4-hydroxybutyryl-C oA intermediate.The flavin- dependent lyase enzymes, 4HBD and BbuA, that catalyze the keyC4 elimination step in these pathways both belong to the broad structural superfamily of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (31).This ge- neric functional annotation implies two-electron redox chemistryusing a flavin cofactor.However, 4 HBD diverges from this canonical function and instead is proposed t o use a radical-based mechanism (50) wherein the flavin cofactor performs single-electron chemistry to mediate water elimination.
BbuA could use a similar mechanistic strategy for TMA elimination; however, these two proteins havenegligible ( <10%) sequence identity to one another. Thus, it remains an open question as to whether they use distinct mechanisms to catalyze seemingly analogous, chemically challenging C4-eliminationreactions.The mechanism of the T MA-lyase reaction catalyzed by BbuA will be the subject of future studies.Our current understanding of BbuA reveals that it is unique compared to the other known T MA-producing enzymes.The L-carnitine monooxygenase CntA u ses a metallocofactor to activate dioxygen for substrate hydroxylation, generating a chemically un- stable product that breaks down to eliminate TMA.Conversely,BbuA directly catalyzes the C –N bond cleavage step.The enzyme glycine betaine reductase catalyzes an overall two-electron reduction of glycine betaine to produce TMA, employing protein-substrate covalent adducts via (seleno)cysteine residues (29).
In contrast,BbuA catalyzes a redox-neutral transformation and requires anoxidized flavin cofactor. The choline TMA-lyase CutC is a glycyl radical enzyme which uses protein-based radicals to initiate ca- talysis (28).CutC is proposed to generate a carbon-centeredsubstrate radical intermediate that undergoes a spin center shiftand promotes direct 1,2-elimination of TMA (51).The BbuA enzyme could share a similar radical-based mechanistic logic with CutC but, instead of protein-based radicals, may use a flavin co-factor for radical generation.However, the chemical differences between the γbb and choline substrates —the aliphatic carbon chain attached to the trimethylammonium in γbb compared to the vicinal hydroxyl group in choline that actively participates in TMAelimination —will necessitate mechanistic divergence.
Intriguingly, the mechanism employed by CutC could theoretically operate using L-carnitine as the substrate, as it also has a vicinal alcohol, yet such a hypothetical reaction is not known to exist. Anaerobic γbb metabolism is a microbial function found in only a select group of human gut bacteria.Prior to this work, E.timonensis was the only organism known to perform this trans- formation and, correspondingly, was found in high abundance inhigh-TMAO producers from a human carnitine-challenge study (52).However, E.timonensis was only detected in 25% of indi- viduals from that group (52), suggesting that additional gutbacteria possess this metabolic activity.Indeed, we have discov- ered that the bbugene cluster is present in other related gut bacteria.The bbugene cluster was found exclusively in obligate anaerobic bacteria of the Clostridiales order, but it is not ubiq-uitous within this taxonomic group.
This observation contrasts with choline metabolism, which is widely distributed across dif- ferent gut microbial phyla and classes (53). In addition, the bbugene cluster is only found in host-associated bacteria.While most bbu-encoding bacteria were isolated from human stool, a few bacteria originated from the human oral cavity.Bacteria that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of other animals (i.e., cat andfish) were also found to possess bbugene clusters, suggesting a broader range of hosts.Anaerobic TMA production from γbb has not been reported outside of host-associated contexts, con- sistent with our finding that the bbugene cluster is not found in environmental bacteria.Thus, a select group of anaerobic gutbacteria appear to possess a specialized metabolism that sup- ports their growth in this niche.Our discovery of the genetic basis for γbb metabolism confirms the proposal that the anaerobic conversion of L-carnitine to TMA is an interspecies metabolic pathway.
Our analyses show that bacteria possessing the bbupathway to produce TMA from γbb do not have the caioperon required to convert L-carnitine to γbb and vice versa. This observation could explain why γbb-metabolizers inhabit host environments where L-carnitine is abundant due to dietary consumption and where other bacteria can convert it toγbb.The inability of γbb-metabolizing bacteria to generate γbb from L-carnitine highlights the importance of cross-feeding in the gut microbiota.There are now many examples of microbial cometabolism in the gut (54), including polysaccharide utilization(55), lignin degradation (56), and even drug metabolism (57).Since TMA can only be produced anaerobically when both L-carnitine and γbb utilizing organisms are present, an investiga- tion into their co-occurrence will be important to deconvolute thecontribution of anaerobic L-carnitine metabolism to TMA gener- ation in the human gut.
Our initial bioinformatic analyses indicate that the bbupathway producing TMA is likely functionally important in the human gut.Using the bbuA gene as a marker for anaerobic γbb metabolism, we find that this activity is widely distributed in human stool metagenomes. We also detect bbuA transcripts in human stool sequencing data, demonstrating that these genes are expressed inthe gut environment.Furthermore, the presence of the bbuA gene and transcripts is correlated with lower levels of γbb in stool, suggestive of active γbb consumption in subjects possessing this gut bacterial pathway.Conversely, the cntA gene is not correlated with changes in stool metabolite levels, nor is it highly expressed in the human gut.This lack of expression could perhaps indicate dioxygen-dependent regulation of cntA.
Intriguingly, 79% of the HMP2 samples (30/38) that were positive for cntA transcripts were from donors with IBD, suggesting that factors associated with inflammation, such as increased O 2levels, may induce expression ofcntA. An independent study also concluded that the cntA gene is not expressed in healthy human gut microbiomes (41).Our analysis replicates their reported results using two of the same cohorts (MLVS and iHMP) and adds the larger HMP2 cohortthat was since published.Together, our bioinformatic analysesusing the bbuA gene as a marker for the later steps in anaerobic L-carnitine metabolism suggest that the O 2-independent pathway, rather than the O 2-dependent pathway, is more relevant for TMA production from L-carnitine in the anoxic gut environment.This conclusion advises caution when inferring functional relevance from gene presence alone and highlights the importance of con- sidering how environmental factors can influence microbialmetabolic functions.
Our evaluation of anaerobic γbb metabolism in the human gut microbiota suggests that this pathway may be associated with disease states. In IBD cohorts, the lower prevalence of the bbuA gene and transcripts could reflect a decrease in O 2-intolerant bacteria, such as bbu-encoding Clostridiales, due to elevated O 2 levels caused by inflammation.This trend has been noted for other microbial functions that are restricted to obligate anaerobes, forexample, metabolism of cholesterol to coprostanol by uncultured Clostridia (58).Although TMA production has not been linked to IBD pathology, this observation demonstrates how environmental 8o f1 1 |PNAS Rajakovich et al.https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101498118 Elucidation of an anaerobic pathway for metabolism of L-carnitine –derived γ-butyrobetaine to trimethylamine in human gut bacteria conditions can influence metabolic functions.
On the other hand, the strong connection between TMA production from L-carnitine and CVD motivated our targeted analysis of γbb metabolism in this disease. We did not find a significant difference in the prev- alence of bbugenes in CVD donors compared to healthy controls, but we did observe that the abundance of bbuandcaigenes was elevated in CVD donors.However, our analysis of paired meta-genomic and metatranscriptomic datasets (not associated withCVD) highlights challenges in drawing conclusions from meta-genomic data alone.We found that the presence or absence of thebbugenes in metagenomic data does not always reflect the pres- ence or absence of bbu-encoding organisms.For example, samples that are negative for bbugenes can be positive for bbutranscripts, suggesting that the bbu-expressing organisms are present but perhaps in too low of an abundance to be detected by the meta-genomic sequencing read depth.
Furthermore, we experimentallydemonstrate that expression of the bbugene cluster is regulated by γbb and L-carnitine in E. timonensis .These results together indi- cate that transcriptomics is a better reporter of metabolic function, particularly for low-abundance members of the microbiota like γbb-metabolizing bacteria.A more comprehensive evaluation of the contribution of an- aerobic γbb metabolism to overall TMA levels in human pop- ulations should integrate diet ary information and host serum metabolites with multi-omic ana lyses.Dietary studies have dem- onstrated a greater capacity for the gut microbiota from omnivo- rous donors to produce TMA from L-carnitine compared to vegans or vegetarians (7, 13, 25, 52).Our analysis of the bbuA gene in self- reported dietary groups did not rev eal differences in prevalence or abundance.However, a more thorough analysis of co-occurrenceof L-carnitine and γbb metabolism in controlled dietary cohorts may reveal differences.
Diet may also be a complicating factor toconsider in meta-analyses of disease cohorts. Finally, although our results show that the bbuA gene and transcripts are correlated with lower γbb levels, implying increased production of TMA from this substrate, we were unable to evaluate TMA and TMAO levelsfrom stool metabolomics in these human populations because theyare most reliably detected in serum, plasma, or urine.Demon-strating this correlation will be important to conclusively link an-aerobic metabolism of L-carnitine –derived γbb to elevated systemic levels of TMA(O) in healthy and disease populations.Our dis- coveries set the groundwork for subsequent analyses to address this connection.This work highlights the importance of enzyme discovery for understanding the chemical basis of gut microbial metabolite pro-duction, connecting metabolic acti vities with specific microbes, and analyzing gut microbial functions in human populations.
We haveuncovered a distinct enzymatic strategy to generate TMA from γbb in an O 2-independent manner. The BbuA enzyme acts in a pathway that leads to the production of metabolites that are independentlyassociated with human disease and health.We have discovered anadditional important group of TM A-producing bacteria in the hu- man gut microbiota.The identification of the bbugene cluster in many uncultured bacteria highlights this portion of the microbiotaas a rich source of underappreciated chemistry that can have im- portant roles in human health.Finally, the identification and characterization of the bbupathway fills an important gap in our knowledge of TMA production from L-carnitine in the anoxic hu- man gut.With a more complete understanding of the metabolicnetwork involved in TMA production, we can begin to dissect thedietary, microbial, and metabolic factors that lead to its generation and connection to human disease.

Sample preparation and analytical methods for detection and quantification of γbb,γbb analogs, TMA, butyrate, and CoA-thioester compounds are described in detail in the SI Appendix .Bioinformatic Analyses.Genome searches.TheE.timonensis BbuA protein sequence was used in a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search of the National Center for Bio-technology Information nonredundant protein database, the UniProt data-base (release 2019_07), and the Joint Genome Institute-Integrated MicrobialGenomes database of all isolates.Hits with >70% amino acid sequence iden- tity were considered BbuA homologs.Searches were also conducted of the HMP1 reference genomes and genomes from the human gut bacteria culture collections described in Dataset S3 .No additional hits were identified from these searches.Next, collections of human MAGs ( Dataset S3 )w e r ep e r f o r m e d using a tblastn search and an e-value cutoff of <0.0001.
Hits were manually evaluated and further filtered using a >70% amino acid sequence identity cutoff. Contigs containing hits were annotated using the Galaxy webtool Prokka (62, 63).Phylogenetics.A multiple sequence alignment was generated using MAFFT v7.455 (64) of the BbuA homolog protein sequences and 2,388 representa-tives of protein clusters with >80% amino acid sequence identity from the top 10,000 hits of a BLAST search of the UniProt database (release 2019_07)using the E.timonensis SN18 BbuA protein as a query.A maximum- likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using IQ-TREE v1.6.12 (65) with the LG+F0+G12 model and visualized using FigTree v1.4.4 (66).Branchsupports were calculated using the aBayes method (67).Metagenome and metatranscriptome searches and quantification.BbuA homolog protein sequences ( Dataset S6 ) were used to generate a protein database.
A negative control protein database was made using protein sequences acquiredfrom the following steps: 1) the top 10,000 results were obtained from a BLAST search of the UniProt database (release 2019_07) using E. timonensis SN18 BbuA as the query, excluding BbuA homologs described; 2) these sequenceswere clustered using UniRef50 (release 2019_07), resulting in 288 representativeproteins; and 3) each unique sequence from step 1 between 50% and 70%sequence identity to E.timonensis SN18 BbuA was added to the list from step 2.The CntA protein database consisted of E.coli YeaW (UniProt P0ABR8), A.baumannii CntA (UniProt D0C9N6), and Klebsiella pneumoniae CntA (UniProt A0A377WGT7).Human studies reporting the stool meta ’omic data that were analyzed in this work are listed in Dataset S4 .
A blastx DIAMOND (68) search with an e-value cutoff of <0.0001 and a percent amino acid sequence identity of >50% was performed using the raw shotgun metagenome or metatranscriptomesequencing reads against the BbuA, CntA, and negative control databases. If the highest sequence identity hit for the read to a BbuA protein was greater than or equal to that of a negative control protein and the sequence identityto the BbuA protein was >70%, then that read was considered a positive hit for a bbuA gene or transcript.The positive hits for each metagenome sample were summed and then normalized by RPKM and average genome size (AGS) using the following equations: RPKM =(reads total reads)/106 gene length [kb] Abundance =RPKM ×AGS ×10−9.Average genome size for each sample was calculated using MicrobeCensus (69).Plots and statistical analyses were performed using the ggplot2 pack-age v3.3.2 (70) and R v3.6.0 (71).Data Availability.
