Ten baselinebiomarkers were included: Hb, measured with both a hematology analyzer and a HemoCue; inflammation-adjustedferritin; soluble transferrin receptor; reticulocyte Hb; hepcidin; mean corpuscular volume; inflammation-adjusted totalbody iron stores (TBIS); total iron binding capacity; and transferrin saturation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)curves from fitted logistic regression models were used to make discrimination comparisons and variable selectionmethods were used to construct a multibiomarker prognostic model.Results: Only 25% ( n=95/383) of women who completed the trial experienced a 12-week Hb response ≥10 g/L.
The strongest univariate predictors of a Hb response were Hb as measured with a hematology analyzer, inflammation- adjusted ferritin, hepcidin, and inflammation-adjusted TBIS (AUC ROC=0.81, 0.83, 0.82, and 0.82, respectively), and the optimalcutoffstoidentifywomenwhowerelikelytoexperienceaHbresponsewere117g/L,17.3 μg/L,1.98nmol/L,and 1.95 mg/kg, respectively. Hb as measured with a hematology analyzer, inflammation-adjusted ferritin, and hepcidin hadthe best combined predictive ability (AUC ROC=0.86).Hb measured with the HemoCue had poor discrimination ability (AUCROC=0.65).Conclusions: Baseline Hb as measured with a hematology analyzer was as strong a predictor of Hb response to iron supplementation as inflammation-adjusted ferritin, hepcidin, and inflammation-adjusted TBIS.This is positive giventhat the WHO currently uses the population-level anemia prevalence to guide recommendations for untargeted ironsupplementation.J Nutr2021;151:2255–2263.

Although population-level anemia prevalence is used to guide recommendations for untargeted iron supplementation,Hb concentration is generally considered to be a poor prognostic indicator of iron status ( 1). This is because the causes of anemia are multifactorial and can include factorsrelatedtonutritionalstatus(e.g.,micronutrientdeficiencies)( 5), inflammationorinfection(e.g.,parasitesormalaria)( 6),aswell as genetic Hb disorders (e.g., sickle cell or thalassemia) ( 7).Other iron biomarkers may have greater diagnostic sensitivity to determine iron status and to determine whether a woman wouldbenefitfromironsupplementation.Commonbiomarkers of iron status include ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), ( 8) and total body iron stores (TBIS) ( 9).Other hematological biomarkers that can help to diagnose anemia and measure iron status include reticulocyte Hb, hepcidin, transferrin saturation, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), andmean corpuscular volume (MCV).
Each of these biomarkers have both strengths and limitations in their measurement and interpretation ( 10). Measurement of the Hb response to iron supplementation is an alternative method to estimate the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia and can help to estimate the proportion of anemic women who are responsive to ironsupplementation ( 11).In Cambodia, anemia prevalence is high ( ∼60%) but the causes of anemia are multifactorial and include iron orother micronutrient deficiencies, infection, and disease (e.g., hookworm) ( 6,12), as well as genetic Hb disorders (e.g., Hb E variants and thalassemia) ( 7).If iron deficiency is not the predominant cause of anemia in this population, untargeted iron supplementation may be a waste of resources and, at worst,may even cause harm.Iron is a catalyst of oxidative andinflammatoryreactions( 13,14).Excessironcancauseoxidative stress (15) and DNA and cellular damage ( 16–18).
Excess unabsorbed iron in the colon can also promote the growth ofpathogens while inhibiting the growth of commensal bacteria (14,19). Against this background, the best practice would be to avoid blanket supplementation and only supplementthose women who would benefit from iron and elicit a Hb response to iron supplementation.To inform this, we need to understand which biomarkers would be most useful tomeasure,in order to predict who would most benefit from iron supplementation.Our aim was to evaluate ten hematological biomarkers in Cambodian women and determine, using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which baseline biomarker orcombination of biomarkers best predicts a Hb response to 12 weeks of daily oral iron supplementation.The trial was funded by the Micronutrient Initiative, Sight and Life Foundation, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).

Women were eligible to participate if they were healthy, nonpregnant, aged 18–45 years,andhad aHbconcentration ≤117 g/Lat the timeof screening based on a nonfasting finger-prick capillary blood sample measuredon a HemoCue Hb 301 portable device (HemoCue AB).
A cutoffof 117 g/L, rather than the WHO-recommended 120 g/L cutoff foranemia ( 1), was used to recruit women who were more likely to experience a Hb response ≥10 g/L. Women were excluded if they were taking any dietary and food supplements or medication.A total of809 women were enrolled and received one of four daily treatmentsfor 12 weeks: 60 mg elemental iron as ferrous sulfate ( n=201); 14 other micronutrients, not including iron ( n=202); iron and 14 other micronutrients ( n=206); or placebo capsules ( n=200).To assess the predictors of a 12-week Hb response to iron supplementation,analyses were restricted to only the women receiving iron-containingsupplements (total n=407).The 2 ×2 factorial analysis revealed that there was no significant effect of multiple micronutrients on the Hbconcentration at 12 weeks ( 20); thus, women receiving iron with or without other micronutrients were treated as similar for the current analysis.
Laboratory analyses Women that met screening (Hb ≤117 g/L) and other eligibility criteria were enrolled. A fasting venous blood sample was collected in themorning at baseline and after 12 weeks of supplementation and wasprocessed within 2–4 hours.A complete blood count was performedusing an automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex XN-1000; SysmexCorp.) to measure whole blood Hb (g/L), reticulocyte Hb (g/L), and MCV(fL).SerumwasassessedwithuseofasandwichELISAforferritin (μg/L),sTfR(mg/L), α1-acidglycoprotein(AGP;g/L),C-reactiveprotein (CRP; mg/L), and TBIS (mg/kg) ( 21).Serum ferritin concentrations and TBIS calculations were adjusted for levels of inflammation basedon AGP and CRP concentrations, as per global recommendations ( 22, 23).
Determinations of serum total iron and unbound iron binding capacity (UIBC) were achieved using commercial IRON2 and UIBCreagent kits in conjunction with an auto chemistry analyzer (HitachiRocheCobasC311;RocheDiagnosticsCorp.);fromtheseresults,TIBCand transferrin saturation (%) values were calculated. Serum hepcidin(nmol/L)wasmeasuredusingaHepcidin-25Bioactiveimmunoassaykit(DRG International Inc.).Data and statistical analyses The primary outcome for this analysis was Hb response, a binaryvariable based on a ≥10 g/L increase in the Hb concentration for the period of iron supplementation from baseline to 12 weeks.An increaseof 10 g/L was selected as a Hb response that would indicate irondeficiency anemia ( 24,25).
Baseline Hb (as measured by both a HemoCue and a Sysmex automated hematology analyzer),inflammation-adjusted ferritin,sTfR,reticulocyte Hb content, hepcidin, MCV, inflammation-adjusted TBIS,TIBC, and transferrin saturation were assessed for their predictivepowersona12-weekHbresponsetoironsupplementation.Preliminarybaseline comparisons between Hb nonresponders and responders weremade using nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuousvariables (skewed) and chi-square tests for categorical variables. ROCcurves were then used to assess the discrimination performance ofeach biomarker through fitted logistic regression models to the primaryoutcome of Hb response.In this analysis, we first assessed the use of univariate variables (single hematological biomarkers) to predict a Hb response.
Forthese biomarkers, an “optimal” threshold (optimal cutoff value)was obtained that maximizes the sum of sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) as a measure of the 2256 Pei et al. threshold value with the best diagnostic ability ( 26).Multivariate logistic regression models were then explored to assess the combinedpredictability of more than one hematological biomarker on the Hbresponse.For each ROC curve, the associated binary classifier system is the univariate (or multivariate) logistic regression model betweenthe corresponding biomarker(s) and Hb response (yes/no).We alsomeasured the area under the ROC curve (AUC ROC) as a measure of the ability of the model to discriminate between individuals at high orlowriskofaHbresponse.Generally,anAUC ROCvaluegreaterthan0.8 denotes a good classifier ( 27).
Model selection was performed using both an “all-subsets ap- proach”(which fits all possible models based on the independent vari- ables specified) and backwards elimination to obtain a multibiomarkerprognostic model that maximally predicts the Hb response ( 28). Both the significance of variables and model fit statistics were considered inthe process of selection.Akaike information criterion (AIC) was chosenas the model fit statistic,balancing a good model fit with the number ofpredictors, penalizing additional parameters, and minimizing the riskof overfitting ( 29).In addition to the main effects, interaction terms between iron status indicators were also evaluated in the prognosticmodel.Further assessments of the predictive ability of the multivariatemodel were performed through cross-validation techniques.
The dataset was divided into training and validation sets using 50:50, 70:30,and 80:20 splits, with the aim of testing the prognostic model on datanot originally used to build the model. This allowed for an unbiasedestimation of model reliability and assessed for potential issues ofoverfitting or selection bias ( 30,31).Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.3 (R Core Team 2020) and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Inc).Results Detailed demographic characteristics of enrolled women have been published elsewhere ( 20).In summary,women included in this analysis were from Kampong Chhnang province ( n=407) and had a mean ±SD age of 30 ±8 years.In our cohort, 68% (n=275/407)ofwomenweremarried,55%( n=224/407)had completed at least primary school,and 38% ( n=153/407) had 1 or 2 children.Overall,383ofthe407enrolledwomen(94%)whoreceived iron completed the trial and had data available for this analysis(Figure 1 ).
A total of 24 women had missing endline Hb measurements;thus,Hbresponsescouldnotbeassessedinthese individuals. At baseline, 407/407 (100%) were anemic basedonHemoCuemeasurements(duringscreening),245/407(60%) were anemic based on the Sysmex automated hematology analyzer, and 87/406 (21%) were iron deficient based oninflammation-adjusted ferritin concentrations <15μg/L.Of the women with samples available for baseline and endline Hb for the current secondary data analysis, 232/383 (61%)were anemic at baseline based on the Sysmex automated hematology analyzer and 85/383 (22%) were iron deficient at baselinebasedoninflammation-adjustedferritinconcentrations <15μg/L.We used the portable HemoCue device for screening purposes in the field; however,we ap r i o r ichose the automated hematology analyzer to be the gold standard measurement for Hb in our study.Of note, we did not measure Hb withuse of the HemoCue at 12 weeks.
We included baseline Hb measurementswithuseofbothofthesemethodsinthisstudyas univariate predictors of a Hb response. Our primary outcomeof Hb responsewas based on thechange in Hb from baselineto 12 weeks, measured with the automated hematology analyzer.We report Hb concentrations in this manuscript and indicatethe measurement device in parentheses: Hb (HemoCue) or Hb (Analyzer).The mean change in Hb (Analyzer) from baseline to 12 weeks was 6.3 ±13.2 g/L; overall, at 12 weeks only 25% ( n=95/383) of women had a Hb response ≥10 g/L.
The proportion of women with a Hb response substantially increased when only considering women who were anemic atbaseline [37% (Analyzer); n=85/232] and iron deficient at baseline(67%; n=57/85).Significantdifferenceswereobserved in hematological biomarker concentrations (Wilcoxon ranksum tests) and in anemia and iron deficiency prevalence rates (chi-square tests) between Hb responders and nonresponders (Table 1; test statistics are reported with Pvalues <0.05 in- dicative of statistical significance). ROC curve analysis IndividualROCcurvesforthebaselinehematologicalbiomark- ers are displayed in Figure 2.Among the ten baseline hemato- logical biomarkers assessed, four were found to have AUC ROC values greater than 0.8: Hb (Analyzer; 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76– 0.86), inflammation-adjusted ferritin (0.83; 95% CI, 0.77– 0.88), hepcidin (0.82; 95% CI, 0.77–0.88), and inflammation-adjusted TBIS (0.82; 95% CI, 0.76–0.88).
We also explored whether the selection of a lower threshold to define a Hb response (5 g/L compared with 10 g/L) resultedin a change in discrimination ability (AUC ROC)f o rt h et e n hematological biomarkers. Based on this threshold of 5 g/L, 207/383 women (54%) were deemed as nonresponders and176/383 (46%) were deemed as responders.We found that the discrimination ability (AUC ROCvalue) decreased for all ten of thehematologicalbiomarkersafterloweringthethresholdfrom10 g/L to 5 g/L.A discrimination threshold analysis was performed on the four baseline hematological biomarkers with the strongest pre-dictive power for a Hb response: Hb (Analyzer),inflammation- adjusted ferritin, hepcidin, and inflammation-adjusted TBIS.Optimal thresholds for these four biomarkers, based onmaximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity, as well as the associated sensitivity and specificity values of these thresholds, are listed in Table 2.
Multibiomarker prognostic model Among the ten baseline hematological biomarkers measured,five were selected for further assessment of their combinedpredictive power on a 12-week Hb response in our multivari- ate prognostic model: Hb (Analyzer), inflammation-adjusted ferritin, sTfR, hepcidin, and transferrin saturation. As TIBCis calculated with the use of transferrin saturation, we chose to only include transferrin saturation in multivariate models.Multicollinearity was assessed using variance inflation factor(VIF), a measure of the inflation of variances of the parameter estimates as a result of correlated predictors ( 32).VIF values greater than 5 have been shown to impact the reliability of results (32).MCV (VIF =6.65), reticulocyte Hb (VIF =9.54), and inflammation-adjusted TBIS (VIF =11.69) were excluded from the multivariate model due to issues of multicollinearity.
Further, Hb (HemoCue), TIBC, MCV, and reticulocyte Hb had low discrimination ability on their own (univariate analysesinFigure 1 ), justifying their appropriate exclusion from the multivariate model. A multivariate model including main effects of Hb (An- alyzer), inflammation-adjusted ferritin, and hepcidin, as well as the interaction term between inflammation-adjusted ferritin and hepcidin, was selected as the final multivariate model Predictors of a hemoglobin response to iron 2257 FIGURE 1 Flow diagram of trial participants included in this secondary data analysis.The Fe group received 60 mg iron daily; the Fe +MMN groupreceived60mgironand14othermultiplemicronutrientsdaily;andtheMMNgroupreceived14othermultiplemicronutrientsdaily.MMN,multiple micronutrients.(AIC =294.64; AUCROC=0.86; 95% CI, 0.81–0.90).
Per- forming a likelihood ratio test revealed a marginally bettermodel in terms of goodness of fit ( P=0.084) compared to the bivariate model of Hb (Analyzer) and inflammation-adjusted ferritin selected through variable selection methods alone. The regression summary of the final multivariate prognostic model is presented in Table 3.Hb (Analyzer) and inflammation- adjusted ferritin (AIC =295.59; AUC ROC=0.85; 95% CI, 0.80–0.90) were selected with use of both all-subsets and backwards elimination methods based on AIC values andsignificance (using a significance threshold of P<0.05).Asall of the hematological biomarkers are involved in the iron metabolism pathway and serve as indicators of anemia or ironstatus, pairwise interactions between the biomarkers were also examined in the multivariate model.All interaction terms were insignificant except for the interaction between hepcidin andinflammation-adjusted ferritin.
Thus, hepcidin was included in the multivariate model based on the significant interaction effect. Comparisons between the multivariate prognostic model and univariate models with each biomarker alone revealed significantly better predictive and diagnostic ability of the 2258 Pei et al.

Likelihood ratio tests with univariate models of Hb (Analyzer; AIC =338.42; AUCROC=0.81; 95% CI, 0.76–0.86), inflammation-adjusted ferritin (AIC =357.02; AUCROC=0.83; 95% CI, 0.77–0.88), and hepcidin (AIC =370.46; AUCROC=0.82; 95% CI, 0.77–0.88) revealed unanimous significant results ( P<0.0001) in favor of the multivariate model. AUC comparisons between single- biomarkermodelsofHb(Analyzer)andinflammation-adjustedferritin and the multibiomarker model revealed significant results ( P=0.022 and P=0.018, respectively) in favor of the multibiomarker model.A similar comparison betweenthe univariate model of hepcidin and the final proposed multivariate model revealed a marginally significant result (P=0.058).The multivariate prognostic regression summary suggests that lower Hb,lower inflammation-adjusted ferritin,and lower hepcidinatbaselineareallassociatedwithincreasedlikelihoodsof experiencing a Hb response to iron supplementation.
Interestingly, the relationship between inflammation-adjusted ferritin, hepcidin, and the Hb response does not appear tobe simply linear additive. The individual negative associations of inflammation-adjusted ferritin and hepcidin with the Hb response are modified by a positive effect of their joint interaction term.Although the magnitude of the coefficient of thisinteractiontermappearssmall,thecorrespondingpredictoris the multiplied value of inflammation-adjusted ferritin and hepcidin, thereby magnifying the scale.
Cross-validation of the multivariate predictive model using training and validation set splits of 50:50, 70:30, and 80:20 revealed insignificant AUC ROCcomparisons [ P=0.371, P=0.854, P=0.376,respectively,obtainedfromasymptomatic chi-square distributions ( 33)], suggesting robust predictive performance of the proposed model.Discussion In this secondary data analysis among Cambodian women of reproductive age, we found that Hb (Analyzer), inflammation-adjusted ferritin, hepcidin, and inflammation-adjusted TBIS were the strongest univariate predictors of a 12-week Hb response to iron supplementation when compared against Hb(HemoCue), sTfR, reticulocyte Hb content, MCV, TIBC, and transferrin saturation.
Unexpectedly, these four hematological biomarkers were all very similar in their predictive ability(AUC ROCvalues ranged between 0.81 to 0.83) and, not surprisingly,the combined use of three of these biomarkers [Hb (Analyzer), inflammation-adjusted ferritin, hepcidin] providedan even greater predictive power (AUC ROC=0.86) in our multivariate analysis.Hb concentration has often been thought to be a poor indicator of a response to iron therapy, as anemiacan be caused by many factors other than iron deficiency ( 34). Consequently,we were surprised to see that baseline Hb (when measured with a hematology analyzer) performed similar toinflammation-adjustedferritin(adirectmarkerofironstores)in predicting a Hb response to iron supplementation.Ultimately, this is a positive finding given that the WHO currently usespopulation-level anemia prevalence to guide recommendations for untargeted iron supplementation ( 4).
Of note, we observed that Hb as measured with an auto- mated hematology analyzer was a better diagnostic predictor of Hb response compared to Hb as measured with a HemoCue (AUC ROC=0.81 vs 0.65, respectively). We speculate this may be due to the inherent limitations of the HemoCue device that result in higher measurement inaccuracy ( 35–37), such as differences in the comparison of capillary compared with venous blood and/or fasting compared with nonfasting samples (38).The inconsistency between these two measurements could also be due to issues related to the statistical phenomenon Predictors of a hemoglobin response to iron 2259 FIGURE 2 ROC curves illustrating the diagnostic ability of single hematological biomarkers (univariate predictors) in predicting hemoglobin response among enrolled Cambodian women.

In Cambodia, the homozygous Hb EE disorder is a severe form that has been associated with significantly lower Hb concentrations in women ( 43); women with this disorder would be less likely to experience a Hbresponse to iron supplementation. In our study, only ∼13% (n=51/383) of women had a Hb EE disorder; as such, there was limited ability to investigate how the prognostic modeldiffered in those with this severe form of hemoglobinopathy.However, we highlight that a significantly higher proportion of women with the Hb EE disorder was observed amongHb nonresponders ( n=46/288; 16%) as compared to Hb responders ( n=5/95; 5%; Table 1).
We note that predictive hematological biomarkers may vary for those with genetic TABLE 2 Optimal thresholds and corresponding sensitivity and specificity values of the baseline hematological biomarkers identified as the best univariate predictors of hemoglobin response among enrolled Cambodian women who received 12 weeks of ironsupplementation 1 Optimalthreshold2Sensitivity SpecificitySumofsensitivity andspecificity Hemoglobin(Analyzer),g/L 114 0.80 0.67 1.47Inflammation-adjustedferritin, μg/L 17.3 0.70 0.89 1.59 Hepcidin,nmol/L 1.98 0.73 0.84 1.57 Inflammation-adjustedTBIS,mg/kg 1.95 0.71 0.88 1.59 1TBIS, total body iron stores. 2Optimal thresholds were derived using a metric of the sum of sensitivity and specificity.For each of these threshold values, a measurement below the th reshold suggests the individual would be likely to respond to iron supplementation, whereas a measurement above the threshold indicates the individual would be unlikely to experience a hemoglobin response.

Hb disorders (especially for the Hb EE disorder), suggesting the need for further research investigating how Hb responsepredictorsmaydifferinindividualswiththesedisorders.Future consideration of the presence of genetic hemoglobinopathies, or other factors that may alter the Hb response to ironsupplementation, is warranted. The AUC ROCfor ferritin was higher in our study than that observed in a similar trial in Vietnam ( 46).Pasricha et al.
(46) investigated the effects of 12 weeks of once- weekly iron and folic acid supplementation on Hb response in anemic Vietnamese women of reproductive age and observedanAUC ROCforferritinof0.68(95%CI,0.55–0.81).Onemight havespeculatedthattherewouldbeanequalorhigherAUCROC in the Vietnam study, given that all women were anemic and hadreceiveddewormingtreatment(whichmayhavetreatedany anemia or iron deficiency that was due to parasitic infection); however,the iron supplement was only provided as 60 mg onceweekly (compared with 60 mg daily in our study), which may have contributed to a lower AUC ROCvalue. It may also be that therewereothercausesofanemiaandirondeficiencyinwomenof these two studies that were not related to low iron intakes, which could have contributed to differences observed in the AUC ROCvalues.The discrimination threshold analysis of Hb (Analyzer) revealedslightdeviationsfromtheWHO-recommendedcutoffs.
The WHO currently recommends a Hb cutoff of 120 g/L for nonpregnant women of reproductive age ( 47); our study indicated a threshold of 114 g/L was ideal (based on the sumof sensitivity and specificity) to predict a Hb response. Of course, defining an optimal cutoff for a diagnostic test should consider the trade-offs of sensitivity and specificity measures.For Hb cutoffs, increased sensitivity (the ability to correctly identify individuals with anemia) usually comes at the expense ofreducedspecificity(theabilitytocorrectlyidentifyindividualswithout anemia).
Some may argue that increased sensitivity is more important in identifying a cutoff for Hb, because the consequences of false positives are less severe than those offalse negatives.For example,if a pregnant woman is incorrectly diagnosed as nonanemic (false negative), she misses out on the prescription of iron supplements that may correct irondeficiency anemia and reduce the risk of an adverse birth outcome.Of note,the WHO is currently developing new global recommendationsonHbthresholdstodiagnoseanemiainbothclinical and public health practice ( 48), which may result in some future updates in this field of work. Similar to the lower threshold detected in our study for Hb, there was also a slight deviation from the current WHO- recommended cutoff for ferritin, which is 15 μg/L for women (32); our study indicated a threshold of 17.3 μg/L was ideal (based on the sum of sensitivity and specificity).
Conversely,others have suggested a higher threshold ( ∼30μg/L) for ferritin for improved sensitivity ( 46,49). Our value is based on inflammation-adjusted ferritin, which may explain why it is lower than these higher cutoffs that others have suggested (cor- rection for inflammation will adjust ferritin values downward).There is now global consensus to adjust ferritin concentrations in the presence of inflammation ( 50).The central regulatory role that hepcidin plays in iron homeostasis suggests it could be a promising diagnostic biomarker for iron-related disorders ( 51).To date, there has been no consensus on a cutoff for hepcidin that can be used asan indicator of low iron status or for estimating the likelihood of a Hb response to iron therapy.The results from our study suggest the strong diagnostic ability of serum hepcidin inpredicting a Hb response to daily oral iron supplementation (AUC ROC=0.82).
Further, we found that a hepcidin threshold of 1.98 nmol/L (based on the sum of sensitivity and specificity)wasidealtoidentifythosewomenwhowerelikelytoexperience a Hb response. Our findings differ from those observed in a study conducted among 261 nonanemic female blood donorsevaluating hepcidin as a novel test of iron deficiency ( 52).Pasricha et al.( 52) found that a hepcidin concentration cutoff of ∼2.87 nmol/L (8 ng/mL) achieved maximal correct classification,while a cutoff of ∼6.38 nmol/L (17.8 ng/mL) was optimal when considering the sum of sensitivity and specificity values.Deviations in these values are likely due to differences in the study cohort (predominantly anemic rural Cambodian women compared with nonanemic Australian women), theconsideration of a different outcome variable (Hb response to iron supplementation compared with iron deficiency), and possible variation in hepcidin values due to the differentassays used for hepcidin measurements.
Further investigation is warranted in the use of hepcidin as a diagnostic marker for iron deficiency; however,the large variability of serum hepcidinconcentrationsbetweenindividuals( 51)maylimitthefeasibility of determining an individual-level threshold to diagnose iron deficiency.Therearelimiteddataonthecomparisonofhepcidinassays,andeffortsareunderwaytostandardizeassays;however, we recognize this as a limitation of the use of this biomarker in general. An increase of 10 g/L was selected as a Hb response that would indicate iron deficiency anemia ( 24,25); however, individuals with mild anemia may require a much smallerincrease in Hb to resolve iron deficiency anemia ( 46).The threshold of 10 g/L is the value most commonly used globally in this context ( 11,46).We explored whether the selection of a lower threshold to define a Hb response (5 g/L compared with 10 g/L) resulted in a change in discrimination ability (AUC ROC) for the ten hematological biomarkers.
Interestingly, we found that all ten biomarkers were less sensitive (had lower Predictors of a hemoglobin response to iron 2261 discriminationabilityasdefinedbyAUCROC)inpredictingaHb response when using a 5 g/L compared to a 10 g/L threshold to define the Hb response. ThelikelihoodofanHbresponsecanhelpascertainwhether or not it is justified to prescribe iron supplementation to an individual.This would enable a more individualized guidelineforironsupplementationprograms,providingtreatmentonlyto those who are expected to respond, rather than using universal blanket supplementation programs.However, we recognize thechallenges of measuring some of these biomarkers in low- resource settings.
The assessment of ferritin and hepcidin concentrations requires the collection of venous blood (forserum or plasma), centrifugation, and processing with more complex analytical methods than are usually found in the field in low-resource countries.The personnel and consumablesrequired for the collection,and the potential transport of blood for centrifugation and analysis, require substantial resources. Until a simple and accurate point-of-care device to measureferritin or hepcidin is developed, the challenges will continue.Collaborativeeffortsamongengineers,chemists,andlaboratory technologists would help drive this work forward with hopesfor improved technology and point-of-care devices for ferritin and hepcidin in the future.
In the meantime, our findings that baselineHb,whenmeasuredwithuseofahematologyanalyzer,is as strong a predictor of Hb response as inflammation- adjusted ferritin, hepcidin, and inflammation-adjusted TBIS is positive, especially given that it is an inexpensive and easy biomarker to measure ( 10) and that current global guide- lines for iron supplementation are based on population-levelanemia p ( 4).
