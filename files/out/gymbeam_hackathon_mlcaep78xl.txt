Twenty adults (18–70 yrs)withT1D (�6months duration) withsuboptimal glycaemic control (HbA1c>7.0% or>53mmol/mol) participated ina16-week single armwithin-par tic- ipant, controlled intervention study involving a4-week control period following their habit- ualdiets (>150 g/day ofcarbohydrates) anda12-week intervention period following aLC diet(25–75 g/day ofcarbohydrates) delivered remotely byaregistered dietitian. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c –primary outcome), time inrange (blood glucose: 3.5–10.0 mmol/L), frequency ofhypoglycaemia (<3.5 mmol/L), total daily insulin, andquality oflifewere assessed before andafter thecontrol andintervention periods.Sixteen participants com- pleted thestudy.
During theintervention period, there were reductions intotal dietary car- bohydrate intake (214 to63g/day; P<0.001), HbA1c (7.7to7.1% or61to54mmol/mol; P =0.003) andtotal daily insulin use(65to49U/day; P<0.001), increased time spent in range (59to74%; P<0.001), andimproved quality oflife(P=0.015), withnosignificant changes observed during thecontrol period. Frequency ofhypoglycaemia episodes did notdiffer across timepoints, andnoepisodes ofketoacidosis orother adverse events were reported during theintervention period.These preliminary findings suggest thata professionally supported LCdietmay lead toimprovements inmarkers ofblood glucose control andquality oflifewithreduced exogenous insulin requirement sandnoevidence of increased hypoglycaemia orketoacidosis riskinadults withT1D.Given thepotential ben- efitsofthisintervention, larger, longer-term randomised controlled trials arewarranted to confirm these findings.

Introduction Type 1diabetes (T1D) isanautoimmune condition characterised bypancreatic beta cell destruction, absolute insulin deficiency, and impaired glucose metabolism [1].Despite mod- ernadvancements inglucose monitoring and insulin delivery technologies, many individuals with T1D experience high variability inblood glucose levels and difficulties achieving glycae- mic targets (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c]�7.0% or�53 mmol/mol) [2–6], increasing the riskforseveral acute and chronic health complications including cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1,3,7–13]. Consequently, effective treatment strategies that achieve glycated haemo- globin targets while minimising thefrequency and severity ofhyper- and hypoglycaemia are needed.
Dietary carbohydrates significantly influence post-prandial blood glucose levels and individuals with T1D arerecommended toquantify carbohydrate intake (known as‘car- bohydrate counting’) topredict rises inpost-prandial glucose levels and administer appro- priate insulin dosages formeals and snacks [3].Authoritative bodies including the National Health &Medical Research Council (NHMRC), recommend individuals with T1D follow theNational Dietary Guidelines which promote ahigh-carbohydrate diet (HC; 45–65% oftotal energy intake [TEI]) [3,14]. Arecent analysis oftheAustralian Health Survey showed that dietary intakes ofadults with T1D were consistent with these recommendations [15].However, data from theAustralian National Diabetes Audit report that average HbA1c levels remain at8.4% (68mmol/mol) inthis clinical population [16], suggesting that alternative dietary approaches could beconsidered toimprove glycaemic control.
Inadults with type 2diabetes (T2D), randomised controlled trials have repeatedly dem- onstrated that low-carbohydrat e(LC) diets (�130 g/day or26% TEI from carbohydrates) achieve greater reductions inHbA1c and anti-glycaemic medications, with greater increases inHDL-cholesterol and decreases intriglycerides, when compared totraditional HCdiets [17–19]. Conversely, fewhigh quality studies have investigated therole ofLCdiets inadults with T1D [20].In2018, thefirst published systematic review examining theeffects oflower- carbohydrate diets (<45% TEI) forT1D management reported that thethree included stud- iesexamining LCdiets (<26% TEI; excluding case reports) achieved mean HbA1c reduc- tions between 0.7–1.3% [20–23], and diets with�100 g/day ofcarbohydrates ledto concurrent reductions intotal daily insulin use[21–23].
Further, a2019 randomised cross- over trial conducted in10adults with T1D showed that a12-week LCdiet (~100 g/day) resulted inlesstime spent with blood glucose levels below 3.9mmol/L and lower glycaemic variability compared toaHCdiet (~250 g/day) [24]. Arecent retrospective analysis ofadults with T1D who self-selected tofollow aprofessionally supported LCdiet (~60 g/day ofcarbo- hydrates) reported reductions inHbA1c, fasting blood glucose levels, and total daily insulin use, with increased time spent intarget glucose ranges [25].Despite preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness ofLCdiets forT1D management, lack ofconsensus from authorita- tivebodies and healthcare professionals regarding theuseand feasibility ofLCdiets for patients with T1D remains [26–28], and further prospective interventional studies are needed.
The objective ofthisstudy wastocompare theeffects ofaprofessionally supported LCdiet intervention with habitual diets higher incarbohydrates onclinical markers including HbA1c, glycaemic variability, frequency ofhypoglycaemia, total daily insulin (TDI), and quality oflife inadults with T1D. Itwashypothesised that that aLCdiet intervention would achieve greater improvements inclinical markers ofT1D management.PLOS ONEAlow-carbo hydrate dietintype1diabetes PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02884 40July11,2023 2/22Funding: Thisstudy hasbeen partially funded by TheCommonwe althScientifi candIndustrial Research Organisa tion(CSIRO) whokindly donated $6000 AUD tothisresearch project.We alsoraised philanthr opicfunds (Universit yof Sydney crowd-sou rcing platform) totheamount of ~$7000 AUD tocover remaining costs.TheType 1 Diabetes Family Centre agreed toreimburse the study diabetes educator fortheirtime(upto30 hours) sotheycould perform theirnecessary role inthisresearch.

Since multiple lifestyle factors influence T1D management, and with consideration ofindividual personal needs and preferences, asingle arm within-patient intervention study where participants act astheir own controls was deemed tobethemost appropriate design. The primary outcome was HbA1c.Secondary outcomes were glycaemic variability (GV), frequency ofhypoglycae- mia, total daily insulin use, and quality oflife.The study protocol containing fulldetails of this clinical trial hasbeen published elsewhere [29].While originally intended tobedeliv- ered in-person, thetrial commenced during COVID-19 lockdowns (Sydney, July 2021) and was completed remotely initsentirety, using Telehealth and remote testing services that per- mitted Australia-wide participation.The most recent version ofthestudy protocol reflecting these updates isavailable assupporting information, alongside theTREND checklist for non-randomised trials (S1File, S1Table).
Data collection commenced inJuly 2021 and was completed inJuly 2022. This trial was reviewed and approved bytheUniversity ofSydney Human Research Ethics Committee (project number: 2021/080) and prospectively regis- tered with theAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) (https://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN1262100 0764831.aspx).Allparticipants provided written informed consent.Participants Participants were recruited viapublic advertisement, including posters/flyers displayed onsocial media from July 2021 toMarch 2022.Eligible participants were aged 18–70 years with abody mass index (BMI) between 18.5–39.9 kg/m2,confirmed diagnosis of T1D (�6 months), using multiple daily insulin injections oraninsulin pump, and an HbA1c>7.0% (>53 mmol/mol).
Participants were required toprovide written evidence oftheir HbA1c result (e.g., pathology report, specialist letter) measured within three months ofscreening, and were notexcluded iftheir HbA1c reduced�7.0% (�53 mmol/ mol) atthetime ofstudy commencement. Participants had toreside within Australia for theduration ofthetrial and have ahabitual intake ofdigestible carbohydrates >150 g/ day.
Exclusion criteria included: non-English speaking; habitual useofanautomated insulin delivery system and/or adherence toafixed insulin regimen; previously diagnosed hypo-unawareness; habitual dietary intake strictly excluding animal-based proteins (e.g., vegan diet); recent pregnancy orlactation (�6 months); self-identifies ascurrent orrecent smoker (�6 months); recent weight change>10% body weight (�3 months); aknown family history ofheart disease; previously diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolaemia, gastrointestinal disease (not including irritable bowel syndrome, coeliac disease orstable inflammatory bowel disease), liver disease (not including fatty liver), chronic kidney dis- ease (eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73m2),respiratory disease (not including stable treated asthma), thyroid disease (not including stable treated hyper- orhypothyroidism) orCVD; or,previously diagnosed with aneating disorder. Patients ofthestudy investigators were also excluded.
Prior tostudy commencement, participants were required tonominate and confirm amember oftheir usual diabetes care team proficient ininsulin management (endocrinologist, general practitioner, ordiabetes educator) toprovide ongoing support throughout thestudy. PLOS ONEAlow-carbo hydrate dietintype1diabetes PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02884 40July11,2023 3/22 Control period Details ofthecontrol period have been reported elsewhere [29].Inbrief, thestudy dietitian (J.L.T.) instructed participants tomaintain habitual eating, exercise and T1D management throughout theinitial 4-week control period.Participants were provided with standard diabe- teseducation and instructed totesttheir blood glucose levels sixtimes daily forself-monitor- ingpurposes [3,30].Diet intervention Details ofthedietary intervention arereported elsewhere [29].
Inbrief, thestudy dietitian met with participants individually viaZoom video conferencing (Zoom) onsixoccasions (60min each) throughout the12-week diet intervention period toprovide instruction, education, and strategies tofollow aLCdiet. The LCdiet prescription wasinformed byapublished systematic review assessing previously reported LCdiet interventions shown tobesafe and effective for improving glycaemic control inadults with T2D [31].The carbohydrate prescription started at 50gofdigestible carbohydrates perday, with opportunity tobeadapted within abroader range of25–75 g/day according toindividual blood glucose levels and personal preference.Participants were encouraged todistribute carbohydrates evenly across thedaysuch that total carbohydrates didnotexceed 20gatasingle eating occasion.
Dietary education incorporated information onthepost-prandial effect(s) ofcarbohydrates, proteins and fats, including carbo- hydrate and protein counting, given theneed toconsider protein incalculating meal-time insulin requirements with habitual carbohydrate restriction<100 g/day [32]. Participants were provided with aneducational booklet containing sample meal plans, troubleshooting tips, and ideas formeals and snacks.Examples ofthemeal plans for25g/day, 50g/day and 60 g/day ofdietary carbohydrates areprovided asS2–S4 Tables.Consumption ofwhole foods was emphasised and afood listshowing options forproteins, fats, and carbohydrates wasprovided.Noupper intake limit onrecommended sources ofproteins and fatswasprovided.Alcohol intake recommendations forthegeneral population were provided [33].Participants were encouraged tomaintain their usual physical activity level throughout thestudy duration.
Participants were instructed toperform usual care practice self-monitoring blood glucose readings before and twohours after each meal (measured using their own blood glucose moni- toring device) forinsulin calculations and adjustments throughout thestudy. Blood glucose targets were consistent with standard practice fordiabetes management (4–8 mmol/L when fasting and before meals, and 4–10 mmol/L twohours after starting meals) [3,30].Participants were instructed tomeasure blood ketones atleast twice perweek, and more frequently iffeel- ingunwell, and were tomaintain ketones�0.6 mmol/L byfollowing their sick daymanage- ment plan, asperstandard diabetes practices [3,34].Participants were provided aninformation booklet about insulin management onaLCdiet and received access toshort, pre-recorded videos (3–5 minutes each) bythestudy diabetes educator (A.R.) explaining thisinformation.
Participants were provided theopportunity to meet with thestudy diabetes educator viaZoom foratleast one30-minute session during the intervention period todiscuss questions relating todiabetes management onaLCdiet. Partici- pants were provided fortnightly reminders tofollow upwith their nominated healthcare prac- titioner forindividualised advice oninsulin titrations.The participants’ other medications such asoral anti-glycaemic and anti-hypertensive agents were assessed prior tocommencing theintervention bythestudy physician (D.L.) to develop amedication management plan that informed participants’ usual GPoftheexpected adjustments that may berequired with adherence toaLCdiet.PLOS ONEAlow-carbo hydrate dietintype1diabetes PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02884 40July11,2023 4/22 Outcome measures Outcomes were measured atthree time-points: (1)pre-control period (-4weeks), (2)post-con- trol(0weeks), and (3)post-intervention period (12weeks).
HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, kid- neyfunction (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, urea, creatinine, eGFR, calcium, corrected calcium, phosphate, uric acid), liver function (total protein, albumin, alkaline phos- phatase, total bilirubin, GGT, AST, ALT, globulin, magnesium, creatine kinase), and lipid studies (total cholesterol, lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides) were assessed from fasting blood samples collected and ana- lysed bylocally available NATA-accredited laboratories using standard procedures. Partici- pants were advised tofast(water asrequired) for10–12 hours and avoid strenuous exercise 24-hours prior toblood testing.Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices were provided toparticipants (Medtronic Australasia iPro2 orGuardian Connect, depending onavailability) toobtain 24-hr interstitial glucose concentrations forseven days ateach data collection timepoint.
Participants unwilling orunable tousetheCGM provided used their own commercially available device. Raw data were entered into theEasyGV platform (EasyGV Version 9.0.R2, University ofOxford, Oxford, UK) forcalculation ofglycaemic variability (GV) indices including standard deviation ofblood glucose (SDBG), mean amplitude ofglycaemic excursions (MAGE), and mean blood glucose.Time inrange (TIR) wascalculated byoneresearcher (J.L.T.) toidentify thepercent- ageofdatapoints within 3.5–10.0 mmol/L across theentire data collection period.Frequency ofhypoglycaemia wasdefined asthenumber ofevents<3.5 mmol/L with orwithout symp- toms.GVdata were analysed with and excluding days that hadincomplete values (<80% avail- able datapoints), butnomeaningful differences were identified.Data without exclusions (i.e., allCGM data regardless ofcompleteness) were used fortheprimary analysis; analysis ofdata with exclusions areprovided intheS5Table.
Total daily insulin (TDI) wasdefined asthesum ofallbasal and bolus insulin given over a 24-hour period derived from a3-day self-report insulin log.Participants using insulin pumps were provided theoption toprovide pump summary reports instead ofcompleting theinsulin log. Anthropometric outcomes, including BMI, waist circumference, and resting blood pressure were measured byalocal healthcare professional (i.e., local pharmacist, GP, nurse).Incases where participants were unable orunwilling toleave their homes during COVID-19 lock- downs, self-reported measures were provided.Quality oflifewasassessed using theDiabetes-related Quality ofLife (DQoL) Brief Clinical Inventory [35] completed online.The 15-item questionnaire isaquantitative assessment for theperceptions ofhow diabetes mellitus affects daily function [35, 36].
Items areranked ona 5-point Likert scale (1=“very satisfied” or“never” upto5=“very unsatisfied” or“con- stantly”), with thesum ofall15items providing atotal score from 15to75.Alower score implies amore satisfactory quality oflife. Participants completed 3-day weighed food records using thesmartphone app,Easy DietDiary (Xyris, version 6.0.28, Australia), ateach data collection timepoint.Data was analysed bythestudy dietitian (J.L.T.) usingFoodWorks Professional Edition (Xyris, ver- sion 10,Australia) toassess dietary intake (total energy, total digestible carbohydrate, die- tary fibre, protein, total fat,saturated fat,and alcohol).Diet satisfaction was assessed using a6-item questionnaire previously used inT2D research [37], and total physical activity level (PAL) was measured using theInternational Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [38].
PLOS ONEAlow-carbo hydrate dietintype1diabetes PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02884 40July11,2023 5/22 Statistical analyses The primary outcome wasthechange(s) inHbA1c across timepoints (pre-control, post-con- trol, and post-intervention). Based onaclinically relevant difference inHbA1c of0.7% (abso- lute), with astandard deviation of1.0,toachieve 80% power with alpha<0.05, asample sizeof n=16wasdetermined using apaired t-test ofcomparisons [22].The primary analysis was conducted onparticipants with complete data only, and secondary analysis wasconducted on anintention-to-treat (ITT) basis with thelastrecorded measurement carried forward formiss- ingvalues.Prior toanalysis, data wasassessed fornormality bytwoinvestigators (K.B.R.and J.L.T.) using histograms and PP-plots.Parametric and nonparametric data were assessed using repeated measures ANOVA and theFriedman test, respectively, todetermine within-group differences across timepoints.
Ifasignificant main effect wasidentified (p<0.05), post hoc analysis using paired t-tests (parametric) orWilcoxon signed-rank tests (non-parametric) was performed tocompare twopairs (pre-control vs.post-control and post-control vs.post-inter- vention) with aBonferroni correction applied, resulting inasignificance level setatp<0.025. Data arepresented asmeans and standard deviations (SD) (normally distributed data) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) (non-normally distributed data) foreach timepoint.Statistical analyses were conducted usingSPSSStatistics (released 2021, IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 28;Armonk, New York).

Discussion This single-arm longitudinal intervention study showed that ahealthcare professional sup- ported 12-week LCdiet (25–75 g/day) improved markers ofblood glucose control and quality oflifewith reduced total daily insulin dosages and noreported episodes ofketoacidosis or severe hypoglycaemia. These preliminary results suggest that aprofessionally supported LC diet may beasafe and effective approach forT1D management, yetlarger randomised con- trolled trials areneeded toconfirm ourfindings.The 0.6% reduction inmean HbA1c levels observed during theintervention period iscon- sidered relatively large and clinically significant, considering that post-intervention HbA1c levels were 7.1% (54mmol/mol) with 44% ofparticipants reaching thediabetes target of HbA1c�7.0% (�53 mmol/mol) [3,39].
The present results aresimilar toprevious studies in T1D that reported HbA1c reductions from 7.9to7.2% (63to55mmol/mol) with a12-week LCdiet (~100 g/day ofcarbohydrates) (n=5)[21] and from 7.6to6.9% (60to52mmol/mol) ona4-year LCdiet (�75 g/day) (n=48)[22]. A1%reduction inHbA1c hasbeen reported to reduce theriskofdeath related todiabetes by21%, myocardial infarction by14%, and micro- vascular complications by37% [40].However, HbA1c reductions aslowas0.3% areconsid- ered clinically meaningful forreducing diabetes-related complications over thelong-term [41, 42].Inthepresent study, concurrently with theHbA1c reductions, total daily insulin reduced (65to49U/day).This iscomparable toresults reported byboth Krebs (66to44U/day) and Nielsen (43to32U/day) [21, 22].
Data from theDiabetes Control and Complications Trial showed anincreased risk ofsevere hypoglycaemia and excessive weight gain with intensive insulin therapy highlighting thenecessity forinterventions that achieve glycaemic control without reliance onlarge insulin doses [43–45]. GVisincreasingly recognised asauseful indicator forriskofmicro- and macrovascular complications inT1D [46–48].The current study showed improvements inGVmetrics after theLCdiet intervention.Intheonly other known study tohave examined theeffects ofaLC diet onGVinindividuals with T1D for12weeks, Schmidt etal.[24] showed SDBG waslow- ered with aLCdiet (<100 g/day) compared toaHCdiet (>250 g/day); however nodifferences inTIR (65and 69% respectively within 3.9–10 mmol/L) were observed.Inthepresent study, themean TIR (3.5–10 mmol/L) of74% after theLCintervention wassignificantly higher com- pared when towhen ahigher-carbohydrate diet wasconsumed during thecontrol period (TIR: 55–59%).
The specific reason(s) forthediscrepant findings isnotclear; however, partici- pants inthepresent study hadlower TIR values atbaseline and followed their habitual diet during thecontrol period, whereas participants intheprevious study followed asupported HC diet intervention which may have yielded better glycaemic control [24]. The level ofcarbohy- drate intake inthepresent study wasalso lower (25–75 g/day vs.100g/day), suggesting the possibility that thedegree ofimprovement inTIR could berelated tothedegree ofcarbohy- drate restriction.Dose-response effects have been reported inT2D patients, showing lower HbA1c levels with greater carbohydrate restriction [18].Future studies should beconducted to confirm thepresent findings and toidentify thespecific factor/s responsible forimproved TIR inT1D participants following aLCdiet.Interestingly, amodest butclinically significant reduction inbody weight (3%, -2.4 kg)dur- ingthe12-week LCdiet wasobserved.
This isconsistent with LCdiet studies conducted in T2D populations [17, 49]. Sustained weight reductions of2–5% have shown significant bene- fitsinimproving CVD risk factors, including SBP and serum triglycerides [50].The exact PLOS ONEAlow-carbo hydrate dietintype1diabetes PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02884 40July11,2023 12/22 reason(s) fortheobserved weight reduction cannot bedetermined from theavailable data.Pre- vious research report increased satiety levels with adherence toLCdiets [51–54] that may lead tospontaneous reductions intotal energy intake despiteadlibitum energy prescriptions.This issupported bythedietary intake data that showed a15% reduction inreported energy intake during theLCdiet intervention (-1392 kJ/day).Another body ofevidence demonstrates that insulin cansuppress lipolysis [55, 56], and reductions incirculating insulin levels may influ- ence long-term adiposity and body weight change [43, 57,58].
Interventions that promote adi- posity reduction areimportant intheT1D population, with obesity rates rising rapidly over recent years [59]. Itispossible that LCdiets could provide aneffective weight management strategy forindividuals living with T1D who arealso overweight orobese.Future studies should examine thelong-term effects (>12 weeks) ofLCdiets onweight management and diet sustainability inT1D.Further, randomised controlled trials which aim tocontrol forthe potential effect(s) ofweight lossonglycaemic control outcomes under energy balance condi- tions arealso worthy ofconsideration.There areseveral often cited potential safety concerns regarding theuseofLCdiets includ- ingincreased risk ofhypoglycaemia inT1D [26, 60,61]and negative impact(s) onquality of life[62].
Conversely, thecurrent study showed nodifference inthenumber ofhypoglycaemic episodes between theLCdiet intervention and thecontrol phase when ahabitual HCdiet was consumed, and quality oflifeimproved more during theLCdiet. Previous research inT1D also showed that lower-carbohydrate diets reduced episodes ofsevere hypoglycaemia [63], and arecent randomised crossover trial demonstrated lesstime spent with blood glucose <3.9 mmol/L during adherence toaLCdiet compared toaHCdiet [24].Similar tothepresent findings, apilot study ofadults living with T1D also reported that aLCdiet (<100 g/day) led toimprovements inglycaemic control without negatively impacting quality oflife[64].How- ever, previous studies examining theeffect(s) ofLCdiets onT1D management didnotmea- sure changes inquality oflife[20].
Collectively, thedata suggests that LCdiet may reduce hypoglycaemia and improve quality oflifeinindividuals with T1D; however, further well-con- trolled studies arerequired toconfirm these effects. Improvements inglycaemic control observed with LCdiets areoften dismissed bycon- comitant increases inLDL-cholesterol (LDL) levels reported insome [65–69], butnotall studies [70, 71].Inthepresent study, nosignificant differences inLDL were observed between thecontrol and LCdiet phases, despite substantial increases inself-reported satu- rated fatintake, which hasbeen shown toelevated LDL levels [72–74].Itisworth noting that many participants were taking cholesterol-lowering medication which may have mini- mised potential increases inLDL.Nevertheless, thestrength ofLDL asapredictor ofCVD remains heavily debated [75], and arecent systematic review showed noassociation between total LDL and mortality inolder adults [76].
Measuring lipid subfractions, rather than total LDL, isanimportant consideration forfuture research astheamount ofsmall-dense LDL may beamore reliable marker ofCVD risk [77, 78]. Atthis time, itremains prudent that healthcare practitioners consider thevarying impact ofLCdiets oncholesterol levels, and closely monitor CVD risk using arange ofhealth markers including HbA1c, GVand body weight.Astrength ofthecurrent study isthat itwasconducted inareal-world remote care setting that improves translatability into clinical practice.The intervention wasdelivered byaregis- tered dietitian viaremote contact, and participants were notrequired totravel outside oftheir local area foroutcome measurements.
With consideration oftherecent transition toward Tel- ehealth services [79], and thepotential forenhanced accessibility tohealthcare forpeople living outside ofmetropolitan areas and/or those with limited time toattend health clinics, evidence- based remote care interventions have important relevance inthecurrent health climate. PLOS ONEAlow-carbo hydrate dietintype1diabetes PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02884 40July11,2023 13/22 Additionally, therelatively broad eligibility criteria that facilitated inclusion ofindividuals with common comorbidities (obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and depression) increases thetranslatability ofthese findings, although itshould beacknowledged that thismay have introduced greater heterogeneity ofthedata collected.
Ithasalso been reported that the COVID-19 pandemic wasassociated with increased body weight and poorer mental health, likely resulting from changes towork environments, lifestyle behaviours, and eating habits [80, 81]. The present findings suggest theLCdiet intervention implemented inthisstudy wasable tocounteract these effect(s).The study hasseveral limitations.The single-arm longitudinal study design precludes the ability todirectly compare theeffects ofaLCdiet intervention toaHCdiet intervention, and therelatively small sample sizeand short follow-up period (12weeks) reduces generalisability ofthepresent findings.However, while notarandomised controlled trial, thecurrent within- participant controlled intervention study assists tominimise thepotential influences ofinher- entindividual differences ofdiet and non-diet factors that influence T1D management and blood glucose levels [82–87].
Future studies should usearandomised crossover design with larger participant numbers and alonger follow-up period (>12 weeks) toassess differences between LCand HCdiet interventions forT1D management, improve generalisability of results, and todetermine whether intervention effects aremaintained. Further, lack of resources restricted health-professional support provisions todietitian-only with limited sup- port from adiabetes educator toprovide specific insulin titration advice.Engagement from theparticipants’ usual healthcare practitioners waslowand participants experienced chal- lenges managing required changes tobasal and bolus insulin dosages whilst following theLC diet.Additionally, some participants experienced difficulties managing conflicting dietary advice from other healthcare professionals.Anonline survey of316individuals with T1D reported that themajority ofparticipants didnotfeelsupported bytheir healthcare team tofol- lowavery LCdiet [88].
Aprevious systematic review ofadults with T2D showed that effective LCdiet studies included moderate tohigh frequency offollow-up with medical professionals [31], that may also beanintegral feature ofother successful dietary interventions [89, 90]. For patients toachieve improved health outcomes with amultidisciplinary team approach, upskill- ingofhealthcare practitioners may berequired toincrease confidence inmanaging patients using arange ofsafe and effective dietary approaches, which could include LCdiets.With that said, ahigh frequency offollow-up with healthcare professionals (i.e., once every fortnight), as used inthecurrent study, may notbewidely accessible and future researchers may wish to develop and evaluate strategies aimed atsupporting patients between consultations topromote safety and adherence.Inthepresent study, theLCdiet intervention prescribed theconsumption ofminimally- processed whole foods and tominimise theintake ofultra-processed foods.
However, due to thepreliminary nature ofthis single arm study that didnotassess diet quality, itisdifficult todetermine thespecific effect(s) ofchanges indiet quality onthefavourable metabolic changes observed. Prioritisation ofminimally-processed foods hasbeen identified asacore feature ofsafe and effective LCdiet interventions used inT2D management [31].Inaddi- tion, common health-promoting dietary patterns, such astheMediterranean diet, also prior- itise consumption ofminimally-processed foods such asdairy, nuts, seeds, legumes, meat, fish, and eggs, while limiting ultra-processed foods [91, 92].Future randomised controlled studies should aim tocontrol forthepotential impact(s) ofdiet quality onT1D management outcomes when comparing LCdiets with diets higher incarbohydrates.Nevertheless, it would beprudent toconsider diet quality inthedesign and delivery ofLCdiets inclinical practice.
