Methods: From August 1, 2021, to May 31, 2023, 9482 blood tablets were received for the screening of VA and VE. The infor - mation was divided into four different age groups: ≤ 1 year old, 1< to ≤ 6 years, 6< to ≤ 17 years, and 17< to ≤ 59 years.In each age group, the four seasons were further subdivided into spring, summer, autumn, and winter, as well as male and female genders.The serum concentration of VA and VE was detected by liquid chromatography—tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC- MS), and the reference range was established for verification.Results: The concentration of VA and VE in 9482 cases showed skewed distribution.When comparing between different age groups, the serum concentration of VA and VE was statistically significant ( p < 0.05).While comparing different seasons, the serum VA levels in different seasons were significantly different ( p < 0.05) except in summer and autumn.There was statistical significance in VE level in different seasons ( p < 0.05).
And while comparing different genders, there was no statistical signifi - cance in VA concentration levels ( p > 0.05). The VE concentration levels were statistically significant ( p < 0.05).The established reference range was established and verified, and the results were in accordance with the standard.Conclusion: The reference range of VA and VE should be set according to different ages, different seasons, and different genders.1 | Introduction Vitamins are essential trace organic substances for humans and animals, which are crucial in the process of body growth, me - tabolism, and development, and are also necessary conditions for maintaining normal physiological functions [ 1, 2].Vitamin A (VA) and vitamin E (VE) are common vitamins that play an important role in all stages of human life, and their deficit and excess can affect human health [ 3, 4].
Vitamin A has a wide range of biological effects, mainly closely related to embryonic development, hematopoietic, immune function, vision, etc. [ 5, 6]; its deficiency can lead to eye- related diseases, such as decreased dark adaptability and night blindness, and even blindness [ 7], whereas its excess can cause acute, chronic, and teratogenic toxicity [ 8].Vitamin E is essential for nervous system develop - ment, growth, and immunity [ 9, 10 ].A relevant study has shown that VE deficiency mainly leads to nervous system abnormali - ties, anemia, cardiovascular diseases, pneumonia, asthma, and This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made.© 2024 The Author(s).

All group comparison data were tested for normality using the “one- sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.” For those with normal distribution, the independent sample t- test was used for comparison between two groups, and single factor analysis of variance was used for compari - son between multiple groups. Nonparametric tests were used for non- normal distributions.The outliers were removed by Tukey's method, and the reference interval was repre - sented by P2.5– P97.5.p < 0.01 or p < 0.05 was considered sta - tistically significant.If there is no statistical significance, the two sets of data can be combined for statistical processing.If the two were statistically significant, they were processed separately.TABLE 7 | Comparison of vitamin A levels between different seasons at age ≤ 1 year.

The comparison between vitamin concentrations in the four age groups showed a statisti - cal significance of p < 0.05 (Tables 3 and 4). As age increased, the levels of VA and VE did not simply increase or decrease in the four age groups, and VA and VE levels show periodic changes (Figures 1 and 2 ).3.2 | Correlation Between Serum VA and VE Concentrations and Seasons In general, VA levels were compared in different seasons, and the concentration levels in other seasons had statistical signif - icance except in summer–autumn ( p > 0.05; Table 5), and the TABLE 11 | Comparison of vitamin A levels between different seasons at 1< age ≤ 6 years.

3.5 | Simple Verification of Reference Range of VA and VE The detection results of VA and VE in 80 selected cases from the four age groups were all within the reference interval of the corresponding age group. Given that the verified results were all distributed within the corresponding reference interval, the reference interval established in this study has practical signifi - cance and can be used and promoted in clinical practice.4 | Discussion As an essential nutrient for maintaining normal metabolism and function of the body, fat- soluble vitamins play an important role in growth, development, immune regulation, and other as - pects [ 12– 15 ].Vitamin A, also known as retinol, is a fat- soluble vitamin [ 6].It has extensive regulatory effects on body growth and devel - opment, cell proliferation and differentiation, and immune function [ 16– 19 ].
Its deficiency can increase the incidence of recurrent respiratory tract infection (RRTIs) in children, lead to a decrease in the diversity of the human gut microbiome, in - directly increase the susceptibility to gastrointestinal infection or injury [ 20–23 ], and can also lead to salivary gland atrophy. It can cause hypofunction of salivary glands and reduce the oral defense ability against infection and the buffering ability of plaque acid [ 24–30 ].The intake of VA only marginally above the recommended amount is associated with embryopathy, re - duced bone mineral density in the neonate, and increased risk for hip fracture [ 31, 32 ].Vitamin E is the general name of 4 tocopherols and 4 tocotrienols found in food [ 33–35 ], which is known for its antioxidant activity, is essential for growth and development, and is closely related to immune function [ 36–38 ].TABLE 40 | Comparison of vitamin A levels between males and females in spring at 7< age ≤ 59 years.

An excessive intake of VE will resist the effect of vitamin K, resulting in bleeding, platelet generation, and aggregation and thus thrombosis [ 41].
To date, thresholds for vitamin deficiency in the general popu - lation have been established on the basis of different nutritional status and recommendations from WHO [ 8, 42 ]. The research - ers believe that the threshold for vitamin deficiency should be specific within population subgroups and that it is not appro - priate to have only one threshold for vitamin deficiency in all populations.Vitamin levels can vary depending on age, genet - ics, inflammation, and pregnancy [ 43].Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to establish VA and VE reference intervals suitable for different populations in different regions to evaluate the vitamin levels of corresponding populations, to make rea - sonable treatment procedures for clinicians.
In this study, the serum concentration levels in VA and VE from infants to adults in Southern Sichuan, China, were measured and divided into four different age groups from age ≤ 1 year (3541 cases), 1< to ≤ 6 years (1456 cases), 6< to ≤ 17 years (404 cases), and 17< to ≤ 59 years (4081 cases). The results showed that the distribution of VA and VE in different age groups was skewed, and there were significant differences, indicating that VA and VE levels were correlated with age and that the VA concentra - tion level was positively correlated with age.The concentration level of VE was negatively correlated with age.VA and VE are fat- soluble vitamins, and their content level can be determined on the basis of the geographical location of the population, sun - shine conditions, and living habits.
The results of this study showed that the levels of VA and VE were lower in summer and autumn than in spring and winter, which may be due to the ac - celerated loss of VA and VE in summer and autumn. Therefore, for these two seasons, vitamin supplementation should be ap - propriate.However, the VE concentration level is related to gen - der, and the level of men is lower than that of women.5 | Conclusion In summary, age, season, and gender are closely related because of VA and VE content.Therefore, it is necessary to establish a reference interval suitable for the local population in the north - ern and southern regions of Sichuan, to provide a scientific basis for the clinical prevention and diagnosis of VA and VE defi - ciency and formulate safe and reasonable treatment measures to avoid deficiency or excess.Author Contributions Qiang Zhong was involved in conception and design.
