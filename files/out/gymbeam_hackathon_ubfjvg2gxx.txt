Cronobacter is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen found widespread in the envi- ronment; it is an important foodborne pathogen that can infect humans and cause life- threatening infections, such as meningitis, septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis (1). It is a high risk to infants fed contaminated formula with a fatality rate of ;27% (2) and has attracted public attention (3).Its recovery from various low-moisture foods, such as infant formula,including cereals, nuts, peanut and nut butter, chocolate, spices, and fresh vegetables, hasbeen documented (4 –7).In addition, con ﬁrmed Cronobacter isolates from a ground beef- based ready-to-eat dish called Kitfo (8) was sequenced and analyzed to expand our knowledgeabout these pathogens.The Kitfo samples enriched in tryptic soy broth overnight at 32°C were plated into R&F (Enterobacter sakazakii ) chromogenic plating medium at 32°C for 24 h (9).
The isolate with a blue-black presumptive colony morphology was puri ﬁed several times by plating a single colony. Finally, the isolate was con ﬁrmed using a Vitek 2 system (bioMérieux) (10).Subsequently, the overnight culture kept at 32°C in tryptic soy broth was used for DNAextraction using the Wizard genomic DNA kit (Promega, Madison, WI).Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) libraries were constructed using the Nextera XT DNA sample prepara- tion kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA).The bacterial genome was sequenced using the MiSeqplatform (Illumina) using a 250-bp paired-end read v2 kit.The identi ﬁcation was further veriﬁed using WGS.All bioinformatics analyses were performed using the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) v3.6.12 platform (11).FastQC v0.11.7 (12) con ﬁrmed that the fastq ﬁles were good quality with 1,649,960 total reads.The PATRIC Comprehensive G e n o m eA n a l y s i sS e r v i c eu s e dS P A d e sf o rt h e de novo assembly of the reads (13).
Default parameters were used for all software unless otherwise speci ﬁed. The assembly produced 39 contigs with coverage of 183 /C2and L 50and N50values of 4 and 481,817 bp, respectively.The draft genome of C.sakazakii H05 revealed 4,495,386 bp with an average G 1C content of 56.85%.Genome annotation was performed with NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).The genome had a total of 4,175 protein-coding sequences (CDS), 74 tRNA gene sequences, 3 rRNA genes, and 123 CRISPR direct repeat arrays with 119 spacers.The genome annotation showed the presence of ef ﬂux pumps, such as AcrAB-TolC, AcrAD- TolC, and AcrEF-TolC.It also contained antibiotic resistance genes, such as FosA,marA ,marB ,Editor David Rasko, University of Maryland School of Medicine Copyright © 2022 Eshetea et al.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license .
