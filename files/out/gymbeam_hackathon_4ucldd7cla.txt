These food-borne pathogens are often found inretail raw meats; however, the type and amount of existent pathogensdiffers depending on the type of meat (2). Chicken meat, in particular,is highly susceptible to cross-contamination by enteric pathogensthat can cause food-borne illness, such as Salmonella a n d Listeria , during slaughter (3).Zhao et al .(2) reported that 38.7 and 4.2% of 212 retail chicken samples were contaminated by Escherichia coli and Salmonella, respectively .In the case of Listeria, the prevalence was 26% (23 of 89 chicken meat samples) (4).Therefore, inactivationof pathogens present in chicken meat is essential for safe consumption.Plasma, which is an ionized gas or the fourth state of matter, is generated by the interaction between electromagnetic fields andgas, especially, when the field is sufficiently strong (5).Plasmatechnology has been studied as a non-thermal sterilization methodfor improving food safety.
The effect of this technology is significantsince, unlike thermal sterilization, it does not cause nutritional and quality changes (6,7); in addition, it is more cost-effective and easy toinstall compared with other non-thermal sterilization technologiessuch as gamma irradiation, electron-beam, and high pressure (8,9).Inactivation of pathogens during plasma discharge is achieved byseveral factors including the electric field, UV photons, chargedparticles, and reactive species such as O, O 3, OH, H 2O 2, NO, or NO 2 (10-12). A number of studies have established the antimicrobialeffect of plasma on meat and meat products (9,13,14).Secondary contamination due to processing conditions (staff or equipment) is an unavoidable problem in slaughterhouses (15).Therefore, sanitation following packaging is required in order toprevent secondary contamination (16) and quality deterioration; thisis thought to be one of the greatest advantages of irradiation or high-pressure treatment.
For this reason, researchers have attempted todevelop a type of plasma sealed in a bottle (17), container (16,18), orpackage (6,19). A recent study by Jayasena et al .(6) demonstrated the effect of a sealed package with flexible thin-layer dielectricReceived January 19, 2016 Revised May 24, 2016 Accepted June 1, 2016Published online August 31, 2016 *Corresponding Author Tel: +82-2-880-4804 Fax: +82-2-873-2271 E-mail: cheorun@snu.ac.kr pISSN 1226-7708 eISSN 2092-6456 © KoSFoST and Springer 2016Abstract The microbiological safety, quality changes, and genotoxicity of chicken breasts treated with flexible thin-layer dielectric barrier discharge (FTDBD) plasma inside a sealed package wereinvestigated.Following 10 min plasma treatment, the numbers of total aerobic bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella Typhimurium were reduced by 3.36, 2.14, 2.73, and 2.71 Log CFU/g, respectively.
Color L* and b* values increased whereas a* value decreased followingplasma treatment with increasing exposure duration. Lipid oxidation was unaffected by plasma treatment.In sensory evaluation, flavor decreased and off-flavor increased with extended plasma exposure time, however, these changes had no effect on acceptability.Increased cohesiveness was theonly texture profile analysis parameter that changed following plasma treatment.No genotoxicity was detected in plasma-treated chicken breast using the Salmonella mutagenicity assay.Therefore, FTDBD plasma is applicable since it is able to improve microbiological safety with minimal changes in sensoryproperties of the chicken breast.Keywords: chicken breast, plasma, quality, safety, genotoxicity 1190 Lee et al.Food Sci.Biotechnol.barrier discharge (FTDBD) plasma on pork butt and beef loin, thus establishing an option for using the FTDBD plasma system.
Bacterial inactivation effect of plasma has been tested on chicken meat but following quality changes has not been investigated yet(3,9,13). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate theinactivation effect of FTDBD plasma on chicken breasts, generatedwithin a sealed package, and observe changes in quality and thegenotoxicological safety using the Salmonella mutagenicity assay following different durations of plasma exposure.Materials and Methods Sample preparation and sterilization Raw chicken breasts were purchased from a local market in Seoul, Korea and divided into twosections.One section was cut to the same size (25×25×7 mm) andvacuum-packaged.Then, the chicken breast samples were sterilizedfor inoculation testing with irradiation (35 kGy) using a linearelectron-beam RF accelerator (10 MeV, 40 kW; EB Tech, Daejeon,Korea).
The other section of chicken breast was treated with DBDplasma directly without sterilization step and used to determine thenumber of total aerobic bacteria, physicochemical properties andtoxicological safety. Treatment with FTDBD plasma A flexible package system which is designed for generating DBD plasma within the package was preparedusing the conductive layer of a commercial, zippered food package(129×199 mm) as the powered electrode (6).While the innerpatterned electrode was grounded, a bipolar square-waveformvoltage of 15 kHz was applied to the outer electrode.Plasma wasgenerated at the surface of the inner electrode at 100 W peak powerand 2 W average power.As an operating gas, the atmospheric air wasused.After the DBD plasma treatment, the respective samples were used for microbial analysis and instrumental color measurementimmediately.
The other samples were stored under at 4 oC until the following day and analysis of other physicochemical properties,sensory parameters, and toxicological safety. Microbial analysis In order to analysis the total aerobic bacteria, chicken sample (5 g) was mixed with 45 mL of sterile saline solution(0.85%) using a stomacher BagMixer ® 400 (Interscience Co., Saint Nom, France).Then, the samples were decimally diluted using sterilesaline solution.Total plate count agar (Difco Laboratories, FranklinLakes, NJ, USA) was prepared for counting the total number ofaerobic microbes.The plates were incubated at 37 oC for 48 h.All colonies were counted and the number of microorganisms wasexpressed as Log CFU/g.Inoculation test Escherichia coli O157:H7 (KCCM 40406), Salmonella Typhimurium (KCTC 1925), and Listeria monocytogenes (KCTC 3569)were cultivated in tryptic soy broth (TSB), nutrient broth, and TSB containing 0.6% yeast extract, respectively (Difco Laboratories), at37 oC for 48 h.
Then, the cultures were centrifuged (2,265x g f or 15 min) in a refrigerated centrifuge (UNION 32R; Hanil Science Industrial Co. Ltd., Incheon, Korea).The obtained pellets were washed twicewith sterile saline solution (0.85%) and suspended in sterile salinesolution to achieve a viable cell density of approximately 10 8-109 CFU/mL.The irradiation-sterilized chicken breast samples wereremoved from the packages and inoculated with the 100 µL of test- culture suspensions.Subsequent to spreading the suspensions onthe chicken breasts, the meat samples were kept under sterileconditions at room temperature for 10 min to enable attachment ofthe microorganisms to the samples.After plasma treatment, inoculated samples were blended with 45 mL of sterile saline as described above.Decimal dilutions wereprepared with the sterile saline solution.The media used for therecording the growth of E.coli O157:H7, L.monocytogenes , and S.
Typhimurium were typtic soy agar (TSA; Difco Laboratories), TSAcontaining 0.6% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories), and nutrient agar(Difco Laboratories), respectively. Incubation of plates and colonycounting were done as explained above.Instrumental color measurement The color of plasma-treated and untreated chicken breast samples were measured by a colorimeter(Spectrophotometer, CM-3500d; Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Osaka,Japan) using CIE L*-, a*, and b*-value.The instrument was calibratedwith a standard white and black plate before analysis.The colorv a l u e s w e r e m o n i t o r e d u s i n g a c o m p u t e r i z e d s ys t e m c o n t r o l l e d b ySpectra Magic software (Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc.).Measurement of 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) Each chicken breast sample (3 g) was homogenized (Ika LaboratoryEquipment, Staufen im Breisgau, Germany) with 9 mL of distilledwater and 50 µL of 7.2% butylated hydroxytoluene (in ethanol).
Then the homogenate (1 mL) was transferred to a 15-mL test tube andmixed with 2 mL of a thiobarbituric acid (20 mmol/L)/trichloroaceticacid (15%) solution. Next, the test tubes were heated in a 90 oC water bath for 30 min, cooled in cold water, and centrifuged (Hanil ScienceIndustrial Co.Ltd.) at 2,090× g for 10 min.A spectrophotometer (DU 530; Beckman Instruments Inc., Brea, CA, USA) was used to measurethe absorbance of the supernatant at 532 nm.The TBARS value (mgmalondialdehyde/kg sample) was calculated using a standard curve.Texture analysis Plasma treated and untreated chicken breasts were minced and separately prepared (4 cm in diameter x2 cmthickness; approximately 20 g), then cooked to reach an internaltemperature of 75 oC.Texture of sample was measured by a texture analyzer (TA-XT Plus; Stable Micro Systems Ltd., Surrey, UK) bycompressing the centers of the cooked meat samples.
A probe (75mm in diameter) was compressed twice to 75% of their originalheight at a test speed of 2.00 mm/s and a trigger force of 50 g. The Chicken breast treated by flexible DBD plasma 1191 August 2016 | Vol.25 | No.4Exponent Lite Texture Analysis software (Stable Micro System Ltd.) was used for texture analysis; hardness, adhesiveness, springiness,cohesiveness, gumminess, and chewiness were recorded.In eachtreatment combination, three replicate samples were measured.Sensory evaluation FTDBD plasma-treated and untreated chicken breasts were cut into sections (25×25×7 mm) and cooked on anelectric grill featuring double heating surfaces (1,400 W, NovaEMG-533; Evergreen Enterprise, Yongin, Korea) until the internal temperatureof sample reached 72 oC.The temperature of the center of meat sample was monitored by a digital thermometer (YF-160A, Type-K;YFE, Hsinchu, Taiwan).For evaluation, the samples were transferredin randomly coded white dishes and served together with drinkingwater.
Eight semi-trained panelists who have had at least 1 year ofexperience in sensory analysis of meat treated with non-thermalprocessing, evaluated the cooked samples for color, appearance,taste, off-flavor, and overall acceptability by a 9-point hedonic scale(from extreme dislike=1 to extreme like=9). The sensory evaluationwas run three times independently for replicated study.Mutagenicity assay The mutagenicity assay was conducted with ethanolic extracts of plasma-treated sample for 0 and 10 min.A totalof 100 g of each extract was transferred into 900 mL of 70% (v/v)ethanol.The extracts incubated for 8 h at room temperature werefiltered by Whatman filter paper No.4 (Whatman International Ltd.,Kent, England).Then, 70% ethanol (900 mL) was added again and theprocedure was repeated.Ethanol was removed from the samplesusing a rotary vacuum evaporator (Rotary Vacuum Evaporator N-11Eyela; Tokyo Rikakikai Co.Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
The extracts were dried(Freeze dry system, FreeZone 18; Labconco Corp., Kansas City, MO,USA,) following freezing and kept at −70 oC before use. The Salmonella m u t a g e n i c i t y a s s a y ( A m e s t e s t ) w a s c o n d u c t e d according to the methods of Ames et al .(20) and Maron and Ames (21).S.Typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 were provided by the Korea Institute of Toxicology (KIT, Daejeon, Korea).The strains werepurchased from Molecular Toxicology Inc.originally (Boone, NC,USA) and cultured by the KIT in the Korea Research Institute ofC h e m i c a l T e c h n o l o g y ( K R I C T , D a e j e o n , U S A ) .E a c h s t r a i n w a s f i r s ttested for its genetic traits including histidine requirement, deeprough ( rfa) characteristic, UV sensitivity ( uvrB mutation), and ampicillin or tetracycline-resistance by R-factor prior to use.Thestrains were inoculated on nutrient broth No.
2 (Oxoid Co., Ltd.,Hampshire, England) and cultured at 37 oC for 10 h at 200 rpm (Vision Scientific Co., Incheon, Korea) to a cell density of 2 × 109 CFU/mL. The tested sample doses were 1,250, 2,500, and 5,000 µg sample per plate.S9 mix was obtained from the Oriental Yeast Co.Ltd.(Lot No.0042101; Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan); 5% S9 mix wasprepared using the S9 mix fraction and a cofactor (Lot No.999902;Wako Co., Tokyo, Japan).Treatment concentration was 500 µL/plate.The positive controls included 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO,Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA), 2-Aminoanthracene (2-AA, Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in deionized distilled water (DDW) ordimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium azide (SA, Sigma-Aldrich).
Two plates per concentration were used for the direct plateincorporation method; 100 µL of sample combined with 100 µL of bacterial culture (2×10 9 CFU/mL) and 500 µL of the S9 mixture were added to 2 mL of warm top agar (approximately 45oC) containing 0.5 mM histidine-biotin. This mixture was poured onto a minimalglucose agar plate and allowed to solidify.The plates were incubatedfor 48 h at 37 oC and then the number of revertant colonies was enumerated.The negative control was 100 µL of ethanol.The positive control was 4-NQO and SA (100 µL each) when metabolic activation was not incorporated and 2-AA (100 µL) when metabolic activation was incorporated.Mutagenicity was determined using the methodof Maron and Ames (21) stating that if the number of revertantcolonies in a sample is greater than double that in the negativecontrol and it demonstrates a dose-dependent response, it meansstatistically significant and considered as positive for mutagenicity.
Statistical analysis Each set of data represents the mean of three replications. One-way analysis of variance was performed with acompletely randomized design using the procedure of General LinearModel.Significant differences among mean values were determinedusing Duncan's multiple comparison test in SAS Release 9.2.(SASInstitute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) with the confidence level of p<0.05.Mean values and standard errors of the mean are reported.Allexperimental procedures were conducted in triplicate with twoobservation numbers except for sensory analysis.Results and Discussion Inactivation of foodborne pathogens The antibacterial effect of plasma treatment on chicken breasts has been previously demonstrated(3,9,13), although these studies used different types of plasmasystems.Jayasena et al.(6) inoculated pork butt and beef loin with L.monocytogenes , E.coli O157:H7, and S.Typhimurium and treated the meat for 10 min with FTDBD plasma.
The number of thesepathogens were reduced by 2.04, 2.54, and 2.68 Log CFU/g,respectively, in pork butt samples and by 1.98, 2.57, and 2.58 LogCFU/g, respectively, in beef loin following plasma treatment for 10min. The pathogen reduction rate was higher (3.20, 2.10, and 5.80Log CFU/g, respectively) in sliced cheddar cheese (22).Similar tothese previous studies, the results of the current study demonstratethat the number of total aerobic bacteria (Fig.1) and inoculatedpathogens (Table 1) in the chicken breast samples was clearlyreduced by FTDBD plasma.No viable aerobic bacterial cells weredetected following 10 min plasma treatment (Fig.1).As shown inTable 1, the populations of the three pathogens in the chicken breastsamples decreased with increasing treatment duration ( p<0.05); the log-reduction of L.monocytogenes , E.coli O157:H7, and S.Typhimurium 1192 Lee et al.Food Sci.
Biotechnol.was 2.14, 2.73, and 2.71 Log CFU/g, respectively, quite similar to the values obtained for other previously tested foods (6,9). Several plasma agents are generated when plasma is discharged that contribute to the inactivation of microorganisms, includingelectric field, UV photons, charged particles, and reactive species.However, electric field and UV are not major factors in plasmasterilization.Ma et al .(23) investigated the effect of electric field on Staphylococcus aureus and E.coli using a stepwise 60 s application of voltage (0-12 kV) until critical voltage was reached (critical voltage; ifvoltage exceeds the critical point, the influence of the electric fieldsignificantly decreased) (24); however, no significant differenceswere detected in the inactivation results.UV irradiation is known totrigger the formation of thymine dimers in nucleic acids and caninhibit microorganism growth (11).According to Guo et al .
(11), the bactericidal effect of UV generated by plasma alters depending ongas and discharge type. UV has a significant effect only when argonor an oxygen/nitrogen mixture gas is used as the operating gas orwhen microwave-driven discharge is utilized.When sufficient chargedparticles accumulate on the surface of microorganisms, they are ableto form an electric field and thus alter protein structure This changein protein structure results in the creation of pores in the membraneof microorganisms or inhibition of enzymatic activities (11).Ma et al.(23) demonstrated cytoplasm leakage via pores generated byplasma-induced agents by detecting K +, proteins, and nucleic acids.Reactive species have considered play a crucial role in the inactivationof microorganisms (6,12,18,23,25).Joshi et al .(26) reported that reactive species generated by plasma cause oxidative DNA damageand membrane lipid peroxidation.
Surface color The L* (Lightness), a* (redness), b* (yellowness) values of plasma-treated chicken breasts were significantly differentcompared with the untreated samples ( p<0.05) (Table 2). Subsequent to FTDBD plasma treatment, the L* and b* values of the chickenbreasts increased with increasing treatment time ( p<0.05).In contrast, the a* value was significantly decreased by plasmatreatment compared with untreated chicken breasts ( p<0.05).Jayasena et al .(6) reported decreased a* values and increased b* values in beef loins treated with FTDBD plasma.A decrease in a*value was also detected in pork butt samples.Another study alsoreported that plasma-treated pork ( Musculus longissimus dorsi ) presented decreased a* values and increased b* value (17).Greenishcolor of meat can be related with formation of sulfmyoglobin,choleglobin, and verdohaem (27).If hydrogen sulfide and oxygenreact with myoglobin, sulfmyoglobin can be formed (17).
Oxidizedporphyrin ring develops green color by forming choleglobin andverdohaem (27). Fröhling et al .(17) demonstrated that the green color in plasma-treated meat sample is likely to be formed byhydrogen peroxide which is generated during plasma treatment.TBARS values TBARS values are indicative of the level of lipid oxidation, which is a complex mechanism between unsaturated fattyacids and oxygen molecules (28) resulting in extensive quality Fig.1.Effect of flexible thin-layer dielectric barrier discharge plasma on inactivation of total aerobic bacteria in chicken breasts.a - dDifferent letters among the treatments differ significantly ( p<0.05).Table 1.Pathogen counts (Log CFU/g) in inoculated chicken breast samples following treatment with flexible thin-layer dielectric barrierdischarge plasma for different time Time (min)Pathogens (Log CFU/g) Listeria monocytogenesEscherichia coli O157:H7Salmonella Typhimurium 0 5 .8 8 a2)5.84a5.48a 2.5 5.34b4.68b4.17b 54 .

(8) obtained similar results for bacon samples treated with atmospheric pressure plasmausing helium and helium/oxygen as carrier gases. However, Jayasenaet al .(6) reported that lipid oxidation was accelerated by FTDBD plasma in pork butt and beef loin samples.Thus, TBARS values might be influenced by plasma treatment conditions including plasma type,carrier gas, and sample characteristics such as fat content andcomposition.TBARS value can be increased by an increase of fatcontent (30).Chicken breast has a lower total fat content (%) thanbeef or pork ( longissimus dorsi and semimembranosus muscles) (31).In addition, the ferric heme pigment is considered to be a critical pro-oxidant in tissue (29) and TBARS values closely correlate with totalpigment and myoglobin content (32).Chicken breast has lower hemeiron content, pigment, and the ultimate metmyoglobin levelscompared with pork and beef (32).
Texture Cohesiveness was the only texture analysis parameter affected in plasma-treated chicken breasts (Table 3). The level ofcohesiveness increased with plasma exposure time ( p<0.05).Using FTDBD plasma to inactivate microorganisms did not result insignificant changes in any of the texture parameters of the pork buttand beef loin samples (6).There was no major effect on texture byplasma treatment.Irradiation, which is one of the nonthermalsterilization methods, have similarity.Since superoxide radicals,hydrogen peroxide, and singlet molecular oxygen act as main factorsin bacterial inactivation (33).Irradiation treatment also have notsignificant effect on texture in turkey breast roll (34).Sensory evaluation To investigate the effect of FTDBD plasma on chicken breast, sensory evaluation was conducted (Table 4).Plasmatreatment did not affect most sensory parameters evaluated exceptfor flavor.
Flavor score was slightly lower and the off-flavor score washigher when plasma exposure time was increased ( p<0.05). Lipid and protein oxidation caused by radicals produce secondary oxidation products such as aldehydes, alkanes, alkenes, hydrocarbons,ketones, alcohols, esters, and acids (7) several of these oxidationproducts have unique aromas that can influence the flavor of theoriginal sample (28).Yong et al.(22) reported FTDBD plasma treatment of sliced cheddar cheese resulted in lower scores in flavor scores andhigher off-flavor scores due to lipid oxidation.However, the change inflavor and off-flavor in the present study are most likely not causedby lipid oxidation since there were no significant changes in theTBARS values following plasma treatment.In addition, there were nochanges in off-flavor in FTDBD treated pork butt and beef loinsamples, although lipid oxidation was observed (6).
Therefore,further studies are required to elucidate the factors that cause off-flavor in plasma treated chicken. Mutagenicity assay The results presented in Table 5 indicate that 10 min plasma treatment at doses of up to 5,000 µg/plate did not affect mutagenicity.Maron and Ames (21) determined that when thenumber of revertant colonies is greater than that in the negativecontrol, the sample is positive for mutagenicity.The number ofrevertant colonies in our positive control was 20 and 3-fold higherthan our experimental samples with the TA98 and TA100 strains,Table 3.

From the results, our results indicate that FTDBD plasma can be applicable because of its ability to improve microbiological safetywith minimal changes in the sensory properties of chicken breast.Acknowledgment This work was supported by R&D Program of Plasma Advanced Technology for Agriculture and Food (PlasmaFarming; Project No.En1425-1) through the National FusionResearch Institute of Korea (NFRI) funded by government funds andInstitute of Green Bio Science and Technology, Seoul NationalUniversity.Disclosure The authors declare no conflict of interest.References 1.Scallan E, Hoekstra RM, Angulo FJ, Tauxe RV, Widdowson M-A, Roy SL, Jones JL, Griffin PM.Foodborne illness acquired in the United States-major pathogens.Emerg.Infect.Dis.17: 7-15 (2011) 2.Zhao C, Ge B, De Villena J, Sudler R, Yeh E, Zhao S, White D G, Wagner D, Meng J.
