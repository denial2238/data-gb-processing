We aimed to estimate the effect of iron supplement use on mortality, disease progression and haematological outcomes among HIV-infected chil- dren in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among HIV-infected children (aged 0–14 years) receiving antiretroviral treatment or supportive care between October 2004and September 2014.Clinical data were recorded on morbidity and vital status, haemato-logical status and prescriptions at each clinical visit.Cox proportional hazards models ad- justed for time-varying covariates were used to estimate the association of time-varying iron supplementation on the hazard rate of mortality, HIV disease stage progression, tu-berculosis incidence and anaemia and microcytosis persistence.Results: In all, 4229 children were observed during 149 260 clinic visits for a mean follow- up of 2.9 years.
After adjustment for time-varying clinical covariates, time-varying iron supplementation was associated with a 2.87 times higher hazard rate of mortality (95% VCThe Author(s) 2022; all rights reserved.

Conclusions: Iron supplementation may increase the risk of HIV disease stage progres- sion and mortality among HIV-infected children, while reducing the risk of anaemia. Key words: HIV, children, iron, cohort, mortality, antiretroviral therapy Introduction Iron deficiency and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are each an important contributor to morbidity and mortality among children in low- and middle-income countries.Iron deficiency is thought to be responsible for25–50% of the 273 million cases of anaemia among chil-dren aged 6–59 months in the year 2011, making it among the most common causes of disability in this age group.1–4 To address this challenge, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends daily oral iron supplementation forall children 6 months to 12 years of age in regions with aprevalence of anaemia >40% and adequate malaria con- trol.5With respect to HIV, 1.7 million children <15 years were estimated to be living with an HIV infection in theyear 2018.
6Although immediate initiation of anti- retroviral therapy (ART) is now recommended for all chil-dren diagnosed with HIV, only slightly more than half of children receive treatment. 7,8A meta-analysis estimated that 34% of HIV-infected children are estimated to beiron-deficient (though this may be an underestimate, assome iron status biomarkers were not corrected for inflam-mation) and iron supplementation is sometimes given in conjunction with ART.9 However, the safety of iron supplementation among HIV-infected children is called into question by evidence from molecular biology which indicates that iron facilitates HIV replication and the virulence of opportunistic patho-gens.Reverse transcription of HIV RNA, transcription ofHIV genes, and assembly of HIV capsid proteins are iron- dependent or iron-regulated processes.
10In vitro studies have suggested that these processes are sensitive to changesin iron availability, with viral replication increasing withthe addition of cellular iron and decreasing with iron chela-tion. 11–14Furthermore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis— the most common cause of death among AIDS patients—com-petes for iron stores within host macrophages, and down-regulation of macrophage iron uptake is thought to be partof innate immune defence.15 A large, long-term observational cohort study of HIV- infected adults initiating antiretroviral therapy in Tanzania(n¼40 657) between the years 2004 and 2012 found a starkly increased rate of mortality among those who wereprescribed iron-folic acid supplements.The risk of mortal-ity associated with iron supplement use was higher among patients with no anaemia (HR ¼3.8) than those with se- vere anaemia (HR ¼1.6).
16These findings raise the ques- tion of whether similar risks are apparent for children, asthe symptoms and treatment of HIV infection among chil-dren differ substantially from those of adults. 17 Additionally, iron supplements are more widely recom-mended for children than adults.5 Two prior studies of iron supplementation among HIV- infected children were done in small populations over shortperiods of follow-up and do not examine mortality as anoutcome.18,19The present study aims to address these gaps.We present a longitudinal cohort study of HIV-infected Tanzanian children who received supportive careKey Messages •This is the largest study to date on the subject of iron supplementation among HIV-infected children, and the ﬁrst to investigate mortality outcomes.
•After control for time-varying clinical covariates, the hazard rate of mortality associated with iron supplementationwas 2.87 (95% CI: 1.70, 4.87) times higher than for children not receiving iron supplementation; these results did notdiffer according to antiretroviral therapy use or anaemia status. •Clinicians, particularly in contexts where anaemia is presumptively treated with iron supplementation, may use theﬁndings of this study to consider the relative risks and beneﬁts of prescribing iron to HIV-infected children.1534 International Journal of Epidemiology , 2022, Vol.51, No.5 or antiretroviral therapy over 2004–2012.We aim to esti- mate the effect of iron supplement use on disease progres-sion and haematological outcomes, as well as potentialeffect modification by antiretroviral therapy.Methods Study population A prospective cohort study was prepared using medical re-cord data from HIV-infected children aged 0–14 years inDar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Data on patient visits were avail-able from October 2004 to September 2014. Study partici-pants were enrolled in supportive care and antiretroviral treatment services at Management and Development for Health (MDH), an HIV care provider supported by theU.S.President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.Patientsreceived treatment free of charge.The start of follow-upfor this study was defined as the date that HIV-infected children had their first clinical visit at an MDH facility.Clinical care and data collection Patients were scheduled for monthly visits with a physician where they received regular evaluations, were givencounselling on nutrition and ART adherence, and obtainedART refills.When patients missed a visit or had abnormal laboratory results, they were contacted in person or by phone to encourage them to return to the clinic.A team ofcommunity health workers and volunteers worked withthe treatment clinics to trace and ascertain the vital statusof individuals lost to follow-up.
Blood specimens were scheduled to be drawn every 4 months by trained phlebotomists. Haemoglobin and meancorpuscular volume (MCV; using ACT5 Diff haematologyanalyzer; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) as well as CD4 cell counts or percent (using FACS Calibur; Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) were assessed.Children were eligible for in-clusion in the study from the time they had a blood speci-men with complete haemoglobin, MCV and CD4 data.Iron supplements (ferrous sulphate alone, ferrous sulphate plus folic acid, or ferrous sulphate-B12 complex) were pre- scribed by the physician on the basis of haemoglobin levelsor severe clinical pallor.In some cases, iron may have beenprescribed to non-anaemic children based on clinical indi-cations in the absence of a recent haemoglobin assay, or inorder to replenish iron stores following the resolution of anaemia.Iron supplement prescriptions were typically for a course of 1-2 months.
The amount of elemental iron con-tained in the supplements, according to the age of thechild, is listed in Supplementary Table S1 , available as Supplementary data atIJEonline. No monitoring ofadherence to supplementation was performed in this rou- tine clinical context.The presence of active pulmonary tuberculosis was assessed via chest X-ray and sputum smear for acid-fast ba-cilli at the first visit and subsequently if suggestive symp- toms appeared.HIV disease stage progression (stage I-IV, defined based on clinical symptoms) was assessed usingWHO criteria.20Viral load testing was not routinely per- formed in this clinical setting.Antiretroviral care was pro- vided per the Tanzania National Guidelines for the Management of HIV and AIDS, which changed three timesover the course of the study.
21–24Antiretroviral therapy consisted of three drugs: two nucleoside reverse transcrip- tase inhibitors (zidovudine, lamivudine, abacavir, stavu-dine) plus one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptaseinhibitor (nevirapine, efavirenz). Stavudine replaced zido- vudine in cases of anaemia, and efavirenz replaced nevira- pine in the case of rifampin-based tuberculosis treatment.Nurses and physicians collected clinical data on stan- dard case report forms using unique patient identifiers.Data reviewers at each clinic ensured completeness of records and conducted quality assurance checks before en- tering data into a secure computerized database.Variable definitions Exposure to iron supplements was defined as a patient hav- ing been prescribed iron alone, iron plus folic acid, or iron- B12 complex.For the main analysis, the iron exposure pe-riod was considered to continue for 3 months from the date of prescription.
Sensitivity analyses were performed by alternatively defining the exposure period to be6 months, until the end of follow-up and until the next visitdate. Time to mortality was defined as the number of days from the time of exposure status (i.e.either receiving or not receiving iron supplements) to the date of death as con- firmed by clinical records.Other time-to-event outcomesincluded diagnosis of incident tuberculosis, HIV disease stage progression, anaemia persistence and microcytosis persistence.Incident tuberculosis was defined as the ab-sence of tuberculosis at or prior to the start of follow-upfollowed by a tuberculosis diagnosis during follow-up.HIV disease stage progression was defined as an increase of at least one stage from the one recorded at the start offollow-up.Categories of anaemia (none, mild, moderate and severe) were defined using age-specific haemoglobin cut-offs as per the WHO.
25As no WHO guidance exists for defining anaemia in children 0–5 months of age, the definitions for children aged 6–59 months were applied. Microcytosis (MCV <–2 standard deviations), a marker of iron deficiency, was defined using age-specific cut-offsInternational Journal of Epidemiology , 2022, Vol.51, No.5 1535 according to the WHO.26As a majority of children (82.9%) were anaemic at baseline, we examined the effect of iron supplementation on the probability of reduction in anaemia severity or microcytosis, defined as a change instatus to a less severe category than the one observed at thestart of follow-up (conversely, persistence was defined as alack of reduction in severity).Covariates were assessed at every clinical visit and car- ried forward in the case of missing data for a given visit.
Covariates included age (0–5 months, 6–23 months, 24–59 months, 5–11 years 12–14 years), sex, Tanzania HIVtreatment guideline under effect (1st edition April 2002—March 2005, 2nd edition April 2005—January 2009, 3rdedition February 2009—March 2012, 4th edition April2012—April 2015), body mass index for age z score(BMIz; BMIz >1, 1/C21BMIz/C21–1, –1 >BMIz/C21–2, BMIz <– 2), district of Dar es Salaam (Ilala, Kinondoni, Temeke), health facility type (hospital, health centre, dispensary),immune deficiency (as defined by CD4 count or percentper WHO criteria 20; none, mild, advanced, severe), HIV disease stage (I, II, III, IV) and ART status (on ART, noton ART). Statistical methods The data were structured in Andersen-Gill format, witheach row representing exposure, outcome, and covariatedata for a given patient on a given date of observation.27 Covariate values were carried forward until the next datewhen a new measurement was available.
Missing indica-tors were used when covariate values were not available. 28 Outlier values of haemoglobin and mean corpuscular vol-ume were defined according to Tukey’s criteria (using cut-offs that are a multiple of three times the interquartilerange below the first quartile or above the third quartile)and dropped from analysis.29Cox proportional hazards re- gression models with time-varying exposure and covariate data were used to estimate the association between ironsupplementation and time-to-event outcomes.Interactionterms were tested for time-varying ART status and anae-mia severity.Marginal structural models, which accountfor potential time-varying exposure and covariate feed-back, were used as a sensitivity analysis.30The degree of unmeasured confounding needed to explain the observed hazard ratios was calculated.31Two-sided statistical tests were used, with statistical significance defined as p <0.05.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata software(version 13, College Station, TX).Results There were 12 248 HIV-infected children, 0-14 years of age, who visited a study health centre between 2004 and 2014,for a total of 312 429 patient-visits ( Figure 1 ). Among these children, 7816 were excluded due to a lack of blood speci-mens that contained CD4, haemoglobin or MCV values.After these exclusions, there were an additional 203 patientsexcluded because they did not have any follow-up visits af-ter their first complete blood specimen.The final samplesize is 4229 children observed over 149 269 patient-visitsand a mean follow-up time of 2.90 years.The plurality of children (41.5%) began follow-up be- tween the ages of 5 and 11 years, with very few enrolled in the first 6 months of life (7.4%; Table 1 ).Approximately half of the study population was female (50.9%).
Anaemiawas observed in 82.9% of children and microcytosis in51.5% of children at the start of follow-up; 44.5% of chil-dren had both anaemia and microcytosis at the start offollow-up. However, only 64.1% of follow-up time wasamong children with anaemia and 39.1% among childrenwith microcytosis.Substantial improvements were seen forimmune status, with nearly half of children (44.9%)experiencing some degree of immunodeficiency at the startof follow-up, but only 5.5% of follow-up time spent withimmunodeficiency.The plurality of children were observedto have HIV disease stage 3 at both baseline and through-out follow-up.Nearly eight in 10 children (78.5%) wereon ART at some point during follow-up.The most com-mon drug regimen was lamivudine and nevirapine alongwith either stavudine or zidovudine.Iron supplementation was prescribed to 827 (19.6%) children ( Table 2 ).
Over half of children who received a pre- scription were prescribed iron only once; 23% of iron sup-plements were prescribed in the first 30 days of treatment;the median time until supplementation was 6.5 months. Ironsupplementation was more frequently prescribed to children Figure 1 Flowchart of exclusions from clinical database1536 International Journal of Epidemiology , 2022, Vol.51, No.

In a model examining the association be- tween time-varying iron supplementation adjusted for time-varying covariates, the rate of mortality was nearlythree times higher in children who were prescribed ironsupplements (HR ¼2.87; 95% CI: 1.70, 4.87). An asso- ciation of lesser magnitude was observed for iron sup-plementation and HIV disease stage progression(HR¼1.48; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.98).No association was seen between iron supplementation and incident tuber-culosis.Iron supplementation was also significantly as- sociated with reductions in anaemia (HR ¼0.47; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.61) but not with microcytosis (HR ¼0.63; 95% CI: 0.35, 1.15).The hazard rate of mortalityamong children not on ART (HR ¼3.04; 95% CI: 1.14, 8.10) did not differ from that among children on ART(HR¼2.83; 95% CI: 1.55, 5.15; Pfor hetero- geneity ¼0.90; Table 4 ) .S i m i l a rf i n d i n g sb yA R Ts t a t u s were seen for all other analysed outcomes.

5 were run specifying alternative effect periods. Models assuming immediate effects (i.e.effects within the next recorded clinical visit), 6-month periods and enduringeffects (i.e.from the time of supplementation to the end of follow-up) all found statistically significant and qualitatively similar associations of iron supplementa-tion with higher rates of mortality ( Supplementary Table S4 , available as Supplementary data atIJEon- line).A marginal structural model, which accounts for time-varying treatment and covariate feedback, foundsimilar estimates of elevated mortality associated with iron supplementation (HR ¼2.40; 95% CI: 1.35, 3.16).A model which excluded deaths that occurred within 2weeks of iron supplementation ( n¼13 out of 34 totaldeaths among children who received iron in the prior 3 months) found an attenuated but qualitatively similar association (HR ¼1.81; 95% CI: 0.98, 3.35).
We assessed the possibility whether unmeasured confounding may explain the observed increased haz- ard ratios for mortality. A 50% point disparity in prev-alence of an unmeasured confounder between the ironsupplemented and non-supplemented children, along with a hazard ratio between the confounder and mor- tality of three or more, would be needed to render theobserved hazard ratio between iron supplementation and mortality as statistically insignificant (Supplementary Table S5 , available as Supplementary data atIJEonline).

Prior studies, with smaller sam- ple sizes and shorter periods of follow-up, have not investi- gated the relationship between iron supplementation andmortality among HIV-infected children. Prior studies among adults have found mixed results.Two trials and one observational cohort suggest that HIV viral loads are not affected by iron supplementation.However, their small size, limited use of antiretroviraltherapy among participants and unique study populations prevent a strong generalized conclusion of no evidence for harm.The earliest of these studies randomized ART-naı ¨ve adults ( n¼32) in Kenya to twice-weekly parenteral iron (60 mg), and did not find a difference in the change in viral load over the 4-month intervention period.32Another study randomized HIV and hepatitis C co-infected female injection drug users in the USA ( n¼138) to micronutrients with iron (18 mg daily) versus micronutrients alone for12 months.CD4 counts and viral loads did not differ at theend of the study.
33The third study, among a cohort of anaemic pregnant women in Zambia ( n¼59), examined the influence of iron supplementation at 2 weeks postpar-tum on breast milk viral load. At 6 weeks postpartum there was no statistically significant difference in milk viral loads between those who used iron supplements and those whodid not.34However, a large study of adult patients (n¼40 657) receiving HIV care and treatment (conducted at the same facilities as for the children analysed in thisstudy) found an increased risk of mortality associated with iron supplements.16 Two small studies of iron supplementation among HIV- infected children provide some evidence among paediatric populations.One cohort study followed HIV-infectedIndian children aged 2–12 years for 12 months ( n¼194).The analysis compared children who were prescribed iron supplements with those who were not, and found that hae-moglobin, CD4% and HIV disease stage were similar after 1 year.
18However, the analysis did not control for any po- tentially confounding variables, making questionable anyclaims of causality with respect to iron supplementation. The strongest evidence comes from a trial in Malawi that randomized 209 HIV-infected children aged 6–59 monthswith moderate anaemia to 3 months of iron (3 mg/kg daily) plus multivitamins (vitamins A, C and D) versus multivita- mins alone.Approximately one-third of enrolled childrenwere receiving antiretroviral therapy at baseline.At the conclusion of the iron therapy period, iron-supplemented children had a decreased prevalence of anaemia and in-creased CD4%, but the incidence rate of malaria morethan doubled.19The present study followed a larger cohort of children for a longer period of time and assessed mortal- ity as an outcome.It is unclear from this study by what mechanism iron supplements would induce higher rates of mortality and HIV disease stage progression.
No association was foundbetween iron supplementation and incident tuberculosis, which suggests that this may not be the primary pathway. An alternative explanation is that impacts are mediated bychanges in viral load, which make the immune system sus- ceptible to a broad range of opportunistic infections, in- cluding not just tuberculosis but also Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, oesophageal candidiasis and recurrent bacte-rial infections.35Viral load data were not available for this study, but the increase in HIV disease stage associated with iron supplementation would support the viral load hypoth-esis.A final hypothesis is malaria infection, as iron supple- mentation is associated with an increased risk of clinical malaria in areas without effective malaria prevention andcontrol.
36Data on malaria infections were not available for study participants, but malaria is endemic at a low prevalence in Dar es Salaam (among children aged 6–59 months, 1.2% in 2007 and 3.6% in 2011), and there-fore may be a driver of increased mortality associated with iron supplementation. 37,38A sensitivity analysis which ex- cluded deaths that occurred within 2 weeks of iron supple-mentation found a somewhat attenuated association with mortality, which suggests that the biological mechanism may act more strongly soon after supplementation.Furtherresearch is needed to illuminate the potential aetiological pathway from iron supplementation to mortality among HIV-infected children.Improvements in anaemia were observed, with children receiving iron supplements being over twice as likely to im- prove their anaemia status.However, the haematologicalbenefits accrued to some children were not enough to re-sult in improved mortality outcomes in the iron-supple- mented group.
It is important to note there are not sufficient data available for this cohort to ascertain theaetiology of anaemia for participants. Other studies of hos- pitalized children in Tanzania have found that half or more of anaemia cases were not associated with iron defi-ciency.39,40It is likely that anaemia of inflammation is an important contributor, but this cannot be confirmed di- rectly.However, in our models of iron supplementation,1540 International Journal of Epidemiology , 2022, Vol.51, No.5 we included time-varying antiretroviral therapy as a covar- iate and found it was associated with a 49% reduction in the hazard of anaemia persistence.This suggests that in-flammation is an important cause of anaemia in the study population.Whether the effects of iron may differ depend- ing on anaemia aetiology is an important consideration forfuture research.
As with all observational research, there is a risk of re- sidual confounding by unmeasured determinants of iron supplementation and clinical outcomes. In this study, wehave controlled for a broad set of time-varying clinical indicators.These are the key clinical variables available to study clinicians which could be used for decision makingregarding the prescription of iron supplements, which sug- gests that important unmeasured confounding is unlikely.Even in the case that an important confounder was omittedfrom this analysis, sensitivity analyses show that only con- founders with a very strong association with mortality (HR/C213) and a large difference in prevalence between iron- supplemented and non-supplemented children (prevalencedifference >50%) would be sufficient to explain the ob- served associations.Another potential source of bias is in- accurate measurement of iron supplementation.This couldoccur if children were prescribed iron supplements but failed to consume them.
Iron supplementation trials among children have found that adherence to supplementation isoften above 80% in these study contexts. 41However, ad- herence may be lower in a routine clinical setting, such as the present study.If adherence were below 100%, then theestimated hazard ratios would be closer to the null, andtherefore an underestimate of the true effect of iron supplementation.Clinicians may use the findings of this study to consider the relative risks and benefits of prescribing iron to HIV- infected children.Given that this study found that there is an increased hazard of mortality and HIV disease stageprogression among anaemic children with HIV, even a ‘test and treat’ strategy of iron supplementation for anaemic children could pose risks.The findings are also relevant topublic health policies, such as the WHO’s current recom- mendation that iron supplements be provided to all chil- dren in areas with a high burden of anaemia.
Currently, acaveat is made in this guidance for malaria-endemicregions, and it may be prudent to consider a caveat for HIV-infected children as well. Evidence from one observa- tional study—even if strongly designed—is rarely a suffi-cient basis for changes in clinical or public health policy.Additional observational studies of iron supplementation in HIV-infected populations could include those receivingdifferent ART regimens and contexts with differing bur- dens of comorbidities and risk factors.Consideration should also be given to randomized trials that assess thesafety and efficacy of varying doses and timing of supple- mentation, although the requirement of equipoise may re-quire close scrutiny, given the risks observed in this study.Ethics approval Ethical approval for this study was granted by the institutional re- view boards of the Harvard T.H.

E-mail: hpssachdev@gmail.com Received 9 March 2022; Editorial decision 19 April 2022; Accepted 23 April 2022 Iron is a Janus-faced nutrient, presenting faces of protec- tion and of risk for those who are supplemented with it.One face is protective, preventing and curing iron- deficiency anaemia which is associated with physical and cognitive functional deficits and mortality risk in children.This has led to dedicated iron supplementation pro- grammes to address anaemia through improvements of iron status. The World Health Organization 1(WHO) rec- ommends universal daily iron supplementation for children 6 months to 12 years of age in regions with a prevalence ofanaemia >40% and adequate malaria control.This ‘push to push’ iron has expanded, as a variety of methods of im- proving iron intake, such as fortification of different staple foods, have been tried and occasionally layered on top of pharmacological supplementation, in an attempt to reduceanaemia prevalence rapidly.
2 The other face of iron, particularly as a supplemented nutrient, is one of potential adversity. Therefore, its admin-istration should be performed with precision, and not as a ‘one size fits the entire population’ approach.A dated sys- tematic review concluded that iron supplementation had no apparent harmful effect on the overall incidence of in- fectious illnesses in children, although it slightly increasedthe risk of developing diarrhoea.3Subsequently, a large study in Zanzibar found an increased risk of malaria- associated morbidity and mortality in iron-sufficient chil-dren receiving iron supplements, leading to the recognition that universal iron supplementation of children who werenot iron deficient could be harmful.4This marked the be- ginning of a policy shift towards safety and precision iniron supplementation programmes in areas with high ma- larial morbidity, wherein ‘adequate malaria control’ was coupled with iron supplementation programmes.
1The most recent Cochrane review, on 35 randomized trials in 31 955 children in malaria-endemic areas, reaffirms the wisdom of adopting this approach.5Notably, the review omitted an analysis of iron administration during proven malaria episodes. Iron supplementation improved haemo-globin and reduced anaemia, but did not increase the risk of severe or clinical malaria when regular malaria preven- tion or management services were provided.However, ma- larial parasite density was higher in four of the six trials reporting such data.Further, in areas where such serviceswere unavailable, iron (with or without folic acid) in- creased the incidence of malaria (risk ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.02, 1.31; 19 086 participants).There is still uncertaintywhether iron supplementation alone increases the risk of malaria in the subset of iron-replete, non-anaemic children living in malaria-endemic areas.Iron supplementation also probably facilitates the repli- cation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
6In a large study of HIV-infected adults ( n¼40 657), a higher risk of mortality was documented in those who were iron supple- mented, particularly if they were non-anaemic.7Two small studies in children with HIV infection provide conflicting evidence.
