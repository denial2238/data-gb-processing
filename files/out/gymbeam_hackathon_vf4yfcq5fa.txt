This study investigated whether whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) mitigates inflammation and endotoxin tolerance in THP ‐1 human monocytic leukemia cells. Methods: Endotoxin tolerance can be experimentally reproduced by two consecutive stimulations with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).THP ‐1 cells were incubated with LPS and WPH (first stimulation).After collecting the culture supernatant to evaluate the effect on inflammation, the cells were washed and restimulated by 100 ng/ml LPS (second stimulation).The culture supernatant was again collected to evaluate the effect on endotoxin tolerance.Concentra- tions of LPS and WPH in the first stimulation were adjusted to evaluate their dose dependency.Cytokine levels in the supernatant were determined by enzyme ‐linked immunosorbent assay.Statistical analysis was performed using the student's t‐test or Dunnett's test.
Results: Five mg/ml WPH significantly decreased interleukin (IL) ‐6(p= .006) and IL ‐10 (p< .001) levels after the first LPS stimulation (1000 ng/ml). WPH significantly increased tumor necrosis factor ‐alpha ( p< .001) and IL ‐10 (p= .014) levels after the second LPS stimulation.The suppressive effect of WPH on inflammation and endotoxin tolerance was dependent on the concentrations of LPS and WPH.The effective dose of WPH for endotoxin tolerance was lower than its effective dose for inflammation.Conclusion: WPH mitigated both inflammation and endotoxin tolerance.Therefore, WPH might be a candidate for valuable food ingredients to control both inflammation and immunosuppression after severe insults.Immun Inflamm Dis .2022;10:e737.

However, patients can subsequently experience an immunosuppressive phase.3For example, most septic patients are in a state of immunosuppression and die from opportunistic infections.4,5 Endotoxin tolerance is one of the immunosuppressive conditions.6Endotoxin tolerance refers to a reduction in response to endotoxins after various inflammatory condi- tions, such as sepsis, trauma, and surgery.7,8Recently, it has been reported that the major immunologic abnormal-ity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID ‐19) is a profound defect in host immunity including T cell exhaustion and monocyte endotoxin tolerance, 9and that endotoxin tolerance is more severe in critical ill patients with COVID ‐19 than those without COVID ‐19.10Endotoxin tolerance can be experimentally reproduced by twoconsecutive stimulations with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 11 Monocytes and macrophages are important in thedevelopment of endotoxin tolerance.
12,13Monocytes from patients with sepsis, who are known to be in the state ofendotoxin tolerance, produce less pro ‐inflammatory cyto- kines, such as tumor necrosis factor ‐alpha (TNF ‐α), interleukin (IL) ‐12, IL ‐23, and IL ‐6, in response to LPS stimulation, compared to monocytes from healthy volunteers. 11Heagy et al.14showed that the low levels of cytokine production from the whole blood of patientsadmitted to the intensive care unit stimulated by LPS ex vivoare associated with poor clinical outcomes, including high mortality.The experimental approach that uses LPSstimulation has also been applied to the THP ‐1h u m a n monocytic leukemia cell line.Endotoxin tolerance was assessed in THP ‐1 cells based on the reduction in TNF ‐α expression or production.11,15 –17Following severe insults, it is important to control both inflammation and immunosuppression.
In an experiment in which mono- cytic cells from healthy volunteers were stimulatedtwice by LPS, the first LPS stimulation correlated inversely with TNF ‐αlevels after the second LPS stimulation. 18 These findings imply that the severity of the initial inflammation is associated with the severity of the ensuing immunosuppression.Whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) and peptides derived from whey protein have various functions demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro experiments, such as anti ‐ inflammation,19–21antihypertensive,22improving glucose23 and lipid metabolism,24and strengthening skin barrier.25,26 In regard to anti ‐inflammatory effect, Tavares et al.19 confirmed that oral administration of WPH prevents inflammation via prostaglandin system under the pawedema test in mice.Kume et al.20reported that an immune ‐modulating diet containing whey peptides sup- presses bacterial translocat ion and inflammatory cytokine levels in the rat model of small bowel disorders.
Moreover, Ma et al.21demonstrated peptides derived from whey protein reduce expression of inflammatory cytokine in RAW 264.7mouse macrophage cells. In this study, we hypothesized that suppression of inflammation by WPH could mitigate subsequent endotoxin tolerance and investigated thishypothesis in THP ‐1c e l l s .2|MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 |Preparation of WPH WPH was obtained from Morinaga Milk Industry (Tokyo, Japan).The degree of hydrolysis of the WPH was 16%.WPH was dissolved at 20 mg/ml in RPMI 1640 (Gibco)supplemented with 1% penicillin ‐streptomycin (Gibco).LPS contained in WPH was removed by centrifugation using an Amicon Ultra ‐15 100 K centrifugal filter (Merck Millipore).Endospecy ES ‐50M set (Seikagaku) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol to confirm LPS removal.The fetal calf serum (FCS) concentration of the WPH sample was adjusted to 10%.
2.2 |Cell culture and stimulation THP‐1 human monocytic leukemia cells obtained from KAC were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS(Cell growth culture No. 103; KAC) supplemented with1% penicillin ‐streptomycin (Gibco).The cells were maintained at a density of <1.0 × 10 6cells/ml at 37°C in a 5% CO 2incubator.The schematic experimental procedure is shown in Figure 1A.The cells were seeded onto 24 ‐well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105cells/well and incubated for 24 h (n=3–4).The cells were then treated with WPH and LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4 (L4391; Sigma ‐Aldrich)2o f1 0 | ISHIKAWA ET AL .FIGURE 1 Whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) reduces the production of interleukin (IL) ‐6 and IL ‐10 after the first lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and increases the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ‐αand IL ‐10 after the second LPS stimulation.(A) Schematic representation of the experimental procedure.(B –F).
Cells were not stimulated or stimulated by 5 mg/ml WPH or 1000 ng/ml LPS, followed by restimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS. The levels of (B) TNF ‐α, (C) IL ‐6, and (D) IL ‐10 after the first LPS stimulation, and (E) TNF ‐αand (F) IL‐10 after the second LPS stimulation were measured.Three independent experiments were performed.Similar results were obtained and the representative result was represented.Values are presented as mean ± SEM (n= 4).p< .05 and 0.01 are indicated by * and **, respectively, compared to 0 mg/ml WPH in the same LPS concentration.Stim, stimulation.ISHIKAWA ET AL .|3o f1 0 and incubated for 24 h (first LPS stimulation).The concentrations of WPH and LPS were adjusted for eachexperiment and are described in the figure legends.Following incubation, culture supernatants were col- lected, and the cells were washed twice with the mediumand reseeded.Following 1 h of incubation, the cells were restimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 5 h (second LPS stimulation).
This culture supernatant was also collected.All culture supernatants were stored at −80°C. To investigate whether the effect of WPH was dependent on the LPS concentration during the first stimulation, cells were stimulated by 0, 10, 100, or1000 ng/ml LPS under the condition of 0 or 5 mg/ml WPH, followed by restimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS.In evaluating the dose dependency of WPH, cells werestimulated by 0 or 100 ng/ml LPS under the condition of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 5 mg/ml WPH, and followed by restimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS.2.3 |Measurement of cytokines The levels of IL ‐6, IL‐10, and TNF ‐αin the supernatants were determined using the following commercial enzyme ‐ linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits according to themanufacturer's protocol; IL ‐6 Human Uncoated ELISA Kit (88‐7066‐88), IL ‐10 Human Uncoated ELISA Kit (88 ‐7106‐ 88), and TNF alpha Human Uncoated ELISA Kit (88 ‐7346‐ 88) (all from Invitrogen).
2.4 |Statistical analyses Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and were analyzed using JMP version 13.2.1(SAS Institute). The student's t‐test was used.In the results of the experiment to determine the dose dependency of WPH, Dunnett's test was used formultiple comparisons between THP ‐1 cells received with first LPS stimulation.In Dunnett's test, the cells without WPH during first LPS stimulation was used as control.Statistical significance was set at p< .05.3|RESULTS 3.1 |WPH reduces IL ‐6 and IL ‐10 production after the first LPS stimulationand increases TNF ‐αand IL ‐10 production after the second LPS stimulation The anti ‐inflammatory effect is often assessed by changes in cytokine levels in LPS ‐stimulated cells.21Toinvestigate whether WPH has anti ‐inflammatory effects, we determined the levels of TNF ‐α,I L‐6, and IL ‐10 after the first LPS stimulation.No difference in TNF ‐αlevels between cells with and without WPH was evident (Figure 1B).
However, IL ‐6(p= .006) and IL ‐10 (p< .001) levels in the cells incubated with WPH were significantly lower than in those without WPH incuba- tion (Figure 1C,D ). Endotoxin tolerance is assessed by a decrease in TNF ‐ αproduction after a second LPS stimulation.11To investigate whether WPH can mitigate endotoxin toler- ance, the levels of TNF ‐αand IL ‐10 after the second LPS stimulation were determined.TNF ‐αlevels in the cells that received the first LPS stimulation were clearly lower than those from cells that did not receive LPS stimulation(Figure 1E).This indicates that the first LPS stimulation for 24 h induced endotoxin tolerance.In the cells that received the first LPS stimulation, the levels of TNF ‐α (p< .001) and IL ‐10 ( p= .014) after the second LPS stimulation were significantly higher from cells incu- bated with WPH compared to cells without WPHaddition (Figure 1E,F).
These collective results indicate that WPH reduced the levels of IL ‐6 and IL ‐10 after the first LPS stimulation and increased TNF ‐αand IL ‐10 production after the second LPS stimulation. 3.2 |WPH ‐mediated mitigation of inflammation and endotoxin tolerance is dependent on the LPS dose during the firststimulation We next investigated whether the suppressive effect of WPH on inflammation and endotoxin tolerance wasdependent on the LPS dose during the first stimulation.After the first stimulation of THP ‐1 cells with 100 and 1000 ng/ml LPS, the IL ‐6 levels in cells incubated with WPH were significantly lower ( p= .006 and p< .001, respectively) than that in cells without WPH incubation (Figure 2A).The IL ‐10 levels from cells incubated with WPH were significantly lower after 1000 ng/ml LPS stimulation ( p= .004) and tended to be lower after 100 ng/ml LPS stimulation ( p= .078) than that from cells incubated without WPH (Figure 2B).
However, there was no difference in the IL ‐6 and IL ‐10 levels after the first stimulation with 10 ng/ml LPS between the cells incubated with and without WPH (Figure 2A,B ). When cells were treated with 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml LPS as the first stimulation, ( p= .035, p< .001, and p< .001, respectively) TNF ‐αlevels after the second LPS stimulation from the cells incubated with WPH during the first stimulation were significantly higher than that4o f1 0 | ISHIKAWA ET AL .from the cells incubated without WPH (Figure 2C).Furthermore, when cells were treated with 100 and1000 ng/ml LPS as the first stimulation ( p= .0097 and p= .013, respectively), IL ‐10 levels after the second LPS stimulation from the cells incubated with WPH weresignificantly higher than those from the cells incubated without WPH (Figure 2D).
These results indicate that WPH reduced the production of IL ‐6 and IL ‐10 after the first LPS stimulation and increased the production of TNF‐αand IL ‐10 after the second LPS stimulation, depending on the dose in the first LPS stimulation. 3.3 |Dose dependency of WPH in mitigating inflammation and endotoxintolerance To further characterize the effects of WPH on inflamma- tion and endotoxin tolerance, we investigated the dose dependency of WPH.After the first LPS stimulation, the levels of IL ‐6 (p= .007) and IL ‐10 (p= .005) in the cells incubated with 5 mg/ml WPH were significantly lower than those in cells incubated without WPH (Figure 3A,B ).However, the levels of IL ‐6 and IL ‐10 after the first stimulation of cells incubated with 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml WPH did not change from the cells incubated without WPH (Figure 3A,B ).
After the second LPS stimulation, the TNF ‐αlevel in the cells incubated with 1, 2, and 5 mg/ml WPH, but not 0.5 mg/ml WPH, during the first stimulation wassignificantly ( p< .001 for all comparisons) higher than that from the cells incubated without WPH (Figure 3C). After the second LPS stimulation, the IL ‐10 level in cells incubated with 2 and 5 mg/ml WPH ( p= .041 and p< .001, respectively), but not at 0.5 and 1 mg/ml WPH, was higher than that from the cells incubated without WPH (Figure 3D).These results indicate that WPH decreased IL ‐6 and IL ‐10 production after the first LPS stimulation at 5 mg/ml, increased TNF ‐αproduction (A) (B) (C) (D) FIGURE 2 Whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) mitigation of inflammation and endotoxin tolerance are dependent on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) dose in the first LPS stimulation.(A –D) Cells were not stimulated or stimulated by 5 mg/ml WPH or 10, 100, or 1000 ng/ml LPS, followed by restimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS.
The levels of (A) interleukin (IL) ‐6 and (B) IL ‐10 after the first LPS stimulation, (C) tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ‐α, and (D) IL ‐10 after the second LPS stimulation were measured.

6,8 Endotoxin tolerance is one of the causes of immuno- suppression.6In this study, we demonstrated that WPH mitigates inflammation and subsequent endotoxin toler-ance in THP ‐1 cells. After insult, various cytokines are released into circulation.The levels of the IL ‐6 inflammatory cytokine, one of the biomarkers of trauma and sepsis, in patients with sepsis are correlated with the severity of organfailure.27Consistent with previous studies showing anti ‐ inflammatory effects of fermented milk28and a diet that includes whey peptides,20WPH reduced IL ‐6 production after the first LPS stimulation in the present study.TNF ‐ αis an important pro ‐inflammatory cytokine.29High TNF‐αlevels are associated with mortality in patients with sepsis.30In this study, WPH did not affect TNF ‐α levels after the first stimulation.These findings differ from that of Ma et al.,21who reported that peptides isolated from whey protein reduced TNF ‐αlevels in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells.
In THP ‐1 cells, a study reported that TNF ‐αlevels peaked 4 h after LPS stimulation, while IL ‐6 levels peaked after 12 or 24 h.31 Therefore, the different effects of WPH on TNF ‐αand IL‐6 levels could have occurred because of the time point when the supernatants were collected. In the presentstudy, WPH decreased the level of the anti ‐inflammatory cytokine IL ‐10 after the first LPS stimulation.A previous FIGURE 3 Dose dependency of whey protein hydrolysate (WPH).(A –C) Cells were not stimulated or stimulated by 0.5, 1, 2, or 5 mg/ml WPH, or 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by restimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS.The levels of (A) interleukin (IL) ‐6 and (B) IL ‐10 after the first LPS stimulation and (C) tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ‐αand (D) IL ‐10 after the second LPS stimulation were measured.Three independent experiments were performed.Similar results were obtained and the representative result was represented.Values are presented as mean ± SEM ( n= 4).

Stim, stimulation.6o f1 0 | ISHIKAWA ET AL .study reported that IL ‐10 was produced in response to insult, and the overproduction of IL ‐10 was associated with severity and fatal outcome in patients with sepsis.32 Therefore, reducing IL ‐10 may have a positive effect on at least these patients.
Endotoxin tolerance is characterized by a reduction in response to endotoxin7,8and is often assessed by a decrease in TNF ‐αproduction or expression in response to successive LPS stimulation.11,17Previous in vitro studies have shown that the ability of IL ‐10 production in response to LPS stimulation is decreased due to endotoxin tolerance.33,34Moreover, low IL ‐10 production after ex vivo LPS stimulation of whole blood from patients with sepsis may be related to persistent organ dysfunction.35In this study, after the second LPS stimulation, the levels of TNF ‐αand IL ‐10 from cells treated with the first LPS stimulation were clearly decreased compared to those from cells not treated withthe first LPS stimulation, and WPH inhibited the decreases in the production of TNF ‐αand IL ‐10. These results indicate that THP ‐1 cells acquired endotoxin tolerance, which could be mitigated by WPH.Endotoxintolerance is regarded as a necessary mechanism for self ‐ protection.
8For example, mice prestimulated with a low dose of LPS displayed a reduced death rate uponrestimulation with a lethal dose of LPS. 36In humans, consecutive LPS administrations reportedly attenuated the fever response.37Meanwhile, lower cytokine produc- tion when blood was stimulated by LPS ex vivo, that is endotoxin tolerance, was related to poorer clinical outcomes in patients with trauma, sepsis, or in theintensive care unit.14,38,39Recently, endotoxin tolerance has also been regarded as an important issue in COVID ‐ 19,9,10Furthermore, the direct relationship between mortality and the severity of endotoxin tolerance wasdemonstrated in the animal model with a severe polymicrobial intra ‐abdominal infection.40These find- ings concerned with endotoxin tolerance have attractedclinical attention.
Although endotoxin tolerance has two different aspects, we focused on the latter (i.e., an unlikable effect on clinical outcomes in patients withsevere insults) and demonstrated the suppression of endotoxin tolerance by WPH. Previous studies have demonstrated that the sirtuin ‐1 inhibitor and capric acid mitigated endotoxin tolerance in THP ‐1 cells.15,16Other substances may be identified in future studies.Some studies have investigated whether cytokines produced during initial inflammation are associated withendotoxin tolerance development.Preincubation with IL‐10 or transforming growth factor ‐beta (TGF ‐β), neither TNF ‐αnor IL ‐6, partially led to endotoxin tolerance in monocytic cells.18,41Randow et al.41demon- strated that IL ‐10 and TGF ‐βproduced during initialinflammation are necessary to lead to endotoxin toler- ance using neutralizing antibodies.
However, the needfor IL ‐10 to develop endotoxin tolerance is controversial given the observation that IL ‐10 knockout mice develop endotoxin tolerance. 42In this study, WPH decreased IL‐10 levels after the first LPS stimulation only when the first LPS dose was higher than 100 ng/ml.However, WPH inhibited the reduced level of TNF ‐αafter the second LPS stimulation when the first LPS dose was10–1000 ng/ml.Furthermore, the effective WPH dose to mitigate endotoxin tolerance was lower than that which affected IL ‐10 levels during initial inflammation.Thus, WPH affected endotoxin tolerance, even if it did not influence IL ‐10 levels produced during initial inflamma- tion.These findings are not entirely consistent with ourhypothesis that suppression of inflammation by WPH can mitigate the subsequent endotoxin tolerance and suggest that WPH could affect inflammation andendotoxin tolerance through different mechanisms.
However, there is a possibility that anti ‐inflammatory effects were not detectable because we evaluatedinflammation and endotoxin tolerance only by ELISA ‐ determined cytokine levels. Additionally, it was difficult to detect TGF ‐βproduction in our experimental proce- dure because the cell culture medium contained TGF ‐β.To overcome these limitations, further analyses are necessary.These include the detection of mRNA expres- sion.LPS activates Toll ‐like receptor (TLR) ‐4 and its downstream signaling, including nuclear factor ‐κB (NF‐κB) pathway or mitogen ‐activated protein kinase pathway.This signaling is closely related to endotoxintolerance.
8,11,43,44It has been reported that IL ‐1 receptor ‐ associated kinase (IRAK) 3, which is mainly found in macrophages and monocytes, inhibits the signaling from TLR‐4 to downstream NF ‐κB and reduces cytokine production such as TNF ‐α.11,44Very recently, meta ‐ analysis reported that increase of IRAK3 expression is related to the reduction of TNF ‐αexpression after second stimulation by LPS or other TLRs agonist in vivo and in vitro.43,44Further study about these signaling pathways is necessary to clarify more detailed mechanisms formitigating endotoxin tolerance by WPH. This study is significant from the perspective that WPH can be a candidate food ingredient to controlinflammation and immunosuppression after severeclinical insults, such as surgery, sepsis, severe burns, and trauma.
Like these clinical conditions, since patients with severe COVID ‐19 suffer from systemic inflamma- tion and subsequent immunosuppression, treatment to enhance or suppress immune response should be applied based on the immune status. 45This implicates that it is important to control both inflammation and immuno- suppression after severe clinical insults.However, thisISHIKAWA ET AL .|7o f1 0 study has several limitations.First, this study did not consider the digestion and absorption of WPH and theblood level of WPH.Second, since THP ‐1 is a cell line and may be less sensitive to LPS and/or other substances such as capric acid than peripheral blood mononuclearcells, 16,46THP‐1 cells were treated in this study with high‐concentration of WPH, which is thought to be over a physiological concentration range.
Third, although weobserved that WPH inhibited the reduction of TNF ‐αand IL‐10 after the second stimulation, it could not restore the levels of these cytokines to those in cells not exposed to the first LPS stimulation. To solve these limitationsrelated to the clinical efficacy of WPH, the physiological efficacy of WPH needs to be investigated ex vivo or in vivo, such as in animal tests and/or clinical tests.Forth,we did not evaluate whether WPH neutralizes LPS.It is known that specific peptides such as lactoferricin, which is derived from lactoferrin of whey protein hydrolyzed bypepsin, can bind to LPS and suppress inflammation.47 However, WPH may contain few lactoferricin becausethe raw material of WPH, whey protein concentrate,contains few lactoferrin.Finally, only a single type ofWPH was used.Kiewiet et al.48demonstrated that the effects of protein hydrolysates on cytokine production are dependent on the degree of hydrolysis.
It is necessary toidentify the fraction or sequence of bioactive WPH peptides and to investigate whether other WPHs, whose degree of hydrolysis differs from current WPH, canmitigate inflammation and endotoxin tolerance. 5|CONCLUSION We demonstrated that WPH mitigates both inflammation and endotoxin tolerance.This mainly agrees with ourhypothesis that suppression of inflammation by WPH can mitigate endotoxin tolerance.However, there are some exceptions, such as the effective dose of WPH on endotoxintolerance is lower than the effective dose on inflammation.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the simultaneous efficacy of a single substance onboth inflammation and endotoxin tolerance.Further detailed studies are required to clarify the relationship between inflammation and endotoxin tolerance.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.Fuka Ishikawa prepared the original draft.
