We aim to shed light on its potential as a therapeutic agent for managing SLE. Methods Forty BALB/c mice were used in this study.Hydralazine hydrochloride was orally administered in a concentration of 25 mg/kg to the five mice groups once weekly for a period of 5 weeks to induce a lupus- like condition.The untreated group was the normal control group.To confirm the development of lupus, an ANA test was conducted.After the mice tested positive for ANA, drug treatments commenced.The negative control group did not receive any drug treatment.The treatments included prednisolone, methotrexate and vitamin E, all administered at a concentration of 25 mg/kg, with a higher dose of vitamin E (50 mg/kg) also administered.
Results Notably, on day 35, after drug treatment, we observed that mice that received vitamin E at a dosage of 50 mg/kg (3.01±0.100) had a slight decrease in lymphocyte hydrogen peroxide radicals when compared with the group receiving 25 mg/kg of vitamin E (3.30±0.100) (p<0.05). This finding suggests that the scavenging potential of vitamin E is dose dependent.Conclusion This study suggests that vitamin E supplementation, especially at a higher dose (50 mg/ kg), holds promise in ameliorating lupus- like conditions.These findings warrant further exploration and may offer a potential avenue for improving the disease status of patients experiencing SLE.
INTRODUCTION SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the body‘s cells and tissues resulting in inflammation.1 It is treated with high to low doses of corticoster - oids usually followed by the use of steroid- sparing measures in the form of immunosup- pressives such as methotrexate.2 Long- term use of glucocorticoid can increase the suscep- tibility to infections, osteoporosis, cardiovas- cular problems, dermatological issues and neuropsychiatric symptoms.3 Immunosup- pressive drugs such as methotrexate expose the patient to infections, lowered blood counts and liver problems.4 To address the need for safer lupus management, the study explores the potential of hydralazine, a hypertension medication known to induce a lupus- like syndrome in some patients.5 This phenomenon offers insights into potential treatments of SLE.
While antioxidants have been studied in autoimmune diseases,67–9 their effectiveness against reactive oxygen species is limited.10 Hydrogen peroxide is a potent oxidising agent that is a byproduct of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.11 Excess hydrogen peroxide levels in the cell trigger apoptosis. This facilitates autoanti- genic exposure and contributes to the devel- opment of lupus.12 Vitamin E is recognised for its potent antioxidant properties and anti- inflammatory effects and it has shown promise in mitigating certain health conditions.9 13 The study’s findings support its potential for WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC ⇒SLE poses significant challenges due to its incur - able nature and the adverse effects associated with standard treatments such as corticosteroids and im- munosuppresants.Additionally, drug- induced lupus- like syndrome, such as that induced by hydralazine, represents a distinct entity, although with some similarities to classic SLE.
Vitamin E has been long recognised for its antioxidant and anti- inflammatory properties. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS ⇒This study delves into the potential of vitamin E as an ameliorative agent for lupus- like conditions induced by hydralazine, providing an alternative approach to managing the complex nature of SLE.The research unveils a dose- dependent reduction in hydrogen peroxide radicals with a higher dose of vitamin E, highlighting its potential therapeutic impact.HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY ⇒The findings of this study offer a promising avenue for addressing lupus.Specifically, the higher dosage of vitamin E shows potential in mitigating the con- dition.While further investigation is essential, these results could eventually translate into improved management strategies for individuals experiencing SLE, potentially reducing reliance on corticosteroids and immunosuppresants.Githaiga FM, et al.Lupus Science & Medicine 2023;10:e001033.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Experimental animals Thirty- six healthy BALB/c mice aged 3–4 weeks were acquired from the animal breeding unit at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Livestock, Kabete, Kenya, for this study.The remaining four were used to produce reference ranges for both the haematological and sero- logical tests.The study adhered to the ARRIVE checklist for reporting animal research.14 The mice were acclima- tised for 7 days in shoebox cages in rooms that were kept between 20°C and 25°C before the experiments began.The mice were supplied with pellets and wood shavings as bedding and access to clean drinking water throughout the study.Mice were identified by sex and cage cards.Experimental design BALB/c mice were randomly allocated to six groups (table 1), with three female and three male mice in each group.
Group A (normal control) received 1.0 mL of sterile water. Groups B–F were administered hydralazine hydrochloride at a concentration of 25 mg/kg every 7 days for 5 weeks.The lupus- like condition was confirmed with an antibody nuclear test on the 35th day during hydrala- zine treatment.Subsequent drug treatments were as follows: ►Group B (negative control) received no drug treatment.►Group C was treated with prednisolone at 25 mg/kg every 7 days for 5 weeks.►Group D received methotrexate at 25 mg/kg every 7 days for 5 weeks.►Group E was treated with vitamin E at 25 mg/kg every 7 days for 5 weeks.►Group F received vitamin E at 50 mg/kg every 7 days for 5 weeks.Lupus-like condition detection Following a 1- week acclimation period, mice aged 5–6 weeks, from groups B to F, received oral doses of hydralazine hydrochloride blood pressure 25 mg/ kg every 7 days for a period of 35 days.The untreated group served as normal control group.
A sandwich ELISA was performed using the Biorbyt ANA Mouse ANA ELISA Kit (catalogue number, orb566261) once weekly to confirm the development of autoantibodies specific to lupus. Mice were closely monitored weekly for weight changes.Drug treatments On the 35th day post- hydralazine treatment, all treated groups that had received hydralazine had confirmed the presence of ANA antibodies.Drug treatments were initi- ated in all lupus- induced mice every 7 days for 5 weeks.The negative control group did not receive any drug treatments.
Oral administration was performed using a gastric oral gavage.Table 1 Experimental design Groupings Treatments Duration Group A Normal control Sterile water 35 days Group B Negative control 25 mg/kg hydralazine 35 days Group C 1st positive control 25 mg/kg hydralazine+25 mg/kg prednisolone 35 days Group D 2nd positive control 25 mg/kg hydralazine+5 mg/kg methotrexate 35 days Group E Experimental group 1 25 mg/kg hydralazine+25 mg/kg vitamin E 35 days Group F Experimental group 2 25 mg/kg hydralazine+50 mg/kg vitamin E 35 days Table 2 Scavenging potential of vitamin E H202 concentration (mM) (interpolated) GroupsDays 0 7 14 21 28 35 Normal control 2.065±0.064a1.95± 0.105a1.98±0.040a1.98±0.007a2.06±0.081a1.96±0.020a Negative control 7.91±0.080b7.63±0.040b7.44±0.20b7.63±0.350b7.11±0.011b7.04±0.030b Prednisolone 25 mg/bdw 7.23±0.006b6.72±0.139b6.66±0.14b6.41±0.092b5.92±0.021b5.06±0.019b Methotrexate 25 mg/bdw 7.64±0.184b6.68±0.200b5.87±0.047b5.73±0.041b6.08±0.049b5.31±0.010b Vitamin E 25 mg/bdw 7.26±0.60b6.52±0.06b6.08±0.051b5.48±0.028b5.12±0.059b3.30±0.100a Vitamin E 50 mg/bdw 7.41±0.116b6.12±0.017b4.52±0.277b5.71±0.047b4.85±0.133b3.01±0.100a Values expressed as mean±SD of the three replicates.

Fifty microlitres of lymphocyte cell suspension was added to the wells of a clear v- bottomed 96 multi- well plate together with carboxy- H2dcfda. The cells were covered and incubated for 30 min in the dark, in a conventional incubator at 37℃ and 5% CO2 concentra- tion.Carboxy- H2dcfda containing medium was removed and the cells were washed by adding 200 µl phosphate buffer saline.Fifty microlitres of cell buffer was added to the multi- well plate.The plate was then be placed in a microplate reader and was read at 480 nm excitation and 520 nm emission.Fifty microlitres of lymphocyte cell suspension was pelleted by at 250×g for 5 min.A P1000 pipette was used to plate the cells in a 35 mm dish with a cell density of 1×106 cells/mL.The culture plate was then left stationary for 30 min at room temperature to allow for sedimentation and adhesion of cells onto the cover slip or well bottom.A drop of sensor was added to the cell culture and mixed gently.
Cells were analysed using the EVOS M5000 fluorescence microscope at excitation 488 nm and emission at 515 nm. Digital images were captured under the same acquisition parameters.Haematological, biochemical and immunological analysis On the 35th day post- drug treatments, 2 mL of blood was collected through the renal- orbital sinus.One millilitre was placed into EDTA tubes for a full, while the other 1 mL was placed in serum separator tubes to be used for biochemical analysis.One millilitre of blood was divided into two equal portions to determine a complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs).Complete blood count was performed using the veteri- nary haematology auto- analyser (Sysmex Roche DM9600 VET).The serum was divided into two portions to deter - mine biochemical parameters and to measure ANA levels.The collected (0.5 mL) serum was then transferred into a polypropylene tube, and 80 µL of the serum was loaded into the biochemistry auto- analyser VB1.
Investigating ESRs The Westergren method was used to measure the ESR. Whole blood (0.5 mL) was diluted with 0.5 mL of 0.85% NaCl.The tube was carefully filled to the zero mark without adding bubbles.The tubes were then placed on a vertical stand at level position for 60 min at room Figure 1 Fluorescence microscopy images of lymphocyte cells captured under ×400 magnification stained using the roGFP sensor in both control and experimental mice groups.(A) normal control, (B) negative control, (C) prednisolone (Pred.), (D) methotrexate (MTX), (E) vitamin E (Vit.E) 25 mg/kg bdw, (F) Vit.E 50 mg/kg bdw.The scale bar on each image is 50 µm.bdw, body weight.Githaiga FM, et al.Lupus Science & Medicine 2023;10:e001033.doi:10.1136/lupus-2023-001033 4Lupus Science & Medicine temperature.ESR was calculated as the distance from the zero mark to the top of the red blood cell (RBC) column.Determining ANA concentrations ANAs were analysed to track the development of lupus induced in mice.
One hundred microlitres of standard solution was added into five tubes from the zero tube. One hundred microlitres of diluted sample diluted at one- half with sample dilution buffer and added into test wells.The plate was sealed and incubated at 37°C for 90 min.The seal was removed, and its contents were disposed.Wash buffer was used to rinse the plate twice.One hundred (100) µL of biotin- labelled antigen working solution was added into standard, test sample and blank wells.The plate was sealed and incubated at 37°C for 60 min.The plate was washed again.One hundred of SABC (HRP- Streptavidin Conjugate) was added into each and incubated at 37°C for half an hour.The plate was washed again.Ninety (90) µL TMB (3,3',5,5'-Tetrameth- ylbenzidine) substrate was added into each well and incubated at 37°C in the dark room for 20 min.Fifty (50) µL of stop solution was then added into each well.Optical density was recorded after adding the stop solu- tion using the GO ESW V.1.01.12.
The target concen- tration of the samples can be interpolated from the standard curve.Determination of body and relative organ weights Weekly body weights for each animal were measured and recorded during drug treatments. Following anaesthesia, mice were sacrificed by decapitation 24 hours after the last dose of drug treatments.Kidney, liver, brain, spleen and heart were rapidly harvested.Figure 2 Red blood cell (RBC) indices in mice with hydralazine- induced lupus.*Significant differences were observed at p<0.05.(A) Haematocrit (HCT), (B) RBCs, (C) Haemoglobin (HGB), (D) mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), (E) mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and (F) mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC).bdw, body weight.Figure 3 Effect of vitamin E (Vit.E) on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).*Significant differences were observed at p<0.05.MTX, methotrexate; Pred., prednisolone.Githaiga FM, et al.Lupus Science & Medicine 2023;10:e001033.

Tissues were excised and fixed in a solution of 10% neutral buff- ered formalin followed by gradual dehydration in ascending concentrations of alcohol at 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100%. Samples were cleared with xylene and embedded in liquid paraffin to prevent their destruction.The tissues were then processed routinely for examination by slicing them into thin sections of 5 µm using a rotary and transferred onto a microscope slide.Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism V.8.0 software package.Data were compared using one- way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post- hoc test.Simple linear regression was used to determine hydrogen peroxide concentrations.The level of significance was set at p<0.05 (95% CI).RESULTS Evaluating the impact of vitamin E on hydrogen peroxide radical levels Day 0 data were recorded on the 35th day post- hydralazine treatment.
Vitamin E 50 mg/kg had significantly (p<0.05) depleted levels of lymphocyte hydrogen peroxide radical levels compared with the lower dose of vitamin E on the 35th day post- drug treatments. The total hydrogen peroxide concentrations were quantified using a standard curve (Y=0.007740x+0.01703; R2=0.9298; table 2).Table 3 ANA titre concentrations Treatment groupsANA titre concentration (ng/mL) Males Females Normal control 1.58±0.0944a1.64±0.1499a Negative control 30.48±0.9395b32.30±3.274b Prednisolone 25 mg/kg 28.04±0.4760b28.70±0.8509b Methotrexate 25 mg/kg 26.23±0.6452b26.95±1.4430b Vitamin E 25 mg/kg 2.33±0.5686a3.71±1.5690a Vitamin E 50 mg/kg 1.50±0.1950a1.712±0.4031a Results are expressed as mean±SD for three animals per group.Means that do not share a letter are significantly different (p≤0.05).Figure 6 Evaluating the effect of vitamin E on liver function in lupus- induced mice.*Significant differences were observed at p<0.05.

Githaiga FM, et al.Lupus Science & Medicine 2023;10:e001033.doi:10.1136/lupus-2023-001033 7Animal models To validate the results of this assay, the fluorescence intensity of lymphocytes collected from the mice in all experimental groups was analysed using fluorescence microscopy.Live cell imaging of lymphocyte cells from the negative control group, methotrexate and prednisolone groups showed elevated fluorescence intensity.Lymphocytes collected from the vitamin E treatment groups had minimal fluorescence (figure 1).Vitamin E prevented haemolytic anaemia associated with lupus After observing vitamin E’s positive impact on haema- tocrit levels in lupus- induced mice, we examined its effects on RBCs and haemoglobin .
In the pred- nisolone and methotrexate treatment groups, RBC count and haemoglobin levels notably decreased. However, both vitamin E doses significantly improved RBC count and haemoglobin levels .We also investi- gated vitamin E’s influence on specific RBC indices, finding that both doses provided significant protec- tion against the reduction in mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration values.In contrast, mice in the prednisolone and methotrexate treatment groups exhibited significantly lower RBC indices (figure 2).Vitamin E prevented inflammation associated with lupus ESRs were used to assess the impact of vitamin E on inflam- mation associated with lupus.Mice groups that received prednisolone and both doses of vitamin E recorded low ESRs (figure 3).Figure 7 Creatinine levels in lupus- induced mice.*Significant differences were observed at p<0.05.MTX, methotrexate; pred., prednisolone; Vit.E, vitamin E.

Vitamin E prevented thrombocytopenia associated with lupus No significant differences were observed between platelet count values (k/µL) between mice treated with both doses of vitamin E compared with the normal control group. Mice treated with prednisolone recorded signifi- cantly elevated platelet count, while methotrexate- treated mice had significantly low platelet count (figure 5).ANA titre concentrations in drug treatment groups Positive ANA titre concentration values determined using the positive index method showed that mean ANA titres from prednisolone, methotrexate and negative control groups were above the positive index number and consid- ered to be positive for the presence of ANA.Mice treated with vitamin E had significantly low ANA titres (table 3).
Vitamin E prevented a rise in liver and kidney biomarkers Vitamin E- treated mice had no significant change in alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase, gamma- glutamyl tansferase (GGT), albumin and total bilirubin levels. Prednisolone and methotrexate treatment groups recorded significantly high levels of ALT, GGT and ALP.Prednisolone- treated mice showed significantly reduced total bilirubin levels.Albumin was significantly reduced in the methotrexate group (figure 6).Kidney function was assessed by eval- uating serum creatinine and electrolyte levels.Vitamin E effectively prevented an increase in serum creatinine levels, while methotrexate- treated mice had significantly higher serum creatinine levels (figure 7).Prednisolone- treated mice had notably low calcium levels, while the methotrexate group exhibited signifi- cantly reduced sodium levels, contrasting with the pred- nisolone group’s higher sodium levels.
In contrast, there were no significant differences in electrolyte levels between the normal control group and both vitamin E treatment groups. Additionally, phosphorus levels remained consis- tent across all treatment groups (figure 8).Effect of drug treatments on body and relative organ weights All treatment groups did not show any significant differ - ences in relative organ weights (table 4).Exposure of mice to prednisolone resulted in a significant increase in body weight compared with the normal control group (figure 9).Effect of drug treatments on serum glucose levels This study assessed blood glucose levels of lupus- induced mice.Mice exposed to prednisolone recorded signifi- cantly higher glucose levels compared with healthy mice (figure 10).

Mice that received prednisolone exhibited moderate tubular degeneration, haemorrhage and dilation of tubules. Kidney tissues from the methotrexate group had the same histological changes as prednisolone only more severe.Kidney sections from lupus- induced female mice treated with vitamin E 25 mg/kg showed mild tubular degeneration.Mice administered with vitamin E 50 mg/kg showed a glomerulus with an intact Bowman’s capsule with mild tubular degenera- tion being observed in males (figure 11).Vitamin E ameliorated liver injury The healthy control group had a visible central vein in their liver sections, while lupus- induced mice showed pathological changes in their liver sections.Predniso- lone treatment resulted in mild steatosis in males and severe steatosis in females.Methotrexate- treated mice had severe vacuolation in females and mild steatosis and severe necrosis in males.Vitamin E treatment showed no signs of injury in lupus- induced mice (figure 12).
Effect of drug treatments on spleen sections Light micrographs from the normal control groups displayed a clear spleen section with distinct white and red pulp. The negative control groups experienced splenic rupture with a more prominent red pulp than white pulp.Prednisolone- treated groups exhibited giant Figure 11 Representative mice kidney cortex sections stained with H&E (×100 magnification).(A) Normal control male mice.(B) Negative control male mice.(C) Prednsiolone- treated male mice.(D) Methotrexate- treated male mice.(E) Vitamin E 25mg/ kg treated male mice.(F) Vitamin E 50mg/kg treated male mice.(G) Normal control female mice.(H) Negative control female mice.(I) Prednsiolone- treated female mice.(J) Methotrexate- treated female mice.(K) Vitamin E 25mg/kg treated female mice.(L) Vitamin E 50mg/kg treated female mice.Scale bar 50 µm.

A number of studies have demonstrated the antipro- liferative action of methotrexate that decreases immune cell population.20 21 The kidneys are heavily impacted in this study. It is important to note that the mechanisms of kidney damage in hydralazine- induced lupus, like in other forms of lupus, are complex and multifactorial.Autoan- tibodies produced in response to hydralazine- induced lupus can directly target components of the kidney, such as antigens on the surface of kidney cells.This can lead to antibody- mediated damage to kidney tissues.22 Mice that received methotrexate had severe damage to the kidney and liver, while the mice group that received predniso- lone had injury to the heart.Vitamin E did not prevent injury on the kidney and liver at a lower dose, but did protect from pathology in all organs at a higher dose.
Prior research has indicated a connection between meth- otrexate and hepatotoxicity.23 Corticosteroids such as prednisolone increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases in people suffering from autoimmune diseases.24 Other studies have found deterioration of myocardial function after steroid treatment.25 The study showed that mice treated with prednisolone had a slightly higher mean body weight compared with the other treatment groups. Steroids have been shown to increase appetite leading to potential weight gain.26 Limitations This study highlights vitamin E’s potential benefits in a hydralazine- induced lupus model but presents limitations: ►This model may not precisely replicate human SLE, making direct application to humans challenging due to species- specific differences.►Dosages and treatment duration might not align with clinical practices, necessitating further investigations for optimal therapeutic approaches.
►Focusing on single treatments may not fully represent the complexity of real- world SLE management. ►The relatively small sample size may limit broader applicability, requiring larger cohorts for more reli- able results.Given these constraints, it is vital to interpret the find- ings cautiously.Further research, including clinical trials and mechanistic studies, is necessary to evaluate the clin- ical relevance and safety of these treatments for people with SLE.CONCLUSION In this mouse model, vitamin E demonstrated a signifi- cant attenuation of the induced autoimmune lupus- like disease.These findings suggest potential immunomod- ulatory effects of vitamin E in lupus- like conditions.However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this study, and further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms involved and to assess the appli- cability of these findings to human autoimmune diseases, including SLE.
The researchers suggest examining the ideal dose of vitamin E to eliminate hydrogen peroxide radicals and other free radicals that cause SLE.
