Mice lacking a critical liver iron–trafﬁcking protein also manifest steatosis because of iron-mediated oxidative damage and are protected from liver disease by oral vit E supplements.Objectives: We aimed to examine the role of dietary vit E supplementation in modulating iron-sensing regulatory systems and nonheme iron levels in mouse liver. Methods: C57Bl/6 male mice, aged 6 wk, were fed puri ﬁed diets containing normal amounts of iron and either control (45 mg/kg) or elevated (450 mg/kg) levels of 2R- α-tocopherol (vit E) for 18 d.Mouse plasma and liver were analyzed for nonheme iron, levels and activity of iron homeostatic proteins, and markers of oxidative stress.We compared means /C6SD for iron and oxidative stress parameters between mice fed the control diet and those fed the vit E diet.Results: The Vit E –fed mice exhibited lower levels of liver nonheme iron (38% reduction, P<0.0001) and ferritin (74% reduction, P<0.01) than control-fed mice.
The levels of liver mRNA for transferrin receptor 1 and divalent metal transporter 1 were reduced to 42% and 57% of the control, respectively. The mRNA levels for targets of nuclear factor erythroid 2 –related factor (Nrf2), a major regulator of the oxidative stress response and iron-responsive genes, were also suppressed in vit E livers.Hepcidin, an iron regulatory hormone, levels werelower in the plasma ( P<0.05), and ferroportin (FPN), the iron exporter regulated by hepcidin, was expressed at higher levels in the liver (P<0.05).Conclusions: Oral vit E supplementation in mice can lead to depletion of liver iron stores by suppressing the iron- and redox-sensing transcription factor Nrf2, leading to enhanced iron ef ﬂux through liver FPN.Iron depletion may indirectly enhance the antioxidative effects of vit E.
Keywords : ferroportin, bone morphogenetic protein, hepcidin, iron homeostasis, ferroptosis Introduction One hundred years ago, vitamin E (vit E) was discovered to be an essential nutrient in animals. Since then, researchers and clinicians have investigated its metabolic activities that may promote health and prevent diseases.Similar to most nutrients,vit E has the capacity to both heal and harm, and its moleculareffects are not completely understood.Vit E ( α-tocopherol) is a lipophilic antioxidant and a radical scavenging agent present in membranes throughout the body [ 1].PUFAs present in mem- brane phospholipids are subject to oxidative damage fromendogenously produced reactive oxygen species (ROS).
As anantioxidant, vit E can chemically terminate the propagation oflipid peroxyl radicals that form in PUFAs, thus limiting the Abbreviations: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; DMT1 , divalent metal transporter 1; FPN, ferroportin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; IHC, immunohistochemistry; IRE, iron regulatory element; IRP, iron regulatory protein; LSEC, liver sinusoidal endothelial cell; NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; NAS H, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; NCOA4, nuclear coactivator 4; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor; PCBP1, poly-rC –binding protein 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Tfr1, transferrin receptor 1. * Corresponding author.E-mail address: carolinep@mail.nih.gov (C.C.Philpott).journal homepage: https://jn.nutrition.org/ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2023.04.018 Received 8 March 2023; Received in revised form 14 April 2023; Accepted 27 April 2023; Available online 29 April 2023 0022-3166/Published by Elsevier Inc.
on behalf of American Society for Nutrition.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1866 –1876 damage to membranes caused by endogenously produced ROS [2]. Although overt vit E de ﬁciency is rare, it is clearly associated with a form of ataxia, which is caused by the death of Purkinjecells of the cerebellum [ 3].Deﬁciency may also be associated with retinopathy and impaired immune function [ 4].Despite the rarity of vit E de ﬁciency, studies on cells and animals have suggested that the antioxidant activity of vit E can affect numerous physiologic processes, especially those associatedwith oxidative stress, such as atherosclerosis, in ﬂammation, and cancer.For this reason, clinical studies examined the effects ofsupplemental vit E on the primary prevention and treatment ofdisease.
Unfortunately, large controlled clinical trials failed todemonstrate bene ﬁcial effects of vit E on CVD [ 5–9] or the incidence of cancer, and vit E supplementation may be associ-ated with an increased risk of prostate cancer [ 10]. Although clinical research studies do not provide evidence that supple-mentation with vit E alone prevents macular degeneration, supplementation with a mixture of antioxidant vitamins (including vit E) and minerals may delay progression [ 11,12].Similarly, although vit E supplements had no effect on the pro-gression of cognitive decline, they may slow down functionaldecline in early Alzheimer disease [ 13,14].Clinical data also support a role of vit E in the treatment of fatty liver disease.Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is ahighly prevalent disorder, characterized by the accumulation ofintrahepatic triglycerides (steatosis), which is frequently asso-ciated with overnutrition, obesity, and abnormal glucose meta-bolism.
NAFLD can progress to a more serious in ﬂammatory liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associ- ated with hepatocyte necrosis, ﬁbrosis, and cirrhosis, leading to overt hepatic failure and an increased risk of hepatocellularcarcinoma. ROS produced in the liver are thought to contributeto the progression of NAFLD to NASH, and recent evidence hassuggested that ROS also drives lipogenesis at the heart of bothdisorders [ 15].In randomized controlled trials, vit E treatment in patients with NASH was effective in reducing in ﬂammation and steatosis [ 16] and improving transplant-free survival [ 17].In a study including patients with NAFL and NASH, vit E improvedsteatosis and ALT by limiting de novo lipogenesis [ 18].However, in a mouse model of diet-induced NAFLD, vit E did not improve or prevent liver disease [ 19].Liver iron contributes to the oxidative damage caused by ROS.
Reduced iron (Fe 2þ) can chemically react with endoge- nously produced hydrogen peroxide or lipid hydroperoxide,forming hydroxyl radical or lipid peroxyl radicals, respectively.Excess iron accumulation is associated with chronic liver disease,both in primary iron loading diseases (e.g., genetic hemochro-matosis and transfusion-associated iron overload) [ 20] and secondarily in chronic in ﬂammatory diseases of the liver (e.g., hepatitis C and NASH) [ 21]. A recent study examining the role of the iron chaperone, poly rC –binding protein 1 (PCBP1), in the mouse liver found that deletion of PCBP1 was associated withdysregulated iron balance, oxidative damage to hepatocytes,mitochondrial dysfunction, steatosis, and hepatocyte death dueto unchaperoned iron.Treating these animals with areduced-iron diet both lowered the levels of iron in the liver andimproved the oxidative damage and steatosis.
Similarly, dietarysupplementation with the lipophilic antioxidants vit E [ 22]o r coenzyme Q [ 23] ameliorated the iron-mediated oxidative damage, steatosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting aninteraction between oxidative stress and iron homeostasis. Here, we hypothesized that vit E alters the iron regulatory systemsin healthy wild-type mice and found that it produces liveriron depletion, which may contribute to the antioxidant effectsof vit E.Methods Animals Wild-type mice are from the C57Bl/6 background carrying PCBP1 ﬂanked by loxP sites that are phenotypically indistin- guishable from the C57Bl/6 parent strain [ 24].LoxP sites are short 34-bp sequences of DNA that are neither transcribed nortranslated.In the absence of a Cre recombinase, these sequencesremain quiescent in the genome [ 25].The loxP sites located on either end of the PCBP1 locus do not alter mRNA levels, expression, or regulation of the gene [ 24].
Wild-type male lit- termates were weaned at 21 d of age onto puri ﬁed diets (based on AIN-76A, 2R- α-tocopherol at 45 mg/kg) containing normal levels of iron (48-ppm iron citrate, Envigo TD.80394; controldiet) or with 48-ppm iron citrate and 10-fold enriched for vit E (2R α-tocopherol at 450 mg/kg, Envigo TD.180021; vit E diet). All wild-type male mice from a single litter were placed on thesame diet (control or vit E).Because male and female mice differsigniﬁcantly in their tissue and blood iron parameters, they must be studied and analyzed separately.Because litter sizes wereunequal and a single mouse did not yield suf ﬁcient tissue sam- ples for all assays, multiple litters were placed on each diet andsample numbers for individual assays vary.A minimum of 7 micewere used per assay, and the mouse numbers are indicated in theﬁgure legends.Mice had ad libitum access to diets and double-distilled water and were euthanized after 16 to 18 d on the diets (age: 5 –6 wk).
Blood, liver, and spleen tissue were collected promptly at euthanasia. The liver and spleen tissuewere divided, and the samples were snap frozen in liquid nitro-gen, immersed in an RNA stabilization solution (RNAlater,Thermo ﬁsher), or ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde.The frozen samples were maintained at /C080 /C14C until use.All animal study protocols were reviewed and approved by the NIDDK AnimalCare and Use Committee and performed in compliance with NIHguidelines for humane care of animals.Cell culture Huh7 human hepatoma cells were grown in Dulbecco ’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100-U/mL penicillin G, and 100- μg/mL streptomycin.2R α-tocopherol (#T3251, Sigma) was diluted in absolute ethanol to 1 mol/L(stock) and diluted in ethanol again to 400 mM before adding itto media at 400 μM.Cells were grown to 40% con ﬂuency before changing to media with or without vit E (400 μMα-tocopherol) and incubated for 16 h at 37/C14C and 5% CO 2.
Fluorescence immunohistochemistry Fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ferroportin (FPN) was performed on ﬁxed, deparaf ﬁnized mouse liver sec- tions. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the sections inantigen retrieval citrate buffer (pH 6.0, Sigma) for 5 min.Sec-tions were blocked in 5% donkey serum/PBS for 1 h and thenincubated in 1:667 in rat α-FPN (gift from Dr Elizabeta Nemeth,E.Baratz et al.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1866 –1876 1867 University of California) and 5% donkey serum/0.1% Triton X- 100/PBS overnight at 4/C14C.After PBS washes, sections were incubated in Alexa Fluor 555 –labeled goat antirat antibody at 1:500 (ab 150158, Abcam) for 1 h.After washing, the sectionswere mounted (Fluorogel II with DAPI, EMS) and imaged using aconfocal microscope (Zeiss LSM700).Sections from each animal incubated in buffer without antibody served as negative controls for background signal subtraction.
Blood analysis Blood was collected immediately after euthanasia via cardiac puncture using syringes and tubes pretreated with heparin. Plasma was separated using plasma separation tubes (PST) withlithium heparin (BD).Plasma iron was measured by 2 chromo-genic methods using either acid precipitation [ 21] or ascorbate reduction (Fe slide analyzer, Vitros Chemistry Systems) followedby ferrozine chelation as the chromogen.Both methods yieldedequivalent results.Whole blood was analyzed using the IDEXXProCyte Dx Hematology Analyzer.Western blot analysis The frozen mouse liver was dounce-homogenized in 20 vol- umes (ml/g tissue) of modi ﬁed radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (EMD Millipore) with 0.25% SDS, 1.0mMDTT (Sigma), and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Di-agnostics).Lysates were sonicated twice for 20 s using theUP200St Ultrasonicator (Heischler) at 100-W power.Samples were centrifuged at 4 /C14C and 2500 /C2gfor 5 min and then at 10,000 /C2gfor 10 min.
Lysates were denatured at 95/C14C for 5 min in 1.3 /C2lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc)—2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol —prior to SDS- PAGE. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes,stained with REVERT total protein stain (LICOR), and imaged.After washing the protein stain with reversal solution (LICOR),membranes were blocked in 5% milk/PBS for 1 h and thenincubated with the primary antibody (antiferritin, F5012;Sigma) anti-ARA70 (NCOA4, Bethyl Laboratories; A302-272A)and anti-GAPDH (MAB374, EMD Millipore) diluted in antibody diluent (Life Technologies) overnight at 4 /C14C.IR dye –labeled secondary antibodies (LICOR) were used for 1 h at 1:10,000.After washing, the membranes were imaged at 700-nm and 800-nm wavelengths (LICOR Odyssey).For quanti ﬁcation, protein bands of interest were normalized to the total protein signal.
FPNimmunoblotting was performed using rabbit antimouse FPNantibody (MTP11-A, Alpha Diagnostics) and horseradish perox-idase (HRP)-conjugated donkey antirabbit (NA 934, SigmaAldrich). qPCR analysis RNA from liver samples and Huh7 cells was extracted using the TRIzol Plus RNA Puri ﬁcation Kit, as described in the manu- facturer ’s manual (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc).RNA was reverse transcribed using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit(Applied Biosystems).The PCR reactions were setup using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc) and performed using the Applied Biosystem 7500 Real Time PCRsystem.Transcripts were quanti ﬁed using the ΔΔCT method.All measurements are normalized to actin.Primers sequences arelisted in Table 1 ; primers for glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (GCLC) were predesigned (KSPQ12012G, Sigma).
Nonheme liver and spleen iron measurement Frozen liver or spleen samples were weighed and suspended in 5 volumes of acid solution (3M hydrogen chloride and 0.61Mtrichloroacetic acid) and incubated at 65 /C14C for 72 h. The su- pernatant was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 /C2gfor 5 min.Each sample (at 10 –40μL) was transferred to a 96-well plate, followed by the addition of 165 μL of chromogen work- ing buffer: 1 volume chromogen stock reagent, 5 volumes satu-rated sodium acetate (9.3 M), and 5 volumes of water.Thechromogen stock reagent contains 1.86mM bathophenanthro-line sulfonate and 143mM thioglycolic acid in water.Absorbance is measured at 535 nm.Iron concentration is expressed as mi- crograms of iron per gram of wet tissue [ 26].Iron analysis of the vit E diet was performed on pulverized food pellets, followed byacid digestion and chromogenic detection, as described above.
Liver α-tocopherol measurement α-Tocopherol was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/MS, as described previously [ 27–29] with modi ﬁcations [ 30,31].

The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1866 –1876 1868 ice-cold PBS (100 μL for 30 mg of tissue) and diluted 1:1 with ice-cold water.Three hundred microliters of ice-cold ethanol(200 proof) with 0.5% butylated hydroxytoluene (wt:vol) and 1 μM of d6- α-tocopherol (internal standards) was added to the sample, which was vortexed for 1 min, followed by addition of600 μL of ice-cold hexane.Each sample was vortexed again for 1 min, and 400 μL of the upper phase was transferred to a new tube and dried using speedVac (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc).The dried material was resuspended in 50 μL of methanol and 0.5% butylated hydroxytoluene (wt/vol).α-Tocopherol was analyzed by HPLC/MS using a single quadrupole instrument (Agilent 6130MS).For separation, an Agilent 1200 system was used with aSupelcosil LC-18 Column.The mobile phase consisted of 95%methanol.
For quanti ﬁcation, Agilent Single Quadrupole 6130 coupled with electrospray ionisation (ESI) was used in negativemode, and for single-ion recording detection, mass-to-chargeratio (m/z) data were obtained for d0- α-tocopherol [m/z: 429] and d6- α-tocopherol [m/z: 435]. Plasma hepcidin ELISA ELISA for hepcidin in mouse plasma samples was performed using the Hepcidin Murine-complete ELISA kit (Intrinsic Life-sciences, HMC-001).Plasma samples collected from mice onnecropsy as previously described were frozen at /C080 /C14C and later thawed for use in the competitive, monoclonal colorimetricassay.Brie ﬂy, plasma samples were incubated in a microwell plate coated with hepcidin antibody before the addition ofstreptavidin-conjugated HRP.The amount of hepcidin bound bythe antibody was then quanti ﬁed by the addition of 3,3 0,5,50- tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the HRP substrate.Colorimetric measurements were taken at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
IRP–iron regulatory element binding assay IRP–iron regulatory element (IRE) binding activity was analyzed using the biotinylated-IRE method. The 30-bio- tinylated –IRE probe (Euro ﬁns Scienti ﬁc) had the following sequence: 50-GGAGUUCCUGCUUCAACAGUGCUUGGACGGAACUCC-30.A mutated IRE probe was used as a negative control with the sequence: 50-GGAGUUCCUGCUUCAAAGUG CUUGGACGGAACUCC-30.For the assay, aliquots of IRE probes were incubated at 95/C14Cf o r 1 min and then cooled down to room temperature for anneal-ing the hairpin structure.Biotinylated-IRE probes (5 pmol) were incubated with Streptavidin-coupled DynaBeads M280 (100 μg, ThermoFisher) for 20 min on a shaker to form probe/ b e a dc o m p l e x e sa n dt h e nw a s h e d3t i m e sw i t hl y s i sb u f f e r(40mM KC1, 25mM Tris-C1 [pH: 7.5], 1% Triton X-100).
IREprobe/bead complexes were added to tissue lysates (100 μg) prepared with lysis buffer supplemented with 1 /C2Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc), 1mM DTT, and 20-U/mL RNase Inhibitor (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc). After shaking for 20 min at room temperature, the probe/bead/IRPcomplexes were magnetically isolated, washed with lysisbuffer 3 times, and then resuspended in 100 μLo f1 /C2NuPage LDS loading buffer with 50mM DTT.The samples were incu- bated at 95/C14Cf o r5m i n ,a n dt h e n ,2 5 μLw a sl o a d e do n4 %t o 12% Bis –Tris gels for quantitative immunoblotting of IRP1 and IRP2.The rabbit anti-IRP1 antibody was prepared against N-terminal 16 amino acids of IRP1, and the rabbit anti-IRP2antibody was prepared against amino acids 137 to 209 of human IRP2.Secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugateddonkey antirabbit antibodies (NA 934, Sigma Aldrich).Im-munoblots were analyzed by densitometry using LICOR.
Quanti ﬁcation and statistical analysis Fluorescent images were processed and analyzed using Fiji (ImageJ version: 2.0.0-rc-49/1.51d). Data were analyzed withPrism 8 (GraphPad).The data are reported as means /C6SD.Outliers were identi ﬁed using the integrated Robust regression and Outlier removal (ROUT) method and excluded.Differencesbetween 2 groups were analyzed using unpaired t-tests, with Welch correction for unequal variance.The asterisk (*) indicatesdifference from control: * P<0.05; ** P<0.01; *** P<0.001, and **** P<0.0001.Results Vit E treatment induces liver iron de ﬁciency in mice To test the interaction between iron homeostasis and oxida- tive stress, we measured iron parameters in wild-type mice fed either the control or vit E –enriched diet.
Three-week-old wild- type male mice were placed on either a control diet containingnormal levels of iron (puri ﬁed diet with 48-ppm added iron and 45-mg/kg α-tocopherol) or an identical diet enriched with vit E (α-tocopherol, 450 mg/kg) for 16 to 18 d ( Figure 1 A). Vit E treatment signi ﬁcantly decreased the levels of liver iron in the wild-type mouse to 62% of the levels found on the control diet(Figure 1 B).Similarly, spleen iron levels trended lower in the vit E–treated mice, although this difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance ( P¼0.058).We con ﬁrmed that mice fed the vit E diet accumulated elevated levels of vit E in the liver by directly measuring α-tocopherol and ﬁnding a 48-fold increase in the livers of the vit E –fed mice ( Figure 1 C).These results suggested a possible direct impact of vit E on iron homeostasis in mice.
To con ﬁrm that depletion of liver iron stores affected hepa- tocyte iron metabolism, we tested the levels of both the ironstorage protein ferritin and the ferritinophagy receptor NCOA4,which selectively targets ferritin for degradation [ 32,33], as cellular iron depletion promotes accumulation of NCOA4 anddegradation of ferritin [ 34,35]. The decrease in nonheme iron in the livers of vit E –fed mice was concordant with immunoblotting analyses showing decreased levels of ferritin (0.36 of the control diet).Accordingly, NCOA4 levels were 1.6-fold elevated in the livers of vit E –fed mice ( Figure 1 D).The liver iron parameters indicated that mice fed on a high vit E diet experienced liver iron depletion.To con ﬁrm that the above iron measures were directly affected by dietary vit E andnot changes due to feeding behavior or overt liver disease, wemeasured mouse body and liver weights at necropsy.
We foundthat body weights ( Figure 1 E) did not differ between the control and vit E-diet –fed mice, suggesting no signi ﬁcant changes in feeding behavior or the onset of liver disease based on diet. Wefurther con ﬁrmed, via direct iron assay, that the iron contents in the control and vit E diets were both 50 ppm (data not shown), indicating that changes in liver iron stores were also not causedby reduced dietary iron intake in the vit E –fed mice.Complete blood count measurements were assessed to determine whether changes to the liver iron content affectedE.Baratz et al.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1866 –1876 1869 erythropoiesis.The RBC count, hemoglobin, and mean corpus- cular volume values were not different in mice fed the vit E dietcompared to the control ( Figure 1 F).Thus, vit E treatment selectively decreased liver iron stores but did not limit erythro-poiesis in these mice.
Vit E activates IRP1 but not IRP2 in hepatocytes We tested whether the cell-autonomous iron regulatory sys- tem could account for the changes in liver iron on the vit E diet.Cellular iron balance is controlled by the IRP/IRE system. IRP1and IRP2 are RNA-binding proteins that function by binding toIREs in the 5 0and 30untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, thereby regulating mRNA translation and stability,respectively [ 36].In response to low cellular iron, IRP1 and IRP2 bind to IREs in the 3 0UTR of the iron-import genes transferrin receptor 1 ( Tfr1) and divalent metal transporter 1 ( DMT1 ), which may facilitate mRNA stability, protein expression, and iron up-take.We measured the IRP –IRE binding activity based on the quantitative immunoprecipitation of biotin-labeled IRE withbound IRP, followed by immunoblot analysis of bound IRP.
Inaccordance with the iron-depleted status of the livers of vit E –fed mice, the IRP1 –IRE binding activity was increased by 1.7-fold in liver lysates of these mice ( Figure 2 A), whereas the total IRP1 protein levels were not different. However, unlike IRP1,IRP2–IRE binding activity and IRP2 protein levels were not different between the control- and vit E-diet –fed mice (Figure 2 B).We evaluated transcript levels of the IRE target genes Tfr1andDMT1 .DMT1 has both an iron-responsive, 3 0UTR IRE form [DMT1( þIRE)] and a form without an IRE [DMT1(-IRE)] [ 37].The expression of both Tfr1 and DMT1( þIRE) was signi ﬁcantly reduced in mice fed the vit E diet compared with that in mice fed the control diet (40% and 45% ofthe control, respectively; Figure 2 C [left and center]), whereas the non-IRE form of DMT1 was not changed by diet ( Figure 2 C, right).We con ﬁrmed these vit E –dependent decreases in IRP target genes in Huh7 cells.
Huh7 cells were incubated overnight in media with or without 400 μM of vit E. Vit E treatment decreased the mRNA levels of Tfr1 to 42% of control and of DMT1( þIRE) to 57% of control ( Figure 2 D, left and center), whereas DMT1(-IRE) was not affected ( Figure 2 D, right).Because the increase in IRE binding activity measured in FIGURE 1.Iron de ﬁciency in the liver of vitamin E (vit E) –treated mice.Timeline of mouse treatments with different diets (A).Wild-type male littermates were weaned at 3 wk of age and placed on control or vit E ( 2Rα-tocopherol, 450 mg/kg) diets for 16 to 18 d before analysis.Decreased nonheme iron in the liver and spleen of wild-type mice fed a vit E –supplemented diet (B).The liver (left) or spleen (right) tissue was acid digested and nonheme iron measured based on chromogen absorbance.Increased liver vit E levels in mice fed the vit E diet.α-tocopherol was extracted from liver tissue and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (C).

The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1866 –1876 1870 Figure 2 A (top) would be predicted to increase the levels of Tfr1 and DMT1 transcripts rather than decrease levels of these tran- scripts, as measured in Figure 2 C, D, we did not attribute the vit E–induced changes in liver iron to the cell-autonomous regula- tory system and instead evaluated the systemic iron regulatorysystems. Vit E suppresses the activity of the BMP –hepcidin –FPN regulatory axis Hepcidin is the principal iron regulatory hormone in mam- mals and the major regulator of systemic iron homeostasis.Itfunctions by inhibiting the iron ef ﬂux pump FPN and thereby controls iron release into the systemic circulation [ 20].Hepcidin expression is controlled transcriptionally through multiple reg-ulatory signals that primarily arise from the liver sinusoidalendothelium in the form of secreted paracrine factors: the bonemorphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 2 and 6 [ 38].
Recent studies have indicated that iron-regulated BMP transcription iscontrolled in part by an oxidation-sensitive transcription factor:nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) [ 39]. We evaluated the activity of Nrf2 by measuring the expression of Nrf2 target genes in mice fed the vit E diet.The mRNA levels of FIGURE 2.Vitamin E (vit E) alters the activity of liver iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) and levels of iron-regulated transcripts.Increased IRP1–IRE binding in livers of mice fed the vit E diet (A).IRP1 activity was analyzed by pull down of IRP1 bound to biotin-labeled IRE.Repre- sentative immunoblots of liver lysates for the IRP1 pull down and input (left) as well as quanti ﬁcation (right).Representative immunoblots of liver lysates for the IRP2 pulldown and input (left) as well as quanti ﬁcation (right) (B).The same samples and membranes were used in (A) and (B).Ponceau stain for total protein.

Baratz et al.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1866 –1876 1871 Nrf2 target GCLC [ 40] was decreased to 30% of control in the livers of mice fed on high vit E ( Figure 3 A), con ﬁrming the ca- pacity of the vit E diet to suppress Nrf2 activity.FPN, which is transcriptionally regulated by Nrf2 in macrophages and brainendothelial cells [ 41,42], was also found to be downregulated to 47% of control in the livers of vit E –fed mice.Consistent with this reduced Nrf2 activity, transcripts of both BMPs were shown toregulate hepcidin, BMP6 and BMP2, and displayed reducedexpression in livers of mice fed the vit E diet.Transcripts ofBMP6 decreased to 50% of control in vit E –treated livers.BMP2 transcript levels were more variable and displayed a trend todecrease.
This trend is consistent with previous studies thatdemonstrated that iron regulates BMP2 transcription to a lesser extent than BMP6 [ 43]. In hepatocytes, activation of the BMP receptor results in activation of Smad4-dependent transcription [ 44].Thedownstream targets of BMP2 and BMP6 in hepatocytes include ID1 [ 45,46], which was decreased to 46% of the control in livers of vit E –fed mice ( Figure 3 B, left).However, the levels of the BMP target HAMP1 , which encodes hepcidin, did not change (Figure 3 B, right), suggesting that other factors can affect HAMP1 transcription in vit E mice.Therefore, we directly measured hepcidin levels in mouse plasma and found that they were signi ﬁcantly reduced to 56% of control in the plasma of mice fed the vit E diet relative to that in the plasma od mice fedthe control diet ( Figure 4 A).Hepcidin regulates iron export by binding to FPN and trig- gering its internalization and degradation [ 20].
Thus, plasma membrane levels of FPN re ﬂect both hepcidin levels and iron efﬂux activity. Fluorescence IHC of liver sections from mice fed the vit E diet showed an increased signal for FPN along plasmamembranes and sinusoids compared to control livers ( Figure 4 B).Similarly, increased FPN staining was detectable in liver sections of mice fed an iron-de ﬁcient diet (~5 ppm Fe), which also trig- gers reduced plasma hepcidin levels.FPN IHC data wereconﬁrmed with quantitative FPN immunoblotting, which demonstrated a 2.7-fold increase in FPN protein levels in liverstreated with vit E ( Figure 4 C).We questioned whether the augmented FPN protein levels and predicted iron export activityfrom the liver affected plasma iron levels.A 23% increase inplasma iron levels was detected in the animals that were fed thevit E diet when compared to the control diet ( Figure 4 D).
Together, these data suggest that vit E indirectly repressed theactivity of the Nrf2 –BMP–hepcidin regulatory axis and resulted in FPN accumulation and increased iron export from the livers of mice fed the vit E diet ( Figure 4 E). Discussion Our recent studies demonstrated that vit E treatment pre- vented oxidative damage in livers of mice depleted of the ironchaperone PCBP1 [ 22,23].Although those effects and the effects of coenzyme Q could be attributed to the direct radical-trapping,antioxidative activity of these agents, they could also re ﬂect changes in the regulation and reactivity of cellular iron pools[22,23].Here, we further explored the effect of vit E on cellular and systemic iron homeostasis.We found that dietary supple-mentation with vit E led to liver and spleen iron depletion, likelythrough the alteration of the BMP –hepcidin –FPN regulatory axis.
Our data support previous studies that reported increased levels of labile iron in multiple tissues from vit E –deﬁcient rats [ 47]. The cell-autonomous regulatory system of IRP1/IRP2 was examined but did not account for the vit E –induced changes in iron-related gene expression.The enhanced IRP1 –IRE binding activity in vit E livers is consistent with the known sensitivity ofIRP1 to oxidative damage, which is likely suppressed by vit E.The absence of changes in IRP2, which is the IRP primarilyinvolved in mediating IRE binding in the liver [ 48,49], suggests that the IRP/IRE system was not signi ﬁcantly perturbed by the changes in liver iron produced by vit E.Reduction in the levels ofTfR1 and DMT1 transcripts by vit E in both liver and Huh cells suggests that a redox-mediated signal could account for these changes.
Although these genes are not known to be direct targetsof Nrf2, an indirect mechanism involving vit E –mediated signaling through another transcription factor is a possibility[50].FIGURE 3.

Baratz et al.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1866 –1876 1872 Systemic iron regulatory systems, however, did account for the vit E –induced reduction in liver iron.Hepcidin is the master regulator of iron homeostasis in animals.It is a small peptidehormone synthesized and secreted in response to elevated serumiron levels.Circulating plasma hepcidin binds to FPN on thesurface of iron-exporting cells, which blocks ef ﬂux and triggers the internalization and degradation of FPN [ 20].Because hepa- tocytes and macrophages of the liver are major sites of ironstorage and ef ﬂux, changing hepcidin levels regulates the level of hepatic iron.Hepcidin is synthesized in many cell types, and synthesis is regulated by multiple circulating factors.
The major site of hepcidin synthesis and secretion is the liver, where thesecreted factors Bmp 6 and 2 activate Bmp receptors on thesurface of hepatocytes, triggering intracellular Smad signals thatstimulate hepcidin transcription [ 44]. We found that vit E treatment results in the suppression of Bmp6 transcription and,to a lesser extent, Bmp2 in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs).This effect is likely mediated by the suppression of theredox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2, which has been shownto regulate Bmp transcription in LSECs [ 39].Nrf2 is activated in response to oxidative stress and stimulates the transcription ofmore than 1000 genes that comprise the antioxidant defense[51].The activity of NRF2 is proposed to be stimulated by ROS arising from mitochondria; however, recent studies have alsosuggested that oxidized lipids and the propagation of lipid per-oxyl radicals activate NRF2 as well [ 52–54].
Vit E may suppress NRF2 activation by inhibiting the production of the oxidized lipids that activate NRF2 [ 53]. We measured lower levels of BMP6 and BMP2 transcripts in vit E livers than in controls ( Figure 3 A).Lower levels of BMP2 and BMP6 clearly reduced the activation of the BMP receptorand intracellular Smad signaling pathway in hepatocytes, as the FIGURE 4.Decreased plasma hepcidin and increased liver ferroportin (FPN) in mice fed a vitamin E (vit E) diet.Decreased plasma hepcidin levels in mice fed the vit E diet.Plasma hepcidin measured using ELISA (A).Increased FPN on plasma and sinusoidal membranes in the liver of vit E –fed mice (B).Representative images of liver ﬂuorescent immunohistochemistry using antiferroportin antibody.Representative image from a mouse fed a low-iron diet included as a positive control.Arrows indicate the FPN signal on plasma membranes and sinusoids.Increased FPN in livers from vit E–fed mice (C).

Baratz et al.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1866 –1876 1873 BMP-responsive gene ID1was expressed at only 50% of control levels in the vit E –fed mice.Furthermore, the levels of circulating plasma hepcidin were also reduced to 56% of control.Yet, theHAMP mRNA levels in the liver were not found to be suppressed, even though the circulating plasma hepcidin levels werereduced.HAMP mRNA levels in the liver are typically closely correlated with circulating hepcidin levels.
This apparent discrepancy could be due to temporal shifts in iron-sensing andhepcidin transcription, as both liver hepcidin transcripts andserum hepcidin levels spike over a relatively short time span(minutes to hours) in response to iron and in ﬂammatory signals [55–57]. Additionally, vit E may elicit a variety of regulatory responses that are integrated at the level of the hepatocyte.Forexample, suppression of Nrf2 activity by vit E may also accountfor the reduced level of FPN transcripts in the liver.Yet, weshowed, using both immunohistochemical staining and immu-noblotting, that FPN protein levels are elevated in the liver.These data indicate that ultimately, it is the level of circulating hepcidin that controls the expression and activity of FPN in theliver, which likely accounts for the enhanced ef ﬂux of iron that results in lower liver and spleen iron ( Figure 1 B) and higher plasma iron levels ( Figure 4 E).
Lower levels of intracellular iron may enhance the antioxidant properties of vit E Vit E has been shown to reduce the levels of oxidative stress that drive lipogenesis and disease progression of NAFLD andNASH in patients [ 16,18]. Vit E has also been shown to reduce the steatosis and oxidative damage caused by unchaperoned ironin a mouse model of fatty liver disease [ 22].Anemia has been reported as a side effect of vit E therapy and was attributed tooccult gastrointestinal blood loss [ 18], as vit E may inhibit platelet aggregation and coagulation [ 58–60].Our studies sug- gest that vit E therapy results in altered regulation of intrinsiciron homeostatic systems.Although anemia is not a desiredoutcome of therapy, depletion of iron in hepatocytes maycontribute to the bene ﬁcial antioxidative effects of vit E therapy in NAFLD and NASH [ 16,18].
Because labile ferrous iron in the cytosol of hepatocytes can directly catalyze the formation ofhydroxyl and lipid peroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide andPUFAs, lowering the levels of ferrous iron will also limit oxygenand lipid radical formation and lessen oxidative damage tolipids. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death pathway, maycontribute to the hepatocyte cell death observed in patients with NAFLD and NASH [ 61].Vit E may limit ferroptosis in patients by both directly suppressing the oxidative damage to lipids andreducing the iron-catalyzed production of oxygen and lipidradicals in the liver.The levels of iron and hepcidin in the liver may be altered in a variety of chronic liver diseases; however, vit E supplementationmay speci ﬁcally bene ﬁt iron dysregulation associated with NAFLD.Hepatic iron overload with low hepcidin levels is asso-ciated with chronic liver disease of various etiologies.
Mutationsin multiple iron regulatory genes ( HFE,HJV,Tfr2,o r HAMP ) cause the iron overload of hereditary hemochromatosis through production of inappropriately low levels of hepcidin [ 57]. Iron overload with low serum hepcidin is also observed in chronicliver diseases that are not associated with genetic alterations,such as alcoholic liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, autoim-mune liver disease, and cirrhosis [ 62,63].Several studies havereported liver iron loading with inappropriately low serum hepcidin levels in patients with chronic hepatitis C viral in-fections [ 64].However, both liver iron and hepcidin levels were increased in subsets of patients with NAFLD [ 21,65–67].The beneﬁcial effect of vit E treatment in patients with NAFLD [ 18] might be due to several mechanisms, including suppression of liver hepcidin, iron levels, oxidative damage, and in ﬂammation.
Ourﬁndings of the effects of vit E supplementation on iron ho- meostasis in the healthy mouse model are complementary tohuman studies and point toward the possible additional thera-peutic effects of this dietary supplement.
