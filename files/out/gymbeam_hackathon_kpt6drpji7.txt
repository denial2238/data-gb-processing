280 © 2024 Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research | Published by Wolters Kluwer - MedknowIntroduction Postpartum Depression (PPD) is a prevalent and severe mental health disorder that can have enduring effects on both the mother and the baby.[1] Depressed mothers experience feelings of sadness, fatigue, guilt, worthlessness, and anxiety as they take on the parental role, and may even have thoughts of harming themselves or the baby.[2] Sadly, many depressed mothers do not seek medical attention in time due to the stigma surrounding mental illness.[3] Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment can be challenging.PPD prevalence ranges from 0.5% to 60.8% globally.[4] In Iran, about one‑third of mothers experience PPD.[5] Risk factors include lack of support from a spouse, economic and social factors, previous psychiatric disorders, pregnancy complications, and domestic violence.[6‑8] Inadequate nutrition may also contribute to Address for correspondence: Dr.

Our search was based on the keywords “postpartum depression” and “nutrition, vitamin D, Folic acid, iron, zinc, and vitamins.” We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‑Analyses (PRISMA) checklist to select articles based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of the 100 articles identified, only 24 articles met our criteria and were selected for further analysis.Results: Research suggests that low levels of vitamin D, iron, folate, and carbohydrates, and an unhealthy diet lacking in vegetables are potential causes of PPD.However, the impact of zinc, omega‑3 essential fatty acids, and other nutrients such as antioxidants, vitamin E, and vitamin C on PPD is unclear due to conflicting information.Additionally, limited research has been conducted on the association between group B vitamins and PPD.Conclusions: In conclusion, we can lower the risk of PPD by providing dietary guidance and working with healthcare providers.
It is important to pay attention to our diet and make sure we are consuming enough vitamins and nutrients to support our mental health.

Materials and Methods This systematic review study is a part of the results of the doctoral dissertation on reproductive health (design and psychometrics predictive tool for PPD) that was supported by the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and conducted in 2016. In this systematic review, we evaluated all Ghaedrahmati and Alipour: Post-partum depression and nutrition and dietary patternsIranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research ¦ Volume 29 ¦ Issue 3 ¦ May-June 2024 281studies in English and Persian according to the checklist.We used electronic search databases of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, ISI and ISI/Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, and Iranian databases such as Magiran, Scientific Information Database (SID), and IRANDOC from 2003 to 2020.
Searching in the databases was made using keywords “Post‑Partum depression” and “nutrition” or “vitamin D” or “Folic acid” or “iron” or “zinc” or “vitamins” or “carbohydrate” or “vitamin B.” Keywords were selected by the MeSH system for assessing in the PubMed database. We screened studies based on the inclusion criteria of investigating PPD within the first year after delivery, excluding studies on postpartum psychosis or bipolar affective disorders.
Our systematic review was reported by the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‑Analyses” (PRISMA) guidelines.[11] The quantitative studies were assessed for relevance, appropriateness, clarity, and methodology using the Mirza and Jenkins checklist[12] and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement checklist.[13] The quality of the reviews was evaluated based on the assessment criteria in Smith et al.’s study.[14] The initial search yielded 100 abstracts, which were evaluated by two researchers. We conducted content analysis and categorization of the results.Of the 100 articles identified, we included a total of 24 “good‑quality studies” of various designs [Please refer to Figure 1].We followed the standard procedure for data extraction and recorded the relevant information in Table 1.Two researchers independently examined full texts to determine which publications should proceed to the data extraction stage.
The researchers compared their findings and resolved any discrepancies through discussion. Ultimately, we identified 24 papers that met our criteria.To ensure the quality of the studies, we assessed the clarity of their objectives and information using the STROBE statement checklist, which includes items required for reporting observational studies.This assessment helped reduce the risk of bias due to insufficient information.Additionally, we evaluated the data summary forms and the qualifications of studies selected for the systematic review.Ethical considerations This study received approval from the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences Research Committee and Ethics Committee (Grant Number: 394313).All stages of the study were conducted with adherence to research ethics, honesty, and transparency principles.Results Of the 100 articles that were retrieved, only 24 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review [Table 2].
Among those, 17 studies revealed that perinatal depression is associated with lower levels of folate, vitamin D, vitamin B, iron, Se, and Zn.[1,2,9,15‑28] However, only two studies Literature search Databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, ISI/W eb of Science (WOS), Scopus, and Irania n databases such as Magiran, Scientific Information Database (SID), and IRANDO C Search expression: “postpartum depression” and “nutrition” or “nutrition” or “vitamin D” an d “Folic acid or “iron” or “zinc” or “vitamins” or “carbohydrate” or “vitamin B” .

This vitamin is not naturally found in many foods, except for fish, egg yolk and milk are enriched with it.[35] Studies have shown that low levels of vitamin D are associated with PPD.[25,36,37] One study in Iran found that women with low vitamin D levels had a greater risk of depression 6–8 weeks after delivery.[15] Another study found that taking 2,000 units of vitamin D daily in the last 2 weeks of pregnancy and the first 8 weeks after delivery could reduce the risk of PPD.[38] A meta‑analysis study showed that low levels of vitamin D (less than 50 nmol/l) were associated with a 3.67‑fold risk of PPD.[22] A clinical study also found that taking a dose of 2000 IU/d of vitamin D can reduce depressive symptoms.[27] However, findings from cohort studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency is related to the incidence of PPD, and vitamin D may play a significant role in the recovery of women with PPD.
The mechanism of this action is unclear.[29] Group B vitamins Limited evidence suggests that group B vitamins have no direct influence on PPD, as it does not affect the immune system or the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.[2] While some studies have explored their relationship, none provide convincing evidence of a link.[2] Vitamin B1 or thiamine Thiamine is a water‑soluble vitamin that is not stored in the body[19] and must be consumed daily from sources such as beef, chicken, cereals, nuts, and beans.[39] Its daily requirement is 1.1–1.2 mg for adults and 1.4 mg for pregnant and breastfeeding women.[40] It is essential for neurotransmitter synthesis and energy production, and its deficiency can cause brainstem changes and depressive symptoms.[41] Supplementation with thiamine can improve these symptoms.[42] Vitamin B2 or riboflavin Riboflavin is commonly found in dairy products, lean meats, liver, green leafy vegetables, and yeasts,[18] while few studies have analyzed the link between low vitamin B2 and PPD.[18,43] However, a cohort study suggests that moderate intake of vitamin B2 can help reduce the risk of PPD.[43] Vitamin B6 or pyridoxine Vitamin B6 or pyridoxine can be sourced from meat, poultry, fish, eggs, white potatoes, and starchy vegetables.[44] This vitamin is vital for the biosynthesis of essential neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, which are known to improve mood and cognitive function.[45] Patients with depression usually have high homocysteine levels and low levels of folate and vitamin B6.[46] Homocysteine is a non‑essential sulfur amino acid that can be toxic to blood vessels and cause oxidative stress and cell death.[47] A study has shown that taking vitamin B6 can independently reduce the incidence of PPD.[43] Vitamin B12 Normal levels of vitamin B in the blood range from 147.6 to 664.2 pmol/L.
Anything above this range is considered toxic.[16] Vitamin B12 deficiency leads to an increase in homocysteine levels and a decrease in the efficiency of folate and B12 due to its trapping in the 5‑methyltetrahydrofolate cycle instead of the active form of tetrahydrofolate.[16] Folate and vitamin B12 play a vital role in several metabolic pathways in the central nervous system.
Elevated serum homocysteine levels indicate a deficiency of vitamin B12 and folate, and are seen in depressed patients.[48] However, a systematic review found Table 1: Literature search strategy for systematic review of the evidence on Post-partum depression and nutrition and dietary patterns Yield Search terms Database 9281 “postpartum depression” and “nutrition” or “healthy nutrition” or “vitamin D” and “Folic acid” or “iron” or PubMed/MEDLINE 7665 “Zinc” or “vitamins” or “carbohydrate” or “vitamin B.” “postpartum depression” and “nutrition” or “healthy.” ISI/Web of Science (WOS) 834 “nutrition” or “vitamin D” and “Folic acid” or “iron” or “zinc” or “vitamins” or “carbohydrate” or “vitamin B.”Scopus 134 “postpartum depression” and “nutrition” or “healthy nutrition” or “vitamin D” and “Folic acid” or “iron” or “zinc” or “vitamins” or “carbohydrate” or “vitamin B.”Scientific Information Database (SID) 173 “postpartum depression” and “nutrition” or “healthy nutrition” or “vitamin D” and “Folic acid” or “iron” or “zinc” or “vitamins” or “carbohydrate” or “vitamin B.”IranMedex databases Ghaedrahmati and Alipour: Post-partum depression and nutrition and dietary patternsIranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research ¦ Volume 29 ¦ Issue 3 ¦ May-June 2024 283Table 2: Included studies for literature review Authors and year conductedDesign type Number of papers included (date range)Participants Outcome Country Sample Tools Quality level Sparling (2017)[1]Systematic review 24 (1996‑2016) 14262 In all, 14 studies found associations of perinatal depression with lower levels of folate, vitamin D, Fe, Se, Zn, fats, and fatty acids, while two studies found associations between perinatal depression and higher nutrient levels.

It plays a crucial role in both the immune and endocrine systems.[49] Zinc is responsible for stimulating and inhibiting chemical mediators in the central nervous system.[49] According to a comprehensive meta‑analysis, depressed women had lower blood zinc levels (1.85 µmoll/L) than non‑depressed women.[50] Additionally, a systematic review found that low zinc levels are linked to a higher risk of PPD.[1] However, several studies have shown no correlation between serum zinc levels and postpartum blues syndrome.[34] Moreover, a clinical trial found that zinc did not have a significant effect on reducing postpartum anxiety and depressive symptoms.[33] Iron Various studies have indicated that women with anemia tend to experience more significant PPD as compared to other mothers.[9] The diagnosis and treatment of anemia during pregnancy can help reduce the risk of PPD.[51] Additionally, low ferritin levels during the postpartum period can also contribute to PPD.[28] A cohort study in China involving 1,592 women showed that consuming iron for over 6 months, which began during pregnancy, helped reduce the risk of depression 6 and 12 months after delivery.[52] However, another study found no association between maternal serum iron and postpartum depressive symptoms.[53] A quality cohort study conducted on 649121 samples over 10 years showed that there is a significant association between anemia and depression during the first year after delivery.[23] Foods such as red meat, liver, seeds, beans, and oysters are rich sources of iron.[54] Folate Folate is an essential component in the synthesis of chemical mediators such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.
Studies have shown a link between folate levels and cognitive function.[42,43] Folate is required in the synthesis of S‑Adenosyl Methionine (SAM) from Homocysteine (HCY), which is essential for neurotransmitter production. Furthermore, a deficiency in folate can halt the production of HCY to cysteine.However, several studies have revealed that elevated HCY levels are associated with PPD.[21,52] A cohort study of 1,592 Chinese pregnant women followed up for up to 6 months postpartum found that taking folic acid for more than 6 months reduced the risk of PPD.[55] Essential fatty acids Essential unsaturated fatty acids, also known as Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs), are divided into two Table 2: Contd...

Omega‑3, which is derived from three fat groups, namely Alpha‑Linolenic Acid (ALA), Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), is a type of linolenic acid.[17] The significant positive association between n‑3 PUFAs intake and PPD.[56] Studies have shown that there is a link between low levels of omega‑3 fatty acids and higher levels of PPD.[17] Among these, the role of the DHA is more pronounced. Pregnancy and lactation naturally decrease DHA levels.[28,57] However, the connection between DHA and PPD is inconsistent.
In an interventional study, even with a daily intake of 200 mg of DHA in women with lowered serum levels, there was no change in the prevalence of PPD in the first 4 months after delivery.[31] Nonetheless, some studies have found no correlation between fish intake or omega‑3 supplementation and PPD.[30,58] In general, systematic reviews have been unable to establish an effective relationship between omega‑3 fatty acids and PPD.[59] However, the prevalence of PPD is higher in vegetarian diets than in omnivorous diets.[26] Carbohydrates Carbohydrates play a crucial role in energy production and can impact mood.
Although a few studies have been conducted on the relationship between carbohydrates and the risk of PPD,[29,60,61] research has shown that pregnancy leads to insulin resistance,[60] which can make women more susceptible to depression and impaired glucose tolerance.[61] A cohort study has found that women with gestational diabetes are at a significantly higher risk of developing PPD during pregnancy and the postpartum period.[62] Additionally, it has been hypothesized that decreased insulin levels after delivery can lower serotonin levels and cause depression.[32] Fluctuations in blood sugar levels can also lead to the secretion of inflammatory and adipokine markers such as interleukin 6, which have been linked to PPD.[63,64] However, one cohort study found no association between glycemic index and PPD.[30] Finally, low‑carbohydrate diets tend to increase the risk of depression because they reduce the production of serotonin in the brain.
Carbohydrate‑rich foods, however, promote the feeling of well‑being by triggering the production of tryptophan.[65] Antioxidants Vitamin C plays a crucial role in preventing oxidative stress.
It also acts as a cofactor for a group of enzymes that are responsible for regulating and synthesizing important functions throughout the body.[55] A study has indicated that a high dose of vitamin C (3 g/day) can reduce the severity of PPD.[9] However, another study has found that compressed drops of orange peel do not have any effect on PPD or anxiety.[59] There was no significant association found between vitamin E or carotenoids and PPD.[9]Healthy diet pattern Eating a well‑balanced diet includes fruits, vegetables, fish, and seafood.[8] This diet reduces postpartum anxiety and depression.[31,57] Several studies have shown that consuming whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and fish can effectively lower the prevalence and protect against PPD.[10,24] Additionally, a study has found that not consuming enough vegetables is more likely to increase the likelihood of PPD than not eating enough meat.[66] Discussion This study is a systematic review that aims to explore the relationship between PPD and nutrition, particularly a healthy diet pattern.
Nutrients play a vital role in the brain by providing structural substrates and acting as cofactors in many biological reactions. Many nutrients have been shown to have a role in normal function.Research shows that healthy eating patterns can significantly reduce the risk of PPD by preventing mental health disorders and regulating neurotransmitter synthesis and brain functions associated with depression.[67] The study also reveals that some nutritional deficiencies, such as a lack of vitamins D, iron, and folate, are linked to a higher risk of PPD.Additionally, vitamin D at a dosage of 2000 IU/d can reduce the incidence of depressive symptoms, as found in this review.[68] It is important to note that the majority of pregnant women have below‑optimal levels of vitamin D, highlighting the need for prenatal education on the importance of this nutrient.
Additionally, the relationship between low iron levels and PPD has been well‑established.[69] Anemia, which can be caused by a reduction of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 2, can be a contributing factor in depression.[70] Correction of pregnancy anemia, therefore, is crucial. Poor dietary quality has also been associated with PPD in some studies,[71] emphasizing the importance of healthy eating patterns.In line with these findings, iron, along with other nutrients, plays an essential role in maintaining mental health and improving brain function.Foods rich in iron include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dried beans, and fortified cereals.The form of iron found in meat products, called heme, is more easily absorbed.Maintaining healthy eating patterns that include vegetables is crucial for good health.
The results of a recent study suggest that iron, among other essential nutrients, plays a critical role in maintaining mental health and improving brain function.[71] There is conflicting information about the role of omega‑3 essential fatty acids and other nutritional factors such as vitamin E or vitamin C in mental health.
A large cohort Ghaedrahmati and Alipour: Post-partum depression and nutrition and dietary patternsIranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research ¦ Volume 29 ¦ Issue 3 ¦ May-June 2024 287study showed no substantial evidence of an association between omega‑3 and PPD in an adjusted model.[72] Some studies have reported a strong relationship between PPD and vitamin B,[43] but this was not found in this study or some others.[2] Despite the varying results, it is clear that nutrition has a significant impact on mental health, and some nutritional deficiencies contribute to the development of PPD.[73] One limitation of the study was the lack of clinical trial articles, and the wide variety of working methods used in different studies may affect the results. Conclusion Nutrition plays a crucial role in mental health, particularly with regard to depression.
A lack of vitamin D, iron, folate, carbohydrates, and a healthy diet pattern (with an emphasis on vegetables) increases the risk of PPD. Depletion of nutrient reserves during pregnancy can also increase the risk of maternal depression.Eating vegetables and adopting a healthy eating pattern can help reduce the risk of PPD.Further evidence is needed to guide clinical practice on nutritional biomarkers.Acknowledgements This study received approval from the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences Research Committee and Ethics Committee (Grant Number: 394313).The researchers would like to sincerely thank the research deputy, and respected midwifery and reproductive health professors of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.Financial support and sponsorship Isfahan University of Medical Sciences Conflicts of interest Nothing to declare.References 1.Sparling TM, Nesbitt RC, Henschke N, Gabrysch S.Nutrients and perinatal depression: A systematic review.J Nutr Sci 2017;6:e61.2.
