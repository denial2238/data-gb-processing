Review Whey Protein Supplementation and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Risk Factors: An Umbrella Systematic Review of RandomizedControlled Trials Gavin Connolly1, Yu Wang1, Robert E.Bergia1, Eric M.Davis1, Adam W.Byers1, Jason B.Reed2, Wayne W.Campbell1,* 1Department of Nutrition Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States;2Libraries and School of Information Studies, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States ABSTRACT Emerging research suggests whey protein (WP) supplementation may modify type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk factors, including glucose control.As systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) gain importance in nutrition literature, weconducted an umbrella systematic review to chronicle published systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of RCTs pertinent to WP supplementation and T2DM modi ﬁable risk factors.This review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews standards.
Potentially eligible articles were identi ﬁed via a systematic search of 5 electronic health research databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL [EBSCO], Scopus, and SPORTDiscus [EBSCO]). Included articles were assessed for quality using the “A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2 ”critical appraisal tool.Thirteen articles, representing 109 unique RCTs, of the 2205 identi ﬁed articles met the inclusion criteria.Nine articles (69%) were deemed high quality, 2 (15%) moderate quality, and 2 (15%) low quality.Findings from this umbrella review of 13 systematic reviews, including 12 meta-analyses, suggest WP may lower hemoglobin A1c,homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and fasting insulin in groups classi ﬁed as overweight/obese or at risk for or with metabolic syndrome; blood triglycerides in groups classi ﬁed as overweight/obese or at risk for or with metabolic syndrome; and blood pressure in groups classi ﬁed as overweight/obese.
WP did not differentially affect C-reactive protein, body weight, body mass index, or waist circumference, nor did it adversely affect any T2DM risk factors. Insuf ﬁcient evidence precluded assessing the in ﬂuence of WP on glucose control-related outcomes in groups classi ﬁed at lower risk for T2DM.Information regarding WP dose, duration, or types was insufﬁcient to draw conclusions.Collectively, evidence suggests WP supplementation may improve multiple clinical indicators of glucose control, along with triglycerides and blood pressure, in groups of adults at increased risk of developing T2DM.Keywords : dairy protein, milk protein, dietary protein, cardiometabolic, metabolic health, metabolic disease, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular Introduction Diet is a leading modi ﬁable cause of poor health globally, with poor diets accounting for 10.9 million deaths (22% of alldeaths among adults in 2017).
Of these deaths, type 2 diabetesmellitus (T2DM) was the third leading cause of diet-relateddeaths [ 1]. As such, dietary components can positively or negatively in ﬂuence the prevention and treatment of T2DM.While dairy foods are widely consumed [ 2,3], evidence on their risk for T2DM is mixed (e.g., negative [ 4–6], neutral [ 7–9], beneﬁcial [ 10–13]).Whey protein (WP) is one component of dairy that may confer favorable effects on some T2DM risk factors.Observationalstudies that provide information on self-reported dietary intakes of dairy foods and associations with T2DM risk do not consider WP supplementation.

This is an open access article under the CC BY license ( http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ).Current Developments in Nutrition 7 (2023) 102017 has mostly been conducted using randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which can assess causality between a speci ﬁc exposure and outcome [ 14].Primary outcomes typically are indices of body weight control, whole body composition, and skeletalmuscle mass and function.Emerging research —usually as sec- ondary or exploratory outcomes —has included assessments of how WP in ﬂuences various facets of glycemic control and risk factors for T2DM.WP ingestion may facilitate improvement inpostprandial glycemic responses by slowing gastric emptyingand stimulating insulin secretion [ 15–18].In addition, some evidence suggests bioactive compounds found in whey, such asimmunoglobulins, glutamine, lactoferrin, and lactalbumin, maybe bene ﬁcial for improving metabolic parameters [ 19–22].
Given the potential for WP to in ﬂuence T2DM risk factors and the increasing prevalence of T2DM worldwide —which has nearly quadrupled in the last 4 decades [ 23]—it is important to better understand the effects of WP on risk factors for T2DM. We originally planned to perform a scoping review, which would identify pertinent literature on the effects of WP on T2DM riskfactors, without presenting the ﬁndings.However, upon identi- fying the pertinent articles, we transitioned to an umbrella re-view to present a synthesis of research ﬁndings.Therefore, the purpose of this umbrella systematic review is to chronicleexperimental research pertinent to WP supplementation andT2DM risk factors in humans by searching the scienti ﬁc litera- ture for peer-reviewed systematic reviews and/or meta-analysesof RCTs.
Prominent risk factors include fasting and postprandialblood glucose and insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), HOMA-IR, body weight, BMI, waist circumference, C-reactive protein (CRP), and blood lipids and lipoproteins. Methods Protocol The protocol for this umbrella systematic review was devel- oped in accordance with PRIOR (Preferred Reporting Items forOverviews of Reviews) recommended guidelines for reportingthe evidence reviewed for this article [ 24].This umbrella sys- tematic review included systematic reviews and/ormeta-analyses of RCTs in humans.We identi ﬁed systematic re- views based on the de ﬁnition provided by Cochrane [ 25].The original scoping review protocol was registered with Open Sci- ence Framework ( https://osf.io/8scfw/ ) because PROSPERO does not accept scoping review registrations.The umbrella re-view itself was not registered with PROSPERO because we hadalready performed the literature search, and the protocol wasalready registered with Open Science Framework.
Research objective To identify and synthesize evidence from systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of RCTs pertinent to WP supplementation and T2DM risk factors. Search strategy, article selection process, and data extraction Throughout this umbrella systematic review, the term “article ” refers to a publication identi ﬁed via the search process.Potentially eligible articles were identi ﬁed via a systematic search of 5 elec- tronic health research databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library[reviews and trials], CINAHL [EBSCO], Scopus, and SPORTDiscus [EBSCO]) from inception to 27 January, 2023.The 5 search stra-tegies (one for each database) were developed by a health scienceslibrarian (JBR) in collaboration with other review team members(full search strategies are presented in Supplementary Table 1 ).
The search was ﬁrst created in PubMed using a combination of MeSH terms and keywords searched in the title/abstract ﬁelds and were based on the population, intervention, comparison, outcome,and study design (PICOS) information provided in Table 1 .T h e entire search strategy, including the hedge for systematic reviewsand/or meta-analyses [ 26], was translated into the other databases using controlled terms and free text terms in Cochrane Library,CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus; because Scopus does not offer acontrolled vocabulary, only the free text terms were used. The onlyother differences in the search involved the search hedge for sys-tematic reviews and/or meta-analyses.The PubMed version [ 26] was used in Cochrane because it includes MeSH terms; however, a speciﬁc hedge created for CINAHL [ 27] was used in both CINAHL and SPORTDiscus because it was also accessed via the EBSCOplatform.
The CINAHL version was also used as the foundation forthe Scopus version because both platforms allow for proximitysearching. The initial search was conducted on 10 May, 2021 andupdated on 27 January, 2023.Duplicates were identi ﬁed and removed using the built-in duplication checker in Covidence [ 28].There were 5 total reviewers (AWB, EMD, GC, REB, and YW).Thetitle and abstract of the articles, and subsequently the full text ofarticles, were independently assessed using Covidence by 2 inde-pendent reviewers to determine eligibility.A sixth reviewer (WWC) was consulted if the 5 primary reviewers could not reach consensus on article inclusion or exclusion.The reference lists ofarticles included were manually searched for additional articleswhich may ful ﬁll the inclusion criteria.The inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in Table 2 .
The search process ( Figure 1 ) and data extraction processe consisted of the following 3 stages: 1) potential eligibility based on information provided in the title and abstract, 2) conﬁrmation of eligibility based on information provided in the purposestatement of the full text of quali ﬁed abstracts, and 3) data extraction and critical appraisal of included systematic reviews and meta-analyses were assessed for methodological quality using AMSTAR 2 [ 29] from full-text articles if deemed quali ﬁed. The predetermined information extracted from all quali ﬁed full-text articles is shown in Supplementary Table 2 .The data extraction from each article and quality assessment of each article were performed by 2 independent reviewers usingCovidence and crosschecked to ensure accuracy.Article authorswere contacted for additional information if necessary.

Connolly et al.Current Developments in Nutrition 7 (2023) 102017 2 authors of 3 articles were contacted regarding units of measure for outcomes, but we did not receive any responses.This umbrella review is based on information contained in each of the systematic review articles.Other than documenting whichoriginal RCTs were included in each article ( Supplementary Table 3 ), information contained in each RCT was not extracted or used for this umbrella review.
We documented the method used bythe authors of each article to assess risk of bias of primary RCTs(e.g., Jadad Scale, Cochrane Risk of Bias tool) included within eacharticle and certainty of evidence for outcomes (e.g., Grading ofRecommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations[GRADE]). We also summarized and evaluated the data obtained from each article using a 3-step process: 1) data are reported in Tables 3 and 4 and summarized by category and individual outcome in the Re-sults; 2) aggregated data among all articles are summarized in the Discussion; and 3)t h eﬁndings were evaluated and rationales for our interpretations described in the Discussion.Final evaluationswith rationales include consideration of potential factors (e.g.,health status, BMI classi ﬁcation, or physical activity level) contributing to interarticle heterogeneity or discrepancies.Results Study features and participant characteristics The search identi ﬁed 2964 articles.
After removing duplicates (n¼759), a total of 2205 articles remained. The titles and abstracts of the 2205 articles, and subsequently the full texts of135 articles, were independently assessed using Covidence by 2 independent reviewers to determine eligibility.Thirteen articles meeting the inclusion criteria were identi ﬁed (Figure 1 ).The characteristics of these articles are provided in Table 3 .Of the 13 articles, 12 were systematic reviews and meta-analysescombined [ 19,30–40] and one was a systematic review [ 32].Among the 13 articles, the number of RCTs per article ranged from 5 [ 33]t o3 7[ 30], which cumulatively represents 109 unique RCTs (accounting for duplication; Supplementary Table 3 ).The primary outcomes reported included: indices of glycemic control [ 19,30,33,39]; blood lipids and lipoproteins [19,30,39,40]; blood pressures [ 30,39]; body weight [ 31,34,36, 38,39]; BMI [ 35,38]; waist circumference [ 30,35,38,39]; and CRP and high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) [ 37,41].
For an outcome that had more than one article report on it, the amount of overlapamong and between studies is provided in Supplementary Tables 4 –12. Eleven articles included both males and females [19,30,32,33,35 –38,39–41], and 2 included only females [ 31, 34].Among the 13 articles, the total number of participants ranged from 134 [ 33] to 2344 [ 30], and the age of participants ranged from 18 [ 19,30,35,36]t o8 1[ 30] y.Participants were classi ﬁed, based on BMI, as overweight or with obesity in 6 ar- ticles [ 19,30,35,37,39,41]; normal weight, overweight, or with obesity in 4 articles [ 33,36,38,40]; normal weight and over- weight in one article [ 34]; and not classi ﬁed in 2 articles [ 31,32].Intervention durations ranged from acute postprandial responses[33]t o7 8w k[ 32,37].Whey protein supplementation doses in the intervention groups ranged from 0.04 g/d [ 32] to 111 g/d [37,38].
Ten articles included RCTs with exercise components [30,32,34,36,38–41]; 1 article excluded RCTs with exercise components [ 19]; and 2 articles did not report on exercise [ 33, 37]. Seven articles included RCTs that had an energy restriction component [ 19,30, 32,35,39,40], while 4 articles did not report on energy intakes [ 33,36,38,41].Five articles included RCTs with both exercise and energy restriction [ 31,32,35,39,40].Quality of selected studies Based on the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool, 9 articles (69%) were deemed high quality [ 19,31–35,37,38,40], 2 articles (15%) were moderate quality [ 39,41], and 2 articles (15%) were lowTable 2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria used for article selection Included Excluded Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of RCTs investigating whey protein intake and T2DM risk factors Published in the English languagePublished up to May 2021 Study population: Humans with no age or sex restrictionsOutcome variables 1.

The primary reasons for a moderate or low-quality score were the authors 1) did not consider risk of bias when interpreting the results of the review [ 30,36];2) did not report on the sources of funding for the studies included in the review [ 30, 36,38,39,41]; or 3) did not report any potential sources of con ﬂict of interest, including any funding they received for conductingthe review [ 30,36,41]. Results from included articles Results from the 13 articles are provided in Table 4 , and the results from subgroup analyses are provided in Supplementary Table 14 .All values are weighted mean differences (WMDs) in change values between WP and comparator interventions unlessotherwise stated.The WMD values do not identify the directionof any intervention-related changes in outcomes of interest,unless noted.Units of measure for outcomes are included if they were reported in the original articles.Three articles did notprovide units of measures [ 19,30,39].
Comparator interventions Assessment of WP compared to various speci ﬁc comparator interventions is beyond the scope of this umbrella reviewbecause 11 of the 13 articles did not do subgroup analyses basedon speci ﬁc types of comparators. Glycemic control Two articles reported a reduction [ 30,39], and 1 article re- ported no difference [ 19] in fasting blood glucose with WP compared with comparator interventions.One article reported a reduction in fasting insulin with WP compared with comparator interventions [ 19].One article reported reductions in post- prandial glucose and no differences in postprandial insulin at 60and 120 min with WP compared with comparators [ 33].One article reported no difference in glucose incremental area under FIGURE 1.PRISMA ﬂow diagram for this umbrella systematic review of randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of whey protein supplementation on type 2 diabetes mellitus risk factors.G.Connolly et al.

One article reported a reduction[19], and 2 articles reported no difference [ 39,40]i n LDL-cholesterol with WP compared with comparator in-terventions. One article reported a reduction [ 30], 1 article re- ported a difference favoring [ 39], and 2 articles reported no difference [ 19,40] in HDL-cholesterol with WP compared with comparator interventions.Three articles reported a reduction[19,30,40], and 1 article reported no difference [ 39] in tri- glycerides with WP compared with comparator interventions.Subgroup analyses by Zhang et al.[ 40] identi ﬁed WP reduced triglycerides for participants with a BMI /C2130 kg/m 2 but not <30 kg/m2.Subgroup analyses also identi ﬁed WP reduced triglycerides when the dose was /C2130 g/d but not <30 g/d, and when participants were not exercise training or inenergy restriction.Whey protein did not in ﬂuence triglycerides when participantes were exercise training or in energy restric-tion.
Whey protein did not in ﬂuence triglycerides in partici- pants with a baseline LDL-cholesterol of /C213.2 mmol/L or <3.2 mmol/L [ 40]. Blood pressures Two articles reported a reduction in both systolic and dia- stolic blood pressures with WP compared with comparator in- terventions [ 30,39].C-reactive protein Two articles reported no difference in CRP or hs-CRP with WP compared with comparator interventions [ 37,41].Subgroup analyses by Zhou et al.[ 41] identi ﬁed WP reduced CRP when the dose was /C2120 g/d but not <20g/d.In addition, WP reduced CRP in participants with a baseline CRP /C213 mg/dL but not <3 mg/dL.WP did not in ﬂuence CRP independent of intervention durations <12 wk or /C2112 wk [ 41].Subgroup analyses by Prokopidis et al.[ 37] identi ﬁed that WP reduced CRP when the intervention duration was /C208 wk but not>8 wk and in participants with BMI <25 kg/m2but not with BMI/C2125 kg/m2.
Additionally, WP did not in ﬂuence CRP in in- dividuals aged <60 or/C2160 y; with sarcopenia or prefrailty; or when the dose was <30 g/d or /C2130 g/d [ 37]. Body weight, BMI, and waist circumference Among 6 articles, 5 reported no differential changes in body weight for WP compared with comparator interventions [ 31,34, 36,38], WP compared with carbohydrates [ 31,35], and WP compared with other protein sources [ 35].One article reported a reduction in body weight for WP compared with comparator interventions [ 39].Based on pre- to postintervention assess- ments (within-group meta-analysis), 2 articles reported nochange in body weight with WP as a dietary supplement [ 35,38], while 1 article [ 35] reported WP reduced body weight when used as a dietary replacement.One article reported a reduction in BMI with WP from pre- to postintervention and WP compared with comparators [ 38], while 1 article reported no difference in BMI for WP comparedwith carbohydrate interventions [ 35].
One article reported a reduction [ 30] and 3 articles reported no difference [ 35,38,39] in waist circumference with WP compared with comparator interventions. In addition, 2 articles [35,38] reported no difference in waist circumference with WP from pre- to postintervention.Subgroup analyses by Bergia et al.(31), Miller et al.[ 35], and Kuo et al.[ 34] identi ﬁed WP did not in ﬂuence changes in body weight with or without resistance training.In addition, the typeof WP, isolate or concentrate, did not in ﬂuence body weight [ 29].Similarly, subgroup analyses by Piri Damaghi et al.[ 36] indicated WP did not in ﬂuence body weight, independent of dose, inter- vention duration, or participant sex.However, WP reduced bodyweight in participants classi ﬁed as overweight or with obesity, but not normal weight; independent of weight classi ﬁcation, WP reduced body weight without, but not with, exercise [ 36].
Discussion To the authors ’knowledge, this is the ﬁrst umbrella system- atic review to search for, chronicle, and assess the quality ofpeer-reviewed published scienti ﬁc literature of systematic re- views and/or meta-analyses of RCTs pertinent to WP supple-mentation and T2DM risk factors. Among the 13 articlesincluded in this umbrella review, evidence indicates that WPmay improve measures of glucose control in individuals classi-ﬁed as overweight or with obesity [ 19,30,39] or at risk for or with metabolic syndrome [ 19]; triglycerides in individuals classi ﬁed as overweight or with obesity [ 19,30,40] or at risk for or with metabolic syndrome [ 19,30,42]; and blood pressure in individuals classi ﬁed as overweight or with obesity [ 30,39].WP supplementation did not differentially affect other blood lipidsand lipoproteins, CRP, hs-CRP, body weight, BMI, or waistcircumference.None of the 13 articles identi ﬁed any negative responses of WP on T2DM-related outcomes of interest.
Critical appraisal of this research includes reviewing the quality of the current umbrella review; the quality of each sys-tematic review and/or meta-analysis included in this umbrellareview; and the quality of individual RCTs included in eachsystematic review and/or meta-analysis. AMSTAR 2 criticallyappraises the conduct of included systematic reviews of RCTs.Although “study quality ”is not well de ﬁned, it relates to how well a study is designed, conducted, analyzed, and reported [ 43].Based on AMSTAR 2, the methodological quality of the 13 arti-cles varied from high (69%; 9 articles) [ 19,31–35,37,38,40]t o moderate (15%; 2 articles) [ 39,41], to low (15%; 2 articles) [ 30, 36] among reviews.
The primary reasons for a moderate or low-quality score were the authors 1) did not consider risk of bias when interpreting the results of the review [ 30,36];2) did not report on the sources of funding for the studies included in thereview [ 30,36,38,39,41]; or 3) did not report any potential sources of con ﬂict of interest, including any funding they received for conducting the review [ 30,36,41]. The authors of AMSTAR 2 state that although they “believe seven domains can critically affect the validity of a review and its conclusions, ”they “recognize that the items listed as critical domains will not al- ways be regarded as critical ”[29].As such, with AMSTAR 2, if aG.Connolly et al.Current Developments in Nutrition 7 (2023) 102017 9 systematic review receives a lower rating, it does not mean that it inherently impacts the quality of research, as this is more rele-vant to the individual RCTs included within each review.
To independently assess the methodological quality of RCTs, a tool such as the Jadad Scale [ 44]—the most widely used such assessment tool [ 45]—is required, which was used in 2 (15%) articles [ 40,41]. The Jadad Scale assesses the methodological quality of an RCT based on 5 questions pertaining to 3 key fea-tures, speci ﬁcally randomization, masking, and accountability of all patients, including withdrawals [ 44].However, it does not account for allocation concealment, which is considered to beessential to avoid bias by The Cochrane Collaboration [ 43].As such, to more comprehensively assess risk of bias of each indi-vidual RCT included in a systematic review, the Cochrane Risk ofBias tool was developed and is often used, which was used in 9(69%) articles [ 19,30,31–34,36,37,39].
An in-depth discussion on the development, use, and strengths and limitations of each quality assessment tool mentioned above is beyond the scope of this review, and further information on each can be found in thefollowing references [ 29,43–47]. The information from these assessments of these articles is provided within the originalpublications.Our results should be interpreted with this in mindbecause a high-quality systematic review included in our reviewcould have potentially included low-quality empirical studies.Importantly, AMSTAR 2, the Jadad Scale, or Cochrane Risk of Bias does not rate the certainty of evidence for outcomes basedon included RCTs, which can be used for making clinical practicerecommendations.To rate the certainty of evidence in systematic reviews for making clinical practice recommendations, an approach such as the GRADE approach is required, which pro-vides an overall rating to the body of evidence of included RCTsfor an outcome [ 47–49].
However, only 4 (31%) of 13 included articles [ 19,33,34–37] used GRADE for determining the cer- tainty of evidence for the outcomes assessed. The reports ofGRADE assessments for the outcomes included in these articlesare provided in Supplementary Table 15 .Glycemic control Biological plausibility.WP is a rich source of amino acids, and bioactive substances such as immunoglobulins, glutamine, lactoferrin, and lactal-bumin, which augment glycemic control via several inter-connected mechanisms [ 19–22].These mechanisms include amino acid-induced insulin secretion, stimulating the secretion of incretin hormones, inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase 4, and aslower rate of gastric emptying [ 50].Amino acids, in particular, the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, have strong insulinotropic ef-fects, with leucine being the most potent [ 51,52].
Leucine stimulates glutamate dehydrogenase activity in the βcells of the pancreas, which results in an increase in Krebs cycle activity andoxygen consumption in the βcells and a subsequent increase in insulin secretion [ 51]. WP consumption also stimulates the secretion of the gut-derived incretin hormones glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which have strong insulinotropic effects [ 15,16,18,41].GLP-1 and GIP act via G protein-coupled receptors that are highlyexpressed in βcells of the pancreas to stimulate βcell activity and insulin secretion [ 15,16,18,33,53].In addition to incretinsstimulating insulin secretion, they stimulate βcell proliferation and reduce apoptosis of βcells [ 53].Whey peptides also inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a protein that increases the degradationof GIP and GLP-1, thereby improving blood glucose control [ 15, 16,18].A slower rate of gastric emptying also improves blood glucose control [ 16,48,49].
An increase in GLP-1 also slows the rate of gastric emptying mediated through afferent signals from the vagus nerve to the brain. Additionally, WP consumptionstimulates the secretion of the gut-derived hormones cholecys-tokinin (CCK) and peptide YY (PYY), which also acts to slow therate of gastric emptying mediated through central-relatedmechanisms [ 16,54,55].Evidence from the systematic reviews of RCTs.Overall, evidence regarding glycemic control suggests a favorable effect with WP compared with comparator in-terventions in individuals classi ﬁed as overweight or with obesity or at risk for or with metabolic syndrome.Among the 3 articles that reported on fasting blood glucose, 2 reported a decrease in fasting blood glucose with WP comparedwith comparator interventions [ 30,39], while 1 article found no difference between interventions [ 19].As 3 (75%) of 4 RCTs included in Wirunsawanya et al.[ 39] were also included in Badely et al.
[ 30], we are only comparing the articles by Amirani et al. [ 19] and Badely et al.[ 30] that may factor into why dif- ferences were observed between articles for fasting bloodglucose.Although both articles included participants who wereoverweight or obese, participants in Badely et al.[ 30] were otherwise healthy with no diagnosed diseases, whereas inAmirani et al.[ 19], participants had metabolic syndrome or conditions related to metabolic syndrome.In addition to differ-ences in health status, Amirani et al.[ 19] excluded RCTs with an exercise component, whereas Badely et al.[ 30] included RCTs with an exercise component.The participant characteristics inAmirani et al.[ 19] indicated they were more metabolically dysregulated than the participants in Badely et al.[ 30].It may be that interventions with WP alone in the participant population inAmirani et al.
[ 19] were not suf ﬁcient to induce a bene ﬁt compared with comparator interventions, whereas in theparticipant population in Badely et al. [ 30], it was, in addition to including RCTs with an exercise component, which is a potentstimulus for improving blood glucose control.The differences inhealth status and exercise likely factor into why differences be-tween articles were observed.However, Amirani et al.[ 19] did report a low quality of evidence for fasting blood glucose based on the GRADE approach.The one article by Amirani et al.[ 19] that reported on other measures of glycemic control showed that in adults who wereoverweight or with obesity and with metabolic syndrome orconditions related to metabolic syndrome, there were reductionsin fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c with WP compared withcomparator interventions.Based on GRADE, the certainties ofevidence were moderate for insulin and HbA1c and low forHOMA-IR.The one article by Chiang et al.
[ 33] that reported on post- prandial glucose and insulin showed reductions in glucose, but not insulin, at 60 and 120 min. Additionally, glucose iAUC wasnot different, but insulin iAUC was greater with WP comparedwith comparator interventions.These ﬁndings should be inter- preted with caution as the number of RCTs in the meta-analysesG.Connolly et al.Current Developments in Nutrition 7 (2023) 102017 10 for these outcomes ranged from 2 to 4, with moderate to high heterogeneities, and the certainties of evidence based on GRADEwere deemed very low to low.Taken together, the evidence from mechanistic studies and from included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTssuggest that WP may improve measures of glycemic control in groups classi ﬁed as overweight or with obesity or at risk for or with metabolic syndrome.The low to very low certainty of evi-dence based on GRADE assessments underscores cautionregarding the effectiveness of WP in improving measures ofglycemic control.
Insuf ﬁcient evidence precluded assessing the inﬂuence of WP on glucose control-related outcomes in groups classi ﬁed with normal body weight and at lower risk for impaired glucose control or T2DM. Blood lipids and lipoproteins Biological plausibility There are several biologically plausible mechanisms by which WP may improve lipid metabolism and lipid pro ﬁles.WP con- sumption in ﬂuences lipid metabolism by stimulating lipoprotein lipase, promoting hepatic lipid metabolism, inhibiting intestinalfatty acid and cholesterol absorption, and increasing the excre- tion of fecal sterols mediated by the presence of bioactive com- pounds such as β-lactoglobulin and sphingolipids in WP, and the downregulation of the expression of genes related to cholesterolmetabolism, lipogenesis, and fatty acid transporters [ 56–58].
Evidence from the systematic reviews of RCTs Overall, the evidence regarding blood lipids and lipoproteins indicates either a favorable or neutral effect with WP comparedwith interventions in adults who were classi ﬁed as overweight or moderately obese, without [ 27,39,40] or with metabolic syndrome or conditions related to metabolic syndrome [ 19,40]. Only 1 RCT included in Zhang et al.[ 40] studied participants who were normal weight, thereby precluding us from drawing conclusions on theeffects of WP on lipids and lipoproteins in individuals with normal weight.Regarding triglycerides, the 3 articles that reported favorable effects of WP included 28 [ 30], 18 [ 19], and 13 [ 40] RCTs.In comparison, the article reporting a neutral effect of WPcontained only 6 RCTs.As such, the favorable effects of WP ontriglycerides may, in part, relate to the larger sample sizes andimproved power to detect an effect.
Based on the Jadad Scale andrisk of biases, the majority of RCTs with assessments of lipids andlipoproteins were of moderate to high quality, with low risk ofbiases. Yet, based on GRADE the certainty of evidence for theoutcomes assessed was deemed low to very low.Collectively, re-sults from these assessment tools underscore caution regarding the effectiveness of WP in improving blood lipids and lipoproteins.Blood pressures Biological plausibility Hypertension is a modi ﬁable risk factor associated with T2DM and mortality.Elevated blood pressure is, in part, reﬂective of underlying insulin resistance of the vasculature and kidney [ 59].Also, dysregulations in carbohydrate meta- bolism are more common in individuals with hypertension [ 60, 61], indicating a bidirectional pathogenic relationship betweenT2DM and hypertension [ 62].
Reductions in blood pressures observed with WP, may in part, be explained by the presence ofangiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides found inWP, which decreases the enzymatic conversion of angiotensin Ito vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and augments nitricoxide-mediated vasodilation [ 63–65]. Evidence from the systematic review of RCTs The 2 articles reporting on blood pressures showed WP reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures in adults classi ﬁed as overweight or with obesity [ 30,39].These ﬁndings should be interpreted with caution because the articles were deemed low[30] and moderate [ 39] quality (AMSTAR 2), and one [ 30] did not report on their Cochrane Risk of Bias assessments.C-reactive protein Biological plausibility Increased incidence of T2DM is associated with increased CRP (a marker of in ﬂammation), increased oxidative stress, and a decreased concentration of the antioxidant glutathione [ 66].
Glutathione exists in 2 states, reduced glutathione (GSH) andoxidized glutathione (GSSG). The ratio of GSH to GSSG is a mea-sure of oxidative stress, with a decreased ratio of GSH to GSSGindicating increased oxidative stress and increased in ﬂammation.WP can exert antioxidant and anti-in ﬂammatory effects by increasing the synthesis of the GSH, resulting in reductions inmeasures of in ﬂammation including CRP and insulin resistance [67–69].Evidence from the systematic reviews of RCTs The 2 articles reporting on CRP and hs-CRP found no differen- tial effects with WP compared with comparator interventions intheir overall analyses [ 37,41].The articles were deemed moderate [41] and high quality [ 37] (AMSTAR 2), and the included RCTs had moderate to high Jadad scores [ 41] with moderate and high certainty of evidence for CRP and hs-CRP, respectively [ 37].
The authors noted their reviews were limited by considerable hetero-geneity among studies [ 37,41], making interpretation of ﬁndings complicated. Subgroup analyses by Zhou et al.[ 41]i d e n t i ﬁed baseline CRP as a potential effect modi ﬁer: a reduction in CRP was observed in participants with a baseline CRP /C213 mg/L but not <3 mg/L.This is important because a CRP /C213m g / Li sa s s o c i a t e dw i t h greater T2DM incidence [ 63], and an intervention with WP may be more effective in individuals at greater risk of developing T2DM.Body weight, BMI, and waist circumference Biological plausibility WP may mediate an improvement in body weight, BMI, and waist circumference by altering ingestive behaviors.The con-sumption of WP results in an increase in insulin, which is linkedwith increased satiety and a decrease in the orexigenic hormoneghrelin [ 70].
WP consumption also stimulates the secretion of the gut-derived hormones GLP-1, CCK, and PYY, which increase satiety and slow gastric emptying mediated through afferent signals from the vagus nerve to the brain [ 15,17,18,50]. WP consumption may also in ﬂuence ingestive behaviors mediated through hypothalamic neuropeptides.Energy intake may bedecreased due to WP-induced increases in the anorexigenicG.Connolly et al.Current Developments in Nutrition 7 (2023) 102017 11 neuropeptide pro-opiomelanocortin and decreases in the orexigenic neuropeptides agouti-related peptide and neuropep-tide Y [ 71].In addition, dietary protein consumption, inclusive of WP, relative to carbohydrate and fat augments energyexpenditure by resulting in a 15% to 20% higher thermic effectof feeding, or diet-induced thermogenesis [ 72–75].However, research associating these acute or short-term dietary responses with longer-term changes in body weight and body compositionis inconsistent [ 76–78].
Evidence from the systematic reviews of RCTs Among adults who were healthy [ 31,36], normal weight [ 36], overweight [ 35,36,39], with obesity [ 35,36,39], hyperlipidemic [35], or postmenopausal [ 34], evidence regarding WP effects on body weight, BMI, and waist circumference are predominantlyneutral [ 31,34,35,36,38,39], with some positive effects [ 30,35, 38]. Risk of bias assessments of included RCTs varied.The discordance in ﬁndings may stem from articles differing in experimental features including amounts or types of physicalactivity/exercise and energy intake relative to energy expenditure.Miller et al.[ 35] reported WP reduced body weight when used as a dietary replacement for other sources of energy, with 3 of the 4RCTs conducted with participants not performing resistance training.In contrast, WP did not differentially affect body weight when used as a dietary supplement providing additional energyintake, with 7 of the 9 RCTs including resistance training.
Theseresults suggest consuming WP as a dietary replacement withoutresistance training, compared to WP as a dietary supplement withresistance training, may more effectively promote weight loss.However, this interpretation should be made with caution sincerelative changes in body composition (fat and fat-free masses) arenot considered. Independent of resistance training, subgroup an-alyses by Bergia et al.[ 31], Miller et al.[ 35], and Kuo et al.[ 34] indicated WP did not in ﬂuence changes in body weight.Dose-response The dose of WP is an important factor to consider as there may be minimum and maximum thresholds of the amount of WP and itsbioactive components required to elicit bene ﬁcial effects on T2DM risk factors.
Additionally, the dose that is bene ﬁcial for one or more outcomes may not be the same for all risk factors for T2DM.However, among the articles included in this review, none re- ported responses to 3 or more doses of WP (i.e., a dose-response) for any risk factor for T2DM. Given the wide range of WP dosesamong individual RCTs included within each article in this review,this likely factors into the magnitude and directionality of theﬁndings of the meta-analyses from each article.For example, it is unlikely that WP doses as low as 0.04 g/d or 0.07 g/d will elicit thesame responses as doses as high as 111 g/d.Collectively, newresearch focused on dose-responses to acutely and chronicallyconsuming whey protein on T2DM risk factors seem warranted.
Strengths and limitations The strengths of this umbrella systematic review include that, to the best of the authors ’knowledge, this is the ﬁrst umbrella systematic review to search for, chronicle, and assess the qualityof peer-reviewed published scienti ﬁc literature of systematicreviews and/or meta-analyses of RCTs pertinent to WP supple- mentation and T2DM risk factors. This umbrella systematic re-view followed the PRIOR recommended guide for conducting acomprehensive and rigorous search of the scienti ﬁc literature of systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of RCTs pertinent toWP supplementation and T2DM risk factors and reporting the evidence reviewed for this article.In addition, the use of the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool for assessing the methodolog-ical quality of included articles is another strength by providingan indication of the con ﬁdence, or lack thereof, in the integrity of articles included and reported ﬁndings.
Limitations of this review include only including articles published in English language. We are mindful that with the useof WP supplements it is important to report on participant safetyand any potential adverse health outcomes.However, among theincluded articles, only one [ 33] reported on the effects or asso- ciations of WP supplementation on participant safety or adverse health outcomes.In this article, 1 RCT stated 3 and 4 participants in the comparator and WP groups, respectively, reported milddiarrhea, and 2 participants in the WP group reported ﬂatus.No adverse events were reported among the other 4 RCTs includedin this article [ 33].One other limitation of included articles is that while they reported participant characteristics, they did notspecify race or ethnicity.
Future research recommendations Based on the available evidence and results from this comprehensive umbrella systematic review of RCTs on the ef-fects of whey protein supplementation on T2DM risk factors, thefollowing suggestions may be considered for future research: 1) Future systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses that include investigating the effects of WP supplementationdose, duration, types, and control or comparator in-terventions on T2DM risk factors are warranted. Rationale: Information regarding acute and chronic WP doses, durations, types, or comparator interventions wereinsufﬁcient to draw conclusions, negating making practical and clinical recommendations.These factors may in ﬂuence the magnitudes and directionalities of potential responses.2) Future research on WP supplementation should include reporting on participant safety and any adverse healthoutcomes.
Rationale: Among the included articles, only 1 of 13 reported on the effects or associations of WP supplementation on partic- ipant safety or adverse health outcomes. 3) Future research should include race and ethnicity when reporting participant characteristics.Rationale: None of the 13 articles included information regarding participant race or ethnicity.4) Future systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses should utilize a transparent framework, such as GRADE, forproviding evidence summaries and rating the certainty ofevidence for the effects of WP on T2DM risk factors.G.Connolly et al.Current Developments in Nutrition 7 (2023) 102017 12 Rationale: Quality of evidence ratings are important when evaluating the certainty of evidence to better inform clinicalrecommendations and evidence-based practice.
Conclusions Among the 13 systematic reviews, including 12 meta- analyses, critically assessed for this umbrella review, no re-views reported any adverse effects of WP on any reportedT2DM-related risk factor. Collectively, evidence indicates WPsupplementation may improve several clinical indicators of T2DM risk, including multiple measures of glucose control in individuals classi ﬁed as overweight or with obesity or at risk for or with metabolic syndrome; triglycerides in individuals clas-siﬁed as overweight or with obesity or at risk for or with metabolic syndrome; and blood pressure in individuals classi-ﬁed as overweight or with obesity.
