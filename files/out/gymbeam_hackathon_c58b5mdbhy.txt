ARTICLE OPEN β-Receptor blocker enhances the anabolic effect of PTH after osteoporotic fracture Jie Huang1, Tong Wu1, Yi-Rong Jiang1, Xuan-Qi Zheng1, Huan Wang1, Hao Liu1, Hong Wang1,2,3, Hui-Jie Leng1,2,3, Dong-Wei Fan1,2,3, Wan-Qiong Yuan1,2,3and Chun-Li Song1,2,3✉ The autonomic nervous system plays a crucial role in regulating bone metabolism, with sympathetic activation stimulating bone resorption and inhibiting bone formation.We found that fractures lead to increased sympathetic tone, enhanced osteoclastresorption, decreased osteoblast formation, and thus hastened systemic bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) mice.However, the combined administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the β-receptor blocker propranolol dramatically promoted systemic bone formation and osteoporotic fracture healing in OVX mice.The effect of this treatment is superior to that of treatment with PTHor propranolol alone.
In vitro, the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) suppressed PTH-induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, which was rescued by propranolol. Moreover, NE decreased the PTH-induced expression of Runx2 but enhanced the expression of Rankl and the effect of PTH-stimulated osteoblasts on osteoclastic differentiation, whereas these effects were reversed by propranolol.Furthermore, PTH increased the expression of the circadian clock gene Bmal1 , which was inhibited by NE- βAR signaling.Bmal1 knockdown blocked the rescue effect of propranolol on the NE-induced decrease in PTH- stimulated osteoblast differentiation.Taken together, these results suggest that propranolol enhances the anabolic effect of PTH in preventing systemic bone loss following osteoporotic fracture by blocking the negative effects of sympathetic signaling on PTHanabolism.
Bone Research (2024) 12:18 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41413-024-00321-z INTRODUCTION Osteoporotic fractures are becoming more prevalent as the population ages. 1Patients with osteoporosis-related fractures not only encounter dif ﬁculties in fracture healing but also have an elevated risk of subsequent fractures, which is a challenging issue in clinical practice.2,3Previous studies have indicated that fracture induces acute systemic bone loss, increasing the risk ofsubsequent fractures.4–6However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, and few studies have investigated therapeutic strategies for preventing systemic bone loss and fracture recurrence following fractures.The use of anti-osteoporosis drugs after fractures is controver- sial due to their impact on bone remodeling, which is essential for fracture healing.7Teriparatide, recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH1-34), is the most commonly used anabolic agentin the clinic.
Intermittent PTH administration strongly promotes bone formation and reduces the risk of fractures.2Despite not being approved for fracture treatment, preclinical and clinicalstudies have shown promising therapeutic effects of PTH onfracture healing. 8,9 Bone metabolism is regulated by a complex interplay of various signaling pathways and cellular processes.One of the majorregulators of bone metabolism is the sympathetic nervous system, which suppresses bone formation via osteoblast β-adrenergic receptor ( βAR) signaling.10,11Propranolol, a nonselective βARantagonist, ameliorated hyperte nsion-induced or depression- induced bone loss.12,13Interestingly, there is a functional interaction between parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) and β2AR signaling, with β2AR de ﬁciency hindering both PTH-induced increases in bone formation and resorption.14These ﬁndings indicate that the two signaling pathways are connected and may interact in the maintenance of bone metabolism.
Given the sympathetic stressinduced after fracture, we propose that combination of PTH andpropranolol may contribute to a better therapeutic effect on systemic bone loss after osteoporotic fracture. Bone metabolism exhibits circadian rhythms, represented by the diurnal ﬂuctuation of bone turnover markers and bone metabolism-regulating factors, including PTH.15It is well- established that circadian clock genes play an important role inregulating bone metabolism, and knockout of these genes resultsin signi ﬁcant changes in the bone mass phenotype.
15,16Teripara- tide administration at different times of day (morning or evening) results in signi ﬁcant changes in the 24-h variation in bone turnover markers in postmenopausal osteoporotic women.17 Additionally, βAR signaling in osteoblasts promotes osteoclasto- genesis but also restrains bone formation by inhibiting osteoblast proliferation via a Clock-dependent mechanism.10,18These ﬁnd- ings motivated us to investigate whether circadian clock genes areinvolved in bone remodeling stimulated by the combination therapy comprising PTH and propranolol.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the activation of βAR signaling by NE represses PTH-induced osteogenesis and augments the effect of PTH-induced osteoblastson osteoclast formation, which is reversed by propranolol.Mechanistically, NE- βAR signaling inhibits PTH-induced RUNX2 expression and osteoblast differentiation by regulating BMAL1.
Insummary, our study elucidates the ability of propranolol toenhance the anabolic effect of PTH on systemic bone loss after osteoporotic fracture and the underlying mechanism, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of systemicbone loss after osteoporotic fracture. RESULTS Propranolol improves the bone anabolic effect of PTH after osteoporotic fracture To examine the effects of PTH and propranolol on systemic boneloss after osteoporotic fracture, we generated tibia fracturemodels in mice with ovariectomy (OVX)-induced postmenopausal osteoporosis.The mice were administered PTH, propranolol, PTH +propranolol or vehicle for 4 weeks after fracture.μCT analysis of femurs revealed that fracture resulted in signi ﬁcantly decreased trabecular bone mass in OVX mice, which was determined by quantitative analyses of trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/ TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), number (Tb.N) and separation(Tb.Sp) (Fig.1a–f).
Propranolol administration mildly but signi ﬁcantly increased the trabecular bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness (Fig. 1a, c, d).Moreover, compared with vehicle-treated mice, PTH-treated mice had dramatically increasedcortical bone and trabecular bone volumes (Fig.1a–f).Importantly, the combined treatment with PTH and propranolol increased cortical bone and trabecular bone mass to a greater extent thantreatment with either agent alone (Fig.1a–f).Speci ﬁcally, compared to the vehicle group, the trabecular bone volume fraction was 54% greater in mice treated with PTH alone, and was 93% greater in mice treated with the combination of PTH andpropranolol.Similar results were observed in the μCT analysis of theﬁfth lumbar vertebra (L5).Fracture also led to a signi ﬁcant decrease in the bone volume at L5 (Fig.1g–k).
However, the mice treated with PTH showed a 26% increase in the trabecular bonevolume fraction of L5, and the mice treated with both PTH and propranolol exhibited a 47% greater trabecular bone volume fraction than did the vehicle group (Fig. 1g–k), indicating that propranolol increased the osteogenic effect of PTH by approxi-mately 80% in mice with osteoporotic fractures.We further evaluated the combined effects of PTH and propranolol on normal mice after fracture.Tibial fractures resultedin signi ﬁcant systemic bone loss in mice, as evidenced by the signi ﬁcantly decreased trabecular bone volume in femurs and L5 (Fig.S1a –k).However, propranolol treatment reduced systemic bone loss after fracture and PTH administration dramaticallyimproved the bone mass and microstructure in the femur and L5 following fracture (Fig.S1a –k).Notably, the combined use of propranolol further augmented the anabolic effect of PTH.
These ﬁndings con ﬁrm the occurrence of fracture-induced systemic bone loss in mice with or without OVX and the greater efﬁcacy of the combination of PTH and propranolol than of PTH or propranolol alone in treating systemic bone loss after fracture. Propranolol enhances osteoblastic bone formation and suppresses osteoclastic bone resorption in PTH-treated mice with osteoporotic fractures TRAP (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) staining revealed that fractures induced markedly more osteoclast formation on the bone surface of femurs in the OVX mice than in the control mice(Fig.2a, b).However, both PTH and propranolol treatmentreduced osteoclast formation in the femurs of OVX mice after fracture, and the combination of PTH and propranolol inhibited osteoclast formation to a greater extent than did PTH alone (Fig.2a, b).
Immunohistochemical staining for osteocalcin (OCN) showed that the number of OCN+osteoblast on the trabecular bone surface was signi ﬁcantly reduced in OVX mice after fracture but increased when the mice were treated with PTH (Fig. 2c, d).Compared to that of PTH or propranolol alone, the cotreatment ofPTH and propranolol resulted in signi ﬁcantly increased osteoblast formation in OVX mice after fracture (Fig.2c, d).Calcine double labeling further con ﬁrmed the fracture-induced decrease in the mineral apposition rate (MAR) in OVX mice, which was signi ﬁ- cantly improved by both propranolol and PTH treatment andpeaked under PTH +propranolol intervention (Fig.2e, f).An increase in the serum OCN concentration and a decrease in the serum levels of the resorption marker C-terminal telopeptide oftype I collagen (CTX-I) were detected via enzyme-linked immu- nosorbent assay (ELISA) in the mice cotreated with PTH and propranolol relative to the mice treated with PTH alone (Fig.2g, h).
Sympathetic tone, determined by the serum norepinephrine (NE)concentration, was signi ﬁcantly increased 2 weeks after fracture and returned to normal by 4 weeks after fracture (Fig. 2i).These ﬁndings suggest that propranolol enhances the anabolic effect and suppresses the catabolic effect of PTH, which may beattributed to propranolol ’s competitive inhibition of the βAR agonist NE.Propranolol facilitates the effect of PTH on osteoporotic fracture healing We further assessed the impact of PTH and propranolol onfracture healing in OVX mice via μCT scanning 28 days after fracture.As shown in Fig.3a, OVX mice exhibited impaired fracture healing, characterized by little callus formation and a lack of bridging callus (Fig.3a–c).No signi ﬁcant differences were observed in the bone volume (BV) or BV fraction (BV/TV) of thecalluses between the propranolol and vehicle groups (Fig.3a–c).
However, mice administered PTH showed signi ﬁcantly increased BV and BV/TV in calluses compared to the vehicle group, whereashigher BV and BV/TV in calluses were observed in mice treatedwith PTH +propranolol than in those treated with propranolol or PTH alone (Fig. 3a–c).Similar fracture healing results were observed in fractured mice without OVX administrated with PTHand propranolol (Fig.S2a –c).We also detected the NE levels in the fracture sites and serum of the sham and OVX mice, and there was no signi ﬁcant difference in both the fracture sites and serum between the two groups (Fig.S3a –d).Safranin-O/fast green staining was further performed to examine hard callus formation in the fracture site.
Consistent with the results of the μCT analyses, mice treated with PTH had markedly greater hard callus formation than that of the vehicle group, and thecombination of PTH and propranolol induced a signi ﬁcantly greater hard callus fraction compared to m ice treated with propranolol or PTH alone (Fig. 3d, e).The hard callus fraction was not signi ﬁcantly different between the propranolol and vehicle treatment groups (Fig.3d, e).A three-point bending test was performed to evaluate the biomechanical properties of the fractured tibia.The bone strength ofthe fractured tibia in mice treated with propranolol was similar tothat in the vehicle group, but PTH treatment resulted in a marked increase in the maximum loading force relative to that in the vehicle group (Fig.3f).However, the mice administered PTH +propranolol had the highest maximum loading force among all the groups.
Considering the adverse effects of propranolol, such as fatigue and insomnia, 19,20we monitored the body weight of the mice in each group, detected liver and kidney function, and examined fatigue levels using rotarod tests. No signi ﬁcant differences were found in the body weight (Fig.S4a); liver and kidney function markers levels, including aspartate transaminase ( AST), alanine transaminase (ALP), creatinine (Cr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), among the groupsPropranolol enhances the anabolic effect of PTH J Huang et al.

On day 28 post-fracture, the fractures led to a notable decrease in latency time in the rotarod tests. However, no statisticallysigniﬁcant differences were observed among the fractured mice treated with propranolol, PTH, PTH +propranolol, or vehicle treat- ment (Fig.S4g).These ﬁndings suggest that the administration of PTH and propranolol for a duration of 4 weeks does not induce evidenta d v e r s ee f f e c t si nm i c ew i t hf r a c t u r e s .Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that PTH facilitates fracture healing and that propranolol enhances the effect of PTHon promoting fracture healing.
Activation of βAR signaling suppresses PTH-induced osteoblast differentiationTo investigate the potential mechanism by which the combination of PTH and propranolol induces a stronger osteogenic effect in mice after osteoporotic fractures, bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs)were cultured with intermittent PTH (iPTH), iPTH +norepinephrine(NE), iPTH +NE+propranolol or vehicle under osteogenic induc- tion in vitro. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin Red staining(ARS) revealed that, compared with of the control group, iPTH administration signi ﬁcantly enhanced osteoblast differentiation and calcium nodule formation (Fig.4a–d).However, NE inhibited the osteogenic effect of iPTH, which was reversed by propranololintervention (Fig.4a–d).Similar results were also observed in the mRNA levels of Alpl and Bglap (osteocalcin), genes expressed during osteogenic differentiation, in BMSCs treated with iPTH,iPTH+NE or iPTH +NE+propranolol (Fig.4e, f).
Runx2 ,a n essential transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation, was also enhanced by iPTH treatment, whereas this increase wasreversed by combination with NE, which was further reversed bypropranolol administration (Fig. 4g).These results suggest that NE inhibits the effect of iPTH on bone differentiation through the βAR signaling pathway, which can be rescued by the β-blocker propranolol.OVXa b c d e f gh iOVX+Fx+vehicle OVX+Fx+Pro OVX+Fx+PTH OVX+Fx+PTH+Pro OVX+Fx+vehicle OVX OVX+Fx+Pro OVX+Fx+PTH OVX+Fx+PTH+Pro OVX+Fx+vehicle OVX OVX+Fx+Pro OVX+Fx+PTH OVX+Fx+PTH+ProOVX15*** *** *** * ********* ****** **** **** **** * 30 1.6 100 4 ns nsOVX OVX+Fx10 8 64203 2 1075 5025 01.2 0.8 0.4 0.020 10 010(OCs.S/BS)/% (NO.

However, once the iPTH +NE-stimulated cells were additionally treated with propranolol, the pro-osteoclastogenesiseffect was inhibited (Fig. 4j, k).We also assessed the direct effects of iPTH, iPTH +NE and iPTH +NE+propranolol on osteoclastogenesis to exclude the possible impact of residual PTH, NE and propranololin CM on osteoclast differentiation.TRAP +osteoclast quanti ﬁcation showed no obvious differences among the groups directly treated with iPTH, iPTH +NE, iPTH +NE+propranolol or vehicle (Fig.4l, m), suggesting that the positive effects of iPTH and iPTH +NE on osteoclastogenesis are mediated by osteoblasts.

Moreover, double-label immuno ﬂuorescence staining revealed that the expression of Bmal1 was signi ﬁcantly increased in OCN+ osteoblasts from osteoporotic fracture mice treated with PTH, and this effect was further augmented by the combination ofpropranolol, as evidenced by signi ﬁcantly increased number of BMAL1+osteoblasts (Fig. 5j, k) as well as the higher proportion of BMAL1+osteoblasts to total osteoblasts in the mice treated with PTH and propranolol (Fig.5l).These ﬁndings suggest that NE inhibits iPTH-induced Bmal1 expression in osteoblast cell line viaβAR signaling in vivo and in vitro.βAR signaling inhibits iPTH-induced osteoblast differentiation via Bmal1 To further investigate whether propranolol enhances the osteo- genic effect of PTH by regulating Bmal1, we downregulated Bmal1in BMSCs using speci ﬁc siRNAs, and the inhibitory ef ﬁciency of these siRNAs was con ﬁrmed by qRT ‒PCR and Western blotting (Fig.S5).As shown by ALP staining (Fig.
6a, b), Bmal1 knockdown partly but signi ﬁcantly inhibited the iPTH-induced osteoblast differentiation, suggesting that Bmal1 is involved in iPTH-inducedosteogenic differentiation. Importantly, Bmal1 knockdown blocked the rescue effect of propranolol on osteoblast differentiation in cells treated with iPTH +NE (Fig.6a, b).qRT ‒PCR and Western blot analyses further con ﬁrmed that Bmal1 knockdown suppressed iPTH−and iPTH +NE+Pro-induced Runx2 and Bglap expression (Fig.6c, d) as well as RUNX2 protein expression (Fig.6g, h).However, Bmal1 knockdown by siRNA had no notable effect on Rankl and Opg expression (Fig.6e, f).Moreover, there was no obvious difference in osteoclastogenesis between BMMs treated with CM from BMSCs treated with NC-siRNA or Bmal1-siRNA in anyof the groups (Fig.6i, j), indicating that Bmal1 has no signi ﬁcant effect on osteoblast-mediated osteoclast differentiation.
These results suggest that βAR signaling inhibits iPTH-induced osteo- blast differentiation through Bmal1 and that propranolol blocksβAR signaling and increases Bmal1 expression, thereby promoting iPTH-induced osteoblast differentiation (Fig. 7).DISCUSSION Fractures are the most common and most serious complication of osteoporosis and can result in increased mortality and disability.1 The cumulative mortality rate for 12 months following anosteoporotic hip fracture was 33%.24Recent fractures are considered one of the most reliable predictors of the risk of future fractures, with a higher risk within 2 years after fracture,which highlights the importance of timely treatment for systemicbone loss after fracture.This study revealed that fractures further accelerated bone loss in mice with OVX-induced osteoporosis.Consistent with our results, clinical research has shown thatincident fractures are associated with an accelerated decrease in hip bone mineral density (BMD) in elderly women.
25Furthermore, our results showed that mice with fracture exhibit highersympathetic tone, increased osteoclast formation and decreasedosteoblast numbers. The β-receptor blocker propranolol signi ﬁ- cantly increased the trabecular bone mass in OVX mice after fracture, suggesting an important role for sympathetic tone in fracture-induced systemic bone loss.PTH stimulates osteoblast differentiation and proliferation26and indirectly activates osteoclasts by regulating RANKL and OPG in osteoblast cell lines.27Differing from the ef ﬁcacy of PTH observed in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, clinical studiesinvolving the use of PTH after fracture have shown mixed results,ranging from positive effects to no effects on fracture healing.
28–30 These ﬁndings suggest that fracture-induced changes in the internal environment may affect the effect of PTH on bone metabolism.Interestingly, we found that propranolol augmented the anaboliceffects of PTH on systemic bone formation and fracture healing in mice with osteoporotic fractures. Importantly, we found that the activation of βAR signaling by NE blunted iPTH-induced osteoblast differentiation but enhanced RANKL expression in osteoblast lineage cells.Given the elevated sympathetic stress following fracture, the anabolic effect of PTH may be impaired in fracture subjects, whichexplains the potentiating effect of propranolol on PTH anabolism inmice with osteoporotic fractures.Consistent with our ﬁndings, Obri et al.provided evidence that sympathetic signaling favors PTH- stimulated Rankl expression in osteoblasts by increasing HDAC4accumulation.
31These ﬁndings suggest that the combination of PTH and propranolol may be a better option for treating systemic bone loss after osteoporotic fractures and preventing recurrent fractures, which requires further clinical studies. However, Hanyu et al.14reported that PTH showed no bone anabolic activity in global β2AR-de ﬁcient mice, demonstrating thatβ2AR signaling was indispensable for the anabolic action of PTH.These data seem to contrast with our results.However,propranolol works as a reversible antagonist that inhibits both β1AR and β2AR.Propranolol-mediated βAR inhibition differs from the permanent, irreversible and complete loss of function causedbyβ2AR gene knockout.However, PTH exerts its anabolic effects through a variety of cell types.In addition to osteoblasts, osteocytes are crucial target cells for the anabolic action of PTH in bone.
32PTH regulates the expression of several osteocytic genes, including RANKL, scler-ostin, DKK1 (Dickkopf Wnt Signaling Pathway Inhibitor 1), and MMP14 (matrix metalloproteinase), thereby controlling both bone formation and resorption.32Additionally, periosteal stem cells, which signi ﬁcantly contribute to bone formation and fracture repair,33are also responsive to PTH and play a role in the generation of fracture calluses.34,35Therefore, it ’s important to note that there may be other cell types that also contribute to theeffects of PTH and propranolol on bone metabolism, and further research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay of these cellular mechanisms.
The circadian rhythm plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, includi ng hormone production, autonomic nervous system activity, cardiovascular rhythm and bone metabo- lism.36–39Previous studies have shown that delayed bedtime and abnormal sleep duration are linked to low bone mineral density (BMD).40Swanson CM et al. reported that three weeks of circadian disruption and sleep restri ction resulted in a signi ﬁcant decrease in bone formation markers and an increase in sclerostin levels amongadult men.41Here, we found that PTH affects the expression of circadian clock genes in vivo and in vitro, and that knockdown of the circadian clock gene Bmal1 impairs the positive effect of iPTH onosteoblast differentiation.
Interesti ngly, a clinical study of patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis reported that 12-month morning administration of teriparatide resulted in a greater increase in the lumbar spine BMD than evening administration.42These ﬁndings suggest that circadian clock genes are involved in the regulation of osteogenic metabolism by PTH. Circadian rhythms are driven by internal biological clock genes.BMAL1 is a core component of the circadian clock loop andPropranolol enhances the anabolic effect of PTH J Huang et al.
7 Bone Research (2024) 12:18 participates in multiple biological processes during the development and remodeling of bone.43Bmal1-de ﬁcient mice exhibit a low bone mass phenotype and a reduced number of osteoblasts.44Further- more, clock genes mediate the sympathetic regulation of osteoblasticbone formation.45In this study, we demonstrated that NE-activated βAR signaling suppressed the PTH-induced increase in the expression of Bmal1 and Runx2, which was alleviated by propranolol; moreover,Bmal1 knockdown blocked the positive effects of PTH and propranolol on the differentiat ion of BMSCs into osteoblasts, indicating that NE interferes with the effect of PTH on osteogenesisby regulating Bmal1. These ﬁndings reveal a novel mechanism bywhich sympathetic stress modulates PTH-induced osteogenic differ- entiation and provide a potential pha rmacological target for systemic bone loss after fracture.
In summary, we demonstrated that propranolol enhanced the anabolic effect of PTH in mice with osteoporotic fractures by increasing osteoblastic bone form ation and reducing osteoclastic resorption. Mechanistically, NE impaired PTH-induced bone anabolismby inhibiting PTH-induced Bma l1 and Runx2 expression and promoting PTH-induced RANKL expression in osteoblast lineage cells, which was prevented by propranolol.

Fractures were created at the mid-diaphysis using scissors. X-ray con ﬁrmed the position of the intramedullary pin and fracture.OVX mice with fractures were further randomly assigned to four treatment groups: iPTH (rhPTH1-34; Shenzhen Salubris Pharmaceuticals Co, Ch ina), propranolol (MedChemEx- press, New Jersey, USA), iPTH +propranolol, or vehicle.PTH was intermittently administrated by subcutaneous injection at 80μg/kg once a day at approximately 10 am.Propranolol hydrochloride was dissolved in drinking water (0.5 g/L) and wasdelivered daily (changed once per 3 days).Mice wereeuthanized after 4 weeks of treatment.Tissues, including tibias, femurs, lumbar vertebrae and serum, were collected for further analyses.μCT The bone samples were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h prior to scanning using a micro-CT scanner (Siemens, Erlangen,Germany).The scanner was set at a voltage of 80 kV, a current of 500μA, a resolution of 8.82 μm per pixel, and an exposure time of 1 500 ms.
To determine the bone mass and microstructure, thetrabecular bone in the L5 vertebra beginning from the cranialgrowth plate and extending to the caudal growth plate was analyzed. For the femur analysis, the region of interest started from 0.15 mm proximal to the distal epiphyseal growth plate andwas extended by 0.5 mm.To analyze callus formation, 100continuous slices (50 slices up and 50 slices down from the fracture line) covering the middle of the newly formed callus wereselected as the region of interest (ROI).Micro-CT software was used to calculate the bone volume (BV) and bone volume fraction(BV/TV) of the callus, excluding the native cortical bone.Biomechanics A three-point bending test was performed to determine themechanical properties of the fractured tibiae using a mechanical testing system (Landmark, MTS, Inc., Eden Prairie, MN, USA).The loading point is located in the middle of the tibiae, with two pivotsspaced 8 mm apart.
Each sample is loaded at 6 mm/min until thebreaking point was reached. The ultimate strength was calculated from the load-deformation curve.Calcein double labeling To assess dynamic bone formation, mice in different groups received intraperitoneal injections of 0.1% calcein solution (10 mg/kg body weight; Sigma) in PBS at 10 and 3 days before euthanasia.Aftereuthanasia, the femu rs were collected and ﬁxed with 4% parafor- maldehyde for 24 h, dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in methyl methacrylate.Using a hard sectioning microtome (EXAKTCutting & Grinding System; EXAKT Advanced Technologies, Norder-stedt, Germany), 50- μm-thick bone slices were obtained.Calcein double labeling was examined under a ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon).ImageJ v1.52 software w as used to quantify the mineral apposition rate (MAR) of the trabecular bone.Histological and immunohistochemical analyses The femora were decalci ﬁed using a 10% EDTA solution with constant shaking for a period of 21 days.
The samples were subsequently dehydrated using graded ethanol, embedded in paraf ﬁn and cut into 5- μm-thick sections. Immunostaining was conducted using a standard protocol, in which the sectionswere incubated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-osteocalcin (OCN) antibody (1:100; Abcam; Britain).The primary antibody was detected using a Rabbit-speci ﬁc HRP/DAB Detection IHC Kit (Abcam; UK), followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin.TRAP staining was performed using a commercial kit (Sigma- Aldrich; USA) in accordance with the manufacturer ’sr e c o m - mendations.The nuclei were stained using methyl green, andTRAP +cells (red) were identi ﬁed as osteoclasts.The OCN+and TRAP+areas on the trabecular bone surface were calculated in three sections per mouse using ImageJ v1.52 software.After fracture Sympathetic nerve NENE /g69AR BMSC RANKL Osteoblast Osteoblast BonePropranololPropranolol Bmal1 Runx2 Osteoblast differentitioniPTHiPTH Fig.

After blocking with 5% donkey serum at room temperature for 30 min, the samples were incubated with an anti-BMAL1 antibody (1:100; Abcam; Britain) and an anti-OCN antibody (1:100; Abcam; Britain) overnight at 4 °C. Double-immuno ﬂuorescence staining was performed with a Treble- Fluorescence Immunohistochemi cal Mouse/Rabbit kit (Immunoway, USA) according to the manufacturer ’s protocol.The number of BMAL1 +osteoblasts on the trabecular bone surface was calculated in three sections per mouse using ImageJ v1.52 software.The proportionof BMAL+osteoblasts to total osteoblasts was also calculated.ELISA We used commercial ELISA kits from Elabscience (Wuhan, China) to measure the serum OCN, CTX-I and NE levels following the manufacturer ’s instructions.We read the optical density of each well at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad 680, Hercules,USA) and calculated the protein concentration for each sample based on the standard curve.
BMSC culture We isolated primary BMSCs from the femurs and tibias of C57BL/6 mice as described previously.48Brieﬂy, the femurs and tibias were extracted under sterile conditions and immersed in α-MEM (HyClone, Logan, USA) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS; Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The bone marrow was ﬂushed with α- MEM+1% PS.The cells were washed and cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% PS.Non-adherent cells were removed after 24 h of culturing with fresh complete α-MEM medium while the adherent cells were further cultured until they reached 90% con ﬂuence and passaged as needed.Osteogenic differentiation BMSCs and BMSCs transfected with Bmal1-siRNA or NC-siRNA were plated in 24-well plates until 80% con ﬂuence.
The BMSCs were then incubated with osteogenic differentiation medium, and treated underthe following conditions: intermittent PTH (iPTH;100 ng/mL), iPTH + NE (10 μmol/L), iPTH (100 ng/mL) +NE (10 μmol/L)+propranolol (1μmol/L) or vehicle (PBS). The iPTH treatment was conducted as previously described.49Brieﬂy, during the 48-hour incubation cycle, BMSCs were treated with PTH for the initial 6 hours, followed by 42 h of culture without PTH.The osteogenic differentiation medium waschanged every 48 h.The conditioned media (CM) from the differentgroups were harvested and centrifuged at 2 000 × gfor 10 min to collect the supernatant, which was used for subsequent experiments.After 7 –14 days of differentiation culture, the cells were stained or harvested for total RNA and protein extraction for further analysis.
ALP and ARS staining After 7 days of osteogenic induction, the differentiated BMSCswere washed with PBS, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and stained for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) with a commercially available ALP staining kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China).Alizarin red S (ARS) staining was carried out after 14 days ofdifferentiation, after which the cells were washed with PBS, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and then incubated with 2% ARS solution (Solarbio, Beijing, China) according to themanufacturer ’s instructions. After washing with PBS, the stained cells were examined using an inverted microscope (Leica DMI6000B, Solms, Germany).The fractions of ALP +and ARS+ areas were calculated using ImageJ v1.52 software.qRT‒PCR Total cellular RNA was extracted wi th TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and cDNA was synthesized via reverse transcription of 1 μgo ft h etotal RNA using a commercial kit (Qiagen, Dusseldorf, Germany).
qRT ‒ PCR (20 μL) was conducted on an ABI PRISM ®7900HT System (Applied Biosystems, USA). Relative mRNA levels were calculated by the comparative Ct (2–ΔΔCT) method using Gapdh for normalization.The sequences of primers used are listed in Table S1.Western blot Total protein samples were separated via sodium dodecyl sulfate ‒ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS –PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, USA).After blocking with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibodies, which included BMAL1 (1:1 000, Abcam,Cambridge, Britain), RUNX2 (1:500; ProteinTech, Chicago, USA),and tubulin (1:1 000; Af ﬁnity, Liyang, China).Then, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:5 000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,USA).
The blots were then detected with an enhanced chemilu-minescence kit (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc). Transfection of siRNA Four Bmal1 siRNAs (Bmal1-siRNA #1, 2, 3 and 4) were synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China).Cells transfected with negativecontrol siRNAs (NC-siRNAs) were used as controls.The siRNAs were transfected into BMSCs using Lipofectamine ®3000 (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions.The transfec- tion ef ﬁciency was determined by qRT ‒PCR and Western blot analysis.All siRNA sequences are listed in Table S2.BMM culture BMMs were isolated from the long bones of 6-week-old C57BL/6mice as described previously.46Brieﬂy, the bone marrow cells were ﬂushed out using an injector and then cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Solarbio, China), 30 ng/mL recombinant murine macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF; PeproTech, USA).
After 18 hours, we discarded the adherent cells and collected the ﬂoating cells that were subsequently cultured in a new ﬂask to obtain the macrophages. Osteoclastogenic induction The BMMs were cultured in 48-well plates in α-MEM (HyClone, Logan, USA) supplemented with 50 ng/mL of receptor activator for nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL; Novoprotein, Shanghai, China) in the presence of vehicle (PB S), PTH (100 ng/mL), PTH +NE (10 μmol/L), PTH (100 ng/mL) +NE (10 μmol/L)+propranolol (1 μmol/L) or con- ditioned media from BMSCs treated with vehicle iPTH, iPTH +NE or iPTH+NE+propranolol as described above.Osteoclast formation was identi ﬁed using a commercial TRAP kit (Sigma ‒Aldrich, USA) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions.The areas of TRAP+(red) osteoclasts were measured by ImageJ 1.8.0 software.Statistical analysis The data are presented as the mean ± SD.The unpaired, two-tailed Student ’sttest was used for comparing mean differences between two groups.
