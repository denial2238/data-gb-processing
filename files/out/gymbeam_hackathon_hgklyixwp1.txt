Rheological properties of cake batter containing 100% RKB ﬂour were tested by creep-recovery and dynamic frequency tests. Batter of RKB ﬂour boiled for 20 min was signiﬁcantly stiffer with 100 times less deformable character compared to the control.Increase in batter modulus ranged from 2000 times elastic component ( G0), 988 times viscous component (G00) and 1805 times complex viscosity ( g*) at 20 min boiling.Drying did not have a signiﬁcant effect on vis- coelastic properties.Firmness and height of gluten free RKB cupcake were not affected by heat treatment.RKB gluten free cake after heat-moisture treatment had improved consumer acceptance scores compared to thecontrol.Our ﬁndings showed that 20 min boiling and 3 h drying process is adequate for precooked RKB ﬂour.Keywords Gluten free cupcake /C1Rheological properties /C1 Red kidney bean /C1Heat-moisture treatment Introduction Cakes and cupcakes have a high consumption demand around the world.
The majority is made with wheat ﬂour, which contains gluten protein (Bourekoua et al. 2016 ; Vici et al.2016 ).However, gluten has negative health effects to patients with coeliac disease and other related-gluten dis- orders (Ge ´linas and McKinnon 2016 ).The symptoms of coeliac disease are diarrhea, stomachache, sleepless, hair loss, and anemia.The number of patients with gluten sensitivity is increasing every year around the world.One way to control this disease is to avoid consuming gluten- containing food products.Several bakery companies aim to develop new products without gluten protein to meet consumers’ health needs.Gluten free products such as cupcakes generally have challenges including tough tex- ture, low volume, short shelf life, and low in nutrients.To improve gluten free cupcake quality, hydrocolloids, i.e., guar gum, cellulose and xanthan gum are used to replace some functionality aspects of gluten protein.
These prod- ucts are also normally low in dietary ﬁber and protein, and high in carbohydrate because most of gluten free products are produced from non-gluten cereal such as rice, maize, potato or cassava starches (Capriles and Are ˆas2014 ). In addition, the amount of vitamin D, iron, zinc and calcium are low in gluten free products while the amount of satu- rated fatty acid, glycemic index and glycemic load are high (Vici et al.2016 ).&Pavalee Chompoorat pchompoorat@gmail.com 1Faculty of Engineering and Agro-Industry, Maejo University, Chiang Mai 50290, Thailand 2Robert M.Kerr Food and Agricultural Products Center, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK 74078, USA 3Instituto Tecnolo ´gico de Veracruz del Tecnolo ´gico Nacional de Me ´xico, Calz.Miguel Angel de Quevedo 2779 Col.

Composite ﬂour of pearl millet, kidney beans and tiger nut used at the ratio 85:10:5 (w/w/w) had similar rheological properties aswheat ﬂour based on Mixolab proﬁle test (Awolu 2017 ). A comparison between corn and cassava starch with chickpea and amaranth ﬂours, resulted in a more solid-like behaviorof both chickpea and amaranth ﬂours using a dynamic oscillation test (Collar et al.2015 ).Red kidney bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (RKB) is a rich source of ﬁber, protein and other micronutrients with other health beneﬁts such as lowering the risk of heart disease and colon cancer, and no gluten sensitivity impact (Ben-nink 2002 ).Physical and functional properties of dry bean ﬂours (Siddiq et al.2010a ), as well as nutritional charac- teristics and consumer acceptance of yeasted bread con-taining up to 30% RKB ﬂour have been reported (Bhol and Bosco 2014 ).
Radiation processing for reducing insect infestation on physicochemical properties showed thatradiation at 10 kGy increased cooking quality and antiox- idant activity of kidney bean (Marathe et al. 2016 ).Heat- moisture treatment has also been used in ﬂour processingfor improving physical properties of ﬂour (Go ´mez and Martı ´nez 2016 ).However, more studies are needed on treatments that can improve the functional properties ofRKB ﬂours as a based ingredient in gluten free cupcake.Therefore, this study was attempted to show the effect of thermal treatments of RKB ﬂour on the rheological prop-erties of cake batter as well as its correlation with sensory characteristics and ﬁrmness of gluten free RKB cupcake.Materials and methods Materials and treatments Dark red kidney bean (RKB) ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.), soybean oil, liquid egg whites, and other ingredients for the cupcakes were purchased from local market.Beans were washed with tap water.
Thermal treatments included boil-ing at 100 /C176C (0, 20, 30 and 40 min) and drying (3 and 4 h) in a convection oven at 80 /C176C. The beans were ground in ahammer mill (W.J.Fit Company, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) and sieved to obtain whole RKB ﬂour particle size less than 250lm.The bean ﬂour was stored in sealed polyethylene bags at 4 /C176C temperature until needed for analysis.Determination of red kidney bean ﬂour properties Whole RKB bean ﬂour samples were evaluated for their proximate composition of protein (Method 46-11A), fat (Method 46-11A), ﬁber (Method 46-11A) and moisture content (Method 44-15A) according AACCI standard methods.Rheological properties of red kidney bean batter Rheological properties of batter were performed by dynamic frequency sweep (mechanical spectra) and creep- recovery tests in a rheometer model AR1000 (TA Instru-ments, New Castle, DE, U.S.A.).The geometry was cross- hatched parallel plate with a diameter of 25 mm.
The dynamic frequency sweep test was performed using fre-quency between 0.1 and 10 Hz in a linear viscoelastic region (LVR) at 25 /C176C. Storage modulus ( G 0), loss modulus (G00) and tan delta ( d) were recorded.Also, the complex viscosity ( g*) was obtained based on the Eq.1.Complex modulus ( G*) represents the overall resistance to ﬂow and deformation and is calculated by the ratio of G*to fre- quency angle.g/C3¼G/C3 x¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ g0ðÞ2þg00ðÞ2q ð1Þ Creep-recovery test applied to measure viscoelastic properties of RKB batter properties at macromolecular level.RKB batter formula and preparation was the samefor both rheological tests.A batter was prepared with RKB ﬂour (treated or untreated) 10 g, oil 1.9 g, egg white 3.4 g and water 9.9 g.The batter was mixed in a modiﬁed 10-gbowl mixer (National Manufacturing, Lincoln, NE) for 5 min.
The mixing elements were two screws and one pin designed for mixing rate of 100 rpm and more control ofthe mixing for the small sample size. An aliquot of the batter was directly transferred to the rheometer peltier plate (25/C176C).The geometry was cross-hatched parallel plate (25 mm diameter) and the test conditions were 20 Pa of shear stress for 100 s during creep phase and 0 Pa of shear stress for 300 s during recovery phase.In this test, thedeformation of RKB batter was recorded in the parameters of compliance J(Pa -1) and strain (%) in both creep and recovery phases.RKB batter behaved as a non-stiff orsoggy material, which deformed with time under loading or during creep test.In this phase, the stress was applied with a controlled shear rate and the batter molecules rotated andﬂowed.The data from creep phase was modeled to 6-4938 J Food Sci Technol (December 2018) 55(12):4937–4944 123 parameter Kelvin–Voigt model (Eq.2).
This mechanical analog model is a combination of ideal Hookean bodies and ideal ﬂuid bodies, which represent spring and dashpot, respectively. During recovery phase, the stress wasreleased and the compliance or deformation was measured.Similar to the model during creep phase, the 6-parameter Kelvin-Voigt model was applied to ﬁt the compliance ofrecovery data without the element of viscous ﬂow or dashpot showed in Eq.3.A permanent deformation occurred during creep phase which is related to a non- recoverable strain of the sample; therefore, viscous ﬂow parameter was not found in this recovery equation (Her-na´ndez-Estrada et al.2012 ).The deﬁnition of the terms of each parameter in these two equations include: J candJr are creep and recovery compliance; Joand Jro, instanta- neous compliance during creep and recovery; Jr1andJr2, retarded elastic compliance during creep and recovery; and t1;t2;tr1andtr2, retardation times.

Dry and wet ingredients were mixed in a Kitchen Aid Mixer with a ﬂat beater at medium level (stir control setting 2) for 2 min and continued at high level (stir setting5) for 5 min.The batter was transferred to baking cupcake molds lined with paper cups with 40 g of batter per cup- cake.Baking was conducted in a convection oven at195/C176C for 20 min and the cupcakes cooled down for 1 h before measuring.Cupcake method preparation was the same across all of the treatments.
Physical properties of red kidney bean gluten free cupcake The height of cupcake was measured by a digital caliper. Crumb ﬁrmness of RKB gluten free cupcake was measuredby 40% compression using approved method 74.09.01 of AACCI for bread by a TA-XT2 texture analyser (Stable Microsystems, Surrey, UK) with a 25-mm diametercylindrical probe.Measurements were made in six repli- cates per treatment.Sensory evaluation The sensory test of gluten free RKB cupcake samples was determined by using a consumer acceptance test with a 9-point hedonic scale (9 = like extremely and 1 = dislikeextremely) and forty untrained panelists.The panelists were students and staff at Maejo University, Thailand, randomly selected to test the samples identiﬁed by threerandom digits.Statistical analysisSigniﬁcant differences of gluten free cupcake attributes for eight treatments of RKB ﬂour processing were tested byDuncan’s New Multiple Range (Statistical Analysis Sys- tem, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to test the overall relationshipbetween the treatments and parameters. This test is for multivariate interpretation, generated based on variables reduction by transforming numbers of original variablesinto a smaller number of variables called principal com- ponents.PCA test was performed by using Canoco for Windows 4.5 (Biometris, Plant Research International,Wageningen, The Netherlands).Results and discussion Red kidney bean ﬂour properties The red kidney bean ﬂour had higher protein (20.5%) and dietary ﬁber (14.7%) compared to cereal ﬂours.The valuesare comparable to the proximate chemical composition of previous studies (Manonmani et al.2014 ; Siddiq et al.2010b ).
Rheological properties of red kidney bean batter Effect of heat treatment on mechanical spectra from dynamic frequency sweep test The fundamental rheological properties of RKB batter from the eight treatments, four boiling times (0, 20, 30 and 40 min) and two drying times (3 and 4 h) were measured.In the dynamic oscillatory frequency sweep test, solid-like behavior parameter ( G 0) was higher than liquid-like behavior parameter ( G00) in all treatments (Table 1). This indicated that RKB batter without boiling had character- istics of a weak gel and low in strength.With the boiling treatments, the magnitude of G0and G00of RKB batters increased while their angle decreased with ﬂatter tracings compared to the upward curves without boiling.
Thus, precooking or heat-moisture treatments of RKB ﬂourJ Food Sci Technol (December 2018) 55(12):4937–4944 4939 123 improved elastic-solid like behavior of RKB batter with both drying times; with 4 h drying the curves of G0andG00 were more separated with lower values for G00. Therefore, thermal treatments induced major structural changes in thestructure of the major components including starch gela- tinization and retrogradation upon cooling, as well as protein denaturation during heating.The formation of apaste with a more organized structure and hydrogen bonds compared to the native structures account for the increase inG 0andG00.This observation could also be related to the structural alteration of red kidney bean protein.A study of rheological properties of red kidney bean protein isolate during heating found the gelation temperature between87.4 and 94.5 /C176C.Thus, gel formation could occur at this stage (Shevkani et al.2015b ).
Alteration of the structure of RKB batter was depicted in log–log plots of G 0andG00(Fig. 1).Drying at 3 and 4 h at 80/C176C showed overall superimposed patterns solid and viscous characters (Fig.1a, b).The curves displayed a shiftto higher values of G0andG00after boiling with ranges of 17.1–28.6 fold increase for G0at 3 h and 22.3–49.1 folds increase for G0at 4 h ( p\0.05) (Fig.1a, b and Table 1).The microstructure of the RKB batter signiﬁcantlyincreased its solid character with a higher rate of change than the viscous character with the heat-moisture treat- ment.In addition, incorporation of various protein isolatesi.e., kidney bean, ﬁeld pea, amaranth and wheat to starch in gluten free mufﬁn showed an improvement in viscoelas- ticity behavior compared to starch-based gluten free mufﬁnmeasured by frequency sweep test (Shevkani and Singh 2014 ).
Thus, this research study showed that not only types of protein isolate but also heating process could strengthenthe viscoelastic properties of batter. The superposition of the curves indicated that RKB batters after boiling formed more homogeneous structures compared to the samplewithout boiling since the curves superimpose with each other (Ahmed et al.2012 ,2013 ).
The complex viscosity showed a signiﬁcant increase in g*of 18.9 times at 20 minTable 1 Effect of thermal treatments (boiling and drying time) on characteristics of red kidney bean batter and gluten free cupcake Drying time (h) Boiling time (min) Batter characteristics Cake characteristics Cake sensory characteristics G0(9105)G00(9105)g* Tan delta Firmness (N) Height (cm) Overall acceptance 30 1.8g 1.0d 34g 0.58b 13.6a 4.7a 5.9b 20 38.5c 11.3abc 642c 0.29e 12.3a 5.4a 6.8a 30 30.7e 9.1c 513e 0.30d 11.8a 5.1a 6.9a 40 51.4b 14.3ab 855b 0.28g 12.7a 4.9a 7.1a 40 1.1h 0.6d 20h 0.59a 12.5a 4.8a 4.9b 20 24.5f 7.4d 410f 0.30c 13.3a 5.3a 6.3a 30 33.6d 9.9bc 557d 0.30d 13.0a 4.8a 6.8a 40 54.0a 15.4a 899a 0.29f 12.4a 5.2a 6.8a Mean values (n = 3) followed by different letters within the same column are signiﬁcantly different ( p\0.05) Fig. 1 G0as function of G00of red kidney bean batter drying at 80 /C176C for a3 h and b4 h.

In summary, the thermal treatments applied increased a maximum of49.1 folds the elastic behavior of the RKB batter while the viscous behavior only increased a maximum of 25.7 folds; thus, the fold increase was almost half in the viscousbehavior.Shevkani and collaborators compared gelation temperature and gelation reinforcement of red kidney bean protein isolate versus ﬁeld pea protein isolate (Shevkani et al.2015b ).
Red kidney bean protein isolate had a higher gel reinforcement calculated by the difference valuebetween G 0at the highest heating temperature (95 /C176C) and G00at the lowest cooling temperature (40 /C176C), suggesting that red kidney bean protein isolate had a greater inter-molecular interactions between protein molecules within gel network (Shevkani et al. 2015b ).Effect of heat treatment on parameters from creep-recovery test Fundamental viscoelastic properties of RKB batter were also measured using creep-recovery test with 20 Pa shear stress during creep for 100 s and 0 Pa shear stress duringrecovery phase for 300 s.The experimental data obtained was ﬁtted into the Burgers model explained in Eqs.2and3 of both creep and recovery phases.During a constant shearstress, RKB batter ﬂowed (molecules aligned to the stress as they were displaced) and partially recovered in a non- linear deformation behavior as a function of time.
Someparts of RKB batter structure stored energy which resulted in permanent deformation less than the total deformation due to recoil recovery (Steffe 1996 ). Thus, the Burgers model in Eq.3had no viscous ﬂow because the free dashpot represents permanent deformation which could be attributed to a loss of energy from liquid-like behavior.The creep-recovery curve of RKB batter showed typical viscoelastic behavior (data not shown).The longer drying time (4 h) increased the stiffness of red kidney bean battercompared to 3 h without boiling ( p\0.05) (Table 2).However, there was no signiﬁcant difference in deforma- tion on RKB batter with an increase of boiling time(Table 2).The RKB batter after heat-moisture treatment had a signiﬁcantly decrease in deformation expressed by MaxS, FinalS, Jmax, Jﬁnal, J c0,Jc1,Jc2,Jr0,Jr10andJr2in both creep and recovery phases ( p\0.05) (Table 2).
The relationship between rheological parameter and secondary structure proportion of red kidney bean protein isolateshowed that tan d(ratio of viscous and elastic moduli) was negatively correlated with proportion of b-sheets and anti- parallel b-sheets (Shevkani et al. 2015b ).Thus, it is pos- sible that boiling treatment favored red kidney bean proteinisolate to form more interaction associated with the sec- ondary structure b-sheets and anti-parallel b-sheets.As explained before in the formation of a paste after the gelatinization and retrogradation process of starch and thedenaturation of proteins, intermolecular bonds were altered by allowing more ordered H-bond sites engaged with water, starch and proteins resulting in a lower ﬂowability ofthe batter.Moreover, the zero shear viscosity parameter (g 0) showed remarkable increase up to 212 times after heat- moisture treatment compared to the sample without boiling (p\0.05) (Table 2).
This could be due to an improvement of water absorption during batter mixing. A study of pre-gelatinization using heat treatments, i.e., microwave, boil- ing, and roasting of buckwheat ﬂour revealed that physical modiﬁcation of starch increased water holding capacity(Sun et al.2018 ).This could be attributed to a change in surface of starch granule to a more porous structure.The pre-gelatinized starch with high viscosity in cold-solutionfound to be related to higher crystalline peaks based on X-ray diffraction measurement (Roma ´n et al.2016 ).The retardation time ( t 1and t2) remained constant after heat- moisture treatment (Table 2).These regressed parameters also remained unchanged in a study of gluten with various additives (Chompoorat et al.2013 ).However, the regressed parameter tr2(second retardation time of recovery phase) revealed signiﬁcant changes in the structure ( p\0.05) (Table 2).
Heat-moisture treatment increased the second retardation time during recovery up to 80.3% ( p\0.05). This second retardation time during recovery from the mechanical analog models is associated with parallel idealHookean bodies (springs) and ideal ﬂuid bodies (dashpots) attributed to an increase in entanglements of long chain polymers in starch structure after heat-moisture treatment(Herna ´ndez-Estrada et al.2017 ).Our results conﬁrmed an improvement of elastic mechanical spectra from dynamic oscillatory test after boiling.It is possible that the struc-tures of the batters were partially modiﬁed by the annealing process and needs further investigation.Annealing occurs above glass transition temperature (T g) but below the gelatinization temperature (Tester and Debon 2000 ).Physical properties of red kidney bean gluten free cupcake Physical properties of gluten free RKB cupcakes contain- ing RKB ﬂours from the eight treatments are presented in Table 1.
Cake ﬁrmness is an important parameter associ- ated with sensory attributes of cake products. RKB ﬂourwith different heat treatments showed that there was no signiﬁcant differences in ﬁrmness and height of gluten free RKB cupcake ( p[0.05).These results agree with the ﬁndings on carob ﬂour for gluten free cake with short and medium roasting time with no impact on cake volume (MaJ Food Sci Technol (December 2018) 55(12):4937–4944 4941 123 et al.2016 ; Roma ´n et al.2017 ).During cupcake mixing and baking, the bubbles were stabilized and showed a highexpansion with proper viscosity characteristic cake batter.An excess viscosity can prevent bubbles expansion.The viscosity of RKB batter measured by fundamental rheo-logical tests showed that heat-moisture treatment increased the zero shear viscosity and elastic modulus of the batter (Tables 1and2).
However, the gluten free RKB cupcakes had similar height, indicating that the batter viscosity obtained with RKB ﬂours had acceptable range for makingthis type of cupcakes. A study of gluten free rice mufﬁn with an incorporation of cowpea protein isolates revealed that volume was dependent mainly on types of proteinisolates not cowpea protein isolate level.It was suggested that foaming and emulsiﬁcation activity of protein isolates also inﬂuence volume and texture of mufﬁn products(Shevkani et al.2015a ).Sensory properties of gluten free red kidney bean cupcake Overall consumer acceptance of gluten free RKB cupcake based on a 9-hedonic scale point is reported in Table 1.The gluten free RKB cupcake had a signiﬁcantly higherscore of overall consumer acceptance.From the con- sumers’ comments, gluten free cupcakes made with RKB ﬂour without heat-moisture treatments had a dominantbeany ﬂavor, while it was not present in the cupcakes made with ﬂour treated with heat-moisture treatments.
The beany ﬂavor is a limitation of dry bean for consumer acceptance.The beany ﬂavor is produced from substances of chemical compounds created during physical disruption of the RKB tissues occurred in reaction of aerobic oxidation of linoleicand linolenic acids with lipoxygenase and alcohol oxi- doreductase as biological catalysts (Ma et al. 2016 ).
A study of light red kidney bean porridge also found thatusing heat process by extrusion helped lowering the detection of beany ﬂavor in porridge (Nyombaire et al.Table 2 Effect of drying and boiling treatments on parameters of estimated regression Burgers model for creep-recovery of red kidney bean batter Drying time (h)Boiling time(min)MaxS (%)FinalS (%)RCY (%)Jmax (Pa -1910-3)Jﬁnal (Pa-1910-3)Jc0 (Pa-1910-5)Jc1 (Pa-1910-5) 30 34a 21.4a 37b 17.0a 6.3a 22.4a 257.7a 20 0.23c 0.04c 82.3a 0.12c 0.09c 2.2b 1.7c 30 0.29c 0.07c 75.2a 0.15c 0.11c 2.8b 2.1c 40 0.23c 0.06c 71.3a 0.12c 0.08c 2.2b 1.6c 40 21.8b 11.2b 48.9b 10.9b 5.3b 17.2a 172.0b 20 0.29c 0.08c 70.5a 0.15c 0.10c 2.7b 2.1c 30 0.27c 0.06c 75.5a 0.14c 0.10c 2.6b 1.9c 40 0.22c 0.04c 79.9a 0.11c 0.09c 2.4b 1.7c Drying time (h)Boiling time (min)t1(s) Jc2 (Pa-1910-5)t2(s)g0 (Pa s 9105)Jr0 (Pa-1910-5)Jr10 (Pa-1910-4)tr10(s) Jr2 (Pa-1910-5)tr2(s) 30 0.18ab 616.3a 9.37a 0.1c 66.2a 197.7a 0.58b 330.0a 25.5c 20 0.25ab 3.3c 9.48a 21.3ab 2.3c 2.0c 0.99a 5.0c 46a 30 0.23ab 4.2c 9.73a 16.6b 3.1c 2.5c 0.72b 5.1c 36b 40 0.22ab 3.2c 8.87a 20.1ab 2.3c 1.8c 0.71b 3.9c 35.3b 40 0.15b 371.3b 8.59a 0.2c 60.7b 161.3b 0.66b 279.0b 28.6bc 20 0.26a 4.3c 9.8a 16.2b 2.7c 2.3c 0.82ab 5.0c 36.6ab 30 0.23ab 3.8c 9.6a 17.3ab 2.8c 2.3c 0.79ab 4.9c 37.4ab 40 0.19ab 3.0c 8.55a 22.5a 2.7c 2.0c 0.69b 3.9c 35.7b Mean values (n = 3) followed by different letter within a column are signiﬁcantly different ( p\0.05) Creep -recovery test : Gluten under 20 Pa of shear stress hold for 100 s and recover (0 Pa of shear stress) for 300 s Creep-recovery test : MaxS, maximum strain during creep; FinalS, ﬁnal strain during recovery; RCY, recoverability; Jmax , maximum compliance during creep; Jﬁnal , ﬁnal compliance during recovery; Jc0, instantaneous elastic compliance during creep phase; Jc1and J c2, retarded elastic compliance during creep phase; t1andt2, retardation time during creep phase; g0, pure viscosity; Jr0, instantaneous elastic compliance during recovery phase; Jr10and J r2, retarded elastic compliance during recovery phase; tr10andtr2, retardation time during recovery phase4942 J Food Sci Technol (December 2018) 55(12):4937–4944 123 2011 ).
This study conﬁrms that the thermal treatments used in producing RKB ﬂour reduce the beany ﬂavor and thus improve the potential of RKB ﬂour use as ingredient for cake products. Discriminant analysis The principal component analysis (PCA) by ordination procedure was used to depict relationships among param- eters from batter rheological viscoelastic behavior, physical properties of gluten free RKB cupcake and sensory char- acteristics with treatment samples (Fig.2).The parameters that were in vicinity to each other were positively corre- lated; whereas, the parameters that were opposite to each other were negatively associated.Moreover, the parametersthat are perpendicular to each other indicated that they were independent.The most important contributors for explaining the variance were the parameters with thehighest magnitude and closest to PC1.The total explained variance obtained from this sample set was 89.8% (Fig.2).
This sample set can be discriminated based on strength anddeformation/ﬂowability of gluten free RKB batter (Fig. 2).The parameters of strength and sensory characteristics were positively correlated, while, the deformation/ﬂowa-bility variables were in the same direction as ﬁrmness and height of gluten free RKB cupcake.Most of retardation time parameters from creep-recovery test were independentfrom strength and deformation/ﬂowability characteristics.Samples incorporated with ﬂour without heat-moisture treatment were highly correlated with deformation/ﬂowa-bility properties.In addition, the samples from ﬂour with thermal treatment moved towards strength vectors andscattered on quadrant 3 and 4 compared to samples without thermal treatment.Boiling time at 40 min showed that samples (3 h 40 min and 4 h 40 min) were weakly corre- lated with retardation time.
Overall, the results showed thatusing 20 min boiling with 3 h drying time is sufﬁcient to produce red kidney bean ﬂour for this gluten free cupcake application. Conclusion Boiling and drying RKB ﬂour improved batter viscoelas-ticity and overall consumer acceptance of gluten free cupcakes.No signiﬁcant differences in ﬁrmness and height of gluten free RKB cupcakes due to thermal treatments ofRKB ﬂour were observed.Boiling process increased elas- tic-like behavior and zero shear viscosity of RKB batter.Overall, boiling for 20 min with 3 h drying at 80 /C176Ci s sufﬁcient to obtain RKB ﬂour acceptable for gluten free cupcake production.Thus, this thermal process can be helpful to apply in ﬂour production for legume industry.Acknowledgements This research was funded by Agricultural Research Development Agency (Public Organization), OklahomaState University and U.S.Department of Agriculture-National Insti-tute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA).
