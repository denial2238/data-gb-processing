As well as blood bio-chemical indicators, carcass characteristics, growth per-formance, immunity, and the antioxidative status of their chicks. Results showed that diets supplemented with 2,000 or 6,000 IU/kg of VA increased fertility rate anddecreased early embryonic mortality ( P<0.05).Increas- ing VA from 4,000 to 6,000 IU/kg signi ﬁcantly boosted hatchability rates.All VA levels signi ﬁcantly enhanced glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) and reduced malondialde- hyde ( MDA ) and late embryonic mortality.In the shell gland, dietary supplementation of 6,000 or 8,000 IU/kg of VA enhanced actions of GPx actions, catalase ( CAT ),and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ).In hatched chicks, all VA levels boosted ( P<0.05) hemoglobin, red blood cell count, and serum concentration of total proteins and IgAwhile decreasing eosinophils percentage and aspartateaminotransferase activity ( AST ) concentration.
Dietary VA supplementations from 4,000 to 8,000 IU/kgimproved lymphocytes, serum total antioxidant capacity(TAC ), SOD, and IgM, while decreasing heterophils, heterophils/lymphocytes ratio, and creatinine in hatched chicks. Serum triglyceride concentration was reduced by adding 6,000 or 8,000 IU/kg of VA, while globulin andhigh-density lipoprotein concentrations were heightenedonly by 8,000 IU/kg of VA.It could be concluded thatthe dietary supplementation of VA (6,000 IU/kg)improved reproductive ef ﬁciency and antioxidative status in the liver and the shell gland of aged laying hens andimproved hemato-biochemicals parameters, antioxidative status, and immunity of their offspring.Key words: vitamin A, aged laying hen, reproductive ef ﬁciency, antioxidative status, immunity 2024 Poultry Science 103:103453 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2024.103453 /C2112024 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.

The transportation of an appropri- ate, balanced supplementation of minerals and vitaminsnecessary for the typical growth of the embryos in eggsdepends on the parent birds ’balanced feeding system (Chen et al., 2016 ;Hang et al., 2017 ). Abd El-Hack et al.(2022b) found that natural ingre- dients enhance feed intake, immunity, digestion, andantimicrobial effects, reduce antibiotic use, act as anti- oxidants, and provide nutritious organic products.Including micronutrients as antioxidants in laying hendiets can enhance their reproductive ef ﬁciency during their ﬁnal egg-producing season ( Abdelnour et al., 2019 ; Swelum et al., 2022 ).Since organic components prevent and control harmful bacteria in the digestive system,antimicrobial and antioxidant additives to meals havebeen utilized for several decades as antibiotics to boost the production of meat and eggs ( Abd El-Hack et al., 2023).
The impacts of inadequate vitamin intake and the nutritional requirements for vitamins were evaluated inbreeding poultry ( Abedi et al., 2017 ;Abdel-Moneim et al., 2021 ;Fu et al., 2022 ). The body ’s main VA supply is carotenoids, which act as antioxidants, immune regula-tors, anticancers, and antiaging ( Ebeid et al., 2023 ).In birds, the liver and egg yolk can retain VA, a fat-soluble vitamin necessary for female reproduction, embryonicdevelopment, immune maintenance, and epithelial tis-sue integrity ( Chen et al., 2016 ).Dietary supplementa- tion of VA is necessary to meet daily requirements inpoultry because only a modest amount of VA was syn-thesized ( Khan et al., 2012 ).The amount of VA required in poultry varies based on diet, the environment, and gene variation.According to NRC (1987) , a level of VA (3,000 IU/kg) is required for poultry.
However, a maximal tolerablelevel (40,000 IU/kg) was recommended for laying hensto re-establish the integrity of the membrane and theregularity of reproductive organ development under oxi-dative stress ( Kaya and Yildirim, 2011 ). Under these conditions, VA is a proper antioxidant to reduce lipid peroxidation ( Abd El-Hack et al., 2015 ) and has high efﬁciency as an antioxidant that traps radicals and smothers singlet oxygen ( Sahin et al., 2001 ;Sahin and Kucuk, 2001 ).Because the VA is necessary for typical epithelial growth, it is an `infective vitamin ( Stephen- sen, 2001 ).Dietary VA has been gradually increased in poultry production to achieve higher performance.The produc- tive ef ﬁciency of Cairo B-2 broiler breeders was increased when fed a diet forti ﬁed with VA at a level of 12,500 IU ( El-Husseiny et al., 2018 ).
In geese breeding, VA increases egg quality by increasing immunoglobulinproduction, improving fertility and hatchability, andreducing MDA levels in the liver and ovary ( Fu et al., 2022). Eggshell quality (decreased shell index) affects the breakage of eggs during the collection and transporta-tion during the late phase of egg production ( Moln /C19ar et al., 2016 ).Supplementation of VA enhanced the eggshell and yolk color quality of older laying hens ( Guo et al., 2021).Consequently, that investigation sought to identify the potential implications of VA diet supplements on reproductive ef ﬁciency, immune system, antioxidative status, plasma metabolites, hematology pro ﬁle, growth performance, carcass characteristics, blood variables,immunity, and progeny.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Management of Birds and Designing Experiments The experimental procedures were conducted based on the Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parlia- ment and the Council of 22 September 2010 on Safe-guarding Animals Utilized for Scienti ﬁc Purposes. The trial was carried out at El-Serw Poultry Research Sta-tion, Animal Production Research Institute, Agricul-tural Research Center, Ministry of Agriculture, Egypt.Sum of 330 local Sinai laying hens (300 females [1,750 g§0.45] and 30 males [2,000 g §0.55]) at 52-wk-old with similar live body weight ( LBW ) were randomly distrib- uted according to their LBW into 5 groups with 6 repli-cates per group (10 females + 1 male/replicate).Thebirds were kept in windowless buildings ﬁlled with wood shavings for litter.Natural mating was available withineach replicate.Every bird had unrestricted access tofood and clean water for the period.The photo periodwas 16 h light: 8 h dark and the illumination intensity was 30 lux.
Flocks were laid using “warm ”lights to guar- antee enough red spectrum light, with a temperaturebetween 2,700 and 3,500 K. Environmental conditionswere maintained at 22 to 23°C and 40 to 55% humidity.The trial began at 52 wk and ﬁnished at 68 wk.Data was collected and displayed every 4 wk.Five trial groups were given the standard diet (Table 1 ) forti ﬁed with VA (Palmitate USP 50.000 IU/capsule Kahira Pharm & Chem.Ind.Com- pany Cairo, Egypt) at levels of 0 (T1 = control), 2,000(T2), 4,000 (T3), 6,000 (T4), and 8,000 (T5) IU VA/kgdiet.The determined amount of each treatment groupwas dissolved in 150 mL of soybean oil and then wellmixed with the basal diet ingredients of each group.2 EL-RATEL ET AL.Reproductive Performance of Laying Hens Intact and normal egg yield during the age interval from 56 to 60 wk of age were collected from hens in each replicate.
The number of eggs used in fertility and hatch-ability trials was 316, 328, 314, 298, and 324 in T1, T2,T3, T4, and T5, respectively. The collected eggs wereplaced in a draft-type incubator (Econoom, Nether-lands).It has an incubator with a capacity of 20,000 eggs,and the eggs are turned over every hour for 18 d.It has ahatchery with a capacity of 4,000 fertile eggs for 3 d with- out turning the eggs.A fertility test was conducted to estimate the percentage of fertile eggs on d 3 of incuba-tion.Several hatched eggs divided by the total number ofeggs, or the number of fertile eggs, were used to determinethe hatchability percentage.Finally, unhatched eggswere broken to estimate the early embryonic mortality (7d of incubation) and the late embryonic mortality on d14.After hatching, chicks were measured with an elec- tron balance to the closest 0.1 g.
Antioxidative Status Assay in the Liver and Shell Gland of Laying Hens The following procedure involved homogenizing about 1 g of liver and shell gland in 10 mL of ice-cold saline,centrifuging the mixture at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4 oC,and removing the supernatants for analysis of glutathi-one peroxidase ( GPx ), MDA, and superoxide dismutase (SOD ), catalase ( CAT ), and MDA in the shell gland protein ( Xiao et al., 2019 ). Growth Performance of Progeny For 28 d, 15 hatched chicks were kept in ﬂoor pens for every replicate.As stated by the NRC (1994) , the starterdiet, or basal nutrition, was created to satisfy the nutri- ent needs of developing chicks.The structure and calcu- lated composition of the diet at the base are presented inTable 2 .Diet and water were similar and available ad libtum for chicks of all groups.
Live body weight ( LBW ) and feed intake ( FI) were noted at 1, 14, and 28 d, while body weight gain ( BWG ), and feed conversion ratio (FCR ) were measured at 1 to 14, 15 to 28, and 1 to 28 age intervals. The number of deceased chicks was noted during the procedure, and their survival rate was com- puted.Hematology, Biochemicals, Antioxidative Status, and Immunity Constituents of Chicks Six blood samples per experimental group represent- ing all treatment replicates were drawn from wing veinsand placed in nonheparinized and heparinized tubes at28 d of age to determine the hematological and biochem-ical parameters.Blood hemoglobin ( Hb) and packed cell volume ( PCV ), red blood cells ( RBCs ), white blood cells ( WBCs ) and WBCs fractions, including het- erophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosi- nophils were determined.
To obtain serum, blood was collected in nonheparinized tubes and allowed to clot,then centrifuged at 700 x g for 20 min (T32c; Janetzki,Wallhausen, Germany) to separate serum samples in1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and stored at /C020°C in a refrig- erator for later analysis.

Caracas Traits At 28 d of age, 6 chicks from each were selected at ran- dom and fasted for the entire night, and weighed, thenput to death with a very sharp knife to end the bleeding. Plucking the feather was done mechanically, and the total inedible parts were isolated.The liver, gizzard,heart, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius were removed andweighed.The net carcass was weighed to determine thecarcass yield percentage.Statistical Analysis Utilizing the General Linear Model and one-way ANOVA, the results were examined using SPSS version21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).The Tukey test detectedsigniﬁcant variations between means ( Toothaker, 1993 ).The following model was used: Y ij¼mþTiþeij Where, Y ij= an observation, m= overall mean, Ti = treatment effect (1, 2, ..., 5), and e ij= random error.Results are presented as the mean §pooled SEM.P≤0.05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant.
RESULTS Reproductive Performance of Aged Laying Hens Table 3 displays data indicating that the fertility rate was signi ﬁcantly ( P≤0.05) increased by 2,000 and 6,000 IU/kg of VA supplementation, where it was (97.91and 96.70%) respectively, but did not differ signi ﬁcantly with 4,000 and 8,000 IU/kg of VA compared to thegroup under control. The hatchability rates were signi ﬁ- cantly higher ( P≤0.001) with increasing VA from 4,000 to 8,000 IU/kg than 0 and 2,000 IU/kg of SupplementalVA, the greatest value observed in the 6,000 IU/kg VAgroup, where it showed (89.38, 92.48%) in the ﬁrst and second hatchings, respectively.All nutritional supple-ments VA levels, except for 4,000 IU/kg, substantiallydecreased ( P≤0.001) the early embryonic mortality rate.Furthermore, all nutritional VA levels substan- tially lowered the late embryonic mortality rate com- pared to the control ( Table 3 ).
These results indicated the positive impact of dietary 6,000 IU VA/kg (T4) onfertility %, hatchability %, and embryonic mortality ofeggs produced by aged laying hens. Antioxidative Status Biomarkers of Aged Laying Hens The impacts of the dietary VA supplementation on antioxidative status biomarkers in the liver and shell gland of aged laying hens are presented in Table 4 .I n the liver, the GPx activity was signi ﬁcantly increased (P≤0.001), while MDA concentrations were decreased with all VA levels compared to the control.In the shellgland, supplementing the diet with VA at levels of 6,000and 8,000 IU/kg considerably heightened the GPx,SOD, and CAT activities as compared to other groups.Moreover, MDA concentration was reduced by increas- ing the VA level from 4,000 to 8,000 IU/kg as contrastedwith the controls.However, there were no signi ﬁcant variations between the VA groups.
Growth Performance and Carcass Traits of Hatched Chicks Table 5 ﬁndings indicate substantial differences in the impacts of VA treatments on hatch weights, but all treatment groups did not differ signi ﬁcantly compared to the control group. Also, chick weights were unaffectedsigniﬁcantly by VA treatment at 14 and 28 d of age.The group differences in average BWG, FI, FCR, and viabil-ity rate of chicks at different age intervals (1 −14, 14 −28, and 1 −28 d) were insigni ﬁcant.Table 6 exhibits insigni ﬁcant alterations Within carcasses regarding Table 3.Effect of dietary vitamin A supplementation on reproductive performance of local Sinai laying hens.

Hematological Traits of Chicks Data tabulated in Table 7 expose that all VA groups showed a marked increase ( P≤0.001) in Hb concentra- tion and RBCs count, while eosinophils % was decreasedas opposed to the control. Lymphocyte % was increased,while heterophils % and H/L ratio were considerably reduced as VA dietary supplementation increased from 4,000, 6,000, and 8,000 IU/kg compared to the control,where heterophils were (21.93, 20.58, 20.08%), and H/L ratio (72.95, 74.63, 75.40%), respectively.However,PCV, WBCs count, and all VA levels did not impactmonocytes %.In general, VA supplementation at 8,000 IU/kg level resulted in the best hematological parameters of hatched chicks.Serum Biochemical Traits of Chicks Data presented in Table 8 revealed a notable rise ( P≤ 0.001) in total protein concentrations and a decline in AST activity in the serum of chicks in all VA groupsTable 4.

While globulin and HDL concen- trations were signi ﬁcantly increased ( P≤0.05) only by 8,000 IU/kg of VA supplementation, where it was (1.62and 92.26 IU/kg), respectively. However, none of theVA treatments affected blood serum albumin, total cho-lesterol, glucose, uric acid, AL/GL ratio, ALT, and IPand Ca contents.Antioxidative Status and Immunoglobulins Proﬁle of Chicks Table 9 displays the impact of adding dietary VA to aged laying hens on serum antioxidative status bio-markers and their progeny ’s immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA) at 28 d of age.Dietary VA supplementa-tion of 4,000, 6,000, and 8,000 IU/kg caused positiveimpacts on TAC level and activity of GSH and CAT,where TAC was (0.21, 0.22, 0.28 IU/kg), GSH (0.23, 0.24, 0.26 IU/kg), and CAT (0.24, 0.25, 0.26 IU/kg), respectively, and a noticed reduction in MDA level inthe serum of chicks as compared to 0 and 2,000 IU/kg of VA.
The activity of serum SOD was signi ﬁcantly improved ( P≤0.05) only in 8,000 IU/kg VA as com- pared to the control, where it was (0.20 IU/kg). All VAlevels augmented serum IgA concentration, while IgM concentration was higher as VA addition increased from 4,000 IU/kg to 8,000 IU/kg than in the control group.At the same time, VA treatments did not in ﬂuence IgG.The best immune status of chicks was obtained by treat-ment of parent ﬂocks with VA at a level of 8,000 IU/kg.DISCUSSION The success of producing healthy progeny in poultry depends on fertility ( Fu et al., 2022 ).Breeding poultry may experience decreased reproductive ef ﬁciency as they get older due to oxidative stress and immune sys-tem imbalances ( Wang et al., 2018 ;Peters et al., 2020 ).Injection or dietary antioxidant treatment is needed toaddress this issue in fowl reproduction.In this way, VAis crucial for maintaining bird fertility ( Yaripour et al., 2018).Similarly, Khan et al.
(2023) reported that VA supplementation in poultry supports growth, feed ef ﬁ- ciency, egg production, quality, immunity, hatchability, and congenital malformations.Table 7. Effect of dietary vitamin A supplementation of aged laying hens on hematological traits of their chicks at 28 d of age.

In this investigation, it is noted that dietary VA sup- plementation (6,000 IU/kg) greatly enhanced fertility%, hatchability %, and embryonic mortality rates ofeggs laid by aged laying hens ( Table 3 ).These ﬁndings imply that dietary VA can slow the reduction in egg pro-duction in older laying hens.However, the bene ﬁcial effects depend on dose, duration, strains, product purity,experimental design, and environmental factors.The reproductive system of laying hens is positively impacted by VA ( Yuan et al., 2014 ;Abdel-Moneim et al., 2021 ).Based on the results of this investigation, Chen et al.(2016) observed that broiler breeders from 46 to 54 wk of age had better reproductive success whenVA (10,800 IU/kg) was included in their diet.It wasdocumented that dietary VA supplementation (12.000IU/kg) raised the egg production effectiveness of layers (Savaris et al., 2021 ).
Hens ’ability to lay eggs at advanced ages may be improved by adding VA to theirdiet ( Gan et al., 2020 ). In hot climates, supplementing VA at a dosage of 16,000 IU/kg ( Abd El-Hack et al., 2017), or 9,000 IU/kg ( Lin et al., 2002 ), increased the reproduction of laying hens by raising the hatchabilityrate.In the same context, El-Husseiny (2018) concluded that broiler breeders had the best reproductive perform- ances when given a diet rich in VA (12,500 IU/kg).According to Miao et al.(2023a) , laying hens ’b-carotene deposition and bioconversion are examined; the resultsshow no appreciable effects on egg quality, but supple-mental doses increase b-carotene deposition.Long-term feeding boosted the genes involved in bioconversion andb-carotene absorption.Also, Egila et al.(2023) reported that during Japanese quail laying, antioxidants in diet impacted productivity, blood hematology, constituents, resistance, lipid diges-tion system, and antioxidative properties in serum andegg yolk.
Ashour et al. (2024) found that dietary energy and protein concentrations signi ﬁcantly affect digestion ratios in layer Japanese quail, suggesting a recom-mended energy content of 2,900 kcal metabolizableenergy/kg with 20% crude protein.Fat-soluble vitamins, including VA, are a micronutrient necessary for immune system upkeep, embryonic growth,epithelial tissue integrity, and reproduction in chickens(Yuan et al., 2014 ;Chen et al., 2016 ;Khan et al., 2023 ).The embryonic development of birds is positively impactedby the VA stored in the liver and egg yolk ( O’Byrne and Blaner, 2013 ;Ebeid et al., 2023 ).As Yuan et al.(2014) pointed out, laying hens require 3,000 IU of VA per kg ofdiet (based on 100 g of daily feed intake).The present study showed that aged laying hens ’ MDA levels decreased while vitamin A-rich diets increased liver GPx activity.
But dietary VA supple- mentation (between 6,000 and 8,000 IU/kg) enhancedantioxidant enzymes in the shell gland by boosting GPx,SOD, and CAT activity. Furthermore, the MDA levelwas reduced by increasing VA administration from4,000 to 8,000 IU/kg ( Table 4 ).The study reveals that dietary VA supplementation enhances antioxidant sta-tus in the liver and shell gland, improving egg fertility and ovarian function, thereby enhancing the reproduc- tive ef ﬁciency of laying hens.In agreement with these results, VA was reported to improve the antioxidantenzyme activities ( Guo et al., 2021 ).Also, VA contrib- uted to improving antioxidant ability in correspondencewith increasing the activity of CAT in the liver of agedlaying hens ( Gan et al., 2020 ).
In laying hens, the epithe- lial mucosa of the shell gland in the oviduct is crucial for the secretion of Ca 2+and bicarbonate ions included in the calcium carbonate of eggshell ( Ebeid et al., 2012 ), and VA has been shown to enhance the antioxidativestatus of shell gland in laying hens ( Guo et al., 2021 ). Shell gland MDA levels were reduced, and antioxidantenzyme activities were boosted when dietary VA intakewas heightened ( M/C19ezes and Hidas, 1992 ).The mucosal layer ’s antioxidant activity affected eggshell deposition (Zhu et al., 2020 ).The ﬁndings of the present investiga- tion show an enhancement of antioxidant status in boththe liver and shell gland by dietary VA supplementa-tion.The VA in the diet could improve egg fertility andovarian function, producing high-quality mature ovabecause there is a high correlation between the antioxi-dant status and reproductive ef ﬁciency of aged laying hens ( Gan et al., 2020 ).
According to Shastak and Pel- letier (2023) , VA is essential for avian nutrition because it improves poultry growth, immunity, antioxidantcapacity, and reproductive performance.Table 9.

It can regulate the growth and development of the developing embryo during incubation ( Chen et al., 2015).Accordingly, Wang et al.(2020) argued that VA from maternal sources, which is retained in the liver ofnewly hatched chicks, is only partially suf ﬁcient for needs related to early growth.Furthermore, Hogarth and Griswold (2010) demonstrated that VA bene ﬁts female gametogenesis and reproductive tract epithelial integrity.Moreover, Chen et al.(2015) concluded mater- nal diets containing VA in ﬂuenced the offspring ’s perfor- mance.The VA has a positive role as a stabilizer of thespread and distinction of body cells and embryonicdevelopment ( Tanumihardjo, 2004 ;Ebeid et al., 2023 ).
Dietary VA promotes antioxidants, immunity, andmaternal VA may be transported via embryos to off- spring broilers ( Wang et al., 2020 ). In this concern, the current study ’sﬁndings clearly show that nutritional VA addition of aged laying hensincreased hatch weights only but did not have an impacton the growth performance parameters of chick, includ-ing weights at 14 and 28 d of age, BWG, FI, FCR, andviability rate.This demonstrates that the sources ofilliterate VA are only partially suf ﬁcient for needs associ- ated with early growth.These outcomes are consistent with Wang et al.(2020) , who found no effects of VA on growth ef ﬁciency of offspring broilers, except body weight at hatching.Only adding vitamin premix to the offspring ’s diet, not the mother ’s, improved key development parameters (Peng, 2011 ).Also, providing VA (5,000 −25,000 IU ret- inyl acetate/kg) did not affect FI after 15 wk of exposure to Hy line white layers ( Mendon ¸ca et al., 2002 ).
Accord- ing to Miao et al. (2023b) , the levels of vitamin A and b-carotene in eggs were measured using tandem mass spectrometry and supercritical ﬂuid chromatography.The ﬁndings indicated that the diet of laying hens increases the amount of vitamin A and retinoids in eggyolks by partially depositing b-carotene.A plateau in b-carotene content and a slight change in yolk color were observed with increased supplementation.Interestingly, maternal supplementation of VA (8,000 IU/kg) enhanced the hematological parameters ofhatched chicks ( Table 7 ).Findings from this investiga- tion implied a substantial improvement in the differen-tial count of blood WBCs (heterophils %, lymphocytes%, eosinophils %, and heterophils/lymphocytes ratio) inhatched chicks.Including maternal VA enhanced the lipid pro ﬁle, liver function, and protein utilization of hatched chicks.Because VA is a fat-soluble vitamin thatthe body cannot produce on its own, it must be acquiredthrough diet.
The VA is deemed one of the most com-mon micronutrients in boosting check immune response(Lessard et al., 1997 ). Immunity of laying hens was adversely impacted by a de ﬁciency of VA ( Abd El-Hack et al., 2019 ), and the WBCs differentiation has a funda- mental function in immunity and phagocytosis ( Saleh et al., 2020 ).The dietary VA intake raised Hb concen- tration and RBCs count in the present research.Anelevation in Hb concentration is affected by oxygen lev- els and the count of erythrocytes ( Pantaya and Utami, 2018).Concerning the serum biochemical constituents of chicks, results showed an enhancement in serum concen-tration of total proteins, globulin, triglyceride, and HDLand activity of AST in response to supplemental VA(Table 8 ).These ﬁndings are consistent with Abd El- Hack et al.(2019) , who demonstrated a notable eleva- tion in globulin levels and a substantial decrease in the serum lipid pro ﬁle due to the VA addition of laying hens.
Also, the cholesterol level in the serum of chickswas decreased ( Kaya et al., 2001 ), and total protein con- centration was increased in plasma in broiler chickens(Kucuk et al., 2003 ) by dietary VA supplementation. As such, the antioxidant status and immunity in the serum of chicks were investigated, discovering that the TAC level and the function of antioxidant enzymes were signi ﬁcantly increased when mothers received die- tary VA supplements (GSH, SOD, and CAT), and con-centration of IgA and IgM.At the same time, it causes ar e d u c t i o ni nM D Al e v e l( Table 9 ).These results demon- strated the critical role that maternal VA plays infostering antioxidant statu s by decreasing lipid peroxi- dation and increasing immune function in hatched chicks.In line with the current ﬁndings, Hong et al.
(2013) discovered that supplementation to the diet of VA increased TAC levels, antioxidants enzyme( T - S O D ,G P x ,a n dC A T ) ,a n dr e d u c e dM D Ac o n c e n -tration in the serum of aged broilers. The TAC concen-tration and activity of antioxidant enzymes (GPx,SOD, and CAT) are indicators of the functional statusof the antioxidant defense system ( Liang et al., 2019).The VA can act as an effective antioxidant (Horv /C19ath and Babinszky, 2018 ) can promote the response of antibodies to T-cell −dependent antigens ( Catharine, 2012 ), and stimulate protective antitumor immunity via inducing differentiation of thecells and improving t he migration to lymph nodes ( Mullin, 2011 ).In this respect, the immune response was impaired, and resistance to infection was decreased by lack of VA, an essential part of preserving animal health ( Cassani et al., 2012 ;Yuan et al., 2014 ).
Consequently, it might be crucial to consider adding vitamin A supplements to the diets of both the motherand the children, as this could help maximize the off-spring ’s antioxidant function. Finally, the present results indicated insigni ﬁcant variations in the carcasses concerning weights, liver, pancreas, gizzard, heart, spleen, and burse of chicks.Information on the possible impacts of maternal dietary VA of laying hens on car-cass traits of their chick broilers is rare.However, inbroilers, Wang et al.(2020) found that maternal VA did not affect carcass characteristics.Nan et al.(2021) found that 20,000 IU/kg of vitamin A supplementation canboost American Mink growth by improving intestinaldevelopment, antioxidant capacity, and mucosal barrier functions.It also increased bene ﬁcial bacteria abun- dance, while vitamin A de ﬁciency negatively affected growth.8 EL-RATEL ET AL.
CONCLUSIONS The VA (6,000 IU/kg) provision of laying hens bene- ﬁts reproductive ef ﬁciency, antioxidative status, and immune function, increasing fertility and hatchabilityand reducing embryonic mortality in aged eggs. Mater- nal VA affects chicks ’body weight, hematology, serum biochemicals, antioxidative status, and immunity athatching but doesn ’t affect their progeny ’s productivity or carcass characteristics.VA provision after hatchingenhances hatched chicks ’growth and carcass traits while also crucial for chick nutrition due to its antioxidativeproperties in aged laying hens ’shell glands.Still, more research is necessary to understand the principles behind them.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors acknowledge Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Proj- ect number ( PNURSP2024R5 ), Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
