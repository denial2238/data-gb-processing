The study included 88 infants, 63 of whom were part of a recent cohort (2019–2021) that included 49 HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) and 14 HIV-unexposed and uninfected (HUU) infants, as well as 25 infants (all HEU) from an earlier cohort (2008–2011). No differences were observed between HEU and HUU infants regarding micronutrient levels, anthropometric indexes, growth, and rates of stunting, being underweight, or wasting.HEU infants from the earlier cohort, when compared to more recent HEU infants, had signiﬁcantly worse anthropometric measures at six months and inferior growth between six and twelve months.Overall, ferritin deﬁciency involved 68.6% of infants, while vitamin A and vitamin D deﬁciency involved 8% and 1.2% of infants, respectively.Micronutrient deﬁciencies were not associated with HIV exposure, cohort, stunting, being underweight, or wasting.
At six months, stunting, being underweight, and wasting involved 25.0%, 2.7% and 2.8% of infants, respectively, with no differences related to HIV exposure. Ferritin deﬁciency at six months was associated with inferior subsequent growth.In this small observational study conducted in Malawian infants, no major nutritional gap was observed between HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants, though the study highlighted speciﬁc nutritional deﬁciencies that deserve attention.High rates of stunting and ferritin deﬁciency were observed in the ﬁrst year of life in Malawian infants, irrespective of maternal HIV status; a signiﬁcant association between ferritin deﬁciency and worse subsequent growth was found.Vitamin A and vitamin D deﬁciencies were much less frequent.Based on the data observed, nutritional interventions should give priority to the correction of ferritin deﬁciency and chronic undernutrition.

This condition is associated with several adverse outcomes, which include impaired cognitive development [ 1], higher risk of overall morbidity [ 2], and increased occurrence of infections [ 3], with consequences that are often carried forward in terms of reduced stature and lean body mass in adulthood [ 4]. Wasting (low weight for length) represents a potentially severe condition caused by infections, malnutrition, or both factors [ 5], which may require urgent medical and nutritional interventions to revert an acutely increased risk of death [6,7].Globally, 149.2 million children aged under 5 years old suffered from stunting in 2020, while 45.4 million children suffered from wasting, with the global prevalence of these conditions being 22.0% and 6.7%, respectively [ 6].
In most African countries, rates of stunting are even higher, commonly exceeding 30% [ 6], and the concomitant high prevalence of HIV infection may further worsen the clinical effects of the interconnection between infections and malnutrition. Programs created for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV have dramatically reduced the number of HIV-infected infants.There is, however, some evi- dence that maternal HIV infection, irrespective of HIV transmission, may represent an independent risk factor for infant morbidity.HIV-exposed and uninfected infants, com- pared to HIV-unexposed and uninfected infants, have been reported to show higher rates of infections, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrhea, sepsis, and fungal infections [8–11].Such infections might be favoured not only based on immunological abnormalities linked to maternal HIV or worse maternal conditions, but also based on micronutrient deﬁciencies and malnutrition.
Exploring, in detail, the possible differences between the populations of HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants might, therefore, help us to deﬁne speciﬁc nutritional interventions for HIV-exposed and uninfected infants, ultimately improving their health. Low micronutrient levels may predispose infants to different adverse health outcomes.Insufﬁcient or deﬁcient vitamin D levels have been associated with growth impairment and increased susceptibility to infections, diarrhea, tuberculosis, CMV , and malaria [ 12–16].Similarly, vitamin A deﬁciency has been associated with early stunting [ 17], infections [ 18], and anemia, with vitamin A supplementations associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in morbidity and mortality in children [ 19].The impact of anemia and iron deﬁciency on child mortality is also known, with an estimated reduction of 24% in risk of death for each 1-g per decilitre increase in haemoglobin [20].
Despite these premises, data regarding the prevalence of micronutrient deﬁcits in African infants are limited and often inconsistent, possibly because of regional differences or variable deﬁnitions used. Few studies have also concomitantly evaluated levels of multiple micronutrients, nutritional status, and growth in infants with different HIV exposure status.In order to provide additional information on this subject, we investigated levels of fer- ritin, retinol-binding protein (RBP), and vitamin D, together with two acute-phase proteins (APP) that act as inﬂammation markers (C-reactive protein, CRP; alpha1-acid glycoprotein, AGP) in two groups of breastfed Malawian infants with different HIV exposure status (HIV-exposed uninfected, HEU born to HIV-positive mothers; HIV-unexposed, uninfected, HUU, born to HIV-negative mothers).
We also assessed the infants’ nutritional status (stunting, wasting, and being underweight) and the potential impacts of micronutrient deﬁciency on infant growth in the ﬁrst year of life. Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3282 3 of 15 2.Methods 2.1.Study Population This analysis included infants from two cohort studies.Both cohorts were followed within the structure of the Malawian DREAM (Disease Relief through Excellent and Ad- vanced Means) Program of the Community of S.Egidio, which is an Italian faith-based non- governmental organization that offers health services for HIV , TB, and non-communicable diseases in several countries [21–23].The more recent cohort (GF cohort) was followed in a study, which was conducted in 2019–2021, that assessed maternal retention in programs for the prevention of vertical HIV transmission and compared several health parameters in HEU and HUU infants during the ﬁrst year of life.This cohort enrolled 163 HEU and 72 HUU infants.
Maternal inclusion criteria were an age > 18, documented HIV test results, a gestational age between 32 and 36 weeks at enrollment, willingness to attend monthly visits with the child, and the ability to provide informed consent [ 24]. The second cohort (SMAC cohort) included 288 Malaw- ian HEU infants born to pregnant HIV-infected women who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the prevention of breastfeeding transmission and follow-up until they were 24 months of age between 2008 and 2011.Maternal inclusion criteria were an age > 16, being naïve to antiretrovirals (with the exception of single-dose nevirapine), willingness to breastfeed infants up to 6 months of age, and having no main laboratory abnormalities or active tuberculosis [25].For the present analyses, all infants in the two cohorts with available samples were selected.
We measured samples of ferritin, retinol-binding protein, vitamin D, C-reactive protein, and alpha1-acid glycoprotein extracted from these two cohorts of breastfed infants at 6 months of age. Inclusion of data in this analysis was based on sample availability.2.2.Clinical Procedures In the ﬁrst cohort (GF cohort), infants were treated in the urban center of Blantyre and the two periurban sites of Chileka and Machinjiri.In the second cohort (SMAC cohort), infants were treated in the urban center of Blantyre (same center as above) and the periurban center of Lilongwe.In both cohorts, infant visits occurred monthly during the ﬁrst year of life.Infant vaccinations and maternal antiretroviral treatment followed the Malawi National Guidelines [ 26,27].
In the most recent cohort, most HIV-positive women on ART were prescribed tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz (76.4%) [ 24], while in the older cohort, women ART were prescribed either zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine (46.9%) or stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine (53.1%) [25]. A PCR was performed in infants for HIV-DNA detection at 6 and 48 weeks, and all the infants included in this analysis were HIV-negative.2.3.Sample Collection and Analysis Infant blood was collected from peripheral veins during visits at 6 months.Serum or plasma samples were deidentiﬁed using pseudonomyzation, stored at –80◦C, and shipped in dry ice to the Laboratory of the National Center for Global Health of the Istituto Superiore di Sanit à, where they were stored at −80◦C until processing.RBP was used as an indicator of vitamin A status [ 17,28,29].
An automatized neph- elometry (BN ProSpec®System analyzer, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) was used to quantify plasma levels of α1-acid glycoprotein, retinol-binding protein, ferritin, and C- reactive protein (CRP2, sensitive) based on manufacturer’s instructions (BN ProSpec® System Assay Protocols, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany). Plasma levels of vitamin D were quantiﬁed using the Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG (Lübeck, Germany, cod N.EQ 6411-9601) and the MyBioSource assay (San Diego, CA, USA, Catalog N.MBS580159) based on the manufacturer’s’ instructions.Due to the known effect of inﬂammation on levels of ferritin and RBP [ 30], the levels of these biomarkers were corrected to adjust for the effect of inﬂammation by applying arith- metic correction factors (CF).
Based on the measured levels of CRP (elevated if >5 mg/L) Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3282 4 of 15 and AGP (elevated if >1 g/L) [ 31–33], subjects’ inﬂammation statuses were grouped into the following four categories: incubation (elevated CRP only), early convalescence (ele- vated CRP and AGP), late convalescence (elevated AGP only), and reference (no elevated APP). The arithmetic conversion factors used for incubation, early convalescence, and late convalescence, which were derived from the BRINDA project, were 0.68, 0.38, and 0.65 for ferritin [32] and 1.22, 1.38, and 1.09 for RBP [33], respectively.2.4.Deﬁnitions Feeding was categorized as exclusive breastfeeding (infants who only received breast milk), mixed breastfeeding (infants who received breast milk supplemented with other foods or liquids, including traditional medicines and water), or formula feeding (infants who exclusively received replacement feeds and no breast milk).
Mothers were encouraged to exclusively breastfeed infants during their ﬁrst 6 months of life [34]. Length for age, weight for age, and weight for length Z-scores (LAZ, WAZ, WLZ, respectively) were calculated using the WHO Anthro Survey Analyzer, excluding values of less than −6 and greater than 6 as implausible [ 35].We deﬁned stunting as a LAZ of less than −2, being underweight as a WAZ of less than −2, and wasting as a WLZ of less than−2 [9,36].Vitamin D status was categorized according to serum 25(OH)D concentrations, which were defined as severely deficient (<30 nmol/L), deficient (<50 nmol/L), insufficient (50–74 nmol/L), and sufﬁcient ( ≥75 nmol/L) [ 14,37].Vitamin A deﬁciency was deﬁned based on RBP concentrations < 0.7 micromol/L [ 33], and iron deﬁciency was deﬁned based on ferritin concentrations < 12 micrograms/L [32].2.5.Statistical Analysis The ﬁnal sample size was not deﬁned a priori and was based on all laboratory samples available for analysis.
Data were summarized as proportions and means with standard deviations (SD) or medians, as well as interquartile (25–75 percentile) ranges. Stunting, being underweight, and wasting were evaluated at six and twelve months.Concentra- tions of biomarkers and other quantitative variables were compared via the T test or the Mann–Whitney U test.Categorical variables (including micronutrient deﬁciencies, being underweight, stunting, and wasting) were compared via either the chi-square test or the Fisher test (when expected cell frequencies were <5).Odds ratios (with 95% conﬁdence intervals) were calculated using contingency tables.In all analyses, pvalues < 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant, with no correction for multiple comparisons.All analyses were performed using SPSS software version 27 (IBM Corp, 2017, Armonk, NY, USA).3.
Results The study included 88 infants born to 86 mothers (two sets of twins), of whom 63 infants were from the GF cohort and 25 were from the SMAC cohort; 14 infants were HUU (all in the GF cohort) and 74 HEU (49 in the GF cohort and 25 in the SMAC cohort). The general characteristics of mothers and infants are reported in Table 1.Within the more recent cohort (GF), no signiﬁcant differences were found between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women.Considering only HIV-positive women, individuals from the earlier cohort (SMAC) had lower haemoglobin levels (10.0 vs.11.0 g/dL) and worse clinical HIV disease stage than those from the more recent cohort (SMAC: 12% symptomatic HIV disease vs.0% in the GF group).
Similarly, the HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants of the more recent cohort showed no differences related to birth weight, low birth weight, sex, month of weaning, and season of birth, while HEU infants of the earlier cohort, compared to HEU of the more recent cohort, were more commonly female and started mixed feeding at an earlier stage in life, with statistically non-signiﬁcant trends for more frequent birth in winter and lower birth weight (Table 1).

The status of infants with respect to body weight and height, inﬂammatory indexes, and nutritional parameters is reported in Table 2.HEU and HUU infants from the more recent cohort did not differ in terms of body parameters, inﬂammatory indexes, and levels of RBP , ferritin, and vitamin D.
HEU infants in the earlier cohort, compared to the HEU infants in the more recent cohort, had similar micronutrient levels, but signiﬁcantly worse parameters for all body indexes (weight, height, weight for age, weight for length, and length for age), although rates of being underweight, stunting, and wasting were not Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3282 6 of 15 signiﬁcantly different between the two HEU groups (Table 2). Overall, almost half of the infants (48.9%) had levels of AGP or CRP that deﬁned inﬂammation, and more than two-thirds of infants had ferritin deﬁciency (68.6%).Vitamin A deﬁciency was much less common (8.0%).None of the infants had severely deﬁcient vitamin D levels, only one infant (1.2%) had vitamin D deﬁciency (HEU infant from the more recent cohort), and only four infants (4.8%, all GF HEU) had vitamin D insufﬁciency.None of the HUU infants had either vitamin D deﬁciency (<50 nmol/L) or insufﬁciency (<75 nmol/L).
Infant growth was analyzed by assessing changes in body parameters (weight and height gain, differences in BMI, BMI z-score, WAZ, LAZ and WLZ) between 6 and 12 months of age. The results of these analyses are reported in Table 3.Once again, no differences were found between HEU and HUU infants, while HEU infants in the earlier cohort, compared to their counterparts in the more recent cohort, had lower growth in weight and height (0.8 vs.1.2 kg and 5.7 vs.8.0 cm, respectively), which was accompanied by signiﬁcantly worse changes in WAZ ( −0.84 vs.−0.30) and LAZ ( −0.84 vs.−0.07) (Table 3).We then analyzed possible associations between micronutrient status and growth.No signiﬁcant associations were found between RBP deﬁciency or vitamin D insufﬁciency at 6 months and subsequent growth between 6 and 12 months, while iron deﬁciency (ferritin levels <12 micrograms/L) was signiﬁcantly associated with lower weight gain between 6 and 12 months (1.1 vs.
1.8 kg in infants with normal ferritin at 6 months), as well as signiﬁcant decreases, compared to maintained or increased values in the other group, in both the BMI Z-score ( −0.63 vs. +0.31) and the weight for age Z-score ( −0.58 vs.+ 0.12).(Table 3).We, ﬁnally, assessed possible associations between micronutrient deﬁciencies and nutritional status, considering micronutrient levels at six months and the occurrence of stunting, being underweight, and wasting at either 6 or 12 months.The rates of micronutri- ent deﬁciency or insufﬁciency were not signiﬁcantly different between infants with and without stunting and wasting and who were or were not underweight (Table 4).Table 2.Infant status at 6 months: weight/height parameters, micronutrients, inﬂammation, and haemoglobin.N: GF 63 (HUU 14, HEU 49); SMAC 25 (HEU)All InfantsGF Cohort, AllGF Cohort, HUUGF Cohort, HEUSMAC Cohort, HEUpValue pValue Median (IQR)Median (IQR)Median (IQR)Median (IQR)Median (IQR)GF HEU vs.GF HUUGF HEU vs.

Discussion Using two cohorts of HIV-uninfected and breastfed Malawian infants, we evaluated several clinical, demographic, and biochemical variables, including micronutrient levels (ferritin, retinol-binding protein, vitamin D), markers of inﬂammation (C-reactive protein and alpha1-acid glycoprotein), and growth and nutritional status in the ﬁrst year of life. The earlier cohort only included HIV-exposed infants, while the more recent cohort, which was separated from the ﬁrst cohort by a ten-year temporal interval, included both HIV- exposed and HIV-unexposed infants.This method allowed us to evaluate and describe clinical, biochemical, and nutritional aspects not only according to sociodemographic and clinical factors, but also based on HIV exposure status and calendar time, thus providing potentially relevant information.
The ﬁndings related to the HIV-exposed cohorts indicate an overall improvement over time in the health of both mothers with HIV and their infants: HIV-infected mothers from the earlier cohort had signiﬁcantly lower haemoglobin levels at third trimester of pregnancy (10.0 vs. 11.0 g/dL) and more frequently showed symptoms of HIV-related conditions (12.0% vs.0%).Data regarding infants at birth showed the same trend: HEU infants from the earlier cohort had, when compared to their more recent counterparts, lower birthweight (3.2 vs.3.4 kg), and they were more commonly below the threshold of low birthweight (<2500 g), i.e., 21.7% and 3.6%, respectively.These differences, although clinically relevant, were, however, not signiﬁcant ( p: 0.063 and 0.079, respectively) due to the limited sample size.
The differences between the two HEU groups became signiﬁcant at six months of age, when HEU infants from the earlier cohort had worse scores for all clinical anthropometric parameters evaluated, i.e., weight, height, BMI, and Z-scores for BMI; weight for age; length for age; and weight for length. These differences were maintained in the second semester of life, with signiﬁcant worse growth indexes (differences in weight, height, weight for age, and length for age between six and twelve months) in children in the earlier cohort.Rates of being underweight, stunting, or wasting were, however, not signiﬁcantly different between the two HEU groups.The analyses of biomarkers of inﬂammation and comparison of micronutrient levels also showed no signiﬁcant differences between the HEU infants in the two cohorts.Our ﬁndings conﬁrm the progress achieved in recent years in improving maternal and infant health among women with HIV and their children [ 38–42].
Such advances can be attributed to several interventions implemented in Africa during the last two decades, which include wider dissemination of HIV programs [ 38], increased coverage of maternal antiretroviral treatment [ 43], integration of HIV services and other health services [ 40,42], involvement of community health workers [ 44], and introduction of infant vaccination for rotavirus and pneumococcus [45]. Our analysis of micronutrient status showed that the rates of micronutrient deﬁcien- cies, although similar in the subgroups analyzed, were markedly different for ferritin, RBP , and vitamin D.Ferritin deﬁciency was extremely common, affecting more than two thirds of infants at six months, with no signiﬁcant differences based on HIV exposure or the temporal cohort; RBP deﬁciency was much less frequent, affecting only 8% of infants at six months, and, once again, no signiﬁcant differences were observed between subgroups.
Fi- nally, vitamin D deﬁciency was observed in only one infant, and insufﬁciency was observed in less than 5% of infants at six months of age. No differences were observed between subgroups, though the numbers were small.No signiﬁcant differences were observed based on infant HIV exposure and temporal cohort in the absolute plasma levels of the three micronutrients studied.Due to the potential effect of inﬂammation on ferritin and retinol-binding protein, the plasma concentrations of these two proteins were adjusted according to the inﬂammatory status deﬁned based on levels of two acute-phase proteins that were concomitantly measured [31–33].The present data contribute new information regarding the micronutrient status of African infants.A high rate of iron deﬁciency in childhood has been described in several African countries, being particularly high in infants and pre-school children, before declin- Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3282 10 of 15 ing as the child’s age increases [ 46,47].
Our data, which show a 68.6% rate of iron deﬁciency according to ferritin levels in six-month-old infants, with no signiﬁcant differences between the HIV-exposed and HIV unexposed groups, conﬁrm the high prevalence of this condition at the age of weaning, and they reinforce the need to implement nutrient supplementations, which have been proven effective in ameliorating iron status and anemia [46,48]. Our analysis of vitamin A status (assessed through concentrations of retinol-binding protein) showed an overall prevalence of vitamin A deﬁciency of 8% at six months of age, with no signiﬁcant differences between subgroups.This rate is fully consistent with the 8.9% rate observed in Ugandan children aged 6–59 months old who were evaluated in 2016 [ 17], but below the prevalence range of 14–42% reported in a systematic review based on data from four African countries collected between 2005 and 2016 [ 49].
The differences in the geographical contexts and populations studied make difﬁcult to draw conclusions, though the lower rates observed in more recent years might indicate an improvement in population health over time. With respect to vitamin D status, the information provided contributes to the open issue of prevalence of vitamin D deﬁciency in Africa, which is characterized by large variability among countries based on the reported prevalence of this condition [ 37].The low rates of deﬁciency and insufﬁciency observed in our study in six-month-old African infants provide some reassurance, conﬁrming that vitamin D deﬁciency is less common in infants this age or older than in neonates or 6–10-week-old infants [ 50–54], with no apparent negative effect related to HIV exposure.Vitamin D supplementation was not provided to infants in this study.
Infant age, feeding, and solar exposure are likely to play a major role in ﬁnal vitamin D status, because breast milk is considered to be a poor source of vitamin D, and the levels of vitamin D increase with age during the ﬁrst year of life, being comparable to those of adults by 12 months of age [ 54]. Children from Sub-Saharan Africa also have generally higher vitamin D levels than those from Western populations [55,56].We, ﬁnally, assessed infant growth between six and twelve months in the population studied.Infant growth between six and twelve months was similar for all parameters in HEU and HUU infants, but lower for weight, height, weight for age, and length for age in HEU infants of the earlier cohort than in their more recent counterparts.This ﬁnding indicates that the gap that we observed between the two HEU cohorts at six months, which is characterized by better infant anthropometric measures in the more recent population, is maintained until twelve months of age.
The analysis of the possible associations between growth and micronutrient status showed a signiﬁcantly worse rate of growth between six and twelve months in infants with ferritin deﬁciency. This result indirectly conﬁrms previous observations of signiﬁcant associations between iron deﬁciency and stunting [ 57], and it reinforces the rationale for administering iron supplementations to infants in order to prevent not only occurrence of anemia, but also suboptimal growth and stunting.In the entire population, the markers of malnutrition had different prevalence rates: at six months, stunting (25.0%) was much more common than being underweight (2.7%) or wasting (2.8%), suggesting chronic undernutrition.These rates were not signiﬁcantly different based on HIV exposure status or temporal cohort, though the numbers of cases of being underweight and wasting were low.
We were also unable to identify associations between stunting, being underweight, and wasting and micronutrient deﬁciency (ferritin, RBP) or insufﬁciency (vitamin D). The data do not conﬁrm other ﬁndings of higher preva- lence of stunting in HEU than HUU infants [ 58], but they indicate that stunting, although decreasing, still affected a signiﬁcant proportion of pre-school infants in Africa, irrespective of maternal HIV status, possibly due to socioeconomic and demographic factors [ 57,59–63].Overall, the ﬁndings suggest that the current population of HIV-exposed infants does not need speciﬁc interventions regarding the nutritional aspects evaluated, because the deﬁciencies observed involved similarly HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants.The main limitation of the present study is represented by its limited sample size.Inclusion criteria were essentially based on the availability of samples from the two cohorts.
Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3282 11 of 15 We had already evaluated several immunological parameters in the infants of the two co- horts [ 64–67], and we used all residual samples to perform the present laboratory analyses, examining the clinical correlates of the laboratory ﬁndings. This method translated into an intensive evaluation of a small sample, which had limited statistical power for some anal- yses.Some associations that approached signiﬁcance could be explored via future larger studies.Despite the limited sample size, the study was able to detect signiﬁcant differences of clinical relevance, such as the signiﬁcantly better clinical status in the more recent cohort of women with HIV and their infants.Almost all infant anthropometric indexes and growth measures were signiﬁcantly better in the more recent cohort, supporting the hypothesis that recent programs have signiﬁcantly improved the health status of HIV-exposed infants.
The gradual reduction in the gap between this population and the general population of HIV-unexposed infants is also supported by the absence of signiﬁcant differences between the two contemporary HEU and HUU groups for all variables considered, which included a wide range of clinical and laboratory parameters. An additional possible limitation of our study is that our intensive evaluation required a high number of comparisons between groups, and the high number of tests performed may have increased the possibility of ﬁnding falsely positive associations.Our study also identiﬁed some areas of relevance for potential interventions, such as the maintained high rates of stunting in both HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants, as well as the signiﬁcant association between ferritin deﬁciency and worse subsequent growth, which suggest that iron deﬁciency might indicate infants at risk of impaired growth who could beneﬁt from appropriate nutritional supplements.
