Methods: We extracted testicular sperm of 48 mice and divided them into three equal parts. One part was incubated with Ham's F10 medium (control), the other parts were treated with Ham's F10 containi ng LC and PTX with a final concentration of 1.76 mM, for 30 min at room temperature.Sperm motility was assessed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.Sperm LDH-C 4 enzyme activity was measured by spectrophotometery method.Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA and Fisher's LSD test, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant difference.Results: Sperm motility increased after 30 min of incubation in LC- and PTX-treat- ed group (p<0.001).LC and PTX administrations showed a significant increase in the LDHC 4 enzyme activity of sperm compared to that of the controls after 30 min (P=0.04 and 0.01, respectively).
Conclusion: The effects of LC and PTX on motility of sperm can be explained by an increase in LDH-C 4 enzyme activity that may influence male fertility status. We suggest that LC as a non-toxic antioxidant is more suitable for use in assisted repro- ductive technique protocols than PTX.Keywords: L-carnitine, LDH-C 4, Male infertility, Pentoxifylline, Testicular sperm.To cite this article: Aliabadi E, Karimi F, Rasti M, Akmali M, Esmaeilpour T.Effects of L-carnitine and Pentoxifylline on the Activity of Lactate Dehydrogenase C 4 isozyme and Motility of Testicular Spermatozoa in Mice.J Reprod Infertil.2013;14(2):56-61.Introduction nfertility is a common and worrisome prob- lem for couples.About 30% to 50% of cases of infertility are due to male factors includ- ing sperm motility disorder (1).
Physiological maturation of sperm and acquisition of motility are done during passage through epididymis; thus, immature sperm such as those from testicular sperm extraction (TESE) possess a little motility and fertilization capacity. Therefore, finding a way to increase sperm motility is essential for pa-tients’ TESE samples (2).Studies have shown that sperm motility is de- pendent on the amount of its energy production.Under various conditions, mammalian sperm pro-vide their energy requirements by anaerobic gly-colysis, aerobic glycolysis and beta oxidation of * Corresponding Author: Mozhgan Rasti, Depart- ment of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shi- raz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran E-mail: rasti31@yahoo.com Received: Jul.22, 2012 Accepted: Dec.9, 2012 Effects of LC and PTX on LDH-C 4 JRI 57 J Reprod Infertil, Vol 14, No 2, Apr-Jun 2013 endogenous substrates (including fatty acids).
In the presence of oxygen, the end product of gly- colysis is pyruvate and the lactic acid present in the female genital tract can be used as substrate by the sperm lactate dehydrogenase C 4 (LDH-C 4) to produce pyruvate for the mitochondrial consump- tion. In anaerobic glycolysis, environmental glu- cose or fructose are used by sperm as a source of energy to release lactic acid by the LDH-C 4 activi- ty (3-4).In aerobic conditions and lack of sub-strates for glycolysis, sperm gain the energy from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the context in which L-carnitine acts as a cofactor (5).It has been shown that LDH-C 4 is a testis-spe- cific isoenzyme (6) and it is present during sper-matogenesis.LDH-C 4 appears in the cytosol of testicular cells, from spermatocytes to spermatids.
Finally, LDH-C 4 will be placed in the middle and principal parts of mature spermatozoa (7) and also in the inner mitochondrial and plasma membrane of mature and developing spermatogenic cells in testis (8, 9). This isoenzyme plays an important role in the process of glycolysis and ATP produc- tion in sperm flagellum and, sperm motility.In addition, a disorder in LDH-C 4 gene has been re- ported to cause impaired sperm motility, followed by infertility in male mice (10).Production of excessive free radicals due to la- boratory manipulations, cellular waste products, presence of large numbers of leukocytes and im-mature germ cells is one of the most important issues to be considered in assisted reproductive technique (ART) procedures.Therefore, sperm samples prepared for ART cycles are susceptible to oxidative damage, especially when the samples are free of seminal plasma and exposed to low levels of protective antioxidants (11).
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to have an impact on cellular components such as the li- pid, protein and carbohydrate components of the cell membrane (12). There are reports that ROS can damage sperm motility by interruption of ATP production or flagellar axonome phosphory-lation (13).Immature sperm, such as those from testicular sperm extraction (TESE), produce much greater ROS than mature sperm (14).Sperm stimulators, such as pentoxifylline (PTX) and L-carnitine (LC), are antioxidants and ROS scavengers (11).Extensive studies have been done in vivo and in vitro on different compounds, in- cluding LC and PTX, affecting sperm motility in ART (15−18).LC has a key role in sperm metabo- lism by supplying the required energy and has a positive effect on sperm production, maturation and motility (19).It has been suggested that high concentrations of L-carnitine in the epididymal fluid serves to stabilize the sperm plasma mem-brane (20).
According to existing theories since 1994, PTX acts as a phosphodiesterase enzyme inhibitor and causes an increase in cellular cAMP concentration (21). In later stages, this increase could cause increased cellular glycolysis and ATP production which can promote sperm motility and lead to increased fertility rates (18).Other studies suggest that PTX can protect the sperm plasma membrane integrity (22).Despite widespread use of PTX in the culture media in IVF laboratories throughout the world, PTX is a toxic agent and can lead to a decrease in sperm survival if it is prescribed for longer than 90 min (23).Considering the harmful effects of free radicals in the structural integrity of sperm membrane, ATP production, and ultimately sperm function, we used antioxidants to reduce oxidative stress.PTX, an anti-oxidant with toxic effects and LC, a non-toxic antioxidant, can prevent LDHC 4 dam- age in sperm.
We subsequently evaluated mouse sperm motility and LDHC 4 enzyme activity after LC and PTX administrations. Methods Animals and Sperm Preparation: The animal ex- periments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.Forty-eight male balb/C mice weighing 25 to 30 g were acclimated to the laboratory condition (12 hr light, 12 hr darkness and a temperature of 22 to 24 ºC).We removed the testes of the animals and washed them by saline and Ham’s F10 medium (Sigma, USA).The tunica albuginea was separated from the testes and seminiferous tubules were gently removed by two syringes.Red blood cells were separated by the addition of Ham’s F10 to the samples and centrifugation at 500 rpm for 10 min.The palette was cut into pieces in Ham’s F10 me-dium, and vortexed for 1 min to extract the sperm from the tubules (24).
The sample was then incu- bated at room temperature for 1 hr (23), and cen- trifuged at 500 rpm for 10 min to precipitate the Leydig and Sertoli cells. The supernatant was cen-trifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min and the palette which contained sperm was resuspended in 1 ml of Ham’s F10 (24).Sperm count was done using a hemocytometer.Experimental design: The sperm samples were pooled and aliquoted into three parts.Ham’s F10 Aliabadi E, et al.JRI J Reprod Infertil, Vol 14, No 2, Apr-Jun 2013 58(0.2 ml), used as the control solution containing 3.6 mM o f L C ( S i g m a , U S A ) o r P T X ( S i g m a , USA), was added to the equal volume of aliquoted sperm samples.The final concentration of 1.76 mM of LC or PTX was obtained in the samples (17).Sperm motility assay: Sperm motility was as- sessed 30 min after incubation at room tempera- ture.All motility evaluations were performed ac-cording to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (25).
To evaluate sperm motility, sperm were classified as immotile (IM, no movement), non-progressive motile (NP, all other patterns of motility with an absence of forward progression, e.g. swimming in small circles, the flagella force hardly displacing the head, or when only a flagella beat can be observed) and progressively motile (PR, spermatozoa moves actively, either linearly or in a large circle, regardless of the speed) (25).The percentage of the motile sperm was calculat-ed according to study done by Moreira et al.(26).Lactate dehydrogenase C 4 assay: LDH-C 4 enzyme activity was measured by spectrophotometry.Sperm samples (6×106/ml) were sonicated in 500 µl Tris-HCl (0.1 M, pH=7) for 10 s, three times and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min.Ten μl of the extract was added to 1 ml of reaction buffer (0.05 M Na 2HPO 4 (Merck, Germany) pH=7, 0.1 mg/ml NADH (Sigma, USA), and 27.5 μg/ml pyruvate (Sigma, USA).
LDH-C 4 activity was calculated as the change in absorbance at 340 nm over a period of 1 min and expressed as U/ml . Statistical analyses: All results were presented as mean±SE (standard error of mean).Statistical analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Fisher's LSD test using SPSS version 15 for windows.A p-value less than 0.05 was considered as a statisti- cally significant difference.Results Effects of LC and PTX on sperm motility and LDH- C4 enzyme activity: The findings showed a signifi- cant increase in the percentage of progressive sperm exposed to PTX compared to the control sperm (p<0.001) after 30 min of incubation.There was a significant decrease in the percentages of immotile sperm and a significant increase in the percentage of non-progressive sperm in the pres- ence of LC and PTX compared with the control sample 30 min after incubation (p<0.001).The data for sperm motility has been summarized in table 1.
As shown figure 1, LC-treated sperm had a sig- nificant increase (2.20±0.12 U/ml ; p=0.04) in mean LDH-C 4 enzyme activity compared with the con- trols (1.80 ±0.13 U/ml ) 30 min after incubation. In addition, the results (Figure 1) demonstrated a significant increase in the LDH-C 4 enzyme activi- ty of PTX-treated sperm (2.27±0.14 U/ml ; p=0.01) after 30 min of incubation in comparison to the controls (1.80 ±0.13 U/ml ).Discussion Improving the ability of sperm to fertilize the oocyte is the aim of many ART studies.In the testicular sperm extraction technique, it is im- portant to have good quality, matured sperm for successful application of ART.Our findings showed that incubation of extracted sperm sam-ples with LC or PTX led to both an increase in testicular sperm motility and LDH-C 4 enzyme ac- tivity compared to the control group.Wang showed that LC can increase ejaculatory sperm motility of men with asthenozoospermia (27).In another study, Shi et al.
also demonstrated that testicular sperm motility improved after expo- sure to LC in vitr o (28).

showed that mice testicular sperm motility can be im-proved after exposure to LC and PTX in vitro (16). Our findings in this study are consistent with all the aforesaid results.L-carnitine increases sperm motility by affecting the metabolism of fatty acids (29).Fatty acid me-tabolism occurs in the mitochondria of sperm middle-piece.It has been demonstrated that LC regulates the amount of acetyl coenzyme A (30).Acetyl-CoA is necessary for tricarboxylic acid cycle and energy production (31).Therefore, the increased motility of sperm by LC in this study might be due to the effects of LC on oxidative phosphorylation and energy production.We also indicated that a significant increase in LDH-C 4 enzyme activity in LC- and PTX- treated sperm in comparison to the control group.LDH-C 4 catalyz- es a reversible reaction that produces lactate in sperm (32).It supplies the required NAD ⁺ for gly- colysis process and continuous production of ATP in anaerobic conditions.
Immunohistochemical studies have shown that LDH-C 4 protein is present in the cytosol of spermatocyte, spermatid and the principal piece of spermatozoa (8) and also in the inner mitochondrial and plasma membrane of ma-ture and developing spermatogenic cells in the testis (8, 9). It has been observed that increased ROS causes damage to the sperm membrane and its mitochondrial membrane due to lipid peroxida- tion in lipopolysaccaride-treated rat testis.LPS also decreases the LDH-C 4 enzyme activity.How- ever, in this study treating sperm with LC inhibit- ed the LPS-induced toxicity in the testis (9) and increased sperm motility and LDH-C 4 activity.Gil-Guzman showed that immature sperm such as TESE produce much more ROS than mature sperm (13).Oxidiative stress can influence cell membrane structures such as proteins (12).Therefore, Reac-tive oxygen species scavengers such as LC and PF may affect sperm metabolism (11), motility (15, 28) and its plasma membrane (20, 22).
Other re- searchers have reported that ROS by interruption of ATP production or flagellar axonome phos-phorylation can damage sperm motility (13). Dokmeci's study showed that LC, as an antioxi-dant, can decrease oxidative products in infertile men (high volumes of ROS in their seminal fluid) and affect both sperm maturation and motility (5).Our findings support similar previous studies.It is hypothesized that LC either through its role in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in the aer- obic condition or by antioxidant effects in protect- ing LDH-C 4 from the damage by ROS production improves the capacity for energy production in sperm.Especially in anaerobic conditions which ATP is produced and supplied by glycolysis, the maintence ability of LDH-C 4 enzyme for support- ing glycolysis process is important to sperm mo-tility.Pentoxifylline also acts as an anti-oxidant agent (17) and can protect the fresh sperm plasma mem- brane (33).
In our study, the PTX effects on LDH- C 4 activity and sperm motility were likely due to its antioxidant activity. It has been shown that PTX can increase testicular sperm motility when it is added to the medium (17).However, Tas-demir et al.showed that PTX can also increase sperm motility by inhibiting the activity of phos- phodiasterase diesterase enzyme to increase the intracellular concentration of cAMP, glycolysis and production of energy (34).It is possible that PTX, through raising intracellular cAMP, increas- es the activity of cAMP/PKA pathway that re- quires ATP for its function.Therefore the in-creased need for ATP in this pathway in sperm can stimulate glycolysis and LDH-C 4 enzyme ac- tivity to provide energy requirements of sperm.In our study both LC and PTX increased the mo- tility and LDH-C 4 enzyme activity of sperm; how- ever, LC is normally seen in epidydimis and tes-ticular sperm is exposed to it (20).
In addition, our previous work showed that LC administration could improve nuclear maturation more effective- ly than PTX (16). Conclusion In our study, in vitro administration of L-carnitin and pentoxifylline to extracted testicular sperm samples led to increased sperm motility and LDH- C 4 enzyme activity.Application of non-toxic anti- oxidant, L-carnitin is more suitable for ART pro-tocol than PTX.Acknowledgement This study was supported by a grant, No.5881, from Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in Shiraz, Iran for Ms Fatemeh Karimi’s thesis in fulfilling her master's degree in anatomy.Conflict of Interest None of the authors had any conflict of interest.Aliabadi E, et al.JRI J Reprod Infertil, Vol 14, No 2, Apr-Jun 2013 60References 1.Isidori AM, Pozza C, Gianfrilli D, Isidori A.edical treatment to improve sperm quality.Reprod Biomed Online.2006;12(6):704-14.2.Su LM, Palermo GD, Goldstein M, Veeck LL, Ros- enwaks Z, Schlegel PN.
