We recently reported that, in theVITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), daily supple- mental vitamin D (2000 IU/d) vs. placebo did not reduce fracture risk in 25,871 U.S.men (aged ≥50) and women (aged ≥55).[1] While vitamin D stimulates transcription and translation of osteocalcin (OC) and matrix Gla pro-tein (MGP), vitamin K is need ed to carboxylate and acti- vate these proteins.Older adults tend to have lowvitamin K intakes, and low vitamin K status may attenu-ate effects of vitamin D on bone.In this VITAL ancillarystudy, we tested in a case-cohort sample of 1,162 partici-pants with fractures and an age-sex-matched subcohortsize of 2,652, whether baseline low vitamin K status,alone or in combination with lower 25(OH) vitamin D lev-el, predicts incident total, non-vertebral, and hip frac-tures.The mean ( ±SD) age of participants was 68.3 ±7.2 years, 61.5% were female, and 81.7% was Non-HispanicWhite.
Fractures were reported on annual questionnairesand adjudicated through medical record review. To assessvitamin K function, percent undercarboxylated OC (%ucOC) and dephosphorylated undercarboxylated MGP([dp]ucMGP) were measured in fasting baseline bloodsamples, with %ucOC calculated from measures of ucOCand total OC.Higher levels of %ucOC and (dp)ucMGP in-dicate lower vitamin K status.Serum 25(OH)D was meas-ured by LC-MS/MS and vitamin K biomarkers bysandwich ELISAs (IDS-iSYS Multi-DisciplineAutomated System).Participants with incident fracturehad higher baseline vitamin K status, as assessed by(dp)ucMGP levels, but this was not corroborated by %ucOC.Compared to participants with low baseline vita-min K status and baseline 25(OH) vitamin D levels belowthe median (30.0 ng/mL), participants with higher base-line vitamin K and D status had a similar incidence of to-tal and non-vertebral fractures.
For the 91 hip fracture cases, baseline status of vitamin K and D did not predict hip fracture incidence. In this ancillary study, low vita-min K status by (dp)ucMGP and %ucOC, alone or in com-bination with baseline 25(OH) vitamin D levels below themedian, was not associated with increased fracture inci-dence.Ongoing analyses are assessing whether phyllo-quinone levels as another vitamin K biomarker predictincident fracture risk.Furthermore, we have also previ-ously shown that the effects of supplemental vitamin D on total and hip fractures were not modi ﬁed by baseline vitamin K status in VITAL, the largest randomized con-trolled trial of supplemental vitamin D vs.placebo on frac-tures.From our ﬁndings in VITAL, higher vitamin K status does not protect against fractures.1.LeBoff MS,et al.NEJM .2022.Presentation: 6/1/2024Journal of the Endocrine Society | https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvae163 | A271 J Endocrine Soc, Volume 8, Issue Supplement_1, October –November 2024 A271
