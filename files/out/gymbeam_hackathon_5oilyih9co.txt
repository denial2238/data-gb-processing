Type I interferons (IFN-I) have been strongly implicated a role in disease etiology as has the main IFN-I-producing cell subset, the plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC). The B6.Nba2 mouse model develops a lupus-like disease characterized by elevated IFN-I levels and pDC pathogenicity.We have previously shown that pDC ablation prior to disease development in B6.Nba2 mice effectively prevents disease; however, it remains unclear if a similar protection can be seen if pDC ablation is initiated during later disease stages.This is important as Systemic lupus erythematosus patients are rarely diagnosed until disease is well-established and thus preventative treatment is unlikely to take place.Here we show that ablation of pDCs in the B6.Nba2 mouse model must be initiated early in order to effectively block disease development and that sustained reduction in pDC numbers is necessary for sustained effects.
Finally, targeting of pDCs have been hypothesized to affect immunity towards infectious agents, in particular virus and intracellular bacteria.

Keywords lupus; plasmacytoid dendritic cell; B cell; Encephalomyocarditis virus Introduction Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by multiple organ inflammation and increased levels of antinuclear autoantibodies targeting DNA, histones, chromatin, and/or RNA-binding proteins.1 The etiology of lupus remains unknown; however, SLE patients often present with evidence of elevated levels of type I interferons (IFN-I) early in the disease,2–5 and results from animal models and clinical trials suggest an important pathogenic role for this group of cytokines.6–14 Although many cells can secrete IFN-I in response to viral and intracellular bacterial infections, the plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) has been found to secrete levels many fold higher than any other cell (reviewed in Refs. [ 15,16]).
We and others have previously shown that depleting the interferon-alpha producing subset of pDC expressing surface lectin SiglecH (SigH+ pDCs) in animal models of lupus before or during onset of disease results in short-term protection from disease initiation and progression, respectively.17,18 Furthermore, results from a recent clinical trial (LILAC study, clinical trial # NCT02847598 ) targeting pDCs showed promising results within the 6-month study period,19 and a phase III study is currently enrolling patients for a 12-month study (TOPAZ-1 study, clinical trial # NCT04895241 ), further investigating the efficacy of targeting pDCs in SLE. Despite these promising studies it remains to be determined if pDCs are targetable in more advanced disease, as well as whether pDC-ablation affects immunity towards other pathogens.We here evaluated diphtheria toxin (DT)-driven SigH+ pDC-ablation in the B6.Nba2.BDCA2-DTR transgenic animal model of lupus using three separate treatment strategies.
Mice were ablated of SigH+ pDCs during early disease development (12–18 weeks of age), during established disease (18–24 weeks of age), or using pulsed-treatment schedule covering both early and established disease (12–24 weeks of age). At 24 weeks of age when lupus-like disease is well established, all mice were analyzed for serum autoantibodies, immune cell activation, glomerulonephritis, and renal immune complex deposition.Mice treated using a pulsed-treatment schedule starting at 12 weeks of age, showed sustained reduced disease patterns.In contrast, mice treated early lost the protection and mice treated late failed to respond, supporting the importance of early and consistent lowering of SigH+ pDC levels for therapeutic efficacy.
Furthermore, it has been speculated that SigH+ pDC ablation may affect the natural immune response to infections and immunizations and some studies have shown reduced clearing of virus in pDC-ablated animals.20 Using a T-dependent antigen immunization model and an ssRNA virus (EMCV) infection model, we show that SigH+ pDC-ablation in B6.Nba2 lupus-prone mice has no effect on antibody production and survival, respectively.

Methods Animals B6.Nba2.BDCA2-DTRtg mice were generated in house by crossing BDCA2-DTRtg mice (C57BL/6-Tg(CLEC4C-HBEGF)956Cln/J) with B6.Nba2.ABC (B6.Nba2) mice as previously described.18 All mice were housed in the Biological Resource Center at the Lerner Research Institute and all studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Cleveland Clinic. For the reported studies all mice were female, as disease development is more pronounced in B6.Nba2 females than in males.21 Diphtheria toxin (DT) treatment and mouse harvest Mice were treated intraperitoneally with 100ng DT in 200 μL sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 3x/week from 12–18 weeks of age (followed group), 18–24 weeks of age (late group), or from 12–14, 16–18, and 20–22 weeks of age (pulse group) (Figure 1).For all experiments, DT-treated B6.Nba2.BDCA2–DTRtg–negative littermates were included as controls.
Serum was obtained from all mice by tail vein bleeding before treatment start, one day after the mice reached 18 weeks of age and one day after the mice reached 24 weeks of age, at which time the mice were euthanized and organs harvested for analysis (see Supplemental Figure 1). Splenic single-cell suspensions were prepared by gently separating single cells between the frosted areas of 2 microscope slides, and red blood cells were lysed using 1x ACK lysing buffer (0.15M NH 4Cl, 0.01M KHCO 3, 0.1 mM EDTA).Flow cytometry Flow cytometry was performed using a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) and FlowJo (Version 9.7.6)(Tree Star, Hazel Green, WI, USA) were used for all analyses.Total spleen count was acquired for each mouse and used for calculation of total number of each splenic cell subset.
Cells were incubated with unlabeled anti-CD16/32 antibodies to reduce nonspecific Fc receptor–dependent binding of fluorescence-labeled antibodies Fluorescently-labeled antibodies with the following specificities were used for spleen cell characterization: B220, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11c, CD19, CD21/35, CD23, CD25, CD44, CD62L, CD69, CD86, CD93, CXCR5, GL7, IgD, IgM, MHC Class II (I-Ab), PD-1, PDCA1, and Siglec-H (all from e-Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). ELISA Anti-chromatin IgG ELISA: Detection of anti-chromatin specific antibodies were done as previously described.18 Briefly, microtiter plates (Immulon 2HB) were coated with purified chromatin (1μL/mL) overnight at 4°C, washed three times in 1 × PBS, and blocked for ≥2 hours at room temperature in 5% gelatin/PBS.After blocking, plates were washed and serum samples (1:450 in sterile filtered serum diluent: 1x PBS with 0.5% bovine γ-globulin, 5% gelatin, 0.05mM Tween) were added and incubated for ≥2 hours.
Plates were washed three times in 1x PBS/0.05mM Tween. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti- mouse IgG (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) was diluted 1:2000 in serum diluent Campbell et al.Page 3 Lupus .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 August 30.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript and applied for 1.5 hours.Plates were washed and developed using 10mg/mL 2,2’-azino- bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) (SigmaAldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA) in McllWain’s Buffer (0.09 M Na 2HPO 4, 0.06M Citric Acid, pH 4.6).Plates were read on a Victor3™ plate reader at 405nm (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).IgG ELISA: Microtiter plates (Immulon 2HB) were coated with total anti-mouse immunoglobulin (10mL PBS + 25μL anti-Ig (Southern Biotech) overnight at 4°C, blocked ≥2 hours at room temperature in 5% gelatin/PBS.Standards and samples were added for 1.5 hours.
Plates were washed before secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000) or IgM (1:1000) antibodies (Southern Biotech) were added for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Plates were developed using the 3,3’5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) Substrate Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and read on a Victor3 plate reader at 450nm (Perkin Elmer).Anti-NP 5 IgG ELISA: 96-well microtiter plates (Immulon 2HB) were coated with 5μg/ well (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl) 5 conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1x PBS overnight and blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% gelatin in PBS.Serum samples were diluted 1:10,000 in serum diluent (5 mg/ml bovine γ-globulin, 5% gelatin, 0.05% Tween in PBS).100μl diluted serum was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature after which plates were washed in 0.05% Tween in PBS.
Secondary HRP- conjugated anti-IgG1 antibodies (1:2000) (Southern Biotech) were added for 1.5 hours, plates were washed and developed in 10mg/ml ABTS in McllWain’s buffer. Colorimetric readings were done at 450 nm on a Victor3 plate reader (Perkin Elmer).All samples were run at the same time, allowing for direct comparisons of OD values to determine relative antibody levels between samples.Immunization 12 week old B6.Nba2.BDCA2-DTRtg mice were immunized i.p.with 20μg (4-hydroxy-3- nitrophenylacetyl) 27-conjugated chicken γ-globulin (NP 27-CGG)(Biosearch Technologies, Petaluma, CA) in a 1:1 ratio with Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA, (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO)) or sterile 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in a total volume of 200μl.Mice were treated 3x per week for 4 weeks with DT starting on day −1 and 3x per week for 2 weeks starting on day 150.
Mice were bled via the tail vein before the first injection (day 1), and every 7 days for the first 4 weeks (days 7, 14, 21, and 28), thereafter monthly (days 60, 90, 120, and 149), followed by on day 157 and 164 at which time the animals were euthanized. At day 150, mice in each group were randomly distributed for reimmunization with either NP 27-CGG/CFA or PBS.Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection EMCV was a kind gift from Dr.Ian M.Kerr (Cancer Research UK)22 to Dr.Silverman.EMCV was prepared as previously described.23 Briefly, EMCV was grown in L929 cells and viral titers were measured by plaque assays.12 week old B6.Nba2.BDCA2-DTRtg were treated with DT on days 1, 2, and 5 and infected with 100pfu or 2000pfu EMCV ssRNAvirus on day 0.Mice were monitored and weighed daily and euthanized if weight loss Campbell et al.Page 4 Lupus .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 August 30.

Survival of C57Bl/6 control mice were previously reported to be 50% on day 8 after EMCVinjection.23 Immunohistochemistry For histological analyses, half kidneys were harvested and fixed in 10% formalin for ≥ 24 hours, transferred to 80% EtOH, and subsequently embedded in paraffin.Glomerular structure and inflammatory cells were determined on two 5μm sections 30μm apart after Hematoxylin/Eosin staining (Newcomer Supply, Middleton, WI) by a renal pathologist (J.K.N.).Immunofluorescence staining Half kidneys were frozen in OCT and 5μm sections were prepared and stained using Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and fluorescein isothyocyanate (FITC)–conjugated anti-mouse C3 specific antibodies (Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Portland, OR, USA).
Images were obtained using a 10x/0.3 Nikon Plan Fluor objective lens on a Keyence BZ-X710 Series fluorescence microscope. IgG deposition was quantified using Keyence BZ-X Viewer and Keyence BZ-X Analyzer software (Version 1.3.1.1, Keyence Corp., Osaka, Japan) and reported as arbitrary units representing average integrated brightness per glomerulus.Mean brightness of glomeruli per mouse were quantified by averaging integrated brightness of each glomerulus within a 10X field of view.Detection of GC B cells within spleens was done using FITC-conjugated anti-B220 antibodies, biotinylated anti-GL7 antibodies (EBiosciences), and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen) on 5μm frozen sections.Mean area of GCs per mouse were quantified by averaging area of each GC within 10X field of view using microscope software mentioned above.All images to be compared were obtained using identical microscope settings (gain and exposure time).
Statistical analyses Analyses were done in Graphpad Prism 9.1 using Brown-Forsythe and Welch’s one-way ANOV A with Dunnett’s T3’s adjustment for multiple comparisons. Two-way ANOV A test was performed on longitudinal data.Two-group comparisons as presented in Supplemental Figures 2 were evaluated using Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction.Results Sustained reduction of SigH+ pDCs after early DT-mediated ablation We have previously shown that ablation of SigH+ pDCs before 18 weeks of age leads to concomitant blockade of lupus-like disease development in B6.Nba2 mice.18 SLE pathogenesis, however, is chronic and thus investigating treatment efficacy in animals over longer time periods and in animals with established disease is important.We initiated three separate treatment strategies as outlined in Supplemental Figure 1.
Female mice were treated from 18 to 24 weeks of age (late group), 12–18 weeks of age and then followed until 24 weeks of age (followed group), or 12–14, 16–18, 20–22 weeks and then followed until 24 weeks of age (pulse group). Control mice were included for each setup and included DT-treated DTRtg-negative littermates.To determine treatment efficacy, levels of SigH + Campbell et al.Page 5 Lupus .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 August 30.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript pDCs were determined in spleen samples from all three groups at 24 weeks of age.Levels of SigH+ pDCs were significantly reduced in followed and pulse treated groups ( p < 0.01) (Figure 1).Mice treated with DT from 18 to 24 weeks (late group) showed no significant reduction in levels of SigH+ pDCs (Supplemental Figure 2A).
Additional analyses of IFN α levels and the expression of Irf7 and Ifi202 , two interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), also showed reduced levels in 24 week old pulse-treated DTRtg-positive versus DTRtg-negative animals, although these readouts did not reach statistical significance (data not shown). Intermittent SigH+ pDC ablation ensures long-term reduction in serum autoantibodies Serum autoantibody levels in B6.Nba2 mice were previously shown to be affected by SigH+ pDC ablation.18 Despite significantly reduced levels of SigH+ pDCs in both followed and pulse treated mice as shown above, only pulse-treated mice showed sustained reduction in serum autoantibodies and total immunoglobulin at 24 weeks of age (Figure 2(a)–(c)).
Serum total IgG levels were significantly reduced only at 18 weeks of age in the followed group ( p < 0.01 compared to DTRtg- group), confirming our previous findings.18 Mice treated from 18 to 24 weeks of age had serum autoantibody and total immunoglobulin levels similar to control mice (Supplemntal Figure 2B–D). Intermittent SigH+ pDC ablation reduces renal immune-complex deposition and damage B6.Nba2 mice do not develop renal failure but will present with mesangial proliferation, glomerulonephritis, IgG-immune complex deposition, and complement fixation.18,24 Kidneys were isolated at 24 weeks of age and analyzed for glomerular IgG-deposition, glomerulonephritis, and tubular infiltration.None of the groups of animals displayed enlarged glomeruli (Figure 3(A)–(b)); however, pulse-treated animals displayed reduced IgG deposition and complement factor C’3 fixation ( p < 0.01, Figure 3(c)–(d)) and an overall reduced renal score ( p = 0.07, Figure 3(e)).
In contrast, mice treated from 12 to 18 weeks and then followed until 24 weeks of age (followed group) did not display reduced renal phenotypes as compared to control mice (Figure 3). Mice treated from 18 to 24 weeks of age (late group) also showed no significant differences in renal inflammation, IgG deposition, and complement C’3 fixation, supporting an early role for pDCs in disease pathogenesis (Supplemental Figure 2E–H).Pulse-treated B6.Nba2.DTRtg+ mice display reduced frequencies of GC B cells and plasma cells Lupus-like disease in B6.Nba2 mice is characterized by splenomegaly.21,24,25 At 24 weeks of age, both followed and pulse-treated mice displayed smaller spleens (p = 0.07 and p = 0.08, respectively) (Figure 4(a)).Further analyses of the splenic immune cell composition showed no difference in the overall frequency of B cells (Figure 4(b)), but reduced frequencies of activated B cells in both cohorts of mice (Figure 4(c)).
Only pulse-treated animals displayed lower levels of GC B cells and plasma cells ( p < 0.01, p = 0.06, respectively) (Figure 4(d), (f)). There were no changes in frequencies of memory B cells (Figure 4(e)).Additional analyses of pulse-treated mice showed no difference in the area of splenic GCs (Figure 4(g)–(h)) and no change in the frequency of Tfh cells (Figure 4(i)).As expected, there were no differences between DTRtg+ and DTRtg- mice treated with DT from 18 to 24 weeks of age (late group)(-Supplemental Figure 2J–N).Campbell et al.Page 6 Lupus .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 August 30.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript T cell subsets and activation status were largely unaltered in SigH+ pDC-ablated animals We observed an increase in total CD4+ Tcells (Figure 5(a)), but no change in the frequency of activated CD40L+ CD4+ T cells (Figure 5(b)).
DTR+ mice treated and followed displayed an increase in the frequency of naïve CD4+ Tcells (Figure 5(c)), but there was no corresponding decrease in frequencies of effector/memory CD4+ Tcells (Figure 5(d)). Furthermore, there was no difference in the ratio of näıve to effector/memory CD4+ T cells between DTR- and DTR+ mice (Figure 5(e)).Finally, ablation of pDCs did not affect CD8+ T cell populations (Figure 5(f)).As expected there were also no changes in T cell populations in mice treated from 18 to 24 weeks of age (late group)(Supplemental Figure 2O–S).Frequencies of regulatory T cells (Foxp3+ CD4+ Tcells) were analyzed for the pulse-treated groups of animals and did not display any significant differences (1.11% of splenocytes (DTR-) versus 1.15% of splenocytes (DTR+, pulse); p = 0.8).
Ablation of SiglecH+ pDCs in (B6.Nba2 × NZW) F1.BDCA2-DTRtg mice also reduces disease parameters To explore if a similar effect of pDC ablation could be observed in a model developing renal failure, we treated a small cohort of DTRtg+ (n = 4) and DTRtg- (n = 3) (B6.Nba2 × NZW)F1 mice using a similar pulse-treatment strategy where mice were treated three times per week from 12–14, 16–18, and 20–22 weeks of age. Mice were analyzed at 24 weeks of age and analyzed for lupus disease parameters (Figure 6).Splenomegaly was reduced in DTRtg+ animals (Figure 6(a)).Despite no change in glomerulonephritis and glomerular size (Figure 6(b)–(c)), there was a strong trend towards reduced IgG-immune complex deposition in kidney glomeruli in DTRtg+ mice (Figure 6(d)–(e)).None of the mice developed proteinuria within this time frame (data not shown).
Anti-chromatin IgG and total IgG levels were reduced in DTRtg+ (B6.Nba2 × NZW)F1 mice (Figure 6(f)–(g)), which was supported by significantly lower levels of GC B cells (Figure 6(h)) and PCs (Figure 6(i)). Interestingly, we also observed lower levels of Tfh cells in DTRtg+ (B6.Nba2 × NZW)F1 mice, although the data did not reach statistical difference (Figure 6(j)).Ablation of SiglecH+ pDCs does not affect TD-dependent antibody responses and EMCV- induced antiviral responses In order to determine if SigH+ pDC ablation would affect antibody responses to a T- dependent antigen, DTRtg+ and DTRtg- mice were treated with DT during primary (day −1 to 28) or secondary immunization (day 149 to 164) with NP 27-CGG/CFA.No difference in the ability to mount a primary anti-NP IgG1 response (day 7–28) was observed (Figure 7(a)).After 5 months (day 150), mice were redistributed into new groups receiving either NP27-CGG or PBS.
The secondary anti-NP IgG1 response was measured on days 7 and 14 post-secondary immunization after which the animals were euthanized. No change was observed in anti-NP IgG1 levels during recall immunization (Figure 7(a), days 150–164).To determine if SigH+ pDCs were required for mounting an anti-viral response to an ssRNA virus, 12-week-old B6.Nba2.BDCA2-DTRtg mice were treated with DT starting one day prior to EMCV infection.Inoculation with 100pfu (i.p.) had no effect on the weight and survival of B6.Nba2 mice and was not affected by levels of SigH+ pDC, despite 50% of B6 mice succumbing to the infection by day 8 (Figure 7(b)–(c) and23).Hypothesizing Campbell et al.Page 7 Lupus .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 August 30.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript that the lack of mortality in B6.Nba2 mice was due to endogenous production of high levels of IFN-Is, we repeated the experiment increasing the viral titer to 2000pfu.
While inoculation with 2000pfu EMCV resulted in 12–18% reduced weight and 35–50% mortality among B6.Nba2 mice, ablation of SigH+ pDCs still had no effect on the survival of the mice (Figure 7(d)–(e)), suggesting that the immune response to the ssRNA virus EMCV is independent of SigH+ pDCs. Discussion Several cell types have been suggested to be responsible for the elevated levels of IFN-Is observed in many SLE patients, including pDCs, LDGs, neutrophils, and keratinocytes.26–30 We have previously shown that ablation of SigH+ pDCs before disease onset protects B6.Nba2 female mice from early lupus-like disease development.18 Moreover, IFN-I receptor expression is required for disease development in B6.Nba2 mice, especially by B cells,11,31 suggesting that IFN-Is produced by pDCs drive B cell activation and differentiation resulting in lupus-like disease in this model.
In the current study, we investigated whether SigH+ pDC ablation could be initiated after disease onset to better align with the time SLE patients are diagnosed, as well as the most efficient strategy for long-term treatment. We show that sustained SigH+ pDC ablation using a pulsed treatment strategy (2 weeks on, 2 weeks off) can keep disease progression under control long-term (12 weeks), resulting in the reduction of multiple disease characteristics including splenomegaly, GC B cell and plasma cell accumulation, and IgG-IC deposition and autoantibody production.This effect was seen in B6.Nba2 mice and a small cohort of (B6.Nba2 × NZW)F1 mice treated similarly.Thus, long-term depletion treatment for chronic diseases such as SLE may benefit from a pulse-treatment strategy to prevent anti-treatment responses and prolong efficiency.
The lack of effect of SigH+ pDC ablation in active disease suggests that this population of pDCs plays a role during Nba2 -driven lupus like disease initiation and early disease development, but not during disease progression and maintenance. Given the important role for IFN-Is in the B6.Nba2 mouse model, this effect is likely due to a reduced need for IFN- Is at later stages of the disease, although an effect of other pDC-derived cytokines cannot be overlooked.
Although the mechanism behind a loss of IFN-I production by pDCs remains unknown, it is interesting to note that pDCs from MRL/lpr mice also lose their ability to produce IFN α as the mice develop disease.32 Similarly, constitutive stimulation of pDCs has been shown drive maturation of pDCs into more classic DCs showing increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules, increased antigen presentation and T cell activation capability, and a concomitant loss of IFN α production.33–35 Alternatively, constitutive stimulation by TLR7/9 ligands may result in reduced IFN α-production ability due to exhaustion, similar to the TLR7/9-induced downregulation of BDCA-2 observed on human pDCs.36 Further studies are needed to determine why and when pDCs become obsolete in Nba2 -driven autoimmunity. Concerns have been raised regarding the ability of patients to respond to infections in response to pDC depleting therapeutics.We show here that immunity to ssRNA EMCV Campbell et al.Page 8 Lupus .

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript virus, and the antibody response to a T-dependent model antigen, remains intact after SigH+ pDC-ablation in the B6.Nba2 lupus model.While it is possible that responsiveness to other ssRNA viruses may be impacted by pDCablation, our data are in agreement with studies showing that individuals unable to respond to TLR7 and TLR9 stimulation do not present with increased susceptibility to virus.37–40 It is also possible that EMCV activates other RNA-recognition receptors, such as TLR8 or RIG-I on other cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, or B cells.26,41–44 Furthermore, the route of viral infection has been shown to determine the need for pDCs in mice,45 and it is therefore possible that the intraperitoneal injection utilized in this study did not target pDCs.
In summary, treatment strategies targeting IFN-I producing SigH+ pDCs are dependent on the timing of treatment initiation and frequency. As further clinical studies are performed, it will therefore be important to identify responses among patients with newly diagnosed versus established disease.Our data do not imply general immune dysfunction in response to some infections, as pDC-ablated animals were able to respond normally to both a TD- antigen immunization and ssRNA viral infection.It will be of interest to see if similar data will emerge from the ongoing TOPAZ-1 study.Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Acknowledgments We acknowledge support from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health under award R01 AI118774 (T.N.J) and 5 R01 AI13592236 (R.H.S), and from a LIFELINE award from the Lupus Foundation of America (T.N.J.).
