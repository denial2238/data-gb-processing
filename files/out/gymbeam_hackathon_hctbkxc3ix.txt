Chronic Creatine Supplementation Alters Depression-like Behavior in Rodents in a Sex-Dependent Manner Patricia J Allen1, Kristen E D’Anci1, Robin B Kanarek*,1and Perry F Renshaw2,3 1Department of Psychology, Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA;2Department of Psychiatry, The Brain Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA;3Department of Veteran Affairs VISN 19 MIRECC, Salt Lake City, UT, USA Impairments in bioenergetic function, cellular resiliency, and structural plasticity are associated with the pathogenesis of mood disorders.Preliminary evidence suggests that creatine, an ergogenic compound known to promote cell survival and influence the production and usage of energy in the brain, can improve mood in treatment-resistant patients.This study examined the effects of chronic creatine supplementation using the forced swim test (FST), an animal model selectively sensitive to antidepressants with clinical efficacy inhuman beings.
Thirty male (experiment 1) and 36 female (experiment 2) Sprague–Dawley rats were maintained on either chow aloneor chow blended with either 2% w/w creatine monohydrate or 4% w/w creatine monohydrate for 5 weeks before the FST. Openfield exploration and wire suspension tests were used to rule out general psychostimulant effects.Male rats maintained on 4%creatine displayed increased immobility in the FST as compared with controls with no differences by diet in the open field test, whereasfemale rats maintained on 4% creatine displayed decreased immobility in the FST and less anxiety in the open field test comparedwith controls.Open field and wire suspension tests confirmed that creatine supplementation did not produce differences inphysical ability or motor function.The present findings suggest that creatine supplementation alters depression-like behavior in the FSTin a sex-dependent manner in rodents, with female rats displaying an antidepressant-like response.
Although the mechanisms of actionare unclear, sex differences in creatine metabolism and the hormonal milieu are likely involved.

In addition, evidence indicates that brain bioenergetics and cell survival pathways are necessary therapeutic targets for long-termclinical relief and symptom remission (Burroughs and French, 2007; Duman et al , 1999; Manji et al , 2000; Moretti et al , 2003). Taken together, a novel therapeutic strategy is to evaluate the effects on mood of agents that alter energyparameters and promote neuronal survival.In support of this supposition, two open-labeled studies found that creatine, a naturally occurring ergogenic compound, cansignificantly improve depressive mood (Amital et al , 2006; Roitman et al , 2007).Creatine ( N-aminoiminomethyl-N-methylglycine ) is acq- uired from high-protein foods or produced endogenously from the biosynthesis of arginine, glycine, or methionine inthe liver, kidney, pancreas, and possibly the brain (Andres et al , 2008).
The creatine–phosphocreatine (PCr) system serves as a spatial and temporal energy buffer in tissues withsignificant and fluctuating energy requirements, includingthe brain (Brosnan and Brosnan, 2007, McLeish and Kenyon, 2005; Walliman et al , 1992). Pools of cellular energy (ATP) are generated from the reaction PCr + ADP-Creatine + ATP and, conversely, energy is stored in the form of PCr: Creatine + ATP -PCr + ADP (Niklasson and Agren, 1984; Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk, 2000).Creatine kinase (CK) isoenzymes, the catalysts of these reactions, are located in tissue in which energy is greatly needed, making this enzyme system a critical regulator ofenergy homeostasis (Kuzhikandathil and Molloy, 1994, Walliman et al , 1992; Wilken et al , 1996).Creatine may modify depressive behavior because of its pivotal function in buffering metabolic processes to preventenergy exhaustion and neuronal death.
Creatine supple- mentation has been investigated in neurodegenerative and neurological diseases linked with mitochondrial dysfunc-tion, such as Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease, Received 14 May 2009; revised 15 August 2009; accepted 31 August 2009*Correspondence: Dr RB Kanarek, Department of Psychology, Tufts University, 490 Boston Avenue, Medford, MA 02155, USA, Tel: + 1617 627 5902, Fax: + 1 617 627 3181, E-mail: robin.kanarek@tufts.eduNeuropsychopharmacology (2010) 35, 534–546 &2010 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved 0893-133X/10 $32.00 www.neuropsychopharmacology.org and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (see Andres et al , 2008 for review), and may be of particular relevancefor psychiatric disorders in light of evidence that mitochondrial brain abnormalities occur in depressed subjects (Rezin et al , 2008; Shao et al , 2008; Stine et al , 1993).
Findings from rodent research indicate thatcreatine exerts neuroprotective effects by buffering ATP levels against neurotoxic assaults from 3-NP, MPTP, malonate, and harmful levels of glutamate (Brustovetskyet al , 2001; Matthews et al , 1998, 1999; Roy et al , 2002). Moreover, creatine promotes neuronal growth and survival.For instance, in vitro culture studies show that supplementation enhances dopaminergic cell survival (Andres et al , 2005) and promotes differentiation of GABA-ergic neuronal precursors, potently increasing cellsoma size and number of primary neurites per neuron(Ducray et al , 2007).Converging evidence indicates that alterations in high-energy phosphate metabolism, particularly creatineand PCr levels, are associated with depression (Agren and Niklasson, 1988; Cze ´het al , 2001; Iosifescu et al , 2008; Moore et al , 1997; Niklasson and Agren, 1984; Rezin et al , 2008; Volz et al , 1998).
Phosphorus-magnetic resonance spectroscopy has shown increased PCr and decreased ATP in the frontal lobe and basal ganglia of depressedsubjects in vivo (Kato et al , 1992; Kato and Takahashi, 1994; Moore et al , 1997; Volz et al , 1998). In addition, CK activity and levels of brain creatine are inversely related to theseverity of a depressive episode (Dager et al , 2004; Segal et al , 2007).Preliminary findings suggest that creatine supplementa- tion improves mood in human beings (Amital et al , 2006; Roitman et al , 2007).Men and women with treatment- resistant depression (Roitman et al , 2007) or PTSD with and without comorbid depression (Amital et al , 2006) supple- mented with creatine monohydrate for 4 weeks reported elevated mood on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Hamilton, 1960).This evidence is encouraging, but thesestudies are methodologically limited and confounded by sex, comorbidity, concurrent drug treatment, age, and severity of depression.
Gender comparisons have not beenreported in these studies because of small sample sizes, butthe function and expression of CK is sexually dimorphic (Gledhill et al , 1988; Meltzer, 1971; Ramirez and Jimenez, 2002; Wong et al , 1983). Moreover, altered purine levels in depressed women, but not men, have been associated with treatment response (Renshaw et al , 2001), suggesting that creatine may be more beneficial for treating depressedfemales.To resolve these issues, the objective of the present investigation was to determine the effects of long-termcreatine supplementation on male (experiment 1) andfemale (experiment 2) treatment naive rats using the forced swim test (FST), a rodent behavioral assay that is selectively sensitive to antidepressants, which have clinical efficacy inhuman beings (Detke et al , 1995; Porsolt, 1978; Porsolt et al , 1977, 1978).
Insight into the mechanisms associated with chronic creatine supplementation can be gained from themodified protocol of the FST, which distinguishes seroto- nergic and noradrenergic activity from selective increases swimming or climbing behavior, respectively (Detke et al , 1995).MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and Housing In experiment 1, 30 male Sprague–Dawley rats (175–200 g), approximately 6 weeks old, were obtained from CharlesRiver Laboratories (Raleigh, NC). Rats were housed individually in hanging stainless-steel cages in a climate- controlled vivarium (22 ±11C) on a 12 : 12 h reverse light- dark cycle (lights on at 1900 h).Animals were given 7 days to acclimate to handling and housing conditions before the beginning of the study.All experimental manipulationswere conducted under red lights during the dark portion ofthe cycle, except as noted.In experiment 2, 36 female Sprague–Dawley rats (155–175 g), approximately 6 weeks old, were obtainedfrom Charles River Laboratory.
Housing conditions, diet, and behavioral procedures were maintained exactly as in experiment 1. Vaginal smears were not obtained to ensurethat females were not exposed to additional stressors not experienced by males.All testing occurred between 1000 and 1800 h, and animals were tested in random order.All procedures wereapproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Tufts University.Diets Animals were fed either chow alone or chow blended with2% w/w creatine monohydrate or 4% w/w creatine monohydrate for 5 weeks before behavioral testing ( n¼10 males per group; n¼12 females per group).The creatine- supplemented mixtures were made in-house using creatine monohydrate X98% (Sigma Chemical; 0 kcal/g) and ground Purina chow #5001 (3.4 kcal/g).The diets were mixed thoroughly each morning before the animals’ food cups were refilled.
Food was presented in Wahmann LC306(Timonium, MD) stainless-steel food cups, which werecovered with lids and clipped to the floor of the cage to protect against spillage. Glass water bottles with drip-proof stoppers were fitted at the front of each cage.All rats wereweight matched at the beginning of the experiment.Body weight, food and water intakes were measured daily at the same time of day.Food intake was recorded to the nearest0.1 g and reported in calories (to the nearest 0.1 kcal).Water intake and body weights were recorded to the nearest 1.0 g.Creatine intake was calculated by multiplying the amount offood consumed by the percentage of creatine added to the diet.The amount of creatine consumed was reported in grams per kilogram (g/kg).Behavioral Testing All behavioral measures were performed between 5 and 6weeks after initial creatine supplementation.
All procedureswere conducted by the same experimenters under red lights,with the exception that the open field test was conducted under indirect dim white light (60 W). All behavioral tests were set to start at the same time of day for all procedures(1000 h), and all animals were tested in random order.All behavioral measures were video recorded for later scoring by two observers blind to dietary conditions (inter-raterreliability correlation 40.90 for all tests).Creatine intake alters depressive behavior PJ Allen et al 535 Neuropsychopharmacology Forced Swim Test The FST was conducted over 2 days and consisted of a pre- test and test trial, referred to as trial 1 and trial 2.During the first trial, each rat was placed in a clear Plexiglas cylinder(25 cm in diameter by 65 cm in height) filled to 48 cm with 251C water for 15 min.
Twenty-four hours after initial testing, each rat was placed in the same apparatus for 5 min.Each rat was tested in a clean container with fresh water,dried thoroughly on trial completion, and placed back in its home cage. The container was drained and cleaned after each use.The time-sampling technique developed by Detke et al (1995) was used to score the first 5 min of behavior during trial 1 and the 5 min of behavior during trial 2.At the end ofeach 5-s period of time, two raters naive to diet conditions scored the predominant behavior of the rat (for a total of 60 intervals per trial).
Four behaviors were rated: (1)immobility Fdefined as making only those movements necessary to stay afloat, (2) swimming Fjudged as active motions that propel the animal around the cylinder ormotions that were more active than what is required to onlystay afloat, (3) climbing Fdefined as vigorous movement of the forepaws that is directed against the wall, (4) divingFdefined as when the animal submerges its whole body and directs its head in a downward motion. As diving occurred rarely in experiment 1 and experiment 2, and because diving has been earlier shown to be an unreliablemeasure of antidepressant-like activity (Detke et al , 1995), diving counts are not reported.Latency to the onset of immobility was operationally defined as at least twoconsecutive 5-s intervals (at least 10 s) of immobility.Latency to immobility is indicative of the individuals’ sensitivity to an uncontrollable stressor (Carlezon et al , 2003; Leussis and Andersen, 2008).
Specifically, decreasedlatency to immobility indicates that the animal is more prone to depression-like behavior and the negative effects of forced swim stress, whereas increased latency indicates theopposite. Body Temperature Brain-type CK (BB-CK) activity regulates body temperaturerhythm and thermoregulation in rodents (Streijger et al , 2009).Depletion of dietary creatine alters brown adiposetissue thermogenic activity (Yamashita et al , 1995), but the effects of excess dietary creatine on body temperature are unknown.To ensure that creatine supplementation doesnot alter behavioral response in the FST, a digital rectal thermometer (Yellow Springs Instruments, Model 49TA) was used to record internal body temperatures before andafter each swim trial.Wire Suspension Animals were allowed to rest after the FST for 2 days before psychomotor testing.The wire suspension test was used to rule out any potential confounds arising from differences inphysical ability or motor function.
The wire suspension task measured muscle strength and prehensile reflex, meaning the ability of the animal to grasp a taut horizontal wire(2 mm in diameter, 62 cm above the table top) with itsforepaws and to remain suspended. Latency to drop from the wire was measured in seconds, with a maximum latencyof 60 s.Open Field Exploration The open field test was designed to measure anxiety as wellas behavioral responses such as locomotor activity andexploratory behaviors.One week after the FST, rats were placed in a square apparatus (50 cm length /C250 cm width) divided into 5 cm 2in a grid-like manner.The center of the field was illuminated by a 60-W bulb, which was the only direct source of light in the testing room.Each animal was placed in a randomized starting corner within the field andits behavior was recorded for 5 min.Scored behaviors included the number of rears, stretch attends, grooming, and the number of times the animal returned to its startingcorner.
Also recorded were latency to leave the home corner, time spent in all corners, time spent in the borders, and time spent in the center of the field. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS v.15.0 for Windows XP.Body weight, calories, creatine, and water intake wereanalyzed using repeated measures (mixed model) ANOVA,with diet group as the between-subjects factor and day as the within-subjects factor.In addition, weekly averages of daily body weight, calorie and creatine consumption, andwater intake were analyzed using one-way ANOVA.Forced swim behavior and body temperature were analyzed using separate repeated measures (mixed model)ANOVA, with diet as the between-subjects factor and trial as the within-subjects variable.Separate one-way ANOVAs were also performed for each trial of forced swim behaviorwhen significant effects were detected (ie, latency toimmobility, total immobility, swimming, climbing).
Open field and wire suspension performance were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Planned post hoc comparisons were made using least-significant differences tests.Significance was defined as a p-value of o0.05.RESULTS Experiment 1: Effect of Creatine on FST Responsivity and Locomotor Performance in Males Diets and body weight.Average creatine intake (g/kg) significantly decreased over 6 weeks of supplementation ( + 2% creatine: F(5,45) ¼42.78, po0.0001; + 4% creatine: F(5,45) 23.71, po0.0001).During the first week of supplementation, males fed + 2% creatine consumed an average ( ±SEM) of 1.90 ±0.02 g/kg daily, and males fed + 4% creatine consumed an average of 4.17 ±0.10 g/kg daily.The mean decline in creatine consumption over the courseof 6 weeks for the + 2 and + 4% diets were 0.70 ±0.2 and 1.53±0.05 g/kg, respectively.There were no significant diet by day interactions for body weight, calories, or water intake over 6 weeks of creatine supplementation (Figure 1a–c, respectively).
Analyses of average daily water consumption by weekshowed a significant main effect of diet duringCreatine intake alters depressive behavior PJ Allen et al 536 Neuropsychopharmacology week 1 (F(2,27) ¼8.332, p¼0.002) and during week 2 (F(2,27) ¼4.5999, p¼0.019). Post hoc tests indicated that rats given + 4% creatine drank significantly more water than rats in all other groups (Figure 1c), but this effect was no longer significant by the third week.There were nosignificant differences for the remainder of the study orduring behavioral testing days.Forced swim test.Trial :Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted on all three diet groups together to determine the changes across time and between diet groups.Overall, there was a significant increase in total immobility over the two testingsessions (F(1,27) ¼33.30, po0.001).
Analysis of each diet group separately using paired t-tests indicated that the all groups significantly increased total counts of immobility (0%: t(9)¼/C02.27, p¼0.049; 2%: t(9)¼/C03.57, p¼0.006; 4%: t(9)¼/C04.81, p¼0.001). There was also a significant decrease in latency to the onset of immobility over the two testing sessions (F(1,27) ¼17.16, po0.001).Analysis of each diet group separately indicated that the + 2% diet (t(9)¼3.27, p¼0.01) and the + 4% diet (4%: t(9)¼2.47, p¼0.035) significantly decreased latency to immobility.The + 0% group decreased latency to immobility, but thisgroup did not reach statistical significance.Climbing counts significantly decreased over the two testing sessions (F(1,27) ¼34.02, po0.001).Analysis of each diet group separately indicated that all groups significantly reduced climbing behavior ( + 0%: t(9)¼4.16, p¼0.002; + 2%: t(9)¼3.49, p¼0.007; + 4%: t(9)¼2.90, p¼0.018.There were no significant changes in swimming behavior over time.
Diet:Latency to the onset of immobility differed significantly as a function of diet collapsed across trials(F(2,27) ¼11.90, po0.001). Post hoc analysis indicated that rats supplemented with + 4% creatine more rapidly displayed immobility in the FST than rats given + 0% creatine ( po0.001) or + 2% creatine ( po0.001; Figure 2a).Mean counts of total immobility differed significantly as a function of diet collapsed across trials (F(2,27) ¼4.392, po0.05).Post hoc analyses indicated that rats supplemented with + 4% creatine spent significantly more time immobile than rats fed + 0% creatine ( p¼0.011) or + 2% creatine (p¼0.027; Figure 2b and c).There was no significant diet by trial interaction for latency to onset of immobility or mean counts of immobility.Mean swimming counts differed significantly as a function of diet collapsed across trials (F(2,27) ¼9.841, po0.001), but there was not a significant diet by trial interaction.
Post hoc testing indicated that the + 4% creatine group swam significantly less than the + 0%creatine controls ( po0.001) and the + 2% creatine group (po0.001; Figure 2b and c). Mean climbing counts did not differ as a function of diet or diet over two trials (Figure 2band c).When data were analyzed separately for each FST trial, latency to immobility differed significantly as a function ofdiet during both trial 1 (F(2,27) ¼7.77, p¼0.002) and trial 2 (F(2,27) ¼8.579, p¼0.001).Post hoc analyses indicated that rats supplemented with + 4% creatine more rapidlydisplayed immobility during trial 1 and trial 2 than ratsgiven + 0% creatine (trial 1: p¼0.003; trial 2: po0.0001) or + 2% creatine (trial 1: p¼0.001, trial 2: p¼0.037).Immobility counts differed significantly during trial 2 only(F(2,27) ¼4.35, p¼0.023).Post hoc analyses indicated that males fed + 4% creatine spent more time immobile than males fed + 0% creatine ( p¼0.009) or + 2% creatine ( p¼0.035).
Swimming counts differed significantly during Figure 1 Mean (±SEM) body weight, caloric intake, and water consumption of males did not vary as a function of creatine supplementa-tion over 6 weeks (a–c). Separate one-way ANOVAs for weekly averagesof daily water consumption indicate that rats given + 4% creatine drankmore water during week 1 (** po0.001 vs+ 0%, ** po0.008 vs+ 2%) and week 2 (** po0.007 vs+ 0%, * po0.041 vs+ 2%), but this effect was no longer significant by the third week.There were no significant differencesfor the remainder of the study or during behavioral testing days.Creatine intake alters depressive behavior PJ Allen et al 537 Neuropsychopharmacology trial 1 (F(2,27) ¼5.44, p¼0.01) and trial 2 (F(2,27) ¼8.65, p¼0.001).
Post hoc analyses indicated that animals given + 4% creatine swam significantly less compared with animals given + 0% creatine during trial 1 and trial 2(T1: p¼0.011, T2: po0.0001) and swam significantly less than males fed + 2% creatine during T1 ( p¼0.006). Climbing counts did not differ during trial 1 or trial 2.Body temperature.Body temperature declined significantly after exposure to each trial of the FST (trial 1: F(1,27) ¼176.11, po0.0001); trial 2: F(1,27) ¼760.40, po0.0001), but this hypothermic effect did not vary as a function of diet ( p40.05).The average change in body temperature ( ±SEM) after exposure to trial 1 (15 min) for males fed + 0%, + 2%, or + 4% was 3.89 ±0.67, 5.66 ±0.34, and 4.70±0.771C, respectively.The average change in body temperature after exposure to trial 2 (5 min) for males fed + 0%, + 2%, or + 4% creatine was 3.84 ±0.25, 3.61 ±0.25, and 3.47±.191C, respectively.Wire suspension.
Total wire suspension time did not differ significantly as a function of diet (Figure 3a). Open field exploration.Open field activity did not vary as a function of diet (all p40.05; Figure 3b and c).There were no significant differences in time to leave the homecorner, time spent in all corners, time spent in the borders,or time spent in the center.There were no significant differences in behavioral counts, specifically the number of rears, stretch attends, episodes of grooming, or returns tohome corner.Experiment 2: Effect of Creatine on FST Responsivity and Locomotor Performance in Females Unequal n.After the FST, one female animal in the 2% creatine condition died because of causes unrelated to the test procedure.Behavioral data reflect this unequal n.Diets and body weights.Average creatine intake (g/kg) significantly decreased over 6 weeks of supplementation( + 2%: F(5,50) ¼33.09, po0.0001; + 4%: F(5,50) ¼49.60, po0.0001).
During the first week of supplementation, females fed + 2% creatine consumed an average ( ±SEM) of 1.89±0.03 g/kg daily, and females fed + 4% creatine consumed an average of 3.77 ±0.08 g/kg daily. The mean decline in creatine consumption over the course of 6 weeksfor the + 2 and + 4% diets were 0.35 ±0.04 and 0.70±0.07 g/kg, respectively.There was no significant diet by day interactions for body weight, calories, or water intake over 6 weeks of creatine supplementation (Figure 4a–c, respectively).Forced swim test.Trial :Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted on all three diet groups together to determine the changes across time and between diet groups.Overall, there was a significant increase in total immobility over the two testingsessions (F(1,33) ¼44.62, po0.001).
Analysis of each diet group separately using paired t-tests indicated that the all groups significantly increased total counts of immobility(0%: t(11)¼/C04.41, p¼0.008; 2%: t(11)¼/C03.44, p¼0.005; 4%: t(11)¼/C03.83, p¼0.003). There was also a significant decrease in latency to the onset of immobility over the twotesting sessions (F(1,33) ¼50.82, po0.001).Analysis of each Figure 2 Mean (±SEM) latency to immobility (a), immobility counts (b, c), swim counts (b, c), and climbing counts (b, c) of males as a functionof creatine supplementation.Note that significance values displayed ongraphs are derived from separate one-way ANOVAs for each FST trialcompared with + 0% controls.Repeated measures analyses indicate that(a, top panel) + 4% creatine group more rapidly displayed immobilityacross trials (** po0.001, + 4% vs+ 0%; ** po0.001, + 4% vs+ 2%).

Data are presented as latencies to become immobile in seconds (a), or total counts of immobility, swimming, or climbing (b, c).Creatine intake alters depressive behavior PJ Allen et al 538 Neuropsychopharmacology diet group separately indicated that all groups significantly decreased latency to immobility (0%: t(11)¼3.23, p¼0.008; 2%: t(11)¼4.30, p¼0.001; 4%: t(11)¼5.06, po0.001).There was no overall difference in swimming counts acrosstwo trials.Analysis of each diet group separately indicated that females fed the + 0% diet significantly decreased swimming activity over time ( t(11)¼2.84, p¼0.016), but there were no changes in swimming behavior by the + 2 and + 4% groups.
There was a significant decrease in climbing behavior over the two testing sessions (F(1,33) ¼29.33, po0.0001). Analysis of each diet separately indicated thatall groups significantly reduced climbing activity in the second trial (0%: t(11)¼2.65, p¼0.023; 2%: t(11)¼3.28, p¼0.007; 4%: t(11)¼3.41, p¼0.006).Diet:Latency to immobility differed significantly as a function of dietary condition collapsed across trials(F(2,33) ¼5.956, p¼0.006).Post hoc analyses indicated Figure 3 Mean (±SEM) wire suspension (a) and open field (b, c) performance of males as a function of creatine supplementation.Locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, and muscle strength did not vary bydiet.Data for time in center and latency to enter center are represented by a subset of the total number of rats ( + 0%: n¼9; + 2%: n¼8; + 4% n¼9).Figure 4 Mean (±SEM) body weight, caloric intake, and water consumption of females did not vary as a function of creatinesupplementation over 6 weeks (a–c).
Separate one-way ANOVAs indicatethat there were no differences in body weight (a), caloric intake (b), orwater consumption (c) per week.Creatine intake alters depressive behavior PJ Allen et al 539 Neuropsychopharmacology that the + 0% creatine controls more rapidly displayed immobility in the FST than rats in the + 4% creatinecondition ( po0.001; Figure 5a). Mean counts of total immobility differed significantly as a function of dietary condition collapsed across trials (F(2,33) ¼3.328, p¼0.048).Post hoc analyses indicated that rats supplemen- ted with + 4% creatine spent significantly less time immobile than the + 0% creatine controls ( p¼0.021), but did not differ significantly from rats given + 2% creatine(p¼0.654; Figure 5b and c).There was no significant diet by trial interaction for latency to onset of immobility or mean counts of immobility.
Mean swimming counts did not differ as a function of diet across trials, but there was a significant diet by trial interaction (F(2,33) ¼4.28, p¼0.022). Post hoc analysis indicates that the + 0% creatine controls reduced totalswimming activity over time, whereas rats given + 2 and + 4% creatine showed similar counts during both trials (Figure 5b and c).Mean climbing counts did not differ as afunction of diet or diet by trial interaction.When data were analyzed separately for each FST trial by diet, latency to immobility differed significantly as afunction of diet during both trial 1 (F(2,33) ¼6.07, p¼0.006) and trial 2 (F(2,33) ¼3.28, p¼0.049).Post hoc analyses indicated that females fed + 4% creatine lessrapidly displayed immobility compared with females fed + 0% creatine (trial 1: p¼0.001; trial 2: p¼0.019).Swimming counts differed significantly during trial 2 only(F(2,33 ¼3.42, p¼0.045).

Male rats given + 4% creatine more rapidly displayed immobility andspent significantly more time immobile than rats in the + 0 or + 2% creatine conditions, suggesting that males fed + 4% creatine are more vulnerable to the negative effects of forced swim stress and are prone to depression-like behavior. In comparison, female rats supplemented with + 4% creatine displayed immobility less rapidly and spent significantly less time immobile compared with the + 0% creatine condition, suggesting that + 4% creatine attenuates the negative effects of forced swim stress and exertsantidepressant-like effects in female rats.Of note is the behavioral specificity of these findings.Muscle strength, locomotion, and body temperature did not differ as afunction of diet in both males and females.In addition, females supplemented with + 4% creatine displayed modest reductions in anxiety compared with rats given + 0 and + 2%creatine without altering locomotor activity.
A complementary pattern of findings from swimming and climbing counts indicate that dietary creatine is associated with serotonergic activity in males and females in oppositedirections. Detke et al 1995 have shown that serotonergic antidepressants selectively increase swimming behavior, whereas noradrenergic antidepressants selectively increaseclimbing behavior.Moreover, antagonists of the serotoner- gic system prevent both the reduction of immobility and increase in swimming behavior usually observed in ratsadministered specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; Page et al , 1999; Wang et al , 2008).In the present studies, males fed + 4% creatine showed significantly reducedswimming activity with no changes in climbing activitycompared with controls.Females fed + 2 and + 4% creatine maintained higher swimming activity over two trials compared with females fed + 0% creatine with nodifferences in climbing activity.
Ongoing studies are examining the relationship between creatine and seroto- nergic agents, specifically to evaluate the usefulness ofcreatine as an adjuvant to SSRI drug therapy. Importantly, male and female animals supplemented with + 4% creatine displayed differential responsivity to forced swim stress during the initial trial of the procedure.These findings contrast with the original purpose of trial 1 of the FST as described by Porsolt et al , 1977, which was to induce ‘behavioral despair,’ a phenomenon characterized byreduced latency for rats to become immobile and increased total immobility during the second trial.Antidepressant agents are typically administered after the pre-test trial andbefore the test trial, resulting in an anti-immobility effect at certain doses.Accordingly, the first trial of the FST procedure is not often quantified or reported because theexperimental manipulation takes place after the induction of a state change in the animal.
The present experimental design was different in that the rats were administeredcreatine daily for 5 weeks before the initial FST, the averageduration of treatment before clinical effects are observed in human beings. The finding that chronic creatine supple- mentation altered behavior in the first trial is consistentwith earlier research that has found that chronic anti- depressant treatment can induce significant changes in forced swimming behavior during the first trial (Armarioet al , 1988; Lahmame et al , 1996; Overstreet et al , 2004).It is important to note that there were no statistical comparisons between males and females because each sexwas studied at different times.Moreover, to be consistent Figure 6 Mean (±SEM) wire suspension (a) and open field (b, c) performance of females as a function of creatine supplementation.One-way ANOVAs indicate that (c, bottom panel) anxiety-like behavior variedby diet.
Females fed + 4% creatine spent significantly less time in thecorners compared with controls (* p¼0.016, + 4 vs+ 0%) and significantly more time in the borders compared with animals fed + 0 or + 2% creatine(*p¼0.022, + 4 vs+ 0%; * p¼0.044, + 4 vs+ 2%), suggesting + 4% creatine had a modest anxiolytic-like effect in females. Locomotion and muscle strength did not vary by diet (a–c).Data for time in center andlatency to enter center are represented by a subset of the total number ofrats ( + 0%: n¼5; + 2%: n¼6; + 4% n¼5).Creatine intake alters depressive behavior PJ Allen et al 541 Neuropsychopharmacology with earlier research, male and female diets were enhanced with equivalent percentages of creatine ( + 2 and + 4%w/w), but this translated into significantly different dosages of creatine per kilogram of body weight given that males eat larger quantities of chow and gain substantially more weightover a 6-week period of time.
The fact that males andfemales received different absolute doses that declined over the course of the study could have had an effect on behavior. It is critical to know whether rodent behaviorvaries at different doses or whether there is a threshold dose after which the effects begin to occur.The present observation that male rats fed + 4% creatine are more prone to depression-like behavior is consistent with evidence that suggests that creatine supplementation alters brain chemistry in a manner that may be conducive todepressive behavior.Unmedicated depressed male andfemale patients have increased absolute concentrations of total creatine (creatine and PCr) in the left and right frontal lobe (Frey et al , 2003).Further, Lyoo et al 2003 reported that oral creatine supplementation in human beings significantly increased creatine and PCr reserves, whereas it decreased beta gamma-nucleotide triphosphate ( g-NTP) levels, which reflect lowered ATP levels.
Reduced total ATP and lowered CK activity are characteristic of depression (Moore et al , 1997; Volz et al , 1998). High levels of creatine supplementation may cause the brain to make compensa- tory changes to accommodate increases in the high-energy phosphate pool.Specifically, it is hypothesized that a shiftin the CK equilibrium reaction down-regulates the synthesisof ATP in response to increased PCr to maintain energy homeostasis (Iosifescu et al , 2008; Lyoo et al , 2003).The present finding has important clinical implications.Speci-fically, high baseline levels of PCr and low levels of ATP may be unique to depressed patients who respond more favorably to antidepressant treatment (Iosfescu et al , 2008).
Supplementation with creatine can induce equivalent changes in brain energetic parameters in healthy adults (Lyoo et al , 2003), suggesting the possibility that creatine supplementation can modify brain high-energy phosphate metabolism to improve treatment response in patients with depression. Moreover, the effectiveness of antidepressantdrugs may be related to their actions on phosphorylatingenzymes such as CK (Moretti et al , 2003).Altogether, although creatine may be pro-depressant in male rats as a dietary supplement alone, it may sensitize the brain toantidepressant treatment, thereby increasing therapeutic efficacy.In contrast to the results for males, the highest dose of creatine ( + 4%) produced antidepressant-like effects in female rats.This result is consistent with findings that performance in animal models of depression and responsesto antidepressant treatment are sex dependent (Brotto et al , 2000; Drossopoulou et al , 2004; Lifschytz et al , 2006).
However, sex comparisons have not been made between male and female depressed patients in human clinical trialsevaluating the antidepressant effect of creatine supplemen- tation because of the small sample sizes (Amital et al , 2006; Roitman et al , 2007). As such, the mechanisms underlying the sex-specific effects of creatine supplementation in rats have yet to be elucidated, but may involve sex differences in general metabolic processes, the hormonal milieu, or thestress response.The differential response to creatinesupplementation may be explained by sexually dimorphic patterns of CK expression, levels of CK activity, totalcreatine concentrations, or creatine transport into the brain (Gledhill et al , 1988; Hamakawa et al , 1999; Meltzer, 1971; Ramirez and Jimenez, 2002; Wong et al , 1983).The BB-CK is a favored marker of estrogenic action (Reiss and Kaye,1981).
In females, estrogen rapidly up-regulates the synth- esis of BB-CK in regions densely populated by estrogen receptors, such as the preoptic area, anterior hypothalamus,and median eminence (Malnick et al , 1983). Ramirez and Jimenez, 2002 observed that only female rats displayed cyclical increases and decreases in cerebral CK activity,which may reflect cyclical changes in the estrous cycle.Further, it was reported that female rats express a larger number and variance of cytosolic CK in the cerebrum andcerebellum, which increases the efficiency of ATP replen-ishment, through the creatine–PCr system, to meet sudden energy needs.One potential implication is that estrogen or its receptors modulate the therapeutic effect of creatineobserved in female rats through the sexually dimorphic expression and function of CK.
Estrogen is a plausible consideration, as there is a number of clinical and experimental evidence that estrogenic metabolites mediate depressive behavior (Carranza-Liraand Valentino-Figueroa, 1999; Cohen et al , 2003; Estrada- Camarena et al , 2003; Halbreich and Kahn, 2001; Rodriguez- Landa et al , 2007; Walf et al , 2004). An important question is whether creatine can exert antidepressant effects in theabsence of estrogen.It is hypothesized that estrogen has aprotective function in the brain by enhancing energy metabolism and usage through direct stimulation of protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation in the mitochondria ofneurons (for review, see Chen et al , 2005; Klinge, 2008; Vasudevan and Pfaff, 2008).
If the antidepressant-like effects of creatine depend on the presence of estrogen, theestrogen receptor ER bisoform may be involved because it is localized within mitochondria of neurons (Yang et al , 2004), and it is known to have a distinct function in mediatingdepressive behavior (Walf and Frye, 2006; Walf et al , 2009, 2004; Rocha et al , 2005). Taken together, it may be possible that the sex-specific differences by diet observed in the FSTare a consequence of estrogenic influences on CK activity,but this question cannot be answered with the present findings.This is an important avenue for future research as depression occurs twice as frequently in women than inmen, a finding that is consistent across history and cultures (Bebbington et al , 2003; Kessler, 2003).Moreover, depressed women are more severely impaired, experience longerepisodes, and relapse more frequently than depressed men (Kornstein et al , 2000; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1987).
Ongoing research is planned to evaluate the relationship between sexhormones and alterations in depression-like behavior inresponse to creatine supplementation. Future research should extend the present findings to clarify the effects of both exogenous and endogenouscreatine on the central nervous system.An important consideration in the interpretation of the present results is the choice of animal model.The key rationale of the presentresearch was based on human clinical trials, which found that creatine had mood-elevating effects in depressed patients resistant to antidepressant therapies (Roitmanet al , 2007) and patients with comorbid PTSD andCreatine intake alters depressive behavior PJ Allen et al 542 Neuropsychopharmacology depression (Amital et al , 2006).The FST was chosen to evaluate animal behavior because it shows superiorconstruct and predictive validities among models that detect antidepressant-like effects (Dalvi and Lucki, 1999).
As such, it would be the best model to answer the presentresearch question of whether creatine can exert antidepres-sant-like effects in rodents. However, the ‘mood state’ of the animal during the time of treatment and testing may alter the behavioral outcomes.A concern in animal literature isthe use of antidepressant models that subject otherwise healthy animals to acute stress.Stress has been studied extensively as a precipitating factor in the onset ofdepression (Caspi et al , 2003; Duman and Monteggia, 2006; Pittenger and Duman, 2008; Sapolsky, 2000), and the effects of a given treatment may vary greatly depending onwhether the subject has a ‘healthy’ vs‘depressed’ brain, the latter of which is metabolically impaired.The possibility remains that metabolic impairments resulting from chronic stress could alter the effects of creatine on behavioralresponsivity in the FST.
Accordingly, use of an animal model of depression, such as the unpredictable chronic mild stress paradigm (Willner et al , 1987; Willner, 1997), would further clarify the effects of creatine on depression-like behavior in rats. Dosages and time course are two more notable con- siderations for behavioral studies.Ample research has established that dietary creatine, in daily doses ranging from + 0.25% w/w to + 7% w/w, is safe and well tolerated inrodents (Horn et al , 1998).However, the majority of animal research has failed to include more than one dose of creatine, with the majority using + 2% w/w or less (Pen ˜a- Altamira et al , 2005; Rooney et al , 2002; Roy et al , 2002; Sullivan et al , 2000).There is need to evaluate the dose- response curve for creatine using a more reliable method of administration, such as the use of gavage (aswith Ozkan et al , 2005) or intracerebroventricular injection (as used by Koga et al , 2005).
In addition, rats in the + 4% creatine group consumed approximately 2–4 g/kgdaily, an amount that is at least 5 to 10 times the highest dose usually taken by human beings. For instance, clinical trials in human beings with a number of neurologicalconditions, such as GAMT deficiency or mitochondrialmyopathy, treated patients with 0.13–0.8 g/kg daily (for review, see Andres et al , 2008).In addition, housing and handling procedures may have influenced behavior in the present studies.Animals were handled extensively before behavioral testing and housed singly.The majority of FST studies house animals in groups,allowing for social interaction.
This study housed rats in isolation, which has been shown to increase immobility in the FST (Grippo et al , 2008; Sa ´enz et al , 2006), alter responsiveness to the effects of antidepressant drugs(Wongwitdecha et al , 2006), and reduce hippocampal neuroplasticity factors linked to depression, such as brain- derived neurotrophic factor, neuropeptide Y, and serotoninreceptors, in a sex-specific manner (Bj /C28rnebekk et al , 2007). In addition, evidence indicates that isolation affects these changes in a sex-specific manner.For instance, in rats,group-housed females exhibit similar levels of immobility as isolated females and more immobility compared with group-housed males; conversely, males left in isolationshow significantly more depression-like behavior comparedwith group-housed males, indicating male rats are more vulnerable to social isolation stress (Leussis and Andersen,2008).
Further, socially isolated male mice show enhanced 5-HT 1Areceptor binding compared with females in areas throughout the brain, including the hippocampus, septum,cortical amygdala, and in the periaquaductal gray, suggest-ing isolation housing could differentially alter antidepres- sant response in a sex-dependent manner (Schiller et al , 2006). There is reason for concern if long-term creatine supplementation can induce depressive behavior by means of altering brain chemistry, as creatine monohydrate is oneof the most popular dietary supplements on the market, with a 400 million dollar industry to support its use (Dalbo et al , 2008).Still, the majority of literature examining the effects of creatine supplementation on cognitive functionhas been positive for both human and animals.
In human beings, daily supplementation between 5 and 8 g/day (up to 6 weeks) reduces mental fatigue (Watanabe et al , 2002), enhances recognition memory (Ferrier et al , 2000) and working memory (Rae et al , 2003), and attenuates performance decline from significant sleep deprivation(McMorris et al , 2006). In animals, creatine supplementa- tion lessens stress responses (eg, vocalizations, spontaneous activity, corticosterone concentration) of chicks subjectedto social-separation stress (Koga et al , 2005).It remains to be seen whether creatine is making male animals more adaptive to FST stress, as becoming immobile more rapidlymay be an advantageous coping strategy in terms of energyconservation.This study offers evidence that creatine supplementation has a beneficial effect on depression-like behavior infemales and may sensitize the brain to antidepressant treatment.
Altered bioenergetics may be an important avenue for enhancing therapeutic efficacy in depression.Further studies are needed to determine the nature of endogenous creatine in the brain and the mechanisms by which it may influence affective processes.
