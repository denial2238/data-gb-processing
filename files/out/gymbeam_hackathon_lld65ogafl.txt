This study aimed to provide a meta-analytic and comprehensive review on the adverse effects of all kinds of ω-3 PUFA supplementation reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in human subjects. A systematic review of RCTs published between 1987and 2023 was carried out based on searches of 8 electronic databases.All RCTs that compared the adverse effects of ω-3 PUFAs containing eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, or both compared with controls (a placebo or a standard treatment) were included.The primary outcome was the adverse effects related to ω-3 PUFA prescription.A total of 90 RCTs showed that the ω-3 PUFA group, when compared with the placebo, had signi ﬁcantly higher odds of occurrence of diarrhea (odds ratio [OR] ¼1.257, P¼0.010), dysgeusia (OR ¼ 3.478, P<0.001), and bleeding tendency (OR ¼1.260, P¼0.025) but lower rates of back pain (OR ¼0.727, P<0.001).
The subgroup analysis showed that the prescription ω-3 PUFA products (RxOME3FAs) had higher ω-3 PUFA dosages than generic ω-3 PUFAs (OME3FAs) (3056.38 /C61113.28 mg/d compared with 2315.92 /C61725.61 mg/d), and studies on RxOME3FAs performed more standard assessments than OME3FAs on adverse effects (63% compared with 36%). There was no report of de ﬁniteω-3 PUFA-related serious adverse events.The subjects taking ω-3 PUFAs were at higher odds of experiencing adverse effects; hence, comprehensive assessments of the adverse effects may help to detect minor/subtle adverse effects associated with ω-3 PUFAs.This study was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42023401169.

Several studies have demonstrated the bene ﬁts of ω-3 PUFAs in treating mental disorders, including depression, dementia, andattention de ﬁcit hyperactivity disorder [ 2–7] as well as medical disorders, such as cardiovascular disorders, hypertriglyceridemia,and nonalcoholic fatty liver [ 8,9]. The number of clinical studies using ω-3 PUFAs for treatment has doubled in the past 2 decades, and more trials used higherthan the minimum daily recommended nutritional supplemen-tation dosage (200 –500 mg DHA þEPA), which may also vary by country [ 10,11].In addition, some of the clinical studies focused on patients comorbid with several medical disorders, e.g., pa- tients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or dyslipidemia and pregnant mothers at risk of depression [ 12].The safety and tolerability of ω-3 PUFAs have been continuously discussed as its strengths as a potential nutritional therapeutic agent [ 7,13].
However, we should be aware that the advantages of safetymight be overestimated because there have been no extensiveinvestigations of safety in the trials testing ω-3 PUFA supple- mentation, especially ω-3 PUFAs with high-quality content (e.g., prescription ω-3 PUFAs [RxOME3FAs]). In this study, we performed a systematic review followed by a meta-analysis on the subjective and objective tolerability pro ﬁles ofω-3 PUFA supplementation in all the clinical trials in humans.Moreover, we analyzed the adverse effects by considering the quality of ω-3 PUFAs in the clinical trials.Thus, to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst large-scale meta-analysis investi- gating the potential adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnor-malities associated with ω-3 PUFA supplementation, focusing on RxOME3FAs compared with generic ω-3 PUFAs (OME3FAs) in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).Methods Protocol The present study followed the PRISMA guidelines [ 14] (Figure 1 ).
The current meta-analysis ful ﬁlled the certi ﬁcation requirements of the Institutional Review Board of the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital (approval # VGHKS17-EM10-01) and has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023401169). Statistical analysis In the present study, the meta-analytic procedures consisted of the following 2 parts: 1) dichotomous outcomes: the differ- ences in treatment-related AEs by system organ class and byMedDRA Preferred Terms or commonly used terms, and 2) continuous outcomes: the differences in treatment-related AEson laboratory measurements.The meta-analytic procedures were performed in the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 3 (CMA ver.3.0;Biostat).A 2-tailed Pvalue of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signi ﬁcance.Please refer to the Supplementary Mate- rial for the details of the methods and statistical analysis.Results Studies retrieved and characteristics The full search strategy is illustrated in Figure 1 .
A total of 331 articles entered the full-text screening stage, and 103 of themwere excluded based on our exclusion criteria ( Supplementary Tables 1-5 ). Furthermore, 90 studies were excluded because we could not extract speci ﬁc AE data from the articles or obtain the unpublished data from the corresponding authors ( Supplemen- tary Table 4 ).Finally, the remaining 90 articles were included in the present meta-analysis.Description and characteristics of the included studies The detailed characteristics of the included studies are listed inSupplementary Table 1 .In brief, the included studies origi- nated from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China,Denmark, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, South Africa, Sweden Taiwan, UK,Ukraine, and United States.All trials were published between1987 and 2023.
A total of 90 articles were included with a totalof 59,940 participants in the ω-3 PUFA treatment group (mean age¼53.67 /C611.81 y, mean female proportion ¼41.01 /C623.83 %, mean ω-3 PUFA treatment duration ¼41.52 /C663.06 wk, mean EPA dosage ¼1559.20 /C6939 mg/d, mean DHA dosage ¼ 889.05 /C6569.45 mg/d, mean EPA/DHA proportion ¼1.38/C6 0.62) and 58,490 subjects in the control group (mean age ¼ 53.58 /C612.65 y, mean female proportion ¼43.38 /C624.31%). The length of the follow-ups in the trials ranged from 1 wk to 385 wk with a median duration of 18.0 (39 interquartile range) weeks.
Among the 90 included RCTs, the characteristics of study participants included 27 studies in participants with dyslipide-mia, 22 in participants with cardiovascular diseases, 8 studies inhealthy participants, 7 studies in participants with diabetes, 3studies in pregnant women, 4 studies in patients on hemodialy-sis, 2 studies in patients with hypertension, 2 studies in patientswith Crohn ’s disease, 2 studies in patients with nonalcoholic liver diseases, and 1 study for each in participants with thefollowing clinical conditions: age-related cognitive decline, colorectal adenomas, cognitive decline, cyclosporine-treated liver transplant, depression, dry eye, dysglycemia, end-stagerenal diseases, Huntington disease, metabolic syndrome,migraine, women with obesity, psoriasis, renal transplant,stroke, and ultrahigh risk of psychotic disorder.
Among the 90Statement of Signi ﬁcance Both prescription and generic omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) might be associated with higher rates of some types of adverse effects. Moreover, although prescription ω-3 PUFAs appear to have more adverse effects than generic ω-3 PUFAs, this difference may be due to the higher dosage and the systematic evaluation of adverse effects commonly performed in the trials using prescription ω-3 PUFAs.J.P.-C.Chang et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1326 –1336 1327 included studies, 46 used RxOME3FAs (US Food and Drug Administration-approved ω-3 PUFAs for clinical application; we have updated 25 new studies since our last report [ 15]), and 44 used generic ω-3 PUFAs (OME3FAs).Methodologic quality of included studies The details of the methodologic quality assessment of included studies are provided in Supplementary Table 5 .The median of the Jadad scores of the included 90 studies was 4, witha 25% –75% interquartile range 3 –5.
Review of serious AEs Among the 90 included studies, there were no reports of serious AEs. Main results of the meta-analysis of prevalence rate of AEs in participants taking ω-3 PUFAs and controls: dichotomous items The results of the meta-analysis regarding the rate of AEs in participants taking ω-3 PUFAs and those taking the placebo were shown in Tables 1-2 andFigure 2 .In brief, we found signi ﬁcantly higher rates of “diarrhea ”(odds ratio [OR]: 1.245; 95% con ﬁ- dence interval [CI]: 1.048, 1.480; P¼0.013), “dysgeusia ”(OR: 3.478; 95% CI: 1.789, 6.762; P<0.001), and “bleeding ten- dency ”(OR: 1.260; 95% CI: 1.030, 1.541; P¼0.025), but a lower rate of “back pain ”(OR: 0.727; 95% CI: 0.632, 0.836; P<0.001) in participants receiving ω-3 PUFA supplementation than those receiving placebo ( Table 1 andFigure 2 A).
We then performed subgroup analysis on the types of ω-3 PUFAs (RxOME3FAs or OME3FAs), the ω-3 PUFA dosage (/C213000 mg/d compared with <3000 mg/d), and whether the trial performed routine standard AE evaluations (such as peri- odic AE assessment with scales). Subgroup analysis showed thatthe RxOME3FAs, a dosage /C213000 mg/d, and routine standard AE evaluations were associated with a lower OR of back pain;OME3FAs, a dosage <3000 mg/d, and routine standard AEevaluations were associated with a higher OR of diarrhea; RxOME3FAs were associated with a higher OR of bleeding ten-dency; both RxOME3FAs and OME3FAs were associated with ahigher OR of dysgeusia; and OME3FAs were associated with ahigher OR for dysgeusia than RxOME3FAs ( Table 3 , Supple- mentary Material, Supplementary Table 2 ).
Main results of the meta-analysis of differences of AEs in laboratory data from participants taking ω-3 PUFAs and controls: continuous variables The detailed results of our meta-analysis of AEs measured by laboratory data in the participants taking ω-3 PUFAs and those taking placebo are listed in Table 2 andFigure 2 B. In brief, at the end of the study period, the ω-3 PUFA group had a signi ﬁcantly lower level of non-HDL (Hedges ’g¼/C00.161), VLDL (Hedges ’g¼/C00.519), total cholesterol (T-Cho, Hedges ’g ¼/C00.056), and triglyceride (TG, Hedges ’g¼/C00.300).Subjects receiving ω-3 PUFAs also had a signi ﬁcantly lower level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP, Hedges ’g¼/C00.206), tissue plas- minogen activator (Hedges ’g¼/C00.510), hemoglobin (Hedges ’g ¼0.204), hematocrit (Hedges ’g¼0.173), mean arterial pres- sure (Hedges ’g¼/C00.546), and C-reactive protein (CRP, Hedges ’ g¼/C00.392).
On the other hand, subjects taking ω-3 PUFAs had a signiﬁcantly higher level of alanine transaminase (ALT, Hedges ’ g¼0.101), platelets (Hedges ’g¼/C00.184), and blood urea ni- trogen (BUN, Hedges ’g¼0.132). We then performed subgroup analysis to examine if our results would be affected by the types(RxOME3FAs compared with OME3FAs), the dosages of ω-3 PUFAs ( /C213000 mg/d compared with <3000 mg/d), and the application of routine standard AE evaluation.We found that the ω-3 PUFAs were associated with a better effect on triglycerides in all subgroups, regardless of ω-3 PUFA types (RxOME3FAs compared with OME3FAs), ω-3 PUFA dosage ( /C213000 mg/ d compared with <3000 mg/d), and routine standard AE eval- uations (compared with no routine standard AE evaluations).Wefound that RxOME3FAs, an ω-3 PUFA dosage of /C213000 mg/d,FIGURE 1.Flow chart of current meta-analysis.J.P.-C.Chang et al.

Chang et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1326 –1336 1330 and routine standard AE evaluations were associated with a better effect on non-HDL and VLDL in the treatment group,whereas RxOME3FAs, an ω-3 PUFA dosage of /C213000 mg/d, and routine standard AE evaluations were associated with a worseeffect on fasting glucose in the treatment group.RxOME3FAs androutine standard AE evaluations were associated with a better effect of ω-3 PUFAs on T-Cho, whereas trials using OME3FAs reported a better effect of ω-3 PUFAs on HDL ( Table 3 , Supple- mentary Material, Supplementary Table 3 ).Discussion To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst large-scale meta-analysis focusing on the safety and tolerability of all types of ω-3 PUFA supplementation.Trials using RxOME3FA and OME3FA supple-mentation were included.
Among the 90 included studies (with amedian duration of follow-up of 18 wk), there was no report ofdeﬁnite ω-3 PUFA-related serious AEs. Our study showed that patients taking ω-3 PUFAs experienced some AEs.Moreover, when we compared studies using RxOME3FAs and OME3FAs, wefound that studies using RxOME3FAs used a higher mean dosage of ω-3 PUFAs (3056.38 /C61113.28 mg/d compared with 2315.92 /C61725.61 mg/d, P¼0.009) and performed more routine standard AE evaluations (63% compared with 36%, P¼0.011).In terms of nonserious adverse effects, our ﬁndings are comprised of 3 parts: 1) treatment-related AEs; 2) treatment- related abnormal laboratory changes of lipid pro ﬁles; 3) treatment-related abnormal nonlipid laboratory changes.Treatment-related AEs (dichotomous items) Our study showed that subjects receiving ω-3 PUFAs had a higher rate of diarrhea and dysgeusia than those receiving pla-cebo.
Moreover, the occurrence of bleeding tendency was asso- ciated with RxOME3FAs but not associated with the dosages of ω-3 PUFAs. Our ﬁnding of non –dose-dependent bleeding ten- dency is consistent with the GISSI-Prevenzione study, whichshowed that daily intake of dosage higher than 3000 mg of ω-3 PUFAs was not associated with reports of higher rates ofbleeding; moreover, >80% of patients were taking aspirin concomitantly in the study [ 16].In another study conducted by Wachira et al.[ 17], ω-3 PUFAs did not increase the risk of clin- ically signi ﬁcant bleeding when used alone or in combination with anticoagulation agents.Treatment-related laboratory changes of lipid proﬁles (continuous variables) Table 2 shows that ω-3 PUFAs had signi ﬁcantly bene ﬁcial e f f e c t so nn o n - H D L ,T - C h o ,T G ,a n dV L D Lw h e nc o m p a r e dw i t hthe placebo group.ω-3 PUFAs increase the “good cholesterol ” and lower the “bad cholesterol ”by having an impact on reversecholesterol transport.
Reverse cholesterol transport is the pro- cess in which excess peripheral cholesterol is transported to theliver for hepatobiliary excretion, thus inhibiting foam cell for-mation and the development of atherosclerosis [ 18]. Both DHA and EPA have been suggested to exert atheroprotectivefunctions by promoting intracellular catabolism of apolipo- protein-B-100 –containing lipoproteins, suppressing hepatic apolipoprotein-B production, stimulating plasma TG clearancevia lipoprotein lipase, increasing the VLDL to LDL conversionrate, reducing LDL synthesis, and attenuating postprandiallipemia [ 19,20].Of note, there was a greater improvement in the serum levels of TG and T-Cho in patients receiving the RxOME3FAs but not inpatients receiving OME3FAs ( Table 3 ).This ﬁnding further supports the notion that RxOME3FAs have more bene ﬁcial ef- fects on the lipid pro ﬁle than OME3FAs.
Moreover, regardless of the ω-3 PUFA dosage and ω-3 types (RxOME3FAs compared with OME3FAs), ω-3 PUFAs lowered serum levels of TG. ω-3 PUFAs were also associated with lower TG and T-Cho levels in the trialswith routine standard AE evaluations but a higher T-Cho level inthe trials lacking standard AE evaluations.Our results suggestedthat the lipid-lowering effect of ω-3 PUFAs can be well demon- strated only if ω-3 PUFAs are RxOME3FAs and only when the trials performed routine and standard AE evaluations.Treatment-related nonlipid laboratory changes (continuous variables) The results showed that participants in the ω-3 PUFA group, when compared to those in the placebo group, had lower serum levels of ALP and CRP but a higher level of ALT and BUN(Table 2 ).
The CRP-lowering effects in the ω-3 PUFA group are consistent with those reported in previous studies in which serumCRP levels are inversely related to blood levels of DHA and EPA[21], and duration of 6-mo supplementation with ω-3 PUFAs was associated with reduced CRP serum levels [ 22]. Moreover, our ﬁndings further supported the notion that ω-3 PUFAs provide anti-in ﬂammatory effects in in ﬂammation-associated disorders through the mechanism counteracting the actions of ω-6 PUFAs [3,23].Our ﬁnding of elevated ALT levels in participants taking ω-3 PUFAs is in accordance with previous studies showing the beneﬁcial effects of ω-3 PUFAs on γ-glutamyl transferase but not on other liver function measurements, such as ALT and aspartateaminotransferase [ 24,25].
Surprisingly, the subgroup analysis of our ﬁndings showed studies that used RxOME3FAs and performed routine standardAE evaluations were associated with elevated fasting glucose anda higher level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, routine standardAE evaluations only). This is inconsistent with a previous studythat found ω-3 PUFAs were able to signi ﬁcantly reduce the risk of T2DM [ 26] but is consistent with the ﬁndings of a meta-analysis showing no bene ﬁcial effects of ω-3 PUFAs on glucose control in FIGURE 2.Forest plot of current meta-analysis of adverse events.(A) categorical outcome, (B) continuous outcome.

Chang et al. Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1326 –1336 1333 patients with T2DM [ 27].One of the possible explanations for this inconsistency of blood glucose may be due to the shortduration of some of the studies with blood glucose measure-ments included in our meta-analysis, which may not be re ﬂective of the long-term effects of ω-3 PUFAs on the nonlipid laboratory measurements, including fasting glucose and HbA1c; instead, it may underestimate the bene ﬁcial effects of ω-3 PUFAs.More- over, the heterogeneity of the study population in ourmeta-analysis should also be considered, as different populationsmay have different sensitivities to changes in blood glucose.Inaddition, the routine standard AE evaluations applied in overhalf of the RxOME3FA trials included in our meta-analysis may also help to explain our ﬁnding that subtle physiologic changes, including blood sugar levels, may be more easily detected intrials that exerted rigorous methodology than in those that didnot.
Limitations There are several limitations in this meta-analysis.

The safety and tolerability pro ﬁles may be different among different populations such as the elderly,pregnant women, or patients with other comorbidities. Second,regarding the concern about the bleeding tendency, this cannotbe answered by the current study because there were noadequate data either using binary (bleeding events) or contin- uous (bleeding time) outcomes in this meta-analysis.There is considerable debate as to the relative merits of using RCT dataas opposed to observational data in systematic reviews of AEs.In theory, well-conducted RCTs yield unbiased estimates oftreatments and AEs.However, in RCTs, the characteristics ofstudy participants are highly selected for research purpose, andthe study sample size is well designed to reach statistical powerfor estimating the treatment ef ﬁcacy [ 28].Therefore, as a meta-analysis of RCTs, the results of the present study may notbe able to identify rare or long-term AEs in real-world practice.
Conclusion In short, our meta-analysis showed that patients receiving all types of ω-3 PUFAs would experience higher rates of some mild AEs. Moreover, although RxOME3FAs may appear to have moreAEs than OME3FAs, these differences in the occurrence rates ofAEs may be due to the higher dosage and the systematic AEevaluations commonly performed in the trials using RxOME3-FAs.In short, ω-3 PUFAs are not without AE; however, applying routine and standard AE evaluations in trials using RxOME3FAsmay help to provide patients with complex medical comorbid-ities with a safe and tolerable treatment option.Author contributions The authors ‘responsibilities were as follows –PTT: had full access to all the data in the study and takes responsibility for theintegrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis; KPS:concept and design of the study; JPC, PTT, BSZ, CHC: acquisi-tion, analysis, and interpretation of data.JPC, PTT, BSZ: draftingof the manuscript.
