2Abstract 32 Background 33 Previous epidemiological studies of the associations between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) 34 and cancer incidence have been inconsistent. We investigated the associations of plasma omega- 35 3 and omega-6 PUFAs with the incidence of overall and 19 site-specific cancers in a large 36 prospective cohort.37 Methods 38 253,138 eligible UK Biobank participants were included in our study.With a mean follow-up of 39 12.9 years, 29,838 participants were diagnosed with cancer.The plasma levels of omega-3 and 40 omega-6 PUFAs were expressed as percentages of total fatty acids (omega-3% and omega-6%).41 Results 42 In our main models, both omega-6% and omega-3% were inversely associated with overall 43 cancer incidence (HR per SD = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96-0.99; HR per SD = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.97- 44 1.00; respectively).
Of the 19 site-specific cancers available, 14 were associated with omega-6% 45 and five with omega-3%, all indicating inverse associations, with the exception that prostate 46 cancer was positively associated with omega-3% (HR per SD = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01 - 1.05). 47 Conclusions 48 Our population-based cohort study in UK Biobank indicates small inverse associations of plasma 49 omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs with the incidence of overall and most site-specific cancers, 50 although there are notable exceptions, such as prostate cancer.51 Keywords 52 Polyunsaturated fatty acids, Omega-6 fatty acids, Omega-3 fatty acids, Cancer incidence, 53 Prospective cohort study 54 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 22, 2024.

Breast, lung, and colorectal cancer account for over 30% of the 57 total annual incidence [ 1].Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been postulated to influence 58 cancer incidence and survival [ 2-4].Potential mechanisms of PUFAs in cancer etiology include 59 serving as precursors to lipid mediators regulating metabolic pathways and inflammatory 60 responses [ 5], and altering membrane composition that could affect cell signaling pathways [ 6].61 62 Despite extensive interest and research, the links between PUFAs and cancer remain 63 inconclusive.
An umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational studies of cancer incidence 64 concluded that there was no convincing evidence regarding the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on the 65 risk of any cancer, and that there was only weak evidence supporting inverse associations of 66 omega-3 intake with liver, breast, and brain cancers [ 3]. A meta-analysis of observational studies 67 of cancer survival found that the intake of fish or marine omega-3 PUFAs, but not total omega-3 68 PUFAs, was associated with lower mortality in cancer patients [ 7].A meta-analysis of 69 randomized trials showed that increasing marine omega-3 PUFAs had little or no effects on 70 overall cancer diagnosis or cancer death, while the effects of increasing omega-6 PUFAs were 71 unclear because the evidence was of very low quality [ 2].
These systemic reviews showcase the 72 limitations of existing studies, which include large between-study heterogeneity, small study bias, 73 insufficient case numbers, and short follow-up time. Moreover, most studies relied on self- 74 reported fish oil supplementation or estimated dietary intake, which may suffer from recall errors, 75 outdated food databases, and measurement inaccuracy [ 8].Circulating biomarkers provide more 76 objective measures of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA status and are reflective of dietary intakes [ 9].77 Indeed, a meta-analysis of prospective studies found that the blood level of omega-6 PUFAs, but 78 not their intake, was inversely associated with overall cancer risk [ 10].Similarly, another meta- 79 analysis showed that the blood level of omega-3 PUFAs, but not their intake, was associated with 80 a lower colorectal cancer risk [ 11].
Addressing the limitations of current studies and examining 81 objective blood levels of PUFAs may offer clarity into the roles of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs 82 in cancer risk. 83 84 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.21.24301568doi: medRxiv preprint 4UK Biobank is a large population-based prospective cohort that has followed over 500,000 85 participants since 2006 [ 12].It is a large homogeneous cohort with a long follow-up time, 86 offering an unprecedented opportunity to examine the effects of PUFAs on overall cancer and a 87 comprehensive range of site-specific cancers.
A few early studies have revealed that fish oil 88 supplementation or dietary omega-3 PUFA intake was associated with lower incidence of colon 89 cancer, lung cancer, or liver cancer [ 13-15]. Recently, UK Biobank obtained metabolomic 90 measurements of baseline plasma samples for about 60% of the participants, a random subset of 91 the full cohort [ 16].Leveraging this valuable dataset, we previously showed that circulating 92 levels of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs were both inversely associated with overall cancer 93 mortality [ 17].In this study, we aim to examine the associations of circulating omega-3 and 94 omega-6 PUFAs, as well as their ratio (i.e., omega-6/omega-3), with the incidence of overall and 95 19 site-specific cancers in UK Biobank.96 97 Methods 98 Study population 99 Between 2006 and 2010, UK Biobank recruited over half a million participants, aged 37-73, in 100 22 assessment centers across England, Wales and Scotland.
During the baseline assessment visit, 101 a wide variety of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related data were acquired through self- 102 administered touch-screen questionnaires, concise computer-assisted interviews, and physical 103 and functional measures. Blood, urine, and saliva samples were also collected.Of the 502,366 104 participants, those who had cancer diagnoses at baseline (n=37,737, excluding nonmelanoma 105 skin cancer with an ICD-10 code of C44), those who had withdrawn from UK Biobank 106 (n=1,227), and those with missing data on the plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids (n=210,264) 107 were excluded from our study.A total of 253,138 eligible participants were eventually included.
108 Ascertainment of exposures 109 The absolute concentrations of plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were assessed using 110 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in plasma samples obtained at the baseline visit from 2007 to 111 2010, and the corresponding percentages of total fatty acids were calculated [ 12, 16 ]. The 112 omega-3 fatty acids to total fatty acids percentage (omega-3%) and the omega-6 fatty acids to 113 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.21.24301568doi: medRxiv preprint 5total fatty acids percentage (omega-6%) were the primary exposures of interest in this study.
In 114 addition, we conducted analyses on the ratio of plasma omega-6/omega-3 PUFAs, 115 docosahexaenoic acid to total fatty acids percentage (DHA%), and linoleic acid to total fatty 116 acids percentage (LA%). No other individual PUFAs, except DHA and LA, were measured by 117 the NMR metabolomic platform.118 Ascertainment of outcomes 119 The primary outcomes were the first incidence of overall and 19 site-specific cancers based on 120 diagnostic records in cancer registers ascertained from National Health Service (NHS) central 121 registers [ 12].At the time of our analysis (15 August 2023), we had access to the most current 122 health outcomes dataset (Version: July 2023), which contained cancer incidence records up to 19 123 December 2022.Consequently, follow-up time was calculated from the recruitment date until the 124 aforementioned date, any cancer diagnosis or death, whichever came first.
The incidence of 125 cancer was coded according to the World Health Organization's International Statistical 126 Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 or ICD-10 codes. Participants who had cancer at baseline 127 (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) were excluded.ICD-9 codes were only used for pre- 128 existing cancer and thus excluded.New cancer incidence was defined based on ICD-10 codes 129 for overall cancer (C00-C97, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, C44) and the following 19 130 site-specific cancers: head and neck (C00-C14), esophagus (C15), stomach (C16), colon (C18), 131 rectum (C19-C20), hepatobiliary tract (C22-C24), pancreas (C25), lung (C33-C34), malignant 132 melanoma (C43), connective soft tissue (C49), breast (C50), uterus (C54-C55), ovary (C56), 133 prostate (C61), kidney (C64-C65), bladder (C66-C67), brain (C70-C72), thyroid (C73), and 134 lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues (C81-C96).
135 Covariates 136 The initial questionnaire covered a comprehensive range of potential confounding factors: 137 demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity); socioeconomic status, as measured by 138 the Townsend Deprivation Index (TDI); lifestyle behaviors (e.g., alcohol consumption, smoking 139 status, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity); and history or family history of diseases 140 (e.g., diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease and family history of cancer). Body mass index 141 (BMI) was calculated from weight and height expressed in kg/m2.Waist circumference and hip 142 circumference were recorded at a central registry, and we calculated the corresponding waist-hip 143 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 22, 2024.

The TDI, employed as a measure of 144 socioeconomic deprivation, was directly obtained from the UK Biobank database, with a higher 145 score indicating a higher level of socioeconomic deprivation.146 Statistical analyses 147 We began by summarizing and comparing participant characteristics based on the quintiles of the 148 plasma omega-6% and omega-3% at baseline using descriptive statistics.To assess the 149 differences in demographic features across these quintiles, we employed Pearson's Chi-squared 150 test for categorical variables and the ANOV A test for continuous variables.151 152 To explore the associations with cancer incidence for plasma omega-6%, omega-3%, and their 153 ratio, we utilized multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard 154 ratios (HRs) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
We developed three 155 distinct models, namely, the simply adjusted model, the main model, and the additionally 156 adjusted model. Within the simply adjusted model, age and sex were designed as stratification 157 variables owing to their violation of the assumptions inherent to the proportional hazards model.158 The main model was additionally adjusted for ethnicity (classified into White, Black, Asian, 159 Others), TDI (continuous), assessment center (categorical), BMI (kg/m2; continuous), smoking 160 status (categorized as never, previous, current), alcohol intake status (categorized as never, 161 previous, current), and physical activity (classified as low, moderate, high).In addition to 162 investigating the overall cancer, we also performed separate analyses for each site-specific cancer.163 The analysis of prostate cancer was restricted to the male sample, whereas the investigation of 164 breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and uterine cancer was limited to the female sample.
Furthermore, 165 to adjust for additional possible confounding variables, we incorporated additional covariates 166 into the analysis for certain cancer types (i.e., additionally adjusted models), guided by previous 167 literature and biological plausibility [ 15]. More details can be found in Table S1.168 169 Our analysis treated the exposures of interest both in continuous (standardized to a mean of 0 and 170 standard deviation of 1) and categorical (in quintiles) terms.When conducting trend tests, we 171 used the median value of each quintile as a continuous variable within the models.Given 19 172 distinct cancer subtypes, we adopted the False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach to address the 173 issue of increasing false positives arising from multiple testing and reported the adjusted p- 174 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In addition to the two above-described analyses, we assessed if there were any 183 differences among the HRs across the five quintiles by applying likelihood ratio tests. 184 185 In secondary analyses aiming at investigating potential variations in associations within distinct 186 population subgroups, we replicated the aforementioned analyses for overall cancer while 187 stratifying the data by the following factors: age (< vs.≥ the median age of 58 years), sex (male 188 vs.female), TDI (< vs.≥ the population median of -2), BMI (< vs.≥ 25), current smoking status 189 (yes vs.no), current alcohol consumption status (yes vs.no) and level of physical activity (low 190 and moderate vs.high).The exposures of interest (omega-6%, omega-3%, and their ratio) were 191 categorized in quintiles.For each stratification variable, we conducted a likelihood ratio test to 192 obtain the associated p-value for interaction.
In the case of continuous stratification variables (i.e., 193 age, TDI, and BMI), we calculated interaction p-values based on a one-unit alteration of the 194 respective stratification variables. 195 196 Furthermore, we carried out a series of sensitivity analyses.First, to assess whether the 197 association of plasma omega-6% with overall cancer risk would be altered by omega-3% or vice 198 versa, we replicated the main analysis for overall cancer while involving both omega-6% and 199 omega-3% as variables in the model.The correlation between omega-3% and omega-6% was 200 assessed by the Pearson correlation.Second, to explore the effects of individual fatty acids, DHA 201 and LA, on cancer incidence, we repeated the main analysis on DHA% and LA%.
Third, to 202 investigate the potential impact of reverse causation on the observed associations, individuals 203 who experienced outcomes within the first year or the first three years of the follow-up period 204 were excluded from the analysis. Last, to evaluate the representativeness of the study participants, 205 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.21.24301568doi: medRxiv preprint 8we conducted a comparative analysis of baseline characteristics between those individuals with 206 exposure information and those without it.All p-values were assessed using a two-sided 207 approach.
Statistical significance was defined as a p-value less than 0.05 or a 95% confidence 208 interval that did not include the value 1.0 for the corresponding HRs. We conducted all analyses 209 using R (version: 4.0.3).210 211 Results 212 Baseline characteristics 213 Within our analytical cohort of 253,138 participants, spanning an average follow-up period of 214 12.9 years, a total of 29,838 individuals were diagnosed with cancer during follow-up.The 215 baseline characteristics of all participants distributed across quintiles of plasma omega-6% and 216 omega-3% were summarized in Table 1 and Table S2, respectively.On average, study 217 participants were approximately 56 years old, with 90% of them identifying as White.Those in 218 the higher quintiles of plasma omega-6% tended to be younger, female, with lower BMI and 219 more physically active, and were less likely to smoke or drink alcohol.
220 Associations of plasma omega-6, omega-3, and their ratio with cancer risk 221 The findings for the associations of plasma omega-6% and omega-3% with the incidence of 222 overall and site-specific cancer are shown in Figure 1, with more detailed information in Tables 2 223 and 3. In the main models with continuous omega-6% and omega-3%, each standard deviation 224 (SD) increase in the percentage was associated with a 2% (HR per SD = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96- 225 0.99, p < 0.01) and 1% (HR per SD = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.97 - 1.00, p = 0.03) decline in risk of 226 overall cancer for omega-6% and omega-3%, respectively.Additionally, categorizing omega-6% 227 and omega-3% into quintiles revealed that higher concentrations were linked to a decreased 228 overall cancer risk, with a significant trend observed for both omega-6% and omega-3% (p trend < 229 0.05).230 231 We performed similar analyses for 19 site-specific cancers.
In the main models with continuous 232 exposure, omega-6% was inversely associated with the risk of 13 site-specific cancers (corrected 233 p < 0.05, Figure 1). If considering the trend across the quintiles in the main models, all but two 234 site-specific cancers had inverse associations with omega-6%.The two exceptions were prostate 235 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.21.24301568doi: medRxiv preprint 9cancer and malignant neoplasms of lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues (corrected p trend < 0.05, 236 Table 2).
As for omega-3%, only five site-specific cancers had significant associations in the 237 main analysis with continuous exposure (Figure 1), and the trend analysis across quintiles did not 238 reveal additional significant associations (Table 3). Cancers at four sites, including stomach, 239 colon, hepatobiliary tract, and lung, were inversely associated with both omega-6% and omega- 240 3%.Only one site-specific cancer, prostate cancer, was associated with omega-3% (HR per SD = 241 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01 - 1.05, corrected p = 0.049) but not omega-6% (HR per SD = 1.01, 95% CI 242 = 0.98 - 1.03, corrected p = 0.56).In the sensitivity analysis of 10 site-specific cancers by 243 additionally adjusting for site-specific covariates, most of the above-mentioned significant 244 associations remained, except the associations of omega-6% with cancers at breast, uterus, and 245 ovary (Figure 2).
In summary, we counted associations that were statistically significant in the 246 main models with either continuous exposure analysis or trend analysis, and that remain 247 significant after adjusting for additional site-specific covariates when appropriate. There were 14 248 site-specific cancers associated with omega-6% and five with omega-3%, with an overlap of four 249 between these two groups.Only four site-specific cancers (i.e., ovary, breast, uterus, and 250 lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues) were not associated with either omega-3% or omega-6%.251 252 We also conducted analysis of the omega-6/omega-3 ratio (Table S3, Figure S1).A higher 253 omega-6/omega-3 ratio was associated with a higher overall cancer risk (p trend = 0.038).A total 254 of three site-specific cancers showed evidence of positive associations with the ratio.
Every SD 255 increment in the ratio was associated with a 2% increase in the risk of rectum cancer, and the 256 association remained unchanged after additionally controlling for site-specific covariates (per SD 257 HR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01 - 1.03, p = 0.003). When examining trends across quintiles, lung 258 cancer was significant in the main model (corrected p trend = 0.011) and remained significant after 259 adjusting for additional covariates (p trend < 0.001).Colon cancer was significant in the 260 additionally adjusted model (p trend = 0.015).261 262 In addition to the trend analysis across quintiles, we assessed if there were any differences across 263 the association effect sizes of quintiles by applying likelihood ratio tests.Most of the PUFAs- 264 cancer relationships with significant trends were also statistically significant in the overall 265 likelihood ratio tests.On the other hand, there were two pairs of relationships whose trend 266 .

The other pair was 271 omega-6% and uterus cancer (additionally adjusted model, p trend = 0.97, p overall = 0.022), and 272 there was an inverse association in the Quintile 5 (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.66-0.99). 273 Stratified analyses for plasma omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids 274 Stratified analyses were conducted to assess potential effect modifications by age, sex, TDI, BMI, 275 smoking status, alcohol consumption status, and physical activity, as shown in Table 4.The 276 observed inverse associations of plasma omega-6% with overall cancer risk appeared to be 277 notably more pronounced in the younger age group (p for interaction <0.001) and in females (p 278 for interaction = 0.006), with no apparent modification by the remaining potential stratification 279 variables.
Moreover, the estimated inverse associations of plasma omega-3% with overall cancer 280 risk demonstrated a tendency to be stronger in the older group (p for interaction < 0.001), in 281 males (p for interaction = 0.002), and in current smokers (p for interaction = 0.017). 282 Restricted cubic spline analysis 283 In the restricted cubic spline analysis, it is noteworthy that significant inverse associations were 284 observed for omega-6% and omega-3% with the overall cancer incidence (p < 0.05 for both 285 variables, as shown in Figure S2).Moreover, potential nonlinearity was identified for the 286 relationship between omega-3% and overall cancer incidence (p < 0.05).This finding suggests 287 that the protective effect of omega-3 PUFAs may exhibit enhanced efficacy at the lower 288 concentration level.Due to the possible presence of a nonlinear association between omega-6% 289 and prostate cancer, we further performed cubic spline analysis for prostate cancer.
We found 290 evidence of nonlinearity between omega-6% and prostate cancer, with the intermediate level of 291 omega-6% associated with the highest risk (p = 0.02, Figure S3). 292 Sensitivity analyses 293 In order to evaluate whether the associations between plasma omega-6% and overall cancer risk 294 might undergo modification by omega-3%, or vice versa, both omega-6% and omega-3% were 295 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.21.24301568doi: medRxiv preprint 11simultaneously integrated into the same models (as detailed in Table S4 and Table S5).The 296 correlation between plasma omega-6% and omega-3% was relatively low, with r = -0.12 (p < 297 0.01).
After their inclusion in the same models, the associations of both plasma omega-6% and 298 omega-3% with overall cancer risk remained statistically significant. The results for DHA% and 299 LA% were consistent with those for omega-3% and omega-6%, respectively (as detailed in Table 300 S6 and Table S7).Additionally, when we excluded participants who experienced cancer or death 301 within the first year or the first three years of follow-up, the outcomes remained unchanged (as 302 detailed in Table S8 and Table S9).It is worth noting that the baseline characteristics were 303 comparable between participants with and without exposure information, as evidenced by Table 304 S10.305 306 Discussion 307 Our population-based prospective cohort study in UK Biobank revealed that higher plasma 308 omega-6% and omega-3% were both associated with a lower incidence of overall cancer.
The 309 overall association effect sizes in the main model were 2% and 1% reductions per SD of omega- 310 6% and omega-3%, respectively. The association of omega-6% with cancer risk was independent 311 of most risk factors examined, including TDI, BMI, smoking status, alcohol status, and physical 312 activity.The observed inverse associations of plasma omega-6% appeared to be notably more 313 pronounced in the younger age group and in women.On the other hand, the inverse associations 314 of plasma omega-3% with overall cancer incidence were stronger in the older age group, in men, 315 and in current smokers.The inverse associations of omega-6% and omega-3% with overall 316 cancer incidence were robust to a list of sensitivity analyses.
In terms of the incidence of 19 site- 317 specific cancers, 14 were associated with omega-6% and five with omega-3%, all exhibiting 318 inverse associations (3% - 7% reduced risk per SD of omega-6%; 5% - 8% reduced risk per SD 319 of omega-3%), with the exception that prostate cancer was positively associated with omega-3% 320 (3% increased risk). Only four site-specific cancers (i.e., ovary, breast, uterus, and lymphoid and 321 hematopoietic tissues) were not associated with either omega-3% or omega-6%.322 323 Despite a large number of studies, the links between PUFAs, especially omega-6 PUFAs, and the 324 incidence of overall cancer remain ill-defined.Most existing studies examined dietary PUFAs or 325 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 22, 2024.

A 2019 prospective cohort study found no 326 significant associations of omega-3 or omega-6 PUFA intakes with the overall cancer incidence 327 [19].A 2020 meta-analysis of randomized trials showed that increasing dietary long-chain 328 omega-3 PUFAs had little or no effects on overall cancer diagnosis or cancer death, while the 329 effects of increasing dietary omega-6 PUFAs were unclear because the evidence was of very low 330 quality [ 2].A 2022 meta-analysis of observational studies revealed that fish intake and marine 331 omega-3 PUFA intake were associated with lower mortality in patients with overall cancer [ 7].332 Of note, a 2020 meta-analysis of prospective studies showed that the blood level of omega-6 333 PUFAs (highest vs.lowest category RR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.86 - 0.98), but not their intake, was 334 inversely associated with overall cancer risk [ 10].
They also found that the protective association 335 was stronger in women than in men, consistent with our findings. In the context of UK Biobank, 336 a 2021 prospective study demonstrated that regular fish oil supplementation was associated with 337 a lower incidence of overall cancer, but only in participants who consumed fatty fish less than 338 two times per week (HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.94 - 0.99), not in those who consumed more than 339 twice per week (HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.95 - 1.07).Their subgroup analysis further unraveled 340 that men were more likely to gain benefits from fish oil supplementation than women [ 15].341 Consistently, our study found that the plasma level of omega-3 PUFAs was inversely associated 342 with overall cancer incidence and that the association was only significant in men.
Moreover, a 343 2023 study of circulating PUFAs and cancer mortality by our group revealed that both plasma 344 omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs were inversely associated with cancer mortality (highest vs. 345 lowest quintile HR = 0.75, 95% = 0.65 - 0.87; HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.68 - 0.92; respectively) 346 [17].Overall, our findings provide support for possible small net protective roles of omega-3 and 347 omega-6 PUFAs in the development of new cancer incidence.Our study also suggests that the 348 usage of circulating blood biomarkers captures different aspects of dietary intake, reduces 349 measurement errors, and thus enhances statistical power.The differential effects of omega-6% 350 and omega-3% in age and sex subgroups warrant future investigation.351 352 In our study, we observed site-specific associations of omega-3 PUFAs with cancer incidence.
A 353 higher plasma level of omega-3 PUFAs was associated with a significant reduction in the 354 incidence of digestive system cancers (including colon, stomach, and hepatobiliary tract) and 355 lung cancer. However, it appeared to be linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer.The 356 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.21.24301568doi: medRxiv preprint 13observed protective associations between plasma omega-3 PUFAs and the incidence of digestive 357 system cancers and lung cancer are consistent with recent studies of fish oil supplementation and 358 dietary intake in UK Biobank [ 13-15].
Regular fish oil supplementation was associated with 359 lower incidence of colon cancer (HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.8-0.98), hepatobiliary cancer (HR = 360 0.72, 95% CI = 0.58-0.91), and lung cancer (HR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.78-0.96) [ 15]. Another 361 independent analysis of UK Biobank data revealed a 44% lower risk of liver cancer incidence 362 among fish oil users [ 14].Dietary intake of omega-3 PUFAs was associated with an 18% 363 decreased risk in lung cancer incidence (HR=0.82, 95% CI= 0.73-0.93; per 1g/d) [ 13].Notably, 364 some studies and meta-analyses did not find significant associations of dietary omega-3 PUFAs 365 and fish oil supplementation with colorectal cancer [ 3, 20, 21].
However, a recent meta-analysis 366 showed that while the dietary intake of omega-3 PUFAs was not associated with the colorectal 367 cancer risk (relative risk, RR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.90 - 1.04 for the highest versus lowest 368 category), the blood level of omega-3 PUFAs was associated with a lower risk (RR = 0.79, 95% 369 CI = 0.64 - 0.98) [ 11]. Regarding prostate cancer, most studies did not find significant 370 associations with dietary intake or blood level of omega-3 PUFAs [ 3, 15, 22-24 ].However, the 371 few statistically significant findings suggest that dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) 372 was associated with a lower prostate cancer risk, while both dietary intake and blood level of 373 DHA were associated with a higher risk [ 3, 23, 25 ].Our study found that plasma omega-3% and 374 DHA% were both positively associated with the risk of prostate cancer.
Further studies are 375 warranted to explore the roles of individual omega-3 PUFAs in the etiology of prostate cancer. 376 377 In our investigation of omega-6 PUFAs, we observed inverse associations of plasma omega-6 378 PUFAs with 14 site-specific cancers at head and neck, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, 379 hepatobiliary tract, pancreas, lung, malignant melanoma, connective soft tissue, kidney, bladder, 380 brain, and thyroid.Moreover, an increased omega-6/omega-3 PUFAs ratio was associated with 381 elevated risks of rectum, colon, and lung cancer.Notably, the evidence on the associations 382 between omega-6 PUFAs, the omega-6/omega-3 ratio, and site-specific cancers was limited and 383 exhibited varying results.Two prospective cohort studies did not establish significant links 384 between dietary omega-6 PUFAs and colorectal cancer [ 20, 21 ].
However, in agreement with our 385 findings, another prospective cohort study observed that omega-6 PUFA intake was inversely 386 associated with the risk of digestive cancer (including esophagus, liver, stomach, pancreas, and 387 .

A systematic review 391 and meta-analysis of eight previous studies also found no apparent association between dietary 392 omega-6 PUFAs and prostate cancer [ 23], in line with our findings from trend analysis. 393 However, we did find evidence for the possible presence of a nonlinear relationship, with 394 intermediate levels of omega-6% associated with the highest risk of prostate cancer.There were 395 three site-specific cancers at breast, uterus, and ovary that were inversely associated with plasma 396 omega-6% in our main models, but these associations disappeared after controlling for site- 397 specific covariates, such as age of menarche, hormone replacement therapy use, oral 398 contraceptive use, number of live births, menopausal status, and hysterectomy status.A previous 399 meta-analysis of prospective studies did observe an inverse association of the blood omega-6 400 level with breast cancer (highest vs.lowest category RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77–0.98) [ 10].
Our 401 study indicated that the consideration of site-specific covariates is critical in interpreting 402 associations. 403 404 This study has several strengths.The major strength was the prospective population-based study 405 design in UK Biobank, which provides a large sample size, long duration of follow-up, and 406 detailed information on potential confounding variables.We used the objective measurements of 407 PUFA biomarkers in plasma instead of the estimated dietary intakes from self-reported 408 questionnaires, which increases the accuracy of exposure assessment.Moreover, the cancer 409 incidence data were acquired through cancer registries to reduce selection bias.This approach 410 ensures a more representative sample, as these registries comprehensively cover a wide range of 411 demographics and cancer types, and adhere to standardized data collection protocols, thereby 412 enhancing the reliability and generalizability of our findings [ 26].
Furthermore, we adopted the 413 FDR approach when investigating site-specific cancers, to address the issue of increasing false 414 positives from multiple comparisons. In several sensitivity analyses, most of the associations 415 remain materially unchanged, indicating the robustness of our results.416 417 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.21.24301568doi: medRxiv preprint 15Some potential limitations warrant consideration in the interpretation of our findings.First, 418 despite previous indications of the representativeness of UK Biobank in sociodemographic and 419 health-related characteristics of the UK population, the potential for selective bias persists [ 27, 420 28].
Notably, the participant sample skewed heavily toward European ancestry and White 421 ethnicity, necessitating caution in generalizing results across diverse ancestral backgrounds and 422 ethnicities. Secondly, while we adjusted for multiple potential confounding variables in our 423 model, the inherent limitations of observational studies preclude the complete elimination of 424 inaccuracies in measurements, unmeasured variables, and interdependencies among factors.425 Thirdly, the number of events was small for some specific cancer sites, which may lead to the 426 limited statistical power of our study.Fourthly, our study focused on total omega-3 and omega-6 427 PUFAs.There are only two individual PUFAs measured in the UK Biobank cohort, LA and DHA.428 We showed that the associations of LA% mirrored those of omega-6%, while DHA% mirrored 429 omega-3%.Future studies into other individual PUFAs are needed.
Lastly, despite the relative 430 homogeneity of the sample, individual genetics have not been taken into account. Future studies 431 are warranted to examine if specific genetic variants or composite genetic scores modify the 432 associations of circulating PUFAs with overall or site-specific cancers.433 434 Conclusion 435 In our UK Biobank prospective cohort study, elevated levels of plasma omega-6 and omega-3 436 PUFAs were linked to reduced overall cancer risk, while a higher omega-6/omega-3 ratio was 437 associated with increased risk.The associations of omega-6 PUFAs were stronger in the younger 438 age group and in women, while the associations of omega-3 PUFAs were more prominent in the 439 older group, in men, and in current smokers.Our findings extended to the inverse associations of 440 plasma omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs with 14 site-specific cancers.One notable exception to this 441 trend of protective association was between omega-3 PUFAs and prostate cancer.
Our study laid 442 a solid foundation for future mechanistic studies into the roles of PUFAs in the etiology of 443 various cancers. It also provided insights into the development of cancer prevention strategies by 444 managing circulating PUFAs.445 446 Figure Legends 447 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.21.24301568doi: medRxiv preprint 16Figure 1.Risk estimates of the incidence of overall cancer and 19 cancer sites for 1-SD increase 448 of plasma omega-6% and omega-3%, for simply adjusted and main models.The results from 449 simply adjusted models revealed the associations stratified by age and sex in the general cohort.

The results from simply adjusted models revealed the associations of plasma omega-6% with cancer risk stratified by age and sex in general cohort. The main models were adjusted for general covariates including ethnicity (classified into White, Black, Asian, Others), Townsend deprivation index ( continuous), assessment Center, BMI (kg/m2; continuous), smoking status (categorized as never, previous, current), alcohol intake status (categorized as never, previous, c urrent), and physical activity (classified as low, moderate, high).The additionally adjusted models were adjusted for extra covariates for some specific types of cancer.a Additionally adjusted for gastroesophageal reflux disease at baseline and waist-hip ratio.b Additionally adjusted for diabetes at baseline, aspirin use, processed meat intake, waist-hip ratio, and family history.c Additionally adjusted for diabetes at baseline.d Additionally adjusted for family history.
e Additionally adjusted for skin color, ease of skin tanning, use of sun/UV protection, childhood sunburn occasions, frequency o f solarium/sunlamp use. f Restricted to female, and additionally adjusted for age when menarche started, hormone replacement therapy use, oral contracept ive use, number of live births, menopausal status, hysterectomy status, and family history.g Restricted to female, and additionally adjusted for age when menarche started, hormone replacement therapy use, oral contracep tive use, number of live births, menopausal status, hysterectomy status.h Restricted to male, and additionally adjusted for family history.i Used likelihood ratio test to compare the full model with reduced model.j Based on False Discovery Rate (FDR) to calculate the adjusted p-values for simply adjusted models and main models among 19 canc er sites.k Used the median value of each quintile as a continuous variable within the models..

The results from simply adjusted models revealed the associations of plasma omega-3% with cancer risk stratified by age and sex in general cohort. The main models were adjusted for general covariates including ethnicity (classified into White, Black, Asian, Others), Townsend deprivation index ( continuous), assessment Center, BMI (kg/m2; continuous), smoking status (categorized as never, previous, current), alcohol intake status (categorized as never, previous, c urrent), and physical activity (classified as low, moderate, high).The additionally adjusted models were adjusted for extra covariates for some specific types of cancer.a Additionally adjusted for gastroesophageal reflux disease at baseline and waist-hip ratio.b Additionally adjusted for diabetes at baseline, aspirin use, processed meat intake, waist-hip ratio, and family history.c Additionally adjusted for diabetes at baseline.d Additionally adjusted for family history.
e Additionally adjusted for skin color, ease of skin tanning, use of sun/UV protection, childhood sunburn occasions, frequency o f solarium/sunlamp use. f Restricted to female, and additionally adjusted for age when menarche started, hormone replacement therapy use, oral contracept ive use, number of live births, menopausal status, hysterectomy status, and family history.g Restricted to female, and additionally adjusted for age when menarche started, hormone replacement therapy use, oral contracep tive use, number of live births, menopausal status, hysterectomy status.h Restricted to male, and additionally adjusted for family history.i Used likelihood ratio test to compare the full model with reduced model.j Based on False Discovery Rate (FDR) to calculate the adjusted p-values for simply adjusted models and main models among 19 canc er sites.k Used the median value of each quintile as a continuous variable within the models..
