Nevertheless, the sluggish diffusion kinetics of highly polarized Mg2 + in host lattices severely hinders the development of RMBs.Herein, we report an electron injection strategy for modulating the Mo 4d-orbital splitting manner and first fabricate a dual-phase MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure to accelerate Mg2 + diffusion.The electron injection strategy triggers weak Jahn–Teller distortion in MoO6 octahedra and reorganization of the Mo 4d-orbital, leading to a partial phase transition from orthorhombic phase MoO2.8 F0.2 to cubic phase MoO2.4 F0.6 .
As a result, the designed heterostructure generates a built-in electric field, simultaneously improving its electronic conductiv ity and ionic diffusiv ity by at least one order of magnitude compared to MoO2.8 F0.2 and MoO2.4 F0.6 . Importantly, the assembled MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 //Mg full cell exhibits a remarkable reversible capacity of 172.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 , pushing forward the orbital-scale manipulation for high-performance RMBs.Keywords: rechargeable magnesium batteries, electron injection strategy, dual-phase heterostructure, electronic conductiv ity, ionic diffusiv ity INTRODUCTION Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have great potential for the next-generation energy stor- age due to low cost, high volumetric capacity (3833 mAh cm−3 ), and dendrite-free formation [1 – 3 ].
However, strong electrostatic interactions of po- larized Mg2 + and host lattice could cause sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics in RMBs, which severely restricts their development [4 ,5 ]. Thus, seeking advanced cathode materials for realizing rapid ion and charge transfer is highly desirable to al- leviate the aforementioned issue.Recently, molybdenum-based oxides have been widely explored for energy storage applications due to their high theoretical capacity and abundant crystal structure [6 ].Nevertheless, the widespread utilization of molybdenum oxides for RMBs has been restricted by their intrinsic characteristics, such as poor electrical conductivity and sluggish Mg2 + diffusivity [7 ].
Until now, extensive efforts have been devoted to overcome these weaknesses, such as enlarging interlayer spacing by preintercalation molecules or ions [8 ,9 ], shielding the strong po- larization of Mg2 + by introducing H2 O molecules [10 ], and reducing binding force by doping anions with higher polarizability [11 ]. Despite the Mg2 + migration barriers in metallic oxides in which ma- terials can be significantly reduced, the ionic dif- fusion kinetics of full cells assembled with a Mg metal anode sti l l remains a challenge in respect to the poor affinity of O2 −in the crystal frameworks and Mg2 + .F−doping can significantly reduce both the bandgap value and the Mg-ion migration barri- ers, which have been proved by theoretical calcula- tion [12 ].

Natl Sci Rev ,2024,Vol.11,nwae238 affinity of anion and Mg2 + , thereby accelerating Mg2 + diffusion along three dimensional (3D) path- ways in materials [13 ].Unfortunately, the designed electrodes usually lead to an insufficient improve- ment in magnesium storage due to uncoordinated regulation of the electronic conductivity and ionic diffusivity of materials.
In order to realize the coordination of electronic conductivity and ionic diffusivity, some researchers pay attention to the built-in electric field (BIEF) in the heterostructure materials [14 ,15 ]. The BIEF could trigger charge redistribution behavior and reg- ulate the electronic structure for achieving supe- rior conductivity of heterostructure materials [16 ].In addition, the built-in electric field could induce abundant ion adsorption and accelerate ion diffusion from a higher majority concentration to a lower ma- jority concentration in the interfaces of heterostruc- tures [17 ,18 ].However, the strategy of constructing built-in electric fields gives a simple insight into the underlying regulatory mechanisms which limit the improvement of the effect of a BIEF [19 ].In this re- gard, the deep understanding of constructing a BIEF has been regarded to be a nascent topic [20 ,21 ].
Therefore, developing a highly efficient and orbital- scale manipulation strategy to achieve the establish- ment of a BIEF is urgent but sti l l remains challeng- ing. In this work, we propose an electron injec- tion strategy to induce Mo 4d-orbital splitting manner modulation and fabricate an orthorhom- bic/cubic phase MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 (o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 ) heterostructure to im- prove Mg storage performance.The electron injection strategy triggers a weak Jahn–Teller dis- tortion in MoO6 octahedra and reorganization of the Mo 4d orbitals, leading to a partial phase transition (orthorhombic to cubic) for achieving a dual-phase MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostruc- ture.The designed heterostructure possesses an abundant built-in electric field, which simultane- ously enhances electron transfer and ion diffusion in the crystal frameworks.
The Mott–Schottky analysis and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses are employed to understand the generation and effect mechanism of the BIEF in the heterostructure. In addition, I-V tests, galvanos- tatic intermittent titration techniques (GITTs) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were investigated to test the enhancement of the elec- tronic conductivity and ionic diffusivity.As a result, the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode displays high reversible capacity (303.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 ) and excellent rate performance (154.1 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 ).Importantly, the assembled o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 //Mg ful l cel l exhibits a remarkable reversible capacity of 172.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 .Briefly, our current work provides an effi- cient strategy for achieving coordinated regulation of electronic conductivity and ionic diffusivity in cathode materials.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Oxygen (O) and fluorine (F) are adjacently located in the same period (Period II) of the Periodical Table of Elements, which were selected to form the octahedral TMX6 (where ‘TM’ is ‘transition metal’, ‘X’ is ‘O or F’) with molybdenum for the study [22 ]. However, the difference in electronegativity and va- lence electron configuration (O: 2s2 2p4 , F: 2s2 2p5 ) results in the injection of electrons and reorganiza- tion of the Mo 4d orbitals in the octahedral TMX6 when replacing the O element with an F element (Fig.1 a).The projected density of states (PDOS) calculations were performed to examine the local electron configuration of the MoO3 , o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 ( Fig.S1intheonlinesupplemen- tary file, and Fig.1 b, c).The orthorhombic phase MoO2.8 F0.2 (o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 ) reveals the asymmetric arrangement of Mo 4d orbital electrons, indicating the emergence of spin polarization after minor alio- valent F−doping.
The 4d orbit of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 is similar to that of octahedral TMO6 and sti l l retains the orthorhombic phase of MoO3 . Nevertheless, the cubic phase MoO2.4 F0.6 (c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 ) exhibits dis- tinct spin polarization, which is attributed to the weak Jahn–Teller distortion in MoO6 octahedra af- ter major aliovalent F−doping.The crystal struc- ture of MoO3 , o-MoO 2.75 F0.25 , and c-MoO 2.5 F0.5 are shown in Figs S2 and S3.Based on the crys- tal field theory, the Mo 4d orbital splitting manner of MoO3 in the quasi-octahedral field features the doubly degenerate states eg orbitals (dz2 and dx2 - y2 ) and triply degenerate states t2 g orbitals (dxz , dyz , and dxy ).Then, following the minor electron injection, the Mo 4d orbital splitting manner of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 has not changed significantly, and the crystal phase remains the in the orthorhombic phase (Fig.1 d).
After the major electron injection, major electrons spi l l over into the dxz orbital and results in the down- shift of the energy level of dxz orbitals in the Mo 4d orbital splitting manner of c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 . Therefore, the transformation of Mo 4d orbital splitting man- ner and crystal phase are transformed from the or- thorhombic phase to the cubic phase.Conclusion, minor aliovalent F−doping MoO3 (o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 ) introduces a spot of electrons and induces negligi- ble lattice distortion.Besides, major aliovalent F− doping MoO3 (c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 ) induces the reorga- nization of the Mo 4d orbitals and leads to sig- nificant lattice distortion.

(e) Schematic illustration of Mg2 + diffusion in o-MoO2.8 F0.2 , c-MoO2.4 F0.6 , and o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructures. o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 generates molybdenum vacancies for unlocking the inactive basal plane of the layered crys- tal structure.This architecture shortens ion diffu- sion length (L) along the b-axis and ac plane in the crystal frameworks.In addition, c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 ac- tivates the blocked crystal structure and increases ion diffusivity (D) in the materials.Therefore, the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure is deli- cately designed via integrating the o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 , which could simultaneously reduce Mg2 + diffusion time (t) in two aspects (t ≈L2 /D) (Fig.1 e, Fig.S4).In addition, the abundant in- terfaces in MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructures could trigger charge redistribution and regulate the electronic structure for achieving superior conduc- tivity of heterostructure materials.
Furthermore, the interfaces could induce abundant ion adsorption and accelerate ion diffusion. Based on the above analy- sis, the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure is delicately designed via the modulation of the alio- valent F−doping in MoO3 , with the specific con- trol strategy and synthesis process being summarized in Figs S5–S7 .For values of 29 < R < 79, single crys- tals of the orthorhombic phase MoO2.8 F0.2 were pre- pared with the samples being characterized by a deep blue color.For values of 14 < R < 29, products con- sisting of both phases were prepared, including the orthorhombic phase MoO2.8 F0.2 and cubic phases MoO2.4 F0.6 .However, until now, a one-step method makes it difficult to realize extremely dense o-c in- terfacial sites due to the asynchronous nucleation and growth of the two phases ( Fig.S8).
Therefore, the multi-step synthetic process of the orthorhombic phase and cubic phase MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 het- erostructure are implemented to realize an orderly layered nanostructure and dense o-c interfaces.

It’s worth noting that there is some unambiguous lattice disorder in the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure, which is caused by the reorganization of the Mo 4d orbitals. In Fig.2 b, the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern exhibits two sets of diffraction spots, which further proves the coexistence of the cubic and orthorhombic phases.To visualize the real interfacial distribution, the high-angle annular dark field STEM image (HAADF-STEM) is shown in Fig.2 c.The heterostructure composes the or- thorhombic phase MoO2.8 F0.2 with distorted MoX6 octahedra sharing edges and corners and cubic phase MoO2.4 F0.6 with regular MoX6 octahedra sharing corners.In addition, the HRTEM image by FIB treatment and in-depth Mo 3d XPS spectra distinctly reveal the two-phase feature of the het- erostructure within the bulk phase of the active ma- terial particles ( Figs S13and S14).
Moreover, SEM images and TEM images of MoO3 , o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 , and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 are shown in Figs S15–S18 . The corresponding EDS spectra confirm the proportion of the Mo, O, and F elements in o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 ( Fig.S19).In addition, the distinct color of the samples is displayed in the photographs in Fig.S20.In Fig.2 d, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal that the diffraction peaks of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure match well Page4of13 Natl Sci Rev ,2024,Vol.11,nwae238 with the orthorhombic phase MoO2.8 F0.2 (Cmcm (63), JCPDS No.25–0563) and cubic phase MoO2.4 F0.6 (Pm-3 m (221), JCPDS No.24–0770), which verifies the coexistence of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 in the heterostructure [23 ,24 ].The as-synthesized o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure has been analyzed by X-ray diffrac- tion (XRD) patterns and their Rietveld refinement ( Fig.
S21), in which the ratio of the orthorhombic phase MoO2.8 F0.2 to the cubic phase MoO2.4 F0.6 in the heterostructure is 1:1. In addition, the ratio of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 as 8:2 (denoted by MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 –1) and 2:8 (denoted by MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 –2) have been prepared to understand the correlations between phase ratios and electrochemical performance.The Raman spectra of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 , c- MoO2.4 F0.6 , and o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 het- erostructures are displayed in Fig.2 e.The peaks at 804.3 and 1005.4 cm−1 represent the Mo = X stretch- ing vibrations and X −Mo −X stretching vibrations (where X represents O or F) of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 materials, respectively ( Table S1).Besides, the characteristic peaks of c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 can be found at 837.6 and 948.4 cm−1 .
In addition, two charac- teristic peaks of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure appear at 813.1 and 845.7 cm−1 , corresponding to the Mo = X symmetric stretching vibrations of the o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 materials. Two characteristic peaks of the het- erostructure appear at 991.3 and 1002.7 cm−1 , which signifies the Mo = X asymmetric stretching vibrations of the o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 materials [25 ].Interestingly, compared with o- MoO2.8 F0.2 and c - MoO2.4 F0.6 , the peaks of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure show a slight shift, which is related to the change in the bond angles/lengths of the MoX6 octahedron during the different number of electrons injected ( Fig.S22) [26 ].In addition, the XRD pattern and Raman spectrum of MoO3 are displayed in Fig.S23.The chemical valence states of samples are explored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).In Fig.
S24, the survey spectra indicate the existence of Mo, O, and F elements in o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 , c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 , and o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructures. From the Mo 3d spectra (Fig.2 f), the peaks at 236.1 and 233.1 eV are assigned to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 signals of Mo6 + , and the peaks at 234.7 and 231.6 eV are attributed to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 signals of Mo5 + .In addition, the Mo 3d XPS spectrum of c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 shows extra peaks at 233.4 and 229.8 eV corresponding to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 signals of Mo4 + , which originate from the successful accomplishment of the major F−doping.In the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure, the Mo 3d spectrum can be fitted to three pairs of peaks that are related to Mo6 + (236.0 and 233.0 eV), Mo5 + (234.6 and 231.5 eV), and Mo4 + (233.5 and 229.9 eV) [27 ].
Remarkably, the binding energy of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure is apparently higher by ∼0.1– 0.3 eV than that in c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 , while the binding energy of the heterostructure is slightly lower com- pared to o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 . The opposite shift of Mo 3d confirms the distribution of opposite charges through the interface in o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructures [28 ].In Fig.S25, the F 1s XPS spectrum of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 het- erostructure is also red-shifted and blue-shifted compared to the o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 , respectively, which is associated with the charge transfer between o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 .As a contrast, XPS spectra of pure MoO3 are dis- played in Fig.S26.Furthermore, we have performed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra to identify the existence of molybdenum vacancies in o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 materials.As shown in Fig.
S27, compared with the pristine MoO3 sample, the o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 sample exhibits an intense EPR signal at g = 2.002 which could be at- tributed to the presence of unpaired electrons in Mo species following minor F−doping. Furthermore, the characteristic peak of the Mo −O/F dangling bond for the c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 sample is much stronger than that of the o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 sample, demon- strating a significantly increased concentration of molybdenum defects following major F−doping.These cationic vacancies are conducive to unlock- ing the inactive basal plane of the layered crystal structure and triggering shallow impurity levels in the energy band, giving rise to fast Mg2 + diffusion and electron transport during charge/discharge processes.Moreover, the Mo K-edge X-ray absorp- tion near-edge structure (XANES) analyses of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure was implemented (Fig.2 g).
The distinct pre-edge peak of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure exhibits an asymmetrical structure, which may be ascribed to the hybridization of orbitals [29 ]. The first-derivative of the XANES spectra is shown in Fig.S28.The Fourier-transform (FT) and wavelet- transform (WT) EXAFS spectra (Fig.2 h, i) confirm the existence of both Mo-O/F and Mo-Mo coor- dination [30 ].The peaks of Mo-Mo in Mo foil are concentrated at 2.47 Å, and the peaks of Mo-O/F and Mo-Mo in the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure correspond to 1.63 Åa n d 3.21 Å, respectively [31 ].

S29, the Mott–Schottky plots of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 derived from the plots of Log Z against potential exhibit a positive slope, which is a typical n-type semiconductor [34 ]. In addi- tion, the flat band potentials (Efb) of materials can be confirmed from the Mott–Schottky curves.The Efbof o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 are 0.23 and 0.19 eV vs.A g/A gCl, which are equal to 0.43 and 0.39 eV vs.normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), re- spectively.Notably, as an n-type semiconductor, the Efbis usually ∼0.1–0.3 eV (defined as 0.20 eV) more positive than their conductive band position (Ecb ) [35 ].Therefore, the Ecb of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 can be approximately estimated as 0.23 and 0.19 eV, respectively.To disclose the band gap (Eg ) of materials, the UV −vis spectra are dis- played in Fig.3 b.
Obviously, the o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 exhibit strong absorption at ∼400 nm wavelength, and the corresponding Eg values are 1.79 and 1.56 eV, respectively, which are smaller than the Eg value of pure MoO3 (3.03 eV) ( Fig. S30).The- oretically, the valence band (Evb ) is relevant to the band gap (Eg ) and conductive band (Ecb ), which can be described as [36 ]: Eg =Evb −Ecb .Thereby, the Evb of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c- MoO2.4 F0.6 can be calculated as 2.02 and 1.75 eV, respectively.Besides, the calculated work functions Page6of13 Natl Sci Rev ,2024,Vol.11,nwae238 ( φ) of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 are 4.67 and 4.59 eV, respectively ( FigsS31, and S32).The Evb , Eg , and Ecb of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 are sum- marized in Table S2.Accordingly, significant charge transfer from c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 to o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and im- balanced charge distribution are further displayed in the calculated results (Fig.3 c).
Once o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 are in intimate contact, the charge redistribution wi l l spontaneously occur near the interfaces until their Fermi levels reach equilib- rium (Fig. 3 d and e).As a result, the electrons and holes wi l l be accumulated on the o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 sides, respectively, which forms a certain built-in electric field for providing a continuous electron flow.As proof, the electrical conductivity of the o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 , c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 , and o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructures are displayed, and their calculated conductivities are 7.2 ×10−3 , 9.8 ×10−3 , and 2.1 ×10−2 S cm−1 , re- spectively (Fig.3 f).The result reveals that the BIEF in the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure significantly enhances conductivity by orders of magnitude.
To deeper understand the role of het- erojunctions in enhancing electronic conductivity and ionic diffusivity, the total density of states (TDOS) calculations and the finite element simu- lation were carried out. As shown in Fig.3 g–i, the total density of states (TDOS) of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 , c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 , and o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructures reveal that F−doping related states have emerged in the bandgap of those ma- terials.Notably, the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure displays a narrow band gap in the vicinity of the Fermi level (Ef ), which generates more unpaired electrons and electronic conduc- tion owing to the built-in electric field in the heterostructure.To clarify the merits of the heterostructure, the obtained materials were evaluated in a magnesium half-cell, in which the activated carbon cloth (AC) with high surface area and abundant active sites are used as counter electrodes.
The AC electrode delivers reversible capacities of 0.14 mAh at 0.1 A g−1 in the window between −0.15 and 0.15 V vs. A g/A gCl ( Fig.S33), which can provide enough ca- pacity and charges to balance the Mg2 + intercala- tion process in the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 elec- trode [37 ,38 ].In the half-cell, the magnesium ions derived from the electrolyte are inserted/extracted in the cathode and both anions (TFSI−) and cations (Mg2 + ) from the electrolyte are reversibly adsorbed/desorbed in the activated carbon cloth (AC) anode.The anions adsorb while the cations desorb on the surface of the AC anode during the discharge process, and vice versa during the charge process ( Fig.S34).The reaction process of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 //AC cells can be for- mulated as follows: In the discharge process: Cathode : Mo O2 .8 F0 .2 /Mo O2 .4 F0 .6 + x Mg2+ + 2 xe−→ Mg x Mo O2 .8 F0 .2 /Mo O2 .4 F0 .

4 a, the galvano- static charge-discharge (GCD) curves of o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode were performed at various current densities, which displays well- defined voltage platforms. Compared with pure o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 electrodes, the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode delivers im- proved reversible capacities of 321.7, 295.9, 258, 202.1, and 154.1 mAh g−1 at the current density 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 A g−1 , respectively (Fig.4 b).Note- worthy, the relatively high Coulombic efficiency of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure is attributed to the enhancement of electronic con- ductivity and ionic diffusivity by at least an order of magnitude.

Moreover, the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 303.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 , which is much higher than that of pure o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 (249.3 mAh g−1 ) and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 (100.6 mAh g−1 ) (Fig. 4 d).Therefore, Mg2 + prefers to insert/extract in the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 , which may be attributed to the abundant phase boundary.Furthermore, the ion diffusion coefficient (D) of electrodes was investigated by GITT tests.The D of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode is 9.12 ×10−13 to 1.99 ×10−10 cm2 s−1 , which is much higher than pure o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 electrode and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 electrode (Fig.4e; Figs S37, S38 , and S39), revealing the efficient ion transfer enabled by the dual-phase heterostructure.In addition, the D values of the MoO3 electrode is 2.27 ×10−14 to 2.5 ×10−12 cm2 s−1 ( Fig.
S40), which is much lower than o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 electrode (1.41 ×10−13 to 4.25 ×10−12 cm2 s−1 ) and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 electrode (5.55 ×10−14 to 4.15 ×10−12 cm2 s−1 ), showing that the substitution of fluorine for oxygen could activate low-valent redox-active transition metals or create more cationic vacancies. Further investigation of the correlations be- tween the phase ratios of MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure and electrochemical perfor- mance are shown in Fig.S41.Although the cation defects in the materials significantly improve the Mg2 + diffusion, the interfacical content in the MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 het- erostructure plays an even more crucial role in accelerating ion diffusion kinetics.
There- fore, the D of MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 –1 and MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 –2 electrodes ranges from 8.94 ×10−13 to 2.32 ×10−11 cm2 s−1 , which is notably lower compared to the o-c Page8of13 Natl Sci Rev ,2024,Vol.11,nwae238 MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode (4.58 ×10−13 to 1.48 ×10−11 cm2 s−1 ), indicating sluggish ion diffusion kinetics in the other phase ratios. In addition, the MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 –1 and MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 –2 electrodes exhibit a low capacity and poor cycling stability.The D values of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode is superior to the majority of previously reported molybdenum-based oxide electrodes ( Table S3).The CV curves of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode at different scan rates are displayed in Fig.S42.The b-values of the oxidation/reduction peaks are assessed at 0.88 and 0.86, respectively, demonstrating the electrochemical storage be- havior contributed by both capacitive and dif- fusion behavior.
To prove the enhancement of the cathode-electrolyte compatibility of the heterostruc- ture in magnesium ful l cel ls, we assembled o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 //Mg, MoO2.8 F0.2 //Mg, and MoO2.4 F0.6 //Mg full cells. In magnesium full cells, the MTB electrolyte was used due to its ability to achieve reversible deposition and dissolution of magnesium ( Fig.S43).Impressively, the GCD curves of o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 //Mg full cells were performed at 0.1 A g−1 ( Fig.S44), which dis- plays relatively little polarization and high reversible capacity of 172.5 mAh g−1 (Fig.4 f).The low initial Coulombic efficiency of a ful l cel l is attributed to the thermodynamic instability of a Mg/organic electrolyte interface and the electrochemical condi- tioning process of MTB electrolyte during the initial Mg2 + deposition/dissolution process.In Fig.
4 g, the rate performance of the cell was determined at different current densities and the corresponding reversible capacities are 203.3, 132.1, 73.6, 50.3, and 35.9 mAh g−1 , respectively. Furthermore, a reversible capacity of 194.1 mAh g−1 was easily restored at 0.05 A g−1 , indicating the favorable rate tolerance capabi lity of the cel l.As a contrast, the cycling performances and rate performances of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 //Mg and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 //Mg are displayed in Figs S45and S46, which are inferior to the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 //Mg cell.In addition, the magnesium storage property of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 //Mg cell is also superior to the majority of previously reported molybdenum- based materials ( Table S4).In addition, the simple Mg(TFSI) 2 /AN and Mg(TFSI) 2 /DME elec- trolyte was used in the magnesium full cells system ( FigsS47and S48).
However, these electrolytes can not support the operation of magnesium full cells due to the Mg metal passivating in polar aprotic sol- vents and the incomplete dissociation of magnesium salts. To further evaluate the kinetic in depth, in situ EIS measurement and the corresponding detailed fitting data were employed at various charge/discharge states of o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode (Fig.5 a).When gradually discharging, the electrode shows a continual decrease of resistances due to the formation of Mo4 + and rich contact of the hetero- interface during the Mg2 + insertion process.When gradually charging, the continual increase of resis- tances is attributed to the reversible Mg2 + extraction process and exhibits excellent interfacial stability within the whole cycle.As shown in Fig.S49, STEM- EDS mapping images display the uniform dispersion of the Mg element, which reveals the Mg2 + insertion during the discharge process.
In contrast, only the fuzzy Mg element outline can be observed within the charged o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode. In addition, ex-situ Mo 3d XPS spectra were per- formed to examine the valence state of Mo in the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode during the charge/discharge process (Fig.5 b).After full dis- charging to 0.01 V, the Mo4 + content is significantly improved, which derives from the reduction of Mo6 + and Mo5 + .After full charging to 2.0 V, parts of Mo4 + in the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode are returned to Mo6 + and Mo5 + , confirming the reversible evolution of the Mo valence state during the discharge/charge process.Besides, when dis- charged to 0.1 V, a sharp Mg 1s peak is observed, which indicates the surface adsorption and interca- lation of Mg2 + in the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode (Fig.5 c).When charged to 2.0 V, the Mg signals almost disappeared, implying the re- versible insertion/extraction of Mg2 + .As depicted in Fig.
S50, the peaks of Mo6 + , Mo5 + , and Mo4 + remain almost unchanged after 100 cycles, suggest- ing the high stability of the cell. In addition, the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure shows the layered and uniform nanostructure as well as the morphology are consistent with the SEM observa- tion before 100 cycles ( Fig.S51), which indicates the excellent stability of these materials.Moreover, the time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrom- etry (TOF-SIMS) of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 , c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 and o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 cathodes are implemented to explore the stability of high elec- tronic conductivity o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 in chloride-containing electrolyte systems ( Fig.S52).The presence of CH2 O−and Cl−ionic fragments is correlated with the decomposition of both the solvent and chloride in the electrolyte.
With the prolonged sputtering time, the signal intensity of CH2 O−and Cl−ionic fragments decreases and stabilizes at the same time in o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 , c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 , and o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrodes, which means that the high electronic conductivity o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 could not worsen the continuous breakdown of the Page9of13 Natl Sci Rev ,2024,Vol.11,nwae238 01 0 2 0 Z' (Ω)-Z'' (Ω) II -1 0 1 Voltage (V)IIVVCapacity (mAh g-1) IIIVI 12 16 20 24IIIIVVVI(020) MoO 2.8F0.2(040) MoO 2.4F0.6·Intensity (a.u.)III 2 theta (degree)II I I V V V IVolume (Å3)213 210 207 204 201MoO 2.8F0.2 MoO 2.4F0.6 III Volume (Å3)60 57 54 51 48 4502468Space coordinates Y ( μm) Mg2+ reference concentration0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Heterostructure MoO 2.8F0.2−1 0 1 Charge DischargeWRs Rct Ws CPEct Voltage (V)0100200300400500600 8.078.49 Capacity (mAh g-1) Rct=8.648.548.17 8.577.527.707.607.236.856.746.817.237.707.52 6.687.007.24 6.726.847.507.828.00 7.95 0 12 3 4 5 R (Å)|FT(k2χ(k))| (Å-4)Mo-O/FMo-Mo InitialCharge DischargeNormalized absorption Energy (eV)19900 20000 20100 202001.2 0.9 0.6 0.3 0.0Initial Discharge Charge Initial Discharge Charge 19998 20000 20002 20004Energy (eV)0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1Mg 1s Binding energy (eV)Intensity (a.u.) 1315 1310 1305 1300 1295ChargeDischargeMo 3dIntensity (a.u.)

The results prove that an abundant amount of Mg2 + and a mini- mal amount of MgCl+ are intercalated into the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode during the discharge/charge processes, while a substantial amount of MgCl+ is absorbed on the surface of the electrode. As a further proof, a thin CEI layer in o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 cathodes with a thickness of ∼6.5 nm is observed in the HRTEM images ( Fig.S54).To better understand the changes in valence states and charge transfer of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode during magne- siation/demagnesiation, the Mo K-edge XANES analyses were measured.During the discharge process, the Mo edge shifts toward lower energy with the slight reduction of Mo6 + and Mo5 + , and the white-line intensity decreases with the lat- tice expansion of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode (Fig.5 d).The corresponding radical distribution of R-space are provided by Fourier transform of Mo K-edge XANES spectra.As shown in Fig.
5 e, the average Mo-O/Mo-Mo bond slightly elongates and is shortened during the insertion and extraction of Mg2 + , confirming the reversible evolution of valence state and lattice structure of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode during the discharge/charge process. In addition, the het- erostructure maintains structural stability during battery operation without irreversible phase tran- sitions and significant volume changes.The ex-situ XRD patterns and variations of lattice volume of o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 at different voltage states were performed based on an AC anode (Fig.5 f, g).During the discharge and charging process, the (020) and (040) diffraction peaks of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 shift and return, and the characteristic peaks of c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 show almost no change, indicating a highly reversible Mg2 + insertion/extraction process of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrode.
To gain insights into the intrinsic properties of phases Page10of13 Natl Sci Rev ,2024,Vol.11,nwae238 affecting ionic transfer kinetics, we conducted investigations into Mg2 + migration pathways within the orthorhombic and cubic phase struc- tures using bond valence site energy (BVSE) calculations ( Fig. S55).Visibly, the orthorhom- bic phase MoO2.8 F0.2 provides intermittent and narrow zigzag paths for Mg2 + migration along the ac plane directions.Differently, the cubic phase MoO2.4 F0.6 possesses successive and broad Mg2 + migration pathways along the 3D (a, b, and c- axis) directions.Impressively, the designed o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure could trigger the reversible ion insertion/extraction and accelerate ion diffusion for achieving superior mag- nesium storage.
To further prove the Mg2 + diffusion kinetics of the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 het- erostructure, the finite element simulation of Mg2 + concentration distribution for o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructures were simulated and analyzed ( Fig. S56), in which the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure has a more uniform Mg2 + concentration and faster Mg2 + flux distribution compared to the o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 .Figure 5 h clearly and prominently dis- plays the curves of relative concentration of magne- sium ions in the structural materials, which suggests that the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostruc- ture can achieve fast and efficient ion diffusion during the charge and discharge process.Besides, we summarized the comparison of the o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 , c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 , and o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 electrodes during the Mg2 + insertion/extraction process.
CONCLUSIONS To summarize, we innovatively designed the o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure by an electron injection strategy to simultaneously en- hance electronic conductiv ity and ionic diffusiv ity in RMBs. The electron injection strategy induces weak Jahn–Teller distortion in MoO6 octahedra and Mo 4d-orbital splitting, leading to a partial phase transition from orthorhombic MoO2.8 F0.2 to cubic MoO2.4 F0.6 .The tailored dual-phase MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 heterostructure triggers the built-in electric field, which shortens ion diffu- sion length (L) and activates ion diffusivity (D) in the crystal frameworks to reduce Mg2 + diffusion time in two aspects (t ≈L2 /D).In addition, the BIEF induces charge redistribution to decrease the band gap of the electronic structure.As a result, compared to pure o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 , the electronic conductivity and ionic diffusion co- efficient of o-c MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 is improved by at least one order of magnitude.
Impressively, the electrode demonstrates a respectable reversible capacity (303.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 ) and an excellent rate performance (154.1 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 ). Even after being assembled with a Mg anode, the ful l cel l can provide a high specific capacitance of 172.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 , exhibiting great potential for practical application.This work would offer a meaningful insight to simultaneously im- prove charge transfer and ion diffusion in the crystal frameworks for superior magnesium storage.METHODS Preparation of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 materials In a typical process, 3.6 g α-MoO3 powders and 0.06 g Mo powders were mixed in 37 mL DI water.Then, 6 mL HF (wt.48%) was added to the above mixture and magnetically stirred for 1 h.Subse- quently, the solution was added into a 50 mL Teflon- lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 200°C for 20 h.After cooling down, the blue products were col- lected by centrifugation with DI water and dried at 60°C for 12 h.
Preparation of the o-c MoO 2.8 F0.2 /MoO 2.4 F0.6 heterostructure Specifically, 1.8 g of obtained MoO2.8 F0.2 powders and 0.06 g Mo powders were dissolved into 37 mL DI water. Afterward, 6 mL HF (wt.48%) was added to the above solution and magnetically stirred for 1 h.Then, the solution was directly moved to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 200°C for 20 h.Last, the deep blue products were centrifuged with DI water and dried at 60°C for 12 h.By varying the mole ratio (R) of MoO3 to Mo power in the reaction mixtures, different phase ratios of the heterostructure can be obtained, including the ratio of o-MoO 2.8 F0.2 and c-MoO 2.4 F0.6 as 8:2 (denoted by MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 –1) and 2:8 (denoted by MoO2.8 F0.2 /MoO2.4 F0.6 –2).SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Supplementary data are available at NSRonline.ACKNOWLEDGEMENT We would like to acknowledge the Synchrotron Light Research Institute (Public Organization, SLRI) for provision of beamtime.We appreciate Dr.
