Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data,and assessed risk bias of included studies. Meta-analysis was performed on Rsoftware Version 4.1.2 and STATA Version 12.0.Results: A total of 19 observational studies were included.A pooled analysis showed that the serum vit A concentrations in patients with asthma was lower than that inhealthy controls (standard mean difference (SMD)= −2.479, 95% con ﬁdence interval (CI):−3.719, −.239, 95% prediction interval (PI): −7.510, 2.552), and relatively higher vit A intake in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of asthma at age 7 years(risk ratio (RR)= 1.181, 95% CI: 1.048, 1.331).No signi ﬁcant correlation was observed between serum vit A levels or vit A intake and the risk of asthma.Conclusion: Our meta-analysis con ﬁrms that serum vit A levels are lower in patients with asthma than in healthy controls.Relatively higher vit A intake during pregnancy isassociated with an increased risk of asthma at age 7 years.
There is no signi ﬁcant correlation between vit A intake and asthma risk in children, nor between serum vit A levels and asthma risk. The effect of vit A may depend on age or developmental stage, diet and genetics.Therefore, further studies are needed to explore the association ofvit A and asthma.Systematic Review Registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ CRD42022358930 , identi ﬁer CRD42022358930 KEYWORDS vitamin A, retinol, asthma, intake, serum concentration Introduction Asthma is a respiratory diseas e characterized by recurrent a irway obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness and chronic airway in ﬂammation ( Tenero et al., 2018 ;Alashkar Alhamwe et al., 2020 ).The prevalence of self-reported, doctor-diagnosed asthma in adults worldwide is 4.3% and varies widely between countries ( Papi et al., 2018 ).

Antioxidants can counteract the damaging effects of oxidative stress and play a crucial role in maintaining respiratory health(Nadeem et al., 2003 ). Vitamin A (vit A) is a non-enzymatic antioxidant derived from plants (carotenoids) or animal origin(retinol) and it plays an important role in lung development,respiratory epithelium and immune system ( Trivillin et al., 2022 ).Vit A plays a central role in asthma by promoting T cell proliferationand prolonging their survival, enhancing antigen-presenting capacity and promoting Th2 cell response ( Malinovschi et al., 2011 ).However, the relationship between dietary vit A and risk of asthma in humans isunclear.A cross-sectional study reported that serum vit A wasnegatively correlated with the severity of asthma in children(Chérot-Kornobis et al., 2011 ).
In adults, serum retinol was inversely associated with subsequent airway obstruction ( Morabia et al., 1990 ), however it has recently been found that there was a positive correlation between vit A intake and asthma ( Mai et al., 2013 ). A follow-up trial in a vit A-de ﬁcient population showed that early gestational vit A supplementation improved lung function in offspring(Checkley et al., 2010 ), with no effect on subsequent asthma risk (Checkley et al., 2011 ).Consequently, there is an urgent need for evidence-based information obtained from systematic synthesis of studies on theassociation between vit A and asthma risk for the primary preventionof asthma onset.The aim of this systematic review was to synthetize the available scienti ﬁc evidence on the association of vit A and asthma risk, thus supporting or preventing the use of vit A.
Materials and methods This study doesn ’t require ethical approval and informed consent because it is a systematic review and meta-analysis of previously published literature and doesn ’t address ethics or patient privacy. Our study was analyzed and reported according to the PreferredReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) ( Moher et al., 2009 ).The study protocol was registered and approved in the International Prospective Register of SystematicReviews (PROSPERO) under the code CRD42022358930.Search strategy Two reviewers independently performed a comprehensive literature search in four electron ic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and the Cochrane Library.All databaseswere searched from inception to November 2022.The followingMeSH terms and keywords were searched ( “vitamin A ”OR “vit A ” OR “aquasol A ”OR “retinol ”OR “all-trans-retinol ”OR “vitamin A1”OR “11-cis-retinol ”)A N D( “asthma ”OR “asthmas ”OR “bronchial asthma ”).
References within the identi ﬁed articles were manually examined to identi fy other potentially eligible studies. The details of the search strategy were provided inSupplementary Material S1 .Inclusion and exclusion criteria The following criteria were prede ﬁned for inclusion of a study: 1) the original observational or interventional study reported therelationship between vit A and asthma risk; ii) the study providedthe serum vit A or vit A intake levels, relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) and 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CIs); iii) cases were diagnosed with asthma (informed by clinician).The exclusion criteria were asfollows: i) the cases weren ’t only asthma patients, but also patients with wheezing, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or otherallergic disease, resulting in the inability to independently obtainthe association of vit A and asthma; ii) studies with insuf ﬁcient data; iii) reviews or meta-analyses, conference abstract, and studyprotocols.
Data extraction and quality assessment Screening of studies, selection, exclusion, and data extraction were performed by two reviewers independently. Any disagreements werediscussed and reached a consensus.We extracted the followinginformation from case-control and cohort studies: ﬁrst author, publication year, study location and design, participants, age, vitamin measurements, statistical methods and outcomes of interest.Case-control and cohort studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) ( Wells et al., 2014 ) consisting of three domains: 1) selection of subjects, 2) comparability of groups,and 3) assessment of outcome.A score of 0 –9 was allocated to each relevant study.While the NOS has no established thresholds, weconsidered the quality of each study as low (0 –3 score), moderate (4–6 score), or high (7 –9 score) ( Chung et al., 2021 ).
Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed with R software Version 4.1.2 and STATA Version 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX,United States). Data of dichotomous outcomes were pooled using the risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR) and presented as the 95% conﬁdence interval (CI).Continuous outcomes were pooled using the standard mean difference (SMD) and 95%CI.Heterogeneity wasassessed statistically by using the Cochran ’s Q test, I 2and Tau2 statistic and 95% prediction interval (PI) ( Bowden et al., 2011 ; IntHout et al., 2016 ).When p>0.1 or I2≤50%, the results of the associated studies were considered to have no signi ﬁcant heterogeneity, and a ﬁxed-effects model was utilized.When p≤ 0.1 or I2>50%, it was considered that there was heterogeneity in the results of the included studies, and a random-effects model wasselected ( Higgins and Thompson, 2002 ).
The presence of publication bias was assessed with the Begg ’s adjusted rank correlation test and the Egger ’s regression asymmetry test ( Begg and Mazumdar, 1994 ;Sterne and Egger, 2001 ). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the possible sources of heterogeneity.Trial sequential analysis We performed a trial sequential analysis (TSA) to assess if the available evidence is up to the required information size (RIS) for Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 02Hu et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1100002 robust conclusion ( Wetterslev et al., 2017 ).For continuous outcomes, the trial sequential analysis was performed using TSA v0.9.5.10 Beta software ( www.ctu.dk/tsa ).In the present trial sequential analysis, we estimated the RIS and built O ’Brien- Fleming α-spending boundaries by using type I error of 5% and type II error of 20%, which were two-side values.
If the cumulativeZ-curve crossed the trial sequent ial monitoring boundary or RIS boundary, no further trials were considered to be needed and ﬁrm evidence was obtained. Results Literature search The initial search identi ﬁed 1986 relevant studies.After 344 duplicate studies were excluded, 1,642 articles remained.Then 1,584 articles were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts according to the eligibility criteria and 58 potentialarticles were reviewed for full text.After reading the full text,39 articles didn ’t meet the inclusion criteria: nine studies were review articles; 20 articles provided insuf ﬁcient data; 10 articles reported wheezing or other allergi c disease.
Finally, 19 eligible studies were included in the present meta-analysis ( Figure 1 ) (Hijazi et al., 2000 ;Arora et al., 2002 ;Harik-Khan et al., 2004 ; Rubin et al., 2004 ;Mizuno et al., 2006 ;Murray et al., 2006 ;Al Senaidy, 2009 ;Rosenlund et al., 2012 ;Nakamura et al., 2013 ; Maslova et al., 2014 ;Lee et al., 2015 ;Kim et al., 2016 ;Bishopp et al., 2017 ;Kodama et al., 2017 ;Bai and Dai, 2018 ;Parr et al., 2018 ; Muhsen et al., 2019 ;Talaei et al., 2021 ;Podlecka et al., 2022 ).Characteristics and quality assessment of the included studies 16 case-control studies and three cohort studies were included in our meta-analysis. Studies were performed in Asia, Europe andAmerica, respectively.The participants were asthmatic patients ornon-asthmatics, including children, adolescents and adults.Weextracted the outcomes of serum vit A and vit A intake levels inthe asthma and healthy group.
As the studies of Bai and Bishopp showed, the study population was respectively divided into Severe, Moderate, Mild, Control groups ( Bai and Dai, 2018 ) and Severe asthma, Mild asthma, Healthy controls ( Bishopp et al., 2017 ). We extracted the serum vitamin A levels of “Severe vs.Control, ” “Moderate vs.Control, ”“Mild vs.Control ”and they were represented by “Bai 2018a, ”“Bai 2018b ”and “Bai 2018c ” respectively.The OR or RR and their 95% CI were extracted toevaluate the association between vit A and asthma ( Table 1 ).Three case-control studies were considered as moderate quality.The other 13 case-control and three cohort studies were assessed as high quality,because the study design had been described in detail ( Supplementary Material S2 ).Comparison of serum vit A and vit A intake levels between asthmatic and healthy groups 12 case-control studies reported the serum vit A concentrations in asthmatic and healthy groups.
Our analysis with a random-effectmodel showed that the levels of serum vit A in asthmatic patients waslower than that in healthy controls (SMD = −2.479, 95% CI: FIGURE 1 Flow diagram of the process of selection of articles.

Two cohort studies reported the association between vit A intake in pregnancy and current asthma risk at age 7 years, and the pooled analysis showedthat relatively higher vit A intake in pregnancy was associated with anincreased risk of current asthma at 7 years of age (RR = 1.181, 95% CI:1.048, 1.331; I 2= 0, Tau2=0 )( Table 2 ;Figure 2D ). However, no signiﬁcant relationship was observed in children between vit A intake and asthma risk (OR = 1.010, 95% CI: 1.000, 1.020, 95% PI: .542, 1.480;I 2= 31.3%, Tau2= .0157) ( Table 2 ;Figure 2E ).Subgroup analyses For the comparison of serum vit A levels between asthmatic and healthy groups, we conducted a subgroup analysis by ethnicity,population or quality score.
In a subgroup analysis conducted byethnicity, we obtained signi ﬁcant result that the serum vit A concentration of asthmatic patients was lower than that of healthy controls in Asian populations (SMD = −3.891, 95% CI: −6.671, −1.112, 95% PI: −14.263, 6.481; I 2= 99.4%, Tau2= 15.9572). Similar results were observed in subgroups of children, children and adolescents orhigh-quality studies.However, patients with asthma had higher serumvit A levels than healthy controls in European populations (SMD =.615, 95% CI: .135, 1.095; I 2= 0, Tau2= 0) or adults (SMD = .925, 95% CI: .290, 1.559, 95% PI: −5.967, 7.816; I2= 60.2%, Tau2= 0.1893) (Table 3 ;Figure 3 ).No signi ﬁcant association in subgroup analysis was obtained between vit A intake and asthma risk in children ( Table 3 ; Figure 4 ).
Trial sequential analysis results In trial sequential analysis of the comparison of serum vit A levels between asthma and control groups, we estimated a required sample size of 13,863, and the cumulative Z-curve signi ﬁcantly crossed the conventional monitoring boundary and trial sequential monitoringboundary, but didn ’t cross the RIS boundary, further suggesting that the pooled result is less likely to be a random ﬁnding owing to a lack of power or multiple testing if bias could be ignored ( Figure 5 ). Publication bias and sensitivity analysis Given the limited number of studies included in the pooled analysis, we performed publication bias test and sensitivity analysisfor the pooled result which included 12 studies.Begg ’s test and Egger ’sTABLE 2 Meta-analysis in the association of vitamin A and asthma.

The funnel plot was shown in Supplementary Figure S1 (Supplementary Material S3 ). To assess whether the pooled results were affected by a single study, weconducted a sensitivity analysis by computing the pooled SMDs andthe corresponding 95% CIs after individual studies were omitted.Thesensitivity analysis indicated that Harik-Khan, Rubin or Al Senaidy ’s article may be the cause of high heterogeneity ( Supplementary Files S3 ).Discussion Asthma is characterized by chronic airway in ﬂammation and many features of asthma are caused by the release of pro- inﬂammatory mediators induced by oxidants ( Caramori and Papi, 2004 ).Oxidative stress leads to in ﬂammation and tissue damage of the respiratory system, which subsequently results in activation to theimmune system ( Bowler and Crapo, 2002 ).Antioxidants protect the respiratory tract by preventing oxidative DNA damage ( Marmsjö et al., 2009 ).
Thus, it has been reported that decreased antioxidant intake due to dietary changes leads to attenuate antioxidant defenses inthe lung and increased susceptibility to airway in ﬂammation and asthma ( Lazarus et al., 2007 ;Marmsjö et al ., 2009 ). Vit A is an antioxidant, which may play a major role in the respiratory tractthrough physiological quenching of singlet oxygen and inhibition offree radical chain reaction ( Harik-Khan et al., 2004 ;Wagner et al., 2008 ).Epidemiological studies have investigated the relationship of dietary vit A intake to asthma, however, the association betweenasthma and vit A status isn ’t fully understood.Hence, the primary objective of present meta-analysis was to understand the relationship between vit A status and asthma and to clarify the effect of dietary vit A intake on asthma.
Vit A is primarily stored in the liver, which closely regulates the circulating retinol levels, and serum retinol levels do not decline untilthe liver is almost depleted ( Timoneda et al., 2018 ). Serum vit Abiomarker concentrations re ﬂect the combined effect of dietary intake, bioavailability and metabolism.Our pooled analysis showed thatserum vit A concentrations were lower in patients with asthmathan in healthy controls.The triggers of asthma can result in therecruitment and activation of airway in ﬂammatory cells, produce more oxygen-derived free radicals, and lead to oxidative damage(Wood et al., 2003 ).Increased systemic free radical production is a characteristic of chronic airway in ﬂammation ( Vural et al., 2005 ).Retinoic acid is an active metabolite of vit A, which can in ﬂuence the maintenance, development, differentiation of lung epithelial cells,thereby reducing eosinophilic airway in ﬂammation ( Gray et al., 2001 ).
Airway in ﬂammation leads to an increase in lipid peroxides, providing cogent evidence that cell membrane damage may induce celldysfunction and lead to exacerbation of airway obstruction ( Al Senaidy, 2009 ). Therefore, we speculate that the free radical accumulation is associated with defective mobilization of stored retinol.The decrease of vit A levels in patients with asthma may be caused by increased utilization of this antioxidant in the presence ofexcess free radicals.However, no signi ﬁcant association was shown between serum vit A concentration and asthma risk in our study.Consequently, it is unclear whether low vit A level is either a maincause related to the pathogenesis of asthmatic condition, or asecondary event caused by the in ﬂammatory process of asthma.Few human studies, to our knowledge, have assessed the risk of child asthma in relation to pregnancy intake of vit A.
Many aspects of maternal-fetal transfer of retinoic acid and carotenoid, theirmetabolism in developing tissues, and the control of homeostasisin the case of excessive maternal dietary vit A intake are still poorlyknown ( Parr et al., 2018 ). Through retinoic acid, vit A is known to regulate the function of immune cells ( Hammerschmidt et al., 2008 ).For example, a signi ﬁcant body of evidence shows that retinoic acid potently regulates T cell activity, but may be either pro- or anti- inﬂammatory depending on conditions ( Takeuchi et al., 2013 ;Rampal et al., 2016 ).
It has been reported in animal studies that vit A de ﬁciency decreased the development of experimental asthma, indicating that vitAd e ﬁciency might skew towards Th1 cell-mediated responses and away from Th2 cell-mediated responses that induces asthma FIGURE 2 Forest plot of vit A and asthma (A)comparison of serum vit A levels between asthma and control groups; (B)comparison of vit A intake levels between asthma and control groups; (C)association between serum vit A levels and asthma risk; (D)association between vit A intake in pregnancy and current asthma at age 7 years; (E)association between vit A intake and asthma risk in children.

10.3389/fphar.2023.1100002 (Cantorna et al., 1995 ;Schuster et al., 2008 ). Nevertheless, human studies showed that vit A supplementation in pregnancy increasedTh1 cell-mediated responses and skewed away from Th2 cell-mediated responses, suggesting that the skewed in utero milieu can decrease the risk of asthma in children ( Holgate, 2004 ;Cox et al., 2006 ).Our analysis of cohort studies showed that relatively higher vit A intake during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk ofasthma in children at age 7 years.As the two cohort studies included inthe pooled analysis were from Norway and Denmark, we attribute theassociation in our study to the high retinol content of Norwegian codliver oil and the traditional diet rich in vit A ( Parr et al., 2018 ).We speculated that an increased intake of vit A during pregnancy, based on a diet naturally high in vit A, placed women at risk of vit A excess, thus increasing susceptibility to asthma in children.
Subgroup analysis revealed that in Asian populations, the serum vit A concentration in patients with asthma was lower than that inhealthy controls, while an opposite result was obtained in Europeanpopulations. The disparity of results for different ethnicity might beexplained by genetic variance, culture and dietary habits,socioeconomic status, healthcare system, and so forth ( Kodama et al., 2017 ).A recent study showed that genetic polymorphisms may be contributing to the vit A de ﬁciency status differences between ethnic groups ( Suzuki et al., 2021 ).The data suggests a need for more studies outside Asia (e.g., America, Europe) todetect differences, given that eight of the twelve studies were inAsia.Furthermore, in adults, serum vit A levels were higher in asthmatics than in healthy controls.A plausible explanation for theﬁnding is the effect of obesity ( Bishopp et al., 2017 ).
We found that the asthma groups had a higher mean BMI than the healthy control groups in original articles. Obesity affects numerous metabolic pathways, including vit A, although the exact nature of its effectshas not been determined ( Hijazi et al., 2000 ).Previous studies have reported that serum vit A levels of obese mice increased, and withweight loss, the serum vit A levels returned to the normal range(Trasino and Gudas, 2015 ).It is reported that obese individuals have higher levels of systemic oxidative stress, and hypertrophic adiposetissue produces proin ﬂammatory cytokines and adipokines, leading to metabolic in ﬂammation ( Ford et al., 2004 ;Urushidate et al., 2010 ).Obesity is a risk factor for asthma, but the de ﬁnite interaction between obesity and asthma is still not clear ( Hoffmann et al., 2007 ).Our study has several limitations.First, any dietary assessment method is subject to measurement error.
The use of both dietary recallinstrument and food frequency questionnaires to estimate dietary vitA intake provided relatively imprecise quantitative estimates. Second,assessing the dietary habits of vit A in young children seems dif ﬁcult, because they often eat little food and are unable to adequately report their vit intake.In practice, parents are unlikely to always be goodsurrogate reporters for their children ’s diet.Third, studies in humans are limited by potential toxic effects and the lack of viable biomarkersto assess appropriate or subtoxic status.Thus, no randomized FIGURE 3 Forest plot of subgroup analysis of comparison for serum vit A levels between asthma and control groups.(A)Subgrouped by ethnicity; (B)subgrouped by population; (C)subgrouped by quality score.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09Hu et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1100002 FIGURE 4 Forest plot of subgroup analysis of association between vit A intake and asthma risk in children.

Conclusion In conclusion, our meta-analysis con ﬁrms that serum vit A levels are lower in patients with asthma than in healthy controls,particularly in Asian and non-adult subpopulations. Relativelyhigher vit A intake during pregnancy is associated with anincreased risk of asthma at age 7 years.There is no signi ﬁcant correlation between vit A intake an d asthma risk in children, nor between serum vit A levels and asthma risk.Our analysis also suggests that the interaction of vit A and asthma may depend onage, ethnicity, or other factors, or be obscured in heterogeneouspopulations.Therefore, more stud ies are needed to further explore the association of vit A and asthma.Data availability statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary Material , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.Author contributions FH and LL conceived the study and were involved in the study design.JH administrated the study.
