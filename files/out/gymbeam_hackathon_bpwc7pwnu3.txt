REVIEW Vitamin B-12 and Perinatal Health1–3 Julia L Finkelstein,4,5* Alexander J Layden,4and Patrick J Stover4 4Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY; and5St.John ’s Research Institute, St.John ’s National Academy of Health Sciences, Bangalore, India ABSTRACT Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency (<148 pmol/L) is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including developmental anomalies, spontaneous abortions, preeclampsia, and low birth weight (<2500 g).The importance of adequate vitamin B-12 status periconceptionally andduring pregnancy cannot be overemphasized, given its fundamental rol e in neural myelination, brain devel opment, and growth.Infants born to vitamin B-12-deficient women may be at increased risk of neural tube closure defects, and maternal vitamin B-12 insufficiency (<200 pmol/L)can impair infant growth, psychomotor function, and brain development, which may be irreversible.However, the underlying causalmechanisms are unknown.
This review was conducted to examine the evidence that links maternal vitamin B-12 status and perinatal outcomes.Despite the high prevalence of vitamin B-12 deficiency and associated risk of pregnancy complications, few prospective studies and, to our knowledge, only 1 randomized trial have examined the effects of vitamin B-12 supplementation during pregnancy. The role of vitamin B-12 in the etiology of adverse perinatal outcomes needs to be elucidated to inform public health interventions.Adv Nutr 2015;6:552 –63.
Keywords: vitamin B-12, cobalamin, one-carbon metabolism, pregnancy, child health Introduction Vitamin B-12 VitaminB-12isawater-soluble B vitamin requiredasa cofactorfor only 2 enzymes in human physiology: methionine synthase (MTR) 6which generates and uses methylcobalamin and functions in the cytosol to remethylate homocysteine to methi-onine, and L-methyl-malonyl-coenzyme A mutase, which uses 59-deoxyadenosylcobalamin as a cofactor and functions in mitochondria to catabolize branched-chain and odd-chainFAs. MTR function is critical in folate-mediated one-carbonmetabolism (FOCM), including DNA synthesis andchromatinmethylation through the production of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the universal methyl donor required for methylation reactions throughout the human body.As such, vitamin B-12 is required for erythropoiesis, and the classic presentationof vitamin B-12 deficiency is hematologic: megaloblastic anemia (1).
Its classic deficiency syndrome is pernicious anemia,a malabsorption disorder inwhich autoimmune destruction ofgastricparietal cellsleadstoa lackofintrinsicfactor(IF) synthe- sis and secretion, a vitamin B-12-binding protein required for efficient active transport of vitamin B-12 across the intestinalepithelium. However, vitamin B-12 deficiency also leads toneurologic manifestations, even in the absence of hematologicsymptoms, which may be irreversible (2).Vitamin B-12 is synthesized exclusively by microorganisms and is obtained in the diet through consumption of animalsource foods, including meat and dairy.Several studies have noted low vitamin B-12 status in resource-limited settings, par- ticularly in populations with low dietary intake of animal pro-ducts (3, 4).In these settings, inadequate vitamin B-12 intakemay be exacerbated by gastrointestinal infections and subse-quent impaired vitamin B-12 absorption.
Medications such asproton pump inhibitors and histamine receptor antagonistscan also reduce gastric acid production and can decrease vita-min B-12 release from food sources and subsequent absorption (5). Previous studies have noted that use of acid blockers was associated with lower serum vitamin B-12 concentrations (6, 7).Pathogenesis and mechanisms This review focuses on vitamin B-12 and its function inFOCM through MTR.Vitamin B-12 is also involved in the ca-tabolism of odd-chain FAs, branched-chain amino acids, and 1The authors reported no funding received for this study.2Author disclosures: JL Finkelstein, AJ Layden, and PJ Stover, no conflicts of interest.3Supplemental Tables 1–4 are available from the "Online Supporting Material" link in the online posting of the article and from the same link in the online table of contents athttp://advances.nutrition.org.* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

How-ever, evidence is limited that this reaction contributes to thepathogenesis of vitamin B-12 deficiency. The MTR-catalyzed remethylation of homocysteine to methionine is a 2-step reaction that depends on both folateand vitamin B-12 (9).First, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-THF) donates the N-5 methyl group to cobalamin, regenerating the unsubstituted tetrahydrofolate (THF) cofactor and methylcobalamin (10).Subsequently, cobalamin donatesthe methyl group to homocysteine, converting it to methio-nine (11).Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency presents direct and indirect consequences for the cell.Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency decreases MTR activity, directly affecting capacity for methionine syn-thesis and AdoMet availability for cellular methylation reac-tions, and accumulation of unmetabolized homocysteine in cells and blood and may be pathogenic (12).
AdoMet is a uni- versal methyl donor for nearly 100 cellular reactions andbiological processes, including chromatin remodeling, genetranscription, protein localization, and neurotransmitter syn-thesis (13). Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency also indirectly disrupts other pathways within FOCM resulting from inability to me-tabolize 5-methyl-THF; this results in its accumulation in cellsat the expense of other folate cofactor forms, a metabolic state known as the methyl-THF trap.Derivatives of folate other than 5-methyl-THF, including 10-formyl-THF and 5,10-meth-ylene-THF are required for synthesis of purines and thymidy-late, respectively; thymidylat e synthesis is the rate-limiting deoxyribonucleotide in DNA synthesis (9).5,10-Methylene-THF is reduced to 5-methyl-THF by methylenetetrahdryofo-late reductase (MTHFR) in a reaction that is essentiallyirreversible under physiologic conditions.
In the absence of vitamin B-12, cellular folate pools become enriched as5-methyl-THF, acting as a functional folate de ﬁciency that impairs de novo purine and thymidylate biosynthesis (9, 14). Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency and its impact on FOCM result in metabolic impairments: homocysteine accumulation due tofailure to remethylate homocysteine to methionine, impairedmethionine and AdoMet biosynthesis, and accumulation of5-methyl-THF, leading to impaired purine and thymidylatesynthesis ( Figure 1 ).Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency is associated with biomarkers of genomic instability.Global DNA hypomethylation and de- creased purine and pyrimidine synthesis impair genomic sta- bility, causing chromosomal breaks and aberrations (15).
Astudy in Turkey noted that DNA damage was increased in vi-tamin B-12-de ﬁcient (vitamin B-12: <200 pg/mL) children and their mothers; however, intramuscular cobalamin injec-tions significantly decreased DNA damage in leukocytes ofvitamin B-12-deficient children 9 d after treatment ( P< 0.001) (16). Vitamin B-12 deficiency is associated with retar- dation of neural myelination in some studies (17 –19).Impair- ment of FOCM by maternal deficiency of vitamin B-12, folate,other one-carbon donors, or genetic polymorphisms mayhave serious consequences for early neurologic development,although the underlying mechanisms are unknown.Cobalamin uptake is a multistep process that involves a series of transporters and binding factors that complex withthe nutrient to facilitate its absorption and transport in circu- lation.On ingestion, cobalamin is liberated from protein in food and binds to salivary R binder in the stomach.
VitaminB-12 dissociates from haptocorrin and binds to IF in the duo-denum. Parietal cells in the stomach secrete both hydrochloricacid and the vitamin B-12-binding protein IF, and low IF con-centrations impair vitamin B-12 absorption.Insuf ﬁcient IF is caused by pernicious anemia, an autoimmune disease, whichtypically presents as megaloblastic anemia (20 –22).IF-bound vitamin B-12 is absorbed primarily in the ileum by the cubulin FIGURE 1 Vitamin B-12 in 1-carbon metabolism.Vitamin B-12 deficiency prevents remethylation of homocysteine to methionine; results in an accumulation of 5-methyl-THF, or “folate trap, ”decreasing the THF pool for synthesis of 10-f ormyl-THF; and impairs subsequent purine and thymidylate synthesis.MTHFD1, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTR, methionine synthase; tHcy, total homocysteine; THF, tetrahydrofolate.Vitamin B-12 and perinatal health 553 receptor.
Vitamin B-12 dissociates from IF in endothelial cells and enters portal circulation bound to transcobalamin (TC). Although most vitamin B-12 is bound to haptocorrin, TC- bound vitamin B-12 is delivered to the liver and other tissueswhere it is taken up by a TC receptor protein (23 –25).The physiologic role of haptocorrin in circulation remains unclear,although haptocorrin may act as a scavenger protein to removeinactive vitamin B-12 analogs from circulation (26, 27).Maternal vitamin B-12 concentrations during pregnancy are thought to be closely associated with fetal (28, 29) and early infant (30, 31) vitamin B-12 status.Vitamin B-12 is trans- ported by haptocorrinand TC; >70% ofvitamin B-12 transportacross the placenta is facilitated by TC, whereas the remainder isbound by haptocorrin (32).
Little is known about the pathwayof vitamin B-12 transport from the maternal to the fetal cir-cuits, but both vitamin B-12 carrier proteins are producedby the placenta and bind to vitamin B-12 in fetal circulation.Further, the placenta can regulate fetal B-12 uptake by ad- justing its rate of TC synthesis (33, 34). Impaired TC synthesis can also lead to vitamin B-12 deficiency in the neonate (33).Vitamin B-12 biomarkers There are 4 major biomarkers of cobalamin status: total serumor plasma vitamin B-12, methylmalonic acid, total homocyste-ine (tHcy), and holotranscobalamin.Assessment of cobalaminstatus can be classi ﬁed as 1) circulating biomarkers: vitamin B-12 and holotranscobalamin; 2) functional biomarkers: MMA and tHcy; and 3) other indicators, such as megaloblastic or perni- cious anemia (or historically, the Schilling test of vitamin B-12absorption via radioisotopes, which is no longer used).Circulating biomarkers.
Total vitamin B-12 is the most widely used indicator of cobalamin status. Holotranscobalamin is theportion of circulating cobalamin (10 –30%) that binds to TC for cellular uptake (35).As a result, holotranscobalamin is of-ten referred to as active vitamin B-12.Holotranscobalaminwas proposed as an optimal biomarker of early vitamin B-12deficiency >20 y ago.Data suggest that, although total vitaminB-12 decreases during pregnancy (36, 37), holotranscobala- min concentrations remain relatively constant (36, 37); how- ever, the role of holotranscobalamin in the etiology of perinataloutcomes has not been established.Data are limited regardingthe utility of holotranscobalamin for cobalamin assessmentcompared with other biomarkers (38), and holotranscobalaminis not widely used in population-based assessments of vitaminB-12 status (23).Functional biomarkers.MMA and tHcy are functional indi- cators of vitamin B-12 status.
Homocysteine re ﬂects the central role of vitamin B-12 as a cofactor for MTR function, which gen- erates and uses methylcobalamin and remethylates homocyste- ine to methionine in the cytosol. Homocysteine is commonlyused as a biomarker of vitamin B-12 insuf ﬁciency, although it is not speci ﬁc to vitamin B-12 and is in ﬂuenced by a host of other factors both within (e.g., folate) and outside (e.g., renal disease)FOCM.MMA has been identi ﬁed as an important functional in- dicator of cobalamin de ﬁciency, because vitamin B-12 is a requiredcofactor for isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA.A variety of vitamin B-12 biomarkers are used in clinical and population-based studies, including vitamin B-12, MMA,tHcy, and holotranscobalamin.The different biomarkersand cutoffs used to de ﬁne vitamin B-12 status pose challenges when interpreting ﬁndings across studies.
The 2011 NHANES roundtable series on vitamin B-12 and folate biomarkers sta-tus suggested the inclusion of both circulating and functionalbiomarkers (vitamin B-12 and MMA) in population-based studies (39 –42). Recent data provide support for the potential use of cB12, a combination of all 4 vitamin B-12 biomarkers(vitamin B-12, MMA, homocystei ne, and holotranscobalamin), as an indicator of vitamin B-12 status (43), although it has notyet been validated in clinical or field settings.In this review, the following vitamin B-12 biomarkers were included: total vitamin B-12, MMA, tHcy, and holotransco-balamin.Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency was de ﬁned as total serum or plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations <148 pmol/L and vi- tamin B-12 insufficiency was defined as vitamin B-12 concen-trations <200 pmol/L, unless otherwise noted.Nutrient –nutrient interactions Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency may co-occur with other nutrient deﬁciencies, including other B vitamins involved in FOCM.
These micronutrients, such as folate, ribo ﬂavin, and choline, may also in ﬂuence functional vitamin B-12 biomarkers and risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Folate.Folate and vitamin B-12 are interrelated through the shared MTR pathway in FOCM (9, 44, 45).Folate is also nega- tively correlated with tHcy, because 5-methyl-THF is the indi- rect donor of a methyl group to homocysteine (46, 47).Aprimary function of FOCM is DNA synthesis; vitamin B-12 orfolate de ﬁciency leads to impaired DNA synthesis and erythro- poiesis and causes megaloblastic anemia (48).Although it repre-sents a small percentage of anemia cases, megaloblastic anemia isa potential consequence of folate de ﬁciency (49, 50).In a study in Canada, 90% of patients with megaloblastic anemia presented with low folate (serum folate: <4.0 ng/mL) and vitamin B-12 (vi- tamin B-12: <100 pg/mL) status (51).
Other adverse perinataloutcomes are also common to vitamin B-12 and folate defi-ciencies, most notably neural tube closure defects (NTDs). Choline and B vitamins.Other nutrients, such as choline, vitamin B-6, and ribo ﬂavin, are involved in FOCM.Two pathways methylate homocysteine: vitamin B-12- and betaine-dependent pathways.Betaine methylates homocysteine tomethionine via the betaine:homocysteine methyltransferasepathway.Betaine (52) and choline (53) were inversely associ- ated with homocysteine concentrations in previous studies; choline oxidizes irreversibly to betaine, a direct methyl donorfor homocysteine.Choline and betaine insuf ﬁciency may also affect fetal neurulation.Higher maternal choline intake wasassociated with a lower odds of NTDs, although ﬁndings were not signi ﬁcant (OR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.04; P> 0.05) (54).riboflavin and vitamin B-6 are also required cofactors for 554 Finkelstein et al.folate derivative pathways.
Vitamin B-6 is required for conver- sion of THF to 5,10-methylene-THF, the folate derivative re- quired for thymidylate and purine synthesis (55, 56). Riboflavin is required for conversion of 5,10-methylene-THFto 5-methyl-THF for the MTHFR pathway (55).The complexity and interrelations of micronutrients in FOCM constrain the ability to ascertain the speci ﬁc effects of vitamin B-12 on the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.In addition, the genetic heterogeneity that affects the activ-ity of enzymes in FOCM, such as MTHFR, can modulate FOCM (57).A mathematical model of chemical kinetics of folate pathways in FOCM suggested that folate de ﬁciency has little effect on the rate of these metabolic reactions (58).Compensation between the different pathways of FOCMmay help to mitigate the effects of a speci ﬁcm e t h y ld o n o r deﬁciency.
Vitamin B-12 and perinatal health Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency is a major public health problem worldwide, although representative population-level data arelimited (59, 60). Although the prevalence of vitamin B-12deﬁciency in the United States is estimated to be relatively low (6%), the burden of vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency is higher in subpopulations across the life cycle (61).The burden of vita-min B-12 de ﬁciency is particularly high in resource-limited settings in Latin America ( ;40%) (62), Sub-Saharan Africa (70%) (63, 64), and South Asia (70 –80%) (65, 66).For exam- ple, in a randomized trial of vitamin B-12 supplementation inBangalore, India, 51% of pregnant women were vitamin B-12deficient (vitamin B-12: <150 pmol/L) and 42% had impairedvitamin B-12 status (vitamin B-12: <150 pmol/L; MMA:>0.26mmol/L) at their first prenatal visit (67).
Maternal vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency is associated with in- creased risk of common pregnancy complications, including spontaneous abortion, recurrent pregnancy loss, small-for-gestational age (SGA), low birth weight (LBW), intrauter-ine growth restriction (IUGR), and NTDs (44, 65, 68 –77). Infants born to vitamin B-12-deficient women are at increasedrisk of developmental abnormalities, growth failure, and ane-mia (18, 78).Vitamin B-12 insufficiency can impair infantgrowth, psychomotor function, and brain development, which may be irreversible (18, 78).The high prevalence of vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency and in- creasing evidence that low periconceptional vitamin B-12 status is a risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes have stimulated interest in mandatory food forti ﬁcation with vitamin B-12 (61).However, data are limited on the ef ﬁ- cacy of vitamin B-12 interventions on maternal and childhealth outcomes, and the potential mechanisms need to beelucidated.
The objective of this review was to examine the evidence that links maternal vitamin B-12 status and perinatal out- comes. We examined the evidence from observational studies and intervention trials on the role of vitamin B-12 in the eti-ology of pregnancy outcomes.We then discuss the potentialroles of other micronutrients in FOCM, research gaps, andimplications for the development of interventions to improvethe health of mothers and young children, with emphasis onresource-limited settings.Methods Search strategy and selection process We conducted a structured literature search with the use of MEDLINE elec- tronic databases.Relevant Medical Subject Heading terms were used to iden-tify published studies from June 24, 1999, to June 25, 2014.The Medical Subject Heading terms used are provided in Table 1 , and the search strategy is summarized in Figure 2 .
Initial inclusion criteria for this review were the availability of an abstract and inclusion of data on maternal vitamin B-12 status or intake and perinatal outcomes. The following biomarkers of maternal vitamin B-12 status were in- cluded in this review: serum and plasma total vitamin B-12, MMA, tHcy, andholotranscobalamin.Abstracts were searched, full-text articles were extractedand reviewed, and the following inclusion criteria were applied: 1) human studies, 2) pregnant women and infants, and 3) availability data on maternal vitamin B-12 status or intake and perinatal outcomes.All observationalcross-sectional, case-control, and co hort studies; and randomized trials; interventions; and quasi-randomiz e da n du n c o n t r o l l e dt r i a l st h a tm e t the above-mentioned selection criteria were included.Sources were re-trieved, collected, indexed, and assessed for vitamin B-12 and perinataloutcome data.
Additional sources were identified from bibliographies of published studies, manual searches of related articles in references, scien- tific meeting abstracts, white papers, and expert committee reports. An ad-ditional searchwas conducted to find review articles, whichwere examinedto cross-reference other relevant studies.A standardized data table was used to extract and summarize key information from studies.As part of this protocol, publication date, authors, study design, setting, population,definitions of exposures and outcomes, main findings, and study limita- tions were recorded.

Vitamin B-12 and perinatal health 555 Results Literature review The structured literature search resulted in 599 articles, whichwere reviewed for potential inclusion in this review. After 464studies were excluded, 135 studies were extracted for further review.After excluding 12 studies that did not meet inclusion criteria, 123 studies were included in this review.These in-cluded 122 observational studies and 1 randomized trial.The structured literature search is summarized in Figure 2 , and findings from these studies are summarized in detail inthe subsequent tables ( Supplemental Tables 1 –4).Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency and perinatal outcomes Several studies have reported signi ﬁcant associations between low maternal vitamin B-12 status and increased risk of ad-verse perinatal outcomes.
Maternal vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency was associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes (vita-min B-12:<150pmol/L) (79), early miscarriage(vitamin B-12:<180 pg/L) (75), and NTDs (vitamin B-12: <133 pg/mL) (44). Although some studies have used a cutoff of serum or plasma vitamin B-12 of <148 or 150 pmol/L, most studies used tertiles,quartiles, or deciles of vitamin B-12 concentrations, based onits distribution in the population.Lower maternal vitaminB-12 status has been associated with increased risk of NTDs(68 –72, 80), spontaneous abortions (73), early miscarriage (74), SGA (76), IUGR (77), and LBW (<2500 g) (77).Maternal anemia.The classic presentation of vitamin B-12 deﬁciency is megaloblastic anemia (81).However, evidence is limited for an association between maternal vitamin B-12status during pregnancy and risk of maternal anemia.
In a cross-sectional study in China, serum vitamin B-12 ( P< 0.012) and folate ( P< 0.010) concentrations were significantly lower in anemic (hemoglobin: <11.0 g/dL) pregnant women than in nonanemic women (82). Similarly, in a cross-sectional study in Brazil, pregnant women in the lowest serum vitaminB-12 quartile (vitamin B-12: <145 pmol/L) had significantlylower hemoglobin ( P< 0.05) and serum ferritin ( P< 0.05) concentrations than women in the upper 3 vitamin B-12 quar-tiles (83).However, in a cross-sectional study in Ethiopia, nodifferences were found in plasma vitamin B-12 concentrationsbetween anemic (hemoglobin: <11.5 g/dL) and nonanemic women (84), and a cross-sectional study in the United King- dom found that only 5.6% of women with low vitamin B-12status (vitamin B-12: <211 ng/L) had low hemoglobin(<10.5 g/dL) concentrations (85).Preeclampsia.
Findings regarding the associations be- tween maternal vitamin B-12 status and risk of preeclamp-sia have varied among vitamin B-12-related biomarkers. For example, in several studies, women with preeclampsia had signi ﬁcantly higher homocysteine concentrations than normotensive pregnant women; however, no signi ﬁcant dif- ferences were found in serum or plasma vitamin B-12 con-centrations between groups (86 –88).Among patients with severe preeclampsia in Greece (blood pressure: $170/110 mm Hg) and Turkey (blood pressure: $160/110 mm Hg), only homocysteine concentrations were significantly higher, compared with normotensive pregnant women ( P< 0.001 and P< 0.05, respectively) (86, 87).In addition, in a cohort FIGURE 2 Search strategy.A diagrammatic representation of the retrieval strategy used for identifying and selecting studies for inclusion in the finalanalysis.556 Finkelstein et al.
study in Netherlands, pregnant women with the lowest fo- late quintiles (plasma folate: #9.2 nmol/L) and the highest homocysteine quintiles (tHcy: $8.3mmol/L) had a 4-fold greater odds of preeclampsia than women with normalhomocysteine (tHcy: <8.3 mmol/L) and folate (folate: >9.2 nmol/L) status [adjusted OR (AOR): 4.27; 95% CI:1.21, 15.0; P= 0.02] (89). Gestational diabetes.The data on the associations between maternal vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency and gestational diabetes are limited and con ﬂicting.In a cohort study in India among 785 pregnant women, 43% were vitamin B-12 de ﬁcient (vitamin B-12: <150 pmol/L) and only 4% were folate deficient (folate:<7 pmol/L); maternal vitamin B-12 deficiency at 30 wk gesta-tion was associated with significantly increased risk of adiposityand insulin resistance during pregnancy (79).Further, the inci-dence of gestational diabetes in vitamin B-12-deficient womenincreased from the lowest to the highest tertiles of plasma folate (79).
In a study in Turkey, pregnant women with gestational di- abetes (blood glucose: >135 mg/dL; and a positive oral glucosetolerance test with 100 g glucose) had higher homocysteineconcentrations than pregnant women without gestational dia-betes(90).However,theassociationsbetweenmaternal vitaminB-12 status and gestational diabetes could not be ascertainedbecause vitamin B-12 deficiency was an exclusion criteria forthis study (90). A case-control study in Poland found no differ- ences in vitamin B-12, homocysteine, or folate concentrations between women with gestational diabetes (positive oral glucosetolerancetest with75gglucose) andwomenwithout gestationaldiabetes, although all participants received prenatal multivita-min supplements that contained vitamin B-12 (91).Fetal outcomes.Several studies have examined the associa- tions of maternal vitamin B-12 status and risk of adverse fetal outcomes, including spontaneous abortions.
In a study in France, maternal vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency (serum vitamin B-12: <180 pg/L )was associated with a 9-fold greater odds of early recurrent abortion ( $2 consecutive abortions with the same partner with <12 wk of amenorrhea), comparedwith replete vitamin B-12 status (OR: 9.5; 95% CI: 1.2, 75;P< 0.05) (75). In a study among Syrian women, higher ma- ternal vitamin B-12 concentrations were associated with lower odds of recurrent pregnancy loss (OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98, 0.99; P= 0.012) (92).In a study in the United Kingdom, higher maternal homocysteine concentrations were associ-ated with a 1.3 times greater odds of spontaneous abortion(OR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.61; P= 0.041), although no asso- ciations were noted with maternal vitamin B-12 status (93).Preterm birth.
Higher homocysteine concentrations have been associated with increased occurrence of preterm birth or lower gestational age at delivery in several studies, althoughmost studies have not assessed vitamin B-12 concentrations.For example, in a case-control study in China, hyperhomo-cysteinemia (tHcy: $12.4mM) was associated with 4-fold greater odds of preterm birth (<37 wk gestation; AOR: 3.6;95% CI: 1.3, 10.0; P< 0.05) (94). In a case-control study inNepal, higher tHcy concentrations were associated with lower gestational age at delivery ( P< 0.05) (95).Additional studies have noted associations between other vitamin B-12 bio- markers and gestational age at delivery, although findingsare conflicting.A study in Norway found that higher serumholohaptocorrin concentrations in cord blood were corre-lated with increased gestational age at delivery ( P= 0.026) (96).
In contrast, a case-control study in India found thatwomen with preterm delivery had significantly higher plasmavitamin B-12 concentrations at delivery than women with term deliveries ( P= 0.003) (96, 97). LBW.Lower maternal serum and cord blood vitamin B-12 concentrations have been associated with increased risk of ad-verse pregnancy outcomes in several studies, including LBW(<2500 g), SGA, and IUGR.For example, lower cord vitaminB-12 concentrations were associated with lower birth weight(P= 0.02) in a study in the United Kingdom (98).In a study in Bangalore, India, lower cord blood vitamin B-12 concentra- tions were reported in neonates with LBW (<2500 g) thanin neonates with normal birth weight (>3000 g) ( P= 0.022) (29).
Similarly, women with serum vitamin B-12 concentra-tions in the lowest tertile (median: 157 pg/mL) in the first tri-mester (10 –12 wk gestation) had a 6.2 times greater odds of having an IUGR delivery (OR: 6.22; 95% CI: 1.89, 20.47;P< 0.05) than women in the highest tertile (median: 304 pg/mL) ( P= 0.003) (99). Similarly, women with serum vita- min B-12 concentrations in the lowest tertile in the second(OR: 8.35; 95% CI: 2.85, 24.46; P< 0.001) or third (OR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.04, 7.12; P= 0.048) trimesters had signifi- cantly increased odds of IUGR, compared with women inthe highest tertile (99).
In a prospective analysis in the samecohort in Bangalore ( n= 1838), higher intake of prenatal folic acid supplements in combination with low vitamin B-12 in- take was associated with increased risk of SGA: women in the lowest tertile of vitamin B-12:folate intake ratio had a2.7 times greater odds of having a SGA delivery (AOR: 2.73;95% CI: 1.17, 6.37; P< 0.05), than women in the highest ter- tile (100). Findings were similar in analyses of serum vitaminB-12 and erythrocyte folate concentrations in a random sub-set ( n= 316) (100).These findings suggest that, in addition to deficiencies of vitamins B-12 and folate alone, unbalanced vitamin B-12 and folate intake or status may interact and increase risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (100, 101).
Higher tHcy concentrations were associated with signi ﬁ- cantly increased risk of LBW in a study in Netherlands (89).Similarly, in a study in Japan, maternal tHcy concentrationswere associated with signi ﬁcantly lower birth weight: each 0.1-mmol/L increase in maternal tHcy concentrations during the third trimester was associated with a 151-g lower infant birth weight ( P< 0.01) (102). In a study in Pakistan, maternal tHcy concentrations were significantly higher in IUGR casesthan in control cases ( P= 0.02) (103).
In the study in Nether- lands, maternal tHcy concentrations in the highest quintile(tHcy: $8.3mmol/L) were associated with a 1.7-fold greater odds of SGA (AOR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.43; P= 0.006); mater- nal tHcy in the highest quintile (homocysteine: $8.3mmol/L) Vitamin B-12 and perinatal health 557 in combination with plasma folate in the lowest quintile (#9.2 nmol/L) was associated with a 4-fold greater odds of SGA than women with normal tHcy (<8.3 mmol/L) and folate (>9.2 nmol/L) status (AOR: 4.04; 95% CI: 1.97, 8.28; P< 0.001) (89). NTDs.Several small case-control studies have reported an association between lower maternal vitamin B-12 concentra-tions and increased occurrence of NTDs (44, 68 –72, 104 –106).A case-control study in Egypt reported that low maternal vita-min B-12 status (plasma vitamin B-12: <200 ng/L) was associ- ated with a 2.7 times greater odds of having an NTD-affected pregnancy (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.42, 5.02; P< 0.05) (106).
In a similar study in China, low maternal serum vitamin B-12 con-centrations (<55 pmol/L) were associated with a 5-fold in-crease in the odds of NTDs (OR: 4.96; 95% CI: 1.94, 12.7;P< 0.05), after adjusting for maternal age, education, gravid- ity, and gestational age at delivery (105).In a case-control studyin Ontario, Canada,in the folic acid fortificationera, women in the lowest quartile of serum holotranscobalamin ( #55.3 pmol/L) had a 2.9 times greater odds of having an NTD-affectedpregnancy compared to women in the reference quartile(>121.0 pmol/L; OR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.2, 6.9; P< 0.05) (71). In case-control studies in the United States among motherswith or without NTD-affected pregnancies, lower maternalserum vitamin B-12 ( #372 pg/mL) and higher tHcy ( $6.7 mmol/L) concentrations were associated with a 2.4 and 2.6 times greater odds of NTDs, respectively; no differences were found in maternal folate concentrations between cases and con-trols (107).
Further, in the case-control study in the UnitedStates, the combination of low vitamin B-12 ( #372 pg/mL) and high tHcy ( $6.7mmol/L) concentrations was associated with a 4.8 times greater odds of NTDs (OR: 4.8; 95% CI: 1.6,14.8; P< 0.05) (107). Similarly, in a ca se-control study in Ireland among women with either NTD-affected pregnancies or a his- tory of NTD-affected pregnancies, low maternal vitamin B-12 (<250 ng/L) concentrations predicted a 2.5 –3.0 times greater odds of NTDs, independent of folate status (72).Few studieshave examined the associations between maternal vitaminB-12 status and specific types of NTDs, such as spina bifida oranencephaly.In a case-control study in Netherlands, womenwith vitamin B-12 deficiency (<185 pmol/L) had a 3.5 timesgreater odds of spina bifida than women with replete vitamin B-12 status (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 8.9; P< 0.05) (108).
Most stud- ies on maternal vitamin B-12 status and NTD occurrence to datehave used a case-control design, in which maternal vitamin B-12status and NTDs were assessed concurrently at delivery. Thelack of assessment of maternal vitamin B-12 status periconcep-tionally or prospectively during pregnancy constrains the inter-pretation of findings and establishment of a causal temporalrelation.Other congenital defects.Several case-control studies in Netherlands have noted that AdoMet, S-adenosyl- L-homo- cysteine, and tHcy concentrations were significantly higherin women who had neonates with congenital heart defects(CHDs) than newborns without CHDs (109 –112).One case-control study in Netherlands also found that womenwith low serum vitamin B-12 concentrations ( #185 pmol/L) had a 4 times greater odds of having a neonate with nonsyn- dromic orofacial cleft (OR: 4.4; 95% CI: 1.1, 18.2; P< 0.05) than women with replete vitamin B-12 status (113).
The stud-ies that investigated the associations of maternal vitamin B-12status and CHDs were case-control studies conducted at thesame medical facility in Netherlands, which constrains thegeneralizability of findings. Infant vitamin B-12 status.Several cross-sectional studies have examined the associations between maternal and neona- tal vitamin B-12 status at delivery and have found strong cor-relations for serum vitamin B-12 and related biomarkers.Forexample, in a cross-sectional study in Germany, maternal andcord blood holotranscobalamin concentrations were signi ﬁ- cantly correlated ( r= 0.68, P< 0.001) (28).Several cohort studies have noted associations between maternal serumand neonatal (or cord blood) vitamin B-12 concentrations, and some studies found that neonatal vitamin B-12 concen- trations were significantly higher than maternal concentra-tions.
For example, in a cohort study in Bangalore, India,cord blood vitamin B-12 concentrations were 27% higherthan maternal vitamin B-12 concentrations (29). Similar re-sults were reported in a study in Pakistan, where cord serumvitamin B-12 concentrations were 2-fold greater than mater-nal vitamin B-12 concentrations ( P< 0.001) (103).In the ﬁrst randomized trial of vitamin B-12 supplementa- tion (50 mg/d vitamin B-12 and iron-folic acid, compared to iron-folic acid alone) in 366 pregnant women in Bangalore,India, 51% of women were vitamin B-12 deficient (<150 pmol/L)and 42% had impaired vitamin B-12 status (vitamin B-12:<150 pmol/L; MMA: >0.26 mmol/L) at their first prenatal visit (67).Infants born to vitamin B-12-deficient motherswere 1.6 times more likely to be vitamin B-12 deficient (<150 pmol/L) ( P< 0.01) at 6 wk of age compared to infants born to vitamin B-12 replete mothers (31).
Daily prenatal vi-tamin B-12 supplementation with iron-folic acid improvedmaternal vitamin B-12 status ( P< 0.01), reduced the risk of IUGR ( P= 0.10), and increased breast milk ( P< 0.01) and in- fant plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations ( P< 0.01) at 6 wk of age, compared to iron-folic acid alone. However, the substan-tial increases in breast milk and infant vitamin B-12 status re- verted after cessation of daily vitamin B-12 supplementation.Infant cognitive development.Few studies to date have ex- amined the role of vitamin B-12 in cognitive development ininfants.In a study in the United States, inadequate vitamin B-12 intake (<2.0 mg/d) was correlated with poorer infant men- tal development ( b=21.6,P< 0.05) (114).
In a study in the United Kingdom, every 2-fold increase in maternal vitamin B-12 intake (log 2) was associated with a 2-point increase in infant intelligence quotient (Weschler Intelligence Scalefor Children) ( P< 0.001), although this was not significant (0.7-u, P= 0.06), after adjusting for potential confounders (115). The association between maternal vitamin B-12 statusand cognitive development in children later in life was alsonoted in several studies.558 Finkelstein et al.Other infant outcomes.Additional infant outcomes as- sessed in relation to maternal vitamin B-12 status included ex-cessive crying and insulin resistance.
Maternal serum vitaminB-12 concentrations in the lowest 4 quintiles (vitamin B-12:#425 pg/mL) were associated with a 2.6 –3.9 times greater risk of excessive crying in infants, compared tothe highest quintile (>425 pg/mL); in women with high de-pressive and anxiety symptoms, low vitamin B-12 status(<251 pg/mL) was associate d with a 12-fold greater odds of having an infant with excessive crying (OR: 12.2; 95%CI: 1.54, 97.0; P< 0.05) than women with high vitamin B-12 status (>425 pg/mL) (116). Low maternal plasma vi- tamin B-12 concentrations (<150 pmol/L) were also asso- ciated with increased risk of infant insulin resistance ( P= 0.03) with the use of the homeostatic model assessmentof insulin resistance (117).Infant insulin resistance washighest among mothers with the lowest vitamin B-12(<114 pmol/L) and highest erythrocyte folate (>1144 nmol/L)concentrations, although the nutrient interactions were notsignificant ( P= 0.70).
Several studies have also noted an asso- ciation between low maternal vitamin B-12 status during early pregnancyand insulin resistanceinchildren later inlife,includ-ing large prospective studies in Nepal (<148 pmol/L) (118)and India (<150 pmol/L) (79). Discussion Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency is common during pregnancy and is associated with adverse outcomes for the mother and in-fant.Recent observational studies suggest that maternal vi-tamin B-12 de ﬁciency is associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications, such as NTDs (65, 68 –72, 80), spontaneous abortions (73 –75), preeclampsia (65), and LBW (76, 77, 99).However, most studies were case-controlor cross-sectional in design, which constrains the inter- pretability of findings and causal inference.Evidence is lim- ited or conflicting to support the role of maternal vitaminB-12 status in other perinatal outcomes.
Only 1 randomizedtrial was conducted to date to examine the effects of vitaminB-12 supplementation during pregnancy, and it was not de-signed to examine the effects of vitamin B-12 on pregnancyoutcomes (67). The high prevalence of vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency and in- creasing evidence that low periconceptional vitamin B-12 sta- tus may be a risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes havestimulated interest in mandatory food forti ﬁcation with vita- min B-12 (61).However, data are lacking on the ef ﬁcacy of vitamin B-12 interventions on speci ﬁc maternal and child health outcomes, and the potential mechanisms need to beelucidated.Findings from observational studies indicate that imbal- ance in micronutrients involved in FOCM may present dele- terious health consequences for the mother and infant.
Thereis also concern regarding the use of folic acid interventions inthe context of vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency (i.e., folic acid may have adverse effects in individuals with low vitamin B-12 sta-tus) (100, 101). Recent ﬁndings suggest that, in addition to vi- tamin B-12 and folate de ﬁciencies alone, unbalanced vitaminB-12 and folate intake or status may be associated with adverse health outcomes (100).Research gaps and future directions Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency is an important public health issue globally, and poses a severe threat to maternal and child health.Study design.The observational studies to date have sev- eral limitations, which warrant caution when interpretingﬁndings.Most studies were case-control or cross-sectional in design, which are subject to reverse causation and limit the es- t a b l i s h m e n to fc a u s a lt e m p o r a lr e l a t i o n s .T h e r ei sal a c ko fp r o -spective studies to examine the role of vitamin B-12 in theetiology of perinatal outcomes.
Data are limited on maternal vi-tamin B-12 status periconceptio nally when it is critical for risk of birth defects. In addition, few studies have measured mater-nal vitamin B-12 status prospectively throughout the course ofpregnancy.Vitamin B-12 biomarkers need to be examined early in pregnancy and at multiple times during gestation and post- partum periods.In the ﬁrst randomized trial ofprenatal vitamin B-12 supplementation to date in Bangalore, India (67), dailyprenatal vitamin B-12 supplementationwith iron-folic acid sig-niﬁcantly improved maternal and infant vitamin B-12 status, compared to iron-folic acid alone.However the substantialimprovements in vitamin B-12 status reverted after cessationof daily vitamin B-12 supplementation, suggesting that longer-term public health approaches are needed.Vitamin B-12 biomarkers.
The variety of vitamin B-12 bio- markers used in different studies (including serum andplasma vitamin B-12, MMA, tHcy, and holotranscobalamin),laboratory assessment methods, and cutoffs for vitamin B-12deﬁciency and insuf ﬁciency pose challenges when interpret- ingﬁndings across different studies. Further research is needed to establish appropriate biomarkers of vitamin B-12 status, particularly in pregnancy and in the context of ﬁeld and resource-limited settings.Additional nutrients in FOCM.One-carbon metabolism is inﬂuenced by a variety of nutrients, which interact and can compensate for one another when there is a de ﬁciency of a single nutrient.The role of additional nutrients in FOCM, such as folate and choline, need to be examined in the context of vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency and perinatal outcomes.
In partic- ular, maternal folate status needs to be considered in prospec-tive analyses, because it may in ﬂuence vitamin B-12 status and is an independent risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes,such as NTDs. In addition to adjusting for maternal folate sta-tus in analyses, the interactions between these nutrients in theetiology of adverse perinatal outcomes need to be elucidated.Additional outcomes.Infants are considered a high-risk group for vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency, based on the low vitamin B-12 content in breast milk.However, data are relatively lim-ited on vitamin B-12 breast milk concentrations or relatedbiomarkers and associations with health outcomes in earlychildhood.In particular, few studies have examined the role Vitamin B-12 and perinatal health 559 of maternal or breast milk vitamin B-12 concentrations in early infant cognition, immune function, and psychomotor development.
Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin B-12 (mechanisms, biomarkers, cutoffs) inthe etiology of functional outcomes. Translational research.Studies in animal and cell models provide valuable insight into the causal mechanisms andpathways of vitamin B-12 in the etiology of adverse perinataloutcomes.Findings from human and animal studies have identi ﬁed a potential role of vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency in the development of adverse perinatal outcomes, such as NTDs.However, there is limited prospective and causal data in hu-man populations.The biological mechanisms of vitamin B-12-related disorders need to be determined experimentallyin relevant animal and cell models to inform translational re-search in at-risk human populations.Conclusions Maternal vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency is a major public health problem and is associated with increased risk of adverse per-inatal outcomes.
The importance of adequate vitamin B-12status, particularly during pregnancy and early childhood,cannot be overemphasized in light of its role in neural myeli-nation, brain development, and fetal and child growth. Fur- ther research is urgently needed to elucidate the role of vitamin B-12 in the etiology of perinatal outcomes and to in-form public health approaches in at-risk populations.Acknowledgments All authors read and approved the ﬁnal manuscript.References 1.Aaron S, Kumar S, Vijayan J, Jacob J, Alexander M, Gnanamuthu C.Clinical and laboratory features and response to treatment in patientspresenting with vitamin B12 deficiency-related neurological syn-dromes.Neurol India 2005;53:55 –8.2.Lindenbaum J, Healton EB, Savage DG, Brust JC, Garrett TJ, Podell ER, Marcell PD, Stabler SP , Allen RH.Neuropsychiatric disorderscaused by cobalamin deficiency in the absence of anemia or macrocy- tosis.N Engl J Med 1988;318:1720 –8.3.Allen LH.Causes of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency.
