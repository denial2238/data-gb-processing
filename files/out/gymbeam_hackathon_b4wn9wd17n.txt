Creatine monohydrate's (Cr) ergogenic potential is well established; however few studie s have directly examined the ef fects of Cr supplementation on recovery after damage. We examined the effects of Cr supplementation on muscle proteins and force recovery after eccentrically-induce d muscle damage in healthy individuals.Methods: Fourteen untrained male participants (22.1 ± 2.3 yrs, 173 ± 7.7 cm, 76.2 ± 9.3 kg) were randomly separated into 2 supplement groups: i) Cr and carbohydrate (Cr-CHO; n = 7); or ii) carbohydrate (CHO; n = 7).Participants consumed their supplement for a period of 5 days prior to, and 14 days following a resist ance exercise session.Partic ipants performed 4 sets of 10 eccentric-only repetitions at 120% of their ma ximum concentric 1-RM on the leg press, leg extension and leg flexion exercise machine.Plasma creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity were assessed as relevant blood markers of muscle damage.
Muscle strength was examined by voluntary isokinetic knee extensio n using a Cybex dynamometer. Data were analyzed using repeated measures AN OVA with an alpha of 0.05.Results: The Cr-supplemented group had significantly greater isokinetic (10% higher) and isometric (21% higher) knee extension strength during recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage.Furthermore, plasma CK activity was significantly lower (by an average of 84%) after 48 hrs (P < 0.01), 72 hrs (P < 0.001), 96 hrs (P < 0.0001), and 7 days (P < 0.001) recovery in the Cr- supplemented group.
Conclusion: The major finding of this investigation wa s a significant improvement in the rate of recovery of knee extensor muscle function after Cr supplementation following injury.Published: 2 June 2009 Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2009, 6:13 doi:10.1186/1550-2783-6-13Received: 27 February 2009 Accepted: 2 June 2009 This article is available from: http://www.jissn.com /content/6/1/13 © 2009 Cooke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2009, 6:13 http://www.jissn.com/content/6/1/13 Page 2 of 11 (page number not for citation purposes)Background Exercise-induced skeletal muscle injury is well understood as the product of unfamiliar or strenuous physical activity,and eccentric (lengthening) contractions under high loadsare primarily responsible [1,2].
Eccentric exercise leads tothe disruption of the normal muscle ultrastructure andalters sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) func- tion which results in an increase in intracellular calcium and subsequent activation of degradative pathways [3].The trauma created by this type of exercise initiates a myr-iad of events that lead to reductions in muscle force,increased soreness, and impaired muscle function [1,2].Therefore, strategies that may reduce the negative effects of eccentric exercise and/or promote the regenerative processes would benefit athletes and others that performstrenuous/unaccustomed physical activity. One dietary supplement that may reduce the severity of exercise-induced muscle damage and/or promote recov-ery is creatine monohydrate (Cr) (n [aminoiminome- thyl]-N-methylglycine).
Although well-over 200 studies have examined Cr's ergogenic potential in the last 20 years[4], few studies [5-8] have directly examined the effects ofCr supplementation on indicators of muscle damage andrecovery after damage. Rawson and colleagues [7] supple-mented male subjects with Cr for 5 days prior to 50 max- imal eccentric contractions.The study showed that maximal isometric force of the elbow flexors, and serumcreatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)activity, in response to eccentric exercise were not signifi-cantly different between the Cr-supplemented and controlgroups during the 5 days following exercise.Therefore, it was suggested that Cr supplementation does not reduce indirect markers of muscle damage or enhance recoveryfrom high-force eccentric exercise.Similarly, Warren et al.[8] demonstrated that recovery of mouse anterior cruralmuscle strength after damage (induced by 150 eccentriccontractions) was unaffected following 2-weeks of Cr sup- plementation.
Following 3 minutes recovery, there was no effect on isometric strength or on torque loss at any eccen-tric or concentric angular velocity. However, a number oflimitations exist with this study.Firstly, researchers wereonly interested in how increased muscle Cr influencedpeak strength loss and not the recovery of strength per se after injury.Therefore, the 3 min recovery period may not be long enough to see any beneficial effect of Cr supple- mentation on muscle strength loss.Secondly, Cr supple-mentation may have attenuated other markers of muscledamage such as blood concentrations of myocellular pro-teins.However, since injury assessment was only musclefunction based, these were not measured.The effect of Cr supplementation upon inflammatory and muscle soreness markers has also been examined follow-ing prolonged running [5].Experienced marathon run-ners were supplemented (4 doses of 5 g of Cr) for 5 days prior to a 30 km race.
Blood samples were collected pre- race, and 24 hours following the end of the test, to meas-ure for CK, LDH, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and TNFalpha(TNF-α). Athletes from the control group presented an increase in all muscle soreness markers, indicating a highlevel of cell injury and inflammation, while Cr supple- mentation significantly attenuated these increases, with the exception of CK.However, while this Cr supplementa-tion protocol may be an effective strategy in maintainingmuscle integrity during and after intense prolonged aero-bic exercise, it may not be sufficient to protect musclefibres from more damaging exercises, such as those shown by Rawson et al.[7].Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to supple- ment a group of healthy participants with either Cr or aplacebo prior to, and in the days after a single bout ofeccentric exercise.
The extent of, and recovery from, dam-age was evaluated by the following established, indirect markers of exercise-induced muscle damage; knee exten- sion/flexion force development (MVC), and plasma CKand LDH activity [9,10]. We hypothesized that supple-mentation with Cr would reduce muscle damage andrestore muscle strength earlier after a single bout of eccen-tric exercise.Methods Participants Fourteen healthy untrained males (22.1 ± 2.3 yrs, 173 ±7.7 cm, 76.2 ± 9.3 kg) volunteered for this study.Descrip-tive characteristics of the participants are presented in table 1.To meet the criteria the men (a) were non-smok- ers; (b) had not participated in resistance-training, or anyform of structured exercise, for at least six months; (c) hadnot ingested any ergogenic supplement for a 24-weekperiod prior to the start of supplementation; and (d)agreed not to ingest any other nutritional supplements, or non-prescription drugs that may affect muscle re-growth during the study.
In addition, participants agreed torefrain from using any remedy (i.e. massage, ultrasoundetc.) for muscle soreness other than consumption of thesupplement given; and agreed not to participate in anyform of physical activity 2 weeks prior to supplementa- Table 1: Participant ba seline characteristics Characteristics CHO Cr-CHO P-value Age (yrs) 21.7 ± 3 22.6 ± 2 0.52 Weight (kg) 74.4 ± 7 77.9 ± 12 0.51 Leg Press 1 RM (kg) 85.9 ± 16 83.62 ± 15 0.80 Leg Extension 1 RM (kg) 40 ± 10 36.4 ± 10 0.49 Leg Flexion 1 RM (kg) Extension 26.8 ± 16 34.1 ± 13 0.35 Data are means ± standard deviations of mean.SI unit conversion factor: 1 kg = 2.2 lbs Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2009, 6:13 http://www.jissn.com/content/6/1/13 Page 3 of 11 (page number not for citation purposes)tion and during the 2 week recovery period.All partici- pants were informed verbally, as well as in writing, as to the objectives of the experiments, together with the poten-tial associated risks.
All participants signed an informedconsent document approved by the Human Research Eth-ics Committee of Victoria University of Australia. All pro-cedures conformed to National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for the ethical conduct of research involving humans.Experimental design All procedures were completed at the Human Perform-ance Laboratory at Victoria University.Two weeks prior to baseline testing, participants underwent 1 repetition max- imum (RM) strength assessments on the dominant limband a familiarisation session of the equipment that wouldbe utilized to assess muscle performance.The dominantlimb would undergo the damage protocol, while the con-tralateral limb served as the control.Participants were ran-domised in a double-blind placebo-controlled fashion into 2 groups: carbohydrate-only (CHO) (n = 7) or Cr-car- bohydrate (Cr-CHO) (n = 7), and issued with their sup-plement and dosing instructions.
On day 1, participantsarrived at the laboratory in the morning and underwentbaseline performance assessments and blood sampling.Participant's then underwent catherization of the forearm vein and performed an exercise session designed to cause damage to the knee extensor and flexor muscles. Bloodsamples were taken at 30 minutes, 1, 2, and 4 hours fol-lowing the bout of exercise.The participants wereinstructed to return to the laboratory 24 hours post-exer-cise, and again at the same time on day 2, 3, 4, 7, 10 and 14 for further blood sampling and all muscle performance assessments.All participants arrived at all assessment daysin (8 hour) fasted state.Dietary Supplementation The supplements were provided to the participants in identical, unmarked, sealed containers, supplied by AST Sports Science, Golden, Colorado USA.
For five days priorto the bout of exercise, the Cr-CHO group consumed asupplement (1.5 g -1 kg of body weight-1 day) that pro- vided a loading dose of Cr (0.3 g-1 kg of body weight-1 day). This provided a 70 kg participant with approxi-mately 21 g of Cr -1 day, with the remainder (84 g in this case) being CHO in the form of glucose.The participants were shown how to consume this dose in several smallerservings each day, i.e., 20–30 g of supplement mixed inwater and consumed immediately, once with breakfast,lunch, in the afternoon and after the evening meal.Thisprocedure has been reported to consistently increase mus- cle Cr concentrations [11].The CHO group consumed an equivalent per body weight dose of CHO (glucose) only.After the bout of exercise, participants were instructed totake one serving of a supplement (0.5 g -1 kg of bodyweight-1 day) that provided the Cr-CHO group with a maintenance dose of Cr (0.1 g-1 kg of body weight-1 day) during the 14-day recovery period.
Again, the remainderof the supplement was CHO in the form of glucose, andthe CHO groups ingested an equivalent per body weightdose of glucose only. Participants' diets were monitored and assessed as previ- ously described by this laboratory [12].In brief, partici-pants were shown how to record their dietary habits indiaries provided.During the final recovery week each par-ticipant submitted a 7-day written dietary recall (consist-ing of 5 week days and two weekend days) for the calculation of macronutrient and energy intake.Mean energy intake is expressed in kcal -1 kg of body weight per day; protein, fat and carbohydrate are expressed in g-1 kg of body weight per day.The participants were asked toreport any adverse events from the supplements in thenutrition diaries provided.No adverse events werereported by the participants.
Resistance exercise protocol Two weeks prior to the session, unilateral (dominantlimb) concentric 1 RM assessments were completed foreach participant using a procedure prescribed by theNational Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) [13]. An NSCA certified Strength and Conditioning Spe- cialist supervised all lifts and the damage protocol com-pleted by participants.The resistance exercise session wasdesigned to cause muscle damage.Using a modified ver-sion of a procedure previously described [14,15], theworkout consisted of three exercises; 1) leg press; 2) leg extension and 3) leg curl (Universal, Cedar Rapids, IA, USA) utilizing 120% of the participants' predeterminedconcentric 1 RM for each exercise.The participant wasrequired to lower the weight by themselves through theentire range of motion (ROM) at a predetermined cadence(4 seconds) given verbally.This constituted 1 repetition.
The participant completed 40 eccentric-only repetitions (4 sets × 10 with 3 minutes rest between sets) of each exer-cise in this manner. All participants were verbally encour-aged during each set to maintain the required loweringspeed.However, if the participant was not able to do thisin the later stage of the set, (as a result of fatigue), then abrief (5–15 second) pause between the last 2–3 repeti- tions was permitted.Although the workout was extremely difficult, all participants were able to complete the proto-col as outlined.Performance assessments Muscle performance before and after the bout of eccentric exercise was measured by voluntary isokinetic knee flex- ion and isokinetic/isometric knee extension of each legusing Cybex™ Testing and Rehabilitation System (CybexInternational Inc.Ronkonkoma, New York).
A protocol Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2009, 6:13 http://www.jissn.com/content/6/1/13 Page 4 of 11 (page number not for citation purposes)similar to that described by [16] was utilized. Measure- ments of isokinetic knee extension and flexion torque were performed at 60°/s (1.57 rad.s-1) velocity torque in one continuous kicking motion.ROM for knee extensionand flexion was from 90° to 0° and 0° to 120°, respec-tively (0° = full knee extension).Maximal isometricstrength was determined in three contractions at a knee angle of 60° and of 5-s duration.There was a 20 second rest between each isometric contraction, and a 60 secondrest between the isokinetic and isometric force measure-ments.Strength values obtained from Cybex tests were expressed as percentage of pre-exercise values and normalized to contralateral controls.
Previous research has shown this tobe a successful means of reporting muscle strength andperformance data, and removes any improvement in mus-cle performance recovery of the injured limb due to famil-iarization of the test [16,17]. Test, retest reliability trialswere completed on the Cybex dynamometer prior to this study and provided a coefficient of variance (CV) of less than 5% for each parameter measured.Blood Sampling Approximately 10 mls of venous blood was sampled fromthe antecubital fossa vein via catheterisation before and after the bout of eccentric exercise on day 1.Venipuncture technique was used to draw further blood samples at 2, 3,4, 7, 10 and 14-days after the resistance exercise session.The blood was immediately placed into an ethylediniami-netetra-acetic acid (EDTA) tube, inverted and rolled, thentransferred into eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C.
Plasma was removed and aliq- uoted into labelled eppendorf tubes and stored at -80°Cfor subsequent analysis of CK and LDH activity. For CK,plasma samples were analysed by a 2-step enzymaticcolorimetric process using a VITROS 750 Chemistry Sys-tem according to the method of [18].For LDH activity, plasma samples were analysed using a single step enzy- matic rate process requiring readings on a UV-visible spec-trophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-1700, SUZHOUInstrumental manufacturing Co.Ltd, China) according tothe method of [19].Statistical Analysis Participant characteristics are reported as means ± SD.Allother values are reported as means ± SE.Muscle perform-ance data was expression as a percentage of baseline val-ues.Muscle performance variables were analyzed using 2× 7 (group × day [Day 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 10 and 14) repeatedmeasures ANOVA to effectively assess the changes in mus- cle function/strength following supplementation post exercise.
Blood variables were analyzed using 2 × 14(group × day [baseline, 30 min, 60 min 2 hours, 4 hours,day 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 10 and 14) repeated measures ANOVA toeffectively assess the changes in markers of muscle dam- age following supplementation post exercise. LSD pair- wise comparisons were used to analyze any significantgroup × time interaction effects.Baseline variables, totalwork performed during the resistance exercise session anddietary intake between groups was analyzed using anindependent students' t-test.An alpha level of 0.05 was adopted throughout to prevent any Type I statistical errors.Results Participant Characteristics At baseline there were no differences in the age, body weight or strength level (1 RM) between the two groups (Table 1).Resistance Exercise Session (Total Work) No differences in total work performed during the resist-ance exercise session were observed between the twogroups (Table 2).
Dietary Analysis One-week dietary analysis (excluding supplementation)revealed no differences in energy, protein, fat and carbo-hydrate intake between groups throughout the study(Table 3). Muscle Strength and Performance Assessment Isometric Knee Extension Strength Pre-exercise absolute values for isometric knee extension strength were 234 ± 24 Nm and 210 ± 11 Nm for the CHOand Cr-CHO groups, respectively.No differences were detected.A significant main effect for time was observed in muscle strength following the resistance exercise ses-sion indicating reductions in strength (expressed as a per-centage of pre-exercise strength) in both groups persistedfor 14 days (P < 0.05).
A significant main effect for group(P < 0.01) and group × time interaction (P < 0.05) was observed in muscle strength following the resistance exer- cise session, suggesting that although reductions instrength were also observed in the Cr-CHO supple-mented, these reductions were a far smaller % thanobserved in the CHO group (Figure 1). Indeed subsequentpost-hoc analysis revealed significantly higher musclestrength at 24 hours (P < 0.05), 48 hours (P < 0.01), 72 Table 2: Resistance Exercise Session (Total Work) Characteristics CHO Cr-CHO P-value Leg Press 1 RM (kg) 103 ± 16 100 ± 11 0.81 Leg Extension 1 RM (kg) 48 ± 9 44 ± 5 0.44 Leg Flexion 1 RM (kg) Extension 32 ± 9 41 ± 6 0.36 Data are means ± standard deviations of mean.

Isokinetic Knee Strength Pre-exercise absolute values for isokinetic knee extensionstrength were 206 ± 13 Nm and 197 ± 10 Nm for the CHOand Cr-CHO supplemented groups, respectively. No dif-ferences were detected.A significant group × time interac-tion was observed in isokinetic knee extension strengthduring recovery (P < 0.05), with subsequent post-hoc analysis revealing that the Cr-CHO supplemented group had higher isokinetic knee extension peak torque com-pared to the CHO group at 48 hours post resistance exer-cise (P < 0.05, Figure 2.).Pre-exercise absolute values for isokinetic knee flexion strength were 135 ± 9 Nm and 123 ± 9 Nm for the CHO and Cr-CHO groups, respectively.
No statistically signifi-cant interactions were observed across groups (Figure 3).Plasma Enzyme Activity Pre-exercise CK activity was 176.1 ± 59.2 IU·1-1 and 196.4 ± 37.9 IU·1-1 (mean ± SEM) in the CHO and Cr-CHO groups, respectively. No significant differences weredetected.Figure 4.illustrates a significant main effect fortime (P < 0.0001) for CK activity following the resistanceexercise session.Subsequent post-hoc analysis showed CK activity to be significantly elevated above baseline at 48 hours (P < 0.0001), 72 hours (P < 0.0001) and 96 hours(P < 0.0001) post-exercise.A trend towards significancewas observed at day 7 (P = 0.074).A significant maineffect for group (P < 0.0001) and group × time (P < 0.001)interaction was observed in plasma CK activity, indicating that participant CK response was not similar, in terms of magnitude, at all recovery time points following the resist-ance exercise session (Figure 4).
Indeed, subsequent post-hoc analysis revealed significantly lower plasma CK activ-ity at days 2 (P < 0.01), 3 (P < 0.001), 4 (P < 0.0001), and7 (P < 0.001) post-exercise in the Cr-CHO compared toCHO group, after which CK activity in the plasma had returned to baseline in both groups (Figure 4). Pre-exercise LDH activity was 156.6 ± 37.1 IU·1 -1 and 148.0 ± 31.3 IU·1-1 (mean ± SEM) in the CHO and Cr- CHO supplemented group, respectively.No significantdifferences were detected.Similar to CK, a significant main effect for time (P < 0.0001) was observed for LDH activity following the resistance exercise session, with sub-sequent post-hoc analysis showing LDH activity to be sig-Table 3: Dietary Analyses CHO Cr-CHO P-value Energy (kcal·kg·d-1) 32.7 ± 3.9 33.3 ± 4.6 0.80 Protein (g·kg-1 d·-1) 0.92 ± 0.09 0.91 ± 0.13 0.77 Fat (g·kg-1·d-1) 0.92 ± 0.18 1.08 ± 0.18 0.12 Carbohydrate (g·kg-1·d-1) 4.33 ± 1.00 4.93 ± 0.81 0.24 Data are means ± standard deviations of mean.

However,the increases in LDH were far lower than for CK, such thatonly a trend towards a main effect for group was observed (P = 0.093), although this still indicates that plasma LDH activity was generally lower in the Cr-CHO supplementedgroup compared to the CHO group (Figure 5).
Discussion The primary objective of this study was to determine whether consumption of Cr prior to, and following exer- cise-induced damage, improves force recovery and mark-ers of muscle damage in healthy individuals. Followingrepeated eccentric exercises, isokinetic knee extension andflexion and isometric knee extension peak torque was sig-nificantly reduced, and remained significantly lower thanpre-exercise values, for approximately 4 days or longer.Importantly, isometric (21% higher) and isokinetic (10% higher) knee extension strength were both significantlygreater during recovery with consumption of a Cr-CHOsupplement compared to a supplement with CHO alone.The observed decrements in muscle strength were in accordance with previous studies, with Brown and col- leagues [14] showing similar reductions, although othersdemonstrated less reductions in strength [7,17].
Such var-ying responses in the magnitude of strength loss followingeccentric exercises are possibly due to the different muscle groups used (i.e. elbow flexors of the forearm vs.kneeextensor/flexors muscles groups) and/or the protocol uti-lized to induce muscle damage [7,17,20].It should also benoted that muscle strength was expressed as a percentage of pre-exercise strength values and normalised to contral- ateral (undamaged) controls.This is a common methodof analysing loss of muscle strength following exercise-induced damage [7,14,17], which therefore not only nor-malises data by accounting for any improvements duringthe recovery period as a result of familiarisation, but more importantly reduces the inter-individual variability in muscle strength between participants.Extensive literature has examined the effects of Cr supple- mentation on exercise performance, in particular highintensity exercise [21].
However, only a few studies haveinvestigated the efficacy of Cr supplementation on muscle recovery after injury [5-8]. In 2001 and 2007, Rawson and colleagues examined the effects of Cr supplementation onmuscle damage and recovery following 2 different exerciseintensities; a high-force, eccentric exercise [7] and a lowforce, hypoxic resistance exercise challenge [6].In the firststudy, male participants were supplemented with Cr for 5 days prior to 50 maximal eccentric contractions.Results showed no significant differences in maximal isometricforce of the elbow flexors, or serum CK or LDH activity,between the Cr-supplemented and dextrose control groupEffect of CHO and Cr-CHO on plasma CK a ctivity after exercise-i nduced muscle damage Figure 4 Effect of CHO and Cr-CHO on plasma CK ac tivity after exercise-i nduced muscle damage .Data (mean ± SE) rep- resents plasma CK activity (IU/l) taken during the 14 days recovery.† represents (p < 0.05) difference between groups.

In the second study, male participants were supplemented with Cr for 5 daysprior to, and 5 days following a squat exercise protocol (5sets of 15–20 repetitions at 50% of 1 repetition maximum[1 RM]).Similar to the first study, oral Cr supplementa- tion had no effect on reducing the extent of muscle dam- age and/or enhancing the recovery following theresistance exercise challenge [6].
In the current study however, the Cr-supplemented group exhibited an enhanced rate of muscle function recoverycompared to the placebo group; as evident by the higher muscle strength values for both the isometric and isoki- netic knee extension during the recovery period followingexercise-induced muscle damage. Such differing observa-tions could be in part due to the length of supplementa-tion period and/or post-exercise supplementation.In thefirst study by Rawson and colleagues (2001), participants were only supplemented for 5 days prior to the exercise- induced damage protocol; with no continuation of sup-plementation following the exercise bout [7].Willoughbyand Rosene [22] have suggested that by continuing Crsupplementation after a resistance exercise bout (initial stimulus), Cr may act as a co-regulator, or direct manipu-lator of gene transcription of amino acid pools, thusenhancing myofibrillar protein synthesis during therecovery period post-injury.Indeed Olsen et al.
(2006) supported such a suggestion by recently demonstrating for the first time in human skeletal muscle fibres that Crsupplementation amplifies the training-induced increasein satellite cell number and myonuclei concentration[23], and thus potentially, muscle regeneration. Although Cr supplementation was continued following the exercise bout in the second study by Rawson and col- leagues [6], it is possible that the resistance exercise ses-sion, which was designed to be hypoxic in nature, asopposed to high force, eccentric exercise, may not haveelicited enough muscle damage to unmask the anaboliceffects of Cr supplementation [24].Taken together, it is evident from the current study that Cr supplementation prior to, and during recovery from, an eccentric exerciseresistance training session, provides faster recovery instrength.
It is not uncommon for resistance trained ath-Effect of CHO and Cr-CHO on plasma LDH a ctivity after exercise-i nduced muscle damage Figure 5 Effect of CHO and Cr-CHO on plasma LDH ac tivity after exercise-i nduced muscle damage .

Such an increase in strength output during recovery would presumably allowfor a higher training load during subsequent training ses-sions in the days following the initial exercise bout.Indeed, this may be one of the explanations behindgreater mass and strength gains observed in resistance trained participants ingesting Cr-containing supplements [25]. While the majority of studies have examined the role of Cr during the recovery period post exercise [25-27]; anumber of studies have suggested a possible beneficial role during exercise [28-30].The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2+pump derives its ATP preferentially from PCr via the CK reaction [28].Local rephosphorylation of ADP bythe CK-PCr system maintains a low ADP/ATP ratio withinthe vicinity of the SR Ca 2+ pump and ensures optimal Ca2+ pump function (i.e.removal of calcium from the cyto-plasm) [31].
However, when rates of Ca 2+ transport are high (as seen in muscle damage), there is a potential for an increase in [ADP], thus creating a microenvironment(i.e. high [ADP]/[ATP] ratio) that is unfavourable forATPase function, and as a consequence, SR Ca 2+ pump function may be diminished [28,31].Furthermore, adecrease in [PCr] below 5 mM, which is characteristic of this increased ATPase activity; reduces local ATP regenera- tion potential of the CK/PCr system [29,30].Thus, by sup-plementing with Cr prior to, but also following exercise-induced muscle damage, PCr concentrations within themuscle will be increased, and therefore could theoreticallyimprove the intracellular Ca 2+ handling ability of the mus- cle by enhancing the CK/PCr system and increase local rephosphorylation of ADP to ATP, thus maintaining ahigh [ATP]/[ADP] within the vicinity of SR Ca 2+-ATPase pump during intense, eccentric exercise.However, thisconcept requires further investigation.
Myofibrillar enzymes CK and LDH are widely accepted as markers of muscle damage after prolonged exercise [32-34]. Due to the different clearance rates of these enzymes,plasma CK and LDH were measured at 1, 2, 3, 4 hours fol-lowing exercise and on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 14 post-exercise.Plasma CK and LDH activity significantlyincreased during the days post-exercise, and remained ele- vated above baseline until day 10 post-exercise.The time course and magnitude of increased CK and LDH inplasma following the resistance exercise session was inaccordance with previous work [7,35], with maximum CKand LDH activity occurring approximately 72 to 96 hoursafter the resistance exercise.The delay in maximal eleva- tion of CK and LDH activity is most likely caused by the increasing membrane permeability due to secondary ordelayed onset damage as a result of increasing Ca 2+ leak- age into the muscle [36].
Additionally, the differences inthe magnitude of CK and LDH present in plasma follow- ing eccentric exercise (as seen in Figures 4 and 5) is possi- bly due to the larger molecular weight of LDH comparedto CK and hence a decreased ability to diffuse from themuscle cell following injury [37]. In the current study, plasma CK activity was significantly lower (~84% on average) at day 2, 3, 4, and 7 in the Cr- CHO supplemented group compared to the CHO groupfollowing exercise-induced muscle damage, with a similartrend (~12% lower) in LDH activity.Less leakage of mus-cle enzymes from the muscle may be indicative of lessdamage to the muscle, which may be due to improved Ca 2+ buffering capacity of the muscle (i.e.the rate of Ca2+ removal from the muscle cytoplasm) and thus less Ca2+ accumulation within the cell and subsequent proteolytic activation.
In summary, the major finding of this investigation was significantly higher muscle strength after Cr supplementa- tion during recovery from a muscle damaging exercise ses- sion. While this may be due in part to a faster musclegrowth during the recovery period, significantly lowerplasma creatine kinase activity in the days after injury isindicative of less muscle damage.Perspective It is clear that a limitation to the current study is that the exact mechanisms by which Cr exerts its effects were notexamined, and thus, further research is needed.However,it is evident from other studies that Cr is perhaps working via two possible mechanisms in the current study.Firstly, Cr supplementation prior to eccentric-induced damagemay be enhancing the calcium buffering capacity of themuscle by fuelling the SR Ca 2+-ATPase pump, thereby decreasing intracellular calcium concentrations and acti-vation of degradative pathways such as calpain.
Thus, a reduction in calcium-activated proteases will minimise additional damage to the sarcolemma, but more impor-tantly, further influxes of calcium into the muscle. Sec-ondly, Cr supplementation post-exercise may enhanceone or more of the key phases involved in the regenerativeresponse to exercise-induced damage, such as increasingprotein synthesis, reducing protein degradation, and thus, creating an environment that facilitates enhanced satellite proliferation and hence formation of new muscle fibres.This combination is likely to allow a higher training vol-ume to be maintained during subsequent exercise ses-sions during resistance training.Competing interests This study was funded by AST Sports Science Pty Ltd(USA) through an unrestricted research grant to VictoriaUniversity.
