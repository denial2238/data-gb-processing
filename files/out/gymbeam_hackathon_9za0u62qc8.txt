In this study, we aimed to clarify the epidemiologyof these de ﬁciencies and ef ﬁciently predict them using machine-learning models from patient characteristics and routine blood test results that can be obtained within one hour. Methods: We reviewed 497 consecutive patients, who are deemed to be at imminent risk of seriously harming themselves or others, over a period of 2 years in a single psychiatrictertiary-care center.Machine-learning models (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression,support vector machine, and random forest) were trained to predict each de ﬁciency from age, sex, and 29 routine blood test results gathered in the period from September 2015 toDecember 2016.The models were validated using a dataset collected from January 2017through August 2017.Results: We found that 112 (22.5%), 80 (16.1%), and 72 (14.5%) patients had vitamin B 1, vitamin B 12, and folate (vitamin B 9)d eﬁciency, respectively.
Further, the machine-learning models were well generalized to predict de ﬁciency in the future unseen data, especially using random forest; areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the validation dataset (i.e., the dataset not used for training the models) were 0.716, 0.599,and 0.796, respectively. The Gini importance of these vitamins provided further evidenceof a relationship between these vitamins and the complete blood count, while alsoindicating a hitherto rarely considered, potential association between these vitamins andalkaline phosphatase (ALP) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).

The prediction method may expedite riskstrati ﬁcation and clinical decision-making regarding whether replacement therapy should be prescribed.Further research includes validating its external generalizability in otherclinical situations and clarify whether interventions based on this method could improve patient care and cost-effectiveness.Keywords: machine learning, random forest classi ﬁer, vitamin B de ﬁciency, folic acid, early diagnosis, decision support techniques or decision making INTRODUCTION Vitamin B de ﬁciency is common worldwide and may lead to psychiatric symptoms ( 1–4).
For example, meta-analyses have shown that patients with schizophrenia or ﬁrst-episode psychosis have lower folate (vitamin B 9) levels than their healthy counterparts ( 4,5). Moreover, vitamin therapy can effectively alleviate symptoms in a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia(3,6–8).However, the epidemiology of vitamin B de ﬁciency in patients with active mental sy mptoms requiring immediate hospitalization has rarely been examined.In a psychiatric emergency, psychiatrists should promptly distinguish treatable patients with altered mental status due to a physical disease from patients with an authentic mental disorder (International Statistical Classi ﬁcation of Diseases and Related Health Problems-10, ICD-10 code: F2-9).However, vitamindeﬁciency testing is very costly (around 60 dollars for each measurement of vitamin B 1(vitB 1), vitamin B 12(vitB 12), or folate in the U.S.; 15 –25 dollars for each test in Japan) and usually requires at least two days.
Therefore, an ef ﬁcient, cost- effective method of predicting vitamin B de ﬁciency is needed. Although several studies have applied machine-learning to the prediction of diagnosis or treatment outcomes ( 9–11), nostudy using machine-learning has focused on vitamin B deﬁciencies.We herein explore whether vitB 1,v i t B 12,a n d folate de ﬁciencies can be predicted using a machine-learning classi ﬁer from patient characteristics and routine blood test results obtained within one hour based on a large cohort ofpatients requiring urgent psychiatric hospitalization.METHODS Medical Chart Review We reviewed consecutive patients admitted to the Department of Neuropsychiatry at Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center,one of the biggest psychiatric tertiary-care centers in Japan, between September 2015 and August 2017 under the urgent involuntary hospitalization law, which requires the immediatepsychiatric hospitalization of patients at imminent risk of seriously harming themselves or others.
The necessity ofhospitalization was judged by designated mental health specialists. There were no exclusion criteria.The patient characteristics, ICD-10 code s, and laboratory data were gathered retrospectively.GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT |Tamune et al.Vitamin De ﬁciency Predicted by Machine-Learning Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org February 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 1029 2 Since the reference ranges for vitB 1,v i t B 12, and folate are 70 – 180 nmol/L (30 –77 ng/mL), 180 –914 ng/L, and >4.0 mg/L, respectively ( 12), a de ﬁciency of the nutrients was de ﬁned as < 3 0n g / m L ,< 1 8 0n g / L ,a n d< 4 .0 mg/L, respectively, unless otherwise stated.The odds ratios of each de ﬁciency in each ICD-10 code were calculated assuming binomial distribution.Classi ﬁers and Statistics We compared four types of standard machine-learning classi ﬁers: k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, support vector machine,and random forest.
Each type of classi ﬁer was trained to predict the de ﬁciency of each substance from age, sex, and 29 routine blood variables (described with values in the Results section). For developing the models, any missing values were replaced using the mean.The classi ﬁers were trained using the dataset populated in the period from September 2015 to December 2016 (the “Training set”).First, except for logistic regression, we optimized the hyperparameters of the classi ﬁer by selecting the best combination of hyperparameters that maximized the "5-foldcross validation" accuracy, among many combinations within appropriate ranges.The cross-validation accuracy was computed as follows: in one session, the classi ﬁers were trained using 80% of the training set and evaluated on the withheld 20% of the trainingset.This session was performed ﬁve times so that every data would be withheld once.The accuracies were ﬁnally averaged across sessions to yield the cross-validation accuracy.
By incorporating this process, the classi ﬁers were generalized to unseen data (Graphical method is shown in Figure 1 ). Using the optimized hyperparameters, the classi ﬁers were then validated using data collected from January 2017 through August2017 (the “Validation set ”).We report the classi ﬁcation performance on the validation set in the Results section unless otherwise stated.We quanti ﬁed the sensitivity, speci ﬁcity, and accuracy (deﬁned as the average of the sensitivity and the speci ﬁcity on the optimal operating point) using receiver operatingcharacteristic curves (ROCs).We also quanti ﬁed the 95%conﬁdence interval of the area under the ROCs (AUCs) and accuracy using 1000-times bootstrapping.When investigating the Gini importance and the partial dependency ( 13), we retrained the classi ﬁers using all datasets.All data analyses were performed using Python (2.7.10) with theScikit-learn package (0.19.0) and R (3.4.2) with the edarf package (1.1.1) and pROC package (1.15.3).
Robustness Veri ﬁcation We veri ﬁed the robustness of the prediction performances by three independent approaches. First, we compared the following two prediction performances: random forest classi ﬁers trained and validated using the dataset from the F2 population, andrandom forest classi ﬁers trained and validated using the dataset from the non-F2 population.Second, we compared the prediction performances of several random forest classi ﬁers trained and validated using the dataset where different cut-off values were used to de ﬁne the vitamin deﬁciency.We chose other two cut-off values for each vitamin based on previous reports ( 14–16), as well as pre-de ﬁned cut-off values (see also Medical Chart Review section).Third, we trained and validated other random forest classi ﬁers where the dataset was split in a different way.
Here, the training set consisted of data between 31 January 2016 and August 2017 and the validation set consisted of data between September 2015 and 31January 2016, so that the sample sizes of the training and validationsets were equal to those in the original split. Subsampling Analysis We also examined the relationship between the dataset size and thegeneralization performance ( 17).In this analysis, we trained the random forest classi ﬁers using X% of the training set (X = 30, 35, 40,…, 95, and 100), and validated them using the validation set.The hyperparameters were identical to those used in the previous section.To remove sampling bias, this procedure was repeated 100 times for each value of X, where the training dataset was sampled FIGURE 1 | Graphical illustration of method of machine-learning.Tamune et al.Vitamin De ﬁciency Predicted by Machine-Learning Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org February 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 1029 3 randomly for each repetition.
This results in obtaining 100 AUC scores for each X and for each vitamin. We plotted the AUC scores(averaged across the 100 repetition) versus X for each vitamin,then the curve was ﬁt with the following saturating function using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm implemented as “curve_ ﬁt” function in the Scipy package (0.19.0).Y= a*X X+b+0 :5 (1) where Yis the AUC score, and aandbare the parameters to ﬁt.Note that Y!a+0.5 as X!∞andY= 0.5 as X=0 .Ethical Considerations Informed consent was obtained from participants using an optout form on the website.The study protocol wasapproved by the Research Ethics Committee, Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center (Approval number: 28- 8).The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki andthe STROBE statement.RESULTS Eligible Patients During the 2-year study period, 497 consecutive patients (496 were Asian) were enrolled.The mean age (standard deviation,SD) was 42.3 (±15.4) years, and 228 patients (45.9%) werewomen.

Vitamin De ﬁciency Predicted by Machine-Learning Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org February 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 1029 4 Prediction via Machine-Learning Using Routine Blood Test Results Machine-learning classi ﬁers were trained to predict the deﬁciency of each substance from patient characteristics and routine blood test results. The classi ﬁers were trained using the dataset gathered in the period from September 2015 to December2016 (the “Training set, ”n = 373), which was then validated from January 2017 through August 2017 (the “Validation set, ”n= 124).By splitting the whole dataset in this way, the ratio of thetraining and validation sample size was 3:1, a commonly usedratio in machine-learning analyses.AUCs for the validation set for each classi ﬁer are summarized inTable 4 .Although the performance of the classi ﬁers was similar except for the k-nearest neighbors, random forest yielded the highest AUC on average.
Therefore, we focused on randomforest in the following analysis. The AUCs of the random forest classi ﬁers were 0.716, 0.599, and 0.796, for vitB 1,v i t B 12, and folate, respectively ( Figures 2D –F and Table 4 ).With some operative points on the ROC, thesensitivity, speci ﬁcity, and accuracy for the validation set were calculated ( Table 4 .S e ea l s o Supplementary Table 4 for training set and Supplementary Table 5 for different operating points).The 95% con ﬁdence interval (CI) of the AUC and accuracy was quanti ﬁed using 1000-times bootstrapping.For random forest classi ﬁers, the 95% CI of each value did not include 0.5, except for the AUC of vitB 12.Figure 3 shows the Gini importance ( A–C)a n dp a r t i a l dependency plots ( D–F) for the eight most important variables for each substance.
The results provided further evidence of arelationship between the vitamin B levels and complete bloodcount while also indicating th e hitherto rarely considered, potential association between these vitamins and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Robustness Veri ﬁcation We veri ﬁed the robustness of the results by three independent means.First, w e asked if the prediction performance was in ﬂuenced by the ICD-10 categories.When the prediction performances were compared between the random forest classi ﬁers trained using the dataset from the F2 population and the classi ﬁers trained using the dataset from the other population, the AUC wasnot statistically different (DeLong ’s test), except in the case of vitB 1(see Supplementary Table 6 ).Second, we used different cut-off values to de ﬁne the deﬁciency ( 14–16).
Although the AUC for the validation set, shown in Supplementary Table 7 , tended to be higher when strict cut-off values were used, the obtained AUCs were notstatistically signi ﬁcant (p > 0.05, DeLong ’st e s tw i t h Bonferroni correction). Third, we investigated if the prediction performance was inﬂuenced by the way the dataset was split into the training and validation set.Here, we trained and evaluated random forest classi ﬁers using a dataset split in a reversed way (see Methods section for details).The AUCs for the validation set were 0.771,0.621, and 0.745 for vitB 1, vitB 12, and folate, respectively; none were statistically different from the AUC trained using theoriginal setting (DeLong ’s test), further demonstrating the robustness of the performance.Subsampling Analysis To estimate the number needed to saturate the performance, we examined the relationship between the generalizabilityand the sample size ( 17).
We randomly sampled X% of the training set, trained random forest classi ﬁers using the dataset, and evaluated the generalization performance byAUCs using the validation set (X = 30, 35, 40, …,9 5 ,a n d1 0 0 ; see Methods for details). As shown in Figure 4 ,t h e relationships between AUC and the training size for vitB 1 and vitB 12were almost saturated, whereas that for folate is not saturated.To quantitatively understand this, we ﬁtted each curve using a saturating function formulated inequation (1) (see Methods section for details).The ﬁtted parameters of equation (1) were as follows; for vitB 1,a= 0.186 and b = 0.074; for vitB 12,a=0 .0 9 9a n db=0 .1 5 6 ;a n dTABLE 3 | Summary of full dataset of 29 parameters for machine-learning.

By using these parameter values and extrapolating the curve, we then computed howmany additional samples are necessary to reach almostmaximum performances. To reach 99% of the maximump e r f o r m a n c e[ i .e .,Y=( a+0 .5 )×0 .9 9i ne q u a t i o n( 1 ) ] ,t h e training dataset to be collected was 92.5%, 143%, and 341%of the training size in this study for vitB 1,v i t B 12,a n df o l a t e , respectively.These quantitative analyses revealed thatcollecting further similar datasets up to 1,000 patients (e.g.four years × hospitals with similar scale as Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center) may increase andreproduce the generalizability for folate, while the effect ofcollecting further dataset is expected to be small for vitB 1 and vitB 12.
DISCUSSION Relevance of The Present Study Based on the largest cohort to date of patients at imminent risk of seriously harming them selves or others, this study indicated that de ﬁciency of certain vitamins can be predicted in an ef ﬁcient manner via machine-learning using routine blood test results. The 29 routine blood variables are availableat almost all hospitals/clinics and are necessary to rule outother comorbid physical problems.Given the large number ofpatients with vitamin B de ﬁciencies, empirical therapy might be acceptable; however, risk strati ﬁcation is preferred for personalized medicine and sh ared decision-making.The prediction method presente d here may expedite clinical decision-making as to whether vitamins should beprescribed to a patient ( Graphical Abstract ).FIGURE 2 | Histogram and ROC curves of each vitamin B value.(A–C)The histograms for vitamin B 1, vitamin B 12, and folate (vitamin B 9).

For random forest classi ﬁers, sensitivity, speci ﬁcity, and accuracy of the classi ﬁcation at the optimal operating points that maximized accuracy on the receiver operating characteristic curve of the validation set are also shown (see alsoFigures 2D –F).
Accuracy was de ﬁned as the average of the sensitivity and speci ﬁcity. Square brackets indicate the 95% con ﬁdence interval.For further information, see Figure 2andSupplementary Table 5 .AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.Tamune et al.Vitamin De ﬁciency Predicted by Machine-Learning Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org February 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 1029 6 Remarkably, the AUC of folate de ﬁciency was 0.796.The robustness of folate prediction was also suggested by variousindependent methods and statistics.Folate has a potential to maintain neuronal integrity and is one of the homocysteine- reducing B-vitamins ( 5).Homocysteine may be linked to the etiology of schizophrenia ( 18), and vitamin B supplements have been reported to reduce psychiatric symptoms signi ﬁcantly in patients with schizophrenia ( 7).A recent meta-review has pointed out that the bioactivity of the supplement should be considered (e.g.
methylfolate, which successfully crosses the blood-brain barrier, has been reported effective, whereas theeffect of other forms of folate is equivocal) ( 19). As our study does not present longitudinal clinical courses, an interventioneffect of folate supplementation to the cohort based on ourmethod remains to be clari ﬁed.Biological Mechanism Prediction To connect with biological knowledge, we compared four models with high interpretability in this study.Using the random forest FIGURE 3 | Gini importance and partial dependence plots of vitamin B de ﬁciencies.The Gini importance (A–C)and partial dependency plots of the probability of deﬁciency (D–F)are shown for the eight most important variables for vitamin B 1,v i t a m i nB 12, and folate (vitamin B 9).
Combined with these, this machine-learning classi ﬁer without hypothesis also provided further evidence of a relationship between vitamin B levels and the complete blood count while also indicating a pot ential association between these vitamins and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

Vitamin De ﬁciency Predicted by Machine-Learning Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org February 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 1029 7 classi ﬁers, as shown in Figure 3 , we identi ﬁed several items related to complete blood count as top hits. Notably, ourclassi ﬁer was blind to any biological knowledge, including the well-established association between anemia and vitamin Bdeﬁciency, including folate ( 20).The results provide further evidence of a relationship between vitamin B levels and the complete blood count and support the use of machine-learning to investigate novel, underlying biological mechanisms ( 21).ALP and its metabolites indicate the vitamin B 6status ( 22); low vitB 12is potentially associated with low ALP ( 23).More generally, ALP may have a close and complicated relationshipwith the overall vitamin B group.
Autoimmune disorders, especially thyroid disease, are commonly associated with pernicious anaemia ( 24), but there has been no established hypothesis regarding the causal relationships between thyroiddisease and vitamin B de ﬁciencies. The potential association between the levels of these vitamins and ALP or TSH awaitsfurther study, both via investigations of populations and basic research ( 25).Limitations This study is subject to several limitations.First, the ﬁndings of this single-center retrospective study may have limited external generalizability, though internal generalizability was considered tothe maximum extent.Second, the patients ’basic characteristics and long-term prognosis were not fully investigated due toadministrative restrictions.Though there is similar involuntary treatment/admission in psychiatry worldwide, there is a gap between legislation and practice ( 26).Therefore, the extent to which this method can expedite clinical decision-making is unclear.
Further, we did not investigate the relationship between serological values and the need for intervention. The lack of datafor vitamin B de ﬁciency in the Japanese general population hampered the comparison between the experimental cohort and their counterparts who lacked psychiatric symptoms.Establishing appropriate reference values and an assessment method requiresfurther investigation.Finally, we did not assess the predictive valueof other nutritional impairments, including vitamin B 6and homocysteine de ﬁciency, which were previously shown to have a close link with psychiatric symptoms ( 3,5); however, our study provides fundamental data on nutritional impairment based on the largest cohort of patients with intense psychiatric episode everassembled for this purpose and presents a potential framework forpredicting nutritional impairment using machine-learning.
Conclusion The present report is, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst to demonstrate that machine-learning can ef ﬁciently predict nutritional impairment. This study also provides a possibleapplication of machine-learning to investigate novel, underlying biological mechanisms.Further research isneeded to validate the external generalizability of theﬁndings in other clinical situations and clarify whether interventions based on this method can improve patient careand cost-effectiveness.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT T h es o u r c ec o d ei sa v a i l a b l eo nh t t p s : / / g i t h u b .c o m / u k k y 1 7 /vitaminPrediction.The datasets utilized in the current study areavailable from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.ETHICS STATEMENT The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Research Ethics Committee, Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center.Informed consent was obtained fromparticipants using an optout form on the website.
