This review summarizes all known and putative PLP-binding proteins found in the Escherichia coli MG1655 proteome. PLP can have toxic effects since it contains a very reactive aldehyde group at its 4 9position that easily forms aldimines with primary and sec- ondary amines and reacts with thiols.Most PLP is bound either to theenzymes that use it as a cofactor or to PLP carrier proteins, protected from the cellular environment but at the same time readily transferable to PLP-dependent apoenzymes.E.coli and its relatives synthesize PLP through the seven-step deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate (DXP)-dependent pathway.Other bacteria synthesize PLP in a single step, through a so- called DXP-independent pathway.Although the DXP-dependent pathwaywas the ﬁrst to be revealed, the discovery of the widespread DXP-inde- pendent pathway determined a decline of interest in E.coli vitamin B 6me- tabolism.In E.
coli , as in most organisms, PLP can also be obtained from PL, PN, and PM, imported from the environment or recycled from protein turnover, via a salvage pathway. Our review deals with all aspects of vita- min B 6metabolism in E.coli , from transcriptional to posttranslational reg- ulation.A critical interpretation of results is presented, in particular, con- cerning the most obscure aspects of PLP homeostasis and delivery to PLP-dependent enzymes.KEYWORDS Escherichia coli, metabolism, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, vitamin B6 PLP HOMEOSTASIS IN THE ESCHERICHIA COLI CELL Pyridoxal 5 9-phosphate (PLP) is one of the six interconvertible vitamers whose ensemble goes by the name of vitamin B 6.The other B 6vitamers areReceived: 11 January 2021 Accepted: 16 February 2021 Posted: 1 April 2021 Editor: Tyrrell Conway, Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics,Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA Citation: EcoSal Plus 2021; doi: 10.1128/ ecosalplus.ESP-0004-2021 .

Almost 1.5% of all genes in mostprokaryotic genomes encode PLP-dependent enzymes (2).They catalyze many different transformations, such astransamination, decarboxylation, racemization, side chaincleavage, b-a n d g-elimination, and replacement reactions (1). Using the B 6database (2), a tool for the description and classi ﬁcation of vitamin B 6-dependent enzyme activ- ities and of the corresponding protein families ( http:// bioinformatics.unipr.it/B6db ), all known and putative PLP-binding proteins found in the E.coli MG1655 pro- teome (57 in total) were retrieved, and they are summar-ized in Table 1 .Twenty enzymes are involved in amino acid biosynthesis, while 10 are responsible for the biosyn-thesis of other molecules, such as coenzymes, polysaccha-rides, and polyamines.Many are catabolic enzymes, and aputative PLP carrier protein (PLPHP, see below) and two PLP-dependent transcriptional regulators (YdcR and YjiR, see below) are also present.Importantly, in E.
coli , 26% of these PLP-dependent proteins are essential for autotrophicgrowth, as the corresponding deletion strains are unableto grow in minimal medium ( https://ecocyc.org/ ). This underlines the importance of PLP for bacterial life.Besides its role as a cofactor in catalytic processes, PLPplays other roles inside the bacterial cell.E.coli is a fac- ultative anaerobe which thrives in either the presenceor absence of oxygen; therefore, it has to counteract re-active oxygen species (ROS).It has been demonstratedthat increasing concentrations of PN and PLP increaseO 2decay in vitro (3).Moreover, these B 6vitamers are more ef ﬁcient quenchers than sulfur-containing antiox- idants and quench O 2at a rate comparable to that of vitamins E and C (3).
Of all the B 6vitamers, PN shows the highest antioxidant activity, being able to scavengeup to eight ·OH radicals under high hydroxyl radicalconcentrations (4).PLP also acts as a cofactor and effector molecule for a group of bacterial transcriptional regulators, calledMocR transcription factors (MocR-TFs), chimeric pro- teins formed by the joining of a helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain and the protein scaffold of fold type IPLP-dependent enzymes (5, 6). A member of the MocRsubfamily, PdxR, plays a fundamental role in the tran-scriptional regulation of vitamin B 6biosynthesis in Corynebacterium glutamicum (7), Streptococcus pneu- moniae (8), Listeria monocytogenes (9), and Bacillus clausii (10).In these bacteria, PdxR activates the tran- scription of the pdxST operon, which encodes the subunits of the PLP synthase complex (Fig.S1) thatsynthetizes PLP directly from glutamine, ribulose 5-phosphate, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (11).Asdetailed below, in E.
coli , PLP is synthetized through a different and more complex pathway. The total number of vitamin B 6molecules per cell was measured in the HMS174 E.coli strain using an enzyme assay and reported to be about 188,000, with 42% ofthese in the PLP form, 51% in a combination of the PNPand PMP forms, and 7% as PL.The levels of the PN andPM vitamers were under the detection limit.The same work estimated that about 60% of intracellular PLP is bound to proteins (12).PLP contains a very reactivealdehyde group at its 4 9position that easily forms aldi- mines with primary and secondary amines and reactswith thiols.Therefore, PLP can have toxic effects, andnonspeci ﬁc binding to cell components should be kept to a minimum.Presumably, most PLP is bound either to the enzymes that use it as a cofactor or to PLP carrier proteins, such as PLPHP, formerly named YggS.
The lat-ter is a ubiquitous PLP-binding protein, with no catalyticactivity, and is structurally homologous to the fold typeIII PLP-dependent enzymes, of which bacterial alanineracemase is the archetype (13). Although the metabolic role of this carrier protein has not been entirely charac- terized, the phenotype of E.coli yggS knockout cells reﬂects an imbalance in PLP homeostasis (14).Besides PLPHP, two essential proteins involved in PLP biosyn-thesis and salvage pathways (see below), PdxH andPdxK, have also been proposed to act as PLP-carrier pro- teins.PdxH tightly binds PLP deriving from its own cata- lytic activity at a secondary site, distinct from the activesite (15).Our group has recently demonstrated that thissecondary site coincides with an allosteric site that regu-lates the activity of the enzyme through PLP feedback in-hibition (16).In a similar fashion, PLP produced duringTramonti et al.2 EcoSalPlus.asm.org TABLE 1 PLP-binding proteins in E.

Different colors correspond to different functions, as speci ﬁed in “Biological process ” column.Tramonti et al. 4 EcoSalPlus.asm.org theE.coli PdxK catalytic turnover binds to a lysine resi- due positioned near the active site, thus inhibiting its ac- tivity (17).All these PLP carriers may act as a protein-bound reservoir of PLP, protecting it from the cellular environment but at the same time making it readily transferable to PLP-dependent apoenzymes (Fig.1).It has been already demonstrated in vitro that both PdxH and PdxK are able to transfer the tightly bound PLP toapoenzymes (17, 18).In the absence of an external source of vitamin B 6,t h e main supply of PLP comes from its de novo biosynthe- sis (Fig.1).E.coli synthesizes PLP through the so- called deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate (DXP)-dependent pathway, using the primary metabolites erythrose-4-phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and pyruvate (Fig.2).This pathway consists of two branches.
In one branch, the D-erythrose-4-phosphate sugar, coming from the pentose phosphate pathway, is converted to 3-amino- 1-hydroxyacetone 1-phosphate through three reactions. Inthe other branch, a single enzyme condenses the glycolytic intermediates pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to yield DXP.Finally, DXP and 3-amino-1-hydroxyace- tone 1-phosphate are condensed in a reaction catalyzed by PNP synthase (PdxJ) that produces PNP, which is thenoxidized to PLP by PdxH.In E.coli ,a si nm o s to r g a n i s m s , PLP can also be obtained from PL, PN, and PM, imported from the environment or recycled from protein turnover, via a salvage pathway (Fig.1).This pathway interconvertsthe different forms of vitamers using the following enzymes: pyridoxine (pyridoxamine) 5'-phosphate oxidase (PdxH), nonspeci ﬁca n ds p e c i ﬁc phosphatases (such as YbhA (19)), the kinase PdxK, which is also able to phos-phorylate PL, PN, and PM (20), and the kinase PdxY, which is speci ﬁc for PL (21).
Recently, PL reductase, which converts PN to PL, has been proposed as an im-portant component of the salvage pathway (22) (Fig. 2).If B 6transporters of the ECF (energy-coupling factor) family have been identi ﬁed in other bacteria (23), lit- tle is known about the transport of B 6vitamers across theE.coli cellular membrane.It was suggested that PLP is not imported into E.coli cells, while dephos- phorylated vitamers are imported (24).Dated evi- dence has shown that in Salmonella typhimurium and in lactic bacteria, PN and PL, but not PM, can enterthe cell by facilitated diffusion.Then, phosphoryla- tion of the 5 9hydroxyl group by pyridoxal kinase ef ﬁ- ciently traps the vitamers inside the cell (25, 26).Theidentity of the transmembrane protein involved in the transport of B 6vitamers across the membrane is not known; nor is it known whether a speci ﬁc protein plays such a role.
Factors contributing to the lowering of the intracellular PLP pool are dilution by growth and chemical damage (Fig. 1).In fact, PLP is one of the more damage-prone metabolites that face spontaneous chemical reactions (27).No evidence has been reported about the enzymecatabolism of PLP in E.coli .Two catabolic pathways were identi ﬁed in Pseudomonas ,Arthrobacter , and Mesorhizobium loti , which through either 8 or 5 steps, respectively, give as ﬁnal products acetate, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and either succinic semialdehyde or 2- (hydroxymethyl)-4-oxobutanoate (28); however, the complete pathway has not yet been identi ﬁed in other microorganisms whose genome has been sequenced.Ithas been reported that in rat, the oxidation of PL to 4- pyridoxic acid is catalyzed by a NAD 1-dependent alde- hyde dehydrogenase (29).In E.coli , a similar activity could be linked to AldB, which catalyzes the NADP-de- pendent oxidation of diverse aldehydes, such as benzal- dehyde (30).
It should be noted that if PM seems absent from the E. colicell (12), PMP may derive from aminotransferase reactions.FIG 1 Scheme of PLP homeostasis in E.coli .This ﬁgure summarizes all the different factors contributing to PLPhomeostasis in the E.coli cells.The pool of free PLP is in equilibrium with other B 6vitamers, and PLP bound to speci ﬁc PLP-binding protein.PLP supply processes are in blue, whereasconsuming processes are in red.Vitamin B6Metabolism in Escherichia coli EcoSalPlus.asm.org 5 FIG 2 Scheme of PLP biosynthesis and salvage pathways.Primary metabolites, erythrose-4-phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phoshpate, and pyruvate, used as starting substrates, are in green, whereas intermediate metabolites are in black.Enzymes are in blue.Tramonti et al.6 EcoSalPlus.asm.org GENES INVOLVED IN VITAMIN B6 METABOLISM Genes involved in vitamin B 6metabolism are spread all over the E.coli chromosome.Only pdxH andpdxY are cotranscribed (Fig.3).
At the same time, almost allgenes encoding enzymes involved in the PLP biosynthe-sis and salvage pathways are part of complex operons.Because bacterial operons often contain genes withrelated functions, it has been proposed that the inclu-sion of PLP biosynthetic genes in complex, multifunc-tional operons may act genetically to integrate PLP biosynthesis into several branches of intermediary me- tabolism (31). In the following paragraphs, all the oper-ons and genes related to PLP metabolism are described.Genes Involved in PLP Biosynthesis epd Theepd(orgapB ) gene located between 3,072,672 and 3,073,691 kb on the bacterial chromosome encodes D-erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (UniProt P0A9B6 ).This tetrameric enzyme catalyzes the ﬁrst reaction in thede novo PLP biosynthesis, namely, the NAD-de- pendent oxidation of D-erythrose-4-phosphate (Fig.2 ).
This enzyme is homologous to glyceraldehyde 3-phos-phate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, encoded by the gapA gene), a key enzyme of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis,with which it shares more than 40% amino acidsequence identity (32). However, Epd shows an ef ﬁ- cient nonphosphorylating erythrose-4-phosphate de- hydrogenase activity and a low phosphorylatingglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity; incontrast, GAPDH shows a highly ef ﬁcient phospho- rylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseactivity and a low nonphosphorylating erythrose-4-phos-phate dehydrogenase activity (33).The low nonphosphor-ylating erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase activity of the highly abundant gapA -encoded GAPDH allows growth of an epdmutant strain (34).Theepdgene is cotranscribed either with pgkandfbaA or with only pgk(Fig.3A) (35).
The pgkandfbaA genes are essential genes encoding the glycolytic enzymes phospho-glycerate kinase (UniProt P0A799 )a n df r u c t o s e - b i s p h o s - p h a t ea l d o l a s e( U n i P r o t P0AB71 ), respectively. The expression of epdm i g h ta l s ob ed i s j o i n t e df r o mt h a to f pgkandfbaA, as these two genes are also transcribed from three promoters located downstream of epd(35).pdxB ThepdxB gene (located between position 2,436,715 and 2,437,851 kb on the E.coli chromosome) encodes 4- phosphoerythronate dehydrogenase (UniProt P05459 ), which catalyzes the second reaction of the PLP biosyn- thetic pathway, consisting in the NAD-dependent oxi- dation of 4-phosphoerythronate to 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-4-phosphobutanoate (Fig.2 ).This protein is homologous toD-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Fig.S2), encoded byserA, which catalyzes the ﬁrst step of the L-serine bio- synthetic pathway (36).InE.
coli ,pdxB is the ﬁrst gene of a multifunctional op- eron, which contains three other genes: usg,truA, and dedA (Fig. 3B).The usggene encodes a putative semial- dehyde dehydrogenase (UniProt P08390 ), as suggested by its sequence similarity to aspartate b-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (37 ).The truA gene product is tRNA pseudouridine synthase I (UniProt P07649 ), which cat- alyzes the modi ﬁcation of speci ﬁc uridine residues in the anticodon stem and loop of certain tRNA species.The resulting pseudouridine residues improve the ef ﬁ- ciency of translation by stabilizing the structure oftRNAs and ensuring reading frame maintenance (38 ).The last gene of the pdxB operon is dedA , encoding an uncharacterized inner membrane protein (UniProtP0ABP6 ), a member of the DedA family.Of these four genes, only pdxB is absolutely required for growth of bacteria on minimal medium, as the pdxB mutant is auxotrophic for PN (39).
Although thesegenes form an operon, their functions appear to be unrelated to each other. However, the close association ofpdxB and truA is evolutionarily conserved among different enterobacterial species (39).Two different transcription units were identi ﬁed: the ﬁrst unit includes all four genes forming the operon, and it is transcribed from the P pdxBpromoter, whereas the other unit contains the last three genes and is tran- scribed from an internal promoter (P usg) located near the end of the pdxB coding region (40).The P pdxBpro- moter shares the same –10 region with an overlapping divergent promoter which controls the expression oftheﬂkgene encoding a ﬂagellar regulator (UniProt P15286 ) (36 , 41).However, a functional association between the pdxB andﬂkgenes is yet to be found.Vitamin B6Metabolism in Escherichia coli EcoSalPlus.asm.org 7 serC The serC gene (located between position 957,653 and 958,741 kb on the E.
coli chromosome) codes for phos- phoserine/phosphohydroxythreonine aminotransferase (UniProt P23721 ), an enzyme involved in both PLP and L-serine biosynthesis by using different substrates (42 ). Inthe PLP biosynthesis pathway, SerC adds an amino group to 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-4-phosphobutanoate (produced byPdxB) to form 3-hydroxy-4-phospho- L-threonine (Fig.2); in the serine pathway, SerC adds an amino group to 3-phos- phohydroxypyruvate to form 3-phosphoserine (Fig.S2).In both transamination reactions, the amino-group donor is L- glutamate, which is then converted into 2-oxoglutarate.The FIG 3 Schematic representations of operons involved in PLP homeostasis.Numbers indicate the genome positions in kb.The blue arrows represent mRNAs.The position of promoters is indicated.Tramonti et al.8 EcoSalPlus.asm.org enzyme does not show any activity with nonphosphorylated substrates (43).
Interestingly, since SerC needs PLP as acofactor for its enzyme activities, PLP is involved in its ownbiosynthesis (43). The serC gene forms an operon with the aroA gene, which encodes the enzyme 3-phosposhikimate 1-car-boxyvinyltransferase (UniProt P0A6D3 ) (44 ).This enzyme is involved in the chorismate pathway, whichleads to the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids.Mutants of serC are auxotrophic for L-serine and PN, while aroA mutants require aromatic amino acids; thus, both genes are essential for growth in minimal medium(42).The serC-aroA operon is transcribed from the P serC promoter located upstream of serC (Fig.3C).As a con- sequence, the number of encoded enzymes may be simultaneously regulated at the transcriptional level.However, serC can also be transcribed as a monocis- tronic mRNA from the same promoter.
In addition, aRho factor-independent transcription terminator FIG 3 (Continued)Vitamin B6Metabolism in Escherichia coli EcoSalPlus.asm.org 9 located between serC andaroA is responsible for tran- scriptional attenuation, which leads to an increasedexpression of serC with respect to aroA (45). The arrangement of serC andaroA genes in a single op- eron does not seem to be accidental, since it can guar-antee a coordinated regulation of PLP, serine, andchorismate biosynthetic pathways.In fact, it should bepointed out that these pathways are connected by threeimportant features.First, PLP and chorismate pathways share erythrose 4-phosphate as the starting substrate.Second, equimolar amounts of serine and chorismateare required for the biosynthesis of the iron chelatorenterochelin.Third, PLP, serine, and aromatic com-pounds are also linked in numerous steps and branches of intermediary metabolism.
For example, chorismate is the precursor of tetrahydrofolate, which captures one-carbon units when L-serine is cleaved to glycine by the PLP-dependent enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransfer-ase (45). pdxA4-Hydroxythreonine-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (UniProt P19624 ), encoded by the pdxA gene (encompassing posi- tion 52,427 to 53,416 kb of the E.coli chromosome), cata- lyzes the fourth step in the PLP biosynthesis pathway(Fig.2 ).PdxA is a NAD1-dependent dehydrogenase re- sponsible for the oxidation of 4-hydroxythreonine-4-phos-phate to 3-amino-1-hydroxyacetone-1-phosphate (46).A pdxA mutant is able to grow on minimal medium only if supplemented with PN or PL.The pdxA gene is part of a complex operon, which can give rise to different transcription units: lptD (from ei- ther the impp1 or impp2 promoters), lptD-surA-pdxA (from the impp3 promoter), surA-pdxA-rmsA-apaGH , pdxA-rsmA-apaGH ,pdxA-rmsA ,rmsa-apaGH , and apaGH (47) (Fig.3D).
The ﬁrst gene of the operon, lptD (lipopolysaccharide transport), encodes an essential protein of the outer mem-brane (UniProt P31554 ), required for lipopolysaccharide assembly (48 ). Considering that the decrease of lptD expression causes an increase of sensitivity to organic sol- vents (49), and lptD mutants show an increase in the membrane permeability (50), LptD is important for bothorganic solvent tolerance and outer membrane integrity.The surA gene, downstream of lptD,c o d e sf o raperiplasmic peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (UniProt P0ABZ6 ), which is a chaperone required for folding and assembly ofseveral outer membrane proteins, including OmpA, O m p F ,a n dL a m B .I th a sb e e nr e p o r t e dt h a t surA mutants are unable to survive in stationary phase at high pH (51 ).surA expression increases in cultures of high density, as well as at low or high pH conditions.
Another gene form-ing the operon is rsmA (also denoted as ksgA), whose gene product is a methyltransferase (UniProt P06992 )t h a t catalyzes the methylation of two adjacent adenosines in the 16S rRNA of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Interestingly,the KsgA protein binds speci ﬁcally to its own mRNA, and it may regulate its own translation (52 ).It has been shown that the mutation of rsmA induces resistance to kasuga- mycin, an inhibitor of translation initiation, without sub-stantial growth defects.The penultimate gene of the operon is apaG , encoding a DUF525 domain-containing protein (UniProt P62672 ), whereas the last gene is apaH , coding for a diadenosine tetraphosphatase (UniProt P05637 ).Both apaG andapaH belong to a group of genes involved in stress-activated mutagenesis (53 ).
In particu- lar, ApaH hydrolyzes diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap 4), produced as a side product of aminoacyl-tRNA synthe- tases, as well as molecules related to Ap 4.R e c e n t l y ,i tw a s reported that ApaH removes caps containing Ap 4and Gp 4at the 5 9end of RNA molecules, generating a diphos- phorylated RNA product (54). Concerning the regulation of all these genes, the lptD- surA-pdxA-rsmA-apaG-apaH operon contains at least eight promoters.In the P lptDregion, located upstream of lptD (Fig.3D), three promoter sequences were identi- ﬁed: impp1, impp2, and impp3.The ﬁrst two depend on the sDfactor and are responsible for the constitutive expression of the lptD gene in equal measure (55), whereas the impp3 sequence is sE-dependent and con- trols the transcription of the polycistronic lptD-surA- pdxA mRNA.Speci ﬁcally, the sEfactor is the sigma fac- tor of RNA polymerase responding to heat shock orother environment stresses that cause an accumulationof misfolded polypeptides (56).
P surAis another pro- moter in this operon recognized by the sEfactor that leads to the formation of the surA-pdxA-rmsA-apaGH cotranscript. Interestingly, surA is always cotranscribed with pdxA , and insertion mutants in surA cause PN auxotrophy (41).The transcription of pdxA also occurs from the P pdxApromoter, which drives the formation of the pdxA-rsmA-apaGH and pdxA-rmsA transcripts.Two other promoters are present downstream of pdxA :Tramonti et al.10 EcoSalPlus.asm.org the P rmsApromoter, located at the end of the pdxA gene (47), and a promoter within the rmsA gene, from which the transcription of both the apaG andapaH genes ini- tiates (57).dxsThe essential dxsgene (position 438,315 to 440,177 kb, in the genome) encodes 1-deoxy- D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (UniProt P77488 ), which catalyzes the thiamine diphosphate-dependent condensation between pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) to yield DXP (Fig.2 ).
This metabolite is also an intermediate of the isoprenoid and thiamine biosynthesis pathways (58, 59). The transcript containing dxsis the xseB-ispA-dxs-yajO mRNA, which originates from the P xseBpromoter (58) (Fig.3E).The xseB gene product is the small subunit of exonuclease VII (UniProt P0A8G9 ).Like dxs, the ispA gene is involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis.It is an essential gene encoding the enzyme geranyl diphos-phate/farnesyl diphosphate synthase (UniProt P22939 ), which catalyzes two sequential reactions in the polyiso- prenoid biosynthetic pathway (60 ).The yajO gene can also be transcribed as a single transcriptional unit from its own promoter.It is functionally linked to dxs, since it encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of DXP from ribulose 5-phosphate (1-deoxyxylulose-5- phosphate synthase; UniProt P77735 ), providing an al- ternative, albeit less ef ﬁcient, route to supply DXP (61 ).
pdxJPyridoxine 5 9-phosphate synthase (PdxJ; UniProt P0A794 ) is a homooctameric enzyme that catalyzes the complex intramolecular condensation reaction between DXP and 3-amino-1-hydroxyacetone 1-phosphate to form PNP (Fig. 2 ) (62, 63).The pdxJ gene, located in the E.coli chromosome between 2,700,998 and 2,701,729 kb, can be transcribed from two different promoters, which give two different transcription units.The P rncpromoter directs transcrip- tion of ﬁve genes ( rnc-era-recO-pdxJ-acpS ), while tran- scription of the pdxJ-acpS mRNA initiates from P pdxJ (Fig.3F) (64).The rncanderagenes are both important for ef ﬁcient ribosomal processing and maturation.The rnc gene encodes RNase III (RNase III; UniProt P0A7Y0 ), an endonuclease speci ﬁc for double-strandedRNA.In E.coli , the main substrates for RNase III are the rRNAs transcribed from the seven E.coli rRNA operons leading to rRNA processing.
However, this en- donuclease is considered a global regulator because, bycleaving transcripts at either the 3' or 5' untranscribedregions of genes, but also within coding regions, it plays a general role in posttranscriptional gene expression control. Moreover, RNase III is involved in the defenseagainst viral infection (65 ).Despite the important role that RNase III plays in rRNA processing, it is not essen- tial for cell viability.In the absence of RNase III, thefull-length ribosomal operon transcript is processed byother ribonucleases to generate 16S and 23S rRNAs, albeit more slowly (66).In contrast, erais essential for viability.It encodes a GTPase (UniProt P06616 ) that interacts with RNase III at the level of the precursorrRNA, carrying out the maturation of the 30S ribosomal subunit.RecO (UniProt P0A7H3 ) is involved in RecA- mediated homologous recombination (67 ).The down- stream acpS gene is also essential for viability (64).
It encodes the holo-acyl-carrier-protein synthase (AcpS; UniProt P24224 ) involved in lipid synthesis by transfer- ring the 4-phosphopantetheine moiety of CoA to theacyl-carrier protein, activating this important compo-nent of fatty acid biosynthesis (68 ). Three major transcripts are found in this unit (Fig.3F).The abundant 1.9-kb rnc-era and the less-abundant 3.7- kbrnc-era-recO-pdxJ-acpS mRNAs are expressed from Prnc, whereas the 1.3-kb pdxJ-acpS mRNA is transcribed from P pdxJ(67).Expression studies carried out using various genetic fusions showed that pdxJ is mainly tran- scribed from P rncbut is translated 2.5-fold more ef ﬁ- ciently from the 1.3-kb pdxJ-acpS mRNA than from the 3.7-kb rnc-era-recO-pdxJ-acp S transcript.
The expres- sion of the rnc-era-recO-pdxJ-acpS operon is negatively autoregulated at the level of mRNA stability by RNaseIII, which cleaves a stem-loop in its own 5' untran- scribed region, causing the mRNA to become vulnera- ble to degradation by other ribonucleases. In contrast,no apparent effect of RNase III is observed on the P pdxJ- dependent 1.3-kb pdxJ-acpS mRNA (67).pdxH The pdxH gene (located at position 1,717,351 to 1,718,007 kb of the E.coli chromosome) encodes the ﬂa- vin mononucleotide-dependent enzyme (UniProtP0AFI7 ) catalyzing the oxidation of PNP to PLP, as theVitamin B6Metabolism in Escherichia coli EcoSalPlus.asm.org 11 ﬁnal step of PLP biosynthesis, and the oxidation of PMP to PLP in the PLP salvage pathway (Fig.2 ).In both reactions, the ﬁnal electron acceptor is oxygen, which is reduced to H 2O2(31).pdxH mutants are PL auxotrophs (31) but do not grow as the wild-type strain even in the presence of a high concentration of thisvitamer (22).
pdxH is an essential gene in both the pres- ence or absence of oxygen, suggesting that an unidenti-ﬁed compound acts as the electron acceptor in the absence of O 2(31). Two different transcription units are found in this operon (pdxH-tyrS-pdxY andtyrS-pdxY ) (Fig.3G), making it the sole case where genes involved in PLP biosynthesis andsalvage pathways are cotranscribed.Indeed, downstream from the tyrSessential gene, encoding tyrosyl-tRNA syn- thetase (UniProt P0AGJ9 ), responsible for the attachment ofL-tyrosine to tRNA(Tyr), is the pdxY gene encoding pyridoxal kinase 2 (UniProt P77150 ;s e en e x tp a r a g r a p h ) .Importantly, tyrSmutations are lethal.About 20% of tyrS transcripts originate from the P pdxHpromoter, whereas the remaining 80% originate from the P tyrSpromoter.This lat- ter promoter is about four times stronger than P pdxH, explaining the difference in steady-state amounts of thepdxH-tyrS andtyrS-pdxY transcripts (31 ).
A possible, in- dependent pdxY promoter has also been identi ﬁed by a genome-wide study using gfptranscriptional fusions (69) (Fig. 3G).Without this last promoter, pdxY transcription would originate only from the P pdxHand P tyrSpromoters.Therefore, tyrSandpdxY would always be cotranscribed.Blockage of transcription from P pdxH,b ya ni n s e r t i o ni n pdxH , reduced the amount of the tyrStranscript by about 20%, while it reduced PL kinase activity by about 25%.This suggests a low level of coupling between the tran- scription of pdxH and that of pdxY .About 92% of tyrS transcripts terminate at a terminator located between tyrS andpdxY , and only about 8% read through into pdxY .Therefore, this terminator attenuates pdxY expression compared to tyrS.Nevertheless, cotranscription of pdxY andtyrSmay provide a point of genetic integration that coordinates incorporation of amino acids into proteinswith PLP coenzyme supply (21).
Evolutionary Considerations on the DXP-Dependent Pathway A phylogenetic and comparative genomics analysis car- ried out in 2001 indicated that the DXP-dependentpathway of PLP biosynthesis is mainly limited to E. coliand gammaproteobacteria (70).This information con- cerning the distribution of vitamin B 6biosynthesis pathways should be reviewed in light of the current increased availability of genomic data.Archaea, fungi, plants, and many bacteria rely on the action of the PLP synthase complex (coded by the Pdx1 and Pdx2 genes in plants, and by the pdxST operon in bacteria), which directly produces PLP from glutamine, either ribose or ribulose 5-phosphate, and either glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate or dihydroxyacetone phosphate (Fig.S1)(11).
Since the gdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recent lineage of prokaryotic evolution, it has been suggested that, in the primordial environment where these bacteria lived, PLP was present in the envi- ronment, so that the Pdx1-Pdx2 function was lost from their genome (11); however, when, following changes in the environment, PLP became scarcer and the need to produce it arose, gammaproteobacteria did not evolve a novel PLP biosynthesis pathway from scratch but mostly drew on the existing metabolisms to create a pathway that produces PNP (36). The salvage pathwayevolved before this event (70), and therefore PNP oxi- dase was already present to convert PNP into PLP.On the other hand, PdxJ is evolutionarily distinct but highly similar to Pdx1 in structural and mechanistic terms, suggesting that it is an example of convergent evolution (11).The function of Dxs is not only limited to PLP biosynthesis but is also involved in isoprenoid biosyn- thesis (58).
The ﬁrst branch of PLP biosynthesis prob- ably derives from the serine biosynthesis pathway by gene recruitment (36). In fact, at a glance, the inter- mediates of the two routes are very similar (Fig.2 andFig.S2).Moreover, the two pathways share the same enzyme, SerC, and as mentioned before, pdxB andserA are homologous (36).We also want to point out that strong evidence supporting this hypothesis derives from the observation that a DpdxB strain is still able to slowly grow at 30°C in the absence of vitamin B 6supplementa- tion (42), suggesting that PLP can be synthesized by dif- ferent routes.In 2010, Kim et al., by overexpressing different E.coli genes, characterized a serendipitous pathway that leads to PLP synthesis in the absence of PdxB.This pathway uses an intermediate of serine bio-synthesis, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, and three enzymes to bypass the reactions catalyzed by PdxB and SerC in PLP biosynthesis.
It consists of NudL, a putative CoA pyrophosphohydrolase, which hydrolyzes 3-phosphohy- droxypyruvate to 3-hydroxypyruvate (3HP) that is spon- taneously decarboxylated to produce glycolaldehyde;Tramonti et al. 12 EcoSalPlus.asm.org LtaE, a low-speci ﬁcity threonine aldolase whose physio- logical function is unknown, which condensates glycolal-dehyde and glycine to a mixture of 4-hydroxythreonineand 4-hydroxy- allo-threonine; and ﬁnally, a promiscuous homoserine kinase (ThrB), which produces 4-phospho- hydroxythreonine (71).Recently, a DpdxB strain, natu- rally selected upon 10 days growth in minimal mediumcontaining glucose as the sole carbon source, was identi-ﬁed to contain a 4-step bypass pathway that restores PLP synthesis, producing levels of vitamers similar to those ofthe wild-type strain.
The bypass pathway consists of mul-tiple phosphatases, which produce erythronate from thenormal substrate 4-phosphoerythronate, 3-phosphogly-cerate dehydrogenase (SerA) that is capable of oxidizing erythronate to (3R)-3,4-dihydroxy-2-oxobutanoate (then converted to 4-hydroxythreonine by SerC), and lastly,ThrB, the kinase producing 4-phosphohydroxythreonine(72). It is worth noting that these serendipitous pathwaystap into the serine biosynthesis pathway.Genes of the Salvage Pathway pdxK andpdxY The pdxK gene, located at position 2,536,386 to 2,537,237 kb of the E.coli chromosome, is one of the few genes involved in PLP metabolism transcribed as a singletranscription unit (Fig.3H).It encodes pyridoxal kinase 1(UniProt P40191 ), the enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-de- pendent phosphorylation of PL, PN, and PM (Fig.2 ) (73).As mentioned above, pyridoxal kinase 2 (encoded by pdxY )w a ss u g g e s t e dt os p e c i ﬁcally phosphorylate PL.Therefore, in E.
coli , two kinases able to phosphorylate B 6 vitamers are present. This ﬁnding derived from an in vivo study carried out on a series of E.coli pdxB mutant strains unable to carry out the de novo synthesis of PLP (73).In particular, a pdxB-pdxK mutant grew in minimal medium supplemented with PL but did not grow on medium sup-plemented with PN, whereas a pdxB-pdxY mutant grew when either PL or PN was present.In contrast, growth ofthepdxB-pdxK-pdxY triple mutant was observed only if precursors that bypass the need for pdxB were present, but not on PL-, PN-, or PM-containing media.Theseexperiments clearly demonstrated that PdxK and PdxYare the only physiologically signi ﬁcant PL, PN, and PM ki- nases in E.coli ,w i t hP d x Yb e i n gs p e c i ﬁc for PL (73).The reason why two kinases of B 6vitamers are present in the E.coli cell is unknown.
It is worth noting that in vitro enzyme activity measurements using recombinantlyexpressed and puri ﬁed PdxY showed that it is endowed with only 1% of the kinase activity measured with PdxK (20). For this reason, it has been suggested that PdxY may play the role of kinase in a different metabolic pathwayand, at the same time, have enough PL kinase activity tosupport growth of E.coli in a medium supplemented with PL when both de novo PLP synthesis and PdxK activity are abolished.However, the crystal structure of recombi-nant PdxY, obtained from a puri ﬁcation procedure with- out addition of exogenous ligands, showed that both active sites of the enzyme dimer were ﬁlled by very tightly bound ligands.In one active site, a mixture of PL and PLPwas present, while in the other active site, a covalently attached form of PL was visible.The presence of these tightly bound ligands made it unlikely that the protein isinvolved in a metabolic pathway different from the PLPsalvage pathway (74).
A possibility is that PdxY may only be active as a component of a multiprotein complex. The pdxK promoter, mapped in a genome-wide study that identi ﬁed several transcription start sites in E.coli (75), has yet to be characterized in detail.DownstreamofpdxK , and transcribed in the opposite direction, yfeK encodes an uncharacterized protein (UniProt Q47702 ).ybhA TheybhA gene (located between 797,613 and 798,431 kb of the E.coli genome) encodes a phosphatase (UniProt P21829 ) belonging to the superfamily of haloacid deha- logenase (HAD)-like hydrolases.In vitro ,Y b h Ah a s phosphatase activity with PLP, erythrose-4-phosphate,fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, ﬂavin mononucleotide, thia- mine-pyrophosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, and ribose-5- phosphate.Nevertheless, among the examined substrates, the puri ﬁed enzyme shows the lowest Michaelis-Menten constant for PLP (76 ).In vivo , the overexpression of YbhA attenuates the inhibitory effect of PL on bacterial growth.
Conversely, overexpression of YbhA in cells g r o w ni nm i n i m a lm e d i u ml e a d st oar e d u c e dg r o w t hrate and decreased levels of intracellular PLP. This growthdefect can be rescued by addition of PL in the growth me- dium (19).Therefore, YbhA has been indicated as a spe- ciﬁcp h o s p h a t a s ef o rP L Pi n E.coli (Fig.2), whose activity balances the activity of the pyridoxal kinases PdxK and PdxY.Although its second preferred substrate is fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (76), YbhA does not seem to functionphysiologically as fructose 1,6- bisphosphatase.Thisproves that the primary role of YbhA is in PLPVitamin B6Metabolism in Escherichia coli EcoSalPlus.asm.org 13 homeostasis and not in the gluconeogenesis process (19).
This role was con ﬁrmed by the work of Kim et al., in which they found mutations in the ybhA g e n ei n9o ft h e 11 naturally selected DpdxB strains able to grow after 10 days in minimal medium, suggesting that in this back-ground, the loss of a PLP phosphatase would be advanta-geous (72). The pglgene, encoding the enzyme of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway 6-phosphogluconolacto- nase (UniProt P52697 ), is transcribed in the opposite direction from ybhA .Therefore, ybhA constitutes a sin- gle transcription unit (Fig.3I ).pdxIRecently, another component of the E.coli salvage path- way was identi ﬁed.It is the NADPH-dependent PL re- ductase encoded by pdxI (UniProt P25906 ), which converts PL into PN (Fig.2 ).
This enzyme, also known as pyridoxine 4 9-dehydrogenase, belongs to the aldo keto reductase family (AKR family) and was initially identi ﬁed in a large-scale metabolomics screen for enzy- matic activities of uncharacterized proteins (77).Evidence that PdxI is a PL reductase comes from a recent paper from Ito and Downs (22). These authors noticed that in a strain lacking pdxI, as well as two other genes involved in PLP production ( pdxJ andpdxH ), the amount of PN inside the cell was signi ﬁcantly lower and deduced from this observation that the externally supplemented PL was not converted into PN as in thewild-type strain (22).Kinetic characterization of B 6 vitamer ﬂuxes suggested that PdxI converts PL into PN and that the reduction of PL to PN is favored over the phosphorylation of PL to PLP.Therefore, following thissuggestion, in E.
coli , the conversion of externally supple- mented PL into PLP would preferably take place through a pathway involving PdxI (PL !PN!PNP!PLP) rather than a pathway involving PdxK and PdxY kinases(PL!PLP). The downstream gene ydbD encodes an uncharacter- ized protein probably involved in detoxi ﬁcation of methylglyoxal (UniProt P25907 ).The promoters of these two genes were only predicted, and it is stillunknown if the pdxI gene is transcribed as a single tran- scription unit or together with ydbD (Fig.3J ).A micro- array analysis indicated that transcription of pdxI is strongly activated by NsrR (78), but a subsequentchromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray tech- nology (ChIP-chip) experiment indicated an NsrR- binding site on the ydbD promoter (79).The transcrip- tional regulator NsrR controls the expression of genesencoding enzymes that reduce or oxidize NO in response to NO endogenously generated or produced by host cells.
PLP-Binding Proteins yggS The yggS gene (located at 3,095,098 to 3,095,802 kb) encodes a PLP-binding protein involved in PLP homeo- stasis renamed PLPHP (PLP homeostasis protein;UniProt P67080 ). PLPHP is widely distributed in bacte- ria and eukaryotes.The E.coli yggS mutant strain accu- mulates PNP, but not the other vitamers, and shows atoxicity ring when grown on solid medium containing an excess of exogenous PN (14 ).Moreover, with respect to the wild-type strain, the yggS deletion causes accu- mulation of metabolites, such as L-valine and 2-ketobu- tyrate, in the growth medium (13).Recently, it wasproposed that elevated levels of PNP caused by yggS de- letion perturb threonine and isoleucine/valine biosyn- thetic pathways, causing accumulation of metabolitessuch as L-valine that prevent bacterial growth (80).
Physical clustering associations, resulting from a com- parative genomic analysis, linked yggS to cell division and murein synthesis genes, as well as to PLP salvagepathway genes, and the glyA gene, coding for the PLP-de- pendent serine hydroxymethyltransferase enzyme (14). Nevertheless, in E.coli ,yggS may be the ﬁrst gene of a polycistronic operon ( yggSTU-rdgB-hemW ;F i g .3 K ) , although no correlation has been found between yggS and the downstream genes (13).Moreover, no experimental evidence of transcription of the yggS operon is present.The yggT gene encodes an integral membrane protein (UniProt P64564 ) probably involved in K1uptake.In fact, under hyperosmotic conditions, overexpression of yggT compensates for the growth defects of E.coli mutant cells lacking the major K1uptake systems (81 ).The yggU gene product is a small, uncharacterized protein (UniProt P52060 ).
RdgB, encoded by the downstream gene ( rdgB, also known as yggV ) is a nucleoside triphosphate pyro- phosphatase (UniProt P52061 ), which hydrolyzes dITP and XTP, mutagenic products of purine nucleotide deam- ination. RdgB may therefore remove misincorporatedTramonti et al.14 EcoSalPlus.asm.org bases, such as xanthine or hypoxanthine, from the pool of DNA precursors (82 ).Transcription of rdgB,t o g e t h e r with the downstream gene hemW , is also mediated by the alternative sigma factor s32, which governs the immedi- ate response to temperature stress (83).Moreover, under anaerobiosis, rdgB expression is repressed by FNR (fuma- rate and nitrate reduction regulatory protein), for which abinding site was identi ﬁed upstream of the gene.The hemW (also known as yggW ) gene codes for a heme chaperone (UniProt P52062 ).HemW is a radical SAM- family protein that appears to be able to transfer heme into enzymes of respiratory chains (84 ).
In the opposite direction with respect to the yggS-con- taining operon, there is the yggR gene encoding a puta- tive transporter annotated as the type II/IV secretion system family protein (UniProt P52052 ). Because the yggS andyggR start codons are only 17 bp apart, the two genes probably share a regulatory region in their re- spective promoters.MocR-Like Transcription Factors All bacteria, except Chlamydiae , possess MocR-like tran- scription factors (MocR-TFs), formed by the joining of a helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain and the proteinscaffold of fold type I PLP-dependent enzymes (6).MocR- TFs control several different metabolic processes involving vitamin B 6and amino acids (5).E.coli has been reported to contain two MocR-TFs (85) of unknown function, encoded by ydcR andyjiRgenes (Table 1).Unlike other well-studied MocR-TFs, i.e., Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium PtsJ, B.clausii ,L.
monocytogenes PdxR, and several others, in which the regulatory gene is adjacent tothe target gene (5), in the case of E. coli MocR-TFs, no pu- tative target gene involved in vitamin B 6biosynthesis and salvage pathways is located in close proximity.The ydcR gene is located between 1,510,003 and 1,511,409 kb in the E.coli genome.Downstream and in the same direction, there is the ydcSTUV-patD operon ( F i g .3 L ) .T h e ydcSTUV genes encode a putative ABC transporter for putrescine transport, though the major described putrescine transporter in E.coli is PuuP (86).In particular, YdcS constitutes the periplasmic binding protein; YdcT is the ATP-binding component, which may provide the driving force for putrescine transport,while YdcU and YdcV are the predicted inner membrane components of the ABC transporter.PatD, whose gene istranscribed from the ydcS promoter, encodes a g-amino- butyraldehyde dehydrogenase, belonging to one of the two pathways of putrescine degradation.
The ydcSTUV- patD operon is subject to the control of the stationary phase sigma factor sS, promoting transcription initiation from two sS-binding sites within the ydcS promoter. Moreover, expression is induced under nitrogen-limited growth conditions by the transcriptional regulator Nac, whereas putrescine does not exert any control (87).Theseobservations suggest that the ydcSTUV-patD operon is induced in response to several stresses in E.coli and do not indicate any possible involvement of the YdcR MocR-TF.The second gene encoding a MocR-TF in E.coli isyjiR, located between 4,570,162 and 4,571,574 kb, in an unex- plored region of the E.coli chromosome (Fig.3M).In fact, the adjacent yjiSgene encodes an uncharacterized small protein (UniProt P39390 ).In summary, considering all the operons containing genes involved in PLP metabolism, it may be assumed that the PLP biosynthesis and salvage pathways are strictly associated with primary metabolism of E.
coli .I n fact, as reported in Table 2, they are generally cotran-scribed with genes whose products are involved in gly- colysis, biosynthesis of amino acids, isoprenoids, fatty acid, RNA and DNA metabolism, and response to stress. STATE OF THE ART ON PLP METABOLISM REGULATION Transcriptional Regulation Despite the importance of PLP metabolism in E.coli , the transcriptional regulation of the involved genes is poorly understood.It is known that three global regula- tors are involved in the regulation of epd and serC expression.As the epdgene product is homologous to GAPDH, it is not a surprise that Cra and CRP areinvolved in its transcriptional regulation.The catabolite repressor-activator (Cra) protein controls the direction of carbon ﬂux by activating genes encoding enzymes involved in oxidative and gluconeogenic carbon ﬂow and by repressing genes concerned with the fermenta- tive carbon ﬂow (88).
On the other hand, the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is an important transcrip- tion factor that regulates transcription initiation ofmany genes required for energy production, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and ion transportVitamin B6Metabolism in Escherichia coli EcoSalPlus.asm.org 15 systems (89). In particular, the expression of epdis neg- atively affected by Cra, by binding at the 26/112 region of the epd promoter, and is activated by the CRP-cAMP regulator, which binds at the –81/–60 region.Both regulators are also involved in the tran- scriptional regulation of gapA (90), which can replace epdin its absence.The serC-aroA operon is repressed by the CRP-cAMP complex and is activated by the leu-cine-responsive global regulator Lrp, through theirbinding at speci ﬁc, conserved sequences of the pro- moter.Lrp regulates the expression of more than 40genes in E.coli , including several operons involved in amino acid biosynthesis (91).
The combined effect ofCRP and Lrp is to maximize the expression of the serC- aroA operon in cells growing in glucose-containing minimal medium, when a rapid synthesis of vitaminand metabolites is bene ﬁcial to cell growth, and toattenuate it in amino acid-rich media, where L-serine and B 6vitamers are present (45). It has been reported that the expression of the operons pdxA-rsmA-apaGH and pdxA-rms from P pdxA is posi- tively regulated by the growth rate through the Fis pro-tein (41).Although the exact location of the binding site of this regulator on the P pdxApromoter is unknown, the interaction with Fis was con ﬁrmed in a genome-wide analysis (92).Fis is a nucleoid-associated protein, whose deletion affects the transcription of 21% of E.coli genes.In the case of pdxA , it has been suggested that Fis is re- s p o n s i b l ef o rt h ep o s i t i v eg r o w t hr a t er e g u l a t i o n( 4 1 ) .
So far, no speci ﬁc transcriptional regulators of the genes involved in PLP biosynthesis and salvage pathways have been found in E.

The essential genes are highlighted in green.bn.r., not reported.Tramonti et al.16 EcoSalPlus.asm.org typhimurium , the expression of the pdxK gene is repressed from the MocR-like regulator PtsJ, whose gene is diver-gently transcribed from pdxK itself.PLP acts as an effector molecule of this regulator, because its binding to PtsJ induces a protein-conformational change that increasesafﬁnity for DNA and reinforces repression (93).As stated above, in several bacteria which synthesize PLP through the so-called DXP-independent pathway, the transcriptionof the pdxST operon encoding PLP synthase is regulated by another MocR-TF (PdxR) (7 –10).A similar transcrip- tional regulation of PLP biosynthesis has never been iden-tiﬁed in E.
coli , where the function of the two MocR-TFs present in the genome (Table 1) has never been identi ﬁed. We analyzed the promoter region of all the genes and operons involved in PLP biosynthesis and the salvagepathway (Supplemental Material) to check for the pres- ence of common motifs that may correspond to tran- scriptional regulation binding sites.A 13-bp conservedsequence was identi ﬁed in all the 18 promoter regions analyzed, with pdxJ,pdxK ,tyrS, and yjiR showing the highest scores (Fig.4).In most cases (11 out of 18), this consensus sequence encompasses the promoter region(235 hexamer, 210 hexamer, or 11 start site) or is located downstream of the transcription start site,suggesting that it may correspond to a repressor-bind- ing site.The actual role of this sequence in transcrip- tional regulation is far from being elucidated; however, the fact that it is present in the promoter region of both E.
coli MocR-TFs (YjiR being one of the targets with the highest scores indicated by the MEME tool) encourages an experimental investigation. Translational Regulation Although transcription represents the main point ofgene expression control in bacteria, regulation at the translational level also occurs (94, 95).Since transla- tional regulation is important especially in the expres- sion of genes forming operons, in which open reading frames (ORFs) are translated at different rates, this mode of regulation is expected to play a signi ﬁcant role in the expression of genes involved in the PLP biosyn- thetic pathway, such as the epd,pdxB ,pdxA , and pdxJ genes, which are members of complex operons.However, the actual translational control of these genes and the mo- lecular mechanism through which it may occur have not been characterized yet.
The epd,pdxB ,a n d pdxA genes contain infrequent and rare codons, suggesting that the mechanism of codon usage could negatively affect transla- tional rates and lead to low levels of the corresponding proteins (35, 36, 47). Moreover, two structural features related to the epd translation initiation region (TIR) cause the poor expression of its ORF.The ribonucleoti- des located upstream of the ribosome binding site (RBS) can form a stem-loop structure, and the distance between the RBS and the AUG start codon is unusually short, and it is evolutionarily conserved among epd ORFs (35).Furthermore, Roa et al.highlighted the fact that pdxA lacks a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the typical RBS of bac- teria.This may cause a minor af ﬁnity of the ribosome for the translational initiation site (47).Finally, the start codons of pdxB ,pdxA , and pdxJ ORFs are close to a conserved motif, ACGT(G/T)AAAATCC, named the “PDX box ”(36, 47, 64).
Notably, other PDX boxes were found within the pdxJ coding sequence. It has been proposed that this consensus motif might play a role in the regulation of translation, being rec- ognized by a speci ﬁc regulatory protein, or may form particular secondary structures affecting ribosome ac- tivity.De ﬁnitely, the translational regulation mediated by PDX boxes may represent a mechanism through FIG 4 Alignment of promoter regions containing the putative motif involved in the regulation of genes linked with PLP homeostasis.The promoter regions were analyzed using the MEME suitewebserver to identify a common motif.The orientations ( 1or–) of the promoter region and the score are reported.The logo of thesequence highlights conservation of the identi ﬁed motif.Vitamin B6Metabolism in Escherichia coli EcoSalPlus.asm.org 17 which the expression of pdxB ,pdxA ,a n d pdxJ is coor- dinated in the cell.
To summarize, the structural properties of epd,pdxB , pdxA , and pdxJ coding DNA sequences could limit their translation, allowing a differential expression withrespect to other coding sequences present in the samepolycistronic unit (Fig. 3).Cellular Levels of Proteins Involved in PLP Homeostasis The combined effect of regulation at transcriptional and translational levels determines the cellular content of pro-teins.Usually, proteins involved in a speci ﬁc process show similar abundance (96, 97).This seems to be not the caseof the proteins involved in vitamin B 6metabolism.In fact, we analyzed the results from two quantitative proteomicstudies, carried out on E.
coli lysates from cells collected at either the exponential (96) or stationary (97) phase, andalthough different experimental setups have been used in combination with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methodologies, we compared the copy num-ber per cell of proteins involved in PLP metabolism asdetermined in the two studies with respect to two house-keeping proteins, GyrB and RecA (98) (Table S1). Amongthe enzymes of PLP biosynthesis, the concentrations ofSerC and PdxJ are the highest in both proteomic analyses.In particular, in the exponential phase, SerC is 10-foldmore abundant than the housekeeping proteins and 8times more represented than PdxJ.This can be easilyrationalized by the fact that SerC is a key enzyme in L-ser- ine synthesis, as mentioned above.In the exponentialphase, the levels of PdxB, PdxH, PdxK, and PdxY arewithin the same order of magnitude.
In contrast, PdxAand Epd are the less abundant PLP biosynthesis proteins;this is probably a direct consequence of translational con-trol, negatively affecting the protein synthesis rate (seeprevious paragraph). The level of proteins decreases in thestationary phase compared to the exponential phase, withthe exception of PdxK and PdxH.This might be becausethe salvage pathway, in contrast with de novo biosynthesis, is essential during the stationary phase when PLP isrecycled from protein turnover.Enzyme Regulation Signiﬁcantly, the activity of some PLP biosynthesis and salvage enzymes is regulated by PLP itself.For example,PLP produced from the oxidation of PNP catalyzed by PNP oxidase (PdxH) tightly binds to an allosteric site causing the inhibition of the enzyme.An exhaustive char- acterization of this phenomenon has been recently carriedout by our group through kinetics and equilibrium bind-ing experiments (16).
A structural and functional connec- tion between the active site and the allosteric site has been proposed. PLP bound at the allosteric site causes the com-plete inactivation of the enzyme.However, this tightly b o u n dP L Pc a nb et r a n s f e r r e dt oP L P - d e p e n d e n te n z y m e s .In fact, when the PdxH-PLP complex was added to aPLP-dependent apoenzyme diluted in an E.coli cell extract, the rate of reactivation of the apoenzyme was sev- eralfold faster than when free PLP was added (99).In vitro studies of the puri ﬁed recombinant PdxK showed that the enzyme is inhibited by both its own substrate andproduct, PL and PLP, respectively.The mechanism of inhi-bition consists of the formation of a Schiff base between ei- ther PLP or PL and the Lys229 residue located close to the active site (17, 100).Concerning the binding of PLP, it wasdemonstrated that the inhibition occurs rapidly during thecatalytic turnover of the enzyme, when both PLP and MgADP are present.
The tightly bound PLP is protected from dephosphorylation by either a speci ﬁc PLP phospha- tase or alkaline phosphatase and cannot easily be removed. However, it can be transferred to PLP-dependent apoen- zymes with consequent reactivation of PdxK (17).In con-trast, inactivation by PL takes place before ATP is added toassay enzyme activity.PL initially binds very rapidly and noncovalently to the enzyme.In the absence of ATP, this noncovalent complex is slowly converted into a covalentSchiff base linkage between PL and Lys229.If ATP isa d d e d ,t h ee n z y m ei sa b l et oc a t a l y z eas i n g l et u r n o v e rc o n - version of this covalently bound PL to PLP (100).The crystal structure of the other PL kinase, PdxY, showed that the active site is ﬁlled with a density that ﬁts either PL or PLP.
In particular, in one of the mono- mers, the ligand appears to be covalently attached to a cysteine residue present at the active site as a thiohe- miacetal, while in the other monomer it is not cova-lently attached (74). It is very likely that as consequence of this binding inside the bacterial cell, the puri ﬁed PdxY appeared almost inactive (20).It is worth noticing that PLP is also dif ﬁcult to separate from the Pdx1 component of PLP synthase of the DXP-independent pathway of PLP biosynthesis.Indeed, itTramonti et al.18 EcoSalPlus.asm.org has been proposed that it is bound to the protein through a Schiff base (101).In all these enzymes, PLP plays a dual role: (i) modula- tion of enzyme activity, which is of physiological im-portance to keep the PLP concentration at anappropriate level, and (ii) storage of PLP, which is notreleased into the cellular environment, preventing spu- rious reactions with nonspeci ﬁc substrates, but that can be transferred to PLP-dependent apoenzymes.
CONCLUSION Vitamin B6 metabolism and PLP homeostasis arepoorly understood although they are crucial aspects ofbacterial metabolism, considering the importance ofthis vitamin in bacterial physiology and virulence. Theelucidation of vitamin B 6metabolism in bacteria may also be relevant to human health, since it may indicate novel targets of antimicrobial intervention.Moreover, the proteins involved in vitamin B 6metabolism also play pivotal roles in many human disorders, and manyaspects of bacterial vitamin B 6metabolism are similar in humans, as in the case of PNP oxidase and PLPHP(102, 103).Therefore, E.coli could be a useful model or- ganism to acquire information on the mechanisms ofregulation of vitamin B 6relevant to human health.SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL Supplemental material is available online only.TEXT S1 , DOCX ﬁle, 0.2 MB.FIG S1 , TIF ﬁle, 0.7 MB.FIG S2 , TIF ﬁle, 0.8 MB.TABLE S1 , DOCX ﬁle, 0.02 MB.
