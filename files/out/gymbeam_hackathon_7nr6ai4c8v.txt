Its fouling tendency is highly affected by the presence of ions and inorganics. While the effects of ions addition on organic fouling have been extensively researched in the past, studies on the effect of positively-charged inorganics, such as Fe2+and Mg2+, on organic fouling are limited.This study investigates the influence of Fe2+and Mg2+addition on fouling properties of the Suwannee River Organic Matter (SROM) solution in the MF process, with and without Ca2+ ions.Results showed that increasing the concentration of Fe2+and Mg2+from 0–5 mM promoted SROM fouling, and resulted in an increased flux decline up to 33% and 58%, respectively.Cake layer resistance became more dominant with the addition of Fe2+and Mg2+, and was counted for more than 60% of the fouling.Mg2+, however, caused higher internal pore blocking, and facilitated the formation of a less permeable cake layer, compared to Fe2+.
This was evident in the analysis of the cake layer properties and the visualization of the fouling layer. In all cases, SROM fouling with Fe2+ and Mg2+worsened with the addition of Ca2+ions.The results of the study indicated the importance of understanding the interaction between organic matter and Fe2+and Mg2+, which would provide useful insights on their fouling mechanism and control.Keywords: water treatment; membrane process; iron fouling; magnesium fouling; chemicals removal 1.Introduction Membranes have emerged as the treatment process of choice for drinking water pro- duction, and in many industrial applications.Membranes are effective in removing a wide range of water contaminants, such as organic substances, inorganics, and microorganisms, and in producing effluents that meet strict water quality standards [ 1,2].However, fouling remains a major challenge in membrane processes and their applications in water treat- ment.
Fouling is the deposition of water constituents such as organic matter, inorganics, microorganisms, etc., on the membrane surface or within membrane pores, which results in hindering its performance, reducing flux, and increasing the frequency of membrane cleaning and replacement. Over the past decades, great effort has been made to classify foulants according to their types, fouling mechanism, and control strategies in membrane processes [ 2–6].Some common foulant types include organics, inorganics, and colloids.Among these, organic and inorganic substances are the common contributors to membrane fouling during water and wastewater treatment.Organic matter, such as proteins, humic acids, and polysaccharides, have been iden- tified as essential membrane fouling substances in surface water, seawater, and various types of wastewater.
Organic substances generally carry a negative charge on their surfaces at neutral pH, and their fouling tendency is strongly dependent on various factors, such as organic type and concentration, the presence of inorganics and metal cations, pH, and temperature. Among these factors, the presence of inorganics and metal cations has been reported to have a great effect on organic fouling behavior [7–10].Inorganic colloidal substances, which are abundant in aquatic environments, including groundwater, surface water, seawater, and wastewater, contribute to membrane fouling.Membranes 2024 ,14, 150.https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes14070150 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/membranes Membranes 2024 ,14, 150 2 of 13 Negatively-charged inorganic colloids, such as silica, can cause many operational issues, in- cluding scaling, high-pressure drop, severe flux decline, and deterioration of the membrane separation performance [ 8,9,11].
Positively-charged inorganic colloids, such as aluminum, have been reported to elevate the severity of membrane fouling due to their higher affinity to adsorb negatively-charged organic substances, which leads to increased organic accumu- lation on the membrane surface, and flux decline [ 12,13]. Other studies also demonstrated the effect of inorganic substances on fouling irreversibility and membrane cleaning [ 14–16].Metal cations such as calcium (Ca2+) and sodium (Na+) have been reported to have a great effect on organic fouling behavior [ 10,17,18].A Ding et al.[ 17] study reported that increasing Ca2+concentration elevated protein fouling of an MF membrane system.Other studies [ 7–10] found that organic fouling can be aggravated by adding Ca2+and Na+.
A Ca2+and Na+presence can worsen fouling by neutralizing the charge on the organic matter surface and promoting their aggregation, which leads to higher organic matter deposition on the membrane surface, and hence, severe flux loss [10]. Although there are a good amount of studies on the effects of inorganic fouling and Ca2+ions on membrane fouling, the effect of positively-charged inorganic foulants such as Fe2+and Mg2+ions on organic matter fouling problems in membrane processes have been overlooked.Although both Fe2+and Mg2+are ubiquitous in water and present in surface waters, seawater, and various types of wastewater at a low concentration, which can be at a level of several ppm [ 18–21], limited effort has been made to understand Fe2+ and Mg2+‘s effect on membrane processes.For example, studies by Sioutopoulos et al.[ 22] and Davidkova et al.
[ 23] investigated iron fouling in RO and NF membranes, and found that the presence of Fe2+colloids enhanced fouling of the RO and NF membrane, and resulted in great flux decline. Moreover, in well-oxygenated waters, Fe2+can be easily converted to Fe3+, which can form insoluble colloids.These colloids can cause fouling problems if the membrane is not proceeded by the pretreatment stage; furthermore, if they are not removed, these insoluble colloids can build up on the membrane over time and decrease its operational life [ 23].A Xin et al.[ 24] study showed different results, in which reduced fouling of alginate at a high iron concentration was observed.However, the level of fouling was dependent on the concentration of alginate in the solution.Some other studies [ 17,25–27] investigated the effect of Mg2+on fouling in membrane processes; however, different outcomes were reported.For example, a study by Wang et al.
[ 26] reported that the addition of Mg2+ions aggravated polysaccharide fouling of the UF process. On the contrary, a study by Zou et al.[ 27] reported mitigated protein fouling with the addition of Mg2+ions.Previous studies also pointed out that Ca2+ions influence fouling of organic matter and enhance the formation of the compact fouling layer and higher surface roughness [ 23,25].The reported effect of Ca2+on fouling differs from Fe2+ and Mg2+.For example, a study by Wang et al.[ 25] showed that Ca2+has a higher charge neutralization capacity and more favorable binding ability compared to Mg2+.Other studies pointed out that the effect of Fe2+and Mg2+on the fouling behavior of sodium alginate was different from that of Ca2+due to the large hydration radius of Fe2+and Mg2+[21,24], underlining the need for more research in this area.
While the previous limited studies have pointed out the effect of inorganics on mem- brane fouling, more research is needed to understand the effect of positively-charged inorganics such as Ca2+, Fe2+, and Mg2+on organic matter fouling behavior. Since the aforementioned positively-charged inorganics and negatively-charged organic matter can co-exist in various types of water, their interactions and combined effect on membrane fouling needs further exploration.Therefore, this study aims to investigate the influence of Fe2+and Mg2+on fouling properties of organic matter solution in membrane processes.Suwannee River Organic Matter (SROM) was used as the model of organic foulant.The fouling layer formed from the tested solutions with various SROM and Fe2+and Mg2+ concentrations, with and without Ca2+ions, was examined under constant pressure dead- end microfiltration (MF).
The performance of the MF membrane, with regard to fouling mechanism, was assessed through permeability, fouling resistances, zeta potential, fouling Membranes 2024 ,14, 150 3 of 13 layer properties, and analysis of the formed fouling layer. This study provides insights into Fe2+and Mg2+effect on organic fouling in a membrane filtration process, which would be useful for fouling control and membrane operation optimization.2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Feed Solution Preparation and Characterization The feed solutions were prepared using SROM (International Humic Substances Soci- ety) as the model of organic matter.Then, 20 mg/L of SROM was prepared by dissolving the powdered SROM in pure Milli-Q water (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and stir- ring for at least 24 h prior to experiment at room temperature.Stock solutions of Fe2+ (FeCl 3·6H2O; Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA) and Mg (MgCl 2·6H2O; Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA) were prepared.
Fe2+and Mg2+were added by pipetting different concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mM into the prepared SROM solution. The Fe2+and Mg2+concentrations have been selected based on previous studies [ 24,26].For the case of studying the effect of Ca2+, 1 mM of CaCl 2was added to the SROM solution, followed by the addition of the desired amount of Fe2+and Mg2+under continuous mixing.The solution’s pH was controlled around pH 7.2 using NaOH prior to filtration.The zeta potential and particle size of SROM solutions with different Fe2+and Mg2+ concentrations, with and without Ca2+ions, were measured using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK).In brief, SROM solution (or in some cases, SROM and Ca2+solution) was stirred overnight.The zeta potential and size of the SROM solution were measured using the Malvern Zetasizer Nano before and after Fe2+or Mg2+ addition.pH values of the sample were measured and adjusted as required.
Each measure- ment was repeated at least 3 times, and average values were reported. 2.2.Filtration Tests Fouling experiments were performed on a laboratory dead-end filtration setup.The setup included a stirred filtration cell reservoir (Merck, Burlington, MA, USA), a nitrogen tank to provide the required filtration pressure, and a filtrate beaker placed on a digital balance (OHAUS, Parsippany, NJ, USA).A flat sheet-regenerated cellulose MF membrane (Millipore Co., USA.) with a pore size of 0.1 µm was used.The MF membrane was cleaned with Milli-Q water for at least 24 h before the experiment.Milli-Q water was then passed through the membrane at a set pressure of 1 bar to stabilize the permeate flux, and to determine the intrinsic membrane resistance (R m).For fouling experiments, the SROM solution with the desired Fe2+and Mg2+concentration, with and without Ca2+ions, was then filtered under a filtration pressure of 1 bar, which was provided by the nitrogen gas.
Each fouling experiment was conducted for 180 min (3 h.) at room temperature (22◦C). Filtrate water was then collected in a beaker on a digital balance.The volume of the filtrate water was recorded every 20 s by the balance, which was connected to a personal computer.Fouled membranes were then removed from the filtration cell for analysis.New fresh membrane was used in each experiment.2.3.Fouling Mechanism Analysis 2.3.1.Estimation of Fouling Resistances Membrane flux (J) during filtration can be defined as the relationship between applied pressure ( ∆p), total filtration resistance (R t), and water viscosity ( µ) (Equation (1)).R t during the filtration of SROM with Fe2+and Mg2+, with and without, Ca2+ions was determined using the resistance in series model [ 28].R t(Equation (2)) was divided into intrinsic (clean) membrane resistance (R m); pore blocking resistance (R pp); and cake layer resistance (R cl).
J=∆P µRt(1) Rt= R m+ R cl+ R pp (2) Membranes 2024 ,14, 150 4 of 13 Rmwas estimated before and between experiments using Equation (1), by filtering Milli-Q water through a clean filter at constant pressure at room temperature, and then recording the J for at least 60 min. R twas determined using flux and pressure data during fouling experiments.After the filtration period (i.e., 180 min), fouled membranes were gently cleaned and rinsed with Milli-Q water to remove the cake layer.Milli-Q water was then filtered to determine the R pp.Rclwas then back-calculated using the difference between the R t, Rpp, and R m, as shown in Equation (2).Where J is in (m/s); R t, Rm, Rcl, and Rppare in (m−1);∆P is in (Pa); and µis in (Pa s).The changes in flux and pressure data with time were used to calculate the fouling resistances.2.3.2.
Fouling Layer Properties A specific cake resistance αc(m/gC) and cake compressibility index (n) analysis of the foulant layer was conducted to evaluate the changes in properties of the membrane surface structure and foulant layer at the tested conditions [ 29,30].αcis a function of the cake layer resistance (R c), particle concentration, C b(kg/m3), and the filtered water volume, V s (m3/m2), as shown in Equation (3). αc=Rc Cb Vs(3) Theαcincreases according to a power law (Equation (4)), in which a function of the applied pressure ( ∆P) and the properties of particles form the cake ( α0) [29,30], as shown in Equation (4).The n was then determined as follows, by plotting the αcand∆P: αc=α0×∆Pn(4) 2.3.3.SEM Imaging To gain further insights on the fouling layer formed by SROM and Fe2+and Mg, with and without Ca ions, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was conducted on the fouled membranes.SEM images were taken using the Tescan Vega-II XMU equipment (War- rendale, PA, USA).
Fouled membranes were placed overnight to dry at room temperature prior to SEM analysis. 3.Results and Discussion 3.1.Characterization of SROM Feed Solution with Different Fe2+and Mg2+Concentrations 3.1.1.Zeta Potential of Feed Solutions Figure 1 presents the zeta potentials of SROM solutions with different Fe2+and Mg2+ concentrations, with and without the Ca2+addition.It can be seen that, for SROM solution alone, the zeta potential value was negative, −55.5 mV , indicating that SROM particles were stable and had less tendencies of aggregation.With the addition of Fe2+to SROM (Figure 1a), the zeta potentials of the mixture solution became less negative (i.e., less stable), and values increased moderately from increasing the Fe2+concentration from 0.5–10 mM, which reached –38.2 mV at 20 mg/L of SROM and 10 mM of Fe2+.
The addition of Mg2+to the SROM solution (Figure 1b), however, showed a significant increase in the zeta potential values; that is, the addition of 0.5 mM of Mg2+resulted in a zeta potential of −40.6 mM, and values increased from increasing the Mg2+concentration from 0.5–10 mM, which reached –8.8 mV at 20 mg/L of SROM and 10 mM of Mg2+. These results indicate that although both Fe2+and Mg2+reduced the negative charge on the SROM, the zeta potentials of the SROM solution were dependent on the level of the Fe2+and Mg2+addition; that is, the SROM net charge was neutralized with the increase of the Fe2+and Mg2+concentration.Mg2+ions have a more pronounced effect on the zeta potential of SROM compared to Fe2+, resulting in less stable SROM.A study by Xin et al.[ 23] reported that there was little effect of the Fe2+addition on the zeta potential of alginate solution.
This could be attributed to Membranes 2024 ,14, 150 5 of 13 the different model of organic matter used, and the low concentration range of Fe2+used in that study. In another study by Davidkova et al.[ 22], the addition of organic to iron oxide solution resulted in a surface charge reversal from positive to negative, which led to higher fouling and flux decline.The MF membrane surface used in this study had a negative zeta potential; thus, it is expected that electrostatic repulsion between the MF membrane surface and the SROM will be reduced from increasing the Fe2+and Mg2+concentration, suggesting a higher tendency for SROM to deposit on the membrane surface, and thus, higher fouling.Membranes 2024 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 13 of the SROM solution were dependent on the level of the Fe2+ and Mg2+ addition; that is, the SROM net charge was neutralized with the increase of the Fe2+ and Mg2+ concentration.
Mg2+ ions have a more pronounced e ﬀect on the zeta potential of SROM compared to Fe2+, resulting in less stable SROM. A study by Xin et al.[23] reported that there was li ttle eﬀect of the Fe2+ addition on the zeta potential of alginate solution.This could be a ttributed to the diﬀerent model of organic ma tter used, and the low concentration range of Fe2+ used in that study.In another study by Davidkova et al.[22], the addition of organic to iron oxide solution resulted in a surface charge re versal from positive to negative, which led to higher fouling and ﬂux decline.The MF membrane surface used in this study had a negative zeta potential; thus, it is expect ed that electrostatic repulsion between the MF membrane surface and the SROM will be reduced from increasing the Fe2+ and Mg2+ con- centration, suggesting a higher tendency for SROM to deposit on the membrane surface, and thus, higher fouling.
Figure 1 also shows the e ﬀect of the Ca2+ addition on the zeta potentials of the SROM solution. The addition of 1 mM Ca2+ increased the zeta potentials’ values by approximately 30% for the tested SROM solution.Similar to the case without Ca2+ (as shown in Figure 1a,b), a further Fe2+ and Mg2+ addition had a pronounced e ﬀect on the zeta potential val- ues, resulting in less stable particles.Previous studies [23,31–33] have reported that cati- ons can neutralize the surface charge of organic ma tter and promote their fouling ten- dency, which is aligned with the results here.Figure 1.Zeta potentials of SROM solution with di ﬀerent Fe2+ and Mg2+ concentrations, with and without Ca2+ addition.a) SROM + Fe2+; b) SROM + Mg2+ 3.1.2.Particle Size Analysis of Feed Solutions Figure 2 illustrates the e ﬀect of the Fe2+ and Mg2+ addition on the particle size of SROM, with and without the Ca2+ a d d i t i o n .
A s s h o w n i n F i g u r e 2 , t h e p a r t i c l e s i z e o f SROM alone increased from 0.22–20.6 µm as a result of increasing Fe2+ concentration from Figure 1. Zeta potentials of SROM solution with different Fe2+and Mg2+concentrations, with and without Ca2+addition.( a) SROM + Fe2+; (b) SROM + Mg2+.Figure 1 also shows the effect of the Ca2+addition on the zeta potentials of the SROM solution.The addition of 1 mM Ca2+increased the zeta potentials’ values by approximately 30% for the tested SROM solution.Similar to the case without Ca2+(as shown in Figure 1a,b), a further Fe2+and Mg2+addition had a pronounced effect on the zeta potential values, resulting in less stable particles.Previous studies [ 23,31–33] have reported that cations can neutralize the surface charge of organic matter and promote their fouling tendency, which is aligned with the results here.3.1.2.
Particle Size Analysis of Feed Solutions Figure 2 illustrates the effect of the Fe2+and Mg2+addition on the particle size of SROM, with and without the Ca2+addition. As shown in Figure 2, the particle size of SROM alone increased from 0.22–20.6 µm as a result of increasing Fe2+concentration from 0–0.5 mM , and continued to increase to 210.3 µm when the Fe2+concentration increased to 10 mM.Unlike Fe2+, the addition of up to 1 mM of Mg2+resulted in almost no observed particle size growth (i.e., SROM size only increased from 0.22–3.1 µm at 0 and 1 mM of Mg2+).However, from increasing Mg2+concentration to 2 mM, a significant increase in the size of the SROM particles was observed, which reached 14.8 µm and continued to increase Membranes 2024 ,14, 150 6 of 13 to34.2µmwhen the Mg2+concentration increased to 10 mM.With the addition of 1 mM of Ca2+, and in the absence of Fe2+and Mg2+, the size of SROM particles was increased to 2.6µm, which was almost similar to that of 1 mM of Mg2+alone.
The addition of Ca2+to the SROM solution at 0.5 mM of Fe2+and Mg2+formed large particles and continued to increase to 277.1 and 76.3 µm when the Fe2+and Mg2+concentration increased to 10 mM , respectively. It was previously reported that both zeta potential and particle size play an important role in membrane fouling and performance [ 23,34,35].While zeta potential determines the tendency of particles to aggregate and grow, particle size determines how particles accumulate on the membrane surface (i.e., internally or externally).Smaller particles tend to accumulate within the membrane pores or block the pores completely, whereas large particles accumulate externally on the membrane surface and form a cake layer [ 13,36].
According to the zeta potential values in Figure 1 and the particle size change in Figure 2, it can be suggested that with the addition of Fe2+and Mg2+at different concentrations to the SROM, with and without Ca2+ions, the SROM became less stable, with larger particle sizes compared to the SROM alone. These two characteristics are expected to influence the SROM filtration performance and fouling behavior.It is worth pointing out that in this study, all testing was conducted at room temperature (22◦C); thus, the effect of viscosity on the adhesion behavior of the pollutants was negligible.Additionally, Xin et al.’s [ 24] study reported minimal changes in solution viscosity with changing alginate and iron concentration.Membranes 2024 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 13 0–0.5 mM, and continued to increase to 210.3 µm when the Fe2+ concentration increased to 10 mM.
Unlike Fe2+, the addition of up to 1 mM of Mg2+ resulted in almost no observed particle size growth (i.e., SROM size only increased from 0.22–3.1 µm at 0 and 1 mM of Mg 2+). However, from increasing Mg2+ concentration to 2 mM, a signi ﬁcant increase in the size of the SROM particles was observed, which reached 14.8 µm and continued to in- crease to 34.2 µm when the Mg2+ concentration increased to 10 mM.With the addition of 1 mM of Ca2+, and in the absence of Fe2+ and Mg2+, the size of SROM particles was increased to 2.6 µm, which was almost similar to that of 1 mM of Mg2+ alone.The addition of Ca2+ to the SROM solution at 0.5 mM of Fe2+ and Mg2+ formed large particles and continued to increase to 277.1 and 76.3 µm when the Fe2+ and Mg2+ concentration increased to 10 mM, respectively.It was previously reported that both zeta potential and particle size play an important role in membrane fouling and performance [23,34,35].
While zeta potential de- termines the tendency of particles to aggr egate and grow, particle size determines how particles accumulate on the membrane surface (i.e., internally or externally). Smaller par- ticles tend to accumulate within the memb rane pores or block the pores completely, whereas large particles accumulate externally on the membrane surface and form a cake layer [13,36].According to the zeta potential values in Figure 1 and the particle size change in Figure 2, it can be suggested that with the addition of Fe 2+ and Mg2+ at diﬀerent concen- trations to the SROM, with and without Ca2+ ions, the SROM became less stable, with larger particle sizes compared to the SROM al one.These two characteristics are expected to inﬂuence the SROM ﬁltration performance and fouling behavior.It is worth pointing out that in this study, all testing was conducted at room temperature (22 °C); thus, the eﬀect of viscosity on the adhesion behavior of the pollutants was negligible.
Additionally, Xin et al.’s [24] study reported minimal change s in solution viscosity with changing algi- nate and iron concentration. Figure 2.Particle size of the SROM solution with di ﬀerent Fe2+ and Mg2+ concentrations, with and without Ca2+ addition.a) SROM + Fe2+; b) SROM + Mg2+ 3.2.Eﬀect of Fe2+ and Mg2+ Concentration on the Filtration Performance of SROM Figure 3a–d present the membrane permeability pro ﬁles during ﬁltration of SROM with Fe2+ and Mg2+, with and without Ca2+.The results of Fe2+ and Mg2+ concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, and 5 mM were presented here as examples.As can be seen in Figure 3a, the ﬁltration of SROM alone caused an immediate decline in membrane permeability within the ﬁrst 30–60 min, and reached a ratio of 0.87, which remained unchanged for the remain- ing ﬁltration period.
The addition of 0.5 mM of Fe2+ to the SROM solution resulted in a moderate decline in permeability, which reached a ratio of 0.81 (6% decline) at the end of the ﬁltration period (i.e., 180 min) . Furthermore, increasing the Fe2+ concentration to 1 and 5 mM resulted in a 20% and 33% decline in permeability, which reached a ratio of 0.68 Figure 2.Particle size of the SROM solution with different Fe2+and Mg2+concentrations, with and without Ca2+addition.( a) SROM + Fe2+; (b) SROM + Mg2+.3.2.Effect of Fe2+and Mg2+Concentration on the Filtration Performance of SROM Figure 3a–d present the membrane permeability profiles during filtration of SROM with Fe2+and Mg2+, with and without Ca2+.The results of Fe2+and Mg2+concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, and 5 mM were presented here as examples.
As can be seen in Figure 3a, the filtration of SROM alone caused an immediate decline in membrane permeability within the first 30–60 min, and reached a ratio of 0.87, which remained unchanged for the remaining filtration period. The addition of 0.5 mM of Fe2+to the SROM solution resulted in a moderate decline in permeability, which reached a ratio of 0.81 (6% decline) at the end of the filtration period (i.e., 180 min).Furthermore, increasing the Fe2+concentration to 1 and 5 mM resulted in a 20% and 33% decline in permeability, which reached a ratio of 0.68 and 0.52, respectively.The decline in membrane permeability with increasing Fe2+concentration could be attributed to the reduced negative charge of the surface of SROM with the Fe2+addition, which may have enhanced fouling.This is aligned with other studies that reported increased fouling with increasing positively-charged ions in water [22,23].
Unlike Fe2+, the addition of 0.5 mM of Mg2+to the SROM (Figure 3c) resulted in a much faster and sharper decline in permeability, which resulted in a final ratio of 0.66 (24% decline). Moreover, increasing the Mg2+concentration to 1 and 5 mM decreased Membranes 2024 ,14, 150 7 of 13 permeability by 45% and 58%, which reached a value of 0.47 and 0.36.The fouling trend for SROM in the presence of Mg2+is similar to that for Fe2+; however, the level of permeability decline differs.As shown in the zeta potential results, the Mg2addition significantly reduced the negative surface charge of the SROM, which promoted its deposition on the membrane surface and within its pores.The particle size of the Mg2+was smaller than that of Fe2+, which may cause an internal pore fouling, followed by the formation of a less permeable cake layer.This resulted in the sharp decline in permeability compared to that of Fe2+.
The effect of particle surface charge and size on fouling was also reported in other studies [13,22,36]. Membranes 2024 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 13 and 0.52, respectively.The decline in membrane permeability with increasing Fe2+ concen- tration could be a ttributed to the reduced negative char ge of the surface of SROM with the Fe2+ addition, which may have enhanced fouling.This is aligned with other studies that reported increased fouling with increasing positively-charged ions in water [22,23].Unlike Fe2+, the addition of 0.5 mM of Mg2+ to the SROM (Figure 3c) resulted in a much faster and sharper decline in permeability, which resulted in a ﬁnal ratio of 0.66 (24% decline).Moreover, increasing the Mg2+ concentration to 1 and 5 mM decreased per- meability by 45% and 58%, which reached a value of 0.47 and 0.36.The fouling trend for SROM in the presence of Mg 2+ is similar to that for Fe2+; however, the level of permeability decline di ﬀers.
As shown in the zeta potential results, the Mg2 addition signi ﬁcantly re- duced the negative surface charge of the SROM, which promoted its deposition on the membrane surface and within its pores. The particle size of the Mg2+ was smaller than that of Fe2+, which may cause an internal pore fouling, followed by the formation of a less per- meable cake layer.This resulted in the shar p decline in permeability compared to that of Fe2+.The eﬀect of particle surface charge and size on fouling was also reported in other studies [13,22,36].Figure 3b,d show the e ﬀect of the Ca2+ addition on the ﬁltration pro ﬁle of the SROM solution with Fe2+ and Mg2+.It showed that the addition of 1 mM Ca2+ to SROM alone (i.e., in the absence of Fe2+ and Mg2+) enhanced fouling and permeability decline by approxi- mately 28%, which reached a ﬁnal ratio of 0.63.
The fouling behavior of the SROM with Ca2+ was expected, as Ca2+ ions can promote the aggregation of organic particles through surface neutralization [23,37]. Similar to the case without Ca2+, further Fe2+ and Mg2+ addi- tions had a pronounced e ﬀect on the SROM fouling behavior and permeability decline; that is, the SROM fouling with Fe2+ and Mg2+ worsened in the presence of Ca2+ ions (as shown in Figure 3b,d).Membrane permeability in the presence of Ca2+ ions, declined by 17–55% and 44–78% from increasing the Fe2+ and Mg2+ concentration from 0.5–5 mM, re- spectively.Therefore, analysis of the SROM fouling resistance and foulant layer with Fe2+ and Mg2+, with and without Ca2+ ions, was needed to understand the fouling mechanism.Figure 3.SROM ﬁltration pro ﬁles at diﬀerent Fe2+ and Mg2+ concentrations.( a) SROM + Fe2+; (b) SROM + Fe2+ + Ca2+; (c) SROM + Mg2+; (d) SROM + Mg2+ + Ca2+.3.3.Analysis of SROM Fouling with Di ﬀerent Fe2+ and Mg2+ Concentrations Figure 3.

Membrane permeability in the presence of Ca2+ions, declined by 17–55% and 44–78% from increasing the Fe2+and Mg2+concentration from 0.5–5 mM, respectively. Therefore, analysis of the SROM fouling resistance and foulant layer with Fe2+and Mg2+, with and without Ca2+ions, was needed to understand the fouling mechanism.3.3.Analysis of SROM Fouling with Different Fe2+and Mg2+Concentrations 3.3.1.Cake Layer and Pore Blocking Resistances Figure 4a–d illustrate the fouling resistance ratios due to pore blocking (R pp) and the cake layer (R cl) during filtration of SROM with different Fe2+and Mg2+concentrations (using 0, 0.5, 1, and 5 mM as examples), with and without Ca2+ions.Results showed that for the filtration of SROM only, 75% of fouling was due to pore blocking, whereas the remaining 25% was due to cake filtration (Figure 4a,c).However, with the addition of 0.5 mM of Fe2+or Mg2+, the cake fouling resistance ratio increased to Membranes 2024 ,14, 150 8 of 13 60% and 48%, respectively.
As a result of increasing the Fe2+and Mg2+concentration from 0.5 mM to 5 mM, cake resistance became more dominant, and was responsible for more than 75% and 60% of the fouling for Fe2+and Mg2+, respectively. Although the fouling resistance trends of Fe2+and Mg2+were similar, Mg2+caused a higher degree of pore blocking compared to Fe2+, which explains the higher permeability decline caused by Mg2+.These results are aligned with the permeability decline results presented in Figure 3.Membranes 2024 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 13 Figure 4.Fouling resistances of SROM during ﬁltration with di ﬀerent concentrations of Fe2+ and Mg2+.(a) SROM + Fe2+; (b) SROM + Fe2+ + Ca2+; (c) SROM + Mg2+; (d) SROM + Mg2+ +Ca2+.3.3.2.Fouling Layer Properties Tables 1 and 2 present the fouling layer prop erties of the model foulants used in this study.The speci ﬁc cake resistance ( αc) and the cake compressibility index (n) were deter- mined using Equations (3) and (4).
The αc caused by SROM alone was 1.56 × 103, with a low n value of 0.28. This indicates that the fouling layer formed by SROM was mo re porous, with an open structure, which agrees with the slower decline in membrane permeability (Figure 3).Increasing the con-centration of Fe 2+ in the solution from 0.5–5 mM resulted in an increase in the cake re- sistance, and a more compressible cake layer.Similarly, increasing the concentration of Mg2+ in the solution from 0.5–5 mM resulted in a signi ﬁcant increase in the cake resistance, and a highly compressible cake layer.The addition of Mg2+ to SROM had a relatively higher eﬀect on the cake layer properties compared to Fe2+.This could be related to the small particle size of Mg2+ compared to Fe2+, which may cause internal pore blocking and facilitate the formation of a less permeable cake layer.Tables 1 and 2 also show the e ﬀect of the Ca2+ addition on the cake layer properties of the SROM solution with Fe2+ and Mg2+.
The addition of 1 mM Ca2+ to SROM alone (i.e., in the absence of Fe2+ and Mg2+) increased αc and n values almost 2-fold, compared to SROM alone. Other studies [13,23,38–40] have reported the Ca2+ eﬀect on the cake layer Figure 4.Fouling resistances of SROM during filtration with different concentrations of Fe2+and Mg2+.(a) SROM + Fe2+; (b) SROM + Fe2++ Ca2+; (c) SROM + Mg2+; (d) SROM + Mg2++Ca2+.Figure 4b,d show the effect of the Ca2+addition on the fouling resistances of the SROM solution with Fe2+and Mg2+.Results showed that the addition of 1 mM Ca2+to SROM alone (i.e., in the absence of Fe2+and Mg2+) enhanced the cake resistance ratio by almost 35%, compared to SROM alone.The fouling behavior of SROM with Ca2+was expected, considering that Ca2+ions aggregated with SROM and increased their particle size, which may have resulted in higher cake layer formation.This was evident in the particle size analysis, and in the filtration profiles of SROM (Figures 2 and 3).
Additionally , in the presence of Ca2+, further Fe2+and Mg2+additions had a pronounced effect on the SROM fouling resistances; that is, the SROM fouling due to cake filtration increased with Fe2+and Mg2+with Ca2+ions (as shown in Figure 4b,d). The fouling ratio due to cake formation in the presence of Ca2+ ions, increased by 35–50% and 20–38% from increasing Fe2+and Mg2+concentrations from 0.5–5 mM, respectively .The changes in SROM fouling resistance with Fe2+and Mg2+in the presence of Ca2+indicated the importance of altering membrane backwash and cleaning procedures based on feed water composition to control fouling and improve permeability .Membranes 2024 ,14, 150 9 of 13 3.3.2.Fouling Layer Properties Tables 1 and 2 present the fouling layer properties of the model foulants used in this study.The specific cake resistance ( αc) and the cake compressibility index (n) were determined using Equations (3) and (4).Table 1.SROM fouling layer properties with Fe2+, with and without Ca2+.

Increasing the concentration of Fe2+in the solution from 0.5–5 mM resulted in an increase in the cake resistance, and a more compressible cake layer. Similarly, increasing the concentration of Mg2+in the solution from 0.5–5 mM resulted in a significant increase in the cake resistance, and a highly compressible cake layer.The addition of Mg2+to SROM had a relatively higher effect on the cake layer properties compared to Fe2+.This could be related to the small particle size of Mg2+compared to Fe2+, which may cause internal pore blocking and facilitate the formation of a less permeable cake layer.Tables 1 and 2 also show the effect of the Ca2+addition on the cake layer properties of the SROM solution with Fe2+and Mg2+.The addition of 1 mM Ca2+to SROM alone (i.e., in the absence of Fe2+and Mg2+) increased αcand n values almost 2-fold, compared to SROM alone.
Other studies [ 13,23,38–40] have reported the Ca2+effect on the cake layer structure and fouling irreversibility, which is aligned with the results of this study. Additionally, in the presence of Ca2+, further Fe2+and Mg2+additions had a pronounced effect on the SROM fouling layer properties; that is, the αcof SROM increased with Fe2+and Mg2+in the presence of Ca2+ions (as shown in Tables 1 and 2).n value increased 1.5–2.5-fold from increasing the Fe2+and Mg2+concentration from 0.5–5 mM, with and without Ca2+ions.Membranes 2024 ,14, 150 10 of 13 3.3.3.SEM Analysis of Fouled Membranes SEM image analyses were performed to gain a deep understanding of the fouling layer formed on the membrane surface.Figure 5 shows a clean membrane surface compared to the fouled surface (using 5 mM of Fe2+and Mg2+as examples).In the case of filtration of SROM alone (Figure 5b), the fouling layer formed was thin and loose with noticeable open pores.
The SROM alone, due to its small size, formed a thin cake layer with an open structure, which indicates that SROM may cause internal pore fouling. This is in agreement with the filtration resistance analysis (refer to Figure 4), which showed a higher percentage of pore blocking in the case of SROM filtration alone.In the case of filtration of SROM with Fe2+(Figure 4c), a noticeable thick and compact gel layer was formed, wherein decreased open pores were observed, compared to that of SROM alone.This indicated that with the addition of Fe2+to SROM, fouling transitioned from pore blocking to cake formation, which was consistent with the fouling resistance’s analysis in Figure 4.Moreover, this was reflected in the increased decline in membrane permeability with the Fe2+addition (Figure 3).
Similarly , the addition of Mg2+affected the fouling layer structure of SROM, as the fouling layer became extraordinary different, with a much denser structure and almost no visible open pores on the surface (Figure 5e). This was consistent with the results of fouling resistance and permeability decline, which also showed the role of Mg2+in facilitating a combination of pore blocking and cake layer formation.The addition of Ca2+ions worsens the fouling layer of SROM with Fe2+and Mg2+(as shown in Figure 5d,f), which demonstrates the profound effect of Ca2+on fouling formation and membrane permeability .Membranes 2024 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 13 (as shown in Figure 5d,f), which demonstrates the profound e ﬀect of Ca2+ on fouling for- mation and membrane permeability.Figure 5.SEM images of membrane surface.( a) Clean membrane; ( b) SROM; ( c) SROM + 5 mM Fe2+; (d) SROM + 5 mM Fe2+ + 1 mM Ca2+; (e) SROM + 5 mM Mg2+; (f) SROM + 5 mM Mg2+ + 1 mM Ca2+.4.
Conclusions This study investigated the in ﬂuence of Fe2+ and Mg2+ additions on fouling properties of the SROM solution in the MF process, with and without Ca2+ ions. Key ﬁndings were as follows: • Fe2+ and Mg2+ ions have a pronounced e ﬀect of the zeta potential of SROM, which resulted in less stable particles.• Increasing the concentration of Fe2+ and Mg2+ from 0–5 mM promoted SROM fouling, and resulted in an increased ﬂux decline of up to 33% and 58%, respectively.• For SROM only, 75% of fouling was due to pore blocking, whereas the remaining 25% was due to cake ﬁltration.The cake layer resistance became more dominant with the addition of Fe2+ and Mg2+, and was responsible for more than 60% of the fouling.Mg2+, however, caused higher internal pore blocking and facilitated the formation of a less permeable cake layer compared to Fe2+.This was evident in the analysis of the cake layer properties and the visu alization of the fouling layer.
• In all cases, SROM fouling with Fe2+ and Mg2+ worsened in the presence of Ca2+ ions due to charge neutralization and aggregation of SROM; hence, it has a high fouling tendency.
