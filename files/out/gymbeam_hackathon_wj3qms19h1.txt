For this purpose, one hundred 8-day-old broiler chicks of both sexes were divided into four groups ( n= 25 in each group).Chicks in the ﬁrst group served as the negative control (non-treated–non-infected).Chicks in the second group were challenged at 18 days old with 5 ×104E.tenella sporulated oocysts.The third group was challenged with 5 ×104sporulated E.tenella oocysts at 18 days old after receiving spinach extract at a dose of 50 mg/kg at 8 days old.The fourth group received 0.2 mg/kg diclazuril (Coxiril®0.2%) in their diet two days before being orally infected with 5 ×104sporulated E.tenella oocysts and this continued till day 10 post-infection (PI).
The growth performance, clinical symptoms, oocyst shedding, histological ﬁndings, and biochemical parameters were used to evaluate the efﬁcacy on day 8 PI when the infection was at its peak. A gas chromatography examination revealed that omega-3 fatty acids were the main constituents of the spinach extract, followed by oleic acid, palmitic acid, and phytol, with amounts of 23.37%, 17.53%, 11.26%, and 7.97%, respectively.The in vitro investigation revealed that the spinach extract at concentrations of 10% and 5% inhibited the oocyst sporulation by 52.1% and 45.1%, respectively.The 5% concentration was selected for the in vivo trial based on the results of thein vitro study.The infected–untreated group showed high levels of OPG; lower body weight; a greater number of parasite stages; few goblet cells; decreased SOD, CAT, and GPX levels; and increased MDA and NO levels.
The spinach-treated group, on the other hand, showed a signiﬁcant decrease in oocyst output per gram of feces (OPG), increased body weight, decreased parasitic stages, and a nearly normal number of goblet cells. Additionally, it reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), while increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX).In conclusion, spinach produced signiﬁcant antioxidant effects, increased body weight, reduced the number of oocysts and parasite stages in the caecum, and restored the number of goblet cells relative to those of an uninfected control.Furthermore, spinach extract inhibits the sporulation percentage ofE.tenella oocysts.The ethanolic extract of S.oleracea (whole plant) contained high concentrations of fatty acids, palmitic acid, Phytol, betulin, and ursolic aldehyde, all of which are known to regulate the antioxidant pathway and modulate inﬂammatory processes and may be the main reason for its anticoccidial activity.

[ 2], there are losses in a variety of poultry categories that vary from USD 104.74 to USD 2,750,779.00 due to the expense of the vaccine, treatment, and other preventative measures. There are several drugs available to treat coccidiosis; however, their overuse has hastened the development of multidrug resistance and increased the residue in tissues.As a result, a global strategy is being developed to explore the antiparasitic capabilities of various herbal plants in order to alleviate the problems caused by coccidial illness in the chicken industry.The main advantages of using herbal-based therapies to treat coccidiosis are their low toxicity and inexpensive production costs [ 3].Spinach ( Spinacia oleracea ) belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is a highly signiﬁcant and nutrient-dense plant.It contains numerous amounts of B vitamins, riboﬂavin, foliate, niacin, soluble dietary ﬁber, omega-3 fatty acids, and minerals.
Spinach is also abundant in iron, which protects against iron-deﬁciency-related illnesses, such as osteoporosis and anemia [ 4]. Spinach contains a variety of active compounds, including ﬂavonoids and other polyphenolic active ingredient molecules that act as antioxidants and anti-inﬂammatory agents.When ingested together, the ﬂavonoids, carotenoids, vitamins (C, E), and phenolic components in spinach have an antioxidative effect that reduces the harmful effects of free radicals [ 5].In addition, spinach leaf extract and its phytoconstituents were shown to have anti-inﬂammatory, antidiarrheal, antibacterial, antioxidant, and insecticidal properties [ 6].This study therefore aimed to investigate the anticoccidial effect of spinach extract on Eimeria tenella in experimentally infected broiler chicks.2.Results 2.1.
GC-MS of Spinach Extract A sample of spinach extract was subjected to gas chromatography examination, which revealed a high number of elements, with omega-3 accounting for the greatest amount, followed by oleic acid, palmitic acid, and phytol with concentrations of 23.37%, 17.53%, 11.26%, and 7.97%, respectively, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1.

Number of Developmental Parasitic Stages and Goblet Cells in Ceca of Chickens There was a signiﬁcant difference in the number of parasitic stages and the number of goblet cells in the treated groups relative to the infected–untreated groups. The diclazuril group had a lower number of parasitic stages than the spinach group but the spinach group contained a higher number of goblet cells than the diclazuril group (Table 7).Table 7.Developmental stages of Eimeria tenella and goblet cells per 10 villi in ceca dissected on day 8 PI compared with the positive control.Data expressed as mean ±S.D.

This indicates that the spinach extract had a good effect on preserving cell s from oxidative stress.

(*) the mean diffe rence is significant, (**) Low significance, (***) moderate significance, and (****) very high significance at p-value < 0.05.3.Discussion Polyether ionophore antibiotics, chemically synthesized anticoccidial drugs, and vaccines are the main methods of preventing and controlling coccidiosis in chickens.However, resistance has developed for all of the drugs currently in use, which remains a significant limitation for their use [7].Although vaccination is a viable alternative to the synthetic chemical anticoccidial drugs, its use is constrained by a laborious manufactur-ing process, the high expense of production and licensing of new vaccines, and the dan- ger of pathogen spread (with the injection of attenuated coccidiosis vaccines) [8,9].
Therefore, interest in research on alternate anticoccidial treatments, such as plant ex- tracts, has been substantially developed [10,11]. Following this approach, the current study compared the in vitro and in vivo efficacies of spinach extract and diclazuril against Eimeria tenella in experimentally infected chickens.Figure 6.Effect of diclazuril and spinach extract on levels of some oxidative stress markers in ceca of chickens in different groups.(*) the mean difference is signiﬁcant, (**) Low signiﬁcance, (***) moderate signiﬁcance, and (****) very high signiﬁcance at p-value < 0.05.3.Discussion Polyether ionophore antibiotics, chemically synthesized anticoccidial drugs, and vac- cines are the main methods of preventing and controlling coccidiosis in chickens.However, resistance has developed for all of the drugs currently in use, which remains a signiﬁcant limitation for their use [ 7].
Although vaccination is a viable alternative to the synthetic chemical anticoccidial drugs, its use is constrained by a laborious manufacturing process, the high expense of production and licensing of new vaccines, and the danger of pathogen spread (with the injection of attenuated coccidiosis vaccines) [ 8,9]. Therefore, interest in research on alternate anticoccidial treatments, such as plant extracts, has been substantially developed [ 10,11].Following this approach, the current study compared the in vitro and in vivo efﬁcacies of spinach extract and diclazuril against Eimeria tenella in experimentally infected chickens.The GC-MS technique was employed in this investigation to determine the probable chemical compounds in an extract of Spinacia oleracea .According to the ﬁndings of this Molecules 2023 ,28, 6621 10 of 18 study, the ethanol extract of S.
oleracea (whole plant) contained a high concentration of fatty acids, sterol, diterpenoids, and triterpenes, all of which are known to regulate the antioxi- dant pathway and modulate inﬂammatory processes with anti-cancer properties [12–14] . Similar components were reported by Abdelgawad et al.[ 15] in their phytochemical analy- sis of S.oleracea leaves from Egypt.According to the gas chromatography analysis, omega-3 made up the largest proportion of the spinach extract, which is consistent with the ﬁndings of Hetta et al.[ 16], who found that omega-3 is a major component of S.oleracea ﬂowers (30.53%).Similar to our ﬁndings, it was found that the main fatty acids in Polyalthia longifolia seed oil were oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids.It was also found that these acids had several biological properties, including anti-lipooxygenase, antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, anti-parasite, anti-microbial, and cytotoxicity properties.
α-linolenic acid (ALA), which is an omega-3 fatty acid, and Linoleic acid (LA), which is an omega-6 fatty acid, are regarded as essential fatty acids that are known to have antibacterial properties [ 17]. Therefore, the South African plants Helichrysum pedunculatum (family: Asteraceae) and Schotia brachypetala (family: Fabaceae), which mostly consist of linoleic and oleic acids as main components, are used for wound healing [ 18,19].C18 fatty acids, including oleic, linolenic, and linoleic acids, were demonstrated to have antimalarial effects by preventing the proliferation of malarial parasites in mice infected with Plasmodium vinckei petteri and Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis [20].Also, omega-3 fatty acids were found to provide health beneﬁts in the treatment of depression and schizophrenia [ 21,22], as well as beneﬁts for cancer, inﬂam- matory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and mental health [ 23].
In addition, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( ω-3PUFAs) are hypothesized to have beneﬁcial ef- fects on reducing cytokines and inﬂammation-associated proteins by altering the signaling pathways that regulate gene expression in inﬂammatory cells [ 24]. One example of these pathways is nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B), which is linked to the activation of the genes encoding several cytokines, adhesion molecules, and COX-2 [ 25].The proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which is activated by ω-3PUFAs, is an anti-inﬂammatory transcription factor that prevents NF-B from entering the nucleus.Allen et al.[ 26] evaluated the ef- fects ofω-3PUFAs from animal or plant sources on cecal lesions caused by Eimeria tenella (80 strain) in chicken vs.medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) or a simple starter diet (SS).They found signiﬁcant decreases in the mean cecal lesion scores, as well as decreases in bird mortality and signiﬁcant increases in IL-6 blood levels.Choi et al.
[ 27] discovered that ω-3PUFAs increased autophagy activation, resulting in decreased intracellular survival of T. gondii , suggesting that ω-3PUFAs could be used as a therapeutic candidate to prevent toxoplasmosis and infection with other intracellular protozoan parasites.According to Stok and Francis [ 28], the unsaturated fatty acid oleic acid was shown to be able to inactivate inﬂuenza type A virions.It was found that supplementation with omega-9, or oleic acid, is crucial in the metabolic dysfunction that occurs during sepsis because it increases the levels of the anti-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-10, lowers levels of the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1, and inhibits neutrophil migration [29].Through in vitro testing, it was discovered that the highest concentration of spinach extract produced the highest percentage of oocyst sporulation inhibition.
This may have been due to the ability of the spinach extract to modify the permeability of the oocyst wall, penetrate the oocyst wall, and damage the oocyst’s contents, as indicated by the cracked oocysts subjected to 10% spinach extract. Molan et al.[ 30] found similar effects when they tested pine bark ( Pious radiata , family: Pinaceae) extract on the sporulation of three species of avian coccidian oocysts.Fatemi et al.[ 31] also found that Artemisia annua (family: Asteraceae) extract has a signiﬁcant effect on the sporulation rate of mixed oocysts ofEimeria acervulina ,Eimeria necatrix , and Eimeria tenella .The number of oocysts per gram of feces and cecal content of oocysts was reduced in the spinach-treated chicks.It was discovered that spinach extract has a high concentration of phytonutrients, such as fatty acids, palmitic acid, Phytol, betulin, and ursolic aldehyde [32].
It was proposed that these compounds may change the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane, which inhibits many physiological functions and results in a loss of membrane potential, allowing vital Molecules 2023 ,28, 6621 11 of 18 cellular components to leak out, inhibiting protein and ATP production, and causing cellular death [ 33–35]. The present study found that following infection with E.tenella , the infected chicks had a higher cecal lesion score and less weight gain than the chicks in the negative control group similar to those reported by Conway et al.[ 36].According to Christaki et al.[ 33], the decrease in body weight in E.-tenella -infected chicks was attributed to the infection’s negative effects on food digestion, absorption, and metabolism.
The spinach- treated chicks recovered rapidly from infection and displayed a low degree of lesions because spinach contains numerous potent chemicals, including phytol and palmitic acid, which can accelerate and enhance wound healing [ 37]. Additionally, phytol has been found to possess potential anti-schistosome, antinociceptive, antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, and antiallergenic properties.Phytol is a frequently used food additive and serves as a precursor in the synthesis of vitamins E and K.Also, phytol possesses antibacterial properties that are effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [38].Vitamin K has been used to treat hemorrhages associated with coccidiosis and other diseases due to its coagulation-promoting properties [39,40].The body weight of the chicks in the spinach group signiﬁcantly increased.Sim- ilarly, Wagde et al.
[ 41] found a signiﬁcant increase in the body weight of ornamental ﬁsh ( Xiphophorus hellerii ) fed a spinach-extract-supplemented diet. These ﬁndings are in agreement with those of Abbas et al.[ 42], who noted a marked increase in body weight in the chicks treated with turmeric compared with the infected-untreated group.The diclazuril-treated group exhibited a signiﬁcant increase in body weight and a decrease in oocyst count; this ﬁnding was also consistent with that of Abbas et al.[43].Because spinach extract is high in fatty acids, it may have an inhibitory effect on different intracellular developmental stages of Eimeria , similar to their effect on Giardia duodenalis in vitro , which is severely impacted by media supplemented with fatty acids [ 44].The two primary immune-competent cells in the intestine are known to be mast cells and goblet cells.According to some studies, the mucus that goblet cells secrete can serve as a protective barrier [ 45].
Mucus serves as the ﬁrst line of defense against infections by protecting the gut epithelial layer from pathogens [ 46]. The decrease in goblet cells may indicate damage to the stem cell population.Goblet cells are produced through mitosis by multipotent stem cells located close to the base of the crypt [ 47].Changes in the number of goblet cells can hinder the parasite-infected host’s ability to prevent opportunistic infections from spreading or penetrating the local epithelium [ 48].The increase in goblet cells after infection may be due to the active compounds in spinach due to its strong anticoccidial properties and capacity to modify the goblet cell response after infection.This result is similar to that reported by Ramirez et al.[ 49], who found that neem increased the number of goblet cells in the mouse jejunum after infection with E.papillata .Our results suggest that spinach may be useful as a food supplement for animals with an Eimeria infection.
Spinach extract also contains ursolic aldehyde and betulin which have antiparasitic properties against Trypanosoma cruzi , as indicated by [50,51]. Spinach extract was discovered to have a powerful effect on free radical reduction because it includes palmitic acid and phytol, both of which have a substantial antioxidant effect in trapping free radicals [ 25,52,53].Their antioxidative properties are enhanced by suppressing reactive oxidant species (ROS) accumulation while recovering antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase and catalase [ 53].Several studies indicated that omega-3 PUFAs are essential for improving broiler immunity [ 54,55].Highly unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids can permeate the parasite’s tissues.After invasion, they are more vulnerable to oxidative assault by phagocytic cells.This oxidative stress has a deleterious impact on coccidian development [ 56,57].
Oxidative stress, which is hypothesized to be caused by highly unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, is likely to be deleterious to coccidia growth. According to certain theories, the membranes of coccidia contain unsaturated fatty acids.During development, their membranes undergo continual turnover, and dietary fatty acids inﬂuence the composition of the membranes.There, free radical-producing leucocytes will attack the coccidia, making them more vulnerable to oxidation [56,57].Molecules 2023 ,28, 6621 12 of 18 4.Materials and Methods This experiment was approved by the Beni-suef University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (BSU-IACUC), and the approval number is (022-237).Ethanol 70%, formalin, potassium dichromate, and phosphate buffer saline were among the chemicals used in this experiment; they were purchased from PIOCHEM chemical company in 6 October City, Egypt, while Diclazuril (Coxiril®0.2%) was obtained from Huvepharma N.V .Uitbreidingstraat 80, 2600 Antwerp, Belgium.
4.1. Botanical Extract Preparation Spinach (whole plant) was purchased from a local market and identiﬁed by specialists in the Botany Department, Faculty of Science, Beni-suef University, Egypt.The ethanol leaf extract of spinach was prepared according to Okechukwui et al.[ 58] with some modiﬁca- tions.Brieﬂy, the plant was cleansed with distilled water and air dried for one week before being ground into powder in an electrical blender.This powder was soaked in 70% alcohol for three days at room temperature in a ratio of 1:2 w/v(plant powder to 70% alcohol).During this period, the mixture was agitated three times per day.Finally, it was ﬁltered through ﬁlter paper, and the ﬁltrate was concentrated and dried in a rotatory evaporator at 40–50◦C.A total of 15 g of greenish viscous extract was produced for every 100 g of spinach powder.
The extracted material was kept in the refrigerator at 4◦C until usage, as phytochemicals’ bioavailability is impacted by the matrix and microstructure of the food they are present in, as well as the storage circumstances and temperature range [ 59]. Cold storage at temperatures below 5◦C is recommended for spinach to maintain its quality and improve its shelf life [60].Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry ( GC-MS ) of Spinach Extract The spinach was analyzed at the Nawah Scientiﬁc Educational Research Centre in Egypt “(https://nawah-scientiﬁc.com/) accessed on 26 September 2023” using a Trace Ultra gas chromatograph (GC) combined with a Thermo Scientiﬁc DSQ II mass spectrometer (MS).The chemicals were separated on a TR-5MS (30 m ×0.25 mm ×0.25 m) capillary column (Thermo Scientiﬁc) with helium ﬂowing at a rate of 1 mL/min and a temperature controlled from 60 to 250◦C at 3◦C/min.Temperatures of 220 and 250◦C were chosen for the MS transfer line and injector, respectively.
One milligram of spinach extract was diluted in one milliliter of acetone to make the sample. Manual splitless injection of the diluted material was performed in a volume of one liter.Mass spectra were acquired with the ion source temperature set at 240◦C and the MS set to EI mode at 70 eV .The compounds’ relative retention indices and mass spectra were compared with relevant information in the literature and databases [ 61].The relative retention index (RRI) was constructed using a series of n-alkanes (C8–C24).The relative percentages of the chemicals were determined through the use of area percentage data.4.2.Eimeria tenella Oocysts Collection The coccidian oocysts of Eimeria tenella were collected from naturally infected chicks.The oocysts were concentrated, sporulated in 2.5% potassium dichromate, and then orally inoculated in ﬁve healthy chicks to propagate the oocysts [ 62].Eight days post-inoculation, the birds were euthanized and the cecal contents were obtained.
The oocysts were concen- trated, then sporulated as previously mentioned, and stored in a refrigerator (2–5◦C) until use [63]. 4.3.In Vitro Evaluation of Spinach Extract against E.tenella Oocysts In a 96-well ELISA plate, the anticoccidial activity of spinach extract against E.tenella oocysts in vitro was evaluated.The extract was dissolved in potassium dichromate 2.5% (w/v) to prepare ﬁve concentrations of the extract: 10%, 5%, 2.5%, 1.25%, and 0.625.Each concentration was then placed in a well and 1200 oocysts were added.Then, 2.5% potassium dichromate was used as a negative control and 10% formalin served as the Molecules 2023 ,28, 6621 13 of 18 positive control.Each concentration was used in three replicates.The plate was incubated at 30◦C and after 24, 48, and 72 h, 25 µL from each well was placed on a glass slide and inspected under a microscope to determine the percentages of sporulated oocysts [ 64].
The sporulation inhibition effect of the extract was then estimated using the formula: (% ofinhibition = sporulation% of negative control −sporulation% of spinach extract). The concentration of spinach extract that had the greatest effect was utilized again to examine its effect in vivo.4.4.Experimental Design of In Vivo Evaluation of Spinach Extract against Eimeria tenella Oocysts on Broiler Chickens One hundred one-day-old broiler chicks of both sexes were purchased from El-Abd local company.These chicks were reared in wire-mesh batteries with free access to water and food, and the temperature was set at 34◦C, then decreased by 2◦C per week.At the age of 8 days, these chicks were divided into four groups of 25 chickens each as follows: The ﬁrst group comprised uninfected chicks and served as the negative control group.The second group was infected orally with 5 ×104E.tenella sporulated oocysts at the age of 18 days and acted as the infected control group.
The third group was the spinach-treated group, which began receiving spinach extract at a dose of 50 mg/kg supplemented with water at the age of 8 days as a prophylactic treatment and continued until the end of the experiment while being orally infected with 5 ×104sporulated oocysts of E. tenella at the age of 18 days and continuing the spinach treatment.The fourth group was the drug-treated group, which received 0.2 mg/kg diclazuril (Coxiril®0.2%) in food two days before being orally infected with 5 ×104E.tenella sporulated oocysts till day 10 post-infection (PI).At day 8 PI, ﬁve chickens from each group were sacriﬁced and ceca were retrieved for further studies (Figure 7).Molecules 2023 , 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 oocysts were concentrated, then sporulated as previously mentioned, and stored in a re- frigerator (2–5 °C) until use [63].4.3.In vitro Evaluation of Spinac h Extract against E.
tenella Oocysts In a 96-well ELISA plate, the anticoccidial activity of spinach extract against E. tenella oocysts in vitro was evaluated.The extract was dissolved in potassium dichromate 2.5% (w/v) to prepare five concentrations of the extr act: 10%, 5%, 2.5%, 1.25%, and 0.625.Each concentration was then placed in a well and 1200 oocysts were added.Then, 2.5% potas- sium dichromate was used as a negative cont rol and 10% formalin served as the positive control.Each concentration was used in three replicates.The plate was incubated at 30 °C and after 24, 48, and 72 h, 25 μL from each well was placed on a glass slide and inspected under a microscope to determine the percen tages of sporulated oocysts [64].The sporu- lation inhibition effect of the extract was th en estimated using the formula: (% of inhibi- tion = sporulation% of negative control − sporulation% of spinach extract).
The concen- tration of spinach extract that had the greatest effect was utilized again to examine its effect in vivo. 4.4.Experimental Design of In Vivo Evaluati on of Spinach Extract against Eimeria tenella Oocysts on Broiler Chickens One hundred one-day-old broile r chicks of both sexes were purchased from El-Abd local company .These chicks were reared in wire-mesh batteries with free access to water and food, and the temperature was set at 34 °C, then decreased by 2 °C per week.At the age of 8 days, these chicks were divided into four groups of 25 chickens each as follows: The first group comprised uninfected chicks and served as the negative control group.The second group was infected orally with 5 × 104 E.tenella sporulated oocysts at the age of 18 days and acted as the infected control group.
The third group was the spin- ach-treated group, which began receiving spinach extract at a dose of 50 mg/kg supple- mented with water at the age of 8 days as a prophylactic treatment and continued until the end of the experiment while being orally infected with 5 × 104 sporulated oocysts of E. tenella at the age of 18 days and continuing the spinach treatment.The fourth group was the drug-treated group, which received 0.2 mg/kg diclazuril (Coxiril ® 0.2%) in food two days before being orally infected with 5 × 104 E.tenella sporulated oocysts till day 10 post-infection (PI).At day 8 PI, five chickens from each group were sacrificed and ceca were retrieved for further studies (Figure 7).Figure 7.The experimental design depicts the entire cour se of the experiment, from the first day to the end.Figure 7.The experimental design depicts the entire course of the experiment, from the ﬁrst day to the end.4.5.Evaluation of Spinach Extract Anticoccidial Activity 4.5.1.
Clinical Examination, Clinical Symptoms, Mortality, and Bloody Diarrhea The chicks were examined daily for clinical signs, such as anorexia, rufﬂed feathers, diarrhea, crowding, loose droppings, difﬁculty breathing, and bloody droppings. The number of deaths was also recorded on a daily basis.From day 4 to day 10 PI, fecal samples were collected from each group and grossly inspected for blood.4.5.2.Lesion Scoring and Cecal Core On day 8 PI, ﬁve birds were randomly selected from each group and inspected for lesion scoring.The 0–4 lesion-scoring categorization was used to classify the lesions, which Molecules 2023 ,28, 6621 14 of 18 included petechial hemorrhages, bloody fecal contents, cecal wall thickening, and mucoid discharge.Based on the severity of the lesions, no lesions (0), mild lesions (1), moderate lesions (2), severe lesions (3), or very severe lesions (4) were determined for each bird [ 65].4.5.3.
Parasitological Examination (Oocyst Count per Gram of Feces) From day 4 PI to day 10 PI, randomly selected fecal samples from each group were collected and prepared for examination according to the methods indicated by Hodgson [ 66] and Long and Rowell [ 67]. In brief, 10 g of feces were dissolved in 100 mL of water and left at room temperature in well-covered cups for 24 h.After carefully mixing and sieving the solution, 15 mL of it was centrifuged for 5 min.After removing the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in a few milliliters of saturated salt solution (NaCl) using a vortex or by tapping the tube.More salt solution was added to the initial 15 mL volume, and the tube was repeatedly turned upside down.
Once a sample was added to the McMaster counting chamber by a Pasteur pipette, oocysts ﬂoated to the top of the solution, the number of oocysts was counted, and the total number of oocysts per gram was estimated using the equation below: Number of oocysts per gram of litter =n 0.15×volume ×0.1 where “ n”—number of counted oocysts, “0.1”—correction for 10 g originally taken from the litter, “0.15”—volume of the McMaster counting chamber, and “ Volume ”—100 mL of water in which the litter was soaked. 4.5.4.Oocyst Index The ceca of the ﬁve chicks previously selected on the day 8 PI were dissected and their contents were collected and prepared for counting their oocyst content using the previously mentioned McMaster chamber method [66–68].4.6.Growth Performance The chicks were weighed once a week from the start of the experiment to the end.The weekly increase in body weight was calculated by subtracting the starting weight from the total weight.
From day 1 to day 20, the birds were fed a coccidiostat-free commercial starter food. When the birds were 21 days old, the starting diet was replaced with a ﬁnisher diet, which was fed till the end of the experiment.During the pre-infection and post-infection periods, daily feed and water intake were recorded.The total feed intake for each week was calculated by deducting the amount of feed rejected from the feed supplied.Finally, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was determined for each week using this formula: FCR=feed intake weight increase.4.7.Histological Studies Parts of the ceca from the previously selected ﬁve chicks on day 8 PI were separated and ﬁxed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin.Then, these samples were processed for normal histology, as described by Tanweer et al.[ 65].Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to estimate the number of parasitic stages while other sections were stained with Alcian blue to assess the number of goblet cells.
The number of goblet cells in each animal’s cecum was counted in well-oriented villous crypt units (VCUs). The results were expressed as the average number of goblet cells per 10 VCUs [ 69].In addition, H&E sections were examined for inﬂammation, necrosis, degeneration, and other pathological alterations.4.8.Biochemical Studies (Oxidative Markers) on the Ceca of Infected Birds Parts of the selected ceca were washed in 10% phosphate-buffered solution before being homogenized with 0.9% saline at a 1:10 g/mL ratio and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min.The resultant supernatant was separated, divided into aliquots, and stored Molecules 2023 ,28, 6621 15 of 18 at−80◦C in eppendorf tubes to determine some oxidative stress markers.The level of lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) produced by the breakdown of polysaturated fatty acids.
The interaction of lipid peroxida- tion products with thiobarbituric acid quantiﬁes the products of lipid peroxidation [ 70]. Superoxide-Dismutase (SOD) activity was determined using pyrogallol autoxidation in- hibition as described by Marklund and Marklund [ 71].Peroxidase activity (GPX) was measured spectrophotometrically according to the procedure suggested by Manoranjan and Mishra [ 72], catalase (CAT) activity was estimated in the tissue extract according to the method described by Cohen et al.[ 73], and the nitric oxide (NO) concentration was determined using the method outlined by James and Glaven [74].4.9.Statistical Analysis Data was statistically analyzed using SPSS version 17.0 and graph pad prism 8 soft- ware.One-way ANOVA, followed by least signiﬁcant difference (LSD) was used for the comparison between the test and control group and data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD); p-values <0.05 ( p< 0.05) were considered statistically signiﬁcant.5.
Conclusions Spinach has an anticoccidial impact because it inhibits the sporulation percentage of Eimeria tenella oocysts, increases body weight, decreases the count of oocysts and parasitic stages in the cecum, restores the number of goblet cells to that of an uninfected control, and has a substantial antioxidant effect. In the present work, we used 5% spinach extract in vivo because it had a high sporulation inhibition effect relative to 10% spinach extract in vitro , but we recommend using higher concentrations to study its effect on coccidiosis models and other species that infect chickens and other animals.Author Contributions: Conceptualization: S.M.A.and A.-A.S.A.-B.; data curation: S.A.-Q.and A.-A.S.A.-B.; formal analysis: H.E.-F.and H.A.-T.; funding acquisition: A.-A.S.A.-B.and S.A.-Q.; investigation: O.E.and H.A.-T.; methodology: O.E., H.A.-T.and P .F.; supervision: S.M.A.and A.-A.S.A.-B .; validation: P .F., S.A.-Q.
