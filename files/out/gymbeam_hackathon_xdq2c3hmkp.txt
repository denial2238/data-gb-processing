Introduction. Dietary supplements with vitamin and calcium are recommended to nursing home residents in Denmark, but adherencetotherecommendationislow.Inapreviouspartofthisstudy,wereportedimprovedadherencebymeansofTeModel forImprovementleadingtoincreasedawarenessandchangeofworkfowsattwonursinghomes.However,potentialefectsofthis improved adherence are unknown.Objective.Te objective of this substudy was to investigate if the improved adherence to the recommendation afected vitamin D status, muscle strength, and physical functioning of the residents.Methods.Tis was a 20- weekquasiexperimentalstudyinvolving40residentsfromtwoDanishnursinghomes.Baselineandendpointmeasurementstook place in October 2021 and March 2022, respectively.Outcomes were number of residents taking vitamin D and calcium supplements;vitaminDstatus;handgripstrength;andphysicalfunctioningwithtimed-up-and-gotestand30-secondchairstand test.Results.
Prevalence of vitamin D supplement users increased from 45 to 78% (mean dose 41 μg) and of calcium supplement users from 40 to 72% (mean dose 769mg) (both P�0.002). Among those having blood sampled at both baseline and endpoint (n�30), mean vitamin D status increased from 66.6 ±31.7nmol/L to 82.8±26.3nmol/L (P<0.001), and more residents were vitamin D sufcient at endpoint (90 vs.63%, P�0.021).Endpoint vitamin D status among supplement users was 88.2±22.2nmol/L, which was higher compared to nonsupplement users (55.3 ±30.4nmol/L, P<0.01).No efects were seen on muscle strength or physical functioning.Conclusions.Increased supplementation with vitamin D using Te Model for Im- provement positively afected vitamin D status and prevalence of vitamin D sufciency but did not afect muscle strength or physical functioning.Longer-term studies involving more residents are needed to investigate efects of improved adherence on these outcomes.Tis trial is registered with NCT04956705.
1.Introduction Olderadultsresidingatnursinghomesarerecommendedadaily supplement of vitamin D, sometimes in combination withcalcium, to support bone health and decrease risk of osteopo-rosis, falls, and fractures [1–4]. However, vitamin D defciency,assessedas25-hydroxyvitaminD(25(OH)D) <30nmol/L[5],is prevalentamongnursinghomeresidentswheresupplementuseis low [3, 6–8], both because they spend limited time outside inthe sun and because the capacity for vitamin D synthesis in theskin declines with age [9].
Moreover, appetite tends to decreasewith age and few foods contain large amounts of vitamin D [8].When it comes to calcium, the fractional absorption from theintestinedecreaseswithage[10].Teabovefactorshighlighttheimportance of following the recommendation of taking vitaminD and calcium as supplements, especially in countries with lowWiley Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism Volume 2024, Article ID 2405429, 9 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/2405429 food fortifcation and during winter at northern latitudes where vitamin D synthesis in the skin is negligible for 5 to 6 monthsayear[11].However,wepreviouslyreportedalowadherencetothe recommendation of 20 μg vitamin D and 800– 1000mg calcium supplements at Danish nursing homes [12]. In a pre-vious quality improvement study with more than 100 nursing home residents, we targeted the barriers for giving the sup- plements using the Model for Improvement [13].
Tis resultedin a 102% improvement in the number of residents given therecommended supplements [14]. When it comes to Northern European countries, we only have few data on vitamin D status among nursinghome residents.A recently published systematic reviewreportedmeanserum25(OH)Dconcentrationintherangeof 34–40nmol/L among Swedish nursing home residentsfrom three diferent studies and around 30nmol/L amongnursinghomeresidentsinoneIrishstudy[8].Nodatawere reported from Danish nursing homes.Moreover, to our knowledge, it has never been investigated to what extentvitamin D status may improve in this vulnerable group asa response to eforts of improving adherence to the sup-plement recommendation.It has been suggested that vitamin D supplements can improve muscle strength of older adults [15], while otherstudies fnd no efects on muscle strength or physicalfunctioning [16–19] or even adverse efects on these out-comes [20].
Tus, the importance of vitamin D supple-mentation for muscle function among nursing homeresidents is unclear. Based on the above, the primary objectives of this study were to investigate whether an improved adherence to thevitamin D and calcium supplement recommendation inDanishnursinghomeresidentsafecttheirvitaminDstatus,physical functioning, and muscle strength.2.Methods 2.1.Study Design.Tis was a 20-week winter trial with a quasi-experimental design.Baseline and endpoint mea-surements took place at two nursing homes in Denmark(55 °N) in October 2021 and March 2022, respectively.Te outcomes were the number of residents having dailysupplements with vitamin D and calcium, their vitamin Dstatus, physical functioning, and muscle strength.Tispaperpresentsparttwoofthepreviouslydescribed study.It investigates the causal impact of improvingimplementation of the vitamin D and calcium supplementrecommendation at the recruited nursing homes in a re- alistic setting.
In part one, we conducted small-scale ex- periments under the Model for Improvement to improveadherence to the recommendation. Te experiments were:(1) implementation of an information sheet about therecommendation to ensure improved supplement useamong the residents and (2) adjustment of admissionmeetings to include the recommended supplements asa topic to address [14].However, no outcomes related toefects of this improved adherence were included inthat study.2.2.Participantsand Recruitment.Te participants were all residents at the two nursing homes, as described in ourprevious paper [14].Inclusion criteria were the ability tounderstand and speak Danish to understand the studyprocedures and to give informed consent.Exclusion criteriawerereceivingmedication,whichmayinduceadverseefects incombinationwithvitaminDand/orcalciumsupplements, known kidney disease, being terminally ill, or being de-pendent on a guardian.
Before initiating the recruitmentprocess the nursing home staf provided the project re-sponsible with names of residents who were not to becontacted based on the above criteria. Te project re-sponsible had individual information meetings with theremaining residents in their apartments at the nursinghomes and informed them about the study’s aim, design,methods, importance, and potential risks.Moreover, theyreceived written information on the study.If a resident wished to take time to consider their participation or talk with their relatives before deciding, the project responsiblefollowed up after 2-3days.2.3.Measurements 2.3.1.Vitamin D and Calcium Supplement Intake.We assessed a resident’s intake of vitamin D and calcium supplementsandmultivitaminsbyreviewofpatientrecords.Few residents purchased supplements by themselves (with no prescription from the general practitioner).
In these cases,theprojectresponsiblehadinformationondoses,etc.,directlyfromtheresident.Formoredetails,seethepaperonpart one of the study [14]. 2.3.2.Hydroxyvitamin D Measurements.A venous blood sample was drawn from the residents at baseline and end- point, respectively.Sampling took place from 9 to 12 amafter a self-selected breakfast.Te venous blood sampleswere drawn by trained staf and according to guidelines inserum tubes with gel (VACUETTE ®TUBE 3.5ml CAT Serum Separator Clot Activator (Greiner Bio-One,Kremsm¨unster,Austria))andleftforcoagulation.Withinsix hours after collection, samples were centrifuged at 2000 ×g for 10minutes.Te serum was transferred to cryotubes(2mL Redline, Heinz Herenz Hamburg, Germany) andstoredat −80 °Cuntilanalysis.Allsampleswereanonymized using anID-log connectingthestudy participantswiththeirbiological material.
Te serum samples were analyzed asbatch analyses for vitamin D status assessed as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (D 3+D2), using the competitive chemiluminescence binding assay at a Liaison XL (DiaSorinInc., Italy) [21]. Both baseline and endpoint samples wereanalyzed after the endpoint samples were collected.Afteranalysis, the remaining sample material was destructed.VitaminDstatuscategoriesusedwereaccordingtoInstituteof Medicine (IOM) and the Nordic Nutrition Recommen-dations as follows: Vitamin D defciency defned as serum 25(OH)D<30nmol/L and vitamin D sufciency defned as≥50nmol/L [5, 22].2 JournalofNutritionandMetabolism 2.3.3.Muscle Strength.We measured muscle strength as handgrip strength (HGS) using a hydraulic Jamar hand dynamometer (Patterson Medical, UK), which is the mostwidely used instrument [23].HGS is considered represen-tative of whole-body strength and a predictor of physicalfunctioning, hospital length of stay, and mortality [24].
Moreover, it has been reported to have a high test-retest reliabilityinolderadults[25].Teparticipantssatonachairwithback-andarmrestsorintheirwheelchair.Elbowwasina 90 °fexion and the arm placed on the armrest. Te dy- namometer was gently supported below by the instructor tominimize the efect of gravity as suggested by others [23].Te residents performed three measurements with thedominant hand and with a 60-second break betweenmeasurements.MaximumHGSwasthehighestvalue(tothenearest 1kg) of the three measurements.Roberts et al.previously suggested the highest value of six measurements to be the maximum muscle strength (three with each hand) [23],butwemodifedthisapproachwiththetargetgroupinmind to avoid fatigue.A HGS of <16kg for women and <27kg for men, respectively, has been suggested as sarco-penia cutofs [26].2.3.4.Physical Functioning.Physical functioning was esti- mated with the timed-up-and go test and the 30-s chair- stand test.
Te timed-up-and-go test (TUG test) is a vali- dated and recommended tool to evaluate fall risk among older adults [27, 28]. Participants sat in a chair with back-and armrests.Tey were instructed to rise from seatedposition,walkataself-selectedandsafepacetoalineonthefoor3mfromthefrontofthechair,turnaround,walkback,and sit down.Time was started at the signal “go” and wasstopped when the participant sat on the chair again.If theparticipant normally used a walker, they also used it duringthe test [29].Te TUG test was performed three times witha120-secondbreakbetweentests.Tetestwiththebesttimewas used as the fnal score of the participant.Previously, it has been suggested that a score of more than 12seconds in the TUG test indicates increased fall risk [27].Te 30-second chair-stand test (30CST) has a high test- retestreliabilityamongolderadultsandisavalidmeasureoflower body strength [30] and fall risk [31] by counting howmany full stands can be achieved in 30seconds.
Te par-ticipantssatinachairwithback-andarmrests.Weusedthesamechairatbothbaselineandendpointtoensureidenticalheight of the chair at both times. Te instructor demon-strated the test, and participants were instructed to use thearmrests while standing to ensure a safe test.Tus, this is a modifed version of the standard test, which is without armrests [30].An instructor stood behind for safety, madea countdown, and started a stopwatch at the signal “go.”Time was started even if the participant did not initiate theprocess of standing immediately.Te instructor silentlycountedthenumberoffullstandswithinthe30-secondtimelimit.If the last stand was more than halfway up, thiscounted as a full stand.According to the guidelines, de-creased physical functioning is prevalent if a resident per-forms less than nine stands in a standard test with noarmrests, and it is recommended to perform an additionaltest of gait speed if a resident performs from fve to eightstands [32].2.4.Statistical Analyses.
Data were analyzed with the sta- tistical software IBM SPSS Statistics 29.0.1.0. Descriptive data are presented as n(%) or mean and SD when appro- priate.We checked variables for normality with Shapir-o–Wilk test and visually with Q-Q plots.Mean changes incontinuous outcome variables (vitamin D status, physicalfunctioning,andmusclestrength)frombaselinetoendpointwere examined with paired t-tests.Corresponding changes in categorical variables (supplementation Y/N, vitamin Dstatus category) were examined with McNemar’s test.Comparisons in vitamin D status, physical functioning, and muscle strength atendpoint betweenvitamin D supplement users and nonusers were done with independent samples t- tests.IthaspreviouslybeensuggestedthatefectsofvitaminD status on soft tissues may require a serum 25(OH)D>75nmol/L [5, 33].
Moreover, Te European Calcifed Tissue Society defnes sufciency as a serum 25(OH)D>75nmol/L[34].Basedonthis,westratifedchangesfrom baseline to endpoint in the physical tests, and musclestrength test by vitamin D status at endpoint (either<75nmol/L or≥75nmol/L) and compared groups with independent samples t-test. Associations between categor- ical variables (supplementation Y/N and vitamin D statuscategory) were tested with chi-squared test or Fisher’s ExactTest when more than 20% of cells had expected frequencies<5.A Pvalue below 0.05 was considered signifcant.2.5.PowerCalculation.Te power calculation was based on the wish to show a signifcant change in vitamin D statusafter 20weeks.
A previous Danish study showed a mean vitamin D status of 35±19nmol/L among more than 9,600 community-dwellingolderadults[35].Astheolderadultsin the present project are nursing home residents, we expectedalowerinitialvitaminDstatus.AssumingabaselinevitaminD status of 27nmol/L (delta �8), a power of 0.8, and asignifcancelevelof0.05,thisgavearequiredsamplesizeofn�90.Takingmissingbloodsamplesintoaccount,atotalof n�100 residents would preferably be recruited. 3.Results 3.1.ParticipantFlowandTimeline.Tetimelineofthestudy andthefowofthestudyparticipantsareshownin Figure1.3.2.BaselineCharacteristics.AsseeninFigure1,atotalof40 residents (37%), all Caucasians, at the two nursing homes gave written informed consent.Table 1 shows baselinecharacteristics of the participants.Frequencies of defcient(<30nmol/L), insufcient (30–49.9nmol/L), and sufcient(≥50nmol/L) vitamin D status were 21%, 16%, and 63% ofresidents, respectively.

Tese values aresomewhat comparable to grip strength among similar agegroups reported in a previous meta-analysis [37] but lower compared to older Danish adults (>80years) in the Copenhagen Sarcopenia Study in which mean HGS was20.3kg and 33.7kg in women and men, respectively. 3.3.Changes in Vitamin D and Calcium Supplement Intake.Four residents passed away before endpoint measurements,and frequency of residents having the supplements aretherefore based on 40 and 36 residents at baseline andendpoint, respectively.Among the four deceased, two hadvitamin D and calcium supplements at baseline.Te prevalenceofresidentshavingvitaminDsupplementsinany dose increased from 45% at baseline to 78% at endpoint,whereas the prevalence of having calcium supplements in-creased from 40% to 72% (both P�0.002).AmongthevitaminDusers,themeandoseofvitaminD at baseline was 37.3 μg/day.At endpoint, mean vitamin D intake from supplements was 41.1 μg/day.
Te most fre- quently consumed dose of vitamin D was 38 μg/day at both baselineandendpoint(asthiscorrespondedtotwotabletsof19μg). Among the calcium supplement users, the mean baseline dose was 750mg/day, which increasedto 769.2mg/ day at endpoint.Te most frequently consumed dose was 800mg/day at both baseline and endpoint.3.4.EfectsonVitaminDStatus.Atotalof30participantshad blood drawn at both baseline and endpoint.Mean baseline vitaminDstatusamongthesewas66.6 ±31.7nmol/L,andthis increased to 82.8±26.3nmol/L (P<0.001, Figure 2), corre- sponding to a 24% increase in serum 25(OH)D.Amongthe30participantshavingbloodsampledatboth times, the prevalence of sufciency (25(OH)D ≥50nmol/L) increased during the intervention from 63% (n �19) at baseline to 90% (n �27) at endpoint (P �0.021).Te prevalence of vitamin D defciency (25(OH)D <30nmol/L) changed from 17% (n �5) to 3% (n �1) at endpoint, al- though this was insignifcant (P �0.125).
Vitamin D status among residents receiving vitamin D supplements at endpoint was 88.2 ±22.2nmol/L, whereas vitamin D status among those not having vitamin D sup-plementsatendpointwas55.3 ±30.4nmol/L(Table2)which is a diference between groups of 32.9nmol/L (P <0.01).3.5. Efects on Physical Functioning and Muscle Strength.At baseline, the number of residents conducting the HGStest, TUG test, and the 30SCT, were 39, 28, and 26, re-spectively.At endpoint, corresponding numbers among the36 remaining participants were 32, 18, and 16, respectively.Reasons for not performing the tests are shown in Figure 1.Despite improved mean vitamin D status, mean HGS, TUG test, or 30SCT did not change from baseline to endpoint(P�0.67, 0.16, and 0.66, respectively).3.6.Efects According to Vitamin D Supplement Intake.When comparing vitamin D supplement users (n �28) with nonusers(n �8)atendpoint,theperformanceofmeanHGS, TUG test, or 30SCTdid not difer between groups (Table 2).3.7.
Efects According to Vitamin D Status Category. When comparing changes from baseline to endpoint in thephysical tests and muscle strength stratifed by vitamin Dstatus,either<75nmol/Lor≥75nmol/L,nodiferenceswere seen betweengroups (P �0.34, 0.25,and 0.55,respectively).3.8.Associations between Vitamin D Supplement Intake andVitamin D Status Category.We found a signifcant associ- ation betweentakingvitaminD supplementsand vitaminDstatus category at baseline.Tat is, at baseline, all residentsconsuming vitamin D were vitamin D sufcient (serum25(OH)D≥50nmol/L), whereas 67% of residents not con- suming vitamin D at baseline were vitamin D insufcient(P�0.001).In addition, at endpoint, we saw a tendency to an association, i.e., 96% of the residents consuming vitaminD were vitamin D sufcient, whereas 40% of residents notconsuming vitamin D where vitamin D insufcient (P�0.064).
4.Discussion In this quasi-experimental study, we found increased mean vitamin D status after a 20-week winter period among theresidentslivingattwonursinghomesatwhichtheModelforImprovement was used to elicit a better adherence to theofcialrecommendationofsupplementationwithvitaminDand calcium. Correspondingly, only 10% of the residentswere vitamin D insufcient (25(OH)D <50nmol/L) at endpoint in March.Vitamin D status was increased by21nmol/L among supplement users and was reduced by11nmol/L among nonsupplement users at endpoint.However, despite improved 25(OH)D concentration during winter,neitherincreasednorreducedmeanmusclestrength or physical functioning was seen.
To our knowledge, only one study has been performed with a similar design and with vitamin D status as outcome.In an American study in which the general practitioners ofthe nursing home residents were urged to increase thenumber of vitamin D prescriptions through an educationalletter, vitamin D status was determined in a subgroup of 11residents before and after the 6-month intervention period.Although the mean changes in vitamin D status were notJournalofNutritionandMetabolism 5 reported, it was noted that only two (i.e., 18%) [38] had endpoint 25(OH)D>75nmol/L. In comparison, 63% had endpoint vitamin D status>75nmol/L in the present study.In this regard, it should be noted that the mean consumedvitamin D dose in our study was higher than the ofciallyrecommended dose of 20 μg/day, which may explain that a relatively high number of the residents had endpoint25(OH)D>75nmol/L.
Terefore, even though our results show that supplementation with vitamin D efectively in-creasesvitaminDstatusinthisvulnerablegroup,wecannotknow to what extent serum 25(OH)D concentration wouldincrease if only the recommended doses were prescribed. Te mean improvement of vitamin D status at the two includednursinghomescorrespondedto24%.Aprevious1-year longitudinal study including both teenage girls andolder Danish women (n �106) estimated that vitamin D status from summer to winter improves with an average of41% if initiating taking vitamin D supplements during winter [39].As baseline mean vitamin D status was >50nmol/Linthepresentstudy,thismaylowertheincreasein vitamin D status.When looking at the nonsupplementusersatendpoint,thesehadavitaminDstatusof55nmol/Lin March.Tis is somewhat higher than expected from otherstudies.
A study obtaining blood samples from 545 SwedishnursinghomeresidentsfromJanuarytoMarchshowedamean25(OH)D of 34nmol/L and insufciency prevalence of 82%.Only17%oftheseresidentshadvitaminDsupplements[40].ADanish study including seasonal blood samples from more than 3,000 persons (2–69years) showed that serum 25(OH)D was 36nmol/L and 43nmol/L among male and female adultnonsupplement users, respectively. Te corresponding serum25(OH)D for supplement users was 63nmol/L and 72nmol/L,respectively [41].Endpoint serum 25(OH)D for supplementusers in the present study was 88nmol/L which again mayrefect the higher doses prescribed.We found no efects on muscle strength or physical functioning from vitamin D and calcium supplementation.Several factors may contribute to this.First, we includeda relatively small sample size, and among the recruited par-ticipants,wesawthatfewerparticipantswereabletohaveblood sampledandperformthephysicaltestsatendpointcomparedto baseline.
Terefore, we must consider the likelihood of type 2errors.

Tis is in accordance with a recently pub- lished study concluding that vitamin D-replete individuals donot beneft from vitamin D supplementation [43]. Tird, thestudydesignmaycontributetothedifcultyobservinganefecton muscle strength and physical function.As our study was anefectivenesstrial,wewishedtomeasurethedegreeofbenefcialefect from improved vitamin D supplement use in a realisticsetting rather than studying efects under controlled circum-stances as in an efcacy trial where the preferred design wouldbe a placebo-controlled randomized trial [44].Even though we did not see an efect of vitamin D sup- plementation and/or improved vitamin D status on physicalfunctioning, it could be speculated that improved 25(OH)Dduring winter may decelerate a decline in physical activitylevel.
A recent American study among low-functioning olderadults (n �571, 70+ years) reported an increased decline in physicalactivitylevelafterupto2yearsoffollow-upifbaselineserum 25(OHD) was<50nmol/L compared to≥50nmol/L [45]. Terefore, ensuring that nursing home residents do notbecome vitamin D insufcient may be important for overallmobility and prevention of decreased physical function overtime, and our fnding of status quo in muscle strength andphysicalfunctionaftera20-weekwinterperiodmaybeviewed as a positive result.Limitationsofthepresentstudyincludethesmallsample size included and thereby lack of power as only 40 residents (37%) volunteered to participate.One contributing factormaybethatdatacollectiontookplaceduringtheCOVID-19epidemic.In addition, due to the study design, there was norandomization.Terefore, we cannot know if residentstakingvitaminD and calciumsupplements difered in otheraspects.
For instance, it is plausible that residents followingthe recommendation also have more appetite and thus getmore vitamin D from the diet. Moreover, they may be more physicallyactive,spendmoretimeoutside,andtherebyhave increased cutaneous vitamin D synthesis.However, eventhough we did not estimate dietary vitamin D intake,physical activity level, or outdoor time, we expect variationsbetween residents to be relatively small and of low infuenceon vitamin D status as compared to supplementation.Another limitation of the present study is that we assumedthatdataonsupplementintakeinpatientrecordswereequaltoconsumeddoses,sinceitwasnotrealistictoobserveactualconsumption.However, according to the health care pro-fessionals, supplements appearing in patient records were always dosed and consumption checked regularly.
Strengths of the present study include the use of stan- dardized and relevant methods with a high test-retest re- liability to estimate muscle strength and physical functioningin the older adults. Moreover, tests were performed at ap-proximatelythesametimeofthedayatbaselineandendpointto avoid infuence of diurnal variations in the energy level.Also,bloodsamplesweredrawnatthesametimeofthedayatbaseline and endpoint.25-hydroxyvitamin D measurementswere performed as part of the diagnostic routine and inaccordance with guidelines from the Vitamin D Standardi-zation Program (VDSP) using standard reference material(NationalinstituteofStandardizationandTechnology,NIST),thereby allowing comparison of analyte levels to results published using the reference method liquid chromatogra- phy–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) [21].
5.Conclusions In conclusion, supplementation with vitamin D is practicaland efective to improve vitamin D status and prevalence ofvitamin D sufciency in nursing home residents during thewinterseason.Eventhoughphysicalfunctioningandmusclestrengthwerenotafectedinthisstudy,followingtheofcial recommendationoftakingsupplementswithvitaminDand calciumshouldstillbeurgedbasedontheevidenceofefectson bone health.
