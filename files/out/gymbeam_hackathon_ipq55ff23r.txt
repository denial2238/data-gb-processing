The relationship between AKIfollowing TAAR and serum magnesium levels remainsunknown. The intention of this research was to access thepredictive value of serum magnesium levels on admissionto the Cardiovascular Surgical Intensive Care Unit (CSICU)for AKI in patients receiving TAAR.Methods: From May 2018 to January 2020, a prospective, observational study was performed in the GuangdongProvincial People’s Hospital CSICU.Patients acceptingTAAR admitted to the CSICU were studied.The KidneyDisease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definitionof serum creatinine was used to define AKI, and KDIGOstages two or three were used to characterize severe AKI.Multivariable logistic regression and area under the curvereceiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) analysiswere conducted to assess the predictive capability of theserum magnesium for AKI detection.
Finally, the predictionmodel for AKI was established and internally validated.Results: Of the 396 enrolled patients, AKI occurred in 315 (79.5%) patients, including 154 (38.8%) patients withsevere AKI.

The mostcomplex and challenging surgical method used totreat TAAD is total aortic arch replacement (TAAR)(2). Nearly all major surgical operations have theinescapable hazards of systemic complications andend-organ damage, and aortic arch surgery is espe-cially pertinent (3, 4).Longer cardiopulmonarybypass (CPB) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest(DHCA) are used during the complicated open TAARprocedure, including aortic stent placement and aor-tic remodeling, which alters the blood supply to endorgans and eventually increases renal ischemia-reper-fusion injury (IRI) (5–7).In comparison to other car-diac procedures, acute kidney injury (AKI), a preva-lent postoperative complication especially after aorticsurgery, carries a risk of up to 71.94% (8).Cardiacsurgery-associated AKI (CSA-AKI) has a complicatedpathogenesis involving IRI, inflammatory response,metabolic imbalance, oxidative stress, and other fac-tors (9–12).
Since there is presently no efficient treat-ment for CSA-AKI, meaningful prognostic predictorscould be able to assist clinicians in making an earlydiagnosis and stratifying patients by the most effectiveand timely intervention. The second most abundant intracellular cation is magnesium, which is involved in several physiolog-ical processes connected to osteoporosis and cardio-vascular function, including vascular tone, endothelialfunction, glucose and insulin metabolism (13).Renalexcretion is the key regulating element in magnesiumhomeostasis, which is commonly referred to as aproper equilibrium between dietary magnesiumintake and excretion (14).In people with good renalfunction, tubular reabsorption and excretion through urine regulate magnesium homeostasis (15).Recently, it was discovered that renal function andserum magnesium levels are related.
For example,low serum magnesium levels may increase the poten-tial for kidney function deterioration among chronickidney disease (CKD) patients (16). Additionally,impaired renal function might result in the disruptionof magnesium excretion (17).CKD patients have anincreased risk for chronic hypermagnesemia, which isdefined by a standard dialysate magnesium levelgreater than 1.20 mmol/L (10, 18).Moreover,patients who had early elevated serum magnesiumlevels following cardiac surgery had a considerablyhigher risk of AKI, according to a recent multicenterretrospective study (19).The aforementioned resultsserve as a reminder that more investigation isrequired to elucidate any potential causal connectionsbetween serum magnesium and AKI.In order to evaluate the effectiveness of serum magnesium on CSICU admission in predicting AKIfollowing TAAR, we implemented a prospective,observational study.
Materials and Methods PatientsThis prospective investigation was carried out at the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery IntensiveCare Unit (CSICU), Guangdong Provincial People’sHospital (Guangzhou, China). We enrolled TAARpatients admitted to the CSICU from May 2018 toJanuary 2020 as determined by the attending physi-cian.Independent doctors blinded to serum magne-sium levels were free to choose the appropriaterelated to the postoperative AKI and severe AKI (both, P < 0.001), and AUC-ROCs for predicting AKI and severe AKIwere 0.707 and 0.695, respectively.Across increasingquartiles of serum magnesium, the multivariable-adjustedodds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of postoperative AKIwere 1.00 (reference), 1.04 (0.50–2.82), 1.20 (0.56–2.56), and 6.19 (2.02–23.91) ( Pfor T rend < 0.001).
When serum magnesium was included to a baseline modelwith established risk factors, AUC-ROC (0.833 vs 0.808, P= 0.050), reclassification (P < 0.001), and discrimination(P = 0.002) were further improved.Conclusions: Serum magnesium levels on admission are an independent predictor of AKI. In TAAR patients, elevatedserum magnesium levels were linked to an increased risk ofAKI.In addition, the established risk factor model for AKIcan be considerably improved by the addition of serummagnesium in TAAR patients hospitalized in the CSICU.Keywords :acute kidney injury, serum magnesium, car- diovascular surgical intensive care unit, total aortic archreplacement, acute aortic dissectionvisno povezani sa postoperativnim AKI i te{kim AKI (oba, P< 0,001), a AUC-ROC za predvi|anje AKI i te{kog AKI subili 0,707 odnosno 0,695.

The following were the exclusion standards: (1) under 18 years of age, (2)renal transplantation or nephrectomy, (3) renalreplacement therapy (RRT) or end-stage renal dis-ease (ESRD) before CSICU admission, (4) length ofCSICU stay being less than 24 h, (5) lack of admis-sion clinical data, and (6) refusal to consent.The cri-teria for ESRD were a baseline estimated glomerularfiltration rate (eGFR) of less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2or receiving hemodialysis.This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the GuangdongProvincial People’s Hospital and was conducted inaccordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.In for - med consent papers were signed by each participant.
Data sources Patients with TAAR who needed CSICU hospital- ization were eligible for enrollment. Only the first sur-gical hospitalization indices were included whenpatients underwent multiple cardiovascular surgeries.Patient demographic information, laboratory parame-ters and clinical data were prospectively obtained viathe hospital’s electronic medical record system.Theparticipant factors that were included were as follows:age, sex, body mass index, preexisting comorbiditiessuch as hypertension, stroke, diabetes, coronaryartery disease, previous cardiac surgery and New Y orkHeart Association (NYHA) functional class.Pre - operative two-dimensional echocardiographic datacalculated by the modified Simpson method includedascending aorta (AA) diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDD) and left ventricular ejectionfraction (LVEF).
Hemoglobin, D-dimer, hematocrit,albumin, and baseline estimated glomerular filtrationrate (eGFR), which was calculated by the CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration (EPI) creatinine equation(20). Surgical data were included as follows:American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) degree,specific surgery type based on TAAR including valvu-lar surgery and coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG), emergent surgery, the use of drugs includingdiuretics and vasopressor drugs, CPB time, aorticcross-clamping (ACC) time, DHCA time, intraopera-tive intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, opera-tion time, fluid management of crystalloid and col-loid, transfusion of packed red blood cells and bloodplatelets, and the use of magnesium supplementa-tion.
The sequential Organ Failure Assessment(SOFA) score, serum magnesium and total bilirubinlevels were recorded immediately after admission.SOFA scoring was used to estimate the overall condi-tion of patients and was evaluated 30 minutes afterrecovery from anesthesia. Exposure measurement The principal exposure variable in this investiga- tion was total serum magnesium which likely repre-sents the bioactive form of magnesium.Within an hour of CSICU admission, blood samples were takenusing heparin tubes.Following collection and storage,all of the samples from the participating department ofthe hospital were subjected to batch analysis within 24h.The Beckman Coulter AU5800 automatic analyzerwas used to analyze samples with the dimethyl anilineblue colorimetric technique.Additional variables, suchas intraoperative use of magnesium supplementationthat may influence exposure were recorded.
Definitions and outcomes The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Out - comes (KDIGO) criteria was used to assess the pri-mary outcome, which was the diagnosis of AKI,defined as a raise in baseline sCr of 26.5 mmol/L (0.3 mg/dL) in 48 hours or an increase of 50% in sCr fromthe preoperative level in 7 days (21). The baseline sCrlevel was defined as the most recent measured sCrvalue within 7 days before surgery.After CSICUadmission, we repeatedly measured SCr values for 7consecutive days.The highest sCr value was deter-mined when multiple sCr levels were measured on thesame day.The urine output criterion (< 0.5 mL/kg/hfor 6 h) was not used to define AKI because diureticsand intravascular hypovolemia, which are both com-mon in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, couldcause confounding (22).Severe AKI, defined as KDIGO stage 2 or stage 3 within 7 days following CSICU admission, was thesecondary endpoint.
According to KDIGO’s sCr crite-rion, AKI is categorized as follows: In the first stage,postoperative sCr increases to 1.5–1.9 times base-line, or ≥26.5 mmol/L (≥0.3 mg/dL); in the second, sCr increases to 2.0–2.9 times baseline; in the third,sCr increases to three times baseline, or ≥353.6 mmol/L (≥4.0 mg/dL) from baseline level, or the start of RRT . RRT types included continuous kidneyreplacement therapy, intermittent hemodialysis andcontinuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.The crite-ria of CKD were eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2.Statistical analyses Software R 4.3.1 and SPSS 26.0 were utilized to process all statistical data.First, we divided all TAARpatients into non-AKI and AKI groups.
Secondly, inorder to assess clinical stepwise correlations, theadmission serum magnesium levels were divided intoquartiles (0.56–0.91, 0.92–1.02, 1.03–1.24, and1.25–2.31 mmol/L for quartiles 1–4, respectively).Measured variables with a normally distributed arerepresented as the mean ± standard deviation, whilenon-normally distributed continuous data are dis-played as medians and interquartile ranges. T o com-pare continuous variables, the ANOVA test, theKruskal-Wallis test, or Cuzick’s test for trend were per- formed.T o compare the intergroup differences in cat- egorical variables presented as frequencies (%), thechi-square test was used.The odds ratio (OR) and95% confidence interval (CI) of each factor were cal-culated using maximum likelihood estimation in logis-tic regression analysis.
In order to evaluate the rela-tionship between clinical outcomes and the serummagnesium quartile as a continuous variable or aquartile-level categorical variable, serum magnesiumlevel was classified on demand and then logisticregression was performed. The multivariate logistic regression analysis included the following factors ( P < 0.05) that had sta- tistical significance in the univariate analysis to identifyindependent predictors and build the AKI predictionmodel (Model 1): age, stroke and hypertension histo-ry, preoperative LVDD and D-dimer, baseline eGFR,ASA ≥3, CPB time during the surgery, and total biliru- bin on admission and SOFA score after admission.Then we calculated the adjusted ORs with randomintercepts.The chosen biomarker, serum magnesium,was added into Model 1 and then Model 2 was gen-erated.
Finally, we compared Models 1 and 2 to assessthe performance of predictive improvement via theDeLong test for detecting differences in the areaunder the curve receiver-operator characteristic curve(AUC-ROC), net reclassification improvement (NRI)index, and integrated discrimination improvement(IDI) index (23). The average improvement in theanticipated probability of AKI was displayed by IDI,and NRI performed as a correlated indicator of thequantity of patients whose anticipated likelihood ofAKI was increased.The calibration of models is shownby calibration curves in terms of the conformitybetween the actual information and AKI diagnosis predictions (24).In addition, a novel technique calleddecision curve analysis (DCA) has been developed toassess prediction models, which aimed to acquire theclinical utility and usefulness of the suggested com-peting risk model (25).
Finally, we conducted amethod by randomly dividing the database into a setfor training (70%) and a set for validation (30%) totake independent observations to generate AUC-ROCfor internal validation. The performance of the modelsfor AKI detection was verified using each of the afore-mentioned internal verification techniques with 100replications.In every test, a two-tailed Pvalue less than 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.Results Cohort characteristicsBetween May 2018 and January 2020, 458 patients getting TAAR were enrolled.396 patientshad been included in the final analysis after excludingthose under 18 years old (n =2), those with preexist-ing impaired kidney function such as renal transplan-tation or nephrectomy (n =3), ESRD or RRT beforeCSICU admission (n =10) and an CSICU stay lengthbeing less than 24 h (n =2), missing admission clini-cal data (n =37) and those who refusal to consent (n=8).
Utilizing the sCr diagnostic criteria of KDIGO,patients were classified as AKI and Non-AKI groups.During the observation period of 7 consecutive days,315 (79.5%) patients developed AKI, and 154(38.8%) developed severe AKI during hospitalization(Figure 1 ). Three of patients with severe AKI had sub- sequently died in the hospital.J Med Biochem 2024; 43 (4) 577 Figure 1 Population flowchart for the study.ESRD end-stage renal disease, RRT renal replacement therapy, AKI acute kidney injury, CSICU cardiovascular surgical intensive care unit.578 Jiang et al.: Serum magnesium predicting AKI after aortic arch replacement Table I Study population baseline characteristics according to AKI.Categorical variables are shown as number (%).Continuous variables are shown as means (± standard deviation) or median (25th–7 5th percentile).

In contrast to patients with-out AKI, individuals with AKI were older, had moreserious comorbid conditions such as hypertension,higher preoperative D-dimer, worse preoperative car-diac function involving a larger LVDD and a narrowerAA diameter and a worse basic kidney functionincluding lower eGFR level, severe general conditionsuch as ASA ≥3 degree, and longer CPB time during the surgery. After CSICU admission, higher SOFAscores and serum magnesium levels were observed inthe AKI group.Nonetheless, Nonetheless, there wasno discernible variation in the intraoperative magne-sium supplement consumption between the twogroups ( P= 0.320), suggesting that there was no meaningful impact of magnesium supplementationon the key outcomes.Relationship between the progression of AKI and serum magnesium levels T able II displays the clinical attributes of the four groups, which is categorized by the quartiles of theserum magnesium level.
Elevated serum magnesiumlevels connected with a history of hypertension ( Pfor T rend = 0.001) and prior cardiac surgery ( Pfor T rend = 0.041), lower preoperative hemoglobin ( PforT rend = 0.019), albumin ( Pfor T rend = 0.033) and baseline eGFR ( Pfor T rend < 0.001), a higher rate of combination of CABG and Valve procedure based onTAAR ( Pfor T rend = 0.044), longer CPB time ( Pfor T rend = 0.007) and ACC time during the surgery ( P for T rend < 0.001), increased total bilirubin level onadmission ( Pfor T rend < 0.001), and more severe organ injury, such as SOFA score after admission ( P for T rend < 0.001). There was no significant differ-ence in the intraoperative use of magnesium supple-mentation ( Pfor T rend = 0.448) among the four groups.The AKI incidences were progressively higherin the quartile groups across gradually increasedmagnesium levels ( Pfor T rend < 0.001).For severe AKI, similar stepwise links were seen ( Pfor T rend < 0.001).
According to the histogram picture in Figure 2 , the prevalence of AKI and severe AKI increased pro-gressively as the serum magnesium levels increased(both, Pfor T rend < 0.001). For the purpose of pre- dicting AKI and severe AKI, the individual serummagnesium AUC-ROC values were 0.707 (95% CI,0.650–0.764) and 0.695 (95% CI, 0.641–0.748),respectively.Higher serum magnesium levels were found to be a continuous variable linked to the development ofAKI ( P= 0.002) and severe AKI ( P < 0.001), as Figure 2 The correlation between serum magnesium and postoperative outcomes.The incidence of AKI and severe AKI was related to the quartile of serum magnesium levels (a).The AUC-ROC analysis of serum magnesium to predict postoperative AKIand severe AKI (b).AKI acute kidney injury, AUC-ROC area under the curve receiver-operator characteristic curve.J Med Biochem 2024; 43 (4) 581 T able III illustrates.
Following multivariate adjustment, the results demonstrated that in TAAR patients, theserum magnesium level measured at admission wasan independent risk indicator for AKI ( P< 0.001) and severe AKI ( P< 0.001). Every 1 mmol/L increase about serum magnesium was linked to a24.53-fold increased risk of AKI (adjusted OR,24.53; 95% CI, 4.81–149.16) and a 12.63-foldincreased risk of severe AKI (adjusted OR, 12.63;95% CI, 4.65–36.32).In addition, if serum magne-sium levels were taken into account as a categoricalvariable, both AKI and the development of severe AKIshowed a significant rising trend as the serum mag-nesium quartile values rose (both Pfor T rend < 0.001).
After multivariate correction, patients in thehighest serum magnesium group had a 6.19-foldincreased risk of AKI (adjusted OR, 6.19; 95% CI,2.02–23.91) and a 3.57-fold heightened risk ofsevere AKI (adjusted OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.79–7.30).Relative contribution of serum magnesium to the clinical risk model for AKI T o thoroughly investigate more of the clinical contributions of adding serum magnesium to thebaseline model of the established risk factors, severalvalidation methods were performed. Established riskfactors for Model 1 included age, stroke and hyper-tension history, preoperative LVDD and D-dimer,baseline eGFR, ASA ≥3, CPB time during the surgery, total bilirubin on admission and SOFA score afteradmission.T able IV demonstrates that Model 1 wasable to predict postoperative AKI with a mild AUC-ROC of 0.808 (95% CI, 0.751–0.865).
After includ-ing serum magnesium in the baseline model (Model1), Model 2 was constructed and achieved a greaterAUC-ROC value of 0.833 (95% CI, 0.782–0.883),which was beyond that of Model 1.

The predictive ability of Model 2 wassignificantly better than Model 1, as indicated by theIDI (P = 0.002) and NRI ( P< 0.001) indices in patients after TAAR. Finally, Figure 3a displays the AUC-ROC curves for AKI detection using Models 1 and 2.The calibra-tion graphs of Models 1 and 2 show a respectablelevel of prediction accuracy ( Figure 3b-c ).Likewise, Figure 3d-e indicates that Model 2 generated a widerrange of net benefits compared to Model 1, and bothmodels outperformed the »full treatment« or »notreatment« plans in terms of overall benefits.Furthermore, a random split of the dataset into a val-idation set (n = 119) and a training set (n = 277)was performed.T o investigate Model 2’s internal per-formance, the training and validation sets were sub-jected to AUC-ROC analysis and the DeLong test.The AUC-ROCs of the set for training and vali- dation were 0.810 and 0.831, respectively ( P= 0.810).
These above results of internal validation thatwere repeated 100 times suggested that Model 2 hasa better performance for postoperative AKI predic-tion. Discussion These are the primary findings from our investi- gation.First, it was discovered that in TAAR patients,the serum magnesium level on admission was anindependent predictor of the development of AKI.Second, patients with serum magnesium in the upperquartiles were strongly linked to a higher risk of AKIand severe AKI in TAAR patients.Moreover, the pre-dictive value for AKI was much higher when serummagnesium was added to the established clinical riskmodel than when either biomarker or clinical riskmodel was used alone.Notably, this is the firstprospective study to evaluate the prognostic value ofserum magnesium for postoperative AKI in the TAARcohort.In this study, 315 (79.5%) of all 396 patients suffered AKI, and 154 (38.8%) developed severeAKI.One of the most serious and frequent sideeffects of cardiac surgery is AKI.
Such high incidencerates of AKI correlate with difficulty in the aortic sur-gical setting involving prolonged intraoperativehypoxia (5). Numerous past studies have demonstrat-ed that the aortic procedures carry more risks, notablyAKI, than other cardiac operations, such as valvereplacement and CABG (26, 27).Theoretically, AKI is a heterogeneous illness, and a combination of indicators may be more effec-tive than a single biomarker because it might reflectmultiple pathophysiological processes (28).Our mul-tivariate model was created after adjusting for several factors affecting the development of AKI after TAAR,which reaffirmed the fact that various types of periop-erative factors triggered AKI.
Our results were consis-tent with earlier research that found associationsbetween postoperative AKI and the following factors:the higher ASA degree, echocardiographic parame-ters such as LVDD, preoperative coagulation biomark-er D-dimer, operation time parameters including CPBtime, and SOFA score obtained 30 minutes afterrecovery from anesthesia (29–32). Similarly, wefound that an increased total bilirubin level uponadmission increases the chance of developing CSA-AKI.This situation may be brought on by hepatichypoperfusion for bilirubin clearance and bile trans-port, hemolysis, cardiotomy suction, and mechanicalprosthesis during CPB (33).More severe hyperbiliru-binemia may trigger the maintenance of bile casts,causing toxicity directly to the nephrons and resultingin AKI (34).Prediction Model 1, which was developedbased on the aforementioned clinical characteristics,had an AUC-ROC value of 0.808 and did not per-form better than the previously established predictionmodel (35, 36).
Renal tubular necrosis and the sub-sequent start of postoperative AKI are caused by sym-pathetic-adrenal medullary system overexcitation andneurohumoral regulatory dysfunction, which aremore likely to be caused by hemodynamics, renalischemia and hypoxia, systemic inflammation, and apoor general state (37, 38). The role of serum magnesium in the develop- ment of AKI has attracted close attention worldwide.A recent study found that elevated early serum mag-nesium levels after surgery was independently associ-ated with CSA-AKI (19).In line with previous similarresearch, we testified that admission measurement ofserum magnesium was a potential predictor for AKIfollowing TAAR in our prospective study.Further - more, the performance of serum magnesium onadmission in AKI detection in this study had a moder-ate AUC-ROC value of 0.707.The data above indi-cate that serum magnesium holds a relatively limitedpredictive value when used as a single biomarker forAKI after TAAR.
Interestingly, researchers discoveredthat the incidence of AKI was related to decreaseserum magnesium levels both preoperatively andintraoperatively, and patients who received magne-sium supplementation had a lower risk of AKI (39,40). Researchers have suggested that decreasedmagnesium levels have been linked to increased lev-els of both proatherogenic and inflammatorycytokines in endothelial cells, affecting renal function(41, 42).However, there was essentially no differencein the intraoperative usage of magnesium supple-mentation through among our groups.Therefore, theeffect of intraoperative magnesium supplementationon postoperative AKI requires further study byprospective intervention trials.Moreover, several retrospective studies have found that hypermagnesemia (serum magnesium > 582 Jiang et al.: Serum magnesium predicting AKI after aortic arch replacement 1.25 mmol/L) on ICU admission correlated with in- hospital death and AKI development (43, 44).
Similarto our findings, when compared to patients in thelowest quartile, the highest quartile patients had a6.19-fold risk of AKI and a 3.57-fold risk of severeAKI. These results implied that increased serum mag-nesium levels after TAAR might be an alterable riskfactor for AKI.Importantly, we founded that the AUC-ROC can be notably increased to 0.833 when serummagnesium is combined with the established Model 1for AKI detection, which can reap certain clinical ben-efits (NRI = 0.47, IDI = 0.04) and assist in the earlyidentification of AKI progression in clinical work.Comparing our optimized prediction model to thoseof other research, it exhibited comparable predictivepower (45, 46).
Although the exact mechanisms by which higher magnesium levels results in AKI remain unclear, thereare multiple theories regarding the magnesiummetabolism pathway that underlies renal disease.Primarily, magnesium is a naturally existing calciumantagonist that is also known to boost the synthesis oflocal vasodilation mediators and change the way theinternal vascular system reacts to different vasoactivesubstances (47). More specifically, postoperativerenal injury might occur from long-term hypoxiabased on the cross-clamping of significant arterialstructures and extracorporeal circulation during TAAR(48).As a result, aortic surgery-induced renal bloodflow reduction could drastically hamper the functionof magnesium excretion, leading to elevated serummagnesium levels and this process might occurbefore the identification of postoperative AKI basedon urine excretion or sCr criteria (44, 49, 50).
Hence,correcting magnesium homoeostasis might be a ben-eficial and low-cost intervention to reduce the risk ofAKI. Our study has several strengths.First, rather than concentrating only on the effects of a single bio-marker, this study also evaluated the combined effica-cy of serum magnesium and established multiplelogistic regression prediction model in the identifica-tion of AKI.Moreover, prospective enrollment ofpatients helped to minimize the possibility of recollec-tion bias.The study further includes restrictions.Initially, this study evaluated TAAR patients by a sin-gle-center studies which lacked external validation,and only Han Chinese patients were included.Second, despite the relatively large variety of factorsconsidered, there might have been possible variablesthat led to the absence of results.
Third, in order todynamically determine the association between bloodmagnesium level and postoperative AKI, it is impor-tant to take into account the variations in serum mag-nesium concentration during the perioperative periodat different time points. Finally, our study only record-ed serum magnesium levels and supplementationwith magnesium, which is not an ideal assessment oftotal magnesium storage in the human body.However, due to the comparative nature of this study, the above limitations do not affect the results of thisstudy.Conclusion Measurement of serum magnesium on CSICU admission is an independent predictor of AKI, andgreater serum magnesium levels on admission werelinked to an increased risk of AKI in TAAR patients.Finally, the established clinical risk model for AKI canbe greatly enhanced by the addition of serum magne-sium.
