Endo- β-1,4-glucanase is a critical speed-limiting cellulase in the sacchariﬁcation process.In this study, endo- β-1,4-glucanase gene ( CelA257 ) from Myxococcus sp.B6-1 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli .
CelA257 contained carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) 4-9 and glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 6 domain that shares 54.7% identity with endoglucanase from Streptomyces halstedii . The recombinant enzyme exhibited optimal activity at pH 6.5 and 50◦C and was stable over a broad pH (6–9.5) range and temperature < 50◦C.CelA257 exhibited broad substrate speciﬁcity to barley β-glucan, lichenin, CMC, chitosan, laminarin, avicel, and phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC).CelA257 degraded both cellotetrose (G 4) and cellppentaose (G 5) to cellobiose (G 2) and cellotriose (G 3).Adding CelA257 increased the release of reducing sugars in crop straw powers, including wheat straw (0.18 mg/mL), rape straw (0.42 mg/mL), rice straw (0.16 mg/mL), peanut straw (0.16 mg/mL), and corn straw (0.61 mg/mL).This study provides a potential additive in biomass sacchariﬁcation applications.Keywords: endo- β-1,4-glucanase; Escherichia coli ; expression; characterization; oligosaccharide; sacchariﬁcation 1.
Introduction Cellulose is the principal component of plant lignocellulose; it is a polysaccharide composed of glucose linked by β-1,4-bonds [ 1]. Among the organic compounds on earth, polysaccharides are the most abundant, and their decomposition into smaller fragments, such as monosaccharides and oligosaccharides is a necessary condition for effective utiliza- tion of polysaccharides [ 2].Oligosaccharide is a linear or branched low-polymerization sugar composed of two to ten monosaccharide components connected by different glyco- sidic bonds.Researchers have found that oligosaccharides have a prebiotic effect, which not only promotes the growth of beneﬁcial intestinal bacteria and affects the composition of the microbiota but also enhances the immune function of the body, playing an important role in physiological functions [3,4].Cellulose degradation involves the coordination of multiple enzymes with different functions to degrade glucan into glucose.
First, endoglucanase freely cuts the glycosidic bond at the nonreducing end of the amorphous region of the cellulose chain to produce oligomers of different lengths; then, exglucanase hydrolyzes cellobiose from the oligomers, and β-glucosidase hydrolyzes cellobiose to glucose. The three enzymes generally work together to complete the hydrolysis of cellulose [ 5].Endo- β-1,4-glucanases (E.C.3.2.1.4) have garnered considerable attention due to their ability to hydrolyze long cellulose chains into small molecular fragments.So far, cellulase has Foods 2023 ,12, 2517.https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12132517 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods Foods 2023 ,12, 2517 2 of 14 been employed in different industrial ﬁelds, such as improving the digestibility of low- quality feed and extracting oligosaccharides from agricultural by-products and agricultural residues for use as prebiotics [6,7].In industrial applications, enzyme production is the most critical and costly step.
In nature, numerous microorganisms produce endonucleases, such as fungi, bacteria, and actinomycetes [ 8]. Myxobacteria are gliding Gram-negative bacteria with multicellular behavior, characterized by the ability to degrade biological macromolecules [ 9–11].Of the two groups of myxobacteria, one can lyse the living cells of other microorganisms, while the other can efﬁciently break down cellulose [ 11].Because enzyme yield and activity of wild- type strains are often very low, the heterologous expression has become an important means of functional characterization, inexpensive production, and high-efﬁciency lignocellulose sacchariﬁcation [ 12].Endo- β-1,4-glucanases are present in at least 16 glycoside hydrolase families, of which GH6 is considered the most studied in terms of gene function and enzyme characterization [ 13].GH6 endo- β-1,4-glucanases mainly exist in bacteria [ 14].Until now, only a few GH6 endo- β-1,4-glucanases have exhibited heterologous expression.
We previously isolated and identiﬁed a strain of Myxococcus sp. B6-1 from the soil.In this study, a novel endo- β-1,4-glucanase gene from Myxococcus sp.B6-1 was cloned and expressed in E.coli.We further investigated the biochemical characteristics and straw sacchariﬁcation ability of recombinant enzymes.To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of GH6 cellulase from Myxococcus sp.2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Chemicals, Strains, and Media Glucose and other cello-oligosaccharide (G 2-G5), carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC), barley β-glucan, laminarin, xylan (from corncob), avicel, chitosan, and ﬁlter paper were obtained from McLean Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd.(Shanghai, China), whereas lichenin was purchased from Megazyme (Bray, Ireland).Other chemicals used in this study were provided by Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China).Myxococcus sp.B6-1 was isolated from soil and cultured in a lysogeny broth (LB).DH5 and BL21 (DE3) strains of E.
coli from our laboratory were respectively utilized for gene cloning and expression. Plasmid pET-29a (Takara, Beijing, China) was used for expression.2.2.Gene Cloning, Expression, and Puriﬁcation of CelA257 The DNA of genomic organisms was isolated from Myxococcus sp.B6-1 and ex- tracted using a previously described method [ 15].The endoglucanase gene CelA257 (GenBank registration number: MW248127) was amplified with the primers: Cel257F (5′- TAAGAAGGAGATATA CATATG TGGCTCGCGGCCTCG-3′) and Cel257 R(5′- GTGGTGGTGGTGGTG CTCGAG CGTACCGTCGATGAG-3′).PCR program included denaturation at 98◦C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles: denaturation at 98◦C for 10 s, annealing at 65◦C for 5 s, polymerization at 72◦C for 10 s, with a ﬁnal extension at 72◦C for 10 min.PCR products were puriﬁed, digested with NdeI and XhoI, and ligated into a pET-29a(+) vector to form pET-29a- CelA257 .Following plasmid transformation into competent E.coli DH5 α, positive transformants were isolated and sequenced.
A veriﬁed recombinant plasmid was cultured on a LB medium containing kanamycin 50 mg/mL at 37◦C in E. coli BL21 (DE3).Isopropyl- β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) solution (0.2 mM) was induced for protein overexpression until OD 600of strain reached 0.5–0.6.Following that, recombinant strain cells were gathered and lysed after being centrifuged at 8000×g for 20 min.After ultrasonic fragmentation (fragmentation conditions: 300 W, 70 times, ultrasound for 5 s, gap for 5 s, total time of 10 min), centrifugation was performed at 12,000 r/min and 4◦C for 15 min.The supernatant of recombinant CelA257 with a 6-His tag was puriﬁed with a Ni-NTA column and eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) con- taining various imidazole concentrations (50–400 mM).Bradford’s method was used to determine the protein concentration [ 15], and the 10% SDS-PAGE was used to analyze the eluted protein.Foods 2023 ,12, 2517 3 of 14 2.3.
Sequence Analysis and Homology Modeling of CelA257 Calculations were performed to determine the molecular mass and the isoelectric point of the compound using the Expasy tool (https://web.expasy.org, accessed on 23 July 2020). The protein sequence was analyzed using the NCBI database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, accessed on 23 July 2020), and the sequence of amino acids analysis of CelA257 to other sequences was conducted by Clustal omega tools.Domains of structural and active sites were predicted using the Pfam database.Mega 5.0 Software and the Poisson model adjacency method were used to construct the phylogenetic tree.In addition, a 3D protein structural model of CelA257 was generated by the alpha fold2 online server (https://cryonet.ai/af2, accessed on 16 April 2021), and the structure of the active site was generated using Cel6 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PDB: 1UP3) as a template.Cel6 shared 42% identity and 60% query cover with the CelA257 sequence.
Molecular graphics software PyMol was used to visualize the crystal 3D structure model. 2.4.Enzyme Assay CMC (0.5%, w/v) was dissolved in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and incubated with enzyme for 1 h at 50◦C to determine enzyme activity The reducing sugar was determined according to the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method [ 16].For the substrate activity, 0.5% ( w/v) barley β-glucan, lichenan, PASC, laminarin, avicel, ﬁlter paper, xy- lan, and chitosan were utilized.Triplicates of all experiments were performed.Chitosan substrate was prepared as previously described [ 17].The amount of enzyme required to produce one µmol of reducing sugar per minute was deﬁned as an enzyme unit.Chi- tosanase activity was determined using glucosamine as a standard, while other enzyme activities were determined using glucose as a standard.2.5.
Biochemical Properties of CelA257 CelA257 was tested in different buffers (with pH 3.0–10.5) to determine its optimal pH, including citrate buffer (pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0), sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5), tris-HCl buffer (pH 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9), and glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9, 9.5, 10.0, 10.5). Various buffers (pH 3.0–10.5) were incubated at 4◦C for 24 h with aliquots of recombinant CelA257 in order to determine pH stability.The optimal reaction temperature was identiﬁed using a wide range of temperatures (4–100◦C) in pH 6.5 sodium phosphate buffer for 1 h.CelA257′s thermal stability was analyzed by depositing the solution in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at 30–60◦C for 48 h.The impact of various metal ions (1 mM) and chemicals was measured in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5).Reactants without any metal ions and chemicals were employed as controls, and the enzyme activity was considered 100%.
To obtain the enzyme’s kinetic parameters, enzyme activity was determined using various CMC concentrations (1.2–4.0 mg/mL) in phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at 50◦C for 1 h. The data were graphed using the Lineweaver–Burk method.2.6.Hydrolytic Cello-Oligosaccharide Products Analysis The hydrolysis mode of CelA257 was conﬁrmed by hydrolyzing 1 mg/mL cello- oligosaccharides (G 2-G5) in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at 50◦C with 0.1 U CelA257.The samples were withdrawn after 6 and 12 h and boiled separately for 10 min.Following that, an analysis of the end products was conducted by thin layer liquid chromatography method (TLC).The ﬁnal products of the reaction were applied onto silicone glass plates from Merck, Germany.These plates were then treated with a solvent system consisting of n-butanol, water, and acetic acid in a 2:1:1 v/v/vratio.The solution was visualized by spraying with sulfuric/methanol acid (1:4, v/v) and heating at 85◦C for 15 min.2.7.
Agricultural Straw Sacchariﬁcation Different agricultural straws at 1% ( w/v) were crushed through a 40-mesh sieve followed by blending in 20 mM PBS buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0 or 0.45 U crude CelA257 enzyme. Then the mixture was transferred to a 10 mL centrifuge tube, shaken at 50◦C Foods 2023 ,12, 2517 4 of 14 for 48 h, and then boiled for 10 min, followed by centrifugation.The supernatants were utilized to determine the released reducing sugars of the reaction product using the DNS method.Finally, the number of milligrams of the reducing sugar released per milliliter of the reaction system was calculated.3.Results and Discussion 3.1.Cloning and Analysis of CelA257 Sequence Sequence alignment analysis of endo- β-1,4-glucanase gene CelA257 revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 1404 bp length that encoded 467 amino acids with the ﬁrst 11 amino acids as a signal peptide sequence.Therefore, CelA257 must be an extracellular enzyme.
The signal peptide was removed during heterologous expression. The theoretical pI was 5.01, and the predicted molecular mass was 48.7 kDa.Additionally, the phylogenic tree (Figure 1a) demonstrated that CelA257 was on the same branch as CelA1 from Strepto- myces halstedii (NCBI Accession No.P33682.2).BLAST analysis manifested that CelA257 shared 54.7% of its identity with CelA1 from Streptomyces halstedii [18], followed by cusA from Streptomyces sp.KSM-9 (43.6%, P13933.3) [ 19], CenA from Cellulomonas ﬁmi (43.3%, P07984.1) [ 20], E2 from Thermobiﬁda fusca (40.8%, P26222.2) [ 21], and shared <40% of the sequence identity with other bacteria in GenBank database.The results indicated that CelA257 is a new GH6 endoglucanase.To effectively degrade cellulose, microorganisms typically produce a variety of endogenous and exogenous glycoside hydrolases (GH) [ 22].
Therefore, the carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZY) database classiﬁes them functionally based on sequence similarity and structural properties [ 23]. These enzymes are classiﬁed into GH5, GH6, GH7, GH8, GH9, GH12, GH44, GH45, GH48, GH74, and GH124 families.However, despite the genetic and structural characterization of approximately 20 GH6 endo-b-1,4-glucanase genes and the availability of three crystal structures, reports on the biochemical and enzymatic properties of microbial endo-b-1,4-glucanases in the GH6 family are relatively limited [13].Foods 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 15 from Merck, Germany.These plates were then treated with a solvent system consisting of n-butanol, water, and acetic acid in a 2:1:1 v/v/v ratio.The solution was visualized by spraying with sulfuric/methanol acid (1:4, v/v) and heating at 85 °C for 15 min.2.7.
Agricultural Straw Sacchari ﬁcation Diﬀerent agricultural straws at 1% ( w/v) were crushed through a 40-mesh sieve followed by blending in 20 mM PBS bu ﬀer (pH 6.5) containing 0 or 0.45 U crude CelA257 enzyme. Then the mixture was transferred to a 10 mL centrifuge tube, shaken at 50 °C for 48 h, and then boiled for 10 min, followed by centrifugation.The supernatants were utilized to determine the released reducing sugars of the reaction product using the DNS method.Finally, the number of milligrams of the reducing sugar released per milliliter of the reaction system was calculated.3.Results and Discussion 3.1.Cloning and Analysis of CelA257 Sequence Sequence alignment analysis of endo- β-1,4-glucanase gene CelA257 revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 1404 bp length that encoded 467 amino acids with the ﬁrst amino acids as a signal peptide sequence.Therefore, CelA257 must be an extracellular enzyme.The signal peptide was removed during hetero logous expression.
The theoretical pI was 5.01, and the predicted molecular mass was 48 .7 kDa. Additionally, the phylogenic tree (Figure 1a) demonstrated that CelA257 was on the same branch as CelA1 from Streptomyces halstedii (NCBI Accession No.P33682.2).BLAST analysis manifested that CelA257 shared 54.7% of its identity with CelA1 from Streptomyces halstedii [18], followed by cusA from Streptomyces sp.KSM-9 (43.6%, P13933.3) [19], CenA from Cellulomonas ﬁmi (43.3%, P07984.1) [20], E2 from Thermobi ﬁda fusca (40.8%, P26222.2) [21], and shared <40% of the sequence identity with other bacteria in GenBank database.The results indicated that CelA257 is a new GH6 endoglucanase.To e ﬀectively degrade cellulose, microorganisms typically produce a variety of endogenous and exogenous glycoside hydrolases (GH) [22].Therefore, the carb ohydrate active enzyme (CAZY) database classi ﬁes them functionally based on sequence si milarity and structural properties [23].
These enzymes are classi ﬁed into GH5, GH6, GH7, GH8, GH9, GH12, GH44, GH45, GH48, GH74, and GH124 families. However, despite the genetic and structural characterization of approximately 20 GH6 endo-b-1,4-glucanase genes and the availability of three crystal structures, reports on the biochemical and en zymatic properties of microbial endo-b-1,4- glucanases in the GH6 family are relatively limited [13].(a) Thermobifida fusca E2 (P26222.2) Thermobispora bispora CelA (P26414.1) Streptomyces sp .KSM-9 CasA (P13933.3) Streptomyces halstedii CelA1 (P33682.2) Myxococcus sp.B6-1 CelA257 (MW248127) Cellulomonas fimi CenA (P07984.1) Humicola insolens Cel6B (Q7SIG5.1) Podospora anserine S mat+ PaCel6A (B2ADA5.1) Aspergillus fumigatus A1163 cbhc (B0XWL3.1) Aspergillus fischeri NRRL 181 cbhc (A1DJQ7.1) Streptomyces reticuli cel1 (Q05156.1)100 100 100 99 99 976051 0.2 Figure 1.Cont .Foods 2023 ,12, 2517 5 of 14 Foods 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 15 (b) (c) Figure 1.

The red boxes denote active sites, and the blue boxes depict conserved amino acid sequences. An asterisk stands for a completely position of the residue.CelA257 was predicted using the Pfam database to have structural domains from the CBM4-9 and GH6 families (Figure 1b).The amino acid sequence multiple alignment analy- sis showed three conserved sequences: 247–264 (region I), 329–340 (region II), and 358–405 Foods 2023 ,12, 2517 6 of 14 (region III) (Figure 1c) [ 24].Aspartic acid was reported to be a highly conserved amino acid residue required for GH6 enzyme catalytic activity, while Asp256, Asp294, and Asp441 were inferred as active sites of the endoglucanase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [25].Protein 3D modeling results revealed a narrow tunnel in the center of CelA257, where the active site was located (Figure S1c).
CelA257 contains a typical ( β/α) 8-barrel structure of the GH6 family (Figure S1d), which includes endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) [ 25], cellobio- hydrolase (EC 3.2.1.91) [ 26], and lichenase/endo- β-1,3-1,4-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.73) [ 14]. CelA257 active center was composed of three aspartic acid residues (Figure S1e,f), with Asp441 acting as the catalytic nucleophile and Asp294 as a proton donor [ 18].The deduced N-terminal binding domain was analyzed as a member of the CBM4-9 family.The domain shared only 32.06% of its identity with cellulose-binding domain (CBD N1) from Cellulomonas ﬁmiand comprised a typical jelly-roll-sandwich with two antiparallel β-sheets [27].3.2.Expression and Puriﬁcation of CelA257 The CelA257 gene was successfully expressed in E.coli .SDS-PAGE analysis of re- combinant CelA257 soluble expression induced by IPTG was shown in the supernatant (Figure 2).Additionally, CelA257 was successfully puriﬁed using the Ni-NTA afﬁnity column.
After puriﬁcation, CelA257 had a 16-fold increase in a speciﬁc activity (3.1 U/mg) with a 70.1% yield. We presumed that the low amount of recombinant enzyme production was due to the high G+C content (70.23%) in the DNA sequence.As a result, to obtain higher protein recovery, it is necessary to conduct codon optimization to improve gene expression in the following study.The molecular weight display result analyzed from SDS-PAGE (49 kDa) was in agreement with the predicted value (48.7 kDa).The molecular mass of CelA257 is slightly larger than PaCel6B (41.3 kDa) from Podospora anserine [28], smaller than CelL (56.0 kDa) from Cellulosimicrobium funkei HY-13 [ 13], and Cel6A (53.0 kDa) from Cellulomonas pachnodae [29].These are both endo- β-1,4-glucanases containing a GH6 catalytic domain, whereas CelA257 comprises an additional CBM4-9 domain.
Microbial glycoside hydrolases typically have a modular structure consisting of at least one catalytic domain (CD) connected to single or multiple carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) via a ﬂexible connection region [ 30]. CBMs attach enzymes to the substrate surface, enhancing catalytic activity by increasing local enzyme concentration and potentially disrupting sur- face structure for more efﬁcient catalysis, or targeting enzymes to speciﬁc substrates [ 31–33].The binding of cellulase to cellulose is thought to be a step that limits cellulose hydrolysis, so CBMs are a key component of these modular cellulolytic proteins [ 34].It was reported that CBM4-9 can bind to crystalline cellulose [35].3.3.Characteristics of Recombinant CelA257 The optimum pH of CelA257 was 6.5 (Figure 3).The activity of CelA257 was greater than 50% at pH 5–9 and greater than 20% at pH 3 and 9.5.
CelA257′s optimum pH was slightly higher than CelL (pH 5) from Cellulosimicrobium funkei HY-13 [ 13] and Cel6A (pH 5.5) from C. pachnodae [29], but lower than PaCel6B (pH 7–9) from Podospora anserina [28] and EG VI from Humicola insolens [36].For pH stability, after 24 h incubation, the residual enzyme activity of CelA257 was more than 60% at pH 6–8.The optimum temperature (50◦C) was comparable to most GH6 endoglucanases.When incubated at 50◦C for 2 h, CelA257 remained at >50% activity, making it more thermostable than CelL (12 h).The main problems encountered by enzymes in commercial production and industrial applications include narrow pH ranges, inaccessibility of enzymes and substrates, thermal stability, end- product inhibition, and enzyme production costs [ 37].After enzymatic characterization, CelA257 exerted a wide range of pH stability and temperature stability.These enzymatic properties provide favorable preconditions for industrial applications.

The optimum temperature (50 °C) was comparable to most GH6 endoglucanases. When incubated at 50 °C for 2 h, CelA257 remained at >50% activity, making it more thermostable than CelL (12 h).The main problems encountered by enzymes in commercial production and industrial applications include narrow pH ranges, inaccessibility of enzymes and substrates, thermal stability, end-product inhibition, and enzyme production costs [37].After enzymatic characterization, CelA257 exerted a wide range of pH stability and temperature stability.These enzymatic properties provide favorable preconditions for indu strial applications.CelA257 activity was raised by 1 mM Co 2+ and Mn2+ to 128% and 131%, respectively (Figure 4).It was similar to CelL: the two metal ions both activated the enzyme activity slightly, while 5 mM Co2+ inhibited more than 50% of the activity of Cel6H-p35 and Cel6H- p23 from a compost metagenomic library [38].
Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+ inhibited the activity to less than 60%, whereas the activity was only slightly inhibited by the other metal ions. In the presence of metal ions, the structure of the enzyme will change so that the activity of the enzyme will be activated or inhibited [3 9].Therefore, in practical applications, the concentration of metal ions in the environment where the enzyme is added should be measured.In addition, most chemicals inhibited the activity to 50–80%, including 10% (v/v) methanol, acetonitrile, isopropanol, ethanol, 20 mg/mL tritonX-100, tween 80, 10 mM EDTA, and 2 mg/mL SDS.The residual acti vity remained more than 80% when 10% acetone and 5% DMSO were added.Figure 2.Expression and puriﬁcation of CelA257.M: protein marker; lane 1: crude enzyme liquid of the supernatant of BL21 (DE3) cell lysate containing pET-29a; lane 2: crude enzyme liquid of the supernatant of recombinant strain cell lysate induced by IPTG; lane 3: puriﬁed CelA257.

The results are similar to those obtained with other GH6 endoglucanases; however, they are both endo- β-1,4-glucanases, not lichenases, because Figure 3.

Therefore, in practical applications, the concentration of metal ions in the environment where the enzyme is added should be measured. In addition, most chemicals inhibited the activity to 50–80%, including 10% ( v/v) methanol, acetonitrile, isopropanol, ethanol, 20 mg/mL tritonX-100, tween 80, 10 mM EDTA, and 2 mg/mL SDS.The residual activity remained more than 80% when 10% acetone and 5% DMSO were added.Foods 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 15 Figure 3.Optimum pH, temperature, and stability of CelA257: ( a) optimal pH; ( b) pH stability; ( c) optimum temperature; ( d) thermostability.Figure 4.Eﬀect of metal irons ( a) and compounds ( b) on the activity of CelA257.3.4.Substrate Speci ﬁcity of CelA257 CelA257 was relatively highly active against CMC (3.64 U/mg), barley β-glucan (17.58 U/mg), lichenan (6.49 U/mg), PASC (2.42 U/mg), and avicel (2.82 U/mg), but was inactive against chitosan (0.72 U/mg), laminarin (0.78 U/mg), and ﬁlter paper (0.54 U/mg) (Table 1).

CelA257 exerted efﬁcient activity toward barley β-glucan, followed by lichenan, which contains mixed β-1,3-1,4-glucan linkages. The results are similar to those obtained with other GH6 endoglucanases; however, they are both endo- β-1,4-glucanases, not lichenases, because they hydrolyze only β-1,3-1,4-glucan linkages [ 40].In addition, CelA257 exhibited chitosan and laminarin activity that was distinct from that of other GH6 endoglucanases.Insoluble cellulose avicel was degraded by CelA257, and the speciﬁc activity (2.8 U/mg) was higher than in CelL (0.6 U/mg) and Pacel6B (2.3 U/mg) (Table 2).It was reported that truncated Cel6D showed tiny activity to PASC and no activity to avicel; however, full-length Cel6D with CBM3 showed activity to avicel [ 41].CBM 4-9 was conﬁrmed to be necessary for crystalline cellulose hydrolysis of many microbial endo- β-1,4-glucanases [ 42].
We proposed that an additional carbohydrate-binding module of CelA257 can also promote the binding afﬁnity to crystalline cellulose, hence increasing catalytic efﬁciency.

The results suggested that CBM4-9 probably improved the binding to crystalline cellulose but not soluble cellulose, such as CMC. 3.5.Hydrolytic Cello-Oligosaccharide Products Analysis The model of CelA257 was analyzed by degrading cello-oligosaccharides, and the hy- drolyzed products were analyzed by TLC (Figure 5).CelA257 hydrolyzed cello-oligosaccharides G4and G 5rapidly at 6 h but did not hydrolyze G 2and G 3under reaction conditions.CelA257 hydrolyzed both G 4and G 5to G 2and G 3.The results were similar to Cel6H-p35 from a compost metagenomic library.When Cel6H-p35 and CMC reacted for 12 or 24 h, Cel6H-p35 hydrolyzed cello-oligosaccharide G 5to G 2and G 3and G 4to G 2but hardly hydrolyzed G 3[38].It was suggested that CelA257 and Cel6H-p35 exerted the same modes of hydrolysis and that CelA257 was an endo-type cellulase.Foods 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 15 Figure 5.TLC analysis of CelA257 hydrolytic cello-oligosaccharide products (G 2–G 5) for 6 and 12 h, respectively.

In th e industrial production of ethanol, endo- β- 1,4-glucanase is an important enzyme to saccharify lignocellulosic biomass since it degrades long cellulose chains into shorter chai ns to facilitate subseque nt hydrolysis. It is reported that using BGlc8H with extensive substrate speci ﬁcity has improved the sacchari ﬁcation of pretreated reed and rice st raw [44].As a result, the sacchari ﬁcation eﬀects of pretreated biomass with CelA257 will also be further investigated.For monogastric animals, beta-glucan is a substance that is di ﬃcult to digest, and adding cellulase can overcome the anti-nutritional factors of beta-glucan.With the further study of functional oligosaccharides, the e ﬀect of cello-oligosaccharides on the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria has been con ﬁrmed [45].In addition, the e ﬀects of oligosaccharides on the physiological function of the body have also been more extensively studied and reported.
In this experiment, the yield of oligosaccharides added with CelA257 to di ﬀerent straw powders was not further determined, and more in-depth studies will be conducted. Moreover, the synergistic e ﬀects of CelA257 with other endoglucanases, exoglucanases, and glucanases should be further investigated in the future.This study provides for a potential application of CelA257 as a pretreatment additive in biomass sacchari ﬁcation.Figure 5.TLC analysis of CelA257 hydrolytic cello-oligosaccharide products (G 2–G5) for 6 and 12 h, respectively.( a–d) stand for the products of CelA257 reaction with G 2, G3, G4, and G 5, respectively.E2, E3, E4, and E5 stand for the reaction samples of CelA257 with G 2, G3, G4, and G 5, respectively.(Gn): Reference material including glucose (G 1), cellobiose (G 2), cellotriose (G 3), cellotetraose (G 4), and cellopentose (G 5).Foods 2023 ,12, 2517 10 of 14 3.6.

CelA257 was stable at temperatures ranging from 4 to 50◦C and pH ranging from 6 to 9.5. The results of oligosaccharide hydrolysis indicated that CelA257 is an endo-type cellulase.CelA257 exerted broad substrate speciﬁcity and high activity to crystalline cellu- lose.CelA257 was added to agricultural straws to increase their sacchariﬁcation efﬁciency.These ﬁndings suggested that it may be used as a biomass sacchariﬁcation supplement.Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/foods12132517/s1, Figure S1: Three-dimensional structural model of CelA257 protein.Figure S2: Lineweaver–Burk plots of CelA257 using CMC as substrate.Author Contributions: Methodology, F.W.; software, L.D.; validation, Z.H.; formal analysis, W.Z.and S.F.; investigation, L.D.; resources, G.N.; data curation, Z.H.; writing—original draft, Z.H.; writing—review and editing, F.W.; funding acquisition, G.N.
