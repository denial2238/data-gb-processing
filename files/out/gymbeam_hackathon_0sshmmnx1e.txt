A Dermonutrient Containing Special Collagen Peptides Improves Skin Structure and Function: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Triple-Blind Trial Using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy on the Cosmetic Effects and Tolerance of a Drinkable Collagen Supplement Sabrina Laing, Stephan Bielfeldt, Carolin Ehrenberg, and Klaus-Peter Wilhelm proDERM Institute for Applied Dermatological Research, Schenefeld-Hamburg, Germany.ABSTRACT The purpose of this randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind trial on 60 healthy female volunteers was to assess the cosmetic effects on skin quality of a food supplement containing special collagen peptides together with acerola extract, vitamin C, vitamin E, biotin, and zinc after an intake of 12 weeks (Elasten/C210, QUIRIS Healthcare, Germany).
To reduce assessment bias maximally and increase the accuracy and objectivity of the outcomes, the trial design was tripleblinded in a manner that neither the subjects nor the person administering the products nor the person who assessed the primary outcomes knew which subjects had received the test product and which had received the placebo. The expert grader assessing the confocal laser scanning microscopy images was additionally blinded regarding the time when the image wastaken (on days 1 or 85).The objective, blinded, and validated image analyses using confocal laser scanning microscopyshowed a signiﬁcant improvement of the collagen structure of facial skin (primary endpoint) after intake of the test product, while no improvements were found after intake of the placebo.
The proven positive nutritional effect on the collagen structure was fully consistent with positive subjective evaluations of relevant skin parameters such as elasticity, crinkliness/wrinkliness,and evenness in different body areas such as face, hands, de ´collete ´, neck, backside, legs, and belly, all serving as secondary endpoints. The test product was found to be safe and very well tolerated.A cosmetically relevant improvement of the facial skin was demonstrated after administration of the collagen supplement.KEYWORDS: /C15antiaging /C15collagen peptides /C15dermal collagen structure /C15dermonutrient /C15oral collagen supplement /C15skin beauty INTRODUCTION The environment as well as stress and chronological aging can induce irreversible, and also reversible, changes in the structural components of the skin that lead tovisible signs of aging such as increased dryness and wrinkleformation.
1–3The appearance of the skin depends to a large extent on the homeostasis of the dermal extracellular matrixthat is primarily deﬁned by collagen and similar ﬁbers. 4 Orally administered collagen peptides and synergisticallyacting dermonutrients can reach the deeper layer of the skinand stimulate the endogenous production of extracellular matrix components in the skin.5These oligopeptides arederived from an enzymatic hydrolysis leading to highly bioavailable and thus bioactive short-chain collagen pep- tides that are able to induce beneﬁcial cosmetic effects.6The purpose of this study was to investigate the cosmetic effectof a collagen supplement on the appearance of skin inhealthy women.MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design and ethical aspects The study was performed using a randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled, and double-blind design follow-ing the principles of Good Clinical Practice.The study wasregistered in the German Clinical Trial Register and theICTRP (no.
DRKS00017093). The investigation was in fullcompliance with the principles outlined in the Declarationof Helsinki and with national regulations.A written decla-ration of informed consent was received from all volunteers.The trial protocol was approved by the Freiburg EthicsCommittee International on December 18, 2017.Address correspondence to: Stephan Bielfeldt, Dipl Ing, proDERM Institute for Applied Dermatological Research, Kiebitzweg 2, Schenefeld-Hamburg D-22869, Germany, E-mail: sbielfeldt@proderm.de #Sabrina Laing et al.2020; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

All participants ﬁnished the study without major protocol deviations.
The main ex-clusion criteria were active skin diseases at the measurementarea, systemic therapy with i mmunosuppressive drugs, anti- phlogistic agents, analgesic dr ugs, antihistamines or antibiot- ics, or topical medication at the measurement site before the start of the study and/or throughout the entire course of the study, and intensive use of skin care products at the mea-surement site within 1 month before the start of the study. Participants were instructed not to apply any leave-on or decorative cosmetics on the measurement site in the morn-ing before the start of the study, to maintain their livinghabits, and not to begin or change any estrogen or proges-terone therapy.Any intake of other products, which mayhave an effect on the skin during the study, was not allowed.
Study schedule Eighty-four units (drinking ampoules) of the study product (25 mL per unit) were provided to each participant.The products were to be taken by the subjects at home, oncea day before or together with a meal, for 12 weeks. As-sessment times were the day before the ﬁrst intake (day 1)and the day after 12 weeks of intake (day 85).Complianceand tolerability were monitored on days 29, 57, and 85.Efﬁcacy data were collected at the end of the study.Test materials The study product is classiﬁed as a food supplement.Both the test product and placebo were delivered in identicaldrinking ampoules.The test product (Elasten /C210, QUIRIS Healthcare) contained 2.5 g speciﬁc short-chain collagenoligopeptides, 666 mg acerola fruit extract, 80 mg vitaminC, 3 mg zinc citrate, 2.3 mg vitamin E, and 50 lg biotin.Additional ingredients also contained in the placebo prep-aration included potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, car- boxymethylcellulose, citric acid, natural aroma, and water.
The placebo did not contain any nutrients. Test product andplacebo were randomly assigned to two equally sized studyarms (30 participants in each).Confocal microscopy The collagen structure ( i.e., the fragmentation of collagen in the reticular dermis) was assessed by confocal laserscanning microscopy (VIVASCOPE 1500; Lucid, Inc., Rochester, NY, USA), which allows the cellular micro- structure to be visualized in 5 lm horizontal optical cross sections of the epidermis and the dermis with a maximaldepth of 200 lm.7The skin can be imaged in vivo in its native state without further preparation.This method en-ables an in vivo mapping of the skin since the different microstructures within the skin cause natural variations ofthe refraction index.For example, cytoplasm with a re-fraction index close to that of water (reﬂectance index 1.33)is depicted with a very low contrast.Melanin and keratin(reﬂectance index 1.7) have a higher refraction index and thereby act as natural contrast agents.
The optical sectionresolution is 5 lm with an image size of 500 ·500lm. The test area was also captured with a macrocamera, which al-lowed correlated confocal and photographic images.All measurements were done on the cheeks after an acclimati- zation period of at least 30 min in a climatized room(21–1/C176C and 50 –5% relative humidity) under highly standardized conditions.If necessary, facial hairs werecarefully removed with a clipper by a technician 30 minbefore the measurement was taken.Collagen structure The collagen structure, the appearance of which is de- termined by the relationship between reticulated, coarse,huddled, and curled collagen ﬁbers, changes with age.Young-looking healthy skin mostly shows thin reticulatedﬁbers.With aging, the proportion of thin reticulated ﬁbersprogressively decreases, in favor of coarse and huddledcollagen ﬁbers.In addition, the proportion of bright curledﬁbers progressively increases in older people.
8 Such changes are clearly recognizable in confocal im- ages. With age, the dermal collagen network becomes in-creasingly fragmented, which is characterized by shorterand less organized ﬁbers and accumulating degraded col-lagen fragments.The younger and healthier the skin, thelarger, more diffuse, and less fragmented are the collagenstructures.Differences between confocal images taken be-fore and after the intervention were assessed by an expertgrader, based on the degree of collagen fragmentation.Thecollagen structure was assessed using at least three uni-formly distributed stacks over the measurement area in the face, starting within the stratum corneum with up to 40 repetitions at 5 lm scanning steps.Confocal images tar- geting the area of the collagen network were chosen foranalysis.
Images taken on days 1 and 85 were compared on acomputer screen in a validated, blinded, and left/right ran-domized manner by the expert grader on a visual analogscale (VAS) from -50 (=left image better) to +50 (=right image better) (Fig. 1).For details of the blinding procedure,see chapter 2.8.FIG.1.Assessment of the appearance of the collagen structure by expert graders using images of confocal laser scanning microscopy (VIVASCOPE).148 LAING ET AL.Subjective evaluation Subjective assessments of product traits and cosmetic effectiveness on the quality of the skin were recorded on day85 using a questionnaire.
The general evaluation of producteffects on the skin was covered using 15 questions/state-ments concerning the improvement of the following criteria:dryness, scaliness, elasticity, complexion, ﬁrmness, crink-liness, radiance, evenness, softness, healthiness and sup- pleness of the skin, the need for external care products, the perception of a high product effect, the perception of astrong product effect, the evaluation of skin changes noticedby people in the participants‘ personal environment, and thegeneral satisfaction with the product. Furthermore, thepositive product effects (less dry, fewer wrinkles/scales,more radiant/even/supple, softer, healthier, ﬁrmer) wererelated to one or more of the body areas (face, hands,de´collete ´, neck, backside, legs, belly) at the end of the study.The tolerability and digestibility of the product, as well as the sensitivity of the skin, were also assessed at the end of the study.
Adverse events or severe adverse events and changes in concomitant therapy, as well as compliancechecks, had to be documented on days 29, 57, and 85. Blinding The triple-blinded procedure was chosen to maximally reduce assessment bias and to increase the accuracy andobjectivity of the outcomes.The trial design was triple-blinded in a manner that neither the subject nor the personadministering the products nor the person who assessed theprimary outcomes knew which subjects had received the testproduct and which had received a placebo.The expert gra-der of the confocal laser scanning microscopy images was additionally blinded regarding the time when the image was taken (on days 1 or 85).Statistical analyses Safety and tolerance data listing was based on the safety population (intention to treat population), which included alltrial participants who were enrolled into the study and whoreceived at least the ﬁrst dose of the study intervention.
Theefﬁcacy analysis was based on the per-protocol population,including all subjects randomized in the study in accordancewith both the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who ﬁn-ished the study according to the protocol without any majorprotocol violations and who had not withdrawn their consent. The primary endpoint of the study was deﬁned as the change in the collagen structure.The mean value of at least three image gradings per subject was used as raw data forfurther statistical analyses and comparison of placebo andverum.For the descriptive data analysis of the collagenstructure, number of individuals (N), means, standard devi-ations, and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) of all subjects werecalculated.Bar charts with mean values and 95% CIs werecreated to compare the placebo and verum interventions.
Forthe primary analysis, a t-test for independent samples with a signiﬁcance level of a=0.05 was conducted on the raw data.The secondary endpoint was the trial participants’ sub- jective assessment of product effects on the quality of theskin by the subjects enrolled in this controlled study. Withinthe context of a descriptive data analysis, a signiﬁcancelevel of 0.05 ( a) was chosen for statistical analysis.Counts, percentages, and means of scores were provided for all parameters of the questionnair e.For the parameter colla- gen structure, pairwise comparisons of postinterventionassessment and baseline were performed on the raw datafor each intervention separately with paired t-tests versus the benchmark of 0 (no differences between assessmenttimes).The parameters of the subjective assessmentsserving as the secondary endpoint were analyzed using theMann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test fo r pairwise comparison of the study groups.
Statistical analyses were performed according to the principles of the ICH guideline E9 ‘‘Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials’’ using the SAS software, version 9.4 forWindows, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA. RESULTS CONSORT ﬂow diagram of the controlled interventional trial Sixty trial participants with a mean age of 54.4 –7.5 years were statistically analyzed.No trial participants had to be excluded during screening or at any point in the study.Thestudy population and the per-protocol population wereidentical ( n=60).The ﬂow of subjects through the con- trolled interventional trial is depicted in a CONSORT(Consolidated Statement of Reporting Trials) conform dia-gram (Fig.2).The study was conducted as a two-arm interventional trial of the test product against placebo for 12 weeks.All enrolledsubjects were examined before the ﬁrst intake of test productor placebo (day 1) and after 12 weeks of intake of test product or placebo (day 85).
The safety and efﬁcacy of the test product compared with placebo could be conﬁrmed forthe entire study population. Analyses of collagen structure by confocal microscopy The application of the confocal laser scanning microscopy procedure provides the opportunity to visualize the collagenstructure in the subcutaneous tissue in vivo .This method allows a demonstration of the inﬂuence of an oral collagensupplement not only on skin characteristics but also espe- cially on the presence of collagen ﬁbers as the most impor- tant structural protein of the skin.
With the help of a blindedexpert grader analyzing such randomly presented micros-copy images taken before and after 12 weeks of supple-mentation of placebo and the test product, a signiﬁcantimprovement of the collagen structure of the facial skincould be demonstrated in response to the test product.Figure 3 shows the different appearances of the collagenstructure on day 1 and on day 85 using the example of a singlesubject (RD47) from the active ( verum) intervention group:EFFECTS OF A DERMONUTRIENT ON SKIN PHYSIOLOGY 149 the evaluation of the collagen structure ( i.e.,d e g r e eo fc o l l a - gen fragmentation) for day 85 (right image) was considerably improved, reﬂected by an expert rating of +27 within the VAS range of between -50 (left image much better) and +50 (right image much better). Both the intragroup changes and the intergroup differ- ences conﬁrmed the positive effect of the test product on thehuman skin.
The collagen structure and therefore the qualityof the dermis were signiﬁcantly improved on day 85 com-pared with benchmark 0 on day 1 after intake of the testproduct. In contrast, no signiﬁcant difference to benchmark0 was detected for placebo.As such, the comparison of treatments revealed a signiﬁcantly better outcome for the test product than for placebo.Figure 4 demonstrates the improvement of the facial collagen structure by the testproduct compared with placebo.Intake of placebo resultedin a slight but not signiﬁcant deterioration of the collagenstructure on day 85 compared with day 1.Analyses of subjective assessments (secondary endpoints) The analyses of the questionnaire concerning the cos- metic effectiveness of the products revealed a clear overallpreference of the test product.
The superiority of the test product compared with placebo becomes clearer through summation of the single scores(‘‘2’’ =I completely agree; ‘‘1’’ =I agree; ‘‘0’’ =neither.nor; ‘‘-1’’=I disagree; ‘‘ -2’’=I completely disagree). A higher sum score with a better evaluation for the test product wasfound (Fig.5) for all criteria, with the exception of one cri- terion (Q19) ‘‘external care products less often,’’ with no difference between test product and placebo.The differencesin favor of the test product are signiﬁcant for items regardingskin moisture, suppleness, and softness of skin after productintake.Trial participants noted a superior effect of the testproduct compared with placebo in all named areas of thebody.The best subjective ratings in favor of the test productwere found for the backside, legs, neck, and belly, with themost frequently named improvements being ‘‘less dry,’’‘‘fewer wrinkles,’’ ‘‘more even,’’ and ‘‘more supple.’’ FIG.3.

This was achieved by ran-domization and triple-blinding, through which the treatmentmodality was unknown to (1) the trial participant, (2) thepersons who administered the products, and (3) the personwho assessed the outcomes. The expert grader of the con- focal laser scanning microscopy images was also blinded regarding the time when the image was taken (pre/posttreatment).Ingestion of collagen peptides can increase collagen synthesis but differ signiﬁcantly with regard to molecularsize and amino acid composition.5–7,9–11The speciﬁc bovine collagen peptides of the [HC]-collagen-complex are char-acterized by a high homogeneity of the amino acid proﬁlewith the human collagen protein.Previous peptide massﬁngerprinting and liquid chromatography-based proteomicmethods have demonstrated a high level of sequence iden- tity of bovine and porcine collagen with human skin colla- gen.
12Small cryptic peptides called cryptides together with speciﬁc cyclopeptides and matrikines generated from col-lagen biodegradation and bioresorption can enhance colla-gen synthesis in humans and can be successfully used toimprove, sustain, and maintain skin regeneration, renewal,and repair throughout the entire body. 5,13 A high bioavailability as assured by the speciﬁc digestion of the oligopeptides to the even shorter bioactive di- andtripeptides formed in the gastrointestinal tract supplies theskin with the speciﬁc collagen I and III protein amino acid pattern needed to sustain a sufﬁcient synthesis of the deci- sive component of the skin biomatrix.5–7,10–12The collagen structure also requires speciﬁc cofactors such as vitamin Cthat are needed for the formation of collagen as well asantioxidants that protect the protein from oxidation.
14,15 Since aging, stress, and pollution reduce collagen synthesisand thereby negatively impact skin appearance, sufﬁcientnutritional support is a decisive factor. 1,5,6The results of this interventional trial demonstrate the measurable cosmeticeffectiveness of the test product in improving skin quality.The ﬁndings are in line with those of previously published studies investigating the effects of oral collagen supple- mentation on the dermal collagen network.5–7The measured positive changes in the structure of connective tissue areclearly associated with functional improvements as reﬂectedby the clear and convincing effects noted in the subjectiveratings of the study participants.This randomized, placebo-contr olled, triple-blind trial con- ﬁrmed the positive cosmetic effe cts of the collagen-containing food supplement on the quality and appearance of the skin.AUTHOR DISCLOSURE STATEMENT No competing ﬁnancial interests exist.
