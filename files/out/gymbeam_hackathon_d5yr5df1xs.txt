Exploring Barriers to Vitamin A Supplementation Uptake and Program Implementation Among Children Aged 6–59Months in Ethiopia: A Qualitative Approach Getahun Fentaw Mulaw*, Seteamlak Adane Masresha and Fentaw Wassie Feleke Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Woldia University, Woldia, Ethiopia Background: Children in Ethiopia do not receive the recommended dose of vitamin A supplementation (VAS).Objective: This study aimed to explore the barriers to VAS uptake and program implementation among children aged 6 –59 months in Ethiopia.Methods: Data were collected qualitatively using focus group discussions and in-depth interviews.The data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and inductively coded.The resultswere displayed using thematic analysis and the well-spoken verbatim of the respondents.
Results: The barriers to VAS uptake were low parental awareness of the program and low interest or motivation, low promotion of the program among health professionals, anexcessive workload for health extension workers, and low professional attention to VAScompared to other health services. Conclusion: Both client-side and supply-side issues posed signi ﬁcant obstacles to the uptake of VAS.It is important to educate mothers about VAS.Health workers shouldreceive refresher training to raise their level of concern about VAS ’s importance and its schedule.It ’s crucial to initiate outreach programs for remote communities.The departmentalization of health extension packages will improve service and access.Keywords: children, vitamin A supplementation, qualitative approach, Amhara, Ethiopia INTRODUCTION Around two billion people globally suffer from micronutrient malnutrition [ 1].
The prevalence of vitamin A de ﬁciency (VAD) among children aged 6 –59 months was one-third worldwide in 2013, with sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) having one of the highest rates (48%) of VAD [ 2]. In 44 of the 49 SSA nations, VAD has a signi ﬁcant impact on public health [ 3].Furthermore, VAD is responsible for about 2% of all pediatric fatalities under the age of ﬁve [4].It primarily impacts 130 million preschoolers in developing nations [ 3] and raises their mortality risk by 20% –30% [ 5].
Children with VAD have a depressed immune system, which makes them more susceptible to infections andincreases their risk of developing common childhood illnesses like respiratory illnesses, diarrhea,measles, and eye issues [ 4,6–8].Edited by: Gabriel Gulis, University of Southern Denmark, Denmark Reviewed by: Anselimo Makokha, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya Gudina Terefe Tucho, Jimma University, Ethiopia *Correspondence: Getahun Fentaw Mulaw gechfentaw1014@gmail.com This Original Article is part of the IJPH Special Issue “Public Health and Primary Care, is 1 + 1 = 1? ” Received: 05 May 2023 Accepted: 15 September 2023 Published: 29 September 2023 Citation: Mulaw GF, Masresha SA and Feleke FW (2023) Exploring Barriers to Vitamin A Supplementation Uptake and Program Implementation Among Children Aged 6 –59 Months in Ethiopia: A Qualitative Approach.Int J Public Health 68:1606167.
doi: 10.3389/ijph.2023.1606167 Int J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers September 2023 | Volume 68 | Article 1606167 1International Journal of Public Health ORIGINAL ARTICLE published: 29 September 2023 doi: 10.3389/ijph.2023.1606167 VAD causes Xerophthalmia, a variety of eye conditions ranging from night blindness to more severe clinical outcomeslike keratomalacia and corneal scars and permanent blindness[9]. There are approximately 5 million preschool-aged cases of xerophthalmia, 10% of which have the potential to cause blindness [ 10].In Ethiopia, the prevalence rates of Bitot ’s spots and night blindness among children are 1.7% and 0.8%,respectively, and the prevalence of subclinical de ﬁciency is 37.7%.Thirty-two percent of child deaths in Ethiopia are attributable toVAD [ 11,12].Improving the vitamin A status of children will play a critical role in reducing child mortality [ 13,14].
To increase child survival, it is necessary to guarantee universal VAScoverage (100%) or at the very least ef ﬁcient coverage (80%) [15]. In 2016, only 64% of children in need in priority countries were reached with two doses of VAS but more than 140 million children were left behind, leaving themvulnerable to disease and death.In SSA, which has thehighest infant mortality rate in the world (78 deaths per1,000 live births), VAS coverage is declining.In 2016, only10 SSA ’s had effective coverage [ 15].Currently, VAS is administered routinely in Ethiopia as part of the Health extension program (HEP) to raise and maintain VAScoverage among under- ﬁve children above 80% [ 16–20].Even though numerous initiatives to expand VAS coverage have beenlaunched, their execution still falls short of expectations.According to the Ethiopian Demographic health survey (EDHS) 2019, the national VAS coverage among children aged6–59 months was 47.1%.In Amhara region it is 58.4% [ 21].
Additionally, speci ﬁc area studies conducted across Ethiopia have revealed that children aged 6 –59 months have a low VAS coverage rate. For instance, a study done in Libo kemkem andFogera district, Amhara region showed that only 29.3% ofchildren received VAS [ 22].Therefore, this study was aimed at exploring the barriers to VAS uptake and programme implementation among childrenaged 6 –59 months in Ethiopia.This would be bene ﬁcial for developing new VAS coverage strategies and reviewing existing ones for health policy makers, programme administrators, serviceproviders, and other stakeholder groups.METHODS Study Design, Area, and Period A qualitative explanatory research design was conducted in the North-Wello zone from 1 March 2021 to 15 March 2021.TheNorth-Wello zone is found 520 km northeast of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, and 360 km north of Bahir Dar, the capital city of the Amhara region.North-Wello is one of thezones of the Amhara Region, having 11 districts.
According tothe projection of the 2007 Ethiopian Census, the totalpopulation of the zone is estimated to be 1,788,901, of whichchildren under the age of ﬁve constitute 241,502. Within the zone, there are ﬁve general hospitals, 65 health centers, and 306 functional health posts.The people of the district are mainlyan agrarian community .Study participants The study participants were mothers who had given birth to at least one child within the previous 5 years, women ’s development armies, health professionals, health centres, and woreda health ofﬁce heads.Sample Size and Sampling Technique The sampling adequacy was determined by the point of idea saturation, despite the fact that there is no established andunanimous way of determining sample size for qualitativestudies [ 23,24].
Participants were selected using purposeful sampling, which took into consideration a range ofsociodemographic factors (such as age, education, place ofresidence, and religion), a range of health workers working atvarious levels, and a range of educational backgrounds. Participants for the Focus Group discussion (FGD) and in- depth interview were selected from four districts with theassistance of local coordinators.A total of four focus-groupdiscussions, comprising a total of 38 participants(8–12 members in each group), and 12 in-depth interviews were conducted at the Woreda and Kebele labels.Data Collection Procedures and Data Quality Control The data were collected through FGDs and in-depth interviews.Two unstructured interview guides for in-depth interviews (one customized to each subgroup of participants) and one unstructured interview guide for focus group discussions werecreated and translated into the local language, Amharic.
Theinterview guides shared a base of common questions andincluded additional questions based on the participant ’s status. Each interviewer followed an open-ended guide to assess the levelof knowledge and awareness about VAS, the barriers to itsimplementation, and which scheme (routine delivery orEnhanced outreach strategy) is important to increase coverage.Each in-depth interview took 30 –60 min, and each FGDs took 60–90 min.The data were collected by the research teams with the support of local coordinators.All interviews and focus groups were audio recorded, aided by key-note keeping.The location or spot for FGD and in-depth interviews was chosen while taking care to ensure participant comfort,convenience, and minimal destruction.A double audiorecording was made, and careful handling was used whentaking some critical notes.Data Management, Processing, and Analysis The tape-recorded data were transcribed verbatim and translated into English.
Then the interviewer ’s extensive notes were reviewed. First, each FGD and in-depth interview werethoroughly read and re-read to develop a coding scheme.Then, initial line-by-line coding was done to identify relevantthemes.In the next step, selective coding was performed, andrelevant codes were further categorized to form themes.Finally,the data was analyzed inductively using thematic analysis.Int J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers September 2023 | Volume 68 | Article 1606167 2Mulaw et al.Barriers to Vitamin A Supplementation Uptake Verbatim quotations were frequently used to illustrate the responses of the respondents to important issues and subthemes.Ethical Consideration The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Woldia University, College of Health Sciences (ERC0045/2021).An of ﬁcial letter of support was written to the North-Wello Health Bureau and respectiveworedas health of ﬁces to seek their essential cooperation.
Before starting the data collection process, the objective,purpose, possible procedures, potential risks and bene ﬁts of the study, and the possibility of withdrawing from the FGDsand interview were explained to participants to obtain informedverbal consent. The participants were assured of the con ﬁdentiality of the data.No personally identi ﬁable information was collected on the data collection tools, and instead of using names, codes were given to call the participants during the interviews and FGDs.Any identi ﬁers included in audio recordings were removed during transcription.All audio recordings were permanently deletedafter full transcription.Finally, after each interview and FGD,the data collectors and research teams communicated theimportance and schedule of VAS and other speci ﬁc interventions (deworming and dietary feeding practice) basedon the responses of mothers.
RESULTS Socio-Demographic Characteristics of Participants A total of 38 mothers participated in four focus group discussions of whom 13 are in the age range of 18 –25 years and 12 are in the age range of 26 –35 years. More than half [ 18] of the mothers were from rural communities ( Table 1 ).Participants in the in-depth interviews, comprising of women ’s development army members, health extensionworkers, health professionals working in health centers, nutrition focal persons, health center heads, district healthofﬁce heads, and mothers, were conducted ( Table 2 ).Barriers to Uptake of VAS and Program Implementation During interview and FGD ’s a number of barriers for VAS uptake and program implementation were identi ﬁed.These barriers were inductively coded in to into two broad themes andfurther ﬁve categories.The two broad themes are client level barriers and service provider level barriers ( Figure 1 ).
Some of the example(s) that best explain the category were selected fromrespondents ’well-spoken verbatim during FGD and key informant interviews. These quotes are presented in italics and between quotation marks.Low Knowledge and Awareness of the Importance of VAS and Its Schedule AmongParents The data indicated that most parents did not know about the importance of VAS, the consequences of vitamin A de ﬁciency, or the schedule of VAS.Though some mothers have heard aboutVAS, they don ’t know the de ﬁnite schedule of VAS.A 22 year-old urban resident mother replied to the question, “Do you know the importance of VAS and when the child should take it?” “...Leave the importance and the schedule, totally.I did not hear of the existence of such a service (to mean aVAS program) for children.Always when I go to ahealth center or health post, I get counseling on thechild immunization schedule but not on the VAS.
” A 29 year-old mother also stated that “...Since we do have access to vegetables and fruits, I believe that my child could get Vitamin A from those fooditems. Rather, I give attention to my child not to miss thevaccination schedule.” A 33 year-old woman in the development army also argued that “...As a woman in the development army, I should have to know about all the services delivered by healthposts.But until today, I didn ’t have the information.Most mothers have not enough knowledge on the importance and schedule of VAS.” Parental and Health Professionals ’Low Attention and Motivation The data also showed that mothers and health extension workers place less emphasis on VAS, especially for older children abovethe age of two.They only concentrate on the vaccinationTABLE 1 | Socio-demographic characteristics of focus group discussion participants, to assess the barriers for vitamin A supplementation uptakeamong children aged 6 –59 months in the North-Wello Zone, Ethiopia, 2021.

Barriers to Vitamin A Supplementation Uptake schedule, and mothers are also inclined to get Plumy-Net for their children.Another 37 year-old woman also replied as “...Most of the time we went to health posts eagerly to receive Plumpy-Nut; even though the health extensionworkers gave us information on other health services,our attention was on getting the Plumpy-Nut.We donot give equal weight to other services, evenimmunization.” A 28 year-old health extension worker said that “...There is low motivation among mothers on VAS.
Mothers did not bring their children every six monthsto health posts or health centers; more of those whotraveled long distances did so. For those living far awayfrom health posts, the regular house-to-house deliverywas better to reach them.” A 32 year-old mother also commented that“....I know about when it is taken, but I did not give emphasis on it and did not believe it could protectagainst diseases.Rather, I believe in the importance ofchild vaccination.” A 38 year-old degree holder and head of the health department summed up the barriers for VAS uptake as follows: “...Even though the accessibility is good, all children did not receive it because of various conditions.There is low motivation by mothers and even health extension providers, and the health extension workers bythemselves do not believe its importance is equal tothat of the vaccination schedule.
” A 31 year-old public health of ﬁcer professional working in the under- ﬁve OPD argued that “...Currently, most health professionals do not give emphasis to VAS. Even my children, aged 18 months,did not take VAS.We, as health professionals, did notTABLE 2 | Socio-demographic characteristics of in-depth interview participants to assess the barriers for vitamin A supplementation uptake among children aged 6–59 months in the North-Wello Zone, Ethiopia, 2021.

Barriers to Vitamin A Supplementation Uptake give attention to VAS during our counseling session.I think refreshment trainings and refocusing on VASprograms to reach the most vulnerable are needed.” A 37 year-old degree-holder health center head and a 24 year- old health extension worker, both argued that “...The former door-to-door campaign was better at reaching children than the current routine deliverymode.Because the campaigns were easy to mobilizethe community and raise mass awareness during eachcampaign session.It also will increase coverage ofolder children, because during routine follow-up,mothers only bring their younger children to thehealth posts; they do not consider it vital for the older ones, too.
” Low Promotion of the Scheme by Health Professionals Some parents argued that there is no or little promotion of the scheme by health professionals, unlike that of vaccination,institutional delivery, and the feeding practice of sick children.Even the health professionals themselves believe that there is littlepromotion of the severity of micronutrient de ﬁciencies and prevention mechanisms like VAS intake. A 27 year-old rural resident ’s mother stated that “...Most of the time, the health extension workers advise us on vaccination and child feeding practices,but not on VAS and its importance.” Another 32 year-old mother also commented that “...Most of the time I have contact with the health extension workers, but they never told me the severity ofvitamin A de ﬁciency and its protective mechanisms.I don ’t know the importance of VAS or when it is taken.
” A 30 year-old nutrition focal person also noted that “...The promotion and counseling service for VAS is very low among all health professionals. They did notgive equal emphasis to things like vaccination, ANC,and child feeding practices.” A 31 year-old urban resident housewife also made this note in a commanding way.“...Most of the time they (the health extension workers) did not give us information on the serviceswe get; they simply appoint us and bring our children,and we receive any service without having adequateinformation on it.For example, I don ’t know about the beneﬁts of VAS or its schedule.So, the way the service is delivered should be accompanied by adequateinformation for each service.”Workload Among Health Extension Workers Interviews with the Woreda health of ﬁce head, the health center head, and the health extension professionals showed that the healthextension packages are very vast, which leads to overburden among health extension workers.
This consequently led to lower service delivery for the needy community. A 28 year-old health extension worker commented that “...We are allowed to work on a lot of activities at a time and to report them timely.Because of this, personally, Iplace an emphasis on vaccination and Plumy-Nutdistribution for moderately and severely malnourishedchildren.To increase the quality and coverage of deliveryof all health packages, it is good to classify the packages atleast into two or three departments and employ a health extension worker per department.” A 41 year-old child health and nutrition of ﬁcer also supported that.“...The health extension packages are very vast.And they are loaded with routine activities such asvaccination of children, follow-up of malnourishedchildren, family planning, growth monitoring, andcommunicable disease prevention and control.Because of this, they may not deliver VAS strictly following the schedule.
The catchment area for some health posts is also very wide compared to the numberof deployed health extension workers. ” DISCUSSION According to this research, a lac k of information and awareness among parents about the importance of VAS and its schedule is a barrier to VAS uptake among children.Studies conducted in southern Ethiopia [ 16,25], Kenya [ 17], and Ghana [ 18] support thisﬁnding.Other studies have found that media exposure [ 19,20] and ownership of a radio or television [ 26] have a positive impact on VAS coverage, implying that they will raise population awareness.Astudy conducted in the Am hara region of Ethiopia ’sw e s tG o j j a m z o n ef o u n dt h a tm o t h e r sw h ob e l i e v e dt h e yu n d e r s t o o dt h eH E P swere more likely to visit the heal th post and obtain the program packages [ 27].If mothers are unaware of the signi ﬁcance of VAS and the current timetable, they are less likely to bring their childrento receive the service [ 28].
Maternal health awar eness is a key factor in encouraging the adoption of he alth-supportive behaviors and understanding the signi ﬁcant health effects of VAS [ 29]. This qualitative ﬁn d i n ga l s os h o w e dt h a t ,i nc o n t r a s tt o vaccinations and other curative services, parents assign lowpriority to VAS and its schedule despite knowing how importantit is.Thus, developing national and local communication strategieswill boost mothers ’desire for these essential services for children ’s health [ 30].Implementing alternative VAS delivery strategies, such as community health days, mass campaigns, and offering healtheducation, will boost community coverage and motivation inaddition to the regular service delivery [ 31].Int J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers September 2023 | Volume 68 | Article 1606167 5Mulaw et al.
Barriers to Vitamin A Supplementation Uptake Low promotion of the VAS scheme and the lack of attention provided to the VAS scheme by health professionals were foundto be contributors to low VAS coverage. Instead of focusing onpreventive services, health workers typically focus on curative services and addressing current health complaints.This might be the primary factor in the lack of attention aimed at raisingawareness of those preventive services [ 32].The other explanation might be that some health extension workersweren ’t adequately trained for all tasks during pre-service education [ 33].Workload and burnout, decreased community acceptance of health services, slow career advancement, a lack of atransfer policy, and insuf ﬁcient ﬁnancial rewards were some of the factors that demotivated health extension workers (HEWs),which ultimately compromised service delivery [ 34–36].
One of the reasons for the low coverage of VAS is also the workload of health extension wor kers, who must handle numerous healthcare packages at once. The Health Extension Program was launched at scale in 2003 with 17 packages under four areas, namely[1]: family health services (maternal and child health, family planning, immunization, adolescent reproductive health, nutrition) [2]; disease prevention and cont rol (HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, ﬁrst aid) [3]; hygiene and environmental san itation (proper and safe excreta disposal, proper and safe solid and liquid waste management, watersupply safety measures, food hygie ne and safety measures, a healthy home environment, arthropods and rodent control, personalhygiene); and [ 4] health education and communication [ 37,38].Most of the time, there are not eno ugh health extension workers assigned to provide those services, and they lack the time to visit everyhousehold to promote health and p rovide quality care services [ 36].
Due to their workload, they might prioritize providing curativeservices like distributing Plum py Nuts and treating infectious diseases like malaria and diarrh ea, and they also intend to leave their jobs [ 35]. A study done in the Amhara region of Ethiopia indicated that mothers who had frequent household visits by theHEWs were more likely to visit health posts [ 20].Even though women ’s development armies are assigned to each Keeble ’st o support health extension workers in delivering some of the services and promoting the commu nity for service utilization, they are not adequately trained and strengthened [ 39].Although not supported in this research, a qualitative ﬁnding from a study conducted in Nigeria revealed that the father ’s disapproval, unspeci ﬁed reasons, and peer advice were the barriers to low coverage of VAS [ 40].
Another research conﬁrmed that one of the factors in ﬂuencing children ’s uptake of VAS is the educational level of their parents [ 20].Strengths and Limitations In order to uncover deeper insights, the research used qualitative designs to examine VAS from the perspectives of parents andhealth professionals. The subjects ’varied socio-demographic backgrounds allowed for the exploration of a range of opinions and viewpoints.As a drawback, social-desirabilitybias may be observed in the interviewees ’answers.Conclusion and Recommendations The major barriers to the uptake of VAS were both client- and supply-side.Awareness about the importance of VAS and itsschedule should be promoted among mothers.Health workersshould receive refresher training in order to raise their level ofconcern regarding the signi ﬁcance of the VAS and its schedule.Additionally, expanding the number of facilities or concentrating outreach efforts in farther- ﬂung areas may increase children ’su s e of VAS.
In order to improve service quality and scope, it is alsoessential to develop strategies that focus on the work environment,increasing the number of health extension workers per cluster anddividing the 17 health extension packages into departments.
