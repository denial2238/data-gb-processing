For the ﬁrst experiment, 27 adult mice Balb / c (18 females, 9 males) were divided into 3 in each group, one male and two females, group one had the usual tap water as power, group two had 5% (w / v) GA and groupthree had 5% (w / v) of TT for 21 days.
The results showed, the number of offspring was more with GAtreated when compared to TT treated. Blood measurements of testosterone showed signiﬁcant increase in the GA group as compared to other groups, also Histopathological analysis showed the dose dependent 5% GA had normal seminiferous tubules with increase spermatogenesis.In this study the enhanced fer-tility in GA-treated mice Balb/c was observed and the experimental studies also show that GA fertility was increased./C2112020 Published by Elsevier B.V.on behalf of King Saud University.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).1.Introduction Infertility is a major issue that complicates reproductive age couples, leading to further psychological complications.
Numerous factors causing male infertility; Decreased semen production in the population over time eliminated from different sectors and farm systems environmental harmful chemicals ( Geoffroy-Siraudin, C., et al., 2012 ). The bioaccumulation of the toxic chemicals in the food chain causes the death of the organisms to inﬂuence the growth, development and reproduction of the organisms directlyand indirectly ( Mikulewicz, M., et al., 2014 ), thus leading to various alterations at reproductive stages like spermatogenesis ( Easley, IV., et al., 2015 ).Pretesticular, testicular, post-testicular, sperm abnor- mality is the cause of male infertility, which investigates cell phase and shows the development of reactive oxygen (ROS) species which causes cellular and oxidative damage in many tissues (Dimitriadis, F.et al., 2017 ).Recently, antioxidants are of major concern to break the oxida- tive chain reaction ( Kurutas, E.
B., 2015 ), hence herbal medicines are preferred choice for treating male infertility. The presence of natural antioxidant in plants treating various diseases, suggested the treatment of male infertility with no side effects (Safarnavadeh, T., & Rastegarpanah, M.2011 ).Whereas sildenaﬁl citrate the ﬁrst oral drug approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction has a high risk of cardiovascular problematic events, particularly fatal arrhythmias, headache, blurred vision, back pain, muscle pain, nausea.Ethno-botanical survey has revealed herbal medicines may be preferred in treating male infertility, the antioxidants present https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsps.2020.11.005 1319-0164/ /C2112020 Published by Elsevier B.V.on behalf of King Saud University.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).⇑Corresponding author at: Prof.

Phytochemicals like alkaloids treats infertility (Tahvilzadeh, M., et al., 2016 ) saponins are known to improve human sperm parameters ( Khaleghi, S., et al., 2017 ) ﬂavonoids improve male sperm quality as it neutralizes the adverse effects of metals on semen quality ( Jamalan, M., et al., 2016 ), terpenoids improve seminal oxidative stress ( Adewoyin, M., et al., 2017 ) tan- nins enhancing male infertility ( Mohammadi, F., et al., 2013 ) the antioxidant present in the phytochemicals has potential to provide help in protecting cellular damage of erectile tissues ( Naik, B. S., et al., 2016 ).Gum arabic ( Acacia senegal ) is a member of the Leguminosae family, most of them found in Sudan.Gum arabic possesses a lot of counseling ( Ahmed, A.A.2018 ).The established antioxidant properties of GA are high ( Mariod, A.A.2018 ).Based on the above observation of GA possessing many antiox- idants with radical scavenging properties, in comparison with Tribulus terrestris Linn .
(zygophyllaceae) a well-known Chinese medicine to improve sexual functions ( Zhu, W., et al., 2017 ). Pre- sent investigation was initiated to treat male infertility.Hence a couple of experiments were conducted to distinguish the efﬁciency of GA treatment on fertility.Expt.1; physiological parameters, histopathology, testosterone analysis in mice.Expt.2; deals with semen analysis (seminogram).2.Material and methods 2.1.Gum arabic (Acacia senegal) The Acacia senegal powder was purchased from the local market of Sudan, it is 100% natural powder from Acacia senegal trees which has been prepared by mechanical grinding to ﬁne particle with size <210 lm without any additive.
The quality conﬁrmed to be used in food and pharmaceutical requirements approved from The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), https://www.fda.gov/food/food- additives-petitions/food-additive-status-list and recognized as safest dietary ﬁber by Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations (FAO), British pharmacopoeia (BP), United State the Foodarmacopoeia (USP) and Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). In Europe countries Acacia gum (E 414) is authorized as a food additive in the European Union (EU) in accordance with Annex II and Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 on food additives, https://efsa .onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903 / j.efsa.2017.47412.2.Tribulus terrestis Tribulus terrestris (TT) were collected from the outside garden of Turabah City Saudi Arabia and identiﬁed by specialist in plant.
The collected spines of TT were cleaned, later the ﬁne powder was pre- pared with electrical grinder, dissolved in water TT (5% w/v): dis- solve 5 g in 100 ml distilled water, boiled at 60◦C for 5 min, cooled, ﬁltered and given daily to mice for 21 days. 2.3.Animal studies The animal experiments were carried out on Balb/c mice both sexes, from King Fahd Research Center, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.All mice of either sex (female, n = 18, male, n = 9) were housed under controlled environmental conditions (22–24 /C176C, 50–70% humidity and a 12-h light/dark cycle).Mice were divided into three groups in every group two female were put in separate cages with one male for mating.One group were given normal tap water, group two had a Acacia senegal powder 5%(w/v) dissolved in tap water (5 g/100 ml), ( Nasir O., et al., 2008 ), group three had aqueous extract of Tribulus terrestis spines 5%(w/v), ( Saiyeda A., et al., 2016 ).
For the whole period of study the drink of GA and TT were refreshed every 3 days. Throughout the study, mice had free accessto standard pelleted food containing (C1310, Altromin, Lage, Ger- many).All animal experiments were conducted in accord with the principles for the care and use of laboratory animals in research and approved by the local ethics committee of our University, All mice were weighted daily to monitor the increase in body weight, after delivery the offspring were counted and weighed daily for two weeks to all groups.
On the last day of the experiment all 9 males from all groups were lightly anesthetized with diethy- lether (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and blood was withdrawn into blood collecting tube by puncturing the retro -orbital plexus for testosterone measurements by immunoassay (CMIA) for the quan- titative determination of testosterone from ARCHITECT, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL USA, At the end of the experiment, all 9 males were sacriﬁced by cer- vical dislocation and the scrotal sacs opened. The whole testis was removed and ﬁxed in ﬁve times its volume of 10% formal saline, the testes were put in separate containers and labelled.After complete ﬁxation of the testes, blocks were embedded in parafﬁn wax and 5mm thick sections were cut, the tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, mounted in Canada balsam and micro- scopic examination of the sections was then carried out under the light microscopic (Nikon, Eclipse i80) and the required images Fig.1.a.

Current GA treatment was compared to treatment with Tribulus terristis ; considered to be an aphrodisiac used in tradi- tional Chinese medicine to improve sexual function ( Neychev, V. K., & Mitev, V.I., 2005 ).GA has shown many phytochemicals thus increased levels of antioxidants, which reduces the oxidative stress(Ahmed, A.A., et al., 2016 ).Moreover, prior studies showed the progression of male infertility depends on oxidative stress (Agarwal, A., et al., 2014 ).GA has phytochemicals like ﬂavonoids ( Al Alawi, et al., 2018 ), alkaloids ( ALI, K.S.E., et al., 2020 ), tannins ( Okoro, S.O., et al., 2012 ) terpenoids ( Al Alawi, S.M., et al., 2018 ), and saponins (Suleiman, I.Y., et al., 2017 ).Phytochemicals such as saponins and ﬂavonoids has improved fertility ( Naik, B.
S., et al., 2016 ), stress leading to ROS causes erectile dysfunction, damages Leydig cells, which decrease the testosterone and also loss of libido is observed, antioxidant potential helps provide protection against cellular damage to erectile tissues ( Zhang, Q., et al., 2011 ). Sapo- nins are considered as anti-stress modulators, they resist the body from stress ( Lee, S.H., et al., 2006 ), both saponins and ﬂavonoids are known for penile erection ( Kotta, S., et al., 2013 ).Testosterone a steroid hormone derived from cholesterol under the inﬂuence of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone synthesized in the testes’ Leydig cells, which plays a major role in the erectile function caused by ROS stress ( Sheweita, S., et al., 2015 ).Fig.6.Shows the testis section, A and B as Control group showing seminiferous tubules (T) lined by stratiﬁed germinal epithelium (Ge), interstitial spaces (I).

C and D showing treated 5% GA ha s seminiferous tubules (T) lined by stratiﬁed germinal epithelium (Ge), interstitial spaces (I) have lumina with a few spermatocytes after treatment of (5%) Gum ara bic and E and F showing some lumina wide with few sperm after the treatment of (5%) Tribulus terrestis (TT).Fig.5.The male testosterone concentration level for all groups; control, Gum arabic and Tribulus terrestis after 21 days of treatment.O.Nasir, N.Alqadri, S.Elsayed et al.Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal 28 (2020) 1791–1796 1794 GA is considered to have phytochemicals of antioxidant activity that have aphrodisiac and fertility effects that help human and ani- mal experiment performance.
In this study, there was a substantial increase in body weight from baseline in all 3 classes, an increase in body weight was comparable in control and 5% GA was treated, a decrease in weight in 5% of tribulus-treated terrorists. Increase testosterone levels in animals and humans treated with GA, boost seminogram, increase spermatogenesis ( Fedail, J.S., et al., 2016 ).Effect of Increase in the number of offspring with good body weight, conﬁrms that GA can increase libido and sexual function, which lead to improved potency and erectile function, and should be used to treat male infertility.The mechanism of GA on the reproductive system is not completely understood, but the mech- anism is to be related to previous study, antioxidant features, phy- tochemicals present in this plant conﬁrm their infertility treatmentwith our ﬁndings, show that the ability of GA to boost testosterone, boost semen analysis, improve sperm count, increase semen vol- ume and inc.
Experimental studies through the extracts of T. terrestris have indicated an improvement in rat’s sexual function owing to an increase in testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and dehy- droepiandrosterone ( Singh et al., 2012 ).5.Conclusion Based on the ﬁndings, it is considered that Gum arabic ( Acacia senegal ) has a beneﬁcial effect on the treatment of male infertility.As GA is often used as a curative agent in many diseases, GA with phytochemicals has shown a rise in antioxidants, thereby minimiz- ing oxidative stress, and increased sexual activity is attributable to phytomedicines present in GA.This result is useful in improvingsexual dysfunction, GA has shown all potential male infertility with our ﬁndings in animal studies.CRediT authorship contribution statement Omaima Nasir: Conceptualization, Data curation, Writing - original draft.Nada Alqadri: Conceptualization, Writing - original draft.Salma Elsayed: Conceptualization, Formal analysis.
