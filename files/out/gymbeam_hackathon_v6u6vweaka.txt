REVIEW Hospitalized patients with cirrhosis: Addressing gaps in care Jennifer Batisti1|Sofia S.Jakab2 1Section of Digestive Diseases, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA 2Section of Digestive Diseases, Yale University School of Medicine, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, New Haven, Connecticut, USA Correspondence Sofia S.Jakab, Section of Digestive Diseases, Yale School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, LMP 1080, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.Email: simona.jakab@yale.edu In the last 3 years, all major hepatology and gastroenterol- ogy societies (American A ssociation for the Study of Liver Diseases —AASLD, American Gastroenterological Association —AGA, American College of Gastroenterology —ACG, European Association for the Study of the Liver — EASL) have published detailed guidance regarding themanagement of patients with cirrhosis.
Those recommen-dations include evidence-based practices relevant forhospitalized patients, from treating several complicationsof cirrhosis such as ascites/spontaneous bacterialperitonitis, [1]acute kidney injury/hepatorenal syndrome,[2,3] variceal bleeding,[4,5]HE,[6]acute-on-chronic liver failure,[7,8] to integration of palliative care[9,10]and optimal management of malnutrition.[11]This shows the highly complex care required to appropriately take care of patients with cirrhosis.While therapeutic advances are certainly benefiting ourpatients, consistent guideline-driven clinical practiceremains challenging. In addition, transitions of care andappropriate transfer/referral for liver transplantation are critical for providing patient-centered quality hospital care.
We hope that the following considerations will help hospital-based practitioners with variable experience in hepatologyto address these gaps in the management of hospitalizedpatients with cirrhosis and deliv er high-value inpatient care. ALIGNING CLINICAL PRACTICE WITH GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS Successful implementation of practice guidelines is variable across hospital systems.[12,13 ]To promotevalue improvement in cirrhosis care by reliably measur- ing and tracking the health care provided, AASLD hasdeveloped a standardized set of quality measures, including process measures, clinical, and patient- reported outcomes.[14]Table 1 summarizes the AASLD quality measures applicable for the inpatientmanagement of cirrhosis and relevant major societyguidelines.Higher adherence to certain qualitymeasures was associated with lower overall mortalityand lower inpatient health care use, [15]but further research is needed to evaluate the full impact of process measures on clinical outcomes.
Given increased interest and publications on quality improvement (QI) in cirrhosis, there is now substantialdata assessing the efficacy of several initiatives to alignreal-world practice with guidelines-based management.Various QI interventions in cirrhosis targeted highercompliance to recommended process measures withthe goal of achieving superior clinical outcomes (survival, decreased rate of complications) and avoiding unwarranted hospital service utilization (preventableadmissions/readmissions, unjustified length of hospitalstay).
To overcome the knowledge gap due to timerestrains and difficulty for hospital practitioners to keepup to date with the latest guidelines, many QI trials haveused easy-to-access and time-efficient tools to reducevariation in clinical practice: handheld checklists, [16] templated notes,[17]best practice alerts/decision support,[16]and clinical pathways/order sets.[18,19 ]More resource-intensive solutions have addressed institu-tional logistics and culture changes but require highcommitment across all shareholders: “best practice ”in Abbreviations : AASLD, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases; ACG, American College of Gastroenterology; AGA, American Gastroenterological Association; EASL, European Association for the Study of the Liver; ER, emergency room; LT, liver transplant; QI, quality improvement.

Optimal QI in cirrhosis should integrate clinical practice with an iterative QI process,ideally based on a learning health system paradigm,continuously assessing the efficacy of interventions andresponding to clinical challenges. [25] NUTRITION MANAGEMENT FOR THE HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS There is a high prevalence of malnutrition among patients with cirrhosis, exceeding 90% in some studypopulations.[26]Both macronutrients and micronutrients/ trace elements may be deficient,[27–30]with important implications for the hospitalized patient.For patients with alcohol use disorders and cholestatic disorders, malnutrition may be present to a significant degree priorto the onset of cirrhosis and can worsen as the liverdisease progresses.[29,31 ]Imposed fasting states, such as preprocedure or pretesting “nil per os ”periods, exacerbate this caloric deficit, which may be particularlyrelevant in the inpatient setting.
Malnutrition in cirrhosisis associated with sarcopenia, infection, and frailty and thus contributes to an increased risk of mortality. [32–35] This risk extends to patients who receive a liver transplant (LT); malnutrition is a risk factor for poortransplant outcomes.[36] Despite the consequences of malnutrition, it tends to be under-assessed and under-diagnosed, even bysubspecialty providers.[26,37 ]However, addressing and treating malnutrition in patients with cirrhosis can both improve quality of life and extend survival.[38,39 ]There- fore, in the hospitalized patient with cirrhosis, nutritionalstatus should be assessed at admission and mayneed repeated assessment if a hospital stay isprolonged.[11,26,35 ]Ideally, this assessment should involve a multispecialty team with a gastroenterologist/hepatologist and a dietician.
[11,26,35 ]Choosing the correct screening tools can be challenging, as the majority of validated nutritional screening and assess- ment instruments are not specific for liver disease.Furthermore, their use in the inpatient setting can be limited by expense, the need for specialized equipment,and patient factors such as hypervolemia. [35,40 ]For example, the presence of ascites can mask abnormallylow body mass index.[41]True obesity, far from reassuring the clinician that malnutrition is not present,can also obfuscate the presence of sarcopenia as well as other nutrient deficiencies.[34,42 ]The Royal Free Hospital-Nutritional Prioritizing Tool can be used at thebedside by nonspecialist staff as a screening tool, [43] though further, more specific testing may later be needed.Several general nutritional principles can be applied in the inpatient setting.
In situations where patients withcirrhosis present with significant ascites and/or edema, a low salt diet, defined as ≤2000 mg/24 hours of dietary sodium, is recommended. [43]This should be differenti- ated from a “no salt added ”diet, which for US adults is typically 3400 mg/24 h of dietary sodium, most of whichcomes from processed foods.[44]Patients with cirrhosis typically have elevated protein needs, requiring1.2–1.5 g/kg/d of protein.[45]There is no role for protein restriction to prevent HE,[46]and there is insufficient evidence to recommend animal-based or plant-based protein sources specifically for the prevention of HE.[47] Oral nutritional supplementation may be beneficial in the hospital setting; although a recent meta-analysishas not supported an overall mortality benefit fromsupplementation use, subgroup analyses support itsuse in hospitalized patients.
[11,48 ]Given the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies within this population, some societies have suggested the use of an empiric multivitamin.[11]In addition to minimizing times of nil per os, small frequent meals and the implementation ofevening snacks are additional strategies [40,49,50 ]that can be employed to maximize nutrition in the inpatient withcirrhosis. Patient education regarding nutrition and dietary strategies remains crucial.Many patients with cirrhosis have a limited understanding of their disease state, including nutrition goals, [51]and an inpatient hospital stay provides a potential opportunity for patient andfamily education.TRANSITIONS OF CARE FOR THE HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS There is limited data on best practices for transitions of care for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis.Thisrepresents a significant information deficit, as patientswith cirrhosis have a high rate of hospitalization, whichhas been increasing within the United States.
[52]A timely transfer to a LT center is an important part of an optimal transition of care for patients who are critically ill and need to undergo their LT evaluation in anHOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS |3 © 2024 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.Unauthorized reproduction of this article proh ibited.“expedited ”fashion.Delayed referrals were associated with worse outcomes.[53,54 ]While discussions about LT are typically deferred to gastroenterology/hepatologyteam, hospital providers responsible for the inpatientcare of patients with cirrhosis should have a basicunderstanding of indications for LT and be comfortableto initiate the transfer to a transplant center for an expedited evaluation especially if their local access to inpatient specialty care is limited.
Barring a specificcontraindication to LT, patients hospitalized for compli-cations of cirrhosis, such as portal hypertensivebleeding, HE, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,or hepatorenal syndrome should be considered fortransplant evaluation. [55–57]Model for End-Stage Liver Disease –Sodium score ≥15 has also been used as a threshold for LT referral[56]; however, it is important to note that patients with cirrhosis may have a low Modelfor End-Stage Liver Disease –Sodium score and still demonstrate elements of decompensation; transplantreferral should not be withheld based on a low Model forEnd-Stage Liver Disease –Sodium score.Multiple barriers to initiation of LT referral and evaluation have been identified.
These include incorrect provider understanding of transplant contraindications, [53]patient socioeconomic status,[58] perceived complexity of referral process,[59]and geography.[60]Parameters for defining contraindica- tions to LT, especially psychosocial contraindications,have changed since the inception of transplant care.Severe acute alcoholic hepatitis, previously consid-ered a contraindication to LT, is now accepted as an indication for LT at an increasing number of centers within the United States [61]and should not preclude referral. While transplant centers within the UnitedStates are encouraged to develop program-specificcriteria for patient evaluation, a recent Organ Procure-ment and Transplantation Network white paper [62]has recommended that neither patient chronologic age norimmigration status should serve as the sole criteria for determining eligibility for transplant.
Finally, patient education and facilitation of post- hospital discharge follow-up remain critical points inthe transitional care of patients with cirrhosis fromhospital to home or from local hospital to transplantcenter. Patients and their caregivers have reportedsignificant educational deficiencies regarding theprocess of LT.[63]Lack of patient education from the multidisciplinary team has been identified as a risk factor for medication-related problems in patients withcirrhosis [64]and for poor medication adherence post- LT.[65]Multimodal education presentations (eg, both written and verbal) have been identified as helpful.[63] Provision of educational tools regarding cirrhosis in general has demonstrated utility,[66]though further studies on the type and timing of educational interventions are needed.
The increased use of telehealth platforms has also shown promise indecreasing hospital readmission for patients with cirrhosis and improving outcomes.[67,68 ] PALLIATIVE CARE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THEHOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS The lack of including palliative care in the 2019 AASLD quality measures in cirrhosis is rather proof of a rapidlygrowing field, as both AASLD and AGA publishedrecent guidance [9,10]regarding the importance of pri- mary and specialty palliative care in the management ofpatients with advanced liver disease. Both documents highlight the unmet demand for palliative care and include great resources that hospital providers can usein their practice, from introducing the benefits ofpalliative care to their patients to improving theirpalliative care skills specifically to address the needsof patients with cirrhosis.
There is reluctance to start palliative care discus- sions in the inpatient setting as likely there is no longitudinal relationship between patient and providers, but hospitalizations and transitions of care, especiallyescalation of care to medical intensive care unit, aresentinel events that should prompt goals of careconversations. [10]Hospitalized patients with cirrhosis must cope with unexpected deteriorations in theirdisease course, new or worsening cirrhosis complica-tions, frequent readmissions, invasive procedures, medication side effects, and they should be given the opportunity to reassess if the medical care they receiveremains concordant with their wishes.
All providers caring for patients with cirrhosis should feel comfortable applying primary palliative care princi-ples within their practice (assess/treat symptoms, fostercommunication around goals of care, and advance careplanning) and collaborate with gastroenterology/hepa- tology specialists regarding prognosis and LT candidacy. [10]As specialty palliative care is more available inpatient rather than outpatient in most healthcare systems, patients with complex needs (eg, difficultgoals of care discussions and family dynamics, man-agement of refractory symptoms) could access pallia-tive care consultation during hospitalization, but thisrequires active involvement of the hospital team to explore the need to involve palliative care consultants.In summary, the management of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis is increasingly complex.
High-value inpatient care requires adherence to best prac-tices, and integration of QI processes with clinical carekeeps us accountable to achieve and maintain a higherstandard of health care delivery.
