The effect of feeding adequate or de ﬁcient vitamin B 6or folic acid to breeders on methionine metabolism in 18-day-old chick embryos J.Lu, *J.T.Weil,yP.Maharjan,yM.K.Manangi,zS.Cerrate,xand C.N.Coony,1 *Analytics & Data Science, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC 27409, USA;yCenter of Excellence for Poultry Science, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, USA;zResearch and Development, Novus International, Inc., St.Charles, MO, 63304, USA; andxCredinser LLC, Madison, AL 35756, USA ABSTRACT Three isotopic tracers ([2,3,3-2H3]-L- serine, [2H11]-L-betaine, and [1-13C]-L-methionine) were administered by amnion injection into 18-day-old chickembryos to investigate the kinetics of methioninemetabolism.
The embryos utilized were from eggscollected from 34-week-old Cobb 500 broiler breedersthat were fed either a control diet containing folic acid (1.25 mg/kg diet) and pyridoxine HCl (5 mg/kg diet) or diets devoid of supplemental pyridoxine or folic acid.Intermediate metabolites of methionine metabolism andpolyamines were analyzed in 18-day-old chick embryos.There were no differences in hepatic [ 2H2] methionine or [2H3] cysteine enrichments or in physiological concen- trations of sulfur amino acids for chick embryos frombreeders fed the control diet and embryos from breeders fed diets containing no pyridoxine or folic acid.
Sup- plementation of B 6or folic acid did not affect the pro- duction of methionine and cysteine in chick embryos.However, breeders fed the control diet with both folicacid and pyridoxine supplementation produced em-bryos with a two-fold reduction of hepatic homocyste-ine and increased spermine compared with embryosfrom breeders fed diets containing no supplemental pyridoxine or folic acid ( P,0.05). Hepatic S-adeno- sylmethionine for embryos from breeders fed no sup-plemental B 6was half the concentration compared with embryos from breeders fed the control diet.Embryosfrom breeders fed the control diet were utilized todetermine the proportion of homocysteine going through remethylation and transsulfuration and also to determine the pathway of remethylation.Sixty- ﬁve percent of the methyl groups used for homocysteineremethylation from control embryos was via the MFMTpathway.
Alternatively, 61% of homocysteine fromcontrol embryos was remethylated via the MFMT andthe BHMT reactions and 39% of homocysteine wascatabolized to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway. These data show that in embryos, interme- diate metabolites of methionine and polyamines in-crease in concentration when pyridoxine levels areprovided in de ﬁcient concentrations to the breeder hen.In addition, this research demonstrates that folic aciddeﬁcient embryos conserve methionine, rather than catabolize it to cysteine.

Owing to its involvement in metabolic processes and oxidativestress, a nutritional imbalance of methionine can leadto a variety of metabolic problems.
For instance, priorstudies have suggested that altered methionine supplies impair normal methionine metabolism in laying hens and broilers and methionine metabolism plays an impor-tant role in chick embryo growth and development ( Cao et al., 1995 ;Lu et al., 2020a ,2020b ). In addition, Rosen- quist and Finnell reported that increased homocysteinelevels impaired chick embryonic development.In /C2112021 Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-NDlicense ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).Received September 1, 2020.Accepted December 24, 2020.1Corresponding author: ccoon@uark.edu 1 separate studies with chick embryos and broiler chicks hatched from breeders fed control nutrient and vitamin formulations, Lu et al.(2020a, 2020b) indicated lower levels of cystathionine ß-synthase activity may be limiting cysteine formation during embryogenesis andduring the early period of broiler grow-out.
High levelsof cystathionine found in the human fetus have beenshown to be related to a limitation of the transsulfura-tion pathway because the cystathionase (EC 4.4.1.1,C-ase) activity does not appear until after birth ( Gaull et al., 1972 ). Providing adequate methionine to broilers and breeders ensures a metabolic pathway of methioninemetabolism as shown in Figure 1 , unless nutritional di- versities arise ( Finkelstein, 1990 ).Vitamin B 6and folic acid are 2 key vitamins utilized as coenzymes in methionine metabolism.Pyridoxal phos-phate, an active form of B 6, plays a key role as coenzyme for serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( SHMT ), cysta- thionine ß-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22, CBS), and C-ase (Finkelstein, 2000 ).Vitamin B 6has been shown to alter homocysteine metabolism by decreasing SHMT activityand by suppressing homocysteine catabolism via thetranssulfuration pathway ( Selhub, 1999 ;Martinez et al., 2000 ).
Folic acid is involved through the 5- methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransfer-ase (EC.2.1.1.13, MFMT) reaction which is one of 2 remethylation pathways for converting homocysteine to methionine. Low levels of folate lead to a reductionin methylation, inhibiting the synthesis of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM )(Finkelstein, 1990 ; Stipanuk, 2004 ).Bottiglieri (1996) has reported that de- ﬁciencies of folate can decrease methylation of homocys- teine, leading to elevated homocysteine levels in bloodand urine.Stable isotope-labeled amino acids have been used to determine the kinetics of methionine, homocysteine,and cysteine in adult humans and rats ( Storch et al., 1988;Young et al., 1997 ;Gregory et al., 2000 ; Martinez et al., 2000 ;Cuskelly et al., 2001 ;MacCoss et al., 2001 ).The stable isotope of an amino acid is a naturally occurring form of an amino acid ( Sulzman, 2007).
Several forms of isotopes exist, differing in the amount of neutrons ( Ben-David and Flaherty, 2012 ). Positional variations in isotopes of atoms can exist andare known as isotopomers ( Ben-David and Flaherty, 2012).The use of stable isotopes as metabolic tracers provides an opportunity for in vivo assessment of meta- bolic changes occurring in physiological systems.Vacci-nations to chick embryos are often provided through inovo injections in the amniotic ﬂuid, considering its abil- ity to deliver a substrate ef ﬁciently ( Jochemsen and Jeurissen, 2002 ;Zhai et al., 2008 ;Keralapurath et al., 2010).This paper exploits the similar technique of vacci- nation to introduce isotopic molecules into the amniotic ﬂuid to study methionine metabolism in 18-day-old em- bryos.To the authors ’knowledge, the use of stable Figure 1.Methionine metabolism in mammals.

2 isotopes to study methionine kinetics for the purpose of evaluating the importance of folic acid and pyridoxine in chick embryos has not been reported at this time. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were 1)to investigate the effect of supplementing folic acid orpyridoxine in breeder diets on methionine metabolitesand understand methionine kinetics evaluating remethy-lation and transsulfuration of homocysteine in liver tis-sue of 18-day-old chick embryos; 2) to determine theproportion of homocysteine remethylated to methionine by hepatic 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.13, MFMT) comparedwith hepatic betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase(EC 2.1.1.5, BHMT) in 18-day-old chick embryos in folicacid and pyridoxine supplemented breeder diets.MATERIALS AND METHODS All procedures regarding the use of live animals in this study were conducted in accordance with the University of Arkansas Institutional Animal Care and Animal Use Protocol #03008.
Flock Management and Experimental Diets Fifty-four Cobb 500 females (34-week-old) with similar body weights were randomly selected from a ﬂock of Cobb broiler breeder hens ( ﬁrst egg, 180 d; peak egg production, 83%). The females were randomly assignedto 54 individual breeder cages and received one of thefollowing dietary treatments for a 12-week period beforeegg collection: control, control-de ﬁcient pyridoxine, or control-de ﬁcient folic acid ( Table 1 ).The breeder control diet ( Table 1 ) was formulated to meet Cobb 500 female nutrient requirements with supplemental folic acid(1.25 mg/kg diet) and pyridoxine HCl (5 mg/kg diet)(Cobb-Vantress, 2016 ).Requirements of folic acid and pyridoxine for broiler-breeders in production, as pub-lished by Cobb-Vantress, are 3 and 6 mg/kg, respec-tively ( Cobb-Vantress, 2018 ).Supplemental pyridoxine was omitted in the pyridoxine-de ﬁcient treatment.For the folic acid –deﬁcient treatment, supplemental folic acid was removed from the diet.
Amino acid analysesof the feed were conducted at the University of MissouriAgricultural Experiment Station Chemical Laboratoriesfollowing AOAC Of ﬁcial Method 982.30. To determine folic acid concentration in the diets, AOAC Of ﬁcial Methods 960.46 and 992.05 (2005) were followed.Inaddition, pyridoxine HCl was measured by a commercial laboratory using a modi ﬁcation of AOAC Of ﬁcial Method 961.15.Feed allocation was 144 g per bird dur-ing the ﬁrst week of the experiment.Feed was reduced 1 g per week until the hens were receiving 133 g duringthe last week of the experiment.The 144 g feed amountprovided 420 kcal of ME/hen/day, which is lower thanthe energy recommendations by Cobb-Vantress ( Cobb- Vantress, 2016 ).The amount of feed supplied to the hens was reduced because of the lower energy expendi- ture for hens housed individual cages, than for those inﬂoor pens.This knowledge is based on our previousﬁndings ( Reyes and Coon, 2003 ).
Twenty-nine Cobb males that were the same age as the hens were used to artiﬁcially inseminate each breeder, once each week, with approximately 50 million sperm by using the pro-cedure fully described by de Beer and Coon (2007) .I n short, this procedure involved massaging the saddle re-gion of the male, collecting the semen, pooling the semen,and measuring the sperm cell concentration using anIMV MicroReader I (IMV Technologies, Minneapolis,MN). During the last week of the experiment, hatching eggs were collected from the inseminated hens and set in incubators.Eggs were incubated 18 d in Jamesway in-cubators (Jamesway Incubator Company, Cambridge,Ontario, Canada) at the University of Arkansas PoultryResearch Farm before sampling.Incubation settings fol-lowed standard industry conditions in which the opti-mum temperature of the incubator was 100.5 degreesFahrenheit.Relative humidity inside the incubator ranged from 50 to 55%.
Isotopic Infusion Procedures Stable isotopes of L-serine (2,3,3-2H3, 98%; 15N 98%), L-betaine (2H11, 98%), and L-methionine (1-13C, 99%) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Tewksbury,MA) were administered as a single bolus dose by amnioninjection into the 18-day-old embryos from each treat-ment (control, basal-B6, and basal-folic acid). To admin-ister the isotope, the egg was ﬁrst removed from the incubator, candled for fertility, and weighed to deter- mine body weight.Doses were 380, 380, and 95 mmol/ kg of egg weight for [2H3] serine, [2H11] betaine, and[1-13C] methionine, respectively.The eggs were injectedin ovo with the appropriate treatment using a 2.54-cm21-gauge needle.To ensure that isotopic solution enteredthe amnion, the length of the needle was inserted entirelyinto egg.Six embryos per treatment were sampled at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after injection.Liver tissues were then separated from sampled embryos.
The 3 isotopictracers described above were also separately adminis-tered by amnion injection into 18-day-old chick embryosfrom broiler breeders fed control diets. Doses are 3,420,3,420, and 2,280 mmol/kg egg weight for L-serine (2, 3, 3-2H3, 98%; 15N 98%), L-betaine (2H11, 98%), and L-methionine (1-13C, 99%), respectively (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Tewksbury, MA).Four em- bryos were sampled at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 minafter injection to understand methionine formation viaremethylation and transsulfuration and relative contri-butions of BHMT and MFMT pathways.Liver tissuesfrom the 18-day-old embryos were collected.Immedi-ately after removal, the liver samples were frozen andstored at 279 /C14C until analysis.
Amino Acid Assay Hepatic free methionine, cysteine, cystathionine, serine, and glycine analysis was completed using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with AccQ-Tag derivati-zation and ﬂuorescence detection ( Cohen and Micheaud,METHIONINE METABOLISM IN CHICK EMBRYOS 3 1993). Hepatic free homocysteine was determined following the procedure described by Gilﬁx et al.(1997) with tissue sample preparation modi ﬁed by Uthus et al.(2002) .Hepatic SAM and S-adenosylhomocysteine levels were obtained by using the procedure described byWang et al.(2001) .Hepatic concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine were determined with the pro-cedure described by Merali and Clarkson (1996) .Determination of Isotopic Enrichments The isotopic enrichment of methionine and cysteine were determined by HPLC-MS using reverse-phase chro- matography and electro-spray ionization.
The benchtopmass spectrometer (MS) was a Waters Quadrapole LCZequipped with an electrospray ionization probe and interfaced with a Waters Alliance 2690 HPLC. The MS was operated in positive ion mode using the scan mode col-lecting mass data.Separation of the methionine iso-topomers was accomplished following the proceduredescribed by Pillai et al.(2006) .Separation of the cysteine isotopomers was accomplished based on procedures re- ported by Lu et al.(2006) with modi ﬁcations using a Synergi Fusion-RP 80 column (250 !2m m!4mm) (Phenomenex Co., Torrance, CA).The mobile phase followed a gradientelution pro ﬁle of 0.1% tri ﬂuoroacetic acid with water (sol- vent A) and 0.1% tri ﬂuoroacetic acid with methanol (sol- vent B).The column equilibration time was 8 minbetween injections and the solvent ﬂow rate was maintained at 0.1 ml per minute.The elution gradient pro ﬁle followed was 0 min –3% B; 8 min –3% B, 18 min –95% B; 25 min –95% B; 27 min –3% B; 35 min –3% B.
Determination of Metabolic Pathways Isotopic enrichment measurements for methionine and cysteine were performed to understand the remethy-lation and transsulfuration pathways ( Lu et al., 2006 ; Pillai et al., 2006 ). Brie ﬂy, the relative contribution to methionine formation via homocysteine remethylation by MFMT pathway or BHMT pathway was calculatedfor control group based on the value of Met (M 12/M 10)/Met (M 13/M10).This expression was based on the assumption that [2H3] methionine was formedfrom betaine via BHMT and [ 2H2] methionine was formed from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, via MFMT, orig-inally from serine.Both the contributions from BHMT pathway or MFMT pathway to methionine formation was expressed in percentage.Furthermore, the deriva-tions on total remethylation and transsulfurationpathways for homocysteine were made.
The relative dis- tribution of labeled serine between remethylation via MFMT and transsulfuration was calculated based on the value of [ 2H2] methionine (M 12/M10)/[2H3] cysteine (M 13/M10). The relative distribution of ho- mocysteine undergoing the remethylation pathway (viaboth MFMT and BHMT) compared with the transsulfu-ration pathway was measured by separately determiningthe expressions for remethylation or transsulfuration: where A5½ 2H2/C138Met ðM12½2H3/C138cysteine ðM13M10Þ; =/C14 Transsulfuration ð%Þ5100 /C0Remethylation via MFMT and BHMT ð%Þ: Measurement of Time-Course Labeling of Metabolites The time course labeling of hepatic free methionine (13C-Met) pool was measured over the 480 min after exposure of [13C] methionine for control group.
Similarly, hepatic free cysteine enrichment (2H3–Cysteine) and he- patic free methionine (2H2- Met) were also measure at different time points over 120 min after exposure of [13C] methionine, [2, 3, 3-2H3]-serine, and [2H11] betaine for all 3 treatment groups. Statistical Analysis All the data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance using SAS procedures (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).Differences between means for amino acids analyzed were compared using the Duncan multiplerange test where control-de ﬁcient pyridoxine, or control-de ﬁcient folic acid was compared with the con- trol group.Differences in mean enrichment values be-tween treatments for time course of labeling forhepatic free methionine (M 11) pool, hepatic free cysteine (M 13) pool, and hepatic free methionine (M 12) pool were compared using all pairs, Tukey HSD test.

Metabolic Pathways The relative contribution to methionine formation by homocysteine remethylation via betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.5, BHMT) was 25 to 49%and via 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyl-transferase (EC 2.1.1.13, MFMT) was 51 to 75% 30 to120 min after labeled betaine injection ( Table 3 ). In addi- tion, the relative distribution of labeled serine betweenremethylation pathway via 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-ho-mocysteine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.13, MFMT) and transsulfuration pathway was obtained with the ratios of methionine (M 12/M10) to cysteine (M 13/M1 0).No signi ﬁcant change in the relative distribution of labeled serine between the remethylation pathway (viaMFMT) and transsulfuration pathway was observed,although there was a decreased trend for the MFMTpathway and an increased trend for transsulfurationpathway with time ( Table 4 ).
Aﬁnal calculation was con- ducted to determine the relative distribution of homocys- teine between the remethylation pathway via MFMTand BHMT and the transsulfuration pathway ( Tables 3and4). Sixty-one percent of homocysteine was remethy- lated via both the MFMT and BHMT reactions back tomethionine in 18-day-old chick embryos ( Table 5 ).Stable Isotope and Isotopomer Enrichment In the present study, a decrease in [13C] methionine enrichment was found over time ( Figure 1 ).In addition, [13C] methionine enrichment at 240 min (0.45) after in- jection was signi ﬁcantly lower than at 30 min (1.8) (Figure 2 ;P,0.05).Along with the isotopic enrich- ment, isotopomers were analyzed.Results showed thatthe M13 isotopomer of free cysteine did not appear within 30 min after injection; however, the enrichmentwas observed at 60 and 120 min after injection(Figure 3 ).No signi ﬁcant difference in cysteine enrich- ment (M 13/M10) among dietary treatments was observed ( Figure 3 ;P.0.05).
Examination of the [ 2H2] methionine enrichment revealed signi ﬁcantly greater enrichment in chick em- bryos from breeders fed without pyridoxine supplemen-tation 30 min after injection, as compared withenrichment from breeders fed control diets ( Figure 4 ; P,0.05). Alternatively, no signi ﬁcant changes after 1 or 2 h in hepatic [ 2H2] methionine in embryos from breeders fed the diets devoid of folic acid or pyridoxine supplementation was observed ( Figure 4 ;P.0.05) although both treatment groups were numerically higherthan the control group.DISCUSSION The increased levels of hepatic homocysteine from the pyridoxine-de ﬁcient treatment compared with control diet indicated impairment in methionine and homocyste- ine metabolism ( Table 2 ).
The increase in hepatic homo- cysteine in chick embryos, as observed in the presentstudy, agreed with previous reports of the elevations of00.511.522.5 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500[13C]Methioine Enrichment, M+1/M+0 Time after isotopes injection (minutes) * Figure 2.

Two-fold elevations in hepatic homocysteine of chick embryos from breedersfed de ﬁcient folic acid diets also indicated an impaired methionine/homocysteine metabolism, agreeing withprevious reports in humans and in rats ( Table 2 ) (Miller et al., 1994 ;Selhub, 1999 ;Cuskelly et al., 2001 ). Embryonic hepatic SAM levels in embryos decreased when breeders were fed a pyridoxine-de ﬁcient diet (Table 2 ).This was most likely due to an increase in phos- phatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase ( PEMT )activity, allowing the conversion of phosphatidylcholine at the expense of SAM.Shields et al.(2005) has reported that there is a high correlation between PEMT activityand plasma homocysteine.Thus, in the present study,the elevated homocysteine concentration frompyridoxine-de ﬁcient breeder diets could increase the ac- tivity of PEMT.
In addition, it has been found thatSAM levels were lower in rat livers that were de ﬁcient in B 6, further supporting the results observed in the pre- sent study ( Martinez et al., 2000 ). The signi ﬁcantly lower levels of spermine from both pyridoxine and folic acidtreatments may indicate a state of diapause, considering-0.00500.0050.010.0150.020.0250.03 20 40 60 80 100 120 140[2H3]Cysteine Enrichment.M+3/M+0 Time after isotops in jection (minutes) Control Folic acid B6 Figure 3.Time course of labeling of hepatic free cysteine pool from [13C] methionine, [2,3,3-2H3]-serine and [2H11] betaine administered by amnion injection into 18-day-old chick embryos from breeders fed test diets devoid of folic acid or pyridoxine supplementation.Note: Data points are means6SEM (n 56).0.0020.0040.0060.0080.010.0120.0140.0160.018 20 40 60 80 100 120 140[2H2]Methionine Enrichment, M+2/M+0 Time after isotopes injection (minutes) Control Folic acid B6 * Figure 4.

(1987) that suggests the chick embryo has a quick increase in protein content from the time of incubation.Considering the [ 13C] methionine enrichment decreased over time, an analysis on the speci ﬁc pathways was con- ducted for clarity of the nutritional and metabolic end points of this particular amino acid. Examination ofsamples revealed that the amount of remethylationfrom BHMT pathway (25 –49%) was similar to the 16 to 48% remethylation determined in broiler chick liverswith in vitro isotope betaine administration ( Pillai et al., 2006 ).N5-methyltetrahydrofolatehomocysteine accounted for about 65% of methionine formation via remethylation pathway in the chick embryo, which was in agreement with human research showing theMFMT pathway is the primary pathway forremethylation ( Table 3 )(Selhub, 1999 ).
In the embryo study presented herein, [2, 3, 3- 2H3]-serine was selected as a tracer to provide indications of remethylation ﬂux through MFMT by [2H2] methionine and transsulfuration ﬂux by [2H3] cysteine.

Sixty-one percent of homocysteine was remethylated via both MFMT and BHMT reactions back to methio- nine in 18-day-old chick embryos ( Table 5 ), which was higher than the values reported by Finkelstein and Martin (1984) andStorch et al. (1988) who conducted research on rats and humans, respectively.Storch et al.(1988) reported about 40% of homocysteine molecules formed were remethylated to methionine by using a con-stant intravenous infusion protocol, occurring over a 5-hour period, with [methyl- 2H3]- and [1-13C]-methionine in the postabsorptive state in human subjects.The 50% elevation in remethylation in chick embryoscompared with adult humans may suggest there is agreater demand for methionine during embryogenesisdue to higher protein synthesis rate, polyamines synthe-sis, and active methyl donor requirements.Storch et al.
(1988) suggested that the conservation of methionine during the post-absorptive state is associated with pro- tein synthesis, which is consistent with the suggestion byLu et al. (2020a) that methionine conservation is pri- mary in chick embryos and young hatched chicks for or-gan growth and protein deposition.Finkelstein and Martin (1984) demonstrated that remethylation ac- counts for 54% of homocysteine consumed in anin vitro system which approximated the in vivo condi-tion in rat liver.The M13 isotopomer of free cysteine did not occur un- til 60 or 120 min after injection for all test embryos(Figure 3 ).The slow formation of cysteine either with or without adequate vitamins may indicate slowercysteine synthesis if the cysteine requirement has notbeen adequately met for chick embryos at the late embry- onic stage.The transsulfuration pathway may be limiting in 18-day-old chick embryos.
The synthesis of cysteinefrom serine and homocysteine via transsulfurationpathway is catalyzed by cystathionine ß-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) and cystathionase, and both of these enzymesrequire vitamin B 6.Lu et al. (2020b) recently reported lower levels of cystathionine ß-synthase in the E10-E21 embryo liver and from day 1 to day 7 in the liver of hatched chicks compared with cystathionine ß-synthase in 35 to 49 d broilers.No signi ﬁcant difference in cysteine enrichment (M 13/M10) from the pyridoxine-de ﬁcient treatment ( Figure 3 ) was observed, which is consistent with the ﬁndings of Davis et al.(2005) that vitamin B 6re- striction in young men and women did not changecysteine ﬂux from transsulfuration pathway.This was determined by using a protocol of primed, constant infu- sion of [ 13C5] methionine, [3-13C] serine, and [2H2] cysteine (Davis et al., 2005 ).Martinez et al.
(2000) reported enrichment data of cysteine (M 13/M10) with a dose- ﬂooding protocol with [2H3] leucine, [1-13C] methio- nine, and [2H3] serine. A signi ﬁcant increase in cysteine (M13/M10) enrichment was observed in a rat liver with a vitamin B 6deﬁcient diet.However, a signi ﬁcant reduction in cysteine (M 13/M10) enrichment wasTable 3.The relative contributions to methionine formation via remethylation between BHMT pathway and MFMT pathway.Time (Min)[2H2]Met (M 12/M10)/[2H3] met (M 13/ M10)1MFMT2(%) BHMT2(%) 30 3.04 75.25 24.75 60 1.02 50.57 49.42120 2.76 73.41 26.59 Average 2.27 65 35 1Calculated from means of Met (M 12/M10) (n54)/means of Met (M 13/M10) (n54).At each time point, 4 embryos received [2, 3, 3-2H3]-L-serine and another 4 embryos received [2H11]-L-betaine.2[2H3] methionine was formed from betaine via BHMT and [2H2] methionine was formed from 5- methyltetrahydrofolate, via MFMT, originally from serine.
The relative contribution to methio-nine formation via homocysteine remethylation by MFMT pathway or BHMT pathway wascalculated based on the ratio of Met (M 12/M10)/Met (M 13/M10).

(2000) suggested that increasing hepatic cysteine production may be the result of the system compensating for impaired whole-body transsulfuration. Ubbink et al.(1996) reported that a vitamin B 6deﬁciency may contribute to impaired transsulfuration in humans, inaccordance with the response of plasma concentrationof homocysteine, cystathionine, and cysteine after amethionine load.The ﬁnding of unchanged cysteine (M 13/M10) in 18-day-old chick embryos from breeders fed without pyridoxine supplementation may be attrib- uted to a limited transsulfuration ability in chick em-bryos suggested by Lu et al.(2020a, 2020b) .Moreover, in accordance with the dissociation constants of CBS(0.7 umol/L) and SHMT (27.5 umol/L) ( Jones and Priest, 1978 ;Kery et al., 1999 ), it seems that during vitamin B 6deﬁciencies, the SHMT can be affected, but little or no effect on CBS is observed.
The observation of signi ﬁcantly greater hepatic [2H2] methionine enrichment in embryos from hens fedpyridoxine-de ﬁcient diets, than in those from hens fed control diets, 30 min after injection ( Figure 4 ), was consistent with the previous ﬁndings in rats that were subject to a dose- ﬂooding procedure at 30 min (Martinez et al., 2000 ). However, at time points 60 or 120 min after injection, the [ 2H2] methionine enrichment was similar between those fed the control and de ﬁcient B6 diets.The results observed in this study weredifferent than those reported by Martinez et al.(2000) in which rats, 60 or 120 min after injection, had a signif-icantly reduced hepatic [ 2H2] methionine for those fed the B 6deﬁcient diet compared with those fed adequate B6.Studies have shown that [2H2] methionine enrich- ment in the plasma was similar between adequate and deﬁcient B 6in humans ( Cuskelly et al., 2001 ) and rats (Martinez et al., 2000 ).
This behavior was similar in the present study where the de ﬁciency of pyridoxine did not affect the homocysteine remethylation in liversof chick embryos. The observation that there were no signi ﬁcant changes in hepatic [ 2H2] methionine enrichment from folic acid treatment ( Figure 4 ) was consistent with the enrichment data of Cuskelly et al., in which humans were supplied with a constant infusion.However, Cuskelly et al.(2001) believed that folic acid de ﬁciencies depressed therelative synthesis of methionine by homocysteine reme- thylation when R appearance Met/R appearance Leu was considered as the relative synthesis rate for methionine, based on the assumption that proteolysis of body proteinwould release methionine in direct proportion to therelease of leucine.
CONCLUSIONS Although the ﬁndings in the present study indicate that folic acid and pyridoxine are important for methi-onine metabolism and play a critical role in breederperformance, and thereafter, chick embryonic develop-ment, further research should be conducted to createa more representative database regarding methionineand cysteine kinetics in chick embryos. Studies with sta-ble isotope amino acids are required to determine whether (or how) pyridoxine nutritional status affects the synthesis of cysteine in chick embryos.Researchfrom the present study indicates the chick embryoprefers methionine conservation, rather than catabolismof methionine to cysteine.Therefore, supplyingadequate folic acid and pyridoxine in broiler breederdiets is necessary for chick embryonic methioninemetabolism.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank Cobb-Vantress, Inc.for providing the Cobb 500 breeder chicks.
