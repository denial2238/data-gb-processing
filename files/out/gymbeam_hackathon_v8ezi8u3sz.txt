Bryant OMT-28 is a metabolically robust small molecule devel- oped to mimic the structure and function of omega-3epoxyeicosanoids. However, it remained unknown to whatextent OMT-28 also shares the cardioprotective and anti-inﬂammatory properties of its n atural counterparts.To address this question, we analyzed the ability of OMT-28 to ameliorate hypoxia/reoxygenat ion (HR)-injury and lipopoly- saccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia in cultured car-diomyocytes.Moreover, we investigated the potential ofOMT-28 to limit functional damage and in ﬂammasome activation in isolated perfused mouse hearts subjected toischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury.In the HR model, OMT-28(1 mM) treatment largely preserved cell viability (about 75 versus 40% with the vehicle) and mitochondrial function as indicated by the maintenance of NAD+/NADH-, ADP/ATP-,and respiratory control ratios.Moreover, OMT-28 blockedthe HR-induced production of mitochondrial reactive oxy-gen species.
Pharmacological inhibition experiments sug- gested that G ai, PI3K, PPAR a, and Sirt1 are essential components of the OMT-28-medi ated pro-survival pathway. Counteracting in ﬂammatory injury of cardiomyocytes, OMT-28 (1 mM) reduced LPS-induced increases in TNF a protein (by about 85% versus vehicle) and NF- kBD N A binding (by about 70% versus vehicle).In the ex vivo model, OMT-28 improved post-IR myoc ardial function recovery to reach about 40% of the baseline value compared to less than20% with the vehicle.Furthermore, OMT-28 (1 mM) limited IR-induced NLRP3 in ﬂammasome activation similarly to a direct NLRP3 inhibitor (MCC950).Overall, this study dem- onstrates that OMT-28 possesses potent cardio-protective and anti-in ﬂammatory properties supporting the hypothesis that extending the bioavailability of omega-3 epox-yeicosanoids may improve their prospects as therapeuticagents.
N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), eicosa- pentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), canbe endogenously metabolized into bioactive epoxylipids by cytochrome P450 enzymes ( 1,2). Numerous studies have suggested that increased consumption of n-3 PUFAs decreasesthe morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular disease.Dietary supplementation with EPA and DHA has resulted in increased plasma and tissue levels of the epoxylipids, 17,18- epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-EEQ), and 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid (19,20-EDP) ( 1,3,4).These n- 3-derived FA epoxides (n-3 EpFA) display pleiotropic effectsincluding cardioprotective ( 5,6), antihypertensive ( 7), anti- inﬂammatory ( 8–10), and anti ﬁbrotic ( 11) properties that may contribute to the bene ﬁcial effects of n-3 LC-PUFAs in cardiovascular disease ( 2).
Preclinical animal studies demon- strate synthetic analogs of n-3 epoxyeicosanoids can amelio- rate ischemia-reperfusion injury ( 12,13), laser-induced choroidal neovascularization ( 8), and LPS-induced endotox- emia ( 14). EPA and DHA-derived epoxylipids undergo rapid autoxi- dation, membrane incorporation, and enzymatic metabolismby cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and epoxide hydrolasesunder normal physiological conditions ( 2).To overcome these limitations, chemically and metabolically robust synthetic an- alogs of 17,18-EEQ have been developed ( 15,16).Improved drug-like properties were achieved by modifying the chemicalstructure of natural metabolites while preserving their effectson cardiomyocyte contraction ( Fig.1 ).Among the 17,18-EEQ analogs synthesized, OMT-28, showed superior metabolicstability, high oral bioavailability, and favorable pharmacoki-netics ( 15).
OMT-28 is currently investigated in Phase II clinical studies in patients with cardiovascular and mito- chondrial disease by OMEICOS Therapeutics ( https:// omeicos.com/ ). In the present study, we investigate the cardioprotective properties of our novel synthetic analog compared to anaturally occurring epoxylipid, 19,20-EDP.To this end, wetested OMT-28 for its ability to protect cardiac cells againstHR- and LPS-induced injury.Moreover, we analyzed OMT- 28 effects on ischemia/reperfusion injury using isolated perfused hearts.‡These authors contributed equally to this work.*For correspondence: John M.Seubert, jseubert@ualberta.ca .RESEARCH ARTICLE J.Biol.Chem.(2024) 300(6) 107372 1 © 2024 THE AUTHORS.Published by Elsevier Inc on behalf of American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.This is an open access article unde r the CC BY license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ).Figure 1.OMT-28 protects HL-1 cells against HR injury.

(2024) 300(6) 107372 Results OMT-28 protects cardiomyocytes against hypoxia/ reoxygenation-induced loss of cell viability and mitochondrialfunction Cytoprotective effects of OMT-28 in cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation injury First, we assessed cytoprotection by OMT-28 and various EpFAs using a HL-1 murine cardiac cell hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) injury model. In parallel, we compared OMT-28 to its endogenous analog, 17,18-EEQ.17,18-EEQ was added either asthe R,S-enantiomer, the S,R-enantiomer, or as the racemicmixture of 17,18-EEQ.OMT-28 was also compared to anothercardioprotective endogenous n-3 PUFA epoxide, 19,20-EDP(12,17).All compounds were also co-treated with tAUCB to assess whether sEH-mediated hydrolysis inhibits the bene ﬁcial effects of epoxyeicosanoid treatment.Using the CCK-8 assay to measure cell viability, we observed no cytotoxic effects for any compound under nor-moxic conditions ( Fig.1 B).
HR injury alone reduced cell viability to 40% of normoxic control (vehicle HR versus vehicle normoxia in Fig. 1 B).Both OMT-28 and 17(R),18(S)-EEQ signiﬁcantly limited cell loss compared to HR-vehicle control (1.7-fold and 1.4-fold respectively), but 17(S),18(R)-EEQ orracemic 17,18-EEQ failed to protect the cells.Cells incubated with 19,20-EDP signi ﬁcantly increased metabolic activity after HR-injury compared to HR control (1.9-fold higher).Consistent with previous studies ( 18,19),tAUCB co- treatment moderately improved 17(R),18(S)-EEQ cytopro-tection (to 1.6-fold HR control), presumably because limitingsEH-mediated hydrolysis improves the long-term stability ofthis compound.Notably, sEH inhibition did not improve theefﬁcacy of 17(S),18(R)-EEQ or racemic 17,18-EEQ, suggesting that the R,S-enantiomer is likely the dominant bioactive molecule.In contrast, tAUCB co-treatment did not enhance 19,20-EDP-mediated cytoprotection, despite 19,20-EDP pos-sessing an sEH-labile epoxide group.
Inhibition of sEH did notaffect OMT-28 ef ﬁciency, as expected. Samokhvalov et al.(17) previously identi ﬁed the capacity of 19,20-EDP to protect cardiac oxidative metabolism againsthypoxic insult.Thus, we assessed OMT-28 and other endogenous n-3 EpFAs for their ability to protect mitochon- drial oxidative metabolism using an MTT reduction assay(Fig.1 C).Interestingly, we observed that both 19,20-EDP and OMT-28 signi ﬁcantly increased MTT reduction already at normoxic conditions (1.4- and 1.3-fold of normoxic control,respectively), and both compounds also rescued MTTreduction in HR injury (both 2.2-fold of HR control).Addi-tionally, while 17(R),18(S)-EEQ treatment alone could not signiﬁcantly increase MTT reduction above HR control levels, 17(R),18(S)-EEQ plus tAUCB treatment signi ﬁcantly restored MTT reduction in HR (1.9-fold HR control).tAUCB co- treatment did not enhance MTT reduction for any othercompound.
Overall, these data suggest that OMT-28 possesses potent cytoprotective effects against HR injury in HL-1 cardiac cellssimilar to endogenous EpFA comparators at a given concen- tration of 1 mM. PI3Ka,Gai, PPAR a, and SIRT1 are involved in OMT-28-mediated cytoprotection against HR injury To further investigate cytoprotective mechanisms of OMT- 28 in cardiac cells following HR injury, we used selective pharmacological inhibitors to conduct a limited screen of putative signaling pathways involved in the OMT-28response; speci ﬁcally, PI3K ( 20,21), G protein subunits ( 22), sarcolemmal ATP-dependent potassium (sK ATP) channel ( 23), PPARs ( 24–26), and SIRT1 ( 17) have all been associated with endogenous n-3/n-6 PUFA epoxide activity.Additionally,because OMT-28 signi ﬁcantly outperformed endogenous 17,18-EEQ enantiomers in our HL-1 HR injury model, we used 19,20-EDP as the sole comparator molecule to OMT- 28 for subsequent in vitro experiments.
We also utilized pri- mary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) for our remain-ing in vitro HR injury experiments, as they are more phenotypically like terminally differentiated in vivo car- diomyocytes ( 27). Weﬁrst assessed the role of PI3K using wortmannin (WM), a broad PI3K class I, II, and III inhibitor ( 28–30).100 nM WM pre-treatment almost completely ablated 19,20-EDP- and OMT-28-mediated cytoprotection against HR (from 2.2- to1.2-fold, and 2.1- to 1.3-fold HR control viability, respectively)(Fig.2 A).However, this was confounded by the observation that WM pre-treatment alone was signi ﬁcantly cytotoxic at normoxia (0.7-fold normoxic control) and HR (0.5-fold HRcontrol).To ascertain the role of PI3K more speci ﬁcally, we utilized a PI3K a-selective inhibitor, PI-103 ( Fig.2 B)(31,32).
PI-103 pre-treatment alone was not signi ﬁcantly cytotoxic at any concentration compared to normoxic or HR controls.Interestingly, while PI-103 pre-treatment did not affect 19,20-EDP-mediated cytoprotection at any concentration, OMT-28-mediated cytoprotection was ablated by PI-103 in aconcentration-dependent manner, suggesting that cytopro-tection by OMT-28 but not 19,20-EDP is dependent on PI3K a. PTX was used to assess the involvement of G aiprotein signaling in OMT-28-mediated protection against HR injury (33).PTX completely blocked both 19,20-EDP and OMT-28- mediated cytoprotection against HR injury ( Fig.2 C).Addi- tionally, OMT-28 in combination with PTX signi ﬁcantly worsened HR-induced loss of cell viability (0.5-fold HRcontrol), suggesting additional cytotoxic mechanisms duringHR injury that are not activated by PTX plus 19,20-EDP in HRinjury nor PTX plus OMT-28 at normoxia.
PPARs are a family of nuclear hormone receptor tran- scription factors that have been shown to be targets of EpFAsignaling ( 9,25,26,34). To investigate the involvement of PPARs in our model, we used co-treatments with eitherGSK3787, GW6471, or GW9662 to selectively inhibit PPARsisoforms b/d(35),a(36), and g(37), respectively.Under normoxic conditions, non-signi ﬁcant reductions in cell viability were observed for both GSK3787 and GW9662 inOMT-28 cardioprotection J.Biol.Chem.(2024) 300(6) 107372 3 Figure 2.OMT-28 protects NRCMs against HR injury through pleiotropic mechanisms.The cytoprotective effect of OMT-28 was reduced by various inhibitors following HR injury in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.NRCM subjected to normoxia or hypoxia-reoxygenation were treated with vehicle, 19, 20-EDP (1mM), or OMT-28 (1 mM) with or without inhibitors.A, pan-PI3K inhibition with Wortmannin (WM, 100 nM).B, PI3K a-selective inhibition with PI-103 (100 nM).

These observations of cytotoxicity at nor-moxia likely do not fully account for the total blockage ofGW6471 against OMT-28 mediated cytoprotection, as well as GW9662 completely blocking 19,20-EDP-mediated cytopro- tection in HR injury. Interestingly, GW9662 only moderatelyblunted OMT-28-mediated cytoprotection against HR whileGSK3787 had no effect.In contrast, 19,20-EDP-mediatedcytoprotection was mildly inhibited by GW6471, whileGSK3787 had no effect.This data suggests that OMT-28-mediated cytoprotection in HR injury is mostly dependentupon PPAR aactivity, while 19,20-EDP is dependent upon PPAR gactivity.Supporting these observations, PPAR aDNA binding activity was signi ﬁcantly increased by OMT-28 alone at normoxic conditions (1.7-fold normoxic control) but not19,20-EDP, and this was completely blocked by GW6471(Fig.2 E).OMT-28 also rescued PPAR aDNA binding activity following HR injury (2.0-fold HR control) with this effect alsobeing blocked by GW6471.
Additionally, while 19,20-EDP hadno effect on PPAR aDNA binding activity, 19,20-EDP but not OMT-28 enhanced PPAR gDNA binding activity at both normoxia and HR, and this was completely blocked by co-treatment with GW9662 ( Fig. 2 F).sK ATPchannels are known to be activated by arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids ( 38–40).Interestingly, co-treatment with the selective sK ATPchannel inhibitor, HMR 1098 ( 41) did neither block 19,20-EDP- nor OMT-28- mediated rescue of cell viability against HR injury ( Fig.2 G), demonstrating that OMT-28 and 19,20-EDP may utilize distinct signaling mechanisms compared to other car-dioprotective EpFAs in NRCMs.SIRT1 activity has been associated with EpFA/PUFA signaling in several experimental models ( 17,42–44).To assess the role of SIRT1 in OMT-28-mediated cardioprotection, wemeasured SIRT1 activity in NRCMs following normoxia or HR(Fig.3 A).Both 19,20-EDP and OMT-28 signi ﬁcantly increased SIRT1 activity under normoxia.
While HR injury greatly ab- lated SIRT1 activity compared to normoxic control, both19,20-EDP and OMT-28 rescued SIRT1 activity following HR.Interestingly, OMT-28-mediated SIRT1 activation was fullyblocked by GW6471 in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions,demonstrating that OMT-28-mediated SIRT1 activation isdependent on PPAR aactivation ( Fig. 3 A).Conversely, 19,20- EDP-mediated SIRT1 activation was not blunted to any de- gree by GW9662 at either normoxia or HR, suggesting that 19,20-EDP-mediated SIRT1 activation is not dependent onPPAR gactivation ( Fig.3 A).In HL-1 cells, we demonstrated that the SIRT1-speci ﬁc inhibitor EX-527 ablated OMT-28- mediated rescue of cell viability and 20S proteasome activity(Fig.3 ,Band C).
Finally, to assess the effect of OMT-28 on mitochondrial biogenesis, a process coupled to SIRT1 andPGC-1 ɑ, we measured the ratio of protein levels of mito- chondrial DNA-coded cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COX-1) and nuclear DNA-encoded succinate dehydrogenase sub- unit A (SDH-A) in NRCMs ( Fig. 3 D)(45,46).As expected, HR injury induced a pronounced drop in COX-1/SDH-A ratio(/C240.2-fold normoxic control).OMT-28 signi ﬁcantly rescued COX-1/SDH-A ratio following HR injury, and this was morepotent compared to 19,20-EDP (3.8- and 2.5-fold HR control,respectively).In addition, only OMT-28 signi ﬁcantly increased COX-1/SDH-A ratio at normoxic conditions, while 19,20-EDP had no effect.Overall, OMT-28-mediated cytoprotection against HR injury is dependent upon PI3K a,Gai, PPAR a, and SIRT1 signaling pathways, with OMT-28-mediated SIRT1 activationbeing dependent upon PPAR aactivity.Activation of SIRT1 appears to have a meaningful impact on mitobiogenesisfollowing HR injury.
This data demonstrates clear differences in signaling mechanisms between OMT-28 and the endoge- nous comparator 19,20-EDP, despite both exhibiting compa-rable degrees of cytoprotection in cardiomyocyte HR injurymodels. OMT-28 preserves mitochondrial function following cardiomyocyte HR injury Among other EpFAs, 17,18-EEQ and 19,20-EDP have been shown to preserve mitochondria as part of their protective mechanisms of action ( 12,14,47).Thus, we hypothesized that OMT-28 also protects against HR-induced cardiac mito-chondrial damage ( Fig.4 A).
Using permeabilized NRCMs following normoxia or HR injury, we ﬁrst assessed the effect of OMT-28 on respiratory control ratio (RCR), a metric formitochondrial ef ﬁciency ( i.e., coupling of ADP phosphoryla- tion to respiration) by measuring the ratio between respiration rate when mitochondria are maximally converting ADP to ATP and respiration rate at minimal conversion of ADP toATP ( i.e., respiration largely due to electron leak and non- mitochondrial oxygen consumption) ( 48). Complex I-medi- ated respiration experiments demonstrated that HR injurysigniﬁcantly reduced RCR from /C247t o /C242 in vehicle-treated NRCMs.Supporting our hypothesis, RCR was signi ﬁcantly rescued by either 19,20-EDP or OMT-28 (2.5-fold HR control) (Fig.4 B).We also observed a non-signi ﬁcant increase of complex I-mediated RCR to /C248.5 by OMT-28 alone in nor- moxic conditions.
Additionally, HR injury signi ﬁcantly reduced RCR from 5.5 to /C243 in complex II-mediated respi- ration experiments in vehicle-treated NRCMs ( Fig. 4 C).Interestingly, only OMT-28 signi ﬁcantly rescued complex II- mediated RCR following HR injury (2.2-fold HR control),while 19,20-EDP-mediated restoration of RCR did not reach statistical signi ﬁcance (1.5-fold HR control).Additionally, no effect on complex II-mediated RCR was observed by 19,20-EDP or OMT-28 treatment at normoxic conditions.Sup-porting these observations, the HR-induced reduction inNAD+/NADH ratio ( Fig.4 D) and the HR-induced increase in ADP/ATP ( Fig.4 E) were both signi ﬁcantly blocked by either 19,20-EDP or OMT-28.However, OMT-28 appeared toOMT-28 cardioprotection J.Biol.Chem.(2024) 300(6) 107372 5 improve ADP/ATP ratio in HR injury moderately better than 19,20-EDP (0.3-fold and 0.5-fold HR control, respectively).
To further investigate the mechanism of OMT-28-mediated preservation of mitochondrial function against HR injury, weassessed maximal activities of individual electron transportchain (ETC) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enzymes inmitochondrial fractions from NRCMs. For ETC enzyme ac-tivity experiments, non-signi ﬁcant increases in complex I ac- tivity by 19,20-EDP or OMT-28 treatment were observed at both normoxic conditions and HR injury compared to their vehicle controls, although OMT-28 was more potent than19,20-EDP in this manner ( Fig.4 F).Additionally, the HR- induced elevation in complex II activity was signi ﬁcantly ab- lated by 19,20-EDP or OMT-28 (both 0.4-fold HR control),while no effects were observed at normoxic conditions(Fig.4 G).19,20-EDP and OMT-28 only moderately restored complex IV activity following HR injury (both 1.6-fold HR control), but these both did not reach statistical signi ﬁcance (Fig.4 H).
Aconitase activity was rescued to a similar degree by19,20-EDP or OMT-28 following HR-injury (2.1- and 2.2-fold HR control, respectively), while only OMT-28 signi ﬁcantly increased aconitase activity (1.5-fold) at normoxic conditions(Fig. 4 I).For TCA cycle enzyme activity experiments, both 19,20-EDP and OMT-28 appeared to rescue citrate synthaseactivity following HR injury in NRCMs (2.3-fold and 3.2-foldHR control, respectively), but only OMT-28 reached statisti-cal signi ﬁcance and was also more potent than 19,20-EDP in this manner.OMT-28 also non-signi ﬁcantly increased citrate synthase activity at normoxic conditions (1.5-fold normoxic control) ( Fig.4 J).Overall, OMT-28 provides equal or greater improvement of mitochondrial ETC or TCA cycle enzymaticactivities compared to 19,20-EDP in HR injury.

Biol.Chem.(2024) 300(6) 107372 (mitoROS) and dysfunctional mitochondria during HR injury occur due to respiratory chain disruption and impaired auto-phagy ( 49–52).Thus, we hypothesized that OMT-28 would suppress HR-induced mitoROS formation.Furthermore, wetreated NRCMs with OMT-28 (or 19,20-EDP) at either the beginning of hypoxia ( Fig.5 ,Aand B) or at re-oxygenation (Fig.5 ,Cand D) to assess the dependence of protection byOMT-28 on the phase of HR injury OMT-28 is added.

OMT-28 protects cardiomyocytes against in ﬂammatory injury Mitochondrial dysfunction and mitoROS production largely inﬂuence pro-in ﬂammatory signaling, the degree of which greatly in ﬂuences the severity and pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury ( 49,53). We also speculated that OMT-28 would be cytoprotective and anti-in ﬂammatory in an LPS-induced in ﬂammatory injury model in HL-1 cells and NRCMs.After 24 h of LPS treatment, viability of HL-1 cellswas reduced to /C2440% in the vehicle group.OMT-28 treated HL-1 cells showed a concentration-dependent response (60% (10 nM), 80% (100 nM) and 90% (1 mM),Fig.6 A).OMT-28 was cytoprotective against LPS challenge at all testedtreatment times (1, 6, 12, and 24-h) in HL-1 cells, signi ﬁcantly rescuing cell viability ( Fig.6 B).Both OMT-28 and control compound 19,20-EDP limited cell death as observed not only in CCK-8 viability experiments but also in MTT activation and20S proteasome activity ( Fig.6 ,Cand D).
Both OMT-28 and 19,20-EDP increased overall mitochondrial oxidative capacityreﬂected by increased MTT reduction already under non- stressed conditions ( Fig. 6 ).The observed cell protective ef- fects, especially of OMT-28, were SIRT1 dependent, i.e., Ex- 527 blocked the OMT-28 mediated bene ﬁcial effects on cell viability, MTT reduction, and proteasome activity ( Fig.6 ).Interestingly, OMT-28 appeared to be more potent than19,20-EDP in this manner, as OMT-28 began to signi ﬁcantly block LPS-induced loss of cell viability earlier (12 h) than19,20-EDP (24 h).To investigate the anti-in ﬂammatory potential of OMT-28, we measured the levels of several cytokines in HL-1 andNRCM cell culture media following 24-h LPS challenge.Similar to trends observed in the cell viability data, both 19,20- EDP and OMT-28 signi ﬁcantly blocked LPS-induced secretion of TNF a(Fig.7 ,Aand B), MCP-1 ( Fig.7 C), and TGF- b (Fig.7 D), but OMT-28 was more potent in all cases when compared to 19,20-EDP.

We measured NF- kB DNA binding activity in NRCMs during the acute in ﬂammatory phase (at 1 h) of LPS- challenge and observed that both 19,20-EDP and OMT-28 signiﬁcantly blocked LPS-induced NF- kB DNA binding ac- tivity ( Fig.7 E).OMT-28 was more potent than 19,20-EDP here as well, supporting our cell viability and cytokine secretiondata.Overall, these data suggest OMT-28 possesses greater cytoprotective and anti-in ﬂammatory ef ﬁcacy than 19,20-EDP in HL-1 cells and NRCMs challenged with LPS.Furthermore, OMT-28 demonstrates protective properties in multiple in vitro cardiac injury models, potentially mediated throughshared signaling pathways ( e.g., mitochondrial damage, innate inﬂammation, ROS generation).
OMT-28 improves post-ischemic contractile recovery and inhibits in ﬂammasome activation in isolated murine hearts OMT-28 improves post-ischemic contractile recovery As OMT-28 exhibited marked cardioprotection in multiple in vitro cardiac injury models, we tested the functional rele- vance of these data using ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury-subjected isolated murine hearts perfused in theLangendorff-mode. Additionally, we looked for indications of a cell death pathway commonly associated with IR injury, the NLRP3 in ﬂammasome ( 56), a multi-protein complex that Figure 7.OMT-28 limits LPS-induced in ﬂammation in cardiac cells.Analysis of several in ﬂammatory markers expressed by cardiac cells exposed to 24 h LPS (1 mg/ml) and treated with either vehicle, 19,20-EDP or OMT-28.A, ELISA quanti ﬁcation of TNF aexpression in HL-1 treated with either vehicle, 19,20-EDP or OMT-28 (10 nM, 100 nM, and 1 mM) following LPS insult.Analysis of in ﬂammatory markers in NRCM.

Considering the cytopro- tective and anti-in ﬂammatory effects of OMT-28 in vitro ,w e also hypothesized that OMT-28 may be cardioprotective in myocardial IR injury through inhibition of the NLRP3inﬂammasome. In this regard, we compared the car- dioprotective effects of OMT-28 in isolated murine hearts withthat of the speci ﬁc NLRP3 in ﬂammasome inhibitor MCC-950, which has already been demonstrated to be cardioprotective inseveral IR injury models ( 61,62).Supporting our in vitro data, both OMT-28 and MCC-950 signiﬁcantly rescued myocardial functional parameters whencompared to IR control hearts.OMT-28-treated hearts had a percent left ventricular developed pressure (%LVDP of base-line) 2-fold higher than IR controls, 40 min after reperfusion(R40), while MCC950-treated hearts had 3-fold higher %LVDPat R40 compared to IR controls ( Fig.8 ,Aand D).Similarly, both IR-induced reduction of the rate of contraction (dp/dtmax) ( Fig.8 ,BandE) and rate of relaxation (dp/dt min) ( Fig.
8 , Cand F) at R40 were signi ﬁcantly rescued by either OMT-28 or MCC-950, while heart rates at R40 were not signi ﬁcantly different between any treatment group ( Fig. 8 G).Overall, OMT-28 rescued post-ischemic myocardial function to asimilar degree compared to NLRP3 in ﬂammasome inhibition by MCC-950.This data demonstrates the functional relevanceof our in vitro observations, providing important evidence that OMT-28 is cardioprotective against IR injury at both the cellular and organ level.Figure 8.OMT-28 enhances postischemic-reperfusion myocardial function recovery.Perfusion of hearts with OMT-28 (1 mM) or MCC950 (1 mM) resulted in improved postischemic functional recovery.A, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) at baseline before drug treatment (B 20), during ischemia, and at 10, 20, 30, and 40 min following reperfusion (R 10,R20,R30, and R 40).B, rate of contraction (dP/dt max).C, rate of relaxation (dP/dt min).

As OMT-28 strongly protected mitochondria against HR injury in vitro , we assessed mitochondrial fractions from isolated murine hearts for expression of mitophagicmarkers following IR injury. Levels of dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP1), a protein involved in mitochondrial ﬁssion, were markedly upregulated in mitochondrial fractions from IR control hearts (2-fold higher than aerobic control) ( Fig.9 A).This is expected as DRP1 accumulation in mitochondria followed by ﬁssion is an early mechanism to separate damaged mitochondria formitophagy ( 66,67).Supporting our previous observations, mitochondrial DRP1 in OMT-28-treated hearts was signi ﬁ- cantly lower than IR control hearts, being restored to levelscomparable to aerobic controls.Mitochondrial DRP1 in MCC950-treated hearts was also restored to near-aerobic control levels, although this was not signi ﬁcantly lower compared to IR control-treated hearts.
PINK1 accumulates on mitochondrial outer membranes because of mitochondrial damage, leading to recruitment andsubsequent activation of Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Parkinubiquitinates mitochondrial surface proteins, promoting directbinding of autophagy receptors such as p62 ( 68,69).A signi ﬁ- cant 2.1-fold increase in mitochondrial PINK1 levels was observed in IR control hearts compared to aerobic controls(Fig.9 B).Mitochondrial PINK1 levels in OMT-28 and MCC950-treated hearts were not signi ﬁcantly higher than aer- obic controls (1.4- and 1.1-fold higher, respectively), althoughthese were also not signi ﬁcantly different when compared to IR control hearts.Lastly, mitochondrial Parkin levels were 2.6-foldhigher in IR control hearts compared to aerobic controls, but OMT-28 or MCC950 signi ﬁcantly blocked IR-induced Parkin accumulation in mitochondrial fractions ( Fig.9 C).
Following the detection of mitochondrial damage, ubiq- uitination of selective proteins on the surfaces of mitochondriamediates speci ﬁc targeting of these mitochondria to mitoph- agy. The autophagy receptor protein, p62, acts as an adaptorbetween these ubiquitinated proteins and the lipidated proteinLC3-II, recruiting these mitochondria to mature autophago- somes and subsequent degradation ( 68,70).We observed that both p62 ( Fig.9 D) and LC3-II ( Fig.9 E) were heavily accu- mulated in mitochondrial fractions from IR control hearts(1.8- and 5-fold higher than aerobic controls, respectively),suggesting IR-induced activation of mitophagy.Both OMT-28and MCC950 treatment signi ﬁcantly decreased both mito- chondrial p62 and LC3-II compared to IR controls.
Overall, these data show that improved myocardial post- ischemic functional recovery by treatment with OMT-28 isassociated with a reduction of IR-induced mitophagy markers, suggesting that OMT-28 limited mitochondrial damage also inthis ex vivo model. Speci ﬁcally, PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy and classical recruitment of p62 and LC3-II to mito-chondria appear to be upregulated following IR injury andameliorated with the addition of OMT-28.OMT-28 prevents IR-induced accumulation of NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation markers Past works suggest that the NLRP3 in ﬂammasome is a target of EpFA compounds as a cardioprotective mechanism in myocardialIR injury ( 12).Thus, we assessed cytosolic fractions from isolated murine hearts for markers of NLRP3 in ﬂammasome activation.As previously observed in our model, cytosolic NLRP3 levels werestrongly upregulated by IR injury (6-fold aerobic control).
Strik-ingly, OMT-28 or MCC-950 restored cytosolic NLRP3 to levelsalmost equivalent to aerobic controls, and these were signi ﬁcantly lower when compared to IR control hearts ( Fig. 9 F).We also assessed cytosolic levels of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP).TXNIP and thioredoxin form an inhibitory complex at basal conditions, but as IR-induced oxidative stress ablates the thioredoxin-TXNIP interaction, TXNIP becomeselevated in the cytosol and directly interacts with NLRP3 topromote in ﬂammasome activation ( 71).We observed an 11- fold increase in cytosolic TXNIP levels in IR control heartscompared to aerobic control, although high variance withinthe IR control group prevented these groups from beingsigniﬁcantly different ( Fig.9 G).However, OMT-28 or MCC- 950 appeared to ablate IR-induced elevation of cytosolic TXNIP, restoring levels comparable to aerobic control hearts.
Following canonical NLRP3 in ﬂammasome activation, caspase-1 is a key mediator of pyroptotic cell death and in-ﬂammatory cytokine maturation ( 72–74). Thus, we measured caspase-1 activity in cytosolic fractions from isolated murinehearts.Supporting our previous observations, caspase-1 ac-tivity levels were signi ﬁcantly elevated in IR control hearts (1.9-fold higher compared to aerobic control), while OMT-28 and MCC950 successfully blocked IR-induced caspase-1 acti-vation ( Fig.9 H).Furthermore, we measured cytosolic levels of IL-1 b, a pro-in ﬂammatory cytokine that is proteolytically processed in the cytosol by caspase-1 prior to its secretion.Asexpected, IR hearts exhibited 2.4-fold higher cytosolic IL-1 b levels compared to aerobic controls, and this was signi ﬁcantly reduced by OMT-28 or MCC950 treatment ( Fig.9 I).
Overall, these data demonstrate that OMT-28-mediated protection of isolated murine hearts against myocardial IRinjury is associated with reduced NLRP3 in ﬂammasome acti- vation markers. These data support the cytoprotective and anti-inﬂammatory effects of OMT-28 observed in vitro and suggest that NLRP3 in ﬂammasome inhibition could be an important mechanism involved in OMT-28-mediated cardioprotection.Discussion This study shows that OMT-28, a synthetic analog of u-3 epoxyeicosanoids, exhibits similar and, in part, even superiorOMT-28 cardioprotection 12 J.Biol.Chem.(2024) 300(6) 107372 cytoprotective and anti-in ﬂammatory properties compared to its natural counterparts.The bene ﬁcial effects of OMT-28 relied on its ability to ameliorate stress-induced mitochon-drial dysfunction and in ﬂammasome activation ( Fig.
10 ), as revealed by our experiments in cultured cardiomyocytes and isolated perfused hearts.OMT-28 was developed based on structure-activity- relationship (SAR) studies that measured the effect of syn-thetic 17,18-EEQ analogs on cardiomyocyte contraction as amarker of their biological activity ( 15,16). The ﬁndings of the present study extend and support our previous hypothesis on the potential therapeutic use of OMT-28 in conditions of Figure 9.OMT-28 limits IR-induced in ﬂammasome and autophagy responses.Perfusion of hearts with OMT-28 (1 mM) or MCC950 (1 mM) inhibited IR- induced activation of mitochondrial autophagy and the NLRP3 in ﬂammasome.Representative immunoblots and densiometric quanti ﬁcation of mito- chondrial autophagy-associated markers and NLRP3 in ﬂammasome were assessed by immunoblotting.Protein expression was normalized to either VDAC (mitochondria) or GAPDH (cytosolic) loading controls.

At the same time, these SAR studies revealed how the chemically and metabolicallylabile 17,18-EEQ can be rendered into a more drug-like compound by reducing the number of double bonds, replac- ing the epoxy group with an epoxy-bioisoster, and introducinga 3-oxa group (see Fig. 1 Afor a comparison of 17,18-EEQ and OMT-28 structures).These speci ﬁc chemical modi ﬁcations resulted in compounds with largely improved oral bioavail-ability, metabolic stability, and even slightly increased effectson cardiomyocyte contraction ( 16).Furthermore, in these studies, OMT-28 displayed ef ﬁcacy in the low nanomolar range when tested in short-term experiments measuring its effects on the beating rate of NRCMs ( 15,16).However, OMT-28 shows high protein binding ( 15,16).Therefore, higher concentrations are required to achieve long-term ef-fects in cardiomyocytes cultured in the presence of FBS.
Asshown in Figures 6 and7A, OMT-28 exerts signi ﬁcant anti- inﬂammatory effects already at a concentration of 10 nM and this effect is saturated at a concentration of 1 mM. In contrast, 19,20-EDP starts to be effective only at a concen- tration of 100 nM.Importantly, the present study demon-strated for the ﬁrst time that the same chemical modi ﬁcations also maintain and improve the cardioprotective and anti-inﬂammatory properties of natural u-3 epoxyeicosanoids.Similar strategies were successful in generating metabolicallyrobust and functionally active analogs of other endogenousEpFAs ( 76,77).In our current study, OMT-28 and 19,20-EDP markedly ameliorated HR- and LPS-induced injury in both immortalized(HL-1) and primary cardiomyocytes (NRCM).At the molec- ular level, OMT-28 mediated effects in the HR model involvedPI3Kɑ,Gɑ i, PPAR ɑ, and SIRT1.19,20-EDP signaling was dependent on the same components but required PPAR g instead of PPAR a.
SIRT1 was also essential for the cytopro- tective effect of OMT-28 in the LPS model, where OMT-28reduced DNA binding of NF- kB and proin ﬂammatory cyto- kine expression. Our initial experiments revealed that the cardioprotective properties of 17,18-EEQ are stereospeci ﬁc and become more pronounced in the presence of sEH –inhibitors ( Fig.1 ).In contrast, 19,20-EDP, the DHA-derived omega-3 epoxide, was sufﬁciently stable and effective in racemic form.Therefore, we decided to use 19,20-EDP instead of the parental 17(R),18(S)-EEQ as a comparator to OMT-28 throughout all further ex-periments.Comparing the biological activities of 19,20-EDPand OMT-28, we observed not only common features butalso differences in their mode of action (MoA).Whereascommon features included all global cytoprotective and anti- inﬂammatory effects, distinct differences became obvious regarding the signaling pathways activated by the DHA-derived natural epoxide and the synthetic analog of 17,18-EEQ ( Table 1 ).
OMT-28 mediated effects in the HR model involved PI3K ɑ,Gɑi, PPAR ɑ, and Sirt1. 19,20-EDP signaling was similarly blocked by inhibitors against G ɑi (PTX) and Sirt1 (Ex-527) but required PPAR ginstead of PPAR aand was not affected by the PI3K inhibitor PI-103.Extending the common features at the molecular level, Sirt1 was also essential for the cytoprotective effects of 19,20-EDP and OMT-28 in the LPS Figure 10.Schematic of OMT-28 protective mechanisms.Conceptual illustration demonstrating the potential cardioprotective role OMT-28 has toward inﬂammatory and ischemic injury.Hearts subjected to stressors such as excessive in ﬂammation or ischemic injury have decreased viability, decrease mitochondrial quality, and elevated in ﬂammatory responses leading to reduced function.
OMT-28 protective effects are mediated viaan unknown GPCR leading to activation of an intracellular signaling pathway involving PPAR aand SIRT1 activation that preserves mitochondrial quality and limits in ﬂam- mation resulting in a robust cardioprotective response.

Evidence suggests that 17,18-EEQ could act through the prostacyclin receptor(IP) to sensitize neuronal TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors ( 82). Another group proposed that ethanolamide derivatives of both17,18-EEQ and 19,20-EDP suppress neuroin ﬂammation via the endocannabinoid receptor 2 coupled to beta-arrestin ac- tivity ( 83).Other groups demonstrated a role for sK ATP channels in u-3 epoxyeicosanoid-mediated vasodilation ( 38, 84,85); however, we did not observe any tangible effect of sKATPinhibition upon OMT-28 ’s ability to protect NRCMs.Further data from the current study indicates the protectiveaction of OMT-28 was blocked by PTX treatment, suggestingthe involvement of a G-protein coupled receptor that trans-duces signals to G ɑ iproteins ( 86,87).Interestingly, a previous study found that antagonizing PI3K with wortmannin abro- gated the cardioprotective effects exerted by the PPAR ɑ agonist WY-14643 against IR injury in male Wistar rats ( 88).
In line with this ﬁnding, we observed that OMT-28 mediated protection was attenuated following inhibition of PI3K. Activation of SIRT1 may be key for understanding the mode of action of OMT-28.Supporting this hypothesis, we foundthat OMT-28 increased SIRT1 activity in cardiomyocytes already under normal conditions and limited its decline after HR and LPS treatment.Importantly, pharmacological SIRT1inhibition blocked the cytoprotective and anti-in ﬂammatory effects of OMT-28 as shown in both models.These ﬁndings are in line with other reports showing an important role ofSIRT1 in activating adaptive responses toward stressors suchas HR injury ( 42,89,90).SIRT1 may be also involved in mediating the effects of OMT-28 on mitochondrial biogenesis (91) and inhibition of pro-in ﬂammatory transcription factor NF- kB(92,93).The mechanism of how OMT-28 increasesSIRT1 activity is unclear.
Surprisingly, we found that GW6417 blocked this effect, suggesting the involvement of PPAR a.A s known from previous studies of other authors, enhancedSIRT1 expression is indeed inducible by feno ﬁbrate, a classic PPAR aactivator ( 94). However, we cannot exclude that OMT- 28 physically interacts with SIRT1 and that GW6417 acts as anantagonist at this level of potential short-term activation.Important to sirtuin function is the ratio between NAD +/ NADH, which can be increased or decreased by nutrientsupply, energy consumption and hypoxia impacting mito-chondrial function ( 90,95–101).In general, OMT-28 was superior to 19,20-EDP in attenuating the loss of mitochondrialrespiration stemming from HR injury as re ﬂected in better RCR, NAD +/NADH, and ADP/ATP ratios.A similar trend was observed regarding electron transport chain enzymatic activ- ities and TCA activity, following HR injury.
Our recently published studies indicate that 19,20-EDP protects the heartfrom IR through attenuation of oxidative stress and protectionof mitochondrial function ( 12,18,102). Consistently, both OMT-28 and 19,20-EDP attenuated mitochondrial ROS pro-duction following reoxygenation.Together, the current datasupports a concept where OMT-28 enhances and sustainsoptimal mitochondrial quality following HR injury.Taking 19,20-EDP as an example, we speculate that OMT-28 activates not only SIRT1 but also SIRT3 which deacetylates MnSODand thereby directly reduces O 2−-production in mitochondria (13,102).Rapid post-translational activation of MnSOD would also be in line with our ﬁnding that OMT-28 acutely inhibits O2−-production if added only in the reoxygenation phase.Our current results also demonstrate that OMT-28 improved the post-ischemic functional recovery of isolated perfused mouse hearts subjected to IR injury in a Langendorff apparatus.
This cardioprotective effect involved limitingNLRP3 in ﬂammasome activation associated with caspase-1 activation and subsequent IL-1 bexpression, similarly, as re- ported before with 19,20-EDP ( 12,13). NLRP3 in ﬂammasome activation has been generally known to play a central role inmyocardial IR injury ( 103).Indeed MCC950, a selective NLRP3 in ﬂammasome inhibitor ( 104), was similarly effective as OMT-28 in our IR model.We used heart homogenates for analysis and thus do not know the type of cells in which OMT-28 inhibited in ﬂammasome activation.Major candidates are cardiac ﬁbroblasts that have been identi ﬁed as the primary site of NLRP3 expression and function in IR injury of mouse hearts(105,106).The mechanism of how OMT-28 inhibited IR- induced NLRP3 activation is likely related to the abilities ofOMT-28 to reduce mitochondrial dysfunction and mito- chondrial ROS production ( 107 –109).
Consistent with reduced mitochondrial damage, OMT-28 also prevented IR-induced mitophagic responses. Additionally, OMT-28 atten-uated IR-induced up-regulation of PINK1, parkin, p62, andLC3-II, which are involved in the selective clearance ofdamaged mitochondria ( 60,110).
In conclusion, our results demonstrate the ability of OMT- 28 to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and in ﬂammasome activation, and thus to protect cultured cardiomyocytes and isolated hearts against HR-injury and in ﬂammatory stress.Table 1 Comparison of modes of action for 19,20-EDP and OMT-28 Global effect OMT-28 19,20-EDP Protection against HR-injury + + Protection against LPS-induced endotoxemia++ IR induced in ﬂammasome activation + + ( 12) Mitochondrial function ++ +Mitochondrial ROS production (mitoSOX) −− Inﬂammatory cytokine production and NFkB activation−− − Signaling component involved (inhibitor) PI3K inhibitor (PI-103) Yes NoG alpha i (PTX) Yes Yes PPAR alpha (GW6471) Yes No PPAR gamma (GW9662) No Yes Sirt1 (EX-527) Yes Yes “+”increased, “−“decreased.OMT-28 cardioprotection J.

Experimental procedures Animals All studies were carried out using 2- to 3-month-old male C57/Bl6 mice weighing 25 to 30 g. Mice were maintained in acolony at the University of Alberta and housed under condi-tions of constant temperature and humidity with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle.Mice were fed on a standard rodent chow diet ad libitum (fat 11.3%, ﬁber 4.6%, protein 21% (w/w)).The composition of the diet includes linolenic acid (0.27%), linoleicacid (2.12%), arachidonic acid (0.01%), omega-3 fatty acid(0.45%), total SFA (0.78%), and total MSFA (0.96%) (Pico-LabRodent Diet 20 Cat.No 5053, LabDiets, Inc).All animalexperimental protocols were approved by the University ofAlberta Health Sciences Welfare Committee (University of Alberta Animal Welfare, ACUC, study ID#AUP330) and conducted according to strict guidelines provided by the Guideto the Care and Use of Experimental Animals (Volume.1, 2nded., 1993, from the Canadian Council on Animal Care).

Cells with 80% con- ﬂuency were used to perform experiments, all data using HL- 1 cells were obtained by analyzing responses of three inde-pendent cell preparations and using at least three technicalreplicas. Isolation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 15% horse serum, 5% fetal bovineserum, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin, as previouslydescribed ( 117).Hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) As described previously, HL-1 cardiac cells or NRCMs were exposed to either normoxia or 24 h hypoxia (1% O 2/5% CO 2) followed by 6 h reoxygenation (21% O 2/5% CO 2) using a digitally controlled atmospheric cell culture chamber ( 17).
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model Exposure to environmental stressors can cause mitochon- drial dysfunction leading to irreversible cardiac damage.Exposure to broadly used concentrations of LPS has been welldocumented to be one of the major culprits to damage cardiacmitochondria and promote cardiac dysfunction. HL-1 cardiaccells or NRCMs were exposed to either vehicle or LPS (1 mg/ml) for 6 or 24 h.LPS was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).Subcellular fractionation Following experimental treatment, mouse hearts, HL- 1 cells, and NRCMs were homogenized, and portioned intosubcellular fractions.
Brie ﬂy, samples were ground with a mortar and pestle on dry ice and then homogenized in an ice- Table 2 Inhibitors used to elucidate functional dependencies of OMT-28 and 19,20-EDP Compound name Target Form of inhibition Concentration(s) Catalogue #References for use in cardiac cells EX-527 SIRT1 Selective 10 and 100 nM Sigma E7034 ( 44) GSK3787 PPAR b/d Selective, Irreversible 1 mM Sigma G7423 ( 116) GW6471 PPAR a Selective 1 mM Sigma G5045 ( 115) GW9662 PPAR g Selective, Irreversible 1 mM Sigma M6191 ( 114) HMR-1098 sKATP Selective 10 mM Sigma A8292 ( 84) PI-103 PI3K a Selective 100 nM and 1 mM Cayman 1008208 ( 113) Pertussis Toxin G ai Selective 200 ng/ml Sigma P6659 ( 112) t-AUCB sEH Selective 1 mM Cayman 16568 ( 116) Wortmannin PI3K Non-selective 100 nM Calbiochem 681675 ( 113)OMT-28 cardioprotection 16 J.

(2024) 300(6) 107372 cold homogenization buffer (20 mmol/l Tris-HCL, 50 mmol/l NaCl, 50 mmol/l NaF, 5 mmol/l sodium pyrophosphate,1 mmol/l EDTA and 250 mmol/l sucrose were added on theday of the experiment, pH 7.0). Samples were ﬁrst centrifuged at 800 g,4 /C14C for 10 min to separate cellular debris.The su- pernatant was collected and centrifuged further at 10,000 g,4 /C14C for 20 min.Mitochondrial-enriched fractions were obtained from the resuspension of the resulting pellet in the homoge- nization buffer.Further ultra-centrifugation of the supernatantat 105,000 g,4 /C14C for 60 min yielded the cytosolic fraction.Langendorff isolated hearts Male C57BL/6 mice (2 –3 months old) were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (Euthanyl,100 mg/kg).
Following complete non-responsiveness toexternal stimulation, hearts were quickly excised and perfused in the Langendorff mode with Krebs-Henseleit buffer con- taining (in mM) 120 NaCl, 25 NaHCO 3, 10 Dextrose, 1.75 CaCl 2, 1.2 MgSO 4, 1.2 KH 2PO4, 4.7 KCL, 2 Sodium Pyruvate (pH 7.4) and bubbled with 95% O 2and 5% CO 2at 37/C14C. The left atrium was then excised, and a water- ﬁlled balloon made of saran plastic wrap was inserted into the left ventriclethrough the mitral valve.The balloon was connected to apressure transducer for continuous measurement of LVDP and heart rate (HR).Hearts with persistent arrhythmias were excluded from the experiment.Mouse hearts were perfused inthe retrograde mode at a constant ﬂow rate for 40 min of baseline (stabilization) and then subjected to 30 min of globalno-ﬂow ischemia followed by 40 min of reperfusion.Hearts were perfused with either vehicle (Krebs buffer with 0.1%DMSO), OMT-28 (1 mM), or MCC950 (1 mM; Sigma Aldrich, cat# PZ0280).
In all experiments, chemicals were added 20 min before ischemia and were present in the heart throughout the reperfusion period. The percentage of left ventricular devel-oped pressure (%LVDP) at 40 min of reperfusion (R40), ascompared to baseline LVDP, was taken as a marker for re-covery of contractile function.After 40 min of reperfusion,hearts were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and storedat−80 /C14C.Hemodynamic parameters were acquired and analyzed using ADI software.Cellular analysis Cell viability Cell viability was evaluated using a commercially available cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) (Millipore-Sigma, 96992) assay.Brieﬂy, cellular dehydrogenases on plasma membranes of live cells can oxidize WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4- nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, mono-sodium salt), producing a water-soluble formazan dye whichupon reduction in the presence of an electron carrier, 1-Methoxy PMS, creates formazan.
The amount of formazan,measured spectrophotometrically at 590 nm, positively cor-relates with the number of viable cells. An MTT assay was employed to examine mitochondrial oxidative metabolism as previously described in the assay kit (Abcam, CT02).The intensity of reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to formazan crystals by mitochondrial dehydrogenases positivelycorrelates with overall oxidative metabolic activity ( 118).The optical density of DMSO-extracted formazan was measuredspectrophotometrically at 595 nm.Proteasome activity Total 20S proteasome activity assay was determined in cytosolic fractions monitoring the release of AMC by proteo-lytic cleavage of the peptide Suc-LLVY-AMC (APT280, Chemicon) by 20S proteasomes.The kit measures the for- mation of 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) from thecleavage of substrate LLVY-AMC by the proteasome.Fluo-rescence was monitored at wavelengths of 380 nm (excitation)and 460 nm (emission).
Speci ﬁc activities were determined from a standard curve established with AMC peptide. Aconitase Aconitase enzyme activity was measured in tissue lysates spectrophotometrically (Abcam, ab109712).Aconitase con-verts aconitate to cis-aconitate, which can be detected by in- creases in absorbance (240 nm) in the tissue homogenates.The amount of cis-aconitate formed is proportional to aconitaseactivity.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) ROS production was assessed using a commercially avail- able bioluminescent assay (Promega Corp, ROS-Glo H 2O2 Assay, G8820) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions.Brieﬂy, cells underwent experimental treatments in a 96-well plate.After treatment cells were incubated with an assaydetection solution containing a derivatized luciferin substrate for 20 min and then relative luminescence was assessed.H 2O2 was added as a positive control.
Sirtuin-1 activity assay SIRT1 enzymatic activity was measured in cells following experiments using a SIRT-Glo assay kit (Promega Corp,G6470). Brie ﬂy, cells underwent experimental treatments in a 96-well plate.After treatment cells were incubated with anassay detection solution containing an acetylated luminogenicpeptide substrate to determine deacetylase activity.The assaywas modi ﬁed by incubation for 20 min with the SIRT1-speci ﬁc inhibitor EX-527 (10 mM) before initiation of the reaction.SIRT1-speci ﬁc activity was determined by assessing the dif- ference in deacetylase activity with and without the inhibitor.Caspase-1 activity assay Cleavage of the caspase-1 speci ﬁcﬂuorogenic substrate Ac- YVAD-AMC (Enzo life Sciences, ALX-260-024-M005) wasused to assess functional caspase-1 activity in cytosolic frac-tions of the heart homogenates.
Brie ﬂy, the cytosolic fractions (20–30 mg protein) were incubated with the ﬂuorogenic sub- strate in a reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mM DTT) and theOMT-28 cardioprotection J. Biol.Chem.(2024) 300(6) 107372 17 ﬂuorescence intensity of the cleaved 7-Amino-4- methylcoumarin (AMC) was quantitated kinetically over 1 hat 37 /C14C using a ﬂuorometer (excitation 380 nm, emission 460 nm wavelengths).The activity was calculated by using alinear standard curve created with AMC and normalized to thesample protein concentration.Cytokine and DNA binding activity assays Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify the cardiac cytosolic levels of the cytokine IL-1 b (Abcam, ab100705) according to the manufacturer ’s in- structions.
Brie ﬂy, cytosolic samples (30 –40mg protein) were pipetted into a 96-well plate and incubated for 2.5 h at roomtemperature where IL-1 bpresent in a sample became attached to the wells by the immobilized antibody speci ﬁc for mouse IL- 1bthat is coated on the wells. The wells were then washed and a biotinylated anti-mouse IL-1 bantibody was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking.Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated streptavidin wasadded to the wells after washing away unbound biotinylatedantibodies and incubated for 45 min at room temperature withgentle shaking.A 3,3 0,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) sub- strate solution was then added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark with gentle shaking.Afterwards, the stop solution was pipetted into the wells andthe intensity of the color was measured at 450 nm.
IL-1 b concentration in the different samples was calculated by usinga linear standard curve created with different concentrations ofthe standard IL-1 b. Cell culture medium was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 g, and supernatants were analyzed by ELISA for TNFa (Abcam, ab100747) and MCP-1 levels (Abcam, ab208979).Brie ﬂy, samples were added into individual wells of a 96-well platecoated with a TNFa mouse-speci ﬁc antibody.After washing, wells were incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin,washed, and incubated with substrate solution.The intensityof the color was measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm.Increased color intensity occurred in a linear proportion to the amount of TNFa or MCP-1 in the samples.Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF- b1) was measured in the cell cul- ture supernatants by ELISA kit (Abcam, ab119558).NF-kB DNA binding assays were performed using an ELISA kit (Active Motif), in which nuclear extracts from treated cellswere assessed for DNA binding activity.
Brie ﬂy, cells were gently harvested after 1 h LPS challenge with PBS andcentrifuged for 2 min at 500 g, the supernatant was removed, and the remaining cell pellets were washed with PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of buffer (75 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 250 mM sucrose, 200 mg/ ml digitonin, including protease inhibitors 0.5 mM PMSF,2 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 pg/ml aprotinin and 2.5 mg/ml pep- statin).10% Nonidet P-40 (0.5% ﬁnal) was added to cell sus- pensions, vortexed for 10 s, and centrifuged for 30 s at 30 g.Pellets were incubated on ice for 30 min on a rocker and subsequently centrifuged at 14,000 gfor 10 min at 4/C14C.The supernatant was used as a nuclear extract.PPAR g(ab133101) and PPAR ɑ(ab133107) DNA binding activity were measured in nuclear extracts obtained from cellsfollowing experiments using ELISA kits (Abcam).
Brie ﬂy, the assays were based on the speci ﬁc recognition of af ﬁxed perox- isome proliferator response elements (PPREs) by PPAR gor PPAR ɑtranscription factors contained in cell lysates. Relative levels of binding can then be assessed by the addition of speci ﬁc primary antibodies directed against bound PPAR proteins.Colorimetric readouts at 450 nm were obtained following theaddition of a secondary antibody conjugated to HRP.Mitochondrial function To test overall mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, we measured the ADP/ATP ratio in cell lysates using a luciferase- based method (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK135).Brie ﬂy, ADP and ATP are released from cells following lysis with the kit ’s working reagent.Luciferase and D-luciferin immediately beginreacting with ATP to produce light.The intensity of the lightcorresponds with ATP concentration.Secondly, cellular ADPis later enzymatically converted to ATP.A second intensity oflight can be detected through the same mechanism.
The ratioof these two light intensities represents the ratio of total ADP and ATP within the sample. NAD/NADH ratio in cell lysates was assessed using a bioluminescent kit (Promega, G9071).Brie ﬂy, samples are ﬁrst lysed and then treated with an NADH-dependent reductaseenzyme that reduces proluciferin to luciferin.Luciferin is thenquanti ﬁed by the addition of the Ultra-Glo Recombinant Luciferase as the produced light signal corresponds to theconcentration of luciferin.Mitobiogenesis was evaluated using an ELISA kit (Abcam, ab110217) based on simultaneous detection of succinate de-hydrogenase (SDH-A), a subunit of Complex II (nuclear DNA-encoded protein) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX-1), a subunit of Complex IV (mitochondrial DNA-encodedprotein).The ratio between these proteins (COX-1/SDH-A)reﬂects the intensity of mitobiogenesis.
Mitochondrial respiration was measured in saponin- permeabilized HL-1 cells or NRCM using a Clark oxygen electrode connected to Oxygraph Plus recorder (HansatechInstruments Ltd). Brie ﬂy, following experimental treatment (HR protocol) cells were ﬁrst washed with ice-cold PBS, then gently trypsinized (0.25%) for 5 min, collected, centrifuged toremove trypsin (300 gfor 1 min), resuspended in respiration buffer (20 mM HEPES, 10 mM KH 2PO4, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl 2.6H 2O, 20 mM taurine, 1 g/l BSA, 60 mM potassium-lactobionate, 110 mM mannitol, 0.3 mM dithio- threitol, pH 7.1 adjusted with 5 N KOH) and kept on ice untiladding to oxygraph chamber.Cells were permeabilized directlyin the oxygraph chamber by adding saponin to a ﬁnal con- centration of 10 mg/ml.This allows rapid diffusion of test compounds or inhibitors in the cells.To measure speci ﬁc respiration, respiratory substrates were added to the chamberat different times.
Respiration rates were measured at 30 /C14C before and after the addition of 2 mM ADP in the presence of 5 mM malate and 10 mM glutamate as respiratory substrates,OMT-28 cardioprotection 18 J. Biol.Chem.(2024) 300(6) 107372 normalized to protein concentrations.Respiratory control ra- tio (RCR) was calculated as the ratio between basal and ADP-stimulated respiration rates.Complex I : Malate (5 mM) and glutamate (5 mM).The substrates were prepared as pH neutral, aliquoted, and frozen.The airtight chamber was closed, and respiration was recordedwith a Clark electrode.After 5 to 10 min of baseline recording, malate and glutamate were added directly into the injection port on top of an airtight chamber using a syringe.Next,another 5 to 10 min of recording was obtained and then ADP(2 mM) was added to stimulate ADP-dependent respiration.The kinetic oxygen consumption was recorded for another 5to 10 min.Complex II : Succinate was prepared in neutral pH buffer, aliquoted, and frozen.
The ﬁnal concentration in the chamber was 10 mM. The procedure of oxygen consumption measurement was identical to that described for Complex I.Immunoblotting Immunoblot analysis was conducted as previously described (119).Brie ﬂy, following the resolution of proteins viaelec- trophoresis with (10 –15%) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, they were transferred to polyvinylidene di ﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes (BioRad Laboratories, 1620177) which were then blocked with5% non-fat milk in TBS-T buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM KCl,25 mM tris hydroxymethyl methylamine and 0.1% tween-25,pH 7.4).Membranes were washed three times with TBS-Tbuffer and then incubated overnight at 4 /C14C with primary antibodies.Following secondary washing with TBS-T and in- cubation with horseradish-peroxidase linked anti-rabbit IgGsecondary antibodies, membranes were visualized withchemiluminescence substrates.
Immunoblots were probedwith antibodies against LC3B (1:1000, Cell Signaling Tech-nology, Inc, cat# 3868), Parkin (1:500, Cell Signaling Tech-nology, Inc, cat# 2132), DRP1 (1:500, Cell SignalingTechnology, Inc, cat# 5391), NLRP3 (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, cat# 15101) P62 (1:1000, Abcam, cat# ab56416), PINK1 (1:500, Abcam, cat# ab23707), TXNIP(1:500, MBL International Co, cat# K0205-3), VDAC (1:2000,Abcam, cat# ab14734), AMPK ɑ(1:1000, Cell Signaling Tech- nology, Inc, cat# 25332), p-AMPK ɑ, Thr172 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, cat# 2535), SDH-A (1:1000, CellSignaling Technology, Inc, cat# 5839), COX IV (1:5000, CellSignaling Technology, Inc, cat# 11967), p-AKT (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, cat# 4060), GSK (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, cat# 9315), b-Actin (1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, cat# 4967), and GAPDH (1:2000,Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, cat# 2118, 5174).
Relative bandintensity to control was measured using Image J software. Microscopy Mitochondrial ROS production was assessed in NRCM after being subjected to 24 h hypoxia.Brie ﬂy, NRCM were cultured on glass-bottom 35-mm dishes pre-coated with laminin (1 mg/ml in PBS) for 12 h (suitable for ﬂuorescent microscopy (MatTek Corp, 6-well glass bottom)) at 60 to 70% con ﬂuency and treated with indicated reagents.NRCM were treated withvehicle (culture media with 0.1% Ethanol), OMT-28 (1 mM), or 19,20-EDP(1 mM) either before hypoxia or at the beginning of reoxygenation.The dishes were placed in a micro incubator(37 /C14C, 21% O 2/5% CO 2) installed on the objective stage of the microscope.
Cardiomyocytes were incubated with both a nu-clear (Hoechst 33342 1 mM) and superoxide MitoSOX Red Mitochondrial superoxide indicator (ThermoFischer Scienti ﬁc, M36008) (1 mM) for 10 to 15 min at the beginning of reox- ygenation and imaged at 30 min of reoxygenation using a ZeissAxio Observer Z1 inverted epi ﬂuorescence microscope with 63× oil objective lens and maintained at 37 /C14C throughout the experiment. The image system Zeiss Zen software was used foranalyses.Statistical analysis Values are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean.Statistical signi ﬁcance was determined using one-way ANOVA.Signi ﬁcance was determined with the Bonferroni post hoc test.p-values <0.05 were considered signi ﬁcant.All statistical analyses employed GraphPad Prism Software(Version 5).Data availability All data described are contained within the article.
