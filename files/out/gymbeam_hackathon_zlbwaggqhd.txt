Effect of vitamin B supplementation on cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality A PRISMA-compliant cumulative meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials Sui-Liang Zhang, MDa, Ting-Song Chen, MDb, Chen-Yun Ma, MDc, Yong-Bin Meng, MDd, Yu-Fei Zhang, MDa, Yi-Wei Chen, MDe, Yu-Hao Zhou, MDe,∗ Abstract Background: Observational studies have suggested that vitamin B supplementation is associated with cancer risk, but this association remains controversial.A pooled data-based meta-analysis was conducted to summarize the evidence from randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of vitamin B supplementation on cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality.Methods: PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify trials to ﬁt our analysis through August 2015.
Relative risk (RR) was used to measure the effect of vitamin B supplementation on the risk of cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality using a random-effect model. Cumulative meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, heterogeneity tests, and tests for publication bias were also conducted.Results: Eighteen RCTs reporting the data on 74,498 individuals were included in the meta-analysis.Sixteen of these trials included 4103 cases of cancer; in 6 trials, 731 cancer-related deaths occurred; and in 15 trials, 7046 deaths occurred.Vitamin Bsupplementation had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer (RR: 1.04; 95% con ﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.98 –1.10; P=0.216), death due to cancer (RR, 1.05; 95% CI: 0.90 –1.22; P=0.521), and total mortality (RR, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.94 –1.06; P=0.952).Upon performing a cumulative meta-analysis for cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality, the nonsigni ﬁcance of the effect of vitamin B persisted.
With respect to speci ﬁc types of cancer, vitamin B supplementation signi ﬁcantly reduced the risk of skin melanoma (RR, 0.47; 95% CI: 0.23 –0.94; P=0.032). Conclusion: Vitamin B supplementation does not have an effect on cancer incidence, death due to cancer, or total mortality.It is associated with a lower risk of skin melanoma, but has no effect on other cancers.Abbreviations: CI=conﬁdence interval, ESRD =end-stage renal disease, IS =ischaemic stroke, MI =myocardial infarction, RCT=randomized controlled trials, RR =relative risk.Keywords: cancer, meta-analysis, mortality, vitamin B Editor: Gokhan Cuce.Names for PubMed indexing: S-LZ, T-SC, C-YM, Y-BM, Y-FZ, Y-WC, Y-HZ.Designed research: Y-HZ.Conducted research: S-LZ, Y-FZ, Y-HZ, Y-WC.Provided essential reagents or provided essential materials: Y-HZ.Analyzed data or performed statistical analysis: Y-HZ and Y-WC.Wrote paper: Y-HZ and Y-W C.Had primary responsibility for ﬁnal content: Y-HZ.Revised the paper: T-SC, Y-HZ, C-YM.

Introduction The potential role of vitamin B in relation to the risk of cancer, including breast and colorectal cancer, has been investigated in several observational studies.[1–3]Although the mechanism of action is unclear, vitamin B may affect the incidence of cancer because it is essential for the biosynthesis of nucleotides, replication of DNA, supply of methyl-groups, and the growthand repair of cells.
[4–7]However, observational studies often overestimate the magnitude of the effect and do not prove causality, and the effect of vitamin B supplementation on the risk of cancer has not been con ﬁrmed by randomized controlled trials (RCTs).[8–25]Finally, previous studies have not investigated the potential interaction of supplementation with both vitamin B6 and B12 and its effect on cancer risk.[26,27] The reasons for the discordance between the ﬁndings of RCTs[8–25]and earlier observational studies[1–3]could be as follows: individual trials might have been underpowered to showclinical bene ﬁt, especially if event rates were lower than expected, which always acquired broad con ﬁdence intervals; the duration of follow-up was shorter than that needed to show a clinicalbeneﬁt, or different types of supplements might provide a biased view of the study question; observational studies are hypothesis- generating but cannot prove causality, and always overestimate the magnitude of the effect; and most trials were designed withvascular events as the primary endpoint, and their sample size did not allow adequate power to detect potential clinically relevant differences in cancer incidence.
The effect of vitamin B supplementation on primary and secondary prevention of adverse cardiovascular outcomes has been studied in numerous RCTs. [8–25]With long-term follow-up and collection of cancer data in a majority of studies, insight intothe risk of cancer among participants with vitamin B supplemen- tation and those with placebo can be derived.In this study, a meta-analysis of RCTs was conducted to evaluate the effect ofvitamin B on cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality in speci ﬁc subpopulations, in an attempt to determine the effect of folic supplementation interaction with vitamin B6and B12 on the risk of cancer-related outcomes.In addition, cumulative meta-analyses were employed to determine the evidence base for routine vitamin B supplementation in clinicalpractice.2.Methods 2.1.
Data sources, search strategy, and selection criteria This review and pooled data based meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items forSystematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement, issued in 2009. [28]Ethics approval was not necessary for this study, as only deidenti ﬁed pooled data from individual studies were analyzed.RCTs on vitamin B supplementation, written in the English language, were eligible for inclusion in our study, regardless of the publication status (published, in press, or inprogress), and the effects of vitamin B supplementation on cancer incidence, death due to cancer, total mortality, and any speci ﬁc- type cancer were examined.We systematically searched thePubMed, EmBase, and Cochrane Central Register of ControlledTrials to identify all the trials related to vitamin B supplementa- tion through August 2015.The electronic databases were searched using the following keywords.
“vitamin B ”AND “randomized controlled trials ”AND “clinical trials ”AND “human ”AND “English. ”Furthermore,ongoing trials were identi ﬁed from the metaRegister of Controlled Trials.Finally, manual searches were performedfrom the reference lists within the entire relevant nonrandom- ized controlled trials in order to identify the additional eligible studies.According to a standardized approach, 2 authors carried out literature search, data extraction, and quality assessment independently.The primary author solved any differences untila consensus was achieved if there were any inconsistencies between 2 authors.In order to avoid less confounding variables or biases, we restricted our study design to RCTs rather thanobservational studies.
A study was eligible for inclusion if thefollowing criteria were met: it was an RCT; the trial evaluated the effects of vitamin B supplementation compared with those of placebo or low-dose vitamin B; a follow-up period was of at least1 year; and the trial reported at least 1 outcome as either cancer incidence or death due to cancer. 2.2.Data collection and quality assessment A standard protocol was adopted independently by 2 authors to extract the data from all included trials, and any differentials between these 2 authors were resolved for an agreement though a group discussion.
The collected data include study characteristics(ﬁrst author or study group ’s name, publication year, study design, type of blinding, intervention regimes, controls, and the duration of follow-up.), participants ’characteristics (number of patients, mean age, percentage of men, background forti ﬁcation, current diseases status, baseline total homocysteine level, and baseline folate level), and outcomes variables (cancer incidence, death due to cancer, total mortality, and speci ﬁc-type cancer incidence). Simultaneously, the quality of included trials was evaluated using Jadad score [29]which ranged from 0 to 5, and based on the following items such as randomization, concealmentof the treatment allocation, blinding, completeness of follow-up, and the use of intention-to-treat analysis.In our analysis, we considered a study with a score of 4 or 5 to be of high quality.2.3.
Statistical analysis The results of each RCT were assigned as dichotomous frequency data, and the event numbers were extracted from each trial to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CIs) of each individual trial. The overall RRs with 95% CIs werecalculated for cancer incidence, death due to cancer, total mortality, and speci ﬁc-type cancer in participants who received vitamin B supplementation.The comparison of pooled RRbetween vitamin B supplementation and placebo was performed using ﬁxed-effect and random-effects models respectively, and then the results from the random-effects model were presentedhere.
[30,31]The heterogeneity of the treatment effects among included trials was evaluated using Q statistic; meanwhile, a P value for heterogeneity of less than 0.10 was considered to be statistically signi ﬁcant.[32,33]In the cumulative meta-analysis, outcome data for cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality were shown sequentially in light of the year included in trials which ﬁrst became available. Potential heterogeneity in estimates of the treatment effects was explored using univariate meta-regression.[34]Subgroup analyses were also performed for cancer incidence.The estimates between 2subsets were compared by using interaction tests, which werebased on Student tdistribution rather than on normal distribution as the number of included studies was small.[35]Sensitivity analysesZhang et al.
Medicine (2016) 95:31 Medicine 2 by removing each individual trial from the meta-analysis were also conducted.[36]The publication bias for cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality was statistically assessed using funnelplots, Egger [37]and Begg tests,[38]and Pvalues less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically signi ﬁcant. STATA software (Version 10.0; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) was used toperform the statistical analyses.3.Results The primary electronic search produced 13,334 articles in total.After scanning titles and abstracts, 13,057 irrelevant or duplicate articles were excluded during the initial review.The remaining277 potentially eligible articles were retrieved after detailed evaluations.Finally, 18 RCTs [8–25]were eligible for pooled analysis (Fig.1).Table 1 presents the general characteristics ofthese included trials and baseline information of total 74,498individuals.
Of these, 3 trials [8,12,14]evaluated vitamin B supplementation in patients with chronic renal disease or end- stage renal disease, 7 trials[9–11,15,18 –20]reported patients with cardiovascular disease, 3 trials[13,21,23]evaluated patients with a recent history of colorectal adenomas and no previous invasive large intestine carcinoma, and the remaining 5 trials[16,17,22,24,25] reported participants with cardiovascular risk factors. The number of cases in each included trial ranged from 114 to 20,702 during the follow-up time of 2.0 to 7.3 years, the baselinehomocysteine level ranged from 9.6 to 31.7 mmol/L, the baseline folate level ranged from 8.1 to 35.34nmol/L, and the net change in total homocysteine level ranged from /C02.1 to/C015.1mmol/L.In the intervention groups, the dose of folic acid ranged from 0.4to 40mg per day, that of vitamin B6 from 3.0 to 250mg per day, and that of vitamin B12 from 20 to 2000 mg per day.
The breakdown for the number of trials available for each outcomewas 16, 6, and 15 for cancer incidence, [9–11,13 –25]death due to cancer,[6,8,10,12,16,20]and total mortality,[8–11,13 –21,23,24]respec- tively. The quality of the trials was assessed using the Jadadscore.[29]We considered a score ≥4 to indicate a high-quality study.According to the Jaded scoring method, 6 tri- als[8,9,11,19,20,25]scored 5 points, another 6 trials[10,13 –15,18,24] scored 4 points, 3[16,17,22]scored 3 points, 2[12,21]scored 2 points, and the remaining 1[23]scored 1 point.Figure 1.Flow diagram of the literature search and trials selection process.Table 1 Design and characteristic of trials included in our meta-analysis.SourceNo.

Cumulative meta-analysis of the effect of vitamin B supplementation on the risk of cancer incidence (A), death due to cancer (B), and total mortality ( C).Zhang et al.Medicine (2016) 95:31 Medicine 4 Data from 69,744 participants were used to evaluate the effect of vitamin B supplementation on total mortality and included 7046 death events.There were no signi ﬁcant differences in total mortality between participants receiving vitamin B and thosereceiving placebo (RR, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.94 –1.06; P=0.952; with moderate heterogeneity; Fig.2C).A sensitivity analysis was conducted for total mortality.
However, after sequentialexclusion of each trial, the conclusion was not affected by the exclusion of any speci ﬁc trial. When a cumulative meta-analysis for cancer incidence was carried out, the original nonsigni ﬁcant result for an effect of vitamin B persisted; the effect was slight and borderline nonsigni ﬁcant.Similarly, the nonsigni ﬁcant result persisted when cumulative meta- analysesfordeathdueto cancerandtotalmortalitywereconducted.The effects of vitamin B supplementation on the risk of speci ﬁc types of cancer were also evaluated.Overall, vitamin B supplementation was associated with a signi ﬁcantly reduced risk of skin melanoma (RR, 0.47; 95% CI: 0.23 –0.94; P=0.032; Fig.
3), whereas it had no signi ﬁcant effect on the risk of gastrointestinal cancer (RR, 1.02; 95% CI: 0.87 –1.19; P=0.849), genitourinary cancer (RR, 1.09; 95% CI: 0.88 –1.34; P=0.445), hematological cancer (RR, 1.08; 95% CI: 0.79 –1.49; P=0.625), respiratory and intrathoracic cancer (RR, 1.07; 95% CI: 0.90 –1.27; P=0.470), breast cancer (RR, 0.82; 95% CI: 0.63 –1.07; P=0.149), and other types of cancers (RR, 1.26; 95% CI: 0.99 –1.60; P=0.056). Heterogeneity testing for the analysis showed a P>0.10 for cancer incidence and death due to cancer; no signi ﬁcantFigure 3.Effect of vitamin B supplementation on speci ﬁc-type cancer.Zhang et al.Medicine (2016) 95:31 www.md-journal.com 5 heterogeneity was observed in the overall analysis, which suggests that most variation was attributable to chance alone.However, moderate heterogeneity was observed in the magnitudeof the effect on total mortality across the trials.
Meta-regression analyses were performed [34]for cancer incidence that included the mean age, baseline homocysteine level, baseline folate level,dose of folic acid, dose of vitamin B6, dose of vitamin B12, and duration of follow-up. The results indicated that these variables were not signi ﬁcant factors contributing to the association between vitamin B supplementation and cancer incidence (datanot shown).Subgroup analyses were conducted for cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality to minimize heterogeneity and explore the effect of vitamin B supplementation in any speci ﬁc subpopulations.Vitamin B supplementation might play an important role in cancer incidence if the mean age of the participants is <62 years (RR, 1.15; 95% CI: 0.99 –1.34; P= 0.074; Fig.4), and baseline homocysteine levels are <14mmol/L (RR, 1.07; 95% CI: 0.99 –1.14; P=0.075; Fig.4), although these results were not statistically signi ﬁcant.
When subgroup analyses based on other factors were carried out, no signi ﬁcant differences were observed between vitamin B supplementation and placebo.Figure 4. Subgroup analysis for cancer incidence.Zhang et al.Medicine (2016) 95:31 Medicine 6 Furthermore, there was no signi ﬁcant difference in the effect of vitamin B supplementation between the 2 subgroups with respect to cancer incidence.Finally, similar nonsigni ﬁcant results were detected for death due to cancer and total mortality (data notshown).A review of funnel plots did not rule out the potential for publication bias for cancer incidence.The Egger [37]and Begg tests,[38]however, showed no evidence of publication bias for cancer incidence ( Pvalue for Egger: 0.183; Pvalue for Begg: 0.893; Fig.5).4.Discussion Previous observational studies[39–46]have suggested that vitamin B supplementation has a marked effect on cancer incidence.However, observational studies may overestimate the effect of vitamin B supplementation.
So far, the effect of vitamin Bsupplementation on the risk of cancer has not been con ﬁrmed by any RCT. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of RCTs to quantitatively assess the effect of vitamin B supplementation on the risk of cancer-related outcomes, and the ﬁndings of our study, which has a large sample size, are potentially more robust than those of any individual trial.In this study, RCTs were included to explore all possible correlations between vitamin B supplemen-tation and the outcomes of cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality.This comprehensive, large-scale, quantitative study included 74,498 individuals from 18 trials with a broadrange of baseline characteristics.The ﬁndings of our study indicated that vitamin B supplementation has no signi ﬁcant effect on cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality.
Considering speci ﬁc cancer types, vitamin B signi ﬁcantly reduced the risk of skin melanoma, but did not have any signi ﬁcant effect on other types of cancers. In a cumulative meta-analysis, the effect of vitamin B on cancer incidence, death due to cancer, andtotal mortality persisted and remained nonsigni ﬁcant.Several meta-analyses have evaluated the impact of vitamin B supplementation on the risk of cancer-related outcomes.[26,27,47 –54] For meta-analysis based on observational studies, folic acid supplementation was associated with a lower risk of oral and pharyngeal,[47]breast,[48]bladder,[49]esophageal and pancreatic cancer.[50]Furthermore, dietary folic acid supplementation was not associated with the risk of colorectal,[51]prostate,[52]lung,[53]andgastric cancer.[50]In addition, Zhang et al[53]suggested that folic acid supplementation might affect subsequent lung cancer risk inmen.
Tio et al [52]indicated that high blood folate level was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. However, the hypothesized effect of vitamin B supplementation comes frommeta-analyses of observational studies, which may overestimate its effect on the incidence of speci ﬁc types of cancer.Three important systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs have evaluated theimpact of folic acid supplementation on cancer incidence and have found no evidence to support a signi ﬁcant effect.[26,27,54]Clarke et al[26]performed a meta-analysis of 8 RCTs involving 37,485 individuals and found that vitamin B supplementation had nosigniﬁcant effect on cancer incidence (RR, 1.05; 95% CI: 0.98 –1.13), cancer mortality (RR, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.85 –1.18), and total mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI: 0.97 –1.08) during the whole scheduled treatment period or in the subsequent years.
Vollset et al [27]suggested that folic acid supplementation was associated with higher plasma concentrations of folic acid, but hadno signi ﬁcant effect on cancer incidence. For speci ﬁct y p e so f cancers, there was no signi ﬁcant difference between vitamin B and placebo for cancer at any speci ﬁcs i t e s .Q i ne ta l [54]indicated that while folic acid supplementation had no signi ﬁcant effect on total cancer incidence, and the incidence of colorectal, prostate, lung, breast, and hematological malignancy cancers, it signi ﬁcantly reduced the risk of melanoma.In the present study, all pooled RRestimate points for cancer incidence were >1 (evidence accumulat- ed up to 2006) with a potential trend toward moving rightward in the cumulative meta-analysis of vitamin B supplementation.Apotentially harmful effect of vitamin B on total cancer incidence was detected, but this trend was nonsigni ﬁcant and requires validation.
For death due to cancer and total mortality, the nonsigni ﬁcant effects persisted and remained. There was no signi ﬁcant difference between vitamin B supplementation and placebo in terms of the effect on therelative risks of cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and totalmortality.Cumulative ﬁndings of out meta-analysis indicated, with evidence accumulated up to 2006, that the pooled RR estimate points for cancer incidence were >1.A study conducted by Ulrich and Potter [55]indicated that folic acid may have inﬂuenced growth in cancers that were silent at baseline or during trials, leading to excess subsequent clinical surfacing anddiagnosis during extended follow-up.Furthermore, evidence suggests that aggressive supplementation may enhance the growth of established, microscopic lesions.
[56]Data on the incidence of speci ﬁc types of cancer were available in our study; however, no signi ﬁcant difference was detected between vitamin B supplementation and placebo, except in the case of skinmelanoma. These results may be attributed to chance, because asmall number of trials [10,16,20]were included.Subgroup analyses were conducted for cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality.No signi ﬁcant effect on cancer incidence was observed in subpopulations with a mean age less than 62 years and those with a baseline homocysteine level >14m mol/L; the effect seemed to be slight, but nonsigni ﬁcant.In the current study, mean age and baseline homocysteine levels in participants were available for whole populations; individual data were not available, which prevented us from performingmore comprehensive analyses.Furthermore, participants with different backgrounds and intervention regimens might contrib- ute to the biased treatment effect.
Finally, nearly all included trialsincluded participants from the Western countries except 1 trial,which speci ﬁcally included Chinese people. [24]Theﬁndings of CSPPT were consistent with those of trials conducted in WesternFigure 5.Funnel plot for cancer incidence.Zhang et al.Medicine (2016) 95:31 www.md-journal.com 7 countries.Furthermore, alimentation habits might play an important role in the risk of cancer;[24]however, data about alimentation status were not available to us.Therefore, we just performed a relative comprehensive review to evaluate the effect of vitamin B on the risk of cancer, death due to cancer, and totalmortality.The present meta-analysis has certain limitations.First, different types and doses of vitamin B supplements wereincluded, which could bias the results.Second, the background among participants taking vitamin B might have impaired our ability to identify the treatment effect.
Third, the different resultsof cancer surveillance and reporting may lead to variousincidences of cancer among trials. Fourth, patients who have had background therapy for previous diseases were not available in strati ﬁed analyses.Fifth, several included trials with low Jadad score, which hampered the quality of our work.Finally, more detailed relevant analysis could be restricted by conducting analysis using pooled data instead of individual data.In conclusion, vitamin B supplementation has no signi ﬁcant effect on cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality.Subgroup analyses suggested that vitamin B mighthave a detrimental effect on cancer incidence when the mean age of the participants was less than 62 years and baseline homocysteine levels were >14mmol/L.In addition, vitamin B supplementation signi ﬁcantly reduced the risk of skin melanoma.Future trials should focus on speci ﬁc younger subpopulations and participants with baseline homocysteine level >14mmol/L.
We suggest that ongoing trials should be improved in the followingways: total cancer incidence, and death due to cancer or any speci ﬁc type of cancer should be recorded and reported normatively, and it should be evaluated in future trials, andthe role of intervention duration and dosage of supplementation should be taken into consideration before evaluating clinical outcomes.
