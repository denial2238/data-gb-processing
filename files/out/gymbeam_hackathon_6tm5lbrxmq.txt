RESEARCH ARTICLE Utilisation of supplemented L-carnitine for fuel efficiency, as an antioxidant, and for muscle recovery in Labrador retrievers Jessica L.Varney1, J.W.Fowler1, W.C.Gilbert2and C.N.Coon1* 1Four Rivers Kennel LLC, Walker, MO 64790, USA 2Threshold Enterprises, Scotts Valley, CA 95066, USA (Received 9 June 2016 –Final revision received 1 October 2016 –Accepted 5 January 2017) Journal of Nutritional Science (2017), vol.6, e8, page 1 of 9 doi:10.1017/jns.2017.4 Abstract The primary goal was to investigate the effects of L-carnitine on fuel ef ﬁciency, as an antioxidant, and for muscle recovery in Labrador retrievers.Dogs were split into two groups, with one group being supplemented with 250 mg/d of Carniking ™L-carnitine powder.Two experiments (Expt 1 and Expt 2) were performed over a 2-year period which included running programmes, activity monitoring, body composition scans and evaluation of recovery using bio - markers.
Each experiment differed slightly in dog number and design: ﬁfty-six v. forty dogs; one endurance and two sprint runs per week v.two endurance runs; and differing blood collection time points.All dogs were fed a low-carnitine diet in which a ﬁxed amount was offered based on maintaining the minimum starting weight.Results from Expt 1 found that the carnitine dogs produced approximately 4000 more activity points per km comparedwith the control group during sprint ( P=0·052) and endurance runs ( P=0·0001).Male carnitine dogs produced half the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) following exercise compared with male control dogs ( P=0·05).Carnitine dogs had lower myoglobin at 6 ·69 ng/ml following intensive exercise compared with controls at 24 ·02 ng/ml ( P=0·0295).Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) results were not considered signi ﬁcant.
In Expt 2, body composition scans indicated that the carnitine group gained more total tissue mass while controls lost tissue mass ( P=0·0006) and also gained lean mass while the control group lost lean mass ( P<0·0001). Carnitine dogs had lower CPK secretion at 23 ·06v.control at 28 ·37 mU/ml 24 h after post-run ( P=0·003).Myoglobin levels were lower in carnitine v.control dogs both 1 h post-run ( P=0·0157; 23 ·83 v.3 7·91 ng/ml) and 24 h post-run ( P=0·0189; 6 ·25v.13·5 ng/ml).TAC indicated more antioxidant activity in carnitine dogs at 0 ·16 m Mv.control at 0·13 m M(P=0·0496).TBARS were also signi ﬁcantly lower in carnitine dogs both pre-run ( P=0·0013; 15 ·36v.2 3·42 µ M) and 1 h post-run ( P= 0·056; 16 ·45v.2 0·65 µ M).Supplementing L-carnitine in the form of Carniking ™had positive bene ﬁts in Labrador retrievers for activity intensity, body composition, muscle recovery and oxidative capacity.
Key words: L-Carnitine: Canine performance: Dog nutrition: Muscle recovery: Antioxidants: Fuel ef ﬁciency: Labrador retrievers L-Carnitine is a conditionally essential nutrient that has been shown to have many uses and bene ﬁts for the overall health in people and animals. L-Carnitine is essential for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria(1)and has been shown to be necessary for normal cardiac and skeletal musclefunction (2).
Although L-carnitine is able to be synthesised in the hepatic and renal systems of humans and dogs(3), this is not possible within cardiac or skeletal muscle and thusL-carnitine is either absorbed from the diet or biosynthesised by other tissues(4).L-Carnitine supplementation has gained popularity in both human athletic performance and the com- panion animal industry in recent years, although few studies have been performed on performance and recovery in canines.It has been suggested that although the vitamins and minerals in commercial diets should be suf ﬁcient for less active dogs, they may need to be altered in active canines (5).

Greyhounds, however, primarily have fast-twitch muscle ﬁbres while other breeds have primarily slow-twitch muscle ﬁbres, and so the effect of supplemented L-carnitine may vary between breeds(5).Most L-carnitine studies have been performed using human subjects, particularly human athletes, although results have been somewhat con ﬂicting.
A double-blind placebo-controlled human study performed on elite athletes found bene ﬁcial effects during chronic L-carnitine supplementation on lipid metabolism, evoked muscular potential, VO 2max, behaviour and biological output. Bene ﬁcial effects on physical output, lipid metabolism, muscular function, post-exercise lactate, and urine mucoproteins were also found during acute supple- mentation(7).A single-blind study using six human subjects found that L-carnitine supplementation reduced pain and delayed the onset of muscle soreness following eccentric exer- cise, based on creatine phosphokinase (CPK) assay results andsubjective muscle soreness grading (8).Alternatively, a study comparing L-carnitine ’s effects on trained human swimmers found no difference on swimming time, swim velocity or post-exercise lactate (9).
Broad et al.(10)found no bene ﬁt on human cycling performance but rather that L-carnitine supplementa- tion tended to reduce mobilisation and/or oxidation of fattyacids. The present study was developed based on the promis- ing work performed in human subjects and the need for con- tinued work in the canine-speci ﬁc response to L-carnitine in performance and recovery aspects.During the course of two experiments, L-carnitine ’s effects on food intake, body weight, body composition and activity outputduring exercise were evaluated.Recovery aspects such as heart rate, body temperature and blood biomarkers before and after were examined.CPK and myoglobin were selected as biomarkersof muscle damage based on the secretion of these enzymes after strenuous exercise (11).Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and thio- barbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were selected as bio-markers of oxidative stress (11,12).
Based on previous studies, it was hypothesised that L-carnitine could have bene ﬁcial perform- ance and recovery effects for Labrador retrievers during and fol-lowing a strenuous exercise regimen. Materials and methods All procedures were reviewed and approved by theInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee at FourRivers Kennel, LLC under protocol FRK-04.Animals and housing A group of forty Labrador retrievers (twenty male/twentyfemale) ranging from 1 to 4 years of age were utilised in experi- ment 1.A group of ﬁfty-six Labrador retrievers (twenty-eight male/twenty-eight female) ranging from 1 to 4 years of agewere utilised in experiment 2.Sex and colour by group for both experiments are displayed in Table 1 .All dogs were allowed free access to outside airing yards for 4 to 6 h daily,weather permitting, and were housed in individual kennels overnight.All dogs had unrestricted access to automatic water- ers.
Dogs were fed once daily in the morning as per their treat-ment requirements. Diets A low- L-carnitine basal diet was formulated for all dogs in both experiments formulated by Dr George Collings (Collings Nutrition Solutions) and prepared with extrusion equipment at Kansas State University (Manhattan, KS, USA)(Table 2 ).The same diet formulation from different manufac- turing dates was fed during both experiments and the nutrient content of each diet was determined before the start of each study.The quantity of food provided to each dog on a daily basis was set and adjusted based on maintaining a minimuminitial starting body weight throughout the study.Feed con- sumption was determined daily by weighing feed provided and feed refusals.For each experiment, the metabolisable energy (ME) for the low- L-carnitine basal diet was determined using the indicator method(13).
Diet samples and faecal samples from six dogs were collected after each experiment and analysed for crude protein and gross energy using bomb calorimetry (University of Arkansas Central Analytical Laboratory, Fayetteville, AR,USA). L-Carnitine levels in test foods for both experiments were tested using a radioisotopic enzymatic method (Metabolic Analysis Labs, Madison, WI, USA)(14).The basal L-carnitine levels were slightly higher at 19 ·3% ( 0 ·048 mg/ kcal ME; 0 ·011 mg/kJ ME) in the diet fed for experiment 2 compared with 14 ·9% ( 0 ·037 mg/kcal ME; 0 ·009 mg/kJ ME) in the diet fed for experiment 1 The gross energy (kJ/ g) was slightly higher in experiment 1 compared with experi- ment 2 but the ME was approximately the same ( Table 2 ).Added supplements For both experiments, each dog in the carnitine group was supplemented each day with 3 ·75 g sugar and 250 mg Carniking ™brand ( L-carnitine powder provided by Lonza Table 1.

L-Carnitine supplement absorption is primarily passive in mammals and bioavailability of the dose is typically 14 –18 %(15).The control group was supplemented with 4 g sugar.All dogs received the same amount of supplements regardless of weight, although the total intake of L-carnitine was depend- ent upon food intake ( Table 3 ).Supplements were added to 200 g of food for each dog and fed ﬁrst, to ensure all dogs were consuming the full amount of L-carnitine and sugar.After the dog had consumed the ﬁrst 200 g and supplements, they were then given the rest of their meal.Experimental design Experiment 1.
Experiment 1 took place over 14 weeks. A total of forty Labrador retrievers were split into two dietary treatment groups, carnitine and control, with groupsequalised between sex, body weight, genetics and body composition.The control group was supplemented with 4 g sugar and the carnitine group was supplemented with 3 ·75 g sugar and 250 mg Carniking ™brand L-carnitine powder.Dogs were fed a low-carnitine diet in which amounts were determined based on maintaining a minimum initial startingbody weight.All feed offered and feed refusals were weighed to measure consumption.All dogs began a running exercise programme immediately after a baseline blood drawand body composition scan that included two short sprint runs ranging from 1 ·1t o2 ·2 km and one long endurance run ranging from 8 ·8t o1 6 ·1 km per week, until the ﬁnal week where the dogs completed a ﬁnal long endurance run of 24 ·2 km.
All dogs wore global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer collars during the running portion of thestudies to quantify the distance ran and their activity output. Additional blood samples were collected from each dogTable 2.

A total of ﬁfty-six Labrador retrievers were split into two dietary treatment groups that were equalised between sex,genetics and body composition. Of the dogs that were used in experiment 1, thirty-six went on to participate in experiment 2, and the treatment groups for those dogs wereswitched.The control group was supplemented with 4 g sugar and the carnitine group was supplemented with 3 ·75 g sugar and 250 mg Carniking ™brand L-carnitine powder.All dogs were fed a low-carnitine diet in which amounts were determined based on maintaining a minimum initial starting body weight.Feed offered and feed refusals were weighed tomeasure consumption.A baseline blood sample was collected, as well as the initial body composition scan, the day before beginning the running exercise programme.Theexercise regimen included two long endurance runs per week ranging from 8 ·8t o1 6 ·1 km, ending with a ﬁnal long run of 24·2 km.Dogs wore accelerometer and GPS collars during all runs.
All dogs were scanned after the ﬁnal long run for body composition and had blood samples collected the day before the ﬁnal long run, 1 h after the ﬁnal long run, and 24 h after the ﬁnal long run. All dogs were weighed at the beginning of the study and weighed every week throughout the study.Performance and running regimen Experiment 1.All dogs completed a running programme for the duration of the experiment.Dogs wore an accelerometer collar (Actical®; Philips Respironics) to determine activity points per km (APKm) while running.All dogs ran shortsprint runs twice per week, and a long endurance run once per week.The sprint running regimen was designed to simulate an American Kennel Club hunt test: the dogs ranmultiple 100 m retrieves.The short sprints started at 1 ·1k m each session (multiples of 100 m retrieves), increasing incrementally for 10 weeks to 2 ·2 km and then tapering down until the ﬁnal long endurance run in week 13.
The long endurance runs started at 8 ·8 km, increasing incrementally for 10 weeks until dogs ran 16 ·1 km and then tapering down until the ﬁnal 24 ·2 km long run. Dogs ran alongside an all-terrain vehicle and were free to run at their own pace, swim, play, etc.but met at least the minimumdistance required.Experiment 2.All dogs completed a running programme during the experiment.Dogs wore an accelerometer collar (Actical®; Philips Respironics) while running.For ef ﬁciency and for the prevention of heat-related injuries in the warm weather during experiment 2, retrieving sprints were notperformed.Endurance running was preferable in hot weather as the dogs were able to swim and cool off at will.One of the runs each week included 100 m fartleks (periods of fast running intermixed with periods of slower running).The long runs started at 8 ·8 km, increasing incrementally for 10 weeks until 16 ·1 km and then tapering down until the ﬁnal 24 ·2 km long run.
Dogs ran alongside an all-terrain vehicle and were free to run, swim, play, etc. but met atleast the minimum distance required.Body composition All dogs were scanned using a GE Lunar dual-energy X-rayabsorptiometry (DXA) (General Electric Company) machinefor body composition before beginning each study to establish baseline, and after the ﬁnal long run to view any changes.Dogs were anaesthetised for the scans using dexmedetomidine(Dexdormitor ®; Zoetis Inc.), torbutrol (Zoetis Inc.) and atro- pine (Vedco Inc.).Dogs were positioned dorsoventrally for the scans and were closely monitored post-recovery.Blood collection and biomarker assays All blood samples were collected from the dogs via the ceph- alic vein into EDTA vacutainers (Becton, Dickinson and Company).The baseline blood draw was performed beforebeginning any feeding, exercise, or supplementing regimen in a 24 h fasted state for both experiments.
The pre-run blood draw was performed the day before the ﬁnal long run, approximately 2 h after being fed 200 g of feed and designated supplements, for both experiments. The 1 h post-run blood draw was performed 1 h after the ﬁnal long run, and approxi- mately 3 h after being fed 200 g of feed and designated supple- ments, for both experiments.In experiment 2, a 24 h post-run blood draw was performed 24 h after the ﬁnal long run and fed 200 g of feed and designated supplements approximately 2 h prior.All animals were monitored for signs of stress during blood collection procedures.Blood samples were centrifuged according to assay kit instructions to collect blood serum.Serum was immediately frozen at −80°C until further use.Serum was evaluated for muscle protein excretion using CPK (Biovision Inc.) and myo- globin (Innovative Research Inc.) assay kits.Oxidative status was evaluated using TAC (Cayman Chemical Company) andTBARS (Cayman Chemical Company) assay kits.
All samples were run in duplicate. Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.) was used to compare the effect of treatment groups on run time, food intake, body composition, body weight and changes in blood chemistry using an unpaired ttest.JMP 10.0.2 (SAS Institute, Inc.) was used to create mixed, one-way and regres- sion models for statistical analyses of the effect of treatment group on activity during endurance runs, experiment compar-isons, food consumption aspects, body composition and blood chemistry.Experiment 1 and experiment 2 were 4journals.cambridge.org/jns analysed separately.Sex was analysed as a ﬁxed effect based on the potential variance between male and female dogs.Resultswere considered signi ﬁcant if a Pvalue of 0 ·05 or less was obtained.Results Feed intake Experiment 1.Dogs in experiment 1 consumed an average of 651 g of feed per d.No signi ﬁcant difference was found overall between treatment groups ( P=0·1291; carnitine 626 (SEM24)v.
control 677 ( SEM23) g). Experiment 2.Dogs in experiment 2 consumed an average of 536 g of feed per d.Carnitine dogs consumedsigniﬁcantly more weight of feed overall compared with the control group ( P<0·0001; 574 ( SEM8·08)v.540 ( SEM8·08) g).Performance Experiment 1.The carnitine group produced approximately 4000 more APKm overall during both the short sprint runs(P=0·052) and the long runs ( P=0·0001) over 14 weeks compared with the control group ( Table 4 ).The female carnitine group produced very intense activity overall at 56354 APKm compared with the male carnitine group at 45 987 APKm, male control group at 46 099 APKm, and female control group at 47 780 APKm ( P=0·0009).Experiment 2.No signi ﬁcant differences were found in APKm between the carnitine and control groups for all long endurance runs ( P=0·1754; 45 530 ( SEM853) v.47 344 ( SEM 1030) APKm) ( Table 5 ).Body composition Experiment 1.
A signi ﬁcant increase in total body mass was observed from before the beginning of the study until the end for all dogs in both groups ( P<0·0001; 27 ·0(SEM0·2502) v. 25·33 ( SEM0·2502) kg).No signi ﬁcant differences in body composition were found between treatment groups (data not shown).Experiment 2.Many more signi ﬁcant changes in body composition were noted in experiment 2.The carnitine group gained 0 ·74 kg total tissue mass while the control group lost 0·12 kg tissue mass ( P=0·0006).The carnitine group gained 0·68 kg lean mass (LM) while the control group lost 0 ·41 kg LM ( P<0·0001).From baseline to after the ﬁnal long run, the female carnitine dogs had a change of 0 ·45 kg LM while the female control dogs lost 0 ·8k g L M ( P=0·0006).Male carnitine dogs also gained 0 ·91 kg LM compared with only 0·09 kg gain in control males ( P=0·0050) ( Table 6 ).Recovery and oxidative status Experiment 1.
CPK assay results showed male carnitine dogs experienced a lower increase in enzyme secretion with a change of 5 ·54 mU/ml v. control male dogs at an increase of 12 ·94 mU/ml from before to after the ﬁnal run (P=0·05).Myoglobin assay results also showed that carnitine dogs had lower concentrations during the ﬁnal long run ( P=0·0295; 6 ·69 ( SEM2·7)v.2 4·02 ( SEM6·59) ng/ml) (Table 7 ).Experiment 2.CPK results showed that carnitine dogs experienced signi ﬁcantly lower concentrations 24 h following theﬁnal long run at 23 ·06 mU/ml compared with the control group at 28 ·37 mU/ml ( P=0·003).Carnitine dogs had signi ﬁcantly lower myoglobin leakage compared with the control group both 1 h post-run ( P=0·0157; 23 ·83 ( SEM 3·02)v.3 7·91 ( SEM4·77) ng/ml) and 24 h post-run ( P= 0·0189; 6 ·25 ( SEM1·47)v.13·5(SEM2·61) ng/ml) ( Table 8 ).The female and male responses to L-carnitine both showed decreased levels of CPK and myoglobin compared with control.
Female carnitine dogs had signi ﬁcantly lower myoglobin levels at 1 h post-run ( P=0·0491; 25 ·19 ( SEM 4·25) v.4 3·94 ( SEM 8·03) ng/ml) while the males had a response at 24 h post-run ( P=0·0214; 24 ·4(SEM1·53)v. 29·7(SEM1·53) ng/ml) ( Figs 1 and2).Carnitine dogs had signi ﬁcantly more TAC compared with control dogs 24 h post-run ( P=0·0496; 0 ·16 ( SEM0·01)v.0·13 ( SEM 0·01) m M)(Table 6 ).TBARS were signi ﬁcantly lower in carnitine dogs both before the ﬁnal long run ( P= 0·0013; 15 ·36 ( SEM1·55)v.2 3·42 ( SEM1·8) µ M) and 1 h after the long run ( P=0·056; 16 ·45 ( SEM 1·43) v.2 0·65 ( SEM 1·61) µ M)(Table 6 ).The females had a stronger response to L-carnitine.TAC levels were higher in carnitine dogs at 0 ·16 mMthan control at 0 ·10 m M24 h post-run ( P=0·0016).TBARS were signi ﬁcantly lower both pre-run ( P=0·0013;Table 4.

Males did not have a positive response to L-carnitine in TAC levels, and TBARS levels were signi ﬁcantly lower in carnitine dogs only at the pre-run interval ( P=0·0104; 14 ·03 ( SEM2·24)v.2 3·64 (SEM2·66) µ M)(Figs 1 and2). Discussion For the purpose of both experiments, APKm were obtained via accelerometers on each dog.Given that the dogs were free to run at their own pace for the prescribed distance, theactivity points quantify the intensity of the exercise (16).F o r instance, dogs frequently stopping or moving at a slow pacewill have lower APKm v.dogs moving at a fast trot or run that will have higher APKm.Results from experiment 1showed the carnitine dogs having a higher average APKm, but there were no signi ﬁcant outcomes for activity in experi- ment 2.Several factors could have affected this, such as thedogs in experiment 1 performing sprint running each week as well as the endurance exercise, or experiment 1 being per- formed during cooler months compared with experiment2.
Few other studies have been performed on L-carnitine ’s effect on exercise intensity; however, a study has been per- formed on the effect of L-carnitine on skeletal muscle force in canines. Dubelaar et al.(17)found a 34 % increase in muscle force in the latissimus dorsi of dogs supplemented with L-carnitine.Alternatively, Trappe et al.(9)comparedTable 7.

6journals.cambridge.org/jns L-carnitine ’s effects on velocity and time of high-intensity swimming in humans but did not ﬁnd any signi ﬁcant effect on swimming time and velocity. This was attributed to thefact that the subjects used had been involved in swim training for at least 16 weeks and were at the capacity of their physio- logical limits.This may also be the case for the present study asthe dogs were regularly exercised before beginning each experi- ment, and performed running exercise every week for the 14 weeks of each experiment.Results of the body composition analysis in the present study showed no signi ﬁcant differences in experiment 1, but several signi ﬁcant differences in total tissue mass and LM in experiment 2.An explanation for the difference in results for each experiment may be due to the diet consumed during experiment 1 having higher intake than the diet consumed inexperiment 2.
Therefore, the dogs in experiment 1 did have a higher energy intake and should have had a reduced amount of food offered. The higher energy intake may have prevented L-carnitine ’s effects of decreasing fat and increasing LM.Experiment 1 was similar to a study in which human subjectsunderwent body composition scans before and after low- intensity cycling exercise during a 12-week period.Subjects in both L-carnitine and control groups were both overfed car- bohydrates.The control group had an increase in total tissue mass solely due to an increase in total body fat, but the carni- tine group did not have any increase in total tissue mass, totalbody fat or total LM(18).In experiment 2 of the present study, the carnitine dogs consumed signi ﬁcantly more weight of food on average compared with the control dogs and were able togain LM while the control dogs lost LM at the end of the run- ning programme.The discrepancy between the present study and the Stephens et al.
(18)study may be the type of exercise performed, where the low-intensity cycling was not strenuous enough to induce a change in LM as observed in the present study 13-week running programme. The increased LM in theLabrador retrievers in experiment 2 may help prevent an increase in fat deposition, which is important for many life stages of dogs.Maintaining lean body mass in growing puppiescan help prevent future obesity, as well as prevent the possible loss of LM as the dog ages (19).L-Carnitine may prevent the loss of LM during increased activity and weight reduction, which isimportant for the long-term maintenance of optimum body condition (20).The ﬁndings in the present studies indicate a signi ﬁcant advantage for L-carnitine-supplemented dogs in preventing the loss of proteins that are indicative of muscle in ﬂammation during strenuous exercise.
Experiment 2 ’s CPK assay results show that the carnitine group ’s CPK levels were signi ﬁcantly lower than the control group at 24 h post-run. The carnitinegroup ’s CPK levels were falling at this point while the control group ’s levels continued to rise.Parandak et al.(21)examined human subjects ’performance during aerobic exercise via Fig.1.Female effect of L-carnitine in recovery biomarkers: (a) creatine kinase, (b) myoglobin, (c) total antioxidant capacity (TAC), (d) thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)., Carnitine; , control.Values are means with standard errors represented by vertical bars.* Mean value was significantly different for car- nitine compared with control ( P<0·05).7journals.cambridge.org/jns running, similar to the present study ’s exercise regimen with dogs, and found that L-carnitine supplementation resulted in lower CPK levels compared with control at the post-24 h exer-cise interval.Ho et al.
(22)also found both a signi ﬁcant reduction in CPK and myoglobin secretion in L-carnitine-supplemented subjects v. control during squat/leg press exercises.Volek et al.(23)found a reduction in myoglobin release into the blood following squat-type exercise in subjects supplemented with L-carnitine.Volek et al.(23)were unable to generate a CPK response to L-carnitine, although this was attributed to either a slow CPK response time or the inability to generate disruption to the sarcolemma due to type or intensity of exer-cise.Strenuous exercise causes disruption to the permeability of the sarcolemma, allowing proteins and enzymes such as CPK and myoglobin into the bloodstream.The time pointsat which a signi ﬁcant difference is noted between carnitine and control groups seems to vary slightly between species, sex and type of exercise performed but this evidence fully sup-ports L-carnitine ’s bene ﬁt in exercise recovery.
Future studies on the dose response in canines to supplemented L-carnitine may be necessary, as the effects seem to vary dependent onanimal variables. In experiment 2, the carnitine group experienced a steady increase in TAC values at each time interval when comparedwith the control group, which experienced a signi ﬁcant decrease in TAC at the post-24 h time interval.The presentstudy shows that the control dogs had lost TAC well below baseline 24 h post-run while the carnitine dogs were able to maintain TAC at just under baseline.TBARS results werelower in carnitine dogs both before and after the ﬁnal long run, indicating a much lower rate of lipid peroxidation taking place not only during the oxidative stress of the ﬁnal long run, but during normal daily activity as well.Females had an overall stronger response to L-carnitine and a signi ﬁcantly lower aver- age body weight, indicating that a higher dosage of L-carnitine may be necessary to aid the males ’oxidative status.
Parandak et al.(21)examined L-carnitine ’s effects on oxidative stress via TAC and TBARS in human subjects after runningexercise and found similar results; TAC was higher and TBARS were lower in L-carnitine-supplemented subjects 24 h post-run. During strenuous exercise, reactive oxygen species(free radicals) are produced due to increased oxygen consump- tion and anaerobic conditions in the muscle tissue (24).L-Carnitine supports more ef ﬁcient use of oxygen and energy in muscle tissue, thereby minimising the loss of oxygen and keeping the tissue more aerobic(25).Conclusion Supplementation of L-carnitine had positive impacts on the performance and recovery of Labrador retrievers in both experiments.Findings from the studies performed indicated Fig.2.Male effect of L-carnitine in recovery biomarkers: (a) creatine kinase, (b) myoglobin, (c) total antioxidant capacity (TAC), (d) thiobarbituric acid reactive sub - stances (TBARS)., Carnitine; , control.
