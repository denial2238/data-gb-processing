To evaluate whether daily oral vitamin B-12 supplementation during pregnancy increases maternal and infant measures of vitamin B-12 status, we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
Pregnant women <14 wk of gestation in Bangalore, India, were randomly assigned to receive daily oral supplementation with vitamin B-12 (50 mg) or placebo through 6 wk postpartum. All women were administered iron and folic acid supplements throughout pregnancy.One hundred eighty-three women were randomly assigned to receive vitamin B-12 and 183 to receive placebo.Compared with placebo recipients, vitamin B-12–supplemented women had signiﬁcantly higher plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations at both the second (median vitamin B-12 concentration: 216 vs.111 pmol/L, P< 0.001) and third (median: 184 vs.105 pmol/L, P< 0.001) trimesters.At 6 wk postpartum, median breast milk vitamin B-12 concentration was 136 pmol/L in vitamin B-12–supplemented women vs.87 pmol/L in the placebo group ( P< 0.0005).Among vitamin B-12– supplemented women, the incidence of delivering an infant with intrauterine growth retardation was 33 of 131 (25%) vs.43 of 125 (34%) in those administered placebo ( P= 0.11).
In a subset of infants tested at 6 wk of age, median plasma vitamin B-12 concentration was 199 pmol/L in those born to supplemented women vs. 139 pmol/L in the placebo group ( P= 0.01).Infant plasma methylmalonic acid and homocysteine concentrations were signiﬁcantly lower in the vitamin B-12 group as well.Oral supplementation of urban Indian women with vitamin B-12 throughout pregnancy and early lactation signiﬁcantly increases vitamin B-12 status of mothers and infants.It is important to determine whether there are correlations between these ﬁndings and neurologic and metabolic functions.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00641862.J.Nutr.144: 758–764, 2014.Introduction Pregnant women in resource-poor areas are at risk of mul- tiple micronutrient deﬁciencies, and diets that are low in animal products place women at increased risk of vitamin B-12 deﬁ- ciency (1–6).
Vitamin B-12 acts as a cofactor in the conversionof homocysteine to methionine, as well as the formation of succinyl-CoA from L-methylmalonyl-CoA. Deﬁciency of vitamin B-12 causes macrocytic anemia, neurologic dysfunction, and biochemical abnormalities related to the accumulation of the precursor moieties (hyperhomocysteinemia and methylmalonicacidemia).In turn, hyperhomocysteinemia has been linked to a higher risk of multiple adverse outcomes of pregnancy, includ- ing delivering an infant small for gestational age or with intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR), 12low birth weight (LBW),1Supported by Indian Council of Medical Research grant 5/7/192/06-RHN and Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and HumanDevelopment grants R03 HD054123 and K24HD058795.2Author disclosures: C.Duggan, K.Srinivasan, T.Thomas, T.Samuel, R.Rajendran, S.Muthayya, J.L.Finkelstein, A.Lukose, W.Fawzi, L.H.Allen,R.J.Bosch, and A.V.Kurpad, no conﬂicts of interest.

In pregnant women in Pune, India, total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations in pregnancy were signiﬁcantly and inversely associated with birth weight,adjusting for maternal weight, height, gestational age, and infant sex (11). In a cohort of pregnant women in Bangalore, India, with a high incidence of vitamin B-12 deﬁciency, we reported previ-ously that women in the lowest tertile for plasma vitamin B-12 concentration during all 3 trimesters of pregnancy had signif- icantly higher risk of IUGR that persisted after adjusting formaternal age, weight, education, and parity (12).In addition, vitamin B-12 status in the mother was also related to neonatal vitamin B-12 status as measured by cord plasma vitamin B-12concentrations; low neonatal vitamin B-12 concentrations were associated with LBW (13).
To evaluate the effect of maternal supplementation of vitamin B-12 during pregnancy and lacta-tion on maternal and infant biomarkers of vitamin B-12 status,we performed a randomized, blinded controlled clinical trial in urban pregnant south Indian women. Materials and Methods The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00641862).Recruitment and follow-up were conducted at Hosahalli Referral Hospital, a governmentmaternity health care center predominantly catering to the needs of the women from the lower socioeconomic strata of urban Bangalore.Pregnant women aged $18 y who presented for prenatal care before or at 14 wk of gestational age (as judged by the date of the last menstrualperiod) were eligible for inclusion.
Excluded were those mothers who anticipated moving out of the area before study completion, who had twin or multiple pregnancies, who were treated for infertility, who testedpositive for hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen), HIV, or syphilis(Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test) infections, or who were taking daily vitamin supplements in addition to folic acid and iron. Women with a serious preexisting medical condition (deﬁned as the needfor chronic or daily medication use) were excluded, as were women with a history of previous caesarean section.Sociodemographic information was obtained by interviews com- pleted by trained research assistants.Gestational age (weeks) was cal-culated from the reported ﬁrst day of the last menstrual period.Weights of all the mothers were recorded using a digital balance (Salter /C213s 9016; Tonbridge) to the nearest 100 g, and heights were measured using astadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm.
BMI was calculated as weight inkilograms divided by the height in meters squared. LBW was deﬁned as birth weight <2500 g, and IUGR was deﬁned as birth weight less than the 10th percentile of norms for gestational age (14).Treatment allocation.Women were randomly assigned to receive a daily oral dose of vitamin B-12 (50 mg) or a placebo identical in appear- ance (Cadila Pharmaceuticals) from enrollment through 6 wk postpar-tum.A randomization list from 1 to 370 was prepared by the study biostatistician using permuted blocks of variable size, and women enrolled at the study clinic were provided the next consecutive numberon the list.The randomization list was provided to the pharmacy de-partment in Bangalore, with each number corresponding to a code denoting 1 of the 2 treatment groups.Onsite study pharmacists stored the coded randomization list in a locked ﬁle cabinet and concealedallocation by only displaying the woman /C213s identiﬁcation number on the label of the bottle.
Capsules of the regimen were distributed in bottlescontaining 40 each. The placebo and vitamin B-12 supplement were indistinguishable in terms of taste, smell, and appearance.Study phys-icians, research nurses, and participants were unaware of treatment groups.Provision of standard of care and follow-up.Each pregnant woman was followed up in the clinic once per month until week 32 of pregnancy,then once every 2 wk until week 36, and then once every week until delivery, as per the standard prenatal care visiting schedule in India.As part of standard medical care, all mothers were administered daily iron(60 mg) and folic acid (500 mg) supplementation, diagnosis and treat- ment for sexually transmitted infections, and prophylaxis.
A clinical examination was performed that included vital signs and blood pressure, measurement of weight, height, triceps skin fold, and mid-upper armcircumference, obstetric examination (fetal movement, heart rate, pre- sentation, lie, position), and reproductive and neurologic examinations. Compliance with the daily regimen was measured by research nurses counting unused supplements.Compliance was then calculated by divid-ing the number of pills taken (as determined by pill counts at monthly follow-up visits) by the number of days on study (from random assign- ment to 6 wk postpartum).Mothers who were traveling out of Bangaloretemporarily were provided with extra regimens to sufﬁce until the nextvisit to the research clinic.Mothers were reimbursed for their travel expenses to the study clinic but received no other payment.Those who missed their monthly follow-up appointment were contacted by phoneand/or visited at home and encouraged to return for their next visit.Dietary data.
A pretested interviewer-administered FFQ was used to assess habitual dietary intake for the 3 mo preceding the date of the participant /C213s enrollment in the study. Standard measures were placed before the respondent to quantify the portion size of each food itemwhen administering the FFQ.The FFQ was adapted from 1 developed for an urban south Indian population (15) and has a food list of 127 items, derived from a food database developed from studies at St.John /C213s Medical College, Bangalore.Nutrient scores were computed by multi-plying the relative frequency of consumption of each food item by nutrient content of the standard portion size.Nutrient information was obtained for 27 macronutrients and micronutrients.The total amount offood groups consumed (grams per day) was also calculated.Nutrientintakes were compared with published Indian recommendations (RDAs) (16).Biochemical data.
Approximately 10 mL of blood was drawn from participants by venipuncture and collected in both EDTA and plain vacutainers (BD Biosciences) that were kept on ice until separation in a refrigerated centrifuge, usually within 4 h. Hemoglobin and completeblood count were analyzed on whole-blood samples in an automatedCoulter counter (ABX Pentra C+; Horiba Medicals).The plasma and RBCs were separated and stored at 280/C176C until analysis for vitamin B-12, tHcy, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and erythrocyte folate.Plasma vitamin B-12 was measured by the electrochemiluminescence method (Elecsys 2010; Roche Diagnostics).A plasma concentration <150 pmol/L was considered deﬁcient.Measurement of tHcy and MMAwas performed by GC-MS (model 3800; Varian) (17).The intraday andinterday assay CVs for vitamin B-12 were 0.54% and 2.44%, respec- tively.The interday assay CV for MMA and tHcy was 5.57% and 5.04%, respectively, whereas the intraday assay CV was 6.92% and 5.60%,respectively.
Erythrocyte folate was measured by a competitive immu-noassay with direct chemiluminescence detection on an automated im- munoanalyzer (ADVIA Centaurs; Bayer Health Care Diagnostics) (18), with intra-assay and interassay variabilities of 1.9% and 5.2%, re-spectively. The folate concentration in the hemolysate was converted to values for whole blood by adjusting for the hematocrit.For the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) geno- type analysis, DNA was extracted from the buffy coat by the phenol-chloroform method, and the extracted DNA was puriﬁed by ethanol washing and quantiﬁed using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop ND1000; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).Primers for the MTHFR gene (rs1801133) were designed using Primer 3 plus software.The ampliﬁed products weresequenced using direct sequencing (Big Dye terminator method; Applied Biosystems).
The sequences were evaluated for variants with Finch Vitamin B-12 supplementation during pregnancy 759 version 1.4.0 (Geospiza) and National Center for Biotechnology In- formation BLAST (basic local alignment search tool; bl2seq). Breast milk was collected without restriction regarding time since last feed.After cleaning the nipple and before the mothers nursed the infants, 10 mL of breast milk was expressed manually from 1 breast into a prelabeled plastic opaque vial.The vials were inverted and shaken wellby hand, and ;2–3 mL was portioned into a screw-top polystyrene tube.Five such aliquots were made and stored at 280/C176Cu n t i lt h e y were shipped for analysis.Breast milk vitamin B-12 concentrations were determined by competitive protein binding immu-noassay (Immulite 1000; Siemens) (19).
A single stool sample was collected at the baseline visit from the pregnant women and analyzed immediately for the presence of helmin- thic ova, cysts, and trophozoites by the wet mount method (20). Data management and analysis.All study forms were checked for inconsistencies, and the data were double-entered into a structured querylanguage database by 2 dedicated data entry operators.Discrepancies ormismatches in the data entry were corrected by the study coordinator.In ;10% of the participants, random data checks were conducted between data on paper forms and data entered into the database.Statisticalanalyses were performed with SPSS (SPSS release 2009 and PASWStatistics for Windows version 18.0; both from SPSS) The normality of the data was examined by graphically evaluating Q–Q plots.Normally distributed data are expressed as means 6SDs or medians (quartile 1, quartile 3).
The effect of maternal vitamin B-12 supplementation on maternal and infant biomarkers of vitamin B-12 status was determined by comparing these outcomes between study groups by Mann-WhitneyUtest for continuous variables and x 2test for categorical variables. The primary efﬁcacy analysis was the comparison of change in vitamin B-12 status from the ﬁrst to third trimester using the Mann-Whitney Utest.Planned complementary measures of vitamin B-12 status, includingmaternal MMA and tHcy concentrations, were also compared.Stratiﬁedanalyses and tests for interaction using ANOVA were performed to identify potential effect modiﬁers.Mixed linear analysis of log-transformed vitamin B-12 status and breast milk vitamin B-12 concentrations wereperformed with time as a random effect and intervention group as a ﬁxed effect.Multiple variable logistic regression was performed to assesspotential effect modiﬁers with study arm on birth outcomes, such as preterm birth, LBW, and IUGR.
An alevel of <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. A planned sample size of 150 women per arm provided 80% power to detect a difference in maternal vitamin B-12 concentrations between the arms of 18.1 pmol/L, corresponding to a10% increase in mean vitamin B-12 concentration of ;180 pmol/L (12).To account for anticipated loss to follow-up and the use of nonpara- metric testing, we enrolled 366 women.Ethics.Institutional approval was granted by the Institutional Ethical Board of St.John /C213s Medical College and the Harvard School of Public Health Human Subjects Committee.A Data Safety and Monitoring Board met twice annually during the course of the study.All womenprovided written informed consent.Results The study proﬁle is shown in Figure 1 .P r e g n a n tw o m e n( n=3 6 6 ) were enrolled from December 2008 to December 2010.
Table 1 shows baseline (ﬁrst trimester) maternal characteristics and con- ﬁrms that the 2 study groups were comparable on measures of age, socioeconomic characteristic s, and nutritional status. Dietary energy intake was generally low, and intake of vitamin B-12 waslower than the RDA for Indian women in 44% of participants.Nearly one-third (30%) of women were anemic (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) at baseline, 51% had low plasma concentrations of vitaminB-12 (<150 pmol/L), and 42% had impaired vitamin B-12 status (vitamin B-12 <150 pmol/L and MMA >0.26 mmol/L).Three- fourths of the women had elevated MMA, and one-fourth hadelevated tHcy.Giardia lamblia was detected in 10 (3%) women.FIGURE 1 Summary of screening, recruitment, and randomization.

The median change in maternal vitamin B-12 status from the ﬁrst to second trimester in the supplemented arm was 36.5 (22.6, 50.2) pmol/L, and this was signiﬁcantly different ( P< 0.001) from the decline in the placebo arm, 246.3 (266.7,225.9) pmol/L. No signiﬁ- cant group differences in maternal MMA, tHcy, or prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) were noted at the second or thirdtrimester time points.Among the women who were adminis- tered vitamin B-12, the mean 6SD compliance rate was 69 6 17%, and among those who were administered placebo, it was 70613% ( P= 0.74).Vitamin B-12 concentrations in breast milk among 68 vita- min B-12–supplemented mothers was signiﬁcantly higher than that of 73 women who were administered placebo when sup-plementation ended at 6 wk postpartum ( Table 2 ).However, breast milk vitamin B-12 concentrations at 3 and 6 mo post- partum were not signiﬁcantly different between the treatmentgroups.
Figure 3 shows plasma vitamin B-12, MMA, and tHcy con- centrations obtained from a subset of infants at 6 wk of age. Com-pared with infants whose mothe rs were administered placebo ( n= 34), infants of the vitamin B-12–supplemented women ( n=4 3 )h a d signiﬁcantly higher plasma vita min B-12 concentrations (median v i t a m i nB - 1 2c o n c e n t r a t i o n :1 9 9v s .1 3 9p m o l / L , P< 0.001), as well as lower MMA (0.09 vs.0.16 mmol/L, P= 0.022) and tHcy (10.9 vs.21.0 mmol/L, P< 0.001) concentrations.Clinical outcomes of the pregnancies were recorded, al- though the trial was not powered to detect differences in these.In the vitamin B-12 arm, 24 of 131 (18%) mothers underwent elective caesarean section vs.13 of 125 (10%) in the placebogroup ( P= 0.06).The frequency of LBW was not statistically signiﬁcantly different between the 2 arms (12% in the vitamin B-12 group vs.16% in the placebo group, P= 0.38), nor was mean birth weight (2.85 60.46 kg in the vitamin B-12 group vs.
2.8360.45 kg in the placebo group). Among the vitamin B-12– supplemented women, the incidence of delivering an infant with IUGR was 33 of 131 (25%) vs.43 of 125 (34%) in placeborecipients ( P= 0.11).Stratiﬁed analyses were performed to assess whether vitamin B-12 supplementation was more effective in women with base-line vitamin B-12 deﬁciency, baseline body weight < 50 kg, or low dietary intake of vitamin B-12.There was no evidence of a differential effect of the intervention by baseline vitamin B-12concentration or body weight on the second and third trimesterplasma vitamin B-12 concentration, maternal weight gain, or birth weight ( P> 0.30 for tests of interaction).Similarly, there was no evidence for differential effects of the intervention on theoutcomes of preterm birth, LBW , or IUGR.
Among women whose dietary intake of vitamin B-12 was less than the Indian RDA during pregnancy (1.2 mg/d) in the ﬁrst trimester, the frequency of IUGR was 17 of 61 (28%) in the vitamin B-12 group and 17 of 50 (34%) in the placebo group ( P=0 . 1 4b y x 2test).TheMTHFR C677T single nucleotide polymorphism was screened in a total of 359 mothers.The frequencies of MTHFR 677C and 677T alleles were found to be 93% and 7%, re- spectively.The frequency of MTHFR homozygous genotype 677CC was 89% in the vitamin B-12 group and 85% in the FIGURE 2 Effect of dietary supplementation with vitamin B-12 in pregnant Indian women compared with placebo on maternal plasmaconcentrations of vitamin B-12 ( A), MMA ( B), and homocysteine ( C).Values are median and interquartile range, n= 182 to 102.*B12 different from P, P,0.001 by Mann-Whitney Utest.B12, Vitamin B-12 group; Hcy, homocysteine; MMA, methylmalonic acid; P, placebogroup.

Vitamin B-12 supplementation during pregnancy 761 placebo group ( P= 0.18), and the frequency of homozygous 677TT was 0.6% in both groups ( P= 1.00).Discussion In this randomized, blinded clinical trial of vitamin B-12 supple- mentation during pregnancy and early lactation, we found that urban south Indian women responded with higher plasma and breast milk concentrations of vitamin B-12.
In addition, infantsborn to vitamin B-12–supplemen ted mothers had higher plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations and lower tHcy and MMA concen- trations, indicative of improved vitamin B-12 status. Several studies suggested that vitamin B-12 status in women in resource-limited countries is poor.Among 113 Guatemalan women, plasma vitamin B-12 was deﬁcient or low in nearly50%, breast milk vitamin B-12 concentration was low in 31%, and low breast milk vitamin B-12 correlated signiﬁcantly withinfant urinary MMA (21).A limited number of studies ad- dressed vitamin B-12 status among Indian women and their infants.In 1 early study in Mumbai, India, mean serum vitamin B-12 concentration in lacto-vegetarian women was lower thanthat of nonvegetarian women (71.8 vs.134.0 pmol/L, respec- tively, P< 0.01) (22).In another study from Mumbai, mean plasma vitamin B-12 in pregnant nonanemic women was 50.2vs.131.3 pmol/L in nonpregnant women ( P< 0.001) (23).
Of note, vitamin B-12 concentrations in all of the groups reported in these studies were generally low. Although to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst trial of supple- mental vitamin B-12 among pregnant Indian women, 2 previous randomized trials of vitamin B-12 supplementation in India arerelevant to our ﬁndings.In Pune, nonpregnant vegetarian womenresponded to 500 mg of vitamin B-12, with a mean increase in serum vitamin B-12 over 2 wk of 125–215 pmol/L ( P< 0.05) and reduced tHcy concentrations (18.0–13.0 mmol/L, P< 0.05) (24).In a longer trial of lower doses of vitamin B-12 (0, 2, and 10 mg) with or without 200 mg of folic acid among families in Pune, 12 mo of 10 mg of vitamin B-12 increased mean serum vitamin B-12 concentrations from 159 to 307 pmol/L ( P< 0.0001) and reduced tHcy concentrations from 18.5 to 11.6 mmol/L ( P< 0.0001) (25).
However, both of these trials excluded pregnantwomen, in whom progressive declines in vitamin B-12 plasmaconcentrations are known to occur, and neither reported clinical outcomes. In conjunction with an observational study among pregnant rural and urban Indian women (26) wherein a cumu-lative dose of vitamin B-12 >1000 mg during pregnancy was associated with lower tHcy concentrations at 34 wk, it seems likely that vitamin B-12 supplementation in pregnant Indianwomen is an effective way to improve vitamin B-12 status.The ﬁnding that maternal supplementation during pregnancy and lactation signiﬁcantly increased vitamin B-12 concentra-tions in breast milk is novel and potentially important.Early studies of well-nourished women did not conﬁrm that vitamin B-12 supplementation increased breast milk concentrations ofthis nutrient (27).However, among U.S.
women of low socio-economic status, 8 mg of vitamin B-12 provided during lactation increased vitamin B-12 milk concentration to 0.79 mg/L at 6 wk postpartum compared with 0.55 mg/L in unsupplemented women ( P< 0.05) (28). These studies used an older radioisotope dilution method for measuring milk vitamin B-12 concentra- tions, the validity of which has been questioned (29), as opposedto our chemiluminescence method, so direct comparisons are difﬁcult to make.Nonetheless, it does seem that maternal supplementation of vitamin B-12 among women of marginalvitamin B-12 status is an effective method to increase vitamin B-12 breast milk concentration.Of note, the effect of supple- mentation may not persist after the period of supplementation;breast milk vitamin B-12 concentrations in our study weresigniﬁcantly higher in the vitamin B-12 group compared with the placebo group only at 6 wk postpartum, the time when sup- plementation ended.
At subsequent time points in the postpar-tum period, values of breast milk vitamin B-12 concentration were higher in the vitamin B-12 group, but this difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. In our trial, vitamin B-12–supplemented mothers had higher blood vitamin B-12 concentrations during pregnancy but not signiﬁcantly lower MMA or tHcy blood concentrations.In con-trast, all 3 measures of vitamin B-12 nutritional status wereimproved in infants.These ﬁndings are difﬁcult to interpret clearly.One possibility is that supplementary vitamin B-12 was preferentially shunted to fetal tissues and therefore did not resultin improved maternal vitamin B-12 status.Possibly supportive FIGURE 3 Effect of dietary supplementation with vitamin B-12 in pregnant Indian women compared with placebo on infant plasma concentrations of vitamin B-12 ( A), MMA ( B), and Hcy ( C) at 6 wk after birth.Values are medians and IQRs, n= 43 in the vitamin B-12 group and 34 in the placebo group.
*B-12 different from P, P,0.001 by Mann-Whitney Utest. B12, Vitamin B-12 group; Hcy, homocysteine; MMA, methylmalonic acid; P, placebo group.762 Duggan et al.of this hypothesis is the ﬁnding that infants whose mothers were administered placebo had generally higher tHcy concentrations (median: 21.0 mmol/L) than reported as normal amounts in healthy infants (30) (6–9 mmol/L at ages 6 wk to 6 mo).Among rural Indian newborns with high rates of LBW, median (IQR) concentrations of tHcy have been reported as 11.7 (8.3–14.7) mmol/L (31).Previous data demonstrating umbilical cord vita- min B and related metabolite amounts 2- to 6-fold higher than maternal serum concentrations are also suggestive of a high fetal demand for these nutrients (32).
Another possibility is that de-clines in tHcy and MMA observed during pregnancy are phe- nomena not clearly related to deﬁciency status and that vitamin B-12 supplementation increased maternal blood vitamin B-12concentration, as well as infant markers of vitamin B-12 status.Better biochemical assays (e.g., holo-transcobalamin II) and func- tional outcome measures in mothers and children would help address this possibility. The relation between maternal and infant vitamin B-12 status has been the subject of limited studies (33).Although fetal and maternal plasma concentrations of vitamin B-12 are reported tocorrelate strongly (34), some suggest that maternal dietary in- take during pregnancy is a stronger determinant of infant vita- min B-12 status than are maternal vitamin B-12 stores (35).Among breast-fed Norwegian infants administered i.m.
vitaminB-12 injections at 6 wk of age, higher vitamin B-12 and lower tHcy and MMA concentrations were noted up to age 4 mo, suggesting that marginal vitamin B-12 status may be observed inbreast-fed infants whose mothers are presumably eating a Western diet (36). Our data suggest that oral maternal vitamin B-12 supplementation is effective at improving infant vitaminB-12 status, as well (37).In addition to its effect on child vitamin B-12 status, vitamin B-12 status in pregnancy may also have an effect on long-termchild health.In the Pune cohort, infants of mothers who were in the lowest decile of vitamin B-12 concentrations at 28 wk of gestation performed less well on tests of attention and memorycompared with infants born to mothers of the highest decile(38).This group also reported that low maternal vitamin B-12 plasma concentrations in pregnancy were correlated with insulin resistance, as measured by the HOMA-IR in children aged 6 y(39).
This observed relation between low vitamin B-12 concen- trations in pregnancy and child insulin resistance was also sup- ported by data from Nepal, but supplementation of pregnantwomen with vitamin B-12–containing micronutrients was not found to affect child HOMA-IR (40). Recent data linked higher child vitamin B-12 concentrations, as well as lower tHcy andMMA concentrations, with imp roved mental development scores at 12–18 mo (41).A recent study also showed that infant vitamin B-12 supplementation was associated with improvedgross motor function and less frequent gastrointestinal regurgi-tation compared with placebo (42).Our ﬁndings of higher ma- ternal vitamin B-12 concentration after supplementation and the ﬁnding of increased breast milk and infant plasma vitamin B-12concentrations suggest that supplementation with vitamin B-12 during pregnancy can have an effect on infant vitamin B-12 status and health outcomes.
Longer follow-up of our cohort for cardio-metabolic and neurodevelopmental status will allow us to deter- mine whether these other importa nt child outcomes are affected by maternal supplementation durin g pregnancy and early lactation. Our study has several limitations.Our moderate sample size may have limited our ability to detect clinical differences in the study arms, and we were not powered to detect differences in birth outcomes, including the frequency of LBW and IUGR.Inaddition, some suggested that serum holo-transcobalamin maybe a more valid marker of vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy than the markers we used (43).Finally, not all infants underwent blood drawing to assess vitamin B-12 status.In summary, maternal supplementation during pregnancy and early lactation with 50 mg of daily oral vitamin B-12 sig- niﬁcantly improved maternal plasma and breast milk measures of vitamin B-12 status, as well as multiple measures of infantvitamin B-12 status.
Determining the clinical and long-term effects of these biochemical ﬁndings will be of great interest.
