Food allergies represent a serious public health problem worldwide with ﬁsh being one o f the top eight more allergenic foods.Parvalbumins, have been identiﬁed as the main ﬁsh allergen.
In this study,weattemptedtoproducealowallergenicfarmedﬁshwi thimprovedmusclequality in controlled artiﬁcial conditions by supplementing a comm ercial ﬁsh diet with different creatine percentages. The supplementation of ﬁsh diets wit h speciﬁc nutrients, aimed at reducing the expression of parvalbumin, can be considere d of higher interest and beneﬁcial in terms of food safety and human health.The effec ts of these supplemented dietsonﬁshgrowth,physiologicalstress,ﬁshmusclestatu s,andparvalbuminmodulation wereinvestigated.Datafromzootechnicalparameterswere usedtoevaluateﬁshgrowth, food conversion ratios and hepatosomatic index.Physiolog ical stress responses were assessedbymeasuringcortisolreleasesandmusclequality analyzedby rigormortis and pH.Parvalbumin,creatine,andglycogenconcentrationsin musclewerealsodetermined.Comparative proteomics was used to look into changes in musc le and liver tissues at protein level.
Our results suggest that the supplementatio n of commercial ﬁsh diets with creatine does not affect farmed ﬁsh productivity parameter s, or either muscle quality. Additionally, the effect of higher concentrations of creat ine supplementation revealed a minor inﬂuence in ﬁsh physiological welfare.Differences at the proteome level were detected among ﬁsh fed with different diets.Differential m uscle proteins expression was identiﬁed as tropomyosins, beta enolase, and creatine kina se among others, whether in liver several proteins involved in the immune system, cel lular processes, stress, and inﬂammation response were modulated.Regarding parvalbum in modulation, the tested Schrama et al.

Keywords: creatine, aquaculture, gilthead seabream, parva lbumin, proteomics, ﬁsh nutrition, muscle quality INTRODUCTION Proteins from ﬁsh are becoming an important and healthier alternative to protein from other animals.Essential amino a cids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, micronutrients and high-qual ity proteins are present in ﬁsh in considerable amounts ( Beveridge et al., 2013; Kuehn et al., 2014 ).Due to the high amount of consumption, ﬁsh supplies are needed to increase rapidly (Thurstan and Roberts, 2014 ) and subsequently aquaculture is a fast-growing industry.
Farmed ﬁsh are subjected to importa nt standards such as food safety, ﬁsh welfare, and muscle qualit y (Silva et al., 2012a ) with the evaluation of farmed ﬁsh quality and safety being of great concern regarding human health and acceptancebyconsumers(withaddedvalueforthesustainabi lity of aquaculture industry). There are many external and inter nal inﬂuencing factors that aﬀect the freshness quality of ﬁsh but texture of muscle, rigor mortis and pH play a critical role in the evaluation of ﬁsh quality ( Wang B.et al., 2015 ).Nutrients or special ingredients in diets are known to inﬂuence ﬁsh quality , as well as pre-slaughter stress and post-mortem processes ( Silva etal.,2012a;WangB.etal.,2015 ).Informationregardingtheuse of dietary supplements as ﬁnishing strategies to modulate post- mortem degradation of overall ﬂesh quality criteria in seab ream muscle is extremely scarce.
It is known that proper slaughter techniques,cansparethemuscle’senergyreservesanddelaypo st- mortem degradation processes, with positive impact on ﬂesh quality. Recently, cutting-edge technologies such as proteo mics have been emerging as a valuable tool in both aquaculture products analysis and food allergens studies ( Rodrigues et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2014a; Hoﬀmann-Sommergruber, 2016 ).Proteomics provides a deeper knowledge of an organism’s physiological state by comparing changes in the proteome of a tissue,ﬂuidorcellatagivenmoment( Rodriguesetal.,2012;Piras etal.,2016 ).Fish allergies show a point prevalence of 0.6% for all aged populationinEuropeandalifetimeprevalenceof2.17%( Nwaru et al., 2014 ), in case of children this can reach 8% worldwide (Sicherer and Sampson, 2014 ).In 95% of the cases, ﬁsh allergies are due to the parvalbumin protein, the major allergen in ﬁsh (Kuehn et al., 2010 ).
Enolase, aldolase and gelatin were also identiﬁed as minor ﬁsh allergens ( Kuehn et al., 2014 ). Parvalbumins are proteins with a low molecular weight (10–12 kDa), acidic (pH 3.5–4.5), very stable, calcium-binding (Ca2+) and are present in higher amount in white muscle ( Van Do et al., 2005 ) compared to dark one.Parvalbumins are divided into two lineages, αandβ, but it has been shown that the majority of ﬁsh species parvalbumins belong to the βlineage (Lindstrom et al., 1996 ), being considered as the more allergenic one (Griesmeier et al., 2010 ).Various isoforms of parvalbuminhavebeenidentiﬁeddependingonﬁshspecies( Bealeetal.,2009 ) anddevelopmentalstage( Huriauxetal.,2002 ).Parvalbuminisaproteinpresentinﬁshmuscle,wherecreatine is used as a molecule to enhance bioenergetics.In vertebrat es, creatine takes part in the ATP (adenosine triphosphate)/PCr (phosphocreatine)phosphateenergysystem,beinganimportant substrate to increase ATP by the breakdown of PCr ( Kraemer et al., 2013 ).
The endogenous synthesis of creatine is regulated by the AGAT (L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase) enzy me, transferring the amidino group of arginine to glycine, produc ing L-ornithine, and guanidinoacetic acid, which is methylated , resulting in the production of creatine ( Kraemer et al., 2013 ). In ﬁsh, creatine has been found in white muscle both in its free and phosphorylated forms and is present in higher amounts thaninmammals( Hunter,1929;DanulatandHochachka,1989 ).It contributes to the relaxation and contraction of the musc le.Creatine use has not been studied extensively in ﬁsh nutriti on, but phosphocreatine has been addressed in various experiments of ﬁsh exercise ( McFarlane et al., 2001 ).In juvenile rainbow trout, creatine supplementation showed to contribute most to a higher endurance during a ﬁxed velocity test without diﬀeren ces observed in total creatine content in muscle ( McFarlane et al., 2001).
Also, supplementation with creatine in zebraﬁsh showed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in lean body mass compared to control (Domas et al., 2016 ). The muscle mechanism of relaxation and contraction might suﬀer changes if the expression of speciﬁc proteins involved in the kinetics of calcium, like parvalbumi n, are modiﬁed ( Gallo et al., 2008 ).These authors studied the eﬀect of added creatine in the diets of rats showing a signiﬁca nt decrease in skeletal muscle parvalbumin content ( Gallo et al., 2008).In this study the authors hypothesized that elevating the capacity for high energy phosphate shuttling through creatine loading, alleviates the need for intracellular Ca2+buﬀering by parvalbumin and increases the eﬃciency of Ca2+uptake by Ca2+-ATPases.
In this study, commercial ﬁsh diets for gilthead seabream (Sparusaurata )weresupplementedwithdiﬀerentpercentagesof creatine(2,5,and8%)anditseﬀectsonmusclequality,proteome andparvalbuminmodulationwereanalyzed.Theliverproteome was also studied due to its central role in the majority of key metabolicprocesses. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fish and Rearing Conditions For this trial, 24 gilthead seabream per tank were reared in 500L conical tanks, with natural ﬂow-through seawater at th e Ramalhete experimental station of the University of Algarve, Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 2 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1844 Schrama et al.Creatine Supplementation in Gilthead Seabream Faro, Portugal (from July till September).Tank triplicates we re used for each tested diet.
Fish with an initial body weight of 170±1.4g, were fed twice a day by hand, ad libitum and kept with natural temperature (23.3 ±0.93◦C, with minimum and maximum of 21.2 and 25.0◦C, respectively), artiﬁcial aeration (dissolved oxygen above 5mg L−1), and salinity (33.2 ±2 ‰). Tanks were exposed to natural environmental and photoperiod conditions.The experiment was performed according with the ﬁsh welfare regulations established in the EU, Council Dire ctive 2010/63/EU and Portuguese legislation for the use of labora tory animals,permitnumber0420/00/000-n.9909/11/2009.Experimental Diets Fish were fed a control diet (CTRL), similar to a commercial feed (TableS1), formulated based on estimated requirements of Sparus aurata (Sparos, Lda., Olhão, Portugal).Three diﬀerent concentrations of creatine were added to the control diet in order to get experimental diets with 2, 5, and 8% of creatine (Sparos, Lda., Olhão, Portugal).
The procedures for productio n follow the methods described in Schrama et al. (2017) with slight modiﬁcations.The creatine was incorporated in the oi l fractioninconcentrations(2,5,and8%)accordingtoeachta rget formulationandappliedbyvacuumcoatinginaPegasusvacuum mixer(PG-10VCLAB,DINNISEN,TheNetherlands).Sampling After 69 days of trial, all ﬁsh (72 per diet) were sampled.Twelve ﬁsh per tank were randomly picked and lethally anesthetized withMS-222(SigmaAldrich).Bloodwasimmediatelywithdrawn from the caudal vein using heparinized syringes and liver collectedandweightedforhepatosomaticindex.Musclesamples were taken from the right dorsal.All samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80◦C till further analysis.The remaining 12ﬁshofeachtankwere sampled in iceand waterfor ﬁsh quality measurements.Filets of 5 ﬁsh were preserved on ic e forinstrumentaltextureanalysis(within24hafterslaugh tering).Four ﬁsh were maintained on ice for rigor mortis assessment.
ThreeﬁshwereusedformusclepHdeterminations.Allﬁshwere weightandmeasured. Cortisol Measurements Blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000 ×g for 20min and plasma collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80◦Ctillfurtheranalysis.Plasmacortisolwerethendetermin ed using a commercially available ELISA kit (RE52061, IBL International), previously validated for Sparus aurata (Lopez- Olmeda et al., 2009 ) with a sensitivity of 2.5 ng ml−1, and intra and inter-assay coeﬃcients of variation (CV) of 2.9 and 3.5%, respectively.
Parvalbumin and Creatine Concentration in Muscle Parvalbumin and creatine concentration were both determin ed using commercially available kits following manufacturer ’s instructions(Fish-CheckELISAkit,Bio-Check,UKandCreat ine assaykit,SigmaAldrich,respectively).Glycogen Determination in Muscle Glycogen, a carbohydrate, is the most important energy sourc e in post-mortem muscle and was determined only in control and creatine 8% dietary treatments using the method described by VilesandSilverman(1949) .Resultswereexpressedas µgpermg ofmuscle(dryweight). Metabolic Fingerprinting by Solid Phase Transmissive Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy Liver tissue is frequently used as an index of nutritional st atus in ﬁsh.Therefore, liver tissues of 5 ﬁsh per tank (i.e., 15 ﬁsh per dietary treatment) from control and creatine 8% dietary treatments were lyophilized.
Using an agate pestle and mortar as described by ( Silva et al., 2014a ), each liver sample was mixed with KBr (following a ratio of 500mg KBr per 5mg of sample) until homogenous. The main absorption bands were attributed to the corresponding biomolecules according to Silva etal.(2014a) .Texture Analysis From each raw ﬁlet (5 ﬁsh per tank) a muscle section (with skin) of ∼3×2×1.2 (height) cm was taken for texture proﬁle analysis (TPA) on a TA.XT plusanalyzer (Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, UK) equipped with a load cell of 30kg.The muscle pieces were compressed twice with a 50mm diameter cylindrical metal probe (P50) at a constant speed of 2 mm/s up to 40% of the ﬁlet height.Measurements were done at room temperature ( ∼20◦C).The primary characteristics hardness, springiness, adhesiveness and cohesiveness were determine d.Chewiness (secondary characteristic) was calculated as th e product of hardness, cohesiveness and springiness ( Hyldig and Nielsen,2001;CarecheandBarroso,2009 ).
Rigor mortis and pH Rigor mortis is one of the indexes of ﬁsh quality and it was determined using both sides of the ﬁsh at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, and 72h after slaughter, as described by Matos et al. (2010) .Fishwerehandledcarefullyinordertopreventsecondaryeﬀect s on the development of the rigorstate.Determination of the pH values of the ﬁsh muscle was done at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, and 48h after slaughter, using a pH meter (Eutech waterproof pH spear).At each time a new incision in the ﬂesh of the same ﬁsh was made.Protein Extraction and CyDye Labeling For a total protein extraction, muscle samples were individual ly homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax IKA T8 (IKA-WERG) in a DIGE buﬀer (7M urea, 2M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 30mM Tris, pH8.5)containing1mMEDTAand1%(v/v)proteaseinhibitor.Homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10min at 4◦C to pellet insoluble material.
The resulting supernatants wer e quantiﬁed using Quick StartTMBradford Protein Assay with bovinealbuminasstandard(Bio-Rad). In order to simplify the protein mixture and the analysis, a fractionation approach of the muscle tissue was performed.Fractionation allows to increase the number of visualized Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1844 Schrama et al.Creatine Supplementation in Gilthead Seabream proteins and to raise the concentration of low-abundance proteins by depletion of the highly abundant myoﬁbrillar proteins( Silvaetal.,2010,2012a ).Proteinsfromthesarcoplasmic fractionofthemusclewereextractedusingalysisbuﬀer(50m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1mM EDTA, 10mM DTT) containing 0.5% (v/v) protease inhibitor.An Ultra-turrax IKA T8 (IKA-WERG) was used to homogenize the samples and after a 30min settle on ice centrifugation occurred for 20min at 11,200 ×g at 4◦C.
The resulting supernatants were then depleted of non-protein contaminants using a ReadyPrepTM2D Clean-up kit (Bio-Rad) and resuspended in DIGE buﬀer. Proteins were quantiﬁed as describedbefore.For DIGE minimal labeling, after pH adjustment of protein extracts to pH 8.5 by addition of 0.3M NaOH, 50 µg of proteinswerelabeledwith400pmolofﬂuorescentaminereacti ve cyaninedyesfreshlydissolvedinanhydrousdimethylforma mide following manufacturer’s instructions (5 nmol minimal lab eling kit, GE Healthcare).Three samples per dietary treatment were labeled with Cy3 and three with Cy5 to prevent confounding of an eventual “dye eﬀect” with the biological eﬀect we want to measure.An internal control consisting of equal quantitie s of proteinfromallsampleswaslabeledwithCy2.Liver samples were individually homogenized using DIGE buﬀer as described above for total protein extraction.
The resulting supernatants were then depleted of non-protein contaminants using a ReadyPrepTM2-D Cleanup kit (Bio-Rad) andproteinswerequantiﬁedandlabeledaspreviouslydescribe d. Two-Dimension Gel Electrophoresis Labeled proteins from muscle samples were ﬁrst separated according to their isoelectric point on 24cm ImmobilineTM Drystrip with a pH 3–7 linear gradient (GE healthcare) as parvalbumin—thetargetprotein—hasanknownacidicpHof ≈4 (Van Do et al., 2005 ).In case of liver samples a pH of 4–7 linear gradient has been chosen following the ﬁndings of Richard et al.(2016)in which this pH ensure the best compromise between highcoverageandgoodproteinseparation.Foreachstrip,50 µg of protein of one sample from each dietary treatment plus 50 µg ofinternalstandard,dilutedinrehydrationbuﬀer(ReadyPre p2- D starter kit, Bio-Rad) to a ﬁnal volume of 450 µl, were loaded overnightinanIPGbox(GEHealthcare)bypassiverehydratio n.
Isoelectric focusing was performed using an EttanTMIPGphorTM 3isoelectricfocusingunit(GEHealthcare),at20◦C. In muscle samples voltage gradually raised from 0 to 500V over the course of 1h, kept constant at 500V for 1h, then gradually raised to 1,000V over the course of 1h and ﬁnally gradually raised to 8,000V over the course of 3h, ﬁnishing wi th astepof5h40minataconstantvoltageforatotalof60,000V.h, with a maximum current of 75 µA per strip.In liver samples voltage gradually raised from 0 to 250V over the course of 4h, thengraduallyraisedto1,000Voverthecourseof6handﬁnal ly graduallyraisedto8,000Voverthecourseof3h40min,ﬁnish ing withastepof3h20minataconstantvoltageof8,000Vforatot al of48,000V.h,withamaximumcurrentof75 µAperstrip.
After separation of proteins in the ﬁrst dimension, focused proteins were reduced for 15min in 6ml of equilibration buﬀer (6M urea, 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 30% (v/v)glycerol) with 2% (w/v) DTT, and then alkylated for 15min in 6ml of equilibration buﬀer with 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide. The equilibrated strips were then placed onto 12.5% acrylamide gel cast between low ﬂuorescence glass cassettes (EttanDALT six gel caster system, GE Healthcare), and sealed with 0.5% (w/v)agarosein1 ×electrophoresisbuﬀer[25mMTris,192mM Glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS] and a trace of bromophenol blue.Proteins were separated according to their molecular weight in a second dimension by SDS-PAGE, using an EttanDALT system under constant amperage of 10mA per gel for 1h followed by constant amperage of 40mA per gel until the bromophenol blue dye front reached the bottom of the gels.The electrophoresis buﬀer was used at 1 ×concentration in the lower chamber and 2×concentrationintheupperchamber.
Gel Image Acquisition and Analysis Obtained gels were scanned with a Typhoon TrioTMVariable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare) using three laser emission ﬁlters (520BP40 for Cy2, 580BP30 for Cy3, 670BP30 for Cy5) at a resolution of 100 µm. Image analysis was performed using the SameSpotsTMSoftware(TotalLab).Aﬁlterofaveragenormalized volume≤100,000 and a spot area ≤500 was used to eliminate small impurities before analysis.Preliminary assessment o f data qualitywasperformedusingPrincipalComponentAnalysiswith autoscaling.2DEgelanalysiswasperformedfollowingguidel ines ofSilvaetal.(2014b) .Protein Identiﬁcation by Mass Spectrometry Spots with a signiﬁcant diﬀerence by one-way variance of signiﬁcance[ANOVA( p<0.05)]weremanuallyexcisedfromthe preparativegels.Alsoafalsediscoveryrate(FDR)of q<0.05was applied to minimize the number of false positives.
Protein spots fromthemusclesampleswereidentiﬁedattheGIGAproteomics facility (Liège University, Liège, Belgium) while protein spots from liver samples were sent and analyzed at the Center of Biosustainability (Technical University of Denmark, Hørsh olm, Denmark). At the GIGA proteomics facility trypsin in gel digestion was performed in 96 well plate format on the working station Janus (Perkin Elmer).Spots were washed twice for 5mi n in 50µl of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate on a shaker.Wash was discarded and 50 µl of 50% acetonitrile/50mM ammonium bicarbonate was added for 5min on a shaker, this step was repeated once.Fifty microliter of 10mM DTT was added per well and left on a shaker for 45min at 56◦C.The DTT was removed and 40 µl of 55mM iodoacetamide was added and mixed for 1min.The plate was incubated at 20◦C for 1h.Liquid was discarded and 50 µl of 50% acetonitrile/50mM ammonium bicarbonate was added for 5min on a shaker (twice).

Statistical Analysis Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed using a one-way analys is of variance [ANOVA ( p<0.05)] followed by a post-hoc Tukey (p<0.05).In case of glycogen determination and FTIR analysis a Student’s T-test was performed ( p<0.05).Cortisol and r igor mortis data were previously transformed by log and arcsine square root, respectively.Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were previously checked using Shapiro–Wilk and Levene’s tests, respectively, ( p<0.05).In case of cortisol analysis, a Grubbs’ test was performed prior t o statistical signiﬁcance analysis.Results are presented in m ean ±standard error of the mean (S.E.M.).
All statistical analyses were performed using the R project for statistical computing (version 3.5.0) and GraphPadR⃝v6.0 for windows was used for chartbuildingandﬁgureslayout. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Zootechnical Analysis In this study, at a performance level, ﬁsh fed with the diﬀerent tested diets, show similar growth after 69 days of trial.The box plots show the initial distribution of the ﬁsh, with a mean body weight of 170 ±1.4g and a ﬁnal body weight of 281 ±4.15g (Figure1).InTable1, zootechnical results show the initial and ﬁnal body weight (IBW and FBW, respectively), weight gain per day, speciﬁc growth rate (SGR) per day, thermal growth coeﬃcient (TGC), feed conversion rates (FCR), and feed eﬃciency (FE) for all treatments without any signiﬁcan t diﬀerencesamongtreatmentsandnomortalitieswereregiste red.Moreover, hepatosomatic index (HSI) results ( Figure2) show no signiﬁcant diﬀerences among treatments suggesting that FIGURE 1 | Box plots of the ﬁsh weight distributions.

Also, this ﬁsh species is produced in higher temperatures, which are related with higher intrinsic energy demands. The regulation and usage of creatine is known to be dependent on the body temperature, which in ﬁsh is dependent on the surrounding temperature ( Burns and Gatlin, 2016 ).In rainbow trout, for instance, Borchel et al.(2014) showed diﬀerences in their gene-expression regarding acclimation temperatures lined up with creatine expression, supporting the previous statement.Regardingourstudy,thisraisesthequestionifcr eatine supplementation, has led to a higher muscle power output (to some extent) as seen in mice ( Gallo et al., 2008 ) rather than to aneﬀectiveeﬀectongrowthparameters.Metabolites To analyze the ﬁrst stress barrier in ﬁsh, cortisol levels were determined using an ELISA test.
Our ﬁndings show that ﬁsh fed with 8% supplementation creatine diets show signiﬁcantly lower values of cortisol than ﬁsh fed with control diets and ﬁsh fed with 5% supplementation of creatine ( p=0.006 and p=0.014, respectively; one-way ANOVA followed by post- hocTukey) (Figure3).

No signiﬁcant differences were observed among treatments (one -way ANOVA p>0.05). would expect ﬁsh fed creatine supplemented diets to show lower increases in plasma cortisol concentrations than ﬁsh fed a no n- supplemented diet.As so, feeding periods, normally related wit h increasesofcortisollevels,wouldoriginatelessindivid ualarousal and more ability to adjust their performance and behavior.Hence, lower cortisol levels would be detected with loading creatine diets.Lower arousal lined with reduced cortisol l evels were seen by Sanchez et al.(2009) in seabream, when subjected toarandomvs.schedulefeedingtimes.Nevertheless,therearevariousfactorsthataltercortiso llevels in addition to stress which has been often reviewed [several factors have been referred, that might inﬂuence the diverge nt concentrations reported over similar conditions, within an d between ﬁsh species (see review from Ellis et al., 2012 )].
Excess cortisollevelshavebeenassociatedwithpoorgrowthingold ﬁsh, despite normal food intake ( Bernier et al., 2004 ). In our trial, although ﬁsh show high values of cortisol, physiological stre ss FIGURE 3 | Cortisol (nM) concentration in plasma and Parvalbumin (ppm /ng) concentration in muscle of gilthead seabream after 69 days o f trial.Values are means (n=15) and errors bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM ).Different letters represent signiﬁcant differences (one-w ay ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey,p<0.05).does not seem to be aﬀected.In fact, increasing creatine concentration, seems to decrease ﬁsh stress levels.Supporti ng such statement, in our study, ﬁsh almost doubled body weight duringthetrialwithanexpectableFCR( Santosetal.,2010 ).Parvalbumin concentrations in ﬁsh muscle were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit which is designed f or cod ﬁsh.
After a blast search (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), 71 % of Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1844 Schrama et al. Creatine Supplementation in Gilthead Seabream identity with Sparus aurata was obtained for β-parvalbumin.Although we cannot conclude this assay to be quantitative for this species, our results show no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the parvalbumin concentration in muscle of ﬁsh fed with the diﬀerent tested diets ( Figure3).We hypothesize that creatine loadingwoulddecreasetheexpressionofparvalbumin,theref ore decreasingtheallergenicstatusofﬁsh.Accordingtoourre search outputs, creatine supplementation seems not to modulate parvalbumin expression in the muscle of gilthead seabream.These results were further validated by our comparative proteomics results and explained further down.Parvalbumin is involved in the muscular system of contraction/relaxati on and plays a role in the whole ﬁsh performance.
It was found that fastest sprinters release energy faster because of the r elease of ATP-enzyme creatine kinase ( Knight, 2012 ). Our dissonant ﬁndings may be explained by the lack of an environmental or artiﬁcial challenge (e.g., nutritional or a stressful co ndition) that could increase ﬁsh activity and energy release, hence t he parvalbumin concentration.Previous research regarding th e expression of parvalbumin in ﬁsh has been driven mainly to determine the allergenic cross-reactivity between ﬁsh spec ies (Van Do et al., 2005; Kuehn et al., 2010 ) or linked to a performance test after a stressor situation ( Knight, 2012; Seebacher and Walter, 2012 ) which can sustain the previous statement.Nevertheless, we show the ﬁrst evidences about t he eﬀect of creatine supplementation on parvalbumin modulation innon-stressedﬁsh.
Creatine is naturally present in ﬁsh muscle (200–700 mg/100g; Oehlenschläger, 2014 ), nevertheless it is important to address whether ﬁsh diet supplementation with creatine would lead to accumulation of this compound in the muscle. Using a commercially available colorimetric assay, we did not obt ain signiﬁcantdiﬀerencesbetweenconditions( Figure4).Withthese results we show that diet creatine supplementation in ﬁsh, up to 8%, does not result in an accumulation of this supplement in the muscle of these vertebrates, after 69 days of feeding.Not having similar research regarding this issue in ﬁsh, we can o nly speculate that creatine is entirely processed on daily basis ﬁ sh activity.It should be noticed that the muscle of ﬁsh fed the control diet showed insigniﬁcant higher expression of creat ine when compared to supplemented diets.
Such fact suggests that a longer trial would accentuate the diﬀerences reﬂecting the e ﬀect of supplementation, nevertheless this implicates more driven researchtoconﬁrmsuchindication. The energy reserves in ﬁsh muscle were analyzed by determiningtheglycogencontent( Figure4).Thisassaywasonly performed using the muscle from ﬁsh fed with 0% (control) and 8% supplemented creatine diets.No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were obtained between these two conditions (Student’s T- test,p>0.05), showing that creatine supplementation in the diet does not aﬀect the energy state of the ﬁsh muscle.In case diﬀerences between the highest concentration and contr ol sampleswereobserved,analysiswouldbeperformedontheothe r supplementation percentages.To the best of our knowledge, the eﬀect of creatine on glycogen content was correlated for the ﬁrst time in ﬁsh but in humans, was shown that creatine increases glycogen storage in muscle ( van Loon et al., 2004 ).

Values are means ( n=9) and error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM).No signiﬁcant differences were detected (one-way ANO VA,p>0.05 and Student’s T-test,p>0.05).In ﬁsh, the expression of creatine was reported to be positively correlated with energy demand ( Borchel et al., 2014 ) which is known to be associated with higher glycogen levels ( Silva et al., 2012b ).The level of locomotory activity in ﬁsh is recognized to be higher than in other vertebrates.
Accordin gly, several research, mainly in humans, have reported that the supplementation by creatine per seis not suﬃcient to alter muscleglycogencontentafterintenseexercise.Thesameres earch suggests that only a supplementation with creatine plus a carbohydrate is capable of sparing glycogen by decreasing the reliance on glycolysis ( Robinson et al., 1999; Roschel et al., 2010). Nevertheless, in ﬁsh this compounds mix have not been tested yet and research should be conducted to draw any ﬁrm conclusions.Metabolic Fingerprinting by FT-IR Spectroscopy Analysis of the FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectros copy) dataset shows that the biggest diﬀerences are found at 1,000 a nd 1,450 cm−1, which correspond to IR absorptions attributable to carbohydrates and lipids, respectively, ( Figure5).
In the case of carbohydrates (e.g., glycogen), the feed with 8% supplementation of creatine does not alter the hepatic glycogen reserves, since ﬁsh fed with supplemented diet showed higher Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1844 Schrama et al.

Several researches have been conducted in mammals showing that creatine supplementation does improve glucose tolerance and glycogen content, but it seems not enough to enhance the lipid proﬁle in healthy individuals ( van Loon et al., 2004; Op’t Eijnde et al., 2006; Gualano et al., 2008 ). Also, in birds, creatine supplementation showed to be more beneﬁcial in the energy metabolism by reducing the muscle glycolysis, rather than on its antioxidant activity ( Wang X.et al., 2015 ).The principal component analysis (PCA) of all spectra shows the biological variability, with somecontrol ﬁsh representing a comparable statistical proﬁle to 8% creatine supplemented ﬁsh.This spatial representation reveals how misunderstanding are the exact mechanisms underlying creatine-dependent carbohydrates and lipids proﬁles.These synergic adaptations have yet to be clariﬁed, however our results point out in the same direction as the prementioned studies.
Notwithstanding the lack of evidence s regarding the metabolic ﬁngerprinting we would suggest further studies to investigate any indirect eﬀect of creatin e supplementation on the lipid and carbohydrate proﬁle as a result of individuals being able to catabolize better the food nutrients. Such research could have important repercussions for the augment of farmed ﬁsh performance and aquaculture productivity.Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1844 Schrama et al.Creatine Supplementation in Gilthead Seabream Muscle Quality Analysis The quality of ﬁsh ﬂesh is often seen by the structure and muscle quality parameters, among others like properties of ski n, eyes, gills, and mucus.Textural analysis, provide important parametersofmusclequality,whichareindirectlycorrelat edwith pH andrigor mortis (downstream indicators of the energetic status of muscle) ( Silva et al., 2012b ).
More, both rigor mortis and muscle pH have been used as stress indicators in several ﬁsh species ( Ribas et al., 2007; Lefèvre et al., 2008; Acerete et al., 2009). pH is known to have a great eﬀect on conformation, thermal denaturation, and rheological properties of ﬁsh musc le proteins, particularly myosin ( Tadpitchayangkoon et al., 2010 ).Overall, the present study seems to indicate that creatine supplementation, maintains the energy reserves of the muscle with the enhancement of the creatine levels, with potential improvement of the ﬂesh quality.The pH measured varied between 5.0 and 6.6 over a time course of 72h as shown in Figure6.For all the time points measured, except after 48h, distinctpHbetween experimental dietswere found.Control di et revealedabasalpHof6.2( t=0)whichwassigniﬁcantlydiﬀerent from the other diets.
Then, immediately after slaughtering, supplemented diets seemed to improve energy reserves (even though the lack of diﬀerences between glycogen levels as pre- explained). In humans, creatine ingestion contributed for a higher rate of phosphocreatine re-synthesis and higher pH 30s afteranintensiveexercise( Yqueletal.,2002 )andinrats,afteran intermittent exercise, creatine loading seems to spares gly cogen content ( Roschel et al., 2010 ).Throughout storage time, pH values should decrease but our data show a constant variatio n of pH which is not reported in other studies ( Silva et al., 2012b; Matos et al., 2013 ).However, the authors state that despite this variability, ﬁsh are less stressed—indicated by the lower c ortisol levels and expressed higher pH after 8h of slaughtering.
Also, it seemsthathigherthesupplementation,higherthemuscleener gy reserves, higher the pH and faster the rigor mortis (at least to someextent).Suchconditionisknown,aspre-mentioned,lin ked with better texture and ﬁsh muscle quality. In accordance, a previous study, reported a correlation between higher energy reserves in muscle with a higher pH at time of death ( Silva et al., 2012b).Regarding rigor mortis outputs, after 6h, the majority of the ﬁsh showed such condition value higher than 80% ( Figure7).Giltheadseabreamwithcreatinesupplementationshowsatypic al evolutionof rigormortis ,althoughsomeslightdiﬀerencescanbe observedafter4,8,and24hforthe5%supplementationshowing lessrigorcompared to the other creatine supplementation concentrations (one-way ANOVA followed by post-hocTukey,p <0.05).Thereasonsforsuchhigh“resistance”to rigorofgilthead seabream, are unknown by the authors and need to be further investigated.
After 8h, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence was observed for the 8% supplementation showing more rigorthan the control diet (one-way ANOVA followed by post-hocTukey,p<0.05). Similar studies with higher energy reserves in muscle due to glycogen supplementation showed that the rigorstatus of ﬁsh have a similar pattern regarding the rigorcontinuum with our trial(Silvaetal.,2012b ).FIGURE 6 | pH value of muscle of gilthead seabream fed supplemented die ts with creatine.Values are means ( n=9) and error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM).Different letters represent signiﬁcant di fferences (one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey,p<0.05).Time is set in hours.FIGURE 7 | Rigor mortis of gilthead seabream fed supplemented diets with creatine.Values are means ( n=12) and error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM).Different letters represent signiﬁcant diff erences (one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey,p<0.05).Time is set in hours.
Additionally, a Texture Proﬁle Analysis (TPA) using several mechanical parameters to assess the quality of the ﬁsh ﬂesh (see review from Cheng et al., 2014 ) was performed ( Table2). Brieﬂy, hardness can be deﬁned as the strength needed to compress the muscle between molars, adhesiveness is known as the stickiness of the muscle to a surface (palate and/or teeth) , springiness can be deﬁned as the ability of the muscle to return to the original shape, cohesiveness is known as the force need ed to rupture the muscle ﬁlaments and chewiness deﬁned as the energy needed to chew the muscle for swallowing ( Hyldig and Nielsen, 2001; Careche and Barroso, 2009 ).In this study an Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1844 Schrama et al.Creatine Supplementation in Gilthead Seabream TABLE 2 | Texture analysis of gilthead seabream muscle (ﬂesh) after 69 days of trial.

Nevertheless, th e available literature, mostly regarding postmortem storage and pre-slaughterstress( Suárezetal.,2005;Álvarezetal.,2008;Ayala et al., 2010 ), about ﬂesh quality are per secontradictory, since sample preparation and sample size can easily have an eﬀect on the repeatability, reliability and accuracy of texture param eters. Despite the care with sample preparation, the perception and measures of the texture are known to be diﬀerently aﬀected by chemical constituents and non-homogeneous distributio n of fat, moisture and collagen of ﬁsh ( Cheng et al., 2014 ).Overall, our results suggest that a higher sample size or possibly a longer sampling period would possibly accentuate texture diﬀerences.Higher supplementation reveals a tendenc y to better textural properties, demonstrated by higher values of the hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, and chewiness, th en suggesting evidences of enhanced muscle uptake of creatine.
However,moreresearchhastobedoneinunderstandingthero le oftextureandstructureonﬁshﬂeshquality. Proteomics The gel images of both gilthead seabream muscle proteomes of total protein extraction and sarcoplasmic fraction are presen ted inFigure8.Within the range of pH 3–7 we were able to successfully identify 127 protein spots ( TableS2).Despite thewide distribution of muscle proteins on pH above 7 recognized for seabream ( Martin-Perez et al., 2012 ), the region of interest for the majority of allergenic proteins is acid supporting the pH range selected in adequacy to the objective of this study.As so, this narrow pH was chosen to be able to get a good protein separation in the parvalbumin region, minimizing the number of overlapping spots and eliminating the usual vertical streakin g of the alkaline zone.

Fish coul d alsohaveadaptedtothedailyamountofcreatinegiveninthed iet, causing protein conformational changes masked by the increa se ofpHasresultofsupplementconcentration( Tadpitchayangkoon etal.,2010 ). Although we did not observe any signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the previous discussed analysis, we found some minor eﬀects of creatine supplementation in muscle proteome.As expected in muscle tissue proteome characterization, the majority of the identiﬁed spots are myosin, actin and tropomyosin.In case of spot 461a blast search (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) id entiﬁed myosin binding protein H.This protein is up-regulated with 2% of creatine and is important for the myosin bundles in the thic k ﬁlaments ( Silva et al., 2012a ).Moreover, beta enolase (Spot 651), a protein related with energy metabolism ( Richard et al., 2016 ) shows to be up-regulated with 2% enrichment.
Myosin light chain (spot 641) showed up-regulation in ﬁsh fed 8% creatine supplementation, supporting the idea that phosphorylation shuttling driven by creatine loading modulates contractile activity regardless the suboptimal Ca2+concentrations (akaparvalbuminconcentration).With5%creatinesupplementatio n, a creatine kinase was identiﬁed as spot 1,032. This protein belongs to the phosphotransfer network, which is important in the ATP/ADP gradients in the muscle ( Silva et al., 2012a ).Such speciﬁc outputs, to some extent support the ﬁndings in rainbow trout.The authors suggest that muscle seems to be independent of the import of creatine, instead it seems to produce creatine by itself ( Borchel et al., 2014 ).Such possibility is supported by general higher locomotor activity of ﬁsh, making it energet ically morebeneﬁcialtosynthesizecreatineattheplaceofusagein stead of shuttling.
That means, enriched creatine diets might be u sed for diﬀerent biological processes rather than only for energet ic pathways, as supported by the lack of diﬀerence in glycogen reserves.Inthecontrolﬁshtropomyosinalpha(spot497),whic h playsanimportantroleinmusclecontraction,wasup-regulated . Additionally, spot 1,062 was identiﬁed as heat shock protein 2 7 (hsp27).The hsp27 regulates the changing of actin ﬁlaments (KayhanandDuman,2010 )andactslikeachaperonincaseofcell damage(Schramaetal.,2017 ).Overall,creatinesupplementation inthedietsseemstoinﬂuencethemusclehomeostasis.Liver proteins were extracted to verify if the supplementation with creatine would aﬀect the expression of proteins in this tissue, by increasing or lowering energy reserve and/o r if lipid metabolism and stress proteins would be triggered.Thirty-six proteins, from a linear gradient of pH 4–7, with signiﬁcant expression diﬀerences were identiﬁed, as shown in Figure9 andTable4, respectively.

Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1844 Schrama et al. Creatine Supplementation in Gilthead Seabream in seabream ( Richard et al., 2016 ).Proteome analysis of control group supports the ability of these ﬁsh to activate proteins from the lipid metabolism [Apolipoprotein A (Apo- A) and 14 kDa Apo-A ( Moreira et al., 2017 )].Additionally, diﬀerently expressed proteins in this experimental diet show to be involved in the immune system [Transferrin ( Staﬀord and Belosevic, 2003 ); Fibrinogen beta chain ( Xie et al., 2009 )] and biological thermal adjustment [wap65 ( Sha et al., 2008 )].
Such proteinswereup-regulatedincontrolconditions,suggestin gthat creatinesupplementationmightinﬂuencethegeneralhealtha nd biologicalsystemandlipidmetabolismoftheseﬁsh.Althoug hthe existenceoftheseproteinsbeingindicative(tosomeextent )ofan eﬀect of creatine supplementation, our ﬁndings could be merely arbitrary and should be founded with further applied studies. Proteins involved in cell processes and/or stress responses w as shown to be up-regulated in all conditions.Nevertheless, 9 of 11 diﬀerentially expressed proteins between experimental conditions were up-regulated in liver of ﬁsh fed with creatin e supplementation ( Figure9;Table4).Speciﬁc examples are heat shock 70 kDa and heat shock cognate proteins ( Schrama et al., 2017),Peroxiredoxin( Richardetal.,2016 ),chlorideintracellular channel(Averaimoetal.,2010 ),andcytidinedeaminase( Richard et al., 2016 ) which can indicate that creatine supplementation activates biological processes to protect against any cellula r damage.
Several proteins related to the cytoskeleton were up- regulated indiﬀerently between the diﬀerent diets, therefor e indicatingthatthebiologicalprocessesrelatedwithsuchf unction are triggered in all ﬁsh and not speciﬁcally due to creatine supplementation [glial ﬁbrillary protein (spots 517 and 992), tropomyosin (spots 914 and 915), intermediate ﬁlament protein (spot 541), keratin (spots 590 and 1,072), cytochrome c oxidas e (spot 1,298) and beta enolase (spot 526)]. Three proteins relat ed with divergent metabolic processes were only up-regulated in ﬁsh subjected to enriched diets (described in Table4).To some extent, these results show that liver metabolic pathway s seem to be inﬂuenced by creatine enrichment nonetheless to further understand these changesmore investigation needs to be conducted.
CONCLUSION The ﬁndings of the present study show disparities with previous studies in mammals in which creatine loading improves muscle performance (e.g., fatigue resistance, contraction eﬃcien cy; strength gain and muscle growth). In ﬁsh, driven research is scarce but our data suggests that creatine enrichment up to 8 % doesnotseemtohaveaneﬀectinmajorbiochemicalandquality aspectsofﬁsh.Weobservedhoweverthatcortisollevelsarel ower in the highest percentage of creatine supplementation, making possible to infer about the eﬀect of creatine enrichment on ﬁsh physiologicalprimaryresponse.Notwithstandingwiththelac kof evidencesregardingtheeﬀectofcreatinesupplementationinﬁs h, our comparative proteomic studies has shown proteins involved in the energy homeostasis and muscle contraction mechanism s of this tissue.In liver the majority of proteins involved in immune system, lipid metabolism, metabolic pathways and cell processessuggeststobemodulatedbycreatinesupplementation .
Such fact endorses to our theory that supplemented creatineis not load directly in muscle but is rather shuttled to other biological tissues and processes. Moreover, our researc h does not show direct evidences pointing to a modulation of allergenicity in ﬁsh fed with creatine enriched diets.Deeper research is needed to understand the co-regulation between supplemented creatine and parvalbumin, as well as to tune creatine supplementation regarding aquaculture sustainabil ity.Hence, it is important to refer that a proper economical study should be performed to evaluate the balance between the costs of enrichment diets and how it will improve aquaculture productivity (e.g., growth, reproductive success, welfare, m uscle quality, among other).Overall, this study proves the sensibili ty of proteomics to detect changes in ﬁsh tissues (muscle and liver) submitted to enriched diets where no apparent changes were detected by standard biochemical and quality analysis .
Proteomicsishoweveranexpensivetechniqueandthereforen ot always accessible in all laboratories but being such a sensiti ve technology, it is an invaluable tool for an untargeted and unbiased assessment of the impact of exogeneous stimuli on ﬁsh metabolism. Such possibility enables approaches toward knowledge discovery which are less hypothesis-driven and mor e data-driven.Nonetheless,itshouldbetakeninmindthatth elack of information of most ﬁsh genomes databases can be the major drawback and the major reason for a low protein identiﬁcation rateinﬁsh.ETHICS STATEMENT This experiment was performed by trained scientists and following the European Directive 2010/63/EU of European Parliament and of the Council of European Union on the protection of animals used for scientiﬁc purposes.
