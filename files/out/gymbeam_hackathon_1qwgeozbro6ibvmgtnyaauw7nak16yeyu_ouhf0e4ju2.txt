Electronic searches of Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China Knowledge Network (CNKI), Wanfang database (Wanfang), and China ScienceandTechnologyJournalDatabase(VIP)wereconducted.ArandomizedcontrolledtrialofShengxueningcombined with conventional iron supplements for the treatment of anemia in pregnancy was included. x–_he quality of the included trials was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook's Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (version 5.1.0), and data analysis was performedusingRevMan5.4softwareandStata15.0statisticalsoftware.
Results.Atotalof150studiesweredetectedand17 studies withatotalof1741 caseswereﬁnallyincluded.Meta-analysisresultsshowedthat theeﬀectiveness ofShengxueningcombined withconventionaliron supplementationwas signiﬁcantlybetterthanthat ofconventional ironsupplementation alone, and the adverse eﬀects were signiﬁcantly reduced compared with that of iron supplementation alone, and various anemia indicators such as Hb, RBC, MCV, and MCHC and iron metabolism indicators such as SI and TSAT were also signiﬁcantly increased. Conclusion.x–_he eﬃcacy of the combination of Shengxuening and conventional iron supplemen- tation in the treatment of anemia in pregnancy is better than that of conventional iron supplementation alone, and theadverse eﬀects in the experimental group are much less than those in the control group, but the quality of the included studies is not high, and more high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed for further validation.
1.Introduction Anemia is a relatively common comorbidity during preg- nancy. Due to the increase in blood volume during preg-nancy and the increase in plasma more than the increase inred blood cells, the blood is diluted, also known as “phys-iological anemia” [1].Many studies have shown thatpregnant women with anemia during pregnancy are athigher risk for postpartum depression [2].Anemia during pregnancy can be harmful to both the mother and the fetus to some extent.Anemic pregnant women are less able totolerate childbirth, surgery, and are prone to hemorrhagicshock.In contrast, moderate-to-severe anemia causes theplacenta to be inadequate to meet the needs of the growingfetus, which can lead to fetal birth restriction and pretermdelivery.Iron deﬁciency anemia is the most common.Forpatients with mild-to-moderate anemia, clinical advice is totake oral iron supplements as well as to improve the diet structure and eat more iron-rich foods.
Patients with severe anemia are recommended to be treated with oral iron orintravenous iron, with small and multiple infusions ofconcentrated red bloodcellsas needed.x–_he commonlyusedclinical oral iron agents are ferrous succinate, iron poly-saccharide, and Shengxuening. Commonly used oral ironsupplementsareferroussuccinate,ironpolysaccharide,irongluconate, iron sulfate, and hematopoietin.Conventionaliron such as ferrous succinate is prone to gastrointestinaladverse eﬀects such as nausea and vomiting, constipation,anddiarrhea[3].Shengxueningisanextractofdriedfecesof silkworm moths, the main component of which is sodiumHindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2022, Article ID 1773616, 16 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/1773616 ferric chlorophyllin, which is similar in structure to heme and can directly participate in the hematopoietic processwith low incidence of adverse reactions [4].
In recent years,the combination of Chinese patent medicine and Westernmedicine iron in the treatment of anemia has becomea common practice, and clinical reports emerge one afteranother. However, the sample size of the current combi-nationdrugstudyissmalland the evidenceisinsuﬃcient.It isnecessaryforustomakeasystematicreviewoftherelated clinical studies of the combination drug, so as to providemore bases for clinical decision-making.

x–_his indicates that the combinationof Shengxuening and iron-supplementing drugs has betterclinical eﬀectiveness. 4.Discussion Current studies related to anemia in pregnancy havefocused on comparative studies of diﬀerent iron treat-ments, for example, researchers have found similar per-formance of oral iron, with parenteral preparations beingthe most eﬀective [22].New oral iron formulations havealso shown promising clinical eﬃcacy and reduced in-cidenceofadversereactions,suchasironbisglycinateandliposomal iron formulations, which have high gastroin-testinal absorption and bioavailability, as well as a lowerincidence of adverse reactions than that of conventionaloral iron formulations [23].In this special group of pa-tients with anemia during pregnancy, the medicationshould be considered in terms of patient compliance andtolerability.
Based on clinical considerations, we found that the combination of proprietary Chinese medicine with iron therapy can signiﬁcantly promote the recoveryof iron metabolism and blood parameters with a lowerincidence of adverse eﬀects than iron alone.

Its structure is similar to human heme. After oral administration, it can directly participate in the syn-thesis of human blood [24].Its absorption is not compet-itively inhibited by other divalent metal ions, does notproduce free iron, has no stimulating eﬀect on the gastro-intestinal tract, and does not cause iron accumulationpoisoning with long-termadministration, which has uniqueclinical advantages [6].In a study by Sumin Li, it was shown that the combi- nation of Shengxuening and ferrous succinate tablets hadbetter eﬃcacy, shorter recovery time of anemia index, andlessincidenceofadverseeﬀectsthanferroussuccinatetabletsalone [25].Chunhua Ji's study showed more signiﬁcanteﬃcacy and less incidence of adverse reactions withShengxuening combined with polysaccharide iron com-plexes [26].

At the same time, basic animal experiments have shown that Shengxuening can eﬀectively promote the proliferationof bone marrow erythroid progenitors and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in mice; increase the percentageof peripheral blood reticulocytes; promote the recovery oferythrocytes, hemoglobin, and reticulocytes in hemorrhagic 4.2 5.07 4.333.955.593.92 3 4.385.184.19 4.5 4.362.8 3.152.893.132.853.55 2 2.912.932.96 3.3 2.894244395050465045 100 3380854244395050464845 100 3480857.77.96.18.07.97.7 7.6 8.07.87.97.91.40 [1.09, 1.71]1.92 [1.70, 2.14]1.44 [0.69, 2.19]0.82 [0.69, 0.95]2.74 [2.52, 2.96]0.37 [0.06, 0.68] Not estimable 1.47 [1.14, 1.80]2.25 [2.07, 2.43]1.23 [0.99, 1.47]1.20 [0.98, 1.42]1.47 [1.23, 1.71] 4.23 3.28 52 52 7.9 0.95 [0.74, 1.16] 4.3 3 40 40 7.7 1.30 [0.99, 1.61] 1.43 [1.06, 1.80]Chen F 2014Study or SubgroupExperimental Control Mean Diﬀerence Chen XZ 2021 FU YH 2020Gu Y 2019Jiao ZH 2019Lin YJ 2018Liu LH 2016Liu YQ 2019Ruan SM 2018Sun LY 2020Y ang L 2021Yin QL 2015Zhang JH 2020Zhao X 2016 Total (95% Cl) Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.44; Chi2 = 387.72, df = 12 (P < 0.00001); I2 = 97% Test for overall eﬀect: Z = 7.56 (P < 0.00001)756 –2 –1 Favours [control] Favours [experimental]012755 100.0Mean 0.9 0.68 1.730.380.560.870.410.970.670.57 0.7 0.960.64 0.8SD Mean 0.5 0.311.630.290.570.62 0 0.570.620.42 0.7 0.550.46 0.6SD Total TotalWeight (%) IV , Random, 95% ClMean Diﬀerence IV , Random, 95% Cl(a) 1.74 1.91 2.05 2.19 2.41Lower CL limit Upper CL limit EstimateMeta-analysis estimates, given named study is omitted Chen F 2014 Chen XZ 2021 Fu YH 2020 Gu Y 2019 Jiao ZH 2019 Lin YJ 2018 Liu LH 2016 Liu YQ 2019 Ruan SM 2018 Sun LY 2020 Yin QL 2015 Zhang JH 2020 Zhao X 2016 (b) Figure7: Forest plot and sensitivity analysis of meta-analysis of red blood cell count.10 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine rats; and increase the serum iron content and transferrin saturation [27].
On the other hand, iron regulators are important iron homeostasis-regulating hormones that function to regulatethe imbalance of iron homeostasis in the body [28]. Undernormal physiological conditions, the expression of iron-regulated hormones in the body shows a negative feed-backrelationshipwiththelevelofironinthebody,andwheniron-regulated hormones are overexpressed, it leads to in- suﬃcient iron in the body and subsequently to anemia.It was found that Shengxuening inhibited iron-regulatoryprotein expression by blocking the JAK2/STAT3 signalingpathway [29].At the same time, Shengxuening upregulatesiron regulatory protein expression, increases the binding ofiron regulatory proteins and iron response elements, andpromotes the release of iron from the liver to supply thebody’s needs [30].
It has been found that Shengxuening attenuates mye- losuppression,increasesbonemarrowCFU-EandCFU-GMproduction, increases reticulocyte percentage, and restoreshematopoiesis in a hemorrhagic anemia model through thestem cell factor-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway [20, 31].
In summary, Shengxuening agents further improve the symptoms of anemia by promoting the bone marrow to performitshematopoieticfunction,facilitatingthereleaseof 96.8 96.898.8 90.3398.8691.69 89 97.83 91.3 93.6193.2891.5785.185.178.5 86.4289.1486.14 80 84.31 82.4 82.4182.3685.114242403927505045404433 1004242403927504845404434 1006.86.86.48.85.96.69.36.89.38.97.28.611.70 [6.31, 17.09]11.70 [6.31, 17.09] 20.30 [14.52, 26.08] 3.91 [0.10, 7.72] 9.52 [3.25, 15.79] 5.55 [–0.05, 11.15] 9.00 [5.63, 12.37] 13.52 [8.11, 18.93] 8.90 [5.49, 12.31] 11.20 [7.49, 14.91]10.92 [5.89, 15.95] 6.46 [2.55, 10.37] 97.85 84.28 85 85 8.6 13.57 [9.67, 17.47] 1.43 [1.06, 1.80]Chen F 2014Study or SubgroupExperimental Control Mean Diﬀerence Chen XZ 2021 Fei LX 2021FU YH 2020Jiao ZH 2019Lin YJ 2018Liu LH 2016Liu YQ 2019 Ruan SM 2018 Sun LY 2020Li ZH 2018 Yin QL 2015 Zhao X 2016 Total (95% Cl) Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 9.51; Chi2 = 34.47, df = 12 (P < 0.00006); I2 = 65% Test for overall eﬀect: Z = 9.51 (P < 0.00001)637 –20 –10 Favours [control] Favours [experimental]01 0 2 0636 100.0Mean 12.4 12.4 15.61 8.97 13.0714.35 9 13.21 7 9.78 11.6714.1813.02SD Mean 12.812.810.28.17 10.2914.22 8 12.96 8.5 7.869.15 14.0512.95SD Total TotalWeight (%) IV , Random, 95% ClMean Diﬀerence IV , Random, 95% Cl(a) Chen F 2014 Chen XZ 2021 Fei LX 2021 Fu YH 2020 Jiao ZH 2019 Lin LH 2016 Liu YQ 2019 Liu ZH 2018 Ruan SM 2018 Sun LY 2020 Yin QL 2015 Zhao X 2016 1.74 0.75 0.87 0.99 1.09Lower CL limit Upper CL limit EstimateMeta-analysis estimates, given named study is omitted (b) Figure8: Forest plot and sensitivity analysis of meta-analysis of mean red blood cell volume.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 11 iron from the liver and providing an eﬀective source of iron for the hematopoietic system.
