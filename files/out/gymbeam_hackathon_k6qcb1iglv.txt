However, the contribution of individual bacterial strains and their metabolites to childhood NAFLD pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Herein, the critical bacteria in children with obesity accompanied by NAFLD were identified by microbiome analysis.Bacteria abundant in the NAFLD group were systematically assessed for their lipogenic effects.The underlying mechanisms and microbial- derived metabolites in NAFLD pathogenesis were investigated using multi-omics and LC-MS/MS analysis.The roles of the crucial metabolite in NAFLD were validated in vitro and in vivo as well as in an additional cohort.The results showed that Enterococcus spp.was enriched in children with obesity and NAFLD.The patient-derived Enterococcus faecium B6 (E.faecium B6) significantly contributed to NAFLD symptoms in mice.E.faecium B6 produced a crucial bioactive metabolite, tyramine, which probably activated PPAR-γ, leading to lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver.
Moreover, these findings were successfully validated in an additional cohort. This pioneering study elucidated the important functions of cultivated E.faecium B6 and its bioactive metabolite (tyramine) in exacerbating NAFLD.These findings advance the comprehen - sive understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis and provide new insights for the development of microbe/metabolite-based therapeutic strategies.

The pathogenesis of NAFLD is now recognized to be more complex than the traditional “two-hit hypothesis”, and the precise mechanisms underly - ing NAFLD remain largely unknown.7–9 Accumulating evidence suggests that gut micro - biota plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of childhood NAFLD, although the data are not always consistent.10–14 Notably, obesity may be a confounding factor that hinders the real relation - ship between gut microbiota and NAFLD, since it is both related to NAFLD and gut microbiota.15,16 However, there is a lack of published research focusing on the gut microbiota in children with obesity, accompanied with or without NAFLD, which hinders our understanding of the actual role of the gut microbiota in this population.17 Moreover, the taxonomic and functional resolution of gut microbiota has been limited to the 16S ribo- somal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing.
Most of these studies relied on observational data without biological validation, thereby precluding causal inference. The contribution of individual bacterial strains to NAFLD pathogenesis remains largely unknown.Advancing from correlation to causation is essential in elucidating the interaction between the gut microbiota and the host.Typically, the gut microbiota interacts with host metabolism by pro- ducing bioactive metabolites.
Recent studies have highlighted the role of gut microbiota in exacerbat - ing the progression of fatty liver disease in adults by generating endogenous alcohol.13,18 Moreover, alterations in gut microbiota have been associated with changes in circulatory metabolite levels, including trimethylamine-N-oxide, phenylacetic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactate, branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, bile acids, and short-chain fatty acids, which were closely asso- ciated with metabolic disease.19–23 Some gut microbiota could generate aromatic amines from aromatic amino acids using aromatic acid decar - boxylase enzymes.24,25 For example, tyramine is derived from tyrosine through the action of tyro- sine decarboxylase found in several microbial taxa.26,27 The genes encoding tyrosine decarboxy - lase, such as tyrDC, tyrP, mfnA, adcA, are typically organized in an operon.28–30 Recent studies sug- gested that tyramine concentrations were signifi - cantly correlated with biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk factors and the pro- inflammatory state of metabolic syndrome.31 In addition, a preclinical study indicated that tyra- mine might induce liver damage and adversely affect life conservation.32 However, the causal rela- tionship between specific species/strains and their derived metabolites in NAFLD pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, especially in children.
In this study, we aimed to investigate the roles of gut microbiota and derived metabolites in NAFLD development among children with obesity. Firstly, we identified and cultivated key taxa associated with NAFLD development.Then, in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to elucidate the pathogenic effects and underlying mechanisms linking the natural Enterococcus faecium B6 (E.faecium B6) to NAFLD.Furthermore, the cru- cial bioactive metabolite of E.faecium B6 was iden - tified, and its pathogenic mechanisms in NAFLD progression were investigated in vitro and in vivo.Furthermore, the results were validated in an inde - pendent cohort.Hence, we identified a novel gut commensal strain and its bioactive metabolite con- tributing to NAFLD, as well as elucidating the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of these com - positional factors involved in the disease.
These findings present critical evidence for host-microbe interactions and provide promising intervention targets for addressing NAFLD in children. Results Microbiome signatures of children with obesity accompanied by NAFLD A total of 156 children with obesity aged 6–18 years were enrolled as the discovery cohort, including 78 children with obesity accompanied by NAFLD (the NAFLD group) and 78 children with simple obesity2 J.WEI ET AL.(the control group).No significant differences were observed between the two groups, except for sev- eral NAFLD-associated clinical phenomics para - meters (Table 1).The sequencing depth and quality control of each sample met the expected standards, providing high-quality data for micro - biome analysis (Figure S1).The total number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was signifi - cantly decreased in the NAFLD group compared to the control group (Figure S1).
A significantly lower microbiota α-diversity (observed, chao1, shannon, and ACE diversity indexes) was observed in the NAFLD group than that of the control group (Figure 1a). The weighted UniFrac distances in principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) results showed a significant compositional difference in the microbiota β-diversity between the two groups (Figure 1b).The phylum level analysis detected a lower rela- tive abundance of Firmicutes, and a higher abun - dance of Proteobacteria in the NAFLD group compared to the control group (Figure S2).The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) ana- lysis suggested that Enterococcus , Escherichia , Klebsiella , Dialister , and Enterobacter have higher abundance in the NAFLD group, while Faecalibacterium , Eubacterium_eligens_group , Roseburia , Fusicatenibacter , Clostridium , Coprococcus , and parasutterella have higher abun - dance in the control group (Figure 1c).
The relative abundance of these genera consistently showed a significant difference between the NAFLD group and the control group (Figure 1d, S2). Moreover, the abundance of these genera, except for Eubacterium_eligens_group , was correlated with at least one of the typical clinical indicators of NAFLD (Figure 1e).Correlation analysis between the differential taxa and NAFLD clinical indicators also emphasized the significant associa - tion of Enterococcus with serum TC, TG, HDL-c, LDL-c, AST, and ALT levels (Figure 1e).More specifically, Enterococcus appeared to have linear correlations with the levels of serum ALT, AST, TG, and TC (Figure 1f).Therefore, we speculated that the Enterococcus genus might serve as a driver in the progression of NAFLD.Data were expressed as mean ± standard devia - tion (SD) or median (interquartile range), and P Value was determined by t-test or mann- whitney U.BMI: body mass index; SBP, systolicTable 1.Characteristics of the participants.

faecium B6 colonization promoted NAFLD development in mice Following the clues illustrated by the microbiome discoveries from the case-control study, we further explored the specific strains and causal relationship of the Enterococcus genus in inducting NAFLD. We isolated a series of bacterial strains from children with obesity accompanied by NAFLD using cul- turomics, as depicted in Figure 2a.Briefly, we screened the lipogenic effects of each bacterial strain from these isolates belonging to the Enterococcus genus in vitro.We noted E.faecium B6 showed prominent lipid-increasing activities, which significantly promoted lipid accumulation in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2) (Figure S3).To ascertain the role of E.faecium B6 in NAFLD development under natural non-disease condi - tions, we conducted animal experiments as illu- strated in Figure 2b.
Briefly, mice were randomly assigned to four groups: the normal chow diet with saline gavage (the NCD group), the normal chow diet with E. faecium B6 gavage (the NCD+B6 group), the high-fat diet with saline gavage (the HFD group), and the high-fat diet with E.faecium B6 gavage (the HFD+B6 group), and the duration was 12 weeks.As expected, the E.faecium B6 was successfully colonized in mice (Figure S4).Body weights were significantly higher in the HFD group than in the NCD group, but no significant difference was observed between the NCD+B6 group and the NCD group, as well as between the HFD+B6 group and the HFD group (Figure 2c).E.faecium B6 seemed to have no effect on body weight, which was consistent with microbiome analysis that the association of Enterococcus and BMI was not statistically significant (Table 1, Figure 1e).
The liver index, histological evaluations (steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning), and NAFLD activity score (NAS) were significantly increased in the normal chow diet with E. faecium B6 gavage mice (the NCD+B6 group) compared to the NCD group, and in the high-fat diet with E.faecium B6 gavage (the HFD+B6 group) com - pared to the HFD group (Figure 2d, e).Meanwhile, histopathological analysis using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), oil red O (ORO), and masson stain - ing showed that colonization of E.faecium B6 promoted hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, demonstrating experimental NAFLD symptoms (Figure 2f).Additionally, serum and hepatic ALT, AST, TG, TC, and LDL-c levels were significantly elevated in mice administered E.faecium B6 than those control mice, while the HDL-c level showed an opposite trend (Figure 2g, h).Together, these results demonstrated that colo- nization of E.faecium B6 promoted NAFLD devel - opment in mice.E.
faecium B6 colonization affected the hepatic transcriptomes To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of E. faecium B6-induced NAFLD, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the liver tissues of mice.A total of 209 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the NCD+B6 group compared to the NCD group, with 125 genes up- regulated and 84 genes down-regulated (Figure 3a).Similarly, in the HFD+B6 group compared to the HFD group, 459 DEGs were identified, including 370 up-regulated and 89 down-regulated genes (Figure 3a).Hierarchical cluster analysis of DEGs showed roughly consistent patterns among the individual samples within each group (Figure 3b).When focusing on the specific DEGs involved in lipid metabolism, a clear pattern emerged.Genes related to hepatic synthetic, transportation, and excretory functions, such as Acsl1 , Acsl4 , Fasn , Fmo3 , Ugt1a9 , Plin4 , Plin5 , Cyp7a1 , Cyp2b10 , were significantly changed under the influence of E.faecium B6 (Figure 3c).
The qPCR analysis suc- cessfully confirmed the expression of these genes in liver tissues (Figure 3d), thus confirming the relia - bility of the transcriptomic data. Based on the DEGs profiles, we then explored the gene ontology (GO) database to gain further insights into the biological processes associated with these DEGs (Figure S5).Furthermore, the Kyoto EncyclopediaGUT MICROBES 5 Figure 2.Colonization of E.faecium B6 promoted NAFLD symptoms in mice.(a) Schematic diagram of the isolation, identification, and screening of gut bacterial strain with lipogenic effects.(b) The procedure of mice experiments.(c) Changes in body weight among the NCD, NCD+B6, HFD, and HFD+B6 groups during 12 weeks.(d) Quantification of the liver index in mice.(e) Quantification of the steatosis score, inflammation score, ballooning score, and NAFLD activity score in mice.(f) Representative images of fixed liver sections 6 J.WEI ET AL.
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identified several significantly altered signaling pathways (Figure 3e, f). E.faecium B6 colonization may induce transcriptional reprogramming in the liver.In particular, common alternations in known pathways related to lipid metabolism, inflamma - tion, and fibrosis, such as PPAR signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, Linoleic acid metabolism, might emerge as the major roles in this process.E.faecium B6 played an impact on the PPAR signaling pathway We next investigated the expression levels of genes involved in the PPAR signaling pathway based on the clues provided by transcriptomic analysis results.PPAR signaling pathway was mainly involved in lipid metabolism (KEGG map03320).
Transcriptomic analysis suggested that the expres - sion of genes encoding peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) and the cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) was significantly up- regulated in the E. faecium B6 colonization group compared to the control group, while the expres - sion of gene encoding carnitine palmitoyltransfer - ase 1A (CPT-1α) was significantly down-regulated.The expression of these genes was successfully vali- dated by qRT-PCR results (Figure 4a).Furthermore, western blot analysis confirmed the up-regulation of PPAR-γ and its target CD36 and the down-regulation of CPT-1α at the protein level (Figure 4b, c).In addition, PPARs are a family of ligand-regulated nuclear receptors, including PPAR-α, PPAR-β, and PPAR-γ, which also func - tion as transcription factors.We found that the Ppar-α and Ppar-β mRNA levels had no significant changes between the E.faecium B6 colonization group and the control group (Figure S6).
Moreover, the nuclear receptor superfamily mem - bers involved in the regulation of metabolic enzymes, such as liver X receptor (LXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), and pregnane X receptor (PXR), which acted as the downstream target of CD36 , were also examined (Figure S6). We noted that PPAR- γ and its interacting protein retinoid X receptor (RXR) exhibited the most significant alterations (Figure S6).Furthermore, IHC staining confirmed that liver PPAR-γ expression increased markedly in the E.faecium B6 colonization group compared to the control group (Figure 4d).These findings suggested that E.faecium B6 colonization probably affected the PPAR signaling pathway.The activa - tion of PPAR-γ, instead of LXR, FXR, AHR, and PXR, was more likely to play a crucial impact on the pathogenic role of E.faecium B6 in NAFLD.E.faecium B6 facilitated inflammation and fibrosis progression in liver Meanwhile, E.
faecium B6 colonization also affected the inflammatory response and the TGF- beta signaling pathway. The qPCR analyses con- firmed the significant up-regulation of key genes related to the TGF-beta signaling pathway, includ - ing genes encoding smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), in the livers of mice administrated with E.faecium B6 compared to the control group (Figure 4a).The protein levels of α-SMA and TGF-β were increased in the liver of the E.faecium B6 colonization group compared to the control group, as demonstrated by western blot and IHC analysis (Figure 4b–d ).The expression change of these fibrosis markers (α- SMA and TGF-β) was consistent with the masson staining results, which showed an increased col- lagen deposition in the liver (Figure 2f).
Moreover, the expression of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response, including genes encod - ing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleu - kin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), were significantly up-regulated in the liver of mice admi - nistrated with E. faecium B6 compared to the con- trol group (Figure 4a).The protein expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β was aligned with the mRNA analysis results (Figure 4b–d ).Moreover, the liver and serum concentrations of these secre - tory pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly with H&E, ORO, and masson staining, respectively.Magnification, × 200, the scale bar, 150 μm.(g-h) the concentrations of (g) serum and (h) hepatic ALT, AST, TG, TC, LDL-c, and HDL-c.N=8 per group, error bars represented the mean ± SD, *p < .05, **p < .01.GUT MICROBES 7 Figure 3.Transcriptomic analysis of liver tissues from the NCD, NCD+B6, HFD, and HFD+B6 groups.(a) Volcano plot of the DEGs distribution.Each dot represented a DEG.

Subsequently, the PPI network analysis showed that PPAR-γ appeared to occupy a pivotal position in linking lipid metabolism to inflammation and fibrogenesis (Figure 4f). Collectively, E.faecium B6 might induce lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrogenesis in the liver, and PPAR-γ probably played a vital role in this process.E.faecium B6 colonization induced specific metabolomic signatures To further explore the metabolic mechanisms of E.faecium B6 contributed to NAFLD, we per- formed a widely untargeted metabolomics analysis of serum samples from mice using liquid chroma - tography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).A total of 1380 metabolites were identified and categorized into 11 SuperClass cate- gories (Figure S8).Furthermore, the orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS- DA) score plots separated the metabolite profiles among the NCD, NCD+B6, HFD, and HFD+B6 groups (Figure 5a).
Also, the 7-fold cross- validation tests indicated that the OPLS-DA model was not overfitting and was reliable in screening differential metabolites (Table S1). Furthermore, we observed 30 significantly up- regulated metabolites and 85 significantly down- regulated metabolites in the NCD+B6 group com - pared to the NCD group, as well as 18 significantly up-regulated metabolites and 45 significantly down-regulated metabolites in the HFD+B6 group compared to the HFD group (Figure 5b).Moreover, pathway analysis showed that E.faecium B6 colonization significantly influenced the metabolic process of the host, especially impacting the amino acid metabolism, carbon metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism (Figure 5c).Furthermore, we found increased con- centrations of metabolites such as tyramine, myr- istic acid, and bergaptol, while decreased concentrations of pentadecanoic acid, g-guanidi - nobutyrate, and isosafrole in the E.
faecium B6 colonization groups compared to the control groups (Figure 5d, e, S9). Notably, serum tyramine exhibited the most significant change, with a higher concentration in the NCD+B6 group and the HFD +B6 group compared to their respective control groups (Figure 5e).Moreover, the targeted quanti - tative analysis further confirmed the presence and higher concentration of serum and hepatic tyra- mine in the E.faecium B6 colonization groups (Figure 5f).Therefore, tyramine was closely related to E.faecium B6, and it might be a crucial metabo - lite in the development of NAFLD.Metabolites worked as messengers in NAFLD development Microbiota-derived metabolites are vital mediators in host-commensal interactions.To better under - stand the bridging role of small molecules in the gut-liver axis and investigate the biological pro- cesses influenced by E.faecium B6 and its metabo - lites, we performed an integrative analysis of the metabolomics and transcriptomics data.
As shown in Figure S10, tyramine, bergaptol, and isosafrole were the top 3 metabolites most closely associated with various genes, while Il-6, Il-1β , and Tnf-α were the top 3 genes most closely associated with various metabolites. Moreover, network association analy - sis revealed significantly positive correlations between tyramine and the mRNA level of Ppar-γ , Cd36 , α-Sma , Tgf-β , Tnf-α , Il-6, and Il-1β , but negative correlation with the mRNA level of Cpt- 1α (Figure S10A).Meanwhile, a dose-response relationship existed between tyramine level and Ppar-γ , Cd36 , Tgf-β , Tnf-α , and Il-6 gene expres - sion (Figure S10B).Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in serum TG levels, an impor - tant index for NAFLD diagnosis, in response to tyramine content (Figure S10C).Additionally, our findings confirmed a significant elevation in serum tyramine levels in response to the abundance of E.faecium B6 (Figure S10D).

faecium B6 might be attributed to the effects of tyramine on lipid metabolism and inflammatory response. Tyramine was an important bioactive metabolite of E.faecium B6 To further investigate if tyramine was derived from E.faecium B6, we performed a fermentation of E.faecium B6 on a preparative scale and success - fully identified tyramine (m/z = 138.09176 in posi- tive mode) based on the mass spectrometry analysis (Figure 6a, b).Subsequently, we confirmed that the concentration of tyramine was 100-fold higher in the cell-free supernatant (CFS) from the fermentation extracts compared to E.faecium B6 cells, and 30-fold higher compared to the sterility BHI medium, respectively (Figure 6c).Notably, tyramine (with a retention time of approximately 10.06 min) was not detected in the CFS of E.faecium B28 (Figure 6d).E.faecium B28 was an isolated strain that couldn’t induce NAFLD (Figure S11).
To gain further insights into the molecular basis of tyramine production, we assembled the whole-genome sequences of E. faecium B6 and E.faecium B28, and annotated their functions, respectively.We then conducted a comparative genome analysis analysis to identify the specific role of E.faecium B6.The unique genomes of strain B6 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, membrane transport, and lipid metabolism, imply - ing the specific cellular activities of E.faecium B6 (Figure S12).Moreover, we noted a gene encoding tyrosine decarboxylase (EC:4.1.1.25, mfnA ) involved in the tyramine-forming reaction (R00736: C00082 → C00483 + C00011) existed in the genome of E.faecium B6.Additionally, we successfully detected the presence of the mfnA gene in the genome of E.faecium B6, while it was absent in the genome of E.faecium B28 (Figure 6e).
Furthermore, we quantitatively measured the abundance of the mfnA gene using qPCR in fecal samples of mice, which indicated that the abun - dance of the mfnA gene was higher in the E. faecium B6 administration group than in the control group (Figure 6f).Consistent with this, the concentration of fecal tyramine was signifi - cantly increased in the E.faecium B6 colonization group compared to the control group (Figure 6g).Importantly, the serum and hepatic tyramine levels were also higher in the E.faecium B6 colonization group than in the control group (Figure 5e, f).Meanwhile, the levels of mfnA gene and tyramine were higher in the HFD group than in the NCD group, suggesting that HFD was likely to induce the overgrowth of E.faecium B6 in gut microbiota (Figure 6f, g, S4).These findings suggested that E.faecium B6 might possess some specific func - tions that were responsible for tyramine production.
Tyramine up-regulated the transcription of PPAR-γ Furthermore, we performed in vitro experiments on human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2) and human normal hepatocyte cell lines (THLE3) to investigate the important function and molecular mechanisms of tyramine in NAFLD development. Tyramine didn’t cause severe cyto- toxicity at concentrations lower than 100 μM, with an IC50 of 211.8 and 131.3 μM toward HepG2 and THLE3 cell lines, respectively (Figure S13).Then 0 µM, 5 µM, 25 µM, and 50 µM of tyramine were further applied to explore their roles.Tyramine significantly increased the intracellular levels of TG, TC, LDL-c, AST, and ALT, while decreasing the concentration of HDL-c in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 7h,i).To evaluate the transcrip - tional activity of PPAR -γ, we measured the expres - sion levels of PPAR -γ and its target genes.
Tyramine significantly regulated the expression of PPAR-γ and its target genes involved in lipid meta - bolism (CD36, CPT-1α ), inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β ), and fibrosis (α-SMA, TGF- β) (Figure 7j,k).

In addition, molecular docking analysis revealed that tyramine bound to the active binding pocket of human PPAR-γ, and many residues of PPAR-γ were involved in the process (Figure S14). These findings confirmed that tyramine could effectively activate PPAR-γ, which potentially affected lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, and fibrosis in the liver, thus promoting NAFLD development.Tyramine effectively promoted NAFLD in mice We further assessed the lipogenic effect of tyramine in NAFLD development through mice experiments (Figure 7a).Consistent with the E.faecium B6 colonization, the body weights were significantly higher in the HFD group than in the NCD group, but showed no significant change among the tyr- amine-treatment and control groups (Figure 7b).E.faecium B6 and tyramine might not influence the weight of mice.
The liver index, steatosis score, inflammation score, and NAFLD activity score were significantly increased in the NCD+Tyr group compared to the NCD group, and in the HFD+Tyr group compared to the HFD group (Figure 7c,d). Histopathological evaluations clearly showed that the degrees of lipid degeneration, inflammation, and fibrosis were significantly aggravated upon tyramine treatment (Figure 7e).Additionally, hepatic ALT, AST, TG, TC, and LDL- c levels were increased, while the HDL-c level was decreased in the tyramine-treatment group than the control group (Figure 7f).All these results indicated that tyramine could effectively facilitate NAFLD development in mice.In addition, the expression of crucial genes related to the PPAR signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and inflammatory response were evaluated.
Tyramine remarkably up-regulated the relative mRNA levels of Ppar-γ and it targeted genes involved in lipid metabolism (Cd36 , Cpt-1α ), inflammatory response (Tnf-α, Il-6, Il-1β ), and fibrosis (α-Sma, Tgf-β ) (Figure 7g–i ). Moreover, we confirmed the transcriptional activity of PPAR-γ with the PPAR-γ transcriptional activity kit, which showed that tyramine promoted the transcriptional activity of PPAR-γ in mice livers (Figure 7j).Consistently, the expressions of PPAR-γ, CD36, CPT-1α, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, α- SMA, and TGF-β protein levels from mice livers were successfully determined by ELISA analysis (Figure 7k–m ).Collectively, E.faecium B6- derived the bioactive metabolite, tyramine, could promote lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrogenesis in the liver.The stimulation of PPAR-γ might play a crucial impact on the process and finally contribute to NAFLD development.Validation of E.
faecium B6 and tyramine levels in an additional independent cohort The above results showed that E. faecium B6 and its bioactive metabolite tyramine were important in NAFLD development.We further corroborated our findings in an additional independent valida - tion cohort consisting of 123 children with obesity accompanied by NAFLD and 123 controls.The characteristics of these 246 subjects are shown in Table S2.The levels of E.faecium B6, tyramine- producing gene (mfnA ), and tyramine were higher in the NAFLD groups than in the control groups (Figure 8a).Moreover, the concentrations of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) were significantly higher in the NAFLD groups than in the control groups (Figure 8b).Furthermore, the correlation analysis showed that the levels of E.faecium B6, mfnA gene, and tyramine were posi- tively correlated to fatty liver indexes (including Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography system (UHPLC) analysis of the tyramine from E.faecium B6 and E.

However, the mechanistic role of the individual gut bacterial strain and its metabolite in triggering NAFLD, especially in children, remains poorly understood. In this study, we observed a higher abundance of the Enterococcus genus in fecal samples of children in the NAFLD group than in the control group.We further iden - tified a specific strain E.faecium B6, capable of inducing NAFLD-related symptoms in mice, pro- viding the first evidence of its causal role in NAFLD development.Moreover, E.faecium B6 might contribute to NAFLD by producing the bioactive metabolite tyramine.Tyramine probably interacted with PPAR-γ, leading to lipid metabo - lism disorder, inflammatory injury, and fibrogen - esis in the liver.Furthermore, the findings were validated in an additional cohort.This pioneering study sheds light on the causal roles and molecular mechanisms underlying the increased abundance of E.faecium B6 in NAFLD development.
Gut microbiome analysis in this study showed that the relative abundance of the Enterococcus (p_Firmicutes; f_Enterococcaceae; g_Enterococcus ) was significantly up-regulated in children with obesity accompanied by NAFLD, suggesting a positive association between Enterococcus and NAFLD phenotype.
However, it is worth noting that previous reports on the asso- ciation between Enterococcus and NAFLD develop - ment have yielded inconsistent results.33–36 These discrepancies can be attributed, at least in part, to factors such as age, sex, geography, race/ethnicity, genetics, local dietary habits, and lifestyle.37–39 Besides, the evidence linking gut microbiota and childhood NAFLD is limited, and often character - ized by small sample sizes and a lack of well- characterized participants.40–42 Notably, obesity is both related to NAFLD and gut dysbiosis, making it challenging to determine whether altered micro - bial species or obesity itself promotes the exacer - bation of NAFLD.43,44 To address this issue, our study focused specifically on investigating the fecal microbial profiles of children with obesity accom - panied with or without NAFLD.
By ensuring that participants had comparable characteristics, we minimized confounding factors and attained pre- cise identification of specific taxa associated with NAFLD symptoms. To further explore the association and causality between Enterococcus and NAFLD, we conducted a batch screening of Enterococcus species/strains with lipogenic effects according to microbiome analysis.We found E.faecium B6 significantly con- tributed to lipid accumulation in cells and mice, consistent with the characteristic feature of NAFLD.45,46 Recently studies have identified sev- eral bacteria capable of inducing NAFLD in mice/ rats, including Klebsiella pneumonia W14 and TH1, Enterobacter cloacae B29, Escherichia fergu - sonii strain ATCC 35,469, Bilophila wadsworthia ATCC 49,260, and Porphyromonas gingivalis .18,47– 50 However, few strains have been precisely isolated from humans with NAFLD, especially in children.Moreover, we found the lipogenic effects were spe- cific to the E.
faecium B6 strain, since other Enterococcus species isolated from the NAFLD group did not exhibit the same effects. It has been recognized that even strains of the same genus or species might exhibit different impacts and mechanisms on the liver.51 For instance, some strains belonging to Enterococcus have been shown to significantly reduce obesity, improve hepatic steatosis, and alleviate liver mRNA levels of Ppar-γ and its targeted genes involved in (g) lipid metabolism (Ppar-γ, Cd36 , cpt-1α ), (h) inflammatory response (tnf-α, il-6, il-1β ), and (i) fibrosis (α-sma, tgf-β ).(j) The transcriptional activity of PPAR-γ in mice livers was measured with the PPAR -γ transcription factor assay kit.(k-m) the concentrations of hepatic PPAR-γ and proteins involved in (k) lipid metabolism (PPAR-γ, CD36, CPT-1α), (l) inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β), and (m) fibrosis (α-SMA, TGF-β) based on ELISA analysis.16 J.WEI ET AL.
inflammation,33,52,53 but some strains were regarded as opportunistic pathogens contributing to liver damage and fibrosis.54–56 The heterogeneity of these results suggested that the metabolic cap- abilities of strains within the Enterococcus genus largely determined their roles. Thus, studies on the role of gut microbiota in disease should narrow their focus to the strain level.This study is the first to investigate the roles of E.faecium B6 isolated from children with obesity accompanied by NAFLD in liver disease.To gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying E.faecium B6-induced NAFLD, we integratively analyzed the transcrip - tomic and metabolomic data.We recognized the involvement of hepatic PPAR-γ and its target genes in the E.faecium B6-induced NAFLD.
PPAR-γ, a vital ligand-activated receptor in the PPAR sig- naling pathway, emerges as a critical player in metabolism and hepatic steatosis.57,58 The expression of PPAR-γ and its downstream genes are closely related to the progression of NAFLD. In both human and experimental animal models of NAFLD, PPAR-γ was reported to exhibit increased expression in the hepatocytes, causing hepatocyte steatosis and activating hepatic stellate cells.59–61 Moreover, CD36 and CPT-1α were crucial targets of PPAR-γ that mediate lipid metabolism, and abnormal expression of them might result in hepa - tic steatosis.62,63 In addition to its powerful lipo- genic effect, PPAR-γ had a crucial role in exacerbating inflammation and fibrosis.64 We demonstrated that the genes and proteins related to pro-inflammation and fibrosis were significantly up-regulated by E.faecium B6.
To our knowledge, inflammation was a key driver of NAFLD progres - sion and fibrosis development.8,65 Inflammatory mechanisms were involved along the entire spec - trum of NAFLD but particularly at more advanced disease stages, including fibrosis and cirrhosis Figure 8.

faecium B6 and PPAR-γ in inflammation and fibrosis, which further aggravated NAFLD. Conversely, previous research indicated that heat-killed Enterococcus faecalis EF-2001 administration might prevent lipid accumulation by inhibiting adipose PPAR-γ in the Sprague-Dawley rats.68 The inconsistent results might be due to the tissue specificity, mod - eling method, and the different genetic back - grounds of animals, as well as the specific function of bacterial strains.69,70 The important roles of Enterococcus species in PPAR-γ of mice and other models have not been explored, which could be investigated more in-depth in the future.In addition, we noted that the extent of pathologi - cal manifestations was more pronounced in the HFD+B6 group than in the NCD+B6 group, indi- cating that E.faecium B6 might facilitate the occur - rence of NAFLD in the context of an unhealthy diet.
Future studies should explore the interactions among diet, gut microbiota, and NAFLD to fully unravel the complexity of disease development. Moreover, this study identified E.faecium B6 as a producer of tyramine, and we first discovered that tyramine might interact with PPAR-γ, contri - buting to hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis.Notably, the tyramine concentration was higher in the cell-free suspension, which indicated that the tyramine was probably released to the intestines from E.faecium B6.Generally, gut microbiota may regulate metabolism in the host through the gut-liver axis, and microbial metabo - lites are crucial factors in the process.71 We specu - lated that E.faecium B6 and its tyramine might affect liver metabolism through the gut-liver axis.
Gut microbiota has the potential to generate a wide array of metabolites, while only a limited number of these metabolites have been exacted from micro - biota and linked to disease pathogenesis.18,72,73 Our findings added to the growing body of evidence highlighting the significant role of microbial meta - bolites as key mediators that interacted with host physiology and contributed to disease develop - ment. Tyramine, a biogenic amine primarily pro- duced by decarboxylase-producing spoilage microorganisms, has been previously associated with the regulation of blood pressure.74,75 Likewise, we noted that the blood pressure was higher in the NAFLD group than in the control group (Table 1, S2).Additionally, we validated that the concentration of tyramine was higher in the NAFLD group than in the control group.
Consistently, Gu et al., 2022 also suggested a significant increase of microbial-related tyramine in the cecal samples of NAFLD mice based on the metabolomic analysis, but the underlying mechan - isms have not been extensively studied.76 Notably, although the tyramine was easily oxidized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), the increased produc - tion of tyramine and impaired degradation by MAO probably resulted in excessive tyramine and hepatic cirrhosis.77,78 Future studies should explore the metabolic kinetics of tyramine in the livers, especially in the context of abnormal metabolic states such as obesity. In short, tyramine and PPAR-γ activation provided a potential mechanis - tic explanation for the disruption of liver metabo - lism associated with E.faecium B6 colonization.The relationship between gut microbiota and childhood NAFLD is complex and has not been fully characterized.Most previous studies have focused on the association between gut microbiota and NAFLD in adults.
Evidence thoroughly sup- porting the hypothesis that specific patient-derived strains contribute to NAFLD has been limited. In this work, we systematically explored the functions of specific microbes in childhood NAFLD develop - ment from multiple aspects, including the discov - ery and validated cohorts, E.faecium B6 and tyramine treatment animal experiments, different hepatocyte experiments, as well as multi-omic ana- lysis and molecular docking.We identified E.faecium B6 as a novel pathogenic microbe that probably promoted NAFLD development, repre - senting the first report of its kind.Moreover, we first demonstrated that E.faecium B6 probably triggered NAFLD via tyramine, which led to the activation of the PPAR-γ.Furthermore, similar findings were validated in a validation cohort.This study comprehensively uncovered a causal link between gut E.faecium B6 and NAFLD, and provided a critical basis for the underlying mechanisms of gut microbiota in NAFLD.
There were several limitations in this work. We found that there were some bacteria decreased in the18 J.WEI ET AL.NAFLD group and negatively correlated with NAFLD parameters, such as Faecalibacterium , Roseburia , and Coprococcus , which were consistent with previous reports in adults.79–81 The beneficial bacteria that decreased in children with NAFLD might also contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and the roles of these bacteria in NAFLD should be explored in the future.Moreover, the role of E.faecium B6 and tyramine in NAFLD development could be evaluated with additional animal models, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of their effects.We only investigate the roles of bioactive tyramine in the present study, the impacts of other metabolites and factors on such disease warrant systematic investigations.
In addition, future longitudinal and longer-term follow-up studies are required to strengthen our claims and provide a more compre - hensive understanding of the disease. Conclusions In summary, we identified E.faecium B6 as a potentially novel pathogenic strain promoting NAFLD development in children.E.faecium B6- derived bioactive metabolite, tyramine, could play an impact on hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis progression, which promote NAFLD development.These results suggested a causal asso- ciation of E.faecium B6 and tyramine with NAFLD.This study highlighted the host-microbe interactions and provided new insights for gut microbiota management in NAFLD or related metabolic disorders.Materials and methods Human studies Children with obesity aged 6–18 years were recruited in Hunan Children’s Hospital (Hunan, China), from July 2019 to October 2020 (discovery cohort) and January 2021 to April 2022 (validation cohort).
The diagnostic criteria for NAFLD were evaluated according to the expert consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD in Children (2018) issued by the Endocrine Genetics and Metabolism Group, Pediatrics Branch of the Chinese Medical Association.82 The details of inclusion and exclusion criteria were described in Supplementary materials. Children with obesity meeting the criteria for NAFLD were categorized into the NAFLD group, and children without NAFLD matched by age, sex, and BMI were set as the control group.The studies were approved by the Xiangya School of Public Health Central South University Ethics Research Committee (XYGW- 2018-04, XYGW-2021-19) and the Hunan Children’s Hospital Ethics Research Committee (HCHLL-2019-12).All procedures were underta - ken in accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration.Written informed consents were obtained from all participants or their legal guardians/next of kin.
The details of anthropo - metric and demographic measurements, sample collection, and clinical laboratory measurements were described in Supplementary materials. In total, 156 children with obesity were enrolled in the discovery cohort for microbiome analysis, and 246 children with obesity were enrolled in the independent validation cohort.Rigorous quality control procedures resulted in final analyses of the discovery and validation cohorts.Bacteria culture Bacterial strains were isolated and cultured from fecal samples of children with obesity accompanied by NAFLD using culturomic analysis, as previously reported.83 In brief, the fresh fecal samples were suspended and homogenized in a sterile phos - phate-buffered solution (PBS, pH 7.0), and then the mixtures were diluted and seeded in a series of agar plates with different mediums for anaerobic culturing.
A single colony was picked out, and the purified isolates were identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes using the 27F/1492 R primers. The isolates classified as Enterococcus spp.(such as E.faecium , E.faecalis , E.durans , E.lactis , and E.huaxiensis ) were selected for further screening of their lipogenic effects, and we found E.faecium B6 showed great potential in promoting lipid accu - mulation in cells.Unless otherwise stated, Enterococcus strains were cultured in Brian Heart Infusion medium (BHI, Oxoid, USA) for 24 h, within an anaerobic station (Longyue LAI-3T, Shanghai, China) maintained under an atmosphere consisting of 5% hydrogen, 10% carbon dioxide,GUT MICROBES 19 and 85% nitrogen.Furthermore, whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis were performed to identify the strains and their functions, and the detailed methods are shown in the Supplementary materials.
Animal experiments The animal experiments were approved by the Laboratory Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee and adhered to the Animal Ethics Statement of Central South University (XMSB-2022–0027). Healthy specific-pathogen- free (SPF) C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Hunan SJA Laboratory Animal Co.Ltd.(Changsha, China).Male mice aged 3–4 weeks at the beginning of the study were housed in an SPF environment with controlled conditions (12-h light/12-h dark cycle at 24 ± 2°C and 40–60% humidity).Throughout the study, mice were given ad libitum access to food and filtered water.To investigate the functions of gut bacterial E.faecium B6 in vivo, we randomly assigned mice to four groups: the normal chow diet with saline gavage (the NCD group), the normal chow diet with E.faecium B6 gavage (the NCD+B6 group), the high-fat diet with saline gavage (the HFD group), and the high-fat diet with E.faecium B6 gavage (the HFD+B6 group).
The high-fat diet contained 60% kcal from fat, 20% kcal from carbo - hydrates, and 20% kcal from proteins. In the NCD +B6 and HFD+B6 groups, mice were orally admi - nistered with 200 μL of saline containing 3 × 109 CFU/mL of E.faecium B6 every two days by gavage.Correspondingly, mice in the NCD and HFD groups received 200 μL of sterile saline.Body weight and food intake were monitored weekly.At the end of the 12 weeks, all mice were fasted overnight and euthanized, The fecal samples, serum samples, and liver tissues were collected for further analysis.To assess the lipogenic effect of tyramine in vivo, male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups: the normal chow diet with saline gavage (the NCD group), the normal chow diet with tyramine gavage (the NCD+Tyr group), the high-fat diet with saline gavage (the HFD group), and the high-fat diet with tyra- mine gavage (the HFD+Tyr group).
The high- fat diet contained 60% kcal from fat, 20% kcal from carbohydrates, and 20% kcal from pro- teins. In the NCD+Tyr group and HFD+Tyr group, mice were gavaged with tyramine (2 mg/kg, Macklin, Shanghai, China) every two days, while the NCD and HFD groups were given an equal volume of saline for 12 weeks.At the end of the experiment, mice were fasted overnight and euthanized.The serum samples and liver tissues were collected for further analysis.A detailed description of the histopathology, biochemical assays, transcriptomic analysis, real- time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT- PCR), western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC) examination, metabolomic analysis, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spec - trometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, PPAR-γ transcrip - tional activity analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis, and mole - cular docking analysis is provided in the Supplemental materials.
Cell culture and treatments Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2) and normal liver cell lines (THLE3) were cul- tured as our previous report.84 For lipid accu - mulation assay of candidate bacteria, cells were seeded in 96-well or 6-well plates containing 100 µL or 2 mL cell growth medium, respec - tively. When the confluence reached 80%, the medium was replaced with the 90% fresh cell growth medium supplemented with 10% spent culture broth filtrate or BHI medium.After incubation for 24 h, lipid accumulation was evaluated by oil red O staining (Solarbio, Beijing, China) or TG/TC quantification kit (Jiancheng, Nanjing, China) as described previously.83 For the microbial metabolites (tyr- amine) treatment experiments, cells were seeded in well plates until the confluence reached 80%, and different concentrations of tyramine were treated.The cell viability of tyramine-treatment cells was examined by a CCK8 assay kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China).
After that, the cells were treated with different concentrations of tyramine (0, 5, 25, 50 µM) for 24 h, then the cells were collected for gene and protein20 J. WEI ET AL.expression determination.All experimental con- ditions were performed in three biological replicates.Statistical analysis The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the distribution type of the clinical parameters in the subjects.Data were reported as mean ± SD or med - ian (interquartile range).Statistical significance was determined by t-test or Mann-Whitney U test in SPSS software (version 24.0, IBM Corp, USA).All experiments were repeated at least three times in animal and cell experiments, and the data were presented as mean ± SD.Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism software (version 9.0, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, USA).A post hoc Tukey test was used to conduct multiple comparisons.A significance level of p < 0.05 was considered sta- tistically significant.
Multiple testing was corrected for multi-omics analysis using the Benjamini- Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate (FDR), and a Padj <0.05 was considered statis - tically significant.
