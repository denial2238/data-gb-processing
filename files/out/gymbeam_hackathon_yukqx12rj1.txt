Objective: Toassesswhethergeneticallydeterminedhumanbloodomega-/three.tnumfa tty acids are causally associated with the risk of epilepsy outcomes.
Methods: We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis by applying summary statistics of genome-wide association stud y datasets of both exposure and outcomes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms s igniﬁcantly associated with blood omega-/three.tnum fatty acids levels were selected as i nstrumental variables to estimate the causal eﬀects on epilepsy.Five MR anal ysis methods were conducted to analyze the ﬁnal results.The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary outcome.The other MR analysis meth ods (MR-Egger,weightedmedian,simplemode,andweightedmode)we reconducted as the complement to IVW.Sensitivity analyses were also conducted t o evaluate heterogeneity and pleiotropy.
Results: Genetically predicted the increase of human blood omega-/three.tnum fatty aci ds levels was associated with a higher risk of epilepsy (OR =/one.tnum./one.tnum/six.tnum/zero.tnum, /nine.tnum/five.tnum%CI =/one.tnum./zero.tnum/five.tnum/one.tnum– /one.tnum./two.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum,P=/zero.tnum./zero.tnum/zero.tnum/three.tnum). Conclusions: This study revealed a causal relationship between blood omega- /three.tnum fatty acids and the risk of epilepsy, thus providing novel ins ights into the development mechanism of epilepsy.KEYWORDS omega-/three.tnumfatty acids, epilepsy, Mendelianrandomization, cau sal, genetically Introduction Epilepsy is a common chronic central nervous system (CNS) disorder with substantial morbidity and mortality, which is pathologically characterized by spontaneous, recurrent, and transient CNS dysfunction ( 1).
As estimated, the current prevalence of epilepsy has achieved 1% in the general population, with 80% of people with epilepsy living in low- and middle-income countries, causing a substantial ﬁnancial burden ( 2,3). Aiming to increase the life quality of patients with epilepsy, the goal of all epilepsy treatment is abolishing seizures completely while minimizing the side eﬀects ( 4).Frontiersin Neurology /zero.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.org Liang et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fneur./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/three.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum Nowadays, the most classic treatments for epilepsy are still antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and surgical intervention ( 5).Despite thecontinuousdevelopmentofAEDs,sideeﬀectsarestillobserved and more than 30% of patients with epilepsy progress to refractory epilepsy ( 5,6).
In these cases, the option is surgical intervention normallybydisconnectingratherthanremovingsomebraintissue (7). However, due to the high trauma, high cost, and narrow range of adaptation, there is an urgency to develop new adjuvant treatments,suchasdietarytherapy( 8,9).Fatty acids are hydrocarbon chains with a methyl group (– CH3) at one end of the molecule and a hydrophilic carboxylic group (–COOH) at the other end.Fatty acids can be divided into polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and saturated fatty acids (SFAs), according to the number of carbon-carbon bonds (C =C).PUFAs are fatty acids with multiple double C =C, while MUFAs have one C =C and SFAs have no C =C (10,11).The two main families of PUFAs include linoleic acid and its derivatives, the omega-6 class, and a-linolenic acid and its derivatives, the omega-3 class.
Omega- 3 fatty acids mainly consist of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are found in ﬁsh oils ( 12). As essential fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids cannot be synthesized in enough amounts by the body, and therefore they must be supplied by the diet ( 13).However, there is no consensus on the nutritional requirements of omega-3 fatty acids currently, in large part because their function is not yet fully deﬁned.Previous studies have reported the beneﬁcial eﬀects of omega-3 fatty acids in cardiovascular ( 14), inﬂammatory, and autoimmune diseases (15,16).Meanwhile, omega-3 fatty acids are considered to play antiepileptic roles by stabilizing the neuronal membrane, reducing inﬂammation, and resisting oxidative damage as the elements of neuronal membrane phospholipids ( 17–19).In diﬀerent animal models of epilepsy, omega-3 fatty acids were found to reduce seizures or raise the seizure threshold ( 20–24).
Nevertheless, the roles of omega-3 fatty acids have been inconsistent in several small sample randomized controlled trials (RCTs) ( 25–30). Given the controversialresultsandthesmallsamplesizeofthecurrentRCTs, itisnecessarytocarryoutalargersampleofRCTsorotherresearch strategies with the aim to clarify the relationship between omega-3 fattyacidsandhumanepilepsy.Mendelian randomization (MR) is a recently developed analytic method, which used genetic variants [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] as instrumental variables to mimic the random allocation in the RCT ( 31,32).In the case of the absence of reliable RCTs or embarking on new RCTs, MR is an ideal alternative research strategy to clarify the causal relationships between exposures and outcomes ( 33).In addition, MR can avoid reverse causality as genotype formation precedes disease onset and isunaﬀectedbydiseaseprogression( 34).

Findings from this work would not only help to recognize the pathophysiology underlying epilepsy, but also provide reliable evidence for establishing feasible strategies for epilepsy treatment andpreventioninclinicalpractice.
Materials and methods Data acquisition and instruments variables selection The genetic instrumentation for omega-3 was obtained from the public GWAS dataset from the International Federation of Industrial Universities Project ( https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk ), consisting of 114,999 individuals of European ancestry and containing more than twelve million SNPs. The selected SNPs must satisfy the following three criteria: ( 1) selection of SNPs that were signiﬁcantly associated with omega-3 fatty acids with a genome-wide signiﬁcance threshold of P<5×10−8; (2) removal of interference from linkage disequilibrium, setting kb =10,000 and r2<0.001, indicating that there is no linkage disequilibrium between SNPs and that the assignment between two SNPs is completely random.; ( 3) there was no interference from other potential risk factors ( 35–37).In this study, we used “R studio version 4.1.3” and “MR-PRESSO” packages to test outliers.
We set a signiﬁcance threshold of P<5.0×10−8after linkage disequilibrium pruning ( r2<0.001 within a 10,000-kilobase window) to obtain the SNPs of omega-3 fatty acids. In addition, we carried out sensitivity analysis to test whether the results of MR analysis were reliable.In the case of P>0.05, it indicated that confounding factors did not aﬀect the outcome, that is, there was no potential bias.Horizontal pleiotropy test was also used to further illustrate this conclusion.The SNPs screening process and thewholeworkﬂowofMRanalysisareshownin Figure1.Genetic datasets for generalized epilepsy (non-focal epilepsy or all types of epilepsy) were obtained from the International League Against Epilepsy Complex Consortium and included all documented cases of generalized epilepsy involving 33,446 people with a total of 3,769 epilepsy patients, containing 480,000 SNPs ( 38).
Summary statistics for the generalized epilepsy dataset are available at the website:https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/datasets/ieu-b-9/ . Two-sample MR analysis We systematically assessed the causal relationship between omega-3 fatty acids and the risk of epilepsy using a two-sample MR design.A convincing MR design should comply with three fundamentalassumptions:( 1)thereisastrongassociationbetween the IVZand the exposure factor X; ( 2) the IVZis not associated with any confounders of the exposure-outcome association; ( 3) the IVZdoes not aﬀect the outcome Yexcept possibly by association with exposure ( 39).Among them, the second and Frontiersin Neurology /zero.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org Liang et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fneur./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/three.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum FIGURE /one.tnum The ﬂowchart of the study.The whole workﬂow of MR analysis.
third assumptions are collectively known as the independence of horizontal pleiotropy, which could be tested using an array of statisticalmethods( 34). The inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, and weighted median (WM) were the main methods used for MR analysis in this study.The traditional IVW method was used as the main MR analysis to assess the causal eﬀect between omega- 3 fatty acids and epilepsy.The principle of IVW is to weigh theinverse of the variance of each IV as the weight while ensuring thatallIVsarevalid,theregressiondoesnotconsidertheintercept term, and the ﬁnal result is the weighted average of the eﬀect values of all IVs.
It is worth noting that IVW can only get correct causal estimates if the SNPs are fully consistent with the three principlesofMRstudies.Therefore,intheabsenceofheterogeneity andpleiotropy,wepreferentiallyusedtheIVWestimates( 40).The MR-Egger method diﬀers most from IVW in that the presence of Frontiersin Neurology /zero.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org Liang et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fneur./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/three.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum TABLE /one.tnum Detailed information of IVs used in MR analyses.

We prefer the MR-Egger results when the results are confounded by pleiotropy ( 41). WM is deﬁned as the median of the weighted empirical density function of the ratio estimates and can output accurate results when more than 50% of the instrumental variables are invalid.That is, we prefer to use the results of the WM method when there is heterogeneity but notpleiotropy( 42).Horizontal multiplicity and heterogeneity tests In this study, outliers were detected by using the MR-PRESSO method.If outliers were present, they were removed and the analysis was repeated.The “leave-one-out” sensitivity analysis was performed by removing individual SNPs one at a time to assess whether the variation drove the association between the exposure and outcome variables ( 43).
In addition, to clarify whether there was horizontal pleiotropy in this MR analysis, the MR-Eggerintercept test was also performed, and if the intercept term in the MR-Egger intercept analysis was statistically signiﬁcant, the study was shown to have signiﬁcant horizontal pleiotropy ( 41). Finally, this study also used Cochran’s Qstatistic of MR-Egger and IVW for testing the heterogeneity of 24 independent omega- 3 fatty acids genetic IVs in the GWAS dataset for generalized epilepsy.Signiﬁcantheterogeneityintheanalysiswasdemonstrated if Cochran’s Qstatistic test was statistically signiﬁcant ( 44).Similar to the meta-analysis, we chose a random eﬀects model to analyze thestudyprocess.P<0.05wasconsideredsigniﬁcantinallstudies.AllstatisticalanalyseswereperformedusingRstudioversion4.1.3, and R packages such as “Two sample MR” and “MR-PRESSO” wereused.Data availability AlldatausedinthisstudywereobtainedfromGWASsummary statistics which were publicly released by genetic consortia.

Causal eﬀects of omega-/three.tnum fatty acids on epilepsy The IVW results ( Figure2) showed a causal eﬀect association between omega-3 fatty acids and generalized epilepsy [odds ratio (OR)=1.160, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) =1.051–1.279, P =0.003]. Besides, WM (OR =1.203, 95% CI =1.079–1.342, P =0.001) and MR-Egger (OR =1.181, 95% CI =1.028–1.357, P=0.029) also supported the causal relationship, showing the robustness of the results.Given that all beta values in the results were in the same direction, our analysis suggests that increased levels of omega-3 fatty acids may increase the risk of generalized epilepsy( Figure3,Table2).Horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity analysis There was no evidence of heterogeneity in IVW analysis ( Q =34.579,P=0.042) and MR-Egger regression ( Q=34.797,P =0.054).MR-Egger regression showed no evidence of directional pleiotropy across genetic variants (Egger intercept = −0.001;P =0.713).

Discussion To the best of our knowledge, the present study for the ﬁrst time applied MR analysis to infer the causal relationships between human blood omega-3 fatty acids and the risk of epilepsy in a large population data set of generalized epilepsy.Our results suggested a causal relationship between increased levels of blood omega-3 fatty acids and the risk of epilepsy, which is inconsistent with many previous studies suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids areantiepileptic.Omega-3 fatty acids are PUFAs with multiple double bonds, mainly including alpha-linolenic (ALA), EPA, and DHA.Most importantly, omega-3 fatty acids are involved in the transmission of nerve impulses and play neuroprotective roles in CNS disorders (45,46).
Speciﬁcally, several studies have suggested that omega- 3 fatty acids, elements of neuronal membrane phospholipids, may exert antiepileptic eﬀects by stabilizing neuronal membranes, reducing inﬂammation, and resisting oxidative damage ( 17–19). These antiepileptic eﬀects have been veriﬁed on diﬀerent animal models of epilepsy ( 20–24).Unlike the consistency of results from animalexperiments,thefunctionsofomega-3fattyacidsinclinical trials remain controversial.Some clinical studies have concluded thatfattyacidsarebeneﬁcialinhumanswithepilepsy.Forexample, the ketogenic diet, which we are familiar with, has been proposed to rise the resistance to seizures by increasing omega-3 fatty acids levels, particularly DHA ( 25,26).One RCT of diﬀerent dose of ﬁsh oil (EPA and DHA mixture) vs.
placebo in 24 participants with drug-resistant epilepsy revealed that low-dose ﬁsh oil was associated with a 33.6% reduction in seizure frequency compared withplaceboaftertreatmentbuthigh-doseﬁshoilwasnodiﬀerent than placebo in reducing seizures ( 27). Yuen et al.performed one RCT in which 57 intractable epilepsy patients were randomized to either the omega-3 fatty acids supplement group (30 cases) or the placebo group (27 cases).Results showed that seizure frequency was reduced over the ﬁrst 6 weeks of treatment in the omega- 3 fatty acids supplement group, but this eﬀect was not sustained (28).Not to be overlooked, some RCTs have also found that omega-3 fatty acids do not reduce seizure frequency and even increased seizure frequency compared to placebo, which supports the results of our MR study.In one RCT, researchers concluded that no positive eﬀect of omega-3 fatty acids on seizure frequency was identiﬁed ( 29).
What is more, in another RCT, 21 adults with uncontrolled epilepsy were randomized to either a placebo group or the PUFAs supplement group (EPA and DHA mixture). After a 12-week treatment period, seizure frequency increased by 6% in the PUFAs group while decreased 12% in the placebo group (30).The diversity of these RCTs results reveals that the relationship between omega-3 fatty acids and epilepsy is currently unclear.Probably due to the huge diﬃculty in conducting RCTs, the sample sizes of these studies were small, which also greatly aﬀected the accuracy of the results.
In our MR study, relying on the GWAS database, we included a large sample of generalized epilepsy genetic data ( ncase=3,769), which also gave us a high degreeofaccuracyinourresults.However,weshouldalsonotethat thecurrentRCTsincludedpatientswithmostlyrefractoryordrug- resistantepilepsy,andtheGWASepilepsygeneticdataweusedwas derived from patients with generalized epilepsy, which is not clear what proportion of these are refractory or drug-resistant epilepsy. These subtle diﬀerences in the sample may also have an impact Frontiersin Neurology /zero.tnum/six.tnum frontiersin.org Liang et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fneur./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/three.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum FIGURE /four.tnum Stability of the causal relationship between omega-/three.tnum fatty acid s and generalized epilepsy assessed by leave-one-out sensitiv ity analysis.

The y-axis shows the analysis of the eﬀect of removing individual SNP on generalized epilepsy.on the results.Therefore, future studies targeting the relationship between omega-3 fatty acids and diﬀerent subtypes of epilepsy aremeaningful.On the other hand, based on the conﬂicting results of the above RCTs and our MR study, we assume that it might also be necessary to re-examine the traditional view that fatty acids can be antiepileptic or protective of multiple systems in the body.Interestingly, two previous studies also support our assumptions (47,48).In recent years, the American Diabetes Association has recommended that UK patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus intake oily ﬁsh and replace SFAs with PUFAs to prevent diabetes, which appears to be a consensus on the anti-diabetic eﬀects of PUFAs ( 49).
However, in a meta-analysis study, researchers compared the eﬀects of higher intake levels of omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and total PUFAs on the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively, and showed no signiﬁcant reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the investigators also conducted an intervention study in which patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus consuming higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and total PUFAs.The results also showed no signiﬁcant reduction in key type 2 diabetes- related indicators (glycated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance index) ( 47).Another meta-analysis measuredtheassociationbetweenomega-3fattyacidsandall-cause mortality by three aspects, including mixed prevention, secondary prevention, and patients with the cardio-aid deﬁbrillators.
All the resultsshowedthatomega-3fattyacidssupplementationcouldnot reduce the risk of all-cause mortality, sudden death, myocardial infarction, cardiac death, or stroke based on relative and absolute measures of association ( 48). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume FIGURE /five.tnum Funnel plot of the causal relationship between omega-/three.tnum fatty acid s and generalized epilepsy as assessed by MR analysis.that omega-3 fatty acids may not be so magical or beneﬁcial to the organism and that future studies should be designed to be more in-depthandquestionable.The most valuable strengths of this study are its relatively large sample size and the idea of applying a two-sample MR analysis, which minimizes the risk of confounding bias and allows us to take advantage of large-scale epilepsy genetic data.Besides, our study was largely free of reverse causality and residual confounders by using the MR analysis.
Speciﬁcally, we employ a series of methods to verify any violation of MR Frontiersin Neurology /zero.tnum/seven.tnum frontiersin.org Liang et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fneur./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/three.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum assumptions in order to ensure the reliability of MR estimates.The robustness of MR estimates is conﬁrmed by the concordant directions and similar magnitude of various MR models.No evidence of horizontal pleiotropy was found using complementary statisticalmethods.It is worth noting that there are still several limitations in this study as well.First, the current GWAS database does not contain the summary-level statistics of epilepsy subcategories, such as drug-resistant epilepsy or refractory epilepsy, making it not possible to further infer the potential relationship between blood omega-3 fatty acids level and risk for subtypes of epilepsy.
Second, the data of exposure and outcome in this study were both derived from European databases. Therefore, the results may not be suitable for other ethnic populations.Third, giving that the datasets of exposure and outcome were both derived from European population, there may be a degree of sample overlap.However, as far as we know, there is no good way to evaluate overlapping sample sizes.Finally, although this study suggests that blood omega-3 fatty acids level is causally associated with epilepsy, we should recognize that MR analysis is only a predictive resultwithoutveriﬁcation.Therefore,thiscausalitystillneedstobe further explored and veriﬁed in well-powered RCTs to clarify the existenceofcausality.Conclusion In conclusion, this MR study indicated that omega-3 fatty acids could increase the risk of generalized epilepsy in a causalway.
