Abstract: The objective of the present work was to develop PTH (1-34)-loaded stealth nanoliposomes (PTH-LPs) by employing the use of the Quality by Design (QbD) approach. Risk identiﬁcation was carried out using the Ishikawa ﬁshbone diagram.PTH-LPs were optimized using Box Behnken Design, a type of response surface methodology to examine the effect of independent variables on dependent variables such as particle size and percentage entrapment efﬁciency (%EE).
Design space was generated for PTH-LPs to reduce interbatch variability during the formulation development process. Furthermore, a cytotoxicity assay, cell proliferation assay, calcium calorimetric assay, miner- alized nodule formation, and cellular uptake assay were carried out on MG-63 osteoblast-like cells.The results obtained from these procedures demonstrated that lipid concentration had a signiﬁcant positive impact on particle size and %EE, whereas cholesterol concentration showed a reduction in %EE.The particle size and %EE of optimized formulation were found to be 147.76 ±2.14 nm and 69.18±3.62%, respectively.Optimized PTH-LPs showed the sustained release proﬁle of the drug.In vitro cell evaluation studies showed PTH-LPs have good biocompatibility with MG-63 cells.The cell proliferation study revealed that PTH-LPs induced osteoblast differentiation which improved the formation of mineralized nodules in MG-63 cells.
The outcome of the present study conclu- sively demonstrated the potential of the QbD concept to build quality in PTH-LPs with improved osteoanabolic therapy in osteoporosis. Keywords: PTH (1-34); osteoporosis; nanoliposomes; QbD; Box Behnken design; MG-63 cells 1.Introduction Osteoporosis is characterized by a progressive decline in bone mineral density [ 1,2].It progresses silently, and patients come to know about the disease generally when a painful and severe fracture occurs.The efﬁcacy of several pharmacotherapeutics has been investigated for the management of this skeletal disorder.PTH (1-34) (Teriparatide) is an FDA-approved peptide-based drug that stimulates bone formation via stimulating osteoblasts [ 3,4].This anabolic drug is mainly administered to patients suffering from postmenopausal and drug-induced osteoporosis.The recommended therapeutic dose for the drug is 20 µg injected subcutaneously once a day for two years [ 3,5,6].
However, its short half-life severely restricts the treatment efﬁciency. In humans, the reported half-life of the drug is 5 min intravenously [7].Therefore, various drug delivery strategies have been explored to modulate PTH (1-34) release [ 8–10].For instance, Altaani et al.have developed a nanoemulsion of PTH (1-34) using a polyelectrolyte complexation approach [ 11].PTH (1-34)-loaded PLGA micro- spheres were developed by Eswaramoorthy et al.and explored to suppress osteoarthritis progression in rats [ 12].Baskaran et al.used PLGA microspheres containing PTH (1-34) for sustained release of the drug in a rat model.Another study by Rajalakshmanan et al.demonstrated the release of PTH (1-34) from PLGA microspheres in rats for 3 weeks [ 13].Pharmaceutics 2022 ,14, 2417.https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics14112417 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics Pharmaceutics 2022 ,14, 2417 2 of 18 Apart from microspheres, nanoformulations have also been explored for PTH (1-34) de- livery.
Dave et al. have developed hydroxyapatite-based nanorods of PTH (1-34) to enhance the anabolic effects [ 14], and Jaji et al.have explored aragonite calcium carbonate nanocrystals for potential PTH (1-34) delivery [ 15].Narayanan et al.have explored chitosan nanoparticles [ 16], thiolated chitosan nanoparticles [ 17], and pegylated nanoparticles for the delivery of PTH (1-34) in osteoporosis [ 18].Kristensen et al.have investigated the effect of the coadministration of insulin and PTH (1-34) at different pH by employing a cell-penetrating peptide [ 19].To the best of our knowledge, pegylated nanoliposomes have not been explored as a drug carrier system for PTH (1-34).Liposomes remain as one of the most preferred drug-delivery systems [ 20–23].Differ- ent properties of liposomes like biocompatibility, low toxicity, biodegradability, and apti- tude to entrap both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs make liposomes widely accepted nanocarriers in drug delivery [ 24,25].
In addition, the ease of manufacturing at a large scale compared to other nano-based drug delivery systems makes liposomes interesting not only for investigational purposes but also as a commercially viable drug-delivery system. Several polymers are being investigated to improve the systemic circulation time of liposomes [ 26]; however, poly-(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been widely explored among polymeric materials as a steric stabilizer.It is a linear polyether diol with many useful characteristics, such as solubility in aqueous and organic media, biocompatibility [ 27], good excretion kinetics [ 28], and very low immunogenicity [ 29].These versatile and important characteristics allow its use in a variety of applications in drug delivery, as well as in the biomedical ﬁeld.The development of a pharmaceutical dosage form is based on several critical aspects, including the selection of formulation variables and process parameters that can affect the quality of the ﬁnal dosage form.
A more systematic approach for developing a pharmaceu- tical formulation is Quality by Design (QbD), which is a risk- and knowledge-based quality management approach. It is “a systematic approach to development that begins with a pre- deﬁned objective and emphasizes product and process understanding and process control, based on sound science and quality risk management” [ 30].Regulatory agencies encourage pharmaceutical industries to adopt a QbD approach to build quality into the product through design efforts, from product conceptualization to commercialization [31,32].In our previous study, we screened material attributes and process parameters affect- ing PTH (1-34)-encapsulated lipid vesicles using Taguchi standard orthogonal array L8 design [ 33].
The present work discusses the development of PTH (1-34)-loaded stealth nanoliposomes (PTH-LPs) using the QbD concept to understand the formulation and pro- cess variables for improving the quality of nanoformulation in terms of particle size and % entrapment efﬁciency (%EE), which are critical parameters that affect the performance of PTH-LPs. Further, various cellular assays were performed to check the effectiveness of optimized PTH-LPs in osteoporotic treatment.2.Materials and Methods PTH (1-34), paraformaldehyde, alizarin red solution, DAPI (4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylin dole dihydrochloride), and cholesterol was procured from Sigma-Aldrich (Bangalore, India).Hydrogenated phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) and N-(carbonyl methoxy polyethyleneglycol- 2000)-1,2-distearoylsn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Na-salt; MPEG-2000-DSPE) were obtained as gift samples from Lipoid GmbH (Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany).
Absolute ethanol was procured from Shree Chalthan Vibhag Khand, Uddyog Sahakari Mandli Ltd., Surat, India, and Sodium chloride (NaCl) from HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd.(Mumbai, India).Potassium chloride (KCl), sodium hydrogen phosphate (Na 2HPO4), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH 2PO4), acetonitrile, formic acid, and isopropyl alcohol were procured from Fischer Scientiﬁc (Mumbai, India).NBD-PE (N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3- diazol-4-yl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, triethylammonium Salt), trypsin, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from InvitrogenTM, Thermo- Fischer Scientiﬁc (Mumbai, India).Ultra-pure water from Millipore Milli-Q (Synergy UV) Pharmaceutics 2022 ,14, 2417 3 of 18 water puriﬁcation system (Merck Millipore) was used throughout the study.All other reagents used were of analytical grade and were used without further processing.MG- 63 osteoblast-like cells were procured from the National Center for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India.2.1.
QbD Approach in Formulation Development The entire QbD-based study involves the following elements: (a) Deﬁne the Quality Targeted Product Proﬁle (QTPP), which forms the basic design for the development of the product. QTPPs are based on knowledge space developed from the relevant scientiﬁc literature with appropriate in vivo relevance; (b) Identiﬁcation of potential Critical Material Attributes (CMAs), Critical Process Parameters (CPPs), and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs).As per the ICH Q8 R2 guideline, “CQA is a physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality”; (c) Perform Risk Assessment (RA) to identify CMAs and CPPs that may have signiﬁcant impact on CQAs.
Among the various tools mentioned in ICH guideline Q9 for performing the RA, Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) are the most widely used [ 34]. These tools help to identify the CMAs and CPPs that affect CQAs.The Design of Experiment (DOE) is based on the RA results.DOE can be planned by considering the most inﬂuential CMAs and CPPs deﬁning the design space.As per the regulatory agency United States Food & Drugs Administration (USFDA), changes within the design space is not considered a change [ 35], and hence it can be used during scale-up and post-approval changes (SUPAC); (d) For ensuring consistent product quality, the development of a control strategy is mandatory, and (e) Finally, product lifecycle management.In conclusion, applying QbD in the development of a pharmaceutical product helps in better product and process understanding.
Therefore, the development of PTH-LPs using the QbD approach was initiated as per guidance ICH Q8(R2) for pharmaceutical development. Further, guidance for the industry for liposomal drug products approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was also considered during the development of the liposomal formulation [36].Identiﬁcation of QTPP and CQA (Table 1) was carried out based on prior experience and scientiﬁc literature for liposomal formulation development.Figure 1 depicts the overview of the QbD approach used in the development of liposomal formulation, whereas Figure S1 summarizes the road map for formulation development of liposomal formulation using the ethanol injection method.
After the experimentation and data analysis, the obtained experimental results were compared with predicted responses (CQAs/dependent variables) and the percentage residual value was calculated using the following formula; % Residual = (Predicted results −Observed results)/(Predicted results) ×100 (1) Table 1.

The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% v/v formic acid in Milli-Q water as an aqueous phase (A) and 0.1% v/v formic acid in acetonitrile as an organic phase (B). The injection volume was kept at 50 µL, and anal- ysis was performed at a 210 nm wavelength [4 0].%EE was calculated with the help of the following equations.%EE = (Amount of total drug − Amount of unentrapped drug)/(Amount of total drug added) × 100 (2) 2.3.3.Cryogenic Field Emission Scanni ng Electron Microscopy (Cryo FE-SEM) Cryo FE-SEM (SIGMA S300, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) was used to inspect the morphol- ogy of optimized PTH-LPs.For this, samples were transferred on rivets mounted on a cryo-SEM sample holder.It was then submerged in liquid nitrogen for freezing.The fro- zen samples were fractured using a cold knife.Sublimation of samples was done for 10 min at −90 °C, and images of samples were obtained after subjecting the samples to the chamber of Cryo FE-SEM.2.3.4.
In Vitro Drug Release The in vitro PTH (1-34) release from PTH-LPs was performed using a sample-sepa- rate method. Pellets of PTH-LPs were dispersed in 10 mL of PBS (pH 7.4).Then, 1 mL of Figure 2.Development of PTH-LPs.( A) Amino acid sequence of PTH (1-34), ( B) Representative instrumental setup for the development of PTH-LPs, ( C) Vial containing dispersion of PTH-LPs, (D) Schematic representation of PTH-LPs.2.3.2.Determination of %EE The drug content in PTH-LPs was determined using HPLC (HPLC 1260 Inﬁnity, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) by injecting the supernatant after ultracen- trifugation of PTH-LPs at 50,000 rpm.Chromatographic separation was carried out using the XBridge BEH C18 column (300 Å, 4.6 mm ×150 mm, 10 µm).The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% v/vformic acid in Milli-Q water as an aqueous phase (A) and 0.1% v/v formic acid in acetonitrile as an organic phase (B).
The injection volume was kept at 50 µL, and analysis was performed at a 210 nm wavelength [ 40]. %EE was calculated with the help of the following equations.%EE = (Amount of total drug −Amount of unentrapped drug)/(Amount of total drug added) ×100 (2) 2.3.3.Cryogenic Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (Cryo FE-SEM) Cryo FE-SEM (SIGMA S300, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) was used to inspect the morphology of optimized PTH-LPs.For this, samples were transferred on rivets mounted on a cryo- SEM sample holder.It was then submerged in liquid nitrogen for freezing.The frozen samples were fractured using a cold knife.Sublimation of samples was done for 10 min at −90◦C, and images of samples were obtained after subjecting the samples to the chamber of Cryo FE-SEM.2.3.4.In Vitro Drug Release The in vitro PTH (1-34) release from PTH-LPs was performed using a sample-separate method.Pellets of PTH-LPs were dispersed in 10 mL of PBS (pH 7.4).
Then, 1 mL of liposomal dispersion was added into single microcentrifuge tubes (MCTs) for a single time point. All MCTs were incubated at 37◦C in an orbital shaker at speed of 100 rpm for 24 h.At time intervals of 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h, MCTs were taken out of the orbital shaker and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm.The supernatant was removed, and pellets were dissolved in absolute ethanol.Samples were injected in HPLC to quantify released PTH (1-34) from PTH-LPs using a validated HPLC method.2.3.5.Cell Culture In present study, MG-63 osteoblast-like cells (NCCS Pune, Pune, India) were used for cellular assay.Cells were cultured in alpha-modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( αMEM, Gibco, Billings, MT, USA).The medium was supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 mg mL−1 Pharmaceutics 2022 ,14, 2417 6 of 18 of streptomycin, 100 U mL−1of penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (InvitrogenTM, Germany).The cultures were maintained in T-75 ﬂasks and incubated at 37◦C with 5% CO 2.
Cytotoxicity Assay The cytotoxicity of PTH-LPs was determined by Alamar blue assay. This is a quanti- tative calorimetric assay based on the biochemical reduction of dye (Alamar blue) from non-ﬂuorescent blue to ﬂuorescent red.Brieﬂy, MG-63 cells were seeded onto 96 well plates at density 1×104cells per well in 100 µL of culture medium.The cells were incubated in an incubator at 37◦C for 24 h for attachment.After 24 h, the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS.Next, 100 µL of medium containing various concen- trations of PTH (1-34) and PTH-LPs were added to a well plate and incubated for 24 h.After 24 h incubation, the medium was removed, and wells were rinsed with PBS.Then, the 100 µL medium containing 10 µL Alamar Blue reagent was added in each well and incubated for another 2 h.Absorbance was measured using a multimode UV microplate reader (Varioskan LUX, Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) at 520–590 nm.
The % cell viability was obtained from the following equation: % Viability = (Average of samples treated with formulation)/(Average of control) ×100 (3) Cell Proliferation Assay Cell proliferation assay was performed to evaluate the osteoblast differentiation po- tential of PTH-LPs on MG-36 cells. For this study, 1 ×104cells were seeded into 48 well plates.The cells were incubated for 24 h at 37◦C.Then, the cells were treated with PTH-LPs and further incubated for 7 days.At 3, 5, and 7 days, cells were washed with PBS and treated with a 400 µL medium containing Alamar Blue reagent.After 2 h of incubation, absorbance was measured using a multimode UV microplate reader at 520–590 nm.Fur- thermore, light microscope images of cells treated as a control and samples on the third day of the experiment were also captured to evaluate the osteoblast proliferation potential of PTH-LPs.
Calcium Calorimetric Assay Free calcium concentration from medium after the 7-day incubation period of MG-63 cells was performed using a Calcium Calorimetric Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK). Calcium ion concentration was measured by measuring the chromogenic complex formed between o-cresolphthalein and calcium ion.The chromogenic complex was de- termined spectrophotometrically by measuring the optical density at 575 nm.The optical density was proportional to the concentration of calcium ions present in the samples.The assay was performed as per manufacturer’s instructions.Brieﬂy, 50 µL of samples or calcium standards were added to a 96-well plate.90 µL of chromogenic reagent and 60 µL of calcium assay buffer was added to wells containing controls, samples, or standards.The assay plate was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and absorbance was measured at 575 nm using microplate reader.
Mineralized Nodule Formation Alizarin Red assay was used to detect the osteoblast’s mineralized nodule formation upon treatment of the drug and PTH-LPs. For this, cells were seeded at 1 ×104in 6-well plates and cultured in osteoblast-speciﬁc media.After the 24 h, cells were washed with PBS, and different treatments were given.Wells containing only media were considered control.After 7 days, cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min.Paraformaldehyde was removed and cells were washed with PBS.Cells were stained with Alizarin Red solution (1.5%) for 15 min.Unreacted dye was removed, and cells were rewashed 2–4 times with PBS.Then, mineral nodules were observed under a light microscope.For quantitative analysis, pyridinium chloride (10%) was added to each well to dissolve the dye, and the Pharmaceutics 2022 ,14, 2417 7 of 18 concentration of dye was determined by measuring the absorbance of the sample using a microplate reader at 562 nm.
Cellular Uptake Study A cellular uptake study of PTH-LPs was performed by using confocal microscopy. MG-63 cells (1×105) were cultured on a glass coverslip in a 35 mm culture plate for 24 h for this study.After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with ﬂuorescent PTH-LPs for 1, 3, and 6 h.After each time point, cells were washed with PBS and ﬁxed with 4% ( w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature.Again, cells were washed 3 times with PBS.The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI for 15 min, and excess DAPI was washed out using PBS three times.The glass coverslip was removed from the culture plate and air dried.DPX mounting agent was used for the attachment of the coverslip on the glass slide and kept at room temperature for drying.Confocal microscope analysis was performed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).Fluorescent PTH-LPs excitation and emission wavelength were 463 nm and 536 nm respectively.
Image J software was used to process the images and to perform semiquantitative analysis. Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF) was determined to compare cellular uptake of PTH-LPs at different time points without further processing.2.4.Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis of the results was carried out using GraphPad Prism (version 6.0, San Diego, CA, USA).All values are expressed as the mean ±standard deviation (SD) ( n≥3).Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using Student’s t-test.The calculated p-values were deﬁned as follows: * p< 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p< 0.001.Nonsigniﬁcant differences are marked as n.s.3.Results and Discussion 3.1.QbD Approach: SETTING of QTPP , Identiﬁcation of CQAs, and Risk Assessment QTPP is the most important element in the QbD approach to help formulation and process design and to understand the ﬁnal product quality proﬁle.
As per ICH Q8 (R2) (2009), QTPP is ‘a prospective summary of the quality characteristics of a drug product that ideally will be achieved to ensure the desired quality, taking into account of safety and efﬁcacy of the drug product’. Table 1 deﬁnes the possible QTPP of liposomal products.The present study deals with the development of pegylated nanoliposomes encap- sulated with the peptide drug PTH (1-34) for systemic administration that would remain in the circulatory system for a prolonged period and deliver the drug for a longer time.Hence, the appropriate size of nanoliposomes (100–200 nm), pegylation of liposomes for longer systemic circulation, the high therapeutic concentration of the drug for therapeutic efﬁcacy, and optimal cholesterol concentration for vesicles stability are the main QTPPs for developing the formulation.After the QTPP , the second most important step of the QbD approach is to determine crucial and potential CQAs of the drug product.
CQAs are physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological parameters that should be within the deﬁned range to determine product quality. The selection of CQAs and QTPP is based on an understanding of drug products, preliminary studies, literature review, and experience in formulation development.Risk assessment is a process to determine which CMAs and CPPs affect CQAs.Risk analysis can be done using several techniques to identify risk factors that inﬂu- ence CQAs.A risk assessment strategy assists in improving the quality of the process and formulation and in identifying the critical attributes that might affect the ﬁnal formulation’s quality.In this study, we have utilized the Ishikawa ﬁshbone diagram for the identiﬁcation of risk factors (Figure S2).As per ICH guideline Q9, the risk is a combination of the proba- bility of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm.
Further, a risk estimation matrix was developed to evaluate the qualitative impact of CMAs and CPPs on the CQAs which was identiﬁed through the Ishikawa ﬁshbone diagram. In the present work, particle size, Pharmaceutics 2022 ,14, 2417 8 of 18 %EE, and zeta potential were identiﬁed as CQAs of the ﬁnal product.Thus, understanding the potential risk affecting these CQAs is a crucial step in risk assessment.Table 2 repre- sents the risk estimation matrix showing the risk ranking of CMAs and CPPs based on the Ishikawa ﬁshbone diagram.Table 2.Risk estimation matrix.ParametersDrug Product CQA’s %EE Particle Size Zeta Potential CMAsDrug concentration High Medium Medium Lipid concentration High High Medium Cholesterol concentration High High Medium CPPsStirring rate High High Medium Stirring time Medium Medium Low 3.2.
Box Behnken Design Based on the preliminary experimentation, prior experience, and risk analysis, lipid concentration, cholesterol concentration, and stirring rate were selected to optimize the PTH-LPs, whereas DSPE-MPEG-200K, stirring time, aqueous to organic ratio, and injection rate were kept constant. For determining the effects of identiﬁed CMAs and CPPs, a 3-level Box Behnken Design (BBD) with three independent factors was developed using Design-Expert software (Version 12, Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).Two different CQAs (responses/dependent factors) were evaluated; particle size and %EE.Levels of independent variables examined in this experimental design were obtained within the range obtained from preliminary experimentation and a literature search.The matrix of experimental design included 17 runs with three replicates.The layout of the experimental design with experimental runs obtained is enlisted in Table S1.
Various statistical modules from Design Expert software were utilized to ﬁt the experi- mental data with the selected experimental design and calculate the statistical parameters. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) method was used for the calculations and data analysis of statistical parameters.Design space establishment is based on the regression models; therefore, the same software was used to generate the design space.All the QTPP criteria are met at a predetermined degree of risk.3.3.The Inﬂuence of CMA and CPP on Particle Size The lipidic vesicular size was obtained between 39.48 to 155.83 nm.Statistical analysis showed a model F-value of 5.86, and p-values less than 0.0500 indicate the model and its terms are signiﬁcant.There is only a 1.42% chance that a large F-value could occur due to noise.Values greater than 0.1000 indicate that the model terms are not signiﬁcant.If there are many insigniﬁcant model terms, then model reduction may improve the model.
Therefore, a reduced quadratic model was used in particle size analysis to get signiﬁcant model and model terms. Data obtained from ANOVA showed CMA has a signiﬁcant impact on particle size, since the p-value of the model and lack of ﬁt were 0.0142 and 0.9486, respectively.The lack of ﬁt F-value of 0.29 implies the lack of ﬁt is not signiﬁcant relative to the pure error.Nonsigniﬁcant lack of ﬁt is good.Furthermore, the ﬁt’s statistical data show that the predicted R2of 0.2234 is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted R2of 0.3778, and the difference found between them is less than 0.2.Adequate precision is another statistical parameter that needs to be evaluated that measures the signal-to-noise ratio.A ratio greater than 4 is desirable.In the case of particle size, this ratio is 6.991, indicating an adequate signal,; hence, this model can be used to navigate the design space.Statistical data of model terms are enlisted in Table S2.
Furthermore, residual analysis was performed to ﬁnd the trend of the data sets. This analysis showed that all residual plots behaved very well (Figure S3).Residuals estimate the experimental errors obtained by subtracting the observed responses from the predicted Pharmaceutics 2022 ,14, 2417 9 of 18 responses.In this formulation, lipid concentration had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence/impact on particle size; this afﬁrmation was sustained by counter plots and the 3D surface plot (Figure 3 and Figure S5).This demonstrates that a rise in lipid concentration increases the vesicular size.Cholesterol concentration showed the curvature effect.When cholesterol concentration is at 10–12 mM, it shows an increase in the particle size.Furthermore, a concentration between 13–17 mM of cholesterol showed an unchanged particle size.
Generally, an increase in the stirring speed reduces the particle size, but in the present work, we did not ﬁnd an impact of stirring speed; this might be due to the spontaneous formation of liposomes in the ethanol injection method or the narrow range of the stirring speed. The box plot depicted in Figure S6 is indicative of the possible interaction of all the variables on the deﬁned response.Pharmaceutics 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 18 impact on particle size, since the p-value of the model and lack of fit were 0.0142 and 0.9486, respectively.The lack of fit F-value of 0.29 implies the lack of fit is not significant relative to the pure error.Nonsignificant lack of fit is good.Furthermore, the fit’s statistical data show that the predicted R 2 of 0.2234 is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted R2 of 0.3778, and the difference found between them is less than 0.2.
Adequate precision is another statistical parameter that needs to be evaluated that measures the signal-to-noise ratio. A ratio greater than 4 is desirable.In the case of particle size, this ratio is 6.991, indi- cating an adequate signal,; hence, this model can be used to navigate the design space.Statistical data of model terms are enlisted in Table S2.Furthermore, residual analysis was performed to find the trend of the data sets.This analysis showed that all residual plots behav ed very well (Figure S3).Residuals estimate the experimental errors obtained by subtracting the observed responses from the pre- dicted responses.In this formulation, lipid concentration had a significant influence/im- pact on particle size; this affirmation was sustained by counter plots and the 3D surface plot (Figures 3 and S5).This demonstrates that a rise in lipid concentration increases the vesicular size.Cholesterol concentration show ed the curvature effect.
When cholesterol concentration is at 10–12 mM, it shows an in crease in the particle size. Furthermore, a concentration between 13–17 mM of choleste rol showed an unchanged particle size.Gen- erally, an increase in the stirring speed reduce s the particle size, but in the present work, we did not find an impact of stirring speed; this might be due to the spontaneous for- mation of liposomes in the ethanol injection method or the narrow range of the stirring speed.The box plot depicted in Figure S6 is in dicative of the possible interaction of all the variables on the defined response.Figure 3.Three-dimensional surfac e plot for PTH-LPs.( A) Effect of lipid conc entration and choles- terol concentration on particle size.( B) Effect of stirring speed and lipid concentration on particle size.( C) Effect of lipid concentration and stirring speed on %EE.( D) Effect of lipid concentration and cholesterol concentration on %EE.Figure 3.Three-dimensional surface plot for PTH-LPs.

The lack of ﬁt F-value of 0.59 implies the lack of ﬁt is not signiﬁcant relative to the pure error. There is a 77.61% chance that a lack of ﬁt F-value this large could occur due to noise.The difference between predicted R2and adjusted R2is less than 0.2.A ratio of 4.552 shows an adequate signal, suggesting this model is adequate for navigation of the design space.Table S2 enlists all the statistical terms for model selection.Similar to particle size, the residual analysis was Pharmaceutics 2022 ,14, 2417 10 of 18 also carried out for %EE.All the residual plots behaved well.Figure S4 depicts all residual plots for %EE.An increase in lipid concentration may increase the %EE.In the current formulation, lipid concentration had a signiﬁcant role in %EE.Increased lipid concentration showed an improvement in %EE, which was depicted from all counter plots and 3D surface plots (Figures 3 and S5).
It has been observed that high cholesterol content may negatively inﬂuence %EE, and thus the optimum concentration of cholesterol could be obtained. In our case, with an increase in the cholesterol concentration, a reduction in %EE was observed, which might be due to the competition of hydrophobic cholesterol with hydrophilic peptide drug.Figure S7 depicts the box plot for %EE.3.5.Design Space Generation Considering the target range of CQAs, a design space was generated (Figure S8) by considering the impact of formulation variables, i.e., lipid concentration and cholesterol concentration.The stirring speed was set constant at 500 rpm to ﬁnalize the formula- tion strategy.For the optimal formulation, the targeted CQAs were maximum entrapment of pep- tide into the lipid vesicles and a particle size less than 200 nm.The optimal formulation was obtained by using 60.25 ±11.64 mM of lipid, 9.33 ±2.57 mM of cholesterol, 3 mM of pegylated lipid, and 500 rpm stirring speed.
Table 3 represents the optimized parameters for the developed liposomal product. The optimal formulation was developed in triplicate.The obtained experimental CQAs, expressed as mean values, were compared with pre- dicted values (Table 3).The experimental results were found close to the predicted values.Furthermore, the predictability of the model was demonstrated by % residual values.Table 3.Optimized formulation parameters.CMAs/CPPs Values Responses TargetPredicted ValueExperimental ValueResidual Values (%) Lipid concentration (mM) 60.25 ±11.64 Y 1 <200 nm 142.93 ±2.49 147.76±2.14−3.26 Cholesterol concentration (mM) 9.33 ±2.57 Y 2 >30% 70.63 ±6.51 69.18±3.62 2.05 3.6.Physicochemical Evaluation of PTH-LPs 3.6.1.Particle Size, Zeta Potential, and Morphological Assessment Physicochemical characteristics such as particle size, zeta potential, and entrapment efﬁciency of PTH-LPs were evaluated.The particle size distribution of the optimized PTH-LPs is presented in Figure 4A.
The single peak of PSD of PTH-LPs demonstrated the even distribution of liposomal vesicles in the optimized PTH-LPs. Average particle size of optimized PTH-LPs was found to be 147.76 ±2.14 nm, and zeta potential of PTH-LPs was found to be−27.00±3.55 mV (Figure 4B).%EE of PTH-LPs exhibited 69.18 ±3.62%.The developed PTH-LPs were also characterized by Cryo FE-SEM.This visual technique was employed to obtain details related to surface morphology and the mean size of lipo- somes.The images revealed the spherical shape of liposomes having a smooth surface.Figure 4C,D represents the morphological assessment of optimized PTH-LPs.Pharmaceutics 2022 ,14, 2417 11 of 18 Pharmaceutics 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 18 distribution of liposomal vesicles in the opti mized PTH-LPs.Average particle size of op- timized PTH-LPs was found to be 147.76 ± 2.14 nm, and zeta potential of PTH-LPs was found to be −27.00 ± 3.55 mV (Figure 4B).%EE of PTH-LPs exhibited 69.18 ± 3.62%.

Furthermore, it reached 75% at 6 h. More than 85% of the drug was released after 24 h.This sustained drug release pattern of PTH (1-34) from PTH- LPs might be due to the lipidic barrier of lip osomes hindering the diffusion of PTH (1-34).Moreover, cholesterol used in the formulatio n improves lipid bilayer fluidity and pre- vents the further diffus ion of the drug [41].Figure 4.Characteristics of optimized PTH-LPs.( A) Particle size distribution, ( B) Zeta potential, (C,D) Morphological assessment by Cryo-SEM.The data represent the means ±SD ( n= 3).3.6.2.In Vitro Drug Release In vitro drug release of plain PTH (1-34) and PTH (1-34) from PTH-LPs is shown in Figure 5.PTH-LPs demonstrated the sustained release of PTH (1-34) in PBS (pH 7.4), whereas drug release from plain PTH (1-34) solution showed more than 95% of the drug was released within 5 min.From PTH-LPs, more than 50% of the drug was released from formulation at 60 min, which was increased up to 70% at 3 h.

Similar to the PTH (1-34) (Figure 6A), PTH-LPs showed le ss cytotoxicity to the cells. Hence, these are safe as a biocompatible carrier for drug delivery.These results confirm that the PTH- LPs are safe in anti-osteoporotic therapy.Figure 6.Cytotoxicity study on MG-63 cells.( A) % cell viability of PTH (1-34) and ( B) % cell viability of PTH-LPs at different concentrations.Furthermore, as a part of the cell proliferation assay, cells were incubated for 7 days after the treatment.At 3-, 5-, and 7-day inte rvals, % proliferation was calculated using Alamar Blue reagent (Figure 7A–C).The cells treated with PTH-LPs showed a visibly high number of cells compared to the control and dr ug alone.These results could be due to the anabolic effect of sustained peptide release from PTH-LPs.Moreover, the osteoblast se- cretes the organic matrix, and in later stages , this matrix is mineralized by various bio- chemical pathways [42].
Therefore, this matrix could be the reason for the entrapment of the PTH-LPs and the formation of a depot. This depot probably releases the drug for a Figure 5.In vitro release proﬁle of PTH (1-34) (red) and PTH (1-34) from PTH-LPs (green).Data represent the mean ±SD ( n= 3).3.6.3.In Vitro Cytotoxicity Study and Cell Proliferation Assay Thein vitro cytotoxicity of free drug and PTH-LPs towards MG-63 cells was evaluated using Alamar Blue assay.As shown in Figure 6, % viability of the cells treated with the Pharmaceutics 2022 ,14, 2417 12 of 18 drug and PTH-LPs for 24 h was evaluated at a concentration up to 40 µg/mL.Similar to the PTH (1-34) (Figure 6A), PTH-LPs showed less cytotoxicity to the cells.Hence, these are safe as a biocompatible carrier for drug delivery.These results conﬁrm that the PTH-LPs are safe in anti-osteoporotic therapy.Pharmaceutics 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 18 Figure 5.In vitro release profile of PTH (1-34) (red) and PTH (1-34) from PTH-LPs (green).

Calcium Calorimetric Assay Calcium calorimetric assay (Figure 8) shows the efﬂux or inﬂux of calcium ions due to the anabolic or catabolic activity of the PTH (1-34) peptide. Based on the dose, PTH stimulates the inﬂux or efﬂux of calcium.The cells treated with PTH-LPs had more calcium efﬂux, whereas the cells treated with bare peptide and the control group showed less compared to the PTH-LPs.These results along with the cell proliferation data demonstrate the anabolic effect of peptide on osteoblast cells.Pharmaceutics 2022 ,14, 2417 13 of 18 Pharmaceutics 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 18 prolonged period of time; hence, there was mo re proliferation in the PTH-LPs group than in the other groups.Figure 7A demonstrates th e increase in MG-63 cell numbers in terms of % proliferation, while Figure 7B depicts the photographic images of 3-day incubation of MG-63 cells.Figure 7C represents the line graph for % cell proliferation.

Optimized formulation was achieved by formulating the suggested composition from software, whose quality attributes are within the speciﬁed limits. PTH-LPs showed a sustained drug release proﬁle up to 24 h.In vitro cell experiments revealed that PTH- LPs had excellent biocompatibility with MG-63 cells.Cell proliferation and mineralized nodule formation assay suggested that PTH-LPs induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization as well as the formation of mineralized nodules.Furthermore, the cell uptake study revealed that the PTH-LPs have a great capacity for cellular uptake in MG-63 Pharmaceutics 2022 ,14, 2417 16 of 18 cells.Hence, it is concluded that PTH-LPs could be a potential solution for effectively delivering PTH (1-34) in osteoporosis.Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics14112417/s1: Figure S1.
