However, spray-dried milk prot eins have poor flowability and wettability owing to their fine particle sizes and high int er-particle cohesive forces.Fluidized bed agglomeration is widely used to improve the insta nt properties of food powders.
This study investigated the effect of fluidized bed ag glomeration on whey protein isolate (WPI)-fortified skim milk powder (SMP) at diffe rent SMP/WPI ratios. The fluidized bed process increased the particle size distribut ion, and agglomerated particles with grape-like structures were observed in the SEM i mages.As the size increased, the Carr index (CI) and Hausner ratio (HR) values of the agglomerated WPI- fortified SMP particles exhibited excellent flowability (CI: <1 5) and low cohesiveness (HR: <1.2).In addition, agglomerated WPI-fortified SMP particl es exhibited the faster wetting time than the instant criterion (<20 s).As a result, the rheological and physical properties of the WPI-fortified SMP particles were effectively improved by fluidized bed agglomeration.However, the fluidized bed agglomeration process led to a slight change in the color properties.The CIE L* decreased, and the CIE b* i ncreased because of the Maillard reaction.
The apparent viscosity (η a,10) and consistency index (K) values of the rehydrated solutions (60 g/180 mL water) increased with the inc reasing WPI ratio. These results may be useful for formulating protein-fortified milk po wder with better instant properties.Keywords whey protein, milk powder, sarco penia, fluidized bed, agglomera tion Introduction Globally, the population of people over the age of 65 is expect ed to rapidly increase from 524 million in 2010 to nearly 1.5 billion in 2050.Rapid a ging is accompanied by degenerative diseases, such as sarcopenia, which is characteriz ed by a reduction in muscle mass and strength (Liao et al., 2019; Park et al., 2021) .Dietary protein supplementation is important for preventing muscle loss, and mi lk proteins are widely used because of their functional, nutritional, and sensorial pr operties.In particular, ARTICLE Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.42, No.
6, 2022 916 whey protein is well known as an effective stimulant for promot ing muscle protein synthesis because it is rapidly digestible and contains all essential amino acids and branch-chain amino a cids (Gilmartin et al., 2020; Kobayashi et al., 2016). Englund et al.(2017) found that whey protein supplementation (20 g) fo r six months in 78.5±5.4 years old elderly people could promote an increase in muscle density, compared to the control group.Mori and Tokuda (2018) also reported a positive effect of whey protein supplementation (22.3 g) with exercise on muscl e mass in women aged 65–80 years.Therefore, high-protein supplements are a growing market with a drastic increase in the elderly population, and milk proteins can be used as ideal ingredients for sarcopenia prevention.Dairy-based powder products are required for instant properties related to rapid dispersion without the formation of lumps.
However, spray-dried milk proteins have poor flowability and we ttability because of their fine particle size and high inter- particle cohesive forces, resulting in slow reconstitution and lump formation problems (Atalar and Yazici, 2019; Ji et al., 2017). The fluidized bed agglomer ation process can be used to s olve these problems to help produce instant food powder.Fluidized bed agglomeration is defined as the size enlargement from small fine particles to large porous particles, and it can improve physical properties, such as size distribution, flowabi lity, mixing capacity, and dispersibility (Atalar and Yazici, 2021; Park and Yoo, 2020).Currently, protein-fortified milk po wders are consumed in Korea to prevent sarcopenia.
The demand for high-protein powder products is continuously increas ing in the Korean market, and most of these products are manufactured by the dry blending method that simply blends dair y powders, protein powders and other powdered ingredients such as vitamins and minerals (Jang and Oh, 2021; Kang et al., 2020). Some researchers have studied the effects of the fluidized bed agglomeration process on dairy powders such as sk im milk powder (SMP; Turchiuli et al., 2013), milk protein isolate (MPI; Ji et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2020), and whey prote i n i s ol a t e ( W P I ; J i e t a l ., 2 01 7 ) .H o w e ve r , t he e f f e c t o f t he fluidized bed agglomeration process in mixed systems of SMP and milk protein has not yet been studied.
Thus, in this study, the improved rheological and physical properties of WPI-fortifi e d S M P p r o d u c e d b y a f l u i d i z e d b e d p r o c e s s w e r e investigated, and the influence of the SMP/WPI ratio on fluidiz ed bed agglomeration was also examined. Materials and Methods Materials SMP (37% protein and 49% lactose) was supplied by the Seoul Dai ry Cooperative (Ansan, Korea), and WPI (HilmarTM 9410, 89% protein and 0.1% lactose) was obtained from Hilmar In gredients (CA, USA).The SMP was mixed with WPI at ratios of 9:1 (SMP9/WPI1), 8:2 (SMP8/WPI2), and 7:3 (SMP7/WPI3) to manufacture agglomerated WPI-fortified SMP samples.Fluidized bed agglomeration process The fluidized bed agglomeration process was performed according to the method of Barkouti et al.(2013) with slight modification.
One kilogram of raw powder was poured into a conical product ve ssel, and agglomeration of milk powder was conducted using a fluid bed granulator (Fluid Bed Lap System, E insystem, Anyang, Korea). The temperature of the injected air was set to 95±1℃, and the product temperature in the vessel was maintained at 55±1℃.Distilled water was used as the binder solution, which was pumped at a flow rate of 10 mL/min a nd sprayed using a fluid spray nozzle at a pressure of 1.5 bar.After spraying with distilled water for 30 min, the agglom erated milk powder was dried using hot air (55℃) for 10 min.The SMP without WPI also agglom erated under the same conditions and was used as the control sample.Fluidized Bed Agglomeration of WPI-Fortified SMP 917 Measurement of particle size distribution The size distributions of the raw and agglomerated WPI-fortifie d SMP particles were measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer (Mastersi zer 3000, Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK).
The D[3 ,2] (surface-weighted mean) and span (dispersion index) values were used to determine the s ize distribution of the agglomerated WPI-fortified SMP particles and were calculated from Eqs. (1) and (2), respective ly: D[3,2] =∑𝑛௜𝑑௜ଷ ∑𝑛௜𝑑௜ଶ ( 1 ) s p a n=𝐷𝑣90 − 𝐷𝑣10 𝐷𝑣50 ( 2 ) where d i is the average diameter of the i class interval, and n i is the number of particles with diameter d i.Dv10, Dv50, and Dv90 are the average particle sizes at 10%, 50%, and 90% of the cumulative size distri bution, respectively.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis The microstructure of raw and agglomerated milk powders was inv estigated using SEM (Genesis-1000, EmCrafts, Seoul, Korea).Powder samples were att ached to SEM stubs using double- sided adhesive carbon tape and coated with gold under vacuum prior to observation.SEM analysis was performed at an a ccelerating voltage of 20 kV and 200× magnification.
Flowability and cohesiveness measurement The flowability and cohesiveness of the WPI-fortified SMP parti cles were measured using the Carr index (CI) and Hausner ratio (HR), respectively, which were calculated using the bulk density (ρ bulk) and tapped density (ρ tapped). ρ bulk and ρ tapped were calculated as the mass/volume ra tio of the powder samples befor e and after 1,250 taps, respec t i v e l y , u s i n g a t a p d e n s i t y volumeter (BT-301, Bettersize In strument, Dandong, China), and CI and HR values were calculated from Eqs.(3) and (4): C I=ρ௧௔௣௣௘ௗ − ρ ௕௨௟௞ ρ௧௔௣௣௘ௗ ×1 0 0 ( 3 ) H R=ρ௧௔௣௣௘ௗ ρ௕௨௟௞ ( 4 ) Powder flowability (%) based on the CI value was classified as follows: <15 very good, 15–20 good, 20–35 fair, 35–45 bad, and >45 very bad.Powder cohesiveness based on the HR valu e is classified follows: <1.2 low, 1.2–1.4 intermediate, >1.4 high (Atalar and Yazici, 2018; Szulc and Lenart, 2013).
Wettability measurement The wetting time (t w) was used to evaluate the hydration properties of raw and aggl omerated WPI-fortified SMP particles. As described by Atalar and Yazici (2018), the required time to complete wetting and immersion of 5 g powders in 100 mL Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.42, No.6, 2022 918 distilled water (23±1℃) was measured as the wetting time.Color analysis Color analysis of the raw and a gglomerated WPI-fortified SMP sa mples was performed using a “Colorflex” colorimeter (Hunter Associates Laboratory, Reston, VA, USA), which was cali brated using a standard white tile (x=80.32; y=85.18; z=89.28) before measurement.The results were described using E asyMatchQC ver 4.77 software in terms of L* (lightness index) ranging from 0 (dark) to+100 (light), a* (redness index) ranging from –60 (green) to +60 (red), and b* (yellowness index) ranging from –60 (blue) to +60 (yellow), according to th e international color system.
Rheological measurement of rehydrated milk beverages Agglomerated milk powder (60 g) was dissolved in 180 mL of drin king water to investigate th e rheological properties of the rehydrated milk beverages. Rheological measurements were pe rformed using a HAKKE Roto Visco-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a cone-plate geomet ry, and data were obtained at a shear rate range of 0.4 to 100 s–1.The data were fitted to the f ollowing power-law model to desc ribe the flow behavior of rehydrated solutions: σ=K γ ሶ௡ ( 5 ) where σ is the shear stress (Pa), γሶ is the shear rate (s–1), K is the consistency index, and n is the flow behavior index .The apparent viscosity (η a,10) of the sample was calculated at 10 s–1 using the K and n values obtained from the power-law model.Statistical analysis All experiments were conducted i n triplicates, and data are exp ressed as the mean±SD.
Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test using the IBM SPS S Statistics 24 software suite (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The significance l evel was set at p<0.05.Results and Discussion Particle size and distribution Particle size and distribution are important characteristics of food powders and can be closely linked to other physical properties, such as density, flowability, and reconstitution.T he particle size distribution profiles of the raw and agglomera ted WPI-fortified SMP samples are presented in Fig.1, which shows that the particle size distribution of raw SMP and WPI- fortified SMP samples moved to the large size region as they ag glomerated.These results indicate that the particle size of th e powders was increased by the fluidized bed process.In principl e, fluidized bed agglomeration is performed by spraying the binder solution onto the powders flowing upward by airflow.
Thi s process consists of three steps: 1) wetting, 2) coalescence, and 3) consolidation (Atalar and Yazici, 2021; Lim et al., 2021 ). The raw particles are fluidized by rising hot air, and their surfaces are wetted by a sprayed binder solution, which makes t hem bind together by the formation of liquid bridges owing to the collision of sticky particles, which then turns liquid brid ges into solid bridges, leading to the anchoring of the agglomerated particles (Atalar and Yazici, 2019; Barkouti et al ., 2013).Therefore, the fluidized bed process can effectively Fluidized Bed Agglomeration of WPI-Fortified SMP 919 produce agglomerated milk powder.The particle size and distribution values (D[3,2], Dv10, Dv50, Dv90, and span) of the raw and agglomerated WPI-fortified SMP samples are listed in Table 1.The D[3,2] values of raw pow ders exhibited similar D[3,2] values, which were about 61.6–63.0 µm.
But, the D[3,2] values of the agglomerated powder s increased in the order SMP7/WPI3 (147%)<SMP8/WPI2 (164%)<SMP9/WPI1 (186%)<SMP (208%), and other particle size val ues (Dv10, Dv50, and Dv90) also showed a similar tendency. In general, fluidized bed agglomeration is influenced by powder composition, particle size, binder type, and process conditions (Barkouti et al., 2013; Park and Yoo, 2020).In this study, the agglomera tion of the WPI-fortified SMP samples may be strongly affected by the powder composition beca use the fluidized bed agglomeration process was carried out under the same conditions.According to Atalar and Yazici ( 2019), hydrophilic sugars such as lactose can improve the wettability of food powders, promoting the formation of liquid bridges between particles.Therefore, SMP with high lactose content can be more easily agglom erated by the fluidized bed pr ocess than WPI with lo w lactose content.
One purpose of fluidized bed agglomeration is to achieve a unif orm particle size distribution. In general, the span value is used to assess the homogeneity and polydispersity of food powde r s ( C h e v e r e t a l ., 2 0 1 7 ) .T h e s p a n v a l u e s o f r a w W P I - fortified SMP samples decreased from 2.02 to 1.84 with the incr ease in WPI ratio.This result can be explained by the increase in Dv50 values, as shown in Table 1.After the fluidiz ed bed process, the span values of the agglomerated SMP and Fig.1.Particle size distribution of raw and agglomerated WPI-fortifi e d S M P p a r t i c l e s w i t h d i f f e r e n t S M P / W P I r a t i o s .(A) SMP, (B) SMP9/WPI1, (C) SMP8/WPI2, and (D ) SMP7/WPI3.WPI, whey protein isolate; SMP, skim milk powder.Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.42, No.6, 2022 920 WPI-fortified SMP samples were in the range of 1.58–1.63, and t he span values of the agglomerated powders were much lower than those of the raw powders.
This reduction in span val ues indicates a narrow size distribution with homogenous particles. From these results, it was found that WPI enrichment could slightly suppress the agglomeration of SMP by the reduction of liquid bridges between particles due to the decrea se in hydrophilic sugar content, but it was concluded that the fluidized bed agglomeration process can effectively improve the particle size distribution.Particle morphology SEM analysis was used to visualize the microstructures of the S MP and WPI-fortified SMP pa rticles.Fig.2 shows the SEM images of the raw and agglom e r a t e d p o w d e r s w i t h d i f f e r e n t s t r u c t u r e s .T h e r a w S M P ( F i g .2 A ) a n d W P I ( F i g .2 B ) showed small spherical particles , which are typical of milk pow ders produced by spray dryers (Atalar and Yazici, 2019).
Some particles were connected; thus, the particle size distribu tion was approximately 30–200 mm, consistent with the particle size distribution results shown in Table 1. The fluidized bed a gglomeration process had noti ceable effects on the size and s ha pe o f t he S M P a n d W P I - f or t i f i e d S M P pa r t i c l e s .T he S M P w a s e ffectively agglomerated by the fluidized bed process, which led to a grape-like structure with high porosity (Fig.2C ).This result can be attributed to the better intermolecular interactions between the SMP particles during the fluidized bed process.Generally, a highly por ous structure can improve the reconstitution properties of fo od powders because it allows wat er to penetrate easily into th e void spaces of agglomerated particles (Ji et al., 2015; Lee and Yoo, 2021; Wu et al., 2020) .WPI-fortified SMP particle s (Fig.
2D) were partially agglomerated by the fluidized bed process, resulting in the for mation of smaller agglomerated particles than agglomerated SMP particles. This result may be due to the lower compatibilit y b e t w e e n t h e S M P a n d W P I p a r t i c l e s , w h i c h c a n b e explained by the lower wettability of the WPI particles than th at of the SMP particles, as described previously.These results suggest that the microstructure o f S M P i s s t r o n g l y a f f e c t e d b y the fluidized bed agglomeration process and that the enrichment of WPI particles can i nfluence the agglomeration of SMP particles.Density, flowability and cohesiveness The physical properties of the raw and agglomerated WPI-fortifi e d S M P s a m p l e s a r e p r e s e n t e d i n T a b l e 2 .T h e b u l k Table 1.

CI, Carr index; HR, Hausner ratio. Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.42, No.6, 2022 922 agglomeration process, respectiv ely.These results were similar to those by Ji et al.(2017), which reported that WPI powders agglomerated using a lecithin solution as a binder.According t o Chever et al.(2017), the fl uidized bed process produces a powder with a lower density owing to additional voids caused by the formation of porous structures during the agglomeration process (Ji et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2020).Therefore, the lowe r ρbulk and ρ tapped values of the agglomerated WPI-fortified SMP particles can be attributed to the additional voids within the porous structure of the agglomerated powders by the fluidized bed process.The ability to flow easily is an important property related to transfer, weighing, storage, and blending (Lee and Yoo, 2021).The flowability and cohesiveness of food powders can be describ ed using the CI and HR, respectively.
As shown in Table 2, the CI values of the raw SMP showed good flowability (CI: 15–20 ) and increased from 18.2 to 22.5 as the WPI ratio increased, indicating fair flowability (CI: 20–25). The HR valu es of the raw powders exhibited intermediate cohesiveness (HR: 1.2–1.4) and increased wit h increasing WPI ratio.In contr ast, the CI and HR values of the agglomerated powders decreased with increasing WPI ratio, and the CI and HR values o f the agglomerated WPI-fortified SMP particles exhibited very good flowability (CI: <15) and low cohesiveness (HR: <1.2) .These results indicate that the physical properties of WPI- fortified SMP particles can be improved by the fluidized bed ag glomeration process.The improved flowability and cohesiveness of the agglomerated powders can be explained by th e increased particle size, whi ch can reduce the particle surface area and decrease friction between the particles (Lim e t al., 2021; Park and Yoo, 2020).
However, the fluidized bed process did not improve the CI a nd HR values of the agglomerate d SMP samples. This result may be due to the lower ρ bulked and ρ tapped values of agglomerated SMP particles as compared to the WPI-fo rtified particles (Lee and Yoo, 2020).From these results, it was suggested that t he physical properties of SMP p articles are greatly affected by the addition of WPI particles and that the fluidized bed agglomer ation process can effectively im prove the flowability and cohesiveness of WPI-fortified SMP particles.Wettability Wettability of powders is defined as its ability to overcome su rface tension at the interface be tween liquid and particles, and good wettability is very important for powder products beca use it is closely related to the hydration properties (Atalar a nd Yazici, 2018; Ji et al., 2017).The hydration properties of raw and agglomerated WPI-fortifie d SMP particles were shown in Fig.3 and Table 2.
The raw SMP and WPI-fortifie d SMP particles had a long wetting time (t w) of >120 s and floated on the water surface with lump formati on, as shown in Fig. 3.Accordin g to Nascimento et al.(2021), fine particles can penetrate int o spaces between large particles and lead to more compact powders .These compact particles do not allow water to penetrate inside the particles, which can form lumps and float on water s urface.In contrast, agglomerated SMP and WPI-fortified SMP particles displayed faster wetting, as demonstrated by the decr ease in wetting time to 4.33–14.3 s.The same effect was also observed in other studies of isolated protein powders, such as MPI (Wu et al., 2020), pea protein isolate (Nascimento et al., 2021), and soy protein isolate (Machado et al., 2014).This imp roved wettability can be explained by the large particle size and the porous structure of aggl omerated particles.
As previous ly described, the large porous structure can allow water to easily penetrate into the void spaces of agglomerated particles , facilitating the wetting of powders (Custodio et al., 2020; W u et al., 2020). Although wetting time of agglomerated WPI-fortif ied SMP particles increased from 4.67 s to 14.3 s with increasing WPI ratio, they showe d the faster wetting time than the instant criterion (<20 s) des cribed by Chever et al.(2017) .Consequently, the rehydration pr operties of WPI-fortified SMP p articles can be effectively improved by the fluidized bed agglomeration process.Fluidized Bed Agglomeration of WPI-Fortified SMP 923 Fig.3.Wettability of SMP and WPI-fortified SMP particles with differ ent SMP/WPI ratios.(A) Raw powder, (B) agglomerated powder.SMP, skim milk powder; WPI , whey protein isolate.Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.42, No.
6, 2022 924 Color properties Color is a significant factor i n the sensory aspect of food pow ders, and the changes in the col or parameters (L*, a*, and b*) of raw and agglomerated powders are summarized in Table 3. The L* decreased with an increase in the WPI ratio, and the agglomerated powders had lower L* than the raw powders, indicat ing that the color became darker owing to fluidized bed agglomeration.Similar results were observed by Lee et al.(202 1), who reported that the L* of carboxymethyl cellulose powder decreased from 88.3 to 83.7 after fluidized bed agglomer ation.This result can be attributed to the increase in particl e size.According to Sakhare et al.(2014), larger particle size can decrease the whiteness of food powder.In the case of b*, agglomerated powders have higher values than raw powders, indic ating that fluidized bed agglomeration can increase the yellowness of milk powders.
The higher b* of agglomerated powde rs can be explained by the brown pigments produced by the Maillard reaction, which can be accelerated at high tempera tures because of hot air (Zulueta et al., 2013). Consequently, the color properties of dairy-based food powders can be influen ced by the fluidized bed agglomeration process, which can lead to a decrease in the L* and an increase in the b* owing to the Maillard reaction.Flow behavior of rehydrated milk beverages The shear stress (σ) versus shear rate ( γሶ) data were applied to the power law model to describe the flow b e h a v i o r o f rehydrated milk beverages with ag glomerated powders, and the ex perimental results were well fitted to the power law model with high r2 (0.97–0.98), as shown in Table 4.The rehydrated solutions wit h the SMP and SMP9/WPI1 samples exhibited Newtonian behavior with flow behavior index values of close to 1 (n=0.98–1.02).
The n valu e decreased slightly with increasing WPI ratio, and the rehydrated solution with the SMP7 /WPI3 sample showed little shear-thinning behavior (n=0.76). Similar results were reported by Bazinet et al.(2004 ), who found that the WPI dispersion exhibited shear-thinning behavior above a concentration of 10%.This shear-thinning beha vior of the WPI solution can be explained by the breakdown of weak bonds, such as hydrogen and ionic bonds, in the protein network at high shear rates, which can lead to a decrease in viscosity (González-Tello et al., 2009; Tang et al., 1993).The apparent viscosity (η a,10) and consistency index (K) values of rehydrated solutions were also i nfluenced by the enrichment of WPI and increased with an increase in the WPI ratio.The Table 3.

According to Morison and Mackay (2001), the viscosity of whey protein solutions is governed by whey protein and depends on the protein concentration. Therefore, th ese results indicate that the S MP/WPI ratio can influence the flow behavior of reh ydrated milk beverages with agglomerated WP I-fortified SMP samples.Conclusion The high-protein dairy powder is being consumed to prevent sarc openia.However, spray-dried milk proteins have poor flowability and wettability owing to their fine particle sizes and high inter-particle cohesive forces.This study aimed to investigate the effect of fluidized bed agglomeration on SMP fo rtified with WPI with varying SMP/WPI ratios to resolve these problems.The fluidized bed process increased the particl e size distribution, and SEM images of the agglomerated particles showed a grape-like structure with high porosity, whi ch can contribute to good reconstitution properties.
The CI and HR values of agglomerated WPI-fortified SMP particles exhibited very good flowability (CI: <15) and low cohesiveness (HR: <1.2) compared to raw WPI-fortified SMP particles. In addition, agglomerated WPI-for tified SMP particles exhibited the faster wetting time than the instant criterion (<20 s).How ever, the level of agglomeration decreased with increasing WPI ratio, resulting in a slight decr ease in particle size and wett ability.Therefore, it can be recommended that the SMP with a high ratio of WPI (SMP7/WPI3) requires the longer agglomeration time in the fluidized bed process.However, the extension of agglomeration time should be carefully considered from a col or point of view, because the fluidized bed process can decease the CIE L* and increase the CIE b* due to the Maillard reaction.
Although WPI enrichment can slightly suppress the agglomeration of SMP particles, the fluidized bed agglomeration process can effectively improve the physical properties such as particle size distribution, flowability, and wettability of WPI-fortified SMP particles. I n a d d i t i o n , t h e r e h y d r a t e d m i l k beverage with the agglomerated SMP7/WPI3 sample (60 g in 180 mL water) can be expected to provide approximately 19.3 g of whey protein and a total of 31.7 g of proteins.Therefore, these results may be useful in formulating protein-fortified dairy powders with be tter instant property.Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no poten tial conflicts of interest.Table 4.
