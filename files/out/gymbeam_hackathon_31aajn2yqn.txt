The phytochemically-rich extract of rhizome (CZM) was capable to inhibit proliferation of target cells in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 150 μg/ml. Dysregulation of intercellular antioxidant defence system resulted to surges in ROS and RNS level, increased calcium concentration and compromised mitochondrial membrane potential.Nucleus got affected, cell cycle dynamics got impaired while clonogenicity and migration ability diminished.Expression of viral oncogenes E7 and E6 decreased significantly.Accumulation of toxic cell metabolite and decrease in level of essential ones continued.Finally, alteration in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling route was followed by onset of autophagic cell death concomitant with the upregulated expression of Beclin1, Atg5-12 and LC3II.Curcumin and a novel crystal as well as few phyto-fractions were isolated by column chromatography.
Of these, curcumin was found to be most potent in inducing cytotoxicity in SiHa while two other fractions also showed significant activity. Thus, CZM acted against SiHa cells by inducing autophagy that commences in compliance to the changes in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway mainly in response to oxidative stress.To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of Curcuma zanthorrhiza Roxb.inducing autophagy.Keywords Cancer biology · Cell culture · Flow cytometry · Cytotoxicity · Western blot analysis Introduction According to global cancer statistics, 2020, the estimated numbers of new cases and deaths due to cervical cancer throughout the world have increased to 3.2% and 3.3%, respectively.In India, cervical cancer is ranked as the third most commonly occurring cancer accounting for about 18.3% of new cases in 2020 (Mehrotra and Yadav 2022).Surgeries, radiation therapy and chemotherapy to immuno- therapy are used, mostly in combinations, to treat cervical cancer.
However, due to intense side effects of these methods such as suppression of bone marrow, gastrointestinal lesions, neurologic dysfunctions, cardiac toxicity and other chronic side effects (such as digestive distress, nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite), there is a need in finding other safer approaches. One such approach is to use phytoextract or phytocom- pounds (such as phytosterols, polyphenols and terpenoids) since it is known from various reports that use of such nat- ural products can induce comparatively lesser side effects.Curcuma zanthorrhiza originated in Indonesia, more spe- cifically in Java Island, and hence is commonly known as the Java Turmeric or Java Ginger.
Among the Javanese people, it is commonly known as ‘temulawak’ and is con- siderably used in preparation of ‘Jamu’—a widely popular * Rita Kundu kundu_rita@yahoo.co.in 1 Centre of Advanced Study, Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, 35, Ballygunge Circular Road, Kolkata 700019, India 2 Department of Chemistry, Taki Government College, Taki 743426, West Bengal, India 3 Department of Life Sciences, Christ University, Bangalore 560029, Karnataka, India 3 Biotech (2023) 13:8 1 3 8 Page 2 of 23 natural health drink. Indonesian Drug and Food Authority have established the plant as a distinguished therapeutic plant with stellar prospects (Ervintari et al.2019).Its use in wound healing (Kim et al.2007) as well as in abro- gating inflammation has been extensively recorded in conventional folk medicine (Jantan et al.2021).Further, such claims have been scientifically established with mod- ern research.
In Malaysia, the plant has been long used in domestic treatment of diverse maladies ranging from rheumatism to hepatitis. At certain regions, it is also uti- lised for curing liver and gastrointestinal ailments (Jan- tan et al.2021).In Java, it has risen to prominence as a unique immunity booster and its immunomodulatory capa- bility has been reinforced with exemplary safety profile (Setyati et al.2019).It is also used as a flavouring as well as colouring spice in traditional delicacies.On the other hand, locals of Javanese community, especially the Eng- gano, Urug and Madura tribes, further identify this plant with the cure of haemorrhoid, vaginal discharge and other gynaecological disorders (Rahmat et al.2021).Interest- ingly, these problems often are associated with prognosis of cervical cancer.Curcuma zanthorrhiza Roxb.is rich in flavonoids and harbours xanthorrhizol, a sesquiterpe- noid of bisabolane-type that is present in no other species of Curcuma, thereby making it unique.
In HPV (Human Papillomavirus)-18-positive HeLa cells (human cervical carcinoma), its ethanolic extract caused apoptotic cell death (Ismail et al. 2005).Thus, anticarcinogenic activity of the plant has been inquired only marginally and it has the potential to be a promising candidate to be explored further.Among the non-apoptotic modes of cell death, autophagy often secures the foremost position.It is an essential eukary - otic degradative process that primarily aids in quality con- trol of organelles and cellular macromolecules.Although this conserved process helps in maintaining homeostasis by recycling important components for ideal functioning of the cell, dysregulation of autophagy has been observed under abnormal physiological conditions.In cancer, it acts dichoto- mously as in some cases it facilitates tumour progression while in others it assists in overriding the latter.
Presently, the modulation of autophagic process in cancer cells under the influence of phytotherapeutic extracts is being exten- sively evaluated. In this study, we have observed that methanolic extract of Curcuma zanthorrhiza rhizome induces oxidative stress- mediated autophagy that ultimately leads to cell death in cervical cancer cell line SiHa (HPV 16-positive).We have also tried to isolate the most effective bioactive compound from the extract that might be responsible for actuating cell death in SiHa.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Curcuma zanthorrhiza inducing autophagic cell death in a cancer cell line.Materials and methods Detailed experimental methods have been provided in sup- plementary file S1.Preparation of plant extract The rhizomes of Curcuma zanthorrhiza Roxb.
(reference specimen number CALI122535, present in Calicut Uni- versity Herbarium) were obtained from garden of Calicut University in the month of October 2017 and were authen- ticated by Prof. Mamiyil Sabu, Head of the Department of Botany, Calicut University.They were cleaned, cut into fine slices and air-dried in shade to obtain thin flakes.These were then ground to get fine powder of the sample.The dried and powdered sample was extracted in metha - nol (CZM), ethyl acetate (CZE), petroleum ether (CZP) and distilled water (CZW) individually (2 g of powdered sample in 20 ml of solvent) for 7 days.The respective extracted solutions were then dried/lyophilized for 3 days to obtain the crude test samples and stored at – 20 °C until further use.For the cytotoxicity tests, the extracts were further dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (100 mg/ ml) while for the phytochemical assays they were dis- solved in respective parent solvents.

Results Selective cytotoxicity of CZM in SiHa is dose dependent Except the CZW, all other extracts of Curcuma zanthor - rhiza were capable of inducing cell death in SiHa though their cytotoxicity varied. As deduced from MTT reduc- tion assay, CZM was the most potent against SiHa as it showed the lowest IC50 value of 149.37 µg/ml correspond- ing to treatment time of 24 h.However, 76.1% HEK293 human embryonic renal cells remained viable when they were treated for 24 h with 150 µg/ml CZM, thus indicating towards the latter’s selective cytotoxicity.Depending on the observations made from MTT reduction assay, three doses of CZM (100, 200 and 300 µg/ml) were chosen for further study.When CZM-treated SiHa cells were subjected to Trypan blue dye exclusion assay, similar results were observed where around 45% of cells remained non-viable at 100 µg/ ml and the non-viability increased with an increase in con- centration (Fig.1).
CZM attenuates cell proliferation and clonogenicity Proliferative potential of CZM-treated SiHa cells was also hampered as observed from changes in cell cycle dynamics. There was an increase in sub-G0 cell percent- age from 1.54 ± 0.46% to 13.99 ± 0.31% when subjected to 300 µg/ml CZM for 24 h, while G0-G1 decreased from 73.55 ± 0.46% to 47.16 ± 0.97%, thus indicating anti-pro- liferative capacity of CZM.Simultaneously, S phase cell percentage increased from 5.00 ± 0.94% to 11.92 ± 0.7% and G2-M phase cells increased from 17.99 ± 2.67% to 23.24 ± 2.45% pointing towards cell cycle arresting capa- bility of CZM at both S and G2-M phases (Fig.2d, e).Such disruption of cell cycle was corroborated with nuclear as well as cellular morphological changes as detected by Hoechst 33,258 (Fig.2a) and Haematoxy - lin–Eosin staining (Fig.S2), respectively.
CZM induced remarkable nuclear condensation as percentage of brightly fluorescing Hoechst-stained nuclei increased from 1.25% in control set to 15.37% in 300 µg/ml CZM-treated set. Similarly, chromosomal erosion became evident with the presence of nuclei with very faint fluorescence.Besides, morphology of SiHa cells altered from spindle-shape to highly condensed and rounded ones.Halo assay also showed that the halo formed due to nuclear damage, increased in area up to about 73% in 300 µg/ml CZM-treated set compared to the untreated control set after a treatment time of 24 h (Fig.2b, c).Exposing SiHa cells to CZM for 24 h hindered their ability to cover wound area markedly in a dose-dependent manner.With respect to control set that filled up 87.06% of the scratch, CZM between 100 to 300 µg/ml covered only 10.69% to 1.97% at the end of 24 h (Fig.3a, b).
Clonogenicity of SiHa cells also decreased with an increase in dose by 0.47- to 0.09-fold when treated with a tenth of CZM doses for 7 days (Fig. 3c, d).Fig.5 CZM affected functional integrity of mitochondria and ham- pered bioenergetics.a Fluorescence microscopy images of Rhoda- mine 123-stained SiHa cells after treatment of CZM for 3 h showing decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) with respect to untreated control set.Scale represents 50 µm.b and c Histograms and corresponding bar graph, respectively, showing dose-dependent decrease in percentage of red fluorescing population in CZM-treated SiHa cells indicating loss of MMP as detected by flow cytometric analysis.CCCP represents positive control set in both (a) and (b).d and e Images of immunoblots showing changes in expression of pro- teins associated with maintaining mitochondrial integrity directly (BCl2, Bax) and glycolytic flux indirectly (E6, E7) in CZM-treated SiHa cells.γ-Actin served as loading control.

RNS level was also found to increase in parallel as NO content got upregulated from 19.5 µM at 3 h to about 45.67 µM at 24 h (Fig. 4c).Concurrently, the intracellular Ca2+ concentra- tion also increased from 1.39- to 1.64-fold (Fig.4d).The antioxidant system got compromised with the assault of the increasing ROS and RNS levels.This was evident as the activity of enzymes like CAT, SOD, GR, GST, GPX, ThR, Grx and Prx diminished in a dose-dependent manner.However, the decrease in activity was more prominent at 24 h.Activities of CAT and SOD were lowered to 2.05 and 0.16 U/ml/mg at 24 h, respectively (Fig.4e, f), at the high- est dose while those of GR, GST and GPX that function in glutathione redox system decreased to 0.37, 0.09 and 0.01 U/ml/mg (Fig.4g, h, i).The content of non-enzymatic GSH also declined up to 7.32 to 8.21 µg/ml (Fig.4j).Reduction in activities of ThR, Prx and Grx was to 0.03-, 0.54- and 0.09-fold, respectively (Fig.4k, l, m).
The sharp fall in the cellular antioxidant cycle resulted in magnification of levels of oxidative stress markers like LOOH, MDA and carbonyls to 0.18 µM/mg, 7.02 µM/ml/mg and 0.35 nM/ml/mg, respec - tively (Fig. 4n, o, p).Dysregulated mitochondrial function and imbalance in cellular energy homeostasis Irregularities in mitochondrial membrane potential of SiHa cells in response to CZM were evident at all the doses.It was visualised through microscopic analysis that the fluores - cence of Rhodamine 123-stained cells steadily dropped in a dose-dependent manner with respect to control cells due to the MMP loss (Fig.5a).
Such pronounced impact on MMP was also re-emphasised in flow cytometric analysis that indicated the percentage of cells with red fluorescing JC-1 aggregates depicting the presence of active mitochondria decreased from 95.65% in control set to 3.65% in the highest dose whereas percentage of cells with green fluorescing JC-1 monomers increased from 5.71% to 90.09% showing greater abundance of mitochondria with lowered membrane poten- tial under CZM treatment (Fig. 5b, c).In accordance with this, the expression of BCl2 and Bax, the two mitochondrial membrane proteins which play pivotal roles in cell survival and death, also changed in comparison with untreated sets as shown in the immunoblots (Fig.5d).Changes in expres- sion of HPV-associated proteins E6 and E7, which indirectly assist in regulating glycolytic flux, were observed (Fig.5e).
An imbalance in the cellular energy homeostasis was also noticeable in the targeted cells in a time- and dose-dependent decrease in activity of intracellular LDH and lowering of intermediates of aerobic glycolysis like pyruvate and lac- tate. LDH activity diminished to 3.43 and 16.3U/ml/mg with respect to control at 3 h and 24 h after CZM application, respectively (Fig.5f).Pyruvate and lactate concentration lowered to 0.47- and 0.002-fold, respectively (Fig.5g, h).Concentrations of citrate and malate that are involved in syn- thesis of important cellular macromolecules also changed.Citrate got reduced to 0.062-fold while malate concentration altered to 0.04-fold (Fig.5i, j).The upregulated expression of AMPK as observed by immunoblotting also indicated that internal bioenergetics of the CZM-targeted cells got grossly modified (Fig.5e).Methylglyoxal, a toxic by-product of aer - obic glycolysis, increased twice in concentration (Fig.5k).
CZM initiated acidic vacuole accumulation and upregulated key autophagic proteins Fluorescence microscopy as well as flow cytometric analysis revealed greater accumulation of acidic compartments in dose-dependent manner as there was a rise in percentage of red fluorescing cells when stained with AO (Fig. 6a, b).At the highest dosage, percentage of such cells was about 86% which was comparable to 62.85% in HBSS-treated sets (Fig.6c).MDC staining indicated autophagosome forma- tion in the treated sets got enhanced as the fluorescence increased by 2.12-, 1.6- and 1.53-fold at the three chrono- logical doses (Fig.6d, e).On co-treatment of 300 µg/ml Fig.6 CZM induced autophagic cell death in SiHa.a Upper panel showing increasing accumulation of acidic compartments (orange- red specks) in acridine orange (AO)-stained SiHa cells treated with CZM for 24 h with respect to untreated control.HBSS represents positive control set.

Upregulation was also observed in expression of Beclin1, Atg5-12 and LC3II, the key autophagic protein (Fig. 6g).NAC can partially rescue the CZM‑treated cells MTT assay indicated that pre-treatment with NAC increased IC50 of CZM by 38% at 24 h (Fig.7a).Microscopy using DCFDA showed a decrease in ROS level under similar con- dition (Fig.7b, c).Microscopy utilising AO/EtBr staining method showed that N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) exercised a partial cytoprotective activity on CZM-treated SiHa cells as percentage of red fluorescing cells decreased to about 25% suggesting lesser accumulation of acidic bodies (Fig.7d).Simultaneously, EtBr-positive cells were reduced by 15%.Intracellular [Ca2+] was also reduced to 1.26-fold (Fig.7e).Halo area around nuclei was observed to be diminished by almost ninefold (Fig.7f, g).NAC is a synthetic aminothiol precursor of GSH and helps in dissipating excessive ROS and RNS.
As NAC was partly successful in averting cell death, it could be stipulated that oxidative stress was largely but not the only responsible factor behind CZM-mediated autophagy in SiHa cells. Phytochemical characterisation of CZ extracts CZ extracted with methanol (CZM), ethyl acetate (CZE), petroleum ether (CZP) and water (CZW) individually were subjected to quantitative spectrophotometric assays, and it was estimated that CZM had the highest total phenol content of about 157.66 ± 0.513 mg GAE/g dry wt.(Fig.8a) and total flavonoid content was highest in CZE with 921.29 ± 0.42 mg QE/g dry wt.followed by 555.81 ± 0.4 mg QE/g dry wt.in CZM (Fig.8b).The greatest total tannin content was found in CZM with 152.39 ± 0.494 mg CE/g dry wt (Fig.8c).Total terpenoid content was CZM 7.67 ± 0.002 mg LE/g dry wt.(Fig.8d), and total alkaloid content was about 5.93 ± 0.6 mg SE/g dry wt (Fig.8e).The petroleum ether and aqueous extracts did not fare well with respect to phytochemical contents.
Since CZM was selected for further studies on its cytotoxicity against SiHa, it was put through different mass spectrometric analysis methods. The HRLCMS and GCMS analyses of CZM presented an elaborate picture of its phy - tochemical profile.Those also confirmed that CZM consists of a range of bioactive phytocompounds (Supplementary Table 1) that belong to diverse phytochemical classes.Chro- matograms illustrating their proximation according to the retention times are shown in Fig.8f, g and h.Isolation, identification and characterisation of cytotoxic fractions in CZM against SiHa The CZM extract yielded several fractions when subjected to silica gel column chromatography.When cytotoxic potential of these fractions was checked through MTT assay, it was found that two fractions (FR-I, FR-II) induced cell death against SiHa with IC50 values of 43.78 and 56.49 µl/ml.
HRLCMS analysis of FR-I in ESI positive mode showed that it consists majorly of terpenes and terpenoids (41.66%) like cucurbitacin S and isogermafurene and vitamin D3 derivatives (21.49%) while in ESI negative mode indicated the presence of alkaloid (100%) (Fig. 9).GCMS analysis showed that this fraction was made of mainly terpenoids of which the most abundant was xanthorrhizol (44.9%).FR-II was found to be made primarily of esters and fatty acids like ethyl 2E,4Z-hexadecadienoate elaidolinoleic acid and isopalmitic acid amounting to about 81.98% as revealed through HRLCMS done in ESI negative mode (Fig.9).Two phytocompounds were also isolated from CZM as pure crystals through column chromatography.
One of the crystals has been distinguished as (1E, 6Z)- 1,7-dimethyl- 3-oxo-4-(propan-2-ylidene)-2,3,4,5,8,9-hexahydroazeein- 1-ium (CCDC Submission ID: 2,082,214), isolated for the first time from Curcuma zanthorrhiza Roxb., while the other has been identified as curcumin (CCDC Submission ID: 2,082,213), the marker phytocompound of Curcuma spe- cies (Fig. 10a, b).1H NMR spectra of 2,082,213 (300 MHz, CDCl3, 298 K, δ/ppm): 7.56–7.62 (d, 1H, H-7, J = 18), 7.26 (s, 1H, Phenolic –OH), 6.92–7.14 (m, 3H, H-1, H-4, H-5), 6.45–6.50 (d, 1H, H-8, J = 15), 5.80–5.85 (d, 2H, 2 × H-10), 3.95 (s, 3H, 3 × H-11).One singlet peak at 1.55 ppm is due to impurity of CH3Cl, came from CDCl3 solvent used in 1H NMR (Fig.10e).Curcumin was found to be most cytotoxic against SiHa with an IC50 value of 25.4 µg/ml.Fig.7 NAC exerted partial cytoprotective effect in CZM-treated cells.

*P < 0.01, **P < 0.001, ***P < 0.0001◂ 3 Biotech (2023) 13:8 1 3 8 Page 14 of 23 3 Biotech (2023) 13:8 1 3 Page 15 of 23 8 Discussion Autophagy has been reported to occur in cancer cells mainly to maintain homeostasis by removing damaged cytosolic organelles and biomolecules. However, under deleterious circumstances such as in the presence of elevated levels of cellular ROS the basal level occurrence of autophagy is found to largely cross over the threshold level, thereby lead- ing to cell death instead of promoting cell survival.The first distinguished observation upon treatment of SiHa cells with CZM was the increment of both intercel- lular ROS and RNS levels (Fig.4).Under normal condi- tions, these are generally produced via ongoing normal cel- lular functions.For example, superoxide is formed through actions of cellular enzymes like cytochrome P450 per - oxidases, NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase (Su et al.2019).Nitric oxide synthase also acts as a major source of NO.
In order to keep a check on excessive accumulation of these species, the cancer cells possess tightly regulated and largely interconnected redox systems made of enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic antioxidants. The cytosolic zinc and copper-dependent and mitochondrial manganese-dependent superoxide dismutases (SODs) convert superoxide to hydro- gen peroxide and oxygen.Catalase of peroxisomes breaks down hydrogen peroxide to form water and molecular oxy - gen.Among the non-protein thiols in cell, glutathione is more abundant.Reduced glutathione acts as an integral cofactor during the antioxidant reactions requiring exchange of thiol and disulphide groups.The hydroxyl radicals (OH˙) and singlet oxygen get scavenged mainly through these low molecular weight non-enzymatic scavengers.Glutathione reductase (GR) maintains GSSG/GSH concentration ratio in cell as it catalyses NADPH-mediated conversion of oxidised glutathione disulphide (GSSG) to its reduced form.
Thiore- doxin reductases (TrxRs) are involved mainly in reduction of Thioredoxin (Trx), a redox protein. This occurs in a NADPH-dependent manner (Mustacich and Powis 2000).The TrxR/Trx system also sustains the GSH pools besides the GR.Glutathione peroxidase, a selenoenzyme present in mitochondria and cytosol, detoxifies lipid peroxides and H2O2 through electron-donating activity of GSH (Jiao et al.2017).Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) play role in conju- gating the GSH to different exogenous as well as endogenous reactive electrophile components and thus protect the mac- romolecules in cell (Townsend et al.2003).Peroxiredoxins participate in reducing lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) and scavenging hydrogen peroxides present in free state while electrons get withdrawn from thioredoxin.Glutaredoxins are also proteins with sulfhydryl groups and cooperate with the Trx system via hydrogen donation (Vernis et al.2017).
How - ever, the redox system of SiHa cells when treated with CZM has been found to be dysregulated as activities of the differ - ent antioxidant enzymes diminished while concentration of non-enzymatic antioxidant GSH also got lowered (Fig. 4).The resultant imbalance got exacerbated in a time- dependent manner and ultimately led to a total collapse of the redox homeostasis.It is known that the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species associate among themselves to form more such components as themselves.On the other hand, they interact with the macromolecules and affect the latter.H2O2 reacts with nitrite to form free radical of nitrogen diox- ide.OH˙ aggressively and unselectively oxidises DNA bases and disturbs the double helix.Singlet oxygen engages with proteins by oxidising their side chains and causes their con- formational changes.NO in the presence of O ̅ ˙ converts to peroxynitrite that creates the unstable lipid nitrate intermedi- ates.
Thus, adverse rise in ROS levels leads to formation of noxious adducts of different cellular biomolecules. The free radicals extricate electrons from lipids to form further reac- tive intermediates like lipid hydroperoxides and malondial- dehyde.The cellular and organellar membranes with more polyunsaturated fatty acids are more sensitive to such lipid peroxidation (Su et al.2019).Similarly, proteins get oxi- dised to form harmful carbonyls.The build-up of ROS and RNS in the CZM-treated SiHa cells due to the progressive inactivation of cellular redox system also led to increased concentration of different oxidative stress markers such as lipid hydroperoxides, malondialdehyde and protein carbon - yls (Fig.4).These in turn inflict further damage to the cell.Of these, the lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) affect more seriously, since, when decomposed through reduction via one-electron system they lead to further propagation of chain reactions that again continue peroxidation of other lipids.
The LOOHs react with oxygen radicals to form peroxyl (LOO˙) and alkoxyl (LO˙) radicals. Lipids constitute about 50% of the cell membrane.The accumulation of deleterious lipid adducts alters fluidity of biomembranes resulting in a harsh drop in membrane integrity and eventual malfunction- ing of membrane proteins.Such loss of membrane integ- rity in the treated sets was evident from the dose-dependent increase in percentage of the Trypan blue-positive cells (Fig.1).Fig.8 Phytochemical composition of CZ extracts.a Total phenol content shown as GAE (gallic acid equivalent)/g dry wt.b Total fla- vonoid content shown as QE (quercetin equivalent)/g dry wt.c Total tannin content shown as mg CE (catechin equivalent)/g dry wt.d Total terpenoid content shown as mg LE (linalool equivalent)/g dry wt.e Total alkaloid content shown as mg SE (strychnine equivalent)/g dry wt.

Occurrence of such oxidised bases poses more problems to mitochondrial DNA since the latter lacks protection rendered by histones as well as the enzymatic nucleotide excision repair system. Incidence of chromosomal erosion was noticeable as the number of faintly fluorescing Hoechst-stained nuclei of treated sets got raised with the doses and the diameter of the nuclear halos as visualised via halo assay also increased (Fig.3).Apart from maintaining the redox balance, the redox systems of the cell coordinate and contribute together either directly or indirectly to preserve numerous critical cell survival func- tions.For instance, Trx helps in activating ribonucleotide reductase that aids in DNA replication as well as DNA repair mechanisms through formation of deoxyribonucleotides.Glutaredoxins are known to participate during biosynthe- sis of DNA.
They also perform during biogenesis of Fe-S clusters which are involved in continuing functions of DNA polymerases, DNA primase and glycosylases (Vernis et al. 2017).Thus, functional dysregulation of the redox system is capable of negatively affecting cell cycle dynamics and proliferative potential of cell.This is supported by disruption of cell cycle progression and proliferation in SiHa cells in response to CZM (Fig.3).Besides nucleus, mitochondria were also imposed with the injurious influences of the unabated piling of cellu - lar ROS, as was implied by a lowering of mitochondrial membrane potential in the cells treated with CZM (Fig.5).Furthermore, the disturbed status of Bax and Bcl2 proteins’ equilibrium as observed from the immunoblots also pointed towards the mitochondrial damage.
Mitochondrial mem- brane phospholipids when affected by the ROS often lead to disaggregation of Complex I and III, increase leakage of electrons within the intermembrane space and decrease membrane potential (Perillo et al. 2020).With a hike in mitochondrial depolarization, a derail- ment in bioenergetics becomes inevitable as observed in this study.Cancer cells exhibit high rate of fatty acid synthesis with an equally high rate of mitochondrial β-oxidation for fatty acid catabolism.The catabolic products are necessary for protecting unattached cancer cells from death by anoikis and aiding a better cell migration process (Li et al.2021).In all probability, with the absence of soundly functioning mitochondria in bulk within the affected SiHa cells, the β-oxidation process got hindered.
This can be a cause for the stalled migratory potential of the targeted cells, besides the fact that curcumin, the major flavonoid present in CZM in an appreciable quantity, is known to inhibit functions as well as expressions of different matrix metalloproteinase proteins (Bachmeier et al. 2018) .HPV infection induces several alterations in the metabolic profile of the cell, of which the most prominent is the change in glycolytic flux.In the highly proliferative cancer cells, Warburg effect is chiefly observed wherein they generate ATP through aerobic glycolysis bypassing the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and produce lactic acid.E6, an important ‘oncoplayer’ in SiHa cells, secures c-Myc from disintegration through o-linked-N-acetylglucosaminylation and helps in upregulation of hexokinase-2 (HK2) transcrip- tion.
It also renders p53 inactive which in turn leads to downregulation of miR-34a that inhibits activity of LDHA whose primary function is to convert pyruvate to lactate. Thus, E6 promotes aerobic glycolysis in infected cervical cancer cells as HK2 acts as a key enzyme of glycolysis.E6/ E7 also downregulate expression of miR-143-3p that nor - mally keeps glycolytic flux under check by opposing HK2 expression.In the CZM-treated SiHa cells, it was detected that intracellular LDH activity decreased with time while the concentrations of both pyruvate and lactate dropped (Fig.5).One of the underlying reasons for this might be the down- regulation of E6 and E7 expressions in the targeted cells as observed from immunoblot analysis.
The lowering of phos- phorylated AKT also supports considerable obstruction to the occurrence of glycolysis since AKT hyperactivation as is seen in HPV-positive cells is the major contributor in acti- vating the leading glycolytic enzymes like phosphofructoki - nase and overexpression of membrane glucose transporters like GLUT1(Li and Sui 2021). The resultant loss of energy homeostasis in the cells was also apparent from the reduc- tion of intermediates like citrate which is required for cho- lesterol and fatty acid synthesis in cytoplasm (Koundouros and Poulogiannis 2020) and malate which is essential for amino acid biosynthesis.The unavoidable bane of aerobic glycolysis is formation of methylglyoxal which is an unstable, electrophilic dicar - bonyl compound.It associates chiefly with the basic amino acids of protein molecules to produce hazardous advanced glycation end products (AGEs).Under normal conditions, Fig.

In the absence of properly operational GLO/GSH axis, methylglyoxal accumulates in the cell and initiates cytotox - icity.In HT22 nerve cells, methylglyoxal treatment for 18 h resulted in an increase in Trx1 loss, the activation of AMPK, a decrease in phosphorylation of mTOR and an increase in active LC3, all indicating towards onset of autophagy (Dafre et al.2017).In retinal ARPE-19 cells, methylglyoxal leads to an increment in autophagy flux and inhibits cell prolifera- tion (Chang et al.2015).In this study, the concentration of methylglyoxal has been found to increase in time-dependent manner and it might be one of the factors responsible for inducing autophagy in the CZM-treated cells.
The process of autophagy starts with the formation of autophagosome, a double membrane-bound vesicle to internalise targeted cellular components, followed by fusion with lysosome, and culminates with degradation through the hydrolytic enzymes. Microscopic and flow cytometric analyses indicated towards dose-dependent escalation of autophagic attack on SiHa cells by CZM since the propor - tion of cells stained with AO and MDC increased.Beclin1, a crucial member that when active, participates in autophago- some initiation and maturation, remains bound through its BH3 domain to inhibitory BCl2.Expression of Beclin1 also increased with a concomitant decrease of BCl2.Bax which has been reported to enhance autophagy through lysosomal membrane permeabilization also got upregulated.LC3II, the biomarker of autophagy, and Atg5-12 which is required for LC3II maturation showed an amplified expression in both treated and positive control sets.
It is the phosphatidy - lethanolamine conjugate of cytosolic LC3 that is inducted Fig. 10 Characterisation of crystals isolated from CZM through silica gel column chromatography.a 2-dimensional structure of (1E, 6Z)- 1,7-dimethyl-3-oxo-4-(propan-2-ylidene)-2,3,4,5,8,9-hexahydroa- zeein-1-ium (CCDC Submission ID: 2,082,214).b Corresponding 3-dimensional crystallographic structure analysed by XRD method.c 2-dimensional structure of curcumin (CCDC Submission ID: 2,082,213).d Corresponding 3-dimensional crystallographic struc- ture analysed by XRD method.e 1H NMR spectrum of curcumin iso- lated from CZM 3 Biotech (2023) 13:8 1 3 Page 19 of 23 8 to nascent phagophore membrane and gets degraded by lysosomal enzymes when autophagosome merges with lysosome to form autolysosome.Thus, this turnover of LC3II indicates a properly functioning autophagic activity.
Hydroxychloroquine inhibits autophagic flux by disorgan- izing Golgi-endolysosome system and preventing fusion between autophagosome and lysosome, without affecting acidity of the latter (Mauthe et al. 2018).Application of HCQ and resultant rise in both LC3II expression and per - centage of MDC-positive cells also pointed towards induc- tion of autophagy by CZM.Oxidative stress and subsequent injury seem to be the major underlying causes for this ini- tiation of autophagy since with application of antioxidant NAC the cytotoxicity of CZM to SiHa diminished to some extent.Enhanced internal ROS level is capable of activating AMPK which in turn inhibits anti-autophagic mTOR via monitoring the TSC1/TSC2/Rheb axis and simultaneously phosphorylates ULK1 so that the latter can properly func- tion as the key scaffold protein to trigger autophagosome maturation.pPI3K phosphorylates the downstream protein AKT which then activates mTOR to inhibit autophagy.
It was observed that in the CZM-treated as well as nutrient- starved cells expression of pPI3K and pAKT decreased while those of AMPK and mTOR increased. Elevated ROS also oxidises the cysteine protease Atg4 which initiates and promotes formation of LC3II (Zhang et al.2016).Further, the magnified ROS and ensuing membrane depolarisation activate lysosomal TRPML1 channels which trigger Ca2+ release from lysosomes.The rise in Ca2+ concentration prompts transcription of genes involved in calcineurin- activated and TFEB-mediated induction of autophagy and co-ordinated biogenesis of lysosomes.Primarily, the high [Ca2+] amplifies autophagic rate in a two-pronged manner.On one hand, it signals activation of AMPK via CaMMKβ while on the other it prompts DAPK to phosphorylate BCl2, thereby rendering Beclin1 free to participate in autophago- some formation.
Thus, it is likely that the leap in [Ca2+] in CZM-treated cells in response to enhanced ROS also con- tributed to orchestrating autophagic cell death. The potential of CZM regarding onset of autophagy in SiHa due to loss of redox homeostasis, sequential upswing in oxidative stress (Fig.11) and eventual inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR (Fig.12) signalling cascade can be jus- tified by the presence of an array of phytochemicals that can function in a similar manner.Quantitative phytochemical characterisation revealed the presence of phenols, flavo- noids, terpenoids, alkaloids, tannins, etc., in CZM, and this was validated by HRLCMS and GCMS analyses also.The Fig.11 CZM destabilised redox homeostasis of SiHa cells by adversely affecting the intercellular antioxidant defence system comprising intercon- nected cycles of glutathione, glutaredoxin, peroxiredoxin and thioredoxin.
This resulted in an increase in levels of ROS and different oxidative stress mark - ers in the target cells 3 Biotech (2023) 13:8 1 3 8 Page 20 of 23 Fig. 12 Probable mode of action of CZM on SiHa cells repre- sented schematically.CZM increased the intercellular ROS that in turn affected the lipid bilayer, mitochondria and nucleus lead- ing to increase in lipid peroxidation product, i.e.MDA, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and condensation and erosion of nuclear material.CZM also decreased concentration of cellular metabolites like citrate, malate, lactate and pyruvate and increased concentration of calcium.The high calcium level phosphorylated BCl2 probably via DAPK, and thus, Beclin was set free to initiate autophagosome formation probably through VPS34 complex.CZM also increased expression of Atg5-12 and LC3II that also helped in autophagosome formation.AMPK contributed by inhibiting mTOR phosphorylation and activating Beclin through ULK complex.
Fur - ther mTOR was inactivated through inhibition of PI3K/AKT. Lyso- some fused with autophagosome to form autolysosome while acti- vated Bax from damaged mitochondria aided in proper functioning of lysosome.Proteins marked in green were upregulated, those in red were downregulated, and colourless ones were not experimentally studied here 3 Biotech (2023) 13:8 1 3 Page 21 of 23 8 notable phytocompounds that probably helped in cytotoxic- ity of CZM and their bioactivities have been discussed in Supplementary Table 5.Silica gel column chromatography of CZM led to separation of two crystal compounds and five fractions.Of these, curcumin was observed to have lowest IC50 value against SiHa as deduced from MTT assay (Fig.S3) and can be concluded as the major bioactive phytocom- pound present in CZM.
It will be important for future research to clarify the rel- evance of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in the benefi- cial effects of Java Ginger, given the importance of the AhR in the pathophysiology of most cancers, including cervical cancers (Wang et al. 2021 ), as well as the role of the AhR driving the ‘exhaustion’ in natural killer cells and CD8 + T cells, and therefore altering the interaction of the cancer cells with immune cells in the tumour microenvironment (Ander - son 2020).The AhR has recently been proposed as a marker of poor prognosis in cervical cancers (Wang et al.2021 ).This may link to the data above given the role of the PI3K/ Akt pathway in the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3β), with active GSK3β involved in the degradation of the AhR, as shown in cervical cancer cell lines and other cancers (Yang and Chan 2021 ).
On the other hand, AhR, via the induction of cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1), also 'backward' converts melatonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS). This NAS in turn activates the Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), thereby increasing the proliferation and survival of cancer cells and cancer stem cells (Anderson 2019).It was earlier reported that curcumin can act as a potential target of AhR in anti-inflammatory signalling pathway, as LPS-induced IL6 and TNF α were attenuated in curcumin- treated rat astrocytes (Lin et al.2022).It will be interesting to determine as to how the Java Ginger extract and especially the curcumin in it is interacting with these proliferation and inflammatory processes via AhR activity alteration.Conclusion Thus, in conclusion, this study demonstrates that sesquiter - penoid-rich rhizome extract of the nutritious Curcuma zan- thorrhiza Roxb.possesses merit as a natural agent having selective cytotoxicity against SiHa cervical cancer cells.
The observations also pointed towards the dose-dependent anti- migratory and anti-clonogenic activities of the same which further accentuate its anti-proliferative property. The altera - tion in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and destabilisation of intracellular redox defence mechanism, as depicted through lowered activity of different enzymatic antioxidant systems and decreased level of non-enzymatic thiols, acted in a feed- back loop to trigger cell membrane damage, nuclear material degradation and mitochondrial function impairment.Besides, downregulation of the HPV-marker proteins E6 and E7 also aided in the process and bruised the bioenergetic homeostasis of the cells.The cumulative outcome of such injuries mediated by the extract ultimately expedited autophagic cell death in the SiHa cells.Thus, this report provides preliminary evidence supporting the traditional use of the plant by the indigenous Java tribes against gynaecological tumours associated with cervical cancer.
Further, the phytochemical repertoire of Cur - cuma zanthorrhiza as detected through mass spectroscopic and column chromatographic analyses validated the versatility of this salient Zingiberaceous plant of immense ethnomedicinal importance. Although its ability to bring about death in other cancer cell types has not been highlighted here, yet the circuit of its mode of action as presented may help in future research to establish the plant as an effective and safe anti-cancer arse- nal and enhance its position as a functional food.Supplementary Information The online version contains supplemen- tary material available at https:// doi.org/ 10.1007/ s13205- 022- 03415-9.Acknowledgements SN would like to acknowledge Prof.Mami- yil Sabu, University of Calicut for kindly providing the rhizome of Curcuma zanthorrhiza Roxb.
