Evaluation of polyherbal formulation in broilers fed high energy diet: Implications on zootechnical parame- ters, fat accretion, and serum L-carnitine levels. J Adv Vet Anim Res 2022; 9(1):166–174.ABSTRACT Objective: The current broiler trial was planned to assess the effects of Kolin Plus™, a polyherbal formulation (PHF), on performance, protein and fat accretion, and serum L-carnitine (LC) levels in broilers fed a high-energy diet (HED).Materials and Methods: A total of 500 1-day-old Cobb 430 male chicks were assigned to 5 treat- ment groups consisting of 10 replicates, with 10 birds in each replicate (n = 100).Group G1 was a negative control fed HED, and group G2, a positive control supplemented with synthetic choline chloride (SCC) 1,500 gm/ton in HED.Groups G3, G4, and G5 were supplemented with PHF in HED at 400, 500, and 750 gm/ton feed, respectively (PHF400, PHF500, and PHF750).
Results: The PHF produced a dose-dependent numerical improvement in body weight, feed con- version ratio, livability, and the European Production Index. There were no changes in carcass nitrogen and protein accretion, whereas a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.05) in carcass fat and fat accretion was observed in the SCC and PHF groups.Moreover, PHF showed a significant increase in serum LC levels.
Conclusion: Kolin Plus™ improves performance parameters akin to SCC by improving fat metabo- lism and mobilization by enhancing serum LC levels and restoring normal fat accretion.ARTICLE HISTORY Received December 16, 2021 Revised January 31, 2022 Accepted February 06, 2022 Published March 13, 2022 KEYWORDS Chickens; choline chloride; fat accretion; high energy diet; polyherbal formulation; serum L-carnitine Introduction High-energy diets (HED) have been utilized to shorten the rearing period and increase profitability in poultry, espe - cially during the finisher period, and are known to predis - pose broiler chickens to fatty liver syndrome (FLS) [1], higher abdominal fat [2], footpad problems [3], and pulmo - nary hypertension [4]. These metabolic syndromes gener - ally affect fast-growing broilers fed HED due to the methyl group donors’ deficiency in feed, culminating in excessive lipid accretion in the hepatic cells followed by liver damage [5].
This statement supported the findings that a high-calorie and low-protein diet is a prerequisite to initiating metabolic disorders in chickens [6]. The accumulation of extra fat in the abdominal and visceral areas of meat is a big problem for meat producers because fat is a waste that most people do not like.Meat producers have taken many steps to keep fat from building up, but they have had mixed results [7].Supplementation of lipotropic agents along with HED has been practiced to alleviate the detrimental effects of HED on liver health and prevent metabolic disorders.Choline is an essential lipotropic agent that prevents the accumulation of excess fat and fatty liver in chickens [8] and plays a significant role in the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine as a labile methyl donor [9].
Additionally, it is crucial for the structural maintenance of cell membranes and organelles, proper maturation of the cartilage matrix of the bones [10] , and a precursor molecule for the forma - tion of acetylcholine in the nervous system [8]. Previous studies have endorsed the addition of choline chloride in poultry diets for augmented performance parameters such as feed conversion ratio (FCR) during the finisher period and alleviated fat deposition in the abdomen of broiler chickens [11] .In addition, it was said that broiler chickens are given choline and/or L-carnitine (LC) had less FLS [12] .© The authors.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (http://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by/4.0 ) http://bdvets.org/javar/ 167 D’souza and Selvam / J.Adv.Vet.Anim.
Res., 9(1): 166–174, March 2022Choline chloride is a prevalent form of synthetic cho - line that is added to animal feed and possesses certain limitations to it, such as being hygroscopic by absorbing atmospheric moisture, causing the generation of trimethyl - amine in the gut, and accelerating the loss of essential vita - mins in the feed through oxidation [13] . Thus, researchers around the globe are focusing their efforts on the addition of herbal additives to broiler diets to counter the draw - backs of synthetic choline chloride (SCC).Several herbs and their phytochemical constituents have been employed as a substitute for SCC in animal diets and proven to exhibit activities akin to synthetic choline in poultry [8,14].Recently, LC gained popularity due to its critical role in fatty acid degradation, as the transfer of long-chain fatty acid into the mitochondria is dependent on carnitine enzymes in food-producing animals.
Diets enriched with L-carnitine reduce the fat accumulation in adipose tissue by enhancing fatty acid oxidation [15] . In addition, it has already been demonstrated that higher serum LC levels could be correlated with better meat quality in pigs [16] .Kolin PlusTM is a polyherbal formulation (PHF) made by Natural Remedies Private Limited, a company in Bengaluru, India.It is a combination of parts of two plants, Acacia nilot - ica and Curcuma longa .Extracts of these individual herbs are hepatoprotective, antioxidant, and lipotropic in vitro and live systems [17– 20].The efficacy of Kolin PlusTM was demonstrated in the choline deficiency model earlier [8], yet no scientific reports representing their efficacy in com - bination with poultry-fed HED are available.Hence, the current study aims to comparatively evaluate the effects of PHF and SCC on growth performance, protein and fat accretion in the carcass, and serum LC levels of Cobb 430 broiler chickens fed HED.
Materials and Methods Institutional animal ethics committee approval The study was carried out in concordance with the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC Number: NR/ AHS/PLT/12) guidelines. Experimental design and feeding levels A male flock of 500 Cobb 430 broiler chickens was ran - domly allotted to five groups.Group G1 was a negative control (NC) fed HED, and group G2, a positive control, supplemented with 1,500 gm/ton SCC in HED.Groups G3, G4 and G5 were supplemented with PHF in HED at 400, 500, and 750 gm/ton feed doses, respectively (PHF400, PHF500, and PHF750) to determine the optimum dose of PHF.Each dietary group had 10 replicate pens, and each pen housed 10 birds.The trial was conducted for 42 days.The birds were fed with a starter feed (1–14 days), a grower feed (15–28 days), and a finisher feed (29–42 days) in mash form, with an ad libitum supply of drinking water.
The experimental NC diet (HED) was formulated by keeping the specifications close to the prevailing industry standard, with slightly higher metabolizable energy levels and moderately lower choline content levels in the starter, grower, and finisher phases. The experimental feed’s ingre - dient composition and nutritional values are presented in Tables 1 –3.Experimental setup A polyvinyl chloride brooder (PVC), a bell-style water drinker, a feeder for chicks, and/or a jumbo feeder for the chicken were provided in all pens.The floor space and size of the experimental pen were modified based on the total number of chicks allotted in each pen, using a chick- guard made of PVC.The shed temperature was regulated between 32°C and 34°C for the first 7 days, and then grad - ually abridged by 2°C every 7 days until 42 days.The rel - ative humidity of the poultry house was maintained at 40%–70% during the study period.
Standard vaccination and management practices were followed throughout the experiment for all the dietary groups. The vaccinations included those against the infectious bronchitis disease, administered at 0 day of age (IB Ma5) at the hatchery itself, Newcastle disease (live vaccine, Clone 30) at 5 and 20 days of age, and infectious bursal disease at 12 days of age (228E; Int plus).The lighting program included 24 h of light during the first week of age and 20 h of light after that, till the completion of the trial.Evaluation of zootechnical parameters On days 1, 35, and 42, pen-wise body weight (BW) of the birds was recorded at the same time of the day without any fasting.A measured quantity of feed was offered to each pen every day in two equal divisions.Cumulative feed intake (CFI) was determined by deducting the number of orts left in each pen from the quantity of total feed offered.Then the average daily feed intake (ADFI) was determined.
FCR was calculated as a ratio between ADFI and average body weight gain (BWG). Mortality was recorded as and when it happened, and the weight of the dead birds was recorded to adjust the data accordingly.European Production Index (EPI) was calculated according to the following formula: EPI = [(100 – mortality) × (mean live weight/age) × 100]/FCR.Measurement of protein and fat accretion in the carcass At the beginning of the experiment (day-1), 10 chicks were randomly selected and euthanized.The entire breast mus - cle was separated, minced, and triturated, following which it was subjected to an analysis of nitrogen (N2) and crude fat.The values obtained in this way were considered as base-level values.At 42 days, five birds were randomly http://bdvets.org/javar/ 168 D’souza and Selvam / J.Adv.Vet.Anim.Res., 9(1): 166–174, March 2022selected from each group and killed by mechanical stun - ning, which was followed by cervical dislocation.The carcass was allowed to bleed out.
It was then scalded at 55°C with intermittent dipping for 20 sec at a time, and the feathers were plucked up using de-feathering equip - ment. Next, the carcasses were manually eviscerated and rinsed.The breast muscle was separated; half of the entire breast was minced, triturated, and subjected to analysis for N2 and crude fat.Protein (N2 × 6.25) and fat accretion were calculated based on the difference in the base level values that were used as the common source of origin for all the dietary treatments.Determination of serum L-carnitine levels The serum was separated by spinning the clotted blood at 3,000 rpm for 5 min.Following the L-carnitine assay kit (Bioassay Technology Laboratory, Shanghai, China), 40 µl of samples and 10 µl of anti-L-carnitine antibodies were added to the sample wells.This was followed by adding 50 µl of streptavidin-HRP to the sample and standard wells; the solution was mixed thoroughly and incubated at 37°C for 1 h.
Then the microplate was washed five times by soaking it in wells with wash buffer for 30 sec between each wash and blotted onto absorbent paper. Substrate solutions A and B were added in quantities of 50 µl each to all wells, and the plate was incubated for 10 min at 37°C in the dark.The reaction was then terminated using a stop solution (50 µl) and immediately measuring the optical density (OD) at 450 nm.Statistical analysis For data related to performance traits, the replicates were considered the experimental units, while for the remain - ing data, individual observations were considered a single experimental unit.The raw data were cleaned up and pre - sented as the mean of 10 replicates in each group.They then went through a one-way analysis of variance and the Tukey’s B Test (IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
RESULTS Impact of PHF on zootechnical parameters in broilers fed HED The results of PHF supplementation on performance parameters in broilers fed HED were evaluated on days 35 and 42 and are presented in Tables 4 and 5. There was no difference in the BW of birds among the groups Table 1.Feed formula—starter (HED—NC group).

Similarly, liva - bility and EPI improved in SCC and PHF supplemented groups compared to NC, and the improvement observed in PHF750 was on par with SCC 1500. Impact of PHF on protein and fat accretion in broilers fed HED The results of PHF and SCC supplementation on the pro - tein and fat accretion in broiler chickens are specified in Table 6 .No statistically significant difference was noticed in protein accretion across the groups, yet numerical improvement was observed in the SCC and PHF supple - mented groups.However, fat accumulation was signifi - cantly reduced in the SCC, PHF400, PHF500, and PHF750 groups compared to NC.Impact of PHF on serum L-carnitine levels in broilers fed HED The outcome of PHF and SCC supplementation on serum LC levels of broilers fed HED is demonstrated in Figure 1 .PHF750 produced a statistically significant increase in serum LC levels compared to other treatment groups, whereas SCC, PHF400, and PHF500 showed a numerical increase compared to NC.
DISCUSSION The fat is mobilized in low-density lipoproteins from hepatic to extrahepatic cells, where they get metabolized or accumulated, mediated by an essential lipotropic factor, choline [21] . Consequently, the excess energy from fat gets diverted more towards the accretion of muscle protein and body mass than carcass fat, resulting in better performance traits and lower lipid content in the carcass and visceral Table 2.Feed formula—grower (HED—NC group).

However, the fat content in the NC group’s carcass was higher than other dietary interventions. A similar trend was noticed in the case of fat accretion in the carcass during 1–42 days of age, with the NC group show - ing significantly higher fat accumulation compared to the remaining dietary groups ( p < 0.05).This result suggests Table 3.Feed formula—finisher (HED—NC group).

The reduction in fat and fat accretion of the carcass observed in the SCC and PHF supplemented groups could be attributed to their lipotropic action; this is in accordance with literature findings reporting the reduc - tion in abdominal and liver fat when broilers were fed a diet supplemented with an herbal source of choline [23] . Saeed et al.[24] reported that including herbal formula - tions and lipotropic agents in the feed reduces the adverse metabolic implications of a high-energy diet in poultry.Moreover, PHF at 400 gm/ton feed reduced abdominal fat and liver fat in broilers fed a low choline diet [8].Furthermore, the dietary groups supplemented with PHF400, PHF500, and PHF750 revealed higher serum LC levels than SCC and NC.The improvement in serum LC levels displayed by PHF400, PHF500, and PHF750 was 45.3%, 42.3%, and 90%, respectively, comparatively more significant than SCC (12.6%).
Our results are in concordance with the reports wherein supplementation of L-carnitine significantly improved the production per - formance of chickens during the early stages of chicken growth and decreased the abdominal fat during the fin - isher period [25] . L-carnitine plays a critical role in energy generation as it shuttles the long-chain acyl-CoA to the inner mitochondrial membrane for beta-oxidation [26] .In addition, L-carnitine is reported to increase the activ - ity of the enzyme hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase and decrease the concentrations of serum triacylglycerol and non-esterified fatty acid in chickens [27] , as well as decrease lipid accretion in the carcass of young pigs [28] .In the current study, the birds grew quite well by day 42, and the average BW was more than the breed stan - dard for male birds (3,044 gm).As a result, the feed intake (Table 5 ) was higher and more than the breed standard (5,073 gm in 42 days).
Regarding BW, feed consumption was similar to that of other dietary treatment groups. Only subtle differences were observed between the groups con - cerning the ADFI calculated during the starter, grower, and finisher stages.In comparison with NC, the supplementa - tion of SCC (1,500 gm/ton) and PHF (400, 500, and 750 gm/ton) improved the BW by about 40, 22.8, 24.5, and Table 5.Impact of PHF on CFI and average daily feed intake in broilers fed HED.GroupCFI (gm) Average Daily Feed Intake (gm) Day 1–35 Day 1–42 Day 1–35 Day 1–42 NC 3489.4 5102.4 99.70 121.49 SCC 3514.2 5089.3 100.40 121.17 PHF400 3505.9 5128.3 100.17 122.10 PHF500 3538.6 5090.4 101.10 121.20 PHF750 3503.4 5058.1 100.10 120.43 SEM 13.71 15.21 0.376 0.36 p-value 0.798 0.804 0.797 0.804 SEM—Standard error of means.Table 6.Impact of PHF on accretion of the protein and fat in broilers fed HED.

Statistical insignifi - cance notwithstanding, some interesting numerical dif - ferences were observed in this study. The PHF750 group was found to have the highest BW across all the treatment groups while consuming the lowest amount of feed-in 42 days.This result is in concordance with the findings of Farina et al .[29] , Ryan et al.[30] , and Emmert and Baker [31] , who observed the dose-response of choline on BWG of birds fed a low choline diet.These findings affirmed that the positive response of birds’ BW and feed efficiency to choline supplementation and natural lipotropic agents could be effectively used as a good indicator of efficacy in broiler chickens fed HED.Furthermore, livability varied between the treatment groups.Mortalities observed during the experimental period were mostly accidental, and post-mortem examina - tions did not reveal any specific pathognomonic lesions to identify the cause of the mortality.
Nevertheless, SCC and PHF supplementation in HED produced better livability that was 4%–5% higher than NC. In addition, SCC and PHF supplemented groups also displayed a better EPI owing to higher BW, improved FCR, and better livability.However, a comparable or relatively better EPI was observed in PHF750 compared to SCC (450.1 vs.443.4).This result signifies that PHF at 750 gm/ton feed effectively replaces 1,500 gm SCC in the broiler ration and exhibits a simi - lar SCC performance as reflected by EPI.Calderano et al.[10] , Khose et al.[16] , and Khosravinia et al.[32] showed an improvement in survivability, feed efficiency, and body weight when a natural source of choline was used to sub - stitute synthetic choline in bird diets, and this agrees with our study findings.The liver is involved in many homeostatic and meta - bolic functions and is considered a biochemical factory responsible for the detoxification, metabolism, and excre - tion processes in birds and mammals [33] .
Nutritional modifications affect the liver and influence the nutrient metabolism in avian species. Thus, we have prepared the herbal formulation comprising A.nilotica bark and C.longa plant parts, demonstrated choline-like functions in broilers fed a choline-deficient diet [8].These individual plants, rich sources of polyphenols and curcuminoids, respectively, were proven to have hepatoprotective activity in rats.In another study, A.nilotica was proven to possess a hepatoprotective effect, ameliorating acetaminophen-in - duced hepatotoxicity in rats [34] .The addition of C.longa extract increases the liver betaine content.It improves liver lipid metabolism by affecting the transmethylation path - way and the osmotic regulation of hepatocellular hydra - tion, thereby protecting the liver from different stressors [35] .Chandrasekaran et al.
[36] confirmed the lipotropic and anti-lipogenic activity of PHF and SCC in the rat model of methionine-choline deficiency (MCD) diet-induced hep - atosteatosis and the oleic acid-induced lipogenesis assay in HepG2 cell lines, respectively. The PHF consisting of A.nilotica and C.longa is reported to positively modulate specific genes involved in growth promotion and improve the performance parameters in broilers fed a choline-defi - cient diet [37] .These observations suggest that the hepa - toprotective, lipotropic, and anti-lipogenic activity of PHF contributes to improved growth parameters.At the same time, the decrease in carcass fat accretion in the current study could be attributed to elevated serum L-carnitine levels.
The results from this study ascertain that the PHF under investigation (Kolin Plus™) positively influences the performance of broilers similar to SCC by improving the fat metabolism and mobilization by enhancing the serum LC levels and restoring normal fat accretion and better per - formance traits. Therefore, Kolin Plus™ can be explored as a substitute for SCC in poultry diets.Conclusion The supplementation of PHF in HED significantly increased serum L-carnitine levels.It decreased fat accretion, indi - cating an improved fat metabolism and mobilization with a subsequent increment in the zootechnical parameters of broilers.Kolin Plus™ supplementation improves the per - formance traits of broilers similar to SCC by improving fat metabolism and mobilization by enhancing serum LC levels and restoring normal fat accretion.Moreover, PHF at 750 gm/ton feed could replace 1,500 gm/ton of choline chloride (SCC, 60%) in high-energy broiler feeds.
Though there is a lack of an exact correlation between carcass fat content and serum L-carnitine concentration, closer scru - tiny reveals that perhaps with lower serum L-carnitine levels, fat accretion was higher. However, further investiga - tions are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Kolin Plus™ and its role in fat metabolism and mobilization in chickens.Figure 1.Impact of PHF on serum L-carnitine levels in broilers fed HED.Data are expressed as the mean of 3-5 birds from each dietary treatment.abValues with dissimilar superscripts differ significantly ( p < 0.05).http://bdvets.org/javar/ 173 D’souza and Selvam / J.Adv.Vet.Anim.
