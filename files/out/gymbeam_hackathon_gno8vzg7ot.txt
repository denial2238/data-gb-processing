QoL was measured at baseline, after six and 12 months using the population-speciﬁc Dementia Quality-of-Life (D-QoL) to assess overall QoL and the generic Short-Form 12mental and physical component scales (SF12-MCS and SF12-PCS) to assess health-related QoL. Results Baseline levels of QoL were relatively high.Modiﬁed intention-to-treat analyses revealed no positive main intervention effect of walking or vitamin supple- mentation.In both men and women, ratings of D-QoL-belonging and D-QoL-positive affect subscales improvedwith 0.003 ( P= 0.04) and 0.002 points ( P= 0.06) with each percent increase in attendance to the walking pro- gram.Only in men, SF12-MCS increased with 0.03 points with each percent increase in attendance ( P= 0.08).Conclusion Several small but signiﬁcant improvements in QoL were observed with increasing attendance to the walking program.No effect of vitamin B supplementationwas observed.

Moreover, MCI is associated with poor physical health andhigh risk of ADL dependence [ 3,4]. Since both cognitive and physical decline belong to the most important deter- minants of QoL in community dwelling elderly subjects[5], subjects with MCI are likely to be susceptible to a decrease in QoL.The number of adults with MCI is increasing consider- ably due to the aging population.For multiple reasons, it is important to prevent a decrease in QoL.Apart from the personal beneﬁts, a high rated QoL also reduces medicalconsumption and helps to maintain independency as long as possible [ 6].This in turn may relieve signiﬁcant others, caregivers and medical society in general.For this reason,attention should be paid to possible interventions contrib- uting towards a higher level of overall QoL and it’s mental and physical components.In this respect, physical exerciseand vitamin supplementation are interesting interventions worth investigating.
Regular participation in moderate intensity aerobic training is reported to be beneﬁcial inimproving QoL and wellbeing, which is an important as- pect of QoL [ 7,8]. Since walking is the most prevalent physical activity among older adults [ 9], improving QoL by increasing the time spent on moderate intensity walking seems promising.Indeed, a community based walking program signiﬁcantly improved both the physical andmental components of health-related QoL in older adults (n= 582) [ 10].Inconclusive evidence has been reported on the inﬂuence of vitamin B supplementation on QoL.Different aspects of QoL were not responsive to short term supplementation (range 4–12 weeks) with different doses and combinations of B vitamins in men and women[11–13].Not much is known about QoL in community dwelling elderly with MCI.Moreover, no trials on the effect ofexercise and vitamin B supplementation on QoL have been carried out yet in adults with MCI.
The FACT-study (Fo- late physical Activity Cognition Trial) was developed toexamine the effect of these interventions on cognition [ 14]. Aspects of QoL were measured as a secondary outcome.In the present paper, the effectiveness of 1 year moderateintensity walking (two sessions of 60 min per week) and daily vitamin supplementation (5 mg folate, 50 mg vitaminB6 and 0.4 mg B12) on both overall QoL and it’s health- related components is examined in community dwelling older adults with MCI.We hypothesize that 1 year mod- erate intensity walking beneﬁts QoL.Concerning the effectof vitamin supplementation, this paper should be consid- ered as explorative.Methods Study designThe study was designed as a randomized, placebo con- trolled intervention trial, based on a two-by-two factorial design.The study-protocol has been described in detailelsewhere [ 14] and was approved by the VU University Medical Center medical ethics committee.
Written in- formed consent was obtained from all participants. Participants In a medium-sized Dutch town community dwelling sub- jects aged 70–80 years with MCI were identiﬁed using apopulation based two-step-screening [ 15].The operational criteria for MCI according to the criteria of Petersen et al.[1] and additional inclusion criteria for the RCT are de- scribed in Table 1.Subjects were not paid to participate in the study.RandomizationAfter the baseline interview, subjects were randomly as- signed to the interventions using the statistical computer program SPSS.Intervention groups were: (1) walkingprogram or placebo activity program; and (2) vitamin B supplementation or placebo supplementation.Randomiza- tion was stratiﬁed for physical activity level at baseline inminutes per day as measured by the LASA physical activity questionnaire [ 22].For the ﬂow of participants see Fig.1.
Exercise intervention Subjects assigned to the walking program (WP) partici- pated twice a week 60 min in group-based moderate intensity walking during 1 year. Each session consisted of a warming up, moderate intensity walking exercises and acooling down.The WP was based on ‘Sportive Walking,’ an existing aerobic walking program [ 23] aimed at improving cardiovascular endurance.Therefore, durationand intensity of the walking exercises increased gradually during the program.Sessions took place outdoor in muni- cipal parks.Subjects not assigned to the WP participated in1138 Qual Life Res (2007) 16:1137–1146 123 Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation in the trial Operationalization of Petersen criteria for MCI (1–5) and additional inclusion criteria for the RCT (6–12) 1.Memory complaints (answer yes to question ‘do you have memory complaints’, or at least twice sometimes at cognition scale of Strawbridge [16] 2.

Vitamin supplementation (FA/B12/B6) Subjects in the vitamin supplementation group took one pill containing 5 mg vitamin B11 (Folic Acid), 0.4 mgvitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) and 50 mg vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine-hydrochloride) daily during 1 year. This vita- min supplement is available on prescription in The Neth-erlands.Subjects randomized to the control group took an identically looking placebo pill.The pills were packed in blister packs for 1 week, which were labeled for each dayof the week.Compliance with the vitamin supplementation was veriﬁed by pill counts in returned blister packs during the intervention.Outcome measures Baseline data on sociodemographic and background vari- ables were collected using a postal screening questionnaire.The measurement of other baseline variables, as reported in Table 2, has been described elsewhere [ 14].
In the present manuscript a distinction was made between ‘overall quality of life,’ referring to a subjects overall enjoyment of life and ‘health-related quality of life,’ referring to health-relatedfactors affecting quality of life. The term QoL was used as an umbrella term for both overall and health-related QoL.The population-speciﬁc Dementia Quality of Life ques- tionnaire (D-QoL) [ 24] was used to assess overall QoL and the generic Short Form 12 (SF12) [ 25] to assess health- related QoL.The D-QoL is a 29 item measure especially developed for elderly with cognitive decline and dementia.The participant is asked about how much they enjoyedactivities that were reported to be important for elderly such as ‘watching animals.’ Moreover, the frequency of certain positive and negative feelings such as ‘lovable’ or‘worried’ were asked for.Finally, they were asked to rate their overall quality of life.
The participant was instructed to choose the best ﬁtting answer from ﬁve item responsescales. The answers were divided into ﬁve domains of QoL measuring sense of aesthetics, feelings of belonging, neg- ative affect, positive affect/humor and self esteem.A meanscore ranging from one to ﬁve was calculated for these subscales and for the total D-QoL.A higher score indicated better quality of life.Median internal consistency reliabil- ity of the D-QoL was 0.80 and median test–retest reliabilitywas 0.72 in a sample of 95 older adults with different stages of cognitive decline [ 24].The SF12 consists of 12 items measuring eight concepts of both mental and physi-cal health, i.e., physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, energy, social functioning, role emo- tional and mental health.These concepts are subdivided into two summary scores using a norm-based criterion: i.e., mental and physical component summary scales (SF12-MCS and SF12-PCS).
The mean score is 50 with a standard deviation of 10. For example, a score of 60 corresponds to a-QoL rating of one standard deviation above the averageratings in the general population.Test retest reliability for the SF-12 MCS was 0.76 in a sample of 187 adults in the United Kingdom and 0.77 in a sample of 232 adults in theUnited States.Reliability coefﬁcients of the SF-12 PCS in these populations were 0.86 and 0.89, respectively [ 25].In the present study, measurement took place during a per-sonal interview at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.Both the D-QoL and the SF-12 were administered by a trained interviewer who was unaware of the participants’ groupallocation.Statistical analyses Differences between groups on baseline characteristics were tested using independent t-tests (normally distributed variables), Mann–Whitney Utests (not normally distrib- uted variables) and v 2(categorical variables).Within group differences were tested using dependent t-tests.
Subsequently, data were analyzed according to a mod- iﬁed intention-to-treat principle, based on data from allrandomized participants who provided data at baseline and at least one follow-up measurement. To evaluate the effects of the walking program and the vitamin supplementationon QoL, longitudinal regression analysis was used.The two follow-up measurements were deﬁned as dependent vari- able and multi level analysis with two levels was used, (1)time of follow-up measurement (values corresponding with performance after six and 12 months intervention); (2) individual.According to the study protocol [ 14], the effect of both interventions was examined independently from each other.Data were analyzed using a crude and an ad- justed model.Independent variables were exercise inter-vention and vitamin intervention.By analyzing both interventions in the same model, results were adjusted for the possible inﬂuence of the other intervention.
Moreover,all analyses were adjusted for baseline performance on the outcome measure by adding this as a covariate. In the adjusted model, education, baseline activity level, baseline1140 Qual Life Res (2007) 16:1137–1146 123 vitamin status, attendance to the exercise program and compliance with the supplementation were added as co- variates.Interaction between gender and the WP or FA/B6/ B12-supplementation was checked in the adjusted model.In the case of signiﬁcant interaction, results were reported for men and women separately.In the case of no interac- tion, gender was added to the adjusted model as an addi-tional covariate.Also, in the ‘adjusted model’ an interaction effect of the exercise program with attendance to the exercise program was checked.
Finally, data were analyzed according to the per protocol principle, including all participants who attended at least 75% of the sessions.This cut-off point is in concordance with previous exercise intervention studies in older adults [ 26,27]. Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows (release 12.0.1).A signiﬁcance level of 5% was used for between group comparisons and of 10% for interaction terms.For all analyses, regression coefﬁcients and 95% conﬁdenceintervals for the adjusted models were reported, with the regression coefﬁcients directly indicating the difference in QoL ratings between the WP and the PAP or the FA/B12/B6-supplementation versus placebo supplementation.In the case of signiﬁcant interaction, regression coefﬁcients and the 95% conﬁdence intervals of the interaction termswere reported.Results Patient characteristics Hundred-seventy-nine participants were randomized to the interventions.
Twenty-seven of them were excluded fromthe analyses, because they only provided baseline data. These subjects were more often married (71% vs.52%, P= 0.05) and less often current smokers (0% vs.14%, P= 0.04) than the remaining 152 participants who pro- vided QoL data at baseline and at at least one follow-up measurement.The latter 152 participants were included inthe analyses (see Fig.1).Their mean age (SD) was 75 (2.9) years.Fifty-six percent was male.Additional base- line variables are described per factor in Table 2.Com- pared to the PAP, the WP included fewer men (48% in WP vs.64% in PAP) and more subjects with hypertension (27% in WP vs.14% in PAP).
Ratings for both overalland health-related QoL at baseline and after 6 and 12 months intervention are presented in Table 3.N o baseline differences were observed on these measures,except for a higher rating of D-QoL self-esteem in sub- jects in the FA/B12/B6-group compared to subjects in the placebo-supplementation group.Table 2 Baseline characteristics of participants ( n= 152) Exercise intervention Vitamin intervention WP ( n= 77) PAP ( n= 75) FA/B12/B6 ( n= 78) Placebo-pill ( n= 74) Age (Mean (SD)) 75 (2.9) 75 (2.8) 75 (2.8) 75 (2.9) Gender (% male) 48* 64 56 55MMSE (Median (10th–90th &)) 29 (26–30) 29 (27–30) 29 (25–30) 29 (27–30) Education (% low/middle/high) 61/22/17 52/29/19 57/26/17 55/26/19Marital status (% living together) 75 68 69 73Physical activity a(min/day) (Median (10th–90th&)) 44 (10–155) 39 (11–120) 45 (13–155) 38 (9–111) Vitamin status (% deﬁcient FA/B12/B6)b46/8/0 48/8/0 49/9/0 45/7/0 Homocysteine statusc(% hyperhomocysteinemia) 27 23 27 23 Blood pressure (% hypertension)d27* 14 25 16 BMI (kg/m2) (Median (10th–90th p &)) 26.7 (23.1–31.5) 26.6 (23.5–32.7) 26.5 (23.3–32.8) 26.7 (23.5–31.2) Smoking (% smokers) 13 15 17 11 Number of self-reported diseases (% 0,1,2)e52/42/6 69/27/4 66/28/6 55/41/4 WP = Walking Program, PAP = Placebo Activity Program, FA/B12/B6 = Folic Acid, Vitamin B12, Vitamin B6 supplementation, MMSE = Mini Mental State Examination, Education: low = no education, primary education, lower vocational training; intermedi-ate = intermediate level secondary education, intermediate vocational training; high = higher level secondary education, higher vocational training, university training.

Especially in the ﬁrst weeks, a considerable number of subjects discontinued participa-tion, mostly because they did not want to participate in the exercise programs after all.Most frequent reasons for discontinuation of the program after the ﬁrst weeks werehealth-related problems.
No adverse events of the WP or PAP itself were reported. Adherent subjects attending at least 75% of the sessions ( n= 51) were more often living together (82% vs.65%, P= 0.03) and less physically ac- tive than non-adherers ( n= 101), (median [10th–90th percentile] was 36 [13–82] vs.44 [10–169] min/day,P= 0.02).At baseline, adherers also had lower ratings of D-QoL-belonging (3.6 [0.41] vs.3.8 [0.49], P= 0.02) and higher SF12-MCS values (56.5 [5.6] vs.53.7 [8.1],P= 0.02).Other baseline and QoL characteristics did not differ signiﬁcantly.Compliance with the (FA/B12/B6)supplementationFour participants did not return the blister packs.On the basis of pill counts in returned blister packs, median compliance (10th–90th percentile) with the FA/B12/B6-supplementation was 100 (97–100) percent and compliance with placebo-supplementation was 100 (35–100) percent.Even though median compliance in both groups was 100%,compliance in the placebo-group was signiﬁcantly lower (P< 0.05).
Eight subjects, one in the FA/B12/B6-group and seven in the placebo-group, did not take (vita-min)supplementation. Seven of them decided immediately after randomization not to participate in the interventions.The other wanted to participate in the exercise interventiononly.Two participants discontinued taking vitamin pills during the trial after reporting sleep problems and in- creased forgetfulness; one participant discontinued takingthe placebo pills after reporting not feeling well.Modiﬁed intention to treat analyses Results of the walking program and FA/B6/B12 supple- mentation are presented in Table 4.With respect to overall QoL, no positive signiﬁcant main effect of the WP or FA/ B6/B12 supplementation was found.A signiﬁcantly detri-mental effect of FA/B6/B12 supplementation was observed on D-QoL-belonging, (beta (95%CI) = –0.18 (–0.29; – 0.07), P< 0.01).A positive interaction between the WP and attendance to the WP was observed on D-QoL- belonging and D-QoL-positive affect.

With respect to health-related QoL, an interaction betweenthe WP and gender was observed on the SF12-MCS (P= 0.06) and therefore analysis for the SF12-MCS was stratiﬁed for gender. No main effects of the WP or FA/B12/B6-pills were observed.However, in men in the WP, SF12- MCS increased with 0.03 points with each percent increase in attendance ( P= 0.08).Per protocol analyses Subgroup analyses were performed in subjects attending 75% or more of the WP or PAP sessions ( n= 51, 33 men and 18 women).No between group differences were ob- served for FA/B12/B6-pills versus placebo-pills.A signif- icant positive effect of the WP compared to the PAP wasobserved on D-QoL-positive affect, beta (95%CI) = 0.23 (0.06; 0.39), P< 0.01 and a borderline signiﬁcant positive effect on D-QoL-self esteem, beta (95%CI) = 0.17 (0.001;0.34), P= 0.05.Discussion No positive main effect of walking or daily FA/B6/B12 supplementation was observed on QoL in community- dwelling adults with MCI.
However, ratings of overall QoL (i.e., feelings of belonging, positive affect) and the mentalcomponent of health-related QoL improved slightly with increasing attendance to the walking program. In a sub- group that attended at least 75% of the sessions, a beneﬁ-cial effect of the walking program was observed on positive affect and self esteem.To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst intervention study on QoL in community-dwelling adults with MCI.Whilememory complaints are reported to be negatively associ- ated with QoL in healthy older adults with subjective memory complaints [ 2], QoL ratings in our study popula- tion were already quite high at baseline.Baseline ratings on the DQOL sumscore and subscales fell ample above the midpoint of the scale, except for negative affect.Baselinescores on the SF-12MCS fell around a half standard deviation above the average in the general population and SF-12PCS fell about the average ratings.
QoL-ratings havebeen reported to decrease as the severity of cognitive de- cline increases [ 28]. The possibility exists that MCI as operationalized in the present study may not have beenserious enough to negatively inﬂuence overall and health- related QoL.In spite of the high baseline values, the QoL scales still allowed for further improvements, i.e., therewas no ceiling effect.However, it has been discussed be- fore that QoL may represent a stable concept, which is difﬁcult to change or that existing measures may not beresponsive to subtle changes [ 29].The relationship between physical activity and QoL has been studied extensively.However, it is difﬁcult todraw a clear conclusion, since various deﬁnitions and operationalizations of QoL circulate.Moreover, compar- isons between studies are being complicated by the widevariety of study populations and features of exercise intentions such as intensity, exercise mode, frequency and session and total duration [ 30].
However, Rejeski et al. [ 31] concluded in a review including 28 studies, of which 11 RCT’s, that physical activity positively inﬂu- enced aspects of health-related QoL.In a recent meta-analysis of Netz et al.

In that meta-analysis four compo- nents of wellbeing were considered, including aspects that were also measured in the FACT-study, such aspositive and negative affect, perception of physical ﬁtness and physical symptoms. In the present study no main effects of the WP were observed in the modiﬁed intention to treat analyses.First, a possible explanation for the lack of effect may be that only participants with good QoL were able to attend enough sessions.In contrast to an earlier study, no baseline dif- ferences in number of chronic diseases, physical health-related QoL and endurance were observed between adh- erers (attending ‡75% of the sessions) and non-adherers (attending <75% of the sessions) [ 32].However, adherers rated their mental health-related QoL at baseline signiﬁ- cantly better than non-adherers.
The difference was three points, which approximately equaled a difference of 5%.The possibility exists that subjects with lower mental health-related QoL were inclined to attend less sessions. Nevertheless, it is not likely that this biased our results,because non-adherers and drop-outs from the exercise programs were included in the modiﬁed intention to treat analyses.In future studies in subjects with cognitive de-cline, session attendance may be improved by informing subjects extensively about the study aims and the conse- quences of participation.Moreover, if possible with respectto logistic and ﬁnancial issues, we advice to schedule time and staff for the close personal follow-up of temporary drop-outs.Second, it has been reported that the association be- tween physical activity and QoL is lower among older adults who function at or above the norm [ 31].
By applying inclusion criteria for the present trial (e.g., community dwelling, no ADL disabilities, being able to perform moderate intensity physical activity), we presumably se-lected physically healthy and active subjects. This is sup- ported by the high baseline activity levels.Two-thirds of the participants reported to be physically active at moderateintensity for 30 min or more per day.Subjects meeting this guideline are reported to have better health-related QoL than physically inactive adults [ 8].Additionally, Netz et al.found that larger effects of exercise on wellbeing were observed in sedentary adults [ 7].However, in the present study, no interaction between the walking program andbaseline physical activity level was observed (results not presented), indicating that inactive participants did not beneﬁt more from the WP than active participants.Therefore, it is not likely that baseline physical activity level was a main cause of the lack of main effects.
Finally, inconclusive evidence is available about the intensity and exercise mode of physical activity required to beneﬁt QoL. Netz et al.[ 7] concluded that aerobictraining of moderate intensity was most beneﬁcial for wellbeing.In a cross-sectional study, it was also observed that moderate intensity physical activity was positively related to health-related QoL [ 8].In contrast, in a review by Spirduso and Cronin [ 33] no evidence of a relation- ship between exercise intensity and the rate of improvement in QoL was found.If the former would betrue, the possibility exists that the contrast between both programs in the present study would not have been large enough to induce differences in QoL.If the latter would be true, participants would have beneﬁted from partici- pation in both exercise programs regardless of intensity.Both programs may either have added to better self- efﬁcacy, or may prevented a decline in self-efﬁcacy.
The walking program by training cardiovascular endurance;the placebo activity program by training e.g., balance and ADL. Self-efﬁcacy refers to somebody’s belief that one has the capabilities to successfully manage situationaldemands and is mentioned to be a mediating mechanism for the effect of physical activity on QoL [ 7,30,34,35].Thus, the presence of the low intensity placebo activityprogram in our study may have contributed towards the lack of between group differences.Nevertheless, several outcomes improved with increas- ing attendance to the walking program.In the per protocol analyses a beneﬁcial effect was observed on positive affect.Self esteem also tended to improve.However, observeddifferences were small and approximated 5% differences from baseline QoL ratings.As a rule of thumb, a minimal change of 5% has been mentioned to signify clinical rele-vance.
To obtain a change of 5% by increasing attendance, the required increase in attendance would be 62% for D- QoL-belonging and 94% for D-QoL-positive affect and theSF12-MCS. Therefore, it can be questioned whether the observed effects are clinically relevant.No effect of the FA/B12/B6 supplementation was ob- served except for a negative effect on feelings of belong- ing.However, no theoretical rationale exists for this effect.Our ﬁndings are in line with previous RCT’s on the effectof vitamin B supplementation on aspects of QoL.Deijen et al.[ 11] observed no effect of supplementation with 20 mg vitamin B6 for 3 months on mood in healthy men (n= 76).Also no effect of supplementation with 750 lg folate, 15 lg vitamin B12 or 75 mg vitamin B6 daily for 35 days was observed on mood in women aged 65 or over(n= 75) [ 11].Finally, no effect on health-related QoL was observed of a weekly injection with 1 mg vitamin B12 for 4 weeks in adults with vitamin B12 deﬁciency ( n= 140) [13].
These ﬁndings may ﬁnd its origin in the used oper- ationalizations and measures of QoL that include very few items that directly relate to nutrition. Amarantos et al.[ 36] underline the need to develop QoL measures including items that relate nutrition to QoL.1144 Qual Life Res (2007) 16:1137–1146 123 To conclude, the walking program and vitamin B sup- plementation were not effective in improving QoL in community-dwelling older adults with MCI within 1 year.However, increasing attendance to moderate intensityphysical activity may beneﬁt certain aspects of QoL.Acknowledgments We would like to thank the municipality of Alkmaar and the ‘Stichting Fonds voor het Hart’ for ﬁnanciallysupporting project FACT and VIATRIS bv for providing us with the vitamin and placebo pills.None of these sponsors had input into protocol development, data collection, analyses, or interpretation.Weappreciate the assistance of Jos Twisk, PhD, in providing guidance onappropriate statistical methods.
