Retraction Retracted: Effects of Low-Dose Aspirin Combined with Vitamin E on the Incidence of Intrauterine Growth Restriction andHemorheological Indexes of Pregnant Women in Patients withGestational Hypertension Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine Received 27 June 2023; Accepted 27 June 2023; Published 28 June 2023 Copyright © 2023 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine.This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.This article has been retracted by Hindawi following an inves- tigation undertaken by the publisher [1].
This investigationhas uncovered evidence of one or more of the following indi-cators of systematic manipulation of the publication process: (1) Discrepancies in scope (2) Discrepancies in the description of the research reported (3) Discrepancies between the availability of data and the research described (4) Inappropriate citations (5) Incoherent, meaningless and/or irrelevant content included in the article (6) Peer-review manipulation The presence of these indicators undermines our con ﬁ- dence in the integrity of the article ’s content and we cannot, therefore, vouch for its reliability. Please note that this noticeis intended solely to alert readers that the content of this arti-cle is unreliable.We have not investigated whether authorswere aware of or involved in the systematic manipulationof the publication process.
In addition, our investigation has also shown that one or more of the following human-subject reporting require-ments has not been met in this article: ethical approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) committee or equiva- lent, patient/participant consent to participate, and/or agree-ment to publish patient/participant details (where relevant).Wiley and Hindawi regrets that the usual quality checks did not identify these issues before publication and havesince put additional measures in place to safeguard researchintegrity. We wish to credit our own Research Integrity and Research Publishing teams and anonymous and named external researchers and research integrity experts for con-tributing to this investigation.The corresponding author, as the representative of all authors, has been given the opportunity to register theiragreement or disagreement to this retraction.We have kepta record of any response received.References [1] T.Shan, P.Wang, and F.
