Methods: 412 young men (age 19 ± 1 year) entering their compulsory military service volunteered to participate in the study. The study consisted of two groups from two different military bases: Group A was studied in January and group B in July.The groups were ﬁrst compared with each other and due to statistically signi ﬁcant ( p< 0.001 analyzed with independent samples t-test) differences in physical condition (sit-up, push-up, and standing long jump-tests and testosterone levels) between thegroups, groups were analyzed separately.The serum levels of 25(OH)D, testosterone(TES), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)were analyzed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.Physical performancetests consisted of muscular ﬁtness (sit-ups, push-ups, standing long jump) and aerobic ﬁtness (12-minute-running) tests.The association of serum 25(OH)D with physical performance tests and anabolic hormones was analyzed using linearregression.
Results: After controlling for the group, body mass index, and leisure-time physical activity, serum 25(OH)D level was positively associated with aerobic and muscularﬁtness ( β= 0.15 –0.20, all p<0.05). Also, the participants with suf ﬁcient serum 25(OH) D levels ( ≥75 nmol/L) had better aerobic and muscular ﬁtness and higher TES in group B, and better upper extremity muscular ﬁtness in group A (all p<0.05).In group A, there were 166 participants with serum levels of 25(OH) D <75 nmol/L and 18≥75 nmol/L.In group B, the amounts were 92 ( <75 nmol/L) and 136 ( ≥75 nmol/L), respectively.Conclusion: Serum 25(OH)D was positively associated with both aerobic and muscular ﬁtness and those with suf ﬁcient vitamin D levels, had higher levels of TES.Thus, maintaining a suf ﬁcient serum 25(OH)D level may be bene ﬁcial for physical performance and anabolic state in young men.

After the second hydroxylation vitamin D mediates its effects through a speci ﬁc receptor in cells called vitamin D receptor (VDR) ( Haussler et al., 1998 ). Vitamin D status is assessed by serum 25(OH)D levels ( Utiger, 1998 ).The Nordic Nutrition Recommendations set 50 nmol/L i n serum 25(OH)D as a lower limit value for vitamin D suf ﬁciency ( Nordic Council of Ministers, 2014 ).However, the Global Endocrine Society ’s Practice Guidelines Committee recommends that a serum 25(OH)D level of ≥75 nmol/L is considered sufﬁcient for musculoskeletal health ( Holick, 2017 ).Vitamin D is known to have an important role in bone metabolism by promoting intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption, renal tubularcalcium reabsorption, and calcium mobilization from the bone by its mostactive form of 1,25(OH) 2D(Charoenngam et al., 2019 ).However, it is not so well-known that vitamin D may also be associated with physical performance.
In cross-sectional studi es among healthy adults and athletes, vitamin D has been found to be positively associated with muscular powerand strength ( Hamilton et al., 2014 ;Koundourakis et al., 2014 ;Hildebrand et al., 2016 )a n da e r o b i cp e r f o r m a n c e( Koundourakis et al., 2014 ;Carswell et al., 2018 ;Zeitler et al., 2018 ). Nevertheless, a na rrative review showed that the association between vita min D and physical performance in athletes has been inconclusive ( Ksia żek et al., 2019 ), while there exists only a limited number of studies among healthy adults.The bene ﬁcial effects of vitamin D on physical performance may exist through increasing blood levels of anabolic hormones such astestosterone (TES) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1).A large(n= 20 567) systematic review and meta-analysis showed an association between vitamin D de ﬁciency and decreased testosterone levels ( D’Andrea et al., 2021 ).
A positive correlation between serum 25(OH)D level and IGF-1 has been found in several observational studies as well ( Forouhi et al., 2008 ;Bogazzi et al., 2011 ;Ameri et al., 2013a ). However, studies that have examined the association of these hormones with serum 25(OH)D together withphysical performance are rare.In addition to TES level, it is importantto measure sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) as the circulatingTES is mostly bound on albumin and SHBG, and thus high SHBGcould indicate lower bioavailable TES ( Goldman et al., 2017 ).Therefore, the present cross-sectio nal study aimed to examine whether there is an association between 25(OH)D levels, physical performance (aerobic and muscular ﬁtness), and anabolic hormones in young men.It was hypothesized that serum 25(OH)D levels would have positiveassociations with physical performa nce and levels of anabolic hormones.
2 Materials and methods 2.1 Participants Young men ( n= 412; age 19 ± 1 year, height 179 ± 7 cm, body mass 75 ± 13 kg, body mass index 24.0 ± 3.7), performing theircompulsory military service, volunteered to participate in the presentstudy. Written informed consent was given to the participants after passing the military entry medical examination as healthy.The presentstudy has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the PirkanmaaHospital District, ETL code R17155, HUS/1557/2018, and the FinnishDefence Forces (AN21508, AP10027, AQ24718, AR13336).2.2 Study protocol The present cross-sectional study had two separate groups: group A(n= 184) and group B ( n= 228) in two different military units in Finland.Groups were compared and then analyzed separately due todifferences in physical performance; the participants in group A wereconducting their military service in rapid deployment forces thatrequires better physical condition than a standard military servicein Finland.
The physical performance tests were arranged during the ﬁrst 2 weeks of military service. In group A, the blood samples were drawn in the winter (January), while in another location (group B), theblood samples were drawn in the summer (July).In northern latitudecountries, such as Finland, an adequate amount of sunlight exposurefor vitamin D production in the skin is possible only between Marchand October ( Engelsen et al., 2005 ).In addition, levels of serum TES, SHBG, and IGF-1 were analyzed for evaluating the anabolic status ofthe participants.The physical performance was studied by conducting sit-up, push-up, standing long jump, and 12-min running tests.The level of ≥75 nmol/L of serum 25(OH)D was used as suf ﬁcient in the present study.Group, body mass index (BMI), and leisure-timeactivity were used as covariates.
Group was used as a covariatebecause the groups were measured during different seasons(summer/winter) and therefore, this difference can affect vitamin Dlevels through differences in sunlight exposure and further becausethere were fundamental differences in physical performance between the groups. BMI was selected due to its effects on serum 25(OH)D levels and physical performance.Leisure-time physical activity wasselected for its effect on physical performance and the possible effecton serum 25(OH)D levels if the participants spend a lot of timeoutdoors while exercising and are thus more exposed to the sun.2.3 Blood analyzes After the venous blood samples were obtained from the antecubital vein, the samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 minat room temperature for serum separation.Serum samples were thenfrozen and stored at −20 °C for later analysis.The measurements of serum 25(OH)D were performed using electrochemiluminescenceimmunoassays (ECLIA).
Levels of TES and SHBG were measuredby electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Immulite 100; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products Ltd., Gwynedd, United Kingdom). IGF-1 was analyzed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay(Siemens Immulite 2000 XPI, Siemens Healthcare DiagnosticsProducts Ltd., Gwynedd, United Kingdom).The inter-assaycoefﬁcients of variance (CV) for assays of TES, SHBG, and IGF-I were 7.0% –7.2%, 4.5% –6.2%, and 3.7% –7.4%, and that of sensitivity 0.5 nmol/L, 0.02 nmol/L, and 2.6 nmol/L, respectively.2.4 Physical performance Aerobic performance was measured by a 12-min running test, an explosive power output of the lower limbs by a standing long jump Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 02Laaksi et al.10.3389/fphys.2023.1049503 test, and dynamic muscular endurance by 1-min push-up and sit-up tests.In the 12-min running test, participants try to run as far aspossible in the given time.
The results can be used to estimate themaximum oxygen uptake (VO 2max) of the participants by using the formula: VO2max /equals(d−504 .9)÷44 .73(d = the distance covered in the given time) ( Cooper, 1968 ). In a systematic literature review and meta-analysis, where different running tests were compared, the 12- min running test was shown to be relatively accurate to estimate VO 2 max when a laboratory test is not possible ( Mayorga-Vega et al., 2016 ).Cooper (1968) demonstrated that the correlation coef ﬁcient between a directly measured VO 2max and a 12-min running test is 0.86.In addition, the reliability coef ﬁcient has been reported to be 0.96, respectively ( Penry et al., 2011 ).The purpose of the standing long jump is to evaluate the maximum and explosive power output of the lower limbs.In the present study, the standing long jump was performed three times,starting on the ground level with the legs close to each other.
Explosivebilateral takeoff was assisted by powerful swinging of the upper bodyand arms. The landing of each jump was performed bilaterally.Theresult of the best jump was expressed in meters as the shortest distancefrom the landing to the starting line, and the best result was taken forfurther analysis.Adequate recovery time (2 –3 min) between performances was used.Standing long jump test reliability coefﬁcients have been shown to vary between 0.93 and 0.96 (Markovic et al., 2004 ).Dynamic muscular endurance of the abdominal and hip ﬂexor muscles was measured by performing the sit-ups for as manyrepetitions as possible in 60 s.Sit-ups were done with eachparticipant lying on the ﬂoor with hands behind his neck and directing his elbows forward.The knees were ﬂexed at an angle of 90 deg with the legs slightly abducted.
During the movement, each participant lifted his upper body and touched his elbows to his knees.The partner supports the performer ’s ankles, following the correct performance technique and counting the number of repetitions(Viljanen et al., 1991 ). The dynamic strength and endurance of the muscles of the shoulder area and upper extremities, as well as the static enduranceof the muscles supporting the movement, are assessed by performing as many push-ups as possible in 60 s.Push-ups were started from the lowest face-down position.Each participant ’s hands were kept at shoulder-width and level.The ﬁngers were directed forward, and the legs were kept parallel and close to each other.During themovement, the arms were fully extended, and the torso wasstraightly tensed.In the second phase, the torso was lowered downto an elbow angle of 90 °.
The result of this test was expressed as the number of push-ups completed in 60 s [ACSM ’s Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription, 2000 ( ACSM, 2000 )]. The reliabilities for both the sit-up and the push-up tests have beenreported to be high (intraclass correlation values ranged from0.92 to 0.95) ( Ryman Augustsson et al., 2009 ).The results of the push-up, sit-up, and standing long jump tests were transformed into z-scores by standardizing them to be co-dimensional with each other.Then the mean of each z-scoreformed a common continuous variable, called muscular ﬁtness index (MFI), as reported previously ( Vaara et al., 2014 ).Leisure-time physical activity was studied from self- ﬁllable questionnaires.Participants responded to questions “How many times a week on average do you do endurance-type exercise?”and “How many times a week on average do you engage in exercise thatdevelops muscular strength (e.g., gym training)?
”(Think about the last 3 months) with eight response categories: 1 = none; 2 = once a week;3 = 2 times a week; 4 = 3 times a week; 5 = 4 times a week; 6 = 5 times aweek; 7 = 6 times a week; 8 = 7 times or more per week. In general,regarding physical activity questionnaires, acceptable to goodreliability but poor to moderate validity has been reported (Helmerhorst et al., 2012 ).2.5 Statistical analysis Bivariate Pearson ’s correlations (r) between serum 25(OH)D and physical performance, anabolic hormone levels, and controllingcovariates were performed to show the logical progression of statistical choices and to con ﬁrm the relevance of candidate covariates.Then linear regression was used to assess the associationof serum 25(OH)D levels with physical performance and anabolichormone after controlling for the group, BMI, and leisure-timephysical activity.
The size of the analyzed data in multivariable-adjusted analyses varied from n = 329 to n= 349 due to some missing data in variables of BMI and leisure-time physical activity(n= 24), and physical performance and anabolic hormones variables themselves (see Table 2 ). Additionally, the groups were analyzed separately by dividing them into subgroups using a suf ﬁcient level of serum 25(OH)D ≥75 nmol/L ( Holick, 2017 ) as a limit value.Differences in outcome variables between the subgroups wereanalyzed using independent samples t-tests.The results of thet-tests have been reported according to whether the equivalence ofthe variances has been assumed or not.Statistical analyses wereperformed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh, Version 27.0.Armonk, NY: IBM Corp (released 2020).A two-sided p-value under 0.05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant.Post-hoc power analyses were performed using G*Power version 3.1.9.6.
3 Results The mean serum 25(OH)D levels were signi ﬁcantly lower in group A (data gathered in January) than in group B (data gathered in July) (56.3 ± 14.5 nmol/L vs 78.3 ± 18.5 nmol/L, p<0.001). The mean serum 25(OH)D of the whole study population was 68 ± 20 nmol/L.The results of physical performance and anabolic hormones arepresented in Table 1 .In the whole population, serum 25(OH)D levels correlated statistically signi ﬁcantly with testosterone (r = −0.294) and IGF-1 (r = 0.231); p<0.001, n= 412 for both.When groups were analyzed separately, there were no statistically signi ﬁcant Pearson correlations (r) between serum 25(OH)D and physical performance or anabolichormones in winter group A.Instead, in summer group B, positiveweak correlations (all p<0.05) were found between 25(OH)D and push-ups (r = 0.208), sit-ups (r = 0.235), standing long jumps (r =0.257), 12-min running test (r = 0.288), MFI (r = 0.269), TES (r =0.157) and SHBG (r = 0.138).
After controlling the whole study population for the group, body composition, and leisure-time physical activity, 25(OH)D level was positively associated with push-up, sit-up, standing long jump, and 12-min running tests, and with MFI ( Table 2 ). Of controlling variables, BMI had a weak negative correlation with serum 25(OH)D (r = −0.140) and physical performance tests Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 03Laaksi et al.10.3389/fphys.2023.1049503 (sit-ups: r = −0.234, standing long jumps: r = −0.314, 12-min running test: r = −0.249 and MFI −0.249).Leisure-time physical activity did not correlate with serum 25(OH)D but had weakpositive correlations with all phys ical performance variables and TES (sit-ups: r = 0.259, push-ups: r = 0.282, standing long jumps:r = 0.172, 12-min running test: r = 0.165, MFI: r = 0.276 and TES:r = 0.120).
The differences between participants that had suf ﬁcient ( ≥75 nmol/L) and insuf ﬁcient ( <75 nmol/L) serum 25(OH)D levels were also tested with independent samples t-test ( Table 3 ). As the physical condition differed between groups A and B ( p<0.001), due to differences in military units, the groups were analyzed separately.In group B, the participantswith serum 25(OH)D level higher than the suf ﬁcient level, hadsigniﬁcantly better results in the 12-min run test ( p<0.001), sit-ups (p= 0.048), standing long jumps ( p= 0.010), and muscular ﬁtness index (0.031) and higher levels of TES (0.004), while in group A, there were onlysigniﬁcant differences in push-ups ( p= 0.022), respectively.Using effect sizes, derived from independent samples t-test, actual post hoc power showed to be at least 80%.

The participants in group A were conducting their military service in rapid deployment forces requiring betterphysical performance than group B, in which the participants werein standard military service. As group A was measured in winter whenthe vitamin D intake from the sunlight is lower, the association ofvitamin D would not have been visible if the groups had been analyzedtogether.Due to the compulsory military service in Finland, the participants in the present study represent the normal population of young men.Although most of the studies in this ﬁeld have been conducted on athletes, the results coincide with the present study, showing positiverelationships between serum 25(OH)D levels and muscular power andendurance ( Hamilton et al., 2014 ;Koundourakis et al., 2014 ; Hildebrand et al., 2016 ;Heileson et al., 2022 ).The mechanisms of how vitamin D affects muscular ﬁtness remain hypothetical, although there are several potential pathways.
Vitamin D is known to in ﬂuence both calcium and phosphate metabolism ( Charoenngam et al., 2019 ). Calcium has a fundamental role in muscle contraction ( Berchtold et al., 2000 ) and thus, vitamin D may have indirect bene ﬁcial effects on muscle contraction and strength viaits effects on systemic calcium levels ( Girgis et al., 2013 ).In the present study, serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with better results in tests requiring ef ﬁcient muscle actions (push-ups, sit-ups, standing long jump), indicating that itcould be enhanced by vitamin D.Also, vitamin D has been suggested to have direct effects on skeletal muscle through vitamin D receptor (VDR), which has been found in human skeletal muscle cells ( Pojednic and Ceglia, 2014 ).
VDR-mediated effects have been suggested to have rapid non-genomic and genomic effects on intracellular calcium andphosphate homeostasis, muscle differentiation, contractile proteinexpression/activity, and phospholipid composition ( Girgis et al., 2013 ). This is supported by abnormal skeletal muscle development and reduced strength in VDR-knockout mice ( Endo et al., 2003 ;Girgis et al., 2015 ).This could be associated with better progress in training muscular ﬁtness for those with suf ﬁcient vitamin D levels.The Global Endocrine Society ’s Practice Guidelines Committee ’s recommendation for 25(OH)D level for maximum musculoskeletalhealth is ≥75 nmol/L ( Holick, 2017 ).Interestingly, in group B, participants above that level had better outcomes in almost all variables in physical performance and higher TES.In group A,parallel results were found but only push-ups were statisticallysigniﬁcant.
The present study also showed a positive relationship between serum 25(OH)D and aerobic performance. Associations betweenserum 25(OH)D and aerobic performance have previously beenshown in several studies ( Forney et al., 2014 ;Carswell et al., 2018 ; Zeitler et al., 2018 ).Notably, in line with the present study ( Carswell et al., 2018 ), found in military recruits that serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with aerobic performance, although they reported a non-signiﬁcant association with muscular strength and power.The association between serum 25(OH)D levels and VO 2max could relate to VDRs as well.VDRs have also been found in cardiacmuscle cells ( Reddy Vanga et al., 2010 ), indicating that vitamin D may also have bene ﬁcial effects on aerobic performance by in ﬂuencing oxygen transportation and utilization ( Dahlquist et al., 2015 ).
In addition to the direct effects of vitamin D through VDR and the indirect effect on calcium homeostasis, vitamin D may have abeneﬁcial impact on physical performance by increasing the levels of TES in the blood ( Wehr et al., 2010 ;Nimptsch et al., 2012 ;Anic et al., 2016 ). VDRs have also been found in areas of the male reproductive tract such as the Leydig cells ( Jensen, 2014 ).Testosterone is known to induce increased muscle growth, i.e., hypertrophy, by multiple mechanisms which include increasing the size and number of muscle ﬁbers, increasing the number of myonuclei, and increasing the number of muscle satellite cells.

10.3389/fphys.2023.1049503 that higher vitamin D levels may indirectly improve muscular strength and thus physical performance. In the present study, TES was foundhigher in participants with suf ﬁcient ( ≥75 nmol/L) serum 25(OH)D levels in group B.Most of the circulating TES is bound to albumin andSHBG and higher SHBG levels indicates lower bioavailable TES levelsand thus alter the effects of TES in the human body ( Goldman et al., 2017 ).Nevertheless, there were no signi ﬁcant results on the SHBG levels in the present study (only a weak positive correlation in group B,which disappeared after adjusting for covariates).IGF-1, on the otherhand, is a hormone that, among numerous other effects, regulatesanabolic and catabolic pathways in skeletal muscle ( Yoshida and Delafontaine, 2020 ).
Vitamin D has been shown to increase serum IGF-1 levels through the induction of transcription of several genes inthe liver ( Ameri et al., 2013b ) IGF-1 is also associated with better physical performance outcomes in some studies ( Cappola et al., 2001 ; Nindl et al., 2011 ). A systematic review and meta-analysis showed a signiﬁcant increase in IGF-1 levels in participants supplemented daily with ≤25ug of vitamin D.In the present study, there was a weak positive correlation between IGF-1 and serum 25(OH)D levels, but theeffect disappeared after adjusting for seasonally presentative groupeffect.The present study had several strengths.Muscular ﬁtness was measured with three different muscle ﬁtness tests: push-up, sit-up, and standing long jump which gives a comprehensive image of the muscularﬁtness state of the participants.Importantly, regression models were also controlled with BMI.
High fat mass leads to decreased serum 25(OH)D levels ( Wortsman et al., 2000 ) and impairs physical performance ( Mattila et al., 2007 ) and hence is a major confoundi ng factor. Another strength of the present study is the assessment of anabolic hormones TES and IGF-1.In addition, it is important to explore the seasonal variation of serum25(OH)D levels, especially, i n high-latitude countries such as Finland, where adequate sunlight exp o s u r ee x i s t so n l yi nas h o r tp e r i o d of summer months ( Engelsen et al., 2005 ).Still, the study has some limitations.In group A, there were on ly 18 participants who reached over the suf ﬁcient serum 25(OH)D level of 75 nmol/L which may explain the lack of statistically signi ﬁcant differences between the suf ﬁcient and insufﬁcient participants.The participants in group B had higher serum 25(OH)D levels and thus more statistical power in the suf ﬁcient group.
The greatest limitation of the present study is that it is a cross-sectional study and therefore causal conclusion ca nnot be made. It is possible that the associations between serum 25(OH)D levels and physical performancecould be partly explained by reverse causation: the more physically activeparticipants may spend more time ou tdoors exposed to sunlight, hence have a better physical condition as we ll as higher serum 25(OH)D levels.In conclusion, the hypotheses were supported, and the present study shows that serum 25(OH)D level could be positively associated with aerobic and muscular ﬁtness.It is also possible that vitamin D is associated with physical performance only at a suf ﬁcient level of serum 25(OH)D, and the effects may be mediated or moderated throughincreasing the serum levels of testosterone.Further randomizedcontrol trial (RCT) research is needed in which the serum level of25(OH)D must reach the suf ﬁcient limit for the supplementation group.
This could be conducted in Finland during wintertime as wenoticed that only a minor share of young Finnish men reaches the recommended 25(OH)D threshold in winter.Data availability statement The raw data supporting the conclusion of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.
