Association of vitamin D deficiency with post-exercise hypotension and arterial stiffness following prolonged endurance exercise in healthy young men Liang-You Chen a,b, Chun-Wei Wanga, Lu-An Chena and Cheng-Shiun He a,b aNational Chung Cheng University, Department of Athletic Sports, Chiayi, Taiwan; bNational Chung Cheng University, Graduate Institute of Education, Chiayi, Taiwan ABSTRACT Background: Vitamin D is associated with vascular function; how - ever, the impact of different vitamin D levels on vascular elasticity following prolonged exercise remains uncertain.The primary objec - tive of this study was to investigate the association of vitamin D levels with changes in peripheral pulse wave velocity (pPWV) and the magnitude of acute post-exercise hypotension (PEH) fol- lowing prolonged endurance exercise in healthy young men.
Methods: All the participants were divided into two groups: the 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) sufficiency group (25(OH)D ≧50 nmol/L) and the deficiency group (25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L). A cardiopulmonary exercise test for maximal oxygen uptake (V:O2max ) was performed on the graded cycling.The prolonged exercise was set at 60% V:O2max for 120 min of continuous riding on a stationary bicycle.The pPWV and blood pressure were measured at baseline and 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 min after prolonged endurance exercise.Results: Post hoc analysis revealed that the vitamin D sufficient group had a greater magnitude of PEH than the deficiency group at post-45 min.Multiple linear regression analyses showed a significant correlation between 25(OH)D and both pPWV (p = 0.036) and PEH (p = 0.007), after adjusting for V: O2max , weight, height, and physical activity.
In addition, the 25(OH)D deficiency group also had higher pPWV at post- 15 min (5.41 ± 0.93 vs 4.84 ± 0.75 m/s), post-30 min (5.30 ± 0.77 vs 4.87 ± 0.50 m/s), post-45 min (5.56 ± 0.93 vs 5.05 ± 0.68 m/s) than the sufficiency group. Conclusions: There was a positive correlation between 25(OH)D levels and systolic PEH following prolonged endurance exercise.Individuals with sufficient 25(OH)D status may have better vascular elasticity and more efficient blood pressure regulation during exercise.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 30 May 2023 Accepted 20 September 2024 KEYWORDS Post-exercise hypotension; vascular function; 25(OH)D; aerobic exercise; vascular elasticity CONTACT Cheng-Shiun He cshe@ccu.edu.tw National Chung Cheng University, Department of Athletic Sports, No.168, Sec.1, University Rd., Minhsiung, Chiayi 621301, Taiwan (R.O.C.)JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION 2024, VOL.21, NO.1, 2410426 https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2024.2410426 © 2024 The Author(s).

In terms of vascular function, the presence of vitamin D receptors in vascular endothelial cells is thought to be the reason that vitamin D affects vascular physiology [6,7]. Furthermore, there is scientific evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, and enabling plaque formation in blood vessels and atherogenesis [8,9].In addition, the peripheral pulse wave velocity (pPWV) is the index of arterial stiffness, which is the major risk factor for CVD [10].A higher pPWV indicates lower vascular compliance and assignability, corresponding to increased arterial stiffness [11].Moreover, a high pPWV has been significantly associated with an increased risk of CVD [10].Exercise can elicit acute alterations in arterial stiffness and may reveal vascular abnorm - alities that are not observed at rest [12–15 ].
Previous studies have provided evidence that artery stiffness transiently decreased after prolonged endurance exercise and gradually returns toward baseline [13,14]. This reduction is largely evoked by vascular dilation and the post-exercise drop in blood pressure [13,14].Earlier investigations have widely reported that after a single session of prolonged exercise, there is a blood pressure lowering effect.This phenomenon is referred to as post-exercise hypotension (PEH) [14,16,17].PEH mainly takes place within 60 min of recovery after prolonged exercise [17].PEH has been shown to produce beneficial effects on controlling hypertension and reducing the risk of CVD [6,7].The magnitude of PEH varies depending on the physical health of participants.Therefore, stimulating blood vessels during exercise to achieve higher levels of PEH is an important strategy for managing blood pressure [18].
Vitamin D regulates blood pressure by acting on the endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells [4,19] and may be an important factor to improve vascular function and consequently exercise efficiency. However, the magnitude of PEH in individuals with different vitamin D levels after prolonged exercise is still unclear.Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to determine the acute post-exercise effects of vitamin D status on pPWV and PEH.In addition, the study aimed to investigate the relationships among vitamin D concentrations, pPWV, and PEH following prolonged endurance exercise in healthy young men.It was hypothesized that vitamin D sufficiency could elicit greater PEH effect and pPWV responses.2.Methods 2.1.Participants A priori power analysis was calculated using G*Power (ver.3.1.9.7, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany).Based on the previous literature, we set a predefined power of 0.80, an effect size of 0.82, and an alpha level of 0.05 [14,20].
This requires at least 15 participants for each group to detect significant 2 L.-Y. CHEN ET AL.differences in PWV [14].Additionally, a total of at least 31 participants are needed for the linear regression analysis [20].Between October and December, a total of 50 male participants between the ages of 19 and 24 was recruited from a university in Taiwan (23.5°N).On average, the participants reported engaging in physical activity for 8.79 ± 4.74 h per week.In this study, 56% of the participants had sufficient vitamin D, while 44% of the participants had a deficiency in vitamin D during the winter.Previous investigations have revealed that 47 ~ 69% of the Asia population in East Asia has vitamin D deficiency [21,22].Participants filled out the health and physical activity questionnaire and provided informed consent before participating in this study.Three months prior to participating, they were instructed not to take any dietary supplements.
All participants had a clear understanding of experimental procedures. This study was approved by the ethical advisory committee at National Chung Cheng University (no: CCUREC109040701).The exclusion criteria included a self-reported history of major illnesses such as pulmonary disease, neurological cardiac disease, or CVD.Participants who smoked, consumed excessive alcohol, had a caffeine addiction, were overweight, or regularly took medications such as NSAIDs or antidepressants were excluded from the experiment.In addition, the participants must meet the requirements for regular physical activity (at least a total of 3-h moderate or high-intensity exercise per week).This study did not recruit female participants due to the potential influence of hormonal changes during the men - strual cycle on pPWV measurement [15,23].2.2.
Procedures This research was of direct relevance to our previous study, which determined the relationship between vitamin D levels and pPWV following acute maximal exercise [15]. The same protocols and experimental methods were used and adopted in this planned follow-on study [15].All the participants voluntarily participated in this experiment and arrived at the laboratory in the morning [10:]00- [13:]00) following an overnight fast.The health and physical activity questionnaire and informed consent form were filled out by the participants.Afterwards, blood was drawn from their forearm veins in a sitting position.The 6 ml of blood were collected into a vacutainer tube (EDTA, Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK).The EDTA blood was centri - fuged for 10 min at 1500 g and 4°C and the plasma was transferred to a −20°C for storage.After the blood is drawn, the participants rested for a day to prevent tem - porary symptoms of anemia and dizziness without affecting exercise performance [15].
Each participant then conducted a cycling maximum graded exercise trial. Forty-eight hours after the maximum exercise, the session of prolonged exercise was performed for 120 min.The pPWV and blood pressure were measured at baseline and at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after prolonged exercise [15].2.3.Measurements 2.3.1.Maximal graded exercise The participants performed a maximal graded exercise trial on a stationary bicycle (UB5 Upright Bike, Greenmaster Industrial Corp., Taichung, Taiwan) to determine their maximal JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION 3 oxygen consumption (V:O2max) (Metalyzer 3B, Cortex Biophysik GmbH, Sachsen, Germany).The protocol includes a 2-min cycling warm-up with no resistance.The participants were required to maintain a cycling speed of at least 60 revolutions per minute (rpm) during cycling.The maximal graded exercise began at a workload of 50 watts; the participants increased the workload by 30 watts every 2 min until exhaustion [24].2.4.
Prolonged endurance exercise Prolonged exercise session was performed on a stationary bicycle, and the protocols were adapted from a previous study [25]. The intensity of exercise was based on V:O2max, which was established by the maximal exercise trial data.The participants cycled for 120 min at an intensity corresponding to 60% V:O2max, and the rotation speed was maintained at 60 rpm [25,26].This speed allowed the participants to maintain a sustainable intensity throughout the cycling [25,26].To ensure consistent physical hydration status, the parti - cipants were allowed to consume plain water with no calorie ad libitum during the exercise.2.5.Blood pressure For the baseline blood pressure measurement, the participants rested for 5 min in a controlled room (25 ± 1°C).The brachial blood pressure measurements (MEN-1000; Omron Healthy Corp., Taipei, Taiwan) were performed twice on their right arm in a sitting position by a trained research assistant.
The average of the two measurements was used for statistical analysis, rounded to the second decimal place [27]. 2.6.The pPWV The pPWV was analyzed by MP150 data acquisition and analysis systems (Biopac Systems Inc., CA, USA).Infrared sensors recorded pulse waves simultaneously using photoplethys - mogram (PPG) for 150 sec.The pPWV was calculated as the transit time of the pulse wave over the length of the peripheral path (finger-to-toe) of each participant.The analysis systems automatically calculated the average pPWV values (m/s) after the distance difference was entered [15,23].2.7.Plasma analysis The plasma samples were analyzed as the sum of 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D 2 in this study.The resting plasma samples were assayed in duplicates for a concentration of 25(OH)D using a commercially available 25-hydroxy Vitamin DS EIA enzyme immunoassay (Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd., Bolton, UK) [28].This EIA is standardization certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [29].
The intra-assay CV was <5% across a working range of 0 to 260 nmol/L. Altieri et al.[30] indicated that the mean bias between 25-hydroxy Vitamin DS EIA and LC-MS/MS is <3%.4 L.-Y.CHEN ET AL.2.8.Statistical analysis The data were used for Shapiro–Wilk analysis to test the normal distribution.An inde - pendent sample t-test was used to evaluate baseline characteristics between the groups.A two-way (time vs group) repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test differences in pPWV and blood pressure.Post hoc analyses were conducted using LSD to follow up on statistically significant interaction or main effects.The bivariate correla - tions between vitamin D status and PEH or pPWV were performed by Pearson product- moment analysis.Further analysis was conducted to explore the association between the pPWV and 25(OH) D levels, and PEH and 25(OH)D levels, using hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis.
The variance inflation factor was used to test models adjusted for potential confounding factors, including V:O2max , weight, height, and physical activity. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (Ver.22.0, IBM Inc., NY, USA).Descriptive data variables were presented as mean ± SD.The statistical significance level was p < 0.05.3.Results 3.1.Plasma total 25(OH)D concentrations and baseline characteristics The total 25(OH)D concentration from the 28 participants classified in the sufficiency group (≧50 nmol/L) was 60.21 ± 6.75 nmol/L, while the total 25(OH)D concentration of the 22 participants classified in the deficiency group (<50 nmol/L) was 40.68 ± 7.50 nmol/L.There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the sufficiency and deficiency vitamin D groups (Table 1).3.2.Blood pressure following prolonged endurance exercise The results showed a significant effect for time (p = 0.000) and interaction (p = 0.007) on SBP.
The vitamin D deficient group showed a significant increase in SBP at post-0 minute compared to baseline values, while SBP also significantly decreased at post-45 minute and post-60 minute. In contrast, the vitamin D sufficient group showed significant reductions in SBP at post-15 minute, post-30 minute, post-45 minute, and post-60 minute compared with baseline values.The sufficient group showed lower SBP at post-30 minute compared with the deficient group.DBP showed no significant time effect (p = 0.744), group effect (p = 0.460), and interaction effect (p = 0.632) (Table 2).The peak magnitude of PEH was Table 1.Participant characteristics.Variable Sufficiency Deficiency Age (years old) 20.96 ± 1.78 21.36 ± 2.12 BMI (kg/m2) 23.17 ± 2.61 22.97 ± 2.92 Rest-pPWV (m/s) 5.26 ± 0.72 5.75 ± 1.18 Vitamin D (nmol/L) 60.21 ± 6.75* 40.68 ± 7.5 V:O2max (mL/kg/min) 43.97 ± 5.69 40.78 ± 7.17 Activity (hours/week) 8.90 ± 4.52 8.68 ± 5.25 Data are shown as mean ± SD.

The Vitamin D sufficient group had significantly larger PEH than the deficient group.There were significant positive correlations between 25(OH)D levels and PEH.After adjusting for V:O2max , weight, height, and physical activity, plasma 25(OH)D explained the 23% of the variance in the pPWV and 25% in PEH.In addition, the 25(OH)D deficient group had a higher pPWV at post-15 minute, post-30 minute, and post-45 minute than the sufficiency group.Individuals with sufficient 25(OH)D had a better vascular elasticity and blood pressure regulation following prolonged exercise.4.1.
Vitamin D sufficiency have better blood pressure regulation The results of this study show that vitamin D sufficiency elicits a larger PEH effect and a higher pPWV response. Previous research has demonstrated that 25(OH)D can stimulate a vasoprotective effect [9,31].In this study, the post-exercise SBP significantly increased in the vitamin D deficient group, whereas it did not show a significant increase in the 25(OH)D sufficient group after prolonged exercise.The exaggerated SBP response may increase arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction [32,33].From this study, the vitamin D sufficient group did not show a significant spike in SBP after exercise.This could be inferred that individuals with sufficient vitamin D levels may possess a more efficient blood pressure regulation system [17,18,27].Additionally, the study showed a positive correlation between PEH and vitamin D.
The vitamin D sufficiency group had a significantly greater magnitude of PEH after exercise compared to the deficiency group. The likely explanation for this difference is the positive relationship between vitamin D levels and vasodilation.It is well known that vasodilation is associated with the regulation of NO [34–37 ].However, a molecular mechanism of prolonged exercise induced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability at different vitamin D levels remains unclear.Wee et al.(2021) indicated that vitamin D moderated NO synthesis by mediating the activity of the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) [34,35].Therefore, we speculate that vitamin D deficiency may potentially impair NO produc - tion in endothelial cells, resulting in reduced NO bioavailability and potential endothe - lial dysfunction risk [34,35].4.2.Correlations between vitamin D levels with PEH and pPWV Many studies have demonstrated that 25(OH)D is linked to hypertension, arterial stiffness, and CVD [2,8,9,15].
Our results reveal that the plasma 25(OH)D status was negatively associated with pPWV at post-exercise 15 min, post-exercise 30 min, and post-exercise 45 min. Furthermore, multiple linear regression analysis showed that 25 (OH)D explained 23% and 25% of the variance in pPWV and PEH, respectively, after adjusting for V:O2max , weight, height, and amount of physical activity.The changes of pPWV after prolonged endurance exercise might be affected by blood pressure response [14].The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in blood pressure regulation.The clinical study has shown the impact of vitamin 10 L.-Y.CHEN ET AL.D on RAAS activity [38].In this study, sufficient vitamin D was linked to better vascular function after exercise.We propose that vitamin D could improve blood pressure regulation via the RAAS.Dawson et al.
[39] indicated that femoral flow mediated dilation (FMD), an index of vasomotor function, was significantly reduced after pro- longed endurance exercise for non-elite runners. This causes a period of depressed cardiovascular function, which may lead to the risk of elevated cardiac risk [14].In our experiment, it was found that the vitamin D deficient group showed no significant change in pPWV after exercise.In contrast, the vitamin D sufficient group showed significant decreases in pPWV at post-exercise 0, 15, and 30 min.Therefore, individuals with vitamin D deficiency had poorer vascular elasticity and dilation response follow - ing exercise, which could increase the risk of endothelial dysfunction and potential cardiovascular events [14,39].4.3.The pPWV following prolonged endurance exercise Our observation of a significant reduction in pPWV in the vitamin D sufficient group after exercise aligns with the findings of previous studies [14,40].
These studies indicated that exercise can trigger acute changes in vascular response that are not apparent before exercise [15]. It should be noted that exercise increases muscle blood flow and shear rate in the lower limbs, contributing to the release of NO.Shear stress-induced release of NO, the endothelial-derived vasodilator, may play a role in the exercise response to blood flow [36,41].Kim et al.[9] indicated that vitamin D has a vascular vasoprotective effect, while vitamin D deficiency mainly reduces the bioavailability of endothelium-dependent vasodilators and NO.The regulation of NO in blood vessels may also be associated with ultraviolet A (UVA) [37].UVA is a type of ultraviolet light emitted by the sun.It ranges from approximately 320 to 400 nanometers [37].Liu et al.[37] demonstrated that exposure of human skin to UVA radiation results in vasodilation of the arterial vasculature and lowers blood pressure in a manner independent of NO synthase.
The results of our study found that adults with 25(OH)D sufficiency showed a significant decrease in pPWV after prolonged endurance exercise. However, there were no significant changes observed in individuals with 25(OH)D deficiency, which may be affected by peripheral vascular vasodilation and flexibility.Therefore, the participants with sufficient vitamin D had a better vascular elasticity during endurance exercise.4.4.The relationship between vitamin D levels and prolonged exercise capacity There was a positive association between 25(OH)D status and endurance exercise performance [3,4].Carswell et al.[42] indicated that every 1 nmol/L increase in 25 (OH)D levels, resulted in accelerated running times by 0.42 ± 0.16 s faster for 1.5 mile in men.However, in this study, we did not find significant differences in V:O2max between the groups.The impact of vitamin D may be observable in other endurance indexes [3,4,42].Poole et al.
[43] illustrated that a 5% increase in vessel radius could lead to a 20% increase in overall blood flow. Thus, reduced vasodilation or increased arterial stiffness may greatly diminish blood flow.In this study, we found a positive JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION 11 correlation between vitamin D levels and systolic PEH after prolonged exercise.In addition, the vitamin D sufficient group had better vascular elasticity.Preventing low 25(OH)D levels and achieving vitamin D sufficiency could be important for both endurance and strength exercise.Vitamin D may promote skeletal muscle protein synthesis through vitamin D receptor-mediated signaling, which could also enhance cardiac and endothelial functions [44].Therefore, our results suggest that individuals with sufficient vitamin D levels may exhibit better vasodilation and vascular regulation, providing the necessary oxygen during prolonged exercise.
Based on the results of our previous study [15] and this study, we found that individuals with sufficient 25(OH)D levels demonstrated better vascular elasticity following acute maximal exercise and prolonged exercise. We recommend that people engaging in anaerobic exercise or prolonged exercise need to be mindful of their vitamin D levels to reduce the risk of potential vascular events and endothelial dysfunction.5.Limitations This study has limitations, as we did not assess hydration status, levels of inflammation, or angiotensin in our participants, which could be potential factors affecting vascular func - tion.Further investigation is needed to explore these potential mechanisms.We did not investigate 24-h dietary recall, which could affect vascular elasticity (i.e.potassium, magnesium, omega-3, omega-6, and fatty acids).However, participants were instructed to maintain consistent nutritional intake and adhere to a regular lifestyle as much as possible.
As this study recruited only Asian individuals, it limits the generalizability of the findings to other ethnicities. Additionally, the study did not control for confounding variables, such as diet and sunlight exposure, which could affect vitamin D levels and vascular function.Therefore, future studies should take into account these variables to better understand the association between vitamin D and vascular function.Moreover, there is currently insufficient evidence regarding vitamin D concentrations across the menstrual cycle in women.Future studies could consider controlling for different phases of the menstrual cycle and explore the relationship between vitamin D fluctuations, PEH, and arterial stiffness.We also recommend potentially assessing the proposed mechanism of vitamin D and its correlation with PEH based on cardiac output and stroke volume.
6.Conclusion In our study, there was a significant positive correlation between 25(OH)D levels and systolic PEH; therefore, we suggest that individuals with sufficient 25(OH)D levels have better vascular elasticity and more efficient blood pressure regulation after prolonged endurance exercise. Furthermore, Vitamin D deficiency may lead to endothelial dysfunc - tion and increase the risk of cardiovascular events following endurance exercise in active and healthy young men.Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).12 L.-Y.CHEN ET AL.Funding This study was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST107-2410-H-194- 094].ORCID Liang-You Chen http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7720-6515 Cheng-Shiun He http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8766-5926 Author contributions All authors contributed to data collection, recruitment, and communication with participants.
