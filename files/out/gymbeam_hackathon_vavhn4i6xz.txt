46 46Pegaspargase is a chemotherapy drug used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).One of the adverse effects of pegaspargase is hepatotoxicity, which can rapidly lead to liver failure and death.We report a patient with ALL who developed pegaspargase-induced severe hepatotoxicity that was rescued by treatment with vitamin B complex and L-carnitine.Our patient had a quicker response than prior reported cases, suggesting this treatment might be a better regimen.Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in young adults is frequently treated with pediatric-inspired multiagent chemotherapy.Some of these treatments include aspara-ginase as an integral part of the regimen.Asparaginase has a signiﬁ cant adverse eﬀ ect proﬁ le, including risk of throm- bosis, bleeding, pancreatic hypersensitivity, and hepatotoxicity.Asparaginase toxicity on the liver can be quite severe and may produce a rapid functional decline and even lead to death (1).
Typical therapy for this adverse event is supportive care. We report a patient with ALL who developed pegaspargase-induced severe hepatotoxicity that dramatically recovered after treatment with a regimen of vitamin B complex and L-carnitine.CASE REPORT A 23-year-old man with precursor B-cell ALL was treated with an induction chemotherapy regimen of augmented Ber- lin-Frankfurt-Münster.Th is pediatric regimen includes weekly doxorubicin at 25 mg/m 2, weekly vincristine at 2 mg for three doses, one dose of pegaspargase at 2500 unit/m2 (intravenous, on day 4), and prednisone at 60 mg twice daily for 1 month.Th e patient also received prednisone and palonosetron.On day 8, his total bilirubin level started to increase from a baseline of 0.8 mg/dL, gradually reaching 13.5 mg/dL on day 22.Over the same time period, his international normalized ratio also in-creased from 1.1 to 1.9.
Subsequently, his alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase rose to 495 U/L, 150 U/L, and 416 U/L, respectively, on days 27 to 29. He did not develop encephalopathy or ascites.He had no his-tory of smoking, drinking alcohol, or using recreational drugs.His body mass index and his fasting cholesterol level were within normal limits.T esting for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeﬁ ciency virus, Epstein-Barr From the Department of Hematology/Oncology, Division of Internal Medicine, Baylor Scott & White Health, Temple, Texas.Corresponding author: Gary Lu, MD, PhD, Baylor Scott & White Health, 2401 South 31st Street, Temple, TX 76508 (e-mail: galu@sw.org).virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, mononucleosis screen, and bacterial infections was negative.Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler revealed no venoocclusive disease.

L-carnitine and vitamin B com-plex are mitochondrial cofactors.By supplementing these cofac-tors, the mitochondrial toxicities can be corrected (5, 6).Only one case report describes how aspar-aginase-related liver dysfunction can be managed by a combina-tion of L-carnitine and vitamin B complex (6).Overall, we believe that the vitamin B complex and levocarnitine regimen may be an eﬀ ective and safe therapy for pegaspargase-induced hepatotoxicity.1.Bodmer M, Sulz M, Stadlmann S, Droll A, T erracciano L, Krähenbühl S.Fatal liver failure in an adult patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia following treatment with L-asparaginase.Digestion 2006;74(1):28–32.2.Pui CH, Evans WE.T reatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.N Engl J Med 2006;354(2):166–178.3.Whitecar JP Jr, Bodey GP , Harris JE, Freireich EJ.L-asparaginase.

Within 1 week, his total bilirubin level was 4.6 mg/dL, and it normalized on day 40.Simultaneously, his transaminase and prothrombin time also normalized, as shown in Figure 1.A CT scan 2 months later showed a resolution of fatty liver (Figure 2).DISCUSSION Asparaginase, a major drug component in the therapy for ALL, depletes the circulating asparagine pool, thereby inhibit- ing protein synthesis and producing apoptosis (2).Adminis-tration of asparaginase in all dosages has been associated with disturbance of hepatic function and lipid metabolism (3).An asparaginase dosing strategy based on its pharmacokinetic char-acteristics in adults has been reported (4), but 20% of patients with this regimen have to discontinue their treatment due to severe hepatic toxicities.
L-carnitine and vitamin B complex have been used in the treatment of nucleoside reverse transcrip-tase inhibitor–induced mitochondrial toxicities with success (5).
