The nega - tive control (NC) contained no antifungal additive and the positive control had potassium sorbate (0.1% w/w). Treats were baked into 3cm x 3cm squares.Individual squares were inoculated with 0.1 mL of Aspergillus flavus (ATCC 204304) to achieve a final concentra - tion of ~ 5.0 Log CFU/square.The inoculated squares were individually incubated at 250 C.Fungal analysis was performed at day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 and 28 by surface plating on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) followed by incubation at 250 C for 72h.The total log reductions were calculated by subtracting the initial inoculum with the colony counts on day 28.Log re - ductions of Aspergillus flavus (P< 0.05) were observed when WPF at 0.25% and 0.5% were added with 0.15% CX compared with when 0.015% CX was applied.All treatments were different from the NC (P< 0.05).Citrus extract at 0.15% potentiated the antifungal potency of WPF at 0.5% to give a similar log reduction (P >0.05) to WPF at 1.0% the treats.
In conclusion, CX reduced the dose of WPF required to control Aspergillus flavus in semi-moist dog treats.

Cats were fed a semi-synthetic diet sufficient in Met for 2 weeks prior to being randomly allocated to one of the eight dietary Met treatments (0.12%, 0.17%, 0.21%, 0.28%, 0.35%, 0.42%, 0.50% and 0.57% dry-matter). Cys was provided in excess to spare the Met requirement and meet the Cys requirement.After 2d of adaptation, individual IAAO studies were performed.During each IAAO study day, cats were placed in indirect calorimetry chambers and fed 75% of their daily ration (12.38g/kg BW) split in 13 ½-hourly small meals.A priming dose of NaH13CO3 (0.44mg/kg) and L-[1-13C]-Phe (4.8mg/kg) were pro - vided in the 4th and 5th meal, respectively, following by a constant dose (1.04mg/kg) of L-[1-13C]-Phe in the next meals.Breath samples were collected ½-hourly to measure 13CO2 enrichment to quantify 13CO2 and calculate F13CO2 during isotopic steady state (Phe oxi - dation).
Competing models, broken-line linear (BLL) ascending model, and a broken-line quadratic (BLQ) ascending model, were fitted on F13CO2 to determine the minimum requirement of Met (breakpoint). The BLL yielded the best model with mean minimum Met requirement estimated at 0.305% (dry-matter), and the 95% confidence interval estimated at 0.521% (dry- matter) for adult cats.In conclusion, the estimated min Met requirement in this study is greater than those currently recommended by the NRC (2006; 0.17% dry- matter) and AAFCO (0.2% dry-matter).Keywords: requirement, stable isotopes, sulfur amino acids
