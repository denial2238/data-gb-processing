Introduction Postpartum depression (PPD) is one of the most common postpartum psychiatric disorders.[1]It is a combination of depressed mood, loss of interest, anhedonia, impaired concen-tration, feelings of guilt, or worthlessness and suicidal thoughts.[2]Some patients often have thoughts of harming theirchild.[3]The prevalence of PPD ranges from approximately 10% to 30%.[4,5]The best predictors for PPD are the psychiatric history and adverse life events.[6]Poor social support, persistent infant health problems, marital dif ﬁculties and violence are the common psychosocial risk factors.[7–10]Besides, rapid changes in estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy, genetics, and immune function have been implicated in the pathophysiology ofPPD.
[11–13]Psychological interventions such as cognitive behav- ioral therapy, interpersonal therapy and dynamic therapy have been speci ﬁcally adapted for mild to moderate PPD.[14–16]When PPD is severe or not suf ﬁciently responsive to psychological treatment, pharmacological interventions may be necessary. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as the ﬁrst-line antide- pressant medications for PPD have been showed higher remissionrates compared to placebo.
[17]Electroconvulsive therapy is considered to treat severe PPD, especially in the setting of intractable suicidality.[18] In recent years, iron supplementation has emerged as potential means to treat PPD because many studies have documented the association of iron de ﬁciency anemia and low ferritin with PPD.[19,20]Iron de ﬁciency can change concentrations of cyto- chrome C, dopamine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric, and have numerous adverse effects on brain function.[21]One study showed that as iron stores decreased, risk of developing PPD increased, and many PPD patients had depleted iron stores.[22] Sheikh et al found a positive association between early ironThis work was supported by the Medical Research Project of Chongqing Health and Family Planning Commission combined with Chongqing Science andTechnology Commission (NO. 2019MSXMl01).The authors have no con ﬂicts of interest to disclose.

[23] Up to now, no systematic review or meta-analysis has been performed on the effectiveness of iron supplementation for PPD.Therefore, we will conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for iron supplementation treatment of PPD.2.Methods 2.1.Study registration This study has been registered on INPLASY (INPLASY202011000 7).It will be performed following Pre- ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.[24] 2.2.Eligibility criteria for study selection 2.2.1.Types of studies.All RCTs of iron supplementation for PPD will be included without language limitation.
Case reports,animal experiments, and reviews will be excluded. 2.2.2.Types of participants.Participants who meet the diagnostic criteria of PPD will be included without restrictions of nationality, age, gender, and race.2.2.3.Types of interventions.In the treatment group, patients were given iron supplementation with no limitations ofadministration routes, dosage, or duration of intervention.RCTs that have control groups with conventional treatments (such as psychological interventions and pharmacologicalinterventions) or no treatment will be included.2.2.4.Types of outcomes.Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score will be designated as the primary outcome.Improvement rate will be designated as the secondary outcome.2.3.
Search strategy PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science, and Tech- nology Journal Database and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database will be searched from their inception of databases toDecember 31, 2020. The detailed search strategy for PubMed isshown in Table 1.The similar search strategies will be used for other electronic databases.2.4.Selection of studies The searched literature will be imported into Endnote X9 (Thomson Reuters).The duplicates will be excluded by EndnoteX9.Two reviewers will independently scan titles and abstracts to eliminate all irrelevant records.After reading the full text of the remaining records, the ﬁnal included studies will be determined.Any disagreement about the selection of studies will be resolved by discussion with the third reviewer.A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ﬂow diagram will be designed to describe the details of selection process.2.5.
Data extraction and management Two reviewers will extract data from the selected studies independently. The following information will be extracted: ﬁrstauthor ’s name, publication year, journal, study design, patient information, experimental intervention, control intervention,duration of follow-up, and outcomes.Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion with the third reviewer.If some important information is missing, we will contact original authors by emailto request detailed information about the research.2.6.Assessment of risk of bias The Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool will be used to assess the risk of bias.Random sequence generation, allocation conceal-ment, blinding of participants, and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome dat a, selective reporting, and other bias will be assessed by 2 reviews independently.A bias value of“high ”,“unclear ”,o r “low”will be given for each domain.
The rating results will be cross-checke d and the difference will be solved by the third reviewer. Bias graph and graphic summary of risk of bias will be provided in the completed review.2.7.Data synthesis and analysis 2.7.1.Data synthesis.We will perform data synthesis using Review Manager 5.3 software (The Cochrane Collaboration, Software Update, Oxford, UK).Risk ratio with 95% con ﬁdence interval will be used for dichotomous variables.Mean difference with 95% con ﬁdence interval will be used for continuous variables.Heterogeneity will be examined using the I 2test.The I2 value>50% means signi ﬁcant heterogeneity, and the random effects model will be used.Otherwise, the I2value/C2050% means minor heterogeneity, and the ﬁxed effects model will be utilized.2.7.2.Subgroup analysis.Subgroup analysis will be performed to explore the potential heterogeneity and inconsistency based ondifferences in participant characteristics, administration routes, dosage, and duration of intervention.
2.7.3. Sensitivity analysis.To check the robustness and reliability of data analysis, sensitivity analysis will be applied.Table 1 Search strategy for PubMed.Number Search terms 1 postpartum depression 2 PPD 3 postnatal depression4 post-partum 5 post-natal 6 depression7O r 1 –6 8 iron 9 intravenous iron infusion 10 oral iron11 iron supplementation12 Or 8 –11 13 randomized controlled trial 14 clinical trial15 trial 16 random 17 RCT18 placebo19 Or 13 –18 20 7 and 12 and 19 PPD=postpartum depression, RCT =randomized controlled trial.Tian et al.Medicine (2020) 99:50 Medicine 2 We will perform meta-analysis repeatedly after eliminating studies in low quality.2.7.4.Reporting bias.If≥10 trials are included, publication bias will be assessed with funnel plot and Egger regression analysis.[25,26] 2.8.Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not necessary because this study is based on literature analysis.The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.3.
Discussion This is the ﬁrst systematic review and meta-analysis to conduct a comprehensive literature search and provide a systematicsynthesis of current published data to explore the effectiveness of iron supplementation for PPD. Seven electronic literature databases will be searched to avoid missing any potential eligiblestudies.We will apply rigorous methodology to examine studies reporting iron supplementation for PPD.We believe that this systematic review and meta-analysis will provide clinical evidencefor the effectiveness of iron supplementation for PPD, inform our understanding of the value of iron supplementation in improving PPD symptoms, and help clinicians to make better decisionsregarding the appropriate role of iron supplementation as a partof prevention and treatment routines.Author contributions Conceptualization: Yanran Tian, Zeyu Zheng, Chen Ma.Data curation: Yanran Tian, Chen Ma.Formal analysis: Zeyu Zheng, Chen Ma.Funding acquisition: Zeyu Zheng.
