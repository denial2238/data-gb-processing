The prepared UEFG is amilky white solution with a viscosity lower than that offresh egg white, and displayed a particle size distributionprimarily between 100 and 1,200 nm. Stabilityassessments conducted over 28 d at 4°C revealed that UEFG remained stable at pH 6-10, with exceptional sta-bility from pH 8 to 10, while it is less stable in highlyacidic (pH 2-4) or basic environments (pH 12).TheUEFG also showed commendable stability in the presence of salt and sucrose solutions.We report a simple and novel method for preparing UEFG with good ﬂowability after heating treatment.The UEFG has broad applications inthe food industry, such as precooked egg white powder,high protein beverages, composite dairy products, etc.

The formation of egg white thermal gels is one of the primary changes during thecooking process of eggs, playing a critical role in shaping the texture and mouthfeel.In the food industry, the gel- ling properties of egg white are widely applied.However,the formation of egg white thermal gels also presentschallenges and limitations for the use of eggs.For exam-ple, in the processing of liquid egg whites, the formationof thermal gels limits the temperature for pasteurization,consequently restricting the shelf-life of liquid egg whitesto 2 to 4 wk under refrigeration.
Furthermore, the coag- ulation characteristics of heated egg whites also limit their application in the production of beverages andother food processing areas. To expand the use of egg whites, a method for preparing egg white ﬂuidic gels has been developed: egg whites are ﬁrst heated to form a gel, which is then broken down and homogenized throughhigh-speed shearing and other methods, resulting in aﬂowable egg white gel ( Singer and Dunn, 1990 ).How- ever, this “heat-breakdown-homogenize ”method for forming egg white ﬂuidic gels is relatively complex and involves high-energy processes.In recent years, the use of new food processing meth- ods to improve the properties of egg white gels has beenextensively studied, including ultraviolet processing,high-pressure processing, cold plasma, ball-milling treat-ment, and microwave technology.
Among them, ultra-sound technology is a prominent gelling method of eggwhites due to its safety, ef ﬁciency and environmental friendliness ( Mirarab et al., 2023 ). In our previous research, we unexpectedly found that subjecting eggwhites to ultrasonic pretreatment (180 −360 W) followed by heating (72°C, 8 min) can result in the formation ofultrasound-induced egg white ﬂuidic gels (UEFG).These UEFG possess good ﬂowability, with an average particle size of 544.97 nm, and are simple and low-costto prepare, with broad potential applications ( Wang et al., 2022 ).However, the parameters for ultrasonic pre- treatment in preparing UEFG are not yet clear, and thestability of the ﬂuid gels during storage and processing is /C2112024 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.This is an open access article under the CCBY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/ 4.0/).Received April 8, 2024.Accepted May 13, 2024.

The method for ultrasonic treatment of the egg white was slightly modi ﬁed from our previous research ( Geng et al., 2018 ). We placed 1 L of egg white into a 2 L beaker and sub-jected it to ultrasonication using an ultrasonic cellcrusher (JY99-IIDN, maximum power 1,000 W, 20 kHz;Ningbo Xinzhi Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Ningbo, China).The sample was kept in an ice-water bath to preventpotential temperature increases.The ﬁxed parameters for ultrasonic treatment were as follows: the ultrasonic probe had a diameter of 15 mm; it was positioned 15 mmbelow the surface of the egg white; and the ultrasonicpretreatment time and interval were both set to 3 s.After ultrasonic treatment, the FEW was heated in awater bath at 72°C for 10 min to form UEFG.
The effects of varying ultrasonic power density (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 W/mL), ultrasonic processing time (0, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 s), postultrasonication heating tem- peratures (68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80°C), and heatingdurations (0, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 min) on UEFGwere studied. Observation of UEFG Formation Process FEW was placed in a 6-well plate (4 mL/well) and then heated in a 72°C water bath.Photographs were taken every 2 min to monitor the formation of UEFG.Particle Size Distribution and Zeta-Potential Analysis The particle size and zeta-potential of the samples were measured using a Nano particle analyzer (ZS90,Malvern Zetasizer Nano, UK) following the previousmethod ( Ye, et al., 2022 ).
Samples were diluted 100 times with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mM, pH 7.4) and measured at room temperature for both zetapotential and particle size.Rheological Behavior Flow curves were determined using advanced rotary rheometers FEW and UEFG with geometric plates.Shear rheological parameters were set: the test tempera-ture was 25°C, the plate spacing was 1 mm, and the shear rate was 40 to 100 per s. The relationship between shear rate and shear stress was proved by ﬁtting the data with a mathematical model.Shear rate as theabscissa and apparent viscosity ( h) as the ordinate were plotted.Temperature rheological parameter setting:temperature range is 25 to 100°C.Stability Assessment A 28-d stability assessment was conducted for UEFG.The in ﬂuence of pH on UEFG stability: 5 mL of UEFG was placed in a sample bottle, diluted with 4 mL ofdeionized water, the pH of the solution at this time was 8.9§0.1, which was used as the control group for the experiment.
Then adjusted to pH values of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,and 12 using 3 M HCl or NaOH. The total volume wasmade up to 10 mL; the bottles were stored at 4°C for 28d.Samples were taken out and evaluated on d 1, 3, 5, 7,14, 21, and 28.The in ﬂuence of salt and sucrose on UEFG stability: 5 mL of UEFG was placed in samplebottles and mixed with 5 mL of deionized water, salt solution ( ﬁnal concentration 1%, 2%), or sucrose solu- tion ( ﬁnal concentration 5%, 10%).The sample bottles were stored at 4°C for 28 d and evaluated on designateddays.Samples were observed, images were collected, andparticle size distribution, zeta-potential, and turbiditywere measured.All the instruments used in the UEFGstability test were sterilized in advance, and a FEWwere obtained in a super-clean workbench.Deionized water and UEFG small bottles were sterilized in a high- pressure steam sterilizer at 121°C for 30 min.Finally,the bottle was sealed.
Turbidity Measurement Samples were diluted 50 times with deionized water and then measured using a turbidimeter (WZS-188,Shanghai Precision & Scienti ﬁc Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Data Statistical Analysis Each sample was measured at least 3 times.Experi- mental data were expressed as mean values with stan-dard deviation (mean §SD) and analyzed using one- way ANOVA.Duncan ’s multiple comparison test was implemented in GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Soft- ware, San Diego, CA).The Pvalues <0.05 (*) were regarded as a signi ﬁcant difference.2 RESEARCH NOTE RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Formation of UEFG The gelation of FEW (0 W/mL) and UEW (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 W/mL) was monitored and compared at72°C over a period of 0-10 min.FEW began to gel atthe container ’s edges at 4 min, spreading toward the center and eventually solidifying.
The resultsindicated that: 1) Ultrasoni c pretreatment facilitated the formation of a ﬂuid gel in egg whites at 72°C; 2) UEW treated at intensities from 0.2 to 0.6 W/mLformed UEFG with desirable ﬂowability and unifor- mity; 3) UEW treated at higher intensities of 0.8 to1.0 W/mL could still form UEFG, but the texture wasless even and the ﬂowability was compromised.

The different letters a, b and c in Figure 1 G indicate signi ﬁcant differences ( p<0.05).RESEARCH NOTE 3 The required ultrasonic pretreatment time for UEFG formation was studied at a constant ultrasonic power density of 0.25 W/mL, water bath temperature of 72°C,and a duration of 10 min. It was found that with lessthan 150 s of ultrasonication, the gel formed progres-sively from the edge to the center, yielding a non- ﬂuid gel.At the 150 s, increasing heating time led to the for-mation of a milky suspension, culminating in a ﬂuid gel (Figure 1 B).The range of heating temperatures required to form UEFG was examined with a ﬁxed ultrasonic power den- sity of 0.25 W/mL for 4 min, followed by a 10 min waterbath.At 68°C, egg white proteins failed to form a ther-mal gel, indicating insuf ﬁcient denaturation and gela- tion participation.Between 70 and 76°C, highertemperatures increased gelation rate but reduced UEFGﬂuidity.
Above 78°C, the egg white protein gel shifted from ﬂuid to solid ( Figure 1 C). The formation time for UEFG was explored using a constant ultrasonic power density of 0.25 W/mL for4 min, followed by heating at 72°C.Findings revealedthat at 14 min, the egg white thermal gel started to shift,losing ﬂuidity as it moved from a ﬂuid to a solid state.By 16 min, the egg white thermal gel had fully solidi ﬁed (Figure 1 D).Properties of UEFG FEW (without ultrasonic pretreatment) and UEW (pretreated with ultrasonic power density of 0.25 W/mLfor 5 min) were heated at 72°C for 10 min to form eggwhite solid gel ( EWSG ) and UEFG, respectively.To assess the ﬂuidity of the gels, their respective vials were tilted.The results showed that EWSG displayed a mac- roscopically solid and non- ﬂowing state.In contrast, UEFG demonstrated superior ﬂuidity ( Figure 1 E).
The particle size distribution curves for FEW, UEW, and UEFG are depicted in Figure 1 F, primarily distrib- uted within the ranges of 1 to 10 nm, 10 to 100 nm, and100 to 1000 nm. These are speculated to correspond tosmall molecular weight egg white proteins, large molecu- lar weight egg white proteins, and protein aggregates from egg whites, respectively ( Liu et al., 2021 ).The UEW curve showed a shift towards smaller particlediameters compared to FEW, indicating a reduction inegg white protein aggregate size due to ultrasonication.After heating, UEFG displayed a signi ﬁcant presence of protein aggregates, predominantly in the 200-400 nmrange.The zeta potential is a critical parameter for quantify- ing the surface charge on proteins and is indicative ofcolloidal dispersion stability ( Li et al., 2018 ).The abso- lute zeta potential value for UEW was reduced in com-parison to FEW ( Figure 1 G), which aligns with previous research ﬁndings ( Chen et al., 2019 ).
After heating, the absolute value of the zeta potential for UEFG signi ﬁ- cantly increased. This was attributed to the rapid unfolding of heat-sensitive proteins in egg white due to thermal treatment, leading to the exposure of chargedgroups within the proteins to the surface.An increased absolute value of zeta potential results in stronger elec- trostatic repulsion between proteins, thereby improvingthe stability of the egg white system.To compare the viscosity of FEW and UEFG, their ﬂow properties were analyzed with a rotary rheometer.As shown in Figures 1 H and 1I, FEW exhibited shear- thinning behavior, indicative of a pseudoplastic ﬂuid, with viscosity decreasing as shear rate increased.UEFG, however, maintained a consistent viscosity across differ- ent shear rates, characteristic of a Newtonian ﬂuid where viscosity was solely temperature-dependent.Both FEWand UEFG ’s viscosities remained stable up to 80°C, with FEW being the more viscous.
The viscosity ofUEFG experienced a minor shift with a steep tempera-ture increase, likely resulting from ultrasonic treatmentaltering protein interactions. Stability of UEFG The shelf life of UEFG was assessed by refrigerating samples at different pH levels and solvent systems at 4°C for 28 d, and monitoring their appearance, particlesize, zeta potential, and turbidity.The stability of UEFG solutions was highest within a pH range of 8 to 10, maintaining consistency over 28 d.At pH 2, phase separation commenced on d 3, while atpH 4, the solutions quickly destabilized, separating on d1 and showing signi ﬁcant layering by d 3.Improved sta- bility was observed at pH 6, with slight separationonly by d 21.At pH 12, UEFG shifted in color to lightyellow-green and turbidity markedly decreased(Figure 2 A).
These results indicated that lower pH levels led to more layering and reduced stability, likely due to nearing the isoelectric point of egg white proteins, whichdiminished electrostatic repulsion and promoted proteinaggregation. At higher pH values, while UEFG solutionsremained more homogeneous, the proteins were moresusceptible to denaturation in strongly alkaline condi-tions.Figure 2 B presents that on the ﬁrst day, UEFG solutions at pH 6 to 10 had particle sizes mostly ranging from 100 to 2,000 nm, with fewer particles in the 10 to 100 nm and 2,000 to 10,000 nm ranges.As pH decreased,the main peak in particle size distribution shifted right,indicating more protein aggregation.At pH 2 and 4, par-ticles were predominantly in the 1,000 to 10,000 nmrange, with a notable drop in the absolute value of Zetapotential, leading to less electrostatic repulsion andmore aggregation.The lowest absolute Zeta potential and largest protein aggregates occurred at pH 2.
At pH 12, particle sizes remained in the 100 to 2,000 nm range.Turbidity decreased under extreme pH conditions, mostsigniﬁcantly in alkaline environments, while at pH 4 and 6, turbidity increased substantially, re ﬂecting the in ﬂu- ence of solution electrostatic repulsion: the higher theabsolute Zeta potential, the clearer the solution. Furthermore, when UEFG was incorporated into saline solutions at 1% and 2% w/v and sucrose solutions at 5% and 10% w/v, there was no signi ﬁcant layering4 RESEARCH NOTE observed ( Figure 2 C), and the particle size, zeta poten- tial, and turbidity remained comparable to the controlgroup (UEFG diluted equally with deionized water).These ﬁndings suggested that UEFG maintained its sta- bility well in moderate saline and sucrose environments (Figure 2 D).
In this study, optimal ultras onication of UEFG forma- tion was achieved using a power density of 0.2 to0.6 W/mL, with a critical pretreatment time of 150 s.The ideal heating range was found to be between 70 and76°C, with a transition to solid gelation occurring after14 min at 72°C. The UEFG exhibited improved ﬂuidity, smaller particle size, and consistent Newtonian viscosity, distinguishing it from traditional egg white solutions.Our previous research has reported that ovomucin is one ofthe key proteins involved in th e initiation and formationof egg white heat-set gels ( Wang et al., 2022 ).Ultrasonic pretreatment was hypothesized to disrupt interproteininteractions, thereby inhibiting the incorporation of ovo-mucin into the structural matrix of the thermal gel.Thismechanism was suggested to facilitate the formation of a distinct gel state referred to as UEFG.
Stability tests indi- cated that the UEFG is stable for up to 28 d in pH condi-tions between 8 and 10, and in the presence of moderateconcentrations of saline and su crose, suggesting its suit- ability for diverse food industry applications. Further-more, the method for preparing UEFG was compatiblewith existing egg liquid production lines, offering energyand time savings compared to traditional mechanical grinding.Moreover, the ﬂuidity of the gel obtained through this method was superior to that achieved viatraditional “heat-breakdown-homogenize ”method.Figure 2.Stability changes of UEFG solution in 4°C storage environment.Effects of pH on macroscopic appearance changes (A), particle size, zeta potential and turbidity (B) of UEFG solution; Effects of salt solution and sucrose solution on macroscopic appearance changes (C), particlesize, zeta potential and turbidity (D) of UEFG solution.
