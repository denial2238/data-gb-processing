The participants who visited the psychiatric outpatient departmentfrom 2019 onward at Tertiary hospital, Kathmandu, were recruited. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was ad-ministered to the participants by a trained medical doctor.The medical doctor used the MMSE scores to classify the participantsinto two groups: the healthy control group and the AD group.Results: The AD group had higher percentages of hypertension(20.9%), diabetes (13.6%), smoking habit (27.3%), vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency (22.7%), and alcohol consumption (13.8%) relative to the control group.Among these features, a signi ﬁcant association was found between alcohol and vitamin B-12 status and between systolic blood pressure and MMSE score.Conclusion: This study concluded that there is an association between low levels of vitamin B-12 and the risk of AD.Further studies are needed to determine the cause-effect.

Introduction The WHO mentioned Alzheimer ’s disease (AD) as the most common cause of dementia ( Parry & Weiyuan, 2011 ).De- mentia is a generalized decline of intellect, memory, andpersonality without impairment of consciousness, leading to functional impairment.Dementia affects about 25 million people worldwide, with the numbers set to increase dra-matically as life expectancy increases further.AD is con-sidered the biggest killer among the growing elderlypopulation ( Maharaj, 2017 ).Dementia has many causes among older patients; the majority of cases are caused byAlzheimer ’s disease (55%), vascular dementia (20%), and Lewy body dementia (15%) ( Geddes et al., 2012 ).
The risk of vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency among the elderly increased because of the high prevalence of atrophic gastritis-associated foodcobalamin (vitamin B-12) malabsorption andthe increasing prevalence of per nicious anemia with advancing age (Wong, 2015 ). Deﬁciency of the B vitamins (folate, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12) may play a role in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in the elderly through hyper- homocysteinemia ( Parnetti et al., 1997 ).

In the developed countries, 6% of those aged 60 years and above are vitamin B-12 de ﬁcient (plasma vitamin B-12, 148 pmol/L).De ﬁciency is much more common, starting in early life and persisting across the life span, and the prevalence of de ﬁciency is increasing with age in developing countries ( Allen, 2009 ).In addition, vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency is a frequent condition in the elderly population, oftenoverlooked in clinical practice ( Goebels & Soyka, 2000 ).Since the past few years, the number of people with AD has been increasing among the elderly population in Nepal(Baral et al., 2020 ).The causes of AD are poorly understood (Carpenter et al., 2011 ).There is no study regarding plasma vitamin B-12 levels in elderly people and their association with AD in our country.
Though similar studies are done inthe Western world, the study will help to know the associationin our part of the world. Methods A case-control study approved by the institutional authorities was conducted to evaluate the association of plasma vitamin B-12 levels with AD in Nepalese elderly individuals.Theparticipants who visited the psychiatric outpatient departmentfrom 2019 onward at XXX hospital, Kathmandu, with age >60 years were recruited.First, the participants were inter-viewed by trained medical of ﬁcers, applying a structured questionnaire which was designed to obtain the followinginformation regarding general characteristics: age (in years), sex, education, diet habitus, type of family, smoking status, alcohol use, and medical history.The patient ’s height and weight were measured, and their body mass index (BMI)(kg/m 2) was calculated.Second, blood samples were collected from all participants.
The samples were drawnby venipuncture in a Gel/Clot activator tube at the out- patient department and then taken to a specialized lab(Samyak Diagnostic Pvt. Ltd., Lalitpur) where it wascentrifuged for 10 minutes at 3500 rpm.Serum was usedfor the analysis of vitamin B-12 levels.All specimenswere collected and analyzed within the same day.The concentrations of vitamin B-12 were determined in the Advia Centaur XP instrument based on CLIA technology.This is a competitive imm unoassay using direct (CLIA) chemiluminescent technology.The normal value for vi-tamin B-12 is 239 –931 pg/mL ( Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc, 2013 ).Finally, a trained medical doc- tor used the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)(Folstein et al., 1975 ) to measure cognitive functions and determine the risk of AD.Analysis Data are expressed as the frequency, mean, and SD.The MMSE scores were used to classify participants into 2groups: (1) healthy control group and (2) AD group.
Baselinevalues were compared among AD and control groups using independent student t-test and strati ﬁed analysis using the MantelHaenszel chi-square test. All analyses were performedusing "Statistical Packages for the Social Science" IBMstatistics version 20.Results The demographic, clinical, and biochemical characteristics of the healthy and AD groups are shown in Table 1 .In terms of their demographic, though mean age was more in the controlgroup, the analysis showed statistical signi ﬁcance with re- lation to age.More females with 60.9% and well economicstatus group with 97.8%, were in the control group whereas Table 1.Demographic, Clinical, and Biochemical Characteristics of Case and Control Group.

3 present study, we identi ﬁed that a low serum level of vitamin B-12 is signi ﬁcantly associated with the risk of AD. In our study, there were more female and more MMSE scores in thecontrol group, which is similar to Refsum and Smith ’s study (Refsum & Smith, 2003 ), and Ma et al.’s study ( Ma et al., 2017 ).In our study, more smokers were in the AD group than the control group, which is inconsistent with Ma et al.’s study but similar to Refsum and Smith ’s study.In the present study, we identi ﬁed that AD is signi ﬁcantly associated with a low serum level of vitamin B-12.This isconsistent with the study ﬁndings by Tucker et al.( Tucker et al., 2005 ), whereas it is inconsistent with the ﬁndings of the Kungsholmen population-based study ( Abyad, 2002 ; Smith et al., 2008 ), the Bronx Longitudinal Aging Study (Goebels & Soyka, 2000 ), and a case-control study by Ma et al.(2017) .
A study done by Refsum and Smith (2003) found that the holotranscobalamin level was more strongly associated withAlzheimer ’s disease and with cognitive function scores in controls. A similar ﬁnding in elderly people has already been reported ( Bjorksten et al., 2001 ).There are limitations to our study.Since this is a case- control study, we can prove causality.Our result could not apply to the general population as we did not use randomsamples from the general elderly population.Despite theabove limitations, based on the ﬁndings of this study, it can be concluded that the low levels of vitamin B-12 may be as-sociated with the risk of AD in elderly people.The futurelongitudinal studies need to plan in these areas to show theevidence for the relationships of holotranscobalamine and cognition.Conclusion This study concluded that there is an association between low levels of vitamin B-12 levels and Alzheimer ’s disease, though not proof as a causal factor.
Different factors play a role in thecausation of Alzheimer ’s disease. If we could identify the particular causal factor, this disease could be prevented in advance.Recommendation Subjects with Alzheimer ’s disease often have impaired co- balamine status, which can be corrected by treatment withvitamin B-12.Hence, based on our study ﬁndings, which showed association but not proof of causal relationship, large, randomized controlled trials are required to get solid evidence.Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank all the subjects for their participation and thanks to medical doctors of the psychiatric department of ShreeBirendra Hospital, Kathmandu.Declaration of Con ﬂicting interests The author(s) declared no potential con ﬂicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.Funding The author(s) received no ﬁnancial support for the research, au- thorship, and/or publication of this article.
