In maternal–fetal environments, increased plasma α-tocopherol concentrations are associated with positive birth outcomes, while higher γ- tocopherol concentrations are linked with negative pregnancy outcomes. However, little is known about tocopherol concentrations in placental tissue and their role in modulating placental oxidative stress, a process that is implicated in many complications of pregnancy.The objectives of this research are to evaluate the concentrations of α- and γ-tocopherol in placental tissue and assess relationships with maternal and umbilical cord plasma concentrations.A total of 82 mother–infant dyads were enrolled at the time of delivery, and maternal and umbilical cord blood samples and placenta samples were collected.α- and γ-tocopherol concentrations in these samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).γ-tocopherol concentrations demonstrated signiﬁcant, positive correlations among all sample types ( p-values < 0.001).
Placental tissue had a signiﬁcantly lower ratio of α:γ-tocopherol concentrations when compared to maternal plasma and umbilical cord plasma (2.9 vs. 9.9 vs.13.2, respectively; p< 0.001).Additional research should explore possible mechanisms for tocopherol storage and transfer in placental tissue and assess relationships between placental tocopherol concentrations and measures of maternal–fetal oxidative stress and clinical outcomes of pregnancy.Keywords: tocopherol; pregnancy; placenta; vitamin E 1.Introduction Altered nutrition or metabolism during fetal development lays the foundation for newborn infants and predisposes them to conditions throughout adulthood [ 1].Maternal nutrition evidently has an impact on fetal nutrition and growth, and our group has previ- ously identiﬁed relationships between fat-soluble nutrient concentrations in the mother and infant [ 2–4].
Vitamin E is a unique fat-soluble nutrient that exists in eight isoforms, with α- andγ-tocopherol being the most well-studied isoforms due to their high concentrations in the human diet and biological tissues. Additionally, α-tocopherol meets the full criteria for classiﬁcation as an antioxidant, a compound found in the typical human diet that prevents cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen species [ 5].Because of this ability to reduce oxidative stress, α-tocopherol has been examined in many aspects of antenatal and post- natal development.For example, lower maternal α-tocopherol concentrations have been associated with preterm delivery and low infant birthweight [ 6].Lower infant α-tocopherol concentrations are associated with hemolytic anemia in low-birth-weight infants, lung inﬂammation with elevations in neutrophils and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, and the Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 1797.

Furthermore, fetal storage of α-tocopherol tends to occur in the third trimester of pregnancy.This may explain why preterm infants are born with lower body concentrations than term infants, all while facing a larger postnatal oxidative stress burden [8].Research has generally reached a consensus on the antioxidant activity of α-tocopherol, but our understanding of γ-tocopherol is much more varied.Several studies suggest that α- andγ-tocopherol have opposing anti-inﬂammatory properties, with γ-tocopherol exerting mostly pro-inﬂammatory activity in human tissues [ 10].
Indeed, γ-tocopherol has been shown to increase in vivo inﬂammation by promoting lymphocyte migration [ 10], and higher γ-tocopherol concentrations have been associated with inﬂammatory conditions like osteoarthritis and asthma [ 11–13]. The pro-inﬂammatory actions of γ-tocopherol appear to relate to increased IFN- γactivity and increased cytokine production (IL-2, IL-4) [ 1].Meanwhile, α-tocopherol exerts anti-inﬂammatory effects by modulating the signaling pathways involved in the expression of pro-inﬂammatory genes [ 2].The opposing an- tioxidant properties of α- and γ-tocopherol further relate to their unique biochemical structures [ 14].All tocopherol isoforms contain a chromane ring with a hydroxyl group and a hydrophobic side chain for penetration into biological membranes.α-tocopherol has additional methyl groups near its chromanol ring that allow for resonance stabilization and free radical reduction [14].
In general, tocopherols are important micronutrients found in a variety of dietary sources. Nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, and green leafy vegetables are all good sources of vitamin E, especially the α-tocopherol isoform.The current recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin E is 15 milligrams (mg)/day, measured exclusively as its α-tocopherol isoform.There are no current recommendations for appropriate amounts of other isoforms.As a whole, the American diet is heavily inﬂuenced by processed oils rich in γ-tocopherol (i.e., wheat germ, soybean, canola, corn, and vegetable oils) [ 15].Individuals, speciﬁcally pregnant women, also tend to consume additional nutrients in daily multivitamins, which typically contain only the α-tocopherol isoform at a dose of around 90% of their RDA [16].In maternal–fetal environments, nutrient absorption and subsequent biological activity are also regulated and affected by the placenta.
The placenta is a vital organ that provides nutrients, oxygen, and waste product removal for the developing fetus via the umbilical vessels. Some nutrients are transferred from mother to baby via facilitated diffusion.For larger, less membrane-permeable substances, ionic gradients regulate transporter proteins and allow nutrients to cross from the placenta to the baby’s umbilical vessels [ 17].Vitamin E is one such compound that transfers via a membrane protein, referred to as α-tocopherol transfer protein ( α-TTP) [ 18–20].Initial research into the transfer of tocopherol isoforms in maternal–fetal environments demonstrates lower umbilical cord concentrations of vitamin E isoforms compared to maternal plasma concentrations [ 21].However, to our knowledge, placental concentrations of vitamin E isoforms have not yet been described.
Through investigation of this unique organ, there is an opportunity to gain insights into the dynamics of maternal–fetal nutrition status, which may later allow for nutritional interventions that enhance body concentrations and perinatal health. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the concentration of vitamin E isoforms, including α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol, in placental tissue and its relationship with ma- ternal and umbilical cord plasma concentrations.Seeking to understand more about dietary intake, nutrition status, and overall health in vulnerable populations, this study explores tocopherol concentrations and the process of nutrient transfer in mother–infant dyads.2.
Materials and Methods Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval through the University of Ne- braska Medical Center (IRB #112-15-EP), 82 mother–infant pairs were recruited at the time of delivery from the Labor and Delivery Unit, Newborn Nursery, and Level III academic Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Infants made wards of the state or those with a Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 1797 3 of 12 prenatal diagnosis of congenital abnormalities or maternal gastrointestinal, liver, or kidney disease that affects nutrient metabolism were excluded.At delivery, maternal and cord blood plasma specimens were collected, as well as approximately 1 cm3cross-sections of placental tissue.Specimens were protected from heat and light and promptly frozen at −80◦C within 12 h of clinical procurement, pending bulk analysis.2.1.Quantiﬁcation of Plasma and Placental Tocopherol Concentrations All samples were analyzed at the Harvard School of Public Health Nutritional Biomarker Lab.
Measurements of α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol were obtained in cord blood samples, maternal plasma samples, and maternal placenta samples. Individual placenta sample weights were recorded in grams (g).Then, samples were homogenized in distilled, deion- ized water using mechanical pulverization (Polytron PT1200, Kinematica AG, Lucerne, Switzerland) to create an aqueous slurry.Both placenta and plasma samples were mixed in a 1:1 ratio of 250 µL plasma to 250 mL ethanol with 10 µg rac-tocopherol/mL as an internal standard.Both placenta and plasma samples were then extracted with 4 mL hex- ane, evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, and reconstituted in 100 mL ethanol-dioxane and 150 mL acetonitrile.Biological concentrations of tocopherols in the samples were quantiﬁed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Restek Ultra C18 150 mm, 4.6 mm column with a 3 µm particle size encased in a column oven (Hitachi L-2350, Hitachi, San Jose, CA, USA).
This equipment prevents temperature ﬂuctuations and is equipped with a trident guard cartridge system (Restek, Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA). A mobile phase was analyzed with a mixture of acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, and a 1% ammonium acetate solution (68:22:7:3) at a ﬂow rate of 1.1 mL/min with a Hitachi L-2310 pump in isocratic mode, a Hitachi L-2455 diode array detector (300 nm and 445 nm), and a Hitachi L-2200 auto-sampler with water chilled tray.Four control samples were analyzed with each run for internal quality control.External quality control was monitored by participation in the standardization program for tocopherol analysis from the National Institute of Standards and Technology USA.Concentrations of α- and γ-tocopherol were reported in micrograms/gram ( µg/g) for placental tissue samples and in micrograms/liter (µg/L) for maternal and umbilical cord plasma samples.2.2.
Evaluation of Dietary Nutrient Intake At the time of delivery, mothers completed the Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), a comprehensive dietary intake survey that has been validated in all adults and pregnant women [ 22]. It has greater utility over other methods of nutrient intake assessment (i.e., 24-h recalls) as it is more reﬂective of intake over time.Longitudinal dietary intake is calculated using questionnaire responses and the established nutrient content of selected foods, a process completed by trained personnel at the Harvard School of Public Health.Vitamin E intake is reported as milligrams/day of individual tocopherol isoforms.Maternal intake adequacy of α-tocopherol was assessed using the Institute of Medicine’s daily recommendation of ≥15 mg/day [5].2.3.Collection of Other Demographic Data Demographic information was collected on the maternal–infant pair using the elec- tronic medical record.
Maternal age and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI, in kilograms/meters2(kg/m2)) were recorded. Characteristics from the time of delivery included mode of delivery (cesarean section vs.vaginal birth), infant gestational age, and birth weight in grams (g).Birth weight metrics were plotted on the 2013 Fenton growth chart for infants <37 weeks gestation or the World Health Organization 0–2 year growth chart for infants if ≥37 weeks gestation, and subsequent percentile rankings were recorded [23].Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 1797 4 of 12 2.4.Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were generated for each variable of interest, including medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.Non-parametric statistical testing, including the Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis test, compared continuous data between groups.
Spearman’s corre- lation coefﬁcients were utilized to relate maternal plasma, cord plasma, and placental tissue tocopherol concentrations. All dataset analysis was completed using SPSS version 29.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.3.Results The median maternal age was 29.0 years, with a median maternal pre-pregnancy BMI of 28.9 kg/m2.A total of 80.5% of infants were born via vaginal delivery.The median birth gestational age was 39.7 weeks, and 2.4% of infants were born preterm (CGA < 37 weeks ).A total of 8.5% of infants required NICU admission, and maternal complications like gesta- tional diabetes and pre-eclampsia were found in 7.3% and 1.2% of mothers, respectively.The median total maternal dietary tocopherol intake was 24.7 mg/day, and 52.4% of moth- ers met the RDA for adequate vitamin E intake.
For mothers meeting the RDA, the median α-tocopherol intake was 22.9 mg/day, compared to 10.7 mg/day for mothers who did not meet the RDA. Additional demographic data are included below in Table 1.Table 1.Maternal and Infant Demographics.Variable Median Interquartile Range Maternal age (years) 29.0 24.0–33.0 Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (kg/m2) 28.9 22.9–32.6 Birth gestational age 39.7 39.0–40.6 Infant birth weight (g) 3523 3295.5–3830.5 Maternal total tocopherol intake (mg/day) 24.7 18.6–32.3 Maternal α-tocopherol intake (mg/day) 15.7 10.9–23.6 Maternal γ-tocopherol intake (mg/day) 8.5 6.6–12.4 The median placental concentrations for α- and γ-tocopherol ( µg/g) were 1.44 and 0.46, respectively.Median maternal tocopherol plasma concentrations ( µg/L) were higher than umbilical cord tocopherol concentrations ( µg/L) for both α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol (p-values < 0.001, Table 2).
The ratio of median α-tocopherol concentrations in maternal plasma compared to umbilical cord blood was 6.25, meaning maternal plasma contained approximately 6.25 times the amount of α-tocopherol compared to umbilical cord blood. Maternal plasma contained even higher concentrations of γ-tocopherol compared to umbil- ical cord blood, with a maternal–cord ratio of 9.08 (Table 2).Table 2.Median Tocopherol Concentrations and Interquartile Range within Placenta, Maternal, and Umbilical Cord Plasma.Placenta ( µg/g)Maternal Plasma (µg/L)Umbilical Cord Plasma ( µg/L)Ratio of Maternal–Cord Tocopherol Concentrations α-tocopherol1.44 (0.41–2.37)17,892.9 (14,910.2–20,699.7)2861.8 (2061.1–3600.4)6.25 γ-tocopherol0.46 (0.30–0.70)1783.7 (1310.8–2469.1)196.4 (147.6–295.9)9.08 In all biological samples, α-tocopherol comprised a higher tocopherol proportion compared to γ-tocopherol.The median α:γtocopherol ratio was signiﬁcantly higher in umbilical cord blood compared to placenta (13.2 vs.
2.9; p< 0.001). α:γtocopherol ratios between maternal plasma and placenta were also signiﬁcantly different (9.9 vs.2.9; Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 1797 5 of 12 p< 0.001).Maternal plasma and umbilical cord blood did not differ signiﬁcantly in α:γ tocopherol ratios ( p-value = 0.08) despite umbilical cord blood containing a higher ratio of α:γtocopherol at 13.2 (Table 3).Table 3.α:γ-Tocopherol Ratios within Placenta, Maternal, and Umbilical Cord Plasma.Placenta Maternal Plasma Umbilical Cord Plasma α:γ-tocopherol 2.9 9.9 13.2 p-value (Kruskal–Wallis Test) Placenta with Maternal Plasma <0.001 Placenta with Umbilical Cord Plasma <0.001 Maternal Plasma with Umbilical Cord Plasma 0.08 The concentration of α-tocopherol in maternal plasma demonstrated a signiﬁcant positive correlation with total maternal tocopherol intake (R = 0.26, p= 0.02).γ-tocopherol intake was signiﬁcantly associated with α-tocopherol concentrations in maternal plasma (R = 0.24, p= 0.03).
There were no signiﬁcant correlations between total or isoform- speciﬁc intake and γ-tocopherol concentrations in the biological tissues. However, γ- tocopherol concentrations demonstrated signiﬁcant positive correlations between all three biological sample types.The strongest relationship was observed between γ-tocopherol concentrations in maternal plasma and placenta tissue (R = 0.61, p<0.001).There were no signiﬁcant correlations for concentrations of α-tocopherol within maternal plasma, umbilical cord blood, or placenta (Table 4).Table 4.Spearman’s Correlation Coefﬁcients of Tocopherol Concentrations for Maternal Dietary Intake and Placenta, Maternal, and Umbilical Cord Plasma Concentrations.

This study expands our knowledge of maternal–fetal transfer dynamics by making comparisons between proportions of α- and γ-tocopherol within placental tissue, as well as maternal and umbilical cord plasma. To our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst to report correlations among the major tocopherol isoforms within maternal blood, umbilical cord blood, and Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 1797 6 of 12 placenta.In this way, this study further characterizes vitamin E transfer dynamics in maternal–fetal environments, paving the way for additional studies into these mechanisms and clinical impacts.4.1.Dietary Intake Only 52.4% (n = 43) of mothers met the RDA for adequate intake of vitamin E, with a median α-tocopherol intake of 15.7 mg/day.The subset of mothers who failed to meet the RDA for vitamin E intake had a low median α-tocopherol intake of only 10.7 mg/day.This relatively high proportion of dietary inadequacy is consistent with prior studies in both American and Asian women [ 24,25].
This study also demonstrated signiﬁcant positive, though weak, correlations between maternal plasma concentrations of α-tocopherol and maternal total tocopherol and γ-tocopherol intake. This contrasts with several other studies that failed to detect signiﬁcant associations between tocopherol intake and serum toco- pherol concentrations in various European cohorts [ 26–29].However, these studies were not speciﬁc to pregnant women and often adjusted for additional factors like age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and serum lipid concentrations.Our study did not demon- strate signiﬁcant relationships between dietary intake and tocopherol isoforms in umbilical cord blood or placenta tissue.Nearly half of the mothers in our study had inadequate toco- pherol intake, and it is possible that reduced tocopherol intake affects the balance between maternal utilization of this nutrient and its transfer to the growing fetus.
Furthermore, pregnancy is an inﬂammatory state [ 30], and it is plausible that the biological utilization of vitamin E as a potent antioxidant may differ during pregnancy and affect serum and tissue concentrations. Our cohort of pregnant women also had a median pre-pregnancy BMI in the overweight range (BMI 28.9 kg/m2).Studies have shown individuals with greater adiposity tend to have lower circulating concentrations of vitamin E isoforms, possibly due to increased consumption from weight-related oxidative stress [ 31,32].Overall, these ﬁndings promote further research into dietary and inﬂammatory confounders that may affect vitamin E metabolism, such as smoking status and obesity, and suggest a possible mechanism for tocopherol transfer in maternal–fetal environments that accounts for more than isoform intake.
Our study also demonstrated a proportional intake of γ-tocopherol, accounting for around 34% of total maternal tocopherol intake, with a median γ-tocopherol intake of 8.5 mg/day and a median total tocopherol intake of 24.7 mg/day. Overall, there is no established recommendation for γ-tocopherol intake nor any previous research into stan- dardized intake proportions in comparison to α-tocopherol.However, there is evidence thatγ-tocopherol is an increasingly prevalent isoform in the average American diet, given its presence in plant oils within more processed foods [ 33].Speciﬁcally, the concentra- tion of γ-tocopherol is highest in corn and soybean oils, and concentrations exceed the α-tocopherol content due to increased loss of the α-tocopherol isoform during oil reﬁn- ing processes [ 34,35].In our study, we found greater α-tocopherol intake compared to γ-tocopherol intake in our cohort of pregnant women.
This may be explained by additional dietary supplementation of the α-tocopherol isoform via prenatal vitamins in this cohort, a factor we did not separately analyze. Additionally, our study failed to demonstrate signiﬁcant correlations between dietary tocopherol intake and the subsequent concentra- tion of γ-tocopherol in multiple biologic tissues.These ﬁndings may be explained by the competitive binding and absorption of α- and γ-tocopherol in hepatic tissue.Both iso- forms competitively bind to the same tocopherol transfer protein.Typically, α-tocopherol is preferentially bound, leaving more γ-tocopherol free ﬂoating in the plasma [ 36].This process creates an inverse association between α-tocopherol intake and biologically avail- able γ-tocopherol.It is also possible that there is a differential metabolism of tocopherol isoforms during the pro-inﬂammatory state of pregnancy that affects tissue storage and concentrations [30].Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 1797 7 of 12 4.2.
Plasma Concentrations Concentrations of γ-tocopherol in maternal plasma, umbilical cord blood, and placenta demonstrated moderately strong and signiﬁcant positive correlations with one another. In contrast, there were no signiﬁcant correlations for α-tocopherol concentrations among the biological samples.These ﬁndings are consistent with previous reports depicting the correlations of α- and γ-tocopherol concentrations in maternal plasma and umbilical cord blood.For example, Yeum et al.reported a high correlation between cord and maternal γ-tocopherol concentrations with no signiﬁcant correlation for α-tocopherol [ 37].Kiely et al.studied a larger sample size and concluded a signiﬁcant relationship between γ-tocopherol in maternal and cord plasma [ 38].
As aforementioned, these increased γ- tocopherol concentrations in plasma may be partially explained by the stronger competitive binding of α-tocopherol with plasma transfer proteins, which creates higher free-ﬂoating γ-tocopherol concentrations [ 36]. Furthermore, γ-tocopherol is known to have less afﬁnity for tissue receptors like α-TTP , which may prevent it from being absorbed and utilized by bodily tissues [ 39].Knowing this raises signiﬁcant questions about the clinical impact of higher plasma γ-tocopherol, as this unbound form may be biologically unavailable.Explanations for the lack of signiﬁcance of α-tocopherol correlations across biological samples are twofold.First, research into tocopherol metabolites like carboxyethyl hydrox- ychromans (CEHCs) demonstrated elevated concentrations of these compounds in cord blood, which implies fetal or maternal metabolism of vitamin E [ 40].
This may explain the lack of signiﬁcant correlations for parent compounds in maternal–fetal blood samples. Sec- ond, as alluded to previously, the relative afﬁnity of α-tocopherol for both plasma transport and tissue receptor proteins may allow greater absorption and metabolism compared to the γ-tocopherol isoform.Despite these hypotheses, the exact explanation for the variability in correlations of tocopherol isoforms in biological samples is unclear.Further research is warranted into tocopherol receptors, metabolites, and in vivo activity.4.3.Placenta Concentrations There were lower α- toγ-tocopherol ratios in the placenta compared to maternal or umbilical cord blood, which may suggest increased accumulation of the γ-tocopherol iso- form within placental tissue.Furthermore, the higher maternal–cord ratio for γ-tocopherol compared to α-tocopherol suggests less direct transfer of this isoform from maternal to fetal circulation and would support this same theory.
Overall, there is limited literature on γ-tocopherol concentrations in human tissues, and the focus has mainly been on adipose and epithelial tissues [ 41]. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to evaluate tocopherol isoforms in placental tissue and demonstrate lower ratios of α- toγ-tocopherol in this bio- logical sample.Despite the lack of previous investigation into γ-tocopherol in the placenta, existing literature has documented descriptive evidence of the transport of α-tocopherol in the placenta, which occurs via serum lipoproteins and α-TTP [ 18–20].Overall, studies have further demonstrated an inefﬁcient transfer rate of α-tocopherol in the placenta, hypoth- esized to be due to low expression of lipoprotein or α-TTP in placental tissue [ 18,42–44].Interestingly, γ-tocopherol is believed to have a lower afﬁnity for α-TTP [ 39], which calls into question the apparent higher absorption observed in our study.
Therefore, it is un- likely that γ-tocopherol outcompetes α-tocopherol for placental absorption via α-TTP . It is possible that there are additional placenta receptors other than α-TTP that preferentially allow for γ-tocopherol absorption.Additionally, the placental metabolism of α-tocopherol could explain the lower concentration of this isoform in placental tissue.Although research to date has been unable to quantify metabolites like CEHCs or the enzymes involved in tocopherol metabolism within placental tissue [ 40,45], the research overall is too limited to draw conclusions.Another possible explanation for the increased proportion of γ-tocopherol in placental tissue may relate to the preferential transfer of α-tocopherol to fetal tissues.Although we did not directly analyze fetal tissue in this study, the reduced maternal–cord ratio for α-tocopherol compared to γ-tocopherol supports this hypothesis.
α-tocopherol is a known Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 1797 8 of 12 antioxidant, and the fetal environment is often uniquely and negatively affected by oxida- tive stress. In fact, previous studies suggest that lower infant α-tocopherol concentrations are associated with worsening oxidative stress and poorer outcomes, including intraventric- ular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neurodevelopmental delay, and stunting of growth [ 31,46].It is possible that the maternal–fetal environment values the antioxidant properties of α-tocopherol and preferentially passes this isoform to the developing fetus in utero.Furthermore, postnatal studies on maternal breast milk support preferential transfer ofα-tocopherol compared to γ-tocopherol and promote signiﬁcantly greater proportions of theα-tocopherol isoform in early breast milk, also known as colostrum, which may serve to mediate postnatal inﬂammation in the newborn [47].
By quantifying tocopherol isoforms in placental tissue, our ﬁndings raise further questions regarding their metabolism and biological implications within the maternal– fetal environment. Placental dysregulation and oxidative stress have consistently been suspected of causing many of the common problems in pregnancy.Indeed, oxidative stress within placental tissue has shown frequent correlation and possible causation with multiple adverse outcomes like pre-eclampsia, premature delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, spontaneous abortion, and neonatal demise [ 48–52].As outlined previously, there is well-established evidence for the role of vitamin E isoforms in mediating inﬂammation and oxidative stress.In relation to the maternal–fetal environment, studies have demonstrated improved placental function and lower oxidative stress burden, as measured by various biochemical markers, in high-risk mothers who were supplemented with vitamin E during pregnancy [ 53].
However, this study only supplemented with the α-tocopherol isoform of vitamin E and failed to measure isoform concentrations in placental tissue or assess the role of other isoforms like γ-tocopherol on placental inﬂammation. This omission of γ-tocopherol analysis is critical, as there is mixed evidence regarding the exact pro- or anti-inﬂammatory nature of this tocopherol in maternal–fetal environments.Prior studies have associated increased maternal serum γ-tocopherol concentrations with preterm birth and chorioamnionitis, while other studies have shown positive correlations with γ- tocopherol and better Apgar scores and neonatal growth parameters [ 6,7,54].Additionally, Thoene et al.analyzed relationships between tocopherol isoforms and inﬂammatory compounds in mother–infant dyads and discovered a signiﬁcant negative association between the concentration of γ-tocopherol in placental tissue and the concentration of pro- inﬂammatory IL-8 in maternal serum [ 3].
Taken in context with our ﬁndings demonstrating increased γ-tocopherol concentrations in placental tissue, further exploration of the clinical outcomes related to placental tocopherol concentrations is warranted. We suggest that future research in this area is needed to enhance our understanding of the placental metabolism and transport of γ-tocopherol, along with its clinical implications.4.4.Strengths and Limitations The strengths of the current study include its novel assessment of tocopherol isoforms in placental tissue, an area of perinatal nutrition that has not yet been studied.Our evalua- tion of a population (n = 82) with a complete collection of paired placental tissue, maternal and umbilical cord blood, and maternal dietary information allowed for stronger analysis and enhanced understanding of vitamin E transfer dynamics in maternal–infant dyads.Our study has multiple limitations.
We did not evaluate tocopherol isoform concentra- tions alongside total lipid or inﬂammatory concentrations in individual patients. Due to the transport of plasma lipoproteins, total tocopherol concentrations are known to be affected by abnormal lipid concentrations [ 20,55].We also did not adjust for other demographic variables that may inﬂuence metabolism, nutrient concentration, or dietary intake, such as obesity [ 31,32], smoking status [ 56,57], or medication use [ 58,59].We acknowledge that this may have impacted our results.Additionally, most (97.6%) of the above data are from term-delivered mother–infant dyads, which makes it challenging to generalize our ﬁndings to the preterm population most impacted by low antioxidant capacity.Subsequent studies should aim at including preterm infants, as known variation exists in transfer rates of Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 1797 9 of 12 nutrients among these populations.
Further, our maternal–infant population had low rates of perinatal complications (pre-eclampsia, NICU admission, etc.), which prevented analysis of placental tocopherol concentrations between distinct clinical outcome groups. Our study population also included a large proportion of mothers with inadequate α-tocopherol intake; however, it is important to note that this may reﬂect existing perinatal populations, as high dietary inadequacy of vitamin E has been observed in multiple other studies [ 24,25].5.Conclusions This study demonstrates a correlation between maternal dietary intake of both total tocopherols and γ-tocopherol and maternal plasma concentrations of α-tocopherol only.γ-tocopherol was the only isoform to exhibit signiﬁcant correlations among all biological samples.Most notably, the ratio of α:γ-tocopherol demonstrates tissue-speciﬁc variation and is lowest in placental tissue compared to maternal or umbilical cord blood.
More research is needed to identify the relationship of these ﬁndings to clinical outcomes in the mother and offspring, and this research would beneﬁt from studying a larger maternal– infant population with higher rates of perinatal complications.
