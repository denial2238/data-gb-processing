Abstract: Synthetic antibiotics have captured the market in recent years, but the side effects of these products are life-threatening.
In recent times, researchers have focused their research on natural- based products such as natural herbal oils, which are eco-friendly, biocompatible, biodegradable, and antibacterial. In this study, polyethylene oxide (PEO) and aqueous ginger extract (GE) were electrospun to produce novel antibacterial nanomembrane sheets as a function of PEO and GE concentrations.A GE average particle size of 91.16 nm was achieved with an extensive ﬁltration process, inferring their incorporation in the PEO nanoﬁbres.The presence of the GE was conﬁrmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) through peaks of phenol and aromatic groups.The viscoelastic properties of PEO/GE solutions were analysed in terms of PEO and GE concentrations.Increasing PEO and GE concentrations increased the solution’s viscosity.The dynamic viscosity of 3% was not changed with increasing shear rate, indicating Newtonian ﬂuid behaviour.
The dynamic viscosity of 4 and 5 wt% PEO/GE solutions containing 10% GE increased exponentially compared to 3 wt%. In addition, the shear thinning behaviour was observed over a frequency range of 0.05 to 100 rad/s.Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis also speciﬁed an increase in the nanoﬁbre’s diameter with increasing PEO concentration, while SEM images displayed smooth morphology with beadless nanoﬁbres at different PEO/GE concentrations.In addition, PEO/GE nanomembranes inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, as presented by qualitative antibacterial results.The extent of PEO/GE nanomembrane’s antibacterial activity was further investigated by the agar dilution method, which inhibited the 98.79% Staphylococcus aureus population at 30% GE concentration.Keywords: polyethylene oxide; ginger extract; antibacterial; dynamic light scattering; viscoelas- tic properties 1.
Introduction In 2018, a study published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimated that about 33,000 people die every year of infections as a direct con- sequence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [ 1]. Innovative antibacterial agents are needed against ever-evolving bacteria as they develop resistance to existing antibacterial agents Membranes 2022 ,12, 1148.https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes12111148 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/membranes Membranes 2022 ,12, 1148 2 of 15 over time.In addition, metal-based nanoparticles have been popular antibacterial agents in the past decades.Although metal-based nanoparticles are effective against bacteria and pathogens, there are doubts about their potential risk of toxicity [ 2–7].The use of plant extracts and essential oils for therapeutic purposes has a long history due to their bulk availability and better biocompatibility.
Extracts of different parts of plants (roots, seeds, leaves, ﬂowers, and peels) had been used even in the Stone Age. Even modern medicine contains a signiﬁcant amount of plant extracts because such extracts are valuable, cost-effective, and environment-friendly solutions against bacteria [8–13].Ginger (Zingiber ofﬁcinale Roscoe) is the rhizome of the monocotyledons member of the zingiberaceae plant family.Ginger’s medical and biological potential has been tested and studied for a broad range of biological activities such as analgesic, antitumor, anti- fungal, antioxidant, anti-allergic, anti-inﬂammatory, and antimicrobial.The antimicrobial properties of the ginger oils, ginger extract, and oleoresins depend upon their chemical compositions.The composition is ultimately dependent on cultivation conditions, climate, and soil factors, all of which may change the chemical constitution of the ginger [ 14].
Previous studies revealed that the phenolic compounds, along with combinations of β-sesquiphellandrene, cis-caryophillene, zingiberene, α-farnesene, α- and β-bisabolene are responsible for the antibacterial properties of ginger essential oil, extracts, and oleoresins (eugenol, shogaols, zingerone, gingerdiols, gingerols, etc.). These phenolic compounds are protein denaturants and lead to swelling and rupture of the bacterial cell [ 15–18].Extraction technique is one of the many factors that affect the quality and antibacterial properties of bioactive compounds [ 19,20].Solvent extraction (ethanol, methanol, water, etc.), microwave assisted extraction, ultrasonic assisted extraction, botanical extraction, and soxhlet extraction are the most commonly used methods to obtain plant extracts.All these methods require solvents or treatments prior to the extraction [ 21–23].
Ginger extract and essential oils have been used in hydrogels, ﬁlms, and composites as antibacterial, antioxi- dant, and antifouling agents in the pharmaceutical and food packaging industries [ 24–28]. However, ginger is rarely studied as a nanoﬁbre or part of a nanoﬁbre due to its complex and coarse structure and processing issues.The separation of ginger nanoparticles from extract through vacuum ﬁltration has not been investigated in the literature.The vacuum ﬁltration process is used as a post-treatment for the puriﬁcation of extracts [ 29].In this study, ginger nanoparticles were separated by a cost-efﬁcient and simple setup of vacuum ﬁltration without any solvent.Nanoﬁbres are ﬁne threads having diameters in the range of 50–500 nm and are well- known for their unique properties such as a large surface area to volume ratio, lightweight, high porosity, and bioactivity.
Such physical properties have made them favourites for numerous sensor, membrane, ﬁlter, tissue engineering, wound dressing, and protective clothing applications [ 30–38]. There are several methods to produce nanoﬁbres, such as drawing techniques, phase separation, self-assembly, freeze-drying synthesis, electrospin- ning, and interfacial polymerization of nanoﬁbres [ 39–42].Electrospinning is a unique method of producing nanoﬁbre-based nanomembranes.This is a simple technique due to its ease of use, process ﬂexibility, and manageable setup for nanomembrane production.The nanoﬁbre structure can be modiﬁed using many different designs based on the spin- nerets’ type, shape, size, number, arrangement of needles, and spinning methods [ 43–46].Single needle-based electrospinning is a traditional method that has now been replaced with other techniques to increase the throughput, improve the efﬁciency, and improve the quality of the electrospinning process [47–52].
Polyethylene oxide (PEO) is a synthetic, biodegradable polymer belonging to the thermoplastics family. In addition, PEO is a versatile polymer because it is hydrophilic and soluble in water.PEO is an FDA-approved nontoxic and non-immunogenic polymer, which makes it biocompatible and human-friendly [ 53].These attributes and the easy spinnability of PEO are reasons for the widespread use of PEO nanoﬁbres in the biomedical and pharmaceutical ﬁelds [54–56].Membranes 2022 ,12, 1148 3 of 15 This study combines ginger and PEO to produce nanomembranes for potential appli- cations as a wound dressing.The impact of polymer concentration and ginger content were rheologically investigated and correlated with the production of nanofibre-based membranes.Agar qualitative and quantitative tests confirmed the nano fibres’ antibacterial activity .2.Materials & Methods 2.1.Materials Polyethylene oxide (99% pure) of an average molecular weight of 1,000,000 g/mol was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, St.

HPLC Grade Water was purchased from Daejung, Korea.Ginger was purchased from the local market of Faisalabad, Pakistan.2.2.Methods 2.2.1.Filtration of the Ginger Extract Ginger roots were thoroughly washed and dried at room temperature.After drying, the ginger was peeled and cut into small pieces.Ginger juice was extracted by passing ginger pieces through an electric juicer.Thick ginger juice was obtained, which was further puriﬁed using vacuum ﬁltration, as shown in Figure 1.Ginger juice was passed through 0.45µm and 0.22 µm pore-size ﬁlter papers consecutively to separate the coarser particles, and a transparent ginger extract was obtained, as shown in Figure 1b.Several trials were conducted to preserve the GE after ﬁltration, and it was found that after 24 h, the GE slowly started to lose its transparency and became turbid in 2–3 days.GE was preserved at different temperatures, and sonication was used to avoid aggregation.
It was observed that GE did not change in appearance and was reusable after sonication for almost a week when kept in an airtight bottle in a cold, dark place. However, the solutions were used within 12 h after ﬁltration.Membranes 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 16 and soluble in water.PEO is an FDA-approv ed nontoxic and non-immunogenic polymer, which makes it biocompatible and human-friendly [53].These attributes and the easy spinnability of PEO are reasons for the widespread use of PEO nanofibres in the biomed-ical and pharmaceutical fields [54–56].This study combines ginger and PEO to produce nanomembranes for potential ap- plications as a wound dressing.The impact of polymer concentration and ginger content were rheologically investigated and correlate d with the production of nanofibre-based membranes.Agar qualitative and quantitative tests confirmed the na no fibres’ antibacte- rial activity.2.Materials & Methods 2.1.

The wire was soaked with PEO/GE solution in a closed carriage with a carriage speed of 50 mm/s.

The dynamic viscosity, storage modulus, loss modulus, and tan delta are then plotted against shear frequency. 3.3.Attenuated Total Reﬂectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) Chemical analysis of PEO powder and PEO/GE nanoﬁbres was carried out using the Bruker FTIR spectrometer (Alpha-E).The ATR-FTIR with Diamond (Platinum) crystal provides high quality spectral database for precise material veriﬁcation and identiﬁca- tion.IR spectra of PEO powder and PEO/GE nanoﬁbres were scanned over a range of 500 to 4000 cm−1.3.4.Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) A Hitachi S-3500-SEM was used to investigate the ﬁbre morphology of PEO/GE nanoﬁbres.Sputter coating of samples was done with gold particles.SEM images were taken at 20 keV with a magniﬁcation of 10,000 ×.The ImageJ software was used to measure the average diameter of the PEO/GE nanoﬁbres from the SEM micrographs.An average of 100 ﬁbres’ diameter was taken from each micrograph.3.5.
Agar Disc Diffusion Test Agar disc diffusion and dilution tests were used for qualitative analysis of the PEO/GE nanoﬁbres’ antibacterial resistance and ability to prevent bacterial growth. Muller-Hinton agar plates were prepared with tryptone soya agar (TSA), and the strains of cultured Staphylococcus Aureus were spread uniformly with a swab on the plate.PEO/GE nanoﬁbre disks of 15 mm in diameter with different concentrations of ginger extract (10%, 20%, and 30%) were placed on prepared agar plates and then incubated at 37◦C for 24 h.After the incubation period, the plates were investigated for bacterial growth and the appearance of inhibition zones.3.6.Agar Dilution Test The agar dilution test was performed to quantify the antibacterial activity of PEO/GE nanoﬁbres.Staphylococcus aureus was grown in a liquid agar medium.PEO/GE Extract nanoﬁbres swatches were placed in the ﬂasks with 50 mL nutrient agar, and samples were incubated in a shaker at 37◦C.
After 24 h, solutions from ﬂasks were placed on a nutrient agar plate and incubated at 37◦C for 24 h. The number of surviving bacterial colonies was counted immediately after inoculation and after 24 h incubation to calculate the percentage of bacterial reduction using the following formula.Percentage Reduction =(A−B) A×100CFU (Colony Forming Units ) A= Number of bacteria recovered from the inoculated test sample immediately after contact.B= Number of bacteria recovered from the inoculated test sample incubated over 24 h period.4.Results & Discussion 4.1.Particle Size Analysis In Figure 3, the size distribution graph of ﬁltered GE indicates that the maximum nanoparticles lie between 5–300 d.nm.Almost 64.6% of particles have an average size of 140.2 d.nm, and 35.4% have 7.265 d.nm.Also, more than 25% of the 64.6% of larger particles have a size of less than 100 nm.These particles can be combined with nanoﬁbres at the nanoscale.
Also, the overall average particle size of GE is 91.16 d.nm which indicates its potential incorporation in nanoﬁbres with a diameter greater than 150 nm. Particle size also affects antibacterial activity.Smaller particle sizes enhance the effect because of Membranes 2022 ,12, 1148 6 of 15 the large surface area and high rate of reactivity [ 59].Although vacuum ﬁltration had only been used as a post-treatment for puriﬁcation of extracts, the results show it can be independently used as an extraction technique.It is cheap and straightforward, yet an effective and innovative method.Membranes 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 16 4.1.Particle Size Analysis In Figure 3, the size distribution graph of filtered GE indicates that the maximum nanoparticles lie between 5–300 d.nm.Almost 64.6% of particles have an average size of 140.2 d.nm, and 35.4% have 7.265 d.nm.Also, more than 25% of the 64.6% of larger parti- cles have a size of less than 100 nm.

The peaks at 2876 cm−1, 1463 cm−1, and 1345 cm−1 can be assigned to C-H stretching of the methylene group and C- H bending, respectively. The relatively sharp peaks at 1090 cm−1, 957 cm−1, and 835 cm−1 correspond to C-O-C vibration and the asymmetric motion of CH 2 [60,61].Figure 3.Size distribution analysis of GE.4.2.Chemical Group Analysis of Nanoﬁbres Figure 4 shows the FTIR spectra of PEO powder and PEO 5%GE30%nanoﬁbres to examine the functional groups of GE and PEO.The band at 3450 to 3181 cm−1in the red IR spectrum of PEO powder is due to the O-H stretching vibration.The peaks at 2876 cm−1, 1463 cm−1, and 1345 cm−1can be assigned to C-H stretching of the methylene group and C-H bending, respectively.The relatively sharp peaks at 1090 cm−1, 957 cm−1, and 835 cm−1correspond to C-O-C vibration and the asymmetric motion of CH 2[60,61].Membranes 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 16 Figure 4.FTIR spectrum of PEO powder (red ) and PEO/GE (blue) nanomembranes .
In the blue curve, signifying PEO 5%GE 30%, there is the appearance of some visible peaks at 3377 cm−1, 2920 cm−1, 2852 cm−1, and 1617 cm−1. Carbohydrates (50–70%), lipids (3–8%), terpenes, and phenolic compounds are some of the major constituents of ginger.ginger’s phenolic compounds, including gingerol, paradols, and shogaol, are mainly re-sponsible for the antibacterial activity of Ginger [62,63].The broad peak at 3370 cm −1 cor- responds to the O-H stretching and can be as signed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between PEO and these phenolic groups (e .g., 6-gingerol).The peaks at 2920 cm−1 and 2852 cm−1 represent the C-H and O-H stretching of the alkyl and carboxylic acid groups, re- spectively.The peak at 1617 cm−1 is attributed to the C=C stretching in the aromatic ring [64].4.3.Rheological Properties 4.3.1.
Viscoelastic Behaviour of PEO/GE Solutions at Different PEO Concentrations The viscoelastic properties of polymeric solutions depend on chain configuration, molecular weight, concentration, temperature, the nature of the solvent, and shear rate [65–68]. In this study, the concentration dependent viscoelastic behaviour of PEO/GE so- lutions was investigated by a frequency sweep test.It also has implications for solution electrospinnabilty and, ultimately, the morphology of nanofibres [69,70].Figure 5 shows the dynamic viscosity, storage modulus, loss modulus, and tan delta of PEO/GE solutions with varying PEO concentrations while keep ing the GE concentration constant at 10%.The viscosity of PEO 3% GE 10% remains constant as shear rate increases, exhibiting Newto- nian behaviour.This trend is because of the low PEO 3% GE 10% concentration, where vis- cosity is associated with indi vidual polymer chains.
The PEO 4% GE 10% and PEO 5% GE 10% viscosities increase significantly with increasing PEO concentration, indicating that enough chains of PEO enable entanglement formation, leading to larger chain structures. Figure 4.FTIR spectrum of PEO powder (red) and PEO/GE (blue) nanomembranes.Membranes 2022 ,12, 1148 7 of 15 In the blue curve, signifying PEO 5%GE30%, there is the appearance of some visible peaks at 3377 cm−1, 2920 cm−1, 2852 cm−1, and 1617 cm−1.Carbohydrates (50–70%), lipids (3–8%), terpenes, and phenolic compounds are some of the major constituents of ginger.ginger’s phenolic compounds, including gingerol, paradols, and shogaol, are mainly responsible for the antibacterial activity of Ginger [ 62,63].The broad peak at 3370 cm−1corresponds to the O-H stretching and can be assigned to the formation of hydrogen bonds between PEO and these phenolic groups (e.g., 6-gingerol).
The peaks at 2920 cm−1and 2852 cm−1represent the C-H and O-H stretching of the alkyl and carboxylic acid groups, respectively. The peak at 1617 cm−1is attributed to the C=C stretching in the aromatic ring [64].4.3.Rheological Properties 4.3.1.Viscoelastic Behaviour of PEO/GE Solutions at Different PEO Concentrations The viscoelastic properties of polymeric solutions depend on chain configuration, molec- ular weight, concentration, temperature, the nature of the solvent, and shear rate [ 65–68].In this study , the concentration dependent viscoelastic behaviour of PEO/GE solutions was investigated by a frequency sweep test.It also has implications for solution electrospinnabilty and, ultimately , the morphology of nanofibres [ 69,70].Figure 5 shows the dynamic viscos- ity , storage modulus, loss modulus, and tan delta of PEO/GE solutions with varying PEO concentrations while keeping the GE concentration constant at 10%.
The viscosity of PEO 3% GE10%remains constant as shear rate increases, exhibiting Newtonian behaviour. This trend is because of the low PEO 3%GE10%concentration, where viscosity is associated with individual polymer chains.The PEO 4%GE10%and PEO 5%GE10%viscosities increase significantly with increasing PEO concentration, indicating that enough chains of PEO enable entanglement for- mation, leading to larger chain structures.This is because of the longer chain structure of PEO (higher molecular weight), which caused chain entanglements even at 4 wt%.Consequently , the viscosity increases exponentially with increasing concentration at 4 and 5 wt%.Both the PEO 4%GE10%and PEO 5%GE10%curves follow the shear thinning behaviour.In the first quarter, both solutions show a constant decrease in their dynamic viscosity because the chain disruption is low at lower shear rates and coils re-entangle instantaneously .
The transition to shear thinning started at a lower frequency in the PEO 5%GE10%solution because of higher chain entanglements than in PEO 4%GE10%. Then the shear thinning behaviour dominates with increasing shear rates because the rate of chain disruption exceeds the rate of re-coiling.The dynamic viscoelastic parameters Loss Modulus G′′, Storage Modulus G′, and Tangent Delta (Tan δ) for 3, 4, and 5 wt% PEO at room temperature are presented as a function of shear rate in Figure 5b–d, respectively.Storage modulus highlights the elastic part, while loss modulus indicates the viscous part of the non-Newtonian solution.Tangent delta, the ratio of loss to storage modulus, signiﬁes the energy absorption behaviour of a material.Tangent delta values less than 1 imply that the material is inclined towards a viscous nature, while values higher than 1 indicate an elastic nature.
The Tan δof the PEO 3% GE10%solution is signiﬁcantly higher than 1 over the frequency range examined, which is an indication that the loss modulus of the solution is greater than that of the storage modulus. In other words, the viscous nature dominates over the elastic nature of a PEO 3% GE10%solution.This is because of the lower concentration, where individual chains resist the change in their structure and result in the ﬂow.However, as the shear rate increase, the Tan δdecreases, indicating that the PEO 3%GE10%solution has reached the terminal region of viscoelasticity and exhibits dominated viscous behaviour.In the terminal region, rearrangements and slippage of polymer molecules relative to each other are observed.The PEO 3%GE10%solution with the lowest PEO concentration has more space in the sol- vent to move freely with little chance of entanglements causing it to ﬂow almost like a Newtonian ﬂuid.
PEO 4%GE10%and PEO 5%GE10%also have Tan δover 1 at the start, and then both decrease with increasing shear rate. However, the Tan δof both solutions has signiﬁcantly lesser values than the PEO 3%GE10%solution.Due to the higher PEO concen- tration, both G′and G′′increases with increasing shear rate.However, the elastic modulus Membranes 2022 ,12, 1148 8 of 15 dominates with increasing shear rate, resulting in a lesser Tan δvalue and reaching 1 around 30~40 rad/s for almost both solutions of PEO 4%GE10%and PEO 5%GE10%.This is known as the gel point, where the loss and elastic modulus are equal.The elastic modulus dominates with increasing shear rates, and the Tan δreduces from 1, indicating an elastic solution at higher shear rates.This can be explained based on a higher concentration of PEO with a longer chain structure, resulting in polymer chain interpenetration under the inﬂuence of shear force.
The elastic behaviour of a solution depends on the formation of chain entanglements at different contacts that polymer coils make. Higher shear force promotes the chain entanglement points, resulting in increased elastic behaviour.Also, it is natural that a higher shear rate results in higher elastic responses.Membranes 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 16 This is because of the longer chain structure of PEO (higher molecular weight), which caused chain entanglements even at 4 wt%.Consequently, the viscosity increases expo- nentially with increasing concentration at 4 and 5 wt%.Both the PEO 4% GE 10% and PEO 5% GE 10% curves follow the shear thinning behaviour.In the first quarter, both solutions show a constant decrease in their dynamic viscosity because the chain disruption is low at lower shear rates and coils re-entangle instantaneousl y.

Then the shear thinning behaviou r dominates with increasing shear rates because the rate of chain disrup tion exceeds the rate of re-coiling.Figure 5.(a) Dynamic viscosity, ( b) Loss modulus, ( c) Storage modulus, and ( d) Tangent delta of PEO/GE nanofibres (PEO 3%, 4%, 5% GE 10%).The dynamic viscoelastic parameters Loss Modulus G ″, Storage Modulus G ′, and Tangent Delta (Tan δ) for 3, 4, and 5 wt% PEO at room temperature are presented as a function of shear rate in Figures 5b, 5c, and 5d, respectively.Storage modulus highlights the elastic part, while loss modulus indicates the viscous part of the non-Newtonian solu- tion.Tangent delta, the ratio of loss to stor age modulus, signifies the energy absorption behaviour of a material.
Tangent delta values less than 1 imply that the material is inclined towards a viscous nature, while values higher than 1 indicate an elastic nature. The Tan δ of the PEO 3% GE 10% solution is significantly higher than 1 over the frequency range exam- ined, which is an indication that the loss modu lus of the solution is greater than that of the storage modulus.In other words, the visc ous nature dominates over the elastic nature Figure 5.(a) Dynamic viscosity, ( b) Loss modulus, ( c) Storage modulus, and ( d) Tangent delta of PEO/GE nanoﬁbres (PEO 3%, 4%, 5% GE10%).4.3.2.Viscoelastic Behaviour of PEO/GE Solutions at Different GE Concentrations GE concentration can also affect the rheological behaviour of PEO/GE solutions, as rheological properties critically depend on the solvent polymer interactions.Water is a good solvent for PEO due to its higher polarity, and PEO molecules interact favourably with water.
Dynamic viscosity, loss modulus, storage modulus, and Tan δfor solutions with a constant PEO concentration (5%) and varying GE concentration (10%, 20%, and 30%) are shown in Figure 6a–d. Increasing the GE concentration on solutions’ viscoelastic behaviour is not as drastic as varying PEO concentrations.However, the dynamic viscosity increases with increasing GE concentration in the solution.This can be explained by the polar Membranes 2022 ,12, 1148 9 of 15 interactions between PEO and active compounds of GE like 6-gingerol.Figure 7 shows the schematic diagram of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PEO and 6-gingerol.Two possible reasons can explain the increasing viscosity behaviour.Firstly, a higher GE concentration might offer more hydrogen bonds to PEO, resulting in resisting ﬂow and a higher viscosity.
The second reason might be the larger size of 6-gingerol and other compound molecules in GE than the water molecules, resulting in swelling of the PEO chains with increasing GE concentration and higher viscosity. In addition, all three PEO/GE solutions follow shear thinning behaviour, indicating that the coil dimensions changed similarly for all solutions with varying GE concentrations.The Tan δcurve decreases with increasing GE concentration.These results align with the viscosity response, where more polymer and solvent interactions increase with GE concentration.Membranes 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 16 Figure 6.Dynamic viscosity, loss modulus, storage modulus, and tangent delta of PEO/GE nano- fibres (PEO 5% GE 10%, 20%, 30% ).Figure 7.Schematic representation of hydrogen bonding between PEO and 6-Gingerol .4.4.

Figure 8 shows the SEM images and histograms of PEO/GE nanoﬁbres electrospun at different PEO concentrations but under the same spinning conditions. SEM images indicate bead-less nanoﬁbres with smooth morphology at all three PEO concentra- tions of 3, 4, and 5 wt%.Further, as PEO concentration increases, so does the average ﬁbre diameter.The average nanoﬁbre diameter of PEO 3%GE10%,PEO 4%GE10%,and PEO5 %GE10% is 242 nm, 269.3 nm, and 339.6 nm, respectively.This trend can be explained by increasing viscosity as PEO concentration increases.Solution viscosity has a direct impact on the nanoﬁbres’ morphology.Large-diameter ﬁbres form with a higher solution viscosity, and the diameter decreases with a reduced PEO concentration due to the reduced solution viscosity.As discussed previously, increasing the PEO concentration enhances chain entan- glements, leading to higher viscosity.
The chain entanglements form better elastic forces to resist stretching by electrostatic forces, resulting in nanoﬁbres with a larger diameter and vice versa.

Conclusions Polyethylene oxide-based antibacterial nano webs containing ginger extract were suc- cessfully fabricated as a function of PEO an d GE concentrations. The effects of PEO and GE concentrations were investigated through rheological studies.The GE was obtained after vacuum filtration with an average particle size of 91.16 d.nm.The GE was incorpo-rated in PEO solutions and fabricated by needleless electrospinning.Rheological analysis showed that the 3 wt% PEO showed Newtonian behaviour, as the viscosity did not change with shear rate.However, 4 and 5 wt% PEO showed shear thinning behaviour, resulting in Non-Newtonian fluids.Additionally, the dynamic viscosity increased with increasing the GE concentration.In addition, Tan δ decreased with increasing PEO concentrations and shear rates.Tan δ also reduced with increasing th e GE concentration.However, the extent of Tan δ depreciation was larger with an increase in the PEO concentration than with increasing GE concentration.
FTIR result s validated the presence of GE in nanofibres as several peaks corresponding to GE chemic al groups appeared in PEO/GE nanofibres. According to the SEM results, larger PEO/GE nanofibres with a higher PEO concentration produced fine nanofibres with a larger diameter (339.6 nm).In vitro agar diffusion and agar dilution results suggested promising antibacterial properties.The PEO nanofibres with 30% GE had a 2 mm inhibition zone and a reduction of 98.79%.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.K.; Formal anal ysis, M.J., A.A.(Adnan Ahmad) and A.N.S.; Funding acquisition, S.A.A.and F.A.H.; In vestigation, R.S.and M.B.Q.; Project administra- tion, M.B.Q.; Resources, M.J., M.Faisal and S.A.A.; Software, A.J., A.A.(Aiman Ali) and F.A.H.; Figure 10.Bacterial colonies immediately after inoculation and after 24 h incubation of ( a,a′) PEO 5% GE30%, (b,b′) PEO 5%GE20%, and ( c,c′) PEO 5%GE10%.Membranes 2022 ,12, 1148 12 of 15 Table 4.Bacterial reduction of the PEO/GE nanomembrane.
