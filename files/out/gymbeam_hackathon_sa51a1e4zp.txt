Box 338,, 6708 WD Wageningen, The Netherlands ABSTRACT Background: Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) regulates body phosphate homeostasis primarily by increasing phosphaturia. It alsoacts as a vitamin D-regulating hormone.Maternal iron deficiency is associatedwithperturbedexpressionand/orregulationofFGF23and hencemightbeimplicatedinthepathogenesisofhypophosphatemia-driven rickets in their offspring.Objectives: We aimed to determine the effect of antenatal oral iron supplementation on FGF23 concentration and maternal and infantmarkers of bone-mineral regulation.Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of a trial in which 470ruralKenyanwomenwithsingletonpregnanciesandhemoglobinconcentrations ≥90g/Lwererandomlyallocatedtodaily,supervised supplementation with 60 mg elemental iron as ferrous fumarate or placebo from 13–23 weeks of gestation until 1 mo postpartum.As previously reported, iron supplementation improved iron status in mothers and neonates.
For the present study, we reanalyzed all available plasmasamplescollected inmothersand neonates atbirth,with primary outcomes being concentrations of FGF23, measured by 2 assays: 1 that detects intact hormone and C-terminal cleavage products (total-FGF23) and another that detects the intact hormone only (intact-FGF23). Results: Analysis was performed on 433 women ( n=216, iron group;n=217, placebo group) and 414 neonates ( n=207, iron group;n=207, placebo group).Antenatal iron supplementation reducedgeometricmeantotal-FGF23concentrationsinmothersandneonates by 62.6% (95% CI: 53.0%, 70.3%) and 15.2% (95% CI: −0.3%, 28.4%, P=0.06), respectively.In addition, it increased geometric mean neonatal intact-FGF23 concentrations by 21.6%(95%CI:1.2%,46.1%),increasedgeometricmeanmaternalhepcidinconcentrations by 136.4% (95% CI: 86.1%, 200.3%), and decreased mean maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations by 6.1 nmol/L (95% CI: −11.0,−1.2 nmol/L).
Conclusions: Analysis of this randomized trial confirms that iron supplementation can reverse elevated FGF23 production caused by iron deficiency in iron-deficient mothers and their neonates.Further investigations are warranted to assess to what extent iron supplementation can prevent FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemic rickets or osteomalacia. AmJClinNutr 2021;113:1104–1114.Keywords: iron deficiency anemia, fibroblast growth factor (FGF23), phosphate, vitamin D, bone, Africa, pregnancy Introduction There is increasing evidence that iron deficiency in children with chronically inadequate calcium intake may predispose torickets, one of the most common noncommunicable childhood diseases in developing countries ( 1).In this pathogenic pathway (Figure 1), there seems to be a central role for fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), a key regulator of circulating concentrations of phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH) 2D— the bioactive form of vitamin D] ( 2).
In vitamin D-replete Gambian children, rickets was associated with elevated plasma concentrations of total-FGF23 (as measured by an assay which detects both the intact hormone and the C-terminal fragmentsthat result from its cleavage), 1,25(OH) 2D, and total alkaline phosphatase (a marker of dysregulated bone formation that is elevated in rickets and osteomalacia) and with lower plasma 1104 AmJClinNutr 2021;113:1104–1114.

Effect of oral antenatal iron on FGF23 and bone 1105 concentrationsofphosphate( 3).Gambianchildrenwithahistory of rickets-like bone deformities had a higher prevalence of anemiathancommunitycontrols,andtotal-FGF23concentration was negatively associated with hemoglobin concentration ( 4). In an iron supplementation study among Gambian children, plasma total-FGF23 concentration at baseline was inversely associated with markers of iron (plasma ferritin concentration,hemoglobin concentration), whereas at 3 mo after the start of iron supplementation, plasma total-FGF23 concentrations were lower than at the start of the intervention ( 5).As with most such studies, ethics constraints precluded the use of a placebo control group.
In a prospective cohort study, Gambian children born to mothers who were iron deficient during pregnancyhad higher concentrations of total-FGF23 and total alkaline phosphatase than those whose mothers had normal iron status and this difference persisted ≤2yo fa g e( 6). In mice, diet- induced iron deficiency during pregnancy and nursing resulted in elevated serum concentrations of total-FGF23 and intact- FGF23(asmeasuredusinganassaywhichonlydetectstheintacthormone),hypophosphatemia,andreducedserumconcentrations of 1,25(OH) 2D in their pups ( 7).These data suggest that maternal iron deficiency may lead to perturbations in FGF23regulation that may in turn lead to hypophosphatemia-driven rickets in the offspring.In addition, maternal bone mineral density decreases by 3%–5% during pregnancy and lactation(8).
This physiological change, coupled with iron-deficiency phosphate loss, may put additional pressures on the maternal skeleton, thus predisposing iron-deficient women to poor bonehealth in later life.

The requirement for iron and the demands on the kidney increase during pregnancy, and the risk of developing iron deficiencyand/oranemiaincreasessubstantially.Ironabsorptionand thus the effect of iron interventions on systemic biomarkers (e.g., hemoglobin concentration) are known to depend on iron status.This process is mediated by circulating concentrationsof hepcidin, the master regulator of body iron homeostasis.Causality of the relations between iron deficiency and bone metabolism has not yet been shown, because evidence has so farbeenobtainedexclusivelyfromobservationalstudiesandanimal studies.
Such an effect would be pertinent to developing coun- tries,whereirondeficiencyoftenaffectsthemajorityofpregnantwomen and a substantial proportion of young children ( 11). The aim of this current study was to investigate the effect of antenataloralironsupplementationoncirculatingconcentrationsof FGF23 and hence on markers of phosphate and bone metabolism (including vitamin D) and kidney function at birth in pregnant Kenyan women and their offspring.In addition,we explored to what extent the response of these markers to intervention depended on initial iron status.Methods Study design, participants, randomization, and blinding The present study used samples and data that were collected as part of a randomized placebo-controlled trial in rural Kenya (NCT01308112) originally designed to measure the effect of antenatal iron supplementation on maternal Plasmodium infection risk, maternal iron status, and neonatal outcomes.
The recruitment for the original trial was conducted between 2011 and 2013. Study details and main results have beenpublished elsewhere ( 12).In brief, pregnant women aged 15– 45 y with singleton pregnancies, gestational age of 13–23 wk (determined by obstetric ultrasonography), and hemoglobinconcentration ≥90 g/L were individually randomly assigned at a 1:1 allocation ratio to 60 mg of elemental iron as ferrous fumarate or placebo until 1 mo postpartum.The supplementscontained no other micronutrients and their neonates did not receive any additional supplements.From screening until the end of the intervention, local mill operators added fortificantiron (target dose: 20 mg/kg flour) to grain routinely brought for milling by homestead members of all the participating women.Based on weighed intake studies, we estimate thatfortification supplied on average 5.7 mg of elemental iron as ferric sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate daily to the pregnant women in both arms of the intervention.
Participants and fieldstaffwereblindedtotherandomizationandinterventionuntildata analysis. All women provided written informed consent.Approval for the original study was obtained from ethics committees at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom, and the Kenyatta National Hospital/University of 1106 Braithwaite et al.FIGURE 1 Putative mechanisms whereby deficiencies of iron and calcium lead to hypophosphatemia and rickets.FGF23 is a hormone that is mainly secreted by osteocytes in response to elevated concentrations of 1,25(OH) 2D.FGF23 causes the internalization of sodium phosphate cotransporters in the proximal tubule of the kidney, inhibiting 1- α-hydroxylase [which catalyzes the hydroxylation of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH) 2D] and stimulating expression of 24- hydroxylase [which initiates the degradation of 1,25(OH) 2D to an inactive form of vitamin D].
The net effect is an increased phosphate loss in the urine, an accompanying reduction in circulating phosphate concentration, and a decrease in 1,25(OH) 2D. Iron deficiency probably stimulates FGF23 gene expression by activating HIF-1 ( 7,13), the master transcriptional regulator of cellular and developmental responses to hypoxia.Iron deficiency also increases renal EPO production.EPO mediates the relation between HIF-1 and FGF23 resulting in further increases in FGF23 gene expression ( 14).In osteocytes, a proportion of FGF23 is normally broken down by proteolytic cleavage before secretion, resulting in both intact, biologically active hormone and C-terminal and N- terminal fragments (with unclear biological activity) in the circulation ( 15).
Some studies in healthy adults have indicated that low serum iron was associated with elevated total-FGF23 but not intact-FGF23, suggesting that cleavage maintains phosphate homeostasis despite increased FGF23 expression ( 15,16), whereas others have shown that low serum iron is associated with elevated total- and intact-FGF23 ( 17,18).

Procedures Maternal weight and height were measured at baseline, and neonatal weight, length, and head circumference were measuredat birth. At baseline, we collected venous blood samples in EDTA-coated tubes from women.We also collected maternal venousblood,neonatalcordblood,andplacentalbiopsieswithin1 h postpartum.For home deliveries, samples were collected within 2 h postpartum.Plasma was stored within 2 h of blood collection in liquid nitrogen ( −196 ◦C) and subsequently frozen ( −80◦C) until analysis.
We performed ELISA tests at the Medical Research Council Elsie Widdowson Laboratory, Cambridge,United Kingdom to measure the following markers in plasma Effect of oral antenatal iron on FGF23 and bone 1107 collected at delivery: total-FGF23 using the C-terminal assay (60-6100) which detects both the C-terminal fragment and the intact hormone, and intact-FGF23 using the intact-FGF23 assay (60-6600) which detects only the intact form of the hormone(Immutopics); 1,25(OH) 2D (the active metabolite of vitamin D; Immunodiagnostic Systems); β-C-terminal telopeptide ( β- Crosslaps—a marker of bone resorption that is elevated inincreased bone resorption; Immunodiagnostic Systems); and hepcidin (a regulator of iron metabolism that is low in iron deficiency and raised by inflammation; Hepcidin-25, Bioac-tive).
Hemoglobin concentration was measured in the field by photometer (HemoCue 301, Radiometer) and plasma α 1-acid glycoprotein (a marker of inflammation) and soluble transferrinreceptor (sTfR—a marker of iron status) were measured at MeanderMedicalCentre,Amersfoort,Netherlands(UniCelDxC 880ianalyzer,BeckmanCoulter)aspartoftheoriginaltrial( 12). Plasma concentrations of ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP— a marker of inflammation), 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D— marker of vitamin D status], total alkaline phosphatase, intactparathyroid hormone (PTH—a primary regulatory hormone of calcium that is elevated in calcium deficiency), cystatin C (a marker that is elevated in kidney dysfunction), and phos-phate were measured at Meander Medical Centre, Amersfoort, Netherlands (Architect c16000 and Architect i2000SR, Abbott).ELISA assay accuracy was monitored across the working rangeof assays using kit controls supplied by the manufacturers.
The UK laboratory was accredited by the Vitamin D External QualityAssessmentScheme( http://www.deqas.org/ )andtheUK National External Quality Assessment Service ( https://ukneqas. org.uk/) and the laboratory in the Netherlands by the External Quality Assurance System ( https://www.eurl-ar.eu/eqas.aspx ) and German Society for Clinical Chemistry and LaboratoryMedicine (DGKL) ( https://www.dgkl.de/en/ ).In addition, an aliquot of a pooled plasma sample was assayed in each batch to monitor possible drift in measurements over time.Intra- andinterassay CVs were <7% and <6% for total-FGF23, intact- FGF23, β-Crosslaps,1,25(OH) 2D,25(OH)D,PTH,ferritin,CRP, phosphate, total alkaline phosphatase, and cystatin C and <5% and<17% for hepcidin, respectively.
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR—a measure of kidney glomerular function) was calculated using equationsapproved by the National Kidney Foundation ( https://www.kidn ey.org/professionals/KDOQI/gfr )—the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) cystatin C equationsfor those aged >18 y: eGFR, mL ·min −1·1.73 m−2=123.9 ×[cystatin C (mg/L)/0.8]−1.328×0.996ageand for those aged ≤18 y: eGFR, mL ·min−1·1.73 m−2=70.69 ×[cystatin C (mg/L)]−0.931. At baseline, dipstick tests (Access Bio) were used to detect histidine-rich protein-2 and lactate dehydrogenase specific either to P.falciparum or to nonfalciparum human Plas- modiumspecies (12).qPCR was used to detect P.falciparum– specific DNA in erythrocytes, and mothers were also tested for HIV infection.HIV-infected mothers continued or wereoffered antiretroviral treatment as part of their standard clinical care.
Outcomes The primary analysis concerned group differences in plasma concentrations of total-FGF23 and intact-FGF23 in maternalblood samples at delivery and neonatal cord blood samples. As secondary outcomes, we studied other biomarkers of bone metabolism and kidney function, namely, plasma concentrations of phosphate, PTH, total alkaline phosphatase, β-Crosslaps, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2D, cystatin C, and eGFR.Statistical analysis Sample size requirements were calculated based on the effect of iron supplementation on Plasmodium infection risk ( 12)a s part of the original trial design; because they are not relevant to the current study, they are not reported here.The current studyperformedanalysisonallavailableplasmasamplesfrommothers at birth (n=433) and from infant cord blood ( n=414) at delivery.Anthropometric zscores for the neonates at birth were derived with Kenyan children as a reference ( 19).
The following definitions were used: prematurity–being born at or before37 completed weeks of gestation ( <259 days of gestation as calculated by early pregnancy ultrasound); anemia: hemoglobin concentration <110 g/L for pregnant women ( 19); iron defi- ciency (depleted iron stores)–plasma ferritin concentration <15 μg/Lforwomenand <12μg/Lforneonates( 20);inflammation– plasmaCRP >10mg/L( 21);vitaminDinsufficiency–25(OH)D concentration <50 nmol/L; and vitamin D deficiency–25(OH)D concentration <30 nmol/L ( 22). There are no established thresholdsforintact-FGF23ortotal-FGF23concentrationsorforeGFR in pregnancy and neonates, orfor anemia in neonates, and so these variables were not dichotomized.Plasmodium infection was defined as past or present maternal infection assessed atparturition,regardlessofspecies,asindicatedby ≥1positivetest results for the presence of Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase orP.
falciparum– specific histidine-rich protein-2 in plasma or by placental histopathology or P. falciparum DNA in maternal erythrocytes from venous or placental blood by a PCR test.Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 16.0 (StataCorp).Wevisuallyinspectedhistogramstoassesstheshape of the distribution and to identify possible outliers.Skewed data were normalized by log transformation as appropriate.Groupswere described using mean ±SD for normally distributed data andgeometricmean ±geometricSD(GSD)forlog-transformed data.GSD was calculated as the exponentiated SD of the log-transformed variable.It is a dimensionless factor that indicates variationthatisequivalenttosubtractionoradditionof1SDona log-transformedscale.ForplasmaCRPconcentrationatbaseline,we computeddescriptive statistics with a Tobitmodelto account fordatabeingleft-censoredatthelimitofquantification(1mg/L).
Plasma concentrations of ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) are affected by infection and inflammation independentlyofironstatus.Weusedmultipleregressionmodels to adjust the iron markers for such effects ( Supplemental Methods). We used adjusted plasma iron markers to calculate thebodyironindex,i.e.,thelnoftheratiooftheadjustedferritin concentration to the adjusted sTfR concentration.This indicatorhas been shown to be linearly associated with quantitative estimates of the size of the body iron store in iron-replete adults, and with the size of the functional deficit that would need to becorrected before iron could again be accumulated in the store in iron-deficient individuals ( 23).1108 Braithwaite et al.Crude intervention effects on continuous outcomes were estimated by simple linear regression.
To assess the potential role of confounding due to imbalances in baseline variables, we used multiple fractional polynomial regression to estimateintervention effects adjusted for maternal characteristics as- sessed at randomization, i.e., hemoglobin concentration, body iron index, age, BMI, gestational age at delivery (calculatedfrom early pregnancy ultrasonography), parity, HIV infection, andPlasmodium infection. Both in simple linear regression models and in fractional polynomial models, we accounted forheteroscedasticity of the error terms as appropriate ( Pvalues for Breusch–Pagan/Cook–Weisberg tests <0.05).Intervention effectsarereportedasabsolutedifferencesinmeansfornormallydistributed outcomes, or as relative differences in geometric means for log-transformed outcomes.For unadjusted prevalence differences, we used Newcombe’s method to estimate 95% CIs and “N −1” chi-square tests to compute Pvalues (24).
We used log-binomial regression models(adjrrcommandinStatapackage st0306.pkg )toestimate prevalence differences adjusted for baseline characteristics, and to estimate unadjusted prevalence differences when contingency tables contained cells with expected values <10. In a preplanned analysis, we used multiple fractional poly- nomial regression analysis to explore to what extent iron status at baseline modified the magnitude of the effect ofiron supplementation on FGF23 and selected markers of bone metabolism at delivery, anticipating that iron absorption and thus the response to administered iron would be larger in iron-deficient women than in their iron-replete peers.
We examinedsucheffectmodificationwithasingleindependentvariable(body iron index) and 10 outcomes (see the Outcomes section), in both mothersandneonates,whichresultedin20analyses.Weusedthemfpiprocedure in Stata with the “ flex(3)” specification to define the flexibility of the main effects and interaction models with adjustment for potentially influential maternal characteristicsassessed at randomization, i.e., hemoglobin concentration, BMI, gestationalage,parity,HIVinfection,and Plasmodium infection. We used a nominal significance level of 0.05 for selection ofvariables and power functions; selection of linear, first-degree, or second-degree polynomials was based on the lowest value for Akaike’s information criterion.To check for possible overfittingin the interaction models, we examined to what extent possible trends in intervention effects observed across quintiles of body iron index were consistent with effect modification as measuredby fractional polynomial regression.
Results Primary outcome data were available for 433 women (92% of 470 women randomly assigned to the intervention). Samplesizes<433reportedinthesubsequentsectionswereduetoinsuf- ficient plasma volume being available for biochemical analysis (Figure 2).Maternal and neonatal biomarkers At baseline, women had a mean age of 25.1 y, 16.2% were nulliparous, 38.3% were anemic, 99.1% were iron deficient (plasma ferritin concentration <15 μg/L; values adjusted forinflammationand Plasmodium infection),34.4%hadacurrentor recentPlasmodium infection, and 21.7% were HIV-infected.At baseline,anthropometricindexes,ironstatus,andinfectionstatus were similar between intervention groups ( Table 1).Antenatal oral iron supplementation reduced the geometric mean maternal concentration of total-FGF23 (by −62.6%) and mean maternal concentration of 25(OH)D (by −6.1 nmol/L) (Table 2).
It also improved maternal iron status as shown by an increased geometric mean concentration of hepcidin (by 136.4%); increased mean concentration of hemoglobin (by 9.0g/L); increased geometric mean concentration of ferritin (by 95.6%);andareducedprevalenceofanemia(by29.1%)andiron deficiency (by 27.1%). Antenatal oral iron supplementation reduced the geometric meanneonataltotal-FGF23concentration(by15.2%),whereasit increased the geometric mean neonatal intact-FGF23 concentra-tion(by21.6%)( Table 2).Itimprovedneonatalironstores(mean ferritin concentration increased by 23.3%) ( Table 2) and other neonatal outcomes (birth weight, length at birth, and gestationalduration increased by 141 g, 0.9 cm, and 3.4 d, respectively) described in our previous publication ( 12).No marked group differences were seen in the other maternal orneonatalbiomarkersofbone,kidney,orvitaminDmetabolism.
As might be expected with a randomized trial of this size, adjustment of treatment effects for baseline variables that wereconsideredaprioritobeprognosticforoutcomedidnotmarkedly change effect estimates ( Supplemental Table 1 ), showing that effects are attributable to the intervention alone and not toselection bias. Influence of baseline variables on intervention effects Figure3showsintervention ×bodyironindexinteractionsfor selected outcomes.In women who received placebo (left panels, red lines), low iron status at baseline (as indicated by body iron indexvalues)wasassociatedwithhighermaternalconcentrationsof total-FGF23, intact-FGF23, and cystatin C, as well as lower neonatal intact-FGF23 concentration and lower maternal eGFR.
Consistent with these observations, we found that antenatal oraliron supplementation reduced maternal total-FGF23 concentra- tions (overall: by 62.6%) ( Table 2), with the magnitude of this effect being inversely associated with maternal iron status atbaseline( Figure3,secondrightpanel; P=0.004).Similarly,we foundthatantenataloralironsupplementationincreasedneonatal intact-FGF23 concentration, with the magnitude of the effectbeing inversely associated with maternal iron status at baseline (P=0.04).
For maternal intact-FGF23 concentration, maternal cystatin C concentration, and maternal eGFR, the effect of antenatal iron supplementation also varied by initial maternal iron status (Figure 3, right panels), but cumulative frequency distributions (Figure 3, left panels, gray lines) indicated that most women had body iron index values around the cutoffs that deter- mined whether the effect of intervention was either positiveor negative (intact-FGF23, eGFR) or body iron index values within the range of no effect (cystatin C). This may explain the absence of marked effects in the unadjusted analysis(Table 2; also indicated in Figure 3, right panels, dashed lines).Effect of oral antenatal iron on FGF23 and bone 1109 FIGURE 2 Flow-through of participants in the study and blood samples available for analysis.
Analysis of effect modification by body iron index quan- tiles showed similar patterns as aforementioned ( Supple- mental Figure 1 ), indicating that the results presented in Figure 3 are not the result of overfitting. There was no evidence for effect modification for the other outcomesconsidered.Discussion To our knowledge, we report the first randomized placebo- controlled trial to assess the effect of oral iron supplementationon FGF23 concentrations in persons without kidney disease.Antenatal iron supplementation reduced maternal total-FGF23 concentrations but not maternal intact-FGF23 concentrations 1110 Braithwaite et al.

Althoughthere was no measurable overall effect of iron supplementation on maternal intact-FGF23 concentration, maternal cystatin C concentration,andmaternaleGFR,wefoundthatinitialmaternaliron status may have influenced the direction and magnitude of these effects. Lastly, iron supplementation decreased maternal 25(OH)Dconcentration,buttherewasnoevidencethatthiseffectdepended on initial maternal iron status ( 12).The strengths of this study include its randomized design; largesamplesize;supervisedadministrationofsupplementswithexcellent adherence (iron: 100%; placebo: 99.1%) ( 12); blinding ofparticipants,fieldstaff,andlaboratorystafftotheintervention; the use of a placebo as a comparator; and the inclusion of iron-deficient and anemic women in the trial.One study limitation is that we assessed intervention effects on multiple endpoints, which has the inherent risk of multiplicity.On the otherhand, effects on related outcomes can be mutually reinforcing instead of undermining ( 25).
This point is underscored by our finding that iron supplementation led to increased maternalferritin concentrations ( Table 2), which lends credence to the concurrentincreaseinmaternalhemoglobinconcentrations:both findings indicate that the intervention improved maternal ironstatus. Results of the intervention ×baseline body iron index interactionsshouldbeinterpretedwithcautionandconsideredas exploratory because of the potential instability of the functionsfound, and because further studies are needed to validate thebody iron index, adjusted for inflammation and infection, as an indicator of body iron status.In addition, in light of the decreases in 25(OH)D concentrations and the known effects of ironsupplementsonintestinalcalciumabsorption,itislikelythatiron supplementation affects calcium metabolism.This finding could not be further investigated because blood samples were collected in EDTA-coated tubes which inhibits accurate calciummeasurement.
Plasma erythropoietin (EPO) concentration was not measured owing to constraints in available plasma volume and so could not be investigated in the causal pathway betweeniron supplementation and total-FGF23 reduction. An additional limitationisthatcertaincharacteristicsthatmayhaveaffectedthe outcome were not measured at baseline.However, with samplesizes>200/group, simple randomization normally yields only mild disparities in sample sizes between groups ( 26).Thus, it is unlikely that group imbalances in prognostic variables atbaseline led to substantial selection bias in our effect estimates.The marked reduction in maternal and neonatal total-FGF23 concentrationsafterantenatalironsupplementationisinkeepingwith previous studies ( 6,7) and is likely caused by a reversal of hypoxia and/or EPO-driven FGF23gene expression in osteocytes that occurs in iron deficiency ( 7).
Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the reduction in total-FGF23 was most pronounced in mothers with the lowest body iron status. Our findings corroborate emerging evidence that orally administered iron does not normally lead to measurable changes in maternal plasma concentrations of intact-FGF23 or phosphate(6).Iron deficiency results in increased concentrations of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α, which stimulates FGF23transcrip- tion through increased EPO production and perhaps also bydirectly binding to the FGF23promoter ( 15).

Effects are reported as absolute difference in means, relative difference (%) in geometric means, or difference in pre valence, with placebo as the reference group. Group estimates are medians [IQRs]; group differences in distributions were compared by independent-samples M ann–Whitney Utest, which yields a P value only.For continuous outcomes, Pvalues were obtained by simple linear regression analysis, accounting for heteroscedasticity.For binary outcomes, we used Newcombe’s method to estimate 95% CIs and “N −1” chi-square tests to compute Pvalues.We used log-binomial regression models to estimate prevalence differences when contingency tables contained cells with expected values <10.Pvalues indicate the probability of data occurring as observed or being more extreme than observed under the assumption of no effect, i.e., outcomes be ing identically distributed for groups that received supplementation with either placebo or iron.

Although hypophosphatemia due to single- dose administration of intravenous iron is often transient andasymptomatic, it can persist for >1 mo, and some patients developsevereandsymptomatichypophosphatemiawithserious musculoskeletal complications, including osteomalacia, fragilityfractures, and hypoxemia ( 28). In the present study, the effect of the iron intervention on maternal intact-FGF23 concentration varied with baselineiron status ( Figure 3), suggesting that FGF23transcription and cleavage are uncoupled in women with poor iron status.In our study, this occurred in ∼40% of women (the lowest 2 quintiles; see Supplemental Figure 1).Chronically elevated concentrations of intact-FGF23 result in phosphaturia and eventually hypophosphatemia, which in turn can lead to seriousmusculoskeletal complications, including rickets in children and osteomalacia fragility fractures in adults.
However, overall we found no evidence that iron affected plasma phosphateconcentrationsorboneturnover,althoughtheinterventionperiod (∼5 mo) may have been insufficient to detect changes in these markers. Further studies are needed to discount the possibilitythatmoderatetosevereirondeficiencycauseshyperphosphaturia and hypophosphatemia in pregnant women.Special caution is warrantedwhenprescribingintravenousferriccarboxymaltosetoindividuals with iron deficiency.Our findings suggest that iron supplementation leads to increased glomerular filtration rates in women with poor ironstatus.This discovery is in agreement with a Mendelianrandomization study that showed serum iron concentration to be associated with glomerular filtration rates ( 29).In a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh, children whose mothers hadantenatally received a daily oral supplement containing 60 mg Fe/d had higher glomerular filtration rates at 4.5 y of age than those whose mothers received 30 mg Fe/d ( 30).
Children with a history of rickets had a reduced glomerular filtration rate as estimatedfromplasmacystatinCconcentration( 4).Furtherwork isneededtoelucidateapossibleroleofkidneyfunctionalongthecausal pathway between iron and rickets. In a prospective cohort study, increased total-FGF23 concen- tration was associated with an increase in all-cause mortalityin a general population of older US adults ( 31).Although this association may have been in part confounded by the effect of inflammation on FGF23 expression, it is possible that thereduction that is seen in maternal and infant total-FGF23 after antenatal iron supplementation confers a general health benefit.
Intriguingly, and in contrast to effects observed in pregnant women, antenatal iron supplementation led to increased intact- FGF23 concentrations in neonates, which conversely suggests thatmaternalirondeficiencyduringpregnancyleadsto decreased neonatalintact-FGF23concentrations,withoutanapparenteffect on neonatal serum phosphate concentration. These findings contradict reports from a study in neonatal pups born to femalewild-type mice which were fed an iron-deficient diet during the third week of pregnancy (corresponding to the human third trimester) and during lactation, and which developed increasedconcentrations of both intact-FGF23 and total-FGF23, as well as decreased phosphate concentrations ( 7).
From that report ( 7), however, it is not clear whether these outcomes were measuredimmediately after birth.Inanearlierprospectivecohortstudy,poormaternalironstatus during pregnancy was associated with a higher total-FGF23 concentration but similar intact-FGF23 concentrations in infants and young children ( 6). Unfortunately, however, these markers were not assessed at delivery.In contrast to the critical role that FGF23playsinregulatingphosphorusandskeletalmetabolismin adults and children, murine studies suggest that FGF23 may notbe required to regulate fetal phosphorus homeostasis, placental phosphorus transport, or skeletal development, perhaps because the placenta’s role to actively transport phosphorus and otherminerals from the maternal circulation is independent of FGF23 (32).In mice, fetal phosphate concentrations are relatively high and decrease within a few days after birth, concurrently withthe cessation of placental phosphate influx.
Within hours to days after loss of the placental phosphorus pump, neonatal FGF23 becomes an important regulator of renal phosphorus excretionand intestinal phosphorus absorption ( 32). It is possible that the effects of antenatal iron supplementation on offspring FGF23 and phosphate metabolism may only become apparent later ininfancy, and not at birth and so were not fully captured in this study.Antenatal iron supplementation also had an effect on vitamin D metabolism by decreasing maternal 25(OH)D concentration.Emerging evidence has found a biological link between vitamin D and iron metabolism.The vitamin D response element hasbeen identified on HAMP(the gene encoding hepcidin), and 1,25(OH) 2D has been shown to suppress hepcidin expression and thereby increase the amount of iron absorbed from thediet and released from stores ( 33).
It is possible that there is a negative feedback loop whereby when hepcidin concentrations arehigh(inironrepletion,orwithantenatalironsupplementation or with inflammation), 25(OH)D concentration decreases. Analternative pathway for decreases in maternal 25(OH)D is through direct effects of FGF23 on vitamin D metabolism.Higher FGF23 concentrations are known to downregulateCytochromeP450Family27SubfamilyBMember1( CYP27B1 ) expression and upregulate Cytochrome P450 Family 24 Sub- family A Member 1 ( CYP24A1 ) expression with the potential to lower 1,25(OH) 2D and raise 24,25(OH) 2D, respectively (34).We conclude that antenatal oral iron supplementation can redressperturbancesinmaternalandneonatalFGF23metabolism induced by maternal iron deficiency during pregnancy.This suggests the possibility that iron supplementation could helpprevent rickets and osteomalacia in individuals with an impaired ability to regulate FGF23 concentration.
