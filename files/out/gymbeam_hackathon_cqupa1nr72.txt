C-reactive protein (CRP) is an inﬂammatory marker found to be elevated in those conditions. Omega-3 fatty acids work against inﬂammation and lower CRP levels in obese individuals.This study compared high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) in adult obesity and central obesity in Indonesia based on omega-3 fatty acid intake using Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) 5 data.Secondary data from household questionnaires were obtained from the IFLS 5 online database.Data from 3152 subjects were used; 76.65% of the subjects were female, with a mean age of 45.27 ±15.77 years.Subjects were classiﬁed into ﬁve modiﬁed categories of obesity and central obesity based on body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC).Omega-3 fatty acid intake was categorized into “low” and “adequate” based on dietary recommendations from the Mediterranean Diet Foundation (2011).There is a signiﬁcant difference in hs-CRP based on modiﬁed obesity categories ( p< 0.05).
There was no signiﬁcant difference in hs-CRP between low and adequate omega-3 intake ( p> 0.05). These data suggest that hs-CRP is related to overweight, obesity, and central obesity.Meanwhile, omega-3 fatty acids are unrelated to hs-CRP .Further studies are needed to conﬁrm these results.Keywords: hs-CRP; obesity; central obesity; omega-3 fatty acid intake; inﬂammations; IFLS 5 1.Introduction Obesity has nearly tripled since 1975 according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The number of overweight adults reached more than 1.9 billion in 2016, of whom 650 million were obese [ 1].This trend also applies to developing countries, including Indonesia [ 2].According to Riset Kesehatan Dasar (Riskesdas), the prevalence of adult obesity above 18 years old in Indonesia is 21.8% in 2018, which had increased since 2013 [ 3].The diagnostic criteria for obesity are body mass index (BMI) ≥25 according to the WHO Asia-Paciﬁc standard [ 4].
The diagnostic criteria of central obesity agreed upon by Kemente- rian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia (Kemenkes RI) are deﬁned as a waist circumference (WC) of ≥90 cm for men and ≥80 cm for women [ 5]. Both obesity and central obesity have mainly been discussed in diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2), cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and metabolic syndrome [6–10].The imbalance of energy intake and expenditure is the basis of obesity [ 6,10], supported by multifactorial aspects such as genetics, environment, psychosocial conditions, drugs, Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2023 ,20, 6734.https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20186734 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2023 ,20, 6734 2 of 16 and hormones [ 6,11,12].Abdominal fat accumulation, which leads to central obesity, has been hypothesized to occur due to the inability of subcutaneous tissue to collect more fat.This could be a consequence of genetic predisposition or stress.
Visceral adipose tissue is known to be more active in terms of metabolism and lipolysis, which makes central obesity closely associated with a plethora of chronic diseases [ 13,14]. Excessive adipose tissue leads to several mechanisms which predispose comorbid conditions or complications.In obesity, the elevation of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, decrease in adiponectin, and increase in lipolysis happen.These lead to insulin resistance, escalation of blood triglyceride levels, and blood pressure elevation, which are detrimental to the development of chronic diseases [9,13,15,16].Low-grade chronic inﬂammation is one of the hallmarks of obesity and central obe- sity [ 17,18].Pro-inﬂammatory mediators such as IL-6, IFN- γ, and TNF- αincrease in obese and centrally obese individuals [ 19,20].IL-6 stimulates hepatocytes to release C-reactive protein (CRP) [ 21].
Chronic inﬂammation may elevate cortisol levels and oxidative stress, which promote the development of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions inducing various health problems [ 9,19,21,22]. Lifestyle modiﬁcation, notably increased omega-3 fatty acid consumption, could counteract this problem.Omega-3 fatty acids are inversely related to inﬂammation [ 17], as they can prevent the release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines through binding with the ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR120) [ 23–26], which in turn decreases CRP levels [ 11,15,16,27].Omega-3 fatty acids also reduce oxidative stress [15,28,29] and inhibit endothelial dysfunction [15,30–33].The anti-inﬂammatory effect of omega-3 fatty acids, which could be a beneﬁcial addition in managing obesity and central obesity, drives the initiation of this study.
With data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey 5 (IFLS 5), this study sought to determine hs-CRP differences in various obesity groups and varied omega-3 fatty acid intake levels. 2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Subjects’ Characteristics IFLS 5 is the ﬁfth wave of an Indonesian socioeconomic and health longitudinal survey, conducted in 2014–2015.The respondents from 1993 represent 83% of Indonesia’s total population who resided in 13 different provinces [ 34].Among numerous variables available, this study utilized sex, age, education, income, food consumption, weight, height, waist circumference (WC), and plasma equivalent levels of CRP .
Exclusion criteria included a history of chronic diseases such as hypertension, dia- betes, tuberculosis, asthma, other lung conditions, heart attack, coronary heart disease, other heart problems, stroke, cancer or malignant tumor, arthritis or rheumatism, prostate illness, kidney disease, and stomach or other digestive disorders because chronic diseases increase CRP levels [ 35,36]. Thus, they are confounding factors in this study.Smoking and pregnancy status or history of childbirth less than one year from data collection were also excluded.CRP levels are also elevated in smoking [ 37,38] and pregnancy [ 39,40].In addition, pregnancy would undoubtedly increase WC despite obesity or central obesity, and postpartum weight loss takes at least six months or more to return to weight before conception [41,42].There were 7579 subjects whose CRP levels were observed.
Subjects included were adults ( ≥19 years old) [ 43] whose sex, age, weight (kg), height (cm), WC (cm), and food consumption (ﬁsh, meat, eggs, and dairy) per week were recorded. Subjects who had a smoking history ( n= 2825), were pregnant or breastfeeding (n= 352) , had a history of chronic diseases, or birth within less than one year of this study (n= 21) were excluded from this study.Subjects under 19 years old were not included (n= 541) .Those who did not have sufﬁcient or applicable data for BMI ( n= 490) and those whose food frequency data for omega-3 fatty acid intake were insufﬁcient or missing (n= 198) were also excluded from this study.Following inclusion and exclusion criteria, 3152 subjects remained suitable for this study (Figure 1).Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2023 ,20, 6734 3 of 16 Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2023, 20, x 3 of 16 541).
Those who did not have suﬃcient or applicable data for BMI (n = 490) and those whose food frequency data for omega-3 fatty acid intake were insuﬃcient or missing (n = 198) were also excluded from this study. Following inclusion and exclusion criteria, 3152 subjects remained suitable for this study (Figure 1).Figure 1.Inclusion and exclusion criteria.The IFLS 5 survey and procedures have undergone ethical licensing assessments.They have been approved by the Institutional Board Review (IRB) in the United States and by the participating, Gadjah Mada University (UGM) in Indonesia.The ethical clear- ance number for IFLS 5 by RAND’s Human Subjects Protection Committee (RAND’s IRB) was s0064-06-01-CR01 [44].Research Ethics Committee Universitas Padjadjaran Bandung approved the current study and released ethical clearance with the number 1339/UN6.KEP/EC/2022.2.2.
Laboratory Data of hs-CRP Data were obtained from the IFLS 5 online database by measuring dried blood spot (DBS) values converted into CRP plasma equivalent values. However, the values gener- ated may not represent those obtained from venous blood.Blood samples were obtained by ﬁnger prick on ﬁlter paper, which was then stored and processed in laboratory analysis using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method [45].2.3.Obesity and Central Obesity Assessments Weight and height records were obtained from the book US with the code US06 for weight and US04 for height.BMI was calculated by weight (kg) divided by the square of height (m2) [6].Waist circumference (WC) records were obtained in the same book with the code US06a [34,46].The classi ﬁcation of obesity was based on the WHO Asia-Paci ﬁc standard [4], while the classi ﬁcation of central obesity followed the Kemenkes RI standard [5].
Subjects were divided into ﬁve categories based on BMI measurements: precisely normal, overweight, obese, centrally obese, and a combination of obese and centrally obese. Normal subjects had a BMI of <23, overweight subjects had a BMI of 23–24.9, and Figure 1.Inclusion and exclusion criteria.The IFLS 5 survey and procedures have undergone ethical licensing assessments.They have been approved by the Institutional Board Review (IRB) in the United States and by the participating, Gadjah Mada University (UGM) in Indonesia.The ethical clearance number for IFLS 5 by RAND’s Human Subjects Protection Committee (RAND’s IRB) was s0064-06- 01-CR01 [ 44].Research Ethics Committee Universitas Padjadjaran Bandung approved the current study and released ethical clearance with the number 1339/UN6.KEP/EC/2022.2.2.Laboratory Data of hs-CRP Data were obtained from the IFLS 5 online database by measuring dried blood spot (DBS) values converted into CRP plasma equivalent values.
However, the values generated may not represent those obtained from venous blood. Blood samples were obtained by ﬁnger prick on ﬁlter paper, which was then stored and processed in laboratory analysis using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method [45].2.3.Obesity and Central Obesity Assessments Weight and height records were obtained from the book US with the code US06 for weight and US04 for height.BMI was calculated by weight (kg) divided by the square of height (m2) [6].Waist circumference (WC) records were obtained in the same book with the code US06a [ 34,46].The classiﬁcation of obesity was based on the WHO Asia- Paciﬁc standard [ 4], while the classiﬁcation of central obesity followed the Kemenkes RI standard [5].Subjects were divided into ﬁve categories based on BMI measurements: precisely normal, overweight, obese, centrally obese, and a combination of obese and centrally obese.
Normal subjects had a BMI of <23, overweight subjects had a BMI of 23–24.9, and obese subjects had a BMI of ≥25, all with WC of <90 cm for men and <80 cm for women. Subjects with central obesity were those who exclusively had a WC of ≥90 cm for men and ≥80 cm for women.Subjects with both obesity and central obesity fell under the combination category with both a BMI of ≥25 and WC of ≥90 cm for men and ≥80 cm for women.Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2023 ,20, 6734 4 of 16 2.4.Omega-3 Fatty Acid Food Source Intake Measurements The intake of omega-3 fatty acid food sources was based on four main food groups rich in omega-3 fatty acids: ﬁsh, meat, eggs, and dairy [ 47–49].Food consumption frequency was recorded in book 3B with the code FM02B and FM03B for eggs, FM02C and FM03C for ﬁsh, FM02D and FM03D for meat, and FM02E and FM03E for dairy.The frequency noted was for the consumption of these food groups in one week before data collection started [46].
The Mediterranean diet standard performed categorization which supports high omega-3 fatty acid intake [ 50]. This study followed dietary recommendations from the Mediterranean Diet Foundation (2011) [ 51,52].The recommended diet is an egg intake of at least two times per week, a ﬁsh intake of at least two times per week, a meat intake of at least two times per week, and a dairy intake of at least seven times per week or daily [ 51,52].Subjects were considered to have “adequate” intake if they completely fulﬁlled the criteria.Otherwise, results were considered “low” intake.2.5.Other Variables of the Study Sex, age, education, and income were also included in this study.Sex was categorized into male and female with data obtained from form T2 with the code FT05 [ 46].Age was the age from birth until the year of data collection, acquired from form T2 with the code FT06 [ 46] and categorized into three ranges, which are 19–44 (adults), 45–59 (pre-elderly), and≥60 (elderly) [ 43].
Education was the last education level, obtained from book 3A with the code DL10, categorized into elementary, junior high, senior high, and D1, D2, and D3/university [ 46]. Income was noted in IDR based on monthly payment, obtained from book 3A with the code TK16a and TK16a1, categorized into <IDR 2 million, IDR 2–8 million, IDR 8–10 million, and >IDR 10 million [46].2.6.Statistical Analysis Pearson’s chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests were used to determine independence or association between categorical variables.The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to determine the normality of the dataset, and Levene’s test was used to determine the homogeneity of variances.Normality assumptions were not met ( p< 0.05), while homoscedasticity assumptions were met ( p> 0.05).Therefore, nonparametric tests were used in this study.
When comparing between more than two independent groups, the Kruskal–Wallis H test was performed, followed by the Mann–Whitney U test as post hoc testing if the previous test showed a signiﬁcant difference. The Mann–Whitney U test was used when comparing two independent groups.The Bonferroni correction method was also performed.p< 0.05 was taken as the rejection value of the null hypothesis.Statistical analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel 2019 (version 16.43, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and Stata/MP (version 14.1, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).3.Results 3.1.Study Population Subjects’ demographics are presented in Table 1.There were more female subjects (76.65%) than male subjects (23.35%).The mean age was 45.27 ±15.77 years.The age range of 19–44 had the highest number of subjects ( n= 1591), making up 50.48% of the current study population.The prevalence of the age ranges had a decreasing trend with an increase in years.
Education data were only available for 442 subjects. Most subjects completed elemen- tary education (34.84%), followed by a diploma or university education (33.26%).Income data were also only available for 161 subjects; most subjects had an income of less than IDR two million (84.71%).No subject was noted who had an income between IDR eight and ten million.Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2023 ,20, 6734 5 of 16 Table 1.Baseline characteristics of subjects.

Data are shown as frequency and percentage.
According to the modiﬁed obesity categories, 1005 (31.88%) were normal, 358 (11.36%) were overweight, 603 (19.13%) were obese, 397 (12.60%) were centrally obese, and 789 (25.03%) were both obese and centrally obese. The majority of subjects had normal BMI and WC.According to the Mediterranean diet standard, most subjects had low omega-3 fatty acid intake (96.29%).Only 117 subjects (3.71%) had adequate omega-3 fatty acid intake.There were only 309 subjects whose fast food intake was accounted for.Subjects mostly had low physical activity (41.66%), followed by high physical activity (33.72%).In Table 2, subjects’ demographics and data are further classiﬁed into the respective obesity categories.The hs-CRP values, shown as median (min.–max.), are also present here.Sex and obesity categories did not have an independent relation ( p= 0.000).There was also a signiﬁcant association between age and obesity categories ( p= 0.000).
Among normal subjects, elementary education had the highest prevalence (43.59%). Senior high education was the highest in the overweight category (35.45%).For the rest of the categories, most of the subjects completed their education up to the diploma or university level (45.04% for the obesity category, 100% for the central obesity category, and 83.33% for the combination category).However, the education data for central obesity and combination categories were very limited, with only three and two data noted.Most subjects in the respective categories had an IDR two million or lower income.In the aforementioned income category, 44 (93.62%) were normal, 7 (41.18%) were overweight, 23 (92%) were obese, 22 (91.67%) were centrally obese, and 48 (84.21%) were both obese and centrally obese.Education and obesity categories had an independent relation ( p= 0.617).Most subjects across all obesity categories had low omega-3 fatty acid intake.
The overweight category had the fewest number of subjects with adequate omega-3 fatty acid intake ( n= 8), while the combination category had the greatest number of subjects (n= 33) . For subjects with low omega-3 fatty acid intake, the normal category had the highest number of subjects ( n= 975), and the overweight category had the lowest ( n= 350).There was a signiﬁcant association between omega-3 fatty acid intake and obesity categories (p= 0.02).Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2023 ,20, 6734 6 of 16 As seen in Table 2, there was no signiﬁcant association between fast food intake and obesity categories ( p= 0.42).Physical activity and obesity categories also had no signiﬁcant association ( p= 0.96).Table 2.Baseline characteristics of subjects based on respective obesity categories.

Comparison of hs-CRP Based on Omega-3 Fatty Acid Intake Levels Table 6 shows no signiﬁcant difference when comparing hs-CRP values based on omega-3 fatty acid intake levels by the Mediterranean diet standard ( p= 0.93).Those with adequate omega-3 fatty acid intake had a slightly higher hs-CRP value than those with a low omega-3 fatty acid intake (median [IQR] = 0.12 (0.04–0.25) mg/dL vs.0.10 (0.04–0.26) mg/dL).Table 6.Comparison of hs-CRP based on omega-3 fatty acid intake levels.

Data are shown as median (min.–max.).The hs-CRP values based on omega-3 fatty acid intake levels yielded no signiﬁcant difference.4.Discussion The current study aimed to compare the hs-CRP values between assorted obesity categories and different omega-3 fatty acid intake levels among 3152 subjects whose hs- CRP values were collected through the IFLS 5 survey.The particular secondary data used in this study measured CRP concentrations using the hs-CRP ELISA method.This method is more sensitive to low-grade inﬂammation and is, therefore suitable for this study.In this investigation, the results yielded a signiﬁcant difference in hs-CRP values based on different obesity categories.However, there was no signiﬁcant difference in hs-CRP values based on omega-3 fatty acid intake levels.
Most subjects had low omega-3 fatty acid intake according to the Mediterranean diet standard. The discrepancy between the number of subjects who had adequate and low omega-3 fatty acid intake was also notably high ( n= 117 vs.n= 3035).The previously mentioned result is in line with a study claiming that ﬁsh intake, which affects omega-3 levels in individuals, was very low compared to the vast amount of ﬁsh resources available among Indonesians [53].Results showed a signiﬁcant difference in hs-CRP values between subjects with normal BMI and WC and those with higher BMI and WC.Several previous studies also showed similar results.In a systematic review and meta-analysis by Choi et al.(2013), an increased odds of elevated CRP was related to obesity and overweight in all populations [ 54].A study by Paepegaeya et al.(2015) showed that CRP was positively correlated with an increase in BMI and fat mass [ 55].
The pathophysiology linking obesity and elevated CRP levels has been widely discussed. Fat accumulation, especially in the abdomen, is tightly related to the development of enlarged and damaged adipose cells [ 9].Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ that produces cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, IL-18, and chemokines [ 6,21].Moreover, free fatty acids activate serine kinase pro-inﬂammatory cascades, such as IkkapaB (IkB) kinase (IKK) and c-JunN-terminal kinase (JNK) [ 21,56].These cascades induce the production of cytokines and stimulate the hepatic synthesis of CRP [ 21].The transcription of CRP typically happens in hepatocytes as a Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2023 ,20, 6734 9 of 16 response of cytokine elevation, particularly IL-6 [ 21,57].Its effect is further ampliﬁed by IL-1 [57].Therefore, obesity is considered a low-grade inﬂammatory disease [17,18].Nonetheless, there were some limitations in this study that should be addressed.
The data utilized were gathered manually as secondary data, which implies that there could have been human errors during measurement or data recording. Subject bias was also inevitable as these were data from questionnaires.The hs-CRP levels used were also plasma equivalent values converted from the dried blood spot (DBS) method results.Hence, the values may not entirely represent those taken directly from venous blood [ 45].The hs- CRP values of subjects could also be inﬂuenced by factors in subjects’ lives that could not be considered in this study.Hence, the differences of hs-CRP values in this study may not be completely attributed to BMI and WC.Food choices or patterns could affect CRP concentrations.A systematic review by Defag óet al.(2014) aimed to ﬁnd the correlation between food patterns and endothelial biomarkers.
From these studies, it can be deduced that Westernized food patterns that are high in processed meats, sweets, fried foods, and reﬁned grains showed a positive association with inﬂammatory markers such as CRP . Concurrently, healthy food patterns rich in fruits and vegetables had a more favorable inﬂuence on circulating CRP levels [ 58].Food choices could also impact hs-CRP levels despite BMI and WC.Another possible confounder in this study is physical activity.The association between physical activity and CRP is also discussed in some studies.Loprinzi et al.(2013) enrolled US adults and children to examine the association between objectively measured physical activity with an accelerometer and CRP .It was found that physical activity was inversely correlated with CRP in adults but unrelated in children [ 59].A cross-sectional study conducted by Le ón-Latre et al.(2014) investigated the association between a sedentary lifestyle and inﬂammatory markers in healthy male workers.
Workers with more sitting time had a worse inﬂammatory proﬁle with higher CRP levels [ 60]. A review article by Michigan et al.(2011) analyzed the response of CRP levels to different exercise regimens in various age groups.The combination of diet and exercise programs appeared to have more signiﬁcant effects than just physical activity alone, with substantial CRP reductions in ﬁve trials [61].Psychosocial stress also affects CRP levels and is a confounding factor in this study.A systematic review by Johnson et al.(2013) evaluated the impact of chronic psychosocial stress on CRP levels.From 41 articles analyzing different types of stress, it was concluded that psychosocial stress signiﬁcantly elevated CRP levels [ 62].Negative emotions such as stress and depression may directly inﬂuence elevated pro-inﬂammatory cytokine produc- tion [ 63,64].Another systematic review by Howren et al.
(2009) assessed the correlation between depression and inﬂammatory markers such as CRP , IL-1, and IL-6. Clinically de- pressed patient samples showed the strongest positive correlations, though signiﬁcance was also noted in community samples [ 64].Stress-related behaviors such as sleep disturbances also showed a positive correlation to inﬂammation and, thus, higher CRP levels [ 65,66].Cellular activation induced by stress could be mediated by the nuclear factor kappa-light- chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF- κB).Through NF- κB activation, pro-inﬂammatory cytokines are released, increasing CRP [67,68].Sex and age could affect CRP concentrations to a certain level.According to Lakoski et al.(2006), CRP levels were found to be higher in women than men despite confounders being accounted for [ 69].A study by Wyczalkowska-Tomasik et al.
(2015) stated that healthy older adults showed higher serum CRP levels compared to younger counterparts, though the values still fell below the normal range [ 70]. Wener et al.(2000) also found differences in CRP concentrations based on age and gender [ 71].Genetic variation is also a factor that can inﬂuence low-grade inﬂammation, but there was no information on this from the utilized data.Galm és et al.(2019) stated that inﬂammation and omega-3 fatty acid response could be inﬂuenced by genetic variation [ 72].A meta-analysis by Ligthart et al.(2016) discovered that many genetic loci were associated with chronic low-grade inﬂammation [73].Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2023 ,20, 6734 10 of 16 Although many studies claimed that omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inﬂammatory effects and are inversely related to inﬂammatory markers such as hs-CRP , this study showed no signiﬁcant difference.The results of this study may be attributed to some confounding factors.
Food frequency of large food groups were the only data available from IFLS 5. Food preparation, types of food, and the number of servings needed to be clearly deﬁned.Speciﬁcally for ﬁsh, a study stated that there is more omega-3 fatty acid content in marine ﬁsh such as salmon, sea bass, cod, and barramundi than freshwater ﬁsh such as carp [ 74].Different preparation methods could also alter the content of omega-3 PUFA in ﬁsh.The lowest amounts of omega-3 fatty acids could be seen in the deep-frying method preparation of New Zealand king salmon in a study conducted by Alsen et al.(2010) [ 75].A survey by Nett et al.(2014) also showed that fried ﬁsh tend to have more omega-6 and MUFA content, possibly due to the canola oil used for frying [ 76].Hence, the preparation, type, and number of servings of ﬁsh impact the amount of omega-3 fatty acids consumed.
A diet high in omega-6 PUFA could potentially be harmful instead, even contribut- ing to the development of breast cancer, according to a few studies [ 77–79]. This could be due to competition between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids for cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes, which then affect the synthesis of eicosanoids.Eicosanoids participate in a few physiological processes, such as pro-/anti-inﬂammatory response, pro-/anti-platelet aggregation, vasodilation/vasoconstriction, immune response, and cell growth and development.Eicosanoids derived from omega-3 PUFA, such as eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA), have anti-inﬂammatory effects, while eicosanoids derived from omega-6 PUFA, such as arachidonic acids (AA) have pro-inﬂammatory effects.Con- sumption of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA through food intake has a direct effect on tissue levels and eicosanoid metabolites of both PUFA [ 16,47,80].
Inﬂammation is linked to the release of cytokine production, which then affects the release of CRP from hepatocytes. Therefore, omega-6 could potentially increase CRP .Besides ﬁsh, the types of dairy and meat consumed could also impact hs-CRP .Pro- cessed dairy products high in reﬁned sugars and processed red meats would contribute to the unhealthy eating pattern associated with higher CRP levels, as mentioned previ- ously [ 58].It is also important to note that besides the four general groups of food consisting of eggs, ﬁsh, meat, and dairy, subjects consumed many other foods that might impact their food patterns and, thus, CRP levels.This anonymous information might also alter one’s adequacy status of omega-3 fatty acid intake since other foods such as seafood, nuts, seeds, certain oils, and grains are also high in omega-3 fatty acids [47–49].
Other than the factors mentioned above, the categorization of omega-3 fatty acid intake based on the Mediterranean diet standard also had its ﬂaws. The complete dietary recommendation from Mediterranean Diet Foundation (2011) does not only consist of eggs, ﬁsh, meat, and dairy.It includes various other food groups such as olive oil, vegetables, fruits, bread and cereals, legumes, nuts, and red wine [ 51,52].Consequently, the omega-3 fatty acid content analyzed in this study might not be wholly accurate, as consumption of other food might also increase omega-3 fatty acid intake and vice versa.However, only four food groups could be assessed due to data limitations.Some previous studies also showed no association between increased omega-3 fatty acid intake and CRP levels.Madsen et al.(2003) conducted a prospective 60-person survey with omega-3 PUFA supplements.
It was concluded that dietary supplementation of omega- 3 fatty acids did not affect serum concentrations of CRP in healthy subjects [ 81]. Another prospective study conducted by Chan et al.(2002) investigated the effects of treatment with atorvastatin and ﬁsh oil on hs-CRP in individuals with visceral obesity.The decrease in plasma hs-CRP was seen with atorvastatin or atorvastatin with ﬁsh oil treatment but not with ﬁsh oil alone [ 82].These two studies utilized ﬁsh oil supplements with more concentrated levels of omega-3 fatty acids than those obtained from a normal diet.There is also a prospective 21-person study by Mezzano et al.(2001) that compared Mediterranean and high-fat diets, supposedly high in omega-3 PUFA content, on plasma concentrations of Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2023 ,20, 6734 11 of 16 hemostatic cardiovascular risk factors.There was no effect on CRP levels from either diet observed in healthy male individuals [83].
However, other studies contradicted this study’s results and showed positive correla- tions between omega-3 fatty acid intake and CRP levels. A survey by Saifullah et al.(2007) investigated the effects of 12-week ﬁsh oil supplementation on 27 hemodialysis patients in cardiovascular risk biomarkers.There was a reduction in both mean CRP levels and triglyceride levels in patients [ 84].Another study by Mortazavi et al.(2018) enrolled 46 male patients with cardiovascular disease to observe the effects of omega-3 PUFA sup- plementation on serum apelin levels, hs-CRP , and lipid proﬁles.The supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids decreases serum hs-CRP levels.Tsitouras et al.(2008) also studied the inﬂuence of a high omega-3 fatty acid diet with 720 g of fatty ﬁsh weekly and 15 mL of sardine oil daily on healthy older adults.There was a notable reduction in serum CRP levels [85].
The anti-inﬂammatory effect of omega-3 fatty acids in relation to CRP could be through the inhibition of IKK and JNK phosphorylation, which in turn inhibits the NF- κB signaling process. EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were found to be effective in inhibiting NF-κB through the activation of G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) [ 15,24–26].The IKK complex takes part in the signal transduction cascade of NF- κB, a protein complex that controls the production of cytokines and, thus, affects genes related to inﬂammation.Transcription of CRP takes part in hepatocytes as a response to elevated inﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-6 [ 57].Therefore, inhibition of NF- κB by omega-3 fatty acids could decrease inﬂammatory cytokines and indirectly decrease CRP levels.Another mechanism related to omega-3 fatty acids’ anti-inﬂammatory inﬂuence could be through the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α/γ.
PPAR αactivation inhibits NF- κB signaling, resulting in decreased production of inﬂam- matory cytokines. In addition, the PPAR γligand can inhibit macrophage activation and production of inﬂammatory cytokines, such as TNF- α, IL-6, and IL-1 β[15,86,87].Omega-3 fatty acids can also regulate leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxane synthesis [ 15].Reducing inﬂammatory cytokines will reduce the release of CRP by hepatocytes, and CRP serum concentration will decrease.Concurring with the discussion above, CRP and omega-3 fatty acids are important parameters for consideration in obesity because they are associated with inﬂammation and metabolic health, which play signiﬁcant roles in the development and management of obesity.Several other factors could also inﬂuence obesity.However, the data utilized in this study, although they encompass a major portion of Indonesia, were unfortunately very limited in relevance to inﬂammation in obesity.
Thus, the current study was only able to use hs-CRP and omega-3 data to investigate inﬂammation in obesity. 5.Conclusions In conclusion, a signiﬁcant difference in hs-CRP values was found between those who had normal BMI and WC compared to those who had higher BMI and WC.There was a notable increasing trend between those with normal BMI and WC and those with higher BMI and WC.Food choices, physical activity, and psychosocial stress are possible confounders in this study as they could affect hs-CRP concentrations.The result of no signiﬁcant difference in hs-CRP values between adequate and low omega-3 fatty acid intake should be taken with a grain of salt, as the secondary data used in this study were limited in terms of food consumption.Food frequencies in general food groups were the only available data from IFLS 5 and, thus, categorization was also loosely based on the Mediterranean diet standard.
Further research should focus on ﬁnding the inﬂuence of obesity and omega-3 fatty acids on hs-CRP concentrations while considering that many other factors that could alter hs-CRP . Utilization of food data containing detailed information on preparation methods, types of food, and the number of servings could be beneﬁcial.This would allow a more Int.J.Environ.Res.Public Health 2023 ,20, 6734 12 of 16 accurate analysis, bringing more clinical relevance to practice and allowing optimal care for the population involved.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, G.M.and N.I.; methodology, G.M., N.I.and D.M.D.H.; software, A.A.J.and C.K.; validation, G.M., N.I.and A.A.J.; formal analysis, G.M., N.I., A.A.J.and C.K.; investigation, G.M., N.I.and A.A.J.; resources, G.M., N.I.and A.A.J.; writing—original draft preparation, G.M., N.I.and A.A.J.; writing—review and editing, G.M., N.I., D.M.D.H., D.A.G.and I.M.; visualization, G.M.and N.I.; supervision, D.M.D.H., D.A.G.
