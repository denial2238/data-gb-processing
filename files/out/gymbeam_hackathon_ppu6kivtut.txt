However, its use to prevent or improve the health of skin is growing dizzyingly. Therefore, this study investigated whether collagen peptides could induce ﬁbroblast and keratinocyte proliferation and activation beyond reducing an inﬂam- matory response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).Human skin ﬁbroblasts (CCD-1072Sk) and human keratinocytes (hKT-nh-skp-KT0026) were seeded at a concentration of 5 ×104cells/mL.LPS (10 ng/mL) and three doses of collagen peptides (2.5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL, 10 mg/mL) were used.The readout parameters were cell proliferation; expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); expression of pro-collagen-1 αby ﬁbroblasts; and secretion of interleukin-1 β(IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL- 6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor α(TNF- α), transforming growth factor β(TGF- β), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by both cell types.
The results demonstrated that all doses of collagen supplementation induced increased proliferation of both human ﬁbroblasts ( p< 0.01) and human keratinocytes ( p< 0.001), while only the dose of 10 mg/mL induced an increased expression of pro-collagen-1 αby ﬁbroblasts. Similarly, only the dose of 10 mg/mL reduced LPS-induced iNOS expression in ﬁbroblasts ( p< 0.05) and keratinocytes ( p< 0.01).In addition, collagen supplementation reduced the LPS-induced IL-1 β(p< 0.05), IL-6 ( p< 0.001), IL-8 ( p< 0.01), and TNF- α(p< 0.05), and increased the TGF- βand VEGF expression in ﬁbroblasts.Furthermore, collagen supplementation reduced the LPS-induced IL-1 β(p< 0.01), IL-6 ( p< 0.01), IL-8 ( p< 0.01), and TNF- α(p< 0.001), and increased the TGF- β(p< 0.05) and VEGF ( p< 0.05) expression in keratinocytes.
In conclusion, collagen peptides were found to induce ﬁbroblast and keratinocyte proliferation and pro-collagen-1 α expression, involving increased expression of TGF- βand VEGF, as well as the suppression of an inﬂammatory response induced by LPS.

https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14234975 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4975 2 of 13 types, skin ﬁbroblasts are the main cell type present in skin connective tissue (dermis), presenting a crucial role as effector cells executing physiologic tissue repair, and pathologi- cal ﬁbrogenesis leading to chronic ﬁbrosing conditions in certain circumstances [ 2]. Skin ﬁbroblasts also participate in the immune response of the skin, mainly releasing cytokines and growth factors [ 3].During senescence, aging-induced immunosenescence predisposes inﬂammatory disturbances of the skin, including pruritic dermatoses and type 2 inﬂamma- tion [ 3].This immunosenescence is characterized by a chronic release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines driving type 2 inﬂammatory dermatoses [ 3].Therefore, scientists around the world are looking for strategies that are capable of preventing skin infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals [ 4].
In addition to skin ﬁbroblasts, keratinocytes are cells with a vital function in the immune response of the skin, as well as their classical role in synthetizing keratin [ 5]. For instance, keratinocytes may be deeply hyperactivated by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus , resulting in a huge synthesis and release of interleukin (IL) IL-6 and IL-8 [5], establishing an inﬂammatory response.Furthermore, collagen is the main extracellular matrix protein in the skin structure [ 6].Collagen synthesis changes during aging, with a reduction of 80 percent of type I collagen and 15 percent of type III collagen to a complete loss of type I collagen and type III collagen ﬁbers becoming thicker and shorter [ 6].Such alterations result in stiffening of the skin and a loss of humidity and elasticity, along with becoming more susceptible to infections [ 3–6].Collagen-based products are found in a lot of pharmaceuticals, medicine, food, and cosmetics products for a wide variety of applications [ 7].
It may beneﬁt several aspects of health, including wound healing, dental therapy, sarcopenia, bone defects, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis, especially for aging people [ 7]. Therefore, knowledge and understanding of the effects of collagen-based products on different aspects of health and disease due to their increasing rate of use among athletes and individuals looking for aesthetic goals are urgently requested.However, so far, whether supplementation with collagen peptides may inhibit the inﬂammatory process in the skin through the activation of skin ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes is unknown.Therefore, the present study investigated whether collagen peptides may inhibit the inﬂammatory process induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in skin ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes and whether collagen peptides may induce collagen synthesis by skin ﬁbroblasts.2.Material and Methods 2.1.
Cell Lines and Experimental Design Human ﬁbroblasts (CCD-1072Sk) and human keratinocytes (hKT-nh-skp-KT0026) were purchased from the Cell Bank of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Both cell lineages were cultivated in a humid atmosphere in a 5% CO 2incubator at 37◦C.The cells were seeded at a concentration of 5 ×104cells/mL in a 24-well plate using the RPMI 1640 medium and 10% bovine fetal serum with a high amount of glucose.LPS from Escherichia coli (026:B6; L3755) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA).The experiments were done in triplicate and repeated once.Thus, the results represent the average of six individual wells±the standard deviation.2.2.
Experimental Design Human ﬁbroblasts (CCD-1072Sk) and human keratinocytes (hKT-nh-skp-KT0026) were seeded at a concentration of 5 ×104cells/mL in a 24-well plate and the following conditions were created: (1) control (only medium stimulated), (2) lipopolysaccharide (LPS 10 ng/mL), (3) collagen 2.5 mg/mL, (4) collagen 5 mg/mL, (5) collagen 10 mg/mL, (6) LPS + collagen 2.5 mg/mL, (7) LPS + collagen 5 mg/mL, and (8) LPS + collagen 10 mg/mL. LPS was added for 1 h, followed by the addition of collagen in the doses described above for another 17 h to complete the total overnight period of 18 h.Hydrolyzed collagen (types I and III of hydrolyzed collagen) was kindly supplied by PeptPure®(Peptpure, Jundiai, São Paulo, Brazil).Table 1 shows the physicochemical, microbiological, and molecular characteristics of the PeptPure®collagen peptides.Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4975 3 of 13 Table 1.Molecular, physicochemical, and microbiological characteristics of the PeptPure®colla- gen peptides.

Cell Proliferation Measurements Brieﬂy, the initial number of cells was previously known and seeded into the cell culture plates. After stimulations according to the experimental setup described above, the cells were carefully harvested and counted using the automated cell counter Countess 3 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA).The results were expressed for ﬁbroblasts as the number of cells ×104/mL and for keratinocytes as the number of cells ×105/mL.Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4975 4 of 13 2.4.Inﬂammatory Mediators, Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), and Pro-Collagen-1 αExpression Reverse transcription–quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed.Total RNA ex- tracted from cell samples was converted to cDNA using a SuperScript®III RT kit (Invitro- gen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.The concentration of RNA was detected using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA).GAPDH and 18S rRNA were used as the internal control.
The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 95◦C for 10 min followed by 35 cycles of 95◦C for 15 s and 55◦C for 40 s. The 2−∆∆Cqmethod was used to quantify the relative gene expression levels of the target genes.Relative standard curves were generated using serial dilutions, and all samples were run in triplicate [8].
The following sequences were used: Pro-collagen-1 αforward 5′-CGATGGATTCCAGTTCGAGTA-3′, reverse 5′-GTTTACA GGAAGCAGACAGG-3′[9]; iNOS forward 5′-CTATCAGGAAGAAATGCAGGAGAT-3′, reverse 5′-GAGCACGCTGAGTACCTCATT-3′[8]; IL-1 β[5] forward 5′-GCAACTGTTCCTG AACTCAACT-3′, reverse 5′-ATCTTTTGGGGTCCGTCAACT-3′; IL-6 [ 4] forward 5′-AACCT GAACCTTCCAAAGATGG-3′, reverse 5′-TCTGGCTTGTTCCTCACTACT-3′; IL-8 [ 4] for- ward 5′-CATACTCCAAACCTTTCCACCCC-3′, reverse 5′-TCAGCCCTCTTCAAAAACTT CTCCA-3′; tumor necrosis factor α(TNF- α) [5] forward 5′-CTGAACTTCGGGGTGATCGG- 3′, reverse 5′-GGCTTGTCACTCGAATTTTGAGA-3′; and vascular endothelial growth fac- tor (VEGF) [ 3] forward 5′-TGCAGATTATGCGGATCAAACC-3′, reverse 5′-TGCATTCACAT TTGTTGTGCTGTAG-3′. 2.5.Cell Proliferation Cell (human ﬁbroblasts (CCD-1072Sk) and human keratinocytes (hKT-nh-skp-KT0026)) proliferation was calculated by subtracting the number of cells obtained at the end of the experiment from the number of cells initially placed (5 ×104cells/mL).
Thus, the re- sults were expressed as the number of ﬁbroblasts (CCD-1072Sk) and human keratinocytes (hKT-nh-skp-KT0026) per milliliter. 2.6.Cytokines and Growth Factors Measurement The supernatant obtained from skin ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes was used to measure the levels of IL-1 β(DY201), IL-6 (DY206), IL-8 (DY208), TNF- α(DY210), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF- β1) (DY240), and VEGF (DY293) using Duo Set ELISA kits from R&D Systems according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and using a microplate reader SpectraMax I3 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).The results were expressed in pg/mL.2.7.

Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4975 11 of 13 4.Discussion This is the ﬁrst study that demonstrated that supplementation with hydrolyzed col- lagen effectively inhibited the inﬂammatory response in human skin ﬁbroblasts and ker- atinocytes under LPS stimulation, as well as induced the expression of pro-collagen-1 α, which is a precursor of type I collagen ﬁbers, in a process that involved the synthesis and release of the growth factors TGF- βand VEGF.It is well known that the transformations that occur in the skin during senescence [ 3] and in some diseases, such as dermatoses [ 3], may increase the risk of infections that originate due to a virus [ 10], bacteria [ 11], and fungi [ 12].In the present study, we demon- strated for the ﬁrst time that hydrolyzed types I and III collagen importantly inhibited the inﬂammatory response induced by LPS in human ﬁbroblasts (CCD-1072Sk) and human keratinocytes (hKT-nh-skp-KT0026).
Such ﬁndings are extremely relevant once the senes- cence increases the incidence of mostly bacterial infections in the elderly [ 13]. Therefore, it is plausible to hypothesize that hydrolyzed collagen could be useful for maintaining the immune integrity of the skin.In addition, increased susceptibility to infection was attributed to a process of immunesenescence and inﬂammaging [ 13].Typical examples in- clude Gram-negative bacterial colonization of the oropharynx due to a reduced production of adherence proteins for Gram-positive bacteria and the prevalence of skin colonization byProteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the elderly, which is increased by approx- imately 25% compared with adults [ 13].So far, although several questions regarding the possible anti-inﬂammatory effects and the possible mechanisms of action of collagen sup- plementation remain to be elucidated, a study from Orhan et al.
(2021) demonstrated that undenatured type II collagen ameliorated inﬂammation in a rat model of osteoarthritis [ 14]. It was reported that cytokines play a key role in the initiation, severity, and duration of the inﬂammatory process of the skin [ 15,16].In addition, the central involvement of ﬁbroblasts [ 15] and keratinocytes [ 16] in this process was demonstrated.Therefore, the present study showed for the ﬁrst time that hydrolyzed collagen inhibited the LPS-induced release of an important and classical panel of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF- α) from human skin ﬁbroblasts (CCD-1072Sk) and human keratinocytes (hKT-nh-skp- KT0026).Thus, here we discuss the role of each of these cytokines in the modulation of skin inﬂammation and healing.
In fact, IL-1 βwas reported as a potent pro-inﬂammatory cytokine that is synthesized and released by keratinocytes upon activation of Staphylococcus aureus [15] and by ﬁbroblast upon activation of Cutibacterium acnes [17], and its increased levels are related to cell death and damage. The present study showed for the ﬁrst time that hydrolyzed collagen reduced IL-1 βsecretion by skin ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes.Similar to IL-1 β, IL-6, which is another potent pro-inﬂammatory cytokine, plays an important role in the initiation and chroniﬁcation of the inﬂammatory response of the skin, as well as in wound healing [ 18].On the one hand, IL-6 is essential for inducing the initial immune response that aims to eliminate a pathogen; however, an excess of IL-6 may induce a variety of harmful effects, requiring its inhibition to physiological levels to resolve the inﬂamma- tory process and the tissue healing properly.
Accordingly, the present study showed that hydrolyzed collagen was capable of reducing LPS-induced IL-6 release by skin ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes. In addition, IL-8, which is a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine with strong chemotactic activity for neutrophils, is involved mostly in skin bacterial infections, con- tributing to the exacerbation of inﬂammation and skin structural cell death [ 19].Therefore, in the present study, hydrolyzed collagen reduced LPS-induced IL-8 release, reinforcing its anti-inﬂammatory properties.TNF- αbelongs to a family of cytokines that can kill tumoral cells and possesses very high pro-inﬂammatory properties [ 19,20].In addition, TNF- αwas described as a pivotal cytokine that is involved in the pathophysiology of psoriasis and also as a mediator of focal infection in skin lesions [ 19,20].Thus, the relevance of hydrolyzed collagen in reducing LPS-induced excessive TNF- αrelease is guaranteed.
An excessive release of these pro-inﬂammatory cytokines may activate another impor- tant signaling pathway that is involved in inﬂammation and tissue repair and also in ﬁbrosis in the case of excessive activation, which is modulated by the growth factors TGF- β[20] Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4975 12 of 13 and VEGF [ 21]. TGF- βis a classical pro-ﬁbrotic factor that provides a key role in wound healing when present at physiological levels [ 22].On the other hand, excessive levels of TGF- βresult in an impaired wound-healing process characterized by the dysregulated aggregation of extracellular matrix components, triggering ﬁbrotic scar formation [ 22].In the present study, it was found that LPS stimulation plus hydrolyzed collagen in ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes induced an increase in the expression of TGF- β, demonstrating for the ﬁrst time that hydrolyzed collagen-induced TGF- βexpression.
Thus, it is plausible to postulate that hydrolyzed collagen may support skin collagen synthesis, and with TGF- βin skin ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes, hydrolyzed collagen also induced the expression of pro- collagen-1 αin skin ﬁbroblasts. However, as a limitation of the present study, an experiment aiming to prove the possible causal relationship between the hydrolyzed collagen-induced TGF- βand pro-collagen-1 αwas not performed.In addition, VEGF is involved in multiple components of wound healing, including angiogenesis and, more recently, epithelialization and collagen deposition [ 23,24].Further- more, VEGF was implicated as a pivotal factor in regulating angiogenesis and inﬂammation under both physiological and pathological conditions [ 23,24].
It was demonstrated that VEGF is essential for optimal wound healing [ 23,24], which depends on ﬁbrovascular tissue formation containing ﬁbroblasts, the synthesis and deposition of collagen, and the forma- tion of new blood vessels, which are hallmarks of an established healing response [ 23,24]. Here, it was demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that hydrolyzed collagen in LPS-stimulated cells resulted in increased VEGF expression in both skin ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes.However, whether such effects may result in improved vascularization in the wound- healing process needs to be further investigated using an in vivo model.Furthermore, a synergistic effect among the growth factors, such as TGF- βand VEGF, in accelerating the healing process was demonstrated [ 25] and observed in the present study, in which hydrolyzed-collagen-induced a concomitant increase in the expression of TGF- βand VEGF.5.
Conclusions In conclusion, hydrolyzed collagen inhibited LPS-induced inﬂammation in skin ﬁbrob- lasts and keratinocytes while improving the synthesis of pro-collagen-1 αby skin ﬁbroblasts, as well as inducing the proliferation of skin ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes.
