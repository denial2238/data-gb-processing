Objective: We recently showed that insulin resistance (IR) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth with obesity are as-sociated with disordered metabolism of BCAA and diver-sion of tryptophan (TRP) metabolism from the serotoninto the kynurenine (KYN) pathway. In this study we deter-mined if BCAAs, BCKAs, Glx and KYN/TRP correlatewith metrics of obesity, insulin sensitivity, and insulin se-cretion.Methods: We performed frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) in 16 youth with normalweight and 16 non-diabetic youth with overweight/obesityand mild-moderate IR ages 18-21 yo.After an overnightfast of 8-12 hours, subjects underwent a 3-hour (1.75 g/kg,max 75 g) frequently sampled OGTT.Glucose (G) and insu-lin (I) were measured at times -15, 0, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90,120, and 180 minutes.Plasma metabolomic pro ﬁles were obtained at time 0.
HOMA-S, HOMA-B, HOMA-IR,Matsuda Index, AUC glucose, AUC insulin, insulinogenicindex (IGI) and disposition index (DI) at 10, 15 and 30min were calculated. % Body fat was measured by TANITA.Results: Groups were comparable in age (19 ±1.2 vs 19.6 ±1.1 years), sex, race, ethnicity and pubertal status.Overweight/obese participants had higher BMI (22±2.3 vs 33.7 ±8.1), BF% (19.6 ±7.2 vs 37 ±9.2), leptin, and CRP and were more insulin resistant as evidenced by high-er HOMA-IR and HOMA-B and lower HOMA-S andMatsuda Index.Glucose at 120 ’, insulin at -15 ’,0 ’,15 ’and 120 ’, and IGI at 15 ’were higher among overweight/obese subjects.AUC glucose, AUC insulin and DI were compar-able across groups, as were fasting BCAA, BCAA/BCKA ra-tio, TRP, KYN, Kynurenic acid, and the KYN/TRP ratio.BCKA levels trended lower (p =0.05) in the overweight/ obese group.
Glx levels were higher among overweight/obese subjects (p =0.03) and correlated positively with BMI, % body fat, and metrics of hepatic IR includingHOMA IR and ALT. BCAA levels correlated positivelyA740 | Journal of the Endocrine Society | https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvad114 J Endocrine Soc, Volume 7, Issue Supplement_1, October –November 2023 A740 with fasting KYN and negatively with DI at 15 ’and HMW-adiponectin, a metric of insulin sensitivity, but did not correlate with BMI or % body fat.The ratio of BCAA to BCKA correlated positively with KYN, KYN/TRP ratioand BMI.In contrast, BCKAs correlated negatively withBMI and % body fat but did not correlate with metrics of in-sulin sensitivity.KIV, the α-keto-acid of valine ,associated negatively with metrics of insulin secretion including DIand IGI at 15 ’and AUC glucose.Conclusions: In this co- hort of non-diabetic youth, the levels of Glx correlatedstrongly with body fat mass and metrics of hepatic insulinresistance.
The levels of BCAA and the ratio of BCAA/BCKA associated positively with KYN and negativelywith HMW-adiponectin, a metric of insulin sensitivity,but did not correlate with % body fat. In contrast, BCKAscorrelated negatively with % body fat and insulin secretionbut did not correlate with metrics of IR.These ﬁndings sug- gest complex effects of fat deposition and insulin sensitivityon BCAA and glutamate metabolism.Presentation: Thursday, June 15, 2023 1The University of Adelaide, North Adelaide, Australia;2La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia;3Women ’s and Children ’s Hospital, North Adelaide, Australia;4Glenside health services, Adelaide, Australia 2(21 had a BMI <85thper- centile for age and gender).Participants scored 13.7 [9.8]for depression, 13.8 [9.1] for anxiety and 17.6 [8.8] forstress.36 participants scored ≥14 and 47 participantsscored ≥10 indicating moderate levels of depression and anxiety, respectively.
For quality of life (scored out of 100 with a higher score indicating better quality of life), partic- ipants scored 68.9 [16.3] in the domain of physical function-ing, 49.5 [20.4] for emotional functioning, 75.3 [21.6] forsocial functioning and 57.8 [21.5] for school functioningwith a total average score of 63.8 [15.4] which indicatedan above average quality of life. For the PCOSQ (highestscore is 7 which indicates a higher quality of life) partici-pants scored 4.2 [1.4] for emotions, 4.0 [1.8] for body hair,3.4 [2.0] for weight, 3.9 [1.4] for menstrual problems and5.2 [1.6] for infertility problems.Higher BMI signi ﬁcantly related to lower Pediatric Quality of Life total score(r=-0.44, p <0.001) and PCOSQ for weight (r =-0.55, p<0.001), but did not impact other PCOSQ domains.BMI was not related to depression, anxiety and stress scores.Adolescents with BMI ≥85 percentile have worse total PCOSQ scores compared to those with BMI <85 percentile (3.8 (1.2) vs 4.9 (0.9), p =0.008).
Better PCOSQ for emotions signiﬁcantly related to better Pediatric Quality of Life total score (r =0.47, p <0.001) and other domains of PCOSQ (PCOSQ for body hair r =0.48, p <0.001; for weight r =0.46, p<0.001; for menstrual problems r =0.58, p <0.001 and for infertility r =0,73, p <0.001). Higher BMI was associated with reduced quality of life in adolescents recentlydiagnosed with PCOS, but other factors that impacted qual-ity of life were hirsutism, menstrual irregularities andinfertility.Journal of the Endocrine Society | https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvad114 | A741 J Endocrine Soc, Volume 7, Issue Supplement_1, October –November 2023 A741
