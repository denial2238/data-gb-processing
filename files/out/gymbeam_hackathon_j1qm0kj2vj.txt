Trial registration Trial NoPACTR2017120028 87266 (https://pactr.samrc .ac.za/). Introduction Preeclampsia isamultisystem disorder that presents with araised blood pressure and protein- uria inpregnancy [1].Globally, preeclampsia complicates approximately 2–8% ofthepregnan- cies[2].And inUganda, theincidence ofpreeclampsia is4.3% [3].The presence of convulsions with preeclampsia indicates eclampsia.Preeclampsia and eclampsia (PE/E) are life-threatening forboth themother and thefetus [4],and they areamong theleading causes ofmaternal deaths and disability worldwide, especially inthelow-resource setting [5].The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 16% ofmaternal deaths inlow-resource settings areduetoPE/E [6].Magnesium Sulphate (MgSO 4)isthedrug ofchoice forprevention and treatment ofeclampsia [6].Itisadministered parenterally byintravenous (IV) and or intramuscular (IM) routes.
The IVtherapy iscommonly administered following theZuspan regimen [7]that requires aninitial loading dose of4gmofmagnesium sulphate over 15–20 minutes, followed by1–2gmhourly maintenance dose for24hours after theloading dose or thelasteclamptic seizure. The Zuspan regimen isbest delivered byelectronic infusion pumps.These electronic pumps areexpensive and require electricity orbattery torun, making them lessappropriate inlow-resource settings.Inmany low-resource settings, MgSO 4administra- tion follows thePritchard regimen [8].The regimen isparticularly complex and requires both theIVand IMadministration ofMgSO 4.The loading dose of4gmisoften delivered using an IVpush, inwhich aclinician slowly injects magnesium sulphate with asyringe over 15–20 minutes.This isimmediately followed byIMinjection of10gmofmagnesium sulphate into thegluteal muscles (5gmoneach buttock).The maintenance dose of5gmIMinjection is administered every 4hours for24hours.
These repeated IMinjections arepainful and can increase therisk ofabscess development [9].Because ofpain associated with theIMinjection, some providers donotadminister maintenance therapy and patients toomay discontinue the maintenance dose forthesame reason. Inaddition, thePritchard regimen requires different dilutions forIVand IMdoses, and different doses forloading, and maintenance doses.This regimen requires a20% dilution ofmagnesium sulphate fortheIVloading dose, which neces- sitates thehealth providers tocalculate thequantity ofsterile water toaddtothemagnesium sulphate solution.Inmost settings, health providers donotencounter eclampsia very often; and when they do,trying toremember thecomplex regimen ischallenging [10].

GoMedical, Subaico, Australia, provided theSpringfuso rpump andflow-control tubing atareduced ratebutdidnotcontribute to thedesign oranalysis ofthestudy. Competing interests :Theauthors have declared thatnocompeting interests exist.Insettings with limited resources where electronic infusion pumps arenotaffordable, there isaneed toexplore alternative devices that caneffectively and safely deliver MgSO 4atalower cost, while also being acceptable toboth thepatient and health care provider.The Springfu- sor1 pump and flow control tube (FCT) designed byGoMedical Industries PtyLtdbased in Australia [11], isapromising alternative tothePritchard method ofadministering MgSO 4, and isdesigned tosimplify continuous IVinfusions.The Springfusor pump isaninnovative medical device that does notrequire electricity and itisreusable.Itispowered bythepotential energy stored within aspring attheheart ofthedevice.
The spring iscompressed bytheaction ofloading theSpringfusor with thecompatible syringe and FCT. The spring provides acon- stant force tothebarrel oftheloaded syringe.The FCTs aredesigned tofiteasily tothe patient’s cannula.They come indifferent flow rates, allowing theuser toachieve therequire output forprecise IVdelivery.Forourstudy weutilized twotypes ofFCT, theloading and maintenance dose.While theSpringfusor pump canbereused indefinitely onseveral patients, theFCT must bereplaced after each use.The Springfusor infusion pump issimple touseand setting up,and requires only minimal training toload and operate.Itislightweight, portable, and therefore does notlimit themobil- ityofthepatient.The Springfusor hasbeen used toadminister MgSO 4inthetreatment ofsevere preeclamp- siainIndia [12, 13].
InIndia, Mundle and colleagues compared themanually administered IV loading dose followed bymaintenance therapy given byIMroute ofadministration viaa syringe, toaloading dose and maintenance therapy given through IVinfusion administered byaSpringfusor device. Though there were nodifferences inmaternal and neonatal morbid- ity,theSpringfusor hadfewside effects [13].Later, Easterling etal.compared theSpringfusor administration ofcontinuous IVinfusion ofmagnesium sulphate and 2hourly IVboluses, the clinical findings were notdifferent inthetwogroups [12].Earlier in1994, Freebairn etal.in Australia compared theSpingfusor infusion device tointermittent boluses onadministration ofamuscle relaxant.They were able toshow that Springfusor provided amore constant level ofparalysis compared tointermittent bolus administration [14].
The objective ofthisstudy wastodemonstrate that using Springfusor pump forintravenous delivery ofmagnesium sul- phate inthetreatment ofpreeclampsia and eclampsia issafer and more acceptable than the standard ofcare. Methods The trial protocol issubmitted asasupplementary file(S2File.Protocol).The study wasaran- domized open-label clinical trial conducted atKawempe National Referral and Teaching Hos- pital inKampala district Uganda.The hospital isagovernment public facility and itsMaternal Fetal Unit admits and delivers approximately 2100 pregnant women permonth.From the facility records, 7%oftheadmissions arepreeclamptic/eclamptic women.The women with preeclampsia and eclampsia aremanaged bycadres ofhealth workers ranging from senior consultant obstetricians tomedical officers, while themidwives administer themedication and nursing care.
The study included women aged 15years and above, with apregnancy of20+ weeks ofges- tation orhadchildbirth within 24hours, presenting with preeclampsia and eclampsia i.e.,have araised blood pressure (systolic of�140 mmHg and/or diastolic�90mmHg), proteinuria�1 +.Weexcluded women who hadreceived MgSO 424hours before admission orhadknown allergy toMgSO 4and known elevated serum creatinine (>1.2 mg/dl) before enrolment. Intervention: Two hundred and forty-eight women randomized totheintervention arm (Springfusor1 group) hadtheloading and maintenance therapy ofMgSO 4using IVinfusion PLOS ONESpringfus orpump acceptabil ityformagnes iumsulphate administrat ionforpreeclamps ia PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02863 61June 12,2024 3/14 administered using aSpringfusor1 infusion pump.The loading dose was4gmof50% MgSO 4ina10mlsyringe administered over 20minutes.
The infusion rate wasdetermined by theflow control tubing calibrated todeliver 10mlofsaline over 5minutes (this system was demonstrated todeliver 4gm of50% MgSO4 in20minutes) [13]. The loading dose wasimme- diately followed bythemaintenance dose.The maintenance dose of4gmof50% MgSO 4in8 mlwasadministered over 4hours and theinfusion rate wasdetermined byasecond flow con- troltubing calibrated todeliver 10mlofsaline over 60minutes (this system wasdemonstrated todeliver 4gm of50% MgSO4 in4hours) [13].The 4-gm dose ofMgSO 4wasrepeated every 4 hourly for24hours.However, ifthe4-gm infusion wascompleted inthelessthan 4hours, the next dose wasnotstarted notuntil the4hourly interval.Two hundred forty-eight women randomized tothecontrol arm (standard ofcare) received MgSO 4administered according tothestandard hospital practice (Pritchard regimen).The loading dose of4gmof20% MgSO 4ina20mlsyringe wasadministered using anIVinfusion over 15–20 minutes.
This wasimmediately followed byanIMinjection of10gmof50% MgSO 4mixed with 1mloflignocaine into thegluteal muscles (5gmoneach buttock). This wasfollowed byamaintenance dose of5gmIMinjection, administered every 4hours for24 hours.Study procedure Between March and September 2019, women admitted toKawempe Hospital maternal-fetal unit were screened and consecutively enrolled inthestudy ifthey met theinclusion criteria.The study team obtained written informed consent from theparticipant ortherelative ifthe mother was eclamptic.However, those with eclampsia provided individual written consent later when they regained their consciousness forthem tocontinue participating inthe study.
Both arms received thecare aspernational guidelines which included management ofhigh blood pressure using antihypertensives, laboratory investigations (urine analysis, complete blood count, renal function tests, and liver function tests), prevention/treatment ofseizures and delivery asplanned bytheattending physicians. Upon enrolment, study par- ticipants were randomized tointervention orstandard ofcare arms.The study nurse assessed thetime ittook toadminister theloading and maintenance doses inboth arms using astop clock.The time was measured from theloading oftheMgSO 4into thesyringe tothecompletion ofadministration ofthemedicine inthesyringe tothepatient.Forthis paper, wereport theduration (minutes) ittook toadminister theloading dose and thesec- ond maintenance dose.The study participants’ respiratory rates were monitored bythestudy midwives every 5 minutes during theloading dose for30minutes and hourly during the24-hour maintenance dose administration.
Inaddition, urine output and tendon reflexes were monitored hourly and documented inthesource documents. The side effects ofMgSO 4likenausea, vomiting, flushing oftheskin, muscle weakness, confusion, and drowsiness were reported 4hourly and were captured inaquestionnaire.The study participants were followed tilldischarge from the hospital and pregnancy outcomes were extracted from theparticipants’ records orcharts.The primary outcome wasacceptability ofthemethod ofMgSO 4administration assessed using aLikert scale (1–5; 1:acceptable and 5:unacceptable).The questionnaire wasadminis- tered after thelastmaintenance dose.The method ofMgSO 4administration wasregarded acceptable iftheparticipant rated it1or2,and wasunacceptable iftheparticipant scored it3 ormore.Women who discontinued themethod ofadministration bychoice orduetoside effects were considered inthegroup oftheunacceptable.
The secondary outcomes were pain during administration, complications experienced, discontinuation and reliability ofthe PLOS ONESpringfus orpump acceptabil ityformagnes iumsulphate administrat ionforpreeclamps ia PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02863 61June 12,2024 4/14 Springfusor todeliver theMgSO 4asplanned. The level ofpain experienced during administra- tion ofMgSO 4wasassessed immediately after thelastdose ofMgSO 4using avisual analogue scale 1–7[13], theleast (one) representing nopain and themaximum (7)representing the worst pain imaginable.The complications intwoarms were measured astheproportion of preeclamptic women who developed anyoneofthefollowing; MgSO 4toxicity, abnormal liver and renal function testasreported bythelaboratory report, aninfection attheinjection as reported bytheclinician oramaternal death.The discontinuation rate wasassessed asstudy participants who didnotcomplete therecommended doses ofMgSO 4in24-hour period.
Par- ticipants who discontinued themethod ofadministration bychoice, duetoside effects, orby health worker’s decision were counted ineach group. And lastly, reliability ofSpringfusor1 pump inthedelivery ofMgSO 4wasmeasured asthetime taken bythedevice todeliver the MgSO 4aspertheclinical recommendations.Sample size, randomisation and statistical analysis The sample sizewascalculated based ontheprimary end-point (the proportion ofwomen who reported administration ofMgSO 4wasacceptable.Tocalculate thesample size, atwo- sided significant level of5%and power of90% were chosen.Based onthecurrent literature, theacceptability ofMgSO 4administration using thePritchard regimen (IM maintenance) in theMundle etal.trial was31% [13].Todetect anabsolute increase of50percent points inthe proportion ofwomen who reported administration ofmgso4 wasacceptable between those who used Springfusor and those who used standard ofcare, weneed tohave asample sizeof 241ineach arm.
Randomization wasperformed byabiostatistician notinvolved intheclinical trial who developed theallocation sequence using anonline computer random number generator in block sizes of4and 6.The allocation sequence wasconcealed from theresearch team enrolling and screening participants inserially numbered sealed opaque envelopes (concealed alloca- tion) containing therandomization group. After theresearch nurse hadobtained theconsent, sheopened thenext envelope todetermine thegroup assignment only after theparticipant wasenrolled, completed thebaseline assessment and itwastime toallocate theintervention.Because ofthenature ofthestudy, itwasdifficult toblind theimplementation oftheallocation and measurement oftheoutcome.Acceptability and safety data were evaluated using intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.
The analysis wasconducted using Stata version 12.Descriptive statistics (frequencies, means (stan- dard deviation), median, and ranges) were used tosummarize baseline characteristics ofstudy participants and assess ifrandomization wassuccessful. Student’s t-test wasperformed tocom- pare variables that followed aGaussian distribution.The Chi-square testwasused toevaluate theassociation between twocategorical variables.The Mann Whitney-Wilcoxon testwasused tocompare themedian scores between thetwogroups.The statistically significant wassetat p<0.05.Ethical considerations Approval forthisresearch wasprovided bytheMakerere University School ofMedicine Research and Ethics Committee (REC Ref2018–015) and theUganda National Council for Science and Technology (HS 2365).Study participants provided written informed consent.The trial wasregistered with Pan African Clinical Trails PACTR201712002887 266.

More than two-thirds ofparticipants were patients referred from lower facilities. Table 2shows thelaboratory parameters ofthestudy participants enrolled inthecontrol and intervention arms.The baseline laboratory parameters were similar inthetwogroups with theexception forelevated serum creatinine intheintervention arm.Asshown inTable 3,almost allwomen intheintervention group found Springfusor admin- istration ofMgSO 4acceptable (95.3%, CI:91.2–97.1) compared tothestandard ofcare (70.3%, CI:64.3–75.9) and p<0.001.The women inthestandard ofcare arm hadahigher median pain score than theintervention arm (standard ofcare: 4(IQR: 4–5); Springfusor: 2(IQR: 2–2), p<0.001).More women intheintervention arm would recommend Springfusor method of administration ofMgSO 4toafriend compared tostandard ofcare (96.2% vs61.4%, p<0.001).
Similarly, almost allwomen intheintervention arm would usetheSpringfusor formagnesium administration when they have raised blood pressure inthenext pregnancy compared tothe control arm (Pritchard method) (95.7% vs65.7%, p<0.001). The duration ofMgSO 4administration ofloading dose waslonger inthestandard ofcare than inSpringfusor arm (Table 4).Few women inboth groups discontinued MgSO 4(did not complete therecommended 24-hour doses) and therates were similar (5.3% vs5.0% p=0.862).Table 2.Laboratory characterist icsoftheparticipa ntsenrolled into thestudy.

The Springfusor pump applies constant pressure toa syringe using asimple spring mechanism. The infusion rate isdetermined byaspecifi cFCT, which provides consistent resistance toproduce a steady flow.The FCT fortheloading dose delivers 4grams of50% MgSO4 over 20minutes, while theoneformaintenan cedose administra tion delivers 4grams of50% MgSO4 over 4hours.https://doi.org/10 .1371/journal.p one.0286361.g002 PLOS ONESpringfus orpump acceptabil ityformagnes iumsulphate administrat ionforpreeclamps ia PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02863 61June 12,2024 10/14 eclampsia.MgSO 4istheanticonvulsant foreclampsia prophylaxis and treatment [16].MgSO 4 therapy could begiven bycontinuous IVinfusion (Zuspan) [7]orbyadministering anIV bolus and IMdoses fortheloading dose followed byIMinjections every 4hours (Pritchard) [8].Inlow-resource settings duetounavailability oftheelectronic pumps, thePritchard regi- men isthestandard ofcare.
The loading dose of4gm ofMgSO 4isoften delivered viaanIV push over 15–20 minutes. This process ischallenging fortheprovider and difficult inabusy ward, and isassociated with inconsistent flow rates.Ifadministered faster than therecom- mended 15–20 minutes, theIVpush may lead toincreased pain, nausea, vomiting, and flush- ing.Meanwhile, therepeated IMinjections that follow theloading dose areassociated with pain, hotflushes, somnolence, and sometimes abscess formation atthesiteofinjection.Weassessed theacceptability and safety ofSpringfusor pump forintravenous delivery of MgSO 4forprophylaxis and treatment ofeclampsia among women admitted atKawempe National Referral Hospital.Acceptability ofintravenous administration ofMgSO 4using Springfusor washigher compared tothePritchard regimen (standard ofcare).The level of acceptability ofintravenous administration ofMgSO 4using Springfusor wascomparable toa study byMundle etalinIndia that found that itwas97% [13].
The lowacceptability associated with standard ofcare ismost likely duetopain that follows IMinjection. Literature shows that theanxiety and fear associated with pain following IMinjection reduces theacceptability of treatment tothepatients [17, 18].With thefour-hourly frequency ofIMinjection ofMgSO 4 forprophylaxis and treatment ofpreeclampsia and eclampsia instandard ofcare, injection site pain isanimportant concern and local guidelines propose addition ofalocal anesthetic agent (Lignocaine) into thedrug.Despite theaddition of1mloflignocaine into every IMinjection ofMgSO 4,ourstudy findings showed that participants onthestandard ofcare experienced higher pain scores than women who received thedrug intravenous, administered bythe Springfusor pump.The majority (96%) oftheparticipants intheintervention arm responded that they would recommend IVmagnesium sulfate administered using Springfusor toother patients compared tostandard ofcare (61%).
Inaddition, almost allparticipants inintervention arm (97%) Fig3.Showing participant with Springfus orpump with magnesium sulphate adminis tered through acannula. The neck suspension string onthepatient’s neck enables participants mobility without fear ofdislodg ingthecannula.https://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0286361.g0 03 PLOS ONESpringfus orpump acceptabil ityformagnes iumsulphate administrat ionforpreeclamps ia PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02863 61June 12,2024 11/14 compared totwo-thirds (66%) instandard ofcare would useMgSO 4infuture pregnancy if they getpreeclampsia.Literature reports that, when thesafety and efficacy oftwoinjection routes areequivalent, health care providers should consider more about patient’s preference because itwillensure optimal treatment adherence and ultimately improve patient’s experi- ence orsatisfaction [19, 20].
Inourstudy, findings showed that nowomen developed aseizure after enrolment, indicating that both routes and dosing prevented and controlled theconvul- sions adequately. Overall, thediscontinuation rate waslow(5.1%) and there wasnodifference inthetwo arms.The lowrates ofdiscontinuation could bebecause thisassessment wasamong partici- pants who participated inaresearch study environment which hasample opportunities for questions, comments, and explanations oftheprocess.Intherealworld, itisunlikely that this level ofsupport willbeavailable.Slightly more than half (56%) ofthediscontinuation wasdue tophysician onduty recommendation.The other reasons fordiscontinuation were duetopar- ticipant’s requests (32%), and three patients (12%) were referred toseek treatment inanother facility before completion ofthedrug administration.
The Springfusor1 pump and flow control tube (FCT) isanencouraging alternative to repeated IMadministration ofMgSO 4,designed tomake simpler, thecontinuous IVinfusions. Itdoes notrequire electricity and itisreusable.The Springfusor ispowered bythepotential energy stored within aspring attheheart ofthedevice (Fig 2),suitable forlow-resource settings.The FCTs exist inavariety offlow rates which enables theuser toattain thedesired output forexact IVdelivery needs.Forthisstudy weused twovarieties ofFCTs asshown inFig2;the loading dose and maintenance dose.The Springfusor syringe infusion pump isalow-cost tech- nology that requires only minimal training toload and operate.Being lightweight, and with a neck strap, itdoes notlimit themobility ofthepatient (Fig 3).This study hadsome limitations.Firstly, thedelay inaccessing thelaboratory work ofthe participants resulted insome participants who should beexcluded based onserum creatinine, enrolled inthestudy.
Due tothemorbidity and mortality associated with PE/E, thestandard ofcare atthefacility does notwait forlaboratory results before starting MgSO 4prophylaxis. Weoperated within thehospital guidelines.Fortunately, noparticipant experienced MgSO 4 toxicity.Secondly, wecould notblind thestudy totheparticipants and providers, and might have influenced thereporting oftheoutcomes.The nature ofthestudy could notenable blind- ingofthestudy.Conclusion Acceptance ofprescribed therapy iskeyforadherence and toclinical outcomes, and theeffect isparticularly critical fortreatments that require repeated injections likeMgSO 4forpre- eclampsia and eclampsia.Pain associated with intramuscular injection (standard ofcare) was lesswith theintravenous infusion (Springfusor1) than with intramuscular administration.In addition, theintravenous administration waspreferred tothestandard ofcare with women endorsing agreater likelihood touseitinthenext pregnancy orrecommend ittoafriend.
