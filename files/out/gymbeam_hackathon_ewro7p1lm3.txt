Finally, we employed the subgrou p analysis to further investigate the relationship between dietary vitamin E intak e and PD. Results: Accordingtotheweightedunivariateandmultivariablelogisti cregression analysis, vitamin E intake was inversely associated with the ri sk of PD before and after matching.The results of RCS analysis revealed no non -linear inverse relationship between vitamin E intake and PD before and after m atching.The subgroup analysis showed that age may inﬂuence the negative ass ociation between vitamin E and PD ( P</zero.tnum./zero.tnum/five.tnum for interaction).Conclusion: Among participants over /four.tnum/zero.tnum years of age, vitamin E intake was negatively associated with the risk of PD.Our data may suppor t the supplementation of vitamin E to be used as an intervention str ategy for the occurrence of PD.
KEYWORDS Parkinson’s disease (PD), vitamin E intake, propensity score m atching (PSM), the national healthand nutritional examination surveys (NHANES),dietary Introduction Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disease, it is estimated that millions of people around the world has been aﬀected by PD ( 1). Another study suggests that PD aﬀects roughly 1% of people over 60 years ( 2).As the world population aging, PD prevalence will double in the next 2 decades ( 3).Many factors, Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.org Hao et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/two.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum including genes, environment and age, etc, play an important role in the pathogenesis and disease progression of PD ( 2).Studies have shown that neurological and nutritional factors may interact each other ( 4,5).
The main pathological characteristic of PD is the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the formation of Lewy bodies in substantia nigra, which involves abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein ( α-syn), neuroinﬂammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, etc ( 6,7). When dopamine is released from synaptic vesicles into the cytosol or synaptic cleft, a large number of oxidants are produced in enzymatic and non-enzymaticreactions,sodopaminergicneuronsareparticularly susceptible to oxidative stress ( 8).Antioxidants in food were found to be neuroprotective, strengthening antioxidant pathways to counteracting neurodegenerative disease, such as PD ( 9,10).However, the association between the progression of PD and the intakeofvitaminsremainsunclear.Vitamin E is an antioxidant and inhibits lipid peroxidation.Likewise, vitamin E is the only lipid-soluble chain-breaking antioxidant in human erythrocyte membranes and plasma ( 11, 12).
Therefore, vitamin E may play an important role in the treatment of PD related to oxidative stress. Vitamin E is a group of compounds consisting of four tocotrienol (TT)- and four tocopherol (TP)-derivatives ( 13).TPs act as antioxidants by free radical scavenging and increasing the activity of antioxidant enzyme (14,15).Certain TPs and TTs utilize various disturbances of the cellular and humoral immune systems to exert anti- inﬂammatory eﬀects ( 16).Vitamin E compounds have indirect neuroprotective eﬀects in PD due to neurotoxic potential of inﬂammation and oxidative stress.A clinical retrospective analysis shows that vitamin E levels in healthy participants are higher than those in PD patients ( 17).Despite numerous studies indicating that increased vitamin E intake is linked to a decreased risk of PD, a prospective clinical trial with PD patients found no evidence of vitamin E serving as an additional therapy ( 18, 19).
There is controversy regarding the association between vitamin E intake and PD pathogenesis. Thus, we consider that the relationship between vitamin E and PD risk deserves furtherinvestigation.Therefore, based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database (NHANES), we investigated the associationbetweendietaryvitaminEintakeandPDbyexamining 13,340 participants from 2009 to 2018.The cross-sectional study canbeusedasareferenceforthepreventionofPD.Methods Database and survey populations In this study, data were come from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey website ( https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm ).We collected publicly available NHANES’s data from 2009 to 2018.A total of the sample of 13,340 participants were included in main analyses.Those who are under 40 years old were excluded.
The integration process of entire data is shown in Figure1.Study criteria of Parkinson’s disease In the NHANES database, we identiﬁed the participants as PD by using “Anti-Parkinson agents” ( 20,21). This determination was made based on the responses to questions about prescription medication.This way of identiﬁcation is aﬀected by the medications and codes included in the NHANES that participants must be treated for PD to be identiﬁed with PD, and those who do not receive treatment were classiﬁed as not havingPD.Dietary vitamin E intake measurement Based on the data from the NHANES database, two recall interviews were conducted with the participants.Data on dietary vitamin E intake were collected through two 24-h recall interviews.The ﬁrst interview was conducted at the NHANES mobile testing, while in the second recall interview, respondents were asked to complete 3–10 days of telephone interviews.
To reduce errors in collecting dietary intake data, we took the average of the dietary intake data from these two interviews as the dietary vitamin E intake. It is worth noting that dietary vitamin E intake was only derived from food intake data and does not include the use ofsupplements.Assessment of covariates In this study, demographic covariates included age, gender, race, marital status and education level.Chronic comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which were conﬁrmed by professional doctor diagnosis or a self-report questionnaire.Other potential factors included body mass index (BMI), energy intake, smoking status and alcohol status.BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2) by well-trained health technologists.The details of relevant deﬁnitions were shown in the Supplementarymaterial .
Statistical analysis To account for the complexities of the sampling survey, weighted analyses were conducted following the guidelines outlined by the NHANES. For categorical variables, frequency and percentages were reported, while for continuous variables, the mean and standard error (SE) were reported.We used chi- square tests to compare categorical variables, while we used a T -test to analyze the baseline characteristics of continuous variables.Propensity score matching (PSM) as a method can minimize the eﬀects of possible biases and confounding variables in observational studies.In this study, confounding factors, including age, gender, race, hypertension and CVD, were used to matching.As shown in Figure2, we used a 1:2 rule in the PSM method to balance cases and controls.Univariate and three Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org Hao et al.

We also conducted subgroup analyses based on age (40–50, 50–60, and ≥60 years), gender (male or female), race (Mexican American, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, other Hispanic, and other races), marital Status (non-single and single), education level (less than high school, high school, high school above), energy intake (tertile 1, T1; tertile 2, T2; tertile 3, T3), BMI ( ≤18.5, 18.5–25, 25–30 or ≥30 kg/m2), smoking status(never,former,andnow),alcoholstatus(never,former,mild, moderate, and heavy), hypertension (no/yes), diabetes (no/yes), and CVD (no/yes) before and after PSM.

Characteristics of included participants after matching by PD A comparison control group was established using closest- neighbor PSM (1:2) to analyze the relationship between the intake of vitamin E and the risk of PD. After PSM, data set included 364 participants in the control group and 182 participants in the PD group is show in Table2.There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in other covariates, while the signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the PD andnon-PDgroupsindietaryvitaminEintakemean(SE)with7.05 (0.38)and8.99(0.38)( P<0.001)aftermatching.Association analysis of dietary vitamin E intake and PD before and after matching Univariate logistics regression analysis of the association between dietary vitamin E intake and PD before and after matching We use univariate logistics analysis to observe the association between the vitamin E, other covariates and PD.
As shown in Table3, age was positively correlated with PD occurrence and the eﬀect value odds ratio (OR) and 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) was 1.03 (1.01, 1.05) ( P=0.0014). Compared with male, female developing PD was a higher likelihood with an OR (95%) of 1.68 (1.17, 2.43) ( P=0.0068).People who had had hypertension, CVD hadahigherriskofPDwithaORand95%CIof1.51(1.03,2.21)( P =0.0368)and1.98(1.31,2.99)( P=0.0016),respectively.Themost important is that dietary vitamin E intake was inversely associated withPDoccurrencebeforeandaftermatching.TheOR(95%CI)of PDfordietaryvitaminEintakewas0.91(0.87,0.96)( P=0.0011).Multivariable logistics regression analysis of the relationship between vitamin E intake and PD before and after matching Asshownin Table4,threelogisticregressionmodelswereused to investigate the connection between vitamin E intake and PD.
Two adjusted models included: model 1 was adjusted for age, sex, race while model 2 was adjusted for age, sex, race marital status, education level, smoke, drinking, BMI, hypertension, diabetes,CVD and energy intake. There are all models displayed signiﬁcant disparities before and after matching.Our results imply that vitamin E intake is closely connected with the occurrence of PD withORand95%CIof0.91(0.87,0.96),0.92(0.87,0.97),and0.89 (0.84,0.95)( P<0.05)beforematching.Thesigniﬁcantassociation between vitamin E intake and PD occurrence was still observed after matching, which indicate that dietary vitamin E intake was inversely associated with the risk of PD and increasing dietary vitaminEintakecouldpreventPD.Non-linear relationship between dietary vitamin E intake and the risk of PD As evident in Figure3, we used the restricted cubic spline RCS to visually describe the connection between vitamin E and PD before and after matching.
Theresults of analysis revealed nonon- linearinverserelationshipbetweenvitaminEintakeandPDbefore and after matching. The OR of PD decreased when the dietary vitaminEintakeincreased.Subgroup analysis before and after matching Inthisstudy,weemployedsubgroupanalysistoverifywhether the relationship between vitamin E Intake and PD are aﬀected by age, gender, race, marital status, education, energy intake, BMI, smoke, drinking, hypertension, diabetes, and CVD.As shown in Figures4,5, age could aﬀect the negative association between dietary vitamin E intake and PD before and after PSM ( Pfor interaction <0.05).People aged 40–50 and over 60 had a strong relationship between vitamin E intake and PD before and after matching ( P<0.05).Generally speaking, the consistent results are considered to be reliable that before and after PSM matching.Therefore, the subgroup analysis shows that vitamin E intake was a signiﬁcant protective factor in people who were aged 40–50 or over60years.
Discussion VitaminEisanessentialnutrientforthehumanbodilyfunction (24). However, the association between vitamin E and PD remains unclear.It is necessary for us to investigate the relationship.According to the above, we conduct a cross-sectional study to examine the association between dietary vitamin E intake and PD.To reduce the eﬀects of selection bias and confounding variables, weutilizedPSM.Theunivariateandmultivariatelogisticregression showed that dietary vitamin E intake was inversely associated with the risk of PD.And RCS analysis revealed that the relationship betweenvitaminEintakeandPDriskwasnonon-linear.Vitamin E, as an antioxidant, can decrease the levels of oxygen-derivedfreeradicalsinneuraltissueandregulateglutamate neurotoxicity to protect the brain ( 25).There are established diagnostic standards for the vitamin E deﬁciency of PD that are simple to administer.

E can prevent detrimental eﬀects of lipid peroxidation (LPO), eliminate free radicals generated by metabolism to safeguard cells.Likewise, adding vitamin E as a supplement can also improve motor deﬁcits to enhance the quality of life for PD patients.Furthermore, a clinical retrospective analysis reveals that the levels of vitamin E are signiﬁcantly higher in healthyindividuals compared to age- and sex-matched 193 PD patients (17).A meta-analysis conducted in 2022 indicated a signiﬁcant inverse association between increased vitamin E intake and the risk of developing PD, compared to individuals with lower vitamin E intake ( 30).In clinical trials, vitamin E therapy has shown potential in slowing down the progression of degenerative Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/eight.tnum frontiersin.org Hao et al.

Vitamin E has the potential to Frontiersin Nutrition /one.tnum/zero.tnum frontiersin.org Hao et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/two.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum act as a substitute for the protective enzymes lacking in nigrka andlocuscoeruleus(LC)neurons.Furthermore,pretreatmentwith tocopherolhasbeenshowntomitigatethetoxiceﬀectsof6-OHDA on the LC ( 38).Comparing to the rotenone induced model of PD, the increased number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) - positive neurons observed after pretreatment with a high dose of vitamin E can be attributed to its neuroprotective eﬀect ( 39).
Likewise, certain data analyses suggest that the reduction in apomorphine induced rotational behavior in rats may be attributed to the preventive eﬀect of the vitamin on 6-OHDA induced dopamine depletion ( 40). The immunohistochemical analyses of TH in the studyhaveshownthatthereductioninthenumberofLCcellswas smaller in the vitamin E pretreated lesioned group compared to thelesionedgroup( 28).Lipidperoxidationcanresultinmembrane damage,andvitaminE,beinglipidsoluble,actsasachain-breaking antioxidantinbiologicalmembranes.Bycapturingthefreeradicals, vitamin E protects biological membranes from potential damage caused by these reactive species ( 41).It averts cellular damage by binding to free radicals and neutralizing their unpaired electrons, which is then converted to α-tocopherylquinone ( 39).There have been several pharmacological studies that primarily investigate the association between tocopherol derivatives (Toco-D) and PD.
These studies suggest that Toco-D can improve catalepsy and locomotion by increasing the concentration of dopamine in the substantianigra.Additionally,Toco-Dmayreduceoxidativestress levels and enhance neurotransmission to alleviate symptoms. Furthermore,itisspeculatedthatToco-Dcaninhibitinﬂammation by decreasing NF- κB levels in the brain, which could be one of the reasonscontributingtothealleviationofPD( 27).An analysis was performed to investigate the non-linear association between variables and results.According to RCS analysis,thereseemstobeanassociationbetweentheconsumption of vitamin E in one’s diet and the development of PD.Speciﬁcally, as the intake of vitamin E increases, the OR of developing PD decreases.Within a speciﬁc range of variation, vitamin E intake may serve as a protective factor for PD.Additionally, subgroup analysis demonstrated that individuals who were aged 40–50 and over 60 years exhibited dietary vitamin E intake as a protective factor.
As a result of our study, we suggest that people take in foods rich in vitamin E, like the Mediterranean diet to prevent and treatPD. Our study oﬀers several notable advantages and implications.It is worth noting that it based on NHANES, which enhances credibility and ensures strong representativeness.Secondly, by employing PSM, we eﬀectively reduce selection bias and enhance the credibility of our ﬁndings, thereby strengthening causal arguments and eliminating confounding factors often present in observational studies.Thirdly, through the utilization of RCS analysis, we were able to demonstrate the absence of no non- linear associations between dietary vitamin E intake and PD.Additionally, we conducted subgroup analysis to further explore the relationship between vitamin E and PD across diﬀerent population groups.However, this study still has some limitations.
In the ﬁrst place, the data base we used which deﬁned PD by the use of anti-Parkinson’s drugs rather than a clinical diagnosis by professionals.TheinclusionofindividualswithmildPDsymptoms in the healthy subjects group, as they may not require medication,and the inclusion of individuals with other neurological disorders in the PD group due to their use of Parkinson’s drugs, can introduce bias in the analysis results. Given the cross-sectional design of our study, it is noted that no causal inferences can be made.Additionally, the presence of unidentiﬁed confounders may still have an impact, limiting the interpretation of our ﬁndings.Therefore, further prospective clinical studies are necessary to elucidatetheintricaterelationshipbetweendietaryvitaminEintake andPD.Conclusion In summary, the ﬁndings of this study indicate that a higher vitamin E intake is linked to a reduced risk of PD to some extent.
Additionally, the relationship between dietary vitamin E intake and PD risk exhibit no non-linearity. Considering the growing prevalence of PD and the potential neuroprotective properties of vitamin E, this discovery holds signiﬁcant implications for both public health and clinical practice.It suggests that ensuring suﬃcient dietary vitamin E levels could be crucial in lowering the risk of Parkinson’s disease.However, more extensive research is necessary to unravel the underlying mechanisms and thoroughly investigate the potential advantages and drawbacks of dietary vitaminEsupplementation.Data availability statement The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.This data can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ nhanes/index.htm .Ethics statement Thestudywasconductedinadherencetotheethicalprinciples outlinedintheWorldMedicalAssociationDeclarationofHelsinki.Prior to the interview and examination, all participants provided informedconsent.
