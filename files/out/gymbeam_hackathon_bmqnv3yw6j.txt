RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Creatine supplementation and oxidative stress in rat liver Michel B Araújo1*, Leandro P Moura1, Roberto C Vieira Junior2, Marcelo C Junior1, Rodrigo A Dalia1, Amanda C Sponton1, Carla Ribeiro1and Maria Alice R Mello1 Abstract Background: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of creatine supplementation on liver biomarkers of oxidative stress in exercise-trained rats.Methods: Forty 90-day-old adult male Wistar rats were assigned to four groups for the eight-week experiment.Control group (C) rats received a balanced control diet; creatine control group (CCr) rats received a balanced diet supplemented with 2% creatine; trained group (T) rats received a balanced diet and intense exercise trainingequivalent to the maximal lactate steady state phase; and supplemented-trained (TCr) rats were given a balanced diet supplemented with 2% creatine and subjected to intense exercise training equivalent to the maximal lactate steady state phase.
At the end of the experimental period, concentrations of creatine, hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured as well as the enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-GPx) and catalase (CAT). Liver tissue levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and the GSH/GSSG ratio were also determined.Results: Hepatic creatine levels were highest in the CCr and TCr groups with increased concentration of H 2O2 observed in the T and TCr animal groups.SOD activity was decreased in the TCr group.GSH-GPx activity was increased in the T and TCr groups while CAT was elevated in the CCr and TCr groups.GSH, GGS and the GSH/GSSGratio did not differ between all animal subsets.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that creatine supplementation acts in an additive manner to physical training to raise antioxidant enzymes in rat liver.
However, because markers of liver oxidative stress were unchanged, this findingmay also indicate that training-induced oxidative stress cannot be ameliorated by creatine supplementation. Keywords: Creatine supplementation, Oxidative stress, Enzymes, Treadmill exercise Background Physical activity modifies the balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant defense mechanisms.For both ath-letes and fitness enthusiasts, the combination of regular physical activity and antioxidant supplementation may have important restorative effects on the body ’s oxidation- reduction or redox balance.Dietary supplementation with creatine (CrS) is popular in the sports and fitness industry, wherein CrS is be-lieved to aid in the maintenance of high-energy phos- phate reserves during exercise.
While certain mechanismsof action involved in improved physical exercise perform- ance with CrS have been established [1,2], recent research efforts have focused on other CrS benefits, specifically, theuse of CrS in reducing the cellular oxidative stress associ- ated with strenuous long-term exercise [3-5]. Creatine is an end-product of the metabolism of amino acids glycineand arginine, producing guanidinoacetate and participat- ing in the urea cycle.Arginine also acts as a substrate in the nitric oxide synthase pathway and can stimulate theproduction of nitric oxide free radicals that modulate skel- etal muscle and liver metabolism, contractility and glucose uptake [6-8].Certain amino acids such as hi stidine, methionine and cysteine are particularly susceptible to oxidation by free rad- icals [9].

The antioxidant effects of creatine may derive from dif- ferent mechanisms of action such as the indirect me- chanisms involved in cell membrane stabilization andimproved cellular energy capacity [11] and from its direct antioxidant properties [5]. Recently, creatine ’s potential to act directly to remove reactive oxygen species was investi-gated [12].Lawler et al.[5] concluded that creatine has a significant role as a primary antioxidant.Using in vitro techniques, these authors found a dose-response relation-ship between creatine concentration and the ability to re- move superoxide anions (O 2-) and peroxynitrite (OONO).As creatine has not shown significant antioxidant activityagainst hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), these findings also demonstrate creatine ’s selective antioxidant capacity.Sestili et al.[4] postulated a direct antioxidant role for creatine in cells exposed to various oxidative agents.
These authors demonstrated that creatine in doses similar to those found in plasma after supplementation exerts cyto-protective antioxidant activity in three different cell lines against three different oxidative agents: H 2O2, OONO- and t-butyl hydroperoxide (tB-OOH), an organic peroxide widely used in a variety of oxidation processes. Further- more, cytoprotection was observed independent of the anti-oxidative state of the cell, as evaluated by the antioxi-dant enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which suggests a direct interaction between creatine and oxidiz- ing agents and/or free radicals.In humans, creatine synthesis appears to occur mainly in the liver [13], an organ that requires vast amounts of generated energy to perform its various functions.Thehigh metabolic rate of the liver (200 kcal/kg of tissue per day) is directly associated with the high flow of electrons in the mitochondrial respiratory chain [14].
However,some of these electrons are diverted to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several authors have demonstrated that the liver undergoes increased oxidative stress follow-ing exercise [14,15].Thus, we sought to investigate the effects of CrS on oxi- dative balance, injury and liver antioxidant defense mecha- nisms during exercise in a laboratory model.The aims of this study were to: 1) determine whether creatine supple-mentation increased liver creatine stores and 2) determine whether creatine supplementation improved markers of liver oxidative stress following exercise training.Methods Animals and treatment Forty 90-day-old male Wistar rats were given free accessto water and food.The animals were housed in collect- ive polyethylene cages measuring 37.0 × 31.0 × 16.0 cm with 5 animals per cage, all under controlled conditionsof temperature (22°C) and light/dark cycle (12 h/12 h).
The experiment was submitted to and approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee at the Uni-versity of Taubaté - UNITAU, São Paulo State, Brazil (register CEEA / UNITAU nº 018/08). Exercise training was performed and creatine supple- mentation given over eight weeks with animals allocated into four groups of ten animals in each group: control group (C), sedentary rats that received a balanced con-trol diet; creatine control group (CCr), sedentary rats that received a balanced diet supplemented with 2% cre- atine; trained group (T), rats that were subjected to atraining protocol and received a balanced diet; and sup- plemented trained group (TCr), rats that were subjected to a training protocol and received a balanced diet sup-plemented with 2% creatine.Diet The animals in the creatine-supplemented groups (CCr and TCr) received the balanced, isocaloric AIN-93 M diet [16] supplemented with 13% or 2% monohydratedcreatine (All Chemistry, São Paulo, SP , Brazil) [17].
According to Hutman et al. [18] and Vandenbergue et al.[19] creatine supplementation must be provided intwo phases, which aims to promote an overload state of this substrate.These phases were designated as a first peak phase and a subsequent maintenance phase.Duringthe peak phase, rats received the 13% creatine diets for seven days followed by a maintenance phase for the remaining days of the experiment during which ratswere fed a 2% creatine diet.We used the dosage of cre- atine based on dose for human but there was an adjust- ment for employment with the animals.The addition of2% in diet creatine during the maintenance phase equals 20 g.kg-1 peak in the phase of 13% were used equivalent to 130 g.kg-1.Still, according to Altman and Dittmer[20], sets the speed rat metabolism is 5 times greater than the human being for this reason these present values of creatine supplementation.
Thus, animals thatreceived creatine-supplemented feed were supplemented seven days a week for eight weeks of the experiment. The animals from groups C and T received the bal- anced isocaloric diet AIN-93 M [16] without addition of creatine.The detailed diet composition is provided in Table 1.Training protocol To determine the Maximum Lactate Steady State (MLSS),series of exercises was performed, rats bearing rectangular loads ran for 25 minutes on a treadmill at different fixed speeds for each series and a 48-hour interval betweenseries.Blood sample was obtained every five minutes for lactate measurement and were taken from a small incision at the end of the tail that was made prior to the beginningAraújo et al.Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2013, 10:54 Page 2 of 8 http://www.jissn.com/content/10/1/54 of exercise and was sufficient for all specimen collections.
The blood lactate concentration representative of the MLSS was considered that obtained from the highest speed where there was no variation in blood lactate be-tween 10 and 25 min of exercise was no greater than 1.0 mmol/L [10,20]. The blood lactate concentration was de- termined by an enzymatic method [21].The average MLSS for all rats was 26 m/min.Thus, all rats were trained at this intensity for 40 minutes/day, five days/week for the duration of the experiment.Biochemical analysis Animals were sacrificed after anesthesia with CO 2at the conclusion of the experiment in the fed state and 48 hours after the last “in vivo ”evaluation.Blood, liver and gastrocnemius muscle were removed for creatine meas- urement as described by Clark [22].As biomarkers of oxidative stress, H 2O2was determined as hydrogen per- oxide (Amplex UltraRed Reagent® kit, Life Technologies Corporation, Grand Island, New York, USA) and thio- barbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) [23] were also evaluated.
As indicators of the antioxidant system, enzymatic ac- tivity was analyzed for superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Cayman Chemical commercial kit, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-GPx) (Cayman Chem-ical commercial kit, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) and cata- lase (CAT) [24]. Glutathione, both reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG), were analyzed according to the methodof Hissin and Hilf [25].Statistical analysis The normality of the data was confirmed by the Shapiro-Wilks test.The results are presented as the mean ± S.E.(standard error).Comparisons between groups were made through an analysis of variance (ANOVA Two-Way )a n d the Tukey HSD post-hoc test when necessary.A predeter-mined 5% significance level was used for all the analyses.The statistical program used was the STATISTICA®, ver- sion 7.0.
Results Creatine concentration in the liver Animals supplemented with creatine showed significant increase in hepatic creatine concentration when were compared to animals that received no supplementation(Figure 1). Concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver Liver H 2O2levels obtained at the end of the experiment were significantly increased in the exercise-trained groups T and TCr in relation to control groups C and CCr (Figure 2A).The values for hepatic TBARS at the end of experi- ment did not differ between groups (Figure 2B).Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-GPx) and catalase (CAT) in the liver Hepatic SOD activity at the end of the experiment showed decreased activity in rats from the TCr group when they were compared with rats from CCr group (Figure 3A).

Several studies have confirmed these effects and pointed to cre- atine as a new alternative in the prevention of oxidativestress in which creatine appears to play a crucial role in reducing the toxic effects of endogenous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [5,26-28].The literature indicates that 2% CrS in animal feed is able to trigger a significant increase in phosphocreatine (PCr) and creatine levels in rat tissues [29,30]. Using thisamount of creatine, McMillen et al.[30] observed a sig- nificant increase in the total creatine content of rat gastro- cnemius muscle in two weeks of supplementation.In thepresent study, significant increase in the hepatic creatine concentrations were demonstrated in CCr and TCr rats compared to the non-supplemented control groups, whichsupports prior findings in the literature [30,31].
After confirming that dietary supplementation increased creatine concentration in rat liver, this study aimed toevaluate the possible antioxidant effects of CrS in vivo. The results demonstrate that creatine exerts indirect anti- oxidant activity in rat liver, i.e., creatine increased theactivity of antioxidant enzymes GSH-GPx and CAT.How- ever, CrS was not effective in normalizing the increased concentrations of H 2O2triggered by exercise.In addition, no significant differences were observed in the concentra- tion of TBARS between groups.H2O2plays an important role in homeostasis.It partici- pates in cellular induction of gene expression, among which are those genes responsible for antioxidant enzyme synthesis [32-34].

The results are expressed as the mean + S.E.of 10 animals per group.TCr = Trained Creatine; T = Trained; CCr = Control Creatine; C = Control not trained.Araújo et al.Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2013, 10:54 Page 5 of 8 http://www.jissn.com/content/10/1/54 that exercise-trained rats (T and TCr) had higher concen- trations of H 2O2than sedentary rats (C and CCr).These data reinforce the observations of several authors that in-dicate that creatine appears to exert selective antioxidant effects [26,27].Lawler et al.[5] have shown that creatine was able to remove O 2-a n dO O N O-but had no effect on H2O2.
Thus, the direct antioxidant actions of creatine ap- pear to be limited to certain types of free radicals or react- ive oxygen species. Sestili et al.[4] have found thatcreatine was not able to significantly counteract the con- centrations of H 2O2and the compound tB-OOH that is derived from OH and RO radicals.With regard to levels of TBARS, our results are con- sistent with previous findings [35] that showed no change in hepatic TBARS levels in treadmill exercise-trained rats.Taken in aggregate, these results for pro- oxidant markers underscore the findings of Sjodin et al.[36] and Souza et al.[37], that is, predominantly aerobicexercise causes increased oxygen flow in the mitochon- dria and approximately five percent of this oxygen is not completely reduced, thereby forming ROS.As H 2O2levels rise, homeostasis requires increased production of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, GSH- GPx and CAT to maintain the balance between oxidantproduction and the antioxidant system [8,38,39].
Our study results for SOD demonstrate decreased enzymatic activity in trained animals (T and TCR) when they werecompared to group C rats. SOD is important in the me- tabolism of O2 - that results in the formation of H 2O2 [34,40,41].Thus, while SOD is an important combatant against oxidative stress, it also accelerates the formation of hydrogen peroxide, as occurs during physical exercise.In this situation, it has been suggested that reducedSOD activity is mainly explained by the inhibitory effect of increased H 2O2production [42].In this study, a hypothesis may explain the decrease in SOD activity in response to CrS.Creatine may exert a sparing effect, i.e., creatine may act to neutralize ROS, resulting in down-regulation of the antioxidant systemand specifically, the action of SOD.This hypothesis is based on research of antioxidant supplementation use that demonstrated inhibition of SOD, GSH-GPx and CAT activity [43,44].
However, a notable finding from these studies was that unlike SOD, the activity of GSH-GPx and CAT were increased in trained animals and CrS. Both GSH-GPx and CAT enzymes are present in most aerobic organisms and are responsible for conver-sion of intracellular H 2O2to water and oxygen [34,40].Our study demonstrated increase in GSH-GPx levels in exercised-trained rat groups T and TCr compared to con-trol group animals.This finding may be explained by the fact that regular physical training activates transcription factors such as NF- κB and Nrf2, which are responsible for triggering various genes, including mitochondrial GSH-GPx [45,46].Moreover, the effect of training on the activ- ity and expression of CAT is inconsistent and controver- sial [47].However, increased activity of this enzyme hasbeen observed in rat liver [48], mice liver [49] and trained rat heart [50].The most striking finding we encountered was the in- creased CAT activity that occurred only in animals given CrS.
This result appears to support an additive role for creatine on the actions of antioxidant enzymes. Physicaltraining, as demonstrated by Halliwell and Gutteridge [51], activates transcription factors such as AMPK, which activate CAT mRNA, thereby stimulating protein synthe-sis and possibly increasing CAT activity.The ability of CrS to also exert this effect remains controversial.According to Sestile et al.[4], creatine has neutralizing effects onROS production that do not interfere on the action of antioxidant enzymes.However, the increase in CAT activ- ity observed in this study is attributed to the formation ofH 2O2by SOD.According to Halliwel and Gutteridge [51], the chemical interaction of H 2O2at the catalase active site involves the transfer of a hydrogen ion between the twooxygen atoms, causing a heterolytic cleavage with water and oxygen end products.
The findings in our study of in- creased H 2O2levels in trained and supplemented animals combined with the neutralizing action of creatine on this ROS may explain the reduced oxidative damage seen with increased CAT activity. In contrast, the amounts of GSH and GSSG as well as the ratio between GSH/GSSG did not differ between the study groups.GSH has a central role in the biotrans-formation and elimination of xenobiotics, and protects cells against oxidative stress [52].To maintain the pro- tective activity of glutathione as expressed by the reduc-tion of oxidizing species and consequent oxidation of GSH to GSSG, GSH must be regenerated through the catalytic cycle [52].
In summary, our study results demonstrate that creat- ine supplementation acts in an additive manner to phys- ical training to increase antioxidant enzymes in rat liver.More studies are needed to expand our knowledge of the antioxidant effects of creatine and to investigate cre- atine ’s little-known effects on other body tissues.
