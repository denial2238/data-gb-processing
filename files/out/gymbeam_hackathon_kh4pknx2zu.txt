Nutrient Physiology, Metabolism, and Nutrient-Nutrient Interactions Dietary Vitamin A Affects the Function of Incretin-Producing Enteroendocrine Cells in Male Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet Rossana M.Calderon1,*, Marcin Golczak2,3, Jisun Paik4, William S.Blaner1 1Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States;2Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States;3Cleveland Center for Membrane and Structural Biology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States;4Department of Comparative Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States ABSTRACT Background: Retinol-binding protein 2 (RBP2) is an intracellular carrier for vitamin A in the absorptive enterocytes.Mice lacking RBP2 (Rbp2/C0//C0) display an unexpected phenotype of obesity, glucose intolerance, and elevated glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) levels.
GIP and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) are incretin hormones secreted by enteroendocrine cells (EECs). We recently demonstrated the presence of RBP2 and other retinoid-related proteins in EECs.Objectives: Given RBP2 ’s role in intracellular retinoid traf ﬁcking, we aimed to evaluate whether dietary vitamin A affects incretin-secreting cell function and gene expression.Methods: Male Rbp2 /C0//C0mice and sex- and age-matched controls ( n¼6–9) were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 18 wk containing normal (VAN, 4000 IU/kg of diet) or low (VAL, 25% of normal) vitamin A concentrations.Body weight was recorded biweekly.Plasma GIP and GLP-1 levels were obtained fasting and 30 min after an oral fat gavage at week 16.Glucose tolerance tests were also performed.Mice werekilled at week 18, and blood and tissue samples were obtained.Results: Rbp2 /C0//C0mice displayed greater weight gain on the VAN compared with the VAL diet from week 7 of the intervention ( P/C200.01).
Stimulated GIP levels were elevated in Rbp2/C0//C0mice compared with their controls fed the VAN diet ( P¼0.02), whereas their GIP response was lower when fed the VAL diet ( P¼0.03). Although no differences in GLP-1 levels were observed in the VAN diet group, a lower GLP-1 response was seen in Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed the VAL diet ( P¼0.02).Changes in incretin gene expression and that of other genes associated with EEC lineage and function were consistent with these observations.Circulating and hepatic retinoid levels revealed no systemic vitamin A deﬁciency across dietary groups.Conclusions: Our data support a role for RBP2 and dietary vitamin A in incretin secretion and gene expression in mice fed a HFD.
Keywords : retinol-binding protein 2, retinoids, enteroendocrine cells, incretins, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 Introduction Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are a relatively rare, specialized cell lineage within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that constitute<1% of all intestinal epithelial cells. They play a key role in regulating metabolism, with stimulation of insulin secretion, appetite regulation, and the regulation of secretion of other hormones among their many actions [ 1,2].EECs exert theirregulatory actions through the synthesis and secretion of peptide hormones and are classi ﬁed based on their main hormone product.However, this classi ﬁcation scheme has been increas- ingly challenged because it is now known that EEC sub- populations also express additional hormones other than thecanonical one upon which their identities are based [ 3].
For example, L cells express high mRNA levels for Gip, cholecysto- kinin ( Cck), secretin ( Sct), and neurotensin ( Nts), in addition to Abbreviations: ATRA, all-trans-retinoic acid; CCK, cholecystokinin; Chg, chromogranin; EEC, enteroendocrine cell; GCG, glucagon; GI, gastrointestinal; GIP, g lucose- dependent insulinotropic polypeptide; GIPR, GIP receptor; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide 1; GLP1R, GLP-1 receptor; HFD, high-fat diet; ip, intrape ritoneal; MAG, monoacylglycerol; Neurog3, neurogenin 3; NTS, neurotensin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PYY, polypeptide YY; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RB P, retinol-binding protein; RE, retinyl ester; ROL, retinol; SCG, secretogranin; Sct, secretin; SST, somatostatin; VAN, vitamin A normal; VAL, vitamin A low; WT, wild- type. * Corresponding author.E-mail address: rmc2204@cumc.columbia.edu (R.M.

A number of intestinal factors have beenreported to modulate EEC gene expression pro ﬁles and their cellular phenotypes, a phenomenon known as “plasticity ”[1,6, 7]. These factors include the region-speci ﬁc transcription factors Gata4, Gata6, Pdx1, and Cdx2 [ 8–10].These regional tran- scription factors are regulators of spatiotemporal patterningduring gut development and maturation, which results inspecialization along the intestinal cephalocaudal axis with different absorptive and digestive functions in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum [ 10,11].There are also a number of reports linking dietary factors with observed modi ﬁcations of EEC properties/actions, speci ﬁcally consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD), which was found to alter L cell gene and hormoneexpression [ 12–14].Vitamin A and its metabolites, collectively known as reti- noids, regulate cell development, differentiation, and prolifera-tion [ 15–17].
These important actions are mediated by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a transcriptionally activevitamin A metabolite [ 17,18]. Canonically, ATRA binds 3 nu- clear retinoic acid receptors (RAR- α,-βor -γ).The ATRA-RAR complex interacts with retinoic acid response elements withingenes, regulating transcription rates of over 500ATRA-responsive genes [ 15,16,19].However, retinol (ROL) and ATRA are also able to exert transcription-modulating actionsthrough noncanonical pathways [ 20].Among the many critical roles of retinoids within the body are the maintenance of barrierfunction, immunity, normal tissue growth and development, andreproduction, as well as other essential physiologic processes[17,21,22].As the main site of dietary absorption is the proximal small intestine, especially the jejunum [ 23], most investigations exploring intestinal retinoid metabolism have been directed to- ward the absorptive cell lineage, speci ﬁcally the enterocytes.
Due to the lipophilic nature of retinoids, retinol-binding protein2 (RBP2), which in the adult is solely present in the intestine, hasa pivotal role as the intracellular carrier of ROL and reti-naldehyde, facilitating retinoid absorption, intracellular traf-ﬁcking, and metabolism [ 24–26]. RBP2 acts within enterocytes channeling dietary retinoid to either the formation of retinylesters (REs), which are packaged into nascent chylomicrons, ortoward the formation of ATRA.We have previously reported thatmice lacking RBP2 ( Rbp2 /C0//C0) show greater weight gain and abnormal glucose tolerance than wild-type (WT) controls at 6 –8 mo of age when maintained on a unpuri ﬁed diet or at 3 –4m oo f age after 2 mo of HFD feeding [ 27].The mutant mice also show elevated fasting and fat stimulated plasma levels of GIP [ 27].
We have established that RBP2 is also able to bind 2-monoacylgly-cerols (2-MAGs) with high af ﬁnity [ 28], whose concentrations are directly dependent on the digestion of dietary fats [ 29]. 2-MAGs are potent stimulants for the nutrient chemosensorGPR-119, which is found in the surfaces of incretin-producingcells and controls GIP and GLP-1 secretion from the cells [ 30,31].Because Rbp2 /C0//C0mice also display elevated 2-MAG levels in the intestinal mucosa compared with WT mice [ 27], this is a potential paracrine mechanism for the elevated GIP levels weobserved in this mouse model [ 32,33].We have reported that RBP2 and other genes and protein products that are involved in mediating retinoid metabolism, including the enzyme responsible for retinoic acid formation, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, RAR- α, and interestingly, the sole speciﬁc extracellular ROL carrier, retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), are all present in EECs [ 34].
These observations led us to hypothesize that RBP2 plays a direct role in the regulation of EECbiology, especially that involving GIP. One likely mechanism forthis is through its role in intracellular retinoid traf ﬁcking and metabolism.Considering that Rbp2 /C0//C0mice develop metabolic phenotypes faster when fed a HFD, we conducted functional andgene analysis studies exploring whether GIP and GLP-1 areinﬂuenced by feeding of either control levels (as per the AIN-93M diet formulation [ 35]) or low (25% of the AIN-93M recommendation) of vitamin A on a background of HFDfeeding (60% of calories from fat).This allowed us to speci ﬁcally assess the effects of dietary vitamin A intake on incretin secretionand related metabolic parameters under conditions of high di-etary fat intake.
Given the role of RBP2 in retinoid metabolism,our present studies evaluated the hypothesis that dietary reti-noids affect incretin expression and plasma levels, which mayhelp explain the metabolic phenotypes seen in Rbp2 /C0//C0mice. Methods Animals, animal husbandry, and dietary study design We studied age- and sex- matched male Rbp2/C0//C0and WT mice congenic in the C57BL/6 genetic background.The Rbp2/C0//C0mice were originally described by Li and colleagues [ 26].Because the adverse effects of HFD feeding in Rbp2/C0//C0mice develop more rapidly in male mice than in females, only male mice were used in the present investigation.Mice were maintained on a 12:12-h dark-light cycle and provided with access to food and water adlibitum in a conventional barrier facility.
All animal experimentswere conducted in accordance with the National ResearchCouncil ’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [ 36] and were approved by the Columbia University InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee. At 3 mo of age, Rbp2 /C0//C0and WT animals ( n¼6–9) were allocated to a HFD containing either a normal vitamin A content,deﬁned as 4000 IU/kg diet as recommended by the AIN-93M formulation [ 35] (we will refer to this dietary group as vitamin A normal or VAN diet) or a low dietary vitamin A, de ﬁned as 1000 IU/kg diet, 25% of the AIN-93M recommended dose (wewill refer to this dietary group as vitamin A low or VAL diet).Both diets (VAN and VAL) were obtained from Research Diets(D12492 and D19122001, respectively) and otherwise had anidentical formulation with 60% of calories from fat (mainly lard[91% of total-fat content]), 20% of calories from protein, and20% of calories from carbohydrates.
The mineral and vitamincontents of these diets (with the exception of the vitamin Aamount for the VAL diet group) were those of the AIN-93Mmature rodent diet formulation [ 35]. Prior to the start of the HFD feeding, animals were weaned at 21 d of age and kept on aR.M.Calderon et al.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 2901 –2914 2902 chow diet (PicoLab Rodent Diet 20).This unpuri ﬁed diet used at our animal facility contains 15,000 vitamin A IU/kg diet (over 3times the AIN-93M recommended dose) and provides 24.6%calories from protein, 13.2% calories from fat, and 62.1% calo-ries from carbohydrates.Due to the hepatic storage of vitamin Aduring the period from weaning to the start of the dietary intervention, a lengthy dietary intervention time was planned (18 wk) [ 37].After being assigned to a HFD group, Rbp2 /C0//C0and WT mice were weighed twice a week during the 18-wk durationof the study.
Changes in body weight (g) from the baselineweight at the beginning of the study were calculated thereafter. Biochemical analysis For hormone measurements, blood samples were obtained at week 16 of the dietary intervention from the tails of Rbp2/C0//C0and WT mice.After an overnight fast, samples were obtained at baseline (0 min) and 30 min after the administration of an oralgavage with corn oil (10 μL/g weight) [ 38].Plasma was obtained after centrifugation of the blood sample at 3000 /C2gand 4/C14C for 15 min.Levels of GIP, GLP-1 and insulin were assessed in plasmaby ELISA using commercially available ELISA kits following themanufacturer ’s instructions: GLP-1 (Crystal Chem, 81508), GIP (Crystal Chem, 81527), and insulin (Crystal Chem, 90080).Glucose tolerance test For glucose tolerance tests, at week 17 of the feeding regimen, mice were weighed, and baseline blood glucose was measuredfrom tail blood using an Accu Chek Aviva plus handheld gluc-ometer (Roche).
An intraperitoneal (ip) injection of a 20%glucose solution at 2 g/kg body weight was administered, andblood glucose measurements were taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90,and 120 min after glucose injection. AUC values were obtainedusing the modi ﬁed trapezoidal rule, where baseline values were subtracted (incremental AUC, mg/dL/120min) [ 39,40].Data for each time point were compared between strains (WT compared with Rbp2 /C0//C0) and between dietary groups within the same strain (4000 IU compared with 1000 IU/kg diet) using a 2-wayanalysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the genotype –dietary vitamin A interaction followed by multiple comparison analysisusing the Sidak test.RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR At the end of the dietary intervention, animals were killed according to Columbia University guidelines, and jejunal mucosa (second 10 cm of the proximal small intestine) was obtained.
This section of the intestine was selected because it is the placewere absorption of fat soluble vitamins, especially vitamin A, isthe highest [ 23]. The lumen was rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and opened longitudinally.Mucosa scrapings were obtained and ﬂash-frozen in liquid ni- trogen.From the frozen tissue, total RNA was extracted usingTRIzol (Ambion) and isolated using the E.Z.N.A.Total RNA kit II(Omega Bio-tek) as per the manufacturer ’s instructions.All samples were reverse transcribed following standard protocols toobtain cDNA using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems,Cat No.4368814).Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using PerfeCTa SYBR Green FastMix (QuantaBiosciences, 95072-250) in a LightCycler 480 instrument(LightCycler 480 software v ersion1.5.0.39, Roche).Expressionwas compared with that of the18S value for each samplemeasured in parallel on the same plate.
Calculations were per- formed using a CT difference ( ΔCT) for 18S minus the gene being tested. Mean, SD, and statistics were performed on the ΔCT data and converted to relative expression levels (2 ΔCT) for graphics generation.Primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 1 .ROL and RE quanti ﬁcation Plasma and liver tissue homogenates were extracted under dim yellow light to assess ROL and RE levels by HPLC using our standard method [ 41,42].Brie ﬂy, the excised liver was homog- enized in PBS.Plasma (100 μL) or liver homogenate was mixed with an equal volume of ethanol containing internal standard(retinyl acetate; Sigma Aldrich) [ 43].Neutral retinoids present in the denatured tissue samples were then extracted into hexane.After the collected hexane was evaporated under nitrogen, theretinoid-containing ﬁlms were dissolved in benzene and sepa- rated on a Symmetry C18 column (Waters).
Quanti ﬁcation of extracted retinoids was performed by measuring the AUC ofabsorbance peaks at 325 nm and adjusted based on the recoveryof the internal standard. Plasma ROL is expressed as μmol/L, whereas hepatic RE levels (as the sum of all RE species) and ROL are expressed as nmol/g of liver.Statistics All data are presented as means /C6SEM.Data were analyzed for statistical signi ﬁcance using standard procedures consisting of a 2-way ANOVA.This was followed by Sidak ’s post hoc multiple comparison test among different groups.All data ob-tained from measures were included in statistical calculations.Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9(version 9.4.1), and signi ﬁcant differences were noted for P< 0.05.
Results Dietary vitamin A in ﬂuences body weight gain and glucose tolerance in Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed a HFD To understand the effects of dietary vitamin A in Rbp2/C0//C0 mice and their WT controls, a HFD providing 60% of calories from fat containing either normal or low dietary vitamin A (VANor VAL, respectively) was administered to the mice as describedabove. At the start of the study, animals were matched for age and were similar in weight and fasting glucose levels ( Supple- mental Table 2 ).No statistical differences in these baseline pa- rameters were observed between the groups.During the dietaryintervention period, WT animals in the VAN dietary group didnot show a signi ﬁcant difference in weight gain compared with WT animals fed the VAL diet ( Figure 1 A).However, Rbp2 /C0//C0 mice fed the VAN diet had signi ﬁcantly greater weight change from week 6 onward when compared with Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed the VAL diet ( Figure 1 A).
This difference became progressively greater through the end of the 18-wk feeding protocol ( P<0.005 from week 14 through the end of the study). Fasting glucose levels (0 ’) were not different for the WT and Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed the VAN diet (143.8 /C634.9 and 156.2 /C635 mg/dL, respectively) or when fed the VAL diet (WT 131.2 /C616.7 compared with Rbp2/C0//C0135.6 /C617.3 mg/dL).We did not detect signiﬁcant differences in fasting glucose levels between dietaryR.M.Calderon et al.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 2901 –2914 2903 groups for the same strain of mice ( Figure 1 B).No signi ﬁcant differences were seen between Rbp2/C0//C0and their WT controls maintained on either the VAN or the VAL diet.
Although no signiﬁcant difference in glucose levels was observed between the WT dietary groups at any timepoint after an ip glucose challenge,Rbp2 /C0//C0mice fed the VAN diet showed signi ﬁcantly greater glucose concentrations at 90 min compared with the Rbp2/C0//C0 mice on the VAL diet ( Figure 1 B).Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed the VAN diet showed the greatest AUC, which was signi ﬁcantly different from their WT controls fed the same diet ( Figure 1 C), as well as from Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed the VAL diet. Dietary vitamin A in ﬂuences the stimulated incretin and insulin plasma levels in Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed the HFD After 16 wk of feeding the HFDs containing either normal or low vitamin A concentrations, Rbp2/C0//C0mice and their WT con- trols were given an oral fat challenge with corn oil to assess whether the different vitamin A dietary concentrations affected incretin-stimulated plasma levels.
Note that we earlier demon-strated elevated GIP levels for Rbp2 /C0//C0mice compared with littermate WT mice fed a HFD containing normal vitamin Aconcentrations [ 27]. Fasting ( P¼0.03) ( Figure 2 A) andstimulated circulating GIP levels ( P¼0.02) ( Figure 2 B) were signiﬁcantly elevated in Rbp2 /C0//C0mice when compared with their WT counterparts fed the VAN diet.In the VAL diet group, no differences in fasting GIP levels were observed between strains ( Figure 2 A).However, Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed the VAL diet showed lower stimulated GIP levels —~50% less —than the WT mice from the same dietary group ( P¼0.02) ( Figure 2 B).Upon comparison of the 2 dietary interventions (VAN compared withVAL) by mouse strain, GIP levels were not different for WT micemaintained on the different diets ( Figure 2 A, B) ( P¼0.07).Rbp2 /C0//C0mice on the VAN diet had more robust stimulated GIP levels than Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed the VAL diet ( P¼0.01) ( Figure 2 B).
With regards to GLP-1, no difference in basal ( Figure 2 C) and stimulated levels ( Figure 2 D) were observed between Rbp2/C0//C0 mice and their WT counterparts maintained on the VAN diet [27]. However, a signi ﬁcantly lower GLP-1-stimulated response to an oral fat challenge was observed in Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed the VAL diet compared with WT animals fed the same diet ( P¼0.02) (Figure 2 D).No differences in GLP-1 were observed for com- parisons between dietary groups on either strain ( Figure 2 C, D).In terms of plasma insulin levels, although no signi ﬁcant differ- ences were observed in fasting insulin levels between strainswhen fed the VAN diet ( Figure 2 E),Rbp2 /C0//C0mice showed an approximately 2-fold elevation on their stimulated insulin levels FIGURE 1.Effects of feeding a HFD with different vitamin A concentrations on weight gain and glucose tolerance in WT and Rbp2/C0//C0mice.
Male WT and Rbp2/C0//C0mice on a control (VAN, 4000 IU/kg diet) or a low dietary vitamin A (VAL, 1000 IU/kg weight) were followed over 18 wk assessing body weight change (g from baseline) (A).

Hormone and intestinal region-speci ﬁc transcription factor mRNA expressions are affected by differences on dietary vitamin A in mice fed the HFD In addition to GIP and GLP-1, other hormones are expressed in K and L EECs [ 3]. Consequently, besides incretin gene expression levels, we also assessed gene expression levels for Sct, Pyy, Cck , and Nts[3,44].Although somatostatin (SST) is not among the hormones reported to be coexpressed in K and L cells, we studiedits expression because K and L cells express SST receptors, and Dcells (the EEC subtype that produces SST) reportedly expressreceptors for GIP (GIPR) and GLP-1 (GLP1R) [ 45–47].We observed that Rbp2 /C0//C0mice present higher relative expression of Gipas well as Sct, Nts, and Sstin jejunal mucosa than their WT controls fed the VAN diet ( Figure 3 A, C, F, G).In contrast, Rbp2/C0//C0mice on the VAL diet presented signi ﬁcantly lower Gip, Gcg, Pyy, Cck, and Nts expression than their WT counterparts (Figure 3 A, B, F).
However, Sctwas more highly expressed in the null mice than their WT controls ( Figure 3 C). Upon assessment of the effects of dietary vitamin A concentrations per strain, weobserved that WT mice have greater Gip, Gcg, Pyy, Nts, and Sst expression when fed the VAL diet compared with the VAN dietgroup.However, no differences in the expression of these genes were observed in Rbp2 /C0//C0mice fed the VAN compared with the VAL diet.Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest a role for dietary vitamin A in modulating gut hormone gene expression.Throughout the length of the small intestine, differences in gene and protein expression pro ﬁles and cell type distribution FIGURE 2.Differences in baseline and stimulated incretin and insulin hormone levels in WT and Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed HFDs containing different vitamin A concentrations.
Incretins (GIP, A and B; GLP-1, C and D) and insulin (E and F) were measured in Rbp2/C0//C0and matched WT controls after 16 wk of feeding the HFD containing different vitamin A concentrations. Levels were obtained fasting (0 ’) (A, C, E) and at 30 min (30 ’) (B, D, F) after an oral fat challenge with corn oil.Comparisons of the 4 dietary groups were made for each hormone.Clear bars represent WT mice and darkgray bars represent Rbp2 /C0//C0mice.Data are presented as means /C6SEM.Main signi ﬁcant differences and their Pvalues are displayed.Additional comparisons are represented by symbols:#P<0.05–0.01,##P<0.01 comparing WT on the VAN diet with Rbp2/C0//C0mice on VAL diet.R.M.Calderon et al.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 2901 –2914 2905 exist [ 48] that correlate to the functions attributed to each in- testinal region (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) [ 49].
A number of transcription factors, including Pdx1, Gata4, Gata6, Gata5,Cdx2, Hnf1a, and Hnf1b, have been identi ﬁed as regulators of the abovementioned intestinal spatial/regional differences.These region-speci ﬁc transcription factors follow a gradient distribution along the small intestine proximal-distal axis, where Gata4, Gata6 and Pdx1 are enriched proximally [ 10] in a similar manner to RBP2 [ 24,25]. Of note, Gata4, Gata6, and Pdx1 have an established relationship with retinoids in the development ofmultiple organs, including the heart, pancreas, and urothelialtissue [ 50–53].Due to their previously established relationship with retinoids and the attributed effects that these regionalfactors have on EEC hormone expression and plasticity, we explored how different dietary vitamin A concentrations mightaffect their expression levels [ 8,9,54].
For the VAN diet group, we found greater expression of the regional transcription factorsGata6 and Cdx2 and the stem cell marker Lgr5 in jejuna from Rbp2 /C0//C0mice compared with WT controls ( Figure 3 H, J, L), in a similar manner to the hormone gene expression described above. Gata4 expression was not different in Rbp2/C0//C0compared with WT mice ( P¼0.08).In contrast, we observed that Rbp2/C0//C0mice on the VAL diet presented signi ﬁcantly lower expressions of Gata4 ,Gata6 , and Lgr5 compared with WT controls receiving this same diet ( Figure 3 H, I, L).However, upon comparison of rela- tive expression between dietary groups for the same strain, we FIGURE 3.Relative expression of hormones related to K and L cells and regional transcription factors in the jejuna of Rbp2/C0//C0and WT controls fed HFDs containing different concentrations of vitamin A.
Jejunal mucosa were obtained from Rbp2/C0//C0and littermate WT mice for assessment of relative mRNA expression of incretin hormones (A –B), hormones coexpressed in or related to K and L cells (C –G) as well as regional transcription factors (TFs) (H –K), and the stem cell marker Lgr5 (L) as well as quanti ﬁed by RT-PCR. Comparisons were made in the 4 dietary groups (WT and Rbp2/C0//C0mice on either normal [VAN] or low [VAL] dietary vitamin A concentrations) for each set of genes.Clear bars represent WT mice and dark gray bars represent Rbp2/C0//C0mice.Data are presented as means /C6SEM.Main signi ﬁcant differences and their Pvalues are displayed.Additional comparisons are represented by symbols: ^P<0.05 –0.01, ^^P<0.01 comparing WT on the VAL diet with Rbp2/C0//C0mice on VAN diet.#P<0.05 –0.01,##P<0.01 comparing WT on the VAN diet with Rbp2/C0//C0mice on VAL diet.R.M.Calderon et al.
The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 2901 –2914 2906 found that WT controls fed the VAL diet presented higher Gata6, Gata4, Pdx1, Cdx2, and Lgr5 relative expression compared with the VAN diet group ( Figure 3 H, I, J, K, L). Interestingly, relative expression of these genes was not different between Rbp2/C0//C0 mice fed these diets.This suggests that Rbp2 expression status appears to affect the expression of these genes.Effects of dietary vitamin A on EEC gene expression of genes involved in hormone storage, traf ﬁcking, and secretion in mice fed a HFD Given the vitamin A-dependent differences in hormone gene expression reported above, we assessed the effects of differentdietary vitamin A concentrations on other genes speci ﬁc to EECs.We analyzed the relative expression of genes involved in hor-mone processing and traf ﬁcking, including granins (proteins responsible for secretory granules packing and traf ﬁcking) and proteases involved in prohormone processing.
We observed thatgene expression levels of chromogranin b ( Chgb ), secretogranin 3 (Scg3) and the enzyme carboxypeptidase E were higher in jejunal mucosa from Rbp2 /C0//C0mice compared with their WT controls when fed the VAN diet ( Figure 4 B, D, G). However, no differ- ences in expression of these genes were observed betweenRbp2 /C0//C0mice and their WT controls in the VAL diet group,except for higher Chgb expression observed in Rbp2/C0//C0mice (Figure 4 B).When evaluating the effects of the 2 different diets by strain, WT mice showed higher expression levels of chro-mogranin A ( Chga ), secretogranin 2 ( Scg2),Scg3, secretogranin 5 (Scg5) and the enzyme proprotein convertase subtisilin/kexin type 1 when fed the VAL diet compared with the VAN diet (Figure 4 A, C, D, E, F).With regard to the Rbp2 /C0//C0mice, they only displayed higher Scg3 expression when fed the VAL diet than those maintained on the VAN diet ( Figure 4 D).
We evaluated in jejunal mucosa expression of transcription factors known to be involved in the determination of EEC line- age. We found signi ﬁcantly higher expression of Isl1,Nkx2-2, Pax6, and Rfx6 inRbp2/C0//C0mice maintained on the VAN diet than in their WT counterparts ( Figure 5 D, H, J, L).This is consistent with their higher incretin hormone expression andlevels, especially for GIP, whose expression is known to beupregulated by Rfx6 and Isl1[8,55].When fed the VAL diet, Rbp2 /C0//C0mice show lower neurogenin 3 ( Neurog3 ) and Pax4 expression compared with WT controls ( Figure 5 G, I).Neurog3 is a pro-endocrine transcription factor that is present in endocrineprogenitor cells.Upon comparison of the 2 dietary groups (VANcompared with VAL) by strain, Arx, Insm1, Neurog3, andNkx2-2 were highly expressed in the VAL compared with VAN group in FIGURE 4.

WT controls additionally presented higher expression of NeuroD1, Pax4, Pax6, andProx1 in the VAL compared with the VAN group (Figure 5 F, I, J, K).Rbp2/C0//C0mice showed higher Etv1 expression in the VAL compared with the VAN group ( Figure 5 B).Circulating ROL levels do not account for the incretin hormone response to dietary vitamin A To assess the status of systemic retinoid homeostasis in the animals subjected to different dietary vitamin A intake [ 56], we evaluated plasma ROL levels and hepatic retinoid storage.Thisprovided understanding of whether circulating ROL levels wereimpaired and whether this may be correlated with the differ-ences in hormone gene expression and levels observed betweenRbp2 /C0//C0mice and their WT controls.
This is especially relevant, as RBP2 acts as the intracellular carrier for ROL and reti- naldehyde, facilitating their absorption by enterocytes [ 25]. In addition, RBP2 is present in EECs [ 34].We found that plasma ROL levels were not different between the groups and remainedwithin the normal range in all animals ( P¼0.74) ( Figure 6 A).However, we observed RE levels in the liver (the main tissue sitefor retinoid storage) in the VAN diet group Rbp2 /C0//C0mice pre- sented lower levels than their WT counterparts, as previouslyreported [ 26](Figure 6 B).No differences in hepatic REs were observed in the VAL dietary group nor were differences in he-patic ROL levels observed ( P¼0.28, Figure 6 C).Of note, although hepatic RE levels were signi ﬁcantly higher in WT mice fed the VAN diet than in any other group ( Figure 6 B), the observed hepatic RE levels across the groups indicate that none FIGURE 5.

This is due to the ability of mice to store retinoids in their livers duringperiods of dietary suf ﬁciency, stores that can last for several months [ 37]. As we observed effects or different dietary vitamin A concentrations despite the absence of differences on systemic vitamin A status, we take these data to indicate that the changes observed in hormone levels and gene expression arise due tolocal effects in the intestine rather than systemic ones.A sum- mary of our ﬁndings is provided in Figure 7 .Discussion We have previously reported the presence of RBP2 and a number of other retinoid-related proteins in EECs [ 34].Due to FIGURE 6.Effects of dietary vitamin A on circulating ROL and liver retinoid levels in Rbp2/C0//C0and WT mice fed the HFD.Plasma ROL (A) as well as hepatic REs (B) and hepatic ROL levels (C) were assessed by HPLC after tissue collection.Clear bars represent WT mice and dark gray barsrepresent Rbp2 /C0//C0mice.Data are presented as means /C6SEM.

The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 2901 –2914 2909 RBP2 ’s role as an intracellular modulator for retinoid meta- bolism and given our previous observations of elevated circu-lating GIP levels in response of an oral fat challenge when RBP2is absent, our study aimed to extend understanding the role ofdietary vitamin A on gene expression and hormone response inincretin-secreting cells in mice fed a HFD to induce obesity. A signiﬁcant difference in weight gain in Rbp2 /C0//C0mice was observed when comparing the different vitamin A diet groups,such that Rbp2 /C0//C0mice fed the VAN diet exhibited greater weight gain than when fed the VAL diet.Our group previouslyreported that Rbp2 /C0//C0mice fed a unpuri ﬁed diet exhibit greater weight gain than WT controls as they age (6 –8 mo of age) or after 8 wk of being fed a HFD with a normal vitamin A content (4000IU/kg of diet) [ 27].
These differences in body weight were due in both cases to a greater increase in body fat percentage comparedwith WT controls [ 27]. However, the ﬁnding that Rbp2 /C0//C0mice on a HFD gain less weight when dietary vitamin A concentrations are low suggests a role for dietary vitamin A in modulating adiposity in this mouse strain.Although vitamin A and relatedproteins have a known direct role on adipose tissue homeostasis,based on mechanisms reviewed and reported elsewhere [ 18, 57–62], RBP2 is not expressed in adipose tissue.Therefore, RBP2 actions to increase adiposity are likely indirect ones.In this context, GIP, like GLP-1, is a versatile hormone that inﬂuences not only insulin release from pancreatic βcells after nutrient stimulation —the“incretin effect ”[63–67]—but also acts in other organs that possess GIPRs, including the hypothal-amus, bone, and adipose tissue [ 68–72].
At the same time, an impaired incretin effect (especially GIP) is part of the physio- pathology of type 2 diabetes. In adipose tissue, GIP ’s reported actions include enhanced lipoprotein lipase activity, an increasein triglyceride deposition and increased blood ﬂow, all of which contribute to adipose tissue expansion [ 73,74].These actions along with a more robust GIP response to an oral fat stimulusthan to other macronutrients [ 75,76] are why this incretin has been paradoxically dubbed as an “obesity hormone, ”prompting the development of GIPR antagonists for adipose tissue as atherapeutic solution for obesity [ 77].Postprandial GIP levels have been reported to be more relevant to the association of elevated GIP levels with obesity [ 71].
Our observations of an increase in weight gain in the Rbp2 /C0//C0mouse model fed the VAN diet, whose stimulated GIP levels were the highest, is consistentwith these previous reports, although the exact mechanismsresponsible for this are currently unknown. The opposite effect inbody weight was seen in Rbp2 /C0//C0mice on the VAL diet, where the stimulated GIP (and GLP-1) response was lower ( Figure 2 ).Accordingly, mRNA expression levels for Gipwere higher in Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed a VAN diet than their WT controls whereas lower GipandGcgexpression was observed in Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed the VAL diet compared with their WT controls.We also observed a quantitatively larger signi ﬁcant impairment in glucose toler- ance and higher stimulated insulin levels in the Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed the VAN diet, consistent with their increased body weight incomparison with the other groups.
Thus, GIP levels seem to be alikely explanation for the differences in weight in Rbp2 /C0//C0mice maintained in the 2 different vitamin A containing diets, butmore research will be needed to verify this. The dichotomy presented here, where elevated GIP levels in our Rbp2 /C0//C0mouse model fed a HFD with normal dietary vitamin A levels is associated with greater weight gain, andglucose intolerance is not different with the long-observed paradox seen in animal and human studies of GIP in diabetes.It has been proposed that the chronic elevation in GIP levels ininsulin resistant states may result in downregulation of the GIPRinβcells or simply in unresponsiveness, which is regained when glycemic control is achieved [ 78,79].However, an FDA-approved dual GIP and GLP-1 agonist has yielded favorable synergistic effects on glucose and weight control in humans [ 80, 81].
Some researchers postulate that the restoration of the incretin effect by this pharmacologic agent is achieved by theactivation of a different signaling pathway upon stimulation ofthe GIPR concomitant with the GLP1R compared with earliertherapeutic agents [ 82,83]. This is relevant as mouse studies with GIPR agonists have also shown body weight lowering ef-fects and decreased food intake, possibly mediated by the GIPRin the hypothalamus [ 70,84].All in all, further identi ﬁcation and study of factors affecting GIP expression and levels as well as GIP’s different mechanisms of action are necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the conditions that may lead to eitherits bene ﬁcial or its less desirable metabolic effects.EECs are affected by intricate signaling networks that govern not only the crypt-villus axis but also the proximodistal axis inthe intestine [ 6,7,10,85,86].
They are also differentially distributed along the small intestine, with K cells found to bemore abundant proximally whereas L cells are more enricheddistally. As region-speci ﬁc transcription factors affect EEC number and hormone expression [ 8,55,87], our observations that the expression patterns of some of these region-speci ﬁc transcription factors (e.g., Gata6, Gata4 ) as well as the stem cell marker Lgr5 change in a similar direction as Gipgene expression in the presence of normal or low dietary vitamin Aconcentrations is suggestive of a relationship between retinoidsand regional transcription factors in the intestine.This isparticularly relevant given the well-established association be-tween retinoids with transcription factors such as Gata4, Gata6,and Pdx1, including a recent report of a close link between Gata4and ROL metabolism in the intestine [ 88], and is consistent with our previous report of the presence of RBP2 and otherretinoid-related proteins in EECs [ 34].
In addition to changes in incretin expression, our data show that other hormones coexpressed by (or related to) K and L cellsare also affected by dietary differences in vitamin A content, asthe gene expression of some of them (e.g., Nts) changed in the same manner as that observed for incretin gene expression. Thisspeaks to the concept of plasticity, where a given EEC subpop-ulation coexpresses genes for other hormones besides their ca-nonical one(s) and are able to switch this expression in responseto local intestinal factors [ 1,89].Our data also show that changes in expression for some of the genes involved in EEC secretoryprocesses, hormone formation and cell-speci ﬁc transcription factors for incretin-producing EECs were mostly consistent with our observed changes in hormone levels ( Figure 7 ).
For example, Isl1and Rfx6 gene expression —which have a direct association with Gipexpression — are consistent with increased GIP expres- sion and circulating levels in Rbp2/C0//C0mice fed a VAN diet when compared with their WT controls. Interestingly, we previouslyfound a paradoxical lower K cell count in Rbp2 /C0//C0mice fed a unpuri ﬁed diet compared with their WT controls [ 34], which suggested that an augmented Gipexpression and not an increase in K cells may be responsible for the elevated GIP levels observedR.M.Calderon et al.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 2901 –2914 2910 inRbp2/C0//C0mice.It is important to remember that because our data regarding gene expression levels are for whole mucosa andnot from isolated K or L cells, our ﬁndings do not differentiate whether the observed changes in hormone mRNA expression aredue to changes on the number of those speci ﬁc EEC populations or alterations in hormone expression within the EEC lineage.
Another consideration is that we studied mucosa from the proximal jejunum, the site where vitamin A absorption is thehighest [ 23]. Because EEC distribution along the proximal-distal intestinal axis varies, data from the furthermost proximal anddistal regions from the small intestine would provide additionalimportant information.Further studies involving isolation ofspeciﬁc EEC lineages are needed to be able to con ﬁrm these hypotheses.Additionally, the observation of an upregulation inthe expression of genes that promote the EEC lineage such asNeurog3, Insm1, and Nkx2-2 on both strains when fed the VALdiet is an unexpected yet interesting ﬁnding, suggesting that dietary vitamin A may have an effect on the endocrine progen- itor cells [ 90,91].HFD feeding per se has been reported to alter K and L cell function by several investigators [ 12–14,92], although with inconclusive results given the great variability in study designacross different investigations [ 93].
However, a direct effect of HFD feeding rather than its consequential obesity seems to be themost likely explanation for these modi ﬁcations in EECs. Studies in either genetically obese mice or obese humans found no dif-ferences in EEC number or hormone gene expression upon comparison with lean controls [ 14,94,95].However, comorbid- ities, such as diabetes, have been reported to affect EECs in pa-tients with obesity [ 96].Our observations on functional hormone responses and gene expression changes on animals feda HFD with different vitamin A contents suggest that RBP2 anddietary vitamin A may have an important role on EEC function.However, we have yet to establish whether these changes inincretin levels and gene expression are because of an effect eitherdirectly on K and/or L cells or rather on the differentiation andnumber of EECs in general, favoring incretin expression andsecretion.
Also, given RBP2 ’s ability to bind MAGs (which result from the metabolism of dietary fats) and MAGs ’role as important stimuli for K and L cells, the interrelationship between MAGs andretinoid concentrations in the intestinal lumen is anotherimportant aspect to consider. Further studies to dissect how thebalance between these 2 factors may affect the local intestinalenvironment and their identi ﬁed signaling pathways, thereby affecting EECs, are needed.Additionally, whether the observedchanges in gene expression due to dietary vitamin A concentra-tion result from retinoid transcriptional effects through eithertheir classical or nonclassical pathway is still to be fully char-acterized.This is especially relevant in this case as fatty acid binding protein 5 is a major component of a nonclassical retinoid signaling pathway, and it is also highly expressed in K cells [ 20, 97,98].
In conclusion, our current study shows that dietary vitamin A concentrations are able to affect weight gain and incretin response in mice lacking RBP2 when fed a HFD. We observedchanges in hormone gene expression that are in accordance withobserved differences in stimulated incretin levels.The changeson GIP response are also congruent with the differences inweight gain observed under different dietary vitamin A intakes.However, given the intricate network of factors affecting EECs, acareful dissection on how changes in the factors analyzed in this study (e.g., region-speci ﬁc transcription factors, dietary reti- noids) relate to each other and ultimately affect incretin-secreting EEC function is needed.This is especially importantgiven the previously identi ﬁed paracrine (through 2-MAGs) and potential autocrine effects that RBP2 possess in this secretory cell lineage.
Therefore, RBP2 direct actions on incretin-producing EECs as well as its effects on other EEC populations and theirinterplay merit further investigation to characterize theirmechanistic relationship and potential impact on metabolicdisorders.
