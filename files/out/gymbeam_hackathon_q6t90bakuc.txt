Methods: Residents of five communities participated.Community advisory board members were recruited and provided feedback to local environmental change projects, recruitment, and community engagement at each site.At each site, four education sessions were provided by trained facilitators on cancer risk factors and etiology, racial disparities, eligibility for cancer screening, and par- ticipation in clinical trials.
Attendance, knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about cancer, and height, weight, and waist circumference were measured at baseline and 1- week post- CHANGE sessions. Results: 90 residents (60% 65 and older years old, 33% male, 60% High School ed- ucation, 93% AA) participated in the program.95% completed post- intervention evaluation.Participants were eligible for breast (n = 12), prostate (n = 15), and colorectal screening (n = 25) based on American Cancer Society guidelines, and 22 for tobacco cessation; 21 participants accepted navigation assistance for these services.At post- test, participants significantly increased in knowledge and be- haviors around obesity/overweight risk for cancer, nutrition, and physical activ- ity.Colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer knowledge scores also increased, but were not significant.Conclusions: CHANGE participants demonstrated improved health knowl- edge and intentions to improve their modifiable health behaviors.
Participants reported being motivated and confident in seeking preventive care and satisfac- tion with community engagement efforts. Replication of this project in similar communities may improve knowledge and health equity among underserved populations.2 of 10 | VERNON et al.1 | INTRODUCTION Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States following heart disease.1 In the United States, at least 42% of newly diagnosed cancers are potentially avoidable, including 19% caused by smoking and 18% that are caused by a combination of excess body weight, physical inactivity, excess alcohol consumption, and poor nutrition.1 African Americans and other ethnic and racial populations in the United States suffer disproportion- ately from cancer.1 While overall incidence and mortal- ity rates have decreased substantially for prostate, breast and colorectal cancers over the last few decades, African American men and women continue to suffer dispropor- tionately.
African Americans are less likely than whites to survive 5 years after being diagnosed with most forms of cancer, at any stage of diagnosis.1 African Americans also have the highest death rate and worse survival rate of any racial/ethnic group in the United States for most cancers. In addition, African American men and women are less likely to be screened, more likely to utilize lower- resourced and non- accredited facilities, and more likely to experience longer intervals between screening and fol- low- up for abnormal findings.2–4 To reduce cancer disparities among African Americans, we developed and tested a multicomponent intervention.
The Cancer Health Awareness through screening and Education (CHANGE) initiative was designed to improve cancer care and reduce racial disparities and inequities in a sustainable and collaborative community- based man- ner by: (1) increasing evidence- based cancer awareness though health literacy and education, with an emphasis on prevention of modifiable risk factors, screening, and early detection; and (2) providing access and navigation to high- quality cancer screening and early detection ser- vices. Pre- and post- intervention knowledge, attitudes and beliefs were measured, as well as changes in cancer health behaviors and rates of screening.2 | METHODS The study population consisted of African American Augusta Housing Authority residents who were 21 to 80 years of age, English speaking, and able to answer ques- tions on a computer or paper survey, either independently or with assistance.Up to 30 participants were recruited at each of five sites that delivered the intervention.
The Theory of Planned Behavior was used a guiding frame- work for the project, with knowledge, beliefs (worry about cancer), and intentions (plans) assessed. 2.1 | Recruitment In collaboration with Community Advisory Boards (CABs) of representatives from each participating community, re- cruitment flyers were posted in community rooms and in community mailboxes.Staff attended community resident events including farmer's markets, back to school fairs, and holiday events to promote the study.Participants were also referred by the Director of the Augusta Housing Authority.2.2 | Community Advisory Board A CAB was convened with 10 members representing the 5 respective Augusta Housing Authority sites.Members were elected representatives from each community's resi- dent board who agreed to participate.Two CHANGE ini- tiative personnel also served as members to help facilitate the twelve CAB monthly meetings.
The CAB members re- ceived a small stipend for participation in promoting the program, completing community assessments, providing input on changes to create environments supportive of healthy lifestyle behaviors, and on strategies to overcome barriers to receiving cancer screening and follow- up care. 2.3 | CHANGE intervention The CHANGE intervention was composed of four educa- tion sessions completed in a group setting and facilitated by trained research staff (Figure 1).One session was pre- sented weekly for four weeks.Each session lasted approx- imately 90 minutes.Facilitator and participant manuals were reviewed by the CAB and content experts; and were written at an 8th grade literacy level.Facilitators are trained research staff (n = 4, 100% female, 50% non- White, all facilitators had at least a bachelors in a health- related field) who assisted in the development of the program ma- terials and received education on effective teaching meth- ods.
A facilitator's guide with scripts for each session at KEYWORDS African Americans, breast cancer, cancer prevention, cancer screening, cigarette smoking, colon cancer, health equity, obesity, prostate cancer, racial disparities, screening | 3 of 10 VERNON et al. each site were also provided and utilized for fidelity to the program.Sessions were held in a classroom or community room at each respective site.Two days prior to each session, in- tervention participants received either a reminder call or text reminder (based on personal preference).A virtual option was also made available for participants, involving self- directed learning with the participant manual and on- line video tutorials.Participants received a physical participant man- ual provided to them at the initial session.Each session was facilitated by trained staff, and began with a review followed by the presentation of a new topic lasting ap- proximately 30 minutes.
After each session, project team members called any absent participants to assess barriers to attendance, review any missing material, and remind them of the upcoming session. Session 1 Fight for your Life, what is cancer?The CHANGE program was introduced, and information shared about what cancer is, common causes, incidence and prevalence was defined, and relevant local and state numbers were presented, risk factors for cancer, and their individual cancer risk were also presented and discussed.The American Cancer Society screening recommenda- tions for various cancers, including the benefits of genetic testing was also presented.Tobacco cessation resources were shared, and current smokers were also navigated to Georgia Cancer Center's evidence- based cessation ser- vices.The session ended with a guided family health his- tory to evaluate familial genetic cancer risk.Session 2 Prostate Cancer, Breast Cancer, and Colorectal Cancer.
Participants learned about prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer, the benefits of early detection, signs and symptoms, and treatment options. Participants also learned about specific cancer incidence, prevalence, and disparities.Specific genetic, behavioral, and environmen- tal risk factors and risk factor reduction for themselves and their families were also discussed.Session 3 Obesity and overweight as risk factors for cancer.Obesity and overweight as risk factors for cancers and risk reducing behaviors for participants and their families were also discussed.
The impact of nutrition and physical activity on reducing cancer risk and the im- pact of early childhood development of overweight will be presented, along with strategies and tools to develop healthy lifestyle behaviors.FIGURE 1 Flow diagram of study process.Screened (n=130) Eligible andconse ntedpar cipant s (n=90)NotEligible (n=3) 1duetonotlivinga t thec ommunity 2wereolderthan 80 Enro llmen tandBaseline Measures comple ted (Health metrics andsurveys,n=90) Weekly par cipa onatCHANGE sessions (Aende datleast 3sessions, n=67) Post-intervenonmeasures complete d (Health metrics andsurveys,n=59) 3month followuponCance rscreening uptake (n=50) 4 of 10 | VERNON et al. Session 4.Cancer Myths & Cancer Care Connections.Participants will learn common myths about cancer.Supportive community resources for cancer patients and their families will be presented.All participants received a printed copy of the CHANGE resource guide for this mod- ule.The concept of navigation was introduced.
Progress in cancer treatment with an emphasis on minority par- ticipation in clinical trials was also highlighted. This ses- sion ended with an interactive game that summarized key points of all sessions.Participants developed a personal action plan related to risk reduction and screening.2.4 | Assessment of Eligibility for Cancer Screenings As part of the first session, participants completed a guided family health history to assess familial risk of can- cer (immediate and extended family history of cancer, cancer type, and age at diagnosis if known) and completed simple screening questions to evaluate eligibility for pros- tate, breast, and CRC screenings.
All eligibility guidelines utilized the screening criteria defined by the American Cancer Society when evaluating eligibility for screening.5 Prostate cancer screening eligibility was determined by: AA men 45 and older who have not discussed screening with a doctor, family history of prostate cancer before age 65, and with the following questions: “Have you ever had a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test?” (yes/no), “If yes, when was your most recent one?” (less than or 1 year ago, more than 1 year ago). Breast cancer screen- ing eligibility was determined by: women 45 or older who have not had a mammogram in the last year with the fol- lowing questions: “Have you ever had a mammogram?” (yes/no), If yes, when was your most recent one?(Less than 1 year ago, between 1 and 5 years ago, or more than 5 years ago).
Colorectal cancer screening was determined by the following criteria: 45 through 75, older than 75 with a recommendation of their physician, those who have not had a colonoscopy in the last 10 years or a FIT (fecal immunochemical test) in the last year, with the fol- lowing questions: “Have you ever had a colonoscopy?” (yes/no); “If yes, when was your most recent one?” (less than 1 year ago, between 1 and 5 years ago, between 6 and 10 years ago, more than 10 years ago). In addition, participants completed a self- assessment of their personal cancer risk factors, adapted from the American Cancer Society's Lifestyle Behaviors and Risk Factors quiz (currently, this is available at cancer.gov as part of the Crucial Catch initiative).
Participants who identified 3 or more risk factors (including family history, tobacco use, dietary habits, obesity, family history and sedentary lifestyle) were considered “high risk.”If screenings were appropriate, participants were flagged for further follow- up. Eligible participants were offered referrals to screening by project staff.Family history indicative of other cancers resulted in person- alized recommendations.High risk participants were contacted by study staff, and referral options discussed and offered.A letter outlining their self- reported risk factors was provided to take to their primary care phy- sician.Three- month follow- ups were conducted for participants with high risk factors or who were due for a screening, to evaluate whether follow- up care had been accessed.Those who accepted referrals were provided eligi- bility about cancer screening materials provided by the Georgia Cancer Center, Cancer Information and Awareness resources.
These resources utilized National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society re- sources. These were provided along with a letter from the study to discuss with their primary care physician.If the participant did not have a primary care physi- cian, they were referred with permission to the Georgia Cancer Center (GCC) patient navigators, who could also aid with scheduling and transportation.Participants were also provided information on accessing cancer screenings – this included availability of clinics in the Augusta area, information about when and where to go for breast, prostate, and colorectal screening, and infor- mation about what to expect at each screening (this was also discussed in session two).2.5 | Assessment of Eligibility for Tobacco Cessation Participants self- identified current smoking and/or other tobacco use.Current tobacco users were encouraged to quit.
Those who agreed were referred to the GCC tobacco cessation services, a no cost evidenced- based tobacco treatment program that includes four sessions (once a week) of counseling services and pharmacotherapy for 6 to 12 weeks depending on the level of nicotine addic- tion. Three months after the intervention, these individu- als were contacted by telephone to determine if they had quit (or were in the process of quitting) and if there were any additional needs they may have had to be successful in quitting.2.6 | Follow- up Three months after the intervention, individuals flagged for cancer screening were contacted to determine if they had either obtained appropriate screening or discussed | 5 of 10 VERNON et al.the screening with their healthcare provider.
If a partici- pant indicated a desire for cancer screenings but lacked the resources to pay for it, additional contact was facili- tated with the with the GCC patient navigators to identify local resources to assist them, including the GCC and the Georgia Department of Public Health. 2.7 | Data Collection At baseline (one to two weeks prior to classes starting) and within one week of completing the educational sessions, participant data was collected at each respective site.This included sociodemographic data (baseline only) and rel- evant health information such as cancer history and can- cer risk factors including history of tobacco use, as well as information about cancer screening history.This infor- mation allowed us to determine whether the participant was a potential candidate for prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer screening.
At baseline and immediate post- test, we assessed par- ticipants' cancer knowledge, attitudes and beliefs con- cerning cancer, personal cancer- related health behaviors such as smoking, healthy eating and physical activity behaviors, self- efficacy, perceived cancer risk and cancer fears, and current awareness of cancer screening recom- mendations (adapted from the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey [ HINTS]).6 Questions about breast cancer knowledge were adapted from the CDC's “Breast Cancer Quiz”,7 and the American Cancer Society Breast Cancer Quiz (https:// www. cancer.org/ cancer/ types/ breas t- cancer/ breas t- cance r- quiz.html),8 colorectal cancer knowledge questions were adapted from the CDC “Colorectal Cancer Quiz” (https:// www.cdc.gov/ cancer/ color ectal/ quiz/ index.
html),9 and prostate cancer knowledge survey items were used from the American Cancer Society, “Prostate Cancer Quiz”.10 Obesity and overweight knowledge questions were adapted from in- formation in the National Cancer Institute's Obesity and Cancer page.11 Participant satisfaction with course materi- als was also assessed (post- test only). All participants had their height, weight, waist and hip circumference measured at baseline and post- intervention by trained staff.All measures were repeated at least twice and retained within the standard of error.An average of the two metrics was retained for analy- sis.Body mass index (BMI) and waist/hip circumference were calculated as obesity screening measures.All sur- veys were created in Flexicapture to allow for scannable data entry of questionnaires and biometrics.
Participants received a $25 gift card after completing baseline assess- ments and a $50 gift card when completing the post- intervention assessments.2.8 | Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis focused on evaluating the pre and post- intervention changes in participant knowledge and behaviors related to cancer prevention, risk factors, and screenings. Data was evaluated pre/post, to evaluate a hy- pothesized increase in increase in knowledge and positive health behaviors after completing the program.Paired T- tests, Chi- Square, and ANOVA tests were used.All statis- tical tests were two- tailed and used a significance level of 0.05.The study was approved by the Augusta University Institutional Review Board and all participants completed informed consent prior to enrollment.3 | RESULTS 3.1 | Demographics Ninety participants completed informed consent and baseline measures (Table 1).A majority of the partici- pants were African/Back American (88%).
Six percent of the participants were younger than age 45 years, 31% be- tween 45 and 64, and 57% were older than 65 years. Forty- seven percent of participants had completed high school, 12% had only completed middle school and 41% reported some or more college education.Almost 80% of partici- pants were overweight or obese, and 24% reported tobacco use.Eighty percent of participants attended at least 3 of the four sessions.At baseline, 58% (n = 41; 26 females and 15 males) of participants reported ever having a previous colon cancer screening, 77% of women had had at least one mammo- gram, and only 27% of males reported ever having a PSA screening.Among female participants, 59.5% reported plans to be checked for colon cancer at baseline and 73% reported plans at follow- up (χ2 = 2.490, p < 0.11); for males, 81.5% reported plans at baseline and 80% reported plans at follow- up (ns).
3.2 | Referrals for screening After completing cancer screening eligibility question- naires during the program sessions, 46 participants were identified as eligible for a breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer screening, genetic cancer risk due to family his- tory, or for tobacco cessation (Table 2.). Of these, 21 par- ticipants chose to have a referral made on their behalf to their primary care physician or the Georgia Cancer Center Of those eligible for cancer screening, 42% participants requested a referral for breast cancer screening, 13% for 6 of 10 | VERNON et al.prostate screening, and 40% for colorectal cancer screen- ing – some participants received more than one referral.Additionally, participants eligible for a screening reported speaking to their primary care physician about breast (50%), prostate (33%), and colorectal cancer screenings (36%).
All participants who reported tobacco use were re- ferred for tobacco cessation services – one participant died before completing tobacco cessation. At the 3- month follow- up, 6 reported discussing a mammogram with their PCP, and of those, 3 had com- pleted or had one scheduled.Two reported that their PCP did not recommend screening (reasons were not known).Five participants had discussed a prostate screening with their provider, four had either scheduled or completed one, only one did not have a screening recommended by their PCP.Nine participants reported discussing a colo- noscopy or FIT test and of these, 7 had scheduled or com- pleted one (5 males, 2 females); 2 were not recommended for screening by their PCP.One male participant reported a positive FIT result and was working with a patient nav- igator for follow- up.Of the 22 participants who reported current smoking or tobacco use at baseline, only 17 re- ported still using tobacco products at post- test.
3.3 | Knowledge, Beliefs, and Intentions Surveys A total score was created for each knowledge section of the survey, resulting in a percent correct. One third of partici- pants demonstrated improved knowledge of breast cancer risk and screening information, although this was not sig- nificant; men showed greater improvement in knowledge than women (Table 3).Twenty- two percent of female TABLE 1 Demographics (n = 90).Sex Male 33 (33%) Female 57 (64%) Race African American/Black 84 (93%) White 5 (6%) American Indian/Alaska Native 1 (1%) Age 45 and younger 6 (7%) 46–64 30 (33%) 65 and older 54 (60%) Education Less than high school 9 (10%) High school/GED 54 (60%) Greater than high school 25 (28%) Prefer not to answer 2 (2%) BMI Underweight 1 (1%) Normal 14 (19%) Overweight 16 (22%) Obese 41 (57%) Tobacco use Tobacco user 22 (24%) Non- user 68 (76%) Site participation Site 1 20 Site 2 5 Site 3 18 Site 4 21 Site 5 26 TABLE 2 Eligibility and referral for cancer screening.

Overall, knowledge about pros- tate cancer risk factors and screening types also improved, but not significantly; there was no difference between men and women (Table 4.). No significant improvement was observed for colorectal cancer knowledge among all participants; women demonstrated greater improvement than men, but the difference was not significant (Table 5).Paired t- tests showed significant improvement for obesity/overweight knowledge questions between visit 1 and visit 2 (Mean improvement in score = 23.9%, t = −4.495, p < 0.001) (Table 6).Women demonstrated greater improvement in scores than men (28% vs.17%, NS).Age and education cat- egories were not significantly different between groups on knowledge questions.At baseline, 12% of females reported “often,” or “al- ways” worry about getting breast cancer, and 14% of males reported worry about getting prostate cancer.28% of males and 12% of females reported worry about get- ting colon cancer.
At post- test, 19% of females reported worry “often,” or “always,” about getting breast can- cer, 14% of males worried about prostate cancer; 10% of males and 14% of females reported worry about getting colon cancer. At baseline, 83% of females reported an intention to get a mammogram and 11% were undecided; at post- test, 89% of women intended to get a mammogram and 7% were undecided.81% of males and 59.5% of females indicated an intention to be checked for colon cancer.At post- test, 73% of females and 81% of males reported intentions to TABLE 4 Prostate cancer knowledge.

3.4 | Changes in Health Behaviors At pre- test, 10 respondents reported current smoking be- haviors (whether it was cigarettes, e- cigarettes, or other forms of tobacco). At post- test, 3 of those participants re- ported no longer smoking.In total, six participants were referred to the Georgia Cancer Center Tobacco Cessation Clinic.The decrease in smoking behaviors was a signifi- cant difference (χ2 = 34.163, p < 0.001).Respondents reported a significant increase in daily consumption of more than three servings of fruit (14% to 18%, χ2 = 16.078, p < 0.003) servings; those who reported more than three servings of vegetables (20%) per day re- mained the same between pre and post.Significantly more respondents reported physical activity at least once a week at post- test (58% vs 78%), (χ2 = 5.979, p < 0.014).
More respondents reported physical activity on three or more days per week at post- test (52.1%) compared to pre- test (44.7%) (χ2 = 35.627, p < 0.017).4 | DISCUSSION This four- week education intervention, coupled with navigation to screening and referral for care significantly improved participants’ knowledge about cancer, attitudes and beliefs concerning cancer, personal cancer- related health behaviors such as smoking, health eating and phys- ical activity behaviors, self- efficacy, perceived cancer risk and cancer fears, and current awareness of cancer screen- ing recommendations. We found that women showed greater improvement in cancer knowledge compared to men regarding overweight and obesity risk with cancer, colorectal cancer, and men showed greater improvement in knowledge related to breast cancer information.
This is important as African- American men and women are a greater risk of having late diagnosed breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer and men typically do not adhere to screening guidelines when compared to women, as dem- onstrated in our qualitative results (Vernon, 2022). The findings that age and education were not associated with changes in knowledge may be due to the fact that our sam- ple was more homogenous in other social determinants of health than larger samples outside of the public housing community setting.Participants demonstrated significant improvements in modifiable risk factors and behaviors for cancer – to- bacco use and obesity through changes in nutrition and physical activity.This is particularly significant as this program only offered education, but no direct interven- tion on these modifiable behaviors.Study limitations included accessibility issues and self- report metrics.
At some sites, it was difficult to recruit sufficient participants who could participate at our meet- ing times, which were determined by building space and Augusta Housing Authority staff availability. For some participants, we were able to conduct follow- up sessions individually with facilitators and we also provided at least two sessions of the program at each site.All participants received the written educational guide at the conclusion of the program for reference and referral.During the pan- demic, we developed a virtual component of the education program, yet, most did not have access to devices or tech- nical knowledge to watch videos online or answer survey questions in a digital platform.However, this pivot has allowed us to create an almost completely digital version of the program for future dissemination and expansion of the project.
Reports of uptake of cancer screening were self- reported and not independently verified, as the study did not have access to participant medical records. Acceptability of the education sessions was not formally measured.However, we have informally collected ev- idence of acceptability through participant feedback TABLE 6 Overweight and obesity knowledge.Percent correct Pre- test (%)Post- test (%) Being overweight or obese puts one at higher risk of cancer75 98 Minority persons have more cancer related to obesity.67 81 Too much body fat can increase growth hormones, which can cause cancer77 92 Adults are considered obese if they weight 30 or 40 pounds above their ideal weight79 94 As far as you know, does being overweight or obese affect the risk of developing the following types of cancer?

Another study sought to increase CRC screening, physical activity, and multivitamin use in public housing residents, and re- ported that residents were interested in more education on cancer screening.18 Residents of these communities are often from underserved racial, minority, and finan- cial groups. Interventions of this type and intensity are particu- larly beneficial to underserved and marginalized com- munities who experience significant disparities due to socioeconomic and access issues.By increasing knowl- edge, improving attitudes and beliefs, and providing tools to encourage conversation with providers, more eligible adults are equipped with the tools to be active participants in their preventive health care.These re- sults support the implication that knowledge builds trust – exemplified by the increase in participants re- porting conversations with their providers about ac- cessing cancer screenings.
Similar populations are not often reached by traditional or mainstream educational outreach evidenced by a lack of access to the internet and computer devices. Simple replicable, readable, and personal educational outreach has the additional bene- fit of improving trust among populations who often do not have confidence that they will receive quality care.Training community health workers to deliver the cur- riculum will also increase sustainability in the program.Future expansion of this project into other residential communities including public housing, mixed housing, and retiree communities may also improve underserved community knowledge about cancer, cancer risks, and their access to care.
PRECIS The Cancer Health Awareness through screeNinG and Education (CHANGE) initiative is designed to deliver cancer awareness education, with an emphasis on modi- fiable risk factors, and navigation to screening for pros- tate, breast, and colorectal cancers to residents of public housing communities who experience significant nega- tive social determinants of health. CHANGE participants demonstrated improved health knowledge and intentions to improve their modifiable health behaviors.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Marlo Vernon: Conceptualization (equal); data cu- ration (equal); formal analysis (equal); funding ac- quisition (equal); investigation (equal); methodology (equal); project administration (equal); supervision (lead); writing – original draft (lead); writing – review and editing (lead).Steven S.Coughlin: Funding ac- quisition (supporting); writing – original draft (equal); writing – review and editing (equal).
