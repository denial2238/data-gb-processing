4In the assay system of endothelial permeability, supplementation with 5m mCR significantly suppressed the endothelial permeability induced by serotonin and H 2O2. 5In cell adhesion experiments, supplementation with 5m mCR significantly suppressed neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells.6In the measurement of adhesion molecules, CR supplementation with more than 0.5m mCR significantly inhibited the expressions of ICAM-1 and E-selectin on endothelial cells, and theinhibition was significantly suppressed by an adenosine A 2Areceptor antagonist.7The present study suggests that CR supplementation has anti-inflammatory activities against endothelial cells.British Journal of Pharmacology (2003) 139,715–720.

Cells take in CR from the blood stream through a CR transporter and store it as CR and its phosphorylated form, phosphocreatine(PC) (Snow &Murphy,2001).CR receives aphosphoryl groupfrom ATP to generate PC by using the CR kinase inside cells.
Intracellular ATP has such a short half-life that cells are equipped with two major channels of ATP supply. One isglycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation; the other is the PC energy system.While the former constantly provides ATP, the latter works on acute demand as an energy buffer to maintainan intracellular ATP level.Because PC transfers the phos- phoryl group to ADP to synthesize ATP quickly, the total amount of ATP and PC represents an intracellular energypool.The PC energy system is well characterized in the case of skeletal muscle cells because about 94% of CR is distributed therein (Wyss & Kaddurah-Daouk, 2000).It is known that supplementation with high-dose CR further increases intracellular energy pools of muscle tissue as well asserum CR levels in vivo.Ingestion of high-dose CR up to 20g increases CR serum levels to 2m min a dose-dependent manner (Schedelet al., 1999).
Moreover, supplementation with more than 20g of CR has been reported to increase the intracellularcontents of both CR and PC (Vandenberghe etal., 1997; Snow et al., 1998). Furthermore, some reports suggest that the increase in intracellular energy pools enhances progress in muscle strength (Vandenberghe et al., 1997; Williams & Branch, 1998), although opposite results have also been reported (Snow et al., 1998; Vandenberghe et al., 1999).Therefore, many athletes are taking high-dose CR to buildmuscular strength.Recently, CR supplementation has also been applied to the treatment of various pathological conditions such as gyrate atrophy (Sipila ¨et al., 1981; Vannas-Sulonen et al., 1985), McArdle disease (Vorgerd et al., 2000), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Felber et al., 2000), myasthenia gravis (Stout et al., 2001), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Mazzini etal., 2001).
Findings in these reports suggest that CR supplementation augments or restores cell functions by increasing intracellular energy pools. The PC energy system and CR supplementation have been extensively investigated in muscle cells, but not in endothelial *Author for correspondence; E-mail: kiyo-se@md.tsukuba.ac.jp British Journal of Pharmacology (2003) 139, 715–720 &2003 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved 0007–1188/03 $25.00 www.nature.com/bjp cells.To our knowledge, there have been only a few reports on the presence of PC and ATP in endothelial cells (Loike et al., 1992; Windischbauer et al., 1994).It remains to be elucidated whether CR supplementation may influence the cell functionsof endothelial cells.In this study, we postulated that CR supplementation may inhibit inflammation in endothelial cells by increasing intracellular high-energy phosphate compounds.
Methods Coating Millicell-CM with gelatin Millicell-CM with a 0.4 mm pore-size (12mm, 0.6cm2) was briefly covered with 2% gelatin solution containing 5% sucrose, dried after removing the solution, and washed with sterilized 0.15 mphosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 10min. The membrane was fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde solution for 30min, washed with PBS5times, andincubated in 0.1mglycine solution for 30min.The coated membrane was used for the culture of endothelial cells after being washed with PBS and subsequent culture medium.Culture of endothelial cells We first determined the CR concentration of endothelial cellbasal medium (EBM)-2 containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), and found it 2.85 70.62mm(n¼6).We used 5% FCS- containing EBM-2 supplemented with 50 mmCR as a basal culture medium in following experiments because endothelial cells are constantly exposed to 50 mmCRin vivo.
Human endothelial cells from pulmonary peripheral vessels wereseeded at 2.5 /C210 4cellscm/C02on six-well plastic plates and on gelatin-coated Millicell-CM membranes for quantification of CR, PC, and ATP, and for assay of permeability, respectively. Cells were cultured in a CO 2incubator until a confluent monolayer formed, and were then subjected to the following experiments.In the case of the Millicell-CM membranes, 400and 600 ml of the medium were added to the inner and outer chambers, respectively, to balance the liquid levels.Characterization of cultured endothelial cells To characterize the cultured endothelial cells, we examined theuptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the expression of Factor VIII, which parameters can demonstrate the character-istics of endothelial cells.
Uptake of LDL was examined histochemically by incubat- ing cells in media containing 10 mgml /C01of LDL labeled with 1,10-dioctadecyl-3,3,30,30-tetramethylindo-carbocyanine per- chlorate (Dil-Ac-LDL) for 4h at 37 1C. Labeled cells were washed with media free of Dil-Ac-LDL several times then observed under a fluorescence microscope IX70 (Olympus,Japan) at 514nm for excitation and at 550nm for emission.Expression of Factor VIII on cultured cells was examined immunohistochemically with a rabbit anti-human Factor VIIIpolyclonal antibody using Histofine Simple Stain MAX PO (MULTI).In brief, cells were fixed in 4% ice-cold parafor- maldehyde solution for 10min at 4 1C, and endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated in 100% methanol contain-ing 0.3% H 2O2for 30min at room temperature.After nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation of specimenswith 2% goat sera for 30min, specimens were incubated with a primary antibody (10 mgml/C01) for 30min.
Then they were incubated with Universal Immuno-peroxidase Polymer con- jugated with anti-rabbit antibodies and peroxidases for 10min.Color development wasconductedwith 3, 3 0-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride for 10min. Specimens were washed three times with 0.5 mPBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 between steps.Measurement of CR CR was quantified according to the method in a previousreport (Yasuhara et al., 1982).Two enzymatic solutions, Reagents I and II, were prepared and kept on ice before assay of creatine.Reagent I was 0.1 mPBS (pH 7.8) containing 3Uml /C01sarcosine oxidase, 0.3Uml/C01formaldehyde dehydro- genase, and 0.1m mb-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (b-NADþ).Reagent II was 20Uml/C01creatine amidinohydro- lase dissolved in 0.1 mPBS.In brief, 20 ml of standard CR solution or of the sample was added to 50 ml of 0.1 mPBS containing 3Uml/C01of sarcosine oxidase, 0.3Uml/C01of formaldehyde dehydrogenase, and 0.1m mofb-NADþ, and incubated for 5min at 37 1C.
Then 50 mlo f2 0Um l/C01creatine amidinohydrolase in 0.1 mPBS was added to the reaction mixture. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was read at340nm with an ultraviolet analyzer Ultrospec 3000 (Nippon Bio-Rad Laboratories, Japan).Measurement of PC Assay of PC consisted of two processes (Loike et al., 1979).First, ATP was eliminated from the samples by incubation ofthe reaction mixture at 37 1C for 5min.The reaction mixture contained 30 ml of sample and 350 ml of buffer made with 36 ml of 10m mAMP, 9 ml of 100 mmADP, 36 ml of firefly extract, 23ml of distilled water, and 246 mlo f1 0 m mphosphate in 100m msodium arsenite buffer (pH 7.4) containing 4m m MgSO 4.Second, PC was converted to ATP by incubation of the reaction mixture with 50 ml of 5mgml/C01creatinepho- sphokinase, and its chemiluminescence was measured at 4 1C for 10min by a luminometer BLR-301 (Aloka, Japan).
Measurement of ATP The level of ATP was determined by the luciferin–luciferase method (Strehler & McElroy, 1957; Beutler & Baluda, 1964)with an ATP Assay Kit. In brief, 200 ml of sample or ATP standard was mixed with 200 mlo f2 5m mHEPES (pH 7.75) containing 10m mMgCl 2and 0.02% NaN 3along with 100 mlo f luciferase solution.Chemiluminescence of the mixture wasmeasured at 4 1C for 1min.Measurement of protein Protein was quantified according to Lowry’s method with the use of a DC protein assay kit (Lowry etal., 1951).A volume of 200ml of the sample or bovine serum albumin as a standard protein was mixed with 100 ml of mixture containing reagents A and S at a 50:1 ratio, to which was added 800 ml of reagent B,then theabsorbance ofthe mixturewasmeasuredat750nm.716 A.
Nomura et al Creatine supplementation suppresses inflammation British Journal of Pharmacology vol 139 (4) Effect of exogenously added CR on intracellular CR, PC, and ATP Endothelial cells were cultured up to confluence using EBM-2 containing 5% FCS and 0.5m mCR with or without 5m m b-guanidinopropionic acid (GPA) on six-well plastic plates. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing4.1mmMg 2þand 2.5m mCa2þ, and harvested with a cell scraper after the addition of 500 ml of ice-cold 0.04 mTris- borate buffer (pH 9.2).Cell suspensions were boiled for 5minto inactivate ATPase, then centrifuged at 1200 /C2gfor 5min at 41C.Supernatants were subjected to measurement of CR, PC, and ATP, and pellets were resuspended in 1% sodium dodecylsulfate for measurement of protein.Samples werestored at /C0801C until assay.
Effect of CR supplementation on endothelial permeability induced by serotonin and H 2O2 Endothelial permeability was measured under stimulation with serotonin or H 2O2using fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dex, MW 70kD) as a tracer according to the method described in previous reports (Simionescu & Palade, 1971;Hashidaetal., 1986). In brief, FITC-dex (1.4mg) was added to the inner chamber to reach a final concentration of 50 mm, and serotonin or H 2O2was added to the outer chamber to reach a final concentration of 0.1 mm.Fluorescence in 20 ml of medium removed from an outer chamber was measured at 0, 30, 90, 180, and 240min by Biolumin 960TM fluorometer (Molecular Dynamics Japan, Japan).The content of FITC-dex in sampleswas calculated using a standard curve of FITC-dex.Endothe- lial permeability was expressed as the content of FITC-dex (mg) permeating into the outer chamber.
Endothelial cells were cultured in a culture medium containing 0.05, 0.5, and 5m mof CR for 24h before assay of endothelial permeability. After incubation with exogenously added CR, cultured cells were equilibrated in Hank’s balancedsaline solution (HBSS) then subjected to the endothelial permeability assay.To examine the role of a CR transporter in the effect of extracellular CR, GPA was added to themedium at 5m m.Labeling of neutrophils with51Cr Human neutrophils were separated using Histopaque-1077 and Histopaque-1119 according to the method of English(English & Andersen, 1974), and were suspended in PBS freeof Mg 2þand Ca2þ.Neutrophils were dispensed at 6 /C2105cells per tube, then labeled with51Cr by reacting with 3.7MBq of Na251CrO4in the presence of 1 mmn-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP)for40mininaCO 2incubator(Balazovich etal., 1996; Chen & Christou, 1996).
Labeled neutrophils were washed twice with HBSS containing 0.9m mMg2þand 1.26m mCa2þ, then resuspended in EBM-2 for the following experiment. Effect of CR supplementation on neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells Neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells was assessed as reported previously (Ishii et al., 2002).Endothelial cells were preincubated in 0.05, 0.5, and 5m mCR for 24h in a CO 2 incubator.After washing out the CR, endothelial cells werestimulated with 25ngml/C01of TNF- afor 3h.A volume of 100mlo f51Cr-labeled neutrophils (corresponding to 8.5 /C2104 cells) were reacted to endothelial cells for 30min in a CO 2 incubator, then washed with HBSS free of Mg2þand Ca2þto remove nonadherent neutrophils.Adherent cells were lysed by 200mlo f1 nNaOH to measure radioactivity.Neutrophil adhesion was calculated by dividing the radioactivity ofadherent neutrophils by that of total neutrophils.
Effect of CR supplementation on adhesion expression on endothelial cells Endothelial cells supplemented with 0.05, 0.5, and 5m mCR for 24h were stimulated with TNF- afor 3h in the presence andthe absence of 1 mmZM241385.The expressionsof ICAM- 1 and E-selectin were measured semiquantitatively as reported by Mulligan etal. (1993).The cells were fixed with ice-cold 1% paraformaldehyde solution for 10min, then incubated in 10%skimmed milk to inhibit the nonspecific adsorption of antibodies.Fixed cells were incubated with a mouse anti- human E-selectin IgG, a mouse anti-human ICAM-1 IgG1, ora mouse control IgG1 at 5 mgml /C01for 45min at room temperature.The cells were washed with PBS three times, and incubated with a peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-mouseIgG at 1:500 dilution for 10min.After brief washes, cells were incubated in 0.4mgml /C01ofo-phenylenediamine solution for 30min.
Color development was stopped by 3 mH2SO4, and the absorbance (OD) was read at 492nm and taken to representthe relative expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin.

All other materials were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Japan). Statistical analysis All data are given as the mean 7one s.e.m.Statistical comparisons were performed by one-way analysis of variance.If a significant variance was detected, individual group differences were determined by Bonferroni post-test.AA.Nomura et al Creatine supplementation suppresses inflammation 717 British Journal of Pharmacology vol 139 (4) probability value less than 0.05was regarded as statistically significant.Results Characteristics of cultured endothelial cells Cultured cells assembled in a confluent monolayer with acobblestone-like appearance in a week.All the cells werepositive for LDL uptake and the immunoreactivity of Factor VIII, indicating that cultured cells were pure endothelial cells.
Intracellular contents of CR, PC, and ATP Culturing endothelial cells in 0.5m mCR for 24h significantly increased intracellular contents of CR and PC, and the effects of CR supplementation were significantly suppressed by the CR transporter antagonist GPA (Figure 1). In contrast, theintracellular content of ATP was not affected by CRsupplementation and GPA.Effect of CR supplementation on endothelial permeability induced by serotonin and H 2O2 Basal endothelial permeability was increased up to 240min in a time-dependent manner.Stimulation with serotonin and H2O2significantly increased endothelial permeability up to 180min.In this system, agonist-induced increases in endothe-lial permeability were not significant at 240min, because basal permeability was found to reach submaximal permeability.Therefore, we assessed endothelial permeability at 180min inthe following experiments.
It was observed that 5m mCR significantly inhibited the endothelial permeability induced by 0.1 mmserotonin (Figure 2). A measure of 5m mCR was also observed to significantly inhibit the endothelial permeability induced by 0.1mmH 2O2(Figure 3).Although not significantly, 0.5m mCR slightly inhibited the permeability induced by both stimuli.Even 5m mof CR did not decrease permeability below basal permeability.Effect of CR supplementation on neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells Adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells was increased from 18.3 to 32.7% by TNF- a(Figure 4).TNF- a-induced adhesion of neutrophils was significantly inhibited to 18.6%by 5m mof CR supplementation.Effect of CR supplementation on the expressions of ICAM-1 and E-selection on endothelial cells Control antibody-treated endothelial cells showed no signifi- cant absorbance.
The relative expressions of ICAM-1 and E- selectin were significantly increased from 0.36 OD to 0.58 OD and from 0.43 OD to 0.89 OD by TNF- a, respectively (Figures 5and 6). More than 0.5 m mof CR supplementation significantly suppressed the expressions of ICAM-1 and E- selectin in a dose-dependent manner.The inhibition of bothexpressions by 5m mCR was significantly suppressed by ZM241385.Discussion In this study, we examined the effect of CR supplementation on endothelial cell parameters in vitro, and found that it inhibited endothelial permeability, neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, and adhesion molecule expression.It is020406080Contents of ATP, CR, and PC (nmol/mg protein)* *** ATP CR PC supplemented with 0.05 mM CR supplemented with 0.5 mM CR supplemented with 0.5 mM CR in the presence of GPA Figure 1 Effect of CR supplementation on intracellular contents of CR, PC, and ATP.Asterisks indicate Po0.05(n¼5).

Nomura et al Creatine supplementation suppresses inflammation British Journal of Pharmacology vol 139 (4) suggested that CR supplementation may serve as a suppressor of inflammation at the endothelial cell level. It is highly possible that the PC energy system is active in endothelial cells, based on the fact that a few reportsdemonstrated that endothelial cells of umbilical veins con-tained PC (Loike et al., 1992; Windischbauer et al., 1994).However, those previous reports did not show intracellular CR levels or the role of CR in endothelial cells.We first measuredthe intracellular CR to assess whether CR might exist inside cultured endothelial cells.We demonstrated a significant level of intracellular CR, and found that CR supplementationfurther increased it through a CR transporter.Endothelial cells were also found to contain a sufficient amount of high-energy phosphate compounds.
The contents ofPC and ATP were 44 and 30nmolmgprotein /C01, respectively, which are three to five times higher than their contents in umbilical endothelial cells (Loike et al., 1992). The reason for the difference is unknown, but it might depend uponlocalization or functions of endothelial cells.On the other hand, muscle cells have been reported to contain more high- energy phosphate compounds than endothelial cells do.ATP isa requisite for muscle cells to constrict.In addition, muscle cells are equipped with the PC energy system to prevent ATP depletion.Such evidence suggests that the PC energy system isactive in endothelial cells, although its role is unclear.Extracellular CR is tightly linked to intracellular energy pools in myocardial and skeletal muscle cells (Seraydarian andArtaza, 1976).On the other hand, we demonstrated that CRsupplementation stimulates endothelial cells to generateintracellular PC by CR uptake through a CR transporter.
These findings, taken together, suggest that most cells, including muscle and endothelial cells, might be equipped with the mechanism by which CR supplementation inducesintracellular energy pools. However, the capacity of PC biosynthesis is likely to differ among cell types.CR supple- mentation was found to increase the PC concentration inendothelial cells to 74nmolmgprotein /C01, which value was comparable to that in skeletal muscle cells (Seraydarian and Artaza, 1976).However, PC concentration in myocardial cellshas been reported to be 107nmolmgprotein /C01after CR supplementation (Seraydarian and Artaza, 1976).In contrast with the level of PC, that of intracellular ATP was found to be unsusceptible to CR supplementation or a CR transporterantagonist.Given that PC can provide ATP immediately on demand, these findings suggest that CR supplementation increases intracellular energy pools in endothelial cells throughthe PC energy system.
We hypothesized that CR supplementation might influence endothelial functions by augmenting intracellularenergy pools, and examined the effect of CR supplementation on endothelial permeability, neutrophil adhesion to endothe- lial cells, and the expression of adhesion molecules.Supplementation with 5m mCR significantly inhibited en- dothelial permeability independent of the type of stimulus used. In addition, CR supplementation was found to inhibit the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells.Thisinhibition can be partly explained by adhesion molecule suppression; CR supplementation suppressed both ICAM-1 and E-selectin expressions on endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner.There is a possibility that ATP released from endothelial cells may be involved in the CR supplementation-inducedinhibition of endothelial permeability, neutrophil adhesion toendothelial cells, and the expression of adhesion molecules.
It has been reported that endothelial cells release ATP during acute inflammation or shear stress (Bodin & Burnstock, 1998;2001). Like endothelial cells, epithelial cells have also been reported to release ATP (Knight et al., 2002).Furthermore, adenosine has been shown to have an inhibitory activity against endothelial permeability and adhe- sion molecule expression through the adenosine A 2Areceptor (Haselton et al., 1993; Okusa et al., 2000; McPherson et al., 2001).We also demonstrated that the adenosine A 2Areceptor antagonist suppressed the CR supplementation-mediated inhibition of adhesion molecule expressions.Taken together,CR supplementation may enhance ATP release from endothe-lial cells by increasing PC storage, resulting in anti-inflamma- tory activities through the adenosine A 2Areceptor against endothelial cells.In summary, CR supplementation inhibited endothelial permeability, neutrophil adhesion, and adhesion molecule expression on cultured endothelial cells.
Findings in thepresent study suggest that CR supplementation might inhibit endothelial cell-mediated inflammation by increasing intracel- lular PC contents.
