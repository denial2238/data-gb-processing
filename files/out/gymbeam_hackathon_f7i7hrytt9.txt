Vitamin B6 Acquisition and Metabolism in Schistosoma mansoni Akram A.Da ’dara1, Manal Elzoheiry1,2, Samar N.El-Beshbishi2and Patrick J.Skelly1* 1Molecular Helminthology Laboratory, Department of Infectious Disease and Global Health, Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, Tufts University, North Grafton, MA, United States,2Department of Medical Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt Schistosomes are parasitic platyhelminths that currently infect >200 million people globally.The adult worms can live within the vasculature of their hosts for many yearswhere they acquire all nutrients necessary for their survival and growth.In this work wefocus on how Schistosoma mansoni parasites acquire and metabolize vitamin B6, whose active form is pyridoxal phosphate (PLP).We show here that live intravascular stageparasites (schistosomula and adult males and females) can cleave exogenous PLP toliberate pyridoxal.
Of the three characteriz ed nucleotide-metabolizing ectoenzymes expressed at the schistosome surface (SmAP, SmNPP5, and SmATPDase1), onlySmAP hydrolyzes PLP. Heat-inactivated recombinant SmAP can no longer cleave PLP.Further, parasites whose SmAP gene has been suppressed by RNAi are signi ﬁcantly impaired in their ability to cleave PLP compared to controls.When schistosomes areincubated in murine plasma, they alter its metabolomic pro ﬁle—the levels of both pyridoxal and phosphate increase over time, a ﬁnding consistent with the action of host-exposed SmAP acting on PLP.We hypothesize that SmAP-mediated dephosphorylation of PLPgenerates a pool of pyridoxal around the worms that can be conveniently taken in by theparasites to participate in essential, vitamin B6-driven metabolism.In addition, since hostPLP‐dependent enzymes play active roles in in ﬂammatory processes, parasite-mediated cleavage of this metabolite may serve to limit parasite-damaging in ﬂammation.
In this work we also identi ﬁed schistosome homologs of enzymes that are involved in intracellular vitamin B6 metabolism. These are pyridoxal kinase (SmPK) as well as pyridoxal phosphatephosphatase (SmPLP-Ph) and pyridox(am)ine 5 ’-phosphate oxidase (SmPNPO) and cDNAs encoding these three enzymes were cloned and sequenced.The three genesencoding these enzymes all display high relative expression in schistosomula and adultworms suggestive of robust vitamin B6 metabolism in the intravascular life stages.Keywords: pyridoxal phosphate, PLP, schistosome, parasite, ectoenzyme, alkaline phosphatase Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org February 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 622162 1Edited by: Cristina Toscano Fonseca, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Brazil Reviewed by: Alan Wilson, University of York, United Kingdom Jaap Van Hellemond, Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands *Correspondence: Patrick J.

People can become infected aftercontacting fresh water that contains free-living larval stages (cercariae). After penetrating host skin, cercariae transform into juvenile, intra-mammalian forms called schistosomula.These migrate through the bloodstream to the portal vein,where they mature into adult males and females.The adultspair and couples migrate to the blood vessels around theintestines or the bladder (depending on the species) where egglaying begins.Schistosomes can live for many years within the vasculature of their hosts where they acquire all nutrients necessary forsurvival and growth.While the worms have a mouth and a gut,many metabolites are imported into the worms directly acrosstheir host-interactive tegument (skin) ( 2,3).We have characterized schistosome te gumental proteins that are involved in the uptake and me tabolism of amino acids, glucose, and water ( 4–9).
In this work, we focus on parasite acquisition of vitamin B6 and its biochemistry in one of the threemajor schistosomes of humans —Schistosoma mansoni. Vitamin B6 comprises a group of interconvertible, chemically similar compounds called vitamers.Collectively, six vitamerscomprise vitamin B6.The active form of the vitamin is pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) which functions as a coenzyme in a wide variety of enzymatic reactions (over 140 to date) related to amino acid,glucose, and lipid metabolism ( 10,11).Vitamin B6 also participates in various non-enzymatic reactions as anantioxidant, carbonyl scavenger and metal chelator ( 12).The vitamin is critically important for normal growth, cognitive development, and immune function ( 11).Animals are auxotrophic for vitamin B6 and require it as a supplement;schistosomes must acquire this vital metabolite from their hosts.Three vitamin B6 vitamers are: pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxine (PN), and pyridoxamine (PM).
PL can be directly converted intoactive vitamin B6 (PLP) by phosphorylation viaa pyridoxal kinase enzyme ( 11,13). This kinase can similarly phosphorylate PN and PM, but an additional enzyme —Pyridox(am)ine 5 ’- Phosphate Oxidase —is required to convert these metabolites into active vitamin B6 (PLP) ( 11,13).This study was prompted by our work on how schistosomes alter the murine plasma meta bolome.When adult worms are incubated in murine plasma the levels of pyridoxal and phosphate increase over time.This observation is most easily understood if the worms have an ability to cleave any PLP that is available in theplasma, thereby generating fr ee pyridoxal and phosphate.Schistosome express three disti nct nucleotide-metabolizing ectoenzymes (NMEEs) on their external surface and wehypothesized that one of these mediated PLP cleavage.Theseenzymes are: S.mansoni ATPdiphosphohydrolase1 (SmATPDase1), S.mansoni phosphodiesterase/pyrophosphatase (SmNPP5), and S.
mansoni alkaline phosphatase, (SmAP). All three enzymes have been immunolocalized to the schistosome tegument (skin) and have been shown to be expressed at theschistosome host-interactive surface in tegument proteomicstudies ( 14–16).SmATPDase1 is an ~61 kDa apyrase that can degrade ATP and ADP in a cation dependent manner ( 17,18).SmNPP-5 is a ~53 kDa protein with a single C-terminal transmembrane domain that is exp ressed exclusively in the intra- mammalian life stages and has been shown to cleave ADP and to block platelet aggregation in vitro (19–21).SmAP is a ~60 kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed in the tegument and in the internal tissues of theintravascular worms ( 18,22).SmAP has been shown to cleave several nucleoside monophosphates including AMP, CMP, GMP and TMP ( 23).
SmAP additionally hydrolyzes the bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) ( 23)a sw e l la st h ep r o i n ﬂammatory and prothrombotic polymer, polyphosphate (polyP) ( 24). In this work, we set out to measure the ability of intravascular schistosomes to hydrolyze extracellular PLP and to determinewhich (if any) of the three NMEEs listed above is involved.Further, we identi ﬁed schistosome homologs of enzymes that are involved in vitamin B6 metabolism, cloned their cDNAs andexamined their developmental expression pro ﬁles.In this manner, the work provides insight into the acquisition andmetabolism of an essential nutrient in Schistosoma mansoni .MATERIALS AND METHODS Parasites and Mice The Puerto Rican strain of Schistosoma mansoni was used.Adult male and female parasites were recovered by perfusion from Swiss Webster mice that were infected with ~100 cercariae, 7 weeks previously ( 25).Schistosomula were prepared from cercariae released from infected snails.
All parasites werecultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 200 µg/ml streptomycin, 200 U/ml penicillin, 1 µM serotonin, 0.2 µM Triiodo-l-thyronine, 8 µg/ ml human insulin, and were maintained at 37°C, in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2(23). Parasite eggs were isolated from infected mouse liver tissue ( 25).All protocols involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittees (IACUC) of Tufts University.Pyridoxal and Phosphate Detection in Murine Plasma Blood was collected from the tail veins of 10 Swiss Webster mice into heparinized tubes.Blood cells were pelleted by briefcentrifugation and the plasma generated was pooled andaliquoted.Adult schistosomes (~50 pairs) were incubated in one 500 µl murine plasma aliquot which was incubated at 37°C.
A control aliquot (without worms) was similarly treated.Abbreviations: PL, pyridoxal; PN, pyridoxine; PM, pyridoxamine; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; SmPK, Schistosoma mansoni pyridoxal kinase; SmPNPO, Schistosoma mansoni pyridox(am)ine 5 ’-phosphate oxidase; SmPLP-Ph, Schistosoma mansoni pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase.Da’dara et al. Vitamin B6 Biochemistry in Schistosomes Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org February 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 622162 2 Samples, collected at baseline (0 min) and after 20- and 60-min incubation with or without parasites, were subjected tometabolomic analysis at Metabolon Inc.The relative levels ofpyridoxal and phosphate are described; these are extracted froma global metabolomics analysis carried out using the pipelinedeveloped by Metabolon.At least four samples per treatment/ time point were tested.
Brie ﬂy, each plasma sample was prepared by solvent extraction and the resulting extract was split into equalparts and then applied to gas chromatography/massspectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography tandem MS(LC/MS/MS) platforms ( 26). Pyridoxal and phosphate were each identi ﬁed by their retention time and mass by comparison to puriﬁed standards.Results are expressed relative to the baseline measurement (0 min), set at 1.PLP Hydrolysis by Living Parasites and by Recombinant Schistosome Enzymes To monitor PLP hydrolysis by livi ng schistosomes, schistosomula (in groups of ~2,000) or adult male or female worms (either singlyor in groups of 2 or 3) were incubated in 200 µl assay buffer (50 mMTris-HCl buffer (pH 9), 5 mM KCl, 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10mM glucose, 10 mM MgCl 2) containing 2 mM PLP (Sigma Aldrich).
Aliquots (25 µl) were recovered at selected time pointsand any phosphate generated follo wing PLP cleavage was measured using a Phosphate Colorimetric Ass ay Kit (BioVision), following the manufacturer ’s instructions. Recombinant SmAP, SmNPP5, and SmATPDase1 enzymes, expressed in CHO-S cells, were prepared as described ( 17,21,23) and each was assessed for its ab ility to cleave PLP in the assay described above.For both SmAP and SmNPP5, 0.5 µg protein was tested in each 100 µl reaction.Since SmATPDase1 is only active when expressed on the surface of CHO cells ( 17), PLP substrate was added to 10 5cells expressing SmATPDas e1 or control cells not expressing any heterologous protein.At selected time points,aliquots were recovered from all experimental conditions and anyreleased inorganic phosphate was measured using the PhosphateColorimetric Assay Kit, as above.
As a negative control, in some experiments recombinant proteins were heat treated at 95°C for 10 min before being included in activity assays. Gene Suppression Using RNAi Adult worms were electroporated with either an siRNA (10 µg)targeting SmAP (SmAP siRNA 1: 5 ’-AAGAAATCAG CAGATGAGAGATTTAAT-3 ’), or with a control siRNA that targeted no sequence in the schistosome genome (Control: 5 ’- CTTCCTCTCTTTCTCTCCCTTGTGA-3 ’) or with no siRNA, as described previously ( 22).To assess the level of target gene suppression, RNA was isolated from some worms from eachgroup two days later using the TRIzol Reagent (Thermo FisherScienti ﬁc, MA), as per the manufacturer ’s guidelines.Residual DNA was removed by DNase I digestion using a TurboDNA-free kit (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, MA).cDNA was synthesized using 1 µg RNA, an oligo (dT) 20primer and Superscript III RT (Invitrogen, CA).
Gene expression of SmAP was measured byquantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR), using custom TaqMangene expression systems from Applied Biosystems, CA usingprimers and probes, as previously ( 23,27). Alpha tubulin was used as the endogenous control gene for relative quanti ﬁcation, as described ( 28) employing the DDCt method ( 29).Results obtained from parasites treated with the irrelevant, controlsiRNA were used for calibration.For graphical representation,2 -DDCtvalues were normalized to controls and expressed as percent difference.To look for any impact of gene suppression on the ability of worms to cleave vitamin B6, PLP was added to living worms inassay buffer seven days post siRNA treatment and free phosphatelevels were measured at selected time points following theprotocol described above.
Cloning cDNAs Encoding the Vitamin B6 Metabolizing Enzymes of Schistosomes To look for homologs in schisto somes of the human enzymes that are central to vitamin B6 metabolism within cells, we used human sequences [GenBank accession number NP_003672 for pyridoxal kinase (PK, Smp_164250); NP_064711 for Pyridoxal phosphatephosphatase (PLP-Ph, Smp_ 030220) and NP_060599 for pyridox (am)ine-5 ’-phosphate oxidase (PNPO, Smp_051550)] to blast against all available “schistosomatidae ”family sequences at NCBI (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins). Clearsequence homologs were identi ﬁed in each case and were designated SmPK, SmPLP-Ph and SmPNPO, respectively.Next, primers were generated to target the entire open reading frame of each homolog.
These primers were: SmPK -F: 5 ’-ATGG CAGTTAAAGTTGCACTTAAC-3 ’,S m P K - R :5 ’-TCACATTTC TTCAACATAATCACC-3 ’;S m P L P - P h - F :5 ’-ATGACCAAG GTCGCTTCTGCGGTTCTG-3 ’, SmPLP-Ph-R: 5 ’-TTATTC TTTCAAAATATTTAAAATGTCCG-3 ’; SmPNPO-F: 5 ’-ATGCT ACGAACACTTTACTGTAGCC-3 ’, SmPNPO-R: 5 ’-CTATGGAG CTAGTCGTTCGTATACCC-3 ’. The primers were used in separate PCRs, with adult worm cDNA as template, to amplifythe complete schistosome coding sequences.All PCR products were puriﬁed, cloned into pCRII-TOPO and transformed into TOP10 E.coli (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, MA), using standard techniques.Plasmid was puri ﬁed from a selection of recombinant transformants and several plasmid DNA inserts were sequenced at Genewiz, Inc.MA.The gene encoding SmPK was identi ﬁed by BLAST analysis using the predicted coding DNA to interrogate the S.mansoni genome and NCBI databases.
Phylogenetic trees (absolute distance) were generated for each of the three schistosome proteins and homologs from a variety of organisms by UPGMA (unweighted pair group method witharithmetic mean) using Accelrys Gene 2.5 software. SmPK, SmPLP-Ph, and SmPNPO Gene Expression Analysis The levels of expression of the SmPK, SmPLP-Ph and SmPNPO genes in different life stages of the parasite was measured byreverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), using acustom TaqMan gene expression system (Applied Biosystems).RNA was isolated from different stages of the parasites usingTRIzol reagent and cDNA was synthesized as described above.The levels of expression of these genes in different life stages wasDa’dara et al.Vitamin B6 Biochemistry in Schistosomes Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org February 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 622162 3 measured by RT-qPCR using the housekeeping gene triose phosphate isomerase as the endogenous control ( 27).
Primer sets and reporter probes labeled with 6-carboxy ﬂuorescein (FAM), obtained from Applied Biosystems were used. Tomonitor gene expression, the following primers and probewere used: SmPK-F: 5 ’-TTGAAAATGAAAACGGACA ACAAATAGCT-3 ’, SmPK-R: 5 ’-GATAGAACAGTTTGGATT GTACTAAGAACTGA-3 ’,S m P Kp r o b e :5 ’-FAM-TTCCT TCAAAGATGCCTTCC-3 ’;S m P L P - P h - F :5 ’-GTTGCGA ATTGGACCCTTCAAAA-3 ’, SmPLP-Ph-R: 5 ’-CCAAAT TTATTCCCAAATGCGATATCAGT-3 ’, SmPLP-Ph-probe: 5 ’- FAM-CTGTGATGGTTGGAGATAACTTAT-3 ’; SmPNPO-F: 5’-GAAAATGAATATGCTTCAAAAGAAAAGCTTCC-3 ’, SmPNPO-R: 5 ’-CCAAAACTCAATTGA TTTCGGAGACA-3 ’, SmPNPO-probe: 5 ’FAM-TCCCCAATTTGAAGGCTTT-3 ’.Each RT-qPCR was performed using a TaqMan PCR mix,cDNA and primer and probes in a ﬁnal volume of 20 µl.All samples were run in triplicate and underwent 40 ampli ﬁcation cycles on a Step One Plus Real Time PCR System Instrument.For relative quanti ﬁcation, the DDCt method was employed.Statistical Analysis Data are presented as Mean ± SD.
Means were compared by: t-test (two-tailed, unpaired) for co mparison of two groups; one-way ANOVA for comparison of more than two groups using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software). For metabolite comparisons, Welch ’s two-sample t-test was used to identify biochemicals biomolecules thatdiffered signi ﬁcantly between groups.A probability value (P) of less than 0.05 was considered signi ﬁcant.RESULTS Schistosomes Cleave Exogenous Pyridoxal Phosphate (PLP) To examine changes brought about by schistosomes on host plasma, adult worms were ﬁrst incubated in murine plasma as described earlier.Twenty and 60 min later, samples were collected and changes to the plasma metabolome weremeasured.Figure 1 illustrates relative changes to pyridoxal (A) and phosphate (B) levels in murine plasma which contained (+)or did not contain (-) adult schistosomes.
Figure 1A shows that there is a signi ﬁcant increase in the level of pyridoxal at both the 20- and the 60-min time points in the plasma sample that contained worms as well as signi ﬁcant increases in the plasma phosphate level ( Figure 1B ) (P <0.05 in each case). One explanation for these results is that the worms cleave pyridoxalphosphate (PLP, a compound that was not itself monitored inthe plasma metabolome) to generate free pyridoxal and phosphate, a reaction that is illustrated in Figure 1C .Note that the fold increase in phosphate is markedly greater than that ofpyridoxal, suggesting that sources other than PLP account formuch of the accumulated phosphate.We next examined the ability of live worms to hydrolyze commercially obtained PLP.
Figure 2 shows that all intravascular life stages [schistosomula ( Figure 2A ), adult females ( Figure 2B ), and adult males ( Figure 2C )] can indeed cleave PLP to release phosphate (which accumulates over time).Schistosomula were tested in groups of ~2,000 and adult wormswere tested either singly or in groups of two or three (as AB C FIGURE 1 | Box plots showing relative levels of pyridoxal (A)and phosphate (B)in murine plasma that either contained adult schistosomes (+, red) or did not contain schistosomes (-, black) for the indicated time periods. * indicates statistically signi ﬁcant difference compared to the same time point lacking parasites; Welch ’s two-sample t-test, P < 0.05.Each box bounds the upper and lower quartile, the line in each box is the median value and “+”signi ﬁes the mean value for the sample; error bars indicate the maximum (upper) and minimum (lower) distribution.Values obtained at zero time (0) are set at 1.

Vitamin B6 Biochemistry in Schistosomes Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org February 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 622162 4 indicated).More worms (and longer time points) lead to greater phosphate accumulation.Recombinant SmAP can Hydrolyze PLP Next, we tested the ability of three S.mansoni ectoenzymes to cleave PLP.These enzymes are: alkaline phosphatase (SmAP),nucleotide phosphodiesterase/pyrophosphatase (SmNPP5), andATP diphosphohydrolase1 (SmATPDase1); all three have been generated as recombinants, in enzymatically active form in our laboratory ( 17,21,23).Figure 3 shows that only rSmAP can cleave PLP to liberate phosphate.Neither rSmNPP5 norrSmATPDase1 are active in this assay [though they can cleaveother substrates ( 17,30)].In addition, heat-inactivated rSmAP can no longer cleave PLP (data not shown).
Tegumental SmAP Cleaves PLP To test the hypothesis that tegumental SmAP on living worms isresponsible for PLP cleavage, adult worms were ﬁrst treated withsiRNAs targeting SmAP or with control siRNAs or with no siRNA. Two days later the relative expression level of the target SmAP gene was compared in all groups.Figure 4A shows signiﬁcant SmAP gene suppression in worms treated with siRNA targeting this gene compared to the controls; the SmAPgene is >90% suppressed as determined by RT-qPCR (p < 0.01).Seven days post siRNA treatment the ability of all worms to hydrolyze PLP was compared and Figure 4B shows the results of this experiment.It is clear that living worms whose SmAP genehas been suppressed cleave signi ﬁcantly less PLP compared to control worms treated either with the control siRNA or with nosiRNA (P < 0.001).Having less SmAP severely impairs the abilityof the living worms to hydrolyze exogenous PLP.In Silico Analysis of Vitamin B6 Metabolizing Enzymes of S.
mansoni Figure 5 depicts SmAP (lower left, red) at the schistosome surface dephosphorylating PLP to generate free pyridoxalwhich we hypothesize can then be taken into the worms viaan unidenti ﬁed transporter protein ( Figure 5 , blue oval). The large yellow rectangle in Figure 5 contains depictions of hypothesized vitamin B6 metabolic reacti ons within the parasites as determined by in silico analysis, described next.If free pyridoxal is taken in by schistosomes, it would need to be phosphorylated internally to regenerate PLP (the active formof vitamin B6).Phosphorylating pyridoxal is a function that isprovided in other organisms by pyridoxal kinase (PK) enzymes.Blasting the human PK protein sequence against schistosome sequence databases identi ﬁed a clear S.mansoni homolog.As detailed in Methods, the complete S.mansoni pyridoxal kinase (SmPK) coding sequence was ampli ﬁed by PCR.
The puri ﬁed PCR product was then cloned, and plasmid was isolated fromseveral clones that were sequenced. The full length schistosomeSmPK sequence (accession number MW148599) potentially encodes a 340 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 37,773 daltons and a pI of 5.99.Figure 6 shows an alignment of this SmPK protein with its counterpart from S.japonicum as well as homologs from a variety of other organisms.Residues conserved in all seven sequences are depicted as white FIGURE 3 | rSmAP can hydrolyze PLP.Phosphate generation (µM, mean +/-SD) by recombinant SmAP, SmNPP5, or SmATPDase1 in assay buffer containing PLP as substrate, at the indicated time points.No appreciable levels of phosphate were detected when rSmNPP5 or rSmATPDase1 were tested.AB C FIGURE 2 | Live schistosome parasites hydrolyze PLP.

Vitamin B6 Biochemistry in Schistosomes Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org February 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 622162 6 these, six were found to encode the protein shown in Figure 6A . The remaining ﬁve SmPK clones all encoded a variant sequence (isoform 1, accession number MW148600) in which thepredicted motif 36LGIEVDFINSVQFSNH51(indicated by a green line at the top of Figure 6A ) is replaced by the sequence: 36CVLLIITY43.This change is brought about by alternative splicing.The Figure 6C upper panel illustrates the 5 ’end of the SmPK gene and shows three of the gene ’s 10 exons.The lower panel illustrates two spliced mRNA transcripts.The SmPKtranscript is depicted at left; here the ﬁrst three exons encode part of the mature transcript.The alternatively spliced SmPKisoform 1 transcript is shown at right; here exon 2 is spliced out along with intron 1, while the 31 bp intron 2 remains as part of the mature isoform 1 transcript.
The reverse reaction to that catalyzed by pyridoxal kinase is commonly driven by PLP-phosphatase (PLP-Ph) enzymes. Todetermine if schistosomes possess enzymes belonging to thisprotein class, essentially the same strategy as used to identify SmPK (described above) was applied.Here, the human PLP- phosphatase sequence was used to query schistosome sequence databases.A homolog was identi ﬁed, and its cDNA was cloned and sequenced (accession number MW148602).The 292 predictedamino acid protein, designated SmPLP-Ph has a MW of 31,915and a pI of 6.70.Figure 7A shows an alignment of the predicted SmPLP-Ph protein with homologs from a variety of other organisms and a phylogenetic tree illustrating the relationships between these is depicted in Figure 7B .
Conserved motifs are seen throughout the protein with predicted key active siteresidues indicated by black arrowheads, metal (Mg) bindingresidues indicated by brown arrowheads and potentialmyristoylation sites indicated by blue lines ( 32,33). As noted earlier, pyridoxine and pyridoxamine are vitamin B6 vitamers.In the same way that pyridoxal is phosphorylated togenerate PLP, likewise pyridoxine and pyridoxamine can each bephosphorylated by pyridoxal k i n a s et og e n e r a t ep y r i d o x i n e phosphate and pyridoxamine ph osphate, respectively.An oxidase enzyme [pyridox(am)ine 5 ’-phosphate oxidase, PNPO] is then required to convert these compounds into PLP —the biologically active form of vitamin B6.In order to assess whether schistosomes possess a PNPO homolog (SmPLPO) we appliedthe same strategy that was used successfully to ﬁnd SmPK and SmPLP-Ph.Here, the human PNPO sequence was used to queryschistosome sequence databases and a homolog was identi ﬁed.
The cDNA encoding this match was ampli ﬁed, cloned and its insert sequenced (accession number MW148601). The predicted SmPNPO sequence is shown in Figure 8A aligned with several homologs and a phylogenetic tree illustrating the relationshipsbetween these is depicted in Figure 8B .The 246 amino acid SmPNPO protein has a predicted molecular mass of 28,878daltons and a pI of 6.55 and exhibits several highly conserveddomains including a series of residues important for PLP binding (orange arrowheads) as well as those used to bind co-factor ﬂavin mononucleotide (FMN, black arrowheads) ( 34).Phylogenetic trees chart the relationships between the three S.mansoni vitamin B6 metabolizing enzymes SmPK ( Figure 6B ), SmPLP-Ph ( Figure 7B ), and SmPNPO ( Figure 8B ) and theirclosest homologs from the same seven other organisms.
Overall, the SmPK tree, the SmPLP-Ph tree and the SmPNPO tree aresimilar —e.g., the proteins of the two schistosome species are most closely related while that from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is consistently most distant. However, even though the proteins likely have the same metabolic function involving vitamin B6 biochemistry in all of the organisms, the three trees are not identical.This likely re ﬂects the diverse selection pressures exerted on the proteins during the evolutionaryhistories of each of the different organisms.Not surprisingly, several genes encoding proteins that require PLP have been annotated in the S.mansoni genome including aspartate aminotransferase (Smp_064380), or nithine-oxo-acid transaminase (Smp_000660), 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase (Smp_045260), serine C-palmitoyltransfera se (Smp_028080), and glycogen phosphorylase (Smp_143840).Th is highlights the importance of PLP for widely diverse aspects of schistosome biochemistry.
Developmental Expression of SmPK, SmPLP-Ph, and SmPNPO T h er e l a t i v ee x p r e s s i o nl e v e l so f SmPK, SmPLP-Ph, and SmPNPO, assessed by RT-qPCR, are depicted in Figures 9A –C. In all cases the expression level in adult males is set at 100%.For each of the threegenes, lowest relative expression is seen in the cercarial life stage and robust expression is seen in all intravascular life stages (adults and schistosomula).SmPLP-Ph exhibits notably high relative expressionin schistosomula and expression of SmPNPO ( Figure 9C )d i f f e r s from that of SmPK and SmPLP-Ph by having high relativeexpression also in the egg stage.DISCUSSION When schistosomes are incubated in murine plasma they alter itsmetabolomic pro ﬁle; the levels of two of the metabolites measured (pyridoxal and phosphate) increase over time.
Thischange is most easily understood if the worms have an ability tocleave any pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) that is available in theplasma thereby generating free pyridoxal and phosphate. Sinceintact PLP was not included in the panel of metabolites monitored, we do not see here a commensurate drop in PLP levels that would be predicted to accompany the observedincrease in pyridoxal and phosphate.PLP is the active form ofvitamin B6 and plays critical roles in cellular biochemistry.Animals, including schistosomes, are auxotrophic for vitaminB6 and require it as a supplement.The intravascular worms must acquire this vital metabolite from their hosts.These factors inspired us to investigate how the worms might obtain andmetabolize vitamin B6.Weﬁrst show here that all intravascular schistosome life stages tested (schistosomula as well as adult males and females)can cleave exogenous PLP.
Since PLP hydrolysis was mediated bylive, intact worms this suggests that the enzyme responsible is expressed at the schistosome surface.

Among the characterized proteins are three ectoenzymes that are strong candidates for mediating the cleavage of PLP by the worms, as seen in this work.All three are nucleotide metabolizing ectoenzymes (NMEEs) andinclude an ATPdiphosphohydrolase1 (SmATPDase1), aphosphodiesterase/pyrophosphatase (SmNPP5) and an alkalinephosphatase, (SmAP) ( 17,21,23). Current known substrates for SmATPDase1 are ATP and ADP ( 17); for SmNPP-5, ADP, and NAD ( 21,30), and for SmAP: AMP, GMP, CMP, TMP, S1P, and polyP ( 23,24).Here we explored the ability of each of these three ectoenzymes, all produced in active recombinant form in CHOcells, to cleave PLP.Of the three, only SmAP was seen tohydrolyze PLP and this ability was lost upon enzyme heat-inactivation.Furthermore, parasites whose SmAP gene was suppressed by RNAi were signi ﬁcantly impaired in their ability to cleave PLP compared to controls.This proves that SmAPpresent at the surface of intravascular schistosomes can cleaveexogenous PLP.
The very substantial decrease (> 90%) in PLPcleavage observed in the SmA P-suppressed worms stronglysuggests that SmAP is the sole schistosome ectoenzyme with this capability. Much of the literature on schistosome ectoenzyme function focuses on the ability of the enzymes to maintain an anti-inﬂammatory and anti-thrombotic environment around the worms ( 38).ATP is a pro-in ﬂammatory, damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that may be cleaved by SmATPDase1 (17).This enzyme, as well as SmNPP5, can cleave the pro-coagulant, platelet-activator ADP ( 17,21).SmAP cleaves the pro-thrombotic, immune modulators S1P and polyP ( 23,24).SmAP additionally cleaves AMP to generate the potently anti-in ﬂammatory mediator, adenosine ( 22).
In addition to its proposed role in impairing host purinergic signaling [by cleaving AMP to generate the signalingmolecule adenosine ( 38)], SmAP may also have a role in parasite feeding; its action may generate metabolites in a form that permits their easy transportation into the body of the worm. SmAP-dephosphorylation of not just AMP but also of GMP, CMP, andTMP [to generate adenosine, guan osine, cytosine, and thymidine, respectively ( 23)] may facilitate the ef ﬁcient uptake of these A B FIGURE 7 | Alignment of SmPLP-Ph with other members of the pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase protein family.Sm, Schistosoma mansoni (GeneBank accession number MW148602); Sh, Schistosoma haematobium (CAX69944); Hs, Homo sapiens (NP_064711); Dm, Drosophila melanogaster (NP_649015.2); Ce, Caenorhabditis elegans (NP_504511); Bm, Brugia malayi (XP_001895356); Sc, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (AJV03114).Residue shading is as described in Figure 6 .

We argue that, in a comparable manner, SmAP-mediated cleavage of membrane-impermeable PLP will generate free pyridoxal in the vicinity of the parasites from where it can be easily imported into the body of the worms. In similar fashion, in vertebrates, the absorption of PLP ﬁrst involves dephosphorylation catalyzed by a membrane-boundalkaline phosphatase ( 11,40).Precisely how any pyridoxal that is generated following PLP cleavage is taken into any cell remains unclear; whether bypassive diffusion and/or by carrier-mediated absorption ( 11, 41).In either case, uptake is driven by the intracellular trapping of the vitamin viathe formation of 5 ′-phosphates through the action of a cytosolic ATP-dependent pyridoxalkinase ( 11).To explore the possibility that schistosomes possess such an enzyme that could likewise trap any imported A B FIGURE 8 | Alignment of SmPNPO with other members of the pyridox(am)ine 5 ’-phosphate oxidase protein family.

PLP within cells may be dephosphorylated to generate pyridoxal which can then be taken up by other cells within the body and in this manner vitamin B6 vitamers can become distributed between tissues ( 10,11). In schistosomes, SmAP could ful ﬁll this PLP- dephosphorylation function; th e enzyme is widely distributed in schistosomes ( 18,22)a n dw eh a v es h o w nh e r et h a ti tc a nc l e a v eP L P to generate free pyridoxal.However, since SmAP is a GPI-linkedectoenzyme, whether it is available to contribute to intracellular, cytosolic PLP metabolism is called i nto question.In other systems, a phosphatase more dedicated to this task —PLP-Ph cleaves PLP intracellularly and we show here th at schistosomes possess a clear PLP-Ph homolog (SmPLP-Ph) with s everal highly conserved motifs characteristic of this protein family.A third enzyme that is key to vitamin B6 metabolism is a pyridox (am)ine-5 ’-phosphate oxidase (PNPO).
This enzyme converts the vitamin B6 vitamers pyridoxine phosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate into the active form of the vitamin —pyridoxal phosphate. Again, examination of s chistosome sequence databases reveals a clear schistosome PNPO homolog (SmPNPO) whichcontains multiple conserved motifs throughout the predictedprotein that are characteristic of this protein family.Taken together our analysis sugg ests that if schistosomes take in any B6 vitamer (pyridoxine, pyri doxamine, or pyridoxal) from the blood, they possess the enzymes necessary to convert these into theactive form of the vitamin —PLP.The pathways involved are illustrated in Figure 5 , yellow rectangle.SmPK could convert pyridoxal directly to PLP.SmPK could phosphorylate bothpyridoxine (top right, Figure 5 ) and pyridoxamine (bottom right, Figure 5 ) to generate pyridoxine phosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate, respectively and these two metabolites could beconverted to PLP viaSmPNPO.
Finally, the phosphatase SmPLP- Ph, and/or SmAP, could dephosphorylate several vitamers to permiteasier movement of B6 metabolites between tissues. Developmental expression analysis of SmPK, SmPLP-Ph, and SmPNPO reveals high relative expression of all three in intravascular schistosome life stages, suggestive of robustvitamin B6 metabolism within the ﬁnal host.The expression patterns of the genes encoding each of these enzymes are distinct,likely re ﬂecting differences in the biochemical pathways that are most engaged in the various life stages.The work presented here extends the known substrates upon which SmAP can act; in addition to AMP, GMP, CMP, TMP, S1P, and polyP, PLP is now added to the l ist.We hypothesize that SmAP at the surface of intravascular schistosomes plays a key role invitamin B6 acquisition by the parasites.The protein can cleave PLPin the blood to generate a pool of free pyridoxal in the vicinity of theworms from where this vitamer might conveniently be taken up.
Phosphorylation of pyridoxal viaS m P Kw o u l dt r a pt h ev i t a m e r inside the worms as PLP which could then engage in the manybiochemical reactions that require this co-factor. It has been reported that plasma PLP gets mobilized to sites of inﬂammation for use by PLP ‐dependent enzymes that play active roles in in ﬂammatory processes e.g., the PLP ‐dependent reactions that are necessary for immune cell proliferation or togenerate immunomodulatory sphingolipids ( 42 ).Thus, it is possible that SmAP-mediated cleavage of plasma PLP not onlygenerates free pyridoxal as a nutrient for the worms butadditionally deprives the host of suf ﬁcient PLP for optimal inﬂammation.Furthermore, pyridoxal alone has been shown capable of inhibiting production of in ﬂammatory cytokines in macrophages ( 43).
Thus, it is possible that any pyridoxal generated by the action of SmAP that is not imported into theparasites could contribute to a biochemical anti-in ﬂammatory perimeter established by the worms around themselves. Blocking SmAP function in schistosomes might impair parasite feeding and metabolism by diminishing the available pool ofpyridoxal around the worms ( in addition to impeding the parasite ’s ability to generate the anti-in ﬂammatory mediators adenosine and pyridoxal).Thus, new therapies that inhibit SmAPmight block both parasite feed ing and immunomodulation and could help to promote optimal in ﬂammatory responses thereby controlling these globally debilitating pathogens.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.The name of the repository and accession numberscan be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/, MW148599, MW148600, MW148602, MW148601.
