Abstractsiii6 NEURO-ONCOLOGY ADVANCES • DECEMBER 2022approaches are required for local tumor control.Here, we show a positron emission tomography (PET) integrated local therapy (PETx), to target HGGs.This technique consists of a one-step local theranostic application, followed by PET monitoring, with a hypoxia-targeting radiopharmaceutical 64Cu-diacetyl-bis ( N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (64Cu-ATSM).We examined the safety and therapeutic potential of 64Cu-ATSM PETx for HGG patient- derived xenograft (PDX) tumors, which recapitulated the parent tumor phenotype of high expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α and BNIP3, biomarkers of tissue hypoxia.Biodistribution, dosimetry, and toxicity studies of 64Cu-ATSM local administration determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to be 3.7 MBq in mouse.PETx using the MTD dose of 64Cu-ATSM indicated high tumor penetration, distribution, and retention of 64Cu-ATSM in PDX tumors, as compared to sham-treated mice.
The 64Cu-ATSM PETx promoted DNA double-strand breaks, followed by apoptosis in tumors, and extensively prolonged overall survival with tolerable systemic toxicity. These findings indicate the potential of 64Cu-ATSM PETx to induce high uptake in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, and strong therapeutic effects in PDX models.These findings establish 64Cu-ATSM PETx as a potential novel theranostic approach to facilitate local control of WHO CNS grade 4 HGGs.TUMOR BIOLOGY/MODELS (TB) TB-1 ADDITIONAL GENETIC ALTERATIONS DIFFERENTIALLY ALTER THE TRANSCRIPTOMIC LANDSCAPE OF H3 K27M-MUTANT DIFFUSE MIDLINE GLIOMA Shunichiro Miki1,2,8, Tomoyuki Koga3, Kasey R.Skinner4, Robert F.Gruener6, Daisuke Kawauchi2, R.Stephanie Huang5, C.

Recent analyses revealed alter - ations in several genes, such as NF1 and PDGFRA , are observed in substan - tial subpopulations of H3 K27M-mutant DMG patients in addition to H3 mutation and recurrent TP53 mutations, indicating patient-to-patient tumor heterogeneity and the potential necessity of tailored target therapy for the treatment of this disease. Here, using our human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived glioma avatar platform, we designed DMG models by introducing TP53 R248Q with or without heterozygous H3 K27M mutation in combination with further genetic modifications of either NF1 knockout or PDGFRA D842V overexpression to recapitulate DMG subpopulations.Mice with TP53 R248Q ; H3F3AK27M (QM) tumors survived signifi - cantly longer than those harboring QM; NF1-/- (QMN) tumors and QM; PDGFRA D842Voe (QMP) tumors.
RNA-sequencing of those induced DMG (iDMG) neurospheres revealed altered patterns of upregulation of MAPK pathway genes both in QMN and QMP-iDMG neurospheres compared to their H3 wildtype counterparts with the same combinations of genetic al - terations, suggesting that those additional mutations modifies the oncogenic signaling associated with H3 K27M mutation. Further, differential expression analysis comparing QMN and QMP-iDMG neurospheres revealed 405 dif - ferentially expressed genes.Gene set enrichment analysis showed upregulation of transcriptional programs related to mesenchymal signature in QMN- iDMG neurospheres and proneural signature in QMP-iDMG neurosphere as expected.These data show that NF1 deletion and PDGFRA D842V overexpression significantly alter gene expression in H3 K27M-mutant iDMG tumors, potentially opening up a new therapeutic avenue in these devastating tumors with patient-to-patient heterogeneity.
Further work using these models will shed light on the development of tailored therapy based on detailed gen - etic information on each patient sample, such as combining targeted kinase inhibition with HDAC inhibitors that have shown promise in the clinic.

Treatment of glioma, the most frequent primary brain tumor, is based on surgical removal of the tumor, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.
However, since gliomas grow invasively, surgical removal of the entire tumor is considered difficult. In addition, the standard treatment, temozolomide, possesses the problem of resistance.Therefore, the risk of recurrence is high, and the development of noble therapeutic agents for Glioma is required.We have screened for compounds with anti-tumor activity against Glioma from our natural com - pound library and focused on ginger extract, Compound A.In this study, we investigated the effect of Compound A on Glioma cell lines.Methods and Results: To evaluate the antitumor activity of Compound A on Glioma in vitro , MTT assay was performed.Human glioma cell lines U87-MG and U251 cells were treated with Compound A.After 96 hours, cell viability was evaluated using CCK-8.The IC50 value of Compound A in U87-MG cells was calculated to be 16.3 μM.The IC50 of Compound A in U251 cells was 10.8 μM.
Next, to examine the effect of Compound A on normal cells, we performed the same MTT assay using primary cultured rat astrocytes. The MTT assay showed no decrease in cell viability in primary cultured rat astrocytes at 15 μM, whereas an antitumor effect was observed in a human glioma cell line.Discussion: In this study, Compound A showed antitumor activity against Glioma without affecting normal cells.In the future, we will examine the effects of Compound A in an immunocompromised mouse brain in which U87-MG-RFP cells are implanted, which may lead to the development of therapeutic agents against Glioma.
IMMUNOLOGY (IM) IM-1 THE IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE ROLE OF MAIT CELLS AND MR1 IN GBM THROUGH THE INDUCTION OF NEUTROPHILS AND MDSCS Taijun Hana , Masaki Terabe ; Basic Immunology Section, Neuro-Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating brain tumor, and its immunosuppressive microenvironment has been implicated in the poor prognosis. However, the mechanism of the induction of the microenvir - onment is not well understood.MHC class I-related protein (MR1) is an antigen-presenting molecule for Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells.Recently, MR1 transcriptomic level was reported to correlate with glioma’s poor survival, and the infiltration of MAIT cells in GBM was re - ported previously.However, the role of MAIT cells and MR1 in GBM is poorly understood.We aimed to understand the mechanism by which MR1 levels affect GBM patient survival and any potential involvement of MAIT cells.
Method: RNA-sequencing data from TCGA-GBM was subjected to multi-layered analysis. Multiple methods, including comprehensive gene expression analysis and direct alignment-search using FASTQ data, were used to assess the immunological impact of MAIT cells in GBM.Using data from Pan-cancer TCGA, the role of MAIT cells in other cancer types was assessed.Result: The survival of GBM patients was negatively correlated with the level of MR1 expression.8.3% of TCGA-GBM samples were iden - tified to have MAIT cell infiltration, and the expression of MR1 , the amount of MAIT cell infiltration, and the activity of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs)/myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were significantly correl - ated.Simultaneously, the TAN/MDSC activity was significantly correlated with the poor survival of GBM patients.In four more cancer types, similar relationships between MAIT/MR1 and TANs/MDSCs were observed.
Con- clusions: Our observations shed light on the possible immunosuppressive role of MAIT cells and MR1. It was shown that MR1 up-regulation causes MAIT cell activation, which in turn causes TAN/MDSC induction.The current study implied the existence of a novel MAIT/MR1-TAN/MDSC immunosuppressive pathway, whose activation is associated with a worse prognosis for GBM.It was also suggested that a similar pathway might exist in other cancer types.IM-3 IDENTIFICATION OF THERAPEUTIC TARGET ANTIGENS USING PATIENT DERIVED GLIOBLASTOMA AND THEIR APPLICATION TO CAR-T THERAPY Hideki Kuroda1, Noriyuki Kijima1, Tetsuro Tachi1, Rena Utsugi1, Ryuichi HIrayama1, Yoshiko Okita1, Maoki Kagawa1, Naoki Hosen2,
