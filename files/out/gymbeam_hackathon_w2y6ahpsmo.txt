Designing healthy diets for disease prevention requires careful consideration of substituting unhealthier protein foods withhealthier protein foods. Methods: This was a pooled analysis of six prospective cohort studies of 29 682 US par- ticipants.Data were collected in 1985–2016.Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 30-year ab-solute risk differences (ARDs) were calculated for the associations between simultaneous substitution of one or more animal protein foods with other animal or plant protein foods at various amounts, and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality.Results: Substituting eggs, processed meat, unprocessed red meat or poultry with nuts, whole grains, legumes or ﬁsh was associated with lower risks of incident CVD and all-cause mortality.
According to different substitution amounts (varying from one serving per week to one serving per day) and different numbers of protein foods being simulta- neously substituted (varying from one to four), estimates ranged between 1%: HR, 0.99[95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 0.98–1.00], and 54%: HR, 0.46 (0.35–0.60), lower risks on therelative scale and between 0.3%: ARD, -0.29% (-0.48% to -0.05%), and 14.0%: ARD, -13.96% (-17.29% to -9.96%) lower risks on the absolute scale. Conclusions: Nuts, whole grains, legumes and ﬁsh appeared to be healthier protein sources than eggs, processed meat, unprocessed red meat and poultry for preventing incident CVD and premature death.The magnitude of lower risk for incident CVD andall-cause mortality was driven by amount and number of animal protein foodssubstituted.VCThe Author(s) 2021; all rights reserved.

7Existing literature commonly addresses single foods or nutrients, but peopledo not eat a single food or nutrient in isolation. Preventive efforts require inclusion of multiple foods simultaneously, thereby substituting a variety of unhealthier foods withhealthier foods to develop healthy eating patterns.8 Traditional substitution analysis focuses on nutrients, but people consume foods that bear a cluster of nutrientsand phytochemicals that have synergistic effects.9 Substituting foods within an eating pattern reflects natural human behaviours and their composite influences on health.Studies have examined substitutions of differentprotein sources with mortality 10–14and coronary heart dis- ease (CHD),6,15,16but there are limitations.For example, some studies combined a highly heterogeneous group offoods or nutrients for substitution (e.g.total carbohy- drates, protein from all plant sources), but nutrient compo- sition and health effects differ by source.
10–12,14Also, the amount of protein foods under substitution in all studies involved approximately one serving per day or more, but <5% of study participants consumed this level for most protein foods.6,10–13,15,16Furthermore, although dietarymodification involving simultaneous substitution of two or more foods may be appropriate for disease prevention,17 previous studies substituted one single food for an- other.6,10–13,15,16Also, most of these studies were con- ducted in well-educated and ethnically homogeneouspopulations, limiting generalizability. 6,10–15 To address these limitations, this study used data pooled from six prospective cohort studies of US partici-pants with diverse socioeconomic status and multi-ethnic backgrounds.
The primary objective was to determine rela- tive risks and absolute risks, up to three decades of follow-up, for incident CVD and all-cause mortality associated with simultaneous substitution of one or more animal pro- tein foods with other animal or plant protein foods at vari-ous amounts. Methods Study population The study population was described in previously pub-lished studies using the same data source.4,5Briefly, six prospective cohort studies of US adults were included andindividual participant data were pooled and harmonized.These six cohort studies included the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, Coronary Artery RiskDevelopment in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) andMulti-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).The base- line visits for these studies ranged from 1985 to 2002.
Participants were excluded if they had CVD at baseline,Key Messages •Nuts, whole grains, legumes and ﬁsh appeared to be healthier sources of protein than eggs, processed meat, unpro- cessed red meat and poultry for preventing cardiovascular disease and premature death. •Substituting two or more healthier protein foods for unhealthier protein foods, even for a small amount such as one serving per week, was associated with appreciably lower risks of cardiovascular disease and premature death.•Considerably lower risks of cardiovascular disease and premature death were seen in smaller subsets of participantswho were consuming more animal protein foods (e.g.one serving per day or more) and thus had greater room forreducing intake.
•Effect sizes resulting from substituting different protein sources wisely were comparable to effect sizes associated with improving other lifestyle factors, in relation to risks of cardiovascular disease and premature death, such as alco- hol intake, exercise, smoking and body weight.224 International Journal of Epidemiology , 2021, Vol. 50, No.1 extreme energy intake ( <500 or >6000 kcal/day), or miss- ing data.4,5 Outcome ascertainment The two outcomes were incident CVD and all-cause mor- tality.Incident CVD included CHD, stroke, heart failureand CVD death.All events were adjudicated by each origi- nal cohort using criteria including International Classification of Diseases codes, diagnostic procedures andreview of medical records and/or autopsy data.The adjudi- cation methodology has been described in ARIC, 18 CARDIA,19CHS,20FHS,21FOS21and MESA22as well as in studies using these cohorts.23,24The last event was docu- mented on 31 August 2016.
Dietary intake Only baseline diet data were analysed. A validated diet his- tory or food frequency questionnaire was used to collectdiet data by each cohort.25–29Diet data from all cohorts were harmonized using a standardized protocol.The de- tailed harmonization methodology is described elsewhere.4 The five primary dietary exposures were whole eggs, proc- essed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry and fish.One serving of processed meat was equivalent to two slices of ba-con, two small links of sausage or one hot dog.One whole egg and 85.05 grams of other meats (i.e.3 oz) were defined as one serving in this study.Three other protein foods in-cluded for substitution analysis were nuts (including seedsand nut butter), legumes and whole grains.One serving for these foods was equivalent to 28.35 grams (i.e.1 oz) of nuts or seeds, one tablespoon of nut butter, half a cup oflegumes, one slice of whole grain bread or one cup of ready- to-eat whole grain cereal.
More detail about serving sizes can be found elsewhere. 4Other foods not analysed were in liquids (e.g.milk), commonly used as ingredients (e.g.but- ter, cheese), or had incomparable ranges of intake or satiety effects (e.g.refined grains, fruits, vegetables).30 Statistical analysis Servings per day or week is the recommended scale forfood-level substitution analysis, because it provides a rela- tively standardized unit for foods with varying weight, vol- ume or both.30Incident CVD was analysed using cause- specific hazard models to account for competing risks of non-CVD death.31All-cause mortality was analysed using proportional hazards models.Events were censored at lossto follow-up.A substitution model for analysing two foods can be illustrated as follows: Y ¼aF1þbF2þcovariates.F1 and F2 are two foods under substitution.If one unit ofF1 is substituted for one unit of F2, the modified model (i.e.substitution model) will be Y substitution ¼a(F1-1) þ b(F2þ1)þcovariates ¼Yþ(b-a).
Therefore, the contrast between two beta coefficients is exactly the effect for one- unit substitution. The standard error is computed based on variance-covariance matrix.This model is easily expandedto include more foods.30Substitution analysis compares specific foods at various consumption amounts in relation to a health outcome, and uses observational data to mimic the effect of a long-term dietary intervention that is prohib-itive or even impossible to conduct.All eight protein foods were added to models, because a key assumption of substitution analysis is that the totalamount of foods under substitution is known and con- strained to a certain level, to ensure that effects from differ- ent pairs of substitution foods are interpretable.
30Models were stratified by cohort and adjusted for age, sex, race/ ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Chinese and other), education (less than highschool, high school and some college or more), smokingstatus (and pack-years) [never, former, current (0.1–4.9, 5.0–9.9, 10–19.9, 20–29.9, 30–39.9, or /C2140 pack years)], cohort-specific physical activity zscore, use of hormone therapy, total caloric intake, alcohol intake and a modified alternative healthy eating index 2010 score by removing protein-containing components. These covariates werechosen to remove confounding based on the literature evi- dence and potential mediators [e.g.blood glucose, serum cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index (BMI)]were not included.
4,5A quadratic term for processed meat was added because of the non-monotonic association with incident CVD, previously reported in this dataset.5 Proportional hazards assumption was evaluated using the supremum test using SAS ASSESS procedure with RESAMPLE option.32Stratifying by demographic varia- bles was performed if the assumption was violated. Substitution analysis for interchanging one protein food was conducted.It is possible that people may aim to modify intake of two or more foods at a time for diseaseprevention.Therefore, substitution analysis for simulta- neously interchanging two or more protein foods was also conducted.
Several examples selected based on the avail-able scientific evidence and individual-food substitutionresults of this study were presented to evaluate the hypoth- esis that substituting two or more unfavourable foods with favourable foods was associated with lower risks of CVDand all-cause mortality compared with substituting one unfavourable food with one favourable food. Estimates based on different substitution amounts varying from oneserving per week to one serving per day were computed.Both hazard ratios (HRs) and 30-year absolute risk differ- ences (ARDs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs)International Journal of Epidemiology , 2021, Vol.50, No.1 225 were calculated; 30-year ARDs were derived using three R packages: riskRegression,33pec34and survival.35Based on 500 bootstrap samples, 95% CIs were calculated.Analyseswere performed using R version 3.6.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing) and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Previous analyses in this dataset did not find consistent interactions by major demographic and lifestyle factors (e.g. age, sex, race/ethnicity and smoking status) for the associations between five animal protein foods and inci-dent CVD and all-cause mortality.4,5Thus, subgroup anal- yses were not performed.Also, previous imputation analyses suggested missing data did not qualitatively alterresults.4,5 Results Of the 29 682 participants included, mean age [standard deviation (SD)] was 53.7 (15.7) years at baseline; 16 514 (55.6%) were women; and 9101 (30.7%) were non-White.During a total of 562 624 person-years of follow-up, 6963 incident CVD cases and 8875 deaths were documented.The median [interquartile range (IQR)] of follow-up was19.0 (14.1–23.7) years.The maximum follow-up was31.3 years.
Compared with participants who consumed a lower total amount of five animal protein foods (eggs, processed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry and fish),those who consumed a higher amount were younger, were more likely to be male, non-Hispanic Black and current smokers, were less likely to use hormone therapy, hadhigher energy intake and lower diet quality ( Table 1 ). Basic demographic and dietary characteristics of the six cohorts were described in Supplementary Table S1 , available as Supplementary data atIJEonline.Substitution analysis via interchanging one food Substituting eggs with fish, nuts, legumes or whole grains was associated with 2–3% lower relative risks and0.4–0.7% lower absolute risks for incident CVD when the substitution amount was one serving per week, and 15–21% lower relative risks and 3.0–4.8% lower absoluterisks when the substitution amount was one serving perday ( Tables 2 and3).
Substituting eggs with unprocessed red meat, poultry, fish, nuts or whole grains was associated with 2–3% lower relative risks and 0.5–1.0% lower abso-lute risks for all-cause mortality when the substitution amount was one serving per week, and 11–22% lower rel- ative risks and 3.5–6.8% lower absolute risks when thesubstitution amount was one serving per day. Substituting processed meat with fish, nuts, legumes or whole grains was associated with 4–5% lower relativerisks and 0.9–1.2% lower absolute risks for incident CVD when the substitution amount was one serving per week, and 28–34% lower relative risks and 7.5–9.0% lower ab-solute risks when the substitution amount was one serving per day.
Substituting processed meat with poultry, fish, nuts or whole grains was associated with 2% lower relativerisks and 0.5–0.7% lower absolute risks for all-cause mor-tality when the substitution amount was one serving per week, and 10–15% lower relative risks and 3.1–4.6% lower absolute risks when the substitution amount wasone serving per day. Substituting unprocessed red meat with nuts or whole grains was associated with 1–2% lower relative risks and0.3–0.4% lower absolute risks for incident CVD when the substitution amount was one serving per week, and 9–13% lower relative risks and 2.0–2.8% lower absoluterisks when the substitution amount was one serving per day.
Substituting unprocessed red meat with fish or nuts was associated with 1–2% lower relative risks and0.4–0.5% lower absolute risks for all-cause mortalitywhen the substitution amount was one serving per week, and 10–11% lower relative risks and 2.9–3.5% lower ab- solute risks when the substitution amount was one servingper day. Substituting poultry with nuts or whole grains was asso- ciated with 1–2% lower relative risks and 0.5–0.6% lowerabsolute risks for incident CVD when the substitution amount was one serving per week, and 10–14% lower rel- ative risks and 3.1–3.8% lower absolute risks when thesubstitution amount was one serving per day.Substitutingpoultry with other protein foods was not associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality.Substituting fish with other protein foods was not asso- ciated with lower risks of incident CVD and all-cause mortality.
Substitution analysis via simultaneously interchanging two or more foods The effect sizes from substituting two or more foods with the same number of other foods ( Table 4 ) were consider- ably greater than those from single-food substitutionanalysis ( Tables 2 and3). For example, substituting eggs, processed meat and unprocessed red meat with nuts, legumes and whole grains was associated with 5–8% lower relative risks and 1.4–2.0% lower absolute risks for inci-dent CVD and all-cause mortality when the substitution amount was one serving per week, 15–28% lower relative risks and 4.7–7.0% lower absolute risks when the substitu-tion amount was 3–4 servings per week, and 28–50% lower relative risks and 8.9–13.3% lower absolute risks when the substitution amount was one serving per day.226 International Journal of Epidemiology , 2021, Vol.50, No.
1 However, only 39.0%, 6.1% and 1.4% of study partici- pants consumed at least one serving per week, 3–4 servings per week and one serving per day of eggs, processed meat and unprocessed meat, respectively. Discussion Based on this substitution analysis among nearly 30 000US adults pooled from six prospective cohort studies,substituting these four protein foods (fish, nuts, legumes, or whole grains) for four other protein foods (eggs, proc- essed meat, unprocessed red meat, or poultry) was associ- ated with lower risks of incident CVD and all-causemortality.According to different substitution amounts and number of protein foods being simultaneously substituted, effect sizes ranged between 1% and 54% lower risks onthe relative scale and between 0.3% and 14.0% lower riskson the absolute scale.

aThere were 6963 incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and 8875 all-cause deaths in the total study sample ( n¼29 682). Incident CVD included fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal heart failure and other CVD deaths.Cause-speciﬁc hazard models for incident CVD and standard proportional hazards mode ls for all-cause mortality were applied.
The models included cohort, eggs, processed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, ﬁsh, nuts, legumes, whole grains, age, sex, race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispa nic Black, Hispanic, Chinese and other), education ( <high school, high school and some college or more), total energy, smoking status (current, former, never), smoking pack-years (0, 0.1–4.9, 5.0–9.9, 10–19.9, 20–29.9 , 30–39.9, /C2140), cohort-speciﬁc physical activity zscore, alcohol intake (grams), hormone therapy (yes/no) and modiﬁed Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (excluding alcohol, meats, nuts, legumes and whole grains). Th e association between processed meat intake and incident CVD was non-monotonic as previously published,5and thus a quadratic term for processed meat intake was added in addition to the original linear term.Absolute risk differences were estimated using R packages: ‘riskRegression’, ‘pec’ and ‘survival’.
The time frame for estimating absolute risk differences was 30 years; 95% conﬁdence intervals were derived based on 500 bootstr ap samples. bAllP-values were <0.01.cProportion of study participants who consumed animal protein foods greater than or equal to the substitution amount for each analysis.230 International Journal of Epidemiology , 2021, Vol.50, No.1 in smaller subsets of participants who consumed more ani- mal protein foods and thus had greater room for reducing intake; /C246–24% of participants consumed at least one serving per day of any one of these four protein foods (eggs, processed meat, unprocessed red meat, or poultry) and only 0.2% consumed at least one serving per dayfor all.This study included a large racially, ethnically, socio- economically and geographically diverse sample of US adults, with follow-up spanning over three decades.Mostprevious studies were conducted among well-educated Caucasian or Japanese populations.
6,10–15Data of this study were harmonized using standardized protocols,4,23 which largely reduced heterogeneities in data collection across cohorts. Both relative and absolute risks were esti- mated, allowing a complete assessment of substitutioneffects and their health implications.36Also, different sub- stitution amounts and different numbers of foods for sub- stitution were considered.This approach was novel bytaking into account people with different levels of motiva-tion, dietary modification goals and current dietary intakes.Previous studies generally used one serving per day or more, which is likely an unrealistic substitution amountfor most people.6,10–13,15,16In addition in this study, non- linearity of the associations between protein foods and in- cident CVD and all-cause mortality was evaluated, whichis generally ignored in the substitution analysis literature.Limitations need to be discussed.
First, some misclassifi- cation bias was likely owing to misreporting of dietary in-take and using baseline diet data in this long follow-upstudy. However, previous studies in this dataset demon- strated robust results even if maximum follow-up was shortened to 10 or 20 years via statistical truncation.4,5 Second, confounding may be amplified in substitution analysis, because confounding underlying an association between a single dietary factor and an outcome may differfrom confounding underlying an association between mul- tiple dietary factors and an outcome.30Third, causal rela- tionships cannot be inferred from this observational study.Fourth, food preparation methods were not considered, which could considerably modify health effects of some foods.Fifth, generalizing results to other countries requirescaution, due to different background diets, nutrition statusand health status.
To our knowledge, no substitution analysis between protein sources and total CVD has been published, and thethree available studies focused only on a CVD subtype, CHD. 6,15,16Three other studies investigated all-cause mor- tality.10,11,13Overall, disparate study designs and analyti- cal strategies preclude meaningful comparisons between those studies and ours.For example, some studies analysed total red meat without differentiating unprocessed redmeat and processed meat.6,15Some studies used total plant protein for substitution without differentiating sour- ces,10,11although studies have shown different substitution effects when different plant protein foods were substituted for red meat.13,15Some studies did not consider plant pro- tein foods at all or ignored important ones.6,15,16In addi- tion, there are substantial differences in covariateadjustment and background diets across studies.
Nonetheless, a general pattern is that substituting eggs, processed meat or unprocessed red meat with plant proteinfoods was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortal- ity. 10,11,13Results from substituting fish or poultry with other protein sources are less consistent, which may be at-tributable to conflicting associations between fish or poul- try intake and CVD and all-cause mortality, partly owing to the difficulty of accounting for food preparation meth-ods and distinguishing fatty fish from non-fatty fish.4,5,7 Nonetheless, fish and poultry (non-fried and skin/fat re- moved) appear to be healthier than processed meat, unpro-cessed red meat and even eggs in some studies, forpreventing premature death and CHD.6,10–15 This substitution analysis was not based on identical protein amounts between different substitution foods, butbased on protein-containing foods as a whole, because people consume foods rather than pure nutrients.
The iden- tified associations were thus attributed to the differencesbetween protein-containing foods under substitution, in- stead of any single nutrient within them. Growing evidence supports choosing more plant sources and selected animalsources of protein as part of a cardio-protective dietarypattern, with less specificity regarding sources and amounts.3,17,37This study is the first substitution analysis of all major non-dairy protein sources in relation to totalCVD and all-cause mortality, with resulting population- level nutrition messages that may help guide daily dietary choices.Sources of protein matter.Based on this study,nuts and whole grains appeared to be the healthiest, and eggs and processed meat the unhealthiest, sources of pro- tein.Fish was found to be the single not unhealthy sourceof animal protein.
Substituting two or more protein foods for other protein foods, even for a small amount such as one serving per week, was associated with appreciablylower risks of CVD and premature death. All previousstudies focused on single-food or -nutrient substitution, which is important for risk assessment related to one fac- tor.However, simultaneously focusing on two or morefoods is consistent with human dietary behaviours and es- sential to assess population health under alternative dietary exposure distribution scenarios.38Of note, an inverse asso- ciation revealed from a substitution analysis does not nec- essarily guarantee a healthy dietary choice.For example, substituting eggs with unprocessed red meat was associatedInternational Journal of Epidemiology , 2021, Vol.50, No.
1 231 with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, but this is not rec- ommended because unprocessed red meat intake has been associated with incident CVD and mortality.5For a small group of people who consumed one serving or more ani- mal protein foods per day, substituting one or more fav- oured protein foods for not-favoured protein foods wasassociated with substantially lower risks of CVD and pre-mature death. Effect sizes resulting from choosing different protein sources wisely are comparable to effect sizes associ- ated with other lifestyle factors in relation to risks of CVDand premature death, such as alcohol intake (e.g.moderate drinkers vs non-drinkers), physical activity (e.g.study- specific lower vs higher level), cigarette smoking (e.g.1 vs0 cigarette/day) and BMI (e.g.class I obesity/overweight vs normal weight), based on observational data.
39–41 In conclusion, choice of dietary protein sources is an im- portant step towards preventing incident CVD and prema- ture death from all causes among US adults. Nuts, whole grains, legumes and fish appeared to be healthier sourcesof protein than eggs, processed meat, unprocessed redmeat and poultry.Substituting a greater amount (e.g.>1 serving/week) and number (e.g./C212) of protein foods from the former group for those from the latter group was asso-ciated with considerably lower risks of incident CVD and all-cause mortality.Supplementary data Supplementary data are available at IJEonline.Funding This work was partially supported by the American Heart Association Strategically Focused Research Networks to conduct thecurrent work (14SFRN20480260; principal investigator,Greenland).The Lifetime Risk Pooling Project was supported by theNational Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and BloodInstitute (R21 HL085375) and by the Northwestern UniversityFeinberg School of Medicine.
