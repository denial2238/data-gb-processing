Participants supplemented for four weeks included a loading phase for the creatinefor week 1 of 0.3 g/kg of body weight and a maintenance phase for weeks 2 –4 of 0.1 g/kg of body weight, with or without a continuous dose of β-ALA of 0.1 g/kg of body weight with doses rounded to the nearest 800 mg capsule providing an average of 6.1 ± 0.7 g/day of β-ALA. Participants reported for te sting at baseline, day 7 and day 28.Testing sessions consisted of obtaining a resting muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis, body composition measurements, performing a graded exercise test on the cycle ergometer for VO 2peak with lactate threshold determination, and multiple Wingate anaerobic capacity tests.Results: Although mean changes were consistent with prio r studies and large effect sizes were noted, no significant differences were observed among groups in changes in muscle carnosine levels (BA 35.3 ± 45; BAC 42.5 ± 99; CRE 0.72 ± 27; PLA 13.9 ± 44%, p = 0.59).
Similarly, although changes in muscle phosphagen levels after oneweek of supplementation were consistent with prior reports and large effect sizes were seen, no statistically significant effects were observed among groups in changes in muscle phosphagen levels and the impact of CRE supplementation appeared to diminish during the maintenance phase. Additi onally, significant time × g roup × Wingate interactions were observed among groups for repeated sprint peak power normalized to bodyweight (p = 0.02) and rate of fatigue (p = 0.04).Conclusions: Results of the present study did not reveal any consistent additive benefits of BA and CRE supplementation in recreationally active women.

Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2014, 11:55 http://www.jissn.com/content/11/1/55 Background Prior research has shown that beta-alanine ( β-ALA) supplementation (e.g., 3.2 g/day to 6.4 g/day for 2 to10-weeks) increases in muscle carnosine levels, with greater increases observed when larger total dosages have been consumed over time [1-8]. It has been suggestedthat an increase in intramuscular carnosine levels may lead to an enhanced muscle buffering capacity therefore improving performance by limiting the accumulation ofhydrogen ions (H +) [2,4,6,7,9,10].The amount of carno- sine elevation ranges from around 10% after two weeks [8] to around 80% after ten weeks [10].A recent review onthe ergogenic benefits of β-ALA supplementation sug- gested bouts of exercise lasting 1 –3 minutes seemed to provide the most benefit with mixed results seen duringshorter bouts of exercise [11].
There is also some evidence suggesting that β-ALA supplementation may positively affect body composition when combined with training[12], time to exhaustion [5,11], anaerobic exercise markers such as ventilatory threshold (VT) [13], as well as blood lactate levels [14,15]. The effects of creatine monohydratehave been extensively researched over recent years with respects to the effects on anaerobic exercise performance [16].High intensity exercise bouts require a faster rateof ATP resynthesis, which is most quickly attained by breaking down phosphocreatine (PCr) [17,18].Creatine monohydrate supplementation (e.g., 20 g/day for 5 to7-days and 3 –5 g/day thereafter) has been shown to increase the muscle creatine and PCr stores to assist in ATP resynthesis during high intensity exercise [19-21].
Given the reported ergogenic value of β-ALA and creat- ine supplementation, recent studies have begun to examine the combined effects of β-ALA and creatine monohydrate supplementation on anaerob ic exercise performance and muscle carnosine and creatine levels. Results have shown improvements in exercise performance variables such aspeak oxygen uptake (VO 2peak), lactate threshold (LT), and time to exhaustion with a combined supplementation strategy [15].Similarly, Hoffman and colleagues [22]reported that 10-weeks of β-ALA and creatine monohy- drate supplementation duri ng resistance-training had both independent and potentially synergistic ergogenic benefits in male strength/power athletes.However, more research is needed to determine whether there may beadditive benefit of co-supplementation of β-ALA and creatine monohydrate supplementation during training.Additionally, the majority of beta-alanine and creatinesupplementation studies have used males as participants.
Therefore, while it is generally understood how beta- alanine supplementation can affect muscle carnosinelevels as well as exercise performance in men, less is known how females will respond to beta-alanine supple- mentation during training [9,13,14,22-24]. Studies thathave examined the effects of β-ALA supplementation inwomen have reported mixed results [25,26].Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the short-term (7-days) and chronic effects (28-days) of β-ALA supple- mentation with and without creatine monohydrate on body composition, aerobic and anaerobic exercise per- formance, and muscle carnosine and muscle creatinelevels in college-aged, recreationally-active females.We theorized that co-supplementation of β-ALA and creatine monohydrate may lead to greater ergogenic and perform-ance adaptations by synergistically enhancing anaerobic and/or aerobic capacity.
Methods Experimental design The present study was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that recruited apparently healthy, moderately active females between the ages of 18 and 35 years to participate in th e study. Moderately active was defined as having a consistent recent history of participating in exercise (e.g., running, cycling, swimming, resistance training, fitness classes, etc.) for at least30 minutes per day for 3-days per-week for at least 3 months.Participants were not allowed to participate if they had taken ergogenic levels of nutritional supple-ments that may have affected muscle mass or anaerobic exercise capacity (i.e.creatine, β-ALA, ergogenic levels of nutritional caffeine, etc.) for at least three monthsprior to the start of the study.Those who met entrance criteria attended a familiarization session during which time they were familiarized to the study protocol withverbal and written explanations of the study requirements.
Participants still interested and meeting the entrance criteria signed informed consent statements in compliancewith the Human Participants Guidelines of Texas A&M University and the American College of Sports Medicine. During the familiarization session, participants were alsoweighed using a standing scale and asked to perform a practice Wingate exercise test on the cycle ergometer at 75% maximal effort.Participants were instructed to find acomfortable seat height and handle bar position which was recorded for subsequent testing sessions.Following the practice Wingate test they were given guidelines tofollow for maintaining and recording physical activity dur- ing their involvement in the study and scheduled for all subsequent testing sessions and randomly assigned to oneof four supplementation groups.Figure 1 shows a consort diagram of those found eligible, initiated, and completed the study protocol.
Individuals who did not complete thestudy did so for reasons unrelated to the study protocol. Resting and exercise testing Resting and exercise testing was performed at baseline prior to any supplementation, at one week of supple- mentation, and after four weeks at the completion of theKresta et al.Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2014, 11:55 Page 2 of 15 http://www.jissn.com/content/11/1/55 study.Figure 2 outlines the events of the testing sessions.Participants were asked to abstain from exercise for 24 hours and fast for at least eight hours prior to baselinetesting.One day prior to exercise testing, participants received a percutaneous muscle biopsy from the vastus lateralis muscle of the right leg using standard proceduresfor the Bergstrom method [27].Muscle samples were immediately frozen at −80° until analyzed.
The morning after the biopsy, participants were asked to fast for at least eight hours before being asked to consume a standard meal replacement drink ( Boost ® Original, Nestlé S.A., Vevey, Switzerland )f o u rh o u r sb e f o r e reporting to the lab in order to standardize nutritional intake prior to exercise testing. Once reporting to the lab, they were weighed using a free standing scale ( Cardinal Detecto Scale Model 8430, Webb City, Missouri )a n d had body composition determined using a Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometer (DEXA) [ Discovery QDR Series, Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA ].Quality control calibration procedures were performed on a spine phantom ( Holo- gic-X-CLAIBER Model DPA/QDR-1 anthropometric spinephantom ) and a density step calibration phantom prior to each testing session.
Mean test-retest reliability studies performed on athletes in the lab had yielded mean coeffi-cients of variation for total bone mineral content and total fat free/soft tissue mass of 0.31% to 0.45% with a mean intra-class correlation of 0.985 [28]. They then had theirtotal body water (TBW) measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis ( ImpediMed DF50, San Diego, CA ).Following the resting measures, participants began exer-cise testing starting with a maximal graded exercise test (GXT) using an incremental protocol on the Lode Excali- ber Sport 925900 cycle ergometer ( Lode BV, Groningen, The Netherlands ) with metabolic measurements recorded on the ParvoMedics True One 2400 Metabolic System (ParvoMedics, Sandy, Utah ).The protocol began at 50 W maintaining 70 rpm and the intensity was increased by 25 W every three minutes until a pedaling rate of 70 rpm was no longer maintained.Previous research has indicated Figure 1 Consort diagram of study enrollment.

Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2014, 11:55 Page 3 of 15 http://www.jissn.com/content/11/1/55 a mean intra-class correlation of 0.994 and a mean intra-class coefficient of variation of 4.7% when using the ParvoMedics True One 2400 Metabolic system [29].Calibration procedures were completed prior to each testing session.Blood samples were taken from the fingertips in the final minute of each stage of exercise and five minutes into the recovery to determine LT.Lactate was determined using a Lactate Scout ( Sports Resource Group, USA ) handheld analysis device.Previous research has yielded a mean intra-class correlation of 0.91 and a mean intra- class coefficient of variation of 10.2% [30].Calibrationprocedures were completed prior to each testing session.
The LT was calculated two different ways including the point at which blood lactate concentrations rises morethan 1.0 mM/l from the previously recorded value LT and the point at which blood lactate level was greater than or equal to 4.0 (also termed the onset of blood lactate,OBLA). All values were reported as a percent of VO 2peak.The ventilatory threshold (VT) was determined as the point during the GXT where pulmonary ventilationincreased at a disproportional rate with VO 2,a n dw a s also recorded as a percent of VO 2peak.Following the GXT, participants rested passively for 30 minutes andthen performed two 30-sec Wingate Anaerobic Capacity Tests at a standardized work rate of 7.5 J/kg/rev.The seat position was standardized between trials and theparticipant was asked to pedal as fast as possible prior to application of the workload and sprint at all-out maximal capacity during the 30-second test with 3 minutes ofpassive rest in between.
Blood was taken from the finger- tips before the start of Wingate 1, immediately following Wingate 2, and after 5 minutes of passive recovery follow-ing the completion of both Wingate tests. Test-to-test variability in performing repeated Wingate anaerobic capacity tests in our laboratory yielded a coefficient ofvariation (CV) of ±15% with a test retest correlation of r= 0.98 for mean power [31].Participants practiced the anaerobic capacity test during the familiarization sessionto minimize learning effects.Supplementation protocol The supplementation protocol was modified from those used by Hoffman et al.in 2006 [22] and Zoeller et al.in 2007 [15].The creatine monohydrate ( Creapure ®,A l z C h e m Trostberg GmbH, Germany ) supplementation was provided in the form of a powder that the participants were instructed to mix with water (6 –10 oz.).
The β-ALA used in this study ( CarnoSyn ®, Natural Alternatives International, Inc., San Marcos, CA )w a sas u s t a i n e d release form of β-ALA that was provide in 800 mg capsules. In a double blinded manner, participants were matched to body mass and randomly assigned to either ingest β-ALA (BA, n = 8), creatine monohydrate (CRE,n = 8), a combination of β-ALA and creatine monohydrate (BAC, n = 9), or a placebo (PLA, n = 7).The β-ALA only group received a dose of 0.1 g/kg body weight per day forthe entire 28 days with 0.3 g/kg/day of dextrose for week 1 and 0.1 g/kg/day of dextrose for weeks 2 –4.The creatine only group was given a dose of 0.3 g/kg/day of creatine forweek 1 and 0.1 g/kg/day for weeks 2 –4, with 0.1 g/kg/day maltodextrin for the 28 days.
The β-ALA and creatine combined group consumed a 0.1 g/kg/day of β-ALA for the entire 28 days (about 6.1 ± 0.7 g/day) with 0.3 g/kg/ day of creatine for week 1 (about 18 ± 1.8 g/day) and 0.1 g/kg/day of creatine for weeks 2 –4 (about 6.1 ± 0.7 g/ day). Finally, the placebo group was given 0.1 g/kg/day of maltodextrin capsules for all 28 days with 0.3 g/kg/day of dextrose powder for week 1 and 0.1 g/kg/day for weeks2–4 which served as the placebo for creatine monohy- drate.The β-ALA and matched placebo doses were rounded to the nearest 800 mg capsule while the creatinemonohydrate and matched placebo doses were rounded to the nearest 0.1 g.The rationale in providing more of ar e l a t i v ed o s a g eo f β-ALA was an attempt to help normalize the administration β-ALA to body mass to doses that are commercially available.
Participants were instructed to take divided doses of the supplements at 4intervals throughout the day with water and/or food, as close to 8:00 am, 12:00 pm, 4:00 pm and 8:00 pm as possible. Participants were given supplements one weeka tat i m ea n dw e r ea s k e dt or e t u r nt h ee m p t yc o n t a i n e r st o ensure compliance.They also completed supplementation logs each week to monitor compliance of supplementation.Muscle analysis The muscle samples were obtained using a modifiedBergstrom muscle biopsy technique and were analyzed for phosphocreatine (PCr) and creatine (Cr) content based on methods from previous studies [32-34].Percutaneousmuscle biopsies (50 –70 mg) were obtained from the mid- dle portion of the vastus lateralis muscle of the thigh at the midpoint between the patella and greater trochanterof the femur.The biopsy needle was inserted 1 –2 cm into the muscle prior to tissue extraction.
Once the biopsy was taken, adipose tissue was trimmed from the muscle speci-mens and then the muscle sample was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for later analysis. A total of three muscle samples were obtained, two fromone leg and one from the opposite leg (Day 0, 6, & 27).The left leg was used for pre and post biopsies with the right leg being used for the mid biopsy.Muscle tissue samples were analyzed spectrophotomet- rically in duplicate to determine PCr and Cr content using methods developed by Harris and colleagues [20,21,32].Briefly, approximately 50 –70 mg of muscle tissue was cut and placed in a microfuge tube, and then placed in a vacuum centrifuge ( Savant ISS110 SpeedVac Concentrator,Kresta et al.Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2014, 11:55 Page 4 of 15 http://www.jissn.com/content/11/1/55 Thermo Scientific, Milford, MA ) and centrifuged for 18–24 hours.
Connective tissue was removed from the dried samples which were then ground into a powder in aporcelain plate and placed into pre-weighed microfuge tubes. Muscle metabolites were extracted in a 0.5 M per- chloric acid/1 mM EDTA solution on ice for 15 minutes,while periodically vortexing.Samples were then centri- fuged at 7,000 rpm for 5 minutes.The supernatant was transferred into a pre-weighed microfuge tube and neu-tralized with 2.1 M KHCO 3/0.3 M MOPS solution.The samples were then centrifuged again at 7,000 rpm for 5 mi- nutes and the supernatant was removed and placed intomicrofuge tubes and frozen at −80°C.Extracts were assayed for PCr in the presence of 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4; 1 mM magnesium chloride,0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM glucose, 50 μMN A D P +, 350 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.The assay was carried out in 13 × 75 glass screw-top tubes using10μL of sample to 1 mL of reagent.
The reactant solution was vortexed and read using a fluorometer ( Shimadzu RFMini 150, Japan ) with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Twenty five mL of hexokinase solution was added to 1 mL of reagent and stabilized.For PCr, 20 μL of creatine kinase/ sulfodicholorphenol (CK/SDP) solution was added to the tubes, which were vortexed and incubated in a dark at room temperature for 60 minutes when samples wereread again for post-reaction absorbance values.Extracts were assayed for Cr in the presence of 50 mM imidazole buffer, pH 7.4; 5 mM magnesium chloride;20 mM potassium chloride; 25 μM phosphoenolpyruvate; 200μM ATP; 45 μM NADH; 1250 U/mL lactate dehydro- genase; 2000 U/mL pyruvate kinase.The assay was carriedout in a standard fluorescence microplate reader using 10μL of sample to 1 mL of reagent.
The reactant solution was vortexed and read using a fluorometer ( Shimadzu RFMini 150, Japan ) with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm for base- line absorbance values. Five μLo fC K( 2 5 μ/mg) was added to 1 mL of the above buffer and stabilized using 1 mL of reagent.After 10 minutes the plate was read again for post-reaction absorbance values.Test to test reli- ability of duplicate muscle creatine assays was 0.22 ± 2.4% (r = 0.90) with a coefficient of variation of 6.8%.Creatineand PCr were analyzed using a SpectraMax 250 ( Molecu- lar Devices, Sunnyvale, CA ).All results were expressed as mmol/kg dry weight (DW).Total muscle creatine contentwas calculated by adding the resulting amounts of PCr and Cr content together.Muscle carnosine was analyzed using the HPLC proce- dures developed by Dunnett and Harris [35].The muscle samples were prepared using the same drying methods as before.
Muscle samples were analyzed using an Aquity-UPLC system ( Waters, Milford, MA ). Chromatographywas performed using a Thermo Scientific Hypersil ODS (150 mm × 4.6 mm ID) analytical column protected by a Hypersil ODS guard column.Solvents were filtered to0.45μm.Compounds were eluted using a solvent gradient at ambient temperature with the following mobile phases: LINE A: Solvent A:20 mM phosphate buffer [(20 mMNa 2HPO 4(2.84 g/l) + 20 mM NaH 2PO4.2H 2O( 3 .1 2g / l ) ] , pH 6.8 –tetrahydrofuran (995:5 v/v); LINE B: Solvent B: 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 –methanol - acetonitrile (500:350:150, v/v); LINE C: 100% methanol; LINE D: 100% water; 2 liters 20 mM Na 2HPO 4= 5.68 g; 2 liters 20 mM NaH 2PO4.2H 2O = 6.24 g.Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 software ( IBM, Chicago, IL ).Missing data, if any, were replaced using the last observed value or series mean [36].One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze base-line demographic data.
Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) with repeated measures was used to analyze logically-related variables. The Wilks ’Lambda time and group × time p-levels were used to assess the overall MANOVA effects.Univariate tests from the MANOVA are presented to show individual variable results.In someinstances, quadratic interaction p-levels are reported indi- cating that non-linear but significant differences were observed among groups over time.On select variables,delta values or percent change values were calculated and analyzed by ANOVA with repeated measures in order to evaluate the change in values from baseline.Data wereconsidered statistically significant when the p-value was less than 0.05 while trends were considered when p-values ranged between 0.05 and 0.10.Tukey ’s least significant difference (LSD) post hoc analyses were used to determine where the significance was obtained.Cohen ’sdcalcula- tions for effect size were performed to assess magnitudeof effect.
Non-significant data that showed moderate to large effects sizes were also noted as trends for follow-up with larger sample populations. Data are presented asmeans ± standard deviation, except group means were presented ± standard error of the mean.Results A total of 32 apparently healthy, recreationally active fe- males completed the protocol for the present study.Partici-pants were 21.5 ± 2.8 years, 60.5 ± 6.1 kg, 40.2 ± 3.8 kg fat free mass, and 26.7 ± 5.8% body fat.One-way ANOVA ana- lysis revealed no significant differences (p > 0.05) betweengroups at baseline for age, weight, fat free mass, body fat percentage, muscle carnosine, or muscle phosphagen levels.Muscle carnosine and phosphagen levels Table 1 presents muscle carnosine and phosphagen levels observed in the present study.Muscle samples wereKresta et al.Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2014, 11:55 Page 5 of 15 http://www.jissn.com/content/11/1/55 obtained from 31 total participants.
There was suffi- cient sample to analyze 27 samples for carnosine and 19 samples for phosphagen levels. Repeated measures ANOVA analysis revealed no significant time (p = 0.22)o r t i m e×g r o u p ( p=0 .8 2 ) e f f e c t s a m o n g g r o u p s i n muscle carnosine levels while a significant group effect (p = 0.04) was observed with supplementation.Post hocanalysis revealed that mean muscle carnosine levels in the PLA group were significantly lower than all other groups.One-way ANOVA of percent changes in musclecarnosine levels suggested that those in the BA and BAC groups observed the greatest increase in muscle carnosine levels; however, these apparent differences were notsignificantly different among groups (BA 35.3 ± 45; BAC 42.5 ± 99; CRE 0.72 ± 27; PLA 13.9 ± 44%, p = 0.59).
Repeated measures MANOVA analysis on muscle creatine(Cr), phosphocreatine (PCr), and total creatine (Cr tot) content revealed no overall Wilks ’Lamda time (p = 0.22) or time by group (0.80) effects among groups. Univariaterepeated measures ANOVA revealed significant quadratic differences among groups in changes in PCr (p q=0 .0 5 ) .However, differences observed could not be attributedto creatine supplementation.Delta analysis revealed that Cr totlevels increased to a greater degree after one week of loading (BA −3.57 ± 31; BAC 12.04 ± 36; CRE 6.86 ± 26; PLA −3.57 ± 31 mmol/kg DW) but these changes were not maintained during the maintenance period (BA 11.2 ± 17; BAC 0.13 ± 36; CRE −8.23 ± 29; PLA 11.2 ± 17 mmol/kg DW) and no time × group effectswere observed among groups (p = 0.79).Body composition Table 2 presents changes in body composition and body water.A MANOVA was run on body weight and DEXA determined fat mass, fat free mass, and percent bodyfat.
An overall Wilks ’Lamda time effect was observed (p < 0.001) with no significant Wilks ’Lamda time by group effects (p = 0.57). Repeated measures univariateANOVA analysis revealed significant time effects in changes in body weight (p < 0.01), fat mass (p = 0.05), fat free mass (p < 0.001), and body fat (p = 0.02).How-ever, no significant time × group effects were observed.
No significant time (p = 0.79) or time × group (p = 0.36) effects were observed in percent total body water.Table 1 Muscle carnosine, creatine, phosphocreatine, and total creatine over 4 weeks BA BAC CRE PLA Time P value Carnosine (μmol/g) Baseline 19.74 ± 8.69 20.81 ± 7.66 20.80 ± 2.81 15.70 ± 4.70 19.27 ± 6.50 T = 0.224 Weeks 23.68 ± 1.56 24.23 ± 4.09 21.04 ± 7.00 16.53 ± 4.80 21.37 ± 5.31 G = 0.04Group 21.71 ± 1.44 d22.52 ± 1.34d20.92 ± 1.44d16.12 ± 1.70abcT × G = 0.82 Creatine (mmol/kg DW) Baseline 47.13 ± 19.88 59.82 ± 37.7 72.96 ± 29.59 59.85 ± 7.79 59.92 ± 27.6 T q= 0.07 1 Week 50.73 ± 26.83 65.49 ± 15.25 88.55 ± 38.72 68.17 ± 7.74 67.80 ± 24.9 G = 0.144 Weeks 42.33 ± 16.24 59.90 ± 9.77 67.72 ± 15.94 57.19 ± 8.07 57.28 ± 14.3 T × G = 0.99Group 46.73 ± 8.26 61.74 ± 6.24 76.4 ± 8.26 61.74 ± 8.26 Phosphocreatine (mmol/kg DW) Baseline 22.18 ± 4.28 22.94 ± 18.02 31.69 ± 16.54 21.35 ± 4.44 24.29 ± 13.3 T = 0.10 1 Week 25.91 ± 9.88 32.61 ± 19.62 23.43 ± 4.40 24.08 ± 4.23 27.47 ± 13.0 G = 0.98 4 Weeks 34.75 ± 7.38 † b26.87 ± 7.04a30.51 ± 6.26 31.43 ± 9.39 30.25 ± 7.49 T × G q= 0.05 Group 27.61 ± 4.69 27.47 ± 3.54 28.55 ± 4.69 25.62 ± 4.69 Total creatine (mmol/kg DW) Baseline 63.04 ± 23.30 82.75 ± 37.19 105.11 ± 26.57 80.76 ± 11.18 82.89 ± 29.8 T = 0.761 Week 59.47 ± 27.07 94.79 ± 8.30 111.98 ± 37.99 85.53 ± 4.39 89.02 ± 26.8 G = 0.024 Weeks 74.28 ± 11.40 82.89 ± 5.32 96.89 ± 14.61 85.91 ± 18.07 84.66 ± 13.4 T × G = 0.79Group 65.60 ± 7.65 bc86.81 ± 5.78a104.66 ± 7.65a84.07 ± 7.65 Repeated measures ANOVA was performed on n = 27 (muscle carnosine) and a repeated measures MANOVA was performed on n = 19 (muscle phosphagen) samples.

No significant differences were observed among groups in pre-exercise lactate levels.MANOVA analysis revealed no overall Wilks ’Lamda time (p = 0.33) or group × time (p = 0.34) effects.ANOVA univariate analysis revealed a significant time × group interaction (p = 0.05) was observed in peak lactate amonggroups.Post-hoc analysis revealed that participants in the BA group had a significantly higher baseline peak lactate response than other groups and that peak lactate levelsdecreased after 4-weeks of supplementation after BA supplementation despite performing similar amounts of work.
Participants in the BA group also experiencedsignificantly less change in resting to maximal lactate levels despite performing similar amounts of work afterTable 2 Changes in body weight, body composition, and body water BA (n = 8)BAC (n = 9)CRE (n = 8)PLA (n =7)Time P value Body weight (kg) Baseline 63.16 ± 7.48 59.18 ± 5.42 61.15 ± 5.68 58.60 ± 5.81 60.54 ± 6.10 T = 0.011 Week 63.32 ± 7.30 59.33 ± 5.32 61.38 ± 5.94 59.22 ± 6.07 60.82 ± 6.11 G = 0.504 Weeks 63.60 ± 7.28 60.16 ± 5.02 61.26 ± 5.65 59.44 ± 5.88 61.14 ± 5.91 † T × G = 0.49 Group 63.36 ± 2.14 59.56 ± 2.02 61.26 ± 2.14 59.09 ± 2.29 Fat mass (kg) Baseline 16.49 ± 4.93 14.10 ± 3.27 14.30 ± 4.88 14.76 ± 3.94 14.89 ± 4.19 T = 0.05 1 Week 15.52 ± 4.30 13.17 ± 2.57 13.86 ± 4.79 13.84 ± 4.07 14.08 ± 3.88 † G = 0.50 4 Weeks 16.59 ± 4.67 12.99 ± 3.01 13.44 ± 3.00 14.02 ± 4.39 14.23 ± 3.88 T × G = 0.57Group 16.20 ± 1.38 13.42 ± 1.30 13.89 ± 1.38 14.21 ± 1.47 Fat free mass (kg) Baseline 41.08 ± 4.20 39.77 ± 4.42 41.36 ± 3.33 38.40 ± 3.18 40.19 ± 3.35 T = 0.0001 Week 42.05 ± 3.78 40.86 ± 4.65 42.06 ± 3.17 39.86 ± 3.38 41.23 ± 3.76 † G = 0.59 4 Weeks 41.40 ± 4.35 41.72 ± 4.44 42.55 ± 3.85 39.92 ± 3.09 41.45 ± 3.93 † T × G = 0.17 Group 41.51 ± 1.35 40.78 ± 1.27 41.99 ± 1.35 39.40 ± 1.44 Percent fat (%) Baseline 28.23 ± 6.72 26.03 ± 5.25 25.25 ± 6.62 27.51 ± 5.34 26.71 ± 5.84 T = 0.021 Week 26.51 ± 5.08 24.40 ± 4.56 24.34 ± 6.52 25.46 ± 5.23 25.14 ± 5.19 † G = 0.62 4 Weeks 28.25 ± 6.34 23.76 ± 5.14 23.88 ± 4.11 25.60 ± 5.94 25.32 ± 5.48 † T × G = 0.45 Group 27.66 ± 1.88 24.73 ± 1.78 24.49 ± 1.88 26.19 ± 2.02 Total body water (%) Baseline 51.31 ± 4.09 53.79 ± 6.56 48.86 ± 5.48 50.90 ± 4.48 51.30 ± 5.33 T = 0.661 Week 51.27 ± 3.83 52.56 ± 4.22 50.53 ± 3.61 50.01 ± 3.39 51.15 ± 3.72 G = 0.444 Weeks 50.61 ± 3.06 53.33 ± 3.96 51.66 ± 3.66 50.53 ± 3.08 51.59 ± 3.66 T × G = 0.30 Group 51.07 ± 1.45 53.23 ± 1.35 50.35 ± 1.47 50.48 ± 1.45 Individual group and time data are presented as means ± SD while time and group effects are presented as means ± SEM.

Peak Power (PP)normalized to body weight demonstrated a significant time × group × Wingate interaction (p = 0.02). Relative mean power, total work, and rate of fatigue significantlydecreased from the first to second Wingate anaerobic capacity tests.Significant time × Wingate × group effects were observed among groups in relative peak power(p = 0.02) and rate of fatigue (p = 0.04).Post-hoc analysis demonstrated that placebo relative peak power and rate of fatigue values were lower than other groups at base-line no differences among groups after 1 or 4 weeks of supplementation.Additionally, relative peak power in the second sprint test in the CRE group was significantlygreater than PLA values after 4 weeks of supplementation.Rate of fatigue after 4-weeks of supplementation was sig- nificant higher in the BA group compared to initial fatiguevalues when performing the second Wingate test before supplementation.
Effect size analysis Results from effect size calculations (Cohen ’sd)a r e presented in Table 6. Cohen ’sdeffect size calculations were performed to compare supplementation group means to placebo after four weeks of supplementationto assess magnitude of effects.In comparison to pla- cebo responses, BA supplementation resulted in large effects sizes for muscle carnosine ( −2.00), muscle creat- ine (1.16), and rate of fatigue after the first ( −1.44) and second ( −1.25) Wingate test; BAC supplementation resulted in large effect sizes for muscle carnosine(−1.73) and rate of fatigue following the first Wingate test ( −0.90); while CRE supplementation resulted in large effect sizes for changes in muscle creatine ( −0.83) and moderate effect sizes for changes in muscle carno- sine ( −0.75), fat free mass ( −0.69), and peak power d u r i n gt h ef i r s tW i n g a t et e s t( −0.83).
These findings indicate that follow-up study with a larger sample size may reveal additional statist ically significant findings among groups in these variables.Table 3 Aerobic exercise capacity results observed among groups BA (n = 8)BAC (n = 8)CRE (n = 8)PLA (n =6)Time P value VO2peak (ml/kg/min) Baseline 41.50 ± 5.60 40.85 ± 6.98 34.20 ± 5.73 35.88 ± 9.65 38.26 ± 7.33 T = 0.541 Week 41.58 ± 5.96 39.89 ± 7.62 36.10 ± 6.04 33.75 ± 10.5 38.10 ± 7.72 G = 0.204 Weeks 41.53 ± 6.12 39.35 ± 6.96 35.34 ± 2.98 37.90 ± 9.03 38.57 ± 6.52 T × G q= 0.07 Group 41.53 ± 2.35 40.03 ± 2.35 35.21 ± 2.35 35.84 ± 2.72 Time to exhaustion (sec) Baseline 1,249 ± 210 1,185 ± 303 963 ± 289 1,093 ± 324 1,125 ± 290 T = 0.30 1 Week 1,294 ± 246 1,196 ± 360 1,020 ± 251 1,032 ± 314 1,142 ± 303 G = 0.244 Weeks 1,293 ± 240 1,173 ± 319 1,046 ± 198 1,083 ± 310 1,153 ± 273 T × G q= 0.13 Group 1,279 ± 97 1,185 ± 97 1,010 ± 97 1,069 ± 112 METS Baseline 11.88 ± 1.60 11.63 ± 2.00 9.79 ± 1.64 10.27 ± 2.77 10.93 ± 2.09 T = 0.561 Week 11.88 ± 1.70 11.41 ± 2.19 10.31 ± 1.74 9.63 ± 3.00 10.89 ± 2.21 G = 0.204 Weeks 11.85 ± 1.74 11.25 ± 1.98 10.09 ± 0.85 10.83 ± 2.54 11.02 ± 1.86 T × G q= 0.07 Group 11.87 ± 0.67 11.43 ± 0.67 10.06 ± 0.37 10.24 ± 0.78 Ventilatory threshold (%VO 2peak ) Baseline 86.81 ± 8.73 86.44 ± 10.73 77.01 ± 6.46 85.75 ± 10.64 83.89 ± 9.68 T < 0.0011 Week 84.06 ± 7.34 85.35 ± 10.47 78.61 ± 10.53 84.78 ± 11.03 83.30 ± 9.79 G = 0.444 Weeks 78.59 ± 9.75 78.26 ± 13.02 76.50 ± 11.21 75.30 ± 9.63 77.29 ± 10.58 †ǂ T × G = 0.19 Group 83.15 ± 2.92 83.35 ± 2.92 77.38 ± 2.92 82.29 ± 3.73 Individual group and time data are presented as means ± SD while time and group effects are presented as means ± SEM.

We hypothesized that co-supplementation of β-ALA and creatine monohydrate may lead to greater ergogenic and performance adapta-tions by synergistically enhancing anaerobic threshold, aerobic capacity, time to exhaustion, and/or the ability to perform repeated 30-second sprints. Results revealed thatalthough some benefits were found from β-ALA and cre- atine supplementation, there appeared to be little additive benefits from co-supplementation in recreationally activewomen.The following provides additional assessment of results observed.Muscle carnosine and phosphagens Harris and colleagues [3] reported that β-ALA supple- mentation (3.2 g/day) resulted in a 42% increase in muscle carnosine levels after four weeks of supplementation.Results in the present study showed a mean increase inmuscle carnosine levels of 35.3 ± 45% following BA supplementation and 42.5 ± 99% following BAC supple- mentation with average doses of 6.1 ± 0.7 g/day of β-ALA.
While these mean changes in muscle carnosine levels following β-ALA supplementation are consistent with values reported in other studies [3,10,37-40] and we foundsome group effects with large effect sizes, no statistically significant interactions were observed among groups in muscle carnosine levels.
The lack of statistical significancewas apparently due to the large variability in muscle carno- sine levels observed in response to β-ALA supplementation,Table 4 Blood lactate results observed during the maximal exercise test BA (n = 8)BAC (n = 9)CRE (n = 8)PLA (n =7)Time P value Resting lactate (mmol/L) Baseline 1.44 ± 0.64 1.51 ± 0.44 1.33 ± 0.24 2.03 ± 0.96 1.56 ± 0.63 T = 0.711 Week 1.60 ± 0.61 1.43 ± 0.58 1.18 ± 0.28 1.54 ± 0.46 1.43 ± 0.51 G = 0.154 Weeks 1.58 ± 0.43 1.36 ± 0.49 1.53 ± 0.47 1.66 ± 0.45 1.52 ± 0.45 T × G = 0.38Group 1.54 ± 0.12 1.43 ± 0.11 1.34 ± 0.12 1.74 ± 0.13 Peak lactate (mmol/L) Baseline 12.91 ± 4.48 bcd8.63 ± 3.34a9.71 ± 1.83a7.54 ± 2.26 9.73 ± 3.64 T = 0.10 1 Week 10.43 ± 2.27 8.93 ± 3.18 9.20 ± 2.15 8.76 ± 1.25 9.33 ± 2.36 G = 0.074 Weeks 9.85 ± 1.89 † 8.04 ± 2.59 8.99 ± 1.46 8.64 ± 2.28 8.87 ± 2.12 T × G = 0.05 Group 11.06 ± 0.77 bd8.54 ± 0.73a9.30 ± 0.77 8.31 ± 0.83a Lactate threshold (% Peak VO 2) Baseline 65.18 ± 8.37 67.12 ± 14.08 66.09 ± 7.54 66.40 ± 10.14 66.22 ± 7.45 T = 0.141 Week 68.86 ± 5.98 69.92 ± 7.44 67.31 ± 6.64 64.51 ± 6.88 67.82 ± 6/75 G = 0.914 Weeks 67.04 ± 7.66 69.04 ± 6.91 69.61 ± 9.42 73.53 ± 5.83 69.67 ± 7.58 T × G = 0.86Group 67.03 ± 1.73 68.70 ± 1.63 67.67 ± 1.73 68.15 ± 1.85 Onset of blood lactate (%VO 2peak ) Baseline 77.50 ± 9.89 82.94 ± 10.9 81.71 ± 8.82 83.81 ± 8.82 81.47 ± 9.54 T = 0.131 Week 78.50 ± 10.1 84.90 ± 9.30 83.48 ± 7.67 75.17 ± 17.43 80.82 ± 11.5 G = 0.584 Weeks 84.14 ± 8.35 86.68 ± 8.51 83.76 ± 11.68 84.77 ± 11.93 84.90 ± 9.70 T × G = 0.81Group 80.05 ± 2.61 84.84 ± 2.46 82.98 ± 2.61 81.25 ± 2.79 Blood lactate difference from baseline to max (mmol/L) Baseline 11.48 ± 4.19 bcd7.10 ± 3.52a8.39 ± 1.75ad5.51 ± 2.15ac8.17 ± 3.67 T = 0.08 1 Week 8.83 ± 2.64 † 7.43 ± 3.31 8.03 ± 2.03 7.20 ± 1.59 7.88 ± 2.49 G = 0.06 4 Weeks 8.28 ± 1.88 † 6.61 ± 2.73 7.46 ± 1.26 6.81 ± 2.24 7.28 ± 2.12 T × G = 0.02 Group 9.53 ± 0.79 7.05 ± 0.74 7.96 ± 0.79 6.51 ± 0.84 Individual group and time data are presented as means ± SD while time and group effects are presented as means ± SEM.

More research is needed to determine the effects of β-ALA sup- plementation on muscle carnos ine levels in recreationally- active women.In terms of muscle phosphagen changes, it is import- ant to note that the sample size for muscle creatine and phosphagen assessment was quite small due to prioritiz- ing muscle carnosine assays as well as some samples notbeing large enough to run the appropriate assays.There- fore, statistical power is relatively low on these data.The creatine dosages used in the present study (0.3 g/kg/dayof creatine for week 1 and 0.1 g/kg/day for weeks 2 –4) are similar to those used with previous studies that indicate significant increases in muscle creatine after aloading and maintenance phase [19,21].
Results from the present study found non-significant increases in muscle creatine (+21%, +9.4%) and total creatine con-tent (+6.5%, +14.5%) following creatine and β-ALA pluscreatine supplementation after 1-week of loading and 3-weeks of maintenance doses, respectively. While overall results were not statistically significant, mean changesobserved support previous studies that have reported that creatine loading (e.g., 20 g/day or 0.3 g/kg/d for 5 to 7-days) results in an increase in muscle creatine contentby 10 –40% [16,19-21,31,41] and a large effect size was observed following creatine supplementation.While the lack of significance may have simply been a result ofthe small sample size, it is also known that there is individual variability in response to creatine supplementa- tion [19-21].Additionally, measurement of muscle PCrlevels can be challenging.It is also possible that sex may have played a role in response to creatine and/or β-ALA supplementation.
In this regard, most studies on creatine and β-ALA supple- mentation have been conducted on males and there is some evidence that females may respond differently tocreatine and/or β-ALA supplementation. For example, Fosberg and colleagues [42] reported that females had greater total creatine amounts relative to tissue weight;however, other studies show there is no difference between males and females [40,43].There are also some data sug- gesting that men may have greater muscle carnosine levelsthan women [4,44]; however, a recent study showed sex did not have an effect on increasing carnosine levels with supplementation [40].Additionally, Bex and coworkers [45]reported that carnosine loading is more pronounced in trained versus untrained indi viduals.Thus, it is possible that sex and/or the types and/or amounts of training per-formed among participants may have influenced response to creatine and/or β-ALA supplementation.
Body composition As expected, body weight and markers of body compos- ition improved over time during training in all groups.However, no significant differences were observed among groups. These findings support findings that females may experience less changes in body mass and/or fat free massin response to creatine supplementation during training than is typically observed in men [16].Present findings also support Kendrick et al.[39] who found that 10-weeksofβ-ALA supplementation (6.4 g/day) had no effects on body composition.However, Hoffman and associates [22] reported that supplementation of β-ALA with creatine promoted greater gains in lean body mass compared to creatine alone in male strength/power athletes.Smith and colleagues [12] reported that beta alanine supplementationduring high-intensity interval training in men promoted improvements in exercise capacity and lean body mass.
Additionally, Kern and Robinson [46] reported that β- ALA supplementation (4 g/day for 8 weeks) in college wrestlers and football players augmented performance and increased lean mass accrual.

Aerobic exercise performance Creatine supplementation has been purported to provide a mild effect on aerobic exercise capacity possibly through an increase in anaerobic thresho ld although the literature is mixed on this relationship [16]. Baguet et al.[9], used a similar supplementation protocol for β-ALA as the present study with physically active males and found no effectson VO 2peak as a result of supplementation.Stout and colleagues [13] measured the effects of β-ALA supple- mentation on VT in females.They supplemented for28 days and found that VT and time to exhaustion were increased in the β- A L Ag r o u p .T h ep r e s e n ts t u d yw a s unable to show similar results with β-ALA supplementa- tion groups.There was a slight trend with the creatine only group towards improvement in time to VO 2peak,b u t this was not statistically significant.
The lack of signifi-cance in the present study could be due to differences in training programs among participants and/or low power and effect size of the data. It is unlikely that familiaritywas a major factor as all participants underwent famil- iarization tests on the cycle e rgometer prior to starting the study protocol.Blood lactate and lactate threshold The increase in muscle carnosine following supplemen-tation would theoretically reduce blood lactate levelsduring submaximal exercise and/or increase LT since one of the main functions of carnosine is as an intramuscular pH buffer.Although the carnosine results between groupsin the present study were not significant, the groups sup- plemented with β-ALA showed greater percent changes compared to those without.The percent increase alsocompares closely to previous studies with significant results [3], therefore some inferences can be made based on this trend.
The present study found a significant differ-ence in peak lactate achieved during the maximal aerobic capacity test for the group supplementing with β-ALA over the combined supplementation and placebo. How- ever, the study failed to show any differences with LT between the groups, only a trend of β-ALA supplementa- tion improving levels after one week.Previous studies have reported mixed results pertaining to the effect of β-ALA and creatine supplementation on blood lactate accumulation and LT.Van Thienen and colleagues [47] reported no difference between groups in blood lactate levels in healthy males after an incremental maximalcycle ergometer test followed by a 30 second all out sprint after eight weeks of supplementation with β-ALA (2 –3g / d weeks 1 –4a n d4g / df o rw e e k s4 –8) or placebo.Zoeller et al.

Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2014, 11:55 Page 12 of 15 http://www.jissn.com/content/11/1/55 (3–6 g/d), creatine (5 g/d), a combination or placebo for 28 days and reported a greater VO 2peak at LT for the combined supplementation group, suggesting that thissupplementation protocol may delay the onset of LT during incremental exercise.The present study may have failed to show improve- ments in lactate accumulation and LT with β-ALA alone or the combined β-ALA and creatine supplementation strategy for various reasons.First, the power analysisand effect size calculations were low, which indicates the strength of the data could be improved, possibly with a larger sample size.Also, the present study examined theeffects of supplementation in recreationally active females, who did not engage in a standardized training program during the four weeks of the study.
Perhaps with a trainingprogram, like one seen in other studies, there may have been training effects seen for lactate variables. Finally, since we did not observe statistically significant differencesin muscle carnosine or phosphagen levels due to large variation in response to the supplementation protocol, variability in measurement, and/or low statistical power; itis possible that this may have limited the potential ergo- genic benefit.Anaerobic exercise performance Creatine supplementation has been consistently reported to increase anaerobic sprint and/or exercise capacity [16].For example, Kreider and colleagues [48] reported that creatine supplementation (15 g/day for 28-days) signifi- cantly increased repetitive sprint performance and musclemass during training in college football players.Wiroth and colleagues [49] reported that creatine supplementa- tion improved maximal power and work during a set of5 × 10 second sprints on the cycle ergometer.
Green and colleagues [50] reported that creatine supplementation (20 g/day for 6-days) increased PP during the first armWingate test and the decline in performance was less after the second leg Wingate test. Ziegenfuss et al.[51] also showed that creatine supplementation in college athletesresulted in increased TW and PP during multiple maximal 10-sec sprints on a cycle ergometer.Results from the present study, however, did not reveal an ergogenic benefitwhen performing repeated 30-sec anaerobic capacity tests.These findings may be related to the length of the sprint which is generally more dependent on glycolytic capacityrather than phosphagen availability.A number of studies have also reported that β-ALA supplementation provides ergogenic benefit during highintensity exercise [1,2,5,44,47].For example, Hill and colleagues [10] reported that 10-weeks of β-ALA supple- mentation significantly increased total work performedduring high-intensity cycling by approximately 13%.
Van Thienen et al. [47] reported that β-ALA supplementa- tion (2.4 g/day for 8-weeks) significantly increased sprintperformance at the end of an exhausted endurance cycling exercise bout.Hoffman et al.[52] reported that β-ALA supplementation (4.5 g/day for 3-weeks) in college football players tended to decrease fatigue rate during sprint exercise (p = 0.07).Another study by this group [22] examined the effects of creatine alone, β-ALA and creat- ine combined and placebo supplementation for 10-weeks in strength power athletes.The researchers reported some beneficial effects on improvements in strengthand lean tissue accretion from β-ALA and/or creatine supplementation.Tobias et al.[53] reported that β-ALA supplementation (6.4 g/day for 4-weeks) significantlyimproved repetitive anaerobic capacity while performing 4 × 30-sec sprints in judo and jujitsu athletes.
Similarly, De Salles Painelli and coworkers [54] reported that β-ALA supplementation (6.4 g/day for 4-weeks) significantly im- proved anaerobic capacity while performing 4 × 30-sec sprints in untrained and trained men. In the present study,there was some evidence that β-ALA supplementation may have led to an improvement in rate of fatigue after four weeks of supplementation.However, we did notfind that β-ALA with creatine supplementation improved repetitive bouts of 30-sec sprint performance in recre- ationally active women.It is possible that greater benefitsmay have been observed from performing more than two 30-sec Wingate sprints as noted above and/or longer sprints.In this regard, Hobson et al.[11] reported that β- ALA supplementation was effective in improving sprint performance in tasks lasting longer than 60-seconds.Saunders et al.[55] tested this theory in a study utilizingthe YoYo Intermittent Recovery Test in participants sup- plementing with β-ALA for 12 weeks.
This test is designed to assess the ability to perform and recover from multiplesprints, as seen in many sports. They found supplementa- tion improved performance on this test and suggested it was due to enhanced muscle buffering capabilitiesbetween bouts of high intensity exercise resulting from the increased muscle carnosine due to supplementation with β-ALA [55].However, more research is needed to examine the potential ergogenic value of β-ALA with and without creatine monohy drate supplementation in this population.Conclusion This is one of the first studies to use a more individualizeddosing strategy for β-ALA supplementation instead of providing a standardized amount β-ALA for all partici- pants irrespective of difference in body mass.Althoughthe mean increases in muscle carnosine levels were similar to those reported in the literature, changes in muscle car- nosine levels were not statistically increased in the presentstudy.
The lack of significance may have been due to the dosing strategy employed in that the calculated doses may not have been great enough to elicit positive responses.Kresta et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 2014, 11:55 Page 13 of 15 http://www.jissn.com/content/11/1/55 Additionally, there may be a sex effect with females need- ing a different amount of β-ALA to consistently increase muscle carnosine levels compared to males.Further, thesmall sample size of the present study resulting in low power and effect sizes in some instances may have contributed to the lack of significant findings as previousresearch has demonstrated that four weeks of creatine and β-ALA supplementation was sufficient to increase muscle carnosine and phosphagen levels.Moreover, results of thepresent study did not show supplementation to have sig- nificant effects on body composition, aerobic or anaerobic performance measures.
However, perhaps a greater totalamount of β-ALA is needed to be ingested over time in women in order for performance adaptations to occur, especially without the addition of a standardized exercisetraining program. Further studies should be conducted to examine the potential independent and synergistic effects of a combined supplementation of creatine, β-ALA, and other purported nutritional ergogenic aids in untrained and trained male and female populations.Additionally, future studies should examine the effects of combinedsupplementation on muscle carnosine and phosphagen levels in a larger and/or more active population.Competing interests All researchers involved independently collected, analyzed, and interpreted the results from this study and have no financial interests concerning the outcome of the investigation.
