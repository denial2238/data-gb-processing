High L-Carnitine Levels Impede Viral Control in Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection Shuqin Gu†, Xin Fu†, Guofu Ye, Chengcong Chen, Xiaoyi Li, Shihong Zhong, Libo Tang, Haitao Chen, Deke Jiang, Jinlin Hou and Yongyin Li* State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis Research, Department of Infectious Diseases, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China Persistent antigen exposure during chronic hepatitis B infection leads to exhausted immune responses, thus impeding viral control.In recent years, immunometabolismopens new therapeutic possibilities for the modulation of immune responses.Herein, weinvestigated the immunomodulatory effect of L-carnitine (L-Cn) on immune cells in chronicHBV infection.
In this study, 141 treatment-naïve patients with chronic HBV infection, 38patients who achieved HBsAg loss following antiviral treatment, and 47 patients whosuffered from HBV-related HCC from real-life clinical practice were recruited. The plasmaL-Cn levels were measured by ELISA.RNA sequencing was conducted to de ﬁne the transcriptional pro ﬁles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells after L-Cn stimulation.In vitro assays were performed to assess the effect of L-Cn on immune cells; the frequencies andfunction of immune cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.We found that compared with patients with HBsAg loss, patients with HBsAg positivity and patients who suffered fromHBV-related HCC had higher levels of L-Cn, and the plasma levels of L-Cn in the HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis patients who had elevated ALT were signi ﬁcantly higher than that of HBeAg-negative chronic infection and HBsAg loss groups.
Moreover, a positive correlation between plasma levels of L-Cn and HBsAg levels was found. Additionally,RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that L-Cn altered the transcriptional pro ﬁles related to immune response.In vitro assays revealed that L-Cn suppressed the proliferation of and IFN- gproduction by CD4 +and CD8+T cells.It also down-regulated the proliferation and IgG production of B cells.Notably, L-Cn enhanced IL-10 secretionfrom regulatory T cells and up-regulated the expression of inhibitory receptors on T cells.Moreover, a variant in CPT2 (rs1799821) was con ﬁrmed to be associated with L-Cn levels as well as complete response in CHB patients following Peg-IFN aantiviral therapy.Taken together, the immunosuppressive properties of L-Cn may hinder the control of HBV inchronic HBV infection, implicating that L-Cn manipulation might in ﬂuence the prognosis of patients with HBV infection.

doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.649197ORIGINAL RESEARCH published: 21 June 2021 doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.649197 INTRODUCTION Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a serious public health issue, which is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ( 1). Nucleos(t)ide-analogues are currently effective at inhibiting HBVreplication, and interferon (IFN) therapy can convert an activityinto an inactive infection.However, these treatment strategiescould not eliminate HBV because of the stability of covalentlyclosed circular DNA (cccDNA) in infected hepatocytes ( 2).An achievement of HBsAg loss represents the hallmark of resolution of HBV infection and is a therapeutic goal for a functional cure;unfortunately, this optimal outcome is rarely achieved ( 3,4).Therefore, investigating the underlying factors that go against theachievement of HBsAg loss during chronic HBV infectionis warranted.
The disorder of T cells mediated cellular immune response favored viral persistence and p athogenesis of hepatitis B ( 5). Inducing powerful HBV-speci ﬁcC D 4 +and CD8+Tc e l l responses and the production of HBV-related antibodiesdetermine the outcome of HBV infection.Recently,cumulative data from experimental and clinical studies havehighlighted the critical role of the metabolic milieu in regulating host immunity ( 6–10).Immune response requires distinct metabolic programs t o support immune cell survival, development, differentiation, fa t e ,a n db e h a v i o r .L - c a r n i t i n e( L - Cn) is essential to transport the chains of fatty acids into themitochondria for boxidation.The carnitine pool consists of free carnitine and acylcarnitine esters, which were bounded todifferent fatty acids.
In individuals, about 75% of L-Cn is obtained from the diet, and only 25% of it comes from endogenous biosynth esis with lysine and methionine in the kidney, liver, and brain; additionally, carnitine is notmetabolized but is excreted as free carnitine in urine. L-Cn isthe exclusively physiologically active form of free carnitine ( 11).A previous study has documented an association between lower baseline levels of plasma L-Cn and HBsAg loss in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients receiving Peg-IFN abased treatment (12).Furthermore, the report demonstrated that L-Cn limited the proliferation of HBV-speci ﬁcC D 8 +T cells.Besides, it has been shown that L-Cn displays immune suppressive propertiesin Crohn ’sd i s e a s e( 13,14).
On the contrary, previous studies demonstrated the protective eff ect of carnitine supplementation on ALT normalization in patients with CHB when combinedwith entecavir, improvement in sarcopenia and hyperammonemiain patients with liver cirrhosis, and hospital admissions reduction inpatients with hepatic encephalopathy ( 15–18). However, available ﬁndings regarding plasma L-Cn levels in patients with chronic HBV infection remain somewhat contradictory, and the effect of L-Cn on the expression of inhibitory receptors and the production of suppressive cytokines by immune cells have not yet been fullyelucidated.
In the present study, we aimed to investigate L-Cnproﬁles in patients with different statuses of chronic HBV infection as well as the immunomodulatory effect of L-Cn on immune cells in vitro , and factors that affect plasma L-Cn levels were also primarily explored.MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Subjects A total of 179 chronic HBV infection patients were enrolled for a cross-sectional study. One hundred and forty-one treatment-naïve patients were classi ﬁed into hepatitis B e antigen-negative chronic infection (HBeAg -CInf, n=44), HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis (HBeAg-CHep, n=20), HBeAg+CInf (n=36), and HBeAg+CHep (n=41) based on an issued clinical practice guideline ( 4).Thirty-eight CHB patients who achieved HBsAg loss (n=38) following antiviral treatment and 47 patients whosuffered from HBV-related HCC were recruited.Another 34HBsAg-negative healthy indiv iduals with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were enrolled as healthy controls (HCs) for the cross-sectional study.
Additionally, 648 HBeAg-positive CHB patients who treated with Peg-IFN aat the dose of 180 µg/week for 48 weeks and a treatment-free follow-upfor 24 weeks (Peg-IFN a-2a, n=324; Peg-IFN a-2b, n=324) were used to evaluate the association of single-nucleotidepolymorphism (SNP) rs1799821 genotype with complete response (CR, de ﬁned as HBeAg seroconversion and an HBV DNA level < 2000 IU/mL at week 72). Details of patients were previously reported ( 19,20).Patients suffering from autoimmune diseases, other active diseases, or coinfection withHAV, HCV, HDV, or HIV were excluded.All subjects wererecruited at Nanfang Hospital (Guangzhou, China).This studywas conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethical Committee of Nanfang Hospital.A written informed consent form was obtained fromall participants.
Serological Assays and HBV DNA Assays The levels of human serum HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, andHBeAb were quantitatively determined using the RocheCOBAS ®6000 analyzer (Roche Mole cular Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Levels of serum HBV DNA were quanti ﬁed by the Roche LightCycler®480 II (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Pleas anton, CA) with Hepatitis B Viral Quantitative Fluorescence Diagnostic Kit (SansureBiotech, Hunan, China).The lower limit of detection ofHBsAg is < 0.05 IU/mL.The detection limit of HBV DNA is n ol o w e rt h a n1 0 0I U / m L .T h en o r m a lr a n g e sf o rA L Ta n dA S T levels were 9-50 U/L and 15- 40 U/L, respectively.Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Plasma was immediately withdrawn and frozen at -20°C until use.
Plasma L-Cn levels were measured using one speci ﬁc ELISA kit (CUSABIA, Wuhan, China), and the concentration ofImmunoglobulin G (IgG) of cultured supernatant wasquanti ﬁed in duplicate wells by commercial IgG ELISA kits (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions. RNA-Sequencing and Data Analysis Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from fresh heparinized blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradientGu et al.L-Carnitine Impedes HBV Control Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 649197 2 centrifugation, and some cells were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for further analysis.Fresh PBMCs were obtained from3 treatment-naïve patients with chronic HBV infection and thenwere stimulated with L-Cn (20 mg/mL) or not for 3 days in anincubator at 37°C supplied with 5% CO 2.
Total RNA was directly extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) and subjected to library construction and deep sequencing on Illumina HiSeq™2500 by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Guangzhou, China). Gene expressionlevels were normalized based on the fragments per kilobasemillion reads (FPKM).Fold changes were calculated for allpossible comparisons and a two-fold cutoff was used to select genes with expression changes.All raw transcriptome data have been deposited in NCBI (SRA accession number: PRJNA673447,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA673447).GeneOntology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG), and Reactome pathway analysis were performed byGuangzhou Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co., Ltd.Cell Sorting Fresh isolated PBMCs were stained with anti-CD4-PE-Cy7, anti-CD8-APC, and anti-CD19-PE.The cell suspension was sorted bya BD Aria III ﬂow cytometer (BD Bioscience).Cell purity was > 99%.
Proliferation Assay Fresh isolated PBMCs or puri ﬁed T/B cells labeled carboxy ﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) were cultured with different concentration of L-Cn (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5days in the presence of soluble anti-CD3 (5 µg/mL, Biolegend)and anti-CD28 (5 µg/mL, Biolegend) for T cell proliferationassay or 7 days in the presence of CPG (10 µg/mL, InvivoGen)for B cell proliferation assay or with medium only as control. Atthe end of the culture, cells were harvested, stained with anti- CD4-PE-Cy7, anti-CD8-APC, or anti-CD19-PE, and were analyzed by a BD Canto II ﬂow cytometer.Dead cells were excluded using Live/Dead staining (Life Technologies).Theproliferation rate of each cel l subset was expressed as the percentage of cells that diluted CFSE intensity at least once.
Phenotype Analysis and Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS) Fresh isolated human PBMCs after stimulating with or without L-Cn (20 mg/mL) for 72 h in the presence of anti-CD3 (5 µg/mL,Biolegend) and anti-CD28 (5 µg/mL, Biolegend) were stainedwith ﬂuorescence phenotype antibodies at 4°C for 30 minutes and analyzed on a BD FACS-Canto II or Aria III ﬂow cytometer (BD Bioscience). To assess the effect of L-Cn on T cell subsets,PBMCs or puri ﬁed T cells were stimulated with or without L-Cn (20 mg/mL) in the presence of anti-CD3/CD28 (5 µg/mL) for72 h and restimulated with or without L-Cn for another 6 h inthe presence of PMA (50 ng/mL), ionomycin (0.75 µg/mL), and BFA (1 µg/mL).The ICS was performed as previously described (21).
Brie ﬂy, cells stained with the indicated antibodies (Supplementary Table 1 ) and then ﬁxed and permeabilized using a Cyto ﬁx/Cytoperm kit (BD Bioscience) or aTranscription Factor Buffer Set (BD Biosciences) and stained with the corresponding antibodies (IFN- g, IL-21, IL-10, FoxP3, TCF1, and Eomes). All ﬂow cytometric analysis was performed using FlowJo V10.0.7 software (Treestar).In Vitro Antibody Production and Enzyme- Linked Immunospot Assay (ELISPOT) To assess the effect of L-Cn on B cells, puri ﬁed CD19+B cells were cultured with or without L-Cn in the presence of CPG (2.5µg/mL, InvivoGen) and PWM (5 µg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) for 13days.The frequency of IgG-secreting B cells was determined using the ELISPOT assay.Brie ﬂy, PBMCs (5 × 10 5cells/well) were cultured in 200 uL RPMI-1640 medium/10%FBScontaining R848 (1 µg/mL) and rIL2 (10 ng/mL, Mabtech,Nacka Strand, Sweden) with or without L-Cn (10 mg/mL) for5 days in a round-bottomed 96-well plate.
Sterile ELISPOT plateswith a PVDF membrane (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA, USA) were coated with anti-human IgG (15 µg/mL, Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden) overnight at 4°C. After 5 days, the cells weretransferred to ELISPOT plates and incubated with or without L-Cn for an additional 24 h.The plates were subsequently washedand incubated with biotin-labeled anti-IgG mAb (Mabtech,Sweden) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin( M a b t e c h ,N a c k aS t r a n d ,S w e d e n ) .S p o t sw e r ec o u n t e db y Immuno-SpotS6 Ultra Analyzer (Cellular Technology, Inc., Santa Monica, CA).GEO Dataset We analyzed the microarray data from the Gene ExpressionOmnibus series GSE62595 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62595), which provides gene expression data from L-Cn-treated in vivo bovine embryos (Jersey and Holstein breeds, 4 L-Cn treated and 4 controls for each).
IL-21 , IFNG ,CD86 ,CD33 ,Arg1 ,CD8b ,PD-L1 ,CTLA4 , and HAVCR2 gene expression levels in the L-Cn-treated and control groupswere analyzed in this study. DNA Extraction and Genotyping Genomic DNA was extracted from PBMCs of patients using a TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China).The selected 7 SNPs in ALX3 ,CPT1B ,CPT2 ,DMGDH ,PEX5L , and SLC22A4 were genotyped using an improved multiplex polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (LDR)technique with technical support from Genesky BiotechnologyInc.(Shanghai, China).DNA sequencing was used to validate thegenotyping by LDR.Results of LDR corresponded with the results of sequencing for the randomly selected DNA samples from each genotype.Genotyping of rs1799821 in patients treatedwith Peg-IFN awas performed as previously described ( 20).Statistical Analysis All data are expressed as median (interquartile range).
Continuous variables were compared by Mann-Whitney ’sU test or Wilcoxon sighed-rank test when two groups werecompared. Kruskal-Wallis H test was used when more thantwo groups were compared, Friedman test was used when moreGu et al.L-Carnitine Impedes HBV Control Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 649197 3 than two repeated measures were compared, performing a post hoc test (Dunn ’s test) that applies correction for multiple comparisons.Correlations between variables were assessedwith Spearman ’s rank-order correlation coef ﬁcient.Categorical variables were compared by the Chi-square test.Multiple logisticregression analyses were used to adjust the confounding effect of baseline variables.SPSS Statistics 20.0 (Chicago, IL) and the GraphPad Prism 7 software were used for statistical analysis.Allthe tests were two-sides, and a Pvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant.
RESULTS Plasma L-Cn Levels Are Elevated in Chronic HBV Infection and HBV-Related HCC but Decreased in HBsAg Loss Firstly, we attempted to evaluate the plasma L-Cn status of patients with chronic HBV infection ( Table 1 ). A higher L-Cn level was observed in patients with chronic HBV infection(excluding HBsAg loss patients) or HCC, relative to HCs; moreover, L-Cn levels of patients with chronic HBV infection or HCC were higher than those who achieved HBsAg loss(Figure 1A ).The plasma level of L-Cn in the HBeAg +CHep group who had ﬂared ALT was signi ﬁcantly elevated than the HBeAg-CInf, HCs, and HBsAg loss groups ( Figure 1A ).We next examined whether plasma L-Cn levels were correlated or notwith serum biochemical and virological parameters.A positive correlation between plasma levels of L-Cn and serum levels ofALT and AST was found ( Figure 1B ).
Notably, such positive correlations were also observed between plasma L-Cn levels andHBsAg levels as well as HBeAg and HBV DNA levels(Figure 1C ). Further analysis revealed that plasma L-Cn levels were positively correlated with serum levels of total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and indirect bilirubin, but not with the serumalbumin levels, creatinine concentration, and liver stiffness(Figure 1D ).Together, these results indicated that persistent HBV infection might act on L-Cn metabolism and plasma levelsof L-Cn appear to be associated with the prognosis of chronic HBV infection.L-Cn Altered the Landscape of Gene Expression Pro ﬁles of PBMCs in Chronic HBV Infection To uncover the molecular mechanism of L-Cn that may be involved in reprogramming PBMCs after L-Cn stimulation,transcriptome pro ﬁling by RNA-Sequencing was conducted.
KEGG pathway enrichment analysis based on a subset of 168 genes that differentially expressed in the presence of L-Cn revealed changes in the gene sets related to metabolism,cellular processes, and information processing of PBMCs,particularly in the immune system, cancers, and infectiousdiseases ( Figure 2A ). Pathways of antigen processing and presentation, Th17 cell differentiation, and Th1 and Th2 celldifferentiation were signi ﬁcantly altered in the setting of TABLE 1 | Clinical characteristics of the study subjects.Group Healthy controlsHBeAg- chronic infectionHBeAg- chronic hepatitisHBeAg+ chronic infectionHBeAg+ chronic hepatitisHBsAg loss HBV-HCC No.of patients (M/F)34 (20/14) 44 (22/22) 20 (18/2) 36 (20/16) 41 (24/17) 38 (33/5) 47 (44/3) Age (year) 24.00 (23.00- 28.25)35.00 (31.00-43.00) 34.00 (26.00-43.00) 28.00 (25.00-33.00) 27.00 (24.00-32.50) 40.00 (34.00- 51.50)53.00 (44.00- 62.00) HBV DNA (lg IU/ mL)n.d.

Further analysis by Reactome Pathway Database showedsigni ﬁcant enrichment of differentially expressed genes associated with loading of antigenic peptides and disassociationof CLIP from MHC II ( Figure 2D ). These changes suggested L- Cn triggers multiple metabolic reprogramming and functional reinventing on immune cells.Excess L-Carnitine Impairs Immune Responses Against HBV Next, the in ﬂuence of L-Cn on immune cells against HBV was explored.PBMCs or puri ﬁed T/B cells were cultured in the presence or not of L-Cn in vitro .Relative to untreated cells, we found that L-Cn treatment on PBMCs signi ﬁcantly inhibited the proliferation of CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells in a dose- dependent manner ( Figures 3A, B ).G i v e nt h a tP B M C s contain a mixture of cell types, the effect of L-Cn was assessedon the sorted immune cell subsets.L-Cn stimulation (10 mg/mL) A C DB FIGURE 1 | Analyses of the L-Cn levels in cross-sectional cohorts.

A similar reduction in proliferation of CD19+B cells in PBMCs or puri ﬁed B cells was observed (Figures 3A, B ). Strikingly, reduced production of IL-21 by CD4+T cells, and decreased frequency of IFN- g-expressing CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells were observed in the presence of L-Cn ( Figures 3C, D ).I n t e r e s t i n g l y ,e x p o s u r et oL - C nresulted in decreased production of both IFN- gand IL-21 by puriﬁed CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells ( Figure 3D ).Notably, coculture with L-Cn resulted in signi ﬁcantly reduced frequencies of IgG-secreting B cells and a tendency of reduced production ofIgG in the supernatant by puri ﬁed CD19 +B cells, relative to the control group ( Figure 3E ).These ﬁndings collectively suggested that excess L-Cn abrogates T-cell and B-cell response, which A DB C FIGURE 2 | Transcriptomic analysis revealed multiple changes in PBMCs after L-Cn stimulation.

Next, to further verify theﬁndings as mentioned above in our study, the transcriptional proﬁles were analyzed by using a GEO microarray dataset (GSE62595), which was derived from L-Cn-treated in vivo bovine embryos. As shown in Figure 4F , the transcriptional levels of IL-21 and IFNG in the L-Cn-treated groups were signiﬁcantly lower than those in the control groups in both Jersey and Holstein cattle, which were consistent with the resultsof the available in vitro experiments, while the transcripts encoding immunosuppressive pro ﬁles, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( CD33 ), arginase-1 ( Arg1 ), and inhibitory receptors ( PD-L1 ,CTLA4 , and HAVCR2 ) were higher in the L- Cn-treated groups.
These data indicate that L-Cn contributes to the production of suppressive cytokine and the expression of inhibitory receptors, thus resulting in the persistence ofHBV infection.A Variant in CPT2 (rs1799821) Is Associated With L-Cn Levels and the Complete Response of CHB Patients Treated With Peg-IFN a Next, we tried to investigate the factors that in ﬂuence the levels of plasma L-Cn. To this end, we analyzed the associationbetween L-Cn and some reported SNPs ( Supplementary Figure 1 ).We found that, for SNP rs179982 (gene CPT2 ), patients with GG genotype had lower plasma L-Cn levels than those with AA genotype ( Figure 5A ).Then, 648 HBeAg-positive CHB patients treated with Peg-IFN awere used to evaluate the association between rs1799821 genotype and complete response(Table 2 ).
As shown in Figure 5B , after 48 weeks of therapy plus 24 weeks follow-up, 25.0%, 23.9%, and 15.7% of patients withrs1799821 GG, GA, and AA genotypes achieved CR, respectively.Patients carrying GG/GA genotypes displayed a higher rate of CR compared with those with AA genotype. Of note, there was a statistically signi ﬁcant association after adjustment for other covariates, such as gender, age, HBV genotype, baseline HBV A B FIGURE 5 | Association of CPT2 rs1799821 with plasma L-Cn levels and CR in patients treated with Peg-IFN a.(A)Association of plasma L-Cn levels with SNP rs1799821 genotype.(B)Association of SNP rs1799821 genotype with CR in patients treated with Peg-IFN a.(A)Kruskal-Wallis H test and Dunn ’s multiple comparisons test.(B)Chi-square test.* P< 0.05.CR, complete response.TABLE 2 | Baseline clinical characteristics of patients treated with Peg-IFN a.

These data implied that baseline L-Cn levels might be associated with thetreatment response of CHB patients. DISCUSSION Achievement of HBsAg loss re presents the hallmark for a functional cure of chronic HBV infection.Currently, there areno effective antivirus drugs that directly target HBsAg clearance.Functional T cells (with helpe r or cytotoxic effects) and antibody-producing B cells bene ﬁt HBV control.In recent years, immunometabolism opens new therapeutic possibilities for modulation of immune responses during infections and inﬂammatory diseases.In this study, we primarily investigated the immunomodulatory effect of L-Cn on immune cells inchronic HBV infection.L-Cn is essential to transport the chains of fatty acids into the mitochondria for boxidation.Manipulation of cell metabolic programs dictates T cell function and differentiation ( 10,22).
It has been reported that the serum L-Cn levels were stepwisealtered in HBV-cirrhosis and HCC, and plasma L-Cn levelsremain lower in patients with HBsAg loss after Peg-IFN abased treatment ( 12,23), suggesting L-Cn plays a critical role in affecting the outcome of chronic HBV infection. The presentstudy revealed a signi ﬁcant elevation of L-Cn in patients with chronic HBV infection and HBV-HCC.Of note, plasma L-Cn levels were positively correlated with plasma levels of ALT, AST,and bilirubin.Based on the ﬁnding that carnitine concentration within the liver is 25-50 times higher than that of plasma levels(11), we assumed that L-Cn might be derived from the leakage of hepatic carnitine; this hypot hesis should be elucidated in further studies.According to previously published data, the seemingly high doses of L-Cn demonstrating pharmacological activity withouttoxicity were selected for in vitro assays ( 14,24).
In the present study, we demonstrated that L-Cn stimulation signi ﬁcantly decreased T and B cell proliferation, IFN- g-secreting and IL- 21-producing T cells, and IgG-producing B cells. Previous publications have demonstrated the favorable effect of CD4 + helper T cells in facilitating HBV-speci ﬁc CD8+T cell response and enhancing HBV-related antibody production from B cellsthrough IL-21 ( 25–27).These results suggest that L-Cn may affect HBV control by downregulating cellular and humoralimmune responses.In contrast, L-Cn stimulation generatedmuch more IL-10-producing Treg cells and simultaneously up- regulated multiple inhibitory receptors on T cells, indicating aninhibitory effect on T cell response.It has been veri ﬁed that inhibitory molecules, such as PD1, CTLA4, Tim3, and 2B4, areupregulated on exhausted HBV-speci ﬁc T cells, which contribute to HBV persistence ( 28–30).
Moreover, we provide evidence that L-Cn administration altered the transcriptional pro ﬁles of immune cells and affected multiple core processes.Furthermore, we genotyped some SNPs that were reported tobe associated with L-Cn levels ( 31–33). Of note, we con ﬁrmed that SNP rs1799821 was strongly associated with plasma L-Cnlevels as reported.An interesting observation was that patientswho carried the rs1799821 G allele showed lower levels of plasma L-Cn and was associated with the complete response following Peg-IFN atherapy.Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that the immunosuppressive effect of L-Cn might be related to the failureof HBV control; reprogramming L-Cn metabolism may serve asa potential therapeutic target for HBV infection.Furtherexperiments are needed to clarify this hypothesis and the mechanisms underlying the immunoregulatory function of L-Cn.This study also showed that plasma L-Cn levels did not vary with age and sex ( Supplementary Figures 2A, B ).
It should be noted that around 75% L-Cn comes from diet and only 25%comes from endogenous synthesis with lysine and methionine in the kidney, liver, and brain; therefore, it is not surprising that L- Cn was dynamically regulated by dietary exposure ( 11). One month ’s red meat diet consumption had been shown a signi ﬁcant increase in plasma carnitine levels, relative to either non-meat orwhite meat diets ( 34).Interestingly, diet intervention seems to affect plasma L-Cn levels.Consistently, we found an increase ofplasma L-Cn levels following one week of the beef-rich diet; however, short-term beef provocation did not cause plasma L-Cn levels ﬂuctuation, which suggested L-Cn as a potential stable plasma biochemical marker ( Supplementary Figures 2C, D ).Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that shifting diet habits tocreate a low plasma L-Cn condition may improve the antiviralimmune response and favor the clinical outcome of chronic HBV infection.
Because almost all Chinese are omnivores, no vegetarian or strict vegetarian is enrolled for the L-Cnchallenge test; further experiments are needed to validate.Importantly, a study showed intestinal microbiota metabolismof dietary L-Cn to produce trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO),which accelerated the development of atherosclerosis ( 35). Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the transformationTABLE 3 | Association of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 ( CPT2 ) genotypes with complete response.CPT2 (SNP rs1799821) CR (n,%) NCR (n,%) OR (95% CI) P AOR* (95%CI) P AA 52 (40.63) 280 (53.85) Referent - Referent - Genotypic model GGvs.AA 10 (7.81) 30 (5.77) 1.80 (0.83-3.90) 0.14 1.67 (0.74-3.75) 0.21 GAvs.AA 66 (51.56) 210 (40.38) 1.71 (1.14-2.57) 9.78×10-31.70 (1.12-2.59) 0.01 Dominant model (GG/GA) vs.

Due to the limited availability of clinical specimens, especially from HBV-HCC andpatients who achieved HBsAg loss, future studies with morecases are needed to verify our ﬁndings further. Ideally, the correlation between plasma L-Cn levels and complete response should be stronger con ﬁrmed in the further longitudinal cohort study.Additionally, the RNA-sequencing of L-Cn-treatedPBMCs and the GSE62595 dataset can only show thetranscriptome changes at the overall level, further studies onexploring the modulation mechanism of L-Cn on a single set of cells should be taken to dissect the related signaling pathway.Moreover, the dose of L-Cn used in this study is over the range ofphysiological condition, the immunomodulatory effect of L-Cnon immune cells should be evaluated via in vivo experiments with the HBV mouse model.
Finally, it remains unknown if dietintervention could downregulate plasma L-Cn levels effectively.More healthy controls and patients with HBV infection should be recruited to perform a much more extended time diet intervention to con ﬁrm the conclusion. In summary, the present ﬁndings demonstrated that an elevated plasma L-Cn might precipitate the persistence of HBVinfection by exerting an immunosuppressive function, indicatinga bene ﬁcial effect of low L-Cn level in chronic HBV infection.Management strategy targeting L-Cn or shifting diet habits to less L-Cn intake might serve as a potential therapeuticintervention in HBV infection.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The datasets presented in this study can be found in onlinerepositories.The names of the repository/repositories and accession number(s) can be found below: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA673447.

To evaluate the in ﬂuence of diet intervention on plasma L-Cn levels, two male participants fasted overnight (10 h) before performing the short-term L-Cn challenge test, which included a natural source of L-Cn (240 g cooked-beef, a major source of dietary L-Cn, equivalent to an estimated 180 mg L-Cn), and venous blood samples were collected at indicated time points for L-Cn detection. After an overnight fast, subjects were challenged with 240 g cooked-beef (a major source of dietary L-Cn, be equivalent to an estimated 180 mg L-Cn).An additional one-week dietary intervention L-Cn challenge test was designed to examine the impact of dietary beef on L-Cn among another healthy adultparticipants (n=6, all omnivores, 3 males and 3 females, with normal renal function; age: minimum 23 years, median 28 years, and maximum 40 years; body mass index (BMI): minimum 18.60, median 20.13, and maximum 26.22).
After one month of their habitual diet, which was designed to re ﬂect serum L-Cn ﬂuctuation, the volunteers were shifted to a weeklong beef-rich diet (around 220 g cooked beef during each lunch and dinner, equivalent to an estimated 330 mg L-Cn per day).
