PROSPERO registration number CRD42020177919. INTRODUCTION Anabolic- androgenic steroids (AAS) are synthetic androgens with several potential effects.
In clinical settings, AAS can be used to treat conditions such as male hypogo- nadism, pathological loss of muscle mass and anaemia,1 with findings suggesting their efficacy in the treatment of depres- sion2 and conditions associated with type 2 diabetes.3 Beneficial effects of AAS include the increasing of muscle mass, feelings of well- being and boosted energy, enhancement of body image and improvement of athletic and occupational performance.4 5 However, the use of AAS can increase the risk of several adverse health conditions such as acne, testic- ular atrophy, gynecomastia, clitoromegaly, hypomania, anxiety, dyslipidaemia and high haematocrit—therefore, increasing the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.6 Despite the risks, many AAS users refrain from seeking physicians for AAS- related information or to treat health conditions potentially associated with the use of AAS.7 Among factors possibly influencing the prevalence of AAS seeking support from physicians are the legal status of AAS, AAS users’ engagement with health services and their perceptions of the services provided by physicians to people using AAS.8 In countries where the possession of AAS without a medical prescription is illegal, it is reasonable to expect that some AAS users will refrain from disclosing the use of AAS to a physician.9 The legal status of AAS can also influence the service provided to AAS users by physicians, as doctors are usually not allowed to prescribe AAS for the purposes of enhance- ment or to regulate hormonal levels after the use of AAS, a practice also known as postcycle therapy.10 While physicians are trained to STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY ⇒This review analyses 36 studies published between 1988 and 2021, involving 10 101 androgenic- anabolic steroids (AAS) users.

The objective of this study is to estimate the overall prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians by conducting a systematic review and meta- analysis of surveys and interviews with AAS users. The secondary objectives are to compare the prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians in different locations and among subpopulations of AAS users and discuss some of the factors that could have influenced their engagement with physicians’ support.METHODS Overview This systematic review and meta- analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses guidelines.25 As a review of the literature, this study is exempted from ethical clearance by King’s College London research ethics office.Search strategy and selection criteria A search strategy was designed to retrieve studies describing surveys and interviews with people using AAS.
Searches were performed on MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and SciELO in January 2022 with no restric- tions on the date, location and language of studies. The search algorithm adapted to each database can be found in online supplemental material etable 1.A online supplemental search was performed on the reference lists of eligible studies.Two independent researchers (JMXA and AK) performed the screening, data extraction and assessed the risk of bias.Disagreements were resolved by discussion with the third researcher (PD).Results of the searches were exported to Rayyan QCRI26 for screening and removing of duplicates.Titles, abstracts and the full text of studies were screened for eligibility against our inclusion and exclusion criteria (table 1).
A spreadsheet was used to summarise descriptive data of selected studies, that is, location of study, subpopulation of AAS users, the number of participants, number and gender of AAS users, and the number of AAS (nAAS) users who sought support from physicians. Risk of bias assessment The risk of bias was assessed in two stages.Initially, the quality and internal validity of studies were evaluated Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria Quantitative and qualitative studies with people using AAS for the purposes of image and performance enhancement.Studies with patients using AAS for the treatment of medical conditions.Studies with prisoners, who have limited access to external health services.Studies with animal subjects and in vitro analysis of AAS’ effects.Studies informing the no of AAS users seeking physicians to receive information and prevent and treat AAS- related health conditions.
Studies where the source of support or information can be understood as being a physician (eg, doctor, medical doctor, health professional).Studies not informing the no of AAS users in the sample who seek support from physicians. Studies where the contact with the physician cannot be understood as the participant’s choice, such as involuntary admissions, postmortem analysis and cohorts of patients selected for studies of specific health conditions.Peer- reviewed studies.Studies published at any time.Studies published in any language, as long as it is possible to retrieve relevant data from the authors or articles.‘Grey literature’ (non- peer- reviewed studies and reports).Case studies and interviews with a single AAS user.AAS, androgenic- anabolic steroids.3 Amaral JMX, et al.BMJ Open 2022;12:e056445.
doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056445Open access using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT).27 The MMAT is composed of five quality- assessment criteria : (1) Is the sampling strategy relevant to address the research question?; (2) Is the sample representative of the target population?; (3) Are the measurements appro- priate?; (4) Is the risk of nonresponse bias low? and (5) Is the statistical analysis appropriate to answer the research question?.For the purposes of this review, studies with more than two negative or unknown responses to MMAT’s assessment criteria were considered to have high risk of bias.In the second stage, studies were assessed for risk of publication bias.
The risk of publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of asymetry in a funnel plot,28 Egger’s test for asymmetry29 and a rank correlation test.30 Data synthesis The data synthesis for meta- analysis was performed extracting the nAAS users who reported seeking any kind of support from physicians in the selected studies. For the purpose of effect size calculations, the nAAS users in each study was used as the number of participants of interest, and the number of those who informed seeking a physi- cian was used as the number of cases in each study.When a study informed more than one number or percentage of AAS users seeking support from physicians, the higher value of male AAS users seeking medical support was considered, as only a few studies included female participants.A meta- analysis was performed to estimate the overall prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians.
A random- effects model was chosen to better incorporate the dispersions of prevalence rates across studies and the different approaches to the research question.31 Hetero- geneity was measured using the I2 index, which describes the percentage of variation of prevalence rates across a group of studies that is due to differences between studies (eg, different sample sizes, populations or methods).32 33 A Baujat plot was produced to identify studies that could influence the overall result.34 The secondary outcomes were measured by the prevalence rates of studies grouped by location and subpopulation of AAS users. Univariate and multivariate meta- regressions were performed to measure the impact of study level moder - ators on the prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians.
Based on the variables used by Sagoe et al,35 four moderators were hypothesised to have an impact on the prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians (location of studies, subpopulation of AAS users, time of publication and study design). Addi- tionally, two other moderators commonly used in prev- alence studies36 37 were included post hoc (sample size and risk of bias).The selection and coding of modera- tors followed consensus procedures.The time of publi- cation was categorised as before and after the year 2000, as we hypothesised that the availability of the internet and on- line support communities of AAS users16—could impact the prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians.Risk of bias was categorised according to the number of negative or unknown responses to MMAT’s assessment criteria.27 For each moderator variable, the category with the highest number of studies was used as reference, and dummy variables were automatically generated.
Statistically significant (p<0.05) variables were entered into a multivariable model. The meta- analysis and meta- regression were conducted in R38 using the metaphor package.39 A full description of the codes and a dataset with the coded variables can be found in online supplemental material.Patient and public involvement It was not appropriate to involve patients or the public in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans of this study.RESULTS The searches identified 11 906 studies.After the removal of duplicates, 9876 studies were screened by title and abstract.Among 285 full- text studies were assessed for eligibility, 31 were included in the review.A supplemen- tary search on the reference list of included papers and previous reviews led to the inclusion of another five studies.A total of 36 studies were included in the review, as shown in the flow chart of figure 1.Figure 1 Flow chart of the inclusion of studies in the review.4 Amaral JMX, et al.

A large proportion of studies with adolescents (three out of four) and strength athletes (four out of nine) were located in the USA, followed by a single study from different countries. The two studies with NSP clients were located either in the UK or Australia.All the five transregional studies were conducted with a non- specific subpopulation of AAS users.Risk of bias According to the MMAT quality criteria, only seven (19.44%) studies did not present a risk of bias.The following number of studies had a negative or unknown response to MMAT assessment: Inappropriate or unclear sampling strategy (n=0); sample representativeness low or unclear (n=10; 27.78%); inappropriate or unclear measurements (n=14; 38.89%); high or unclear risk of nonresponse bias (n=19; 52.77%) and inappropriate or unclear statistical analysis (n=2; 5.56%).
The main cause of inappropriate or unclear measurements in some studies was the fact that the nAAS seeking support from physicians was not clearly stated, requiring an extrapola- tion from the total number of participants. Ultimately, 12 studies (33.33%) were considered to have a high risk of bias (2 or more negative or unknown response to MMAT criteria).A full assessment of risk of bias can be found in online supplemental material etable 2.There was no evidence of publication bias, as indicated by visual inspec- tion of the funnel plot (figure 2), Egger’s test for asym- metry (bias coefficient=0.937, p=0.349, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.45), and a rank correlation test (τ=−0.086, p=0.4731).Meta-analysis of the overall prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians The overall prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians obtained from 36 studies is 37.12% (95% CI 27.71% to 44.52%).
The smallest prevalence rate (1.76%; 95% CI 0.61% to 2.91%; nAAS=512) was observed in a study with gym users in Pakistan.40 The highest prevalence rate (88.76%, 95% CI 77.46% to 100.06%; nAAS=267) was reported in a study with non- specific AAS users in Australia.41 Figure 3 shows a forest plot of prevalence rates, ordered by the effect sizes of all studies. Meta-analysis of prevalence rates of studies grouped by location When grouped by the location of studies, the highest prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians was seen among studies taking place in Australia (67.27%; 95% CI 47.29% to 87.25%), followed by trans- regional studies (51.48%; 95% CI 35.26% to 67.71%).The lowest prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians was seen in studies located in Africa, Asia or Middle East (21.02%; 95% CI 5.26% to 36.79%).A forest plot of the prevalence rates of studies grouped by location is shown in figure 4.
Meta-analysis of prevalence rates of studies grouped by subpopulation of AAS users The highest prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians was seen among studies with NSP clients (54.13%; 95% CI 36.41% to 71.84%), followed by studies with non- specific AAS users (41.67%; 95% CI 31.23% to 52.12%) and studies with strength athletes (27.83%; 95% CI 17.97% to 37.69%). The lowest prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians was seen in studies with adolescents (17.27%; 95% CI 4.80% to 29.74%).A forest plot of the prevalence rates of studies grouped by subpopulation of AAS users is shown in figure 5.Meta-regression exploring the variability in the prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians The results of the meta- regression analyses are shown in table 3.
Univariable analyses showed that the prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians was signifi- cantly higher among studies located in Australia (β =0.35, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.58, p=0.005) and in studies utilising an online survey for data collection (β =0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.34, p=0.014). These two variables were therefore eligible for inclusion in the multivariable regression analysis.An overall multivariable model with the vari- ables was statistically significant (χ2 (8)=20.25, p=0.009).Only studies located in Australia (β =0.33, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.57, p=0.007) remained a significant predictor of the prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physi- cians, suggesting that the prevalence of this behaviour is higher in Australia compared with other studies’ locations.Figure 2 Funnel plot of studies included in the analysis with pseudo 95% CI.6 Amaral JMX, et al.BMJ Open 2022;12:e056445.
doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056445Open access DISCUSSION We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis and pooled data from 36 studies to estimate that the overall prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians is 37.12%. Higher prevalence rates of AAS users seeking support from physicians were seen among studies located in Australia (67.27%) and studies with NSP clients (54.13%).Lower prevalence rates were seen among studies located in Africa, Asia or the Middle East (21.02%) and studies with adolescents (17.27%).
One of the general factors possibly influencing the prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians is the fact that men, who represent the majority of AAS users,35 are generally less likely to seek medical support42 —a tendency corroborated by the only two studies comparing the prevalence of male and female AAS users seeking support from physicians.19 43 Other potential factors include the legal status of AAS use,9 the engagement of AAS users with health services,8 AAS users’ perceptions of the service provided by physicians7 24 44 and the stigma experienced by AAS users.13 15 45 Our findings suggest that the legal status of AAS use is not always associated with AAS users’ engage- ment with physicians’ support. For example, studies located in Australia—where the possession of AAS is illegal46—showed the highest pooled prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians (51.13%).
Besides, the estimated prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians in the US (32.91%)—where the posses- sion of AAS is considered a federal crime47—was similar to the estimated prevalence in the UK (31.43%) and Brazil (35.23%), where the use and possession of AAS are not illegal.48 49 Likewise, a low prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians was seen in studies from countries in Africa, Asia or the Middle East (21.02%), where anecdotal reports suggest loose enforcement of the prohibition of AAS use50–53 or, in the case of India, where there are no laws regulating the use and commerce of AAS.54 Two studies from German showed prevalence rates of AAS users seeking support from physicians of 37.97%55 and 55.95%,56 while a single study from Poland reported a prevalence of 11.11%,57 despite the use of AAS not being illegal in both countries—unless, in the case of Germany, if AAS are used for the purpose of doping in sport competitions.58 59 Nevertheless, the legal status of AAS use could have influenced the small prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians (8.70%) seen in a single study from Denmark, where the use of AAS is not only illegal but where gym users can be subject to urinalysis to screen for the use of AAS.60 Therefore, it is Figure 3 Forest plot of the pooled prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians.

Although data from Australia was based on a small number of studies, results of the multivariate meta- regression analysis showed that the prevalence rate of studies published in Australia was the only variable with a statistically significant impact on the overall prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians estimated by this study.The engagement of AAS users with health services could have influenced the comparatively high prevalence (54.13%) of AAS users seeking support from physicians seen among clients of the NSP—namely those assessing NSP services that provide information about injection practices and adverse effects of AAS.23 62 Among NSP clients, those seeking support from physicians are more likely to have diagnostic screening for health conditions potentially associated with the use of AAS—despite some NSP clients considering physicians a less reliable source of information about AAS than NSP workers.62 Despite the growing numbers of AAS users seeking the NSP, only a minority of primary NSP units offer specialised advice Figure 5 Forest plot of prevalence rates of studies, grouped by subpopulation of AAS users.
AAS, androgenic- anabolic steroids; NSP , needle and syringe exchange programme 9 Amaral JMX, et al. BMJ Open 2022;12:e056445.doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056445Open access about AAS.63 Besides, the majority of people using inject- able drugs access the NSP via retail pharmacies, where the services are frequently limited to the exchange of injectable material.64 The lower pooled prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians was seen among adolescents (17.27%).Although low rates of engagement with health services are seen among adolescents in general,65 some factors could have influenced an even lower prevalence of adolescent AAS users seeking support from physicians.First, the prevalence of some health conditions poten- tially associated with the use of AAS—such as cardiovas- cular disease66—is lower among adolescents.Second, it is possible that the illegality of AAS use has deterred adoles- cents from seeking physicians more than other subpopu- lations of AAS users.
As observed by Terney and McLain,67 physicians were allowed to prescribe AAS for enhance- ment purposes in the US until 1988 and were frequently reported as a source of AAS to adolescents.67–69 As near all of the selected studies with adolescents were located in the US, it is possible that the criminalisation of AAS use has driven adolescent AAS users further away from seeking the support of physicians. Among strength athletes who use AAS, we estimated a prevalence of seeking support from physicians of 27.83%.
Strength athletes who use AAS have been described as having a perception that the use of AAS can be safely managed, namely with the support of other AAS users who share their objectives, training routines and lifestyles.20 22 The self- research and trial- and- error experiences with AAS, combined with aesthetical and performance goals frequently considered exaggerated by Table 3 Univariable and multivariable predictors of the prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians (N=36) Variable NUnivariable Multivariable Regression coefficient (95% CI) SE Regression coefficient (95% CI) SE Location USA 8 1 – 1 – UK 5 −0.01 (−0.23 to 0.21) 0.11 −0.02 (−0.24 to 0.21) 0.12 Continental Europe 6 −0.05 (−0.26 to 0.16) 0.11 −0.02 (−0.24 to 0.19) 0.11 Australia 4 0.35 (0.11 to 0.58)* 0.12 0.33 (0.09 to 0.57)* 0.12 Brazil 3 0.02 (−0.24 to 0.29) 0.14 0.07 (−0.20 to 0.34) 0.14 Africa, Asia or Middle East 5 −0.12 (−0.34 to 0.11) 0.12 −0.07 (−0.30 to 0.17) 0.12 Transregional 5 0.19 (−0.03 to 0.40) 0.11 0.11 (−0.17 to 0.38) 0.14 Subpopulation Non- specific AAS users 21 1 – Adolescents 4 −0.23 (−0.47 to 0.01) 0.12 Strength athletes 9 −0.12 (−0.29 to 0.05) 0.09 NSP clients 2 0.13 (−0.18 to 0.43) 0.15 Sample size Small (<100) 18 1 – Medium (>100, <1000) 16 0.12 (−0.03 to 0.27) 0.76 Large (>1000) 2 0.25 (−0.06 to 0.55) 0.16 Time of publication 2005–2021 26 1 – 1988–1999 10 −0.13 (−0.29 to 0.03) 0.08 Study design Questionnaire 33 1 – 1 – Interview 3 0.24 (−0.04 to 0.52) 0.14 0.14 (−0.14 to 0.42) 0.14 Online survey 9 0.19 (0.04 to 0.34)† 0.08 0.13 (−0.07 to 0.33) 0.10 Risk of bias Low (<2) 24 1 – High (≥2) 12 −0.41 (−0.20 to 0.12) 0.08 *P<0.01 †P<0.05.
AAS, androgenic- anabolic steroids; NSP , needle and syringe exchange programme. 10 Amaral JMX, et al.BMJ Open 2022;12:e056445.doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056445Open access people outside of the community of strength athletes70 probably contribute to the perception that physicians are less knowledgeable about AAS than some members of this subpopulation.Furthermore, it is possible that some strength athletes are even more subject to stigma than other AAS users, due to their unusually muscular physiques or to a prejudice towards bodybuilding and other strength- related disciplines.71 Regarding the kind of support sought by AAS users from physicians among the 36 selected studies, 16 (44.44%) reported that AAS users sought physicians as a source of information about the use and adverse effects of AAS.
The remaining studies described AAS users’ contact with physicians in many different ways, such as having close contact with physicians,56 seeking a doctor for interpre- tation of health checks,13 and disclosing the use of AAS to a physician.7 72 We considered that further exploration of the types of support sought by AAS users would lie beyond the scope of this study, as they have been recently investigated by other reviews.17 73 74 Limitations of this study The prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physi- cians varied widely across the selected studies, and this variation was only minimally explained by the meta- regression and the comparisons between subgroups of studies. Furthermore, the selected studies investigated and described the help- seeking behaviours of AAS users in many different ways that were synthesised as a single variable for the purpose of comparison.The pooled prev- alence in different locations was based on a limited sample of highly heterogenic studies.
For instance, the estimated prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians from Australia was based on only four studies—three with a non- specific population of AAS users and one with NSP clients—comprising 10.22% of the total nAAS users from selected studies. This review did not distinguish data from male and female AAS users, as the sex of participants or differences in help- seeking behaviour between male and female participants were not reported by the majority of studies.The review only included studies from a few countries and, among those, many contributed with a single study unable to represent the local population of AAS users.As discussed in this review, the engagement of AAS users with physicians can be influenced by several factors, including attitudes that can vary widely between locations and subpopulations of AAS users.
These limita- tions can compromise the generalisation of our results, and further studies are necessary to better understand the help- seeking behaviours of AAS users, namely among understudied locations and subpopulations of AAS users. Implications for practice and policy Available data suggest that factors such as the criminali- sation of AAS use, the scarcity of physicians’ knowledge about AAS and stigma against AAS users are barriers to the access of some AAS users to physicians.The results of this review can indicate locations and subpopulations of AAS users with higher engagement with physicians, so successful strategies can be replicated.Likewise, our results indicate the existence of under- studied and possibly undersupported populations of AAS users.CONCLUSION This meta- analysis was the first to systematically investigate the prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians.
Our findings suggest that the overall prevalence of AAS users seeking support from physicians is 37.12%, with considerable variation across locations and among subpopulations of AAS users. This study highlights the importance of understanding the help- seeking behaviours of AAS users and improving their access to physicians.Twitter Julio Mario Xerfan Amaral @JulioAmaral21 Acknowledgements We thank the participants and authors of the selected studies, the developers of R and the mefator package, and the reviewers of this journal for their valuable comments.Contributors JMXA planned the study and conducted the meta- analysis.JMXA and AK conducted the selection of studies and the assessment of the risk of bias.AK and PD contributed to the interpretation of data.JMXA, AK and PD reviewed and approved the final draft.JMXA accepts full responsibility for the finished work and/ or the conduct of the study, had access to the data, and controlled the decision to publish.
