Abstract Microbial infections of bones, particularly after joint replacement surgery, are a common occurrence in clinical settings and often lead to osteomyelitis (OM).
Unfortunately, current treatment approaches for OM are not satisfactory. To address this issue, this study focuses on the development and evaluation of an in- jectable magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticle (NP)-coordinated phosphocreatine-grafted chitosan hydrogel (CMPMg-VCM) loaded with varying amounts of vancomycin (VCM) for the treat - ment of OM.The results demonstrate that the loading of VCM does not affect the formation of the injectable hydrogel, and the MgO-incorporated hydrogel exhibits anti-swelling properties.The release of VCM from the hydrogel effectively kills S.aureus bacteria, with CMPMg-VCM (50) showing the highest antibacterial activity even after prolonged immersion in PBS solution for 12days.Importantly, all the hydrogels are non-toxic to MC3T3-E1 cells and promote osteogenic differentiation through the early se- cretion of alkaline phosphatase and calcium nodule formation.
Furthermore, in vivo experiments using a rat OM model reveal that the CMPMg-VCM hydrogel effectively kills and inhibits bacterial growth, while also protecting the infected bone from osteolysis. These beneficial properties are attributed to the burst release of VCM, which disrupts bacterial biofilm, as well as the release of Mg ions and hydroxyl by the degradation of MgO NPs, which inhibits bacterial growth and prevents osteolysis.Overall, the CMPMg-VCM hydrogel exhibits promising potential for the treatment of microbial bone infections.Keywords: injectable chitosan hydrogel; vancomycin loading and release; antibacterials property; osteogenic promotive property; osteomyelitis treatment Introduction Osteomyelitis (OM), usually caused by microbial infection in bones, is common in clinics, such as after surgical instrument implantation.The pathogenic bacteria for OM are Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus).
In opening orthopaedic trauma, more than 20% of patients will suffer from OM, which leads to osteolysis, bone destruction and sequestrum formation [1]. The clinic treatment method for OM is multiple surgical debridement and long-term and high-dose use of antibiotics in local sites or systemic admin - istration [2], but they suffer from inefficiency, high cost, high re- currence and morbidity and/or even serious bacterial resistance.One of the standard methods in clinics is to use antibiotic-loaded poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement for the local release of drugs against OM, but suffer from limited antibiotic drug loading and releasing, an unamiable polymerization environment for drugs, and a second surgery to remove the non- biodegradable PMMA [3].
In the last decades, with the develop - ment of biomaterials and regenerative medicine, newly designed biomaterials with outstanding anti-bacterial, biodegradability and osteogenic promotive properties should be an alternative way to circumvent these issues. In the OM treatment, the most important attribute of bioma - terials should be their excellent bactericidal property in the ini- tial stage to break the bacterial film formed by OM, and in the long-term implantation process, the biomaterials should also possess the antibacterial property to inhibit the growth and Received: January 23, 2024.Revised: April 03, 2024.Accepted: April 22, 2024 # The Author(s) 2024.Published by Oxford University Press.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Meanwhile, the other properties are also important to the OM treatment.To this end, various kinds of biomaterials loaded (or not) with different antimicrobial agents or antibiotics have been designed and developed to address the challenges during the OM treatment.The reported biomaterials included biodegradable metals [4], natural antimicrobial peptides-based biomaterials [5], biodegradable polymers [6], chi- tosan (CS) [7], hydrogels [8], nanoparticles (NPs) [9], nanohydrox - yapatite/collagen granules [10], gelatin microspheres [11] and others.Among these options, hydrogels, especially those made from natural polymers, have shown great promise in OM treat - ment as essential attributes in biocompatibility, biodegradability, antibacterial drug loading and controlled release.
CS, a kind of natural polymer, is extracted from the shells of crustaceans and possesses the desirable properties in biodegradability, biocom - patibility and antimicrobial properties. CS and CS derivates have been largely used as matrix materials for bone regeneration [12] and drug loading and release carrier materials [13].However, the insoluble nature of CS limits its further biomedical applications.Numerous CS derivates have been developed, such as carboxy - methyl CS [7], methacryloyl CS [14] and phosphate CS [12], for tis- sue regeneration as the water-soluble attribute of these CS derivates.The antibacterial mechanism of CS is that the abun - dant positive charged amino groups in the CS backbone can elec- trostatically combine with negatively charged bacteria, and then the CS accumulates on the wall, followed by destruction of the bacterial membrane, which then results in the death of bacteria.
Grafting with other molecules in CS would consume the amino groups, which compromises the antibacterial efficacy of CS. The intrinsic antibacterial properties of CS, especially its derivates, are far from satisfactory in OM treatment.Therefore, loading and controlled release of antibiotic agents for CS-based hydrogels is of importance for OM treatment.To our best knowledge, almost no study has been reported to endow the dynamically varying antibacterial properties and the osteogenic promotive properties.Magnesium oxide (MgO) NPs are a kind of important magnesium-contained compound that can be degraded in a physiological environment or chloride-contained aqueous solu- tion to produce magnesium ions and hydroxyl ions.Previous studies confirmed that Mg ions combined with hydroxyl ions pos- sessed antibacterial properties [15], and Mg ions in suitable con- centrations have osteogenic promotive properties [16], especially in the alkalescent environment [17].
Recent studies have been reported to incorporate MgO NPs into CS-based hydrogel systems [12], polymeric scaffolds [18, 19] and other composite scaffolds [20] to improve the mechanical properties and angiogenic and os- teogenic promotive properties. Our previous study verified that the MgO NPs can combine with phosphate groups in phosphocreatine-grafted CS to form injectable hydrogel via metal-organic coordination [12], and in this study, the osteogenic and angiogenic properties of this hydrogel have been investigated and confirmed.However, the antibacterial properties of this hy- drogel may need to be greatly improved, especially in the OM treatment.Vancomycin (VCM), as a kind of glycopeptide antibi - otic, has antibacterial ability against gram-positive bacteria, such as SA, via interfering with the production of bacterial cell walls [21].VCM has been utilized for OM treatment in clinics via local and systemic administration methods.
However, local delivery of high-concentration VCM will restrain bone growth and easily cause bone loss at the local site, which requires multiple local drug deliveries. Therefore, the design and development of a bio- material system to load and control the release of VCM will be desirable for OM treatment.Herein, the water-soluble VCM was directly mixed into a phosphocreatine-grafted CS solution, and then MgO NPs were added to this mix solution to form the VCM-loaded magnesium- phosphate coordinated hydrogel (CMPMg-VCM).The burst re- lease of VCM in the initial stage will break the bacterial film, and in the long-term implantation process, the controlled release of magnesium ions and hydroxyl groups will promote new bone growth and inhibit the propagation of bacteria.
The physico - chemical properties, including rheological property, anti- swelling property, compressive property, antibacterials property to SA, cytotoxicity to MC3T3-E1 cells and in vitro osteogenic pro- motive property to MC3T3-E1 cells, were systematically investi - gated. Finally, the rat tibia OM model was created by injecting a large amount of S.aureus into the medullary cavity, and then the hydrogels were implanted into the medullary cavity to investi - gate the OM treatment efficacy and in vivo osteogenic promo - tive properties.Materials and methods The synthesis of phosphate-functionalized methacryloyl chitosan (CMP) We synthesized the phosphocreatine (PS, C104990, Aladdin, Shanghai, China) functionalized methacryloyl CM polymer according to the protocol in the previous study [12].
Specifically, 1g CS (CS, 448869, Sigma, USA) was dissolved in 100ml of 1% ace- tate (A116166, Aladdin, Shanghai, China) water solution, and then 1.1ml of methacrylic anhydride (MA, 276685, Sigma, USA) was gently added to this solution. After stirring at room tempera - ture for at least 12h, the 100ml reacted CS solution was slowly added into 50ml of 2.7g PS mixed with 0.9g of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dime - thylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC, 03450, Sigma, USA) and 0.3g N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS, 56480, Sigma, USA) solution.After 24h of stirring at room temperature, the reacted solution was dialyzed in DI water for 7days and then lyophilized to obtain the flocculent-like CMP.Hydrogel fabrication We purchased Vancomycin HCl (VCM) from MeilunBio (contain - ing approximately 900g/mg, MB1260, Dalian, China).MgO NPs (the average diameter was ca.20nm according to the vendor) were purchased from XFNANO (100369, Nanjing, China).
The synthesized CMP polymer was dissolved in DI water at a concen - tration of 20mg/ml. Then, different amounts of VCM were added to a 5-ml CSMP solution to make different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5mg/mL) of VCM-contained solutions, followed by add- ing 50μl of 10mg MgO nanoparticle water solution to this solu- tion.As VCM was water-soluble and could be entirely added to the pre-gel solution, the loading capacity was the dissolution limit of VCM in this pre-gel solution in theory.After being mixed well, the VCM-incorporated injectable hydrogels were formed.The different concentrations of VCM-incorporated hydrogels were named CMPMg-VCM (1, 5, 10 and 50), and the sole MgO- incorporated injectable hydrogel without VCM was named CMPMg.The chemical hydrogel without MgO nanoparticles and VCM was synthesized with the method described in the reported study [14].
Characterization The hydrogels were lyophilized, and after being gold sprayed, the surface morphology was observed with scanning electron mi- croscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM-7401F, Tokyo, Japan), and the elemen - tal distribution was detected with the energy-dispersive 2 | Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol. 11, rbae049 spectrometer (EDS) equipped in the SEM.We measured the rheo - logical properties of hydrogels using a rheometer (ESCALAB, 250Xi).The disc sample (20mm in diameter and 1mm in height) was placed on the testing plate, and then a time sweep was per- formed with a strain of 10%, and the frequency ranged from 0.1 to 10Hz.The swelling ratio of hydrogels was performed by immersing the hydrogels in DI water solution.The cylindrical hydrogel sam- ples (8mm in diameter and 10mm in height) were immersed in DI water, and after swelling in DI water for 24h the samples were taken out and imaged with a digital camera.
Meanwhile, we mea - sured the diameter and height of the swollen hydrogels using a vernier caliper and calculated the volume as V1. The volume change ratio was calculated with the following formula: V1/V0 × 100%, the V0 was calculated before the immersion.Four parallel samples were performed for statistical analysis.We tested the compression property of hydrogels using a ma- terial testing machine (Instron-E3000, Norwood, MA).We per- formed the compression testing on a cylindrical hydrogel sample (8mm in diameter and 10mm in height).The compression speed was 5mm/min.Each group received four parallel samples.We obtained the compressive strength and modulus from the com- pressive strain vs.stress curves.A cylindrical hydrogel with 8mm in diameter and 10mm in height was immersed in a 3ml PBS solution in an air bath with the rocking state at 37�C.
At the set time point, all the immersed solution was collected to detect the VCM concentration with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AA-7003, EWAI, Beijing, China), and a new 3-ml PBS solution was added to each sample. We obtained the accumulated VCM release curves for each sam- ple.After immersion, the accumulated release ratio of VCM was calculated according to the following formula: M1/M0 × 100%, the M1 was the quality of the accumulated released VCM, and the M0 was the quality of the loaded VCM.The quality of the loaded VCM was calculated from the added VCM concentration and the volume of the immersed hydrogel.For the magnesium ion re- lease assay, a cylindrical hydrogel sample (8mm in diameter and 6mm in height) was immersed in a 3-ml PBS solution in an air bath with the rocking state at 37�C.
At the set time point, the im- mersed PBS solution was collected to detect the magnesium ion concentration with the same atomic absorption spectrophotome - ter, and the newly prepared 3ml PBS solution was added. Finally, the magnesium ion release curves were obtained.We conducted this investigation on four parallel samples.Antibacterial properties of hydrogels Staphylococcus aureus (CMCC(B)26003, HuanKai Microbial, Guangzhou, China) was cultured in soy casein culture medium (HuanKai Microbial) at 37�C in the rocking state.After the optical density (O.D.) of the medium reached 0.5, the bacterial medium solution was used for further antibacterial property testing investigations.The bacterial medium solution was carefully and uniformly coated on an agar culture dish, and then the sterilized lyophilized hydrogel samples were placed on the culture dish.The dish was cultured in an incubator at 37�C with 5% CO2 for 24h.
After that, the images for each dish were taken, and the diameter of the in- hibitory zone in each sample was measured with a vernier cali- per. Three parallel samples for each group were performed for statistical analysis, and the representative images were used for display.One sterilized lyophilized hydrogel sample (8mm in diameter and 10mm in height) was immersed in 3ml of PBS and then placed in an air bath shaker at 37�C with a shaking rate of 100rpm.At each set time point (days 3, 6, 9 and 12), half of the immersed PBS (1.5ml) solution was taken out of each sample for antibacterial property testing, and 1.5ml of fresh PBS was added to each sample for further immersion.About 1.5ml of the sam- ples’ immersed PBS solution was mixed with 1.5ml of the bacte - rial medium solution (the same as the aforementioned), and then this mixed solution was cultured in an air bath shaker at 37�C with a shaking rate of 100rpm for 24h.After that, 1ml of this mixed solution was taken for O.D.
detection at 600nm; 1ml of the mixed solution was carefully and uniformly coated on an agar culture dish and after 24h of culture in an incubator (37�C, 5% CO2), the images for each dish were taken. In vitro cell culture study We used the murine calvaria pre-osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1, ATCC CRL-2594, USA) to assess the cell viability and osteogenic promotive properties for the samples.MC3T3-E1 cells were cul- tured in minimum essential medium alpha (α-MEM, Hyclone, USA), including 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.We ly- ophilized the cylindrical hydrogel samples (8mm in diameter and 1.5mm in height) and sterilized them under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation for 1h before using them for cell study.About 1ml of cell suspension solution with 5×103 cells was seeded into a well in a 24-well plate, and after 24h of culture, the sterilized lyophilized hydrogel sample was placed in the chamber in a transwell, which was placed onto each well.Every three days, we refreshed the medium.
For the live/dead cells assay, af- ter 3 and 5 days of culture, the medium was removed from each well, and the live/dead cells were stained with the live/dead staining kit (Calcein-AM/PI double stain kit, Shanghai, China) according to the instructions. After staining, the cells were ob- served using fluorescence microscopy (OLYMPUS-IX51, Japan).For cell viability assay, after 3- and 5-days culture, the medium was removed from each well, and 300 μl of medium containing 10% cell counting kit-8 solution (CCK-8, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added to each well.After incubating in a cell culture incubator for 1h, 200 μl of solution from each well was carefully transferred to a new 96-well plate, and then the O.D.was detected at 450nm using a microplate reader.The cell viability was calculated according to the following: [(As − Ab)/(A c − Ab)] × 100%, where As was the O.D.of tested samples, Ab and Ac were the O.D.of the positive and negative control.
For the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and alizarin red as- say, 1ml of cell suspension with 5×104 cells was seeded into a well in a 24-well plate. After 24h of culture, the sterilized lyophi - lized hydrogel sample was placed in the chamber in a transwell, which was placed onto each well, and the medium was changed to osteogenic promoting medium, which contained β-glycero - phosphate (1mol l−1; Sigma, USA), ascorbate acid (50mmol l−1; Sigma, USA), and dexamethasone (1mmol l−1; Sigma, USA).Every three days, we refreshed the medium.After 7- and 14-day cultures, the medium was removed, and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde.After being washed with PBS three times, the cells were stained with the BCIP/NBT alkaline phosphatase kit (Beyotime, China) according to the instructions of the kit.For the ALP activity assessment, after 7- and 14-day culture, the me- dium was removed, and the cells were lysed with 1% Triton.
The cell lysate was used for the ALP activity assay using an alkaline phosphatase kit (Nanjing Jiancheng, China) according to the instructions of the kit. We used a bicinchoninic acid protein as- say kit (BCA, Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing) to de- tect the protein concentration.We obtained the ALP activity Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol.11, rbae049 | 3 using the alkaline phosphatase kit.For the alizarin red assay, af- ter 21days of culture, the medium was removed and the cells were rinsed with PBS three times.Then, 200 μl of alizarin red staining (ARS) solution (Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing) was added to each well, and after 20min of incubation at room temperature, the ARS solution was removed.The cells were rinsed with deionized water several times until no stained solution was observed.The cells were imaged with optical mi- croscopy (MM6, Leitz Company).
For the quantitative analysis, the stained dye was dissolved with 10% hexadecylpridinium chloride (Sigma, USA), and the O.D. of the solution was detected at 562nm.For the cell culture study, four parallel samples were performed for statistical analysis.In vivo study We purchased the female Sprague Dawley rats, weighing approx - imately 220g, from the Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center in Guangzhou, China.All the surgical procedures were followed the instructions approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University Shenzhen Hospital (ethical approval No.2022-164).The rats were separated into five groups, and each group had six rats.After anaesthesia with iso- flurane, the hair around the knee was shaved.Then, the skin and the muscle around the lateral patella were cut and separated, and the tubercle of the tibia was exposed.Then, a hole (1mm in diameter) was made in the tubercle of the tibia using a dental drill.
About 10μl 1×108 CFU/ml bacterial suspension (in PBS so- lution) was added into the tibial medullary cavity, followed by the implantation of different samples. The implanted hydrogel samples were CMP, CMPMg and CMPMg-VCM (50), and the CMPMg-VCM (50) was shorted as CMPMg-VCM in the main fig- ures display.The negative control was injected with a bacterial suspension, and the positive control was implanted with a steril - ized PBS solution.Subsequently, we sealed the hole with bone wax, layer by layer, covering the wound.After 3- and 6-week im- plantation, the rats were euthanasiad, and the tibia was obtained Figure 1.Preparation and rheological properties of injectable hydrogels.(A) Gelation process of CMPMg-VCM hydrogel versus CMPMg hydrogel.(B) Frequency sweeping of viscous moduli G00and elastic moduli G0of CMPMg-VCM hydrogel versus CMPMg hydrogel from 0.1 to 100Hz under 1% stain at 37�C.(C) Representative compressive stress vs.

The region of interest (ROI) for bone-related parameter analysis was 100 scanning surfaces, which are from the bone scale line to the dis- tal tibia. The bone-related parameters include bone mineral den- sity, the ratio of bone volume to tissue volume and trabecular numbers.The fixed tibias were immersed in a 10% EDTA solution for two months to undergo decalcification.Then, the tibias were em- bedded in paraffin, and cross sections of tibia were cut at 5μm in thickness for haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson staining and Gram’s staining according to the instructions.We evaluated the semi-quantitative histological scoring analysis for the inflam - mation in H&E staining from the reported studies [22, 23], sum - marizing and presenting the scores for capsule thickness, qualitative bone reaction, inflammatory response and ingrowth.The obtained organs were fixed with paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin for tissue section, followed by H&E staining.
Results Fabrication, rheological and compressive properties of CMPMg-VCM hydrogel Figure 1A shows the tube inversion test to investigate the fabrica - tion of CMPMg-VCM hydrogel. The phosphocreatine-grafted CS with or without VCM would form a hydrogel after the addition of MgO nanoparticles.From the rheological property result in Figure 1B, all the injectable hydrogels, including CMPMg, CMPMg- VCM (1, 5, 10 and 50), have a higher elastic moduli G0than that of chemically crosslinked CMP hydrogel.All the injectable hydro - gels had similar elastic moduli G0, indicating the inclusion of VCM in the hydrogel would not weaken the hydrogel.The com- pressive property results of hydrogels are presented in Figure 1C.The CMPMg-VCM (10 and 50) hydrogel had a higher compressive strength than those of CMP and CMPMg hydrogels.Anti-swelling property of hydrogels Figure 2 shows the anti-swelling properties of hydrogels im- mersed in DI water.
From the macroscopical images in Figure 2A, all the injectable hydrogels showed no obvious change between Figure 2. Anti-swelling properties of hydrogels when immersed in DI water.(A) The macroscopical images for the hydrogels, and (B) the volume change ratio of hydrogels before and after swollen in DI water for 24h (n¼4, �P<0.05).Figure 3.Surface SEM images and surface EDS mapping for the lyophilized hydrogels.Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol.11, rbae049 | 5 before and after swelling in DI water.The statistical analysis re- sult for the volume change ratio in Figure 2B showed the same tendency with macroscopical observation.Surface morphology and EDS analysis Figure 3 presents the surface morphology and EDS results for the lyophilized hydrogels.All the CMPMg samples showed porous- like morphology; the pore size was around 100–150 μm, and the same small holes were displayed in the thin pore walls.
The chemical bond CMP hydrogel also presented a porous-like mor- phology, but no small holes were observed in the pore walls. In the EDS results, the element Cl was from the VCM, and the element Mg was from MgO nanoparticles.As shown, all the VCM-loaded hydrogels showed the element Cl and all the MgO- incorporated hydrogels displayed the element Mg, indicating the existence of these components (VCM and MgO) in the CMPMg- VCM hydrogel.VCM and magnesium ions release profile Figure 4 shows the VCM and magnesium ions release profile of hydrogels when immersed in PBS.The VCM was released quickly from the hydrogels in the initial immersion stage (up to 3days), and then the remaining VCM in the hydrogel was slowly released for several days (9days in this study).The higher concentration of VCM in hydrogels released more VCM.We calculated the accu - mulated release ratio of VCM for CMPMg-VCM (1, 5, 10 and 50) as 75.7%, 79.1%, 89.5% and 91.0%, respectively, based on the re- leased curves.
More than 75% of the loaded VCM was released from the hydrogels after immersion. The magnesium ions release results for CMPMg and CMPMg-VCM (50) showed that magne - sium ions were released fast in the initial 4days of immersion and then slowly until 15days.In the middle immersion stage (from 3 to 12days), the magnesium ions release for CMPMg was larger than that of CMPMg-VCM (50), indicating the included VCM prohibited the magnesium ions release in this period, but after 15days of immersion, the released Mg ions amount for these hydrogels was similar.Antibacterial properties of hydrogels Staphylococcus aureus is the most prevalent infectious bacteria in OM.Thus, the antibacterial properties of hydrogels for SA were investigated, and the results are presented in Figures 5 and 6.
From Figure 5A, the bacteriostatic ring diameter for VCM-loaded hydrogels was larger than that of CMPMg and CMP hydrogels, and among these VCM-loaded hydrogels, the larger VCM-loaded hydrogel had a bigger bacteriostatic ring. The statistical analysis result in Figure 5B showed the same tendency for macroscopical observation as in Figure 5A.Further, to simulate the in vivo im- plantation environment, the antibacterial properties of PBS solu- tion after being immersed with hydrogels for different times were investigated.In Figure 6A, after 3days of immersion, no ob- vious bacterial colony was displayed on the VCM-loaded hydro - gels (CMPMg-VCM (1, 5, 10 and 50)) immersed solutions, and the CMP and CMPMg immersed solutions presented plenty of bacte - rial colonies.
With the immersion time up to 12days, the bacte - rial colony was gradually presented in low concentrations of VCM-loaded hydrogels (CMPMg-VCM (1, 5 and 10)) with increased immersion time, and the highest concentration of VCM-loaded hydrogel (CMPMg-VCM (50)) still showed no obvious bacterial col- ony after 12days of immersion. The statistical analysis results for the turbidity test in Figure 6B confirmed this tendency in Figure 6A.In vitro cell culture study The MC3T3-E1 cytotoxicity of hydrogels is shown in Figure 7.From the live/dead staining results in Figure 7A, all the hydrogel- cultured MC3T3-E1 cells showed some dead cells after being Figure 4.The accumulated VCM release for the hydrogels immersed in PBS solutions at 37±0.5�C in the rocking state.Figure 5.Antibacterial property of hydrogels to S.aureus.

From macroscopical images for ALP stain - ing results, at day 7, the CMPMg, CMPMg-VCM (1) and CMPMg- VCM (5) hydrogels showed a deeper black-brown stained colour when compared with other hydrogel samples and the control group; at day 14, all the MgO nanoparticles contained hydrogels that showed a deeper ALP-stained colour when compared with the CMP hydrogel and the control group. The ALP activity result in Figure 8B showed the same tendency with ALP staining obser - vation, and at day 14, the CMPMg, CMPMg-VCM (1) and CMPMg- VCM (5) showed the highest ALP activity among these samples.The alizarin red staining result for the MC3T3-E1 cells cultured with samples for 21days showed that all the MgO nanoparticles contained hydrogels and displayed a deeper red colour in com- parison with the CMP hydrogel and control group.The statistical analysis result in Figure 8C confirmed the calcium nodule- stained result tendency.
All the MgO nanoparticles that incorpo - rated hydrogels showed a higher quantity of stained alizarin red when compared with CMP hydrogel and the control group. In vivo animal study Bacterial culture assay and micro-CT result The in vivo antibacterial and osteolytic protective properties of hydrogels were investigated by implanting the hydrogels in the intramedullary space of the tibia bone in OM rats.After 6-week implantation, the obtained tibia was immersed in PBS solution, and these PBS solutions were used to perform the bacterial cul- ture experiment.From the bacterial culture result in Figure 9A, the CMPMg-VCM and CMPMg implanted groups showed few scat- tered bacterial colonies, which was lower than that of CMP and the negative control.Among these samples, the CMPMg-VCM showed the fewest bacterial colonies.The statistical analysis Figure 6.Turbidity assay for the S.aureus cultured with PBS solution immersed with hydrogels for 3, 6, 9 and 12days.

The CMPMg and CMP hydrogels presented the hole in the region of interest (ROI) area, especially the CMP hydrogel, which almost showed the same hole size with a negative group. The bone parameters in the ROI were analyzed from micro-CT data (in Figure 10B).The bone mineral density (BMD) for CMPMg-VCM was larger than that of the CMPMg, CMP and negative control groups after 3 and 6weeks of implantation.The ratio of bone volume to tissue volume and the trabecular numbers among these samples showed the same tendency as the BMD result.H&E, Masson and Gram’s staining The H&E staining (in Figure 11) results showed that at week 3, there were many bone destruction areas, such as cellular-like structure and laminar-like structure (as marked with a red ar- row) in the negative and CMP groups, but after implanting with the CMPMg and CMPMg-VCM groups, especially the CMPMg-VCM group, the bone destruction area decreased.
Meanwhile, the in- flammatory cell infiltration (blue dots) among these groups showed the same tendency for the bone destruction. At week 6, the bone destruction situation became worse for the negative and CMP groups; especially for the CMP group, most of the bone was destroyed, but the CMPMg-VCM group presented no obvious bone destruction or inflammatory cell infiltration.The Masson staining results in Figure 12 showed the same tendency as the Figure 7.Cytotoxicity of hydrogels when cultured with MC3T3-E1 cells.(A) Representative fluorescent images for live/dead cell when cultured with hydrogels for 3days, and (B) CCK8 results (n¼4).8 | Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol.11, rbae049 H&E staining results.There was severe bone damage for the neg- ative and CMP groups at these two time points, but the CMPMg- VCM group showed no obvious bone damage after 3 and 6weeks of implantation.
The semi-quantitative histological scoring for the inflammation in the H&E staining result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. In these four indexes, a high score means low inflammation.The score for CMPMg-VCM was higher than that of the CMP and negative control groups, indicating a low inflammatory reaction.Figure 13 showed the Gram’s staining results, and the bluish-violet-stained spheroid was the SA (marked as a red arrow).All the bacterially injected samples, in- cluding negative control, CMP, CMPMg and CMPMg-VCM, pre- sented a bluish-violet-stained spheroid after 3 weeks of implantation, and the CMPMg-VCM implanted group showed the least amount of stained spheroid.After 6weeks of implantation, the tendency among these samples was the same, but an obvious stained spheroid was presented in the CMPMg-VCM implanted group, which is similar to the positive control, indicating the ex- cellent antibacterial property of SA in vivo.
H&E staining for organs After 6weeks implantation, the organs, heart, live, spleen, lung and kidney were obtained for H&E staining to evaluate the bio- safety of CMPMg-VCM hydrogel in infected tibia and the result was showed in Supplementary Figure S2. The H&E staining result showed that these organs after implanted with CMPMg-VCM hydrogel displayed the same texture as the control group, indi- cating no bio-safety issue when implanted this CMPMg- VCM hydrogel.Figure 8.Osteogenic promotive property of hydrogels.(A) ALP and alizarin red staining images for the cells when cultured with different samples for 7, 14 and 21days, (B) ALP activity for the cells cultured with different samples for 7 and 14days and (C) alizarin red quantity for the staining (n¼4, �P<0.05).Figure 9.Bacterial culture assay for the tibia after samples were implanted for 6 weeks.

To be specific, the Mg(OH) 2 covered on the surface of MgO nanoparticles was combined with phos - phate groups in modified CS via metal-organic coordination, and when the added MgO NPs reached a certain concentration, the spatial network structure based on MgO NPs would be formed. The hydrogel formation condition is simple and mild, and the formation time could be controlled with the addition of MgO NPs.This hydrogel formation is quite different from the reported stud - ies [8].The included VCM could not affect the formation of hydrogel and could not affect the anti-swelling property of hydrogel in DI water.The low swelling ratio of MgO NPs incorporated into hydrogels might be attributed to that the magnesium hydroxide would combine with protonated amino groups, which would weaken the interaction between water and amino groups in hy- drogel, and therefore suppress penetration of water into the hy- drogel.
In this case, the addition of VCM to this hydrogel could not break the equilibrium state of the MgO NP-incorporated hy- drogel system. The low swelling ratio hydrogel has a low volume change ratio after being implanted in the local site, which would not oppress the surrounding tissue, and this is attractive in prac - tical clinical applications.Interestingly, the addition of VCM im- proved the compressive strength of hydrogel, especially the high amount of VCM (as shown in Figure 1).This might be attributed to that the existing groups, such as amino or hydroxyl groups in VCM, are physically combined with phosphate or other groups in Figure 10.The in vivo antibacterial and osteolysis protective property of hydrogels when implanted in the intramedullary space in tibia bone in the OM rat.(A) micro-CT data, and (B) the statistically analysis results for bone mineral density, bone volume vs.
tissue volume ratio and trabecular numbers in the OM area.10 | Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol. 11, rbae049 hydrogel, which enhance the hydrogel.As the water-soluble at- tribute of VCM and the weak physically combined VCM in this hydrogel system, the VCM was released fast in the initial stage during the in vitro immersion process (in Figure 4), and the re- lease of VCM was mainly dependent on the diffusion.Due to the high water content and micropore structure of hydrogels, PBS so- lution or other body fluid in the in vivo implantation process pen- etrated into the hydrogels, which eroded the MgO NPs.MgO could react with water to produce Mg(OH) 2, which reacts with chloride ions to produce Mg ions and hydroxyl ions, and along with the fluid exchange between hydrogel and surroundings, these ions were released from the hydrogel.The large amount of VCM release could kill the SA and further inhibit the SA colony’s reproduction, which is of importance in OM treatment in clinics.
During the OM treatment process, except for the large amount of VCM released in the initial stage to destroy the biofilm, the sub- sequent bacteriostatic effect was also important to inhibit the reoccurrence of biofilm. Therefore, the antibacterial property of PBS solution immersed with hydrogels for different times was performed (Figure 6); in this assay, at each time point, part of the immersed solution was used for the antibacterial efficacy test, which simulates the in vivo implanted microenvironment in which the released VCM would not metabolize so fast at the local site, and this experiment design is similar to the reported study Figure 11.H&E staining results for the infected area in the tibia bone after implanted hydrogels for 3 and 6weeks.The red arrow stands for bone destruction, including cellular-like and laminar-like structures; the yellow arrow stands for inflammatory cell infiltration.Figure 12.
Masson staining results for the infected area in the tibia bone after samples were implanted for 3 and 6weeks.Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol. 11, rbae049 | 11 [25].The excellent antibacterial efficacy of CMPMg-VCM (50) after 12days of immersion in PBS might be due to that the remaining VCM in the PBS solution would inhibit the release of VCM from the hydrogel, which is different from the VCM release profile in Figure 4, and the released Mg ions and hydroxyl groups produced by the MgO degradation also have bacteriostatic ability.The CMPMg-VCM hydrogels showed no obvious cytotoxicity to MC3T3-E1 cells and promoted osteogenic differentiation in this cell line, confirming the osteogenic promotive property of this hydrogel system.Only CMPMg and CMPMg-VCM (50) showed <75% cell viability at 3days of culture, which might be attributed to the high Mg ions concentration and the released VCM.
Additionally, this hydrogel showed no bio-safety issue when implanted in infected tibia for 6weeks (Supplementary Figure S2). No/low cytotoxicity to MC3T3-E1 and no bio-safety is- sue in the animal study were due to that the released compo - nents, including VCM, Mg ions and hydroxyl groups, were in the safe concentration range.The osteogenic promotive property of CMPMg-VCM hydrogel was attributed to the released magne - sium ions and alkalescent environment resulting from the MgO degradation, and the released VCM would not affect this pro- cess.According to the reported studies [26], the effective con- centration of magnesium ions to promote osteogenic differentiation was around 5mM.Many studies have confirmed the osteogenic promotive property of a suitable concentration of magnesium ions, especially in alkalescent surroundings [27, 28], and the osteogenic promoting mechanism for Mg ions was mainly through Wnt/β-catenin, MAPK and PI3K signaling path - ways.
Further, the hydrogel was implanted in the SA-infected intramedullary space of the tibia, and the CMPMg-VCM hydrogel killed the implanted bacteria and further inhibited their propa - gation, which protected the bone from infective osteolysis. The H&E and Masson staining results confirmed that the CMPMg- VCM hydrogel implanted group showed no obvious bone dam - age, but the CMP hydrogel implanted group showed severe bone destruction (even worse than the negative group).This might be due to that the CMP hydrogel, without antibacterial ability, pro- vided a gentle and comfortable environment beneficial for the growth and propagation of bacteria.After 6weeks of implanta - tion, the bacterial colony in the CMPMg-VCM group was almost the same as the positive control group (no SA-infected group), and Gram’s staining result also presented the same tendency, confirming no infection in tibia.
The appealing antibacterial, os- teogenic and injectable properties of this CMPMg-VCM hydrogel in OM treatment could be attributed to the burst release of VCM in the initial stage to destroy the bacterial biofilm, the small amount of VCM and the released magnesium ions and hydroxyl groups to bacteriostatic ability, and the suitable magnesium ions and alkalescent environment for osteogenic promotive properties. This CMPMg-VCM hydrogel showed great promise in OM treatment.Nevertheless, several points should be mentioned here, espe - cially for further studies.First, there were non-degradable com- ponents in this hydrogel system, but total degradation of this hydrogel in vivo during the implantation process was not ob- served.The further study will consider degradation testing, espe - cially in vivo animal studies.Second, the hydrogel was implanted in the tibia after the SA was injected (the bacterial biofilm was still not formed), and this animal model is different from OM in clinics.
Last but not least, the osteogenic promotive and antibac - terial mechanisms of this CMPMg-VCM hydrogel should be sys- tematically investigated in further study. Conclusions In this study, an injectable magnesium-coordinated phosphate CS-based hydrogel loaded with VCM (CMPMg-VCM) was success - fully fabricated via a metal-organic coordination strategy.The VCM in this hydrogel system would not affect the formation or anti-swelling properties of the hydrogel.The VCM was released from the CMPMg-VCM hydrogel during the in vitro immersion in PBS solution.The CMPMg-VCM hydrogel, especially VCM in high concentration, showed antibacterial properties that killed the SA and inhibited SA growth, and this antibacterial efficacy would last for 12days during the in vitro immersion process.The CMPMg-VCM hydrogels showed no cytotoxicity to MC3T3-E1 cells and would promote osteogenic differentiation for MC3T3-E1 cells in terms of promoting ALP expression and the formation of cal- cium nodules.
Finally, the CMPMg-VCM hydrogels would inhibit the propagation of SA, and kill the SA and protect the infected bone from osteolysis in the OM rat model. Taken together, the appealing antibacterial, non-cytotoxic and osteogenic promotive properties make this hydrogel an alternative biomaterial for OM treatment.Supplementary data Supplementary data are available at Regenerative Biomaterials online.Figure 13.Gram’s staining results for the infected area in the tibia bone after samples were implanted for 3 and 6weeks.The bluish-violet stained spheroid was the SA (red arrow).12 | Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol.11, rbae049 Funding The research was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (no.82202664), Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Orthopaedic Diseases and Biomaterials Research (no.ZDSYS20220606100602005), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (no.
