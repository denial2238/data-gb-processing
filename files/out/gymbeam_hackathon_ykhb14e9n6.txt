Cannabidiol Does Not Impact Acute Anabolic or Inﬂammatory Signaling in Skeletal Muscle In Vitro Henning T.Langer,1,*Alec Avey,2and Keith Baar1–3 Abstract Background: Cannabidiol (CBD) is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of clinical conditions includ- ing as an aid for muscle recovery.Previous work demonstrated that CBD exhibited mild effects on skeletal mus- cle, with a tendency to increase anabolic signaling and decrease inﬂammatory signaling.Methods: To gain mechanistic insight and extend these ﬁndings, we conducted a set of experiments using C2C12 myotubes.Results: Increasing the dose of CBD (1–5 lM) provided with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) showed no effect on anabolic signaling through mTORC1 (S6K1 [Thr389], p=0.27; rpS6 [Ser240/244], p=0.81; or 4E-BP1 [Thr37/46], p=0.87).
Similarly, inﬂammatory signaling through nuclear factor kappa B (NF- jB) (p105, p=0.88; p50, p=0.93; or phosphory- lated p65 [Ser536], p=0.84) in response to tumor necrosis factor a(TNFa) was unaffected by CBD (2.5 lM), whereas dioscin, a natural product that blocks NF- jB signaling, reduced p105 and phosphor ylated p65 (Ser536) compared with the TNF aand the TNF a+CBD condition ( p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). Finally, cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptor levels were measured in C2C12 cells, muri ne skeletal muscle, cortex, and hippocampus.Although CB1 was not detectable in muscle cells or muscle tiss ue, high levels were observed in brain tissue.Conclusion: In conclusion, CBD does not directly modulate anabolic or inﬂammatory signaling in myotubes in vitro , which can likely be explained by the lack of functional receptors.Keywords: muscle; CBD; mTORC1; NF- jB; inﬂammation; C2C12 Introduction Cannabidiol (CBD) is the main chemical compound in theCannabis sativa plant.
It has been shown to have several medical properties such as being an anticonvul-sant, analgesic, and anti-inﬂammatory. 1,2CBD was re- cently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of epilepsy and symptoms of multiple sclerosis.Other reports have shown that CBD has promise for the treatment of neuromuscular disor- ders.3Beyond its clinical application, the increasing na- tional and international legalization of CBD has caused a rise in medicinal use for the treatment of pain, sleep- lessness, or as a recovery aid after exercise.4Recently, we inves tigated the effect of acute adminis- tration of CBD on molecular signaling in skeletal muscle after eccentric exercise in rats.5We found that despite a relatively high dose of intraperitoneal CBD, the overalleffect on protein levels in ske letal muscle after exercise was modest.
There was a tendency for increased anabolic signaling through mTORC1 and a concomitant decrease in inﬂammatory signaling through nuclear factor kappa B( N F - jB) with the administration of CBD. Interestingly, previous research into drugs such as ibuprofen has indi- cated that blunting inﬂammatory signaling could have adverse effects on skeletal muscle adaptations and mus- cle growth in response to acute and chronic exercise.6,7 Departments of1Physiology and Membrane Biology and2Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior, University of California, Davis, California, USA.3VA Northern California Health Care System, Mather, California, USA.*Address correspondence to: Henning T.Langer, PhD, Department of Physiology and Membrane Biology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616-5270 , USA, E-mail: htlanger@ucdavis.edu ªHenning T.Langer et al.2021; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

However, robust evidence for such an effect of CBD on skeletal muscle is lacking and mechanistic in- sights are sparse.For example, it is currently unknownwhether the decrease in inﬂammatory markers that we previously observed in muscle in vivo was the result of a direct effect of CBD on muscle or an indirect effect on inﬂammatory cells.
To determine whether the decreased inﬂammation and the tendency to increase anabolism in vivo were the results of a direct action on muscle cells, we con- ducted a set of cell culture experiments in C2C12 myo- tubes. We hypothesized that CBD would amplifyanabolic signaling through the mTORC1 axis and de- crease inﬂammatory signaling through NF- jB.Materials and Methods Cell culture C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in growth media (high glucose Dulbecco ’s modiﬁed Eagle medium [DMEM], 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% penicillin) until they reached 95–100% conﬂuence at which time, they were shifted in to differentiation media (DM; high glucose DMEM, 2% horse serum, 0.1% penicillin) to promote the differentiation and fusion of cells to form myotubes.All experiments were con-ducted on fully formed myotubes 5 days after the in- troduction of DM.
Anabolic signaling The ﬁrst dose–response relationship experiment for CBDand anabolic signaling was assessed using a previously published protocol with modiﬁcations (Fig. 1).8Myo- tubes plated in six-well plates were fasted for 15 min by replacing DM with starvat ion media (SM; phosphate- buffered saline [PBS], 2% horse serum, and increasing dosages of CBD [0, 1, 2.5 and 5 lM]).The CBD product (Amber Metric, Santa Rosa, CA) was laboratory tested and hemp derived (99.8% purity).After the 15 min fast-ing period, SM in half of the w ells was replaced with DM containing insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (5 nM; PeproTech, NJ) and increasing dosages of CBD for a du- ration of 30 min before the cells were collected.To improve statistical power and based on the ab- sence of baseline differences in the ﬁrst experiment, we grew the cells on 24-well plates and omitted the starved condition from the second dose–response ex-periment (Fig.2).
Instead, DM in all wells was replaced with DM +IGF-1 (5 nM) with increasing dosages of CBD (0, 1, 2.5, and 5 lM) for 60 min before collection. Natural product screen for inhibitors of the NF- jB activity To identify natural products that could decrease the ac- tivity of NF- jB in response to tumor necrosis factor a (TNF a), NF- jB reporter (luc)-HEK293 cells (BPS Bio- science, San Diego, CA) containing the ﬁreﬂy luciferase gene driven by four copies of NF- jB response element were treated with 10 ng/mL TNF a.Following treat- ment for 6 h, cells were collected in passive lysis buf- fer and luciferase activity was determined using a GloMax(R) 20/20 Luminometer System w/dual injec- tors (Promega, Madison, WI).To ﬁnd NF- jB inhibitors, 146 structurally diverse, bioactive, and cell permeable natural products (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX)were added together with TNF aat a ﬁnal concentra- tion of 10 lM.
Of the six natural products that de- creased the NF- jB activity by more than 85%, the effect of increasing doses was determined. Data are presented for one of these natural products (dioscin).Inﬂammatory signaling For the experiment on CBD and acute inﬂammatorysignaling, C2C12 cells were differentiated into myo- tubes in 24-well plates.On the day of the experiment, existing media in the wells was replaced with freshDM that contained no additional compounds, DM + TNFa(2.5 ng/mL; PeproTech), DM +TNFa+CBD (2.5lM), or DM +TNFa+the phytochemical dio- scin (10 lM; Selleck Chemicals) as a positive control.Cells were treated for 1 h before collection (Fig.3).
Cannabinoid receptor type 1 protein levels To compare protein levels of cannabinoid receptortype 1 (CB1) between skeletal muscle in vitro and in vivo with a positive control (brain tissue), we used cell culture samples from the experiments above and analyzed them alongside of rat tibialis anterior tissue from previous CBD experiments 5and murine cortex and hippocampus samples (Fig. 4).Cell collection and Western blot analysis For assessment of global muscle protein synthesis via theSUnSET method, 50 lL of puromycin (45 lM; Research Products International, IL) w as added to every cell culture well 5 min before collection.Upon collection, all wells were placed on ice and washed three times with ice-cold PBS.CBD, ANABOLIC SIGNALING, AND INFLAMMATION IN MUSCLE 629 FIG.1.CBD and anabolic signaling in a fasted state and after IGF-1 treatment.

For the 24-well plate experiments, the collection protocol was identical exce pt for two modiﬁcations: after the last washing step with ice-cold PBS, 75 lLo f 1·LSB was directly added to each well before the samples were transferred to a fresh tube. The samples were then brieﬂy sonicated before boiling and storage at /C030/C176C until further analysis.Western blotting was carried out as described previ- ously.8Brieﬂy, for the cell culture experiments, 10 lLo f sample was loaded per lane, run for 40 min at 200 V, and transferred onto polyvinylidene ﬂuoride or nitrocel- lulose membrane in an ice-cold transfer buffer at 100 V for 30 min.For the rodent skeletal muscle and brain sam- ples, 10 lg of protein per lane was loaded.Membranes were blocked in 1% ﬁsh skin gelatin dissolved in Tris- buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 for 30 min and probed with the primary antibody overnight.
The follow- ing antibodies were used: Cell Signaling (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA): S6K1 (Thr389) (No. 9205; lot 16), ribosomal protein S6 (Ser240/244) (No.5364), 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) (No.2855), NF-kB p65 (Ser536) (No.3033; lot14), NF-kB p105/p50 (No.13586), CB1 re- ceptor (No.93815); Millipore Sigma (Merck Group): IRS1 (No.06-248; lot 2465193), puromycin (No.MABE343).Levels of each protein were normalized to total protein content per lane as assessed via Ponceau S staining of the membrane or a ﬂuorescent gel.9 Statistics Data analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism 9(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).One- or two-way analysis of variance combined with Dunnett’s (one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA]; Fig.2) or Tukey’s (one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA; Figs.1, 3, and 4) multiple comparison test to allocate differences post hocwere applied depending on the number of groups and variables.
The alpha level was set at p=0.05; p-values <0.05 were deemed statistically signiﬁcant, and p-values between 0.05 and 0.1 are described as trends. Results CBD and anabolic signaling in a fasted state and after IGF-1 treatment IRS1 protein showed a distinct upwards shift in the gel indicating post-translational modiﬁcation.The abso- lute amount of protein tended to increase with IGF-1treatment ( p=0.06) and CBD did not affect this pro- cess (CBD: p=0.65 and interaction: p=0.99; Fig.1A).Phosphorylated S6K1 (Thr389) levels increased signif- icantly with IGF-1 treatment ( p<0.0001) without sig- niﬁcant effect of CBD ( p=0.27) or an interaction effect (p=0.3).No differences at baseline or after IGF-1 treat- ment between the different CBD conditions could be detected via post hoc testing (Fig.1B).Similarly, phos- phorylated rpS6 (Ser240/244) increased with IGF-1treatment ( p<0.0001) without an effect of CBD (p=0.76) or an interaction effect ( p=0.91; Fig.1C).
Finally, global protein synthesis as assessed via puro- mycin increased signiﬁcantly with IGF-1 treatment (p<0.0001) and showed a trend for an effect of CBD (p=0.06) but no interaction effect ( p=0.18). Post hoc testing determined a difference between the IGF-1 con- trol condition and the IGF-1 CBD (5 lM) condition (p<0.05; Fig.1D).Dose–response relationship between CBD and mTORC1 signaling To increase technical replicates in each trial, the starved conditions were omitted and the effect of CBD on the IGF-1 response was determined.Total IRS1 proteinlevels did not differ signiﬁcantly (Fig.2A).Similarly, S6K1 (Thr389), rpS6 (Ser240/244), 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46), and puromycin failed to show a main effect of CBD (p=0.27, p=0.81, p=0.87, and p=0.26, respectively) orpost hoc group differences (Fig.2B–E).‰ FIG.2.Dose–response relationship between CBD and mTORC1 signaling.

We found a main effect for p105 protein levels (p<0.01) with group differences between the controlcondition and cells that were treated with TNF aand dio- scin ( p<0.05) as well as a difference between the TNF a condition and the TNF aplus dioscin condition ( p<0.05; Fig. 3D), whereas CBD had no effect.Phosphorylated p65 (Ser536) also showed a main effect ( p<0.001) with various group differences.TNF atreatment in- creased phosphorylated-p65 compared with the control condition ( p<0.001).Similarly, TNF ain conjunction with CBD increased phosphorylated-p65 levels signiﬁ- cantly ( p<0.01), whereas phosp horylated-p65 did not increase with TNF aand dioscin treatment.Accordingly, phosphorylated-p65 levels with TNF aor TNF aplus CBD were signiﬁcantly higher than with TNF aand FIG.3.CBD does not decrease inﬂammatory signaling through NF- jB after TNF atreatment.

There was no signiﬁcant effect of any treatment on p50 levels, but a trend toward a main effect ( p=0.07) and a trend toward a group difference between TNF aand TNFaplus dioscin ( p=0.05; Fig. 3F).CB1 receptor protein levels in C2C12 cells, rat skeletal muscle, and murine brain tissue Since CBD had modest effects on skeletal muscle in vitro and in vivo , levels of the main cannabinoid receptor(CB1) were determined in C2C12 cells and rat tibialis anterior muscle, each with and without CBD treatment.As a positive control, murine brain tissue from either the cortex or hippocampus where CB1 receptor is abundant was run in parallel.The predicted molecular weight of CB1 is 52.8 kDa, but the protein tends to run at around 60 kDa.CB1 was highest in the murine cortex, signiﬁ-cantly less CB1 was observed in the hippocampus (p<0.01), and the protein was not detected in either the C2C12 myotubes or the rat TA muscle (Fig.4).
Discussion In this study, we investigated the effect of CBD on ana-bolic and inﬂammatory signaling in C2C12 myotubes. We looked at the effect of CBD on mTORC1 signaling under fasted conditions and after addition of amino acids and IGF-1.We found that a range of 1–5 lMo f CBD had no effect on anabolic signaling through the mTORC1-axis.However, we did detect a small increase in global protein synthesis via puromycin after IGF-1 treatment for the highest CBD dose.Since there were no baseline differences, the effect of CBD (5 lM) on puromy- cin after IGF-1 was small, and the technical replicates were limited ( n=3; Fig.2), we decided to repeat the experiment, double the technical replicates, and omit the fasted condi- tion.In our follow-up experiment with increased statistical power (Fig.3), the observed tendency of higher protein levels of mTORC1 signaling and global protein synthesis with increasing dosages of CBD disappeared.
To investigate the anti-inﬂammatory properties of CBD in muscle cell culture, we tested NF- jB signaling in the presence or absence of TNF a, together with CBD or a natural product inhibitor of NF- jB activation dio- scin. Dioscin was identiﬁed as a potent inhibitor of TNFausing an NF- jB reporter cell line to screen 146 natural products.Compared with dioscin, CBD had lit- tle to no effect on inﬂammatory signaling through the NF-jB axis in muscle cells.Although dioscin decreased the phosphorylation and activation of p65 (Ser536), p105, and tended to decrease NF- jB p50, CBD had no effect on NF- jB signaling.To determine whether the inability of CBD to affect anabolism or inﬂammatory signaling in C2C12 myo- tubes was the result of low receptor number, the pri- mary CBD receptor CB1 was determined in C2C12 cells and skeletal muscle of rodents and compared with the cortex and hippocampus.
Neither myotubes nor muscle demonstrated CB1 protein, and this likely explains the observation that CBD did not affect myo- tubes in cell culture and had modest effects on muscle FIG. 4.CB1 receptor protein levels in C2C12 cells, rat skeletal muscle, and murine brain tissue.Protein levels of CB1 in C2C12 cells with and without IGF-1 treatment (5 nM) in the presence or absence of CBD (5 lM), rat tibialis anterior after eccentric exercise in the presence orabsence of CBD (100 mg/kg body weight administered intraperitoneally), mouse cortex, and mouse hippocampus.* p-Value <0.05 compared with all other conditions.n=8 biological replicates (C2C12 cells), n=8a n i m a l s (rat tibialis anterior), n=4 animals (murine cortex), and n=4 animals (murine hippocampus).CB1, cannabinoid receptor type 1.634 LANGER ET AL.in vivo .
Previous studies on CB1 in muscle were able to detect CB1 in skeletal muscle cell culture and in rodent muscle samples.10–12However, these studies used im- munoprecipitation of speciﬁc subfractions to enrich CB1 in an effort to detect CB1 protein levels. It is pos- sible that using these methods we would be able to detect CB1 in our samples.However, the currentwork clearly demonstrates that the cellular abundance of CB1 is orders of magnitude lower in muscle cells than in brain tissue.This observation is in line with ear- lier ﬁndings on the subject.13,14 A signiﬁcant issue with any cell culture experiment is dosing and the translatability of ﬁndings to the in vivo setting.In our previous experiments in rats, we com- bined eccentric exercise with the injection of 100 mg CBD per kg bodyweight (intraperitoneal).5Deiana et al.
have measured plasma CBD levels after intraper- itoneal injection of 120 mg per kg bodyweight in mice.15Plasma levels peaked at 14 lg/mL at 120 min after injection, equivalent to about 45 mM. Since the dosage we used in our cell culture experiments is con- siderably lower (1–5 lM), it is possible that CBD would have started to exhibit effects at higher concentrations.However, in a recent systematic review on CBD in cell culture, the authors concluded that CBD starts to nega- tively impact cell viability at doses higher than 2 lM and induces apoptosis at dosages higher than 10 lM.16 Therefore, we chose 5 lM as the upper limit of our dose–response studies.Indeed, we performed a subset of our experiments with 10 lM without seeing any bene- ﬁcial effects compared with 5 lM.Similarly, going out to 2 4 hw i t ht h eC B Dt r e a t m e n tc o n c o m i t a n t l yw i t hT N F a or before the addition of IGF-1 had no effect on NF- jB or mTORC1 signaling, respectively (data not shown).
Furthermore, it is important to remember that the effects of CBD on anabolic and inﬂammatory signal-ing in our in vivo experiments were small. 5This was the case despite a relatively high dose and an efﬁcient route of administration, which could be associated with toxicity in chronic settings.17–20Given this con- text, it appears unlikely that there is a direct physio- logical role for CBD in anabolic and inﬂammatory signaling within skeletal muscle tissue.Even though our data indicate that direct effects of CBD on anabolic or inﬂammatory signaling in skeletal muscle in vitro are small, it is still possible that CBD could exert indirect effects in vivo through modulation of immune cells that interact with skeletal muscle or by causing systemic changes to circulating cytokines and hormones that affect the central nervous system,immune system, and other endocrinologically active tissues.
Future research needs to determine whether such indirect effects could be clinically relevant and whether they can be elicited without requiring toxic dosages of CBD. Additionally, future projects will need to investigate in how far the effects of CBD on skeletal muscle may differ from other cannabinoids,endocannabinoids and analogs.Author Disclosure Statement No competing ﬁnancial interests exist.Funding Information This study was supported via a Research Investmentsin Cannabis and Hemp (RICH) project grant to H.T.L.by the Cannabis and Hemp Research Center (CHRC) at the University of California, Davis.References 1.Lattanzi S, Brigo F, Trinka E, et al.Efﬁcacy and safety of cannabidiol in epilepsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Drugs.2018;78:1791–1804.2.Iskedjian M, Bereza B, Gordon A, et al.Meta-analysis of cannabis based treatments for neuropathic and multiple sclerosis-related pain.Curr Med Res Opin.2007;23:17–24.3.Iannotti FA, Pagano E, Moriello AS, et al.
