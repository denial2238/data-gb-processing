Key Words: omega -3 fatty acids, pro teinuri a, systematic review, meta -analysis INTRODUCTION Proteinuria, characterized by the presence of excessive protein in urine, stands as a hallmark of numerous renal and systemic disorders.1 Beyond its diagnostic value, pro- teinuria serves as a potent predictor of adverse clinical outcomes, particularly in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).2 Ele- vated urinary protein levels not only signify underlying renal injury but also herald increased risks of kidney function decline, end -stage renal disease (ESRD), and cardiovascular events.3,4 The importance of identifying effective strategies to mitigate proteinuria and its associ- ated risks cannot be overstated.
In the quest for therapeutic interventions to ameliorate proteinuria, omega -3 fatty acids have garnered substantial attention.5 Omega -3 fatty acids, predominantly found in fish oils and certain plant sources, have long been recog- nized for their cardiovascular benefits, primarily attribut- ed to their anti -inflammatory and anti -atherogenic proper- ties.6,7 Beyond their established role in cardiovascular health, emerging evidence suggests that omega -3 fatty acids may exert a favorable impact on renal function, particularly in the context of proteinuria.8,9 The potential therapeutic utility of omega -3 fatty acids in reducing proteinuria stems from their multifaceted mechanisms of action.10 These bioactive lipids are known to modulate inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system, all of which are intricately involved in renal pathology.11 Additionally, omega -3 fatty acids may influence glomerular and tubular function, ultimately affecting protein filtration and reab- sorption processes.12 While individual studies and clinical trials have inves- tigated the effects of omega -3 fatty acids on proteinuria, the collective body of evidence has yet to be systematical- ly synthesized and rigorously evaluated.
A comprehen- sive review and meta -analysis of available studies are warranted to elucidate the potential role of omega -3 fatty acids in reducing proteinuria and its associated clinical implications.

Furthermore, we aim to explore potential mechanisms underlying any observed effects and offer insights into the clinical rele- vance of omega -3 fatty acids in the management of pro- teinuria. METHODS Search strategy and data sources To conduct a comprehensive systematic review, we sys- tematically searched electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library.The search encompassed studies published up to September 2023, and no lower date limit was applied.Our search strategy employed a combination of keywords and medi- cal subject headings (MeSH) related to omega -3 fatty acids, proteinuria, and relevant synonyms.The search strategy was developed with the assistance of a skilled medical librarian to ensure inclusivity and comprehen- siveness.We also reviewed the reference lists of included articles and relevant systematic reviews for any additional eligible studies.
Inclusion criteria Study Design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), co- hort studies, case -control studies, and cross -sectional studies were considered for inclusion. Studies that as- sessed the administration of omega -3 fatty acids, includ- ing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), either as supplements or dietary sources, were eligible.The primary outcome of interest was the change in pro- teinuria levels as measured by 24 -hour urinary protein excretion.Exclusion criteria Studies not reporting relevant outcomes or not involving Omega -3 fatty acid interventions.Animal studies, reviews, editorials, and conference ab- stracts, studies with insufficient data for quantitative analysis, duplicate publications or secondary analyses of the same study population.Study selection and data extraction Two independent reviewers (insert names or initials) con- ducted the initial screening of titles and abstracts to iden- tify potentially eligible studies.
Subsequently, full -text articles of selected studies were reviewed for final inclu- sion. Discrepancies in study selection were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer (insert name or initials) when necessary.Assessment of methodological quality and risk of bias For RCTs, the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess the methodological quality of included studies.Cohort and case -control studies were evaluated using the Newcastle -Ottawa Scale.13 Cross -sectional studies were assessed using relevant criteria adapted from established tools.Risk of bias assessment was conducted inde- pendently by two reviewers, and any discrepancies were resolved through discussion.
Data synthesis and statistical analysis Meta -analysis was conducted using appropriate statistical software (STATA version 12) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.14 For continuous out- comes, standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to account for variations in measurement scales among studies. Hetero- geneity between studies was assessed using the I2 statis- tic, with I2 > 50% indicating substantial heterogeneity.A random -effects model was used when significant hetero- geneity was present; otherwise, a fixed -effects model was applied.Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were planned to explore potential sources of heterogeneity.Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots, Egger's test, and the fail -safe N method .RESULTS Through our exploration of the database, a total of 562 records were identified.
Following the removal of 241 duplicate entries, we proceeded to evaluate the titles and abstracts of the remaining 321 records. Subsequently, 152 papers were excluded based on predetermined criteria, leaving us with 71 studies for comprehensive full -text assessment.During this phase, two records were excluded in accordance with our eligibility criteria.Ultimately, our meta -analysis incorporated a total of nine studies, as illus- trated in Figure 1.Study characteristics Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of the includ- ed studies .A total of ten studies were identified for inclu- sion in this systematic review and meta -analysis.These studies were published between 1989 and 2015, reflecting research conducted in various countries, including Greece, Italy, Japan, the USA, Sweden, and Australia.The sample sizes across these studies ranged from 19 to 54 participants, with a total of 347 participants included in the analysis.
The primary focus of these studies was on the impact of omega -3 fatty acids in the context of kidney diseases, particularly IgA nephropathy, ADPKD (auto- somal dominant polycystic kidney disease), chronic kid- ney disease (CKD) and diabetic nephropathy. The dura- tion of intervention varied among studies, ranging from 2 months to 4 years.Intervention and control groups The interventions utilized in the included studies were diverse.Some studies employed eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and/or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as the prima- ry omega -3 fatty acids, with doses ranging from 1.8 g/day to 12 g/day.Additionally, some studies combined omega - 3 supplementation with renin -angiotensin system blockers (RASB), angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) as part of the intervention.Control groups, on the other hand, re- ceived placebo trea tments, olive oil, supportive care, or no treatment, depending on the study design.
The choice Role of omega -3 in reducing proteinuria 315 of control intervention was tailored to the specific re- search objectives of each study. Disease status and JADAD scores The studies primarily focused on kidney -related condi- tions, with a particular emphasis on IgA nephropathy.The included studies evaluated participants with IgA nephropathy, ADPKD, or CKD.The JADAD scores, a measure of study quality, ranged from 2 to 4, indicating a moderate to high level of methodological quality across the studies.15 These scores reflect the rigor of randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs, which are robust for as- sessing the efficacy of interventions.Figure 1.PRISMA flow diagram for the investigated studies.Table 1.

Some investigations spanned over a course of 2 months, while others extended up to 4 years. These variations in intervention duration provide insights into the potential short -term and long -term effects of omega -3 fatty acid supplementation in the context of kidney dis- eases.Effect size estimation The meta -analysis was conducted using both fixed and random effect models.The standardized mean difference (SMD) values along with their corresponding 95% confi- dence intervals (CI) were calculated for each study.The results are summarized in Figure 2.Overall effect size Under the common effect model, the overall effect size (SMD) was estimated to be 0.0599 (95% CI [ -0.2054; 0.3252]), indicating a non -significant effect (z = 0.44, p = 0.6582).Similarly, under the random effects model, the overall effect size was -0.1600 (95% CI [ -1.5526; 1.2326]), also indicating a non -significant effect (z = - 0.27, p = 0.7937).
Heterogeneity Substantial heterogeneity was observed among the in- cluded studies. The estimated between -study variance (tau2) was 2.4473 (95% CI [0.9532; 11.7919]), corre- sponding to a tau value of 1.5644 (95% CI [0.9763; 3.4339]).The I2 statistic, representing the percentage of variation attributed to heterogeneity, was 91.1% (95% CI [84.9%; 94.8%]), and the H statistic was 3.35 (95% CI [2.57; 4.37]), both indicating substantial heterogeneity.A test of heterogeneity (Q) resulted in a significant p- value of < 0.0001 (Q = 78.74, degrees of freedom = 7), further confirming the presence of significant heterogene- ity.Publication bias Publication bias was assessed using the Egger's Regres- sion Test, and the results suggested that there might be publication bias.However, the number of studies includ- ed in the analysis was less than the recommended thresh- old of nine for a more valid assessment of publication bias.
Funnel plot (trim and fill) The funnel plot analysis did not reveal any potential pub- lication bias. The results of the linear regression test of funnel plot asymmetry showed a p-value of 0.4012 (Fig- ure 3) .DISCUSSION Our systematic review and meta -analysis involved a comprehensive exploration of the role of omega -3 fatty acids in reducing proteinuria by analyzing data from a diverse set of studies.This approach allowed us to gain insights from research conducted across different coun- tries and settings.The diversity in study populations and settings contributes to the robustness of our analysis, of- fering a broad perspective on the potential benefits of omega -3 fatty acid supplementation in proteinuria man- agement.One of the striking aspects of our analysis was the var- iability in the intervention approaches adopted across the included studies.Omega -3 fatty acids encompass various forms, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and do- cosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
The doses administered ranged from 1.8 g/day to 12 g/day, reflecting a spectrum of treatment regimens. Furthermore, several studies com- bined omega -3 supplementation with renin -angiotensin system blockers (RASB), angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) as part of the intervention strategy.In contrast, control groups received diverse control interventions, such as placebo treatments, olive oil, supportive care, or no treatment.The versatility of intervention approaches underscores the multifaceted nature of omega -3 fatty acid supplementation and its potential for customization based on the specific objectives of each study.The primary medical conditions under scrutiny in the included studies were kidney -related diseases, with an emphasis on IgA nephropathy.This focus reflects the growing interest in exploring the therapeutic effects of omega -3 fatty acids in managing proteinuria in the con- text of nephropathies.
Additionally, studies assessed par- ticipants with ADPKD and CKD, and diabetic nephropa- thy broadening the scope of conditions examined. The assessment of study quality using JADAD scores revealed that the included studies demonstrated a moder- ate to high level of methodological quality.These scores reflect the rigorous nature of randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs, widely recognized for their robustness in assessing the efficacy of interventions.Figure 2.Forest plot for proteinuria meta -analysis.Role of omega -3 in reducing proteinuria 317 The duration of omega -3 fatty acid interventions varied significantly among the studies.Some investigations fo- cused on short -term interventions lasting only 2 months, while others extended over a span of 4 years.This diver- sity in intervention durations provides valuable insights into the potential short -term and long -term effects of omega -3 fatty acid supplementation in the context of pro- teinuria management.
It is essential to consider the impli- cations of these varying durations when interpreting the findings, as they may inform clinical recommendations regarding the optimal duration of omega -3 fatty acid sup- plementation. Our meta -analysis, employing both fixed -effect and random -effects models, provided estimates of the overall effect size of omega -3 fatty acids on proteinuria reduc- tion.However, it's noteworthy that under both models, the overall effect sizes were not statistically significant, indi- cating a neutral effect.These findings suggest that, as a whole, the studies included in our analysis did not demonstrate a substantial impact of omega -3 fatty acid supplementation on proteinuria reduction.Nonetheless, the clinical significance of these results should not be dismissed outright.It is important to recog- nize that individual responses to omega -3 fatty acids may vary, and factors such as dosage, duration, and patient characteristics may influence outcomes.
Additionally, while our meta -analysis may not have shown a significant overall effect, it is possible that specific subgroups of patients or particular conditions may benefit from omega - 3 fatty acid supplementation. Therefore, the neutral over- all effect size should not discourage further exploration and research into the potential use of omega -3 fatty acids as part of comprehensive proteinuria management strate- gies.A significant challenge in our analysis was the substan- tial heterogeneity observed among the included studies, as indicated by high I2 and H statistics.This heterogeneity may stem from differences in patient populations, varia-tions in intervention protocols, and diverse control inter- ventions employed across the studies.It underscores the need for cautious interpretation of the overall effect size and emphasizes the importance of investigating potential sources of heterogeneity in future research.Our assessment of publication bias yielded mixed re- sults.
While Egger's Regression Test suggested the possi- bility of publication bias, the funnel plot analysis did not reveal obvious signs of such bias. It is essential to acknowledge that the number of studies included in our analysis fell short of the recommended threshold for a robust assessment of publication bias.Therefore, the im- plications of potential publication bias should be inter- preted with caution.Future research should prioritize investigating specific patient profiles that may derive the most substantial bene- fit from omega -3 fatty acid supplementation.Additional- ly, the optimization of dosage, duration, and timing of omega -3 fatty acid interventions should be explored with- in comprehensive proteinuria management strategies.As our understanding of the intricate relationship between omega -3 fatty acids and proteinuria continues to evolve, it opens doors to personalized therapeutic approaches that may contribute to improved kidney health and better pa- tient outcomes.
Conclusion In summary, our systematic review and meta -analysis did not find statistically significant evidence supporting the overall efficacy of omega -3 fatty acids in reducing pro- teinuria across various kidney -related conditions. Howev- er, the complexity of this field, marked by diverse patient populations and intervention approaches, suggests that individual responses to omega -3 supplementation may vary.These results emphasize the need for targeted re- search to identify specific subgroups or conditions that may bene fit from omega -3 fatty acid interventions.While our findings do not provide a definitive conclusion, they Figure 3.Funnel plot for meta -analysis of the studies.318 L Fei, R Huang and Z Li contribute to the evolving understanding of omega -3 fatty acids' potential role in personalized kidney health strate- gies, paving the way for further exploration and optimiza- tion of their therapeutic applications .
