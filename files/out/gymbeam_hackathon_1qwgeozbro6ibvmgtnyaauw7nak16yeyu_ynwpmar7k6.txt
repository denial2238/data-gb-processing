Objective: This study investigated the effects of folic acid (FA) and/orcreatinesupplementationontheproportionofAsmetabolites in urine. Design:Ina24-wkrandomized,double-blinded,placebo-controlled trial, 622 participants were assigned to receive FA (400 or 800 μgp e rd a y ) ,3gc r e a t i n ep e rd a y ,4 0 0 μgF A+3 g creatine per day, or placebo.The majority of participants were folate sufficient; all received As-removal water filters.From wk 12–24, half of the participants receiving FA received placebo.Results: Among groups receiving FA, the mean decrease in ln(%InAs)and%MMAsandincreasein%DMAsexceededthoseof the placebo group at wk 6 and 12 ( P<0.05).In the creatine group, the mean decrease in %MMAs exceeded that of the placebo group at wk 6 and 12 ( P<0.05); creatine supplementation did not affect change in %InAs or %DMAs.The decrease in %MMAs at wk 6 and 12 was larger in the 800 µg FA than in the 400 µg FA group (P=0.034).
There were no differences in treatment effects between the 400µg FA and creatine +FA groups. Data suggest a rebound in As metabolite proportions after FA cessation; at wk 24, log(%InAs) and %DMAs were not significantly different than baseline levels among participants who discontinued FA supplementation.Conclusions: The results of this study confirm that FA sup- plementation rapidly and significantly increases methylation of InAs to DMAs.Further research is needed to understand the strong cross-sectional associations between urinary creatinine and As methylation in previous studies.This trial was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01050556.Am J Clin Nutr 2019;109:380–391.Keywords: folate, folic acid, creatine, one-carbon metabolism, arsenic, arsenic metabolism, Bangladesh, monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acidIntroduction Chronic arsenic exposure is a major global public health issue (1).
In Bangladesh, roughly 57 million people are exposed to concentrationsindrinkingwaterexceedingtheWHO’sguideline of 10 μg/L (2,3). Chronic As exposure is associated with a rangeofhealthoutcomesincludingskinlesions,skinandinternal cancers, neurologic impairment, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and endocrine disruption ( 1).Ingested inorganic As (InAs) undergoes a series of stepwise biotransformation reactions in which it is methylated by ar- senic methyltransferase (AS3MT) ( 4) using the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to form monomethylarsonic acid (MMAsV) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAsV)(Figure 1)(5).Variation in As methylation capacity between populations and Supported by National Cancer Institute grant R01 CA133595:MVG, Na- tionalInstituteofEnvironmentalHealthSciencesgrantsP30ES009089,T32 ES007322, P42 ES010349, R01 ES017875:MVG, and F31 ES029019:AKB, and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences grant TL1 TR001875.

Complete methylation of As to DMAsVis importantastoxicologicstudieshavedemonstratedthatMMAsIII is the most toxic As species ( 7,8). Although the relative toxicity of MMAsIIIand MMAsVis difficult to assess in human studies because MMAsIIIis rapidly oxidized to MMAsV,ah i g h e r proportion of urinary MMAs(III+V)has been associated with higher risk of arsenic-induced skin lesions ( 9–11), peripheral vascular disease, skin and bladder cancers, and atherosclerosis, as reviewed by Steinmaus et al.( 12).Arsenic methylation is dependent on one-carbon metabolism for SAM synthesis ( 13).In this pathway, the one-carbon unit carried by 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) is transferred to homocysteine to form methionine, which is activated to form SAM.Dietary creatine may also affect As metabolism.
Endogenousbiosynthesisofcreatineconsumesanestimated40% ofSAM( 14).Dietarycreatineconsumptionfromanimalsources downregulates endogenous creatine biosynthesis, reducing the loss of methyl groups incurred by creatine biosynthesis. Among omnivores,approximatelyhalfofthebody’ssupplyofcreatineis provided by food ( 14).We have examined the role of folate nutritional status on As methylation in several prior studies ( 15–17).The effects of supplementation with 400 μg folic acid (FA) per day, the US recommendeddailyallowance(RDA),amongBangladeshiadults withlowplasmafolate( <9nmol/L)weretestedinarandomized controlled trial (RCT).After 12 wk, the treatment group had a significantly larger increase in the percentage of urinary dimethyl-arsenical species (%DMAs) and decreases in urinary ln(%InAs), the percentage of urinary monomethyl-arsenical species (%MMAs) (16), total blood As, and blood MMAs ( 17) as compared with the placebo group.
Changes in total blood As in the RCT we present here have been previously published ( 20- 46).AmongAs-exposedBangladeshiadultsselectedindependent of folate status, a larger decrease in ln(blood As) was observed in the treatment group receiving 800 μg FA per day for 12 wk relative to the placebo group. Urinary creatinine, a catabolite of creatine,hasalsobeennegativelyassociatedwithurinary%InAs and positively associated with urinary %DMAs ( 15, 16-44, 21–24).It is not known if FA supplementation increases As methy- lation in a population of mixed folate-deficient and -sufficient individuals, which may have important policy implications.The current RCT investigated the effects of 400 μg/d and 800 μg/d FAsupplementationonurinaryAsmetabolitesamongthegeneral population of As-exposed adults in Araihazar, Bangladesh.
We also tested the effect of reducing methylation demand through creatine supplementation on As methylation.Methods Subjects The Folic Acid and Creatine Trial (FACT) is an RCT that has been previously described ( 20). Briefly, FACT participants were recruited from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS), a prospective cohort study of >30,000 adults living in Araihazar, Bangladesh that was initiated in 2000 ( 25).HEALS participants were married, residing in the study area for ≥5 y, and drinking from their household well for ≥3y .F A C T participantswererandomlyselectedfromtheHEALScohortand wereeligibleiftheyweredrinkingfor ≥1yfromahouseholdwell that had an As concentration ≥50μg/L.Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, taking nutritional supplements, having proteinuria, renaldisease, diabetes, gastrointestinal problems, orother health problems.Study design The study design has been described in detail by Peters et al.(20).
A total of 622 participants were recruited ( Supplemental Figure 1: Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CON- SORT) Flow Diagram). The sample size was selected to achieve 80%poweratalpha =0.05todetectamoderateeffectsizeinthe mean differences in change in total blood As concentrations or percentage urinary As metabolites between 2 treatment groups (i.e., 0.45 SD) and assuming some participants might not completethestudy.Participantswererandomlyassignedto1of5 treatmentgroups:placebo( n=104),400 μgFAperday(referred to as 400FA; n=156), 800 μg FA per day (800FA; n=154), 3 g creatine per day (creatine; n=104), and 3 g creatine and 400 μg FA per day (creatine +400FA; n=104).To ensure an equal number of men and women in each treatment group and balance between treatment groups, men and women were randomized separately and in blocks, and assigned to treatment groups in the ratio 1 (placebo):1.5 (400FA):1.5 (800FA):1 (creatine):1 (creatine +400FA).
The order of treatment assignments within the blocks was determined by a random permutation generated by a statistician at Columbia University. One data management specialist in the United States and 1 in Bangladesh assigned letters to treatment groups (i.e., A, B, C, D, E).The creatine dose of 3 g/d was selected to overcompensate for daily creatine loss,approximately1.9gfora20–39-y-old70-kgmale,andthus to be sufficient to downregulate endogenous creatine synthesis (14).All supplements were obtained from Atrium Innovations, Inc.(Westmount, Quebec).Field staff received barcode-labeled pill bottles from a pharmacist and distributed bottles in order 382 BOZACK ET AL.

The primary outcome of interest (previously published) was total blood As (20). For the current analyses, data from the first phase of the study were employed to evaluate our ap r i o r i secondary outcomes, i.e., the effects of FA and/or creatine supplementation onAsmethylationcapacity.Duringthesecondphaseofthestudy, participants in the 400FA and 800FA groups were randomly assigned to continue FA supplementation (400 μgF Ap e r day, referred to as 400FA/FA: n=77; 800 μgF Ap e rd a y , 800FA/FA: n=77) or receive placebo (400FA/placebo: n=76; 800FA/placebo: n=74) for the duration of the trial (wk 12–24).Participants in the creatine and creatine +400FA groups were also given placebo during the second phase in order to maintain the study blind.Data from the second phase of the study were usedtodetermineifareboundinurinaryAsmetabolitesoccurred after FA supplementation was discontinued.
Ethics The study protocol was approved by the Columbia University Medical Center Institutional Review Board and the Bangladesh Medical Research Council. Staff physicians in Bangladesh obtained informed consent from participants.Fieldwork Five trained teams, each consisting of 1 interviewer and 1 physician, recruited participants and performed all follow-up home visits during which biological samples were collected.Venousbloodsampleswerecollectedatbaseline,wk12,andwk 24.Urine samples were collected at baseline and wk 1, 6, 12, 13, 18, and 24.Study recruitment and follow-up were conducted from December 2009 through May 2011.All participants received READ-F As removal filters (READ-F filter; Brota Services International, Bangladesh) and were repeatedly encouraged to use them for all drinking and cooking water throughout the study ( 26).
During the first phase, all participants received 2 pill bottles: 1 containing FA pills or matched placebo pills, and 1 containing creatine pills or matched placebo pills. During the second phase, all participants received 1 pill bottle containing FA pills or matched placebo pills.Villagehealthworkersperformeddailyhomevisits,during which they observed participants take the pills or inquired about compliance.At the end of each study phase, pill bottles were collected and pill counts were performed.Compliance ranged from79.1%to100%(median:99.5%;IQR:98.3%,100.0%)and did not differ substantially between treatment groups or study phases (20).
Twelve participants were dropped from the study owing to adverseevents( n=6;placebogroup:abdominalcramps;400FA group: hypertension; 800FA group: abdominal cramps, severe vertigo,bilateralhydronephrosis;creatinegroup:severevertigo), pregnancy ( n=3; 400FA, creatine, and creatine +400FA groups), missing baseline blood sample ( n=1; creatine group), and dropout ( n=2; placebo and 400FA groups). The remaining sample consisted of 610 participants (placebo: n=102; 400FA: n=153; 800FA: n=151; creatine: n=101; creatine +400FA: n=103) (Supplemental Figure 1).Sample handling Venous blood was collected in vacutainer tubes containing EDTA.Blood samples were stored in IsoRack cool packs (Brinkmann Instruments, Riverview, FL) at 0 °C.Within 4 h, FOLIC ACID SUPPLEMENTATION AND ARSENIC METHYLATION 383 samples were transported to the field clinic in Araihazar.Plasma was separated from venous blood by centrifugation at 3000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C.
Whole blood and plasma samples were stored at −80°C and shipped on dry ice to Columbia Univer- sity for analysis. Urine was collected in 50-mL acid-washed polypropylene tubes, stored in portable coolers for transport to the field clinic within 4 h, frozen at −20°C, and shipped to Columbia University on dry ice.Water arsenic ToassessbaselineAsexposure,unfilteredwatersamplesfrom thetubewellsusedbystudyparticipantswerecollected.Samples werecollectedin20-mLpolyethylenescintillationvials,acidified to1%withtheuseofhigh-purityOptimaHCl(FisherScientific) for≥48 h, diluted 1:10, and analyzed via high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with germanium spike to correct for fluctuations in sensitivity.To monitor As removal by the filters, filtered water was tested in thefieldwithHachEZArsenictestkits;approximately50filters were replaced during the study ( 26).Laboratory measures Laboratory methods have been described in detail by Peters et al.(20).
Briefly, total blood As in whole blood was assessed throughtheuseofaPerkinElmerElanDRCIIICP-MS(Waltham, MA) with an AS 93 +autosampler (intra- and interassay CVs: 2.7% and 5.7%, respectively). Plasma folate and B-12 were assessed via radioimmunoassay (SimulTRAC-SNB; MP Biomedicals,SantaAna,CA)(plasmafolateintra-andinterassay CVs: 5% and 13%, respectively; B-12 intra- and interassay CVs:6%and17%,respectively).Plasmatotalhomocysteinewas measuredwithhigh-performanceliquidchromatography(HPLC) with fluorescence detection (intra- and interassay CVs: 5% and 7%, respectively).Urinary As metabolites were measured via HPLC sep- aration of arsenobetaine, arsenocholine, AsIII,A sV, MMAs (MMAsIII+MMAs V), and DMAs, and detection by ICP-MS with a dynamic reaction cell as described by Reuter et al.( 27) (intra- and interassay CVs for arsenobetaine +arsenocholine: 10.1% and 12.2%; AsIII+AsV: 2.7%, 4.7%; MMAs: 2.8%, 3.9%; DMAs: 0.6% and 1.3%, respectively).

Study sample Six follow-up urine samples were missing, and 18 urine samples with missing SG were removed from the dataset.We suspect that some participants may have added water to urine collection cups in an effort to increase fluid volume.Therefore, urine samples with SG ≤1.001, outside the normal range ( 28), were removed from the dataset ( n=620 out of 4239 samples).Samples with %InAs ≥55 were also considered to be outside of normal values ( 29) and removed ( n=22 out of 3619 samples); participants without a baseline urine sample ( n=50) or without themajorityofurinesamples(i.e., ≥4timepoints)( n=17)werealso removed.One participant with baseline SG of 1.002, but biologicallyimplausiblyhightotalurinaryAs,wasalsoremoved.
A total of 542 participants were included in analyses (placebo: n=90; 400FA: n=133; 800FA: n=129; creatine: n=94; creatine +400FA: n=96) (Supplemental Figure 1). With the exceptionofurineAsmetabolites,baselinecharacteristicsdidnot differ significantly between participants included and excluded from analyses.The concentrations of urinary As metabolites were adjusted for between-individual differences in urine dilution at each time point by multiplying the sample concentration by the ratio (mean SG – 1)/(subject’s SG – 1) ( 30).Arsenobetaine and arsenocholine are nontoxic dietary sources of As ( 31) and were therefore excluded from analyses.Seven samples had urinary AsIIIconcentrations below the limit of detection (LOD).These samples were replaced with values of LOD/2.The proportions of each As metabolite in urine were calculated by dividing the concentrationofeachspeciesbytheconcentrationoftotalurinary As (AsIII+AsV+MMAs +DMAs).
Statistical analysis Anintent-to-treatapproachwasusedinallanalyses.Summary statistics for baseline characteristics by treatment group were calculated. Overall differences between treatment groups at baseline were detected through the use of the Kruskall-Wallis test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categoric variables.One-factorANOVAwasusedtodetecttreatmentgroup differences in urinary As metabolites and nutritional factors at baseline and follow-up, where %InAs, red blood cell (RBC) folate, plasma folate, and homocysteine were log transformed to meet model assumptions.To compare each of the 4 treatment groups with the placebo group, Dunnett’s ttest with multiple comparisonswasusedtocontroltheTypeIexperiment-wiseerror rate for each As metabolite variable.Linearmodelswithrepeatedmeasureswereappliedtotheout- comes of percentage urinary As metabolites measured over time to examine treatment effects during the first phase.
Percentage InAs was log transformed to improve model fitting and reduce theimpactofextremevalues.Modelsincludedpredictorsoftime, treatmentgroup,andgroup-by-timeinteractions.Theinteraction parameters indicate treatment group differences in mean within- person change since baseline. A generalized estimating equation approach was used to estimate model parameters and test hypotheses with the use of all available data and accounting for within-subject correlations in the repeated measures.The Wald test was used to detect differences in the within-person change in As metabolite proportions between each treatment group and the placebo group.The Wald test was also used to examine if within-personchangeintheproportionofurinaryAsmetabolites differed between the 400FA, 800FA, and creatine +400FA treatment groups.To aid interpretation, group differences in the mean within-person changes were derived from relevant model parameters.
The rebound in urinary As metabolites after cessation of FA supplementation during the second phase (wk 12–24) was similarlyassessedthroughtheuseoflinearmodelswithrepeated measures applied to the 400FA and 800FA groups. The models that described the data well included parameters for treatment groups, time (wk 0, 12, and 24), continuation status of FA 384 BOZACK ET AL.

Analyses were performed with the use of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) or R 3.2.2 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) (32).Results Baseline characteristics by treatment group are presented inTable 1.Participants ranged in age from 24 to 55 y, and approximately half (51.5%) were men.There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in age; sex; BMI; history of betel nut use or smoking; land ownership; water, blood, and urinary As concentrations; urinary As species concentrations; or nutritional status, including RBC andplasmafolate,folatestatus,plasmaB-12,B-12status,plasma homocysteine, and hyperhomocysteinemia.
Urinary creatinine was significantly correlated with %InAs at baseline (Spearmancorrelation coefficient rs=−0.28, P<0.001) and %DMAs (rs=0.13, P=0.002). There were no significant treatment group differences in baseline percentage urinary As metabolites (Kruskall-Wallis test %InAs P=0.136; %MMAs P=0.578; %DMAs P=0.235).After treatment began, there was an initial decrease in total urinary As among all treatment groups as a result of the use of As removal filters.There was also a notable initial decrease in SG and urinary creatinine concentrations, suggesting that participants were drinking more water after receiving the filters.We consider this to be a “new toy effect,” however, as total urinary As concentration, SG, and urinary creatinine concentration gradually increased after the first week, indicating that participants’ water intake returned to normal and that they used the water filters less frequently as the study progressed.
After adjusting for SG, the trend in total urinary As remained (Figure 3 ).

The proportions of urinary InAs, MMAs, and DMAs were not significantly different between the creatine and placebo groups at any follow- up (Dunnett’s ttestP>0.05).Treatment group differences in within-person change in urinary As metabolites between baseline and wk 1, 6, and 12 were examined with the use of available data from the 542 subjects, which included 1966 observations (wk 0: n=542; wk 1: n=456; wk 6: n=461; wk 12: n=507). The treatment effects on within-person changes in As metabolite proportions over the first 6 wk were similar to the effects on the changes over 12 wk, indicated by a linear model with 20 parameters where the time variable had 4 categories (wk 0, wk 1, wk 6, and wk 12).Therefore, data were described by a parsimonious model with 3 categories for the time variable (wk 0, wk 1, and wk 6 and 12).

FA supplementation significantly increased As methylation; at wk 6 and 12, there was a greater decrease in ln(%InAs) and %MMAs and increase in %DMAs among groups that had received 400 or 800 μg FA per day compared with placebo. The higher dose of FA had a greater effect on As methylation, as the decrease in %MMAs from baseline to wk 6 and 12 was larger in the 800FA group than in the 400FA group.Previously published findingsfromthistrialdemonstratedthatsupplementationof800 μg FA per day, but not 400 μg FA per day, decreased total blood As concentrations to a significantly greater extent than placebo (20).

FA supplementation were observed in a population that was predominantly folate sufficient (plasma folate ≥9 nmol/L in 80.2% of total participants).Although the study was powered to detect differences in the full sample of both folate-deficient and-sufficientindividuals,stratifiedanalysessuggestthatresults werenotdrivenbychangesamongparticipantswhowerefolate- deficient at baseline.At wk 12, the mean changes in percentage As metabolites were similar between the folate-deficient and - sufficient strata in the groups receiving FA supplementation.In the 400FA treatment group, the mean changes in As metabolite proportions for participants with baseline deficient ( n=31) and sufficient folate status ( n=102) were, respectively: ln(%InAs): −0.08,−0.04; %MMAs: −1.91,−1.98; %DMAs: 2.67, 2.25.
Similarly, in the 800FA treatment group, the mean changes for folate-deficient ( n=23) and -sufficient participants ( n=106) were, respectively: ln(%InAs): −0.07,−0.13; %MMAs: −1.96, −2.26; %DMAs: 2.83, 3.72. The results suggest that percentage of urinary As metabolites returned to baseline levels 12 wk after cessation of FA supple- mentation, as mean %InAs and %DMAs were not significantly different than baseline levels in those groups that discontinued FA supplementation.However, as previously reported, although blood As concentrations did increase after discontinuation of FA supplementation, the increase did not achieve statistical significance ( 20).In light of results regarding urinary As metabolites,thefollow-upperiodmaynothavebeenlongenough to observe a complete rebound in blood As after cessation of FA supplementation.Creatine supplementation moderately influenced the pro- portion of As metabolites in urine.
Although no significant differences were observed in the change in ln(%InAs) and %DMAs between the creatine and placebo groups at any timepoint, the decrease in %MMAs was significantly greater at wk 1 and wk 6 and 12 in the creatine group than in the placebo group. In previously published results, creatine supplementation did not affect total blood As ( 20).Our ap r i o r ihypothesis was that creatine supplementation would increase As methylation capacity by decreasing creatine biosynthesis, a major consumer of SAM methyl groups ( 14), and multiple studies have reported strong positive cross-sectional associations between urinary creatinine and As methylation capacity ( 15,18,21–24).In the current study, we also observed significant correlations between urinary creatinine and %InAs and %DMAs.
As we reported previously, supplementation of 3 g creatine per day did decrease creatine biosynthesis in this study population; concentrations of plasma guanidinoacetate, a precursor to creatine in the creatine biosynthetic pathway, significantly decreased with creatine supplementation, indicating a reduction in creatine biosynthesis ( 33). The current findings lend support to the hypothesis that a decrease in creatine biosynthesis achieved throughcreatinesupplementationmayinfluenceAsmethylation; however,themagnitudeoftheeffectsmaybesomewhattempered by long-range allosteric regulation of 1-carbon metabolism that regulates intracellular SAM concentrations.For example, SAM inhibits methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) (34), thereby decreasing synthesis of 5-MTHF and releasing 5-MTHF mediated inhibition of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) activity ( 35).
GNMT serves as a major regulator of SAM concentrations through utilization of SAM for the nonessential conversion of glycine to sarcosine ( 35,36). In an in silicoexperimentthatusedamathematicmodelofone-carbon metabolism, when creatine synthesis is set to 0, flux through GNMT increases by 30%.
And, SAM concentrations are further modulated through increased flux through the transsulfuration FOLIC ACID SUPPLEMENTATION AND ARSENIC METHYLATION 389TABLE 4 Summary statistics at wk 24 and mean within-person changes in As metabolite proportions by FA supplement groups1 400FA 800FA Wk 24 (Mean ±SD)Mean change (95%CI)(wk24– wk 12)Mean change (95%CI)(wk24– wk 0)Wk 24 (Mean ±SD)Mean change (95%CI)(wk24– wk 12)Mean change (95% C I )( w k2 4–w k0 ) ln(%InAs) Continued supplementation 2.51 ±0.37 −0.05 (−0.12, 0.03) −0.09 (−0.17,−0.02) 2.49 ±0.36 −0.01 (−0.09, 0.07) −0.12 (−0.19,−0.04) Discontinued supplementation 2.57 ±0.35 0.06 ( −0.03, 0.14) 0.01 ( −0.08, 0.09) 2.54 ±0.46 0.09 (0.00, 0.19) −0.02 (−0.11, 0.08) %MMAs Continued supplementation 11.76 ±4.04 0.31 ( −0.39, 1.02) −1.63 (−2.36,−0.90) 12.04 ±4.16 1.02 (0.31, 1.74) −1.27 (−2.01,−0.54) Discontinued supplementation 12.27 ±4.28 1.11 (0.46, 1.76) −0.83 (−1.52,−0.14) 12.24 ±5.00 1.82 (1.02, 2.63) −0.47 (−1.31, 0.37) %DMAs Continued supplementation 74.98 ±7.20 0.47 ( −0.82, 1.76) 2.81 (1.54, 4.08) 75.08 ±7.00 −0.91 (−2.24, 0.41) 2.66 (1.31, 4.01) Discontinued supplementation 73.80 ±7.07 −2.03 (−3.43,−0.63) 0.31 ( −1.08, 1.69) 73.88 ±7.96 −3.42 (−4.85,−1.98) 0.16 ( −1.27, 1.58) 1Mean within-person changes and 95% CIs were derived from parameters of the linear models with repeated measures for effect of rebound.

Additional unknown mechanisms may contribute to the strong cross-sectional associations between urinary creatinine and As methylation capacity.For example, it is possible that urinary creatinine is somehow related to renal tubular reabsorption of InAs, a topic that is relatively understudied in the scientific literature.As noted earlier, this study was powered to test the effects of FA and creatine supplementation on a population of mixed folate-deficient and -sufficient individuals.Significant effects were observed among folate-sufficient participants receiving FA supplementation.In addition, the trial focused on the effects of increasing the recruitment of methyl groups to enhance one- carbon metabolism.
However, As methylation capacity may also be altered by increasing the availability of other methyl donorsinvolvedinone-carbonmetabolism( 38).Furtherresearch is needed to explore the impact of cosupplementation of FA with other methyl donors, such as choline and betaine, and other micronutrients related to one-carbon metabolism, such as vitaminsB-12,B-2,andB-6.Furthermore,treatmenteffectsmay differ by baseline nutritional status of these micronutrients. The study limitations include poor compliance with water filter use over time and the possibility that some urine samples were diluted with water.However, it is unlikely that either of these factors differed between treatment groups owing to randomization, and therefore they are not expected to influence the study’s conclusions.
In conclusion, the importance of nutritional factors in mod- ifying As metabolism and toxicity has emerged over the past 2 0y(39), as well as the potential use of nutritional supplements to mitigate the health effects of chronic As exposure ( 40). Remediation of As exposure is the most important approach to limiting health effects ( 3); however, removal of As from drinking water may not be immediately feasible in all real- world situations and exposure to unsafe concentrations of As in drinking water persists in many regions of the world ( 1).Furthermore, adverse health outcomes associated with chronic Asexposurepersistafterexposurehasended( 41,42).Additional approaches to lower blood As, increase As methylation, and potentially reduce As toxicity are needed.In this trial, FA supplementationsignificantlyincreasedAsmethylationcapacity, resulting in an increased proportion of urinary DMAs, the least toxic and most readily excreted As metabolite.
A significant change in the proportions of InAs and DMAs was not observed in the creatine group, although findings suggest that creatine supplementation decreased %MMAs to a lesser extent than FA. Although these findings are informative, further research is needed to fully understand the strong cross-sectional relations previously observed between urinary creatinine and arsenic methylation ( 15,21,22,24).Nutritional interventions may conceivably reduce long-term health risks of As exposure.For example, folate deficiency has beenassociatedwiththesubsequentdevelopmentofskinlesions (43).
FA fortification of grains has been shown to dramatically decreasetheprevalenceoffolatedeficiency( 44,45)andhasbeen mandatedin87countries(46);however,Bangladeshisnotamong them.Countries with endemicAsexposure,suchasBangladesh, may benefit from FA fortification to reduce folate deficiency in general, and as a cost-effective method of partly reducing As toxicity as one component of comprehensive As mitigation programs. 390 BOZACK ET AL.We thank our staff, the fieldworkers, and the study participants in Bangladesh, without whom this work would not have been possible.The authors’ contributions were as follows—AKB and XL: wrote the paper and analyzed the data; MVG: designed the research; MNH and MVG: directed field staff in Bangladesh; FP, ABS, HS, MNU, TI, VI, JHG, and MVG: conducted the research; AKB, AML-L, MNH, XL, and MVG: had primaryresponsibilityforthefinalcontent;andallauthors:readandapproved thefinalmanuscript.Noneoftheauthorsreportedaconflictofinterestrelated to the study.
