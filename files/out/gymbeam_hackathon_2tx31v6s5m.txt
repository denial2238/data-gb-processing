Objective: To examine the effects of creatine supplementa- tion on the incidence of cramping and injury observed during 1 season of National Collegiate Athletic Association Division IAfootball training and competition.Design and Setting: In an open-label manner, subjects who volunteered to take creatine ingested 0.3 g´kg21´d21of creatine for 5 days followed by an average of 0.03 g´kg´21d21afterwork- outs, practices, and games.Creatine intake was monitoredandrecorded by researchers throughout the course of the study.Subjects: Thirty-eight of 72 athletes (53.0%) participating in the 1999 Division IA collegiate football season from the sameuniversity volunteered to take creatine in this study.Subjectstrained, practiced, or played in environmental conditions rang-ing from 15 8Ct o3 7 8C (mean 527.26 8610.93 8C) and 46.0% to 91.0% relative humidity (mean 554.17% 69.71%).
Measurements: Injuries treated by the athletic training staff were recorded and categorized as cramping, heat illness or de-hydration, muscle tightness, muscle strains, noncontact jointin-juries, contact injuries, and illness. The number of missed prac- tices due to injury and illness was also recorded.Data wereanalyzed using a 2 32x 2test to examine the ®rst reported incidences of cramping and injury for creatine users and non-users.Results: Creatine users had signi®cantly less cramping ( x2 1 55.35P5.021); heat illness or dehydration ( x2 154.09,P5 .043); muscle tightness ( x2 155.39,P5.020); muscle strains (x2 155.36,P5.021); and total injuries ( x2 1517.80,P,.001) than nonusers.There were no signi®cant differences betweengroups regarding noncontact joint injuries ( x 2 153.48,P5 .062);contactinjuries( x2 150.00,P5.100);illness( x2 156.82, P5.409);missedpracticesduetoinjury( x2 151.43,P5.233); or players lost for the season ( x2 154.75,P5.491).
Conclusions: The incidence of cramping or injury inDivision IAfootballplayerswassigni®cantlylowerorproportionalforcre-atine users compared with nonusers. Key Words: exercise, nutrition, ergogenic aids, safety, sport injuries Creatine supplementation has been reported to increase strength,1enhance work performed during repetitive sets of muscle contractions,2improve repetitive sprint performance,1and increase body mass/fat-free mass.1±3Con- sequently, creatine has become a very popular nutritional sup-plement among athletes.The only documentedsideeffectfromcreatine supplementation reported in the scienti®c and medicalliterature has been weight gain.
1±4However, concerns have been raised over the safety of creatine supplementation amongselect populations, although extensive research has yielded nonegative effects in the areas of endogenous creatinesynthesis, 5 renal and liver function,6±9muscle and liver enzyme ef¯ux,6,9 blood volume10,11and electrolyte status,11,12blood pressure,13 or general markers.3,6,7,9,13±15Additionally, only anecdotal re- ports have suggested that creatine supplementation during in- tense training in hot or humid environments may predisposeathletes to increased incidence of muscle cramping, dehydra-tion, or musculoskeletal injuries such as muscle strains, or acombination of these. 16±18Therefore, our purpose was to ex- amine the effects of creatine supplementation on the incidenceof dehydration and cramping and various musculoskeletal in-juries observed in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division IA football players during trainingandcom-petition.
This study was only conducted through the course of1 season due to the August 2000 NCAA restrictions regardingthe provision of ``muscle-building'' supplements (ie, creatine)to athletes. METHODS AND MATERIALSSubjects We monitored injury rates of 72 Division IA NCAA col- legiate football players at a Southern university during the1999 football season.Subjects who volunteered to participatein this study chose whether they wanted to take creatine- ornon-creatine±containing supplements (placebo) during trainingand competition.No subject reported taking additional ergo-genic supplements other than protein-carbohydrate shakes orprotein bars.
All subjects underwent preseason medical ex-aminations and were cleared to participate in football accord- Journal of Athletic Training 217First-Time Injuries, Illnesses, Missed Practices, and Players Lost for the Season Among Creatine-SupplementedandNonsupplemented NCAA Division IA College Football Players* Treated InjuryCreatine Users (n538) InjuriesNo InjuriesNoncreatine Users (n534) InjuriesNo Injuries CrampingHeat/dehydrationMuscle tightnessMuscle strainsNoncontact injuriesContact injuriesIllnessMissed practicesPlayers lost for seasonTotal10 49 1114381017 1 11428 3429272438282137 26618 10171920341220 2 15216 2417151434221432 188 *NCAA indicates National Collegiate Athletic Association.ing to NCAA guidelines. In addition, all athletes were provid- ed medical supervision by the team athletic training staff andphysicians throughout the observation period.
Subjects wereproperly informed as to the experimental procedures, and in-formed consent statements were signed in adherence with theguidelines of the university's internal review board for use ofhuman subjects, which also approved the study. Subjects were19.761.0 years of age (range, 18±24 years) and 183.0 69.0 cm tall (range, 159±202 cm) with mass of 105.0 618.0 kg (range, 72±140 kg) upon reporting to fall football camp forthe 1999 season.Procedures Injuries treated by the athletic training staff during the 1999 college football season were monitored during this study.Weaccomplished this by attending training sessions, practice ses-sions, and games and by recording all injuries treated by theathletic training staff.
To ensure that the injury was accuratelyrecorded, we con®rmed the type, category, and degree of in-jury with the athletic training staff when the injury occurred.Additionally, missed practices were tabulated to monitor thelength of time an athlete was unable to participate due to spe-ci®c injury. We also recorded any ``perceived'' negative sideeffects associated with creatine supplementation reporteddailyby the athletes.Injuries were categorized as cramping; heatdisorders (eg, dehydration, heat syncope); muscle tightness;muscle strains; noncontact joint injuries; contact injuries; ill-ness; and the number of missed practices due to injury.Theseinjuries were considered signi®cant injuries because they re-quired medical attention during or after training sessions,prac-tices, or games, and they involved limitationfromparticipationin the sport.
Minor injuries that did not limit the athlete's abil-ity to participate in practices and games or require signi®cantmedical treatment were not recorded. Supplementation Protocols Subjects who volunteered for the study chose whether they wanted to take creatine, and the remaining subjects had accessto a non-creatine±containing commercial sport drink, whichwas designated as the placebo.Creatine was added to sportsdrinks or water that the players ingested under the supervisionof research assistants after training sessions, practices, andcompetition during the 4-month period.Subjects also turnedin weekly logs to verify their compliance to the prescribedcreatine-dosage protocol.The 38 subjects who chose to takecreatine ingested, in an open-label manner, creatine monohy-drate (0.3 g/kg loading phase) for 5 days and 0.03 g/kg perday thereafter (115-day maintenance phase) based on a for-mula known to increase creatine concentrations in relation tothe athlete's body mass.
19Further, these speci®c creatine-dos- age protocols were selected based on previous research rec-ommendations. 19If a subject fell behind in taking creatine, he ingested double the maintenance dose the following day inorder to catch up (n 54 subjects on 2 occasions).Training Training consisted of resistance training and conditioning drills (1±2 h/d, 4 d/wk); fall football camp (3±6 h/d, 6-d/wk);and practicing and competition during football season (2±4h/d, 6 d/wk).Athletic coaches, certi®ed athletic trainers, andresearch assistants supervised all training sessions.Training averaged 127 665 minutes per session with an average in- tensity of 3.5 61 on a 1 to 5 scale, where 1 was equivalent to a walk-through practice before games and 5 was equivalentto game competition.Environmental conditions during train-ing and competition ranged from 15 8Ct o3 7 8C (mean 5 27.26 8C610.93 8C) and 46.0% to 91.0% relative humidity (mean 554.17% 69.71%).
Data Analyses The incidence of reported ®rst-time injuries observed incre- atine users and noncreatine users for each category was mon-itored and recorded during the study (Table). Injuries treatedby the athletic training staff were documented and categorized as cramping, heat illness or dehydration, muscle tightness,muscle strains, noncontact joint injuries, contact injuries, andillness.The number of missed practices due to injury or illnessand the total injuries were also recorded.Data were analyzedusing a 2 32x 2test to examine the incidence of reported ®rst-time cramping and injury occurrences for creatine usersand nonusers ( P,.05).RESULTS Only ®rst-time injuries were included in the x 2procedure in order to adhere to the nonparametric statistical assumptionof mutual exclusiveness, although select athletes were treatedfor different, multiple, and recurring injuries throughout thestudy.
If an athlete aggravated a previous injury (ie, sprainedankle) that occurred before the season, it was not recorded forthe purposes of this study. Creatine users had signi®cantly lesscramping ( x 2155.35,P,.021); heat illness or dehydration (x2154.09,P5.043); muscle tightness ( x2155.39,P5 .020); muscle strains ( x2155.36,P5.021); and total injuries (x21517.80,P,.001) than nonusers.No signi®cant differ- ences were noted between groups regarding noncontact jointinjuries ( x 2153.48,P5.062); contact injuries ( x2150.00, P5.100); illness ( x2156.82,P5.409); missed practices due to injury ( x2151.43,P5.233); and players lost for the season ( x2154.75,P5.491).218Volume 38 xNumber 3 xSeptember 2003DISCUSSION Anecdotal reports have suggested that creatine supplemen- tation may promote dehydration, cramping, and musculoskel-etal injury.
4,20Because many of these reports have emanated from certi®ed athletic trainers and coaches, these conditionsare commonly described as side effects from creatine supple-mentation. 4,20As a result, some certi®ed athletic trainers and coaches have restricted the availability of creatine to their ath-letes (particularly during intense training periods performed inthe heat), and some have warned against the use of creatineuntil more long-term data demonstrate its safety.In addition,some athletic organizations (eg, NCAA) have banned the prac-tice of allowing teams to ``provide'' creatine to their athletes,citing safety and fairness issues, although athletes are still al-lowed to take creatine.We found that creatine use among Di-vision IA football players training and competing in hot andhumid environments did not signi®cantly promote dehydra-tion, cramping, or muscle injury in comparison with athleteswho did not take creatine.
Moreover, the athletes did notreporta consistent pattern of ``perceived'' negative side effects as aresult of the creatine-supplementation protocol. Within thescope of this study, these ®ndings add to the growing body ofevidence that creatine supplementation does not cause the an-ecdotally reported side effects and, to date, does not appear tocause health problems.6±9,14,15 Among the most commonly reported anecdotal side effects associated with creatine supplementation have been an in-creased incidence of dehydration or muscle cramping and de-creased heat tolerance.In this regard, some have suggestedthat since creatine supplementation may increase work capac-ity, athletes who take creatine during training in hot and humidenvironments may experience a greater rate of dehydration,muscle cramping, or heat illness (or all 3).
21It also has been suggested that creatine ingestion promotes ¯uid retention,which may alter electrolyte status and promote muscle cramp-ing by interfering with the muscle's contraction-relaxationmechanisms. 4,21Over the last few years, a number of research- ers11,21have examined the effects of creatine supplementation on hydration status, electrolyte levels, and dehydration duringexercise performed in the heat and found that creatine doesnot promote dehydration, alter electrolyte levels, or increasethermal stress.In addition, there has been no evidence thatcreatine supplementation promotes muscle cramping amongathletes.11,16,22In fact, recent ®ndings indicated that creatine supplementation may actually promote hydration,11,23reduce thermal stress during exercise in the heat,11,22and possibly reduce the incidence of injury.15,16,22Our results suggest that the incidence of cramping and dehydration observed amongcreatine users was signi®cantly lower than among nonusers.
Anecdotal reports have also suggested that creatine may promote a higher incidence of muscle injuries, such as musclestrains. 4,17Proponents of this theory postulated that because creatine supplementation may promote rapid increases instrength and body mass, the athlete may be more predisposedto additional stress placed on muscles, bones,joints,ligaments,and connective tissues.In our investigation, the incidence ofmuscle tightness, muscle strains, and total injuries was signif-icantly lower among creatine users than among nonusers.There was also no evidence of a signi®cant differencebetweencreatine users and nonusers regarding the incidence of illness,missed practices, and players lost with a season-ending injury.If creatine supplementation increased the incidence of theseproblems, the incidence of injury among creatine users should have been markedly higher than among nonusers.
However,the incidence of injury among athletes who took creatine dur-ing training was similar to or lower than that of athletes nottaking creatine. It might be argued that creatine supplemen-tation appeared to allow the athletes to tolerate training to agreater degree and, thereby, lessened the incidence of injury.These ®ndings are similar to recent reports that creatine sup-plementation during training may lessen injury rates amongathletes 15,16,22or hasten recovery after immobilization inju- ry.24Speci®cally, in a closely related study,22investigatorsex- amined the effects of creatine supplementation on crampingand injury occurrence in 100 Division IA football playersovera 3-year period.The incidence of cramping, dehydration, mus-cle tightness, muscle strains, noncontact injuries, and contactinjuries among creatine users was similar to or lower thanamong nonusers.There was also no evidence of a greater pro-portion of individual injuries (eg, hamstring strains, groinstrains, etc).
Moreover, the incidences of illness, missed prac-tices, and total injuries and the 1 player lost with a season-ending injury among the creatine users were similar to or low-er than among the nonusers. The results of this 3-yearinvestigation are closely related to the ®ndings in our study.In summary, our preliminary analysis suggests that colle- giate football players who took creatine during training andcompetition did not experience a greater incidence of dehy-dration, cramping, or injury in comparison with collegiatefootball players not taking creatine.Although athletes whotake creatine during intense training may experience some ofthese problems, the incidence of these problems was similarto or lower than among athletes not taking creatine in thisstudy.Therefore, our ®ndings may help to dispel anecdotalmyths suggesting that creatine supplementation may increasethe incidence of dehydration, cramping, or injury among ath-letes.
In addition, we hope that these ®ndings may help pro-fessionals involved in the training and medical supervision ofathletes (ie, athletic coaches, certi®ed athletic trainers, re-searchers, certi®ed strength and conditioning coaches, nutri-tional consultants, administrators, athletic governing bodies)tobetter examine the methods employed to train and manageathletes (ie, 3-a-day training in extreme climates, exhaustiveconditioning drills, hydration practices, etc). In this regard, itappears that the type of activities and conditions in which ath-letes are asked to train and compete may place them at a great-er risk of dehydration, cramping, or injury than creatine sup-plementation.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the athletes who participated in this study and the coach- es who allowed us to conduct this research.
