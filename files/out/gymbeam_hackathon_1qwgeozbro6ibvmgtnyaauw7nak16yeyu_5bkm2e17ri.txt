Our results indicate that hydrolysis signi ﬁcantly increased the cell proliferation of the WP fractions, with the lower-polarity fractions showing greater e ﬃcacy in this regard. Our results indicate that hydrolysis signi ﬁcantly increases cell proliferation of the WP fractions.Additionally, we con ﬁrmed di ﬀerences in the antioxidant activity of the WP fractions as a function of polarity was con ﬁrmed via scavenging 2,2 ’-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6- sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay in vitro .WP itself did not show anti-in ﬂammatory e ﬃcacy.However, all the hydrolyzed fractions downregulated the mRNA expression levels of in ﬂammatory cytokines in all treated cell lines and, based on a senescence-associated (SA)- β-galactosidase assay, the fraction with the lowest polarity (F6) inhibited cellular senescence to the greatestextent.Furthermore, we identi ﬁed the peptide sequences with various physiological activities from whey protein hydrolysates through mass spectrometry.
Taken together, our results indicate that the fractionation of WP via hydrolysis generates novel functions including promoting cellular cell proliferation, anti-in ﬂammatory e ﬀects, and enhancing antioxidant and anti-cellular senescence.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 25 April 2022 Revised 16 September 2022 Accepted 21 September2022 KEYWORDS milk; whey protein; hydrolysis; in ﬂammation; cellular senescence Introduction Milk is considered a nutritionally important food given that it contains essential nutrients for the body, such as proteins, calcium, and minerals (Paul et al. 2020).It is also well known that the continuous intake of calcium and the essential amino acids in milk prevent obesity (Abreu et al.2012; Satija et al.2013), type 2 dia- betes, and hypertension (Martini and Wood 2009; McGrane et al.2011).Moreover, the proteins in milk (80% casein protein and 20% whey protein (WP))(Jeong et al.
2021) are known to be e ﬀective in enhan- cing gastrointestinal activity, function, and immunity (Stelwagen et al. 2009; Maldonado Galdeano et al.2011).Furthermore, the amino acids absorbed following the breakdown of casein protein via digestion increase muscle mass and suppress hunger (Scognamiglio et al.2004), and WP, which predominantly consists of α-lactalbumin ( α-LA), β-lactoglobulin ( β-LG), immunoglo- bulin (Ig), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Smithers et al.1996), is digested and converted into amino acids faster after ingestion than casein protein (Koopman et al.2009).WP is rich in the essential amino acids cysteine and methionine as well as in branched-chain amino acidsand tryptophan (Hulmi et al.2010).Thus, it exhibits various physiologically active functions, such as choles-terol control and strengthening immune systemstrengthening (Badr et al.2012; Niitsu et al.2016; Bell et al.2020).
Speciﬁ cally, cysteine, which is one of the constituent amino acids of glutathione, is involved inthe body ’s antioxidant and immune systems (Iyer et al. 2009), and reportedly plays a critical role in the elderly who have reduced muscle mass and muscle strength due to insu ﬃcient protein intake (Bell et al.2020).© 2022 The Author(s).Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.SIGNALING & BIOMOLECULES CONTACT Kee K.

As a repre- sentative example, a bioactive peptide derived from buﬀalo casein, VLPVPQK, shows anti-aging and anti- osteopenic e ﬀects (Mada et al. 2017).Cells, the basic functional units of all living organisms, are exposed to various internal and external stressors, when subjected to environmental changes, they regulate various physiological responses to maintain homeostasis,w h i c hi fd i s r u p t e d ,r e s u l t si nt h eo c c u r r e n c eo fm a n yd i s - eases (Ishikawa et al.2008).For example, during the oxi- dative phosphorylation process for ATP production in mitochondria, free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce cellular oxidative stress, are generated (Sosa et al.2013; Zorov et al.2014;R o d n e ye ta l .2016).
These ROS then induce the denaturation of biomoleculesvia irreversible chemical react ions with various biomole- cules, resulting in the occurrence of various diseases,such as those associated with in ﬂammatory responses and accelerated aging (Cai and Harrison 2000;N u n o m u r a et al. 2001; Trachootham et al.2009 ).Therefore, antioxi- dants externally supplied through food may be necessaryto eliminate excessive free radicals and ROS production.In this study, we analyzed the diversity and e ﬃcacy of the physiological activity of WP fractions hydrolyzedusing the digesting enzyme pancreatin.Speci ﬁcally, the hydrolyzed WP fractions were separated based on peptide polarity and their bioactivities to di ﬀerent cell lines were investigated.Materials and methods Preparation of hydrolyzed WP and peptides For WP hydrolysis, pancreatin (Bision Co.Ltd., Gyunggi- do, Korea) was added to WP at a ratio of 1:100.
Thereafter, they were allowed to react for 5 h at 50°C in a shaking incubator (130 rpm) after which the hydrolysate was cen-trifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min at 40°C. This WP hydroly-sate was then analyzed using a reversed-phase HPLC system (Waters Associates, Milford, MA., USA) with a C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Vydac, Hesperia, CA., USA)equilibrated with solvent A (0.1% tri ﬂuoroacetic acid [TFA] in deionized water) and eluted with a linear gradientof solvent B (0.1% TFA in acetonitrile) for 40 min.Theexperiment was performed at 25°C with the HPLC system at a ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min, and the absorbance of the column elute was measured at 214 nm.Addition- ally, the hydrolyzed WP fractions (F1 –F6) were alsoanalyzed using a Multi Preparative HPLC system (YMC, Kyoto, Japan) with a C18 column (250 × 20.0 mm, YMC) equilibrated with solvent A and eluted with a linear gradi-ent of solvent B for 60 min.
The experiment was per- formed at 25°C using at a ﬂow rate of 15 mL/min, and the absorbance of the column elute was measured at 214 nm. The hydrolyzed WP fractions were obtainedbased on the acetonitrile concentration (1 –31%).The components of F6 were analyzed using liquid chromato-graphy-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in an EASY-nLC 1000system (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc Inc., MA, USA).The peptide sequence present in the protein sequence data(NCBI) was con ﬁrmed using MASCOT (Matrix Science, London, U.K.; version 2.2.04).Peptides with signi ﬁcance were considered and analyzed using the MASCOT scorevalue.Peptides identi ﬁed in F6 of hydrolyzed WP were synthesized by Peptron, Inc.(Daejeon, South Korea).
Cell culture and reagent Human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, human liverhepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, murine macro- phage cell line RAW 264.7, and primary human dermal ﬁbroblast (HDF) cell line (Cell Applications, San Diego, CA, USA) were maintained in Dulbecco’ s modi ﬁed Eagle ’s medium (DMEM; Welgene, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetalbovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Waltham, MA., USA) and 1%penicillin/streptomycin (Corning Inc., Corning, NY., USA) at 37°C in a humid 5% CO 2atmosphere. Resveratrol was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO., USA), and the senescence-associated- β-galactosidase (SA- β- gal) staining kit was purchased from Cell Signaling Tech-nology (Beverly, MA., USA).ABTS radical scavenging activity The antioxidant activities of the WP fractions weremeasured using the 2,2 ’-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazo- line-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay (Cambronero-Urena et al.2021).
Speciﬁ cally, the ABTS + radical solution was prepared by reacting a 7 mM ABTS solution with 2.4 mM potassium persulfate solution at 25°C for 24 h. The hydrolyzed WP was then reacted with the prepared ABTS + radical solution for 4 min, after which the absor-bance was measured at 650 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices.San Jose, CA., USA).Antioxi- dant activity was calculated using the followingequation: ABTS radical scavenging activity (%) = Acontrol−Asample Acontrol[] ×100ANIMAL CELLS AND SYSTEMS 233 Where Ais the absorbance of ABTS radical in distilled water; Ais the absorbance of an ABTS radical solution mixed with sample.Cell proliferation measurement Cell proliferation was determined via MTS assay.A549, HepG2, and RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at 3,000 cellsper well in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h.There- after, the cells were treated with hydrolyzed WP fractions at concentrations of 0.05, 0.25, and 1.25 mg/mL followedby incubation for 36 h.
Cell proliferation was then ana- lyzed using a Cell Titer 96R Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WA., USA), andabsorbance was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Finally, mitochondrial activity cell proliferation was calculated using the follow-ing equation: Cell proliferation (%) = Asample Acontrol[] ×100 RNA isolation and quantitative RT –PCR (qRT- PCR) analysis RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at 1 × 105cells per well in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h.Thereafter, the cellswere treated with the hydrolyzed WP fractions and incu- bated for 30 h followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment at a concentration of 1 μg/mL for 6 h.Total RNA was then isolated from the RAW 264.7 cells using the GeneAll Hybrid-R RNA Puri ﬁcation Kit (GeneAll, Seoul, Korea).
Thereafter, cDNA was synthesized using a random hexamer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase(Promega), and qRT-PCR was performed using the AriaMx real-time PCR system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA., USA) (Jung et al. 2022).The primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary table 1.Senescence-associated-β -galactosidase (SA- β- gal) activity analysis HDFs were seeded at 2 × 105cells per well in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h.This was followed by pre-treatment with 1.25 mg/mL of the hydrolyzed WP frac-tions and incubation for 24 h.Thereafter, senescence was induced via treatment with 600 μMH 2O2for 2 h, and the cells were allowed to recover for a period of 4 days.After washing twice with PBS, the cells were ﬁxed with 1× ﬁxative solution, and SA- β-gal staining was performed using a senescence- β-galactosidase staining kit (Cell Signaling Technology).
Finally, theH2O2-treated HDFs were photographed using a light microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and the number of X-gal-stained cells was counted against the totalnumber of HDFs and expressed as a percentage of SA-β -gal-positive cells. Statistical analysis Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).All experiments were independently performed in tripli- cate, and statistical signiﬁ cance was determined using the Student ’s t-test.* p< 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.Results HPLC chromatogram of hydrolyzed WP Pancreatin is a mixture of carbohydrates, lipids, and protein-digesting enzymes.Speci ﬁcally, it contains various proteases, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, elas- tase, and carboxypeptidase A and B (Rothenbuhler and Kinsella 1986).The complex action of these pancreatin enzymes produce various types of degradation productsfrom their substrates.
Via enzymatic hydrolysis and frac- tionation as determined using a multi-preparative HPLC system (repeated six times), we determined the func-tionality of the hydrolysate produced by the action of pancreatin on WP ( Figure 1 (A)), and separated the hydrolyzed WP-driven peptides based on their polarity via multi-preparative HPLC led to the observation of several peaks ( Figure 1 (B,C)). Six reproducible peaks were selected from repeated trials, and fractions were obtained at each detected acetonitrile concentration (F1, 1%; F2, 3%; F3, 15%; F4, 20%; F5, 25%; and F6, 31%).Further, each of the six fractions obtained was dia-lyzed against water to remove acetonitrile, and there-after, freeze-dried, and stored at −20°C until later use.
Enhancement of the cellular cell proliferation of WP via hydrolysis To examine whether hydrolysis in ﬂuenced the e ﬀect of WP on cell proliferation, the e ﬀects of the treatment of diﬀerent cell lines with the hydrolyzed WP fractions at concentrations of 0.05, 0.25, and 1.25 mg/mL for 36 h were determined via MTS assay. No changes in the cell proliferation in the di ﬀerent cell lines were observed fol- lowing the F1, F2, and F3 WP treatments.However, the F6 treatment induced an increase in cell proliferation in all the treated cell lines, whereas the F5 treatment enhanced cell proliferation only in the HepG2, RAW264.7, and A549 cell lines ( Figure 2 (A-C).Further, the234 H.JUNG ET AL.F4 treatment enhanced cell proliferation in HepG2 cells only.These results suggest that cell proliferation enhan- cing peptides can be generated via the hydrolysis of WP.
Antioxidant activity of hydrolyzed WP ROS are unstable high-energy, and highly reactive mol- ecules that contain oxygen atoms and unpaired elec-trons. When their levels exceed a particular threshold in cells, they eventually inhibit cell homeostasis by attacking biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins,and lipids, and ROS-induced decline in cellular functioncauses various diseases, including aging (Kikuchi et al.2002; Kennedy et al.2005; Nunomura et al.2006).Therefore, we examined the antioxidant activity of the hydrolyzed WP fractions against free radicalscavenging activity via ABTS assay.Resveratrol, which is known to show antioxidant activity, was used a posi-tive control.We observed that the antioxidant activities of WP fractions at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL were similar to those of resveratrol at 25 and 50 μM concentrations, respectively.
Additionally, at aconcentration of 5.0 mg/mL, treatments F1, F2, andF3 showed excellent radical scavenging activities (95.7 ± 1.60, 93 ± 0.98, and 76.9 ± 4.36%, respectively) (Figure 3 (A)). Even though the treatment with F4, F5, or F6 showed lower antioxidant activities than the other fractions, our results indicate that their concen- tration-dependent increase in radical scavengingactivity was comparable to those of the other hydro- lyzed WP treatments.Anti-in ﬂammatory activity of hydrolyzed WP Considering the role of ROS in in ﬂammation in cells, the increase in the antioxidant activity of WP following hydrolysis inspired us to investigate its e ﬃcacy for inﬂammatory reactions.To this end, the expression levels of the mRNAs of representative in ﬂammatory cytokines, TNF- αand IL-6, and a nitric oxide-generating enzyme, iNOS, were examined in RAW 264.7 cells (Dinar- ello2000).
We observed that WP treatment upregulated the LPS-induced increase in the expression levels of the mRNA of in ﬂammatory cytokines; however, all the Figure 1.

These results suggest that it is poss- ible to obtain fractions containing anti-inﬂ ammatory peptides from WP via hydrolysis.Suppression of cellular senescence by hydrolyzed WP The antioxidant and cell proliferation enhancing e ﬀects of the hydrolyzed WP fractions prompted us to examine whether these hydrolyzed WP fractions a ﬀected cellular senescence. In this regard, we used the well-known bio- marker, SA- β-gal, to detect senescent and aging cells and conﬁrm the degree of cellular senescence.As expected, H2O2treatment eﬀ ectively induced the senescence of HDFs by increasing the number of β-gal-positive cells (Figure 5 ).Further, we observed that treatment with WP and F1 –F5 reduced the proportion of β-gal-positive cells from approximately 25 –12.5%.Interestingly, the decrease in the proportion of β-gal-positive cells by F6 treatment was con ﬁrmed to be 5%, i.e.
less than 12.5% indicating that it suppressed senescence induced by H 2O2.T h i s infers that the F6 treatment showed more e ﬀective inhibi- tory activity than the basal level of cellular senescence even in the induction of cellular senescence by the H 2O2treat- ment. Therefore, hydrolysis can enhance the inhibitoryactivity of WP on cellular senescence.Physiological activity of peptides identi ﬁed in F6 We performed LC-MS analysis to identify the peptides ofF6 that showed signiﬁ cant antioxidant and anti-agingFigure 2.Eﬀect of hydrolyzed WP on cell proliferation.(A) A549, (B) HepG2, and (C) RAW 264.7 cells treated with the indicated con- centrations of hydrolyzed WP for 36 h.Cell proliferation was measured via MTS assays.The results are presented as mean ± S.E.M relative cell proliferation compared with the control group.*p < 0.05 , compared with non-treated control.Figure 3.Antioxidant activity of hydrolyzed WP.

In both HepG2 and RAW 264.7 cells, which showed a substantial increase in cell proliferation by F6 ( Figure 2 ), P2 showed the highest activity, whereas P1 increased cell prolifer-ation only in HepG2 cells ( Figure 6 (A,B)). The radical scavenging activities of P1 and P2 were similar to theconcentration-dependent increase of F6.Furthermore,to con ﬁrm the contribution of P1 and P2 to the anti- inﬂammatory activity of F6, we examined the inhibitory activity of P1 and P2 on IL-1 βand IL-6 and found that F6 had a marked inhibitory e ﬀect on in ﬂammatory cyto- kines.we examined P1 and P2 for their e ﬀects on IL-1β and IL-6 gene expression and found that both P2 hada marked inhibitory e ﬀect on in ﬂammatory cytokines.As a result, P1 showed no inhibition of the expression of both in ﬂammatory cytokines induced by LPS, whereas P2 showed signiﬁ cant inhibitory activity on the expression of IL-1 βand IL-6 ( Figure 6 (D,E)).
Finally, in order to determine the activity of P1 and P2 on cellularsenescence, we investigated the inhibitory e ﬀect on cel- lular senescence induced by H 2O2treatment. Despite weaker e ﬀect than F6, approximately 50% of inhibitory activity against cellular senescence was con ﬁrmed inboth P1 and P2 ( Figure 6 (F,G)).These results suggest that both P1 and P2 considerably contribute to theeﬀects of hydrolyzed WP on various physiological activi- ties, including anti-cellular senescence.Discussion In this study, we obtained WP fractions via hydrolysisbased on fractionation according to polarity and investi-gated the physiological activity of these fractions.WP is rich in essential amino acids, such as cysteine and meth- ionine, and is known to have various advantages, such asimmune regulation (Badr et al.2012), weight loss (Pezeshki et al.2015), and blood sugar control (Hussein et al.2020).
In our previous study, we con ﬁrmed that β-lactoglobulin, which accounts for 50 –55% of WP, inhi- bits cellular senescence by inhibiting oxidative stress in cells (Kim et al. 2019).The hydrolysates of WP have the same amino acid composition as WP; however, they absorb plasma amino acids faster than WP, promote insulin secretion, lower blood sugar levels, and enhance muscle growth (Moro et al.2019).Although several studies have reported the e ﬀect of WP on the physiological activity of cells, the number of studiesfocusing on the e ﬀects of WP hydrolysates is limited (Lollo et al.2011).To maximize the positive e ﬀects of the physiological activity of WP hydrolysates, the enrich- ment of the bioactive components via fractionation is essential, as con ﬁrmed in this study.Speciﬁ cally, to maximize the e ﬃcacy of physiological activity, we hydrolyzed WP via the action of the enzymemixture pancreatin, and obtained WP fractions as a func-tion of the polarity of the constituent peptides.
Our results indicated that fractions with low peptide polarity, especially F6 with the lowest polarity, signiﬁ cantly enhanced cell proliferation in all the cell linesTable 1.

JUNG ET AL.investigated ( Figure 2 ).These results suggest that hydrolysis induces a decrease in the polarity of the pro- teins constituting WP, and that peptide molecules withlow polarity can promote the cell proliferation of cells.Additionally, in terms of the antioxidant activity of the WP-derived peptide fractions, we observed that frac-tions containing low-polarity molecules exhibited stron- ger antioxidant activity than higher-polarity fractions.Additionally, in terms of the antioxidant activity of theWP-derived peptide fractions, we observed that frac- tions containing low-polarity molecules exhibited more potent antioxidant activity than higher-polarity frac-tions.Therefore, the di ﬀerential antioxidant activity of fractions owing to di ﬀerences in polarity is a factor to consider in the application of WP hydrolysates.
Given that in ﬂammatory response is one of the causes of various human diseases, proper in ﬂammatory control is essential for the prevention and treatment of diseases.Speciﬁ cally, treatment with WP had little e ﬀect on the LPS-induced expression of in ﬂammatory cytokines in macrophages. However, treatment with all the WPhydrolysate fractions e ﬀectively suppressed the LPS-induced expression of in ﬂammatory cytokines.Moreover, F6, the fraction with the lowest polarity, inhib-ited cellular senescence ﬁve times more e ﬀectively than WP.Our results con ﬁrmed the excellent anti-inﬂ amma- tory and anti-cellular senescence e ﬀects of low-polarity fraction-contained peptides.The radical scavenging activity of a peptide is aﬀected by the hydrophobic amino acids constituting the peptide.Among the hydrophobic amino acids,methionine (M), proline (P), cysteine (C), alanine (A), glycine (G), valine (V) and leucine (L) are known to have a high radical scavenging ability.
Further, lysine(K) at the C-terminus of the peptide improves the anti- oxidant ability (Zhu et al. 2013; Huang et al.2017).The Figure 6.Physiological activities of WP hydrolysates-derived peptides P1 and P2.(A) HepG2 and (B) RAW 264.7 cells treated with the indicated concentrations of VLVLDTDYKK (P1) and VGINYWLAHK (P2) for 36 h.Cell proliferation was measured by MTS assays.***p < 0.001 , compared with the non-treated control.(C) Radical scavenging activity of P1 and P2 measured at the indicated concentrations using an ABTS + radical scavenging assay.Resveratrol was used as the positive control.(D,E) RAW 264.7 cells were treated with P1 and P2 for 36 h and thereafter, treated with LPS to induce an in ﬂammatory response.The mRNA expression levels of (D) IL-1 β, (E) IL-6 were measured by qRT-PCR.The results are presented as mean ± S.E.M.*p < 0.05 ,***p < 0.001, compared with the respective LPS-treated controls.

LC-MS analysis con ﬁrmed that P2 accounted for 16% of the various peptidesincluded in F6 ( Table 1 ). In order to con ﬁrm the contri- bution of the quantitative composition to various cellu- lar activities of P2 in F6, when radical scavenging activity was compared representatively, at 5 mg/ml F6, about 55% ( Figure 3 ), 0.84 mM (1 mg/ml) P2 at about 15% ( Figure 6 ) activity was con ﬁrmed.These results indicate that P2 containing 16% in 5 mg/mlF6 was 0.8 mg/ml, and about 27% or more of thetotal radical scavenging activity of F2 was attributedto P2.The cell proliferation and radical scavenging activity of P2 can suppress cellular senescence and inﬂammatory responses caused by ROS, however, further studies on the molecular mechanisms under- lying its activity through binding proteins and cell receptors are needed.Overall, these results show that the hydrolysis of WP confers anti-inﬂ ammatory and anti-aging properties on a diversity of peptide molecules.
Conclusion In this study, we investigated the e ﬀects of hydrolysis, which increases the diversity of the bioactive peptidesin WP, on several physiological activities of WP fractions. Reportedly, excessive oxidative stress causes various human diseases, including age-related diseases;(Kikuchi et al.2002; Kennedy et al.2005; Nunomura et al.2006) however, the results of this study conﬁrmed that through hydrolysis, WP fractions with strong antioxidant activity can inhibit the generationof ROS more e ﬀectively than WP.Moreover, we demon- strated that the WP fraction with the lowest polarityexhibited excellent e ﬃcacy with respect to cell prolifer- ation, anti-inﬂ ammatory activity, and anti-aging activity.Therefore, the processing of WP fractions via hydrolysishas signiﬁ cance with respect to the discovery of novel bioactive functions and increasing the diversity of highly active bioactive peptides.
