The dietary energy intake, macronutrients, and vitamin E consumption were assessed through the 24 hr food recall method. Themalondialdehyde plasmatic concentration (MDA) was measured through the method of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances.Myeloperoxidase (MPO) was assessed through the oxidation speed of the o-dianisidine substrate in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured by a high-sensitivity immunoturbidimetry method.Results .The most common symptoms reported by the participants were sore throat, fever, and cough.Regarding the global nutritional statusevaluation, the majority of the sample had overweight.The dietary intake of vitamin E was 100 %inadequate and presented a mild correlation ( r=0.197) with MDA, a redox status marker.No correlation was observed among MPO, CRP, and the dietary intake of vitamin E.Conclusion .The dietary intake of vitamin E was related to MDA as the marker of redox status.1.
Introduction COVID-19, a contagious disease caused by the new corona- virus (SARS-CoV-2), is transmitted by respiratory dropletsor contact with contaminated surfaces and its incubation period varies from 1 to 14 days [1, 2]. The clinical manifesta-tions of COVID-19 vary from mild infections of the upperrespiratory tract to severe pneumonia, leading to a syndromeHindawi Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity Volume 2023, Article ID 8889213, 8 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/8889213 of serious acute respiratory discomfort.There are also accounts of symptoms such as headache, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, smell, and taste [3].
In addition, the new coronavirus activates the nicotin- amide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, causing an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, what may resultin oxidative stress and contribute to the in ﬂammatory responses that are activated by transcriptions factors, likeNF-kb, and exacerbated by the nucleotide-binding domainand leucine-rich repeat-containing family pyrin domain- containing 3 in ﬂammasome [4, 5]. Up to the present moment, there has been no effective treatment for the infection by the new coronavirus [6].Strengthening the immune systems by means of adequate nutritional status, along with a balanced diet, is likely to beessential in the ﬁght against the virus, due to the modulation of the in ﬂammatory process and the decrease in the occur- rence of oxidative stress [7].Among the nutrients with anti-oxidant and anti-in ﬂammatory properties that may aid in this process is vitamin E [8, 9].
This vitamin is present in the cell membrane, mainly in the cells of the immune system, with action in the differentiation of the immature T-cells in the t hymus [10]. The recommended intake of vitamin E directed to healthy adults, considering the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin E (in the form of α-tocopherol) is 15 mg/day for women and adult men.[11].Considering that lipid peroxidation is able to damage the membranes of the immune cells, vitamin E contributes tothe protection of those cellular membranes against oxidative attacks and ﬂuidity maintenance, integrity and functionality of the immunological cells [12].
Despite a possible adjuvant action of vitamin E to prevent the risk of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 through its immunomodulating and anti- oxidant functions, there are few studies on the intake of this vitamin among people infected with the new coronavirus.Hence, the present work assessed the vitamin E intake and its relationship with lipid peroxidation and C-reactive protein in patients with ﬂu symptoms and COVID-19 diagnosis. 2.Methods 2.1.Type of Study, Setting, and Sample.Cross-sectional study, which consists of a subproject of a macro project titled: “ran- domized clinical study of the effects of atazanavir, daclatasvir,and ivermectin in ambulatory patients with a positive resultfor COVID-19, ”performed in basic health units (BHUs) for the assistance to patients with symptoms of ﬂu syndrome, with suspicion and/or con ﬁrmed diagnosis of COVID-19, in the city of Teresina, capital of the state of Piau í, Brazil.
The research was conducted in adult participants, of bothsexes, who had had symptoms of ﬂu syndrome and a further diagnosis of COVID-19, undergoing ambulatory treatment inthe BHUs. The sample was determined by a nonprobabilistic meth- odology, conducted in patients who spontaneously attended two BHUs located in two different neighborhoods of the city of Teresina: East Zone (Planalto Uruguai) and South Zone(Parque Piauí ), from November/2020 to March/2021 (120 days).The choice of the BHUs was based on the fact that they are the ones with the highest amount of assistance among the 19 BHUs providing care for ﬂu syndrome with suspicion or con ﬁrmed diagnosis of COVID-19.2.2.Eligibility Criteria.
The study received patients aged 18 or older, of both sexes, with a diagnosis of COVID-19 con- ﬁrmed through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) made between the 3 rdand 7thdays of symptoms of ﬂu syndrome (fever, dry cough, dyspnea, thoracic pain, headache, loss of smell, and taste) in ambula-tory treatment. Exclusion criteria consisted of participants recommended with hospitalization in the ﬁrst medical appointment, preg- nant and lactating women, as well as those patients with aprevious diagnosis of H1N1, AIDS/HIV, epilepsy, chronic oracute pancreatitis, cancer, and hepatic and renal problems, and those making use of nutritional supplements.2.3.Recruiting and Data Collection.Patients who met the eligibility criteria and, upon orientations, consent to participate in the study responded to a social-economic questionnaire withclinical information.The participants also responded to a 24 hrrecall questionnaire.
The anthropometric measures of weight,height, and waist circumference (WC) were gauged. The researchcomprised patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis con ﬁrmed by means of positive RT-PCR testing and who did not receiveany medication such as azithromycin, atazanavir, daclatasvir,and ivermectin.2.4.Testing for the COVID-19 Diagnosis.Samples of naso- pharynx swab for RT-PCR were collected in 15 mL Falcon tubes in viral transport media by a quali ﬁed professional in the BHUs following the biosecurity recommendations.The detection of the SARS-CoV2 virus RNA was made with the RT-PCR technique using the StepOne plus equip- ment ( Applied Biosystems ).The ampliﬁ cation protocols were deﬁned according to the kit.The results were expressed as “detectable ”or“not detectable.”The exams were made at the “Dr.Costa Alvarenga ”Central Laboratory of Public Health (LACEN-PI).2.5.Anthropometric Assessment.
The anthropometric assess- ment was made by gauging weight (kg) and height (m), used for the assessment of the body mass index (BMI) and the classi ﬁcation of the global nutritional status was calculated according to cutting scores proposed for adults by the World Health Organization [13]. WC (cm) was measured with a ﬂexible and nonextensible measuring tape, positioned surrounding the natural line ofthe waist, on the average point between the last rib and the iliac crest [14].The classi ﬁcation of the values was performed according to the reference proposed for the Brazilian popu- lation, of both sexes, by the WHO [15].2.6.Evaluation of the Dietary Intake.Dietary intake was estimated through the 24 hr recall method applied on two nonconsecutive days during the diagnosis.
The patients wereinterviewed regarding food, beverages, and their amounts2 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity consumed over the 24 hr immediately before the interview, including the brands of the industrialized foods. Photograph albums with pictures of foods and servings were shown to assist in a more accurate measuring of the amounts con-sumed [16].The data obtained were analyzed regarding the energy and macronutrient contents with the Dietpro ®software 6.0 (2019).Adequation of the diet regarding macronutrients was assessed considering the recommendations proposed by the Institute of Medicine [11], as established in the acceptablemacronutrient distribution range (AMDR) and the vitaminE intake by the DRIs.In order to diminish errors of unexplained variability, such as intraindividual and interindividual, the multiplesource method proposed by Haubrock et al.[17] and Harttig et al.
[18] was applied, which uses a model of multiple regres- sion in function of covariables such as sex and age. 2.7.Assessment of the Lipid Peroxidation Biomarkers 2.7.1.Determination of the Malondialdehyde Plasmatic Concentration.The malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were determined by the production of thiobarbituric acid- reactive species, as described by Ohkawa et al.[19] with adaptations.In short, 200 µL of plasma was added to tubes containing acetic acid pH 3.5 and thiobarbituric acid 0.5 %, heated in a water bath at 85° C for 60 min.50 µL of 8.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate was added after a 15 min ice bath.The tubes were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm at 25 °C.The reading was performed on a spectrophotometer in the wavelengths of 532, 510, and 560 nm for the calculation of absorbance corrected to minimize the interference of boththe heme pigments and hemoglobin [20].The results wereexpressed in nmol of MDA per mL of plasma.2.7.2.
Determination of the Activity of Myeloperoxidase in the Plasma. The myeloperoxidase (MPO) plasmatic concentra- tions were determined based on the speed of oxidation of the o-dianisidine substrate in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) and veri ﬁed according to the change in absorbance [21].A mixture was prepared with 10 µL of plasma and 200 µL of reading solution composed by distilled water, phosphatebuffer (pH 6.0), hydrogen peroxide, and o-dianisidine.Thespeed of oxidation of o-dianisidine was controlled by follow-ing the increase in absorbance of the mixture after 1 min on a plate reader with 450 nm.The results were expressed as units of MPO per microliter of plasma (U/ µL).2.8.Assessment of the Serum Concentration of C-ReactiveProtein.The evaluation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) con- centration was performed by the high-sensitivity immuno-turbidimetry method, using ELISA kit (Labtest ®).The analysis was made according to the manufacturer ’s recommendations.
Values >5 mg/L were considered as indicators of the presence of inﬂammatory processes. 2.9.Data Analysis.Initially, the normality of the quantitative data distribution was assessed through Shapiro –Wilk test.The chi-square test was performed for categorical variablesof cardiometabolic risk represented by WC.In order to testthe relations among numerical variables with normal data distribution, Pearson ’s linear test of correlation was applied; for non-normal distribution, Spearman ’s test was applied.For all tests, p<0:05 was considered with a 95% conﬁ dence interval.The SPSS software for Windows ®, version 22.0 (2013), was used for statistical analysis.3.Results The sample was composed by 121 patients with positivediagnosis for COVID-19.Regard ing the social-economical characteristics of the patients included in this study, there wasap r e d o m i n a n c eo fm a l e s( 5 4 .5 %), mean age of 34.22 Æ10.4 years old.
Almost half the participants reported a monthly family income of one minimum monthly wage (42.1 %) and 52.9 % informed completed high school as educational status. Regu- lar practice of physical activity was informed by 41.3 %of the participants (Table 1).Regarding the clinical characteristics (Table 2), most of the study participants did not show noncommunicable dis-eases (80.2 %), nor did they make use of continuous medication (81.8%).The duration of the symptoms until an appointment at the BHU and the application of the RT-PCR test wasTABLE1: Social-economical characteristics of patients with ﬂu symp- toms assisted by basic health units and with a positive diagnosis for COVID-19 through RT-PCR; Teresina, Piau í, 2021.VariablesPositive COVID-19 ( n=121) No.

The most common symptoms reported were headache (68.6 %), fever (62.8% ), cough (61.2% ), and body pain (62 %).Table 3 shows the mean values and the standard deviations of anthropometric variables of the patients with COVID-19.Average body weight was 75.3 Æ17.53 kg and BMI of 26.91 Æ 5.88 kg/m2.Average BMI matched the presence of overweight (Table 3).
The average for WC was 89.22 Æ14.78 cm. When strati- ﬁed by sex, males presented high and very high risk of 24.4 % and 19.7 %, respectively, and females presented 20 %of high risk and 45.5 %of very high risk, revealing a statistically signif- icant difference when sex was compared ( p<0:05) (Table 3).Table 4 presents the dietary intake regarding energy, macronutrients, and vitamin E.The average energy intake of the study participants was 1,365.22 Æ315.85 kcal/day.For the macronutrients, the carbohydrates presented 77.6% of adequacy, proteins 100 %, and lipids 96.7 %.T h ea v e r a g ei n t a k e of vitamin E was 3.25 Æ1.64 mg/day.Table 5 shows the mean values of MDA and MPO in patients with COVID-19.Table 6 shows the correlationanalyses amongst numerical variables regarding the dietaryintake of vitamin E, lipids, saturated, monounsaturated andpolyunsaturated fats, lipid peroxidation markers, and CRP.
There was a moderate statistical correlation ( p≤0:001; r=0.483) between the vitamin E intake and the monounsat- urated fat intake, as well as a weak correlation between thetotal intake of lipids, polyunsaturated and saturated fats, and MDA (Table 6). In addition, upon the analysis of BMI, MPO, and the dietary intake of vitamin E (Table 6), therewas no statistically signi ﬁcant correlation ( p>0:05).4.Discussion This study was the ﬁrst to assess the intake of vitamin E and its correlation with the lipid peroxidation biomarkers inTABLE 2: Clinical characteristics of patients with symptoms of ﬂu syndrome assisted by basic health units and with a positive diagno- sis for COVID-19 through RT-PCR; Teresina, Piau í, 2021.VariablesPositive COVID-19 ( n=121) No.

The intake of this vitamin was inadequate in the analyzed sample.There was no rela-tionship between the insuf ﬁcient intake of vitamin E, MPO, and BMI.The intake of vitamin E presented a moderatepositive correlation with the intake of monounsaturated fats and a weak correlation with the intake of saturated, polyun- saturated fats, and MDA.The frequency of overweight was observed in this study and opposing to that, Filippo et al.
[22] observed that out of the 213 patients, 26.8 %(58) were patients that had been treated in an ambulatory level and that had healthy weight as the diagnostic nutritional status. Nutritional status seems to be a key factor for the diagnosis of COVID-19, since obesity is related to low-grade in ﬂamma- tion, with a decrease in immune response, increases the riskof serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and potential increase in the expression of the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), an enzyme that participates in the process ofentrance of the virus into the organism.These alterations par- tially account for the relationship between the excess of adipos- ity and the onset of more serious forms of the disease [23 –25].Regarding the energy intake and macronutrients, macro- nutrients were in accordance with the AMDR recommenda-tions.
This result may be considered positive for patientswith viral infections, such as COVID-19, since a balanced and diverse diet with protein rich foods, may contribute to the increase in the resistance to infections with the produc- tion of antibodies, in addition to contributing to an adequate nutritional status by helping to modulate the immune sys-tem, and oxidative stress and in ﬂammation pathways [26]. The assessment of the dietary intake of this study ’s participants, according to the values de ﬁned by the DRIs, showed a great probability of inadequacy in vitamin E intake.The dietary intake of vitamin E had a moderate correlation with the intake of polyunsaturated fats.It is highlighted that the intake of vitamin E is linked to the intake of lipids.Hence, a higher amount of polyunsaturated fats in the diet needs also a higher amount of this vitamin, since it increases the risk of oxidation due to the number of unsaturations of these fatty acids [27].
A weak correlation was found between the dietary intake of vitamin E and the MDA lipid peroxidation marker. This insufﬁcient ingestion values of vitamin E may contribute to aTABLE 4: Means values and standard deviations of energy, macronutrients, and vitamin E of patients with symptoms of ﬂu syndrome assisted by the basic health units with positive diagnosis for COVID-19 through RT-PCR; Teresina, Piau í, 2021.Variables MeanÆSD ( n=121) Adequation ( %) Energy (kcal/day) 1,365.22 Æ315.85 – Carbohydrates (g/day) 183.44Æ52.02 77.6 Proteins (g/day) 71.09Æ17.56 100 Lipids (g/day) 42.52Æ11.7 96.7 Polyunsaturated fats (g/day) 13.74Æ3.62 – Monounsaturated fats (g/day) 5.82Æ1.13 – Saturated fats (g/day) 10.95Æ1.91 – Vitamin E (mg/day) 3.25Æ1.64 – Note.Carbohydrates =45%–65%; proteins =10%–35%; lipids =20%–35%; Adequation ( %)=90%–110%; EAR: Vitamin E =15 mg/day [13].

A reason for the relation between the low intake of Vita- min E and higher lipid peroxidation is based on the fact that this vitamin has the role of maintaining the ﬂuidity of the membranes due to the participation in the modulation of theoxidative pathways of the eicosanoids and of the prostaglan- din synthesis, being able to neutralize ROS and nitrogen, as well as aiding in the immune response mediated by theT-cells [28].As for MPO, the other peroxidation marker used in this study, there was no relationship with MPO levels.
Among the possible reasons for missing the correlation with vitamin E intake, it should be noted that MPO is not directly involvedin lipid peroxidation; this enzyme participates in this processbecause it is a peroxidase that is stored in neutrophils, andthese cells, when activated, overproduce NADPH oxidase, resulting in increased production of superoxide anion and conversion into hydrogen peroxide [29]. Besides MPO notbeing a speci ﬁc marker, the fact that the average intake of vitamin E in the study group was much lower than the dailyrecommendation of 15 mg/day for adult men and women could also be a reason for the absence of correlation.Literature is still scarce regarding the studies on the lipid peroxidation biomarkers in patients with COVID-19, especially in an ambulatory level and due to that, no research was foundthat could compare such parameters with the present study.
Although the mechanisms involving the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the oxidative stress are not totally clear, oneof the possible mechanisms involved is related to the increasein NADPH oxidase. That happens because when the SARS-CoV-2 virus decreases the availability of ACE2, angiotensinII (Ang II) becomes available to interact with AT1R (receptor type 1 of Ang II), stimulating the activation of NADPH oxidase and inducing the increased production of ROS,including hydrogen superoxide and peroxide, as well as exac-erbated anti-in ﬂammatory responses, what contributes to more severity of the disease [30, 31].The participants of this study did not show values of serum levels of CRP that were indicative of the presence of in ﬂam- mation.Differently, Yang et al.[32] in a study of retrospectivecohort with hospitalized patients observed that patients withCOVID-19 presented increased levels of CRP, which is relatedto the severity of the disease.
It is believed that patients with increased levels of CRP in severe viral infections, such as COVID-19, are ﬁve times more likely to develop SARS [33]. In this context, CRP may have application as a sensitive serum marker of in ﬂammation and severe infection in COVID-19.When cells are infected by SARS-CoV-2, they recruit macrophages, causing an increase in the vascular per- meability as an acute-phase disease response.From then on,the death of infected cells occurs causing tissue damage,which, in turn, can lead to tissue hypoxia, and the triggeringof the immune system response contributes to the activation of a chain of proin ﬂammatory cytokines, a phenomenon known as a cytokine storm [34].
The exacerbated production of the markers of lipid per- oxidation and in ﬂammation is a normal characteristic of thephysiology of COVID-19; thus, an adequate intake of vita- min E must be assured to patients with COVID-19 with the aim of preventing nutritional de ﬁciencies and then, contrib- ute to boost the immune response, the antioxidant system and the ﬁght against in ﬂammations by means of the biologi- cal role of this vitamin.
The present study main limitations are: (1) a cross- sectional outlining limiting the inference of the results; (2) the nondetermination of the plasma concentration of vita- min E, what could bring complementary information to thedietary intake and to the nutritional status related to thisvitamin and to allow greater statistical power in the testswith the lipid peroxidation markers; (3) the reliability inthe dietary intake evaluation, due to the fact it depends onseveral factors, such as memory, what could underestimate this analysis, even with the corrections of inter- and intraper- sonal variability being performed; (4) more speci ﬁci nﬂam- matory markers, such as IL-6, were not determined, whichwere not analyzed due to operational dif ﬁculties.
However, this research can be considered as novel since it was conducted with patients assisted in BHUs with mild symptoms and still in the beginning of the disease, consider- ing the benchmark of the moment of the diagnosis with theuse of gold-standard tests for the disease diagnosis. In addi-tion, there is no suf ﬁcient evidence regarding the coronavirus disease, dietary intake, and oxidative stress markers.Giventhe long duration of the pandemic, the population had asigniﬁcant use of vitamin and mineral supplements, with or without medical prescription, that had no evidence sup-porting their ef ﬁcacy.Besides, the study was performed in a timeframe when there were still no vaccines and drugs withproven ef ﬁcacy for the treatment of the disease, being inter- rupted when new variants and vaccines began to be providedto the Brazilian population in general to prevent bias, and thus limiting the sample size.5.
Conclusion The dietary intake of vitamin E was weakly correlated with lipid peroxidation as determined by the content of MDA.In addition, there was a moderate correlation between the ingestion of this vitamin and monounsaturated fats, as well as a weak correlation with the ingestion of polyunsaturatedfats. No signi ﬁcant correlation was found between serum concentrations of CRP and vitamin E dietary intake.This study may be the starting point for new research on this novel subject.The assessment of the speci ﬁc nutritional recommendations would be of paramount importance forprevention, care, and treatment of microbial-based diseases.Data Availability Data will be available under request.Ethical Approval The research was conducted according to the guidelinesfrom the Resolution 466/12 of the National Health Council[35].The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee6 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity of the University Hospital (UH/UFPI) (No.
