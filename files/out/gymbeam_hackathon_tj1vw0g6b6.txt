Methods: Participants were drawn from 32 cohorts in the Environmental in ﬂuences on Child Health Outcomes Cohort Consortium. Children were born between 1999 and 2019 and part of ongoing follow-up with data available for analysis by August 2022.Exposures included self-reported maternal ﬁsh intake and ω-3/ﬁsh oil supplement use during pregnancy.Outcome measures included parent report of clinician-diagnosed ASD and parent-reported autism-related traits measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)-second edition ( n¼3939 and v3609 for ﬁsh intake analyses, respectively; n¼4537 and n¼3925 for supplement intake analyses, respectively).Results: In adjusted regression models, relative to no ﬁsh intake, ﬁsh intake during pregnancy was associated with reduced odds of autism diagnosis (odds ratio: 0.84; 95% con ﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.77, 0.92), and a modest reduction in raw total SRS scores ( β:/C01.69; 95% CI: /C03.3,/C00.08).
Estimates were similar across categories of ﬁsh consumption from “any”or“less than once per week ”to“more than twice per week. ”Forω-3 supplement use, relative to no use, no signi ﬁcant associations with autism diagnosis were identi ﬁed, whereas a modest relation with SRS score was suggested ( β: 1.98; 95% CI: 0.33, 3.64).Conclusions: These results extend previous work by suggesting that prenatal ﬁsh intake, but not ω-3 supplement use, may be associated with lower likelihood of both autism diagnosis and related traits.Given the low- ﬁsh intake in the United States general population and the rising autism prevalence, these ﬁndings suggest the need for better public health messaging regarding guidelines on ﬁsh intake for pregnant individuals.Keywords :ﬁsh,ω-3 supplement, pregnancy, autism, quantitative traits Introduction Autism spectrum disorder (ASD or, hereafter, autism) is a neurodevelopmental condition with an etiology that is complex and notwell-understood.
Evidence supports both genetic and environmental contributions to autism, including prenatal nutrition [ 1]. Maternal ﬁsh intake during pregnancy is a key source of essential nutrients, such asomega ( ω)-3 (n –3) PUFAs, critical for fetal brain development [ 2].In particular, ﬁsh is the primary source of the ω-3 PUFA DHA [ 3], the most abundant fatty acid in the brain, and may represent a modi ﬁable factor in the risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.However,evidence suggests that the ﬁsh and ω-3 PUFA intake in the United States is low [ 4,5].In results from nationally representative data [ 6], 95%–100% of pregnant and childbearing-age females consumed less than the recommended amounts of ﬁsh and DHA.However, in addition to neurodevelopmentally bene ﬁcialω-3 PUFAs, certain contaminants, including the known neurotoxicant methylmercury, are also present in some ﬁsh species, suggesting potential risks as well.
Although studies have supported the bene ﬁts of ﬁsh intake even after accounting for methylmercury exposure [ 7–12] and have not found associations be- tween methylmercury and autism [ 13,14], concerns regarding coex- posures may contribute to low intake [ 15] and reiterate the need for clarity in associations. A large number of studies have examined associations between maternal prenatal ﬁsh intake and child neurodevelopmental outcomes [10,16–19], with many suggesting that prenatal ﬁsh intake is generally associated with higher developmental and cognitive scores among offspring [ 12].However, not all studies have shown bene ﬁts, and few have addressed associations with autism.
Despite some supportiveﬁndings based on small samples and differing outcome assessments, a systematic review performed in support of the 2020 –2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans concluded that there is insuf ﬁcient evidence to determine whether seafood consumption during pregnancy is asso-ciated with risk of autism-like traits, behaviors, or diagnosis in children[12]. In addition, even fewer studies have shown associations of DHA or ω-3 supplements with autism outcomes [ 12,20].Given the gaps in our understanding of the relationships between key sources of PUFAs with autism and autism-related traits and theneed to identify modi ﬁable factors to reduce associated challenges in autism, we sought to examine these associations in a large United States sample.
Based on the biological importance of PUFAs in brain development [ 2], and associations with broader neurodevelopment, we hypothesized that both prenatal ﬁsh intake and ω-3 supplement use would be inversely associated with autism and related traits. Methods Study population The Environmental in ﬂuences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program is a large collaborative United States consortium focused onearly life environmental factors that impact child health [ 21,22].Brieﬂy, ECHO comprises 69 individual cohorts across the United States, whose participants follow a common protocol to assess theeffects of exposures on child-focused outcomes, including neuro- development.In this study, we analyzed data available from /C2032 co- horts that enrolled children born before 2019, to allow time forsymptom development and reporting of diagnosis, which typicallyoccurs after age 3 [ 23].
We included singleton births and excluded participants who were missing exposure or outcome information(Supplemental Figure 1 ). We allowed the sample size to vary across exposure-outcome analyses to maximize the sample size for eachanalysis.Following exclusions, analyses of associations with autismdiagnosis included 3939 individuals for ﬁsh intake and 4537 in- dividuals for ω-3 supplement use.Analyses of autism traits included 3609 individuals for ﬁsh intake and 3925 individuals for ω-3 supple- ment use.A list of cohorts contributing to these analyses is provided in Supplemental Table 1 ; 3 cohorts were drawn from samples that are considered at higher risk of autism owing to family history [ 24] (co- horts following younger siblings of a child with autism) or pretermbirth (which also increases the likelihood of autism) [ 25].The study protocol was approved by each cohort ’s local or the single ECHO institutional review board.
Written informed consent orparent/guardian permission was obtained along with child assent asappropriate, for ECHO-wide Cohort Data Collection Protocol partici-pation and for participation in speci ﬁc cohorts. This study followed the STROBE reporting guideline for cohort studies.K.Lyall et al.The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 120 (2024) 583 –592 584 Exposure information Information on maternal ﬁsh and seafood intake was collected across cohorts through validated semiquantitative or quantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), including the Block FFQ ( n¼6 cohorts) [ 26], the Harvard/Willett FFQ ( n¼2 cohorts) [ 27], the Dietary History Questionnaire ( n¼1 cohort) [ 28], and dietary screeners (remaining cohorts) (see the Supplemental Data for a list of ﬁsh and seafood items and assessment methods by cohort), with most cohortscollecting this information midpregnancy.
Fish and seafood intake wasdetermined according to responses on these questionnaires andharmonized by summing an individual ’s overall intake of servings across these questions and then categorizing servings as follows: noneor<once a month; >once per month but <weekly; weekly; and 2 or more servings per week. Information on ω-3 supplements was collected from maternal report on questionnaires, with most cohorts asking if DHA or ﬁsh oil supplements were used during pregnancy (yes/no) and a subset ( n¼20 cohorts, 42% of the participants) further querying frequency of use.The majority of cohorts collected information pro-spectively.Only 1 autism case –control study, ReCHARGE [ 29], was included ( Supplemental Table 1 ).Covariate information All information on covariates was collected via self-report ques- tionnaires.All covariates included in the current analyses wereharmonized in common categories by the ECHO Data Analysis Center.
Outcome information Autism diagnosis We de ﬁned autism diagnosis based on parent/caregiver report of physician-diagnosed ASD. In addition, several cohorts (including anautism case –control study and familial autism cohorts) ( Supplemental Table 1 ) used clinical assessments and gold-standard measures to conﬁrm an autism diagnosis.We excluded individuals missing infor- mation on autism diagnosis from the analyses of this outcome.Social Responsiveness Scale Autism-related traits were assessed using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)-second edition, one of the most widely used quantitativemeasures of the autism-related phenotype [ 30,31].The SRS is a 65-item informant-report tool yielding a continuous total score ranging from 0 to195, with higher scores indicating greater expression of the autismphenotype and greater social-communication de ﬁcits.
Scores can also be converted into normed T-scores (with a mean of 50 and SD 10) to facilitate clinical interpretation; scores >65 tend to be consistent with moderate ASD-related traits and those >75 with clinically impairing traits. The SRS has well-established psychometric properties, capturingtraits in both the general population and clinical settings [ 32,33], with high-internal validity, reliability, and reproducibility [ 31,34,35], and strong agreement with gold-standard diagnostic measures of autism [ 34, 35].Age-appropriate forms (preschool, school age, and adult) allow for trait measurement across a wide age range.A short form, including 16 ofthe 65 items, has also been developed using item response theory andvalidated in several samples [ 36,37].For this analysis, SRS forms were collected at ages 2.5 –18 y via parent/caregiver reports, and total raw scores were used as suggested by the publisher for population-level analyses.
Approximately 20% of the analytic sample used preschoolforms; 80% used school age forms; and 8% used 16-item SRS forms,with scores equated to full 65-item scores using equipercentile equating.Previous work supports strong agreement between short and full 65-itemscores [ 36,37] and the stability of SRS scores over these ages, particu- larly for the school-aged form [ 33,38]. Statistical analyses Weﬁrst examined prenatal ﬁsh intake and ω-3 supplement use by demographic characteristics of study participants.Next, we used lo-gistic regression to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) forautism associated with categories of ﬁsh intake and ω-3 supplement use (yes/no), separately.We parameterized ﬁsh intake as binary (any/none) and in the above-described 4 categories.We also examined supplementuse as a binary variable, following the same modeling strategy used forﬁsh intake.
Adjusted analyses included maternal age, prepregnancy BMI, race and ethnicity, education, smoking status, and child ’s sex assigned at birth, and year of birth as covariates. Adjustment for cohort was included as a random effect.Adjustment for additional covariates was tested in sensitivity analyses as described further.We imputed dataon missing covariates using multiple imputation with chainedequations.Analyses of SRS scores followed the exposure parameterization and covariate adjustment strategy outlined for autism diagnosis butused linear regression for our primary analyses.As a secondaryapproach, we used quantile regression to examine effect sizes acrossquantiles of SRS.Quantile regression is a ﬂexible modeling approach that handles nonnormally distributed outcomes while allowing forexamination of effects across different quantiles of the outcome mea-sure [ 39,40].
In addition, we ran secondary models using SRS T-scores (rather than raw scores used in primary models) to facilitate clinically relevant interpretations. We also ﬁtted a series of secondary models and conducted sensi- tivity analyses to test the robustness of our results.First, in modelsaddressing associations with autism, we tested differences by cohortswith differing baseline level risk of autism (preterm birth and family-based cohorts) and examined potential differences in associations bychild’s sex (given the much higher prevalence of autism in males), in stratiﬁed models.Next, for supplement use, we examined potential differences by frequency of supplement use (none, 1 –3 times/wk, 4 –6 times/wk, or daily or more) in the subset of participants with this in- formation ( n¼1884).
To test the robustness of our primary ﬁndings, we adjusted primary models for additional covariates by individuallyadding household income to the primary adjusted model, which mayrelate to both ﬁsh and supplement intake and access to autism diag- nostic resources, with coadjustment for the other exposure (e.g., ﬁsh for supplement use and vice versa). We also tested adjustment for prenatalvitamin use, which has been linked to autism in a previous work.Adjustment for preterm birth, which could lie on the pathway betweenthese exposures and outcomes, was also explored as a simple test ofpotential mediation.Finally, we conducted analyses leaving out indi-vidual cohorts one at a time for associations with our primary outcome, autism diagnosis, to con ﬁrm if any 1 cohort (or speci ﬁc assessment methods or sample characteristics) was driving the results.All statis-tical analyses were conducted in SAS, version 9.4.
Results The basic characteristics of our study population are summarized in Table 1 . Approximately 20% of all participants reported no ﬁsh intake, and most (65% –85% depending on the analytic sample) reported no ω-3 supplement use.Child participants were born between 1999 and 2019.Owing to the inclusion of several cohorts following youngersiblings of a child with autism and a case –control study, the autismK.Lyall et al.The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 120 (2024) 583 –592 585 TABLE 1 Basic characteristics of the study population.

Lyall et al. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 120 (2024) 583 –592 586 prevalence was higher in our analytic samples (4% –9%) than that in the general population (~1.5% –2%) [ 41].The mean SRS raw score was ~33 (SD ¼22) and mean T-score 50 (SD ¼9).Participants in our study population are broadly representative of those included in a recentsummary of ﬁsh intake and supplement use in ECHO that did not exclude participants on the basis of ASD outcome information [ 42], although our sample had a somewhat higher proportion of Whiteparticipants.Participants included in this study were also broadlyrepresentative of ECHO pregnant participants on education and income[22], although our study sample had a somewhat lower proportion of Hispanic participants than ECHO overall, and race varied somewhatacross our analytic samples as presented in Table 1 .We observed an inverse association of ﬁsh intake with risk of autism diagnosis, comparing any ﬁsh intake to none.
This association was similar with adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted OR: 0.84;95% CI: 0.77, 0.92) ( Table 2 ). In analyses of categorical, rather than binary (any), ﬁsh intake, we did not observe stronger associations with higher amounts of ﬁsh intake; instead, all categories of ﬁsh intake were associated with reductions in odds of ~20% compared with no ﬁsh intake ( Table 2 ).The results were similar when strati ﬁed by cohort type (Supplemental Table 2 ), although point estimates were further below the null —and with wider CIs —in the cohorts enriched for autism risk.Results strati ﬁed by child sex suggested somewhat stronger (more in- verse) associations in females and more attenuated associations inmales (adjusted OR for any ﬁsh intake: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.86 for females, and adjusted OR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.12 for males); how-ever, CIs across strata overlapped and overall patterns were consistent with primary analyses.
We did not observe an association between ω-3 supplement use and autism diagnosis (adjusted OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.57) ( Table 2 ). Noevidence was found for modi ﬁcation by cohort type, and although the results strati ﬁed by child sex suggested increased odds of autism in girls, but not in boys, with supplement use, estimates were not statis-tically signi ﬁcant and CIs overlapped across these strata ( Supplemental Tables 2 and 3 ).In secondary analyses that examined the frequency of ω-3 supplement use ( Supplemental Table 4 ), the estimate for daily supplement use was similar to the primary analysis relying on any use.Of note, most participants reporting any supplement use were regularusers (nearly 90% reported 4 times/wk or more).In analyses with our quantitative trait measure of autism-related phenotype, we observed modest reductions of ~2 points in raw SRSscores with any ﬁsh intake ( βfor any ﬁsh intake: /C01.69; 95% CI: /C03.3, /C00.08) ( Table 3 ).
Higher ﬁsh intake was not associated with reductions in SRS scores. Moreover, ω-3 supplement use was associated with a modest increase in SRS scores ( β: 1.98; 95% CI: 0.33, 3.64) ( Table 3 ), counter to our hypothesis.Overall, no strong differences were detected in these results across quantiles of the SRS ( Supplemental Figure 2 )i nt h e quantile regression analyses.Results using SRS T-scores were similar toprimary analyses of raw scores, albeit of smaller magnitude given theconstrained distribution of the T score ( Supplemental Table 5 ).Furthermore, in post hoc analyses testing SRS results strati ﬁed by sex and cohort type (parallel to those run for autism diagnosis), we did notsee evidence of differences in associations across these strata.In the sensitivity analyses, adjustment for other factors, including income, exposure coadjustment, prenatal vitamin use, or preterm birth,did not materially alter the ﬁndings ( Supplemental Table 6 ).
In the analyses that left out individual cohorts, we did not observe evidence that any 1 cohort drove the results of the autism diagnosis analyses (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4 ). Thus, the general pattern of results across cohorts remained consistent with the primary analyses.TABLE 2 Association of maternal ﬁsh intake and ω-3 supplement use during pregnancy with child autism diagnosis.n1Crude OR (95% CI) Adjusted OR (95% CI)2 Fish intake No 664 1.0 (referent) 1.0 (referent)Yes 3275 0.83 (0.77, 0.90) 0.84 (0.77, 0.92) Fish intake categories Never 664 1.0 (referent) 1.0 (referent) <1/C2/wk 1373 0.82 (0.73, 0.91) 0.81 (0.71, 0.92) 1–2/C2/wk 1167 0.86 (0.73, 1.02) 0.89 (0.75, 1.06) >2/C2/wk 735 0.82 (0.72, 0.92) 0.84 (0.73, 0.97) ω-3/Fish oil supplement use No 3894 1.0 (referent) 1.0 (referent) Yes 643 1.09 (0.81, 1.48) 1.14 (0.83, 1.57) Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs from logistic regression models.

Multiple imputation was used in analyses of associations between exposures and outcomes.K. Lyall et al.The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 120 (2024) 583 –592 587 Discussion In this large study of the association between autism-related out- comes and prenatal ﬁsh intake and ω-3 supplement use in the United States ECHO program, we observed a reduction in the likelihood of an autism diagnosis and autism-related traits associated with maternal ﬁsh intake during pregnancy.In contrast, supplement use was not associ-ated with an autism diagnosis and was associated with a modest in-crease in autism-related traits.Given that ﬁsh intake serves as a key source of nutrients critical for fetal neurodevelopment and maternalhealth and is consumed at lower than recommended levels in the UnitedStates population [ 12,23,42], these ﬁndings suggest the need for improved supports in translating guidelines for pregnant people in theUnited States into practice.
Few studies have examined prenatal ﬁsh intake in association with an autism diagnosis. The Nurses ’H e a l t hS t u d yI I( 3 1 7A S D cases of >17,000 participants) did not ﬁnd an association with re- ported autism and ﬁsh intake before and during pregnancy, although an inverse association with total die tary maternal polyunsaturated fat intake was observed [ 43].Similarly, results from the United States Markers of Autism Risk in Babies- Learning Early Signs study re- ported an inverse association with ω-3 fatty acid concentrations based on reported dietary intake but did not examine ﬁsh intake speci ﬁcally [ 44].In a small case –control study (108 cases) conducted in China, an inverse association of maternal carp intake with autism was reported, but intake focused on the periconceptional period [ 45].
In the United Kingdom-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents a n dC h i l d r e nc o h o r t ,n oa ssociation between white ﬁsh, oily ﬁsh, or shellﬁsh and autism was found, although the sample included about half the number of cases as in our analysis, and some suggestiveﬁndings for autism-rela ted traits were reported [ 46]. Our results extend these previous ﬁndings in a larger sample (including ~350 children with an autism diag nosis) and by assessing total ﬁsh intake during pregnancy.Previous work has not examined potential dif-ferences in these associations by sex.
Our results of secondary ana-lyses strati ﬁed by sex suggesting somewhat stronger associations with ASD in females may align with some evidence for stronger links between prenatal PUFA intake and ASD with co-occurring intel- lectual disability [ 47], and documentation of higher diagnosis of ASD with co-occurring intelle ctual disability in females [ 48] as well; however, these differences by sex and co-occurring diagnoses requirefurther study.Compared with studies that have assessed autism diagnosis, a larger number of studies have examined associations between prenatal ﬁsh intake and broader traits related to autism. No association betweenmaternal ﬁsh intake and SRS scores (according to a subset of 18 items) was found in the Generation R cohort [ 49].
In a previous work that included 426 children drawn from 2 United States prospective preg- nancy cohorts (one of which also participates in ECHO), no signi ﬁcant associations were found between overall ﬁsh intake during pregnancy and child SRS scores [ 50]. However, a greater intake of shell ﬁsh and large ﬁsh was associated with higher SRS scores, whereas a greater intake of salmon was associated with lower autism-related traits.Inaddition, stronger associations were observed for ﬁsh intake in the second half of pregnancy (a period that represents a high uptake ofPUFAs in the developing brain).Additionally, a study within theSpanish Childhood and Environment Project (Infancia y MedioAmbiente) [ 51], including ~2000 mother –child pairs, also reported modest reductions in autism-related traits, as measured by the Child- hood Asperger Syndrome Test, with prenatal ﬁsh intake.The results accounted for child seafood intake, or methylmercury concentrations,and were attenuated but persisted.
Our analyses of SRS scores areconsistent with these previous studies, suggesting modest inverse as-sociations between ﬁsh intake and autism-related traits. Our study also suggests that these associations are consistent with the direction ofassociation with an autism diagnosis and thus contributes importantﬁndings on United States ﬁsh intake to the existing literature.Few studies have addressed prenatal ω-3 supplement use and autism-related outcomes.In both the United States –based Nurses ’ Health Study II and a study in Norway, no associations were reported between prenatal ω-3ﬁsh oil supplement use and offspring autism, although use was very low in the former study population [ 43,52].A recent meta-analysis of observational studies of neurocognitivedevelopmental outcomes suggested no bene ﬁt of prenatal DHA sup- plement use on these outcomes overall and insuf ﬁcient evidence for autism [ 12].
These previous results, along with our main null ﬁndings for supplement use, are also consistent with a majority of randomizedtrials that examined associations of prenatal maternal supplementationwith offspring cognitive outcomes [ 53–55]. However, we also observed a minor increase in SRS scores with supplement use.Po-tential explanations for discrepancies across the results for ﬁsh intake and supplement use could relate to the bioavailability of fatty acids, differences in mitigating effects of coexposures that may increase riskssuch as additives or contaminants in supplements compared with thoseTABLE 3 Associations of maternal ﬁsh intake and ω-3 supplement use during pregnancy with child Social Responsiveness Scale scores (raw score).

The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 120 (2024) 583 –592 588 inﬁsh, unmeasured confounding, or, perhaps, the role of other bene- ﬁcial nutrients in ﬁsh, such as selenium, iodine, iron, or vitamin D, acting alone or in combination with PUFAs. In our analyses, we did not observe evidence of a trend or stronger inverse associations with greater ﬁsh intake across our analysis.This ﬁnding of an overall bene ﬁt with any intake could be due to the rela- tively low overall ﬁsh intake in our study population relative to United States dietary guidelines for pregnancy [ 56,57], with reduced power in higher intake categories, as trends have been noted in other studies ofautism-related and cognitive outcomes in populations with higher ﬁsh intake [ 51,58].Alternatively, it is also possible that a “threshold ”effect may exist, whereby minimum concentrations of PUFAs are neededduring development.
Only 4 studies to date have examined associationsbetween autism and prenatal or neonatal concentrations of PUFAs, withinconsistent ﬁndings [ 45,47,49,59]. The mixed evidence with measured PUFA concentrations could relate to differences in studypopulations across United States and European studies or differences in the timing of PUFA measurements.Fish intake, and in particular PUFAs, may impact neurodevelopmental outcomes through multiplemechanisms, including direct effects on neurogenesis and differentia-tion [ 60] and in ﬂuences on in ﬂammatory processes.Future work should seek to further resolve biomarker associations and mechanisticpathways.Our study has many strengths, including its large sample size, the assessment of both autism diagnosis and an autism-related quantitativetrait measure, and the ability to adjust for key confounders and toexplore potential differences across differing cohort types.However,several limitations should be noted.
First, we were not able to examine associations by type of ﬁsh or to assess the role of potential co- occurring pollutants or toxicants in ﬁsh. Different ﬁsh not only contain differing concentrations of bene ﬁcial PUFAs but also carry differing levels of contamination [ 61,62].Although existing evidence does not support independent associations of methylmercury withautism [ 13,51,58] and support for other chemical exposures, such as perﬂuoroalkyl substances and polychlorinated biphenyls, is inconsis- tent for associations with autism [ 63–66], future work should further assess adjustment for cocontaminants to better understand overallbeneﬁts ofﬁsh [67].Second, owing to limited data on timing across all cohorts, we did not conduct analyses by trimester of pregnancy or intake during lactation/early postnatal life.Third, our analyses of supplement use did not address dose, which should be explored infuture work.
Fourth, we relied on self-reported data, and we cannot ruleout the potential for measurement error in exposure data. Althoughexisting biomarker-based studies of PUFAs have some commonalitiesinﬁ ndings with studies based on ﬁsh intake, the ideal future study design would be to incorporate both.Fifth, although we adjusted for arange of covariates, we cannot rule out potential residual confounding,such as by other health-related behaviors such as physical activity oravoidance of other chemical/toxicant exposures that could be associ-ated with both diet and neurodevelopment.Sixth, as noted earlier, ﬁsh intake in the United States is lower than that in many other countries, and our results may not generalize to other countries with differingintake patterns.
We also cannot rule out the potential for selection biasby factors related to availability of exposure and outcome informationrequired for inclusion in analyses in this study, although as noted,participants were broadly representative of ECHO pregnant individualsand results were fairly robust to sensitivity analyses. Finally, our autismdiagnoses were based on parent report of a clinician diagnosis, ratherthan direct assessment in all participants; however, several cohorts didconduct gold-standard diagnostic assessments, and the results did not differ in our leave-1-out analyses that assessed the impact of individualcohorts on ﬁndings.Despite these limitations, our ﬁndings were robust to several sensitivity analyses and broadly consistent across outcomemeasures.In summary, our study contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting a role of prenatal diet in offspring autism-related outcomes.
In particular, the results from this national study suggest that maternalﬁsh intake, but not ω-3 supplement use, during pregnancy is associated with reductions in the likelihood of autism and autism-related traits.Ourﬁndings are consistent with current dietary guidelines that support ﬁsh intake during pregnancy and support continued public health ef- forts to encourage ﬁsh intake, accounting for types of ﬁsh with the lowest risk of toxicants.
