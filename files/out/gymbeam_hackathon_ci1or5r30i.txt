SCIENTIFIC OPINION ADOPTED: 29 March 2023 doi: 10.2903/j.efsa.2023.8006 Scienti ﬁc opinion on the tolerable upper intake level for vitamin B6 EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA), Dominique Turck, Torsten Bohn, Jacqueline Castenmiller, Stefaan de Henauw, Karen-Ildico Hirsch-Ernst, Helle Katrine Knutsen, Alexandre Maciuk, Inge Mangelsdorf, Harry J McArdle, Carmen Pelaez, Kristina Pentieva, Alfonso Siani, Frank Thies, Sophia Tsabouri, Marco Vinceti, Susan Fairweather-Tait, Misha Vrolijk, Lucia Fabiani, Ariane Titz and Androniki Naska Abstract Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) was asked to deliver a scienti ﬁc opinion on the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for vitamin B6.Systematic reviews of the literature were conducted by a contractor.
The relationshipbetween excess vitamin B6 intakes and the development of peripheral neuropathy is well establishedand is the critical effect on which the UL is based. A lowest-observed-effect-level (LOAEL) could not beestablished based on human data.A reference point (RP) of 50 mg/day is identi ﬁed by the Panel from a case –control study, supported by data from case reports and vigilance data.An uncertainty factor (UF) of 4 is applied to the RP to account for the inverse relationship between dose and time to onset of symptoms and the limited data available.The latter covers uncertainties as to the level of intake that would represent a LOAEL.This leads to a UL of 12.5 mg/day.From a subchronic study in Beagledogs, a LOAEL of 50 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day can be identi ﬁed.Using an UF of 300, and a default bw of 70 kg, a UL of 11.7 mg/day can be calculated.
From the midpoint of the range of thesetwo ULs and rounding down, a UL of 12 mg/day is established by the Panel for vitamin B6 for adults(including pregnant and lactating women). ULs for infants and children are derived from the ULfor adults using allometric scaling: 2.2 –2.5 mg/day (4 –11 months), 3.2 –4.5 mg/day (1 –6 years), 6.1–10.7 mg/day (7 –17 years).Based on available intake data, EU populations are unlikely to exceed ULs, except for regular users of food supplements containing high doses of vitamin B6.©2023 European Food Safety Authority.EFSA Journal published by Wiley-VCH GmbH on behalf of European Food Safety Authority.

The above-mentioned provisions lay down the criteria to be taken into account when establishing these maximum amounts that include the upper safe levels (ULs) of vitamins and minerals establishedby scienti ﬁc risk assessment based on “generally accepted scienti ﬁc data, taking into account, as appropriate, the varying degrees of sensitivity of different groups of consumers ”. To set maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals in forti ﬁed foods and food supplements, the Commission would like to ask the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to review the previous opinions of the Scienti ﬁc Committee on Food (SCF) or the NDA Panel on the ULs for vitamin A, 1folic acid/folate,1vitamin D,1vitamin E,1vitamin B6,1iron,1manganese1and b-carotene1to take into account recent scienti ﬁc developments and evidence.In this context, EFSA should ﬁrst review the guidelines of the SCF1for the development of Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for vitamins and minerals (adopted on 19 October 2000).
Tolerable Upper Intake Levels should be presented separately for the age group from 4/6 months onwards until 3 years of age and the general population group from 3 years onwards, taking intoaccount, as appropriate, the varying degrees of sensitivity of different consumer groups. As foods intended for the general population are also consumed by young children, young children should be considered as a potentially sensitive consumer group.1.2.Terms of Reference as provided by the European Commission In accordance with Article 29(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, the European Commission requests the European Food Safety Authority to: 1) Update the guidelines of the SCF for the development of Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for vitamins and minerals in the light of available recent scienti ﬁc and methodological developments.
2) Review existing scienti ﬁc evidence and provide advice on Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for the following vitamins and minerals including their currently authorised forms for theaddition to forti ﬁed foods and food supplements for the general population and, as appropriate, for vulnerable subgroups of the population: vitamin A folic acid/folate vitamin D vitamin E iron manganese b-carotene vitamin B6 For nutrients for which there are no, or insuf ﬁcient, data on which to base the establishment of an UL, an indication should be given on the highest level of intake where there is reasonable con ﬁdence in data on the absence of adverse effects. 1SCF , 2000.Scienti ﬁc Committee on Food.Guidelines of the Scienti ﬁc Committee on Food for the Development of Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for Vitamins and Minerals.in: Scienti ﬁc Committee on Food, Scienti ﬁc Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (2006).Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for Vitamins and Minerals.

The Panel interprets that the UL for vitamin B6 should be revised according to the principles laid down in the above-mentioned guidance, following a protocol developed for that purpose (Annex A)and covers all sources of vitamin B6 authorised for addition to foods and food supplements in the EU. 1.4.Context of the assessment The SCF in (2000) set a UL of 25 mg/day for vitamin B6 in adults, including pregnant and lactating women, based on evidence of neurotoxicity from animal and human studies.Most of the available evidence in humans came from case-reports, indicating the occurrence of clinical neuropathy atexposure levels between 100 and 6,000 mg/day vitamin B6 and at variable latency periods(1–72 months) (Schaumburg et al., 1983; Berger and Schaumburg, 1984; Parry and Bredesen, 1985; Friedman et al., 1986; Waterston and Gilligan, 1987).The ﬁrst case series of vitamin B6-related sensory neuropathy in humans was described by Schaumburg et al.
(1983) in seven patients who hadtaken 2 –6 g vitamin B6 daily mainly women who had taken vitamin B6 for the treatment of premenstrual symptoms (PMS) for 2 –40 months. Four of these patients developed neuropathy and were unable to walk.Due to lack of suf ﬁcient data related to true incidence of neuropathy, the UL was calculated using data from the case –control study by Dalton and Dalton (1987).This study investigated women attending a clinic for the treatment of PMS and taking <50–500 mg/day (exact supplemental intakes <50 mg/day not reported) supplemental vitamin B6 for around 6 months and up to 5 years.The UL was calculated using the average daily vitamin B6 intakes, i.e.100 mg, to which anuncertainty factor (UF) of 2 was applied to account for the fact that there was an inverse relationshipbetween dose and time to development of peripheral neuropathy, and an additional UF of 2 to accountfor the limited available data.
For children and adolescents, the SCF (2000)) extrapolated the UL from adults on a body weight basis, using reference weights derived by the SCF (1993). For infants, there was insuf ﬁcient data (lack of case reports or adequate animal developmental neurotoxicity data) on neurological effects to establish an UL in these developmental stages.ULs set by the SCF (2000) aresummarised in Table 1and cover vitamin B6 intakes from all food sources, including food supplements.In 2016, the NDA Panel published a scienti ﬁc opinion on dietary reference values (DRVs) for vitamin B6 (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).As per the terms of reference for this task, a review of the UL for vitaminB6 was out of the scope of the assessment and the NDA Panel focused on providing advice on therequirement of the micronutrient.
The Panel based the derivation of the average requirement (AR) and population reference intake (PRI) on the vitamin B6 intake required to maintain the mean concentration of plasma pyridoxal 5 0-phosphate (PLP) above 30 nmol/L. Six small intervention studies in young women, supported by larger cross-sectional studies showing an age-related decline in plasmaPLP concentrations in older adults, informed the AR for all women, and this was set at 1.3 mg/day.Forpregnant (AR 1.5 mg/day) and lactating (AR 1.4 mg/day) women, the AR was increased to account forthe uptake of vitamin B6 by the fetal or maternal tissues during pregnancy and the losses of vitaminB6 in breast milk.Due to lack of reliable data to determine the dietary requirement of vitamin B6 inmen, the Panel derived the AR for men (1.5 mg/day) by applying allometric scaling to the AR for all women, considering the differences in reference body weights.
For children and adolescents, the ARs for vitamin B6 were extrapolated from the AR for adults by allometric scaling and application of agrowth factor calculated as the proportional increase in protein requirement for growth relative to themaintenance requirement. The ARs for children ranged from 0.5 mg/day, for the youngest children, to1.5 mg/day for adolescent boys.In the absence of information on the variability in the requirement, acoefﬁcient of variation of 10% was used to calculate PRIs from the ARs for all age groups in children and in adults.The PRIs for children were 0.6 mg/day (1 –3 years), 0.7 mg/day (4 –6 years), 1 mg/day (7–10 years), 1.4 mg/day (11 –14 years), 1.6 mg/day (15 –17 years); and for adults the PRIs were 1.6 mg/day ( ≥18 years), 1.8 mg/day (pregnant women) and 1.7 mg/day (lactating women).
For infants (7 –11 months old), the Panel proposed an adequate intake (AI) of 0.3 mg/day, combining data from (i) upwards extrapolation from the estimated intake of vitamin B6 of exclusively breastfed infantsup to 6 months of age and (ii) downwards extrapolation from the ARs for adults by using isometricscaling and application of a growth factor calculated as the proportional increase in proteinTolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 6 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 requirement for growth relative to the maintenance requirement. The Panel stated that it was unnecessary to determine sex-speci ﬁc DRVs for infants and children up to 14 years of age.1.5.Previous assessments by other bodies The large heterogeneity in the ULs for vitamin B6 derived by different scienti ﬁc bodies is mainly the result of having used different studies as the basis for deriving the UL (Table 1).
While the SCF (2000) had based the UL on the case –control study by Dalton and Dalton (1987), the US Institute of Medicine (IOM, 1998), followed by the WHO/FAO (2004), decided not to use thisstudy because they considered it as not being suf ﬁciently reliable in terms of administered vitamin B6 doses. They based the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of 100 mg/day for adults on the publications by Bernstein and Lobitz (1988) and Del Tredici et al.(1985), which described studies on patients with diabetic neuropathy or carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in whom neuropathy did not getworse following vitamin B6 intakes of 100 –300 mg/day.No UF was applied.The SCF (2000) had noted some discrepancies in reporting in relation to the study described by Bernstein and Lobitz (1988) interms of number of patients involved and study duration.It also questioned the relevance ofthe patient population used and the appropriateness of the study duration.
This is also addressed inAnnex B in the report on the outcome of the public consultation. Based on the studies described by Bernstein and Lobitz (1988) and Del Tredici et al.(1985), the Australian and New Zealand National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC, 2006) identi ﬁed a NOAEL of 200 mg/day.Given that vitamin B6 exposure in these studies was 5 –6 months or less and as it was assumed that symptoms may take longer to appear, an UF of 4 was used and a UL of 50 mg/day was derived.The UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM, 2003) derived the UL based on a study in Beagle dogs (Phillips et al., 1978) from which a lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) of50 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day was identi ﬁed, to which a UF of 300 was applied.2.
Data and methodologies For this scienti ﬁc assessment, a protocol (Annex A) has been developed in line with EFSA ’s existing methodology (EFSA, 2020).Table 1: Overview of existing Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for vitamin B6, in mg/day Population group SCF (2000) IOM (1998) EVM (2003) WHO/FAO (2004) NHMRC (2006) Infants 0–6 months nd nd nd nd nd 7–12 months nd nd nd nd nd Children and adolescents 1–3 years 5(b)30(a)nd nd 15(a) 4–6 years 7(b)nd nd 4–8 years 40(a)nd nd 20(a) 7–10 years 10(b)nd nd 9–13 years 60(a)nd nd 30(a) 11–14 years 15(b)nd nd 14–18 years 80(a),(c)nd nd 40(a),(c) 15–17 years 20(b)nd nd Adults ≥18 years 25(c)10(d)100 ≥19 years 100(c)50(c) nd: not de ﬁned; EVM: UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals; IOM: Institute of Medicine; NHMRC: National Health and Medical Research Council; Australia and New Zealand; SCF: Scienti ﬁc Committee on Food; WHO/FAO: World Health Organization/ Food and Agriculture Organization.

(Intake assessment) What is the risk of adverse effects related to the intake of vitamin B6 in EU populations, including attendant uncertainties? (Risk characterisation) The hazard identi ﬁcation and hazard characterisation relate to the identi ﬁcation of adverse health effects of a given nutrient and the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the adverse health effectsassociated with the nutrient, including dose –response assessment and derivation of a UL, if possible.Adverse (health) effects are de ﬁned as ‘a change in the morphology, physiology, growth, development, reproduction or life span of an organism, system or (sub)population that results in animpairment of functional capacity to compensate for additional stress or an increase in susceptibility to other in ﬂuences (FAO/WHO, 2009; EFSA Scienti ﬁc Committee, 2017a).
The observable effects of high nutrient intake within the causal pathway of an adverse health effect can range from biochemicalchanges without functional signi ﬁcance (e.g. certain changes in enzyme activity) to irreversible clinical outcomes.Notably, some changes that occur before clinical manifestations could be used as surrogate orpredictive markers of subsequent adverse health effects, i.e.biomarkers of effect ’(EFSA NDA Panel, 2022).Priority adverse health effects were identi ﬁed in consultation with a panel of quali ﬁed experts on vitamin B6 and after discussion by the Working Group on ULs and the NDA Panel, taking into account previous assessments from other scienti ﬁc bodies (IOM, 1998; SCF , 2000; EVM, 2003).Priority adverse health effects are those which are expected to play a critical role for establishing a UL.
As a result of the problem formulation, the overarching risk assessment questions were further speci ﬁed into assessment subquestions (sQs) and the methods to address each sQ were selected (Table 2).

These steps were conducted by a contractor and were undertaken by the University ofCopenhagen in collaboration with the University of Oslo and the Karolinska Institutet and are described in the ﬁnal report of this outsourcing project (Tetens et al., 2023). 2.2.1.1.Priority adverse health effects (sQ3a, sQ3b and sQ4) To address sQ3a, sQ3b and sQ4, relevant human studies (and animal studies for sQ4 only) on the selected adverse health effects were identi ﬁed by the University of Copenhagen as contractor through systematic searches of the literature in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and Cochrane Central Register ofControlled Trials articles published in English.No date limit was applied.The search strategy was createdby information specialists of the University of Oslo and peer reviewed by information specialists at the Karolinska Institutet and EFSA.It is further detailed in the ﬁnal report of the outsourcing project (Tetens et al., 2023).Grey literature (i.e.
literature not indexed in literature databases) was not searched. Retrieved articles were screened in duplicate in Distiller SR ®at title and abstract level, also with the use of the arti ﬁcial intelligence tool of Distiller SR®, and at full text level for inclusion/exclusion according to the criteria de ﬁned in the protocol (Annex A).Con ﬂicts were solved by a third reviewer, if necessary.Relevant systematic reviews, if available, were hand-searched for additional pertinentstudies.Reviews, expert opinions, editorials, letters to the editors, abstracts, posters and theses notreporting on original data were excluded.Eligible designs : All experimental and observational study designs in humans (including case reports) were considered relevant.Eligible study populations : Studies were eligible if they involved individuals of any age, either healthy individuals or diseased individuals if the disease was considered not to be related to theexposure-outcome relationship.
Studies in individuals with impaired vitamin B6 status were not eligiblefor sQ3a and sQ3b. For sQ4 (developmental toxicity), studies on the development of neural tubedefects and oral clefts were excluded from further assessment, as insuf ﬁcient rather than excessive vitamin B6 intakes are proposed to be related to these outcomes through involvement of vitamin B6 as a cofactor of enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism (Li et al., 2016), and no study had been retrieved in the search that had linked high vitamin B6 intakes to the development of neural tubedefects and oral clefts.Eligible exposure measurements : Studies were eligible if they measured vitamin B6 intake (either self-reported or recorded) or used biomarkers of exposure, i.e.plasma concentrations of pyridoxine(PN), pyridoxal (PL) and PLP and urinary excretion of 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA) (Section 3.3).In relation to sQ3a and sQ3b, 3,793 unique references were identi ﬁed after removing duplicates (see ﬂow chart, Appendix A).

An additional reference was excluded during the assessmentstep owing to implausible biomarker concentrations (see Section 3.5.2.1 ). A total of 22 publications reporting on 2 HCTs and 20 observational studies were included.Data were extracted into Distiller SR ®by two extractors of the University of Copenhagen.They were jointly discussed, compared and harmonised at several time points by the two extractors.Evidence tables were prepared in Microsoft Word®and are provided in Appendix D.2.2.1.2.Other background information (sQ1, sQ2, sQ3c, sQ3d and sQ5) The evidence used to inform sQ1, sQ2, sQ3c, sQ3d and sQ5 was retrieved through non-systematic searches and was synthesised as narrative reviews.2.2.2.
Methodologies The methodology for this assessment follows the methodology laid down by the SCF (2000) for deriving ULs for nutrients, the principles established by the EFSA NDA Panel (2022), EFSA ’s guidance on the application of the systematic review methodology in food and feed safety assessments(EFSA, 2010), its principles and processes for dealing with data and evidence in scienti ﬁc assessments (EFSA, 2015), the guidance on statistical signi ﬁcance and biological relevance (EFSA Scienti ﬁc Committee, 2011), the guidance on the assessment of the biological relevance of data in scienti ﬁc assessments (EFSA Scienti ﬁc Committee, 2017a), the guidance on the use of the weight of evidence approach in scienti ﬁc assessments (EFSA Scienti ﬁc Committee, 2017b) and the draft guidance on appraising and integrating evidence from epidemiological studies for use in EFSA ’s scienti ﬁc assessments (EFSA Scienti ﬁc Committee, 2020). 2.2.2.1.
Evidence appraisal (sQ3a and sQ3b) A risk of bias (RoB) appraisal, i.e. evaluation of the internal validity of studies, was applied to eligible studies that addressed sQ3a and sQ3b.The appraisal was performed using the Of ﬁce of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) RoB tool developed by the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) (OHAT-NTP , 2015).The RoB criteria andrating instructions provided therein were tailored to the speci ﬁc research questions, for the questions addressing: (1) consideration of potential confounders, (2) con ﬁdence in the exposure characterisation and (3) con ﬁdence in the outcome assessment (Appendix B).The appraisal was performed in duplicate by independent experts of the University of Copenhagen.Discrepancies in the assessment in relation to the RoB judgement of each domain were discussedamong the assessors.In case of disagreement, a third reviewer was involved.
The OHAT RoB tool proposes ﬁve response options for each RoB question: de ﬁnitely low RoB (++), probably low RoB (+), not reported (NR), probably high RoB ( /C0), de ﬁnitely high RoB ( /C0/C0). Studies were categorised according to their overall RoB based on a three-tier system (i.e.at low (tier 1), moderate (tier 2) or high (tier 3) RoB), according to the strategy proposed by OHAT (OHAT-NTP , 2019) (Appendix B).2.2.2.2.Evidence synthesis (sQ3a, sQ3b and sQ4) Owing to the heterogeneity of studies retrieved, the evidence was synthesised narratively, and no data analyses were conducted.2.2.2.3.Evidence integration and uncertainty analysis (sQ3a, sQ3b and sQ4) Hazard identi ﬁcation Regarding sQ3a and sQ3b, a causal relationship between ‘high ’vitamin B6 intake and peripheral neuropathy is well-established.The assessment focused on the characterisation of the dose –response and no uncertainty analysis was carried out for these sQs.
Regarding sQ4, the hazard identi ﬁcation step consisted of assessing the evidence for a causal positive relationship between vitamin B6 intake and developmental toxicity. As the available body ofevidence (BoE) did not suggest a positive relationship (i.e.the relationship appears to be negative ornull), the evidence could not be used to inform the setting of the UL for vitamin B6.Therefore, noformal evidence integration and uncertainty analysis was carried out for this sQ.Tolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 10 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 Hazard characterisation At this step, evidence is integrated to select the critical effect(s) and identify a reference point (RP) for establishing the UL.
As proposed in the draft guidance for establishing and applying ULs forvitamins and essential minerals (EFSA NDA Panel, 2022), when available data are not suitable for dose –response modelling, a NOAEL or a LOAEL can be identi ﬁed and used as the RP and this was applied in view of the available evidence. To derive the UL, a UF is applied to the RP to account for theuncertainties associated with extrapolating from the observed data to the general population.ULsshould be protective for all members of the general population within a speci ﬁc age and gender category, including sensitive individuals, throughout their lifetime.The rationale for the selection of theRP and UF are documented in the scienti ﬁc opinion.2.3.Dietary intake assessment (sQ6) The assessment follows the approach outlined in the protocol for the intake assessments performed in the context of the revision of ULs for selected nutrients (EFSA, 2022).It is brie ﬂy summarised below.2.3.1.
Data Vitamin B6 intakes for all population groups from foods, excluding food supplements, had previously been estimated in the context of the scienti ﬁc opinion on DRVs for vitamin B6 (Roe et al., 2013; EFSA NDA Panel, 2016). Food intake data from the EFSA Comprehensive European FoodConsumption Database (hereinafter referred as Comprehensive Database) 2and data on vitamin B6 content in foods from the EFSA food composition database (FCDB)3were used.Given that the EFSA FCDB has not been updated since then and the number of national surveys that were newly integratedin the Comprehensive Database is limited, the intake estimates published in 2016 are still consideredadequate for the purpose of the present assessment and were not updated, except for the addition ofdata for infants aged <1 year (Section 2.3.2 ).
Regarding the use of vitamin B6 containing supplements, data in the Comprehensive Database suffer from important limitations, in particular due to partial reporting in the database of the nutrient(s)contained in food supplements. In view of the uncertainties associated with these data, the Panel reliedon information available at national level.To complement EFSA ’s intake assessment from 2016, vitamin B6 intake estimates from natural sources, from addition to foods and from food supplements based on nationally representative foodconsumption surveys and total diet studies (TDSs) published after 2016 were collected.Data onvitamin B6 intakes from forti ﬁed foods and/or food supplements published before 2016 were also considered as the contribution of those sources was not addressed in EFSA ’s previous assessment.
Data were collected between September and November 2021 by contacting 64 competent authoritiesin 37 European countries through EFSA Focal Points 4and the EFSA Food Consumption Network.5An additional search in sources of bibliographic information (Google Scholar, PubMed) was performed tocollect reports of national surveys included in the Comprehensive Database that had not been obtainedthrough the competent authorities. Between August and October 2022, EFSA contacted all EU MemberStates and Norway through the European Commission Working Group on Food supplements andFortiﬁed foods 6and collected data on the intake of vitamin B6 speci ﬁcally from food supplements.The Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD)7was used as a data source to identify the type of vitamin B6 containing food supplements and forti ﬁed foods available on the EU market.The search was limited to the past 5 years, from September 2017 to September 2022.

Methodologies EFSA ’s intake estimates were calculated by matching the food intake data from the Comprehensive Database and the data on vitamin B6 content in foods from the EFSA FCDB as available in 2016 (EFSANDA Panel, 2016) (Section 3.4.2 ). Data on intake estimates for infants ( ≥4t o <12 months), which were not in the remit of the DRV opinion from 2016, have been added to the present assessment.The methodology applied to estimate intakes in this population group is the same as for the other age groups.Vitamin B6 intake data from recent national food consumption surveys, including speci ﬁc estimates of vitamin B6 intake from food supplements and/or forti ﬁed foods, were extracted.Information on food products forti ﬁed with vitamin B6 and vitamin B6-containing supplements available on the EU market, and their vitamin B6 content as reported on the label, were extractedfrom the Mintel GNPD.
These data were used qualitatively to describe the types of forti ﬁed foods and food supplements available and to gain insight into their potential contribution to total vitamin B6 intake. 2.4.Public consultation In line with EFSA ’s policy on openness and transparency, and for EFSA to receive comments from the scienti ﬁc community and stakeholders, the draft Scienti ﬁc Opinion was released for public consultation from 13 January 2023 to 10 February 2023.The outcome of the public consultation isdescribed in a technical report published as Annex D to this Scienti ﬁc Opinion.3.Assessment 3.1.Chemistry of vitamin B6 The term vitamin B6 is the generic descriptor for all 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine derivatives exhibiting biological pyridoxine activity.Even though pyridoxine is sometimes used as synonym tovitamin B6, vitamin B6 is the recommended term to be used (IUPAC –IUB CBN, 1973).
The term vitamin B6 covers three vitamers that differ by the one-carbon substitution at the fourth position ofthe pyridine ring, i.e. the alcohol PN, the aldehyde PL and the amine pyridoxamine (PM) as well astheir phosphate esters, i.e.pyridoxine 5 0-phosphate (PNP), pyridoxal 50-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 50-phosphate (PMP), and pyridoxine glucoside (PN-50-b-D-glucoside (PNG)) (Figure 1) (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).3.2.Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) Bioaccessibility of vitamin B6, i.e.the fraction that becomes available in the gastrointestinal tract for absorption, can in principle be almost complete from many animal-based foods.However, thermal processing reduces the availability by 25 –30% because of the reaction of PL and PLP with lysine to form PL- e-lysine (Reynolds, 1988).Bioaccessibility of vitamin B6 vitamers present in plant-based foods may differ depending on the vitamer.
An in vitro study investigating the bioaccessibility of vitamin B6 vitamers from cereal-based baby food found that the bioaccessibility in the intestinal phase of PN was Figure 1: Structure of vitamin B6 vitamers (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016)Tolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 12 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 67–76%, depending on the gastric pH, while for PL and PM it was 38 –53% and 36 –50%, respectively (Yaman and Mizrak, 2019). PL, PN and PM are absorbed without modi ﬁcation while the phosphorylated forms of the vitamers need to be dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase ﬁrst (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).Also, PNG, a vitamer found in fruits, vegetables, in particular crucifers and cereal-grains and constituting 5 –80% of their vitamin B6 content, requires hydrolysis before intestinal absorption, even though some intact PNGcan also be absorbed and excreted unmetabolised in urine (Reynolds, 1988).
The enzymatic hydrolysisof PNG at the intestinal epithelial brush-border occurs with the involvement of pyridoxine-5 0-b-D- glucoside hydrolase (Nakano et al., 1997) and lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (Mackey et al., 2004). The hydrolysis is the rate limiting step in the absorption of this vitamer (Nakano et al., 1997; Mackeyet al., 2004).Absorption takes place in the jejunum via diffusion (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).In vitro studies have suggested that vitamin B6 absorption may also be carrier-mediated by thiamine multi-speci ﬁc membrane transporters (Said et al., 2003; Said, 2011; EFSA NDA Panel, 2016; Yamashiro et al., 2020; Miyake et al., 2022).Evidence from in vitro studies suggests that vitamin B6 synthesised by the intestinal microbiota can be absorbed in the colon, but the amount absorbed in vivo in humans is unknown (Said, 2011; EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).
The absorption of PN from supplements in the form of PN hydrochloride (PN-HCl), the most widespread form of vitamin B6 in food supplements, is almost complete with 95% absorption (EFSANDA Panel, 2016). In a study comparing the bioavailability of PN-HCl (4 mg/day) with equimolar dosesof PM dihydrochloride monohydrate and PL-HCl in humans (Wozenski et al., 1980), similarbioavailability of the three supplemental forms was reported, based on the assessment of urinary 4-pyridoxic acid (PA) excretion and plasma total vitamin B6 and PLP concentrations.The bioavailability ofPNG has been found to be around 50% lower than that of PN-HCl (Gregory III et al., 1991; Nakanoet al., 1997).However, as PNG contributes only about 15% to total vitamin B6 intakes, the reduced bioavailability of vitamin B6 from this vitamer is of little practical relevance (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).Overall, vitamin B6 absorption from mixed diets has been estimated to be around 75%.
This estimation is based on a study using plasma PLP concentration and urinary vitamin B6 concentrationas biomarkers and PN-HCl as a reference (Tarr et al., 1981; EFSA NDA Panel, 2016), meaning that1 mg vitamin B6 from food is equivalent to 0.8 mg PN-HCl from food supplements when taking intoaccount the lower absorption of vitamin B6 from mixed diets (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016). Following uptake in the enterocytes, the dephosphorylated vitamers can become re-phosphorylated by pyridoxal kinase (i.e.metabolic trapping) or be released into the portal vein by passive diffusion.In order for the metabolically trapped vitamers to be released into the portal vein, they need to be dephosphorylated again (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).In the liver, the vitamers are re-phosphorylated in the hepatocytes by pyridoxal kinase.
PNP and PMP are subsequently oxidised with the involvement of pyridoxine and pyridoxamine 5 0-phosphate oxidases to PLP , which is the principal active vitamer (Hadtstein and Vrolijk, 2021; Liu et al., 2022). Before secretion into the circulatory system from hepatocytes, PLP is bound to lysine residues of proteins, mostly albumin, which is the main transport protein for PLP (Hadtstein and Vrolijk, 2021;Berger et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022).PLP constitutes 70 –90% of total vitamin B6 in plasma at normal intakes, with PL and 4-PA being the other major vitamers (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).At high vitamin B6 intakes, PL becomes the predominant vitamer in plasma, owing to the fact that only a limited amountof PLP can be bound to protein and unbound PLP will be dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase toPL (Vrolijk et al., 2020).At high PN intakes, both pyridoxal kinase and pyridoxine 5 0-phosphate oxidase become saturated which impedes the conversion of PN to PNP and to PLP .
Therefore, PN that hasbeen shown to be cytotoxic in experiments on cultured neuronal cells and that is usually not present inplasma, starts to appear in circulation, and long-term supplementation may lead to the accumulationof this vitamer (Vrolijk et al., 2017; Vrolijk et al., 2020). Free PN may also be detected in some individuals after PLP supplementation, possibly owing to the presence of proteins with pyridoxal reductase activity in those individuals (Ramos et al., 2019; Vrolijk et al., 2020).When reaching the target tissue, PLP disassociates from protein and is dephosphorylated by speci ﬁc or non-speci ﬁc alkaline phosphatase.After entering cells, it is re-phosphorylated by pyridoxal kinase (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016; Liu et al., 2022).The uptake of vitamin B6 after dephosphorylation issuggested to occur via a saturable process, exempli ﬁed by studies in liver and pancreatic cells (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016; Srinivasan et al., 2019).
The intracellular concentrations of PLP are under tightregulation (Hadtstein and Vrolijk, 2021). Studies in humans have delineated the function of a newly discovered PLP-binding protein, which binds cellular PLP , acting as a regulator of PLP homeostasis intracellularly (Darin et al., 2016; Plecko et al., 2017; Johnstone et al., 2019).Both pyridoxal reductaseTolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 13 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 and PLP-binding protein are suggested to prevent adverse reactions of the aldehyde moiety of PL/PLP with non-speci ﬁc cellular amino acids and amines (Johnstone et al., 2019; Ramos et al., 2019).The main route for elimination of vitamin B6 is the urine, with 4-PA being the main urinary metabolite, while some forms with vitamin B6 activity can also be found in urine (EFSA NDAPanel, 2016).4-PA is produced in the liver through the oxidation of PL by non-speci ﬁc aldehyde oxidases.
It has been suggested that a non-speci ﬁc nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)- dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase is also involved (Liu et al., 2022). The Panel notes that there are large inter-individual differences in metabolism of vitamin B6 that have been described, especially in case of supplemental PN-HCl intake (Vrolijk et al., 2020).3.3.Biomarkers of intake In its scienti ﬁc opinion on DRVs for vitamin B6, the Panel had concluded that plasma PLP concentrations are a reliable marker of vitamin B6 intake and status as they correlate well with vitaminB6 intakes through habitual diets (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).These may reach up to 5 mg/day inEuropean populations based on data from the EFSA Comprehensive Database and the EFSA FCDB(Section 3.4.1 ).Plasma PLP concentrations of 30 nmol/L as a population mean are indicative of an adequate vitamin B6 status (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).Urinary 4-PA excretion was considered a marker of short-term intake (i.e.
5 –7 days) but not of vitamin B6 status (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016). One study (Sharma et al., 2020) suggested that women excreted more 4-PA/mmol creatinine than men.Concentration of total vitamin B6 in plasma, the concentration of PL and PMP in plasma or red blood cells (RBCs), the concentration of PLP in RBCs, as well as ratios of concentrations of vitamin B6vitamers in plasma, were deemed not to be suitable biomarkers of vitamin B6 intake and/or status atnormal levels of intake (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).However, it has been suggested that plasma concentrations of PN, PL and 4-PA might be useful markers of high vitamin B6 exposure (van Hunsel et al., 2018).With respect to plasma PLP concentrations at high vitamin B6 intakes, it has been observed that they do not increase linearly anymore but start to level off, as reviewed by Hadtstein andVrolijk (2021).The study by Edwards et al.
(1990) tested doses of 10, 25, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/day vitamin B6 taken as PN-HCl for 1 week (design not described) and found no substantialdifferences in the achieved plasma PLP concentrations (around 600 nmol/L (blood drawn 4 h afteringestion of the ﬁnal dose) compared with around 70 nmol/L without supplementation). Other vitamers started to increase (PL and 4-PA) or appear (PN and PNP) at a dose of 100 mg/day.Also, twounidenti ﬁed metabolites appeared in plasma at intakes of 100 and 200 mg/day, respectively, with concentrations increasing at higher doses.Other reviewed studies (Speitling et al., 1990; Bor et al., 2003; Vrolijk et al., 2020) showed plasma PLP concentrations of 300 –400 nmol/L at doses of 40, 50 and 300 mg/day taken for 12, 1 and 2 weeks, respectively.
In a kinetic study in which 200 mg PMwas administered once to ﬁve healthy male volunteers (van den Eynde et al., 2021), PLP concentrations increased up to a mean ( /C6standard error; SE) of 2,787 /C6329 nmol/L within 10 h of supplementation and then remained stable (last measurement 25 h after administration). When thedose was divided into three doses consumed in 1 day, plasma PLP concentrations continued to rise to3,282 /C6281 nmol/L, which was reached after 15 h (last intake at 12 h) and then levelled off.PN, PL, PM and PMP , peaked after around 5, 5, 3 and 3 h of the single dose, respectively.When using repeated doses, concentrations of the four vitamers declined after each peak associated with intake,but mostly not to baseline levels.In particular, PL and to a lesser extent PN seemed to accumulate,even though PN concentrations had returned to zero after 25 h (13 h after last intake).
Plasma PLP concentrations decline with age, possibly owing to changing metabolism with age (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016; Sharma et al., 2020), during pregnancy, to a greater extent than can beexplained by the expanding blood volume, and in in ﬂammatory conditions (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016). They are also in ﬂuenced by albumin concentrations, alcohol consumption and alkaline phosphatase activity (Ueland et al., 2015).A reduction in albumin and an increase in alkaline phosphatase can explain the decreased plasma PLP concentrations observed in in ﬂammatory states (Ueland et al., 2017).Alkaline phosphatase activity is also in ﬂuenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the tissue non-speci ﬁc alkaline phosphatase gene, with lower alkaline phosphatase expression being associated with higher plasma PLP concentrations (Carter et al., 2015; Uelandet al., 2015; Loohuis et al., 2018).
Reduced activities because of SNPs are also known for pyridoxineand pyridoxamine 5 0-phosphate oxidases, converting PNP or PMP to PLP (Alghamdi et al., 2021; PleckoTolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 14 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 and Mills, 2022). Similarly, variants have also been identi ﬁed for pyridoxal kinase (Ghatge et al., 2021) and PLP-binding protein (Plecko et al., 2017; Johnstone et al., 2019; Heath et al., 2021).Thecontribution of vitamin B6-producing colonic bacteria to plasma PLP concentrations is unknown.3.4.Intake assessment 3.4.1.Sources of dietary vitamin B6 Dietary vitamin B6 intake from natural sources occurs primarily in the forms of PLP and PNP (Stover and Field, 2015).The main forms of vitamin B6 in animal tissues are PLP and PMP , whereas plant-based foods mainly contain PN, PNP (IOM, 1998) and PNG (Stover and Field, 2015).
Plant-derivedfoods rich in vitamin B6 include grains (whole grain corn/maize, brown rice, sorghum, quinoa, wheatgerm, buckwheat, barley, rye), pulses, nuts, seeds, white potatoes and other starchy vegetables(plantain, cassava, yam and taro), non-citrus fruits (e.g. banana, avocado, apricot, peach, pear, berries, watermelon), vegetables (e.g.artichoke, asparagus, peas, green beans, beets, cabbage, cauli ﬂower, broccoli, eggplant, mushrooms, onions, garlic) and herbs and spices such as basil, curry and ginger (IOM, 1998; EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).Animal-derived foods rich in vitamin B6 includepoultry (chicken and turkey), beef, organ meats (particularly beef liver), egg yolks and ﬁsh (particularly fresh tuna, salmon and trout) (IOM, 1998; Stover and Field, 2015; EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).
The content of total vitamin B6 in natural sources (unprocessed) from plants in mg per 100 g of grains is 0.13 –0.77, of dried pulses is 0.06 –0.58, of nuts is 0.10 –0.54, of seeds is 0.09 –0.96, of starchy vegetables is 0.08 –0.45, of non-citrus fruits is 0.12 –0.42 and of vegetables is 0.05 –0.48 (EFSA, online). Some plant sources with relatively higher contents included: garlic (0.85), fresh herbs (0.16 –0.30), curry powder (0.86) and white ginger (0.84) (EFSA, online).The content of vitamin B6 from naturalanimal sources in mg per 100 g of egg yolks is ~0.28, of ﬁsh and seafood is 0.08 –0.88, of chicken and poultry is 0.51 –0.53, of beef is 0.21 –0.36, and of organ meat is 0.13 –0.88 with liver having the highest content of 0.76 –0.88 mg/100 g (EFSA, online).Fortiﬁed foods In the EU, authorised forms of vitamin B6 for addition to foods are PN-HCl, PNP and pyridoxine dipalmitate.
8The vitamin B6 content of infant and follow-on formulae and of processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and children is regulated.9 The main source of total vitamin B6 from forti ﬁed foods are forti ﬁed breakfast cereals (Anses, online; EFSA NDA Panel, 2016). In the Mintel GNPD10a total of 7,333 packaged food products available in 24 EU Member States and Norway were identi ﬁed as containing added vitamin B6 in the ingredients list.The majority of the products belong to the Mintel categories ‘sports and energy drinks ’(17%), ‘breakfast cereals ’(16%) ‘nutritional drinks and other beverages ’(16%) and ‘baby food ’(14%).Data on vitamin B6 content per serving (as recommended by the manufacturer) based on labelled information were available for 31% of the products (n = 2,272).
Among those, this information wasavailable for 60% of ‘breakfast cereals ’(n = 687): range 0.06 –3.2 mg vitamin B6 per serving (median = 0.36 mg vitamin B6), 41% of ‘nutritional drinks and other beverages ’(n = 490): range 0.1–17 mg vitamin B6 per serving (median = 0.7 mg vitamin B6) and 24% of ‘sports and energy drinks ’(n = 309): range 0.2 –11.6 mg vitamin B6 per serving (median = 1.4 mg vitamin B6). The highest contents per serving were found in some ‘nutritional drinks ’(14–17 mg/serving) intended to be used as meal replacements and a hot beverage intended to relieve symptoms of PMS (65 mg/serving).Food supplements In the EU, authorised forms of vitamin B6 for use in food supplements are PN-HCl, PNP and PLP .11 In the Mintel GNPD, the category ‘vitamins and dietary supplements ’, was searched.It yielded a total of 2,210 products available in 24 EU Member States and Norway.

Half of the food supplements contained between 1.01 and 2.0 mg per dose, within which lie the PRIs for adult women (1.6 mg/day) and men (1.7 mg/day).About 1.4% (n = 29) of the retrieved supplements contained a labelled dose per serving of more than20 mg.3.4.2.EFSA ’s intake assessment Vitamin B6 intakes from food sources (excluding food supplements) in European populations were calculated in the context of the scienti ﬁc opinion on DRVs for vitamin B6, based on the data from the EFSA Comprehensive Database and the EFSA FCDB (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016).Food consumptionsurveys of Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Sweden were used for the assessment.
The period of data collections covered by the surveys ranged between 2000 and 2012. Further information on the characteristics and methods used for the data collection in the respectivesurveys are provided in Annex B.Food composition data from Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands were used to calculate vitamin B6 intake in these countries.For nutrient intake estimates of Ireland and Latvia, foodcomposition data from the UK and Germany, respectively, were used, because no speci ﬁc composition data from these countries were available.The percentage of vitamin B6 values in the ﬁve composition databases that were borrowed from other composition databases varied as follows: Germany 100%, Italy 91%, the UK 68%, Finland 58% and the Netherlands 50%.The intake assessment of 2016 did not distinguish between vitamin B6 ‘naturally present ’or‘added ’ to foods by manufacturers.
However, data on the consumption of foods forti ﬁed with vitamin B6 available in the Comprehensive Database 13and on the concentration of vitamin B6 in forti ﬁed foods20.948.7 19.0 8.0 2.0 1.4 0102030405060 ≤1 1.01-2.0 2.01-5.0 5.01-10.0 10.01-20.0 >20Frequency (%) Vitamin B6 content (mg/serving) Source: Mintel GNPD.

13Indicatively, 2.2% of the overall eating occasions reported a forti ﬁcation descriptor (e.g. ‘F09.Forti ﬁcation agent ’) in the latest version of the Comprehensive Database(updated in July 2021, of which 0.01% report a vitamin B6-related forti ﬁcation descriptor , for foods such as sport drinks, biscuits and multivitamin juices.These ﬁgures are likely to underestimate the actual consumption of forti ﬁed foods, as some surveys did not address the consumption forti ﬁed foods or because the survey participants did not know if the food consumed was forti ﬁed.Tolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 16 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 available in the EFSA FCDB database are scarce.Survey participants are frequently not aware that they are consuming a forti ﬁed food, hence some of the eating occasions in the Comprehensive Database likely correspond to forti ﬁed foods.
Similarly, 10-fold differences among the vitamin B6 levels were found in the EFSA FCDB for similar foods, likely due to forti ﬁcation (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016). Thus, EFSA ’s intake estimates re ﬂect vitamin B6 intake from natural sources and forti ﬁed products although it is not possible to calculate their contribution separately.The distributions of intake estimated by EFSA are presented below by age group, sex and country of origin (Figures 3and4).A summary overview, providing the ranges of means and 95th percentiles (P95) across EU surveys is given in Table 3.Lines represent the range between the 5th and 95th percentiles.Estimated intakes from 5th and 95th percentiles are not presented when sample size is below 60 participants..DE, Germany; FI, Finland; FR, France; IT , Italy; LV , Latvia; NL, The Netherlands..Source: EFSA NDA Panel (2016), except for infants.

In addition, vegetables and vegetable products was one of the main contributors tovitamin B6 intake in the age groups of adolescents and adults. Differences in main contributors tovitamin B6 intake between genders were in most cases minor (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016) (Annex C).3.4.3.Complementary information from national reports 3.4.3.1.Intake data of vitamin B6 from foods and forti ﬁed foods There is no mandatory vitamin B6 forti ﬁcation policy in EU countries.Survey characteristics, mean and P95 intake estimates are presented in Annex C.Key information is summarised below.
Intake estimates from national consumption surveys Reports from national consumption surveys providing estimates of vitamin B6 intake from foods, considering B6 forti ﬁcation but excluding food supplements are available for 14 countries: Belgium (Enqu ^ete de Consommation Alimentaire 2014 –2015), Bulgaria (National nutrition survey of infants and children 2007), Denmark (DANSDA 2011 –2013), Estonia (Children ’s National Dietary Survey and National Dietary Survey among adults 2014), Finland (FINDIET 2017), France (INCA 3, 2014 –2015), Greece (Hellenic National Nutrition and Health Survey (HNNHS) 2013 –2015), Hungary (OT /C19AP , 2019), Ireland (National Teen ’s Food Consumption Survey (NTFS) II 2019 –2020), the Netherlands (Dutch National Food Consumption Survey (DNFCS 2012 –2016)), Norway (Sm /C23abarnskost 2007, Ungkost 3 2015 and 2016, Norkost 3 2015), Slovenia (National representative study on the dietary habits ofSlovenian adolescents 2003 –2005), Spain (Encuesta Nacional de Alimentaci /C19on en la poblaci /C19on Infantil y Adolescente (ENALIA 1) 2012 –2014) and Sweden (Riksmaten adolescents 2016 –2017, Riksmaten 2010 –2011).
The surveys in Austria (€Osterreichischer Ern €ahrungsbericht 2012 and 2017), did not take fortiﬁed foods nor food supplements into consideration. Study characteristics, intake estimates and bibliographic references are provided in Annex C.At the P95, estimated intakes of males reached 1.9 mg/day in infants (0 –12 months; 2 countries), 2.1 mg/day in toddlers (1 to <3 years; 4 countries), 2.5 mg/day in other children (3 to 10 years; 6 countries), 4.3 mg/day in adolescents (10 to 18 years; 7 countries) and 5.2 mg/day in adults(≥18 years; 6 countries).The highest P95 values for infants, toddlers and children were reported in the national survey in Spain, for adolescents highest P95 values were reported in the national surveysin Sweden, Ireland and Spain; and for adults for Austria in the 19- to 25-year age range.
Estimatedintakes for females were generally lower than for males in all studies in all age groups, except fortoddlers (1 –3 years) and young adolescents (9 –14 years) in France and Spain where they were higher; and in Hungary where the P95 intake of adult females ( ≥18 years) was higher than for adult males.

Foods forti ﬁed with vitamin B6 were among the most frequently consumed in the Netherlands among consumers of such foods, contributing up to 52% of the recall days, and the mostfrequently consumed was forti ﬁed syrup lemonade drink that accounted for 38% to the intake of vitamin B6 from forti ﬁed foods (de Jong et al., 2022b). Among children and adults of both genders, the median habitual intake of vitamin B6 of consumers of vitamin B6 forti ﬁed foods was signi ﬁcantly higher compared to non-consumers of vitamin B6-forti ﬁed foods (de Jong et al., 2022b).In a further analysis, the median contribution of vitamin B6-forti ﬁed fats (margarines and other plant-based fortiﬁed fats) to the vitamin B6 intake of the Dutch population from the DNFCS 2012 –2016, was around 15% and the P95 contribution of forti ﬁed fats reached 40% (de Jong et al., 2022a).3.4.3.2.
Intake data of vitamin B6 from food supplements Information on vitamin B6 intake from all sources, including supplements, are available for 17 dietary surveys conducted in 12 countries: Belgium (Enqu ^ete de Consommation Alimentaire 2014 – 2015), Denmark (DANSDA 2011 –2013), Estonia (Children ’s National Dietary Survey and National Dietary Survey among adults 2014), Finland (FINDIET 2017), Germany (Nationale Verzehrsstudie(NVS) II, EsKiMo II), Ireland (National Teen Food Survey (NTFS II), National Children Food Survey(NCFS II)), Lithuania (Food consumption and nutrient intake study in Lithuania), the Netherlands(DNFCS 2012 –2016), Norway (Sm /C23abarnskost 2007, Ungkost 3 2015 and 2016, Norkost 3 2015), Portugal (IAN-AF 2015 –2016), Spain (ANIBES 2013) and Sweden (Riksmaten 2010 –2011). Study characteristics, and intake estimates are presented in Annex C.
Data collected on the use of vitamin B6 supplements in whole survey populations or in users only, including percent contribution to total vitamin B6 intake, absolute intakes and percent users in EUsurveys, are brie ﬂy summarised in the following paragraphs. Intake of vitamin B6 from foods supplements in the whole population Six national dietary surveys from Belgium (n = 1), Ireland (n = 4) and the Netherlands (n = 1) provided information on the contribution of vitamin B6-containing food supplements to total vitamin B6intake in the whole study population, in different age groups.A summary of the data collected and the bibliographic references are provided in Table 4.The contribution of supplements to total vitamin B6 intake was estimated to be about 6% or less for toddlers, children and adolescents in all countries.Among adults aged 18 –64 years (men and women combined), the contribution ranged between 4% in Belgium and 7% in Ireland.

Asummary of the data collected and bibliographic references are provided in Table 5. In children of different age groups who take supplements, contribution to total vitamin B6 intake from food supplements ranged from 30% in the Irish survey (5 –12 years old) to 56% in the survey in Norway (Ungkost 3 –4 years old).In adolescent users, the contribution of supplements to total vitamin B6 intake was 43% in Norway (Ungkost 3 –13 years old) and 52% and 57% in male and female adolescents aged 11 –17 years in Denmark (DANSDA 2011 –2013).In Irish adolescents from the NTFS II, the contribution of supplements to total vitamin B6 intake was about 26%, leading to an absoluteintake in high consumers (P95) of about 14 mg/day from vitamin B6 supplements only, possibly due tothe availability in the market of supplements with daily doses up to 50 mg/day for adolescents.
Adults Nine national dietary surveys conducted in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Poland and Sweden reported on the use of vitamin B6 supplements in adults (Table 5). Vitamin B6 supplements contributed more than 50% to total vitamin B6 intake in adults and older adults in all surveys and was up to 80% (in Finnish adults from the FINDIET 2017 survey).In Ireland,the contribution of supplements to total vitamin B6 intake in adults and older adults from the NANSsurvey, was lower than in all other surveys (25 and 17%, respectively).
However, P95 intakes from foodsupplements only were about 25 and 12 mg/day, respectively in adults and older adults, possibly due tothe availability in the market of supplements with daily doses up to 100 mg/day for the adult age groups.In a survey in adults in Poland, mean intake from vitamin B6 supplements was up to 30 mg/day.Country Survey name (N subjects) ReferenceDietary method (N of days)SexContribution of supplements to total mean vitamin B6 intake % (age) ToddlersOther childrenAdolescents Adults Elderly NANS 2008 –2010 (n = 1,500) (Kehoe andWalton, 2022) Netherlands DNFCS 2012 –2016 (n = 4,313)(van Rossum et al., 2020)Questionnaire (online/paper)m+f 9 (1–79 years) Sweden Riksmaten 2003 (n = 2,495) (Barbieriet al., 2003)Dietary records m + f 4 (4 years)5 (9 years)4 (11 years)NR NR CI: con ﬁdence interval; d: day; DNFCS: Dutch National Food Consumption Survey; f: females; m: males; N: number; NANS: National Adult Nutrition Survey; NCFS: National Children ’s Food Survey; NPNS: National Pre-School Nutrition Survey; NR: not reported in the publication; NTFS: National Teen ’s Food Consumption Survey; y: year.Tolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 21 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 Table 5: Percent vitamin B6 supplement users in EU surveys and vitamin B6 intake from food supplements among users Country Survey name (N of subjects) ReferenceDietary method (N of days)Sex Age range% Vitamin B6 supplement users in total survey sample/ in supplements usersVitamin B6 intake from supplements, P95 (mg/day)Contribution of supplements to total vitamin B6 intake, mean (%) Denmark DANSDA 2011 –2013 (n = 3,936)(Hindborg, 2015, unpublished)Face-to-face interview m fm f mf4–10 years 11–17 years 11–17 years 18–50 years 18–50 years 51–75 years 51–75 years61/ NR 47/NR 43/NR 42/NR 52/NR 44/NR 58/NRNR 37 525751 59 60 67 Finland FINDIET 2017(n = 1,655) (Valsta et al., 2018)FPQ m f18–74 years 26/ NR 36/NR(mean, mg/day) 8.7 7.679 80 Germany NVS II 2005 –2007 (n = 13,753) (Heuer et al., 2012)24-h recall (2 day)m f15–80 years 7.3/NR 9.4/NR5.9 648 57 Germany EsKiMo II 2015 – 2017 (n = 2,644)(Mensink et al.,2021) (Perlitz et al, 2019)Questionnaire + weighing logsm+f 6 –11 years 12–17 years2.2/NR 4.2/25.7NR NR Ireland NPNS 2011 –2012 (n = 500) NCFS II 2017 –2018 (n = 600)NTFS II 2019 –2020 (n = 428) NANS 2008 –2010 (n = 1,500) (Kehoe and Walton, 2022)Weighted food diary (4 days)m+f 1 –4 years 5–12 years 13–18 years 18–64 years 65–90 years11/53 16/72 7/51 14/4712/332.5 1.9 13.8 25 11.822 28 26 25 17.2 Norway Sm/C23abarnskost 2015 (n = 1,674)Ungkost 3 2016 (4 years, n = 399) Ungkost 3 2015(9 years, n = 636) Ungkost 3 2015 (13 years, n = 687)Norkost 3 2015(n = 1,787) (VKM, 2017)FFQ + food diary + 24-h dietary interviewsm + f 2 years 4 years 9 years 13 years 18–70 years33/NR 42/NR 33/NR23/NR 23/NR1.2 1.4 1.2 1.7 5.340 56 4143 56 Poland National Dietary Survey 2019 –2020 (n = 1,831)(Stos et al., 2021)FPQ m f18–65+ yearsNR/40 NR/71Mean /C6SD (range) 3.4/C65.5 (0.7–25) 2.4/C64.1 (0.4–30)NATolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 22 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 Other information collected on food supplements among EU Member States Nutritional guidelines or recommendations at national level in the EU do not advise on supplementation with vitamin B6.
Among the 27 EU Member States contacted and Norway, four providedthe maximum daily dose of vitamin B6 regulated for addition to food supplements: it was 4.2 mg/day in Luxembourg, 1410 mg/day in Italy,1518 mg/day in Poland16and 21 mg/day in the Netherlands.17The maximum daily doses as recommended by the food business operators and noti ﬁed to national authorities has been shared by a few countries: Norway (4.2 mg/day (VKM, 2017), Denmark18(50 mg/ day) and Finland (400 mg/day) (unpublished data from the Finnish Food Safety Authority). 3.4.4.Overall conclusions on intake data The Panel notes that the P95 estimated intake of vitamin B6 from food consumption only (i.e.
without food supplements) is up to 1.2 mg/day in infants (4 to <12 months), up to 1.9 mg/day in toddlers (1 to <3 years), up to 2.7 mg/day in other children (3 to <10 years), up to 4 mg/day in adolescents (10 to <18 years) and up to 5 mg/day in adults ( ≥18 years), across surveys included in EFSA ’s intake assessment (EFSA NDA Panel, 2016) (Table 3). Intakes are slightly lower in females, except for female toddlers, mainly due to smaller quantities of food consumed per day.Nationalreports of more recent data do not indicate that vitamin B6 intakes of high (P95) consumers in EU Member States may exceed EFSA estimates of intake from food sources only, but comparisons are difﬁcult owing to the different methodologies and food composition tables used.The Panel notes that forti ﬁed foods were found to contribute little to total vitamin B6 intake, at population levels, in the 15 countries for which information is available.
The Panel notes the inherentuncertainties related to self-reported intakes of forti ﬁed foods in food consumption surveys, as well as uncertainties in the composition data, which can hamper the accurate evaluation of the actualcontribution of these foods. Additionally, in view of the high content of some forti ﬁed products in the EU market Section 3.4.1 the Panel notes that the contribution of forti ﬁed foods to total vitamin B6 intake could be signi ﬁcant among regular consumers of these foods but data are too limited for a reliable intake assessment of this group.Data on the contribution of food supplements to total vitamin B6 intakes in supplement users are available for a limited number of European countries.Among supplement users, the Panel notes that,in children, food supplements were found to contribute more than 20% and up to about 60% to totalvitamin B6 intake in children aged 9 years in Norway.

In Irish adolescents and adults who were users of food supplements, vitamin B6 supplements contributed to about 17 to 26% of totalvitamin B6 intake with P95 vitamin B6 intakes from supplements of about 14 mg/day in adolescents,25 mg/day in adults and 12 mg/day in older adults.In adults in all other countries, vitamin B6supplements contributed more than 50% to total vitamin B6 intake, and up to about 80% of totalvitamin B6 intake in adults in Finland.The Panel notes that data from the Mintel GNPD indicate that half of the food supplements on the market contain between 1.01 and 2.0 mg per serving dose and less than 1% of the supplements retrieved contain more than 25 mg per serving dose.
However, the Panel notes the high variability in the maximum daily doses indicated by business operators in the labels of vitamin B6 containing foodsupplements noti ﬁed to national authorities in the Member States (up to 4.2, 50 and 400 mg in Norway, Denmark and Finland, respectively). The Panel notes that in regular consumers of vitamin B6-containing supplements, the contribution of supplements to total vitamin B6 intake can be substantial.The Panel also notes the high variability in the maximum amounts set by national authorities foraddition of vitamin B6 to food supplements.3.5.Hazard identi ﬁcation 3.5.1.Peripheral neuropathy The evidence table is in Appendix D.1.3.5.1.1.Evidence from human studies relating vitamin B6 intake to neuropathy The relationship between high intakes of vitamin B6 and the development of peripheral neuropathy is well established both in humans and in animals (IOM, 1998; SCF , 2000).
Most of the studies retrieved as pertinent through the systematic search for the present assessment, had already been considered by the SCF (2000) in its previous evaluation. The pertinentstudies are described in the following, including the considerations made by the SCF (2000) duringtheir assessment, when relevant.The RoB of the overall BoE was moderate to high (Appendix B).Some studies were not further considered in the assessment because of the reasons outlined in the following paragraphs.Studies that used vitamin B6 vitamer concentrations in plasma/serum only as exposure markers and studies that provided too limited information on dietary vitamin B6 exposure were not used in theevaluation and are listed in Appendix C(Franzblau et al., 1996; Keniston et al., 1997; Scott et al., 2008; No authors listed, 2009; Chaudary and Cornblath, 2013; Falcone and Sowa, 2013; Kauret al., 2014; Visser et al., 2014; Bacharach et al., 2017; Malek et al., 2020; Stewart et al., 2022).
Most studies that investigated supplemental vitamin B6 intakes that exceeded 500 mg/day were also not used in the evaluation and are listed in Appendix C(Schaumburg et al., 1982; Baer, 1984; Berger and Schaumburg, 1984; Vasile et al., 1984; Foca, 1985; Fr iedman et al., 1986; Waterston and Gilligan, 1987; Gdynia et al., 2008; No authors listed, 2009). This is the dose for which the SCF (2000) had alreadyconcluded that it represented a potentially toxic d ose for humans associated with severe symptoms and which is also ﬁve times higher than the RP used by the SCF (2000) for setting the UL.Only the publications by Schaumburg et al.(1983) and Berger et al.(1992) are brie ﬂy described in the following because they established the occurrence of vitamin B6-associated peripheral neuropathy in humans and the existence of an inverse relationship between the dose of vitamin B6 and the time to onset of symptoms.The case series by Schaumburg et al.
(1983) was the ﬁrst to demonstrate that high vitamin B6 intakes at doses of ≥2,000 mg/day taken for 2 months to several years led to the development of peripheral neuropathy in humans, a relationship that had previously already been observed in rats anddogs (SCF , 2000). Symptoms in all individuals improved after withdrawal of vitamin B6 supplements.The intervention study by Berger et al.(1992) establi shed that an inverse relat ionship between dose and time to onset of symptoms of peripheral neuropathy existed in humans.In this study, ﬁve healthy volunteers received vitamin B6 in amounts of 12 mg/kg bw per d ay (two subjects), 19.5 mg/kg bw per day, 26.5 mg/kg bw per day or 56.9 mg/kg bw per day.In one individual who had consumed 12 mg/kg bw per day for14 months, Quantitative sensory testing (QST) abnorm alities developed withou t symptoms of neuropathy.
However, serum PLP concentrations were only abou t 80 nmol/L compared with 650 nmol/L in the other individual who had also consumed vitamin B6 in an amount of 12 mg/kg bw per day for 7 months until symptoms of neuropathy and QST abnormalities occu rred. In the other individuals, QST abnormalities alongside neuropathy symptoms showed after 4.5, 3.5 and 1.5 months of having consumed 19.5, 26.5 andTolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 24 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 56.9 mg/kg bw per day, respectively.Serum PLP conce ntrations were around 300 nmol/L and 750 nmol/L in the individuals who had consumed 19.5 and 26.5 mg/kg bw per day, respectively, and were not reported fortheﬁfth individual.The following studies were used in the evaluation of the lower bound of daily vitamin B6 intake that is associated with the development of peripheral neuropathy.
One prospective cohort study (Shrim et al., 2006), two retrospective studies (Brush et al., 1988; Chaudary et al., 2003) and one case –control study (Dalton and Dalton, 1987) investigated the relationship between supplemental vitamin B6 intake and peripheral neuropathy at doses <500 mg/ day. Case reports (Dalton, 1985; Parry and Bredesen, 1985; Dalton and Dalton, 1987; Blackburn and Warren, 2017) and data from nutrivigilance systems of EU Member States (van Hunsel et al., 2018; Noauthors listed, 2020; Vrolijk et al., 2020) also support the occurrence of symptoms at supplementaldoses <500 mg/day.Prospective cohort study In the prospective cohort study, Shrim et al.(2006) followed 96 pregnant women up to birth who had taken vitamin B6 supplements during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy in amounts of 50 –150 mg/day for an average of 9 /C64 (SD) weeks.Another 96 pregnant women not taking supplements were followed as well.
The authors report that no adverse events related to vitamin B6 use were reported by participants. ThePanel notes that it is unclear how adverse events were assessed in the study.The Panel also notes that theduration of consumption of vitamin B6 supplements may have been too short to induce symptoms ofperipheral neuropathy.This limits the conclusions that can be drawn from this study.Retrospective studies Chaudary et al.(2003) conducted a retrospective cohort study in 555 individuals, aged 14–76 years, who had attended a nutritional therapy practice and who had been recommended to consume between 30 and 250 mg/day supplemental vitamin B6 for over 3 months.
Before havingstarted supplementation, the subjects had ﬁlled in a questionnaire that asked for the presence or absence of symptoms that could be associated with the de ﬁciency of certain vitamins and minerals, among those tingling hands, insomnia, rashes and acne which could have been, as suggested by theauthors, indicative of vitamin B6 de ﬁciency. After 3 –42 months of vitamin B6 supplementation, subjects were asked to ﬁll in the questionnaire again.The authors of the study concluded that there was a reduction in frequency of symptoms, either individually or together rather than an increase.This reduction was largest in the individuals consuming 101 –150 mg/day vitamin B6.The Panel notes that symptoms had already persisted before vitamin B6 supplementation and might have been due tovitamin B6 de ﬁciency, as reported by the authors.
The Panel notes that the improvement of symptoms potentially indicative of vitamin B6 de ﬁciency cannot necessarily be interpreted as absence of adverse effects at the supplemented doses. This limits the conclusions that can be drawn from this study.In the retrospective study by Brush et al.(1988), 630 women suffering from PMS had taken initially between 40 and 100 mg/day vitamin B6 and later on mostly between 120 and 200 mg/day.Thesewomen reported no symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.The total duration of vitamin B6 exposure was <6 months in 46% of individuals and longer than 1 year in 19.5% (duration of exposure to different vitamin B6 dosages was not reported).In a follow-up of the study which was described by theSCF (2000) 19and which covered three additional years, ﬁve cases of dizziness and six cases of mild tingling were noted in 336 women taking 200 mg/day vitamin B6 (duration not reported).
The Panelconsiders that the follow-up of the study shows the occurrence of symptoms of peripheral neuropathy atsupplemental vitamin B6 doses of 200 mg/day consumed for an unknown period of time. In the case –control study described by Dalton and Dalton (1987), which was the study used by the SCF (2000) for the setting of the UL, 172 women with PMS, attending the same private practice, were recruited.The women were taking vitamin B6 supplements (range <50 mg/day to 500 mg/day) and had serum PLP concentrations >18 ng/mL ( >72.8 nmol/L).Women were asked to report symptoms indicative of peripheral neuropathy and in positive cases women were followed-up by a neurologicalexamination (not further described).A total of 103 women (60%) had neurological symptoms(paraesthesia, bone pains, hyperaesthesia, muscle weakness, fasciculation and numbness; cases),while 69 women did not have symptoms (controls).
Serum PLP concentrations were above the upperlimit of testing of 34 ng/mL (137.5 nmol/L) in 70% of cases and 55% of controls. The average vitamin 19The data on the follow-up of the study were reported in a book chapter and were thus not retrieved in the present systematic review.The description of the results, therefore, relies on the reporting by the SCF (2000b).Tolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 25 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 B6 intake was 117 /C692 mg/day (measure of spread not further speci ﬁed) in cases and 116 /C66 mg/ day in controls.Cases had, however, taken supplements on average for longer than controls (mean2.9/C61.9 vs.1.6 /C62.1 years, p <0.01) without reporting on latency periods.Doses of <50 mg/day (lower bound not reported) were consumed by 43 women (cases and controls combined) and 48% ofthese women showed symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.Exposure was >6 months in all cases.
With increasing doses, the percentage of women suffering from peripheral neuropathy increased, except inthe highest dose group which, however, also included the smallest number of participants. Thepercentage of women with symptoms were 60%, 77% and 51% of 65, 42 and 22 women in the groups consuming 50 –100 mg/day, 100 –200 mg/day and 200 –500 mg/day, respectively (data calculated by EFSA based on information provided in the publication).Following withdrawal of vitamin B6 supplements,55% of women reported partial or complete recovery after 3 months and after 6 months all hadrecovered.The Panel notes that the SCF (2000) had previously used the average supplemental intake inthis study of around 100 mg/day as a RP for the derivation of the UL.
This was based on the observationthat cases had taken vitamin B6 supplements on average for longer at the same mean intakes, indicatingthat an inverse relationship between dose and time to onset of symptoms existed at these mean intakes.The Panel, however, considers that this study not only shows an inverse relationship between dose and time to onset of symptoms, but also a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of women with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy occurring at supplemental vitamin B6 intakes of <50 mg/day (lower bound not reported) when consumed for >6 months. Case reports/series In the context of a case series, Parry and Bredesen (1985) reported that neuropathy had manifested in an individual at supplemental vitamin B6 intakes of 200 mg/day consumed for 36 months.In a case series, Dalton (1985) described 23 women who had consumed between 50 and 300 mg/ day vitamin B6 for an unknown duration.
However, it cannot be ruled out that this sample of women is also included in the study population described by Dalton and Dalton (1987). The publication by Dalton and Dalton (1987), described above, also includes the description of a case of a woman with symptoms of neuropathy who had taken 75 mg/day vitamin B6 for 2 years andwhose symptoms ceased within 3 months of having stopped supplementation.When she restartedtaking vitamin B6 at a dose of 50 mg/day, the symptoms reappeared.Blackburn and Warren (2017) described neuropathy in a male individual who had consumed six energy drinks per day, each containing 5.1 mg vitamin B6.In total, the individual had consumed 31 mg/ day vitamin B6 from energy drinks and had reduced pinprick responses and absent vibration sensation in some parts of the extremities.Latency period, overall duration of consumption, the composition of theimplicated energy drink other than vitamin B6 and other dietary habits were not reported.
Nutrivigilance data Nutrivigilance data are described in three publications (van Hunsel et al., 2018; No authors listed, 2020; Vrolijk et al., 2020). One publication (No authors listed, 2020) described 25 noti ﬁcations of peripheral neuropathy attributed to vitamin B6-containing products that the French Health Products Agency had received between 1986 and 2018.The products contained between 5 and 250 mg vitamin B6 and wereconsumed between 8 days and 4 years.There was no information on the actual doses taken.In ‘just under 10 individuals ’(as reported in the publication), vitamin B6 was consumed in the form of a combination of vitamins and minerals.Individuals did not consume other medicinal products that couldhave caused neuropathy.The data from the Dutch nutrivigilance system described by No authors listed (2020), van Hunsel et al.(2018) and Vrolijk et al.(2020) were also made available to EFSA as full data set.
Between 2007 and 2022, 191 cases 20of individuals who had experienced symptoms of neuropathy following supplemental vitamin B6 intake have been noti ﬁed to the Dutch vigilance database. Of these, 10 were submitted by a physician, 7 by a pharmacist and the remaining 174 by consumers.In 76 cases, eitherthe associated plasma PLP concentrations were reported, or a statement was available that theconcentrations were elevated.There was no information on how neuropathy was diagnosed.For 47cases the doses consumed, the latency times and the associated plasma PLP concentrations wereavailable, which were considered the most reliable cases.Supplemental doses ranged from 1.4 mg/day 20The full dataset submitted to EFSA contained 234 entries.Cases with symptoms not necessarily indicative of neuropathy were not included in the description of the data set.Tolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 26 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 to 209 mg/day.
Forty-one cases had taken supplemental vitamin B6 at doses ≤100 mg/day, three 125 mg/day for 5 days to 6 months and three between 200 and 209 mg/day for 2 weeks to 3 years.Table 6provides an overview of those cases who had consumed vitamin B6 supplements in amounts ≤100 mg/day. The Panel notes the absence of information on the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy, on the habitual diet of the individuals and on the actual (measured) concentrations of vitamin B6 inthe consumed products (vs the labelled content).The Panel also notes that reported plasma PLPconcentrations are likely not comparable owing to differences in the timing of blood sampling since thelast supplemental intake.Finally, the Panel notes the uncertainties that are associated with self- reported data.
Upon request from EFSA, other Member States ’authorities also provided information on adverse effects reported to national vigilance systems or national authorities in relation to vitamin B6supplementation: Finland reported adverse effects at doses of 50 mg/day and beyond, but no cases of peripheral neuropathy at doses below the current UL of 25 mg/day. Luxembourg and Denmark reported no noti ﬁed cases of peripheral neuropathy.France, through its nutrivigilance system, reported eight cases of neuropathy, all below the current UL of 25 mg/day, of which one at an intake of 21 mg/day with a latency period of1 month with the causality judged to be likely.The other cases were related to a single intakeof 13.3 mg and to intakes below 2.5 mg/day with latency periods between 1 day and1 month, rated as likely or possible.
The causality ratings do not refer to vitamin B6 only, butto the combination of ingredients present in the products that had been consumed by the individuals.Table 6: Overview about individuals who had reported symptoms of neuropathy following supplemental vitamin B6 intakes ≤100 mg/day reported in the Dutch nutrivigilance system Dose Cases Latency PLP concentrationsSymptoms, diagnosis (as reported) 100 mg/day 3( 1M ,2F ) (2 reported by consumers, 1by physician)7 d, 2 y, 18 y Reported to be above normal (2 cases), 3,266 nmol/L (exposure: 7 d)Tingling in feed and hands, pain, neuropathy 74–75 mg/day 5( 1M ,4F ) (all reportedby consumers)2w ,2m , 3m ,1 6m ,6y190 nmol/L (exposure: 2 m) to 2,500 nmol/L (exposure: 6 y)Neuropathy, neurologic symptoms, pain under thefeet after short walking 40–50 mg/day 5( 2M ,3F ) (4 reported by consumers, 1by physician)6m ,1y ,2y , 4y ,1 0yAround 330 nmol/L (exposure; 6 m, 4 y, 10 y) to 4,338 nmol/L (exposure 2 y)Neuropathy, numbness, paraesthesia of limbs 25–28 mg/day 5( 1M ,4F ) (4 reported byconsumers, 1 by pharmacist)10 d, 2 m, 3 y4y ,6y88 nmol/L (exposure: 10 d) to 2,200 nmol/L (exposure: 6 y)Neuropathy, tingling of extremities 12–21 mg/day 7( 1M ,6F ) (6 reported by consumers, 1 by physician)3w ,3m , 11 m, 1 y, 5 y, 15 y, 20 yReported to be above normal (2 cases), 336 nmol/L (exposure: 5 y) to 3,600 nmol/L (exposure: 11 m)Neuropathy, nerve damage, paraesthesia, muscular weakness 5–8 mg/day 5( 5F ) (all reported by consumers)3m ,1 0m , 1 y (2x), 15 mReported to be above normal (1 case), 158 nmol/L (exposure: 3 m) to 1,110 nmol/L (exposure:15 m)Neuropathy, paraesthesia, muscle weakness, nerve pain 1.4–3.5 mg/day 11 (3 M, 8 F) (all reported by consumers)12 h, 1 m, 5m ,6m (5x), 8 m,3y ,2 3yReported to be above normal (2 cases), 158 nmol/L (exposure: 6m )t o >1,200 nmol/L (exposure: 5 m), most were in the range of 200 –400 nmol/LNeuropathy, numbness of extremities, tingling in hands, pain in hands, paraesthesia D: days; F: female; h: hour; M: male; m: month(s); y: year(s).Tolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 27 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 The Panel considers that there is evidence that symptoms of peripheral neuropathy may occur at supplemental vitamin B6 intakes that are below the RP of 100 mg/day used by the SCF (2000) toestablish the UL.
The information provided in the individual publications (Dalton, 1985; Dalton and Dalton, 1987; Blackburn and Warren, 2017) and the data from Member States ’vigilance systems either reported in publications (van Hunsel et al., 2018; No authors listed, 2020; Vrolijk et al., 2020) or made available toEFSA by Member States ’authorities are limited and mostly insuf ﬁcient to verify the causal link between vitamin B6 intake at the consumed doses and the development of neuropathy symptoms. However, for drawing conclusions the following observations are to be considered: In the case –control study by Dalton and Dalton (1987), 48% of women who had taken vitamin B6 supplements at doses <50 mg/day for more than 6 months (the lowest dose group) showed symptoms of neuropathy and the percentage of women affected increased with increasing doses.A woman developed symptoms of peripheral neuropathy for the second time after having taken 50 mg/day supplemental vitamin B6 for 4 months.
This was following recovery fromneuropathy that had originally developed after consumption of 75 mg/day vitamin B6 for2 years (Dalton and Dalton, 1987). There is uncertainty whether vitamin B6 plasmaconcentrations had returned to normal between the two episodes.However, there was 1 yearbetween the easing and reoccurrence of symptoms.A man developed neuropathy (Blackburn and Warren, 2017) following energy drink consumption.These energy drinks had provided a total of 31 mg/day vitamin B6.However, information on the latency period, the overall duration of consumption, the composition of theimplicated energy drink other than vitamin B6 and other dietary habits is lacking.Dalton (1985) reports that 23 women with symptoms of neuropathy had consumed between50 and 300 mg/day vitamin B6.It is unclear if these cases partly or fully overlap with thecases described by Dalton and Dalton (1987) and it is unknown how many women hadconsumed the dose of 50 mg/day.
The Dutch nutrivigilance system reports that 33 cases for which information on both the dose and the latency period were available had taken supplements that contained ≤50 mg/day vitamin B6. The French nutrivigilance system indicates cases of peripheral neuropathy occurring atsupplemental intakes <25 mg/day.The national competent Authority of Finland reports adverse effects at supplemental intakes of 50 mg/day and above.The Panel notes that taken together the evidence indicates that symptoms may occur at daily supplemental vitamin B6 intakes of 50 mg.The Panel additionally notes the large interindividualdifferences in sensitivity to vitamin B6 toxicity described by Hadtstein and Vrolijk (2021).The Panel also notes that plasma PLP concentrations show large interindividual variability in response to vitamin B6 supplementation as evidenced by the intervention study by Berger et al.(1992).
In this study, plasma PLP concentrations were 80 nmol/L following consumption of supplemental vitamin B6 of 12 mg/kg bw per day for 24 months in one individual, 650 nmol/L whenthe same amount was consumed for 7 months in another individual, 300 nmol/L with a supplementalvitamin B6 intake of 19.5 mg/kg bw per day for 4.5 months and 750 nmol/L with a supplementalintake of 26.5 mg/kg bw per day for 3.5 months (one individual each). The Panel concludes that the evidence allows establishing with suf ﬁcient certainty that peripheral neuropathy may occur at supplemental vitamin B6 intakes of 50 mg/day in some individuals.3.5.1.2.Evidence from animal studies relating vitamin B6 intake to peripheral neuropathy The description of the evidence in relation to animal studies that relate vitamin B6 intake to neuropathy is based on a narrative review of the evidence (Tetens et al., 2023).Only studies thatinvestigated oral intake of vitamin B6 were considered.
Studies in rats Only a few studies have been conducted in rats, in which vitamin B6 was provided orally. However, even at doses of 1,400 –1,750 mg PN-HCl/kg diet (recommended intake for rats 7 mg/kg diet) given for 6 –10 weeks, no signs of peripheral neuropathy were reported (Schaeffer et al., 1989; Schaeffer et al., 1995).It should be noted that the studies were not designed to look at this endpoint.In aTolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 28 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 previous review, doses of 3,000 –6,000 mg/kg bw per day were described to induce symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (e.g.ataxia) in rats (Cohen and Bendich, 1986).Studies in dogs Beagle dogs have a urinary excretion of vitamin B6 that is similar to humans in terms of metabolites and total vitamin B6 excreted in urine (Scudi et al., 1942).
Beagle dogs have been widelyused to investigate vitamin B6 toxicity (Montpetit et al., 1988) and seven studies were available for thepresent assessment. The Panel notes the absence of a control group in all studies, except in one (Phillips et al., 1978).In one study in 10 Beagle dogs ( ﬁve males, ﬁve females; age range: 13 –15 months), PN-HCl was administered at doses of 50 mg/kg bw per day for the ﬁrst week, 100 mg/kg bw per day for the second week and 150 mg/kg bw per day from the 15th day to the end of the experimental period at100–112 days.Neurological symptoms with signs of ataxia and gait abnormalities developed from day 18 of treatment onwards (Hoover and Carlton, 1981).Dogs had degenerative lesions in the dorsalfuniculus, the trigeminal nerve ﬁbres and the spinal tracts of the trigeminal nerves with a reduced number of axons and irregular and fragmented myelin (Hoover and Carlton, 1981).
In another study by the same authors testing the same PN doses administered for the same duration in three Beagle dogs, similar results were obtained (Hoover et al., 1981). Degeneration in thedorsal funiculus, the dorsal spinal roots, some fascicles of peripheral nerves, the spinal tracts of thetrigeminal nerves and the trigeminal nerve ﬁbres was observed.In the dorsal funiculus, degeneration of axons, loss of axons, collapse of myelin sheaths, degeneration and loss of myelin and astrocyticscarring occurred.The authors concluded that vitamin B6 produced axonal degeneration followed bynonspeci ﬁc secondary degenerative changes in myelin.Montpetit et al.(1988) administered 150 or 200 mg/kg bw per day PN-HCl to 6 and 4 Beagle dogs (age range: 6 –9 months), respectively.Signs of peripheral neuropathy started after 7 –10 days of treatment and appeared at both dose levels.The ﬁndings suggested that the initial lesions occur in the soma of neurons of the dorsal root ganglia.
Vacuoles appeared in the cytoplasm of large neurons,eventually substantially reducing the cytoplasm. This happened ﬁrst in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia followed by the thoracic and cervical ones.In dorsal root, sciatic and sural nerves, an activebreakdown of myelin, proportional in degree to the duration of vitamin B6 treatment, was observed.Evaluation of tissues evidenced that the unmyelinated processes of neurons in the dorsal root gangliawere swollen because of an accumulation of neuro ﬁlaments.Both in the soma and in the proximal myelinated processes, neuro ﬁlament microtubules were dissociated.The authors proposed that this cytoskeletal disruption was due to an increased rate of protein synthesis and that the vacuolar changeswere probably a secondary reaction to the damaged cell processes.
Oral administration of vitamin B6 (300 mg/kg bw per day) to six Beagle dogs (7 –11 months old) for 78 days induced gait abnormalities 4 –9 days after beginning of treatment, and severe ataxia 8–30 days after start of treatment (Krinke et al., 1981). Morphological abnormalities were detected in neurons and processes of dorsal root and the trigeminal ganglia.Vacuoles appeared in the cytoplasmthat over time reduced the cytoplasm to a small rim.Axon degeneration was present in dorsal roots, dorsal columns of the spinal cord, in the descending tract from the trigeminal nerve and in scattered ﬁbres of trigeminal nerves with the most severe changes occurring in the sural nerve.Even in the most compromised nerves, normal ﬁbres interspersed with damaged ones.Schaeppi and Krinke (1982) provided 3,000 mg/day PN-HCl (between 250 and 315 mg/kg bw per day, depending on the dog ’s body weight) to two female Beagle dogs for 8 and 26 days, respectively.
Gait impairment started on day 6 in one dog and on day 20 in the other. There was selective damageof large, ﬁrst-order sensory neurons.Dorsal root ganglia showed a loss of dorsal root neurons as evidenced by an increased number of satellite cells.In the dorsal spinal roots and peripheral nerves, there was a decrease in the number of large, myelinated nerve ﬁbres, but no degeneration was visible.A number of ﬁbres were swollen and contained myelin fragments and shrunken ﬁbre remnants.Another study by the same authors tested a dose of PN-HCl of 300 mg/kg bw per day consumed for 10 –20 days by three dogs.The dogs had chronically implanted cortical electrodes (age range: 12–37 months) which showed impaired slow impulse transmission and a lesser effect on the faster one (Schaeppi and Krinke, 1985).
In a study in Beagle dogs with a control group (Phillips et al., 1978), the toxicity of different oral doses of PN-HCl (0, 50 or 200 mg/kg bw per day) was tested (n = 14 in total; n = 4 for control group; n = 5 for each treatment group; age range: 7 –8 months) for 100 –114 days (average: 107 days). Animals were randomly assigned to the three groups and were fed a nutritionally balancedTolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 29 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 commercially available diet.Two dogs were housed in each pen.PN-HCl was administered in gelatine capsules.The ‘high-dose ’group initially received 250 mg/kg bw per day for a week, but as all dogs developed incoordination and ataxia, the dose was reduced to 200 mg/kg bw per day.Clinicalexaminations were carried out once per month and neurological assessments at biweekly intervals.Dogs in the ‘high-dose ’group lost weight within the ﬁrst week of treatment.
The weight was not recovered during the duration of the study. There was also an increase in heart rate in this group fromon average 118 beats per minute pre-treatment to 160 beats per minute after 8 days of treatmentwhich remained at this level until the end of the study.The signs that had been experienced by the dogs in the ‘high-dose ’group within the ﬁrst week disappeared within another week after the dose had been reduced to 200 mg/kg bw per day and reappeared between 40 to 75 days after the start ofthe study with 100% of animals affected.Ataxic gait, muscular weakness and loss of balance were theﬁrst signs to appear.The neurological impairment increased in severity with time until they were so marked that dogs had dif ﬁculties in standing.Histological ﬁndings showed a pronounced loss of myelin and axons in the dorsal fasciculi throughout the entire length of the spinal cord and loss of myelin andnerve ﬁbre degeneration in the dorsal sensory nerve roots.
In the ‘low-dose ’group, signs of neurological disease did not develop, and they did not show lesions in the dorsal fasciculi. However, all ﬁve dogs in the group showed bilateral loss of myelin in the dorsal sensory nerve roots.No lesions were found in the control animals.The Panel considers that this study shows that supplementalvitamin B6 intake of 50 mg/kg bw per day in Beagle dogs for around 107 days leads to limiteddamage in the dorsal sensory nerve roots without the occurrence of symptoms of neurological disease.The Panel concludes that the study by Phillips et al.(1978) provides evidence for a LOAEL of 50 mg/kg bw per day in Beagle dogs.The Panel also concludes that the studies in Beagle dogs suggest that high vitamin B6 intake damages afferent nerves mostly through axon degeneration, myelin breakdown and vacuolisation of cytoplasm, with initial lesions mostly occurring in the dorsal root ganglia.3.5.1.3.
Mechanisms of toxicity Hadtstein and Vrolijk (2021) recently reviewed four prevailing theories on the potential mechanisms by which high intakes of vitamin B6 could cause peripheral neuropathy. These have been summarisedby the Tetens et al.(2023) based on Hadtstein and Vrolijk (2021) and are described in the following: PL and PLP each contain an aldehyde group.Aldehydes are highly reactive and capable of altering structures and functions of macromolecules such as proteins and DNA (LoPachin and Gavin, 2014), notnecessarily con ﬁned to neurons.In contrast to PLP , PL can exist in both aldehyde and hemiacetal forms.However, at neutral pH, such as in the human body, almost all PL is found in hemiacetal formwhich is not chemically reactive (Ink et al., 1982).PLP , on the other hand, could exert aldehydetoxicity.However, it is bound to protein in plasma and the body possesses mechanisms that counteract the accumulation of PLP (Hadtstein and Vrolijk, 2021).
In a study in Lewis rats, it was observed that intraperitoneal injections of PL-HCl, PLP and PM-2HCl did not lead to clinical signs of neurotoxicity norto histological lesions, while the injection of PN-HCl did (Levine and Saltzman, 2004). The Panelconsiders that it is unlikely that the aldehyde groups of PL or PLP are responsible for neurotoxic effectsof vitamin B6.It has been suggested that quinone methide-type intermediates could be involved in the generation of adverse effects of vitamin B6.Quinone-methides possess electrophilic reactivity and can alkylatemolecules (Hadtstein and Vrolijk, 2021).It has been shown in vitro that methide-type intermediates that can be formed by irradiation of PN (Brousmiche and Wan, 2002).It has been proposed that they could potentially also be formed in vivo through enzymatic reaction (Frater-Schr €oder and Mahrer- Busato, 1975).Quinone methide-type intermediates are expected to exert broad toxicological activity,not only con ﬁned to neurons.
The Panel considers that is unlikely that quinone methide-type intermediates are responsible for neurotoxic effects of vitamin B6. As PN and/or PNP may form chemical complexes that hinder PLP from to binding to target enzymes, it has been proposed that high concentrations of PN in plasma may lead to vitamin B6deﬁciency.In animal models, neuropathy is one of the manifested symptoms (Vrolijk et al., 2017).However, symptoms of neuropathy caused by vitamin B6 toxicity do not fully overlap with symptoms of vitamin B6 de ﬁciency (Hadtstein and Vrolijk, 2021).Mutations of the gene expressing pyridoxal kinase predominantly lead to injury of sensory neurons, causing axonal neuropathy and producing symptoms similar to vitamin B6-induced neuropathy(Hadtstein and Vrolijk, 2021).
High concentrations of PN may lead to inhibition of pyridoxal kinase inTolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 30 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 tissues with low PLP oxidase activity and thus to a depletion in PLP . Compounds that lead to inhibition of pyridoxal kinase have shown to inhibit c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) biosynthesis and GABAergic neurotransmission (Kasaragod et al., 2020).The presynaptic inhibition of GABA leads to an increasedexcitability of dorsal root ganglia neurons (Vargas-Parada et al., 2021).It is known that overactivationof excitatory neurotransmitters result in degeneration of neurons (King et al., 2007) and it is plausiblethat the increased excitability of the dorsal root ganglia neurons could be the cause for thedevelopment of peripheral neuropathy.In addition, PLP is involved in the biosynthesis of most otherneurotransmitters that may also contribute to the effect.
It should, however, be noted that neurological symptoms caused by pyridoxal kinase de ﬁciency or inhibition respond to vitamin B6 supplementation and that neuropathy caused by vitamin B6 intoxication does not affect all peripheralnerves to the same extent (Hadtstein and Vrolijk, 2021). The Panel notes that some hypotheses have been put forward with respect to potential mechanisms by which high vitamin B6 intakes could lead to peripheral neuropathy, but the causalmechanisms are still unknown.3.5.1.4.Conclusions on the evidence on the relationship between high vitamin B6 intakes and peripheral neuropathy The Panel concludes that there is evidence from human studies that peripheral neuropathy may occur at supplemental vitamin B6 intakes of 50 mg/day in some individuals.
A subchronic study in Beagle dogs showed that supplemental vitamin B6 intakes of 50 mg/kg bw per day for around 107 days leads to limited damage in the dorsal sensory nerve roots without theoccurrence of symptoms of neurological disease and provides evidence for a LOAEL of 50 mg/kg bwper day. Studies in Beagle dogs have shown that high vitamin B6 intake damages afferent nerves mostly through axon degeneration, myelin breakdown and vacuolisation of cytoplasm, with initial lesions mostly occurring in the dorsal root ganglia.Several proposed mechanisms have been put forward by which vitamin B6 may cause neurotoxicity, but the causal mechanisms are still unknown.3.5.2.Developmental toxicity In its evaluation of the UL for vitamin B6, the SCF (2000) indicated that there was a lack of data on the neuronal toxicity of excess vitamin B6 intakes during development of the nervous system.
The IOM (1998) noted isolated, uncontrolled case reports of congenital defects (Donaldson and Bury, 1982; Gardner et al., 1985; Philpot et al., 1995) and B6 dependency (Hunt et al., 1954) innewborn infants whose mothers were treated with vitamin B6 during the ﬁrst half of pregnancy. In the study by Donaldson and Bury (1982), women used a supplement during pregnancy that contained10 mg vitamin B6, but the daily exposure is unclear.In the study by Gardner et al.(1985), vitamin B6 was supplemented in amounts of 50 mg/day for the ﬁrst 7 months of pregnancy.Hunt Jr.et al.(1954) administered 50 mg vitamin B6 intramuscularly 3 –4 times per week during the second to ﬁfth months of pregnancy.In the publication by Philpot et al.(1995), the exposure is not speci ﬁed.Observational data in women taking up to 200 mg/day vitamin B6 orally (Weinstein et al., 1944; Ellis, 1987) duringtheﬁrst trimester of pregnancy suggested no adverse effects.
The SCF (2000) and IOM (1998) noted that studies in rats and monkeys (Schumacher et al., 1965; Khera, 1975; Hendrickx et al., 1985) had shown no evidence of teratogenicity. In the following, the evidence retrieved through the systematic review is described.The evidence table is in Appendix D.2.3.5.2.1.Congenital anomalies Intervention study One eligible intervention study was retrieved through the systematic search that assessed the effect of vitamin B6 supplementation on congenital anomalies (Shahraki et al., 2016).Shahraki et al.(2016) conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effect of ondansetron (n = 88), a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with PN-HCl supplementation (40 mg/day vitamin B6, n = 100) in pregnant women suffering from nausea and vomiting.Supplementationwas initiated between 4 and 16 weeks of gestation and women were followed-up until birth.Nocongenital anomalies were observed.
The Panel notes that this study does not show an effect ofTolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 31 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 vitamin B6 supplementation, initiated between 4 and 16 weeks of gestation, in amounts of 40 mg/day on congenital anomalies. Observational studies on heart malformations Prospective cohort study Shrim et al.(2006) recruited 96 pregnant women with a vitamin B6 intake of >50 mg/day during theﬁrst trimester of pregnancy and a control group (n = 96) with usual vitamin B6 intake.The mean (/C6SD) duration of supplementation was 9 /C64.2 weeks with a mean dose of 132.3 /C674 mg/day (range 50 –510 mg/day).There was one major heart malformation (not further speci ﬁed) in the supplement group and none in the control group.
The Panel notes that the incidence of congenitalheart defects in the general population lies between 0.4% and 5% of all live births (Hoffman andKaplan, 2002; Marelli et al., 2007) and that the incidence in the study by Shrim et al. (2006) falls within this background risk, which does not allow the case observed in this study to be attributed to vitamin B6 supplementation.Case –control studies Zhang et al.(2021) included 396 newborn infants with non-syndromic coronary heart defects and their mothers and 792 controls after propensity score matching to account for the imbalances incovariates between cases and controls.Dietary intake of vitamin B6, including supplements, duringpregnancy was assessed by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).It was adjusted in the analysis for total energy intake using the residual method.
There was a non-signi ﬁcantly increased risk of neonatal coronary heart defects in the third tertile of total vitamin B6 intake as compared withtheﬁrst tertile (median 3.1 vs 1.7 mg/day; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.16 (95% con ﬁdence interval (CI) 0.83, 1.62), adjusted for total intake of other studied nutrients). Vitamin B6 intake from diet onlywas not associated with coronary heart defects.The Panel notes that total vitamin B6 intake in thisstudy was within the intake range that can be expected from a habitual diet and that it is unlikely thatthe cases observed in the study can be attributed to the vitamin B6 intake of pregnant women, inparticular as studies investigating higher vitamin B6 intakes have not observed an association.Shaw et al.
(2014) investigated the association between vitamin B6 status at mid-pregnancy and increased risk for cono-truncal heart defects ascertained through medical records and con ﬁrmed with instrumental checks in 420 mother-infant pairs (140 cases, 280 controls). When using plasma PLPconcentrations as marker of exposure, there was a non-signi ﬁcant lower risk of developing cono-truncal heart defects associated with the ﬁrst (<31.16 nmol/L) or the third ( ≥80.01 nmol/L) tertile compared with the second (31.16 –80 nmol/L), i.e.OR (95% CI) 0.7 (0.4 –1.2) and 0.7 (0.4 –1.3), respectively (linear trend: p = 0.93).Using plasma PL concentrations, there was a non-signi ﬁcant lower risk of developing cono-truncal heart defects associated with the ﬁrst tertile ( <16.86 nmol/L) compared with the second (16.86 –49.56 nmol/L), i.e.OR (95% CI) 0.7 (0.4 –1.3) and no association when comparing the third ( ≥49.57 nmol/L) with the second, i.e.OR (95% CI) 1.0 (0.6 –1.7) (linear trend: p = 0.28).
For plasma PA concentrations, there was a non-signi ﬁcant lower risk of developing cono-truncal heart defects associated with the ﬁrst (<14.37 nmol/L) or the third tertile ( ≥47.43 nmol/L) compared with the second (14.37 –47.42 nmol/L), i.e. OR (95% CI) 0.6 (0.3 –1.1) and 0.9 (0.5 –1.5), respectively (linear trend: p = 0.29).These analyses were adjusted for maternal race and maternal age.The Panel notesthat this study does not show a positive association between markers of vitamin B6 exposure and cono-truncal heart defects.Observational studies on other malformationsCase –control studies Czeizel et al.(2004) used data from the Hungarian Case – Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities study.Cases of congenital abnormalities were retrieved from the Hungarian CongenitalAbnormality Register, while matched controls were drawn from the National Birth Registry.A totalnumber of 22,843 cases and 38,151 controls were identi ﬁed.
Vitamin B6 supplements during pregnancy were consumed by 2,013 mothers of cases and 4,086 mothers of controls. Supplementswere taken mostly during the second and third months of pregnancy at a dose of 60 mg/day becauseof nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.They were consumed for a mean duration of 2.5 months inthe case group and 2.8 months in the control group.The likelihood of having taken vitamin B6 supplements during pregnancy was lower in cases than controls (aOR 0.8 (95% CI 0.7, 0.9).This also applied when supplementation during the ﬁrst month and supplementation during the second andTolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 32 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 third month were considered separately.None of the 24 individual congenital abnormalities were signi ﬁcantly associated with a higher likelihood of taking vitamin B6 supplements.
The Panel notes that this study does not show an association between the consumption of vitamin B6 supplements at adose of 60 mg/day during the ﬁrst 3 months of pregnancy and congenital abnormalities. Goodman et al.(2019) matched cases of fetal gastroschisis at 24 gestational weeks (n = 30) to controls (n = 76) by race and maternal age.When adjusting for insurance, education, low body massindex (BMI) and nulliparity, this risk of gastroschisis in the fetus was non-signi ﬁcantly lower in mothers with a serum vitamin B6 (compound unspeci ﬁed) concentration ≥5lg/L at the second trimester of pregnancy compared with <5lg/L (OR 0.55 (95% CI 0.04, 9.1)).In the unadjusted analysis, the risk estimates were inverted (OR 1.23 (0.18, 14.29)).The Panel notes that this study does not show apositive association between markers of vitamin B6 exposure and fetal gastroschisis.
The outcome of the studies reporting on congenital anomalies is summarised in Table 7.Tolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 33 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 Table 7: Summary of outcome of studies on congenital anomalies ReferenceStudy designExposureTime of exposureCompound UnitExposure highExposure lowN exp.highN exp. lowOutcomeOR (95%CI)Cases exp.highCases exp.lowAdjusted Shahraki et al.(2016)RCT Supple- mentationFrom 4 –16 gw onwardsPyridoxine HClmg/ day40 Ondansetron 100 88 Congenital anomaliesNA 0 0 No Shrim et al.(2006)PC Supple- mentationDuring 1st trimesterPyridoxine HClmg/ day50–150 NR 96 96 Major heart malformationNA 1 0 No Zhang et al.(2021)CC Intake During pregnancyDietary intakemg/ day3.1 1.7 396 396 Non- syndromiccoronaryheart defects1.16 (0.83,1.62)Yes Shaw et al.(2014)CC Plasma Drawn at mid pregnancyPLP nmo l/L≥80.01 31.16 –80 138 138 Cono-truncal heart defects0.7 (0.4, 1.3)33 78 Yes Shaw et al.

The Panel notes that the incidence of congenital heart defectsin the general population lies between 0.4 and 5% of all live births (Hoffman and Kaplan, 2002; Marelliet al., 2007) and that the incidence in the study by Shrim et al. (2006) falls within this backgroundrisk, which does not allow the case observed in this study to be attributed to vitamin B6supplementation.In a case –control study (Zhang et al., 2021), there was a non-signi ﬁcant increase in the risk of non-syndromic coronary heart defects in infants of women who had consumed 3.1 mg/day vitamin B6 during pregnancy compared with those who had consumed 1.7 mg/day (aOR 1.16 (95% CI0.83, 1.62)).The Panel notes that the vitamin B6 intake in this study was within the range that isachieved by habitual diets, and it is unlikely that cases in this study can be attributed to the vitamin B6intake of pregnant women, in particular as studies investigating higher vitamin B6 intakes have notobserved an association.
No congenital malformations occurred in an RCT in which pregnant womenconsumed 40 mg/day vitamin B6 as PN-HCl or ondansetron from 4 –16 gestational weeks onwards (Shahraki et al., 2016). Three case –control studies (Czeizel et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2014; Goodman et al., 2019), among those one that included around 23,000 cases of congenital anomalies of all kind and 38,000 controls (Czeizel et al., 2004), did not show an increased risk of congenital malformationsfollowing vitamin B6 intakes of up to 60 mg/day.The Panel considers that the available evidence from both intervention and observational studies does not suggest a positive relationship between vitamin B6 intake and congenital anomalies inhumans over the range of exposure investigated.3.5.2.2.
Growth restriction in utero With respect to growth restriction in utero , two prospective observational studies (Furness et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015) as well as two case –control studies (Baker et al., 1977; Salcedo-Bellido et al., 2017) were retrieved through the systematic search. The outcomes that were investigated in thestudies were intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (Furness et al., 2013), the risk of an infant beingborn as small-for-gestational age (SGA) (Chen et al., 2015) and the risk of a term infant being bornwith a low birth weight between 1,500 and <2,500 g (Baker et al., 1977).IUGR was de ﬁned in the pertinent study as serial tapering of growth in abdominal circumference and of estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile for their gestational age (Furness et al., 2013).
SGA infants were de ﬁned as infants who were born with a weight that was below the 10th percentile for their gestational age (Chen et al., 2015) or were not further de ﬁned (Salcedo-Bellido et al., 2017). However, as the de ﬁnition used by Chen et al.(2015) is the most widely used de ﬁnition (Schlaudecker et al., 2017), it is likely that it also applies to the study described by Salcedo-Bellido et al.(2017).Eventhough IUGR and SGA are often considered as interchangeable, being born SGA is not necessarily aresult of a pathological growth restriction but may re ﬂect a genetic predisposition of the infant to be constitutionally light weight.In the following, the studies are described.Prospective observational studies Furness et al.(2013) followed 137 pregnant women recruited from a high-risk pregnancy clinic and from a routine antenatal clinic in whom aspartate aminotransferase activity coef ﬁcient, a measure of vitamin B6 status, was analysed in RBCs at gestational weeks 18 –22.
The aspartate aminotransferase activity coef ﬁcient was somewhat higher in the group in whom IUGR developed (n = 21) compared with normal pregnancy group (n = 63; mean (unadjusted), 95% CI; 50%, 45 –55% vs 41.9%, 38–46%)), indicating a lower vitamin B6 status in the group with IUGR. The Panel notes that this study does not show a positive association between markers of vitamin B6 exposure and the risk of developing IUGR.Using data from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study, Chen et al.(2015) investigated the relationship between plasma vitamin B6 status at gestational weeks26–28 (compound measured unspeci ﬁed) and the risk of the infant being born SGA in 968 mother- infant pairs.There was no association between log-transformed maternal vitamin B6 status and therisk of being born SGA (aOR per one SD higher log vitamin B6 plasma concentration 0.98 (95% CI0.79, 1.22)).
The analyses were adjusted for infant sex, ethnicity, maternal age, gravidity, maternal height, pre-pregnancy BMI, weight gain until 26 weeks, educational level and gestational diabetes mellitus. Median (interquartile range; IQR) plasma vitamin B6 concentrations at 26 –28 gestationalTolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 35 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 weeks were 61.8 (25.9 –113) nmol/L.The Panel notes that this study does not show a positive association between markers of vitamin B6 exposure and the risk of being born SGA.Case –control studies A matched case –control study was conducted by Salcedo-Bellido et al.(2017) in 518 mothers of infants born SGA and 518 controls.
Vitamin B6 intake during pregnancy was estimated by a FFQ.Mothers in the highest quintile of vitamin B6 intake ( >2.9 mg/day) had a lower risk of giving birth to an infant who was SGA compared with the ﬁrst quintile ( <1.9 mg/day) (aOR (95% CI 0.69 (0.43, 1.08), but this did not reach statistical signi ﬁcance. The analysis was adjusted for energy intake, preeclampsia, education level, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking, weight gain per week during pregnancy,and previous preterm/low-birth-weight newborn infant.The Panel notes that this study does not showa positive association between vitamin B6 intake and the risk if being born SGA.Baker et al.(1977) reported that, in a matched case –control study, neither whole blood vitamin B6 concentrations (compound not reported) of the mother 30 min post-partum nor cord blood concentrations were related to low birth weight for term deliveries.
The study included 50 mother-infant pairs with normal birth weight infants and the same number of mother-infant pairs with low birth weight of the infant (1,500 –2,500 g). Whole blood vitamin B6 concentrations were 0.5 ng/mL (CI not available) higher in mothers of infants with a low birthweight and in cord blood it was 0.4 ng/mL.The difference was not statistically signi ﬁcant.The Panel notes that even though a higher vitamin B6 exposure in this study was associated with low-birth weight of infants, this association was notstatistically signi ﬁcant.
The Panel notes that only one case –control study in 50 cases and 50 controls (Baker et al., 1977) reports a non-statistically signi ﬁcant higher vitamin B6 exposure to be associated with low-birth weight of infants, while the other three studies (Furness et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015; Salcedo-Bellido et al., 2017) with larger sample sizes, two of which were prospective cohort studies, did not show an association between vitamin B6 exposure and growth restriction in utero . The Panel considers that the available evidence from observational studies does not suggest a positive relationship between vitamin B6 intake and growth restriction in utero in humans over the range of exposure investigated.3.5.2.3.Birth weight and length Birth weight and length could be used as surrogate markers of impaired fetal growth if biologically relevant lower birth weights are consistently associated with higher vitamin B6 intakes.
Two RCTs (Schuster et al., 1984; Shahraki et al., 2016), ﬁve prospective cohort studies (de Weerd et al., 2003; Lagiou et al., 2005; Shrim et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2015; McCullough et al., 2016) andone cross-sectional study (Chang, 1999) investigated the relationship between vitamin B6 exposureand birth weight and birth length and were initially considered pertinent. During the assessment, thebiologically implausible range of PLP concentrations reported in the publication by McCulloughet al.(2016) was noted and this study was subsequently excluded from the evaluation.The remaining seven studies are described in the following.Intervention studies Shahraki et al.(2016), described in Section 3.5.2.1 , conducted a RCT comparing the effect of ondansetron (n = 88), a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, vs PN-HCl supplementation (40 mg/dayvitamin B6, n = 100) in pregnant women suffering from nausea and vomiting.
Supplementation wasinitiated between 4 and 16 weeks of gestation and women were followed-up until birth. There were nodifferences in birth weight (2,950 /C6457 g (SD, vitamin B6 group) vs 3,007 /C6442 g (ondansetron group)) and birth length (49.5 /C61.5 cm vs 49.0 /C61.5 cm) between groups.The Panel notes that this study does not show an effect of vitamin B6 supplementation, initiated between 4 and 16 weeks of gestation, in amounts of 40 mg/day on birth weight and birth length.In the RCT by Schuster et al.(1984), 196 pregnant women were supplemented with 0, 2.1, 4.1, 6.2, 8.2, 12.3 or 16.5 mg pyridoxine equivalents (equivalent to 0, 2.6, 5, 7.5, 10, 15 or 20 mg PN-HCl), starting between gestational weeks 6 and 21.Only 46 women at 30 weeks of gestation and22 individuals at birth fully complied with the protocol and were included in the analysis.
Therewere no differences in birth weight (3,287 g /C6429 (SD) vs 3,240 /C6505 g) and birth length (50.7 /C62.1 cm vs 50.9 /C62.7 cm) between the groups receiving 7.5 –20 mg/day compared with the groups getting 0 –5 mg/day. The Panel notes the high non-compliance rate in this study and that thisTolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 36 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 study did not show an effect of vitamin B6 supplementation, initiated between 6 and 21 weeks of gestation in amounts of up to 16.5 mg/day, on birth weight and birth length.The Panel considers that the available evidence from RCTs does not suggest an inverse relationship between vitamin B6 intake and birth weight in humans over the range of exposure investigated.Observational studies Prospective observational studies .Chen et al.
(2015) (GUSTO study), described in Section 3.5.2.2 , reported no signi ﬁcant association between log-transformed maternal vitamin B6 status at gestational weeks 26 –28 and birth weight (adjusted mean per one SD higher log vitamin B6 plasma concentration (95% CI) -3.9 ( /C030.7, 22.9) g) and birth length ( /C00.08 ( /C00.21, 0.05) cm). The analyses were adjusted for infant sex, ethnicity, maternal age, gravidity, maternal height, pre-pregnancy BMI, weight gain until 26 weeks, educational level and gestational diabetes mellitus.The Panel notes that this study does not show an inverse association between markers of vitamin B6 exposure and birth weight and birth length.Shrim et al.(2006), described in Section 3.5.1.1 , recruited 96 pregnant women with a vitamin B6 intake of >50 mg/day during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy and a control group (n = 96) with usual vitamin B6 intake.
The mean (SD) duration of supplementation was 9 /C64 weeks with a mean dose of 132.3 /C674 mg/day (range 50 –510 mg/day). Birth weight was higher in the group consuming vitamin B6 compared with the group not consuming it (3,542 /C6512 g vs 3,321 /C6562 g, p = 0.01, unadjusted).The Panel notes that this study shows a positive, rather than a negative association, between vitamin B6 intake and birth weight in an unadjusted analysis.Lagiou et al.(2005) investigated the relationship between dietary vitamin B6 intake during the ﬁrst 27 gestational weeks and birth weight and birth length in 222 mother-infant pairs.There were nosigni ﬁcant differences in birth weight and birth length (adjusted mean differences per SD higher vitamin B6 intake 2.7 g (95% CI –54.4, 59.7) and /C00.04 cm ( /C00.32, 0.25), respectively).
The analyses were adjusted for age, education, parity, height, pre-pregnancy BMI, oral contraceptives prior to indexpregnancy, smoking, gender of offspring, exact gestational age at delivery and total energy intake.Median (IQR) vitamin B6 intake from diet and supplements, assessed with a semi-quantitative FFQ, was 4.1 (95% CI 2.6 –5.9) mg/day. The Panel notes that this study does not show an inverse association between vitamin B6 intake and birth weight.de Weerd et al.(2003) found no association between whole blood PLP concentrations in 240 women measured at 6 and 10 gestational weeks and birth weight (results not reported).Median wholeblood PLP concentrations at 6 gestational weeks (n = 188) were 47 (IQR 40 –56) nmol/L.The Panel notes that this study does not show an inverse association between markers of vitamin B6 exposureand birth weight and birth length.
Cross sectional studies Chang (1999) investigated 209 newborn infants whose mothers had been supplemented with 0, 1, 2 or 3 mg/day PN-HCl during pregnancy. The habitual diet, as estimated from a FFQ, provided around1 mg/day vitamin B6.Infants in the highest group of cord blood PLP ( ≥50 nmol/L) were heavier than infants in the lowest group ( <40 nmol/L) (mean /C6SD 3,400 /C6300 g vs.3,000 /C6300 g, p <0.001) and also longer (50.7 /C62.4 vs.48.7 /C61.6), even though the latter difference was not statistically signi ﬁcant.All results were unadjusted.Supplementation was not associated with birth weight and birth length (numerical results not reported in the publication).The Panel notes that this study shows a positive, rather than a negative association, between markers of vitamin B6 exposure and birth weight in an unadjusted analysis.
A summary of the outcome of the studies on birth weight in which exposure was used as categorical variable are given in Table 8and those in which exposure was used as a continuous variable in Table 9.

The cross-sectional study by Chang (1999) also found that infants withhigher vitamin B6 exposure were not only heavier but also longer, while Shrim et al.(2006) did notreport on birth length.
Two RCTs (Schuster et al., 1984; Shahraki et al., 2016) and three prospectivecohort studies (de Weerd et al., 2003; Lagiou et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2015) did not observe vitaminB6 intake or markers of vitamin B6 exposure to be associated with birth weight or birth length, withexposures up to 40 mg/day consumed from 4 –16 gestational weeks onwards in one of the RCTs (Shahraki et al., 2016). The Panel considers that the available evidence from observational studies does not suggest an inverse relationship between vitamin B6 intake and birth weight and birth length in humans over therange of exposures investigated.3.5.2.4.Developmental toxicity in animals Four studies in rats and two studies in pigs were retrieved through the systematic search and are described in the following.Marathe and Thomas (1986) studied four groups of 12 female Wistar rats each.
They were given normal feed or 100, 400 or 800 mg/kg bw per day vitamin B6 in distilled water from days 6 –15 of gestation (period of organogenesis) via water. On day 20 of gestation, the rats were sacri ﬁced.The total number of live pups and their weights were comparable between groups.There were no visceralor skeletal malformations.In another study on female Wister rats (Khera, 1975), rats were fed 0, 20, 40, 60 or 80 mg/kg bw per day vitamin B6 as PN-HCl in water from days 6 –15 of gestation until day 22 when they were sacri ﬁced.The number of pregnant rats per dose group ranged between 16 and 19.fetal weight, the number of live and dead foetuses and resorption sites were similar between groups.
The studies by Alton-Mackey and Walker (1973) and Alton-Mackey and Walker (1978) were designed to study the effect of vitamin B6 de ﬁciency on developmental outcomes, but also included groups of female Wistar rats (n not reported), which were fed 100 or 400% of their vitamin B6requirement from mating until delivery. There was no difference in litter weight (Alton-Mackey andWalker, 1973, 1978) and litter size (Alton-Mackey and Walker, 1973) between groups.Two studies in pigs (Ritchie et al., 1960; Dalto et al., 2016) also did not show an effect of vitamin B6 supplementation on litter weight (Ritchie et al., 1960; Dalto et al., 2016) and size (Ritchie et al., 1960).In the study by Ritchie et al.(1960), pregnant sows (n = 18) and gilts (n = 24) had received either a control diet with a vitamin B6 content that covered requirements ( ~0.9 mg/kg feed) or a diet that contained around 10 mg/kg feed.Sows received 5 kg and gilts 2.5 kg of the feed.Thestudy by Dalto et al.
(2016) in gilts had a factorial design in which both the effect of selenium andvitamin B6 on litter development were tested. The control diet had contained 0.6 mg/kg feed seleniumand 2.4 mg/kg vitamin B6, while the diet high in vitamin B6 had provided 0.6 mg/kg feed seleniumand 12.4 mg/kg vitamin B6.The gilts had been fed with 2.8 kg/day of feed from before pregnancy today 30 after insemination.The Panel notes that the available evidence from animal studies does not suggest a relationship between high vitamin B6 intakes and developmental toxicity.3.5.2.5.Conclusions on the evidence on the relationship between high vitamin B6 intakes and developmental toxicity Overall, the Panel concludes that the available evidence does not suggest a relationship between high vitamin B6 intakes and outcomes indicative of developmental toxicity.3.5.3.
Other adverse health effects Other adverse health effects that have been reported to be associated with high vitamin B6 intakes have been reviewed and summarised by the Tetens et al. (2023) as described in the following.3.5.3.1.Photosensitisation and dermatological lesions Case reports on subepidermal vesicular dermatosis and photosensitive dermatitis, caused by high vitamin B6 intake (2 g and 75 mg PN daily, respectively) have been published (Friedman et al., 1986;Murata et al., 1998).The conditions presented may be induced by the ability of vitamin B6 vitamers toact as photosensitisers, which can cause photooxidative damage upon irradiation as shown in in vitroTolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 40 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 studies (Sato et al., 1993; Maeda et al., 2000; Wondrak et al., 2004; Justiniano et al., 2017).
The photosensitisation ability of vitamin B6 vitamers is assumed to be due to the 3-hydroxypyridinestructure shared among all the vitamers (Wondrak and Jacobson, 2012) and may depend on vitamerand type of irradiation (Wang et al., 2015). 3.5.3.2.Risk of hip fracture An association between high vitamin B6 intake and hip fracture was found in a secondary pooled analysis from two Norwegian RCTs, originally investigating the effect of B-vitamins on cardiovascular disease.For the secondary analysis, trial participant data were linked to a national database for hip fractures.
For individuals consuming vitamin B6 (40 mg PN daily) with or without other B vitamins(folic acid and vitamin B12), compared to groups not consuming vitamin B6, the risk of hip fractureswas non-statistically signi ﬁcantly increased (during the trial period (median follow-up 3.3 years, hazard ratio (HR) 1.42 (95% CI 0.78, 2.61)) and signi ﬁcantly increased when considering also the extended follow-up period after the end of the trial period (median follow up 11.1 years; HR 1.42 (95% CI 1.09,1.83)) (Lopez et al., 2017). Similar ﬁndings were obtained in an analysis of data from the Nurses ’ Health Study (US), a prospective cohort study in 61,445 women.A signi ﬁcantly increased risk of hip fracture was observed among women with vitamin B6 intakes ≥35 mg/day compared with women with vitamin B6 intake <2 mg/day (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.29 (95% CI 1.03, 1.59), however there was a lack of dose –response relationship when only B6 supplement usage was tested (Meyer et al., 2019).
An analysis on data from the prospective Singapore Chinese Health Study in 63,257participants (Dai et al., 2013) showed a non-statistically signi ﬁcant increased risk of hip fractures between the fourth quartile of vitamin B6 intakes (0.78 –1.7 mg/1,000 kcal/day) and the ﬁrst quartile (0.36 –0.61 mg/1,000 kcal/day), i.e. adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.29 (95% CI 0.99, 1.68), although the vitamin B6 intakes in quartile four were still within the range of intake that can be achieved through the habitual diet.An analysis on 1,002 women of the Framingham Osteoporosis Study (McLean et al., 2008) found that the risk of hip fractures was non-signi ﬁcantly increased when individuals were vitamin B6 de ﬁcient (based on plasma PLP concentrations) compared with those who had an adequate vitamin B6 status.The relationship with high PLP concentrations was notinvestigated.
Finally, in a case –control study (Lumbers et al., 2001), the 75 women with hip fractures had signi ﬁcantly lower vitamin B6 intakes than the 50 controls (details on intakes not reported). 3.5.3.3.Impaired memorisation Molimard et al.(1980) described two intervention studies.One was in 69 medical students who received 0, 100 or 500 mg/day vitamin B6 for 10 days.The improvement in performance in a digitalcoding test between the test done at the beginning of the study and 15 days after the end was betterin the placebo group than in the 500 mg/day vitamin B6 group.There were no differences inimprovement of performance between the vitamin B6 groups and placebo when comparing the resultsat the end of the study with those at the beginning.There was no effect on tests that related to thesyllabus taught during the intervention and on two numerical application problems.
The other studywas a study in 30 obese patients on a low-calorie diet who received placebo, 20 or 1,000 mg/day vitamin B6 for 15 days. Even though the improvement in performance in the digital coding test was greater in the placebo group than in the vitamin B6 groups, differences were not statisticallysigni ﬁcant.The results in a word memorisation test, a visual memorisation test and a visual retention test were not different between groups.3.5.3.4.Anti-lactogenic effect An anti-lactogenic effect or inhibition of lactation by high intakes of vitamin B6 has been systematically reviewed (Al Saad et al., 2017).The total population in the seven human studies included in the review amounted to 1,155 post-partum women, of which 471 received vitamin B6.Three studies were RCTs, and four studies were non-randomised controlled trials.Daily doses of450–600 mg for 5 –7 days were consumed by the participants.
In two (out of the seven) included studies, lactation was suppressed in approximately 95% of the included participants followingconsumption of 600 mg/day for 6 days. In the remaining studies, no such effect was observed.A study in dogs also found that PN at different intake levels (10 mg/kg bw per day and 50 mg/kg bw per day for 20 days) could suppress lactation at the highest dose (da Silva et al., 2021).Tolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 41 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 3.5.3.5.Testicular toxicity In a systematic review, 12 studies were identi ﬁed, which related to the effect of vitamin B6 on semen quality (Banihani, 2017).Eight studies were conducted in animals, and four studies wereperformed in humans.Of the included human studies, one investigated monoamine oxidase in fertile and infertile men (Roberge et al., 1984) and one primarily considered other nutrients than vitamin B6 (folate andderivatives) (Forges et al., 2007).
One observational human study found seminal plasma PLP , folateand cobalamin concentration to be inversely correlated with ejaculation volume (Boxmeer et al., 2009),and another observational human study showed that a speci ﬁc dietary pattern consisting of high intakes of fruit, vegetables, ﬁsh and whole grains signi ﬁcantly correlated positively with blood PLP concentration, and inversely with sperm DNA damage (Vujkovic et al., 2009). The animal studies showed that high doses of vitamin B6 (125 –1,000 mg/kg bw per day) administered daily for 4 –9 weeks, led to lower weights of epididymis, testis, prostate gland and seminal vesicle, but also resulted in changes in testicular enzymatic activity.Further, adverse effects onspermatids, spermiation, Sertoli cells and sperm motility and count were also observed.3.5.3.6.
Conclusions on the evidence on high vitamin B6 intakes and on other adverse health effects The Panel notes that there is some evidence that vitamin B6 supplementation at a dose of 35–40 mg/day is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. However, the evidence to date is insuf ﬁcient to conclude on a causal relationship and a RP based on this observation cannot be used on its own.There is also an indication that vitamin B6 consumed at doses of 600 mg/day may suppresslactation, a level of intake that is beyond the RP originally used by the SCF (2000) to derive the UL.Evidence for a relationship of high vitamin B6 intakes with other outcomes discussed above isinsuf ﬁcient.3.6.Hazard characterisation 3.6.1.Selection of the critical effect and the reference point Experimental animal data show that vitamin B6 causes peripheral neuropathy in a dose related manner.
A similar relationship has been shown in humans, and peripheral neuropathy is the criticaleffect for setting the UL for vitamin B6. The SCF (2000) had identi ﬁed a RP of 100 mg/day based on peripheral neuropathy and mean vitamin B6 intakes in the human case –control study by Dalton and Dalton (1987).Using the same study but a different observation, the Panel identi ﬁed a lower RP than the SCF (2000), which is also supported by other available data.In the study by Dalton and Dalton (1987) neuropathy was reported in 48% of all women having taken vitamin B6 supplements <50 mg/day for at least 6 months (i.e.the lowest dose group).This percentage increased in a dose-dependent manner with higher vitamin B6 intakes.Based on the studyby Dalton and Dalton (1987) and supported by other case reports (Dalton, 1985; Dalton andDalton, 1987; Blackburn and Warren, 2017) and Member States ’vigilance data, a RP of 50 mg/day can be identi ﬁed.
Taking all evidence together, the available data indicate that symptoms may occur at daily vitamin B6 intakes of 50 mg and below with a large interindividual variability. The value of50 mg/day represents the lowest level of vitamin B6 intake that is associated with certainty with thedevelopment of neuropathy when consumed for more than 6 months, however smaller butuncon ﬁrmed B6 doses were also linked to this adverse effect.A LOAEL and a NOAEL cannot be identi ﬁed from human studies based on the available data.A subchronic study in Beagle dogs (Phillips et al., 1978) allows the establishment of a LOAEL of 50 mg/kg bw per day.All Beagle dogs (n = 5) consuming this dose for around 100 days showed bilateral loss of myelin in the dorsal sensory nerve roots, but no symptoms of neurotoxicity.The group ofﬁve dogs consuming 200 mg/kg bw per day, on the other hand, showed a pronounced damage to dorsal fasciculi and severe neurological impairments.No lesions were found in the control animals.
3.6.2. Derivation of the UL Default UFs in this Section are based on the default values recommended by the EFSA Scienti ﬁc Committee (2012).Default body weight are those recommended by the EFSA NDA Panel (2022).Tolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 42 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 3.6.2.1.Adults The Panel notes that since the assessment of the SCF (2000) no additional data became available to revise the UF of 4 originally proposed by the SCF (2000) in the derivation of the UL for vitamin B6.Therefore, the Panel proposes to apply a factor of 2 to account for the fact that there is an inverse relationship between dose and time to onset of symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.This factor covers the uncertainties as to whether the duration of exposure in the study by Dalton and Dalton (1987) wassufﬁciently long to cover this aspect.An additional UF of 2, as already used by the SCF , is proposed to be applied to account for the limited available data.
This covers the uncertainties as to the level ofintake that would represent a LOAEL and the uncertainties as to whether the study by Dalton andDalton (1987) was suf ﬁciently representative and large to account for interindividual variability and adequately covered sensitive groups of the population. It should also be noted that the RP to whichthe UFs are applied is based on supplemental vitamin B6 intake (not considering the background intake from the diet).Therefore, the Panel considers that the UF of 4 that is proposed to be applied is sufﬁciently conservative if the UL covers both dietary and supplemental vitamin B6 intake.Applying a UF of 4 to the RP of 50 mg/day identi ﬁed from the study by Dalton and Dalton (1987), and supported by other available data, results in a UL of 12.5 mg/day for adults.There is no indicationfrom the literature that men would be more susceptible than women.Therefore, the UL is consideredto be also protective for men.
When using the LOAEL of 50 mg/kg bw per day derived from the subchronic study in Beagle dogs (Phillips et al., 1978) as a basis and applying an UF of 300, a UL of 0.17 mg/kg bw per day is derived, corresponding to 11.7 mg/day using a default body weight of 70 kg for adults.
The UF of 300 is composed of the following: (a) a factor of 2 to account for interspecies variability in toxicokinetics; thedefault value of 4 that is suggested to be used for this purpose by the EFSA Scienti ﬁc Committee (2012) has been reduced by the Panel to 2, because of the similarities in vitamin B6excretion in terms of metabolites and total vitamin B6 between dogs and humans (Scudi et al., 1942),(b) a default factor of 2.5 for interspecies variability in toxicodynamics, (c) a default factor of 10 toaccount for intra-human variability in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics (default factors of 3.16 each),(d) a default factor of 2 to extrapolate from subchronic to chronic exposure, even though this default factor had been established for studies in rodents and (e) a factor of 3 which was considered suf ﬁcient by the Panel to account for the absence of a NOAEL.
The Panel notes that the derivation of the UL from the study in humans leads to a similar UL as when the study in dogs is used as a basis. This increases the con ﬁdence in the resulting UL.The Panel proposes to establish the UL at the midpoint of these two ULs and round down.Therefore, based on the evidence in both humans and dogs, the Panel derives an UL of 12 mg/day for adults.The UL includes dietary and supplemental intake and covers all vitamin B6 vitamers.3.6.2.2.Pregnant and lactating women There is no indication for a speci ﬁc risk or increased susceptibility to adverse effects of excessive vitamin B6 intake during pregnancy or lactation.A potential anti-lactogenic effect has been observedat intakes much higher than the UL (Section 3.5.3.4 ).In line with what was previously proposed by the SCF (2000), the Panel considers that the UL for adults also applies during pregnancy and lactation.3.6.2.3.
Children and adolescents There are no data to support a derivation of a UL for children. On the other hand, there is no indication from the literature that children may be more susceptible than adults to vitamin B6 toxicity.The Panel considers that it is appropriate to extrapolate the UL from adults to children based onallometric scaling (bw 0.75), as it is the preferred method to adjust for metabolic differences between age groups, using reference body weights (EFSA NDA Panel, 2022).ULs are established for the age categories proposed by the Panel in its guidance on establishing ULs (EFSA NDA Panel, 2022).Values are rounded to the closest 0.1 mg (Table 12).Tolerable upper level for vitamin B6 www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 43 EFSA Journal 2023;21(5):8006 3.6.2.4.Infants There are no data to support a derivation of an UL for infants.
On the other hand, there is no indication from the literature that infants may be more susceptible than adults to vitamin B6 toxicity.The Panel considers that it is appropriate to extrapolate the UL from adults to infants aged ≥4 months based on allometric scaling (bw 0.75), as it is the preferred method to adjust for metabolic differences between age groups, using reference body weights (EFSA NDA Panel, 2022). ULs are established for infants aged 4 –6 months and 7 –11 months, respectively.Values are rounded to the closest 0.1 mg (Table 13).3.7.Risk characterisation The ULs apply to the general European population and relate to vitamin B6 intake from all dietary sources and all vitamin B6 vitamers.Data on the intake of vitamin B6 from forti ﬁed foods and food supplements in European population are scarce (Section 3.4).
The Panel considers that it is unlikely that the UL for vitamin B6 is exceeded in European populations, except for regular users of food supplements containing high doses ofvitamin B6 (Section 3.4.3.2 ). Conclusions The following ULs are established: Age group UL males and females (mg/day) 4–6 months 2.2 7–11 months 2.5 1–3 years 3.2 4–6 years 4.5 7–10 years 6.1 11–14 years 8.6 15–17 years 10.7 Adults 12 Pregnant women 12 Lactating women 12 UL: tolerable upper intake level.Table 12: UL for children and adolescents aged 1 –17 years Age rangeReference bw males and females (kg)(a)UL males and females (mg/day) 1–3 years 11.9 3.2 4–6 years 19.0 4.5 7–10 years 28.7 6.1 11–14 years 44.6 8.6 15–17 years 60.3 10.7 Bw: body weight; UL: tolerable upper intake level.(a): The median weight for age at the mid-age of each age category used as reference weight.Sources: WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group (2006) for children aged 1 –3 years; van Buuren et al.

(2017) had consumed a large amount of energy drinkswith >2,000% the DRV for vitamin B6 and had PA concentrations of 463 lg/L (normal range 3–30lg/L, serum, plasma or whole blood not speci ﬁed); Falcone and Sowa (2013) did not specify the vitamin B6 intake of the ﬁve cases on which they reported; serum pyridoxine concentrations were 53.4 –148.5 ng/mL (216 –601 nmol/L) (normal range 2.1 –21.7 ng/mL); The case described by Malek et al. (2020) had consumed up to 30 mg/day vitamin B6 plus a number of energy drinks containing high amounts of vitamin B6; pyridoxine concentrationswere 60.2 ng/mL (244 nmol/L) (normal range 3.6 –18 ng/mL, serum, plasma or whole blood not speci ﬁed); Kaur et al.(2014) reported on a case who had PLP concentrations of 116 lg/L (469 nmol/L; normal range 5 –50lg/L) and PA concentrations of 37 lg/L (normal range 3 –30lg/L, serum, plasma or whole blood not speci ﬁed); Scott et al.
(2008) described 26 cases with neuropathy who had serum pyridoxine levels of 23.3 –177.3 ng/mL (94 –717 nmol/L; normal range 3 –30 ng/mL). Two patients have reported vitamin B6 intakes of around 50 mg/day for 34 years; Franzblau et al.(1996) reported on 125 randomly selected workers who self-reportedsymptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).Vitamin B6 status as measured by plasma PLPconcentrations and glutamic pyruvic transaminase assay was unrelated to CTS symptoms andelectrophysiologically determined median or ulnar nerve function; Keniston et al.(1997) in a cross-sectional study on 441 individuals reported that inmultivariable analysis taking vitamin B6 containing supplements (amount not reported) was positively associated with the prevalence of de ﬁnite CTS, but not with the prevalence of probable or con ﬁrmed CTS; Visser et al.(2014) studied 381 patients with chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy and 140 healthy controls.
Even though patients used more vitamin B6 containing supplements,plasma vitamin B6 concentrations (vitamer not speci ﬁed) were not signi ﬁcantly different between patients and controls. There was also no correlation between plasma vitamin B6concentrations and severity of polyneuropathy; Chaudary and Cornblath (2013) reported on 51 patients with neuropathy of unknown origin who all had elevated vitamin B6 concentrations in blood ( >26 ng/mL (range 31 –348 ng/mL, vitamer not reported).Vitamin B6 concentrations were uncorrelated with severity ofneuropathy.There was no improvement of symptoms following cessation of supplementation; Stewart et al.(2022) patients with chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy enrolled in thePeripheral Neuropathy Research Registry.There was no association between elevated plasmaPLP concentration ( >50 ng/mL) and self-reported severity of neuropathy or the results of nerve conduction studies.
