In AVED, the intestinal absorption of vitamin E is intact, but the circulating level in blood is very low. It typically presents from childhood to ado - lescence with a Friedreich ataxia (FA)-like phenotype charac - terized by ataxia, areflexia, and loss of proprioceptive and vi - bratory sensations.Head titubation is frequently associated with this disease, but dystonic head tremor as the predominant symp - tom is infrequently reported.1,3-5 We report a biochemically and genetically proven case of early adult-onset AVED presenting with predominant cervical and upper-limb dystonic tremor and sensory predominant ataxia.A 30-year-old female patient born to nonconsanguineous par - ents with an otherwise normal perinatal, developmental, and family history (Figure 1A) presented with tremulousness of the head and left upper limb for eight years and walking difficulty for six years.
Tremulousness of the head was decreased when ly - ing down; both yes-yes and no-no types of tremors were ob - served at different times; tremors were reduced when looking to the right; and abnormal posturing of the neck was reduced with a sensory trick (Supplementary Video 1 in the online-only Data Supplement). The patient had upper-limb tremors at rest and during activity, the latter of which were historically more severe and worsened when reaching for objects.Additionally, she also reported abnormal posturing of the right hand at rest and during activity.While walking, she swayed to either side, and the sway - ing was more common at night and when she closed her eyes.She denied any symptoms in the right upper limb, and there were no other relevant neurological or systemic symptoms.Informed consent was obtained for video recording and publication.The patient had normal cognition and cranial nerve exami - nation results, including visual acuity, fundus and eye move - ments.
The head tremors were predominantly of the no-no type with mild lateral tilt and lateral shift of the head when sitting comfortably with a null point (Supplementary Video 1 in the online-only Data Supplement). In addition, dystonia of the left hand along with pronation supination tremor of the left fore - arm could be observed both at rest and during posture and ac - tivity.Incoordination was observed in the left-side predominant finger nose test, and there was no significant dysdiadokokine - sia.The heel-shin test indicated bilateral impairment, which was better with visual cues.Head tremor was more apparent when walking, and truncal dystonia and mild right foot dysto - nia were observed.
Additionally, the patient exhibited general - ized hyporeflexia, reduced vibration sensation at the bilateral medial malleolus, impaired proprioception at the bilateral great toe, impaired tandem gait and a positive Rhomberg sign with otherwise normal tone, power and bilateral flexor plantar response. The rest of the examination results were normal.

AVED With Cervical Dystonia Holla VV, et al.www.e-jmd.org 221 Routine blood investigation results; vitamin B12, folate, homo - cysteine, ammonia, and lactate levels; and abnormal metabolites screening results were normal.
A sensory-motor nerve conduc - tion study (NCS) of all four limbs yielded normal results, whereas visual, brainstem auditory and somatosensory-evoked potential studies revealed prolonged latency in the lower limbs alone. Mag - netic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine screening was normal (Figure 1B-D).Head titubation, sensory predomi - nant ataxia and a normal cerebellum on MRI suggested the pos - sibility of an FA phenotype.GAA repeat test for FA were nega - tive, but the blood level of vitamin E was extremely low (178.081 ng/mL; normal: 5,500–18,000 ng/mL).Whole-exome sequenc - ing confirmed the diagnosis of AVED; a homozygous variant previously reported in ClinVar (SCV003204819.1), a pathogenic 1-bp duplication in the TTPA gene (chr8:g.63085963insG [GRCh38]; NM_000370.3:c.58dupC; p.His20ProfsTer56), was de - tected (Figure 1E).The patient was treated with 1,200 IU/day of vitamin E along with symptomatic therapy for dystonia with clonazepam and trihexyphenidyl.
At the 3-month follow-up, there was no further worsening or clinical improvement. AVED usually manifests around late childhood to early adoles - cence, but patients with onset from early childhood to the fourth decade have been reported.1 AVED presents clinically with an FA-like phenotype, and > 90% of patients have progressive atax - ia, hyporeflexia and/or impaired proprioception at the time of presentation; additionally, pyramidal signs and skeletal abnor - malities can occur.In contrast to FA, head tremor is a frequent occurrence in AVED, occurring in approximately one-third to two-thirds of patients at presentation,4 and patients with AVED have less severe neuropathy, less frequent cardiac involvement, and lower occurrence of kyphoscoliosis and diabetes than pa - tients with FA.Rarely, dystonia and myoclonus have also been reported in AVED.6 In most patients, head tremor is secondary to head titubation due to cerebellar involvement.
Becker et al.3 reported 2 patients with dystonic head tremor as the presenting symptom in a family with AVED. In addition, they reviewed the literature and identified 10 additional cases of AVED in which dystonia was noted.Pradeep et al.5 reported two out of three siblings from a family with AVED who had predominant dys - tonic head tremor at onset followed by the development of other features of AVED.Subsequently, there are two additional re - ports7,8 of dystonia in patients with AVED (Supplementary Table 1 in the online-only Data Supplement).
Among the cases report - ed to date, including ours, the common trend is that dystonia predominantly involves the neck in more than three-fourths of patients, followed by the upper limbs and lower limbs; dystonia eventually generalizes in approximately 50% of patients, and al - though it can be the first symptom, it is never isolated, as it is al - ways associated with other features of AVED, such as ataxia, hy - poreflexia and/or proprioceptive impairment. Neuronal oxidative injury due to vitamin E deficiency has been postulated to be the mechanism of neurological dysfunction in AVED.1,3 Animal models of AVED and tissue histopathology and postmortem studies in humans have demonstrated degen - erative changes in the substantia nigra, loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and dying back-type posterior column degener - ation, with or without involvement of nerve roots or the periph - eral nervous system.3 Ataxia in AVED is likely to occur through a Figure 1.

Electrophysiological studies dem - onstrate prolonged sensory conduction time for somatosenso - ry-evoked potentials; NCS often reveals sensory and/or motor axonal injury but can be normal in approximately 10% of cases.1,6 Early diagnosis is important so that high-dose vitamin E sup - plementation can be initiated early to halt disease progression and, in some cases, cause clinical improvement, especially in pa - tients with shorter disease duration.
Without treatment, patients with AVED can become wheelchair bound due to ataxia and/or leg weakness within 5–20 years, especially if the onset was ear - ly.1,3 Ataxia and intellectual deterioration can be reversed in symptomatic individuals if supplementation is started early in the disease course, whereas in older individuals, cessation of disease progression can be expected, although proprioception and gait abnormalities may persist.1 The response of dystonia to vitamin E supplementation is variable, with improvement in most patients, stabilization in a few patients and progressive dystonia despite supplementation in 1 patient.3 At the 3-month follow-up, the symptoms had stabilized in our patient. However, a longer follow-up is necessary to fully understand the effect of vitamin E supplementation.In conclusion, cervicobrachial dystonia with dystonic trem - or can be a predominant feature in patients with AVED.
This knowledge will aid in early diagnosis and prompt initiation of vitamin E supplementation.
