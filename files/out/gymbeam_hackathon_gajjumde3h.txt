There is still scarce information related to this topic. Aim:To evaluate the effect of the use of intra-dialytic RS-ONS vs .RS-ONS at home on sleep quality, nutritional status, and body composition in patients on HD.Methods: Adult patients <65 years, with ≥3 months on HD were invited to participate in an open randomized pilot study (ISRCTN 33897).Patients w ere randomized to a dialysis-speciﬁc high-protein supplement provided durin g the HD session (Intradialytic oral nutrition [ION]) or at home (control), during non-HD da ys (thrice weekly, for both) 12 weeks.The primary outcome was sleep quality deﬁned by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score.Nutritional assessment includ ed Malnutrition Inﬂammation Score (MIS), bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropom etry, 3-day food records, and routine blood chemistries.Results: A total of 23 patients completed the study.Age was median 35 ( range 24– 48 years), 42% were women.
At baseline, the PSQI score was med ian 4 (range 2–7), and MIS showed a median of 6 (range 5–8); there were no baselin e differences between groups. After intervention, both groups improved their MIS scores and similarly when we analyzed the whole cohort (pre- vs.post-intervention P<0.01).Patients in the ION group improved the overall PSQI score to median 3 (2–5), and a ssessment of sleep durationandsleepdisturbances(pre-vs.post-interventi onP<0.05),withatrendtoward an effect difference compared to patients consuming the sup plement at home (P for treatment-effect across arms 0.07 for PSQI score and 0.05 fo r sleep latency).González-Ortiz et al.Intradialytic Oral Supplementation and Sleep Quality Conclusion: Oral supplementation improved nutritional status in the wh ole cohort, but only ION improved the PSQI score.More studies are needed to explore the nutritional strategies that inﬂuence the relationship bet ween sleep and nutritional status in HD patients.
Keywords: intradialytic oral supplementation, sleep quali ty, hemodialysis, nutrition, anabolic INTRODUCTION Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD) frequently experience loss of appetite and poor sleep quality, conditions that are closely interrelate d. It has been reported that having a good nutritional status and good sleep quality are essential to maintaining quality of li fe.Previous studies have reported that around 30–80% of patients withadvancedCKDhadsleepdisorders,withahigherprevalen ce and severity in HD patients ( 1–3).Furthermore, poor sleep qualityhasbeenassociatedwithseveralhealthconsequenc essuch asmetabolicabnormalities,disability,pain,restlesslegs yndrome, fatigue,sleepapnea,depression,andmalnutrition( 4).
Adecreasednutrientandproteinintakeduetolossofappetite, a hypercatabolic state, metabolic acidosis, comorbidities , and dialysis itself may all contribute to malnutrition and inﬂammation also known as protein-energy wasting (PEW) ( 5), identiﬁed as a common problem in patients with CKD, with a current prevalence of 24–54% ( 6). Treatment of PEW with nutritional strategies such as nutritional support have prove n eﬀective and has been associated with adequate tolerance to th e supplement and better compliance to the HD treatment ( 7–9).Interventional and observational studies suggest that nut ritional supplementation may have the following beneﬁts: improved quality of life ( 9), increased body weight and maintenance of lean body mass ( 10), improved response to erythropoietin ( 11), improved serum albumin or prealbumin levels ( 9,12) better nutritional status (subjective global assessment) ( 13), increased energyandproteinintake( 14)andlowermortality( 15).
Nutritional guidelines establish the need of nutritional supplementation in order to maintain a minimum energy intake of 25–35 kcal/kg/body weight/day, for those patients with chronically inadequate intake and whose protein and energy requirements cannot be attained by dietary counseling; the y suggestaminimumofa3-monthoforalnutritionalsupplements (16).Theuseoforalsupplementationisconsideredatherapeutic alternative that can provide 7–10 kcal/kg/day and 0.3–0.4 g/kg/day of protein intake, which helps to meet recommended goals and also may supply a great variety of macro and micro nutrients, as well as covering the skipped meal time, during th e daythepatientattendsaHDsession( 17). PEWimpactsnegativelyonCKDpatientoutcomes,including quality of life, rate of hospitalizations, presence and sever ity of infections, cardiovascular events, survival ( 5,7,8), and sleep quality(9).IthasbeendemonstratedthatPEWcanbetreated via oral supplementation ( 16).
It has been known that HD therapy has been associated with net protein loss from the whole body, however, this catabolic process can be reversed by oral nutri tionduring HD session ( 18). In addition, the anabolic eﬀects of intradialytic oral nutrition (ION) seem not to be limited to the administration period like parenteral nutrition ( 18).However, despite the evidence, there is no clear indication of the best time to use oral supplementation ( 16).The use of a nutritional supplement would allow, in the ﬁrst instance, to cover both energyandproteinintakeinthispopulationand,inturn,reduc e protein catabolism caused by dialysis treatment, so that its use during the HD session may be even more eﬀective ( 18).
On the otherhand,sleepdisturbancesareincreasinglybeingstud iedand associated with the intake of both macro and micro nutrients , mainlyinthegeneralpopulation,wherehoursofsleephavebeen associatedwithdiﬀerentnutritionaloutcomes( 19).Hemodialysis patients often have frequent sleep disturbances, as well as poor appetite,malnutrition,andbodycomposition( 20,21).

Eligible participants were adults (>18 years), both sexes, under maintenance HD (at least 3 months on therapy), thrice weekly, and Kt/V >1.2 or URR >65%. Patients with (1) amputation of any extremity, (2) planned renal transplant within the next 3 months, (3) acute kidney injury, hospitalization 1 month prior to the initiatio n of the study, and (4) those who had ultraﬁltration volumes of more than 3 liters per session or with sleep disorders (diagnosed by sleep clinic experts) were excluded.All patients were informed about the nature of the study and signed an informed consent.Simple randomization to one of two groups was performed by an external collaborator without contact wi th theresearchteaminchargeofenrollmentandinterventionusi ng awebsite(randomizer.org).Dietary Assessment All patients were given personalized nutritional counseling , according to current guidelines ( 22,23).

MIS, Malnutrition I nﬂammation Score.*Pre- vs.post-intervention p <0.05.**At 50kHz.Medical history represents the sum of score: change in dry weight, dietar y intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, functional capacity and co-morbidity.Physical exam represents the sum of score: decreased fat stores or los s of subcutaneous fat and signs of muscle wasting.Laboratory parameters represents the sum of score: albumin and total iron binding capacity.Study Outcomes Sleep Quality The assessment of sleep pattern and quality was performed by a sleep specialist before a HD session with the Pittsburgh Sle ep Quality Scale (PSQI), which is a self-report tool of 19 items regarding sleep quality and degree of diﬃculty sleeping duri ng the last month.
It is made up of 7 components: sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep eﬃciency, sleep distu rbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction. The 7 components are added to produce an overall score with a range from 0 to 12; higher scores indicate poorer sleep quality.An overall score >5 has a diagnostic sensitivity of between 89.6 and 98.7%,andspeciﬁcityof84.4–86.5%,diﬀerentiatingbetweenba d andgoodsleepers( 25,26).
Nutritional Status TheMalnutrition InﬂammationScore (MIS) calculationmetho d includes (A) medical history: Changes in dry weight after dialysis(3–6months),dietaryintake,gastrointestinals ymptoms, functional capacity, and comorbidity according to time on HD .(B) Physical exam, loss of fat stores or subcutaneous fat bel ow eyes, triceps, biceps, chest, and signs of loss of lean mass in temple,clavicle,scapula,ribs,quadriceps,knee,interosseou s,(C) body mass index (BMI), and (D) biochemical parameters such as serum albumin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) or transferrin, which are estimated from the results of the var ious evaluations. Each of them is classiﬁed into four degrees of severity.Starting from 0 to 3 on the scale, the sum of all 10 MIS components can range from 0 (normal) to 30 (severely malnourished)—a higher score reﬂects a more severe degree o f malnutritionandinﬂammation( 27).
Body Composition The participants were evaluated at the end of the HD session at the following time points: at baseline, and at the end of the follow-up—we included body weight and height to determine BMI. For the measurement of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIE), two “emitting electrodes and two sensor electrodes” were carefully placed (standard, tetrapolar placement on the hand and foot).Measurements were conducted by the same Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 882367 González-Ortiz et al.Intradialytic Oral Supplementation and Sleep Quality TABLE 3 | Changes ( /Delta1) in sleep quality characteristics, nutritional status, an d body composition in both study groups.

Sample Size Since there are no previous studies that have evaluated the eﬀect of ION supplementation on sleep quality, we analyzed the entirepopulationofourHDunit,andsubsequentlyperformeda statisticalpoweranalysis.Powerofthesamplesizewascalcul ated using GPower19R⃝(version 3.1.9.4; Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf, Germany). A statistical power calculation was m ade with the included sample size in which the eﬀect size was 0.50, giving a total power of 0.608 with two tails considering the wholecohort.Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were performed, and continuous varia bles were presented as arithmetic means and standard deviation fo r those that had a normal distribution, and those that did not werepresentedasmediansortheinter-quartilerange.Wecar ried out analysis following protocol, and to determine whether ther e werestatisticaldiﬀerencesbetweenthegroups,thechi-square test was performed for the qualitative variables.
For the quantita tive, the Mann Whitney U tests or the Student’s t-test was employed, dependingontheirdistribution.Wilcoxonorpaired T-testswere used to determine the diﬀerences between the basal and ﬁnal groups,accordingtothedistributionofthedata. A subanalysis was performed by group and in all the patients asonegroup.TheanalyseswereperformedusingSTATA(version15.1;Stata Corp, College Station, TX) and p≤0.05 was established for statisticalsigniﬁcance.RESULTS A total of 26 participants were randomized, of which 23 ﬁnished the study; in general, 94% adherence to treatment was observe d.Thedescriptionofpatientselectionandmonitoringareexplai ned in detail in Figure2.This was a relatively young population with almost half of them with diabetes mellitus.Regarding biochemical measurements, a median of 3.6 (range 3.2–3.7) g /dl of serum albumin was observed, while iron proﬁles were in normal ranges.
There were no diﬀerences at baseline in dietar y energy and protein intake between groups ( Table1), nor in the Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 6 July 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 882367 González-Ortiz et al. Intradialytic Oral Supplementation and Sleep Quality FIGURE 3 | Change in Pittsburgh score after 12 weeks of oral supplement ation.(A)At home group and (B)ION group.whole cohort comparing baseline and ﬁnal measurements (data notshown).Sleep Quality The basal median of the total sample on PSQI was 4 (range 2–7) points.Sleepinesswaspresentin8%ofthesampleatbaselineand 14patients(46%)werepoorsleepers(PSQI >5).Subsequently, after 12 weeks of follow-up, the Pittsburgh components were analyzed between groups, and a signiﬁcant decrease diﬀerence was found in the sleep latency, as well as i n the presence of sleep disturbances ( p<0.05 for both groups).
The ION group showed improvement in the sleep duration and disturbances as well as a decreased prescription of sleep medications. The total score improved in the ION group (pre- vs.post-intervention, p<0.05), whereas no diﬀerences were found in the home group (pre- vs.post-intervention) ( Table2).When we explored the diﬀerence in sleep changes between groups we found a statistical diﬀerence only in sleep latency i n the ION group, with a trend toward improvement in the sleep disturbancesandoverallPSQIscores( Table3).When we evaluated the Pittsburgh score individually for each patient, we observed a trend to improve mainly in those of the ION group ( Figure3B ), while the group that received supplementation at home, the score seemed to worsen by the end of the intervention ( Figure3A ).
Considering a decrease of two points in the PSQI an improvement, seven participants (58%) improved in the ION group; the number needed to treat indicated that we must treat eight [CI 95% (6.9–8.6)] patient s withIONtodecreasetwopointsinthePSQI. Nutritional Status and Body Composition Afterrandomization,nodiﬀerenceswerefoundbetweengroups .At the end of the study, we found an improvement in MIS score in both groups, pre- vs.post-intervention ( p<0.05), but no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed betwe en the groups.In the ION group, BMI showed improvement; however, inthehomegroup,theBMIdecreasedandnPNAimprovedafter intervention,whilenootherdiﬀerenceswereobserved( Table2).No diﬀerences were observed between groups in other nutritionstatus markers.
Finally, considering it as an improvement of nutritional status, a decrease of two points was observed in t he MIS score; almost all participants improved- −10 participants (83%) in the ION group and 8 participants (73%) in the home group. The number needed to treat indicated that we must treat 10patientswithIONtodecreasetwopointsinMIS4.When we analyzed the whole cohort as one group, we found a decrease in unsaturated iron-binding capacity, no ot her diﬀerences in biochemical measurements.According to PSQI components,wefoundanimprovementinsleepdurationandin thetotalscore,whenweclassiﬁedpoorvsgoodsleepersatthee nd of the study only 3 participants were poor sleepers, and the time to sleep increased, and according to MIS, only BMI not shown diﬀerencesattheendofthestudy( Table4).
DISCUSSION Informationregardingtheuseoforalsupplementsandtheeﬀect on sleep in HD patients is scarce, however, there is a large bod y of evidence that associates dietary intake with sleep quali ty in the general population, where the main outcomes are focused on nutritional status. This study suggests that intradialy tic oral nutrition may improve sleep quality and both interventions ( at home and nutrition supplementation during HD sessions) were eﬀectiveinimprovingnutritionalstatus.When we analyzed sleep results, an eﬀect was found only in the group that received ION.
There is evidence linking the nutritional status assessed by the MIS score and sleep qualit y, where those patients who had the worst sleep quality were also thosewhohadtheworstnutritionalstatus( 29).Therefore,itwas expected that those who would improve their nutritional status afterreportedusinganutritionalsupplementwouldalsoimprove their sleep quality; however, it was observed that through th is intervention,onlytheIONgroupshowedimprovement. There are other studies that associate nutritional status with sleep quality in this population.Burrowes et al.( 30) found a decreased appetite as sleep quality worsened.In this study, after ION improved patients’ sleep quality, Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 882367 González-Ortiz et al.Intradialytic Oral Supplementation and Sleep Quality TABLE 4 | Effects of ION on sleep quality index components, nutritiona l status, and body composition.

In a recent review, it was described that meal time and sleephygienearetwoofthemostimportantaspectstoinvestig atein the link between diet and sleep ( 19). And in hemodialysis patients has been studied also how the patients use to skip meal ondialysisday( 20).The presence of sleep disturbances is highly prevalent in this population and dialysis modality or age can be important factors (31,32).Both, the presence of sleepiness and poor sleep quality have been associated with worse quality of life of the se type of patients ( 33) as this is a persistent problem; however, in this study, the presence of sleepiness was observed only in two individuals, so it is not possible to know if the improvement Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 882367 González-Ortiz et al.Intradialytic Oral Supplementation and Sleep Quality in the nutritional status had any eﬀect in this parameter (data notshown).
When we evaluated sleep quality characteristics, the group receiving ION presented improvement, mainly in terms of sleep durationandsleepdisturbancesaswellasinareductionofu seof sleep medications ( p<0.05 intra-group eﬀect). Similarly, there wasaneﬀectonthetotalPSQIscoreintheIONgroup.Noeﬀects were found between supplementation at home and sleep quality norwhenexploringthediﬀerencebetweenthegroups.But,when weanalyzedthewholecohorttheresultsshownanimprovement in sleep duration, sleep hours, fewer poor sleepers, and lower PSQItotalscore.It is important to mention that this ﬁnding not only supports the use of an oral nutritional supplement in HD patients for nutritional improvement, but could also imply an improvement in sleep quality, if administered during the HD session.Whe n we analyzed the results individually, we observed that a lar ge proportionofparticipantsintheIONgrouppresentedadecrease in the PSQI score, while the patients in the home group seemed to have a worse score.
Although ION seems to have an eﬀect on sleep quality in this study, it is clearly necessary to con sider conducting clinical trials with a larger sample size. Neverth eless, thisisoneofthefewstudiesthatexploretherelationshipbe tween IONandqualityofsleep.There are multiple proven beneﬁts regarding the use of ION in HD patients; it has been shown to have persistent anabolic beneﬁts for muscle protein metabolism in the post- HD phase, while the anabolic beneﬁts of parenteral nutrition during HD sessions dissipated during the same period.These data support both the anabolic and anti-catabolic functions o f ION (18).However, in this study, we observed that the use of a nutritional supplement is eﬀective in both groups—patients who consume it during the HD session and those who had the supplementation at home.
This was evidenced through the results obtained by the MIS score that improved signiﬁcantly i n both groups ( p<0.05, without statistical diﬀerences between the groups), and this is consistent when we analyzed the whole cohort, were we found improvements in all the components an exception of BMI, which was already normal at the beginning of the study. One explanation for these positive results could be adherence to treatment, which was higher than 90% in all thepopulation.There is a large body of evidence that states that oral supplementation decreases hospital admission rates, serum IL-6 levels ( 34), improves hypoalbuminemia ( 35), physical functionality ( 36), PEW (37), better body composition markers (38), quality of life ( 39), and reduces mortality ( 40).However, the evidence of ION compared with nutrition at home is scarce, although this strategy has already been shown to be s afe and eﬀective, as recently demonstrated by Ramos-Acevedo et al.(41).
On the other hand, BMI has been reported to be a nutritional status factor that can be maintained regardless of the supplement used during dialysis, as recently reported in a 6-month follow-up clinical trial, comparing consumption of a normal meal vs. a hyper-protein meal intra-dialysis; bothgroups maintained BMI but not for albumin, where the results were better for the group that received the hyper-protein meal(38).Martin-Alemañy et al.demonstrated the combined eﬀect of oral supplementation plus aerobic or resistance exercise on nutritional status, and physical functionality ( 42).Ocepek et al.found that in malnourished patients who had previously received oral supplementation but were not presently receiving them, serum albumin and hand-grip strength tended to worsen , and even for those who were well-nourished, the nutritional markers decreased ( 43), indicating, as expected, that the eﬀect is not permanent.
So, it should be done constantly, including the entire population as a part of a daily practice in HDpatients. A major limitation of our study is our small sample size and its low mean age, which may not reﬂect the usual on dialysis in mostcountries;however,thisistheﬁrsttrialthatassocia tessleep quality with the use of oral supplementation.The use of oral supplementation improves nutritional status but it is necessar y to perform more RCTs with larger sample sizes to explore the mechanisms that inﬂuence the relationship between ION and sleep quality, and is necessary to implement strategies to hel p complianceforalongtime.A clinical application of this paper is that oral supplementation has been studied in diﬀerent outcomes, however,studiesaboutsleepoutcomesaremissing.In Conclusion, the results of this pilot study support the implementation of oral supplementation, as a strategy to improve nutritional outcomes and that could have an eﬀect on sleepquality.
