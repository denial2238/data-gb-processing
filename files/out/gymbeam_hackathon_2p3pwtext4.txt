1068 Maternal, Perinatal and Pediatric Nutrition Determining Ideal Balance Among Branched-Chain Amino Acids(BCAA)asaProofofConceptStudyinHealthyChildren Haneen Saleemani,1Rajavel Elango,1Gabriella Horvath,2and Sylvia Stockler2 1Universityof BritishColumbia;and3BCChildren’sHospital Objectives: Medical foods for children with in-born errors of metabolism (propionic academia, PROP) are formulated with imbal- ancedmixtureoftheBCAA(highleucine,tominimalornovalineand isoleucine),andthereforetheiruseiscontroversial.Theobjectiveofthe currentstudywastodetermineanidealBCAAratioatwhichtotalbody protein synthesis is optimized in healthy children using the indicator aminoacido xida tio n(I AA O)method.Methods: Thestudydesignwasbasedontheoxidationofthestable isotopeL-[1–13C]phenylalanineto13CO2tocompareproteinsynthesis among seven different BCAA ratios.
Leucine intake was gradually reducedfromcurrenthighdosesinmedicalfoods;isoleucineandvaline werekeptconstant.Thisstudywasdoneasaproofofconceptinhealthy children, to allow characterization of the metabolic responses to wide range of leucine test intakes, to help design narrow BCAA ratio range totestinchildrenwithPROP.Results:A total of 8 healthy children were studied, completing 42 study days. ANOVA showed significant differences in F13CO2 with different BCAA ratios; P value <0.001.A BCAA ratio of (leucine: Isoleucine: Valine =1:0:0) was associated with the highest F13CO2 c o m p a r e dt oo t h e rr a t i o s( pv a l u e <0.001), indicating low total body proteinsynthesis.Byreducingleucineintake,withBCAAratiobetween (1:0.26:0.28to1:0.35:0.4)proteinsynthesiswasoptimized.Conclusions: Using the IAAO method in healthy children, we tested for the first time the effect of different BCAA ratios on protein synthesis.
Results from this study confirmed that the BCAA ratio of (leucine: Isoleucine: Valine =1:0:0), which is similar to the ratio in medical foods, limited total body protein synthesis. Furthermore, a balanced BCAA ratio that optimized protein synthesis was found to be between (1: 0.26: 0.28) and (1: 0.35:0.4).Thus, we propose reformulatingtheBCAAmixtureinmedicalfoods,byreducingleucine content by 50%.Future research in children with PROP with our proposedBCAAratioisnecessarytoconfirmimprovedpatientgrowth outcomes.FundingSources: FacultyofAppliedMedicalSciences,Department of Clinical Nutrition, King Abdulaziz University and BC Children’s Hospital Research Institute.CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NUTRITION
