Under optimal conditions, semiquantitative analysis results were visible by eye,with a visual limit of detection of 8 μg/kg for CBX and CYA, and cut-o ﬀvalues of 20 μg/kg for CBX and 40 μg/kg for CYA in chicken breast. Quantitative analysis could be performed using a hand-held strip scanner, with a calculated limit of detection of2.92 μg/kg for CBX and 2.68 μg/kg for CYA in chicken breast.Validated by liquid chromatography −MS/MS, the developed GICA provides a useful tool for rapid on-site CBX and CYA residue screening in chicken breast.■INTRODUCTION Carbadox (CBX) and cyadox (CYA) belong to the class of compounds known as quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides, which arewidely used as antibacterial growth-promoting agents in animal feed.Because CBX has mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic properties, many countries have forbidden its use in foodanimals.
1CYA is a novel species of quinoxaline and is considered to be safer than CBX, and thus, has replaced other quinoxalines in some countries.2However some studies recently reported that CBX might have potential mutagenicity and liver toxicities at certain doses.3Thus, it is necessary to establish a screening method for CBX and CYA residues for animal-origin food. Several instrument methods have been established for detection of CBX and CYA, such as high-performance liquidchromatography with ultraviolet (UV) detection4,5and high- performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrome- try (HPLC −MS/MS).6−8Because of its high accuracy and sensitivity, HPLC −MS/MS is used as the standard method for actual sample detection.However, such methods usually need complex sample pretreatment, expensive instruments, long detection times, and professional technicians.These disadvan-tages restrict their application for the rapid screening of large numbers of samples.
Compared with these instrumental methods, immunoassay methods have advantages of simple sample preparation, lowcost, time-saving, and convenient operation. For this reason, immunoassays, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 9,10colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA),11−18and ﬂuorescence immunoassays,19−21havebeen widely applied in food safety on-site detection.Recently, some research studies about immunoassays for the rapiddetection of quinoxalines had been established.22−29As shown inTable 1 , ic-ELSA and immunochromatographic assays have been developed to simultaneously detect ﬁve quinoxalines: CBX, CYA, olaquindox (OLA), quniocetone (QCT), andmequindox (MEQ).30However, no immunoassays have been reported for simultaneous detection of CBX and CYA inanimal tissues.In this work, we ﬁrst designed a novel hapten for CBX and CYA monoclonal antibody (mAb) preparation.
Based on thisantibody and the visualization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs), astrip sensor was fabricated for rapid detection of CBX andCYA residues in chicken breast. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Hapten Design.CBX (MW = 262.23) and CYA (MW = 271.24) are both of low-molecular weight and have noimmunogenicity.Thus, they need to be coupled to a carrierprotein to induce an immune response by the mouse.However, CBX and CYA have no active groups ( Figure 1 a), such as −NH 2or−COOH that can react directly with a carrier protein.In order to prepare a mAb which can identify CBXand CYA simultaneously, we kept the shared structuralelement of CBX and CYA, ( E)-2-(hydrazonomethyl)- quinoxaline 1,4-dioxide, as the hapten ( Figure 1 b).
Besides, the−NH 2of the hapten can conjugate with a carrier protein Received: September 9, 2019 Accepted: October 11, 2019 Published: January 13, 2020Article Cite This: ACS Omega 2020, 5, 1422 −1429 © 2020 American Chemical Society 1422 DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.9b02931 ACS Omega 2020, 5, 1422 −1429 This is an open access article published under an ACS AuthorChoice License, which permits copying and redistribution of the article or any adaptations for non-commercial purposes. using the GA method.GA is a common protein coupling method and can introduce a ﬁve carbon chain as the spacer arm that is bene ﬁcial to exposure of the antigenic determinant.This results in conditions that are favorable for the mouse ’s immune system to produce antibodies against CBX and CYA.The LC −MS/MS spectrum ( Figure 2 a,b) revealed a molecular ion at m/z205.1 [M + 1]+at a retention time of 2.287 min, which supported a molecular formula of C 9H8N4O2(MW 204.19).
The structure of the hapten in this work was alsofurther con ﬁrmed by1H NMR spectrometry (400 MHz, DMSO- d6)(Figure 2 c):δ8.40−8.54 (m, 5H), 8.18 (s, 1H), 7.86−7.93 (m, 2H). Antigen Characterization.Antigens, including hapten − ovalbumin (OVA), hapten −BSA, and hapten −keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), were characterized by UV spectroscopy.As shown in Figure 3 , the characteristic UV absorption peaks of hapten and carrier proteins were at 378 and 280 nm.Theantigens simultaneously had the absorption peak of hapten atTable 1.Immunoassays for Quinoxaline 1,4-Dioxide Detection methods target analytes LOD matrix references immunochromatographic assay QCA 25 ng/g pig tissues Le et al.201222 ic-ELISA and time-resolved ﬂuoroimmunoassayQCA porcine muscle and liver Le et al.201526 immunochromatographic strip CBX, MEQ, OLA, QCT, and CYA 10, 15, 15, 20 and 20 ng/mL animal feeds Le et al.201530 immunochromatographic assay MQCA 0.25 ng/mL ﬁsh Liu et al.

The pH value, ionic strength, and organicsolvent content of assay bu ﬀer have an e ﬀect on protein conﬁguration, which will in ﬂuence the conjugation of the antibody and antigen. 31,32Besides, di ﬀerent analytes have diﬀerent dissolved conditions; for example, dibutyl phthalate could be su ﬃciently dissolved at a certain concentration of organic solvent; tetracycline could undergo hydrolysis underacidic and basic conditions, and remain stable under neutralconditions.In this work, NaCl content ranging from 0.4 to6.4% was tested to assess the e ﬀect of ionic strength.As shown inFigure 4 a, the absorbance value decreased signi ﬁcantly along with the increasing NaCl content.The maximum absorbancevalue ( A max) was less than 1.0 when the NaCl content was greater than or equal to 3.2%.The biggest Amax/IC50value was obtained when the NaCl content was 0.4% in assay bu ﬀer.Themethanol content and pH value of assay bu ﬀer have few e ﬀects onAmaxvalues.
The biggest Amax/IC 50value was obtained when the methanol content was 10% and the pH value was at 7.4(Figure 4 b,c). Thus, assay bu ﬀer with 0.4% NaCl content, 10% methanol content, and pH 7.4 was used to establish the standard curve.Under these optimum conditions, the IC 50 values of CBX and CYA were 1.84 and 1.85 ng/mL ( Figure 4d), respectively.Identi ﬁcation of the mAb subtype bene ﬁts the selection of the mAb puri ﬁcation method.33Figure 4 e shows that the mAb against CBX and CYA was subtype IgG2a, which can bepuriﬁed using the salting out method (caprylic acid −saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation method), protein A, or proteinG method.34We used the protein G method for ascites puriﬁcation to obtain the mAb.In general, a large Kaffvalue indicates high mAb a ﬃnity.A high a ﬃnity antibody, with a Kaffvalue between 107and 1012 L/mol, can limit the consumption of antibody and antigen in immunoassay development.
Through ﬁtting the curve in Figure 4f, [Ab] tvalues of 2.14 ×109, 4.94 ×109, and 2.50 ×109mol/ L were obtained at the corresponding coating concentrationsof 1, 0.3, and 0.1 μg/mL, respectively. Substituting into the calculating formula, the K affvalue of our mAb was 3.19 ×109 L/mol.In addition to establishment of the GICA, this antibody was also applied in immunoa ﬃnity column development for the pretreatment of positive samples containing CBX orCYA.35 The cross-reactivity of our mAb is shown in Table 2 .A s shown, it has little cross-reactivity with QCA, with an IC50 value of 25.5 ng/mL and cross-reactivity (CR) of 7.3%.However, it shows no cross-reactivity with other quinolones(CR < 1.0%), including OLA, MEQ, QCT, and MQCA.Thisindicated that the methyl group had a signi ﬁcant in ﬂuence on antibody generation in the mouse.GICA Principle and Establishment.The schematic diagram showing the GICA principle is shown in Figure 5 .
The GNP-labeled mAb was ﬁrst conjugated with target analytes (CBX or CYA) to form the GNP-labeled-mAb − Figure 3. UV spectrogram of hapten −KLH, hapten −BSA, and hapten −OVA.Figure 4.Characterization of mAb.Optimization of assay bu ﬀer for ic-ELISA, (a) NaCl content, (b) methanol content, (c) di ﬀerent pH; (d) standard curve for CBX and CYA with ic-ELISA; (e) subtypes determination; (f) a ﬃnity detection.ACS Omega Article DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.9b02931 ACS Omega 2020, 5, 1422 −14291424 CBX (or CYA) complex.The complex ﬂowed with the standard or sample solution from the sample pad to theabsorption pad due to the capillary action of the absorptionpad.When the solution reached the T zone on the nitrocellulose (NC) membrane, the unconjugated GNP- labeled mAb conjugated with the hapten −OVA on the T line.When it reached the C zone, the GNP-labeled mAbalways conjugated with the goat antimouse IgG antibody onthe C line.
If the sample was negative, the GNP-labeled mAbconjugated with the hapten −OVA and generated a red line in the T zone. If the sample was weakly positive, some of theGNP-labeled mAb could also react with the hapten −OVA on the T line and produce a light red line in the T zone.If thesample was positive, all of the GNP-labeled mAb conjugatedwith the CBX (or CYA), and no extra GNP-labeled mAb couldconjugate with the hapten −OVA sprayed on the T line.Therefore, the T zone was colorless.Meanwhile, the C zonewould always appear as a red line because of the conjugationbetween the GNP-labeled mAb and the goat antimouse IgGantibody.If the C line was colorless, this indicated that thestrip was invalid.The coating antigen on the T line and the amount of the mAb used for GNP labeling was optimized.
As shown in Figure 6a,b, when the coating antigen was hapten −OVA and the amount of mAb was 8 μg/mL GNP solution, the T line color was relatively lighter at a CBX concentration of 5.0 ng/mL,which showed that the inhibition to CBX was relatively better. The sample resuspension solution plays an important role in actual sample analysis.Three surfactant species (Tween-20,ON-870, and Triton-100) at 3% in 0.01 M pH 7.4 phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS) were optimized.From Figure 6 c, it can be seen that the GNPs clumped on the sample pad, whichresulted in the T line and C line color being really light.Compared with PBS, the addition of the surfactant increasedtheﬂow of sample solution on the strip.However, it also caused visible GNP aggregation on the sample pad when thesurfactant was Tween-20 or ON-870.Consequently, 0.01 MPBS pH 7.4 with 3% Triton was chosen as the chicken breastsample resuspension solution for analysis of CBX and CYA inthis work.
Under the above optimal conditions, a series of forti ﬁed samples (0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 10, 20, and 40 μg/kg) were tested to establish the GICA method for detection of CBX and CYAresidues in chicken breast. As shown in Figure 7 a,c, the cut-o ﬀ values when the T line became colorless were 20 μg/kg for CBX and 40 μg/kg for CYA.The lowest concentrations when the T line color become too light to see with the naked eye,deﬁned as the visual limit of detection (LOD), were 8 μg/kg for both CBX and CYA.These results can be used forsemiquantitative analysis of unknown samples.If the CBX (orCYA) content of a sample was equal to or greater than 20 μg/ kg (or 40 μg/kg), it was considered a positive sample.If the CBX (or CYA) content was between 8 and 20 μg/kg (or 40 μg/kg), it was a weakly positive sample, while if the CBX (or CYA) content was below than 8 μg/kg, the sample was negative.For quantitative analysis, results were evaluated using a hand-held strip scanner.
The standard curves established withthe chicken matrix are shown in Figure 7 b,d. Twenty blank chicken breast samples were tested, and the correspondingTable 2.Cross-Activity of mAb Figure 5.Schematic diagram of strip for GICA.(a) Planar view of the strip; (b) Schematic illustration in negative, weakly positive, and positive sample.Figure 6.Optimization for GICA.(a) Coating antigen on the T line; (b) mAb amount for GNP labeling; (c) sample suspension solution.ACS Omega Article DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.9b02931 ACS Omega 2020, 5, 1422 −14291425 CBX and CYA concentrations were calculated using the matrix standard curve.The average plus three times the standarddeviation was de ﬁned as the calculated LOD (cLOD).According to this calculation, the cLOD was 2.92 μg/kg for CBX and 2.68 μg/kg for CYA.Therefore, the proposed GICA and hand-held strip scanner could be applied to screening ofCBX or CYA residues in chicken samples on site.Validation of GICA with LC −MS/MS.
To evaluate the accuracy, recovery tests were performed. Samples were spikedwith CBX (or CYA) at concentrations of 4, 8, or 12 μg/kg.From Table 3 , we can see that the recovery rate ranged from 89.5 ±8.9 to 109.6 ±10.3% for CBX and CYA analysis, with coeﬃcients of variation (CVs) ranging from 9.0 to 14.6% in chicken breast.The LC −MS/MS results further con ﬁrmed the proposed GICA, with recovery rates ranging from 93.9 ±8.9 to 114.4 ±8.5%, and CVs ranging from 6.8 to 9.9%.These results further con ﬁrmed the feasibility of the proposed GICA method.■CONCLUSIONS In this work, we designed a new hapten for production of a mAb against CBX and CYA.Based on this antibody, a GICA was established for semiquantitative and quantitative screening of CBX and CYA residues in chicken breast samples.The detection process could be completed within 15 min.Recovery tests validated the accuracy, and the LC −MS/MS method further validated the results.
In conclusion, the developed GICA method could be applied for rapid detection of CBX and CYA residues in chicken breast samples in the ﬁeld. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials and Reagents.Standards, including CBX, CYA, OLA, QCT, and MEQ, were purchased from J&K Scienti ﬁc Ltd.(Beijing, China).The carrier proteins KLH and OVA were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St.Louis, MO, USA).Coupling agent (25% glutaraldehyde solution, m/v), immuno- logic adjuvants, including Freund ’s complete adjuvant (FCA) and Freund ’s incomplete adjuvant (FICA) were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.The horseradish peroxidase (HRP)- labeled goat antimouse immunoglobulin was obtained from Kangcheng Bioengineering Co.(Shanghai, China).The reagents used for cell fusion, including polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW 1450), RPMI-1640 medium, fetal bovine serum, and hypoxanthine −aminopterin −thymidine (HAT) and hypo- xanthine −thymidine supplements were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc Inc.(Shanghai, China).

The residue was puri ﬁed on a silica column to give the hapten (300 mg) as a yellow solid with a yield of 55.9%. The structure of the hapten was characterized by1H NMR spectrometry and LC −MS/MS analysis.Antigen Preparation.The antigen was synthesized using the glutaraldehyde method.36In detail, 20 mg hapten was dissolved in 2 mL dimethylformamide and then 600 μLo f glutaraldehyde, diluted ten times using PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4), was added dropwise.Thirty minutes later, the activated solution was divided into three equal volumes and each wasadded drop by drop into a carrier protein solution (KLH, BSAor OVA, 5 mg/mL in 0.1 M carbonate bu ﬀer solution pH 9.6).After 2 h of stirring the reaction at room temperature, theconjugates were dialyzed six times against 0.01 M PBS (pH7.4).Then, hapten −KLH, hapten −BSA, and hapten −OVA were obtained and characterized using an UV −visible spectrophotometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Thehapten −KLH was used as the immunogen, with hapten −BSA and hapten −OVA used as the coating antigens. Immunization Schedule.Female BALB/c mice (6 −8 weeks old) were immunized to produce antibodies againstCBX and CYA.37Before immunization, the immunogen was emulsi ﬁed with isometric FCA or FICA.Each mouse was then injected subcutaneously with 100 μg hapten −KLH emulsi ﬁed with FCA for the ﬁrst immunization.Every twenty one days, the mouse was given a booster injection of 50 μg hapten −KLH emulsi ﬁed with FICA.After four immunizations, the serum of each mouse was assessed using ic-ELISA.The detailed ic-ELISA procedure has been described in our previouspublication.38The mouse with the highest titer and the highest inhibition with CBX and CYA was sacri ﬁced for cell fusion.Three days before cell fusion, this mouse was injectedintraperitoneally with 25 μgh a p t e n −KLH without any immunologic adjuvant.Cell Fusion and Hybridoma Screening.
As described in our previous reports,38,39spleen cells and sp 2/0 cells were fused at a ratio of 1:5 −10 using the PEG method. Through HAT medium culture screening, the hybridoma cells would survive culture under 37 °C, 5% CO2.The cell supernatants were further screened using ic-ELISA.The wells with thehighest titer and highest inhibition with CBX and CYA weresubcloned using the limiting dilution method.After threerounds of subcloning and screening of cell supernatants, asingle cell mass was picked out and cultured at an extendedscale.Then, this cell line was frozen and stored in liquidnitrogen.Ascites Preparation and Puri ﬁcation.Before being inoculated intraperitoneally with hybridoma cells, BALB/cmice were injected with sterilized paroline (1 mL/mouse).After seven to ten days, ascites were collected using aninjection syringe and then centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm.The AKTA pure protein puri ﬁcation system (GE Healthcare Little Chalfont, UK) was used to obtain pure mAb.
Theconcentration of mAb was tested using a NanoDrop One(Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA). mAb Characterization.The mAb characterization in- dicators included sensitivity (half inhibition concentration,IC 50), antibody subtype, a ﬃnity ( Kaff), and CR %.ic-ELISA Assay Optimization and Sensitivity.The ic-ELISA assay bu ﬀer was optimized by testing various sodium chloride concentrations (0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4% by mass fraction),diﬀerent pH values (4.7, 6.0, 7.4, 8.8, and 9.6), and methanol concentrations in PBS (0, 10, 20, 30, and 40% by volumefraction).The IC 50at each condition was obtained using the standard curve generated using a series of CBX solutions (0,0.14, 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, and 100 ng/mL).The ratio ofabsorption values of blank control ( A max) and IC 50value (Amax/IC50) was used to evaluate the ic-ELISA performance.Antibody Subtype.
The antibody subtype was determined using a mAb isotyping ELISA kit.18The di ﬀerent HRP-labeled secondary antibodies included IgA, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3,and IgM. Aﬃnity.As described in our previous publications, the antibody was diluted from the 1 μg/mL stock to form a gradient of 8-fold serial dilutions.The coating antigen(hapten −OVA) concentrations were 1, 0.3, and 0.1 μg/mL.The mAb a ﬃnity was tested by ic-ELISA.By ﬁtting the antibody concentration to the absorption values, the antibodyconcentration when the absorbance is half of the initial value([Ab] t) can be calculated.The a ﬃnity constant ( Kaff) was calculated using the following equation, where nis the multiple of two corresponding antigen concentrations37 =− [′ ] − []Kn n1 2( Ab Ab )aff tt Cross-Reactivity.Other quinoxalines, including CYA, OLA, MEQ, QCT, MQCA, and QCA, were used to evaluate the cross-reactivity of the mAb.Similarly, the IC 50values of each quinoxaline were determined.
The CR % could be obtainedfrom the following equation, as described in previous reports40 = CR % (IC value of CBX)/(IC value of each structural analogue)50 50 Gold Immunochromatographic Assay. Preparation of GNPs.GNPs with a diameter of 25 nm were synthesized using the citrate reduction method14,41Brieﬂy, 100 mL of chloroauric acid solution (HAuCl 4·4H2O, 0.01%, w/v) was boiled under continuous stirring; then, 2.0 mL fresh trisodiumcitrate solution (1%, w/v) was added quickly into the boiledsolution.Five minutes after the color changed to wine red, thesolution was cooled to room temperature while stirring.Thesolution was then stored at 4 °C for further use.Preparation of GNP-Labeled mAb.First, the mAb was diluted to 0.2 mg/mL using 0.2 M borate bu ﬀer solution (pH 8.8); then, 40 μL of 0.1 M potassium carbonate solution was added into 10 mL of the GNP solution.Next, 400 μL mAb was added to the GNP solution, and the mixture was allowed tostand for 45 min at room temperature.
Finally, 500 μL BSA solution (10%, w/v) was added to the mixture and incubatedfor 2 h at room temperature. Then, the solution wascentrifuged at 8000 rpm, 4 °C for 45 min.The supernatant was then removed, and the sediment was resuspended in 1 mL0.01 M PBS solution with 0.02% sucrose.Strip Fabrication.The strip for the GICA was made up of four parts, comprising the sample pad, NC membrane,absorption pad, and PVC backing sheet.42The hapten −OVA and goat antimouse IgG were sprayed onto the T zone and the C zone of the NC membrane, respectively.The NC membranewas placed in the middle of the PVC backing sheet, while thesample pad and absorption pad were glued at either end of thePVC sheet with a 2 mm overlap.After drying at 37 °C for 24 h, the fabricated card was cut into strips with a width of 3.85 mm.The strips were stored in a dry environment for further use.ACS Omega Article DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.9b02931 ACS Omega 2020, 5, 1422 −14291427 GICA Procedure.
To perform the test, 150 μL of standard (CBX or CYA) or sample solution was mixed with 50 μL GNP-labeled mAb in a microplate well. The mixture wasincubated for 3 min at room temperature.The strip was thendipped into this well, so that the solution ﬂowed from the sample pad to the absorption pad due to capillary action.After5 min, the results could be visualized by the naked eye.Forquantitative analysis, the strip was tested using a hand-heldstrip scanner, which could give the T/C value (the ratio ofcolor intensity between the T line and the C line) directlywithin 30 s.The standard curve was established by ﬁtting a series of CBX or CYA standard concentration ( Xaxis) against T/C values ( Yaxis) using the logistic function.Analysis of Spiked Chicken Breast Using the Strip Test.Chicken breast samples were purchased from a local supermarket and were proven to be CBX and CYA-free by LC−MS/MS analysis.
A series of spiked CBX or CYA chicken breasts were examined using the developed GICA method.Each sample was pretreated as follows: 5.0 g of minced chickenbreast was weighted into a 50 mL centrifuge tube; then, 20 mLof acetonitrile was added, and the tube was vibrated for 3 min.Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min, afterwhich 4 mL of the supernatant was removed and dried usingpressured blowing concentrators at 45 °C. The residue was dissolved in 4.0 mL PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4) containing 3%Triton-100 solution, and 80 μL was used for GICA analysis.The chicken substrate standard curves were established forCBX and CYA quantitative analysis.Recovery Test.Fortiﬁed CBX or CYA chicken breast samples at three concentrations (4, 8, and 12 μg/kg) were used to evaluate the proposed GICA protocol.To validate theGICA results, these spiked samples were tested using LC − MS/MS analysis at the same time.■AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Authors *E-mail: wuxiaoling_8@163.com (X.W.).
