Neuroscience/Nutrition and the Brain 1195 Effects of Four-Week Supplementation of Ashwagandha and B-VitaminsonMoodandStressRelief Sheau Ching Chai, Irene Li, Carly Pacanowski, and Benjamin Brewer UniversityofDelaware Objectives: Currently,about77%ofAmericansregularlyexperience physical and emotional symptoms caused by stress.The present study examined the combined effects of ashwagandha and B-vitamins on moodandstressrelief.Methods: In a pre- and post-intervention trial, forty women, 30–50 years of age, with a body mass index between 25 and 35 kg/m,2 were assigned to consume a taffy containing ashwagandha and B- vitaminstwicedailyforfourweeks.Self-reportedmood,sleepduration, and levels of stress hormones were assessed over the course of four weeks.Paired t-tests were used to compare variables across all possible pairs of time points, and linear mixed models featuring random intercepts were employed to investigate linear changes over time in the same set of variables.
Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to establishthestrengthoftherelationshipbetweenselectedvariables.The statisticalsignificancelevelwassetat0.05.Results:Perceived levels of stress, state anxiety, and traits anxiety scores were significantly reduced by 19.6% ( P<0.001), 14.3% (P=0.03), and 12.2% ( P=0.01), respectively at four weeks compared with baseline.

Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that daily sup- plementation of ashwagandha and B-vitamins could be a plausible intervention for improved mood and stress levels in women.
