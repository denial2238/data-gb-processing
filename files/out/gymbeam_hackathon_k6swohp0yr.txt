Benefits are likely from vitamin B-6 in premenstrual syndrome Little commercial or scientific interest has been shown in the use of vitamin B-6 as a treatment forpremenstrual syndrome, and only limited conclusionson efficacy can be drawn from published studies.Thegovernment has recently highlighted unproved effi-cacy and complications from use of vitamin B-6 at highdosages as a rationale for reducing access to thisvitamin.On p 1375 the meta-analysis by Wyatt et alhighlights the poor quality of existing studies andshows the need for high quality large trials to make adefinitive statement on the use of vitamin B-6 for thetreatment of premenstrual syndrome.Surgical experience should not be defined by workload On p 1381 Kee et al investigate the influence of hospi- tal and surgeon workload on survival with colorectalcancer in Northern Ireland, using a province-widecolorectal cancer register.
The authors determined theoutcome of all cases ascertained and managedsurgically between 1990 and 1994, with a medianfollow up of 54 months. Surgeon caseload had no sig-nificant effect on mortality after Dukes’s stage wasadjusted for.There was, however, a significant impacton survival from the overall hospital workload, withcases treated in hospitals with a low workload ( < 33cases per year) having slightly better survival at 2 yearsthan those treated in hospitals with a higher workload.No evidence was found for a linear trend.The authorsconclude that any definition of an expert on the basisof workload is rather fragile, and the lack of routinelycollected case mix data presents major challenges forclinical audit and governance in the future.Copying referral letters to patients has no effect on non-attendance Interventions intended to reduce non-attendance at hospital outpatients have previously been hospitalbased.
T o test if a primary care based interventionwould be effective Hamilton et al (p 1392) assessed theeffect of sending a copy of the referral letter from thegeneral practitioner to the patient in a randomisedcontrolled trial. The concept of sharing letters with thepatient was accepted by participating general practi-tioners and patients, but there was no change innon-attendance rates.Short planned hospital stays are more effective for patients withmental illness Although around 80% of resources for mental health are spent on hospital provision, there is little evidence ofeffectiveness on how best to organise and deliver thiscare.
This was one of the main conclusions found byJohnstone and Zolese (p 1387) from a systematic reviewof planned short hospital stays versus standard care.Despite this, the review suggests that patients whoreceived planned short stays (between 1 and 4 weeks)with intensive coordinated care had outcomes that wereas good as the standard care (no more readmissions, nomore losses to follow up, and greater chances of beingemployed). The authors identified gaps in quantitativeand qualitative research for this important policy.Many patients with hepatic encephalopathy are ondamaging diets Despite current recommendations, many UK hospitals are still treating patients with cirrhosis and hepaticencephalopathy with protein restricted diets.A surveyof dietetic departments by Soulsby and Morgan(p 1391) provided details of the dietary managementof 1046 patients and showed that 73% had theirprotein intake restricted to some degree.
Twenty fiveper cent of patients had been referred with a request torestrict protein intake. In many cases these patientsfound it difficult to maintain oral intake but less than25% received additional nutritional support.Treatments for shoulder complaints do not show longterm effects In 1994-5 Winter et al showed in a randomised controlled trial of treating shoulder complaints in gen-eral practice that at 11 weeks steroid injections werebetter than manipulation or physiotherapy for“synovial” complaints while manipulation was betterthan physiotherapy for shoulder girdle complaints.Onp 1395 they reassess these results after examining thepatients two to three years after the original study.Theyfound no differences in the numbers with currentcomplaints or complaining of not feeling curedbetween any of the treatment groups for eithersynovial or shoulder girdle complaints.This week in the BMJ BMJ VOLUME 318 22 MAY 1999 www.bmj.com
