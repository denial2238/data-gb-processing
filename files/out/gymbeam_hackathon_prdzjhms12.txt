A clinical study by MURTHY A.R., Lecturer, Dept .of Dravyaguna, NIA, Jaipur 302 002, Rajasthan *DUBEY S.D., Reader & Head, Dept.of Dravyaguna, IMS BHU, Varanasi-5, Uttar Pradesh **TRIPATHI K., Prof.& Head.Of Medicine, IMS BHU, Varanasi-5, Uttar Pradesh Received: 16.2.2000 Accepted: 16.3.2000 INTRODUCTION The clinical entity of Hypertension is not available as such in th e classical literature of Ayurveda.However, according to the directions of charaka ( C.Su 18/44-47) regarding the approach for the study of new diseases, various co ntemporary Ayurvedic scholars have been made efforts to find out the proper nomenclature, etiopathogenesis and treatment of the disease.Even though an ideal Ayurvedic treatmen t yet to be explored on the scientific parameters.
Therefore, it is high time to ponder over the problem on a comparative basis of modern and ancient thoughts in order to sear ch out it’s rational therapy for eradication of the menace of human beings. On the basis of above mentioned background we have made an effort to study the efficacy of indigenous plant diuretics in the treatment of Hypertension.For this purpose we have selected the most popular, easily available and safe plant i.e Gokshura (Tribulus terrestris Linn ) belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae, on the basis of extensive review of all available ancient and modern literature regarding it’s diuretic action.The experimental and clinical studies reported till now by various workers (Chopra RN, 1939, Gujerat ML, 1955, Karandikar GK, 1960, Singh RCP, 1971 and singh RG 1991) also st rengthen the diuretic action of the drug.MATERIAL AND METHODS About 75 patients of either sex, different age groups having non-complicated, mild to moderate (140-179 mmHg.Systolic and 90-109 mmHg.
Diastolic) essential hypertension with the symptoms of headache, giddiness, insomnia etc. were selected for the present study form the outpatient department s of Dravyaguna and Medicine of S.S Hospital , Institute of Medical sciences, Banaras Hindu University, varanasi.The pregnant women and hypertensives who are associated with other diseases were excluded form the study .all the patients were randomly divided into three groups (A,B&C) having 25 in each.Clinical evaluation was made on the basis of proper history, physical examination and laboratory investigations of the individuals according to the clinical proforma of the study.All the patients were advised to take their routine diets but extra ghee, eggs, salt, etc were restricted.
The test drug i.e whole plant and fruits of Gokshura ( Tribulus terrestris Linn ) in the form of ghanasatwa (solid water extract) as administered orally to the Group A&B respectively, at the dose of 3 gm/day in three divided doses in a soft gelatin capsule and Group C was treated as control in which pages 139 - 145 2lactose IP was given with same dos, intervals etc, of the test drug. The duration of treatment was four weeks and the follow up of the patients was made at the end of every week for the assessment of improvement in general condition of the patients, parameters of the study and any side effects of the drug .PARAMETERS The results were observed on the basis of subjective and objective parameters before and after the therapy.
The subjective parameters includes headache, giddiness, insomnia, swelling and other related symptoms of Hypertension and objective parameters includes systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, pulse rats, 24 hours urinary volume and serum cholesterol. The various data obtained from the it was analysed and tested for statistical significance.OBSERVATION AND RESULTS Table-1- showing Number of patients having di fferent symptoms in various groups before and after one month of therapy.Group A Group B Group C Symptom BT AT BT AT BT AT Headache 19 05 18 07 19 18 Giddiness 24 12 20 11 18 16 Insomnia 18 07 13 06 10 09 Palpitation 19 06 23 09 13 12 Swelling 22 07 20 30 14 11 In the present study majority number of patients were came with the symptoms of headache (56), giddiness (62), insomnia(41), Palpitation (55) and swelling (56).
After one month of therapy the significant improvement in clinical symptoms was observed in both the drug treated groups A&B than the control Group C, in which there was considerable change was observed (Table-1).

This observations reflects the ultimate hypotensive property of t test drug (Tables 6&7) Group A Group B Group C Mean diff 11.81 11.01 1.04 S.E ±3.12 ±2.89 ±0.15 T 3.61 3.80 - p <0.01 <0.02 NS pages 139 - 145 5Table-8 Sowing mean difference increase of 24 hour Urinary Volume (ml) after one month of Therapy The maximum mean difference increase of 24 hours urinary volume was observed in group B (210.45) than Group A (201.61, while comparing with the control Group (12.25) both the Groups A and B were showed statistically significant effect (Table-8) Table-9- Showing mean Difference Decrease of Pulse Rate (per minute) after one month of Therapy Wile considering the mean difference decrease of pulse rate the maximum effect was observed in Group B (9.23) than the Group A (8.82). However, in comparison to control (NS) both the drug treated groups are statistically significant (Table-9).
Table-10- Showing mean Difference changes of serum cholesterol (mg%) after one month of Therapy The decrease of serum cholesterol was also observed in both the drug treated groups, Which were statistically significant in comparison to control group. However, the effect was more pronounced in Group A (10.23;<0.01) (Table-10).
DISCUSSION The results of both s ubjective and objective parameters of the study reveals that both the whole plant and fruits of Gokshura (Tribulus terrestris Linn) in the form of ghanasatwa is having a significant acti on in reduction of clinical symptoms, systolic and diastolic blood pressure without any side effects on Group A Group B Group C Mean diff 201.61 210.45 12.25 S.E ±14.98 ±13.25 ±2.73 T 13.45 15.88 - p <0.02 <0.01 NS Group A Group B Group C Mean diff 8.82 9.23 1.30 S.E ±2.23 ±2.57 ±0.41 T 3.45 3.59 - p <0.01 <0.01 NS Group A Group B Group C Mean diff 10.23 9.49 2.14 S.E ±2.97 ±2.86 ±0.76 T 3.44 3.32 - p <0.02 <0.01 NS pages 139 - 145 6the patients of mild to moderate essential hypertension. While considering clinical symptoms the maximum improvement of headache and giddiness in Group A and palpitation and swelling in Group B was observed.
In case of objective parameters the maximum improvement in systolic, diastolic blood pressure and serum cholesterol in group A and 24 hours urinary volume and pulse rate in Group B was also observed. However, there was n significant variations in the overa ll results of Groups A and B.In Ayurveda, the descriptions regarding the properties and actions of Gokshura are generally depicted for the whole plant and it is also clear the various parts of a particular pl ant may have different panchamahabhautic configuration, constituents, properties and actions.Hypertension is a disease of raktashrita and tridoshaja is a prime f actor for production of the disease.The components of drug therapy f hypertension includes tridosha shamana, agni dipana, ama pachana, lekhana, rakta & sroto shodhana, hridya, mutrala, rasayana and mastishka shamaka or medhya rasayana.
Gokshura (Tribulus terrestris Linn) is having the properties of best diuretic and vatahara (C.Su 25/40), by virtue of these properties Gokshura may antagonize the etipathogenesis of hypertension by reducing the intra vascular volume, thus prevents further accumulation of fluid and ultimately influence the other blood pressure controlling mechanisms like renal, cardiac, endocrine and central nervous system. It may removes all the excretory fluids by normalizing their proper flow within the body due to its vatanulomaka property.Apart form these the other properties of the drug like agnidipana (APN), srotoshodhana (RN), rasayana (C.S.Ci.II, 1/26), hridya, vasodilator (Wang B, 1990) anti-cholesteremic (Arcasoy, 1998) adoptogenic and improves psycho-emotional imbalances (shaw BP, 1994) which may also help in the same.CONCLUSION Overall the Gokshura (T ribulus terrestris Linn.) is having a significant anti-hypertensive effect both systolic and diastolic without any side effects.
Therefore this plant diuretic can be safely recommended for a longer period to the patients of mild to moderate hypertension mainly associated with fluid retention, of course it’s role in severe hypertension may be as an adjuvant to the main therapy. However, further stud ies are suggestive to know the proper mechanism of action on large number of patients and other scientific parameters.REFERENCES: 1.Arcasoy HB et al., Effect of Tribulus terre stris on some smooth muscle preparations: a preliminary study, Boll chim farm 1998 Dec; 137 (11):473-5 2.Ashtanga Hridaya with Hindi commentary of Atridev Gupta, Chowkha mbha Sanskrit series, varanasi 1988.3.Bhavaprakash Nighantu with Hindi comm entary by Chunekar KC., Chaukhambha Vidyalaya, Varanasi 4t Edn 1969.pages 139 - 145 74.Charaka samhita, Sanskrit text with English translation by RK Sharma & Bhagwan Das, Chowkhambha Sanskrit series office, varanasi 1988.5.Chopra RN, Indigenous drugs inqui ry (I.D.Q), A review of the work of T.
