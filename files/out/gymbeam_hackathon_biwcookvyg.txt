Whether orally ingested exogenous ketones can stimulate postprandial myo ﬁbrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) rates with and without dietary protein co-ingestion is unknown. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ketone monoester intake and elevated blood β-hydroxybutyrate ( β-OHB) concentration, with and without dietary protein co-ingestion, on postprandial MyoPS rates and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway signaling.Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, parallel group design, 36 recreationally active healthy young males (age: 24.2 /C64.1 y; body fat: 20.9% /C65.8%; body mass index: 23.4 /C62 kg/m2) received a primed continuous infusion of L-[ ring-2H5]-phenylalanine and ingested one of the following: 1) the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KET), 2) 10 g whey protein (PRO), or 3) the combination of both (KET þPRO).
Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected during basal and postprandial (300 min) conditions to assess β-OHB, glucose, insulin, and amino acid concentrations, MyoPS rates, and mTORC1 pathway signaling.Results: Capillary blood β-OHB concentration increased similarly during postprandial conditions in KET and KET þPRO, with both being greater than PRO from 30 to 180 min (treatment /C2time interaction: P<0.001). Postprandial plasma leucine and essential amino acid (EAA) incremental area under the curve (iAUC) over 300 min was greater (treatment: both P<0.001) in KET þPRO compared with PRO and KET.KET, PRO, and KET þPRO stimulated postprandial MyoPS rates (0 –300 min) higher than basal conditions [absolute change: 0.020%/h; (95% CI: 0.013, 0.027%/h), 0.014%/h (95% CI: 0.009, 0.019%/h), 0.019%/h (95% CI: 0.014, 0.024%/h), respectively (time: P<0.001)], with no difference between treatments (treatment: P¼ 0.383) or treatment /C2time interaction (interaction: P¼0.245).
mTORC1 pathway signaling responses did not differ between treatments (all P>0.05). Conclusions: Acute oral intake of a ketone monoester, 10 g whey protein, or their co-ingestion in the overnight postabsorptive state elicit a similar stimulation of postprandial MyoPS rates in healthy young males.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04565444 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04565444 ).Keywords : ketone bodies, young males, myo ﬁbrillar protein synthesis, β-hydroxybutyrate, whey protein, exogenous ketosis, skeletal muscle, amino acids Introduction Ketone bodies [ie, β-hydroxybutyrate ( β-OHB), acetoacetate, and acetone] are naturally occurring lipid-derived molecules whoseendogenous production is ampli ﬁed in the liver through ketogenesis inresponse to low energy availability (ie, prolonged fasting, and starva- tion), very low carbohydrate intake (ie, a ketogenic diet), and pro-longed glycogen depleting exercise [ 1].
Under these conditions, ketone bodies serve as a metabolic fuel source in extrahepatic tissues, such asthe brain, heart, and skeletal muscles [ 1].

Therefore, exogenous ketone supplements permit direct testing of the metabolic effects ofelevated blood ketone body concentration without the confoundinginﬂuence of widespread changes that occur in response to prolonged fasting/starvation or ketogenic diets. The role of ketone bodies in the regulation of whole-body and muscle protein metabolism has been a topic of interest for decades.Earlystudies in humans reported that intravenous infusion of ketone bodiesreduced urinary nitrogen excretion by >30% during prolonged fasting [5,6], suggesting that ketone bodies may have protein sparing effects.In skeletal muscle, intravenous infusion of sodium DL- β-OHB has been reported to stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates in both dogs[7] and humans [ 8].More recently, Vandoorne et al.
[ 9] reported that oral intake of an exogenous ketone monoester supplement co-ingested with aprotein-carbohydrate –containing beverage enhanced the phosphoryla- tion status of select proteins within the mechanistic target of rapamycincomplex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway in human skeletal muscle afterexercise [ 9]. In the same study [ 9], addition of ketone bodies to a low dose of leucine (1.5 mM) stimulated a ~2-fold increase in protein syn-thesis in C 2C12cells, which was similar to that achieved with a high-dose of leucine (5.0 mM).Altogether, these data suggest that orally ingested exogenous ketone supplements may promote protein synthesis in muscle, potentially through activation of the mTORC1 signalingpathway.However, the effects of orally ingested exogenous ketonesupplements, with and without dietary protein co-ingestion, on bothmyoﬁbrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) rates and mTORC1 pathway signaling have not been evaluated.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of elevated blood β-OHB through oral ingestion of the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydrox- ybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate when consumed without protein (KET)and when co-ingested with 10 g whey protein (KET þPRO), on post- prandial MyoPS rates and compare with those of protein ingestion (PRO). In addition, we examined the phosphorylation status of select signaling proteins within the mTORC1 pathway known to be involvedin the regulation of MyoPS rates.Given the established dose –response relationship between protein/essential amino acid (EAA) ingestion andpostprandial MPS rates, whereby ingestion of 20 g high-quality protein[10,11] or 10 g EAA [ 12] maximally stimulates postprandial MPS rates in young males, we hypothesized that PRO would stimulate MyoPSrates higher than basal conditions (ie, overnight postabsorptive con-ditions).
We further hypothesized that KET would stimulate MyoPSrates higher than basal conditions; however, KET þPRO would stim- ulate greater MyoPS rates than both KET and PRO alone due to ketone bodies amplifying the anabolic effect of a suboptimal 10 g dose of protein. Methods Participants and ethical approval Thirty-six healthy recreationally active young males (age: 24.2 /C6 4.1 y) were recruited to participate in this randomized, double-blind,parallel group study.Healthy was characterized as a body mass index>18.5 and <30 kg/m 2and moderately active based on responses to aroutine screening questionnaire.Participants with an exercise fre- quency between 3 and 4 times per week were considered recreationallyactive and were included in the study.
Participants with any identi ﬁed metabolic or intestinal disorders, self-reported use of tobacco products,allergies to milk proteins, lactose intolerance, phenylketonuria, a his-tory of neuromuscular problems, previous participation in a stable- isotope tracer study, adherence to a strict vegan or vegetarian diet, current use of ketone supplements or adherence to a ketogenic diet, useof medications known to affect protein metabolism, diagnosis of dia-betes, and participation in sports or physical exercise for /C215 d per week were excluded from the study. Participants were recruited throughadvertisements on dedicated bulletin boards within McGill Universityand posts on social media from 14 September 2020 to 26 April 2021.The intervention/treatment experimental test days were conductedbetween 21 September 2020, and 14 May 2021.All participants wereinformed about the purpose of the study, the experimental procedures,and potential risks before providing informed written consent.
The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Faculty of Medicine Institutional Review Board at McGill Universityon human experimentation and in accordance with the tenets of theHelsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in October 2013. The studywas approved by the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences Insti-tutional Review Board at McGill University on 6 January, 2020 (IRBStudy Number: A11-M51-19A) and was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04565444).Preliminary testing, diet, and physical activity Participants underwent an initial laboratory screening visit to assess height, weight, blood pressure, and body composition (through dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; GE Healthcare).All participants were provided with food intake and physical activity logs that they were asked to complete during the 2 d immediately before their experimentaltrial visit.
During this time, study participants were asked to refrainfrom strenuous physical activity and alcohol consumption. This wasveriﬁed verbally with the participant on the morning of their experi- mental trial and con ﬁrmed by checking their food intake and physical activity logs.Dietary intake from the food logs was analyzed usingcommercially available software (Food Processor version 11.9; ESHAResearch).All participants were provided with a standardized meal(Michelina ’s Beef and Macaroni; Bellisio Foods), which provided 2134 kJ of energy and consisted of 52% energy from carbohydrates, 31% fat, and 17% protein.Participants were instructed to store the meal in their freezer and consume it for dinner during the evening before theirexperimental trial visit.The participants were instructed to stopconsuming food or beverages (except water) by 21:00, after which theywere instructed to fast until testing the following morning.
Experimental design This study used a randomized, double-blind, parallel group design in which participants reported to the laboratory for a single test visit(not including the preliminary testing visit). Participants wererandomly assigned to 1 of the 3 nutritional beverage treatment groups(n¼12 participants per group).The randomization procedure to allocate treatment group was executed using a random-number generator ( www.randomization.com ).An investigator not directly afﬁliated with the study was responsible for the randomization.Beverage speci ﬁcations are outlined further .To limit diurnal and intrasubject variation, all measures were performed according to astandardized time schedule at the same time of day.S.J.Hannaian et al.The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 119 (2024) 716 –729 717 Nutritional treatments An investigator not directly af ﬁliated with the study was responsible for the preparation of the treatment beverages on the morning of the experimental visit.
Treatments were matched for volume and prepared in opaque plastic bottles. KET and KET þPRO treatment groups ingested the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydrox-ybutyrate (DeltaG; TDeltaS; under license by HVMN) at a dose of 0.36g/kg/body weight per serving.Previous studies have shown a single0.36g/kg/body weight dose of (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydrox-ybutyrate to be safe, tolerable, and effective in eliciting acute hyper-ketonemia in humans (ie, raising plasma β-OHB to ~3 mM) [ 3,4].Participants in PRO and KET þPRO groups consumed protein bever- ages containing 10 g of whey protein concentrate (Isagenix).Theprotein-containing beverages were enriched to 4% with L-[ ring- 2- H5]-phenylalanine, based on a phenylalanine content of 3.14% in the whey protein, to minimize disturbance in the plasma precursor poolenrichments [ 13].
To better match the energy content of the nutritional treatments, carbohydrate was added to the KET and PRO treatments.This consisted of a combination of Glacier Cherry Gatorade (G2Gatorade Company), dextrose powder (NOW foods), stevia (SteviaSelect), and vanilla ﬂavoring (McCormick & Company). The stevia and vanilla ﬂavoring were added to the nutritional treatments to better match taste.After consumption, the bottle containing the nutritionaltreatment was rinsed with 40 mL of water to dislodge any remainingremnants and ensure that all content in the bottle was consumed.The participants had 5 min to ingest the nutritional treatment assigned to them.Treatment speci ﬁcations are outlined in Table 1 .Experimental protocol A schematic overview of the experimental protocol is shown in Figure 1 .Study participants reported to the laboratory at ~07:30 in the ~10-h overnight postabsorptive state.
On arrival, participants restedcomfortably on a bed in the laboratory while health status andcompliance of the pre-experimental visit guidelines were con ﬁrmed. A Polytetra ﬂuoroethylene catheter was inserted into an antecubital vein for baseline blood sample collection ( t¼/C0 180 min) and for the infusion of L-[ ring- 2H5]-phenylalanine.The stable-isotope tracer L- [ring-2H5]-phenylalanine (ACP Chemicals) was dissolved in 0.9% saline for intravenous infusion.The tracer solution was prepared at apharmacy (Gent /C18es & Bolduc, Pharmaciens) and subsequently tested for sterility.After the administration of a priming dose (2.2 μmol/kg) of the L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine tracer, a calibrated syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) was used to continuously infuse the tracer during the entireexperimental trial (8 h, 0.05 μmol/kg/min).
A second Polytetra ﬂuoro- ethylene catheter was inserted into the dorsal hand vein or antecubitalvein of the contralateral arm for heated (60/C14C) arterialized venous blood sampling. A saline drip was connected to the stopcock to keep the catheter patent for repeated blood sampling.Another arterialized venous blood sample was drawn at t¼/C060 min.Before the nutritional treatment, a muscle biopsy was collected along with another arterial-ized venous blood sample ( t¼0 min) to determine basal (ie, overnight postabsorptive) MyoPS rates and mTORC1-related signaling moleculephosphorylation status.
Immediately after the skeletal muscle biopsyand arterialized venous blood sample at t¼0 min, a capillary blood sample was obtained through ﬁnger lancet to measure basal β-OHBTABLE 1 Amino acid, ketone monoester, carbohydrate, fat, and protein content of thenutritional treatments Nutritional treatment group KET PRO KET þPRO Amino acid content Alanine (g) — 0.49 0.49 Arginine (g) — 0.25 0.25 Aspartic acid (g) — 1.03 1.03 Cysteine (g) — 0.26 0.26 Glutamic acid (g) — 1.67 1.67 Glycine (g) — 0.19 0.19 Histidine (g) — 0.18 0.18 Isoleucine (g) — 0.64 0.64 Leucine (g) — 1.04 1.04 Lysine (g) — 0.84 0.84 Methionine (g) — 0.23 0.23 Phenylalanine (g) — 0.32 0.32 Proline (g) — 0.59 0.59 Serine (g) — 0.49 0.49 Threonine (g) — 0.68 0.68 Tryptophan (g) — 0.22 0.22 Tyrosine (g) — 0.32 0.32 Valine (g) — 0.58 0.58 ΣNEAA (g) — 4.73 4.73 ΣEAA (g) — 5.27 5.27 Beverage totals Ketone monoester (g) 24.0 –29.7 — 18.3–29.7 Carbohydrate (g) 12.2 24.4 –36.6 1.1 Fat (g) — 0.6 0.6 Protein (g) — 10.0 10.0 Energy (kJ) 586 –815 627 –844 601 –830 ΣEAA, sum total essential amino acids; KET, treatment consisting of 0.36 g/ kg/body weight of the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydrox- ybutyrate; KET þPRO, treatment consisting of 0.36 g/kg/body weight of the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate co-ingested with 10 g whey protein; ΣNEAA, sum total nonessential amino acids; PRO, treatment consisting of 10 g whey protein.
FIGURE 1. Schematic of the experimental protocol.Participants were randomly assigned to consume 1 of the 3 nutritional treatments (KET, PRO, or KETþPRO; n¼12 in each group).A single basal (ie, overnight postabsorptive) biopsy was collected at t¼0 min, followed by the ingestion of the nutritional treatment.Filled circles represent venous blood, capillary blood, and muscle biopsy samples at the respective time points.S.J.Hannaian et al.The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 119 (2024) 716 –729 718 concentration.Then, participants ingested 1 of the 3 nutritional treat- ments based on treatment group randomization (ie, PRO, KET, andKETþPRO).Arterialized venous blood samples (8 mL each) were subsequently collected at t¼15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, and 300 min during the postprandial period after treatment intake.Arte-rialized venous blood samples were drawn into a prechilled 8-mL blood collection tube (BD Vacutainer) coated with K2EDTA.
All tubes were inverted 10 times and centrifuged at 3000 /C2gfor 15 min at 4 /C14C. After centrifugation, the plasma samples were aliquoted out into microtubes.All plasma samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen andtransferred into a /C080 /C14C freezer until further analysis.Capillary blood samples were subsequently collected at t¼30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 min to measure β-OHB concentration using a handheld blood ketone monitor (FreeStyle Precision Neo).The capillary samples werecollected using a lancet after cleaning with alcohol and allowing thearea to air dry.The ﬁrst blood droplet sample was discarded with a cotton swab, and the subsequent droplet samples were used for anal- ysis.Two additional skeletal muscle biopsies were collected at t¼120 min and t¼300 min to permit assessment of temporal changes in MyoPS rates and signaling molecule phosphorylation status betweenthe nutritional treatments in the postprandial state.
All biopsies wereobtained in a distal to proximal manner from the middle region of thevastus lateralis muscle (15 cm above the patella) through separate in-cisions (2 –3 cm apart) ~2 cm below entry through the fascia with a UCH-style skeletal muscle biopsy needle with suction under localanesthesia (2% Lidocaine; Teligent.) [ 14,15]. After muscle biopsy, the incision was closed using a Steristrip and covered with a pressurebandage.Muscle samples were separated from any visible blood, ad- ipose, and connective tissue, then immediately ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at /C080 /C14C until subsequent analysis.

The myo ﬁbrillar pellet was further processed (ie, resolubilized, hydrolyzed, heated, evaporated, andreconstituted) before analysis by ultraperformance liquid chromatog-raphy –mass spectrometry. Calculations The fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of myo ﬁbrillar proteins was assessed using the following standard precursor –product equation: FSRð%=hÞ¼ΔEp/C14/C2 Epl/C2t/C3 /C2100% where ΔEpis the change in protein-bound L-[ ring-2H5]-phenylalanine enrich- ment between 2 muscle biopsies, E plis the weighted mean plasma-free L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine precursor enrichment in mole percentage excess (MPE) across the 2 biopsy samples, and tis the tracer incorporation time in hours.Weighted mean plasma enrichments were calculated by taking the measured enrichment between consecutive time points and correcting for the time between these sampling time points.
The use of tracer-naïve participants in this study allowed the use of the preinfusion blood sample ( t¼/C0180 min; ie, a mixed plasma protein fraction) as the baseline enrichment for the calculation of basal (ie, overnight postabsorptive) FSR. This approach has been previously validated [ 13,16,17].

Statistical analysis We performed a sample size calculation for a 1-way ANOV A F test to compare postprandial MyoPS rates (over 0 –300 min) between 3 treatment groups. We used 0.040%/h as an estimate of the meanpostprandial MyoPS rate for both PRO [ 11] and KET (as we expected them to be similar).We used 0.061%/h as an estimate of the meanpostprandial MyoPS rate for KET þPRO, representing a MyoPS rate >50% greater than both PRO and KET.We also estimated the SD of postprandial MyoPS rates across treatment groups to be 0.015%/h [ 11, 18].Using G *Power software (version 3.1.9.7) [ 19,20], we found that with a signi ﬁcance level ( α) of 0.05 and an effect size ( f) of 0.66, a sample size of at least 9 per treatment group would be suf ﬁcient to detect a difference in MyoPS rates of 0.021%/h with a power (1 /C0β)o f>0.8.However, to account for dropouts, we recruited 12 participants per treatment group.
Plasma glucose, insulin, amino acid, and β-OHB concentration data were assessed using a 2-factor (treatment /C2time) repeated-measures ANOV A and 1 factor (treatment) ANOV A [for incremental area underthe curve (iAUC)].

Myoﬁbrillar FSR Myoﬁbrillar FSR during both the early (0 –120 min) and late (120 –300 min) phase of the postprandial period ( Figure 7 A) was signi ﬁcantly greater (time: P¼0.001) than that in basal postabsorptive conditions (/C0180 to 0 min), with no differences between treatment groups (treat- ment: P¼0.301) or treatment /C2time interaction (interaction: P¼0.822).

Discussion In this study, we evaluated postprandial changes in capillary blood β-OHB, plasma glucose, insulin, and amino acid concentrations, MyoPS rates, and the phosphorylation status of select protein targetswithin the Akt-mTORC1 signaling cascade in response to acute ingestion of a ketone monoester (KET), 10 g whey protein (PRO), or their co-ingestion (KET þPRO) administered in the overnight post- absorptive state in healthy young males.KET and KET þPRO elevated capillary blood β-OHB concentration ( β-OHB C max>3.0 mmol/L) compared with PRO.
Both PRO and KET þPRO increased post- prandial plasma amino acid concentration; however, both the temporaland iAUC response differed between treatments. Leucine, EAA, andTAA iAUC over the 300-min postprandial period was greater in bothPRO and KET þPRO than that in KET.In addition, leucine and EAA iAUC was greater in KET þPRO than that in PRO.KET, PRO, and KETþPRO ingestion increased postprandial MyoPS rates higher than basal postabsorptive rates with no difference between treatments.There was no discernable difference among treatments in the phosphorylationstatus of mTORC1-related signaling targets at the time pointsexamined.Consistent with work from our laboratory [ 4] and others [ 3,9], acute oral ingestion of the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate resulted in a pronounced ( β-OHB C max>3.0 mmol/L), rapid (within ~30 min), but transient (~180 min) nutritional FIGURE 7.

Both treatments induced a similar pronounced, rapid, but transient rise in blood β-OHB concentration, consistent with ﬁndings from other studies using a similar dose of the same ketone monoester [ 3,4]. This con ﬁrms that exogenous ketone monoester drinks represent an ef ﬁcacious way to induce ketosis.Intravenous ketone body infusions have been reported to stimulate pancreatic β-cell insulin secretion [ 21–23].Similarly, studies using exogenous ketone monoester drinks have reported an increase in bloodinsulin concentration in the fasted state [ 24,25] and during a post- exercise hyperglycemic clamp [ 26].The greater increase in plasma insulin concentration in PRO compared with KET and KET þPRO at 15 min in the postprandial period is likely due to the greater amount oftotal carbohydrate ingested ( Table 1 ).
Although insulin is a key peptide hormone involved in the regulation of muscle protein turnover, asystematic review and meta-analysis concluded its primary role is tosuppress muscle protein breakdown rather than stimulate MPS rates[27]. For example, Greenhaff et al.[ 28] reported that MPS rates were identical in response to an EAA infusion whether insulin was “clam- ped”at basal postabsorptive (5 mU/L) or physiologically high (167 mU/L) concentration.Therefore, in this study subtle differences ininsulin concentration between treatments are unlikely to have in ﬂu- enced postprandial MyoPS rates.The postprandial increase in circulating EAA and leucine in particular, after protein ingestion, is a key regulator of MPS rates[29–32].
Although previous studies have examined the effects of protein co-ingestion with carbohydrate [ 33–35] or fat [ 36,37]o n postprandial plasma aminoacidemia, this study is the ﬁrst, to our knowledge, to investigate the effects of ketone monoester co-ingestion with protein on postprandial plasma amino acid concentrations. As expected, there was an increase in postprandial plasma leucine con-centration ( Figure 5 A,B) after both PRO and KET þPRO; however, KETþPRO resulted in a more protracted leucinemia and greater iAUC than that in PRO.Similar ﬁndings were observed for plasma EAA (Figure 5 C,D) and TAA ( Figure 5 E,F) concentration.The reason(s) for differences in postprandial plasma amino acid concentrations betweenPRO and KET þPRO is unclear, but may relate to differences in plasma insulin concentration in PRO compared with KET þPRO ( Figure 4 C, D).
Previous studies [ 38,39] have reported that increases in plasma insulin concentration can reduce plasma amino acid concentration.Insulin plays a key role in facilitating increases in microvascular perfusion [ 40] and supporting amino acid delivery/uptake into skeletal muscle [ 41]. Therefore, the attenuated increase in postprandial plasma amino acid concentration that coincided with a greater increase incirculating insulin concentration may suggest that disappearance ofamino acids from the circulation into skeletal muscle was enhanced inPRO than that in KET þPRO.Alternatively, KET þPRO may have decreased amino acid retention in splanchnic tissues compared withPRO, allowing more of the ingested amino acids to become available inthe circulation.Future studies assessing protein digestion/absorption kinetics could address this question.Ketone bodies have long been implicated in the regulation of pro- tein metabolism during prolonged fasting and starvation [ 42,43].
During prolonged glucose deprivation, ketone bodies replace glucoseas the primary fuel for the brain, supplying >50% of the brain ’s energy [44]. Starvation-induced ketosis may reduce the requirement for pro- tein (muscle) catabolism to provide gluconeogenic amino acid pre- cursors [ 5,45,46].In support of this notion, hyperketonemia is associated with improved nitrogen balance in traumatized man [ 47] and postoperative patients [ 48].Furthermore, infusion of sodium DL-β-OHB reduces plasma alanine concentration and urinary nitrogen excretion in response to prolonged fasting [ 5].More recent research has demonstrated that β-OHB has potent anti-proteolytic effects in muscle during acute in ﬂammatory stress [ 49] and under catabolic conditions characterized by combined systemic in ﬂammation, fasting, and bed rest [50].There is also evidence that β-OHB can stimulate MPS rates [ 8,9].For example, Nair et al.
[ 8] reported that an 8-h intravenous infusion of sodium DL- β-OHB (12.5 μmol/kg/min) to a plasma β-OHB of ~2 mM, reduced leucine oxidation by ~30%, and stimulated mixed MPS rates by ~10% in healthy young adults. In this study, KET, PRO, andKETþPRO elicited a similar increase in postprandial MyoPS rates (Figure 7 A,B), despite no exogenous source of amino acids in KET, and pronounced differences in the change in postprandial plasmaleucine and EAA concentration in PRO and KET þPRO.The post- prandial increase in MyoPS rates over 0 –300 min (~36%) in PRO is similar to that of other studies examining the effects of a 10-g dose ofwhey protein in resting muscle (~22% –24%) [ 11,18].Although leucine and EAA are key nutrient regulators of MPS, differences in the patternof postprandial plasma amino acid concentration do not always trans- late to differences in MPS rates [ 51–54].
Furthermore, MPS rates can be stimulated in the absence of exogenous leucine or EAA using theleucine metabolite β-hydroxy- β-methylbutyrate [ 55] and amino acid citrulline [ 56]. The stimulation of MyoPS rates in KET must have been supported using EAA from other pools (eg, plasma, intracellular, orprotein through tissue protein breakdown).Although ketone bodieshave been reported to potentiate protein synthesis in vitro in low-dose(1.5 mM) leucine-stimulated myotubes [ 9], we observed no additional stimulatory effect of KET þPRO on MyoPS rates.This suggests that amino acid availability and/or nutrient signals that serve to stimulateMyoPS were similar in all treatments.Signaling via the mTORC1 pathway did not differ between basal and postprandial conditions regardless of treatment ( Figure 8 A–J).It is possible that the timing of biopsy sample collection (120 and 300 min)may have missed the “window ”to capture changes in anabolic signaling events.
Typically, signaling responses peak within 1 –2ho f feeding [ 57–59] and, so, any signaling events that occurred <2h posttreatment may have been missed [ 60]. Alternatively, discordance between MPS rates and anabolic signaling events in response tonutritional stimulation in human muscle has been previously reportedFIGURE 8.Phosphorylation status of p-AktSer473(A), p-mTORSer2448(C), p-p70S6KThr389(E), p-4E-BP1Thr37/46(G), and p-rpS6Ser240/244(I) during basal (ie, overnight postabsorptive) conditions and at 120 and 300 min during postprandial conditions after beverage intake in young males.Representative We stern blot images and loading control for the phosphorylation status of p-AktSer473(B), p-mTORSer2448(D), p-p70S6KThr389(F), p-4E-BP1Thr37/46(H), and p-rpS6Ser240/244 (J) during basal conditions ( t¼0 min) and at 120 and 300 min during postprandial conditions after beverage intake in young males.Values represent means /C6 95% CI and individual participant data, n¼12 per treatment.
Data were analyzed with 2-factor repeated-measures ANOVA. 4E-BP1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; Akt, protein kinase B; AU, arbitrary unit; KET, treatment consisting of 0.36 g/kg/body weight of the ketone m onoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate; KET þPRO, treatment consisting of 0.36 g/kg/body weight of the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3- hydroxybutyrate co-ingested with 10 g whey protein; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; p70S6K, 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase; PRO, treatme nt consisting of 10 g whey protein; rpS6, ribosomal protein S6.S.J.Hannaian et al.The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 119 (2024) 716 –729 726 [28].In contrast to this study, Vandoorne et al.
[ 9] reported that ketone monoester co-ingestion with a high-dose protein –carbohydrate drink throughout (every 30 min) 300 min of postexercise recovery enhancedthe phosphorylation status of 4E-BP1% γand S6K1 Thr389at 300 min compared with the same protein –carbohydrate drink with long-chain triglycerides. Differences between this study and that of Vandoorne et al.[ 9] may relate to the exercise stimulus and greater dose of ingested protein/leucine (leucine intake: ~12.1 /C60.4 g per participant).The speciﬁc molecular mechanisms by which ketone bodies regulate MyoPS in humans requires additional research.There are some potential limitations to this study that warrant acknowledgment.First, we did not include a negative control (eg,ﬂavored water) with which to compare KET, PRO, and KET þPRO treatments.Nonetheless, all treatments stimulated postprandial MyoPSrates higher than basal rates.
Second, although carbohydrate was addedto both KET and PRO treatments to better match the energy of theKETþPRO treatment, this may have augmented blood glucose and insulin responses, and thereby plasma amino acid concentration. However, given insulin per se does not stimulate MPS rates in humans[27], subtle differences in insulin concentration between treatments are unlikely to have in ﬂuenced the postprandial MyoPS response.Third, to evaluate their effects on the selected outcome measures, nutritionaltreatments were administered in the overnight postabsorptive state.However, meal intake before ingestion of a ketone monoester drink hasbeen reported [ 24] to reduce blood β-OHB C maxby ~33% compared with ingestion of the same ketone monoester drink on an emptystomach ( β-OHB: 3.3 compared with 2.2 mmol/L).Therefore, whether the effects reported in this study would also occur after ketone monoester administration in the fed state is unclear.
Finally, only young males were studied because our primary outcome measure (MyoPSrates) may have been confounded by mixed-sex and/or age-relatedresponses to ketone monoester intake. Research exploring the effectsof ketone bodies on protein metabolism in females and in older adultswho may display anabolic resistance to nutritional stimuli is needed.In conclusion, we demonstrate that acute intake of a ketone monoester, with or without dietary protein co-ingestion, results inelevated β-OHB/hyperketonemia.Ketone monoester co-ingestion with dietary protein augments the increase in postprandial plasmaleucine, EAA, and TAA concentration compared with dietary protein without ketone monoester co-ingestion.
Despite differences in post- prandial plasma aminoacidemia, acute ingestion of a ketone mono-ester (0.36 g/kg/body weight) eliciting a β-OHB C maxof ~3.2 mmol/ L, 10 g whey protein, or their co-ingestion in the overnight post-absorptive state elicit similar increases in postprandial MyoPS rates invivo in healthy young males.
