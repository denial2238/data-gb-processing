Value of the Data • With more than 11,0 0 0 unique atomic structure ﬁles along with their corresponding spec- troscopy and diffraction characterizations, this dataset provides researchers access to a sub- stantial range of material states in different material systems without requiring to perform additional costly atomistic simulations or associated generation of spectroscopy and diffrac- tion data. • Atomistic structure ﬁles may be used by researchers to perform their own characterization using a variety of publicly available software packages if they desire access to material prop- erties that were not included in the dataset (for example, point defect densities, stacking fault area, etc.).
• With access to both spectroscopy and diffraction data, researchers, material scientists, and data scientists can compare the atomic structure ﬁles or the provided material properties to either modality or perform multimodal analysis that combines the information encoded in the spectroscopy and diffraction data to create better correlations to material properties or atomic structures. • This dataset can be used to develop or test empirical relations between spectroscopy and diffraction data to global or local microstructural properties, or to aid in the development of machine-learning methods for performing a variety of tasks related to connecting atomic structures, material properties, and popular materials characterization techniques.D.Vizoso and R.Dingreville / Data in Brief 55 (2024) 110689 3 2.Background Spectroscopy and diffraction measurements are frequently used non-destructive characteri- zation techniques to extract a wide variety of material properties.
Diffraction techniques, such as X-ray (XRD) or neutron diffraction, provide information on the spatial arrangement of atoms within crystalline materials. When X-rays encounter a crystalline sample, they diffract in speciﬁc directions due to the periodic arrangement of atoms in the crystal lattice.This diffraction pattern contains information about the spacing and orientation of the crystal planes within the material.By analysing the angles and intensities of the diffracted X-rays, researchers can deduce the crys- tal structure, including parameters such as lattice constants, unit cell dimensions, and atomic positions.On the other hand, vibrational spectroscopy, such as infrared or Raman spectroscopy, probe the atomic structure vibrations and interactions within materials, offering information re- garding the nature of chemical composition and bonds.Different chemical bonds exhibit charac- teristic vibrational frequencies, resulting in a shift in wavelength.
The corresponding vibrational density of state (VDoS) spectrum provides information about atomic vibrations, crystal symme- try, and chemical bonding, complementing the insights obtained from diffractograms. As such, in the dataset provided in this Data in Brief, we generated a database of atomic structures with and without disorder and with and without mechanical loading.For each of these atomic structures we generated the corresponding XRD and VDoS spectra.Traditional analysis of spectroscopy and diffraction spectra is typically performed manually via peak analysis and is prone to biases introduced by the practitioner or by the speciﬁc analysis techniques used that can lead to inconsistent results or inaccurate predictions.
This dataset was created for the purpose of testing various machine-learning (ML) methods for extracting material properties from spectroscopic and diffraction data [ 1 , 2 ], with sub-objectives of testing how well ML techniques can be used to automate the analysis of these types of datasets without requiring human intervention as well as to test whether additional material properties could be extracted from these datasets via ML techniques that are typically considered inaccessible via traditional analysis methods. A portion of the Si data provided in this dataset was used for a previous publication [ 1 ], and this represents a substantially expansion of that work, providing researchers the ability to test their approaches on multiple characterization modalities and across multiple material systems.3.Data Description The dataset is available with open access [ 3 ]: https://acdc.alcf.anl.gov/mdf/detail/sandia_vdos_ xrd_si_fe_mg_si_v1.1/ .

Experimental Design, Materials and Methods This dataset contains and is derived from a set of monocrystalline, fully periodic (i.e., bulk) silicon (Si), gold (Au), magnesium (Mg), and iron (Fe) atomic structures that were created and simulated using the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) [ 4 ]. The interatomic potentials used to describe the interatomic interactions in these four materials as well as sample LAMMPS input scripts for all the simulations performed to create the data provided in this dataset are provided as part of the dataset.XRD proﬁles were created using the compute xrd modiﬁer in LAMMPS [ 5 ], while VDoS proﬁles were created via the velocity autocor- relation function (VACF) method [ 1 ], with the VACF computed using the compute vacf modiﬁer in LAMMPS.The vibrational density of states (VDoS) was calculated from the collected VACF data via the FFT method in a Python script, which is also included as part of the dataset.
Measure- ments of characteristic materials descriptors of the simulated atomic structures such as phase fractions and dislocation densities were performed using the Open Visualization Tool (OVITO) [ 5 ], with the scripts used to generate the provided outputs present in the dataset itself. Molecular dynamics simulations of Si were performed with a modiﬁed embedded atom method (MEAM) interatomic potential developed by Lenosky et al.[ 6 ], with the cubic diamond structure having an initial lattice constant of 5.431˚A.Simulations of the compression or ten- sion of Si without the introduction of disorder were performed with a supercell consisting of 12 ×12 ×12 unit cells containing 13,824 atoms.Simulations of Si involving the introduction of disorder (see description of the method later on in this manuscript) were performed with a su- percell consisting of 19 ×19 ×19 unit cells containing 54,872 atoms.
Simulations of Au were per- formed with an embedded atom method (EAM) potential developed by Sheng et al. [ 7 ], with an initial lattice constant of 4.078˚A and an initial crystallographic structure of face-centered cubic (FCC).Most Au simulations were performed with a supercell consisting of 63 ×63 ×63 units cell containing a total of 10 0 0,188 atoms, while the size of the simulation box for the single cascade simulations were scaled based on the energy of the Primary Knock-on Atom (PKA) .Simula- tions of Mg were performed with an EAM potential developed by Pei et al.[ 8 ], with an initial lattice constant of 3.2094 ˚A and an initial crystallographic structure of hexagonal close-packed (HCP).Most Mg simulations were performed with a supercell consisting of 90 ×52 ×53 unit cells containing a total of 992,160 atoms, while the size of the simulation box for the single cascade simulations were scaled based on the energy of the PKA.
Simulations of Fe were performed with an EAM potential that included a modiﬁcation styled after Finnis-Sinclair potentials [ 9 ], with an initial lattice constant of 2.85528 ˚A and an initial crystallographic structure of body-centered cubic (BCC). Most Fe simulations were performed with a supercell consisting of 80 ×80 ×80 unit cells containing a total of 1024,0 0 0 atoms, while the size of the simulation box for the single cascade simulations were scaled based on the energy of the PKA.D.Vizoso and R.Dingreville / Data in Brief 55 (2024) 110689 9 All the cubic structures (Si, Au, and Fe) were oriented such that the ⟨100 ⟩ family of crystal- lographic directions were along the x, y , and z axes of the simulation box.For Mg, the [0 0 01 ] direction was oriented along the z axis of the simulation box, the [10¯1 0 ] direction was oriented along the x axis, and the [01¯1 0 ] direction was oriented along the y axis.
Prior to the introduction of disorder or the application of any mechanical load, each of the atomic structures was equilibrated at 300 K and zero pressure under an isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble for a minimum of 200 ps. All simulations of compression or tension were per- formed under a canonical (NVT) ensemble at a constant temperature of 300 K, with the com- pression or tension of the simulation cell being handled by the ﬁx deform command in LAMMPS using atomic displacements.All mechanical simulations were strain-controlled with constant en- gineering strain rates of 10−4 ps−1 (108 s−1 ).For Si, Fe, and Au simulations, simulations of uniaxial tension or compression were per- formed along the ⟨ 001 ⟩ direction while maintaining the dimensions of the simulation cell in the ⟨100 ⟩ and ⟨010 ⟩ directions.
For Mg simulations, uniaxial tension or compression simulations were performed along the [0 0 01 ] , [10¯1 0 ] , or [01¯1 0 ] directions while keeping the other two di- mensions constant. Hydrostatic simulations of tension or compression in the cubic structures (i.e., Si, Fe, and Au) were performed by reducing or expanding the dimensions of the simulation cells along each of the ⟨100 ⟩ directions at strain rates computed with the following relation: 1 +ε to t = (1 +ε xx )(1 +ε yy )(1 +ε zz ) , where ε to t is the previously deﬁned strain rate of 10−4 ps−1 , and ε xx , ε yy , and ε zz are the strain rates along each of the simulation cell axes.All simulations of uniaxial or hydrostatic tension or compression were performed to a ﬁnal engineering strain of 30 %.Disorder was introduced to the atomic structures via two different approaches.For the Si structures, disorder was introduced in the form of Frenkel pairs (vacancy and self-interstitial atom pairs), as described in [ 1 , 10–12 ].
In this approach, disorder was introduced in a step-wise fashion where during each disorder insertion step, 50 randomly selected atoms were displaced from their original position by a randomly sampled distance between 20 and 60˚A. The positions of the displaced atoms were adjusted until no atoms were closer than 2˚A from any neighbor atoms.After 50 atoms were selected and displaced, the system was allowed to evolve under an NPT ensemble maintained at zero pressure for 0.5 ps with a timestep of 0.1 fs, followed by a 2.5 ps evolution with a timestep of 0.5 fs.These disorder insertion steps were repeated until the total number of displaced atoms equaled the number of atoms within the structure.For Au, Mg, and Fe structures, disorder was introduced using the reduced-order atomistic cascade (ROAC) method [ 10 ].
In the ROAC method, multiple damage events consisting of ther- mally excited core regions and ballistic shells are inserted into the microstructure and evolved in time, resulting in thermally induced mixing in the core regions and the creation of interstitial- type defects in the shell regions. The number of atoms involved in each region for each damage event is determined with an extension of the Norgett-Robinson-Torrens (NRT) dpa model [ 13 , 14 ], as well as an event energy that is sampled from a primary recoil spectrum computed for each material [ 10 , 15 ].For all materials, an incident ion energy of 1 MeV was used to compute the primary recoil spectra, with the sampling of the spectrum being truncated to exclude the top 5 % of energies for the Au and Fe material systems while the top 3 % of energies were ex- cluded for the Mg material system.
For disordering simulation of Au, 800 damage events were inserted during each damage step, with the dynamics of the system between damage inser- tion steps progressing as 0.5 ps with a timestep size of 0.1 fs, then 70 ps with a timestep size of 1 fs. For disordering simulations of Fe and Mg, 1500 and 500 damage events were in- serted per damage step respectively, with the dynamics of the systems between damage in- sertion stpes progressing as 70 ps with a timestep of 1 fs.Table 6 contains the material con- stants for the modiﬁed NRT-dpa defect production model used as part of the ROAC method.LAMMPS input scripts for performing defect insertion via both methods are provided in the dataset.The process of attaining the constants provided in Table 6 is described in references [ 10 , 15 ], and involves performing a series of single cascade (or PKA) simulations at different event ener- 10 D.Vizoso and R.

Material bdpa cdpa brpa crpa Ed (eV) Au −1.1 0.10 1800 1.05 35.0 Fe −0.85 0.11 2500 0.95 40.0 Mg −1.0 0.315 434.835 1.34866 16.5 gies.Defected structures produced by these single cascade simulations are also included in the dataset, alongside their corresponding VDoS and XRD spectra.Simulations that involved both disorder and mechanical loading were performed in the fol- lowing manner.First, disorder insertion simulations were performed to a desired damage level using the disorder insertion method appropriate for the material as deﬁned above.Then, com- pressive or tensile loading simulations were performed with the disordered structures directly, with no stress relaxation prior to the beginning of the mechanical loading simulations.
Stress information was computed directly within the molecular dynamics simulations and written to a text ﬁles by LAMMPS directly. Stress data is stored in the dataset as directional components in the following order: x, y, z, xy, xz, yz.Phase fraction information was computed from the atomistic structure ﬁles created during the molecular dynamics simulations via the ‘common neighbor analysis’ modiﬁer [ 16 ] within OVITO [ 17 ] using default parameters.Disloca- tion content information was computed from the atomistic structure ﬁles via the ‘dislocation analysis’ modiﬁer [ 18 ] within OVITO.For all of the Au, Mg, and Fe structures, the ‘dislocation analysis’ modiﬁer was run with input crystal types of FCC, HCP, and BCC.VDoS data is obtained via the following process.First, a molecular dynamics simulation is performed where the VACF is measured using the compute vacf command in LAMMPS.
This simulation is performed under an NVT ensemble maintained at 300 K for a simulated time of 400 ps, where the velocity autocorrelation value is recorded every 0.01 ps. The VDoS is then computed by taking the Fourier transform of the VACF data to convert it into the frequency domain.The result of the Fourier transform contains both real and imaginary components; the data provided in the ‘VDoS_Files’ subdirectories in the dataset only contain the real components.XRD data is obtained directly from a LAMMPS simulation, where the atomic structure ﬁle is read in and the ‘compute xrd’ command is called in LAMMPS.Simulations for determining the XRD proﬁles of Si microstructures were performed with an X-ray wavelength of 1.541838 ˚A, a 2 θrange from 20 °to 85 °, and a reciprocal lattice resolution of 0.006˚A−1 .
Simulations for determining the XRD proﬁles of Au, Fe, and Mg microstructures were performed with an X-ray wavelength 0f 1.54˚A, a 2 θrange from 30 °to 90 °, and a reciprocal lattice spacing of 0.005˚A−1 .
