Using a biotinylated goat anti -rat antibody, we detect ed the localization of cells bound to the in vivo antibodies for PD -1 and CTLA -4. IHC has advantages over other techniques , namely antibody availability, resistance to photobleaching, and greater sensitivity.Additionally, detection and localization of in vivo antibodies can be used in mice models to infer their therapeutic efficacy, stability , and function.Graphic al abstrac t: Keywo rds: Immune checkpoint blockade , Immunohistochemistry, Mice models , Immune related Adverse Events (irAEs) , Programmed cell Death protein 1 (PD -1), Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Associated protein 4 (CTLA -4), T cells , Antibody [Background ] The last decade has seen the approval of several immune checkpoint block ade (ICB) antibodies in various cancers , which has improved patient survival .However, p atients that respond to these ICB develop toxicities known as irAEs .
We have previously developed a novel mouse model of irAEs in B6/lpr mice , that developed multiorgan toxicities with immune infiltration , when given a Copyright © 20 22 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio -protocol LLC. 2 www.bio -protocol.org/e4468 Bio-protocol 12(14): e4468 .DOI:10.21769/BioProtoc.4468 5111112000 combination of anti -PD-1 and anti -CTLA -4 (Adam et al., 2021) .Mice were injected with 200 μg of anti - PD1 (BioXCell BE0146) , and 100 μg of CTLA -4 (BioXcell BE0131) antibodies intraperitoneal ly twice a week for 6 weeks.Mice were sacrificed at endpoint , and tissue collected for IHC, to assess the cellular landscape.The injected ICB antibodies derived from rat were visualized in the tissue using a goat anti - rat that recognize d the fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of the IgG rat antibody.This method of detection could be used to evaluate ICB antibodies for toxicity in mice models.
Although there are numerous other techniques for visualization or detection of antibodies ( de Boer et al. , 2015 ; Mestel, 2017; Knight et al., 2019; Wen et al., 2021), t he limitations are the access to large and expensive microscopes, CT scanner, or MRI , which may be inaccessible to many laboratories.Our method is advantageous due to a relatively low expense, accessible selection of conjugated antibodies , and flexibility with IHC kits.Materials and Reagents 1.Tissue Tek Slide Staining Dish (Fisher, cat alog number: NC0731403) 2.Slide Holder (Fisher, catalog number: NC9697666 3.10 mL pre -filled flush syringe saline (NaCl 0.9%) (BD, catalog number: 306575) 4.25G × ¾’’ blood collection set (BD, catalog number: 367285) 5.FisherbrandTM ColorFrostTM Plus Microscope Slides (Fisher, catalog number: 12 -550-17) 6.FisherbrandTM Standard Disposable Transfer Pipettes, Nongraduated (Fisher, catalog number: 13 - 711-7M) 7.
