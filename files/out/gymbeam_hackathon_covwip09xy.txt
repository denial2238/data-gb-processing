REVIEW ARTICLE Antiresorptive Versus Anabolic Therapy in Managing Osteoporosis in People with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Tatiane Vilaca and Richard Eastell Mellanby Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Department of Oncology and Metabolism, University of Shef ﬁeld, Shef ﬁeld, UK Abstract Diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia, but the two main types, type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), have distinct pathophysiology and epidemiological pro ﬁles.Individuals with T1D and T2D have an increased risk of fractures, particularly of the hip, upper arm, ankle, and nonvertebral sites.The risk of fractures is higher in T1D compared to T2D.The diagnosis of osteoporosisin individuals with T1D and T2D follows similar criteria as in the general population, but treatment thresholds may differ.Antiresorp- tive therapies, the ﬁrst-line treatment for osteoporosis, are effective in individuals with T2D.
Observational studies and post hoc analyses of previous trials have indicated that antiresorptive drugs, such as bisphosphonates and selective estrogen receptor mod-ulators, are equally effective in reducing fracture risk and increasing bone mineral density (BMD) in individuals with and without T2D.Denosumab has shown similar effects on vertebral fracture risk but increases the risk of nonvertebral fractures. Considering the lowbone turnover observed in T1D and T2D, anabolic therapies, which promote bone formation and resorption, have emerged as apotential treatment option for bone fragility in this population.Data from observational studies and post hoc analyses of previoustrials also showed similar results in increasing BMD and reducing the risk of fractures in people with or without T2D.However, noevidence suggests that anabolic therapy has greater ef ﬁcacy than antiresorptive drugs.In conclusion, there is an increased risk of fractures in T1D and T2D.
Reductions in BMD cannot solely explain the relationship between T1D and T2D and fractures. Bonemicroarchitecture and other factors play a role.Antiresorptive and anabolic therapies have shown ef ﬁcacy in reducing fracture risk in individuals with T2D, but the evidence is more robust for antiresorptive drugs.Evidence in T1D is scant.Further research is neededto fully understand the underlying mechanisms and optimize management strategies for bone fragility in T1D and T2D.© 2023 TheAuthors.JBMR Plus published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.KEY WORDS: ANABOLIC TREATMENT; ANTIRESORPTIVE TREATMENT; DIABETES; OSTEOPOROSIS Introduction Diabetes mellitus represents a global health burden.Recent studies report that the disease affected 9.3% of the world population (463 million people) in 2019, and estimates suggest it will rise to 10.2% (578 million) by 2030 and 10.9% (700 million)by 2045.
[1]One in two people living with diabetes does not know they have the disease.[1]Hyperglycemia is the hallmark of diabe- tes, but distinctive pathophysiological and epidemiological pro-ﬁles characterize the two main types. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, resulting in insulin de ﬁ- ciency.T1D primarily affects young individuals.The incidencerates display regional variation, ranging from 1 to 20 cases per 100,000 person-years, with higher rates observed in developed countries.Conversely, type 2 diabetes (T2D), characterized byinsulin resistance and impaired beta-cell function, typicallydevelops later in life and is strongly associated with lifestylefactors such as obesity and sedentary behavior.Globally, T2D accounts for most diabetes cases, with increasing prevalenceacross all continents, driven by aging populations, urbanization,and unhealthy lifestyles.
[1]The epidemiology of the two main types of diabetes underscores the multifaceted interplaybetween genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and life-style behaviors, emphasizing the need for comprehensive strate- gies targeting prevention, early detection, and management of these chronic conditions. In this manuscript, we discuss the ratio-nale for the use of antiresorptive, anabolic, and dual-mechanismantiosteoporosis therapies in T1D and T2D.We review the cur-rent literature, examine the evidence, and summarize the keyﬁndings on ef ﬁcacy and safety.The risk of fractures in type 1 and type 2 diabetes T1D and T2D are associated with an increased risk of fractures at most sites investigated.

[2,3,5 ]In T1D, the risk of hip frac- tures is 393% higher,[2]while the risk of any fractures was 216% higher and spine fractures 188% higher[6]than those without diabetes. Conversely, in T2D, there is a 33% increase in the riskof hip fractures, a 19% increase in the risk of nonvertebralfractures, [2]a 54% increase in the risk of upper arm fracture, a 22% increase in any fracture, and a 15% increase in ankle frac- ture.[3]In T2D, the risk was higher in those younger, those using insulin, and those with a longer duration of diabetes.[2] Areal bone mineral density in type 1 and type 2 diabetes Reductions in bone density do not explain the increased risk of fractures in people with T1D and T2D.The classical patternreported is that areal bone mineral density (aBMD) is decreasedin T1D and normal or increased in T2D.[5]Body mass index (BMI) was found to be a major determinant of aBMD, while gly-cated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was not linked to aBMD.
[5]More recent studies have found that adults with T1D have a modestlylower aBMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine than adultswithout diabetes. [7]Due to the early onset of T1D, the hypothesis that the disease could compromise the peak of bone massaccrual was also raised to explain the increased risk of fractures.However, Halper-Stromberg et al.have compared aBMD acrossthe lifespan in individuals with T1D and age- and sex-matchedhealthy controls.[8]The study found that lumbar spine aBMD was similar in patients with T1D compared with age- and sex-matched participants without diabetes, except in postmeno-pausal women with T1D who had a lower lumbar spine, femoralneck, and total hip aBMD.[8]Therefore, low aBMD cannot fully explain the greater fracture risk observed in adults with T1D.Microarchitecture Several authors have investigated bone microarchitecture in T1Dand T2D using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computedtomography (HR-pQCT), and the results are con ﬂicting.
Recently, a meta-analysis has summarized the ﬁndings and concluded that T1D is associated with adverse trabecular characteristics at theradius, while T2D is associated with favorable trabecular charac-teristics but adverse cortical features also at the radius. [9] Although meta-analyses are empowered by including severalstudies and large numbers, it is important to acknowledge thatseveral groups of participants with different characteristics havebeen included.In the studies that investigated T2D, higher corti-cal porosity was a common ﬁnding, both at the radius [10–13]and tibia,[11,12 ]especially in those participants who had microvascu- lar disease[13]or experienced a fracture.[14]Higher cortical poros- ity was also reported at the tibia in participants with T1D andneuropathy.
[15]Despite these ﬁndings in microarchitecture and unfavorable ﬁndings in ﬁnite element analysis,[12,16 ]the results suggest that compromised microarchitecture contributesto bone fragility in T1D and T2D but does not fully explain theincreased risk of fractures observed. Other features Histomorphometry studies comparing samples from T1D andT2D to people without diabetes yield con ﬂicting ﬁndings.The results showed no differences in T1D [17]and unfavorable ﬁnd- ings associated with poor disease control and chronic complica-tions in T2D.[18,19 ]Despite these ﬁndings, overall bone resorptionand formation markers are low and poorly predictive of fracture risk.[20–23]Therefore, bone turnover is reduced, and there are notable alterations in bone material properties and microstruc-ture.These changes are more pronounced when microvascularcomplications are present.
[13,15,16 ]Developing bone fragility in T1D and T2D involves intricate pathophysiological mechanisms,including hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and the accumulationof advanced glycation end products (AGEs). [24,25 ]These factors compromise the properties of collagen, promote increased mar-row adiposity, release in ﬂammatory factors and adipokines from visceral fat, and potentially affect the function of osteocytes.[24,25 ] A recent study evaluated the gene expression in bone sam- ples from postmenopausal women with or without T2D under-going hip replacement surgery.The study found that SOSTgene expression was upregulated in T2D, but sclerostin levels(the product of the SOST gene) did not differ between peoplewith and without T2D.Sclerostin is a potent inhibitor of thecanonical Wnt signaling pathway and therefore a negative regu-lator of bone formation.They also found increased levels of AGEsin bone samples of people with T2D.
They suggested that theaccumulation of AGEs may contribute to reduced bone forma-tion and impaired bone quality. [26] Other factors, such as treatment-induced hypoglycemia, cer- tain antidiabetic medications (e.g., thiazolidinediones) directlyimpacting bone and mineral metabolism, and an elevated riskof falls, contribute to the heightened fracture susceptibilityobserved in individuals with diabetes mellitus.[25] Osteoporosis diagnosis and management in type 1 and type 2 diabetes The diagnosis of osteoporosis in adults with T1D and T2D is established based on the presence of fragility fractures and/or low aBMD following the diagnostic criteria.[27]However, it is important to differentiate these diagnostic criteria from treat-ment thresholds.It has been observed that prior fracture historyis a strong predictor of future fractures in patients both with andwithout T1D or T2D.
[28]Therefore, treatment should be initiated for patients with T1D or T2D who had an osteoporotic fracture.In addition, experts recommend that treatment be consideredat more favorable Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) andBMD values compared to patients without diabetes [27]since both BMD and FRAX may underestimate the fracture risk in indi-viduals with T2D. [28,29 ]In people with T2D, fracture risk at T-score < /C02 is equivalent for nondiabetes at T-score < /C02.5, and a T-score < /C02 should be used to consider treatment.The FRAX prediction tool does not include an option for T2D, and itis suggested that the option for rheumatoid arthritis be tickedas an alternative strategy to account for the increased risk in thispopulation.[27] Treatment Options Once the need for pharmacological treatment is established, it isimportant to de ﬁne which medication to use.
This manuscript reviews the rationale for using antiresorptive and anabolic treat-ments, available evidence, and safety issues. Rationale for the use of antiresorptive therapy Antiresorptive drugs are the most commonly used drug in thetreatment of osteoporosis.Bisphosphonates are the ﬁrst line therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis.[30]Due to the low JBMR Plus (WOA) n2o f8 VILACA AND EASTELL bone turnover observed in T1D and T2D, there are concerns that antiresorptive therapies, which suppress bone turnover, may notbe as effective in preventing bone loss and fracture in patientswith T1D and T2D.[31]However, this is not supported by the avail- able evidence.Evidence for the use of antiresorptive therapy No trials are explicitly designed to investigate the ef ﬁcacy of anti- osteoporosis drugs in people with T1D or T2D.The current evi-dence comes from observational studies and post hoc analyses of previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
A cohort study from Denmark assessed whether the effect of antiresorptive drugs differed in patients with and without T1Dand T2D. The study found that T1D or T2D did not affect thefracture-preventive potential of bisphosphonates or raloxifene,and the low-turnover state of T1D and T2D did not hinder theeffect of these drugs against osteoporosis.[32] The post hoc analyses of several antiosteoporosis trials have suggested that the ef ﬁcacy and safety of treatment in people with T2D are similar to those without the disease.The post hoc analyses of trials using alendronate[33]and rise- dronate[34]found that these bisphosphonates showed consis- tent safety and ef ﬁcacy in suppressing bone turnover and increasing aBMD in osteoporosis patients with and without dia-betes.Both drugs reduced the rate of fractures and increasedaBMD in participants treated for osteoporosis.
Post hoc analyses of two randomized trials of raloxifene found a reduction in vertebral fractures in women with T2D andwomen without the disease but no reduction in nonvertebralfractures. [35]In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) study, raloxifene showed greater ef ﬁcacy in reducing vertebral fractures in these patients compared with those with-out diabetes.[36] The effect of denosumab in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and T2D was assessed in a post hoc analysis ofthe subgroup with T2D of the Fracture REduction Evaluationof Denosumab in Osteoporosis every 6 Months (FREEDOM)study and its long-term Extension.Denosumab signi ﬁcantly increased BMD and decreased vertebral fracture risk in womenwith osteoporosis and T2D; however, nonvertebral fracture inci-dence was higher with denosumab than placebo in subjects withT2D (11.7% versus 5.9%, p=0.046).
[37]Fractures at the ribs (n=8) and ulna ( n=4) were observed only in those partici- pants with T2D taking denosumab. The numbers of fractures at the radius and humerus were greater in the participants with T2D (8 versus 2 and 7 versus 5, respectively), although there werefewer hip fractures with denosumab than placebo (1 versus 4).However, during the ﬁrst 3 years of FREEDOM Extension, new vertebral and nonvertebral fracture incidences were low in thelong-term and crossover denosumab groups with T2D ( ≤6%), consistent with the overall extension population; yearly nonver-tebral fracture incidence was comparable to that of the FREE-DOM placebo group.[37] The most robust evidence of the ef ﬁcacy of antiresorptive therapies comes from the pooled analysis of individual partici-pant data using the Foundation for the National Institutes ofHealth (FNIH)-American Society for Bone and Mineral Research(ASBMR)-Study to Advance Bone Mineral Density (BMD) as aRegulatory Endpoint (SABRE) cohort.
[38]This unique dataset of individual patient data from randomized, placebo-controlledtrials of osteoporosis therapies included data from 96,385subjects, 6.8% of whom had T2D, from nine bisphosphonatetrials, two selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) trials, two trials of menopausal hormone therapy, one denosumab trial,and one odanacatib trial. The group used Cox regression toobtain the treatment-related hazard ratio (HR) for incident non-vertebral, hip, and all fractures and logistic regression to obtainthe treatment-related odds ratio (OR) for incident radiographicvertebral fractures, separately for T2D and people without diabe-tes.Linear regression was used to estimate the effect of treat-ment on the 2-year change in BMD ( n=49,099) by diabetes status (T2D).In all analyses, the interaction between treatmentand diabetes status was assessed.
In pooled analyses of all 15 tri-als, it was found that T2D did not impact treatment ef ﬁcacy, with similar reductions in vertebral, nonvertebral, all, and hip fracturesand similar increases in lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neckaBMD for the drugs licensed to treat osteoporosis (Fig. 1).They found similar results for the pooled analysis, including only thebisphosphonate trials.However, when they considered trialsindividually, they found an interaction between T2D status andthe effects of denosumab on nonvertebral fracture risk, consis-tent with the data reported in the FREEDOM trial post hoc anal-ysis.Despite the low baseline bone turnover observed inpatients with T2D, this analysis showed that antiresorptive treatment led to a similar reduction in bone turnover markers in people with and without T2D.[38]Thus, the study provides evi- dence that bisphosphonates and most licensed antiresorptivedrugs effectively reduce fracture risk and increase aBMD, irre-spective of T2D status.
However, the study also highlightsthe need for further research into the effects of antiresorptivetreatments on patients with T2D, especially for individualtherapies. Therefore, clinical trials of antiosteoporosis drugs in people with T2D are needed.Safety of antiresorptive therapy Bisphosphonates are generally well tolerated, exhibiting pre-dominantly nonsevere adverse effects.Nevertheless, gastroin-testinal complications, namely re ﬂux and esophageal inﬂammation, are commonly observed.Notably, gastric discom- fort represents a frequently encountered side effect associatedwith bisphosphonates, and in more severe instances, it may giverise to erosions on the esophageal epithelium.To avoid theoccurrence of these adverse effects, it is recommended to main-tain an upright position for 30 –60 min after the oral administra- tion of bisphosphonates.
[30] Emerging evidence suggests an association between long- term antiresorptive use, especially bisphosphonates, and an increased risk of atypical femur fractures (AFFs). These fracturesare characterized by transverse or oblique patterns and minimalor no trauma history and occur at the subtrochanteric and diaph-yseal regions of the femur.The underlying mechanisms respon-sible for this association remain unclear, although hypotheseshave been proposed, including the suppression of bone remo-deling and the accumulation of microdamage.[39]Since these features are also observed in T1D and T2D, there is concernabout the risk of these fractures in these populations.Data from the Danish National Patient Register showed that patients with T1D had a higher risk of subtrochanteric and fem-oral shaft fractures compared to the general population.The19,896 patients with T1D, 312,188 patients with T2D, and996,252 controls were followed from 1996 to 2017.
There wasno increased risk in patients with T2D. Previous fractures andthe use of bisphosphonates were associated with an increasedrisk of these fractures.However, the study was not able to JBMR®Plus OSTEOPOROSIS TREATMENT IN TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES 3o f8n characterize the subtrochanteric and femoral shaft fractures as AFFs.[40] In another study where AFFs were characterized, approxi- mately half of AFFs were not associated with bisphosphonateuse.There were no signi ﬁcant demographic or clinical differ- ences between bisphosphonate and nonbisphosphonate-related AFFs, including T2D.[41]Finally, in another cohort, the risk of AFFs increased with a longer duration of bisphosphonate use,Asian ancestry, shorter stature, overweight, and glucocorticoiduse.Hip BMD, T1D, and T2D were not found to be associatedwith AFF risk.[42]Therefore, despite potential common features, there is no strong evidence that the use of bisphosphonates inT1D or T2D is associated with AFF.
T1D and T2D are considered risk factors for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) , a condition characterized by nonhealing exposed bone in the ja w associated with antiresorptive therapy. [43]There is no consensus on the role of T1D or T2D in thedevelopment of MRONJ.Microvascular ischemia, endothelial cell dysfunction, reduced bone remodeling, and increased apoptosisof bone cells related to T1D and T2D could contribute to the devel-opment of MRONJ.[44]While MRONJ has been associated with hyperglycemia,[45,46 ]studies have produced con ﬂicting results regarding the prevalence of T1D a nd T2D among individuals with MRONJ.Some observational stu dies have not reported a higher prevalence of T2D,[45,46 ]while others have shown an increased prevalence.[44,47 ]Therefore, further research is warranted to eluci- date the underlying mechanisms and clarify the associationbetween hyperglycemia and the development of MRONJ in indi-viduals with T1D and T2D.
Both b isphosphonates and denosumab are associated with an increased i ncidence of MRONJ.

Reproduced with permission from Eastell et al.[38] JBMR Plus (WOA) n4o f8 VILACA AND EASTELL Rationale for the use of anabolic therapy Considering the disproportionately high increase in the risk of fractures compared to the observed effects on bone structureand the low bone turnover observed in people with T1D andT2D, anabolic therapies emerge as an attractive choice. Bone fra-gility in T1D and T2D is characterized by a low bone turnoverstate, in contrast to postmenopausal osteoporosis, which is char-acterized by increased bone turnover.In this scenario, anabolictherapies would increase bone formation and resorption, allow-ing bone renewal, improving bone material properties, andrepairing microcracks.Therefore, we review the current evidenceon using anabolic therapies for treating bone fragility in T1Dand T2D.
Evidence for the use of anabolic therapy In a T2D animal model, T2D signi ﬁcantly decreased aBMD, impaired bone formation, compromised microarchitecture,increased cortical porosity, and reduced bone strength. In thismodel, treatment with teriparatide and abaloparatide effectivelyrestored aBMD and corrected the deteriorated bone architec- ture.[48]Mechanistically, teriparatide and abaloparatide induced similar responses at the tissue and gene signature levels, pro-moting bone formation and resorption with a positive balancefavoring bone gain.Both agents demonstrated the ability torestore bone architecture, correct cortical porosity, and improvethe mechanical properties of bone in animals with T2D.Notably,abaloparatide treatment resulted in increased toughness, indi-cating enhanced fracture resistance.Furthermore, both agentsincreased bone strength, even in the presence of severe hyper-glycemia, surpassing the strength observed in healthycontrols.
[48] There is no speci ﬁc trial on the ef ﬁcacy and safety of anabolic treatments for osteoporosis in humans with T1D or T2D. The evi-dence in T2D is limited to observational studies and post hocanalyses of osteoporosis RCTs.A post hoc analysis of the Abaloparatide Comparator Trial In Vertebral Endpoints (ACTIVE) evaluated the ef ﬁcacy andsafety of abaloparatide in women with T2D.This phase 3 trial included 198 participants with T2D and compared abalopara-tide, teriparatide, and placebo.Abaloparatide and teripara-tide treatments demonstrated signi ﬁcant improvements in aBMD and trabecular bone score (TBS) compared to placebo,consistent with the overall trial population.The subgroupanalysis of the RCT was not powered to assess fractures, butfracture events were reduced with abaloparatide treatmentin T2D patients, especially for n onvertebral fractures, where there was a signi ﬁcant reduction in fractures when compared to placebo.
Safety outcomes were similar to those in theoverall trial population. These ﬁndings suggest that abalo- paratide may effectively reduce fracture risk in patients withT2D.[49] Another post hoc analysis has explored the effects of teriparatide on T2D using real-world data: the Direct Analysis ofNonvertebral Fractures in the Community Experience (DANCE)study.The study found a similar reduction in nonvertebralfracture incidence, increased aBMD, and decreased back painin patients with and without T2D.[50]Another study, which included data from four observational studies (including theDANCE study), found signi ﬁcant reductions in clinical vertebral fractures, nonvertebral fractures, clinical fractures, and hip fractures during teriparatide treatment in people with T2D com-pared to people who did not receive treatment.The studysuggests that for clinical fractures, participants with T2Dresponded better to teriparatide than those without diabetes(Fig.
2).[51]Therefore, current evidence suggests that anabolic therapies have at least similar ef ﬁcacy in patients with T2D com- pared to people without the disease. However, this evidencecomes from observational studies and post hoc analyses; speci ﬁc trials addressing this population are needed.Safety of anabolic therapy There are no speci ﬁc concerns regarding the use of anabolic treatments in people with diabetes.Fig.2.Fracture rates by diabetes mellitus presence or prior bisphosphonate use at baseline and treatment period.Shown are clinical vertebral fracture (left), nonvertebral (middle), and clinical fracture (right) rates per 100 patient-years for the reference period (0 –6 months) versus the postreference period (>6 months) for subgroups based on diabetes mellitus presence at baseline.*p< 0.05; †p< 0.005; ‡p< 0.0001 between periods.

The study on mice found that weekly alendronate treatment prevented T1D-induced osteoblast death and trabecular boneloss. Alendronate also reduced marrow adiposity and increasedbone stiffness but decreased the work required for fracture inmice with T1D.In addition, longer treatment suppressed boneformation and osteoblast markers in mice with T1D.[53]Patients with T1D are usually excluded from RCTs.The Danish observa-tional cohort included data on T1D and T2D and concluded thatthe disease does not affect the fracture prevention potential ofbisphosphonates or raloxifene.The analysis was not strati ﬁed by diabetes type, but when the authors compared the effect ofosteoporosis drugs on the risk of hip fractures, there was no dif-ference between T1D and T2D and people without diabetes.[32] Another observational study has reported the effect of risedro-nate (30 mg/week) in patients with T1D with osteoporosis orosteopenia.
Risedronate use associated with calcium and vitaminD(n=35) resulted in an increase in lumbar spine and femoral neck aBMD after 12 months in patients with osteoporosis, whileno difference was observed in patients who received only cal-cium and vitamin D ( n=17). [54]In light of the lack of evidence regarding osteoporosis treatment in patients with T1D, currentpractice is based on osteoporosis guidelines and data availablefrom T2D.Data on T1D are urgently needed to guide treatmentin this population at high risk of fractures.Dual Mechanism of Action Rationale for the use of romosozumab Sclerostin is involved in the bone ’s adaptive response to mechanical loading.Osteocytes produce sclerostin, which has a dual action: it inhibits the canonical Wnt pathway, resulting inthe suppression of osteoblast activity, and simultaneously stimu-lates the release of receptor activator of NF- κB ligand by osteo- cytes, thereby promoting osteoclast recruitment.
Consequently,the inhibition of sclerostin leads to the stimulation of bone for-mation and the inhibition of bone resorption. Clinical trials inves-tigating romosozumab, an antibody targeting sclerostin, haveshown its ef ﬁcacy in enhancing BMD and reducing fracture risk when compared to both placebo and alendronate.[55,56 ] In animal models, sclerostin antibody treatment reverses the adverse effects of T2D on bone mass and strength and improvesbone defect regeneration.[48,57 ]Previous meta-analysis reported increased sclerostin in both T1D and T2D.[22]In addition, scleros- tin gene expression was reported to be higher in bone samplesof people with T2D than those without the disease.[26]These data suggest that sclerostin might be involved in bone fragilityin T1D and T2D, making antisclerostin antibodies a candidateto treat bone fragility in the disease.
Evidence for the use of romosozumab There is no evidence regarding the ef ﬁcacy and safety of romo- sozumab in patients with T1D or T2D.Safety of romosozumab in T1D and T2D Concerns have been raised regarding the cardiovascular safetyof romosozumab, and its use is not recommended in patientswith high cardiovascular risk. [58]Since T1D and T2D are associ- ated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, it is unlikelythat the bene ﬁts of using romosozumab would outweigh the risk of increasing the cardiovascular risk in this population.Conclusion Available evidence suggests that antiresorptive and anabolictherapies have similar effects on bone density and fracture riskreduction in patients with and without T2D.However, the evi-dence for T2D is limited to observational studies and post hocanalyses of osteoporosis RCTs, and there is scant evidence forT1D.There is no clinical evidence for the use of antisclerostinantibodies in T1D and T2D.
Prospective studies evaluating theeffect of available therapies on bone quality and fracture out-comes in patients with T1D and T2D are needed. Despite the rationale that favors the use of anabolic agents to treat people with T1D and T2D due to the low bone turnover observed, thisis not supported by current evidence.Studies comparing theeffects of bisphosphonates and anabolic agents on people withT1D and T2D would be required to support this practice.Author Contributions Tatiane Vilaca: Conceptualization; methodology; writing – original draft; writing –review and editing.Richard Eastell: Conceptualization; writing –review and editing.Funding Information The authors received no funding for this project.Disclosures Richard Eastell receives consultancy funding from Immunodiag- nostic Systems, Sandoz, Samsung, CL Bio, Biocon, Takeda, UCB,meeting presentations for Pharmacosmos, Alexion, UCB, andAmgen, and grant funding from Alexion.
