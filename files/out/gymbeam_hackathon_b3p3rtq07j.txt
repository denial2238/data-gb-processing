INVITED NUTRIENT INFORMATION Vitamin B-12 Vitamin B-12 (cobalamin) is an essential nutrient required for growth and neurological development.There are 2 currently known enzymes in humans that utilize vitamin B-12 as a cofactor—namely, cytoplasmic methionine synthase and mitochondrial methylmalonyl-CoAmutase.The cytoplasmic reaction with vitamin B-12 in methylcobalamin form converts homocysteine to methio- nine for the synthesis of the principal methyl donor, S- adenosylmethionine, and regenerates tetrahydrofolates from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate for thymidylate synthesis.In the mitochondria,adenosylcobalaminisacofactorforconversionof methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA and so permits oxidationofodd-chainfattyacidsandketogenicaminoacids.Deficiencies In recent years, there have been many scientific advances inunderstanding of the mechanism of absorption and intracel- lular processing of vitamin B-12.
Despite this, the diagnosisof vitamin deficiency, resulting in anemia and neurological symptoms,andinsufficiency(orsubclinicaldeficiency),where symptoms are not well expressed but methylmalonic acidand/or homocysteine are often elevated, remains challenging. The4biochemicalmarkers—totalserumvitaminB-12,serum holotranscobalamin (HoloTC), plasma homocysteine, andmethylmalonic acid—can be used for the assessment of status, but knowledge of how age, sex, ethnicity, pregnancy, polymorphisms, renal function, microbiome, and drug useaffect these markers, independently of vitamin B-12 status, is essential for this assessment.It is now recognized that a c o m b i n a t i o no fa tl e a s t2o ft h e s em a r k e r si sp r e f e r a b l ew h e ndiagnosing patients.Serum vitamin B-12 and HoloTC are often used as first-line markers, followed by methylmalonic acid or homocysteine, if applicable ( 1).
Serum vitamin B- 12, with its typical cutoff for deficiency of <148 pmol/L ( 2), is still the most commonly used test but it is also the least sensitive. In vitamin B-12 insufficiency, serum vitamin B-12concentration extends upto ∼350pmol/L,which iscommon, occurringin ∼30%ofthepopulation( 3).Highconcentrations of serum vitamin B-12 do not always exclude deficiency and should prompt further investigations and treatment if the patient is clinically responsive ( 4,5).HoloTC, the biologically active form of vitamin B-12, is slightly more sensitive and offers a diagnostic advantage over serum vitamin B-12 in pregnancy and infancy, and is a useful test in the suspecteddiagnosis of transcobalamin and haptocorrin (vitamin B-12– binding proteins) deficiencies ( 1).Plasma homocysteine and methylmalonic acid are sensitive tests, but their use is lessreliable,particularlyinrenalimpairmentandhypothyroidism.
Additionally,deficienciesofriboflavin,vitaminB-6,andfolate elevate homocysteine concentrations, whereas gut microbiotaand alterations in fat metabolism may have an influence on methylmalonic acid ( 1). Overall, as there is no gold-standard testtodefinedeficiency,werecommendthatapositiveclinical response to vitamin B-12 treatment should be an important guidetothediagnosisofdeficiency.Apart from macrocytosis, which includes ineffective ery- thropoiesis, moderate hemolysis, and inefficient leukopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, vitamin B-12 deficiency may be associ-a t e dw i t h1o rm o r eo fal a r g en u m b e ro fs i g n s ,i np a r t i c u l a r relating to the nervous system, such as cognitive impairment, depression, stroke, brain atrophy, macular degeneration, im-paireddevelopmentinchildren,andneuraltubedefects( 3).
DietRecommendations The RDA values for the United States were based on the assumption that 50% of vitamin B-12 is absorbed from thedietandtheintakeswillmaintainnormalhematologicalvalues and serum vitamin B-12 within reference ranges. Therefore, 0.4 μg/d was recommended for infants aged 0–6 mo old and 0.5 μg/d for those aged 7–12 mo old.Intakes of 0.9, 1.2, 1.8, and2.4 μg/darerecommendedforindividualsaged1–3y,4–8 y,9–13y,and >18yold,respectively( 6).Higherrequirements were set for pregnancy (2.6 μg/d) and lactation (2.8 μg/d).Because of the high prevalence of food-bound malabsorption with increasing age, people >50 y old are recommended to consumefoodproductsfortifiedwithcrystallinevitaminB-12 as its absorption is not affected in this condition.
However, it remainsdebatableiftheaboveintakesaresufficienttoachieve optimum vitamin B-12 status, considering that they do not take into account vitamin B-12 insufficiency as well as themany factors that affect serum vitamin B-12 concentration independentlyofvitaminB-12intake.Followingasummation ofdailylossesthatneedtobecompensatedforbydietaryintakeof vitamin B-12, Doets et al. ( 7) estimated that vitamin B-12 intakesbetween3.8 μg/dand20.7 μg/dwouldbesufficientto preventdeficiency.FoodSources Vitamin B-12isonly madeinnatureby bacteria.Herbivorous animals acquire vitamin B-12 from their gastrointestinal tract, where vitamin B-12 is synthesized by bacteria andthen absorbed and incorporated into their tissues.However, omnivores and carnivores, including humans, do not have the ability to absorb bacterial vitamin B-12 from their largeintestine and are dependent on animal-source foods, which reach the small intestine.
Plants do not contain vitamin B-12 but some algae grow symbiotically with bacteria that producevitamin B-12. As such, it is extremely important that vegans andvegetariansensurethattheytakesupplementalvitaminB- 12, either in fortified foods or as tablets.Foods that are rich C⃝The Author(s) 2022.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition.All rights reserved.For permissions, plea se e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com .Adv Nutr 2022;13:2061–2063; doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmac030.2061 invitaminB-12includedairyproducts,meat(especiallyliver), eggs,fish,andshellfish.However,thebioavailabilityofvitamin B-12fromfoodsdiffersandvitaminB-12inmeatinparticularis not as available as that from dairy foods and fish/shellfish (8).The natural absorption of vitamin B-12 from food is a complex process and is saturated at ∼10μg/d (8), but intake fromcrystallinevitaminB-12mostlyoccursbydiffusion,with ∼1%ofthatconsumedbeingabsorbed.
ClinicalUses Many malabsorption and intestinal disorders lead to vitamin B-12 deficiency and require treatment. Pernicious anemia, anautoimmune gastritis in which parietal cell antibodies lead to the destruction of intrinsic factor needed for absorption and produced by parietal cells in the stomach, requires vitaminB-12 treatment for life.The prevalence of pernicious anemia is 0.1% in the general population, increasing to 1.9% in p e o p l eo v e rt h ea g eo f6 0y( 1).Hypochlorhydria, which is associated with atrophic gastritis and common in the elderly, impedes the release of vitamin B-12 from food.In Crohn’s and celiac disease, vitamin B-12 deficiency arises as a resultof reduced absorption due to villous atrophy and mucosal impairment,respectively.Inchronicpancreatitis,theenzymes required for the release of cobalamin from haptocorrin areimpaired.All of these conditions often require vitamin B- 12 therapy.

Toxicity Vitamin B-12 administered in supra-physiological doses,either orally or by intramuscular injections, has so far not been found to be toxic.However, more research is required to demonstrate that no unwanted adverse effects arise followinglarge doses of vitamin B-12 for a prolonged period of time.The formation of antibodies and immune complexes with vitamin B-12–binding proteins, leading to spuriously highserum vitamin B-12 or HoloTC concentrations but also to impaired vitamin B-12 absorption, have been reported ( 1,4).

The use of a combined indicator of vitaminB-12 status (cB12), a mathematical model combining all 4 vitaminB-12markers,hasbeenevaluatedinnumerousstudies andsomediagnosticsettings,showinganadditionaldiagnosticbenefit(1).Theappreciationoftheclinicalsignificanceofhigh serumvitaminB-12inpatientswhoarenotontreatmentledto the development of a screening strategy if unexplainable highconcentrations of vitamin B-12 are incidentally encountered (10). A value of 1000 pmol/L has been suggested as a cutoff for high serum vitamin B-12 concentrations if a patient isnottakingsupplements( 10).Loweringhomocysteine(baseline value >11 μmol/L) with B vitamins, including vitamin B- 12, has proven effective in slowing cognitive decline andbrain atrophy ( 3).
Although formal recommendations are required, the clinician should be especially alert to middle- aged and elderly patients with vitamin B-12 insufficiency inorder to slow cognitive decline and perhaps avert or delay dementia by implementing appropriate treatment ( 1,3).More evidencehasemergedfromworkinvestigatinghighfolateandlow vitamin B-12 interactions, and although the mechanisms leading to potential adverse effects (cognitive impairment, gestational diabetes, increased cancer risk, insulin resistance,interferencewithepilepsydrugs)havenotbeenelucidated,the findings from studies suggest that this interaction is genuine and needs to be urgently addressed. Vitamin B-12 statusdepletion by reduction in HoloTC concentration due to high folic acid intake was recently proposed as the mechanism for this interaction ( 11).
This is especially relevant in countries where mandatory folic acid fortification without vitamin B- 12fortificationhasbeenimplemented,andcountriesplanningto introduce such a policy. The use of natural folate (i.e., 5- methyltetrahydrofolate),asopposedtosyntheticfolicacid,has so far not been associated with adverse effects on vitamin B-12 status.Despite many research advances in further under- standing the complex absorption and metabolic processing of cobalamin,thepaceofimplementingvitaminB-12knowledgeinto clinical practice has been slow; thus, many physicians still solely rely on a serum vitamin B-12 test when diagnosing and treating patients.
Other pressing topics related to vitaminB-12 research that are currently being investigated include the understanding of the role of the microbiome and vitamin B-12 analogs on vitamin B-12 status, and their impact onmarkers of vitamin B-12 and elucidation of the mechanism of vitaminB-12crossingtheblood–brainbarrier.Abetterunder- standing of the impact of long-term vitamin B-12 injectionson vitamin B-12 status/markers is also warranted for future studies.
