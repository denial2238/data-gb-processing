The mitochondrial catabolism of valine, leucine, and isoleucine is a multistep pro - cess leading to the production of short-chain R-CoA species.
They can be subsequently exported from mitochondria as short-chain carnitines (SC-CARs), utilized in anabolic pathways, or released from the cells. Methods We examined the specificities of BCAA catabolism and cellular adaptation strategies to BCAA starva- tion in PDAC cells in vitro.We used metabolomics and lipidomics to quantify major metabolic changes in response to BCAA withdrawal.Using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry we quantified the fluorescence of BODIPY probe and the level of lipid droplets (LDs).We used BODIPY-conjugated palmitate to evaluate transport of fatty acids (FAs) into mitochondria.Also, we have developed a protocol for quantification of SC-CARs, BCAA-derived metabolites.Results Using metabolic profiling, we found that BCAA starvation leads to massive triglyceride (TG) synthesis and LD accumulation.This was associated with the suppression of activated FA transport into the mitochondrial matrix.
The suppression of FA import into mitochondria was rescued with the inhibitor of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and the activator of AMP kinase (AMPK), which both regulate carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1) activation status. Conclusions Our data suggest that BCAA catabolism is required for the import of long chain carnitines (LC-CARs) into mitochondria, whereas the disruption of this link results in the redirection of activated FAs into TG synthesis and its deposition into LDs.We propose that this mechanism protects cells against mitochondrial overload with LC- CARs and it might be part of the universal reaction to amino acid perturbations during cancer growth, regulating FA handling and storage.

Cancer & Metabolism (2024) 12:10 Introduction Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic tumors.Its incidence and attributable death rate have been increasing continu - ously over the last decades [1, 2].One-year mortality of PDAC patients is considerably high and it sparked inten - sive research on PDAC metabolism to identify meta - bolic pathways that could be targeted to prevent tumor development.Although enzymes of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) catabolic pathways are generally known, we still lack evidence regarding the catabolic fate of BCAAs in general, or specifically in cancer cells.
We currently acknowledge their role in transamination, com - plete oxidation (and utilization in the TCA cycle), and as metabolic precursors, i.e. BCAA-derived acetyl-CoA can be a precursor of cholesterol, and early BCAA-derived carnitines (BCAA-CARs) can participate in the syn - thesis of certain types of fatty acids (FAs) [3, 4].Besides this, BCAAs, mostly leucine, have been implicated in the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and consequent anabolic program under physiological and pathological conditions [5, 6].The interference of BCAA catabolism with other meta - bolic pathways is unexplored and the consequences of such crosstalk, especially at the level of short-chain car - nitines (SC-CARs), which originate from the respective R-CoAs [7] remain completely unknown.
Several works have focused also on the role of BCAA catabolism in PDAC growth, but it is not entirely clear how BCAA catabolism contributes to cancer develop - ment and to what extent. Using a KC and KPC genetic model, Carrer et al.2019 [8] showed that BCAAs are metabolized into acetyl-CoA, especially in the early stages of tumor development, i.e.PanIN lesions.Li et al.[9] demonstrated the role of mitochondrial branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2 (BCAT2) in PDAC develop - ment and showed that its genetic deletion decreased transamination activity and respiration [9], similarly to dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase E2 (DBT) knockdown [10].It was also demonstrated that BCAT2 in cancer cells reaminates branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs) supplied by cancer-associated fibroblasts into BCAAs.Lei et al.[11] showed that acetylation promotes BCAT2 degradation to suppress BCAA catabolism and pancreatic cancer growth.
On the other hand, the overex - pression of BCAT2 renders cells and xenografted tumors insensitive to ferroptosis induction by improving glu - tathione homeostasis [12]. In summary, several settings of BCAA utilization in PDAC have been described, but it is possible that the in situ situation adapts according to the actual nutrient and desmoplastic circumstances, and the whole-body substrate distribution.It is pertinent to presume that disturbances in the BCAAs supply or intake affect cellular behavior and possibly also cancer biology.For instance, mouse chow low in BCAAs delayed the development of PanIN in KC mice and PDAC progression in KPC mice [9].Moreover, diet containing high levels of BCAA promoted PanIN in KC mice owing to BCAT2 stabilization via USP1 deu - biquitinylase [13].At the moment, we cannot conclude whether any potential BCAA utilization in cancer cells is a matter of the essential nature of BCAAs in protein syn - thesis, or whether the effect is also metabolic.
To resolve this issue, we performed an in-depth analysis of BCAA metabolism in PDAC cultured cells. We report here that a lack of BCAAs can trigger adaptive responses similar to cellular starvation programs, leading to lipid droplet (LD) accumulation.Thus, we describe a novel mechanism of FA redirection towards neutral lipid synthesis, which also affects mitochondrial bioenergetics.In our model, BCAAs are involved in the regulation of mitochondrial capacity to oxidize FAs by β-oxidation, probably via car - nitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1).Moreover, our work implies the role of SC-CARs derived from BCAAs as mediators of downstream metabolic remodeling after nutrient exhaustion.Materials and methods Cell cultures In this study, we used commonly used human cultured cancer cell lines PaTu 8902, MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1, the authenticity of which was confirmed by STR profil - ing (Baria, Czech Republic).
Cells were grown in 1×RPMI w/o phenol red containing 10% FBS (Biosera), 1.5 g·L−1 of NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES, 1×penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 mM glucose, 1 mM glutamine, and optionally 200 µM of valine, leucine, and isoleu - cine (each). Treatment under -BCAA conditions was for 48–72 h according to the requirements of the experi - ment, i.e.72 h for cell viability testing and 48 h for other experiments.As a rule, the medium was replaced with a fresh one a day before the experiment.Analytical methods For the analysis of BCAA-derived carnitine species, we optimized the LC-MS based method in collabora - tion with the metabolomics facility at the Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry at the BIOCEV Research Center; Faculty of Science, Charles University.106 cells were used as a starting point.Cell pellets were washed with 137 mM NaCl and 2.7 mM KCl, and subsequently resuspended in a buffer containing 40% acetonitrile, 40% methanol, and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in distilled water.
Samples were incubated and shaken for 20 min on ice, centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000× g, and the Page 3 of 18 Gotvaldová et al. Cancer & Metabolism (2024) 12:10 supernatants were evaporated and resuspended in 40 µl of 10% acetonitrile containing 1 µg/ml indole- 2,4,5,6,7-d5-3-acetic acid (CDN Isotopes) as the inter - nal standard.The sample volume for injection was 5 µl.Samples were analyzed in a Dionex Ultimate 3000RS liquid chromatography system coupled to a TSQ Quan - tiva mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific) using an ESI source in positive mode with the following ion source parameters: ion transfer tube temperature 325 °C, vaporizer temperature 350 °C, spray voltage 3500 V, sheath gas 50, and aux gas 10.A Luna Omega PS C18 (150 × 2.1 mm, 3 μm, 100 Å) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used for the separation of analytes.The column was maintained at 35 °C.
The buffer composi - tion was A: 10 mM ammonium formate in water, 0.1% F.A, 0.01% heptafluorobutyric acid; B: 99.8% methanol, and the flow rate was 0.3 ml/min and total run time was 24 min. The elution gradient (A/B) started at 0–2 min: 100% A; 3–9 min: 85% A; 9.5–14 min: 65% A; followed by a washing phase 14.1–17 min: 0% A, and equili - bration phase 17.1–24 min: 100% A.Selective reac - tion monitoring (SRM) was used for the detection and quantification of selected compounds.Data were pro - cessed in the Skyline software.For the targeted metabolomics of TCA and mitochon - drial metabolites, we used previously reported GC-MS based methods.Cells were rinsed with PBS, trypsinized, counted, snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C until analysis.At least 106 cells per sample were used.Cell metabolites 2OG (347.3), fumarate (245.2), malate (335.3), and citrate (273.2) were measured using a method reported previ - ously [14, 15].
In addition, the analytes succinate (247.2), aspartate (232.2), alanine (190.1), and glutamate (246.2) were considered in this method based on the molecular ions (in brackets) found in the NIST mass spectral library specific for EI ionization. DL-malic acid-2,3,3-d3 (338.3, 10 µl of 100 µg/ml) was used as the internal standard.The total analysis time was 10 min.For lipidomics and metabolomics, cells were grown on 6-well plates and treated as required, quickly washed with PBS, snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C.Metabolites were extracted using a biphasic solvent system of cold metha - nol, methyl tert-butyl ether, and water [16].An aliquot of the bottom (polar) phase was collected, cleaned up using an acetonitrile/isopropanol mixture, and after evapo - ration, the dry extract was resuspended in 5% metha - nol with 0.2% formic acid followed by separation in an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column (Waters).
Another aliquot of the bottom phase was evaporated, resuspended in an acetonitrile/water mixture, and separated in an Acquity UPLC BEH Amide column. Metabolites were detected in negative and positive electrospray ion mode (Thermo Q Exactive Plus instrumentation) [17].Signal intensities were normalized to the respective total ion count (TIC) before subsequent statistical analysis.TIC-normalized intensities are provided in Supplementary Material 2.Flow cytometry Cells were seeded on 12-well plates 72 h prior to the experiment.BCKA and CHS-FBS were added 48 h before analysis, while other treatments (DGAT1i, DGAT2i, 3-MA) were added o/n, or for 3 h prior analysis (BafA, CQ).Cells were stained with 500 nM BODIPY™ 493/503 (ThermoFisher Scientific) in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS, and harvested by trypsi - nization.
Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS contain - ing 0.5 mM EDTA, stained with HOECHST 33258 (18 µM, MERCK), and fluorescence intensity was measured using a BD LSRII flow cytometer with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 500–550 nm. The FITC-A fluo - rescence intensities of BODIPY™ 493/503 of each live cell (HOECHST 33258-negative) were analyzed using the FlowJo software (LLC) and expressed as median fluorescence intensity, which were integrated into the final graphs.Real‑time PCR RNA was isolated from fresh cells using a Total RNA Purification Kit (Jena Bioscience), followed by reverse transcription using a TATAA GrandScript cDNA Synthe - sis Kit (TATAA Biocenter).Q-PCR was performed using Forget-Me-Not EvaGreen qPCR Master Mix (Biotium) and a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR System (BioRad).Calculated crossing points were used to calculate ∆∆Ct values (compared to control cells).Primer sequences are summarized in Table S1 in Supplementary Material 1.
Western blotting Cells were lysed in a cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris- HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluo - ride (PMSF), 1% protease inhibitor cocktail for 30 min on ice. The lysates were then centrifuged at 6,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C.10–50 µg of protein was separated through 8–12% SDS-PAGE gel.SDS-PAGE electropho - resis was carried out at 75 V for 30 min, followed by 150 V for 60 min.Proteins separated in SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using a tank transfer system conducted at 300 mA for 75 min.Subsequently, following the man - ufacturer’s recommendations for specific antibodies, PVDF membranes were blocked, rinsed, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies.Finally, pro - teins were detected using chemiluminescence method with the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad).Page 4 of 18 Gotvaldová et al.
Cancer & Metabolism (2024) 12:10 Viability Cells were plated on 96-well plates to a density of 5,000–10,000 cells per well. 24-hours post-seeding, medium was changed and inhibitors added.After another 72 h, neutral-red assay was performed [18].Respirometry High-resolution respirometry (HRR) was applied with intact cells using a coupling control protocol (CCP) and O2k-respirometer (Oroboros Instruments, Austria), as reported previously [19].Cells were measured in the respective growth medium.For the β-oxidation of intact cells, the CCP protocol was used, but cells were resus - pended in a growth medium containing 1% FBS.Preparation of BSA‑palmitate conjugate Palmitate conjugated with BSA was prepared as follows.First, a 0.17 mM solution of Albumin Bovine Fraction V, Protease and Fatty Acid-Free (Serva, Serving Scien - tists) was prepared in 150 mM NaCl and stirred until BSA dissolved at 37 °C.Then 1 mM sodium palmitate was prepared into 150 mM NaCl solution by stirring at 70 °C.
The solutions were gradually combined with stir - ring, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a bath, then buffered to pH 7.4 and made up to a final volume of 1 mM pal - mitate: 0.17 mM BSA. For respiration measurements, this 5×solution was diluted with 2×RPMI medium to a final ratio of 200 µM palmitate: 34 µM BSA and cells were incubated o/n.Confocal microscopy Cells were cultured for 3 days to 70–80% cell confluency on quartz coverslips coated with poly-l -lysine.The cells were then stained with 500 nM BODIPY™ 493/503 (Ther - moFisher Scientific) along with 1 µM HOECHST 33258 for 15 min at 37 °C.Alternatively, for mitochondrial import experiments, cells were stained with 500 nM BODIPY™ FL C16 (ThermoFisher Scientific) in the cultivation medium o/n and subsequently stained with 500 nM MitotrackerRed™ for 15 min at 37 °C.
The coverslips were washed twice in a PBS buffer and then placed in a thermostable chamber supplied with 5% CO2 and measured by confocal micros - copy (Leica TSC SP8 AOBS WLL MP) in the regular cul - tivation medium. An HC PL APO 63× /1.20 NA W CORR CS2, WD = 0.3 mm objective was used for observation with argon laser excitation (488 nm) for both BODIPY dyes (BODIPY™ 493/503, and BODIPY™ FL C16) with a 500– 550 nm emission filter.For MitotrackerRed (581⁄644), we used a WLL laser with excitation at 581 nm and emission of 620–660 nm.An argon laser with excitation at 405 nm and emission filter of 415–480 nm was used for HOECHST 33258.The results were evaluated using the Fiji ImageJ soft - ware as mean of BODIPY 493/503 fluorescence related to HOECHST 33342 (%).Statistical analysis All data represented as bar plots are expressed as means and standard deviations (SD).Whisker plots are depicted from minimum to maximum values.

Similarly to glucose and glutamine starvation, BCAA depletion (-BCAA) inhib - its the cell growth and cell survival of all three tested cell lines (Fig. 1a), but the effect was not additive with glu - tamine or glucose removal (not shown).To address the question of whether BCAAs are oxidative substrates that contribute to TCA cycle turnover, we measured the respiration parameters of three cancer cell lines under BCAA-depleted conditions.BCAA starvation led to a decrease in respiratory rate, basal (Fig.1b) and maximum (Fig.S1a), in all three PDAC-derived cell lines, except for MIA PaCa-2 at maximal respiration.Elevated respiration and TCA cycle intermediates in glucose-starving cells can be attributed to partial derepression of Warburg and Crabtree effects [22].The BCAA depletion resulted in a slight decrease in TCA intermediates, but not in the level of free amino acids involved in mitochondrial transami - nation reactions, i.e.alanine, glutamate, and aspartate (Fig.1c).
Neither mitochondrial network shape (Fig. S1c), nor expression of mitochondrial proteins specific for dis - tinct sub-compartments (BCKDHA, BCAT2, TIM23, ATP5A, PDH, P-PDH, GLS1; Fig.S1d) was affected under BCAA starvation, but we were able to detect some downregulation in the expression of BCAA cat - abolizing genes (Fig.S1b).At this point, we cannot con - clude whether BCAAs are completely oxidized in PDAC cultured cells in vitro or whether they support other pathways oxidizing substrates in mitochondria, caus - ing respiration decrease.Because we have verified that Page 6 of 18 Gotvaldová et al.Cancer & Metabolism (2024) 12:10 PDAC cells in BCAA-depleted conditions are viable and consume oxygen by respiration, we consider those condi - tions as a valid model for the subsequent experiments.
BCAA‑free conditions induce metabolic changes in mitochondrial and extra‑mitochondrial pathways Aside from a role in oxidation or transamination, BCAA catabolism is implicated in the synthesis of odd-chain and branched-chain FAs in adipose tissue [3, 4], FAs, tri - glycerides (TGs) [23], and cholesterol [8] in PDAC. We asked whether these metabolic pathways are affected by the absence of BCAAs in PDAC.To analyze the meta - bolic remodeling related to BCAA depletion in a com - plex way, we performed metabolomics and lipidomics analyses of extracts from cells treated under BCAA- depleted conditions and searched for common features between the cell lines.First, multivariate analyses of polar and non-polar analytes resulted in the stratifica - tion of -BCAA and +BCAA groups in the principal component 3 (PC3, t3) (Fig.2a).
The metabolites related to PC3 are presented in the loadings plot and include analytes of metabolic pathways TGs, ether-linked TGs (TGs-O), cholesteryl-esters (CEs), and free amino acids, while among the downregulated metabolites there were downstream metabolites of BCAA catabolism, includ - ing SC-CARs and BCAA-CARs. Changes in those path - ways were also identified by univariate analyses and highlighted in volcano plots (Fig.2b).SC-CARs (includ - ing BCAA-CARs) are synthesized from their respective R-CoA intermediates produced in the BCAA catabolic pathway by mitochondrial carnitine O-acetyltransferase (CRAT, EC 2.3.1.7) and represent precursors for ana - bolic functions of BCAAs as previously demonstrated [3, 4].Lipids most significantly and consistently affected by BCAA starvation were TGs (p < 0.001, 5.24⨉, 3.22⨉, and 1.54⨉ for PaTu 8902, MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1, respec - tively; Fig.S2).
The formation of lipid droplets and autophagy is upregulated under BCAA‑depleted conditions We further attempted to explain mechanisms that lead to a build-up of TGs in response to BCAA depletion. To confirm and extend lipidomics data, we used the stain - ing of TGs with the fluorescent probe BODIPY™ 493/503 (BODIPY further on) using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.Imaging experiments showed a build-up of LDs in -BCAA cells, especially in MIA PaCa-2 and PaTu 8902 (Fig.3a, b, S3b).Interestingly, the carnitine palmi - toyltransferase 1A (CPT1) inhibitor etomoxir (ETO) also caused LD accumulation, suggesting that we were observing the redirection of the FA pool away from mito - chondria and toward TG synthesis.Indeed, the inhibi - tion of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), one of the enzymes catalyzing the final step of TG synthe - sis, led to downregulated LD formation in MIA PaCa-2 and PaTu 8902 (Fig.3b, c, S4e), as quantified by flow cytometry (Fig.S3a).
DGAT2 inhibition was ineffective to block LD formation, though.

Cancer & Metabolism (2024) 12:10 into the cells by treatment with charcoal-stripped serum (CHS-FBS) for 48 h did not lead to a significant decrease in LD formation compared to the -BCAA treatment, suggesting that TGs are synthesized from endogenous FAs.Hence, we inhibited autophagosome formation by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and autolysosome forma - tion by bafilomycin A (BafA) and chloroquine (CQ) in order to decrease the availability of FAs originating from degraded membranes [24].3-MA, BafA, and CQ effec - tively decreased BODIPY fluorescence in -BCAA but not Fig.2 BCAA starvation induces metabolic remodeling.a Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) scores plot (left) depicting the stratification of samples based on the presence/absence of BCAAs in PC3 (t3).

Page 9 of 18 Gotvaldová et al.Cancer & Metabolism (2024) 12:10 in +BCAA samples, indicating that autophagy occurs during BCAA starvation, and contributes to LD build-up by releasing FAs.BCAA starvation, therefore, resembles the other previously reported model of nutrient star - vation (Hanks balanced salt solution, HBSS) [25–27].
Almost no changes in gene expression of enzymes cata - lyzing LD formation were observed in BCAA-depleted PDAC cells (Supplementary Fig. S3c).We conclude that BCAA depletion induces TG synthesis via a DGAT1- dependent pathway, and that autophagy is initiated, as demonstrated using treatment with autophagy inhibitors.Importantly, BCKA supplementation stalled LD forma - tion under BCAA-free conditions, which suggests that BCAA-derived metabolites and BCAA catabolism, but not the BCAAs itself, imply the effect of TG accumula - tion (Fig.3b, S3b).Import of FAs into mitochondria from the cytosol is inhibited in BCAA‑free conditions Previous works reported the delivery of lipolysis-derived FA import into mitochondria in starvation models [26, 28, 29], so we asked whether BCAA levels interfere with the dynamics of FA activation and its subsequent stor - age vs.oxidation.
To determine the functional conse - quences of BCAA-FA interplay, we used high-resolution respirometry in order to estimate β-oxidation stimulated by BSA-palmitate in the presence and absence of BCAAs. The inability to deliver of LC-CARs into the matrix space would result in the lower respiratory rate.The shortcom - ing of this approach is that the respiration stimulated by BSA-palmitate is not usually recognized in the routine state, but clear differences can be expected in the maxi - mum respiratory rates (see scheme related to “Palmi - tate oxidation stress test kit” by Agilent Technologies).Indeed, maximum respiration after the addition of FA 16:0 was lower in BCAA-starved cells, and ETO treat - ment was able to inhibit respiration to a larger extent in BCAA-containing medium (Fig.4a, S4a).
This experi - ment suggests that LC-CARs reach the mitochondrial matrix at a lower rate in BCAA-starved cells, and that β-oxidation is functionally intact in control cells.To further elaborate on our hypothesis, we used fluo - rescent FA conjugate (BODIPY FL C16, C16-BODIPY from here on) and traced its cellular fate. As expected, treatment with ETO led to the deposition of FA con - jugate into LDs (Fig.4b).Vice versa, treatment with DGAT1i induced the import of fluorescent palmitate into mitochondria.However, the import into mitochondria was considerably mitigated in BCAA-depleted condi - tions, and it was rescued by BCKA or BCAA supplemen - tation (as elaborated in the next chapter).Both imaging and bioenergetics data consistently show the defect in mitochondrial delivery of FA intermediates in BCAA- depleted conditions.
A reduced C16-BODIPY staining of the mitochondrial reticulum suggests the inhibition of the CPT1 and/or carnitine-acylcarnitine transferase (CACT) but not inhibited β-oxidation or carnitine palmi - toyl transferase 2 (CPT2). To support the conclusions of imaging data, we per - formed a lipidomics profiling of MIA PaCa-2 cells cul - tivated in +BCAA and -BCAA conditions treated with DGATi and ETO.We expected that the suppression of CPT1 function would result in LC-CAR decline, while suppression of β-oxidation or CACT [30] would result in accumulated LC-CAR (Fig.S4b).First, treatment with DGAT1i induced a considerable amount of LC-CARs and FAs (Fig.4c), although only FA levels were higher in BCAA-starved relative to BCAA-supplied cells treated with DGAT1i (Fig.S4d).As proof-of-concept, we also treated cells with ETO and observed a massive down - regulation in LC-CARs along with upregulation of FAs and TGs (Fig.4c, S4e).
Likewise, BCAA depletion also resulted in low LC-CAR levels and high FA levels, which was effectively rescued by BCKA addition. It is also worth noting that CPT1 inhibition leads to the accumulation of TGs with higher molecular weight (54 carbons and more, Fig.S4e), while BCAA shortage, interestingly, led to a uniform change in the number of carbons and the level of saturation.Based on the imaging and bioenergetics evaluations, we conclude that BCAA starvation compromises the transport of LC-CARs into the mitochondrial matrix via CPT1 and/or CACT inhibition, hence the pool of (See figure on next page.)

Cancer & Metabolism (2024) 12:10 activated FA (R-CoA) would be redirected into TG syn - thesis. However, considering the LC-CAR decline and the diminished mitochondrial targeting of C16-BODIPY in BCAA starvation, we favor the possibility that CPT1 rather than CACT inhibition contributes to LD build-up.BCAA‑derived short‑chain acylcarnitines link mitochondrial BCAA metabolism and TG metabolism Next, we intended to confirm the shortage of BCAA- CARs under -BCAA conditions.Alternatively, there could be other metabolites that are decreased under the -BCAA conditions and which regulate LC-CAR import into mitochondria.In the PLS-DA analysis (Fig.2a, b), the stratification of TG and BCAA/BCKA species in the PC3 extremities implies that there is a negative correla - tion between BCAA and TG metabolism.
Therefore, we performed a correlation analysis of TGs with all individ - ual metabolites/lipids available in our data set, calculated Pearson coefficients, and searched for negative correla - tions, because the supplementation of such metabolites should theoretically rescue the import of C16-BODIPY under the BCAA-depleted conditions. To analyze the rescue effect of the tested compounds on SC-CAR levels, we optimized the LC-MS-based method for the detection of BCAA-CARs, namely isovaleryl, isobutyryl, 2-meth - ylburytyl, tigloyl, and downstream species propionyl, and acetyl-carnitine.The method is able to distinguish between isomers of butyryl/isobutyryl carnitines, and valeryl/isovaleryl carnitines.We confirmed the down - regulation of BCAA-CARs during BCAA starvation, except for acetyl-carnitine (Fig.5a), which is not exclu - sively specific for BCAA catabolism.Interestingly, lev - els of butyryl and valeryl-CAR, products of β-oxidation, were not changed.
Levels of BCAA-CARs were rescued by BCKAs and carnitine treatment (Fig. 5b), but not with acetate, methyl-pyruvate, pantothenic acid, or dimethyl 2-oxoglutarate (metabolites negatively correlated with TG).Similarly, BCKAs rescued C16-BODIPY import into mitochondria with -BCAA treatment, as did free car - nitine and BCAA treatment overnight (Fig.5c), but not pantothenic acid and dimethyl 2-oxoglutarate (Fig.S5).These data confirm that the oxidation of BCAAs in mito - chondria results in the formation of the typical SC-CAR species and that their decrease during BCAA starvation can be rescued by BCKAs.Acetyl‑CoA carboxylase regulates BCAA starvation‑induced LD formation LD accumulation has been observed previously in response to starvation and the activation of autophagy flux, ER stress, and dysregulation of mTORC1 [25, 27, 31, 32].Another conserved mechanism of handling metabolic fluxes during a substrate starvation is AMPK signaling [33–35].
One AMPK target is the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the product of which is malonyl-CoA, an effective inhibitor of CPT1 [34]. The phosphoryla - tion of ACC by activated AMPK suppresses its activity, which leads to downregulation of malonyl-CoA levels and to release of potential CPT1 inhibition.To test the impact of ACC activity on BCAA starvation-induced LD formation, we assayed BODIPY fluorescence after treat - ment with ACC inhibitor (TOFA, ACCi).We observed a substantial decrease in BODIPY fluorescence in BCAA- depleted conditions (Fig.6a, c), confirming that CPT1 inhibition contributes to the formation of LDs in the absence of BCAAs.Next, we have tested AMPK phos - phorylation status (i.e.activation status) and observed that AMPK phosphorylation is suppressed in BCAA- starving cells (Figs.6b, S6b).We have subsequently quan - tified BODIPY fluorescence using ACCi, AMPK activator AICAR, and AMPK inhibitor Compound C (Comp C).
In BCAA-depleted conditions AICAR suppressed LDs to control levels. In contrary, Comp C induced BODIPY flu - orescence in control cells but not in BCAA-starving cells (Fig.6c).Moreover, ACCi and AICAR inhibited LD stain - ing from C16-BODIPY in favor of mitochondrial import, both in BCAA-enriched and also in BCAA-starved cells (Fig.6d), while Comp C completely halted the import of C16-BODIPY into mitochondria.To verify that this activation/inhibition axis is valid in our cell system, we starved cells of glucose and glutamine and verified C16- BODIPY import (Fig.S6a).As expected, the withdrawal of glucose led to the import of fluorescent dye into mito - chondria, while glutamine starvation resulted in LD formation and a minimal import of C16-BODIPY into mitochondria.These data demonstrate that mitochon - drial import of FAs is inhibited in BCAA-starving cells due to changes of ACC and AMPK activities.
TG synthesis protects against detrimental effects of LC‑CAR overload in mitochondria Further, we asked whether LD formation is part of the adaptive phenotype that helps cells to survive BCAA starvation. It is generally accepted that TG synthesis might neutralize the potentially toxic effects of non- esterified FAs in the cytosol, particularly polyunsatu - rated FAs (PUFAs), which are prone to oxidation and can cause cellular lipotoxicity [36– 38].Indeed, PUFA levels were elevated to a different extent in BCAA- starved cells, especially in MIA PaCa-2 cells (Fig.S7 a).FAs esterified within the TG pool were also consider - ably less saturated(Fig.S7 b).If TG synthesis neutralizes potential lipotoxicity, the inhibition of DGAT1 would be more harmful in cells exhausted of BCAAs.On the other hand, the report of Nguyen et al [25] implied that DGAT1-induced toxicity in starving cells results from Page 12 of 18 Gotvaldová et al.Cancer & Metabolism (2024) 12:10 Fig.

The inhibition of TG synthesis was sig - nificantly more detrimental to cells with BCAAs in the media, in which LD build-up is less apparent (Fig. 7a).It appears that the induced formation of LDs in the absence of BCAAs is a consequence of hindered FA import into mitochondria, but not a response to cyto - solic lipotoxicity.Moreover, BCAA-starved cells are less sensitive to ACCi treatment (induction of mitochon - drial FA import), perhaps because of lower FA load in the mitochondria prior treatment, as also suggested by Nguyen et al.[25].The inhibition of LD formation with DGAT1i is sup - posed to redirect FAs into mitochondria, which causes mitochondrial lipotoxicity, which, in turn, can be pre - vented in the absence of BCAAs or glutamine.To validate this idea, we examined whether halting the inhibition of CPT1 would sensitize cells to DGAT1 inhibition.ACCi rescued the import of C16-BODIPY into mitochondria in BCAA-starved cells (Fig.6d).
The negative effect of ACCi in combination with DGAT1i was more apparent in glu - cose-starved cells or cells in complete medium, but the additive effect was clear in all tested cell lines (Fig. 7b).Hence, the inhibited import of LC-CARs into mitochon - dria in cells that are starved of glutamine or BCAAs has a protective effect compared to cells able to import FAs readily.This line of evidence indicates that inhibition of LD formation and enforcing the import of activated FAs into mitochondria is potentially harmful in terms of cell viability, and that the level of detrimental effect is dependent on the pre-existing mitochondrial load of imported FAs.In summary, we demonstrated that both mitochon - dria and LDs serve as a buffering compartment of FAs released during autophagy.As a consequence of inhibited TG synthesis, the free FAs are transported into mito - chondria, which causes concomitant cytotoxicity.
Lack of certain oxidative substrates, such as valine, leucine, isole - ucine, or glutamine, however, is able to inhibit FA import into mitochondria, potentially via the AMPK-ACC-CPT1 axis and protects against the lipotoxic dysfunction of mitochondria. Discussion Systemic BCAA fluctuations accompany PDAC progres - sion, and also the development of cancer cachexia asso - ciated with PDAC [39].The importance of BCAAs for PDAC tumor growth is still unclear; there are studies showing both increased and negligible metabolic utiliza - tion of BCAAs by PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo [8–10, 12, 13, 23, 40].Therefore, we analyzed the interaction of BCAA metabolism with other metabolic pathways and demonstrated that BCAA starvation of PDAC-derived cells results in enhanced TG synthesis and LD biogen - esis, probably as a consequence of ongoing autophagy, generating FAs.
LD formation in non-adipose tissues represents a strategy to avoid FA excess in the cytosol after various metabolic cues, while lipolysis followed by β-oxidation is a primary mechanism for utilizing FAs released from TGs. Here, we discuss that the down - regulated import of LC-CARs into mitochondria in the absence of BCAAs also contributes to LD biogenesis.To estimate the metabolic function of BCAAs, we assessed bioenergetics and metabolomics features of three cell lines derived from human PDAC with various genetic backgrounds.Surprisingly, we found that BCAA depletion leads to TG synthesis and to a lower extent also CEs, which results in LD accumulation (Figs.2a, b and 3a, b).This is in contrast to observations reported for the heart muscle, where TG pool was diminished after BCAA-restricted chow diet in Zucker fatty rats [41].
Nev - ertheless, our model can be considered as an alternative to amino acid starvation at the cellular level, which was shown to trigger the consumption of cellular membranes and subsequent LD biogenesis [25, 26]. Even though we did not inspect details of autophagy initiation under BCAA depletion, our data imply that BCAA starvation itself is capable to trigger autophagy, similarly to HBSS treatment [25, 26].The induction of autophagy in PDAC cells was also described in response to glutamine or glu - cose removal [42, 43].The innovation of our work stems from the experimental evidence demonstrating that DGAT1-dependent TG synthesis in BCAA-depleted cells is a consequence of the impaired delivery of activated (See figure on next page.)

Page 15 of 18 Gotvaldová et al.Cancer & Metabolism (2024) 12:10 FAs into mitochondria, and its redirection into anabolic reactions.Using a series of approaches, we have demon - strated the reciprocity between FA utilization in mito - chondria and FA storage in the TG pool, and vice versa (Figs.4b, c, S4e).Thus, compared to previous reports, our study reveals a novel cellular mechanism leading to LD accumulation, i.e.inhibited import of cytosolic FAs into mitochondria, which leads to LD biogenesis.
To explain this phenomenon, we contemplated three mechanisms that would lead to the uncoupled FA import into mitochondria, i.e. the inhibition of CPT1, inhibition of CACT by the lack of BCAA-derived carnitines, and inhibition of ꞵ -oxidation in mitochondria (Fig.S4 b).Sev - eral causalities point to the CPT1 inhibition under BCAA deficiency, such as; (i) the lack of mitochondrial targeting of C16-BODIPY, (ii) a decline of LC-CAR instead of the accumulation, and (iii) responsiveness to ACC inhibi - tor TOFA as the only agent able to rescue mitochondrial targeting of C16-BODIPY.TG synthesis associated with CPT1 inhibition was also demonstrated in several in vitro cell models, including PANC-1 cells [44].On the other hand, using the model of actinic keratosis and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, it has been demonstrated that CACT inhibition results in LC-CAR build-up [30].Impor - tantly, a negative correlation of LC-CARs and TGs has been noticed by others [45, 46].
This supports our conclu - sion regarding CPT1 inhibition rather than CACT inhibi - tion in BCAA starvation (see model situations depicted in Fig. S4 b).As for the mechanism of CPT1 inactivation, we presume that CPT1 might be inhibited via malonyl-CoA synthesized by ACC, which is a conserved pathway of CPT1 activity regulation [33– 35].For instance, under glu - cose starvation AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits ACC, which leads to the release of CPT1 inhibition and the metabolic switch to FA oxidation [33].In our case, glucose removal also readily promoted FA import into mitochon - dria (Fig.S6 a).In contrast, TOFA, an inhibitor of ACC, restored the mitochondrial import of FAs (Fig.6d), as well as AMPK inhibitor AICAR, which is in line with our hypothesis of CPT1 inhibition via AMPK signaling under BCAA depletion.Apart from TOFA and AICAR, the res - toration of mitochondrial import was only achieved with BCKAs and partially also free carnitine.
We are, however, aware that the resolution of confocal microscopy does not allow us to definitely distinguish between mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) or matrix targeting of C16- BODIPY (Fig. 4b).Despite our argumentations being considered preliminary due to the use of pharmacological inhibitors and in vitro nature of our study, we were able to confirm several steps of the cascade that point to CPT1 inhibition, including the decreased AMPK phosphoryla - tion during BCAA depletion (Fig.6b).Further genetic manipulations are needed to further elaborate on the exact mechanism of inhibited FA import into mitochon - dria during BCAA depletion.Subsequently, we asked what the benefit would be of restraining FA import into mitochondria under BCAA starvation.Our data support the hypothesis that non- lipolysis-derived FA import into mitochondria is poten - tially detrimental to mitochondrial function [25, 45].
In our case, the inhibition of DGAT1 was more harmful to cells that were able to import FAs into mitochondria, Fig. 7 Import of FAs into mitochondria negatively affects cell viability.a Cell viability of MIA PaCa-2 cells treated 72 h with DGAT1i, DGAT2i, and ACCi in BCAA-containing or deficient medium.Values are percent of respective control with no addition of pharmacological inhibitor.One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.N > 3, n > 12.Criteria of significance: ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.b Cell viability of MIA PaCa-2 treated with DGAT1i, DGAT1i + ACCi and DGAT1i + carnitine in complete medium, no glutamine, no glucose, and BCAA-depleted cells (-BCAA).Values are percent of respective control with no addition of pharmacological inhibitor.One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.N > 3, n > 20.Criteria of significance: ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 Page 16 of 18 Gotvaldová et al.Cancer & Metabolism (2024) 12:10 i.e.
BCAA-supplemented cells with or without glu - cose, and it was less harmful to cells that were not able to import FAs into mitochondria, i.e. BCAA- and glu - tamine-starved cells.We might speculate that LC-CARs imported into mitochondria exceed the capacity of ꞵ-oxidation, so the protective phenotype against DGATi in BCAA-starving cells stems from the low import of LC-CARs in the mitochondria rather than the ability to maintain LDs.Accordingly, the activation of FA import in BCAA-depleted cells with ACCi (TOFA) treatment also decreased cell viability.In light of this, LDs in non- adipose tissues might serve as buffering compartments, which sequester free cytosolic FAs that are not imported into mitochondria.On the other hand, it has been sug - gested that the pool of FAs released from TGs by lipolysis is directed into mitochondria without any specific toxic - ity [26].
All these observations suggest that promoting a direct mitochondrial FA uptake after DGAT1 inhibition exceeds the capacity of β-oxidation to process LC-CARs, which negatively affects cell viability. Therefore, LDs can be considered to be a transient cellular compartment that regulates the FA pool in the cytosol and its distribution in the cell and mitochondria.There is, however, also a controversy regarding the role of BCAA-CARs in our model system.We attempted to demonstrate that catabolic products of BCAAs might represent an actual mechanistic link to FA import into mitochondria and subsequent TG accumulation.The rea - soning behind the hypothesis is that BCAA-CARs might be involved in the CACT-mediated exchange of LC- CARs as opposed to free carnitine.In principle, BCAAs are catabolized into SC-CoAs, which are further oxidized or acted on by the enzyme termed CRAT.
The primary function of CRAT is to avert R-CoA accumulation by producing BCAA-CAR and SC-CAR intermediates, which can be exported from mitochondria [7, 47]. We are intrigued by the question whether the lack of these BCAA-derived SC-CARs is the primary cause of stalled LC-CAR import into mitochondria and if their dysbal - ance could initiate a chain of events leading to CPT1 inhibition and TG accumulation.Importantly, there is a report by Long et al., which demonstrated a negative correlation of TG accumulation with BCAA-derived carnitines after iron depletion by deferiprone [48], sug - gesting that the SC-CAR equilibrium can be disturbed by mechanisms other than BCAA starvation.
The link of BCAA-related mitochondrial carnitines and TG synthe - sis deserves further investigation, ideally in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction, because there is accumu - lating evidence that enhanced TG synthesis and LD bio - genesis correlate with mitochondria-related disturbances [26, 49–51].Asking whether BCAA species are actually the oxida - tive substrates in PDAC cells, we favor the interpreta - tion that BCAA metabolism supports ꞵ-oxidation via the import of FAs into mitochondria. We did not detect any solid signal of stable isotope labeled (13C) valine and leucine in TCA metabolites (not shown), which is in line with [40].Besides the decreased respiratory rate and decreased TCA cycle intermediates, we did not observe any consistent changes in mitochondrial markers, sug - gesting that mitochondrial biogenesis is not affected by BCAA starvation.The oxidation of palmitate was decreased in BCAA-depleted cells (Figs.
4a, S4a); how - ever, our experiments cannot show whether the capacity of ꞵ-oxidation was diminished, or whether its substrate levels are compromised due to decreased import. We are, however, aware of the obvious ambiguity of such an interpretation, but are unable to confirm our hypotheses using available approaches and methods.The limitation of our study is that we have failed to show the detailed molecular mechanism that would link the FA import to BCAA oxidation products.Also, based on the available data, we cannot conclude whether the proposed mechanism is unique for BCAA starvation, or if it represents a general pathway of substrate redistribu - tion in response to autophagy.Additionally, the role of BCAA-derived carnitines and the role of AMPK-ACC axis in CPT1 inhibition deserve further exploration.Future research using genetic approaches could reveal the respective physiological and pathological applicabil - ity.
Our study, however, is relevant to substrate variations that have been demonstrated during PDAC progression [39]. Conclusions In summary, we have presented the novel aspect of BCAA catabolism in terms of interactions with other mitochondrial and extramitochondrial pathways, both anabolic and catabolic, and provided a novel insight into the mitochondrial-cytosolic crosstalk mediated by metabolic signaling.In our study, BCAA starvation is manifested as LD accumulation, resulting from altered dynamics of FA distribution between oxidation and stor - age.Mechanistically, the studied phenotype stems from the inhibited import of LC-CARs into mitochondria, most probably due to the diminished AMPK signal - ing, which leads to ACC activation and the downstream inhibition of CPT1.Activated FAs are subsequently redi - rected into TG synthesis and sequestered in LDs.
We conclude that a decreased consumption of BCAAs can regulate the flux of FAs into β-oxidation and protects against mitochondrial substrate overload. Page 17 of 18 Gotvaldová et al.
