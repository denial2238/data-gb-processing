Therefore, the applications of herbal recipes have gained much attention.The polyherbal recipe containing ginger, Chinese date, and wood ear mushroom is reputed for atherosclerosis and stroke prevention.It has been long-term consumed without scienti ﬁc support.Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the neuroprotective eﬀ ect and its mechanisms in animal model of ischemic stroke with MetS.Male Wistar rats weighing 180-220 g were exposed to a 16-week high-fat high- carbohydrate feeding.The rats with the MetS characteristic were exposed to a temporary occlusion of the right middle cerebralartery (MCAO) for 90 minutes.
They were orally fed with the polyherbal recipe (GCJ) at the doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kgBW for 21 days and assessed the neurological de ﬁcit, ion volume, cortical neuron density in the cerebral cortex, oxidative stress status, in ﬂammation, and expressions of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). The results showed that GCJ signiﬁ cantly improved all mentioned parameters.Therefore, GCJ is the potential neuroprotectant against ischemic stroke with MetS.The underlying mechanisms may involve the reduction of oxidative stress, in ﬂammation, and the modi ﬁcation of epigenetic mechanism via the reduction of HDAC3 and DNMT1.However, further clinical investigation is essential to con ﬁrm this positive modulation eﬀ ect.1.Introduction Metabolic syndrome (Mets), a cluster of conditions including hypertension, diabetes, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and centralobesity, is recognized as an important risk factor for strokedevelopment [1, 2].
MetS disturbs cerebral microvascular blood ﬂow giving rise to the reduction of cerebral blood ﬂow and ﬁnally exposing the brain tissue to a higher state of hypoxia [3]. In addition, the elevatio no fp r o o x i d a t i v ea n dp r o i n ﬂamma- tory states induced by MetS also contributes an important role on the development of atheroscler o t i cp l a q u ea n dt h r o m b o s i s -embolic stroke [4].Therefore, the prevalence of stroke withMetS appears to increase in accompany with the increasingtrend of MetS [5].It has been reported that stroke with MetSshows poor prognosis.In additi on, stroke survivors with MetS also show the higher mortality rate and stroke recurrence thanthose without MetS [6].Since stroke produces a great socioeco-nomic burden and the current th erapeutic strategy is still limited, it is very esse ntial to prevent it [7].At present, the application of herbal products for stroke prevention has gained much attention.
Although the herbal products in the market are present both in single herbHindawi BioMed Research International Volume 2022, Article ID 8940303, 14 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/8940303 formulation and in polyherbal formulation, the concept of polyherbalism has gained much attention because the activephytochemical constituents presented in each individualplant usually exist in a small amount and do not achievetherapeutic levels. The combination of herbs often providesgreater bene ﬁts due to the synergistic interaction.One possi- ble explanation for the positive modulation e ﬀect induced by synergistic e ﬀect is the capacity to exert the e ﬀect at multiple targets simultaneously which is suitable for the complex dis- orders which involve multiple factors.In addition, most polyherbal formulation often provides the desirable e ﬀect with lower dose than the single formulation [8].
In Thailand,the polyherbal drink containing ginger ( Zingiber o ﬃcinale Roscoe), Chinese date ( Ziziphus jujuba Mill.), and wood ear mushroom or Jew ’s ear mushroom ( Auricularia auric- ula-judae ) has been consumed by the Thai-Chinese descents in the northern part of Thailand based on the belief that thispolyherbal drink can improve blood cholesterol and athero-sclerosis. Due to the crucial role of atherosclerosis on thepathophysiology of stroke [2], the polyherbal drink men-tioned earlier is also used for preventing ischemic stroke.However, no scientiﬁ c evidence concerning this e ﬀect is available.Therefore, this study was set up to determine the eﬀect of this polyherbal recipe and to explore its underlying mechanisms in animal model of metabolic syndrome withischemic stroke.2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Preparation of the Polyherbal Recipe (GCJ).Ginger, Chi- nese date, and wood ear mushroom were harvested fromOctober 2020 to January 2021.
The ginger ( Zingiber o ﬃci- nale Roscoe) was authenticated by the KKU herbarium (KKU-NO. 25652), and Chinese date ( Ziziphus jujube Mill.) was identi ﬁed by KKU herbarium (KKU-NO.25654).The voucher specimens ginger and Chinese datewere authenticated by Assistant Professor Pimwadee Porn-pongrungrueng, the plant taxonomy expert from the Fac-ulty of Science, Khon Kaen University.The wood ear orthe Jew ’s ear mushroom ( Auricularia auricula-judae Bull.) utilized for this study was sourced from Mahasarakhamprovince, International Herbarium Index (MSUT-7282).Voucher specimens were authenticated by Assistant Pro-fessor Khwanruan Naksuwankul and deposited at High Human Performance and Health Promotion Research Institute (HHP&HP), Khon Kaen University, Thailand.For the extract preparation, ginger, Chinese date, andwood ear mushroom were washed, dried in the oven (72hours at 60 °C), and grounded as powder.
Both ginger and wood ear mushroom were prepared as water extractby using a decoction technique whereas a water extractof Chinese date was prepared using maceration technique.All extracts were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.Following this process, the solution was harvested and ﬁl- trated with Whatman paper. Then, they were dried with a freeze dryer.The polyherbal recipe was prepared by com- bining all extracts at a ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 owing to the highestpotential in biological activities associated with the patho-physiology of metabolic syndrome and ischemic stroke.2.2.Experimental Protocol.All animals used in this study were male Wistar rats weighing 180-220 g from Nomura SiamInternational Co., Ltd., Thailand.They were housed in stan-dard metal cages (6 animals per cage), under the standard con-dition with 23 ± 2 °C, 12 : 12 hours of the light-dark cycle, and were allowed free access to water and food throughout thestudy.
All animals were subjected to a one-week acclimatiza-tion period. All procedures in this study were approved bythe Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (report no.IACUC-KKU 42/63).After acclimatization, all rats were randomly divided into 8g r o u p s( N=6/group).Rats in group I (ND+vehicle) were treated with a normal diet (4.5% fat, 44.8% carbohydrate, 24% protein, and 5% ﬁber) whereas rats in group II-group VIII were fed with high-carbohydrate high-fat diet (HCHF)(19.36% fat, 52.94% carbohydrate, 22.2% protein, and 3.28%ﬁber) in order to induce metabolic syndrome and this rat model can produce the physiological changes and manifesta-tion mimic metabolic syndrome in human better than othermodels [9, 10].
To mimic the real situation in MetS, only ratsthat showed the characteristic similar to those presented in the human metabolic syndrome condition such as obesity (the body weight gain more than 40% [11]), hyperglycemia (theplasma glucose more than 100 mg/dL [12]), and hypertension(systolic and diastolic pressure more than 130 and 85 mmHg[13]) were recruited for further study. Rats in group II(HCHF+sham+vehicle) were exposed to sham operationwhile rats in group III-group VIII were exposed to a tempo-rary occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCAO)via a 90-minute reperfusion injury.Group II was designed toobserve the e ﬀect of sham operation and vehicle on the inter- ested brain parameters.After MCAO, rats in group III (HCHF+MCAO+vehicle), group IV (HCHF+MCAO+vitamin C), and group V (HCHF+MCAO+piracetam) were fed with vehi- cle, vitamin C (250 mg/kg BW), and piracetam (250 mg/kgBW), respectively.
Group III was designed to observe the e ﬀect of MCAO which mimicked brain injury, and brain dysfunc-tion presented in ischemic stroke because vehicle is waterand produced no e ﬀect on the parameters just mentioned. Both group IV and group V were served as the positive controlgroup because both vitamin C (a well-known antioxidant) andpiracetam (a standard drug used for treating stroke in order toimprove cerebral blood ﬂow and neuroin ﬂammation) showed the positive modulation e ﬀects on the observed parameters and they were included for comparing the observed e ﬀects with the experimental group.In groups VI-VIII (HCHF+MCAO+GCJ), all MetS rats were fed with GCJ at the dosesof 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg BW, respectively.These groupswere experimental groups.
The administrations of theassigned substances were performed continually for 21 days.The assessment of severity of neurological de ﬁcit was carried out by using modi ﬁed neurological severity scores (mNSS) every 7 days throughout the study period. The determinationof brain infarction volume, brain edema, brain oxidative stressmarkers including malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and theactivities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) together with the assessment of inﬂammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was also performed.In2 BioMed Research International addition, the modi ﬁcation of epigenetic mechanism was also evaluated via the changes in histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expressions.Allexperimental protocols are shown in Figure 1.2.3.Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R) Injury.
After an anesthetiza- tion with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg BW), a midline incision of the neck was performed. Following this step, asilicon-coated nylon was inserted into the right common carotid artery lumen and passed through the internal carotid artery until the middle cerebral artery was occluded.Theocclusion was performed for 90 minutes, and the nylon wasremoved to induce reperfusion injury.Sham-operated ratswere subjected to the same processes except that no occlusionof a middle cerebral artery was performed.After the operation,the wound was sutured, and an animal was transferred to thecage after recovering from an anesthetization [14 –16].2.4.The Modi ﬁed Method of Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) Assessment.The neurological de ﬁcits comprising motor, sensory, re ﬂex, and balance were monitored by using the modi ﬁed method of neurological severity scores (mNSS).
The neurological de ﬁcit score was graded by the trained and experienced observers who were blind to the treatment groupsof the animals. The scores were in the range between 0 and 18.The mild injury represented the score between 1 and 6whereas moderate injury represented the score between 7and 12 and the scores in the range between 13 and 18 indi-cated severe injury [17, 18].2.5.Assessment of Brain Infarction Volume.An assessment was performed 24 hours after MCAO due to the optimum change of brain infarction induced by MCAO during this period [19].Brain was isolated and cut as a coronal sectionat 2 mm thickness.Each section was immersed in 2.0% 2,3,5-TTC (Sigma, St.Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at 37 °C (15 min with each surface facing up).All slices were washedtwice in saline, ﬁxed in 10% bu ﬀered formalin (pH 7.4), and left to stand at 4 °C overnight in a lightproof container [15, 16].2.6.Brain Water Content Assessment.
The brain tissue collec- tion was performed at 24 hours after a reperfusion injury. Anassessment was carried out by weighing the brain wet weight and then subsequently allowed to dry at 100 °C for 24 hours.Following this step, it was measured as brain dry weight.The ﬁnal brain water content was calculated using [14] Water content =wet weight −dry weight ðÞ wet weight×1 0 0 %: ð1Þ 2.7.Cresyl Violet Staining.The isolated brains were ﬁxed with 4% of paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (pH 7.4) at4 °C and cryoprotected by immersing in a 30% formalin- sucrose (Merck, Germany) solution for 2-3 days.Then, theywere prepared as a coronal section at 10 μm thick by using cryostat (Thermo Scienti ﬁc™HM 525 Cryostat).All sections were placed on slides coated with 0.3 percent gelatin bu ﬀer containing 0.05% aluminium potassium sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).
Prior to the cresyl violet staining process, allslides were air dried and rehydrated in graded concentrationsof ethanol and xylene, respectively. Then, they were incubatedin 0.2% of cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 20 minutesaccordingly [20, 21], decolorized in acetic acid, dehydrated,and cover slipped with Permount.The evaluation of neuronaldensity in the sensorimotor cortex (bregma 1.6 to -3.0, ante-rior to posterior) was performed by using an Olympus lightmicroscope type BH-2 (Japan) at 40x magni ﬁcation.The anal- ysis was performed speci ﬁcally focused on neuropil, neuronal size, and shape [22].The density of the survival neurons was expressed as the number of neurons per 255 μm 2[22].2.8.Oxidative Stress Marker Assessment 2.8.1.Lipid Peroxidation Assessment.Level of malondialde- hyde (MDA) in the cerebral cortex was monitored by using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) method[23].
Brie ﬂy, 50 μL of tissue homogenate, 50 μL sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (SDS; Sigma-Aldrich, USA),375μL 20% acetic acid solution, 375 μL of 0.8% of thiobarbi- turic acid (TBA) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 150 μL of dis- tilled water (DW) were mixed and heated in 95 °C for 1 hour. After the samples were cooled, 250 μL of distilled water and 1250 μL of mixture of n-butanol : pyridine (15 :1v/v; Merck, Germany) were added and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4000 rpm to extract the TBARS (pink com-plex color).Butanolic phase was collected and measured anabsorbance at 532 nm.The brain level of MDA was calcu-lated by using a 1,3,3-tetramethoxy propane (Sigma-Aldrich108383-100ML) standard curve at the concentration rangebetween 0 and 15 μM.The measurement was performed in triplicate, and results were expressed as ng/mg protein.2.8.2.Assessment of Antioxidant Enzymes.
Superoxide dis- mutase activity (SOD) was monitored via the presence of superoxide free radical generated by the cytochrome Creduction [24]. In brief, 200 μL of the reaction mixture com- prising 57 mM of phosphate buﬀ er solution (KH 2PO4), 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 50 μM of xanthine solution, and 10 mM of cytochrome C solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was mixedwith 20 μL of samples or 1 to 25 units/mL of superoxide dis- mutase enzyme standard (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).An absor-bance was assessed at a wavelength of 415 nm.The unit ofmeasurement in SOD activity was expressed as SOD activity per mg protein.Catalase (CAT) activity was determined following the method of Palachai et al.[25].The assay mixture consisting of 50 μLo f3 0 m Mo fH 2O2in 50 mM phosphate buﬀ er, pH 7.0, 150 μL of 5 mM KMnO4, and 25 μLo fH2SO4(Sigma- Aldrich, USA) was mixed with 10 μL of brain homogenate and determined an absorbance at 490 nm by using a micro-plate reader.
An enzymatic assessment was performed intriplicate, and results were expressed as units of CAT activityper milligram of protein (U/mg protein). The determination in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was performed by adding 20 μL of tissue sample to the reaction mixture containing 10 μL of 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 6.67 mM potassium phosphate buﬀ er (pH 7), 100μL of 1 mM sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 10 μL3 BioMed Research International of 50 mM glutathione solution, and 100 μL of 30% H2O2 (BDH Chemicals Ltd., UK).Subsequently, 10 μLo f1 0 m M DTNB (5,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added and incubated for 5 minutes at room tem-perature.An absorbance was assessed using a microplatereader at a wavelength of 412 nm.Results were presentedas units per mg protein [25].2.9.Western Blot Assessment.
Inﬂammation and epigenetic mechanism play the crucial roles in brain damage induced by ischemic stroke [22, 26 –28], so we also determined the eﬀect of the polyherbal recipe on these indicators. In this study, we used western blot for determining the expressionsof inﬂammatory cytokines such as interlukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor- α(TNF- α) and the expressions of both histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) in the cerebral cortex.Brain samples of the cere- bral cortex from an ipsilateral side were homogenized with the extraction of mammalian reagent (M-PER) and the proteasecocktail inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at the ratio of 1 : 10for the assessment of in ﬂammatory markers.
The brain sam-ples were lysed in RIPA bu ﬀer or subjected to a radioimmuno- precipitation assay that incorporated 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na 2EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate,1m MN a 3VO4, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μg/mL leu- peptin, and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride for the assessment of HDAC3 and DNMT1. All brain homogenateswere subjected to a 12,000 gcentrifugation at 4 °Cf o r1 0 minutes.A volume of 80 μg of sample was incubated with loading bu ﬀer Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad, USA) for 10 minutes at 95°C.Then, 20 μL of the mixture was loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and separated it by sodium dode-cyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).Following the electrophoresis process, protein bands weretransferred from the gel to nitrocellulose membranes, and theywere washed with 0.05% TBS-T.
After the washing process,the membranes were incubated in a blocking bu ﬀer containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% TBS-T at 25 °Cf o r1h o u r .A tt h ee n d of an incubation period, they were incubated with one of thefollowing primary antibodies: IL-6 (dilution 1 : 1000), TNF- α (dilution 1 : 1000), DNMT-1 (dilution 1 : 1000), HDAC-3 Male wistar rats (weighing 180-220 g, age 8-10 weeks) High-carbohydrate high-fat (HCHF) Normal dietVehiclePositive control (i) Neurological deficit score, brain infarction volume and brain water content (ii) Neuron density in cerebral cortex(iii) Biological assessments: oxidative stress alteration in cerebral cortex(iv) The expression of inflammatory markers : IL-6 and TNF-𝛼 (v) The expression of DNMT1 and HDAC33.Rt.MCAO4.VitaminC (250 mg/kg BW)5.Piracetam (250 mg/kg BW)6.

All membranes were then washed with 0.05% T-PBS for 30 minutes.Further incubation with secondary enzyme-linked antibody (anti-rab- bit IgG, HRP-linked antibody obtained from Cell SignalingTechnology, USA; dilution 1 : 2000) was carried out toenhance signal transduction.The protein band densities weredetected using ECL detection systems and the LAS-4000 lumi-nescent image analyzer (GE Healthcare).ImageJ software sys-tem was used for the analysis of the band densities.The banddensity control normal group ’s numeric variables were expressed as relative density [25].2.10.Statistical Analysis.Data obtained from this study were expressed as mean ± SEM and statistically analyzed using SPSS software version 25.0.
The statistical di ﬀerence between the groups was obtained using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) whereas the data analyzed repetitively were per-formed with repeated measurement ANOVA, followed by a Tukey post hoc test. The pvalues below 0.05 were considered as signi ﬁcant changes between the test groups.3.Results 3.1.The Modi ﬁed Neurological Severity Score (mNSS), Brain Infarction Volume, and Brain Water Content.Figure 2 shows the motor de ﬁcit assessed by using mNSS.Our results showed that HCHF diet treated rats which received sham operation showed no signi ﬁcant neurological de ﬁcit whereas HCHF diet treated rats which received MCAO showed the signi ﬁcant increase in mNSS when compared to the rats which receivednormal diet and vehicle treatments throughout the studyperiod ( pvalue <0.001, all).
These data suggested that HCHFplus sham operation and vehicle treatment produced no in ﬂu- ence on mNSS and the alteration in mNSS observed in HCHF+MCAO+vehicle appeared to occur as the result of MCAO. When compared between HCHF diet treated rats subjected to sham operation and HCHF diet treated rats which sub-jected to MCAO, our data showed that MCAO signi ﬁcantly increased mNSS in HCHF diet treated rats at 7, 14, and 21days after MCAO ( pvalue <0.001, all).These data pointed out that MCAO played an essential role on the elevation ofmNSS.The signi ﬁcant elevation in mNSS induced by MCAO was mitigated by vitamin C, piracetam, and GCJ at the dosesof 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg BW throughout the study period(pvalue <0.001, all) as shown in Figure 2.Owing to the same pattern of changes in mNSS induced by the substances men-tioned earlier, the similar underlying mechanisms of the tested substances had been considered.
The e ﬀect of various treatments in this study on brain infarction volume was also monitored, and results are shown in Figure 3. It was found that no brain infarction volume wasobserved in rats fed with normal diet and received vehicle(ND+vehicle) and in rats fed with HCHF diet and receivedsham operation plus vehicle treatment.These data suggestedthat HCHF plus sham operation and vehicle treatment failedto produce brain infarction.MCAO signi ﬁcantly increased brain infarction volume in the cerebral cortex, striatum,and hippocampus when compared to the ND+vehicle group(pvalue <0.001).The comparison of brain infarction vol- ume between HCHF+MCAO+vehicle treated rats andHCHF+sham+vehicle treated also showed the same pattern(pvalue <0.001, all).Therefore, a brain infarction volume observed in this group occurred because of MCAO.

These data also pointed out that the mitigation e ﬀect on brain infarction of the GCJ mentioned earlier might occur via the reductionof oxidative stress and the improvement of cerebral bloodﬂow similar to the e ﬀects of vitamin C and piracetam.The eﬀect of various interventions on brain water content is shown in Figure 4.The current data showed no signi ﬁcant diﬀerence in the contralateral brain water content.
In addition, HCHF diet treated rats which received sham operation andvehicle also failed to show the signi ﬁcant change in the ipsilat- eral brain water content. These data indicated that HCHF, sham operation, and vehicle exerted no signi ﬁcant in ﬂuence on the brain water content.When compared to ND+vehicle treated rats, MCAO signi ﬁcantly enhanced the ipsilateral brain water content ( pvalue <0.01) but no signi ﬁcant di ﬀer- ence was observed when compared to HCHF+sham+vehicle.Therefore, HCHF+sham+vehicle might also produce slightchange on brain edema although the change was not signi ﬁ- cant.This might be associated with the injury induced by anoperation.Piracetam and GCJ at the doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg BW signi ﬁcantly decreased the elevation of the ipsi- lateral brain water content in HCHF rats which received MCAO ( pvalue <0.05, 0.01, 0.01, and 0.01, respectively; com- pared to HCHF+MCAO+vehicle).
These changes suggestedthat the improvement in brain edema was not principallyattributed to an oxidative stress but might be principally asso-ciated with the alteration in the blood ﬂow dynamic like the action of piracetam. 3.2.Cortical Neuron Density.The e ﬀect of various interven- tions on cortical neuron density is shown in Figure 5.When compared to the ND+vehicle group, HCHF plus sham opera-tion and vehicle treated rats showed a slight reduction in neu-ron density in the cerebral cortex but no signi ﬁcance was observed.MCAO signi ﬁcantly decreased the cortical neuron density in HCHF plus vehicle treated rats ( pvalue <0.001, compared to the ND+vehicle group; pvalue <0.01, compared to the HCHF+sham+vehicle group).

The eﬀect of GCJ on the alteration of oxidative stress status of the cerebral cortex, a brain regionwhich showed the optimum changes induced by MCAO, wasmonitored via the alterations of the level of a lipid peroxida-tion product or MDA level and the alterations of main antiox-idant enzymes in the brain including SOD, CAT, and GPx.Table 1 shows that HCHF+sham+vehicle treated rats failedto show the signi ﬁcant changes of all parameters mentioned above in the cerebral cortex. These data suggested that MetS rats induced by HCHF diet subjected to sham operation and vehicle treatment did not produce any signi ﬁcant e ﬀect on oxi- dative stress status.HCHF+MCAO+vehicle treated rats signif-icantly decreased the activities of SOD ( pvalue <0.001, compared to ND+vehicle; pvalue <0.001, compared to HCHF+sham+vehicle), CAT ( pvalue <0.001, compared to ND+vehicle; pvalue <0.001, compared to HCHF+sham +vehicle), and GPx ( pvalue <0.01, compared to ND+vehicle).
However, the level of MDA in this brain region of HCHF+MCAO+vehicle treated rats was increased ( pvalue <0.01, compared to ND+vehicle; pvalue <0.01, compared to HCHF+sham+vehicle). Vitamin C and GCJ at all doses usedin this study signi ﬁcantly mitigated the changes of MDA ( p value <0.05, 0.01, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively; compared to HCHF+MCAO+vehicle), SOD ( pvalue <0.001, all; com-pared to HCHF+MCAO+vehicle), and CAT ( pvalue <0.01, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.01, respectively; compared to HCHF+MCAO+vehicle).The signi ﬁcant increase in GPx was also observed in HCHF and MCAO treated rats which receivedvitamin C and GCJ at the doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg BW(pvalue <0.05, all; compared to HCHF+MCAO+vehicle).Piracetam treatment could enhance only CAT activity inHCHF+MCAO treated rats ( pvalue <0.01, compared to HCHF+MCAO+vehicle).3.4.In ﬂammation and Epigenetic Mechanism.
The e ﬀects of GCJ on the expressions of in ﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF- αand epigenetic mechanism via the modi ﬁca- tion of HDAC3 and DNMT1 were also determined, and results are shown in Figure 6. Figures 6(a) –6(c) revealed that no signi ﬁcant changes in the cortical expressions of both IL- 6 and TNF- αwere observed in HCHF+sham+vehicle treated rats.Therefore, sham operation and vehicle treatment pro- duced no e ﬀects on both HDAC3 and DNMT1 in MetS rats induced by HCHF.MCAO signi ﬁcantly increased the corti- cal expressions of IL-6 and TNF- α(pvalue <0.01 and 0.001, respectively; compared to ND+vehicle) in MetS rats inducedby HCHF diet.
Interestingly, GCJ at the doses of 100, 200,and 300 mg/kg BW signi ﬁcantly decreased the expressions of IL-6 ( pvalue <0.05, 0.05, and 0.001, respectively; com- pared to HCHF+MCAO+vehicle) and TNF- α(pvalue < 0.001, all; compared to HCHF+MCAO+vehicle) while vita-min C failed to show the positive modulation e ﬀect on both IL-6 and TNF- αand piracetam signi ﬁcantly decreased only 020406080100120 Left side Right sideBrain water content (%)AA ⁎⁎ ⁎⁎ ⁎⁎ ⁎ ND + Vehicle HCHF + MCAO + GCJ200 HCHF + MCAO + VehicleHCHF + MCAO + Piracetam HCHF + Sham + Vehicle HCHF + MCAO + GCJ100 HCHF + MCAO + Vitamin C HCHF + MCAO + GCJ300 Figure 4: Eﬀect of the polyherbal recipe containing ginger, Chinese date, and wood ear mushroom (GCJ) at the doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg BW on both contralateral (left) and ipsilateral (right) brain water content.

Our data in Figures 6(a), 6(d), and 6(e) clearly demon- strated that HCHF+sham+vehicle treated rats failed to show the signi ﬁcant changes in both DNMT1 and HDAC3. These data suggested that sham operation did not modify the expres-sions of both parameters in MetS rats induced by HCHF diet.HCHF+MCAO+vehicle produced the signi ﬁcant elevation in the cortical expressions of the aforementioned parameters ( p value <0.05, all, compared to HCHF+MCAO+vehicle and p value <0.05, all, compared to HCHF+MCAO+vehicle).Therefore, the changes in DNMT1 and HDAC3 expressionin MetS rats induced by HCHF diet might occur as the resultof MCAO.The elevation of DNMT1 expression in the cerebral cortex of HCHF+MCAO+vehicle treated rats was attenuated by vitamin C, piracetam, and all doses of GCJ used in thisstudy ( pvalue <0.01, 0.05, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively; compared to HCHF+MCAO+vehicle).
In addition, all inter-ventions mentioned earlier also mitigated the elevation ofHDAC3 in the cerebral cortex of HCHF+MCAO+vehicletreated rats ( pvalue <0.01, 0.01, 0.05, 0.05, and 0.001, respec- tively; compared to HCHF+MCAO+vehicle). 4.Discussion This is the ﬁrst report to demonstrate the neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia with metabolic syndrome of thereputed polyherbal recipe widely used in the Thai-Chinesedescendants for a long time.Interestingly, it can exert theeﬀect to modulate epigenetic mechanism via the suppression of DNMT1 and HDAC3 expression in the cerebral cortex.The changes are observed accompanied with the reductionof MDA, a lipid peroxidation marker, and in ﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF- α, the elevation of antioxi- dant enzymes such as SOD, CAT, and GPx, and the reduc-tion of brain infarction volume, neurodegeneration, brainedema, and neurological de ﬁcit.
In this study, a transient ischemic rat has been used as an animal model owing to its reputation as the best model forstudying the survival and the functional recovery of ischemicstroke [29]. It has been demonstrated that a transient occlu-sion of a middle cerebral artery induces oxidative stress and neuroin ﬂammation [30].The substances possessing the sup- pression e ﬀect on oxidative stress and neuroin ﬂammation such as polyphenol can improve brain damage and brain dys- function in an ischemic stroke model [31, 32].These pieces ofinformation correspond with our results which demonstratedthat all doses of GCJ, a polyphenol-enriched polyherbal recipecontaining ginger, Chinese date, and wood ear mushroom,also improve both oxidative stress status and in ﬂammation leading to an improvement of neurological de ﬁcit.Recently, the role of epigenetic mechanism in the regula- tion of gene transcription in stroke has been clearly revealed [26, 33].
The current data showed the elevation of DNMT1 and HDAC3 in cerebral ischemia corresponding with thechanges in the previous studies [34–39].

Theimprovement in oxidative stress imbalance and in ﬂamma- tion in turn give rise to the decrease in neurodegenerationand brain infarction induced by MCAO and ﬁnally improve neurological de ﬁcit. In addition, brain damage following ischemic stroke often disrupts the blood-brain barrier givingrise to an increase in paracellular permeability resulting inthe extravasation of blood components into the brain andﬁnally induces cerebral vasogenic edema [41].Therefore, the increase in brain water content which indicated brain edemaobserved in this study might occur as the result of a cerebralvasogenic edema induced by brain damage and blood-brainbarrier disruption.The reduction of brain edema induced byGCJ may be associated with the reduction in brain damagewhich in turn decreases blood-brain barrier disruption.Our data clearly revealed that MCAO produces a signif- icant increase in cortical expression of DNMT1 and HDAC3in HCHF+vehicle treated rats.
This ﬁnding is in agreement with the previous results obtained from many studies[42–46]. Taken all data together, we suggest that GCJ pro- tects against brain damage and brain dysfunction in animalmodel ischemia stroke with metabolic syndrome conditionvia the suppression of DNMT1 and HDAC3 expressions inthe cerebral cortex giving rise to the decrease in in ﬂamma- tion [42] via the reduction of IL-6 and TNF- αleading to an improvement of brain infarction area and brain edematogether with the neurological de ﬁcit.In addition, the sup- pression of HDAC3 also suppresses oxidative stress whichin turn decreases brain infarction area, brain edema, andneurological de ﬁcit.Due to the very high concentration ofa polyphenol such as gingerol in GCJ and the neuroprotec-tive eﬀect against stroke of ginger [47], we suggest that the possible active ingredient may partly involve gingerol pre-sented in GCJ.No dose-dependent e ﬀect of GCJ is observed.
The possible explanation may be due to the masking e ﬀect of other ingredients and the nonlinear relationship between theobserved parameters and the concentrations of GCJ. 5.Conclusion Since stroke produces a great socioeconomic burden and thecurrent therapeutic strategy is still limited, it is very essentialto prevent it [7].This study has been focused on the noninva-sive strategy for preventing the ischemic stroke with metabolicsyndrome which is more severe than ischemic stroke withoutmetabolic syndrome.This study is the ﬁrst scienti ﬁce v i d e n c e to prove that the reputed polyherbal recipe (GCJ) can improvebrain damage and brain dysfunction induced by ischemicstroke with metabolic syndrome.
Moreover, the novelty isthe scienti ﬁc evidence which clearly demonstrates the nutrige- nomic e ﬀect of GCJ via the modulation e ﬀect on an epigenetic mechanism by suppressing the expression of DNMT1 and HDAC3 in the cerebral cortex and gives rise to the reduction of inﬂammation and oxidative stress resulting in an increase of cortical neuron density and the reduction in brain infarc-tion, brain edema, and neurological de ﬁcit as shown in Figure 7. Therefore, GCJ may serve as the potential candidatefood supplement for stroke protection.However, a clinicaltrial study to con ﬁrm this bene ﬁt is essential.
