ORIGINAL ARTICLE L-carnitine as a Potential Additive in Blood Storage Solutions: A Study on Erythrocytes R.Soumya1•H.Carl1•R.Vani1 Received: 20 January 2015 / Accepted: 6 July 2015 / Published online: 11 July 2015 /C211Indian Society of Haematology & Transfusion Medicine 2015 Abstract Erythrocytes undergo various changes during storage (storage lesion) that in turn reduces their func- tioning and survival.Oxidative stress plays a major role in the storage lesion and antioxidants can be used to combat this stress.This study elucidates the effects of L-carnitine (LC) on erythrocytes of stored blood.Blood was obtained from male Wistar rats and stored (4 /C176C) for 20 days in CPDA-1 (citrate phosphate dextrose adenine) solution.Samples were divided into–(i) controls (ii) LC 10 ( L-car- nitine at a concentration of 10 mM) (iii) LC 30 ( L-carnitine at a concentration of 30 mM) and (iv) LC 60 ( L-carnitine at a concentration of 60 mM).
Every ﬁfth day, the biomarkers (haemoglobin, hemolysis, antioxidant enzymes, lipid per- oxidation and protein oxidation products) were analysed in erythrocytes. Hemoglobin and protein sulfhydryls were insigniﬁcant during storage indicative of the maintenance of hemoglobin and sulfhydryls in all groups.Superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde levels increased initially and decreased towards the end of storage.The levels of catalase and glutathione peroxidase were lower in experi- mentals than controls during storage.L-carnitine assisted the enzymes by scavenging the reactive oxygen species produced.Hemolysis increased in all groups with storage, elucidating that L-carnitine could not completely protect lipids and proteins from oxidative stress.
Hence, this study opens up new avenues of using L-carnitine as a component of storage solutions with combinations of antioxidants in order to maintain efﬁcacy of erythrocytes.Keywords Erythrocytes /C1Storage /C1L-carnitine /C1 Lipid peroxidation /C1Protein oxidation Introduction Erythrocytes undergo various biochemical and structural changes that impair their oxygen-delivering capacity and trigger secondary reactions when stored [ 1–3]. These changes, collectively constituting the ‘‘storage lesion’’, are characterized by morphological, physiological, biochemi- cal, metabolic and biomechanical changes.Oxidative stress (OS) has been shown to play a major role in the formation of storage lesion [ 4–7].Various mechanisms inherent to erythrocytes combat the damage caused by oxidative stress, primarily involving small molecules that efﬁciently repair damage to macromolecules [ 8–10].
A variety of compo- nents act against the damage caused by OS, which are of both endogenous and exogenous origin, such as (i) nutri- ent-derived antioxidants, (ii) antioxidant enzymes and (iii) metal binding proteins [ 11]. Carnitine is one of the nutrient-derived, non-enzymatic antioxidants [ 12,13] that plays an important role in phospholipid fatty acid turnover.L-carnitine, the biologi- cally active stereoisomer, is an endogenous compound derived from the diet or synthesized in the liver from lysine and methionine [ 14,15].Erythrocytes, which do not contain mitochondria, have substantial amounts of L-carnitine and its esters [ 16].The effect of L-carnitine on erythrocytes has been studied by Arduini et al.[ 17] which showed that the uptake of L- carnitine during erythrocyte storage was associated with lower hemolysis and higher erythrocyte-ATP (adenosine triphosphate) levels and by a signiﬁcantly greater in vivo viability in L-carnitine erythrocytes stored in additive&R.

L-carnitine or its short-chain esters have demonstrated a positive effect on the stability of erythro- cyte membranes under various adverse conditions and they also have been found to affect the molecular dynamics oferythrocyte membrane components [ 18–22].Though there are few studies on carnitine and storage [17], the overall effect of L-carnitine on erythrocytes of stored blood has not been evaluated.The storage lesion developed in rats in CPDA-1 (citrate phosphate dextrose adenine) stored for one week is similar to that of human erythrocytes stored for 4 weeks [ 23].
Hence, this study aims to investigate the inﬂuence of L-carnitine on rat ery- throcytes during blood storage, by assessing the following biomarkers of OS - hemoglobin, antioxidant enzymes and protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation products. Materials and Methods Animal Care and Maintenance Animal care and maintenance was in accordance with the ethical committee regulations (841/b/04/CPCSEA).Blood Sampling Animals were lightly anaesthetized with ether and restrained in dorsal recumbancy as described earlier [ 6].In brief, the syringe needle was inserted just below the xyphoid cartilage and slightly to the left of midline.Bloodwas carefully aspirated from the heart into plastic collect- ing tubes with CPDA-1 solution.Experimental Design Blood was drawn from male Wistar rats (4 months old) and stored over a period of time (20 days) at 4 /C176C in CPDA-1 solution in polypropylene tubes.
Blood was collected from 20 animals and divided into four groups (5 animals each)–(i) Controls (ii) LC 10 (samples with L-carnitine at a con- centration of 10 mM) (iii) LC 30 (samples with L-carnitine at a concentration of 30 mM) and (iv) LC 60 (samples with L-carnitine at a concentration of 60 mM Erythrocytes were isolated from the above samples every ﬁfth day and the biomarkers of OS were studied. Erythrocyte Separation The erythrocytes were isolated by centrifugation for 20 min at 1000 9gat 4/C176C.The plasma and buffy coat were removed using a micropipette.The cell pellet was washedand ﬁnally suspended in isotonic phosphate buffer [ 24].This constituted the erythrocyte suspension.Hemoglobin Estimation Hemoglobin (Hb) was measured using Hemocor-D Kit [Coral Clinical Systems, Goa, India], which utilizes cyanomethemoglobin method [ 25].Whole blood was incubated with Hb reagent for 3 min at room temperature and absorbance was measured colorimetrically at 540 nm.
Hb concentration was represented in terms of g dl -1. Antioxidant Enzymes Superoxide Dismutase [SOD, EC 1.15.1.1] SOD was measured by the method of Misra and Fridovich [26].Hemolysate was added to carbonate buffer [0.05 M].Epinephrine was added to the mixture and measured [ELICO, Model SL 159, India] at 480 nm.SOD activity isexpressed as the amount of enzyme that inhibits oxidation of epinephrine by 50 %.Catalase: [CAT, EC 1.11.1.6] CAT was determined by the method of Aebi [ 27].Brieﬂy, hemolysate with absolute alcohol was incubated at 0 /C176C.An aliquot was taken up with 6.6 mM H 2O2and decrease in absorbance was measured at 240 nm.An extinctioncoefﬁcient of 43.6 M cm -1was used to determine enzyme activity.Glutathione Peroxidase [GSH-Px, EC.1.11.1.9] GSH-Px was analyzed by the method of Flohe and Gunzler [28].
Fifty microlitres of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 100lL enzyme sample, 100 lL glutathione reductase (0.24 units), and 100 lL of 10 mM GSH (glutathione) were mixed and pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 /C176C fol- lowed by addition of 100 lL of 1.5 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in 0.1 % sodiumbicarbonate. The overall reaction was started by adding 100 lL of pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide and the decrease in absorption at 340 nm was monitored for three min.Enzyme activity was expressed as units/g Hb; 1 unit cor- responds to 1 mM NADPH oxidized/min.Malondialdehyde (MDA) Malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation was determined according to the method of Ohkawa et al.[29].In brief, the hemolysate was added to 8.1 % sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), vortexed and incubated at room temperature.This was followed by the addition of 20 % acetic acid and 0.6 % thiobarbituric acid, and placed inboiling water bath.
The samples were allowed to cool andIndian J Hematol Blood Transfus (July-Sept 2016) 32(3):328–334 329 123 butanol-pyridine was added and centrifuged. Absorbance of the coloured layer was measured at 532 nm with 1, 1, 3, 3-tetramethoxy propane as a standard.MDA concentration was expressed as nmol mg-1protein.Protein Sulfhydryls (P-SH) The concentration of P-SH groups in the proteins was measured in lysate as described by Habeeb [ 30].In brief, 0.08 mol L-1sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.5 mg mL-1of ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid dis- odium salt (Na 2-EDTA), and 2 % SDS were added to each assay tube.0.1 ml of 5, 50-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) was also added.Absorbance was measured at 412 nm.P-SH was calculated from the net absorbance andmolar absorptivity, 13,600 M -1L-1cm-1.Hemolysis A 5 % suspension of packed erythrocytes in buffer was mixed with the equal volume of 8 mM H 2O2.The mixtures were incubated at 37 /C176C in an incubator.
Hemolysis was determined by measuring released Hb into the supernatant of the induced samples at 540 nm and expressed on thebasis of the maximum absorbance [100 %] in the aliquots of erythrocytes completely hemolysed in distilled water [31]. Protein Determination Protein was determined in the lysate and membrane by the method of Lowry et al.using bovine serum albumin as the standard [ 32].Statistical Analyses Results are represented as mean ±standard error (SE).Values between the groups were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and was considered sig-niﬁcant at P \0.05.Bonferroni’s Post Test was performed for all the assays using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Values between the groups are represented in upper case, whilethose within the groups are represented in lower case.Results Hemoglobin Changes in Hb were insigniﬁcant during storage period in all samples, although changes between the subgroups wereobserved (Fig.

The superoxide radical can dismutate into hydrogen peroxide and react with Hb to generate additional potent oxidation by products [ 36,37]. Increase in SOD activity is indicative of increased generation of superoxideradicals [ 38].Our results of increased SOD during storage in controls (till day 10), is in correlation with increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 39].SOD decreased towards the end of storage to the initial day 0 values, indicative of the effective antioxidant system in erythro-cytes which scavenged the free radicals.In the L-carnitine groups, on day 10, the levels of SOD were found to be lower than that of the control.
This can be attributed to theantioxidant activity and modulation of SOD by L-carnitine, to counteract the excess free radicals produced during storage [ 40].L-carnitine and its derivatives have been shown to prevent the formation of ROS [ 39], scavenge free radicals (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) and protect cells from peroxidative stress [ 12,41–44]. Catalase and GSH-Px act on the same substrate, H 2O2, at high and low concentrations respectively [ 35,45,46].In accordance with the SOD activity, CAT and GSH-Px wereactivated initially during storage.The levels of CAT increased in controls on days 5 & 10, while GSH-Px showed increases on days 10 and 15 corresponding to theSOD activity, in turn indicative of the H 2O2produced.However, the levels of CAT and GSH-Px in the experi- mentals were lower than those in controls as storage pro-gressed.
This can be attributed to (i) the initial scavenging of superoxide by L-carnitine, hence reducing the H 2O2 formed and (ii) the H 2O2scavenging activity of L-carnitine [12,40]. During storage, OS causes various changes in the ery- throcyte membrane, affecting proteins and lipids.Freeradicals and intermediate peroxidation products damage the integrity and functioning of the membrane [ 47–49].Lipids (cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA))are the main targets of oxidative attack and this leads to the formation and the accumulation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) products [ 50–52].Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a marker of membrane LPO resulting from the interaction of ROS and the cellular membrane.The levels of MDA decreased in controlstowards the end of storage, indicative of the effective antioxidant system in the erythrocytes.
The decrease in MDA can also be attributed to microvesiculation whichoccurs in vitro [ 53] In the L-carnitine groups, peaks were observed on day 5 due to increase in ROS. The decrease in MDA in the LC groups to the control levels can beattributed to the combined effect of the initial scavenging of free radicals by L-carnitine [ 54] and the inherent Fig.3 Protein sulfhydryls in erythrocytes of stored blood (Lysate).Values are expressed as mean ±SE from 5 samples.LC 10— L- carnitine (10 mM); LC 30— L-carnitine (30 mM) LC 60— L-carnitine (60 mM).Changes between groups (across storage) are represented inupper case , while changes within a group (across treatment groups) are represented in lower case .Those not sharing the same letters are signiﬁcant Fig.4 Hemolysis in erythrocytes of stored blood.Values are expressed as mean ±SE from 5 samples.LC 10— L-carnitine (10 mM); LC 30— L-carnitine (30 mM) LC 60— L-carnitine (60 mM).

Protein sulfhydryls are sites of reversible and irreversible oxidative modiﬁcations. Sulfhydryls can be reversibly oxidized to disulﬁdes,S-thiolated, S-nitrosylated, and sulfenic acid forms of cysteines or irreversibly converted to sulﬁnic and sulfonic acid forms.The absence of sufﬁcient antioxidant protec-tion may cause irreversible damage to these reactive sites [58].Sulfhydryls maintain cellular integrity and are important to cellular functions.In this study, L-carnitine assisted in maintaining sulfhydryls in the reduced state throughout storage.Hemolysis caused by free radicals can be characterized by two key events: (i) lipid peroxidation and (ii) redistri- bution of oxidized band 3 within the membrane [ 59].Hemolysis increased in all groups, with progression instorage, indicating that L-carnitine could not protect lipids and proteins from oxidative damage.
Our ﬁndings show that the addition of L-carnitine assisted SOD, CAT and GSH-Px by scavenging superoxide and hydrogen peroxide while maintaining Hb and sulfhy- dryls with storage. The different concentrations of L-car- nitine have not shown signiﬁcant variations.As this study has focussed on the changes in the oxidative stress markers in rat erythrocytes with L-carnitine, there is a need to assess the biochemical changes associated with storage.Subse- quently, the effects of L-carnitine on human erythrocytes during storage should be determined.The results obtainedusing L-carnitine, clearly elucidates the need to explore the effectiveness of L-carnitine in combination with other antioxidants, to successfully combat the oxidative stressduring storage.In conclusion, L-carnitine has been successful as the ﬁrst line of defence against free radicals during storage.
Hence,this study opens up new avenues of using L-carnitine as a component of storage solutions with other antioxidants in order to maintain efﬁcacy of erythrocytes.
