In the present study, to clarify the relationship between VB6 de ﬁciency and schizophrenia, we generated VB6-de ﬁcient (VB6( −)) mice through feeding with a VB6-lacking diet as a mouse model for the subpopulation of schizophrenia patients with VB6 de ﬁciency. After feeding for 4 weeks, plasma VB6 level in VB6( −) mice decreased to 3% of that in control mice.The VB6( −) mice showed social de ﬁcits and cognitive impairment.Furthermore, the VB6( −) mice showed a marked increase in 3- methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in the brain, suggesting enhanced noradrenaline (NA) metabolism in VB6( −) mice.We con ﬁrmed the increased NA release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the striatum (STR) of VB6( −) mice through in vivo microdialysis.Moreover, inhibiting the excessive NA release by treatment with VB6 supplementation into the brain and α2A adrenoreceptor agonist guanfacine (GFC) suppressed the increased NA metabolism and ameliorated the behavioral de ﬁcits.
These ﬁndings suggest that the behavioral de ﬁcits shown in VB6( −) mice are caused by enhancement of the noradrenergic (NAergic) system. Introduction Vitamin B 6(VB6) is a generic name for a family of six interconvertible pyridine compounds: pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxamine (PM), and their respective 5′-phosphorylated forms (PLP, PNP, and PMP, respec- tively).PLP is a cofactor for over 150 enzymes (includingrepresentatives of every major enzyme class), whichaccount for ~4% of known enzymes 1.PLP-dependent enzymes are involved in the metabolism of the followingneurotransmitters: dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA),serotonin (5-HT: 5-hydroxytryptamine), glycine, D-serine, glutamate, γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), and histamine2.Thus, it is speculated that VB6 de ﬁciency affects the metabolism of many neurotransmitters, leading to impairments in brain function.
Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder characterized by positive symptoms such as hallucinationsand delusions, negative symptoms such as apathy and lackof emotion, and cognitive impairment. We have reportedthat PL levels in peripheral blood of a subpopulation ofpatients with schizophrenia is signi ﬁcantly lower than that of healthy controls 3–5.More than 35% of patients with schizophrenia have low levels of PL (clinically de ﬁned as male: <6 ng/ml, female: <4 ng/ml).These results havebeen replicated by other groups 6,7.

Additionally, we recently reported that high- dose PM was effective in alleviating psychotic symptoms, particularly the PANSS negative and general subscales, ina subset of patients with schizophrenia 8.Although a link between lower VB6 level and schizophrenia is widelyhypothesized, the mechanism behind this remains poorlyunderstood.
In the present study, to investigate the relationship between VB6 de ﬁciency and schizophrenia, we generated VB6-de ﬁcient (VB6( −)) mice by feeding with a VB6- lacking diet as a mouse model re ﬂecting the subpopula- tion of schizophrenia patients with VB6 de ﬁciency. We demonstrated that VB6( −) mice showed hyperactivate noradrenergic (NAergic) signaling, resulting in behavioraldeﬁcits comparable to schizophrenia.These are amelio- rated by VB6 supplementation into the brain and treat-ment with the α2A adrenoreceptor agonist guanfacine (GFC), which suppresses NA release.Materials and Methods Development of VB6-de ﬁcient mice We generated VB6( −) mice by feeding C57BL/6J male mice (Clea Japan Inc, Tokyo, Japan) with a VB6-lackingdiet containing 5 μg/100 g VB6 pellets from 8 to 12 weeks of age, while control mice were fed with a normal diet, with 1.4 mg/100 g VB6 pellets.The mice were randomly assigned to the control or the VB6( −) group.
They were housed in plastic cages and maintained in a regulatedenvironment (25 ± 1 °C, 50 ± 5% humidity) in a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights switched on at 8 A.M. and off at 8 P.M.).Food and tap water were available ad libitum.Measurement of VB6 in mouse plasma and brain tissue After feeding with the VB6-lacking diet for 4 weeks, mice were sacri ﬁced, and their brains removed.The prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, nucleus accum-bens, and striatum (STR) were dissected on an ice-coldglass plate.Each brain region was rapidly frozen andstored at −80 °C until further analysis.VB6 concentration in plasma were determined with ID- Vit VB6 (Immunodiagnostik AG: Bensheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer ’s protocol.The VB6 score measured by this kit contains all forms of VB6 (PL, PN,and PM) and their phosphorylated forms (PLP, PNP,and PMP).
The concentrations of VB6 in the brain were deter- mined using an Agilent 1260 In ﬁnity HPLC system, which was equipped with an Agilent 1100 series ﬂuorescence detector (Agilent technologies, CA). Brie ﬂy, each frozen brain sample was weighed and homogenized with an ultrasonic processor in 28.6 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.5)containing 20% acetonitrile and 2.86% tri ﬂuoroacetic acidwith 4 ′-deoxypyridoxine as an internal standard.The homogenates were then placed on ice for 20 min andcentrifuged at 9100x gfor 5 min at 4 °C.The supernatants were ﬁltered using Ultrafree ®-MC Centrifugal Filter Units (DURAPORE PVDF, 0.22 μm, Merck, Germany) and injected into the HPLC system with a CAPCELL PAK C18ADME separation column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, OsakaSoda, Osaka, Japan).The mobile phase consisted of abinary gradient elution pro ﬁle comprising 10 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 3.0) with 10 mM sodium-1-octanesulfonate and acetonitrile.The ﬂow rate was maintained at a constant of 1 mL/min.
The column temperature was set at 40 °C, and the detection wave-length was set at 400 nm with excitation at 290 nm. Measurement of monoamine levels in brain The level of monoamines and their metabolites were determined using a HPLC system, which was equippedwith an electrochemical detector (HITEC500; Eicom, Kyoto, Japan) as previously described 9,10.Each frozen brain sample was weighed and homogenized with anultrasonic processor in 0.2 M perchloric acid containingisoproterenol as an internal standard.The homogenateswere then placed on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at20,000 xgfor 15 min at 4 °C.The supernatants were mixed with 1 M sodium acetate, pH 3.0, ﬁltrated with 0.22 μm ﬁlter (Merck Millipore), and injected into a HPLC system equipped with a reversed-phase ODS column (Eicompak SC-5ODS; 150 mm × 2.1 mm; Eicom) and an electro-chemical detector.The column temperature was main-tained at 25 °C, and the detector potential was set at+750 mV.
The mobile phase was 0.1 M citric acid and 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 3.6, containing 14% methanol,180 mg/L sodium-1-octanesulfonate, and 5 mg/L EDTA,and the ﬂow rate was set at 1 mL/min. The monoamine turnover was calculated from the concentrations of each monoamine and their metabolites.In vivo microdialysis After feeding with VB6-lacking diet for 4 weeks, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and stereotaxically implanted with a dialysis probe (D-I-4-02: 2 mm membrane length; Eicom) in the PFC (AP +1.7 mm, ML −0.3 mm, DV −3.5 mm, from the bregma) and the STR (AP +8.0 mm, ML −1.5 mm, DV −4.0 mm, from the bregma) 11.The cannula was cemented in place with dental acrylic resin.Microdialysis experiments wereconducted the day after surgery.The probe was perfusedwith Ringer ’s solution [147 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, and 2.3 mM CaCl 2(pH 6.0)] at a constant ﬂow rate of 1μL/min.A stabilization period of 3 h was established before depolarization stimulation.
Microdialysis samples (20μL) were collected every 20 min and injected imme- diately onto a HPLC column for simultaneous assaying ofToriumi et al. Translational Psychiatry (2021) 11:262 Page 2 of 11 monoamines.The concentrations of monoamines in brain microdialysates were determined by HPLC with an elec-trochemical detector (HTEC-500; Eicom).An Eicompak CAX column (2.0 mm × 200 mm; Eicom) was used, and the potential of the graphite electrode (WE-3G; Eicom)was set to +450 mV against an Ag/AgCl reference elec- trode.The mobile phase contained 100 mM phosphatebuffer (pH 6.0), 500 mg/L sodium-1-octanesulfonate,50 mg/L EDTA and 30% (vol/vol) methanol, and the ﬂow rate was set at 1 mL/min.Three time points were chosenfor measurements to establish baseline levels of extra- cellular neurotransmitter.
For depolarization stimulation, Ringer ’s solution containing high K +[51 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, and 2.3 mM CaCl 2(pH 6.0)] was delivered through the dialysis probe for 20 min to measure theK +-evoked release of monoamines. Social interaction test Twelve-week-old male mice were tested for social behavior using the three-chamber social approach para- digm.The apparatus was a square ﬁeld (W50 × D50 × H40 cm) that is divided into three chambers of equal sizeby gray walls, which was placed in a dark, sound-attenuated room.During a habituation session, twoempty wire cages were placed in the lateral chambers.Themice were placed in the center chamber and allowed tofreely explore all chambers for 10 min.Immediately after the habituation session, the mouse was placed in a home cage for 3 min.
After the interval, a test session started.The mice were placed in the center chamber again andallowed to freely explore the left and right arenas, whichcontained a social target (unfamiliar C57BL/6J malemouse) in one chamber and empty in the other chamber.Experimental mice were given 10 min to explore bothchambers. The amount of time spent in the lateral chambers and the time spent within 3 cm around the circular wire cage as interaction time was recorded andanalyzed by EthoVision tracking system (Noldus,Netherland).Novel object recognition test The novel object recognition test was performed as described previously with minor modi ﬁcations12.The test procedure consisted of three sessions: habituation, training, and retention.Each mouse was individuallyhabituated to the box, with 10 min of exploration in theabsence of objects each day for 3 consecutive days (Day1–3) (habituation session).
On day 4, each animal was allowed to explore the box for 10 min, in which two novelobjects were placed symmetrically. The time spentexploring each object was recorded (training session).The objects were different in shape and color, but similar in size.Mice were considered to be exploring an objectwhen their heads were facing it or when they weresnifﬁng it at a distance of less than 2 cm and/or touching it with their nose.After the training session, mice wereimmediately returned to their home cages.On day 5, the animals were placed back into the same box with one of the familiar objects used in the training session and onenovel object.Mice were allowed to explore freely for5 min and the time spent exploring each object wasrecorded (retention session).The time when the mouse isin contact with the object is checked visually by theobserver and recorded as exploratory time.
An explora-tory preference, the ratio of time spent exploring either of the two objects (training session) or the novel object (retention session) over the total amount of time spentexploring both objects, was used to assess recognitionmemory. Intracerebroventricular treatment with PLP by osmotic pump After feeding with VB6-lacking diet for 3 weeks, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus.The infusioncannula was connected to a osmotic pump (Alzet 1002;ALZET, CA) ﬁlled with PLP in SAL (1.5 ng/ μl) and was implanted into the right ventricle (AP +0.45 mm, ML 1.0 mm, DV −2.5 mm, from the bregma and skull) 11.PLP were continuously infused into the cerebral ventricle at adose of 9 ng/6 μl per day ( ﬂow rate, 0.25 μl/h).Addition- ally, SAL was used as a control.One week after the start of PLP infusion, novel object recognition test and socialinteraction test were conducted.
Guanfacine treatment GFC (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Tokyo, Japan) dissolved in saline (SAL) wa s administered (1.0 mg/kg/ day, s.c.) to VB6( −) and control mice during the last week of feeding with VB6( −) or control diet respec- tively. Mice were treated with GFC 2 h before thetraining and retention se ssions in the novel object recognition test and the habituation session in the socialinteraction test.Statistical analysis Statistical differences between two groups were deter- mined with a Student ’st-test.Statistical differences between more than three groups were determined using aone-way or two-way ANOVA with repeated measuresfollowed by Bonferroni ’s multiple comparison test.A two- sided F-test con ﬁrmed normally distributed data.The statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prismversion 7.0.Sample size was estimated based on ourprevious studies.Behavioral experiments were performed by experimenters blind to the group of the animals.Results are reported as mean ± SEM.
A value of p< 0.05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant.Toriumi et al. Translational Psychiatry (2021) 11:262 Page 3 of 11 Study approval In animal studies, the experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science (approval no.15001, 16001, 17003, 18006, and 19003).Results VB6-de ﬁcient mice were generated by feeding with VB6- lacking diet VB6 is not synthesized de novo in humans, but is pri- marily obtained from foods13,14.We generated VB6( −) mice by feeding with a VB6-lacking diet containing low VB6 at 5 μg/100 g pellets from 8 to 12 weeks of age, while control mice were fed with a normal diet in which VB6 ispresent at 1.4 mg/100 g.This VB6-lacking diet reducedbody growth without a change in food intake (Fig.1A, B).Moreover, we con ﬁrmed that plasma VB6 level in VB6( −) mice [2.62 ± 0.22 ng/ml] decreased to 2.9% of the controlgroup [89.3 ± 3.70 ng/ml] (Fig.1C).
Despite the remark- able reduction in plasma VB6, PLP in the brain of VB6( −) mice was modestly reduced to 60 –70% of control level, and PMP in VB6( −) mice was not signi ﬁcantly changed compared with control mice (Fig. 1D, E).Interestingly, PLP and PMP levels were 50 –70% and 80 –90% of control levels respectively, even after feeding with the VB6-lacking diet for 8 weeks (Supplementary Fig.S1).Theseﬁndings suggest a mechanism to actively import and maintain VB6 in the brain.Behavioral abnormalities in VB6-de ﬁcient mice Next, we assessed behavioral performances of VB6( −) mice to evaluate the effect of VB6 de ﬁciency on schizophrenia-like behaviors.In a social interaction testusing a three-chamber apparatus, VB6( −) mice spent less time in the chamber with an unfamiliar mouse and had decreased interaction time during the test session com- pared with control mice (Fig.1F, G).
Using a novel object recognition test, to investigate recognition memory,VB6(−) mice showed decreased exploratory preference during the retention session compared with control mice,although there was no change in exploratory time(Fig. 1H, I).These data demonstrate that VB6( −) mice dis- play behavioral de ﬁcits of sociability and cognitive memory.Monoamines in the brain of VB6-de ﬁcient mice To investigate whether VB6 de ﬁciency affects the function of monoaminergic neuronal systems, mono-amines and their metabolites were measured in variousregions of the brain.Almost no changes were observed inDA, 5-HT, and NA across all brain regions, although NAwas increased in the STR of VB6( −) mice (Fig.2A–C).We also quanti ﬁed amino acids in the brain of VB6( −) mice and there were almost no changes, except for glu-tamate, aspartate, and alanine in the STR (SupplementaryFig.2A –G).
Furthermore, to determine functional alterations in the monoaminergic neuronal system,monoamine turnover was evaluated by calculating the ratio of the total tissue monoamine level to monoamine metabolite level. Although there were no changes in DAand 5-HT turnover in all brain regions, NA turnoverrepresented by the ratio of MHPG to NA remarkablyincreased in the PFC, nucleus accumbens and hippo-campus of VB6( −) mice (Fig.2D–F), which was due to a signi ﬁcant increase of MHPG throughout the brain (Fig.2G).These ﬁndings suggest that the activities of NAergic neuronal systems are enhanced in VB6( −) mice.Monoamines release in the PFC and STR of VB6-de ﬁcient mice To con ﬁrm whether NAergic signaling in VB6( −) mice is altered, we evaluated NA release after high K+exposure using microdialysis.
We analyzed the NA release in theSTR where the increased NA content was observed and the PFC as a number of reports have suggested that the NAergic neuronal system in the PFC is enhanced inpatients with schizophrenia 15–17. We found no change in basal levels of extracellular NA in both the PFC and theSTR of VB6( −) mice (Fig.3A, C).However, NA release in both the PFC and the STR of VB6( −) mice after high K + stimulation was signi ﬁcantly increased compared to control mice (Fig.3B, D).These ﬁndings suggest that VB6 deﬁciency activates NAergic signaling widely in the brain, which is consistent with the results indicating anenhanced NA metabolism (Fig.2F, G).Furthermore, we also found enhanced DA release in the STR of VB6( −) mice, although no changes in DA release in the PFC and in 5-HT release in both regions (Supple-mentary Fig.S3).However, we also found that the VB6( −) mice showed no hyperlocomotion and no PPI de ﬁcits (Supplementary Fig.S2).
Additionally, the VB6( −) mice also showed no change in DA contents and DA turnoverin the STR (Fig. 2A, D).These ﬁndings suggest that the enhanced DA release in the STR might be insuf ﬁcient to induce the behavioral de ﬁcits in the VB6( −) mice.Rescue of behavioral de ﬁcits in VB6-de ﬁcient mice by PLP supplementation into the brain Next, to demonstrate whether VB6 supplementation can rescue the NAergic and behavioral changes observedin the VB6-de ﬁcient mice and whether the changes are due to VB6 de ﬁciency in the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS), mice were chronically i.c.v.treated withPLP by osmotic pump.The osmotic pump was implantedafter feeding with VB6-lacking diet for 3 weeks.One weekafter the operation, novel object recognition test and social interaction test were conducted.The VB6 supplementation into the CNS suppressed theenhanced NA turnover (Fig.4B) and improved theToriumi et al.
Translational Psychiatry (2021) 11:262 Page 4 of 11 behavioral de ﬁcits in the VB6( −) mice (Fig. 4C, D), but it could not rescue the reduced body growth (Fig.4A).These ﬁndings suggest that the enhanced NA turnover and the behavioral de ﬁcits shown in the VB6-de ﬁcient mice are attributed to VB6 de ﬁciency in the CNS, and the reduced body growth is due to that in the peripheral.Improvement of behavioral de ﬁcits in VB6-de ﬁcient mice with GFC treatment To uncover whether the VB6 de ﬁciency-induced beha- vioral de ﬁcits resulted from enhancement of the NAergic signaling, mice were administrated a selective α2A adre- noreceptor agonist, GFC (which suppresses NA releaseControl VB6(-)0102030Food Intake [g/week]n.s.0 7 14 21 2823242526272829 DayBody Weight [g]Control VB6(-) *** *** Control VB6(-)0255075100125Plasma VB6 [mg/L]*** AB C PFC NAC STR HIP0.00.51.01.52.0PLP contents [ng/mg tissue]** ******* PFC NAC STR HIP01234PMP contents [ng/mg tissue]n.s.

In the social interaction test, GFC nor- malized the time spent in the chamber with an unfamiliar mouse in the VB6( −) mice, while GFC also signi ﬁcantly reduced locomotor activity (Fig. 5B, C).Moreover, in thenovel object recognition test, GFC normalized explora- tory preference in VB6( −) mice.However, the explora- tory time in the training session was decreased, probablydue to the decrease in locomotor activity (Fig.5D, E).These results show that the behavioral de ﬁcits in VB6( −) mice may be caused by an enhancement of NAergicsignaling.PFC NAC STR HIP05101520Dopamine [ng/mg tissue]n.s.PFC NAC STR HIP0.00.20.40.6Noradrenaline [ng/mg tissue]* PFC NAC STR HIP PFC NAC STR HIP PFC NAC STR HIP0.00.51.01.52.02.5Dopamine Turnover DOPAC/DA HVA/DA 3-MT/DAn.s.PFC NAC STR HIP PFC NAC STR HIP024Noradrenaline Turnover MHPG/NA NM/NAn.d.*********PFC NAC STR HIP0.00.20.40.60.81.0Serotonine [ng/mg tissue]n.s.PFC NAC STR HIP0.00.51.01.5Serotonine Turnover 5-HIAA/5-HTn.s.

However, VB6 level at less than 2.0 ng/mlcould not be quanti ﬁed (not detected) due to a detection limitation in the VB6 measurement system. Several patients with schizophrenia showed “not detected, ”indi- cating that there are at least some patients who havemarkedly decreased to less than 2.0 ng/ml (<20% control),although our results cannot show the existence of patientswhose VB6 has been reduced to 0.3 ng/ml.Additionally,since blood levels of VB6 in control mice are about 8.75times higher than in humans, it may be dif ﬁcult to simply compare the de ﬁciency rates between mice and humans.VB6(−) mice also showed decreased growth without a change in food intake (Fig.1A, B), which agrees with previous studies 18,19.This ﬁnding suggests that VB6 deﬁciency induces metabolic abnormalities.In mammals, 70–80% of VB6 in the body is associated with glycogen phosphorylase in the skeletal muscle20.
VB6 is a cofactor for glycogen phosphorylase in the liver and muscle which catalyzes the sequential phosphorolysis of glycogen to release glucose-1-phosphate21. Thus, it is suggested that VB6 de ﬁciency might decrease glucose levels in the per- ipheral blood via inhibition of glycogen phosphorylaseand this may prevent growth.VB6 de ﬁciency was reported to decrease activity of glycogen phosphorylase 22, and administration of inhibitors against the glycogen phos-phorylase reduces glucose level in the blood in humans 23.The hypothesis is consistent with our ﬁndings that the weight loss caused by VB6 de ﬁciency can be explained by its effect on the periphery (Fig.4A).Despite the signi ﬁcant reduction in the plasma, PLP, and PMP levels in the brain of VB6( −) mice showed only either a modest decline to 60 –70% (PLP) of control levels or no change (PMP) (Fig.1D, E).
Even though feeding with the VB6-lacking diet lasted for 8 weeks, PLP and PMP were decreased to only 50 –70% and 80 –90% of the control group, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1).These results imply there is a mechanism to maintain VB6levels in the brain, although this remains unclear.VB6(−) mice exhibited impairment in social behavior, cognition and memory comparable with the negativesymptoms and cognitive impairment seen in patients withschizophrenia (Fig.1F–I), which is ameliorated by the α2A receptor agonist GFC (Fig.5).Furthermore, we found a signi ﬁcant increase in MHPG in whole brain tissue in VB6(−) mice, resulting in a remarkably increased NA turnover (Fig.2).The enhanced NA release in the PFC and the STR of VB6( −) mice was directly demonstrated by in vivo microdialysis (Fig.3).
Additionally, we demonstrated that chronic supple- mentation of VB6 into the CNS by osmotic pump rescued the enhanced NA metabolism and subsequently improved the behavioral de ﬁcits in VB6( −) mice (Fig. 4).These ﬁndings demonstrate that VB6 de ﬁciency in the CNS, notin the peripheral, increases NAergic signaling in some brain regions, which might induce schizophrenia-likebehavioral de ﬁcits.As such, the NAergic system may be hyperactivated in patients with schizophrenia who have low VB6 levels, causing negative symptoms and cognitivedysfunction.On the other hand, we found no changes inGABA, DA, and 5-HT in the brains of VB6( −) mice although these neurotransmitters are synthesized by VB6-dependent enzymes (Fig.2and Supplementary Fig.S4).These ﬁndings may indicate that moderately decreased VB6 in the brain is suf ﬁcient to maintain the level of these neurotransmitters.
However, modest decline in VB6 is sufﬁcient to impair the NAergic neuronal system, sug- gesting that the NAergic system might be more vulnerableto VB6 de ﬁciency compared to other neuronal systems. To identify molecular mechanisms underlying ourobserved ﬁnding that VB6 de ﬁciency increases NAergic signaling, further experiments including gene expressionanalysis would be required on that point.Early clinical studies have shown that elevated NA sig- naling plays a pathophysiological role in schizophrenia15–17.A number of studies reported that MHPG level in theblood can be used as a biomarker for schizophrenia.MHPG was increased in the blood in patients with schi-zophrenia compared to healthy subjects, which declinedafter treatment with neuroleptics 24–26.
A clinical study also showed that NA and MHPG levels correlated both with the severity of negative symptoms and with psychosis ratings in drug-free patients with schizophrenia27.I na rodent study, the majority of the plasma MHPG (~83%) isderived from neuronal metabolism of NA 28, suggesting that the plasma MHPG is largely dependent on neuralactivity of the NAergic system. Therefore, the increasedplasma MHPG observed in patients with schizophreniaimplies enhancement of the NAergic system, which is consistent with the ﬁndings in the current study.There- fore, similar to MHPG, VB6 level in the peripheral bloodmight be useful as a biomarker for schizophrenia.In fact,a recent review has shown the decreased VB6 in patientswith schizophrenia as the most convincing evidence inperipheral biomarkers for major mental disorders 29.High concentrations of NA were reported to cause PFC dysfunction via activation of α1 and β1 adrenor- eceptors30,31.
In fact, microinjection of antagonists for both the α1 and β1 receptor (urapidil and betaxolol, respectively) into the PFC improved cognitive dysfunctioninduced by hyperactivation of NAergic signaling 30,31.I n the present study, GFC treatment is suggested to inhibitthe excessive NA release in the PFC of VB6( −) mice by blockade of presynaptic α2A adrenoreceptors, as demonstrated by normalization of NA turnover (Fig. 5A).Therefore, stimulation of both α1 and β1 receptor might be mitigated by GFC treatment, leading to a normal-ization of the behavioral de ﬁcits seen in untreated VB6( −)Toriumi et al.Translational Psychiatry (2021) 11:262 Page 9 of 11 mice.In addition, GFC can stimulate the postsynaptic α2A adrenoreceptor as well, which is the pharmacological mechanism of GFC when used therapeutically for atten- tion de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)32.
As a result of the effect of GFC on hyperactivity, GFC may havereduced the locomotor activity of VB6( −) mice in the behavioral tests used in this study (Fig. 5B).In contrast to α1 and β1 receptors, many studies have reported that stimulation of the postsynaptic α2A receptor has a ben- eﬁcial effect on PFC performance 33–42.Activation of the postsynaptic α2A receptor can prevent the production of cAMP, leading to the closure of hyperpolarization- activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) cation channels.The blockade of HCN channels in the PFC seems toimprove the PFC mediated cognitive performance andstrengthens delay-related ﬁring of PFC neurons 43.As well as suppression of the α1 and β1 receptors resulting from the inhibition of NA release, GFC is suggested to stimu-late the postsynaptic α2A receptor, which may also play a role in rescuing the behavioral de ﬁcits in VB6( −) mice.
It has previously been reported that GFC treatmentimproved cognitive impairment in patients with schizo-phrenia 44and context processing, a feature of working memory in schizotypal personality disorder45. Our ﬁnd- ings suggest that GFC might be effective in patients withschizophrenia who have low VB6 levels in peripheralblood.Additionally, supplemental treatment of PM could also be therapeutically bene ﬁcial in patients with low VB6, as we reported previously 8.The subgroup of the patients with schizophrenia may experience a more prolonged and mild decrease in VB6,and thus the effects on the nervous system may be dif-ferent.Our VB6( −) mice is a model of acute VB6 deple- tion, and we believe that it represents the effects ofdecreased VB6 in a more pronounced manner.In other words, in patients with schizophrenia, the NA system is likely to be more mildly enhanced and the other long-term effects of VB6 de ﬁciency may be arisen additionally.
The effects of VB6 de ﬁciency would need to be considered carefully, taking into account the degree and duration ofVB6 de ﬁciency. In conclusion, we have demonstrated by generating VB6 (−) mice that VB6 de ﬁciency enhanced NAergic signaling.VB6(−) mice also displayed behavioral impairments, which were ameliorated by VB6 supplementation into theCNS and treatment of α2A adrenoreceptor agonist GFC.Acknowledgements We thank the donors and their families for the samples used in these studies.We are grateful for the expert technical assistance of Izumi Nohara, Yukiko Shimada, Emiko Hama, Nanako Obata, Mai Hatakenaka, Chikako Ishida, and Ikuyo Kito.
