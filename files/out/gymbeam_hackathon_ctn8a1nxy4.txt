Hence, the current study investigates the synthesis of novel magnesium borate/magnesium oxide (Mg 3B2O6/MgO) nanostructures and their efficiency in removing methylene blue dye from aqueous media.
The nanostructures were synthesized using the Pechini sol–gel method, which involves a reaction between magnesium nitrate hexahydrate and boric acid, with citric acid acting as a chelating agent and ethylene glycol as a crosslinker. This method helps in achieving a homogeneous mixture, which, upon calcination at 600 and 800◦C, yields Mg 3B2O6/MgO novel nanostructures referred to as MB600 and MB800, respectively.The characterization of these nanostructures involved techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, N 2gas analyzer, and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM).These analyses confirmed the formation of orthorhombic Mg 3B2O6and cubic MgO phases with distinct features, influenced by the calcination temperature.The mean crystal size of the MB600 and MB800 samples was 64.57 and 79.20 nm, respectively.In addition, the BET surface area of the MB600 and MB800 samples was 74.63 and 64.82 m2/g, respectively.
The results indicated that the MB600 sample, with its higher surface area, generally demonstrated better methylene blue dye removal performance (505.05 mg/g) than the MB800 sample (483.09 mg/g). The adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order model, indicating dependency on available adsorption sites.Also, the adsorption process matched well with the Langmuir isotherm, confirming a homogeneous adsorbent surface.The thermodynamic parameters revealed that the adsorption process was physical, exothermic, and spontaneous.The MB600 and MB800 nanostructures could be effectively regenerated using 6 M HCl and reused across multiple cycles.These findings underscore the potential of these nanostructures as cost-effective and sustainable adsorbents for methylene blue dye removal.Keywords: Mg 3B2O6/MgO nanostructures; adsorption; methylene blue dye; analytical influences 1.
Introduction Water pollution with organic dyes is predominantly caused by industrial discharges, specifically from sectors such as textiles, leather, paper, and plastics [ 1–3]. These industries frequently use synthetic dyes to color their products and often discharge untreated or inadequately treated effluents into water bodies.This contamination is exacerbated by insufficient regulatory frameworks, inadequate waste management systems, and a lack of awareness about the environmental impacts of dye effluents.Organic dyes impose significant risks to both ecological and human health.Environmentally, these dyes can Molecules 2024 ,29, 3392.https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29143392 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules Molecules 2024 ,29, 3392 2 of 22 severely affect aquatic life by reducing light penetration and oxygen levels in water bodies, thus disturbing aquatic ecosystems [ 4,5].From a human health perspective, many organic dyes contain carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic compounds.
For example, exposure to certain azo dyes has been linked to bladder cancer and other health issues [ 6,7]. Methy- lene blue, a commonly used organic dye in various industries, is particularly dangerous to human health.Although used medically for certain treatments, its presence in water at high concentrations can cause significant health issues such as increased heart rate, vomiting, diarrhea, and methemoglobinemia—a condition in which oxygen delivery to tissues is impaired [ 8–10].The removal of organic dyes from water can be achieved through various methods, such as adsorption [ 11,12], electrochemical processes [ 13], photocatalytic degradation [ 14], and biological processes [ 15].Adsorption is usually preferred for dye dis- posal because of its simplicity, cost effectiveness, and high efficiency, especially at low dye concentrations.Unlike other methods, adsorption does not result in secondary pollution and can be effective across a wide range of pH and temperature conditions.
It also allows for the possibility of regenerating the adsorbent, further enhancing its economic viability. The adsorption method is particularly important over other dye removal techniques due to its low energy requirements, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective option for treating water contaminated with organic dyes [ 16–18].Nanometal oxides are particularly effective in the uptake of organic dyes because of their high surface area and unique chemi- cal properties.These materials can interact strongly with dye molecules, leading to higher removal efficiencies [ 19–22].Chen et al.investigated the synthesis and application of a novel Bi 2MoO 6hierarchical microsphere adsorbent.The adsorbent was highly effective in removing organic pollutants such as methylene blue and Congo red from aqueous solu- tions [ 23].Also, Chen et al.
developed a highly efficient and recyclable Bi 2O2CO 3(BOC) adsorbent modified with surfactants such as hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), achieving superior performance in removing methyl orange dye and Cr(VI) ions. The BOC-CTAB variant demonstrated the highest ad- sorption capacity, with simple regeneration via photodegradation [ 24].The Pechini sol–gel process is crucial for preparing high-quality metal nanooxides.This method allows for precise control over the chemical composition and structure of the resulting nanomaterials, leading to optimized properties for specific applications like dye adsorption.The method involves using a chelating agent like citric acid to bind metal ions and a crosslinker like ethylene glycol to play a crucial role in enhancing the network structure, facilitating the formation of uniform and highly pure metal oxides [ 21,22].
The current research introduces an innovative aspect through the synthesis of novel Mg 3B2O6/MgO nanostructures using the Pechini sol–gel technique. The use of citric acid as a chelating reagent and ethylene glycol as a crosslinker helps in forming nanostructures that are more effective in adsorbing dyes due to their increased surface area.The application of these novel nanostructures to remove methylene blue dye from aqueous solutions represents a significant innovation.These structures have shown superior performance in removing methylene blue from aque- ous solutions, demonstrating high adsorption capacities and the potential for reuse after regeneration, highlighting their practical applicability in environmental cleanup efforts.This research not only contributes to the field of water purification but also advances our understanding of material science in creating efficient and sustainable solutions to pressing environmental problems.2.Results and Discussion 2.1.
Synthesis and Characterization of Mg 3B2O6/MgO Nanostructures The Pechini sol–gel technique for synthesizing Mg 3B2O6/MgO nanostructures in- volves a series of chemical reactions and process steps using citric acid as a chelating reagent, ethylene glycol as a crosslinker, magnesium nitrate hexahydrate as a magnesium source, and boric acid as a boron source. Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate and boric acid are dissolved in water.The magnesium nitrate dissociates to provide Mg2+ions, and Molecules 2024 ,29, 3392 3 of 22 boric acid reacts with water to form the tetrahydroxyborate ion, B(OH) 4−, as shown in Equations (1) and (2): Mg(NO 3)2·6H2O→Mg2++ 2NO 3−+ 6H 2O (1) H3BO3+ H 2O→B(OH) 4−+ H+(2) Citric acid is added to the aqueous solution containing Mg2+and B(OH) 4−.Citric acid chelates both magnesium and boron ions, forming a complex.
This complexation improves the homogeneity of the metal ion distribution and enhances the stability of the precursor solution, as shown in Equation (3): Mg2++ B(OH) 4−+ C 6H8O7→[MgB(Citrate)] complex + 4H 2O (3) Ethylene glycol is then added to the solution to act as a crosslinking agent [ 25]. It reacts with the carboxyl groups of the citrate in the metal complex, leading to the formation of ester linkages.This polymerization forms a dense and stable gel, which traps the metal ions uniformly throughout the matrix.The viscous gel that forms is then dried.This step removes water and begins to solidify the complex, preparing it for heat treatment.Upon calcination at high temperatures, the organic components of the gel (citrate and ethylene glycol-based polymers) decompose, and the metal ions react to form the desired mixed oxides.
The high temperature facilitates the decomposition of the organic matrix and the formation of magnesium borate (Mg 3B2O6) and magnesium oxide (MgO), as shown in Equation (4). Polymeric Network + heat →Mg 3B2O6+ MgO + CO 2+ H 2O (4) In the conducted study, the XRD characterization of nanostructures synthesized by the Pechini sol–gel process at 600 and 800◦C was examined, as clarified in Figure 1A,B, respectively.The samples labeled MB600 and MB800 were primarily composed of Mg 3B2O6 (orthorhombic system, JCPDS No.00-038-1475) and MgO (cubic system, JCPDS No.01- 086-8571), as clarified in Figure 1C.It was observed that a rise in the synthesis temperature from 600◦C to 800◦C led to a notable increment in the average crystal size from 64.57 nm to 79.20 nm.These average crystal sizes were calculated by the Scherrer formula [ 26].This suggests that the thermal conditions under which the composites were synthesized played a significant role in influencing the crystal growth processes.
The higher temperature likely facilitated more energy for the atoms to migrate and arrange into a more stable crystalline structure, resulting in larger crystal sizes. The 2 θ◦(hkl) values of 21.11◦(020), 22.39◦ (011), 25.71◦(101), 27.91◦(111), 33.52◦(121), 36.09◦(130), 38.93◦(201), 40.39◦(211), 41.39◦ (131), 42.87◦(040), 50.77◦(141), 52.88◦(202), 54.99◦(132), 56.09◦(311), 57.29◦(150), 58.57◦ (051), 59.49◦(321), 61.24◦(330), 66.65◦(060), and 68.85◦(251) correspond to the Mg 3B2O6 orthorhombic phase.Similarly, for the MgO phase, the cubic structure was confirmed by the appearance of 2 θ◦(hkl) values at 36.99◦(111) and 62.15◦(220).Figure 2 describes the N 2adsorption/desorption isotherms of the MB600 and MB800 samples, respectively.Analysis of the data reveals that both MB600 and MB800 surface textures exhibited type IV isotherms with distinct hysteresis loops, indicative of mesoporous structures.
The BET surface area and total pore volume, as reflected in Table 1, were slightly reduced from MB600 to MB800, with respective values of 74.63 m2/g to 64.82 m2/g and 0.2568 cm3/g to 0.2186 cm3/g. This suggests that the thermal treatment corresponding to MB800 may lead to a minor collapse or blockage of pores, thereby reducing the accessible surface area and pore volume [ 27].Notably, the mean pore size remained relatively unchanged, with a negligible decrease from 6.88 nm for MB600 to 6.75 nm for MB800.This minor reduction might be attributed to the aforementioned structural alterations.Molecules 2024 ,29, 3392 4 of 22 Molecules 2024, 29, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 23 Figure 1.XRD analysis of the MB600 (A ) and MB800 (B ) nanostructures.Standard XRD patterns of Mg 3B2O6 and MgO phases ( C).Figure 1.XRD analysis of the MB600 ( A) and MB800 ( B) nanostructures.Standard XRD patterns of Mg 3B2O6and MgO phases ( C).

Analysis of the equilibrium data revealed that the Langmuir isotherm provided a better fit than the Freundlich isotherm, as evidenced by higher R2val- ues of 0.9966 and 0.9896 for both adsorbents in the Langmuir isotherm compared to 0.7398 and 0.7362 in the Freundlich isotherm for the MB600 and MB800 adsorbents, respectively. In the presented study, the adsorption capacities of various adsorbents toward methy- lene blue dye were compared, as summarized in Table 5 [ 31–38].Among the evaluated adsorbents, the highest adsorption capacity was observed for MB600, with a value of 505.05 mg/g, closely followed by MB800, which exhibited a capacity of 483.09 mg/g.These values were significantly higher when compared to other adsorbents.The superior per- formance of the newly studied MB600 and MB800 adsorbents suggests their potential for enhanced dye removal in wastewater treatment applications.
These findings highlight the ongoing advancements in adsorbent technology and the critical role of material engineering in environmental remediation efforts. The enhanced adsorption capacities can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between Mg 3B2O6and MgO.Mg 3B2O6provides a high surface area and mesoporosity, facilitating dye molecules’ access to active sites.Meanwhile, MgO contributes to structural stability and provides additional active sites for adsorption.This combination results in a material with superior adsorption characteristics compared to the Molecules 2024 ,29, 3392 15 of 22 individual components alone.The interaction between these phases enhances the overall performance by optimizing the available surface area, pore structure, and adsorption sites, leading to higher removal efficiencies.Molecules 2024, 29, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 23 Figure 12.

Effect of Regeneration and Reusability In the current work, the effectiveness of different concentrations of HCl as an eluting agent for the desorption of methylene blue dye from the MB600 and MB800 adsorbents was evaluated, as shown in Figure 13.It was found that, as the concentration of HCl improved, the percentage of dye desorbed also increased for both types of adsorbents.The highest desorption efficiency was achieved at a concentration of 6 M, where the desorption percentages were 98.82% for the MB600 adsorbent and 99.03% for the MB800 adsorbent.
These results suggest that the desorption capacity is powerfully dependent on the acidity of the eluting solution. The higher desorption percentages at increased HCl concentrations can be attributed to the enhanced disruption of interactions between the methylene blue dye molecules and the adsorbent surfaces.The near-complete desorption at the highest concentration highlights the potential for regenerating and reusing these adsorbents.This study emphasizes the importance of optimizing eluent concentration for effective dye recovery and adsorbent reuse.The findings indicate that both MB600 and MB800 adsorbents exhibit excellent potential for cyclic usage with effective desorption capabilities.The reusability of the MB600 and MB800 adsorbents for the removal of methylene blue dye was systematically investigated over several cycles, as shown in Figure 14.
The re- moval percentage remained relatively stable over five cycles, indicating that the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbents was not significantly affected by repeated use.

The beginning pH values (pH i) of 50 mL of KCl solutions were adjusted and recorded before adding 0.1 g of the adsorbent.After 12 hrs of stirring, the final pH values (pH f) of the solutions were recorded.The difference between the final and initial pH values ( ∆pH) was plotted against the initial pH values (pH i).Hence, the point at which the plot of ∆pH versus pH icrosses the horizontal axis indicates the pH PZC.4.Conclusions This study explores the synthesis of innovative magnesium borate/magnesium oxide (Mg 3B2O6/MgO) nanostructures and evaluates their effectiveness in removing methylene blue dye from aqueous media.
The nanostructures were produced using the Pechini sol– gel method, a process involving a reaction between boric acid and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, with citric acid as a chelating agent and ethylene glycol as a crosslinker. The nanostructures, which were produced at 600 and 800◦C, were labeled as MB600 and MB800, respectively.Also, the average crystal sizes of the MB600 and MB800 samples were 64.57 and 79.20 nm, respectively.In addition, the BET surface areas of the MB600 and MB800 products were 74.63 and 64.82 m2/g, respectively.Results showed that the MB600 sample, with a higher surface area, typically outperformed the MB800 in methylene blue dye removal, achieving adsorption capacities of 505.05 and 483.09 mg/g, respectively.Both MB600 and MB800 nanostructures were successfully regenerated using 6 M HCl and showed high reusability over multiple cycles.
These results highlight the potential of these nanostructures as economical and sustainable adsorbents for methylene blue dye removal.
