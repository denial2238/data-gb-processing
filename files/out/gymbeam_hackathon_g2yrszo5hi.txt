Anemia caused by a lack of iron–folic acid is a worldwide public health problem, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). During pregnancy and post-pregnancy, iron–folic acid is a vital micronutrient for physiological function, growth, and development, as well as for maintaining life for the mother and the fetus ( 2).Increased iron–folic acid supplementation during pregnancy helps decrease the risk of anemia, hemorrhage, sepsis, maternal mortality, and productivity ( 3).However, if provided an excess of iron folic acid may cause peroxidative damage through production of reactive oxygen species including loss of functional integrity, and decreased turnover of epithelial cells, as also with marked mucosalcelldeath( 4–6).In sub-Saharan Africa, the overall prevalence of at least 90 days of iron supplementation during pregnancy was 28.7%, ranging from 1.4% in Burundi to 73.0% in Senegal ( 7).
According to the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) of 2005, 2011, and 2016, <0.1, 1.1, and 5.1% of pregnant women, respectively, used IFA supplements for the recommended period during their pregnancy (pregnant women should take approximately 30–60-mg IFA during their pregnancy) ( 8–10). Diﬀerent studies carried out in Ethiopia based on self-reported adherences showed that ∼38.3–47.6% of pregnant women were adherent to recommended IFA supplementation( 11–13).

Despite this intervention strategy, according to the Mini EDHS 2019, the prevalence of iron supplementadherencewasonly11%,whichwasfartoolow( 15).Miscarriage,stillbirths,preterm,lowbirthweight,congenital deformities, and perinatal mortality are some risks of iron– folic acid deﬁciency during pregnancy ( 16,17).
According to a systematic review, iron–folic acid supplementation could minimize50%ofirondeﬁciencyanemiainpregnantwomenand reducetheriskoflowbirthweightby19%( 18). Iron deﬁciency anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in pregnant women and children worldwide, particularlyinLMICs.Lowintakeofiron–folicacidsupplement during pregnancy has been linked to a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes such as neural tube defects, cardiac defects, and endocrine disorders.Iron–folic acid supplementation is the currently recommended strategy to prevent the adverse outcomes ( 19,20).However, blind iron supplementation should be avoided, and iron supplementation provided on a need basis.Approximately 38.2% of pregnant women were anemic globally, among which Africa accounts for the highest magnitude- −44.6% for 44.6% ( 21).
Furthermore, anemia among pregnant women is a serious public health problem in Ethiopia, with an overall prevalence of 62.7%, and this high prevalencehasbeenlinkedtonutritiondeﬁciencies(iron,folate, and vitamin B12) and non-nutritional factors in developing countries (parasitic infections and genetic diseases). Among the aforementioned causes, iron deﬁciency has been assumed to account for roughly half of anemia cases, and mothers with inadequate diets and who did not receive the recommended days of prenatal supplements were more susceptible to anemia (22,23).ANC utilization, educational status, wealth index, anemia complications, knowledge about IFA, family size, history of abortion, and receiving health education are factors that were signiﬁcant predictors of decreased iron supplement adherence in various studies ( 7,12,24,25).
A previous study used only one-point survey data, making it diﬃcult to observe trends and identifypotentialpredictorsthathavecontributedtoinﬂuencing iron supplement adherence over time.

The DHS used a two-stage stratiﬁed sampling technique, selectingindividualsintwostagesbasedonthe1994Population and Housing Census (PHS) frame for EDHS 2005 and the 2007 PHS frame for EDHS 2011 and 2016. Each region was stratiﬁed byseparatingitintourbanandruralareas.Ethiopiaiscomposed of nine national regions and two administrative towns, so the total number of strata created was 21 because Addis Ababa is entirely urban.A total of 540 enumeration areas (EAs) (395 in rural areas) for EDHS 2005, 624 EAs (534 in rural areas) for EDHS 2011, and 645 EAs (445 in rural areas) for EDHS 2016 were selected in the ﬁrst stage, with proportional to EA size and independent selection in each stratum.In the second stage,householdswereselected usingasystematicapproach per enumeration area.ThefullEDHS reportincluded details on the sampling design for the EDHS ( 26).In 2005, 2011, and 2016 EDHS,thesamplewasdrawnfromallpregnantwomenwhohad atleastonelivebirthintheprevious5years.
Study variables Dependent variables In this study, adherence to iron supplementation was taken as the dependent variable. It was deﬁned as an intake of iron tablets or syrup supplements daily for 90 days during a recent pregnancy( 27–29).Theithwomeninthedependentvariableare represented by a random variable Yi, with two possible values coded 1 and 0.As a result, the ith women Y iresponse variable wasmeasuredasadichotomousvariable,withpossiblevaluesof Yi=1ifithwomenhadtakenirontabletsorsyrupsupplements for90days,andY =0ifwomenhadnottaken90days.Independent variables The sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables such as age of the women, residence, parity, employment status, educational status of their husbands, educational status of women, and wealth index were used to explain the adherence level.

The wealth index was categorized into three categories by combiningthepoorestandpoorerintotheﬁrstcategory“poor;” middle wealth level into the second category “middle;” and richer and richest into the third category called “rich,” based on thepreviousliterature( 30,31).Data collection procedure Since the study was based on the EDHS, data were obtained from the oﬃcial database of the DHS program at www.measuredhs.com .After requesting permission online and explaining the purpose of the study, permission was granted.
The raw data were collected from all over the country on pregnantmothersandmotherswhohadatleastonelivebirthin the previous 5 years about their iron–folic acid adherence level duringpregnancy. Data quality assurance Data from the EDHS 2005, 2011, and 2016 were accessed fromtheDHSoﬃcialdatabaseandwereappendedtogetherafter extracting the relevant variables for trend and decomposition analysis.STATAversion14softwarewasusedtoclean,compute, recode, and handle the missed data.Before any statistical analysis,thedatawereweightedusingsamplingweight,primary sampling units, and strata to restore the representativeness of the data and to instruct STATA to take the sampling design into account when calculating the standard sampling errors to make the statistical estimates reliable.To describe the study population,summarystatisticswerecomputed.Trend and multivariable decomposition analysis The adherence level trend was examined for the EDHS 2005–2011, 2011–2016, and 2005–2016 periods separately.
A multivariable decomposition analysis of the change in the adherence level to iron supplement use was used to answer the question of how the adherence level to iron supplement use responds to changes in women’s characteristics and how these factors shape the diﬀerences in adherence to iron supplement use across three consecutive EDHSs conducted at diﬀerent time points. To identify factors associated with the change in the adherenceleveloverthelast10years,alogit-basedmultivariable decomposition analysis was used.The change in the adherence level over time can be attributed to the survey composition and diﬀerences in the eﬀect of the selected predictors.As a result, the observed diﬀerence in the adherence level between surveys canbedecomposedadditivelyintoacharacteristic(endowment) Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org Delie et al.

Results Respondents’ socioeconomic and demographic characteristics According to the ﬁndings of this study, the majority of respondents (79.1% in the EDHS 2005, 72.1% in theEDHS 2011, and 80.8% in the EDHS 2016) lived in rural areas of the country. Almost half of the respondents (in all three EDHSs) were wealthy and between the ages of 25 and 34 years.Furthermore, a large proportion of respondents (in all EDHSs) had no formal education, implying that the proportion of respondent women with secondary or higher education was very low (ranging from 12.4 to 14.9%).In the EHDS 2005, 2011, and 2016, ∼58.5, 62.8, and 69.1% of the respondentshadgivenbirthtoonetofourchildren,respectively.In addition, more than half of the respondents from the EDHS 2011 and 2016 were employed women.However, only 35.1% of the respondents were employed in the EDHS 2005 (Table1).
Respondents’ health service-related characteristics The pregnancy status, number of ANC visits, timing of ﬁrst ANC visit, accessibility of healthcare, exposure to mass media, and who told about pregnancy complications were used to examine respondents’ health service-related characteristics. In the EDHS 2016 and 2005, a majority (75.7%) and more than half (57.6%) of the women, respectively, responded that a child was desired during pregnancy.More than half of the EDHS 2011 and 2016 respondents (54 and 55%, respectively) made four or more antenatal care visits.However, the proportion of EDHS 2005 respondents who made four or more antenatal care visits was about 46% (Table2).Trends in the proportion of adherence levels to iron supplements The proportion of respondents who took iron tablets or syrup for 90 days and above increased from 1.1% (95% CI; 0.4, 2.7) in the EDHS 2005 to 12.4% (95% CI; 10.9, 14.1) in the EDHS 2016.
The trends of adherence were positively increased in both phases: phase 1 (from EDHS 2005 to 2011) and phase 2 (from EDHS 2011 to 2016). However, a larger increase in the proportion of adherence levels was observed in phase 2 (9.7%) than in phase 1 (1.6%).There was an 11.3% total increase in the proportion of adherence levels between the EDHS 2005 and 2016 (Figure1).Proportion of adherence levels based on sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics Thepointpercentdiﬀerencesintheproportionofadherence levels between EDHS 2011–2005, 2016–2011, and 2016–2005 Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/four.tnum frontiersin.org Delie et al.

Due to compositional eﬀects and behavioral eﬀects According to the results of the decomposition analysis, approximately one-third (30.9 %) of the overall change in the adherence level to iron supplement use during pregnancy between EDHSs 2005 and 2016 was due to diﬀerences in characteristics (compositional factors). Women who made four or more ANC visits and were informed about pregnancy complications contributed 11 and 10%, respectively, to the positive change in the adherence level between the EDHSs 2005 and 2016.In addition to compositional eﬀects, the diﬀerence in coeﬃcients accounted for nearly two-thirds (69.1 %) of the change in the adherence level (behavioral characteristics).Women in age categories of 25–34 and 35–49 years, those from aﬄuent households, and those with a husband with a secondaryorhighereducationalstatushadasigniﬁcantpositive contribution to the change in adherence behavior between the EDHSs 2005 and 2016.
About 26.6% of women in the age category of 25–34 years, 8.3% in the age category of 35–49 years, 26.6% from rich households, and 4.5% with husbands with secondary/educational status had contributed to a positivechange in adherence behavior of respondents between EDHSs 2005 and 2016. Women who desired a child had a 3.2% positive contribution for an increase in adherence behavior between EDHSs2011and2016( Tables5,6).Discussion During phase 1 (EDHS 2005–2011), the proportion of adherence increased from 1.09% (95% CI; 0.44, 2.67) to 2.71 % (95%CI;1.79,4.07).Italsoincreasedfrom2.71%(95%CI;1.79, 4.07)intheEDHS2011 to12.42 %(95%CI;10.90, 14.12) inthe EDHS2016.ThiscouldbeduetotheEthiopianNNSkeygoalof increasingtheproportionofpregnantwomenwhoreceiveiron– folatesupplementsformorethan90daysduringpregnancyand thepostpartumperiodto50%by2023( 14).
The decomposition analysis revealed that compositional eﬀects accounted for approximately 30.9% of change in adherence levels (between the EDHSs 2005 and 2016).

It is obvious that an adequate number of ANC visits and discussions about pregnancy complications are critical for increasing women’s awareness of the importance of taking iron tablets or syrup for 90 days during pregnancy. As a result, over time, women who made an adequate number of ANC visits had higher levels of awareness about the minimum recommended days of taking iron tablets or syrup during pregnancy than women who did not make an adequate number of ANC visits.Furthermore, women who received information about pregnancycomplications duringanANCvisitweremoreaware of the causes, consequences, and prevention of iron deﬁciency anemiaduringpregnancythanwomenwhodidnotreceivesuch services.Previous research in Ethiopia corroborates this ﬁnding (29,33).The diﬀerence in coeﬃcients accounted for the remaining 69.1% of the overall change in adherence levels.
Older aged women from wealthy households and women with husbands with secondary or higher education all contributed positively to the overall change in respondents’ adherence behavior. Older aged women may have more knowledge about anemiaduring pregnancy and have made a higher number of ANC visits, allowing them to adhere to iron supplement use during pregnancy.This could explain why women aged 25–34 and 35– 49 years made a signiﬁcant positive contribution to the overall change in adherence to iron supplement use when compared with women aged 15–24 years.The ﬁnding was also supported by previous studies ( 7,34); women in the age-group of 35–49 years were 7% more likely to adhere to iron supplements than youngerwomenaged15–24years.Furthermore, wealthy women signiﬁcantly contributed 26.6% to the increase in adherence behavior than women from poor households over the last 10 years.
This could be because wealthy women have more ﬁnancial resources to purchase iron tablets or syrup during pregnancy. This ﬁnding was similar to that of other studies ( 7,29), which reported that wealthy women were more likely to be adherent than women from poorhouseholds.Husbands with secondary or higher education made a 4.5% signiﬁcant positive contribution to the increase in behavioral eﬀects of adherence.The ﬁnding is supported by previous studies carried out in Ethiopia ( 28,29,35).This could be because husbands with secondary or higher education have better communicate with community leaders, health extension workers, and medical specialists than those without formal Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/eight.tnum frontiersin.org Delie et al.

This communication and reading ability may have increased husbands’ awareness of the beneﬁts of taking iron supplements for recommended days during pregnancy, thereby improving their wives’ adherence. This is because Ethiopian wivesaremostlyledbytheirhusbands.According to our ﬁndings, women who had 10 or more children had a 2.9% negative contribution to the change in behavior of the adherence level compared with women who had one to four children.This could be because, in general, urban communities provide better care and protection Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/nine.tnum frontiersin.org Delie et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/five.tnum/five.tnum/eight.tnum/one.tnum/nine.tnum to pregnant women who have not given birth to a child.Following the birth of the ﬁrst child without complications, subsequent pregnancies are regarded as low risk.
Furthermore, a higher number of children ever born indicates a higher number of children in the household; as a result, women may have more responsibility and less time to visit health facilities for ANC. Despite the lack of a direct study supporting this ﬁnding, a related study ( 7) found that women who had ever given birth to 10 or more children were less likely to be adherent than women who had given birth to one to fourchildren.Between the EDHSs 2011 and 2016, women who desired pregnancy had a 19.9% positive contribution to an increase in the adherence behavior.This implies that the change in the adherence behavior among women who desired a child at the time of pregnancy was much higher than the change in the adherence behavior among women who did not desire a child during pregnancy.This could be because women who desired a child at the time of pregnancy pay more attention to their child’s health by taking the minimum recommended days of iron supplementation duringpregnancy.
Strengths and limitations A nationally representative large data set and a rigorous statistical analysis method were used in this study. The sources of these secondary data were trustworthy.The study investigated the changes in adherence levels and the factors that contributed to them between the EDHSs 2005 and 2016.Despite its strength, this study did not include some important variables such as women’s awareness of maternal anemia, perceptions/beliefsaboutnottakingirontablets,andsideeﬀects ofironsupplementusebypregnantwomen.Thecross-sectional design of the survey precludes the determination of cause-and- eﬀectrelationships.Conclusion According to the EDHS, behavioral eﬀects were responsible for nearly two-thirds (69.1%) of the overall change in the level of adherence, while compositional eﬀects were responsible for one-third (30.9%) of the signiﬁcant increase in the proportion of pregnant women who used iron supplements between 2005 and 2016.
Most importantly, during the past 10 years, there has been a surge in the behavioral impacts of adherence due to women from wealthier families, older women, women with spouses with secondary or higher education, and women with a desire forconception.Increasesinthepercentageofwomenwhohadfourormore antenatalvisitsandincreasesinthenumberofwomenwhowere informedaboutpregnancyproblemswerecompositionaleﬀects that helped improve the trend in the degree of adherence to takingironsupplementsduringpregnancy.
