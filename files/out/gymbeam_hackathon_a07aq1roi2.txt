EXPRE SSION OFCONCERN Expression ofConcern: Vitamin ETPGS based transferosomes augmented TATasa promising delivery system forimproved transdermal delivery ofraloxifene ThePLOS ONE Editors Following thepublication ofthisarticle [1],concerns were raised regarding results presented inFigs 2and 5.Specifically, -The Fig2Bpanel inthisarticle appears tooverlap with Figure 2of[2]and theFigure 1B panel of[3].-The Fig5Raw Rhfilm 4hpanel appears topartially overlap with theFig5Rh-TPGS-Trans- ferosomes-Film 4hpanel.The authors commented that theTEM images inthisarticle arecorrect, and that they were inadvertently duplicated in[2,3].Furthermore, theauthors stated that theincorrect panel was used fortheFig5Raw Rhfilm 4hresults and provided anupdated Fig5with thecorrect image, which isincluded with thisnotice.The rawdata underlying theFigure 2,4,5,and 6 results areprovided intheS1–S4 Files.
The corresponding author stated that during thedata collection fortheFig5results, multi- pleimages were captured ofthesame samples sothat thehighest resolution images could be used forpublication. However, duetoacoding error ofthedata files, some images uninten- tionally overlapped.Editorial assessment oftheFig5underlying data provided bytheauthors highlighted addi- tional panel overlap concerns, asoneoftherawunderlying images provided fortheRh-TPGS Transferosomes 4hresults appears topartially overlap with oneoftherawunderlying images provided fortheRh-TPGS Transferosomes TAT 1hresults.The authors stated that theaddi- tional image overlap intheunderlying data isalso theresult oftheunintentional coding error.Inlight ofthese coding errors, thereliability oftheFig5results isinquestion, and these data should beinterpreted with caution.The quantitative data underlying other results reporting inthearticle areavailable upon request from thecorresponding author.
Inlight oftheconcerns raised both with thearticle and theunderlying data provided, the PLOSONE Editors issue thisExpression ofConcern tonotify readers oftheabove concerns and torelay theavailable data provided bythecorresponding author.
