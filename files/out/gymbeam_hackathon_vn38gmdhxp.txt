Design and Setting: After an overnight fast, urinary Cr and creatinine concentrations, muscleCrconcentration,bodymass,TBW, ECW, and ICW were measured, and subjects were ran- domly assigned to either a Cr or a placebo (P) group. The Crgroup ingested 25 g/d of Cr for 7 days (loading phase) and 5g/d for the remaining 21 days (maintenance phase), whereasthe P group ingested a sucrose P using the same protocol.Allthe measures were reassessed immediately after the loadingand maintenance phases.Subjects: Sixteen men (age 522.8 63.01 years, height 5 179.8 67.1 cm, body mass 584.8 611.2 kg) and 16 women(age 521.8 62.51years,height 5163.4 65.9cm,bodymass 563.6 614.0 kg) involved in resistance training volunteered to participate in this study.Measurements: Muscle Cr concentration was determined from the vastus lateralis muscle using a percutaneous needle-biopsy technique.Total body water, ECW, and ICW volumeswere assessed using deuterium oxide and sodium bromide di-lution analyses.
Results: The Cr group experienced a signi®cant increase in muscle Cr concentration, body mass, and TBW. The P groupexperienced a small but signi®cant increase in TBW only.Conclusions: TheCrsupplementationprotocolwaseffective for increasing muscle Cr concentrations, body mass, and TBW;however, ¯uid distribution was not changed.Key Words: ergogenic aids, hydration, ¯uid balance, body mass, body composition Creatine (Cr) supplementation continues to be extremely popular as a potential ergogenic aid among athletes atall levels.Studies have shown that muscleCrand phos- phocreatine can be signi®cantly elevated when a normal dietis supplemented with Cr.1±4The theory behind its use is sim- ilar to that of carbohydrate loading, because an increasedmus-cle Cr content would conceivably enhance the capacity of thephosphagen energy system, providing greater resistance to fa-tigue and improving performance.
Anecdotal reports of ergo-genic value have been supported by scienti®cally controlledstudies investigating its effects on strength, 5±8power,8±11 speed,12and fatigue.4,13,14However, not all the ®ndings sup- port ergogenic claims.3,15,16 Numerous anecdotal reports have associated muscle cramp- ing, spasm, strains, gastrointestinal distress, kidney dysfunc- tion, and heat illness with Cr supplementation. At this time,however, the only side effect directly associated with Cr sup- plementation is weight gain.5±8,11,13,16±19Some of these au- thors have reported increases in body mass after only aloadingphase of supplementation (20±25 g/d for 5±7 days).8,11,13,16 Thus, it is likely that the gains are due more to greater waterretention during supplementation than to lean-tissue accretion.It is conceivable that increased muscle Cr concentrations areassociated with changes in the intracellular osmotic pressure,resulting in movement of water into the cell, water retention,and weight gain.
When water loss through sweating occursfrom exercise, increased environmental temperatures, or acombination of both, this intracellular ¯uid shift may be det-rimental. For example, the water bound inside the cell maynot be available to the extracellular compartment for thermalregulation.Therefore, cramping and other heat-related prob-lems may result from a ¯uid shift occurring during supple- Journal of Athletic Training 45mentation.However, the existence of this Cr-related ¯uid shift is speculative because only 1 group19to date has reported changes in ¯uid distribution after supplementation.It must benoted that ¯uid volumes were not measured directly in thatstudy but were predicted using a bioelectric impedance anal-ysis.Furthermore, muscle Cr was not assessed, so whether thechanges in ¯uid distribution were actually associated with anincreased muscle Cr concentration is unknown.
Therefore, thepurpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Cr sup-plementation on muscle Cr concentration and ¯uid distributionusing a direct measure of ¯uid volumes. METHODSSubjects Sixteen men (age 522.863.01 years, height 5179.8 6 7.1 cm, body mass 584.8611.2 kg) and 16 women (age 5 21.8 62.51 years, height 5163.4 65.9 cm, body mass 5 63.6614.0 kg) who were involved in a total-body resistance training program for at least 3 days per week were randomlyassigned to either a Cr supplementation group or a placebo(P) group.We excluded subjects from participation if they hadsupplemented their habitual diet with any form of Cr duringthe past 60 days; were suffering from any form of kidney,liver, or endocrine disease or any disorder that might affectnormal cellular levels of Cr or ¯uid balance (or both); or weretaking any substance classi®ed as a diuretic other than thecaffeine found in their habitual diet.
We also excluded womenwho were currently using oral contraceptives and women whohad not completed 2 menstrual cycles since last using oralcontraceptives. Before participating, each subject read a de-scription of the study and signed an informed consent formapproved by the university's institutional review board, whichalso approved the study.Procedures The evening before the supplementation period began, each subject reported to the university's General Clinical ResearchCenter for an overnight stay and for baseline measurements.We instructed the subjects to refrain from any type of exerciseafter the last meal of the day before being admitted for theovernight stay.To control for changes in ¯uid distributionacross the menstrual cycle, each woman began the study be-tween days 1 and 7 of the cycle.Upon arrival at the Center,venous blood and urine samples were taken for a completeclinical chemistry panel (20 items) and for drugs of abuse,anabolic steroid, and pregnancy screen.
After an overnightfast, we measured each subject for body mass, urinary Cr andcreatinine concentrations, total body water (TBW) content, ex-tracellular water (ECW) content, and muscle Cr concentration.Once these measurements were completed, the supplementa-tion period began. We instructed the subjects to maintain theirnormal diets and their regular resistance-training programsthroughout the entire supplementation and testing period.Wealso instructed the subjects to refrain from ingesting any typeof nonsteroidal anti-in¯ammatory medication, nutritional sup-plement, or substance classi®ed as a diuretic other than thecaffeine found in the habitual diet.Each subject was requiredto maintain a training log in which the number of sets, repe-titions, and the resistance used were recorded during each ex-ercise session.Additionally, we asked each subjecttocompletea weekly questionnaire designed to determine the incidence of any adverse effects during supplementation.
All subjects re-ported back to the Center on the evening of the seventh and28th (®nal) day of supplementation, at which time the over-night fast and subsequent measurements were repeated. Supplementation We randomly assigned each subject to either a Cr supple- mentation group or a P group in a double-blind fashion.Sub-jects in the Cr group (8 men, 8 women) ingested 5.0 g ofPhosphagen (Experimental and Applied Sciences, Inc,Golden,CO) mixed with 15 g of a ¯avored simple carbohydrate 5times per day for 7 days (loading phase).Immediately afterthe loading phase, each subject ingested the same supplementonce a day for the remaining 21 days (maintenance phase).Subjects in the P group (8 men, 8 women) ingested 20 g ofthe ¯avored simple carbohydrate for 28 days using the sameprotocol as the Cr group.Individual-dose packages, identicalin weight, were prepared for the Cr and the P groups anddispensed weekly.
We instructed the subjects to mix the pow-der supplement with 16 oz (0.47 L) of water and maintain adaily record of the supplementation times. Finally, to furthermonitor compliance, we asked each subject to return any un-used portions at the end of each week.Measurements Urinary Creatine and Creatinine.Urine samples were collected and frozen at 2808C for later analysis of Cr and creatinine concentrations using high-performance liquid chro-matography.Muscle Creatine Concentration.Afterlocalanesthesiaand incision of the skin, muscle samples were obtained from thevastus lateralis muscle of the nondominant leg using a per-cutaneous needle-biopsy technique modi®ed to include suc-tion.20Immediately after removal, the tissue samples werefro- zen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 2808C for later analysis.
When all testing sessions were completed, the tissue sampleswere packaged in dry ice and shipped overnight to a humanperformance laboratory, where they were later freeze dried,dissected free of any blood and connective tissue, and pow-dered. The powdered muscle was then extracted with perchlo-ric acid, neutralized, and analyzed enzymatically for muscleCr using a spectrophotometric analysis described by Harris etal.20 Body Mass and Total Body Water Volume.Body mass was assessed using a digital scale from the BOD POD BodyComposition Tracking System (Life Measurements, Inc, Con-cord, CA).Total body water was determined using adeuteriumoxide dilution method, which has been shown to be a validand reliable measurement technique.21±24We administered each subject an oral dose of deuterium oxide of approximately0.15 g/kg of body mass, which was weighed out and dilutedwith sterile water for intake.
Before ingestion and after a 4-hour equilibration period, two 5-mL venous blood sampleswere drawn for comparison. After extraction from the blood,the plasma was frozen at 2208C and stored for later analysis.Samples were then packaged with dry ice and shipped over-night to Metabolic Solutions, Inc (Nashua, NH), where deu-terium enrichment in the body ¯uid was measured using iso-tope ratio mass spectrometry.

Thesame blood samples taken for the deuterium analysiswerealsoused for the sodium bromide analysis, with the bromide con-centration in the serum ultra®ltrate determined by high-per-formance liquid chromatography (Metabolic Solutions, Inc).Because of the extreme sensitivity of this method, small quan-tities of bromide can be administered for the analysis,allowingfor suf®cient washout between measurement days. 26The cor- rected bromide space was calculated and used to determinetheECW volume.25±27The intracellular water (ICW) volume was calculated by subtracting the ECW volume from the TBWvolume.Statistical Analysis We used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciencessoft- ware (version 10.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) to perform thestatistical analysis of the raw data.
All dependent measureswere analyzed using a 1-within (time), 2-between (group andsex) mixed design with repeated-measures analyses of vari-ance and Tukey Honestly Signi®cant Difference post hoc teststo test differences between means. For all statistical tests, thealpha level was set at .05.RESULTSBlood and Urine Analyses Analyses for anabolic steroids and drugs of abuse were neg- ative for all subjects at each testing date, and no differenceswere observed in either group for blood or urine creatinine concentrations.However, the time-by-group (F 2,56525.56, P5.000) and time-by-sex (F 2,5654.04,P5.023) interac- tions for urinary Cr concentration were signi®cant.The Crgroup had signi®cantly greater urinary Cr concentrations ondays 7 and 28 as compared with presupplementation, whereasno changes were observed in the P group (Table).Further-more, women experienced greater urinary Cr concentrationsthan did men on days 7 and 28.
Muscle Creatine Concentration Assays for Cr could not be completed for 4 subjects (2 each in the Cr and P groups); thus, these subjects were not includedin the Cr analysis. The time-by-group interaction was signi®-cant (F 2,4854.75,P5.013): the Cr group had a greater Cr concentration on days 7 and 28 as compared with presupple-mentation (see Table).No changes were observed in the Pgroup.No differences were observed when the men and wom-en within the Cr group were compared before or after supple-mentation.Body Mass A signi®cant time-by-group interaction (F 2,5653.30,P5 .044) was observed for body mass, as the Cr group experi-enced a signi®cant increase from presupplementation to day28 (see Table).The Cr group's body mass on day 7 was 0.75kg greater than at presupplementation; however, this changewas not signi®cant.The Tukey post hoc test revealed that anincrease of 0.88 kg was necessary for statistical signi®cance.The P group did not experience any signi®cant changes inbody mass.
As expected, men had greater body mass thanwomen, but there were no signi®cant sex interactions. Total Body Water Volume A signi®cant time-by-group interaction (F 2,5653.86,P5 .027) was observed for TBW (see Table).Both groups expe-rienced signi®cantly greater TBW levels on days 7 and 28 ascompared with presupplementation, but the increasewasgreat-er in the Cr group.The Tukey post hoc test revealed that a Journal of Athletic Training 47difference of 0.86 L was necessary for statistical signi®cance.The differences of 0.87 and 0.89 L experienced by the P groupwere just higher than this value.Although no difference ex-isted between the groups before supplementation, the Cr grouphad a signi®cantly greater TBW volume on days 7 and 28than did the P group.As expected, men had a greater TBWthan women; however, there were no signi®cant sex interac-tions.Extracellular Water and Intracellular Water Volumes As expected, men had greater ICW and ECW volumes, but there were no sex interactions.
No other signi®cant main ef-fects or interactions, including a time-by-group interaction(F 2,5651.02,P5.366) for ICW, were observed. Further- more, when ICW was expressed relative to the TBW, no sig-ni®cant changes were noted.DISCUSSION We examined the changes in muscle Cr, body mass, and body water during periods of Cr loading and maintenance inmen and women.The supplementation protocol was indeedeffective for increasing muscle Cr concentrations.The increas-es in muscle Cr were associated with increases in both TBWand body mass.However, only TBW increased during theloading phase, whereas the increase in body mass was notobserved until both the loading and maintenance phases werecompleted.Muscle Creatine Several reports indicate that muscle Cr concentration can be elevated when a normal diet is supplemented with oral Cr.1±4 Our Cr group experienced a 20% increase in Cr concentrationduring the ®rst week (loading phase) of supplementation.
Thisincrease was then maintained throughout the remaining 3weeks (maintenance phase). As expected, a large amount of between-subject variability was observed for the change in muscle Cr concentration frompresupplementation to the end of the loading phase.Similar®ndings have been reported previously, 1±3which may explain why some individuals do not experience an ergogenic ef-fect.15,16Greenhaff28reported that 20% to 30% of individuals do not respond to Cr supplementation ( ,10 mmol/kgdrymass [dm] [8%] in muscle Cr concentration).Similarly, we ob-served that 4 subjects (28%) in our study failed to respond tothe supplementation.The dosages we used were not adjustedfor body mass; thus, each subject ingested equal amounts ofCr.Because of this, it might be expected that a greater effectwould be seen in individuals with smaller body mass.How-ever, this was not observed because the nonresponders repre-sented a wide range of body mass (57.09±86.21 kg).
Further-more, the increase experienced by women (body mass 563.63 612.58 kg) was not different from that experienced by men (body mass 587.46 611.98 kg). This is not unexpected because the 7-day loading protocol should have been suf®cientfor maximizing muscle uptake regardless of body mass.1For example, women ingesting Cr experienced a greater increasein urinary Cr excretion than did men after both the loadingand maintenance phases.Although sex differences have notbeen reported previously, they are not unexpected.Any Cr nottaken in by the muscle or other tissues remains in the plasmaand is eventually ®ltered through the kidneys and excreted in the urine.Because of their lower body mass, women had lessavailable tissue for Cr uptake, resulting in a greater amount ofexcess Cr.Thus, factors other than the relative dose-responserelationship play a role in the total Cr uptake by the muscle.
Greenhaff 28observed that 20% of individuals achieved Cr concentrations of approximately 150 to 160 mmol/kg dm aftersupplementation. This concentration is considered to be theupper limit of muscle Cr stores, although some individuals,including 4 subjects in the present study, achieve higherlevels.Whereas a number of factors have been suggested to affectmuscle Cr uptake, the primary determinant appears to be theinitial muscle Cr concentration.1,3,28The normal muscle Cr concentration of the human vastus lateralis appears to be ap-proximately 124 mmol/kg dm.2,20In our subjects, the average muscle Cr concentration before supplementation was 125.6mmol/kg dm, with a large amount of between-subject vari-ability (105.9±150.8 mmol/kg dm).
Our ®ndings are consistentwith those of previous authors, 1±3who reported a wide vari- ation (100±150 mmol/kg dm) in the initial muscle Cr content.Increases in muscle Cr concentration aftersupplementationap-pear to be inversely related to the initial Cr concentration. 1,28 In support of the above, we observed a signi®cant correla- tion between the initial Cr levels and the increases in muscleCr after supplementation ( r520.75,P,.01).Subjects in the Cr group with an initial Cr concentration less than 120mmol/kg dm experienced an average increase of 33.4mmol/kg dm (23.1%), whereas subjects with an initial Cr con-centration greater than 120 mmol/kg dm only experienced anaverage increase of 16.6 mmol/kg dm (11.2%) during theload-ing phase.Body Mass Previous investigators 8,11,13,16have reported increases in body mass after a loading phase of Cr supplementation.
Al-though the Cr group did experience an increase in the presentstudy, the increase did not reach signi®cance until the entiresupplementation protocol had been completed (1.31-kg in-crease after 28 days). In contrast, the P group failed to expe-rience any signi®cant changes in body mass.This is consistentwith other studies reporting increases after a protocol of Crloading and maintenance.6,7,17±19However, body mass mea- surements were not taken immediately after the loading phasein those studies.Thus, whether their subjects experienced anyimmediate changes in body mass is unknown.In our study,the increase observed in the Cr group after the loading phase(0.75 kg) was slightly lower than what the Tukey post hoc testdemonstrated as necessary for signi®cance (0.88 kg).This wasunexpected because increases of 0.70 and 0.75 kg afterloadinghad previously been found to be statistically signi®cant.
11,16 However, our ®ndings are not isolated because others12,14,29,30 have also failed to observe signi®cant body mass changesaftera loading phase of supplementation. Although 4 subjects (including 3 women) in the Cr group failed to experience an increase in body mass after 28 days ofsupplementation, the range for those who did was consistentwith gains previously observed, from 0.47 to 3.92 kg.6,7,17±19 At this time, the exact cause of the weight gain has not beendetermined.However, increases in protein synthesis and waterretention are the 2 more commonly cited theories.Protein Synthesis.It has been theorized that at least part of the increase in body mass can be attributed to increased 48Volume 38 •Number 1 •March 2003protein synthesis and morphologic changes within the skeletal muscle.13Recently reported data suggest that Cr supplemen- tation might amplify protein synthesis stimulation in responseto resistance training.
31In that study, however, protein content was only examined after 12 weeks of supplementation andtraining. Thus, the effect of Cr after only 1 week or even after4 weeks of training is unknown.As mentioned previously,because a number of authors 8,11,13,16reported increases in body mass in as few as 5 to 7 days, it is unlikely that thesechanges can be explained by protein synthesis alone.Water Retention.The gains in body mass observed are likely due to water retention during supplementation.Creatineis an osmotically active substance.Thus, any increase in thebody's Cr content should result in increased water retentionand consequent gains in body mass.
2,8For example, 1 subject in the present study, who reported having a fairly consistentbody mass throughout the previous year, experienced a 4.8-kgincrease in body mass during the ®rst week of supplementa-tion, 90% of which was accounted for by the increase in TBW.The limited number of investigators 12,17±19,32who have re- ported TBW volumes during supplementation provide con-trasting results. Signi®cant increases in TBW have been ob-served after 6 19and 917weeks of supplementation, whereas a similar 4-week protocol failed to affect TBW.32However, whether the subjects in these studies actually experienced anincrease in muscle Cr is unknown because Cr concentrationswere not measured.Furthermore, in each of these studies, abioelectric impedance analysis was used to estimate TBW.Such analysis is a prediction of TBW and is associated witherrors ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 L.
33Dilution techniques, such as the deuterium oxide and sodium bromide we used, are con-sidered criterion measures of body water. 34,35To our knowl- edge, we are the ®rst to directly measure muscle Cr and ¯uid balance during supplementation, and our results suggest thatincreases in muscle Cr concentrations are associated with wa-ter retention.Both groups had similar TBW volumes at thebeginning of the study.However, although both groups ex-perienced an increase in TBW during the ®rst week of sup-plementation, the Cr group's TBW was signi®cantly greaterthan the P group's TBW after both the loading and mainte-nance phases (see Table).These ®ndings support previous re-search because the increase experienced by the Cr group(4.86%) is similar to that observed using the bioelectric im-pedance analysis measure (5.30% and 4.47%).17,19 We initially theorized that water retention would be respon- sible for the immediate gains in body mass after supplemen-tation.
As expected, the changes in TBW experienced by theCr group were similar to those observed for body mass. Thegreatest increase in TBW (1.37 L) occurred during the ®rstweek of supplementation, whereas the greatestdifferencecom-pared with presupplementation occurred after 28 days of sup-plementation (2.04 L).It is interesting to note, however, thatthe increase in TBW we observed would actually account fora greater increase in body mass.We would expect that a TBWincrease of 1.37 L would be associated with a body mass in-crease of approximately 1.37 kg.Yet, the Cr group only ex-perienced a nonsigni®cant 0.75-kg increase during this time.An explanation for this ®nding is not readily apparentbutmustinvolve decreased caloric intake or increased caloric expen-diture (or both) during supplementation.A BOD POD BodyComposition Tracking System digital scale was used for allbody mass measurements, and a dilution technique was usedto determine TBW.
We also performed a bioelectricimpedanceanalysis assessment of TBW as a secondary measure. When we analyzed these data, we observed a signi®cantandidentical1.37-L increase in TBW after the loading phase.Thus, we donot question the validity of our data.Fluid Intake.During the loading phase, the subjects in both groups ingested their respective supplements with approxi-mately 454 mL of water 5 times per day.It is possible thatthe increase in TBW content is the result of an increased ¯uidintake during the week ( ;15.89 L).This is the most likely explanation for the slight increase experienced by the P group.However, the greater increase experienced by the Cr groupsuggests that the subjects experienced greater water retention.Thus, Cr uptake may have in¯uenced water retention.Because¯uid intake and urinary volume were not assessed, we couldnot determine whether increased ¯uid intake or decreased¯uidloss or both were responsible for the change in body water.Caloric Intake and Expenditure.
We instructed our sub- jects to maintain their normal, habitual diet throughout thesupplementation period. Although we did not record dietaryintake, other authors 8,10,18have reported consistent caloric in- takes while increases in body mass occurred during supple-mentation.Anecdotally, our subjects reported a decreased ap-petite at times during the supplementation period because theydescribed a ``full'' feeling from ingesting the supplement and¯uid on 5 occasions each day.Decreases in caloric intake dur-ing supplementation have been previously reported.6,7Unfor- tunately, TBW volumes were not assessed in those studies;thus, it is unknown if they increased or not.It is also possiblethat the subjects in the Cr group experienced an ergogeniceffect, allowing for greater training volume during this period.This may have resulted in greater caloric expenditure.
Thus,it is possible that increased ¯uid intake, decreased caloric in-take, and increased caloric expenditure are responsible for our®ndings. Intracellular Water Retention.Because Cr is primarily stored intramuscularly (95%), it is more likely thattheincreasein TBW would be intracellular because of the direct in¯ux ofwater into the muscle cell.Previous investigators 12,18,32were unable to determine whether increases in lean body mass weredue to cellular water retention or gains in actual muscle pro-tein, because only TBW was assessed during supplementation.More recently, however, ¯uid distribution has been assessedbut only using the bioelectric impedance analysis predic-tion.17,19We directly measured ¯uid distribution usingdilution techniques and observed a 1.13-L (4.62%) increase in ICW inthe Cr group.However, this change was not statistically sig-ni®cant.Increases in ICW have been reported previouslyusingthe bioelectric impedance analysis prediction.
17,19In those studies, increases of 3.30 L (9.0%) and 1.00 L (4.93%) werestatistically signi®cant. The nonsigni®cant increase we observed accounted for 55.4% of the increase in TBW volume, which is fairly con-sistent with normal ¯uid distribution (approximatelytwothirdsof the TBW is intracellular).This suggests an equal distribu-tion of ¯uid during supplementation.Interestingly, an increasein cell volume appears to be an anabolic proliferative signal,which may be the ®rst step in muscle protein synthesis.36,37 Because of this, increased cell volume has been suggested asa mechanism for protein synthesis stimulation and increasedmuscle mass under conditions of muscular overload during Crsupplementation.7,8 Journal of Athletic Training 49Adverse Effects None of the blood or urinary measures suggested any ad- verse effects as a result of supplementation.
Furthermore,noneof the subjects in the present investigation experienced musclecramping or any other side effects (other than increased bodymass) during the supplementation protocol. However, whetherany subjects performed exercise bouts resulting in a largeamount of water loss is unknown.Thus, a potential relation-ship between Cr supplementation and heat illness cannot beestablished from the results of the present investigation.Limitations of the Study As mentioned previously, caloric and ¯uid intakes were not recorded, and differences in either of these factors could havein¯uenced the changes in body mass and ¯uid balance.Fur-thermore, each subject was involved in an individualized re-sistance training program.These training protocols were notcontrolled for; however, the volume of each training sessionwas recorded.Because of a large amount of variability acrosssubjects, a relationship between training volume and changesin body mass and ¯uid balance could not be established.
Fur-thermore, training protocols before supplementation were notrecorded, so comparisons could not be made. Thus, it is pos-sible that the differences in training volume may also havein¯uenced the changes in body mass and ¯uid balance.6,38,39 CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that the supplementation protocol was effective in increasing muscle Cr concentrations.Increasedmuscle Cr content was associated with an increasedbodymassand TBW volume.Thus, supplementation does result in waterretention.It was initially hypothesized that the water would bepreferentially retained intracellularly, altering ¯uid distribu-tion.However, this was not observed.Therefore, the theoryof a Cr-related ¯uid shift is not supported because ¯uid dis-tribution remained normal.An alteration in ¯uid distributionduring supplementation had been suggested as a cause of mus-cle cramping and other heat-related problems anecdotally as-sociated with Cr supplementation.
Because the subjects failedto experience any side effects beyond weight gain, it cannotbe determined whether athletes supplementing their habitualdiet with oral Cr monohydrate will be more predisposed tomuscle cramping and heat illness than athletes who are notingesting Cr. However, our results do not support the ¯uid-shift theory behind Cr supplementation and heat illness.Thus,from this investigation, a potential relationship between Crsupplementation and heat illness cannot be established.It willbe of value for future researchers to focus on changes in ¯uidbalance and the occurrence of heat illness when Cr supple-mentation is combined with ¯uid loss during exercise.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported in part by a grant from the National Athletic Trainers' Association Research and Education Foundationand in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health to theUniversity of Virginia, General Clinical Research Center, MO1RR00847.
