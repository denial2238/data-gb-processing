Symptoms c an be masked and unclear in a child with ASD due to limited verbal communication.Case Presentation: We report an African-American male with ASD, initially presented at 9 years of agewith complaints of back pain after a fall and dif ﬁculty in walking.Diet history was signi ﬁcant for severely re- stricted to instant noodles and french fries.Evaluated bypeds neurology, the exam showed Grover ’s sign, mildly decreased DTRs, and downgoing plantar response. Theupper extremity couldn ’t be assessed because the patient was not cooperative.CBC, CRP, LFT, ESR, and CPK weresent for possible myopathy and in ﬂammatory conditions.Lab values reported within normal limits other thanCPK 462 U/L(reference range 20-200 U/L) and ALK P1511 U/L(Reference range: 40-130 U/L).Peds neurologysuspected progressive muscle disorder.X-rays, electro-myography, and MRIs of the spine and hip were withinnormal limits.Referred to Genetics, basic genetic panelswere within normal limits.
The patient followed for twoyears without improvement with the concerns of limb- girdle muscular dystrophy. The patient later presented with persistent shoulder and neck pain to ED.Labsshowed CK(elevated 510), LFT (ALK P 1700), BMP (Ca5.3mg/dl reference range: 8.4 –10.5mg/dl), Ionized Ca: 2.92 mg/dl (Ref range: 4.8-5.5 mg/dl).The endocrinologistwas consulted, and further investigations included PTH562.5 pg/ml (Ref range: 15-65 pg/ml), Phosphorus: 4.3mg/dl (3-5 mg/dl), 25 OH Vit.D levels <4 ng/ml(reference range 30-80ng/ml) .X-rays were signi ﬁcant for demineral- ization.The muscular dystrophy panel resulted negative.The patient was admitted to the inpatient unit andstarted on calcitriol, CaCO3, an d ergocalciferol.After ini- tial stabilization, the pat ient was discharged home.During the discharge, the patient was still demonstratingproblems with walking.
The patient was sent home on cal-citriol 0.25mcg, CaCO3 tablets, and Ergocalciferol 50 000units weekly , weekly physical therapy and follow-up byped. endocrinlogist.As Vit.D levels improved, CPK de-creased .With close follow-up, supplements, and physicaltherapy, myopathy entirely resolved in following 2 years.Conclusion: Vit.D de ﬁciency is an uncommon cause of myopathy and should be in a differential diagnosis formyopathy as the condition is reversible and can betreated.Due to restrictive eating patterns and limited so-cial interactions, patients with ASD are at increased riskfor developing nutritional de ﬁciencies.Physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with re-strictive eating.
