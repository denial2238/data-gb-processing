Characterization of chitosan- and b-cyclodextrin- modi ﬁed forms of magnesium-doped hydroxyapatites as enhanced carriers forlevoﬂoxacin: loading, release, and anti- inﬂammatory properties May N.Bin Jumah,aSarah I.Al Othman,aAwatif Abdulaziz Alomari,aAhmed A.Allambc and Mostafa R.Abukhadra *de An advanced form of magnesium-rich hydroxyapatite (Mg $HAP) was modi ﬁed with two types of biopolymers, namely chitosan (CH/Mg $HAP) and b-cyclodextrin (CD/Mg $HAP), producing two types of bio-composites.The synthesized materials were developed as enhanced carriers for levo ﬂoxacin to control its loading, release, and anti-in ﬂammatory properties.The polymeric modi ﬁcation signi ﬁcantly improved the loading e ﬃciency to 281.4 mg g−1for CH/Mg $HAP and 332.4 mg g−1for CD/Mg $HAP compared with 218.3 mg g−1for Mg $HAP.The loading behaviors were determined using conventional kinetic and isotherm models and mathematical parameters of new equilibrium models (the monolayermodel of one energy).
The estimated density of e ﬀective loading sites ( N m (LVX) =88.03 mg g−1 (Mg$HAP), 115.8 mg g−1(CH/Mg $HAP), and 138.5 mg g−1(CD/Mg $HAP)) illustrates the markedly higher loading performance of the modi ﬁed forms of Mg $HAP. Moreover, the loading energies (<40 kJ mol−1) in conjunction with the capacity of each loading site ( n> 1) and Gaussian energies (<8 kJ mol−1) signify the physical trapping of LVX molecules in vertical orientation.The addressed materials validateprolonged and continuous release behaviors.These behaviors accelerated after the modi ﬁcation procedures, as the complete release was identi ﬁed after 160 h (CH/Mg $HAP) and 200 h (CD/Mg $HAP).The releasing behaviors are regulated by both di ﬀusion and erosion mechanisms, according to the kinetic investigations and di ﬀusion exponent analysis (>0.45).
The entrapping of LVX into Mg $HAP induces its anti-in ﬂammatory properties against the generation of cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in human bronchial epithelia cells (NL20), and this e ﬀect displays further enhancement after the integration of chitosan and b-cyclodextrin. 1.Introduction Inammation represents an organism's primary physiological response to multiple diseases, infections, and injuries totissues.1,2Such complicated physiological responses could cause greater damage than normal detrimental stimuli, makingmedications vital in these situations.3,4Patients with cystic brosis can face many serious lung disorders due to theinammatory consequences of chronic bacteria-related infec- tions.5,6This frequently leads to the deterioration of pulmonary tissue, reactivation of neutrophils, and chemotaxis.
Variousantibiotics and anti-in ammatory medications such as azi- thromycin, ibuprofen, and levo oxacin have been administered to successfully minimize chronic infection-associated in am- mation. 6,7Unfortunately, numerous types of commonly used medications have negative side e ﬀects, including disrupted renal function, liver damage, and platelet suppression, inaddition to the documented negative impacts on bloodpressure.8 As an anti-dysentery and antibacterial medication, levo- oxacin (LVX) serves as an e ﬀective form of uoroquinolone therapy that is widely administered for treating immunode - ciency and pneumonia.9–11In addition to its antimicrobial activities, levo oxacin displays remarkable anti-in ammatory characteristics based on its immune-modulating propertiesthat in uence the release of cytokines.

,2 0 2 4 , 14, 16991 –17007 | 16991RSC Advances PAPER interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 levels in human epithelial cells decreases with time.5,7Nevertheless, it has been recognized that levooxacin overdosage can lead to detectable toxicity in the neurological system, digestive system, cardiac system, hema-tological system, and skin. 12Additional detrimental impacts associated with excessive dosages of this medication involvea decrease in the binding of plasma proteins and an increase involume distribution (Vd) and medication clearance.12Moreover, these antibiotics are weakly metabolized in the human body, are frequently excreted, and thus enter the natural environment and water bodies as potentially hazardous contaminants.13,14 Furthermore, the intrusion of remaining medicationthroughout the environment enhances the evolution ofantibiotic-resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria.
7,15Conse- quently, several methods were used to regulate the adminis-tered drug doses, attain improved therapeutic e ﬃcacy, and minimize the undesirable consequences of these types of medications. 16,17This improvement was suggested to be per- formed by either providing innovative versions of therapies orimproving the e ﬃcacy and biological safety of the currently existing traditional types.18 There are several e ﬀective methods that have been applied to avoid the reported drawbacks, including managed medicationdelivery, gradual delivery, speci c administration, and vigorous pursuit.2,5The recently recommended innovative methods of drug administration have a key function in regulating the medication's release level, maintaining the dosage within therequired range, promoting site speci city, and maximizing patient compliance.
17,19Various structures such as clay minerals (montmorillonite and halloysite), zeolites, polymers (chitosanand cellulose), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), hydroxyapa-tites, and other biomaterials were examined and assessed forthis objective. 20–22The drug's permeability as well as retention quality was signi cantly improved by previously developed formulations.23,24Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is a known biomedical material classi ed as apatite with a chemical formula of Ca 10(- PO4)6(OH) 2.Moreover, it is extensively utilized in multiple medical industries, particularly in the disciplines of boneengineering and drug delivery.Its signi cant adsorption prospective, ion-exchanging qualities, extended shelf life, broadsurface area, exible framework, and capacity to respond to acidic and basic environments have all been pointed out as reasons for its wide applications.
25–27It has bioactive, biode- gradable, biocompatible, and osteoconductive functions asa biomedical compound without causing in ammation or toxicity. However, its composition's hydrophilic quality reducesits potency as a vehicle for traditional drugs possessing anorganic chemical structure.25,28Moreover, HAP nanostructures lack stability in acidic environments such as the stomach, rendering them inappropriate for oral delivery.Consequently, several investigations were performed to improve the shape, chemical structure, and crystallographicsizes of HAP in order to improve its chemical, biological, andphysical characteristics.Moreover, this is accomplished via modi cation of its outer surface employing polymer molecules as well as other reacting chemicals.25Composite materials consisting of hydroxyapatite (HAP) and synthesized or naturallyoccurring reactive polymers may help overcome the obstacles hampering the application of HAP in drug administration.
The drawbacks include insu ﬃcient encapsulation capacity, unreg- ulated release rate, raised fragility, strong tendencies foraggregation, and poor plasticity. 29,30Furthermore, HAP nano- structures functionalized using carboxyl groups possess betterinhibition activities against tumor cell growth than the originalparticles.Additionally, the composite material may e ﬃciently regulate the release of medications by the carboxyl groups of polymers, improving the binding e ﬃciency of the dissolved medication and the outer surface of HAP particles.31 Chitosan, a well-known biopolymer material, is essentially used in pharmacological, environmental, and medicinalindustries; it is additionally e ﬀective as a carrier for medications.32–34It is a polyaminosaccharide compound derived from the chitin constituent that comes from numerousbiogenic resources.
32Chitosan possesses notable hemostatic prociency, bioactivity, antibacterial potential, safety, biocom- patibility, and biodegradable properties, along with favorablemechanical and adsorption characteristics. 34b-Cyclodextrin ( b- CD) is a prominent biopolymer that has already been deeplystudied and employed in various hybrid materials includinginorganic constituents for a range of industrial activities.35,36 This is mainly due to its remarkable accessibility, exceptionalbiocompatibility, notable chemical stability, safe nature, and considerable adsorption properties.37,38b-CD is composed of a cyclic glucopyranose framework with six to seven glucose unitsconnected by various (1 /4) glycosidic linkages.The outer- most portion of the structural units is polar, whereas theirinteriors are hydrophobic.34This signi cantly promotes its integration into hybrids with inorganic constituents andenhances the capacities of synthesized carriers to hold medi-cation molecules.
37,39b-CD signi cantly enhances many physi- cochemical properties of the medication when employed as an administration system, particularly physical stability, thera-peutic e ﬃciency, solubility, and chemical reactivity. 40 Thus, the objective of the present investigation is to analyze the implications of the super cial modi cations of magnesium- enriched hydroxyapatite (Mg $HP) using chitosan (CH/Mg $HP) andb-cyclodextrin (CD/Mg $HP) on the characteristics of the resulting bio-composites as e ﬀective carriers for levo oxacin.The composites' prospective as carriers was evaluated viaan in- depth assessment of their loading characteristics and regu-lating mechanisms, as well as their release aspects and corre-sponding releasing kinetics.Furthermore, the cytotoxicitycharacteristics of the assessed structures and their anti-inammatory qualities following their loading with LVX in response to the generation of cytokines inside the humanbronchial epithelia cells were addressed.2.

Materials Phosphorite rocks were derived locally from the Qoseir area along the Red Sea in Egypt.It contains P 2O5(28 wt%), CaO (46 wt%), SiO 2(12 wt%), Fe 2O3(2 wt%), F (2.8 wt%), Na 2O (4 wt%), MgO (0.5 wt%), Al 2O3(0.8 wt%), and LOI (7 wt%).16992 |RSC Adv.,2 0 2 4 , 14, 16991 –17007 © 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of ChemistryRSC Advances Paper Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (99% purity) was applied during the modi cation of the structure with magnesium.The dissolution and precipitation processes involved using 40%pure nitric acid together with ammonium solution (25% NH 3; CAS number: 1336-21-6), both purchased from Sigma-Aldrich inEgypt.Ethanol (95%), b-cyclodextrin (>85%; MW 1153), powdered chitosan (MW 120,000; 85%), and acetic acid (99.8%)of analytical grade were purchased and used in the hybridizingprocedures.Levo oxacin antibiotic (C 18H20N3O4F) (LVX) of 98% purity was used in the cytotoxic, loading, and release studies.2.2.
Synthesis of carriers 2.2.1. Synthesis of magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite (Mg$HAP).By using the dissolution –precipitation method described by Okasha et al.,41Mg$HAP was produced successfully.The phosphorite starting materials were initially ground to obtainfractions with a size ranging from 25 to 150 mm.Following this, the resulting fractions (15 g) were completely dissolved in HNO 3 (200 mL; 1 M) using a magnetic stirrer for 24 h at a temperature of343 K.Silicate minerals were removed by ltration, leading to the retention of a solution consisting mainly of Ca 2+and PO 43−as soluble ions.During the subsequent two hours of stirring, the Mgprecursor (10 g) was mixed and dissolved e ﬀectively in the ltrate.Aer that, the resulting mixture was progressively mixed with the NH 4OH solution until the e ﬀective formation of a white-colored precipitate comprising the obtained HAP phase.
Followinga day of keeping the synthesis equipment at ambient tempera-ture, the Mg/HAP fractions were obtained viaan additional ltration step. The produced Mg $HAP particles were subse- quently subjected to ve runs of washing steps and dried in am uﬄed oven for a period of ten hours at 373 K.2.2.2.Synthesis of chitosan/Mg $HAP (CH/Mg $HP) composites.Aer producing Mg $HAP, a homogeneous mixture of its particles was prepared by dispersing 2 g of the producedHAP in 50 mL of distilled water and treating the resultingsuspension with ultrasound waves at 240 W for 120 minutes.Then, 4 g of powdered chitosan was dissolved in 50 mL of diluted (0.1%) acetic acid, and then the obtained solution wasadded cautiously to the Mg $HAP suspension.The compounds have been blended using a magnetic stirring device at 800 rpmfor 24 hours, besides being subjected to ultrasonic waves ata 240 W intensity.
The mix was washed thoroughly, ltered to remove any le over acid, and subsequently dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 hours. It was later identi ed as CH/Mg $HAP.2.2.3.Synthesis of b-cyclodextrin/Mg $HAP (CD/Mg $HP) composites.The Mg $HAP particulates were functionalized with b-cyclodextrin following the procedure described by.42Theb- cyclodextrin powdered fractions (1 g) were stirred in approxi-mately 80 mL of ethanol using a magnetic stirrer (1000 rpm)over 3 hours till a slurry-like mixture developed.The synthe-sized Mg $HAP particulates (2 g) were pulverized in 100 mL of distilled water viastirring at 1000 rpm with the assistance of a 240 W ultrasound generator for 60 minutes.The Mg $HAP and b-cyclodextrin slurries were blended and homogenized by stir- ring at 1000 rpm over 24 hours.A er that, a further homoge- nizing stage was performed for 24 hours using an ultrasoundgenerator with a power of 240 W.
The hybrid particulates generated were separated from the residual solution using Whatman lter paper with a pore size of 40 mm. The resulting compound was washed with distilled water to neutralize theexterior of the developed CD/Mg $HAP composite and then dried at 60 °C for 12 hours for use in further testing processes.2.3.Analytical techniques Depending on the obtained XRD patterns, the level of crystal- lization and the prevailing crystalline phases were determined using a PANalytical-Empyrean X-ray di ﬀractometer across a measurement range of 0 to 70°.The key functional chemicalgroups of Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP were iden- tied using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR8400S; Shimadzu) in the frequency range of 400 cm −1to 4000 cm−1.SEM images were acquired using a scanning elec- tron microscope (Gemini, Zeiss Ultra 55) subsequent to applying thin gold coatings over Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP.
The assumed transformations in the morpholog- ical characteristics of Mg $HAP following the two distinct modifying procedures were successfully assessed with the SEMimages retrieved. The surface area and porosity of Mg $HAP, CH/ Mg$HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP were measured using a Beckman Coulter SA3100 surface area analyzer considering the resultingN 2adsorption and desorption isotherm curves.2.4.LVX loading studies The LVX encapsulation within Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/ Mg$HAP was evaluated with respect to the most key variables that can control the embedded LVX dosage and its highestloaded quantities.The investigation assessed the pH range of 3 – 10, encapsulating time frame of 1 to 22 hours, and LVX contentbetween 100 and 700 mg L −1as the key factors.The Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP particulates were thoroughly mixed with the LVX water-based solutions (50 mL) using a vortex rotator.
A er each test's equilibrium period, the Mg $HAP, CH/ Mg$HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP particulates were separated from the LVX solutions through ltration using Whatman lter paper. The levels of the remaining LVX were measured using an HPLCsystem (Merck/Hitachi).The residual LVX levels were used tocalculate the loading capacities of Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP in mg g −1according to eqn (1).The loading tests of LVX into Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP were per- formed three times, and the mean values with a standard devi-ation less than 2.2% were used in the investigated results.Loaded drug/C0 mg g /C01/C1 ¼ ðinitial concentration /C0residual concentration Þ/C2solvent volume carrier weight (1) 2.5.Release studies Using bu ﬀering uids (pH 7.4) at 37.5 °C, the LVX release behaviors of Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP were examined.The LVX-loaded particulates of Mg $HAP, CH/ © 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry RSC Adv.

The DISTEK dissolution equipment blended theLVX-loaded Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP particu- lates with the bu ﬀering uid over 120 hours at a rotating speed of 200 rpm.The samples from both the bu ﬀering uids (5 mL) were collected periodically from the bulk volumes of thereleasing uid, and an HPLC system (Merck/Hitachi) was used to evaluate them in order to follow the LVX di ﬀusing % out of Mg$HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP.The bulk releasing buﬀer was promptly re lled by adding the periodically taken samples to maintain the volume consistently throughout thewhole releasing duration.

Anti-in ammatory and toxicity 2.6.1.Cell lines and reagents.Human bronchial epithelial cells (NL20) were purchased from ATCC (American Type CultureCollection) and all tests were performed at the Regional Centerfor Mycology & Biotechnology, Al-Azhar University, Egypt.Ham's F12 media together with 0.1 mM amino acids, 2 mM L- glutamine, 10 ng mL−1EGF, 1 mg mL−1transferrin, 5 mg mL−1 insulin, 500 ng mL−1hydrocortisone, and 4% FBS were employed for the preservation of cells.2.6.2.In uence of the structures on the production of cytokines.NL20 cells were inserted into 24-well cultivation plates for 24 hours and then cultured inside a serum-freegrowing mixture for an additional 24 hours.
Following that,these cells were treated with approximately 10 ng mL −1of TNF- ato induce the generation of pro-in ammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, inside the NL20 layers. A er 48 hours of incubation, the cell culture media were collected and cleared.The levels of IL-6 and IL-8 generated were determined usingchemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) kits.The physiological e ﬀect of LVX-loaded structures on IL-6 and IL-8 release was investigated by injecting theblended materials together with TNF- ainto the cell cultivation medium at di ﬀerent doses.The viability of the cells was assessed using a resazurin viability test.2.6.3.In uence of the LVX-loaded structure on the viability of NL20.The cells were cultured in a new growth medium containing 5% resazurin for further 4 hours a er removing the previously used cell media.
Following the incorporation of thedye alongside the completion of the incubating time, the uo- rescence signals were measured at an excitation wavelength of 544 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Analyzed discrepancies between the two data were assessed to determinethe level of cell viability.The viability results for the untreatedcells were identi ed as 100%.2.7.Statistical analysis The tests were repeated thrice, and the results were expressed as mean±standard deviation (SD) (S.E.M.; n=3).The statistical evaluation's signi cance was determined by analyzing the ndings of variance (ANOVA) and paired examinations, imple- menting the value of *p< 0.05.3.Results and discussion 3.1.Characterization of the carrier 3.1.1.XRD analysis.The realized pattern of Mg $HAP indi- cates the e ﬀective formation of HAP with 11.8 nm crystallite size.It peaks were observed prominently at 26.28°, 28.63°,32.29°, 47.10°, 50.29°, and 64.28° (JCPSD 00-001-1008) (Fig.
1A).The noticeable di ﬀerence between the peaks' positions comparable to the HAP conventional pattern seems to be a consequence of the crystallographic impact of the imple- mented Mg 2+ions.43,44The diﬀraction peaks corresponding to the introduced polymer, which are situated at approximately10° and 22° angles, reveal that the integrated chitosan displayssemi-crystalline properties (Fig. 1B).XRD analysis of the CH/Mg$HAP blend clearly demonstrates the dominant peaks cor- responding to the Mg $HAP phase; nevertheless, they slightly shied towards lower positions (Fig.1C).One of the principal peaks of CH had to be eliminated, and a second peak was uctuated and paired with Mg $HAP key peaks, indicating an eﬀective integration between Mg $HAP and CH.The di ﬀraction pattern of b-cyclodextrin as a distinct phase reveals the highly Fig.1 XRD patterns of Mg $HAP (A), chitosan (B), CH/Mg $HAP (C), b- cyclodextrin (D), and CD/Mg $HAP (E).16994 |RSC Adv.

The irregular arrangement of bundlesalongside the manner in which they crossed each other formeda porous framework together with the crystalline pores thatalready existed within the framework of HAP (Fig. 2B).The Mg-HAP-bundled particles are highly ornamented with nano- exposed burrs.The Mg $HAP-forming bundles had an average diameter between 20 and 60 nm and an average length between50 and 250 nm.The lamentous nanoparticles inside each bundle exhibited a mean diameter that uctuated between 2 and 10 nm and a mean length that varied between 20 and morethan 100 nm.The SEM images of the produced particlescomprising the CH/Mg $HAP composite revealed signi cant blending between the CH polymeric structure and Mg $HAP particles (Fig.2C and D).The Mg $HAP grains signi cantly underwent reorientation and rearrangement as aggregatedparticles (Fig.2C and D).
This resulted in an irregular exteriorcomposed of intersecting particulates with varying geometriesand including a number of interstitial cavities as secondarynano-pores (Fig. 2D).The SEM photographs of the produced CD/Mg $HAP reveal a signi cant alignment and entrapment of the HAP crystals through the blocky frameworks of b-CD.This leads to the formation of aggregates that have various morphologies (Fig.2E and F).The Mg $HAP particles are arranged randomly throughout the polymer, yielding an uneven and rough surface Fig.2 SEM images showing the geometry and surface of Mg $HAP (A and B), prepared CH/Mg $HAP composite (C and D), and prepared CD/ Mg$HAP composite (E and F).Fig.3 FT-IR spectra of Mg $HAP (A), chitosan (B), CH/Mg $HAP (C), b- cyclodextrin (D), and CD/Mg $HAP (E).© 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry RSC Adv.,2 0 2 4 , 14, 16991 –17007 | 16995Paper RSC Advances that may increase the surface area and interface exposures.
A substantial interaction between both b-CD and Mg $HAP resul- ted in the development of an interconnected structurecomprising curved platelets or lenticular-like particles. Themorphological modi cations are associated with considerable changes in textural characteristics, particularly surface area.The original surface area of Mg.HPA (93.7 m 2g−1) increased dramatically to 101.3 m2g−1and 95.2 m2g−1aer including CH (CH/Mg $HAP) and b-CD (CD/Mg $HAP), respectively.3.1.3.FT-IR analysis.The FT-IR spectra of the synthesized hybrids, together with the mixed constituents, were investigatedto detect the variations in the chemical compositions across themodi cation procedures (Fig.3).The fundamental components of HAP were easily recognized through the spectrum results forMg$HPA.
The analysis con rmed the existence of O –H (3434.4 cm −1) and important phosphorus-containing groups, particularly asymmetrical P –Oo fP O 43−(1039 cm−1) and HPO 42−(871 cm−1), as well as symmetrical O –P–O (570 cm−1) and asymmetrical O –P–O (603 cm−1) corresponding to PO 43− (Fig. 3A).25,44 –46The spectral bands corresponding to chitosan that was incorporated inside the CH/Mg $HP blend displayed their prevalent bands, representing N –H (1547 cm−1), C –O (1040 cm−1), C–H (2925 and 1336 cm−1), C]O (1637 cm−1), and C–N (1402 cm−1)32,33(Fig.3B).The CH/Mg $HAP spectral patterns show notable variations in positions and intensities aer a successful integrating process, revealing complex bands that correspond to organic chitosan as well as inorganic HAP(Fig.3C).Chitosan possesses distinct functional groupsincluding C ]O (1640 cm −1), C –H (2925 cm−1), and C –N (1397 cm−1).
The HAP could be distinguished by its distinctive groups: PO 43−at about 1034 and 559 cm−1and CO 32−at roughly 2379 cm−1(Fig. 3C).The shi s in the positions and intensities of the FT-IR bands, together with the reduction in the spectrum of some important groups such as HPO 42−in Mg$HAP and N –H in chitosan, validate the signi cant interaction involving these chemical groups during the composite's formation.Theb-CD spectra revealed the corresponding bands of its structure as distinctive phases around 3376 cm−1(O–H), 2926 cm−1(asymmetric CH/CH 2bonding), 1666 cm−1(H–O–H deformation), 1482 cm−1(hyper ne C]H), 1000 cm−1(C–O), 1158 cm−1(glycosidic C –O–C), and 1200 cm−1(C–O–C stretch- ing) (Fig.
3D).38,39The CD/Mg $HAP spectrum demonstrates the existence of characteristic bands corresponding to the chemicalconstituents of Mg $HAP, involving OH at 3424 cm −1and P –Oa t 1040 and 571 cm−1, alongside the corresponding bands of b-CD including C ]H around 2905 cm−1, hyper ne C]H around 1468 cm−1,C]C around 1663 cm−1, and C –O–C around 1211 cm−1(Fig. 3E).The successful production of the CD/ Mg$HAP blended material is supported by its formation of such intricate organic and inorganic chemical bonds, along with major shi s in the positions of identi cation bands.The results conrm the substantial chemical interaction between both of these constituents.3.2.Encapsulation of the LVX drug 3.2.1.In uence of the encapsulation parameters3.2.1.1.E ﬀect of pH.Keeping the rest of the factors xed, the eﬀects of various pH levels (from 3 to 9) on the loading prop- erties were investigated [dose: 20 mg; LVX levels: 100 mg L−1; temperature: 20 °C; duration: 2 h].
It was established thatincreased pH levels signi cantly improve LVX's encapsulating properties (Fig. 4A).This could be detected between pH 3 (Mg$HAP (25.8 mg g −1), CH/Mg $HAP (30.5 mg g−1), and CD/ Mg$HAP (32.7 mg g−1)) and pH 8 (Mg $HAP (87.6 mg g−1), CH/ Mg$HAP (98.5 mg g−1), and CD/Mg $HAP (105.3 mg g−1)).At pH levels above 8, the three vehicles exhibited a noticeable decreasein their ability to accommodate additional soluble LVX mole-cules, which displayed a reversal impact under highly alkalineconditions (Fig.4A).This behavior can potentially be inter- preted by considering the ionizing features of the LVX mole- cules alongside the exterior charges of the particles investigatedas carriers.LVX in its soluble form was detected as a cationictype exhibiting a positive charge through pH levels below 5.These species were generated through the protonation reactionof the piperazinyl groups.
20The zwitterionic type of LVX was detected between pH 5 and pH 8.5.5,47At pH levels higher than 8.5, the LVX molecules were determined to exist as anions due to the predicted de-protonation characteristics of their carboxyl groups.48,49Acidic conditions do not seem favorable for the loading of LVX in its cationic state. It will encounter electro-static repellent forces against the positive-charged functionalgroups of the particles of the carriers impacted by protonationreactions under acidic conditions.50The deprotonated sites that exist throughout the surfaces of the carriers in alkaline solu-tions (pH > 8) repel soluble LVX ions that exist in the anionic types under these conditions.20Consequently, it was suggested that the loading pH should be adjusted between pH 7 and closeto pH 8 to be able to accomplish the most e ﬀective loading for LVX medication.3.2.1.2.Loading duration.
The in uence of the duration on the Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP loading perfor- mances was explored experimentally throughout a time frameof 1 –22 hours while maintaining all the remaining variables constant [pH: 8; volume: 50 mL; LVX level: 200 mg L −1; temperature: 20 °C; dose: 20 mg]. Throughout the course of thestudy duration, there was an obvious enhancement in the LVXloading e ﬃciencies by Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP in regard to the loading speeds and loaded amounts in mg g −1 (Fig.4B).The enhancement is noticeable between 1 and 6 hours for Mg $HAP and up to 10 hours for CH/Mg $HAP and CD/ Mg$HAP.A er these periods, further increasing the time frame of testing has very little or no impact on the rate of loading or the quantity of LVX loaded.The graphs demonstrate stablebehaviors with consistent results above these time frames(Fig.4B).
These qualities display the equilibrium situations ofthe HAP-based drivers of LVX, as well as corresponding equi-librium capacities (137.6 mg g −1(Mg$HAP), 189.7 mg g−1(CH/ Mg$HAP), and 221.8 mg g−1(CD/Mg $HAP) (Fig. 4B).The pres- ence of substantial quantities of functioning binding sites in the free forms throughout the beginning of the encapsulating operations could potentially be responsible for the noticedsignicant loading rates along with a rapid rise in the LVX- 16996 |RSC Adv.,2 0 2 4 , 14, 16991 –17007 © 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of ChemistryRSC Advances Paper loaded amounts.51The quantity and accessibility of the unoc- cupied sites throughout Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/ Mg$HAP are dramatically decreased as a result of the contin- uous occupation of them by LVX during the course of theexaminations.Therefore, as time progressed, the measurableencapsulation rate of LVX dropped drastically by the end of theperiod under investigation.
Moreover, the loading characteris-tics of LVX into the HAP-based carriers did not show notableimprovements. When all of the positions were lled with LVX molecules, their loading equilibrium conditions were obtained.52 3.2.1.3.LVX concentration.Various levels of LVX were examined to determine their impact on the loading qualities ofHAP-based carriers.The LVX contents ranged from 100 to700 mg L −1, while additional variables such as duration (22 h), temperature (20 °C), dosage (20 mg), pH (8), and volume (50mL) were maintained.The maximum performances andequilibrium behaviors of Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/ Mg$HAP mostly rely on the initially applied content of LVX.At elevated starting levels of LVX, the entire amount of embeddedLVX within Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP increased dramatically (Fig.4C).The LVX ions' driving forces and migra-tion characteristics were greatly enhanced, as they were presentat a notably high level within a certain volume.
This enhancesthe potential of collision and facilitates the chemical contactthat exists among the binding sites of HAP-based carriers and the drug's water-soluble ions. 34,53Subsequently, this enhances the LVX loading performance till de nite levels (400 mg L−1for Mg$HAP and 500 mg L−1for CH/Mg $HAP and CD/Mg $HAP) (Fig.4C).When the LVX levels exceed a certain point, anyfurther increase in the evaluated LVX content does not a ﬀect the detectable loaded amounts of medication, which typicallyrepresent the corresponding equilibrium phases of Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP (Fig.4C).Therefore, Mg $HAP, Fig.

The higher LVX encapsulating e ﬀectiveness of CH/Mg $HAP and CD/Mg $HAP versus Mg$HAP might be a consequence of some factors involving the increased surface area post-modi cation, the organophilic qualities of CH/Mg $HAP and CD/Mg $HAP, which enhance their attraction to LVX, and the extra bindingsites following the hybridization. 3.2.2.Loading mechanism 3.2.2.1.Kinetic properties3.2.2.1.1.Intra-particle di ﬀusion behavior.Three distinctive stages, lacking any crossovers with the curves' beginning points,can be detected within the intra-particle di ﬀusion curves comprising the encapsulating reactions of LVX inside Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP (Fig.4D).This demonstrates the cooperative mechanisms that are responsible for the loading of LVX in addition to the substantial impact of the medication ions' di ﬀusion pathways closer to the binding interfaces of Mg$HAP, CD/Mg $HAP, and CH/Mg $HAP.
53,54This could involve adsorption onto reactive receptors across the external surface,layered adsorption, intra-particle di ﬀusion, and the implica- tions of saturated or equilibrium status. 55The initial phase indicates the operation of exterior loading processes during theearly stages of the testing, while the number of sur cial-reacting receptors found controls the progression of the encapsulating outcomes (Fig.4D).56An additional phase was noticed by pro- longing the duration.This phase indicates the involvement ofseveral regulating pathways such as the in uence of layered loading actions by interior receptors and LVX di ﬀusion behav- iors.The third step was recognized as the predominant portionthat was associated with the LVX encapsulating equilibriumsituations of Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP (Fig.4D).This con rms the occupation or use of all the functional binding positions by the LVX ions introduced.
25,53The loading reactions that occur in this stage are regulated by many path-ways involving molecular and/or interionic attractions. 34 3.2.2.1.2.Kinetic modeling.The kinetic characteristics of the LVX encapsulating processes into HAP-based carriers aredescribed based on the fundamental hypotheses of pseudo- rst order (P.F.) (eqn (3)) and pseudo-second order (P.S.) (eqn (4)).The presented symbols of the equations including Q t(mg g−1), K1(1/min), Qe(mg g−1), and K2(g mg−1min−1) denote the quantity of loaded molecules at time t, rate constant of P.F.model, equilibrium loading capacity, and rate constant of P.S.model, respectively.The consistency that exists between theloading activities and kinetic theories of these two models wasexamined through non-linear tting, employing their describing formulas.The correlation coe ﬃcient ( R 2) and chi- squared ( c2) values were used as indicators of the model- tting accuracy (Table 1; Fig.4E and F).
Qt=Qe(1−e−k1$t) (3) Qt¼Qe2k2t 1þQek2t(4)The calculated R2andc2results imply that the kinetic aspects of the P.F. model better describe the LVX encapsulating activities within the three tested carriers, comparable to the P.S.theory.The actual equilibrium capacities (137.6 mg g −1(Mg$HAP), 189.7 mg g−1(CH/Mg $HAP), and 221.8 mg g−1(CD/Mg $HAP)) closely matched the mathematically predicted values derived bythe P.F.simulation (141.6 mg g −1(Mg$HAP), 195.1 mg g−1(CH/ Mg$HAP), and 229.5 mg g−1(CD/Mg $HAP), con rming the precision of the tting ndings.The immobilization of LVX inside these structures was mainly induced by physical mech- anisms such as van der Waals forces and electrostatic forces,depending on the kinetic aspects of the P.F.model.57,58Never- theless, the P.F.theory more accurately describes the loadingactivities versus the P.S.hypothesis; the tting results are still considerably compatible with the P.S.theory.
It was assumedthat particular chemical processes such as electron sharing,hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic bonding had a minor impact or provided some assistance throughout the processes of loading LVX inside Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/ Mg$HAP. 53,57The interaction of chemical and physical interac- tions resulted in the development of a layer of the loaded drugby chemical activities, which was then used as a base for theformation of another loaded layer involving physical activities.59 3.2.2.2.Isotherm properties3.2.2.2.1.Classic isotherm models.The equilibrium charac- teristics of loading LVX onto the di ﬀerent HAP forms as prospective carriers were analyzed using the Langmuir (eqn (5))and Freundlich (eqn (6)) models, together with the Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) (eqn (7)) criteria.
The declared symbols inthe equations such as Q e(mg g−1),Qmax(mg g−1),Co(mg L−1), Ce(mg L−1),b(L mg−1),Kf(mg g−1),Qm(mg g−1),b(mol2kJ−2), and3(kJ2mol−2) refer to equilibrium loading capacity, expected maximum capacity, initial drug concentration, rest concentra- tion, Langmuir constant, Freundlich constant, loading capacity, D-R constant, and Polanyi potential, respectively. The resultswere non-linearly tted using the described formulas of the models, and the level of match was established according to thecorrelation coe ﬃcient ( R 2) alongside chi-squared ( c2) values (Table 1; Fig.4G –I).Qe¼QmaxbCe ð1þbCeÞ(5) Qe=KfCe1/n(6) Qe=Qme−b32(7) Based on the given model- tting factors, it can be concluded that the insertion of LVX into the di ﬀerent forms of HAP exhibits Langmuir isotherm qualities instead of the Freundlichproposed theory.
As a result, LVX ions were evenly entrappedonto the exteriors of them, forming monolayer layers, by severalregularly and consistently dispersed reactive receptors. 25,56The favored sequestration of LVX molecules within Mg $HAP, CH/ Mg$HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP vehicles can be detected according to the computed values of RL parameter <1.0.The maximalhypothesized loading levels of LVX within Mg $HAP, CH/ 16998 |RSC Adv.,2 0 2 4 , 14, 16991 –17007 © 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of ChemistryRSC Advances Paper Mg$HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP were computed using the parame- ters of the Langmuir isotherm and found to be 218.6 mg g−1, 281.5 mg g−1, and 333.2 mg g−1, respectively.
The isothermal characteristics of the studied D-R model could provide insights into the energy variations across the surfaces of the three carriers, independent of their levels of homogeneity or heterogeneity.60Calculating the Gaussian energy ( E) according to the D-R simulation highlights the key loading mechanisms, whether they are chemically or physicallycontrolled reactions. The physical mechanisms displaya Gaussian energy below 8 kJ mol −1, but the chemical activities display levels exceeding 16 kJ mol−1.Gaussian energies ranging from 8 to 16 kJ mol−1indicate the presence of complicated systems or poor chemical processes.25,60The Gaussian energies for the loading of LVX within Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/ Mg$HAP are 6.89 kJ mol−1, 8.04 kJ mol−1, and 8.7 kJ mol−1,respectively (Table 2).
The ndings indicated a signi cant inuence of the physical mechanisms throughout the uptake of LVX by Mg $HAP along with a potential e ﬀect of ion exchange mechanisms (ranging from 0.6 kJ mol−1to 25 kJ mol−1). However, the uptake of these molecules by CH/Mg $HAP and CD/Mg $HAP demonstrate values within the reported limits of co-operated physical and week chemical mechanistic processesinvolving ion exchange reactions.3.2.2.2.2.Advanced isotherm models.Following the basic principles of statistical physics hypothesis, the speci ed improved isotherm models provide more understanding aboutMg$HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP as LVX vehicles with respect to their surfaces/medication ions interfaces.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry RSC Adv. ,2 0 2 4 , 14, 16991 –17007 | 16999Paper RSC Advances to energetic factors, both the loading behaviors and underlying controlled mechanistic processes were investigated (Fig.5;Table 1).The primary determinants of the tting levels were the determination coe ﬃcients ( R 2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE).Qe¼nNM 1þ/C18C1=2 Ce/C19n (8) The steric aspects encountered statistically included the existing and e ﬀective receptors density ( Nm (LVX) ) throughout the investigated HAP based carriers, the number of LVX ions thatwere entrapped into a single e ﬀective receptor ( n (LVX)), and their saturation loading levels ( Qsat (LVX) ).The assessed energetic factor represented the LVX loading energy ( E).The Nm (LVX) computed values expanded considerably a er the modi cation of Mg $HAP to form CH/Mg $HAP (115.8 mg g−1) and CD/ Mg$HAP (138.5 mg g−1), compared to the initial value of Nm (LVX)=88.03 mg g−1.
The integration of a greater number of active and unbound functional units corresponding tocombined chitosan and b-CD might be the reason for this, or it could be a consequence of the enhancement in the interactioninterfaces that arise in surface area. Following modi cations, the saturation levels of Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP increased drastically from 218.3 mg g −1to 281.4 mg g−1and 332.4 mg g−1, respectively.The total number of lled LVX ions into each reactive receptor throughout Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP ( n(LVX)) illustrates the substantial in uence of the modifying steps on the qualities of Mg $HAP interfaces as a drug vehicle, particularly by b-CD.Based on mathematical calculations, the number of LVX ions entrapped into each singlesite across Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP is 2.48, 2.43, and 2.4, respectively.
The values are greater than 1, indi- cating the vertical ordering of the loaded ions onto their external surfaces and their encapsulation through multi-molecular processes. 61,62The corresponding loading energies ( E) were calculated using eqn (9), employing the mathematically determined remaining LVX contents during the half saturation levels ( C1/2) and their solubility ( S) at temperature ( T): DE¼/C0RTln/C18S C1=2/C19 (9) The calculated binding energies for loading LVX throughout Mg$HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP were −4.69 kJ mol−1, −4.11 kJ mol−1, and−3.98 kJ mol−1, respectively.This supports the latest outcomes concerning the physical encapsulating ofLVX within the three structures.62The processes may include van der Waals forces with an energy change of 4 to 10 kJ mol−1, dipole forces with an energy change of 2 to 29 kJ mol−1, and hydrogen binding with an energy change less than 30 kJ mol−1.63,64 3.3.
In vitro release pro les The releasing patterns of Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/ Mg$HAP were evaluated by analyzing the levels of LVX mole- cules that di ﬀused out. The LVX di ﬀused% out of the tested HAP derivatives through the used releasing bu ﬀer shows signicant di ﬀerences in releasing rates with the expanding releasing periods.The release rates of LVX out of Mg $HAP, CH/ Mg$HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP exhibit rapid aspects that corre- spond to noticeable variations in the detected levels of LVXliberated (Fig.6).Following certain time intervals, the measur-able diﬀusing rates of LVX notably reduced, with no noticeable enhancement in the amounts liberated (Fig.6).At this point,Mg$HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP releasing activities were stabilized.The rapid di ﬀusion of LVX noticed throughout the initial release stages was ascribed to the abrupt desorption of loosely bound and physically trapped LVX ions out of the exterior receptors.
65–67Aer the complete liberation of weakly embedded LVX ions from their surfaces, the releasing behavior Fig. 5 Fitting of the LVX loading reactions with the monolayer model of one energy site.Fig.6 Release pro ﬁles of Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP structures.17000 |RSC Adv.,2 0 2 4 , 14, 16991 –17007 © 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of ChemistryRSC Advances Paper was regulated by strongly embedded ions along with the ions that were integrated in chemical complexes, in addition to the encapsulated LVX ions within the internal pores, whichhindered the di ﬀusion e ﬃciency.20,68,69 The releasing behaviors of LVX from Mg $HAP in gastric and intestinal uids were consistent for more than 200 hours.Around 50% of the tested LVX dose was liberated out of theMg$HAP framework a er 60 hours.Even a er 200 hours, no complete LVX-releasing levels were detected (83.3%) (Fig.6).
The hypothesized powerful hydrogen bonding that exists between the adsorbed LVX ions and the predominant reactivefunctional components of synthesized hydroxyapatite mightclarify the slow release behavior of Mg $HAP. 70This hinders the release of LVX ions out of the HAP framework, limiting theeﬀective administration of the drug within therapeutic levels.The release behaviors of LVX from CH/Mg $HAP exhibit more rapid features than those of Mg $HAP (Fig.6).Approximately 50% of the trapped quantity of LVX was released out of theframework of CH/Mg $HAP within 34 hours and the complete release required 160 hours.Hybridizing Mg $HAP with b-CD (CD/Mg $HAP) enhanced the liberation of LVX ions as compared to Mg$HAP but at a slower rate than that of CH/Mg $HAP; 50% of the LVX was liberated out of the CD/Mg $HAP a er 40 hours and LVX was entirely released within 200 hours (Fig.6).
Hybridizing Mg $HAP utilizing chitosan alongside b-cyclo- dextrin results in an enhancement in the release speed ofloaded LVX molecules. These biopolymers provide barriersacross the interfaces between the reactive binding groups ofMg$HAP and the adsorbed LVX drug's molecular framework.This blocked the expected hydrogen binding that normally Fig.7 Fitting of LVX release results with zero-order (A), ﬁrst-order (B), Higuchi (C), Hixson-Crowell (D), and Korsmeyer-Peppas (E) models.© 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry RSC Adv.,2 0 2 4 , 14, 16991 –17007 | 17001Paper RSC Advances occurs between the drug's framework and the OH-containing chemical groups of Mg $HAP, leading to fast di ﬀusion of the medication molecules.The uniform distribution of LVX ionsthroughout the polymeric chain matrix signi cantly enhances their di ﬀusing characteristics.
Moreover, the modi cation methods add more chemical functionalities, enhancing thepotential of LVX to be physically trapped onto such surface sitesor receptors. Gradually and cautiously di ﬀusing LVX as a form of chemotherapy is advisable under speci c situations when there is a need for extended contact and exposures among the administrated medication and cancerous cells.20,71Further- more, sudden and rapid administration approaches are advisedin particular situations when it is necessary to provide exactmedicinal dosages within short durations.The synthesized CH/Mg$HAP and CD/Mg $HAP composites might serve as promising carriers for LVX, providing a controlled delivery vehicle withexcellent encapsulation and release properties based on the adjusted ratios of the hybridized polymer.3.4.Release kinetic studies As indicators of the well-controlled mechanistic processes, kinetic analyses of the LVX releasing activities out of the prepared HAP derivatives were performed.
The releaseoperations were modeled using zero-order (Z-O) (eqn (10)), rst- order (F-O) (eqn (11)), Higuchi (H-G) (eqn (12)), Hixson-Crowell (H-C) (eqn (13)), and Korsmeyer-Peppas (K-P) (eqn (14)) kinetictheoretical models. The modeling processes were highlightedbased on the linear regression tting levels.20 Wt−W0=K0$t (10) ln(WN/Wt)=K1$t (11) Wt=Kht1/2(12) Wo1/3−Wt1/3=KHCt (13) Wt/WN=Kptn(14) The zero-order kinetic aspects suggest that the di ﬀusion activities of LVX through Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/ Mg$HAP carriers proceed at consistent rates, una ﬀected by the loading dosages.23LVX-loaded dosages into them signi cantly aﬀect the releasing performance according to the F-O assump- tion.The Higuchi kinetics concept suggests that di ﬀusion phenomena play a key role in releasing processes.35,72The diﬀusion activities following Higuchi kinetics were conducted Fig.

35,73 The R2values show that the releasing procedures of LVX outside the HAP derivatives follow the F-O kinetic model(Fig. 7B) instead of the Z-O kinetic model (Fig.7A), suggestingthat the quantity of loaded LVX signi cantly a ﬀects the release performance.The releasing characteristics match well withboth the Higuchi (H-G) (Fig.7C) and Hixson-Crowell (H-C)(Fig.7D) theories.The results also veri ed that the di ﬀusion and erosion processes cooperated throughout the release of LVX.Nevertheless, the releasing behaviors of CH/Mg $HAP and CD/Mg $HAP considerably more closely mimic the Hixson- Crowell kinetics, signifying the essential impacts of theerosion mechanisms.The signi cant correlation between the release tendencies and the Korsmeyer-Peppas model (Fig.7E),together with the computed di ﬀusion exponent ( n)a sa tting variable, supported the intricate mechanistic theory.
Thediﬀusion exponent ( n) results are beyond 0.45, suggesting that the releasing processes of LVX from the Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP,and CD/Mg $HAP carriers exhibit non-Fickian transport char- acteristics (Table 1). 51 3.5.Anti-in ammatory properties The eﬀects of free LVX molecules and their loaded forms in Mg$HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP on the production of IL-6 and IL-8 in NL20 cells are shown in Fig.8 and 9.Using LVXas unbound molecules lacking a mediator led to a decrease inthe formation of IL-6 and IL-8 generated within the NL20 cellsunder study (Fig.8).Moreover, the investigated structures ofMg$HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP exhibit slight reduc- tion impacts on the generation of IL-8 and considerable decreasing e ﬀects on the production of IL-6, but much lower than the reported in uences of the administration of free LVX (Fig.8).
The reducing impact was greatly enhanced by incor-porating LVX molecules inside the synthesized Mg $HAP, CH/ Mg$HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP nanoparticles as administration vehicles. The generation levels of the IL-6 cytokine diminishedby 93%, 95.75%, and 97.85% following the use ofLVX@Mg $HAP, LVX@CH/Mg $HAP, and LVX@CD/Mg $HAP at a dose of 300 mgm L −1(Fig.8).The amount generated of IL-8 cytokine inside NL20 cells decreased by 77.1%, 81.2%, and85.6% when treated with LVX@Mg $HAP, LVX@CH/Mg $HAP, and LVX@CD/Mg $HAP, respectively, at the identical dose compared with unloaded LVX molecules (Fig.9).The realized Fig.9 Inﬂuence of free CH/Mg $HAP (A), free CD/Mg $HAP (B), LVX-loaded CD/Mg $HAP (C), and LVX-loaded CD/Mg $HAP (D) in the production of IL-8 proin ﬂammatory cytokines within the NL-20 cells in comparison with free LVX and Mg $HAP.© 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry RSC Adv.

Moreover, theimplications of the biopolymer integration on inducing theproperties of Mg $HAP as carriers of LVX either in terms of the loading and release properties or the anti-in ammatory prop- erties are presented.3.6.Cytotoxicity properties The cytotoxic activities of Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/ Mg$HAP were evaluated prior to and subsequent to the loading of the LVX drug throughout various doses of the composites(100mgm L −1to 300 mgm L−1).This was conducted according to the cell viability levels reported through the MTT experiment.The cell viability results using Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/ Mg$HAP lacking LVX demonstrated the remarkable safety and biological compatibility of the synthesized composites asa medication administration method.
The highest cell viability values achieved a er evaluating the structures at a dose of 300 mgm L −1are 95.2% for Mg $HAP, 92.2% for CH/Mg $HAP, and 90.6% for CD/Mg $HAP. 4.Conclusion Magnesium-rich hydroxyapatite (Mg $HAP) was synthesized and blended e ﬀectively in bio-composites with chitosan (CH/ Mg$HAP) and b-cyclodextrin (CD/Mg $HAP) as potential carriers of LVX.CH/Mg $HAP (281.4 mg g−1) and CD/Mg $HAP (332.4 mg g−1) displayed better loading performances than that of Mg$HAP (218.3 mg g−1).The higher density of loading sites of CH/Mg $HAP (115.8 mg g−1) and CD/Mg $HAP (138.5 mg g−1) than that of Mg $HAP (88.03 mg g−1) and enhancement in the organic a ﬃnities and surface area illustrate that the loading of LVX is regulated by multi-molecular and physical mechanisticsteps considering the loading (<40 kJ mol −1) and Gaussian (<8 kJ mol−1) energies.The composites showed slow release proles (160 h (CH/Mg $HAP) and 200 h (CD/Mg $HAP)) but were still faster than Mg $HAP.
Both di ﬀusion and erosion processes cooperated during the release of LVX based on the kineticinvestigation. The anti-in ammatory performance of LVX against the formation of cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in theepithelia cells (NL20) was enhanced at a remarkable rate a er its loading into Mg $HAP, CH/Mg $HAP, and CD/Mg $HAP, in order.Conﬂicts of interest There are no con icts to declare.Acknowledgements This work was funded by the Deanship of Scienti c Research at Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, through theResearch Groups Program Grant no.(RGP-1444-0035)(2).References 1 L.Schaupp, A.Addante, M.Völler, K.Fentker, A.Kuppe, M.Bardua, J.Duerr, L.Piehler, J.Röhmel, S.Thee,M.Kirchner, M.Ziehm, D.Lauster, R.Haag,M.Gradzielski, M.Stahl, P.Mertins, S.Boutin,S.Y.Graeber and M.A.Mall, Longitudinal e ﬀects of elexaca or/tezaca or/ivaca or on sputum viscoelastic properties, airway infection and in ammation in patients with cystic brosis, Eur.Respir.J., 2023, 62, 2202153.2 L.de O.
