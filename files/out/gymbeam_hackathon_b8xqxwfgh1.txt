ARTICLE OPEN Identi ﬁcation of a highly stable bioactive 3-hydroxyproline- containing tripeptide in human blood after collagen hydrolysate ingestion Yuki Taga1✉, Yu Iwasaki2, Chisa Tometsuka1, Noriko Funato3, Yasutaka Shigemura2, Masashi Kusubata1and Kazunori Mizuno1 There are increasing reports demonstrating high bioavailability of 4-hydroxyproline (4Hyp)-containing oligopeptides after oral ingestion of collagen hydrolysate and their bioactivity.In contrast, no study investigates the fate of another collagen-speci ﬁc but minor amino acid, 3Hyp.Here, we identi ﬁed Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp tripeptide in human blood at high concentrations, comparable to other 4Hyp-containing oligopeptides, after ingesting porcine skin collagen hydrolysate.Additionally, Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp uniquely maintainedthe maximum concentration until 4 h after the ingestion due to its exceptionally high resistance to peptidase/protease demonstrated by incubation with mouse plasma.
In mice, oral administration of collagen hydrolysate prepared from bovine tendon, which contains a higher amount of 3Hyp, further increased blood Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp levels compared to that from bovine skin.Furthermore, Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp showed chemotactic activity on skin ﬁbroblasts and promoted osteoblast differentiation. These results highlight the speci ﬁc nature of the Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp tripeptide and its potential for health promotion and disease treatment.npj Science of Food (2022) 6:29 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-022-00144-4 INTRODUCTION The oral bioavailability of bioactive peptides released from food proteins is important to exert their bioactivity in vivo 1.M o s to ft h e orally ingested proteins/peptides are hydrolyzed into amino acids in the gastrointestinal tract and blood.However, recently, it has been revealed that various di- and tripeptides exist in the blood after oralingestion of collagen hydrolysate 2–6.
The blood concentrations of collagen-derived oligopeptides reach µM levels, signi ﬁcantly higher than those of other food-derived peptides7. The most major collagen-derived peptide in the blood is prolyl-4-hydroxyproline(Pro-4Hyp) 2, and the next is generally 4Hyp-Gly3.In addition, many types of oligopeptides, including Xaa-4Hyp (Xaa =any amino acids), Xaa-4Hyp-Gly, and Gly-Pro-4Hyp, have also been detected in theblood 4,6.These peptides have various biological activities, such as stimulating the growth of skin ﬁbroblasts3,8, promoting osteoblast differentiation9,10, and chemotactic activity on skin ﬁbroblasts, tenocytes, and peripheral blood neutrophils11–13.The collagen- derived bioactive oligopeptides possessing high oral bioavailability are possibly the major contributing factor to the bene ﬁcial effects of collagen hydrolysate ingestion on bone14,j o i n t15,s k i n16,a n do t h e r targets17, which have been reported by many groups, particularly in recent years.
The common feature of those collagen-derived oligopeptides detected in the blood is the presence of 4Hyp within the sequence. Prolyl hydroxylation occurs uniquely in collagenous Gly- Xaa-Yaa repeat sequences (Xaa and Yaa are any amino acids).Pro residues at the Yaa position are mostly hydroxylated to 4Hyp,accounting for ~100 residues per 1000 amino acid residues in collagen 18.Hydroxylation of Pro residues confers high resistance to peptidase/protease digestion of peptides19.Therefore, although orally ingested collagen hydrolysate is sequentially digested bygastrointestinal enzymes, some parts remain in the peptide form containing Hyp (~20 –30% of total Hyp) 20and are transported intothe blood mainly via peptide transporters in the intestinal brush- border membrane21,22.The absorbed Hyp-containing oligopep- tides are distributed to various tissues and ﬁnally excreted into the urine6,23,24.
In addition to 4Hyp at the Yaa position, another form of Hyp, namely 3Hyp, is generated at the Xaa position of the Gly-Xaa-Yaa sequences only if 4Hyp is present at the adjacent Yaa position25. Prolyl 3-hydroxylation is a very minor modi ﬁcation in skin type I collagen (~1 residue/1000 residues); however, the modi ﬁcation rate largely varies with the source (tissue and species) and collagen type25.While absorption/metabolism and biological activity of 4Hyp-containing oligopeptides, especially Pro-4Hyp,have been extensively investigated, few studies have focused on3Hyp-containing oligopeptides.The present study investigatedthe kinetics in blood, stability, and biological activity of Gly-3Hyp- 4Hyp tripeptide identi ﬁed to appear at high concentrations in human blood after oral ingestion of collagen hydrolysate.
RESULTS 3Hyp absorbed into the blood is mostly as the peptide form after oral ingestion of collagen hydrolysate Weﬁrst analyzed concentration changes of free and peptide-form 4Hyp/3Hyp in human blood after oral ingestion of porcine skin collagen hydrolysate using LC –MS in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. We used a derivatization method using 3-aminopyridyl- N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (APDS) 26to sepa- rate 4Hyp and 3Hyp, otherwise dif ﬁcult to discriminate in the biological ﬂuid, as described previously27.After the ingestion of collagen hydrolysate, it was con ﬁrmed that free and peptide-form 4Hyp in plasma increased (Fig.1a), and increases in both free and peptide-form 3Hyp were also detected (Fig.1b).
The majority of 4Hyp was in the free amino acid form, consistent with previous 1Nippi Research Institute of Biomatrix, 520-11 Kuwabara, Toride, Ibaraki 302-0017, Japan.2Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Domestic Science, Tokyo Kasei University, 1-18-1 Kaga, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8602, Japan.3Research Core, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan. ✉email: y-taga@nippi-inc.co.jpwww.nature.com/npjscifood Published in partnership with Beijing Technology and Business University 1234567890():,; observations2,4,20.In contrast, the plasma levels of peptide-form 3Hyp were interestingly higher than those of free 3Hyp, although the concentrations were relatively low compared to those ofpeptide-form 4Hyp.Furthermore, the peak point of peptide-form3Hyp was delayed compared to that of peptide-form 4Hyp (2 h vs.1 h).
Peptide-form 3Hyp largely maintained the maximumconcentration until 6 h, while the blood concentration of peptide-form 4Hyp completely returned to the basal level after 4h . Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp is the major peptide form of 3Hyp in the blood after oral ingestion of collagen hydrolysate We next sought to determine which kind of 3Hyp-containing oligopeptide is absorbed into the blood by using human plasmacollected 1 h after the ingestion of porcine skin collagen hydrolysate.Since 3Hyp is known to be present at the Xaa position of the Gly-Xaa-4Hyp sequence 25, we selected Gly-3Hyp, 3Hyp-4Hyp, Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp, and 3Hyp-4Hyp-Gly as conceivable di- and tripeptides containing 3Hyp.Using synthetic standards of those peptides as references, we found a high peak of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp in the plasma sample on MRM analysis (Fig.2c), while in others, only a slight or no peak was observed (Fig.2a, b, and d).
This ﬁnding suggested that most of the peptide-form 3Hyp appeared in blood after ingesting collagen hydrolysate is Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp. We con ﬁrmed that the peak observed in the plasma was certainly Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp, not Gly-4Hyp-4Hyp, by chromato- graphic discrimination of these peptides after APDS derivatization(Supplementary Fig.1).Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp shows persistently high blood levels after oral ingestion of collagen hydrolysate To evaluate the kinetic pro ﬁle in the blood, we analyzed Gly-3Hyp- 4Hyp and other major 4Hyp-containing oligopeptides, which wereselected based on the previous data 6, in the time-course human plasma samples by MRM analysis.A previously developed internal standard mixture of collagen-derived oligopeptides (SI-digest)4 was used for accurate quantitation.After ingesting porcine skin collagen hydrolysate, all the analyzed peptides were increased in plasma, and the most major oligopeptide in the blood was Pro- 4Hyp (Fig.3), as reported previously2,4,6.
Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp showed an obviously different pro ﬁle to other 4Hyp-containing oligopep- tides. The time to maximum concentration ( Tmax) of Gly-3Hyp- 4Hyp was delayed compared to that of other oligopeptides (2.63 h vs.0.63 –1.44 h; Table 1), consistent with the observation for peptide-form 3Hyp (Fig.1).While the concentrations of most of the di- and tripeptides returned to the initial level at 4 –6 h after the ingestion, that of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp remained high at the timepoints.The maximum concentration ( C max) of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp reached the submicromolar level, which was comparable to other 4Hyp-containing oligopeptides, except for several peptides such as Pro-4Hyp.Due to the persistently high plasma levels, the areaunder the concentration −time curve (AUC 0–6h) of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp resulted in the fourth highest value, next to that of Pro-4Hyp, Ala- 4Hyp, and 4Hyp-Gly.The concentrations and pro ﬁle of Gly-3Hyp- 4Hyp matched with those estimated as the total of peptide-form3Hyp in Fig.
1b, which indicates that most of the 3Hyp-containing oligopeptides absorbed into the blood were this tripeptide form. Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp has extremely high stability We hypothesized that the unique kinetic pro ﬁle of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp in the blood was due to its high stability because the presence ofHyp within the sequence confers peptidase/protease resistance 19.Synthetic peptides were incubated with mouse plasma at 37 °C to assess the stability as performed in previous studies19,28.4Hyp-Gly and Pro-4Hyp, both reported to have high stability3, were gradually reduced and ﬁnally to less than half of the initial amount after 48 h of incubation (Fig.4a).In contrast, Gly-3Hyp- 4Hyp was completely intact during the reaction period, demon-strating its extremely high resistance to peptidase/protease digestion.We further analyzed two sets of peptides (Gly-3Hyp and Gly-Pro; 3Hyp-4Hyp and Pro-4Hyp) to clarify which sequenceis essential for the stability of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp.
While Gly-Pro was rapidly diminished in the mouse plasma, Gly-3Hyp remained unchanged during the reaction (Fig. 4b).In contrast, 3Hyp-4Hyp was gradually degraded as well as Pro-4Hyp (Fig.4c).These results indicate that 3Hyp located at the middle position mainly contributes to the extremely high stability of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp.Oral administration of tendon collagen hydrolysate results in higher absorption of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp Type I collagen present in tendon has a higher amount of 3Hyp, which increases during the tissue development stage 29, relative to that from skin and bone30.Therefore, it was expected that ingestion of tendon collagen hydrolysate results in further higher blood levels of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp.To verify this, we puri ﬁed collagens from bovine skin and tendon to perform oral administrationexperiments using mice.
The puri ﬁed skin and tendon collagens similarly had high amounts of 4Hyp (~110 residues/1000 residues; Supplementary Table 1), while the 3Hyp content in the tendon collagen was low (3.2 residues/1000 residues) but fourfold higherthan that in the skin collagen (0.8 residues/1000 residues), consistent with the previous results 30. The skin and tendon collagens were further hydrolyzed with pancreatin, and the average molecular weight of the prepared collagen hydrolysates was con ﬁrmed to be similar (1880 andFig.1 Concentrations of free and peptide-form Hyp in human plasma after oral ingestion of collagen hydrolysate.Human plasma samples collected before (0 h) and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h afterthe ingestion of porcine skin collagen hydrolysate were analyzed by LC−MS in MRM mode with (total Hyp) or without (free Hyp) acid hydrolysis.Peptide-form Hyp was quantitated by subtracting thequantitative values of free Hyp from total Hyp.
a4Hyp and b3Hyp were separately analyzed by APDS derivatization. The data representthe mean ± SD ( n=8).Y.Taga et al.2 npj Science of Food (2022) 29 Published in partnership with Beijing Technology and Business University1234567890():,; 1771 Da, respectively).We monitored the peptide levels in plasma until 12 h after administering the two collagen hydrolysates tototally evaluate the kinetic pro ﬁle of the long-lasting peptide.In the case of Pro-4Hyp and 4Hyp-Gly, there were no signi ﬁcant differences between the administration of the skin and tendoncollagen hydrolysates (Fig.5a, b).In contrast, plasma concentra- tions of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp were apparently increased in mice administered the tendon collagen hydrolysate (Fig.5c).At 12 h after the administration, Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp still did not appear toreach the baseline level.
Signi ﬁcant differences between the two collagen hydrolysates were detected for the AUC 0-12 h and Cmaxof Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp, and the AUC 0–12 hbecame higher than that of 4Hyp-Gly when the tendon collagen hydrolysate was adminis-tered (Table 2). These results demonstrate that the plasma level of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp can be increased signi ﬁcantly depending on the source of the administered collagen hydrolysate.
Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp has chemotactic activity on skin ﬁbroblasts and promotes osteoblast differentiation Since the most major collagen-de rived oligopeptide, Pro-4Hyp, is reported to promote cell migration of skin ﬁbroblasts and differentiation of osteoblasts 9,11, we investigated whether Gly- 3Hyp-4Hyp has such biological activities at a concentration of 200 nmol/mL, which was determined based on the previousobservation that the maximum blood concentration ofcollagen-derived peptides reached up to this concentration in some human subjects after inge sting collagen hydrolysate (0.385 g/kg of body weight) 8,20. In the culture of human skin ﬁbroblasts using the transwell sy stem, Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp added to the bottom chamber signi ﬁcantly enhanced cell migration through the ﬁlter membrane compared to the control (~2.9- fold; Fig.6a and Supplementary Fig.2).
Although Pro-4Hyp and Gly-Pro-4Hyp, both previously exhibited ﬁbroblast chemotactic activity at relatively high concentrations (2.5 and 12.5 µmol/ mL)11, seemed to increase migrated cells, those alterations were not statistically signi ﬁcant under our experimental conditions. The effe ct of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp on differentiation of mouse pre-osteoblasts MC3T3-E1 was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and c ell mineralization.Similar to the chemotaxis assay, the ALP activity was signi ﬁcantly increased by Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp (~2.2-fold) compared to the control but not by other peptides (Fig.6b).Although an increase in ALP activity of MC3T3-E1 cells with Pro-4Hyp waspreviously observed by our and other groups 9,10,s t a t i s t i c a l signi ﬁc a n c ew a sn o td e t e c t e df o rt h ep e p t i d ei nt h i ss t u d y .Additionally, only Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp signi ﬁcantly enhanced miner- alization (Supplementary Fig.

Although the mechanism of which had been unclear, in 2005, 4Hyp-containing oligopeptides were found to appear in blood atmarkedly high concentrations after ingesting collagen hydroly- sate 2.After that, links between the bene ﬁcial effects of collagen hydrolysate ingestion and bioactivities of 4Hyp-containing oligo-peptides have been increasingly established mainly throughin vitro experiments 3,8–13,19,34,35.Furthermore, several animal studies have provided direct evidence that 4Hyp-containing oligopeptides, especially Pro-4Hyp, exhibit their bioactivitiesin vivo after oral administration 34–37.
In the present study, we found that 3Hyp-containing tripeptide, Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp, shows persistent high blood concentrations after oral ingestion of collagen hydrolysate. It was demonstrated that Gly-3Hyp-4Hyphas high chemotactic activity on skin ﬁbroblasts and promotional activity of osteoblast differentiation.Given the high blood concentration and the potent bioactivities, Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp possi- bly functions as a signi ﬁcant contributor to the bene ﬁcial effects of collagen hydrolysate ingestion.We showed that Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp possesses extremely high resistance to peptidase/protease by incubating with mouseplasma, while Pro-4Hyp and 4Hyp-Gly were slowly degraded.We speculate that aminopeptidase P is a critical enzyme for the slow but gradual degradation of collagen-derived oligopeptides, exceptfor Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp.Aminopeptidase P is ubiquitously found intissues and body ﬂuids, and catalyzes the cleavage of N-terminal X-Pro bonds, which are dif ﬁcult to cleave by other aminopepti- dases 38.
Although aminopeptidase P almost speci ﬁcally recognizes penultimate Pro, it was reported that small amounts of Pro andHyp were generated from Gly-Pro-Hyp 39, indicating that this enzyme potentially degrades Pro-4Hyp. In addition, slight cleavage of the Gly-Hyp bond of Gly-Hyp-Ala was also observedin the study (either 4Hyp or 3Hyp was not mentioned).Theseobservations suggest that aminopeptidase P can attack N-terminal X-Hyp bonds, albeit to a lesser extent.The plasma degradation assay demonstrated that the high stability of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp ismainly due to the Gly-3Hyp sequence.
However, in contrast to thecomplete stability of Gly-3Hyp dipeptide, 3Hyp-4Hyp dipeptide was gradually degraded in the plasma as well as Pro-4Hyp, suggesting that 3Hyp at the carboxy side of the cutting site canconfer even higher resistance to enzymatic digestion than 4Hyp.Despite the potential degradation of the 3Hyp-4Hyp sequence, Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp remains intact in the presence of the stable N-terminal dipeptide sequence, Gly-3Hyp. Sontakke et al.reported that Gly-Pro-4Hyp was ef ﬁciently transported across the intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayer rather thanFig.2 MRM chromatograms of 3Hyp-containing di- and tripeptides in human plasma after oral ingestion of collagen hydrolysate.a Gly- 3Hyp, b3Hyp-4Hyp, cGly-3Hyp-4Hyp, and d3Hyp-4Hyp-Gly were detected by LC –MS in MRM mode for respective standards (100 pg each) or deproteinized human plasma collected 1 h after the ingestion of porcine skin collagen hydrolysate.Y.Taga et al.
3 Published in partnership with Beijing Technology and Business University npj Science of Food (2022) 29 Pro-4Hyp, suggesting the involvement of active transporters in the intestinal permeation of this type of collagenous tripeptide22. Gly- 3Hyp-4Hyp may be ef ﬁciently absorbed into the blood across the wall of the intestine in a similar way.Yazaki et al.indicated thatcollagen-derived oligopeptides, such as Pro-4Hyp and Gly-Pro-4Hyp, were incorporated into the mouse skin after oral adminis-tration of collagen hydrolysate 5.In addition, several studies reported cellular uptake of collagen-derived oligopeptides, such as by skin ﬁbroblasts40, osteoblasts10, and tenocytes12.Tenocytes are suggested to internalize Pro-4Hyp through multiple pathways,including integrin-mediated endocytosis 12.
Collagen-derived oli- gopeptides delivered to tissues and subsequently internalized into cells would then exert their bioactivities by interacting with speci ﬁc partners, such as transcription factors41. The accumulation of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp in tissues after the ingestion of collagenhydrolysate and the internalization ef ﬁciency of this tripeptide into cells require investigations in future works.The abundance of 3Hyp was approximately 1/140 of 4Hyp in skin type I collagen (Supplementary Table 1).However, afterporcine skin collagen hydrolysate was ingested, Gly-3Hyp-4Hypappeared in human blood at high concentrations, which werecomparable to other 4Hyp-containing di- and tripeptides.Consistent with previous observations 2,4,20, the major portion of 4Hyp detected in the blood after the ingestion was the free aminoacid form.In contrast, we revealed that almost all of the 3Hypabsorbed into the blood was in the form of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp due toits exceptionally high stability.
This is the reason for the highconcentrations of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp in the blood despite the lowabundance of 3Hyp in the ingested collagen. Our data indicate theremarkable oral bioavailability of this unique peptide.The 4Hyp content hardly differs depending on the collagen source since this major form of Hyp is essential for maintaining thethermal stability of collagen 42,43.In contrast, the 3Hyp content dramatically varies with the tissue, species, and collagen type,although its biological role has remained unclear 25.We demon- strated that oral administration of pancreatin hydrolysate oftendon collagen, in which the 3Hyp content is higher than that inskin collagen, signi ﬁcantly increased the AUC and C maxof Gly- 3Hyp-4Hyp.This result suggests that selecting other sourcescontaining further larger amounts of 3Hyp leads to more high absorption of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp comparable or surpassing that of Pro-4Hyp.
We recently analyzed collagens from various speciesand showed that the 3Hyp content is particularly high ininvertebrate collagens 43, which can be candidates for the source to prepare Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp-rich collagen hydrolysate. It should be noted that endogenous tissue collagen could also generate non-negligible amounts of collagen-derived oligopep-tides, especially where tissue reconstruction occurs 44.It was reported that contents of Pro-4Hyp, Leu-4Hyp, and Gly-Pro-4Hyp in the mouse ear were signi ﬁcantly increased by 2,4-dinitro ﬂuor- obenzene-induced dermatitis compared to vehicle-treatedanother ear 44,45.In addition, an increase in Pro-4Hyp was also observed after wounding in mouse skin46.The local increases inFig.3 Concentrations of Hyp-containing oligopeptides in human plasma after oral ingestion of collagen hydrolysate.

4 npj Science of Food (2022) 29 Published in partnership with Beijing Technology and Business University collagen-derived oligopeptides in the in ﬂammatory and wound healing sites suggest that those peptides generated during tissueremodeling exert their biological activities associated with theevents. Indeed, a recent study reported that daily intraperitonealinjection of Pro-4Hyp decreased scar tissue formation in the skin of wound healing model mice 47.It is reasonable that collagen- producing cells, such as skin ﬁbroblasts and osteoblasts, are regulated by collagen-derived oligopeptides in an autocrine-likemanner in response to tissue damage.In addition, in the case ofGly-3Hyp-4Hyp, type IV collagen may also be the major supplier ofthe peptide in a paracrine- or endocrine-like manner to those cells,since the basement membrane collagen contains higher amounts of 3Hyp (more than 10 residues/1000 residues) 48.
3Hyp is a rare post-translationally modi ﬁed amino acid in collagen, and its biological signi ﬁcance is little understood25. However, in view of the stability and bioactivity of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp, 3Hyp possiblyfunctions as a signal generated after degradation of tissuecollagen in the form of the tripeptide.It has been long known that collagen-derived oligopeptides, including synthetic peptides and bacterial collagenase digests, arechemoattractive for various cells in vitro 11–13,49,50, which also suggests substantial involvement of degradation products ofcollagen in wound healing.Our data showed that Gly-3Hyp-4Hyphas chemotactic activity on skin ﬁbroblasts.Hyp is suggested to be an essential constituent for collagen-derived peptides tofunction as chemotactic stimuli for skin ﬁbroblasts 11.Therefore, the presence of two consecutive Hyp may be important for thechemotactic activity of Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp.
Indeed, the correspondingtripeptide with Pro at the middle position, Gly-Pro-4Hyp, did notshow a statistically signi ﬁcant chemotactic response. The differ- ence in the stability during incubation with cells may also affect the outcome.Similar discussions can be applied to the promo- tional activity of osteoblast differentiation by Gly-3Hyp-4Hypobserved here.Our in vitro data suggest the therapeutic potentialof this bioactive tripeptide for damage in skin and bone, bothshowing bene ﬁcial effects of collagen hydrolysate ingestion in several clinical trials 14,16,31.Although Pro-4Hyp deposited in tissue after oral administration of the peptide is reported to be furtherconverted to amino acids and other metabolites 24,45, Gly-3Hyp- 4Hyp would more effectively function in tissue owing to theexceptionally high stability.Further studies are needed to clarifythe fate and usage ef ﬁciency of the bioactive 3Hyp-containing tripeptide derived from orally ingested or endogenous collagen.

Ethics statement All animal and human studies were approved by the Experimental EthicalCommittee of Nippi Research Institute of Biomatrix.Preparation of time-course human plasma samples after oral ingestion of collagen hydrolysate The human study was performed under the supervision of medical doctors following the Helsinki Declaration.Eight healthy volunteers who providedwritten informed consent fasted for 12 h before the experiment and theningested 5 g of porcine skin collagen hydrolysate (PS-1, an averagemolecular weight of 3000 −5000 Da; Nippi) dissolved in 100 mL of water.Venous blood was collected from the cubital vein before (0 h) and 0.5, 1, 2,4, and 6 h after the ingestion.
Plasma was prepared by centrifugation ofthe blood at 10,000 gfor 10 min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until used for analysis. Quantitation of free and peptide-form Hyp in plasma Free and peptide-form 4Hyp/3Hyp were analyzed by subtraction ofquantitative values before and after acid hydrolysis as describedpreviously 4.In brief, the human plasma samples were deproteinized by adding three volumes of ethanol after mixing with acid hydrolysate ofstable isotope-labeled collagen (SI-collagen) as an internal standard 4.A portion of the ethanol-soluble fraction was dried using a centrifugalevaporator CVE-3100 (EYELA, Tokyo, Japan) to analyze free Hyp.Anotherportion was subjected to acid hydrolysis (6 N HCl/1% phenol, 110 °C for20 h in the gas phase under N 2) to analyze total Hyp (sum of free Hyp and peptide-form Hyp).The two types of samples were dissolved in 0.1 Msodium borate buffer (pH 8.8) and derivatized with APDS at 60 °C for10 min as described previously 27.
The derivatized samples were analyzed by LC –MS in MRM mode using a 3200 QTRAP hybrid triple quadrupole/ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA) coupledto an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The chromatographic separation was performed using a Hypercarb column (3 µm particle size, L × I.D.100 mm × 2.1 mm; Thermo FisherScienti ﬁc) at a ﬂow rate of 400 µL/min and a column temperature of 80 °C with a binary gradient as follows: 100% solvent A (0.4% formic acid) for2.5 min, linear gradient of 0 –50% solvent B (100% acetonitrile) for 7.5 min, 90% solvent B for 2.5 min, and 100% solvent A for 2.5 min.The MRMtransitions of APDS-4Hyp/3Hyp and APDS- 13C515N1-4Hyp/13C515N1-3Hyp are shown in Supplementary Table 2.
The plasma concentration of 4Hyp/3Hyp was determined using the peak area ratio of the nonlabeled analytesrelative to the corresponding stable isotopically labeled analytes whoseconcentrations in the acid hydrolysate of SI-collagen were predetermined.The concentration of peptide-form Hyp was estimated by subtracting theconcentration of free Hyp from total Hyp 4. Analysis of Hyp-containing oligopeptides in plasma The ethanol-soluble fraction of the deproteinized human plasma sampleswas dried using the centrifugal evaporator.For quantitative analysis ofcollagen-derived oligopeptides in the time-course samples, SI-digestprepared by sequential protease digestion of SI-collagen was mixed intothe samples as an internal standard before the drying procedure 4.The samples were reconstituted with 0.1% formic acid and analyzed by LC –MS in MRM mode using an Ascentis Express F5 HPLC column (5 µm particlesize, L × I.D.250 mm × 4.6 mm; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) 6.
The MRM transitions of Hyp-containing oligopeptides are shown in SupplementaryTable 2. The plasma concentration of those oligopeptides was calculatedby the peak area ratio of nonlabeled analytes relative to the correspondingstable isotopically labeled analytes whose concentrations in SI-digest werepredetermined.AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule.Peptidase/protease resistance assay using mouse plasma The stability of collagen-derived oligopeptides was assessed as describedpreviously 19,28.In brief, synthetic peptide mixtures (Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp/4Hyp- Gly/Pro-4Hyp, Gly-3Hyp/Gly-Pro, and 3Hyp-4Hyp/Pro-4Hyp) were mixedwith fresh plasma prepared from male ICR mice at 6 months of age (JapanSLC, Shizuoka, Japan) at a concentration of 20 µg/mL each.The sampleswere incubated at 37 °C for 4, 8, 24, and 48 h and then deproteinized byethanol precipitation.
The ethanol-soluble fraction was diluted with 0.1%formic acid and analyzed by LC –MS in MRM mode using the Ascentis Express F5 HPLC column as described above. Oral administration experiments of pancreatin-hydrolyzed bovine skin and tendon collagen hydrolysates using mice Collagen was puri ﬁed from the skin of an 18-month-old bovine (raised in Hokkaido, Japan) or Achilles tendon of a 30-month-old bovine (Tokyo Shibaura Zoki, Tokyo, Japan).The tissues were digested with pepsin (5 mg/mL in 0.5 M acetic acid) at 4 °C overnight after defatting in ethanol.Theextracted collagens were puri ﬁed by salt precipitation (0.7 M NaCl), and the precipitates were dissolved in 5 mM acetic acid.The content of Pro, 4Hyp,and 3Hyp expressed as residues/1000 amino acid residues was quantitatedby LC –MS in MRM mode after acid hydrolysis with SI-collagen used as an internal standard as reported previously 30.
The skin and tendon collagens were denatured to gelatin at 60 °C for 1 h and digested with pancreatin (1:100 enzyme/substrate ratio) at 37 °C andpH 8.1 (adjusted by NaOH) for 16 h. After heating at 100 °C for 5 min todeactivate the enzyme, the average molecular weight of the preparedcollagen hydrolysates was determined by size exclusion chromatographyusing a Superdex 30 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare,Piscataway, NJ, USA) as described previously 28.The pancreatin- hydrolyzed collagen hydrolysates were used for oral administration experiments using male ICR mice at 7 months of age (Japan SLC).A daybefore the procedure, their normal diet was replaced with a collagen-freediet (AIN-93M; Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan).The mice were administeredthe skin collagen hydrolysate or tendon collagen hydrolysate (500 μLo f 40 mg/mL solution dissolved in water, n=5 each) using gastric sonde.
Blood was collected from the tail vein before (0 h) and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,and 12 h after the administration. The plasma concentration of Pro-4Hyp,4Hyp-Gly, and Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp was measured by LC –MS in MRM mode after ethanol deproteinization with SI-digest as described above.Fibroblast chemotaxis assay The migration assays were conducted using the FluoroBlok transwellsystem.Phenol red-free DMEM was supplemented with 2% GlutaMAX.Before the experiment, adult human skin ﬁbroblasts (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) were incubated with phenol red-free DMEM without FBS overnight.TheFluoroBlok 24-well plate insert was placed in the 24-well companion plate,and 75 µL of 100 µg/mL gelatin solution was added and dried in the insertat room temperature overnight to coat the ﬁlter membrane.The bottomTable 2.AUC 0–12 h,Cmax, and Tmaxof Pro-4Hyp, 4Hyp-Gly, and Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp in mouse plasma after oral administration of collagen hydrolysate prepared from bovine skin or tendon.

The data represent the mean ± SD ( n=5).Y.Taga et al.6 npj Science of Food (2022) 29 Published in partnership with Beijing Technology and Business University chamber was then ﬁlled with phenol red-free DMEM containing 200 nmol/ mL of Pro-4Hyp, Gly-Pro-4Hyp, or Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp without FBS.As a control, distilled water was added in equal volume to the peptide solutions.FBS added at a concentration of 2% was used as a positive control, andsigniﬁcant cell migration was con ﬁrmed (data not shown).
Cells suspended in phenol red-free DMEM without FBS were seeded onto the ﬁlter membrane of the insert (4 × 10 4cells/well). After incubation for 18 h, the cells that migrated and adhered to the lower surface of the ﬁlter were labeled with 5 µM calcein-AM added to the bottom chamber for 30 min in the incubator.The labeled cells were detected by a BZ-X800 ﬂuorescence microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) at 470/525 nm (Ex/Em).Sevenmeasurement areas at 100 × magni ﬁcation were arbitrarily selected, and the number of migrated cells whose size was >200 µm 2was counted using the Hybrid Cell Count application (Keyence analysis software).Osteoblast differentiation assay The effect of collagen-derived oligopeptides on osteoblast differentiationwas assessed by ALP activity and mineralization of the mouse pre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 (Riken Cell Bank, Ibaraki, Japan) as described previously 10.
In brief, for ALP assay, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in osteogenic differentiation medium ( α-MEM containing 10% dialyzed FBS, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 100 µg/mL L-ascorbic acid) with 200 nmol/mL of Pro-4Hyp, Gly-Pro-4Hyp, or Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp for 6 days. After washing, ﬁxing, and permeabilizing the cells, NBT/BCIP working solution was added to stain the cells.Positive ALP staining areas weremeasured using ImageJ software (NIH; Bethesda, MD, USA).For the mineralization assay, MC3T3-E1 cells were similarly cultured in the osteogenic differentiation medium with 200 nmol/mL of Pro-4Hyp, Gly-Pro-4Hyp, or Gly-3Hyp-4Hyp for 7 days.Mineralization was measured by alizarin red staining using a calci ﬁcation evaluation set (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions.The absorbance at 450 nm of the dye solution extracted from the cells was measured with a FLUOstar OPTIMA-6 microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany).
Statistical analysis Statistical signi ﬁcances were evaluated by the one-sided Student ’sttest using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) inthe mouse oral administration experiments or by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett ’s multiple-comparison test using GraphPad Prism version 4.0c for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) in theﬁbroblast chemotaxis and osteoblast differentiation experiments. Pvalues less than 0.05 were considered statistically signi ﬁcant.All data are expressed as the mean ± SD.DATA AVAILABILITY The data that support the ﬁndings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.Received: 23 November 2021; Accepted: 18 May 2022; REFERENCES 1.Abeer, M.M., Trajkovic, S.& Brayden, D.J.Measuring the oral bioavailability of protein hydrolysates derived from food sources: a critical review of currentbioassays.Biomed.Pharmacother.144, 112275 (2021).2.Iwai, K.et al.
