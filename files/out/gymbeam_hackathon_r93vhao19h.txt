The reference genome of seed hemp ( Cannabis sativa ) provides new insights into fatty acid and vitamin E synthesis Dear Editor, Hemp ( Cannabis sativa L.) (2n = 20) is an annual herb of the Can- nabaceae family, mostly dioecious and occasionally monoecious (Van et al., 2011 ;Long et al., 2017 ).A major source of food, textiles, and oilseed, it is believed to have originated in centralAsia and spread rapidly throughout Asia and Europe ( Andre et al., 2016 ;Braich et al., 2019 ;Gao et al., 2020 ).Depending on its usage and cannabinoid content, cannabis is classiﬁed asﬁber type (hemp or industrial hemp) or drug type (medicinal cannabis or marijuana) ( Struik et al., 2000 ;Hurgobin et al., 2021 ).As a type of industrial hemp, seed hemp is widely used to produce seed oil, but we still know little about the geneticbasis of its fatty acid and vitamin E synthesis.
Here, we generated a chromosome-level reference genome of the female seed hemp ‘yushe’, a major local cultivar in Shanxi Province, China, by integrating PacBio SMRT long reads and high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) map-ping ( Supplemental Table 1 ). On the basis of k-mer frequency, the genome size was estimated to be 783 Mb with a heterozygosity rate of 1.95% ( Supplemental Figure 1 ).The total length of the assembly was 794 Mb, with contig N50 andscaffold N50 values of 7.3 and 84.6 Mb, respectively (Figure 1 A).We assembled the contigs into 10 chromosomes by Hi-C physical mapping ( Figure 1 B,Supplemental Figure 2 , and Supplemental Table 2 ).Compared with the previously published hemp genome ( Grassa et al., 2021 ), this assembly had a much greater contig N50, suggesting that it had a higherassembly quality ( Supplemental Table 3 ).The long terminal repeat (LTR) assembly index for our assembly was 20.35, which meets the standard for a reference genome.
We predicted31 091 genes, 7987 non-coding RNAs ( Supplemental Tables 2 and 4), and 84.03% transposable elements ( Supplemental Table 5 ) in the seed hemp genome, and BUSCO analysis showed that 95.97% of the predicted gene models werecomplete ( Supplemental Table 6 ). In addition, about 92.59% of the RNA-sequencing reads from 18 samples were aligned to the genome ( Supplemental Table 7 ).We selected eight sequenced species, together with seed hemp, for analysis of gene family expansion and contraction.We usedOrthoFinder to cluster the protein sequences into families and found 3720 families shared by all nine species and 1181 families speciﬁc to seed hemp ( Figure 1 C).One hundred ﬁfty-one and 36 gene families had undergone expansion and contraction, respectively, in the genome of seed hemp ( Figure 1 D).
Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that thesigniﬁcantly expanded gene families were especially enriched inthe cellular component GO terms of ‘Retrotransposonnucleocapsid’, ‘Obsolete nuclear part’, ‘Lipid droplet’, and in the biological process GO terms of ‘Aromatic compound biosynthetic process’ and ‘Heterocycle biosynthetic process’(Figure 1 E and Supplemental Figure 3 ). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis, triterpenoid biosynthesis, andtryptophan metabolism were among the top 10 enriched pathways ( Figure 1 F).An evolutionary analysis of seed hemp and eight other species showed that seed hemp was closely related to Morus alba , with an estimated divergence time of 56 MYA (million years ago)(Figure 1 G).Calculation of fourfold degenerate site (4DTv) values for paralogous gene pairs revealed two signiﬁcant peaks (4DTv /C240.08 and /C240.6) in the seed hemp genome ( Figure 1 H).
Similarly, synonymous substitutions per synonymous sitevalues also showed two peaks ( Supplemental Figure 4 ). These results indicated that seed hemp has experienced two whole- genome duplication events.Identiﬁcation of LTR retrotransposons and characterization of their occurrence history are important for plant genome research.LTRs were the most abundant transposable elements in seedhemp and accounted for 54.84% of the genome ( Supplemental Table 5 ).In addition, seed hemp and Spinacea oleracea showed the same LTR burst events, indicating that these LTRinsertions occurred at 0.3 MYA in the two genomes ( Figure 1 I).Whole-genome comparison of seed hemp with two other Cannabis cultivars, wild hemp and marijuana, showed that 14 439 gene families were shared among all three genomes and 2636 were speciﬁc to seed hemp ( Figure 1 J).GO enrichment analysis revealed that 30 genes were signiﬁcantly enriched in the lipid catabolic process ( Figure 1 K and Supplemental Table 8 ).
KEGG enrichment analysis identiﬁed many speciﬁc genes related to oxidative phosphorylation,photosynthesis, and the proteasome ( Figure 1 L); these may be related to the characteristic abundance of antioxidant components in seed hemp. On the basis of homologous genes involved in lipid metabolism in Brassica napus , a model of lipid formation in seed hemp was pro- posed ( Figure 1 M).We identiﬁed 36 genes involved in the lipid biosynthetic pathway of seed hemp ( Supplemental Table 9 ).b-Ketoacyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase I (KASI) is Published by the Plant Communications Shanghai Editorial Ofﬁce in association with Cell Press, an imprint of Elsevier Inc., on behalf of CSPB andCEMPS, CAS.Plant Communications 5, 100718, January 8 2024 ª2023 The Author(s).This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).1Plant Communications Correspondencellll Figure 1.

Lysophosphatidic acid acyl-transferase (LPAAT), phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (PDAT2), fatty acid elongase (FAE), and phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) play roles in triacylglycerol synthesis(Barker et al., 2007 ;Xie et al., 2019 ). Gene expression analysis in four tissues revealed that expression levels of KASII and KASIII increased continuously during seed development; stearoyl ACP desaturase 2 ( SAD2 ),FAD2 .2,LPAAT , and PDAT2 were signiﬁcantly expressed in the late stage of seed development; and FAE4 and PAP3 were highly expressed in the early stage ( Figure 1 M).Comparison of the nutritional components of different edible oils showed that hemp oil was rich in unsaturated fatty acids and high in vitamin E (Supplemental Table 10 ).Sixteen genes related to the vitamin E biosynthetic pathway were identiﬁed in seed hemp, and their expression proﬁles were analyzed ( Supplemental Table 11 and Supplemental Figure 5 )(Chu et al., 2023 ).
Comparison of gene numbers related to fatty acid chain elonga- tion and desaturation in seed hemp and other species showedgene family expansions of the SAD and FAD genes (Supplemental Table 12 and Supplemental Figure 6 ). Changes in copy number of SAD andFAD genes may be the reason for the rich oil content of seed hemp.Phylogenetic analysis of SAD andFAD proteins in seed hemp and four other species showed that they could be divided into four and three subgroups, respectively ( Supplemental Figure 7 ).Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to combine the mod- ules with similar modules, and a total of 10 co-expression mod-ules were obtained ( Supplemental Figure 8 ).Module–trait associ- ation analysis showed that three modules were associated with seed development at different stages ( Figure 1 N and Supplemental Figure 9 ).
We found that genes of the MEbrown module regulate early seed development and include 56 genes related to fatty acid synthesis, eight of which (two FAEs, one PAP, two SADs, and three FADs) are involved in the fatty acid synthesis pathway ( Supplemental Figures 10 and 11). In addition, two genes ( Csa.DXS2 andCsa.HPPD1 ) are involved in the vitamin E biosynthetic pathway ( Supplemental Table 13 ).Seven genes related to fatty acid synthesis were identiﬁed in the MEblack module; these included Csa.F0XG018500 , which was predicted to encode SAD2, a key enzyme in theconversion of stearic to oleic acid ( Supplemental Figures 12 and13).The black module had the highest correlation with seed develop- ment at different times.
Genes with high connectivity in the blackmodule were identiﬁed, and three genes related to fatty acid syn-thesis were found, among which Csa.F01G019850 (KR) was the core gene ( Supplemental Figure 14 ).Csa.F0XG018500 (SAD2 ) andCsa.F04G007040 (KR) may also be key genes in the lipid synthesis pathway ( Supplemental Figure 14 and Supplemental Table 14 ).
