Serum vitamin B6 status was estimated based on levels of pyridoxal 5 ’- phosphate (PLP), 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA), and vitamin B6 turnover rate (4-PA/ PLP) detected by high-performance liquid chromatography. Survival status and corresponding causes of death were matched through the National Death Index records through December 31, 2019.Multivariate Cox regression model was adopted to assess the relationships between serum vitamin B6 status and the risk of mortality.Results: During a median follow-up period of 10.33 years, 507 cardiovascular deaths, 426 cancer deaths, and 1995 all-cause deaths were recorded, respectively.
In the multivariate-adjusted Cox model, the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CIs) for the highest versus the lowest quartiles of PLP, 4-PA, and 4-PA/PLP were 0.70(0.54-0.90), 1.33(0.88-2.02), and 2.01(1.41- 2.79) for cardiovascular mortality, 0.73(0.52-1.02), 1.05(0.71-1.57), and 1.95(1.25- 3.05) for cancer mortality, and 0.62(0.53-0.74), 1.05(0.82-1.34), and 2.29(1.87- 2.79) for all-cause mortality, respectively. Conclusion: Our study found that lower serum PLP levels were associated with increased risks of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality among the elderly population.And higher vitamin B6 turnover rate was associated with increased risks of cardiovascular, cancer, and all-cause mortality.

Therefore, identifying modi ﬁable factors that can change the nutritional status of the elderly is critical for maintaining their health and preventing or delaying premature death. Vitamin B6, an important nutrient, exists in the human body in six interchangeable forms: pyri doxal (PL), pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxamine (PM), and their respective phosphorylated derivatives ( 4,5).Among them, pyridoxal 5 ’-phosphate (PLP), as a coenzyme form of vitamin B6, is involved in the catalysis of more than 160 different functions ( 4,6).4-Pyridoxine (4-PA) is the major metabolite of vitamin B6, and approximately 40-60% of dietary vitamin B6 is excreted in this form ( 5).Currently, PLP, 4-PA, and 4- PA/(PLP +PL) (PAr) are the most common direct biomarkers for reﬂecting vitamin B6 status ( 6).Vitamin B6 participates in many biochemical reactions involving amino acid substrates ( 4).
For example, it affects homocysteine metabolism by in ﬂuencing the activities of cystathionine- b-synthase (CBS) and g-cystathionase ( 7). In addition, Vitamin B6 also affects immune function, in ﬂammation, antioxidants, and cellular signaling ( 8,9).Currently, several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that higher levels of vitamin B6 are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease ( 10), cancer ( 11), and all-cause mortality ( 12,13).Studies have indicated a high prevalence of vitamin B6 de ﬁciency among individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes ( 14).However, most of these studies investigated the relationship of vitamin B6 levels with mortality in patients with speci ﬁcd i s e a s e s( 15–18).Limited evidence is available regarding the health effects of vitamin B6 among the elderly.
To ﬁll this research gap and explore whether vitamin B6 may prevent or delay premature death in older adults, we conducted a prospective study to assess the relationships between serum vitamin B6 levels and the risks of cardiovascular, cancer, and all-cause mortality in the U.S. elderly.2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study population The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a nationally representative survey that assesses the health and nutrition status of the U.S.civilian population through personal interviews, laboratory tests, and standardized medical examinations ( 19,20).The survey begins by randomly selecting counties in the United States, then randomly selecting severalneighborhoods from each county, followed by the random selection of a number of families from each neighborhood, and ﬁnally randomly selecting family members based on age, gender, and race.The survey is conducted every two years.
Considering the complex survey design used f or NHANES, which includes oversampling, strati ﬁcation, and clustering, the data were weighted prior to data analysis according to the NHANES analysis guidelines ( 21). The concentration of vitamin B6 was measured from 2003 to 2010 in four cycles of NHANES.However, measurements of vitamin B6 levels from 2005-2010 could not be compared with those from 2003-2004 due to the lack of available adjustments.This study included three NHANES cycles from 2005 to 2010.Participants with the following characteristics were excluded from our study: a) Younger than 60 years of age at the initial survey; b) Missing data for PLP, 4-PA, or mortality outcomes; c) Presence of outliers on PLP, 4-PA and vitamin B6 according to z-core test.As indicated in Figure 1 ,a total of 4,881 participants were ﬁnally included.All participants have received written informed consent.
2.2 Measurement of vitamin B6 status Serum PLP (nmol/L) and 4-PA (nmol/L) concentrations were measured to estimate vitamin B6 levels. The serum PLP and 4-PA concentrations of NHANES participants were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography.Additionally, since there was no available serum concentration of PL, we used 4-PA/PLP instead of 4-PA/(PL+ PLP) to evaluate the turnover rate of vitamin B6.This is because the intraclass correlation coef ﬁcient (ICC) for 4- PA/PLP is similar to that of 4-PA/(PL+PLP) ( 22), at least among non-users of vitamin B6 supplements, and PLP has a strong association with PL ( 23).Therefore, the use of 4-PA/PLP can be considered as an effective surrogate for assessing vitaminB6 turnover.FIGURE 1 Flowchart of participant selection.Wang et al.
10.3389/fimmu.2024.1354958 Frontiers in Immunology frontiersin.org 02 2.3 Ascertainment of mortality Survival information was obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics by matching NHANES participants with the probability of a National Death Index (NDI) record through December 31, 2019. The NDI includes information on death records of individuals who have died in the United States since 1979, and their survival status as well as the corresponding detailed causes of death are recorded annually.The disease-speci ﬁc deaths were determined by the 10th rev ision of the International Classi ﬁcation of Diseases (ICD-10).The primary outcomes of our study were cardiovascular, can cer, and all-cause mortality.Cardiovascular mortality was de ﬁned as the ICD-10 codes for I00-I09, I11, I13, I20-I51, or I60-I69.Cancer mortality was deﬁned as ICD-10 codes for C00-C97.
2.4 Covariates Based on reviewing relevant literature ( 17,24), we selected the following covariates in the model: age (<70, 70-80 or ≥80 years), sex (male or female), drink (yes or no), smoke (never or former or current), education (Less than high school, High school or equivalent, and College or above), race ethnicity (Hispanic, non- Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Race-including multi- racial), physical activity (low, moderate, or vigorous), cholesterol (≥6.2 mmol/L or <6.2 mmol/L), and self-reported physician diagnosed cardiovascular disease (yes or no), cancer (yes or no), hypertension (yes or no) and type 2 diabetes (yes or no). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (meters squared).Moreover, Vitamin B6 intake (mg/day) was assessed by trained researcher using 24-hour dietary recall.
2.5 Statistical analysis Continuous variables that conform to a normal distribution, as determined by the Shapiro-Wilk test, are described using the survey-weighted mean (standard deviation, SD). Otherwise, they are described using the survey-weighted median (interquartile range, IQR).Categorical variables are presented as numbers and survey-weighted percentages.The Chi-square test or Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for the different analysis of survival status for categorical variables and continuous variables with skeweddistribution.The t-test was used for continuous variables with a normal distribution.Multiple imputation was used to impute these covariates with missing values ( 25).The survey-weighted Cox regression model was used to assess the relationships of PLP, 4-PA, and 4-PA/PLP with cardiovascular, cancer, and all-cause mortality.Biomarkers of serum vitamin B6 (i.e., PLP, 4-PA, and 4-PA/PLP) were categorized into quartiles, with the ﬁrst quartile as the reference group.
Three models were adopted: The crude model was not adjusted anything. Model 1 included adjustment for sex and age.Model 2 included adjustments for the variables in model 1 as well as for smoke, drink, ethnicity,education, physical activity and BMI.Model 2 was considered as the main model.We conducted survival analyses using covariate- adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves to explore the effects of 4-PA, PLP, and 4-PA/PLP quartiles on survival time in older adults; we also tested for non-linear associations between biomarkers of vitamin B6 status (log2 transformed) and the risk of mortality using restricted cubic splines (RCS), with four knots at percentiles 5, 35, 65, and 95.We conducted strati ﬁed analyses by age (<70 or ≥70 years), sex (male or female), BMI (<30 kg/m 2or≥30 kg/m2), smoke (never or former or current), and drink (yes or no) to examine whether these relationships were modi ﬁed by these potential modi ﬁers.
We explored the interactions of PLP, 4-PA, and 4-PA/PLP with the modi ﬁer by adding a multiplicative interaction term (i.e., quartiles PLP, 4-PA, or 4-PA/PLP parameter * potential modi ﬁers). To examine the robustness of the result, two sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) further adjustment for common chronic diseases and dietary vitamin B6 intake based on model 2; (2) excluding patients who died within 2 years of follow-up.All statistical analyses and graphs were performed using R version 4.3.1 ( ‘survey ’,‘plotRCS ’, and ‘gtsummary ’packages), and two-sided P values <0.05 was deemed to be statistically signi ﬁcant.3 Results 3.1 General characteristics A total of 4881 participants participated in our study, with a mean age of 70.70 (SD: 7.32) years, including 2,440 males and 2441 females.The median (IQR) concentrations of serum PLP, 4-PA, and 4-PA/PLP were 39.8 (56.1) nmol/L, 35.1 (53.9) nmol/L, and 0.9 (0.9), respectively.
During a median (IQR) follow-up of 10.33 (4.8) years, 507(10.4%) cardiovascular deaths, 426 (8.7%) cancer deaths and 1995 (40.9%) all-cause deaths were recorded, respectively. Thegeneral characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1 .I n general, participants who survive are younger, more likely to be female, never smokers, Non-Hispanic White, take more physical activity, have a higher level of education, intake of more vitamin B6, and less likely to have hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.3.2 Serum vitamin B6 status with cardiovascular, cancer, and all- cause mortality As shown in Tables 2 ,3, serum PLP concentrations were negatively associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.Additionally, serum PLP concentrations were negatively associated with cancer mortality when adjusted for age and sex (model 1, PQ4vs.Q1 = 0.002), but this statistical association disappeared when adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors (model 2).
No statistical association was observed between serum 4-PA concentrations and the risk of mortality. Furthermore, the vitamin B6 turnover rate, 4-PA/PLP, showed a signi ﬁcant positiveWang et al.10.3389/fimmu.2024.1354958 Frontiers in Immunology frontiersin.org 03 association with the risks of cardiovascular, cancer, and all-cause mortality.After adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors in a multivariate model (model 2), the weighted Cox regression results indicate that the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CIs) for the highest versus the lowest quartiles of PLP, 4-PA, and 4-PA/PLP were 0.70(0.54-0.90), 1.33(0.88-2.02), and 2.01 (1.41-2.79) for cardiovascular mortality, 0.73(0.52-1.02), 1.05(0.71- 1.57), and 1.95(1.25-3.05) for cancer mortality, and 0.62(0.53-0.74), 1.05(0.82-1.34), and 2.29(1.87-2.79) for all-cause mortality, respectively.The results of the covariate-adjusted Kaplan-MeierTABLE 1 Baseline characteristics of the study population.

We observed signi ﬁcant associations between PLP levels and the risks of cardiovascular (P=0.040) and all-cause (P<0.001) mortality, 4-PA levels and the risk of cancer mortality (P=0.047), and 4-PA/PLP ratio and risks of cardiovascular, cancer, and all-cause mortality (P<0.001 for overall association). No statistically signi ﬁcant nonlinear relationship was found between vitamin B6 biomarkers and the risk of mortality, except for an L-shaped nonlinearrelationship between serum PLP and all-cause mortality (P = 0.001) with an in ﬂection point at 39.54 nmol/L.3.3 Strati ﬁed and sensitivity analyses The results of subgroup analyses are presented in Supplementary Tables S1-S3 .The direction of the associations between biomarkers of vitamin B6 status and mortality was consistent across subgroups, although in some subgroups the association did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.Statistically signi ﬁcant interactions existed on some factors.
The inverse association between serum PLP concentration and all-cause mortality was more signi ﬁcant in individuals aged ≥70 years, and the inverse association between serum PLP concentration and cardiovascular mortality was also more signi ﬁcant in the male population. The positive associa tion between 4-PA/PLP and cancer mortality was stronger among drink ers, males, and individuals aged <TABLE 2 Hazard ratio (HRs) and 95% CIs for cardiovascular mortality across quartiles of vitamin B6 biomarkers among the U.S.older adults (N=4881; CVD-deceased = 507).Quartile of vitamin B6 biomarkers Quintile1 Quintile2 P-value Quintile3 P-value Quintile4 P-value PLP, nmol/L Range <23.0 23-39.8 39.8-74.6 >74.6 Median (IQR) 23.0(17.6) 30.7(8.7) 54.6(16.5) 118.0(79.1) No.

Furthermore, there was positive associations between 4-PA/PLP and the risks of cardiovascular, cancer, and all-cause mortality. After a series of sensitivity analyses, the results were robust.PLP levels are an effective marker f or assessing vitamin B6 levels ( 6).The inverse relationships of serum PLP concentration with all-causeand cardiovascular mortality is consistent with several previous investigations.For instance, Isi dor Minovi´c et al.observed in the Prevention of Renal and Vascular En d-stage Disease study that lower plasma PLP concentrations were assoc iated with higher cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality ( 10).Studies from European cohorts showed that study participants with h igher circulating levels of vitamin B6 had a lower risk of developing renal cell carcinoma and a higher survival rate after diagnosis ( 26).Pusceddu et al.
found that vitamin B6 deﬁciency was a risk factor for all-cause mortality in the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study ( 27). Paula Schorgg et al.observed that high PLP levels were associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality among individuals aged ≥65 years, but not in the broader population ( 28).However, a study from Caerphilly showed that vitamin B6 levels were associated with non-cardiovascular disease mortality in men, but not with cardiovascular or cancer mortality ( 29).Another study conducted on the ge neral population also observed a negative association between PLP and all-cause mortality, but found no association with cardiovascular or cancer mortality ( 24).These discrepancies may be due to the dif ferent study populations.With aging, the aorta stiffens due to incre ased collagen and decreased elastin, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease ( 30,31).

Interestingly, our results suggested that 4-PA/PLP was signi ﬁcantly and positively associated with cardiovascular, cancer, and all-cause mortality, but 4- PA was not associated with mortality risk. Cohort study from Norway indicated that plasma PAr is a good predictor of all-cause mortality risk in patients with coronary artery disease ( 33).The Hordaland Health Study (HUSK) showed that highe r PAr in general population was associated with increased overall cancer risk ( 34).Qianwei Cui et al.observed inverse associations betw een vitamin B6 conversion rates and the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in hypertensive adults (35).These studies support our ﬁn d i n g s .H o w e v e r ,Q i a n w e iC u ie ta l .also suggested that higher levels of 4-PA were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in hypertensive adults.Dandan Zhang et al.observed a positive relationship between serum 4-PA levels and all-cause mortality in individuals with T2DM ( 17).
Thesedifferences may be attributed to the study population and methods. Our unweighted analysis of the NHANES data also showed a positive association between 4-PA and all-cause mortality, but this association disappeared after conducting weighted analysis.According to the NHANES analysis guidelines, the re sults of the weighted analysis are more reliable.Furthermore, Paula Schorgg et al.observed that 4-PA/ PLP was associated with cancer and all-cause mortality in the elderly population, but not with cardiovascular mortality ( 28).They also noted that no statistical association was found between 4-PA and the risk mortality risk.This discrepancy may be attributed to their adjustment for variables related to in ﬂammation.The impact of vitamin B6 on mortality may be associated with in ﬂammatory processes, and potential collinearity among variables when adjusting models for inﬂammatory factors could reduce the predictive power of vitamin B6 for mortality risk.
The association of vitamin B6 levels with the risk of mortality may be mediated by its involvement in immune and in ﬂammatory processes. Studies have demonstrated that pyr idoxine supplementation signi ﬁcantly enhances the immune response in the elderly individuals ( 36), patients with renal failure ( 37), and critically ill patients ( 38).In the elderly, vitamin B6 depletion severely affects lymphocyte count, mitogenic response of T and B cell mitogens, an d interleukin-2 production, and B1 C1A1 B2 C2A2 B3 C3A3 FIGURE 3 Restricted cubic splines (5th, 35th, 65th, 95th nodes) for associations of serum vitamin B6 biomarkers and CVD (A), cancer (B), and all-cause (C) mortality in U.S.older adults.Adjusted for age, sex, smoke, drink, race/ethnicity, education, activity and BMI.BMI, body mass index; CVD,cardiovascular disease; PLP, pyridoxal-5 ’-phosphate; 4-PA, 4-pyridoxic acid.Wang et al.

BMI, body mass index; CVD, cardiovascular disease; PLP, pyridoxal-5 ’-phosphate; 4-PA, 4-pyridoxic acid.Wang et al. 10.3389/fimmu.2024.1354958 Frontiers in Immunology frontiersin.org 09 these immune markers return to normal with vitamin B-6 supplementation ( 39).In recent years, vitamin B6-dependent inﬂammatory pathways have been extens ively studied.Previous studies have demonstrated a negative associ ation between plasma PLP levels and several in ﬂammatory markers ( 40,41), such as the acute-phase markers c-reactive protein (CRP) and the ky nurenine/tryptophan ratio (KTR).The regulation of PLP-dependent en zymes and associated pathways in the in ﬂammatory response is in ﬂuenced by the distribution of vitamin B6 in tissues ( 42).During in ﬂammation, depletion of tissue-speci ﬁc vitamin B6 leads to low plasma levels of PLP ( 43).
Some of the increases in 4-PA/PLP levels may be attributed to the elevated demand for PLP in tissues, and 4-PA/PLP corrects for potential confounders that affect 4-PA and PLP proportionally, such as suppl ement intake, contributing to the robustness and speci ﬁcity of the 4-PA/PLP. In addition, several publications have con ﬁrmed that systemic in ﬂammation is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease development ( 44,45).The causal relationship between chronic in ﬂammation and cancer development has also been extensively studied ( 46).Chronic inﬂammation can cause cellular DNA mutation by inducing oxidative and nitrosative stress and can al so promote cancer development by affecting tissue repair, genotoxic stabi lity, invasion, proliferative response, and metastasis ( 46–48).Thus, the adverse effects of insuf ﬁcient circulating vitamin B6 on in ﬂammatory responses and immune processes may increase the risk of premature death.
Previous investigations have fo cused on the relationship between vitamin B6 and mortality in disease-speci ﬁc populations, with limited evidence from studies in older populations. In this study, we used a complex, strati ﬁed, multistage probabilistic sampling method to obtain a sample.Vitamin B6 status was exp ressed according to objectively measured serum parameters and adjusted for various potential confounders in the Cox regressio n model.This makes our estimates more robust and accurate.Several li mitations are also present in our study.First, our study was observational.Future trials and experimental studies are still needed to verify these ﬁndings and explore the underlying mechanisms.Second, we only had da ta measured at baseline and lacked interview data from multiple periods .T h i r d ,f a m i l yh i s t o r yo fc h r o n i c disease was considered a common confounder for which survey data is lacking.
In our sensitivity analysis, we further adjusted for prevalent chronic diseases to account for the potential impact of family history on the results. Fourth, serum concentrations of the vitamin B6 biomarker pyridoxal (PL) and 4-PA/(PLP+PL) (PAr) could not be obtained because our study was retrospective.However, 4-PA/PLP has a similar intraclass correlation coef ﬁcient (ICC) to 4-PA/(PL+ PLP) ( 22)a n dP L Ph a sa strong association with PL ( 23).5 Conclusions In this study, we observed inverse associations between serum PLP levels and the risks of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and positive associations betw een 4-PA/PLP and the risks of cardiovascular, cancer, and a ll-cause mortality.This study suggests that lower serum vitamin B6 levels and higher vitamin B6 turnover rate may be predictors of increased risk of mortality in older adults.
Maintaining high levels of vitamin B6 may be beneﬁcial in preventing premature death in the elderly.Data availability statement Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
