Methods: Four databases including PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to ﬁnd pertinent papers published on international scientiﬁc from inception up to July 15, 2024. We utilized STATA version 17.0 to carry out all statistical analyses (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, US).The random effects model was used to calculate the overall effect size ES and CI.Findings: Ten eligible review papers with 8610 participants studied the inﬂuence of magnesium on SBP and DBP.The pooling of their effect sizes resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of SBP (ES = -1.25 mmHg; 95% CI: -1.98, -0.51, P = 0.001) and DBP (ES = -1.40 mmHg; 95% CI: -2.04, -0.75, P = 0.0 0 0) by magnesium sup- plementation.In subgroup analysis, a signiﬁcant reduction in SBP and DBP was observed in magnesium intervention with dosage ≥400 mg/day (ES for SBP = -6.38 mmHg; ES for DBP = -3.71mmHg), as well as in studies with a treatment duration of ≥12 weeks (ES for SBP = -0.42 mmHg; ES for DBP = -0.45 mmHg).
Implications: The ﬁndings of the present umbrella meta-analysis showed an overall decrease of SBP and DBP with magnesium supplementation, particularly at doses of ≥400 mg/day for ≥12 weeks. ©2 0 2 4 The Author(s).Published by Elsevier Inc.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ) Introduction Systemic hypertension, a persistent elevation of the systemic arterial blood pressure (BP), is a highly prevalent condition and ∗Address correspondence to: Hamed Kord-Varkaneh, Department of Clinical Nu- trition and Dietetics, Faculty of Nutrition and Food Technology, Shahid Beheshti Uni- versity of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.∗∗Address correspondence to: Parsa Jamilian, School of Medicine, Keele University, Staffordshire, United Kingdom.E-mail addresses: Jamilianparsa@gmail.com (P.Jamilian), hamedkord39@yahoo.com (H.Kord-Varkaneh) .a major independent risk factor of mortality and cardiovascular disease.
1 Preventing and treating hypertension has become a sig- niﬁcant factor in decreasing the risk and burden of various dis- eases, thus reducing disease-related mortality. 2 , 3 However, inade- quate management of BP still remains one of the greatest individ- ual risk factors of all-cause mortality globally, 4 and each 10 mmHg rise in average systolic blood pressure (SBP) has been previously associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease risk by up to 16%.5 Dietary and lifestyle modiﬁcations play major role in managing BP.6 , 7 For this rea- son, the pressure-lowering effect of natural supplements has been https://doi.org/10.1016/j.curtheres.2024.100755 0011-393X/© 2024 The Author(s).Published by Elsevier Inc.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ) A.M.Alharran, M.M.Alzayed, P.Jamilian et al.
Current Therapeutic Research 101 (2024) 100755 widely studied, and beneﬁcial effects with minimal adverse effects have been discovered for many substances. 3 Magnesium is the fourth most common cation in the human body, 8 and a deﬁcient intake of magnesium has been associated with various diseases, including asthma, diabetes mellitus, hyper- tension, stroke, heart disease, hypertension, and even cancer.9 , 10 Therefore, magnesium has been proposed as a treatment for hy- pertension.11 By inducing the formation of nitric oxide and prosta- cyclin, 12 magnesium helps in modulating vasodilation, decreasing vascular tone and vascular reactivity.13 Magnesium also possess anti-inﬂammatory and as antioxidant properties 14 and interacts with calcium, 12 decreasing peripheral vascular resistance 15 and de- creasing blood pressure.
16 Observational epidemiological studies have reported a negative association between dietary magnesium supplementation and BP, 17 and various clinical trials have been conducted in the past years to study the effects of magnesium on BP, with inconsistent results published. 16 Even systematic reviews conducted on RCTs provided inconclusive results on the effects of magnesium on SBP and DBP.For instance, one meta-analysis reported a signiﬁcant reduction in DBP and a nonsigniﬁcant reduction in SBP, 18 while another meta- analysis reported that magnesium supplementation resulted in sig- niﬁcant reduction of SBP and DBP, 19 and a third meta-analysis re- ported only a slight decrease in BP.20 In patients with type 2 di- abetes mellitus a meta-analysis reported beneﬁcial effect of mag- nesium on BP, 21 while a second one showed a favorable effect on SBP but not on DBP.
22 Conﬂicting results were obtained from various studies and hence we conducted this umbrella meta-analysis of RCTs to pro- vide clear evidence and conclusion on the effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure. Methods This study was implemented based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guide- lines.23 Search strategy and study selection Four databases including PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to ﬁnd pertinent papers pub- lished on international scientiﬁc journals from inception up to July 15, 2024.
The search strategy was established us- ing the following keywords and MeSH terms: (((((“Magne- sium”[Mesh]) OR “Magnesium”[tiab]))) AND (((((((((Blood Pressure [Title/Abstract] OR Systolic Blood Pressure[Title/Abstract]) OR di- astolic Blood Pressure[Title/Abstract]) OR “Blood Pressure”[Mesh]) OR SBP[Title/Abstract]) OR DBP[Title/Abstract]))) AND (((“system- atic review” [Title/Abstract] OR “meta-analyses” [Title/Abstract] OR “meta-analysis” [Title/Abstract]))) (Supplementary Table 1). Inclusion and exclusion criteria We included articles in the present umbrella meta-analysis ac- cording to PICO criteria: Population/Patients (P: subjects treated with magnesium); Intervention (I: magnesium); Comparison (C: control or placebo group); and Outcome (O: SBP and DBP).Meta- analysis articles examining the effects of magnesium on blood pressure (SBP and DBP) in humans with reported effect sizes (ESs) and conﬁdence intervals (CI), were included in the current um- brella meta-analysis.
Moreover, observational studies, case reports, controlled clinical trials, prospective studies, studies with a “low quality” score, and articles in languages other than English were excluded. Methodological quality assessment and grading of the evidence Two independent researchers utilized the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR)2 questionnaire to eval- uate the methodological quality of eligible meta-analyses.24 This tool contains 16 items that require referees to answer “Yes,” “Par- tial Yes,” “No,” or “No Meta-analysis.” The AMSTAR2 list was cate- gorized into “high quality,” “moderate quality,” “low quality,” and “critically low quality.” We appraised the general strength and quality of evidence using GRADE based on the Cochrane Handbook of systematic reviews of interventions.
25 Study selection and data extraction Two independent investigators reviewed the papers to select those fulﬁlling the eligibility criteria and discrepancy was resolved by the corresponding author. The following items were extracted from the included articles: year of publication, ﬁrst author’s name, study location, sample size, magnesium supplementation dosage, and effect sizes and CIs for SBP and DBP.Data synthesis and statistical analysis We utilized STATA version 17.0 to carry out all statistical anal- yses (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, US).To calculate the overall ES and Cis, the random-effects model was used.Hetero- geneity among studies was assessed using the I2 statistic and Cochrane’s Q-test, with a P < 0.1 or I2 value > 50% regarded as signiﬁcant.Subgroup analyses were conducted to detect potential sources of heterogeneity based on the reported median predeter- mined variables, namely duration of intervention and magnesium supplementation dosage.
We applied sensitivity analyses to survey the inﬂuence of any particular effect size removal on the combined results. Formal Egger’s tests and funnel plots visual checking were also performed to detect publication bias, with a P -value < 0.05 regarded as meaningful.Results Study characteristics Figure 1 shows the ﬂow diagram of the literature search process.507 papers were recovered in the electronic database searches, out of which 178 were excluded for being duplica- tions.After screening the titles and abstracts of the remaining 329 publications, 315 articles were removed.Ultimately, 10 meta- analyses published between 2002 and 2021 were included in the umbrella meta-analysis, amounting to a total of 8610 partici- pants.21 , 22 , 26–29 , 19 , 30–32 Mean magnesium dose varied from 364 to 440 IU/day, and intervention duration ranged between 8.85 and 14.54 weeks.Detailed characteristics of the included meta-analyses are outlined in Table 1 .
Most of the included meta-analyses in this umbrella review were graded as having moderate to high quality; the results of the quality assessment of every article in each of the AMSTAR2 questionnaire items are presented in Table 2 . The effects of magnesium supplementation on systolic blood pressure 10 eligible review papers with 8610 participants studied the ef- fect of magnesium on SBP.Pooling their effect sizes based on the random effects model, a signiﬁcant reduction in SBP after magne- sium supplementation was discovered (ES = -1.25 mmHg; 95% CI: - 1.98, -0.51, P = 0.001) ( Figure 2 ).However, a signiﬁcant heterogene- ity among studies was detected (I2 = 92%, p = 0.0 0 0).In subgroup 2 A.M.Alharran, M.M.Alzayed, P.Jamilian et al.Current Therapeutic Research 101 (2024) 100755 Figure 1.Flow chart of the study selection process for the umbrella meta-analysis.
analysis, a signiﬁcant reduction in systolic blood pressure was ob- served in magnesium intervention with doses ≥400 mg/day (ES = - 6.38 mmHg; 95% CI: -11.56, -1.19, P = 0.016) and treatment dura- tion ≥12 weeks (ES = -0.42 mmHg; 95% CI: -0.78, -0.06, P = 0.020) (Supplementary Figure 1). The effects of magnesium supplementation on diastolic blood pressure Ten eligible review papers with 8610 participants scrutinized the inﬂuence of magnesium on DBP.The effect size pooling accord- ing to the random effects model discovered that magnesium sup- plementation signiﬁcantly decreased DBP (ES = -1.40 mmHg; 95% CI: -2.04, -0.75, P = 0.0 0 0) ( Figure 2 ), with a signiﬁcant heterogene- ity among studies (I2 = 93%, P = 0.0 0 0).
In subgroup analysis, a sig- niﬁcant reduction in diastolic blood pressure was found in mag- nesium intervention with doses ≥400 mg/day (ES = -3.71 mmHg; 95% CI: -6.88, -0.53, P = 0.022) and treatment duration ≥12 weeks (ES = -0.45 mmHg; 95% CI: -0.76, -0.14, P = 0.004) (Supplementary Figure 1). Meta-regression Subsequent analysis of the relationship between intervention duration (week) and magnesium supplementation dosage (mg/day) with SBP and DBP alterations revealed a signiﬁcant correlation (Supplementary Figure 2) ( Figure 3 ).3 A.M.Alharran, M.M.Alzayed, P.Jamilian et al.Current Therapeutic Research 101 (2024) 100755 Table 1 Study characteristics of included studies.Citation (First author et al., year) No.of studies in meta-analysis Mean BMI No.

Although cost-utility analyses are lacking, magnesium supplemen- tation could potentially reduce the economic costs of hypertension treatment. Suﬃcient evidence demonstrates the link between hy- pertension and various chronic diseases, 33 but further investiga- tions are warranted to study the effects of magnesium supplemen- tation on other chronic diseases.Magnesium is one of the most common minerals in the hu- man body, with 99% of it distributed intracellularly.34 The role of magnesium in reducing hypertension has been attributed to mul- tiple mechanisms of action, including acting as a calcium channel blocker, competing with sodium binding sites on vascular smooth muscle cells, decreasing intracellular sodium and calcium, enhanc- ing prostaglandin E, binding cooperatively with potassium, induc- ing vasodilation, improving endothelial dysfunction in diabetic and hypertensive patients.
35 Moreover, magnesium induces nitric ox- ide release from endothelial cells, which acts as vasoactive medi- ator and produces a synergistic effect with antihypertensive med- ications. 36 The effect of magnesium on osteopontin has also been proposed to be one of the mechanisms involved in inhibiting vas- cular calciﬁcation and reducing BP.37 According to our umbrella meta-analysis, magnesium supple- mentation resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in SBP (ES = -1.25 mmHg; 95% CI: -1.98, -0.51, P = 0.001) and DBP (ES = - 1.40 mmHg; 95% CI: -2.04, -0.75, P = 0.0 0 0).Similar results have been obtained by several meta-analyses, including a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs conducted by Asbaghi et al.with magnesium doses ranging from 36.49 to 500 mg/day and intervention duration of 4 to 24 weeks, which reported a signiﬁcant reduction of SBP and 5 A.M.Alharran, M.M.Alzayed, P.Jamilian et al.Current Therapeutic Research 101 (2024) 100755 DBP, 21 as well as one by Dibaba et al.
which reported that admin- istration of 365 to 450 mg/day of elemental magnesium resulted in a reduction of SBP by 4.18 mmHg and DBP by 2.27 mmHg, 27 and other meta-analyses. 38 In contrast with our study results, Verma et al.reported that magnesium supplementation provides a moderate beneﬁcial im- pact on SBP but not on DBP, 22 which could be because their meta- analysis on hypertension included only four studies, with a high heterogeneity among those studies.Song et al.reported that mag- nesium supplementation did not provide beneﬁcial effects on SBP and DBP, 30 however, the study population of the meta-analysis in- cluded only patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which could be the reason for this conﬂicting result; moreover, the main focus of the study was the effect of magnesium on glycemic control rather than blood pressure.
According to The American Food and Nutrition Board, the rec- ommended dietary magnesium intake for people aged 31–70 years is 420 mg/day for males and 320 mg/day for females. 39 In our subgroup analysis, a signiﬁcant reduction in SBP and DBP was ob- served in magnesium supplementation with doses ≥400 mg/day and treatment duration ≥12 weeks.In line with our results, a meta-analysis conducted by Asbaghi et al.reported in their sub- group analysis that magnesium supplementation at a dose of > 300 mg/day or with a duration of > 12 weeks provided signiﬁcant ben- eﬁcial effects on both SBP and DBP.21 In another meta-analysis, magnesium supplementation of > 370 mg/day resulted in SBP re- duction by 0.66 mmHg and DBP reduction by 0.57 mmHg.19 The reduction in BP due to magnesium supplementation could have beneﬁcial effects on cardiovascular outcomes.
A clinical trial reported that 0.8 to 2 mmHg reduction of SBP could help in de- creasing the risks of coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart fail- ure, with a 2 to 3 mmHg decrease of BP reducing the risk of stroke by up to 6 to 12%. 40 Hence, the reduction of BP by magnesium sup- plementation, although not enough to recommend magnesium as an antihypertensive monotherapy, could have clinical signiﬁcance when used as a dietary supplement in addition to other antihyper- tensive medications in subjects with hypertension.Clinical Implications Our umbrella meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials re- vealed that magnesium supplementation signiﬁcantly reduced SBP and DBP.Hence, magnesium supplementation can be used in con- junction with antihypertensive medications to cause a signiﬁcant decrease in blood pressure.Strengths and Limitations To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst umbrella meta- analysis to ﬁnd the effect of magnesium supplementation on BP.
We performed subgroup analysis based on the dose and duration of magnesium. Since our review included only meta-analyses of RCTs, bias was signiﬁcantly reduced.In addition, Egger’s test and visual inspection of the funnel plot revealed no publication bias.However, our review is not without limitations.Signiﬁcant het- erogeneity was found among the included meta-analysis, and the dose and duration of magnesium interventions in patients with speciﬁc comorbidities were not reported.Thus, we recommend that future studies focus on the effects of magnesium supplemen- tation on blood pressure in patients with comorbidities.Moreover, overlapping is unavoidable in any umbrella review which is an- other limitation of this review.Conclusion The ﬁndings of the present umbrella meta-analysis showed a small but statistically signiﬁcant decrease of SBP and DBP with magnesium supplementation, with signiﬁcant effects with doses ≥400 mg/day and duration ≥12 weeks.
Although the reduction of BP by magnesium supplementation is not enough to recommend its use as monotherapy for hypertension, it could have clinical sig- niﬁcance when used as a dietary supplement in addition to other antihypertensive medications in patients with hypertension. Fur- ther studies are required to determine the effects of magnesium supplementation on BP in patients with comorbidities.Declaration of competing interest No conﬂict of interest to declare.Funding None.Author Contributions A .M.A ., P.J., H.K.-V., and A .A .-Z.carried out the concept, design, and drafting of this study.K.P.and H.K.-V.searched databases and screened articles.M.M.A ., A .H.K., M.N.A ., O.E.E., M.A ., M.D.M., B.H.- W., and R.S.contributed to literature review, data collection, data interpretation, and reviewing of manuscript for editorial and intel- lectual contents.B.H.-W., H.K.-V., and A .A .-Z.supervised the study and performed statistical analysis.
