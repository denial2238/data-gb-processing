Methods: Thirteen patients of the undetermined form (IND), 13 of the mild cardiac form (CARD1) and 14 of the severe cardiac form (CARD2) of Chagas disease, and 12 with idiopathic heart disease (CARDid) were included. The cells obtained from peripheral blood were treated in vitro with vitamin D (1 × 10 −7M) for 24 h and cytokines were dosed in the culture supernatant.Results: Although it was not possible to demonstrate statistically significant differences between the groups studied, our data showed that the cells treated with vitamin D modify ( p< .05) the production of interferon ‐γ(IFN ‐γ) (decrease in IND), tumor necrosis factor ‐α(TNF ‐α) (decreased in CARD1 and Immun Inflamm Dis .2024;12:e1330.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/iid3 |1o f1 2 https://doi.org/10.1002/iid3.1330 This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

KEYWORDS Chagas disease, immune response, vitamin D 1|INTRODUCTION Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis is a chronic parasitic disease caused by the hemoflagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi . It is a neglected tropical disease and persists as a worldwide public health problem due to the high burden of morbidity and mortality.1,2 In a Brazilian study including 1263 patients with heart failure, Chagas disease was the cause of heartfailure in 10% of the patients.Ischemic heart disease was the main cause.3The pathophysiology of chronic Chagas' disease is not fully explored and clarified, presenting itwith high gravity and worse prognosis than heart diseases of other etiologies.Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain the observed cardiac tissuedamage better.Among these are the mechanisms of autoimmunity, 4parasite genetics,5and host genetics6 which translates into the elaboration of the host ‐specific immune response against T.cruzi .
Thus, it is proposed that individuals with the chronic cardiac form, despite maintaining an effective immune response against the parasite, would not have the ability to control thisinflammatory response, as individuals with the indeterminate form, and thus persisting an exacerbated inflammatory process with consequent deleterious effectsto the tissue. 7 Vitamin D is naturally synthesized in human skin through ultraviolet type B rays (UVB) or dietary sources.8 Active vitamin D is a fat ‐soluble hormone that primarily maintains bone and calcium homeostasis, although its role in the immune response has been increasinglystudied.9,10However, the known biological effects of vitamin D are mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and within the immune system, this receptor is found on cells such as T lymphocytes and macrophages.11Vitamin D has several effects on cells of the immune system.
In antigen ‐presenting cells, it can induce an inhibitory effect on the expression of II major histocompatibilitycomplex (MHC) molecules, costimulatory molecules, and other maturation ‐inducing proteins (CD1a andCD83). 10,12It promotes an increase in the chemotactic and phagocytic capacity of monocytes and cytotoxicityagainst tumor cells and bacteria, induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells capable of inducing T reg cells, inhibition of interleukin (IL) ‐12 p70 and proinflammatory cytokines (IL‐1 and tumor necrosis factor ‐α[TNF ‐α]) by monocytes and macrophages.13,14Vitamin D interacts by participat- ing in the regulation and differentiation of T cells byinhibiting the proliferation of T lymphocyte, the secre-tion of cytokines, and the progression of the cell cycle from G1a to G1b, increases the production of IL ‐4, IL ‐5, and IL ‐10.
The effect mediated by vitamin D is to inhibit IL‐12, interferon ‐γ(IFN ‐γ), and IL ‐2, the activation of antigen ‐specific T lymphocytes, and in natural killer (NK) cells. 13With regard to B lymphocytes, the presence of vitamin D does not contribute to the proliferation and secretion of antibodies and the production of auto- antibodies, as well as blocking the differentiation ofimmunoglobulin ‐producing B cells.
15,16But it is worth mentioning that, at normal levels, vitamin D can regulate B cells and antibody secretion.13 The literature shows evidence of how vitamin D deficiency would be involved in several chronic non- communicable diseases17‐22and suggests it as a new risk factor for cardiovascular disease.23Low serum levels of vitamin D have often been found in groups with terminal heart failure, reinforcing that this hormone plays an immunomodulatory role for these patients.24,25In Chagas disease, it has been shown that lower vitamin D levels suggest an association with the cardiac form.26 However, a large meta ‐analysis described that vitamin D supplementation was not associated with reduced majoradverse cardiovascular events or all ‐cause mortality, 27 and using vitamin D supplements is not recommended to reduce the risk of acute cardiovascular events.28Consid- ering the participation of vitamin D in cardiovascular health and its important function in the cells of the innate and adaptive immune response, and that immunebalance in Chagas infection is an essential factor in controlling morbidity, this study aimed to evaluate the2o f1 2 | OLIVEIRA ET AL .
cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) induced by in vitro treatment with vitaminD in different chronic clinical forms of Chagas disease. 2|MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 |Study population Forty ‐four ( n= 44) patients with Chronic Chagas disease were selected at the Chagas Disease and Heart Failure Outpatient Clinic of the Pronto Socorro Cardiológico dePernambuco (PROCAPE) of the Hospital Universitário Oswaldo Cruz (HUOC) of the Universidad of Pernam- buco (UPE), Recife, PE.Inclusion criteria were (1) havingthe clinical exams for the characterization of clinical forms, such as electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, chest and esophageal X ‐rays, and imaging of the colon when necessary (2) with a serological test to detect IgG reactive for Chagas infection, and (3) not reporting dysphagia and/or constipation.
The selected patients were distrib-uted into the following clinical groups: Indeterminate(IND) ( n= 13), mild cardiac (CARD1) ( n= 13), and severe cardiac (CARD2) ( n= 14) and were classified bycardiologists according to the II Brazilian Consensus on Chagas disease. 1All individuals with Chagas disease received etiologic treatment with Benznidazole (5 mg/kg/ day) between 3 and 5 years before the start of the study and were not carriers of pacemakers, infectious ‐parasitic diseases, or metabolic diseases, like another recent study by our research group.29Blood samples from uninfected but idiopathic heart disease (CARDid) individuals(n= 12) were used as study controls.Demographic and laboratory information (sex, weight, height, body mass index [BMI], total cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose) were obtained from medical records after screening withnursing staff (Table 1).
The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was obtained from the echocardiogram using the Teichholz or Simpson methods at random,depending on the examiner. 2.2 |Blood collection and serological diagnosis Nine milliliters of peripheral blood were collected using a vacuum system (Vacutainer®) containing sodium heparin to obtain PBMC.Five milliliters of blood were collected in TABLE 1 Clinical and laboratory variables of the study participants.

One milliliter of PBMCs (1 × 106/mL) was deposited in 48 ‐well plates and treated with cholecalciferol/vitamin D3 (Sigma ‐Aldrich), an inactive form of vitamin D, at a concentration of 10−7M for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2, previously established through time kinetics and concentrationalready used by other authors. 30‐32Furthermore, PBMCs were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (Culti- lab) (10 µg/mL) (positive control) and without treatment(negative control).Vitamin D was dissolved in ethanol and therefore a well with 0.1% ethanol (EtOH) (Sigma ‐ Aldrich) was used as a control.The cells were cultured inRPMI 1640 medium containing 1% L‐glutamine 200 mM, 1% sodium pyruvate 100 mM, 0.2% sodium bicarbonate 7.5%, and 1% antibiotic (penicillin 100 IU/mL andstreptomycin 100 mg/mL) (Gibco) and supplementedwith 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco).
After the culture period, the plates were centrifuged (200 × gfor 5 min at room temperature) and 300 µL of supernatant wasremoved and stored in microtubes at −20°C. 2.4 |Cytokine dosage in the culture supernatant Culture supernatants were collected for cytokine (IL ‐2, IL‐4, IL ‐6, IL ‐10, TNF ‐α, and IFN ‐γ) dosage by CBA (Cytometric Bead Array; BD Biosciences), according tothe manufacturer's instructions with modifications in thefinal reaction volume to 60 µL (20 µL of bead mix, 20 µL of sample, and 20 µL of detection reagent).The beads were acquired using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer(Beckton Dickson), located in the Nucleus for Technol- ogy Platforms (NPT)/IAM/Fiocruz, through the Cell- QuestPro software (Beckton Dickson) and analyzed inthe FCAP Array 3.1 software (Beckton Dickson).2.5 |Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of the data was performed using PRISM 8.0 Windows® software.To confirm the assump- tion of homogeneity of the samples, the Shapiro –Wilker test was used.
For comparison between culture condi- tions, Student's ttest for paired samples was used when the homogeneity assumption was confirmed, and Wil-coxon's test was used when the homogeneity assumptionwas not confirmed. To compare cytokine production between patient groups, we established an index (vitamin D‐treated cells/untreated cells) to normalize the data, in which, the analysis of variance test was used when the homogeneity assumption was confirmed and the Kruskal –Wallis test when homogeneity was not con- firmed.For the correlation analysis between %LVEF and cytokines, Pearson's correlation test was used when the homogeneity assumption was confirmed, and Spear-man's test when the homogeneity assumption was not confirmed.All statistical conclusions were made at a 5% significance level.3|RESULTS Table 1represents the epidemiological (sex, age, weight, height, and BMI) and laboratory (glucose, triglycerides, and total cholesterol) data of the groups studied.
As wecan see about these parameters there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. We did not find statistically significant differences between the groups when analyzing the inflammatoryand anti ‐inflammatory cytokine production profiles (Figure 1) in PBMC culture among patients with chronic Chagas' disease and idiopathic cardiac patients after invitro vitamin D treatment.However, when evaluating the effect of in vitro vitamin D treatment on PBMC from chronic Chagasdisease carriers and idiopathic cardiac patients (Figure 2), we observed statistically significant differences between cultures of untreated cells (C) and cultures of vitamin D ‐ treated cells (C+VD).Vitamin D induced decreased IFN ‐γ levels only in the IND group of subjects ( p= .0034) (Figure 2B).Regarding TNF ‐α, this hormone reduced the levels of this cytokine in CARDid ( p=.0 1 6 1 )a n dC A R D 1 (p= .0105) subjects (Figure 2E,G , respectively).
When analyzing IL ‐6, we found a statistically significant increase in the production of this cytokine after vitamin Dtreatment in all patient groups, when compared to untreated cells (Figure 2I–L). Interestingly, vitamin D induced a statistically significant decrease in IL ‐10 levels in all groups with cardiac manifestation (CARDid,4o f1 2 | OLIVEIRA ET AL .FIGURE 1 Cytokine production in PBMC culture among chronic Chagas' disease and idiopathic cardiac patients after in vitro vitamin D treatment.Horizontal bars represent the mean or median.The statistical tests used to compare cytokine concentrations between clinical forms were analysis of variance or Kruskal –Wallis.

Finally, there was no statistically significant correla- tion between the LVEF of Chagas disease carriers and cytokine production in cell culture treated in vitro withvitamin D (Table 2). 4|DISCUSSION Vitamin D is an important hormone for cellular immune responses and its serum levels are directly associatedwith macrophages increasing oxidative burst and inhibi- tion of inflammatory cytokines.33,34Few studies have evaluated the in vitro immunomodulatory effectsinduced by vitamin D.Most of them have been reported in autoimmune diseases.9,35This is the first investigation on the effect of vitamin D on cytokine levels in theculture supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic Chagas disease.Thus, itis a contribution of yet another link to the understanding of the immune mechanisms that lead to the distinct manifestations of the disease.
Considering that vitamin D is intrinsically related to the mechanisms of immune response regulation, we compared the production of cytokines by cells frompatients with indeterminate and cardiac clinical forms(including two different degrees of heart disease: CARD1, only patients with electrocardiographic alterations and CARD2 already with significant cardiac function impair-ment) through the analysis of a production index (treated cells/nontreated cells) for data normalization. In this analysis, our study did not observe statistically significantdifferences between the clinical forms of Chagas disease regarding the production of cytokines by PBMC treated with this hormone.Several immunological factors have been described as important in the development of the severe clinical forms of Chagas disease.Experiments using human samplesfound a cytotoxic immune response among chronicsymptomatic individuals, with a production of CD8+T cells and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF ‐αand IFN‐γ.
36‐39In turn, the high frequency of CD4+T lymphocytes and IL10, an anti ‐inflammatory cytokine, in carriers of the indeterminate form evidence a regulatory immune environment.36,38,40,41 In general, in innate immunity, vitamin D modulates the differentiation and functions of antigen ‐presenting cells by inducing a decrease in costimulatory moleculesand MHC ‐II and consequently a decrease in the interaction of these cells with T lymphocytes. This is reflected in the decreased production of IL ‐12 and IFN ‐γ and the increased production of IL ‐10.42In T cells, vitamin D suppresses T cell proliferation and modulates cytokine production and differentiation with various effects on different T lymphocyte subtypes.43Vitamin D promotes the change of Th1 (IL ‐2, IFN ‐γ, and TNF ‐α) and Th17 (IL ‐17 and IL ‐21) profiles to Th2 (IL ‐4, IL ‐5, IL ‐ 9, and IL ‐13).

Interestingly, only cells from IND patients responded to vitamin Dshowing decreased IFN ‐γproduction. On the other hand, vitamin D induced decreased levels of IL ‐10 in the cells of the cardiac patients, except the INDpatients.However, although in the group of patients with severe Chagas disease (CARD2), no statistically significant difference was observed, vitamin D inducedad e c r e a s ei nT N F ‐αproduced by the cells of the groups of patients with Chagas disease.IL ‐6p l a y sa ni m p o r - tant pleiotropic role in the survival of CD8+T cells,improving their cytotoxic activity when the immunesystem is activated.In our study, IL ‐6 in contact with vitamin D may be favoring the cytotoxic activity of TCD8+ lymphocytes.
45 Considering that the Th1/Th17 and Th2 paradigm is well established in human Chagas disease and that the effects of vitamin D are of suppression of the inflamma-tory response, we expected that the cells of patients with chagasic heart disease would respond more inefficiently to vitamin D treatment when compared to individuals ofthe indeterminate form, since it has been shown thatserum 25(OH)D3 levels were significantly lower in patients of the cardiac form when compared to those of the indeterminate form, suggesting an association ofhypovitaminosis with chagasic heart disease. 26Besides the classic functions of vitamin D for the organism (regulation of serum calcium and phosphorus levels andbone mineralization) this hormone has an important role in the regulation of the renin ‐angiotensin system, which is important in cardiovascular health.
46A study, that followed patients with cardiac insufficiency (IC) for 12 months, demonstrated a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in these patients and reinforced its immuno-modulatory role in IC. 25 Moreover, we believe that factors such as metabolic comorbidities (dyslipidem ia, diabetes, and obesity) could interfere with this result, leading us to analyzethese laboratory data.The distribution of BMI in our study was classified according to the parameters established by the World Health Organization.47It is important to show that all groups studied were diagnosed as overweight (BMI 25.0 –29.9 kg/m2).Obesity is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and chagasic heart disease.48‐50In addition, recent studies by our research group have demon- strated the profile of immunometabolism and in vitro infection with T.
cruzi in adipose tissue, which high- lights the influence of this tissue on the secretion of cytokines and inflammatory mediators in the presence of the parasite.51,52 Our results also showed that IND individuals had higher total cholesterol and blood glucose rates, being the only group above normal reference values, according to the Update of the Brazilian Guidelines on Dyslipidemiaand Prevention of Atherosclerosis 53and Brazilian Society of Diabetes Guidelines,54although no statistically signifi- cant difference was demonstrated with the other patientgroups. Obesity and diabetes have been associated with a decrease in vitamin D levels and the risk of heart disease,and studies have shown that patients with Chagas disease have a high prevalence of comorbidities.
55 However, the characterization of the clinical forms used in our study was more robust with the use ofechocardiogram data, being possible to stratify chagasic heart disease into mild and severe, which has already been used by our research group. 29,56 However, the results of this research also showed that all groups of patients had elevated levels of the cytokine IL‐6 (an important inflammatory mediator of the immune response) when comparing the treated and untreated PBMC cultures.As already mentioned, vitamin D induces suppression of IL ‐6 production.57However, other work has found that vitamin D intake caused anincrease or no significant change in IL ‐6 levels after supplementation in a population affected by dyslipide- mia, obesity, or diabetes.58,59However, one study has already demonstrated the same profile of increased proinflammatory cytokine in young children who sup- plemented vitamin D for 12 weeks to strengthen immunefunction.
60Therefore, more robust studies are needed to provide a better understanding of the association of IL ‐6 with vitamin D supplementation. The heart fraction, the ratio of ejected systolic volume to end ‐diastolic volume, can be assessed by measuring LVEF.61LVEF percentage (%LVEF) is determined via echocardiography.Notably, low values of this metrichave been associated with a poor prognosis for heart failure or heart disease, particularly in cases of Chagasic heart disease.The limit for a normal LVEF recom-mended by international guidelines is less than 52% for men and less than 54% for women.The cutoff below 40% is for moderate LV systolic dysfunction and below30% is for a severely depressed LV systolic function.62 However, our findings revealed no statistically significant8o f1 2 | OLIVEIRA ET AL .correlation between cytokine production (Th1/Th2) and % LVEF, as presented in Table 2.
The variability of studies reinforces the premise that vitamin D is an important immunomodulator and its deficiency is closely associated with a favoring ofcardiovascular diseases. 63‐65Thus, we believe that vita- min D supplementation in Chagas infection should be investigated further and that clinical trials with vitaminD supplementation in Chagas disease should be encour-aged as they are in autoimmune diseases.13,66 Finally, it has been shown that vitamin D deficiency and consequently decreased activation of the VDR couldplay an important role in cardiovascular disease since it would affect cardiac contractility, vascular tone, matura- tion, and collagen content of cardiac tissue, as the heartsof VDR knockout mice show high hypertrophy and profound changes in heart structure.67Other studies with VDR knockout mice showed stimulation of therenin –angiotensin –aldosterone system favoring hyper- tension, increased fluid intake, and left ventricular hypertrophy.
68,69It is worth noting that our study used culture supernatant from mononuclear cells treated withvitamin D, and thus the detected cytokine production is the product of this cell mixture. Knowing that vitamin D needs the VDR to perform its biological functions.10 Studies are needed to evaluate the expression of the VDR in immune cells of patients with Chagas disease, associating it with serum vitamin D dosage.5|CONCLUSION In vitro, treatment with vitamin D revealed a difference in cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells between patients with chronic cardiac andindeterminate clinical forms of Chagas' disease, with a decrease in IL ‐10 in cardiac patients.However, there were no significant changes in IL ‐2 and IL ‐4 levels after treatment.In addition, no significant correlation was found between LVEF and cytokine production, indicat- ing independence of the immunomodulatory effects ofvitamin D on cardiac function.
These findings suggest that vitamin D may affect cytokine production differently in patients with Chagas' disease, depending on theirclinical presentation. Given the possible importance ofvitamin D in immune regulation and cardiovascular health, further research into vitamin D supplementation in Chagas disease is needed.In addition, studiesexploring the expression of the VDR in immune cells of patients with Chagas' disease and its association with serum vitamin D levels would provide crucial informa-tion on the mechanisms underlying the effects of vitamin D in this context.6|LIMITATIONS Despite the limitations inherent in the study, we tried to minimize them to provide a solid basis for interpreting the results.All patients in this study have a history ofprevious parasitological treatment.
Although all of them had positive serological tests for Chagas disease, it is not possible to rule out that a group of the patients had aparasitological cure as takes years to decades untilserology becomes negative. This may have influenced the patient's immune response.However, clear criteria for chronic Chagas disease cure beyond a negativeserology are still missing.As for the nonexposure of PBMCs to the T.cruzi antigen during treatment with vitamin D, it is essential tonote that these patients had already been exposed to the parasite while infected (chronic Chagas disease patients), showing a specific cellular immune response to thedisease, even in the absence of the parasite.Furthermore, by the aim of the study, we sought to understand the effects of vitamin D in isolation without the interferenceof other immunological stimuli, such as exposure to theT.cruzi parasite.
Finally, other limitations of this study were the small sample size and the fact that the participants wererecruited from a single institution with no internal or external validation of the results.
