Unconditional logistic regression modeling was used for all analyses with the following candidate covariates: age, race, education, smoking and body mass index (BMI). Results: Compared to non-cases, participants with a diagnosis of SLE reported higher intakes of total omega-3 fatty acids and about the same intakes of omega-6 fatty acids.Overall, they had higher ratios of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids.When assessing odds ratios of SLE diagnosis by quartiles of omega-3 to omega-6 and DHA+EPA to omega-6, there was a positive significant trend (p trend=0.005).Additionally, among those reporting intake of fish oil, 87% had initiated fish oil consumption around the time of SLE diagnosis.SLE was more likely to occur among Black women compared to White women, among ever smokers compared to never smokers, among overweight women compared to women with normal/underweight, and among women 50–59 years compared to those 30–49 year old.
When a smaller 6 year follow-up study identified 64 incident SLE cases and assessed their omega-3 intake at baseline (6 years earlier and before the SLE diagnosis) their intake of omega-3 and fish oil was no different than among non-cases.

Further, baseline intake of omega-3 fatty acids was not increased among 64 incident SLE cases identified during 6 years of follow-up. Our surprising finding can best be explained by reverse causation.This could be an example of how public health information is assimilated and acted upon by a health conscious public.Introduction Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the joints, skin, kidneys, central nervous system, vascular system, heart, and lungs.1 Many of the symptoms experienced are a result of pain due to inflammation.
The Lupus Foundation of America estimates that approximately 1.5 million Americans have some form of SLE and more than 90 percent of the them are women.2 Further, Black women are about three times more likely to be diagnosed with SLE than White women.2 This is somewhat higher than what we found in our previous report.3 There is no known single cause; rather SLE has multi-factorial etiologies including genetic,4–10 environmental,6, 11–13 nutritional,14–16 ethnic,17 hormonal18, 19 and immunologic20 factors, thus leading to a loss of cell immunoregulation balance.1 Diet, specifically omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to the risk or prevention of SLE in susceptible persons. Two well-recognized members of omega-3 fatty acids are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) found in deep sea cold water fish.
They are the main components of omega-3 fatty acids and they decrease inflammation by inhibiting the production of cytokines, prostaglandins and leukotrienes that are produced by the analogous omega-6 derived arachidonic acid.21 In the typical Western diet, most people predominantly consume 20 times more omega-6 fatty acids than they do omega-3 fatty acids as the main source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).22 However, the absolute intake of omega-3 is not as good of a predictor of health as is the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6.23 Tissues metabolize PUFAs in a preferential order. Omega-3 fatty acids are used first, followed by omega-6 fatty acids.24 EPA is the omega-3 fatty acid that competes with the omega-6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid.25,21 Therefore, when alpha linolenic acids or fish oils are supplied by the diet, they are incorporated into plasma membranes first.
When they are not present, the body will use omega-6 fatty acids that are derived from linoleic acids.23 Charoenwoodhipong et al.26 found that in subjects with diagnosed SLE, there was a positive association between the ratio of dietary intake of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids and disease activity. However, the association was negative with intake of omega-3 fatty acids.Similarly, Aghdassi27 reported that when comparing fatty acid levels in red blood cells in controls with SLE subjects, who also had cardiovascular disease, those with SLE had lower levels of EPA and total omega-3 fatty acids as well as higher ratio of arachidonic acid to EPA.Likewise, when comparing fatty acid intake, Elkan et al.(2012)28 found that compared to controls, subjects with SLE had lower omega-3 intake.Also, there was a negative association between Oh et al.Page 2 Lupus .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 16.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript SLE disease activity and EPA and DHA levels in the adipose tissue and the omega-3 levels were lower among those with highest disease activity. In autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as SLE, T-cells are inappropriately activated which seem to challenge the host tissues.21 In studies of animals, autoimmune- prone mice were fed omega-3 fatty acids in order to investigate the association and mechanism that might be responsible for the associations observed in humans.29–36 They confirmed that there was a therapeutic effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in animals that have developed SLE.This indicates that there may be a similar therapeutic effect in humans as well.Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids have opposing functions in the body.
Omega-3 fatty acids appear to have an anti-inflammatory effect while omega-6 fatty acids increase inflammation.37 The eicosanoids produced from arachidonic acid act as inflammatory mediators in the human body. Omega-3 fatty acids are able to inhibit the production of the eicosanoids and then displace them in the cell membranes.
When the omega-3 derivatives are incorporated into the cell membranes instead of arachidonic acid, the red blood cells maintain more flexibility and produce more anti-inflammation mediators.21 The competition that exists between these compounds favors the non-inflammatory compounds and suppresses the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes that promotes inflammation.1 In addition, omega-3 fatty acids elicit an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect by reducing the level of C reactive protein (CRP) and other pro-inflammatory biomarkers, along with protecting against free radicals.1, 38, 39 It is reported that the anti-inflammatory activities are induced by the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and the promotion of antioxidant enzyme activities, in addition to a decreased immune effector activity and a reduced antigen presentation.40 Plant foods such as walnuts, flaxseed, sunflower seeds, hemp, corn, wheat germ, and green leafy vegetables contain alpha linoleic acid (ALA),41 another form of omega-3 fatty acids, which can be metabolized into DHA and EPA.24 In patients with SLE, the metabolism of essential fatty acids is altered resulting in decreased concentrations of ALA, DHA, and EPA in their bodies.42 Defects in the metabolism of omega-3 fats in SLE patients favor the production of inflammatory mediators resulting in autoantibodies that attack healthy tissues.27 Since omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids compete in the human body,1 it was important to investigate the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids rather than just examining omega-3 fatty acid levels alone.
The primary aim of this study was to assess the association between self-reported SLE and intake of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids intakes. The secondary aim was to investigate the association between SLE and the ratio of ALA to omega-6 and DHA+EPA to omega-6.Additionally, it is assumed that the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in numerous inflammatory conditions is publicly known.Therefore, we also assessed whether subjects Oh et al.Page 3 Lupus .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 16.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript diagnosed with SLE were likely to have increased their intake of omega-3 fatty acids as a result of being diagnosed with SLE.Subjects and Methods Study Population The study population includes female participants in the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2), a large prospective cohort study of over 96,000 Adventists living in the United States and Canada.
Participants were recruited between 2002 and 2007. Two-thirds of the AHS-2 participants are women, with about 25 percent non-Hispanic Black and the rest mostly non-Hispanic White.The study has been described in detail elsewhere.43 Our study is limited to 54,757 non-Hispanic Black and White females 30 years and older.Men were excluded as only 17 reported a diagnosis of SLE and thus the power was too low for meaningful gender-specific analyses.Another 1551 females were excluded due to improbable energy intake (<500 or >4500 kcal/day) and 2,907 were excluded due to missing values on the covariates used in the analyses, leaving 50,299 for the final analyses.Of these, 358 females reported ever having been physician diagnosed with SLE and, among them, 220 indicated that they had been treated for SLE during the last 12 months.Study Design This is a cross-sectional study which uses data that were collected from the AHS-2 cohort.
The study used a large validated baseline questionnaire which included sections for demographics, medical history, diet, physical activity, and dietary supplement use.43, 44 Specifically, it included both intake of fish-oil supplements and time frame for starting to take these as well as whether they were currently taking cod-liver oil. Outcome measure: A SLE diagnosis was ascertained through self-report on the baseline questionnaire.Each participant replied yes or no to a question on whether they “had ever been diagnosed by a physician with any of the following diseases?” followed by several options of how long ago the diagnosis had been given.One doctor-told diagnosis was SLE and a follow-up question was on whether they “had been treated for this condition over the last 12 months.” Those who indicated having been both diagnosed and treated during the last 12 months were considered to be a more symptomatic case of SLE than those who were not currently treated.
Main exposure: The validated food frequency component was the largest and most comprehensive part of the AHS-2 questionnaire and included 130 food frequency items broken down into 26 nutrient categories to include all foods and food groups commonly consumed. This questionnaire showed good validity for a comprehensive list of micronutrients and fatty acids when compared to 24h recalls.De-attenuated correlations for fatty acids ranged from 0.43 to 0.75 in Blacks and from 0.46 to 0.77 in Whites.45 The most common response format used was a sequence of 6 frequency categories: never, less than 1 time per month, 1 to 2 times per month, 1 to 2 times per week, 1 time per day, and more than 1 time per day.43 Information on omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs intake was obtained from Oh et al.Page 4 Lupus .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 16.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript the diet section of the questionnaire.
In addition, a separate section asked about supplements, including “fish oil” and “cod liver oil.” For fish oil, there was an additional question asking for how many years they had been taking the supplements. For cod liver oil, the question was a yes/no question on whether they were currently taking this supplement.The main exposure of interest was omega-3 fatty acid intake, including intake from supplements.The Nutritional Data System for Research (NDS-R) (Ver 4.06, The Nutritional Coordinating Center, Minneapolis, MN), was utilized by the AHS-2 to estimate omega-3 dietary intake from foods and from supplements.Total omega-3 fatty acids as well as individual intakes of ALA, DHA+EPA, and the ratios of omega-3, ALA, and DHA+EPA to omega-6 were estimated.Quartiles of the various ratios were used to examine trends in fatty acid consumption.
Among cases taking fish-oil supplements, we also assessed the timing of when these supplements were started and compared them to when they reported having been diagnosed with SLE. Lastly, based on a follow-up questionnaire administered to the AHS-2 population about 6 years after enrollment, we identified 64 incident cases of SLE, and were able to assess their pre-diagnosis consumption of omega-3 fatty acids based on the baseline questionnaire.Confounders: Potential confounding variables were identified through literature review and included: age, race, highest level of education achieved, smoking history, dietary patterns, and BMI.Age was divided into 3 groups: 30–49, 50–59 and 60 years and older.The two races used in the analyses were Non-Hispanic White and Non-Hispanic Black.The three levels of education included a high school degree or less, trade school or some college, and a bachelor’s degree or higher.
Since only 1.4% were current smokers at baseline, the smoking variable was divided into ever or never been a smoker. Dietary patterns included vegetarians (consuming fish, poultry, and meat combined <1/month), pesco-vegetarians (consuming fish freely, but poultry and other meat <1/month), and non- vegetarians (consuming non-fish meat once a month or more and all meats combined (fish included) more than once a week).BMI was broken down into three groups: under- or normal weight (BMI 15–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25–29.9 kg/m2) and obese (BMI 30–60 kg/m2).Statistical Analysis We performed univariate analyses on frequency distributions for non-treated and treated cases and non-cases with respect to age, race, education, smoking, dietary patterns, fish oil intake, and BMI.
Measures of central tendency using the median and inter quartile range (IQR) were utilized to compare the three analytic groups for various energy-adjusted intakes of fatty acids and the ratios of omega-3 to omega-6, DHA+EPA to omega-6, and ALA to omega-6 fatty acids. The residual method46 was used for all energy-adjustment.Chi-square analyses were performed to determine the differences among the two types of cases and non-cases in the categorical variables.The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to determine if there was a significant difference among the two different case groups and the non-cases for the median intakes of each of the fatty acids and the ratios of fatty acids.Oh et al.Page 5 Lupus .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 16.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript To determine associations between the various fatty acid ratios and the outcome groups, multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were conducted.
The independent variables included the quartiles of the ratios of total omega-3 to omega-6, DHA+EPA to omega-6, and ALA to omega-6 fatty acids. For all fatty acid intakes, both dietary sources and supplements were included.To account for confounding, the first model was adjusted for age, race, education, and smoking.The second model further adjusted for dietary patterns and BMI.Alcohol consumption was also a candidate covariable, but it did not meaningfully change the main effect odds ratios and therefore was not included in the final model.To estimate when SLE patients started taking fish oil supplements, we created a crosstab between years since SLE diagnosis and the duration of fish oil supplement use.
We were also able to assess self-reported intake of fatty acids and fish oil before diagnosis among the 64 incident cases of SLE identified on a follow-up questionnaire approximately 6 years into the study.34 Thus we were able to compare baseline energy-adjusted fatty acid intake and fatty acid ratios between incident cases and non-cases. All analyses were performed using R version 4.2.0 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria).This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Loma Linda University (IRB #48134).Written, signed, and dated informed consent forms were obtained from all study participants.Results Only 358 females reported having been diagnosed with SLE and of these, 220 had been treated for SLE within the last 12 months.The two case groups and non-cases were significantly different with respect to age, race, smoking, dietary patterns, fish oil intake status, and BMI (Table 1).Cases who were not treated were similar to the non-cases on most covariables.
The treated cases tended to be younger, of Black race, past smokers, follow a non-vegetarian diet and had higher BMI. Compared to Whites, Blacks were 50% more likely to be diagnosed and treated.Twice as many diagnosed and treated cases used fish oil compared to the non-treated cases and the non-cases, 23.6% vs 10.1% and 12.5%, respectively (p<0.0001).The median consumption for DHA+EPA and the ratios of omega-3/ omega-6 and (DHA+EPA)/omega-6 were all significantly higher in cases who were treated compared to both non-treated cases and non-cases (Table 2).In binary logistic regression analyses, the highest quartile of the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids showed significantly higher odds for SLE (OR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.98, p trend=0.01) compared to those in the lowest quartile in the basic model adjusting for age, race, education, and smoking (Table 3).When dietary pattern and BMI were added to the model, the relationship was strengthened slightly (OR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.05).
A similar, but less consistent, observation was seen for the ratio of DHA+EPA to omega-6 fatty acids with OR for treated cases of 1.51, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.28), (p trend=0.029) for the 4th quartile compared to the first quartile, but this was attenuated in the fully adjusted model (Table 4). Interestingly, the ratio of ALA to omega-6 fatty acids did not show any relationship with prevalent SLE.One thing to note is that in all logistic regressions, Black race and having Oh et al.Page 6 Lupus .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 16.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript ever smoked consistently showed a significant positive relationship with the outcomes.For the non-treated cases, these associations were much weaker (Tables 3–4).
When assessing the time of starting fish oil supplementations with the time of diagnosis among 52 cases taking fish oil, 12 of 13 (92.3%) of the non-treated cases and 33 of 39 (84.6%) of the treated cases had started fish oil supplementation around the time of diagnosis or in the first years after diagnosis. Among the 64 incident cases of SLE diagnosed at 6 year follow-up, there was no difference in baseline (pre-diagnosis) intake of omega-3 fatty acids or ratios of omega-3/omega-6 compared to the non-cases (data not shown).Discussion The prevalence of SLE in our study was somewhat lower than what has been reported by others3 and among those diagnosed, a smaller proportion were actively being treated (61%).
This could be related to the higher omega-3 intakes and other dietary practices of this population as we have previously reported.3 We assessed confounding and effect modification, but in multivariable analyses, no covariates were found to have significant associations with SLE status except race and smoking history. Our findings concur with other findings in the literature that suggest SLE is more commonly found in Non-Hispanic Black women.Lahita et al.18 reported that SLE was found to be three times more probable in persons of African and Asian descent compared to Caucasian descent.Furthermore, they found that SLE was nine times more likely in women of childbearing age, and three times more likely in prepubescent children.Our study found an association with previous smoking, but did not observe that age was related to SLE status and the prevalence of SLE was only 40–50% higher among Blacks compared to Whites.
Contrary to the literature, we found that the consumption of DHA+EPA fatty acids was significantly higher in women with SLE who were treated compared to non-treated cases as well as to the non-cases. When the ratios were calculated, treated cases reported significantly higher intakes of total omega-3 to omega-6 and DHA+EPA to omega 6 fatty acids compared to non-cases.In logistic regression analyses, those consuming higher ratios of omega-3 to omega-6 and DHA+EPA to omega-6 were more likely to have been diagnosed and treated for SLE compared to the group that consumed the lowest ratio of those fatty acids.Starting in the late 1980s, interventional studies with omega-3 fatty acids as treatments were conducted among patients diagnosed with SLE.
These studies showed promising results, especially for those with cardiovascular disease, which was considered a leading cause of death in individuals with SLE.39 Therefore, it is possible that the diagnosed cases of SLE in our study learned from the media that omega-3 fatty acids had been found to help alleviate the clinical manifestation of the disease through their anti-inflammatory effects and may provide cardioprotective and vascular effects.1Oh et al. Page 7 Lupus .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 16.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Because our study was mostly cross-sectional, with the exception of a small number of incident SLE cases (n=64) observed in the longitudinal portion of the AHS-2, we must conclude that our findings most likely are an example of reverse causation.The additional investigation of the timing of start of using fish-oil in relation to time of SLE diagnosis supports this interpretation.
The majority of prevalent SLE cases who reported using fish- oil supplements reported starting such supplements at or shortly after being diagnosed. Also, among the 64 incident cases, there was no difference in their reported baseline (e.g.pre-diagnosis) intake of fish-oil supplement or omega-3 fatty acids compared to non-cases.This further supports our theory of reverse causation among a relatively health informed group.Adventists, in general, are highly educated and health conscious individuals.They are typically very careful about their dietary practices and about half of them are vegetarians.Our study participants were recruited from 2002 to 2007.Since there was no cure for SLE, but only symptomatic treatment, SLE patients may very well have searched for non-drug treatments.This may be especially true since alternative prescription medicines such as long-term corticosteroids are known to have significant and sometimes serious side-effects.
Studies have found that an intake of 2 or more grams a day of DHA+EPA can reduce maximum inflammation in people with SLE.22, 47 Fish oil supplements have been used to study the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in clinical trials.48, 49 Fish oil concentrations were often reported rather than the active components, which are DHA and EPA. Duffy et al.(2004)49 conducted a randomized controlled trial of omega-3 fish oil (3g/day) supplementation for individuals with SLE and reported that those taking fish oil had a significant reduction in disease activity score.In another clinical trial in which participants either received fish oil supplementation or olive oil placebo, there was a statistically significant increase in physician global assessment scale in those taking fish oil.48 These studies suggest that people who increase the intake of omega-3 fats while decreasing the intake of omega-6 fats may end up needing less SLE treating medication because their inflammation decreases.
Validation of self-reported fish-oil supplementation has been conducted in clinical trials using gas chromatography to assess the omega-3 fatty acid levels in the red blood cells of the study subjects.22 The fatty acids are carried through the bloodstream in lipids within lipoproteins; those taking daily fish oil supplements show a significant incorporation of the DHA and EPA compounds in their platelet membranes.49 Greco et al.50 in their review of complementary and alternative medicine treatments reported that more than 50% of individuals with SLE have utilized treatments such as omega-3 fatty acids to reduce symptoms and disease activity. The limited number of effective pharmaceutical agents for treating symptoms of SLE and reducing risk for SLE-related co-morbidities make consumption of omega-3 fatty acids for SLE compelling.Therefore, most likely, our study participants with SLE began incorporating omega-3 fatty acids into their diet, including supplements, after diagnosis.
Strengths and Limitations One of the main strengths of this study is that the study population has a wide range of dietary practices. This provides us reasonable power to investigate an association between Oh et al.Page 8 Lupus .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 16.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript this rather uncommon disorder and intake of various fatty acids and their ratios.Further, our food-frequency questionnaire has good validity to assess fat intake.Another strength is that our study participants were recruited from all 50 states in the United States and Canada.Further, our study includes a large proportion of Black women who have the highest risk of SLE, allowing us to adjust by race.Study limitations include the validity of a self-reported SLE diagnosis, but one would not expect many false positive because the assessment included not only doctor-told diagnosis but also current treatment for SLE.
However, since the study was cross-sectional, causality cannot be established. Nor can we assess the association between nutrition and SLE in a prospective way due to low incidence of SLE in the general population.Conclusions We have assessed the association between omega-3, omega-6, and various ratios of fatty acid consumption and the three analytic groups of SLE.As with other cross-sectional studies, Black race and smoking history were higher among those reporting a diagnosis of SLE.However, our findings that the study subjects who have been diagnosed with SLE and are being treated have higher intakes of omega-3 fatty acids as well as higher ratios of omega-3 to omega-6 and DHA+EPA to omega-6 fatty acids, were surprising.The more favorable intakes among the SLE subjects seems to have been adopted around the time of diagnosis suggesting reverse causation and a positive effect of public health information in this health conscious population.
