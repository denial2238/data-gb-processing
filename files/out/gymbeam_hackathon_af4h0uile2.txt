However, few studies have identified the prevalence and risk factors associated with vitamin D insufficiency within elite Para-Athletes.Methods An electronic search was completed on the 5th January 2023 and updated on the 21st June 2024, searching Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and EASY (originally OpenGrey).
To meet the eligibility criteria, retrieved studies were required to include at least one baseline measure of a vitamin D biomarker from elite Para-Athletes performing at national or international levels and therefore all quantitative study designs could be included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist (8-item) for analytical cross-sectional studies.Data from the eligible studies was extracted and charted, with a supporting narrative synthesis.Results The search strategy retrieved 3083 articles, of which ten studies met the inclusion criteria.In total there were n = 355 Para-Athletes, 69.6% of which comprised of males in the included studies.Across the ten included studies, n = 546 samples were taken from n = 355 Para-Athletes across different seasons and based upon the 25(OH)D insufficiency and deficiency thresholds set by each individual study 43.2% of the samples were considered insufficient and 28.1% deficient.
During the winter months vitamin D insufficiency was at its most prevalent at 74.1%, compared to 57.1% in summer of the 25(OH)D samples measured in Para-Athletes. Wheelchair athletes who competed in indoor sports were also more susceptible to low vitamin D.Conclusion This review has highlighted that vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency is highly prevalent in elite level Para-Athletes, all year, across both summer and winter months.Therefore, this review highlights the need for education, treatment, and preventative measures in elite Para-Athletes throughout the year.Registration The following systematic review was prospectively registered through PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO registration ID number: CRD42022362149).The Prevalence of Low Vitamin D in Elite Para- Athletes: A Systematic Review Christina Kate Langley1,2,3, Christopher Ian Morse1,2 and Aidan John Buffey4,5* Page 2 of 19 Langley et al.
Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:96 Background Background and Rationale The role of vitamin D upon human physiological func - tion has been thoroughly researched in recent decades whereby the identification of high levels of deficiency1 worldwide continues to drive research in this area [ 1, 2]. Despite having two major sources of vitamin D through diet and endogenous cutaneous synthesis of ultraviolet beta (UVb) radiation from sun exposure [ 3] vitamin D deficiency is typically more common than other micronu - trient deficiencies.Largely due to dietary vitamin D only accounting for 10–20% of circulating vitamin D as well as numerous risk factors that inhibit vitamin D absorption and metabolism [ 1, 4].Risk factors that impact absorp - tion include but are not limited to: sun protection such as clothing and sun cream, outdoor time, skin pigmentation [3] and latitude.
Individuals living at latitudes over 35⁰N experience seasonal variations and have severely reduced to negligible amounts of UVb exposure in the winter and autumn months [ 5]. Likewise, factors such as anti-con - vulsant medications and kidney diseases can reduce the metabolism of vitamin D [ 6].There are also other known modifiable lifestyle factors which impact UVb exposure, for example, sedentary behaviours have been shown to correlate to reductions in outdoor time and sun exposure is likely to be diminished [ 7].These risk factors are all likely contributors to the world-wide problem of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiencies [ 2].
Vitamin D deficiency ( < 50 nmol ˑl− 1 and insufficiency (50–75 nmol ˑl− 1)) (hereby known as ‘low vitamin D’) is known to reduce regulation of intestinal calcium absorption which is a major determinant of calcium 1 Please note - Vitamin D deficiency is defined by most experts and The Endocrine Society as a total 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 50 nmol ˑl−1 (< 20 ngˑml−1). Vitamin D insufficiency is defined as a level of between 50 and 75 nmol ˑl− 1 (20–30 ng ˑml− 1), and > 75 nmol ˑl− 1 (> 30 ng ˑml− 1) or greater indi - cates sufficient levels.Moreso, an ‘optimal’ threshold is described by most as > 100 nmol ˑl− 1 (>40 ng ˑml− 1).These will be the thresholds used by the authors in this review.However due to the nature of this review some pub - lished literature identified may use different thresholds to define deficiency which will be identified throughout.homeostasis [ 8].
As vitamin D plays a central role in calcium absorption, individuals with low vitamin D are most commonly associated with diminished bone health [9]. To address the deterioration of bone health, an abun - dance of research has focused on ageing populations who are susceptible to low bone density and supplementing vitamin D as an intervention to reduce fractures and osteoporosis risk [ 10–13].There is however growing evidence around the impact of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency upon other non-skeletal systems such as, reductions in immune function [ 14] and skeletal muscle strength and function [ 15–17].A systematic review and meta-analysis identified six randomised control trials that assessed the impact of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength in young adults compared to con - trols and identified significant increases in upper and lower limb strength after supplementation [ 18].
With this growing acknowledgement that vitamin D deficiency does indeed impact muscle strength and bone health, research into vitamin D has shifted over to athletic popu - lations to identify the impact of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency on decrements in performance, recovery rate as well as its impact on injuries and illness in ath - letes [ 19–21]. Early research, informed by the detrimen - tal effects of low vitamin D, investigated the effect of supplementation beyond sufficient to an ‘optimal’ level to identify if vitamin D could indeed improve performance, in athletes [ 20].However, the benefits of shifting vitamin D levels from ‘sufficient’ to ‘optimal’ were negligible [ 20], whereas previous research has shown that musculoskel - etal performance only improves in individuals who had low vitamin D as a baseline [ 22].
These findings justify the recommendation and need for athletes to have suffi - cient levels of vitamin D, to mitigate reductions in normal physiological function [ 22]. However, numerous studies have identified that the high prevalence of low vitamin D that is reported across general non-athletic populations is just as prominent in athletic populations and is therefore accompanied by decrements in musculoskeletal health and performance [ 19, 23–26].The prevalence of low vita - min D has been shown to differ when comparing the type Key points 74.1% of all 25(OH)D samples taken from elite Para-Athletes were considered insufficient in the winter months, therefore showing a high prevalence rate of low vitamin D.There is a high prevalence of low vitamin D all year round where 68.1% of samples taken from time points across the year were considered insufficient in elite Para-Athletes.
Based upon group averages indoor elite Para-Athletes from all included studies had low vitamin D all year round. Dietary vitamin D intake was very poor in all elite Para-Athletes.Elite Wheelchair Para-Athletes are more likely to be vitamin D deficient based upon group averages compared to elite ambulatory Para-Athletes.Keywords 25(OH)D, Ambulatory, Deficiency, Dietary intake, Disability, Insufficiency, Season, Sport, Wheelchair Page 3 of 19 Langley et al.Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:96 of sport played, for example, Constatini et al.[ 27] showed indoor athletes to be at an elevated risk of vitamin D insufficiency compared with outdoor athletes, with 80% compared to 48% being insufficient, respectively.
The risk of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in athletes has been shown at varying latitudes and unsurprisingly a study based in the United Kingdom (UK) (53⁰N) showed insufficient levels of vitamin D < 75 nmol ˑl− 1 in all ath - letes assessed from rugby players, footballers, flat and jump jockeys during the winter [ 28]. Although the risks of insufficiency are higher in less equatorial populations, athletes living in countries close to the equator where vitamin D would typically be assumed to be sufficient, have also been shown to be at risk as illustrated in an Australian study (35⁰S) by Lovell [ 29] who found insuf - ficiency in 83% of their female gymnasts.The importance of vitamin D sufficiency ( > 75 nmol ˑl− 1) in athletic per - formance is highlighted by numerous literature reviews that show improvements in lower limb muscle strength and athletic performance when insufficient athletes increase their circulating 25(OH)D levels to sufficient levels [ 30–32].
With the known benefits that sufficient levels of vitamin D have on musculoskeletal performance, injury reduction and general health in both athletic and clinical populations [ 30, 33], it is surprising that there is a dearth of literature on the prevalence and treatment of low vitamin D in athletes with disabilities (hereby known as Para-Athletes). Para-Athletes may encompass problems that both ath - letic and clinical populations experience due to low vita - min D.A major issue that many Para-Athletes face is a predisposition to reduced musculoskeletal health and higher risk of injury compared to that of typically devel - oped athletes [ 34].Site-specific reductions in muscle and bone health are often due to secondary implications caused by decreased musculoskeletal loading resulting from reduced levels of ambulation and range of move - ment in individuals with physical disabilities such as cerebral palsy (CP), spina bifida and SCI [ 35–37].
Despite Para-Athletes typically showing higher levels of physi - cal activity than sedentary non-athletes with disability [38], Para-Athletes with neurological and musculoskel - etal impairments may experience lower muscle strength and bone health compared to typically developed, age matched controls, such as ambulatory athletes with CP . For example, Langley et al.[ 34] found that Para-Athletes with CP had a 23.7% smaller vastus lateralis CSA, a 40.5% smaller knee extensor strength and a radius T score that was − 1.75 standard deviations (SDs) less compared to typically developed controls [ 34].These loses in bone health are even more prominent in wheelchair (WC) based Para-Athletes where osteopenia and osteoporosis have been identified in 45.8% and 12.5% of WC based athletes with SCI [ 39].
The musculoskeletal health of Para-Athletes may be exacerbated by low vitamin D due to numerous risk factors that reduce vitamin D absorp - tion and metabolism such as sedentary behaviour and medications. Therefore, it is important to identify the prevalence of low vitamin D in Para-Athletes and the associated risk factors (both non-modifiable and modi - fiable) to help inform future research.Furthermore, the findings may help to inform future interventions that aim to improve the musculoskeletal health, performance and injury risk in Para-Athletes.Aims This present systematic review aimed to (1) identify the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in national to elite level Para-Athletes, and (2) identify risk factors which account towards vitamin D insufficiency in elite Para-Athletes.Research Questions (1) What is the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in national to elite Para-Athletes worldwide?
(2) What are the risk factors which is associated with vitamin D insuf - ficiency in elite Para-Athletes? Methods Data Sources and Search Strategy This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines (please see Supplementary File 1 for completed PRISMA Checklist) [ 40].A protocol for this review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (registration ID number: CRD42022362149) prior to data extraction.The PECO framework was used a priori to inform the development of the search strategy: (P) Population: Elite level Para-Athletes playing at a national level or above.(E) Exposures: Latitude, season, diet, ethnicity, age, descriptive characteristics, physical activity level, outdoor exposures, direct sun exposures, sun protection used, ambulation levels, season, impair - ment type, type of sport and vitamin D assay used.
(C) Comparison: We did not wish to compare interventions or treatments (this is typical in some PECO analysis frameworks, where a comparison is not always present). (O) Outcome: Serum total 25(OH)D levels and preva - lence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency.Two independent investigators (C.K.L.and A.J.B.) con - ducted the systematic literature search, retrieving articles published prior to the 5th January 2023 to the earliest published record and updated searches were completed on the 25th September 2023 and on the 21st June 2024.The electronic search was completed across five data - bases: Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and EASY (originally OpenGrey) using a search strategy that was developed in conjunction with a University Librarian (See Supplementary File 2 for full Page 4 of 19 Langley et al.Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:96 search strings used for each database, including MEsH terms).
The reference lists of the included studies were manually searched. Eligibility Criteria and Paper Selection Inclusion criteria were: (1) English language publica - tion; (2) participants aged ≥ 16 years; (3) participants were Para-Athletes playing at national level or above; (4) assessed for ≥ one biomarker of vitamin D at un-supple - mented levels.Studies were excluded if: (1) participants were impacted by diseases which impact the metabo - lism and/or synthesis of vitamin D; (2) participants were supplemented prior to study commencement, without providing baseline measures.These criteria allowed for direct evaluation between impairment type, ambulation levels, type of sport (indoor or outdoor), latitude and diet.Retrieved articles were reviewed by two reviewers independently (C.K.L.and A.J.B.); the retrieved studies were screened firstly, by title and abstract based upon the inclusion criteria, and then the full text to confirm eligi - bility.
Any disparity regarding eligibility was discussed between the two independent reviewers until a consen - sus was reached (Fig. 1).Quality Assessment The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist (8-item) for analytical cross-sectional studies was used to assess the risk of bias (quality) of the included studies within this observational systematic review.This quality assessment was completed by separate and blinded independent reviewers (C.K.L.and A.J.B.) who were blinded to each-other.Any disagreements between reviewers were discussed until a consensus was made.The questions (see below) were scored quantitatively out of 8.Questions included: (1) Were the criteria for inclusion in the sample clearly defined?(2) Were the study subjects and the setting described in detail?(3) Was the exposure measured in a valid and reliable way?(4) Were objective, standard criteria used for measurement of the condition?(5) Were confounding factors identified?
(6) Were strate - gies to deal with confounding factors stated? (7) Were the outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way?(8) Was appropriate statistical analysis used?Definition of Low Vitamin D In this review the definitions of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were combined and referred to as ‘low vita - min D’ .All studies reported 25(OH)D the major circulat - ing metabolite of vitamin D, but the 25(OH)D measures were either reported as nmol ˑl− 1 or ng ˑml−1.For this systematic review, we converted and reported all 25(OH)D measures in nmol ˑl− 1 by multiplying 25(OH)D in ngˑml− 1 by 2.496 (1 ng ˑml− 1 = 2.496 nmol ˑl−1).Data Extraction and Synthesis Microsoft Excel sheets (Microsoft Excel, Version 2212) were developed and confirmed by the research team and used for the extraction of data.
Outcomes extracted in the review were, study characteristics, participant char - acteristics, impairment type, sport played, vitamin D outcome measures including dietary vitamin D intake, vitamin D metabolite measured, vitamin D levels, lati - tude and the season that vitamin D was collected in, from each article which was manually extracted by the first author (C.K.L.) from the included studies. Due to the heterogeneity in study design of the included stud - ies, undertaking a meta-analysis was deemed not to be appropriate.The analysis of the eligible retrieved stud - ies is presented via a narrative synthesis, reporting, and critically appraising the study design, target populations, setting, and outcomes of interest that relate to vitamin D.The descriptive information and variables reported from the included studies were extracted and included within this systematic review (See Tables 1 and 2).
Results Literature Search Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias The quality assessment scores of each article are reported in Table 1. The quality of seven of the ten included stud - ies was mutually agreed upon, with three of the studies included requiring discussion until a consensus was met.Study Characteristics and Descriptors Table 1 provides details of the study characteristics of the ten included articles.Of the ten included studies, three of the studies were completed in Switzerland, two in the United Kingdom (UK), two across the USA and Canada, one in Ireland, one in Norway and one in Lithuania.All studies included were performed at latitudes above the equator between 37–62°N and therefore experienced seasonal variations.
Two studies described one season of 25(OH)D in Para-Athletes, five studies collected repeated measures of 25(OH)D throughout the year, three stud - ies collected pre and post vitamin D supplementation whereby for the purpose of this review only baseline pre- supplemented measures were extracted [ 41] (Table 1). Participant Characteristics In total, 355 participants were sampled in the ten included studies.All ten of the included studies used elite Para-Athletes performing at national or interna - tional level (see Table 2 which illustrates impairment types and sports played).Nine of the included studies Page 5 of 19 Langley et al.Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:96 included male participants (total n = 247, 69.6%), whereas seven studies included female participants (total n = 108, 30.4%).Age was collected in all ten studies.Standing stat - ure was measured in seven of ten studies.One study col - lected seated stature of their sampled WC Para-Athletes [42].
Eight of the ten studies collected body mass. Two studies did not report stature or mass of their partici - pants [ 43, 44].Dietary Vitamin D Five of the ten studies reported dietary vitamin D, of which all five measured dietary intakes in the winter months [ 34, 42, 43, 45, 46] and just one of those five Fig.1 The PRISMA flow diagram illustrating the number of studies retrieved and how many were assessed for eligibility before being excluded with reasons, leaving the final n = 10 of included studies, following the PRISMA 2020 statement: an updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews [ 40] Page 6 of 19 Langley et al.Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:96 reported dietary vitamin D in the autumn [ 46].All of the five studies, which reported dietary intake, were well below the Institute of Medicines (IOM) recommended daily intake (RDI) of 400–600 international units (IU) [47, 48].Baranauskas et al.[ 45] reported an average vitamin D intake of 244 ± 228 IU/d (61% of RDI).
Lang - ley et al. [ 34] found that the average dietary vitamin D intake was 166 ± 186 IU/d (41.5% of RDI).Pritchett et al.[46] reported Para-Athletes to have a dietary intake of 115 ± 12.25 IU/d in the winter (29.75% of RDI).Para- Athletes in Pritchett et al.[ 42] averaged 212 ± 103 IU/d (53% of RDI).Magee et al.[ 43] reported a daily vitamin D intake of 5.49 µg/d (219 IU/d) (54.75% of RDI).Pritch - ett et al.[ 46] was the only study that reported autumn dietary vitamin D in Para-Athletes which was well below the RDI at 121.1 ± 9.8 IU/d (30.25% of RDI).No dietary vitamin D was reported in the summer or spring months.Three of the five studies analysed the relationship between dietary vitamin D and 25(OH)D and all reported no association of dietary vitamin D with 25(OH)D in Para-Athletes [ 34, 43, 46].Measurement of Vitamin D All ten of the included studies measured the vitamin D metabolite 25(OH)D, measured via different techniques.
Seven studies collected venous blood samples of those seven, three of the included studies performed enzyme linked Immuno-Sorbent Assays [ 34, 43, 49], two stud - ies performed enzyme linked florescent assays [ 41, 50], one study used electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) [ 51] and one study analysed their samples using a haematological analyser [ 45].

Vitamin D Status Thresholds Eight of the ten studies used the threshold for vitamin D sufficiency as > 75 nmol ˑl− 1 (or 30 ng ˑml− 1), with their insufficiency thresholds being between 75 − 50 nmol ˑl− 1 (30 − 20 ng ˑml− 1) and the deficiency thresholds being set at < 50 nmol ˑl− 1 (< 20 ng ˑml− 1) (Table 3). The study by Pritchett et al.[ 46] used a sufficiency threshold of < 80 nmol ˑl− 1 (< 32 ng ˑml− 1), with their insufficiency thresh - olds being between 80 − 50 nmolּˑl− 1 (32 − 20 ng ˑml−1) and the deficiency thresholds being the same as the six studies above set at < 50 nmol ˑl− 1 (< 20 ng ˑml− 1).The study by Magee et al.[44] used a lower sufficiency thresh - old of > 50 nmol ˑl− 1 (> 20 ng ˑml− 1) and used a threshold of < 50 nmol ˑl− 1 (< 20 ng ˑml− 1) for insufficiency but did not state one for deficiency (See Table 3).
Four of the ten studies also included severely deficient thresholds, where two studies set a threshold at < 27.5 nmol ˑl− 1 (< 13 ngˑml− 1) [42, 51] and two at < 25 nmol ˑl− 1 (< 12 ng ˑml− 1) [35, 50] (Table 3). Seasons Measured and Low 25(OH)D Prevalence In total the ten included studies collected a total of n = 546 25(OH)D samples from the n = 355 participants in all studies combined (Table 3).Of the ten studies included, one study collected multiple 25(OH)D samples over a 12-month period overall totalling n = 154 samples from n = 72 participants.Eight studies reported 25(OH) D in the winter months which included n = 274 samples from a total of n = 250 participants.One study collected 25(OH)D n = 39 samples in the spring from n = 39 par - ticipants [ 44].Four studies collected a total of n = 112 25(OH)D samples in the summer months in a total of n = 107 participants [ 44, 45, 49, 50].Two studies collected n = 65 25(OH)D samples in the autumn from n = 65 par - ticipants [ 42, 44].
One study collected 25(OH)D samples between March and October, but 25(OH)D samples were separated into 4 different time points over a 12-week period based upon the Para-Athletes training schedule (T0-baseline, T1-4 weeks, T2-8 weeks, T3–12 weeks) meaning that seasonal means were not identifiable [ 51].

Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:96 reported average levels that were insufficient [ 42, 43, 46, 50], and four studies reported levels that were con - sidered deficient [ 34, 41, 44, 49]. In the summer months 25(OH)D was reported in Para-Athletes by four stud - ies, where two studies reported an average 25(OH)D that was insufficient [ 45, 50] and two studies showed 25(OH)D to be sufficient in the summer months [ 44, 49].Two studies measured 25(OH)D in Para-Athletes in the autumn which were both on average insufficient [44, 46].One study that took mean 25(OH)D between March and October reported insufficient levels of 25(OH)D [ 51].One study presented mean 25(OH)D in the spring months which was considered insufficient [ 44] (See Fig.2A).Two studies investigated seasonal varia - tions, whereby Langley et al.[ 49] found a 70.5% increase p = 0.003 from winter (deficient on average) to summer months (insufficient on average).Whereas Pritchett et al.
[46] found that there were no significant differences between autumn or winter months in their Para-Athletes. Sex and Vitamin D Six studies collected 25(OH)D samples from both male and female Para-Athletes [ 42–44, 46, 50, 51], four of which did not separate male and female samples, there - fore these four studies were not able to be compared by sex [ 42–44, 51].One study collected from females only [45] and three collected from males only [ 34, 42, 49].Of the three studies that measured female Para-Athletes, two studies collected 25(OH)D over two seasons, winter and summer [ 50] and winter and autumn [ 46] and one study collected 25(OH)D during the summer only [ 45].All included studies that solely measured or separated female Para-Athletes, illustrated that they were insuf - ficient in 25(OH)D despite measuring in different sea - sons [ 43, 45, 46].
Of the six studies that measured male Para-Athletes, three studies collected 25(OH)D over two seasons, winter and summer [ 49, 50] and winter and autumn [ 46] and two studies collected from males only in the winter months [ 34, 41]. Of those five studies that measured males in the winter months four showed defi - ciency, [ 34, 41, 49, 50] and one showed insufficiency [ 46].Whereas, when investigating the studies that measured within the summer period, one study showed male Para- Athletes were insufficient [ 50] and one study found male Para-Athletes to be sufficient in the summer [ 49].In the one study that measured 25(OH)D in the autumn, male Para-Athletes were classified as insufficient on average [46].Two of the included studies compared differences between sex and 25(OH)D within their own study [ 46, 50].Whereby Flueck et al.[ 50] showed no significant dif - ference between sex across the whole year and Pritchett et al.
[ 46] concluded that 25(OH)D was not significantly different between sex in the autumn ( p = 0.29) or winter (p = 0.59).Article Insufficiency Thresh - olds Used in ArticleSeason(s) / Time Point(s) 25(OH)D MeasuredSamples Insuf - ficient or BelowSamples SufficientSamples InsufficientSamples DeficientSamples Severely DeficientSerum 25(OH)D Levels (Total Samples) Autumn n = 21 (81%)n = 5 (19%)n = 11 (43%)n = 10 (38%)- 60.0 ± 21.0 nmol ˑl− 1 24.1 ± 8.4 ng ˑml− 1 32–123 nmol ˑl− 1 13–49 ng ˑml− 1 Totals n = 372 (68.1%)n = 174 (31.9%)n = 236 (43.2%)n = 119 (21.8%)n = 17 (3.1%)62.6 ± 22.9 nmol ˑl− 1 25.2 ± 9.2 ng ˑml− 1 Winter n = 203 (74.1%)n = 71 (25.9%)n = 112 (40.9%)n = 75 (27.4%)n = 16 (5.8%)53 ± 20.2 nmol ˑl− 1 21.3 ± 8.1 ng ˑml− 1 Spring n = 25 (64.1%)n = 14 (35.9%)n = 14 (35.9%)n = 11 (28.2%)- 69.0 ± 37.0 nmol ˑl− 1 27.7 ± 14.9 ng ˑml− 1 Summer n = 64 (57.1%)n = 48 (42.9%)n = 46 (41.1%)n = 17 (15.2%)n = 1 (1%)31.9 ± 19.3 nmol ˑl− 1 18.3 ± 8.6 ng ˑml− 1 Autumn n = 47 (72.3%)n = 18 (27.7%)n = 31 (47.7%)n = 16 (24.6%)- 31.3 ± 18.5 nmol ˑl− 1 18.0 ± 7.9 ng ˑml− 1 Not Specified n = 33 (58.9%)n = 23 (41.1%)n = 33 (58.9%)- - 32.2 ± 17.6 nmol ˑl− 1 17.9 ± 6.8 ng ˑml− 1 Abbreviations 25(OH)D − 25-Hydroxyvitamin DTable 3 (continued) Page 12 of 19 Langley et al.
Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:96 Training Environment on 25(OH)D Two of the included studies measured 25(OH)D and reported separately indoor and outdoor training Para- Athletes within the published manuscript [ 46, 50]. Whereas two of the included studies sampled and reported outdoor Para-Athletes only [ 34, 49] and two of the included studies included and reported on 25(OH) D for indoor Para-Athletes only [ 41, 45] (Table 4).Four studies did not report the training environments of their Para-Athletes [ 42–44, 51].When examining vitamin D status, in the context of training environment, of the Para-Athletes, one study reported sufficient vitamin D in outdoor Para-Athletes in the summer months [ 49] where a second study found outdoor Para-Athletes in the summer months to be insufficient (50–75 nmol ˑl− 1) [41].
Two studies reported insufficient 25(OH)D levels in indoor Para-Athletes in the summer months [ 45, 50] and one study reported indoor athletes to be deficient in 25(OH)D ( < 50 nmol ˑl− 1) [50]. Of the studies where sampling took place during the win - ter months, two studies reported insufficient 25(OH) D levels (50–75 nmol ˑl− 1) in outdoor Para-Athletes [46, 50] and two studies reported deficiency in outdoor Para-Athletes [ 34, 49].Indoor Para-Athletes, in the win - ter, were reported to be insufficient (50–75 nmol ˑl− 1) by one study [ 46] and a further study reported indoor Para- Athletes to be deficient ( < 50 nmol ˑl− 1) [50].Pritchett et al.[ 46] reported vitamin D status in autumn in both indoor and outdoor Para-Athletes, of which both indoor and outdoor athletes were insufficient on average (See Fig.2B).Two of the included studies investigated the dif - ference between indoor and outdoor Para-Athletes [ 46, 50].Flueck et al.
[ 50] reported that outdoor Para-Athletes had significantly higher ( p < 0.05) 25(OH)D levels com - pared to indoor Para-Athletes in summer, winter, and the combined seasonal averages for a whole year. Whereas Pritchett et al.[ 46] reported no significant difference in 25(OH)D among indoor and outdoor Para-Athletes in the autumn ( p = 0.19) or winter months ( p = 0.75).Ambulation Levels Nine of the ten studies distinguished the status of ambu - lation of their sampled participants i.e., ambulatory or WC based Para-Athletes.Five out of the nine studies measured WC Para-Athletes only ( n = 181), three studies measured ambulatory Para-Athletes only ( n = 54) and one measured both ambulatory and WC based Para-Athletes (WC n = 12 and ambulatory n = 21).Totalling n = 193 WC Para-Athletes and n = 75 ambulatory Para-Athletes (see Table 2 for information on specific impairment types).Steffen et al.[ 44] did not identify the ambulation lev - els of their Para-Athletes.
In the summer months, one study reported sufficient 25(OH)D levels [ 49] and one study reported insufficient levels of 25(OH)D in ambu - latory Para-Athletes [ 45]. The one study including WC Para-Athletes that measured 25(OH)D in the summer, reported insufficiency [ 50].Autumn values were only sampled by one study and highlighted 25(OH)D insuffi - ciency in WC Para-Athletes [ 46].During the winter one study reported 25(OH)D levels to be insufficient [ 43] and two studies reported 25(OH)D levels to be deficient in ambulatory Para-Athletes [ 34, 49].Whereas five studies measured 25(OH)D in the winter with WC Para-Ath - letes, in which three studies reported insufficiency [ 42, 46, 50] and two studies reported deficiency [ 41, 43].One study reported insufficiency in their WC Para-Athletes but did not distinguish between the seasons/months measured (March-October) and therefore it cannot be delineated as to the seasonality of this measurement [ 51].Fig.2 A & B.

The legends identify the descriptives being compared.Solid lines denote threshold for vitamin D insufficiency (< 75 − 50 nmol ˑl− 1) and dashed lines denote threshold for vitamin D deficiency (< 50 nmol ˑl− 1).Two studies were not included in these figures due to them providing a latitude range between 37–56°N and therefore could not be plotted [ 42, 46].One study was not included due to 25(OH)D being averaged from samples taken across different seasons making it unidentifiable [ 51] Page 13 of 19 Langley et al.Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:96 25(OH)D across Sexes 25(OH)D across Sports Environments Serum 25(OH)D based on Ambu - lation Level Article Season Male Female Indoor Athletes Outdoor AthleteWheelchair Ambulatory Magee et al.

3).Discussion To the authors’ knowledge this systematic review, is the first review to examine previous studies which have mea - sured and reported un-supplemented vitamin D levels in elite Para-Athletes with the aim to identify the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency (low vitamin D) in these elite Para-Athletes and the potential risk fac - tors that may account towards reductions in vitamin D.

Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:96 This systematic review identified n = 355 Para-Athletes from the ten included studies who provide n = 548 sam - ples, based upon the 25(OH)D insufficiency and defi - ciency thresholds set by each individual study n = 372 (68.1%) samples taken across different time points in the year from the Para-Athletes were insufficient. Overall, this systematic review presents a new body of evidence that demonstrates that elite Para-Athletes living at lati - tudes > 37oN are at high risk of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency throughout the year.When interpreting the findings of this review and thus the findings of the included studies, it is important to note that eight of the ten studies used the threshold for vitamin D sufficiency as > 75 nmol ˑl− 1 (or 30 ng ˑml− 1) which was set by The Endocrine Society [ 2].However, Magee et al.
[ 43] used a lower threshold for insufficiency of < 50 nmol ˑl− 1 compared to the other included studies which may explain their higher levels of vitamin D suffi - ciency. The median value for the Para-Athletes in Magee et al.[ 43] was 57.9 nmol ˑl− 1 which using the more com - mon thresholds of > 75 nmol ˑl− 1 for sufficiency would likely increase the prevalence of insufficiency in their sampled Para-Athletes.Using a lower threshold may reduce the urgency for treatment such as supplemen - tation of vitamin D, which may lead to implications on performance, reductions in muscle function [ 52] and increase risk of fracture [ 53].Initially, Pritchett et al.[ 46] set a sufficiency threshold of > 80 nmol ˑl− 1 in their study published in 2016, however in the follow up article pub - lished in 2017 [ 42] they chose to set the threshold at > 75 nmol ˑl− 1 in line with the majority of the included studies to align with the thresholds set by The Endocrine Society [2].
The ability to directly interpret vitamin D status was limited, due to various factors including the differences in thresholds for insufficiency and sufficiency set by the included studies. Furthermore, one of the included stud - ies misreported their 25(OH)D units as mmol ˑl− 1 when the values aligned with ng ˑml− 1 [41].To ensure interpre - tation was done correctly the first author was contacted and it was confirmed that the units had been misreported as mmol ˑl− 1 rather than the intended units of ng ˑml− 1.This however did not impact the interpretation and reporting of the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in their study and therefore interpretation is correct in this systematic review [ 45].
Another factor that may have impacted the interpretation and comparison of 25(OH)D prevalence was the use of different methods of 25(OH)D analysis across the majority of included stud - ies, of which none used the gold standard liquid chroma - tography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) [54]. Therefore, the accuracy of the reported 25(OH)D values may have been compromised due to use of tech - niques such as ELISA and ECLIA that have been shown to typically over and underestimate 25(OH)D levels due to cross-reactivity [ 54, 55].This current review found that the low vitamin D risk is higher in elite Para-Athletes when compared to pre - vious findings of vitamin D status in athletes without impairment.For example, Harju et al.[ 56] reported an average 25(OH)D of 66.4 ± 30.4 nmol ˑl− 1 among n = 3725 elite athletes compared to 62.6 ± 22.9 nmol ˑl− 1 in the elite Para-Athletes sampled within this review.
However, due to the insufficiency cut-off being set at < 50 nmol ˑl− 1 in the Harju et al. [ 56] review compared to the threshold of < 75 nmol ˑl− 1 used in this current review any prevalence data cannot be directly compared.The inconsistent use of 25(OH)D threshold cut-offs creates a challenge for the comparison of 25(OH)D results.For example, when comparing a similar systematic review that sampled ath - letes, Farrokhyar et al.[ 57] identified a low vitamin D prevalence of 56% compared to this review of 68.1% in elite Para-Athletes.However, Farrokhyar et al.[ 57] used a higher vitamin D insufficiency threshold cut-off of < 80 nmol ˑl− 1 compared to < 75 nmol ˑl− 1 which may highlight a decreased prevalence of low vitamin D in athletes com - pared to if they had used the lower threshold and con - sequently, differences in low vitamin D prevalence might be even greater in elite Para-Athletes compared to other athletic populations if a consistent threshold cut-offs had been used.
Dietary vitamin D intake was found to be low in all included studies that measured and reported this out - come variable [ 34, 42, 43, 45, 46] when compared to the IOM’s recommendations of 400-600IU/d. Within the studies that measured dietary vitamin D they all reported that there was no relationship between dietary vitamin D and 25(OH)D levels.Low dietary vitamin D intake is not restricted to elite Para-Athletes but common and com - parable to healthy adult populations [ 48] and athletes [58].Spiro and Buttriss [ 48] found that healthy male and female adults living in ten different European countries (latitudes ranging between 38–59°N) had poor dietary intake below the RDI (range 1.6–7.1 µg/d (64–284 IU/d)) except for adults living in Norway who had a dietary intake of between 10.1 and 10.9 µg/day (404–436 IU/d) thus meeting the RDI.
Similarly, García and Guisado [58] found that a group of 21 elite male basketballers living in Barcelona (41°N) had an average vitamin D intake of 139 ± 79 (range 16–282) IU/d [ 58]. García and Guisado [ 58] also reported serum 25(OH)D levels posi - tively correlated with dietary intake of vitamin D ( r = 0.65; p < 0.001).Whereas in the studies involving Para-Ath - letes in the present review, no association was reported between 25(OH)D and dietary vitamin D.It is possible that a lack of association between dietary intake and 25(OH)D in Para-Athletes in the current studies is attrib - utable to all studies reporting deficient dietary intakes, Page 16 of 19 Langley et al.Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:96 with very high prevalence of 25(OH)D insufficiency; and as a result, there was a lack of outcome variability from which an association could be found [ 59].
Therefore, it is of importance that Para-Athletes should understand major dietary vitamin D sources and regularly track their dietary vitamin D intakes with the aim to meet the RDI’s to help achieve sufficient 25(OH)D levels. When considering the influence of sex on vitamin D status, there were no significant differences reported by any of the included studies that compared vitamin D sta - tus between male and female elite Para-Athletes.This finding aligns with a previous systematic review and meta-analysis of eight studies that investigated sex dif - ferences in healthy elite male and female athletes, which concluded that after within-study comparisons that there was no significant sex difference (RR = 1.0; 95% CI 0.79– 1.26) [ 56].
However, due to the heterogeneous sample within this review, confounded by the few studies, small sample sizes, low female Para-Athlete representation (n = 108/355 or 30.4%), diverse sports and varying impair - ment types, it is therefore unlikely that the 25(OH)D levels presented are a true reflection of the level of insuf - ficiency and deficiency of female Para-Athletes. It should be noted that the current knowledge of sex differences between healthy male and female populations (adults, children, etc.) is still unanswered, where there is currently no known research that identifies exact mechanisms that are able to categorically explain sex differences on vita - min D status and therefore cannot be truly answered in athletic populations [ 60].
The latitudes of all included studies in this review were > 37°N, whereby it was expected and shown that the prevalence of deficiency and insufficiency was greater in the winter months compared to the autumn and sum - mer, due to seasonal variations making UVb exposure extremely low or even negligible during the winter, at this latitude and above [ 61]. This seasonal variation in vitamin D found within this review is consistent with previous research published in athletes, were for example Morton et al.[ 62] showed seasonal decreases of serum 25(OH)D from optimal levels in the summer (104.4 ± 21.1 nmol ˑl− 1) to insufficient in the winter (51.0 ± 19.0 nmol ˑl− 1) in 20 professional footballers living in the UK at 53°N.How - ever, unlike athletes, the included studies and thus elite Para-Athletes sampled within this review demonstrated that the prevalence of insufficiency remained high in the summer months apart from one group of ambulatory Para-Athletes [ 49].
The one study which reported suf - ficient 25(OH)D in the summer months, sampled out - door Para-Athletes residing at 53°N, which was one of the highest latitudes included in this review [ 49]. Despite these Para-Athletes having less available sun exposure during the summer at 53°N compared to the studies with Para-Athletes residing at lower latitudes included in this review, it is possible that they were sufficient due to other lifestyle factors including playing an outdoor sport and being more ambulatory.One study that measured seasonal variations [ 46] reported that there was no sig - nificant seasonal variation in their sampled indoor and outdoor Para-Athletes.This lack of seasonal variation contrasts with the vast literature which typically supports the significant changes in vitamin D from seasonal varia - tion shown in previous research that concerns both Para- Athletes [ 49] and athletes without impairments [ 62].The lack of seasonal variation outlined by Pritchett et al.
[ 46] is likely due to 25(OH)D being measured in the autumn followed by the winter, which likely captured vitamin D at its nadir but not its peak, which is typically during the summer months [ 63]. Therefore, when comparing 25(OH)D from autumn to winter, Pritchett et al.[ 46] may have not seen a great enough change in vitamin D for it to be significant due to sampling in consecutive seasons.Nonetheless, all articles in this review suggest that many Para-Athletes are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency all year round.This systematic review identified that based upon the 25(OH)D averages in each of the included studies that there were no vitamin D sufficient indoor Para-Athletes and that there was just one study that reported sufficient levels of vitamin D in outdoor Para-Athletes in the sum - mer.This review shows similar results when compared to previous research, which suggests that indoor ath - letes have lower vitamin D levels compared to outdoor athletes.
Flueck et al. [ 50] reported consistent results when compared with previous studies that investigated training environment differences in athletes, concluding that indoor Para-Athletes were at higher risk of vitamin insufficiency and deficiency.The influence of training environment is echoed in a study investigating seasonal variations in 30 (15 indoor, 15 outdoor) female college athletes, which found outdoor athletes to have 25(OH) D levels of 13 ng ˑml− 1 (32.37 nmol ˑl− 1) more in the win - ter (March) and 7 ng ˑml− 1 (17.43 nmol ˑl− 1) more in the summer (September) compared to indoor athletes [ 64].However, one of the retrieved articles, Pritchett et al.[ 46] reported no differences between indoor and outdoor ath - letes, this may be due to measures being completed in autumn and winter months, which would mean that any outdoor UVb exposure would likely be negligible, or too low to have a significant impact on serum 25(OH)D lev - els.
Therefore, these outdoor Para-Athletes would likely experience similar vitamin D exposure to their indoor counterparts [ 61]. Importantly, the findings from this review would encourage for indoor Para-Athletes to take greater pre-cautions all year round, such as aiming for more safe sun exposure and/or supplementation, even during the summer months, when trying to avoid vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency.Page 17 of 19 Langley et al.Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:96 The level of ambulation of the sampled elite Para-Ath - letes may influence the training environment and thus time spent outdoors which has been discussed above and shown to see a reduction in 25(OH)D.Within the included studies Magee et al.[ 43], was the only study to directly compare WC-bound Para-Athletes to more ambulatory Para-Athletes and reported significantly lower 25(OH)D levels among WC-bound Para-Athletes.
As sun exposure is related to outdoor time [ 65] and outdoor time has been shown to reduce with increased levels of sedentary behaviour, it could be suggested that individuals who have less physical function may be at higher risk of lower levels of 25(OH)D [ 7]. This sugges - tion can be supported by Nooijen et al.[ 7] who reported that compared to able-bodied controls, ambulatory indi - viduals with cerebral palsy were more sedentary (80 min) and performed less physical activity (48 min).Therefore, it is of importance for Para-Athletes who are WC-bound or have reduced physical function to acknowledge and modify their lifestyle factors that can improve their vita - min D levels, such as safe sun exposure in the summer months, vitamin D supplementation and improved diet.
Limitations Due to the lack of homogeneity between the included studies, which is commonly seen in studies investigat - ing Para-Athletes, due to varying impairment types and severity, we were unable to further synthesise and anal - yse the data from the included studies via meta-analysis. Therefore, while it was possible to ascertain a direction of the possible detected relationships, we were not able to quantify the overall effect size for each outcome.Of the ten included studies, there were publications which were secondary studies performed by the same authors, who likely collected or reused previous measurements of 25(OH)D from some of the same participants.This would therefore reduce the overall population size of unique participants that 25(OH)D is reflected in.Never - theless, this review is the first to identify the prevalence of low vitamin D in elite Para-Athletes around the world with varying impairments.
Future Recommendations Recommendations for future research are; (1) Stan - dardised thresholds for vitamin D status: To facili - tate direct comparisons, researchers should adopt standardised thresholds for assessing vitamin D levels such as those recommended by The Endocrine Soci - ety; (2) Exploring the impact of vitamin D on female Para-Athletes: Given the underrepresentation of female populations in existing research and as identified in this systematic review, further investigation into the effects of vitamin D on female Para-Athletes is crucial; (3) Expand - ing the research in Para-Sports and different impairment types: This broader exploration into Para-Athletes will contribute the growth of the existing literature in this field.
It is also recommended that practitioners should; (1) Proactively monitor their Para-Athletes vitamin D: To highlight if there is need for intervention such as, supple - mentation to avoid decrements in musculoskeletal func - tion and health; (2) Provide education on the sources and importance of vitamin D: Including dietary vitamin D rich sources and methods on how to increase circulating vitamin D through safe sun exposure. Conclusion Ten studies were included within this systematic review, where a high prevalence of low vitamin D (57.1% - sum - mer and 74.1% - winter) was identified in elite Para-Ath - letes, living at latitudes above 37°N.The included studies identified several risk factors which likely influence low vitamin D in Para-Athletes, including lower ambula - tion levels, training environment (indoor vs.outdoor), poor dietary intake and access to vitamin D rich sources and seasonal variations in sun exposure.
This system - atic review highlighted that vitamin D insufficiency rates were high in the summer months, demonstrating that low vitamin D may be an issue for Para-Athletes throughout the entire year. Therefore, the authors recom - mend the need for interventions such as improved diet, increased outdoor exposure and supplementation of vita - min D throughout the year.
