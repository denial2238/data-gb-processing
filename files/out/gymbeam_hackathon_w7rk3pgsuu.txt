The inability to parse vitamin A-mediated mechanisms from other metabolic mechanisms in humans with pathogenic endotypes, as well as the lack of data investigating how VAD affects the lung microbiome, remains a significant gap in the field. To address this unmet need, we compared molecular, metatranscriptomic, and morphometric data to identify how dietary VAD affects the lung as well as the lung microbiome.Our research shows structural and functional alterations in host-microbe-diet interactions in VAD lungs compared to vitamin A-sufficient (VAS) lungs; these changes are associated with epithelial remodeling, a breakdown in mucociliary clearance, microbial imbalance, and altered microbial colonization patterns after 8 weeks of vitamin A deficient diet.These findings confirm vitamin A is critical for lung homeostasis and provide mechanistic insights that could be valuable for the prevention of respiratory infections and disease.
INTRODUCTION Vitamin A deficiency and host lung pathology Vitamin A deficiency (VAD), combined with protein malnutrition, is the most common nutritional disorder in the world.1 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), VAD primarily affects low-income communities and developing countries, two demographics where recurrent respiratory infections are common and malnutrition is widespread.1,2 It is well-.

10-16 While these findings are noteworthy, determining causality with respect to diet- associated disease progression in human samples is difficult. Patients deficient in one vitamin are often deficient in other micronutrients.17 Combined with other cofactors such as lifestyle and genetic background, human studies lack the specificity needed to characterize the role of dietary vitamin A in lung function and homeostasis.A well-controlled mouse model can overcome these challenges.By administering a custom diet to isogenic littermates, we can isolate the functional and morphological effects of dietary VAD on the lung without undue nutritional or genetic influence.Another major clinical challenge is the inability to fully reverse the epithelial damage, risk of infection, and rate of mortality with vitamin A supplementation alone.18,19 In some cases, malnourished patients given excess vitamin A can cause a cytotoxic condition known as hypervitaminosis A in patients.

The lung and the microbiome It has been well-characterized that infectious agents impair lung function and repair mechanisms in VAD patients, but these studies fail to account for more complex host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions, leaving the mechanisms involved in these interactions largely unknown.22 Additionally, there are associations between the composition and diversity of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) microbiome and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), asthma,23 ARDS,24 COPD,25 lung cancer,26 and SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage.27 These findings suggest that the LRT microbial microenvironment may trigger, predispose, or exacerbate lung pathogenesis. The airways are lined by a pseudostratified layer of epithelial cells which plays a major role in microbial elimination.Secretory cells secrete a mucinous layer that protects the apices of the airway epithelium by trapping the inhaled particles, potential pathogens, and commensal microbes within the mucin.
Ciliary cells work in concert to expel these substances through a process called the mucociliary escalator.9 The cilia beat in a semi-synchronous fashion to move the mucin-trapped microbes up and out of the lung; in this way, the lung is a unique microenvironment due to the transient nature of its microbial communities. When mucociliary clearance (MCC) is impaired, the microbes cannot be expelled effectively, providing a permissive niche for pathogenic microbial colonization and biofilm formation; 28 the subsequent dysbiosis may cause further epithelial injury, leading to chronic diseases.Here, we use a combined metatranscriptomic, morphometric, and functional approach to explore changes to the .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 22, 2024.

RESULTS ESTABLISHMENT OF THE VITAMIN A-DEFICIENT MOUSE MODEL Studies have shown serum and liver vitamin A levels do not accurately reflect the bioavailability of RA in the tissue12.This is because the concentration of RA is tightly regulated at both the tissue and cellular levels.Dietary vitamin A is absorbed into the small intestine and circulates in the body as retinol, where it is then taken into the cells.When the tissue has sufficient or excess RA, the retinol is converted to retinyl ester for storage, a process mediated by lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT).29 However, when there is a deficiency of RA (RAD), the oxidation of retinol to RA occurs, with a key step mediated by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH).
30 RA then enters the nucleus where it binds to retinoid X receptor (RXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) heterodimer known as the retinoic acid response element (RARE) to mediate transcriptional activity (Figure 1B).31-32 To determine whether we can achieve vitamin A deficiency in the adult mouse lung with dietary modulation, we maintained 8-week old wild-type C57BL/6J mice on a VAS or VAD diet for 8 weeks. We extracted the left lobes of the lung for bulk RNA sequencing while the right lobes were embedded for histology and immunohistochemistry.The sequences were then trimmed, aligned, and processed for downstream analysis (Figure 1A).Decreased Lrat expression indicates the conversion of retinol to the reversible storage form retinyl ester is reduced in VAD lungs.Conversely, increased Aldh1a1 expression indicates .

The observed VAD-induced airway remodeling is characterized by epithelial denudation and cellular debris, focal hyperplasia, thickening of the basement membrane, and an increase in protein expression of proliferative marker Ki-67 in the airway epithelium of both the proximal (Figure 2G-H) and distal regions (Figures 2I-J) of the LRT. 43 These findings indicate an increase in proliferation of airway epithelial cells in VAD lungs.To determine if the transcriptional signature implicates airway epithelium as the major cell types affected by host VAD status, we compared the genes upregulated in VAD lungs (p < 0.05) with gene signatures from the Tabula Muris mouse model transcriptome single-cell database.
44 Lung epithelium, ectodermal epithelial stem cells, and myeloid cells (Figure 2K) as well as pro-proliferation transcriptional factors FOXM1, JUN, and E2F4 (Figure 2L)45-47 were enriched in our VAD dataset, suggesting a measurable increase in epithelial and immune cell signatures following dietary modulation. Quantitative analysis shows a marked increase in focal regions of hyperplastic epithelium in VAD airways (Figure 2M, p = 0.0002).Further, quantification of Ki67-positive stained airway epithelial cells (Figure 2N) and the expression level of Mki67 , the transcript for Ki-67 protein, (Figure 2O) both support increased proliferation in VAD airway epithelium (Figures 2P-Q, outlined in red).These results were consistent with previously published data showing that vitamin A/RA pathway inhibition promotes proliferation in mouse and human lung epithelial organoids.48 .

Using images stained with histology and immunohistochemistry, we quantified secretory and multiciliated epithelial cell proportions in the airways (Figure 3B).These results also showed an increase in secretory epithelium in VAD airways compared to VAS, indicating that diet ary VAD-induced focal hyperplasia increases the proportion of secretory cells within the airways of the LRT.
We next performed immunohistochemistry to visualize the expression of secretory epithelial cell marker CC10 (the protein product of the transcript Scgb1a1 ), ciliated nuclear marker FOXJ1 (Figures 3C-D) and apical ciliary marker Tubb4a (Figures 3E-F).50-52 Briefly, several studies have found secretory protein CC10 expression upregulated in obstructive lung diseases and downregulated in restrictive lung diseases, making CC10 expression an important biomarker for lung health and disease. 53 Likewise, expression of nuclear FOXJ1 and ciliated TUBB4A proteins are known key regulators of motile ciliogenesis in the airway epithelium.54 SCGB1A1, a gene typically expressed within the secretory granules of club cells located at the apical portion of the cytoplasm, is now observed throughout the cytoplasm and along the basolateral region of club cells in hyperplastic regions of the VAD airway (Figures 3C-D).
Furthermore, immunostaining of TUBB4A expressi on is normally restricted to the cilia on the apical surface of multiciliated epithelium under VAS conditions. Our data demonstrates significantly reduced expression in the hyperplastic region of the VAD airway (Figures 3E-F).These findings confirm that dietary VAD leads to phenotypic changes characterized by a loss of apical protein expression of both major cells types in the intraparenchymal airways, two proteins that are critical for maintaining lung homeostasis through mucociliary clearance mechanisms.55 To determine the gene signature associated with these phenotypic changes, we performed gene set enrichment analysis of all differentially expressed genes in VAD lungs at 8 weeks (n=14, 619 genes with p < 0.05).The top three significant pathways from the Reactome .

Interestingly, the upregulated VAD gene set also showed enrichment for cell cycle pathways such as “Mitotic prometaphase”, “M phase”, “Cell cycle, mitotic”, and “Cell cycle” (Figure 3H), providing further evidence that dietary VAD leads to a hyperproliferative and ciliopathic gene signature in the LRT. Multiciliated cell structure and function is imperative for proper mucociliary clearance (MCC), the primary innate defense mechanism in the airway.56 To determine how these morphologic, genetic, and transcriptional changes affect MCC, we then performed an ex-vivo ciliary motility assay to visualize the cilia-driven flow in VAS and VAD airways.57 Briefly, tracheal explants were extracted and immediately placed in petri dishes containing L15 media with 20 /g2020l/ml of 0.2um fluorescent microspheres; this microsphere size is representative of most small particles, microbes, and other pollutants our lungs commonly trap and expel under homeostatic conditions.
Each petri dish was recorded using a Nikon Deconvolution Wide-Field Fluorescence Microscope (B15D) equipped with a camera and video acquisition software to measure the cilia-driven flow at 200 frames per second. Video frames were concatenated to create still images, allowing us to measure the velocity and distance traveled of individual beads (green lines).A minimum of 100 beads were measured for each arm of the study.In VAS lungs, the fluor escent beads are obser ved moving in a smoother, more efficient motion and follow a largely singular direction, indicating that cilia-driven propulsion in the VAS trachea is intact (Figures K,M).Conversely, VAD tracheas showed a significant reduction in velocity (Figure 3I, p<0.00001) and distance traveled (Figure 3J) of fluorescent microspheres .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

To date, there have been few longitudinal studies focusing on compositional changes to the lung microbiome over the course of a disease, and even fewer investigating how diet directly affects lung health over time. Longitudinal microbiome data from humans also tend to contain large batch effects due to the variability in cohorts, geographic location, extraction techniques, patient involvement, and environmental exposures.60 Luckily, the function and structure of cilia-related proteins responsible for proper motility and MCC are evolutionarily conserved, and can be easily studied in relation to the human lung using a standard isogenic mouse model.61 Based on our findings, we propose that chronic VAD may predispose adult mouse lungs to respiratory infections over time.For the purposes of this study, we define “chronic VAD” as maintaining an adult mouse on a VAD diet for 8 weeks, which is the equivalent of a human eating a VAD diet for approximately 7 years.
62 We extracted the microbial RNA from whole lung homogenates to sequence and analyze for compositional changes to the microbiome after 3 weeks and 8 weeks of dietary modulation respectively. Alpha diversity, or the measurement of diversity within samples 63 (Figure 4A), was performed on bacterial read counts at the Phylum level using the Mann-Whitney/Kruskal-Wallis statistical test.VAD samples exhibited an increase in alpha diversity compared to controls (p=0.072), indicating an increase in the diversity of bacterial .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.21.600110doi: bioRxiv preprint communities found within VAD lung samples..
Beta diversity, or the measurement of diversity between samples,64 was performed on bacterial transcripts using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index (Figure 4B) and showed VAS and VAD cohorts clustered separately with a p-value of 0.01. These results provide evidence of a statistically significant shift in bacterial composition in VAD lungs at 8 weeks.To see if the observed shift translated to an increase in bacterial burden, we measured the 16S gene expression within VAS and VAD lungs using qPCR.Briefly, qPCR is a method of quantifying the number of sequence copies within a sample.By amplifying the bacterial 16S cDNA within each sample, we are able to quantify the total bacterial content and calculate the bacterial load within a group of samples.65 QPCR results from whole lung homogenates (n=8) did not show a significant change in bacterial burden (p = 0.42, Figure 4C, Table S1), but these findings do not fully explain the functional shift in the VAD lung microbiome over time.
While absolute abundance is often considered more biologically relevant, many microbiome researchers choose to calculate the relative abundance of microbes within a host tissue instead, as these values can be more functionally relevant to predict dysbiosis and disease progression over time; parametric models like DESeq2 uses negative binomial distributions applied to normalized data to minimize hidden confounding factors from sample fractions. 66 By applying DESeq2 with FDR correction to our Log-transformed RNA read counts at 8 weeks (n=14), we confirmed both bacteria and fungi exhibited significant shifts in relative abundance (p = 0.025 and 0.020 respectively, Figure 4C).Specifically, relative bacterial burden did increase in VAD lungs over time (Figure 4D), although major shifts in bacterial composition were not evident until week 8 (Figure 4E) where pathobionts such as Planctomycetes were the most abundant.
67 Meanwhile, the relative abundance of Ascomycota - a fungal phylum known to be beneficial for human health - plummeted as early as week 3 and maintained the same level of abundance at week 8 (Figure 4F). 68-70 .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 22, 2024.
; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.21.600110doi: bioRxiv preprint To determine the functional relevance of the compositional changes in VAD lungs over time, the bacterial metadatabase BacDive was used to annotate the RNA read counts of whole lung samples collected at 3 weeks and 8 weeks (n=32).71 VAS samples at 3 weeks and 8 weeks were combined to represent the control lung cohort (n=16), and any differences in the relative abundance of VAS microbes between t hese two time points at the Phylum level were insignificant (data not shown). Interestingly, the relative abundance of bacteria classified as antibiotic resistant are largely depleted at week 8 (Figure 4G).This change in gene expression could be due to the increased relative proportion of rare and low-abundance bacteria in VAD lungs that have yet to be classified as functionally relevant to human health.We also observed an overabundance of aerobic bacteria at the 8-week timepoint in the VAD lung (Figure 4H, outer ring).
Since vitamin A is an antioxidant, 72 these results suggest chronic VAD may lead to an increase in oxidative stress within the lung, which in turn could lead to the preferential selection of oxygen-tolerant microbes. We also observed an increase in the relative abundance of gram- negative bacteria compared to gram-positive bacteria in VAD lungs at 8 weeks, suggesting either a selective increase in gram-negative bacteria or transcriptional quiescence of gram- positive bacteria (Figure 4I).Of note, our results are consistent with human studies where bacteria undergo a functional change towards colonization and oral biofilm formation; researchers investigating the development of dental plaque following a meal observed a reduction in the relative abundance of gram-positive bacteria in late biofilm samples, with different molecular pathways activated between early and late biofilm formation.
73 Specifically, KEGG analysis of late biofilm transcripts were enriched for pathways involved in cellular transport, cell motility including pilus and flagella assembly, and DNA/mismatch repair, the same pathways enriched in our mouse dataset (Figures 3G-H, other data not shown). Therefore, our data suggests chronic VAD shifts the microbial composition of the LRT towards dysbiosis and early pathogenesis.This shift is .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.21.600110doi: bioRxiv preprint evidenced by a reduction in the relative abundance of Ascomycota and gram- positive bacteria, as well as an increase in the relative abundance of oxygen-tolerant microbes mor e broadly, predisposing the VAD lung to infections and disease.

To analyze microbiome data at the species level, we used the BatchQC80 Shiny App R package to correct our raw read counts for unidentified batch and covariate effects that could skew our results. Using the app, we first normalized the species-level log-transformed read counts using DESeq, 66 followed by Limma81 for differential expression analysis (Figure 5B).Our volcano plot depicts the p-value (x-axis) and significance value (y-axis) for the compositional change of each species.Of the six microbes that met the significance threshold, Saprocaete from the Ascomycota Phylum was the only fungi significantly altered (green dot).We also observed an increase in Methylobacterium expression from the Pseudamonadota phylum, a species known for healthcare-associated infections.
82 While changes in gene expression can indicate changes in microbial abundance, significant alterations in gene expression within a particular taxa can also indicate a functional shift from a planktonic or non-adherent state to a sessile or adherent state. 75 To determine whether the VAD-induced dysbiosis translates to changes in lung colonization patterns, we analyzed bacterial Gram stains of the mouse airway after 8 weeks of dietary modulation .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.21.600110doi: bioRxiv preprint (Figures 5C-F).We observed 3-dimensional biofilm structures containing gram-positive bacteria in VAD lungs (Figures 5E-F, black arrows) that were not observed in VAS lungs .
The exception was a VAS sample with a biofilm attached to a vessel containing a granuloma (data not shown). We also observed a large cohort of planktonic gram-negative bacteria along the VAD airway epithelium (Figure 5E, green arrows), indicating that gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria may have distinct stress responses associated with host VA status in the lung.To determine causality in relation to lung-microbe interactions, we wanted to investigate whether the microbiome can rescue or exacerbate the VAD and VAS lung phenotypes respectively.To that end, we extracted the lung microbiome from mice maintained on diets for 8 weeks and administered daily intratracheal (IT) injections of VAS and VAD microbes into VAD and VAS mouse lungs respectively for 3 weeks.It is important to note that while our extraction technique removed larger host and immune cells, signaling molecules and other immune cell milieu could not be removed from the samples using our extraction and IT protocol.
83 Therefore, our daily microbial transplants contained the microbes and molecules found within the airway of the LRT. Interestingly, early signs of invasion and colonization by gram-positive bacteria were observed in VAS lungs exposed to VAD microbial transplants for 3 weeks (Figures 5G-H).VAD lungs receiving VAS microbial trans plants also had evidence of biofil m formation (Figures 5I-J), although these structures could have persisted from the 8-week time point when the IT microbial transplants began.These results confirm that host VAD status leads to bacterial invasion, colonization, and an increased risk of infection in the LRT of adult mouse lungs.
While our transplant data provides evidence that VAD microbes exhibit post-biofilm invasion and colonization patterns in VAS lungs, more evidence is needed to determi ne whether a VAS microbial transplant is an effective prophylaxis towards slowing the progression of epithelial remodeling, dysbiosis, and bacterial colonization in VAD lungs. .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 22, 2024.

Metatranscriptomic analysis showed a reduction in fungal abundance and an increase in bacterial abundance in VAD lungs at week 8. Histological staining of bacteria confirmed these findings, while also providing evidence of a VA-mediated mechanism that triggers colonization in gram-positive but not gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that vitamin A may be involved in gram-specific quorum sensing mechanisms.Transcriptional data confirms changes in fungal composition precede measurable changes to the bacterial consortium, suggesting that VA- mediated quorum sensing mechanisms in the LRT are polymicrobial in nature.A promising future direction of this work towards detection of respiratory infection is the observed fungal sensitivity to host vitamin A status.
Ascomycota, the most abundant fungal Phylum found in humans worldwide, dramatically reduced transcriptional activity at our earliest time point in VAD lungs; this change in transcription preceded the hyperplasia and the bacterial biofilm formation. Therefore, future studies investigating the mycobiome and vitamin A may uncover useful and sensitive biomarkers for early detection of airway remodeling and infection in malnourished patients.CONCLUSION Dietary vitamin A deficiency (VAD) causes epithelial remodeling in the lower respiratory tract characterized by epithelial denudation, focal hyperplasia, thickening of the smooth muscle, and a loss of ciliary function.Fo cal hyperplasia leads to an enric hment of secretory cells and a .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Female mice also allowed us to co-house mice shipped in different cages, which would enable us to control for cage effects in our preliminary study. 84 We also used female mice to remove sex effects from the preliminary results, which is another covariate that could have skewed our findings.Mice were purchased as littermates or siblings to minimize genetic drift as another covariate.Four mice were shipped in each cage; following the acclimation period, mice were separated evenly into each arm of the study and housed with a female from a different cage to ensure any variation in the microbiome due to cage effects was shared evenly between the two dietary treatments.Cage localization and variation in microbes on the cages themselves can drastically affect the outcome of lung microbiome research.
84 Considering these findings, we changed the cage, food, water, and bedding as well as rotated the cages in the rack every 2-3 days so that each cage was never 1) next to the same cages or 2) in the same location on the rack more than once throughout the entire study. .CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.21.600110doi: bioRxiv preprint We provided each cage with a custom research diet created by Envigo® that was either Vitamin A-sufficient (VAS) or VAD (Catalog # TD.91280 and TD.86143).The chow was sterilized, irradiated, and vacuum-sealed to prevent microbial contamination.
The left lobe of each lung was paraffin embedded for histology and immunohistochemistry, while the right lobes were homogenized for mixed host-microbe bulk RNA-seq (Figure 1A). RNA Isolation and Extraction The following protocol was designed by our lab to achieve mixed RNA samples with a higher microbiome RNA yield than previously published techniques.To do so, we tested many approaches and combined portions of three separate protocols for maximum results; a portion of our modified GentleMACS® technique created by our lab for FACS sorting and whole lung digest, a portion of the Qiashredder® tissue disruption and homogenization protocol to maximize mammalian RNA extraction, and a portion of the PureLink® RNA extraction and DNase Digest for maximum 16S and mixed microbiome sample RNA integrity.The following is our novel mixed host-microbe RNA extraction protocol: Preparation: Mice were euthanized using isoflurane with cervical dislocation as a secondary method.
To ensure minimal cross-contamination, dissection tools were sterilized in 100% ethanol for one hour before placing in a surgical tray. Dissection supplies and pre-aliquoted sterile solutions were placed in a metal surgical tray, the tray sealed in a transparent bag, and processed through a ThermoFisher CL-1000 UV crosslinker once (catalog # 95-0174-01, serial # 061608-001).Without opening the bag, items were turned over and processed through the UV crosslinker again.The supplies remained in the sealed transparent bag until it was time for lung extraction.The bag was sterilized with 70% ethanol before placing in a fume hood to open for use..CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 22, 2024.
; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.21.600110doi: bioRxiv preprint Extraction : Lungs were extracted using sterile forceps and dissecting scissors. The trachea and as much of the connective tissue as possible were removed from the lower respiratory tract (LRT) while the sample was still within the thoracic cavity to minimize contamination.The left lobe was placed in a canonical tube containing 4% paraformaldehyde and placed on ice.The right lobe was placed in a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube, previously sterilized in the surgical tray, containing 1mL of RNAlater and placed on ice.The left lobes were stored in a 4°C refrigerator until the next day.Whole Lung Tissue Disruption and Homogenization : Each lobe that was previously placed in RNAlater was transferred to a gentleMACS® M-tube with 1.2mL of RLT buffer from the Qiagen® RNeasy mini kit.24 /g2020L 2M DTT was added to the tube, and then homogenized using the gentleMACSTM Octo-dissociator).
Two programs were used that are pre-programmed and standard for this machine; the “m_lung_01_01” setting was run once, followed by two rounds of “RNA_01_01”. The M-tubes were then centrifuged on 15,000 rpm for 2 minutes.Up to 650 /g2020L of the supernatant was transferred into a QiaShredder spin column by Qiagen® (catalog # 79656 ), keeping the M tubes on ice.Qiashredder columns were centrifuged at 12,000 xg for 2 minutes before adding 50 /g2020L of RNA-free water directly onto the spin column and centrifuging for another 2 minutes at 12,000 x g.The flow-through tubes were capped and placed on ice between each transfer of the spin column.Pellet Disruption and Homogenization : 100 /g2020L of lysozyme solution was added to the M tubes (see STARS methods section) and vortexed to resuspend the pellet.8 /g2020L of 1% SDS solution was added before vortexing and transferring the samples to Eppendorf tubes.
Using a 21-gauge needle, we rapidly filled and expelled a 1 mL sy ringe 15-20 times to ensure the bacterial cell walls had been denatured. The tubes were then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 2 minutes at room temperature before transferring the supernatant to a clean RNA-free microcentrifuge tube..CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.It is made The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 22, 2024.; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.21.600110doi: bioRxiv preprint RNA Extraction : 250 /g2020L of 100% ethanol was added to each tube and vortexed briefly.Each sample was transferred into a spin cartridge with a collection tube from the Purelink® RNA extraction kit and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 seconds at room temperature.The flow- through was discarded but not the collection tube.
350 /g2020L of Wash Buffer I was added to the column to repeat the previous step once before discarding and replacing the collection tube. We were sure to use only one spin cartridge per sample tube collected from the homogenization steps.Even though fewer spin cartridges could reduce contamination and the potential for sampling bias, performing too ma ny centrifuges with the same spin cartridge will clog the membrane and dramatically reduce the RNA yield.DNA Digest : 80 /g2020L of DNase Digest solution from the Purelink® DNase digest protocol was added to each spin cartridge and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature.500 /g2020L of Wash buffer II was added to each spin column and centrifuged for 15 seconds at 12,000 x g.Flow-through was discarded from the collection tube before repeating the previous step.The spin cartridge was placed into a clean 1.5mL Eppendorf tube for its final elution and collection phase.
40 /g2020L of RNA-free water was added to the center of the spin column before incubating for 1 minute followed by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 1 minute. Another 40 /g2020L of RNA-free water was added around the edges of the spin column and the previous incubation and spin steps were repeated once per spin cartridge.Each spin column collected from the same sample was placed into the same Eppendorf collection tube for the elution stage.Each collection tube was vortexed to combine elutions well before verifying the RNA yield and quality using a NanodropTM spectrophotometer.Using the protocol outlined above, the RNA we collect averages a perfect nucleic acid 260/280 ratio of 2.0-2.1, and an excellent RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 9.1-9.9.Our designed protocol is exhaustive, requiring an entire day for extraction and three separate RNA processing kits plus .

The 10 samples at 3 weeks and 14 samples at 8 weeks with the best quality and yields were approved for further processing and library preparation, with 260/280 scores ranging from 2.0 to 2.1 and yields from 40.4 ng/uL to 284.6 ng/uL. To increase the sequencing depth of the microbiome in our mixed samples, BUMSR performed mouse rRNA depletion prior to sequencing.Next Generation total RNA-sequencing was performed using the Illumina NextSeq2000.Samples underwent two sequencing runs using a P2 flow cell for the first run and a P3 flow cell for the second run to increase sequencing depth.Each run repeated for 200 cycles with 100x100 base pair paired- end reads.The final sequencing depth was approximately 1.77 b illion read pairs, ranging from 60.7-86.9 million reads for each of the 24 samples collected ( Table 3 ).
Sequence Pre-processing and Alignment : Raw FastQ files of single paired-end reads were trimmed based on minimum Illumina phred scores of 33 using the Trimmomatic package version 0.36.85 The trimmed sequences were aligned to bacterial, fungal, viral, and miscellaneous microbial gene indices downloaded from Refseq86 while filtering out samples that also aligned to human and mouse gene indices from Refseq.

; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.21.600110doi: bioRxiv preprint RNA-Seq Data Analysis Raw read counts were loaded into two R-based Shiny Apps for preliminary data analysis: for the microbiome, Animalcules89 version 1.4.0 in RStudio version 4.0.2, and for the host, Single Cell Toolkit90 version 1.9.1 in RStudio version 4.1.1. Within the Single Cell Toolkit platform, the host RNA-seq read counts were normalized using the Limma R/Bioconductor software package,91 version 3.44.3 in Animalcules and version 3.48.3 in Single Cell Toolkit.Alpha and beta diversity plots were generated in MicrobiomeAnalyst.76 P-values for diversity plots were calculated in the app using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test with continuity correction model.BatchQC was used to normalize feature counts using Combat and DESeq.Paraffin-embedding and sectioning lung tissue Left lobes were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight at 4°C.
We then paraffin-embedded the lungs by clearing the tissues in serial dilutions of ethanol and xylene and processing the tissues in a 60°C vacuum oven with paraffin wax for 3 hours. The tissues were left to harden at room temperature before storing in the 4°C fridge until sectioning.Paraffin- embedded tissues were sectioned into 5 /g2020m tissue slices using a microtome.The tissues were left in a 37°C oven overnight to cure before storing in a 4°C fridge until staining.Immunohistochemical staining Protocols for each stain were followed using the guidelines specified by their respective manufacturers; Scgb1a1/CC10 from Santa Cruz Biotech (catalog # sc-365992), Acetylated tubulin from Sigma-Aldrich catalog # T7451, and Foxj1 from Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog #14-9965-82.Our lab added 0.2% Tween at the blocking stage to permeate cells for sufficient surfactant protein C staining but all other staining protocols did not require this step.
