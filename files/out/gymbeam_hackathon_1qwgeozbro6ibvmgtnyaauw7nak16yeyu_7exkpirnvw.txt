The consumption of nutri- tional compounds with the ability to positively inﬂuence the oxidative balance and an exacerbated inﬂammatory process has been previously studied. However, little is known about the nutritional value of curcumin (CCM) when mixed with whey protein concentrate (WPC).This study was de- veloped to evaluate the effect of CCM-added WPC on inﬂammatory and oxidative process control and histopathological consequences in muscle tissue submitted to an exhaustive swimming test (ET).(2) Methods: 48 animals were randomly allocated to six groups ( n= 8).An ET was performed 4 weeks after the start of the diet and animals were euthanized 24 h post ET.(3) Results: WPC + CCM and CCM groups reduced IL-6 and increased IL-10 expression in muscle tissue.CCM reduced carbonyl protein after ET compared to standard AIN-93M ET and WPC + CCM ET diets.Higher nitric oxide concentrations were observed in animals that consumed WPC + CCM and CCM.
Consumption of WPC + CCM or isolated CCM reduced areas of inﬂammatory inﬁltrate and ﬁbrotic tissue in the muscle. (4) Conclusions: WPC + CCM and isolated CCM contribute to the reduction in inﬂammation and oxidative damage caused by the exhaustive swimming test.Keywords: exhaustive swimming test; curcuma; bioactive compounds; antioxidants; inﬂammatory process; oxidative stress; experimental study 1.Introduction Exhaustive exercise can induce muscle damage [ 1,2], which, consequently, causes the development of inﬂammatory responses and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals inducing oxidative stress in the muscle tissue [ 2].Inﬂammation and oxidative stress induced by exhaustive exercise are indispensable for tissue recov- ery; however, when exacerbated and uncontrolled, they can cause secondary muscle damage [1,3] .
Thus, strenuous exercise and secondary muscle damage can reduce muscle strength, impaired neuromuscular function, fatigue, a reduced range of motion, and muscle soreness [ 4–6]. In addition, this muscle damage can decrease muscle function, affecting physical activities and performance [ 3,7].Therefore, strategies that control or minimize muscle damage, attenuate exacerbated inﬂammatory responses, and improve performance are increasingly studied [6,8].In this context, consuming products with antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory proper- ties has become common and necessary to treat muscle damage [ 4,8].Among the nutritional Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4905.https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14224905 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4905 2 of 17 compounds that are capable of promoting a good response in the function muscle tissue is curcumin (CCM), the main curcuminoid extracted from Curcuma longa L, which has re- ceived considerable attention.
Studies have shown that CCM can positively affect different illnesses due to its antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, and immunoregulatory effects, which highlight its cardioprotective, antineoplastic, and hepatoprotective potential [ 9–11]. In addition to its demonstrated health beneﬁts, polyphenol curcumin has also been shown to improve performance in physical exercise by reducing muscle pain and damage [ 3,12–14], which is characterized by sarcolemma disruption, extracellular myoﬁber matrix abnormal- ities, swelling or disruption of the sarcotubular system, and distortion of the myoﬁbril contractile components, to name a few [15].Whey proteins (WP) have become widely consumed as a nutritional supplement because of their leucine content, digestibility , and ability to activate muscle protein synthesis [11,16] .
In addition to their efﬁcacy and safety, these proteins have high biological value and metabolic efﬁciency, optimizing recovery from strenuous exercise and sports performance, strength, and muscle hypertrophy [ 17,18]. Studies suggest that the use of WP can also attenuate oxidative stress and exercise-induced inﬂammation, as well as aid recovery after resistance training [ 16,19,20].The beneﬁts of WP are mainly related to its concentration of bioactive peptides [ 21].In addition, it was previously demonstrated that WP rich in leucine acts as an anabolic signal, decreasing the levels of ubiquitinated proteins and inhibiting proteasome activity, decreasing muscle atrophy [22].Previous studies have shown that CCM and whey protein ingestion alone can attenuate muscle damage induced by unusual exercise [ 3,18,20,23,24].
However, current scientiﬁc knowledge is lacking in regard to the potentiation of the beneﬁcial effects of CCM-added WP , especially concerning the maintenance of muscle tissue integrity, the improvement of the oxidative balance, or the attenuation of inﬂammatory responses, and consequently, the histopathological changes in the muscle during the practice of strenuous exercise. Thus, and in order to bridge this gap, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of curcumin-added whey protein concentrate (WPC) on the oxidative balance, inﬂammation process, and histopathology changes of the muscle of Wistar rats submitted to an acute protocol of exhaustive physical exercise.2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Feedstock 2.1.1.Curcumin The curcumin used in this study was Theracurmin®(Theravalues, Tokyo, Japan), which is highly absorbable.This product has more bioavailability than conventional CCM.2.1.2.
Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) The milk for the manufacture of whey protein concentrate was obtained from the stable of the Federal University of Viçosa-MG, being submitted to microﬁltration. The whey-drying procedure was carried out in a LabMaq MSD 1.0 single-level spray dryer (Ribeir ão Preto, SP , Brazil), according to the methodology of Perrone et al.(2013) [25].2.1.3.Curcumin-Added Whey Protein Concentrate CCM was mixture to WPC to obtain a product with a concentration of 0.8 g of curcumin in every 100 g of WPC, and an intake of 3.0 mg/kg/day of curcumin (maximum ADI value for humans [ 26]) was considered for a 70 kg individual [ 27].Therefore, the protein supply to the animals through WPC corresponded to 30% of the requirements for rats in the maintenance phase [28].2.2.
Animals and Experimental Diets Forty-eight male rats (young adults) of the Wistar strain (Rattus novergicus, variety albinus, Rodentia), 12 weeks old, were randomly divided into six experimental groups with 8 animals each ( n= 8/group), as follows: (i) the control group that received a standard diet Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4905 3 of 17 (AIN-93M); (ii) the control group that received a standard diet submitted to the exhaustive test (AIN-93M ET); (iii) the curcumin-added whey protein concentrate group (WPC + CCM); (iv) the curcumin-added whey protein concentrate group submitted to the exhaustive test (WPC + CCM ET); (v) the curcumin group (CCM); and (vi) the curcumin group submitted to the exhaustive test (CCM ET) (Figure 1).

The experimental diets specific to each group (formulated and produced in the laboratory of experimental nutrition at UFV, according to the AIN-93M recommendations proposed by the American Institute of Nu trition (1993) [29]) were introduced and maintained for 4 weeks (Table 1). The animals received water and their experimental diets ad libitum.Diets were normocaloric, normoproteic and normolipidic.The animals were Figure 1.Flow diagram depicting the study design.AIN-93M: group that received a standard diet; WPC + CCM ET: group that received curcumin-added whey protein concentrate; CCM: group that received curcumin; ET: exhaustion test.Based on CONSORT [28].The experimental diets speciﬁc to each group (formulated and produced in the lab- oratory of experimental nutrition at UFV , according to the AIN-93M recommendations proposed by the American Institute of Nutrition (1993) [ 29]) were introduced and main- tained for 4 weeks (Table 1).
The animals received water and their experimental diets ad libitum. Diets were normocaloric, normoproteic and normolipidic.The animals were distributed in individual cages in a temperature-controlled environment (22◦C±2◦C) and automatically controlled 12 h light/dark cycles.Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4905 4 of 17 Table 1.Composition of experimental diets.Ingredients g/kg of Diet AIN-93M WPC + CCM CCM Cornstarch 455.7 455.7 455.7 Albumin1150.0 105.0 150.0 Maltodextrin 155.0 155.0 155.0 Sucrose 100.0 99.0 99.0 Soybean oil 40.0 40.0 40.0 Cellulose 50.0 50.0 50.0 Mineral blend 35.0 35.0 35.0 Vitamin blend 10.0 10.0 10.0 L-cystine 1.8 1.8 1.8 Choline bitartrate 2.5 2.5 2.5 WPC2- 44.0 - Theracurmin®- 1.2 1.2 Reeves et al., 1993; AIN-93M: standard diet for maintenance phase rodents; WPC: whey protein concentrate; CCM: curcumin.1Albumin was considered to have 80% protein content.2WPC with 82.4% protein content was considered.
The animals from the groups AIN-93M ET, WPC + CCM ET, and CCM ET were sub- mitted to the exhaustive test after 4 weeks of experiment. The rats swam to exhaustion, supporting a loading equivalent to 4% of the body weight ﬁxed to the tail (the exhaus- tion protocol was modiﬁed) [ 30].Exhaustion was deﬁned as when the animal remained submerged for 10 s [31].At the end of the experimental period and 24 h after the exhaustive test, the animals were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (Isoforine, Crist ália®, Itapira, Brazil) and euthanized.Skeletal muscle tissues (gastrocnemius and biceps) were removed, weighed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80◦C until analysis.All experimental procedures were carried out following the ethical principles of animal experimentation.2.3.
Analysis of Oxidation Products and Activity of Antioxidant Enzymes The muscle tissue samples (gastrocnemius) were weighed (300 mg) and homoge- nized in 1.5 mL of cold PBS (pH 7.4) using an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (T10 basic Ultra- Turrax, IKA®, Campinas, SP , Brazil). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×gfor 10 min at 4◦C.The supernatant was used for enzymatic analysis and the evaluation of oxidation biomarkers.Catalase (CAT), determined by its ability to cleave hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) into water and molecular oxygen, was evaluated as proposed by Aebi (1984) [ 32].Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, deﬁned as the amount of enzyme that causes a reduction in pyrogallol autooxidation, was performed according to the method proposed by Dieterich (2000) [ 33].The activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was obtained from its ability to metabolize 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), conjugated to reduced glutathione, following the methodology described by Habig (1981) [34].
The concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was determined as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) of lipid peroxidation, according to the methodology proposed by Buege and Aust (1978) [ 35]. The production of NO was estimated by the production of NO 2/NO 3by the standard Griess reaction and followed the methodology of TSIKAS (2007) [ 36], and the oxidative damage of muscle proteins, indicated by the levels of carbonyl proteins (CP), was measured according with the method of Levine (1990) [ 37].The results were normalized to the total protein concentration of the supernatant using the method described by Lowry (1951) [38].Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4905 5 of 17 2.4.Cytokine Proﬁle in Muscle Homogenate The muscle samples (200 mg) were homogenized using a tissue homogenizer (IKA WORKS GMBH and CO, Staufen, BW, Germany, model T10) in PBS buffer (pH 7.0), cen- trifuged (10,000×g, for 10 min at 4◦C), and the supernatant recovered.
The cytokines Interleukin-2, Interleukin-10, and tumor necrosis factor were determined by a FACSVerse ﬂow cytometer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) by the Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) follow- ing the manufacturer’s recommendations (BD). Data were processed using FCAP Array v3.0 software, and the results were expressed in pg/g tissue.2.5.Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) The relative expression level was assessed by a qPCR in an Illumina Eco®real-time polymerase chain reaction system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), using the GoTaq®1-Step RT-qPCR System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).After extraction, the RNA from the muscle samples (gastrocnemius) was quantiﬁed using the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc).The sequences of the primers that were used are described in Table 2.The analysis was performed using the 2 −∆Ct method in EcoStudy®software (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), using GAPDH as an endogenous control.Table 2.Sequences of primers for qPCR analysis.

From 10 photos per histology slide, the areas containing muscle ﬁber, connective tissue (which was considered ﬁbrosis when the quantity of collagen was exacerbated), and inﬂammatory inﬁltrate in the muscle were quantiﬁed using the ImagePro-Plus®application version 4.5 (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA) by manually counting points on the tissue [39]. 2.7.Blood Lactate Analysis during the Exhaustion Test Blood samples (25 µL) were collected at two stages: before (rest) and after the end of the exhaustive swimming test (ﬁnal 60 s of testing), following the protocol of Gobatto et al.(2001) [ 40], with modiﬁcations.The blood samples were collected from the tail end of the animal ( n= 8).The animals were quickly dried with a towel before blood collection to avoid dilution with water.Lactate concentration was determined using the Accutrend Check automated blood lactate analyzer (Accusport—Roche, Basel, Switzerland).Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4905 6 of 17 2.8.

Data expressed as mean ± standard deviation.4.Discussion Acute and exhaustive exercise is associated with increased tissue stress, especially inflammation, oxidative stress, and, consequently, changes in muscle morphology [2].In this context, curcumin and whey proteins have been shown to be safe for consumption and exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects [18,21,41].Overall, our results showed that the consumption of curcumin-added whey protein concentrate had positive effects on oxidative balance and the developme nt of inflammation in the muscle tissue, with a consequent change in muscle morpho logy.Thus, we can highlight a reduction in oxidative markers, an increase in antioxidant enzymes, and a reduction in inflammation and blood lactate after perfor ming the exhaustive test.
Muscle damage resulting from unusual and exhaustive exercise is related to the production of free radicals and, consequently, ROS associated with inflammation [42], which can lead to cellular damage, such as membrane disorganization, protein oxidation, and the alteration of cellular functions [43] . Increased oxidative st ress associated with an inability of the endogenous antioxidant syst em to remove excess free radicals impairs recovery and decreases exercise performance [42,44].Substances reactive to thiobarbituric ac id (TBARS) or MDA, and carbonyl protein levels are products of the oxidation of biomolecules and are commonly used as biomarkers and indicative of oxidative stress [45].In turn, enzymes such as CAT, SOD, and GST are used as parameters to reflec t the antioxidant status [46].
Our study demonstrated that SOD concentrations remain ed similar amonggroups, possibly because there was not enough free radical production to activate the antioxidant enzyme system beyond what the cell normally expresses. Th e curcumin-added whey protein concentrate, as with the exposure to isolated curcumin, provided higher antioxidant activity due to greater recruitment of the catalase enzyme by performing the exhaus tive test.Our results show that WPC and CCM can significantly activate antioxidant enzymes in muscle tissue and, consequently, have a protective activity for the tissue.Howeve r, surprisingly, CAT concentrations among animals not submitted to ET were lower in the CCM group, probably due to lower H2O2 formation or an ability of curcumin itself to reduce H2O2 Figure 7.Blood lactate levels and swimming time.( a) Blood lactate levels collected at resting and 2 min after performing the exhaustive swimming test.( b) Swimming time.

Discussion Acute and exhaustive exercise is associated with increased tissue stress, especially inﬂammation, oxidative stress, and, consequently, changes in muscle morphology [ 2]. In this context, curcumin and whey proteins have been shown to be safe for consumption and exert antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory effects [ 18,21,41].Overall, our results showed that the consumption of curcumin-added whey protein concentrate had positive effects on oxidative balance and the development of inﬂammation in the muscle tissue, with a consequent change in muscle morphology.Thus, we can highlight a reduction in oxidative markers, an increase in antioxidant enzymes, and a reduction in inﬂammation and blood lactate after performing the exhaustive test.
Muscle damage resulting from unusual and exhaustive exercise is related to the production of free radicals and, consequently, ROS associated with inﬂammation [ 42], which can lead to cellular damage, such as membrane disorganization, protein oxidation, and the alteration of cellular functions [ 43]. Increased oxidative stress associated with an inability of the endogenous antioxidant system to remove excess free radicals impairs recovery and decreases exercise performance [42,44].Substances reactive to thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) or MDA, and carbonyl protein levels are products of the oxidation of biomolecules and are commonly used as biomarkers and indicative of oxidative stress [ 45].In turn, enzymes such as CAT, SOD, and GST are used as parameters to reﬂect the antioxidant status [ 46].
Our study demonstrated that SOD concentrations remained similar amonggroups, possibly because there was not enough free radical production to activate the antioxidant enzyme system beyond what the cell normally expresses. The curcumin-added whey protein concentrate, as with the exposure to isolated curcumin, provided higher antioxidant activity due to greater recruitment of the catalase enzyme by performing the exhaustive test.Our results show that WPC and CCM can signiﬁcantly activate antioxidant enzymes in muscle tissue and, consequently, Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4905 13 of 17 have a protective activity for the tissue.However, surprisingly, CAT concentrations among animals not submitted to ET were lower in the CCM group, probably due to lower H2O2 formation or an ability of curcumin itself to reduce H2O2 levels.
It is worth mentioning that our data are based on the analysis of enzyme activity and not on their gene expression; therefore, we believe that future studies are necessary to clarify the possible mechanisms of action and consequent tissue alteration. The administration of the protein concentrate mixed with curcumin allowed for a re- duction in lipid peroxidation induced by free radicals and ROS, such as H 2O2, provoked by the performance of the exhaustive swimming test.Similarly, a study with male rats under- going resistance exercise training to induce muscle damage also demonstrated the positive modulatory effects of dietary curcumin, with attenuation in MDA concentrations [ 14].In the current study, due to its antioxidant properties, CCM was able to reduce protein oxida- tion, one of the main processes responsible for the misfolding of proteins within the rough endoplasmic reticulum and, consequently, for their malfunction.
A previous study by our research group [ 47] found that CCM consumption was responsible for reducing MDA concentrations, and that exposure to CCM, as well as WPC + CCM, was able to reduce concentrations of PCN in the liver. Our current ﬁndings partially corroborate the previous study.The differences found could possibly be related to the investigated tissue, since the liver is the main metabolism organ and, therefore, where the most relevant alterations are found.Under conditions of oxidative stress, high levels of superoxide ion react with nitric oxide (NO), forming a reactive nitrogen species (RNS), consequently producing peroxynitrite [48] .It is already known that NO suppresses the installation of an inﬂammatory process by decreasing lymphocyte activation and by decreasing leukocyte adhesion, preventing the rolling and migration of cells and, consequently, inhibiting the installation of a tissue inﬂammatory process [ 49,50].
These reports corroborate our ﬁndings, since treatments with WPC + CCM and CCM showed increased NO levels and decreased inﬂammatory inﬁltrate foci in the tissue. After unusual and/or prolonged exercise, muscle damage stimulates the inﬂammatory response through the recruitment of immune system cells, such as neutrophils [ 42], which send signals for the migration of macrophages that, in turn, mediate the expression of inﬂammatory cytokines, growth factors, ROS, and RNS directly involved in the progression of inﬂammation [ 43].Thus, the inﬂammatory process must be controlled to avoid persistent tissue damage due to the continuous action of free radicals [ 43].The WPC and CCM represent a promising therapy in controlling inﬂammation after exhaustive exercise, as reduced IL-6 expression levels and increased IL-10 levels directly reﬂect attenuation of the inﬂammatory response provoked by the exercise and improve muscular recovery.
Increased IL-6 in skeletal muscle is related to the incidence of muscle damage induced by strenuous and/or exhaustive exercise [ 51]. A potential explanation of the lower concen- tration of IL-6 in the groups that consumed the WPC + CCM or the isolated CCM is probably related to the high concentrations of WPC bioactive peptides and the concentrations of CCM in the blood, which were maintained during and after exercise.Previous studies have also reported that the inﬂammatory response is suppressed when curcumin is ingested several days before exercise [ 23,52].Corroborating our results, Davis et al.(2007) [ 53] showed that curcumin could reduce IL-6 and TNF- αconcentrations after eccentric exercise, controlling inﬂammation and protecting tissue.We also observed an increase in the levels of IL-10 expression in the muscle of the animals submitted to the exhaustive swimming test, which received the WPC + CCM or the isolated CCM.
IL-10 is an anti-inﬂammatory cytokine that acts by suppressing the activation of immune cells after the emergence of an initial inﬂammatory response [ 54]. The increase in IL-10 concentration can accelerate the inﬂammatory recovery process [ 6].Curcumin has been shown to induce the expression and release of IL-10 [ 55], which partly explains its anti-inﬂammatory effects.In our previous study [ 47], we also observed increased IL-10 concentrations in the liver of Wistar rats that received WPC + CCM or isolated CCM.Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4905 14 of 17 The analysis of the inﬂammatory cytokine proﬁle showed that, although without statistical signiﬁcance ( p> 0.05), the WPC + CCM ET group showed a tendency towards lower concentrations of TNF- α.However, levels of IL-10 in its protein form could not be detected.
These results suggest that after the production of mRNA for IL-10 (as detected by RT-qPCR analysis), there was a deactivation of M1-type macrophages and an increase in M2-type macrophages reducing exercise-induced inﬂammation. The anti-inﬂammatory role of WPC is related to its concentration of bioactive peptides, present in whey proteins, which can be generated by enzymatic hydrolysis, microbial fermentation, or through the gastrointestinal digestion of food proteins [ 21].The ingestion of isolated CCM has been shown to be effective in the reduction in pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, since CCM can negatively regulate the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enzymes, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), lipoxygenase, and xanthine oxidase activity, suppress- ing the activation of NF- κB [56].
To corroborate our ﬁndings, histological evaluations also indicated less inﬂammation in both the animals that received WPC + CCM and the animals that only received CCM, demonstrating the ability to reduce inﬂammation. In addition, it was also possible to observe an increase in area and diameter muscle ﬁbers in these groups, which may be related to the increase in muscle strength.It was also possible to observe that the animals of the control group exhibited a more pronounced connective tissue when compared to the animals of the WPC + CCM and CCM groups.Increased connective tissue, formed mainly by type III collagen ﬁbers, consequently implies decreased muscle ﬁbers.In general, the thickening of collagen ﬁbers is related to some type of injury, usually the beginning of the ﬁbrotic process and cell death [ 57,58].
These ﬁndings are possibly associated with the chronicity of inﬂammation and the development of degenerative processes that culminate in cell death with consequent collagen deposition. The exhaustive swimming test caused morphological changes that may have led to cell death and increased tissue ﬁbrosis.However, more studies are needed to investigate such effects.Surprisingly, we observed that the groups that received the AIN93M diet showed in- creased inﬂammation in muscle tissue, as well as the development of increased connective tissue and muscle atrophy.The high carbohydrates content and low protein presented in this diet could be related to this result.In its formulation, the AIN93M diet contains 70% of carbohydrates and only 15% of protein impairing protein synthesis.
Furthermore, it is known that an increased fats and carbohydrates’ intake in the diet may be related to mechanisms that are involved in lipidic metabolism, such as a reduction in lipoprotein for- mation, inﬂammatory processes, and free radicals responsible for lipid chain peroxidation. A previous study by our research group also reported damage caused by the consumption of standard AIN-93M diet by showing that animals fed this diet showed increased fat in hepatocytes.Exhaustion in swimming rats is a complex type of stress that generates central and peripheral fatigue, since the animals are highly motivated to avoid drowning, and thus, factors such as thermal and emotional stress are difﬁcult to eliminate [ 30].In our test of endurance swimming to exhaustion, rats supporting loads of 4% of their body weight usu- ally reached maximal blood lactate stabilization around 4–6 mmol/L, which is indicative of peripheral fatigue [ 40,59].
More importantly, our results show that the group supple- mented with WPC + CCM showed lower lactate levels after the exhaustive swimming test. Elevated levels of lactate in muscle and blood during exercise can provoke sensations of pain and discomfort, increasing the perception of exertion and, consequently, reducing performance [ 60].Similar ﬁndings were demonstrated by Sahin et al.(2016) [ 14] in their study with male Wistar rats submitted to an exercise protocol, in which 20 mg of curcumi- noids was provided per day for 6 weeks.The authors found that serum lactate levels in the supplemented group decreased compared to control group levels.This study corroborates our previous ﬁndings that the consumption of WPC + CCM and isolated CCM contribute to the reduction in inﬂammation and oxidative damage caused by the exhaustive swimming test, despite the low dose of CCM offered (3 mg/kg/day).
It is Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4905 15 of 17 important to emphasize that these markers do not directly reﬂect muscle damage; however, they can be used with other variables to infer muscle changes resulting from exhaustive physical exercise. Future studies are needed to clarify the acute and chronic mechanisms related to the antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory responses generated by the consumption of WPC + CCM and isolated CCM, and an evaluation for a longer time after performing an exhaustive test.5.Conclusions The consumption of WPC + CCM and/or isolated CCM for four weeks before perform- ing an exhaustive swimming test was able to reduce the inﬂammatory response through the reduction in IL-6 and increase in IL-10.In addition, the consumption of WPC + CCM was able to reduce the lipid peroxidation caused by exhaustive exercise, and the consumption of CCM reduced the concentrations of carbonylated protein.
Higher nitric oxide levels were observed by the consumption of WPC + CCM and CCM, evidencing a possible cardiopro- tective action. Furthermore, the consumption of WPC + CCM and CCM was able to reduce the areas of inﬂammatory inﬁltrate and connective tissue in the muscle caused by exhaus- tive exercise, as well as increase the area and diameter of muscle ﬁbers.The association of WPC + CCM also allowed for lower lactate production during exhaustive exercise.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, K.A.D., A.R.d.C., S.M.S.P ., L.A.O., R.V .G., H.S.D.M.and C.M.D.L.; methodology, K.A.D., A.R.d.C., S.M.S.P ., J.V .d.S.R.and R.S.D.; validation, R.S.D., A.J.N., H.S.D.M.and S.L.P .d.M.; formal analysis, K.A.D., A.R.d.C., S.M.S.P ., L.A.O., J.V .d.S.R.and R.S.D.; investigation, K.A.D., A.R.d.C.and S.M.S.P .; resources, A.J.N., S.L.P .d.M., S.O.d.P ., E.T., C.M.D.L., R.V .G.and H.S.D.M.; writing—original draft preparation, K.A.D., A.R.d.C., S.M.S.P .
