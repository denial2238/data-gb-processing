This study focused on determining the optimal conditions for an enzyme (Ultimase MFC) ex- traction to enhance the bioactive components of underutilize d ginger leaves using the response surface method.The ex- tracted material was evaluated in terms of its yield and antiox idant capacity (total phenolic content, total flavonoid con- tent, and activities of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2‚Äô-a zino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6- sulfonic acid).
As a result, the optimal conditions included an enzyme concentration of 0.1% (v/v), a liquid-solid ratio of 33.939 mL/g, and an extrac- tion time of 4 h. The optimized conditions resulted in an improvement in yield and antioxidant capacity, except for the total phenolic content of ginger leaves, when compared to the reference control extract.Additionally, the possibility of im- proving immunity was confirmed as nitric oxide and cytokines increased in macrophage cells compared with non-treatment control.Therefore, these extraction conditions enhance the pote ntial industrial value of ginger leaves and underscore their promise as a natural ingredient for functional foods.Keywords: by-product, enzymes, ginger, leaf, macrophages INTRODUCTION The agri-food industry produces substantial amounts of plant byproducts each year during the cultivation and processing of agricultural products.
However, many dis-carded agri-food byproducts and waste materials contain valuable compounds that retain significant functionality and bioactivity. These include various plant parts, such as seeds, leaves, stems, and roots, and represent untapped sources of natural antioxidants (Louren√ßo et al., 2019).However, at present most byproducts are not exploited as potential sources of beneficial compounds.This is de- spite the fact that chemical extraction of antioxidant-rich compounds from discarded byproducts has revealed that the inedible parts of fruits and vegetables often possess higher concentrations of bioactive components than the edible parts (Echegaray et al., 2018).Moreover, there is growing interest in discovering new natural materials present in byproducts that may be recovered and used as high-value-added functional materials.Ginger is a root crop known for its unique aroma and taste, and is widely consumed around the world.
The primary active ingredients in ginger include gingerol and shogaol, along with zingiberol, zingiberene, and ÔÅß-cardi- nen (Mao et al., 2019). These active compounds have been found to possess both antioxidant and anticancer properties (Shukla and Singh, 2007).In 2022, 37,000 Mg of ginger were produced, of this ginger leaves accounted for 15,770 Mg, representing 46.2% of the total ginger har- vest.Although ginger leaves have been approved for use i n f o o d s b y t h e M i n i s t r y o f F o o d a n d D r u g S a f e t y i n Korea since April 2017, their agricultural utilization rate remains low (Im et al., 2021).Chan et al.(2009) reported that ginger leaves also contain active ingredients similar to those found in ginger roots, including significant quan- tities of phenols.Moreover, quercetin and kaempferol gly- cosides have recently been identified in ginger leaves, as well as flavonols (Nam et al., 2021).
The potential of gin- ger leaves for use as a processed food ingredient remains significant, with robust protective effects having been Optimization of Ginger Leaf Extraction 229 demonstrated against various chronic conditions includ- ing inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and gastroin- testinal disorders (Sasidharan and Menon, 2010). Considerable research has been performed on the anti- oxidant activity of plants, including their leaves, and it is known that leaf-associated antioxidants can regulate bio-logical defense and immune functions via similar mecha- nisms, thereby mitigating the effects of disease and com- bating aging processes (Kim and Kim, 2005).Although research has been conducted on the physiological activ- ities of ginger leaves (Park et al., 2014), effective methods for extracting and using active ingredients present in gin-ger leaves remain poorly understood (Chen et al., 2020).
In contrast to conventional extraction methods, enzyme- assisted extraction (EAE) can result in faster extraction, lower energy consumption, higher extraction yield, and lower solvent usage (Mari ƒá et al., 2018). In this study, we investigated the ability of different EAE methods to enhance the antioxidant capacity of gin- ger leaf extracts.In addition, we also used a response sur- face methodology (RSM) approach to optimize ginger leaf extraction (GLE) using Ultimase MFC then evaluated the immune-stimulating effects of extracts on macrophages.MATERIALS AND METHODS MaterialsGinger leaves were first harvested from plants grown at the Seasoning Vegetables Research Institute (November 2021).After harvest, we washed harvested leaves three times under running water and discarded plant stems.The leaves were then dried at 60¬∞C for 40 h using a hot air dryer (DS-240BC, Doosung Co., Ltd.) before being ground into a fine powder using a 0.2-mm mesh.
Chemicals and enzymes 2,2‚Äô-Azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), (+)-catechin, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ascorbic acid, Folin-Ciocalteu phenol reagent, gallic acid, sodium nitrite (NaNO 2), aluminum chloride (AlCl 3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium persul- fate (K 2S2O8), sodium carbonate (Na 2CO 3), and lipopoly- saccharide (LPS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ultimase MFC (cellulase), papain, and pectinex (pecti-nase) were purchased from Novozymes.Experimental design for GLE RSM was applied to determine the optimal extraction conditions for GLE.Related statistical analyses were con- ducted using Minitab version 17 (Minitab Inc.).Extraction conditions included three independent variables, i.e., en- zyme concentration (v/v%), extraction time (h), and the liquid/solid (LS) ratio (mL/g) .The values of these vari-ables were established using a Box-Behnken design.
The response variables measured included the extraction yield, total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), DPPH radical scavenging activity and ABTS radi- cal scavenging activity. Ultimase MFC, a form of cellulase, was selected due to its antioxidant-related performance after comparing it to papain or pectinase (Supplementary Table 1).GLE was then obtained using Ultimase MFC, with all procedures performed in accordance with the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.The optimal temperature and pH for this enzyme were 50¬∞C ‚àº60¬∞C and 4.5 ‚àº6.5, re- spectively.For all experiments dried ginger leaves were first coarsely ground then finely ground.A mixture of 5 g of finely ground ginger leaf powder, distilled water, and enzyme was kept at 50¬∞C for extraction.The result-ing extract was then treated by inactivating the enzyme in boiling water for 30 min, then centrifuging and filter- ing the resulting mixture using Whatman No.2 filter paper (Whatman Inc.).
To obtain reference control ex- tract (RCE), we used the extraction method used by Chen et al. (2020) with slight modification.Briefly, ex-tractions were conducted at 50¬∞C for 90 minutes using a 1:1:1 ratio of cellulase, papain, and pectinase.The sub- sequent process was performed in the same manner as for GLE.The yields of all extracts were quantified by weighing both the dried raw material sample and the freeze-dried extract.TPC determination We determined the TPC was determined by modifying the Folin-Ciocalteu method (Dewanto et al., 2002).Brief- ly, 50 ÔÅ≠L of the sample was first mixed with 1 mL of 2% Na 2CO 3 at room temperature (RT).Subsequently, 50 ÔÅ≠L of 1 N Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was added and the mix- ture was then left to react at RT for 30 min.After this reaction, 200 ÔÅ≠L of each sample was transferred to wells of a 96-well plate, and the absorbance was measured at 750 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax M2e, Molecular Devices).
The TPC was calculated using gallic acid as a standard and all results are expressed as gallic acid equivalents (mg GAE/g). TFC determination TFC was determined following the method of Zhishen et al.(1999), with modifications.Briefly, 125 ÔÅ≠L of sam- ple, 500 ÔÅ≠L of distilled water, and 38 ÔÅ≠L of 5% NaNO 2 were first mixed and left to react at RT for 5 min.Next, 75 ÔÅ≠L of 10% AlCl 3 was added and the mixture was again left to react at RT for 5 min.Finally, 250 ÔÅ≠L of 1 M NaOH was added, and this mixture was left to react at RT for 11 min before the absorbance was measured at 510 nm.TFC was then calculated using catechin as the standard, and all measurements were expressed as cat- echin equivalents (mg CTE/g).230 Kim et al.DPPH radical scavenging activity The DPPH radical scavenging activity of extracts was measured as per the protocol described by Blois (1958).
Briefly, a 0.2 mM DPPH solution was prepared by dilut- ing DPPH reagent in absolute ethanol, and this sample was then diluted to 5 mg/mL in distilled water. Next, 160 ÔÅ≠L of the DPPH solution and 40 ÔÅ≠L of sample were mixed and left to react in the dark for 30 min.After re- action the absorbance was measured at 517 nm; the rad-ical scavenging activity (%) was then calculated as the absorbance ratio between groups with and without in- cluded sample (i.e., relative to a negative control).ABTS radical scavenging activity We then quantified the ABTS radical scavenging activity as per the method described by Re et al.(1999).Briefly, a mixture of 7.4 mM ABTS solution and 2.6 mM K 2S2O8 solution was prepared for 16 h in the dark to generate radicals.The ABTS radical solution was diluted with dis- tilled water until it reached an absorbance value at 734 nm of 1.0¬±0.05.
Next, 50 ÔÅ≠L of this sample was mixed with 150 ÔÅ≠L of the diluted ABTS solution, and the ab- sorbance was measured at 734 nm after incubation at RT for 15 min. Cell cultures RAW264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage cell line, were ob-tained from the Korean Cell Line Bank and used for all culturing experiments.These cells were first cultured in Dulbecco‚Äôs modified Eagle‚Äôs medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin.Cell cultures were then maintained in an incubator (311-TIF, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37¬∞C with 5% CO 2 and were sub- cultured.Cell viability, nitric oxide (NO) assays, and quantification of cytokine production Cell viability was assessed using the Ez-Cytox kit (Daeil Lab Services Co.).Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were first seeded onto 96-well plates (2√ó10 4 cells/well) and were cultured for 24 h.The cells were then treated with GLE and RCE and incubated for an additional 24 h.
After this incubation, 10 ÔÅ≠L of Ez-Cytox reagent was added to each well, and cells were incubated for a further 3 h. Subse- quently the absorbance was measured at 450 nm.Cell viability was expressed as the survival rate of the treat- ment group relative to a negative control group.Next, to assess NO production, 100 ÔÅ≠L of cell culture supernatant and 100 ÔÅ≠L of Griess reagent were com- bined and allowed to react at RT for 15 min.Absorbance was then measured at 540 nm using a microplate reader.Finally, the cytokine [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- ÔÅ°, in- terleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1 ÔÅ¢] and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) contents of culture supernatants were measured using an ELISA kit (eBioscience Co.).Here, LPS (1 ÔÅ≠g/mL) was used as a positive control to enable activity comparisons.Statistical analyses All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 24.0 (IBM Corp.).
The means and standard devi-ation were calculated for each experimental group, and the statistical significance of differences the means of two groups were evaluated using Student‚Äôs t-tests. More- over, differences among multiple group means were eval- uated using one-way ANOVA, followed by Duncan‚Äôs mul- tiple range test.The statistical significance of differences were evaluated at P<0.05.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Optimization of GLE conditions In this study, ginger leaves treated with enzymes were subjected to extraction under 15 conditions designed us- ing RSM .In each case this was followed by the evalua-tion of antioxidant capacity.Our analysis involved mea- suring yield and TPC, TFC, DPPH, and ABTS, the results of which are presented in Table 1.Our results show that the yield increased 11.5 times relative to a nonenzymatic control, and ranged from a minimum yield of 3.62%¬± 0.54% to a maximum extraction yield of 41.66%¬±2.30%.
As expected, the extraction yield increased with higher enzyme concentration and extraction time, and this can be attributed to the decomposition of polysaccharides such as hemicellulose, starch, and pectin within the cell wall (Boulila et al., 2015). In particular, we observed an increase in yield as the LS ratio rose (Jisieike and Betiku, 2020).The tendency for yield to increase with enzyme concentration is consistent with the findings of Nadar et al.(2018).Moreover, according to Chen et al.(2011), cel-lulase degrades leaf cell walls more effectively than pec- tinase and significantly transglycosylates flavonol agly- cones into soluble polar compounds, which therefore in-creases extractability.In addition, Ultimase MFC can fa- cilitate the release of bioactive compounds that are loose- ly bound to cell wall polymers by hydrolyzing (1,4)- ÔÅ¢- D-glucosidic linkages that exist between cellulose and other ÔÅ¢-D-glucans (Krakowska-Sieprawska et al., 2022).
Furthermore, Ultimase MFC shows ÔÅ¢-glucosidase activ- ity (Park et al., 2021). Since ÔÅ¢-glucosidase has extensive functions, a suitable enzyme can be used to specifically break down the substrate and produce a desired bio-active decomposition product (Singh et al., 2016).Here, we found that TPC increased by 1.4 times and TFC by 1.2 times, and that both TPC and TFC tended to de-crease as the enzyme concentration and extraction time increased.These results are consistent with the mass transfer principle and with previous studies that have Optimization of Ginger Leaf Extraction 231 Table 2.

demonstrated a positive relationship between LS ratios on flavonoid content and extraction yield (Tan et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2013; Elboughdiri, 2018). Next, ABTS radical scavenging activity showed a similar pat-tern to those of TFC and TPC.Interestingly, DPPH radi- cal scavenging activity was highest (55.31%¬±4.58%) at intermediate enzyme concentrations and at low LS ratios.Overall, these findings demonstrate the importance of considering multiple factors, including enzyme concen- tration, extraction time, and LS ratio, to optimize GLE conditions.Next, we expressed the relationship between the inde- pendent variables Ôºçi.e., enzyme concentration (v/v%, X 1), extraction time (h, X 2), and LS ratio (mL/g, X 3)Ôºçwith different response variables as a quadratic polynomial regression equation; these results are expressed in Table 2.
TPC was deemed significant with a P-value below 0.05; however, it was excluded from the optimal variable set due to its relatively low coefficient of determination (R 2=0.611), since equations with R2 values less than 0.7 may have insufficient explanatory power (Kim et al., 2021). Therefore, we designated yield, TFC, ABTS, and D P P H a s k e y o p t i m i z a t i o n v a r i a b l e s .O p t i m i z a t i o n w a s then carried out to determine which extraction conditions maximized these variables.The corresponding response surface plots for each of these variables are presented in Fig.1.Optimal extraction conditions were found to be as follows: 0.1% (v/v) enzyme concentration, a 4 h ex- traction time, and a 33.939 mL/g liquid ratio.The over- all satisfaction value was observed to be 0.76.
Next, to validate the predicted range of optimization variables and optimized extraction conditions, we then conducted a comparison between the predicted and actual experi-mental values of the optimization variables (Banik et al., 2020); these results are presented in Table 3. Based on these validation results, the relationships established for the optimization variables concerning yield, TFC, DPPH, and ABTS fell within a 95% confidence interval.This re- sult suggests that the formulated equations for the ex-traction conditions accurately predict response variables 232 Kim et al.Fig.1.Response surface plots for ginger leaf enzyme extraction meth-ods.(A) Yield (%), (B) total phenolic content (TPC) (mg GAE/g), (C) total flavonoid content (TFC) (mg CTE/g), (D) 2,2‚Äô-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothia-zoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging activity (%, inhibition), (E) 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity (%, inhi-bition).

Thus, the EAE of ginger leaves, which contain high antioxidant ca- pacity and flavonoids, appears to be possible. Next, yield, TPC, TFC, DPPH, and ABTS radical scavenging activity values were compared between GLE and RCE (Fig.2).Our results showed that these values were significantly Optimization of Ginger Leaf Extraction 233 Fig.2.C o m p a r i s o n o f a n t i o x i d a n t c a p a c i t y a n d y i e l d b e t w e e n g i n g e r l e af extract obtained using the optimized method (ginger leaf extraction, GLE) and the reference control extract (RCE).(A) Total phenolic content (TPC) (mg GAE/g) and total flavonoid content (TFC) (mg CTE/g), (B) 2,2‚Äô-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-s ulfonic acid (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) ra dical scavenging activity (%, inhibition), (C) yield (%).GLE vs.RCE according to an independent t-test (*P<0.05, ***P<0.001).GAE, gallic acid equivalent; CTE, catechin equivalent; NS, not significant.
higher for GLE than for RCE ( P<0.05), except for TPC. Taken together, these results demonstrate that GLE is generally a more effective extraction method than RCE, especially since a higher yield implies the elution of a greater quantity of functional and beneficial components.Effect of GLE on immune stimulation in macrophages To assess the safety of GLE for potential food applica- tions, we then assessed whether the extract exerted an effect on cell viability as measured using RAW 264.7 cells (Fig.3A).Overall, neither GLE nor RCE exhibited cytotoxic effects within the tested concentration range of 2.5‚àº40 ÔÅ≠g/mL.For example, the measured cell survival rate remained ‚â•95%, reflecting a lack of toxic side effects (Hibbs et al., 1987).Based on this threshold, our data indicate that concentrations of up to 40 ÔÅ≠g/mL are safe.Next, we examined the effect of the extract on macro- phage activation.
NO is a reactive nitrogen intermediate produced by macrophages in response to stimulation by cytokines or microorganisms, and is therefore generally considered to be a reliable indicator of macrophage acti-vation. In addition, NO is also involved in immune acti- vation and antioxidant activity by minimizing cytotoxicity caused by cell-activating subs tances and reactive oxygen intermediates (Cho et al., 2010; Byun, 2013).As an active oxygen species, NO is also involved in the regulation of physiological functions including vasodilation, platelet ag-gregation, and immune response under normal condi- tions (Hyun, 2011).Furthermore, an increase in NO in macrophages without LPS treatment is considered an immunostimulatory effect (Zhang et al., 2021).In this study, a group in which NO was secreted by treatment with LPS was used as a positive control group; Fig.3B depicts NO production in response to GLE and RCE treatment in the absence of LPS stimulation.
For all sam- ples, we observed an increase in NO production com-pared to the untreated group. Moreover, GLE increased NO production in a concentration-dependent manner up to 3.6-fold compared to the untreated control, whereas RCE increased NO levels up to 1.6-fold.These results suggest that, in addition to its antioxidant properties, GLE also contributes to immune activation by promot-ing NO production.Next, we examined the effect of the extracts on cyto- kine production.In general, cytokines are proteins se-c r e t e d b y i m m u n e c e l l s t h a t r e g u l a t e v a r i o u s i m m u n e cell functions, play roles in effector cell activation, and eliminate external pathogens (Yoo et al., 2014; Park et al., 2017).Increases in cytokine production (within their nor- mal range) generally signify enhanced immune activity, and various natural products have been reported to boost immune activity by increasing cytokine production (Gupta et al., 2022).
Among the major cytokines involved in in- nate immunity, TNF- ÔÅ°, IL-6, and IL-1 ÔÅ¢ are secreted when activated macrophages initiate an immune response. As shown in Fig.3C ‚àº3F, immune-activating cytokines (TNF- ÔÅ°, IL-6, and IL-1 ÔÅ¢) increased significantly in a concen- tration-dependent manner in the GLE group.Moreover, both GLE and RCE treatments increased TNF- ÔÅ° and PGE2 levels in a concentration-dependent manner, but TNF-ÔÅ° levels were consistently higher in the GLE treat- ment.TNF- ÔÅ° contributes to host defense against invad- ing pathogens, and also regulates immune responses by inducing the secretion of other cytokines (Elshal and Hazem, 2022).IL-6 is primarily generated during the ini- tial immune response to infection and/or tissue damage, and the expression of the IL-6 gene is known to be stimulated by other immune factors including TNF- ÔÅ° (Tanaka et al., 2016).
In addition, both IL-1 ÔÅ¢ and TNF- ÔÅ° play roles as mediators of the inflammatory response and are significant parts of the cytokine network (Arango Duque and Descoteaux, 2014). In response to GLE treat-ment, we found that both IL-6 and IL-1 ÔÅ¢ exhibited in- creases, whereas no such increases were observed for any RCE group.GLE was therefore expected to enhance immune system activation by increasing the expression of TNF-ÔÅ°, IL-6, IL-1 ÔÅ¢, and PGE2 in macrophages.Our results suggest therefore that GLE stimulates the activa- 234 Kim et al.Fig.3.Ginger leaf extraction (GLE) exerts an immunostimulatory effec t on macrophages.(A) Cell viability was measured using the Ez-Cytox test.(B) Dose-dependent effects of ginger leaf ex tract obtained using the optimized method (GLE) and the referen ce control extract (RCE) on nitric oxide production were determine d using a Griess reagent assay.(C) Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -ÔÅ°, (D) interleukin (IL)-6, (E) IL-1 ÔÅ¢, (F) prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).
