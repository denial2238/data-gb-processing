We investigated the effects of consuming an egg-free diet, three egg whites per day, and three whole eggs per day for 4 weeks on comprehensive clinical metabolic, immune, and hematologic proﬁles in young, healthy adults (18–35 y, BMI < 30 kg/m2or <30% body fat for men and <40% body fat for women, n = 26) in a 16-week randomized, crossover intervention trial. We observed that average daily macro- and micronutrient intake signiﬁcantly differed across egg diet periods, including greater intake of choline during the whole egg diet period, which corresponded to increased serum choline and betaine without altering trimethylamine N-oxide.Egg white and whole egg intake increased serum isoleucine while whole egg intake reduced serum glycine—markers of increased and decreased risk of insulin resistance, respectively—without altering other markers of glucose sensitivity or in- ﬂammation.
Whole egg intake increased a subset of large HDL particles (H6P , 10.8 nm) and decreased the total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio and % monocytes in female participants using combined oral contraceptive (COC) medication (n = 11) as compared to female non-users ( n = 10 ). Whole egg intake further increased blood hematocrit whereas egg white and whole egg intake reduced blood platelet counts.Changes in clinical immune cell counts between egg white and whole egg diet periods were negatively correlated with several HDL parameters yet positively correlated with measures of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and insulin sensitivity.Overall, the intake of whole eggs led to greater overall improvements in micronutrient diet quality, choline status, and HDL and hematologic proﬁles while minimally—yet potentially less adversely—affecting markers of insulin resistance as compared to egg whites.

Introduction Eggs are a rich source of bioactive nutrients and dietary compounds with roles in the regulation of metabolic health, lipid metabolism, immune function, and hematopoiesis [ 1–3].The composition of egg white and egg yolk fractions are distinct [ 4].While high biological value protein and B vitamins are provided by both egg whites (10.9 g protein/100 g) and egg yolks (15.9 g protein/100 g), egg yolks additionally serve as a relatively rich source of Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747.
https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15173747 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 2 of 24 choline-containing glycerophospho- and sphingolipids, fatty acids (34.7% saturated, 48.7% monounsaturated, and 16.7% polyunsaturated), water-soluble forms of choline, cholesterol, all vitamins except vitamin C—including the majority of B vitamins that are also present in lower amounts in egg whites. Eggs are additionally rich in minerals and essential trace elements, with egg yolks providing more grams of calcium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, phosphorous, selenium, and zinc per 100 g, whereas egg whites are relatively richer in magnesium, potassium, and sodium [ 5].Further, egg yolks contain antioxidant carotenoids, including lutein and zeaxanthin [ 6].Accordingly, eggs are recognized as the most cost- effective animal source of protein and numerous micronutrients, which may reduce disease burden of at-risk and underserved populations.
Egg consumption is additionally associated with greater overall nutrient density and quality of the diet [7–9]. Given the potential nutritional beneﬁts and socioeconomic accessibility of egg intake, the effects of egg consumption on clinical measures of nutritional status, cardiometabolic risk factors, and hematologic (mainly erythrocyte) proﬁles have been evaluated in observa- tional and intervention studies; however, the results are often inconsistent and controversial, which may in part be due to differences in study designs (number of eggs per day, du- ration of egg treatment), populations (healthy vs.metabolic dysfunction), background diets (weight stable vs.weight loss), and individual variability between subjects [ 10–16].Further, studies often focus on a narrow range of biomarkers rather than providing a comprehensive assessment of standard clinical metrics, which is essential for determining the balance of potential beneﬁcial vs.adverse responses to diet.
As a result, studies have reported varied changing and null effects on serum lipids, lipoprotein proﬁles, and serum inﬂammatory markers [ 1,17] in addition to conﬂicting effects on serum trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) [ 18,19]—a pro-atherogenic choline-derived metabolite produced by gut bacteria [ 20]—despite recent epidemiolocal studies ﬁnding null or beneﬁcial associations between egg intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes [ 14,21]. Similarly, while epidemiological studies have reported conﬂicting associations between egg intake and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk [ 15,22], intervention studies often report a null or beneﬁcial effect of egg intake on traditional markers of insulin resistance [ 10,19,23] and do not incorporate emerging biomarkers, such as plasma concentrations of branched-chain amino acids and glycine [ 24,25].
Further, studies report minimal to no effects of egg intake on improving anthropometric and erythrocyte proﬁles [ 16,26,27] and fail to incorporate an assessment of clinical immune proﬁles—despite the utility of white blood cell (WBC) and differential leukocyte counts in predicting chronic disease risk [ 28,29] and evidence from animal and human studies suggesting that egg intake alters immune cell gene expression, responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide, and pathogen defenses [30–33]. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the effects of consuming an egg-free, egg white, and whole egg diet on comprehensive clinical markers of diet quality, nutritional status, cardiometabolic risk, and hematologic proﬁles that are commonly assessed in healthcare settings and are controversial and/or lacking assessment in dietary intervention trials.
We conducted this trial in young, healthy adults to evaluate diet effects without the complica- tion of metabolic dysfunction or additional background diet confounders. In a subgroup analysis, we further evaluated whether the use of combined oral, hormone-based contra- ceptive (COC) medication in female subjects impacted the response to egg diets, given that COC use is prevalent in groups representative of our study population (young women aged 18–35 y), and the use of COC has been shown to impact cardiometabolic and immune measurements assessed in this study [34–37].2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Study Participants Twenty-eight women and men were recruited and enrolled to participate in a 16-week randomized cross-over dietary intervention trial.
Participants were eligible for the study if they were age 18–35-years-old at the time of screening, had a BMI < 30 kg/m2or <30% body fat for men and <40% body fat for women, and were willing to consume eggs and Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 3 of 24 egg whites on a daily basis during study periods. Individuals were excluded from the study if they had a self-reported history of diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke, renal problems, liver disease, cancer, autoimmunity, chronic infections, egg allergy, or current pregnancy or lactation.Additional exclusion criteria included taking lipid-lowering medications (e.g., statins, ﬁbrates) and having a preexisting medical condition or implanted medical device that prevents participation in bioelectrical impedance measurements of body composition.Individuals were additionally excluded if they had fasting triglyceride levels higher than 500 mg/dL, fasting glucose higher than 126 mg/dL, and plasma total cholesterol greater than 240 mg/dL.
Information on health history and use of medications and/or dietary supplements was collected via a medical questionnaire, whereas fasting blood lipid and glucose levels were measured in blood obtained via ﬁnger prick utilizing a Cholestech LDX analyzer and Lipid Proﬁle + Glucose cassettes (Alere, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) at screening. Body mass index (kg/m2) was calculated following measurement of body height and weight.Body height was determined utilizing a Tanita HR-200 wall- mounted height rod (Tanita Corporation of America, Arlington Heights, IL, USA), whereas body weight and body fat composition was measured utilizing a Tanita SC-240 digital scale with bioelectrical impedance function.This study was approved by the Fairﬁeld University Institutional Review Board (protocol #0511), and all subjects provided written, informed consent prior to screening.This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03577223).2.2.
Study Design and Dietary Intervention The 16-week dietary intervention utilized a randomized cross-over design. Following enrollment into the study, participants entered a 4-week egg-free diet run-in period, during which they were asked to refrain from consuming whole eggs, egg whites, or predominantly egg-based foods where egg fractions constituted more than a minor ingredient (egg-free diet).Participants were then randomly assigned to consume either 3 large shelled whole eggs/day (whole egg diet) or the equivalent of 3 large egg whites (0.5 cup liquid egg whites, Wholesome Farms, Sysco Corporation, Houston, TX, USA)/day (egg white diet) for 4 weeks.Participants then entered a 4-week egg-free washout period, followed by assignment to the alternative whole egg- or egg white-based diet treatment for the ﬁnal 4 weeks of the intervention.
All whole eggs and egg white food products were pasteurized and provided to the participants, who were asked to refrain from consuming any outside egg products. Whole eggs were provided as shelled eggs to provide participants with greater ﬂexibility in preparation during the whole egg diet period, and 100% egg whites were provided in cartons during the egg white diet period.Egg white ingredients included egg whites, guar gum, and triethyl citrate as whipping aids.Participants were allowed to consume study eggs at any time of day using preferred cooking methods and instructed to fully cook eggs for food safety.Table 1 summarizes the difference in nutrition composition for each daily egg treatment (equivalent to 3 large whole eggs or 3 large egg whites per day).Participants were asked to maintain their habitual dietary patterns, level of physical ac- tivity, and usage of supplements and medications throughout the duration of the study, all of which were monitored by surveys.
Of note, approximately half of the female participants were taking combined oral contraceptive (COC) medication (n = 11, n = 10 non -users). Par- ticipants were weighed using a digital scale every two weeks to ensure weight maintenance throughout the intervention.A total of 29 individuals were screened for participation in the study.One individual did not meet the study criteria and was excluded from participating in the study.Twenty- eight participants (twenty-one female, seven male) met the study criteria and were enrolled into the study.Two participants (both male) withdrew for reasons unrelated to the study within the ﬁrst few weeks of the egg-free diet period and were excluded from analyses.An overview of the study ﬂowchart is presented in Figure 1.Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 4 of 24 Table 1.Nutrient composition of daily egg treatment.

Dietary Intake Analysis To assess dietary nutrient and food group composition and compliance to egg treat- ments, participants completed 5-day food and beverage intake records at the end of the ﬁrst egg-free diet period (week 4), and at the end of the egg white and whole egg diet periods (week 8 and week 16). The 5-day diet recording period consisted of 3 weekdays and 2 weekend days.Average daily nutrient composition and intake analysis was deter- mined utilizing the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR, Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapoli s, MN, USA).Compliance to the egg diet treatments was additionally monitored by comp letion of a daily egg intake questionnaire.2.4.Body Composition Analysis Body composition was determined at the end of the ﬁrst egg-free diet period (week 4), and the end of the egg white and whole egg diet periods (week 8 and week 16).
Body weight and composition (% body fat, fat mass, fat-free mass, muscle mass) were deter- mined as described above utilizing a Tanita SC-240 digital scale with bioelectrical imped- ance function. BMI (kg/m2) was calculated following measurement of body height and Figure 1.Diagram of study design and subject recruitment, enrollment, and completion.Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 5 of 24 2.3.Dietary Intake Analysis To assess dietary nutrient and food group composition and compliance to egg treat- ments, participants completed 5-day food and beverage intake records at the end of the ﬁrst egg-free diet period (week 4), and at the end of the egg white and whole egg diet periods (week 8 and week 16).The 5-day diet recording period consisted of 3 weekdays and 2 weekend days.Average daily nutrient composition and intake analysis was determined utilizing the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR, Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
Compliance to the egg diet treatments was additionally monitored by completion of a daily egg intake questionnaire. 2.4.Body Composition Analysis Body composition was determined at the end of the ﬁrst egg-free diet period (week 4), and the end of the egg white and whole egg diet periods (week 8 and week 16).Body weight and composition (% body fat, fat mass, fat-free mass, muscle mass) were determined as described above utilizing a Tanita SC-240 digital scale with bioelectrical impedance function.BMI (kg/m2) was calculated following measurement of body height and weight, with body height determined as described above utilizing a Tanita HR-200 wall-mounted height rod (Tanita Corporation of America, Arlington Heights, IL, USA).2.5.Blood Collection Fasted blood samples were collected after a 12-h overnight fast via venipuncture into EDTA and SST tubes at the end of the ﬁrst egg-free diet period and the end of the whole egg and egg white diet periods.
Serum was isolated by centrifugation at 1200 ×gfor 10 min at 20◦C in an Allegra X-14R swing-bucket centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA ) and aliquoted under sterile conditions for analyses described below. EDTA whole blood was aliquoted for analysis of complete blood cell counts.2.6.Clinical Metabolic Parameters and Measures of Choline Status Clinical metabolic proﬁles were determined in fasting serum.Fasting serum glu- cose and lipids, including total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides, were measured by spectrophotometry by Quest Diagnostics (Seacaucus, NJ, USA).LDL- cholesterol (LDL-C) was determined using the Martin–Hopkins calculation.
Serum elec- trolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium), carbon dioxide, measures of protein status, liver, and kidney function (blood urea nitrogen, serum total protein, albumin, globu- lin, albumin:globulin ratio, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase), and the acute-phase liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were ad- ditionally measured by Quest Diagnostics. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured enzymatically utilizing a Cobas c-111 clinical analyzer (Roche Diagnos- tics, Florham Park, NJ, USA).Serum concentrations of ketones (total ketone bodies, beta- hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone), choline, betaine, and TMAO were measured by LabCorp (Morrisville, NC, USA).2.7.Lipoprotein Size Proﬁles Triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRLP), LDL, and HDL particle proﬁles were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by LabCorp (Morrisville, NC, USA) in serum sam- ples, as previously described [ 10].
Measures included the concentration of total TRLP , LDL, and HDL particles, in addition average TRLP , LDL, and HDL particle diameters (nm). Serum concentrations particle subclasses were additionally reported, including concentra- tions of very large TRLP (90–240 nm), large TRLP (50–89 nm), medium TRLP (37–49 nm), small TRLP (30–36 nm), and very small TRLP (24–29 nm).For LDL, serum concentrations of large LDL (21.5–23 nm), medium LDL (20.5–21.4 nm), and small LDL (19–20.4 nm) were reported.HDL subclasses are reported as the concentrations of total small (7.4–8.0 nm), medium (8.1–9.5 nm), and large (9.6–13 nm) HDL in addition to concentrations of HDL particles of deﬁned sizes: H1P (7.4 nm), H2P (7.8 nm), H3P (8.7 nm), H4P (9.5 nm), H5P Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 6 of 24 (10.3 nm), H6P (10.8 nm), H7P (12.0 nm).Data for TRLP and LDL are reported as nmol/L, whereas data for HDL are reported as µmol/L.
Serum concentrations of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1) were similarly measured by NMR and are reported as mg/dL. 2.8.Serum Amino Acid and Insulin Resistance Measures Serum concentrations of amino acids (total branched-chain amino acids, valine, leucine, isoleucine, alanine, and glycine) were measured by LabCorp using liquid chromatogra- phy/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.Serum glycA—a measure of protein levels and glycosylation states of several of the most abundant acute-phase proteins in serum [ 39]—and citrate were determined by NMR.Data generated from lipoprotein proﬁles and amino acids were additionally used to calculate (1) a lipoprotein–insulin resistance index (LP–IR), and (2) diabetes risk index (DRI), as reported by LabCorp.
LP–IR is calcu- lated from a combination of six lipoprotein parameters, including large very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle number, VLDL size, small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) par- ticle number, LDL size, large high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle number, and HDL size via LabCorp’s proprietary Vantera®platform (Coral Gables, FL, USA). LP–IR values range from 0 (most insulin sensitive) to 100 (most insulin resistant).DRI is calculated from LP–IR plus the concentrations of valine and leucine.DRI values range from 0 (most insulin sensitive) to 100 (most insulin resistant).2.9.Complete Blood Cell Counts Complete blood cell counts were measured in freshly collected EDTA whole blood by Quest Diagnostics by electronic cell sizing/counting/cytometry/microscopy .Data reported include total white blood cell counts and differential absolute and % neutrophils, lympho- cytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.
Additional hematologic parameters reported include total red blood cells, total hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and platelet concentrations. Clinically-relevant immune ratios, including neutrophil:lymphocyte and lymphocyte:monocyte ratios were calcu- lated as follows: neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio = absolute neutrophils ÷absolute lymphocytes; lymphocyte:monocyte ratio = absolute lymphocytes ÷absolute monocytes [40,41].2.10.Statistical Analysis Analysis was performed on data derived from the 26 participants who completed the study unless otherwise noted due to limited sample availability to complete all measures for each participant.Baseline characteristics of participants included in ﬁnal analyses are included in Supplementary Table S1.Samples from participants at each time point were analyzed in the same batches in order to minimize variability across assay runs.
Repeated measures ANOVA with pairwise comparisons was performed using SPSS Version 28 to compare the effects of different egg diets on clinical outcome measures. Independent t-tests were used to compare changes in outcome measures following the egg white vs.whole egg period between COC users (n = 11) vs.non-users (n = 10) in female participants.Bivariate Pearson correlations were performed to evaluate associations between changes in metabolic and hematologic parameters across diet periods.All data are presented as mean ±standard deviation unless otherwise noted.Values with different letters (a, b, c) are signiﬁcantly different, as are comparisons denoted with an asterisk (* p< 0.05).3.Results 3.1.Average Daily Nutrient Intake Differed across Egg Diet Periods Given the differences in the nutrient composition of egg whites and egg yolks, we ﬁrst evaluated whether adherence to the different egg diets impacted average daily nutrient intake of the diet as a whole.
An analysis of ﬁve-day dietary records indicated that an average daily intake of nutrients with known anti-inﬂammatory, antioxidant, metabolic, immunomodulatory, and hematopoietic properties differed across egg diet periods (Table 2). Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 7 of 24 While energy intake remained consistent across diet periods, % macronutrient intake differed, with % carbohydrate and % fat intake decreasing and increasing, respectively, from the egg-free diet to the egg white and whole egg diets.Compared to the egg-free diet, intake of animal protein, polyunsaturated fat, and sodium was increased during the whole egg diet, whereas intake of total fat, monounsaturated fat, arachidonic acid, and cholesterol was increased during the whole egg diet period compared to both the egg-free and egg white diet periods.Consumption of total protein foods and oils on average were increased during the egg white and whole egg diet periods as compared to the whole egg diet period (Table S2).
We additionally assessed the intake of amino acids that serve as serum indicators of insulin resistance, which were not changed over the course of the intervention. In line with egg yolks serving as a rich, bioavailable source of the antioxidant carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin [ 4,6], we observed that, compared to the egg-free diet, the average daily intake of lutein and zeaxanthin was increased during the whole egg diet period.Notably, intake of various micronutrients was also increased in the whole egg diet periods relative to the egg white diet period, including pantothenic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and phosphorus, whereas selenium intake was greater during the whole egg diet period compared to both the egg-free and egg white diet periods.
Finally, given that egg yolks serve as a rich source of choline (provided by glycerophospho- and sphingolipids) [ 11], average dietary intake of choline was increased during the whole egg diet period compared to both the egg-free and egg white diet periods.

Effect of Egg Intake on Body Composition and Clinical Metabolic Proﬁles We next evaluated the effects of egg intake on body composition, measures of protein and choline status, kidney and liver function, and inﬂammation—including the acute-phase liver enzymes ALT, AST, and hsCRP (Table 3). Despite monitoring and dietary guidance to ensure weight maintenance throughout the diet periods, body weight increased by 0.9% on average during the egg white period as compared to the egg-free diet period, although this did not equate to signiﬁcant changes in fat, fat-free, or muscle mass.In contrast, while body weight did not signiﬁcantly differ between the egg-free and whole egg diet period, fat mass was increased by 3.5% on average following the whole egg diet.In assessing metabolic panels, we did not observe differences in markers of protein status, kidney and liver function, inﬂammation, or ketone concentrations across diet periods.
However, we observed signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of serum choline and the choline metabolite betaine following the whole egg period, in line with increased dietary choline intake during this intervention phase. Notably, serum concentrations of TMAO were not altered between egg diet periods.Table 3.Anthropometric and serum metabolic proﬁles following egg diet periods.

While there was notable variability across individuals, changes in fasting total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, triglycerides, or the total cholesterol:HDL-C ratio did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (Figure 2A–F), with no differences observed between male and female participants. Interestingly, in conducting a subgroup analysis of female participants, we observed that variability in serum lipid responses to egg diets may in part be attributable to the use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs).Notably, changes in total cholesterol:HDL- C ratio between the egg white and whole diet periods were signiﬁcantly decreased in COC users as compared to non-users (Figure 2G).This effect appeared to be primarily driven by changes in HDL-C between COC users vs.non-users, although differences did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (Figure 2H).3.4.
Effects of Egg Intake on Lipoprotein Particle Proﬁles Despite observing only minimal effects of egg intake on serum lipids—and only in female participants based on COC use—we further evaluated whether the intake of different egg diets impacted lipoprotein particle proﬁles. Overall, we did not observe changes in average TRLP , LDL, or HDL particle size; serum concentrations of total TRLP , LDL, or HDL particles; apoB or HDL-associated apoA-1; and size subclasses of TRLP , LDL, and total large, medium, and small HDL (Table S3).However, we observed that HDL H6P (10.8 nm)—a subclass of large HDL—was increased following the whole egg diet as compared to the egg-free and egg white diet periods ( p< 0.05; Figure 3A).Similar to differences in total cholesterol:HDL-C in response to egg intake observed between female COC users vs.non-users, we observed a trend toward greater increases in large LDL concentrations following the whole egg diet period in non-users (Figure 3B).3.5.
Effects of Egg Intake on Markers of Insulin Sensitivity We next evaluated the effects of egg intake on fasting glucose and markers of insulin resistance, given that some epidemiological studies have reported associations between egg intake and type 2 diabetes mellitus risk, although these ﬁndings are not consistent across studies [ 15,42–45]. In line with previous intervention studies [ 10,23,46], we did not observe changes in fasting glucose across diet periods (Table 4.Further, we did not observe changes in glycA—a measure of protein levels and glycosylation states of several of the most abundant acute-phase proteins in serum [ 39].Given recent reports that serum amino acid levels have predictive potential in evaluating T2DM risk [ 24,25], we next evaluated whether intake of different egg-based diets altered serum amino acid proﬁles.
Interestingly, we observed that serum isoleucine was increased in the egg white and whole egg diet periods as compared to the egg-free diet period, whereas serum glycine was increased following the whole egg diet only. While serum concentrations of branched- chain aminos are positively correlated with insulin resistance [ 24], glycine, a conditionally essential amino acid, circulates at a lower level in T2DM patients as compared to healthy Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 10 of 24 controls [ 25], suggesting a greater potential protective effect of whole eggs against T2DM as compared to egg whites.Despite these differences, no changes in lipoprotein insulin resistance index ( LP–IR ) or diabetes risk index (DRI)—which take into account lipoprotein proﬁles and serum amino acid concentrations to characterize insulin resistance and T2DM risk [47,48]—were observed across diet periods.Nutrients 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 26 Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation, n = 23–26.

Notably, changes in total choles- terol:HDL-C ratio between the egg white and whole diet periods were signi ﬁcantly de- creased in COC users as compared to non-users (Figure 2G). This e ﬀect appeared to be primarily driven by changes in HDL-C betw een COC users vs.non-users, although dif- ferences did not reach statistical signi ﬁcance (Figure 2H).Figure 2.Serum lipid responses to egg intake are altered in females based on used of combined oral contraceptives.Intake of an egg-free diet (light blue), e gg whites (purple), or whole eggs (dark blue) did not alter serum ( A) total cholesterol, ( B) LDL-C, ( C) non-HDL-C, ( D) triglycerides, ( E) total cho- lesterol:HDL-C ratio, or ( F) HDL-C in young healthy men and wo men (n = 26).In female partici- pants, changes in the total cholesterol:HDL-C ratio ( G) and ( H) HDL-C between the egg white and whole diet periods were evaluated in COC users (teal bar, n = 11) as compared to non-users (gray bar, n = 10).* p < 0.05, NS: non-signi ﬁcant.

Further, we did not ob-serve changes in glycA—a measure of protein levels and glycosylation states of several of the most abundant acute-phase proteins in serum [39]. Given recent reports that serum amino acid levels have predictive potential in evaluating T2DM risk [24,25], we next eval- uated whether intake of di ﬀerent egg-based diets altered serum amino acid pro ﬁles.In- terestingly, we observed that serum isoleuci ne was increased in the egg white and whole egg diet periods as compared to the egg-free diet period, whereas serum glycine was in- creased following the whole egg diet only.While serum concentrations of branched-chain aminos are positively correlated with insulin resistance [24], glycine, a conditionally es- sential amino acid, circulates at a lower level in T2DM patients as compared to healthy controls [25], suggesting a greater potential protective e ﬀect of whole eggs against T2DM as compared to egg whites.
Despite these di ﬀerences, no changes in lipoprotein insulin resistance index (LP–IR) or diabetes risk in dex (DRI)—which take into account lipoprotein proﬁles and serum amino acid concentrations to characterize insulin resistance and T2DM risk [47,48]—were observ ed across diet periods.

Effects of Egg Intake on Clinical Immune Proﬁles Previous studies have reported changes in systemic inﬂammatory markers and periph- eral blood mononuclear cell inﬂammatory responsiveness following egg intake [11,30,49]; however, the effects of egg intake on clinical immune proﬁles are less well-characterized. In this current study, we did not observe statistically signiﬁcant changes in total white blood cell or differential leukocyte counts between egg diet periods, nor did we observe changes in the percent distribution of leukocyte subsets, although notable variability in responses was observed (Table S4).We further evaluated the effects of egg intake on clinical leuko- cyte ratios that have prognostic potential in chronic inﬂammatory conditions, including neutrophil:lymphocyte and lymphocyte:monocyte ratios [ 40,50,51]; however, these metrics did not change over the course of the intervention.
Given that serum lipid responses to diet differed in female participants with COC use, we further evaluated whether COC use dictated the effects of egg intake on clinical immune markers. While changes in total WBC and neutrophil counts between the egg white and whole egg diet periods with COC use did not reach statistical signiﬁcance, we observed that changes in % monocytes between egg white and whole egg periods were signiﬁcantly reduced in COC users as compared to non-users (Figure 4).Nutrients 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 26 Leucine, µmol/L 123.4 ± 20.0 120.9 ± 24.8 126.4 ± 19.0 0.612 Isoleucine, µmol/L 50.4 ± 10.6 a 56.9 ± 9.5 b 58.4 ± 11.1 b 0.001 Valine, µmol/L 188.0 ± 28.5 198.3 ± 31.5 199.2 ± 30.6 0.133 Alanine, µmol/L 363.4 ± 98.0 365.5 ± 83.0 378.7 ± 65.9 0.608 Glycine, µmol/L 202.9 ± 53.2 a 196.0 ± 47.7 a 219.2 ± 61.2 b 0.004 Citrate, µmol/L 86.0 ± 24.4 87.6 ± 24.9 81.3 ± 19.2 0.408 Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation, n = 25–26.

We further evaluated the e ﬀects of egg intake on clinical leukocyte ratios that have prognostic potential in chronic in ﬂammatory condi- tions, including neutrophil:lymphocyte and lymphocyte:monocyte ra tios [40,50,51]; how- ever, these metrics did not change over the course of the intervention. Given that serum lipid responses to diet di ﬀered in female participants with COC use, we further evaluated whether COC use dictated the e ﬀects of egg intake on clinical immune markers.While changes in total WBC and neutrophil counts between the egg white and whole egg diet periods with COC use did not reach statistical signi ﬁcance, we observed that changes in % monocytes between egg white and whole egg periods were signi ﬁcantly reduced in COC users as compared to non-users (Figure 4).Figure 4.Eﬀects of egg intake on clinical immune pro ﬁles with COC use.

Effects of Egg Intake on Clinical Erythrocyte and Platelet Proﬁles In addition to evaluating the effects of egg intake on immune profiles, we further assessed whether intake of different egg-based diets altered erythrocyte markers—particularly given the changes in reported dietary intake of hematopoietic nutrients throughout the intervention. Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 12 of 24 While changes in total red blood cell counts did not reach statistical significance, hemat- ocrit increased following the whole egg diet as compared to the egg-free diet (Figure 5A,C).Conversely , no changes in hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, or mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations were observed between diet periods (Figure 5B,D,E).Interest- ingly, platelets decreased following both the egg white and whole egg diet period as compared to the egg-free diet period (Figure 5F).
The effects of egg intake on erythrocyte and platelet measures did not differ in female participants with COC use—despite previous reports that COC use has been associated with higher hemoglobin and red blood cell and platelet counts [37]. 3.8.Egg-Induced Changes in Lipoprotein and Glucose Sensitivity Measures Differentially Correlate with Changes in Immune Cell Subset Counts Beyond the potential direct role of egg-derived nutrients on metabolic and hematologic outcome measures, we hypothesized that variable changes in immune and erythrocyte parameters across participants may additionally be a result of improved metabolic proﬁles— speciﬁcally the changes in the concentration of large HDL particles, as HDL has been shown to inﬂuence immune cell activation, differentiation, and erythrocyte lifespan [ 52–55].
In conducting statistical correlation analysis, we found that changes in speciﬁc serum lipid and lipoprotein subclasses differentially correlated with changes in total white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts between egg white and whole egg diet periods (Figure 6). Notably, the greatest number of correlations were observed between HDL and immune measures, as compared to other serum lipid and lipoprotein fractions.Overall, changes in HDL measures negatively correlated with immune cell counts with the exception of medium HDL and with changes in the concentration of total HDL particles having the strongest overall relationship across immune cell types.Further, changes in fasting serum triglycerides, very large TRLP , glucose, and LP–IR were positively correlated with changes in different immune cell counts.Nutrients 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 26 mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations were observed between diet periods (Fig- ure 5B,D,E).
Interestingly, platelets decrease d following both the egg white and whole egg diet period as compared to the egg-free diet period (Figure 5F). The e ﬀects of egg intake on erythrocyte and platelet measures did not di ﬀer in female participants with COC use— despite previous reports that COC use has be en associated with higher hemoglobin and red blood cell and platelet counts [37].Figure 5.Eﬀects of egg intake on clinical erythrocyte and platelet pro ﬁles.Intake of an egg-free diet (light blue), egg whites (purple) , or whole eggs (dark blue) on ( A) total red blood cells; ( B) hemo- globin; ( C) hematocrit; ( D) mean corpuscular volume; ( E) mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentra- tions; and ( F) total platelets (n = 23).Di ﬀerent letters (a, b) denote statistically signi ﬁcant compari- sons.* p < 0.05, NS: non-signi ﬁcant.3.8.
Egg-Induced Changes in Lipoprotein and Glucose Sensitivity Measures Di ﬀerentially Correlate with Changes in Immune Cell Subset Counts Beyond the potential direct role of egg- derived nutrients on metabolic and hemato- logic outcome measures, we hypothesized that variable changes in immune and erythro- cyte parameters across participants may additionally be a result of improved metabolic proﬁles—speci ﬁcally the changes in the concentration of large HDL particles, as HDL has been shown to in ﬂuence immune cell activation, di ﬀerentiation, and erythrocyte lifespan [52–55]. In conducting statistical correlation analysis, we found that changes in speci ﬁc serum lipid and lipoprotein subclasses di ﬀerentially correlated with changes in total white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts between egg white and whole egg diet periods (Figure 6).

Discussion Eggs are a rich source of bioactive nutrients and dietary compounds that possess prop- erties that may contribute to the regulation of metabolic health, lipid metabolism, immune function, and hematopoiesis [ 1–3]. However, the effects of egg intake on biomarkers related to these health parameters are often inconsistent and evaluated in isolation, making it difﬁcult to evaluate the comprehensive effects of egg intake on standard, routine clinical parameters that are more likely to inﬂuence a healthcare provider’s dietary recommenda- tions [ 1,45].In this study, we observed that intake of an egg-free diet, 3 egg whites per day, and 3 whole eggs per day altered the global dietary nutrient composition, with whole eggs leading to greater overall improvements in micronutrient diet quality.
Further, whole egg consumption improved choline status and HDL, immune, and hematologic proﬁles while minimally—yet potentially less adversely—affecting markers of insulin resistance as compared to egg whites. Importantly, the use of COC by female participants altered the serum lipid and immune responses to egg diets, and correlation analysis suggests that egg- induced changes in HDL and insulin resistance markers correlated with changes in immune parameters while correlations between other metabolic and hematologic markers were not observed.Together, these ﬁndings suggest that, despite increases in body fat mass and certain nutrients associated with chronic disease pathophysiology [ 56,57], whole egg intake may confer greater global metabolic and hematologic beneﬁts compared to egg-free and egg white diets, although effects may differ based on the use of hormone- based medication.
Despite being a relatively rich dietary source of cholesterol, whole egg consumption has been positively associated with greater overall diet quality, including greater daily intake of high-quality protein, polyunsaturated and monosaturated fat, α-linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), vitamin D, potassium, phosphorus, selenium, choline, and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin—the majority of which are provided by the egg yolk [ 2,4,8,58]. Similar dietary patterns were observed in our study, with greater enrichment of many of these nutrients during the whole egg period.Beyond the intake of egg yolk nutrients, egg consumers tend to incorporate more total protein foods, seafoods, total vegetables, whole fruits, whole grains, and dairy foods, leading to healthier whole food patterns [ 8,58].
Besides the beneﬁt of greater diet quality, egg consumers reported higher Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 14 of 24 postprandial satiety and suppressed ghrelin responses [ 23,59,60] as well as decreased intake of total and added sugar compared to non-egg consumers [ 58,61]. These ﬁndings are in line with the results from our study, in which the percent of kilocalories coming from carbohydrates was reduced in the whole egg diet period as compared to the egg-free and egg white diet periods while total energy intake across diet periods did not differ.It is important to note that the intake of various nutrients associated with cardiometabolic disease were increased by whole egg intake, including total fat, arachidonic acid, and sodium [ 56,57,62].However, a greater intake of these nutrients did not correspond to adverse changes in cardiometabolic or hematologic proﬁles—despite minor changes in body composition.
Reports on the effects of egg intake on body weight and composition yield conﬂicting results from epidemiological and intervention studies. In a cross-sectional study by Garrido- Miguel et al.[ 26], consumption of ≥5 eggs/week was associated with lower BMI and body fat percentage compared to participants consuming <1 egg/week in a young adult population (age 18–30 years old), suggesting that greater egg consumption may promote a healthier body composition, which is in line with studies ﬁnding that eggs increase satiety and improve diet quality [ 8,23,58–60].Interestingly, reductions of body weight following dried whole egg intake has also been observed in diabetic and diet-induced obesity rat models [ 63,64].
Population-based and observational studies have also reported conﬂicting sex-speciﬁc differences in the effects of egg intake on body composition, with consumption of >50 g egg/day being associated with reduced risk of central obesity and body fat in females only in a study of 2241 Chinese adults (age 18–80 y) [ 65], whereas stronger protective associations between egg intake and reduced risk of being classiﬁed as metabolically unhealthily obese were observed in males [ 66]. In contrast, Shim and Seo [ 27] observed that an intake of 2–3 eggs/week and 4–6 eggs/week based on food frequency questionnaire responses were associated with higher body fat mass in males and females, respectively, in 13,366 adults from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2008–2011.
Variability in results across studies may be attributable to differences in study population characteristics (including age, sex, and health status), background dietary patterns, methods for assessing diet and body composition, and criteria for classifying high vs. low egg intake.Further, these results often do not translate to those observed in randomized, controlled intervention studies, in which an intake of 1–3 eggs/day has not been associated with changes in body weight or composition in healthy adults [ 19].In our study, we observed a 0.9% increase in body weight and a 3.5% increase in fat mass in the egg white and whole egg diet period, respectively, as compared to the egg-free diet period, with no differences between males and females.
However, it is unclear if these results are physiologically signiﬁcant given a lack and/or improvement in metabolic proﬁles from whole egg intake, or whether these changes are artifacts or coincidental natural ﬂuctuations in weight that would persist long-term. Additional intervention studies are warranted to elucidate whether certain dietary patterns or metabolic proﬁles are determinants of body composition change from egg intake.In line with increased dietary choline intake observed during the whole egg pe- riod, serum concentrations of choline and the choline metabolite betaine were higher following the whole egg diet period, which is consistent with previous egg intervention studies [49,67].
Egg yolks serve as a rich source of choline (~125 mg per large egg), which is an essential component of cell membrane phospholipids, a precursor to the neurotrans- mitter acetylcholine; regulates one-carbon metabolism and homocysteine levels through the formation of betaine; and supports neural tube and brain development and cognitive function in early life [ 2,4,68]. Betaine has also been shown to possess anti-inﬂammatory activities through inhibition of nuclear factor- κB activity, NLRP3 inﬂammasome activa- tion, and mitigation of endoplasmic reticulum stress [ 69].Further, choline provided by egg yolk has been shown to be more bioavailable and efﬁciently absorbed compared to a choline bitartrate supplemented beverage [ 68].Incorporating bioavailable sources of choline into the diet is essential, as choline intake by pregnant women, children, and adult Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 15 of 24 men and women often fall far below Adequate Intake (AI) levels [ 70].
Through the analysis of >25,000 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2014 datasets, Wallace and Fulgoni [ 71] reported that egg consumers were found to have a higher intake of choline compared to non-egg consumers and concluded that the ability of individ- uals to meet the AI for choline is extremely difﬁcult unless they consume eggs or a dietary supplement that provides choline. With the AI for men and women age 19+ being 550 mg and 425 mg/day, respectively [ 72], our study participants only met the daily AI for choline during the whole egg diet period on average (614.1 mg/day), whereas the average daily intake of choline during the egg-free (289.5 mg/day) and egg white ( 221.2 mg/day ) diet periods fell below the AI.Importantly, we did not observe changes in serum TMAO—a proatherogenic choline metabolite produced by intestinal microbiota, which early studies linked to be increased by egg intake [ 18,73].
However, numerous intervention studies have since demonstrated that the intake of up to three whole eggs/day does not increase plasma TMAO in young healthy subjects [ 19,74,75], overweight postmenopausal women [ 67], or subjects with metabolic syndrome [ 76], which is consistent with our observations. Together, these ﬁndings suggest that whole intake supports improvements in choline status without adversely impacting choline-derived CVD risk factors.The lack of effect of our study intervention on serum lipids and apoB-containing lipoprotein size proﬁles similarly suggests that cardiovascular disease biomarkers and risk are not adversely impacted by whole egg intake [ 77,78].In contrast, the increase in HDL H6P—a subclass of large HDL—following the whole egg period is indicative of reduced CVD risk in population-based studies [ 3,79,80].
These ﬁndings are consistent with egg intervention studies conducted in young and older healthy adults as well as adults classiﬁed as overweight, with metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes, with many studies additionally reporting increases in HDL-C [ 10,19,46,81–83]. The effects of whole egg intake on HDL parameters may in part be attributable to yolk-derived phospholipids, given that dietary phospholipid feeding has been shown to increase HDL-C in human and animal studies and that dietary phosphatidylcholine—the predominant phospholipid egg yolk—is preferentially incorporated into HDL particles following ingestion [ 84].Egg intake has additionally been shown to increase lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity, which facilitates the esteriﬁcation of free cholesterol to cholesteryl esters and promotes HDL maturation, stabilization, and increased particle size [ 10,19].
More recent studies have indicated diverse functions depending on HDL particle size; for instance, large particles have shown stronger antioxidant function [ 85,86] and were positively associated with HDL efﬂux capacity in 402 participants from the Chicago Healthy Aging Study [ 87]. Further re- search is warranted to evaluate the mechanisms by which egg intake modulates serum lipid and HDL proﬁles across individuals with varied and seemingly similar health phenotypes.To explore potential factors that could inﬂuence the serum lipoprotein response to egg intake, we evaluated differences in serum lipid and lipoprotein proﬁle changes in female subjects who were taking COCs vs.those who were not.Previous studies have shown mostly negative associations between COC use and serum lipid proﬁles; more speciﬁcally, various studies have shown that COC use is associated with signiﬁcant increases in TC, LDL-C, and a reduction in HDL-C and the HDL-C/LDL-C ratio [ 34–36].
While COC use alters blood lipids, Momeni et al. [ 88] reported neutral effects on plasma levels of homocysteine and nitric oxide plasma levels in healthy young women.In our study, we observed greater increases in total cholesterol:HDL-C ratios in female subjects not using COCs as compared to COC users as well as trends toward decreases in HDL-C and increases in large LDL concentrations.In epidemiological studies, a shift from large LDL to greater concentrations of medium and small LDL particles has been associated with increased risk of CVD and coronary heart disease [ 89].While these changes observed in our study did not reach statistical signiﬁcance, it highlights an important consideration for conducting dietary intervention studies, particularly given that 19.5% of women age 15–19, 21.6% of women age 20–29, and 10.9% of women age 30–39 use COC [ 90].
Further research is warranted Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 16 of 24 to determine whether COC and other hormone-based therapies inﬂuence physiological response to diet in intervention settings. In addition to evaluating traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, we evaluated the effects of egg intake on standard and emerging clinical biomarkers of insulin resistance.Epidemiological studies have reported conﬂicting results on the association between egg intake, markers of glucose control, and type 2 diabetes risk, with some studies reporting that higher daily intake of eggs is positively associated with higher blood glucose and greater risk of type 2 diabetes [ 15,91], whereas others have found that egg consumption is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged and old men in Korea [ 22].
In intervention trials, whole egg intake has not been shown to have neutral or beneﬁcial effects on fasting glucose levels or insulin resistance markers (e.g., plasma insulin, HOMA-IR) in young healthy adults, subjects with metabolic syndrome, or type 2 diabetes [ 10,19,23,46]. Similarly, we did not observe changes in fasting glucose across egg diets in our study, nor did we observe changes in glycA—a measure of protein levels and glycosylation states of several of the most abundant acute-phase proteins in serum [ 39].Interestingly, however, we observed that serum isoleucine was elevated in the egg white and whole egg diet periods as compared to the egg-free diet period, whereas serum glycine was elevated only following the whole egg diet.Reduced gene expression involved in branched- chain amino acid metabolism is one of the characteristics of type 2 diabetes [ 92]; thus, serum concentrations of branched-chain aminos are positively correlated with insulin resistance [ 24,25].
In contrast, serum glycine was found to be low in patients with obesity and diabetes [ 93,94], and an improvement of diabetes is positively associated with higher serum glycine level [ 95]. Our ﬁndings suggest that, perhaps, components of egg whites may be contributing to the positive associations between egg intake and insulin resistance, whereas components of egg yolk may counteract or balance these effects.A potential mechanism by which egg yolks can increase glycine concentrations is through the provision of choline, which is metabolized to betaine (or trimethylglycine) and ultimately glycine [ 25], which would correspond to our observations that serum choline and betaine were increased by whole egg intake.We further evaluated the effects of egg intake on clinical immune proﬁles, for which there are limited studies, and serum inﬂammatory markers, for which studies have re- ported conﬂicting results [ 1,96].
In healthy individuals, whole egg intake has variable effects in serum inﬂammatory markers, including serum amyloid A and hsCRP , with stud- ies reporting both pro-inﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory effects of egg intake [11,97–99]. However, reduction in plasma inﬂammatory markers from whole egg intake is more commonly observed in populations characterized by metabolic dysfunction and chronic low-grade inﬂammation (e.g., metabolic syndrome, overweight) [ 11,49,98].While yolks pro- vide a variety of nutrients with anti-inﬂammatory properties, a study by Dibella et al.[ 49] demonstrated that whole egg intake and choline bitartrate supplementation both decreased IL-6, whereas only whole eggs reduced hsCRP , suggesting that the choline content of whole eggs is in part attributable to their anti-inﬂammatory effects.
Despite increasing serum concentrations of choline, whole egg intake did not signiﬁcantly alter hsCRP , ALT, or AST in our study population, suggesting that further research is needed to identify participant characteristics or other determinants of the variable inﬂammatory responses to egg intake. In addition to serum inﬂammatory markers, total white blood cell counts and differen- tial immune subset counts can serve as important indicators of immune activation, function, and competence within the context of pathogen defense, infection, cancer, and autoimmu- nity [ 100–102].Studies have shown that various clinical leukocyte parameters, including total white blood cells counts, absolute neutrophils and monocytes, and the ratio of neu- trophils:lymphocytes and lymphocytes:monocytes are indicators of systemic inﬂammation and are positively associated with chronic metabolic diseases, such as metabolic syndrome and CVD [ 102–104].
In preclinical studies, whole egg and its lipid constituents have been shown to improve humoral immune status and restore T cell responsiveness, highlighting a potential modulatory role of egg intake in pathogen defense and clearance [ 32,33]. In clini- Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 17 of 24 cal trials, egg intake has additionally been shown to reduce anti-inﬂammatory T regulatory and pro-inﬂammatory Th17 T cell counts, alter cytokine secretion from LPS-stimulated pe- ripheral blood mononuclear cells, and improve clearance of active pulmonary tuberculosis from sputum cultures as part of a cholesterol-rich diet [ 30,31,99].Consistent with the lack of effect on serum inﬂammatory markers, we did not observe changes in clinical immune parameters across diet periods in the study population as a whole, although whether our intervention induced changes in speciﬁc leukocyte subsets (e.g., Treg vs.
Th17) and inﬂam- matory responsiveness to stimuli that cannot be detected by measurement of traditional, clinical immune proﬁling warrants further study. Notably, in categorizing female subjects by COC use, we observed greater increases in % monocytes from the egg-free to egg white diet periods as compared to changes in % monocytes from the egg-free to whole egg diet periods, whereas changes in total WBC, absolute neutrophils, or other inﬂammatory markers did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.Previous studies have shown that COC use is associated with an increase in inﬂammatory blood biomarkers including CRP , MCP-1, and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-6 [ 105,106].More recently, a 2022 review by Tekle et al.[ 37] highlighted that, compared to non-users, COC users did not have signiﬁcantly altered leukocyte counts across multiple studies.However, this review was a narrative review and, therefore, did not show the pooled effect of oral contraceptives on these parameters.
While higher absolute monocyte counts have been associated with increased CVD risk [ 107], the clinical signiﬁcance of changes in % monocytes is unclear. A limitation of our COC subgroup analyses is the small sample size; therefore, further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of COC use on diet-mediated changes in immune and inﬂammatory parameters.Interestingly, we additionally observed correlations between changes in clinical im- mune cell subset counts and metabolic parameters, with the majority of associations observed with HDL parameters.We have previously demonstrated that HDL-C predicts clinical immune cell counts, where increases in HDL-C were associated with lower lympho- cyte and monocyte counts in men and women, as well as lower neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil counts in men [ 100].
These ﬁndings are consistent with our data, where changes in HDL-C, total HDL particles, and large and small HDL particle subsets negatively corre- lated with changes in clinical immune counts. HDL is an important modulator of immune cell activity, through modulation of lipid rafts and subsequent inﬂammation and cellular expansion in response to stimuli, carrying proteins with immunomodulatory properties, and by inﬂuencing cellular energy metabolism [ 53,108–111].Accordingly, HDL proﬁles and its proteomic composition are modiﬁed and show therapeutic potential in acute and chronic inﬂammatory conditions such as CVD, autoimmune disorders, COVID-19, and sepsis [ 109,112].Thus, further characterization of the immunomodulatory properties of HDL in response to egg intake is warranted.
Conversely, we observed positive correla- tions between changes in clinical immune cell counts and metabolic parameters associated with chronic inﬂammatory disease risk, including serum triglycerides, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, glucose, and LP–IR, suggesting that individuals who experienced increases in these metabolic parameters following whole egg intake were more likely to reﬂect immune proﬁles indicative of greater immune inﬂammation. In addition to clinical leukocyte proﬁles, we examined the effects of egg intake on (1) erythrocyte markers, which serve as important indicators of anemia, inﬂammation, and nutritional status, and (2) platelets, which are essential for blood clotting and can serve as a marker of inﬂammation, as well as predictors of CVD and cancer risk [ 113–115].
Eggs contain various nutrients that support hematopoiesis and red blood cell proﬁles, including protein; vitamins A, D, and E; B vitamins; iron; calcium; manganese; magnesium; sodium and potassium; iodine; phosphorus; selenium; copper; zinc; and choline—many of which are contained in the egg yolk [ 4,5,116,117], which could explain the increase in hematocrit levels observed following the whole egg diet period. However, the effects of egg consumption on erythrocyte proﬁles and iron status—the most common nutritional cause of anemia and routine clinical indicators of red blood cell health [ 118]—remains Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3747 18 of 24 somewhat controversial.Negative effects of egg intake on erythrocyte and iron status markers have been in part attributed to decreased iron bioavailability and limited effects on ferritin, which is responsible for iron-storage [ 118–120].
The effects of egg intake on iron status may be dependent on the fraction of eggs consumed, as yolk iron is predominantly contained within phosvitin, which is relatively resistant to digestion, thereby decreasing iron bioavailability [ 121,122], whereas iron contained within egg white-derived ovalbumin may promote non-heme iron absorption [ 122]. Egg consumption (whole or powdered) has been associated with reduced iron absorption—estimated by Hallberg and Hulthen to be ~27% for 3 eggs consumed [ 119], using an algorithm developed from observations from early feeding studies.While Leonard et al.[ 123] found that egg intake was weakly associated with lower serum ferritin (Spearman’s r = −0.28) in a cross-sectional study of 107 Australian women, additional recent studies have found no detrimental relationship between egg intake and iron status [124,125].Six months of daily egg intake similarly did not alter iron or anemia status in young Malawian children [ 126].
In contrast, Little et al. [ 16] found that egg consumption was signiﬁcantly correlated with reduced possibilities of mild anemia compared to subjects with no anemia, but no correlations were found in moderate and severe anemia subjects.For studies reporting improvements in erythrocyte proﬁles and iron status from whole egg intake such as ours, it is important to consider the role of choline given that serum choline levels were increased following the whole egg diet and choline deﬁciency in animals is associated with anemia [ 127].Choline is also found to induce changes on red blood cell membrane properties, such as increasing membrane lipid ﬂuidity [ 128], which might indirectly inﬂuence erythrocyte proﬁles.Further research is warranted to determine whether individual variability, overall nutritional quality of the diet, or nutrient composition/size of egg yolk and egg white fractions underlies the variable effects of egg intake on erythrocyte proﬁles.
We additionally observed a reduction in platelet counts following the egg white and whole egg period compared to the egg-free period. Various nutrients and dietary patterns additionally inﬂuence platelet parameters, where Mediterranean-style, plant-based, and omega-3- and antioxidant polyphenol-rich diet patterns and foods are associated with platelet marker beneﬁts [ 129].Interestingly, in a cohort study of 21,252 adults ( ≥20 years) from the Danish General Suburban Population Study (GESUS), Vinholt et al.
[ 115] reported a U-shaped curve between mortality and platelet counts, with higher platelet counts within the normal range (100–450 ×109/L) being associated with an increased risk of cardiovascu- lar disease and increased risk of mortality with platelet counts over >300 ×109/L.While average and individual platelet counts were within the normal range following each diet period, the reduction of platelet counts following the egg white and whole egg period rela- tive to the egg white period—including participants with platelet counts >300 ×109/L—is perhaps indicative of improved chronic disease risk [115]. 5.Conclusions In summary, we evaluated the effects of consuming different egg-based diets on comprehensive clinical parameters.
Overall, the intake of whole eggs improved the nutrient density of the diet in various aspects while additionally improving choline status, HDL proﬁles, blood amino acid proﬁles indicative of T2DM risk (relative to egg white intake), hematocrit, and platelet counts. Our study additionally highlights unique lipid and immune responses to egg diets in females based on use of COC—a factor that is important to consider in diet intervention trials.Importantly, we observed strong associations between egg diet-induced changes in immune and HDL proﬁles, which warrant further investigation.Together, these ﬁndings suggest that, in a young healthy population, whole egg intake confers mostly beneﬁcial changes in global clinical proﬁles.Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.
