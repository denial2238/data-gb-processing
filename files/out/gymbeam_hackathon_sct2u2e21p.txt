We obtained serum samples from 14 patients with osteoporosis, both at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with teriparatide (n= 10) or denosumab ( n= 4).Samples were analyzed by nanoliquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry on a QTOF 5600 (SCIEX) apparatus.The spectrometry data were analyzed with Mascot against the UniProtKB base and then several quality-control ﬁlters were applied for the identiﬁcation of peptides (false discovery rate, FDR q < 0.02) and their quantiﬁcation (FDR q < 0.05).In the group treated with teriparatide, 28 proteins were identiﬁed with signiﬁcant differences before and after treatment.
A pathway analysis by using the Reactome database revealed signiﬁcant enrichment in the Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-I) (FDR q 4 ×10−2) and innate immune system (FDR q 2 ×10−3) pathways. Among patients treated with denosumab, we observed signiﬁcant differences in the levels of 10 proteins, which were also enriched in the pathways related to the innate immune system (FDR q 3 ×10−2).These results suggest that the innate immune system may be involved in the response to antiosteoporosis drugs.Keywords: proteome; osteoporosis; bone; antiresorptive drugs; teriparatide 1.Introduction Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass and increased susceptibility to fracture.The disease is caused by an imbalance in bone remodeling, with an exaggerated bone resorption and/or an insufﬁcient bone formation, that result in reduced bone mineral density (BMD); microarchitectural damage of bone tissue and decreased skeletal strength.
Thus, drugs used to prevent or treat osteoporosis are classiﬁed according to their mechanism of action, as either antiresorptive or anabolic. Among an- tiresorptive drugs, bisphosphonates and denosumab are the most widely used in clinical practice; whereas molecules structurally related to parathormone (PTH), such as teri- paratide and abaloparatide, are anabolic (i.e., bone-forming) agents frequently used to treat osteoporosis [1,2].Osteoclasts and osteoblasts are the main cells responsible for bone resorption and bone formation, respectively.Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks Receptor Activator for Nuclear Factor κB Ligand (RANKL), an important driver of osteoclast differentiation.Anabolic drugs stimulate osteoblast differentiation, but the mechanism of action is incompletely known.Metabolites 2022 ,12, 399.

Some markers [such as, Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) or C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX)] reﬂect bone resorption, whereas others [such as alkaline phosphatase or Procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP)] reﬂect bone formation.Those markers are either products of bone cells (alkaline phosphatase, TRAP , P1NP) or result from the degradation of bone matrix during bone resorption (CTX).In keeping with this, therapy with anabolic or antiresorptive drugs induce changes in the serum levels of BTM, as predicted by their mechanism of action [ 3].However, very few studies have comprehensively explored the association of serum proteome patterns with osteoporosis or the response to antiosteoporotic drugs [ 4,5].
Therefore, we planned this proof-of-concept exploratory study with the aim of analyzing the impact of drug therapy on serum peptides using a hypothesis-free approach. 2.Results 2.1.Teriparatide Among the 10 paired serum samples, before and after treatment with teriparatide, a total of 621 proteins were identiﬁed.After excluding overwhelming proteins, such as keratins and apolipoproteins, 28 proteins showed statistically signiﬁcant differences when baseline and post-therapy levels were compared (Figure 1).Metabolites 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 11 Changes in bone remodeling are mirrored by changes in the serum levels of several biochemical bone turnover markers (BTM).Some markers [such as, Tartrate -resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) or C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX )] reflect bone re- sorption, whereas others [such as alkaline phosphatase or Procollagen type I N -terminal propeptid e (P1NP )] reflect bone formation.

Analysis of Individual Proteins From each group of treatment, two markers were chosen to replicate F2 and S 100A7 for the group treated with teriparatide ( n = 10); and for the denosumab group ( n = 4) C4 and CFH. A high interindividual variability was obtained in these analyses and no signif- icant changes were observed in any of the markers (Figure 7).Figure 7.Serum levels of individual proteins in patients treated with teriparatide ( above ) or deno- sumab ( below ).p-values correspond to paired t-test analyses.3.Discussion The results of this study suggest that drugs used to treat osteoporosis may impact the immune system, with changes that could be just epiphenomena without biological consequences or perhaps are involved in mediating drug effects.A variety of studies in the last two decades have revealed the complex interactions between the immune system and the skeleton that had been encompassed under the term “osteoimmunology” [6].
Thus, cytokines and other products of immune cells influence bone cells [7,8], and the individual variation in immune responses has been associated with the risk of osteoporosis -related fractures [9]. In turn, osteoblasts and other skeletal cells play a critical role in maintaining “niches” suitable for the development of immune and hematopoietic cells [10,11].Additionally, several tantalizing preclinical experiments in recent ye ars suggest that gut microbiota may also impact the immune system and skel- etal homeostasis, thus building a multilayer network of relationships between microbiota, immune cells , and skeletal cells [12 –14].The mechanisms explaining the anabolic effect of P TH (and the related molecules teriparatide and abaloparatide) are incompletely understood, but they likely involve mul- tiple pathways.
Preclinical data suggest that the osteoanabolic actions of PTH are due to directs effects on cells of the osteoblast linea ge and to indirect effects mediated by stimu- lating IGF -I synthesis and suppressing the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin [15]. Not only bone cells, but also some cells of the immune system, such as several T cell populations and macrophages, express PTH receptors.Teriparatide induces an expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in humans and mice and these cells seem to participate in the anabolic effect of PTH in murine models of osteoporosis [16].On the other hand, in line with the role of Figure 7.Serum levels of individual proteins in patients treated with teriparatide ( above ) or deno- sumab ( below ).p-values correspond to paired t-test analyses.3.

Additionally, several tantalizing preclinical experiments in recent years suggest that gut microbiota may also impact the immune system and skeletal homeostasis, thus building a multilayer network of relationships between microbiota, immune cells, and skeletal cells [12–14]. The mechanisms explaining the anabolic effect of PTH (and the related molecules teriparatide and abaloparatide) are incompletely understood, but they likely involve mul- tiple pathways.Preclinical data suggest that the osteoanabolic actions of PTH are due to Metabolites 2022 ,12, 399 8 of 11 directs effects on cells of the osteoblast lineage and to indirect effects mediated by stim- ulating IGF-I synthesis and suppressing the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin [ 15].Not only bone cells, but also some cells of the immune system, such as several T cell populations and macrophages, express PTH receptors.
Teriparatide induces an expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in humans and mice and these cells seem to participate in the anabolic effect of PTH in murine models of osteoporosis [ 16]. On the other hand, in line with the role of the microbiota–immune axis, experiments showing that gut microbiota is involved in the anabolic response to PTH are particularly intriguing [ 17,18].Thus, although the actual effect of endogenous PTH and exogenous teriparatide and other PTH-related molecules on immune function is still unclear, those experimental data and the results of the present study support a role of immune cells in the skeletal effects of bone anabolic drugs.Denosumab is a RANKL-neutralizing antibody.RANKL binds its receptor RANK, expressed in osteoclast precursors, thus inducing their differentiation into mature bone- resorbing osteoclasts [ 19].Hence, denosumab causes a marked inhibition in bone resorption, increases BMD, and reduces fracture risk [ 20,21].
Besides its role in osteoclast differentiation, RANKL is a costimulatory molecule involved in immune responses. However, unlike its critical role in osteoclast differentiation, RANKL does not seem to be essential for immune responses.In fact, infections and other immune-system-related adverse effects are very rare among denosumab-treated patients [ 22].Nevertheless, this proteomic analysis also pointed out some immune-system-related proteins as impacted by denosumab therapy, a result that merits further investigation.This study has several limitations.First, the sample size was rather small, partic- ularly in the denosumab group.Additionally, although signiﬁcant, the fold changes of differentially expressed proteins were small and their biological relevance has not been elucidated yet.We tried to measure serum levels of some proteins by immunoassay, but the results showed large interindividual dispersion and we were unable to conﬁrm the differences in protein expression.
Therefore, these results should be considered exploratory and require conﬁrmation in larger series of patients and by using different protein-speciﬁc analyses. In this regard, techniques such as proximity extension analysis, may combine high throughput with high speciﬁcity.Additionally, speciﬁc analysis of immune mediators is needed to further delineate the pathways targeted by anabolic and antiresorptive agents.It would also be interesting to analyze serum protein changes at different time points, and explore the correlation, if any, between changes in these new markers and drug response, as evaluated by changes in DXA or in BTM levels.4.Materials and Methods Sample collection and preparation: Blood samples from 14 women with osteoporosis were obtained at baseline and 6 months after initiating therapy with either teriparatide (Forsteor, Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA, 20 µg/day, n= 10) or denosumab (Proliar60 mg, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA, n= 4) (Table 5).
Patients with secondary osteoporosis were excluded. After centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 ×g, serum aliquots were frozen until analysis.The study was approved by the institutional review board and all patients gave informed written consent.Spin-columns High Select HSA/IG Depletion (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) were used to deplete albumin and IgG proteins, which are the major proteins in serum samples.Then, a digestion buffer (7 M Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 100 mM TEAB and 5% SDS) was used to denaturate the proteins and quantify by the PIERCE method at 660 nm.In addition, protein digestion with the S-Trap columns (Protiﬁ, Farmingdale, NY, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions.Digestions are quantiﬁed by ﬂuorimetry (Qubit) to use a total of 1µg per sample.Metabolites 2022 ,12, 399 9 of 11 Table 5.Patients characteristics.

The analytical column used was a silica- based reverse-phase Acquity UPLC M-Class Peptide BEH C18 Column, 75µm×150 mm , 1.7µm particle size and 130 Å pore size (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The trap column was a C18 Acclaim PepMapTM 100 (Thermo Scientiﬁc), 100 µm×2 cm, 5 µm particle diameter, 100 Å pore size, switched online with the analytical column.The loading pump delivered a solution of 0.1% formic acid in water at 2 µL/min.The nano-pump provided a ﬂow rate of 250 nL/min and was operated under gradient elution conditions.Peptides were separated using a 250-minute gradient ranging from 2 to 90% mobile phase B (mobile phase A: 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; mobile phase B: 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid).Injection volume was 5 µL.Data acquisition was performed with a triple-TOF 5600 System (SCIEX, Foster City, CA, USA).
Data was acquired using an ionspray voltage ﬂoating (ISVF) 2300 V , curtain gas (CUR) 35, interface heater temperature (IHT) 150, ion source gas 1 (GS1) 25, declustering potential (DP) 100 V . All data was acquired using information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode with Analyst TF 1.7 software (SCIEX, USA).For IDA parameters, 0.25 s MS survey scan in the mass range of 350–1250 Da were followed by 35 MS/MS scans of 100 ms in the mass range of 100–1800 (total cycle time: 4 s).Switching criteria were set to ions greater than mass to charge ratio ( m/z) 350 and smaller than m/z1250 with charge state of 2–5 and an abundance threshold of more than 90 counts (cps).Former target ions were excluded for 15 s.IDA rolling collision energy (CE) parameters script was used for automatically controlling the CE.Data analysis and quantiﬁcation: The mass spectrometry data obtained were processed using PeakView®2.2 Software (SCIEX, Foster City, CA, USA) and exported as mgf ﬁles.
Proteomics data analysis were performed by using 4 search engines (Mascot Server v.2.5.1, OMSSA, X!Tandem and Myrimatch) and a target/decoy database built from sequences in the Homo sapiens proteome at Uniprot Knowledgebase. All search engines were conﬁgured to match potential peptide candidates to recali- brated spectra with mass error tolerance of 10 ppm and fragment ion tolerance of 0.02 Da, allowing for up to 2 missed tryptic cleavage sites and a maximum isotope error (13C) of 1, considering ﬁxed MMTS modiﬁcation of cysteine and variable oxidation of methionine, pyroglutamic acid from glutamine, or glutamic acid at the peptide N-terminus.Score distri- bution models were used to compute peptide-spectrum-matched p-values [ 23], and spectra recovered by an FDR ≤0.01 (peptide-level) ﬁlter were selected for quantitative analysis.
Metabolites 2022 ,12, 399 10 of 11 Differential regulation was measured using linear models [ 24], and statistical signiﬁcance was measured using q-values (FDR). All analyses were conducted using software from Proteobotics (Madrid, Spain).Gene ontology analysis was performed with Webgestalt over-representation analyses by using non-redundant biological process and non-redundant molecular function.Inter- actions between differentially expressed proteins and pathway enrichment analyses were carried out by using the STRING database (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) and the Webgestalt and Reactome web tools, respectively [ 25–27].For the STRING-based analyses, the number of k means cluster was set to 6 and the interaction score to high conﬁdence.
Analysis of individual proteins: From the teriparatide group S100A7 and F2 proteins were measured in the previously obtained serum samples by ELISA, accordingly to man- ufacturers’ instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA), whereas in the denosumab group, two complement factors (C4 and CFH) were measured with the Human Complement Panel 2 Bead-Based Multiplex Assay kit (MERCK, Darmstadt, Germany). 5.Conclusions This analysis of serum peptides suggests that both bone-forming and antiresorptive therapies impact the immune system.While the pathogenic relevance of these ﬁndings remains to be elucidated, they are worthwhile pursuing.Further investigations in this line may be important not only for a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the effects of drugs on bone, but also as a way to potentially ﬁnd novel therapeutic approaches, particularly important regarding bone anabolic therapies.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, A.d.R.
