To investigate the epigenetic in ﬂu- ence of DNA methylation on the seasonal testicular regres- sion in Magang geese, we conducted whole-genomebisulﬁte sequencing and transcriptome sequencing of testes across 3 reproductive phases during a long-day photope-riod. A total of 250,326 differentially methylated regions(DMR )w e r ei d e n t i ﬁed among the 3 comparison groups, with a signi ﬁcant number showing hypermethylation, especially in intronic regions of the genome.Integrating bisulﬁte sequencing with transcriptome sequencing data revealed that DMR-associated genes tend to be differen-tially expressed in the testes, highlighting a potential regu-latory role for DNA methylation in gene expression.Furthermore, there was a signi ﬁcant negative correlation between changes in the methylation of CG DMRs andchanges in the expression of their associated genes in thetestes.
A total of 3,359 DMR-associated differentially expressed genes ( DEG ) were identi ﬁed; functional enrich- ment analyses revealed that motor proteins, MAPK signal-ing pathway, ECM-receptor i nteraction, phagosome, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and calcium signaling mightcontribute to the testicular regression process. GSEA revealed that the signi ﬁcantly enriched activated hallmark gene set was associated with apoptosis and estrogenresponse during testicular regression, while the repressedhallmark gene set was involved in spermatogenesis.Our study also revealed that methylation changes signi ﬁcantly impacted the expression level of vitamin A metabolism-related genes during testicula r degeneration, with hyper- methylation of STRA6 and increased calmodulin levelsindicating vitamin A ef ﬂux during the testicular regression.
These ﬁndings were corroborated by pyrosequencing and real-time qPCR, which revealed that the vitamin Ametabolic pathway plays a pivotal role in testicular degen- eration under long-day conditions. Additionally, metabolo- mics analysis revealed an insuf ﬁciency of vitamin A and an abnormally high level of oxysterols accumulated in the tes-tes during testicular regression.In conclusion, our studydemonstrated that testicular degeneration in Maganggeese induced by a long-day pho toperiod is linked to vita- min A homeostasis disruption, which manifests as thehypermethylation status of STRA6, vitamin A ef ﬂux, and a high level of oxysterol accumulation.These ﬁndings offer new insights into the effects of DNA methylation on theseasonal testicular regression that occurs during long-dayphotoperiods in Magang geese.

The Mag- ang Geese, a topical short-day breeder, initiates itsbreeding season from late summer through to the follow-ing spring ( Shi et al., 2007a ;Shi et al., 2008 ).Similar to other seasonal breeders, the reproductive activation of Magang geese is in ﬂuenced by seasonal variations in daily photoperiods.Increasing evidence suggests thatexposure to a long-day photoperiod inhibits reproduc-tive activity, resulting in testicular regression and sper-matogenesis arrest in males ( Huang et al., 2008 ;Zhu et al., 2017 ;Pan et al., 2022 )./C2112024 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.

This cascade in ﬂuences sex hormone production and gametogenesis via the secretion of follicle-stimulatinghormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH) by the pituitary gland; LH acts on Leydig cells to regulate tes- tosterone production, thus regulating the seasonal activ- ities of the reproductive axis in animals ( Kuenzel, 2014 ; Yusuke Nakane, 2019 ). In seasonally breeding birds, day length triggers mor- phological alterations in their reproductive systems, par-ticularly in the testes ( Follett and Maung, 1978 ).The effect of photoperiod on the reproductive system primar-ily manifests as depleted testicular function, leading to reduced testosterone production, spermatogenesis arrest, and changes in sperm quality and quantity.Tes-tosterone is crucial for controlling male reproductiveactivities, as it in ﬂuences a wide range of physiological, morphological, and behavioral characteristics associatedwith breeding that depend on its presence.
In seasonalbreeders, male plasma T levels typically exhibit a pro-nounced peak during the breeding season, play a pivotal role in the development of male genitalia, support sperm production, and regulate mating behavior ( Shi et al., 2007a ). These alterations culminate in a decline in fertil- ity and inhibited mating behavior ( Jim/C19enez, et al., 2015 ; Zhu et al., 2017 ;Beltr /C19an-Frutos, et al., 2022 ).A long-day photoperiod caused a profound change in the architecture and function of the testes of Maganggeese.Although transcriptome responses to photoperiod effects on the testis have been extensively studied in avi- ans ( Sun et al., 2020 ;Sharma, et al., 2021 ), relatively lit- tle is known about the epigenetic impact of testicularregression during long-day photoperiods.Current knowl-edge is primarily based on genetic analyses of candidategenes associated with endocrine regulation of the HPGaxis ( Leska, et al., 2012 ;Gumu »ka, et al., 2023 ).
Epige- netic changes alter the reproductive pathways linked to male fertility in Mustela nigripes (Tennenbaum et al., 2024). In Siberian hamsters, DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a ) exhibits marked photoperiodic plasticity, with short-day photoperiods notably increasing both globalDNA methylation and Dnmt3a expression in the testes(Lynch et al., 2016 ).Recent studies have demonstrated that m6A modi ﬁcation plays a regulatory role in seasonal testicular activity.This suggests that m6A modi ﬁcation in testicular tissue may contribute to the recovery of tes- ticular function stimulated by photoperiods ( R a d e re ta l ., 2023).Growing evidence shows that DNA methylationappears to play a potential role in testicular regression induced by long-day photoperiods.
DNA methylation is a key component of epigenetic regulation; recent studies have highlighted that DNAmethylation has a substantial impact on the regulationof the seasonal reproductive behavior and phenotypicplasticity of animals ( Stevenson and Prendergast, 2013 ; Alvarado et al., 2014 ;Viitaniemi, et al., 2019 ;He et al., 2023). The epigenetics mechanisms underlying seasonal changes in testicular function in geese have not been fully elucidated.To elucidate the epigenetic effect on tes-ticular function in Magang geese, we compared the epi-genetic and transcriptional pro ﬁles of the testes.Additionally, to investigate the relationship betweenepigenetic modi ﬁcations and gene expression changes in response to long-day photoperiods, we identi ﬁed the essential genes and pathways that potentially contribute to testicular regression induced by long-day photoper- iods via differential expression analyses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and Arti ﬁcial Photoperiodism The animal trials were conducted from September 2019 to November 2019 at a geese farm located in Qingyuan City(113° 06 0E, 23° 680N), Guangdong Province. A population of 3-year-old Magang goose (n = 540, male: female =1:5)was used in the experiment.Initially, the geese were exposedto a natural photoperiod, in which day length was approxi- mating [(12 light ( L):12 dark ( D)].As the geese entered their breeding seasons and displaye d strong reproductive activity (RA stage), we collected RA samples on 27 September 2019 and initiated an arti ﬁcial photoperiod program to suppress the breeding activity of Magang geese.Subsequently, thegeese were transferred to arti ﬁcial long-day conditions (18 L: 6 D) for 17 d, leading to the decline of testicular reproductiveactivity in the population.At this stage, the laying rate in female geese decreased to 17% compared to the laying period, and samples were col lected (RD stage).
Two weeks later, the geese population was induced into the reproductiveinactivity stage, and samples w ere collected accordingly (RI stage). In the present study, 3 independent biological repli-cates were performed for each group (RA, RD, and RI).Thegeese were euthanized by inhalation of carbon dioxide andcervical dislocation, which w as performed by a laboratory technician who has extensive experience in the application of these techniques.Testis sampl es were collected.The testis tissue was immediately crosscut and ﬁxed in 4% paraformal- dehyde ( PFA ) solution for 12 h at 4°C.For RNA extraction, testicular samples were dissect ed into small pieces, frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately, and then stored at -80°C.Testicular Histology and Measurement of Hormone Concentrations Geese testicular samples were then dehydrated in an ethanol series and embedded in paraf ﬁn in accordance with standard procedures.Serial sections (5 mM) were2 FU ET AL.
mounted on slides coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).Some sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( HE) for histologi- cal observation.The slides were examined using a photo-microscope (BX51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).Werandomly selected ﬁve convoluted seminiferous tubules in each section at each stage and calculated their cross-section areas using Image Pro Plus 6.0 software.Serumconcentrations of testosterone ( T), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA ) according to the instructions provided with the kits.The detection range for T was 0.31 to20 ng/mL with a coef ﬁcient of variation ( CV) of less than 10%; for LH, 0.5 to 100 mIU/mL with a CV of lessthan 8%; and for FSH, 0.9 to 210 mIU/mL with a CV ofless than 8%.
Bisul ﬁte Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analyses Testicular samples from the 3 groups (RA, RD, and RI), each with 3 biological replicates (n = 3), were col-lected for transcriptome sequencing and whole-genomebisulﬁte sequencing ( BS-seq ). For BS-sequencing, geno- mic DNA was extracted from tissues using the QIAamp DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (69504, QIAGEN, Ger-many).A total of 500 ng of genomic DNA was subjectedto bisul ﬁte treatment using the Zymo EZ DNA Methyla- tion-Gold Kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA).Subse-quently, the bisul ﬁte-treated DNA was puri ﬁed to prepare whole-genome bisul ﬁte sequencing libraries with an EpiGnome Kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI, USA).All libraries were sequenced using the BGI MGISEQ-2000 platform with 100 bp paired-end reads (BGI, Shenzhen,Guangdong, China).Raw data quality control involvedtrimming low-quality bases and removing adapters withTrimmomatic v.0.36 ( Bolger et al., 2014 ).
The reference genome index was constructed using HISAT2 v2.1.0software ( Kim et al., 2019 ) from the chromosome-level genome of the Lion-head goose (Anser cygnoides), which was assembled by Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering (data unpublished). Clean reads werealigned to the reference genome with default parameters,and unique mapping reads were utilized for methylationanalyses.The bisul ﬁte conversion ef ﬁciency was assessed by cal- culating the proportion of methylated cytosines (falsediscovery rate, FDR <0.05), with those covered by at least ﬁve sequencing reads considered methylation sites for subsequent analyses.DNA methylation levels weredetermined by calculating the proportion of methylatedcytosines out of the total cytosines for each sampleacross all 3 sequence contexts.
The consistency betweenbiological replicates was veri ﬁed through sliding window analysis (window size =100 kb and step size =50 kb).Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identi- ﬁed using MethylKit ( Akalin et al., 2012 ) with a 100 bp window size and a 50 bp step size, applying theBenjamini −Hochberg method for multiple test correc- tion ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ). Pearson ’s correla- tion coef ﬁcient between methylation levels in pairs of biological replicates was calculated within 3 groups.RNA-seq and Differential Gene Expression Analysis Total RNA was extracted and subjected to RNA sequencing using the BGISeq-500 platform, which gener-ated 50 bp single-end reads.Clean reads ﬁltered by Fastp ( Chen et al., 2018a ) were mapped to the goose genome using HISAT2 v2.1.0 software ( Kim et al., 2019) with default parameters.
Differentially expressed genes ( DEG ) were identi ﬁed using DEseq2(v.1.26.0) (Love et al., 2014 ), with a threshold of FDR <=0.05 and a fold change >=2. Principal component analysis (PCA ) was performed at each stage using the regular- ized log2 transform of normalized counts for all genes, asgenerated by DESeq2 (v.1.26.0) ( Love et al., 2014 ).Pearson correlation for gene expression (log2 of the nor-malized counts) between biological replicates was calcu-lated using R v.3.6.2 ( https://www.R-project.org ).The DMR-associated genes were subjected to gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using Metascape ( https:// Metascape.org/ ).KEGG pathway annotation was per- formed according to the KEGG database ( https:// www.genome.jp/kegg/ )(Kanehisa and Goto, 2000 ; Kanehisa, 2019 ;Kanehisa et al., 2023 ), and KEGG enrichment analysis was carried out using KOBAS ( Bu et al., 2021 ), with p<0.05 set as the threshold for signi ﬁ- cant enrichment.
The Primers used for qPCR are listed in Table S1. Detection of vitamin A metabolite, steroid metabolite, and calcium/calmodulin level inthe testis The concentrations of vitamin A metabolites in the testicular tissues of geese at the 3 stages were measuredusing the AB SCIEX QTRAP LC ‒MS/MS detection platform.Testicular samples were homogenized and processed for liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS) analysis within 24 h.Six vitamin Ametabolites (isotretinoin, retinoic acid, all-trans-retinol,all-trans-retinal, and retinyl acetate) and 43 steroids(Table S2) were quanti ﬁed using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters, Framingham, MA).Chromatog-raphy was conducted on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 £100 mm, Waters) with a 5 mL sample injection volume by an autosampler, and the columntemperature was maintained at 40°C.
Mass spectrome-try analysis was performed under positive ion mode con-ditions with the following parameters: ion sourcetemperature at 500°C; ion spray voltage at 5,000 V; cur-tain gas (nitrogen) pressure, 30 psi; and both atomizingand auxiliary gas pressure, 60 psi. The multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM ) scan method was utilized for mass spectrometry.Calmodulin ( CaM ) levels were detectedPHOTOPERIOD ALTER DNA METHYLATION IN GEESE 3 in a testicular homogenate using a chicken CaM ELISA kit (SBJ-C108, SenBeiJia Biological Technology Co., Ltd.Nanjing, China), and the calcium concentration inthe serum samples was determined using a calcium assaykit (C004-2-1, Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Insti-tute, Nanjing, China).Bisul ﬁte Conversion and Pyrophosphate Sequencing The PyroMark Q96 ID Pyrophosphate Sequencing System (Qiagen, Seoul, South Korea) was used to assessthe methylation status of various CpG sites within theTSS region of STRA6, TGFB2 , and TGFBR2 .
Primers were designed using PyroMark Assay Design 2.0(https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources ) and featured a biotinylated 5 0end. The quality and integrity of the amplicons were veri ﬁed via agarose gel electrophoresis prior to pyrophosphate sequencing, as shown in Table S1.Testis DNA was bisul ﬁte-transformed using an Epi- Tect DNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following themanufacturer ’s recommendations.Two cycles of dena- turation at 95°C for 5 min, incubation at 60°C for10 min, and subsequent column-based DNA puri ﬁcation were performed.PCR ampli ﬁcation of 25 ng of bisul ﬁte- transformed DNA was performed using a PyroMark PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the following PCR conditions: 95°C for 15 min; 45 x (95°C for 30 s; 56°C for 30 s; 72°C for 30 s) and 72°C for 5 min.PCRs reac-tions were performed in a Veriti 96-well thermal cycler(Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA), and the quality and size of the amplicons were assessed by aga-rose gel electrophoresis.
Pyrophosphate sequencing wasperformed on a PyroMark ID pyrophosphate sequencer (Qiagen, Seoul, South Korea) using PyroMark Gold Q96 reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, USA), and methylationlevels were calculated using PyroMark Q96 software(version 1.0.10; Qiagen). All pyrophosphate sequencingassays were validated across a range of methylated tounmethylated DNA ratios (0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, and100%) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), from which standardcurves were generated to determine primer sensitivity.Real-Time qPCR Validation Total RNA was reverse transcribed according to the instructions of the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara,RR037A, Takara Biomedical Technology, Shiga, Otsu,Japan).Primers for the selected DEGs and the house- keeping gene ( Zhang et al., 2021 ) were designed using Primer Premier 5 software (Table S1).The Primersused were synthesized by Shenzhen BGI Co., Ltd.
TheqPCR reaction system included 5 mL of qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix; 0.5 mL of forward and reverse Pri- mers, 0.5 mL of cDNA, and 10 mL of ddH 2O. The reac- tion conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cyclesof 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 10 min.The default settings for the dissolution curve were used.Three replicates were performed for eachsample.The relative expression of each gene was calcu- lated using 2 /C044 CTstatistical analysis.All the data are shown as the mean §SEM.Isolation and Culture of Leydig Cells From Adult Magang Geese Under aseptic conditions, the left testis of a mature gander was quickly harvested and placed in ice-cold PBS, and the tunica albuginea and blood vessels were carefully removed to maintain testicular parenchymaintegrity.The parenchyma was rinsed in D-Hank ’s solu- tion, placed in a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube, andgently disaggregated with tweezers.
Next, 0.1% Type IIcollagenase (1 mg/mL) was added and incubated at 37°C for 2 min, followed by agitation at 200 rpm for 25 min.The digestion process was stopped by adding DMEM- F12 medium, and the mixture was ﬁltered through 70mm and 40 mm strainers. The ﬁltrate was centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min to remove the supernatant.Thecell pellet was resuspended in DMEM-F12.The cell sus-pension was incubated with DMEM-F12 containing10% FBS, 2% antibiotics, and 3 b-HSD staining solution at 37°C for 6 h to assess stromal cell proportions.Thecell suspension was then layered over Percoll gradients (60, 40, 25, and 17%) and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4° C for 30 min.Cell bands between 25% and 40% Percollwere collected, washed, and resuspended in DMEM-F12medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 2% antibiot-ics.
For stromal cell culture, cells were adjusted to a con-centration of 2 £10 6cells/mL, seeded into 12-well plates, and cultured at 37°C with 5% CO 2, 95% O 2, and saturated humidity, with medium changes every 48 h. Following a 48-h cultivation period, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed withPBS.Subsequently, a mixture of culture medium supple-mented with 3 b-HSD staining solution at a 2:1 ratio was added, and the mixture was incubated for more than 6h.Fields displaying the characteristic black-blue stain-ing were identi ﬁed, documented, and photographed through microscopic examination.To investigate the effect of vitamin A supplementa- tion on Leydig cells, Leydig cells were seeded into 24-well culture plates at a density of 1 £10^6 cells/mL and treated with Retinol (R7632, Sigma-Aldrich) at a con-centration of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 mM, respectively.Each group had ﬁve replicate wells.
After 24 h of cultivation at 37°C in a 5% CO 2atmosphere, cells were harvested for total RNA extraction to assess gene expression. Aim to explore the genetic function of STRA6 on Ley- dig cells, Leyding cells were seeded at a density of1£10^6 cells/mL in 24-well plates and were transfected at 80% con ﬂuency.siRNA oligos were designed and syn- thesized by Sangon Biotech (see Table S1 for details).The cells were transfected with 25 mM siRNA after 24 h incubation at 37°C.The transfection reagents Lipofect-amine 3,000 (L3000001,Thermo Fisher) were used according to the manufacturer ’s instructions.After 24 h of incubation at 37°C and 5% CO 2, the Leydig cells were4 FU ET AL.collected for total RNA extraction to analyze gene expression.Statistical Analysis Normal distribution and variance tests were assessed by the D ’Agostino & Pearson test and F-test, respec- tively.Differences between groups were compared usingt-test, and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPadPrism 7.0.
p<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signi ﬁcance. RESULTS Testicular Morphology and Histology During Testicular Regression Induced by a Long-Day Photoperiod Exposure to long-day photoperiods signi ﬁcantly in ﬂu- ences the reproductive status of Magang geese.Substan-tial differences in testicular size and histology wereobserved across the 3 groups.Under the in ﬂuence of long-day photoperiods, both the gonadosomatic index (GSI = gonad mass/body mass £100%) and testicular volume signi ﬁcantly decreased.Histological of testicular tissue sections revealed a notable decrease in the area ofthe testicular varicose ducts during prolonged daylightconditions ( Figure 1 A).This was accompanied by a gradual reduction in the number of spermatogonia, Ley-dig cells, and spermatozoa, with the RI stage showing an almost complete absence of elongated sperm (Figure 1 B).
Our results indicate that long-day photo- periods exert an inhibiting effect on the reproductiveactivity and spermatogenesis in Magang geese gander.The serum FSH, LH, and T concentration showed signif-icant decline during testicular regression induced bylong-day photoperiod ( Figure 1 C). Transcriptome Changes During Testicular Regression Induced by a Long-DayPhotoperiod To determine the effect of transcriptome changes on testicular regression under long-day photoperiods, wegenerated and analyzed gene-expression data for testesacross 3 stages to identify DEGs (Table S3 and TableS4).Principal component analysis ( PCA ) of the goose testicular transcriptome data revealed signi ﬁcant differ- ences between the groups and high repeatability among the samples ( Figure 2 A).
Based on the number of DEGs between groups, we identi ﬁed 602 DEGs between RA and RD, including 482 upregulated and 120 downregu-lated DEGs; 1,899 DEGs between RD and RI, with 699upregulated and 1,200 downregulated DEGs; and 3,457DEGs between RA and RI, consisting of 1,659 upregu-lated and 1,798 downregulated DEGs ( Figure 2 B). Notably, the number of DEGs signi ﬁcantly increased as the process of reproductive degeneration progressed.Furthermore, cluster analysis of these DEGs revealed ﬁve statistically signi ﬁcant clusters ( Figure 2 C).Gene ontology ( GO) analyses were conducted on the DEGs associated with testicular degeneration regulatedby a long-day photoperiod (Table S5).The DEGs dem-onstrated distinct enrichment patterns across the 3stages.In Clusters 1 and 4, DEGs were enriched in GOcategories such as cell cycle, mannose biosynthesis,response to environmental stress, sexual reproduction, and regulation of neuron differentiation.
In Cluster 2, DEGs were signi ﬁcantly associated with cell division, chromosome condensation and segregation, and aminemetabolic processes. DEGs in Cluster 3 were notablyenriched in the regulation of the cell cycle, morphogene-sis of anatomical structures, and steroid hormone-medi-ated signaling pathways.Finally, the GO categoriesassociated with Cluster 5 included neurotransmitter transport, signal transduction, and the regulation of cell death.KEGG pathway analyses of the DEGs provided a detailed investigation of transcriptome changes acrossthe 3 stages (Table S6).We found signi ﬁcant enrichment of reproduction-related pathways in Cluster 3, includingthe calcium signaling pathway, TGF-beta signalingpathway, GnRH signaling pathway, thyroid hormone signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, and pro- lactin signaling pathway.
Additionally, pathwaysinvolving axon guidance and synapses, such as the sero-tonergic synapse, glutamatergic synapse, and dopami-nergic synapse, were signi ﬁcantly represented. Cluster 5 displayed enriched activity in the PI3K-Akt signalingpathway, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction,axon guidance, and Rap1 signaling pathway.Con- versely, Clusters 1, 2, and 4 showed no signi ﬁcant path- way enrichment.For validation, ﬁve genes related to the TGF-beta signaling pathway were selected for analysisby qRT-PCR (Figure S1).DNA Methylation Pro ﬁling During Testicular Regression Induced by a Long-DayPhotoperiod Whole-genome bisul ﬁte sequencing (BS-seq) was per- formed on the testes of Magang geese to explore themethylation changes under long-day photoperiods.Thestudy included 3 biological replicates for each period,with an average sequencing depth of approximately30X.
On average, BS-seq covers more than 85% of allcytosines, including CG, CHG, and CHH (with H repre- senting A, T, or C), in the goose genome (Table S7). The average genome-wide cytosine methylation levelswere approximately 86.98, 0.45, and 0.44% in the CG,CHG, and CHH contexts, respectively, in the RA group;approximately 87.48, 0.48, and 0.49% in the CG, CHG,and CHH contexts, respectively, in the RD group; andapproximately 87.37, 0.50, and 0.51% in the CG, CHG,and CHH contexts, respectively, in the RI group.CG methylation was predominant in the Magang goose tes- tes, with minimal methylation observed in the CHG orPHOTOPERIOD ALTER DNA METHYLATION IN GEESE 5 CHH context.The proportion of methylated cytosine in the GC context showed no signi ﬁcant variation between replicates ( Table 1 ,Ftest, p>0.05).
We further examined the dynamic changes in DNA methylation level at gene locations during the process oftesticular reproductive degeneration under the regula-tion of a long-day photoperiod. Analysis of the methylation distribution at gene loci in testicular tissue revealed a signi ﬁcantly greater increase in CG methylation within the gene body than in thetranscriptional start site region ( TSS) and transcrip- tional termination region ( TES ) region ( Figure 2 E).Conversely, the methylation levels of both CHG andCHH exhibited similar distribution patterns.Notably,long-day photoperiod signi ﬁcantly increased thegenome-wide methylation levels in all 3 contexts across the 3 stages of the testes ( Figure 2 D, T-test, p<0.05).These ﬁndings indicate a differential regulation of gene expression through DNA methylation in the testis under the in ﬂuence of long-day photoperiod regulation.
Differentially Methylated Regions During Testicular Regression Induced by Long-DayPhotoperiod Consistent with previous studies, DNA methylation in the goose genome occurs primarily at CG sites. To explore the variation in methylation levels in the testis across the RA, RD, and RI stages, we identi ﬁed DMRs Figure 1.Effects of photoperiod on the histomorphology of goose testes.(A) The weight ratio of the testes to the body (%).(B) Testicular weight (g).(C) Area of seminiferous tubules (nm2).(D) Histology of the testis by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E): LC, Leydig cells; Spg, spermatogonia; Spz, spermatozoa.The error bars represent the means §SEMs (n = 8, each period); ** p<0.005, *** p= 0.0001, **** p<0.0001.6 FU ET AL.for each comparison group (RA vs.RD, RA vs.RI, RD vs.RI) using a beta-binomial model (Table S8), includ-ing DMRs in the CG, CHG, and CHH contexts.
Amongthe 3 comparison groups, we found 4,846 DMRs betweenRA and RD, comprising 3,904 hypermethylated DMRs and 942 hypomethylated DMRs; 22,399 DMRs betweenRD and RI, comprising 18,428 hypermethylated DMRsand 3,971 hypomethylated DMRs; and 223,081 DMRs Figure 2.

Nota-bly, a substantial increase in CG methylation levels wasobserved across numerous regions of the testis(Figure 2 F). Furthermore, we mapped the DMRs to genomic and genic features and quanti ﬁed the number of DMRs associated with gene-related hypermethylation and low methylation in CG contexts.Our analysis indi- cated that the DMRs, especially those that are hyperme-thylated, are predominantly distributed across variousgene-related regions, with signi ﬁcant enrichment in intron regions ( Figure 2 G).Inﬂuence of DNA Methylation on Gene Expression To explore the potential impact of methylation changes in goose testes on gene expression under a long-day photoperiod, we analyzed the differential gene expression linked to CG DMRs ( Figure 3 A).A gene was deemed to be associated with CG-DMR if a minimum ofone CG-DMR was found either within the gene or in aregion extending up to 2 kb upstream or downstreamfrom the gene.
Within the testis, 3,359 of 13,572 DMR-associated genes (accounting for 24.8%) were recognizedas DEGs across the 3 stages, and Fisher ’s exact test indi- cated that DMR-associated genes were signi ﬁcantly more likely to exhibit differential expression ( P<0.001). More than 70% of CG DMR-associated DEGs containedCG DMRs in their introns (Table S9).We investigatedthe relationship between DNA methylation alterations at CG DMRs and changes in the expression of their asso-ciated genes during reproductive degeneration in goosetestes under long-day conditions.Our ﬁndings demon- strated a notable negative correlation between the DNAmethylation level and gene expression.Long-day photo-period-induced CG methylation changes have a signi ﬁ- cant negative impact on genome-wide gene expression (Figure 3 B).These results suggest that differential gene expression in the testis may be associated with pheno-typic characteristics and epigenetic regulation.
To further identify key molecules and pathways con- tributing to the reproductive degeneration under long-day conditions, we performed GO annotation analysisand GSEA. The most enriched GO terms in biological processes ( BP), cellular components ( CC), and molecu- lar function ( MF) are presented in Table S10.The anal- ysis between RA and RI highlighted that positiveregulation of kinase activity, positive regulation of trans-ferase activity, and positive regulation of catalytic activ-ity were predominant in BP; cell periphery, cellularanatomical entity, and cellular component were highlyenriched in CC; and signi ﬁcant enrichment in MF was noted for transcription regulator activity and transcrip- tion cis-regulatory region binding ( Figures 4 A, 4B, and 4C).However, no signi ﬁcant GO term was enriched in the RA and RD comparisons.
In the comparisonbetween RA and RI, KEGG pathway analysis revealedsigniﬁcant enrichment of 11 signaling pathways related to DAM-related, including motor proteins, MAPK sig-naling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Figure 3.

Among the genes showing hypermethylation in the CG contextwithin the gene body and higher expression in the RIduring the testicular regression, 2 DMR-associatedDEGs involved in the response to vitamin A were identi-ﬁed, including STRA6 andRBP5 . These ﬁndings sug- gest the important role of vitamin A signaling intesticular regression induced by long-day photoperiods via DNA methylation.Speci ﬁcally, we focused on the effect of DNA methylation changes on the mRNAexpression levels of the genes related to vitamin A signal-ing and TGF- bsignaling pathways in the testis.Pyrose- quencing was utilized to assess the methylation levels ofSTRA6, TGFB2, andTGFBR2 (Table 2 ).Furthermore, we identi ﬁed signi ﬁcant differences in genes related to the retinoic acid pathway among the DMR-associated DEGs.
We selected 2 upregulated genes ( STRA6 and RBP5 ) and 4 downregulated genes ( RBP7, ALDH1A3, CYP27C1 , and RARA ) for RT-qPCR veri ﬁcation (Figure 5 C), and the results were consistent with theRNA-seq data. These ﬁndings indicate that the vitamin A signaling may play a crucial role in testicular repro-duction.Our results revealed signi ﬁcant variations in methylation levels of the STRA6, TGFB2 , and TGFBR2 genes between RA and RI, with an apparent increase in methylation correlating with the progression of testicular regression.Alterations in Vitamin A-Related Metabolite Content in the Testes Interestingly, in comparison to the RA stage, STRA6 exhibited an increased expression and showed a highmethylation level in the CG context within their gene body and promoter in the RI stage (Table S9).As STRA6 is critical for cellular vitamin A uptake andhomeostasis, we investigated vitamin A metabolism ingoose testes during testicular regression.
We quanti ﬁed the concentrations of vitamin A and its related metabo-lites across 3 stages by using LC-MS/MS ( Figure 5 A). Compared to the other 4 vitamin A metabolites, all-trans-retinol showed a high concentration in the testis.We observed a signi ﬁcant decrease in all-trans-retinol and retinyl acetate concentration in the RI stageTable 2.Methylation level of STRA6, TGFB2 , and TGFBR2 validated by pyrophosphate sequencing.Assay Condition Sample IDPos.1 Pos.2 Pos.3 Pos.4 Mean Meth.(%) Meth.(%) Meth.(%) Meth.(%) STRA6 RA RA1 63.53 54.79 69.57 / 62.63 RA2 64.38 57.28 68.13 / 63.26RA3 60.07 55.27 64.69 / 60.01RA4 59.39 55.92 69.32 / 61.54 RA5 68.52 66.37 71.84 / 68.91 RA6 53.31 51.45 34.42 / 46.39 RI RI1 68.88 60.54 64.6 / 64.67 RI2 75.27 67.86 67.82 / 70.32RI4 68.08 57.39 64.98 / 63.48RI6 76.89 73.55 70.79 / 73.74 T test RA vs.

compared to that in the RA stage ( Figure 5 B). This reduction in vitamin A metabolite content suggested that a decrease in vitamin A supply may inhibit testicu- lar reproduction and development.Relative to the RAstage, genes involved in vitamin A signaling exhibiteddynamic changes, with signi ﬁcantly increased mRNA levels of STRA6 and RBP5 observed in the RI stage (Figure 5 C).The Molecular Function of STRA6 in Steroid Biosynthesis in Leydig Cells in GooseTestes Recent studies suggest that the role of STRA6 extends beyond mere retinol transportation and also as a signi ﬁ- cant player within various signaling networks.
Toexplore the impact of vitamin A on the expression ofvitamin A signaling and steroid signaling genes in theLeydig cells of Magang geese, we investigated themRNA level of genes involved in the vitamin A signaling pathway (including STRA6, RBP5, RBP7, ALDH1A3 , and RARA ), the steroid signaling pathway (such as StAR, HSD17B7 , and SRD5A 3), and the calmodulin- related gene CaMK4 . Employing Ledying cell culture (Figure 6 A and 6B), we supplemented the culture medium with vitamin A, and observed a dose-dependentenhancement in the expression levels of STRA 6 and RBP5 .The introduction of 5 mM vitamin A markedly enhanced the mRNA expression level of genes related to the vitamin A signaling pathway ( STRA6 andRBP5 ), steroid biosynthesis ( StAR andSRD5A3 ), and calmodu- lin protein CaMK4 (Figures 6 C and 6D).
To explore the effect of vitamin A on the expression of steroid biosyn-thesis genes in the Leydig cells of Magang geese, weemployed siRNA-mediated knockdown of STRA6 to elu- cidate the relationship between vitamin A uptake and steroidogenic functionality in Leydig cells. Subse- quently, we found that knocking down the STRA6 genevia siRNA signi ﬁcantly increased the expression level of the steroidogenesis gene StAR in Leydig cells but had no signiﬁcant impact on RBP5 gene expression ( Figures 6 E and 6F).These results reveal the crucial role of vitaminA in regulating the expression of speci ﬁc genes in the Leydig cells of Magang geese, particularly within thevitamin A signaling and steroid biosynthesis pathway.Effects of Photoperiod on Eendogenous Neutral Steroid Metabolism and Ca2 +/Calmodulin in Testis The decrease in reproductive activity in Magang geese may be linked to disrupted steroid production under along-day photoperiod.
To explore the dynamics ofendogenous neutral steroids in geese testes, we per-formed LC-MS/MS to measure the concentration of ste-roids ( Figure 7 A). Thirty-one steroids were identi ﬁed in the testes; 8 of them displayed changes across the 3stages, indicating alterations in steroid biosynthesis throughout the 3 phases during seasonal testicular regression.The concentrations of endogenous testoster-one and androstenedione remained consistent across theRA, RD, and RI stages, while the dihydrotestosterone(DHT ) level increased signi ﬁcantly between the RA and RI stages.Additionally, the concentrations of 2androgen metabolites, 11-hydroxyandrosterone and 25-hydroxyandrosterone, progressively increased during the testicular degeneration of Magang geese, with signi ﬁ- cant increases between each comparison.The level ofvitamin D3, which is crucial for sex hormone synthesisregulation, was markedly higher in the RI stage than inthe RA stage.
Moreover, we observed that an abnor-mally high levels of oxysterols accumulated in the testesunder the nonbreeding status; 3 oxysterols, 7-ketocholes-terol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 24-hydroxycholesterol were highly accumulated in the testicular tissues in the RI stage. We also compared the calmodulin content Figure 5.Changes in vitamin A-related metabolites and gene expression in goose testes during reproductive degeneration.(A) Possible pathway for the ﬂow of retinoids in the testis: retinol-RBP-TTR, retinol bound to the retinol binding protein; transthyretin complex; STRA6, stimulated by retinoic acid gene 6 cell membrane receptor; LRAT, lecithin retinol transferase; CRBP, cellular retinol binding protein; RDH, retinol dehydrogena se; ALDH, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase; RA, retinoic acid; CYP26, cytochrome P-450 enzymes from the cyp26 family; RAR, retinoic acid receptor;RXR, rexinoid receptor.

Pre- vious studies have indicated that the cellular mechanism of testicular regression is related to apoptosis in bothgerm cells and Sertoli cells, as well as a decrease in thenumber of Leydig cells ( Morales et al., 2002 ;Islam et al., 2012;Jim/C19enez et al., 2015 ;Beltr /C19an-Frutos et al., 2022 ; Valentini, et al., 2022 ). In recent years, the underlying mechanisms involved in testicular regression and loss offertility in males have been well-studied in mammals (Sharma et al., 2019 ;Wang et al., 2019 ;Tabecka-Lonc- zynska et al., 2020 ;Wang et al., 2021 ;Yao et al., 2023a ; Yao et al., 2023b ).Increasing evidence supports the view that neuroendocrine regulation of the Figure 6.STRA6 gene expression knockdown by siRNA induces the transport of cholesterol for mitochondrial steroidogenesis in goose Leydig cells.(A) Geese Leydig cells were cultured for 24 h.(B) Expression of 3 b-HSD in goose Leydig cells.

How- ever, the genetic mechanism underlying testicular regression in short-day breed Magang geese remains largely unknown. Previous studies have indicated thatDNA methylation plays a critical role in testis develop-ment and the compensatory response in the testis ( Chen et al., 2018b ;Wang et al., 2018 ;Anqi et al., 2022 ).Through genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, wecompared the methylation patterns across the 3 stagesof testicular degeneration induced by long-light expo- sure.In this study, we reported the global methylation patterns of testicular tissues of geese, which are highlysimilar to those of mammals, and revealed that DNAmethylation occurs preferentially at CpG sites in thetestes of geese.
The average CpG, CHG, and CHH genome-wide scale methylation levels in testicular tissueprogressively increased and signi ﬁcant differed during the process of long light-induced testicular degeneration.A Previous study suggested that DNA methylation isinvolved in light modulation ( Takaki et al., 2020 ) and is a widespread mechanism of light-induced circadian clock plasticity ( Azzi et al., 2014 ). This suggests that DNA methylation patterns play an important role in the HPGaxis as a regulatory mechanism in response to photoperi-odic changes and contribute to regulating reproductivebehavior in seasonal breeders ( Stevenson and Prender- gast 2013 ;Viitaniemi et al., 2019 ;Liu et al., 2023 ).At the epigenetic level, the pattern of CpG association with gene features revealed that the intronic regions of the goose genome comprised the largest proportion ofDMRs in the testes.Compared to short-day conditions,long-light stimulation induces dramatic CG hyperme-thylation in the testis.
In contrast to the brain, the testisshows great genome instability and predominantlyexhibits CG hypermethylation under long-light stimula-tion. Additionally, at the transcriptome level, the testis contains more DEGs ( Liu et al., 2023 ).The correlation between methylation changes in CG DMRs and expres-sion changes in their associated genes was signi ﬁcant for the genes that contained CG DMRs in their exons, Figure 7.Alternations in Testicular steroid metabolism and Ca2+concentration during the reproductive degeneration process in Magang geese.*p<0.05, ** p<0.01,**** p<0.0001 (A) The concentration of endogenous neutral steroids detected in testes at the 3 stages.(B) In calcium signal- ing, the mRNA level of CaMK4 andCaMK2a , and the concentration of calmodulin were investigated in testes across the 3 stages.Serum calcium (Ca2+ ) concentration was also compared across the 3 stages.PHOTOPERIOD ALTER DNA METHYLATION IN GEESE 13 introns, upstream regions, and downstream regions.
Sig- niﬁcant correlations were detected between the methyla- tion changes in long-light-induced DMRs and theexpression changes in the DEGs associated with theDMRs. Therefore, long light-induced CG methylationchanges signi ﬁcantly negatively impact genome-wide gene expression in the testis.To evaluate the potential impact of methylation changes associated with long-light-induced testicular degeneration on gene expression, we examined gene expression associated with CpG DMRs in testiculardegeneration.We performed KEGG enrichment analy-sis, which revealed that pathways related to ECM-recep-tor interactions, TGF-beta signaling, and focal adhesionwere both differentially expressed and methylated acrossthe 3 stages.Previous studies have shown that testoster-one-retinoic acid signaling is a key factor in the regula- tion of seasonal reproduction and spermatogenesis in the testes of plateau pikas ( Wang et al., 2019 ).
Retinoic acid plays an important role in testicular development andfunction, especially spermatogenesis, by regulating theexpression of target genes. Gene ontology term enrich-ment analysis revealed that the 14 DMR-associatedDEGs were signi ﬁcantly enriched in response to retinoic acid between the RA and RI comparison.Unlike the ﬁndings in mammals, where different genes may be implicated, the genes associated with seasonal testiculardegeneration in geese were identi ﬁed as STRA6, RBP5, and RBP7 instead of STRA8 and RBP4.In our study, long light-induced testicular regression was associated with alterations in DNA methylationand the expression of genes involved in the vitamin Ametabolism pathway.
STRA6, a member receptor of the retinol-RBP complex, has been shown to be a bidirec- tional transporter of vitamin A across blood-tissue bar-riers ( Amengual et al., 2014 ;Kelly et al., 2016 ;Dhokia and Macip, 2021 ), and its regulatory mechanism is con- trolled by calmodulin, calmodulin signi ﬁcantly affects the vitamin A transport activity of STRA6, andincreased calcium/calmodulin promotes the ef ﬂux of vitamin A from cells and inhibits the in ﬂux of vitamin A through STRA6 ( Zhong et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, Ca2 + signaling regulates vitamin A transport via structuralchanges in CaM-STRA6 ( Young et al., 2021 ).STRA6 is strongly expressed at the level of blood-organ barriers,exhibiting a high level of expression in Sertoli cells(Bouillet et al., 1997 ).In our study, STRA6 had a hyper- methylated upstream sequence in the RI, which corre-lated with an increased expression level in these inactive testes.
We also detected a higher concentration of cal- modulin protein in the testicular homogenate in the RIstage, which suggested a potential correlation betweencalmodulin dysregulation and reproduction failure.Indeed, vitamin A accumulation signi ﬁcantly decreased in the RI group. Growing evidence supports the viewthat vitamin A plays an important role in regulating tes-ticular functions.In rodents, vitamin A de ﬁciency has an adverse effect on testosterone secretion ( Yang et al., 2018).In adults, an excess of vitamin A leads to an increase in basal testosterone secretion andspermatogenetic disorders ( Livera et al., 2002 ); Consis- tent with our observations in the testis, insuf ﬁcient vita- min A and decreased testosterone in the serum ofindividuals in the RI stage.Previous studies have shown that loss of STRA6 func- tion is critical for maintaining vitamin A homeostasis inperipheral tissues ( Kelly and von Lintig, 2015 ).
STRA6- deﬁcient mice exhibit eye deformities that are character- istic of vitamin A de ﬁciency ( Ruiz, et al., 2012 ). RBP5 is a new member of the classical retinol-binding protein (RBP ) family and has been shown to be involved in ret- inol metabolism ( Folli, et al., 2001 ); with its functional similarity to the other RBPs, RBP5 may affect retinoiduptake.As expected, in goose Leydig cells, the expres-sion levels of both STRA6 and RBP5 was markedlyincreased in response to vitamin A, as did those of genesinvolved in the steroidogenesis pathway, including StAR and SRD5A3.Previous studies have shown that retinoids enhance StAR transcription and steroidogene-sis (Livera et al., 2002 ;Manna, et al., 2023 ).However, very little is known about the relationship betweenSTRA6 and RBP5.STRA6 knockdown did not signi ﬁ- cantly alter the expression of RBP5 in the Leydig cells ofgeese.
In addition to the direct effect of vitamin A on ste- roidogenesis, our results showed a high level of oxyster- ols present in the testicular tissues in the RI stage. Theconcentrations of 7-ketocholesterol, 25-hydroxycholes-terol, and 24-hydroxycholesterol signi ﬁcantly increased in the RI stage.Current evidence indicates that oxyster-ols play an important role in cholesterol homeostasisand are extensively involved in inhibiting the biosynthe-sis of cholesterol ( Luu et al., 2016 ).Oxysterols regulate steroidogenesis through the modulation of StAR activity (King et al., 2004 ).On the other hand, nuclear receptors for oxysterols are also important regulators of germ cellphysiology ( Volle et al., 2007 ;Dallel et al., 2018 ).
LXR can be activated by multiple oxysterols, in LXR nullmice, germ cell apoptosis increases, leading to reproduc-tive disorders ( S/C18edes et al., 2018 ).7-Ketocholesterol is the predominant and most toxic oxysterol and is associ- ated with many diseases and disabilities associated with aging. The buildup of the 7-ketocholesterol impedes nor-mal cholesterol metabolism and has the ability to signi ﬁ- cantly stimulate rapid ROS production and, eventually,apoptosis ( Anderson et al., 2020 ).CONCLUSIONS In summary, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation patternsduring long light-induced testicular degeneration inMagang geese.We identi ﬁed signi ﬁcant changes in DNA methylation across the 3 reproductive stages.Moreover, we discovered numerous genes that exhibitedhypermethylation during the seasonal testicular regres-sion occurring in the nonbreeding season for Magang geese.
Epigenetic changes in these genes may lead to the ef ﬂux of vitamin A from the testicular Leydig cells,14 FU ET AL. thereby contributing to seasonal testicular degenera- tion.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by Key Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(2020B020222003 ), the key discipline research capacity improvement project of Guangdong Province(2021ZDJS006 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province ( 2021A1515010781 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32072730 ).We sincerely thank Aimei Dai and Zhongqi Liufu at Sun Yat-sen University for the valuable discus-sion and helpful comments on this manuscript.Author Contributions: X.S, YB.T, and YM.H con- ceived the idea and designed the experiments, X.S andYT.F wrote the manuscript, DY.L, YS.W, JX.L, YL.X,X.S, and YT, F performed experiments and data analy-sis, JQ.P, DL.J, and HJ.OY helped to collect the sam- ples.All authors read and approved the ﬁnal manuscript.
