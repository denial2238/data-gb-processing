A total of 600 Hy-line brown laying hens at 40 wk of age were ran-domly divided into 5 dieta ry treatments, each group ’sd i e - tary supplemental levels of b-carotene were 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 mg/kg feed, and the vitamin A levels were all8,000 IU/kg. After 14-wk trial, samples were collected,then carotenoids and different forms of vitamin A were detected using the novel method developed by our labora- tory.We found that dietary b-carotene treatment had no signiﬁcant effects on laying hens ’production performance and egg quality ( P>0.05), except the yolk color.The deposition of b-carotene in the body gradually increased (P<0.01) with the supplemental dose, whereas the con- tents of lutein and zeaxanthin decreased ( P<0.05).When the b-carotene supplemental level was above 30 mg/kg in the diet, the different forms of vitamin A inin serum, liver, ovary, and yol ks were increased compared to the control group ( P<0.05).
However, these indicators decreased when the additional dose was 120 mg/kg. More-over, the mRNA levels of the genes involved in b-carotene absorption, bioconversion, and negative feedback regula-tion in duodenal mucosa and liver were upregulated afterlong-term feeding ( P<0.05).Histological staining of the ovaries indicated that the deposition of b-carotene led to a lower rate of follicle atresia ( P<0.05), and this positive effects may be related to the antioxidant function of b-car- o t e n e ,w h i c hc a u s e dar e d u c t i o no fo x i d a t i o np r o d u c t si nthe ovary ( P<0.05).Altogether, b-carotene could accu- mulate in laying hens intactly and exert its biologicalfunctions in tissue.Meanwhile, a part of b-carotene could also be converted into vitamin A but this bioconversionhas an upper limit and negative feedback regulation.

On account of ani- mals being unable to synthesize b-carotene in vivo, it is important to obtain it through food intake for the healthbeneﬁts (Mel/C19endez-Martínez, 2019 ).In addition to beingconsumed as a nutritional supplement in the human diet, this bioactive compound has been applied as a feedadditive for livestock and poultry production.
However,most studies in recent years have mainly focused on the positive effects of dietary b-carotene for animals ( Hui et al., 2020 ;Yuan et al., 2020 ;Yang et al., 2021 ;Fawzy et al., 2022 ), such as antioxidant action, immune response, development of intestinal barriers, and modu-lation of gut microbiota. There are limited reports onthe characteristics of b-carotene absorption, deposition, and bioconversion into vitamin A in different animals.In general, the small intestine is the major site for the absorption and bioconversion of carotenoids ( Von Lintig et al., 2020 ), especially in the proximal parts of it.After ingestion, the b-carotene is released from the food matrix and taken up by the enterocytes.There are some/C2112023 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.This is an open access article under the CCBY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/ 4.0/).Received June 28, 2023.Accepted August 15, 2023.

Next, the uptake of b-carotene can undergo 3 main met- abolic pathways ( Shete and Quadro, 2013 ;Rodriguez- Concepcion et al., 2018 ;Bohn et al., 2019 ;Von Lintig et al., 2020 ): First, a part of b-carotene can be packaged into chylomicrons entering the bloodstream directly anddeposited in multiple tissues and organs intactly after transportation.Second, b-carotene can be cleaved sym- metrically to yield 2 molecules of retinal, this bioconver-sion process is mainly catalyzed by the key enzymeb-carotene-15,15 0-oxygenase ( BCO1 ).
As the important intermediate product of the retinoids ’metabolism, reti- nal can be reversibly reduced to retinol, then the retinolis further converted by lecithin: retinol acyl transferase(LRAT ) to retinyl esters as the main storage form and distributed in the body. Third, the b-carotene can also be asymmetrically dissociated into apocarotenoids, suchasb-apo-10 0-carotenal by the b-carotene 90,1 00-oxygen- ase (BCO2 ), which is located in mitochondria.More- over, it should be mentioned that to maintain theoptimum vitamin A status in the body and avoid hyper-vitaminosis A, there is a negative feedback control ofb-carotene bioconversion via the intestine-speci ﬁc home- odomain transcription factor ( ISX), this transcription factor activation represses the gene encoding SR-B1 andBCO1 to control the vitamin A production ( Lobo et al., 2010;Ramkumar et al., 2021 ).
Nowadays, there is still little research for the deposi- tion and bioconversion situation of b-carotene in the body of poultry. Laying hens always receive a high vita-min A level in feed under the modern culture pattern (Lima and Souza, 2018 ;Chen et al., 2022 ), therefore, the metabolic fate of b-carotene, especially whether it would be converted into vitamin A, needs to be further investi-gated.Previous research of the effects of b-carotene on vitamin A in poultry or eggs only focused on changes inretinol contents, thereby ignoring other forms of vitaminA, such as retinal and different retinyl esters ( Jiang et al., 1994 ;Heying et al., 2014 ;Díaz-G /C19omez et al., 2017a ,b).Retinol, however, did not fully re ﬂect the alteration of vitamin A status in the body after supple-mentation with b-carotene because retinyl esters as the main stable forms account for a major proportion of allvitamin A in the body ( Debelo et al., 2017 ).
Given the characteristics of b-carotene, an appropri- ate method for detecting the amounts of b-carotene and several kinds of retinoids in different samples of laying hens simultaneously was an important basis for investi- gating the deposition and bioconversion of b-carotene in laying hens. Supercritical ﬂuid chromatography ( SFC ) has been regarded as a powerful technique in recentyears for rapid and accurate analysis of carotenoids andfat-soluble vitamins ( Bernal et al., 2013 ;Pila/C20rov/C19a et al., 2019).Importantly, our previous studies have built a novel SFC-DAD-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of various carotenoids and different forms of vitamin A in egg yolk samples speci ﬁcally ( Miao et al., 2023 ), this can help us to further develop detectionmethod for serum and tissue samples.
Therefore, based on the determination method, the main objective of this study was to explore the deposition and bioconversionlaw of b-carotene in laying hens after supplementing it with different levels for the long term under adequatevitamin A status in the diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animal Ethics Statement All animal experimental procedures in this study were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Agri- cultural Sciences, Beijing, China (IAS 2021-103).Animal Treatments and Sample Collection A total of 600 Hy-line brown laying hens at 40 wk of age were randomly divided into 5 dietary treatmentswith 8 replicates of 15 birds each and managed followingthe procedures described in the Hy-line brown layinghens husbandry manual.The control group was fed a basal diet, and the ingredients and nutrient composition are shown in Table 1 .
Except the metabolizable energy and available phosphorus, the data of main nutrients infeed were all measured values. There was no b-carotene supplementation in the basal diet, and the other 4groups (BC15, BC30, BC60, and BC120) were addition-ally supplemented with 15, 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg b-car- otene powder, respectively, which was produced by Blakeslea trispora fermentation (the raw material was purchased from Wuhan Stars Modern Bio-engineeringCo., Ltd).The feeding period lasted 14 wk, and at theend of the entire experiment 1 hen was randomlyselected from each repetition for sample collection afterthe 12 h fasting period.Blood samples (10 mL) were Table 1.Ingredients and nutrient compositions of the basal diet (as-fed basis).

Egg-shell strength was measured using an eggshell strengthtester (ORKA Food Technology Ltd., Ramat HaSharon,Israel). The albumen height, Haugh unit, and Roche eggyolk color score were determined using a SONOVA egg-quality analyzer (ORKA Food Technology Ltd.).CIE- LAB values ( L*, a*, b* ) of yolk color were measured using a CR-400 (Konica Minolta Inc., Tokyo, Japan)colorimeter.Then, the egg yolk was separated andmixed to uniformity.The homogenized yolk was placedin culture dishes and freeze dried into yolk powder andstored at /C080°C until the further determination of caro- tenoids and vitamin A.Chemicals and Reagents Methanol, n-hexane, dichloromethane, isopropanol, formic acid, acetic acid, and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-phenol ( BHT ,C 15H24O) used in this study were all the chromatographic grade and obtained from Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc (Pittsburgh, PA).Ultra-pure water (18.2 M V) was obtained from a Milli-Q water puri ﬁca- tion system (Millipore, Bradford, MA).
There were 3 iso-tope internal standards used in the present study,b-carotene ( b-carotene 0,10 0,11,110-13C4), retinol (vita- min A-[19,19,19,20,20,20-d6]), and retinyl palmitate(vitamin A palmitate-[10,19,19,19-d4]). Other analytical standards such as retinal, retinyl stearate, lutein, and zeaxanthin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (StLouis, MO).Sample Preparation for Measuring Carotenoids and Vitamin A The extraction buffer and pretreatment procedure for different samples were optimized in our previousresearch ( Miao et al., 2023 ), the ﬁnal sample preparation protocol was described brie ﬂy as follows and all of the operations were protected from light: For the serum sample, 100 mL of serum was placed in a centrifuge tube, then 300 mL precooled methanol with 1% formic acid was added and mixed to precipitate pro- tein.Next, the supernatant was collected andtransferred into a new centrifuge tube and added 400 mL n-hexane which contained BHT at a concentration of 1% (w/v).
The mixed solution was centrifuged at14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C after being vortexed.Finally, 90 mL supernatant was transferred to the injec- tion vial, with 10 mL of the 3 internal standard isotope solutions at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. The mix was vortexed and injected for SFC −DAD−MS/MS analysis.For liver and ovary tissues, the sample weight to be tested was 100 mg, and the extraction solution was 1.2 mL methanol and dichloromethane (1:1, v/v) with1% (w/v) BHT.Then, the remaining steps were thesame as for serum samples.For egg yolk samples, theprocedure followed our previous research ( Miao et al., 2023).SFC−DAD−MS/MS Analysis SFC coupled with a 6465 mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) was used to analyze caro- tenoids and vitamin A in serum, tissues and egg yolks.The Agilent Mass Hunter workstation was used to runthe data acquisition and data analysis.Multiple reactionmonitoring was conducted in the positive-ion electro-spray ionization mode.
The chromatography conditions,MS parameters, and MS/MS parameters can all befound in the previous paper ( Miao et al., 2023 ). Real-Time PCR Analysis The mRNA expressions of critical genes related to the b-carotene metabolism pathway were detected using the real-time quantitative PCR.Total RNA was isolatedfrom duodenal mucosa and liver samples using theRNAprep pure tissue kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd.,Beijing, China) following the manufacturer ’s instruc- tions.Agarose gel electrophoresis and microspectropho-tometry (NanoDrop, Technologies, Wilmington, DE) were used to assess the RNA integrity and concentra- tion.cDNA was transcribed via reverse transcriptionkits (PrimeScript RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser,RR047 A, Takara, Beijing, China).The RT-PCR reac-tions were carried out using an Applied BiosystemsQuantStudio Real-Time PCR system (Thermo FisherScienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA), with SYBR Green Master Mix (TB Green Premix ExTaq, RR420 A, Takara).
Primer sequences used for analysis are presented in Table 2 . The relative fold changes of mRNA expression levels were calculated according to the 2 /C0DDCtmethod withb-actin as an internal control.Histological Analysis The ovary tissues were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, dehydrated, embedded in conventional paraf ﬁn and cut into serial sections (5 mm).Then, the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, dehydrated with an ethanol gradient, cleared with xylene, and mounted in neutral gum.We examined tissueDEDOXMETABOLISM OF BETA-CAROTENE IN LAYING HENS 3 morphology under a light microscope and used an image processing and analyzing system.The main characteris- tics of the atretic follicle are vacuolization, blurring, ordisappearance of the egg cells in the follicle and granu-losa cell degeneration.Primary follicles and secondaryfollicles are mainly judged according to the number andmorphology of granulosa cells.
The follicular atresia rateis the ratio of atresia follicles to all kinds of follicles. Redox Indicators Measurement Ovary tissues were homogenized in a 9-fold volume of pre- cooled normal saline.The homogenates were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the resultant supernatantswere collected for protein assays and measurement of redoxparameters.The protein carbonyl ( PC) was determined using commercial kits from Beijing Solarbio Science andTechnology Co., Ltd.The contents of hydrogen peroxide(H 2O2), malondialdehyde ( MDA ), glutathione ( GSH ), and the activities of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ), catalase (CAT ), and glutathione peroxidase ( GSH-Px )i nt h e ovary were measured using the kits according to the manu-facturer ’s instructions from the Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengi- neering Institute of China.
In addition, all indicators werenormalized to protein concentrations, which were measuredwith a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo FisherScienti ﬁc, San Jose, CA).Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were carried out using the SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Datawere tested for normality with the Shapiro −Wilk test, and Levene ’s test was applied to test the homogeneity of variances.One-way analysis of variance followed by Duncan ’s multiple comparison tests was further used for statistical evaluation of the results.The results areexpressed as the mean §standard error of measure- ments on samples from 8 replicates in each group set-ting, with P<0.05 being set as the criterion for statistical signi ﬁcance.
RESULTS Production Performance and Egg Quality As shown in Tables 3 and4, we found that dietary b-carotene with different levels in the diet for 14 wk had no signi ﬁcant effect on laying hens ’production perfor- mance and egg quality ( P>0.05), except for the egg yolk color. In Table 5 , the Roche egg yolk color score was improved with the laying hens uptake of b-carotene (P<0.05), but the effect was more obvious in the high- dose addition group.Additionally, the CIELAB L*color values were signi ﬁcantly decreased ( P<0.05) and CIE- LAB a*color values were extremely signi ﬁcantlyTable 2.Speci ﬁc gene primers used for real-time PCR.

The Figure S1 and S2are the chro- matographic spectra of analytes in serum and tissuesamples, which showed that the compounds under testwere separated ef ﬁciently by the SFC. Because the com- position of tissue was complex, the matrix effect wasvery large, so we focused on 3 compounds with isotopeinternal standards ( b-carotene, retinol, and retinyl pal- mitate).Furthermore, the developed method was vali- dated by determining the limit of detection ( LOD ,S/ N= 3), limit of quantitation ( LOQ ,S/N = 10), linear- ity, recovery, and repeatability.The method validationdata for the serum and tissue samples are shown in Sup- plemental Tables S1 andS2, respectively.All the results demonstrated that this method was appropriate todetect carotenoids and vitamin A in different samples.The Contents of Carotenoids and Different Forms of Vitamin A in Serum The changes of different analytes in laying hens ’ serum caused by long-term supplementation of b-caro- tene are shown in Table 6 .
The b-carotene in serum of laying hens from the control group was below the limit of quanti ﬁcation (0.5 ng/mL) of the developed detection method. The contents of the other 4 groups were allgradually increased with the supplemental dose ( P< 0.01), the highest level reached 403.35 ng/mL in theBC120 group.The levels of different forms of vitamin A,including retinal, retinol, retinyl palmitate, and retinyl stearate, were elevated compared with the control group(P<0.05).It should be noted that the data reached a peak when the supplemental level of b-carotene was 60 mg/kg (except retinal), while the supplemental levelof 120 mg/kg led to a decrease in vitamin A content.In addition, we also found zeaxanthin in serum decreased signiﬁcantly after b-carotene was supplemented in the diet for 14 wk ( P<0.05) even in the BC15 group, there was a similar trend of lutein.
The Contents of b-Carotene, Retinol, and Retinyl Palmitate in the Liver and Ovary As shown in Table 7 , the amounts of b-carotene in the BC15 and BC30 groups showed no signi ﬁcant difference, whether in the liver or the ovary, but the rate of increasewas very clear when the supplement level was above60 mg/kg ( P<0.05). For retinol, its amounts in the liver and ovary were also increased signi ﬁcantly under b-caro- tene supplementation due to the bioconversion ( P< 0.05).Moreover, the amounts of retinyl palmitate in theliver were increased gradually among groups ( P<0.05), while its contents in laying hens ’ovaries were the high- est in the BC60 group.Interestingly, under the samelevel of b-carotene addition, the deposition of b-carotene and retinol in the liver was 20 to 40 times as much asthat in the ovary.The difference in retinyl palmitate between the 2 tissues was greater, and the maximum gap could reach more than 3,000 times.
The Determined Compounds in Egg Yolks The data of each compound in egg yolks can be seen in Table 8 . The increase of b-carotene in egg yolks was not unexpected with the elevated supplemental levels ( P< 0.05), where the amounts in the 4 treatment groupswere 1.42, 1.98, 4.72, and 10.30 mg/g egg yolk.The vari- ation tendency of retinol, retinyl palmitate and retinylTable 4.Effect of dietary b-carotene supplementation on egg quality.Amount of b-carotene (mg/kg diet) Albumen height (mm) Haugh unit (HU) Eggshell strength (kg) Eggshell thickness (mm) 0 (basal diet) 6.74 §0.59 82.40 §3.48 4.18 §0.15 34.67 §0.60 15 6.75 §0.40 82.71 §2.01 4.23 §0.13 34.17 §0.31 30 6.83 §0.67 82.81 §2.62 4.21 §0.30 34.46 §0.57 60 6.81 §0.62 82.62 §2.74 4.25 §0.12 34.47 §0.21 120 6.80 §0.59 82.84 §2.93 4.31 §0.32 34.46 §0.34 Pvalue 0.9885 0.9988 0.7765 0.2254 Table 5.Effect of dietary b-carotene supplementation of egg yolk color.

The supplementation of b-carotene in feed could give rise to an increase of these 3 forms of retinoids inyolks compared with the control group ( P<0.05), but there was little difference between the group of BC60 and BC120 ( P>0.05).
Meanwhile, the enrichment con- centration of lutein and zeaxanthin in egg yolk wasmarkedly higher than b-carotene, but their amounts were also decreased in egg yolks with the deposition ofb-carotene ( P<0.05). The Change of the Relative mRNA Expressions Related to b-Carotene and Vitamin A Metabolism in Duodenal Mucosaand Liver Figure 1 shows the results of the real-time PCR analy- sis.The relative mRNA expressions of genes involved in b-carotene absorption and bioconversion in duodenal mucosa were signi ﬁcantly upregulated after long-term feeding of it (except the LRAT, with a Pvalue = 0.07), although most of them did not increase linearly withincreasing supplemental dose.In particular, the highestelevated levels of SR-B1, BCO1, and BCO2 were all inthe BC60 group, which were more than 47, 61, and 30% compared to the control group, respectively.
Further- more, there was an increased expression of ISX ( P< 0.05), this important transcription factor was upregu-lated nearly 40% in the BC30 and BC60 groups, andmore than 75% in the BC120 group, which meant acti-vation of the negative feedback for b-carotene biocon- version. In addition, the relative mRNA expressions ofBCO1 and BCO2 in the liver were also suppressed in BC120 group.The retinol-binding protein 4 ( RBP4 ) and transthyretin ( TTR ) which were mainly expressed in the liver, and are responsible for the transportation of retinol from liver to peripheral tissues, were also signi ﬁ- cantly increased after b-carotene supplementation for a long time ( P<0.05).Effects of Dietary b-Carotene on Follicular Atresia Rate The representative images of histological staining of laying hens ’ovaries in Figure 2 show that supplementa- tion with b-carotene decreased ( P<0.05) the atresia rate of the follicle, and BC60 group had the lowest atre-sia rate.
Speci ﬁcally, as shown in Figure 2 A, there were more atresia follicles in the ovary of laying hens withoutb-carotene supplementation, which are characterized by the reduction of the granulosa cell layer, the appearanceof vacuoles and the pyknosis of oocyte nuclei. With b-carotene supplementation, more complete primary and secondary follicles could be seen in the section, whilethe number of atresia follicles in laying hens ’ovaries was also decreased.Redox Indicators in the Ovary The activity of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px in the ova- ries of laying hens is shown in Figure 3 .The results indi- cate that the activity of CAT was signi ﬁcantly increased inb-carotene treatment groups ( P<0.05), but SOD and GSH-Px activity was not affected by b-carotene ( P >0.05).The contents of GSH in the ovaries of layingTable 6.Effect of dietary b-carotene with different supplemental levels on the content of carotenoids and retinoids in serum sample.

As for the oxidative stress bio- marker, H 2O2, MDA, and PCO in ovary were all decreased on account of b-carotene acting as an antioxi- dant ( P<0.05), especially when the supplement level was above 60 mg/kg. DISCUSSION Carotenoids are a group of widespread lipophilic pig- ments, which can be classi ﬁed into 2 types according to their chemical composition, one is the carotenes formedexclusively by carbon and hydrogen atoms, b-carotene is a typical representative, whereas the other is xantho- phylls containing oxygen atoms in addition to carbonand hydrogen ( Ribeiro et al., 2018 ).Traditionally, xan- thophylls such as lutein, canthaxanthin, and astaxan-thin are applied more extensively in the laying hens ’ industry than carotenes to improve yolk color and eggnutrient forti ﬁcation.This study found that dietarysupplementation with b-carotene for laying hens could also accumulate in egg yolks as well as serum and tissueswithout compromising the performance of laying hens oregg quality.
Also, the changing trend of production per-formance and egg quality indicators in each group after dietary b-carotene in laying hens ’diets for 14 wk was basically consistent with the results of feeding for 7 wk(Miao et al., 2023 ). However, compared to the previous study on astaxanthin by our group, the coloring capac-ity of b-carotene was obviously weaker than that of astaxanthin under the same deposition contents in yolks(Dansou et al., 2021 ), in which the egg yolk enrichment in astaxanthin shows obvious red color.With laying hens ingesting more b-carotene, the mRNA expression of SR-B1 and CD36 in duodenalmucosa increased signi ﬁcantly compared to the control group to promote b-carotene absorption.The deposition law of b-carotene was nearly identical in different sam- ples.With long-term and graded doses of b-carotene supplementation in laying hens ’diets the amount of it inTable 8.

In addition, the results of our study showed that the deposition of b-carotene did not reach a plateau when the supplementation level was 120 mg/kg in feed, which meant that b-carotene had the potential to accumulate further in laying hens ’bodies or eggs. Furthermore, we also found that there was to acertain extent a competitive relationship between the deposition of b-carotene and lutein or zeaxanthin in lay- ing hens ’bodies.This phenomenon has also been reported in previous studies of humans and mice ( Moll- drem et al., 2004 ;Mamatha and Baskaran, 2011 ), which could be related to competition between carotenoids formicellar incorporation in the gastrointestinal tract occurring at high-dose uptake ( Shilpa et al., 2020 ), how- ever, the detailed mechanism need further research.In addition to intact deposition, a part of b-carotene in feed could also be converted into vitamin A and Figure 2.

However, there was still anupper limit of b-carotene bioconversion when the dietary level was too high. In fact, multiple factors could modu-late provitamin A carotenoids ’absorption and biocon- version, the vitamin A intake and status was the crucial one ( Lietz et al., 2010 ;Green et al., 2021 ).It is generally believed that the provitamin A bioconversion potentialofb-carotene was higher in the case of vitamin A de ﬁ- ciency, but lower when vitamin A was in excess ( Con- dron et al., 2014 ;Harari et al., 2020 ;Green et al., 2021 ).Nowadays, synthetic retinyl esters are the main sourceof vitamin A in poultry nutrition, and the added level in the diet is usually at a high level of 8,000 to 10,000 IU/kg.This is done to maintain the vitamin Astatus in the body for improving animal immunity andalleviating stress ( Abd El-Hack et al., 2019 ;Shojadoostet al., 2021 ).
Hence, we set the content of vitamin A in the diet at 8,000 IU/kg, which could maintain an ade-quate vitamin A status for laying hens at the age of 40wk. The b-carotene had a limited bioconversion ef ﬁ- ciency in our study when the supplemental level was120 mg/kg in the diet, and ISX played an important rolein regulating SR-B1 and BCO1 for controlling the pro-duction of vitamin A.As we all know, liver is the main storage site of carote- noids and vitamin A, and hepatic stellate cells can storea large amount of vitamin A as retinyl palmitate in lipiddroplets in the cytoplasm ( Senoo et al., 2010 ;Bohn et al., 2019 ).We also found that retinyl palmitate in lay- ing hens ’livers was several orders of magnitude higher than that in other samples.In addition, the liver wereable to synthesize and secrete RBP4, which could mobi- lize the retinol from the vitamin A store, and then bind to retinol and TTR to deliver retinol to peripheral tissue(Blaner, 2019 ).
The results of increasing vitamin A in the ovaries and yolks in this research may be derivedfrom this metabolic pathway. Although only a small part of b-carotene could be con- verted in the body of laying hens under adequate vita-min A status in the diet, the deposition of b-carotene in target organs still played an important biological role, especially in the ovary.For laying hens, the state of theovarian follicle directly correlates with production per-formance, and many ovarian diseases are mainly caused Figure 4.Graphical summary of the b-carotene metabolism in laying hens ’bodies.DEDOXMETABOLISM OF BETA-CAROTENE IN LAYING HENS 9 by disorders of atrophy and atresia of ovarian follicles in most cases ( He et al., 2022 ).In our research, dietary b-carotene alleviated the follicular atresia rate compared with the control group, which was bene ﬁcial to laying hens ovarian health.
Furthermore, oxidative stress isone of the common inducing factors of follicular atresiain chickens ( Wang et al., 2021 ), whereas various kinds of carotenoids including b-carotene are thought to possess direct antioxidant activities and scavenge free radicals in animals ’bodies ( Tvrd /C19a et al., 2016 ;Rotondo Dottore et al., 2018 ;Gao et al., 2021 ;He et al., 2023a ). As such, we focus on the redox status of ovary, and the results ofimproving antioxidant capacity and decreasing oxida-tive stress biomarker were not surprising because thesupplementation of b-carotene in laying hens ’diet has been used for a long time.This is also very similar to ourgroup ’s previous study involved in the effect of astaxan- thin on follicular atresia in laying hens ( He et al., 2023b ).However, whether this antioxidant mechanism was mediated by b-carotene alone or combined with an increase in vitamin A needs further study.
In conclusion, under adequate vitamin A status in the diet, the deposition of b-carotene in laying hens ’bodies was increased gradually with the dietary b-carotene lev- els (within 120 mg/kg) after supplementing it for 14 wk, and a part of the b-carotene converted into vitamin A at the same time. Hence, the contents of different forms ofvitamin A (retinal, retinol, retinyl palmitate, and retinylstearate) were all increased, but there was still a certainupper limit of the bioconversion.Meanwhile, the absorp-tion and bioconversion of b-carotene mainly took place in the duodenum, whereas the liver is the main storagesite, in which retinyl palmitate is the main storage form.Theb-carotene deposited in the ovary after being trans- ported could show an antioxidant function, which had apositive impact on alleviating follicular atresia in layinghens.
Therefore, based on all the above results, a briefmetabolic pathway of b-carotene in laying hens body was shown in Figure 4 , and this research would provide a reference for further b-carotene application to the poultry industry.
