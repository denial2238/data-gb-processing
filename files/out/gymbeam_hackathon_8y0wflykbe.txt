The BRISC (Benefits and Risks of Iron Interventions in Children) trial compared iron supplements and MNPs with placeboin children <2 y old in rural Bangladesh. Objectives: We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of iron supplementsoriron-containingMNPsamongyoungchildreninruralBangladesh.Methods: We did a cost-effectiveness analysis of MNPs and iron supplements using the BRISC trial outcomes and resourceuse data, and programmatic data from the literature.Health care costs were assessed from a health system perspective.We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms ofUS$ per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted.To explore uncertainty, we constructed cost-effectiveness acceptability curves usingbootstrappeddataoverarangeofcost-effectivenessthresholds.
One-and2-waysensitivityanalysestestedtheimpactofvaryingkey parameter values on our results.Results: Provision of MNPs was estimated to avert 0.0031 (95% CI:0.0022,0.0041)DALYs/child,whereasironsupplementsaverted 0.0039 (95% CI: 0.0030, 0.0048) DALYs/child, over 1 y comparedwith no intervention. Incremental mean costs were $0.75 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.77) for MNPs compared with no intervention and $0.64 ($0.62, $0.67) for iron supplements compared with no intervention.Iron supplementation dominated MNPs because it was cheaper andaverted more DALYs.Iron supplementation had an ICER of $1645 ($1333, $2153) per DALY averted compared with no intervention, and had a 0% probability of being the optimal strategy at cost-effectiveness thresholds of $200 (reflecting health opportunity costs in Bangladesh) and $985 [half of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita] per DALY averted.Scenario and sensitivity analysessupported the base case findings.
Conclusions: These findings do not support universal iron supple- mentation or micronutrient powders as a cost-effective interventionfor young children in rural Bangladesh.

Systematic reviews of the effect of iron supplementation (11,12) and home fortification with MNPs ( 11,12) concluded that these interventions reduced the risk of anemia; however, whether they improved cognitive development and other func- tional outcomes in children <2 y old was uncertain ( 11–14). This is important because part of the rationale for universal iron interventions has been presumed benefit on cognitive development( 15,16).Inaddition,studieshaveindicatedthatiron interventions could increase the risk of diarrhea ( 17,18).The BRISC (Benefits and Risks of Iron Interventions in Children) trial evaluated the effect of 3 mo of iron syrups or MNPscomparedwithplaceboin8-mo-oldchildreninruralBangladesh (19,20).

Received April 13, 2022.Accepted for publication August 17, 2022.First published online October 3, 2022; doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/ ajcn/nqac225.diarrhea), providing an opportunity to use high-quality data to inform policy on iron interventions.BRISC found that although iron interventions markedly reduced the prevalence of anemia, neither iron supplements nor MNPs improved child cognitivedevelopment.Universalironinterventionsarewidelyimplemented.In2019, ≥58countriescompletedmasshomefortificationprogramswith support from UNICEF ( 21).
Economic costs of delivering this mass intervention include procuring the intervention products as well as delivering these products to beneficiaries (programdelivery costs) ( 22). To help policy makers plan interventions, it is essential to undertake cost-effectiveness analysis of these interventions to understand whether they are good value formoney.Previousanalysesadoptingdifferentanalyticapproaches have reported marked variations in the cost-effectiveness of iron supplements and MNPs ( 23–28).These variations in cost- effectiveness are likely associated with different assumptions made during the modeling process.Prospectively collected data measured from a clinical trial measuring functional clinical outcomes represent an ideal opportunity for undertaking cost-effectiveness analysis, given most prior cost-effectiveness analyses included impacts onfunctional clinical outcomes based on observational data or assumptions.
Using data from the BRISC trial, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of iron supplements and MNPs forpopulation-levelcontrolofanemiaamongyoungchildreninnon- malaria-endemic rural Bangladesh. Methods Trial study design The BRISC trial was a double-blinded placebo-controlled study that evaluated the impact of iron supplements and MNPs in young children ( 20).The trial took place in 3 administrative units (unions) of Rupganj, a rural non-malaria-endemic sub- district (Upazila) in Narayangaj District, Bangladesh.Children were screened for potential eligibility at 8 mo.Those withhemoglobin concentrations <8.0 g/dL, current febrile illness, severemalnutrition,historyofbloodtransfusion,aninheritedred cell disorder, or currently receiving iron-containing supplementswere excluded.
Children were randomly assigned to iron syrup with placebo powder, MNPs with placebo syrup, or placebo syrup and placebo powder for 3 mo (intervention period) andfollowed upfor another 9 mo(follow-up period) ( Supplemental Figure 1). Iron syrups used in the trial contained 12.5 mg Fe as ferroussulfate.MNPscontained12.5mgFeasferrousfumarate,and in addition included vitamin A, vitamin C, folic acid, and zinc.These formulations met the WHO recommendations ( 8,9).Trained village health workers (VHWs) visited children weeklyduring the intervention period and monthly during the follow-up period.This was consistent across all study arms.At the weekly visits the VHWs monitored and encouraged adherence.The primary outcome of the study was cognitive development measured using the Bayley-III Cognitive composite score (20).
Secondary outcomes included developmental (Bayley-III languageandmotor)andgrowthindexes,anemia,irondeficiency,and morbidity from infections [diarrhea (defined as ≥3 loose or liquid stools per day), respiratory infection, vomiting, and fever]. No difference in the primary outcome was observedbetween either active intervention and placebo in the trial ( 20), Cost-effectiveness of iron supplements in children 1305 thus cognitive development could not be used in assessment of outcomes for the cost-effectiveness study.The subgroup analyses suggested an increased risk of diarrhea-related clinic visits in nonanemic children during the intervention period.TheBRISC trial was prospectively registered at Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN1261700066038) and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (U1111-1196-1125).
Ethical approval for the BRISC trial was granted by Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee, Australia(HREC/16/MH/353;2016.269)andtheEthicalReviewCommittee of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (iccdr,b). Health outcomes Theoutcomeforthecost-effectivenessanalysiswasdisability- adjusted life-years (DALYs) over the trial duration of 12 mo.DALYs are calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality and the years lost due to disability(YLDs)(29,30).Becausenodifferenceinmortalitywasobserved betweenthetreatmentgroupsintheBRISCtrial( 20),YLLswere not used in the DALY estimations.
YLDs due to anemia anddiarrhea were calculated by multiplying the duration of illness with the corresponding disability weights obtained from the GlobalBurdenofDisease(GBD)study2019( 31).Thesediseases were selected because of plausibility that iron interventions could affect them ( 17), the availability of disability weights for DALYestimation,andtheirdiscussioninWHOironinterventionguidelines ( 8,9). For children with anemia who experienced diarrhea, the total YLDs were calculated by summing the YLDs from the 2 outcomes ( Supplemental Methods ).Anemia was classified into WHO-defined severity levels (nonanemia, mild anemia, moderate anemia, severe anemia) usingWHO thresholdsbasedonhemoglobinconcentration( 32).Children <5 y of age whose hemoglobin concentration is ≥110 g/L do not have anemia.
Those with hemoglobin concentration of 100–109 g/L have mild anemia, those whose hemoglobinconcentration is 70–99 g/L have moderate anemia, whereas children with hemoglobin concentration <70 g/L have severe anemia( Supplemental Table 1 ).Then,YLDswerecalculatedas theweightedaverageofdisabilityweightsbetween2timepoints multipliedbythedurationbetweenthetimepoints(Supplemental Methods). For diarrhea, cases were categorized as moderate(if they were treated in outpatient settings) or severe (if they were hospitalized) with duration of illness of 6.4 and 8.4 d, respectively, based on a systematic review ( 33).Resource use and costs For the base case analysis, costs were estimated from a health systemperspectiveandincludedthedirectcostsofprovidingthe iron intervention, program delivery costs, and unplanned healthcareuseduetodiarrhea( Table 1).Eachchildrandomlyassigned toMNPswasprovidedatotalof90sachets.Eachchildrandomly assigned to iron syrups received 15 mL weekly (195 mL over13 wk) (19).
In Bangladesh, iron syrups are available in 200- mL bottles; therefore, 1 bottle was used. It was not feasible to disentangletrialprotocol–drivencoststoobtainprogramdeliverycosts,soweusedanestimateofUS$5.80/childbasedonevidence from pilot programs from the Home Fortification TechnicalAdvisory Group (HFTAG) ( 26,34).Further details are available in the Supplemental Methods.Quantities of medications used in treating dehydration due to diarrhea were estimated using published guidelines that arefollowedinBangladesh( 35,36).Briefly,childrenhavingdiarrhea with “some dehydration” are managed with 2 packets of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and 1 blister of zinc tablets inan outpatient setting.Those who have diarrhea with “severe dehydration” are admitted to hospital and given intravenous rehydration followed by ORT with zinc on discharge fromhospital as described for “some dehydration.” Outpatient visits for “some dehydration” were measured as number of consulta- tions.
Inpatient stays (hospitalizations) for “severe dehydration”were measured using number of bed days. The numbers of consultations and bed days were obtained from BRISC trial data.Data on health care visits were collected weekly basedon previous 7 d recall by caregivers during the 3 mo of the interventionphase.Duringthesubsequent9-mopostintervention phase, these data were collected monthly based on parent orcaregiver recall for the previous 14 d.Therefore, resource use during the monthly follow-up period was proportionately extrapolatedfrom14dto1mo.Unitcostsperinpatient(hospital) bed day and per outpatient visit were from the WHO-CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective) database ( 37).All costs were reported in 2020 US$.Costs collected in non- 2020 dollars were first converted to taka of that year using World Bank–reported exchange rates ( 38).
Costs in taka were then adjusted to 2020 value using gross domestic product (GDP)d e fl a t o r sr e p o r t e db yt h eW o r l dB a n k( 39) ,a n dt h e nc o n v e r t e dt o 2020 US$ using World Bank–reported taka to dollar exchange rates (1 US$ =84.9 taka) ( 38). Discounting was not needed because a 1-y time horizon was used.Analyses WeestimatedthemeanDALYsandcostsforthe3strategies— no intervention, MNPs, and iron supplements—over 12 mo.Costs to the health system were calculated by adding the cost of active iron agents (iron syrups or MNPs), program delivery costs,andcostoftreatingdiarrhea.IncrementalcostsandDALYsaverted were calculated as the difference in respective costs and DALYs between the iron interventions and no intervention.
The incremental costs were divided by the difference in DALYs toderivetheincrementalcost-effectivenessratio(ICER),whichwas interpretedastheadditionalcostperadditionalDALYaverted.If astrategycostmoreandavertedfewerDALYsthananalternativestrategy, it would be unequivocally not cost-effective regardless of the ICER (that is, dominated by the comparator) ( 40). There were missing data for hemoglobin concentration and clinic visits.Missing hemoglobin data were assumed to be missing at random; that is, the missingness depends on observed data but not on unobserved values.These were imputed usingmultiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), stratified by treatmentgroup( 41).Fortyimputationswereperformedbecause this number was at least equal to the percentage of missingdata in the available cases ( 42).
After multiple imputation, hemoglobin values were converted into anemia categories, from which DALYs were estimated using disability weights anddurationoftimespentinanone,mild,moderate,orsevereanemic health state. The overall mean difference in DALYs between 1306 Akpan et al.

2Children with diarrhea were classified by their hydration status as severe dehydration (admitted to the hospital), some dehydration (treated at hosp ital but not admitted), or no dehydration (managed at home). 3Program delivery costs of $4.50/child were reported in the year 2013.These were adjusted using a gross domestic product deflator and exchange rate to a 2020 value of $5.80.strategies was estimated as the average of estimates from each oftheimputeddatausingRubin’srule( 43).Wedidnotadjustfor missing data on clinic visits because missing diarrhea data wereexpected to occur similarly across study arms (Supplemental Methods).To estimate the uncertainty on our ICER estimates, we conducted nonparametric bootstrapping following best practices (44).
Here, the sample data are used to provide an empirical estimateofthesamplingdistributionbyrepeatedresamplingwithreplacement.Weusedthebias-correctedandacceleratedmethod which adjusts for skewness and bias of the sampling distribution (45,46). Two thousand bootstrap replications were performed.Because DALYs were a function of imputed hemoglobin data, each resample of a missing data point was pooled from 40 multiply imputed data sets ( 46,47).The bootstrapped data were used to construct a 95% CI.The differences in mean cost between each strategy and no intervention were plotted against the associated bootstrapped differences in mean DALYs avertedon a cost-effectiveness plane.To assess uncertainty in the decision to adopt any of the 3 strategies,weconstructedacost-effectivenessacceptabilitycurve(CEAC) ( 44).For each bootstrap resample, the net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated using the formula NMB = (−DALY ×Threshold) −Cost.
Within each resample and cost per DALY averted threshold, the strategy with the highest NMB wasselected.Overallreplications,theprobabilitythatastrategy has the highest NMB is the proportion of bootstrap replicatesthat yields the highest NMB. We then plotted this probability againstrangesofcostperDALYavertedthresholds.Twodecision thresholds were used as reference in interpreting ICERs andthe CEAC.These were $200 (representing an approximate average of 2 modeled health opportunity costs for Bangladesh) (48,49) and $985 (half of GDP per capita of Bangladesh in 2020) (50).We conducted 3 scenario analyses.In the first scenario, we used only participants with hemoglobin measurementsat all time points (complete cases) for DALY calculations,instead of multiply imputed data used in the base case.In the second scenario we adopted a societal perspective instead of the health system perspective used in the base case, byincorporating household out-of-pocket costs and productivity losses.
The Supplemental Methods provide details of the procedure for estimating out-of-pocket costs and productiv-ity losses. In the third scenario, we used data from the first scenario (complete cases) and extended the estimated intervention benefits beyond the 12-mo trial follow-up pe-riod by 3 additional months (to the target population age cutoff of 23 mo).During these 3 mo, we assumed those in the active iron groups would have the same hemoglobinconcentrations as they did at the end of the trial follow-up period.A 1-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the impact of input values on the ICER.Low and high values were takenfrom95%uncertaintyintervalswhenavailable.Wedidnot find CIs on cost of active iron agents and program management,so we adopted a cautious approach by using a wide range: 50% in either direction.A 2-way sensitivity analysis explored the impact of simultaneously varying costs of active iron agents andprogram delivery.
To implement this, we extracted DALYs from 5 out of the 40 imputations used in the base case (to reduce computation time). Then, we estimated the probability of cost-effectiveness at our decision thresholds of $200 and $985 over plausiblecombinationsofthe2costparameters,startingfrom$0 with $0.10 increments.The probability was defined as a 1-sidedPvaluefromregressionoftheirNMBwithtreatmentgroupsasa covariate ( 51,52).Separate sensitivity analyses were conducted using the 2 thresholds.A final sensitivity analysis explored, under very optimistic scenarios, what program delivery costs will achieve ≥50% probability of cost-effectiveness.A combination of assumptionsmade this scenario very optimistic.First, we used only data on participants with complete cases (scenario 1).Second, we assumed the estimated intervention benefits beyond the trialfollow-up period would last 3 additional months (scenario 3).

The proportion of children who consumed ≤70% of their assigned intervention was similar in the 2 active ironinterventiongroups(MNParm:70.8%;ironsupplementation arm:70.4%).Childrenwithcompletehemoglobinmeasurementswere more likely to adhere to the intervention for ≥70% of their assigned active iron agent than were those with incomplete data: 82.2% compared with 61.0% in the MNP group and82.2% compared with 60.1% in the iron supplementation group (Supplemental Table 2 ). Costs and cost-effectiveness Overall, the numbers of unplanned visits to outpatient departments and hospitalizations due to diarrhea were similar in the 3 treatment arms ( Table 3).The mean ±SD cost per child to the health care system was $0.62 ±$2.57 for no intervention, $8.12 ±$2.94 for MNPs, and $7.06 ±$2.58 for iron supplementation ( Table 4).
Because the program delivery costs for MNP home fortification andiron supplementation programs were assumed to be the same, differencesincostsbetweentheactiveironstrategiesweredriven by the cost of the intervention products ($1.60 for MNPs and $0.63 for syrups). No meaningful difference in out-of-pocketcosts and costs due to lost productivity was observed across the 3 treatment arms ( Table 4).Table 5 presents the mean costs and cost-effectiveness results per child for the 3 strategies.MNPs were estimated to cost $7.50 (95% CI: $7.27, $7.72) more than no intervention while averting 0.0031 (95% CI: 0.0022, 0.0041) DALYs.Ironsupplementation was estimated to cost, on average, $6.44 (95% CI: $6.22, $6.67) higher than no intervention while averting 0.0039 (95% CI: 0.0030, 0.0048) DALYs.This yields an ICERof $1645 (95% CI: $1333, $2153) per DALY averted for iron supplementation compared with no intervention.
Iron supple- mentation saved $1.06 (95% CI: $0.81, $1.28) compared withMNPs ( Supplemental Table 3 ). Therefore, iron supplements dominated MNPs, and the cost-effectiveness plane for MNPs compared with iron supplementation shows this ( Supplemental Figure 2) The incremental cost-effectiveness plane of bootstrapped replicates using the base case analysis showed that at $200 and$985 per DALY averted, it was unlikely that either MNPs or iron supplementation would be cost-effective ( Supplemental Figure 3).The CEAC ( Figure 1) showed that at thresholds of $200 and $985, neither MNPs nor iron supplements had the highestNMBinanyofthe2000bootstrapresamples(thatis,0% probabilityofcost-effectiveness).Atahigherthresholdof$1970(GDPpercapitaofBangladeshin2020),theprobabilitythatiron 1308 Akpan et al.

2The reason for health care visits was collected for 67% of all visits during the intervention and for 95% of the trial population during the follow-up period. Visits due to diarrhea are classified using the hydration status of the child into diarrhea with severe dehydration (if the child was admitted t ot h e hospital) or diarrhea with some dehydration (if the child was treated as an outpatient).3Number of cases of diarrhea with “some dehydration” was used as a proxy for number of outpatient visits, as per guidelines for diarrhea treatment followed in Bangladesh.4Using treatment guidelines, a child having diarrhea with “severe dehydration” is admitted to the hospital.Because a child can spend >1 night at the hospital, the total number of inpatient bed days is higher than the number of cases of diarrhea with “severe dehydration.” supplementation is a cost-effective strategy was >95%, whereas MNPs remained not cost-effective.
Scenario and sensitivity analyses In the first scenario, when we restricted the analysis to only participants with complete hemoglobin data, the ICER for iron supplements compared with no intervention ($1011; 95% CI: $802, $1350 per DALY averted) was slightly lower than whenusing imputed values ($1645; 95% CI: $1333, $2153 per DALY averted) ( Supplemental Table 4 ). In the second scenario, where we compared the societal perspective to the base case healthsystem perspective, the cost and cost-effectiveness results weresimilar(SupplementalTable4).Thissimilaritywasbecausetherewasnodifferenceinhealthcareutilizationbetweenthetreatment arms, so out-of-pocket costs and productivity losses were thesame for the treatment groups ( Table 4).In the third scenario, whereweextrapolatedtheeffectsoftheironinterventionsbeyond trial follow-up, iron supplements cost $817 (95% CI: $648,$1109) per DALY averted (Supplemental Table 4).
In all 3 scenarios, MNPs remained dominated by iron supplementation (that is, more costly and less effective).

The curve shows the probability that no intervention, MNPs, or iron supplements is cost-effective for an amount a decision maker is willing to pay to avert a DALY. Dashed lines indicate 3 such thresholds: $200, $985 (half the GDP per capita of Bangladesh in 2020), and $1970 (GDP percapita of Bangladesh in 2020).DALY, disability-adjusted life-year; GDP, gross domestic product; MNP, multiple micronutrient powder.delivery and cost of active iron interventions would make either iron supplements or MNPs optimal with ≥50% probability (Figure 2).At a threshold ceiling of $200 per DALY averted, neither intervention was cost-effective at any program deliverycost.At$985(halfGDPpercapita),theinterventionswouldhave ≥50% probability of being cost-effective if program delivery costs were <$1.50/child (for MNPs) or <$3.50/child (for iron supplements).These are well below the base case program deliverycostsof$5.80(in 2020prices).
Supplemental Figure 5 presents a 2-way sensitivity analysis at $1970 (GDP per capita). Finally, under very optimistic scenarios, our threshold sen- sitivity analysis suggests program delivery costs must be<$5.60/child for iron supplements to have ≥50% probability of being cost-effective ( Supplemental Figure 6 ).In comparison, the base case cost was $5.80/child.This result represents a best-case scenario—the adherence in the complete casesdata was >80%, we used a threshold ($985) higher than empirical estimates of health opportunity costs in Bangladesh, and we assumed sustained benefits of iron beyond the trialfollow-up.

To our knowledge, this is the first study using robust data froma randomized controlled trial rather than observational data, and thus our findings offer important insights into the expected value for money of iron interventions in other non-malaria-endemicsettings.Ourfindingsshowthatneitherinterventionwas cost-effective at cost-effectiveness thresholds of $200 and $985 (half GDP per capita of Bangladesh in 2020). The probabilitythat MNPs are cost-effective was 0% at any cost-effectiveness threshold.If the threshold were raised to 1 GDP per capita for Bangladesh ($1970), then iron supplementation would becost-effective; however, this threshold is likely to be unrealistic for many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) ( 53).Our conclusions remained robust to various sensitivity and scenarioanalyses; specifically, program delivery costs would need to be very low to render these interventions cost-effective.
TheBRISC trial was the firstrandomized controlled trial with longenoughfollow-uptohavethepotentialtoshowasubstantial difference in cognitive development outcomes; however, nodifferences in cognitive scores or reports of diarrhea and other infections were observed between the treatment groups ( 20). Accordingly, we did not include the effects of iron supplements or MNPs on cognitive development in the cost-effectiveness analysis.Previous studies that reported that MNPs were goodvalue for money used averted productivity losses from improved cognition as a health outcome, imputed from observational studies or non-empiric estimates ( 23,24,28).However, both the BRISC trial ( 20) and previous systematic reviews identified no effect of both interventions on cognition in children aged 6–23 mo ( 13,14).Our findings indicate the value of using empiric data to justify effect sizes for key outcomes in economic analyses.
Twostrengthsofthisstudywereusingdatafromarandomized clinical trial with a large sample size and the use of advanced statistical methods to capture uncertainty. The sample size was large enough to detect slight differences in functionaloutcomes, hemoglobin concentrations, and diarrheal episodes between the groups.Missing data on hemoglobin concentration Cost-effectiveness of iron supplements in children 1311 were handled using multiple imputation.Adherence data were complete, enabling this variable to be used in the imputation model with higher accuracy for the values generated.By combining imputation with nonparametric bootstrapping, theanalysis captured the uncertainty surrounding the ICER in the presence of missing data.ThisstudyobtainedcostsofironsupplementsandMNPsfrom localmanufacturersandthenexploredtheimpactofvaryingcost parametersonoverallcost-effectiveness.Thepriceper90sachets of MNP used was $1.60.
In comparison, UNICEF supplied thesamequantityofMNPsat$1.65for3boxes(90sachets)perchild between 2015 and 2020 ( 21). Therefore, the costs of MNP used intheBRISCtrialreflectedglobalprices.Weassumedthateitherintervention (syrup or MNP) would require a similar intensity of program delivery activities primarily intended to encourage adherence.Nevertheless, we varied the cost of active iron agents(syrups or MNPs) and program delivery in a 2-way sensitivity analysis.Our results showed that, using a threshold of 0.5 × GDP per capita and cost of iron syrups at $0.63/child, programdelivery costs will need to be as low as $3.50 ·child −1·y−1in 2020 prices for iron supplementation to be cost-effective.In a very optimistic scenario, the minimum program delivery costsfor cost-effectiveness were $3.25 for MNPs and $5.60 for iron supplements.
Comparing with costs reported in pilot programs (22,34), keeping program delivery costs below these amounts without affecting adherence, coverage, and ultimately DALYs averted could be difficult. One strategy to reduce the cost of delivering MNP programs is to utilize personnel and resourcesof existing Infant and Young Child Feeding interventions(54).We used 2 reasonable cost-effectiveness thresholds for Bangladesh: $200 and $985 (half GDP per capita in 2020)(48,49).A 2017 ranking of publicly funded health interventions in LMICs found more than half of interventions had an ICER <$200 per DALY averted ( 55).Previous studies have estimated the threshold in Bangladesh to be $150 per DALY averted (49) and $230 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (48).
Half GDP per capita was used because it has been suggested as an appropriate measure of health opportunity costs inLMICs( 53).OurresultsindicatetheICERof$1645perDALY averted for iron supplements (which dominate MNPs) was wellabove these decision thresholds. The approach taken to capture the intervention benefits in terms of DALYs averted through reductions in anemia does not incorporate potential benefits ofMNPs due to the other micronutrients provided.However, the BRISC trial did not find differential effects between MNPs and ironsupplementsforoutcomespotentiallyassociatedwithaddedmicronutrients such as corneal lesions (vitamin A), stunting (zinc), and diarrhea (zinc) ( 20).Therefore, capturing effects of other micronutrients provided is unlikely to change our findingsthat neither MNPs nor iron supplements are likely to be cost- effective in this rural Bangladeshi setting, and possibly other LMICs where epidemiology of anemia and diarrhea, and healthcare costs are similar.
Our study included all cost components relevant to estimating the total costs of iron interventions. The BRISC trial collecteddata on health care utilization in the form of number of unplanned visits; we then used guidelines to guide assumptions onestimatingprovidercosts.Collectingdetailedcostdatawouldnot have provided information on variation across providersthat may have occurred if the intervention had been carried out in a real-world setting because caregivers were encouraged to visit a trial pediatrician when necessary.Our base case analysis used a limited health system perspective, so direct nonmedicalcosts (such as transportation) borne by households and indirect costs due to lost productivity were excluded.We did not expect that either of these 2 limitations would have an impact on ourbase case results given there was no meaningful difference in unplanned medical visits due to diarrhea between the groups.
Because of data limitations, we opted to use GDP per capitaper day to estimate productivity losses. Although this may overestimate the true productivity losses, the overestimation is minimal because of the short time frame of our study and lownumber of lost hours due to illness from diarrhea.Our scenario analysis using a societal perspective showed comparable results with the base case.A limitation in this study is that results are only valid for a 1-y time horizon.Extrapolating beyond this horizon could reduce the ICER because, at the end of the follow-up periodof the trial, children who had received an iron intervention still had≥20% reduction in anemia prevalence ( 20).However, it is unclear how long these benefits will last, so estimating theDALYs averted over an extended period would be problematic.
In a scenario analysis where we assumed iron interventions had sustained benefits on anemia for an additional 3 mo, the ICERfor iron supplements ($807/DALY averted) compared with no intervention became lower than half of GDP per capita. Another limitation was that we calculated anemia and diarrhea comorbidYLDs using an additive method.Although this is not ideal, itwould have a minor impact on results owing to the short nature of diarrhea episodes.Finally, because the trial protocol included weekly visits by VHWs intended to encourage adherence, theresults seen in the trial are likely to be more optimal than in real life, leading us to underestimate the calculated ICER.The WHO recommends universal provision of iron inter- ventions to reduce the prevalence of anemia in children <2 y old.However, with ICERs >$1000 per DALY averted, universal iron interventions do not appear cost-effective inthis rural Bangladeshi setting.
Iron supplements could become cost-effective under very optimistic scenarios and at program delivery costs <$5.60/child. These findings have important implications for policy and funding decisions for nutrition programs across LMICs.Further research should investigate whether these results hold in other settings, for example, inmalaria-endemic areas, and evaluate whether other interven- tions, such as iron supplementation during pregnancy, could offer solutions to reduce the impact of anemia in youngchildren.
