Abstract: Placental extract has been used for skin care and delaying skin aging.Cow placenta is an abundant resource with a large mass, which has not been harnessed effectively.
Cow placenta extract (CPE) has the functions of antioxidation, anti-inﬂammatory, promoting growth and development, and promoting hair growth. However, little is known about the effect of oral administration of cow placenta extract on skin conditions.Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the antioxidant capacity of CPE in vitro and in vivo and its protective effect on d-galactose (D-gal) induced skin aging in mice.The results showed that CPE had strong free radical scavenging, reducing and metal chelating activities.CPE can increase the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the content of glutathione (GSH), decrease the content of malondialdehyde (MDA).
Moreover, CPE can decrease the gene and protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1a (MMP-1a) and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) and increase the expression of transforming growth factor- β(TGF- β) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) of mouse skin. Histopathological analysis showed CPE reduced the collagen damage caused by D-gal, increased collagen synthesis and reduced its degradation to delay skin aging.Keywords: cow; placenta; D-galactose; antioxidant; skin aging 1.Introduction The skin is the largest organ by surface area in the human body and acts as the primor- dial barrier of the organism against the outside environment, which exerts multiple key functions, including protection, immune response and neuroendocrine [ 1].With increasing age, the skin develops visible signs of aging, presenting skin elasticity deteriorated, hydra- tion weakened, transepidermal water loss increased, and collagen content decreased [ 2].
Therefore, that knowledge in preventing aging is, in general, of high importance, where ﬁnding new products and using already available sources may provide good research in this area. Studies have reported that human placenta and porcine placenta extract have good skin care and antidermal-aging effects [ 3,4].Cow placenta contains multiple biologi- cally active substances such as amino acids, trace elements, hormones, and cytokines.At present, we have used liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS)/mass spectrome- ter (MS) to analyze the differences in antioxidant activity of cow placenta extract (CPE) by different proteases, and investigated the bioactive polypeptides of dairy cows’ placenta and established an effective enzymatic hydrolysis evaluation index for preparing bioactive hydrolysates [5,6].These results suggest that CPE has a strong anti-aging potential.Currently, there are some reports on oral intake of anti-aging drugs.
Oral intake of porcine placenta extract can improve human skin quality and increase skin elasticity, hydra- tion and barrier function [ 3]. Oral intake of chicken bone collagen peptides anti-skin aging Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4659.https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14214659 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4659 2 of 13 in mice by regulating collagen degradation and synthesis, inhibiting inﬂammation and acti- vating lysosomes [ 7].In addition, studies have evidenced that the main bioactive substances of placenta extract are polypeptides, which have favorable antioxidant activity [ 8–10].Ox- idative damage is the main contributor to skin aging processes.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the primary cause of oxidative damage and plays an essential role in skin aging.
ROS can damage DNA and RNA, resulting in reduced translation efﬁciency and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, which in turn causes abnormal collagen and elastin synthesis, eventually leading to skin aging [ 11,12]. Therefore, exploring interventions to improve antioxidant capacity can effectively prevent skin aging.D-galactose (D-gal) is a powerful glycosylation agent which can destroy elastin and collagen, the major structural molecules of the skin [ 13,14], cause oxidative stress, disturb redox homeostasis, and ultimately lead to the induction of severe oxidative damage [ 14,15].Therefore, D-gal-treated mice are widely considered an ideal animal model for studying oxidative damage and skin aging.Therefore, this study determined the free radical scavenging power, reducing power and metal chelating power of CPE by 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid; ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and Ferrozine methods.
Further, we clariﬁed the antioxidant activity and anti-aging effects of CPE in the D-gal-induced mouse model by detecting serum antioxidant indexes, histopathological skin changes, aging-related genes and protein levels. 2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Placenta Collection and CPE Preparation Fresh placenta of normally parturated, healthy Holstein cows, aged 3–5 years, weigh- ing above 600 kg and parity 2–4, was collected from a dairy farm in Sichuan Province, China.Then immediately washed with normal saline to remove residual blood and dirt in the placenta and stored at −20◦C.Preparation of CPE according to our previous method [ 6].The placenta was thawed at room temperature and minced.Then, the placenta was homogenized in deionized water by a homogenizer (FSH 2A homogenizer; Yuexin, China) in an ice bath to obtain placenta homogenate.
Next, hydrolyzed placenta homogenate by papain (800 U/mg, Shanghai Yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) at neutral pH and 55◦C with 35.74% substrate concentration and 3.92% enzyme-substrate ratio for 5.49 h. Inactivate papain at 90◦C for 10 min, then centrifuged (5427 R centrifuge, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) the solution at 9200×gfor 5 min and collected the supernatant.Finally, the supernatant was freeze-dried for 48 h to prepare CPE (LyoQuest-55, Telstar, Terrassa, Barcelona).2.2.Antioxidant Capacity In Vitro 0.1 g CPE was dissolved in 1 mL sterile deionized water and diluted to 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg/mL for further experiments.2.2.1.ABTS Radical Scavenging Activity Diammonium 2,2′-azinobis[3-ethyl-2,3-dihydrobenzothiazole-6-sulphonate (ABTS) kit was purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology (S0119, Nantong, China).ABTS radical scavenging activity was assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.2.2.2.
Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) FRAP kit was purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology (S0116, Nantong, China). FRAP radical scavenging activity was assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.2.2.3.Metal Chelating Ability The metal chelating ability of CPE was assayed according to the method of Noon et al.[ 16].Ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4) (10 µL 4 mmol/L) was added into 0.5 mL CPE solution and reacted for 3 min at room temperature.Ferrozine (10 µL of 20 mmol/L) was Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4659 3 of 13 then added and reacted for 10 min in darkness.Finally, absorbance (A) was measured at 562 nm.Results were expressed as the Ferrozine inhibition rate (%).Ferrozine inhibition rate (%) =Acontrol−Asample Acontrol×100% (1) 2.3.
Animals and Treatment Forty 8-week-old clean-grade Kunming mice were fed under standard conditions for 1 week with food and water available ad libitum, then randomly divided into four groups, 10 mice/group ( n= 10): negative control group (group NC), model group (group M), treatment group (group CPE) and positive control group (group VC). Group M, CPE and VC were injected intraperitoneally with D-gal, 500 mg/kg/day, and the NC group was injected intraperitoneally with an equal amount of saline.Group CPE was gavaged with CPE, 2000 mg/kg/day; group VC was gavaged with vitamin C (Vit C), 100 mg/kg/day; group NC and M were gavaged with equal amounts of distilled water, respectively.The body weight of mice was measured weekly to adjust the injection dose.After 8 weeks of continuous treatment, they were given 3 days to recover.
Criteria for successful modeling: Mice showed numbness, mental inactivity, unre- sponsiveness, rough hair, skin thinning, laxity and weight loss; skin sections showed a signiﬁcant decrease in skin thickness and dermal layer thickness. 2.4.Serum and Tissue Preparation At the end of restorative feeding, the blood samples were collected by enucleation of the mice’s eyes and sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation immediately.Two samples of 1 cm×1 cm depilated skin tissue were collected from the back, one sample was ﬁxed in 4 %paraformaldehyde, and the other sample was stored at −80◦C.Blood was placed in a centrifuge tube without anticoagulant, stood for 30 min, then centrifuged at 9200 ×gfor 5 min to separate the serum, and the serum was collected and stored at −80◦C.2.5.
Oxidation-Associated Biomarkers Determination in Mouse Serum The activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the content of glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) in mouse serum were determined by relative kits (purchased from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) as reference. 2.6.HE and Masson Stain of Mouse Skin Fixed skin tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, then embedded in parafﬁn.For hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, skins were sliced into 5 µm, dehydrated with gradient ethanol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Masson staining: stained skins in hema- toxylin for 2–5 min, washed with water, differentiated with hydrochloric alcohol, blued with ammonia water, and rinsed with running water; stained in 1% phosphomolybdic acid for 1–2 min, controlled time under the microscope to see red muscle ﬁbers and light red collagen ﬁbers; stained directly into aniline blue staining solution for 2–5 min. Dried in a 60◦C oven, cleared with xylene, and sealed with neutral resin.2.7.MMP-1a, MMP-3, TIMP-1 and TGF- βProtein Expression in Mouse Skin Added skin tissue and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in a tissue grinding tube at a ratio of 1:9 and homogenized thoroughly until no visible tissue debris remained.The tube was centrifuged at 4600 ×gfor 20 min.Finally, the supernatant was collected and used for further analysis.The ELISA kits were purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China ).
The level of matrix metalloproteinase 1a (MMP-1a), matrix metallopro- teinase 3 (MMP-3), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), and transforming growth factor- β(TGF- β) in skin tissue were measured according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, samples and standards were added to the 96-well plates, and biotin Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4659 4 of 13 antigen was added and reacted at 37◦C for 30 min.The plate was washed 5 times and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugate and reacted at 37◦C for 30 min.The plate was washed 5 times, and Chromogen solutions A and B were added and incu- bated at 37◦C for 10 min in darkness.Finally, a stop solution was added to each well, and after 10 min, the optical density at 450 nm was measured.The standard curve regression equation was calculated by ELISA Calc software according to the standard concentration and optical density (OD) value, and curve ﬁtting was performed using four-parameter logistic regression.2.8.

These determine the potential of CPE as a natural antioxidant. In addition, we also compared the antioxidant activity and Vit C equivalent of different enzymatic hydrolys ates and obtained the optimal extraction method, which provided theoretical support for this study [20].The peptides obtained from goat placenta have a good scavenging effect on 2,2-di- phenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals in a concentration-dependent manner [8].Porcine placenta hydrolysate had an excellent reducing capacity, metal chelating ability and higher DPPH and ABTS inhibitory activities [21].The results of this study indicated that the ABTS radical scavenging power of CPE is 19.56 μmol/g, the FRAP reducing the power of CPE is 43.62 μmol/g, and the Ferrozine inhibiti on rate of 50 mg/mL CPE can reach 72.60%.In conclusion, CPE has good anti oxidant activity in vitro.However, the in vitro antioxidant activity of CPE prepared in this study was weaker than that of the above placenta extract.
We speculate that CPE was prepared by enzymatic digestion of papain in this study, so it contains a variety of peptides of unequal length and has a large molec-ular weight. In contrast, most of the placental peptides reported in the data were prepared Figure 7.MMP-1a, MMP-3, TIMP-1 and TGF- βlevels in mice skin.Note: ( A): MMP-1a content in mouse skin tissue; ( B): MMP-3 content in mouse skin tissue; ( C): TGF- βcontent in mouse skin tissue; ( D): TIMP-1 content in mouse skin tissue.“*” indicated that the date had statistically significant differences ( p< 0.05) compared with group NC.“#” and “##” indi- cated that the date had statistically significant differences ( p< 0.05) and extremely significant (p< 0.01) compared with group M, respectively .Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4659 9 of 13 4.Discussion 4.1.
Antioxidant Activity of CPE In Vitro Studies have conﬁrmed that the placenta has strong antioxidant activity, and its main antioxidant components include uracil, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, collagen in human placenta [ 17–19], water-soluble protein in the porcine placenta [ 10], and polypeptide in goat placenta [ 8]. The dairy cow placenta has great similarities with other mammals and the human placenta, but there are few reports on its research.We have used LC-MS/Ms technology to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the enzymatic hydrolysates of dairy cows.The main components are peptides with antioxidant capacity, which contain leucine, lysine, isoleucine and arginine [ 5].These determine the potential of CPE as a natural antioxidant.In addition, we also compared the antioxidant activity and Vit C equivalent of different enzymatic hydrolysates and obtained the optimal extraction method, which provided theoretical support for this study [20].
The peptides obtained from goat placenta have a good scavenging effect on 2,2- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals in a concentration-dependent manner [ 8]. Porcine placenta hydrolysate had an excellent reducing capacity, metal chelating ability and higher DPPH and ABTS inhibitory activities [ 21].The results of this study indicated that the ABTS radical scavenging power of CPE is 19.56 µmol/g, the FRAP reducing the power of CPE is 43.62 µmol/g, and the Ferrozine inhibition rate of 50 mg/mL CPE can reach 72.60%.In conclusion, CPE has good antioxidant activity in vitro .However, the in vitro antioxidant activity of CPE prepared in this study was weaker than that of the above placenta extract.We speculate that CPE was prepared by enzymatic digestion of papain in this study, so it contains a variety of peptides of unequal length and has a large molecular weight.
In contrast, most of the placental peptides reported in the data were prepared by puriﬁcation methods such as ultraﬁltration or chromatographic separation and have a small molecular weight. However, peptides with smaller molecular weights have higher antioxidant activity [ 22,23], so the antioxidant activity of CPE is slightly inferior to other animal placental peptides.4.2.Effect of CPE on the Body Weight of Mice As age increases, the decreasing physiological functions will ﬁnally lead to weight loss [ 24].Studies showed that the weight gain in D-gal-induced aging mice was signiﬁcantly lower than that in healthy mice [ 25,26].Our study showed that weight gain in D-gal- induced aging mice began to slow down from week 3 and was signiﬁcantly lower than that in healthy mice at week 4–8, which was consistent with the above results.The weight gain in Vit C-treated mice was similar to that in healthy mice, indicating that Vit C could delay the weight loss caused by D-gal.
Moreover, as shown in Figure 2, the body weight gain of mice in CPE-treated was higher than that in Vit C-treated mice and healthy mice, and the ﬁnal weight was signiﬁcantly higher than that of D-gal-treated mice ( p< 0.05). Bioactive peptides play an important nutritional role, have a positive impact on changes in body composition and muscular performance, and can reduce muscle damage following exercise [ 27].Our study showed that CPE could improve the weight loss induced by D-gal, exert beneﬁcial health effects, and has signiﬁcant potential as a nutritional supplement.4.3.Effect of CPE on Serum Antioxidant Indexes and in Mice MDA is the product of membrane peroxidation and is considered an indicator of lipid peroxidation and membrane damage [ 27].In contrast, GSH, GSH-Px, POD and SOD protect host cells from oxidative damage by scavenging free radicals in vivo [28].
Research data have demonstrated that there was a signiﬁcant decrease in GSH, SOD and CAT in serum, heart, liver, lungs, kidney and brain tissues during D-gal-induced aging, a signiﬁcant increase in MDA and an increase in oxidative damage in the organism [ 25,29,30]. The results of this study demonstrated that serum CAT, GSH-Px, POD, SOD and GSH were signiﬁcantly decreased ( p< 0.05) or extremely signiﬁcantly decreased ( p< 0.01), and MDA was highly signiﬁcantly increased ( p< 0.01) in D-gal-treated mice compared to healthy Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4659 10 of 13 mice, indicating that D-gal had destroyed the redox homeostasis and was consistent with the above ﬁndings.Carnosine and taurine treatments decreased MDA and protein carbonyl levels and elevated GSH levels, SOD and GSH-Px activities ameliorated histopathological ﬁndings in the livers of D-gal-treated rats, which exerts protective actions [ 31].
The administration of ﬁbroblast growth factor or l-Theanine signiﬁcantly alleviated histological lesions induced by D-gal and suppressed profound elevation of ROS production and oxidative stress by reducing MDA and GSH levels and restoring SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities in the liver [ 32,33]. Tilapia skin collagen polypeptide could alleviate d-gal-induced histopatho- logical impairments to the liver and kidneys.Moreover, it improved the activities of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px, and inhibited the increases in MDA [ 26].Our study showed that CPE and Vit C signiﬁcantly increased CAT, GSH-Px, POD, SOD activities and GSH levels (p< 0.01) and signiﬁcantly decreased MDA levels ( p< 0.01) compared to D-gal-induced model mice.These ﬁndings suggested that CPE has a similar effect to Vit C in regulating the redox balance of D-gal-induced aging mice by restoring antioxidant enzyme activity and reducing peroxidation.4.4.
Effect of CPE on Skin Aging-Related Markers in Mice With aging, skin collagen and elastin will perform characteristic changes that indicate skin aging, such as collagen ﬁber thinning, crosslinking, breaking, elastin deposition etc. In addition, decreased collagen and elastin synthesis can lead to decreased skin elasticity and increased wrinkles, showing typical skin aging symptoms [ 13].Therefore, collagen and elastin are important indicators for studying skin aging.This study showed that the epidermal structure of D-gal-treated mice was damaged, and the number of hair follicles decreased.The thickness of the dermis and the area of collagen ﬁbers in D-gal-treated mice were signiﬁcantly lower than those in healthy mice ( p< 0.05), which was consistent with the results of Jiming Chen and Zejun Zhang, indicating that D-gal damaged the skin structure of mice and caused pathological changes similar to skin aging [ 34,35].
Oral intake of porcine placenta extract can improve human skin quality and increase skin elasticity, hydration and barrier functions [ 3]. Oral intake of chicken bone collagen peptides can improve the condition of aging skin in mice, including maintaining a smooth, orderly, and complete structure and increasing the dermal thickness and collagen content [ 7].Our results showed that the skin structure of CPE mice was similar to that in healthy mice, and no obvious pathological damage was found.The thickness of the dermis and the area of collagen ﬁbers in CPE mice were signiﬁcantly higher than those in D-gal model mice.MMP-1 and MMP-3 are interstitial collagenases that degrade type I collagen and type III collagen, which are the most abundant collagen in the skin [ 36].In addition, MMP-3 can extensively degrade extracellular matrix and activate other MMPs [ 37].The increase of MMP-1 and MMP-3 leads to excessive degradation of collagen, which is an essential factor leading to skin aging.
TIMP is an endogenous inhibitor of MMPs, so it is a critical regulator of the extracellular matrix. TIMP-1 is an inhibitor of MMP-1, can promote the growth of keratinocytes and ﬁbroblasts, and plays a vital role in skin aging [ 38].TGF- βis a potent growth factor that controls the expression, deposition and turnover of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins in the skin [ 36], which can induce paracrine and autocrine signal pathways at transcriptional and translational levels, as well as the expression of other growth factors.The inhibition of the pathway controlled by TGF- βleads to a decrease in collagen synthesis.
Our study showed that MMP-1a and MMP-3 expression were increased, TGF- βand TIMP-1 were decreased in D-gal treated mice compared with healthy mice, which indicated that D-gal could promote skin aging by increasing the level of MMPs, decreasing the level of TIMP-1 and TGF- β, and regulating the synthesis and degradation of collagen, which is consistent with the results of Andres and Zhang Xie [ 39,40]. Conversely, compared with D-gal treated mice, the gene and protein expression of MMP-1a and MMP-3 were signiﬁcantly decreased ( p< 0.05) or extremely signiﬁcantly decreased ( p< 0.01), the expression of the TGF- βgene was signiﬁcantly increased ( p< 0.01), and the content was Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4659 11 of 13 increased, but not signiﬁcantly ( p> 0.05) in CPE treated mice.In addition, the expression and content of TIMP-1 were signiﬁcantly increased ( p< 0.05).The above results were similar to those of Vit C-treated mice.
In summary, CPE can promote collagen synthesis and reduce collagen degradation, thereby alleviating skin damage caused by D-gal, and the effect is equivalent to Vit C. 5.Conclusions In this present study, we evaluate the antioxidant activity of CPE in vivo and in vitro and its anti-aging activity based on the mouse skin aging model induced by D-gal.In vitro , CPE has a strong free radical scavenging ability, reducing power and metal chelating ability.In vivo , it can enhance the antioxidant enzyme activities, including CAT, GSH-Px, POD and SOD in mouse serum, increase GSH level, and reduce MDA content.Furthermore, it can improve the histological damage of skin induced by D-gal, reduce the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3, increase the expression of TGF- βand TIMP-1, and then regulate the production and degradation of collagen to delay skin aging.
This study provides a theoretical basis for implementing cow placenta extract to alleviate skin aging and broaden the scope for the comprehensive utilization of animal by-products in functional foods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to clinically evaluate the effect of oral intake of cow placenta extract on skin conditions.This study has a few limitations.We need to detect more skin health-related biomarkers and further study the mechanism of CPE delaying skin aging to comprehensively evaluate the beneﬁcial effects of CPE, but we can speculate that CPE alleviates skin aging by regulating antioxidant signaling pathways and collagen production pathways.For prospects, we will further study the molecular mechanism of CPE anti-aging and toxicity in vitro and in vivo , including antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory and anti-apoptosis.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, L.-H.S.and L.F.; methodology, L.F.and Y.Z.; software, Y.Z.; validation, L.-H.S., L.F.
