RESEARCH Open Access Anti-mosquito plants as an alternative or incremental method for malaria vector control among rural communities of Bagamoyo District, Tanzania Ester Innocent1*, Ahmed Hassanali2, William NW Kisinza3, Prince PP Mutalemwa3, Stephen Magesa3,4 and Edmund Kayombo1 Abstract Background: Plants represent one of the most accessible resources available for mosquito control by communities in Tanzania.However, no documented statistics exist for their contribution in the management of mosquitoes and other insects except through verbal and some publications.This study aimed at assessing communities ’knowledge, attitudes and practices of using plants as an alternative method for mosquito control among selected communities in a malaria-prone area in Tanzania.Methods: Questionnaires were administered to 202 respondents from four villages of Bagamoyo District, Pwani Region, in Tanzania followed by participatory rural appraisal with village health workers.
Secondary data collection for plants mentioned by the communities was undertaken using different search engines such as googlescholar, PubMED and NAPRALERT. Results: Results showed about 40.3% of respondents used plants to manage insects, including mosquitoes.A broad profile of plants are used, including “mwarobaini ”(Azadirachta indica) (22.5%), “mtopetope ”(Annona spp) (20.8%), “mchungwa/mlimau ”(Citrus spp) (8.3%), “mvumbashi/uvumbati ”(Ocimum spp) (7.4%), “mkorosho ”(Anacadium occidentale ) (7.1%), “mwembe ”(5.4%) ( Mangifera indica ),“mpera ”(4.1%) ( Psidium spp) and “maganda ya nazi ”(4.1%) ( Cocos nucifera ).Majority of respondents collected these plants from the wild (54.2%), farms (28.9%) and/or home gardens (6%).The roles played by these plants in fighting mosquitoes is reflected by the majority that deploy them with or withoutbed-nets (p > 0.55) or insecticidal sprays (p >0.22).
Most respondents were aware that mosquitoes transmit malaria (90.6%) while few respondents associated elephantiasis/hydrocele (46.5%) and yellow fever (24.3%) with mosquitoes. Most of the ethnobotanical uses mentioned by the communities were consistent with scientific information gatheredfrom the literature, except for Psidium guajava, which is reported for the first time in insect control.Conclusion: This survey has indicated some knowledge gap among community members in managing mosquito vectors using plant.The communities need a basic health education and sensitization for effective exploitation ofthis valuable tool for reducing mosquitoes and associated disease burdens.On the other hand, the government of Tanzania should strengthen advocacy of botanical pesticides development, registration and regulation for public health benefits because they are source of pest control tools people rely on them.

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2014, 10:56 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/10/1/56 Background Availability of healthcare services for improved diagnosis and treatment of mosquito-borne diseases have beenconsidered as two crucial interventions in minimizing mortality and morbidity risk due to exposure to infected mosquitoes [1]. However, these alone cannot eliminatethe high mosquito borne disease incidences in sub-Saharan Africa unless levels of infections and re-infections are substantially reduced through effective vector controlmechanisms.Thus, a new strategy for control and pre- vention of mosquito-borne diseases, reinforcing linkages between health and environment and emphasizing Inte-grated Vector Management (IVM), has been advocated by WHO [1].The strategy also stresses the importance of understanding the local vector ecology and local patternsof disease transmission.
This is considered important in choosing the appropriate vector control tool from a range of the available options. IVM needs to be locally managedand flexible, with emphasis on decentralization, active community participation and harnessing of local know- ledge [1].In line with this understanding, Tanzania hassince 2005 made a number of reforms in the health sector with most of the disease prevention and control program activities being planned and implemented at district level[2].However, the current mosquito vector management efforts are focused on the use of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN) and Indoor Residual Sprays (IRS).Very little efforthas been directed towards the use of pesticidal plants that have been deployed by rural communities since time immemorial as a first line intervention in primaryhealth care.
Furthermore, many of the synthetic insecticides avail- able to-date faces challenges due to environmental con-tamination, resistance development by target insectsand high deployment costs. This calls for the use of eco- logically friendly and effective botanical insecticides as an alternative measure.The aim of present study, there-fore, was to assess communities ’knowledge, attitudes and practices of using plants as an alternative or incremental method for mosquito vector control amongselected communities in a malaria-prone area of Baga- moyo district, Tanzania so as to know the existing and potential contribution of anti-insect plants in this en-deavor.Specifically, insights generated from this study, are expected to add value to the current IVM strategies in rural communities where plants continue to be deployedin mosquito control.
Methods Study area and design Bagamoyo district is in Coast Region and it is allocated about 75 km north of Dar es Salaam which is the major city of Tanzania. The majority of the populations areethnic groups of Wakwere, Wazaramo and Wazingua, however, other tribes co-exist in the area due to close proximity to Dar es Salaam.Majority of the populationare Muslims; farmers and fishermen who practices Swahili Culture that was introduced by Arabs during the slavery and ivory trade in 19th century.The study was carriedout in four villages of Yombo, Chansimba, Makurunge and Kongo (between 6° 24 ′19″S: 38° 50 ′31″E and 6° 29′03″S: 38° 49 ′49″E; Figure 1).The four villages are vicinity to river Ruvu which flows to the Indian Ocean.Over-flooding during the rainy seasons between April-May and October-November creates temporary andpermanent mosquito breeding water ponds in the vicinity, which contribute to high infectivity rates during these periods.
In addition, selection of the villages was based on Figure 1 The map showing areas of concentrated water ponds in the four villages located along Ruvu River in Bagamoyo District.Innocent et al.

The purpose of the visits was to get acquainted with the study areas and discuss the project with district and village leaders.Leaders in all the four villages agreed to convene a meeting of the adult residents with the help of Village Health Workers (VHWs) who identified the participantsbased on our criteria.Informed collective agreement was made and other useful information was sought.Those who consented proceeded to fil ling in the self-administered questionnaires and then followed by in-depth interview in a focus group discussion.During filling of questionnaires those who did not know how to read and write wereassisted to fill the questionnaires by the research team who asked them to respond to questions.
Focus group discus- sion consisted of leaders of the village and village healthworkers whom together checked and confirm identity of the meaning and of any ambiguities. However, FGD did not affect the priority of list which was given by individualswhen filling the questions.Semi-structured questionnaireand focus group discussions were translated in Swahili language (after being translated from the Standard Englishversion).Published information on the plant species men- tioned was gathered through literature search using google scholar, PubMED and NAPRALERT.The final results ofthe study were shared with all study participants during community feedback meetings at each of the study sites.Ethical considerations Scientific and ethical approval for the study (NIMR/HQ/ R.8a/Vol.

Majority of the respondents were of age ranging between 26 –39 years (54.5%) and were married (60.2%). There was, however, no significant difference betweenthe sex categories of the respondents (p > 0.32).Majority of the respondents had primary school level of education (66.7%) and were peasants (58.2%) who had stayed inthe study villages for varying periods (>15 years, 38.1%; 11–15 years, 17.5%; 6 –10 years, 16.5%; 2 –5 years, 15.5%; <1 year, 12%).From the questionnaires and ongeneral inspection of their homesteads, majority were of mud and metal roof (50.3%) or mud and grass roof (30.4%); the rest were of blocks with metal roof (18.4%)and few with blocks and grass or blocks and tiles (Table 1).People ’s knowledge and practice on use of plants for controlling mosquitoes About 81 (40.3%) of the respondents reported to have used plants to control arthropods including mosquitoes (30.3%) and scorpions (11.1%).
Others were spiders, cen- tipedes, army ants, bedbug, cockroaches, bees, termites,small ants, house flies, etc. Snakes which do not belong to the phylum arthropoda, was ranked second in terms of organisms that attack human habitats and it is alsocontrolled with plant products.Most of the arthropods mentioned were vectors of important tropical diseases or cause other harm to humans (Table 2).Further probing on the profile so fp l a n t su s e di nm a n a g i n g the arthropods identified Azadirachta indica ,Annona spp, Ocimum spp., Citrus spp., Anacardium occidentale Mangifera indica, Psidium spp and Cocos nucifera as the plant species commonly used (Table 3).The distances travelled by members of the community to collect theplants were less than one kilometer for majority of respondents (51.2%), while only 6.1% travelled up to 5 km.Most of the plants are collected from the wild(54.2%), with some from respondents ’farms (28.9%) and home gardens (6%).
Respondents who acknowledged using plants in con- trolling mosquitoes had different modalities and time for usage. Most of them either use plants daily (56.3%) or when need arises (25.0%).Parts of the plants frequentlymentioned for use include leaves (38.2%) and roots (41.2%).These are put on burning charcoal in containers placed at different locations inside the homesteads to generate smokeTable 4 Knowledge and practice of using plants in mosquito controls among Bagamoyo communities Variable No.of respondents% How long does it take for the insect to die?

According to the majority of the respondents (78.2%), the p rocess between application of the plant products and insects dying took less than sixhours (Table 4). Other modalities of application of plant parts were placing ground fres h materials (21.9%) or small pieces (12.5%) at selected places within the homesteads,and soaking plant parts or powder in water and then spray- ing (15.6%).Majority of the res pondents appeared to target adult mosquitoes in their cont rol efforts because most plant products were applied inside homesteads (45.2%) rather than at dumping areas (19.4%), water tanks (9.7%) or out- door sewage systems (3.2%).Knowledge about mosquito transmitted diseases, multiplication and control Majority of respondents (97.8%) were aware of disease agents transmitted by mosquitoes.Among the diseases mentioned included malaria (90.6%), elephantiasis/hydrocele (46.5%) and yellow fever (24.3%) (Table 5).
Furthermore, a large proportion of respondents associ- ated mosquito breeding and multiplication with stagnantwater (70.8%), dumping sites (35.1%), sewages (45.5%) and drainage systems (26.2%). Others included un- cleared bushes around the h ouses (35.6%) and leaking taps (13.4%).Further probing with respondents on mosquito preventive measures, identified bed-nets (63.4%) and drying stagnant water bodies (59.9%) as thebest options, in addition to keeping home premises clean (34.2%), using insecticides residual sprays (32.2%) and using plants/herbs (17.3%) (Table 5).
However,majority of the respondents were not comfortable with reliance on only one preventive measure such as ITN, or use of plants/herbs or insecticide residual spraybecause responses showed no significant differences between the uses of the three methods in all the four villages surveyed (Table 6).Table 5 Knowledge of mosquito transmitted diseases, multiplication and control (N = 202) Variable No* % Knowledge of diseases caused by mosquitoes Elephantiasis 118 58.4Hydrocele 70 34.7Malaria 183 90.6Yellow fever 49 24.3HIV 14 6.9All of the above 1 0.5Knowledge of places of mosquito breedingWater and air 22 10.9Water and bush 72 35.6Stagnant water alone 143 70.8 Air alone 9 4.5 Bush alone 43 21.3Dumping sites 71 35.1Sewage systems 92 45.5Drainage systems 53 26.2Leaking taps 27 13.4Preventive measuresUsing bednet 128 63.4Using treated bednet 75 37.1Using plants/herbs 35 17.3Filling stagnant water bodies 121 59.9Using insecticides residual sprays 65 32.2Keeping home premises clean 69 34.2Inspecting water bodies around the house premises 46 22.8Wearing long sleeves 19 9.4All of the above 15 7.4None of the above 4 2.0 *Multiple responses were allowed.

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2014, 10:56 Page 6 of 11 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/10/1/56 Perceptions on the use of plants in mosquito control On respondents ’attitude towards incorporating plants in mosquito management, their accessibility (26.7%) andaffordablility (29.2%) were important factors (Table 7).
The other reason highlighted was that the use of plants has been an old and familiar traditional practice (22.8%).However, the respondents were willing and happy to par- ticipate in other community-based mosquito management practices, such as draining off or reducing formation ofsmall stagnant water bodies around their houses (58.4%), cleaning bushes (35.6%) and applying safe insecticides on sizeable stagnant waters (34.2%) (Table 7). Secondary data generated on ethnobotanical status and scientific investigations on the plants mentioned Secondary data collection on plants mentioned by the communities in Bagamoyo district was done by using different search engines such as Google Scholar,PubMED and NAPRALERT.
Except for Psidium species(the use of which is reported for the first time), all plants mentioned have been either reported to be used tradi- tionally elsewhere to control some insects or investigatedscientifically and evidence on the presence of anti-insect phytochemicals generated (Table 8). Interestingly, control methods deployed in the ethnobotanical practices, as wellas scientific investigations undertaken, both targeted re- pellency and/or larvidical properties, similar to the use of the plants by the communities in Bagamoyo district(Tables 4 and 8).Discussion The Government of Tanzania has invested in a numberof interventions aimed at alleviating mosquito-bornediseases such as malaria and lymphatic filariasis.These include improving diagnosis and treatment of the diseases, provision of subsidized anti-malarial (ALU)drugs, and use of insecticide-treated nets (ITN).
Else- where, history and scientific evidence show that the battle against mosquito-borne diseases has succeededsignificantly through massive spraying with DDT [38,39], although ecological unfriendliness of the in- secticide has made its continued use very controversial.H o w e v e r ,t h i sm a yh a v eo p e n e du pt h eu s eo fp l a n t natural products with subtle anti-insect effects as a better alternative in reducing the burden of mosquito-bornediseases. Specific tropical plants are readily accessible by rural communities, and are eco-friendly and cost- effective.Although only 40.3% of the respondents in the Baga- moyo District reported using plants in the control of in- sects and especially mosquitoes.Many of the mentionedplants are exotic, although they were introduced on the African coastal area long time ago, and are from plant families with anti-insect activities [40-42].
Of special sig-nificance is that the majority of respondents were open to the possibility of using a combination of different methods in an integrated vector management and wereaware of different diseases caused by mosquito species such as malaria, elephantiasis/hydrocele and yellow fever. This could be attributed to regular community-based sensitizations from other malaria interventions such as the Bagamoyo Bednet [3,43,44] and on-going Malaria Vaccine Trial [45].The present study identified the need for regular outreach education on proper de- ployment of anti-insect plants within rural communitieswhere there is continued use of this natural resource to add value to the current mosquito and malaria control strategies.
Further R&D on the plant products deployed,their efficacy and modes of action would lay down the groundwork for selecting those that are particularly effective in different uses and in optimizing theirdeployment.Table 7 Attitude about elimination of mosquitoes (N = 202) Variable#No of response% Attitude towards eliminating mosquitoes from our homestead No, because mosquitoes are created by God 17 8.4Mosquitoes come with rain no one can control them35 17.3 No, mosquitoes are only seen after sun set 14 6.9 Yes, by eliminating stagnant water 81 40.1Yes, by closing widows and doors 22 10.9 Yes, by using indoor insecticide residual spray 65 32.2 Yes, by spraying insecticide in stagnant water 91 45.0Yes, by using ITN 77 38.1Participation in mosquito controlDestroying or avoid creating stagnant water bodies118 58.4 It is the responsibility of the government 9 4.5 Wait for the directives from the district malaria control focal person8 4.0 Community based programs of cleaning bushes 72 35.6 Community based programs of applying safe insecticides in stagnant waters69 34.2 Reliance of plants as source of insecticides We use them often 35 17.3It is an old practice 46 22.8We have many plants around us 54 26.7Not harmful like insecticides bought in the shop 40 19.8Plants are affordable, unlike insecticides 59 29.2 #Multiple responses were included.Innocent et al.

This calls for the government to strengthen advocacy of botanical pesticides develop-ment, registration and regulati on for public health benefits.
