Abstract citation ID: bvad114.556 Bone And Mineral Metabolism SAT260 Asymptomatic Vitamin A Toxicity CausingHypercalcemia Nandini Seshan, D.O.and Gayotri Goswami, M.D Westchester Medical Center, Valhalla, NY, USADisclosure: N.Seshan: None.G.Goswami: None.Background: Vitamin A toxicity is an overlooked cause of hypercalcemia.Most cases of hypercalcemia are second-ary to primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy.Highlevels of Vitamin A are thought to have a direct effect onthe bone by stimulating osteoclast resorption or inhibitingosteoblastic formation, therefore increasing the fracturerisk.Clinical Case: 56 year old female with history of alco- holic cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,acute kidney injury and now status post liver transplantﬁve months prior that was admitted for asymptomatic hy- percalcemia.
Initially, hypercalcemia was thought to be sec-ondary to cyclosporine, so medication was discontinued.Hypercalcemia resolved after hydration however she wasagain readmitted for hypercalcemia found on routine labs.She did not show any other signs of excess vitamin A. Labwork showed calcium 12.5 mg/dL (8.6 - 10.2mg/dL), albu-min 4g/dL (3.4 - 4.8g/dL), normal 24 hour urine calcium ex-cretion, eGFR 33mL/min, parathyroid hormone 16.9 pg/mL(8.7-77pg/mL), normal 1,25-OH and 25-OH vitamin D,PTHrP 25pmol/L, AM Cortisol 9mcg/dL, TSH 1.7 mIU/L(0.35 - 4.7mIU/L), serum protein electrophoresis unremark-able.Her vitamin A level was elevated to 113 ug/dL(30-75mcg/dL) and was diagnosed with hypercalcemia dueto elevated vitamin A levels.Treatment involved hydrationand discontinuation of her multivitamin containing vita-min A.Current limited literature suggests discontinuingvitamin A supplements will normalize vitamin A levelsover time.Her vitamin A levels improved over severalmonths.
Incidentally, due to complaints of back achesfrom prior injury, imaging showed acute compression frac-ture deformities of two thoracic vertebrae. Bone densityscan showed normal bone density.Bone turnover markerswere elevated indicative of increased bone resorption.Clinical Lesson/Conclusion: Hypervitaminosis A is a rare etiology of hypercalcemia.Vitamin A toxicity may be due to excess ingestion of preformed vitamin A throughsupplements and animal sources.Though not well under-stood, the proposed mechanism of vitamin A actions onthe bone involves stimulation of bone resorption through in-crease in osteoclastic activity and inhibition of bone forma-tion through osteoblastic suppression, leading to highserum calcium and increasing the risk of fractures.We pre-sent a unique case in a patient who developed hypercalce-mia secondary to hypervitaminosis A.
