Hypoxia interferes with energy metabolism, includ-ing the activity of the creatine energy shuttle, and therefore affects intracellular ATP and PCr levels. Here, we report that exposing cultured car- diomyocytes to low oxygen levels rapidly diminishes Cr transport by decreas-ing V max and Km.Pharmacological activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) abrogated the reduction in Cr transport caused by hypoxia.Cr sup-plementation increases ATP and PCr content in cardiomyocytes subjected tohypoxia, while also signiﬁcantly augmenting the cellular adaptive response tohypoxia mediated by HIF-1 activation.Our results indicate that: (1) hypoxiareduces Cr transport in cardiomyocytes in culture, (2) the cytoprotective effects of Cr supplementation are related to enhanced adaptive physiological responses to hypoxia mediated by HIF-1, and (3) Cr supplementationincreases the cellular ATP and PCr content in RNCMs exposed to hypoxia.
Introduction Hypoxia plays a key role in the pathogenesis of coronaryartery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease(Michiels 2004). Exposure to low oxygen content alters many systems that are needed for energy homeostasis: oxidative phosphorylation is inhibited, and creatine kinaseactivity and intracellular creatine (Cr), phosphocreatine(PCr), and ATP levels are decreased (Jennings and Reimer 1991).Profound alterations in Cr and PCr levels are con-sistently observed in heart failure (Neubauer 2007) and inthe peri-infarct region of the heart in animal models ofischemic injury (Hu et al.2006).Cardiomyocytes cannot synthesize Cr and depend on transport across the cell membrane to maintain intracellular Cr levels.Cr transportis provided by a membrane protein, the creatine ª2017 The Authors.Physiological Reports published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In cardiac and skeletal myocytes, Cr uptake is affected by the extracellular Cr concentration: increases in extracel-lular Cr content decrease Cr uptake (Loike et al. 1988;Darrabie et al.2011), whereas decreases in Cr contentincrease Cr uptake (Loike et al.1988; Darrabie et al.2011).These changes in Cr transport capacity are sec-ondary to an increase or decrease in V max, with no alter- ation in Km.Recently, we (Darrabie et al.2011) and others (Li et al.2010) have demonstrated that activation of AMP- activated kinase (AMPK), the cell’s energy master regulator(Hardie et al.2012), modulates Cr transport in a tissue-speciﬁc manner.AMPK activation increases V maxof Cr transport in cardiomyocytes in culture, whereas AMPKactivation in a kidney cell line decreases Cr transport.
Incardiomyocytes, these changes in V max correlate with changes in abundance of the cell-surface fraction of CrT protein, indicating that changes in the cell-surface popula- tion are associated with the cellular responses to extracellu-lar Cr availability. In the heart, AMPK is activated byhypoxia, upregulating energy-producing pathways anddecreasing energy expenditure (Kemp et al.1999; Dyckand Lopaschuk 2006).AMPK activation also appears tohave a protective effect in animal models of cardiac ische-mia (Borger et al.2008; Kim et al.2011; Li et al.2013).Changes in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF-1), a transcription factor required for cellularadaptation to low-oxygen conditions, are also likely rele-vant.HIF-1 is composed of aand bsubunits; HIF-1 b levels are not altered by normoxia, whereas HIF-1 ais normally ubiquitinated and targeted for proteosomaldegradation.
During hypoxia, HIF-1 ais no longer tar- geted for degradation and forms a dimer with HIF-1 b, becoming a transcription factor that interacts with hypox- ia-responsive elements (HREs), upregulating the expres-sion of genes such as VEGF, NOS2, adrenomedullin,endothelin 1, erythropoietin, GLUT1, and GLUT3, amongothers (Wenger 2000; Su et al. 2002; Sharp and Ber-naudin 2004; Ziello et al.2007).Together, the activationof AMPK and HIF-1 signaling pathways are thought toconstitute a functional axis critical for the survival of cell exposed to hypoxia (Wang et al.2012).The beneﬁts of Cr supplementation in the presence of oxidative stress, a hallmark of tissues subjected to hypox-ia, have been demonstrated in vitro and in animalmodels.For example, C2C12 myoblasts supplemented with Cr and challenged with H 2O2were capable of differ- entiating into myotubes, whereas nonsupplementedH 2O2-treated C 2C12were not (Sestili et al.2009).
Simi- larly, protective effects against oxidative stress wereobserved in spinal cord neuroblast cell cultures supple-mented with Cr (Sestili et al. 2009) and in rodent modelsof cerebral ischemia (Zhu et al.2004; Prass et al.2007;Perasso et al.2013), stroke (Prass et al.2007), Hunting- ton’s disease (Dedeoglu et al.2003), and fetal hypoxic stress (Ireland et al.2011; Dickinson et al.2014).Recently, it was reported that an increase in cardiac Crcontent exerted a protective effect in a rodent model ofischemia and reperfusion (Lygate et al.2012).Finally, wehave demonstrated that Cr supplementation amelioratesoxidative stress caused by doxorubicin in cultured car-diomyocytes (Santacruz et al.2015).In this study, we analyzed the effects of hypoxia on CrT transport kinetics, which has not been reported pre-viously.We tested the hypothesis that hypoxia decreasesCrT function.
Rat neonatal cardiomyocyte (RNCM) cul-tures were used in a validated in vitro experimentaldesign that recapitulates ischemia-induced hypoxia. Wealso evaluated the effect of Cr supplementation on HIF-1activation and cell survival.We report that exposure of cardiomyocytes in culture to low oxygen rapidly dimin- ishes Cr transport by decreasing V maxand Km.Cr supple- mentation signiﬁcantly increases ATP and PCr contentand augments HIF-1 activation, thereby increasing thecellular adaptive response to hypoxia.Materials and Methods Cell culture and hypoxia model validation RNCMs were harvested from 2-day-old Sprague Dawleypups as described previously (Bursac et al.1999; San-tacruz et al.2015) following protocols approved by theInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committees at DukeUniversity, Harvard Medical School and BrighamWomen’s Hospital.
Hypoxia was achieved by placing the cells in a hypoxia incubator chamber (STEMCELL Tech- nologies, Vancouver, BC) ﬁlled with a 5% CO 2-nitrogen balanced gas mixture for 5 min at 15 L/min (ﬁnal oxy-gen<1% inside the chamber). The experimental model was validated by quantifying HIF-1-mediated transcrip-tional activity measured using the HRE luciferase reportergene as described previously (Lima et al.2009).RNCMswere transduced with HRE adenovirus (HRE-Ad, 200 viral particles/cell).Forty-eight hours after transduction, the cells were incubated in hypoxic conditions for varyingtimes (2 –24 h as noted in ﬁgure legends).HIF-1 activa- tion was determined by measuring luciferase expression 2017 | Vol.5 | Iss.16 | e13382 Page 2ª2017 The Authors.Physiological Reports published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.on behalf of The Physiological Society and the American Physiological SocietyHypoxia Reduces Creatine Transport in Cardiomyocytes L.Santacruz et al.
using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison WI). As per experimental design, cultures were supplemented for 24 h with 1 mmol/L Cr and/or 0.5 mmol/L AICARbefore a 12-h incubation in hypoxic conditions, wheresupplementation was continued.CrT-AAV preparation and transduction of RNCM cells RNCMs have low Cr transport; therefore, to facilitate the kinetic and biochemical analysis of Cr transport inRNCMs exposed to hypoxia, an adeno-associated virusencoding the human isoform of CrT was prepared byexcising the CrT open reading frame from a pcDNA 3.1construct described previously (Darrabie et al.2012)using EcoR I and Hind III restriction enzymes and ligated into the pTR vector.Recombinant CrT-AAV was gener- ated by standard triple transfection method (Grieger et al.2006) using XX6-80 helper plasmid with the SASTGpackaging plasmid (Piacentino et al.2012) and the CrT-TR plasmid.Recombinant SASTG-CrT was puriﬁed andviral titer was evaluated by dot-blot hybridization (Grie-ger et al.
2006). Experimentation began 48 h after cellswere transduced with 3000 viral particles/cell.Immunoblots RNCMs were cultured in six-well plates.Cells werescraped in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mmol/L NaCl, 1%Triton X-100, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containingprotease inhibitors (mini-Complete protease inhibitors,Roche Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitors(5 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride, 2.5 mmol/L Na 2P2O7, 50 mmol/L b-Glycerol, 1 mmol/L Na3VO 3,Sigma St Louis, MO).Cell lysates were cen- trifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 100,000 g.The supernatant protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninicacid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce Biotechnology).Super-natants were mixed with sample buffer (125 mmol/LTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 6% sodium dodecylsulfate, 10% b-mercaptoethanol) and then boiled for 3-5 min.Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDFmembranes.
For AMPK detection, membranes wereprobed with rabbit anti-alpha AMPK antibodies to detecttotal AMPK and rabbit anti-AMPK phosphothreonine(Thr-172) to detect activated AMPK, both at a 1:1000dilution. Phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (pACC; adownstream target of AMPK) was detected with 1:100 dilutions of rabbit anti-phospho-ACC.The secondary antibody was HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit at a1:10,000 dilution.TATA box binding protein was used asa loading control on immunoblots.It was detected usinga 1:1000 dilution of mouse monoclonal antibody and purchased from AbCam (Cambridge, MA).All other pri- mary antibodies were purchased form Cell SignalingTechnology (Danvers, MA).Bands were visualized using anECL Western blotting detection system GE Healthcare (Pis-cataway, NJ) and quantiﬁed by densitometry using theImageJ algorithm (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda).
Apoptosis and cellular viability assays Cell viability was measured using the luminescent CellTi-ter-Glo Viability Assay (Promega, Madisom WI). Apopto-sis was quantiﬁed by measuring the activity of Caspase3/7 using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 kit (Promega Madison, WI).14C-Cr transport measurements in RNCMs 14C-Cr uptake was measured in triplicate as described pre- viously (Darrabie et al.2011).Cells were washed twicewith choline buffer (150 mmol/L choline chloride;1 mmol/L CaCl 2; 5 mmol/L MgCl 2; 2 mmol/L KCl; 5 mmol/L HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5) at room temperature, fol-lowed by a 10-min incubation at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO 2incubator in sodium uptake buffer (150 mmol/L sodium chloride; 1 mmol/L CaCl 2; 5 mmol/L MgCl 2; 2 mmol/L KCl; 5 mmol/L HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5) radiola- beled with 0.550 lCi/mL for RNCM14C-Cr (55 mCi/ mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St.Louis, MO),with ﬁnal Cr concentration for time course experimentsadjusted to 15 lmol/L using a nonradiolabeled compound.
Uptake was terminated by aspirating the radiolabeled solu-tion, followed by three washes with ice-cold choline buffer.The cells were lysed in 0.5 mL of 500 mmol/L NaOH and heated to 80 °C for 30 min. A 100 lL aliquot of lysed cells was subjected to scintillation counting in a Beckman Coul-ter LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter.Cr transport wasnormalized to protein concentration.Cr uptake data wereexpressed as nanomoles per milligram of protein.Proteinconcentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acidprotein assay (Pierce Biotechnology) and bovine serumalbumin as a standard.For kinetic analysis, cells were grown in 24-well plates and transduced as described ear- lier.During the uptake assays, the extracellular Cr concen-trations ranged from 5 lmol/L to 305 lmol/L as described earlier.The number of independent experiments used fordata analysis is noted in the corresponding ﬁgure legend.Michaelis –Menten plots were generated using curve-ﬁtting software (SigmaPlot /C226ver.9.0).

Statistical analysis Data are reported as mean /C6SEM.Data were analyzed using T-test, ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA as appropri- ate.Tukey’s test was used for post hoc, pairwise, inter-group comparisons (Prism 7) where indicated.Alphaerror values <0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.Results Model validation To ensure that our experimental design reproduced the physiological responses to hypoxia, we quantitated themagnitude and time course of HIF-1 activation using aluciferase reporter assay.RNCM cultures were transducedwith an adenovirus-encoding luciferase under the controlof the hypoxia response element (AdHRE-luc).The inten-sity of the luminescent response is proportional to the amount of active HIF-1 that interacts with the hypoxia response element (Lima et al.2009).
A statistically signiﬁ-cant ( ~140%) increase in HIF-1 activity was measured after 12 h of incubation in hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1A).HIF-1 activity continued increasing throughout the 24 hof incubation in hypoxic conditions, indicating that theexperimental model recapitulates the cellular responses tolow oxygen.To evaluate the effects of hypoxia on cultured RNCMs, cell viability was measured by quantifying metabolicallyactive cells (Fig.1B).There was a signiﬁcant decreaseafter 1 hour of incubation in low-oxygen conditions.There was no further decrease in metabolically active cellsif incubation in low oxygen was continued beyond 12 h.The onset of apoptosis was determined by measuring Cas-pase 3/7 activation.A statistically signiﬁcant ( ~60%) increase in protease activity indicating increased apoptosis was detected after 6 h of growth in a hypoxic environ-ment (Fig.1C).Incubation after 1 h in low oxygen alsoresulted in a loss of spontaneous contractile activity.

1B) and antedated sig-niﬁcant increases apoptosis (Fig. 1C).RNCMs have low Cr transport capacity, which makes the determination of kinetic parameters such as V maxand Kmby14C-Cr uptake technically difﬁcult.To better char- acterize the mechanisms mediating the decrease in Cr transport, we transduced RNCM cultures with an adeno- associated virus (AAV) encoding the human isoform ofCrT.We utilized a novel engineered AAV termed SASTGthat conferred enhanced cardiac transduction (Piacentinoet al.2012) to deliver cDNA encoding CrT intocardiomyocytes.Transduced RNCMs exhibited Cr trans- port (Fig.2B) with characteristic saturation kinetics and V max of 90.31 /C67.07 nmol/mg protein and a Kmof 30.76/C65.34 lmol/L, which are well within the values reported in the literature (Loike et al.1988; Dai et al.1999; Darrabie et al.2011).
Characterization of kinetics ofCr transport in transduced RNCMs subjected to hypoxiafor 12 h revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in V max(from 90.31/C67.07 to 30.76 /C65.24 nmol/mg of protein) and Km(from 30.76 /C65.24–7.20/C61.11 lmol/L) compared with controls ( n=3,t-test P<0.05). Pretreatment with AICAR prevents the decrease in Cr uptake induced by hypoxia Previously, we demonstrated that pharmacological activa- tion of AMPK increases Cr transport in cardiomyocytes (Darrabie et al.2011).Therefore, we tested the effect of pharmacological AMPK activation by 0.5 mmol/L AICARbeginning 24 h before exposure to hypoxia.Cr transportwas signiﬁcantly higher than that observed in controls(cultures exposed to hypoxia that did not receive AICAR)and remained elevated throughout the time course of theexperiment (Fig.3).
The activation of AMPK by AICAR and hypoxia was veriﬁed by densitometric quantiﬁcation of the ratio of kinase phosphorylated at Thr172 (representing the activeAMPK form, pAMPK) on immunoblots (Fig. 4C).Theresults indicate that sustained exposure to hypoxia andAICAR signiﬁcantly increased the activation of AMPK bythreefold after 24 h of incubation in low oxygen 0 h 1 h 3 h 6 h 12 h0.00.10.20.30.4 Hypoxia14C-Cr Uptake (nmol/mg prot)* ** Creatine [µmol/L]0 100 200 30014C-Cr Uptake (nmol/mg prot) 020406080100120 Control (Normoxia) AAV-CrT Hypoxia 12 h AAV-CrTMean Vmax 90.31 ± 7.07 Mean Km 30.76 ± 5.24 Mean Vmax 39.98 ± 6.66 * Mean Km 7.20 ± 1.11 *A B Figure 2.Hypoxia decreases Cr transport in RNCMs.(A)14C-Cr uptake was measured in RNCM cultures grown in a hypoxic atmosphere ( <1% O 2) for increasing periods of time.The data present the mean /C6SEM of four independent14C-Cr uptake experiments.

2011). We measured the effects of incubation inmedium supplemented with AICAR in culture incubatedin low oxygen on the levels of pACC (Fig.4C).Although not statistically signiﬁcant, there appeared to be a pro- gressive increase in the pACC/ACC ratio with incubationtime in hypoxia, and the increase was accentuated byincubation with AICAR (Fig.4B).Quantitation of ATP, Cr, and PCr The cellular content of ATP, Cr, and PCr was measuredin RNCM cultures exposed to 12 h of hypoxia in control media or media supplemented with Cr, AICAR, or both, and compared to similar cultures grown in the presenceof oxygen (Fig.5).The results indicate supplementationwith Cr, AICAR, or both increased the mean value ofATP content; however, this increase did not reach statisti-cal signiﬁcance in cultures grown under control oxygenconditions (Fig.5A).Hypoxia did not signiﬁcantlydecrease ATP content in cultures grown in control media.
However, RNCMs that were subjected to hypoxia and supplemented with Cr had elevated ATP content com-pared with nonsupplemented cells. Similarly, elevatedATP content was observed in hypoxia cultures treatedwith AICAR and Cr, but not when treated with AICARalone.PCr content (Fig.5B) was signiﬁcantly elevated incultures grown in control oxygen conditions and supple-mented with Cr or AICAR when compared with nonsup- plemented conditions.Exposure to hypoxia signiﬁcantly decreased PCr content in RNCMs that received AICARalone when compared to similar normoxic growth condi-tions.However, there was no signiﬁcant decrease in PCrcontent in hypoxic cultures supplemented with Cr or Crand AICAR combined.Cr content was also quantiﬁed incultures supplemented with Cr, AICAR, or both following12 h of hypoxia and compared with RNCMs grown in similar conditions and control oxygen levels.There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in Cr content amongthe different culture conditions (Fig.5C).
Cr supplementation augments HIF-1 expression We tested the effects of Cr supplementation (preincuba- tion) alone or in combination with AICAR on HIF-1 acti- vation in cardiomyocytes exposed to 12 h of hypoxia(Fig. 6).Cr supplementation of hypoxic cells signiﬁcantlyincreased HIF-1 activity above that recorded in RNCMsexposed to hypoxia alone.Preincubation with AICAR hadthe opposite effect, signiﬁcantly decreasing HIF-1 activity.RNCM cultures that were preincubated with media sup-plemented with both Cr and AICAR also had signiﬁcantly increased HIF-1 activity compared with controls, of a magnitude similar to that recorded in cultures supple-mented with Cr only.Discussion Hypoxia has deleterious effects on energy metabolism,ultimately reducing ATP and PCr stores in tissues.

RNCMshave inherently low Cr transport capacity, thus makingaccurate determination of V maxand Kmby14C-Cr uptake impossible. To overcome this limitation, we transduced RNCMs with an adeno-associated virus that expresses the human CrT protein.Cr transport in transduced cells hadcharacteristics similar to those reported previously in theliterature for cardiomyocytes in culture (Darrabie et al.2011).Kinetic analysis demonstrated a signiﬁcant decreaseinV max(by 56%) and Km(by 76%) compared with val- ues measured in transduced cells grown under normoxicconditions.The decrease in V max, a functional measure- ment of active cell membrane transporters, indicates that the cell surface content of CrT protein is decreased, aspreviously demonstrated (Darrabie et al.2011, 2012).Adecrease in K mindicates altered binding or release of Cr from the transporter, which decreases overall transportcapacity.
Taken together, these alterations in kineticparameters suggest that hypoxia not only decreases thenumber of active transporters on the cell surface, but may also alter the structure of the CrT protein in such a way that the interactions with Cr during the substrate0 h 12 h0.00.51.01.52.0 HypoxiaATP content (Normalized to control)Control CrAICAR Cr+AICAR * # + +^ 0 h 12 h0123 HypoxiaPCr content (Normalized to control)Control CrAICAR Cr+AICAR* ++^** 0 h 12 h0.00.51.01.5 HypoxiaCreatine content (Normalized to control)Control CrAICAR Cr+AICARA B C Figure 5.

Previously, we demonstrated that pharmaco-logical activation of AMPK increases Cr transport capac-ity in cultured cardiomyocytes (Darrabie et al. 2011).Here, we extend our observations to the effects of AMPK activation on Cr transport during hypoxia.Pharmacologi-cal AMPK activation not only preserved but actuallyincreased Cr transport in RNCMs exposed to low oxygenconcentrations (Fig.3).AICAR also extended the timecourse of AMPK activation in RNCMs exposed to hypox-ia.In the absence of pharmacological stimulation, signiﬁ-cant AMPK activation was detected after 24 h of hypoxia in RNCMs (Fig.4A and B).In these cardiomyocytes, the HIF-1 mediated cellular mechanisms of adaptation tohypoxia developed before AMPK activity became statisti-cally signiﬁcant (Figs.1A and 4A).HIF-1 mediatedresponses were recorded as early as 6 h after the onsethypoxia, as demonstrated using a luciferase reporterunder the control of HRE transcription control.
The activation pathways for AMPK and HIF-1 are independent; however, a recent report demonstrates that inCaenorhabditis elegans , HIF-1 and AMPK regulate each other reciprocally in response to oxidative stress. In thisorganism, HIF-1 is phosphorylated by AMPK, decreasingits stability (Hwang et al.2014).Such a mechanism isconsistent with the reduced HIF-1 activity we observed incardiomyocytes supplemented with AICAR and incubatedin hypoxic conditions (Fig.6), where the boost in AMPK activity produced by AICAR treatment appears to dam- pen the early HIF-1 response to hypoxia observed inRNCMs.As mentioned previously, Cr supplementation has been reported to have a protective effect in both neurons, myo-blasts, and cardiomyocytes in culture when subjected tohypoxic and increased oxidative stressors (Balestrino et al.1999, 2002; Adcock et al.2002; Caretti et al.2010; Sartini et al.2012).
Given the role of Cr/PCr in maintaining ATP levels in the cell, we sought to quantify the effects ofCr supplementation, as well as that of AMPK activationalone or in combination with Cr supplementation onATP, PCr, and Cr content. Cr cellular content did not change signiﬁcantly with hypoxia or supplementations with Cr alone or in combination with AICAR.Cr is lostat a rate of 2% per 24 h by spontaneous conversion tocreatinine (Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk 2000).Therefore,decreased Cr content due to diminished Cr transportcapacity after incubation in hypoxic conditions may notbe detectable in the time frame assayed.Cellular Cr mayalso be compartmentalized, and signiﬁcant alterations in these intracellular Cr pools cannot be detected using a whole cell extract assay, or when testing relatively smallcell numbers..However, our results indicate that Cr sup-plementation of RNCMs signiﬁcantly augments PCr levelsunder normal and hypoxic conditions.
Cr supplementation signiﬁcantly increased ATP content in RNCMs subjected to hypoxia. In RNCMs incubated incontrol media and exposed to hypoxia, the decrease in ATP levels failed to reach signiﬁcance when compared with control conditions.This is contrary to observationsin intact hearts subjected to hypoxia, which very quicklybecome depleted of ATP and PCr.Adult cardiomyocytesdepend on b-oxidation of fatty acids to generate ATP, whereas the neonate cardiomyocytes have not developedb-oxidation capabilities and use glycolysis as the main ATP generation pathway (Lopaschuk and Jaswal 2010).RNCMs are thus capable of maintaining constant ATP levels even when subjected to prolonged hypoxic stress.RNCMs spontaneously beat in culture; however, within1 h of exposure to hypoxia, they stop contracting.There-fore, the overall consumption of ATP decreases as well,which would result in the ATP levels not changing signiﬁ-cantly when compared with RNCMs grown in normoxia.
Further examination of the effect of Cr supplementa- tion on the adaptive responses of RNCMs to hypoxia indicated that Cr supplementation initiated beforehypoxia also signiﬁcantly increased HIF-1 activity com-pared with controls (hypoxia and no supplementation).Interestingly, when RNCM cultures were simultaneouslysupplemented with Cr and AICAR prior to hypoxia, HIF-1 activity levels were signiﬁcantly higher than thoseobserved in control conditions, but similar in magnitude to those observed in cultures receiving Cr supplementa- tion only. These observations suggest that Cr supplemen-tation relieves the “inhibitory” effect that increasedAMPK activity has on HIF-1 function.Further studies toelucidate the mechanisms and signaling pathways mediat-ing Cr supplementation-enhanced HIF-1 are warranted.An enhancement in the adaptive responses may alsoexplain the protective effect of Cr supplementation reported in studies using mouse models of cerebral ische- mia (Zhu et al.
2004) and stroke (Prass et al. 2007).Thetiming and duration of Cr supplementation in relation tothe ischemic insult also needs to be carefully analyzed in 2017 | Vol.5 | Iss.16 | e13382 Page 8ª2017 The Authors.Physiological Reports published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.on behalf of The Physiological Society and the American Physiological SocietyHypoxia Reduces Creatine Transport in Cardiomyocytes L.Santacruz et al.order to fully realize the potential therapeutic value of Cr supplementation in a clinical setting.In summary, we report for the ﬁrst time that Cr trans- port is diminished within hours when cultured cardiomy-ocytes are exposed to hypoxia and that Crsupplementation signiﬁcantly magniﬁes the physiologicalresponses mediating adaptation and cell survival in lowoxygen.This reduction in Cr transport capacity may con-tribute to the energy disturbances that characterize the ischemic heart.Cr supplementation increases ATP and PCr content in cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia.
Inaddition to these increases, the ability to enhance thephysiological response to oxidative stress, may also under-lie some of the beneﬁcial effects of Cr supplementationthat have been previously reported, and merits furtherstudy.
