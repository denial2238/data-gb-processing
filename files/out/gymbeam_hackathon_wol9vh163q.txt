After an 11-week adaptation period (blood and milk sampled monthly), cows received an intraruminal dose of Se77 (either Se77 yeast or NaSe77O3) followed by a 4-day period of blood and rumen fluid sampling, and total collection of feces, urine, and milk. Data were analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS with fixed effects of treat - ment, time, and their interaction, and random effect of block.Daily DMI (23 ± 0.6 kg), milk yield (35 ± 1.2 kg), plasma glutathione peroxidase (64 ± 4.2 U), and serum Se (0.11 ± 0.003 µg/g) were not different be - tween treatments during the adaptation period.Serum Se77 maximum concentration and area under the curve (AUC) were not different between treatments for 72 hours following infusion, but rumen fluid Se77 AUC was higher (P = 0.02) for ORG cows.Apparent ab - sorption (64 ± 1.3%) and retention (44 ± 1.5%) of the Se77 dose did not differ between treatments.The ORG cows had lower urinary excretion (13 vs.17 ± 0.6%; P < 0.01), higher milk excretion (6 vs.
2 ± 0.3%; P < 0.01), and similar fecal excretion (36 ± 1.3%; P = 0.9) of Se77 compared to INO cows. These results indicate that ORG Se increased Se content of milk and decreased Se excretion in urine, but did not alter per - formance, antioxidant status, and apparent absorption and retention of Se in mid-lactation cows.Key words: trace mineral, nutrition152 Comparison of an Antioxidant Source and Antioxidant Plus BCAA on Athletic Performance and Post Exercise Recovery of Horses.Tanja Hess1, Emily Kent1, Renan Regatieri Casagrande1, Christine Levihn1, Grace Romo1, Stephen J.Coloman1, Kevin Herkelman2, 1Colorado State University, 2Cooperative Research Farms Antioxidant supplementation has been shown to de - crease post exercise oxidative stress but can lead to decreased post-exercise muscle protein synthesis.
The objective of this study was to compare the effects of the supplementation with a control feed with low anti - oxidant content (CONT) to a high antioxidant feed (AO), versus a high antioxidant and branched chain amino acid feed (BCAO) on post-exercise protein syn - thesis and oxidative stress. Our hypothesis is that sup - plementing AO with BCAO will reduce oxidative stress without hindering muscle protein synthesis.Eighteen mixed breed conditioned polo horses were assigned to one of the three treatments.All horses consumed CONT for 30 days and were then submitted to a lac - tate threshold test (LT).One hour after this and all LT, each group was assigned and given their treatments.LT were done at 15 and 30 days of supplementation.Blood was collected before, two and four hours after LT, and analyzed for oxidative stress based on glutathione per - oxidase, superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde concentrations by ELISA.
Muscle biopsies were taken before and 4 hours after LT and analyzed for the ex - pression of protein synthesis by RT-PCR. Results were analyzed in a mixed model by ANOV A and com - pared by LSM.A reduction of oxidative stress was found over time (P < 0.050) with no treatment effect (P >0.50).An upregulation of protein synthesis after exercise was found for muscle primers CD36, CPT1, DK4, MyF5, and Myogenin (P < 0.050).There was a treatment by time effect for MyoD (P = 0.027), where AO was upregulated the most after exercise compared to BCAO and CONT.DK4 had a treatment by time effect trend (P = 0.073), where AO and BCAO were upregulated and CONT was unchanged after exercise.This study demonstrated post exercise muscle synthesis with no advantage of AO plus BCAO compared to AO.Key words: antioxidant; muscle protein syn - thesis; equine exercise
