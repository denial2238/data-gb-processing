ORIGINAL ARTICLE L-carnitine enhances axonal plasticity and improves white- matter lesions after chronic hypoperfusion in rat brain Yuji Ueno1,2, Masato Koike3, Yoshiaki Shimada2, Hideki Shimura1, Kenichiro Hira2, Ryota Tanaka2, Yasuo Uchiyama3,4, Nobutaka Hattori2and Takao Urabe1 Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion causes white-matter lesions (WMLs) with oxidative stress and cognitive impairment.However, the biologic mechanisms that regulate axonal plasticity under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion have not been fully investigated.Here,we investigated whether L-carnitine, an antioxidant agent, enhances axonal plasticity and oligodendrocyte expression, and explored the signaling pathways that mediate axonal plasticity in a rat chronic hypoperfusion model.Adult male Wistar rats subjected to ligation of the bilateral common carotid arteries (LBCCA) were treated with or without L-carnitine.
L-carnitine-treatedrats exhibited signi ﬁcantly reduced escape latency in the Morris water maze task at 28 days after chronic hypoperfusion. Western blot analysis indicated that L-carnitine increased levels of phosphorylated high-molecular weight neuro ﬁlament (pNFH), concurrent with a reduction in phosphorylated phosphatase tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), and increasedphosphorylated Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) at 28 days after chronic hypoperfusion.L-carnitine reduced lipidperoxidation and oxidative DNA damage, and enhanced oligodendrocyte marker expression and myelin sheath thickness after chronic hypoperfusion.L-carnitine regulates the PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and enhances axonal plasticity while concurrently ameliorating oxidative stress and increasing oligodendrocyte myelination of axons, thereby improving WMLs andcognitive impairment in a rat chronic hypoperfusion model.
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2015) 35,382 –391; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2014.210; published online 3 December 2014 Keywords: axonal outgrowth; chronic hypoperfusion; L-carnitine; oxidative stress; stroke INTRODUCTION Cerebral white matter constitutes 50% of human brain mass and contains abundant axons and oligodendrocytes. 1Cerebral white matter is damaged by a variety of neurologic disorders including ischemic stroke, and white-matter lesions (WMLs) have been associated with cognitive impairment.2Oligodendrocytes are lipid rich and exhibit low levels of antioxidant enzymes, which reduce their ability to cope with the increased generation of reactive oxygen species during ischemic insults.3Axons are vulnerable to ischemia, and are also damaged by axon –oligodendro- cyte interactions after ischemia.4Permanent occlusion of both common carotid arteries can induce chronic cerebral hypoperfu-sion in experimental animals, which results in WMLs in the corpuscallosum.
5–7Various pathogenic factors are implicated in WMLs, including oxidative stress, in ﬂammatory reactions, and endothelial injuries.6 L-carnitine therapy is required for children with an inborn error of metabolism as well as chronic debilitating diseases including cancer, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease.8,9In such chronic diseases, L-carnitine has a pivotal role in suppressinginﬂammatory reactions, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.9L-carnitinehas also been proven bene ﬁcial in ischemic heart disease and peripheral artery disease.10,11Continuous supplementation with L- carnitine increases carnitine content, stimulates pyruvateoxidation, and thereby remodels the myocardium and improvescardiac dysfunction. 12However, little information is available on the effect of L-carnitine on cerebral ischemia.13–15To date, the effect of L-carnitine on WMLs induced by chronic cerebral hypo-perfusion is essentially unknown.
Axonal outgrowth and plasticity are critical processes during brain repair after stroke injury, and related to improvements in neurologic de ﬁcits after stroke. 16,17Stroke induces axonal out- growth, and emerging data indicate that the phosphoinositide3-kinase/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3 βsignaling pathway enhances axonal outgrowth after stroke.18To date, the mechan- isms that regulate axonal plasticity after chronic hypoperfusionhave not been extensively studied.In the present study, we used arat chronic hypoperfusion model to determine whether L-carnitineexerts a neuroprotective role in WMLs and enhances axonalplasticity, and investigated the signaling pathways that mediateaxonal plasticity.

The Animal Care Committee of Juntendo University approved all animal protocols used inthe present study, and efforts were made to minimize the number ofanimals used and their suffering.Adult male Wistar rats (9 to 11 weeks old)weighing 280 to 320 g were purchased from Charles River Institute(Kanagawa, Japan).
Chronic cerebral hy poperfusion was induced by ligation of both common carotid arteries (LBCCA), as described previously. 4–6Rats were anesthetized with 1.0% to 2.0% iso ﬂurane in 30% O 2and 70% N 2O.Through a midline incision, the bilateral common carotid arteries werecarefully separated from the cervical sympathetic and vagal nerves, andligatured permanently.During this procedure, the body temperature wasmaintained at 37.0 ± 0.5°C.Rats at baseline (before LBCCA) or 7, 14, 21, and28 days after LBCCA were reanesthetized with 1% iso ﬂurane, 70% N 2O:30% O2, and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.The brain was dissected out immedia-tely, post ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours, and stored in 30% sucrose in 0.1 mol/L PBS.For immunohistochemistry, 20- μm-thick free- ﬂoating coronal sections of rat brain were prepared for staining.
Drug Administration and Classi ﬁcation Rats were randomly divided into the following groups: (1) L-carnitine group: post-LBCCA, rats were treated per os daily with 600 mg/kg (in 0.7 mL saline) L-carnitine (Sigma Aldrich, Inc., St Louis, MO, USA) using an oralgavage tube, until euthanasia;19(2) vehicle group: rats received per os administration of saline, volumes similar to the L-carnitine group, using a gavage tube; and (3) control sham-operated group: rats underwent the protocol described for the vehicle group, but were spared LBCCA. Measurement of Cerebral Blood Flow Cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) was measured at a left temporal window, using laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (Laser Tissue Blood Flow Meter FLO-C1; Omega W a v e ,I n c .
,T o k y o ,J a p a n ) .A ﬂat rectangular sheet-shaped probe (7.5 mm in length and 1.0 mm in depth) was positioned between the temporal muscle and the lateral aspect of the skull, according to a previously publishedmethod.20Craniotomy was not required and CBF was monitored continu- ously in 3 to 5 minutes sessions before, immediately after, and 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after LBCCA. Reproducibly recorded CBF velocities were obtained.Water Maze Task The water maze task was performed to evaluate de ﬁcits in learning and spatial memory induced by cerebral chronic hypoperfusion, using themethod described previously.6A circular transparent acrylic platform with a radius of 20 cm was placed in a 150-cm diameter circular pool ﬁlled with water (20 cm depth) set at 22 ± 1°C, with the top surface of the platform positioned 3 cm below the surface of the water.The water in the pool was made opaque with milk so that the rats were unable to see the underwaterplatform.
Rats were released facing a wall from a standard point, and thetime taken to escape to the platform was recorded as the escape latency.The rats performed ﬁve trials per day, with a constant intertrial interval of 30 minutes, for 3 consecutive days before LBCCA. The escape latency was analyzed before LBCCA and 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after LBCCA.Rotarod Performance Test The rotarod performance test was performed to assess motor dysfunction induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.After 3 consecutive days oftraining before the operation, rotarod performance was evaluated at 7, 14, 21,and 28 days after LBCCA.The speed was slowly increased from 10 to 40 r.p.m.(0.005 to 0.08 g) over a period of 4 minut es.The trial ended when the animal falls off the rungs.The maximum duration on the device was recorded withthree rotarod measurements.Rotarod test data are presented as percentagesof the maximal duration, compared with the internal baseline control.
Immunohistochemistry and Double Immuno ﬂuorescence Immunohistochemistry was performed on brain sections, as previously described.18After incubation in 0.3% H 2O2followed by 10% block ace in 0.1 mol/L PBS, coronal sections of the corpus callosum were immuno-stained overnight at 4°C using a mouse monoclonal antibody against 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE, a marker of lipid peroxidation; dilution, 40:1; Japan Institute for the Control of Aging, Japan), a mouse monoclonal antibody against 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG, a marker of oxida- tive DNA damage; dilution 100:1; Japan Institute for the Control of Aging), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against glutathione-S-transferase-pi (GST-pi, a marker of oligodendrocytes; dilution, 1,000:1; Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA, USA), and ss-DNA (a marker of apoptotic cells; dilution, 100:1; Dako Corporation, Carpentaria, CA, USA) staining.
The sections were then treated with secondary antibodies (dilution, 300:1; Vectastain; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Immunoreactivity was subsequentlyvisualized using the avidin-biotin complex method (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories) and developed with diaminobenzidine.For double immuno- ﬂuorescence staining, mouse anti-SMI31 (a marker of phosphorylated high molecular weight neuro ﬁlament, pNFH; 1:100; Covance, Emeryville, CA, USA), mouse anti-SMI32 (a marker of nonphosphorylated NFH, 1:100; Covance), and rat anti-myelin basic protein (MBP; 1:100; Millipore, Philadelphia, PA, USA) were used.After washing with PBS three times, rat coronal sectionswere incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies listed above, and subsequently with Cy3 or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature.Electron Microscopy Anesthetized rats were ﬁxed by cardiac perfusion with 2% paraformalde- hyde/2% glutaraldehyde buffered with 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer.
Brain tissues were quickly excised and subsequently immersed in the same ﬁxative overnight at 4°C. Using Rodent Brain Matrices (ASI Instruments, Warren, MI, USA) 1-mm-thick brain slices were made.The samples were post ﬁxed with 2% OsO 4in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer for 2 hours at 4°C in the dark, block- stained in 1% uranyl acetate for 1 hour, dehydrated with a graded series of aqueous alcohol solutions, and embedded in Epon 812 (TAAB, Barks, UK).Silver sections were cut with an ultramicrotome (Leica UC6; Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed with an electron microscope (HT7700; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).Western Blot All procedures were performed at 4°C.
To prepare samples for westernblot, corpus callosum tissues were extracted from rat brains, and trans-ferred into 700 mL homogenization buffer (0.25 mol/L sucrose, 0.15 mol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA) containing Protease Inhibitor (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), and homogenized with 3 × 10 strokes using a Dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton Scienti ﬁc, Millville, NJ, USA). The homogenates were centrifuged 10 minutes at 700 g.The supernatant was collected and ﬁltered through layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged 15 minutes at 12,000 g.The ﬁnal supernatant was referred to as cytosol and used for western blotting.21 Western blots were performed according to published methods.6Brieﬂy, equal amounts of total protein for each sample were loaded on 10% SDS- polyacrylamide gels.
After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the blots were subsequently probed with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-SMI 31 (1:2,000; Covance), rabbit anti-phosphorylated Akt (Ser 473, 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti-Akt (1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homologdeleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN, Ser 380/Thr 382/383, 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-PTEN (1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technol- ogy), rabbit anti-phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, Ser 2448, 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-mTOR (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), rat anti-MBP (1:2,000; Millipore), rabbit anti- carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A, 1:1,000; Millipore) and CPT2 (1:1,000; Millipore), and mouse monoclonal anti- β-actin (1:10,000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).
Protein levels of PTEN, Akt, mTOR, and β-actin were used as internal controls. Western blots were performed from at least three individual experiments.Image Acquisition and Quanti ﬁcation For histologic experiments, the number of stained cells and the density of axons were analyzed in three coronal sections at 200 μm intervals in each rat brain.Two images in the corpus callosum per section were acquired, and ss-DNA-positive cells were counted in the entire area of the corpus callosum.A confocal microscope (LEICA TCS SP5 II, Leica Microsystems) with a 40 × objective was used to acquire the images.Images wereanalyzed using the National Institutes of Health Image analysis program version 1.43, as described previously.17Brieﬂy, the pNFH+-MBP+areas wereL-carnitine effects on axonal plasticity Y Ueno et al 383 © 2015 ISCBFM Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2015), 382 –391 split into green and red channels, and images showing common positive areas in both channels were obtained.
The intensity levels were then digitally adjusted with pixel intensity thresholds (black pixels represent pNFH+-MBP+immunoreactive areas). The total area of black pixels was divided by the total area in each image to estimate the degree of axonalplasticity and myelination after LBCCA.Electron microscopy image analysis involved estimating the number of myelinated axons in the corpus callosum.Only myelinated axon pro ﬁles with diameters greater than 0.5μm were included in the counts.22Thirty to forty axons were randomly counted in prede ﬁned bilateral areas of the corpus callosum in each rat brain.All in vivo experiments and measurements were performed in a blinded and randomized manner.Statistical Analysis Values presented in this study are expressed as mean ± standard error.Allstatistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for theSocial Sciences (version 15; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Student ’st-test and one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests were used when comparing two groups and greater than two groups, respectively. Chi- square tests were used for comparisons of the number of axons accordingto the axonal diameter among groups.A probability value of o0.05 was considered as signi ﬁcant.RESULTS Temporal Changes in Cerebral Blood Flow after Ligation of Both Common Carotid Arteries Figure 1A shows the temporal changes in CBF in each group.After LBCCA, CBF gradually increased in the vehicle- and L-carnitine-treated rats up to 28 days after LBCCA.There were no signi ﬁcant differences in CBF between the vehicle and L-carnitine-treated rats.Effects of L-Carnitine on Learning Memory and Motor Function Before LBCCA, the majority of the rats escaped within 10 seconds after training in the Morris water maze task.The escape latencies of the sham-operated group were within 10 seconds up to 28 daysafter LBCCA.
The escape latency of the vehicle group graduallyincreased from 7 to 28 days after LBCCA. At 21 and 28 days after LBCCA, the escape latency of the vehicle group signi ﬁcantly increased compared with the sham-operated group ( Po0.01, Figure 1B).The L-carnitine-treated rats exhibited shorter latencies than the vehicle-treated group.In particular, at 21 and 28 days after LBCCA the escape latency was signi ﬁcantly different between the vehicle and L-carnitine groups ( Po0.05, Figure 1B).In the rotarod test, the step out latency did not change after LBCCA, and there were no signi ﬁcant differences among the sham-operated, vehicle-treated, and L-carnitine-treated rats at each time point(Figure 1C).These data suggest that L-carnitine improves cognitive dysfunction induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in the Morris water maze task, while motor function in the rotarodtest was not impaired after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.
L-carnitine Sustained Cell Viability in Corpus Callosum The ss-DNA staining experiments indicated that ss-DNA +cells were substantially increased from 7 to 28 days after LBCCA from baseline. However, L-carnitine signi ﬁcantly reduced the number of ss-DNA+cells at each time point after LBCCA compared with the vehicle group ( Po0.05, Figures 1D and 1E).L-carnitine Enhances Axonal Plasticity after Chronic Hypoperfusion The pNFH is an abundant architectural cytoskeletal element in axons, participates in axonal growth, and regulates synapticfunction.23,24On western blot analysis, pNFH density decreased at 14 and 28 days after LBCCA in the vehicle-treated rats.However, L-carnitine signi ﬁcantly increased the density of pNFH compared with the vehicle-treated rats at 28 days after LBCCA ( Po0.05,Figures 2A and 2B).
A signi ﬁcant decrease in phosphorylated phosphatase and PTEN at 28 days after LBCCA was observed in L-carnitine-treated rats compared with vehicle-treated rats (Po0.05, Figure 3A), together with an elevation of phosphory- lated Akt and phosphorylated mTOR ( Po0.05, Figures 3B and 3C). Our data suggest that L-carnitine enhances pNFH expression related to regulation of the PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.L-carnitine Reduces Lipid Peroxidation and Oxidative DNA Damage in Oligodendrocytes MBP is a marker of mature oligodendrocytes.Our data show that MBP levels gradually decreased in vehicle-treated rats and increase in L-carnitine-treated rats from baseline after LBCCA.At 28 days after LBCCA, L-carnitine signi ﬁcantly increases MBP levels compared with vehicle-treated rats ( Po0.05, Figures 2A and 2C).
The number of oligodendrocytes in vehicle-treated rats signi ﬁ- cantly decreased from baseline at 28 days after LBCCA, while the number of oligodendrocytes in L-carnitine-treated rats was notsubstantially altered ( Po0.05, Figures 2D and 2E). To examine oxidative stress in WMLs after LBCCA, lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage were assessed using HNE and 8OHdGstaining, respectively.In the vehicle-treated group, HNE +cells gradually but substantially increased at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after LBCCA compared with the sham-operated group ( Po0.001, Figures 4A and 4B).In the L-carnitine-treated group, HNE+cells also increased at each time point after LBCCA.However, HNE+ cells were signi ﬁcantly decreased at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after LBCCA compared with the vehicle-treated group ( Po0.05, Figures 4A and 4B).In the vehicle-treated group, 8OHdG+cells were substantially increased at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days compared withthe sham-operated group ( Po0.001, Figures 4C and 4D).
L-carnitine signi ﬁcantly reduced the number of 8OHdG+cells compared with the vehicle-treated group, and there were nosigni ﬁcant differences in the number of 8OHdG+cells between the sham-operated group and the L-carnitine-treated group ( Po0.01, Figures 4C and 4D). Previously, we showed that HNE+and 8OHdG+ cells in the corpus callosum were colocalized with GST-pi+cells, a marker of oligodendrocytes.6In the current study, HNE+cells were colocalized to GST-pi+oligodendrocytes (Figure 4E) after LBCCA.L-carnitine Enhances Myelin Sheath Growth and Facilitates Myelination of Axons To examine alterations in axon –oligodendrocyte interactions after LBCCA, we measured the diameter of myelin sheaths using doubleimmuno ﬂuorescence staining.The diameter of MBP+oligoden- drocyte processes decreased at 28 days after LBCCA in vehicle- treated rats from baseline levels ( Po0.05, Figure 5A).
However, L-carnitine substantially increased the diameter of MBP+myelin sheaths compared with vehicle-treated rats at 28 days ( Po0.001, Figure 5A). To analyze myelin sheath thickness in more detail, we used electron microscopy.After LBCCA, myelin sheath thickness invehicle-treated rats gradually decreased over time from baseline levels (Figure 5B).However, L-carnitine-treated rats exhibited substantially increased myelin sheath thickness after LBCCA(Figure 5B).Myelin sheaths in L-carnitine-treated rats were signi ﬁ- cantly thicker than those in sham-operated and vehicle-treated rats at 28 days after LBCCA ( Po0.001, Figure 5C).Concurrently, pNFH +axons were well myelinated by MBP+oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum of L-carnitine-treated rats ( Po0.05, Figure 5D).Thus, axonal damage and oxidative damage in oligo- dendrocytes were induced after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.
The aforementioned data suggest that continuous treatment withL-carnitine suppresses oxidative stress in oligodendrocytes after LBCCA, and enhances oligodendrocyte marker expression as well as axonal plasticity, thereby facilitating myelination of axons in thechronic stage of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.L-carnitine effects on axonal plasticity Y Ueno et al 384 Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2015), 382 –391 © 2015 ISCBFM Improvement of Carnitine Homeostasis To examine mitochondrial membrane transport function, CPT1A and CPT2, inner and outer mitochondrial membrane transporter enzymes, were analyzed using western blots. After LBCCA, proteinlevels of CPT1A and CPT2 decreased in vehicle-treated rats.L-carnitine signi ﬁcantly increased CPT1A and CPT2 levels at 28 days after LBCCA compared with vehicle-treated rats, indicat- ing that L-carnitine improves impairment of mitochondrial membrane function induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion Figure 1.

Thus, it is suggested that improved mitochondrial membrane function may be associated withincreased axonal plasticity and myelination after L-carnitinetreatment after LBCCA.DISCUSSION To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to examine the effect of L-carnitine against WMLs under chronic hypoperfusion.
The principal ﬁndings presented here were that, in a rat cerebralchronic hypoperfusion model, L-carnitine: enhanced pNFH levels related to the regulation of the PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway;suppressed lipid peroxidation products and oxidative DNAdamage; sustained cell viability; stimulated myelin sheath growth; facilitated myelination of pNFH +axons; improved mitochondrial membrane function in the corpus callosum; and improved spatiallearning and memory. Although CBF measured by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry does not directly represent tissue ﬂow in white matter, development of WMLs is linked to alterations in CBF.5–7In the acute phase, Figure 2.L-carnitine increases phosphorylated high molecular weight neuro ﬁlament (pNFH) and myelin basic protein (MBP) after chronic hypoperfusion.( A–C) pNFH and MBP levels were measured using western blots.β-Actin was used as an internal control.N=5/group.Values are expressed as mean ±s.e.#Po0.05 versus the vehicle-treated rats.

The chronic phase lasts 8 to 12 weeks after the acute phase and is characterized bycompensatory increases in CBF viacollateral vessels.5During the chronic phase, in ﬂammatory changes, oxidative stress, and astro- gliosis are induced in white matter, and the degree of histologic change in WMLs is consistent with the decreases in CBF.25Thecurrent data showed that continuous treatment with L-carnitine did not affect CBF but improved WMLs. Thus, it is suggested that L-carnitine exerted direct neuroprotective effects against LBCCA injury.Stroke induces an acute loss of pNFH+axons in mammalian brains.26Previously, it was reported that pNFH+axons were increased in the peri-infarct cortex during stroke recovery in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, and that Figure 3.L-carnitine regulates phosphorylation of PTEN, AKT, and mTOR in the corpus callosum of chronic hypoperfusion rats.

Additionally, phosphorylated Akt andmTOR were expressed in pNFH+axons.
Thus, this is the ﬁrst report to show that L-carnitine enhances pNFH in response to regulation of the PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in the corpus callosum of the rat chronic hypoperfusion model.Loss of oligodendrocytes and demyelination are pathologic hallmarks of ischemic white-matter disease, which is associated with vascular dementia.31HNE and 8OHdG proteins accumulate after ischemia.6,32MBP+processes in oligodendrocytes are acutely decreased after hypoxia-ischemia induced white-matter damage,whereas myelin sheath generation and axonal myelination are facilitated during the chronic recovery stage in ischemic rats.18,33 Our data show that L-carnitine substantially suppresses the production of HNE and 8OHdG in oligodendrocytes after chronichypoperfusion. Intriguingly, continuous treatment with L-carnitine increases MBP expression and axonal myelination from baseline levels.
Although stroke mediates free radical formation and injuresoligodendrocytes and axons, the current data suggest thatL-carnitine not only exerts an antioxidant effect through the suppression of lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage, but may also facilitate development and myelination of Figure 4. carnitine reduces oxidative stress in oligodendrocytes after chronic hypoperfusion.( A) Representative images of 4-hydroxy-2- nonenal (HNE) immunostaining show the accumulation of lipid peroxidation in oligodendrocytes at 14 and 28 days post ligation of the bilateral common carotid arteries (LBCCA) in vehicle-treated and L-carnitine (LCAR)-treated rats.( B) Quantitation of HNE+cell numbers in the corpus callosum.( C) Representative images of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) immunostaining show oxidative DNA damage in oligodendrocytes at 14 and 28 days in vehicle-treated and L-carnitine-treated rats.( D) Quantitation of 8OHdG+cell numbers in the corpus callosum.

36L-carnitine functions in the mito- chondria in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix and facilitates β-oxidation.37L-carnitineprevented the reduction of CPT1 and CPT2 after oxygen-glucose deprivation in cultured hippocampal slices.38CPT1C regulates dendritic spine maturation and is related to cognitive function in mice.39Our data have shown that continuous treatment with L-carnitine ameliorates mitochondrial inner and outer membranedysfunction after chronic hypoperfusion. The present study istheﬁrst to show that impairment of mitochondrial membrane function is implicated as an essential mechanism of WMLs induced by chronic hypoperfusion, and that L-carnitine improves Figure 5.L-carnitine increases myelin sheath thickness after chronic hypoperfusion.

The current study provides evidence that L-carnitine improves mitochondrialmembrane dysfunction and alleviates oxidative stress, therebyenhancing axonal plasticity and oligodendrocytic axonal myelina- tion, which is likely to form the basis of the neuroprotective effects of L-carnitine against WMLs and cognitive impairment.
