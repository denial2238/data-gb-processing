Design: Data from eight representative household surveys were used to assess VAS coverage. Multivariable logistic regression models examined the effect of rural/urban residence, child sex and age, caregiver education, COVID-19 concern andhousehold wealth on VAS status.Setting: Nine (2019) and 12 (2020) districts in Burkina Faso, Côte d ’Ivoire, Guinea and Mali.Participants: 28 283 caregivers of children aged 6 –59 months.Results: Between 2019 and 2020, VAS coverage increased in Burkina Faso (82·2 – 93·1 %), Côte d ’Ivoire (90·3 –93·3 %) and Mali (76·1 –79·3 %) and decreased in Guinea (86·0 % to 81·7 %).Rural children had a higher likelihood of VAS uptakecompared with urban children in Burkina Faso (adjusted OR (aOR) =4·22; 95 % CI: 3·11, 5·72), Côte d ’Ivoire (aOR =5·19; 95 % CI: 3·10, 8·70) and Mali (aOR =1·41; 95 % CI: 1·15, 1·74).
Children aged 12 –59 months had a higher likelihood of VAS uptake compared with children aged 6 –11 months in Côte d ’Ivoire (aOR =1·67; 95 % CI: 1·12, 2·48) and Mali (aOR =1·74; 95 % CI: 1·34, 2·26). Moderate-to-high COVID-19 concern was associated with a lower likelihood of VAS uptake in Côted’Ivoire (aOR =0·55; 95 % CI: 0·37, 0·80).Conclusion: The increase in VAS coverage from 2019 to 2020 suggests that COVID-19 concerns may not have limited VAS uptake in some African countries, thoughgeographic inequities should be considered.Keywords Children COVID-19 Sub-Saharan Africa Supplementation Vitamin A Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is of significant public health concern in areas where nutritionally poor diets inhibitadequate consumption of vital nutrients for good health.Contributing to child malnutrition, VAD poses particularlyserious consequences for children under 5 years of age (1).
VAD remains highly prevalent in much of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where upwards of 50 % of children aged 6 –59 months are affected(2). In 2019, central, eastern and western SSA had the highest age-standardised incidence anddisability-adjusted life years rates of VAD, with rates of15 571 per 100 000 and 37 per 100 000, respectively, inwestern SSA (3).The WHO strongly recommends vitamin A supplemen- tation (VAS) for infants and children of 6 –59 months of age in areas where VAD is a public health problem(4).Recent evidence suggests a 12 % decrease in all-cause mortality anddiarrhoea-specific mortality and significant reductions in theincidence of diarrhoea, measles, Bitot ’s spots, night blind- ness and VAD in children under 5 years of age who receive biannual VAS (1).
Helen Keller International and partner organisations work with governments throughout SSA todistribute VAS, mainly through semiannual door-to-doorhealth events, and to support the integration of VAS intoessential health service packages at the community level.Public Health Nutrition: 26(10), 1935 –1943 doi:10.1017/S1368980023001258 *Corresponding author : Email mbaker@hki.org © The Author(s), 2023.

Though reported VAS coverage in some SSA countriesexceeded 80 % prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (6), little is known about the effects of pandemic-related challenges and mitigation measures implemented by national govern-ments and supporting international organisations on VAS coverage. Available data indicate that two-dose VAS coverage was substantially lower in 2020, as comparedwith pre-pandemic levels, in SSA and South Asia, with onlyapproximately 40 % of targeted children reached and the lowest reported coverage in Central and West Africa (6).However, these coverage estimates are based on reportedcountry administrative data, which have shown to be unreliable when compared with other assessment meth- ods (7).This study aimed to assess VAS coverage among children aged 6 –59 months in 2019 and 2020 and explore the key factors that influenced VAS uptake in 2020, including COVID-19 perceptions, in Burkina Faso, Côted’Ivoire, Guinea and Mali.
Methods Study design and population This cross-sectional study utilised data from eight Post- Event Coverage Surveys (PECS) conducted in BurkinaFaso, Côte d ’Ivoire, Guinea and Mali during 2019 and 2020. All surveys were conducted within 6 weeks following door- to-door health events that included VAS distribution in eachcountry.In 2019, PECS were conducted in each countrybetween June and July.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, periods of data collection varied throughout 2020, with PECS administered in July/August (Guinea), October (Mali)and December 2020/January 2021 (Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire).Each survey employed a randomised cluster design with enumeration areas selected using probability proportional to size sampling methodology.
Numbers of survey strata, clusters and households varied by country in 2019 and2020; however, the same design effect (2·5), non-responseinflation factor (1·02), response rate (0·98), intracluster correlation coefficient (0·167), desired level of precision (0·95), alpha (0·05) and expected coverage (0·80) wereconsistent across all PECS. Survey enumeration areas in each stratum were randomly selected by the respective National Institute of Statistics in each country.Householdswere randomly selected from household lists in each cluster and were eligible to participate if there was a primary child caregiver present at the time of the surveyand at least one child in the household was aged 6 –59 months during the preceding health event.
PECS were conducted by experienced and trained interviewers who were independent from the VAS distribution activities.Training tools and modalities were adapted to incorporate COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures andto sensitise interviewers on adherence to COVID-19protocols. Additionally, survey supervisors visited 10 % of sampled households in each cluster to administer a shortened PECS to verify the data collected in the primarysurveys.Administrative systems in t he study countries include a hierarchy of national, regi onal and local authorities.Structured according to functional and geographic responsibilities, the system includes ministries, regionalauthorities, and several health districts within each regionthat include urban and rural areas.
Each country is uniquein that different levels of the administrative systemmanage specific aspects of the VAS distribution and the P E C S .I nB u r k i n aF a s o ,M a l ia n dG u i n e a ,o v e r s i g h to fV A S distribution and the PECS is at the regional level, whereasoversight is done at the health district level in Côted’Ivoire. Of the 13 regions in Burkina Faso, the PECS was representative of three in 2019 and five in 2020.In Mali,five of the 11 regions were represented in 2019 and 2020.Of the 113 health districts in Côte d ’Ivoire, the PECS was representative of 71 health districts in 2019 and 72 healthdistricts in 2020.In Guinea, the PECS was nationallyrepresentative in 2019 and 2020.In all countries, both the2019 and 2020 PECS included questions on: householdsocio-demographic characteristics; health-seeking practi- ces; health event/campai gn communication methods; vitamin A and VAS knowledge and attitudes; VAS status;and reasons for non-supplementation.
An additionalmodule in the 2020 PECS included questions related toCOVID-19 knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, as wellas compliance with infection control measures. Statistical analysis Survey data were electronica lly recorded using smart- phones and directly exported to Excel for preliminaryanalysis.Sampling weights were calculated to generate representative estimates for respective survey regions/ districts.SPSS Complex Samples 26.0 (IBM Corp) was used to conduct descriptive, bivariate and multivariable analyses.The study outcome was child VAS status, asdetermined from the child ’s health card or caregiver recall.Based on these data, VAS coverage estimates for 2019 and2020 were calculated for each country.Logistic regression models examined the effects of rurality, child sex and age, caregiver education, household wealth and level ofCOVID-19 concern on VAS status.
Model variables wereincluded based on a significant ( P<0·05) bivariate relationship and/or acknowledged association withVAS. Results are presented as OR with 95 % CI (α=0·05).Sample-weighted estimates are presented for all outcome results.Separate analyses were conducted foreach country.Ethical approval was obtained from therespective institutions in each country, and informed1936 MM Baker et al.consent was required from all survey respondents prior to participation.Results Data were collected from a total of n28 283 respondents across the eight surveys.The proportion of rural v.urban households varied across countries, with approximately80 % and 70 % of surveyed households in rural localities in Burkina Faso and Mali, respectively, and less than 50 % of households in rural areas in Côte d ’Ivoire and Guinea (Table 1).In all countries, the majority of respondents inthe 2019 and 2020 PECS were mothers.
The largest proportions of fathers, grandparents and other respondents were in Guinea in the 2019 (41·1 %) and 2020 (47·7 %)surveys. In Côte d ’Ivoire and Mali, there was an approximate 10 % decrease in the percentage of respon- dents who were mothers between 2019 and 2020.In allcountries, more than 90 % of mothers in the household were aged 20 years or older.The majority of mothers reported having no formal education, with the highestpercentage in Burkina Faso (73·1 % in 2019; 72·6 % in2020).Infants aged 6 –11 months comprised 9 –13 % of surveyed children and child sex parity was observed across all four countries, with the largest difference (52·6 % male v.47·4 % female) in Côte d ’Ivoire in 2020 (Table 1).In 2020, 40·4 % of households in Burkina Faso, 42·7 % in Côte d’Ivoire, 39·9 % in Guinea and 54·5 % in Mali were classified as having very poor or poor wealth status.In the 2020 surveys, the majority of respondents in all countries expressed concern about COVID-19.
Approximately onein five respondents in Côte d ’Ivoire, Guinea and Mali and almost one-quarter (24·1 %) in Burkina Faso reported being very concerned about COVID-19, while 8·3 % of respon- dents in Burkina Faso, 11·2 % in Côte d ’Ivoire, 15·7 % in Guinea and 10·8 % in Mali reporting not being concerned (Table 2). Notwithstanding the level of COVID-19 concern, more than 90 % of respondents in all countries reportedthey were willing for their child(ren) to receive VAS at the household (Table 2).In 2019, VAS coverage among children aged 6 –59 months ranged from 76·1 % in Mali to 90·3 % in Côted’Ivoire (Table 3).VAS coverage was higher in 2020, as compared with 2019, in Burkina Faso (93·1 % v.82·2 %), Côte d ’Ivoire (93·3 % v.90·3 %) and Mali (79·3 % v.76·1 %).In Guinea, a 4·3 % decrease in VAS coverage was observed between 2019 (86·0 %) and 2020 (81·7 %) (Table 3).
In 2020, VAS coverage in the four countries was significantlyhigher among children in rural households, as compared with those in urban households (Burkina Faso: 93·4 % v. 81·0 %, P<0·001; Côte d ’Ivoire: 98·2 % v.90·5 %, P<0·001; Guinea: 85·9 % v.64·8 %, P<0·001; Mali: 81·3 % v.72·1 %, P<0·001) and was higher among children aged 24 –59 months, as compared with those aged 6 –11 months in Guinea (83·3 % v.71·1 %, P<0·001) and Mali (80·7 % v.71·0 %, P<0·001).No differences in VAS coverage were observed between male and female children in any of thefour countries.VAS coverage was lowest among children in the wealthiest household category in Burkina Faso (P=0·026), Côte d ’Ivoire ( P<0·001), Guinea ( P<0·001) and Mali ( P<0·001) and was lowest among children of caregivers with the highest level of education in Burkina Faso ( P=0·028), Côte d ’Ivoire ( P=0·036) and Mali (P<0·001).
Among children in households reporting a high level of COVID-19 concern, VAS coverage was 91·9 % in Burkina Faso, 91·5 % in Côte d ’Ivoire, 85·9 % in Guinea and 78·1 % in Mali. In Mali, VAS coverage was 9·3 % higher (78·1 % v.68·8 %, P=0·029) for children in highly concerned households, as compared with not concernedhouseholds.Approximately 10 % more caregivers in rural, as compared with urban, households reported willingness for their child(ren) to receive VAS at the household inBurkina Faso, Côte d ’Ivoire and Mali, whereas this difference was approximately 20 % in Guinea.In Burkina Faso, Côte d ’Ivoire and Mali, the most frequently reported reason for children not receiving VAS during both the 2019 and 2020 events was health workers not coming to the household to provide VAS (Table 4).
InGuinea, the child being absent at the time of supplemen- tation (41·2 %) and health workers not coming to administer VAS at the household (55·7 %) were the mostcommonly mentioned barriers to supplementation during the 2019 and 2020 events, respectively. In 2020, the child not being present at the time of VAS distribution wasreported by approximately 30 % of respondents in Côte d’Ivoire.In Mali, about 20 % of respondents reported not being informed about VAS and/or the health event, while inBurkina Faso 12 –15 % of respondents cited a lack of VAS supply as the reason for non-supplementation.VAS refusal ranged from <0·5 % of households in Burkina Faso in 2019 and 2020 to 13·6 % of households in the 2019 Guinea survey (Table 4).Mask wearing by health workers distributing VAS at the household during the 2020 eventswas observed by 86·9 % of respondents in Burkina Faso, 84·5 % in Côte d ’Ivoire, 72·6 % in Guinea and 67·0 % in Mali.
As we could not statistically compare 2019 and 2020 coverage estimates due to country sampling variations, the following findings were generated from adjusted models that included data from the 2020 surveys. Children in ruralareas had a higher likelihood of receiving VAS, as compared with those in urban areas, in Burkina Faso (OR =4·22; 95 % CI: 3·11, 5·72), Côte d ’Ivoire (OR =5·19; 95 % CI: 3·10, 8·70), Guinea (OR = 2·94; 95 % CI: 2·30, 3·77) and Mali (OR =1·41; 95 % CI: 1·15, 1·74) (Table 5).Children aged 12 –59 months were more likely to receive VAS, as compared with thoseaged 6 –11 months, in Côte d ’Ivoire (OR =1·67; 95 % CI: 1·12, 2·48), Guinea (OR =1·93; 95 % CI: 1·34, 2·77) and Mali (OR=1·74; 95 % CI: 1·34, 2·26).
In Mali, caregiver education was associated with a higher likelihood of child VAS (OR=1·26; 95 % CI: 1·04, 1·53), while children in the middle household wealth (OR =0·45; 95 % CI: 0·37, 0·54) andCOVID-19 concerns among caregivers and vitamin A supplementation coverage among children 1937 Table 1 Participant characteristics Burkina Faso Côte d ’Ivoire Guinea Mali 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 n3432 n5587 n4647 n3346 n2526 n2727 n2221 n3797 n % n % n % n % n % n % n % n % Relationship to child Mother 2661 77·6 4061 72·9 3396 73·1 2094 62·6 1486 58·8 1426 52·3 1678 75·6 2407 63·4 Father 297 8·7 462 8·3 568 12·2 533 15·9 347 13·7 562 20·6 163 7·3 688 18·1 Grandparent 203 5·9 440 7·9 377 8·1 324 9·7 197 7·8 294 10·8 123 5·5 369 9·7Other 270 7·9 605 10·9 306 6·6 395 11·8 496 19·6 445 16·3 257 11·6 333 8·8 Mother ’s age 15–19 years 68 2·6 142 3·5 98 3·1 64 3·2 98 7·4 74 5·2 91 5·4 91 3·8 20–24 years 556 20·9 811 20·0 626 19·7 341 17·0 246 18·7 290 20·3 383 22·8 436 18·1 25–29 years 720 27·1 1004 24·7 791 24·9 485 24·2 339 25·8 346 24·3 463 27·6 569 23·6 30–34 years 602 22·6 963 23·7 727 22·9 478 23·9 211 16·0 230 16·1 340 20·3 506 21·0 >=35 years 676 25·4 990 24·4 933 29·4 636 31·7 421 32·0 261 18·3 359 21·4 652 27·1 Mother ’s educational status None 1945 73·1 2950 72·6 2083 61·4 1095 52·4 627 42·5 876 61·4 1045 62·3 1658 68·9Primary 382 14·4 671 16·5 807 23·8 550 26·3 238 16·1 165 11·6 424 25·3 415 17·2 Secondary or higher 334 12·6 440 10·8 502 14·8 446 21·4 460 31·2 267 18·7 209 12·5 334 13·9 Sex of child Male 1675 51·6 2802 50·3 2322 50·0 1759 52·6 1292 51·1 1399 51·3 1133 51·0 1961 51·6Female 1569 48·4 2766 49·7 2325 50·0 1587 47·4 1234 48·9 1328 48·7 1088 49·0 1836 48·4 Age of child 6–11 months 416 12·8 575 10·3 602 13·0 389 11·6 296 11·7 252 9·2 239 10·8 351 9·2 12–23 months 756 23·3 1255 22·5 1246 26·8 839 25·1 490 19·4 579 21·2 488 22·0 866 22·8 24–35 months 698 21·5 1309 23·5 1085 23·3 799 23·9 583 23·1 657 24·1 510 23·0 884 23·3 36–47 months 660 20·3 1204 21·6 1079 23·2 760 22·7 565 22·4 622 22·8 536 24·1 890 23·4 48–59 months 714 22·0 1225 22·0 635 13·7 559 16·7 592 23·4 617 22·6 448 20·2 806 21·2 Area of residence Rural 2715 79·1 4433 79·3 2160 46·5 1203 36·0 850 33·7 1316 48·3 1510 68·0 2852 75·1 Urban 691 20·1 1154 20·7 2487 53·5 2143 64·0 1676 66·3 1411 51·7 711 32·0 945 24·91938 MM Baker et al.
highest wealth (OR =0·37; 95 % CI: 0·30, 0·46) categories had a lower likelihood of VAS. A moderate to high level ofcaregiver concern regarding COVID-19 was associated witha lower likelihood of child VAS only in Côte d ’Ivoire in both the unadjusted (OR =0·50; 95 % CI: 0·34, 0·72) and multi- variable (adjusted OR (aOR) =0·55; 95 % CI: 0·37, 0·80) models (Table 5).A further exploration of COVID-19concerns by socio-economic position in Côte d ’Ivoire revealed that middle (OR =1·40; 95 % CI: 1·12, 1·74) and highest (OR =1·66; 95 % CI: 1·38, 1·98) wealth households were more likely to have a moderate/high level ofCOVID-19 concern, as compared with the lowest wealth households.In addition, rural households were less likely to have a moderate/high level of COVID-19 concern, ascompared with urban households (OR =0·75; 95 % CI: 0·64, 0·88).
Discussion We sought to assess VAS coverage and examine the influence of key factors, including COVID-19 concerns,on VAS uptake among children aged 6 –59 months in four countries in SSA. The higher VAS coverage observed in 2020, as compared with pre-pandemic levels, in threecountries was unexpected.Global evidence (based onadministrative data) from the same time period suggests the suspension of door-to-door (mass campaign) health events caused a 19 % decrease in two-dose VAS coveragein 2020, as compared with 2019, particularly during thefirst half of the year which subsequently impacted two- dose VAS coverage in 2020 (8).Despite the challenges imposed by the pandemic, Helen Keller Internationalmanaged to promote, facilitate and support the distribu-tion of VAS through two rounds of door-to-door health events within most supported countries in 2020, albeit while respecting the mitiga tion measures recommended by WHO and country governments.
Standard supple-mentation procedures were followed in Helen KellerInternational-supported programmes in Burkina Faso,Côte d ’Ivoire and Mali during the pandemic, with the addition of COVID-19 infection control measures. In Guinea, VAS distribution modalities changed during thefirst campaign round in 2020 from a pre-pandemic 5-ddistribution event to a multi-phased approach targetingdifferent districts over a 2-month period.This altereddelivery strategy may have contributed to the lower VAS coverage observed in Guinea in 2020, as compared with 2019.Furthermore, in Guinea, a higher percentage ofsurvey respondents were non-mothers which could haveaffected knowledge and or recall of children ’s supple- mentation status.A possible explanation for the higher-than-expected VAS coverage observed during the pandemic in our study isapprehensions surrounding COVID-19 did not negativelyimpact VAS uptake in areas supported by Helen KellerInternational where VAS distribution occurred.
There mayhave been increased propensity towards positive health-seeking behaviours due to heightened health and safety awareness from media and other sources, in addition to intensive mobilisation efforts by Helen Keller Internationaland partners that incorporated strategies to sensitisecommunities and adopt infection prevention and controlmeasures during door-to-door visits (9). This is further supported by the vast majority (83 –94 %) of respondents affirming they could reduce COVID-19 transmission through their own actions.
In addition to communityknowledge about vitamin A and its importance for childhealth, the likely greater attention to hygiene/diseaseprevention during the pandemic may have bolsteredparental willingness for VAS to protect children fromTable 2 Level of COVID-19 concern and attitudes towards vitamin A supplementation among caregivers of children aged 6 –59 months Burkina Faso Côte d ’Ivoire Guinea Mali n5177 n3072 n2727 n3797 %C I%C I%C I%C I Level of concern about COVID-19 Not concerned 8·3 7·5, 9·2 11·2 10·2, 12·4 15·7 14·2, 17·5 10·8 9·8, 11·8 A bit concerned 20·3 18·9, 21·9 16·1 14·9, 17·5 18·6 17·0, 20·4 11·5 10·5, 12·6Concerned 47·3 45·5, 49·1 53·3 51·5, 55·0 45·6 43·5, 47·8 57·1 55·5, 58·7Very concerned 24·1 22·6, 25·7 19·4 18·0, 20·8 20·0 18·3, 21·8 20·6 19·3, 21·9 Willingness for child to receive VAS at home Yes 93·8 92·8, 94·6 91·7 90·7, 92·7 95·9 95·0, 96·7 93·5 92·6, 94·3No 6·2 5·4, 7·2 8·3 7·3, 9·3 4·1 3·3, 5·0 6·5 5·7, 7·4 Table 3 VAS coverage among children aged 6 –59 months during 2019 and 2020 campaigns 2019 2020 %C I%C I Burkina Faso 82·2 80·8, 83·6 93·1 92·2, 93·9 Côte d ’Ivoire 90·3 88·7, 91·7 93·3 92·4, 94·1 Guinea 86·0 84·3, 87·6 81·7 80·0, 83·2 Mali 76·1 74·2, 78·0 79·3 77·9, 80·6COVID-19 concerns among caregivers and vitamin A supplementation coverage among children 1939 illness at a time when access to routine health services was especially limited.
Furthermore, across the four countries,high VAS coverage (78 –92 %) was observed among households reporting a high level of concern about COVID-19. Though this was unexpected, as 65 –78 % of households expressed being concerned or very concerned about COVID-19, these findings further support the likelihood that pandemic-related fears did not greatlyaffect perceptions and attitudes towards VAS in these settings.Though the precise reasons for the lower VAS coverage observed in Guinea in 2020 are not known, the large proportion of caregivers who reported that their child(ren) did not receive VAS due to health workers not coming totheir community suggests that logistical constraints, perhaps worsened by pandemic-related challenges, may have played a greater role in Guinea.
Notwithstanding, thelack of distribution in target areas was also the primary reported barrier to VAS receipt in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Mali and reduced accessibility due to geographic, pandemic and/or other factors presumably affected VAS delivery in all countries. Though community outreach challenges were likely exacerbated during thepandemic, our findings are consistent with results from other studies conducted prior to the pandemic indicating that households not being reached during door-to-doorcampaigns is a key contributor to missed VAS doses in the SSA context (10,11).In 2020, VAS coverage was >90 % in Burkina Faso and Côte d ’Ivoire and approximately 80 % in Guinea and Mali.Though these levels meet the WHO/UNICEF guidelines for at least 80 % coverage as a measure of effective VASprogramming, subnational disparities and socio-economic inequities remain, particularly between rural and urban areas.
In 2020, VAS coverage was 10 –20 % higher in rural, as compared with urban, areas across the four countries. A possible reason for this disparity may be poorer acces- sibility in densely populated urban areas that wasexacerbated by pandemic-related disruptions in health services.Apart from the unique challenges imposed by COVID-19, mixed evidence exists for the associationbetween rural/urban residence and VAS, with both higher rural and urban coverage observed in different settings (11 –18).In our study, a higher level of caregiver education and increased household wealth were not predictors of VAS uptake in Burkina Faso, Côte d ’Ivoire and Guinea, while caregiver education was positively associated with VAS in Mali.
Although these were unexpected findings, it is possible that caregivers with a higher level of education didnot consider VAS to be necessary, whereas households with a lower socio-economic status may have been more willing for their children to receive VAS due to increasedperceptions of vulnerability to illness, particularly during the pandemic.
Additionally, heightened COVID-19 con- cern among more educated individuals could haveTable 4 Reasons for children aged 6 –59 months not receiving vitamin A supplementation during 2019 and 2020 campaigns Burkina Faso Côte d ’Ivoire Guinea Mali 2019 ( n563) 2020 ( n481) 2019 ( n310) 2020 ( n225) 2019 ( n382) 2020 ( n647) 2019 ( n516) 2020 ( n781) % CI % CI % CI % CI % CI % CI % CI % CI Reason for non-VAS Child absent 13·9 11·2, 17·1 21·8 17·0, 27·6 18·7 13·1, 25·9 29·9 24·2, 36·3 41·2 34·8, 47·9 22·2 18·4, 26·5 16·6 13·4, 20·3 9·9 8·0, 12·3Child sick 0·2 0·0, 0·7 1·1 0·3, 4·0 3·3 0·7, 13·3 0·4 0·1, 3·0 3·0 1·2, 7·4 0·1 0·0, 0·6 0·8 0·3, 2·1 0·4 0·1, 1·4Health workers did not come to house 67·0 62·9, 70·9 44·5 38·5, 50·7 73·9 65·1, 81·2 56·3 49·6, 62·7 27·8 22·5, 33·8 55·7 50·9, 60·5 54·4 49·9, 58·8 67·7 64 ·2, 71·0 No VAS supply 14·5 11·7, 17·8 12·4 7·9, 19·0 N/A N/A 0·5 0·1, 1·7 1·2 0·4, 3·1 4·2 2·8, 6·4 0·8 0·4, 1·8 Not informed 6·5 4·7, 9·0 16·5 12·0, 22·3 0·4 0·1, 1·6 6·4 3·9, 10·4 6·9 4·5, 10·4 3·2 1·8, 5·5 20·4 17·1, 24·1 17·4 14·8, 20·5Refused 0·2 0·0, 1·3 0·2 0·1, 0·9 0·7 0·2, 2·5 5·9 3·4, 9·9 13·6 9·7, 18·6 6·5 4·5, 9·4 1·9 1·0, 3·8 3·0 1·9, 4·7 N/A: Data not collected.1940 MM Baker et al.
influenced decisions surrounding child VAS at the house- hold, as evident in Côte d ’Ivoire where wealthier urban households had increased apprehensions aboutCOVID-19, as compared with poorer rural households. Therefore, our findings suggest good VAS compliance across socio-economic strata, also possibly due to effectivecommunity sensitisation strategies.While our findingscontrast with available evidence from SSA indicating higherVAS uptake among advantaged children with educatedmothers and wealthier households (12,14 –21), large multi- country studies tend to pool data from various delivery models, thereby potentially masking key contributors toVAS uptake.We hypothesise that education and wealthstatus may not be key determinants of VAS coverage indoor-to-door delivery models, but rather more significantfactors in facility-based programmes that require active seeking of health services.
In a pooled analysis of 44 PECS conducted in 13 SSA countries, caregivers with some formaleducation were more likely to have brought their childrento a fixed site for VAS and less likely to have their childrenreceive VAS during door-to-door distribution events (11). In Côte d ’Ivoire, Guinea and Mali, children aged 12 months and older had a higher likelihood of VAS, ascompared with infants 6 –11 months of age.Similarly, a pooled analysis of Demographic and Health Surveysconducted from 2011 to 2015 in 23 SSA countries showedchildren aged 12 –23 months (OR =1·63; 95 % CI: 1·58, 1·69) and 24 –35 months (OR =1·38; 95 % CI: 1·34, 1·43) were more likely to receive VAS, as compared with thoseaged 6 –11 months (14).
The lower VAS coverage observed for children under one year of age in our study couldindicate challenges reaching these youngest childrenduring the campaigns and/or that these infants may have been provided VAS during their routine childhoodimmunisation visits in the months preceding the survey. A key strength of our study was the inclusion of data representative at the regional/district level from four countries in the West African region.In addition, VASdistribution followed a similar door-to-door delivery modelin all countries, and standard survey design, sampling anddata collection methods were employed in all regions.The6-week time interval between VAS distributions and the post-event household surveys likely minimised the effect of recall bias.As PECS are cross-sectional, we examinedassociations between VAS and explanatory variables butcould not infer causality.
Though we controlled forpotential confounding variables, there may have beeninfluences from other factors not accounted for in the study. We could not statistically compare 2019 and 2020 coverage estimates due to country sampling variations.Moreover,the results should not be compared across countries as theindividual surveys were not designed to detect inter-country differences.The time of year during which VASdistribution occurred varied within and across countries, which could have affected VAS delivery mechanisms and coverage.The limited information available in our studyregarding disruptions in service delivery due to COVID-19that could have affected VAS coverage in our settingsshould be considered.In addition, as the PECS assesseddoor-to-door VAS coverage, we were not able to captureVAS doses administered at health facilities or other fixed sites.
Lastly, our findings should be considered with the caveat that surveys and administrative records servedistinct purposes with different populations, sampling,Table 5 Multivariable regression associations between predictor variables and vitamin A supplementation among children aged 6 –59 months during 2020 campaigns Burkina Faso Côte d ’Ivoire Guinea Mali AOR CI AOR CI AOR CI AOR CI Concern about COVID-19 No/low (ref) –––––––– Moderate/high* 1·15 0·85, 1·54 0·55 0·37, 0·80 1·04 0·82, 1·33 1·12 0·91, 1·38 Area of residence Urban (ref) –––––– – – Rural 4·22 3·11, 5·72 5·19 3·10, 8·70 2·94 2·30, 3·77 1·41 1·15, 1·74 Sex of child Male (ref) –––––––– Female 1·00 0·77, 1·32 0·92 0·69, 1·23 0·89 0·71, 1·11 0·95 0·80, 1·12 Age of child 6–11 months (ref) –––––––– 12–59 months 1·39 0·94, 2·06 1·67 1·12, 2·48 1·93 1·34, 2·77 1·74 1·34, 2·26 Caregiver education None (ref) –––––––– Any 1·27 0·92, 1·76 0·97 0·73, 1·29 1·12 0·88, 1·42 1·26 1·04, 1·53 Wealth category Lowest (ref) –––––––– Middle 0·80 0·56, 1·14 0·94 0·61, 1·45 1·00 0·74, 1·37 0·45 0·37, 0·54 Highest 0·99 0·72, 1·36 0·95 0·66, 1·37 0·77 0·56, 1·05 0·37 0·30, 0·46 AOR, adjusted OR.

This isespecially important during public health crises whenservice disruptions further exacerbate health disparities and prevent equitable coverage in certain areas. Targeted post-pandemic efforts are needed for missed VAS doses,ideally provided with other essential child health services, including immunisations, deworming and screening for acute malnutrition.Achieving substantial reductions inchild mortality requires children aged 6 –59 months to receive twice-yearly vitamin A supplements where VAD is a public health problem, such as in these study settings.Though our findings suggest high coverage can beachieved during a public health crisis, local factors that may have affected programme implementation during the pandemic should be considered, along with targeted effortsfor hard-to-reach areas.
