Furthermore, patients with obesity and cardiovascular disease are more likely to have suboptimal vitamin B6 status than healthy people. Therefore, we investigated the e ﬀects of dietary vitamin B6 restriction on hepatic gene expression and function in obese mice.C57BL /6J male mice were fed a low-fat (LF) or high-fat (HF) diet in combination with suﬃcient (7 mg pyridoxine /kg diet) or insu ﬃcient (1 mg) amounts of vitamin B6 for 16 weeks.Analysis of microarray data revealed that expressions of 4000 genes were signiﬁcantly altered by the experimental diets (LF7, LF1, HF7, and HF1).The e ﬀects of dietary fat content on gene expressions were markedly greater than vitamin B6 content.Only three di ﬀerentially expressed genes (DEGs) were overlapped between the LF1 /LF7 and HF1 /HF7 comparison.
In the LF1 /LF7 comparison, 54 upregulated DEGs were enriched in gene ontology (GO) terms associated with the sterol metabolic process and 54 downregulated DEGs were enriched in GO terms associated with immune response. In HF1 /HF7 comparison, 26 upregulated DEGs were enriched in GO terms associated with amino acid catabolic process.High-fat consumption downregulated gene expressions associated with vitamin B6-dependent pathways.In conclusion, our data suggest that obesity may di ﬀerentially regulate vitamin B6-associated metabolic pathways in the body.Keywords: amino acid metabolism; dietary vitamin B6 restriction; high-fat diet; immunity; mice; sterol metabolism; transcriptome 1.Introduction Epidemiological studies have reported that an insu ﬃcient intake of vitamin B6 and low plasma concentrations of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), a metabolically active form of vitamin B6, are associated with diabetes, neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [ 1–4].
Furthermore, vitamin B6 deﬁciency has been shown to alter both cell-mediated and humoral immunity [ 5,6]. PLP serves as a coenzyme of numerous enzymatic reactions in carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism through decarboxylation, transamination, racemization, elimination, and β-group interconversion [ 7].In particular, PLP plays a pivotal role in maintaining normal homocysteine levels by regulating the activities of PLP-dependent enzymes in transsulfuration and transmethylation pathways.Additionally, several studies have reported anti-oxidative [8] and anti-inﬂammatory [9] e ﬀects of vitamin B6.Since vitamin B6 is found in various foods, dietary vitamin B6 inadequacy is di ﬃcult to ﬁnd among people who eat regular diets.However, vitamin B6 insu ﬃciency is common [ 10–13] and could Nutrients 2020 ,12, 3821; doi:10.3390 /nu12123821 www.mdpi.com /journal /nutrients Nutrients 2020 ,12, 3821 2 of 10 be aggravated by a food-derived anti-pyridoxine factor [ 14].
Plasma PLP concentrations less than 20 nmol /L indicates deﬁciency and less than 30 nmol /L indicates marginal deﬁciency or insu ﬃciency in humans [11,15]. In animal studies of marginal deﬁciency induced by insu ﬃcient vitamin B6 supply, plasma concentrations of amino acids and lipophilic metabolites, such as N-acyl amino acids and bile acids, were signiﬁcantly changed [ 14,16,17].Similarly, plasma concentrations of several amino acids and their metabolites, including glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cystathionine, and glutathione, were signiﬁcantly changed in humans with marginal vitamin B6 deﬁciency [ 18–20].However, little is known about the e ﬀects of marginal vitamin B6 deﬁciency on the gene expression proﬁle in the liver.Furthermore, most studies on vitamin B6 deﬁciency have been conducted on healthy individuals or animals fed a control diet.
In this study, we compared the e ﬀect of dietary vitamin B6 restriction on hepatic transcriptome between non-obese and high-fat fed obese mice to investigate whether obesity may di ﬀerentially regulate vitamin B6-associated metabolic pathways in the body. 2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Animals and Diets Four-week old C57BL /6J male mice were purchased from Raon Bio (Yongin, Korea) and housed in a temperature (22 ±3◦C) and humidity (50 ±10%) controlled room with a 12 h light–dark cycle.After 12 days of acclimation [5 days with a chow diet and 7 days with a control low-fat (12% kcal from fat) diet with 7 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride (PN) /kg diet], mice were randomly divided into the four groups ( n=8–9) and fed an LF7 (low-fat diet with 7 mg PN /kg diet), LF1 (low-fat diet with 1 mg PN /kg diet), HF7 [high-fat (45% kcal from fat) diet with 7 mg PN /kg diet], or HF1 (high-fat diet with 1 mg PN/kg diet) diet.The experimental diets were provided ad libitum for 16 weeks.
The composition of the diets is shown in Supplementary Materials Table S1. The recommended amount of PN is a 7 mg /kg diet according to the AIN-93 formulation [ 21] and a 1 mg PN /kg diet has been reported as the minimum level to prevent a growth retardation [ 22].At the end of the experiments, the animals were fasted for 12 h and sacriﬁced after intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg /kg Zoletil (Virbac, Carros, France) and 10 mg /kg Rompun (Bayer Korea, Seoul, Korea).Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture.To obtain serum, blood was left at room temperature for 1 h and centrifuged at 3000 rpm, 4◦C for 20 min.The organs were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80◦C until analysis.All animal experiments were approved by Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources of Seoul National University (SNU-161111-1-2), and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Seoul National University.2.2.
Serum and Hepatic Biochemical Analysis Serum glucose, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) concentrations were analyzed using commercial colorimetric assay kits (Asan Pharmaceutical Co., Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After extraction of hepatic total lipids [ 23], cholesterol concentrations were determined using the same commercial kit.Hepatic TG and total bile acid concentrations were determined by thin-layer chromatography [ 24] and a total bile assay reagent kit (Gentaur, San Jose, CA, USA), respectively.Hepatic total homocysteine concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography, as previously described [25].2.3.Tissue Histologic Examination The dissected liver tissues were ﬁxed with formalin, embedded in para ﬃn, sectioned into 4µm-thick sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological analysis.
The morphology was examined under an Olympus BX50 microscope using a DP-72 digital camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and captured using the Image-Pro Plus program (Media Cybernetics Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). Nutrients 2020 ,12, 3821 3 of 10 2.4.Microarray Analysis Total hepatic RNA was extracted using RNAiso Plus (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) and RNA purity and integrity were conﬁrmed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).Transcriptome analysis was performed with A ﬀymetrix Mouse Clariom S arrays (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) as described previously [ 26].To identify di ﬀerentially expressed genes (DEGs) among groups, statistical signiﬁcance of the expression data was determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, p<0.05).DEGs between two groups were selected based on the cut-o ﬀcriteria ( |fold change |≥1.5 and p<0.05).
Functional analysis of DEGs was performed using the Gene Ontology (GO) database, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, and WikiPathways. False discovery rate was corrected by p-value using the Benjamini–Hochberg algorithm.Heatmaps and volcano plots were constructed using the PermutMatrix software and R package, respectively.2.5.Statistical Analysis Experimental results except for microarray data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 23; IBM SPSS Inc., Armonk, NY, USA).Data are expressed as the mean ±SEM and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Duncan’s multiple range test.Di ﬀerences with p<0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.3.Results 3.1.E ﬀects of Dietary Vitamin B6 Restriction on Serum and Hepatic Biochemical Parameters of Mice Consumption of a high-fat diet signiﬁcantly increased body weight in both vitamin B6-su ﬃcient and -deﬁcient groups (Figure 1a).
Relative weights of liver and epididymal fat were also signiﬁcantly increased by high-fat feeding (Figure 1b,c). Both body weight and relative organ weights were not signiﬁcantly changed by dietary vitamin B6 amount.High-fat feeding signiﬁcantly increased serum glucose concentrations, which were decreased by dietary vitamin B6 restriction (Figure 1d).Serum triglyceride concentrations were signiﬁcantly reduced by high-fat feeding, which tended to increase in mice fed a vitamin B6-restricted diet (Figure 1e).No signiﬁcant e ﬀect of dietary vitamin B6 restriction was observed in serum cholesterol, serum GPT, hepatic triglyceride, and hepatic cholesterol levels, which were signiﬁcantly higher in HF-fed mice compared to LF-fed mice (Figure 1f–i, Supplementary Materials Figure S1).Hepatic bile acid levels were not signiﬁcantly di ﬀerent between the groups (Figure 1j).
Previous studies have reported that mice with hepatic steatosis exhibited increased free fatty acid uptake and TG synthesis [ 27]. Furthermore, stimulation of lipoprotein lipase activity has been shown to be associated with reduced serum triglyceride concentrations in subjects with hepatic steatosis [28].3.2.E ﬀects of Dietary Vitamin B6 Restriction on Hepatic Transcriptome of Mice Global gene expression was analyzed to identify signatures in hepatic genes related to experimental diets.Based on microarray analysis, expressions of 4000 genes were signiﬁcantly altered and were largely dependent on fat content rather than vitamin B6 content in the diet (Figure 2a).Figure 2b,c show volcano plots of DEGs altered by vitamin B6 amount in mice fed a low-fat and high-fat diet, respectively.Among 108 DEGs in the LF1 /LF7 comparison and 44 DEGs in HF1 /HF7 comparison, Venn diagram shows only three overlapping DEGs, Asl,Nnmt , and Sds(Figure 2d).
All of these genes encode PLP-binding proteins that are involved in amino acid metabolism, including the urea cycle, amino acid methylation, and serine metabolism, respectively.

Serum triglyceride concentrations were significantly reduced by high-fat feeding, which tended to increase in mice fed a vitamin B6-restricted diet (Figure 1e). No significant effect of dietary vitamin B6 re striction was observed in serum cholesterol, serum GPT, hepatic triglyceride, and hepatic cholesterol levels, which were significantly higher in HF-fed mice compared to LF-fed mice (Figure 1f–i, Supplementary Materials Figure S1).Hepatic bile acid levels were not significantly different between the gr oups (Figure 1j).Previous studies have reported that mice with hepatic steatosis exhibited increa sed free fatty acid uptake and TG synthesis [27].Furthermore, stimulation of lipoprot ein lipase activity has been shown to be associated with reduced serum triglyceride concentrations in subjects with hepatic steatosis [28].3.2.
Effects of Dietary Vitamin B6 Restri ction on Hepatic Transcriptome of Mice Global gene expression was analyzed to identify signatures in hepatic genes related to experimental diets. Based on microarray analys is, expressions of 4000 genes were significantly altered and were largely dependent on fat content ra ther than vitamin B6 content in the diet (Figure 2a).Figure 2b,c show volcano plot s of DEGs altered by vitamin B6 amount in mice fed a low-fat and high-fat diet, respectively.Among 108 DEGs in the LF1/LF7 comparison and 44 DEGs in HF1/HF7 comparison, Venn diagram shows only three overlapping DEGs, Asl, Nnmt , and Sds (Figure 2d).All of these genes encode PLP-binding proteins that are involved in amino acid metabolism, including the urea cycle, amino acid methylation, and serine metabolism, respectively.Furthermore, we found the distinct effects of dietar y vitamin B6 restriction in mice fed either LF or HF.
According to the KEGG enrichment heatmap, “Jak-STAT signaling pathway” and “steroid biosynthesis”, were signif icantly associated with DEGs in the LF1/LF7 comparison (Figure 2e). On the other hand, KEGG pathways, such as “carbon metabo lism”, “biosynthesis of amino acids”, “alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism”, “cysteine and methionine metabolism”, and “phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis” were sign ificantly associated with DEGs in the HF1/HF7 comparison.Figure 2.Effects of dietary vitamin B6 restriction on hepatic ge ne expression profile.( a) A heatmap overview of the 2-way hierarchical clustering an alysis of differentially expressed gene (DEG) ( n = 3) Figure 2.Eﬀects of dietary vitamin B6 restriction on hepatic gene expression proﬁle.( a) A heatmap overview of the 2-way hierarchical clustering analysis of di ﬀerentially expressed gene (DEG) ( n=3) identiﬁed by one-way ANOVA ( p<0.05).

Discussion Many epidemiological studies indicate that obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease patients have poorer vitamin B6 status than he althy subjects, implicating the important role of vitamin B6 in the regulation of metabolism [1–3]. Furt hermore, high intake of vitamin B6 is associated with lower risks of various cancers [29].Here, we report that high-fat diet-induced obesity differentially regulates vitamin B6-mediated me tabolic pathways in the liver based on gene expression profiles of mice fed either a sufficient or restricted vitamin B6 diet.Although several studies have reported that changes in metabolites in marginal vitamin B6 deficiency model, few studies have performed gene expression profiling in this setting.To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to determine the hepatic gene expr ession profile in mice fed a vitamin B6-restricted diet.
In comparison of the hepatic gene expression profile between LF1 and LF7 groups, we observed upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and downregulation of genes involved in immune response. In previous studies, the effects of vitamin B6 deficiency on cholesterol accumulation were not consistent [30–33].Here, we observed that expression levels of several genes involved in cholesterol synthesis were significantly higher in the LF1 group compared to the LF7 group without concomitant changes in serum and hepa tic cholesterol concentrations, indicating that dietary vitamin B6 restriction may increase a conversion of cholesterol into bile acid.Accordingly, plasma concentrations of bile acids, including glycocholic acid, glycoursodeoxycholic acid, and murocholic acid, were increased in moderately vita min B6-deficient rats [17].
Although hepatic total bile acid levels tended to be higher in the LF1 group compared to the LF7 group, this trend did not reach statistical significance. Unlike previous studies using an absolute deficiency of vitamin B6 model [34,35], dietary vitamin B6 restri ction did not induce hepatic steatosis.As shown in the present study in mice fed a lo w-fat diet, vitamin B6 deficiency is shown to reduce antibody production and to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, leading to impaired immune responses [5,6,36].Conversely, there were no si gnificantly enriched GO terms associated with immunity between HF1 and HF7.Because the immune response is highly associated with high-fat feeding, consumption of a high-fat diet may mask the suppressive effect of vitamin B6 on immune response.Indeed, DEGs in the HF7/LF7 comparison were significantly enriched in GO terms, including “immune system process”, “immune response”, and “inflammatory response”.
Consumption of a low vitamin B6 diet altered plasma concentrations of amino acids and their metabolites in human studies [20]. We observed that several amino acid metabolic pathways were significantly regulated by dietary vitamin B6 restriction, especially in mice fed a high-fat diet.Figure 5.Eﬀects of high-fat diet on hepatic vitamin B6 metabolism and function.( a) Hepatic mRNA levels of Aox1 andAox3 were analyzed by microarray.Data are expressed as means ±SEMs ( n=3).Means with the same letter are not signiﬁcantly di ﬀerent from each other (one-way ANOVA, p<0.05).(b) Heatmap of di ﬀerentially expressed genes enriched in gene ontology term “pyridoxal phosphate binding”.LF7, a low-fat diet with 7 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride (PN) /kg diet; LF1, a low-fat diet with 1 mg PN /kg diet; HF7, a high-fat diet with 7 mg PN /kg diet; HF1, a high-fat diet with 1 mg PN /kg diet.
In addition, we observed the overall down-regulation of PLP-dependent enzyme-encoding genes in response to high-fat consumption (Figure 5b). Among 11 DEGs enriched in the GO term “pyridoxal phosphate binding”, expression of Sptlc2 andSptlc3 genes involved in lipid metabolism were upregulated and the remaining nine DEGs were downregulated in the high-fat groups compared to the low-fat groups, implicating the overall downregulation of pathways involving PLP as a cofactor in response to a high fat consumption.4.Discussion Many epidemiological studies indicate that obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease patients have poorer vitamin B6 status than healthy subjects, implicating the important role of vitamin B6 in the regulation of metabolism [ 1–3].Furthermore, high intake of vitamin B6 is associated with lower risks of various cancers [ 29].
Here, we report that high-fat diet-induced obesity di ﬀerentially regulates vitamin B6-mediated metabolic pathways in the liver based on gene expression proﬁles of mice fed either a su ﬃcient or restricted vitamin B6 diet. Although several studies have reported that changes in metabolites in marginal vitamin B6 deﬁciency model, few studies have performed gene expression proﬁling in this setting.To the best of our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to determine the hepatic gene expression proﬁle in mice fed a vitamin B6-restricted diet.In comparison of the hepatic gene expression proﬁle between LF1 and LF7 groups, we observed upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and downregulation of genes involved in immune response.In previous studies, the e ﬀects of vitamin B6 deﬁciency on cholesterol accumulation were not consistent [ 30–33].
Here, we observed that expression levels of several genes involved in cholesterol synthesis were signiﬁcantly higher in the LF1 group compared to the LF7 group without concomitant changes in serum and hepatic cholesterol concentrations, indicating that dietary vitamin B6 restriction may increase a conversion of cholesterol into bile acid. Accordingly, plasma concentrations of bile acids, including glycocholic acid, glycoursodeoxycholic acid, and murocholic acid, were increased in moderately vitamin B6-deﬁcient rats [ 17].Although hepatic total bile acid levels tended to be higher in the LF1 group compared to the LF7 group, this trend did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.Unlike previous studies using an absolute deﬁciency of vitamin B6 model [34,35], dietary vitamin B6 restriction did not induce hepatic steatosis.
As shown in the present study in mice fed a low-fat diet, vitamin B6 deﬁciency is shown to reduce antibody production and to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, leading to impaired immune responses [ 5,6,36]. Conversely, there were no signiﬁcantly enriched GO terms associated with immunity Nutrients 2020 ,12, 3821 8 of 10 between HF1 and HF7.Because the immune response is highly associated with high-fat feeding, consumption of a high-fat diet may mask the suppressive e ﬀect of vitamin B6 on immune response.Indeed, DEGs in the HF7 /LF7 comparison were signiﬁcantly enriched in GO terms, including “immune system process”, “immune response”, and “inﬂammatory response”.Consumption of a low vitamin B6 diet altered plasma concentrations of amino acids and their metabolites in human studies [ 20].We observed that several amino acid metabolic pathways were signiﬁcantly regulated by dietary vitamin B6 restriction, especially in mice fed a high-fat diet.
Particularly, sulfur amino acid metabolism was signiﬁcantly altered by vitamin B6 insu ﬃciency in mice fed a high-fat diet. In previous studies, concentrations of cystathionine, a major metabolite in the transsulfuration pathway, were increased in humans and animals with mild and complete vitamin B6 deﬁciencies [ 19,20,37].Interestingly, we observed that consumption of high-fat diet exhibited more apparent regulatory e ﬀects on expression of amino acid metabolizing enzymes requiring PLP than consumption of a vitamin-B6-restricted diet.Although we did not measure concentrations of amino acids or amino acid metabolites, these results indicate that vitamin B6 deﬁciency could play important roles in the regulation of amino acid metabolism in subjects with metabolic syndrome.There are several possible ways by which vitamin B6 levels regulate gene expression in the present study.
First, vitamin B6 has been shown to regulate the functions of steroid hormones, including glucocorticoids, androgen, progesterone, and estrogen by modulating steroid hormone-mediated gene expressions [ 38]. Second, vitamin B6 level regulates homocysteine levels, resulting in alterations in the cellular SAM:SAH ratio and DNA methyltransferase activity.Accordingly, we observed that hepatic homocysteine concentrations were signiﬁcantly increased by vitamin B6 deﬁciency.A previous study reported that PLP deﬁciency resulted in chromosome breaks and rearrangements in Drosophila, which were increased in the presence of sucrose and its precursors [39].5.Conclusions Although e ﬀects of dietary vitamin B6 absence on regulation of amino acid metabolism have been actively conducted, the involved molecular mechanisms of vitamin B6 are not clearly known.
In the present study, we observed functional e ﬀects of dietary vitamin B6 restriction on cholesterol metabolism and immune response in mice fed a low-fat diet. On the other hand, functional e ﬀects of dietary vitamin B6 restriction on amino acid metabolism were observed in mice fed a high-fat diet by hepatic gene expression proﬁle analysis.These results provide evidence of the distinct role of a high-fat diet in alteration of PLP-associated pathways in the liver of mice in response to dietary vitamin B6 restriction.Because PLP is a cofactor of various enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, further research is warranted to explore the e ﬀects of vitamin B6 insu ﬃciency on brain function.
