To overcome these limitations, we developed an optimized work ﬂow for imaging and quantitative analysis of axons in and around the bone, including validation of Baf53b-Cr e in concert with R26R-tdTomato (Ai9) as a robust pan-neuronal reporter system for use in musculoskeletal tissues. In addition , we created comprehensive maps o f sympathetic adrenergic and sensory peptidergic axons within and around the full length of t he femur and tibia in two strains of mice (B6 and C3H).In the peri- osteum, these maps were related to the surrounding musculatur e, including entheses and myotendinous attachments to bone.Three distinct patterns of periosteal innervation (termed type I, II, III) were de ﬁned at sites that are important for bone pain, bone repair, and skeletal homeostasis.For the ﬁrst time, our results establish a gradient of bone marrow axon density that increases from proximal to distal along the length of the tibia and de ﬁne key regions of interest for neuroskeletal studies.
Lastly, this information was related to major nerve branches and local maps of specialize d mechanoreceptors. This detailed mapping and contextualiza- tion of the axonal subtypes innervating the skeleton is intended to serve as a guide during the design, implementation, and inter- pretation of future neuroskeletal studies and was compiled as a resource for the ﬁeld as part of the NIH SPARC consortium.© 2021 The Authors.Journal of Bone and Mineral Research published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).
KEY WORDS: BONE-BRAIN-NERVOUS SYSTEM INTERACTIONS; BONE-FAT INTERACTIONS; BONE-MUSCLE INTERACTIONS Introduction Peripheral nerves target nearly every organ in the body to communicate afferent and efferent signals to and from the brain; the skeleton is no exception.(1)Neurons in and around the bone have well-established roles in the generation and mainte-nance of pain associated with skeletal pathologies, including frac-ture, tumor progression, and arthritis.
(2–4)Within cortical bone and bone marrow, sensory and sympathetic nerve ﬁbers track with the arteriolar vasculature(5–7)and coordinate vasoregulatory responses.(8–11)Additional functions of skeletal axons have also been proposed, including modulation of bone formation andturnover in the context of skeletal development, (12)adaptationto mechanical loading,(13,14)repair, and regeneration,(15–17)as well as regulation of bone marrow adipocyte metabolism,(18)joint disease,(19)and control of hematopoietic cell maturation and egress.(20) Direct neural modulation of skeletal function is dependent upon the precise localization of axons near target cells and thecapacity of the neurons to sense the bone microenvironmentand/or to release neurotransmitters.
The most well-characterizedskeletal nerve ﬁbers are sensory peptidergic axons, the majority of which are marked by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and sympathetic adrenergic axons containing tyrosine hydroxy-lase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. (6) These neuronal subtypes have been shown to innervate the This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and repro duction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes.Received in original form September 30, 2020; revised form February 5, 2021; accepted February 11, 2021.Accepted manuscript online February 16, 202 1.Address correspondence to: Erica L Scheller, DDS, PhD, Washington University, 660 South Euclid Avenue, Campus Box 8301, St.Louis, MO 63110, USA.

(21,22)Although the morphology and molecular phenotype of skeletal axons havebeen well studied, (23)the inherent challenges of visualizing and quantifying neural ﬁbers in calci ﬁed tissue have led to a functional and anatomical neuroskeletal map that is incom- plete. This is complicated by the heterogeneity of the bonearchitecture, the complex tissu e interactions therein, and the opposing in ﬂuences of the sensory and sympathetic arms of the nervous system that converge to in ﬂuence the physiologi- cal functions of the skeleton.(1) To begin to overcome this, we used thick-section immunohis- tochemistry and tissue clearing, in concert with high-resolutionimaging and axon quanti ﬁcation techniques, to comprehen- sively map skeletal axons within and around the femur and tibia.In addition, we used the Baf53b-Cre –R26R-tdTomato (Ai9) reporter system to corroborate the neural speci ﬁcity of our immunolabeling and further identify a Baf53b+ axon subpopula-tion innervating the skeleton.
Lastly, we de ﬁned the location, prevalence, and morphology of specialized mechanoreceptorendings. This information has been compiled into a referenceatlas of skeletal innervation that can be used to inform futureneuroskeletal studies.This resource was generated as part ofthe SPARC consortium (Stimulating Peripheral Activity to RelieveConditions), a call by the National Institutes of Health in theUnited States to generate foundational neuroanatomic maps ofaxons within peripheral tissues with the aim of supporting thedevelopment of novel neuroceuticals for targeted treatment ofpain and other conditions.Materials and Methods Key reagents and resources used in this study are detailed inSupplemental Table S1.Mice All work was performed as approved by the animal use and carecommittee at Washington University (St.Louis, MO, USA).Micewere housed on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum (PicoLab 5053, LabDiet, St.Louis, MO, USA).
C57BL6J (JAX Strain#000664), C3H/HeJ (JAX Strain #000659), Baf53b-Cre (JAX Strain#027826), and Ai9 reporter mice (JAX Strain #007909) wereobtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).Schwann cell reporter mice were a kind gift of Dr Jeffrey Mil- brandt and were generated by crossing the following strains: P 0-Cre (JAX Strain 017927)(24)and Ai9- ﬂox/ﬂox (JAX Strain 007909).(25) Histology and immunostaining Tissue isolation and embedding Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and perfused through the left ventricle of the heart with 10 mL phosphatebuffered saline followed by 10 mL 10% neutral buffered formalin(NBF; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA; 23 –245684). For all experiments, collected tissues were post- ﬁxed in 10%NBF for 24-hours.After ﬁxation, tissues were washed for 2 hours in diH 2O.Bones were fully decalci ﬁed in 14% EDTA (Sigma- Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA; E5134), pH 7.4 and equilibrated in30% sucrose solution before embedding in OCT mountingmedia (Fisher HealthCare 23 –730-571, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc). Antibody optimization and storage CGRP, TH, and NF200 antibody dilutions were optimized using mixed neural and skeletal tissue (frozen sections through the spi-nal column containing vertebral bone, spinal cord, and dorsalroot ganglion).Antibody dilutions were selected based on posi-tive staining of target neural cells and axons with minimal back-ground staining in surrounding tissues.Antibody use andstorage are detailed in Supplemental Table S2.Frozen immunostaining and imaging Embedded tissues were cut at 50 μm on a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA).For immunostaining, cut sections on ColorfrostPlus glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc 12-550-18) were blocked in 10% donkey serum in TNT buffer before incubationfor 48 hours with primary antibodies at 4 /C14C (Supplemental Table S2).
After washing 3 ×5 minutes, secondary antibodies in TNT buffer were applied for 24 hours at 4/C14C (Supplemental Table S2). The sections were then washed 3 ×5 minutes in TNT buffer, incubated in DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 minutes, andwashed again before mounting with Fluoromount-G (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc 00-4958-02).For Figs.1 –3, 5, and Supplemental Files A –D, serial tiled images were taken with a 10 ×objective on a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) spinning disk confocal microscope(μm/px = 0.650, step size = 2.5 μm, number of steps = 21).Stitch- ing of the nd2 multipoint ﬁles was done using the FIJI Stitching plugin “snake by rows.”For Fig.5, serial tile images were obtained using a Leica confocal at 10 ×(μm/px = 0.6968, step size = 2.5 μm, number of steps = 41) with automatic stitching through the LASX Software.Step-by-step tissue preparationand immunostaining instructions are also available at proto-cols.io (DOI: dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bqu2mwye).
Confocal image segmentation and anaylsis Selection of quanti ﬁcation regions From the longitudinal array of slides created for each bone, four sections were chosen corresponding to the metaphysis, mid-diaphysis with tibial ridge, diaphysis proximal to the TFJ, anddiaphysis just distal to the TFJ. For each of the above regions, sec-tions were chosen based on morphological similarity, includingbone shape and attachment sites.Generation of tissue masks A combined cancellous and cortical bone mask was generated simultaneously by thresholding max projections of the FITC chan-nel (green) in FIJI.(26)Optimal upper and lower thresholds were chosen to remove muscle, connective tissue, marrow, and otherbackground cellularity (some speckle and small holes in bonewere allowed at this stage).After thresholding, bone masks weremanually corrected based on the source ﬁle in ImageJ by clearing non-bone elements using the freehand selection tool.
A medianﬁlter (radius = 11) was applied to smooth the mask. Medullary masks were generated by inverting the bone mask in FIJI, drawinga circle inside the cortical ring using the freehand selection tool,and clearing outside the selection.Cancellous and cortical bone Journal of Bone and Mineral Research NEUROSKELETAL ATLAS OF MOUSE HINDLIMB 1013n Fig 1.Neuroskeletal axon density varies by bone compartment, tibial level, and mouse strain.( A) 3D rendering of a μCT scan of a 12-week-old male B6 tibia, lateral view.L 1to L 4represent levels analyzed as distinguished by cross-sectional bone morphology.Percentages demarcate approximate distance from the knee as a percentage of total tibia length.Scale bar = 1 mm.( B)L1left: representative confocal micrograph through a 50- μm-thick transverse cross section with immunolabeled CGRP+ sensory axons (magenta) and TH+ sympathetic axons (green), as well as DAPI+ nuclei (blue).

A median ﬁlter (radius = 6) was applied tosmooth the mask, and lastly holes in the periosteum were ﬁlled using the FIJI binary operation Fill Holes to create a continuous layer.In cases where the periosteum made a complete ring, a small pathwas cleared from the periosteum before performing the binaryoperation and was subsequently repaired. Cortical and cancellous BV/TV calculation The area of the cortical bone, cancellous bone, and marrow cav- ity were calculated in FIJI from the masks created bythresholding-based segmentation described above.CorticalBV/TV was calculated as cortical bone area/(cortical bone area+ marrow area), and cancellous BV/TV was calculated as cancel-lous bone area/marrow area.Fig 2.Peripheral axons innervate the periosteum in three distinct patterns (type I, II, III).( A–D) Type I: aneural patterns are found at entheses, sites where tendons or ligaments attach to the cortical bone (CB) surface.

( E–H) Type II: anchored/diving innervation patterns are found at sites where axons transit directly from the associated muscle (M) tissue through theﬁbrous and cambium layers of the periosteum at a 90-degree angle to the cortical bone surface as visualized here in the C3H tibia where the popliteus muscle attaches to the bone. ( I–L) Type III: fascial/parallel innervation patterns are found at sites where fascia attach to bone.Axons are woven through the thin periosteal layer at these sites and run parallel to the bone surface as evident in cross section ( I,K,L).The mesh-like network of periosteal axons at these sites is clearly visualized by periosteal whole-mount preparation ( J; see Martin et al.(7)and Thai et al.(40)).Scale bars = 100 μm.
Journal of Bone and Mineral Research NEUROSKELETAL ATLAS OF MOUSE HINDLIMB 1015n Axon tracing and quanti ﬁcation TH+, CGRP+, and Baf53b-tdTomato+ axons were independently traced with the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin(27)to obtain total axon length. The volume of the periosteum and marrow cavitywere calculated as the area multiplied by a section thickness of50μm.Volumetric density of ﬁber lengths was calculated as the total length of ﬁbers traced divided by the corresponding volume for the region traced.Identi ﬁcation of nerves within the bone marrow is more challenging than at other sites becauseof non-speci ﬁc auto ﬂuorescence, poor light penetration, and the presence of antibody-dependent cellular staining.This can result Fig 3.Baf53b-tdTomato is a robust, selective reporter system for skeletal innervation.

After this, bone and nerve masks were imported into Adobe Photo-shop and overlaid on a grayscale max projection of the FITCand DAPI channels from the original image. This results in a visu-ally accurate map of axon length, branching, orientation, and rel- ative density.However, features such as absolute nerve diameter are not preserved.Micro-CT and maps Representative two- and three-dimensional maps of the type I, II,and III periosteal innervation patterns were generated after com-prehensive review of serial images generated every 150 μm Fig 4.Relationships between peripheral nerves and periosteal axon patterns and the musculoskeletal system.( A,B) Schematic of major nerve branches in the anterior and posterior thigh ( A) and leg ( B) overlaid on 3D-rendered- μCT scans of the left femur and tibia –ﬁbula, respectively.Scale bars = 1 mm.

Journal of Bone and Mineral Research n1018 LORENZ ET AL.Whole-mount tissue clearing and imaging Tissue clearing was performed as previously described with minor modi ﬁcation.(29)Brieﬂy, mice were intracardially perfused with 20 mL 0.02 M PBS followed by 20 mL of fresh 4% parafor-maldehyde.Immediately after perfusion, dissected tissues werepost- ﬁxed in 4% PFA at 4 /C14C overnight.The post- ﬁxed limb was then incubated in A4P0 hydrogel overnight (5 mL 40% acrylam-ide, 45 mL of PBS, and 0.125 g of VA044) and polymerized at38 /C14C for 6 hours.The forelimb was then incubated in 8% SDS at 37/C14C for 5 days to fully clear muscle and bone tissue.After 2 days of thorough PBS washing, the forelimb was incubated in25% quadrol at 37 /C14C for 2 days.After another 2 days of thorough washing in PBS, the bones were incubated in 1.42 and 1.48 RIMSof Histodenz for 1 day each before imaging.
Images were takenwith 4 ×objective on the SmartSPIM imaging system through the full length of the bone and 3D reconstructed with ORS(Montreal, Canada) Dragon ﬂy Software for visualization of the P 0+ Schwann cells. Statistics Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad (La Jolla, CA,USA) Prism.Speci ﬁc tests are indicated in the ﬁgure legends.A pvalue <.05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant.Results Validation of neuroskeletal immunoassay and axon quanti ﬁcation in the C3H and B6 mouse tibia Before creating the atlas, we validated our axon tracing and immunostaining paradigm relative to previous publications(Table 1).(6,30,31)To achieve this, we quanti ﬁed CGRP+ peptider- gic sensory and TH+ adrenergic sympathetic axons in the perios-teum and bone marrow of 12-week-old male C57BL/6J(B6) and C3H/HeJ mice (C3H) at four levels along the length ofthe tibia.
Region-speci ﬁc bone parameters including cortical and trabecular bone volume fraction (BVF) were also assessed.Levels of the tibia selected for analysis were distinguished bybone morphology at the metaphysis, mid-diaphysis with tibialridge, the diaphysis proximal to the tibia- ﬁbula junction (TFJ), and the diaphysis just distal to the TFJ. Analyzed levels approxi-mated to 10% (L 1), 30% (L 2), 50% (L 3), and 60% (L 4) distal to the knee for B6 mice (Fig.1 A,B).Consistent with previous reports,(32,33)the diaphyseal cortical BVF was signi ﬁcantly higher in C3H than B6 mice (L 2,L3; Fig.1 C).However, cortical BVF was matched in the two strains at both the proximal and distal meta-physis (L 1,L4; Fig.1 C).Trabecular BVF was comparable in both strains at the proximal metaphysis (L 1; Fig.1 G), also consistent with prior comparisons at this region and age.(34)Trabecular bone was largely absent in the tibial diaphysis of both B6 andC3H mice (L 2to L 4).
At each level, CGRP+ sensory and TH+ sympathetic axons were traced, and the total ﬁber length within each compartment was expressed relative to the total compartment volume(Fig. 1 B).As reported previously for femur (Table 1), the perios- teum was the most densely innervated compartment of the tibiafor both B6 and C3H mice.Within the periosteum, we found thatCGRP+ sensory axons demonstrated level-speci ﬁc densities that were dependent on mouse strain (Fig.1 D).By contrast, TH+ sym- pathetic axon density was relatively constant along the length ofthe periosteum.C3H mice had a greater absolute TH+ ﬁber den- sity at all levels relative to B6 (Fig.1 E).Independent of strain,periosteal CGRP+ sensory ﬁbers were more prevalent than TH+ sympathetics at all levels of the tibia (periosteal CGRP:THratio > 1; Fig.1 F).This ratio was higher in B6 animals than C3H (Fig.1 F).Within the marrow cavity, innervation density increased from proximal to distal independent of strain (Fig.1 H,I).
Con- verse to the ratio of neural subtypes observed in the periosteum,TH+ sympathetic innervation consistently exceeded CGRP+ sen-sory innervation in all regions of the bone marrow (CGRP:THratio < 1; Fig. 1 J).Overall, our immunolabeling and analysis par- adigm corroborates previous reports of compartmentalizedinnervation density (Table 1), and additionally demonstrates thatthis varies by strain.Our results further establish a gradient ofbone marrow axon density that increases from proximal to distalalong the length of the tibia.
Identi ﬁcation of three distinct patterns of periosteal innervation (type I, II, III) Next, we applied this validated CGRP and TH immunolabeling and tracing paradigm to assess the periosteal axon pro ﬁles throughout the entire length and circumference of the tibiaand femur of male and female 12-week-old C3H and B6 mice.The periosteum is the layer of connective tissue that envelopsthe bone and provides a supportive microenvironment for vas-culature, nerves, and periosteal cells. (35,36)We identi ﬁed three consistent patterns of adult periosteal innervation that alignedwith both the attachments formed between the periosteumand the surrounding tissues and the orientation of the nerveaxons, independent of mouse sex or strain.Within each innerva-tion pattern, we observed variations in local axon density andorientation that should be considered for future studies pertain-ing to the relationships between nerves and bone, as describedbelow.
Type I: aneural Many regions of the bone surface were aneural, completely lack- ing CGRP+ sensory or TH+ sympathetic innervation (Fig. 2 A–D).Aneural regions were observed primarily where tendons or liga-ments interfaced with the bone at sites called entheses.Thereare two main classes of entheses: ﬁbrocartilaginous and ﬁbrous.(37,38)Fibrocartilaginous entheses comprise continuous zones connecting tendinous ﬁbers through unmineralized and mineralized ﬁbrocartilage tissue that blend imperceptibly into bone (Fig.2 A).Atﬁbrous entheses, the tendon is continuous with a thick ﬁbrous layer of the periosteum (Fig.2 B).The only axons found in these regions were located in the fascial tissue liningthe tendon or ligament, often referred to as the epitenon.TypeI regions greatly contributed to the discontinuous nature of peri-osteal innervation.
Type II: anchored/diving In other regions, axons transited directly from the associated muscle tissue through the ﬁbrous and cambium layers of the periosteum at a 90-degree angle to the cortical bone surface(Fig. 2 E–H).Type II regions contained TH+ sympathetic axons and an abundance of CGRP+ sensory axons that appeared todive from the sarcolemma or muscle fascia to the bone surface.Regions with a diving innervation pattern aligned most closelywith sites where muscle is connected to periosteal bone by par-tially mineralized ﬁber anchors, known also as extrinsic ﬁbers or Sharpey ’sﬁbers.(39) Journal of Bone and Mineral Research NEUROSKELETAL ATLAS OF MOUSE HINDLIMB 1019n Type III: fascial/parallel The most prevalent pattern of innervation observed consisted of a meshwork of CGRP+ sensory and TH+ sympathetic axonswithin the periosteum where fascia attached to the bone(Fig.2 I–L).
At these sites, the periosteal layer is relatively thin and the axons run close to the bone, parallel to the cortical sur- face. This type III meshwork pattern is apparent in periosteal whole-mount preparations taken from regions of the bonewhere the absence of tendinous or extrinsic ﬁbers allows for sep- aration of the periosteum from adjacent tissues (Fig.2 J).(7,30,40) Application of the selective, pan-neuronal reporter system Baf53b-tdTomato in the skeleton The Baf53b-Cre transgenic mouse line was previously reported to exhibit Cre expression in neurons of the central and peripheralnervous system but not in progenitors, glia, and most non-neuralcells.(41)In this study, we crossed Baf53b-Cre mice with reporter mice containing a ﬂoxed R26R-tdTomato (Ai9) allele(25)to exam- ine the utility of this reporter system for quanti ﬁcation and visu- alization of nerves in and around the bone (referred to here asBaf53b-tdTomato).
Transverse sections of the tibia were co-stained with TH and CGRP to further validate the sensitivityand speci ﬁcity of our immunostaining protocol. We found robust, neural-speci ﬁc expression of Baf53b-tdTomato through- out the musculoskeletal system (Fig.3 A–C).Leveraging our imag- ing and axon tracing paradigm in these tibial sections furthercorroborated the neural origin and speci ﬁcity of our TH and CGRP immunolabeling, as TH+ or CGRP+ axons localized withthe axonal Baf53b-tdTomato signal (Fig.3 A–C).The density of each of these peripheral axon subpopulations was quanti ﬁed as a percent of the total axons within the periosteum and bonemarrow.We identi ﬁed nerve ﬁbers in both bone compartments that were positive only for Baf53b-tdTomato (mean ± SD;44.2% ± 14.8 in the periosteum and 25.1% ± 18.0 in the bonemarrow; Fig.3 D), revealing a signi ﬁcant proportion of skeletal axons that do not express CGRP or TH.
This Baf53b-tdTomato-only population appears to include entire axons originating fromdistinct neural subpopulations and intermittent segments ofCGRP+ and TH+ axons that do not contain immunostained neu-rotransmitter or enzyme. Lastly, we evaluated the Baf53b + axonphenotype and orientation within the type I, II, and III periostealregions (Fig.2).This revealed that differential axon pro ﬁles were maintained in type II and type III regions and further con ﬁrmed that regions of the bone surface identi ﬁed as type I were aneural (Fig.3 E).Generation of 2D and 3D maps of type I –III periosteal innervation patterns in relation to overlying nerves and muscles Nerve supply of the limb Axons innervating the femur are primarily derived from the fem- oral nerve (Fig.4 A).The femoral nerve runs along the anterome- dial aspect of the femur and provides innervation to the musclegroups that function as knee extensors (rectus femoris and vas-tus muscles).
(42,43)It also provides the innervation to the anterior and medial aspects of the femur bone.(44,45)The obturator nerve runs nearby, also anteromedial to the femur, and innervates thehip adductors (gracilis anterior, gracilis posterior, adductorlongus, adductor magnus) and some hip rotators in the glutealregion (quadratus femoris, obturator externus). There is no cur-rent evidence that the obturator nerve innervates the femurbone.The sciatic nerve runs along the posterior aspect of thefemur and innervates the posterior femoral muscles that func-tion as hip extensors (semitendinosus, semimembranosus, cau- dofemoralis, biceps femoris).(42,43)A segment of the posterior femur bone is also innervated by the sciatic nerve.(46) Slightly above the posterior aspect of the knee, the sciatic nerve branches into the tibial and common peroneal nerves.Innervation of the tibia bone is primarily derived from the sciaticnerve (Fig.
4 B) with evidence in humans for minor sensory contri- butions by the terminal branches of the femoral nerve in themedial regions of the proximal tibial epiphysis/metaphysis anddistal epiphysis. (44,46)The tibial branch of the sciatic nerve runs down the leg on the posterior side of the tibia with the peronealartery and veins and innervates the knee ﬂexors, ankle plantar ﬂexors, hip extensors, and hip motion groups in addition to the tibia bone.(42,43)By contrast, the common peroneal nerve wraps around the ﬁbula to the front of the tibia.It sends a branch termed the recurrent articular nerve to the region of the proxi-mal epiphysis and joint.Distally, it splits into the super ﬁcial pero- neal nerve and the deep peroneal nerve.The deep peronealnerve runs between the tibia and ﬁbula along the interosseousTable 1.

membrane and, in addition to innervating the tibia bone, it sends smaller branches that innervate muscles of the ankle ever-ter and dorsi ﬂexor families, including the tibialis anterior. (42,43) Two-dimensional muscle maps with type I –III innervation patterns The periosteum is a fascial connective tissue that is continuous with other layers of limb fascia including the epitenon and epi-mysium.To facilitate the consideration of periosteal axon pat-terns within the context of these boundaries, we createdrepresentative schematics showing muscle attachments andmuscle labeling (Fig.4 C,D).These were adapted from Charles and colleagues (28)with muscle placement and innervation pat- terns adjusted based on our serial immunostaining analysis.Type I, II, and III innervation patterns were illustrated on thebone-tissue interface in the cross-sectional schematics andcolor-coded in relation to surrounding muscle attachments.
Thisprocess was repeated along the length of the femur and tibia, aspresented in the atlas compilation (Supplemental Files A –D) and overview section in Fig. 4.Three-dimensional type I –III innervation pattern maps In addition to the 2D maps, the localization of each periosteal innervation pattern was mapped onto the surface of the femurand tibia and color-coded to match surrounding muscle groups(Fig.4 E,F).Type I aneural regions were localized to the epiphyses and metaphyses of the tibia and femur.Type II anchored/divingregions were primarily localized in the metaphyses and alongthe diaphyses of the long bones.There were noted differencesin the prevalence of type II regions between B6 and C3H bones;these can be explored in more detail in the atlases (Supplemen-tal Files A –D).Type III fascial/parallel innervation was prominent on bone surfaces interfaced with loosely adherent fascia, such aswith extra-skeletal adipose tissue, epitenon, and unanchoredareas of the epimysium.
A type III pattern was also found onthe intraosseous fascial membranes between connected longbones, such as the tibia and ﬁbula. Mapping of specialized mechanoreceptor endings The skeleton is primarily innervated by neurons with small, ﬁnely myelinated and/or unmyelinated axons.(23)However, in speci ﬁc regions, large-diameter axons with specialized mechanoreceptorendings known as Pacinian corpuscles have also been identi ﬁed in association with the interosseous membranes and the perios- teum of large mammals.(47,48)This has not been clearly demon- strated or mapped in the mouse.To overcome this, wegenerated reporter mice with a ﬂoxed R26R-tdTomato (Ai9) allele expressing Cre recombinase under control of the myelin protein zero (P 0) gene promoter to label mature myelinating Schwann cells and their precursors (referred to as P 0-tdTo- mato).(24)Schwann cells are the main glial cells of the peripheral nervous system.
In addition to labeling myelinated axons, wefound that the P 0-tdTomato reporter system labels the lamellar Schwann cell layers that make up the outer structure of the Paci-nian corpuscle. Whole-bone tissue clearing and light-sheetmicroscopy of the forearm of the P 0-tdTomato reporter mouse revealed major nerve branches and the distribution of Paciniancorpuscles along the lateral aspect of the ulna 50% to 70% distalto the elbow (Fig.5 A–C).In cross sections, Pacinian corpuscles could be identi ﬁed morphologically as a single myelinated sen- sory ﬁber (NF200+) in the center of a lamellar capsule that was closely approximated to, though not continuous with, theperiosteum (Fig.5 D–F).Central axons were also positive for Baf53b and negative for CGRP and TH (Fig.5 G,H).Serial cross- section examination of Pacinian corpuscles in the limb localizedthese specialized mechanoreceptors exclusively to the mid-diaphyseal and distal regions of the tibia (Fig.
5 G–I) as mapped in the atlases (Supplemental Files C, D). Limb atlases —overview and contents These observations and outcomes were compiled into four inter- active atlases that cover the prevalence, localization, and mor-phology of the CGRP+ sensory and TH+ sympathetic nerveﬁbers in and around the femur (Supplemental Files A, B) and tibia (Supplemental Files C, D), in addition to their relationship withthe overlying musculature, fascial tissue, and perilipin-positivebone marrow and extraskeletal adipocytes.Unique cross sec-tions were selected from serial analysis, annotated by relativedistance to the knee joint.The longitudinal range of the bonethat comprises similar bone morphology, as well as continuousperiosteal innervation patterns and common tissue interfaces isindicated on each page to facilitate sectioning of regions of inter-est.Additional features and proposed use of these atlases aredetailed in Fig.6.Discussion The innervation of the skeleton is not uniform.
In this article, wedemonstrate that peripheral axon subtype-speci ﬁc densities and morphology vary by bone compartment and site and are in ﬂu- enced by mouse genetic strain. This dynamic, region-speci ﬁc innervation of the bone and bone marrow likely in ﬂuences pain and cellular function in states of skeletal homeostasis and in tar-geted areas of bone injury and in ﬂammation.The maps provided here are intended to serve as a baseline reference and guide dur-ing the design and selection of regions of interest for future neu-roskeletal studies in the femur, tibia, and beyond.For example,though not mapped in detail, our light-sheet imaging suggeststhat the nerve patterns and localization of specialized mechano-receptors within the forelimb, another common site used forskeletal research, mimic those detailed in the tibia.
In addition,the tissue preparation, immunostaining, imaging, and nervequanti ﬁcation methods reported here may be easily applied in any control or transgenic mouse model of targeted injury, phar-macologic intervention, or systemic disease. Previous mapping studies in the femur (Table 1) demonstrate that the periosteum is the most densely innervated compart- ment, where CGRP+ peptidergic sensory axons predominate,whereas TH+ sympathetic axons are more prevalent in the mar-row cavity.For the ﬁrst time, we corroborate these ﬁndings in the tibia, and additionally identify a strain-independent proximal-to-distal increase in bone marrow axon density.We anticipate thatthese ﬁndings re ﬂect a primarily arterial localization of sympa- thetic axons; a vast intra-marrow sinusoidal network runs thelength of the tibia, with a proximal-to-distal increase in arterialdensity.
(49)We also report that the periosteum and marrow of B6 mice are overall less densely innervated by sympathetic axonscompared with C3H mice. Although the functional signi ﬁcance of these observations remains to be clari ﬁed, the localized den- sity of speci ﬁc axonal subtypes has distinct functional implica- tions.Neural contributions to adaptive loading, as well asfracture pain and healing, have been largely ascribed to localsensory ﬁbers in the periosteum.(17,50,51)Neural contributions to hematopoiesis and skeletal metastasis have been attributed Journal of Bone and Mineral Research NEUROSKELETAL ATLAS OF MOUSE HINDLIMB 1021n Fig 6.Mouse limb atlases —guide for use.( A) The four supplemental atlases comprise systematic analyses of serial, transverse cross sections down the length of the femur and tibia in B6 and C3H mice, where each page details a section of the bone at a particular percent distance from the knee.
Thisincludes ( B) representative confocal projections of immunohistochemically labeled CGRP+ sensory and TH+ sympathetic nerve ﬁbers, along with perili- pin+ adipocytes and DAPI-stained nuclei, in and around the bone and ( C) corresponding bone-masked, axon-traced overlays to highlight and visualize the neuroskeletal features. ( D) In addition, the atlas contains 2D reference maps with pattern-coded periosteal innervation patterns superimposed on the bone interface and related to color-coded muscle groups and individual muscle identities.( E) Lastly, these 2D maps served as the basis for 3D mapping of periosteal innervation patterns and color-coded muscle groups onto the lateral, posterior, medial, and anterior aspects of the corresponding bo ne.(F) Instructions for accessing interactive features are located at the bottom of the page, such as displaying innervation pattern legend, muscle group c olor legend, and full muscle identi ﬁers, or toggling through confocal channels.
Journal of Bone and Mineral Research n1022 LORENZ ET AL. to sympathetic activity,(52,53)in line with the intimate association of sympathetic ﬁbers with the arteriolar vasculature and their rel- ative abundance in the marrow.Both arms of the peripheral ner-vous system have been implicated in skeletal homeostasis,suggesting counter-regulatory mechanisms afforded by sensoryand sympathetic innervation coexist to maintain bone homeo-stasis, for example, by coordinating opposing effects on vasculartone or osteoblast function.(1)Additionally, our work with the Baf53b-tdTomato reporter system suggests that CGRP+ pepti-dergic sensory axons and TH+ sympathetic adrenergic axonsaccount for at least 20% to 30% and 25% to 50%, respectively,of the total nerve population innervating the skeleton.Non-peptidergic sensory axons and sympathetic cholinergic axonshave been reported to target the skeleton (23,40,54,55)but have not been reliably marked and mapped.
Identifying the full com-plement of neural subpopulations that innervate the bone repre-sents an important area of future investigation to understand thephysiological role of neuroskeletal interactions. Another key question that needs to be addressed by future work is the localization and prevalence of signaling sites thatallow nerves to communicate with skeletal target cells or tosense target tissue signals.True synapses have not been found in bone, consistent with non-synaptic neurotransmitter release from sympathetic and small/medium sensory ﬁbers in more thoroughly characterized peripheral target tissues such as skinand smooth muscles of the intestine and arterioles.(56)Instead, vesicular release of neurotransmitters likely occurs en passage at axon varicosities devoid of myelin.This means that vesicularneurotransmitter release, in addition to other nerve-mediatedsignaling events, can occur along the length of the axon in addi-tion to at the end.
These putative release sites have been previ-ously identi ﬁed along the length of the distal axons in the vicinity of skeletal target cells by ultrastructural analysis by ourlab as well as others. (21,22,57 –59)In the future, super-high- resolution immuno ﬂuorescent imaging of presynaptic markers in combination with ultrastructural analysis of vesicle-rich,myelin-free varicosities will be required to de ﬁnitively assess neurotransmitter release sites along the length of skeletal axons,similar to what has been achieved for sympathetic neuroeffectorjunctions on arrector pili muscles attached to the hair follicle.(60) Although this type of work is beyond the scope of the currentstudy, it is our intention that the map of skeletal axons providedhere serves as a guide to examine sites of neuroskeletal commu-nication in more targeted regions of interest in future studies.As detailed throughout the atlases, bone is intimately associ- ated with the nervous, vascular, and muscular systems.
Particu-larly exciting potential exists in overlaying this neuroskeletalmap with whole-bone maps of load-induced strain andadaptation, (61)vascularity,(49)and stem-cell distribution(62,63)to elucidate more de ﬁned functional roles of skeletal axons. Perios- teal axon patterning, which we have characterized and de ﬁned as type I –III, is aligned to connections of muscle and fascia to the bone.Strain maps could be related to periosteal innervationpatterns to give insight to their functional role in load-inducedadaptation; type II anchored/diving axons may integrate muscle cues to the loaded bone, while axons in type III fascial/parallel regions might amplify bone formation on surfaces that lack largeconnective tissue strain.The endocortical surface, by contrast, isrelatively aneural and likely derives its regulation primarily fromthe underlying osteocyte network in addition to the adjacentbone marrow and stromal compartment.
Axonal orientation isless de ﬁned in the bone marrow, but TH+ ﬁbers generally cluster around central arterioles, whereas CGRP+ axons are moredisperse (Supplemental Files A –D). The non-overlapping sensory and sympathetic axons within the bone marrow may be sugges-tive of spatially de ﬁned mechanisms regulating unique progeni- tor cell pools.(18,20)The axonal patterning in the periosteum and bone marrow was largely conserved in the mice characterized inthis study, irrespective of sex or strain.Additionally, this workhighlights the need to consider the role of Schwann cells in thebidirectional cross-talk between nerves and bone.Schwann cellsnot only insulate axons but can also initiate and modulate neuralsignaling, as well as contribute to tissue repair, (64–66)and remain an underexplored component of the neuroskeletal system.
As we move forward, it is clear that a systematic and compre- hensive map of skeletal innervation related to region-speci ﬁc bone surfaces and bone marrow compartments is fundamentalto assigning physiologic functions to local neuronal populations.In addition, the neuroskeletal ﬁeld needs standardized nomen- clature to facilitate more comprehensive and cohesive studies.In this resource, we have provided protocols and easy-to-applymethods for axon visualization and quanti ﬁcation. Quantifying the length and density of skeletal axons using semi-automatedtracing with Simple Neurite Tracer (27)can overcome non-uniform localization of the labeled molecules and inherent differences in staining and ﬂuorophore signal-to-noise ratios for comparative studies.
Based on our analysis of the Baf53b-tdTomato reporter,neuroskeletal quanti ﬁcation using axon-localized neurotransmit- ters and enzymes is accurate when strict morphologic criteria areapplied but may underestimate the true length of the axonswhen the immunotarget is intermittent. When possible, we rec-ommend the use of genetically encoded reporter systems suchas Baf53b-tdTomato for tracking and mapping of skeletal axons.At present, two-dimensional quanti ﬁcation is somewhat limited by orientation of the axon to the plane of the section, but thismethodology can be extrapolated to 3D analysis when light-sheet microscopy and high-computational power are moreaccessible.In addition, we have presented four interactiveatlases that can be applied as a reference during study design,implementation, and interpretation.Lastly, based on this work,we propose that future studies report several basic metrics tohelp to unify the ﬁeld.
Speci ﬁcally, (i) section orientation (trans- verse, longitudinal), (ii) the analyzed level along the length ofthe bone (eg, 40% from the knee), (iii) the bone surface (eg, ante-rior tibial ridge), and (iv) the axon pattern(s) analyzed (eg, types IIand/or III). This will help to ensure reproducibility between stud-ies while moving the ﬁeld toward development of new therapies for treatment of musculoskeletal pain and disease.Disclosures All authors state that they have no con ﬂicts of interest.Acknowledgments This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, including U01-DK116317 (ELS) and T32-AR060719(JMB, ATB).We are thankful to the Musculoskeletal Research Cen-ter (MRC, P30-AR074992) and the Washington University Centerfor Cellular Imaging (WUCCI), with particular thanks to JamesFitzpatrick and Peter Bayguinov, for their support.In addition,we thank Jeff Stirman at SmartSPIM for generating the lightsheetimage used in this publication.
