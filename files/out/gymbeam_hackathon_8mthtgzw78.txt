General anesthesia with cisatracurium and sevoﬂurane for a patient with primary carnitine deﬁciency receiving L-carnitine therapy A case report Ling Ai, Yan Fang, MD∗ Abstract Rationale: Lipid storage myopathies (LSMs) are a series of genetic disorders of lipid metabolism predominantly affecting muscle.The low incidence and lethal properties of this disease make anesthesia experience limited in such patients.Among all etiologies ofLSMs, primary carnitine de ﬁciency (PCD) is now considered highly treatable by early administration of L-carnitine, though it remains unclear whether L-carnitine is effective enough to protect diseased muscle against conventionally used neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) during general anesthesia.Currently, no data are available concerning possible prolonged muscle weakness inthese cases.
Patient concerns: This case presents a 43-year-old female who was diagnosed with a PCD-induced LSM 3 years ago due to fatigability and exertional myalgias and has been treated with L-carnitine ever since. At the time of this report, she was admitted foruterine ﬁbroids and scheduled for selective open gynecologic surgery under general anesthesia.Diagnosis: The patient ’s diagnosis of PCD-induced LSM was based on the clinical features, muscle biopsy, and diminished organic cation/carnitine transporter 2 (OCTN2) transporter activity in the patient ’s skin ﬁbroblasts.Interventions: L-carnitine was taken by the patient until the morning of surgery.General anesthesia with cisatracurium and sevo ﬂurane was selected as the anesthetic plan during the operation.The train-of-four (TOF) test was adopted as additional monitoring, particularly to track the recovery of neuromuscular function.Outcomes: The patient was extubated successfully following a spontaneously restored TOF ratio (TOFR) of 0.9.
Nonetheless, we recorded a prolonged ef ﬁcacy of cisatracurium in the clinical duration and the recovery time with TOFRs of 0.7 and 0.9, respectively. Lessons: The conventional dose of cisatracurium combined with a low dose of sevo ﬂurane can be safely used in patients with LSMs without additional anesthetic risks.Meanwhile, continuous TOF monitoring is recommended to perform high-quality anesthesia.Abbreviations: BIS=Bispectral index, ECG =Electrocardiography, HR =Heart rate, LSMs =Lipid storage myopathies, MAC=Minimum alveolar concentration, NIBP =Non-invasive blood pressure, NMBAs =Neuromuscular blocking agents, OCTN2 =Organic cation/carnitine transporter 2, PCD =Primary carnitine de ﬁciency, SpO2 =Pulse oximetry, TOF =Train-of-four, TOFC =Train-of-four count, TOFR =Train-of-four ratio.Keywords: cisatracurium, L-carnitine, lipid storage myopathies, primary carnitine de ﬁciency, sevo ﬂurane Editor: Maya Saranathan.

As one ofthe four etiological factors of LSMs, primary carnitine de ﬁciency (PCD) is caused by dysfunctional organic cation/carnitine transporter 2 (OCTN2) due to a mutation in the SLC22A5gene. [1]The subsequent inability of lipids to fuel as alternative sources of energy can be associated with many metabolic disorders of fatty acids.Lipid metabolic organs such as the heart, liver, brain and skeletal muscle, are major targets of thispathological alteration, where skeletal muscle is most commonly involved.Patients suffering from PCD usually present with myopathic manifestations such as ﬂuctuating weakness, hypoto- nia, myalgia, and abnormal fatigability.[2–4]When anesthesia is required for such patients, the pre-existing myopathy and underlying multiple organ insuf ﬁciencies must be taken into account, and considerably more attention should be given to those issues during anesthesia management.
However, reports on the anesthesia experience with PCD patients are very limited due to its low incidence (1:40,000 to1:120,000). [5,6]Although progressive PCD leads to life-threaten- ing complications such as respiratory muscle weakness, L- carnitine supplementation is extremely effective in correcting andmaintaining organ function within normal limits for a long time.[7–9]Owing to a longer life expectancy with the treatment of L-carnitine, patients with PCD may experience more surgicalpossibilities.Furthermore, well-tolerated general anesthesia would enhance their chances of being treated by surgery successfully, and this is urgently needed in this population.However, as conventional general anesthetics, neuromuscularblocking agents (NMBAs) have long been questioned for their safety in patients with myopathy, mainly due to the risk of prolonged postoperative muscle weakness, which may resultfrom the susceptibility of damaged muscle tissues to NMBAs.
In this case, cisatracurium was chosen among multiple NMBAs, for its unique Hofmann elimination, which implicates spontaneousdegradation in plasma and tissues. We hypothesized that the long-term regular administration of L-carnitine would be effective in combating pre-existing myopathy in this patient,thus ensuring a normal metabolic rate of cisatracurium.To validate the hypothesis, train-of-four (TOF) and other related NMBA pharmacodynamic indices were recorded as the criteriafor extubation.In addition, we chose sevo ﬂurane for intraop- erative anesthesia maintenance to reduce the dose of NMBA.In the present study, we described the case of anesthesia management in a PCD patient under the context of L-carnitinetreatment and highlighted the ef ﬁciency and safety of cis- atracurium combined with a low dose of sevo ﬂurane on pre- existing myopathy in this patient.2.
Methods Ethical review and approval were not required for this study on a human participant in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements. The patient provided written in-formed consent to participate in this study.3.Case report A 43-year-old female patient was scheduled for selective panhysterectomy owing to uterine ﬁbroids.Her symptoms offatigability and exertional myalgias began 3years ago.A histochemical examination displayed pronounced features of aLSM characterized by the appearance of abnormal storage of triglyceride droplets in muscle ﬁbers (Fig.1).No other family members or immediate relatives showed similar symptoms exceptfor her younger sister.The diagnosis of PCD was subsequently established according to the diminished OCTN2 transporter activity in the patient ’s skin ﬁbroblasts.The genetic analysis could not be conducted due to her sister ’s unwillingness to participate.
The patient reported a dramatic improvement in muscle strength after taking L-carnitine (1g bid, orally). Aphysical examination revealed the patient ’s muscle strength was at level 3/5 in her limbs, while no apparent atrophy was observed.There were no obvious abnormalities shown by preoperative chest radiography, electrocardiogram or echocardiogram.Inaddition, the routine laboratory ﬁndings including the results of liver and renal function tests were all within normal limits.L-carnitine was administered as usual on the morning of the surgery.Upon the patient ’s arrival in the operating room, routine intravenous access and noninvasive monitoring were established.To monitor the intraoperative arterial pressure and serumglucose, a 22-gauge radial arterial cannula was inserted by puncturing the left forearm before anesthetic induction.The patient ’s preoperative blood glucose was 5.2mmol/L.
Intraop- erative monitoring included non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP),heart rate (HR), pulse oximetry (SpO2), electrocardiography (ECG), end-tidal carbon dioxide levels, and core temperature. Additionally, the bispectral index (BIS) was adopted foranesthesia depth monitoring and TOF was used for neuromus- cular function assessment.After the patient was preoxygenated, general anesthesia was induced with sufentanil (6 mg/kg) followed by propofol (2mg/kg).Continuous monitoring with TOF (Mindray 3-directional neuromuscular transmission trans- ducer acceleromyography module, Shenzhen, China) wasperformed through supramaximal ulnar nerve stimulation (2Hz/2s per 2min) as described by Naguib et al.[10]After achieving a stable baseline measurement, an initial dose of cisatracurium (0.15mg/kg) was injected to facilitate tracheal intubation.
Theprotocol for anesthesia maintenance consisted of remifentanil (0.15mg/kg/min) and sevo ﬂurane (0.88 ∼1.71 minimum alveolar concentration, MAC) mixed with 60% air oxygen, while the BISwas maintained between 45 –55. The patient received a total of three repeated doses of cisatracurium (0.05mg/kg).One dose was given when the ﬁrst twitching response of the TOF (T1) attained only 5% control due to the surgeon ’s complaint of abdominal tension; another two doses were administered when T1 attained 25% control.All three doses of cisatracurium led to 100%neuromuscular blockade.After the last injection, four pharma-codynamic parameters of cisatracurium were recorded.The results showed that the clinical duration (return of T1 to 25% baseline), recovery index (T1 25% –75%), time to achieve T4/T1 ratio (TOFR) of 0.7 and 0.9 of cisatracurium were 77min, 21 min, 94min and 101min, respectively (Table 1).
Figure 2 summarizes the entire process of neuromuscular function changeoccurred during surgery. The entire surgical procedure lasted 162 min, during which the patient ’s intraoperative serum glucose was consistently above 5.0mmol/L and her core temperatureremained stable at 36.4 °C.The patient was successfully extubated following spontaneously restored TOFR to 0.9 even in the absence of the antagonist neostigmine.Thereafter, thepatient was transferred to the postoperative anesthesia care unitfor further evaluation.No perioperative or anesthetic compli-Ai and Fang Medicine (2021) 100:38 Medicine 2 cations occurred.Finally, the patient was discharged home on the ﬁfth postoperative day.4.Discussion PCD is a rare but worldwide autosomal recessive disorder caused by the lack of functional OCTN2 in the human body, which results in a marked decrease in carnitine uptake and an increase inurinary carnitine loss.
[5,6,11,12]PCD can be fatal if early diagnosis and intervention do not occur promptly. When the carnitine level is insuf ﬁcient to assist fatty acids across into the mitochondrial membrane for energy production, organs such as the heart, skeletal muscles, and brain are unable to use fat as spare energy during prolonged aerobic work or fasting.Nevertheless,unusable lipids are still released into plasma during fasting.Their entry into the liver, skeletal muscle, and heart may interfere strongly with the physiological functions of these vital organs.Anesthesiologists should be aware of the potential impact ofgeneral anesthesia on PCD patients.To date, there are only a fewreported cases concerning the use of NMBAs and inhalation anesthetics in these patient groups.Of the three known case reports, two patients were treated with NMBAs and one of themhad received continuous carnitine treatment.Inhalational anesthetic agents were adopted in all cases for anesthesia maintenance.
No signi ﬁcant prolonged muscle relaxation times have been reported, and all three anesthetic courses were completely uneventful. [12–14]However, none of the cases reported the exact pharmacodynamics of NMBAs.Our reportwas the ﬁrst to provide pharmacodynamic data on cisatracurium in PCD patients in the context of carnitine treatment.Figure 1.Electron microscopy images of the patient ’s skeletal muscle biopsy.(A) shows the extensive distribution of triglycerides in the skeletal muscle ﬁbers; the arrow in (B) indicates the abnormally accumulated lipid droplets in the muscle.Table 1 Recovery criteria of cisatracurium when co-administrate with sevo ﬂurane [time data present as mean (SD)].Author Patient groupsClinical duration (T125%; min)Recovery index (T125%-75%; min)TOFR=0.7 (min)TOFR=0.8 (min)TOFR=0.9 (min)Sevoﬂurane (MAC) Our case Patients with PCD 77 21 94 101 0.88 ∼1.17 Braga Ade, F.et al 2002[17]Normal population 66.2 (13.42) 23.6 (5.02) 1.17 Cavalcanti, I.L.

Additionally, the potential inhibitory effect of propofol on carnitine palmityl transferase I may further exacerbate PCDand PCD-like disorders.[15]In this regard, we suggest that inhaled anesthetics would be the preferred alternative to propofol for anesthesia maintenance.Furthermore, sevo ﬂurane should take priority over other inhaled anesthetics due to its characteristics of rapid induction, recovery, and minimal biotransformation.
Moreover, exposure to sevo ﬂurane results in additional potentiation of the ef ﬁcacy of an NMBA, and patients with LSMs may bene ﬁt from a reduced dose of NMBAs. Because the impact of NMBAs on muscle weakness in patients with myopathy is uncertain, nonaccumulative NMBAs, which mainlyrely on Hofman elimination, have become the most suitable candidates for PCD patients.When the possible coexisted cardiac complications are taken into consideration, cisatracurium may bethe best option for these patients due to the advantages of its modest effect on blood pressure.Our case is the ﬁrst report of cisatracurium pharmacodynamics under the administration ofsevoﬂurane in patients with PCD.As shown in Table 1, when sevoﬂurane was constantly administered, the clinical duration, and recovery index of cisatracurium in our case were comparableto the mean values in the normal population, elderly individuals,infants, children and those with chronic renal failure.
[16–19] However, at recovery times of TOFRs of 0.7 and 0.9, our data presented a longer recovery pro ﬁle of cisatracurium. A possible explanation for the discrepancy is that different concentrations of sevoﬂurane were used across studies.However, to our knowledge, sevo ﬂurane below 2 MAC would not affect the effective dose of cisatracurium with the increased concentra- tion.[20]Given neither the aforementioned studies nor our case used sevo ﬂurane for more than 2 MAC, sevo ﬂurane cannot be the cause of the prolonged recovery time of TOFRs of 0.7 and 0.9 inour case, while, instead, PCD-induced myopathy might be quite relevant for this issue.As the current gold standard for safe extubation, the spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function to a TOFR of 0.9, in the absence of the antagonist neostigmine is a preferred method for pharmacodynamics research of NMBAs.In thecontext of L-carnitine, our patient demonstrated a complete spontaneous recovery from cisatracurium to a TOFR of 0.9.
Although this case showed a prolonged recovery time with aTOFR of 0.9, the safety of cisatracurium has been fully demonstrated in such patients. It is noteworthy that the surgeon complained of transient tensioning of the abdominal muscles when the TOF monitorshowed an appropriate value that completely met the require- ments for abdominal surgery.PCD-related LSMs may account for this phenomenon.There have been reports of unequalseverities of weakness among different body parts in PCD patients, where the neck and limbs were more susceptible to PCD- induced myopathy than the trunk.[21–23]In our case, L-carnitine supplementation was not capable of eliminating this kind of differential myasthenia.Therefore, we recommended multisite neuromuscular function monitoring for these populations,although the ulnar nerve-adductor pollicis unit has long been regarded as the gold standard to evaluate the effects of NMBAs.
[10] The various clinical manifestations of PCD range from asymptomatic to sudden infant death. Patients with differentages of onset can have different types of presentation, during which milder clinical types are more frequent in adolescence andadulthood and are mostly associated with a muscular presenta- tion.Deadly cardiac or hepatic symptoms usually occur in childhood.[24,25]Based on the variability in clinical features, this disease can be divided into two groups: systemic carnitine deﬁciency is characterized by recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia and hepatic and/or cardiac involvement in infancy or earlychildhood, while myopathic carnitine de ﬁciency is often associated with progressive LSMs in adulthood.[2]Of the patients in the second class, increased serum carnitine concentrations cansimultaneously improve skeletal muscle morphology and func-tion.
An elevated serum carnitine level after L-carnitine administration is closely associated not only with reduced lipid droplet accumulation in muscles but also with an enhancedfunctional mitochondrial respiratory chain. [26–28]A 28-year follow-up study showed that regularly taking L-carnitine even allowed a PCD patient for the ability to perform gym-basedexercise, which fully demonstrated the ability of L-carnitine to reverse impaired muscle function.Meanwhile, the rapid recur- rence of fatigue following the discontinuation of L-carnitinehighlights the importance of continuous administration.[9] According to the classi ﬁcation criteria of PCD, our patient had myopathic carnitine de ﬁciency.However, the late-onset or sole presenting myopathic phenotype does not mean that we cansimplify the preoperative examination for patients con ﬁrmed to have PCD.
Electrocardiogram, echocardiography, abdominal ultrasound, and serum transaminase can provide good riskassessments of potentially fatal cardiac and hepatic abnormali- ties. Unfortunately, our case did not include an extra test for serum creatine kinase to assess the severity of myopathy beforesurgery.Because advanced lipid deposition myopathy may exhibit a severe muscular atrophy phenotype, [29]we could only infer from the nearly normal function and morphology of themuscle in this case that there was no or only mild muscleimpairment and therefore assumed that general anesthesia was safe and feasible, with only a minimal risk of delayed recovery from neuromuscular blocking.This is also a limitation of this casereport.Given that prolonged fasting and surgical stress might have caused our patient to face a glucose shortage and lipolysisinitiation, we insisted on regular plasma glucose monitoring during surgery even though no prior symptoms of hypoglycemia had been observed.
No episode of intraoperative hypoglycemiaoccurred in our case despite rapid treatment of glucose- containing intravenous ﬂuids being permitted when necessary. Although oral carnitine supplementation has been reported tosuccessfully maintain appropriate blood concentrations for up to48h, we still would like to emphasize the importance of taking the usual daily dose of carnitine until the morning of surgery.Long- term preoperative fasting should be avoided in PCDpatients.[13,30] 5.Conclusions In summary, this case demonstrated that the long-term administration of L-carnitine provided reassurance on the safety and ef ﬁciency of cisatracurium combined with sevo ﬂurane during general anesthesia in a PCD patient.Continuous neuromuscularmonitoring was recommended to guide rational NMBA consumption.
Additionally, the ulnar nerve-adductor pollocks muscle, as the sole TOF monitoring unit, requires furtherAi and Fang Medicine (2021) 100:38 www.md-journal.com 5 veriﬁcation in abdominal surgery, considering that muscle weakness is more severe in the limb muscles than in theabdomens of patients with PCD.
