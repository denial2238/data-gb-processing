Frailty status was assessed using both the frailty phenotype and frailty index approaches and classi ﬁed as robust, pre-frail, or frail. Changes in frailty status were assessed by frailty phenotype at baseline (2006 –2010) and the follow-up (2012 –2013).Mixed effect model was performed to examine the association between vitamin D levels and frailty status.Using multistate transition models, we assessed the impact of increasing vitamin D levels on the probabilities of transitioning between robust, pre-frail, and frail states.Results Based on the frailty phenotype, 287 926 individuals (64.8%) were identi ﬁed as having various degrees of frailty (median age 58.00 [51.00, 64.00] years, 55.9% females).Using the frailty index approach, 250 566 individuals (56%) were found to have different levels of frailty (median age 59.00 [51.00, 64.00] years, 55.3% females).
Baseline vitamin D levels were found to be signi ﬁcantly associated with frailty status (frailty phenotype: OR frail0.78, 95% CI [0.76, 0.79], P<0.001; frailty index: OR frail0.80, 95% CI [0.78, 0.81], P<0.001). Dynamic changes in vitamin D levels were also found to be associated with changes in frailty over time.Furthermore, increasing vitamin D levels were associated with a transition from frailty to a healthier status.A higher degree of vitamin D (estimated at 1 nmol/L) wasassociated with a lower risk of transitioning from robust to prefrail (HR 0.997, 95% CI [0.995, 0.999]) and from prefrail to frail (HR 0.992, 95% CI [0.988, 0.995]).Conclusions This study highlights the importance of vitamin D in the context of frailty.Low vitamin D levels are asso- ciated with increased frailty risk, while increasing vitamin D levels may contribute to improving frailty status.
Recogniz- ing the relationship between vitamin D levels and frailty can inform personalized management and early interventions for frail individuals. Further research is needed to explore the potential effects of vitamin D interventions on frailty anddeepen our understanding of the biological connections between vitamin D and frailty.Keywords Dynamic changes in vitamin D; Frailty; Frailty risk factors; Transition; Vitamin D Received: 16March 2024 ; Revised: 21May 2024 ; Accepted: 3June 2024 *Correspondence to: Xinfeng Liu and Wen Sun, Department of Neurology, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Centre for Leading Medicine and Advanc ed Technologies of IHM, The First Af ﬁliated Hospital of USTC, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230001 , China.Email: xﬂiu2@ustc.edu.cn and sunwen_medneuro@ 163.comORIGINAL ARTICLE © 2024 The Author(s).Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The frailty index in-volves counting age-related health de ﬁcits, while the frailty phenotype is a speci ﬁc syndrome determined by a combina- tion of low grip strength, weight loss, exhaustion, low physicalactivity, and slow walking pace. 4,5Both measures aim to iden- tify vulnerability to physiological decompensation, setting them apart from related concepts such as multimorbidity.6 Frailty has been shown to signi ﬁcantly increase the risk of adverse health outcomes, including disability, falls, morbidity, long-term care utilization, and mortality.7Additionally, re- search has demonstrated a strong association between frailty and other conditions such as depression, cardiovascular dis- ease (CVD), and dementia.8–10Therefore, recognizing the po- tential relationship between frailty and factors that can mod- ify frailty status would be advantageous for frail individuals, as it would enable them to pursue personalized managementand early interventions.
Vitamin D is essential for maintaining musculoskeletal functions. 11In older adults, vitamin D de ﬁciency can lead to reduced muscle strength and low bone mineral density.11Frail individuals often have inadequate vitamin D levels.Previous studies have shown that vitamin D de ﬁciency increases the risk of frailty and pre-frailty.12However, these studies only consid- ered baseline measurements and did not examine the rela- tionship between changes in vitamin D levels and frailty overtime.Importantly, emerging evidence suggests that frailty may be reversible through appropriate interventions.13There- fore, it is crucial to investigate the potential links betweenchanges in vitamin D levels and the risk of developing frailty.The aim of this study was to investigate the combined im- pact of baseline and longitudinal changes in vitamin D levelson incident frailty status.
Using data from the UK Biobank, we employed two different de ﬁnitions of frailty to investigate the relationship between baseline vitamin D levels and frailty,as well as to examine the association between dynamic changes in Vitamin D and changes in frailty. Furthermore, we aimed to assess how increasing levels of vitamin D are as-sociated with transitioning between different frailty status.Method Study population This study was a prospective, population-based cohort study conducted using data from participants enrolled in the UKBiobank.A total of 502 640 participants were recruited through postal invitation between 2006 and 2010.14The participants attended one of 22 assessment centres acrossEngland, Scotland, and Wales, where they completed a touchscreen questionnaire, underwent a nurse-led interview, and had physical measurements taken.Written informed con-sent was obtained from all participants for data collection, analysis, and linkage.
To be eligible for participation, individ- uals had to be registered with a general practitioner, residewithin a reasonable travelling distance from the assessment center, and be between 40 and 69 years of age. In this study, wave 1 (2006 –2010) was regarded as the baseline.Wave 2 (2012 –2013) was regarded as the second survey.This particu- lar study was conducted under the UKB Resource application number 106487.Sample collection and vitamin D concentration During the recruitment and follow-up process, blood sampleswere collected from each participant after an overnightfasting period and stored at /C080°C prior to analysis.Participants were categorized into four groups based on their serum vitamin D levels: <25 nmol/L, 25 –<50 nmol/L, 50–<75 nmol/L, and ≥75 nmol/L.15 Frailty de ﬁnition In this study, we employed two different approaches to as- sess frailty: the frailty phenotype and the frailty index.5,16 Both assessments were performed during the baseline period (2006 –2010).
The frailty phenotype was also measured dur- ing the follow-up period (2012 –2013). The traits that make up the frailty index primarily consist of health de ﬁcits, many of which are long-term morbidities and not easily modi ﬁable.Using the frailty index may prevent us from establishing the dynamic changes in frailty.Therefore, in this study, we fo-cused on observing the dynamic changes in frailty using the frailty phenotype assessment.Frailty phenotype The Fried frailty phenotype evaluates ﬁve indicators to assess frailty: weight loss, exhaustion, low grip strength, physical in- activity, and slow walking speed (Table S1).5The severity of frailty is determined by the number of criteria met, resulting in a score ranging from 0 to 5.In our study, participants were categorized into three groups based on their ful ﬁlment of the criteria: frail, pre-frail, and robust.
Frail individuals were classi ﬁed as those who met three or more of the ﬁve criteria, pre-frail individuals met one or two criteria, and robust individuals did not meet any of the criteria. These three groups were mutually exclusive.The association between dynamic changes in vitamin D and frailty alterations: A prospective analysis of UK Biobank participants 1723 Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2024; 15: 1722 –1732 DOI: 10.1002/jcsm.13525 Frailty index The frailty index approach, developed by Rockwood and Mitnitski, is a comprehensive assessment of de ﬁcits that in- cludes routine clinical data such as symptoms, signs, disabil-ities, and diseases that meet standardized criteria.4,17It calcu- lates the proportion of total health de ﬁcits a person has by dividing the total number of de ﬁcits they exhibit by the total number of measurable de ﬁcits, resulting in a score between 0 and 1.Higher scores indicate a higher degree of frailty.
In our study, we employed a previously validated frailty in- dex comprising 49 self-reported questionnaire items related to health, disease presence, disability, and mental well-being (Table S2).16Using this frailty index, participants were classi- ﬁed into three categories based on their frailty status: robust (FI≤0.10), pre-frail (0.10 <FI<0.25), and frail (FI ≥0.25). Detailed de ﬁnitions of the frailty phenotype and the frailty index can be found in Tables S1 and S2.Covariates Participants ’age, sex, smoking status, and drinking status were obtained using a self-completed touchscreen question- naire.Smoking status and drinking status were categorized into three groups: never, previous, and current.To assess so-cioeconomic deprivation, the Townsend deprivation index was calculated based on the participant ’s postcode and the preceding national census output areas.18A higher score on this index indicates a higher level of socioeconomic depriva- tion.
Ethnicity was self-reported and categorized into white, black, Asian, and other or mixed ethnic background. Partici-pants also self-reported their hours of sleep, which were cat- egorized as normal (7 –9 h), long ( >9 h), or short ( <7 h).In addition, we collected information on sunshine expo- sure time, vitamin D supplementation status, and weekly ex- ercise time.Statistical analysis Descriptive characteristics are reported using means and standard deviations (SDs) for quantitative variables thatfollowed a normal distribution.For variables that were not normally distributed, medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were used.Categorical variables are presented as frequenciesand percentages.To investigate the association between baseline vitamin D levels and the risks of frailty status and individual frailty phe-notype items, a mixed effects model was employed with the assessment centre considered as a random effect.
The odds ratio (OR) and its corresponding 95% con ﬁdence interval (CI) were calculated. Three models were ﬁtted, with robust participants serving as the reference group.Model 1 adjustedfor age, sex, and ethnicity.Model 2 included additional multi- variable adjustments for smoking status, drinking status, and the Townsend deprivation index.Model 3 further adjustedfor physical activity time, vitamin D supplementation, and sunshine exposure time.Similarly, we used the same method- ology to analyse the associations between changes in vitaminD levels and changes in frailty status.Vitamin D levels at baseline and follow-up were categorized into four groups: stable low, stable high, increase, and decrease, based on acutoff of 75 nmol/L.The changes in frailty status can be cat- egorized as stable robust, robust to prefrail/frail, prefrail to robust, prefrail to frail, frail to robust/prefrail, and stableprefrail/frail.
To examine the non-linear relationships between vitamin D levels and frailty risk, we employed restricted cubic splineanalysis. Furthermore, we utilized multistate Markov models to analyse the associations between baseline vitamin D levels and the probabilities of transitioning between different frailtystates.The hazard ratio (HR) and its corresponding 95% CI were calculated.In addition, we generated predictive proba- bility plots to visualize the relationship between vitamin Dlevels and frailty status.We also conducted subgroup analyses to assess the impact of vitamin D on frailty status in sex (men vs.women) and age(<60 vs.≥60).In addition, we created probability graphs to examine the occurrence of prefrailty and frailty in different sexes and age groups as vitamin D levels changed.Several sensitivity analyses were conducted: (i) To account for sample attrition, an inverse probability of attrition weighting (IPAW) analysis was employed.
This analysis esti-mated the probability of frailty status at baseline and follow-up using multivariate-adjusted logistic regressions. The inverse of these probabilities was then utilized as weightsin the corresponding analysis, ensuring that attrition did not bias the results.(ii) To handle missing values for covariates, individuals with missing data were excluded from the analy-sis, and the analysis was conducted using the complete dataset.All statistical analyses were conducted using R software (Version 4.1.2).P-values were two-sided, and P<0.05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant.Results Baseline characteristics of the study population After excluding participants with missing data for vitamin D and frailty phenotype items, a total of 444 382 participants were included in the current study for the analysis of frailty phenotype (Figure 1).Among them, 35 697 (8%) participants met the criteria for frailty, while 252 229 (56.8%) participants were categorized as pre-frail.1724 P.
Zhang et al . Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2024; 15: 1722 –1732 DOI: 10.1002/jcsm.13525 For the analysis of frailty index, after excluding participants with missing data for vitamin D and frailty index items, a total of 447 515 participants were included (Figure 1).Among them, 21 122 (4.7%) participants met the criteria for frailty, while 229 444 (51.3%) participants were categorized as pre- frail.The baseline characteristics of the frailty phenotype are presented in Table 1, and the baseline characteristics of the frailty index categories are shown in Table S3.Bothdeﬁnitions of frailty showed that frail individuals were older, more likely to be women, and had lower levels of vitamin D (P<0.001).
Association of baseline vitamin D with frailty status When using the frailty phenotype de ﬁnition, compared to robust individuals, higher baseline vitamin D levels were as- sociated with a lower risk of being pre-frail (OR 0.82, 95%CI 0.82, 0.83) and frail (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.57, 0.59) in Model 1. These associations were slightly attenuated but still signi ﬁcant after adjusting for vitamin D supplementa- tion and other factors in Model 3 (OR pre-frail 0.90, 95% CI 0.90, 0.91; OR frail 0.78, 95% CI 0.76, 0.79) (Table 2).Similar results were observed when using the frailty index(Table 2).Table S4 presents the demographic characteristics of indi- viduals categorized by serum vitamin D levels.Among them,394 335 individuals (88.7%) were categorized as having insuf- ﬁcient vitamin D levels, while 59 326 individuals (13.3%) were classi ﬁed as de ﬁcient in vitamin D.
Compared with the group with suf ﬁcient serum vitamin D levels ( ≥75 nmol/L), individuals with lower serum vitamin Dlevels demonstrated higher odds of being pre-frail. Speci ﬁ- cally, the ORs and corresponding 95% CIs were as follows: 50–75 nmol/L versus ≥75 nmol/L (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02, 1.07), 25 –50 nmol/L versus ≥75 nmol/L (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.16, 1.21), and <25 nmol/L versus ≥75 nmol/L (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.36, 1.45).Similarly, individuals with lower serum vi-tamin D levels had higher odds of being frail compared with robust individuals: 50 –75 nmol/L versus ≥75 nmol/L (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.04, 1.36), 25 –49 nmol/L versus ≥75 nmol/L (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.29, 1.47), and <25 nmol/L versus ≥75 nmol/L (OR 2.15, 95% CI 2.00, 2.31) (Table S5).Similar re- sults were observed in the analysis using the frailty index(Table S5).Figure 2Aillustrates the nonlinear ‘L-shaped ’relationship between vitamin D concentration and the risk of pre-frailty,with a gradual decrease in risk.
A cutoff point at 43.618 nmol/L was identi ﬁed, indicating a higher risk of pre-frailty below this threshold. Similarly, Figure 2Bshows a nonlinear ‘L-shaped ’pattern between vitamin D concentra- tion and the risk of frailty, with a cutoff point at 30.729 nmol/L, below which the risk of frailty is higher.Figure S1 displays the probability of frailty status (stable, pre-frail, and frail) in relation to vitamin D levels.As vitamin D concentration increases, the probability of being in the sta-ble category increases, while the probabilities of being pre-frail and frail decrease.
Association of baseline vitamin D with components of frailty phenotype Elevated serum levels of vitamin D were associated with an increased risk of weight loss (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.05, 1.07), a Figure 1 Flow chart.The association between dynamic changes in vitamin D and frailty alterations: A prospective analysis of UK Biobank participants 1725 Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2024; 15: 1722 –1732 DOI: 10.1002/jcsm.13525 Table 1 Baseline characteristics by frailty category at baseline and follow up CharacteristicFrailty phenotype at baseline Frailty phenotype at follow up Robust Pre-frail Frail P Robust Pre-frail Frail P No.

Among the initial group of robust participants, 58.2% transitioning to pre-frail or frail status.Conversely, among the initial group of frail participants, 50.6% exhibited an improvement, transitioning to pre-frail or robust status.The baseline characteristics of the partici-pants, categorized based on their change in frailty status, can be found in Table S7.The characteristics of the popula- tions in serum vitamin D levels increased, remained thesame, or decreased was presented in Table S8.
Compared to stable low vitamin D, stable high vitamin D (OR 0.80, 95%CI[0.65, 0.99]) and decrease in vitamin D (OR0.77, 95%CI[0.63, 0.93]) are less likely to transition from ro- bust to pre-frail/frail. Compared to stable low vitamin D, sta- ble high vitamin D is also less likely to transition from pre-frailto frail (OR 0.50, 95%CI[0.33, 0.77]).Stable high vitamin D is less likely to transition from frail to robust/pre-frail (OR, 0.48, 95%CI[0.26, 0.90]).Vitamin D decrease is less likely totransition from pre-frail to robust (OR 0.72, 95%CI[0.55, 0.93]).Vitamin D increase is less likely to transition from pre-frail to frail (OR 0.48, 95%CI[0.32, 0.73]).Compared tostable low vitamin D, vitamin D decrease (OR 0.65, 95%CI [0.54, 0.78]), stable high (OR 0.53, 95%CI[0.43, 0.65]), and in- crease (OR 0.73, 95%CI[0.60, 0.88]) are less likely to maintainstable pre-frail/frail (model 3; Figure 4and Table S9).

The results indicate that a higher degree of vitamin D (estimated in 1 nmol/L) is associated with a lower risk of transitioning from robust to prefrail (HR0.997, 95% CI [0.995, 0.999]) and from prefrail to frail (HR 0.992, 95% CI [0.988, 0.995]).Additionally, a higher degree of vitamin D is associated with a higher risk of returning to ro-bust status in individuals who were classi ﬁed as prefrail (HR 1.004, 95% CI [1.001, 1.007]), and a higher risk of returning to prefrail status in those who were classi ﬁed as frail (HR 1.007, 95% CI [1.002, 1.012]).Subgroup analyses The association between vitamin D and frailty remainedconsistent in subgroup analyses (Tables S10 and S11).
Amongparticipants with equal levels of vitamin D, women had a signiﬁcantly higher probability of being prefrail or frail compared to men, while participants aged ≥60 had a higher probability of frailty (Figures S2 and S3). The restricted cubic spline of the association between vitamin D and frailty status for men and women were shown in Figure S4.Sensitivity analyses The association between baseline vitamin D and incidentFrailty events remained consistent in the following analyses:when using IPAW analyses and the complete dataset (Table S12 –16).Figure 3 Distribution of frailty status transitions.The text on the left indicates the frailty state at baseline.1728 P.Zhang et al .Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2024; 15: 1722 –1732 DOI: 10.1002/jcsm.13525 Discussion This study utilized a large prospective database to analyse the association between baseline vitamin D and dynamic changes in vitamin D with frailty status.
The key ﬁndings of the study are as follows: (1) Vitamin D insuf ﬁciency and de ﬁciency are prevalent in the elderly, affecting 88.7% with insuf ﬁcient and 13.3% with deﬁcient vitamin D. (2) Pre-frailty is common in the popula- tion, with 51.3 –56.8% of individuals experiencing pre-frail status.(3) Low serum vitamin D levels were associated witha higher likelihood of frailty.There was a non-linear relation- ship between baseline vitamin D and frailty and pre-frailty.The risk was higher when the cutoff points were at 43.618and 30.729 nmol/L.(4) Vitamin D was associated with weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, slow gait speed, and low grip strength.(5) Dynamic changes in vitamin D were re-lated to changes in frailty status.Frailty transition is a dy- namic process, and higher vitamin D levels were associated with a lower risk of developing prefrailty and progressing tofrailty.
Additionally, higher vitamin D levels were associated with a higher possibility of transitioning from frailty to prefrailty and to robust status. Vitamin D insuf ﬁciency and de ﬁciency have become a global issue, with 88.7% of individuals having insuf ﬁcientlevels and 13.3% having de ﬁcient levels in this study.Vitamin Dd eﬁciency is highly prevalent among older adults, posing a signiﬁcant threat to their health and quality of life.19 The insuf ﬁcient and de ﬁcient levels of vitamin D in older adults may be caused by several factors.Firstly, age-related decline in kidney function may affect the metabolism andactivation of vitamin D.20Second, older adults often have lim- ited outdoor activities and sunlight exposure, which further restricts their ability to naturally obtain vitamin D.Addition-ally, there may be a decrease in dietary intake of vitamin D among older adults, which contributes to insuf ﬁcient levels.
21 The de ﬁciency and insuf ﬁciency of vitamin D in older adults may lead to a range of health issues. Vitamin D insuf ﬁciency is closely associated with bone health problems, including an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures.15 Furthermore, vitamin D insuf ﬁciency is linked to weakened immune function, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, de- creased muscle function, and cognitive decline.22,23Vitamin D plays a role in skeletal muscle, directly affecting muscle strength and function.Studies have shown that vitamin D is related to an increased risk of falls, fractures, and poorerphysical performance, which directly in ﬂuence the process of frailty.24 This study found an association between vitamin D and factors such as weight loss, fatigue, low physical activity, slow gait speed, and decreased grip strength, further con ﬁrming this observation.The association may involve multiplemechanisms.One possible mechanism is muscle function and energy metabolism.
Vitamin D plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle function and energy metabolism. It is in-volved in regulating muscle contraction, protein synthesis, and skeletal muscle function.Vitamin D de ﬁciency may result in decreased muscle strength, reduced muscle mass, anddisrupted energy metabolism, which can impact weight con- trol and physical activity capacity.25Table 4 Vitamin D and FI transition probabilities Transition HR (95% CI) Robust to prefrail 0.997 (0.995, 0.999) Robust to frail 1.101 (0.999, 1.213)Prefrail to robust 1.004 (1.001, 1.007)Prefrail to frail 0.992 (0.988, 0.995) Frail to robust 0.952 (0.139, 6.540) Frail to prefrail 1.007 (1.002, 1.012) Figure 4 The association between change in vitamin D and change in frailty status.The depth of colour represents the magnitude of the odds ratio (OR), with darker shades indicating larger OR values.The symbol ‘*’denotes statistical signi ﬁcance at P<0.05.The y-axis represents the change in vitamin D levels.

Inﬂammation and immune function are also related to vitamin D. Vitamin D has anti-in ﬂammatory and immune- regulatory effects.23Vitamin D de ﬁciency may lead to de- creased immune function and increased in ﬂammation, resulting in fatigue and decreased physical activity capacity.Obesity is closely linked to in ﬂammation, as individuals with obesity often experience chronic low-grade in ﬂammation.30 Vitamin D can help alleviate in ﬂammation and potentially contribute to weight reduction..23 Bone health is another important aspect in ﬂuenced by vi- tamin D.Vitamin D de ﬁciency may contribute to osteoporosis and skeletal muscle function decline, which can affect gaitspeed and grip strength, among other muscle functions.31 The nervous system also plays a crucial role in the associationbetween vitamin D and muscle function.Vitamin D is in-volved in neurodevelopment and the regulation of neural functions, including nerve conduction, neuromuscular coordi- nation, and motor control.
32Vitamin D de ﬁciency may affect the functioning of the nervous system, thereby in ﬂuencing gait speed and grip strength.33These mechanisms may inter- twine and interact with each other. Further research isneeded to explore the speci ﬁc mechanisms underlying these associations.This study indicates that 51.3 –56.8% of individuals experi- ence prefrail, and 4.7 –8% experience frail.Frailty refers to the loss of physical and mental states, leading to a decrease in the individual ’s demands for physical activity, cognitive abili- ties, and emotional states.Frailty can be temporary or persis- tent.Research suggests that individuals in the pre-frailty stage are more likely to develop frailty compared tonon-frail individuals, and those in the early stages of frailty are more sensitive to intervention measures.Therefore, it is important to focus on screening for pre-frailty in older pa-tients and actively provide interventions.
This study demonstrates an association between vitamin D and frailty status, showing a non-linear relationship. Thestudy found that the risk of frail and pre-frailty increased when vitamin D levels were below 30.729 and 43.618 nmol/ L.Moreover, using a Markov polymorphic model, this studyanalysed the association between vitamin D and changes in frailty status.The analysis found that for every increase in vitamin D unit, the risk of transitioning from robust topre-frailty or frailty decreased.It also found that the likeli- hood of transitioning from frailty to pre-frailty increased.To the best of our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to investigate the association between dynamic changes in vitamin D and changes in frailty status.The analysis found that higher levels of vitamin D were associated with a lowerlikelihood of transitioning from robust to pre-frailty/frailty status.
Stable high vitamin D levels were also less likely to transition from pre-frailty to frailty or from frailty to robust/pre-frailty. Moreover, a decrease in vitamin D levels was less likely to result in a transition from pre-frailty to robust status, while an increase in vitamin D levels was less likely to resultin a transition from pre-frailty to frailty.Overall, stable high and increasing vitamin D levels were associated with a re- duced likelihood of maintaining pre-frailty/frailty status.This study offers preliminary evidence of the association between changes in vitamin D and changes in frailty status, providing a basis for a better understanding of the relation-ship between vitamin D and frailty.It helps uncover the mechanisms by which vitamin D in ﬂuences frailty and offers a new perspective for the prevention and management offrailty.
The ﬁndings suggest that changes in vitamin D may be related to changes in frailty status, emphasizing the impor- tance of considering vitamin D as a potential in ﬂuencing fac- tor in the development and transition of frailty. The results also provide some clues for frailty interventions.Subgroup analysis revealed that among the study popula- tion, females and individuals over the age of 60 had a higher risk of developing frailty at the same levels of vitamin D com- pared with their counterparts.However, overall, both malesand females, regardless of age ( >60 or<60), showed an as- sociation between vitamin D levels and frailty.This can be at- tributed to factors such as an increased risk of osteoporosis,hormonal changes during menopause, malnutrition including vitamin D de ﬁciency, reduced outdoor activities, and the presence of chronic diseases and medication use.
15,34,35Un- derstanding these factors and their impact on frailty and vita- min D levels is crucial for developing effective interventions and preventive measures for frailty in the elderly, particularlyamong women. This study has several strengths, including a large sample size of 444 382 participants from the UK Biobank, which en-hances the representativeness and reliability of the ﬁndings.Additionally, the study utilized long-term follow-up data, allowing for a better understanding of the relationship be-tween vitamin D and frailty, as well as their dynamic changes over time.Furthermore, the study employed multiple assess- ment methods for frail, providing a more comprehensive andaccurate understanding of the relationship.However, some limitations should be considered.The data source from the UK Biobank may introduce selection bias, asonly those who agreed to participate were included.Therefore, the ﬁndings may not be universally applicable.
Additionally, self-reported data, such as smoking and alcohol1730 P. Zhang et al .Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2024; 15: 1722 –1732 DOI: 10.1002/jcsm.13525 status, sleep duration, etc., may be subject to recall bias or subjective errors, impacting the accuracy of the results.Fur- thermore, while the study conducted multivariable adjust-ments, there may still be potential unmeasured confounders, such as genetic factors, other nutritional statuses, etc., which could in ﬂuence the relationship between vitamin D and frailty.Conclusions This study highlights the importance of vitamin D in thecontext of frailty.Low levels of vitamin D are associated withan increased risk of frailty, while increasing levels of vitamin D may contribute to improving frailty status.Recognizing the relationship between vitamin D levels and frailty can informpersonalized management and early interventions for frail individuals.
However, there is still a need for further research to explore the potential effects of vitamin D interventions onfrailty and deepen our understanding of the biological con- nections between vitamin D and frailty. By investigating these connections, we can develop targeted interventions andstrategies to mitigate frailty and improve the overall well-being of older adults.Conﬂict of interest The authors declared no potential con ﬂicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.Funding The study was supported by Research Funds of Centre for Leading Medicine and Advanced Technologies of IHM No.2023IHM01050.Acknowledgements The authors thank the participants and staff of the UKBiobank for their valuable contributions.Online supplementary material Additional supporting information may be found online in theSupporting Information section at the end of the article.References 1.Clegg A, Young J, Iliffe S, Rikkert MO, Rockwood K.
