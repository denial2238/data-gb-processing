CURRENTOPINION Untangling the role of the microbiome across the stages of HIV disease Alexandra M.Ortiz and Jason M.Brenchley Purpose of review The primate microbiome consists of bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses that dynamically shape and respond to host health and disease.Understanding how the symbiotic relationship between the host andmicrobiome responds to HIV has implications for therapeutic design.Recent findings Advances in microbiome identification technologies have expanded our ability to identify constituents of the microbiome and to infer their functional capacity.The dual use of these technologies and animal models has allowed interrogation into the role of the microbiome in lentiviral acquisition, vaccine efficacy, and theresponse to antiretrovirals.Lessons learned from such studies are now being harnessed to design microbiome-based interventions.
Summary Previous studies considering the role of the microbiome in people living with HIV largely described viral acquisition as an intrusion on the host:microbiome interface. Re-framing this view to consider HIV as anovel, albeit unwelcome, component of the microbiome may better inform the research and development ofpre and postexposure prophylaxes.Keywords HIV, microbiome, SIV INTRODUCTION Anatomic sites exposed to the environment are colonized with bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses,cumulatively referred to as the microbiome.Themicrobiome is diverse, and the composition widelydependent upon the unique environmental factorspresent across the body.A millennium of coevolu- tion with the host has led to a predominantly sym- biotic relationship, with several microbiome-produced metabolites benefitting the host [1,2 &].
Alterations to the composition of the gastrointesti-nal (GI) tract microbiome have been associated withseveral disease states [3] and are considered impor-tant contributors to progressive infection in peoplewith HIV (PWH) and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)-infected Asian macaque nonhuman pri- mates (NHPs). Here, we review recent work on therole of the microbiome composition on HIV and SIVacquisition and disease progression (Fig.1).Although experiments involving animal models contribute significantly to HIV research, questionsremain regarding the usefulness of these models tomicrobiome-related disease outcomes.
Major advan- tages of animal models involve longitudinal poten- tial and the ability to control for variables such asdiet, antibiotic use, and behaviorally-associated riskfactors –parameters that influence the composition of the GI tract microbiome irrespective of infection.Animal models also provide the ability to analyze anatomic sites that can only rarely be obtained from humans. On the other hand, there exists speciesvariability in the composition of the microbiomein these models as compared to human participants[4] and these models are incapable of recapitulatingthe complex variables that contribute to micro-biome individuality across diverse human popula-tions.These limitations suggest that animal models should complement biomedical research, providing Barrier Immunity Section, Laboratory of Viral Diseases, Division of Intramural Research, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA Correspondence to Alexandra M.Ortiz, and Jason M.

Approaches for measurement of the microbiome generally fall into three broad categories –those that involve nucleic acid analysis, those that involvemass spectroscopic and/or proteomic analysis, andthose that involve culture analysis [5] –each meth- odology having its own strength. Nucleic acid anal- ysis is, by far, the most common modality.Sequencing the DNA of bacterial 16S rRNA is robust,bioinformatic pipelines for analysis are wellaccepted, and bacterial taxa within the microbiotaare well annotated.However, 16S analysis identifiesonly the bacterial component of the microbiomeand does not directly provide details related to thefunctionality.As compared to 16S analysis, meta- genomic analysis of microbiome-derived DNA or RNA adds significant advantage in that it isunbiased, broadens bacterial assignment, capturesnonbacterial taxa, and permits more robust func-tional inference.
To best understand the metabolicactivity of the microbiome, however, metabolomicand proteomic analyses are also required [6]. Metabolites produced by the microbiome dis- seminate systemically, calibrating host immunity beyond antigenic interface.One of the most com-monly studied microbiome-derived metabolites istrimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which contributesto cardiovascular disease through currently unknown mechanisms [7,8].Too, tryptophan catab- olites have been associated with HIV disease and maybe related to tryptophan metabolizing bacterial taxa[9], and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production bybacteria represents a significant source of energy forthe host [10].A mechanistic determination of thecontribution of nonhost metabolites to health anddisease represents an important but underexplored area of research.
MICROBIOME-ASSOCIATED DETERMINANTS OF HIV ACQUISITION Understanding how the microbiome contributes to the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infections is anessential next step in ending the HIV epidemic. Indeed, increased risk of HIV acquisition in hetero- sexual women is strongly associated with the pres-ence of a Lactobacillus nondominant vaginalmicrobiome [11], and in men who have sex withmen (MSM) with increased intestinal Prevotella:Bac- teroides [12].Although initial reports describing these findings were cross-sectional, recent retrospec-tive analyses and models have strengthened and refined these associations.As described by Fulcher et al.[13 &&], seroconversion in at-risk MSM was found to associate with unique microbiome-associ-ated features.
Compared to similarly at-risk individ-uals that did not seroconvert over the study period,individuals that seroconverted had decreased fre-quencies of several Bacteroides species and increasedserum inflammatory cytokines and bioactive lipids preceding HIV acquisition. Similarly, Sui et al.[14] observed unexpected variation in cohort suscepti-bility to low-dose intrarectal SIV in the rhesus mac-aque model.Here, susceptibility to SIV acquisitionwas associated with frequencies of rectalCCR5 þKi67þCD4þT-cells and in turn, fecal Prevo- tella:Bacteroides ratios.To experimentally determine whether a dysbi- otic microbiome might contribute to increased sus- ceptibility, we recently utilized the antibioticvancomycin to induce dysbiosis in rhesus macaques[15 &&].As predicted, we observed that pronounced dysbiosis was associated with an increase in suscept-ibility to low-dose intrarectal SIV infection.
Surpris-ingly, however, increased susceptibility was notassociated with direct measures of the microbiome but rather, with measures of perturbed antimicro- bial immunity –namely, reduced rectal T H17 and TH22 frequencies and increased rectal PLA2G2A , GZMB ,LTF,DUOX2 , and SUCNR1 transcripts. Col- lectively, these findings suggest that microbiome-responsive features in host immunity –more so than specific taxa –tune host susceptibility to rectal HIVKEY POINTS /C15The microbiome and microbiome-responsive host features have been associated with an increased risk of sexual lentiviral acquisition in experimental and posthoc studies./C15Epitope mimicry of HIV Env by commensal bacterial antigens may inform the design of mimetics to prime or boost HIV vaccine strategies./C15Antiretroviral-responsive perturbations to the bacterial microbiome may stem from mucosal pathologies, antibacterial cross-resistance, or targeting of nonbacterial components of the microbiome.

VACCINATING FROM WITHIN: COMMENSALS AND THE PRE-EXISTINGREPERTOIRE Although vaccine development has long harnessed adjuvants to stimulate pathogen-associated molec-ular pattern receptors [16], only recently have find-ings described the role of individuals’ microbiomesin vaccine outcomes. The administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to individuals prior to seasonalinfluenza vaccination impairs the generation of antibody responses in subjects with low preexistingantibody titers in addition to enhancing inflamma-tory signatures [17].These perturbations have the potential both to negate protective immunity and to alter the efficacy of functional-derived immunity.Lessons learned from studying the role of the micro-biome in HIV vaccine development may lead to theidentification of novel modalities and strategies.
Eliciting an improved antibody response to HIV envelope is considered the most probable target forgenerating protective immunity due to the early emergence of anti-Env antibodies after HIV infection. Previous work has described epitope mimicrybetween gp41 and commensal bacterial antigens[18,19].A recent publication by Mayer-Blackwellet al.[20 &] reports that from a global survey of 1470 HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) participants,58% of prevaccinated, unexposed participants had FIGURE 1.The primate microbiome is a diverse community of bacterial, eukaryotic, and viral constituents residing in the gastrointestinal lumen (as shown) and other external interfaces.Antigenic and metabolic stimulation by the microbiome mayprime vaccine outcomes, alter susceptibility to lentiviral acquisition, modulate lentiviral disease progression, and fluctuateduring postexposure prophylaxes.These interventions and disease states may also alter homeostasis of the healthymicrobiome.
A detailed understanding of the mechanisms underpinning these dynamic relationships will inform novel, improved therapeutic interventions. 1.Corley MJ, Sacdalan C, Pang APS, et al.Abrupt and altered cell-type specific DNA methylation profiles in blood during acute HIV infection persists despite prompt initiation of ART.PLoS Pathog 2021;17: e1009785.Untangling the role of the microbiome across the stages of HIV disease Ortiz and Brenchley 1746-630X Copyright ©2024 The Author(s).Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.www.co-hivandaids.com 223 detectable anti-gp41 IgG titers –with large geo- graphic variation –whereas anti-gp120 immunoglo- bulin G (IgG) was seen only in 1.5% of participants.Using prevaccination fecal samples, these authorswere able to correlate several taxa of the order Eubac- teriales with preexisting antigp41 IgG levels.
Impor- tantly, these authors noted a strong correlationbetween the magnitude of pre versus postvaccinationantigp41 IgG levels, and linear epitope mapping further revealed a focusing of the gp41 response, suggestive of a recall response [18]. As naturally occurring antigp120 envelope responses expand too late in infection to effectivelyclear HIV [21], understanding whether and howpreexisting antigp120 antibodies are generated willguide vaccine-elicited expansion.In infant rhesusmacaques immunized with varied gp120 protein- based formulations, Jiang et al.[22] observed that that age was the biggest driver of antigp120 IgGplasma levels variation in their study.To determinewhether the developing microbiome might primegp120 immunity, the authors surveyed the fecalmicrobiome and observed that vaccination inducedspecific shifts in Sutterella and Rodentibacter species, which further correlated with antigp120 IgG plasma levels across modalities.
From metagenomic infer- ence analyses, the authors identified that SCFA andbile acid (BA) gene abundance increased in tandemwith Suterella frequencies and correlated with antigp120 IgG, suggesting that targeting SCFA andBA pathways may improve gp120 vaccine efficacy. Antibodies against the conserved CD4-induced (CD4i) epitope work cooperatively with CD4 bind- ing-site antibodies to potently inhibit HIV infection in vitro [23,24].It remains unclear whether the brief conformational exposure of CD4i is sufficient toaccount for estimated anti-CD4i antibody titers in vivo.To ascertain whether the antigenic identity of CD4i antibodies may be commensally derived, Bis-waset al.[25] passively immunized mice with CD4i antibodies 4E9C and 916B2, and isolated antiidio- typic antibodies (aID mAbs).Using these aID to a random 12-mer phage library, these authors identi-fied consensus peptide sequences by homology.
OfaID found to target microbial-associated sequences,the authors found epitope homology with Nocar- dioidaceae and Vibrio vulnificus sequences. Using matching, synthesized peptides, these authors dem-onstrated that a single peptide recognized by Vibrio vulnificus reacted to previously identified CD4i mAbs 4E9C, 17b, and 1F4F and to several of theiridentified aID.Epitopes encoded by this and othercross-reactive bacterium may be useful as a mimeticto prime CD4i in vaccine strategies [24] or in thepurposeful design of oral probiotics [26,27] to boostvaccine efficacy.ANTIRETROVIRALS ...ANTIVIRAL OR ANTIBACTERIAL?Potential roles for antiretrovirals (ARVs) in modu- lating the intestinal microbiome in PWH have beenwidely described [28].
Unlike with HIV infection -where the date of acquisition is often unknown –the introduction of ARVs is a chronologically definableevent and samples from stage-matched individualsshow commonalities in their microbiome and microbial-translocation associated markers [29,30]. Too, the introduction of ARVs in SIV-infected rhesusmacaque models induces immediate effects on theintestinal microbiome [31,32].However, changes inthe microbiome are neither uniformly observed norcategorically similar after lentiviral infection, sug-gesting that further research is warranted.Defining an ‘ARV-associated microbiome’ is complicated by the use of varying ARV regimens across individuals [28].As characterized by Pinto-Cardoso et al.
[33], a cross-sectional examination of the fecal microbiomes of ARV-treated patientsreveals that although individuals on long-termART collectively have distinct diversity measuresas compared to uninfected individuals, there remainmodest but appreciable variations in measures of the microbiome and translocation markers between patients on differing regimens. Too, Hanttu et al.[34] reported increased alpha diversity in individu-als switching from an efavirenz- to a protease inhib-itor-based regimen.Some of the confounding effects of cocktail regimens can be resolved by testing the effects ofARVs –individually or in combination –on bacterial taxa in vitro .A methodical survey of over 1000 marketed drugs against 40 gut bacterial strainsrevealed that 27% of nonantibiotic drugs affectedthe growth of at least one taxon in vitro [35].To assess the effects of HIV ARVs more specifically oncommensal taxa, Rubio-Garcia et al.
cultured 16 ARVs with gut and vaginal human commensal bac-teria in vitro and showed that five have antibacterial activity [36], expanding on previous reports [37]. Additionally, Wallace et al.explored the possibility that the prolonged use of ARVs may contribute toantiviral resistance in susceptible bacterial taxa[38 &].In addition to developing antiviral resistance against the primary ARV, several taxa concerninglydeveloped cross-resistance to other antivirals or,antibacterial resistance.It remains to be seen whether similar findings are observed in patients receiving long term ARVs as either post or preexpo-sure prophylaxes.Despite observed sensitivities of individual bacterial taxa to antivirals in vitro , we previously demonstrated that short courses of ARVs inhealthy rhesus macaques in vivo led only to modestMicrobiome 224 www.co-hivandaids.com Volume 19 /C15Number 5 /C15September 2024 perturbations in the intestinal microbiome and intes- tinal immunity [39].
However, the administration of ARVs led to a generalizable instability of the micro-biome, a measure which has conceptually beenobserved in other studies assessing the micro-biome:ARV interface in vivo [40]. It remains unclear whether ARV-associated bacterial perturbations stemfrom lentiviral-associated mucosal pathologies,direct antibacterial activity, or targeting of nonbac- terial components of the microbiome, as further discussed below.HARNESSING THE POWER OF THE MICROBIOME Therapeutics designed to improve the intestinal microbiome have gained favor as a way to reduce disease progression or to boost immune reconstitu- tion after ARV therapy.As covered more extensivelyin this issue, wholesale efforts to manipulate themicrobiome in HIV and SIV infection include pro-biotic regimens [41 –45] and fecal microbial trans- location [46 –49].
We and others have considered that supplementation of nutrients and metabolitesto stimulate or mimic commensal metabolic output may more naturally improve microbiome function, by allowing the host and microbiome to reciprocallyrecalibrate themselves [50 –52]. In murine models, metabolite supplementation can significantlyimprove intestinal immune function in models ofintestinal disease [53,54].To improve immune func-tion in immunological non-responders (INRs), Luet al.[55] provided INR study participants with whole-protein enteral nutrition formula supple- mentation.With just 3 months of daily treatment,supplemented participants exhibited improved cir-culating T-cell counts, and reduced microbial trans-location and intestinal E.coli .In a more targeted approach, we recently provided oral sodium buty-rate to SIV-infected, ARV-treated macaques andassessed measures of immune reconstitution [56].
No differences were observed in measures of disease progression, the intestinal microbiome, or butyrate-responsive transcriptional pathways as compared tocontrols, however, suggesting that sodium-butyrateadministration is insufficient to improve intestinalimmune parameters in chronically SIV-infectedmacaques. Additional nutritional studies are neededto shed light on the metabolic regimens that best improve immune reconstitution.NONBACTERIAL COMPONENTS OF THE MICROBIOME Metagenomic sequencing, in theory, allows for the identification of all members of the microbiome andrecent data are beginning to explore how eukaryotic and viral constituents contribute to health and dis- ease.Indeed, nonbacterial components of themicrobiome can induce significant immunologicalresponses.
For example, the recently identified Tri- trichomoas muscalis has been identified as a eukary- otic member of the murine microbiome in someanimal facilities and alone induces significantinnate and adaptive immune responses in vivo [57]. Moreover, human infection with cytomegalo- virus is sufficient to drive expansion of large fre-quencies of CD4 þand CD8þT-cells in vivo [58] and the presence of viral STDs such as HPV increasesusceptibility to sexually-acquired HIV acquisition[59].Early analysis of the nonbacterial components of the GI microbiome in PWH and SIV-infected NHPs demonstrated an expansion of the virome and suggested that the expanded virome could con-tribute to GI tract pathology [60,61].Subsequentanalysis found that expansion of the virome wasalso present in plasma of PWH [62].
In PWH, thedegree of virome expansion (particularly Anellovir- idae,Flaviviridae , and Adenoviridae ) and bacterial dysbiosis correlate with measures of immunosup- pression in participants [63 –66], suggesting that lack of immune responses against particular viruses maybe responsible. The composition of the virome,particularly bacteriophages, is also likely influencedby administration of ARVs in PWH [67 &].Whether and how the expanded virome contributes to dis-ease and inflammation in PWH is an active area ofresearch, and interventional studies aimed at reduc- ing particular viruses may lead to reduced inflam- mation.The eukaryotic component of the microbiome too is gaining attention, particularly characteriza-tion of opportunistic yeast and fungi.The complex-ity of the eukaryotic microbiome has been recentlyexplored in several anatomic sites of PWH, withalterations apparent both in the GI tract and oral cavity [68 –70].
Indeed, several taxa associated with fungal opportunistic infections are routinelyexpanded in PWH –including Candida albicans and Pneumocystis jirovecii –and correlate with the degree to which the PWH are immunocompro-mised. The mechanisms underlying these expan-sions are currently unclear [68 –70].Little exploration of the mycobiome in longitudinally obtained samples from SIV-infected Asian macaques has been performed and further work is merited.CONCLUSION The anatomy and functionality of the GI tract isimportant for nearly all facets of health and is aUntangling the role of the microbiome across the stages of HIV disease Ortiz and Brenchley 1746-630X Copyright ©2024 The Author(s).Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.www.co-hivandaids.com 225 focus of considerable research effort in PWH and animal models of HIV.
There are considerable immunological perturbations within the GI tractof both PWH and SIV-infected Asian NHPs whichare associated with focal areas of damage to theepithelial barrier and accumulating studies haveexplored how the composition of the luminalmicrobiome may also contribute [71,72]. The degreeto which the microbiome is ‘druggable’ is an active area of research and how individual microbiome- altering therapeutics may benefit PWH and otherindividuals with diseases where the microbiomemay contribute will continue to benefit from pla-cebo-controlled interventional trials in largecohorts of genetically diverse study participants.Acknowledgements We would like to thank the NIH Medical Arts Branch for their assistance in generating the figure in this manu- script.Financial support and sponsorship Funding for this study was provided in part by the Division of Intramural Research/NIAID/NIH.
