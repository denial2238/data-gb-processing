Understanding the anti-corrosion characteristics of surface modi ﬁcation of h-BN and carbon nanotubes/magnesium composites in simulatedseawater Victor Sunday Aigbodion, *abcAbdulmajeed Abdullah Alayyafd and Chinemerem Jerry Ozoudee In order to address the issues of wettability and scattering between matrix and reinforcement and enhance corrosion resistance, the e ﬀects of incorporating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) into magnesium-carbon nanotubes (Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs) nanocomposites were successfully investigated.An inventive coating withh-BN using a novel electroless chemical deposition technique and double stir casting were used.Thecomposites were produced by varying weight percentages of h-BN (0, 2, 4, and 6).The corrosion testing, microstructural analysis, and physical testing of the samples were carried out.A corrosion resistance of 75.1% was obtained when the 4 weight percent of h-BN content was compared to Mg-0.5% wt% CNTs.
Even though the relative density increased noticeably, this was due to the uniformdispersion of h-BN nanoparticles over the entire surface. Researchers have established that adding4 wt% h-BN to the Mg-0.5 wt% CNT nanocomposite can improve the wettability between Mg and CNTsand enhance the corrosion resistance properties.1 Introduction Hybrid metal matrix nanocomposites (HMMNCs) provide an exciting and promising breakthrough in the domains of mate-rials science and engineering.1,2These materials are created by combining nano bers or nanoparticles with a metal matrix to develop a composite material with enhanced properties.HMMNCs are considered the next generation of metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) for advanced industrial applications due to their many advantages.3The addition of nanoparticles, such as CNTs, graphene, or ceramic nanoparticles, into a metalmatrix can signi cantly enhance the mechanical properties of HMMNCs.
Improved hardness, wear resistance, sti ﬀness, corrosion, and strength are a few instances of this. 4,5Improved stability and heat conductivity make HMMNCs suitable forhigh-temperature applications, such as components used in automobiles and aircra .Because HMMNCs reduce materialweight without sacri cing strength, they are useful in areas where weight reduction is essential, such as in the aircra and automotive industries.6 Applications like electromagnetic shielding or electronic packaging can bene t from HMMNCs' speci c electrical and magnetic properties.7Certain high-molecular-weight nano- composite materials (HMMNCs) have the potential to provideenhanced corrosion resistance in harsh environments, such asoﬀshore projects.8Nanoparticles improve the tribological (wear and friction) and corrosion properties of HMMNCs.This meansthat they can be used in places where corrosion is a problem, like in bearings and other mechanical parts.
9Several industries, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, energy, and more,use HMMNCs. 10They have a lot of potential for usage in highly performance-demanding, cutting-edge technological applica-tions.As technology and materials science advance, HMMNCsare anticipated to play a critical role in supplying materials withenhanced performance and customisable characteristics thatmeet the demands of complex industrial applications.To fully achieve the promise of these state-of-the-art mate- rials, scientists and engineers continue to explore new combi-nations and manufacturing techniques.Several industries,particularly the automotive and aerospace sectors, are showinga great deal of interest in magnesium metal matrix composites.Magnesium metal matrix composites are becoming an indis-pensable material in industrial applications due to theirexceptional properties that outperform those of conventional aFaculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, University of Johannesburg, P.

12Of these rein- forcements, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have garnered the mostattention due to their exceptional properties and capacity todramatically improve the performance of magnesium metalmatrix composites. 13The addition of CNTs signi cantly improves the mechanical properties of the Mg metal matrix composites.Adding CNTs to the Mg matrix makes it stronger and harder, creating a network of reinforcements that e ﬀec- tively stops dislocation movement.14In addition to mechanical improvements, the combination of CNTs with Mg-matrixproduces noticeable bene ts in terms of thermal and elec- trical conductivity.15Consequently, researchers have recently conducted numerous investigations to enhance the mechan-ical, corrosion, tribological, and physical properties of magne- sium metal matrix composites by incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as reinforcements using diverse productiontechniques.
16For instance, Goh et al.17used the powder metal- lurgy technique to create magnesium-CNT composites con-taining 00.3 wt% CNTs. They found a 25% increase in tensilestrength compared to pure magnesium.Upadhyay et al.18 investigated Mg-based composites reinforced with 4 weight percent CNTs.They concluded that the Mg/0.4 wt% CNTs composites enhanced their tensile strength.According to Zhang et al.,19the Mg/0.5 wt% CNTs produced by the electrophoretic deposition process exhibited a tensile strength improvement ofaround 35%.Yakup et al.20studied the corrosion properties of CNTs in Mg and discovered that adding more CNTs below0.2 wt% made the material more resistant to corrosion.Thiswas because the CNTs grouped together and spread out.Nainget al.21mixed Mg with 0.3 and 1.3 wt% CNTs and tested how fast it corroded in simulated seawater.They found that the higher rate of corrosion was caused by microgalvanic action betweenthe Mg matrix (anodic) and the CNTs (cathodic).Saberi et al.
22 and Hiroyuki et al.23found that the galvanic e ﬀect plays a vital role in the corrosion of carbon nanotubes and the AZ31Bmagnesium alloy. The literature above reveals that theincreased corrosion rate of Mg and CNTs stems from themicrogalvanic interaction between the anodic Mg matrix and the cathodic CNTs, which occurs when the CNTs exceed 0.2 wt%.We endeavored to boost the CNT percentage to 0.5% bycoating the CNTs with h-BN, thereby improving their uniformdistribution within the Mg matrix.Adding h-BN as a reinforcingingredient to Mg matrix composites (MMCs) has potential,because of its low coe ﬃcient of friction and ability to lubricate itself, h-BN is an attractive addition to MMCs.High temperaturesettings or vacuum conditions, which restrict the use of tradi- tional liquid lubricants, greatly bene t from the self-lubricating properties of h-BN.24,25 According to a review of the literature, no one has looked into what happens when h-BN is added to Mg/CNTs/h-BNhybrid composites.
These composites combine the bene ts of h-BN in the Mg matrix 25and CNTs.26,27This combination makes the material perfect for usage in both industrial and automotiveapplications. The point of this study is to nd out how h-BN andnano-sized CNTs in uence the microstructure, densi cation, and corrosion resistance of Mg/0.5 wt%/(0 –6 wt%) h-BN composites made by double stir casting.The electroless depo-sition of Ni onto the surfaces of h-BN and CNTs signi cantly improved the wettability between the reinforcements and theMg matrix.2 Materials and method In this study, Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs was used as a base to makehybrid composites that were strengthened with h-BN particlesat 0, 2, 4 and 6 wt%.The experimental protocols employeda two-fold stir casting procedure to yield hybrid composites witha Mg-0.5 wt% CNT/h-BN.2.1 Materials In Lagos State, Nigeria, an electrical rm produced magnesium ingots with 99.99% purity as a matrix.
Rice husks were obtainedin Ebonyi State, Nigeria; the nanoshell h-BN, with an averageparticle size of 70 –80 nm and a purity of 99%, was obtained in JoelChem, Nigeria. 2.2 Method 2.2.1 Production of CNTS from rice husks.Researchers developed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with a thickness of 15 nmusing rice husk.The solvent self-ignition temperature methodconverts rice husk (RH), a paddy residue, into carbon nanotubes (CNTs).The rice husks (RH) were washed, cleaned with deion- ized water, and dried for eight hours at 100 °C.A er being reduced to a ne powder, the dry RH was sieved to a 65 mm particle size.Ethanol was used to dissolve the catalyst, ferro-cene, and the dry RH.The mixture was covered with analuminium sheet.The samples were placed in the quartz tube'score and heated using a Samsung microwave oven model M539MAN200405W, which has a 700 W power output and operates at 2.55 GHz.
The produced carbon nanotubes were sonicated for two hours in a water bath a er being suspended in 60 millilitres of concentrated HNO 3and H 2SO4solution in a 3 : 1 ratio. A er that, the re ned CNTs were rinsed many times with distilled water and let to dry at 110 °C for 24 hours.28,29 2.2.2 Surface modi cation of h-BN and CNTs.The surface particles of h-BN and CNTs were coated using the electrolessprocess to improve the bonding between the matrix and the reinforcements.The two primary procedures in the electroless nano-Ag coating technique that were used to deposit nano-Agon the surfaces of either h-BN or CNTs were sensitization andnano-Ag deposition.The h-BN and CNTs are immersed in a 10%sodium hydroxide solution and vigorously agitated for onehour, a er which they are immersed in acetone for an addi- tional hour to enhance their surface sensitivity and e ﬀectively remove any surface contaminants.
Following that, distilled water was used to wash the h-BN and CNTs a er they had been ltered and dried in electric furnace at 110 °C for an hour. The bath's solution, which included 300 mL L −1of formal- dehyde and 3 g L−1of silver nitrate, was adjusted to a pH of 12 using ammonia.As soon as formaldehyde was introduced, the © 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry RSC Adv.,2 0 2 4 , 14,2 4 1 5 2 –24164 | 24153Paper RSC Advances reaction began.A er 10 minutes of room temperature magnetic spinning, the solution containing h-BN and CNTs was sus- pended.The electroless process was successfully nished in less than half an hour.A erltering, acetone was used to clean the mixture.A er that, it was vacuum-dried at 110 °C for an hour.27 The electroless chemical deposition technique coats h-BN or CNTs with 30 percent Ni.
To nish this procedure, the predicted amounts needed are 80 gL−1potassium sodium tartrate, 100 gL−1nickel chloride, 50 gL−1ammonium chloride, and 100 gL−1sodium hypophosphite. A temperature of around 100 degrees Celsius and a pH of approximately 9.2 are established.The liquid is then combined with di ﬀerent amounts of ceramic powder.11 2.2.3 Mg-CNT/h-BN composite nanoparticles manufacturing.To develop the Mg-CNTs/h-BN hybrid nano- composite, the double stir casting technique described belowwas used.The bottom of the graphite crucible was lled with 0.5 wt% CNTs with varying weight percentages of xh-BN ( x=0, 2, 4, and 6 wt%).The projected weight of the magnesium ingotwas then charged, heated to 750 degrees Celsius, and steepedfor 30 minutes in an argon atmosphere.Once the molten metalhad fully melted, degassing tablets (hexachloroethane) wereused to reduce porosity.
To stir the molten metal twice ata speed of 250 rpm, a stainless steel-coated graphite stirrer wasemployed, and it was lowered progressively into the melt. The material was then put into a mould that had been heated to 500 °C for 30 minutes in order to achieve uniform solidi cation.The sample was machined a er casting in order to determine its mechanical and physical properties.2.2.4 Characteristics of Mg-CNTs/h-BN hybrid nano composites.The density of the sintered hybrid composite samples was calculated using the Archimedes principle incompliance with MPIF Standard 42, 1998.Both air and distilled water were used for measurements prior to determining the samples' densities.The samples' morphological compositionwas examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).Toprepare the hybrid composite samples for microstructureexamination, they were rst ground using ne-grit paper and then polished with alumina paste.
X-ray di ﬀraction (XRD) analysis with Cu k radiation ( l=0.15406 nm) was used to look into the structure of the phases in the samples. The polished hybrid composite samples in the United States underwent a Vickers hardness instrument test.For every sample, the meanofve readings was selected at random.A dwell time of 15 seconds and an applied load of 300 g of hardness were used.Electrochemical experiments utilising the model CHI660Delectrochemical (CH Instrument, USA) equipment were used todetermine the corrosion behaviour.A standard three-electrodeelectrochemical cell was used for the studies.The surface area of the specimen, measured in centimeters, served as the working electrode, while platinum (Pt) served as the counterelectrode and AgCl model C2015B1-5 (China) served as thereference electrode.The electrodes were immersed in simulatedsaltwater in a 250 mL beaker.
For 3600 seconds —the amount of time required for the open circuit potential (OCP) to approacha quasi-stationary state —the OCP data was determined. A scan rate of 0.5 mV s −1was used to assess polarisation.A 10 mVsmall-amplitude AC pulse, ranging in frequency from 0.1 Hz to 0.5 MHz, impressed the EIS.The electrochemical parameters, such as the corrosion potential ( Ecorr), corrosion current density (icorr), and corrosion rate, were computed using Tafel plots.The impedance data was then examined using Nyquist plots.Anal-ysis was done on the parameters derived from the best similarcircuit.Eqn (1) was used to calculate the polarisationresistance.18 Rp¼babc 2:3icorrðbaþbcÞ(1) where; anodic constant =ba,current density =icorr, cathodic constant =bc 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Al-CNTs/h-BNH hybrid composite density The density of casted Mg-CNT-based hybrid composites was calculated using Archimedes' principle, and the theoretical density was estimated using the role of the mixture.Fig.
1displays the relative density of the Mg-0.5 wt% CNT hybridnanocomposites reinforced with di ﬀerent weight percent h-BN ratios of 0, 2, 4, and 6. It shows a consistent increase indensity as the h-BN ratio increases.The greater densities of h-BN and Mg, at 2.1 and 1.78 g cm −3, respectively, may be attributed.Additionally, the great it's also important that the CNTs and h-BN are spread out evenly in the magnesium matrix.This is possible because the nano-Ag and Ni coatings on surfacekeep them almost 99.5% of the casted Mg matrix densi ed.This is in consistent with the work of ref.30.3.2 Microstructure Fig.2 and 3 displays the samples' microstructures at various h- BN levels.Fig.2 and 3 show that the Mg granules are unevenlydistributed, speci cally, when compared to one another, the grains on the le side of the surface are bigger than the ones on the right.Furthermore, it is evident that the distribution ofgrains varies along the surface.
With the addition of h-BN at a 2% level, the microstructure somewhat improved. This is due to the h-BN addition, which reduced the particle size relative tothe unreinforced sample and almost uniformized the particle Fig.1 Variation of density with wt% h-BN content.24154 |RSC Adv.,2 0 2 4 , 14,2 4 1 5 2 –24164 © 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of ChemistryRSC Advances Paper distribution.It is notable that the h-BN addition prevented the grains from becoming larger and helped to coordinate and organize them.An important nding is the uneven distribution of Ag and Ni grains among the Mg and h-BN grains which isvisible as white phases in the microstructure.The distributionof Mg particles at 4% h-BN was more uniform when the particlesize decreased; compared to 2% h-BN.Ag and Ni grains areemerging in addition to the Mg and CNT nanoparticles.Notably, despite the absence of pores in the section with 2% h-BN, a few of them appeared on the surface in a dense way.Fig.
2 shows that as the percentage of h-BN increases to 4%, the size and distribution of the grains become smaller and moreuniform compared to their previous proportion. Furthermore,we see that at a percentage of 4% h-BN, the best plasticformation and dynamic recrystallization are clearly visible.Twomain factors were responsible for this observation: 1.h-BNreduced the number of microscopic holes by making it easierfor the granules to slide over one another.2.The addition of Ag and Ni coatings reduces internal holes and enhances granule adhesion, 30as the h-BN percentage increases to 4%, Fig.3illustrates how plastic formation and dynamic recrystallization occur, producing small grains and regularity in the particles.There were even amounts of nickel and silver grains on and between the carbon nanotube, h-BN, and magnesium, whichmade the size and pores smaller.Fig.
2 and 3 show that whenthe wt% h-BN goes up to 6, there is less wettability, which makesmore porosity or voids by making it harder for particles to packtogether and move around. The reason for this was that thethickness of the molten metal prevented the CNTs and h-BN's inthe Mg matrix from becoming improperly wettable.In the work of, 31,32the stir casting method yielded similar results.3.3 Phase analysis by XRD Fig.4 displays an X-ray di ﬀraction (XRD) study of a magnesium- 0.5 wt% carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposite.It wasevidence that at 45 and 61°, in all these samples, this corre- sponded to a-Mg and CNTs phases.However, there is an absence of h-BN phases in the XRD spectrum of 0 wt% h-BN.The presence of h-BN phases was obtained in the compositesof 2, 4, and 6 wt% h-BN at 73 and 80°, respectively.No chemical Fig.2 The SEM images of the casted Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/h-BN nanohybrid composites reinforced with the 0, 4 and 6 wt% of nano h-BN.© 2024 The Author(s).

The Mg-0.5 wt%CNTs samples containing h-BN exhibited higher noble poten-tial values compared to the Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs. This di ﬀerencecan be attributed to h-BN acting as a protective mechanism against corrosion of the Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs.As a result of thisevent, OCP values shi , moving towards a nobler state.This is especially noticeable in the Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs-4% h-BN sample,which suggests improved protective qualities.Moreover, weobserved the impact of h-BN concentration on the OCP of the Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs over the 3600 seconds immersion time, and the OCP remained constant, indicating the achievement ofa steady-state potential.However, we observed OCP variationsin other samples during the 3600 seconds time period, sug-gesting the potential for stabilisation through further testing.3.4.2 Tafel curves for potentiodynamic polarisation.
Tafel measurements, or linear potentiodynamic polarisation, wereused to examine the protective qualities of casted Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/h-BN nanohybrid composites reinforced with 0, 2, 4, and 6 wt% of nano h-BN in a 3.5% NaCl solution. Fig.6 and Table 1display key polarisation characteristics such as the corrosionpotential ( E corr), the corrosion rate (CR), and the current density (icorr).Tafel graphs showing the corrosion behaviour of casted Fig.3 The TEM images of the casted Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/h-BN nanohybrid composites reinforced with the 0, 4 and 6 wt% of nano h-BN.24156 |RSC Adv.,2 0 2 4 , 14,2 4 1 5 2 –24164 © 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of ChemistryRSC Advances Paper Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/h-BN nanohybrid composites reinforced with 0, 2, 4, and 6 wt% of nano h-BN composite are shown in Fig.6.This method made it easier to evaluate how well various h-BN lms protected against corrosion.Signi cantly, as Fig.
6 shows, the polarisation curves of the with-h-BN and without-h-BN samples showed clear variances, indicating di ﬀerent corro- sion behaviours among the materials examined. When compared to the Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/0% h-BN, the corrosion resistance of the samples h-BN signi cantly improved, as shown by a shi in corrosion potential ( E corr) towards a more noble positive potential and a decrease in corrosion current ( icorr).This enhancement is usually ascribed to the protective function of the h-BN, which shields the samplesurface and encourages a positive shi inEcorrand icorr.This protective mechanism in composite coatings is linked to barrierand passivation e ﬀects.The correlation between corrosion resistance and potential underscores the importance of corro-sion current density in determining the corrosion rate.Inter-estingly, the sample with 4% h-BN showed increased resistanceto corrosion.
The Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/0 wt% h-BN sample showedthe greatest values for corrosion rate (CR), corrosion current density ( i corr), and low polarisation resistance ( Rp), Fig. 4 The XRD analysis of the casted Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/h-BN nanohybrid composites reinforced with the 0, 2, 4, and 6 wt% of nano h-BN.Fig.5 OCP curves of the casted Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/h-BN nanohybrid composites reinforced with the 0, 2, 4, and 6 wt% of nano h-BN.Fig.6 Tafel curves of the casted Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/h-BN nanohybrid composites reinforced with the 0, 2, 4, and 6 wt% of nano h-BN.© 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry RSC Adv.,2 0 2 4 , 14,2 4 1 5 2 –24164 | 24157Paper RSC Advances demonstrating its lower corrosion resistance in the corrosive medium (3.5% NaCl) (Table 1).The Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs with h-BN, on the other hand, greatly increased Rpwhile decreasing CR and icorr.This shows that the h-BN particles are e ﬀectively blocking the entry of chloride ions.
Reductions in CR and icorrreadings indicate that the 4% h-BN sample performed better than the 0% h-BN. This betterperformance is believed to be due to increased adhesivestrength, potentially preventing gaps or holes from forming inthe sample.In addition, it's possible that the inclusion of 4% h-BN in the matrix minimised their sizes and boundaries andstopped micro-voids in samples, all of which improved corro-sion resistance.On the other hand, a higher concentration of 6% h-BN would encourage the development of bigger grain boundaries, providing more channels for the penetration ofchloride ions and raising the values of CR and i corr.Further- more, compared to ndings obtained without h-BN, the inclu- sion of h-BN lowers passivation current and oxide monomercurrent density, suggesting the production of a less conductivecomposite with enhanced protective qualities.
19 Lower corrosion current and higher maximum polarisation resistance are the results of adding h-BN, which suggests improved protective qualities.27It is well known that barrier eﬀects and electrochemical protection are the two main components that enhance corrosion resistance in composites.Electrochemical protection mechanisms, stated di ﬀerently, justify the establishment of a passive layer on the samplesurface and the increase in corrosion potential. This results ina reduction of the corrosion current density and, therefore, a percentage drop in the composite's corrosion rate.Fig.6 illustrates how the Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/0% h-BN composite's corrosion potential shi ed towards the anodic region in contrast to the addition of h-BN.It was evidence thatthe dispersion degree of CNTs in the matrix, the cathodicproperties of CNTs, and the galvanic couplings between the Mgand CNTs are the factors that a ﬀect the corrosion resistance of Mg/0.5 wt% CNTs composites.
The addition of h-BN formed during the creation of magnesium matrix composites rein- forced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and potential variationsare signi cant factors in uencing the corrosion resistance of these materials. Combining h-BN with magnesium hydroxide inaa-phase composite undergoing corrosion results in the production of a passive layer with a sizable surface area.Thischaracteristic stops chloride ions from piercing samplesurfaces, slowing down the pace of corrosion.However, the oxide layer that turned into metal chloride is broken down bythe presence of chlorine ions.This causes magnesium (OH) 2to convert into magnesium chloride, which accelerates in the Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/0% h-BN composites.33–35 3.4.3 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).EIS was used to con rm how well the composites under investiga- tion prevented corrosion when immersed in a 3.5% NaCl solu- tion.
The EIS spectra of the Nyquist and Bode plots of the castMg-0.5 wt% CNTs/h-BN nanohybrid composites that werestrengthened with 0, 2, 4, and 6% wt% nano h-BN samples canbe seen in Fig. 7.The corrosion process's charge transfer isexplained by the single capacitive loop shown in the Nyquistplots.The diameter of the loops grows as the wt% h-BN rises 4.The diameter of the circle increases much more with the addition of h-BN, suggesting that the increased electrode surface covering by h-BN is the cause of the compositeincreased resistance.36This suggests that the impedance of the composite rises.It was observed that the semicircle diameter ofthe sample with h-BN is larger than the sample without h-BN.Higher corrosion resistance is o en indicated by a sample with a bigger semicircle diameter or more impressive persis-tence of charge transfer.
13The decrease in corrosion rate seen when charge transfer resistance increases are thought to be caused by the corrosion products generated at the samplesurface. 24,34 As the percentage of h-BN increased to 4, the overall impedance arc diameter increased signi cantly in the sample.The sample with 4% h-BN had the largest capacitive arc width,which meant it was the best at protecting against corrosion.Comparing the sample without h-BN addition makes this clear.The corrosion enhancement of the h-BN was attributed to the formation of a barrier between the corrosive electrolyte and thesample surface; the resultant oxide layer passively increased thematerials' resistance to corrosion.There is an obvious semi-circle loop showing the formation of an oxide layer; a bigger radius of the semi-circle indicatesa more powerful protection e ﬃcacy of the passive layer that is created.Likewise, peel-o ﬀin the passive layer may be inferred by the inductance loop.Fig.
8 illustrates how the impedance plots are tted using an analogous circuit with a single time constant. Solution resistance ( R s) and double layer capacitance ( Cdl), which are connected in parallel to the charge transfer resistance(R ct), are components of the analogous circuit.Since the metal/ solution contact does not equate to an ideal capacitor, CPE isswapped by double layer capacitance, C dl, to get a more accurateTable 1 Tafel and EIS results of the casted Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/h-BN nanohybrid composites reinforced with the 0, 2, 4, and 6 wt% of nano h-BN h-BN (wt%)icorr (A cm−2)Ecorr (V)Polarisation resistance ( U)Corrosion rate (MPY)Rct (Ucm2)Cpdl (mFc m−2)×10−4CPE× 10−4U−1sncm−2X2×10−4 0 3.57 ×10−3−0.37 35 17.07 8.24 1000.13 5.6 3 2 1.94 ×10−3−0.29 101 9.68 9.46 701.38 3.4 2 4 3.10 ×10−4−0.19 145 3.35 11.00 473.45 2.1 1 6 1.71 ×10−3−0.27 108 8.71 9.80 688.65 3.2 2 24158 |RSC Adv.,2 0 2 4 , 14,2 4 1 5 2 –24164 © 2024 The Author(s).

While the Bode phase angle diagram shows a more negative value of thephase angle at high frequency with increasing wt% h-BN, theBode modulus diagram shows an increase in the impedancemodulus over the whole frequency range. The resistance to thetransfer of charge ( R ct) value, also known as the barrier that the passive layer o ﬀers for the transport of charge, may be used to assess the e ﬃcacy of the passive layer in this situation.37,38 Greater Rctvalues suggest that more excellent corrosion resis- tance is attained by decreased ion movement in the passivelayer during the deterioration operation.As shown in Fig.8a,the 0% h-BN composite has smaller semi-conductive loops than the h-BN samples, which may indicate that the h-BN has better passive layer-created obstacle e ﬃciency.The chi-square ( x 2) values were used to verify that the equivalent circuit tted to the specication.

There were several pits encircled, indicating that pit formation continued throughout the exposure time and accu- mulated on the surface (Fig. 9a).The Mg-0.5 wt% CNT sampleproduced the greatest number of corrosion sites, which may beattributed to microgalvanic activity between the cathodic CNTsand the anodic Mg matrix.The h-BN material's degradedsurface showed that the h-BN ingredients had successfullys t u c kt ot h es u r f a c et of e n da g a i n s tc o r r o s i o na t t a c k .T h esamples were encased in h-BN, which formed a passive corrosion barrier.The h-BN composite samples' hard phases provided protection against corrosive action by reducing thea m o u n ta n dk i n do fs u r f a c ed a m a g e .T h eM g - 0 .5w t %C N T s /4% h-BN specimens, in particular, showed very little overalldamage, highlighting the function of h-BN in preventing sample degradation.Furthermore, the e ﬃcient dispersion of h-BN hindered the corrosion process.
This helped to close thepores and limit the paths that electrolytes and corrosive ionsmight take. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in contact mode was used to further assess the corrosion surface roughness.Fig.10 displaystypical AFM pictures of the corroded surface, the ndings demonstrated that the sample of 4 wt% h-BN had higher average surface roughness values, which suggests the existence of passive lms and corrosion product.For example, mean roughness values of 1.7, 2.4, 5.2 and 3.5 nm were obtained at 0,2, 4 and 6 wt% h-BN, respectively.The ndings support earlier research of, 40–43which showed that surface roughness rose with the formation of passive lms.The reason why 4 wt% h-BN sample with a greater level of roughness is considered supe-rior for corrosion resistance of the samples.Fig.9 SEM Corroded surface of casted Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/h-BN nanohybrid composites reinforced with the (a) 0, (b) 2, (c) 4, and (d) 6 wt% of nano h-BN.24160 |RSC Adv.

Toimprove the wettability and dispersion between the reinforce- ment and matrix, it must overcome a number of obstacles, such as: (i) rising temperatures; (ii) high pressure; and (iii) corrosionrates. Consequently, we use the double stir casting process tomix di ﬀerent quantities of BN (2, 4, and 6 weight percent).Numerous microstructure, physical, and corrosion studies wereconducted to look into the innovative features and attributes.The conclusions drawn from the observations and informationgathered in this research may be summed up as follows: (1) Coated h-BN nanoparticles were successfully and uniformly distributed throughout the magnesium matrix, up toa 4 weight percent concentration.However, upon increasing theh-BN level to 6 weight percent, observable particle agglomera-tion occurred.(2) The e ﬀective dispersion of h-BN and CNTs throughout the matrix may lead to synergistic processes that improvecorrosion resistance.
(3) At a 4 weight percent h-BN concentration, we found corrosion protection of 75.1%. A well-balanced dispersion of h-BN inside the Mg matrix cultivates improved interfacialconnections and structural resilience, resulting in optimalcorrosion.This concentration signi cantly reduces the poten- tial negative impacts of excessive h-BN agglomeration andporosity, which leads to the highest corrosion resistance.(4) The Mg-0.5 wt% CNTs/4 wt% h-BN nanocomposite had amazing and unique properties that showed how well this new method improved the material's resistance to corrosion andlowered the microgalvanic e ﬀect of the Mg and CNTs.Data availability The author con rm that the data supporting this study's conclusions is included in the publication.
