Because homocysteine (Hcy) metabolic imbalance is considered a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, we investigated whether maternal Vitamin B deficiency during early development alters the offspring’s methionine-homocysteine metabolism in their brain. To this end,the dams were submitted to experimental diet one month before and during pregnancy or pregnancy/lactation.After birth, the offspring were organized into the following groups: control (CT), deficient diet during pregnancy and lactation (DPL) and deficient diet during pregnancy (DP).The mice were euthanized at various stages of development.Hcy, cysteine,glutathione (GSH), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), folate and cobalamin concentrations weremeasured in the plasma and/or brain.At postnatal day (PND) 0, total brain of female and male offspring exhibited decreased SAM/SAH ratios.Moreover, at PND 28, we observed decreased GSH/GSSG ratios in both females and males in the DPL group.
Exposure to a Vitamin B-deficient diet during the ontogenic plasticity period had a negative impact on plasma folateand brain cortex SAM concentrations in aged DPL males. We also observed decreased plasma GSH concentrations in bothDP and DPL males (PND 210).Additionally, this manipulation seemed to affect the female and male offspring differently.The decreased plasma GSH concentration may reflect redox changes in tissues and the decreased brain cortex SAM may be involved in changes of gene expression, which could contribute to neurodegenerative diseases over the long term.Citation: Silva VCd, Fernandes L, Haseyama EJ, Agamme ALDA, Shinohara EMG, et al.(2014) Effect of Vitamin B Deprivation during Pregnancy and Lactation on Homocysteine Metabolism and Related Metabolites in Brain and Plasma of Mice Offspring.PLoS ONE 9(4): e92683.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092683 Editor: Shawn E.

First, the methionineadenosyltransferase enzyme produces an intermediate metabolitecalled S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which has an important biological function as methyl donor in a multitude of cellular methylation reactions [3]. After the transmethylation reaction bythe action of specific methyltransferases, SAM is converted into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).Interestingly, SAH is an inhibitor ofSAM-dependent methyltransferases activity, and the ratio SAM/SAH is used as an index of cellular methylation potential.SAH isthen hydrolyzed to adenosine and Hcy by the enzyme SAHhydrolase [4].In fact, the reaction catalyzed by SAH hydrolase isreversible, and thermodynamics favors AdoHcy (also named SAH)synthesis rather that Hcy production.So, when Hcy accumulates,SAH will accumulate as well.However, under normal conditionsHcy will be quickly metabolized and the reaction proceeds in thedirect way.
The Hcy may be then remethylated to methionine bythe ubiquitously distributed methionine synthase (MS), or bybetaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) in the liver and kidney of some species. MS utilizes 5-methyltetrahydrofolate andcobalamin as its methyl donor and cofactor, respectively, whereasBHMT employs betaine, which is produced during cholineoxidation as well as being provided by the diet [5].Additionally,Hcy can be catabolized through its transsulfuration, through aseries of reactions that end with the production of cysteine, whichmay be further used in glutathione (GSH) production.Accord-ingly, increasing evidence supports the importance of thetranssulfuration pathway of Hcy in the maintenance of the redoxhomeostasis [6].Hcy levels can vary considerably among individuals depending on genetic, dietary and environmental factors, and elevatedplasma concentrations have been identified as a risk factor forneurodegenerative diseases [7,8].
The disturbance of maternal andfetal Hcy metabolism attributable to folate or cobalamin shortagehas been shown to play a role in the etiology of recurrent earlypregnancy loss, placental abruption and preeclampsia [9–11]. Inprogeny, hyperhomocysteinemia (hHCY) effects have been PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92683 associated with premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation, neural tube defects and fetal death [12,13].Evidence from observational and experimental studies suggests a link between adverse exposures in early life, particularly relatingto nutrition status (restriction or supplement), and chronic diseasesusceptibility in adulthood.For example, studies in rats have found that maternal gestational diabetes exposure in the fetal or neonatal period can result in permanent changes in body fat mass and inthe hypothalamic neuronal circuitry regulating appetite in theadult brain [14,15].
According to the developmental origin ofhealth and disease hypothesis, increased susceptibility to disease ispartly shaped during fetal programming by the interaction ofnutrition and epigenetic mechanisms [16]. Cobalamin and folate deficiency in pregnancy is relatively common, especially in some countries of sub-Saharan Africa,northern Europe and Brazil [17–20].A study on rats with hHcy during pregnancy indicated that maternal folate status alters the homeostasis of one-carbon metabolism and the methyl pool, whichwould in part affect placental DNA methylation [21].Interesting-ly, gestational Vitamin B deficiency leads to an accumulation ofHcy with concomitant apoptosis in select brain areas and altersneurobehavioral capacities during rat development [22].Further-more, maternal chronic hHcy can impair brain development and,consequently, the cognitive functions of the fetus by increasingneuronal vulnerability to excitotoxicity and oxidative stress[23,24].
In humans, low maternal folate status during earlypregnancy was associated with a higher risk of emotional problemsin the offspring, such as anxiety and depression, behavioralwithdrawn symptoms and somatic complaints [25]. Despite thesestudies, little is known about the effects of vitamin B deficiency infetuses and neonates on their methionine-homocysteine metabo-lism programming and subsequent consequences to the brain.Considering that exposure to suboptimal nutrition during earlydevelopment leads to a long-term, age-dependent metabolic response [26], we investigated the effects of a vitamin B-deficient diet during pregnancy or pregnancy/lactation in mice offspring.To this end, we quantified Hcy, cysteine (Cys), GSH, SAM, SAHconcentrations and folate and cobalamin cofactors in plasma and/or brain on postnatal day (PND) 0, 5, 28, 90 and 210.
Results Dams The dams that received the deficient diet (DDD) had, after 20 days, approximately a 50% increase in plasma Hcy concentrations(13.606 mmol/L) compared to control group (CT) (9.219 mmol/L), P,0.001 (Figure 1). Offspring After birth, the offspring were separated into three groups: control (CT), deficient diet during pregnancy and lactation (DPL)and deficient diet during pregnancy (DP).The dams of offspringCT and DPL received, respectively, standard and deficient dietduring pregnancy and lactation, and the DP offspring wasbreastfed by control dams that received the standard diet during lactation.To evaluate the effect of Vitamin B deficiency during pregnancy on brain methyl metabolism in the offspring, SAM and SAH weremeasured after birth (PND 0) in the DP and CT groups.
The braintissue of female offspring exposed to the deficient diet exhibited,when compared to CT, increased concentration of SAH(P= 0.014) but no significant difference in SAM concentration (P= 0.140; Figure 2). Interestingly, the brain analysis of male offspring did not show changes in SAH concentration ( P= 0.620)but did exhibit a decrease in SAM concentration ( P= 0.028, Figure 3).However, both females ( P,0.001) and males ( P= 0.033) exhibited a decrease in SAM/SAH brain ratios.The concentra-tions of total GSH ( P= 0.372 and P= 0.841), reduced GSH (P= 0.592 and P= 0.805), GSSG ( P= 0.148 and P= 0.654) and GSH/GSSG ratios ( P= 0.185 and P= 0.699) were not significant- ly different in total brain of females and males, respectively(Table 1).In this period, the plasma analyses were not performedbecause of insufficient material.
However, at PND 5 plasma Hcy was quantified and an increase in both female ( P= 0.001) and male (P= 0.013) DPL was observed when compared to the CT group (Figure 4). Results concerning plasma dosage at PND 28 are summarized in Table 2.When the effects of a deficient diet in PND 28(weaning) were evaluated, a significant increase in plasma Hcyconcentration was observed in the female DPL group whencompared to the DP ( P,0.001) and CT ( P,0.001) groups.This increase was approximately four times higher than in PND 5, in both female and male offspring.Moreover, the DPL group had adecrease in plasma folate and cobalamin concentrations whencompared to the DP ( P,0.001 and P= 0.019) and CT ( P= 0.001 and P= 0.013) groups, respectively.However, there were no changes in plasma Cys ( P= 0.184) and total GSH ( P= 0.590) Figure 1.Plasma Hcy concentration in dams after twenty days on an experimental diet.n = 6–8; PND = Postnatal day; CT = control; DDD = dams in deficient diet.t test .

There was also a decrease in cobalamin concentration when comparing the DPL to CT ( P,0.008) group. No changes were observed in plasma Cys ( P= 0.418) and total GSH (P= 0.911) concentrations in males.To investigate whether a maternal Vitamin B-deficient diet during breast-feeding could affect methyl metabolism in the offspring’s brain cortex, we quantified SAM and SAH concentra- tions at PND 28.The concentrations of brain cortex SAM, SAH and SAM/SAH ratio did not change in either female ( P= 0.075, P= 0.0706 and P= 0.588, respectively) and male ( P= 0.930, P= 0.469 and P= 0.565, respectively) offspring.However, de- creases in total GSH, reduced GSH, and GSH/GSSG ratio were observed in the brain cortex of males in the DPL group when compared to the DP ( P= 0.047, P= 0.013 and P= 0.028, respectively) and CT ( P= 0.002, P= 0.009 and P= 0.049, respec- tively) groups.No significant difference in GSSG concentration was observed between groups ( P= 0.200).
In females, an increase of total GSH and reduced GSH was observed in the DP group when compared to the DPL (P = 0.003 and P,0.001) and CT (P= 0.033 and P= 0.014) groups, respectively. Alternatively, the GSH/GSSG ratio showed a significant decrease in the DPL group when compared to the DP ( P,0.001) and CT ( P= 0.027) groups.No change was observed in GSSG ( P= 0.396) concentration in females.Considering genders, a statistically significant difference in total GSH concentration was observed between females and males in PND 28 offspring from the control group ( P,0.001) (Table 2).Exposure to a deficient diet during early development influenced the methyl pool, Hcy and GSH metabolism.Therefore, we investigated whether these changes persisted after weaning and exposition to a standard diet.Female offspring were analyzed at PND 90, and no changes were observed in plasma Hcy (P= 0.671), Cys ( P= 0.409), total GSH ( P= 0.451), folate (P= 0.648) or cobalamin ( P= 0.102).
As for the brain cortex, there were also no significant differences in SAM (P = 0.712), SAH (P= 0.773), SAM/SAH ratio ( P= 0.620), total GSH ( P= 0.430), reduced GSH ( P= 0.996), GSSG ( P= 0.061) or GSH/GSSG ratio (P= 0.290). In males, there were no significant differences in plasma Hcy ( P= 0.084), Cys ( P= 0.769), total GSH ( P= 0.193),folate ( P= 0.071) or cobalamin ( P= 0.501).For the brain cortex, the levels of SAM (P = 0.684), SAH (P = 0.845), SAM/SAH ratio (P = 0.683), total GSH (P = 0.220), reduced GSH (P = 0.154), GSSG (P = 0.508) and GSH/GSSG ratio (P = 0.235) were not altered (Table 3).Considering that aging is associated with the occurrence of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases and that these condi- tions can be linked to maternal nutrition during pregnancy, we analyzed offspring at PND 210.The female offspring showed no differences in plasma Hcy ( P= 0.146), Cys ( P= 0.699), total GSH (P= 0.807), folate ( P= 0.515) or in cobalamin ( P= 0.240).
The brain cortex concentration of SAM ( P= 0.837), SAH ( P= 0.711) and SAM/SAH ratio ( P= 0.902) also remained unchanged. There were also no changes in brain cortex concentrations of total GSH (P= 0.980), reduced GSH ( P= 0.682), GSSG ( P= 0.380) or GSH/ GSSG ratio ( P= 0.374).In male offspring at PND 210, there were decreases in plasma folate and brain cortex SAM concentrations in the DPL group when compared to the DP ( P= 0.014 and P= 0.012) and CT ( P= 0.019 and P= 0.006) groups, respectively.Moreover, there was a decrease in plasma GSH concentration in both the DPL ( P= 0.026) and DP ( P= 0.026) groups when compared to the CT group.No differences were observed in the brain cortex concentration of SAH ( P= 0.283), SAM/SAH ratio (P= 0.863), total GSH ( P= 0.905), reduced GSH ( P= 0.779), GSSG ( P= 0.870) and GSH/GSSG ratio ( P= 0.880), or the plasma concentrations of Hcy ( P= 0.662), Cys ( P= 0.873) and cobalamin ( P= 0.841).
The plasma Hcy of males at PND 210 were positively correlated ( P,0.05) with brain cortex levels of SAM and SAH ( r= 0.92 and r= 0.96, respectively). A positive correlation was also observed between plasma Hcy and brain cortex total GSH concentrations ( r= 1.00, P,0.05).However, a negative correlation was observed between plasma GSH and brain cortextotal GSH concentration ( r= 0.48, P,0.05).Regarding the plasma Hcy concentration, a statistically significant difference was observed between genders in PND 210 offspring ( P,0.001).Still considering metabolites related to Hcy metabolism, plasma GSH differences can also be observed in these animals ( P,0.001, Table 4).Discussion The placenta is the interface between fetal and maternal circulation and plays a critical role in the regulation of fetal growthand development through controlled nutrient supply.In this Figure 3.

These include the DNA methyl-transferases.In fact, increased Hcy and SAH levels, decreasedSAM/SAH ratios and global DNA hypomethylation werereported in healthy humans [28].Data published by Kim et al.[21] indicated that a folate-deficient diet supplemented by Hcydecreased SAM concentration and SAM/SAH ratio in both theplacenta and the liver of pregnant rats, and these changes werelinked to the decrease in DNA methylation.
In humans, a recentstudy reported that increased Hcy concentration changes placental global methylation levels in women with pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and preterm delivery [29]. The observedabnormal global DNA methylation might reflect changes innormal temporal regulation of gene expression that is crucial forthe optimal development of the fetus and may have implicationsfor many metabolic processes.In our study, we observed that asimilar diet manipulation also alters methyl metabolism innewborn brains.Decreases in SAM concentration and SAM/ SAH ratio in the total brain of male offspring were observed.Infemales, we also observed a decrease in SAM/SAH ratio;however, this change was due to an increase in SAH concentrationinstead of a reduction of SAM concentration, as seen in the males.These results show that, although male and female newbornsexhibited a decrease in SAM/SAH ratio, there is a crucialdifference in the maternal-fetal interaction between genders.
Astudy published by Guerra-Shinohara et al. [30] showed that, in humans, low maternal concentrations of cobalamin and folate andelevated plasma Hcy concentrations were associated with adecrease in the plasma SAM/SAH ratio in newborns; however,the gender specificity of this difference was not analyzed.Ourfindings showing gender differences in mice indicate the need for further studies to conclude whether these differences in the concentrations of SAM and SAH, among young males andfemales (CT and DP groups), are due to a differential redirectionof methionine or vitamins by mothers or to differential response ofthe fetus (male or female) to vitamin deficiency.A pioneering study published by Barker and Osmond (1986) showed a relation between nutrition and growth before birth andTable 1.Effects of a Vitamin B-deficient diet during pregnancy on total GSH, reduced GSH and GSSG concentrations, and GSH/ GSSG ratios in the brain of offspring at PND 0.

GSH has a vital function in protecting tissues against thedegenerating effects of oxidative damage by scavenging free radicals from endogenous or exogenous agents [33,34], and theGSH/GSSG ratio is considered to be a sensitive indicator of thecellular redox state [35]. With this fact in mind, in our study, thehigh Hcy concentration in maternal-fetal circulation could lead tooxidative stress and, as a consequence, a decreased efficacy ofdefense mechanisms such as GSH availability.Additionally, totalGSH concentration could increase as a result of maternalprogramming by epigenetic response to high plasma Hcy andpoor remethylation.In newborns (DP) from deficient diet dams,we observed no change in brain concentrations of total GSH andTable 3.Effects of a Vitamin B-deficient diet during pregnancy and pregnancy/lactation on plasma and brain cortex parameters in offspring at PND 90.

Data are presented as the mean 6 standard error.*Different from the CT group ( P#0.05).#Difference between DP and DPL groups ( P#0.05).t test ,1Difference between female and male control ( P#0.05).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092683.t004Effects of Gestational Vitamin B Deficiency PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92683 fractions (GSH and GSSG).Alternatively, increased plasma Hcy concentration seems to be associated with a decrease in total GSH and reduced GSH and thus a deficit in antioxidant capacity(GSH/GSSG ratio) in the brain cortex of DPL males at PND 28.In females, we observed the same decrease in antioxidant capacity in the DPL group when compared to the CT and DP groups.However, when total GSH and reduced GSH were analyzed, we observed an increase in the DP group compared to the CT and DPL groups.No significant differences in the concentrations ofSAM, SAH and SAM/SAH ratio were observed in females and males mice at PND 28.
However, Blaise et al. [22] has shown an increase in SAH concentration and decrease in SAM/SAH ratioin the brain of rat offspring submitted to a deficient diet during pregnancy and lactation.A study published by Jathar et al.[36] showed no change in cobalamin concentration in the breast milkof lacto-vegetarian mothers compared to non-vegetarians, even though a decrease in the serum cobalamin of lacto-vegetarians mothers have been reported.In our study, we did not analyze thebreast milk composition, but we observed an increase of approximately 120% in the plasma Hcy concentration of the offspring (PND 5) breastfed by dams fed the deficient diet.Moreover, there was a deficit in antioxidant capacities in the brain cortex of DPL offspring at PND 28.Additionally, a decrease in plasma folate and cobalamin was observed in the DPL offspring(PND 28) from dams fed the deficient diet during gestation and lactation.
In our study, we observed an increase in plasma folate concentration in DPL males (PND 90), but the difference did not reach statistical significance ( P= 0.071). A study performed in rats and published by Blaise et al.[22] showed an increase in plasma folate concentration in these animals at PND 80.Considering fetal development, the exposure to a diet deficient in methyl donor groups during pregnancy or pregnancy/lactationmay have caused a metabolic variation throughout life in response to the initial vitamin deficiency.Furthermore, the data showed that there is a difference in Hcy metabolism between females andmales, which is implied by the observed decrease in plasma Hcy concentrations throughout life in only males.An article published by Vitvitsky et al.[37] suggests that testosterone-mediated up- regulation of renal cystathionine- b-synthase levels in mice contributes to lower tHcy levels in males.
At older an age (PND 210), a decrease in plasma total GSH concentration was observedonly in females. This data corroborates with another study developed by Hirayama et al.[38] and can be directly related to decreased transsulfuration in females.Moreover, our data strengthen the evidence that there is a difference in the maternal-fetal interaction between males and females, as impliedby the different patterns of metabolic responses found during development.At PND 0, increased SAH and decreased SAM concentrations in the brain of DP offspring were observed infemales and males, respectively.DPL males at PND 210 showed a decrease in both plasma folate and brain cortex SAM concentra- tions.Additionally, there was also a decrease in plasma total GSHin both DP and DPL males.The plasma Hcy of males at PND 210 were positively correlated with brain cortex SAM, SAH and total GSH concentrations.
However, a negative correlation wasobserved between plasma GSH and brain cortex total GSH concentration. Other studies have also shown gender differences in response to maternal manipulation or environmental exposure (i.e., pollution) [39,40].Recent studies on epigenetic mechanisms show that males may be more likely to exhibit changes in adulthood than femalesdue to epigenetic marks that have occurred in the embryonic period [41].Furthermore, based on evolutionary theories, we cansay that the differences between genders in response to an ‘‘adverse environment’’ are the result of selective pressures withpotential benefits to females observed among mammals [42].Thepredominant agent in this case is the reproductive role of thefemale that involves the offspring’s care, an activity that requires a high consumption of energy, especially considering pregnancy and lactation [43,44].
However, in species where the male has agreater role in the care of offspring or if the insult is severe, thesedifferences are minimized [42,45]. In conclusion, a Vitamin B-deficient diet during pregnancy alters SAM and SAH metabolism in the brain of newborn mice.Moreover, this diet increases plasma Hcy and decreases theantioxidant capacities of the brain cortex in offspring breastfed bydams fed the deficient diet during lactation.Nutritional cobalamin deficiency due to maternal deficiency might be a serious health problem in infants; therefore, screening and supplementation ofpregnant and lactating women to prevent infantile cobalamindeficiency should be considered [46].The early exposition tomethyl group deficiency seems to impact female and maleoffspring differently.Moreover, these effects persist in the offspring in a long lasting manner; i.e., males at PND 210 showed a decrease in plasma folate, brain cortex SAM (DPL) and in plasmatotal GSH concentrations (DP and DPL).
Therefore, the decreasedplasma GSH concentration may reflect redox changes in tissues,and the imbalance in the availability of methyl groups may alterthe programming of genes involved in the etiology of age-related degenerative diseases. Materials and Methods Animal Treatment Protocols Animal experiments were performed on Swiss mice and conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use ofLaboratory Animals (8th edition, National Academy Press,Washington D.C., 2011) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Universidade Federal de Sa˜o Paulo ( #1169/08).Adult female mice were maintained under standard laboratory conditions, on a 12-hour light/dark cycle,with food and water available ad libitum .
One month before pregnancy, twenty-eight female mice were distributed into thefollowing groups (n = 14 per group): a) standard diet (AIN-93M) and, b) a diet deficient of vitamins B12 (2.37 mg/kg), B2 (0.938 mg/kg), folate (0.290 mg/kg), and choline (0.1736 mg/kg), (LabDiet, St. Louis, MO).Male mice were placed in thefemales’ home cages for mating and gestational day zero wasdetermined by confirming the presence of sperm in the content of vaginal smear.This vitamin B and choline deficient diet creates a significant methyl group deficit in the fetus.After birth, offspring were distributed into three groups: control (CT), deficient diet during pregnancy and lactation (DPL) and deficient diet during pregnancy (DP).The dams of offspring CT and DPL received, respectively, standard and deficient diet duringpregnancy and lactation.The dams of offspring DP receiveddeficient diet during pregnancy, but controls dams adopted thisoffspring during lactation (receiving standard diet).
To normalizethe effect of adopting suffered by the DP group, maternities were exchanged within each group, CT and DPL, and adjusted the litter for n = 8 animals per dams (n = 4, females; n = 4, males) in allgroups. All offspring groups were breastfed until PND 28 and afterweaning, all of them received a standard diet.Sample Collection Males and females were euthanized by decapitation at different developmental stages (PND 0, 5, 28, 90 or 210).The analysis onEffects of Gestational Vitamin B Deficiency PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92683 these time points allows us to infer the consequences of vitamin B and choline deficiency during pregnancy and pregnancy/lactation in the short term (PND 0, 5 and 28), and possible changes that arise or remain even after the introduction of the standard diet (post-weaning) can be observed in the medium and long term, PND 90 and 210, respectively.
Considering that gender differences were widely described in the literature for several parameters and also after manipulation during pregnancy and postnatal period, males and females were analyzed separately in this study. Blood was collected in tubes (Becton Dickinson, New England, UK) containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and stored on ice, and up to 90 minutes, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 uC.Plasma aliquots of all stages, except PND 0, were stored at 280uC for Hcy, Cys, GSH, folate and cobalamin measurements.The whole brain was collected, rapidly harvested and stored at 280uC for subsequent SAM, SAH, total GSH and reduced GSH measurements/quantification.Plasma measurements Plasma Hcy, Cys and total GSH were analyzed by high- performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) through fluorescence detection and isocratic elution.The method was developed by Pfeiffer et al.
[47] with slight modifications: column C18 Luna (5mm, 150 mm 64.6 mm), mobile phase (0.06 M sodium acetate, 0.5% acetic acid, pH 4.7 (adjusted with acetic acid), 2% methanol) and flow rate of 1.1 mL/min. The retention time was 3.6 minutes for Cys; 5.2 for Hcy and 9.0 for GSH [48].Plasma cobalamin concentration was determined by ELISA using the CUSABIO kit, and the plasma folate concentration was quantified by microbiological assay [49].Tissue measurements Total brain or total dissected cortex was homogenized in PBS using a tissue homogenator (T10 basic IKA, Staufen, Germany).For SAM and SAH measurements, the protein and debris were precipitated from total homogenate tissue with HClO 4andcentrifuged.The supernatant was injected into the column C18 LiChroCart (5 mm, 250 mm 64 mm).The mobile phase was applied at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and consisted of 50 mMsodium phosphate (pH 2.8), 10 mM heptan sulfonate, and 10%acetonitrile.The UV detector had a wavelength of 254 nm.
Theretention time was 8.7 minutes for SAH and 13.6 minutes forSAM, a technique adapted from Blaise et al.[50]. Total brain GSH measurements were performed using the same method previously described for measuring total plasma GSH.Forreduced GSH quantification, the reducing agent was not added, and the concentrations were calculated.Statistical Analyses Analyses of dams, offspring at PND 0 and PND 5, and females and males controls were performed using t test for independent groups.For the analysis of offspring at PND 28, PND 90 and PND210 we performed analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hocFisher’s test when necessary.For finding out significant relation between two variables, Pearson’s correlation was used.Data werepresented as the mean 6standard error.The level of significance was P#0.05.The program STATISTICA 8.0 was used to perform the analysis.
