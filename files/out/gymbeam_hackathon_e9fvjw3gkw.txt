Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the seventh most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second most frequent cause of tumor-related death.[1,2]According to statistics, about 841,080 newly diagnosed cases and 781,631 deaths occurred worldwide in 2018.[1,2]Among them, about 50% of newly diagnosed patients were occurred in China.[3]The main factors that cause HCC are hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection,excessive alcohol consumption, contact or consumption of Aspergillus toxins as well as various metabolic disorders. [4,5] Despite the improvement of diagnostic and treatment methods in recent years, the prognosis of HCC remains unsatisfactory.[6–8] More than half HCC patients already have advanced or metastatic lesions when diagnosed, due to the lack of noticeable clinicalsymptoms, and the 5-year survival rate of advanced HCC patients was<20%.
[9,10]Currently, the clinical treatment of HCC mainly includes radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgical resection alone orcombined strategy. [9,10]However, it is known that the above conventional therapeutic methods often fail to remove the tumor completely.[9,11]In addition, the unpleasant side effects related to chemoradiotherapy also seriously affects the quality of life (QoL)and immune function of patients with HCC.[9,11]Therefore, exploring new alternative regimens with better tolerance and lower toxicity for HCC patients are urgently required.Traditional Chinese medicine has been used as an complemen- tary treatment for alleviating the side effects of radiochemother- apy, improving the QoL and immune function of cancerpatients.
[12–14]Many scholars pointed out that the combination of Chinese and Western medicine for HCC may be the potential trend of clinical treatment in the future.[12–14]Sodium canthar- idinate/vitamin B6(SC/VB6, a famous insect-derived traditionalChinese medicine) is a combination of sodium cantharidinate and VB6, and has the pharmacological characteristics of both. [11,15,16] SC is a derivative of cantharidin, which is extracted from the body of meloidae insects such as Mylabris phalerata pallas andMylabris cichorii linnaeus .[11,17]SC preserves the unique anti-cancer activity of cantharidin and has lower toxicity and fewer adverseeffects.[11,15,17]Its combination with VB6 can even further lower the side effects.[11,15]Previous studies suggest that the anti-tumor mechanisms of SC might be attributed to the following aspects: 1.SC can signi ﬁcantly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest by inhibition of PI3K/AKT activa-tion [18,19]; 2.
SC can induces HepG2 cells apoptosis through the LC3 autophagy and mitochondrial pathway[20]; 3. SC can exert the anti-tumor ef ﬁciency through depressing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and blocking tumor angiogenesis.[21] Other studies suggest that SC also can effectively increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents.[11,22] Several studies have indicated that the combination of SC/VB6 and classic radiochemotherapy not only exerts an enhancedtherapeutic effect against HCC, but also improve the QoL andimmune function of patients.[11,16,22]Despite the intensive clinical studies, its clinical ef ﬁcacy was still not well investigated.In this study, we are prepared to summarize the ef ﬁcacy of SC/ VB6 on survival, liver function, immune function, and QoL in patients with advanced HCC through the meta-analysis, in order to provide a helpful evidence for clinicians to formulate the bestpostoperative adjuvant treatment strategy for HCC patients.2.
Review question Is SC/VB6 injection effective on survival, liver function, immune function, and QoL in patients with HCC? 3.Objective A systematic review and meta-analysis will be performed to systematically evaluate the ef ﬁcacy of SC/VB6 injection on survival, liver function, immune function, and QoL in patients with HCC.4.Methods The protocol of this meta-analysis will be reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines.[23]Our protocol has been registered on the International Platform of RegisteredSystematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (INPLASY).The registration number was INPLASY202070121 (DOI number is 10.37766/inplasy2020.7.0121, https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2020-7-0121/).This meta-analysis is a secondary research whichbased on some previously published data.Therefore, the ethical approval or informed consent was not required.4.1.

[33,34] 4.10.2.Evidence evaluation.The evidence grade will be determined by using the guidelines of the Grading of Recom- mendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation(GRADE).The quality of all evidence will be evaluated as 4 levels (high, moderate, low, and very low).[24,35] 4.11.Dissemination plans We will disseminate the results of this systematic review by publishing the manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal.5.Discussion The chemoradiotherapy regimens commonly used to treat HCC often cause serious adverse effects, which severely affect the immune function and QoL of HCC patients.[11]Therefore, seeking an alternative therapy that can improve the immune function and QoL of patients is urgently required for tumor treatment.
SC/VB6 is a famous insect-derived traditional Chinesemedicine preparation that manufactured by Guizhou Baiqiang and Shanghai new pioneer Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. It have been approved by Chinese State Food and Drug Administration(SFDA), and granted the Manufacturing Approve Numberaccordingly (H20053863 and H20045312).Several studies have conﬁrmed that SC/VB6 plays a unique role in improving host immunity, decreasing cancer relapses and lowering the toxiceffects of chemotherapy.[11,16,22,36 –38] 5.1.Strengths and limitations Even though there was statistical analysis of published clinical trials, the exact effects of SC/VB6 injection on survival, liverfunction, immune function, and QoL in patients with HCC werestill not systematically investigated.This systematic review will conduct a systematic, comprehensive and objective evaluation of SC/VB6-based adjuvant therapy.
The ﬁndings of this analysis will provide a helpful evidence for clinicians to formulate the best postoperative adjuvant treatment strategy for patients with advanced HCC, and also provide scienti ﬁc clues for researchers in this ﬁeld. There may be a language bias with the limitation of English and Chinese studies.Author contributions Conceptualization: Min Zhu, Juan Li.Data curation: Min Zhu, Xiujing Liu.Formal analysis: Min Zhu, Xiujing Liu.Funding acquisition: Changhui Zhou.Investigation: Min Zhu, Xiujing Liu, Changhui Zhou.Methodology: Min Zhu, Xiujing Liu, Changhui Zhou.Project administration: Juan Li.Resources: Min Zhu, Juan Li.Software: Min Zhu, Juan Li.Supervision: Min Zhu, Juan Li.Validation: Changhui Zhou, Juan Li.Visualization: Min Zhu, Xiujing Liu.Writing –original draft: Min Zhu, Xiujing Liu, Changhui Zhou.Writing –review & editing: Changhui Zhou, Juan Li.References [1] Bray F, Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, et al.
