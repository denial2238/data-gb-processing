Systematic reviews of the literature were conducted to assess evidence on priority adverse health effects of excess intake of vitamin E, namely risk of impaired coagulation and bleeding, cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer. The effect on blood clotting and associated increased risk of bleeding is considered as the critical effect to establish an UL for vitamin E.No new evidence has been published that could improve the characterisation of a dose–response.The ULs for vitamin E from all dietary sources, which were previously established by the Scientific Committee on Food, are retained for all population groups, i.e.300 mg/day for adults, including pregnant and lactating women, 100 mg/day for children aged 1–3 years, 120 mg/day for 4–6 years, 160 mg/day for 7–10 years, 220 mg/day for 1 1–14 years and 260 mg/day for 15–17 years.A UL of 50 mg/day is es - tablished for infants aged 4–6 months and a UL of 60 mg/day for infants aged 7–1 1 months.
ULs apply to all stereoisomeric forms of α - tocopherol. ULs do not apply to individuals receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications (e.g.aspirin), to pa - tients on secondary prevention for CVD or to patients with vitamin K malabsorp - tion syndromes.It is unlikely that the ULs for vitamin E are exceeded in European populations, except for regular users of food supplements containing high doses of vitamin E.KEYWORDS tolerable upper intake level, vitamin E, α - tocopherol 2 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E CONTENTS Abstract ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................1 1.Introduction ..............................................................................................................................................................................................................

58 Annexes .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 104 4 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E 1 | INTRODUCTION 1.1 | Background as provided by the European Commission Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods and Article 5 of Directive 2002/46/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements provide that maximum amount of vitamins and minerals added to foods and to food supplements, respectively, shall be set.
The above- mentioned provisions lay down the criteria to be taken into account when establishing these maximum amounts that include the upper safe levels (ULs) of vitamins and minerals established by scientific risk assessment based on ‘ generally accepted scientific data, taking into account, as appropriate, the varying degrees of sensitivity of different groups of consumers .’ To set maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals in fortified foods and food supplements, the Commission would like to ask the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to review the previous opinions of the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) or the NDA Panel on the ULs for vitamin A,1 folic acid/folate1, vitamin D1, vitamin E1, Vitamin B61, iron1, manganese1 and β- carotene1 to take into account recent scientific developments and evidence.
In this context, EFSA should first review the guidelines of the SCF1 for the development of tolerable upper intake levels for vitamins and minerals (adopted on 19 October 2000). Tolerable Upper Intake Levels should be presented separately for the age group from 4/6 months onwards until 3 years of age and the general population group from 3 years onwards, taking into account, as appropriate, the varying degrees of sensitivity of different consumer groups.As foods intended for the general population are also consumed by young children, young children should be considered as a potentially sensitive consumer group.1.2 | Terms of Reference as provided by the European Commission In accordance with Article 29(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002,2 the European Commission requests the European Food Safety Authority to: 1.
Update the guidelines of the SCF for the development of Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for vitamins and minerals in the light of available recent scientific and methodological developments. 2.Review existing scientific evidence and provide advice on tolerable upper intake levels for the following vitamins and minerals including their currently authorised forms for the addition to fortified foods and food supplements for the gen - eral population and, as appropriate, for vulnerable subgroups of the population: • vitamin A • folic acid/folate • vitamin D • vitamin E • iron • manganese • β- carotene • vitamin B6 For nutrients for which there are no, or insufficient, data on which to base the establishment of an UL, an indication should be given on the highest level of intake where there is reasonable confidence in data on the absence of adverse effects.
1.3 | Interpretation of the Terms of Reference According to the mandate, EFSA has first reviewed the guidelines of the SCF for the development of tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals (SCF, 2000 ). A draft guidance has been endorsed by the Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) Panel and published for a 1- year pilot phase EFSA NDA Panel ( 2022 ), after which it will be revised and complemented as necessary, following a public consultation.The Panel interprets that the UL for vitamin E should be revised according to the principles laid down in that guidance, following a protocol developed for that purpose (Annex A ).In the past, the term vitamin E was used as the generic term for four tocopherols ( α, β, γ, δ) and four tocotrienols ( α, β, γ, δ), collectively known as tocochromanols.However, in its opinion on Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for vitamin E from 1SCF ( 2000 ).Scientific Committee on Food.
Guidelines of the Scientific Committee on Food for the Development of Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for Vitamins and Minerals. in: Scientific Committee on Food, Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (2006).Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for Vitamins and Minerals.2Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety.OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p.1–24.| 5 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E 2015, the Panel concluded that, based on the available evidence and in line with other authoritative bodies, α - tocopherol was the only physiologically active vitamer (EFSA NDA Panel, 2015 ).Consistently, the Panel assesses the UL for vitamin E as α- tocopherol.
All sources of α - tocopherol authorised for addition to foods and food supplements in the EU are covered by the assessment. In the rest of this opinion, the expression ‘vitamin E’ is used when citing reports or articles which referred to the old definition (i.e.including α - tocopherol and other tocochromanols) or which did not specify the forms included.Vitamin E (without quotation marks) refers to α - tocopherol only.1.4 | Context of the assessment Previous safety assessments by the SCF and EFSA The SCF evaluated the UL for ‘vitamin E’ in 2003 (SCF, 2003 ).The Committee considered the effect of ‘vitamin E’ on blood clotting as the critical effect and identified the study by Meydani et al.( 1998 ) as the best basis to identify a reference point.The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) established in this study was 800 IU/day (540 mg/day).The Committee concluded that ‘an uncertainty factor (UF) of 2 would adequately cover interindividual differences in sensitivity.
A larger UF was not considered necessary because data from a number of other older but less well controlled studies showed no adverse effects at considerably higher intakes.’ A UL of 300 mg/day was established for adults. The same UL was applied to pregnant and lactating women.ULs for children and adolescents were extrapolated from the UL for adults based on body surface area0.75 (allometric scaling).No UL was established for infants (< 1- year old).The safety and bioavailability of different preparations of ‘vitamin E’ as nutrient sources were previously assessed by EFSA (EFSA AFC Panel, 2005 , 2008 ): • Assessment of d- α- tocopheryl acid succinate (TAS) for particular nutritional purposes, foods intended for the general population and food supplements: the Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food (AFC) derived a NOAEL of 265 mg TAS/kg body weight (bw) per day from a 90- day oral toxicity study in rats.
Considering a high- level ‘vitamin E’ intake from supplements of 336 mg/day in adults [equivalent to 5.6 mg/kg bw per day], and assuming that the bioavailability in humans and rats is similar, a margin of safety of 47.3 was calculated, which was considered acceptable. The Panel concluded that TAS, as a source of ‘vitamin E’, in foods for particular nutritional purposes, foods intended for the general population and food supplements was not of concern from the safety point of view (EFSA AFC Panel, 2005 ).• Assessment of ‘mixed tocopherols’, ‘tocotrienol tocopherol’ and ‘tocotrienols’ for use in food supplements: regarding tocoph - erols, the AFC Panel considered the UL of 300 mg per day for adults set by the SCF and the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.15–2 mg/kg bw per day calculated as α - tocopherol set by JECFA.
Regarding tocotrienols, the Panel derived a NOAEL of 120 mg tocotrienol extract/kg bw per day for male rats and 130 mg tocotrienol extract/kg bw per day for female rats based on a 90- day study conducted with a tocotrienol- rich palm oil extract (70% tocotrienols). Considering the products specifications and proposed conditions of use, the AFC Panel considered the use of ‘mixed tocopherols’ and ‘tocotrie - nol tocopherol’ as sources of ‘vitamin E’ in food supplements for the general population not to be of safety concern.However, the available safety data were deemed insufficient to conclude on the safety of the preparation containing mainly tocotrienols at the proposed use levels (up to 1000 mg/day) (EFSA AFC Panel, 2008 ).In 2015, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) re- evaluated the safety of tocopherol- rich extract (E 306), α - tocopherol (E 307), γ - tocopherol (E 308) and δ - tocopherol (E 309) as food additives (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015 ).
There was no concern that tocopherols were genotoxic or carcinogenic. Data were considered insufficient to address the reproductive and developmental toxicity.The Panel considered prolonged coagulation time as the critical adverse effect.The Panel considered that the available data were too limited to establish an ADI for the tocopherols.However, given that ‘vitamin E’ is widely consumed from natural sources, it is an essential nutrient and that the ULs established by the SCF were not exceeded in any population group, except in children in one survey, α - tocopherol (E 307) was not considered to be of safety concern at the reported uses and use levels as a food additive.The Panel noted that lower concentrations and fewer uses for γ - and δ- tocopherol are reported in food than for α - tocopherol and concluded that other tocopherols (E 306, E 308, E 309) were not of safety concern at the levels used in food.
The safety and efficacy of vitamin E ( all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate, RRR- α- tocopheryl acetate and RRR - α- tocopherol) as a feed additive for all animal species has been assessed by the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP). The Panel identified no safety concerns for the consumer and concluded that there was no need to propose a maximum content for vitamin E in feed under this aspect (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2010 ).In 2012, the Panel extended its con - clusions to synthetic all rac - α- tocopherol (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2012 ).Adequate Intakes for vitamin E In 2015, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, Allergies (NDA) evaluated DRVs for vitamin E (EFSA NDA Panel, 2015 ).
Data showed that α - tocopherol was the only physiologically active vitamer, as blood α - tocopherol concentrations are maintained by the preferential binding of α - tocopherol (compared to other tocopherols or tocotrienols) by the α - tocopherol 6 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E transfer protein ( α- TTP). Thus, based on the available evidence and in line with other authoritative bodies, the Panel con - sidered vitamin E as being α - tocopherol only.Also, among chemically synthesised α - tocopherol forms, only 2R- α- tocopherol stereoisomers (i.e.RRR- , RRS- , RSR- , RSS- ) were found to meet human requirements for the vitamin, because the 2S- stereoisomers (i.e.SSS- , SSR- , SRS- , SRR- ) possess low affinity for α - TTP and are rapidly metabolised in the liver.3 The Panel considered that average requirements (ARs) and population reference intakes (PRIs) for vitamin E, as α- tocopherol, could not be derived due to insufficient data.
Therefore, the Panel established an adequate intake (AI) for adults of 13 mg/day for males and 1 1 mg/day for females, based on observed dietary intakes in healthy populations with no apparent α - tocopherol deficiency. The same approach was applied to defined AIs for children and adolescents: 6 mg/ day for children aged 1–3 years, 9 mg/day for children aged 3–10 years, 13 mg/day for children and adolescent males aged 10–18 years and 1 1 mg/day for children and adolescent females aged 10–18 years.For infants aged 7–1 1 months, an AI for α- tocopherol of 5 mg/day was extrapolated upwards from the estimated α - tocopherol intake in exclusively breast- fed infants aged 0–6 months, using allometric scaling.
1.5 | Previous assessments by other bodies Like the SCF ( Section 1.4), previous safety assessments of vitamin E intake by other bodies considered the effect on blood coagulation/increased tendency to haemorrhage as the critical effect of excess vitamin E intake (EVM, 2003 ; IOM, 2001 ; NHMRC, 2006 ). The Institute of Medicine (IOM) used the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 500 mg/kg bw per day derived from a 2- year toxicity study in rats (Wheldon et al., 1983 ), as a reference point.This LOAEL was found to be consistent with the results of two additional toxicity study in rats, i.e.a shorter term feeding study (Takahashi et al., 1990 ) and a gavage study (Abdo et al., 1986 ).A UF of 36 was applied to account for the extrapolation of the LOAEL to a NOAEL (UF = 2), from subchronic to chronic intake (UF = 2) and from experimental animals to humans (UF = 3), and to cover for interindividual variation in sensitivity (UF = 3).
A UL of 1000 mg/day was established for adults, which applied to all eight stereoisomers of α- tocopherol. The same value was set for pregnant and lactating women.For children and adolescents, the values were extrapolated from the UL established for adults based on relative body weight ( Table 1).For infants, the UL was judged not determinable because of insufficient data on adverse effects in this age group and concern about the infant's ability to handle excess amounts.The IOM recommended that the only source of intake for infants should be from food and formula (IOM, 2001 ).The UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM) established a NOAEL of 800–1600 IU/day (540–970 mg RRR- α- tocopherol equivalents/day) based on three trials (Gillilan et al., 1977 ; Meydani et al., 1998 ; Stephens et al., 1996 ) which did not indicate adverse effects at these supplemental doses.
The Committee considered that no uncertainty factor was necessary and established a safe upper level of 540 mg RRR- α- tocopherol equivalents/day for supplemental ‘vitamin E’ (Table 1) (EVM, 2003 ). In line with the approach followed by the SCF, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) established a UL of 300 mg/day of for adults, applicable also to pregnant and lactating women (NHMRC, 2006 ) (Table 1).The ULs for chil - dren and adolescents were derived by applying isometric scaling.No UL for infants was set but the committee considered that the source of intake should be breast milk, formula and food only.3For this reason, the IOM redefined the human vitamin E requirement in milligrams of 2 R- α- tocopherol and provided conversion factors, such that 1 mg all rac - α- tocopherol has the same biologic activity as 0.5 mg RRR - α- tocopherol (IOM, 2001 ).TABLE 1 Overview of existing tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for ‘vitamin E’, in mg/day.

(Hazard identification and characterisation) .• What is the daily intake of α - tocopherol from all dietary sources in EU populations?(Intake assessment) .
• What is the risk of adverse effects related to the intake of α - tocopherol in EU populations, including attendant uncertain - ties? (Risk characterisation) .The hazard identification and hazard characterisation relate to the identification of adverse health effects of a given nu - trient and the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the adverse health effects associated with the nutrient, including dose–response assessment and derivation of a UL, if possible.Adverse (health) effects are defined as ‘a change in the morphology, physiology, growth, development, reproduction or life span of an organism, system or (sub)population that results in an impairment of functional capacity to compensate for additional stress or an increase in susceptibility to other influences’ (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2017a ).
‘The observable effects of high nutrient intake within the causal pathway of an adverse health effect can range from biochemical changes without functional significance (e.g., certain changes in enzyme activity) to irreversible clinical outcomes. Notably, some changes that occur before clinical manifestations could be used as surrogate or predictive markers of subsequent adverse health effects, i.e.biomarkers of effect’ (EFSA NDA Panel, 2022 ).Available risk assessments on dietary ‘vitamin E’ intakes from authoritative bodies (WHO/FAO, 2004 ) and systematic review identified in the literature (Loh et al., 2022 ; O'Connor et al., 2022 ; Schürks et al., 2010 ) were used to identify adverse health effects that have been associated with excess intakes in humans.As a result, the following priority adverse health effects, i.e.
those that are expected to play a critical role for establishing a UL, were identified: impaired blood coagulation and risk of bleeding, cardiovascular disease risk and cardiovascular mortality and risk of prostate cancer and prostate can - cer mortality. The rationale for the prioritisation is detailed in the protocol (Annex A ).Regarding the target population for this assessment, the Panel notes that, in its previous opinion, the SCF noted that oral intakes of high amounts of ‘vitamin E’ can increase blood coagulation defects in subjects with vitamin K deficiency caused by malabsorption or due to therapy with anticoagulants (SCF, 2003 ).Therefore, the UL was not considered to apply to patients receiving anticoagulant drugs or to patients with malabsorption syndromes, nor to other conditions where the synthesis of vitamin K by the gut microbiota might be impaired.
In addition, the SCF noted some evidence that ‘vitamin E’ can increase the risk of haemorrhage in individuals taking aspirin. The Panel notes that the restrictions identified by the SCF still hold and that these groups are under specific medical management.Thus, patients receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs and patients with vitamin K malabsorption syndromes are excluded from the target population for this assessment.As a result of the problem formulation, the overarching risk assessment questions were further specified into assess - ment subquestions (sQs) and the methods to address each sQ was selected as outlined in Table 2.
The assessment should cover α- tocopherol from all dietary sources, including all α- tocopherol forms authorised for addition to foods and food supplements in the EU.Population groups SCF ( 2003 )aEVM ( 2003 )bIOM ( 2001 )cNHMRC ( 2006 )d Adults ≥ 18 year 300f540 – – ≥ 19 year – – 1000f300f Abbreviations: EVM, Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals; IOM, Institute of Medicine; nd, not defined; NHMRC, National Health and Medical Research Council; SCF, Scientific Committee on Food. aIn mg ‘vitamin E’ (i.e.all tocochromanols).bIn mg RRR - α- tocopherol equivalents/day; the value applies to supplemental ‘vitamin E’ (i.e.all tocochromanols).cIn mg α - tocopherol/day; the values apply to any form of supplementary α - tocopherol.dIn mg α - tocopherol equivalents/day; the value applies to supplemental ‘vitamin E’ (i.e.all tocochromanols).eSource of intake should be breast milk, formula and food only.

The pro - cesses applied for evidence retrieval, study selection and data extraction are summarised below.2.2.1.1 | Priority adverse health effects To address sQ2a, sQ3a and sQ4a, relevant human studies on the selected adverse health effects were identified through systematic searches of the literature in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for articles published in English.The search strategies were created by information specialists of ESFA (Annex B ).The searches were performed from October to December 2023.Grey literature was not searched.
Retrieved articles were screened in duplicate in Distiller SR® at title and abstract level, also with the use of the artificial intelligence tool of Distiller SR® as second reviewer. Full- text screening for inclusion/exclusion was performed in duplicate by human reviewers according to the criteria defined in the protocol (Annex A ).Relevant systematic reviews were hand- searched for additional pertinent studies.Reviews, expert opinions, editorials, letters to the editors, abstracts, posters and theses were excluded.Eligible designs: • For sQ2a, eligible study designs were limited to human intervention studies (randomised or non- randomised, controlled and uncontrolled).• For sQ3a and sQ4a, eligible study designs were human controlled trials (randomised or non- randomised) and prospec - tive observational studies (prospective cohort studies (PCs), nested case–control studies (NCCs) and case- cohort studies (CCs))TABLE 2 Assessment subquestions and methods to address them.

| 9 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E Eligible study populations : • For sQ2a, studies were eligible if they involved individuals of any age (except premature infants). Studies in people with health conditions were not excluded a priori (their relevance for the general population will be assessed on a case- by- case basis), except for diseases affecting liver, pancreatic or gastrointestinal function, vitamin K malabsorption syn - dromes, medical conditions that could affect blood coagulation independently of α - tocopherol supplementation.Also, studies among individuals receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs were excluded.• For sQ3a and sQ4a, eligible studies were restricted to adults.Studies in people with health conditions are not excluded a priori and their relevance for the general population was assessed on a case- by- case basis.
Eligible exposure measurements : Human intervention studies were eligible if they investigated oral α - tocopherol supple - mentation versus placebo/no treatment/lower doses. Observational studies were eligible if they measured total ‘vitamin E’ or total α - tocopherol intake (i.e.from diet and supplements) or supplemental ‘vitamin E’ or α - tocopherol by dietary assessment methods.In relation to sQ2a, 7857 references were identified (flow chart in Appendix A.1).The title and abstract screening left 551 relevant articles that underwent a full- text review.Two articles were identified via references.Thirteen articles were included.In relation to sQ3a, 4734 references were identified (flow chart in Appendix A.2).The title and abstract screening left 105 relevant articles that underwent a full- text review.One article was identified via references.Thirty- two articles were included.In relation to sQ4a, 152 references were identified (flow chart in Appendix A.3).
The title and abstract screening left two relevant articles. Additional relevant 36 articles were reported in the systematic review by Loh et al.( 2022 ) that served as the main source of data of this sQ.Thirty- eight articles underwent a full- text review.Seventeen articles were included.When the form and/or dose of oral α - tocopherol supplementation was not clearly stated in the eligible publications, study authors were contacted by EFSA.A response was not received in all cases, and thus, the exact form was not available for all studies.Data were extracted by EFSA into Microsoft Excel®, for the purpose of data plotting and analysis, and in Microsoft Word® for the preparation of evidence tables.2.2.1.2 | Other background information The evidence used to inform sQ1, sQ2b, sQ3b, sQ4b, sQ5 was retrieved from textbooks, authoritative reviews and research papers through non- systematic searches in bibliographic databases and was synthesised as narrative reviews.
In addition, for sQ5, studies reporting on the other adverse health outcomes identified in the protocol (i.e. all- cause mortality, cataract, pregnancy- related outcome, respiratory infection) were also identified through the full- text review of the articles retrieved for sQ2a (see above).As a result, 22 relevant publications were retrieved, which are discussed in Section 3.4.4 .2.2.2 | Methodologies The methodology for this assessment follows the guidance for establishing ULs developed by the NDA Panel (EFSA NDA Panel, 2022 ).
Other guidance documents from EFSA were also considered, including those addressing the application of the systematic review methodology in food and feed safety assessments (EFSA, 2010 ), the principles and processes for dealing with data and evidence in scientific assessments (EFSA, 2015 ), the statistical significance and biological relevance (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2011 ), the biological relevance of data (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2017a ), the use of the weight of evidence approach (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2017b ), the appraisal and integration of evidence from epidemiolog - ical studies (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2020 ) and the analysis of uncertainty in scientific assessments (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2018 ). 2.2.2.1 | Evidence synthesis All authorised forms of α - tocopherol (i.e.either free or as esters, natural and synthetic) were eligible for the assessment.For harmonisation purposes, the opinion applies the current nomenclature, i.e.
natural forms (historically called d- α- tocopherol) are named RRR - α- tocopherol and esters, and synthetic forms (historically called dl - α- tocopherol) are named all rac- (racemic) α - tocopherol and esters (see Section 3.1). Depending on papers, study doses were reported in International Units (IU)4 of ‘vitamin E’ or in mg of ‘free' α - tocopherol or its esters.To allow study comparisons, doses were standardised into mg of ‘free' α - tocopherol by applying the conver - sion factors reported in Table 3.For instance, 400 IU all rac- α- tocopheryl acetate corresponds to 400 mg all rac- α- tocopheryl 4The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) defined the IU for vitamin E relative to the synthetic form, racemic all rac- α- tocopheryl acetate, i.e.1 IU = 1 mg of all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate (USP, 1979 , 1999 ).10 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E acetate and 364 mg ‘free' α- tocopherol.
For critical studies, authors were contacted when the chemical form was not re - ported in the article. When no information could be obtained, the opinion provides the dose as reported in the article.When the supplemental dose was given an alternate days, it was converted into a daily dose by dividing the amount by two.For sQ3a and sQ4a, relevant results from eligible studies were plotted in descriptive forest plots.2.2.2.2 | Evidence integration and uncertainty analysis Hazard identification Regarding sQ2a, a causal relationship between ‘high’ α - tocopherol intake and changes in coagulation parameters and/or blinding is well established, and the assessment focussed on the characterisation of a dose–response and whether new evidence could lead to a revision of the previously established NOAEL based on this endpoint.
Regarding sQ3a and sQ4a, the hazard identification step consisted of assessing the evidence for a causal positive rela - tionship between intake of α - tocopherol and the health effects identified. Conclusions on each health effect are reached by study design (human interventions separately from observational studies), through considering the uncertainties in the body of evidence (BoE) and in the methods.EFSA applies a stepwise approach for the formulation of hazard identification conclusions ( Figure 1).It includes a prioritisation step to identify health effects for which the available BoE suggests a posi - tive relationship between the dietary intake of nutrient and risk of disease/impaired function.This is based on a preliminary uncertainty analysis (UA).The Panel considers that health effects for which the available BoE (i) does not suggest a positive relationship (i.e.
the relationship appears to be negative or null) or (ii) is insufficient to conclude on a relationship, cannot be used to inform the setting of a UL. Data gaps and research needs are identified, where appropriate.When the available BoE indicates a positive association between the intake of the nutrient and the risk of a disease/impaired function, a com - prehensive UA is performed to inform the formulation of the hazard identification conclusions, i.e.judgement on the level of certainty for a causal relationship.In this assessment, the evaluation of the evidence for sQ3a and sQ4a stopped at the prioritisation step, i.e.the Panel concludes that the available BoEs could not be used to derive ULs for α - tocopherol.No comprehensive uncertainty analysis was conducted.TABLE 3 Factors applied to standardise doses of α - tocopherol esters to mg ‘free' α- tocopherol.

ULs are established to protect all members of the general population, including sensitive individuals, throughout their lifetime. However, the UL may exclude subpopulations with distinct vulnerabilities to adverse effects of nutrient ‘excess’ due to specific genetic predisposition or other factors (e.g.specific (chronic) medical conditions or use of certain medications).Including those subpopulations would result in ULs which are significantly lower than needed to protect most people against adverse effects of high nutrient intakes.Subpopulations needing special protection are better served through public health screening, healthcare providers, product labelling or other individualised strategies.The exclusion of such subpopulations must be considered on a nutrient- by- nutrient basis and is an area of scientific judgement and of risk management.
In practice, the exclusion of a sub- population from a UL should take into consideration whether individuals from that group can be identified (e.g. through screening, diagnosis).2.3 | Dietary intake assessment The assessment follows the approach outlined in the protocol for the intake assessments performed in the context of the revision of ULs for selected nutrients (EFSA, 2022 ).Briefly, the EFSA food composition database (FCDB)5 and the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database (hereinafter referred as Comprehensive Database)6 were used to obtain harmonised estimates of the intake α- tocopherol from the background diet in EU populations.Other data sources were used to gather non- harmonised 5https:// www.efsa.europa.eu/ it/ data- report/ food- consu mption- data .6https:// www.efsa.europa.eu/ it/ data- report/ food- compo sition- data .FIGURE 1 Stepwise approach for evidence integration and uncertainty analysis.BoE, body of evidence; LoE, line of evidence.
12 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E estimates of the intake of α - tocopherol from the background diet, fortified foods and food supplements, either alone or in combination, in European countries (i.e. intake estimates from nationally representative food consumption surveys), and data on the amounts of α - tocopherol used for food fortification and in food supplements (i.e.Mintel Global New Product Database (GNPD)).2.3.1 | Data Previously, the term vitamin E was used as the generic term for tocochromanols, which include four tocopherols ( α, β, γ, δ) and four tocotrienols ( α, β, γ, δ).Various factors have been used to convert food contents of tocopherols and tocotrienols to α- tocopherol equivalents ( α- TE) (EFSA NDA Panel, 2015 ).Due to the evolution of the definition of ‘vitamin E’, food composition data are not harmonised and sometimes ambig - uous as to whether the ‘vitamin E’ content reported refers to α - tocopherol only or include all tocochromanols.
Food com - position data are still commonly expressed in α - TE. Regarding product labelling, the generic term ‘vitamin E’ is used for nutrition declarations, with reference to a nutrient reference value (NRV) of 12 mg/day ‘vitamin E’ (Regulation (EU) No 1169/ 20117).These are sources of uncertainty when collecting data on the α - tocopherol content of food.Some assumptions had to be applied, which are described below.2.3.1.1 | Intake data calculated by EFSA in 2015 Intakes of α - tocopherol for all population groups (excluding food supplements) were previously estimated in the con - text of the scientific opinion on DRVs for vitamin E as α- tocopherol (EFSA NDA Panel, 2015 ).Food intake data from the Comprehensive Database and data on content in foods from the FCDB were used (Roe et al., 2013 ).
Given that the EFSA FCDB has not been updated since the 2015 EFSA assessment, and the number of national surveys that were newly inte - grated in the Comprehensive Database is limited, the intake estimates published in 2015 are still considered adequate for the purpose of the present assessment and were not updated. In 2015, the Panel aimed at estimating intakes of α - tocopherol.However, only two national databases (Finland and Sweden) contained data on α - tocopherol only.Most food composition databases in EU countries contained values for ‘vi - tamin E’ expressed as α - TEs, i.e.included other tocopherols and tocotrienols.A definition of α - TE or the conversion factors applied to the other tocochromanols were not reported.Because of the limited data available on the α- tocopherol content of food, EFSA estimated intakes of both α - tocopherol and α- TEs ( Section 3.3.2 ).
Regarding the use of α - tocopherol containing supplements, data in the Comprehensive Database have important lim - itations, in particular due to partial reporting in the database of the nutrient(s) contained in food supplements. In view of the uncertainties associated with these data, the Panel relied on information available from national dietary surveys to perform its assessment (see Section 2.3.1.2 on other data sources).2.3.1.2 | Other data sources Food consumption data Between September and November 2021, 64 competent authorities in 37 European countries have been contacted through the EFSA Focal Points8 and the EFSA Food Consumption Network9 to obtain ‘vitamin E’ intake estimates from nat - ural sources, fortified foods and food supplements from nationally representative food consumption surveys (no date limits applied).Data from fortified foods and food supplements were of particular relevance as these estimates were ab - sent from the 2015 EFSA's assessment.
An additional search in sources of bibliographic information (Google Scholar, PubMed) was performed to collect reports of national surveys included in the Comprehensive Database that had not been obtained through the competent authorities. Between August and October 2022, EFSA contacted all EU Member States and Norway through the European Commission WG on Food supplements and Fortified foods10 and collected data specif - ically on the intake of ‘vitamin E’ from food supplements.The majority of the national food consumption surveys covered by this data collection relied on 24- h recalls, sometimes in combination with food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), food propensity questionnaires (FPQ) or food records to assess dietary intake.Intakes were reported in mg of α - tocopherol or mg of α - TEs11 (see Section 3.3.3 and Annex D ).

| 13 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E Food composition data The Mintel GNPD was used as a data source to identify the type and content of food supplements and fortified foods containing added α - tocopherol, available on the EU market. The search was conducted in December 2022, and was limited to the 5 years before, i.e.between December 2017 and December 2022 ( Section 3.3.1 ).The Panel notes that this search allows to capture the products that were newly introduced on the market and the products for which the packaging was changed during that period.Therefore, the information collected is indicative and does not represent a comprehensive overview of the products available on the market.
The following search strategy was applied: • Food supplements : products belonging to Mintel category ‘vitamins and dietary supplements’, which reported ‘vitamin E’ on their nutrition declaration and reported an authorised form of α - tocopherol ( Table 4) in their ingredient list, were selected. Food supplements that contained mixtures of tocochromanols were excluded as the α - tocopherol content could not be identified (ca.one- third of the products identified through the search).• Fortified foods : a search for foods and beverages with ‘vitamin E’ in both the nutrition declaration and the ingredient list was performed, under the assumption that these were products fortified with α - tocopherol.Products for which the source of ‘vitamin E’ was identified to be seed or vegetable oil from the ingredient list were excluded as these are natural sources of mixed tocopherols and the proportion of α - tocopherol is unknown.
• Products retrieved through these searches, which contained tocopherols used as additives (labelled as E306, E307 , E308, E309, ‘antioxidants’), were excluded from the data sets. Regulation (EC) No 1925/200612 on addition of nutrients to foods requires food manufacturers to label vitamin E content in mg ‘vitamin E’.As α - tocopherol (free and esters) is the only tocochromanol authorised for addition to food ( Table 4), α- tocopherol was assumed to be the predominant form in the fortified foods identified through the search and the doses reported were assumed to refer to mg α - tocopherol.Directive 2002/46/EC13 on addition of nutrients to food supplements requires to label vitamin E content in mg α- tocopherol equivalents (mg α - TE).As described above, food supplements that contained mixtures of tocochromanols were excluded.Thus, doses that were expressed in mg α - TE on the label of the products retrieved through the search were assumed to correspond to mg α - tocopherol.
2.3.2 | Methodologies 2.3.2.1 | Intake data calculated by EFSA in 2015 EFSA's intake estimates were calculated by matching the food intake data from the Comprehensive Database and the food composition data from the FCDB as available in 2015 (EFSA NDA Panel, 2015 ) (Section 3.3.2 ). Food composition data from Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden were used for the estima - tions.‘Vitamin E' content in food was reported as mg α - tocopherol in the national composition databases of Finland and Sweden, while the national databases of France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia and the Netherlands reported contents as mg α- TEs.14 For nutrient intake estimates of Ireland and Latvia, food composition data from the UK and Germany, respec - tively, were used, because no specific composition data from these countries were available.The percentage of borrowed values in the α - TE data sets of the FCDB varied between 12% and 92%, 35%–56% of these values being from Germany.
The average values of the food contents in the Finnish and Swedish databases were used to calculate α - tocopherol intake in France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. To determine α- TEs intake in Finland and Sweden, the average values of the food contents in France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands were used.Data on intake estimates for infants (≥ 4 to < 12 months), which were not in the remit of the DRV Opinion from 2015, have been added to the present assessment.The methodology applied to estimated intakes in this population group is the same as for the other age groups.2.3.2.2 | Other data sources Data on α- tocopherol intakes from recent national food consumption surveys, including specific estimates of α- tocopherol intake from food supplements and/or fortified foods (as described in Section 2.3.1.2 ), were extracted ( Section 3.3.3 ).
Information on food products fortified with α - tocopherol and α- tocopherol- containing supplements available on the EU market, and their α - tocopherol content as reported on the label was extracted from the Mintel GNPD ( Section 3.3.1 ). 12Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods.OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p.26–38.13Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements.OJ L 183, 12.7.2002, p.51–57.14The factors applied to convert the tocopherols and tocotrienols contents into α - TEs in these databases were not available.
14 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E These data were used qualitatively to describe the types of fortified foods and food supplements available and to gain insight into their potential contribution to total α - tocopherol intake. 2.4 | Public consultation In line with EFSA's policy on openness and transparency, and for EFSA to receive comments from the scientific community and stakeholders, the draft Scientific Opinion was released for public consultation from 13 May to 9 June 2024.The out - come of the public consultation was described in a technical report published as Annex to the Scientific Opinion.3 | ASSESSMENT 3.1 | Chemical forms The term tocochromanols encompasses the four tocopherols and four tocotrienols synthesised by plants.These molecules have similar ring structures: trimethyl ( α- ), dimethyl ( β- or γ- ) and monomethyl ( δ- ) chromanols.Tocopherols have a phytyl side chain, while tocotrienols have an unsaturated side chain.
The hydroxyl group on the chromanol ring is necessary for the antioxidant function (Burton & Ingold, 1981 ). The human dietary requirement for vitamin E is met only by α - tocopherol, not other tocochromanols (EFSA NDA Panel, 2015 ; IOM, 2001 ).The chemical synthesis of α - tocopherol results in an equimolar mixture of all eight stereoisomers ( Figure 2).Half of the stereoisomers of all racemic (all rac) - α- tocopherol are in the 2 R- conformation ( RRR- , RSR- , RRS- and RSS- ), while half are in the 2S- conformation ( SRR- , SSR- , SRS- and SSS- ) (Weiser & Vecchi, 1981 ).All the stereoisomers have equivalent antioxidant activities, are equally well absorbed in the intestine, but only the 2 R- forms have vitamin E biologic activity ( Section 1.4).
With regard to nomenclature, ‘ d’ stands for dextrorotatory and ‘ l’ stands for levorotatory; which means that the plane of polarised light rotates clockwise or anticlockwise, respectively, when it passes through a pure solution of the compound of interest. Originally, RRR - α- tocopherol isolated from plant oil was labelled ‘ d’.The initial chemical α - tocopherol synthesis used phytol of plant origin and a chemically synthesised chromanol group, such that the tail bonded to the ring with half of the molecules in the 2 R- conformation ( RRR- ) and half in the 2S- conformation ( SRR- )- this compound was called ‘2- ambo’ and labelled for commerce as ‘ dl’ because it no longer rotated light.Subsequently, chemically synthesised phytol was used for chemical α - tocopherol synthesis.
The product was an equimolar racemic mixture of all eight possible stereoisomers and was called all rac - α- tocopherol but was labelled for commerce as ‘ dl’ because the biological effects of all rac - and ambo- α- tocopherols were indistinguishable (Weiser & Vecchi, 1981 ).FIGURE 2 Chemical structure of different α - tocopherol forms. Note : A: Natural α - tocopherol (i.e.RRR- α- tocopherol).RRR refers to R- conformation at the 2, 4 and 8 positions; B: Synthetic α - tocopherol (e.g.SSR- α- tocopherol).SSR refers to S- conformation at the 2, 4 and R- conformation at the 8 positions.Synthetic (all rac- ) α- tocopherol include half of the stereoisomers in the 2R- conformation (RRR- , RSR- , RRS- and RSS- ), and half in the 2S- conformation (SRR- , SSR- , SRS- and SSS- ).
| 15 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E In the EU, RRR- α- tocopherol, all rac- α- tocopherol, RRR- α- tocopheryl acetate, all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate and RRR - α- tocopheryl acid succinate may be added to foods and food supplements, whereas ‘mixed tocopherols’15 and ‘tocotrienol tocopherol’16 may be added to food supplements only ( Table 4). 3.2 | Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) 3.2.1 | Absorption The absorption of α - tocopherol and other tocochromanols, like for other lipid compounds, involves non- specific transport - ers in the small intestine.Dietary tocochromanols, along with bile acids and products of fat digestion, are incorporated into mixed micelles, and the contents are taken up by intestinal enterocytes.α - Tocopheryl esters must be hydrolysed by pancreatic esterases to release α - tocopherol for incorporation into micelles.
The α - tocopherol absorption rates, when ad - ministered either as free α - tocopherol or the ester forms, are similar (Cheeseman et al., 1995 ). Tocochromanol uptake into intestinal enterocytes is facilitated by several transporters including Niemann- Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR BI), cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and ATP- binding cassette A1 (ABCA1).Upon entry into enterocytes, tocochromanols and other fat- soluble compounds accumulate in lipid drop - lets.Tocochromanols in lipid droplets coalesce with nascent chylomicrons through the apolipoprotein B48 pathway.Chylomicrons are then secreted into the lymph for subsequent delivery to the circulation.Tocochromanols take a pro - longed time (9–12 h) from being consumed for maximal concentrations to enter the circulation, a process that is promoted by a subsequent meal (Traber et al., 2019 ).
This multistep process over time allows additional triacylglycerides and various fat- soluble compounds, including tocochromanols, to be incorporated into chylomicrons. Based on a review of available data, the Panel previously considered that the average α - tocopherol absorption from a usual diet would be about 75% (EFSA NDA Panel, 2015 ).This was based on the means observed in two balance studies (75% and 69%) (Kelleher & Losowsky, 1968 ; MacMahon & Neale, 1970 ) and in a kinetic study using radioactive α - tocopherol and multi- compartmental modelling (81%) (Novotny et al., 2012 ).A more recent study using a dual- isotope method in healthy women estimated an average absorption of 55% of the oral dose (Traber et al., 2019 ).The unabsorbed oral α - tocopherol dose was excreted in the faeces.
3.2.2 | Distribution 3.2.2.1 | Hepatic α - tocopherol secretion and lipoprotein transport Although all dietary tocochromanols are absorbed and delivered to the liver via chylomicrons remnants, only 2R - α- tocopherol is preferentially secreted from the liver. The hepatic α - TTP participates in a multistep process that results in plasma lipoprotein enrichment in α - tocopherol (Arai & Kono, 2021 ).α- TTP binds 2 R- α- tocopherol with the highest af - finity compared to other tocochromanols (Hosomi et al., 1997 ).It is responsible for the preferential incorporation of 2R- α- tocopherol into nascent lipoproteins (Traber et al., 1990 ).Specifically, 2 R- α- tocopherol is transferred by α - TTP to the plasma membrane and by ABCA1 to an external lipoprotein acceptor, such as circulating nascent high- density or very 15Defined in Annex II of Directive 2002/46/EC as: alpha- tocopherol < 20%, beta- tocopherol < 10%, gamma- tocopherol 50%–70% and delta- tocopherol 10%–30%.
16Defined in Annex II of Directive 2002/46/EC as: typical levels of individual tocopherols and tocotrienols: 115 mg/g alpha- tocopherol (101 mg/g minimum), 5 mg/g beta- tocopherol (< 1 mg/g minimum), 45 mg/g gamma- tocopherol (25 mg/g minimum), 12 mg/g delta- tocopherol (3 mg/g minimum), 67 mg/g alpha- tocotrienol (30 mg/g minimum), < 1 mg/g beta- tocotrienol (< 1 mg/g minimum), 82 mg/g gamma- tocotrienol (45 mg/g minimum), 5 mg/g delta- tocotrienol (< 1 mg/g minimum).TABLE 4 Forms of vitamin E authorised as nutrient sources in the EU.

However, the liver- secreted, nascent triacylglycerol- rich VLDL preferentially contain 2R - α- tocopherol (Burton et al., 1998 ; Traber et al., 1990 ). These VLDL can also undergo lipolysis in the circulation, causing α - tocopherol to be distributed to circulating low- density lipoproteins (LDL) and HDL, respectively (Traber et al., 2019 ).This VLDL- enrichment process is re - peated multiple times and enriches the plasma lipoproteins with 2 R- α- tocopherol for delivery to tissues.Moreover, the entire plasma α - tocopherol pool is replaced daily because of the continued re- secretion from the liver of VLDL containing α- tocopherol (Traber et al., 1994 ).
3.2.2.2 | Distribution to tissues The processes for tissue α - tocopherol acquisition include: (1) direct transfer to tissue membranes mediated by lipopro - tein lipase during lipolysis of triacylglyceride- rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and VLDL); (2) receptor- mediated uptake of LDL by the LDL receptor (or other receptors that recognise apoB or apoE); (3) receptor- mediated uptake of HDL by the SR- B1 or CD36 receptors; and (4) tocochromanols transfer from tocochromanol- rich lipoproteins to tocochromanol- poor membranes. There are currently no data to suggest that any tissue serves as a storage site for α - tocopherol for its release on de - mand.Thus, tissues acquire α - tocopherol by non- specific lipid- or lipoprotein- dependent mechanisms that also deliver peroxidisable fats, but it is not known how the tissues release or secrete α - tocopherol.
To study tissue concentrations relative to dosing, a 1:1 ratio of RRR - and all rac - α- tocopheryl acetates, labelled with different amounts of deuterium, were consumed by humans and the tissue concentrations and the labelled ratios measured (Burton et al., 1998 ). The ratio of RRR- :rac- measured in human tissues was 2:1, supporting that only 2 R- α- tocopherols are retained by the body (Burton et al., 1998 ).Adipose tissue contains most of the total body pool of α - tocopherol (Novotny et al., 2012 ; Traber & Kayden, 1987 ).Changes in adipose tissue α - tocopherol concentrations take years.In adults, Handelman et al.( 1994 ) found that adipose tis - sue α- tocopherol concentration increased (10%–60% according to subjects) with 800 mg/day all rac - α- tocopherol supple - mentation for 1 year compared with before supplementation, but that it did not decrease after 1 year of discontinuation of the supplement.
Adipose tissue α - tocopherol concentrations are depleted during vitamin E deficiency (Kayden et al., 1983 ) or during oxidative damage (burn injury) (Traber et al., 2010 ), and reflect depletion of peripheral nerve α - tocopherol con - centrations (Traber et al., 1987 ). 3.2.3 | Catabolism and excretion Tocochromanols undergo catabolism in the liver to water- soluble catabolites, which are excreted in the urine and bile.More than 90% of α- tocopherol catabolism to urinary α - carboxyethyl hydroxychroman ( α- CEHC) in humans takes place in the liver (Traber et al., 2019 ).This catabolic process is initiated by cytochrome P450- 4F2 (CYP4F2), which catalyses the ω- hydroxylation of the terminal methyl group of the tocochromanol side chain to 13 ′- hydroxychromanol.In murine models, this oxidation has been found to be the rate- limiting step in tocochromanol catabolism and excretion (Bardowell et al., 2012 ).
Truncation of the side chain then occurs by conversion of the 13 ′ hydroxychromanol to the 13 ′- carboxychromanol (COOH), followed by β - oxidation, ultimately yielding carboxyethyl hydroxychroman (CEHC) (Schubert et al., 2018 ). The shorter chain carboxychromanols generated by the β- oxidation process are largely conjugated with sulfate or glucuronic acid by the action of UDP- glucuronosyltransferase and are excreted in urine.Advances in analytical techniques have al - lowed detection of several conjugated forms, including α - CEHC- glucuronides, sulfates, glycine and taurine (Johnson et al., 2012 ).α- Tocopherol is a relatively poor substrate for the CYP4F2- initiated ω- oxidation pathway compared to other dietary tocochromanols.Thus, tocochromanol catabolism by CYP4F2 complements α- TTP function in promoting preferential α- tocopherol retention and excretion and catabolism of other tocochromanols.
Also, the RRR - compared with the all rac - α- tocopherol configuration is partially protected from degradation. In humans ( n = 6) supplemented with 150 mg each d3- RRR- and d6- all rac - α- tocopheryl acetates, at 24 h post- dose the plasma d3- RRR- α- tocopherol (4.1 ± 1.1 μmol/L) was double the d6- α- tocopherol concentration (1.8 ± 0.5 μmol/L).By contrast, the total α - CEHC excreted over 9 days was greater from the d6- all rac - α- tocopheryl acetates: d6- α- CEHC (1.68 ± 0.03 μmol) compared with d3- α- CEHC (0.65 ± 0.12 μmol) (Traber et al., 1998 ).Notably, the amount excreted was small relative to the administered dose.More recent studies showed similar results, when an oral 30 mg deuterated α - tocopheryl acetate dose was used to estimate catabolism and urinary excretion (n = 10).The excretion was estimated to be 0.7% (0.4%–0.9% median, range) of the oral dose, while the daily unlabelled α- CEHC excreted was 1.2 ± 0.3 μmol/g creatinine.
Over 72 h only ∼ 2% of the oral dose was found to be excreted in urine and ∼ 5% in faeces (Traber et al., 2021 ). Similar quantitative excretion values had been found in a previous study (Lebold et al., 2012 ).| 17 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E The Panel notes that although some α- tocopherol catabolism takes place in the intestine or the kidney, most catabo - lism takes place in the liver, where α - tocopherol is catabolised to long- chain carboxy- catabolites and, ultimately, α - CEHC.Notably, a relatively small fraction (< 3%) of supplemental α - tocopherol has been found to be excreted as α - CEHC in urine and faeces ( Figure 3).3.2.4 | Factors affecting the ADME of vitamin E 3.2.4.1 | Age Infants The newborn infant has low circulating α - tocopherol concentrations compared to older infants or adults (Bolisetty et al., 2002 ; Kelly et al., 1990 ; Ostrea Jr.et al., 1986 ).
These concentrations are at or below 1 1 μmol/L in cord blood from infants compared with mothers' serum at 33 μmol/L (Didenco et al., 2011 ). The low cord total lipids (cholesterol plus tri - acylglcerides) in the infants (2 ± 0.5 mmol/L) compared with the mothers (8 ± 1 mmol/L) likely accounts for the low cord α- tocopherol concentrations (Didenco et al., 2011 ).Similar findings were reported using deuterated α - tocopherols given to pregnant women and measured in cord blood (Acuff et al., 1998 ).In term neonates, plasma α - tocopherol concentrations increase rapidly during the first few weeks of feeding (González- Corbella et al., 1998 ; Ostrea Jr.et al., 1986 ; Phelps & Dietz, 1981 ).Irrespective of whether the infants were fed breast milk or infant formula, mean plasma concentrations increased from 13 μmol/L at 1 week to 27 μmol/L within 1 month (González- Corbella et al., 1998 ).
Furthermore, studies in pigs fed deuterated α - tocopherol showed that the transfer from the sows to the piglets was undetectable at birth, as were fetal tissue concentrations of labelled α - tocopherol concentrations. Tissue deuterated α - tocopherol concentration increased substantially after 1 week of consuming labelled mother's milk (Lauridsen et al., 2002 ).Stone et al.( 2003 ) investigated the bioavailability of natural versus synthetic vitamin E among infants.Within 8 days after birth, term infants were randomly assigned to consume a formula containing 20 IU natural vitamin E (14.5 mg/L RRR - α- tocopheryl acetate)/L (HNF group; n = 26), 10 IU natural vitamin E (7.3 mg/L RRR - α- tocopheryl acetate)/L (LNF group; n = 25) or 13.5 IU synthetic vitamin E (13.5 mg/L all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate)/L (SF group; n = 26).At 1 month of age, mean plasma α- tocopherol concentrations in the respective groups were 29 μmol/L, 25 μmol/L and 25 μmol/L.
In a reference group of 29 breastfed infants, the mean plasma α - tocopherol concentration was 18 μmol/L. Thus, natural ( RRR- ) α- tocopherol administered at 7.3 mg/L (LNF group) resulted in a plasma α - tocopherol concentration comparable to that obtained with twice the concentration of synthetic ( all rac - ) α- tocopherol (13.5 mg/L, SF group), indicating higher bioavailability of RRR- α- tocopherol.The amounts of 2 R- tocopherol isomers delivered by the formula were similar (LNF group: 6.7 mg/L; SF group: FIGURE 3 Pathways of α - tocopherol absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion.α - T, α- tocopheroxyl radical; α- T T P, α- tocopherol transfer protein; CEHC, Carboxyethyl- hydroxychroman; CM, Chylomicron; HDL, high- density lipoproteins; LDL, low density lipoproteins; VLDL, very low- density lipoproteins.Figure Legend: α - tocopherol in the presence of products from lipid digestion by biliary and pancreatic secretions is incorporated into mixed micelles.
A portion is absorbed into enterocytes and the remainder excreted in the faeces. Enterocytes secrete α - tocopherol- containing chylomicrons (Chy) into the lymphatics, and following transit in the circulation, acquisition of apolipoprotein E and partial lipolysis, the chylomicron remnants are taken up by the liver.Hepatic α - tocopherol ( α- T) has several possible fates: (i) α - TTP can facilitate its transfer to lipoproteins (e.g.VLDL, HDL) that transport α- T to and from the periphery; (ii) α - T can be excreted in bile; (iii) α - T can be catabolised to α - CEHC, which can be excreted in bile for faecal excretion, or secreted into plasma, transported to the kidney and excreted in urine; (iv) α - T can be oxidised by a peroxyl radical, but this is likely rapidly reduced to α - T by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate (v) α - T may remain in the liver in triacylglyceride droplets.18 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E 6.1 mg/L).
When expressed as mg 2 R- tocopherol isomers consumed/d, α - tocopherol intakes correlated with plasma α - tocopherol in this study population. Data in animals and humans suggest that the ability of the infant to discriminate between α - tocopherol stereoiso - mers is present before birth (Acuff et al., 1998 ), with evidence for higher bioavailability of RRR- α- tocopherol than all rac - α- tocopherol in early life (Dersjant- Li & Peisker, 2010 ; Stone et al., 2003 ).These outcomes are consistent with findings in rats, which showed that the expression of hepatic α- TTP was very low in the rat pups immediately after birth but increased steadily during the first weeks of life and reached adult liver levels by 4 weeks (Kim et al., 1996 ; Tamai et al., 1998 ).During the same period, a gradual increase in the plasma ratio of α - to γ- tocopherol was observed, which seemed to correlate with the increase in the hepatic expression of α - T T P.
Children Reference ranges of α - tocopherol in plasma, red blood cells and adipose tissue were reported to be relatively constant between 0 and 18 years of age. Reference ranges were 1 1.9–30 μmol/L in plasma, 2.0–7.8 μmol/L in red blood cells (RBC) and 60–573 nmol/g in adipose tissue (Cuerq et al., 2016 ).The HELENA (Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence) study, a cross- sectional evaluation of 3528 (1845 females) adolescents from 9 European countries aged 12.5–17.5 years re - ported plasma α - tocopherol average concentrations of 9.9 ± 2.1 μg/mL (equivalent to 23.0 ± 4.9 μmol/L).Deficient plasma α- tocopherol concentrations (< 12 μmol/L) were identified in only 5% of the population (Moreno et al., 2014 ).Older adults To evaluate α - tocopherol pharmacokinetics in younger (mean ± SD age: 32 ± 7 year; n = 12 women and 9 men) and older (aged 67 ± 8 year; n = 8 women and 12 men) adults, participants consumed deuterium- labelled collard greens (Zhu et al., 2022 ).
Baseline plasma α - tocopherol concentrations were higher in older [28.3 ± 1 1.7 μmol/L (women), 24.8 ± 8.6 (men)] than younger [18.7 ± 4.8 μmol/L (women), 21.6 ± 5.7 (men)]) participants, as were total cholesterol concentrations. However, there were no differences in time of maximum plasma- labelled α - tocopherol concentrations, half- lives or estimated absorp - tion between genders, or between ages.A similar lack of effect of age on pharmacokinetic parameters were also reported in 10 men (aged 20–75 years), using 30 mg each d6- RRR- α- and d2- g- tocopheryl acetates (Brigelius- Flohé et al., 2004 ).In the Lifelines- MINUTHE study, urine and plasma samples were collected from 1519 participants (60–75 years, males: 50%) for the assessments of urinary α - and γ- CEHC/creatinine ratios and 24 h urinary excretions of α - and γ- CEHC, plasma α- and γ- tocopherols, along with dietary ‘vitamin E’ assessment.
Plasma α- tocopherol was positively correlated with 24- h urinary excretion of α - CEHC. Dietary ‘vitamin E’ intake (expressed as α - TE) was positively correlated with the sum of 24- h urinary α - and γ- CEHC excretions (Zhu et al., 2022 ).The panel notes that data on the maturation of the mechanisms involved in α- tocopherol absorption, metabolism and ex - cretion during infancy are limited.Collectively, available data in humans and animals suggest that these mechanisms develop quickly after birth and are fully developed within the first months of life.The panel also notes that available data do not indicate an effect of age on α - tocopherol pharmacokinetics.Little information is available concerning vitamin E catabolism during aging.3.2.4.2 | Interactions with vitamin K Studies in animals have shown that high dietary α - tocopherol can lead to impaired coagulation (Frank et al., 1997 ).
Specifically, fatal haemorrhaging was associated with excess dietary vitamin E (Takahashi et al., 1990 ) and was prevented with vitamin K supplementation (Frank et al., 1997 ). In rat experiments, a reduction of phylloquinone and menaquinone- 4 (MK- 4) concen - trations in extra- hepatic tissues was found in animals administered excess α - tocopherol via diets or subcutaneous injection, compared to controls (Tovar et al., 2006 ).In healthy humans, high- dose α - tocopherol supplements (1000 mg/day RRR - α- tocopherol) for 12 weeks increased concentrations of Proteins Induced by Vitamin K Absence (PIVKA- II, the inactive under- γ- carboxylated forms of prothrombin) to concentrations indicative of poor vitamin K status (Booth et al., 2004 ).Both α- tocopherol and phylloquinone (vitamin K1) are fat- soluble vitamins and share similar side chains.The two vitamins undergo some common processes at the level of intestinal absorption, transport, catabolism and excretion.
Specifically, data suggest that the intestinal cholesterol transporter NPC1L1, which is involved in α- tocopherol absorption ( Section 3.3.1 ), also mediates the absorption of vitamin K (Takada et al., 2015 ). Both vitamins are delivered to the liver in chylomicrons, where α - TTP mediates the secretion of α - tocopherol into the plasma (triglyceride- rich fractions) for distribution to tissues.No similar proteins facilitate hepatic vitamin K secretion (Hagstrom et al., 1995 ).Hepatic catabolism of the vitamins involves similar xe - nobiotic processes including: (1) phase I enzymes, or cytochrome P450s (CYP 4F2), responsible for their omega- oxidation; (2) phase II enzymes responsible for their conjugation to enhance water solubility; and (3) phase III transporters responsible for their movement into and out of tissues and their excretion in the bile or urine.
Further, the first step in the catabolism of both vitamins involves their ω- hydroxylation by the phase I enzyme human CYP4F2 (McDonald et al., 2009 ; Sontag & Parker, 2002 ), then they are catabolised to tail- shortened, carboxy- compounds (Birringer et al., 2002 ; Harrington et al., 2005 ). Low vitamin K status is prevalent in Western populations.In a nationally representative sample of 1 154 British individuals aged 19–64 years from the 2000–1 National Diet and Nutrition Survey (Thane et al., 2006 ), plasma phylloquinone concen - tration ranged from ≤ 0.04 to 18.61 nmol/L, with a lower maximum of 13.25 nmol/L in men.‘Sub- optimal’ plasma phylloqui - none concentrations, defined as < 0.33 nmol/L, were found in 13% of participants, with a higher prevalence among women | 19 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E than men (17% vs.8%) and 2% of the participants had concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (0.02 nmol/L).
In the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis in the US, 25% participants had nearly undetectable serum phylloquinone con - centrations (< 0.1 nmol/L) (Shea et al., 2013 ). The Panel notes that excess intake of α - tocopherol (and other tocochromanols) may affect vitamin K status.3.2.4.3 | Genetics Mutations in the TTPA gene, which codes for α - TTP , cause a rare familial disorder known as ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency (AVED) (EFSA NDA Panel, 2015 ).Absorption and vascular transport of α - tocopherol are normal in these pa - tients, whereas its release from the liver into circulation is defective, resulting in low plasma α - tocopherol concentrations and inadequate distribution of the vitamin to peripheral tissues.Concerns regarding this condition relate to vitamin E insufficiency rather than excess.
Genetic variations in TTPA in persons among participants of the Alpha- Tocopherol, Beta- Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) trial only modestly affected serum α - tocopherol (Wright et al., 2009 ). Other α- tocopherol binding proteins have been identified in humans.These include the tocopherol associated pro - tein (TAPs), namely TAP1/SEC14- like 2 protein (SEC14L2; synonymously, supernatant protein factor, SPF), TAP2/SEC14L3 and TAP3/SEC14L4.However, current knowledge on the role of these proteins and their physiological relevance is limited.In silico search for single nucleotide polymorphisms found few polymorphisms in genes coding for these proteins, suggest - ing that they are unlikely to be critical factors of heterogeneity in the effects of α - tocopherol (Döring et al., 2004 ).
The CRAL- TRIO motif is common to several lipid- binding proteins including cellular retinaldehyde binding protein (CRALBP), α- TTP , yeast phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (Sec14p) and SPF; however, based on ligand affinity constant, only α - TTP is likely to serve as the physiological mediator of the biological activity of α - tocopherol (Panagabko et al., 2003 ). Proteins involved in drug/lipid metabolism (e.g.members of the cytochrome P450 family, lipoprotein lipase) are more likely to in - fluence inter- individual variation in responses to α- tocopherol intake.Polymorphisms in the CYP4F2 gene have also been reported (Caldwell et al., 2008 ; Chen et al., 2016 ; McDonald et al., 2009 ).Genome- wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic polymorphisms associated with differential responses to vitamin E supplementation (Major et al., 2011 ; Major et al., 2012 ; Major et al., 2014 ; Xu et al., 2022 ).
However, at present, data are lacking on whether specific polymor - phisms may be important determinants for the adverse effects of excess vitamin E intake. There are also reported differences in the catabolism of tocochromanols between males and females (Frank et al., 2008 ; Kalsotra et al., 2002 ; Traber et al., 2017 ; Zhu et al., 2022 ).However, their relevance in terms of the health effects of the vitamin requires further investigation.Mechanistic studies show that NPC1L1 is involved in tocopherol absorption (Section 3.2.2 ).NPC1 defects cause a neu - rodegenerative disease, including ataxia.However, humans with NPC1 defects did not have altered plasma tocopherol or cholesterol levels, but elevated lysosomal storage of both was observed (Lee & Hong, 2023 ; Ulatowski et al., 2011 ).
The Panel considers that further research is needed regarding polymorphisms in genes involved in α - tocopherol ab - sorption, distribution, metabolism and functions and their impacts on health and adverse effects of excess vitamin E intake. 3.2.4.4 | Specific conditions causing vitamin E deficiency Some disorders such as AVED ( Section 3.2.4.3 ) (Traber & Head, 2021 ), genetic defects in lipoprotein metabolism (Bredefeld et al., 2022 ; Zamel et al., 2008 ), cholestatic liver disease (Sokol et al., 1983 ; Veraldi et al., 2020 ) and cystic fibrosis (Farrell et al., 1977 ) can result in vitamin E deficiency.Large α - tocopherol supplements (grams per day) are required for the treat - ment of these diseases.These patients are outside the target population of the UL for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol).
3.2.5 | Biomarkers of intake Weak correlations have been reported between dietary α - tocopherol intake and plasma/serum α - tocopherol concentrations (EFSA NDA Panel, 2015 ), but these are stronger when participants consume vitamin E supplements (Ascherio et al., 1992 ). Plasma/serum α- tocopherol concentrations appear to reach a plateau (~ 3–4 times unsupplemented concentrations) when humans consume supplements ( RRR- or all rac - α- tocopherol) containing ≥ 200 mg (465 μmol)/day (IOM, 2001 ).There are no established reference ranges or cut- offs of plasma/serum α - tocopherol concentrations associated with adverse effects.However, elevated serum α - tocopherol levels were reported in some patients with intracerebral haemorrhages that were suspected to be caused by the consumption of α - tocopherol supplements (Le et al., 2020 ).
As circulating α - tocopherol is associated with lipoproteins ( Section 3.2.3 ), plasma/serum α - tocopherol concentrations are influenced by factors affecting plasma lipid concentrations (especially cholesterol), such as age, sex and lipid- lowering drugs. In adults, blood α - tocopherol concentrations have been found to increase with age (Ford et al., 2006 ), similar to the in - crease in blood cholesterol concentration (Downer et al., 2014 ).Reduced plasma α - tocopherol concentrations are reported in subjects taking cholesterol lowering drugs (statins) (Schmölz et al., 2016 ) and plant sterols and stanols (Baumgartner et al., 2017 ), but concentrations are similar between treated and untreated subjects once standardised for total cholesterol concentration.In a study on the fate of deuterium- labelled α - tocopherol from collard greens in younger and older adults, α - tocopherol half- lives were correlated with serum lipids (Traber et al., 2015 ).
Serum lipids were 15% higher in the older group than in the younger group, while plasma α - tocopherol concentrations were 25% higher. These data suggest that plasma 20 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E α- tocopherol concentrations are more dependent on mechanisms that control lipoprotein metabolism and emphasise that vitamin E status cannot be assessed by using plasma α - tocopherol concentrations only.Other factors such as smoking and disease states associated with changes in α - tocopherol status can also affect plasma α - tocopherol concentrations.Serum and urinary α - CEHC concentrations are sensitive to α - tocopherol supplementation (Huang et al., 2020 ; Mondul et al., 2016 ).Supplementation with 800 IU RRR- α- tocopherol (400 IU twice a day with meals) resulted in a 20- fold increase in α- CEHC, while serum α - tocopherol increased by 2.5- fold (Bartolini et al., 2021 ).
In an experiment involving healthy, male Japanese college students (aged 18–25 years), the excretory percentage as α - CEHC was 3.7 ± 1.3, 2.3 ± 0.7 , 2.3 ± 1.1 and 2.3 ± 0.6% for α- tocopherol intakes of 20, 41, 83 and 146 μmol/day, respectively (Imai et al., 2011 ). Overall, limited quanti - tative information is available on the relationship between urinary α - CEHC excretion and α - tocopherol intake and body pools, and its use has been limited to date.3.3 | Intake assessment 3.3.1 | Source of dietary α - tocopherol Natural sources The highest contents of α - tocopherol are found in vegetable oils.Among other plant products, nuts and seeds are the richest sources, while smaller amounts are found in fruits and vegetables (Kornsteiner et al., 2006 ).Among animal products, some fatty fishes and eggs are the richest sources of α - tocopherol (Afonso et al., 2016 ).Meat and dairy products typically contain low amounts of α - tocopherol (Leonhardt et al., 1997 ).
National surveys indicate that mean α - tocopherol intakes in adults are higher in European countries (Amcoff et al., 2012 ; Helldan et al., 2013 ) than those observed in the USA (Mahabir et al., 2008 ; Signorello et al., 2010 ; Yang, Wang, Davis, Lee, Fernandez, Koo, Cho, & Chun, 2014 ; Yang, Wang, Davis, Lee, Fernandez, Koo, Cho, Song, & Chun, 2014 ), where γ - tocopherol is the most abundant tocopherol in the diet. Food additives Synthetic (all rac- ) α- tocopherol is an authorised antioxidant, included in Group I of the Union list of food additives and labelled E 307.19 Tocopherol- rich extract of natural origin (E 306), synthetic γ - tocopherol (E 308) and synthetic δ - tocopherol (E 309) are also authorised additives.Tocopherols (E 306- E 309) can be added quantum satis20 to 68 food categories.
Maximum levels (MLs) have been established for ‘refined olive oils, including olive pomace oil’ (ML = 200 mg/L), and for ‘food for infants and young children’, at an amount of 10 or 100 mg/kg, depending on the specific category. In the EU, α- tocopherol is the predominant tocopherol used by the food industry (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015 ).Fortified foods and food supplements The Mintel GNPD was used to extract information about fortified food and food supplements on the EU market.Forms of vitamin E authorised for addition to foods and food supplements in the EU are presented in Table 4.When labels did not allow to ascertain that the ‘vitamin E’ content reported referred to α - tocopherol only, or the actual amount was unclear, products were excluded ( Section 3.3.1 ).Fortified foods Currently, there are no mandatory fortification policies for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol) in the EU.The vitamin may be volun - tarily added to foods (i.e.at the discretion of the manufacturer).
EU legislation sets minimum and maximum content of α- tocopherol in infant and follow- on formulae (0.6–5 mg/100 kcal),21 and in baby foods and processed cereal- based foods for infants and children (maximum limit = 3 mg α - TE/100 kcal).22 In the Mintel GNPD, a total of 1737 packaged food products available in 24 EU Member States and Norway were identi - fied as containing added α - tocopherol. The majority of the products belonged to the Mintel categories ‘juice drinks’ (43%), ‘dairy’ (15%, includes dairy alternatives), ‘nutritional drinks and other beverages’ (9%), ‘sugar, gum and chocolate confec - tionery & sugar and sweeteners (9 %), ‘snacks' (8 %) and ‘sports & energy drinks' (7%).19Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives.OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p.

Food supplements In the Mintel GNPD, a total of 1 159 food supplements available in 24 EU Member States and Norway were identified as con - taining α- tocopherol. The median dose declared on labels was 12 mg/serving.23 About 95% of supplements contained doses ≤ 30 mg per serving, and about 2% ( n = 18) had doses > 100 mg per serving, with a maximum of 294 mg per serving ( Figure 4).3.3.2 | EFSA's intake assessment The intakes of α - tocopherol from food sources (excluding food supplements) in European populations were calculated in the context of the scientific opinion on DRVs for Vitamin E as α - tocopherol (EFSA NDA Panel, 2015 ).Estimates were based on the data from the EFSA Comprehensive Database and the EFSA FCDB ( Section 2.3 ).The intake assessment did not distinguish between α- tocopherol ‘naturally present’ or ‘added’ to foods by manufactur - ers.No cleaning strategy was applied to exclude the contribution of fortified foods or food additives.
Given the scarcity of data on the consumption of foods fortified with α - tocopherol available in the Comprehensive Database24 and on the con - centration of α - tocopherol in fortified foods available in the FCDB, the contribution of fortified foods to the intake esti - mates is expected to be low. In contrast, α - tocopherol is widely used as an additive (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015 ).As the analytical methods used to compile the FCDB cannot differentiate between α - tocopherol used as a food additive and the natural content in foods, the Panel notes that the EFSA's estimates can be considered to reflect the combined intake of α- tocopherol naturally present in foods and used as food additive across EU countries.
However, the relative contribution of additives to the total estimates cannot be calculated based on available data, and there are uncertainties with respect to the represen - tativeness of the composition data regarding the actual use of α - tocopherol as a food additive, which likely results in an underestimation of the actual exposure (see Section 3.3.2.3 ). α- tocopherol intake is the major contributor to α - TEs intake in EU countries (EFSA NDA Panel, 2015 ).Given the scarcity of data regarding α- tocopherol only and related uncertainties (see below), estimates expressed in mg α - TEs/day are reported as well.23The Mintel GNPD provides data on the content of supplements per serving which may not always reflect the daily dose recommended by the manufacturer.24Indicatively, 2.4% of the overall eating occasions reported a fortification descriptor (e.g.
‘F09.Fortification agent’) in the latest version of the Comprehensive Database (updated in December 2022), of which 0.8% report a vitamin E/ α- tocopherol- related fortification descriptor, for foods such as multivitamin juices and soft drinks, margarines and other vegetable fats and oils and biscuits.FIGURE 4 Distribution of vitamin E ( α- tocopherol) content in food supplements as displayed on labels in EU Member States and Norway.

Among countries which provided data to compile the EFSA FCDB, only two provided data on α - tocopherol content in foods, while the others provided data on α- TE, i.e. included other tocopherols and tocotrienols.The definition of α - TE and the conversion factors applied to the other tocochromanols were not reported.In addition, when compiler countries had data gaps, i.e.missing content values for certain foods, they sub - stantially borrowed α - tocopherol and α- TE values from the food composition databases of other countries ( Section 2.3.1.1 ).This may have resulted in an overestimation of α - tocopherol intake and an underestimation of α - TE.Overall, the estimates indicate that α - tocopherol is the largest contributor to α - TEs.This is consistent with evidence from the literature indicating that α- tocopherol is the most abundant form of tocochromanols present in foods consumed in Europe ( Section 3.3.1 ).

cCalculated only from one survey.TABLE 5 (Continued) | 25 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E Concerning the inclusion of α - tocopherol used as food additive in the intake estimates, the Panel notes that the com - position data used, which dated 2012 or earlier, might not reflect the latest trends in additive uses (i.e. some analytical data may relate to products which are not anymore representative of current market).In addition, content values of certain foods estimated through recipe calculations do not necessarily reflect food additive uses.Thus, the contribution of α - tocopherol used as food additive is likely to be underestimated.In 2015, the ANS Panel re- evaluated the safety of tocopherols as food additives (E 306- E 309) (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015 ).As α - tocopherol is the predominant tocopherol used by the EU food industry, it was the only form considered for the exposure assessment.The standard approach for additives exposure assessment was applied.
Different scenarios were performed, based on maximum regulatory levels, or use levels provided by manufacturers and occurrence data provided by Member States. Applying the refined non- brand- loyal exposure scenario (including loss factors), the resulting P95 estimates of the exposure to α - tocopherol as a food additive (E 307) were 1.1–3.5 mg/kg bw per day in infants, 3.5–5.9 mg/day in toddlers, 2.8–5.2 mg/kg bw day in children, 0.9–3.4 mg/kg bw per day in adolescents, 1.0–2.6 mg/kg bw day in adults and 1.0–1.7 mg/kg bw per day in the elderly.Meat products were the most important contributor to the estimates.The ANS Panel noted that several conservative assumptions were applied for these calculations and that these estimates were likely to overestimate the actual exposure to α - tocopherol from its use as a food additive (E 307).
3.3.3 | Complementary information The following paragraphs summarise key information on intake from natural food sources, fortified foods and food supple - ments, available in national survey reports or other scientific publications collected from national competent authorities, as described in Section 2.3.1 . Data on ‘vitamin E’ intake were collected from 32 nationally representative consumption surveys (22 countries) ( Section 2.3.1.2 ).Data collected were heterogeneous in terms of how ‘vitamin E’ intake was expressed in the different national reports.Additional information on the survey characteristics, the equations used to express intake as α - TE in the different na - tional surveys, and the mean and P95 intake estimates, are presented in Annex D .
3.3.3.1 | Data on intake excluding food supplements Intake estimates from national food consumption surveys From the 32 surveys providing data on the intake of α - tocopherol or α- TE, one has not reported the intake from natural sources, while 23 have also included fortified foods (Annex D ). However, most of the survey reports did not distinguish between these two sources.For surveys that did not clearly indicate whether fortified foods were included/excluded in the estimates, or for which no clarification has been provided when requested, it is assumed that they were not excluded.Data on α - tocopherol intake only were reported in 17 surveys (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Portugal and Sweden), while 15 have reported intakes expressed in α - TE (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Spain).
For those providing data expressed in α - TE, there was some heterogeneity across countries/surveys regarding the conversion factors applied to each tocochromanol (Annex D ). The highest P95 intake estimates from foods excluding food supplements were reported for infants (< 1 years) in Spain (males, 14.2 mg/day), for toddlers (≥ 1 to < 3 years) in Bulgaria (males and females, 18.4 mg/day), for children (≥ 3 to < 10 years) in Bulgaria (males and females, 24.1 mg/day), for adolescents (≥ 10 to < 18 years) in Germany (males, 32.7 mg/day), for adults (≥ 18 to < 65 years) in Austria (males, 32.7 mg/day) and for older adults (≥ 65 years) in Sweden (females, 38.4 mg/day).With the exception of Sweden, estimated intakes for females were generally lower than for males in all surveys and age groups.Contribution of fortified foods to α- tocopherol intake Data on the contribution of fortified foods to the total ‘vitamin E’ intake in EU countries are scarce.
Estimates were avail - able from two national surveys conducted in Belgium and the Netherlands. Moyersoen et al.( 2017 ) reported that, in Belgium, voluntary fortification with ‘vitamin E’ is most commonly used in milk (1.8–2.4 mg/100 g), ‘growing- up milk’ (0.83–1.1 mg/100 g), milk substitutes (1.4–1.85 mg/100 g), margarines and spreadable fats (9.1–34 mg/100 g), cereals (10 mg/100 g), biscuits (3.6–7.2 mg/100 g), fruit juices and lemonades (0.9–6 mg/100 g), cacao powder (12–15.8 mg/100 g) and weight- loss products (3.3–19 mg/100 g).According to Moyersoen et al.( 2017 ), the contribution to total ‘vitamin E’ intake from fortified foods was highest in children 3–6 years of age (15.2% in boys and 1 1.8% in girls), and generally decreasing with increasing age.
Data from the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey (DNFCS) 2012–2016 ( n = 4313, 1–79 years) indicate that foods fortified with ‘vitamin E’ are frequently consumed in the Netherlands (39% of the recall days) (de Jong et al., 2022 ). Among consumers, the median contribution (P5- P95) of fortified foods to total intake of ‘vitamin E’ was 20.8% (1.2%–70.2%).For the population < 18 years old, esti - mated intake (median (P5- P95)) were 1 1.2 (5.5–19.8) mg/day for boys, and 9.4 (5.2–15.1) mg/day for girls among consum - ers of ‘vitamin E’ fortified foods, and 8.0 (3.8–14.1) mg/day for boys and 8.7 (4.0–16.6) mg/day for girls among non- consumers.
Among adults (≥ 18 years old), estimated intakes (median (P5- P95)) among consumers were 14.9 26 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E (8.9–24.0) mg/day for men and 10.9 (6.7–17.3) mg/day for women; among non- consumers, estimates were 12.6 (7.0–22.2) mg/day for men and 9.9 (5.5–16.6) mg/day for women.26 3.3.3.2 | Data on intake including food supplements A total of 17 dietary surveys conducted in 1 1 countries (Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal and Sweden) reported information on ‘vitamin E’ supplementation in whole survey populations or in a cohort of supplement users only, of which 12 surveys presented intake data resulting from food supple - ments only. Vitamin E forms used in food supplements were not reported in any of the data sources.Survey characteristics and intake estimates are presented in Annex D .
Data from national surveys among ‘vitamin E’ supplement users were available for seven countries and are presented in Tables 7 and 8 . Among users between 1 and < 18 years of age, absolute ‘vitamin E’ intakes from food supplements in high consumers (P95) have been calculated in three countries, and ranged from 8 mg/day in toddlers in Norway (2 years old, sex- aggregated results) to 22 mg/day in male adolescents in Norway (13 years old) ( Table 7).The highest median contribution of food supplements to total ‘vitamin E’ intake (59%) was reported among Danish adolescent females (1 1–17 years).Among adult supplements users, the highest absolute ‘vitamin E’ intake (P95) from food supplements was reported in Germany (133.2 in men and 221.3 in women mg/day), where total ‘vitamin E’ intakes in high consumers (P95) in the same survey (whole survey population) ranged between 183.9 mg/day in men and 234.1 mg/day in women ( Table 8).
Percent contribution of supplements to total ‘vitamin E’ intake was provided only by three countries (Belgium, Denmark and Ireland). The highest contribution intake was reported for the Danish adult population, ranging from 57% among males with 18–50 years of age to 70% among females aged 51–75 years (P95 intakes of total ‘vitamin E’: 43–53 mg/day).26Data was extracted from de Jong et al., 2022 using WebPlotDigitizer 4.7, https:// apps.autom eris.io/ wpd/ .TABLE 7 Percent ‘vitamin E’ supplement users in EU surveys and α - tocopherol intake from food supplements among users (toddlers, children and adolescents).

By default, multivitamin/mineral supplements were considered to contain retinol based on Danish households’ purchases data.| 27 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E 3.3.4 | Overall conclusions on intake data Due to the evolution of the definition of ‘vitamin E’, the Panel notes that food composition data are not harmonised and sometimes ambiguous as to whether the ‘vitamin E’ content reported refers to α - tocopherol only or include all tocochro - manols.The lack of harmonisation regarding product labelling introduces further uncertainties.This could lead to an over - estimation of the actual α - tocopherol content of food and resulting intake estimates.In contrast, intake estimate of α- TE is likely to be underestimated.Thus, both intake estimates of α - tocopherol and α- TE were presented in this Section.
The Panel notes that the P95 estimated dietary intake of α - tocopherol (excluding food supplements) across surveys in - cluded in EFSA's intake assessment were higher among females < 10 years with intakes up to 8.9 mg/day in infants (≥ 4 to < 12 months), up to 9.6 mg/day in toddlers (≥ 1 to < 3 years) and up to 19.6 mg/day in children (≥ 3 to < 10 years). Among adolescents (≥ 10 to < 18 years), the highest values were found among males, up to an intake of 29.0 mg/day in adolescents.Estimates in adults were up to 28.5 mg/day among males.The maximum P95 for pregnant women was 21.2 mg/day ( Table 5) (Annex C ).The highest contributors to the total α - tocopherol intake were vegetable fats and oils, grains and grain- based products and the sum of fruits, vegetables and derived products.The Panel notes that a fraction of the intake estimates comes from the use of α- tocopherol as food additive.
However, available data do not allow to distinguish between the natural α - tocopherol con - tent of food and its use as food additive and the contribution of food additives is likely to be underestimated.TABLE 8 Percent ‘vitamin E’ supplement users in EU surveys and α - tocopherol intake from food supplements among users (≥ 18 years: Adults, elderly and very elderly).

Regarding food supplements containing added α- tocopherol, a total of 1 159 products available in 24 EU Member States and Norway were identified from the Mintel GNP database. The majority of supplements contained up to 15 mg per serv - ing, and about 2% had doses > 100 mg per serving, with a maximum of 294 mg per serving.Data on α - tocopherol intake from fortified foods and food supplements in EU populations are scarce.Available data from Belgium and the Netherlands indicate that fortified foods represented 15%–20% (average) and up to 70% (P95) of total α- tocopherol intake among consumers of those products.Among users of food supplements, the mean contribution of food supplements to total α - tocopherol intake ranged between about 3.5% and 70% in adults (data from 3 countries) and between about 2.2% and 59% in children and adolescents (data from 3 countries).
The Panel notes that in regular consumers of α - tocopherol containing fortified foods and food supplements, the contribution of these foods to total α- tocopherol intake can be substantial. 3.4 | Hazard identification 3.4.1 | Impaired blood coagulation and risk of bleeding 3.4.1.1 | Introduction and mechanisms of toxicity It is well established that high doses of α - tocopherol increase the risk of bleeding, as observed in animal studies (Abdo et al., 1986 ; EFSA ANS Panel, 2015 ; Frank et al., 1997 ; Helson, 1984 ; March et al., 1973 ; Takahashi et al., 1990 ; Wheldon et al., 1983 ; Woolley, 1945 ).An increased risk of haemorrhage and prolonged prothrombin times (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT) have been observed upon oral administration of high doses α - tocopherol to chicks, rodents and mini- pigs (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015 ; IOM, 2001 ).
In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo data suggest that the mechanisms by which α- tocopherol could impair blood clotting could be similar in animals and humans. Briefly, blood clot formation to stop bleeding (haemostasis) from an injured blood vessel arises from a complex series of cellular and biochemical events, which, when dysregulated, predispose to an increased risk of thrombosis or bleed - ing.Endothelial cells in the vascular wall, circulating platelets and coagulation factors are involved (O'Donnell et al., 2019 ).Platelet adhesion, secretion and aggregation are essential in primary homeostasis.Antiplatelet medications (e.g.aspirin, clopidogel) target one or more of these, are prescribed in prothrombotic states and increase the risk of bleeding.Most coagulation factors circulate in an inactive form and are synthesised by the liver (Palta et al., 2014 ).
Factors II, VII, IX and X undergo a post- translational, vitamin K- dependent γ - carboxylation of glutamic acid residues that enables them to partic - ipate in the clotting cascade (EFSA NDA Panel, 2017 ). Vitamin K deficiency and vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants (e.g.warfarin) also increase the risk of bleeding (Palta et al., 2014 ).Different mechanisms have been proposed by which high α - tocopherol intakes could increase the risk of bleeding in humans.First, α - tocopherol appears to impair vitamin K absorption, hepatic metabolism and status ( Section 3.2.4 ).In animals, fatal haemorrhages associated with excess dietary α - tocopherol were prevented with vitamin K supplementation (Frank et al., 1997 ; Helson, 1984 ; Wheldon et al., 1983 ).In rat experiments, a reduction of phylloquinone and MK- 4 concen - trations in extra- hepatic tissues was found in animals administered excess α - tocopherol via diet or subcutaneous injection, compared to controls (Tovar et al., 2006 ).
In healthy humans, high- dose α - tocopherol supplements (1000 mg/day RRR - α- tocopherol) for 12 weeks increased concentrations of the inactive under- γ- carboxylated forms of prothrombin (PIVKA- II) to levels indicative of poor vitamin K status (Booth et al., 2004 ). Second, α - tocopherol has been found to inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro (Kakishita et al., 1990 ; Srivastava, 1986 ) and reduced platelet adhesion has been observed in individ - uals taking α- tocopherol supplements (Jandak et al., 1989 ; Steiner, 1983 ).The exact mechanism for the effect is unknown but is thought to be mediated by the inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC), a major regulator of platelet granule secretion, integrin activation and platelet aggregation (Freedman et al., 1996 ; Steiner, 1999 ).Finally, α- tocopherol at high doses could potentiate the effect of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications through different mechanisms (Podszun & Frank, 2014 ).
In this context, the SCF considered the effect of α- tocopherol on blood clotting as the critical endpoint to derive a UL for vitamin E (SCF, 2003 ). The value was based on the RCT by Meydani et al.( 1998 ), where no adverse effects and no change in bleeding time (as surrogate measure for blood clotting) were observed in individuals supplemented with a daily dose of 800 IU all rac - α- tocopherol acetate for 4 months.The aim of the current systematic review was to evaluate whether new evidence from human intervention studies al - lows a characterisation of the dose–response relationship between α - tocopherol intake and impaired blood coagulation in humans.Eligible endpoints were bleeding events, bleeding time and blood coagulation parameters.A common system - atic search was performed for all endpoints because the inclusion/exclusion criteria were identical for all endpoints and some studies could report on more than one endpoint.
Studies among individuals receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs, and studies which selected patients with medical conditions or on treatments that affect blood coagulation or with | 29 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E vitamin K malabsorption syndromes, were not eligible (Annex A ). These individuals are outside of the target population of the UL for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol) ( Section 1.3).The Panel notes that all the intervention studies retrieved through the systematic search which reported on the effect of α- tocopherol supplementation on bleeding events (e.g.epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, haematuria, gingival bleeding, bruising) involved participants on aspirin (either a proportion or all study participants) or exposed to other agents which could increase the risk of epistaxis (i.e.the medicine isotretinoin; high air pollution).
No stratified analyses were provided in the papers which could allow assessing an independent effect of α - tocopherol on the risk of bleeding. The complete list of publications and the reasons for exclusion are in Annex E .One case report of ‘vitamin E toxicity- related coagulopathy’ was also identified, in which the patient reported sporadic use of ibuprofen (400 mg) for back pain (Abrol et al., 2023 ).The Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from these publications to derive a UL for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol).Among the 13 intervention studies that met the inclusion criteria, three report on bleeding time, five on PT, four on aPTT, two on platelet adhesion and 10 on platelet aggregation.Four studies report on two or more of these endpoints.The evidence table can be found in Appendix B.1 .3.4.1.2 | Bleeding time Three human intervention studies investigated the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on measures of bleeding time.
Two were RCTs (Meydani et al., 1998 ; Stampfer et al., 1988 ) and one was an uncontrolled before–after study (Dereska et al., 2006 ). The RCT by Meydani et al.( 1998 ), previously assessed by the SCF, investigated the effect of α - tocopherol supplementa - tion for 4 months on bleeding time.Participants were 88 men and women aged ≥ 65 years, non- smokers, with no known medical illnesses and were not taking prescription medications or dietary supplements.Participants were randomised to placebo ( n = 22) or 60 ( n = 22), 200 ( n = 25) or 800 ( n = 19) IU/day of all rac - α- tocopherol (55, 182, 728 mg/day α - tocopherol).Post- intervention plasma α- tocopherol concentrations (mean ± SD) were 23.3 ± 2.2 μmol/L in the placebo group; 38.4 ± 5.3, 51.0 ± 13.6, 71.5 ± 26.5 μmol/L in the respective supplement groups.Bleeding time was assessed using Simplate II.
A total of 10 subjects (2, 3, 5 and none in the placebo, low- , medium- and high- dose α - tocopherol groups, respectively) dropped from the study for personal reasons, sickness unrelated to the study or non- compliance (Meydani et al., 1997 ). Among completers, bleeding time was available for 15–19 participants per group at all time points (exact number per group not given).Bleeding times were similar in all groups pre- (mean ± SD; placebo: 302 ± 97 s, 60 IU: 310 ± 78 s, 200 IU: 331 ± 68 s, 800 IU: 310 ± 89 s) and post- supplementation (placebo: 263 ± 77 s, 60 IU: 345 ± 94 s, 200 IU: 293 ± 64 s, 800 IU: 288 ± 72 s).The authors report that the vitamin K status was ‘normal’ (indices not reported).The RCT by Stampfer et al.( 1988 ) investigated the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation for 5 weeks on bleeding time in 10 men and 10 women (age not reported).
Subjects were eligible if they did not use aspirin or other platelet active agents for 2 weeks before inclusion and throughout the study and were randomly assigned to 800 IU/day all rac - α- tocopherol27 (728 mg/day α - tocopherol) or matching placebo. Compared to baseline values, supplementation resulted in a threefold increase in plasma α - tocopherol (mean, range; post- supplementation: 70, 28–1 14 μmol/mL), while no change was observed in the placebo group (post- supplementation: 26, 12–42 μmol/mL).Bleeding time was assessed twice using Simplate II (once per forearm) at each time point.There was no difference between groups in the change in bleeding time (mean ± SD; post- supplementation vs.pre- supplementation: 6.43 ± 1.86 min vs.6.73 ± 1.30 min in the supplemented group; 6.58 ± 1.49 min vs.6.28 ± 1.29 min in the control group).Dereska et al.( 2006 ) assessed the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation for 14 days on bleeding time in 20 men and 20 women (mean age 30.9 years).
Subjects were eligible if they did not use aspirin or non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for at least 2 weeks before inclusion in the study. Subjects were eligible if they were free from any history of bleeding diathesis, recent liver disease or collagen vascular disease, hypertension, history of an abnormal bleeding time, abnormally elevated or low platelet count, current pregnancy, history of vitamin E intake, anticoagulant drugs or antibiotics within 2 weeks of initial participation in the study, history of chronic antibiotic ingestion or known vitamin K deficiency.Bleeding time was assessed pre- and post- supplementation with 800 IU/day all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate (728 mg/day α - tocopherol) supplementation for 14 days, using the Dade Behring PFA- 100 instrument.Mean bleeding time post α - tocopherol supplementation (96.25 ± 23.40 seconds, range 65–168 seconds) did not differ from that of baseline (105.72 ± 31.78 seconds, range 70–179 seconds).
The Panel notes that no effect on bleeding time was found in three human intervention studies in which α - tocopherol was administered at doses of up to 728 mg/day for periods ranging from 2 weeks up to 4 months. Participants in these studies were adult men and women who were described as ‘healthy’.Their vitamin K status was reported to be adequate/ not deficient in two studies, but biochemical indices were not reported.3.4.1.3 | Coagulation parameters Several studies have investigated the effect of a- tocopherol supplementation on coagulation parameters such as PT, aPTT, measures of platelet adhesion or measures of platelet aggregation, primarily to explore the potential mechanisms by which a- tocopherol may affect blood coagulation processes ( Section 3.4.1.1 ).These data are considered supportive evidence for the main endpoints, i.e.bleeding events and bleeding times.
27Based on the conversion reported in the paper, the Panel assumes that the form of supplementation was all rac- α- tocopherol. 30 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E Five human interventions, three RCTs (Kitagawa & Mino, 1989 ; Stampfer et al., 1988 ; Tsai et al., 1978 ), one CT (Morinobu et al., 2002 ) and one uncontrolled before- after study (Dereska et al., 2006 ), investigated the effect of α - tocopherol sup - plementation on PT in adults.Four of them also measured aPTT (Dereska et al., 2006 ; Kitagawa & Mino, 1989 ; Morinobu et al., 2002 ; Stampfer et al., 1988 ).The number of participants in a treatment group ranged between 10 and 104.They were mostly young adults and were described to be ‘healthy’.Regarding vitamin K status, Kitagawa and Mino ( 1989 ) re- ported no detectable levels of PIVKA- II (< 0.5 μg/mL) among study participants, Dereska et al.
( 2006 ) excluded individuals with ‘known vitamin K deficiency’, while no information is available for the other studies. Supplementation doses ranged from 546 to 804 mg/day α- tocopherol, administered as natural or synthetic ‘free' a- tocopherol (3 studies) or synthetic α - tocopheryl acetate (2 studies), and lasted from 2 to 12 weeks.No effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on PT or aPTT was observed in any of the studies.Two studies by the same research group investigated the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on measures of plate - let adhesion in adults aged between 18 and 57 years (Jandak et al., 1989 ; Steiner, 1983 ).Participants were reported to be ‘healthy’ and abstained from medications during the study.In the first study, Steiner ( 1983 ), 47 participants (20 men and 27 women) were divided into four groups for a 6- week intervention.
Participants received either placebo ( n = 1 1), or an in - tervention ( n = 12 each group) consisting of α - tocopherol at increasing doses of 400, 800, 1200 IU/day all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate (364, 728 and 1091 mg/day α - tocopherol) for 2 weeks each, aspirin (300 mg every other day), or both α - tocopherol and aspirin at the above- mentioned doses. Ex vivo platelet adhesion to collagen was assessed weekly for the 6 weeks of the intervention.Supplementation with α - tocopherol significantly reduced platelet adhesion in a dose- dependent manner as compared to placebo, whereas aspirin alone had no effect.Platelet adhesion to collagen in the α - tocopherol plus aspirin group did not differ significantly from the α - tocopherol group in the first 3 weeks but was significantly higher thereafter.In the second study, Jandak et al.
( 1989 ), a single group of six non- smoking men and women received 200 IU/day RRR - α- tocopheryl acetate (135 mg/day α - tocopherol) for 2 weeks and 400 IU/day (270 mg/day α - tocopherol) for the subsequent 2 weeks. Ex vivo platelet adhesion to four different adhesive surfaces (glass, collagen, fibronectin and fibrinogen) was assessed at baseline and after each supplementation period.The highest decrease in platelet adhesion (all surfaces) com - pared to baseline was observed after the first dose (by 75% on average), with a modest further reduction after the second dose (by 82% on average).Differences from baseline for the 135 and 270 mg/day doses were statistically significant for all adhesive surfaces.These studies suggest a cumulative dose–response effect of α - tocopherol on platelet adhesion at daily doses between 135 and 1091 mg/day.
Two studies by the same research group investigated the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on measures of plate - let ATP secretion in apparently healthy subjects. Individuals on aspirin and other drugs interfering with platelet function were explicitly excluded (Calzada et al., 1997 ; Mabile et al., 1999 ).The first study Calzada et al.( 1997 ) was an RCT in which 40 healthy volunteers (age 20–50 years) were supplemented daily with either 300 mg all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate (273 mg α- tocopherol), vitamin C (250 mg), β - carotene (15 mg) or placebo for 8 weeks ( n = 10 per group).Secretion of ATP from dense granules by platelets stimulated with a maximal dose of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and to a lesser extent plasma concentration of β- thromboglobulin significantly decreased in the α- tocopherol (by 56% and 20% from baseline, respec - tively) as compared to placebo, whereas no significant changes were observed in the other supplementation groups.
The second study, Mabile et al. ( 1999 ), was conducted to investigate whether lower doses of α - tocopherol could exert similar effects.A single group of 22 participants consumed placebo, 75 IU, 200 IU, 400 IU RRR - α- tocopherol28 (50, 134 and 268 mg of α- tocopherol) daily for 2 weeks each in this order, for a total of 8 weeks.Secretion of ATP from dense granules by platelets stimulated with a fixed concentration of ADP (including 100% aggregation prior to supplementation) was gradually de - creased over the 6 weeks of supplementation, with significant changes from the second period of intake with 134 mg/day of α - tocopherol and up to 1.7- fold decrease at the end of the study.Nine studies investigated the effect of α- tocopherol supplementation on measures of platelet aggregation (Calzada et al., 1997 ; Dereska et al., 2006 ; Liu et al., 2003 ; Mabile et al., 1999 ; Morinobu et al., 2002 ; Silbert et al., 1990 ; Stampfer et al., 1988 ; Steiner, 1983 ; Szczeklik et al., 1985 ).
Findings among the group of individuals with hyperlipoproteinaemia in the study of Szczeklik et al. ( 1985 ) are not considered, as most had a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and no information was provided on the use of medications which could have affected platelet function.Among the remaining studies, three were RCTs (Calzada et al., 1997 ; Liu et al., 2003 ; Stampfer et al., 1988 ), one was a CT (Morinobu et al., 2002 ), one compared within group changes from baseline in the intervention versus the control group (Steiner, 1983 ) and four were before–after studies reporting within- group comparisons, of which two compared post- treatment values with those obtained after a period on placebo (Silbert et al., 1990 ; Szczeklik et al., 1985 ), and two compared post- treatment values with baseline val - ues (Dereska et al., 2006 ; Mabile et al., 1999 ).Eligible studies reported recruiting ‘healthy’ individuals.
Five studies explic - itly excluded individuals taking aspirin and other drugs that interfere with platelet function (Calzada et al., 1997 ; Dereska et al., 2006 ; Liu et al., 2003 ; Mabile et al., 1999 ; Stampfer et al., 1988 ), two studies reported that no subject was on taking any medication (Silbert et al., 1990 ; Steiner, 1983 ), one of which reported on the effect of α - tocopherol and aspirin alone and in combination, one study reported that the participants abstained from anti- inflammatory drugs (Szczeklik et al., 1985 ); group of healthy subjects) and one study did not provide information (Morinobu et al., 2002 ). Supplementation doses ranged from 50 mg/day to 1091 mg/day α - tocopherol, administered as natural or synthetic ‘free' α - tocopherol (5 studies), synthetic α- tocopheryl acetate (3 studies) or an unspecified ‘natural’ form (1 study).The intervention lasted for 2–8 weeks.
28Based on the conversion reported in the paper, the Panel assumes that the form of supplementation was RRR- α- tocopherol. | 31 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E Platelet aggregation was measured ex vivo, in response to collagen, ADP and/or arachidonic acid; one study also used epi - nephrine.Two studies also assessed the inhibition by PGE1 on platelet aggregation in response to a fixed concentration of ADP (Calzada et al., 1997 ; Mabile et al., 1999 ).Out of the nine studies identified, three reported a decrease in measures of platelet aggregation, two of which also re - ported an increased platelet sensitivity to PGE1 (Calzada et al., 1997 ; Mabile et al., 1999 ).All three have been described in de - tail above in relation to platelet adhesion (Steiner, 1983 ) or platelet secretion (Calzada et al., 1997 ; Mabile et al., 1999 ).
In the study by Steiner ( 1983 ), α- tocopherol at increasing doses of 400, 800, 1200 IU/day all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate (364, 728 and 1091 mg/day α - tocopherol) for 2 weeks each induced a modest but significant decrease in collagen- induced maximal ag - gregation in women, but not in men, who had significantly lower values at baseline. No effect was observed when epineph - rine or ADP was used as aggregating agents.Conversely, a potent antiaggregant effect was observed with aspirin alone or in combination with α - tocopherol with all three aggregating agents tested, with no differences between the groups.In the study by Calzada et al.( 1997 ), the aggregation curve with increasing doses of ADP shifted to the right with 300 mg/ day all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate (273 mg/day α - tocopherol) for 8 weeks (i.e.significantly lower platelet aggregation at each dose of ADP as compared to no supplementation), whereas no changes were observed for vitamin C or β - carotene.
Similar results were obtained by Mabile et al. ( 1999 ), where the maximum shift in the aggregation curve was already observed after 2 weeks of supplementation with the lowest dose of 75 IU RRR- α- tocopherol (50 mg/day α - tocopherol).No effect of α- tocopherol alone at similar or higher daily doses on measures of platelet aggregation was observed in the remaining stud - ies (Dereska et al., 2006 ; Liu et al., 2003 ; Morinobu et al., 2002 ; Silbert et al., 1990 ; Stampfer et al., 1988 ; Szczeklik et al., 1985 ).The aggregating agents used, the doses tested and the methods used varied widely among the studies.The Panel notes that, among individuals not taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, there are no indications of effects of α - tocopherol supplementation on PT and aPTT based on six studies, which tested doses between 546 mg/day and 804 mg/day α - tocopherol for up to 12 weeks.
Based on two studies each, the Panel notes some evidence for reduced platelet adhesion upon supplementation with α - tocopherol at doses between 135 mg/day and 1091 mg/day for 2 weeks, and on platelet ATP secretion at doses between 50 mg and 273 mg, while the evidence for an effect on platelet aggrega - tion is inconsistent, based on nine studies which tested doses up to 1091 mg day for up to 8 weeks. 3.4.1.4 | Conclusions on impaired coagulation and risk of bleeding The Panel notes that no relevant data were retrieved regarding the risk of bleeding events with α - tocopherol supplementa - tion in human intervention studies.
The Panel notes that PT and aPTT were not affected by α - tocopherol supplementation (546–804 mg/day α - tocopherol for 2–12 weeks), and that the effects observed on platelet function (mainly reduction of platelet adhesion and ATP secretion) were not translated into changes in bleeding time in three studies using doses of α- tocopherol up to 728 mg/day for up to 4 months. All the studies used to reach these conclusions were conducted in populations not taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs.
3.4.2 | Cardiovascular disease Owing to its antioxidant properties and based on observations from prospective cohort studies associating higher vitamin E dietary intake with lower risk of cardiovascular events, several RCTs have been conducted in humans aiming to investi - gate the benefit of α - tocopherol supplementation, either alone or in combination with other antioxidants, in the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis- related CVD morbidity and mortality given the involvement of oxidative stress mechanisms in their pathogenesis, among others (Vardi et al., 2013 ). Atherosclerosis- related CVDs mainly comprise coronary heart disease (CHD), including myocardial infarction and angina, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, including transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and ischaemic stroke, peripheral artery disease and aortic sclerosis.
Through the scoping searches conducted in preparation of the protocol (Annex A ), the Panel noted a higher risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) and a higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke had been reported in some α - tocopherol supple - mentation trials. The Panel decided to systematically review the available evidence for the relationship between α - tocopherol intake and the main cardiovascular endpoints investigated in α - tocopherol supplementation trials.These include morbidity and mortality related to myocardial infarction and angina, ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, CHF and composite endpoints thereof.Any potential beneficial effects of α - tocopherol on CVD will not be discussed in this opinion.Both prospective human observational and intervention studies were eligible.
According to the protocol (Annex A), studies among subjects with pre- existing conditions, taking aspirin or anticoagulant medications, which may act as mod - ifiers of any effect of α - tocopherol on CVD risk, were not excluded a priori. The results have been assessed and the gener - alisability of the findings to other groups of the general population are discussed below.The systematic review identified 32 eligible articles, reporting the results of 25 studies (15 intervention studies and 10 observational prospective studies).The flow chart is provided in Appendix A.2.Data from these studies was systematically collected and extracted in evidence tables ( Appendix B.2).Included studies reported on one or more of the cardiovascular endpoints described below.32 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E 3.4.2.1 | CVD (composite endpoint) A total of 12 RCTs assessed the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on the incidence of CVD as a composite endpoint.
Preliminary UA The number of participants ranged from 196 to 39,876 participants and the duration of the follow- up from approximately 1.5 to 10 years. The dose of α- tocopherol supplementation varied from 50 mg α - tocopheryl acetate (45 mg α- tocopherol) to 1200 IU (804 mg α - tocopherol) per day and was compared to placebo in most studies.Five trials used synthetic ( all rac- ) α- tocopherol (ATBC, SELECT, GISSI- Prevenzione, PPP; PHS II) and seven used natural ( RRR- ) α- tocopherol (HOPE/HOPE- TOO; WHS; WACS; SPACE; CHAOS; (Devaraj et al., 2007 ; Milman et al., 2008 )).The definition of CVD was heterogeneous across studies in relation to the endpoints included, but all studies included CVD mortality in the composite endpoint.None of the included RCTs reported an increased risk of CVD (morbidity and/or mortality) in the α - tocopherol group compared placebo or no α - tocopherol (i.e.
the relationship was null or negative in all the studies (Boaz et al., 2000 ; Cook et al., 2007 ; de Gaetano, 2001 ; Devaraj et al., 2007 ; GISSI – Prevenzione Investigators, 1999 ; Lee et al., 2005 ; Lippman et al., 2009 ; Lonn et al., 2005 ; Milman et al., 2008 ; Sesso et al., 2008 ; Stephens et al., 1996 ; Törnwall, Virtamo, Korhonen, Virtanen, Taylor, et al., 2004 )). In addition, five prospective observational studies were identified reporting on the relationship between α - tocopherol intake and CVD (morbidity and/or mortality) (Buijsse et al., 2008 ; Muntwyler et al., 2002 ; Pocobelli et al., 2009 ; Sheng et al., 2022 ; Stampfer et al., 1993 ).Similar to what was reported in the RCTs, α - tocopherol intake was not associated with an increased risk in any of the studies (i.e.the relationship was either null or negative).
The Panel considers that the available BoE does not suggest a positive relationship between the intake of α - tocopherol and an increased risk of CVD (composite endpoint). No comprehensive UA is performed.3.4.2.2 | Coronary heart disease Twelve RCTs investigated the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on the incidence of myocardial infarction, angina and/or CHD (i.e.composite endpoint combining myocardial infarction and angina).Preliminary UA The number of participants ranged from 161 to 39,876 participants and duration follow- up from approximately 1.5 to 10 years.The dose of α - tocopherol supplementation varied from 50 mg α - tocopheryl acetate (45 mg α - tocopherol) to 800 IU α- tocopheryl acetate (536 mg α - tocopherol) per day and was compared to placebo in most studies.
Five trials used syn - thetic ( all rac- ) α- tocopherol (ATBC, GISSI, PPP , PHS II, VEAPS) and 7 used natural ( RRR- ) α- tocopherol (HOPE, WHS, WACS, SPACE, CHAOS, (Milman et al., 2008 ; Takamatsu et al., 1995 )). Only one trial among patients with angiographically proven atherosclerosis observed a slightly higher number of fatal myocardial infarction cases in the α - tocopherol group (400–800 IU RRR - α- tocopherol/day; 268–536 mg α - tocopherol/day) compared to placebo (18 cases in 1035 randomised vs.13 cases in 967 randomised, respectively) (Stephens et al., 1996 ).
In the remaining studies, α - tocopherol supplementation did not increase the risk of myocardial infarction incidence (Boaz et al., 2000 ; Cook et al., 2007 ; de Gaetano, 2001 ; Hodis et al., 2002 ; Lee et al., 2005 ; Milman et al., 2008 ; Stephens et al., 1996 ; Takamatsu et al., 1995 ; Törnwall, Virtamo, Korhonen, Virtanen, Taylor, et al., 2004 ; Yusuf et al., 2000 ) or mortality (Boaz et al., 2000 ; Cook et al., 2007 ; Hodis et al., 2002 ; Lee et al., 2005 ; Sesso et al., 2008 ). No increased risk of angina was observed in the α - tocopherol group in any of the six trials which assessed this endpoint (Boaz et al., 2000 ; de Gaetano, 2001 ; Hodis et al., 2002 ; Sesso et al., 2008 ; Takamatsu et al., 1995 ; Yusuf et al., 2000 ).
Four trials also reported on CHD as a composite endpoint, namely on CHD incidence (Cook et al., 2007 ), CHD mortality (Törnwall, Virtamo, Korhonen, Virtanen, Taylor, et al., 2004 ; Yusuf et al., 2000 ) or CHD mortality plus non- fatal myocardial infarction combined (GISSI – Prevenzione Investigators, 1999 ). None of these trials report an increased risk of CHD in rela - tion to α - tocopherol supplementation.Additionally, four prospective observational studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified, none of which re - ported a positive association between the intake of α - tocopherol and CHD incidence or mortality (Knekt et al., 2004 ; Kushi et al., 1996 ; Muntwyler et al., 2002 ; Rimm et al., 1993 ).The Panel considers that the available BoE does not suggest a positive relationship between the intake of α - tocopherol and an increased risk of myocardial infarction, angina or CHD (composite endpoint).No comprehensive UA is performed.
3.4.2.3 | Stroke Composite endpoint A total of 12 publications reporting the results of 1 1 trials that examined the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on the incidence of stroke as a composite outcome were identified. | 33 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E Preliminary UA The sample size ranged from 100 to 39,876 participants and duration follow- up from 1.4 to 10.1 years.The dose of α- tocopherol supplementation varied from 50 to 537 mg/day and was compared with placebo in most studies.Six trials used synthetic (all rac- ) α- tocopherol (ATBC, PHS- II, GISSI, PPP , (Hodis et al., 2002 ; Steiner et al., 1995 )) and five natural ( RRR- ) α- tocopherol (HOPE/ HOPE- TOO, WHS, WACS, CHAOS and (Milman et al., 2008 )).
None of the included trials reported an adverse effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on stroke incidence (Cook et al., 2007 ; de Gaetano, 2001 ; GISSI – Prevenzione Investigators, 1999 ; Hodis et al., 2002 ; Lee et al., 2005 ; Leppälä, Virtamo, Fogelholm, Huttunen, et al., 2000 ; Lonn et al., 2005 ; Milman et al., 2008 ; Sesso et al., 2008 ; Steiner et al., 1995 ) or mortality (Leppälä, Virtamo, Fogelholm, Huttunen, et al., 2000 ) [ATBC], (GISSI – Prevenzione Investigators, 1999 ) [GISSI], (Sesso et al., 2008 ) [PHS II], (Cook et al., 2007 ) [WACS] (Stephens et al., 1996 ) [CHAOS], and (Lee et al., 2005 ) [WHS]). The results from the ATBC post- trial follow- up study are also in line with this conclusion (Törnwall, Virtamo, Korhonen, Virtanen, Albanes, & Huttunen, 2004 ).Two prospective observational studies assessing total ‘vitamin E’ intake (i.e.
considering diet and supplements) in rela - tion to the risk of stroke as a composite endpoint were also identified (Ascherio et al., 1999 ) (HPFS) and (Yochum et al., 2000 ) (WHS). Neither reported a positive association between ‘vitamin E’ intake and stroke incidence.The Panel considers that the available BoE does not suggest a positive relationship between the intake of α - tocopherol and an increased risk of stroke (composite endpoint).No comprehensive UA is performed.Ischaemic stroke The systematic literature search identified nine articles, reporting findings from seven trials, on the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on ischaemic stroke incidence (Boaz et al., 2000 ; Cook et al., 2007 ; Lee et al., 2005 ; Leppälä, Virtamo, Fogelholm, Huttunen, et al., 2000 ; Lippman et al., 2009 ; Sesso et al., 2008 ; Steiner et al., 1995 ; Törnwall, Virtamo, Korhonen, Virtanen, Albanes, & Huttunen, 2004 ; Virtamo et al., 2003 ).
Only the ATBC reported on stroke mortality (Leppälä, Virtamo, Fogelholm, Huttunen, et al., 2000 ; Virtamo et al., 2003 ). Preliminary UA The sample size ranged from 100 to 39,876 participants and study follow- up duration from 1.4 to 10.1 years.The dose of α- tocopherol supplementation varied between 50 and 360 mg/day.Four of the trials used synthetic ( all rac- ) α- tocopherol (ATBC, PHS- II, SELECT and the study by Steiner et al., 1995 ) and the remaining used natural ( RRR- ) α- tocopherol (WHS, WACS and SPACE).The risk estimates reported in the trials do not show an adverse effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on ischaemic stroke incidence or mortality.Results from the ATBC post- trial follow- up study are similar to those reported for the trial period (Törnwall, Virtamo, Korhonen, Virtanen, Albanes, & Huttunen, 2004 ).
The only observational study identified in the literature search (Ascherio et al., 1999 ) reported a null association be - tween the intake total ‘vitamin E’ intake and incidence of ischaemic stroke. The Panel considers that the available BoE does not suggest a positive relationship between the intake of α - tocopherol and an increased risk of ischaemic stroke.No comprehensive UA is performed.Haemorrhagic stroke The most common cause of haemorrhagic stroke, including intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid haem - orrhage (SAH), is hypertension.Cigarette smoking, moderate or heavy alcohol consumption, antiplatelet and anticoagu - lant medications are other important risk factors for haemorrhagic stroke.
Ten publications, reporting the results of eight trials (Leppälä, Virtamo, Fogelholm, Albanes, et al., 2000 ; Leppälä, Virtamo, Fogelholm, Huttunen, et al., 2000 ) (ATBC); (Yusuf et al., 2000 ) (HOPE); (Leppälä, Virtamo, Fogelholm, Albanes, et al., 2000 ; Leppälä, Virtamo, Fogelholm, Huttunen, et al., 2000 ; Sesso et al., 2008 ) (ATBC); (Yusuf et al., 2000 ) (HOPE); (Sesso et al., 2008 ) (PHS II); (Lee et al., 2005 ) (WHS); (Cook et al., 2007 ) (WACS); (Lippman et al., 2009 ) (SELECT); and (Steiner et al., 1995 ), PPP), investigated the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on the incidence of haemorrhagic stroke. Two RCTs also included fatal haemorrhagic stroke as an endpoint (SELECT (Lippman et al., 2009 ); ATBC (Leppälä, Virtamo, Fogelholm, Albanes, et al., 2000 ; Leppälä, Virtamo, Fogelholm, Huttunen, et al., 2000 )).Preliminary UA The evidence table can be found in Appendix B.2.
Key study characteristics, together with the effect estimates and related confidence intervals (CIs), are plotted in Figure 7. 34 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E The sample size ranged from 100 to 39,876 participants and duration follow- up from less than 2–10.1 years.The dose of α- tocopherol supplementation varied from 50 to 300 mg/day and was compared with placebo in most studies.Five trials used synthetic ( all rac- ) α- tocopherol (ATBC, PHS- II, SELECT, PPP and the study by Steiner et al., 1995 ) and three natural (RRR- ) α- tocopherol (HOPE, WHS, WACS).Virtually all trials excluded individuals on anticoagulants but included participants on aspirin, ranging from 14% (ATBC, based on the proportion of aspirin users reported in Liede et al.( 1998 ))) to 77% (PHS II and HOPE) and up to 100% (Steiner TABLE 9 Characteristics of study participants *.

| 35 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E et al., 1995 ) of the study sample ( Table 9). In three trials (WHS, PPP and Steiner et al.( 1995 ))), aspirin was part of the inter - vention.From 25% (WHS) to 75% (WACS) of participants had diagnosed hypertension at baseline.The prevalence of heart disease ranged from 0% in the WHS, based on the study's inclusion criteria, to 81% in the HOPE, where participants had been selected for being at high risk for cardiovascular events on the basis of previous CVD, diabetes and other risk factors.Supplementation with α - tocopherol increased the incidence of haemorrhagic stroke in six out of the eight included studies ( Figure 7).Similar results to those in the trial period were reported for a 6- year post- trial follow- up of the ATBC (Törnwall, Virtamo, Korhonen, Virtanen, Albanes, & Huttunen, 2004 ).
In the two trials which reported on fatal haemorrhagic stroke (SELECT and ATBC), the results were in the same direction as for the incidence of haemorrhagic stroke in both trials, with an increased risk reported in the ATBC (Leppälä, Virtamo, Fogelholm, Huttunen, et al., 2000 ), including the post- trial follow- up (Virtamo et al., 2003 ), and no increased risk reported in the SELECT (Lippman et al., 2009 ). The Panel notes that the available evidence from RCTs suggests an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke upon α - tocopherol supplementation as compared to no α - tocopherol supplementation or placebo.These studies included a high percentage of participants on secondary prevention for CVD and/or on treatment with antiplatelet medications.The Panel notes that these individuals are under medical care and that any α - tocopherol supplementation should be under medical supervision.
The Panel considers that these individuals should be excluded from the target population of a UL for vitamin E (α- tocopherol). No comprehensive UA is performed.One prospective observational study reporting on the association between total and supplemental ‘vitamin E’ intake and haemorrhagic stroke was identified (Ascherio et al., 1999 ).No association between either total or supplemental ‘vita - min E’ intake and incidence of haemorrhagic stroke was observed ( Appendix B.2 ).The Panel considers that the available evidence on the relationship between α - tocopherol supplementation and risk of haemorrhagic stroke cannot be used for establishing a UL for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol).3.4.2.4 | Congestive heart failure CHF is a complex clinical syndrome of variable aetiology that results from any structural or functional impairment of ven - tricular filling or ejection of blood.Ischaemic heart disease is a leading cause of CHF.
Five trials examined the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on the risk of CHF or mortality due to CHF (Chae et al., 2012 ; Lonn et al., 2005 ; Marchioli et al., 2006 ; Milman et al., 2008 ; Sesso et al., 2008 ). Preliminary UA The evidence table can be found in Appendix B2.Key study characteristics, together with the effect estimates and related CIs are plotted in Figure 8.The sample size ranged from 1434 to 39,815 participants and duration follow- up from 1.5 to 10.2 years.The dose of α- tocopherol supplementation varied from 400 IU all rac- α- tocopherol on alternate days (equivalent to 182 mg α - tocopherol/ day) to 300 mg all rac- α- tocopheryl acetate per day (273 mg α - tocopherol/day) and was compared with placebo in most studies.Two trials used synthetic ( all rac- ) α- tocopherol (PHS- II, GISSI- Prevenzione) and three natural ( RRR- ) α- tocopherol (HOPE/HOPE- TOO, WHS and Milman et al.( 2008 )).
In two studies, α - tocopherol supplementation increased the risk of CHF in populations with a high proportion of par - ticipants (~ 53% and 100%) who had experienced a previous myocardial infarction (HOPE/HOPE- TOO, GISSI- Prevenzione). The other three trials, which recruited populations with no or a low proportion of participants (up to ~ 15%) with a previous myocardial infarction (i.e.WHS, PHS II, Milman et al.( 2008 )), provide no evidence for an adverse effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on this endpoint.FIGURE 8 RCTs investigating the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on the incidence of congestive heart failure.GISSI, Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico; HOPE, Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation; HOPE- TOO, HOPE- The Ongoing Outcomes; PHS II, Physicians' Health Study II; WHS, Women's Health Study.
Note : Supplementation was converted to ‘free’ α - tocopherol in mg/day for all studies; doses given on alternate days were divided by 2 (column Dose converted). 36 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E The Panel notes that available evidence from RCTs suggests an increased risk of CHF upon α- tocopherol supplementa - tion following a myocardial infarction.The Panel notes that individuals at high risk of CHF (e.g.after a myocardial infarc - tion) are under medical care and that any α - tocopherol supplementation should be under medical supervision.The Panel considers that these individuals should be excluded from the target population of a UL for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol).No comprehensive UA is performed.No eligible observational study was identified.The Panel considers that the available evidence on the relationship between α - tocopherol supplementation and risk of congestive heart failure cannot be used for establishing a UL for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol).
3.4.3 | Prostate cancer Concerns about an adverse effect of α - tocopherol on the risk of prostate cancer have arisen from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention trial (SELECT) (Klein et al., 2011 ). A recent systematic review with broader inclusion criteria than those in the Protocol (Annex A ), was identified (Loh et al., 2022 ) and served as the main source of data.An additional systematic literature search was conducted, covering the period since the literature search of the systematic review was conducted.The search strategy is provided in Annex B .This literature search identified 17 articles, which report the results of four RCTs and nine observational studies.The flow chart is provided in Appendix A.3 .
3.4.3.1 | Intervention studies A total of eight publications reporting on four eligible RCTs examined the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on the risk of prostate cancer (Gaziano et al., 2009 ; Heinonen et al., 1998 ; Klein et al., 2011 ; Lippman et al., 2009 ; Lonn et al., 2005 ; Virtamo et al., 2003 ; Virtamo et al., 2014 ; Wang et al., 2014 ). The paper by Virtamo et al.( 2003 ) was retained as the primary source for the ATBC end- of- trial results, as it provided the most comprehensive report on prostate cancer risk.The paper by Heinonen et al.( 1998 ) was retained as the primary source for the prostate cancer specific mortality in the ATBC end- of- trial results.For SELECT, PHS II and ATBC, results were reported both at the end of the trial and after an additional observational follow- up period.Preliminary UA The size of the trials ranged from around 7000 to almost 18,000 participants.
One trial was conducted in the US (PHS II), one in Finland (ATBC), one in Canada, the US and Puerto Rico (SELECT), and one was an international collaboration (HOPE/HOPE- TOO). The trials included men with a mean age at baseline ranging from 57 years (ATBC) to 66 years (HOPE).Regarding other risk factors for prostate cancer, SELECT had a higher proportion of African American men, compared to the other trials.Information regarding family history of prostate cancer was not available.The evidence table is provided in Appendix B.3.Key study characteristics, together with the effect estimates and re - lated CIs are plotted in Figure 9.The figure presents the end- of- intervention results for each trial, as well as those of the follow- up observational phase, when available.FIGURE 9 RCTs investigating the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on prostate cancer risk.
ATBC, α - Tocopherol, β- Carotene Cancer Prevention Study; HOPE, Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation; HOPE- TOO, HOPE- The Ongoing Outcomes; PHS II, Physicians' Health Study II. Notes : The effect estimates are expressed as estimate (95% CI).For the studies reporting results of the post- trial follow- up, the follow- up reflects the post- trial observation period.For Klein et al., 2011 the follow- up time was estimated based on information provided in the publication.Supplementation was converted to ‘free’ α - tocopherol in mg/day for all studies; doses given on alternate days were divided by 2 (column Dose converted).| 37 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E The SELECT (Klein et al., 2011 ; Lippman et al., 2009 ) was a randomised placebo- controlled trial investigating the effect of vitamin E and selenium (alone or in combination) on prostate cancer prevention.
Men were eligible if they were ≥ 50 years old if they were African American or ≥ 55 years of age for all other race and ethnicities, did not have a prior prostate can - cer diagnosis, had a PSA in serum ≤ 4 ng/mL and a digital rectal examination (DRE) not suspicious for cancer. Participants were randomised to receive either vitamin E (400 IU/day of all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate; 364 mg α - tocopherol; n = 8737) or placebo ( n = 8696) and/or selenium for a planned intervention time of 7–12 years.Participants were also offered a free multivitamin containing no selenium or vitamin E.Prostate cancer was self- reported by the participants and in most cases subsequently confirmed by central pathology review.Following a pre- planned interim analysis, the independent data and safety monitoring committee recommended the early discontinuation of the trial because no evidence of benefit with either study agent was demonstrated.Lippman et al.
( 2009 ) evaluated the incidence of prostate cancer using data collected up to the time of study discontinuation. After a median intervention time of 5.5 years, the number of prostate cancer cases was higher in the α - tocopherol supplementa - tion versus placebo group (473 vs.416 prostate cancer cases, respectively; HR 1.13, 99% CI 0.95–1.35).Unblinded follow- up continued for an additional 32 months from the date of study termination (post- trial follow- up).In analyses accounting for this additional follow- up (54,464 additional person- years), Klein et al.( 2011 ) reported a higher number of prostate cancer cases in the α - tocopherol supplementation group, compared to the placebo diagnosed in the post- trial period (147 vs.1 13, respectively).The overall number of prostate cancer cases, covering both the trial and post- trial follow- up period, was higher in the α- tocopherol supplementation group, compared to the placebo (620 vs.
529 pros - tate cancer cases; HR 1.17 , 99% CI 1.004–1.36). In the ATBC Study, 29,133 male smokers with a smoking history averaging one pack/day for 36 years were randomised to 50 mg/day all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate (45 mg/day α - tocopherol; n = 7286) or placebo ( n = 7287) and/or β- carotene based on a 2 × 2 factorial design.The mean age of participants at baseline was 57.7 years.After randomisation volunteers were deemed ineligible ( n = 1 13) due to history of cancer or serious illness limiting long- term participation, taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A or β- carotene in excess of predefined doses, and being treated with anticoagulants.The overall dropout rate was 30.0% (29.8% in the α - tocopherol group and 30.3% in the placebo group), including deaths.Overall average compliance was 93%, with no differences observed between intervention groups (study group- specific compliance was not reported).
Cancer cases were identified through the Finnish cancer registry, and deaths from the national Register of Causes of Death. In the analyses reported in Virtamo et al.( 2003 ) reflecting the trial intervention period, 43 prostate cancer cases were reported in those receiving α - tocopherol only and 67 in those receiving placebo.The RR was 0.64 (95% CI 0.44–0.94).For the trial period, fewer prostate cancer deaths were reported for those receiving α - tocopherol compared to those who did not (23 vs.39, respectively) (Heinonen et al., 1998 ).Virtamo et al.( 2014 ) reported on the 18- year period following the ATBC termination, including 25,563 participants who were alive at the beginning of the post- trial follow- up.During the post- trial follow- up, there were 2321 incident prostate cancers.No difference in incidence was observed between those who received α - tocopherol and those who received pla - cebo (553 vs.605 prostate cancer cases; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82–1.03).
Body mass index (BMI) was reported to significantly modify the association between α - tocopherol and prostate cancer risk during the intervention and the post- trial follow- up. In men with BMI < 25 kg/m2, the RR was 1.00 (95% CI 0.78–0.98), while in those with BMI greater than 25 kg/m2 but lower than 30 kg/m2, an RR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78–0.98) was reported when comparing α - tocopherol recipients versus non- recipients.In men with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, comparing α - tocopherol recipients versus non- recipients, the RR was 1.25 (95% CI 1.01–1.55).A similar estimate was reported when the effect modification was assessed during the trial (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.67–2.26).Fewer people died of prostate cancer during the post- trial follow- up among recipients of α - tocopherol compared to non- recipients (240 deaths vs.289; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70–0.99).
The HOPE study was a 2 × 2 factorial trial of 400 IU/day RRR - α- tocopheryl acetate (268 mg/day α - tocopherol; n = 4761) versus placebo ( n = 4780), in patients at high cardiovascular event risk. Compliance among the vitamin E intervention group was 89.2% at the final study visit (median follow- up of 5.2 years).Events were reported during the follow- up visits.Supporting documentation for each event was sent to the central project office (HOPE study investigators, 1996 ).Cancer events were adjudicated by a committee, based on medical reports, clinical summaries, imaging results, serum markers and other diagnostic procedures (Lonn et al., 2005 ).A total of 235 prostate cancer cases were observed in the HOPE study.Due to the benefit reported for ramipril, the extension trial (HOPE- TOO), continued testing the potential effect of RRR - α- tocopheryl acetate (400 IU/day) versus placebo in 174 of the 267 study centres which agreed to participate.
Out of the 61 14 participants in these centres, who were alive at the start of the study extension, 4732 agreed to continue their assigned intervention ( n = 3994) or passive observation ( n = 738). A similar number of prostate cancer cases was reported for α - tocopherol recipients versus non- recipients both in the main analysis (1 16 vs.1 19 prostate cancer cases in α - tocopherol re - cipients vs.non- recipients; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.76–1.26) and the sensitivity analysis including only the HOPE- TOO participants (91 vs.101 prostate cancer cases in α - tocopherol recipients vs.non- recipients; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68–1.19).The PHS II was a 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial evaluating the effect of 400 IU all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate on alternate days (equivalent to 182 mg/day α - tocopherol; n = 7315) versus placebo ( n = 7326), and/or vitamin C, beta- carotene or a multivi - tamin in the prevention of total and prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease and age- related eye diseases (i.e.
cataracts and macular degeneration) in 14,641 male physicians (mean age 64.2 years). Participants who were taking anticoagulants were not eligible.Compliance at the end of follow- up was self- reported by the participants at 72% for the all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate group and 70% for the placebo group.Prostate cancer cases were self- reported, with the vast majority being sub - sequently confirmed by pathology or cytology reports.Rarely, a reported case of cancer was confirmed based on strong 38 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E clinical and radiological or laboratory marker evidence, when a pathology or cytology review was not conducted.During a mean follow- up of 8.0 years, 1008 prostate cancer cases were confirmed (Gaziano et al., 2009 ).Prostate cancer incidence rates were 9.1 per 1000 person years in α - tocopherol recipients, compared to 9.5 per 1000 person years in non- recipients.
The reported HR for the association between α - tocopherol and prostate cancer risk was 0.97 (95% CI 0.85–1.09). There was no association with prostate cancer death (HR 1.01, 95% 0.64–1.58).Wang et al.( 2014 ) reported on the 2.8 years (mean) of post- trial follow- up of the PHS II.A total of 356 additional prostate cancer cases were reported for the post- trial follow- up (183 in the α - tocopherol treatment group and 173 in the placebo treatment group).In the post- trial follow- up period, the HR of the association between α - tocopherol and prostate cancer risk was 1.06 (95% CI 0.86, 1.30); the HR for prostate cancer death was 1.27 (95% CI 0.78, 2.04).The Panel notes that important sources of heterogeneity exist across these trials.These sources include the chemical forms (synthetic vs.
natural) and doses of α - tocopherol used, the duration of the intervention and the criteria used to re - cruit participants, which resulted in heterogeneous study populations (in terms of ethnicity, smoking habits, health status, co- exposures to other agents, i.e. other vitamins/minerals, drugs).No meta- analysis was conducted as the number of stud - ies was too small to allow exploring the impact of these sources of heterogeneity (e.g.through stratified analysis).Overall, the Panel notes that a 13% increased risk (HR 1.13, 99% CI 0.95–1.35 (Lippman et al., 2009 )) of developing pros - tate cancer was found in the SELECT trial at a dose of 400 IU/day (364 mg α - tocopherol/day) for ca.5.5 years.The three other trials found no effect of lower doses of α - tocopherol for similar or longer durations, i.e.
50 mg/day all rac - α- tocopherol ace - tate for 8 years in the ATBC (45 mg α - tocopherol/day), 400 IU on alternate days (182 mg α - tocopherol/day) for 8 years in the PHS II, and 400 IU/day (268 mg α- tocopherol/day) for ca. 4.5 years in the HOPE/HOPE- TOO trial.Given the heterogeneity of the studies, it is not known whether the effect observed in SELECT may be related to the form or dose of α - tocopherol used, the baseline characteristics of the participants or other unknown factors in this trial.No comprehensive UA is performed.3.4.3.2 | Observational studies Nine eligible prospective observational studies were retrieved.The evidence table is provided in Appendix B.3 .The studies were carried out in USA ( n = 6), Canada ( n = 1), Finland ( n = 1) and Denmark ( n = 1).FFQs were used to assess dietary ‘vitamin E’ intake in all studies; FFQs or questionnaires were used to assess supplemental ‘vitamin E’ intake.
When participants reported use of single supplements but information on the dose was missing, they were assigned 400 IU/day (Chan et al., 1999 ; Kirsh et al., 2006 ; Rodriguez et al., 2004 ; Wright et al., 2007 ). When participants reported use of multivitamins but information on the brand/dose was missing, they were assigned 30 IU/day (Agalliu et al., 2011 ; Kirsh et al., 2006 ; Wright et al., 2007 ).In all other studies, there is no indication on how missing information regarding the dose of supplemental α - tocopherol was handled (if applicable).Prostate cancer cases were identified either by self- reports and subsequently corroborated by medical and pathology reports, or by linkage to cancer registries.Total ‘vitamin E’ intake Five prospective observational studies (4 PC and one case- cohort study) reported on the association between total intake (i.e.
from diet and supplements) and prostate cancer risk (Agalliu et al., 2011 ; Chan et al., 1999 ; Peters et al., 2008 ; Roswall et al., 2013 ; Weinstein et al., 2007 ). Weinstein et al.( 2007 ) reported on total α - tocopherol intake, while the rest on total ‘vitamin E’ intake.Key study characteristics, together with the effect estimates and related CIs are plotted in Figure 10.Due to limited in - formation, the results of Chan et al.( 1999 ) are not included in the plot.FIGURE 10 Results from observational studies on total ‘vitamin E’ intake and prostate cancer risk.ATBC, α - Tocopherol, β- Carotene Cancer Prevention Study; CC, Case- cohort; CSDLH, Canadian Study of Diet, Lifestyle and Health; PC, Prospective cohort; VITAL, Vitamins and Lifestyle study.Notes : Studies estimated total ‘vitamin E’ intake i.e.from diet and supplements.
Peters et al., 2008 estimated the average daily intake over the previous 10 years of supplemental vitamin E intake by summing intake from individual supplements and intake from multivitamins in the 10- year period as: Years/10 × days per week/7 × dose. For Agalliu et al., 2011 and Peters et al., 2008 the follow- up time was estimated based on information provided in the publication.For Peters et al., 2008 number of participants per category is provided; in all other studies, the total number of participants is reported.| 39 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E There was no evidence of an increased risk of prostate cancer associated with higher total ‘vitamin E’ or total α - tocopherol intake in any of the studies.The Panel considers that the BoE from observational studies does not suggest a positive association between total ‘vita - min E’ or total α - tocopherol intake and risk of prostate cancer over the range of intakes examined in these studies.
Supplemental ‘vitamin E’ intake Seven prospective observational studies reported on the association between supplemental ‘vitamin E’ intake and prostate cancer risk (Chan et al., 1999 ; Kirsh et al., 2006 ; Peters et al., 2008 ; Rodriguez et al., 2004 ; Roswall et al., 2013 ; Stram et al., 2006 ; Wright et al., 2007 ). Depending on the study, the supplemental ‘vitamin E’ intake was based on the use of single supplements, multivitamins or both single supplements and multivitamins.Key study characteristics, together with the effect estimates and related Cis, are plotted in Figure 11.There was no indication for an increased risk of prostate cancer associated with higher supplemental ‘vitamin E’ intake in any of the studies.The Panel considers that the BoE from observational studies does not suggest a positive association between supple - mental ‘vitamin E’ intake and risk of prostate cancer over the range of intakes (up to ≥ 800 IU/day) reported in these studies.
3.4.3.3 | Animal data Because of the involvement of oxidative stress in carcinogenesis, a potential cancer prevention activity of α- tocopherol has been the subject of many studies in animal models. The text below focuses on experiments investigating prostate cancer.McCormick et al.( 2010 ) evaluated the effect of all rac - α- tocopherol acetate in a rat prostate cancer model in which ani - mals received an intravenous injection of N - methyl- N- nitrosourea (MNU) followed by chronic androgen stimulation.They were randomised to receive either basal diet only (control), or basal diet supplemented with α - tocopherol at 2000 or 4000 mg/kg diet (i.e.100 or 200 mg/kg bw per day) for 13 months.The number of adenocarcinoma in the dorsolateral plus an - terior prostate in the control, low- and high- dose group were 14/40 (35%), 15/40 (38%) and 22/40 (55%) ( p < 0.10 vs.dietary control).
In contrast, the number of adenocarcinoma in seminal vesicle in the respective groups were 8 (20%), 4 (10%) and 2 (5%) ( p < 0.05 vs. control).F I G U R E 11 Results from observational studies on supplemental ‘vitamin E’ intake and prostate cancer.CPS- II, Cancer Prevention Study II; HPFS, Health Professionals Follow- up Study; MEC, Hawaii- Los Angeles Multiethnic Cohort Study; NIH, National Institutes of Health; PC, Prospective cohort; PLCO, Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial; VITAL, Vitamins and Lifestyle study.Notes : Depending on the study, the supplemental ‘vitamin E’ intake was based on the use of single supplements, multivitamins or both single supplements and multivitamins.Peters et al.( 2008 ) estimated the average daily intake over the previous 10 years of supplemental vitamin E intake by summing intake from individual supplements and intake from multivitamins in the 10- year period as: years/10 × days per week/7 × dose.For Chan et al.
( 1999 ), Peters et al. ( 2008 ) and Rodriguez et al.( 2004 ), the follow- up time was estimated by the EFSA team based on information provided in the publication.For Wright et al.( 2007 ), Peters et al.( 2008 ) and Rodriguez et al.( 2004 )), number of participants per category is provided; in all other studies, the total number of participants is reported.For Stram et al.( 2006 ) and Roswall et al.( 2013 ), the total number of cases is reported.40 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E Ozten et al.( 2010 ) investigated whether α - tocopherol affected prostate carcinogenesis in a testosterone plus estradiol- treated NBL rat model.Rats were fed diets containing all rac - α- tocopherol acetate (2000 or 4000 mg/kg diet; i.e.100 or 200 mg/kg bw/day) or a control diet for 1 year.
α - tocopherol treatments did not affect prostate cancer incidence and multiplic - ity, while a reduction in the incidence of marked inflammation and marked epithelial dysplasia in the lateral prostate was found (dose- dependent). Total cancer incidence was similar across groups but an increased incidence of adenocarcinomas of the mammary glands of the groups treated with α - tocopherol compared to controls.In a prostate carcinogenesis mice model (hCYP1A mice treated with 2- amino- 1- methyl- 6- phenylimidazo [4,5- b] pyri - dine (PhIP)), a lower percentage of glands with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was found among mice receiving a diet supplemented with α - tocopherol (0.2% diet) for 40 weeks compared to those receiving the control diet (Chen et al., 2016 ).3.4.3.4 | Overall conclusions on prostate cancer The panel notes the increased risk of prostate cancer reported in the SELECT, at a dose of 400 mg all rac - α- tocopherol ace - tate.
However, this finding is not supported by three other RCTs, which used doses between 50 mg/day all rac - a- tocopheryl acetate and 400 IU/day RRR - α- tocopheryl acetate. Trials were heterogeneous regarding the form (natural vs.synthetic) or dose of α - tocopherol used, the baseline characteristics of the participants and other factors (i.e.ethnicity, smoking habits, health status, co- exposures to other agents).Observational prospective cohort studies do not provide supportive evidence for a positive relationship between α - tocopherol intake (including intake from food supplements) and risk of prostate can - cer.Animal data do not provide supportive evidence for an increased risk of prostate cancer in response to α - tocopherol.The panel considers that overall the available BoE is insufficient to conclude on a relationship between α- tocopherol intake and prostate cancer risk.
3.4.4 | Other adverse health effects 3.4.4.1 | All- cause mortality Several systematic reviews and meta- analyses of RCTs have investigated the effect of ‘vitamin E’ supplementation on all- cause mortality (Abner et al., 2011 ; Bjelakovic et al., 2013 ; Miller III et al., 2005 ; O'Connor et al., 2022 ).29 An increase of all- cause mortality was reported by Miller III et al. ( 2005 ) when pooling trials using ‘vitamin E’ supplemental doses ≥ 400 IU,30 either alone or in combination with other vitamins/minerals.In a subsequent systematic review, Abner et al.( 2011 ) found no evidence for an effect on mortality in subgroups analyses of trials using ‘vitamin E’ alone (1 1 trials) or vitamin E with other vitamins/minerals (46 trials).Including a larger number of studies using ‘vitamin E’ alone (20 trials), Bjelakovic et al.( 2013 ) found no evidence for an effect of ‘vitamin E’ on mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98–1.05, I2 = 0%).More recently, O'Connor et al.
( 2022 ) found no association between ‘vitamin E’ supplementation, alone (8 trials) or in combination with vitamin C (one trial) and all- cause mortality (OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.97–1.07]; 9 RCTs [ n = 107,772]). The panel notes that the nature of the outcome (composite of all causes of death) makes the interpretation of these data difficult.The panel considers that the available evidence on the relationship between α - tocopherol supplementation and all- cause mortality cannot be used for establishing a UL for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol).3.4.4.2 | Cataract risk A positive association between the use of ‘vitamin E’ as a single supplement (most common dose ~ 100 mg/day) and risk of developing age- related cataract has been reported in a prospective cohort study among Swedish Men (Zheng Selin et al., 2013 ).
In contrast, no evidence for an increased risk with supplemental intake of ‘vitamin E’ was found in other prospective cohorts (PHS (Seddon et al., 1994 ); NHS (Christen et al., 2008 ; Hankinson et al., 1992 ); Longitudinal Study of Cataract (Leske et al., 1998 ); Beaver Dam Eye Study (Lyle et al., 1999 )). The literature search identified six publications reporting data from five trials reporting on the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on the risk of developing cataracts.Cataracts risk was investigated as a secondary outcome in four stud - ies [(Teikari et al., 1997 ; Teikari et al., 1998 ) (ATBC); (Christen et al., 2008 ) (WHS); (Christen et al., 2008 ) (PHS II); (Christen et al., 2010 ) (SELECT Eye Endpoints)], and as the primary outcome of the VECAT trial (McNeil et al., 2004 ), which aimed at studying the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on the incidence or rate of progression of cataract.
The endpoints were cases of cataract (total or by subtype), identified through an ophthalmological examination of the study partici - pants and/or through Hospital Discharge Register (ATBC, VECAT) or self- reported and confirmed by medical records (PHS II, SELECT- SEE, WHS). The dose of α - tocopherol ranged between 45 mg/day (50 mg/day all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate) (ATBC) and 364 mg/day (400 IU/day all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate) (SELECT Eye Endpoints), and the duration of intervention was between 4 years (VECAT) and 9.7 years (WHS).The average age of participants at baseline ranged between 54 years (WHS) 29The literature search did not identify any additional study as compared to those included in these systematic reviews.30The authors converted the dosage of vitamin E in each trial to international units (IU) per day, with reference to Bieri and McKenna ( 1981 ), https:// doi.org/ 10.1093/ ajcn/ 34.2.289 .| 41 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E and 66 years (VECAT).
None of the studies indicated an increased risk of cataracts among the participants receiving the α - tocopherol supplementation compared to controls. The Panel notes that the available body of evidence does not suggest a positive relationship between α- tocopherol supplementation and the risk of age- related cataracts.The Panel considers that the available evidence on the relationship between α - tocopherol supplementation and risk of cataracts cannot be used for establishing a UL for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol).3.4.4.3 | Pregnancy- related outcomes Rumbold et al.( 2015 ) published a systematic review of RCTs to evaluate the safety of ‘vitamin E’ supplementation during pregnancy.A total of 21 trials were eligible for that review, of which only three trials administered supplemented ‘vitamin E’ alone versus placebo (Anthony et al., 1996 ; Sawhney et al., 2000 ; Shahraki, 2006 ).
Two of those were available as con - ference abstracts and did not report the dose and form of ‘vitamin E’ used (Anthony et al., 1996 ; Sawhney et al., 2000 ). Shahraki ( 2006 ) aimed to assess the effect of 100 mg/day ‘vitamin E’ supplementation (form not specified) for 45 days on leg cramps.The study did not report adverse effects of α - tocopherol under the conditions of the intervention.The present literature search identified two additional RCTs on α - tocopherol supplementation that were not included in the review by Rumbold et al.( 2015 ).Bastani et al.( 2011 ) randomised pregnant women to receive 296 mg/day α - tocopherol (400 IU/day RRR - α- tocopheryl acetate) or a placebo from week 14 of gestation to the end of pregnancy ( n = 104 in the inter - vention group) and assessed the risk of preeclampsia, birth weight and Apgar score.Wangkheimayum et al.
( 2011 ) reported the effect of 2- week supplementation of 400 IU/day as α - tocopheryl acetate (source not specified) versus a placebo in women with pre- eclampsia ( n = 24 in treatment group) on plasma concentrations of soluble P- selectin. These studies did not indicate adverse effects of α - tocopherol under the conditions of the interventions.The Panel notes that available RCTs do not indicate adverse effects of α - tocopherol under the conditions of the interven - tions.However, data are scarce and provide limited relevant information for the safety assessment.The Panel considers that the available evidence on the relationship between α - tocopherol intake and pregnancy- related outcomes cannot be used for establishing a UL for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol).
3.4.4.4 | Incidence and severity of respiratory infections The literature search identified 10 publications reporting data from three RCTs investigating the effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on the incidence of respiratory tract infections. Among these, four were selected for inclusion in this as - sessment (Graat et al., 2002 ; Hemilä et al., 2002 ; Hemilä et al., 2004 ; Meydani et al., 2004 ).The other papers are not described as they reported post hoc analyses of the same data (Hemilä, 2016a , 2016b ; Hemilä et al., 2003 ; Hemilä et al., 2006 ; Hemilä & Kaprio, 2011 ; van Amsterdam et al., 2005 ).Two trials were designed to assess the effect of α- tocopherol supplementation on incidence of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in older adults (≥ 60 years).
Based on a 2 × 2 factorial design, 652 community living older adults in the Netherlands were randomised to receive 400 mg/day α - tocopheryl acetate (source not specified), a multivitamin- mineral supplement, both or a placebo (Graat et al., 2002 ). Participants self- reported symptoms by telephone and a study nurse checked whether they met the definition of ARTI.When conducting microbiology and serology tests in a subsample of the symptomatic patients, infection was confirmed in 58% cases.During a median observation period of approximately 15 months, the incidence of ARTI was similar across groups.Comparisons of subjects receiving α - tocopherol versus no α - tocopherol indicated higher severity (illness duration, number of symptoms, fever episodes, restriction of activity) in those who had taken α - tocopherol.
In the other study, 617 older adults (≥ 65 years) residing in nursing homes in the USA were randomised to receive 182 mg/day α- tocopherol (200 IU/day all rac - α- tocopherol) or a placebo for 1 year (Meydani et al., 2004 ). Participants were ex - amined by trained nurses throughout the study and diagnosis of ARTI was made by study physicians.No increased risk or increased duration of ARTI was found with α - tocopherol supplementation.The two remaining papers reported on findings of the ATBC trial regarding the incidence of common colds, based on self- reporting at follow- up visits (not further verified) (Hemilä et al., 2002 ) and of hospital- treated pneumonia, ascertained through a national hospital discharge register (Hemilä et al., 2004 ).The follow- up period lasted 4 years for the first study and had a median duration of 5.8 years for the second study.
The results of the two studies did not indicate an effect of supplementation with 45 mg/day α- tocopherol (50 mg/day all rac - α- tocopherol acetate) on the risk of common colds or hospital- treated pneumonia incidence. The Panel notes that findings regarding an effect of α - tocopherol supplementation on respiratory tract infections are limited and inconsistent.The Panel considers that the available evidence on the relationship between α - tocopherol supplementation and respi - ratory tract infections cannot be used for establishing a UL for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol).42 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E 3.5 | Hazard characterisation 3.5.1 | Selection of the critical effect The Panel systematically reviewed the available evidence on the relationship between high dietary (i.e.including fortified foods and food supplements) intake of α - tocopherol and impaired blood coagulation and risk of bleeding, cardiovascular- related endpoints and prostate cancer.
It is well established that high doses of α - tocopherol increase the risk of bleeding in animals, and that the mechanisms by which α- tocopherol could impair blood clotting could be similar in animals and humans. An interaction with vitamin K ab - sorption and metabolism leading to prolonged PT and activated aPTT, and a decrease in platelet function, could be involved and explain why α - tocopherol may potentiate the effect of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications ( Section 3.4.1 ).The Panel notes that the available evidence from RCTs including a high percentage of participants on secondary pre - vention for CVD and/or treatment with antiplatelet medications suggests an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke upon α- tocopherol supplementation as compared to no α - tocopherol supplementation, placebo or no intervention.The Panel notes that available evidence from RCTs suggests an increased risk of CHF upon α - tocopherol supplementation following a myocardial infarction.
The Panel notes that individuals on secondary prevention for CVD and/or treatment with antiplatelet medications are under medical care and that any α - tocopherol supplementation should be under medical supervision. The Panel considers that these individuals are outside of the target population of a UL for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol).The Panel considers that, overall, the available BoE is insufficient to conclude on a relationship between α - tocopherol intake and prostate cancer risk.In line with the SCF conclusions, the Panel considers that the effect on blood clotting and the increased risk of bleeding is the critical effect to establish a UL for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol) for the general population.3.5.2 | Derivation of the UL No relevant new evidence was retrieved regarding the risk of bleeding events with α - tocopherol supplementation in human intervention studies.The SCF previously established a NOAEL based on highest dose tested in the study by Meydani et al.
(800 IU all rac - α- tocopherol), in which no effect was found on bleeding time. The Panel notes that two additional human intervention studies, which were not previously considered by the SCF, confirm this conclusion ( Section 3.4.1 ).These find - ings are supported by a lack of effect on PT and/or aPTT in human intervention studies which tested similar or lower α - tocopherol doses ( Section 3.4.1 ).The Panel notes that 800 IU all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate is equivalent to 728 mg ‘free' α - tocopherol ( Section 2.2.2 ).
In 2003, the SCF considered the dose of 800 IU all rac - α- tocopheryl acetate to correspond to 540 mg/day α - tocopherol equiva - lents.31 The Panel notes that additional evidence has become available regarding the mechanisms by which α - tocopherol may affect blood coagulation, including an interaction with vitamin K at the level of intestinal absorption and hepatic metab - olism, which is independent of the stereoisomeric forms of α - tocopherol ( Section 3.2.4.2 ). The Panel therefore considers that all stereoisomers can be expected to have a similar activity in relation to the risk of bleeding.Despite this progress in mecha - nistic understanding, the Panel found no basis to change the UL previously established by the SCF.Considering the totality of the available evidence and related uncertainties ( Section 3.4), the Panel thus retains the UL previously established by the SCF of 300 mg α - tocopherol/day for adults.The UL applies to all stereoisomeric forms of α - tocopherol.
The UL applies also to women during pregnancy and lactation, as no new evidence was found regarding specific ad - verse effects or different susceptibility in these groups. In the absence of specific data on younger age groups, the SCF derived UL for children and adolescents, aged 1–17 years, by extrapolating the adult UL using allometric scaling (body weight0.75).No new evidence was found investigating adverse effects of α - tocopherol supplementation in these age groups.The previously established ULs for α - tocopherol are also maintained by the NDA Panel for these population groups ( Table 11).There are no data to support a derivation of a UL for infants.On the other hand, there are no indications from the liter - ature that infants may be more susceptible than adults to α - tocopherol toxicity.The Panel notes that vitamin K deficiency during early infancy could lead to vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB).Vitamin K prophylaxis at birth is recommended (Mihatsch et al., 2016 ).
The following equations were applied (allometric scaling): 31The SCF converted all doses into α - tocopherol equivalents ( α- TE). The conversion was based on factors established to account for the different biological activity of natural (RRR- ) and synthetic (all rac- ) forms regarding α - tocopherol physiological requirements.ULinfant 4 −6 months =ULadult×/parenleft.s1body weightinfant 4 −6 months ∕body weightadult/parenright.s10.75=300×(7.2∕70 )0.75 ULinfant 7−11 months =ULadult×/parenleft.s1body weightinfant 7−11 months ∕body weightadult/parenright.s10.75=300×(8.6∕70 )0.75 | 43 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E Based on the reference body weight of the respective age groups and after rounding to the closest 10 mg,32 a UL of 50 mg/day is established for infants 4–6 months and of 60 mg/day for infants 7–1 1 months ( Table 10).
3.6 | Risk characterisation The ULs are established for the general European population and apply to vitamin E ( α- tocopherol) intakes from all dietary sources. The UL applies to all stereoisomeric forms of α - tocopherol ( Section 3.5.2 ).ULs do not apply to individuals receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications (e.g.aspirin) ( Section 2.1), to pa - tients on secondary prevention for CVD ( Section 3.4.2 ) or to patients with vitamin K malabsorption syndromes ( Section 2.1).ULs do not apply either to patients with specific conditions causing vitamin E deficiency ( Section 3.2.4.4 ).The Panel notes that these population groups are under medical care, and hence, any α - tocopherol supplementation should be under medical supervision.Harmonised data on α - tocopherol intake from all sources, including fortified foods and food supplements, for the European population are currently not available.
Data on the intake of α - tocopherol from fortified foods and food supple - ments available from national surveys are scarce ( Section 3.3.3 ). The Panel considers that it is unlikely that the ULs for vitamin E ( α- tocopherol) are exceeded in European populations, except for regular users of food supplements containing high doses of α - tocopherol ( Section 3.3).4 | CONCLUSIONS The ULs presented in Table 11 are established for the intake of vitamin E ( α- tocopherol) from all dietary sources.The UL applies to all stereoisomeric forms of α - tocopherol.ULs do not apply to individuals receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications (e.g.aspirin), to patients on secondary prevention for CVD or to patients with vitamin K malabsorption syn - dromes.ULs do not apply either to patients with specific conditions causing vitamin E deficiency.These population groups are under medical care, and hence, any vitamin E ( α- tocopherol) supplementation should be under medical supervision.

44 of 104 | TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E 5 | RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCH • Further research is required regarding all groups of the population to characterise potential critical effects of excess α- tocopherol intake. Also, investigations of the potential vulnerability of specific subgroups of the population, such as infants and children, pregnant women and older adults, is needed, taking into account specific issues in terms of absorp - tion, metabolism, distribution and excretion of α - tocopherol in these groups.• Further research is needed on the mechanisms of interaction between vitamin E and vitamin K, including in populations not receiving warfarin.• Further research is needed on the interaction of vitamin E with regular use of NSAIDs.• Data on the consumption of fortified foods and food supplements containing α - tocopherol in EU populations are scarce.
For the risk characterisation, there is a need to generate more and harmonised data on α- tocopherol intake in its differ - ent forms from food supplements and fortified foods.

Strokes were confirmed if they were characterised by a typical neurologic defect of sudden or rapid onset that lasted at least 24 h and was attributable to a cerebrovascular event.Strokes caused by infection or neoplasia were excluded.Reviews were conducted by physicians who had no knowledge of participants' risk factor status.
Strokes were subclassified, according to the criteria of the National Survey of Stroke, as due to ischaemia (embolism or thrombosis), subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracerebral haemorrhage or an unknown cause (29). If no records could be obtained, a stroke was considered probable if it necessitated hospitalisation and was corroborated by additional information provided in a letter or interview.Deaths were initially reported by next- of- kin, co- workers, postal authorities or the National Death Index.
Fatal strokes were confirmed by medical records (84%) or autopsy reports (2%) or were considered probable if medical records or autopsy reports could not be obtained and stroke was listed as the underlying cause of death on the death certificate (14%).Method: Repeated and validated dietary assessments were done by using a self- administered 131- i tem food- frequency questionnaire, which included questions on dose and duration of vitamin supplement use Info on vitamin K status/ intake: NR Quintiles of Supplemental Vitamin E ( α- t ocopherol) use: Q1: 0 IU/dayQ2: < 2 5 IU/day Q3: 25–99 IU/dayQ4: 100–249 IU/dayQ5: ≥ 2 50 IU/day Quintiles per person- years of Supplemental Vitamin E ( α- t ocopherol) use: Q1: 183598Q2: 54799Q3: 28414Q4: 12901Q5: 43321Quintiles for duration of Vitamin E supplement use (y): Q1: NoneQ2: 0–1Q3: 2–4Q4: 5–9Q5: ≥ 10Total cases for quintiles of Vitamin E use: Total stroke: 328Ischaemic stroke: 210Haemorrhagic stroke: 70 Unclassified: 48Total cases for quintiles of Vitamin E duration of use: Total stroke: 303Ischaemic stroke: 196Haemorrhagic stroke: 66 Cases/person years:328 strokes/323394 person- yearsMultivariate Relative Risk (95% CI): Multivariate Relative Risks for Stroke According to Use of Vitamin Supplements (Updated after 4 y ears of follow- u p): Covariates were calendar time (2- y ear intervals), total energy intake (continuous variable), smoking (current; past; and 1–14, 15–24 or $25 cigarettes/day), alcohol consumption (5, 5–9, 10–14, 15–29 or ≥ 3 0 g/day), history of hypertension, parental history of myocardial infarction before 65 y ears of age, profession and quintiles of body mass index and physical activity, in addition to age Multivariate Relative Risk for Stroke According to Duration of Supplement Use: Covariates were calendar time (2- y ear intervals), total energy intake (continuous variable), smoking (current; past; and 1–14, 15–24 or $25 cigarettes/day), alcohol consumption (5, 5–9, 10–14, 15–29 or $30 g/day), history of hypertension, parental history of myocardial infarction before 65 y ears of age, profession and quintiles of body mass index and physical activity, in addition to age.RR (95% CI)Total stroke (Supplement Vitamin E use):p value for trend: > 0 .2 Q1: ReferenceQ2: 1.00 (0.74–1.36)Q3: 1.01 (0.68–1.49)Q4: 1.00 (0.58–1.73)Q5: 1.13 (0.84–1.52)Ischaemic stroke (Supplement Vitamin E use):p value for trend: > 0 .2 Q1: ReferenceQ2: 0.88 (0.60–1.31)Q3: 0.89 (0.54–1.47)Q4: 0.89 (0.54–1.47)Q5: 1.16 (0.81–1.67)Haemorrhagic stroke (Supplement Vitamin E use):p value for trend: > 0 .2 Q1: ReferenceQ2: 0.74 (0.36–1.53)Q3: 0.93 (0.39–2.22)Q4: 2.00 (0.84–4.75)Q5: 1.03 (0.52–2.03)Total stroke (Duration of supplement Vitamin E use): p value for trend: > 0 .2 Q1: ReferenceQ2: 1.79 (0.92–3.51)Q3: 0.93 (0.54–1.59)Q4: 1.12 (0.71–1.75)Q5: 0.96 (0.63–1.46)Ischaemic stroke (Duration of supplement Vitamin E use): p value for trend: > 0 .2 Q1: ReferenceQ2: 1.88 (0.83–4.28)Q3: 0.84 (0.41–1.72)Q4: 1.09 (0.62–1.93)Q5: 1.06 (0.64–1.75)Haemorrhagic stroke (Duration of supplement Vitamin E use): p value for trend: 0.15Q1: ReferenceQ2: 1.75 (0.43–7.21)Q3: 1.52 (0.61–3.83)Q4: 1.51 (0.65–3.53Q5: 0.61 (0.19–1.95) | 83 of 104 TOLERABLE UPPER LEVEL FOR VITAMIN E Reference Study nameCountryStudy design Follow- up Fu ndingOriginal cohort(N total) Population sampled Exclusion criteriaStudy population ( n) Ascertainment of outcomeExposure groups Exposure assessment methodIncident cases n / person- y ears n/participants Test/Model covariates Results Pocobelli et al.
