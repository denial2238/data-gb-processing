The main sources of ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs are marine-based products, especially ﬁsh oils. Some food, supplements, and pharmaceutical products would include ﬁsh oils as a source of ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs; therefore, the quality assurance of these products is highly required.Some analytical methods mainly based on spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques have been reported.Molecular spectroscopy such as Infrared and Raman parallel to chemometrics has been successfully applied for quantitative analysis of individual and total ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs.This spectroscopic technique is typically applied as the alternative method to ofﬁcial methods applying chromatographic methods.Due to the capability to provide the separation of ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs from other components in the products, gas and liquid chromatography along with sophisticated detectors such as mass spectrometers are ideal analytical methods offering sensitive and speciﬁc results that are suitable for routine quality control.

Introduction Fish oils are good sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) including omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FAs) and omega-6 fatty acids ( ω-6 FAs).In terms of chemical structures, ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs can be differentiated from the ﬁrst double bond locations, counting from the terminal of methyl groups of the corresponding fatty acid.In ω-6 FAs, the ﬁrst double bond is located between the sixth and seventh carbon atoms, while for ω-3, the ﬁrst double bond is located between the third and fourth carbon atoms [ 1].Alpha-Linolenic acid or ALA (C18:3, ω-3), eicosapentaenoic acid or EPA (C20:5, ω-3), docosapentaenoic Molecules 2023 ,28, 5524.

The chemical structures of selected ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs are depicted in Figure 1.Molecules 2023 , 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 23 first double bond is located between the third and fourth carbon atoms [1].Alpha- Linolenic acid or ALA (C18:3, ω-3), eicosapentaenoic acid or EPA (C20:5, ω-3), docosapentaenoic acid or DPA (20:5 n -3), docosahexaenoic acid or DHA (C22:6, ω-3), tetracosapentaenoic acid or TPA (C24:5 n-3), and tetracosahexaenoic acid or THA (C24:6n - 3) are among ω-3 FAs, while linoleic acid or LA (C18:2, ω-6) and arachidonic acid or ARA (C20:4, ω-6) are example of ω-6 FAs.
The chemical structures of selected ω-3 FAs and ω-6 FAs are depicted in Figure 1. In marine oils, the most dominant ω-FAs are DHA, ARA, and EPA.Linolenic an d linoleic acids are essential FAs needed by the human body and contain double bonds that are not synthesized in the human body [2].ω-3 FAs are believed to contribute positive potentials to human health.The beneficial health effects of ω-3 FAs, especially EPA and DHA, were firstly described in the Greenland Eskimos , who consumed a high seafood diet and exhibited low rates of coronary heart disease, type I diabetes mellitus, asthma, and mult iple sclerosis.Since this observation, the advantageous effects of ω-3 FAs have been widely explored.The consumption of foods containing EPA and DHA is associated with low risk of cardiovascular attack [3].EPA and DHA are essential for proper fetal development and brain development and for lowering depression risk [4].
It is believed that a diet rich in ω-6 FAs could promote the pathogenesis of some chronic inflammatory diseases. These beneficial effects have attracted scientist s to explore the natural s ources of ω-3 and ω-6 FAs.A well-balanced ω-3/ω-6 FAs ratio is reported to be proven for promoting health and preventing disease formation, mostly in the Mediterranean diet.In addition, the balance of ω-3 and ω-6 FAs is an important determinant in decrea sing the risks of coronary heart disease (CHD), cancer, diabetes, arthritis, hypertension, and other neurodegenerative diseases.As a consequence, some research has reported this ratio value.The ratio of ω-6/ω-3 from 3:1 to 4:1 could prevent pathogenesis of various diseases [5].Figure 1.The chemical structures of omega -3 fatty acids including alpha-Linolenic acid (C18:3, ω-3), eicosapentaenoic acid or EPA (C20:5, ω-3), and docosahexaenoic acid or DHA (C22:6, ω-3), as well as Figure 1.

The consumption of foods containing EPA and DHA is associated with low risk of cardiovascular attack [ 3]. EPA and DHA are essential for proper fetal development and brain development and for lowering depression risk [ 4].It is believed that a diet rich in ω-6 FAs could promote the pathogenesis of some chronic inﬂammatory diseases.These beneﬁcial effects have attracted scientists to explore the natural sources ofω-3 andω-6 FAs.A well-balanced ω-3/ω-6 FAs ratio is reported to be proven for promoting health and preventing disease formation, mostly in the Mediterranean diet.In addition, the balance of ω-3 andω-6 FAs is an important determinant in decreasing the risks of coronary heart disease (CHD), cancer, diabetes, arthritis, hypertension, and other neurodegenerative diseases.As a consequence, some research has reported this ratio value.The ratio ofω-6/ω-3 from 3:1 to 4:1 could prevent pathogenesis of various diseases [5].
Molecules 2023 ,28, 5524 3 of 20 EPA and DHA cannot be synthesized in the human body de novo; therefore, human and mammals should obtain them from the diet. However, both EPA/DHA and other n-3 long-chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids can be synthesized from their precursor of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3 n-3) through the desaturation and elongation of EPA.Unfortunately, the conversion rate of ALA into EPA/DHA is very low because of the limited activity of the ∆6-desaturase enzyme [ 6] (Figure 2).Some ﬁsh species have elongase and desaturase enzymes, which enable them to convert linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6) into ARA and ALA into EPA and DHA [ 7].Thus, EPA/DHA must be provided favorably from the diet, especially from the main source of marine-based foods [ 8].
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the recommended daily intake of EPA + DHA is set between 100 and 250 mg for children up to 10 years, 250 mg for healthy adults, and 300 mg for pregnant women (of which at least 200 mg must be DHA). On the other hand, arachidonic acid, an n-6 polyunsaturated 20-carbon fatty acid formed by the biosynthesis of linoleic acid, was reported to play important roles in infant development [ 9].For this reason, the evaluation of ω-FAs is very important to conﬁrm their contents in food and supplement products [10].Molecules 2023 , 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 23 omega-6 fatty acids inclu ding linoleic acid or LA (C18:2, ω-6) and arachidonic acid or ARA (C20:4, ω- 6).EPA and DHA cannot be synthesized in the human body de novo; therefore, human and mammals should obtain them from the diet.
However, both EPA/DHA and other n -3 long-chain poly -unsaturated fatty acids can be synthesized from their precursor of alpha - linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3 n-3) through the desaturation and elongation of EPA . Unfortunately, the conversion rate of ALA into EPA/DHA is very low because of the limited activity of the ∆6-desaturase enzyme [6] (Figure 2).Some fish species have elongase and desaturase enzymes , which enable them to convert linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n - 6) into ARA and ALA into EPA and DHA [7].Thus, EPA/DHA must be provided favorably from the diet, especially from the main source of marine -based foods [8].According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the recommended daily intake of EPA + DHA is set between 100 and 250 mg for children up to 10 years, 250 mg for healthy adults, and 300 mg for pregnant women (of which at least 200 mg must be DHA).
On the other hand, arachidonic acid, an n -6 polyunsaturated 20 -carbon fatty acid formed by the biosynthesis of linoleic acid, was reported to play important roles in infant development [9]. For this reason, the evaluation of ω-FAs is very important to confirm their contents in food and supplement products [10].Figure 2.The conversion pathway of omega -3 fatty acids represented by osbond acid and omega -6 fatty acids represented by docosahexaenoic acid [11].2.Chemometrics Chemometrics can be described as the science implementing statistical and mathematical techniq ues to obtain relevant information related to process, design, and optimal selection by analy zing chemical data [12,13].In the last two decades, chemometrics has been widely applied in the field of chemistry to enhance analytical methods such as spectrosc opy and chromatographic -based methods [14,15].

Unsupervised pattern recogni- tion of PCA and supervised pattern recognition of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogies (SIMCA) have been generated to investigate the potential substitution of valuable ﬁsh species with cheaper materials [ 18].

A multivariate calibration technique of partial least squares regression (PLSR) has been successfully developed to build prediction models for determ ining fatty acids content (%) from eight fish oil samples [19]. Figure 3 presents the scheme of chemometrics application for analy zing omega -3 or omega-6 fatty acids using spectroscopic and chromatographic -based methods.Figure 3.The detailed workflow o f analytical methods and chemometrics techniques used for analysis of omega -3 (ω-3) or omega -6 (ω-6) fatty acids using spectroscopic and chromatographic - based methods [20].A set of initial data , which are collected from analytical instruments such as spectrophotometer and/or chromatography , could be used for chemometrics analysis.At first, several data pre -processing and outlier detection s can be applied to support the subsequent analytical modeling [21].
In the case of supervised pattern recognition modeling, a matrix of data achieved from the pre -processing stage has been divided into two groups consisting of the training set (70% of the data) and test set (30% of the data). This partition will enable t he implementation of internal model validation, cross validation, and external validation of the model [22].The generation of the model followed by the model optimization by components selection are then executed.Performance quality for model accuracy ca n be evaluated by assessing the determination coefficient of the calibration model (R cal2) and the determination coefficient of cross - validation (R CV2), whereas the difference or error between the actual and predicted value s of the model can be evaluated b y root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and root mean square error of cross -validation (RMSECV) [23].It can be noted that the data refinement can be applied to improve the model quality.
The final chemometrics model is generated by considering the external validation using test set data. The quality of the prediction should be evaluated using the determination coefficient of validation (R val2) and Figure 3.The detailed workﬂow of analytical methods and chemometrics techniques used for analysis of omega-3 ( ω-3) or omega-6 ( ω-6) fatty acids using spectroscopic and chromatographic- based methods [20].A set of initial data, which are collected from analytical instruments such as spec- trophotometer and/or chromatography, could be used for chemometrics analysis.At ﬁrst, several data pre-processing and outlier detections can be applied to support the subsequent analytical modeling [ 21].In the case of supervised pattern recognition modeling, a matrix of data achieved from the pre-processing stage has been divided into two groups consisting of the training set (70% of the data) and test set (30% of the data).

Further, the ﬁnal chemometrics techniques with appropriate features can be applied for sample evaluation. 3.Ofﬁcial Methods of Analysis of ω-3 FAs and Related Compounds In the current USP-NF online, three ω-3 FA compounds have been described, i.e., ω-3 free fatty acids [ 24],ω-3 acid triglycerides [ 25], andω-3-acid ethyl esters [ 26].Ω-3 free fatty Molecules 2023 ,28, 5524 5 of 20 acids are a mixture of ω-3 acids in their free form.
They consist mainly of alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3), moroctic acid (C18:4 n-3), eicosatetraenoic acid (C20:4 n-3), eicosapen- taenoic acid (EPA) (C20:5 n-3), heneicosapentaenoic acid (C21:5 n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6 n-3) [ 24].Ω-3 acid triglycerides are a mixture of mono, di, and tri-esters of ω-3 acids with glycerol containing mainly tri-esters and obtained either by esteriﬁcation of concentrated and puriﬁed ω-3 acids with glycerol or by transesteriﬁcation of the ω-3 acid ethyl esters with glycerol [25]. Omega-3-acid ethyl esters are a mixture of ethyl esters, principally the ethyl esters of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPAee) (C20:5 n-3, EE) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHAee) (C22:6 n-3, EE).They may also include ethyl esters of alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3, EE), moroctic acid (C18:4 n-3, EE), eicosatetraenoic acid (C20:4 n-3, EE), heneicosapentaenoic acid (C21:5 n-3, EE), and docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 n-3, EE).
Tocopherol may be added as an antioxidant [26]. The content of EPA, DHA, and total ω-3 free fatty acids are determined using GC equipped with FID (270◦), column: 0.25-mm ×25-m; coated with a 0.20- µm ﬁlm of phase G16 (Carbowax 20M), injection port: 250◦, split ratio: 200/1 temperature programmed: initial: 170◦(2 min) then raise to 240◦(3◦/min, 2.5 min).For verifying the methods, two SSTs (standard solution tests) are used; SST 1 consists of USP ω-3 free fatty acid RS, while SST 2 consists of DHA methyl ester and tetracos-15-enoic acid methyl ester.USP EPA RS and USP DHA RS are used as the standard, and USP methyl tricosanoate RS is used as IS.Detailed preparations of SST solutions and samples can be referred to in this ofﬁcial method [24].
Acceptance criteria: RRt (relative retention time) of alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3;0.564), moroctic acid (C18:4 n-3; 0.592), eicosatetraenoic acid (C20:4 n-3; 0.776), EPA (C20:5 n-3; 0.793), heneicosapentaenoic acid (C21:5 n-3; 0.887), and docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 n-3; 0.973) are calculated against Rt (retention time) of DHA (C22:6 n-3; 1.00). Chromatogram of sample should be similar to SST 1.EPA should be NLT 45% and NMT 65%, DHA NLT 10% NMT 30%, and total ω-3 free fatty acids NLT 80%.[24] Unfortunately, this current USP-NF online (https://online.uspnf.com/uspnf, accessed on 28 May 2023) does not describe the method for determination of similarity of the chromatograms.Alaerts et al.described the application of the correlation coefﬁcient rand the congruence coefﬁcient cfor the determination of the similarity [27].
The following ofﬁcial procedure of the general chapter <401> of USP 46-NF 41 may be used for the determination of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C20:5 n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6 n-3), and total ω-3 FAs obtained from ﬁsh, plant, or microbial sources in bulk oils and encapsulated oil, either as triglycerides or as ethyl esters. The term “triglyceride” is applicable to algal oils, ﬁsh oils, ﬁsh liver oils, and products containing ω-3 FAs in triglyceride form [ 28].If using split injection, the GC-FID method is identical to [ 16], if using splitless injection, the conditions have modiﬁed as follows: injection port: 90–250◦, column temperature programmed: 90◦(2 min) raise to 170◦(30/min, 3.0 min), then raise to 240◦(3◦/min, 2 min).Concentrations of EPA, DHA, and total ω-3 FAs (for triglycerides or ethyl ester) are estimated.Detailed methods including sample preparations, SSTs, and acceptance criteria have been described in this general chapter [28].
The ofﬁcial GC method of the general chapter <401> of USP 46-NF 41 [ 28] has been applied for the determination of EPA, DHA, and total ω-3 FAs in the monograph of ω-3 acid triglycerides [ 25],ω-3 acid ethyl esters [ 23,26], ﬁsh oil containing ω-3 FAs [ 29], and other related monographs including materials from plants. In the current USP-NF online https://online.uspnf.com/uspnf (accessed on 29 May 2023), 15 monographs describe the methods of analysis of ω-3 FAs and related compounds.SSTs and acceptance criteria can be referred to in the respective monographs.Veriﬁcation or validation methods should be performed prior to routine application of the ofﬁcial methods in the QC laboratory of the pharmaceutical industry.If the results of the SSTs can fulﬁl the criteria that are described in the respected monographs, there is no need to perform full validation methods [30,31].Molecules 2023 ,28, 5524 6 of 20 4.
Chromatographic-Based Methods for Analysis of ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs Due to their capacity as separation techniques, chromatographic-based methods of- fered excellent analytical methods for analysis of ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs in marine products. Currently, the types of chromatograph instruments along with their components, mainly columns and detectors, are available in the laboratories, therefore, the routine analysis of fatty acids can be carried out efﬁciently and effectively [ 32].Chromatographic methods can be used for separation, identiﬁcation, and quantiﬁcation of these fatty acids with reliable results.Gas chromatography using detectors such as a ﬂame ionization detector (GC-FID) and mass detector (GC-MS) are the most common chromatographic techniques used for determination of ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs.Liquid chromatography tandem with mass spec- trometry (LC-MS or LC-MS/MS) is also an effective analytical technique for the analysis of omega fatty acids without the derivatization step [33].
4.1. Gas Chromatography for Analysis of ω-3 FAs and ω-6 FAs Among analytical methods used for fatty acids analysis, chromatographic-based techniques, mainly gas chromatography, have been extensively reported for analysis of fatty acids including ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs.In addition, GC also provides a sensitive, accurate, precise, rapid, and reproducible analysis with efﬁcient separation due to the low mass transfer compared to liquid chromatography.Gas chromatography (GC) is a chromatographic separation technique based on the difference in the distribution of organic compounds between two non-miscible phases in which the mobile phase is a carrier gas moving through or passing the stationary phase contained in a column.GC is appropriate for analyzing any organic compounds or their derivatives, which are volatilized under the temperatures employed.Mainly, GC is based on the mechanisms of adsorption or mass distribution [ 34].
The common carrier gas is helium, nitrogen, or hydrogen, and it depends on the column and detector in use. The ﬂow of carrier gas through the column and the detector is performed at a controlled rate or pressure [ 34,35].A brief discussion regarding general GC system instrumentation has been previously published [ 36], while discussion on gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) systems can be referred to in previous published papers [37,38].Injection may be performed either into a vaporization chamber, which may be equipped with a stream splitter, or directly at the head of the column using a syringe or an injection valve [ 34].Today, the most used injectors for capillary GC fall into one of four tech- niques, i.e., split, splitless, on-column injection, and programmed-temperature vaporizers (PTV) [ 39].
The liquid stationary phases used in GC are contained in a column that com- prises either a capillary column (at least 5 m, 0.1–0.53 mm i.d.) whose stationary phase may be a solid coating on the inner surface (0.1–5.0 µm ﬁlm) of the column (e.g., macrogol 20,000) or a liquid deposited on the inner surface (e.g., dimethylpolysiloxane); in the latter case, it may be chemically bonded to the inner surface and a column packed (1–3 m, 2–4 mm i.d.) with the stationary phase that may be a solid phase (e.g., alumina, silica) or an inert solid support (usually a porous polymer impregnated or coated with a liquid) [34,35]. Two distinct types of detectors are used in GC, namely mass-dependent or concentration- dependent.A mass-dependent detector responds to mass per unit time entering the de- tector, not mass per unit volume.
Mass-dependent detectors are destructive, and the compounds eluting from the column are chemically modiﬁed or destroyed in the detector (e.g., FID, ﬂame photometric detector (FPD), nitrogen chemiluminescence detector (NCD), mass spectrometer (MS)). Concentration-dependent detectors are non-destructive and can therefore be used in series with other detectors (e.g., thermal conductivity detector (TCD), electron capture detector (ECD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR)) [ 40].Detectors for GC can be also classiﬁed based on their selectivity.TCD is a universal detector that can respond to all compounds except the carrier gas.Most common GC detectors fall into the selective designation, e.g., FID for all organic compounds that contain C–C and C–H bonds, ECD for organic compounds that contain halogen and phosphorous groups, FPD for S and P compounds, NCD for N compounds, and NPD for pesticides.
In addition, MS and FT-IR Molecules 2023 ,28, 5524 7 of 20 detectors can be used for identifying organic compounds in samples by comparing their spectra to authentic standards and/or libraries [41]. GC can be applied for qualitative and quantitative analysis.Quantitative analysis can be performed using direct calibration (using external and internal standard methods) and standard addition methods [ 34,41].Fingerprint analysis can be performed for the identiﬁcation and characterization of plant/herbal materials and related products [ 42].Identiﬁcation of organic compounds in herbal or plant materials can be performed using combination GC-MS or GC-HR-MS-MS and many free online MS databases.To have reliable results of analysis, all methods (qualitative and quantitative) should be properly validated prior to routine application.Detailed validation methods for chromatography analysis have been reviewed and discussed by previous publications [43,44].
The advancements in GC instrumentation coupled with data processing have led to the evolution of this method as a reference method for analysis of fatty acids in marine organisms. However, in some cases, the extensive sample preparation including extraction and derivatization steps must be done before being subjected to GC analysis [ 45].Fatty acids are non-volatile enough; therefore, the derivatization of fatty acids is required.In GC, the derivatization step is required when the analytes are non-volatile, thermally labile, and low sensitivity.Methylation of FAs is the most common method for derivatization of FAs to provide volatile fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs).Many methylation techniques are reported in the scientiﬁc literature, and among them, acid-catalyzed methylation, alkaline-catalyzed methylation, methylation using boron triﬂuoride (BF3), methylation with diazomethane, and silylation are the most used [ 46].
Extraction of fatty acids and other lipid components was typically carried using different methods (direct extraction, mac- eration, Soxhlet extraction, Folch, Bligh–Dyer) employing organic solvents with different polarities [47]. GC-FID has been developed and validated for quantitative analysis of ω-3 FAs of DHA and EPA in raw and cooked ﬁsh [ 48].Fatty acids were derivatized as fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), and the derivatized fatty acids were subjected to GC-FID analysis.The column used is a capillary column of a GC HP-88 column (60 m length, 0.25 mm ID, 0.2µm DF) with a polar stationary phase.The validation of GC-FID followed the guidance from the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) by determining and evaluating some characteristics of performance including linearity with r-value > 0.9995, precision with RSD ≤2%, accuracy with recovery percentage of >95%, speciﬁcity with good peaks separation, and sensitivity with low detection limits.
All validation parameters meet acceptance criteria set by ICH requirements. The developed analysis was successfully employed for determination of EPA and DHA in ﬁsh samples.GC-FID is also successful for determination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids including EPA and DHA by applying two different cyanopropyl silicone capillary columns (DB-225ms and DB-23).The method is valid based on ICH requirements [46].GC-MS, the combination of two powerful instruments, namely GC for separation and MS for detection, has become a popular method for the conﬁrmation and quantitative analysis ofω-3 FAs (EPA/DHA) in supplement capsules containing ﬁsh oils.Quantiﬁcation of EPA/DHA was carried out using selective ion mode (SIM) using m/z79 as the ion fragment EPA/DHA.Fatty acids were released from triglycerides using KOH (potassium hydroxide)-methanolic solution (followed by esteriﬁcation with BF3-methanol solution to provide FAMEs).
The method was validated according to the ICH (International Council for Harmonization), and all validation parameters ﬁt with acceptance criteria set by ICH requirements. Limit of detection (LoD) values obtained were 0.08 ng and 0.21 ng for EPA and DHA, respectively, with RSD values of intra-day and inter-day variations of <0.59% and 1.00% for EPA and <1.08% and 1.05% for DHA.The percentages of average recoveries for EPA and DHA were 100.50% and 103.83%, respectively.The validated method was successfully used for analysis of EPA and DHA contents in commercial capsules containing ﬁsh oils.There is no correlation between the contents of EPA/DHA and the price of supplement capsules [ 49].GC-MS was also applied for analysis of ω-3 (ALA, EPA, DHA, Molecules 2023 ,28, 5524 8 of 20 DPA) andω-6 FAs (dihomo-linoleic acid or DGLA and ARA) with valid results [ 50].

For this reason, a greener method of analysis based on HPLC, which does not involve the complex step, should be used. Direct HPLC-UV detection is limited for determination of ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs since FAs lack chromophore groups requiring low wavelengths, which limits the solvent selection and increases the likelihood of matrix interference.The combination of the dual-gradient HPLC method and charged aerosol detection has enabled the determination of ω-3 FAs andω-3 FAs in a single analysis without derivatization of analytes as in GC-FID/GC-MS.• Liquid chromatography (LC) is a chromatographic separation technique based on the difference in the distribution of species between two non-miscible phases in which the mobile phase is a liquid that eluted through a stationary phase contained in a column.The term LC is synonymous with high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) [ 35,59].
Particle diameter of the stationary phase for classical HPLC is about 2–10 µm; if the particle diameter is less than 2 µm, the term becomes ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) [ 60]. A liquid chromatograph comprises (1) a pumping Molecules 2023 ,28, 5524 10 of 20 system, (2) an injector, (3) a chromatographic column (a column temperature controller may be used), and (4) one or more detectors and data acquisition systems [59].Depending on the type of interaction of the sample molecules with both mobile and stationary phases, different types of interactions can be possible in LC: adsorption chromatography, partition chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, afﬁnity chro- matography, and size exclusion chromatography [ 60].
Stationary phases used for LC are silica or alumina, a variety of chemically modiﬁed supports prepared from polymers, silica or porous graphite, resins or polymers with acidic or basic groups, porous silica or poly- mers, and specially modiﬁed stationary phases for the separation of enantiomers (chiral chromatography) [59]. Mobile phases are a solvent or a mixture of solvents, as deﬁned in the individual monograph of the Pharmacopeias.For normal-phase LC, low-polarity organic solvents are generally employed.In reversed-phase LC, aqueous mobile phases, usually with organic solvents and/or modiﬁers, are employed.Mobile phases may contain other components, for example, a counter-ion for ion-pair chromatography or a chiral selector for chiral chromatography using an achiral stationary phase.The technique of continuously changing the mobile phase’s composition during the chromatographic run is called gradient elution or solvent programming.
Mobile phases should be ﬁltered to remove particles greater than 0.45µm in size (or greater than 0.2 µm when the stationary phase is made of sub-2.0 µm particles and when special detectors, e.g., light-scattering detectors, are used) [35,59]. Many detectors can be used for LC; these include UV-Vis, DAD, ﬂuorescence spec- trophotometers, RI, ED, CAD, MS or MS/MS, and MALS [ 59].In chemical or pharma- ceutical analysis, LC can be applied for identiﬁcation and purity tests and quantitative analysis (assay) using absolute curve calibration methods and internal standardization methods [ 61].Qualitative identiﬁcation and purity tests of plant/herbal materials and related products using ﬁngerprints have been previously reviewed and discussed [ 42].De- tailed theory, method development, optimizations, and troubleshooting using LC methods have been described and discussed [ 60].
Identiﬁcation of organic compounds or metabo- lites in plant/herb materials can be performed using combination LC-HR-MS/MS and many online MS databases. Reliable data can be only obtained if all methods used are validated prior to applications; for detailed discussion regarding this matter, refer to the previous publications by Riswanto et al.and Irnawati et al.[ 14,16].If the recovery of the method using LC-MS/MS is not acceptable, the matrix effect should be evaluated [ 62].Table 2 compiles the application of HPLC and LC-MS for analysis of ω-3 andω-6 FAs in marine products.Table 2.The application of HPLC and LC-MS for analysis of ω-3 andω-6 FAs in marine products.ω-3 andω-6 FAs (Samples) Sample Preparation HPLC/LC-MS or LC-MS/MS Condition Results Ref.EPA and DHA from ﬁsh oils (rainbow trout oil)The fatty acids were extracted, then the EPA and DHA were further puriﬁed using HPLC.HPLC method using mobile phase of ethanol HPLC grade and ultra-pure water.

Elution was performed in isocratic mode using acetonitrile:ammonium formate buffer (10 mM) containing 0.05% formic acid as the mobile phase.The EPA and DHA were analyzed in a positive ionization mode using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.The multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) transition used for quantiﬁcation was 331.30 →285.00 for ethyl eicosapentaneoate, 336.30 →285.00 for ethyl eicosapentaneoate D5, 357.30 →131.00 for ethyl docosahexenoate, and 362.00 →131.00 for ethyl docosahexenoate D5.It showed that the LC-MS/MS method could be used to measure EPA and DHA in a simple way.In addition, it can be applied in samples with high interferences [32].5.
Molecular Spectroscopic Methods for Analysis of ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs Molecular spectroscopy is the collection of analytical methods based on the interaction between electromagnetic radiations in a certain energy with samples in the molecular levels. UV-Visible, Raman, Infrared (near, mid, and far), and nuclear magnetic resonance are among the molecular spectroscopic techniques widely used for analysis of fatty acid compositions.The different concentrations and functional groups present in ω-3 FAs and ω-6 FAs are main factors contributing to the different spectra proﬁles [ 76].Combined with chemometrics techniques, molecular spectroscopic techniques, mainly Raman and FTIR, have been widely applied for the prediction of ω-3 FA andω-6 FA levels in marine products [77,78].FTIR spectroscopy in combination with chemometrics of multivariate calibrations has been developed and validated for analysis of total ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs in adipose tissue of rainbow trout ( Onchorhynchus mykiss ) ﬁsh.
The individual ω-3 FAs (APA, EPA, and DHA) and individual ω-6 FAs (ALA and ARA) were determined using GC-FID. The multivariate calibrations of PLS and ridge regression methods were used for constructing the quantitative model of predicting ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs applying the absorbance values at combined wavenumber regions of Raman spectra at 550–1800 and 2610–3100 cm−1.Raman spectra were previously subjected to pre-processing using standard normal variate (SNV) transformation to eliminate Raman spectral variations.The processed Raman spectra were used for PLS and ridge regression methods (RRM).PLS and RRM are designed to estimate linear prediction scores when the number of predicting variables (Raman spectra at selected wavenumbers) exceeds the training sample size.RRM introduces a shrinkage parameter intended to ﬁnd the best compromise between prediction and variance.The cross-validation was employed to compare the prediction models as represented by RMSEP and RMSECV values.
In cross-validation models, the actual values of total ω-3 FAs and ω-6 FAs as determined by GC-FID and FTIR predicted values provided an R2of 0.66 and 0.86, respectively. For individual ω-3 FAs, ALA, EPA, and DHA were found to have good R2values (0.82, 0.76, and 0.81, respectively).This indicated that the combination of Raman and PLS-RRM is suitable for analysis of individual ω-3 FAs and total ω-6 FAs but is not accurate for prediction total ω-3 FAs [79].Molecules 2023 ,28, 5524 14 of 20 Previous studies also reported the employment of FTIR spectroscopy combined with PLS for prediction of the levels of EPA, DHA, and total ω-3 FAs in micro-encapsulated ﬁsh oil supplements.The supplement powders were directly subjected to the attenuated total reﬂectance (ATR) accessory, and their FTIR spectra were recorded at 4000–500 cm−1 in absorbance mode.
The chemometrics of exploratory data analysis of PCA was used to identify the principal components (PC), which are linear combinations of original variables (absorbance values at certain wavenumbers capable of identifying the wavenumbers di- rectly proportional to levels of EPA, DHA, and total ω-3 FAs). The PCA matrix plot of the spectral results reveals an increased intensity of peaks at wavenumbers of 2923, 1744, and 1146 cm−1, therefore, the combined wavenumbers region of 3100–2800 and 1800–950 cm−1, which represented the best model for every target fatty acid, was optimized and used for quantitative modeling.
Using multivariate calibration of PLS, a good correlation existed between actual values of EPA, DHA, and total ω-3 FAs as determined using GC-FID (x-axis, in mg/g) and FTIR predicted values (y-axis, in mg/g) with the equations of: y = 1.0058x + 0.3070 with R2of 0.9878, RMSE of 1.5931 (EPA), y = 1.0058x + 0.3070 with R2of 0.9875, RMSE of 1.0926 (DHA), and y = 1.0058x + 0.3070 with R2of 0.9875, RMSE of 1.0926 (total ω-3 FAs). The high R2and low values of RMSE indicated that FTIR spectroscopy at selected wavenumbers regions offer accurate and precise analytical methods for the prediction of EPA, DHA, and total ω-3 FAs.This developed method could be an alternative technique to GC-FID [77].Raman spectroscopy in combination with chemometrics of standard normal variate (SNV) and multivariate calibration of PLS has been successfully used for the prediction of EPA, DHA, and total ω-3 FAs.
Some regions of Raman spectra were subjected to optimization to provide the best relationship models between actual values of EPA, DHA, and totalω-3 FAs as determined using GC-FID and FTIR predicted values. The regions capable of providing the highest R2values and the lowest values of RMSEC and RMSEP were selected for PLSR modeling.Whole Raman spectra regions, the combined regions of 3150–2460 and 1800–769 cm−1, and regions of 1800–769 cm−1provide comparable results during the calibration modeling in terms of R2values, RMSECV , and number of PLS factors.This result conﬁrmed that the combination of Raman spectra and PLSR could be used for the quantitative analysis of ω-3 FAs with acceptable accuracy and precision performances [ 80].Raman spectra combined with chemometrics of PLSR and PCA could be used for quantitative analysis of EPA, DHA, and total ω-3 FAs and classiﬁcation of ﬁsh oils andω-3 PUFA concentrates in intact soft gel (gelatin) capsules [ 81].
The handled Raman spectroscopy combined with multivariate calibrations of PLSR using the algorithm of NIPALS has been employed for analysis of EPA, DHA, and EPA + DHA in the commercial supplement samples of encapsulated omega-3 oils. The absorbance values of Raman spectra at regions of 1800 to 800 cm−1were used for this task [82].The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry method could be successfully utilized for analysis of ω-3 FAs in ﬁsh oil by accurate quantiﬁcation of EPA and DHA.Dimethyl terephthalate was used as an internal standard.The NMR peak at 2.391 ppm was selected for DHA quantiﬁcation, whereas the peak at 1.697 was chosen for EPA quan- tiﬁcation.The method was validated, demonstrating good results in terms of speciﬁcity, precision, and stability [ 83].From the above results, it can be concluded that FTIR and Raman spectroscopy combined with suitable chemometrics techniques could be an alterna- tive method for the ofﬁcial method based on GC-MS.
Molecular spectroscopy offers a rapid and sensitive enough method with comparable results to GC-MS for determination of ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs in marine products with the main advantage of simplicity in instrument operation and with minimum sample preparation [84].

Gas chromatography coupled with ﬂame ionization detection (GC-FID) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) are the methods of choice (ofﬁcial methods) for anal- ysis ofω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs in marine-based products, especially ﬁsh oils. In addition, molecular spectroscopy such as Infrared and Raman in combination with chemometrics has been successfully applied for quantitative analysis of individual and total ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs and is considered as an alternative technique to GC-FID and GC-MS.Gas chromatography and liquid chromatography-based methods provide advantages in terms of sensitivity for analysis of ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs in marine natural products.However, a simpliﬁcation of sample preparation could be acquired using molecular spectroscopy tech- niques.
Therefore, in the future, molecular spectroscopic techniques should be subjected to collaborative study among competent laboratories to prove that molecular spectroscopy is one of the standard methods for analysis of ω-3 FAs andω-6 FAs in marine natural products as well as in food and pharmaceutical products.
