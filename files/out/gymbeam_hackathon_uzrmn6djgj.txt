A significant reduction (P < 0.05) in IL-6 level was observed in the C + Lf group and C + HSE + Lf group compared with C group and C + HSE group. The intake of HSE decreased (P < 0.05) plasma MCP-1 concentrations.These results revealed that HSE-fed goats treated with exogenous Lf exhibited a synergist effect by inducing the reduction of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines.Key Words: lactoferrin, Hibiscus sabdariffa, mastitis PSV-19 Effect of Pressure and Rotation Speed of Tumbling on Shelf-Life of Chicken Breast in Vacuum Tumbling.R.Jahani, Z.Hamidi, H.Ahmadi , Department of Food Science and Technology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran Considering the large demand for marinated chicken breast meat, marinating is one of the most impor - tant processes in poultry industry.Moreover, tumbler machine plays an important role, in view of quality and economics, in marinating in industrial scale.
In this study, 50 kg of chicken breast and 10 L of 3% marinating powder (meat base) were tumbled in a tumbler machine. Consequently, 9 runs of tumbling were performed at dif - ferent values of vacuum percentage (70%, 80% & 90%) and rotation speed (14, 16 & 18 rpm), with the rest of parameters been fixed.Accordingly, the following prop - erties were investigated: fat oxidation, pH, shear force value, expressible moisture value, surface color (= red - ness, =yellowness and = lightness) at two times (after marinating and after aging), and microbial characteris - tics at three times (after marinating, after aging and at the end of the storage).The results indicated maximum reduction in microbial count at the rotation speed and vacuum percentage of 18 rpm and 80%, respectively.Moreover, considering pH and fat oxidation,the rota - tion speed and vacuum percentage of 18 rpm and 90%, respectively, were recommended to achieve optimum outcome.
This is while the rotation speed of 16 rpm and vacuum percentage of 90% showed the best results in terms of expressible moisture and color.

Presently, 250-g portions of used wood chip litter (WCL, 73% dry matter) were treated with 125 mL 0.4 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) contain - ing Chinook or Galena hop extracts to achieve 0.03 g beta-acid/g WCL. Control WCL was treated with buf - fer alone.The WCL was distributed (11 g) to 50-mL tubes (3 tubes/treatment per sampling day), inocu - lated with a marked challenge strain of Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) then capped and incubated at successive 3-day increments at 22oC, 37oC and 42oC.Repeated measures analysis of variance of ammonia, urea and uric acid measured in samples collected on days 0, 3, 6 and 9 revealed a main effect of day on uric acid ( P < 0.05), which increased from day 0 to 3 (a high of 9.4 µmol/g) and declined thereafter to its low (4.1 µmol/g) on day 9.
A day x treatment inter - action was observed ( P < 0.05) on ammonia accumu - lations which increased steadily, accumulating more on day 9 with Galena hops-treated WCL than with control- or Chinook hops-treated WCL (7.3, 6.6 and 5.6 µmol/g, respectively). A main effect of treatment but not day or their interaction was observed on urea accumulations, highest for control, lowest for Galena- and intermediate for Chinook hops-treated WCL (1.7, 0.5 and 1.0 µmol/g, respectively).Analysis of bacterial
