Treatments were arranged as a 2 × 2 fac - torial with steers receiving protein supplements (43% CP) having two levels of protein degradability (35 or 70% RDP) fed at two levels of supplementation, 1.26 or 2.53 g/kg BW (LOW and HIGH). A control treatment providing no supplemental protein was also included (CON).Five 14-d periods were conducted, consisting of 9 d adaptation, 4 d to measure intake and digestion, and 1 d for ruminal fermentation.No degradability × level interactions were observed for any measures of in - take or digestion (P > 0.10).Protein supplementation linearly increased (P < 0.01) total digestible OM intake (TDOMI), NDF intake (P = 0.01), and total digestible NDF intake (DNDFI; P < 0.03).Total digestible OMI was greater in steers receiving 70% RDP than the 35% RDP (P = 0.08).This response resulted from the linear increase in FOMI with 75% RDP (P = 0.03), that was not observed with 35% RDP .
Despite differences in FOMI, TDOMI increased linearly (P ≤ 0.03) for both 35 and 70% RDP, partially the result of providing a highly digestible supplement. Forage OMI differences also resulted in NDFI being greater for 70% RDP than 35% RDP (P = 0.06) and DNDFI increasing lin - early with the addition of both supplements (P ≤ 0.03).Organic matter digestibility (OMD) increased linearly with supplementation as a result of supplement pro - vision.In contrast to observations previously reported in Bos taurus steers, provision of 35% RDP supple - ment did not improve FOMI.Supplementation with 70% RDP improved FOMI 19 and 20% compared to the basal diet at LOW and HIGH levels, respectively.A portion of this relatively modest response to protein supplementation could be attributed to greater intake in the unsupplemented controls.Keywords: forage, protein, cattle PSII-4 Effects of Late Gestation Supplementation of Vitamin B Complex for Beef Cows.Juliana R anches1, Gracia M.
Hernandez1, Aline Rezende1, Matheus Ferreira1, David Bohnert1, 1Oregon State University Abstract: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of late gestation and early lacta - tion supplementation of a vitamin B complex on the performance of beef cows and their calves. A total of 48 mature Angus x Hereford cows were randomly assigned (d0) to one of two treatments (1) vitamin (n = 24) or 1) control (n = 24) in early January, al - lowing for a minimum of 45 days of supplementation before calving and 15 days post-calving.Cows were fed daily with alfalfa hay to the maintenance level.Cows were individually supplemented 3 times weekly (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) with dried distiller’s grains fortified or not with a vitamin B complex.The vitamin B complex was provided at 2/g daily, and there - fore was provided at 4.7g/ feeding event.The vitamin B complex contained pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), folic acid (B9), biotin (B7), and cyanocobalamin (B12).
Cows and calves were considered the experi - ment unit for this study and all data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC, USA).Although all cows were artificially inseminated and pregnancy was checked before the be - ginning of the study, not all cows enrolled in the study calved within the expected calving range.Therefore, a total of 20 calves were born to cows assigned to control treatment and 19 calves were born to cows assigned to the vitamin treatment.No treatment differences (P ≥ 0.21) were observed for initial (d 0) body weight (BW; 1065 vs.1079 lb, respectively for control and vitamin) or body condition score (BCS; 4.7 vs.4.8, respectively for control and vitamin) among cows.No treatment differ - ences (P ≥ 0.34) were observed for BW (1168 vs.1161 lb, respectively for control and vitamin) or BCS (5.3 vs.5.4, respectively for control and vitamin) among cows post-supplementation at turnout (d 90).No differences 27 J.Anim.Sci Vol.100, Suppl.
S4(P = 0.95) were observed for calf birth weight (81.7 lb); however, calves born to cows supplemented with vitamin tended to be heavier at turnout (P = 0.07; 169.7 vs. 180.5 lb, respectively).These results indicate that supplementation of vitamin B complex to beef cows during late gestation might lead to improved perform - ance of offspring shortly after birth.Keywords: calving, calves, vitamin B PSII-5 Endotoxin-Induced Inflammation on Immune Markers and Steroidogenesis in Granulosa Cells.Briza Castro1, Molly Austin1, Craig A.Gifford1, Jennifer A.Hernandez Gifford1, 1New Mexico State University Abstract: Reproductive performance is central to prof - itability in beef cattle operations.Pathogenic stress can result from gram-negative bacteria release of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin which has the potential to accumulate in follicular fluid and impair folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis, leading to re - duced fertility.
Elevated LPS concentrations observed in acute clinical bacterial infections are recognized to have detrimental effects on female fertility, however, definitive effects of low concentrations of LPS present in subclinical or undetectable infection remains to be fully elucidated. This study investigated the effect of varying concentrations of LPS on mechanisms regu - lating ovarian function and subsequent steroidogenesis.A granulosa cell line (KGN) was cultured with or without increasing doses of LPS (0.0001 to 10 µg/mL) for 30 min or 48 h.Cells collected 30 min after treat - ment were analyzed for abundance of phosphorylated proteins and cells collected 48 h after treatment were analyzed for total protein abundance and gene ex - pression.Media were analyzed by radioimmunoassay for steroid hormone concentrations.Quantitative and semi-quantitative PCR was used to evaluate aromatase, beta-catenin, and cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, respect - ively.
No differences were detected among LPS treat - ment groups compared to vehicle-treated controls for protein abundance of total beta-catenin (P = 0.99) or active beta-catenin lacking phosphorylation at serine 33/37 (P = 0.95) evaluated at 48 h. Similar results were observed in protein abundance of phosphorylated forms of beta-catenin at serine 552 (P = 0.98) and 675 (P = 0.85) evaluated at 30 min.Additionally, estradiol concentrations were not different at 0.0001 to 1.0 µg/ mL LPS; however, estradiol was significantly decreased at 10 µg/mL LPS treatment compared to the vehicle- treated control (P = 0.03).Progesterone concentra - tions were also similar within 0.0001 to 1.0 µg/mL LPS treatment groups with a tendency to decrease at 10 µg/mL LPS treatment (P = 0.08) compared to the vehicle- treated control.Varying concentrations of LPS did not change mRNA expression of beta-catenin (P = 0.28), aromatase (P = 0.32), and IL-6 (P = 0.35).
However, a significant increase in cytokine IL-8 mRNA expres - sion was observed at 10 µg/mL LPS compared to the vehicle-treated control (P = 0.04). These findings sug - gest that inflammatory response against LPS at higher concentrations may influence distinct cytokine expres - sion and steroidogenesis.Conversely, basal expression of key steroidogenic enzymes and ovarian steroidogenic modulators are less affected by low concentrations of LPS.Therefore, immune response of granulosa cells is dependent on concentration of LPS exposure that has the ability to impact fertility by modulating the ovarian hormonal and follicular environment.Keywords: granulosa cell, lipopolysaccharide, steroidogenesis
