Kaempferia parvi ﬂora (KP) extract containing methoxy ﬂavones was fed to roosters to improve their reproductive performance. Thirty-two Thai native roosters were orally adminis-tered KP extract at 300, 450, and 600 mg, calculatedaccording to their average body weight, for at least 14 dbefore semen collection and continued supplementationuntil the end of the experiment.The nonsupplementedgroup served as the control.Fresh semen in terms ofsemen volume, sperm concentration, mass movement score, and sperm viability were evaluated.Semen preser- vation at 5°C and fertility test were examined for totalmotility ( MOT ), progressive motility ( PMOT ), sperm viability, and lipid peroxidation up to 48 h of storage.Testosterone concentrations and testicular functionwere also determined.The results showed that the high-est sperm concentration and sperm motility of freshsemen were observed in KP extract at 600 mg ( P< 0.001).
KP extract at 600 mg resulted in higher spermviability than the control and KP extract at 300 mg(P<0.05), but was not different from KP at 450 mg (P>0.05). The highest MOT, PMOT, and viability were found in the roosters that received 600 mg oral KPextract ( P<0.05), while those of the roosters that received oral KP extract 300 mg and the control werethe lowest ( P<0.05) at all storage times.Lipid peroxi- dation was signi ﬁcantly lower in the KP extract up to 24 h(P<0.05).The fertility and hatchability of the KP extract at 600 mg at T48 showed a minor decrease compared to the control at T0.These results might be inferred as a result of good spermatogenesis, as revealedby the results of histological examination and testoster-one activity.In summary, oral administration of 600 mgKP extract improved sperm production and successfullypreserved rooster semen for a long duration of up to 48 hof storage.

They are pop- ular among Thai consumers, especially Pradu Hang dum(PD), because the meat quality is distinctly tastier andmore ﬂavorful than that of broilers with high nutrient content ( Charoensin et al., 2021 ;Tunim et al., 2021 ).Although indigenous chickens raised in tropical areas are more likely to be tolerant to heat stress than those intemperate regions ( Loengbudnark et al., 2023 ), the tem- perature and humidity index ( THI ) values exceeded a threshold of 78 in the rainy and summer seasons foralmost 8 mo per yr, which seemed to decrease the spermproduction of Thai indigenous roosters ( Pimprasert et al., 2023 ).
High sperm production was observed during the winter season owing to low THI. This demonstrates that indigenous Thai roosters were exposed to unsuit-able temperatures and humidity, resulting in a lowerreproductive potential for almost a year.Similarly, /C2112023 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.This is an open access article under the CCBY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/ 4.0/).Received September 11, 2023.Accepted December 7, 2023.1Corresponding author: vibuch@kku.ac.th 1 adverse climate conditions during hot climatic condi- tions severely affect semen production, as semen volume and sperm concentration have been shown in other poul-try (Obidi et al., 2008 ;Harsha et al., 2021 ;Prabakar et al., 2022 ).
Exposure to high ambient temperatures or heat stress (temperature, 40°C §0.5°C; humidity, 63.0 −80.0%) seems to induce abnormality in the spermato- genic cells in chicken testes and reduce testosterone pro-duction, subsequently decreasing the sperm quality (Chen et al., 2015 ). Therefore, it is apparent that any improvement in reproductive performance would posi-tively affect the production of indigenous chickens raisedin tropical areas.Kaempferia parvi ﬂora(KP), popularly known as "Thai ginger" or “Krachaidum ”in Thai, is a medicinal plant in the Zingiberaceae family.It is found in tropicalareas, such as Malaysia, Sumatra, and Thailand.Its rhi- zome has been used in folk medicine for centuries ( Wut- tidharmmavej, 2002 ).The phytochemicals of KP mainly contain methoxy ﬂavones, especially 3,5,7,3 ʹ,4ʹ-pentame- thoxy ﬂavone ( PMF ), 5,7-dimethoxy ﬂavone ( DMF ), and 5,7,4 ʹ-trimethoxy ﬂavone ( TMF )(Mekjaruskul et al., 2012 ).
KP enhances male sexual dysfunction by increasing blood ﬂow to the testis and improving the endothelial cell activity via nitric oxide production, which is necessary for penile erection ( Wattanapitayakul et al., 2007 ;Chaturapanich et al., 2008 ;Temkitthawon et al., 2011 ;Lert-Amornpat et al., 2017 ). The previous study showed that KP improves serum testosterone con-centrations, testicular weight, sperm density, and testic-ular structure in diabetic rats ( Fungfuang et al., 2016 ).Most studies on the application of KP as an additivehave been performed in rodents ( Fungfuang et al., 2016 ; Lert-Amornpat et al., 2017 ), and no research has been conducted on roosters.Therefore, we hypothesized thatsupplementing roosters with KP would improve spermproduction.In addition to improving sperm production, this study focused on semen storage to maintain the sperm qualityover long periods.Generally, rooster-diluted semen isrecommended to be stored at low temperatures of 2°C to 5°C.
For practical reasons, it is desirable to slow its metabolism without seriously decreasing the semenquality for up to 24 h ( Slanina et al., 2015 ). The stressful circumstances of cold storage have a negative impact onsperm, reducing fertility ( Shara ﬁet al., 2015 ).However, it is speculated that the good sperm quality of freshsemen may extend sperm storage.In this study, we investigated the effects of oral KP extract supplementation on testicular function, testos- terone levels, and semen quality.In addition, the highsperm quality of fresh semen could lead to an extendedstorage duration.Fertility capacity was also examined.MATERIALS AND METHODS The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the experimental procedures based on the Ethics of Animal Experimentation guidelines of theNational Research Council of Thailand (Record no.IACUC-KKU-29/65; Reference no.660201.2.11/197 (33)).KP Extraction and Oral Preparation KP was obtained from the Loei Province, Thailand.
Fresh KP was sliced and dried at 60 °C in a hot air ovenfor 48 h before being ground to a powder. The KPextract was prepared by modifying the procedure from Mekjaruskul et al.(2012) .Brie ﬂy, the KP powder was macerated with 95% ethanol in a stainless-steel tank for3 d and evaporated by rotary evaporation.The percent-age of yield of KP extract was 4.71%.The KP extractwas stored at /C020°C for further preparation and formu- lation.The major compounds of methoxy ﬂavones (PMF, DMF, and TMF) in the KP extract were quanti-ﬁed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1200 series, Germany) (modi ﬁed method from Tuntiyasawasdikul et al., 2022 ).The chro- matography separation was performed using an Agilenthypersil ODS column (C18, 3.5 mm particle size, 4.6 mm inner diameter, and 150 mm length) and a controlledtemperature of 30°C.
The mobile phase comprised a mix-ture of 0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile and 0.5% formicacid in deionized water (5:95 −60:40) at a ﬂow rate of 1.2 mL/min (45 min). The injection sample volume was set at 20 mL with a variable wavelength detector (VWD ) detector at a wavelength of 254 nm.The KP ethanolic extract contained 25.19 mg/g, 22.94 mg/g,and 42.54 mg/g for PMF, DMF, and TMF, respectively.The KP formulation was prepared as described by Mekjaruskul et al.(2012) .Brie ﬂy, KP was dissolved (total concentration: 150 mg/mL) in a mixture of pro- pylene glycol (28%), polyethylene glycol 400 (35%), eth- anol (2%), and deionized water (for adjusting to 100%).A 10 mL syringe was used to administer the KP formula-tion.Each treatment was orally administered accordingto body weight.Animals and Management The experiment was conducted using 32 Thai native roosters (Pradu Hang Dum, 38 wk of age) were used inthe present study.
In the open-house system, the roosterswere kept in individual cages (60 £45£45 cm). Before starting the experiment, th ey received 130 g of a commer- cial diet without KP extract supplementation per day.Water was provided ad libi tum throughout the study.Forty-eight Thai native hens (Pradu Hang Dum) at 42 wk of age with egg production >60% were used for the fertility test.The hens were housed individually, fedapproximately 110 g of a commercial diet daily, and pro-vided water ad libitum.The weather information of daily environmental tem- perature and relative humidity in the farm area wasrecorded using an automatic temperature and humidity meter (EL-USB-2, Lascar Electronics, Whiteparish, UK).The temperature and humidity index ( THI ) was2 AUTHAIDA ET AL.calculated according to the National Oceanic and Atmo- spheric Administration (1976) : THI = (1.8 £temp + 32)/C0(0.55 /C00.0055 £RH)£(1.8£temp /C026), where temp is the temperature (°C), and RH is the relativehumidity (%).
The average temperature was 29.28°C,and the relative humidity was 67.93%. The THI was79.29 during the conduct of the experiment.Experimental Design and Sample Collection The roosters were randomly divided into 4 groups (8 roosters per group) according to the concentration of the KP extract (0, 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg body weight).The mean body weight of the rooster was 3.018 kg.Therefore, the roosters in each treatment group wereorally administered the KP extract at doses of 300, 450,and 600 mg.The roosters received KP extract for at least14 d before semen collection and continued supplementa- tion until the end of the ex periment.Fresh semen in terms of semen volume, sperm concentration, mass move- ment score, and sperm viab ility were evaluated.The s e m e nw a sd i l u t e dw i t hs e m e ne x t e n d e ra n ds t o r e da t5°C for 48 h.
The total motility, progressive motility, via-bility, and lipid peroxidation levels were evaluated every 12 h at 0 (after the cooling process), 12, 24, 36, and 48 hof storage. Fertility was evaluated after 0, 24, and 48 h ofstorage.This experiment was repeated 6 times.To determine the testosterone concentrations, blood samples were collected twice: on d 0 of the experiment (before KP extract administration) and at the end of thestudy period (d 120).All roosters were sacri ﬁced by manual cervical dislocation to examine testicular func-tion.The testes were removed from the body, washedwith 0.9% NaCl, and weighed before being ﬁxed in 10% formaldehyde for histopathological examination.Semen Collection, Dilution, and Semen Storage at 5°C The dorso-abdominal massage technique was used to collect semen twice per week.
Individual rooster semen was collected in 1.5 mL microtubes with 0.1 mL ofIGGKPh diluent, which was composed of 0.14 g potas-sium citrate, 1.40 g sodium glutamate, 0.21 g sodiumdihydrogen phosphate, 0.98 g disodium hydrogen phos-phate, 0.9 g glucose, and 0.9 g inositol in 100 mL of deion-ized water; pH was 6.95, and osmotic pressure was 380(mOsm/kg) ( Surai and Wishart, 1996 ). The same person simultaneously collected the samples under the same con- ditions.Great care was taken to avoid contamination ofthe sperm with feces, urates, and clear ﬂuid, all of which degrade sperm quality.Within 20 min of collection, semensamples were transferred to the laboratory and the semenquality was determined.The criteria for a standard qual-ity of sperm as follows: 0.2 to 0.6 mL of volume, spermconcentration ≥3£10 9spermatozoa/mL, and motility ≥80% were pooled to eliminate individual differences and diluted with IGGKPh diluent (1:3).
Then, diluted semenwas placed in a rack, cooled from 25°C to 5°C for 60 min, and maintained in a refrigerator at 5°C. Evaluation of Fresh Semen Quality The volume of ejaculated semen was measured using a 1 mL syringe with an accuracy of 0.02 mL.Thesperm concentration was determined using a hemocy-tometer under a light microscope.One microliter ofsemen sample was diluted with 999 mL of 4% sodium chloride, and 10 mL semen sample was then loaded into each counting chamber.The sperm concentrationis expressed as billions (10 9) of sperm cells/mL.The mass movements were evaluated.A drop of 5 mL semen was placed on a slide without a coverslip,examined under a compound microscope (100 £), and scored on a scale of 0 to 5 (0 = no sperm movement;5 = very rapid waves and whirlwinds visible, withmore than 90% of sperm showing a forward move-ment).Sperm viability was determined using eosin−nigrosin staining.A 5 mL semen sample was mixed with 10 mL of eosin −nigrosin and smeared on the slide.
After drying, 300 sperms were evaluated at1,000£magni ﬁcation under a light microscope (Olym- pus CH30, Tokyo, Japan). Spermatozoa that appearedpink (stained with eosin) were regarded as dead,whereas spermatozoa without any color (no penetra-tion of eosin stain) were regarded as live.The total motility ( MOT ) and progressive motility (PMOT ) were analyzed using a computer-assisted sperm analysis ( CASA ) system (version 10 HIM-IVOS; Hamilton Thorne Biosciences, Beverly, MA) with Olym-pus software to process video material recorded in the“avi”format.For each sample, 2 slides (maintained at 25°C) were ﬁlled with 5 mL diluted semen, and 3 ﬁelds per slide were recorded for 10 s using a 10 £phase-con- trast objective (Olympus) in conjunction with a digital camera (Olympus DP 71/25).They operate at 30 fps (60 Hz).A sperm was de ﬁned as nonmotile when the average path velocity was less than 5 mm/s.
The sperm was considered progressively motile when the averagepath velocity was greater than 20 mm/s and the straightness index was 80%. Lipid Peroxidation Malondialdehyde ( MDA ) concentration, as an index of lipid peroxidation in the semen samples, was mea-sured using the thiobarbituric acid ( TBA ) reaction, as previously described ( Chuaychu-noo et al., 2021 ).Semen samples from each treatment were adjusted to250£10 6spz/mL, then the semen was mixed with 0.25 mL ferrous sulfate (0.2 mM, Ajex, 0906251) and0.25 mL ascorbic acid (1 mM, Sigma, A5960).The sam-ple was incubated at 37°C for 1 h after incubation with1 mL trichloroacetic acid (15%, Sigma, T6399) and 1 mLTBA (0.375%, Sigma, T550) were added and boiled in water for 10 min, after which the samples were cooled to 4°C to stop the reaction.
Finally, the samples wereKRACHAIDUM ORAL ADMINISTERED ON SEMEN QUALITY 3 centrifuged at a controlled temperature of 4°C at 4,000£gfor 10 min and analyzed using UV ‒vis spectro- photometry (Analytikjena Model Specord 250 plus) at532 nm. All MDA concentrations are expressed as nmol/mL.Fertility Forty-eight hens were randomly assigned to 4 groups (12 hens/group) with 6 replications.All hens were inseminated with 0.1 mL (150 £106spermatozoa/dose) of chilled semen once a week.Insemination was per-formed between 03.00 and 05.00 pm.Eggs were obtainedbetween d 2 and 8 after insemination.Candling the eggson d 7 of incubation determined fertility.The hatchabil-ity rate was determined by the hatching of fertile eggsapproximately 21 d after the start of incubation.Testosterone Evaluation The blood samples were collected from the brachial vein twice: on d 0 of the experiment (before KP extractadministration) and at the end of the study (d 120).
Theserum was separated by centrifugation at 2,200 £gfor 15 min at room temperature, stored at /C020°C, and was maintained until testosterone analysis. The testosterone concentrations were quanti ﬁed using enzyme immunoassay ( EIAs ).The 96-well plates were precoated with a secondary antibody diluted in coatingbuffer:150 mL( 1 0 mg/mL) goat anti-rabbit IgG (Arbor Assays) for testosterone EIAs.The coated plates wereprepared by incubating at RT for 15 to 24 h.The wellswere emptied and blotted dry, followed by adding 250 mL blocking buffer (100 mM phosphate, 150 mM sodiumchloride, 1% Tween20, 0.09% sodium azide, 10% sucrose, pH 7.5) and incubating for 15 to 24 h at RT.After incu- bation, the wells were emptied, blotted, and dried in aSanpla Dry Keeper (Sanpla Corp., Auto A-3, Japan)with a loose desiccant at the bottom.After drying(humidity <20%), the plates were heat sealed in a foil bag with a 1-g desiccant packet and stored at 4 ◦C untiluse.
Rooster serum 50 mL (diluted 1:1 with assay buffer) was added to appropriate wells. Subsequently, 25 mLo f steroid horseradish peroxidase conjugate ( HRP ;1 : 2 0 , 0 0 0 dilution) was immediately added to each well, followedby 25 mL of primary antibody (R156/7; 1:110,000 dilu- tion) added to all but nonspeci ﬁc-binding-wells and incu- bated at room temperature for 60 min.The plates werethen washed 4 times with wash buffer, and 100 mLo f TMB substrate solution was added, followed by incuba- tion for 45 to 60 min at room temperature without shak- ing.The assay was validated for rooster serum bydemonstrating parallelism between serial dilutions ofserum and the testosterone standard curve based on Pear-son ’s correlation coef ﬁcient analyses ( r 2= 0.9549).The absorbance was measured at 450 nm.Assay sensitivity(based on 90% binding) was 0.08 ng/mL, and the intra-and interassay CVs were <10% ( Khonmee et al., 2019 ).
Histological Evaluation Testicular tissue was infused with 10% formalin for 24 h. Subsequently, the tissues were processed accordingto the standard histological protocol for paraf ﬁn embed- ding and cut into 3- mm-thick slices as previously described ( Sun et al., 2019 ).Two sections were prepared for each rooster.Thirty seminiferous tubules were ran-domly examined from each section.The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.The sections were viewed under a light microscope.The Johnsen score, aparameter used to categorize the levels of spermatogene-sis based on the presence of the main cell types in theseminiferous tubules, was determined by assigning ascore from 10 to 1 as previously described ( Johnsen, 1970).The numbers of Sertoli cells and sperm clusters were quanti ﬁed as described by Gonz /C19alez-Mor /C19an et al.(2008) using digital slide scanners (3DHISTECH Ltd., Budapest, Hungary).The slides were imaged using a40£microscope objective.
The viewable ﬁeld at this set- ting measured 320 mm£80mm providing a total view- ing area of 25,600 mm 2. Ten microscopic ﬁelds were measured for each testicle, and the average per ﬁeld was Figure 1.Histological structures of rooster testis stained with hematoxylin and eosin at 100 £magni ﬁcation (A).Parameters of evaluated histol- ogy (B).Scale bar = 200 mm (A) and 50 mm (B).4 AUTHAIDA ET AL.calculated.The diameter of the seminiferous tubules and germinal epithelial width were measured using a digitalslide scanner (3DHISTECH Ltd., Budapest, Hungary)at 400£magni ﬁcation.Figure 1 shows the histological examination of the seminiferous tubules, which consistedof the parameter evaluation in the present study.Statistical Analysis Before conducting statistica la n a l y s i si ne a c he x p e r i - ment, the data were tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro −Wilk test.The homogeneity of the residual variances was eliminated using the Levene ’st e s ta n do u t - lier data.
In the fresh semen experiment, data were ana-lyzed using a completely randomized design, and thetreatment groups (KP extract supplement) were com-pared using Tukey ’sp o s th o ct e s t .I nt h ec o l d - s e m e n experiment, a completely randomized design using 6 rep- licates with a split-plot over time was analyzed. Two fac-tors were statistically analyzed: the ﬁrst factor was 4 levels of treatment (KP extract supplement) at 0, 300,450, and 600 mg of KP extract, and the second factor was 5 levels of time to semen storage at 0, 12, 24, 36, and48 h after the cooling process.Finally, the testosteroneand testicular function experiments used the same experi-mental design as the cool-semen experiment for statisticalanalysis.The only differen ce was the time of serum tes- tosterone level detection, which was compared before and after testing.
The effects of treatment (KP extract sup- plementation), time to stor age, and their interaction mean values for each parameter were compared usingTukey ’s post hoc test. They were considered statistically signiﬁcant at P<0.05, and the results are expressed as mean values §mean square error ( MSE ).RESULTS Effects of KP Extract on Fresh Semen Quality The effects of oral administration of KP extract on the quality of fresh semen are shown in Table 1 .The highest concentration and mass movement were observed withTable 1.Effects of treatments on fresh semen quality in a rooster (mean §SEM).

Oral KP extract of 600 mg resulted in higher sperm viability thanthe control and KP extract at 300 mg ( P<0.05).There was no signi ﬁcant difference in the volume of fresh semen among the treatment groups ( P>0.05).Effects of KP Extract on Cold Semen Storage The effects of the KP extract on semen quality after storage at 5°C for 48 h are presented in Table 2 .The interaction between treatment and storage time was sig-niﬁcant for sperm quality and lipid peroxidation ( P< 0.05).Sperm quality (MOT, PMOT, and viability) con- tinued to decrease with increasing storage time ( P< 0.05), whereas MDA concentration increased withincreasing storage time ( P<0.05).
The highest MOT, PMOT, and viability were found in the roosters thatreceived 600 mg of oral KP extract ( P<0.05), while those of the roosters that received oral KP extract100 mg and the control were the lowest ( P<0.05) at all storage times. A signi ﬁcant difference in MDA levels was observed at 0, 12, and 24 h ( P<0.05).However, no signiﬁcant differences were observed after 36 and 48 h of storage ( P>0.05).Effects of KP Extract on Fertility The effects of the KP extract on semen quality after storage at 5°C for 48 h are presented in Table 3 .The interaction effect between treatment and storage timewas signi ﬁcant for the percent of fertility ( P<0.05) but not for the percent of hatchability ( P>0.05).The per- centage of fertility and hatchability was decreased when semen was used with increasing storage time ( P<0.05).
At T0, the highest fertility was observed in eggs fertil- ized by the semen of the roosters that received oral KPextract of 600 mg ( P<0.05), while those fertilized by the semen of the roosters in the control were the lowest(P<0.05). At T24 and T48, fertility was comparable between eggs fertilized with the semen of the roosters that received oral KP extract 600 mg and 450 mg ( P> 0.05), but higher than that of the ones fertilized by thesemen of roosters that received 300 mg oral KP extractand the control ( P<0.05).Notably, 600 mg KP extract (74.67 vs.69.96%) showed a higher and minor decrease,respectively, compared to the control at T0 (71.45%).The highest hatchability was observed in eggs fertil- ized with the semen of roosters that received 600 mg of oral KP extract at all storage times ( P<0.05).The hatchability percentages were not signi ﬁcantly different among the other 3 groups at the same storage time ( P> 0.05).
Effects of KP Extract on Testis Weight, Testis Size, and Testicular Function The effects of KP extract on testis weight and size are presented in Table 4 . There were signi ﬁcant differences in testis weight among the treatments.The weight ofthe testes was higher in the roosters that received600 mg and 450 mg of oral KP extract, whereas it was lower in the roosters that received oral KP extractTable 3.Effects of treatments with different times to storage during 0, 24, and 48 h on the percent fertility and hatchability (mean § SEM).

Testosterone concentrations increased at the end of the study com- pared to those at the beginning of the treatment ( P< 0.05).Before treatment, testosterone concentrationswere not signi ﬁcantly different between the groups ( P> 0.05).After treatment or at the end of the study, roos-ters receiving oral KP extract of 450 and 600 mg had sig-niﬁcantly higher plasma testosterone concentrations than the other groups ( P<0.05).DISCUSSION Sperm production in roosters is affected by various fac- tors, including breed, age, nutrition, and environment.Intropical regions, high environmental temperature andhumidity cause heat stress in poultry, subsequentlydecreasing the growth rate ( Boonkum et al., 2021 )a n d resulting in detrimental effects on semen production (Obidi et al., 2008 ;Harsha et al., 2021 ;Prabakar et al., 2022).
Therefore, there is a need to investigate whether any improvement in the reproductive performance posi-tively affects the production of indigenous chicken raisedin tropical areas. In this study, the levels of KP extractsupplements in ﬂuenced the reproductive function of roos- ters, in which the oral administration of 600 mg KP extract was satisfactory in almost all sperm parameters.The KP extract improved fresh semen quality by increas-ing sperm concentration, mass movement, viability, anddecreasing lipid peroxidation.Although the semen qual-ity decreased as the storage time increased, the KPextract supplement at 600 mg could enhance the semenquality after cold storage at 5°C for 48 h compared to theothers.Furthermore, the fertility and hatchability of the KP extract 600 mg at T48 showed a minor decrease com- pared to the control at T0.
These results might beinferred as a result of good spermatogenesis, as revealedby the results of histological examination and testoster-one concentrations. The quality of fresh semen is required to produce higher sperm doses and extend fertility until it is usedfor arti ﬁcial insemination to reach maximum fertility.However, increasing environmental temperature and rel- ative humidity with the threshold points of THI at 78seem to decrease sperm production, especially spermconcentration, in Thai native roosters and pigeons(Wannaratana et al., 2021 ;Pimprasert et al., 2023 ).Exposure to heat stress can induce abnormalities in sper-matogenesis and decrease testosterone production ( Chen et al., 2015 ;Xiong et al., 2020 ).In the present study, roosters were raised in an open-house system with an average THI of 79.29, considering exposure to heatstress.
Therefore, sperm concentration was obviouslyaffected ( Table 1 ); however, the oral administration of 600 mg could improve the fresh semen quality byincreasing sperm concentration, and other sperm param-eters. A previous study on diabetic rats reported thatKP extract supplementation increased sperm density, testosterone concentrations, and histological features of the testes ( Fungfuang et al., 2016 ).The present study examined the histological charac- teristics and testosterone concentrations to elucidate how KP enhances fresh semen quality.The oral adminis-tration of KP extract (600 mg) had a positive effect onthe testicular structure by increasing testicular functions(Table 5 ) and testosterone concentrations ( Table 6 ).It has been reported that spermatic blood ﬂow was markedly increased after treatment with KP extract; inother words, KP has a vasodilatory effect ( Chaturapa- nich et al., 2008 ).
KP extract contains several ﬂavo- noids, such as PMF, which relax the human corpuscavernosum and improve blood ﬂow (Jansakul et al., 2012). Meanwhile, the DMF induced dilatation of the arteries ( Temkitthawon et al., 2011 ) and enhanced tes- tosterone production through cAMP in rat testiculartumor cells ( Horigome et al., 2014 ).Therefore, it might be implied that increasing blood ﬂow to the testis would stimulate testosterone production and secretion ( Dam- ber and Janson, 1978 ) by acting directly on the Sertoli cells to stimulate spermatogenesis ( O’Donnell et al., 1994), subsequently impacting testicular function and sperm development ( Prabakar et al., 2022 ).Further- more, testicular blood ﬂow was related to testicular weight ( Wang et al., 1983 ); thus, an increase in the tes- ticular weight was also observed in the present study (Table 4 ).
Therefore, we inferred that the oral adminis- tration of 600 mg KP to roosters leads to increased tes-tosterone concentrations and subsequently enhancesspermatogenesis by improving sperm production. The percentage of good sperm in cold-storage semen depends mainly on fresh semen quality.How-ever, lipid peroxidation is an important aspect of theoxidative stress that occurs during dilution and cool- ing incubation, which shortens the lifespan of cold- stored semen ( Shara ﬁet al., 2015 ).Besides, the poul- try sperm cell structure contains a high amount ofpolyunsaturated fatty acids, which are sensitive tolipid peroxidation in the presence of reactive oxygenspecies ( ROS ), resulting in sperm DNA damage and decreased sperm motility ( Cerolini et al., 2006 ;Gho- lami et al., 2010 ;Partyka et al., 2012 ), which is a consequence of plasma membrane dysfunction, lead- ing to decreased fertilizing ability.
Therefore, antioxi-dants that act as free radical scavengers, have beenproposed as semen extender additives to improvesemen preservation. In the present study, 600 mg ofKP extract reduced lipid peroxidation for up to 24 h.Accordingly, the sperm quality of cooled stored semenwas enhanced ( Table 2 ).This might be highly bene ﬁ- cial as an antioxidant in KP.It was reported that the TMP, one of the major methoxy ﬂavone components in KP extraction, can reduce the produc-tion of intravascular ROS ( Horigome et al., 2014 ).However, the antioxidant properties were no longerobserved after 36 h of storage.This may be due toinsuf ﬁc i e n ta n t i o x i d a n t si nt h es e m e no re x c e s s i v e ROS formation, leading to higher MDA values over time ( Agarwal et al., 2003 ).In addition, heat stress mainly caused a decrease in the antioxidant enzymeactivity and disrupted the b alance between oxidative8 AUTHAIDA ET AL.
and antioxidative status in seminal plasma ( Xiong et al., 2020 ), suggesting that high environmental tem- peratures could accelerate lipid peroxidation, result-ing in high ROS in semen storage. Successful fertilization is related to the quality of the cool storage of semen.Little information is available onthe use of cold-stored semen after 24 h, especially regard-ing its fertility capacity.Notably, the fertility rates ofthe roosters that received 600 mg of oral KP extract and stored for up to 48 h showed a higher and minor decrease compared with control at T0 ( Table 3 ).This result was superior to previous studies that supplemented creatineas an antioxidant to diluent with a maximum fertilityrate in Vietnamese native chickens at 48 h after storageof approximately 60% ( Bui et al., 2021 ).
However, our previous study, in which a solid storage medium wassupplemented with serine as an antioxidant, showed a greater fertility capacity when compared to the same storage time ( Kheawkanha et al., 2023 ). A dif- ference in the extender and antioxidant supplementa-tion may be noted in this case.Therefore, consideringthe results of sperm preservation and fertility, supple-mentation with antioxidants as semen additives inthe extender should be considered to improve coldsemen preservation.In the present study, roosters that received 600 mg of KP extract orally showed the most remarkable perfor-mance in terms of sperm production, semen preserva-tion, and fertility capacity.However, it seems plausiblethat a high dose of oral KP in the rooster diet mighthave a greater impact on these parameters.However, itis important to note that KP is extracted with alcohol toproduce the active components of methoxy ﬂavones (Sutthanut et al., 2007 ).
Despite the alcohol being removed from the KP extract prior to consumption, thetaste and ﬂavor are undesirable for the rooster, subse- quently declining to eat. Hence, in this experiment, it isnecessary to administer the KP dose using a syringe toachieve more accurate quanti ﬁcation.Meanwhile, the oral bioavailability of methoxy ﬂavones is extremely poor, and they are lipophilic molecules immiscible in water ( Mekjaruskul et al., 2012 ).Several techniques have been developed to enhance the solubility and bio-availability of methoxy ﬂavones.Mekjaruskul et al.(2013) reported that a complex of cyclodextrin and KP successfully increased the dissolution rate, improveddrug permeability in Caco-2 cells, and enhanced the oralbioavailability of methoxy ﬂavones.Unfortunately, cyclodextrin tends to be expensive; therefore, it is unsuitable for producing animal feed.In addition, Chairuk et al.
(2020) developed a self-nano-emulsifying drug delivery system ( SNEDDS ) of KP that can increase the area under the curve ( AUC ), the concen- tration of a drug in the bloodstream over time after ithas been taken, by 5.38 times compared to the KPextract. However, high concentrations of surfactantscan trigger gastrointestinal irritation.Therefore, addi- tional product development by improving oral bioavail- ability may be required to enhance taste and ﬂavor, which are appropriate for animal supplements.CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, this is the ﬁrst report on the use of KP extract in livestock.Roosters that received 600 mg oforal KP extract showed the most remarkable perfor-mance in terms of sperm production, semen preserva- tion, and fertility.However, it seems plausible that a high dose of oral KP in the rooster diet might have agreater impact on these parameters.Therefore, addi-tional product development is required to improve thetaste and ﬂavor of animal supplements.
