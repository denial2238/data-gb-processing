Data on variables such as age, gender,presence of distant metastasis, smoking history, other thera- peutic interventions, and the speci ﬁc TKI used were collected for analysis. Cox regression analysis revealed that patientswith higher Mg levels prior to EGFR-TKI therapy had signi ﬁ- cantly longer progression-free s urvival (PFS) and overall sur- vival (OS).Elevated Mg levels remained predictive of PFS andOS after two cycles of EGFR-TKI therapy.Multiple regres- sion analysis con ﬁrmed these ﬁndings.Additionally, it was observed that smokers might represent a unique population,demonstrating a correlation between OS and Mg levels.Ourﬁndings indicate that serum Mg level is a prognostic factor in patients with NSCLC undergoin g EGFR-TKI therapy.This mayprovide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of EGFR-TKI therapy related to electrolyte balance.

NSCLC is the mostprevalent form of lung cancer, signi ﬁcantly contributing to cancer-associated morbidity and mortality.The introduc- tion of targeted therapeutic interventions and lifestyle modiﬁcations has reduced the impact of lung cancer on human health [1 ].Targeted and immunotherapy-based treatments have notably improved survival rates for patients with NSCLC [2].Since 1991, reports from the Amer-ican Cancer Society and Cancer Statistics Center have shown a steady decline in the cancer mortality rate, with lung cancer experiencing the most pronounced declineamong the four leading cancers between 2014 and 2018 [3].
Despite the e ﬀectiveness of targeted therapy for NSCLC, drug resistance remains a signi ﬁcant challenge. Throughout the treatment course with ﬁrst- and second-generation epi- dermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), a substantial proportion of patients experience disease progression due to inadequate therapeutic responsesagainst the T790M mutation and other acquired resistance mechanisms [4 ].The expanding array of targeted pharma- cotherapeutic agents approved for clinical use has signi ﬁ- cantly enhanced the management of patients with NSCLC with metastatic EGFR mutations, particularly those harboring the acquired EGFR T790M mutation, who show progressiondespite ongoing EGFR-TKI treatm ent [4,5].
Early detection of disease progression and information about drug resistance are crucial for timely drug adjustments and essential for prolonging patient survival and enhancing the quality of life.Fang-Zhou Xu, Fu-Rong Meng, Wan-Jing Li: Department of Geriatric Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First A ﬃliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, Anhui, China; Anhui GeriatricInstitute, Hefei, 230001, Anhui, ChinaLu Xu, Hao Zhang, Yan-Bei Zhang: Department of Geriatric Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First A ﬃliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, Anhui, China * Corresponding author: Xiao-Yun Fan, Department of Geriatric Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First A ﬃliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No.

Frequent hypomagnesemia is a signi ﬁcant predictor of decreased survival in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing chemora-diotherapy [8]. However, the relationship between hypomagne-semia and the prognosis of EGFR-TKI therapy for NSCLC has been infrequently studied.We hypothesize that Mg levels corre- late with prognosis following EGFR-TKI therapy.2 Method 2.1 Patient enrollment From March 2016 to October 2021, 91 patients with NSCLC andEGFR mutations received EGFR-TKI therapy at the FirstAﬃliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University.The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (i) a con ﬁrmed diag- nosis of NSCLC with a clear pathological type; (ii) next-genera- tion sequencing to identify speci ﬁc genetic mutations; and (iii) completion of more than two cycles of oral EGFR-TKI therapy, with the ﬁrst eﬀective evaluation conducted after 60 days of treatment.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) patientswith histologically mixed small cell carcinoma or small cell carcinoma; (ii) patients who were lost to follow-up or deceased within two months of treatment initiation; and (iii)patients with an active infection or kidney disease, as theseconditions could a ﬀect hematology laboratory marker values. Informed consent: Informed consent has been obtained from all individuals included in this study.Ethical approval: The research related to human use has been complied with all the relevant national regulations, institutional policies and in accordance with the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration, and has been approved by theEthics Committee of The First A ﬃliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (No.Quick-PJ 2023-12-60).
2.2 Data statistics Overall survival (OS) was the primary endpoint, while pro- gression-free survival (PFS) was the secondary endpoint.OS was measured from the initiation of EGFR-TKI therapy until all-cause mortality or the date of the last follow-up.PFS was de ﬁned as the period from the initiation of TKI therapy to disease progression, tumor metastasis, or all- cause death. Evaluations were conducted monthly duringthe initial two months following the commencement of EGFR TKI therapy, and subsequently, at three-month intervals.Comprehensive assessments were promptly con-ducted upon the exacerbation or emergence of new symp- toms.The amalgamation of clinical data with ﬁndings from chest computed tomography (CT) scans was utilizedto appraise therapeutic e ﬃcacy, in accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1).
Variables extracted included age, gender, distant metas- tasis, smoking history, body mass index (BMI), other treat- ments (thoracic surgery, chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and radiotherapy), concomitant diseases (stroke,arterial hypertension, diabetes, and cardiopathy), and the choice of TKI. Non-smokers were de ﬁned as patients who had never smoked, while smokers were de ﬁned as those who had a history of smoking or had not quit smoking at the time of their cancer diagnosis.Additionally, liver and kidney function, as well as electrolyte levels (includingMg, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), bloodurea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr), alanine ami- notransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), was evaluated prior to and after two cycles ofTKI treatment.2.3 Statistical analyses Continuous variables are expressed as means ±standard deviations.Univariate prognostic variables were screenedusing Cox regression analysis.
The relationship between Mg levels and PFS and OS before and after therapy was evaluated using a multiple logistic regression model withadjustments for confounding factors. Hazard ratios (HR)are reported as relative risks with corresponding 95% con ﬁ- dence intervals (CI) and were derived using Cox regression analysis.Survival curves w ere plotted using the Kaplan –Meier method and log-rank test.The optimal cuto ﬀMg level was determined using the surv_cutpoint algorithm of the survival Rp a c k a g e[ 9 ,10].Finally, interactions between the Mg level and the other variables were ex amined.Statistical signi ﬁcance was set at P<0.05.Statistical analyses were conducted using Empower®(www.empowerstats.com; X&Y Solutions, Inc., Boston, MA, USA), R (http://www.R-project.org), and R soft- ware (version 4.2.0) [11].2 Fang-Zhou Xu et al.3 Results 3.1 Patient demographics This study included 91 NSCLC patients who underwent EGFR-TKI therapy.
Comprehensive patient demographicdata are presented in Table 1 . The median age of the patients was 61.57 years, and 52.75% were male.Among the cohort, 44 patients (48.35%) received chemotherapy prior to oral TKI treatment.Additionally, six patients (6.59%) under- went radiofrequency ablation, two patients (2.20%) underwent thoracotomy, and three patien ts (3.30%) underwent radio- therapy.Ge ﬁtinib was the most frequ ently prescribed EGFR- TKI, followed by icotinib and erl otinib.Thirty-one patients were diagnosed with arterial hyp ertension, 22 with diabetes, seven had a history of stroke, and four had a history of cor-onary heart disease.3.2 Prognostic factors before EGFR-TKI therapy The results of the univariate analysis of liver function, renal function, electrolytes, and medical history prior totherapy are displayed in Table 2 .Cox regression analysis revealed that age and gender had little in ﬂuence on OS and PFS.
Renal function and other common electrolytes, suchas K, P, and Ca, also had negligible e ﬀects on prognosis. ALT and AST had a negligible impact on PFS but had a protective e ﬀect on OS.Hypertension, diabetes, history of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and historyof smoking were risk factors for prognosis after EGFR-TKI therapy, though this trend was not statistically signi ﬁcant.Patients with higher Mg levels before EGFR-TKI therapyhad signi ﬁcantly higher PFS and OS ( P=0.0100 and P= 0.0092, respectively).

After adjusting for variables such as gender, age, SCr, BUN, ALT, AST, disease history, and other treatments, the predictiveeﬀect on PFS and OS remained signi ﬁcant (HR =0.02; 95% CI=0.00–0.05; P =0.0216; HR =0.00; 95% CI =0.00–0.06; P= 0.0017). 3.3 Survival curves before EGFR-TKI therapy Using the surv_cutpoint function in the survival R package, we determined the optimal cuto ﬀMg level for OS, which was 0.87 mmol/L based on the 91 patients in the studycohort.Consequently, the patients were divided into the high and low Mg level groups, comprising 55 (60.44%) and 36 (39.56%) patients, respectively.The median PFS in the high Mg group was 369 days (range: 323 –478 days) compared to that of 275 days (range: 223 –363 days) in the low Mg group.The survival curve analysis showed that PFS was signi ﬁcantly higher in the high Mg group than in the low Mg group ( P=0.023; Figure 1 ).
Similarly, OS was higher in the high Mg group (mean: 1,026 days; range: 825 –NA days) compared to that in the low Mg group (mean: 517 days; range: 450 –846 days). Moreover, the di ﬀerence in OS between the high Mg and low Mg groups was highly statistically signi ﬁcant ( P=0.00089).3.4 Prognostic factors after two EGFR-TKI treatment cycles Given the excellent pre-treatment data, we further evalu- ated changes in liver and kidney function, electrolytes, andother parameters after two treatment cycles (Table 4 ).

Notably, only Mg remained statistically signi ﬁcant in terms of PFS, with an HR of 0.01 (95% CI: 0.00 –0.07; P=0.0001), whereas the P value associated with calcium was greater than 0.05, indi- cating a lack of statistical signi ﬁcance. For OS, changes in electrolyte levels were the most signiﬁcant, with Mg and Ca being statistically signi ﬁcant factors.High Ca levels were protective for prognosis (HR = 0.01; 95% CI: 0.00 –0.22; P=0.0023).Since Ca values were only signi ﬁcant for OS after therapy, no additional research was conducted on this parameter.Multiple regression analysis using the Cox survival model (Table 5 ) adjusted for variables such as gender, age, SCr, BUN, ALT, AST, disease history, and other treat- ments.
Changes in Mg levels continued to exhibit a pre- dictive e ﬀect on both PFS (HR =0.00; 95% CI: 0.00 –0.06; P<0.0001) and OS (HR =0.00; 95% CI: 0.00 –0.20; P= 0.0056).3.5 Survival curves after EGFR-TKI therapy The surv_cutpoint function within the survival R package was used again to determine the optimal Mg cuto ﬀvalue for OS, which was 0.73 mmol/L. There were 81 patients(89.01%) in the high Mg group and 10 patients (10.99%) in the low Mg group.The median PFS for patients in the high Mg group was 363 (range: 289 –427) days, which was sig- niﬁcantly higher than the 204 (range: 136 –360) days for patients in the low Mg group.The survival curve revealed that the PFS was signi ﬁcantly prolonged in the high Mg group ( P=0.0012).The survival curve for OS produced identical results.The median survival time in the high Mg group (876 days; range: 734 –NA days) was higher than that in the low Mg group (346 days; range: 225 –876 days).
There were signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences between groups in terms of OS ( P=0.00091; Figure 2 ). The survival R package was used to determine the optimal Mg cuto ﬀ levels after therapy.These cuto ﬀlevels for serum Mg were lower than the normal range.Therefore, we divided the patients into low (group 1) and high (group 4) groupsbased on their Mg levels (8 –10).The Mg levels were lowest in group 1.The univariate Cox regression analysis was repeated, and related variables were adjusted.The resultsshowed that group 1 was signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent from the other three groups (Table 6).These outcomes suggest that patients with low Mg levels following TKI therapy have a considerably poorer prognosis compared to otherpatients.Table 5: Multiple regression equation of Mg after two cycles of EGFR-TKI treatment Adjust I Adjust II PFS 0.01 (0.00, 0.09) 0.0002 0.00 (0.00, 0.06) < 0.0001 OS 0.01 (0.00, 0.25) 0.0073 0.00 (0.00, 0.20) 0.0056 Adjust I model: adjust for –gender; age.

Similarly, Mg levels were more strongly correlated with the outcomes of oral EGFR-TKItherapy in women than in men (HR <0.0001 vs HR =0.1667; P=0.008). Post-therapy, Mg levels demonstrated a speci ﬁc predic- tive eﬀect for OS only in smokers (HR <0.0001 vs HR = 0.1332; P=0.0183), but not for gender.

4 Discussion The majority of patients eventually develop resistance to EGFR- TKI drugs, leading to disease pro gression. Consequently, most patients require regular evaluations using CT and nuclearimaging.However, the limitations of imaging techniques in capturing cellular metabolism hinder the timely detection of disease progression and the modi ﬁcation of treatment plans.Therefore, exploring the relationship between tumor-speci ﬁc or other relevant blood mark ers and prognosis following EGFR-TKI therapy is rational [12 ,13].Compared to other studies, in our study, we examined the data after two treatment cycles.Based on the results, we propose that patients with extremely low Mg levelsfollowing TKI therapy have a signi ﬁcantly poorer prog- nosis compared to other patients.
Furthermore, the inter- action test revealed that reduced Mg levels are more likely to be a risk factor in patients with a history of smoking.This observation aligns with previous research, whichidentiﬁed hypomagnesemia as a prognostic indicator of unfavorable outcomes in che moradiotherapy for head and neck cancer [8 ]. Similarly, clinical studies suggest that depleted Mg levels constitute a risk facto r for hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [14].Mg, an abundant bivalent cation in the human body, is primarily stored in skeletal muscle, soft tissue, and bone.Hormones or drugs rarely directly a ﬀect Mg levels, which are primarily regulated by intestinal absorption and renal excretion [15 ].Mg is absorbed through two channel proteins: transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) channel types 6and 7.
TRPM7 is widespread, w hereas TRPM6 is the primary absorption channel for Mg and is found primarily in the kid- neys, distal small intestine, and colon [16]. The epidermalgrowth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) regulate the activity of the Mg channel TRPM6.Abnormal activation of EGF causes TRPM6 in the cytoplasm of renal cells to move toward the cellmembrane, resulting in increased Mg reabsorption [17,18].Consequently, EFGR inhibitors could theoretically a ﬀect mag- nesium absorption and induce hyp omagnesemia.Consistent with this theory, several studies have reported that the treatment oftumors with EGFR monoclonal antibodies induces hypomagne- semia.Patients treated with cetuximab, alone or in combina- tion with other therapies, have been reported to experiencehypomagnesemia [19 –21].

activity, reduce Mg in ﬂux into cells, and inhibit renal Mg reab- sorption. Mutations in the TRPM6 gene, which encodes theepithelial Mg channel, result in secondary hypocalcemia; changes in renal function also a ﬀect Mg levels [22,23].There- fore, after adjusting for liver and kidney function, K, Ca, andother electrolytes in the multiple regression analysis, the outcomes of our study remained relatively unchanged.This further demonstrated the predictive nature of Mgin EGFR-TKI treatment.So far, no signi ﬁcant clinical trials have demonstrated a clear correlation between EGFR-TKI (ge ﬁtinib, erlotinib, or lapatinib) and hypomagnesemia [24 ,25].Unlike anti- EGFR monoclonal antibodies, the precise e ﬀect of EGFR-TKI on hypomagnesemia remains u nclear.Dimke et al.demon- strated that erlotinib can alter EGF-stimulated TRPM6 channelactivity at the cellular level.
However, animal studies indicate that normal therapeutic doses of erlotinib have no signi ﬁcant eﬀect on serum Mg levels in humans [26]. Mg is a crucial element required to form the active structures of protein kinases, including receptor tyrosine kinases [27 ].Cellular studies indicate that high Mg levels can increase tyrosine kinase activity, as both enzyme activity and phosphate transfer require Mg molecules.The Mg-adenosine triphosphate complex binds proteinsubstrates and catalyzes energy for signaling pathwaytransmission [28 –30].Thus, it can be inferred that Mg levels promote EGFR-related pathways.
Thus, it can be inferred that Mg levels promote EGFR-related pathways.We hypothesize that patients with elevated serum Mg levels who are treated with EGFR-TKI may have longer PFS and OS based on the following: EGFR mutations leadto increased Mg absorption; that is, elevated Mg levels indicate that EGFR mutations account for a higher propor- tion of tumor development, thereby increasing the sensi-tivity of EGFR-TKI treatment. Further research is requiredto con ﬁrm these hypotheses.Interaction tests demonstrated that gender and smoking factors interacted with Mg levels, while smoking alone inter-acted with Mg levels both before and after therapy.In a large clinical study of esophageal cancer, the interaction between Mg intake and smoking was statistically signi ﬁcant [31 ].However, this study showed a strong positive correla- tion between Mg and the incidence of esophageal adenocar- cinoma among non-smokers than among smokers.In ourstudy, smokers also represented a special group.
In patients with prognostic risk factors, such as those over 65 years of age, those with a history of hypertension and other diseases,and those with a low BMI, Mg tended to be a protectivefactor for OS, although this was not statistically signi ﬁcant. Chemotherapy utilizing platinum-based agents can impair renal function and result in hypomagnesemia, while anti-EGFRmonoclonal antibody therapy can a ﬀe c tM ga b s o r p t i o n .Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that magne-sium supplementation prior to or during treatment enhances patient outcomes [32 –34].A study by Minzi et al.revealed that supplementing electrolytes can reduce the risk of nephrotoxi-city caused by chemotherapy with cisplatin [32].Therefore, in combination with our study results, we hypothesize that exo- genous electrolyte supplementation during EGFR-TKI therapymay aﬀect therapeutic e ﬃcacy, particularly in patients with a history of smoking and other risk factors.
However, no studies have reported this previously; therefore, additional clinicaltrials are required to verify these results. Our research had several limitations.First, it was a retro- spective study with a limited sample size; therefore, bias was inevitable.Second, we did not investigate the e ﬀect of elec- trolyte supplementation on prognosis during therapy.Third, additional follow-up is required to determine the impact of a steady increase in Mg levels on treatment outcomes.5 Conclusion Ourﬁndings indicate that maintaining a high Mg level is a signiﬁcant predictor of PFS and OS in patients with NSCLC undergoing EGFR-TKI therapy.Smokers may represent a unique population demonstrating a signi ﬁcant relation- ship between OS and Mg levels.These results providenew insight into the underlying mechanisms of EGFR-TKI therapy associated with electrolyte balance.
