Abstract: Adolescent binge drinking is a social problem with a long-lasting impact on cognitive functions. The cannabinoid type-1 (CB 1) receptor of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in brain synaptic plasticity, cognition and behavior via receptor localization at speciﬁc subcellular compartments of the cortical, limbic and motor regions.Alcohol (EtOH) intake affects the ECS, CB 1 and their functions.Evidence indicates that binge drinking during adolescence impairs memory via the abrogation of CB 1-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.However, the impact of EtOH consumption on global CB 1receptor expression in the adult brain is unknown.We studied this using optical density analysis throughout brain regions processed for light microscopy (LM) immuno- histotochemistry.CB 1staining decreased signiﬁcantly in the secondary motor cortex, cerebellum, cingulate cortex, amygdala and nucleus accumbens.
Next, as omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) rescue synaptic plasticity and improve EtOH-impaired cognition, we investigated whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) had any effect on CB 1recep- tors. N-3 intake during EtOH abstinence restored CB 1immunostaining in the secondary motor cortex, cerebellum and amygdala, and ameliorated receptor density in the cingulate cortex.These results show that n-3 supplementation recovers CB 1receptor expression disrupted by EtOH in distinct brain regions involved in motor functions and cognition.Keywords: ethanol; polyunsaturated fatty acids; endocannabinoid system; immunohistochemistry; motor system; cognition; rodent 1.Introduction The ECS system is mainly composed of endocannabinoids (eCBs), the enzymes in- volved in their synthesis and degradation, as well as cannabinoid receptors [ 1].
The cannabinoid CB 1, the most abundant G-protein-coupled receptor in the brain, is highly expressed in the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, cerebellum (Cb) and hippocampus, which is consistent with its role in learning and memory, motor control, motivation, reward and emotional processing, among many others [ 1,2]. Furthermore, CB 1increases and changes its distribution from adolescence to adulthood, is predominantly localized in presynaptic terminals and noticeably present in glial cells and mitochondria, modulates neurotransmitter release and also participates in synaptic plasticity [1–5].Binge drinking during adolescence has a long-lasting impact on cognition and behav- ior via interference with brain neurochemical systems, including the ECS which participates in the regulation of motivation and EtOH intake [ 6–9].EtOH exposure alters both CB 1 Int.J.Mol.Sci.2023 ,24, 17316.https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242417316 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms Int.J.Mol.Sci.
2023 ,24, 17316 2 of 14 mRNA and protein [ 10,11], changing the availability and binding of the receptor [ 12,13]. Conversely, gene deletion and CB 1receptor antagonism affect drinking behavior [ 14].In addition, a CB 1mRNA decrease in the adult hippocampus after adolescent binge drinking correlates with CB 1receptor reduction in excitatory terminals of the hippocampal dentate molecular layer.These changes, together with the rise in monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) mRNA, the main degrading enzyme of the eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), disrupt endocannabinoid-dependent long-term depression (LTD) and set off memory impair- ment [ 15].Remarkably, the 2-AG increase elicited by MAGL inhibition recovers synaptic plasticity and cognition [ 15].Although pharmacological manipulations are potential ther- apeutic strategies for treating alcohol-induced long-term cognitive deﬁcits, nutritional supplementation might also stand up as a suitable alternative.
DHA and EPA are n-3 PUFAs that accumulate in brain cell membranes and maintain their structure and ﬂuidity, restore glutathione levels, are anti-inﬂammatory, reduce oxida- tive stress and apoptosis, and overcome synaptic plasticity deﬁcits, improving the cognitive impairment caused by prenatal EtOH exposure [ 16–19]. DHA is unevenly distributed among brain regions and between neurons and glial cells, and participates in membrane- associated protein functions, cellular signaling, gene expression, lipogenesis, neurogenesis and synaptic pruning [ 16].EtOH decreases n-3 via different mechanisms [ 20,21].The negative impact of EtOH on DHA alters synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, both enriched in DHA under normal conditions [ 16].
Noticeably, the en- hancement of eCB signaling recovers emotional and cognitive functions as well as reverses the abrogated eCB-dependent synaptic plasticity caused by n-3 PUFA deﬁciency in brain regions processing mood and cognition [ 22–24]. Moreover, DHA modulates CB 1mRNA and protein expression [ 25] as well as eCBs [ 26,27].In fact, a new class of n-3-derived eCBs has been identiﬁed in addition to the most-known n-6-derived 2-AG and anandamide (AEA) [28].However, despite the close relationship between EtOH, n-3 and CB 1receptors, the direct impact of n-3 PUFAs on brain CB 1receptor expression after EtOH intake remains unknown.In this investigation, we studied the effects of an n-3-enriched diet on CB 1 receptor expression in the adult brain after binge drinking during adolescence.In particular, we analyzed CB 1receptor optical density in fourteen brain regions that are sensitive to EtOH damage and are known to express CB 1receptors.2.
Results N-3 and Brain CB 1Receptor Expression The brain and cerebellar CB 1immunostaining patterns in H 2O, EtOH, n-3-EtOH and n- 3-H 2O mice corresponded well with previous observations of the CB 1receptor distribution in the mouse brain and cerebellum. CB 1immunoreactive punctate appeared concentratedin certain brain regions as well as in some cerebral and cerebellar cortical layers.Thus, strong CB1receptor immunoreactivity was observed in the granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb (OB) [ 29] and remarkable staining was also revealed in the striatum, cerebral cortex (layers II–III and V–VI), olfactory tubercle, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SN), amygdala (Amg) and hippocampus [ 30], as well as the cerebellar molecular and Purkinje cell layers.More moderate immunoreactivity was detected in the nucleus accumbens (Acb) [31].The analysis of the CB 1receptor optical density showed that the receptor distribution pattern varied in some regions depending on EtOH and/or n-3 intake.
However, no changes were found in the OB, primary motor cortex (M1), frontal cortex (Fr3), cingular cortex area (Cg1), caudate putamen (CPu), dentate gyrus (DG), hippocampal CA1, SN and entorhinal cortex (Ent) in the four conditions ( p> 0.05; Figure 1, Table 1). In contrast, the secondary motor cortex (M2), Cb, cingulum (cg), Amg and Acb were affected by EtOH and n-3 intake ( p< 0.05; Figure 2).Thus, a signiﬁcant reduction in CB 1receptor staining (~20%) was detected in the adult M2 after adolescent EtOH intake relative to the control (EtOH: 82.20±3.732%; H 2O: 100.00±3.507% * p< 0.05; Figures 2 and 3 A; Table 1).Remarkably, n-3 supplementation during withdrawal recovered CB 1receptor expression in the M2 to control Int.J.Mol.Sci.2023 ,24, 17316 3 of 14 levels (n-3-EtOH: 106.30 ±4.604% ** p< 0.01), without the enriched diet having any effect on H2O mice (n-3-H 2O: 100.50±5.218% * p< 0.05; Figures 2 and 3A; Table 1).
The decrease in CB1optical density following EtOH exposure during adolescence was more conspicuous in the Cb (EtOH: 76.40 ±4.445% versus H 2O: 100.00±5.267%, ** p< 0.01), particularly in the molecular layer (Figures 2 and 3B; Table 1). The n-3 diet normalized the detrimental effect of EtOH on CB 1values (n-3-EtOH: 98.43 ±5.627%, *p< 0.05 ;Figures 2 and 3B ; Table 1).Again, n-3 under standard H 2O conditions did not modify receptor expression in this region (n-3-H 2O: 100.40±4.620%, ** p< 0.01; Figures 2 and 3B; Table 1).A similar effect of EtOH was observed in the cg, where CB 1optical density decreased signiﬁcantly in adult mice after binge drinking during adolescence (EtOH: 80.77±4.864% versus H 2O: 100.00±4.868% *p< 0.05; Figures 2 and 3C; Table 1).
However, n-3 was unable to revert signiﬁcantly the receptor deﬁcit (n-3-EtOH: 97.86 ±5.274%), in contrast to the dietary effect on H 2O (n-3-H 2O: 105.20±4.610%) relative to the CB 1decrease in EtOH mice (** p< 0.001; Figures 2 and 3C; Table 1). The values in the Amg were also affected (Figures 2 and 3D; Table 1): the signiﬁcant CB 1reduction in EtOH mice (EtOH: 82.80 ±3.468% versus H 2O: 100.00±3.594%, ** p< 0.01) returned to normal with n-3 intake (n-3-EtOH: 102.30 ±3.977%, **p< 0.01), with no effect of the nutritional supplementation when mice only drank H 2O (97.69±5.744%).Finally, CB 1optical density was drastically reduced in the Acb of the mature brain exposed to EtOH during adolescence (EtOH: 54.18 ±10.81% versus H 2O: 100.00±6.028, *** p< 0.001; Figures 2 and 3E; Table 1).However, n-3 intake could not restore CB 1receptor expression in EtOH mice (n-3-EtOH: 60.61 ±8.153%).
In addition, and contrary to the other studied brain regions, n-3 downregulated CB 1staining in H 2O mice (n-3-H 2O: 66.15±11.04%, * p< 0.05; Figures 2 and 3E; Table 1).

However, long-term changes in CB 1 im- munostaining after adolescent alcohol intake were restricted to some brain regions and the Cb that seem to correlate with the impact of EtOH intake on brain structure and func-tion [6,32,33]. EtOH alters grey ma tter throughout the cortex, including the olfactory ar- eas, Amg and Cb [33–35].Also, the mesocorticolimbic system is a ﬀected.We observed that the long-lasting decrease in CB 1 receptors normally expressed in the Acb [36] did not re- cover over time after adolescent binge drinking, remaining low even when the animals were under n-3 supplementation.As CB 1 receptors intervene in brain maturation, it is plausible that the CB 1 receptor expression de ﬁcits revealed in the Acb negatively contrib- ute to the shape of the mesocorticolimbic syst em during the adolesce nt period, ultimately promoting brain vulnerability and alcohol addiction [35].This study was conducted using male mice.

Long-Lasting Effect of Adolescent Binge Drinking on CB 1Receptor Expression We have shown that binge drinking during adolescence reduces CB 1receptor im- munostaining in certain regions of the mature mouse brain, in particular, the M2, Cb, cg, Amg and Acb. Interestingly, n-3 supplementation during abstinence restores CB 1receptor expression measured using optical density in the M2, Cb and Amg and ameliorates density levels in the cg.The CB 1receptor expression pattern matched the brain receptor distribution in the cortical, limbic and motor regions [ 2,30].However, long-term changes in CB 1immunostain- ing after adolescent alcohol intake were restricted to some brain regions and the Cb that seem to correlate with the impact of EtOH intake on brain structure and function [ 6,32,33].EtOH alters grey matter throughout the cortex, including the olfactory areas, Amg and Cb [ 33–35].Also, the mesocorticolimbic system is affected.
We observed that the long- lasting decrease in CB 1receptors normally expressed in the Acb [ 36] did not recover over time after adolescent binge drinking, remaining low even when the animals were under n-3 supplementation. As CB 1receptors intervene in brain maturation, it is plausible that the CB 1receptor expression deﬁcits revealed in the Acb negatively contribute to the shape of the mesocorticolimbic system during the adolescent period, ultimately promoting brain vulnerability and alcohol addiction [35].This study was conducted using male mice.Though males might be more vulnerable to withdrawal [ 37], females are more sensitive to EtOH [ 38,39].Also, the effectiveness of treatments differs between males and females [ 40].It is plausible that the EtOH impact on CB1receptor expression and the effects of the n-3-enriched diet may vary between males and females, a possibility that will be explored in our future investigations.
The LM immunohistochemistry applied in the present study has some obvious limita- tions that deserve attention. Immunohistochemical techniques for LM were used in the 1990s to describe the pattern of CB 1receptor-like immunoreactivity in the brain [ 41,42].Consequently, the strong immunostaining observed in certain brain regions (motor, lim- bic, reward, cortical) endorsed the advance in the knowledge of CB 1receptor functions in brain circuits.However, low CB 1receptor expression in cell types cannot be visual- ized using LM immunohistochemistry [ 30].In addition, the tendency to diffusion of the 3-3′diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction product used as chromogen in LM immunohisto- chemistry could lead to potential unspeciﬁc staining or false positives due to endogenous biotinylated proteins.These pitfalls can only be ruled out by using appropriate controls.
In this study, we have used CB 1-knockout brain tissue to discard bias, conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of the CB 1staining observed throughout the brain in our experimental condi- tions. Ultimately, high-resolution immunoelectron microscopy that has been shown to be an excellent tool for unveiling the precise subcellular localization of CB 1receptors in the brain, would deﬁnitely identify the subcellular compartments and the CB 1receptor pools that were conspicuously reduced by adolescent EtOH intake, and recovered by n-3 in the speciﬁc brain regions identiﬁed in this study.Endocannabinoid levels, membrane ﬂuidity and EtOH-degrading enzymatic machin- ery could contribute to the altered CB 1receptor pattern observed in the adult brain after adolescent binge drinking.In addition, EtOH intake during adolescence causes memory impairment that can last into adulthood [ 43,44].
Our model of binge drinking during adolescence used in this study has previously been shown to be associated with hip- pocampal memory deﬁcits in adulthood [ 15,45]. Although CB 1receptor optical density was not signiﬁcantly affected by binge drinking, subtle subcellular changes in receptor expression were detected in the dentate molecular layer that should contribute to the abrogation of cannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity at the excitatory medial perforant path synapses and related memory loss [ 15].Remarkably, the deleterious cognitive binge drinking effects were recovered by increasing the endocannabinoid 2-AG or by environ- mental conditions [ 15,45].Furthermore, the M2 and Cb, both affected by EtOH, are brain regions involved in motor coordination [ 46,47] and EtOH intake leads to motor incoor- Int.J.Mol.Sci.2023 ,24, 17316 7 of 14 dination and ataxia [ 43].
Our present results show a signiﬁcant decrease in CB 1staining in the cerebellar molecular layer, where the receptor is mostly localized to the excitatory granule cell parallel ﬁber terminals [ 48]. However, the lack of CB 1receptors does not seem to cause evident cerebellar motor deﬁcits [ 49], despite their role in motor learning [ 50].Nevertheless, cannabinoid-dependent motor control is also exerted from the cortex [ 51], where we detected deﬁcits in CB 1receptors upon adolescent binge drinking.Interestingly, young adult mice under enriched environment recovered motor coordination and balance after adolescent binge drinking [ 45].It is likely that the ECS participates in this motor improvement, as it is the case in the memory recovery elicited by environmental enrichment via the restoration of endocannabinoid-dependent excitatory synaptic plasticity, in which CB1receptors, group I metabotropic glutamate receptors and 2-AG were involved [9].
EtOH modiﬁes synaptic membrane ﬂuidity [ 52] and stimulates arachidonic acid (AA) production from membrane phospholipids by increasing phospholipase A 2(PLA 2) [53]. The availability of more AA for AEA synthesis may be responsible for the decrease in CB1agonist binding and gene expression elicited by chronic EtOH in certain brain re- gions [ 54,55]).In fact, the drop in CB 1receptor immunostaining in the cerebellar molecular layer correlates with AEA transport inhibition and a 2-AG increase in granule cells after chronic EtOH [ 56,57].Cannabinoids internalize CB 1receptors and reduce their mobility, having an impact on receptor availability at the synapse [ 58].We have demonstrated previously that ∆-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) causes a selective CB 1receptor labeling decrease in certain subcellular compartments (excitatory and inhibitory terminals, mito- chondria, astrocytes) of several brain regions [ 59].
This distinct impact of THC could be related to the different THC levels and metabolites detected among brain regions after acute THC administration [ 60]. A similar phenomenon could befall our model of binge drinking.In fact, brain EtOH metabolism by class III alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gener- ates acetaldehyde that accumulates in the hippocampus, cortex and Cb, where the enzyme is more expressed [ 61].Interestingly, the enzyme distribution coincides in brain regions with high CB 1receptor expression, such as the cortex and Cb, both strikingly affected by adolescent binge drinking.EtOH decreases glutathione in these same regions, thus in- creasing oxidative processes and brain damage in a model of prenatal EtOH exposure [ 17].
As class III ADH is a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, it is likely that the glutathione reduction elicited by EtOH and the consequent oxidative state leads to enzyme malfunction, jeopardizing EtOH elimination in regions where the enzyme is more abundant. 3.2.N-3 Recovers CB 1Receptor Expression in the Brain DHA and AA are major phospholipid components of brain cell membranes [ 16,19].EtOH reduces DHA in the brain [ 20,21] and its deﬁcit impacts on both cell membranes, altering their biophysical properties, and related membrane proteins, such as enzymes and receptors [ 19].N-3 deﬁciency lowers CB 1receptors in different brain regions [ 62] and impairs endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic plasticity [ 22].The Fr3, OB, Cb, hippocampus, midbrain and striatum rank in high-to-low order among the brain regions with more DHA [ 63].
However, the negative effect on CB 1receptor expression in the adult brain after adolescent binge drinking was particularly outstanding in the M2, Cb and Acb (ventral striatum), with no effect in the hippocampus, dorsal striatum, some cortical areas, OB and SN. A DHA-enriched diet counteracts the low brain n-3 PUFA levels due to EtOH intake [ 21] and reverses EtOH-induced impairment of synaptic plasticity [ 18].It also restores aquaporin-4, PLA-2 and glutathione affected by EtOH [ 17,21,64,65].The recovery of CB 1receptor immunostaining by n-3 supplementation during the abstinence period points to the normalization of cell membrane homeostasis.In conclusion, abusive EtOH consumption during adolescence alters CB 1receptor immunostaining optical density in some brain regions of the adult mouse, and an n-3- enriched diet recovers the reduced CB 1expression in limbic and motor structures following binge drinking.Uncovering the PUFA effects and mechanisms by which the n-3-enriched Int.J.

Name Mouse Line Derived from Background Breeding Strategy Used CB1-KOCB1-KO (CB 1−/−) Originally obtained by crossing CB1f/fmice with CMV-Cre mice (“Cre deleter”) [66]Predominant C57BL/6-N (9–10 back-crossings)Female CB 1+/− X Male CB 1+/− CB1, Type-1 cannabinoid; CB 1-KO, Cannabinoid type-1 receptor knockout mouse. 4.2.Animal Treatment Four-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (Janvier Labs, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) were housed in pairs and habituated to a dark cycle (8 a.m.–8 p.m.).Then, they were exposed to water or drinking-in-the-dark (DID) during adolescence, as previously described [ 45].Brieﬂy, the mice were individualized and exposed to a bottle of 10 mL tap water or EtOH 20% (Boter S.L., Barcelona, Spain) four days a week during four weeks (postnatal day (PND) 32 to 56).They had free access to the bottle for 2 h the ﬁrst three days, and 4 h the fourth day.Mice were resting and kept in pairs with food and water ad libitum for the last three days of the week (Figure 4A–C).
On PND 56, a blood sample was collected from the lateral tail vein using a capillary tube 30 min after 4 h of EtOH exposure (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Blood samples were analyzed for EtOH concentration using a commercial OH assay kit (Abcam ab65646, Madrid, Spain), following manufacturer instructions.Half of the mice were fed 2% EPA and DHA (2.2% EPA and 1.5% DHA of total fats; SAFE, Augy, France) during withdrawal (PND 56–73).Twice a week, mice and food were weighed to measure EPA and DHA intake (mg/kg/day) (Figure 4D).Three mice/group were culled on PND 73.They were deeply anesthetized using 4% chloral hydrate (10 mL/kg body weight, i.p.) and perfused through the left ventricle with 30 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4), followed by 80 mL of the ﬁxative (4% formaldehyde depolymerized from paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid, 0.1% glutaraldehyde) prepared in PBS at room temperature (RT).Brains were removed and post-ﬁxed as described elsewhere in detail [ 59].4.3.
Antibody Characterization The speciﬁcity of the CB 1receptor antibody (Nittobo Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan); goat polyclonal, CB 1-Go-Af450, RRID AB_2571592, Table 3) has been tested thoroughly [3,4,30] . In addition, CB 1receptor staining was not detected in the CB 1-KO mouse brain (Figure 5).Int.J.Mol.Sci.2023 ,24, 17316 9 of 14 Int.J.Mol.Sci.2022 , 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 15 CB 1, Type-1 cannabinoid; CB 1-KO, Cannabinoid type-1 receptor knockout mouse.4.2.Animal Treatment Four-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (Janvier Labs, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) were housed in pairs and habituated to a dark cycl e (8 a.m.–8 p.m.).Then, they were exposed to water or drinking-in-the-dark (DID) during adolescence, as previously described [45].Brieﬂy, the mice were individualized and exposed to a bo ttle of 10 mL tap water or EtOH 20% (Boter S.L., Barcelona, Spain) four days a week during four weeks (postnatal day (PND) 32 to 56).

Finally, following ﬁve washes with 0.5% Triton in PB, the sections were mounted, dehydrated and coverslipped with DPX (Sigma Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany Cat#44581). 4.5.Semiquantitative Analysis of CB 1Receptor Optical Density Brain and cortical regions known to express CB 1receptors were selected: OB, M1, M2, Fr3, Cg1, cg, CPu, Acb, Amg, DG, hippocampal CA1, SN, Ent and Cb.Micrographs were taken at 10×using a light microscope (Olympus BX61, Hamburg, Germany) and processed using the Olympus cellSens Dimension using consecutive sections containing the brain regions and cortical areas of interest.For each region, three independent optical density measurements were performed at 10 ×, and two more were taken in a blank zone to rank background level.As some regions were through several slides, they were analyzed repeatedly in each mouse of the four experimental conditions (Table 4).All measurements were then pooled by mouse.
Subsequently, data were normalized to 100% of the H 2O group. Image J software (1.8.0_322); NIH; RRID:SCR_003070) and a statistical software package were used (GraphPad Prism 8; RRID: SCR_002798).The Shapiro–Wilk normality test was applied before running one-way ANOVA.Parametric data were analyzed using Holm Sidak’s multiple comparison test and non-parametric data using Dunn’s multiple comparison test.All values are given as mean ±SEM.Table 4.Number of measurements taken in the olfactory bulb (OB), primary and secondary motor cortex (M1, M2), frontal cortex (Fr3), cingular cortex area 1 (Cg1), cingulum (cg), caudate putamen (CPu), nucleus accumbens (Acb), amygdala (Amg), dentate gyrus (DG), CA1 hippocampus, substantia nigra (SN), entorhinal cortex (Ent) and cerebellum (Cb) for each experimental condition (n = 3 mice/group).
