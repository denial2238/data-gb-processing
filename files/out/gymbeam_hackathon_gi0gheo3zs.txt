Medicationhistory is signi ﬁcant for using ashwagandha 600mg twice daily, probiotic-10. Vitals were BP 102/70 mmHg, HR 108 beats/min, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 98%, BMI 31.28kg/ m 2.Laboratory evaluation showed AM cortisol of 21.6 ug/ dL H (6.2-19.4 ug/dL), ACTH 6.2 pg/mL (7.2-63.3 pg/mL),DHEA-s >1000 ug/dL H (84.8-378 ug/dL), TSH 1.39 IU/ mL (0.45-4.5 IU/mL), free t4 2.39 ng/dL H (0.82-1.77 ng/dL), IGF-1 252 ng/mL (91-308 ng/mL), 1mg dexamethasonesuppression test resulted AM cortisol of 1.5 ug/dL (6.2-19.4ug/dL).Subsequently, further work up revealed 17 hydrox-yprogesterone of 158 ng/dL (luteal phase 35-290 ng/dL),total testosterone 176 ng/dL H (13-71 ng/dL), free testoster-one 1.8 pg/mL (0-4.2 pg/mL), androstenedione 113 ng/dL(41-262 ng/dL), LH 2.5 mIU/mL (follicular phase 2.0-12.6mIU/mL), FSH, 3.6 mIU/mL (follicular phase3.5-12.5mIU/mL).
Patient underwent CT abdomen and pelviswith and without contrast which showed normal adrenalglands, prominent right ovary and US Pelvis was recom-mended. Pelvic ultrasound showed normal ovaries.MRIpelvis with and without contrast revealed 1cm right ovar-ian hemorrhagic cyst.Patient was subsequently asked tostop all over the counter supplement medications and aDHEA-s level was checked about 6 weeks and was marked-ly reduced to 435 ug/dL.TSH and free t4 improved to 0.789IU/mL and free t4 1.43 ng/dL respectively.
Conclusion: This case highlights that over the counter, readily availablesupplements that are marketed for reducing stress maycause remarkable alteration of natural physiology.Ashwagandha ’s use in men have been known to cause ele- vations in DHEA-s in men and this case highlights thatAshwagandha ’s use in women can also cause elevation in DHEA-s and how a simple intervention of eliminatingAshwagandha can improve DHEA-s levels Presentation: Saturday, June 17, 2023 1KING SAUD UNIVERSITY, RIYADH, Saudi Arabia;2King Saudi University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia;3KING SAUD UNIVERSITY, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia;4King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia;5Agricultural Research Center, Cairo, EgyptA568 | Journal of the Endocrine Society | https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvad114 J Endocrine Soc, Volume 7, Issue Supplement_1, October –November 2023 A568
