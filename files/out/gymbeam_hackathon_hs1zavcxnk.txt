Copyright ©2022 by the American Thoracic Society Anabolic Resistance: An Uncomfortable Truth for Clinical Trials in Preventing Intensive Care –acquired Weakness and Physical Functional Impairment Acute muscle wasting occurs rapidly in critically ill patients and results in long-lasting physical functional impairment, at substantialphysical, emotional, and economic cost to patients, families, andsociety. After critical illness, patients struggle to regain muscle mass, and rehabilitation strategies have yet to be demonstrated to be successful, emphasizing the need for primary prevention to minimizemuscle loss during the acute phase.Loss of muscle mass is the resultof altered protein homeostasis, which is in turn underpinned byintramuscular in ﬂammation and bioenergetic failure from altered substrate use (1, 2).
Given the scale of the clinical problem, and thelack of therapeutic options, maintaining muscle mass and associatedphysical function is of increasing interest to clinical trialists andfunding bodies (3). One frequently discussed possibility is to increaseprotein intake to prevent the loss of muscle protein, but trials have ingeneral not been successful.Designing appropriate interventional studies requires additional physiological and mechanistic knowledge, such as the ability of skeletal muscle to both receive andrespond to such interventions.The recent study by Chapple andcolleagues (pp.740–749) in this issue of the Journal supplies exactly this (4).Dynamic measurements of physiological processes are challenging to both observe and quantify.Molecular medicineremains an imperfect window, with multiple competing andinteracting intracellular pathways to account for, in addition to theentropic requirements of these processes.
Stable isotope tracermethodology has existed for almost eight decades and has over timebecome increasingly sophisticated as a summative measure ofphysiological processes (5). This technology, which uses stable isotope –labeled metabolites, is the only method available to quantify theﬂux or rate of metabolic and physiological pathways in vivo in humans, without any risk for the subjects because of the use ofnonradioactive isotopes that are already naturally occurring.Challenges with this technology are the relatively high costs for material and analyses and the required expertise in mass spectrometry and kineticmodeling.Chapple and colleagues (4) have used this technology bycombining different stable isotope tracers of amino acid and protein metabolism in an innovative way, quantifying several components of protein metabolism at the same time.
Chapple and colleagues (4) offer a unique physiological observational study ﬁlling two important gaps in knowledge of relevance to current trials of nutritional protein supplementation incritically ill patients. First, is amino acid absorption impaired as measured by gut lumen to central circulation ﬂux?Second, is the dynamic capacity of skeletal muscle to respond to nutritionalamino acids impaired?Stable isotope infusions into two compartments (luminal and central circulation) were performed, and incorporation of amino acids into a third compartment (skeletal muscle) was measured,encompassing the entirety of the nutritional amino acidsupplementation pathway and its potential downstream impact.Three distinct but related observations were made.First, duodenum-administered protein absorption into the central circulation was not impaired in critically ill patients compared with healthy control subjects over 6 hours.
Second, the response of thewhole-body protein balance to an enteral protein feed was similar inpatients and control subjects, despite overall higher whole-body protein turnover (protein breakdown and synthesis) in the patients. Last, although fasting muscle protein synthesis rates did not differ betweengroups, a blunted response in muscle protein synthesis was seen in critically ill patients after intraduodenal protein administration.This resulted in 60% less nutritional protein being incorporated into skeletalmuscle in critically ill patients compared with healthy control subjects, This article is open access and distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No DerivativesLicense 4.0 .For commercial usage and reprints, please e-mail Diane Gern (dgern@thoracic.org).

The convergence of data from different isotopes offers con ﬁdence in the observation of this phenomenon, unwelcome as it might be.The impact of these data on routine clinical practice is likely to be minimal, though one might reasonably hypothesize that ifanabolic resistance occurs in bolus feeding, then it is likely to occur in continuous feeding or even be more marked (6).This challenges current practice guidelines in addition to challenging currentrecommendations of increasing protein delivery to prevent musclewasting, as this is likely to result in diminishing returns.However, a normal effect on whole-body protein balance has been observed in this and other studies, which could have bene ﬁcial effects for patients (7).
The impact of these data on the design of current and future clinical trials is, however, quite signi ﬁcant and potentially disheartening. Three multicenter randomized trials of increased protein delivery are currently ongoing: the EFFORT (Effect of Higher Protein Dosing in Critically Ill Patients) trial, the PRECISe (ProteinProvision in Critical Illness) trial, and TARGET-PROTEIN (Augmented versus Routine Approach to Giving Energy-PROTEIN) trial.These data suggest that the idea that we may maintain musclemass in critically ill patients by stimulating muscle protein synthesiswith nutritional protein should be reconsidered.The scale of anabolic resistance seen suggests that the effect size of the intervention would be quite small (8).Possibly, higher protein doses will overcome thisproblem, but this is not guaranteed, and higher doses may even be harmful.
Anabolic resistance in elderly patients can be overcome by increasing protein intake or by combining it with resistanceexercise (9), but whether this will work in acutely critically ill patients needs to be studied. Age-related anabolic resistance may compound this further, as the average age in Chapple and colleagues ’study was 50 years, a decade or so younger than the average critically ill patient.Worryingly, these data suggest that the synergistic interaction between exercise and nutrition may also be blunted in the acute phase.These data do offer a clear steer in the ﬁeld of intervention development for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in critically ill patients.Undifferentiated hydrolyzed protein formulaeare likely to offer little bene ﬁti nt e r m so fa m i n oa c i da b s o r p t i o n .
In devising strategies, researchers should perhaps consider focusing on underpinning abnormal physiology and metabolism of alteredprotein homeostasis: that of intramuscular in ﬂammation and altered substrate use leading to bioenergetic failure (10). Immunomodulation, substrate switching, and altering peripheralinsulin sensitivity are some of the more promising mechanismsto target, which may then reduce anabolic resistance and allow muscle mass maintenance from nutritional protein delivery and/or exercise.Muscle protein breakdown is the other side of the proteinhomeostasis equation that is signi ﬁcantly affected in critically ill patients (1, 11 –13) and perhaps needs to be examined as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients.This has not been an approach taken intheﬁeld of muscle wasting generally, as muscle protein synthesis is the dominant or facilitative process in humans (14).
Nevertheless, in the face of compelling evidence for anabolic resistance, alteringmuscle protein breakdown may be an alternative therapeutic option. These alternative approaches to maintaining muscle mass are ones that the ﬁeld is less comfortable with, but data remain data regardless of our comfort zones./H17039Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org .Zudin Puthucheary, F.R.C.P.William Harvey Research InstituteQueen Mary University of LondonLondon, United Kingdom andAdult Critical Care Unit Royal London HospitalLondon, United Kingdom Olav Rooyackers, Ph.D.CLINTECKarolinska InstitutetHuddinge, Sweden References 1.Klaude M, Mori M, Tj €ader I, Gustafsson T, Wernerman J, Rooyackers O.Protein metabolism and gene expression in skeletal muscle of critically illpatients with sepsis.Clin Sci (Lond) 2012;122:133 –142.2.Puthucheary ZA, Rawal J, McPhail M, Connolly B, Ratnayake G, Chan P, et al.Acute skeletal muscle wasting in critical illness.
