The mathematical model enabled us to independently alter the activities of each of the 5 vitamin B-6–dependent enzymes and thus determine which inhibitions were responsible for the experimentally observed consequences of a vitamin B-6deﬁciency.
The effect of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency on serine and glycine concentrations in tissues and plasma was almost entirely due to its effects on the activity of glycine decarboxylase. The effect of vitamin B-6 restriction on GSH con- centrations appeared to be indirect, arising from the fact that vitamin B-6 restriction increases oxidative stress, which, in turn, affects several enzymes in 1-carbon metabolism as well as the GSH transporter.Vitamin B-6 restriction causes an abnormally high and prolonged homocysteine response to a methionine load test.This effect appeared to be mediated solely by its effects on cystathionine b-synthase.Reduction of the enzymatic activity of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) had negligible effects on most metabolite concentrations and reaction velocities.Reduction or total elimination of cytoplasmic SHMT had a surprisingly moderate effect on metabolite concentrations and reaction velocities.
This corresponds to the experimental ﬁndings that a reduction in the enzymatic activity of SHMT has little effect on 1-carbonmetabolism. Our simulations showed that the primary function of SHMT was to increase the rate by which the glycine- serine balance was reequilibrated after a perturbation.J.Nutr.139: 784–791, 2009.Introduction The pathways of 1-carbon metabolism and glutathione (GSH)9 synthesis are critical for nucleotide synthesis, DNA and histone methylation, oxidant defense, and the synthesis and degradationof homocysteine (Hcy).Vitamin B-6, in the form of pyridoxal 5#-phosphate (PLP), is the coenzyme of 5 enzymes in these metabolic pathways: cystathionine b-synthase (CBS), cystathi- onine g-lyase (CTGL), cytoplasmic and mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT and mSHMT), and glycine decarboxylase (GDC) in the mitochondria.Vitamin B-6 deﬁciency has been associated with a number of adverse health effects.
There is an inverse relationship between vitamin B-6 status and the incidence of cardiovascular disease and fatal coronary heart disease (1–4) and stroke (5). In animaland human studies, vitamin B-6 status has been shown to have an inverse relationship with the risk for colorectal carcinogenesis (6,7).Because vitamin B-6 is a coenzyme for SHMT, it plays arole in generating 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH 2-THF), which is necessary for thymidylate synthesis for DNA replica- tion and repair.Insufﬁcient CH 2-THF leads to uracil misincor- poration into DNA and subsequent strand breaks (8).In themitochondria, the synthesis of CH 2-THF also depends on the GDC reaction of the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system (9), and CH 2-THF is used to generate formate, which is exported to1Supported by a grant from the Howard Hughes Foundation and by the NIH grants R01 CA 105437 (C.M.U.) and R01 DK 072398 (J.F.G.), and by the National Science Foundation grant DMS-061670 (M.C.R.).

Initial review completed January 12, 2009.Revision accepted January 30, 2009.First published online February 25, 2009; doi:10.3945/jn.109.104265.cytoplasmic 1-carbon metabolism for purine and pyrimidine synthesis and the remethylation of Hcy.Finally, because CBS and CTGL are the ﬁrst 2 steps in the synthesis of GSH via the transsulfuration pathway ( Supplemental Fig.1 ), it is not unreasonable to suspect that vitamin B-6 status will affect the response to oxidative stress and the maintenance of the redox status of the cell (10–14).Vitamin B-6 deﬁciency also alters the proﬁle of several key metabolites.Some of these changes are easy to explain while others are quite puzzling.Several studies have shown thatvitamin B-6 deﬁciency causes liver and/or plasma glycine concentrations to rise (14–18) and in all but one of these studies serine concentrations also rose.
Cellular oxidative stress isincreased in the presence of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency (10,11) and Bvitamin supplementation mitigates the effects of oxidative stress after stroke (19). A vitamin B-6 deﬁciency is also associated with an elevation of cellular and plasma GSH (20,21).This effectseems paradoxical, because 2 steps of the transsulfuration pathway (CBS and CTGL) could be compromised in vitamin B-6 deﬁciency, so one might expect that GSH synthesis would bereduced.Ubbink et al.(22) have shown that patients with vitamin B-6 deﬁciency have abnormal methionine loading tests in which Hcy stays elevated longer.Finally, Cuskelly et al.(23)and Davis et al.(18) have shown, perhaps surprisingly, that amild vitamin B-6 deﬁciency does not alter total Hcy remethy- lation to methionine, the fraction of Hcy remethylation, or the fraction of remethylation that involves the SHMT-dependentacquisition of 1-carbon units from serine in humans.
In this article, we used a previously developed mathematical model of 1-carbon and GSH metabolism (24) to investigate theseexperimental and clinical ﬁndings. Our goal was to explain the mechanisms by which vitamin B-6 deﬁciency leads to the observed results, especially in cases where the experimental orclinical results are nonintuitive or (seemingly) contradictory.The mathematical model is an excellent platform for such explan- atory investigations, because we can vary 1 thing at a time andexamine the consequences.For example, in a real vitamin B-6deﬁciency, the activities of all 5 enzymes discussed above decrease, albeit to different degrees.In the model, we can decrease the activities one by one, or in any combination, and toany degree, and thus we can discern which activity changes cause the observed changes in 1-carbon and GSH metabolism.As noted above, vitamin B-6 deﬁciency has been associated withincreased oxidative stress.
But are the changes in metabolism a result of the decreases in enzyme activity, or the increase in oxidative stress, or both? In the model, we can experiment witheach of these possibilities separately and that allows us to get at the root causes of the changes in metabolism in vitamin B-6 deﬁciency.Methods The mathematical model that we used for 1-carbon and GSH metab- olism is described in complete detail in (24) and its online supplementary materials.Here, we describe the modiﬁcations of (24) carried out for thein silico experiments in this article.The mathematical model is in essencea description of the structure and function of the system, as revealed by the literature.In the present article, we use the model to replicate experiments that were not used in its development.We note that amathematical model is in essence a hypothesis that takes the whole system into account and is completely explicit about what is included and what is not (something few experiments can do).
Folate-mediated1-carbon metabolism is an exceedingly complex and nonlinear system,which makes it difﬁcult to take all effects into account by doing thought experiments, particularly because (due to the nonlinearities) many effectsare context dependent. Here, we use the model to show that speciﬁc effects of a vitamin B-6 deﬁciency are due to speciﬁc enzymes and not thecumulative systemic effects of the vitamin deﬁciency.This insight would have been exceedingly difﬁcult to obtain without a mathematical model and illustrates the usefulness of mathematical modeling as an adjunct tolaboratory experimentation.In general, we model a vitamin B-6 deﬁciency by reducing the V max of the 5 enzymes, CBS, CTGL, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic SHMT,and the mitochondrial GDC.In clinical trials of moderate vitaminB-6 deﬁciency [see, e.g.(20)], the human subjects showed plasma PLPlevels 45–67% lower than normal.In experiments with rats [see, e.g.
(15,17,21)], a much broader range of deﬁciencies was studied. To simulate a vitamin B-6 deﬁciency, we decreased the V maxvalues of the 5 PLP-dependent enzymes to various degrees.Although PLP-binding afﬁnity constants for SHMT (25), CBS (26), and CTGL (27) are known, experimental observations relating measured activity of theseenzymes with liver total PLP concentration indicate that sensitivity toloss of activity in vitamin B-6 deﬁciency is not readily predicted by the binding constants.It is known that the activity of CBS is only mildly diminished by a vitamin B-6 deﬁcien cy (21) and that the activities of the other 4 enzymes are linearly reduced by vitamin B-6 deﬁciency(17,21).Therefore, to simulate a general vitamin B-6 deﬁciency, we reduced the V maxof CBS by 20% and the Vmaxvalues of cSHMT, mSHMT, GDC, and CTGL by 60%.
When we simulate a range ofvitamin B-6 deﬁciencies, we always reduce the V maxo fC B Sb yo n e - third of the amount by which the Vmaxvalues of the other enzymes are reduced. Vitamin B-6 deﬁciency may increase oxidative stress in the cell (10,11) and oxidative stress affects many of the enzymes of 1-carbon metabolism (24).In our model, oxidative stress is represented by the concentration of H 2O2, which inhibits methionine synthase (MS) and betaine-Hcy methyltransferase and activates CBS and glutamylcysteineligase (13,28).The concentration of H 2O2also affects the balance between GSH and GSH disulﬁde (GSSG) through the GSH peroxidase and GSH reductase reactions (Supplemental Fig.1).H 2O2alters methionine adenosyl transferase I and methionine adenosyl transferaseIII activity indirectly, because these enzymes are inhibited by GSSG (29,30).
In many cases, the detailed kinetics of the inhibitions and activations are not known, so we include the effect by multiplying thevelocity of the reaction by a factor ki1½H2O2/C138ss ki1½H2O2/C138; (1) where [I] ssis the normal steady-state concentration of the inhibitor and [I] is the current concentration. Because the inhibitor concentration is in the denominator, the reaction velocity decreases as the concentration of the inhibitor increases.We chose this format so that the velocity of thereaction at steady state would remain the same once we added theinhibition.This allows us to easily compare the system with and without inhibition.So, e.g.the velocity of the MS reaction is: V MS¼ðVmax½5mTHF /C138½Hcy /C138 ðKHcy m1½Hcy /C138ÞðK5mTHF m1½5mTHF /C138ÞÞðki1½H2O2/C138ss ki1½H2O2/C138Þ; where 5mTHF is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and the Kms are the appro- priate Michaelis constants for the substrates.
For enzyme activation by H2O2, we used a similar approach and multiplied the reaction velocity by the factor ki1½H2O2/C138 ki1½H2O2/C138ss: (2) We chose the constants k ifor each activation or inhibition by using experimentally derived values when available. When not available, wechose the k ivalue to be the steady-state value of the inhibitor or activator.For details, see the supplemental material to (24).To perform in silico experiments to test the effects of different cSHMT abundance levels, we added the concentration of cSHMT to the model as a variable.cSHMT reacts with 5mTHF to form a complex: cSHMT 15mTHF%k1 k2cSHMT /C15mTHF : A model for vitamin B-6 deﬁciency 785 We took the total ‘‘normal’’ cSHMT concentration to be 9 mmol/L corresponding to the measurements in (31,32).
To simulate the fact thatpart of the 5mTHF is bound to SHMT and thus not available for reactions, we introduced an additional 4.50 mmol/L of folate to the cytoplasm and chose the rate constants k 1andk2so that, at the normal steady, exactly 4.50 mmol/L of 5mTHF was bound to cSHMT, leaving 4.50 mmol/L of 5mTHF free to participate in the reactions, as before. This simple choice insured that the steady-state concentrations and velocities for the extended model were the same as for the base modelto allow for meaningful comparisons as we varied total cSHMT.We adjusted the V maxvalues of cSHMT to be proportional to the concentration of free cSHMT.Results and Discussion Biomarkers for vitamin B-6 deﬁciency.Several enzymes in 1-carbon metabolism use vitamin B-6 as a cofactor and it is thus reasonable to expect that the substrates or products of some of these enzymes could serve as biomarkers for a vitamin B-6deﬁciency.
We examined the responses of various metabolites to different levels of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency and found that the concentration of cystathionine was by far the most sensitivebiomarker for a vitamin B-6 deﬁciency ( Fig. 1 A).This corre- sponds to the ﬁndings of Leklem et al.and Park et al.(33,34), who showed large increases in urinary cystathionine, and Daviset al.and Ubbink et al.(20,22), who found large increases in plasma cystathionine in vitamin B-6–deﬁcient individuals.Vitamin B-6 deﬁciency affects glycine and serine metab- olism.A number of studies have shown that vitamin B-6 deﬁciency causes liver and/or plasma glycine concentrations torise (14–18) and in all but 1 of these studies serine concentra- tions also rose.
When we conducted a simulation in which we inhibited all of the vitamin B-6–dependent enzymes, CBS,CTGL, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial SHMT, and mitochon-drial GDC, we found that that cytoplasmic glycine concentra- tion increased 28% above normal and that the cytoplasmic serine concentration increased ;3% (Fig. 1 B).By comparison, Davis et al.(18) found a 29% glycine increase and a 10% serine increase in human plasma during marginal deﬁciency.Scheer et al.(17) found an inverse relationship between vitamin B-6status and cytoplasmic glycine and serine concentrations.They observed an ;35% glycine increase and a 17% serine increase in the cytoplasm.Runyan and Gershoff (15) found a 28% increasein glycine in the liver tissue of vitamin B-6–deﬁcient rats.Parket al.(16) found that a vitamin B-6 deﬁciency caused an increase in plasma glycine of ;29% and serine of ;47%.Our ﬁndings were consistent with all of these experimental results.One studyby Swenseid et al.
(14) found results inconsistent with both our result and the above experimental results; they found a 100% increase in glycine and a substantial decrease in the serineconcentration (30–40%) in both the liver and plasma of severely vitamin B-6–deﬁcient rats. However, these rats had severe growth deﬁciencies and substantial abnormalities in otherplasma and liver metabolites.We were interested in determining the immediate cause of these changes in glycine and serine metabolism in the presence ofvitamin B-6 deﬁciency.Thus, we experimented with the modelto see the effects of inhibiting each of the enzymes, CBS, CTGL, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial SHMT, and mitochondrial GDC, individually and in combination.We found that theincreases in serine and glycine were almost entirely the result of the inhibition of GDC in the mitochondria ( Table 1 ).Inhibition of GDC produced almost the same effect as inhibiting all5 enzymes.
Inhibition of cytoplasmic SHMT (or CBS, CTGL, mitochondrial SHMT) resulted in almost no change in serine and glycine levels. Similarly, oxidative stress produced verysmall changes in glycine and serine concentrations.Thus, the effect of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency on serine and glycine levels was almost entirely due to its effect on the activity of GDC.This makes sense, because the GDC reaction is a major catabolic pathway for glycine.One carbon is released as CO 2 and the other is accepted by tetrahydrofolate to form methyl-enetetrahydrofolate.Both experimental evidence (9,15) and insilico experiments (35) show that the ﬂux through the GDC reaction is quite high.
When GDC was inhibited, the model showed that glycine built up and some of it was converted toexcess serine by the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic SHMT FIGURE 1 Metabolite ( A) and intercellular glycine and serine ( B) concentrations and as functions of various degrees of vitamin B-6deficiency simulated by decreasing the V maxvalues of the vitamin B-6– dependent enzymes.

It is possible that the slight elevation of intracellular serine indicated by themodel is routed to gluconeogenesis within the liver (Supplemen- tal Fig. 1) and is thus not reﬂected in the level of plasma serine.Interestingly, Lamers et al.(9) found that the GDC ﬂux declined only slightly in the presence of a modest vitamin B-6 deﬁciency.This is exactly what was seen in the model where the GDC ﬂux declined by only 20% when the V maxof GDC was lowered to 40% of normal.The reason for the small effect of a vitamin B-6 deﬁciency on GDC ﬂux was that the glycine concentration in the mitochondria more than doubled (simula-tion not shown) and this increased substrate concentrationmaintained the GDC ﬂux near normal levels.Such a compen- satory effect is possible, because the K mfor glycine in the GDC reaction is high (37) relative to the range of intracellular glycineconcentrations.Vitamin B-6 deﬁciency alters cellular and plasma GSH levels.
Dietary vitamin B-6 restriction caused an elevation in plasma GSH in humans (20) and has been shown to produce an elevation of hepatic GSH in rats (21). This seems like aparadoxical result, because PLP is a coenzyme for 2 enzymesin the transsulfuration and GSH synthesis pathways, and a diminution in the activity of those enzymes would naturally be expected to result in a decline in the GSH synthesis rate, becausecysteine would become limiting.When we simulated a vitamin B-6 deﬁciency by reducing the V maxof CBS to 80% of normal and the other PLP-regulated enzymes to 40%, we found that thecystathionine concentration more than tripled, which agrees with the ﬁndings of Lima et al.(21).However, under our simulated vitamin B-6 deﬁciency, the cellular GSH level decreased slightly, which conﬁrms one’s intuition but disagrees with the experimental ﬁndings that both blood and cellular GSH increase (20,21).
As noted above, avitamin B-6 deﬁciency is also associated with increased oxidativestress and diminished antioxidant status (10,11,19). This is of interest, because oxidative stress alters the activity of several enzymes in 1-carbon metabolism, in addition to the ones directlydependent on PLP (24).Masuda et al.(38) have shown that oxidative stress causes K 1efﬂux from the mitochondria and that the increased K1gradient between the cytoplasm and the blood promotes GSSG transport by both the high- and low-afﬁnity GSSG transporters.To simulate this effect of oxidative stress on GSSG transport, we multiplied the Vmaxof both the high-afﬁnity and low-afﬁnity GSSG transporters by a factor of the form (2) (see ‘‘Methods’’).In the laboratory, it is difﬁcult if not impossible to separate the indirect effects of oxidative stress from the directeffects of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency, but this can be done readily bycomputer simulation with a mathematical model.
We increased oxidative stress in the model by elevating the background concentration of H 2O2, as described in (24) and studied the effects of different degrees of oxidative stress in the presence and absence of a vitamin B-6 deﬁciency. Under vitamin B-6 deﬁciency with a relatively low oxidative stress, both cytoplasmic and blood total GSH increased ( Fig.2 ).Under increasingly higher oxidative stress, cytoplasmic GSH declined, whereas blood GSH continued to increase.Interest-ingly, this effect of oxidative stress on GSH concentrations waslargely independent of the direct effect of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency; when the vitamin B-6 deﬁciency was removed (i.e.all PLP- dependent enzymes fully functional), the response of GSH wasnearly identical.These results indicated that the effect of vitaminB-6 restriction on GSH concentrations was due almost entirely to the effect of vitamin B-6 restriction on oxidative stress.Vitamin B-6 effect on methionine loading tests.
The methionine load test is used to evaluate the capacity of the transsulfuration pathway to maintain homeostasis in the methi- onine cycle and to keep Hcy levels low. Vitamin B-6 deﬁciency haslittle effect on the steady-state concentration of Hcy, but under a vitamin B-6 deﬁciency, Hcy increased to a higher level after a methionine load and elevated Hcy levels persist for a longer time(22,39).We simulated a methionine load test by elevating me- thionine input 10 times for 4 h.Vitamin B-6 deﬁciency was sim- ulated by reducing the V maxof CBS to 80% of normal and that of the other PLP-dependent enzymes to 40%.In this simulation,Hcy rose ;35% higher, and declined more slowly, under vitamin B-6 deﬁciency ( Fig.3 A).To study whether the effect on Hcy proﬁles was due to a particular PLP-dependent enzyme, we al-tered the V maxof each of the enzymes independently.These studies showed that the effect was almost entirely due to the reduction in the activity of CBS (Fig.3 A).The role of SHMT.
Both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial SHMT are PLP-dependent enzymes that are sensitive to thelevel of vitamin B-6 intake (17). A vitamin B-6 deﬁciency can beexpected to interfere with the metabolic functions that depend critically on SHMT, which catalyzes the interconversion of glycine and serine and of THF and CH 2-THF in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondria.CH 2-THF is the 1-carbon donor for thymidylate synthesis and is also is the substrate for the synthesis of 5mTHF, the primary methyl group donor for themethionine cycle that controls DNA and histone methylation, Hcy synthesis, and GSH synthesis.Because SHMT activity affects CH 2-THF synthesis (albeit to a much lesser extent than GDC), and because SHMT binds and sequesters 5mTHF, it has been suggested that SHMT mediates competition between folate-dependent deoxyribonucleotide synthesis and S-adeno- sylmethionine (SAM) biosynthesis (31,40).
Defects in SHMTactivity and changes in SHMT expression thus might be FIGURE 2 Effect of different degrees of oxidative stress (ex- pressed as H 2O2inmmol/L) on cytoplasmic and blood total GSH concentrations, expressed as percent change from ‘‘normal’’ [here and elsewhere in this article, ‘‘normal’’ refers to the steady-state metabolite concentrations and reaction velocities generated by themathematical model described in (24)]. A model for vitamin B-6 deﬁciency 787 expected to have profound effects on the balance of metabolites and reaction velocities in 1-carbon metabolism, with concom- itant effects on thymidylate and purine synthesis, methylation capacity, Hcy levels, and GSH synthesis.However, mice lackingcSHMT have been shown to be viable and fertile but have elevated hepatic levels of SAM (40).Other studies have shown a similar inverse relationship between SHMTexpression and SAMlevels (31).There are 2 ways of changing the catalytic activity of SHMT.
A vitamin B-6 deﬁciency will alter the enzymatic activity of SHMT because of the lack of the PLP coenzyme but does notalter the amount of SHMT and should thus have no effect on the ability of SHMT to sequester 5-mTHF. By contrast, changes in the expression of SHMT will alter both its enzymatic activityand the capacity to bind and sequester folates.In our model, we can alter the enzymatic activity of SHMT via modiﬁcation of theV maxand we can independently alter the concentration of SHMT in the cytoplasm [normal concentration is set at 9 mmol/L(31,32,41)] and thus the binding capacity for 5mTHF.It should be noted that vitamin B-6 deﬁciency in rats has been found to lower both the holoenzyme abundance and the total enzyme abundance of both cSHMT and mSHMT (17).We conducted simulations in which we reduced the Vmax values of either cSHMT, mSHMT, or both ( Table 2 ).
It is striking how little effect the Vmaxof either of these enzymes had on key metabolite concentrations and reaction velocities. Even the cytoplasmic concentrations of glycine and serine showed little dependence on the ‘‘activity’’ of SHMT despite the fact thatSHMT interconverts these 2 amino acids.Even when the V max values of cSHMT and mSHMT were set to zero, metabolites and reaction velocities changed very little.These results indicate thatvitamin B-6 deﬁciency is unlikely to have its metabolic effect viadisruption of SHMT activity.This is consistent with the ﬁnding that cSHMT knockout in mice has few if any deleterious effects (40).Although SHMT activity did not affect the balance between glycine and serine, it did affect how rapidly that balance was achieved.This is illustrated (Fig.3 B) by a simulation in which the system started at equilibrium and then received a large 5-h pulse of glycine.
Under normal conditions, it took ;5–7 h after the pulse for the glycine concentration to come back to thenormal steady state. When the V maxvalues of SHMT were set to 0.1 of normal, it required an additional 5 h for glycine to return to normal; when the Vmaxvalues of SHMT were set to 0.01 of normal, it required an additional 20 h for glycine to return tonormal.Thus, it appears that a major function of SHMT may be to quickly rebalance the relative concentrations of serine and glycine after perturbations, for instance, after a protein meal.Several experimental studies have shown that SHMT deple- tion induces glycine auxotrophy (42–44).The mathematical model also exhibited this effect.The normal balance betweenglycine and serine in the absence of SHMT discussed above only occurred if there was input of glycine into the system.When we set the rate of glycine input to zero, in the absence of SHMT, wefound a severe reduction in many metabolites and reaction ratesin the system ( Table 3 ).
In particular, the rate of the GDC reaction was reduced to nearly zero, the rate of the thymidylate synthase reaction was reduced to 59% of its normal level, and the rate ofexport of 1-carbon units from the mitochondria was reduced to 29% of normal. Interestingly, reducing the serine input to zero had little effect (Table 3), which suggests that glycine input cancompletely make up for the lack of serine, but not vice versa.The reduced rate of thymidylate synthesis, in the absence of SHMT and reduced glycine input, would be expected to result in anincreased misincorporation of uracil into DNA (45).Stover et al.(31,40,46) have studied the effects of over- expression of cSHMT and knockdown of cSHMT on variousmetabolites and reactions of 1-carbon metabolism.They empha-sized the consequences and regulatory effects of tight inhibitory binding of 5mTHF to cSHMT.
To investigate these experimental results and their interpretation, we added the tight binding of5mTHF to cSHMT to the model (see ‘‘Methods’’). As expected, when the concentration of cSHMT was increased, the concen- tration of free 5mTHF decreased and that of bound 5mTHFincreased ( Table 4 ).The total folate concentration in the cell was, of course, unaltered by the level of expression of SHMT.Herbig et al.(31) found that the SAM concentration was in-versely related to the level of cSHMT expression.The reason forthis effect was that as cSHMT expression increased, it seques- tered more 5mTHF (31), so the concentration of all free folates, including 5mTHF, decreased, which decreased the remethyla-tion of Hcy to methionine, which reduced the level of SAM.FIGURE 3 (A) Effect of methionine loading on the Hcy concentra- tion profile under normal conditions and when the Vmaxof all PLP- dependent enzymes was reduced to 50% to simulate a vitamin B-6 deficiency.
( B) Effect of variation of the Vmaxof cSHMT on the time required for recovery from a glycine input pulse. Extracellular glycinewas elevated for 5 h starting at 5 h and then returned to normal.At lower V max, the intracellular glycine concentration rose higher and took longer to return to steady state, but the steady-state level was notaltered.788 Nijhout et al.Herbig et al.(31) also asserted that the expression level of cSHMT mediates the competition between deoxyribonucleotide synthesis and SAM biosynthesis.The idea is that as cSHMTexpression increases, more 5mTHF will be bound so the MS reaction, which remethylates Hcy, will run slower.Thus, more CH 2-THF will be used for thymidylate synthesis via the thymidylate synthase (TS) reaction and less for remethylating Hcy via the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and MS reactions (Supplemental Fig.1).For several reasons, webelieve that this hypothesis is unlikely.
As cSHMT expressionincreased, all the free folate concentrations decreased, because the folates quickly rebalanced (32,45,47) (Table 4) where both free 5mTHF and CH 2-THF decreased. Thus, increased cSHMT expression should lower both the TS rate and the MTHFR rate.Also, the concentration of cSHMT is quite high (9 mmol/L), so large amounts of metabolic work and time are required toincrease its concentration by 50%.In addition, there is no evidence that cSHMT is upregulated during the cell cycle.On the other hand, there is evidence that TS and dihydrofolate reduc-tase are upregulated by as much as a factor of 100 during the cell cycle (48).There is experimental evidence that is consistent with the assertion in (31) and inconsistent with the model result that bothfree 5mTHF and CH 2-THF decrease when cSHMT expression is increased.Oppenheim et al.(46) showed that heavy chain ferritin enhanced cSHMT expression and de novo thymidinebiosynthesis.
The rate of the TS reaction was not measured directly but estimated from the decrease in the rate of radio-labelincorporation into DNA via a competing pathway when ferritin was added. A possible explanation for this inconsistency is that 10-formyltetrahydrofolate is known to be a competitive inhib-itor of TS (49), so when SHMTexpression was increased and 10- formyltetrahydrofolate concentration decreased, this inhibition would be relieved, compensating for the decrease in CH 2-THF.Nevertheless, on balance, it seems much more likely that the expression of TS, rather than the expression of cSHMT, regulates the balance between the TS pathway and the MTHFRpathway.What then is the physiological role of the binding of cSHMT to 5mTHF?It is known that many folate enzymes bind allo- sterically to folate substrates and, therefore, that the concentra-tions of free folates are relatively low (50–53).
We showed previously (45) that this binding is a homeostatic mechanism that stabilizes the velocities of reactions in the folate cycle againstlarge variations in total cellular folate. Because cSHMT has such a high concentration, it plays a major role in the creation of this homeostatic effect.Experimentation with a mathematical model for 1-carbon metabolism and GSH synthesis enabled us to simulate the various effects of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency on the metabolites in this complex metabolic network.Because PLP is a cofactor forsome 150 different enzymes, it was not clear whether the effects of a vitamin B-6 deﬁciency on the metabolites in 1-carbon metabolism and GSH synthesis could be ascribed exclusively byits effects on the 5 PLP-dependent enzymes within this metabolic network.Nor was it clear whether a particular effect of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency was due to the inhibition of all 5 enzymes or onlya subset of them.
The effect of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency on serine and glycine levels was almost entirely due to its effects on the activity ofGDC. The effect of vitamin B-6 restriction on GSH concentra-tions was indirect and arose from the fact that vitamin B-6 restriction increases oxidative stress, which, in turn, affects several enzymes in 1-carbon metabolism as well as the GSHtransporter.Finally, the effect of vitamin B-6 restriction on an abnormal abnormally high and prolonged Hcy response to a methionine load test appeared to be mediated solely by its effectson CBS.Reduction of the enzymatic activity of SHMT had negligible effects on the metabolite concentration and reaction velocities.Reduction or total elimination of cytoplasmic SHMT had a sur-prisingly moderate effect on metabolite concentrations and re- action velocities.
This corresponded to the experimental ﬁndings that a reduction in the enzymatic activity of SHMT (correspond-ing to a vitamin B-6 deﬁciency) has little effect on 1-carbon metabolism. Our simulations showed that the primary functions TABLE 3 Glycine auxotrophy in the absence of SHMT Steady-state velocities SHMT Amino acids Thymidylate GDCFormate export synthase from mitochondria % of Normal Present Normal 100 100 100Absent Normal 96 98 99 Absent No serine 115 108 98 Absent No glycine 59 1 29TABLE 4 Effect of cSHMT concentration on various steady- state reaction velocities and metaboliteconcentrations Relative SHMT concentrationReaction velocities Concentrations TS MTHFR f5mTHF1b5mTHF2CH2-THF SAM GSH % Change from normal 4 270239 245 284 271247 0 2 230212 214 84 231219 0 1 (normal) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.5 13 4 5 249 14 8 0 0 17 5 7 – 18 11 0 1f5mTHF is the concentration of free 5mTHF.

The current structure of the model does not providea mechanism for this. It is possible that nuclear translocation of TS and cSHMT during DNA synthesis allows for the preferential allocation of methyl groups for thymidylate synthesis byproviding a compartment that is free of MTHFR, so that there is no pathway by which methyl groups could be shunted to the methionine cycle.Such nuclear localization would thus prefer-entially enhance the TS reaction.Future development of themodel will include a nuclear compartment and dynamic local- ization of enzymes between cytoplasm and nucleus, which will allow us to study the role of the nuclear compartment intargeting methyl groups between deoxyribonucleotide synthesis and SAM synthesis (31).Literature Cited 1.Rimm EB, Willett WC, Hu FB, Sampson L, Colditz GA, Manson JE, Hennekens C, Stampfer MJ.Folate and vitamin B-6 from diet and supplements in relation to risk of coronary heart disease among women.JAMA.1998;279:359–64.2.
