96 J.Anim.Sci Vol.98, Suppl.S4362 Utilizing Chicken Breast with Wooden Breast and White Striping in Processed Meat Products.Alexander M.Stelzleni1, 1University of Georgia Wooden breast (WB) and white striping (WS) are two myopathies impacting the broiler market.Wooden breast and WS may occur individually or in concert with each other.Wooden breast is characterized by in - creased rigidity and firmness in the pectoralis major and has been associated with breast meat from larger, faster growing broilers.It begins in the ventral-cranial region and increases in severity, moving toward the deeper and more caudal portions of the muscle.Although the etiology is not fully understood, compositional characteristics of WB include increased collagen and lipid deposition and decreased water holding capacity.Breast fillets exhibiting WS are characterized by the size and amount of striping that occurs on the surface of the pectoralis major.
These breasts express similar compositional characteristics to those with WB. Both WB and WS have been associated with decreased or - ganoleptic and rheological properties, causing industry losses estimated in excess of $200 million annually through value downgrades, trim loss, and diversion to rendering.Although WB and WS meat have decreased rheological properties, some lost value may be recap - tured through further processing.Recent studies have shown that both blade tenderization and marination improved the textural properties of afflicted breast meat, but neither were able to overcome the differences between afflicted and normal breast meat.Research investigating comminuted and emulsified products con - taining WB or WS meat have shown similar results due to the lower extraction of salt-soluble proteins and sub - sequent low bind and gelation properties.
When WB/ WS meat was included as a portion of the meat block with normal breast meat, textural and rheological dif - ferences were ameliorated. Using WB or WS meat in further processed products may give processors an al - ternative use for afflicted breast meat.Additional re - search should continue to explore how WB and WS meat can be incorporated into further processed and value-added products.Keywords: Poultry, Myopathies, Processing366 The Ham Halo condition: Characterization and a possible approach for mitigation.Andy King1, Steven Shackelford2, Dan Nonneman3, Gary Rohrer3, Tommy L.Wheeler4, 1USDA- ARS-US Meat Animal Research Center, 2USDA-ARS_ US Meat Animal Research Center, 3US Meat Animal Research Center, 4USDA, ARS, U.S.Meat Animal Research Center The Halo condition is a meat quality defect character - ized by very pale lean tissue on the superficial portion of fresh ham muscles.
This tissue does not allow proper cured color development and has been the subject of customer complaints for ham processors. Surveys of raw materials revealed an issue affecting many suppliers and genetic lines.Further investigation indicated that the condition was most prominent in the distal portion of the biceps femoris muscle and was present in pigs of all ages and stages of production.Halo-affected tissue had much higher proportion of white muscle fibers.Consequently, Halo-affected tissue exhibited much lower myoglobin concentration, as well as much greater lightness, and much lower redness values, compared to normal tissue in the deeper portion of the muscle.These differences are consistent with increased expression of genes coding for white muscle fiber specific proteins in the Halo-affected tissue relative to tissue from the Inside portion of the biceps femoris muscle.
Virtually all muscles evaluated have exhibited some degree of the Halo condition, but significant variation exists in the size of the affected portion of the muscle as well as the severity of the condition. Sire has a substantial impact on variation in Halo condition severity.Thus, genetic selection should help mitigate the condition.We will provide an overview of efforts to characterize the Halo condition and discuss genetic selection as a means to mitigate the condition.Keywords: Pork, Halo, Color
