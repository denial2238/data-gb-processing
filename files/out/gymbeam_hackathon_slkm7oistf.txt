Based on Warburg’s theory that most cancer cells mainly depend on glycolysis for ATP generation, we hypothesize that, LC treatment would lead to disturbance of cellular metabolism and cytotoxicity incancer cells. In this study, Human hepatoma HepG2, SMMC-7721 cell lines, primary cultured thymocytes and mice bearingHepG2 tumor were used.ATP content was detected by HPLC assay.Cell cycle, cell death and cell viability were assayed by flow cytometry and MTS respectively.Gene, mRNA expression and protein level were detected by gene microarray, Real- time PCR and Western blot respectively.HDAC activities and histone acetylation were detected both in test tube and incultured cells.A molecular docking study was carried out with CDOCKER protocol of Discovery Studio 2.0 to predict the molecular interaction between L-carnitine and HDAC.
Here we found that (1) LC treatment selectively inhibited cancer cell growth in vivo and in vitro ; (2) LC treatment selectively induces the expression of p21 cip1gene, mRNA and protein in cancer cells but not p27kip1; (4) LC increases histone acetylation and induces accumulation of acetylated histones both in normal thymocytes and cancer cells; (5) LC directly inhibits HDAC I/II activities viabinding to the active sites of HDAC and induces histone acetylation and lysine-acetylation accumulation in vitro ; (6) LC treatment induces accumulation of acetylated histones in chromatin associated with the p21cip1gene but not p27kip1detected by ChIP assay. These data support that LC, besides transporting acyl group, works as an endogenous HDAC inhibitor in the cell, which would be of physiological andpathological importance.Citation: Huang H, Liu N, Guo H, Liao S, Li X, et al.(2012) L-Carnitine Is an Endogenous HDAC Inhibitor Selectively Inhibiting Cancer Cell Growth In Vivo and In Vitro .

It has been well known that most cancer cells predominantly generate energy by a high rate of glycolysis followed by lactic acidfermentation in the cytosol, rather than by a comparatively lowrate of glycolysis followed by oxidation of pyruvate in mitochon-dria like most normal cells. This is known as Warburg’s effect incancer cells [4,5].Rapidly growing malignant cells typically haveglycolytic rates that are up to 200 times higher than those of their normal tissues of origin.Even though Warburg effect has beenchallenged and further developed, this theory remains the mostfrequently cited evidence that tumors display dysfunctionalmetabolism [6].Based on this theory that the citric cycle is detrimental in most cancer cells [7,8], we hypothesize that LC would lead todisturbance of cellular metabolism in cancer cells but not innormal cells.In this study, we investigated the effects of LC oncytotoxicity both in cancer and normal cells.
We found that LCselectively inhibited cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo .W e further investigated the mechanism of LC-mediated cytotoxicityand found that physiological concentrations of LC could directlyinhibit HDAC activities.

Male normalBalb/c mice were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 8 mice/group) and were i.p. injected with either vehicle (saline) or LC at 400 mg/kg for consecutive 15 days.Body weight and organweight were detected and summarized.Male Balb/c nude micewere s.c.inoculated in the left armpit with HepG2 cells (1 610 6 cells/mouse).When the tumor size reaches 50–75 mm3, mice were randomly divided into two groups (n = 8 mice/group) andwere i.pinjected with either vehicle (saline) or LC (400 mg/kg, once/day) for 15 days except day 8.Body weight and tumorweight were detected and summarized.To better illustrate theseresults, all the primary data were changed to the relative level (%).Cell culture Human hepatoma HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cell lines, purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,VA), were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS,100 U/mL benzyl penicillin and 100 U/mL of streptomycin,pH 7.4 in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2at 37 uC.
Thymocyte isolation and primary culture was performed asfollows: briefly, the thymus from Balb/c mouse was rolled ona piece of sterile gauze to remove attached fat and connectivetissue and the gland was placed into a 60 mm Petri dish containing5 mL of cold media (HBSS at pH 7.0 containing 5% fetal calfserum at 4 uC) and gently teased the thymus apart with needles and pipeted up and down several times to carefully break up any cellclumps. The mixtures were passed through a 75 mm stainless mesh to remove clumps of tissue, centrifuged the cell suspensions (250 g,10 min, 4 uC) and resuspended the cell pellets with 5 mL RPMI 1640 medium.The total cell numbers were counted with trypanblue in a white blood cell counter.Cell death assay This was performed using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) double staining, followed by flow cytometry as previously described [9].
In brief, cultured HepG2 cells were harvested and washed with cold PBS and resuspended with the binding buffer, followed by Annexin V-FITC incubation for 15 min and PI staining for another 15 min at 4 uC in dark. The stained cells were analyzed with flow cytometry within 30 min.ATP content determination ATP content determination was performed as described pre- viously [10].Briefly, Equal number of cultured cells was collected and the cell pellet was immediately frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent ATP analyses.The lysates were centri- fuged at 12 000 r.p.m.for 10 min at 4 uC.The supernatant was collected for analyzing ATP by using a reversed-phase C18 HPLC (LC-6AD, Shimadzu, Japan) assay after the pH was adjusted 7.4.180 mM of KH 2PO 4(5% methanol) was used as mobile phase (pH 6.25) running at 0.8 ml/min.The assay was linear from 0.05 to 200 mg/mL for ATP with coefficient of determination (R2) .0.999.
Validation coefficients of variation for intra- and inter- day assays were less than 1.5% and 5.1%, respectively. Relative ATP content is calculated according to the peak area versus the ATP stand curve.Cell viability assay The effects of drugs on the cell viability were determined by the MTS assay (CellTiter 96 HAQueous One Solution Cell Pro- liferation assay, Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) as reported previously [9].Briefly, cells were cultured in 96-well plates and treated with indicated agents for 24 or 48 h.Then treated cells were incubated with 20 mL of MTS for additional 3 h.The absorbance was measured at 490 nm with Automatic microplate reader (Sunrise, Tecan).Cell viability was calculatedby the following formula: cell viability (%) = (average absorbance of treated group – average absorbance of blank)/(average absorbance of untreated group- average absorbance of blank)]6100%.
Histone and protein acetylation in vitro and in cultured cells For in vitro protein acetylation, cell lysate from either cancer cells or mouse thymocytes were incubated with various doses of LC and TSA or Buty in a HDAC assay buffer at 37 uC for 1.5 h, then acetylated-H3, -H4, and lysine-acetylated proteins were detected by Western Blot. For protein acetylation in cultured cells, either cancer cell or mouse thymocyte was treated with different concentrations of LC or TSA and Buty for various time points, cells were collected and then protein acetylation was detected by Western Blot.Western Blot Western blot was performed as described previously [11,12].Briefly, an equal amount of total protein extracted from culturedcells was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes.Primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated appropriate sec- ondary antibodies were used to detect the designated proteins.
The bounded secondary antibodies on the PVDF membrane were reacted to the ECL detection reagents and exposed to X-ray films (Kodak, Japan). The x-ray film exposure was scanned and digitalized using a high-resolution scanner.The density of desired bands was quantified with the Quantity One software (BioRad).L-Carnitine Is an Endogenous HDAC Inhibitor PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e49062 Cell cycle analysis Cell cycle analysis was performed as reported previously [12].HepG2 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes overnight in RPMI 1640medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, then treatedwith LC at indicated time points.The cells were collected, washedby PBS, and stained with PI in the presence of RNAase.Data wereanalyzed based on the distribution of cell populations in differentphases of cell cycle.
Computational modeling In order to understand the molecular interaction between L- carnitine and HDAC, a molecular docking study was carried outwith CDOCKER protocol of Discovery Studio 2.0 (AccelrysSoftware Inc). The crystal structure of HDAC (PDB ID: 1ZZ0)was used as the docking protein.First, only the chain A subunitwas maintained after other chain subunits, alternate conforma-tions, the original ligand ACT, Potassium metals and watermolecules were removed.Then, hydrogen atoms and Gasteigercharges were added to the subunit.Finally, only hydrogenpositions were optimized with Dreiding-like forcefield using theClean Geometry menu.Meanwhile, the compound L-carnitineselected as the docking inhibitor was also optimized with Dreiding-like forcefield using the Clean Geometry menu.The proteinHDAC was rigid, while the ligand LC was flexible during thedocking process.The Input Site Sphere was centered on theoriginal ligand ACT with radius 12 A ˚.
Top hits, Random conformations and Orientations to refine parameters were all setto 20. The conformation corresponding to the lowest CDOCKERInteraction Energy was selected as the most probable bindingconformation.At last, the docking complex was further estimatedbinding free energy by the Calculate Binding Energies protocol.All parameters used in calculation were default except forexplained.HDAC activity assay in vitro and in cultured cells HDAC activity in vitro and in cultured cells was detected with The HDAC-GloTMI/II Assay and Screening System (Promega, USA) following the standard protocol.HDAC assay wasperformed in white 96-well plate.For in vitro HDAC activity assay, cell lysate (optimal protein content: 1 mg) was incubated with various agents in a HDAC assay buffer (100 ml) at 37 uC for 60 mins and then 100 ml HDACTMI/II reagent was added, after 30 mins, luminescence was measured.
For HDAC assay incultured cells, cells (10000 cells/well) were treated with LC orpositive control agents for 6 h or 12 h, then cell medium waschanged to serum-free medium plus HDAC buffer (50 ml+50ml). After 15 min incubation, HDACTMI/II reagents (100 ml) were added to the cells, luminescence was measured after 30 mins.Quantitative real-time PCR Total RNAs were extracted from HepG2 cells with TRIzol reagent.Reverse transcription of purified RNA was performedusing superscript III reverse transcription according to themanufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen).Quantification of all genetranscripts was done by quantitative using the TaKaRa SYBRPremix Ex Taq kit with Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-TimePCR system.The values of P21 and P27 were shown against thevalue of GAPDH which was used as a control.

Results LC treatment selectively inhibits cancer cell growth in vivo and in vitro It has been well known that most cancer cells depend on glycolysis for ATP generation. To further confirm that in our cell systems, multiple cancer cell lines were used to test whether oligomycin could inhibit ATP production.The result in repre- sentative cancer cells was shown.It was found that in the presence of L-glucose in the culture medium, oligomycin quickly depleted ATP production while in the presence of D-glucose in the culture medium oligomycin did not affect ATP generation (Fig.1 a).Since L-glucose can not be used to produce ATP production [10], this result implies that cancer cells mainly rely on D-glucose glycolysis for ATP production, consistent to previous reports [4,5].We next investigated whether LC treatment could increase intracellularATP production in cancer cells.
Consistent to our prediction, LC treatment could not further increase ATP production in both hepatic HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cancer cells (Fig. 1 b).However,L-Carnitine Is an Endogenous HDAC Inhibitor PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e49062 in contrast to the effect in cancer cells, oligomycin, when added in mouse thymocytes cultured with D-glucose, time-dependentlyinhibited ATP generation (Fig.1 c) while LC efficiently increased intracellular ATP content at different time points under thiscondition (Fig.1 d).These results confirm that LC is able togenerate ATP in normal mouse thymocytes, but not in hepatic HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cancer cells.Next we compared the effects of LC on normal tissue and cancer growth in vivo .Normal Balb/c mice or Balb/c nude mice inoculated with HepG2 cancer cells were i.p.injected with LC (400 mg/kg) for 15 days except day 8, followed by termination ofthe experiment.This dose schedule is a tolerated dose for Balb/cnude mice.
Organ weight and tumor weight of each mouse treatedby LC or control were compared. It was found that LC treatmentinhibited more than 70% of cancer growth, while the same treatment decreased less than 20% of the normal organ de- velopment and body weight (Fig.2 a).We then investigated the effects of LC on cell proliferation by MTS assay.It was found that LC dose-dependently decreasedHepG2 cell viability (Fig.2 b), associated with the cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase (Fig.2 c) and low levels of cell death (Fig.2, dand e).These results implied that LC predominantly induced cell proliferation inhibition but slightly induced cell death in cancercells.Finally, in normal mouse thymocytes, LC had little effect onthymocyte viability and cell count within 24 h treatment (Fig.2 f).These results confirm that LC selectively induced cancer cellcytotoxicity in vitroand in vivo .
LC treatment induces the expression of p21cip1gene, mRNA and protein in cancer cells We next determined the molecular mechanism for how LC could selectively inhibit tumor growth. To do so, the geneexpression profile was investigated in HepG2 cells after three dosesof LC treatment (2.5, 5, and 10 mM) for 24 h.All the up-regulatedand down-regulated genes (at least 2 fold increase or decrease at allthe three doses) after LC treatment were summarized (data notshown).Among the up-regulated genes, p21 cip1gene but not p27kip1gene, two important genes associated with cell cycle regulation, was found to be highly and dose-dependently expressed(Fig.3 a).The effects of LC treatment on p21 cip1and p27kip1 mRNA levels were next determined by real-time PCR.HepG2 cells were cultured with or without LC (2.5, 5, 10 mM) for either12 h or 24 h, RNA were prepared from the cells.
After treatmentwith LC, the p21 cip1mRNA level dose-dependently increased both at 12 h and 24 h time points, and p21cip1mRNA level is relatively higher after 12 h treatment than 24 h treatment, while p27kip1 mRNA did not show much change at these two time points(Fig. 3 b).To determine the protein levels of p21 cip1and p27kip1, Western blot assay was performed in the treated HepG2 cells.Theresults showed that after treatment with various doses of LC for48 h, p21 kip1protein levels increased in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cancer cell lines (Fig.3 c,left).Further dynamic study in HepG2 cells showed that after treatment with LC (5 mM) for 12,24, 36, and 48 h, p21 cip1time-dependently increased (Fig.3 c, middle ).In SMMC7721 cells LC treatment also increased p21 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner similar to inHepG2 cells (Fig.3 c,right).Unexpectedly, p27 protein increased in both dose- and time-dependent manners after LC treatment (Fig.
3 c) even though p27 kip1mRNA level is stable, suggesting that LC might inhibit the degradation of p27 protein. To furtherinvestigate the effect of LC on the downstream effects of p21 cip1 and p27kip1, levels of unphosphorylated Rb and phosphorylated Rb (phos-Rb) were detected.It was found that LC treatmentslightly decreased Rb protein but dramatically decreased Phos-Rbprotein (Fig.3 d).These results demonstrated that LC selectively induced p21 cip1expression.Figure 1.L-carnitine treatment fails to increase ATP concen- tration in cancer cells.(a) Cancer cells are resistant to oligomycin in the presence of D-glucose (2 g/L) but not L-glucose (2 g/L).HumanHepG2 cancer cells were cultured in the presence or absence of eitherD-glucose or L-glucose in the culture medium and treated with various doses of oligomycin (0.1, 0.25, 0.5.1.0 mg/ml) for 6 h and ATP content was assessed.Mean +SD (n = 3).* P,0.01, versus control.DM: DMSO.

Previousreports have shown that histone acetylation by HDAC inhibitorsselectively induced p21 cip1expression but not p27kip1[14,15]. Our results have demonstrated that LC selectively induced p21cip1 expression but not p27kip1(Fig.2).Therefore, we investigated the effects of LC on histone acetylation and accumulation of lysine-acetylated proteins in cultured cells.HepG2, SMMC-7721 cancercells and mouse thymocytes were treated with LC.As shown inFig.4, aand b, LC increased acetylation of histone H3 and H4 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HepG2 cancer cells.LCcould also induce accumulation of lysine-acetylated proteins inboth HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cancer cells (Fig.4 c).In primary thymocyte culture, LC dose-dependently increased histone acet- ylation similar to in cancer cells (Fig.4 d).These results suggest that LC treatment increased protein (histone) acetylation in culturedcells.
LC directly inhibits HDAC activities in vitro and in cultured cells Since LC induces histone acetylation, we then investigated whether LC could directly affect HDAC activities. A computa-tional docking model was first established.The crystal structure ofan HDAC-like protein from the hyperthermophilic bacteriumAquifex aeolicus with the HDAC inhibitor TSA has been reported [16].The structure shows the position of the essential zinc atomthat is involved in catalysis of class I/II HDAC.The chemicalstructure of LC and the docking model of complex (L-carnitine and HDAC) were shown in Fig.5, aand b, and its CDOCKER Interaction Energy and Binding Energy were 229.01 and 285.79 kcal/mol, respectively.Fig.5 bshows that one oxygen atom of carboxyl anion and oxygen atom of hydroxyl form coordination interactions with Zinc ion, with distances of 2.696 A ˚ and 2.640 A ˚, respectively.
This interaction model is different in comparison with original ligand ACT with its two oxygen atoms of carboxyl anion coordinated to Zinc ion. The carboxyl anionformed a weak hydrogen bond with Gly310, with distance of 2.966 A ˚, and the hydroxyl formed a hydrogen bond with Tyr312, with distance of 1.839 A ˚.In addition, the (CH 3)3N+group located in a hydrophobic entryway and interacted with the hydrophobic surface composed of the side chains of Leu21, Ile100, Phe152, Phe208 and Leu275.Moreover, the group formed cation- p interactions with the benzene rings of Phe152 and Phe208.This model predicted that LC has the potential to interact with HDAC active sites.To confirm this computer prediction, the direct effect of LC on activities of classical I and II HDAC were examined in vitro .Cell lysates (1, 5, 30 mg) from HepG2 cells were treated with various doses of LC and TSA or Buty.As shown in Fig.
6 a, TSA (1 mM), the strongest HDAC inhibitor, completely inhibited HDACactivities, and Buty, the relatively weak HDAC inhibitor, dramatically inhibited HDAC activity at low HDAC concentra- tion (1 mg protein) but with the increase of HDAC donor (5, 30 mg protein), the inhibiting effect of Buty (1 mM) on HDAC activity gradually declined. Similar to Buty, 5 mM dose of LC could efficiently inhibited HDAC I/II activities while 10 mM LCcompletely inhibited HDAC activities.Figure 2.LC treatment inhibits cancer cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro .(a) LC selectively inhibits HepG2 tumor growth compared with normal tissues.BALB/c nude mice were s.c.inoculated in the left armpit of each mouse with HepG2 cells (1 6106cells/mouse).When the tumor size reaches 50–75 mm3, nude mice were i.p.injected with 400 mg/kg for consecutive 15 days.Normal Balb/c mice were treated as the nude mice.Body and organ weight were detected.B.W: Body weight.Mean +SD (n = 8).

Mouse thymocytes were treated with various doses of LC (2.5, 5, 10 mM) for 24 h, cell viability was detected by MTS assay and cell numberwas count.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0049062.g002L-Carnitine Is an Endogenous HDAC Inhibitor PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e49062 To confirm this effect in cultured cells, HepG2 and SMMC- 7721 cancer cells were treated with various doses of LC and thepositive controls for 6 h or 12 h, HDAC I/II activities weredetected. Similar to the in vitro results, LC dose-dependently inhibited HDAC activities in these cultured cancer cells as well(Fig.6, band c).To further verify the effects of LC, a modified form of LC, acetyl-L-carnitine (Acetyl-LC), was used to detect itseffect on HDAC activity.As shown in Fig.6 d, acetyl-LC, similar to LC, could also inhibit HDAC activities both in vitro and in cultured cells.10 mM dose of Acetyl-LC completely inactivated HDAC I/II activity in vitro .
LC increases histone acetylation in vitro Since LC could directly inhibit HDAC activities, we next investigated the effects of LC on protein acetylation in vitro .T od o so, cell lysates from either HepG2 cells or mouse thymocytes weretreated with various doses of LC and positive control agents. Asshown in HepG2 cell lysate, LC dose-dependently increasedacetylation of H3 and H4 (Fig.6 e), and similar to TSA, LC (10 mM) also induced accumulation of lysine-acetylated proteins(Fig.6 f); By using mouse thymocyte lysate, LC had the similar effects on histone acetylation and lysine-acetylated proteins (Fig.6,gand h).These results demonstrated that LC could directly increase histone acetylation in vitro via inhibiting HDAC activities.Figure 3.LC treatment selectively induces expression of p21cip1gene, mRNA and protein in cancer cells.(a) LC induces p21cip1gene expression but not p27 and GAPDH.

Chromatin fragments from HepG2 cellscultured with or without LC (10 mM) for 12 h were immunopre-cipitated with an antibody to acetylated histone H3K9. DNA fromthe immunoprecipitate was isolated.Approximately 4-fold enrich-ment of p21 cip1promoter gene, but not p27kip1was associated with acetylated histone in the cells treated with LC, compared with thesame region isolated from cells cultured without LC (Fig.7, aand b).Buty (1 mM) induced more than 8-fold enrichment of p21 cip1 promoter gene but not p27kip1(Fig.7, aand b).Discussion Many mechanisms have been reported to be involved in HDAC inhibition-induced cytotoxicity [17,18].HDAC inhibitors not onlyinhibit cell proliferation but also induce cell death once theinhibition is strong enough.It is well known that p21 cip1is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that directly inhibits the activity of cyclin E/CDK2 andcyclin D/CDK4/6 complexes, thus inhibiting Rb phosphoryla-tion.
p21 cip1functions as a regulator of cell cycle progression at S phase. Highly expressed p21cip1would inhibit cell proliferation.What is interesting is that even though the expression of p27kip1 gene and mRNA remained unchanged after LC treatment, p27kip1 protein level dose- and time-dependently increased with LCtreatment.p27 kip1protein, like p21cip1, increased at a relatively low dose and at an early time point, which implied that p27protein accumulation is possibly regulated at a post-translationallevel.Previous studies have reported that protein modification byphosphorylation or acetylation would affect the stability ofmodified proteins [19,20].It is a general mechanism by which protein acetylation or sumoylation modulates ubiquitination- dependent proteasome proteolysis [21,22].For example, bothacetylation and ubiquitination can modify the same lysine residuesat the C terminus of p53, implicating a role of acetylation in theregulation of p53 stability [23].
Since LC could induce theacetylation of multiple proteins, protein acetylation by interferingprotein ubiquitination could be one of the mechanisms to affectp27 protein degradation, thus inducing p27 accumulation, whichneed to be confirmed in the future study. As shown, LC coulddose-dependently decreased Rb phosphorylation, a downstreamtarget of both p21 and p27 protein.Therefore, p27 proteinaccumulation together with p21 cip1high expression would contribute to LC-mediated cytotoxicity.Figure 5.Computional molecular docking of LC with HDAC.(a) The chemical structure of LC was shown.( b) The docking model of L-carnitine in active site of HDAC.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0049062.g005L-Carnitine Is an Endogenous HDAC Inhibitor PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e49062 However, we have also noticed that after LC treatment increased not only histone protein acetylation but also otherprotein acetylation as well (Fig.
4 c), which suggests that other mechanisms are possibly involved in LC-mediated cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In recent years, protein acetylation has emerged asa major posttranslational modification for proteins [24,25].The regulatory scope of lysine acetylation is broad and comparable with that of other major posttranslational modifications includingprotein phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination and methyl- ation [25].Lysine acetylation is a reversible posttranslational modification of proteins and plays a key role in regulating geneexpression.3600 lysine acetylation sites on 1750 proteins and quantified acetylation changes in response to the deacetylase inhibitors have been identified [24].It is found that lysineacetylation preferentially targets large macromolecular complexes involved in diverse cellular processes, such as chromatin remodel- ing, cell cycle, nuclear transport, splicing, and actin nucleation[24].
Other study further confirmed that virtually every enzyme in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the urea cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and glycogen metabolism was foundto be acetylated in human liver tissue, suggesting that lysine acetylation plays a major role in cell metabolisim and cell viability [26]. We have confirmed that LC is a HDAC inhibitor.It was found that LC treatment mainly arrested cancer cell proliferation and only slightly induced cell death, which is possibly due to thefollowing two reasons: on one hand, LC is not a strong HDAC inhibitor compared to classical inhibitors including TSA but LC and Buty exerted their inhibiting effects at a similar mM level; onthe other hand, relative low level of LC could efficiently induced high expression of p21 cip1which has been reported to block HDAC inhibition-induced apoptosis [27,28].We found that normal thymocytes are more resistant to LC treatment-induced cytotoxicity than cancer cells (Fig.2).
In cancercells, LC treatment dose-dependently decreased cell viability but in Figure 6. LC directly inhibits HDAC activity in vitro and in cultured cells.(a) LC directly inhibits HDAC activity in vitro .HepG2 cell lysates (1, 5, 30 mg protein) were treated with various doses of LC for 1 h, HDACI/II activity was detected.HDAC inhibitors Buty and TSA wereused as positive controls.*P ,0.05, versus vehicle control.( b, c )L C inhibits HDAC activites in cultured cells.HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cancer cells were treated with various doses of LC for either 6 h or 12 h, HDACI/II activities were detected.Buty and TSA were used as positivecontrols.* P,0.05, versus vehcile control.( d) Acetyl-LC inhibits HDAC1/ 2 activities in vitro and in cultured cells.HepG2 cells and cell lysates were exposed to various doses of Acetyl-LC for 6 h and 1 h respectively,HDACI/II activities were detected.Cell-: in cultured cells.

These results are consistent to previous reports by using HDAC inhibitor TSA [29].TSA more selectively induced cancer cytotoxicity than normal cells.This difference has been verified in the in vivo experiment (Fig.2 a).Both in vitro and in cultured cells, it was found that LC treatment not only inhibited HDAC activities and induced histone acetylation in cancer cells but also in normal cells, but the cytotoxicity induced in normal and cancer cells are different.Therefore, even though the mechanism is unclear, the active states of HDAC in the cells are possibly responsible for the difference [29].
As regard to the different effects of LC on normal and tumor tissues, besides the sensitivity to HDAC inhibition, other mechanisms are possibly involved in this difference. Since normal lymphocytes were sensitive while cancer cells were resistant to oligomycin treatment for ATP generation, this implies that in cancer cells, the oxidative phosphorylation system worked in normal cells but not in cancer cells consistent to previous reports [30,31].In normal thymocytes, LC treatment efficiently induced ATP generation, indicating that LC could be used in normal cells, while in cancer cells LC treatment failed to generate ATP, indicating that LC could not be used for ATP generation.Therefore, reasonably LC would have more potential to affectother targets like HDAC in cancer cells than in normal cells.
Even though in cultured cancer cells LC could slightly induced cell death, no cell death in tumor tissues was found like in other normal tissues (data not shown), this is possibly due to that the LC concentration in vivo is not as high as in vitro . LC has been recognized to play an important role in cellular energy metabolism.The current study has found that HDAC is a new molecular target of LC.Many studies have been done to determine the effectiveness of LC for fat burning.Also it has been clinically used in cancerpatients with fatigue and carnitine deficiency [32,33].It has been reported that a deficiency of LC is a risk factor for liver cancer.Furthermore, it was found that long-term LC supplementationmay prevent the development of liver cancer [34,35].Even thoughit has been used under many clinical conditions, the mechanism isstill unclear.HDAC inhibitor has been developed as anti-cancerdrugs [36,37].
It has been reported previously that histoneacetylation mediated by HDAC inhibition could block cellproliferation and induce cell death [17,18,38]. These data verifiedthat LC mediated histone acetylation viainhibiting HDAC which at least partially contributed to its cytotoxicity.Therefore, LCwould be promising in cancer therapeutics.LC is not as strong as other HDAC inhibitors like TSA, therefore, LC alone may not be a more potent anti-cancer agentthan other HDAC inhibitors, but the importance relies on that LCis an intracellular molecule well known to transport acyl CoA forATP production under physiological conditions.It has beenreported that intracellular LC concentration is at a low mM level[39,40], and this dose of LC is at a level to at least partially inhibitHDAC activities in most of the cells.
We have predicted that LChas the potential to interact with HDAC, therefore, it is possiblethat the cellular LC and HDAC are in a binding state underphysiological conditions, which is worth to be further investigatedin the future work.
