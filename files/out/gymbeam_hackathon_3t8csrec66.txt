Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed 14 pathways and 46 differentially expressed genes involved in lipid metabolism.Sphingolipid metabolism, glycerolipid met abolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis and steroid hormone biosynthesis were signi ﬁcantly enriched pathways. In these pathways, three differential genes phospholipid phosphatase 1a ( PLPP1a ), phospholipid phosphatase 2b (PLPP2b), cytochrome P450 21a2 ( CYP21a2 )w e r e consistent with the change trend of lipid content, and the other three differential genes aldo-keto reductase family 1 member D1 ( AKR1D1 ), uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid transferase 1a1 ( UGT1a1 ), cytochrome P450 1a ( CYP1a )w e r e opposite.Metabolomic analysis revealed that primary bile acid biosynthesis,sphingolipid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis and biosynthesis ofunsaturated fatty acids were all critical for rice ﬁeld eel metabolic changes in response to vitamin A.
Six important differential metabolites (eicosapentaenoic acid,sphinganine, 11-beta-hydroxyprogesterone, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, cholic acid, and glycochenodeoxycholate) were identi ﬁed and have provided new insights into how vitamin A regulates lipid deposition. I ntegrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses revealed that primary bile acid biosynthesis was the only remarkably enrichedpathway in both the transcriptome and metabolome while that sphingosine was themain metabolite.Based on the above results, we have concluded that vitamin Apromotes lipid deposition in the rice ﬁeld eel through the primary bile acid synthesis pathway, and lipid deposits are widely stored in cell membranes, mainly in the form ofsphingosine.These results will provide reference data to help improve our understanding of how vitamin A regulates lipid metabolism.

In contrast, the whole-body crude lipid contentlevels of Atlantic salmon ( Ørnsrud et al., 2002 ), groupers (Mohamed et al., 2003 ) and juvenile ﬂounder ( Hernandez et al., 2005 )w e r ef o u n dt os i g n i ﬁcantly decrease with increases in dietary VA. Furthermore ( Thompson et al., 1995 ) found that VA intake had no signi ﬁcant effect on the body composition of rainbow trout and ( Yu et al., 2019 )f o u n dt h a t VA had no signi ﬁcant effect on the crude lipid content of whole tilapia ﬁsh.There are many mechanisms by which VA regulates lipid metabolism, including gene transcription factors that regulatelipid synthesis and lipid oxidation, signaling pathways related to lipid metabolism, number of adipocytes, secretion of adipocytokines, and epigenetic modi ﬁcations in mammals (Wang and Yan, 2017 ).Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are a class of li pid-activated transcription factors that regulate lipid metabolism.
VA de ﬁciency can decrease transcription levels of PPAR β, resulting in increased levels of polyunsatura ted fatty acids, such as linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic, and docosahexaenoic ( Yang et al., 2005 ). The activation of PPAR αcan be inhibited by the liver X receptor -sterol regulatory element-bin ding protein-1c pathway which downregulates the expression of fat synthesis genes, and theactivation of liver X receptor inhibits PPAR α-induced fatty acid oxidation ( Tomohiro et al., 2003 ).Studies have suggested that VA promotes fat synthesis, which may be associated withepigenetic modi ﬁcations.When VA is present, polycomb repression complexes can rapidl y induce the separation of the zinc ﬁnger protein 423 ( Zfp423 ) promoter, demethylation of the Zfp423 histone, and the expression of Zfp423 to promote fat synthesis ( Wang et al., 2016 ).Kim et al.
(2013) showed that the Wnt/ β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and that all-trans- retinoicacid inhibits the d ifferentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes through the transcriptional activation of β- catenin, which affects fat synthesis. The effects of VA on animal lipid metabolism are not consistent, as the mechanism is complex and there are organiza tional differences, and further research is thus required.The Monopterus albus b e l o n g st ot h eg e n u se e l so f synbranchiidae and it is an eco nomically important species in China.In 2022 years, its annual production was334215 tons.The regulation of lipid levels by VA in rice ﬁeld eels, however, has not yet been reported.
Therefore, this study aims to explore the possible mechanism of VA- mediated regulation of lipid metabolism in rice ﬁeld eels through comprehensive analysis of transcriptomics andmetabolomics.2 Materials and methods 2.1 Diet preparation The fundamental feed formula is shown in Table 1 . Fish meal was used as main protein sources.VA acetate (500,000 IU/g, Maclin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) is the supplemental source of VA.Three isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were formulatedadding VA 0, 200 and 16000 IU/kg (3 201, 4 730 and 16890 IU/kg,actually) denoted as LA, MA and HA groups respectively.All rawmaterials were screened for 80 mesh and thoroughly mixed.Afteradding 16% moisture, the pellets were made by the pelletizer at120 °C.After air drying, the feed were stored at −20°C.
2.2 Chemicals and reagents Concentrated sulfuric acid, boric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, petroleum ether, methanol, acetonitrile acetone, sodiumsulfate and anhydrous ethanol purchased from Nanchang Jinshachemical raw materials Co. LTD.Trizol reagent, electrophoreticbuffer, Reverse transcription kit, loading buffer and SYBR Premix Ex Taq kite purchased from Jiangxi Guanyin Biotechnology Co.LTD.2.3 Experimental animals and sample collection The juvenile Monopterus albus were arti ﬁcially bred by our team.All ﬁsh were reared temporarily for 14 days to acclimate to the conditions.After fasting for1 day, 480 ﬁsh (7.3 ± 0.02 g) were randomly assigned to 12 separate tanks of 3 groups (HA, MA, and LA, four repetitions pergroup) with 40 ﬁsh per tank.Each tank was ﬁlled with the right amount of fresh grass, Eichhornia crassipes .F i s hw e r ef e d3 –5% of the body weight once daily at 18:00 p.m.A tuc k net removed the feces and residual feeds.
The breeding experiment lasted for 10 weeks and replaced withclean water weekly. The environmental conditions were: water depth0.4 m; temperature, 28 °C±1°C; dissolved oxygen >5.0 mg/L.After the feeding trial, the ﬁsh were anaesthetized using MS222.Three ﬁsh from each tank were sampled randomly.The liver from twelve ﬁsh each group were dissected into 1.5 mL tubes and stored in−80°C for further RNA extraction.Three biological replicates were used for transcriptome sequencing and six biological replicateswere used for metabolome detection.The remaining three ﬁsh each group were used to detect body composition.2.4 Effects of dietary VA level on Monopterus albus The crude protein, crude lipid, moisture and ash in whole ﬁsh body were measured following the methods of the Association of Of ﬁcial Analytical Chemists.The crude pr otein was determined by Kjeldahl method (FOSS, Kjeltec TM 8200).T he crude lipid was estimated by using Soxhlet extraction method (FOSS, Soxtec 2050).
The moisture was determined by drying samples in an oven at 105°C until constant weight. The ash was determined by combustion in a muf ﬂef u r n a c ea t 550°Cf o r4h .Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 02Huo et al.10.3389/fphys.2023.1254992 2.5 RNA extraction and transriptome sequencing Liver RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, United States) according to manufacturer ’s instructions.Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to monitor RNA degradation.The Nano-Drop 2000 spectrophotometer was used to detect RNAconcentration and purity.Further, the Agilent 2100 RNA6000 Nano kitwas used to assess RNA integrity.Higher qualityRNA was selected for high-throughput sequencing.Three RNAreplicates of each sample were used to build RNA-seq library.Aftertotal RNA was extracted, the ﬁrst strand cDNA was synthesized by random hexers and reverse transcriptase, and the second strand cDNA was synthesized by DNA polymerase I and RNase H.
Then, acDNA library was constructed for sequencing. The cDNA librarywas sequenced using Illumina HiSeqTM4000 by Gene DenovoBiotechnology Co.(Guangzhou, China).The transcriptomeresults were compared pair-to-pair.2.6 Transriptome experimental validation using qPCR Six genes ( Table 2 ) were selected randomly for validation of RNA-Seq data by qPCR using a SYBR Premix Ex Taq kit(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions.The same RNA samples were used for both Illumina library synthesisand the qPCR veri ﬁcation assay.The ﬁrst strand cDNA was obtained from 2 μg of total RNA using a PrimeScript ﬁrst strand cDNA synthesis kit (Takara, Dalian, China).Melting curve analyseswere performed following ampli ﬁcation.The speci ﬁc primers used for qPCR are listed in Additional Table 2 , and 18 s gene was used as an endogenous control.The thermal pro ﬁle for SYBR Green qPCR was 95 °C for 90 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 15 s, 72°C for 20 s.
2.7 Metabolites extraction LC-MS/MS analysis The Liver samples were thawed at 4°C, appropriate samples were added into the pre-cooled methanol/acetonitrile/water solution (2: 2, v/v), vortex mixing, ultrasonic for 30 min, standing at −20°C for 10 min. After 14,000 g at 4°C for 20 min, supernatant vacuum drying, adding 100 μL acetonitrile solution during mass spectrometry (acetonitrile: Water = 1:1, v/v) redissolved, vortex,14,000 g centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min.Then, supernatant was taken for analysis.Analysis was performed using an UHPLC (1290 In ﬁnity LC, Agilent Technologies) coupled to a quadrupole time-of- ﬂight (AB Sciex TripleTOF 6600) in Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co.,Ltd.The metabolome results were compared inpairs.2.8 The integrated analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomics data Firstly, differential genes and differential metabolites related to lipid metabolism were identi ﬁed by KEGG pathway analysis.
Secondly, O2PLS (two-way orthogonal projections to latestructures) model was established to analyze the relationshipbetween them. Finally, pearson correlation coef ﬁcients were used to assess the correlation between differential genes and differentialmetabolites.2.9 Statistical analysis The results were expressed as mean ± SD.(standard deviation of the mean) and were analyzed using one-way ANOVA in SPSS19.0 software.Any signi ﬁcant differences were further investigated by comparing the group means using Turkey ’s test.Statistical signi ﬁcance was considered if p<0.05.3 Results 3.1 Effects of dietary VA levels on Monopterus albus The crude lipid content in the whole body was signi ﬁcantly different ( p<0.05) among the different treatments, and that in the whole body of the LA group was signi ﬁcantly lower than that of the MA and HA groups ( Table 3 ).The crude lipid content of the whole body increased with increasing dietary VA levels.

10.3389/fphys.2023.1254992 differences in crude protein, moisture, and ash in the whole body were not signi ﬁcant. 3.2 Transcriptomic analysis To validate the transcriptome data, 6 DEGs were selected randomly for qPCR.Althought the test DEGs displayed differentexpression levels ( Figure 1 ), in general, the qPCR results showed a positive correlation with transcriptome, indicating the reliability and accuracy of the transcriptome analysis.After removing the low-quality reads, 50.52 million clean reads were obtained.A total of 32.0 Gb of data were generated by Illuminasequencing.The results of transcriptome have been submitted toNCBI (SRA accession no.SRP398570).Comparative transcriptomeanalysis identi ﬁed 1323 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the three groups ( Figure 2 ).Based on the KEGG annotation, lipid metabolism-related DEGs and pathways were further analyzed.A total of 46 DEGs were enriched in 14 lipid metabolism-relatedpathways ( Table 4 ).
Among them, LAvsMA contained 10 pathways and 16 DEGs; MAvsHA contained 14 pathways and36 DEGs; LAvsHA contained 14 pathways and 46 DEGs. Signi ﬁcance analysis revealed that sphingolipid metabolism (ko00600), glycerolmetabolism (ko00561), steroid hormone biosynthesis (ko00140), andprimary bile acid biosynthesis (ko00120) were signi ﬁcantly enriched.There were 16 DEGs in the four signi ﬁcantly enriched pathways.Due to the crude lipid content was continuously rising, further trendanalysis of the screened DEGs was necessary.Trend analysis revealedthatPLPP1a ,PLPP2b ,a n d CYP21a2 were continuously upregulated, AKR1D1 ,UGT1a1 ,a n d CYP1a were continuously downregulated.The relationships between six genes and the four signi ﬁcantly enriched pathways are shown in Table 5 .3.3 Metabolite extraction and LC-MS/MS analysis According to analyses of the metabolites, 10878 metabolites and 8540 metabolites were obtained in positive and negative modes,respectively.
Based on the variable important in projection (VIP)values of OPLS-DA, the signi ﬁcantly different metabolites were screened based on a VIP ≥1 and p≤0.05. In negative ion modes, a total of 201 different metabolites were detected in the three groups ( Figure 3 ).To explore the lipid metabolism pathways, we selected different lipid-relevant metabolites for KEGGenrichment analysis.The ﬁve lipid metabolism pathways were mainly related to arachidonic acid metabolism, primary bile acidbiosynthesis, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, sphingolipidmetabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis.There were sixmetabolites identi ﬁed in the ﬁve pathways: eicosapentaenoic acid, sphinganine, 11-beta-hydroxyproge sterone, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, cholic acid, and glycochenodeoxycholate ( Table 6 ).In positive ion modes, no metabolites were detected.
3.4 Integrative transcriptome and metabolome analysis To screen for DEGs and different metabolites associated with lipid metabolism, integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses were performed using the O2PLS, correlation coef ﬁcient models and KEGG pathway. The common KEGG pathways wereanalyzed for the differential genes and metabolites.Integrativeanalysis revealed that primary bile acid and steroid hormonebiosynthesis were enriched in both the transcriptome andmetabolome.TABLE 2 The information of primers used to qPCR.

Therefore, the O2PLS model was very reliable for explaining the total variation in the comprehensive analysis oftranscriptome and metabolome .The combined loading diagram of metabolites and transcripts was constructed according to theloading values shown in Figure 4 . High absolute loading values indicated a strong correlation bet ween the differential genes and differential metabolites.DEGs and differential metabolitesfarther from the origin were more closely related to each other.The correlation between metabolites and genes were evaluated by calculating pearson coef ﬁcients.The correlation matrix of the heat map revealed negative (blue) and positive (red) correlations between lipid- related differential metabolites and genes ( Figure 5 ).Correlation network maps showed lipid- related differential genes or meta bolites at important associated positions ( Figure 6 ).
Sphinganine was the main associated metabolite and it was correlated with ﬁve DEGs.4 Discussion Currently, the effects of VA on lipid metabolism in ﬁsh have been reported, however there are few studies on its regulatory mechanism. Therefore, this study aims to explore the possible mechanism of VA-mediated regulation of lipid metabolismthrough comprehensive analysis of transcriptomics andmetabolomics.4.1 VA and bile acid biosynthesis The primary bile acid biosynthesis pathway was signi ﬁcantly enriched in both the transcriptome and metabolome, indicating thatthere is a complex interaction between VA and bile acids.Retinoicacid receptor ( RAR), farnesoid X receptor ( FXR), and retinoid X receptor ( RXR) are the main regulators of VA and bile acid homeostasis ( Zoubek et al., 2017 ).
In the liver, VA and its metabolites activate RAR and RXR, generate RAR/RXR heterodimers, and regulate bile acid synthesis and metabolism ( LiTABLE 3 Effects of dietary VA levels on the nutritional composition of whole ﬁsh.

Studies have shown that VA inhibits the expression of the bile salt synthesis rate-limiting enzyme CYP7A1 , thereby reducing bile generation ( Jahn et al., 2016 ). In this study, AKR1D1 was inhibited instead of CYP7A1 .AKR1D1 plays an important role in steroid metabolism ( Gathercole et al., 2021 ), but biologically, it is better known for its involvement in bileacid biosynthesis, where it catalyzes a key step that introducesthe 5 β-conﬁguration into primary bile acids ( Russell, 2009 ).This decrease in cholic acid levels may be due to the inhibition ofAKR1D1 .Another reason is that cholic acid is used to produce 12α-hydroxylated bile acid, which lead to hepatic lipid accumulation (Maegawa et al., 2021 ).In contrast, the glycochenodeoxycholate content was found to be increased in the metabolome.Glycochenodeoxycholate is a hydrophobic bile salt and that cancause lipid accumulation in the liver ( Chen and Chen, 2014 ).
Simultaneously, glycochenodeoxycholate can increase lipidsolubility and promote intestinal absorption ( Wu et al., 2016 ). Notably, high concentrations of glycochenodeoxycholate induced hepatocyte apoptosis ( Wang et al., 2005 ).This may also explain why high levels of liver fat are disadvantageous in ﬁsh.FIGURE 2 The venn of DEGs distribution in three groups.TABLE 4 The fourteen lipid metabolism-related pathways.

10.3389/fphys.2023.1254992 4.2 VA and fatty acid synthesis Fatty acids are components of various molecules, including phospholipids, sphingolipids, and esters. The regulation of fatty acid metabolism by VA has been con ﬁrmed in other studies (Chen and Chen, 2014 ;Blaner, 2019 ).The genes for fatty acid extension, desaturation and synt hesis pathways can be regulated by VA.This is achieved through re tinoic acid (RA), a product of VA metabolism.Theﬁrst step in fatty acid synthesis is the conversion of acetyl- CoA to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase.It is then catalyzedby fatty acid synthase to form palmitic acid.Palmitic acid can be prolonged and desaturated to produce fatty acids with longer chains and double bonds ( Kihara, 2012 ;Zhang et al., 2016 ).
Elongases add two carbon atoms each time to create longer-chain fatty acids.Desaturases introduce double bonds into saturated andunsaturated fatty acids, resulting in the production ofmonounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively. The mechanism of VA regulate fatty acid synthesis has beenextensively studied.Studies have shown that when VA de ﬁciency, the mRNA levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 were reduced; when RA treatment, the mRNA levels were increased ( Yang et al., 2021 ).Ayuso et al.(2015) found that VA increases the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in pork.Similar to the results of ourstudy, the levels of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoicand hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, increased signi ﬁcantly.
This is probably because of the increase in stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1.Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 was responsible for the formation of double bond and regulation of lipogenesis in the process of fatty acid synthesis ( Koeberle et al., 2016 ;ALJohani et al., 2017 ). RA could induce stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 mRNA expression ( Miller et al., 1997 ) and desaturase index in adipose tissues ( Gorocica-Buen ﬁl et al., 2008 ).FIGURE 4 Loading plots for the differential metabolites and differential genes.Note: loading value represents the explanatory ability of a variable (metab olite/ gene) in each component (that is, the contribution to the difference between groups).The positive and negative loading value represents the positiv eo r negative correlation with another group.The greater the absolute value of the load, the stronger the correlation.FIGURE 5Heat plot showing the correlations between differential metabolites and differential genes.
Note: red and blue indicate positive and negativecorrelations between the transcriptomics and metabolomics data, respectively. Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 08Huo et al.10.3389/fphys.2023.1254992 4.3 VA and phospholipid synthesis Oliveros et al.(2007) found that VA de ﬁciency induced a hypolipidemic effect by decreasing the total phospholipid content inthe liver, owing to low phosphatidy lcholine synthesis and enhanced fatty acid oxidation in rats, and this was consistent with the results of our study.In the present study, PLPP1a and PLPP2b were signi ﬁcantly upregulated with increasing VA content.PLPP1a and PLPP2b arephospholipid phosph atases that belong to the lipid phosphate phosphatase family.
Lipid phosphate phosphatase has wide substrateselectivity and can hydrolyze a variety of lipid phosphoric acidscontaining single lipid bonds, i ncluding phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol pyrophosphate, and sphingosine 1-phosphate, and it participates in the synthesis of glycerol ( Toke et al., 1998;Li et al., 2017 ;Tang and Brindley, 2020 ). The signi ﬁcant increase in sphinganine levels in the metabolome may be related to thehydrolysis of sphingosine 1-phosphate.4.4 VA and steroid hormone synthesis VA is essential for the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones.The expression of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 was increased by VA de ﬁciency in the hypothalamus (C62.5%) and hippocampus (C104.7%) ( Marissal-Arvy et al., 2013 ).RA treatment could reverse the effects of VA de ﬁciency on 11 β-hydroxysteroid expression.
The inhibitory effect of retinoidson 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 expression has been demonstrated peripherally in the liver and visceral fat of WNIN/Obobese rats ( Sakamuri et al., 2011 ), in the adipose tissue of mice (Sakuta et al., 2006 ), and in myotubes in vitro (Aubry and Odermatt, 2009 ). In contrast, in this study, the level of 11 β- hydroxyprogesterone was increased by VA, but this discrepancymay be species related.Within the cell, 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 catalyzes the regeneration of activeglucocorticoids, thereby amplifying their action ( Marissal-Arvy et al., 2013 ).Similarly, in our study, we found that CYP21a2 was associated with glucocorticoid synthesis ( Heidelberg, 2008 ) which was signi ﬁcantly upregulated.In this study, comparative metabolomics and transcriptomics were applied to investigate lipid metabolite changes in rice ﬁeld eel when fed different levels of VA.
Comparative transcriptome analysisrevealed that VA affected multiple lipid metabolic pathways,especially sphingolipid and glycerin metabolism, and steroidhormone and primary bile acid biosynthesis. Metabolite analysisrevealed that the levels of lipids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid,sphinganine, 11-beta-hydroxyproge sterone, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and glycochenodeoxyc holate, increased signi ﬁcantly.Integrative analyses of the transcriptome and metabolome revealed a signi ﬁcant correlation between differential metabolites and differential genes,suggesting that these are the main metabolic pathways.Theseﬁndings provide reliable models at t he transcriptional and metabolic levels which will facilitate further in vestigation into the effects of VA on lipid metabolism.FIGURE 6 Network showing the correlations between metabolites and genes.Note: circles represent metabolites and squares represent genes.The absolutevalue of pearson coef ﬁcient ≥0.5.
