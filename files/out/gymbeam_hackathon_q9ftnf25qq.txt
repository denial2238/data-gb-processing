Abstract Background: Using sports supplements is common among athletes. The presence of anabolic steroids in sports supplements as a hormonal contaminant can increase production eﬃciency .Since anabolic steroids cause health problems and result in positive doping tests in athletes, it is important to investigate their presence in the supplement preparations consumed by athletes.Objectives: This paper aims to simultaneously determine ten anabolic steroids by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) method in sports supplements.Methods: Chromatographic analysis was conducted on glass silica gel 60F254 plates.The extracts loaded on silica gel plates are subjected to programed multiple development (PMD) to separate anabolic androgenic steroids (AASs).Densitometric scanning is carried out at the wavelength of 245 and 366nm.The method was validated according to the ICH guidelines.
Results: Spots at retardation factor (Rf) 0.72 (elution system 1), 0.4 (elution system 1), 0.29 (elution system 2), 0.25 (elution system 2), 0.1 (elution system 1), 0.65 (elution system 2), 0.59 (elution system 1), 0.44 (elution system 1), 0.8 (elution system 3), and 0.82 (elution system 3) values were recognized as 19-nor androstenedione, 19-nortestosterone, methyl testosterone, clostebol, stanozolol, trenbolone enanthate, oxymetholone, oxandrolone, testosterone enanthate, and nandrolone decanoate, respectively . The linear ranges were 25 - 250 µg/mL for oxymetholone, 7 - 50 µg/mL for 19-nor androstenedione, 19-nortestosterone, and oxandrolone, and 3 - 20µg/mL for methyl testosterone, clostebol, stanozolol, trenbolone enanthate, testosterone enanthate, and nandrolone decanoate.The developed method is validated by acceptable precision (CV < 20%) and good accuracy (94% < R < 114%).
The value of limit of detection (LOD) for all derivatives was in the range of 0.02 - 0.16 µg/spot (20-160 µg/g of supplement), while limit of quantitation (LOQ) was found to be in the range of 0.06 - 0.5 µg/spot (60 - 500 µg/g of supplement). Fifty sports supplement samples as real sample were collected and analyzed.None of the samples screened positive using the HPTLC method.Conclusions: In the present study , the fast, cheap, and simple HPTLC method could be used for the multi-residue analysis of ten anabolic androgenic steroids in sports supplements.Keywords: Androgen, Dietary Supplement, HPTLC, Simultaneous Analysis, Steroids 1.Background According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) deﬁnition, a dietary supplement is a product that is taken by mouth that contains "dietary ingredients" to add more nutritional value to the diet (1).
Dietary supplement consumption has been increasing in recent years, and it seems that elite athletes use sup- plements much more than amateur athletes (2, 3). There are several reasons for athletes’ consumption of sportssupplements as a subgroup of dietary supplements: en- hancing performance and post-exercise recovery , improv- ing health status, compensating micronutrient deﬁcien- cies and macronutrient needs, preventing or treating ill- ness, and manipulating the physique (4-6).Dietary supplement manufacturers do not require FDA approval before producing or releasing to the market.No law requires the manufacturer to prove the correct claim before it appears on the product label.When a dietary supplement enters the marketplace and the product poses Copyright © 2022, Author(s).

Saadabadi Z et al.a risk to consumer health or is misbranded and contains contaminants, the FDA’s role begins (7, 8).The lack of local rules and ease of access to these products in online shops, supermarkets, and parallel markets in the gym creates new concerns about their safety , composition, and adulterants.There is also a concern speciﬁcally about supplements con- taining anabolic steroids ﬁlled in underground laborato- ries and sold illegally in the market (9-11).
The prevalence of positive doping tests in those us- ing supplements is 3.5 times compared to those who do not use any supplements, so consumption of contami- nated products with prohibited substances announced by the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA), whether intention- ally or unintentionally , will cause a positive doping test for athletes in professional competitions (12-14). Among sports supplements, anabolic-androgenic steroids have been banned since the mid-1970; nevertheless, anabolic an- drogenic steroids (AAS) is a major latent contaminant in muscle-building supplements and the most abused class of drugs in competitive sport (half of the 4500 adverse an- alytical ﬁndings in doping testing at WADA laboratories) (15-17).On the other hand, the improper use of AAS among youth and adolescents causes serious medical problems such as hair loss, acne, sexual and reproductive dysfunc- tion, psychiatric disorder, and an increase in cardiovascu- lar risk (18).
Due to the mentioned side eﬀects and the prevalence of AAS as a contaminant in supplements and the evidence such as the fact that even small amounts of 2.5 µg of a nan- drolone precursor (19-norandrostenedione) in 5 g of crea- tine supplement cause a positive urine test for 25% of con- sumers under WADA rules (19), a method for simultaneous assay of AAS with high accuracy , precision, availability , fast and low cost is needed to screen supplements and prevent intentional and unintentional doping. Most of the various methods used for analyzing AASs in counterfeit products involve a GC-MS (20-22) or LC- MS/MS (23-26) for the separation/detection step.We de- veloped a simple extraction method and then used high- performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) to detect and quantify the mixture of 10 AASs, which have not been previously determined simultaneously by this method.
The method’s advantage over the conventional LC and GC- based methods is that it allows multiple sample detection in one run with acceptable limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ). Furthermore, the liquid or gas chromatography instrumentation is more expensive than HPTLC and more complex to operate, but HPTLC is user- friendly and easily available.2.Methods 2.1.Materials Sulfuric acid (purity > 95 - 97%), acetone, chloroform, methanol, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, and n-Hexane (an- alytical grade) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).19-norandrostenedione (purity > 99.5%), 19- nortestosterone (purity > 98%), methyltestosterone (pu- rity > 98%), clostebol (purity > 99.9%), stanozolol (pu- rity > 98.38%), trenbolone enanthate (purity > 99.9%), oxymetholone (purity > 97%), oxandrolone (purity > 97%), testosterone enanthate (purity > 96%), nandrolone de- canoate (purity > 95%) were purchased from LGC.
HPTLC plates, silica gel 60 F 254 20 cm ×10 cm were from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt. 2.2.Instrumentation and Chromatographic Condition A CAMAG system, equipped with automatic thin-layer chromatography (TLC) sampler 4 (ATS4), automatic devel- oping chamber 2 (ADC2), TLC visualizer 2, TLC scanner 4, in- tegrated software of WinCats (version 1.2.3), and precoated silica gel TLC-cards was used for the analysis of AASs.The samples and standards were spotted on the TLC sheet as 8mm width bands by CAMAG 25 µL syringe using ATS4 CA- MAG.A ﬁxed application rate of 0.1 µL.s-1was selected, and the distance between the two bands was 18.7 mm.Several mobile phases with various ratios were examined to opti- mize the retardation factor (Rf) values of the compounds.The plate was transferred to ADC2, and the development was carried out with an optimized mobile phase under un- saturation conditions.
Based on our experience, no satu- ration condition is necessary during the TLC development process, and saturation condition has no eﬀect on Rf val- ues. The TLC scanning was performed on CAMAG TLC scan- ner 4 at 254 nm, 366 nm, and visible (Table 1).Detection un- der UV 366nm and daylight required the plate’s pretreat- ment with 10% sulfuric acid in methanol and heating for 10min at 100°C.Eventually , an evaluation of the plate by WinCats software using the peak areas of spots was per- formed.2.3.Standard Solutions The standard substances were kept according to the supplier’s directions.Stock solutions were prepared at the ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg/mL in methanol solvent.2.4.Samples and Extraction The samples included in this study were whey proteins for athletes collected from pharmacy stores in the city to verify the presence/absence of AASs adulterants.The 50 col- lected samples consisted of solids tablet (n = 9) and pow- ders (n = 41).2 Iran J Pharm Res.2022; 21(1):e127444.

One gram NaCl, 4 g ( ±5%) anhy- drous MgSO 4, 1 g trisodium citrate dihydrate, and 0.5 g dis- odium hydrogen citrate sesquihydrate were ﬁlled in a 15 mL PTFE centrifuge tube. Then the samples (0.5 g) were dis- solved in 10 mL water/acetonitrile (50% v/v) and added to the tube.The mixture was shaken vigorously for 10 s, vor- tex mixed for 1 min, and then centrifuged for 3 min at 4000 rpm.One milliliter aliquot from the upper part of the ex- tract was transferred into a microcentrifuge tube contain- ing 150 mg ( ±10%) MgSO 4, 50 mg ( ±10%) of primary sec- ondary amines (PSA) sorbent, and 50 mg C18 ( ±10%).The mixture was then shaken, vortex mixed, and centrifuged for 3 min at 4000 rpm.Five hundred microliters of acetoni- trile extract were transferred to HPTLC vials.2.5.Method Validation The method was validated based on the ICH guidelines by calculating the following parameters: linearity , LOD, and LOQ , speciﬁcity and selectivity , precision, and accu- racy .
A sample analyzed by the LC-MS/MS system that had none of the target compounds was used as a blank matrix. The matrix-blank samples (solid and liquid types) were an- alyzed to conﬁrm the selectivity and determine potential interference due to the endogenous substances in the tar- get matrices.Linearity was evaluated by determining stan- dard calibration solutions prepared three times at ﬁve con- centration levels over the range of 3 - 250 µg/mL (the linear- ity range for each androgen is given in Table 2).The mea- sured peak areas versus the corresponding concentrations were processed using the equation of calibration curves created by the least square regression method.The cali- bration curves were evaluated based on the value of cor- relation coeﬃcients (r).The standard calibration curve’slinearity was investigated at ﬁve diﬀerent concentration levels, and three replicate measurements were conducted.
The LOD was obtained by analyzing matrix-blank samples that were spiked at four concentrations (5, 10, 20, and 40 ng/spot), and it was found at a concentration value giv- ing a signal-to-noise response (S/N) > 3. The LOQ was de- ﬁned as the lower level of the calibration curve (e.g., 60 ng/spot for clostebol), which should give a signal-to-noise response (S/N) > 10 with an acceptable precision and accu- racy (%CV < 20%).The speciﬁcity of the method was studied by simultaneously analyzing standard solutions and blank samples.The spots for AASs in the sample were conﬁrmed by comparing the Rf of the samples’ peaks with that of the standard.Any bands in the solvent blank, matrix-blank samples, and spiked matrix-blank samples were compared with standard solutions and analyzed for selectivity assess- ment.Also, the presence of any interfering substance at the speciﬁc Rf with a similar structure, such as corticosteroids, was checked.
The precision of the method was deﬁned by inter-day and intra-day analysis studies. To evaluate the intra-day and inter-day precision, the blank samples of the whey protein were spiked at two diﬀerent concentra- tions (0.2 and 0.4 µg/spot).The intra-day precision of the method was determined by spotting the spiked samples in triplicate on the same day .The inter-day precision assays were determined in triplicate on three diﬀerent days.Even- tually , results were statistically evaluated in terms of % RSD.The accuracy of the analytical method was expressed through percent recovery (%R).This item was determined by comparing the peak area from spiked samples to stan- dard solutions at equivalent concentrations.Iran J Pharm Res.2022; 21(1):e127444.3 Saadabadi Z et al.Table 2.

Analysis of Real Samples Fifty sports supplement samples were collected from the retail market in Tehran during the time period of May 2020 to May 2021. All the samples were subjected to the sample preparation process explained in the samples and extraction section.None of the samples were screened as positive using the HPTLC method, and the validity of the results was reconﬁrmed by a validated LC-MS/MS method.3.Results The suggested method can separate the anabolic an- drogenic steroids in sports supplements, using a simple, fast, and eﬃcient sample preparation procedure that guar- antees accurate results.Diﬀerent combinations of organic solvents (e.g., chloroform-acetone-ethyl acetate-n-hexane) in various volume compositions were used in this study .The optimal mobile phase for the ten steroids at the be- ginning is chloroform/acetone (9: 1).
Using this eluent solvent, ﬁve AASs get separated (19-nor androstene- dione, 19-nortestosterone, stanozolol, oxymetholone, and oxandrolone) and ﬁve other AASs (methyl testosterone, clostebol, trenbolone enanthate, testosterone enanthate, and nandrolone decanoate) appear as two bands. In order to separate these ﬁve AASs, the plate was transferred to an- other tank, and a second eluent solvent system used ethyl acetate/n-hexane (6.5: 3.5) to separate methyl testosterone, clostebol, and trenbolone enanthate or cyclohexane/ethyl acetate/methanol (8: 2: 0.5) to separate testosterone enanthate and nandrolone decanoate.The retardation factor of each standard is listed in Ta- ble 1, based on the speciﬁc mobile phase mentioned below .Also, chromatograms of all analytes with peak purity chart were placed in the Supplementary File.At the end of the chromatographic run, the plates were visualized at 254 nm.
The plates were also immersed in sul- phuric acid solution (10% in methanol) and then visualized at 366 nm and visible light. All the AASs appeared as clear spots at 254 nm except oxandrolone and stanozolol.Oxan- drolone and stanozolol can be identiﬁed at 366 nm only after spraying sulphuric acid solution and can be dried in the oven at 100°C for 10 minutes.Quantifying all steroids was performed using the wavelength of 254 nm except for oxandrolone and stanozolol, which are quantiﬁed af- ter immersing the plate in sulphuric acid solution (10% in methanol) and measurement of absorbance at 366 nm.The HPTLC-chromatographic method was validated based on the ICH guidelines in terms of speciﬁcity , linearity , limit of quantiﬁcation, limit of detection, accuracy , and precision (27).The ﬁrst step of the method development was deter- mining the LOD and the LOQ for each hormone.Table 3 presents the LODs and LOQs for the AASs included in the screening.
Table 2 shows linearity parameters (slopes, intercepts, and correlation coeﬃcients obtained on three diﬀerent supplements) for each AAS included in the present study . The method showed good linearity over the range from the LOQ of each steroid to 1000 µg.g-1of nutritional supple- ment.As mentioned before, the precision of the method was determined through intra-day precision (repeatabil- 4 Iran J Pharm Res.2022; 21(1):e127444.Saadabadi Z et al.Table 3.

Table 4 shows the results of the precision studies expressed as the coeﬃcient of vari- ation of the measured peak area (%CV) for AASs in the an- alyzed samples at two diﬀerent concentrations. The accu- racy of this method was calculated through the recovery study and expressed as the percent recovery of AASs at each concentration level.Percent recovery was assessed by com- paring the peak area from the spiked samples to standard solutions at equivalent concentrations at three diﬀerent concentrations, i.e., 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05 µg.mL-1, by tripli- cate analyses on three diﬀerent days.The results of concen- tration levels for each AAS are summarized in Table 4.4.Discussion A fast, cheap, and simple HPTLC method was developed for the multi-residue analysis of ten anabolic androgenic steroids in sports supplements using the QuEChERS clean- up method.The method was validated based on the ICH guidelines.
This method permits eﬃcient simultaneous analysis of the most prevalent AASs at the concentration level of 60 - 500 ppm with acceptable repeatability , selec- tivity , and sensitivity in the sports supplements. Restani et al.have developed a screening HPTLC method for seven steroids in sports supplements (11).How- ever, their method does not quantify the analytes and is only proper for qualitative detection (11).In another study , Musharraf and Gulzar reported an HPTLC method for determining testosterone derivatives in pharmaceuti- cal formulations (28).However, their sample preparation method could not be used for sports supplements due tothe simplicity of the matrix of their samples.There are other reported methods in which a single steroid has been determined by HPTLC (29).However, in our study , simulta- neous determination of ten AASs has been reported.A few other studies have reported using diﬀerent elu- tion systems to separate steroids on a single HPTLC plate.
However, they have used 2D HPTLC (30) or programmed multiple developments (31, 32). We used three eluting solvent systems to achieve the optimum resolution for separating and identifying AASs on TLC plates.The ex- tract is ﬁrst subjected to the elution by chloroform/acetone (9: 1), separating ﬁve AASs (19-nor androstenedione, 19- nortestosterone, stanozolol, oxymetholone, and oxan- drolone).The other ﬁve AASs (methyl testosterone, closte- bol, trenbolone enanthate, testosterone enanthate, and nandrolone decanoate) appear as two bands in this system.The plate is transferred to another chamber containing ethyl acetate/n-hexane (6.5: 3.5) to separate methyl testos- terone, clostebol, and trenbolone enanthate, or cyclohex- ane/ethyl acetate/methanol (8: 2: 0.5) to separate testos- terone enanthate and nandrolone decanoate.
To the best of our knowledge, the seperstion of nan- drolone decanoate and testosterone enanthate on silica plates using the three elution systems, has not been re- ported anywhere else. The best elution system was a mix- ture of cyclohexane/ethyl acetate/methanol (8: 2: 0.5).To the best of our knowledge, no report has been published on separating these two compounds on silica plates so far.Besides the explicitness of the method, the most im- portant advantage of the HPTLC method for supplement screening is the possibility of running multiple samples (up to 10 samples) in one run.Furthermore, the costs of purchasing and maintaining this device are lower than LC-MS/MS.High-performance thin-layer chromatography is user-friendly and does not require an expert person.Iran J Pharm Res.2022; 21(1):e127444.5 Saadabadi Z et al.Table 4.
