LETTER TO THE EDITOR Role of Glucagon in the Effects of SGLT2 Inhibition on Potassium and MagnesiumHomeostasis To the Editor: We have reported that initiation of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors can dramaticallyimprove severe hypomagnesemia in patients with orwithout diabetes.1,2As noted in a recent review, meta- analyses of randomized clinical trials have reinforcedthat SGLT2 inhibitors decrease the risk of hyperkalemiaand correct hypomagnesemia.3Palmer et al4recently summarized a variety of possible mechanisms to explain the long-term impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on potassium homeostasis.Similarly, we have elaborated on thepossible links to explain the effect of SGLT2 inhibitorson magnesium homeostasis.3However, one must not ignore the potential mechanism that could explain botheffects.SGLT2 inhibitors directly and indirectly increase glucagon levels.
The direct effect is via inhibition of SGLT2 on pancreatic alpha cells, which decreases sodium inﬂux, improves intracellular pH, and increases glucagonsecretion. 5A group of investigators noticed that SGLT2inhibition using dapagliﬂozin mimics the glucagon response of human donor islet cells, similar to the effect of lowering glucose levels.6The indirect effect occurs when the obligatory loss of glucose with SGLT2 in-hibitors shifts metabolism to fatty substrate utilizationvia increased glucagon and decreased insulin levels inpatients with or without diabetes.7Increased glucagon levels can, in turn, increase TRPM6 activity, resulting inincreased magnesium reabsorption in distal convoluted tubule cells.8Similarly, data from animal and human studies suggest a kaliuretic effect of glucagon.9Thus, the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on glucagon could poten-tially explain its effect on potassium and magnesiumhomeostasis ( Fig 1 ).Further studies are necessary to examine this direct link.
