Fish oil (200, 400 or 800 mg/kg body weight), wheat oligopeptide (100, 200 or 400 mg/kg body weight), ﬁshoil + wheat oligopeptide (800 + 100, 400 + 200 or 200 + 400 mg/kg body weight) or the equal volumeof solvent were administered daily by gavage for 10 weeks. The effects of these interventions on natural aging rats were evaluated.Results: All intervention groups had a signiﬁcant increase in muscle mass and grip strength and reduction in perirenal fat weight when compared to the aged control group ( P< 0.05).The results of biochemical parameters, magnetic resonance imaging, proteomics and western blot suggested that the combination https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jare.2023.04.005 2090-1232/ /C2112024 The Authors.Published by Elsevier B.V.on behalf of Cairo University.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).⇑Corresponding author.E-mail address: gjsun@seu.edu.cn (G.Sun).

Additionally, the interventions ameliorated fatty inﬁltration, muscle atrophy, and congestion in the intercellular matrix, and inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration in muscle tissue.The inter-ventions also improved oxidative stress, anabolism, hormone levels, and inﬂammatory levels of skeletal muscle.Conclusions: The combination of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA and wheat oligopeptide was found to be a promising nutritional support to prevent and reverse sarcopenia.
The potential mechanism involvedthe promotion of protein synthesis and muscle regeneration, as well as the enhancement of muscle strength. /C2112024 The Authors.Published by Elsevier B.V.on behalf of Cairo University.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).Introduction The aging of populations, which characterizes the epidemiolog- ical trends of our generation, is an incontrovertible trend in both the developing and the developed worlds [1].Aging causes an imbalance between muscle protein anabolism and catabolism due to a blunted muscle protein synthetic response to protein ingestion [2], thus may contribute to the onset of sarcopenia, an age-related disease characterized by a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength and function [3].
The pathogenesis of sar- copenia involves various potential mechanisms, including intrinsic factors within skeletal muscle and extrinsic factors in systemic environments (e.g., inﬂammation, oxidative stress, endocrine, nutrition, immobility) [3–5] . Sarcopenia was recognized as an independent condition with an International Classiﬁcation of Dis- eases, 10th revision, Clinical Modiﬁcation (ICD-10-CM) code M62.84 by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016 [6], and has recently attracted attention because the aged population increases and sarcopenia complicates many age-related diseases, reduces quality of life, and increases mortality [7].Currently, stan- dard diagnostic criteria of sarcopenia have been established by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) and the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) [8,9] .How- ever, no medications for sarcopenia have been FDA-approved yet[7].
Therefore, it is necessary to develop more effective interven- tion strategies against sarcopenia by combining nondrug therapies with exercise and nutritional intervention [10]. Nutritional support is potentially considered an initial step to delay the progression of muscle loss and enhance physical perfor- mance in older adults, such as a recommended high protein intake [10–12] .However, aging may cause reduced digestive function, declines in mucosal surface area and numerical reduction of the enterocytes in the small intestinal mucosa, resulting in a reduction of nutrients digestibility and utilization [13].Hence, it is important for older adults to consume adequate protein that is easy to digest and absorb.Wheat oligopeptides are a kind of bioactive oligopep- tides hydrolyzed from wheat protein, which have been demon- strated several biological functions including antioxidant, blood lipid reduction and anti-inﬂammation [14].
The main components include glutamine, leucine, proline, tryptophan and serine, which are essential for muscle protein synthesis and maintenance [15– 19]. Our previous study indicated that wheat oligopeptide inter- vention can enhance the protein absorption and utilization and improve gastrointestinal morphology in rats by promoting the growth of epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract and up- regulating the activities of aminopeptidase and Na + -K + -ATPase in small intestinal mucosa [20].As a kind of small-molecule oligopeptide, wheat oligopeptides are easy to digest and absorb, safe to eat for older adults, and were found to enhance the intesti- nal mucosal barrier and have protective effect on small intestine [21–23] .Therefore, wheat oligopeptide supplementation may havethe potential to promote the balance between muscle protein syn- thesis and breakdown, and can be studied if it could be used in the intervention strategies for sarcopenia prevention.
Fish oil-derived x-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), i.e., eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are recommended to be used for improving muscle strength and func- tional capacity as the supplementation with ﬁsh oil has demon- strated potential efﬁcacy for enhancing muscle mass and function in older adults [24–27] . Our previous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial also demonstrated that 6- month supplementation with ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA beneﬁ- cially affected the body composition, muscle strength, physical performance and serum lipid proﬁles in older adults [28].Thus, ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA supplementation could be taken into consid- erations in the endeavor to establish strategies and recommenda- tions to prevent or reverse sarcopenia.Wheat oligopeptide and ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA are different kinds of nutritional substances, thus their functional mechanisms may vary and has potential to elicit a joint effect.
In this study, we established an animal model of aging to explore the effects of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA, wheat oligopeptide and their combined intervention on muscle atrophy and fatty inﬁltration, so as to ﬁnd the optimal intervention scheme and investigate the related mech- anism by proteomics. Given that sarcopenia is a progressive syn-drome characterized by a decline in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function with aging, we aimed to evaluate the poten- tial of nutritional intervention in reversing sarcopenia by address- ing these aspects.Materials and methods Animals and study design One hundred and sixty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats aged 6 months were purchased from Animal Core Facility of Nanjing Medical University (SCXK (Su) 2016–0002), raised with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle, an ambient temperature of 22 ± 2 /C176C and a relative humidity of 50 ± 5% in the Southeast University Laboratory Animal Center (SCXK (Su) 2021–0022).
Rats were given free access to food and drinking water. Of the 160 rats, 150 were raised to 25 months old and used as animal model of aging, and 10 were newly pur- chased and used as young control (YC) group.Based on the previ- ous studies for animal models of sarcopenia, 25-month-old rats are recognized sarcopenia model rats according to Edstrom’s Sarcope- nia Index [29,30] .Of the 150 25-month-old rats, 50 were excluded because of spontaneous tumors or other diseases.Hence, 100 aged rats were randomly divided into 10 groups including aged control group (AC), ﬁsh oil low dose group (FO L), ﬁsh oil median dose group (FO M), ﬁsh oil high dose group (FO H), wheat oligopeptide low dose group (WP L), wheat oligopeptide median dose group (WP M), wheat oligopeptide high dose group (WP H), wheatD.Pan, L.Yang, X.Yang et al.
Journal of Advanced Research 57 (2024) 77–91 78 oligopeptide and ﬁsh oil mixture group 1 (WFM 1), wheat oligopeptide and ﬁsh oil mixture group 2 (WFM 2), and wheat oligopeptide and ﬁsh oil mixture group 3 (WFM 3). Wheat oligopeptide was provided by China National Research Institute of Food & Fermentation Industries (Beijing, China).The preparation, manufacturing process and product properties have been previously described in detail [21,22] .The ﬁsh oil was manu- factured and provided by the Zhanwang Company (Shanghai, China), and 100 g ﬁsh oil contains 70 g EPA + DHA.According to the 2013 Chinese Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) of EPA + DHA for adults is 0.25 /C242 g/d.The low, median and high dosages were equivalent to 10, 20 and 40 times the recommended dosage for a 60 kg adult.There is no DRIs for wheat oligopeptide intake.
Therefore, based on the DRIs, Technical Standards for Test-ing & Assessment of Health Food (2003 edition) and the dosage of wheat oligopeptide used in the previous study [21,22] ,F OL ,F OM and FO H were administered 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg and 800 mg/kg body weight ﬁsh oil via gavage; WP L, WP M and WP H were administered 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight wheat oligopeptide via gavage; WFM 1, WFM 2 and WFM 3 were administered 800 mg/kg + 100 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg + 200 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg + 400 mg/kg body weight ﬁsh oil + wheat oligopep- tide via gavage. The solvent was 0.05% sodium carboxymethyl cel- lulose.YC and AC were administered equal volume of solvent.The intervention time was 10 weeks.Grip strength test After 10-week intervention, grip strength of each rat was eval- uated using a grip strength meter (Shanghai XinRuan Information Technology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China).
Each rat was placed carefully on the grip strength meter and allowed to grasp a trapeze con- nected to a force transducer. Then the rat was pulled back gently by holding its tail with rising force until it lost grip.This measure- ment obtained the peak grip strength force attained.For each rat, the measurement was repeated three times with a two-minute rest between rounds, and the mean value was calculated and recorded.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurement After 10-week intervention, muscle and fat status of rats were examined using a Biospec 7 T/20 USR MRI system (Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany).Rats were anesthetized with 4 mL/kg intraperitoneal injections of 5% chloral hydrate and then main- tained with 1–2% isoﬂurane anesthesia.Rats were placed prone on the track and ﬁxated by medical adhesive tapes.
Each rat was pushed gently into an accurate location of the measuring region.T1-weighted cross-sectional MR images were collected and the maximum cross-sectional area (CSA) of quadriceps femoris was assessed. Measurements and data process including water signal suppression, Fourier transform, Hanning ﬁlter, baseline correction, curve ﬁtting, and phase correction of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, were conducted by ImageJ package.Sample collection On the last day of the experiment, rats were fasted for 12 h, but were allowed to drink water freely.All the rats were sacriﬁced under anesthesia.Their blood samples (via the femoral artery) were centrifuged at 3000 rpm, 4 ℃for 15 min to obtain separated serum samples.After the rats were euthanized, samples of heart, liver, kidney, perirenal fat, quadriceps femoris, gastrocnemius, tib- ialis anterior muscle, metatarsal muscle, subcutaneous fat, and perirenal fat were collected and weighed.
Small pieces of quadri- ceps femoris and perirenal fat were cut and ﬁxed in 4%paraformaldehyde solution. The rest of the tissues were immedi- ately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored in /C080℃ refrigerator.Histopathological analysis Quadriceps femoris and perirenal fat ﬁxed in 4% paraformalde- hyde solution were dehydrated and embedded in parafﬁn.Then parafﬁn sections were cut into slices of 5 lm in thickness and observed using a microscope (Olympus BX41, Tokyo, Japan) after hematoxylin-eosin staining.Myoﬁber CSA of quadriceps femoris was evaluated by ImageJ.Size and number of adipocytes were quantiﬁed at a magniﬁcation of 400 times (number/0.57 mm2/400/C2).
Determination of biochemical parameters in serum and skeletal muscle samples Serum levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipopro- tein cholesterol (LDL-C) were determined based on Beckman Coul- ter UniCel DxC 800 Synchron Clinical Systems (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Muscle-speciﬁc F-box protein Atrogin-1 (Fbox-1), myostatin/growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF-8), muscle speciﬁc ring ﬁnger protein 1 (MuRF-1), myogenic differentiation antigen (MyoD), myogenin (MyoG), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor- b(TGF- b) and tumor necrosis factor- a(TNF- a) in skeletal muscle were determined using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (JRDUN Biotech- nology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) in strict accordance with manu-facturer’s instructions.
Proteomic analysis Proteomic analysis was used to evaluate the differentially expressed proteins in quadriceps femoris samples of FO M, WP M, WFM 2 and AC groups. The process of sample preparation for proteomic analysis included protein extraction, bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, acetone precipitation, redissolve, reduction, alkyla- tion, protein digestion, Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling, SDC cleanup, peptide desalting, and high-pH pre-fractionation.Peptides were then collected, separated, and further analyzed by proteomics-based technologies.The detailed information of NanoLC-MS/MS analysis, MS data analysis and bioinformatics anal- ysis has been described previously [31].The screening criteria for differentially expressed proteins were P-value < 0.05 and fold change < 0.83 or fold change > 1.2.
Western blotting Based on the results of proteomic analysis, differentially expressed candidate proteins were further selected for veriﬁcation of the difference between intervention groups and control groups via western blot analysis. The candidate proteins included adhe- sion protein (Lyric), integrin (Itgav), ﬁbronectin 5 (Fbln5), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial (GPD2), RNA-binding motif protein 3 (Rbm3), protein kinase B (Akt), pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 3 (Pycr3), fatty acid-binding protein (Fabp1), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (Igf- bp1), myosin, proﬁlin-1 (Pfn1), ER lipid raft-associated 1 (Erlin1), sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1), troponin T (Tnnt1).Quadriceps femoris samples were lysed in a RIPA lysis buffer and the concen- tration of protein was determined via the BCA protein assay.TheD.Pan, L.Yang, X.Yang et al.Journal of Advanced Research 57 (2024) 77–91 79 western blot procedures have been described previously [22].
The densities of bands were determined by ImageJ. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).The data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.The difference among groups was eval- uated by one-way ANOVA.Statistical signiﬁcance was considered asPvalue < 0.05.Figures were created by OriginPro 2021 and BioRender ( BioRender.com ).Ethics statement All experiments involving animals were conducted according to the ethical policies and procedures approved by the Ethics Com- mittee on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Southeast University (approval number: SCXK (Su) 2021–0022).Results Effects of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA, wheat oligopeptide and their combination on body weight, grip strength, organ weight and muscle mass of aged rats Changes of body weight and daily amount of food intake of dif- ferent groups during the intervention time are shown in Supple- mentary Figure S1 .
Before the intervention, there was no signiﬁcant difference in body weight between groups of 25- month-old rats, whereas the body weight of 6-month-old YC rats was signiﬁcantly lower than that of other groups. Supplementary Figure S2 shows that after 10-week intervention, the body weight of YC group increased and became signiﬁcantly higher than that of AC group.The body weight of rats in WP M, WP H, WFM 1, WFM 2 and WFM 3 groups were signiﬁcantly higher than that of rats in AC group, whereas their body weight was not signiﬁcantly different from the body weight of YC group.The grip strength of all the intervention groups were signiﬁcantly elevated when compared with AC group.There was no signiﬁcant difference in the weight of heart, liver and kidney between intervention groups and AC group.
The perirenal fat weight of all the intervention groups were signiﬁcantly reduced when compared with AC group, whereas the muscle weight of all the intervention groups were signiﬁcantly ele- vated when compared with AC group. Furthermore, it is likely thatwheat oligopeptide intervention had dose-dependent effect against loss of muscle mass.The combined intervention effect of wheat oligopeptide and ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA on aging- associated muscle loss may be better than that of single intervention.Effects of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA, wheat oligopeptide and their combination on morphology and pathology of skeletal muscle As shown in the MRI results in Fig.1 A, compared with YC group, fatty inﬁltration and muscle atrophy could be established in AC group, while the interventions of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA, wheat oligopeptide and their combination may ameliorate the status to some extent.As shown in Fig.
1 B, the muscle cells of YC group were uniform in size and the myoﬁber CSA of quadriceps femoris was relatively large. However, the result of AC group shows that the myoﬁber CSA decreased dramatically, many lipid droplets were in the muscle tissue, with congestion in the intercellular matrix and inﬁltration of a large number of inﬂammatory cells.After 10- week intervention, the number and size of lipid droplets in muscle tissues of intervention groups were signiﬁcantly reduced, and thecongestion in the intercellular matrix and inﬁltration of inﬂamma- tory cells were alleviated.Fig.1 C and 1D indicate that the maxi- mum CSA and myoﬁber CSA of quadriceps femoris of AC group were signiﬁcantly lower than those of YC group.After 10-week intervention, the maximum CSA and myoﬁber CSA of quadriceps femoris of all the intervention groups apart from FO L group were signiﬁcantly elevated when compared with AC group.
Additionally, there was no difference in both the maximum CSA and the maxi- mum myoﬁber CSA of quadriceps femoris between WFM 2, WFM 3 and YC group. Effects of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA, wheat oligopeptide and their combination on pathology of white adipose tissue and serum lipid levels As shown in Fig.2 A and 2B, at a magniﬁcation of 400 times, the number of white adipocytes decreased and the size of white adipo- cytes increased in AC group when compared with YC group, with congestion in the intercellular matrix and inﬁltration of inﬂamma- tory cells.The interventions of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA, wheat oligopeptide, and especially their combination may alleviate the above status to some extent.Fig.2 C indicates that when compared with AC group, the serum levels of HDL-C and TG of all the inter- vention groups apart from WP L group were signiﬁcantly elevated and decreased, respectively.
The interventions of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA and the combination of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA and wheat oligopeptide signiﬁcantly decreased the serum levels of LDL-C and TC, whereas the intervention of wheat oligopeptide alone may have no impact on them. Effects of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA, wheat oligopeptide and their combination on oxidative stress level, anabolism, hormone level and inﬂammatory level of skeletal muscle Fig.3 A, 3B, 3C and 3E show that the interventions of ﬁsh oil- derived x-3 PUFA, wheat oligopeptide and their combination sig- niﬁcantly improved the biomarkers of oxidative stress, anabolism and inﬂammatory level of skeletal muscle when compared with AC group, and the combined intervention effect of wheat oligopep- tide and ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA especially WFM 2 group on the above biomarkers may be better than that of single intervention.Fig.
3 D shows that the interventions of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA and the combination of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA and wheat oligopeptide signiﬁcantly increased the levels of GH and IGF-1, whereas the intervention of wheat oligopeptide alone had no sig- niﬁcant impact on them. Proteomic analysis of the differences between FO M group and AC group and validation of proteomic results Proteomic results of the differences between FO M group and AC group are shown in Fig.4 .We found 81 signiﬁcant differentially expressed proteins from FO M vs.AC, 54 up-regulated and 27 down-regulated ( Fig.4 A).The majority of the signiﬁcant differen- tially expressed proteins were found to be either increased or decreased and the differential expression patterns of these proteins were visualized via heatmap ( Fig.4 B).
To better elucidate the func- tional diversity of the ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA intervention, we annotated protein functions with currently available databases, including clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COG) and KEGG modules. Based on the distribution of COG functions that matched the differentially expressed proteins, the main COG cate- gories with a known function were involved in ‘‘Cytoskeleton”, ‘‘Signal transduction mechanisms”, ‘‘Posttranslational modiﬁca- tion, protein turnover, chaperones”, ‘‘Lipid transport and metabolism”, and ‘‘Defense mechanisms” ( Fig.4 C).The top 18D.Pan, L.Yang, X.Yang et al.Journal of Advanced Research 57 (2024) 77–91 80 Fig.1.(A) MRI results and (B)pathology of skeletal muscle of each group; (C)maximum CSA, and (D)maximum myoﬁber CSA of quadriceps femoris of each group after 10- week intervention.

The results were consis- tent with those of proteomics. Proteomic analysis of the differences between WP M group and AC group and validation of proteomic results Proteomic results of the differences between WP M group and AC group are shown in Fig.6 .We found 48 signiﬁcant differentially expressed proteins from WP M vs.AC, 32 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated ( Fig.6 A).The differential expression patterns of these proteins were visualized via heatmap ( Fig.6 B).Based on the distribution of COG functions that matched the differentially expressed proteins, the main COG categories with a known func- tion were involved in ‘‘General function prediction only”, ‘‘Signal transduction mechanisms”, ‘‘Transcription”, ‘‘Posttranslational modiﬁcation, protein turnover, chaperones”, ‘‘Secondary metabo- lites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism”, and ‘‘Cytoskeleton” (Fig.6 C).
The top 18 KEGG pathways of differentially expressedproteins in the comparison between WP M group and AC group are shown in Fig. 6 D.Based on the results of proteomic analysis, 9 differentially expressed candidate proteins were further veriﬁed via western blot analysis ( Fig.7 ).The results indicated that compared with YC group, the aging progress signiﬁcantly up-regulated the expression of Lyric and Erlin1, and down-regulated the expression of Rbm3, Pycr3, Pfn1, Akt, p-Akt, QSOX1, Myosin and Tnnt1, while the wheat oligopeptide intervention alleviated the regulation of protein expression caused by aging.Additionally, decreased phosphoryla- tion of Akt protein was found in AC group.Wheat oligopeptide intervention could signiﬁcantly increase the level of Akt phospho- rylation in skeletal muscle of aged rats, and there was no statistical difference between intervention groups and the YC group.The results were consistent with those of proteomics.
Proteomic analysis of the differences between WFM 2 group and AC group and validation of proteomic results Proteomic results of the differences between WFM 2 group and AC group are shown in Fig. 8 .We found 52 signiﬁcant differentially expressed proteins from WFM 2 vs.AC, 34 up-regulated and 18 down-regulated ( Fig.8 A).The differential expression patterns of these proteins were visualized via heatmap ( Fig.8 B).Based on the distribution of COG functions that matched the differentially expressed proteins, the main COG categories with a known func- tion were involved in ‘‘General function prediction only”, ‘‘Signal transduction mechanisms”, ‘‘Cytoskeleton”, ‘‘Nucleotide transport Fig.5.Effect of ﬁsh oil intervention on the protein expression of Itgav, Lyric, Fbln5, Erlin1, QSOX1, GPD2, Tnnt1, Fabp1, Igfbp1, and Myosin in quadriceps f emoris.* P< 0.05 when compared with YC group; # P< 0.05 when compared with AC group.D.Pan, L.Yang, X.Yang et al.

We also found that WFM 2 group had a signiﬁcant higher expression level of Rbm3, Pycr3, Pfn1 and Akt, and a signiﬁcant lower expression level of Fabp1 than WP M or FO M group. There was no signiﬁcant difference between WFM 2 group and YC group in the expression level of Pfn1, Akt, p-Akt and Fabp1.Additionally, the combined interven- tion of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA and wheat oligopeptide could sig- niﬁcantly increase the level of Akt phosphorylation in skeletalmuscle of aged rats, and there was no statistical difference between combined intervention groups and the YC group, whereas the phosphorylation level of combined intervention groups was signiﬁcantly higher than that of single intervention groups, i.e., WP M group and FO M group.The results were consistent with those of proteomics.Discussion Natural aging rats are closely model human muscle and better suited for assessing preventive and therapeutic strategies [30,32] .
Based on the results of muscle mass, grip strength, MRI measure-ment and histopathological analysis, the animal model of aging was successfully established. Overall, our ﬁndings indicated that the interventions involving ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA, wheat oligopeptide and their combination, to varying degrees, improved the muscle performance and skeletal muscle mass, ameliorated the conditions of fatty inﬁltration and muscle atrophy, and reduced body fat and blood lipids level in aged rats, highlighting the poten- tial for reversing sarcopenia.Fish oil-derived x-3 PUFA and wheat oligopeptide had effects on different aspects of some indicators.For example, ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA may have a greater impact on perirenal fat weight, blood lipids, and hormone level, whereas wheat oligopeptide may have a greater impact on body weight, muscle mass, CSA of quadriceps femoris, size and number of adipo- cytes, and inﬂammation.
Additionally, among these intervention strategies, the WFM 2 group (400 mg/kg body weight ﬁsh oil + 2 00 mg/kg body weight wheat oligopeptide) was observed to poten- tially have a relatively better efﬁcacy than other groups. The age-related decline in muscle mass and function is mainly caused by decreased muscle protein anabolism and increased pro-tein catabolism.Proteomic results indicated that consumption of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA could promote protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, biosynthesis of amino acids and glu- tathione metabolism, and inhibit ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis; consumption of wheat oligopeptide could promote protein diges- tion and absorption, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, and regulation of intracellular protein transport; consumption of their combination could further promote peptide transport and negative regulation of proteolysis.
The western blot analysis of differentially expressed candidate proteins were consistent with the results of proteomics.

Speciﬁ- cally, Pfn1 functions in the remodeling of cytoskeleton and the Fig.9.Effect of combined interventions on the protein expression of Rbm3, Pycr3, Pfn1, Akt, p-Akt, QSOX1, Fabp1 and Igfbp1 in quadriceps femoris.* P< 0.05 when compared with YC group; # P< 0.05 when compared with AC group; $ P< 0.05 when compared with WFM 2 group.Fig.10.Diagram of proteins regulated by ﬁsh oil and wheat oligopeptide and their related functions.D.Pan, L.Yang, X.Yang et al.Journal of Advanced Research 57 (2024) 77–91 88 transmission of intracellular signals to regulate myogenic differen- tiation [35]; Pycr3 is highly differentially expressed in skeletal muscle tissues with different anatomies [36].
Both ﬁsh oil- derived x-3 PUFA and wheat oligopeptide interventions down- regulated the levels of Fbox1, MuRF-1 and GDF-8, and up- regulated the expression of Pfn1 and Pycr3 to inhibit skeletal mus- cle atrophy, and activated cAMP signaling pathway, which is essen- tial for controlling and maintaining contractile function and transcriptional homeostasis in skeletal muscle [37]. Previous stud- ies also indicated that animal models deﬁcient in MURF-1 expres- sion exhibit resistance to atrophy [38,39] .It has been reported that muscle size is regulated via a complex interplay of GDF-8 signaling with the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway responsible for increase in protein synthesis in muscle [40], which is also proved in the results of western blotting and proteomics in the present study.GH is ananabolic hormone stimulating whole-body protein accretion with protein synthesis in sites including muscle, which is mediated by IGF-1 and modulated by Igfbp1 [41,42] .
MyoD and MyoG are tran- scription factors with the ability to convert various differentiated cell types to myogenesis, as they play important roles in directing satellite cell function to regenerate skeletal muscle via linking the genetic control of developmental and regenerative myogenesis [43]. Rbm3 is an RNA-binding and cold shock protein whose expression in muscle is associated with extended lifespan and maintenance of protein synthesis [44].Therefore, the interventions of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA and wheat oligopeptide may function in the promotion of protein synthesis and skeletal muscle regener- ation via increasing the levels of GH, IGF-1, MyoD and MyoG, and up-regulating the expression of Akt, Rbm3 and Igfbp1.Tnnt1 and Myosin are potential quantitative biomarkers of muscle function, mass, strength and quality with aging [45,46] .Speciﬁcally, Tnnt1 reﬂects changes of single ﬁber muscle force in the absence of sig- niﬁcant changes in myoﬁber CSA in older adults [45].
Fbln5 is essential for elastic ﬁber formation [47], and Itgav is a transmem- brane adhesion protein responsible for connecting laminin in the extracellular matrix with actin in skeletal muscle ﬁbers, thus trans- mitting longitudinal and lateral forces across the membrane at costameres and myotendious junctions [48]. Hence, combined intervention may enhance skeletal muscle strength by targeting the up-regulation of Tnnt1, Myosin, Fbln5 and Itgav.In addition, aging also affects the quality and function of skele- tal muscle by inﬂuencing the structure, function and distribution of adipose tissue.For example, increased ectopic lipid is a conse- quence of aging.It results in lipid-rich muscle with reduced muscle density and profound negative consequences by increased lipid inﬁltration within muscle ﬁbers and adipocytes between muscle ﬁbers [49].
The changes in adipose tissue function and distribution with aging affect the secretion of adipose tissue derived hormonesand adipokines, and then contribute to a chronic state of low-grade systemic inﬂammation [50]. Our study found that the interven- tions of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA and wheat oligopeptide amelio- rated the state of lipid inﬁltration in muscle, regulated serum lipid levels and inﬂammatory markers, and may function in glycerolipid metabolism, regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, cholesterol meta- bolism, lipid transport and metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and adipocytokine signaling pathway.Additionally, Erlin1 plays roles in binding cholesterol and regulation of lipid metabolism [51], and Fabp1 is involved in the uptake and transport of lipids and the promotion of lipid accumulation [52].Both of them were highly expressed in aged rats, and signiﬁcantly down-regulated by the interventions of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA and wheat oligopeptide.
Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS-related oxidative stress are key mechanisms in skeletal muscle atrophy progression [53]. Mitochondrial functions are impaired with advancing age, including decreased mitochondrial protein synthe-sis and maximal ATP production rate, resulting in reduced muscle performance [54].Dysfunctional mitochondria produce high amounts of ROS and become more susceptible to ROS damage [55].The ability of muscle to handle the increased ROS is impaired with advancing age, leading to the accumulation of ROS and dis- turbed intracellular homeostasis [56].Fragmentation of the mito- chondrial network and increased mitochondrial-derived ROS trigger the activation of the proteasome-ubiquitin system and the autophagy-lysosome axis in myotubes, two key factors con- tributing to muscle atrophy [57,58] .
This study found that the interventions of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA and wheat oligopeptide regulated the oxidative stress reaction by reducing ROS and MDA and activating SOD in muscle, and down-regulated the expression of Lyric, which is involved in promoting autophagy [59]. As shown in Supplementary Table S1, previous studies have pri- marily utilized population-based intervention trials, which have suggested a beneﬁcial effect of ﬁsh oil supplementation on sar- copenia; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.Moreover, animal models have typically employed nor- mal adult animals rather than elderly sarcopenic models, and ﬁsh oil has been added to the feed, which made it difﬁcult to control the amount of intake per animal.
The present study ﬁlls some gaps in the current literature on the mechanisms underlying the beneﬁ- cial effects of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA and wheat oligopeptide on muscle mass and function in the context of sarcopenia and has cer- tain strength and novelty in the ﬁeld. This study utilized a natural aging rat model of sarcopenia and controlled the amount of ﬁsh oil and wheat oligopeptide intake through weight-adjusted gavage.MRI and proteomics were also performed to contribute to the eval- uation of muscle tissue and the mechanistic pathways.Further- more, our study also builds upon the existing body of knowledge and provides new insights into the differences and potential bene- ﬁts of single and combined interventions.Therefore, by addressing the limitations of previous studies and utilizing a more compre- hensive approach, this study provides a more in-depth under- standing of the potential beneﬁts of ﬁsh oil and wheat oligopeptide in combating sarcopenia.
However, the limitation is that whether the results of the animal model can be applied to populations still needs further studies. Conclusion Taken together, the interventions of ﬁsh oil-derived x-3 PUFA, wheat oligopeptide and their combination were found to have pro- tective effects against sarcopenia in aged rats.The WFM 2 group (400 mg/kg body weight ﬁsh oil + 200 mg/kg body weight wheat oligopeptide) was potential to be the optimal intervention strategy among the intervention groups, thus could be considered a promis- ing nutritional support to delay the progression of muscle loss and improve physical performance in older adults.Declarations Compliance with ethics requirements: All experiments involving animals were conducted according to the ethical policies and procedures approved by the Ethics Committee on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Southeast University (approval num- ber: SCXK (Su) 2021–0022).Consent for publication: Not applicable.
