Several independent studies have experimentally demonstrate dpharmaceutical potential ofitsactive Withano- lides, Withaferin A(Wi-A), Withanone (Wi-N) andWithanolide A(Wil-A). However, topro- mote itsuseinherbal industry, anenvironmentally sustainable cultivation andhigh yield are warranted.Inmodern agriculture strategies, there hasbeen indiscriminate useofchemical fertilizers toboost thecrop-yield, however thepractice largely ignored itsadverse effect on thequality ofsoilandtheenvironment.Inview ofthese, weattempted torecruit Vermicom- post (Vcom, 20–100%) asanorganic fertilizer ofchoice during thesowing andgrowing phases ofAshwagandha plants.
Wereport that(i)pre-soaking ofseeds for12hinVermi- compost leachate (Vcom-L) andVermicompost tea(Vcom-T) ledtohigher germination, (ii) binary combination ofpre-soaking ofseeds andcultivation inVcom (upto80%) resulted in further improvement both ingermination andseedling growth, (iii)cultivated plants inthe presence ofVcom+Vcom -Lshowed higher leafandroot mass, earlier onset offlowering andfruiting and(iv)leaves from theVcom+Vcom-L cultivated plants showed higher level of active Withanolides, Withanone (Wi-N), Withanolide A(Wil-A) andWithaferin A(Wi-A) and showed anticancer activities incellculture assays. Taken together, wereport asimple and inexpensive method forimproving theyield andpharmaceutical components ofAshwa- gandha leaves.Introduction Withania somnifera, ahighly reputed plant inAyurveda, hasbeen traditionally used inIndia and itsneighbouring countries asahome remedy and dietary supplement forthousands of years.

Although allparts oftheplant including stem, leaves, roots, flowers, seeds and bark possess these constituents; they particu- larly accumulate inroots and leaves [11]. Recently, ithasbeen shown that ascompared tothe roots, leaves possess higher content ofWithaferin Aand Withanone [12].W.somnifera iscultivated forfood-supplement, herbal and medicine industries.With growing laboratory evidence ofitsmedicinal value foravariety ofailments, sustained supply ofactive ingredient-enric hedplants isdesirable.Inthiscontext, there isaneed forexploring various strategies foritssimple, inexpensive and eco-friendly cultivation.Although, W.somni- fera grows onsandy loam and well-drained soil, itscultivation faces serious challenges dueto lowseed germination and seed viability, along period between planting and harvesting and lowyield [13].Hence, scientific intervention isrequired toenhance seed germination, plant biomass and itspharmaceutically active constituents.
Studies inthepast have reported that pre-treatment ofseeds with KNO 3,/KH 2PO 4/NaNO 3/ PEG improved seed germination ofavariety ofplants [14–16]. Similarly, various mineral nutrients supplemented inthesoilarealso known tohave bearing onplant biomass [17].However, adding synthetic fertilizer toboost plant growth might increase cultivation cost and bring undesirable effects ontheecosystem [18].Furthermore, prolonged useofsynthetic fertil- izers changes microbial diversity and chemical properties ofsoil, causes acidification ofsoil and reduces uptake ofnutrients byplant [19,20].However, fortification ofsoilwith Vermi- compost (Vcom) hasbeen widely accepted asanexcellent organic amendment forcultivation ofseveral important crops [21–23].Vcom isnutrient rich organic material prepared bythe combined action ofearthworms and microorganisms ontheorganic wastes [24].
Itnaturally provides organic nutrients and enormous humic substances aswell asnitrates, phosphates, exchangeable calcium, potassium, sulphur, magnesium and other micronutrients required for plant growth [25]. Itpossesses high porosity, aeration, drainage and water holding capacity [26].Furthermore, Vermicompost leachate (Vcom-L) and Vermicompost tea(Vcom-T), the liquid products ofvermicomposting, containing humified organic matter and nutrients insol- uble form arealso known tohave stimulating effect onseed germination and growth ofplants [27,28].Knowing thefavourable attributes ofVcom and itsliquid products, weaimed toanalyze the effect ofVcom, Vcom-L and Vcom-T onseed germination, growth parameters, onset ofmatu- rity(flowering and fruiting) and itsbearing onwithanolides contents onW.somnifera.Tobest ofourknowledge, there isnoreport onpropagation and evaluation ofimportant phytochemi- calsofahigh valued medicinal plants such asW.somnifera using Vcom and itsassociated products.
The present study proposes ascientifically rational and environmentally sustainable propagation system that could beextended tomany other medicinal plants infuture. Materials and methods Preparation ofVermicompost (Vcom), Vermicompost tea(Vcom-T) and Vermicompost leachate (Vcom-L) Young non clitellateEiseniafetida, collected from thevermifarm ofGuru Nanak Dev University (GNDU), Amritsar (http://www.gndu.ac .in)were used forthepreparation ofVcom, Vcom-T andVcom-L.E.fetida, anepigeic polychaete, iscommonly used forvermicomposting because itishardy, prolific breeder andfeeds onavariety oforganic matter.Vcom wasprepared by Vermicomp ostinAshwagand hacultivation enhances Withanolides PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01943 14 April 16,2018 2/18 processing cattle dung (collected from dairy farms inthevicinity ofGNDU, Amritsar) for45 days inwindrows at27±2˚C temperature and70–80% moisture.
Vcom-L wasprepared from a mixture ofcattle dung, vegetable peels (collected from hostel mess, GNDU, Amritsar) anddry leaflitter (collected from thelawns ofGNDU, Amritsar) intheratio of2:1:1 (w/w) inastainless steel reactor (S1Fig). The leachate wascollected onalternate days fortwomonths andstored at 4˚C.Itwasbrought toroom temperature before use.Forpreparation ofVcom-T, Vcom was mixed indistilled water intheratio of1:10 (w/v).The mixture wasstirred onamagnetic stirrer at40˚C for12handfiltered through filter paper before use.Plant material and treatments Seeds ofW.somnifera were collected from 2-years oldplants (from theexperimental plots at GNDU, Amritsar), washed with distilled water, airdried and divided intwogroups.Before sowing, theseeds were separately given pre-soaking treatments for1h(Group-I) and 12h (Group-II) indistilled water (DW), asaturated solution ofKNO 3(KN), Vcom-L and Vcom-T.
Different percentages ofVcom (0,20,40,60,80and 100%; w/w) were mixed inthepotting mixture which contained 1:1ratio ofsand: loamy soiland used forsubsequent experimenta- tion. The elemental composition ofplant growth substrates wasevaluated using protocol pub- lished earlier [29,30].Germination and plant growth study Experiment wasperformed inacompletely randomised design (CRD), under greenhouse con- ditions with 12hphotoperiod and 25±2˚C temperature (day/night).Twenty seeds from each soaking treatment were sown separately inearthen pots (10-cm diameter containing 160gpot- ting mixture) having variable Vcom (%)inquadruplicate.Thereafter, pots were watered on alternate days tomaintain adequate moisture (50–60%) forgermination and seedling growth.Germination (sprouting ofcotyledonary leaves) wasrecorded after fifteen days ofsowing.
After forty fivedays ofsowing, three seedlings were randomly selected from each replication forrecording shoot length (cm), shoot diameter (cm), root length (cm), leafnumber, root number, and total biomass (g/seedling). Seedlings ofuniform size(with best growth character- istics) were transplanted tolarger earthen pots (25cmdiameter having 2kgprepared potting mixtures) attherate ofoneseedling perpotintriplicate and divided into Vcom (Vcom-L not supplied) and Vcom-L (Vcom+Vcom-L) groups.The plants were irrigated with tapwater on alternate days, Vcom-L group wastreated with 200mlofVcom-L perpot.Growth parameters such asshoot length (cm), shoot diameter (cm), number ofbranches/ plant, number ofleaves/plant and mean leafarea (cm2)were recorded sixty days after trans- plantation, while fresh and dryweight (g/plant) wasdetermined attheend oftheexperiment (seventy fivedays after transplantation).
Formeasuring leafarea, fully expanded young leaves (third and fourth from top) were excised atthebase and immediately digitally photographed (Nikon, Coolpix S2700 camera, Nikon Corp., Japan). Images were then analysed using Ima- geJ1software version 1.4[31].Shoot and root parts oftheplant were separated, washed with water, blotted with filter paper and weighed todetermine thefresh weight.Dry weight was determined after oven-drying theshoot and root at75˚C until aconstant weight wasachieved.During theexperiment, plants were also monitored forthenumber ofdays taken foronset of flowering and fruiting.The experiment wasrepeated twice tovalidate theresults.Preparation ofmethanolic extract ofleaves One gram dryleafpowder from plants grown under theconditions asmentioned wasmixed with 10mlmethanol and sonicated for45min atroom temperature (25± 2˚C).

The residue wasextracted twice with same volume ofmethanol.The pooled filtrate wasthen vacuum-dried onaBȔCHI rotary-evaporator (consisting ofrota vapour R-210, re-circulating chiller B-740, heating bath B-491 and vacuum pump V-7100, BȔCHI Ltd., Flawil Switzerland) at40˚C.Residues were reconstituted inmethanol (10ml), filtered through 0.22μmfilter and used fortheanalysis of Withanolides.High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis Withanolides (Withaferin A:Wi-A, Withanolide A:Wil-A and Withanone: Wi-N) were quan- tified using HPLC (Agilent 1260 infinity series HPLC; Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA), consisting ofQuaternary Pump VL(G1311C) and degasser, standard auto sampler (G1329B ALS) and diode array detector (G1315D DAD VL).
Separations were carried onAgilent ZOR- BAX Eclipse C18 column (4X10mm). Anisocratic elution wascarried outusing water (Sol- vent A)and methanol (Solvent B)intheratio of40:60 (v/v) with aruntime of40min.The injection volume was10μland theeluents were detected at237nm.Calibration curves were prepared from thepurified standards ofWithanolides [Wi-A (LOD =4.086 ng/ml; LOQ =12.38 ng/ml), Wil-A (LOD =5.096 ng/ml; LOQ =15.44 ng/ml) and Wi-N (LOD =1.722 ng/ml; LOQ =5.742 ng/ml] and theresults were expressed inmg/g dryweight ofthesample.Preparation of β-cyclodextrin-assist edwater extract ofAshwagandha leaves Water extract (10% w/v) wasprepared from dried powder ofleaves grown under different con- ditions asindicated.Forcyclodextrin (CD)-assisted aqueous extraction, thedried leafpowder (10% w/v) wasmixed with aqueous solution of β-CD (2%).The mixture wasstirred for24hat 37˚C with slow shaking (90rpm) inTAITEC Bio-Shaker BR-43FL.
The slurry wascentrifuged at3500 rpm for10min and thesupernatant wasfiltered through 0.45-micron filter. The filtrate wascalled β-CD extract.The precipitate wasdissolved inDMSO asdescribed [12] and called β-DM extract.CDand DM extracts obtained from dryleafpowder (10% byweight) were con- sidered 100% and added tothecellculture medium inarange of0.05~1%, corresponding to 50μg—1 mg/ml ofdried leafpowder.Invitro cytotoxicity assay Human normal fibroblasts (TIG-3) were procured from Health Science Research Resources Bank, Japan.Osteosarcoma (U2OS) celllines were obtained from DSPharma, Japan, and cul- tured inDulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium DMEM (Invitrogen)-supplemente dwith 10% fetal bovine serum inahumidified incubator (37˚C and 5%CO 2).Cells were cultured at40– 60% confluency and treated with different kinds ofextracts asindicated.
Cells were incubated at37˚C for36–48 h,following which cytotoxicity wasestimated byMTT {3-(4,5-dimethylthia- zol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide} assay (Life Technologies) asdescribed earlier [5]. Statistical analyses Experimental data were subjected totwo-way ANalysis ofVAriance (ANOVA) testtoanalyze thecorrelation within Vcom and pre-soaking groups and thedifference between means ofdif- ferent Vcom proportions (%;taking untreated 0%group ascontrol) and pre-soaking treat- ments wascompared byTukey’s HSD atp0.05 (5% level ofsignificance) using SigmaStat version 3.5(SystatSoftware Inc.).

This value was significantly higher (p0.001) than allother pre-soaking groups (KN, Vcom-L and Vcom-T). Furthermore, toanalyse thepromotive effect ofVcom and Vcom-L, weperformed element analysis.Itwasobserved that sand: soilpossessed C-1.14%, N-0.39%, P-0.03 g/kg and K-3.63 g/kg; Vcom contained C-12.47%, N-0.55%, P-0.16 g/kg and K-6.85 g/kg, and Vcom-L com- prised C-0.03%, N-0.37%, P-0.24 mg/L and K-631.2 mg/L.Forty fivedays-old seedlings were examined formorphological parameters.Asshown in Figs 1and 2,12hpre-soaking forallthe4groups resulted inbetter growth than 1hpre-soak- inggroup.Wefound that theseeds pre-soaked inDW (1h)and sowed incontrol (0% Vcom) resulted inshortest shoot length (0.88±0.08 cm) and thissteadily increased (p0.001) for seeds sowed inVcom-supplement edsoil(Fig 1C).Maximum shoot length (9.53±0.55 cm) was observed with 80% Vcom forVcom-L soaked seeds from 1hgroup.
Comparison ofshoot diameter (cm) incontrol revealed that thepre-soaking inVcom-T resulted inthicker shoots (0.33±0.01) (Fig 1D). Furthermore, acombination ofVcom-T pre-soaking (12h)and 80% Vcom caused maximum increase indiameter (0.47±0.01), which differed significantly (p<0.001) from DW and KNpre-soaking (Fig 1D).Examination ofroot length (cm) incontrol showed that thelongest roots (8.55±0.31) were present inVcom-T pre-soaked group (Fig 1E).Vcom supplementation resulted inafurther increase inroot length.Maximum length (9.13±0.49) wasobtained inVcom-T pre-soaked and 40% Vcom sowed group.Root number/seedling showed highest increase with KN(17.25 ±0.62) pre-soaking, incontrol (0% Vcom).Asignificant (p0.001) increase wasobserved after Vcom supplementation.Maximum increase wasrecorded inVcom-L pre-soaked, 80% Vcom plants (32.0±0.59), which was53% more than control (Fig 2A).Leaf number/seedling in Fig2.Effect ofpre-soaki ngonW.somnifera vegetation and biomass.

DW, Vcom-L and Vcom-T pre-soaked seeds sowed in100% Vcom gave similar, although slightly lesspronounced results (Fig 3C). Number ofbranches/plants showed astrong improvement upto60% Vcom irrespective of various pre-soaking treatments (Fig 3D).Plants in0%Vcom didnotshow branching while Vcom-T induced branching even inthisgroup.Vcom supplementation caused increase in branching inaconcentration dependent manner (maximum with 60%).Vcom-L application caused afurther increase inbranching/plant (Fig 3D).Maximum number ofbranches reach- ingavalue of72% more than control (p0.001) wasrecorded forVcom-L pre-soaked, 100% Vcom+Vcom-L plants (8.33±0.56).This value wassignificantly higher than DW, KNand Vcom-T pre-soaked groups (Fig 3D).Incontrol (0% Vcom), leafnumber/plant washighest inVcom-L (15.0±0.63) pre-soaked group (Fig 4A).Incomparison tocontrol, Vcom supplementation caused asignificant (p0.001) increase inleafnumber regardless ofpre-soaking treatments (Fig 4A).
Highest increase (93% over control) wasrecorded forDW pre-soaked (91.67±1.12) and 40% Vcom plants. This value wassignificantly different from Vcom-L and Vcom-T groups.Strong effect ofVcom-L treatment wasevident till100% Vcom, where theleafnumber forallthepre-soak- ings wassignificantly more than control plants (p<0.001) (Fig 4A).In0%Vcom plants, leafarea (cm2)washighest inVcom-T (15.74±0.05) pre-soaked group (Fig 4B).Vcom-L treatment caused 2–3fold increase intheleafarea (7.83±0.03–36.82±0.15).Vcom inthepotting mixtures caused asignificant increase inleafarea (p0.001).Binary com- bination ofVcom (upto40%) and Vcom-L caused more enhancements inleafarea irrespec- tiveofpre-soaking treatments (Fig 4Band 4C).Largest increase of77% over control was recorded forKNpre-soaked, 20% Vcom+Vcom-L plants (58.28±0.24).This value wassignifi- cantly higher than thevalues obtained forDW, Vcom-L and Vcom-T pre-soaked plants.
Higher proportions (60–100%) ofVcom caused slight reduction inleafarea (Fig 4C). Fresh and dryweight (shoot and root/plant) ofseventy fivedays oldplants asrepresented inFig5A–5D, showed that in0%Vcom group, Vcom-T pre-soaking wasbetter (4.86±0.59) forfresh shoot weight (g).With Vcom supplementation, fresh shoot weight showed adose dependent increase (p0.001) irrespective ofvarious pre-soaking treatments.Vcom-L treat- ment ofplants resulted infurther improvement infresh shoot weight and maximum increase Vermicomp ostinAshwagand hacultivation enhances Withanolides PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01943 14 April 16,2018 7/18 (94% over control) wasobserved forVcom-T (85.71±4.02) pre-soaked 100% Vcom grown plants (Fig 5A).This value wassignificantly higher than DW and Vcom-L pre-soaked groups.Dry shoot weight (g)washighest inVcom-L (0.83±0.05) pre-soaked, 0%Vcom grown plants (Fig 5A).

Although alarge variety ofsecondary metabolites includ- ingWithanolides have been detected inWithania somnifera extracts, most bioactivities have been ascribed tobioactive Withanolides, Wi-A, Wi-N and Wil-A.Wefocused onWi-A and Wi-N that have been reported topossess considerable anticancer activity.Whereas Wi-A has been shown tocause strong cytotoxicity tocancer and normal cells, Wi-N wasmild butsafe fornormal cells [5–7, 12,13,25].Wehave earlier reported theprotocols toobtain Withano- lides inwater extract using alpha, beta and gamma cyclodextrins.Beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD) extracts showed higher concentration ofboth Wi-N and Wi-A [12].Wi-N, being hydrophobic, remained insoluble and wasfound inthepellet.
Twelve samples ofleaves raised under different conditions (Fig 6B)were extracted using β-cyclodextrin.

Both β-CD and β-DM extracts were examined fortheir anticancer bioactives byestablished viability assays.Inagreement with ourearlier study [12], wefound that the0.05% β-CD extracts were cytotoxic tohuman cancer cells suggesting that theleaves contained thebioactive withanolides (Wi-N and Wi-A).Furthermore, they also showed equivalent cytotoxicity tohuman normal cells (Fig 6B).The latter wasattributed tothepresence ofWi-A inthese extracts.The β-DM extracts that possessed high ratio ofWi-N showed somewhat higher toxicity tohuman cancer cells ascompared tothenormal cells (Fig 6C).
These data suggested that theplants raised in thepresent study aresuitable fortheir useinanticancer and other benefits that have been ascribed toactive Withanolides. Discussion The present study investigated thepotential role ofVcom and itsliquid preparations (Vcom-L and Vcom-T) onseed germination, growth and yield ofW.somnifera.Germination and seed- ling emergence aretwocritical phases forestablishment ofacrop, which along with aninternal regulation areaffected byexternal factors liketemperature, moisture, presence orabsence of hormonal stimulators and inhibitors.Pre-soaking ofseeds hasbeen known tostimulate meta- bolic activities, soften hard seed coat, leaching ofchemical inhibitors ofgermination and ensure rapid and uniform germination [14–16].Inthepresent study, pre-soaking for12h appeared toremarkably influence germination and growth ofW.somnifera seedlings that fur- ther improved with supplementation ofVcom togrowth mixtures.
These results areinconfor- mity with other studies that documented stimulatory action ofpre-soaking [32] and Vcom application onseed germination and growth ofseedlings ofpeppers and petunias [33, 34]. Pos- itive influence ofVcom-L and Vcom-T pre-soaking onthemorphology ofseedlings inthe present work issupported byearlier findings inpeaand tomato seedlings [27,35].Vcom enriches thesoilwith polysaccharides that actascementing substance toenhance aggregate stability forbetter aeration, water retention, drainage, aerobic condition ofsoiland nutrientTable 1.Effect ofpre-soakin g,Vcom and Vcom-L application onthecontent ofWithaferin A,Withanolid eAand Withan one inleaves ofW.somnifera.Vcom conc.

Additionally thehumic substances pres- entinVcom activate enzymes fornitrate metabolism, organogenesis and plant growth [37].Furthermore, ourstudy showed that thedifferent morphological parameters ofseedlings responded differentially todifferent proportions ofVcom.Maximum increase formost ofthe parameters wasobserved upto 80% Vcom, 100% Vcom however didnotcause further stimula- tion ofgermination and seedling growth, rather alltheparameters showed adecrease inthis mixture.Itisconsistent with other reports that have demonstrated that growth and yield of plants decreased when more than 60% Vcom wasincorporated into thegrowth mixtures [38– 40].
These studies correlated decrease ingermination and growth ofseedlings tohigh concen- tration ofsalts and phenolic substances athigher concentrations ofVcom. Vcom-L wasused asanadditional supplement along with Vcom toenhance thegrowth of W.somnifera atlater stages ofitsdevelopment.Ithasbeen suggested that Vcom-L haspoten- tialtoactasagrowth stimulator when used asasoildrench orfoliar spray [41].Interestingly, ourresults also indicated anadditional enhancement inplant growth under thecombined effect ofVcom and Vcom-L.Regardless ofpre-soaking, growth and yield ofthisplant showed evident increase with increasing percent (upto60%) content ofVcom inthepotting mixture.Forinstance, 40–60% Vcom wasbetter forshoot length and 20–60% Vcom wasbeneficial in improving leafnumber and leafarea.
Moreover, maximum increase inleafnumber (14-fold more than control) and leafarea (4-fold more than control) inourstudy under theinfluence ofthebinary combination ofVcom+Vcom-L indicated more biomass accumulation, very important tobridge thegapbetween demand and supply ofW.somnifera. These results arein linewith arecent finding onthree medicinal plants i.e.Eucomisautumnalis, Tulbaghialudwigi- anaandTulbaghiaviolacea, where anincrease inleafnumber and leafsizehasbeen reported with theapplication ofVcom-L [42].Similarly, shoot weight (fresh and dry) isanindicator of total biomass allocated totheaerial parts ofaplant, therefore enhancement ofshoot diameter and number ofbranches inthepresent work canbelinked toaconcomitant highest increase inplant biomass in100% Vcom.Furthermore, growth ofaplant could beassigned toitseffi- cient root system.Asteady increase inroot growth wasobserved with percentage ofVcom in ourstudy.
Similar results have been reported fortomato and olive plants with incorporation of Vcom [43] and humic acids extracted from Vcom [44]. Wealso observed asignificant enhancement inroot growth intheform ofdryweight after Vcom-L application.Enhance- ment ofgrowth parameters ofW.somnifera with thisbinary combination canbeattributed to increase inphytoassimilable nutrients, porosity and moisture retention with theconcentration ofVcom inthepotting mixtures and higher content ofsoluble/exchangeabl enutrients in Vcom-L.The humic substances present inVcom have been reported toactivate ionchannels (H+-ATPase) present ontheroot plasma membrane and stimulate differentiation ofsites of lateral root emergence [45, 46].Such aneffect ofhumic substances could becorrelated to enhancement ofnutrient uptake bytheplant [47, 48].Hence, improvement intheroot system under thecombined effect ofVcom and Vcom-L may have enabled theplant tooptimally exploit theavailable resources foritsgrowth and development.
Another possible reason fortheobserved enhancement ofgrowth and yield ofW.somnifera may betheoccurrence ofsome bio-stimulants and plant growth regulators ofmicrobial origin inVcom and itsliquid preparations. These might have promoted aseries ofsignalling events that affected plant metabolism likecellrespiration, photosynthesis, protein synthesis and other enzymatic reactions assuggested inother studies [49–51].Recently, presence ofcytokinins, auxins, abscisic acid, gibberellins, brassinosteroids and phenolic compounds hasbeen con- firmed ingarden waste derived Vcom-L [52].Moreover, hormonal nature ofVcom-derived humic acids hasbeen reported duetosimilarity intheir action toplant growth regulators such asIAA [53].
This suggests thepossibility that these hormones may beattached tohumic acid Vermicomp ostinAshwagand hacultivation enhances Withanolides PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01943 14 April 16,2018 13/18 molecules and thereby directly influences development ofaplant when agrowth mixture is supplemented with Vcom and Vcom-L [54]. Ofnote, wealso found that 60% Vcom cultivated plants showed earlier onset offlowering and fruiting while 80% and 100% Vcom resulted inaslight delay (~1week) inonset offlower- ingaswell asfruiting (Fig 3).The data issupported bythefindings ofSangwan etal.[55] who reported reduction inthetime offlowering (by90days over control) ofMarigold at30% and 40%, with maximum number offlowers at30% vermicompost.The binary combination of Vcom and Vcom-L, however, induced flowering and fruiting in80% and 100% Vcom at almost thesame time tothat of60% Vcom plants inourstudy.
Molecular mechanism(s) of such aneffect ofVcom and Vcom-L ontheflowering and fruiting warrants further studies. Improvement ingrowth ofW.somnifera, inthepresent study, isdirectly related tothesig- nificant riseinthecontents ofWithanolides under thecombined effect ofVcom+Vcom-L.This wasfurther confirmed through cytotoxicity assays using human cancer and normal cells.Asexpected, β-cyclodextrin assisted extracts, β-CD and β-DM [12] showed cytotoxicity inthe range of0.05~0.1% inculture medium.Furthermore, leafextracts from plants raised under conditions, such aspre-soaking inVcom-L and treated with combined Vcom (upto60%) +Vcom-L showed good anticancer activity.Ontheother hand, leafextracts from plants treated with 100% Vcom +Vcom-L showed lowactivity suggesting that they didnotpossess active Withanolides (Fig 6Band 6C).The result wasendorsed bydata from both 1-CD and β-DM extracts.
Furthermore, β-CD extracts showed equivalent cytotoxicity tohuman cancer and normal cells (Fig 6B), the β-DM extracts were more cytotoxic tocancer cells (Fig 6C). The data wasinagreement with theexpected higher content ofWi-A in β-CD extract and Wi-N in β-DM extract [5,12].Since experimental evidence ofvarious activities intheleaves ofW.som- nifera and active Withanolides (Wi-A and Wi-N) hasbeen rapidly accumulating, thecurrent results describing theuseofVcom forincreasing their biomass and bioactive content are important toenhance itsmedicinal value.Conclusions Pre-soaking inVcom-L and Vcom-T for12hisrecommended asanalternative tothechemi- caltreatments toimprove seed germination and seedling establishment ofW.somnifera.Addi- tion of60% Vcom inthesoilboosted germination, growth and yield oftheplant, and also shortened thetime toobtain reproductively mature plants.
Vcom-L application effectively enhanced thegrowth, yield and bioactive compounds intheplants when used incombination with Vcom.
