Tis randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efcacy of a supplement containing hydrolysed collagen and vitamin C (Absolute Collagen, AC) on biophysicalparametersandvisiblesignsofagingforskin,scalp,andhair,whentakendailyorevery48hours. Methods.Wemeasureddermal collagenusingconfocalmicroscopyandhigh-resolutionultrasound.Hydration,elasticity,wrinkles,andclinicaltrichoscopyweremeasuredinparalleltoexpertvisualgrading.Efcacymeasureswererecordedatbaseline,week6,andweek12.Results.Following 12weeks daily use of the AC supplement, using confocal microscopy, we observed a signifcant 44.6% decrease in fragmentationvs.placebo (p<0.01).Wealso measureda changeinthe ultrasound LEP(low echogenic pixel)ratio comparing upperandlower dermis (−9.24 vs.
−7.83, respectively, p�0.05), suggesting collagen improvements occurred more in the upper dermal com- partment.After12weeksvs.placebo,skinhydrationwasincreasedby13.8%(p <0.01),R2elasticityindexwasincreasedby22.7% (p<0.01), and Rz proflometry index was decreased by 19.6% (p <0.01). Trichoscopy showed an average 11.0% improvement in scalp scaling and a 27.6% increase in the total number of hairs counted vs.placebo (p �n.s.).Tis was associated with a 31.9% increase in clinical grading score for hair healthy appearance (p <0.01).Conclusion.Te AC supplement has shown clinical benefts for skin, scalp, and hair, when used either daily or every 48hours, over a 12-week period.1.Introduction Collagen is the most abundant protein in the skin, but its importance runs much deeper than this simple fact.
Asa protein, collagen is uniquely made for strength (structuralrigidityimpartedbyproline),stability(constructionoftriplehelices), and resilience imparted by extensive crosslinking[1,2].Teformationofdensefbrousnetworksispivotalforproduction of an extracellular matrix scafold with hightensile strength for the skin [3]. Collagen, by way of interaction with elastin and gly- cosaminoglycannetworks,contributestoelasticity,frmness,and skin hydration.Collagen production declines with ageand is driven by intrinsic factors (e.g., genetics, hormonalfuxes,andmetabolicdysfunction)andextrinsicfactors(e.g., UV-radiation,pollution,andsmoking)[4].Intheagingskin, theabilitytoreplenishcollagennaturallydecreasesbyabout1.0% per year [5].Tis decrease in collagen has been linkedto the appearance of fne lines and deeper wrinkles.
Stimulation of collagen production and/or inhibition of collagen degradation can be achieved via the use of oralsupplements, designed to deliver skin benefts and oftenreferred to as “nutricosmetics.” Supplements containinghydrolysed collagen (HC) are reported to fght the signs ofthe aging process, contributing to a youthful and healthyappearance. When consumed, HC is further hydrolysed toWiley Dermatology Research and Practice Volume 2024, Article ID 8752787, 12 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/8752787 amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides.Due to the very high content of hydroxyproline, proline, and glycine incollagen, the resultant peptide species are unique and willnot be typically found in other protein sources (e.g., milkand plant-based or fermentation-based vegan equivalents)[6].Tese peptides appear in the bloodstream and skin following ingestion and are ligands proven to stimulate f- broblasts to synthesise new collagen proteins [7, 8].
Te HC should be combined with vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid) which, in addition to its role as an antioxidant, cansupportthesynthesisofthecollagentriple-helixproteinandthe assembly of collagen into fbres. Te importance of l-ascorbic acid is reliant on its use as a cofactor in hydrox-ylation of proline residues in procollagen (which stabilisesthe triple-helix structure) and lysine residues (which areused to cross-link fbres) [9, 10].As an antioxidant, l-ascorbic acid can interact with a range of free-radical spe- ciestofacilitatetheirneutralisation.Tisisakeymechanism bywhichthe skinisprotectedfromfree-radicaldamagedueto UV-radiation and infammaging [11].Tere have been several reviews of published rando- mised clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the efcacy of HC-based supplements.A review by Choi et al.carried outasystematic reviewof11studies,witha totalof805 subjectsusingoralcollagensupplementation,andshowedsignifcantbenefts on skin elasticity, hydration, and collagen density[12].
Al-Atif summarised the fndings from 12 RCTs thatdemonstrated improved skin elasticity, turgor, hydration,and reduced skin wrinkling and roughness [13]. Pu et al.reported on 26 RCTs assessing the efcacy of the product testedinatotalof1721subjectsandreportedbeneftsofskinhydration and elasticity [14].Te variability of doses, agerange,numberofweekstested,andskinmeasuresdoeslittleto support the robustness of the clinical reports.However,thereisageneralpatternsuggestingthatHCisefcaciousasan antiaging treatment for women who use the supplementfor up to 12weeks [15, 16].Te conclusion of these sys-tematic reviews and meta-analysis is that HC supplemen-tation can improve skin hydration, elasticity, and wrinkles.Whilst the clinical benefts of HC for the skin are well- documented, many of the trials are lacking in a detailedanalysis of skin structures such as collagen and therefore donot support the link between the proposed mechanism ofcollagen production and the putative skin benefts.
Tere isalsoa lack ofvalidated trichologicalassessmentsof thescalpand hair, which ideally should be carried out on the samecohort, in the same clinical trial. Te use of HC supplements for consumers who wish to beneft from improved skin and hair quality, coupled withtheproposedabilitytofghtthesignsofaging,hasincreasedrapidly in the last several years.Tere is a need for larger trials with more technical and clinical measures to support this antiaging approach.We have conducted a clinical trial showing the skin, scalp, and hair benefts of the AC supplement, when useddaily, or every 48hours, and tested against a placebo.To thebestofourknowledge,thisisthefrstreportoftheefcacyofcollagen peptides to improve the skin,scalp, and hair,in thesamecohort.Forthefrsttime,wehaveusedhigh-resolutionultrasound images to show that there are diferential efectsfollowing 12weeks use of the supplement, with increasedcollagen content in the upper (papillary) dermis comparedto the lower (reticular) dermis.
Finally, we report the dose regimen is critical to ensure maximal clinical efcacy, with daily use being far superior to use every 48hours. 2.Methods 2.1.Study Design.Tis study was a randomised, placebo- controlled, double-blind design following the principles ofGood Clinical Practice.Te protocol was approved by anindependent Ethics Committee (signed by the chairman ofthe East Anglia Ethics Committee on 09.01.2023).A writtendeclaration of informed consent was received from allparticipants.Te study conformed to the requirements of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.2.2.Subjects.A total of 140 male and female participants (aged 40–60years) were enrolled in this study, with 130 participants completing the 12-week trial (Figure 1).Te inclusion criteria included visible signs of aging, requiring a minimum Glogau Wrinkle Score of 2 and a hyperpig-mentation score of 4.Fitzpatrick skin types I–VI wererecruited,andthesplitbetweengenderswas90%femaleand10% male.
Menopausal status was recorded for the femalecohort. Exclusion criteria included current skin disease onthe face or scalp, allergy or intolerance to test product,aesthetic skin surgery (including Botox), and medicationssuch as anti-infammatory drugs applied directly to the testarea (face/scalp).2.3.Test Products.AC is a skincare supplement containing 8000mg of hydrolysed collagen, sourced from a sustainable marine supply.Te supplement also contains 60mg l-ascorbic acid (75% NRV).A placebo product was manu-factured to match the organoleptic properties of the AC supplement, including taste, texture, colour, and viscosity.For blinding of the clinical trial, both products were presented in a plain white sachet, with only an assigned product code to identify each batch.Te sachets wereidentical in appearance and labelled according to theICH-GCP requirements.Subjects were instructed to take 1sachet per day, or 1 sachet every 48hours, preferably in themorning, on an empty stomach.
Personnel who were notinvolvedinanyotheraspectofthestudyweretaskedtolabelthe investigational product. Te investigators, statistician,other site personnel, and participants were blinded to the product or placebo.Te unblinding of the clinical trial only occurred after the data were analysed and reported usingcoded identifers (participant numbers) and coded parallelarm identifers (groups 1–4, representing AC or placebotaken daily and AC or placebo taken every 48hours).Ahome use diary was used for compliance checks.2 DermatologyResearchandPractice 2.4.Measurement Conditions.Subjects equilibrated in a controlled environment (at a temperature of 20°C and at a relative humidity of 25–40%) for at least 15minutes prior to any assessments being performed.Measurements weretaken on the infraorbital region (below the eye socket) forthe corneometer and cutometer and on the lateral canthallines (crow’s feet area) for the confocal microscopy, ultra- sound, and proflometry.2.5.ConfocalMicroscopy.
Tecollagenstructure,specifcally the quality, density, and fragmentation in the papillary and superfcial dermis, was visualised using a confocal laserscanning microscope (VivaScope ®1500; GmbH, Munich, Germany). Te 3D stereoscopic images allow the cellularmicrostructuretobevisualisedviaopticalcrosssectionswitha horizontal resolution of up to 1.25 μm and vertical reso- lution of 3–5 μm.Tis can be used to target a depth of the superfcial dermis of ∼200μm.Approximately 40 individual images were acquired at 5 μm interval scanning steps to create a stereoscopic stack.Only the images targeting the collagen network in the papillary and superfcial dermis of the lateral canthus (crow’s feet area) of the face were ana-lysed.Imagestakenatbaselinewerecomparedtothosetakenat week 6 and week 12.Te images for each were graded forcollagen structure by an expert grader, based on evaluationof a blinded set of confocal images.
Collagen density,structure, and fragmentation are based on a compositescoringsystemusingaVisualAnalogScale(VAS).AscanbeseeninFigure2,ascoreof0representshighdensitycollagen,clear evidence of collagen structure, and with no visiblefragmentation. A score of 9 represents low density collagen,lack of structured collagen fbres, and clearly visiblefragmentation.2.6.Ultrasound.Te ultrasonographic evaluation was per- formed at baseline, week 6, and week 12, at the lateral canthus area of the right side of the face (crow’s feet area).Te Dermascan-C device (Cortex Technologies, Aalborg,Denmark)isequippedwitha20MHztransducerthatallowssectionalskinimagesuptoadepthof2.5cm.Tetransducerwas applied perpendicularly on the skin, and the gain curvewasadjustedatavalueof20dBandavelocityofpropagatedsound wave of 1580m/s.Te obtained images were pro-cessed with image analysis software provided by Dermavi-sion, Cortex Technology.
Te Dermavision software usedpixel amplitude corresponding to a numerical scale set between 0 and 255. Te 0–30 interval corresponds to low echogenic pixels (LEPs, collagen degeneration), the 50–150interval to medium echogenic pixels (MEPs, collagen andelastin), and the 200–255 interval to high echogenic pixels(HEPs, collagen and elastin).

Skin Hydration. Skin hydration measurements were performed using the Corneometer ®CM825 (Courage and Khazaka, Germany) at baseline, week 6, and week 12.Tis instrument relies on the dielectric constant of water.Anychange in the dielectric constant due to skin moisturevariationswillalterthe capacitanceoftheinstrument.Tesevariations are detected electronically and are converted into a value represented as arbitrary units.2.8.Elasticity.Te viscoelastic properties of the skin (elas- ticity and frmness) were performed using the Cutometer ®MPA 580 (Courage and Khazaka, Germany) at baseline, week6,andweek12.Temeasuringprincipleisbasedonthesuction method, in which negative pressure is created in the device and the skin is drawn into the aperture of the probe.Te measurements for deformation, passive stretch, andrecoil were recorded.
For each measurement, a constantsuctionof400mbarwasappliedforfveseconds,followedbya relaxation time of 3seconds, measured in triplicate.Elasticity is defned as the skin resistance to mechanicalsuction force (Ua) vs. its ability to recover after release (Uf)where R2 �Ua/Uf.2.9.ProflometricAnalysis.A skin surface replica was taken of the crow’s feet area of the left side of the face at baseline,week 6, and week 12.A negative replica of the wrinkles onthe cutaneous surface of the crow’s feet area was obtainedusingSilfo ®(JSDavis,Hart)material.Proflometricanalysis was carried out using the OPTIMAS v6.5 in combinationwith StatSoft STATISTICA 7.Luminance was measuredalong a set of 10 equal length parallel lines (passes) runningacross the replica parallel to the lighting direction.
Te variations in luminance were treated as indicative of the roughness and analysed by traditional surface roughnessstatistics,withRzreportingtheaveragemaximumdiferenceintheluminancevalueforfveequallengthsegmentsineachofthe10linestraversingthesample.TeISOdefnitionofRz(ten-pointheightofirregularities)istheaveragevalueoftheabsolute values of the heights of fve highest profle peaksand the depths of fve deepest valleys within the evaluationlength. A reduction in the Rz index is indicative of a re-duction in fne lines and wrinkles at the crow’s feet area.2.10.Skin Visual Grading.Te Glogau Scale is a validated dermatological tool evaluating skin photoaging, includingwrinkles, pigmentation, keratosis, and other skin imper-fections.Expert clinical staf applied this 4-point VAS toparticipants viewed under standardized lighting conditions.Grade 1 corresponds to mild damage to the skin, whereas Grade 4 corresponds to severe photoaging.
Expert visualassessors also graded subjects according to evenness of skintone. A 9-point VAS (where 0 �even skin tone and 9 �very uneven skin tone) was used to follow the putative efects ofthe AC supplement to improve skin characteristics whencompared to a placebo.2.11.Trichoscopy.Te DinoLite Pro Polarising Trichoscope (Dinolite, the Netherlands) was used to capture images of thehairandscalp.Foreachsubject,3areasofthescalpweremeasured, specifcally the front, mid, and back of the scalpalong a central parting to allow capture of high-resolutionimages.Te images were loaded into analytical softwareTrichoScience Pro V 1.7 for measurement and datarecording.Te centre section of the scalp was chosen as the measurement area, with measures taken at 4cm intervalsfrom the hairline to the crown, to assess the scalp conditionand the total hair count.
Tis was carried out at the start ofthetrialandrepeatedattheendofthestudyat12weeks.Tekey measurements for the scalp were infammation andscaling,andforhair,wemeasuredtheaveragetotalhairsperunit area. Scalp infammation was measured on a 5-point VAS, whereascoreof1representsinfammationmeasuredatall3test sites and a score of 5 represents normal, healthy, uninfamed scalp.Scalp scaling was measured on a 5-point VAS, where a score of 1 represents scaling that covers morethan30%ofall3testsitesandascoreof5representsnormal,healthy scalp with no visible fakes.Te TrichoScience ProV1.7 is set to automatically count the total hairs per unitarea, and this assessment is carried out for each of the 3 testsites and then averaged.Data are presented as number ofhairs per unit area (cm 2).2.12.Hair Visual Grading.Expert visual grading of hair healthy appearance was conducted at baseline, week 6, andweek 12.
Assessments were made with the aid of a 60-Wattpearlbulb,withdistancemaintainedatapproximately30cmfromthetestsite.Hairhealthyappearancewasmeasuredona 5-point VAS, where a score of 0 represents maximum PCR Clinical Grading Scale DescriptorsType of Grading01 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Collagen fragmentation, density and structure.Visual from image High density collagen.

Te sample size calcu- lationwasbasedontheprimaryobjectiveofthecomparison of12-weekskinconfocalfragmentationchangesbetweenthetreatment and placebo groups. With an estimated 80%power, 5% signifcance, and 10% attrition, 100 participantswere required (n �50 per group).Tis calculation assumed variability of confocal density and fragmentation data basedon an earlier clinical trial [17].For proflometry Rz, cutometer R2, corneometer, and ultrasoundanalysis,weuseddescriptivestatistics(meanandstandard deviation) and change from baseline (t-test, meanpercent change from baseline).For statistical comparisonconsidering treatment vs.placebo, we applied a linear re-gression analysis (ordinary least squares) model.For theVAS measures including VivaScope 1500, hyperpigmenta-tion, Glogau Scale of wrinkling, photodamage, and hairattributes, we used as above except for the change frombaseline (Wilcoxon signed-rank test).
For the SPQ re-sponses,percentageofthetop2positiveresponses(stronglyagree+agree) was reported. Te frequency of “top 2 box” responses was determined for each question.Te signif- cance of frequency responses was determined using a chi-squared test with a priori50/50 distribution assumption.3.Results 3.1.Study Cohorts, Adverse Events, and Protocol Deviations.A total of 140 volunteers were screened and 138 eligibleparticipants were enrolled, randomised, and split into 4parallel cohort test groups, comprising treatment vs.pla-cebo,forbothusedailyoruseevery48hours(Figure1).Twosubjects failed to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, and afurther8subjectsfailedtocompletethetrial.Tus,thefnal count was 48 subjects taking AC supplement daily vs.52takingplacebodailyand14subjectsvs.16subjectstakingtheAC supplement or placebo every 48hours, respectively.Asubsetofeachgroup(n �11takingtheACsupplementdaily vs.n�13 for the other groups) was assigned for clinical trichoscopy.
No adverse events were recorded, as expectedfor a dietary supplement. Two protocol deviations wereassessed.A target representation of 20% male participantswas not met, as only 10% of male participants who appliedand met inclusion criteria were recruited onto the study.Onesubjectwasrecruitedontotheclinicalbutlateranerrorwasfoundinwhichtheparticipantwasoutsidetheagerangefor the clinical and was therefore removed from furtheranalysis.Te assessment concluded that these protocoldeviations did not signifcantly afect the study.3.2.Te AC Supplement Improves Collagen Density and Re- duces Fragmentation.Expert visual grading of confocal images generated from the VivaScope showed a trend ofdecreasing collagen fragmentation, corresponding to animprovement in collagen density and structural integrity(Figure3).AsshowninTable1,followingdailyuseoftheACsupplement for 6weeks, the fragmentation VAS grade haddecreased 25.3% compared to the placebo, which showedonly minor changes (p<0.01).
By week 12, the fragmen- tationVASgradehaddecreased44.6%vs.placebo(p <0.01). Tus, the collagen fbres were increased in density and lessfragmented after daily use of AC vs.placebo.3.3.Ultrasound Shows Tat AC Supplement Improves Collagen Content.By week 12, with daily use of the AC supplement, the HEP signal had increased 231% frombaseline(p<0.01)comparedtotheplacebowhichincreased 176% from baseline (p<0.01).Te diference between treatment and placebo was not statistically signifcant.Byweek 6, the LEP u/LEPiratio had decreased 16.3% from baseline,comparedtoa9.5%decreasefortheplacebogroup(p<0.01).By week 12, the LEP u/LEPiratio had decreased 9.3% from baseline compared to a 7.8% decrease for theplacebo (p �0.05).3.4.Use of AC Supplement Improves Hydration,Elasticity, and Wrinkles.As summarised in Table 1 and Figure 4, using the AC supplement daily, at week 6, thehydration had signifcantly increased 7.5% vs.placebo(p<0.01).
By week 12, a further increase in hydration to 13.8%wasmeasuredcomparedtoplacebo(whichdecreased14.4%,p<0.01). Elasticity was measured as the skin re- sistance to the mechanical suction force (Ua) versus itsability to recover after release (Uf), where R2 �Ua/Uf.By week 6, for subjects taking the AC supplement daily, R2signifcantly increased20.6% vs.placebo(p <0.01).Byweek 12,theR2hadfurtherincreased22.7%vs.placebo(p <0.01).For measurement of fne lines and wrinkles, the Rz pa-rameter of the proflometry method was used, as this is theaccepted clinical standard by which the impact of HCsupplement use is measured.By week 6, for subjects taking the AC supplement, the Rz index had decreased 7.7% vs.placebo (p<0.01).By week 12, the Rz index had decreased 19.7% vs.placebo (p<0.01).3.5.ExpertVisualGradingandSelf-PerceptionofACEfcacyfor Skin Appearance.As can be seen in Table 1, after 12weeks of daily use of AC supplement, the Glogau Scorehad improved by 8.54% compared to placebo (p <0.01).
VAS score for expert grading of skin tone evenness showedDermatologyResearchandPractice 5 a 31.9% improvement in skin tone vs. placebo (p <0.01).By week 12, 87.5% of subjects reported that their skin felt more hydrated(vs.63.4%in the placebogroup),72.9% ofsubjectsreportedtheirskinfeltfrmer(vs.50%intheplacebogroup),62.5% reported that their wrinkles appeared reduced (vs.36.5% in the placebo group), and 62.5% of subject reported their skin had more elasticity and felt stronger from within(vs.28.8% in the placebo group).SPQ responses were sta-tistically signifcant (p<0.05) except for the self-perception of wrinkle reduction.3.6.Clinical Trichoscopy, Visual Grading, and SPQ Show AC Use Improves Scalp and Hair Condition.A trichoscope camera system was used to magnify scalp surface featuresand hair follicles up to 60-fold.Te scalp was assessed forinfammation, faking, plugging, and scaling.
When usingthe AC supplement daily for 12weeks, we measured anaverage increase of 11±29% improvement in VAS scalp scaling vs placebo (no change). Tis corresponded to anaverage increase of 33.4±26.2 total hairs counted per unit area (representing a 27.6% increase vs.placebo, p�n.s.).A detailed clinical analysis of scalp sebum, follicular plugging,andinfammation,inparalleltototalhairsperfollicularunitand mean hair diameter, shows improvements when usingthe AC supplement daily (manuscript in preparation fortrichology publication).By expert visual grading, hair healthy appearance was assessed on a 5-point scale.VAS score for hair healthyappearance improved 31.9% for subjects taking the ACsupplementdailyvs.9.4%ofsubjectswhotookplacebodaily(p<0.01).By week 12, SPQ reported that 66.7% of subjects felt their hair thicker vs.44.2% in the placebo group(p�0.02), whereas 77.1% of subjects reported that their hair felt smoother vs.55.8% in the placebo group (p <0.01).3.7.
AC Use Daily Shows Superior Efcacy Compared to UseEvery 48hours. As can be seen in Table 2 and Figure 5, for subjects consuming the AC supplement daily, by week 12,the fragmentation VAS grade had decreased 44.6% com-paredtosubjectstakingthesupplementoneverysecondday,in which case fragmentation grades had decreased 10.6%.Daily use of the AC supplement showed signifcantly im-proved collagen density, integrity, and a reduction offragmentation compared to use every 48hours (p <0.01); that is, the diference between the 2 treatment regimens wasstatistically signifcant.For subjects taking the AC supplement daily, by week 12, the elasticity index, R2, had increased 22.7% comparedto subjects taking the supplement on every second day, inwhich the R2 index had increased 18.6%.Te diferencebetween the 2 treatment regimens was not statisticallysignifcant.
By week 12, for subjects taking the AC Placebo Daily Treatment Daily Baseline Week 12 Figure3:Efectofsupplementonthecollagendensity,structure,andfragmentation.Representativeimagesfrom1subjectinthetreatment group and the placebo group are shown.

4.Discussion Photodamage is characterised by many attributes includingleathery texture, thin, fattened and dry features, fne linesand wrinkle formation, poor elastic recoil, fragility of theskin, and altered pigmentation due to haemoglobin andmelanin [18]. For over a decade, a key hypothesis proposesthat many of these problems are putatively related to loss ofcollagen, which can be reversed by the ingestion ofhydrolysed collagen supplements [19].In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we have provided evidence linking the use ofhydrolysed collagen supplements, with increased collagen content and quality in the skin.We demonstrated that this increased collagen in the skin is associated with improvedappearance indices such as hydration, elasticity, andwrinkles.
Te study was run during Q1, 2023 to efectivelyminimise variability due to seasonal changes, especiallyincreased UV-radiation during summer and anticipateddamage caused by UV-radiation to both dermal (collagenfragmentation and wrinkle formation) and epidermal(hydration and pigmentation) features. Collagen is a uniquely stable and long-lived protein with a half-life reported to be approximately 15years [20,21].Overthatdurationoftime,itcanbeinfuencedby extrinsic and intrinsic factors, including UV-radiation,glycation, hormonal fux, oxidative stress linked to free-radicalattack,mechanicalshearstress,andphysicalfatigue.In addition to direct damage, the production of matrixmetalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes, in particular collage-nase,cancleavethecollagentriplehelixandmakethefbreaccessible to degradation enzymes and cellular recycling[22].Te collagenases are critical to carry out the frstdegradation step, in which the fbres are cleaved intocharacteristic 1/4 and 3/4 fragments [11, 23].
Te resultant fragments can be visualised, quantifed, and represent collagen damage in the dermis. Te collagen fbres in situcan be described as hypore- fective (where it is not possible to identify single fbres),hyperefective (in which a well-defned, fbrous collagen canbe observed), thin reticulated collagen, coarse collagen,huddle collagen, and curled bright structures [24].AccordingtoBhardwajetal.,shortfragmentedcollagenanda huddled arrangement are typically seen in cases of dam-agedandpoorlyorientedcollageninagedorphotodamagedskin [25].Both the amount and quality of the collagen network changesovertime,withstate-of-the-artconfocallaserscanningmicroscopy (CLSM) being used to visualise and quantify suchchanges.Wehavepresentedimagesofthedermisinthecrow’s -50-40-30-20-100102030 Daily Every 48 hrsSkin Even Tone Proﬁlometry Rz Elasticity R2 Fragmentation ⁎⁎ ⁎⁎⁎p=n.s.Percentage Change from BaselineFigure5: Summary of AC use daily vs.use every 48hours.

Tis corresponds to visibleevidence of fragmented collagen which has been reported tounderline loss of skin elasticity and appearance of facial wrinkles.Following daily use of the AC supplement, an in- crease in collagen density and structural integrity can be ob-served in parallel to a decrease in fragmentation.Tisimprovement in dermal collagen content was not observed inthe placebo group.
Tis is in agreement with week 12 resultspresentedbyAsserinetal.[17],albeitwehaveshowntheefectoccurring as early as week 6, with progressive improvementsoverthe12-weekperiod.Wehavealsoshown,forthefrsttime,that this beneft is dependent on the dosing regimen. In addition to fragmentation, it is important to consider the density and quality of collagen in the dermis, paying particular attention to the stratifcation of collagen in re- lation to papillary and reticular fbroblast populations[26, 27].Papillary fbroblasts in the upper dermis have beenreported to secrete distinctly discernible thin, poorly or-ganized bundled collagen fbres, compared to the reticularfbroblasts which secrete thick, well-organized collagenbundles.TereisalsoadistinctpatternofthepapillaryECMexhibiting a higher ratio of collagen type III to type I,a pattern often observed in younger skin and also in woundhealing responses [11, 28].
Te characteristic organized, parallel-oriented, and bundled collagen fbrils are one of the key echogenic structures of the dermis. Te ultrasonographic markers included % pixel area (corresponding to collagen density),LEP, MEP, HEP, and the ratio of LEP u/LEPi.Te LEP in- dicator quantifes the degree of cutaneous hydration, in-fammatory processes, solar elastosis, and collagendegeneration.Te MEP and HEP indices quantify thestructures of collagen and elastin fbres and microfbrils.Ingeneral, an increase in collagen density, MEP, and HEP wasobserved (all which correspond to increased collagen in thedermis), although only the HEP showed an improvementcompared to placebo.Te variability in echogenic markers and strong placebo efect we hypothesise is due to the su- perimposition of innate collagen turnover mechanisms incombination with efects of the supplement.
Te increase in HEP pixel data is indicative of increased collagencontentandqualityinthedermis.Whenconsideredin the context of a decrease in the LEP u/LEPiratio, we surmise that this is evidence of improvements in the pap-illary and upper dermis. Tis is in agreement with previouspublications on changes on the LEP u/LEPiratio in the aged skin and following treatment with antiaging topical treat-ments (such as the topical favonoid and ε-viniferin) but needstobeindependentlyconfrmedinthecaseofdailyuseof HC supplements [29–31].Many of the published antiaging, hydrolysed collagen clinical trials, do not add vitamin C to the product beingtested.We regard the inclusion of vitamin C as a key factordriving efcacy of these supplements.Te role of vitamin C(l-ascorbic acid) as a cofactor required in the synthesis ofcollagen and the ECM is well documented, but theimportance of this vitamin as an antioxidant is oftenoverlooked.
Free radical damage to the skin is triggered byseveral mechanisms including UV-radiation, mitochondrialoxidative respiration, glycation, and lipid oxidation.Ascorbic acid neutralises a diverse number of free-radicalspecies to facilitate theirdetoxifcation[32]. Te consequent generation of a stable ascorbyl free radical yields a far less reactive species which efectively minimises free-radicaldamage and protects the long-lived collagen fbres in theskin [33].Linking changes in dermal collagen content to pheno- typic and visible skin attributes is important to the overallacceptanceandcredibilityoftheuseofhydrolysedcollagen-based supplements.Studies using proflometry show thearchitecture of the uppermost layers of the skin, either asmicrorelief(includingfneslines)orlargerstructuressuchaswrinkles.Te skin microrelief changes with age in- dependently of wrinkle formation, and thus any model of proflometric analysis of the skin needs to account for theseindependent characteristics.
Fine lines and wrinkles weresignifcantly decreased at both timepoints, and this im-provement was not observed in the placebo group. Skinhydrationandelasticityweresignifcantlyincreased after 6weeks and 12weeks use of the AC supplement, indirect contrast to the placebo which showed negligiblechange from baseline, or even a deterioration of skin pa-rameters at both timepoints.Te efects of supplement onelasticity are likely due to changes in collagen content inaddition to changes in elastin and glycosaminoglycan contentofthedermis.Tedecreaseinhydrationobservedin the placebo group is likely due to the fact that the clinicaltrial was run during the winter season, where many peopleexperience some degree of dry skin/winter xerosis, associ-ated with low temperature and low humidity.Te use of supplements as a support to a healthy and varied diet is an issue of popular debate.
A key questionarises as to the frequency of use of the supplement andspecifcally whether daily use of the will yield more, or less,skin benefts compared to less frequent use (e.g., every48hours). We tested this hypothesis in a parallel cohort to the main clinical evaluation group.Te statistical model usedtoevaluatethesedataisreferredtoastheordinaryleastsquares regression model.Tis model is not biased by thefact that the two groups, of daily and 48hour supplementuse, have diferent number of subjects (n �100 vs.n�30, respectively).If each group has a sufcient number ofsubjects to determine signifcance, the overall model will besufciently powerful in determining the signifcance be-tween groups, thus minimising the possibility of statisticalbias when comparing daily use of the supplement, with useevery 48hours.
Te choice to take supplements daily, or on alternate days, can be driven by information derived from onlinecontent,bypersonalpreferences,orbyfnancialconstraints.Regardless of a reason, there was to date no published ev-idence to support the impact of the dosing regimen onclinical efcacy and benefts when taking hydrolysed col-lagen supplements. We present here the frst clinical evi-dence, measured against placebo, that proves that taking10 DermatologyResearchandPractice asupplementonalternatedayswilldecreasethebeneftsand reduceefcacyforskincollagen,wrinkles,andskintone.Wehave shown that taking the AC supplement daily is moreefcaciousthanuseevery48hours,andthisshouldbebornein mind by consumers who wish to vary their dosingregimen.5.Conclusion We have shown that an AC supplement, when consumeddaily over 12weeks, can improve collagen content in thedermis.
Furthermore, there is an association between col-lagen fbres in the dermis and aging features such as hy-dration, elasticity, and wrinkles. We have extended this toincludetrichoscopeandclinicalassessmentofscalpandhaircondition.We have shown that the efcacy of the supple-ment is directly dependent on dose regimen, with subjectswho take the supplement every 48hours show less efcacythan subjects who take the AC supplement daily.Tese data clearly demonstrate that taking a marine-sourced, hydro- lysedcollagenplusvitaminCsupplementdailycanimproveskin, scalp, and hair.Data Availability Te data used to support the fndings of this study areavailable from the corresponding author upon request.Ethical Approval Te protocol was approved by an independent EthicsCommittee(signedbythechairmanoftheEastAngliaEthicsCommittee on 09.01.2023).Te study conformed to the requirements of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.Consent Awrittendeclarationofinformedconsentwasreceivedfrom all participants.
