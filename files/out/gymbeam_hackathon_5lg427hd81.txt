Using a comprehensive quadrupleisotope tracer feeding-infusion approach, we show that the ingestion of 100 g protein results in a greater andmore prolonged (>12 h) anabolic response when compared to the ingestion of 25 g protein.We demonstrate adose-response increase in dietary-protein-derived plasma amino acid availability and subsequent incorpo-ration into muscle protein.
Ingestion of a large bolus of protein further increases whole-body protein net bal- ance, mixed-muscle, myoﬁbrillar, muscle connective, and plasma protein synthesis rates. Protein ingestion has a negligible impact on whole-body protein breakdown rates or amino acid oxidation rates.These ﬁndingsdemonstrate that the magnitude and duration of the anabolic response to protein ingestion is not restrictedand has previously been underestimated in vivo in humans.INTRODUCTION Skeletal muscle tissue is in a constant state of turnover, with co- ordinated up- and down-regulation of muscle protein synthesis and muscle protein breakdown rates.This turnover allows mus- cle tissue to remodel by replacing damaged proteins and chang-ing the muscle tissue protein composition.A net gain or loss ofmuscle protein occurs as a consequence of a positive or nega- tive muscle protein balance (synthesis minus breakdown).
Because muscle protein synthesis rates have a higher capacityto ﬂuctuate when compared to muscle protein breakdown rates, postprandial muscle protein balance is assumed to be largely governed by changes in muscle protein synthesis rates. 1,2In- creases in muscle protein synthesis rates are mainly driven by protein ingestion and muscle contraction.1–5 Stable isotope methodology allows the assessment of dietary- protein-derived amino acid kinetics and the metabolic fate ofingested-protein-derived amino acids.
6Brieﬂy, ingested protein is ﬁrst digested, after which amino acids are absorbed in the gut.7–9Some of the absorbed amino acids undergo ﬁrst-pass splanchnic extraction,10,11but the majority of the protein-derived amino acids are released into the circulation, where they can be taken up by the peripheral tissues.4,9,12Subsequently, the amino acids can either be incorporated into tissue protein (protein syn- thesis) and/or catabolized (oxidation).9,13Protein-derived aminoacids not only serve as metabolic precursors but also act as important signaling molecules that regulate anabolic and cata- bolic pathways.14–16Speciﬁcally, the mammalian target of rapa- mycin complex 1 (mTOR1) signaling cascade, which regulates cell growth and metabolism, is particularly sensitive to changes in plasma essential amino acid and leucine availability.17 Dose-response studies have reported that ingestion of 20–25 g protein is sufﬁcient to maximize postexercise muscle protein syn- thesis rates in healthy, young adults, with no further increase in muscle protein synthesis rates when larger amounts of proteinare consumed.
18–20Higher protein intake did not further increase anabolic signaling, and excess amino acids are suggested to be oxidized.18,19Consequently, it is currently advised to distribute protein intake evenly throughout the day, with each main meal providing no more than 20–25 g protein.21,22Though this makes sense based on typical dietary intake patterns in humans, itseems to be at odds with the feeding practices of many animalspecies in nature that consume large amounts of food infre- quently.
23This is most notable in snakes, in which the ingestion of a large meal ( R25% body mass [BM]) results in prolonged protein digestion, amino acid absorption, and elevated protein synthesis rates ( /C2410 days), with only /C245% of the ingested protein being directed toward amino acid oxidation.24–27Such data challenge the concept of transient anabolic responses to feeding in humans and the concept of muscle tissue having a limited Cell Reports Medicine 4, 101324, December 19, 2023 ª2023 The Author(s). 1 This is an open access article under the CC BY license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ).ll OPEN ACCESS capacity to incorporate dietary-derived amino acids.Further- more, this concept has been based on metabolic tracer studies in vivo in humans that have been conﬁned to the assessment of the postprandial protein synthetic response following the inges-tion of moderate amounts of protein ( %45 g) over relatively short durations ( %6 h).
18–20When ingesting larger amounts of protein, such a short time frame will likely be insufﬁcient to allow completedigestion and amino acid absorption 12and, therefore, does not provide a reliable assessment of postprandial protein handling. In the present study, we comprehensively assessed the time resolution of postprandial protein handling in response to theingestion of moderate and large amounts of protein (0, 25, and 100 g) following exercise on a whole-body, muscle-tissue, and myocellular level in vivo in humans.To this end, we applied a quadruple isotope tracer feeding-infusion approach combined with frequent plasma and muscle tissue sample collection over a 12-h period.Here, we conﬁrm our hypothesis of a dose-depen-dent increase in the magnitude and duration of protein-derivedamino acid availability and muscle and whole-body protein syn- thesis rates, with a negligible impact on amino acid oxidation.
This work highlights that tissues have a much higher capacityto incorporate exogenous-protein-derived amino acids than pre- viously assumed and that the duration of the postprandial period is proportional to the size of the ingested meal. RESULTSTo test our hypothesis, we produced intrinsically labeled milk protein, which was subsequently applied in a randomizedcontrolled trial in human participants.Subjects were randomizedto receive 25 g protein (25PRO), 100 g protein (100PRO), or a pla- cebo (0PRO) following a single bout of resistance-type exercise.Stable isotope amino acid infusions were applied, and blood andmuscle tissue samples were collected over time to assess the time course of postprandial protein handling.See Figure 1 A for schematics of the study design.A detailed description of themethods applied is presented in the STAR Methods section.
Production of tailored intrinsically labeled protein to avoid destabilizing precursor enrichments Here, we improved on the production method of intrinsically labeled protein to maintain steady-state tracer conditionsfollowing protein ingestion. 28In brief, we produced higher and lower labeled protein batches to ﬁne-tune the ﬁnal enrichment level.We calculated that an intrinsically L-[1-13C]-leucine labeled protein enrichment of 8 MPE would be required to maintain a steady state in plasma L-[1-13C]-leucine enrichment following protein ingestion.However, the production of milk protein witha tailored enrichment level has remained difﬁcult due to biolog- ical variation in cows and their milk yield.To circumvent this issue, we produced higher and lower enriched milk proteinconcentrate (MPC) batches by collecting milk both during andfollowing the cow tracer infusion period, respectively.
L- [1- 13C]-leucine enrichment was 10.8 and 2.4 MPE in the higher and lower enriched MPC batches, respectively. L-[1-13C]- phenylalanine enrichment was 38.3 and 7.7 MPE in the higher and lower enriched MPC batches, respectively.Accounting for the amino acid proﬁle and enrichment level of both batches,we mixed the higher and lower enriched MPCs in a 67:33 ratio to produce MPC with an L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine enrichment of 31.6 MPE and an L-[1-13C]-leucine enrichment of 8.0 MPE.Thus, we demonstrate here for the ﬁrst time that the productionof higher and lower intrinsically labeled protein batches from the same animal experiment allows subsequent mixing to ensure that the desired enrichment level is achieved.Sustained hyperaminoacidemia following the ingestion of a large amount of proteinThe plasma amino acid response following protein ingestion is often used as a proxy for protein digestion, amino acid absorp- tion, and overall protein bioavailability.
7Furthermore, increases in circulating amino acid concentrations represent major determi- nants of the muscle and whole-body protein synthetic response to feeding.29,30We applied frequent blood sampling to assess the time course of the plasma amino acid response to proteinfeeding. We observed elevated plasma alanine concentrations immediately following exercise and before protein consumption (t = 0 min; Figure S1 ), indicating that the resistance-type exercise bout elicited an acute stress response.31 Protein ingestion rapidly increased plasma amino acid con- centrations in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1 D).Plasma amino acid concentrations were higher during the ﬁrst 5 h following ingestion of 25 g protein when compared to the control condition (placebo).Ingestion of 100 g protein resulted in agreater rise in circulating plasma amino acid concentrations, which remained higher throughout the entire 12-h postprandial period.
In line with this, the postprandial increase in plasma L-[1- 13C]-phenylalanine enrichments (tracer originating exclusively from the ingested protein) was greater and more prolonged following ingestion of 100 compared to 25 g protein ( Figure 1 J). Plasma L-[2H5]-phenylalanine enrichments (tracer originating exclusively from the intravenous infusion) showed a dose- response deviation from the steady-state conditions ( Figure 1 H).In line with our calculations, plasma L-[1-13C]-leucine enrich- ments (tracer originating from both the ingested protein and the intravenous infusion) were /C248 MPE before protein ingestion and remained completely stable throughout the postprandialperiod regardless of the amount of ingested protein ( Figure 1 I).Our data demonstrate that the magnitude and duration of the plasma amino acid response increases with a greater dose of ingested protein.
Furthermore, a combination of stable isotopeinfusion and ingestion of speciﬁcally tailored intrinsically labeled protein is required to maintain postprandial plasma tracer steady-state conditions following the ingestion of a single bolusof protein. Dose-dependent increases in amino acid kinetics and whole-body protein metabolism Plasma amino acid concentrations and amino acid tracer enrich-ments are the net consequence of multiple amino acid ﬂuxes intoand out of the systemic circulation.Therefore, we applied a quadruple isotope tracer feeding-infusion method to quantify both exogenous and endogenous plasma amino acid kinetics.Exogenous-dietary-protein-derived amino acid appearance into the circulation was signiﬁcantly higher in 100PRO when compared to 25PRO over the entire 12-h postprandial period 2Cell Reports Medicine 4, 101324, December 19, 2023Articlell OPEN ACCESS (Figure 2 B).
In contrast, the endogenous tissue protein-derived amino acid rates of appearance into the circulation did not differbetween treatments ( Figure 2 C). The total rate of amino acid disappearance from the circulation into peripheral tissues increased in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 D), with no ev- idence of any saturation effect.The assessment of exogenous and endogenous plasma amino acid kinetics allowed us to calculate whole-body proteinmetabolism.It is generally believed that protein ingestion stimu- lates whole-body protein synthesis rates up to a maximal level, after which excess amino acids are being directed towardoxidation.13,32Here, we observed a further increase in both whole-body protein synthesis and amino acid oxidation ratesfollowing the ingestion of 25 and 100 g protein, respectively (Figures 2 G and 2H).However, the concurrent increase in amino acid oxidation rates was negligible when compared to the whole-body protein synthetic response ( Figure 2 J).
Collectively, this re- sulted in a strong positive correlation between protein intake and whole-body protein net balance ( Figure 2 L). These data demon- strate that the ingestion of a large amount of protein results in prolonged protein digestion, amino acid absorption, and continued amino acid release into the circulation.Subsequently, Figure 1.Schematics of study design and plasma amino responses following protein ingestion (A) Experimental scheme.

Muscletissue free phenylalanine concentrations (the amino acid used for the assessment of whole-body amino acid metabolism) did not differ between treatments ( Figure 3 A). These data imply that the previously observed postprandial expansion of the muscle free phenylalanine pool is short lived (<4 h), which will only impact the assessment of whole-body protein metabolism when it isassessed over shorter postprandial periods.In contrast to the clear dose-response increase in plasma total amino acid concen-trations, muscle tissue free amino acid concentrations were not impacted by protein ingestion ( Figure 3 J).In fact, muscle tissue free total amino acid concentrations showed a minor declineover time.An exception to this pattern were the branched-chain amino acids leucine ( Figure 3 B), isoleucine, and valine, which were signiﬁcantly higher in 100PRO over the entire 12-h postpran-dial period when compared to 25PRO or 0PRO ( Figure S2 ).

In contrast, muscle-protein-bound L-[1-13C]-phenylal- anine incorporation increased linearly throughout the entire 12-hpostprandial period following the ingestion of 100 g protein.Our data conﬁrm the assumption of a stable muscle free pool that is required for the accurate assessment of whole-bodyprotein metabolism.Furthermore, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time a selective increase in leucine availability in the muscle free pool, which may support its role as a signaling molecule.In addition, these data conﬁrm our hypothesis that the inges-tion of a large amount of protein results in a prolonged and greater dietary-protein-derived amino acid incorporation into muscle tissue.
Prolonged muscle protein synthetic response to protein ingestionHaving established an increase in (exogenous) dietary-protein- derived amino acid incorporation into muscle tissue, we wanted to determine whether this translated to greater postprandialmuscle protein synthesis rates. We assessed the muscle proteinsynthetic response in multiple protein fractions (mixed-muscle, myoﬁbrillar protein, and muscle connective protein), based on two precursor pools (plasma and muscle free enrichments), with two different amino acid tracers (L-[ 2H5]-phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]-leucine) over 4-h intervals during the 12-h post- prandial period ( Figures 4 A and 4B).
Myoﬁbrillar protein synthe- sis rates over the entire 12-h postprandial period using theplasma L-[1- 13C]-leucine precursor pool were the predeﬁned pri- mary outcome, as frequent plasma sampling allows conﬁrmation that our combined isotope tracer feeding-infusion method suc-cessfully maintained L-[1- 13C]-leucine steady-state conditions despite the ingestion of different amounts of protein. In agreement with our hypothesis, we observed a clear dose- dependent pattern in muscle protein synthesis rates when as-sessed over the entire 12-h postprandial period (100PRO > 25PRO > 0PRO).Only myoﬁbrillar protein synthesis rates based on the plasma L-[1- 13C]-leucine precursor differed signiﬁcantly between all 3 treatments ( Figure 4 G).We expected that the greater cumulative muscle protein synthetic response in 100PRO vs.25PRO would be predominately the result of amore sustained anabolic response of the myoﬁbrillar protein Figure 3.

For all measurem ents, n = 12 biological replicates.6Cell Reports Medicine 4, 101324, December 19, 2023Articlell OPEN ACCESS fraction.In line with this, myoﬁbrillar protein synthesis rates were only /C2420% higher during the early 0- to 4-h period but /C2440% higher during the subsequent 4- to 12- h period in 100PRO when compared to 25 PRO.Previous studies have failed to observe an anabolic effect of protein ingestion on muscle connective protein synthesis rates.34–36Here, we observed higher muscle connective protein synthesis rates following ingestion of 25 and 100 g proteinthroughout the initial 4-h postprandial period ( Figure 4 K).
In addi- tion, muscle connective protein synthesis rates were also higher following ingestion of 100 g protein when compared to the pla-cebo condition over the entire 12-h postprandial period, with in- termediate values following ingestion of 25 g protein. This anabolic response was evident despite the absence of an in-crease in plasma or muscle tissue free glycine concentrations (Figures 3 J and S2).In fact, muscle free glycine concentrations were signiﬁcantly decreased following the ingestion of 100 g pro-tein.In contrast to our prior speculations, 34,35these data indicate that elevated postprandial glycine concentrations in the plasma and muscle tissue free pool are not essential to allow a postpran- dial increase in muscle connective protein synthesis rates.Over-all, both the initial increase and the duration of the postprandial increase in muscle protein synthesis rates are largely dependent on the amount of protein ingested.
Dissociation between postprandial muscle physiological and molecular responses It has been well established that protein ingestion results in the upregulation of anabolic signaling and amino acid transportgene expression. 15,16To gain more insight into the regulation of the muscle protein synthetic response to protein ingestion, we assessed the protein signaling and gene expression levels of selected targets involved in muscle anabolism, catabolism,and amino acid uptake.We observed time-dependent changes in all the selected genes known to be upregulated following an exercise bout.In contrast, we did not observe any impact of pro-tein feeding on muscle protein signaling or muscle gene expres- sion ( Figure 5 ).This is in line with previous work that suggests that the molecular response in skeletal muscle to protein inges-tion is short lived (<4 h).
16,37Here, we extend these data by demonstrating that the muscle anabolic response to protein ingestion is sustained well beyond ( R12 h) the frequently re- ported transient changes in molecular signaling. Collectively,these data suggest substantial divergence in the time course of the molecular response and the actual metabolic response to feeding ( Figure 5 Y).Therefore, the magnitude and/or time course of muscle molecular responses should not be used as a proxy to evaluate the magnitude of the postprandial anabolic response to feeding.No limit to protein-derived amino acid bioavailability and subsequent tissue incorporationThe production of intrinsically labeled protein allowed us to quantify the metabolic fate of ingested-protein-derived amino acids.The absolute amount of dietary-protein-derived aminoacids appearing in the circulation over the 12-h postprandial period was substantially higher following ingestion of 100 when compared to 25 g protein (53 ±7 vs.
16 ±1 g, respectively)(Figures 6 A and 6D). When expressed as a percentage of the in- gested protein, cumulative dietary-protein-derived amino acid release into the circulation averaged 51%, 62%, and 66% over 4, 8, and 12 h, respectively, following the ingestion of 25 g pro-tein.In contrast, dietary-protein-derived amino acid release into the circulation following ingestion of 100 g protein did not plateau, with 26%, 44%, and 53% of the ingested-protein-derived amino acids appearing over 4, 8, and 12 h, respectively.These data show that the ingestion of larger amounts of protein requires a more prolonged period to allow full digestion, amino acid absorption, and subsequent amino acid release into thecirculation.We have previously estimated that the ingestion of 20 g protein results in /C2410% ( /C242 g) of the ingested-protein-derived amino acids to become incorporated in skeletal muscle tissue throughout a 6-h postprandial period.
4In the current study, we calculated that 12%, 15%, and 18% of the ingested proteinwas incorporated into skeletal muscle following ingestion of25 g protein throughout 4-, 8-, and 12-h periods, respectively (Figures 6 B and 6D). The higher values observed in the present study are attributed to the prior exercise bout that stimulatesamino acid incorporation by skeletal muscle tissue.5,38,39Die- tary-protein-derived amino acid incorporation into skeletal mus- cle essentially increased linearly over the entire postprandialfollowing the ingestion of 100 g protein (13 g or 13% of the in- gested protein).These data demonstrate that skeletal muscle tissue has a much greater capacity to incorporate exogenousamino acids than previously suggested.While muscle tissue is known for its plasticity in response to anabolic stimuli, it has a relatively low turnover rate whencompared to other tissues.
13,40Plasma proteins have a very high turnover rate and are believed to have a saturable protein synthetic response to protein ingestion.18Therefore, we also as- sessed the amount of ingested protein incorporated into plasmaprotein and plasma protein synthesis rates. Dietary-protein- derived amino acid incorporation into plasma protein was esti- mated to average 2 and 4 g over the 12-h period following inges-tion of 25 and 100 g protein, respectively (representing 6% and 4% of the ingested protein, respectively) ( Figures 6 B and 6D).These data demonstrate that incorporation into plasma proteinrepresents a minor metabolic fate of ingested protein whencompared to skeletal muscle tissue.However, these values are relatively high when considering the small plasma protein pool size.This is explained by an up to 8-fold higher plasma pro-tein synthesis rate when compared to muscle tissue.
Plasma protein synthesis rates showed similar dose-response patterns (100PRO > 25PRO > 0PRO) over both the initial 4-h period aswell as the full 12-h postprandial period ( Figure 6 E). Plasma pro- tein synthesis rates were approximately 14% and 20% higher following ingestion of 100 compared to 25 g protein over theinitial 4-h and full 12-h periods, respectively.In line with muscle and whole-body protein, these data demonstrate that larger amounts of protein increase the magnitude and duration of theplasma protein synthetic response.Previous work suggests that endogenous-protein-derived amino acids are the main precursors for muscle protein synthesis based on heterogeneity in precursor pool enrichments.41Our cur- rent observations are in line with and extend these observations Cell Reports Medicine 4, 101324, December 19, 2023 7Articlell OPEN ACCESS by assessing the incorporation of exogenous- and endogenous- protein-derived amino acids into muscle tissue protein.
Weobserved that exogenous-protein-derived amino acids contrib-uted 9% and 27% to total amino acid incorporation following the ingestion of a meal-like amount of protein (25PRO) and the large amount of protein (100PRO), respectively ( Figure 6 H). The higher myoﬁbrillar protein synthesis rates following ingestion of 100 compared to 25 g protein was almost entirely driven by the incorporation of exogenous-protein-derived amino acids.In line,the postprandial increase in amino acid release into the circulation and plasma amino acid uptake into peripheral tissues was almost entirely driven by exogenous-protein-derived amino acids(Figures 6 F and 6G).Despite the dose-dependent increase in exogenous-protein-derived amino acid incorporation, endoge-nous amino acids provided a greater contribution to total aminoacid incorporation in the postprandial state (91% and 73% in 25PRO and 100PRO, respectively).
Collectively, these data show that the ingestion of a large amount of protein requires a pro-longed time period to allow complete protein digestion, amino acid absorption, exogenous-protein-derived amino acid release into the circulation, and subsequent amino acid incorporationinto tissue protein pools. Therefore, the duration of the postpran- dial state is dependent on the amount of ingested protein, with the capacity to exceed 12 h.Figure 5.

These data providevaluable mechanistic insight into the ongoing controversy of the impact of different feeding strategies as a meansto optimize muscle tissue anabolism and/or metabolic health. It is generally believed that the inges- tion of /C2420 g protein maximizes post- prandial muscle protein synthesis rates at rest and during recovery from exercisein healthy, young adults.However, the clinical evidence for this is based on dose-response studies with a small rangeof protein intakes ( %45 g) and relative short assessment periods ( %6 h).18–20 Here, we comprehensively assessed the time course of postprandial proteinhandling by applying a quadruple isotope tracer feeding-infusion approach in vivo in humans.
To investigate potential upperlimits and/or sustained elevation of post- prandial protein metabolism, we provided the proposed optimal amount (25 g) andthe largest amount of protein that weconsider feasible to consume in a single meal (100 g) and evaluated postprandial protein handling throughout a prolonged 12-h assessment period. We observedhigher plasma, muscle, and whole-body protein synthesis rates following the ingestion of 100 g protein when compared to 25 g protein and placebo, respectively.The greater metabolic re-sponses were present during the early postprandial phase (0–4 h) but were even more pronounced during the prolonged post- prandial phase (4–12 h).
These data support our hypothesisthat even very large amounts of dietary protein are effectively Cell Reports Medicine 4, 101324, December 19, 2023 9Articlell OPEN ACCESS utilized to support postprandial tissue anabolism but require a more prolonged period for complete protein digestion and amino acid absorption to become available for incorporation into tissues. It has been proposed that when dietary protein is consumed beyond the rate by which it can be utilized for protein synthesis, the excess amino acids will be directed toward oxidation.13,32 Our data do not provide any evidence for an upper limit to the whole-body protein synthetic response and, therefore, any disproportional increase in amino acid oxidation following the ingestion of a large amount of protein.In fact, postprandial aminoacid oxidation rates were negligible when expressed relative to the increase in whole-body protein synthesis rates ( Figure 2 J).
Therefore, we reassessed amino acid oxidation rates reportedin previous dose-response studies by expressing them relative to protein intake. 18,19This revealed that postprandial amino acid oxidation rates represent a relative minor metabolic fate(<15% of the increment in ingested protein), supporting our ﬁnd- ings that the majority of the ingested protein (>85%) is utilized for tissue protein synthesis.Furthermore, these ﬁndings seem robust, as they have been observed following ingestion ofdifferent types of protein while using different assessment tech- niques and amino acid tracers to assess amino acid oxidation rates (phenylalanine hydroxylation in the present study and byWitard et al.19and breath13CO 2production from leucine by Moore et al.18).Collectively, these data refute the notion that amino acid oxidation functions as a sink for excess amino acid provision.
In the present study, milk protein was applied because it is the food item with the largest contribution to daily protein intake in the Western world.42Because milk protein consists of 20% rapid digestible whey protein and 80% slowly digestible casein pro- tein, it could be speculated that a more prolonged anabolic response to protein ingestion is unique to slowly digestible Figure 7. Illustration of the postprandial protein handling Illustration of study results.Following protein ingestion, exogenous-protein-derived amino acids are released into the circulation, resulting in increased plasma amino acid concentrations.Subsequently, amino acids are taken up by tissues, resulting in an increase in whole-body protein synthesis and net balan ce, with negligible impact on amino acid oxidation.Protein ingestion does not expand the muscle free amino acid pool but stimulates ( de novo ) muscle protein synthesis rates.
Postprandial myocellular protein signaling and gene expression become dissociated from the sustained postprandial increase in muscle prot ein synthesis rates. The magnitude and duration of the metabolic responses are proportional to the ingested amount of protein.Arrows are based on the statistical signiﬁcance of the current study with n = 12 biological replicates for all measurements with the exception of the re al-time qPCR data, which were n = 8 or 9.10Cell Reports Medicine 4, 101324, December 19, 2023Articlell OPEN ACCESS proteins.More rapidly digestible proteins may be disproportion- ally oxidized and, as such, may result in less amino acids being available for de novo protein synthesis.3However, previous dose-response studies that administered rapidly digestible pro-tein observed that postprandial amino acid oxidation is actually very limited.
18,19Moreover, we observed no differences in mus- cle protein synthesis rates following the ingestion of relativelylarge doses of whey and casein protein, 43implying that more rapidly digestible proteins do not result in disproportional (high) amino acid oxidation rates. Collectively, these data indicate that the metabolic responses observed in the present studyare unlikely to be restricted to more slowly digestible proteins and are generalizable to other proteins despite different diges- tion kinetics.It has been well established that leucine is a key regulator of the mTOR1 pathway in various tissues.17We observed that the ingestion of a large amount of protein resulted in an increase inplasma amino acid availability (including leucine).This increasein plasma amino acid availability was not mirrored by an increase in free amino acid concentrations in muscle tissue, as only mus- cle free branched-chain amino acids concentrations (leucine,isoleucine, and valine) were elevated.
Despite the sustained intra- and extracellular increase in leucine availability, the post- prandial increase in anabolic myocellular signaling was transient.These data support prior evidence that increased leucine avail- ability plays a critical role in the initial (<4 h) stimulation of post- prandial tissue anabolism. Importantly, we extend on this workby showing that prolonged leucine availability does not result in prolonged mTOR activation and that enhanced anabolic signaling is not required to perpetuate the postprandial increasein muscle protein synthesis rate.We observed that the plasma, muscle, and whole-body pro- tein synthetic responses increased in relation to the magnitude and timeline of the postprandial amino acid response to feeding.This implies that following the activation of anabolic signaling by the postprandial increase in leucine availability, protein synthesis rates are mainly modulated by the availability of amino acids assubstrate.
In line, we observed that the anabolic responses to feeding corresponded to postprandial plasma amino kinetics (i.e., rate of plasma amino acid appearance and disappearance).Furthermore, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that protein inges-tion has a minor impact on endogenous amino acid ﬂuxes, with exogenous amino acid ﬂuxes responding in line with the amount of protein ingested. The relative contribution of exogenous-pro-tein-derived amino acids to overall amino acid release into the circulation, plasma amino acid uptake into tissues, and amino acid incorporation into myoﬁbrillar protein were remarkablysimilar (32%, 30%, and 27%, respectively, following ingestion of 100 g protein).Collectively, these data demonstrate that pro- tein ingestion results in a coordinated ﬂux of exogenous-protein-derived amino acids toward incorporation in tissue protein that is additive to the endogenous amino acid ﬂux.
Meal frequency has been proposed as an important modulator of tissue and whole-body metabolism. For example, dietaryguidelines in both health and disease typically recommend an equal distribution of daily protein requirements over the main meals to support muscle anabolism.21,22These recommenda- tions are based entirely on the belief that the muscle proteinsynthetic response to ingestion of a single bolus of protein has a ceiling and is short lived.The current ﬁndings provide evidence to support more ﬂexibility in feeding patterns aimed at enhancing muscle anabolism.Speciﬁcally, we show that the ingestion of asingle large amount of protein is followed by a prolonged anabolic response, which would obviate the need to consume another protein-rich meal in close temporal proximity.This mayexplain why time-restricted feeding patterns do not seem tocompromise muscle mass maintenance.
44–46Our data suggest that time-restricted feeding may not result in a postabsorptive state until far beyond the end of the feeding window. This is ofrelevance since time-restricted feeding is typically applied to avoid prolonged postprandial periods, which are believed to be undesirable for metabolic health.47,48Furthermore, it has been speculated that sustained anabolism and mTOR activation inhibit clearance of compromised proteins.49However, we observed that the ingestion of a single, large amount of protein(100 g) resulted in prolonged anabolism without compromisingwhole-body protein breakdown rates, muscle mTOR signaling, or markers of muscle autophagy.Collectively, our data suggest that time-restricted feeding protocols likely overestimate thelength of their postabsorptive windows but also that a postab- sorptive state is not required to allow protein clearance.
Limitations of the study The ingestion of 100 g protein resulted in several prolongedmetabolic responses that did not return to baseline values at the end of the 12-h assessment period. Therefore, the cumula- tive metabolic responses are likely even bigger than we wereable to observe, and our assessment of the metabolic fate of in- gesting 100 g should be considered minimal estimates.A sec- ond limitation is that tracer recycling can occur during prolongedamino acid tracer infusion.50Therefore, our tracer-derived meta- bolic rates may be slight underestimations.The degree of under- estimation would correlate with the dose-dependent tracerincorporation rates (100PRO > 25PRO > 0PRO).Consequently, the magnitude of difference between treatments would be even greater than observed.The measurement of AA-tRNA, asthe preferred precursor pool, is generally not assessed, as therequired amount of muscle tissue is not feasible for routine ana- lyses.
Therefore, the presented (absolute) muscle protein syn- thesis rates may be regarded as slight underestimations. How-ever, we demonstrate that the observed muscle protein synthetic response is robust across various fractions, tracers, and precursors pools.We observed a consistent anabolicresponse at the composite whole-body, muscle, and plasma protein level.However, it should be noted that these protein syn- thetic responses may not be similar or may even move in thesame direction when assessed within different (organ) tissues and between different (sets) of proteins within these compart- ments.51As the present work was acute in nature, it is possible that the metabolic response to protein ingestion is modiﬁedover time.
For example, it could be speculated that amino acid oxidation may increase in response to frequent, prolonged epi- sodes of hyperaminoacidemia or that large postprandial proteingains are compensated for by upregulation of amino acid oxida- tion in a subsequent fasted state. 52Our data provide a mecha- nistic explanation for why larger but less frequent meals are a Cell Reports Medicine 4, 101324, December 19, 2023 11Articlell OPEN ACCESS viable alternative to consuming smaller meals more frequently.A ﬁnal consideration is that we investigated healthy, young men following a bout of whole-body resistance exercise and do not know if our observations can be extrapolated to other popula-tions and/or conditions.It has been well established that the anabolic sensitivity to amino acids is lower in individuals that are more clinically compromised and/or have lower physicalactivity levels.
53While there are data that suggest that a blunted anabolic response to feeding in these populations can be compensated for by the ingestion of larger amounts of protein,54 it is possible that these more clinically compromised individuals may experience a ceiling response in the magnitude and/or duration of the anabolic response to protein ingestion.

Subject characteristics are presented in Table S1 . Pretesting Participants underwent an initial screening session to assess height, weight, and body composition.Body composition was as- sessed by bioelectric impedance (Star Test protocol, BioScan 920-2, Maltron International, Essex, UK).Participants were deemedhealthy based on their responses to a medical questionnaire and screening results.The subjects were then familiarized with the resis- tance-type exercise protocol and the exercise equipment.All exercises during pretesting and experimental trials were supervised by trained personnel.Subjects started by performing a 5-min cycling warm-up at 100 W before completing an estimation of their1-repetition maximum (1-RM) on the leg press, leg extension, chest press, and lat pulldown exercises using the multiple repetitions testing procedure.
55For each exercise, subjects performed 10 submaximal repetitions to become familiarized with the equipment and to have lifting technique critiqued and properly adjusted. Sets were then performed at progressively increasing loads until failureto perform a valid estimation within 3–6 repetitions of the set.A repetition was valid if the subject was able to complete the entire lift ina controlled manner without assistance.A 2-min resting period between subsequent attempts was allowed.The pretesting and experimental trials were separated by at least 7 days.Diet and physical activity All subjects were instructed to refrain from exhaustive physical labor and exercise and to keep their diet as constant as possible 2 days before the experimental day.
Food intake and physical activity questionnaires were collected for 2 days before the experiment.The evening before the trial, all participants were instructed to consume a prepackaged standardized meal containing 54 kJ kg /C01with 60% energy as carbohydrate, 25% energy as fat, and 15% energy as fat.
Participants were instructed to ﬁnish it before 22:00 h, after which they remained fasted.Continued REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER 18S taqman probe Fisher Emergo Hs03003631_g1 Critical commercial assays Glucose HK CP ABX Pentra A11A01667 Insulin Elisa kit Meso Scale Discovery K151BZC-3 Software Image Studio 5.2 LI-COR biosciences 5.2 Prism GraphPad Software v7.0a SPSS IBM 27.0.1.0 BioRender BioRender https://www.biorender.com/ e2Cell Reports Medicine 4, 101324, December 19, 2023Articlell OPEN ACCESS Study design Participants were randomly assigned to ingest a beverage containing 800 mL water with either 0 g, 25 g, or 100 g intrinsically L- [1-13C]-phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]-leucine labeled milk protein (described below). Randomization was performed using a comput- erized list randomizer ( http://www.randomization.com/ ) and participants were sequentially allocated to a treatment according to the randomized list.
An independent person was responsible for random assignment (n = 12 per group) and preparation of the study treatment beverages, which were sequentially numbered according to subject number. The beverages were prepared in a nontrans- parent plastic container and provided in a double-blind fashion.Production of intrinsically labeled milk protein A lactating Holstein cow was selected for the production of intrinsically L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]-leucine labeled milk protein.A constant intravenous infusion of L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine (455 mmol/min) and L-[1-13C]-leucine (200 mmol/min) was applied for 96 h.Milk was collected during and following the infusion period to produce higher and lower labeled milk, respectively.Subse- quently, the milk was processed into milk protein concentrate.56The protein met all chemical and bacteriological speciﬁcations for human consumption.
Experimental protocol At/C2407:45, participants arrived at the laboratory in the overnight postabsorptive state. A catheter was inserted into an antecubital vein for stable isotope amino acid infusion, then a second catheter was subsequently inserted into a dorsal hand vein on the contralateral armfor arterialized venous blood sampling.To obtain arterialized blood samples, the hand was placed in a hot box (60 /C14C) for 10 min before blood sample collection.After taking a baseline blood sample (t = /C0150 min), the plasma phenylalanine, leucine, and tyrosine pools were primed with a single intravenous dose (priming dose) of L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine (3.60 mmol/kg), L-[ring-3,5-2H2]-tyrosine (1.10 mmol/ kg), and L-[1-13C]-leucine (7.19 mmol/kg).
After priming, a continuous intravenous infusion of L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine (0.060 mmol ,kg/C01,min/C01), L-[ring-3,5-2H2]-tyrosine (0.018 mmol ,kg/C01,min/C01), and L-[1-13C]-leucine (0.12 mmol ,kg/C01,min/C01) was initiated and maintained using a calibrated IVAC 598 pump. After resting in a supine position for 90 min, a second arterialized bloodsample was drawn (t = /C060 min).Subsequently, participants initiated the resistance-type exercise intervention (described below).Immediately after the exercise intervention (t = 0 min), an arterialized blood sample was obtained, and a muscle biopsy sample was collected from the vastus lateralis muscle of a randomly selected leg.Subsequently, participants received their experimental drink.Arterialized blood samples were then collected at t = 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, 480, 540, 600, 660, and 720 min in the post- prandial period.Second, third and fourth muscle biopsy samples were collected at t = 240, t = 480, and t= 720 min.
Blood samples were collected into EDTA-containing tubes and centrifuged at 1000g for 15 min at 4 /C14C. Aliquots of plasma were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at /C080/C14C.Biopsy samples were collected using a 5-mm Bergstro ¨m needle custom-adapted for manual suction.Samples were obtained from separate incisions from the middle region of the vastus lateralis, /C2415 cm above the patella and /C243 cm below entry through the fascia, under 1% xylocaine local anesthesia with adrenaline (1:100,000).Muscle samples were freed from any visible non-muscle material, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at /C080/C14C until further processing.For a schematic representation of the primed continuous infusion protocol, see Figure 1 A.Exercise protocol The exercise protocol consisted of a 60-min whole-body resistance-type exercise bout.Subjects performed a 5 min cycling warm up at 100 W with a cadence of 60–80 rpm.
Thereafter, subjects performed four sets of 10 repetitions for the each of the following exer- cises: leg press machine, the leg extension, the lat pulldown, and the chest press (Technogym BV, Rotterdam, Netherlands). The ﬁrstof each exercise was performed at 65% of the subjects 1-RM for 10 reps.Sets 2–4 were performed at 80% of 1-RM until volitionalfatigue under strong verbal encouragement.There were 2-min rest intervals between sets.METHOD DETAILSPlasma and muscle free concentrations Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were analyzed using commercially available kits (GLUC3, Roche, ref.05168791 190, andref.no.K151BZC-3, MSD Insulin Elisa kit, Meso Scale Discovery, Inc.Rockville, Maryland, respectively).Plasma and muscle free amino acid concentrations were measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS; ACQUITY UPLC H-Class with QDa; Waters, Saint-Quentin, France).
For plasma, 50 mL was deproteinized using 100 mL of 10% SSA with 50 mM of MSK-A2 internal standard (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Massachusetts, USA). For muscle tissue, at least 5 mg of freeze-dried tissue was hydrolyzed in 3 mL of 6 M HCl for 12 h at 110 /C14C and dried under a continuous N2-stream.5 mL of 0.1 M HCl was used to reconstitute the hydrolysates after which 50 mL of each protein hydrolysate was deproteinized using 100mL of 10% SSA with 50 mM of MSK-A2 internal standard (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Massachusetts, USA).Subsequently, procedures were identical for plasma and muscle tissue.50 mL of ultra-pure demineralized water was added and samples were centrifuged.After centrifugation, 10 mL of supernatant was added to 70 mL of Borate reaction buffer (Waters, Saint-Quentin, France).In addition, 20 mL of AccQ-Tag derivatizing reagent solution (Waters, Saint-Quentin, France) was added after which the solution was heated for 10 min at 55/C14C.
Of this 100 mL derivative 1 mL was injected and measured using UPLC-MS. Cell Reports Medicine 4, 101324, December 19, 2023 e3Articlell OPEN ACCESS Plasma and muscle free enrichments Plasma and muscle free amino acid enrichments were determined by GC-MS (Agilent 7890A GC/5975C; MSD, Little Falls, DE).Spe- ciﬁcally, internal standards of [U-13C6]-leucine, [U-13C915N]-phenylalanine, and [U-13C915N]-tyrosine were added to the samples.The samples were deproteinized on ice with dry 5-sulfosalicylic acid.Free amino acids were puriﬁed using cation exchange chromatog-raphy (AG 50W-X8 resin, mesh size: 100–200 mm, ionic form: hydrogen; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).The free amino acids were converted to their tert-butyl dimethylsilyl (tBDMS) derivatives with MTBSTFA before analysis by GC-MS.
The amino acid con- centrations were determined using electron impact ionization by monitoring ions at mass/charge (m/z) 302 and 308 for unlabeled and[U- 13C6]-leucine, 336 and 346 for unlabeled and [U-13C915N]-phenylalanine, and 466 and 476 for unlabeled and [U-13C915N]-tyrosine respectively. The plasma and muscle free leucine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine13C and2H enrichments were determined using selective ion monitoring at m/z 302 and 303 for unlabeled and labeled L-[1-13C]-leucine, respectively; m/z 336, 337, and 341 for un- labeled and labeled L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine and L-[ ring-2H5]-phenylalanine, respectively; m/z 466, 467, 468, and 470 for unlabeled and labeled L-[1-13C]-tyrosine, L-[ ring-3,5-2H2]-tyrosine and L-[ ring-2H4]-tyrosine, respectively.Standard regression curves were applied from a series of known standard enrichment values against the measured values to assess the linearity of the mass spec- trometer and to account for any isotope fractionation.
Mixed-muscle tissue analyses Mixed-muscle protein was extracted from 50 mg wet muscle tissue that was freeze-dried. Collagen, blood, and other non-muscleﬁber material were removed from the muscle ﬁbers under a light microscope.The isolated muscle ﬁber mass (approximately8 mg) was weighted and 35 volumes (7 times dry weight of isolated muscle ﬁbers wet:dry ratio) of ice-cold 2% PCA were added.Thereafter, the tissue was sonicated and centrifuged.The protein pellet was washed with 3 additional 1.5 mL washes of 2% PCA, hydrolyzed with 6M HCl at 110 /C14C for 15–18 h, and then dried under a nitrogen steam while heated to 110/C14C.Next, 50% acetic acid solution was added, and the hydrolyzed protein was passed over a cation exchange resin (Dowex AG 50W-X8, 100–200 mesh hydrogen form: Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using 2M NH 4OH.The eluate was dried, and the puriﬁed amino acids were derivatized to their N(O,S)-ethoxycarbonyl ethyl esters.
For the measurement of L-[1-13C]-leucine and L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine, hydrolyzed mixed-muscle protein samples were processed via the same procedures as in the myoﬁbrillar and muscle connective protein ana- lyses described below. Myoﬁbrillar and muscle connective protein analyses Muscle connective and myoﬁbrillar protein-enriched fractions were isolated from 50 to 90 mg of wet muscle tissue by hand homog- enizing on ice using a pestle in a standard (SET buffer: sucrose, EDTA and tris) extraction buffer (10 mLm g/C01).The samples were spun for 15 min at 700 gand 4/C14C.The supernatant was transferred to a separate tube for Western blot analysis.The pellet was washed with 400mL of extraction buffer before vortexing and centrifugation at 700 gand 4/C14C for 10 min.The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with 500 mL ddH2O before vortexing and centrifugation at 700 gand 4/C14C for 10 min.
The supernatant was removed, and 1 mL of homogenization buffer was added and the material was suspended by vortexing before transferring into microtubes con-taining 1.4 mm ceramic beads and Lysing Matrix D (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). The microtubes were vigorously shaken four times for 45 s at 5.5 m s /C01(FastPrep-24 5G, MP Biomedicals) to mechanically lyse the protein network.Samples were then left to rest at 4/C14C for 3 h before centrifugation at 700 gand 4/C14C for 20 min, discarding the supernatant and adding 1 mL of homogenization buffer.The microtubes were shaken for 40 s at 5.5 m s/C01before centrifugation at 700 gand 4/C14C for 20 min.The supernatant was discarded, and 1 mL of KCl buffer was added to precipitate connective proteins overnight at 4/C14C.The next morning, samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 1600 gfor 20 min at 4/C14C.For the myoﬁbrillar isolation the supernatant was transferred to a separate tube.
Then, 3.4 mL EtOH 100% were added, samples were vortexed, left for 2 h at 4/C14C and then centrifuged at 1600g, for 20 min at 4/C14C. Super- natant was discarded and EtOH 70% was added to the pellet, vortexed and centrifuge again at 1600g, for 20 min at 4/C14C.Supernatant was again discarded and the remaining pellet was suspended in 2 mL of 6 M HCl in glass screw-cap tubes and left to hydrolyze over- night at 110/C14C.For the connective isolation, the pellet, containing both immature and mature connective proteins, was mixed with 1 mL KCl buffer and left for 2 h at 4/C14C.The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 1600g for 20 min at 4/C14C, and the supernatant was discarded.To the pellet, 1 mL ddH2O were added, vortexed, left for 2 h at 4/C14C and then centrifuged at 1600 g, for 20 min at 4/C14C.The supernatant was removed and the remaining pellet was suspended in 1 mL of 6 M HCl in glass screw-cap tubes and left tohydrolyze overnight at 110 /C14C.
The hydrolyzed protein was then dried under a nitrogen stream when being heated to 110/C14C. Following hydrolyzation, the free amino acids were dissolved in 25% acetic acid solution, passed over cation exchange AG 50W- X8 resin columns (mesh size: 100–200, ionic form: hydrogen; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), washed 5 times with water andﬁnally eluted with 2 M NH4OH.For measurement of L-[1- 13C]-leucine and L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine, derivatized samples were measured using a GC-C-IRMS (MAT 253; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Bremen, Germany) equipped with DB5MS 30m column (No.122–5532; Agilent) and GC-Isolink monitoring of ion masses 44, 45, and 46.For measurement of L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine, deriv- atized samples were measured using a GC-P-IRMS (MAT 253; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Bremen, Germany) equipped with aDB17MS 60m column with 5m pre-column (No.122–4762; Agilent) and GC-Isolink, monitoring of ion masses 2 and 3.
Standard regression curves were applied from a series of known standard enrichment values against the measured values to assess the line- arity of the mass spectrometer and to account for any isotope fractionation which may have occurred during the analysis. e4Cell Reports Medicine 4, 101324, December 19, 2023Articlell OPEN ACCESS Plasma protein analyses Plasma protein was extracted from basal blood samples by adding 40 mL 20% perchloric acid (PCA) to 360 mL plasma to achieve a ﬁnal concentration of 2%.Samples were centrifuged at 1000 gat 4/C14C for 20 min after which the supernatant was removed.The mixed plasma protein pellet was washed with 3 washes of 2% PCA, after which the supernatant was removed.The protein pellet was hy-drolyzed after adding 6 M HCl by heating at 110 /C14C for 15–18 h.The hydrolyzed protein fraction was then dried under a nitrogen stream while being heated to 110/C14C.
Thereafter, the hydrolyzed mixed plasma protein samples were processed via the same procedures as the muscle tissue analyses. Western blotting A portion of each muscle sample frozen for biochemical analyses was homogenized in seven volumes Tris buffer (20 m MTris-HCL, 5 mMEDTA.10 m MNa-pyrosphospate, 100 m MNaF, 2 m MNa3VO4, 1% Nonident P-40; pH 7.4) supplemented with protease and phos- phatase inhibitors: aprotinin 10 mgm L/C01, leupeptin 10 mgm L/C01, benzamidin 3 m Mand phenylmethylsulphonyl ﬂuoride 1 m M.After homogenization, each muscle extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 g(4/C14C) and sample buffer was added to the supernatant to ﬁnal concentrations of 60 m MTris, 10% glycerol, 20 mg mL/C01SDS, 0.1 m Mdithiothreitol, 20 mgm L/C01bromophenol blue.The su- pernatant was then heated for 5 min at 100/C14C and immediately placed on ice.Immediately before analyses, the muscle extraction sample was warmed to 50/C14C and centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 g[room temperature (RT)].
The total amount of sample loaded on the gel was based on protein content. After a Bradford assay, 30 mg protein were loaded in each lane.With the exception of mTOR, protein samples were run on a Criterion Precast TGX 4–20% gel (Order No.567–1094; Bio-Rad) ±90 min at 150 V (constant voltage) and transferred onto a Trans -blot Turbo 0.2 mm nitrocellulose membrane (Order No.170–4159; Bio-Rad) in 7 min at 2.5 A and 25 V mTOR proteins were run and blotted for 10 min at 2.5 A and 25 V but on a Criterion Precast XT 3–8% Tris-acetate gel (Order No.345-0130; Bio-Rad).Speciﬁc proteins were detected by overnight incubation at 4/C14C on a shaker with speciﬁc antibodies in 50% in PBS Odyssey blocking buffer (Part No.927-40 000; Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) after blocking for 60 min at RT in 50% in PBS Odyssey blocking buffer.
Polyclonal primary phospho-speciﬁc antibodies, anti-phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), anti-phospho-S6K1 (Thr389), anti-phospho-S6K1 (Thr421/Ser424), anti-phospho-rpS6 (Ser235/Ser236), anti-phospho ACC (Ser79) and anti-phospho-4E- BP1 (Thr37/46) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). In addition, anti-mTOR, anti-p70 S6K1, anti- RS6, anti-ACC, anti-Beclin1, anti-LC3b, anti-Atg12, anti-Myostatin and anti-4E-BP1 were also purchased from Cell Signaling Tech- nology.Following incubation, membranes were washed three times 10 min in 0.1% PBS-Tween 20 and once for 10 min in PBS.Next,samples were incubated on a shaker (1 h at RT) with infrared secondary antibodies, donkey anti-rabbit IRDYE 800 (dilution 1:10 000; Cat.No.611-732-127; Rockland Immunochemicals, Pottstown, PA, USA) and donkey anti-mouse IRDYE 800CW (dilution 1:10 000; Cat.No.626–32 212; Li-Cor Biosciences) dissolved in 50% PBS Odyssey blocking buffer.
After a ﬁnal wash step (3 310 min) in 0.1% Tween 20-PBS and once 10 min in PBS, protein quantiﬁcation was performed by scanning on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System(Li-Cor Biosciences).
