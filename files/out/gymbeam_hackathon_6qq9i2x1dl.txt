This secondary analysis of a parallel group randomised trial (regsitered: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03367936 ) assessed whether self-monitoring with feedback (SM þFB) v.
self-monitoring alone (SM) improved diet quality. Adults with overweight/obesity (randomised: SM n251, SM þFBn251; analysed SM n170, SM þFBn186) self-monitored diet, physical activity and weight.Real-time, personalised feedback, delivered via a study-specific app up to three times daily, was based on reported energy, fat and added sugar intake.Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015) scores were calculated from 24-hour recalls.Higher scores represent better diet quality.Data werecollected August 2018 to March 2021 and analysed spring 2022.The sample was mostly female (78 ·9 %) and white (85 ·4 %).At baseline, HEI-2015 total scores and bootstrapped 95 % CI were similar by treatment group (SM þFB: 63 ·11 (60 ·41, 65 ·24); SM: 61 ·02 (58 ·72, 62 ·81)) with similar minimal improvement observed at 6 months (SM þFB: 65 ·42 (63 ·30, 67 ·20); SM: 63 ·19 (61 ·22, 64 ·97)) and 12 months (SM þFB: 63 ·94 (61·40, 66 ·29); SM: 63 ·56 (60 ·81, 65 ·42)).
Among those who lost ≥5 % of baseline weight, HEI-2015 scores improved (baseline: 62 ·00 (58 ·94, 64·12); 6 months: 68 ·02 (65 ·41, 71 ·23); 12 months: 65 ·93 (63 ·40, 68 ·61)). There was no effect of the intervention on diet quality change.Clinically meaningful weight loss was related to diet quality improvement.Feedback may need to incorporate more targeted nutritional content.Key words: Diet quality: Mobile health: Weight loss: Behaviour change Overweight and obesity rates in the USA and across the world are high and continue to rise(1,2).As such, extensive research has been conducted on developing and testing behaviouralinterventions for weight loss.Diet and exercise are recognisedas key components of standard behavioural weight lossprogrammes with the US Preventative Services Task Forcerecommending such multicomponent interventions for adultswith obesity (3).However, many studies explicitly focus goals on energy restriction and low/moderate fat intake.
While nutritionalcounselling in interventions may discuss other aspects of diet,such as increasing fruit intake, it is often couched in terms ofhelping with the energy and fat restriction goals. Fewinterventions report on dietary changes holistically; therefore,it is unclear if and how weight loss interventions affect dietquality.Diet quality represents the healthfulness of an individual ’s overall dietary pattern.Poor diet quality is a major correlate ofprevalent overweight and obesity (4)as well as weight gain over time(5,6).In randomised controlled trials, improvements in diet quality have been shown to relate to weight loss separatefrom the effect of energy restriction (7,8).Diet quality has also been shown to relate to weight loss maintenance post-intervention (9,10).Importantly, diet quality measured using validated instru- ments (e.g.dietary recalls and food frequency questionnaires)and multiple indices (i.e.
Healthy Eating Index, Alternate HealthyEating Index, alternate Mediterranean Diet score and adherenceto the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet) has alsobeen shown to relate to cardiometabolic risk factors other thanweight (4,11)and to chronic disease independent of its effect on *Corresponding author: Lora E Burke, email lbu100@pitt.eduAbbreviations: HEI-2015, Healthy Eating Index 2015.British Journal of Nutrition (2023), 130, 2013 –2021 doi: 10.1017/S0007114523001137 © The Author(s), 2023.

Since weight loss can be difficult to achieve and weight regain is common(14), diet quality change may provide an important additional endpoint for assessing the effectiveness ofinterventions for chronic disease prevention. The provision of personalised dietary feedback may be particularly important for diet quality improvement.In a smallpilot study among participants self-monitoring their diet using anapp-based food diary (i.e.tracking foods as they were eatenthroughout the day), who were not provided dietary feedback, diet quality worsened over 8 weeks.This was in comparison to participants using the Notepad app on the phone or paper-and-pencil methods of self-monitoring who did receive feedback andwho improved diet quality (15).This secondary analysis expands on the potential importance of providing dietary feedback to adults with overweight orobesity that was suggested by the results of the pilot study.
In alarger sample and over 12 months, we assessed the associationbetween diet quality and a mHealth intervention of self-monitoring (via Fitbit food diary) and personalised, automatedfeedback compared with self-monitoring alone. We hypoth- esised that the provision of feedback would result in improved diet quality over self-monitoring alone.We also assessed therelationship between diet quality improvement and weight losswith the hypothesis being that we would observe greater dietquality improvement among those with clinically meaningfulweight loss compared with those without.In addition toestablishing the importance of dietary feedback in a remote,scalable intervention, such an examination might help identifyhow the intervention can be refined for maximal benefit.Methods Study sample The design of SMARTER, a 12-month parallel group randomised controlled trial, as well as the primary outcome of weight loss have been described elsewhere(16–18)(online Supplementary Fig.S1).
Briefly, using randomisation software staff randomised adults with overweight or obesity with equal allocation stratifiedby race and gender to either a group which receivedindividualised feedback messages based on self-monitoringdata (SM þFB) or to a self-monitoring only comparator (SM). Both groups were given energy, fat gram and physical activitygoals.At baseline, all participants attended a one-on-one, 90-minute dietary counselling session with a master ’s level registered dietitian who had prior experience in standard behavioural treatment.Both groups were instructed to weigh themselves daily on a study-provided digital scale, record allfoods and drinks in the Fitbit food diary and wear a Fitbit activitytracker to monitor physical activity.The University of Pittsburghinstitutional review board approved the protocol.Participantswere recruited from the greater Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area(August 2018 –March 2020), and participants provided written informed consent.
Neither assessors nor participants wereblinded to treatment assignment due to the behavioural natureof the intervention. This analysis was conducted in Spring 2022.Dietary feedback messages were delivered to a study-specific smartphone app up to three times daily while physical activityand weight messages were sent 3 –4 times per week and once a week, respectively.Although there was no specific diet quality goal, suggestions to eat better were inherent in the feedbackmessages the intervention group received (e.g.‘A balanced breakfast includes different food groups, for example, wholegrain toast, nut butter, and fruit.’).The type of message participants received was determined by algorithm conditionsdescribed previously (16).Briefly, to select appropriate messages the algorithm used the energy, fat and added sugar intakereported in the Fitbit food diary along with consideration of theprescribed energy and fat goals.
For example, if a participantrecorded foods with fat content >30 % of the fat goal at breakfast, a message suggesting they limit fat for the remainder of the daymay have been sent (e.g. ‘Choose lower fat foods as the day goes on to stay on track with your calorie and fat goal ’).Most of the over 2000 unique dietary feedback messages in the message library focussed on energy, fat and added sugarintake, as well as the importance of self-monitoring foods.Supplementary Table S1provides examples of messages that address each component of the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015).The HEI-2015 aligns with the Dietary Guidelines forAmericans (DGA) 2015 –2020 and was used as the measure of diet quality in this study (19).Importantly, while some compo- nents were never addressed, such as sodium (Na), there weremultiple possible messages addressing other components (e.g.the word ‘fruit ’appears in over 100 unique messages).Measures Demographic characteristics (e.g.
race and ethnicity, income, education) and some clinical characteristics (i.e. blood pressure,high cholesterol, high trigylcerides [TAG] and smoking status)were self-reported at baseline.Height, weight, waist circum-ference and blood pressure were measured by trained staff atbaseline and follow-up and BMI (kg/m 2) was calculated based on weight and height measurements.At-home weight data fromthe WIFI-enabled scale was used in lieu of staff-collecteddata after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA(March 2020).Dietary data were collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months on two separate days (i.e.up to 6 recalls total per participantthroughout the study period) to minimise within-person randomerror.The 6-month time point was selected because other weightloss studies have shown improvement through 6 months andthen weight regain.Dietary intake was assessed at the 12-monthtime point as it was the end of the intervention period.
Dietaryrecalls were collected using the Automated Self-Administered24-hour recall (ASA-24) system managed by the National CancerInstitute (20). ASA-24 performs well compared with interviewer- administered recall(21)with computer prompts imitating the multi-pass method.To minimise the potential for issues with usability, participants completed their first dietary recall while staff members trained in dietary recalls were present to answerquestions.For subsequent recalls, which could be completedremotely, participants could reach out to staff for assistance.2014 J.Cheng et al.HEI-2015 scores were calculated from dietary recalls.The HEI-2015 has demonstrated construct validity, reliability andcriterion validity (22)and is consistent with other dietary indices(23).The HEI-2015 includes nine adequacy and four moderation components.For most components, intake per 1000calories (1000 kcal =4184 kJ) is scored.
Values between the minimum and maximum score are scored proportionally.Component scores are summed to create an HEI total scorewith 100 being the best possible score (19). Because the HEI is density-based, the correlation between HEI diet quality and dietquantity is low, suggesting a desirable independence betweenmeasures (22).The average HEI-2015 score in the general population is 59(24), well below a score of 74 which would satisfy Healthy People 2020 objectives(25).There are various methods of HEI calculation.As the bivariate(26)and multivariate(27)methods require sufficiently large datasets, these methods were not viable for use in oursample.Therefore, HEI-2015 total and component scores werecalculated using the population ratio method as it is recom-mended for the assessment of intervention effects (28).The population ratio method provides a less biased estimate of apopulation ’s mean HEI score than the simple scoring algorithm or mean ratio method (29).
Statistical analysis The distributions of continuous variables were assessed for normality using histograms and normal probability plots. Forcontinuous-type normally distributed variables, comparison ofbaseline characteristics between those with complete data at alltime points and those with missing data at 6 and/or 12 monthswas conducted using pooled variance ttests when group variances were equal (i.e.male waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, education) or separate-variance ttests with the Satterthwaite method approximation of degrees offreedom when group variances were not equal (i.e.female waistcircumference).Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were applied tocompare group-specific distributions when the distribution ofcontinuous-type variables was not normal (i.e.age, BMI andbody fat percentage).Chi-square tests were used to comparedistributions of categorical variables (i.e.
sex, race and ethnicity,employment, household income, self-reported high bloodpressure, high cholesterol and high TAG, smoking status)between those with and without missing dietary data. Allanalyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SASInstitute, Inc.).The population ratio method was used to calculate the mean intake of dietary constituents across all individuals prior toconstructing ratios and scoring the HEI-2015.Bootstrapresampling was utilised to estimate 95 % CI for mean HEI-2015 total and subcomponent scores for each study time point bytreatment group and by clinically meaningful weight loss statuswith 200 bootstrap resamples generated.To test whether therewere differences in HEI 2015 total scores at each timepoint bystudy arm and weight loss categorisation, CI were compared foroverlap.
As recommended, radar plots were used to visualisecomponent scores of the HEI-2015 (19,30).As there was no observed difference in mean weight loss, the primary outcome of the parent study, between study arms ateither 6 or 12 months (17,18); the study arms were combined when assessing the diet quality over time of (1) those achievingclinically meaningful weight loss ( ≥5 % of baseline weight) at the 6-month time point compared with those without clinicallymeaningful weight loss at the 6-month time point and (2) those achieving clinically meaningful weight loss at the 12-month time point compared with those without clinically meaningful weightloss at the 12-month time point. A sensitivity analysis was performed comparing those participants in the SM þFB group who viewed less than the median percentage of FB messages over 12 months comparedwith those who viewed greater than or equal to the median percentage of FB messages.
The percentage of FB messages viewed was calculated as the number of messages vieweddivided by the number of intended messages. For participantscompleting the entire study, the number of messages they weresupposed to receive was 1095 messages (i.e., 3 messages aday×365 days).Results Of the 502 participants enrolled (SM n251; SM þFBn251), 356 were included in this secondary data analysis as retention at 12 months was 78 ·5%(18)and because some participants retained in the study did not contribute dietary data at follow-up.Participants in this complete case analyses ( Table 1 ) were mostly female (78 ·9 %), white (85 ·4 %), middle-aged (median = 51·0 years) and had obesity (median BMI =33·1).Participants with complete dietary data ( n356) who were included in this analysis were defined as having ≥1 dietary recall at all timepoints.
Analysed participants were significantly older (P<0·0001), more likely to identify as white ( P=0·01), more likely to report high blood pressure ( P<0·01), and high cholesterol ( P<0·01) and had higher systolic blood pressure (P=0·04) and lower BMI ( P=0·03) compared with those who were missing dietary data at 6 and/or 12 months. The percentageof participants with complete dietary data did not differ by treatment assignment (SM =67·7% v.S MþFB=74·1 %, chi- square P=0·12).At baseline, mean HEI-2015 total scores and bootstrapped 95 % CI were similar by treatment group (SM þFB: 63 ·11 (60 ·41, 65·24)v.SM: 61 ·02 (58 ·72, 62 ·81)) ( Table 2 ).For both groups, little improvement in HEI-2015 total scores from baseline wasobserved at 6 months (SM þ FB: 65 ·42 (63 ·30, 67 ·20)v.SM: 63 ·19 (61·22, 64 ·97)) or 12 months (SM þFB: 63 ·94 (61 ·40, 66 ·29)v.SM: 63 ·56 (60 ·81, 65 ·42)).
Similarly, changes in component scores were small between groups and across time points.Figure 1 depicts component scores at each time point by treatment group. Among those at 6 months who lost ≥5 % of baseline weight (n130) compared with those who did not ( <5 %), mean HEI- 2015 scores and bootstrapped CI were greater at 6 months (67 ·46 (65·27, 70 ·12)v.6 2·41 (60 ·26, 63 ·94), respectively) ( Table 3 ) despite similar HEI-2015 scores at baseline (62 ·18 (59 ·47, 65 ·31) v.6 2·06 (59 ·77, 63 ·67), respectively).However, by 12 months,Diet quality change in a mHealth intervention 2015 mean HEI-2015 scores were similar by weight loss status ( ≥5% weight loss: 65 ·38 (62 ·87, 67 ·97)v.<5 % weight loss: 62 ·72 (60·28, 64 ·43)).Component scores are presented in Fig.2 for weight loss status at 6 months.Results were similar when assessing weight loss status at 12 months ( n125).
Again, at baseline, there were no differences in HEI-2015 total scores by 12-month weight loss status ( ≥5% weight loss: 62 ·00 (58 ·94, 64 ·12)v.<5 % weight loss: 62 ·17 (60·26, 63 ·59)) (online Supplementary Table S2and Fig. S2).Among those at 12 months who lost ≥5 % of baseline weight compared with those who did not ( <5 %), mean HEI-2015 scores and bootstrapped CI were greater at 6 months (68 ·02 (65·41, 71 ·23) v.6 2·36 (60 ·23, 63 ·98), respectively) with differences slightly attenuated at 12 months (65 ·93 (63 ·40, 68·61)v.6 2·50 (60 ·36, 64 ·41), respectively).
Among SM þFB participants ( n186), the median percentage of feedback messages viewed over 12 months was 50 ·5% .Although CI overlapped, participants who viewed ≥Median % of messages had slightly greater mean HEI-2015 total scores andbootstrapped CI at 6 months (68 ·02 (63 ·98, 71 ·15)) compared with those who viewed <Median % (63 ·04 (61 ·40, 64 ·61)) despite similar baseline scores ( ≥Median %: 62 ·63 (59 ·73, 65 ·28) v.<Median%: 61 ·85 (59 ·66, 63 ·47)) (online Supplementary Table S3and Fig. S3).By 12 months, the difference in the HEI- 2015 total score was smaller ( ≥Median %: 64 ·78 (61 ·05, 67 ·46)v.<Median %: 63 ·42 (61 ·52, 65 ·20)).Discussion Little change in HEI-2015 scores was observed over 12 months in either the SM or SM þFB group.Our results are similar in magnitude to those reported in other interventions providingfeedback remotely.For example, small improvements in dietTable 1.

For categorical variables, P-values were obtained using the chi-square test of independence. For age, BMI and body fat percentage the Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used to assess differences by missingness category because of non-normality identified during visualisation of his tograms and q –q plots.Two-sided P-values are presented.For all other continuous variables, two sample ttests were used to assess differences by missingness category as plots suggested normality.For all continuous variables except female waist circumference, the pooled variance method was used as variances were equal.Separate-variance ttests with the Satterthwaite method approximation of degrees of freedom were used for female waist circumference.* Statistically significant at the P<0·05 level.†Dietary data were missing at 6 and/or 12 months if there were 0 recalls collected at that timepoint.‡The Unemployed category includes participants who were unemployed, retired or disabled.
§Indicates participants who self-reported ‘yes’to a question, ‘Are you of more than one racial/ethnic background? ’.2016 J.Cheng et al.quality ( ∼2 points) have been observed at 6- and 12-month time points in the cellphone-based arm of a behavioural interventiondespite specific emphasis on following the Dietary Approachesto Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern, regular prompts toself-monitor and communication with ‘buddies ’ (31).In a work- place intervention that included automated feedback, 6-, 12- and24-month improvements in HEI-2015 total scores were similarlysmall (2 ·2, 1·8 and 1 ·6 points respectively) (32).Additionally, in an internet-based weight loss intervention with energy and fatgoals, self-monitoring and automated feedback, HEI-2015 totalscores improved by approximately 4 points over 3 months (33).However, as diet quality improvements have been seen to lessenover the course of an intervention (34,35), additional follow-up time might have shown attenuated results.
Limited engagement with digital self-monitoring might have precluded improvement in diet quality in our study. Dietary self-monitoring declined curvilinearly over time with only about halfof days being self-monitored over 12 months on average (36), and the median percentage of feedback messages interventionparticipants viewed over the 12 months was low (18).Such issues with engagement might underly the lack of differences over timeas well as the lack of differences between groups since thenumber of diet-related feedback messages a participant receivesis related to weight loss only indirectly through self-monitoringadherence (37).If self-monitoring can be improved and feedbackbetter received, results might be stronger as evidenced by the fact that we saw a signal towards greater improvement in dietquality among SM þFB participants who viewed more mes- sages.
This aligns with our previously reported results showingthat percentage of feedback messages viewed is related toweight loss (18). The single session with a dietician at baseline in SMARTER may not have been sufficient for inducing diet quality change,and there were no specific goals for altering macronutrientintake, other than fat intake.Many behavioural weight lossprograms such as ours, draw from the Diabetes PreventionProgram (DPP).However, diet quality improvements in the DPPwere small despite a high level of coach contact.This may bebecause only one intervention session directly addressedhealthy eating independent of weight loss (7,38).Indeed, it may be that improvements in diet quality were small in this studybecause there was no explicit focus on altering components ofdiet quality identified by the HEI.In a study in which sessionswere specifically focussed on recommendations from the DGA,the number of sessions attended was positively associated withHEI-2005 scores (35).
Other reasons for the lack of improvement in diet quality in this study may be related to the fact that theintervention targeted individual-level behaviour change only.Multilevel interventions that simultaneously target individual-level and socio-ecological factors may be warranted.Table 2.

95 % CI are based on bootstrapped resamples.Diet quality change in a mHealth intervention 2017 Despite the lack of a significant difference between SM þFB and SM groups, the 5 –6 point improvement from baseline that we observed among participants with clinically meaningfulweight loss at 6 months was similar to what has been suggestedas a likely meaningful difference between groups (28). Our results were similar when assessing weight loss status at 12 months as76·0 % of those who lost ≥5 % of baseline weight at 12 months had already lost 5 % of baseline weight by the 6-monthtime point.While it is important to note a clinically meaningful cut point for improvement in diet quality has not been established andscores from different versions of the HEI (and different indices)are not directly comparable, the relationship we observedbetween weight loss and HEI improvement is broadly similar tothat seen in other studies.
In a small pilot study with a 16-weekintervention period, women who achieved clinically meaningfulweight loss improved HEI-2005 total scores by 8 ·3 points (39).I n both the Weight Optimization Revamping Lifestyle using theDietary Guidelines (WORLD) (35)and Daughters and Mothers Against Breast Cancer (DAMES)(8)studies, which used the HEI- 2005, relationships between change in diet quality and weightloss were also observed. Additionally, among rural breast cancersurvivors who maintained lost weight ( ≥5 % of baseline weight) v.those who did not, there was a 4 ·6-point difference in Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) scores at 18 months (9).Such accumulating evidence of a relationship between diet qualityand weight loss reinforces the need for thorough consideration of diet quality in intervention design and analysis.A scoping review of mobile-based interventions concluded there was inadequate examination of dietary behaviour changeand its relationship to health outcomes (40).
Indeed, a systematic review of the use of the HEI in eighteen studies aimed at weightloss identified limitations in the assessment of diet (41). A major strength of this study is that it is one of the few to explore thisquestion rigorously by using multiple 24-h dietary recalls, whichare less biased than food frequency questionnaires andappropriate calculation of the Healthy Eating Index.Additional strengths of the study include the randomised design,relatively large sample size and the intervention ’s scalability.Limitations There are some limitations to this analysis.Reporting errors cannot be ruled out as recalls were not unannounced, thusreducing one of the main advantages of using dietary recalls (42).Similarly, a little less than half of participants had both a weekdayand weekend dietary recall at baseline with less than a thirdcontributing both a weekday and weekend recall at 6 and 12months.
Most participants contributed two non-consecutiverecalls at baseline with only about half doing so at 6 months and12 months. Collecting data on both weekdays/weekends and onnon-consecutive days may reduce error as weekday eating hasTable 3.

Cheng et al.been shown to differ from weekend eating(43), and consecutive days of recall tend to be correlated(44).A final limitation is that our analysis included only those participants with complete data.Likely those with missing data had little to no improvement indiet quality due to their disengagement with the study.Therefore, had they been included, results might have been attenuated.Conclusions In conclusion, minimal diet quality improvement was observed in this mHealth intervention among participants with overweight and obesity.When there is excessive energy intake, as with those with overweight/obesity, a focus on addressing low scores forrefined grains, added sugars and/or saturated fats might be mostbeneficial to improving diet quality scores for two reasons.First,the general population has particularly low scores on thesecomponents.
Second, as described by Krebs-Smith andcolleagues, focus on these components would lead to improve- ments in all component scores that are density-based because refined grains, added sugars and saturated fats contribute a largenumber of energies (19). In SMARTER, no messages addressed sodium and few addressed grains (refined or whole) or saturatedfat specifically.Therefore, more focussed feedback messagesmight help induce changes in diet quality.Personalisation of features besides feedback, such as delivery or timing, (45)increasing self-efficacy and culturally tailoring nutritional feedback have also been suggested as ways ofincreasing the benefits of remote, personalised interventions (46).However, because diet quality improvement in weight loss trialshas not been extensively explored, components of interventions necessary for producing diet quality improvement remain unclear.
As such, weight loss researchers may consider assessingimprovements in diet quality such that clarity can be achieved.Widening focus when designing interventions to includeimprovement not only for weight and other cardiometabolicoutcomes, but also for health behaviours such as diet quality,may benefit participants having difficulty achieving or main- taining weight loss.
