Results. 100 acne-aficted participants were compared to 101 healthy controls with similar demographics, including age, body mass index, educational level, and smokinghabits, as well as intake of vitamin B12, corticosteroids, and anabolic steroids.However, considerably more participants in the acne group(47%)weretakingwheyproteinsupplementsthaninthecontrolgroup(27.7%)(p �0.0047).Tesignifcanceofthis diference was maintained after multivariate analysis.Conclusion.Tis case-control study provides evidence of a positive as- sociation between whey protein consumption and acne risk.
1.Introduction Acneisadiseaseofthepilosebaceousunitthatistriggeredby androgens.Acnelesionsarecausedbyacombinationoffourprimary pathogenic factors: increased and altered sebumproduction under the control of androgens (increasedsensitivity of the androgens receptors), abnormal keratini- zation leading to comedones, the proliferation of Propio- nibacterium acnes, and release of infammatory mediators into the skin [1, 2].Acne is a complex condition of the pilosebaceous unit that may be exacerbated or alleviated by various factors,includingthedietonemaintains.Tecarbohydrate-richdietstimulates androgen release by increasing the secretion ofinsulin and serum insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) andstimulates forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1)/mammaliantarget of rapamycin complex 1 kinase (mTORC1) pathway, leading to the expression of cytokines, follicular hyper- keratinisation, and increased sebum production [3].

Althoughmilkhasalowglycemicindex,itcanaggravate acnebyincreasinginsulinandinsulingrowthfactor-1(IGF-1)levelsandreleasingcomedogenichormoneslikeestrogen,progesterone, androgen precursors, and 5α-reductase ste- roids [5, 6].Casein and whey proteins are the main proteins of milk.Caseinmakesupabout80%(29.5g/L)ofthetotalproteinin cow’s milk, and whey protein makes up about 20% (6.3g/L)[7].Whey protein is the liquid left over after milk has beencurdled and fltered to remove casein (curds).To convertwhey into protein powder, whey is fltered and dried inmultiple steps.
It is a mixture of globular proteins that arewater-soluble by-products of cheese production, containingfve primary proteins: β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin, gly- comacropeptide,proteasepeptone3,immunoglobulins,and serum albumin, which account for approximately 85% of whey protein [8, 9]. Whey protein supplements are trendy among athletes and bodybuilders.Tey positively afect muscle size,strength, and athletic performance without signifcant ad-verse efects.Additionally, whey is rich in bioactive com-pounds that may reduce disease risk [8].However, someadverseefectsonthekidneyandliverfunctionarepotential,especially if consumption is chronic or without professionalguidance [10].Afewpriorstudiesbasedoncaseseriesanduncontrolled observationalstudiesdiscoveredacorrelationbetweenwhey protein supplements and acne, particularly in athletes who took whey protein.
Tis study aims to investigate the as-sociation between acne and the consumption of nutritionalsupplements, such as whey protein, among Jordanian ath-letes and young adults who attend ftness centers. 2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Study Design.Tis observational case-control study was conducted from June to September 2022.Fitness center at-tendees who participated in the study were interviewed to fllout an anonymous questionnaire about their demographicsand intakeof supplementsduring the previous three months.Tey were then examined for the presence of acne.Partici- pants with acne were considered the cases, and those withoutevidenceofacnewerethecontrols.Anequalnumberofcasesandcontrolswereincluded;allwerefromonegenderandage-matched.Te ethics committee of Jordan University of Sci-ence and Technology approved the study (IRB number 2022/379).Participants and guardians of those under 18years oldverbally consented to participate in the study.2.2.Study Population and Sample.
Protein supplement consumption is common among athletes and young people who seek enhancement of their muscle mass or strength, soour sample was recruited from multiple ftness center at-tendees in Irbid/Jordan. We enrolled 201 males between 14and 43years old, 100 cases of acne versus 101 healthycontrols.2.3.Measurements.In this study, a three-section ques- tionnaire was used to collect data.Te questionnaire wasflled out by researchers using the face-to-face interviewmethod.Te frst section was about the participants’characteristics, including age, educational level, body massindex (BMI), smoking habits, chronic diseases, family his- tory of acne, and factors predisposing to acne, including corticosteroid, vitamin B12, and anabolic steroid intake inthelastthreemonths.Teparticipantsinthesecondsectiondiscussedtheuseofnon-dietaryproteinsupplements(whey,casein, and creatine).
Te duration of use in weeks and thefrequency of intake per week were also recorded, and theconsumption of full-fat milk, skimmed milk, and dairyproducts was also evaluated. Two servings or more wereregarded as signifcant daily consumption.All participantswere then examined for acne; those with acne or who hadbeen on acne treatment were considered cases.Te third section was completed for 100 acne patients, including the duration, site, and type of acne lesions.Te severity of acnewas then calculated using the Global Acne Grading Systemscore as follows: (1–18) mild, (19–30) moderate, (31–38)severe, and (≥39) very severe [11]; however, we considered(≥31) assevere becauseofthe shortageofparticipants inthevery severe category.Te primary outcome measures werecomparing the percentage of participants on diferentprotein supplements, milk, and dairy products.Te sec-ondary outcome was to study the correlation between acneseverity, demographics, and supplement intake.2.4.Statistical Methods.
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). Continuous variables are pre- sented as mean and standard deviation.Frequency andpercentage values were used to present categorical (quali-tative)variables.Descriptiveanalysiswasperformedtoelicitthe percentage, mean, and standard deviation (SD) of the quantitative data.Te chi-square test was used to compare acne and control group values for categorical variables,including participants’ characteristics and non-dietarysupplement intake.Diferences are considered statisticallysignifcantifthe pvalue<0.05andhighlysignifcantifthe p value<0.01.Bivariate signifcant results were entered into multivariate logistic regression.3.Results 3.1.Characteristics of the Participants.Te study included 201 male participants, 100 acne vulgaris patients, and101acne-freecontrols;theiragesrangedfrom14to43years.
Te mean age of the acne group was (22 ±4.52) years, and the meanage ofthe controlgroupwas (23 ±5.07) years.Te agewasalsocomparablewhendividedintointervalswithout signifcant diferences between the two groups. Te twogroups were also similar regarding educational level, bodymass index, smoking, and chronic diseases (hypertension,diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disease).Te intake of cor-ticosteroid, vitamin B12, and anabolic steroids in the lastthree months was not diferent between cases and controls.Ontheotherhand,therewasasignifcantdiferencebetween2 DermatologyResearchandPractice the acne and control groups in terms of family history of acne (p �0.0142); these results are shown in Table 1.3.2.High Intake of Dairy Products.High intake, which was defned in this study as the consumption of two or moreservings of dairy products, was also compared between thetwo groups.Tis includesfull-fat, skimmed, and other dairyproducts (cheese and yogurt).
40% of acne patients andaround 30% of controls consumed high amounts of full-fatmilk; this diference was signifcant (p �0.0356), while the consumption of both skim milk and other dairy product(yogurt and cheese) was not statistically signifcant betweencases and controls. 3.3.Protein Supplement Intake.Around half of all partici- pantsinourstudywereonnon-dietaryproteinsupplements, 59%ofacnepatientsversus42.5%ofcontrols;thisdiference was statically signifcant (p �0.0199); this fnding is shown inTable1.Furtherdetailingthetypeofproteinsupplements,whey protein supplements were the most popular supple-ment, with approximately 74% of protein supplement usersconsuming them; whey supplements were used by 47percent of acne patients and 27.7 percent of the controlgroup.Tis diference was statistically signifcant(p�0.0047).
Te intake of other protein supplement types (casein, whey, and creatine) did not difer signifcantlybetweenthetwogroups.Tedurationofproteinsupplement usagerangedfromoneweektothreeyears,withthemajority of users using supplements for more than three months.Tere was no diference in protein supplement use durationbetweencasesandcontrols.Inaddition,overhalfofthecasesand controls took protein supplements daily, and theirweekly consumption was comparable. Tese results aredisplayed in Table 2.3.4.Acne Assessment and Factors Afecting the Severity.Te face was the most common site of acne in 80 percent ofpatients,followedbythebackin43percent,theshouldersin 28 percent, and the chest in 11 percent.

Multivariate Analysis of Results. Multivariate logistic regression was done for the signifcant bivariate results; the variablesincludedfamilyhistory,proteinsupplementintake,whey protein, and full-fat milk, and this yielded the fol-lowing results.Te odds of having acne were 2.94 (aroundthree times) for participants who consume whey proteincompared to controls (OR: 2.94, CI:1.11–7.82, p�0.03).In contrast, the diference between acne patients and controlsintermsoffamilyhistory,intakeoffull-fatmilk,andproteinsupplementation became insignifcant.Table 3 illustrates these fndings.4.Discussion Tis study aimed to investigate the relationship betweenacne vulgaris and protein supplements.Tis is especially important for athletes and young adults who regularlyconsume concentrated protein preparations to increasemuscle strength and mass.Tis age group is also associatedwith a higher risk of acne.So, it is unclear what efect thesefactors have on acne causation or aggravation.
We studied an equal number of acne patients and healthy controls whose demographics and consumption ofknown acne triggers were matched. A more signifcantproportion of acne patients used whey supplements thancontrol subjects.Chi-square analysis revealed that family history and consumption of full-fat milk diferedsignifcantly; however, multivariate analysis rendered the diference insignifcant.Consequently, our fndings implythat whey supplements afect acne formation.Few previous studies, based on case series and small patient populations, have suggested the acnegenic efect ofwhey protein supplements [12–15].Our results supportedthis potential efect.A recent clinical trial involving a smallnumber of acne patients demonstrated no inferior efect ofwheyproteinsupplementsonacnecountorseverity[16].Incontrast to previous research, our study included a signif- cantlygreaternumberofacnepatientsalongwithcontrolsof the same gender and age range.
Table 4 summarises thepublished studies of the efect of whey protein supplementson acne vulgaris. In this study, the percentages of participants from both groups who consumed whey from dietary sources, specif-cally skim milk, cheese, and yogurt, were very similar.Al-though a more signifcant proportion of acne suferersreported drinking full-fat milk, this diference lost statisticalsignifcancewhenotherfactorswereconsideredinthestudy.Several studies have demonstrated that milk consump- tion leads to an increased risk of acne [5, 17, 18].In girls,total milk intake, low-fat milk intake, and skim milk intakewere associated with acne, but in boys, only skim milk wasassociated with acne.Another 2489-person prospectivecohort study linkedacneto highdairy consumption.Recent case-controlstudieshaverevealedthatthefrequencyofmilkTable2: Comparison of the type, duration, and weekly frequency of protein supplement consumption between cases and controls.

Te potentialassociation between milk consumption and acne risk re-mains contentious.In addition, it is unknown whether theacne-aggravatingimpact ofmilkisrelatedtoitsmanytypes, such as full-fat, low-fat, and skim milk.Or whether the frequency of milk consumption signifcantly afects acnedevelopment and whether milk impacts acne severity.Amore recent meta-analysis to answer these queries foundthatmilkconsumptionwasassociatedwithanincreasedriskof acne and recommended limiting milk consumption forprevention [23].
In milk and its derivatives, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is present, a molecule related to the stimulation ofthe growth and division of epidermal cells, the creation ofsebum, and the elevation of estrogen factors, all of which contribute to the development of acne [4, 5]. Tus, this may be one of the reasons why a high intake of whey proteinproducts is associated with the development of acne lesions.Milk products difer from other carbohydrate- containing diets in that they induce signifcant insulin re-sponses despite their low glycemic index (GI).Milk’sinsulinotropic mechanism is unknown; several studies havefound that reconstituted milk powder and whey have sig-nifcantly lower postprandial glucose, implying that wheyprotein is most insulinotropic and may improve post-prandial blood glucose levels [24, 25].5.Conclusions In conclusion, our fndings add to the evidence of wheyprotein’sassociationwithacnevulgaris,mostlikelyduetoitsinsulinotropic efect.
Tese fndings assist athletes, derma- tologists, and general physicians in understanding the de- velopment of acne after the initiation of whey supplementsand deciding to stop or encourage their discontinuation,particularly in cases of treatment failure or resistance.Considering that our study has limitations due to its cross-sectionaldesignandthesmallnumberofpatients,theresultsmust be validated by future prospective studies on a largernumber of patients, combined with the measurement ofinsulin and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels.
