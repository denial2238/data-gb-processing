Conclusion Theresults ofthisthree-month BCP supplementation study using objective measurement parameters indogs withnaturally occurring OAdemonstrate anefficacy, suggesting the therapeutic useofBCP incanine OApatients anddemonstrating therelevance ofthiscolla- genhydrolysat eformulation forthetreatment ofOAinhuman patients aswell. Introduction Inhuman medicine, osteoarthritis isajoint disease with increasing global prevalence, espe- cially among theelderly [1].The useoftranslational animal models isavaluable strategy inthe process ofdeveloping therapy options.Companion animals likedogs provide avalid model forspontaneously occurring joint OAand pain medication [2],sotheresults ofstudies in these species canadvance both veterinary and human medicine.Due totheanatomical and pathological commonalities between dogs and humans, spontaneously occurring osteoarthritis (OA) indogs isafrequently used model intranslational medicine forhuman OA[3–5].
Spon- taneous OApathology indogs and humans islargely similar, and thecanine model isgood for evaluating theeffectiveness ofdifferent treatment options [6]. Inveterinary medicine, itisknown that avery high number ofdogs suffer from OA, a chronic progressive disease that usually occurs inolder ageand hasaprevalence ofupto80% indogs older than eight years, with overweight and obesity increasing therisk ofthedisease [7,8].Although thedisease canoccur inyounger dogs, itisusually diagnosed when itreaches amore advanced stage with increasingly obvious clinical signs such asstiffness, lameness, and unwillingness toexercise, jump orclimb [9].OAischaracterized bylossofarticular cartilage inthesynovial joints, subchondral bone sclerosis, synovitis, and thickening ofthecapsule.The disease canbedefined asapainful condition that affects theanimal’s well-being.Non-surgical treatment options forOAarecurrently limited mostly topain management, which canalleviate symptoms butnotactcausative.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) arefrequently used fortheir anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects inOA, despite theincidence ofadverse effects such asgastrointestinal problems, renal insufficiency, anorexia, lethargy and even death [10]. Prolonged administration ofNSAIDs inolder dogs, which OA patients usually are,isnotrecommended [11].Inasystematic literature review, Innes etal.(2010) evaluated information ontheefficacy and safety oflong-term useofNSAIDs indogs to treat OA[12].They concluded that long-term useisassociated with reduced safety, although there isalack ofrobust data inthisrespect forarelevant number ofdogs.Amore recent evalu- ation from 2019 [13] concluded that veterinarians under-report adverse events associated with NSAIDs and that owners should bebetter informed about therisks associated with long-term NSAID useintheir dogs.Other, lessfrequently used medications forcanine OApatients also appear tohave limitations.
Miles etal.(2020) found intheir study that both tramadol and gabapentin canimprove weight bearing indogs diagnosed with OAand appear tobesafe for short-term useinolder patients, butconcluded that therelatively high incidence ofundesir- able effects insome patients may outweigh thebenefits [14]. Another substance, bedinvetmab, isacanine immunoglobulin G2(IgG2) monoclonal antibody (mAb) intended toalleviate pain inOApatients.Astudy conducted bythemanufacturer showed significant beneficial effects when CBPI wasused inatreatment and placebo group [15].However, Kronenberger (2023) evaluated theexisting studies onthisdrug and concluded that they provide only inconclusive evidence ofshort-term safety and long-term efficacy [16].Pacher etal.(2020) sawsome PLOS ONECollagen peptides inosteoarthitis PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03083 78September 19,2024 2/18Data Availabilit yStatement: Allrelevant dataare within thepaper anditsSupport ingInformation files.

Inaddition topurely treating pain and alleviating symptoms without affecting theprogres- sive nature ofOA, several drugs have been investigated aspotential structure-modifying OA drugs (SMOADs). SMOADs include numerous nutraceuticals, defined assupplementary feed items that serve aspecific preventive orcurative purpose (between "nutrition" and "pharma- ceuticals") and areconsidered safe forconsumption without side effects [19, 20].SMOADs such aspolysulfated glycosaminoglycans orhyaluronic acid aim todelay disease progression orrepair OAlesions inaffected joints rather than justalleviate thesymptoms [21, 22].How- ever, noevidence frominvivo trials shows that these drugs canachieve these goals [23].
Stud- iesinvestigating theeffect ofnutraceuticals such asgreen-lipped mussel extract, chondroitin sulfate, curcumin orblackcurrant leafextract onOAinpets show promising effects insome cases butalso provide contradictory orunsatisfactory results inclinical trials that lack consis- tent statistical significance orhave aninadequate study design [24–29]. Omega-3 fatty acids (n3FA) with adefined concentration ofeicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) incombination with a defined dose ofvitamin Earetheonly substance group listed inEURegulation 2020/3544 to support joint metabolism inOAindogs and cats.Roush etal.(2010) reported that supplemen- tation with n3FA from fishoilimproved weight bearing, atleast intheshort term, asmeasured inaforce-plate study indogs with osteoarthritis [30].Fritsch etal.(2010) found that n3FA fish oileffectively reduced pain medication indogs with OA[31].
Specific bioactive collagen peptides (BCP) areanother type ofnutraceutical investigated in vitro and invivo inseveral species. The mode ofaction ofBCP supplementation complements thealleviating effects ofother nutraceuticals bystructurally improving affected tissue and slowing disease progression.Collagen peptides arecharacterized byalowmolecular weight and high content ofproline and hydroxyproline, resulting instrong resistance tointestinal digestion, increased transport efficiency through theintestinal barrier and consequently, enhanced bioavailability [32–34].Collagen-derived peptides have been shown toaccumulate incartilage tissue, where they canstimulate chondrocytes tosynthesize extracellular cartilage matrix molecules and counteract progressive tissue degeneration [35–39].Invitro studies with canine chondrocytes showed that thebiosynthesis ofcartilage matrix molecules increased sig- nificantly after exposure tospecific collagen peptides.
Inaddition, asignificant down-regula- tion ofinflammatory cytokines and degenerative matrix metalloproteases indicated that the cartilage metabolism ofcanine chondrocytes isdirectly influenced byBCP [40]. Beneficial effects ofBCP have also been demonstrated inhorses with OA[41].McAlindon etal.(2011) confirmed apositive effect oforally administered specific BCP onjoint cartilage inhuman patients with mild OA, asmeasured bythediagnostic gold standard ofmagnetic resonance imaging [42].Inacontrolled, randomized study ofyoung, physically active adults, BCP sup- plementation also effectively reduced activity-related knee joint discomfort [43].Thus, oral BCP isapromising nutraceutical forjoint health inhumans and dogs.Investigating thepostu- lated positive effects indogs canhelp toestablish thissubstance inveterinary and human med- icine and optimize thetreatment ofOA.
Aspreviously mentioned, animal models are routinely used forOAresearch, with dogs being oneoftheestablished and recommended models [5,44–48], partly duetotheir greater anatomical similarity tohumans including artic- ular cartilage thickness [49]. They arealso valued asanearly ideal species forthetranslational study ofhuman OAbiomarkers [50].Since dogs with OAcanserve asamodel fordegenera- tivejoint disease inhumans, theBCP effects arelikely tobetransferable tohuman medicine.PLOS ONECollagen peptides inosteoarthitis PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03083 78September 19,2024 3/18 Reviews ofnutritional treatment protocols indogs with chronic OAfound that published studies vary indesign and quality, ultimately leading toalack ofsystematically developed evi- dence foroptimal nutritional management ofOAindogs [28, 51].This may bedue, atleast in part, tothemethodology used insome oftheanimal trials.
Meaningful, valid and reliable mea- sures ofpain treatment arechallenging even inself-evaluation studies inhumans, inpart due tothecomplex, multidimensional, sensory and emotional nature ofpain [52]. Inparticular, when using questionnaires, itmust beanticipated that placebo effects ofcaregivers may distort theresults instudies with companion animals [53].Inthiscontext, a"desirability bias" must also beconsidered [54], allthemore sobecause oftheowner-patient axis.Astudy design should therefore aim toinclude notonly aplacebo group butobjective methods totesttheeffi- cacy ofdifferent preparations with postulated positive effects onjoint cartilage.
Inthisdouble-blind, placebo-controlled field study named CANIS (Canine Arthrosis Nutritional Intervention Study), weinvestigated theeffects ofa12-week supplementation with specific BCP incontrast toacombination ofn3FA and vitamin Eonthegaitand activity ofcli- ent-owned dogs with spontaneously occurring OAwhile also assessing pain and theperceived quality oflifebyowners. The aim wastogain valuable information—also forhuman OA patients—by applying asystematic study design inatranslational canine model.Methods Allprocedures and protocols were conducted inaccordance with theguidelines oftheProtec- tion ofAnimals Actand thestudy wasapproved inwritten format bytheresponsible commit- teeforanimal welfare oftheVeterinary Faculty, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich (reference number 192-11-11-2019) between 2017 and 2021.
Dietary supplements Three different supplements (Table 1)were used inthistrial: i)Commercially available Bioac- tiveCollagen Peptides (PETAGILE1,GELITA AGEberbach, Germany). These arederived from aspecial hydrolysis ofpredominantly type Iporcine collagen, resulting inamean molec- ular weight ofapproximately 6kDa.They arecharacterized bythemolecular weight fraction and amino acid sequence.BCPs have ahigh safety profile and areclassified asasafe food by theEuropean Food Safety Authority [55].ii)Asupplement named n3FA containing 19.5% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 12.6% EPA (both from Denk Ingredients, BIOMEGA Tech F 18:12 PVS), and vitamin E(Vitamin E50% CWD, Nutrilo GmbH, Cuxhaven, Germany), selected astheonly option under Commission Regulation (EU) 2020/354 [56] forthe"support ofjoint metabolism inosteoarthritis" nutritional purpose.
iii)The supplement without active ingredients contained cellulose (feed cellulose, Phrikolat Drilling Specialties GmbH, Hennef, Germany) combined with maltodextrin (C*Dry, Cargill Haubourdin SAS, Haubourdin, Table 1.Compositio n[%] ofthethree supplement sused inthis study.

Allthree supplements were mixed with fisharoma (3.8% inPLA and BCP, 1.4% inn3FA, Symrise AG, Holzminden, Germany) tomask thenatu- ralodor ofthefish-derived n3FA product and tomake them identical inappearance. Allsup- plements consisted ofafine white powder and were packaged inready-to-use pouches labeled only with acode and feeding instructions.The identical appearance ofthecontent allowed for double-blind use, i.e.,neither thesupervising veterinarians northedog owners knew which supplement each dog received atthetrial.The supplements were dosed according tobody weight (BW).The BCP dosage wasbased onstudies byOesser etal.(2007) inmice [57] and results from field studies indogs [40, 58,59]with 240±95mg BCP/kg BW.Inthen3FA group, thedogs received 700±115mg n3FA/kg BW combined with�2mg ofvitamin E/kg BW, fol- lowing regulation EG2020/354 recommendations [56].
Dogs inthePLA group received 240±50mg ofthecellulose mixture perkgBW.The trial duration was12weeks, with daily oral administration oftherespective supplement together with thedog’s regular meal (white powder mixed with water and stirred into theregular feed). The patients were allocated tothe coded and therefore blinded supplements, i.e.study groups, according totheorder inwhich they entered thestudy.The study unblinding occurred after completion ofthestatistical evalu- ation ofallresults.Patients Forty-one privately owned dogs previously diagnosed with chronic OA(�3months) byavet- erinarian, without assessment ofanyprimary causes, were randomly assigned totheBCP, n3FA orPLA group.Adult dogs (>1year) weighing between 10and 60kgwere eligible for thestudy ifthey were notdiagnosed with anyother diseases requiring pain medication in addition toOA.
Medications such asanalgesics, corticosteroids ornutraceuticals fororthope- dicapplications hadtobediscontinued atleast 6weeks prior toenrolment toallow forpartici- pation inthestudy. Participation wasnotpossible incases where themedication could notbe discontinued duetotheseverity ofthecondition.During thestudy period, pain medication wasallowed foruptotwoconsecutive days foracute and severe pain ofanycause ("emergency medication").Using analgesics formore than 2days ledtoexclusion from thestudy.The own- erswere asked nottochange thedog’s diet during thestudy period.The data ofalldogs that completed thestudy arelisted inTable 2.Gait analyses Gait analysis data wasrecorded atbaseline (T0) and after 12weeks ofdaily supplementation (T12) toassess theseverity ofOAsymptoms based onweight-bearing parameters.The dogs were examined onahorizontal treadmill embedded inaplatform with twoseparate belts and four integrated piezoelectric force plates inanidentical manner atboth T0and T12.
The ground reaction forces (GRF) ofallfour limbs were recorded simultaneously during walking. The speed wascontrolled bysoftware insteps of0.02 m/s (Simi Reality Motion Systems GmbH).The velocity wasadjusted individually foreach dog and gaitand kept constant atT0 and T12.Atleast seven valid steps perlimb and evaluation were analyzed using data collection software (Vicon Nexus, Vicon Motion Systems, Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom; QuadruPe- dLocomotion, in-house software ofLudwig-Maximilians-Un iversita ¨tMu¨nchen).The parame- terspeak vertical force (PVF, %BW), vertical impulse (VI, %BW*s)and stance duration (DSP, %ofstep) ofthevalid steps ofeach limb and dog were calculated and summed asaver- agevalues atT0and T12.The limb affected byOAwasdefined atT0using these parameters together with information from each dog’s medical history.

Forallaveraged parameters (PVF, VI,DSP), theabsolute (Δ)and relative difference (RPD) between T12 and T0wascalculated forboth theaffected and thecontralat- erallimb.Inaddition, asymmetry index ofPVF and VI(SIPVF, SIVI) wascalculated forthe affected limb pair asreported elsewhere [60]: SI¼ABS 200∗PVFcontra PVFaff: PVFcontraþPVFaff� � with ABS =absolute amount, PVFcontra =PVF contralateral fore- orhindlimb, and PVFaff =PVF affected fore orhindlimb.Questionnaire The owners were asked tocomplete aquestionnaire ontheir perception ofthedog’s symptoms atT0and T12.Itincluded apreviously validated pain assessment tool, thevalidated Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI) [61].
The CBPI provides asummed score oftenquestions onpain interference with specific movements, quality oflife(QoL) and theestimated total pain ona visual analog scale (VAS; continuous slide control from 0–10 cmwith 0=nopain and 10=most extreme pain). The relative change inCBPI scores between T12 and T0wasused to quantify thesupplementation effects.Accelerometry The dogs wore anaccelerometer onaspecial collar (Actical©,Respironics, Phillips Healthcare, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) fortwoweeks prior totheT0and T12 examination.The Acti- cal©data wasread and processed using theaccompanying software (Actical™ software, version 3.10.0001, Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.).The total daily activity data wasaveraged over thecomplete days ofthetracking period (phases ofincomplete recording, e.g., onthefirst and lastdayofwearing thetracker, were identified and excluded from theanalysis).The rela- tivedifference between each dog’s T12 and T0values wascalculated tocompare thegroups.
Allparticipants, i.e.,investigators and dog owners, were only unblinded once alldata was available and thestatistical analysis completed.Table 2.Breed, age, gender, and body weight ofdogs with osteoarth ritis participatin ginthestudy (mean±SD).

The statistical analysis wasperformed using IBM1SPSS1Statistics software version 29.0. As theShapiro-Wilk testshowed, thevarious metric parameters were notnormally distributed.Therefore, only statistical measures were used without assuming anormal distribution.First, thedata were summarized bycalculating themean, standard deviation, median and range (min and max).Box and whisker plots were used topresent thedata graphically (outliers were marked ascircles).Tostatistically compare thedata oftheaffected limb with thecontralateral limb, weused thegeneralized linear model (GLM) intherepeated measurements variation (= generalized estimating equations—GEE).Within theGLM, thedistribution ofthedependent variable wasspecified asordinal orgamma (only positive values inthecase ofmetric data), and logwasused asthelink function.Toanalyze theeffect ofsupplementation, theabsolute difference (Δ)and relative difference (RPD; in%)between T12 and T0were calculated for each parameter.
Within thegroups, theresults oftheaffected limb and thecontralateral limb were analyzed forsignificant differences using GEE. The GLM wasused tocompare theSIPVF and SIVI ofthethree groups.Inaddition, theabsolute and relative differences between the affected and unaffected limbs within each group were tested against zero (=noeffect) using theOne-Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test.The symmetry indices were also tested with the One-Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test against acut-off of9(SIPVF) or10(SIVI), according toWagmeister etal.(2021) [60].The Kruskal-Wallis testwith Bonferroni post hocpairwise comparison waschosen toanalyze theowners’ questionnaire data.Toanalyze theactivity data, theresults foreach dog were first categorized asdecrease, increase ornochange inactivity level after 12weeks ofsupplementation.Cross tabulation and Somers’ Dforordinal data were used toanalyze these categorical data.Ap-value<0.05 wasconsidered significant.
After the formal analysis ofallresults, theallocation ofthedogs tothethree study groups was unblended. Results Ofthedogs enrolled inthestudy, 10were excluded forthefollowing reasons: skin problems (1 xPLA; 1xBCP); gastrointestinal problems (2xn3FA); malignant tumor requiring pain medi- cation (1xBCP); unknown (2xPLA; 1xBCP; 2xn3FA).Thirty-one dogs completed the study (Table 2).The ageofthedogs atT0didnotdiffer significantly between thesupplementation groups (p=0.747).The starting and end weights also showed nosignificant differences between the groups (p=0.413 and p=0.094, respectively).The acceptance ofallsupplements wassuffi- cient; thedogs fully consumed thesupplements added totheregular diet.Gait Before thestart ofthethree-month supplementation phase (T0), thegaitanalysis parameters PVF, VIand DSP showed lower values fortheOA-affected limbs than fortheunaffected con- tralateral limbs (Table 3).The eligibility ofthethirty-one dogs wasconfirmed based onthese results.
Asexpected, there were nosignificant differences between T0and T12 forallthree parame- tersintheunaffected limbs (S1and S2Tables). Therefore, only theaffected limbs aredetailed inthefollowing presentation oftheresults: InthePLA group, there wasnosignificant effect onPVF (Fig 1;p=0.809), VI(Fig 2;p=0.578) and DSP (p=0.946) asmeasured by Δ,i.e.,the differences between T0and T12.The Δcalculated forthedogs ingroup n3FA showed nosig- nificant difference between thetwotime points: themeasured values forPVF and DSP atT0 PLOS ONECollagen peptides inosteoarthitis PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03083 78September 19,2024 7/18 and T12 were very similar (p=0.972).Inthisgroup, VIincreased slightly butwasnotstatisti- cally significant (p=0.273).Ontheother hand, there wasasignificant increase in ΔforPVF in theBCP group compared totheunaffected limbs (p=0.015).
BCP supplementation resulted inasignificant increase in ΔVIfrom T0toT12 (p=0.004), while ΔDSP increased only numerically (p=0.312). When comparing theRPD percentages inthegaitparameters oftheaffected and theunaf- fected limbs, thePLA group showed adecrease, i.e.,clinical deterioration, inallthree parame- tersmeasured intheaffected limb during the12-week period, which wassignificant forPVF (Fig 3),close tosignificance forVI(p=0.072), ornotsignificant (DSP).Inthen3FA group, there wasatrend towards statistical significance concerning theincrease inPVF (p=0.163) butnochanges inRPD forVI(p=0.703) and DSP (p=0.617).Ontheother hand, there wasaTable 3.Compar ison ofthegait parameters peak vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI) and duration ofstance phase (DSP) between theaffected and unaffecte d limbs before thestart ofthesupplemen tation phase (T0).Due tothedifferent weight deposit ion, thedata oftheforelimbs and hind limbs were analyzed separately.

The dogs’ gaitwasexamined onahorizontal treadmill with integrated piezoelectric force plates. In addition, thevalidated CBPI, determined bythedogowners atthebeginning andendofthe study using aquestionnaire, andactivity measurements with accelerometers were evaluated.Clearly defined, blinded and placebo-controlled systematic studies areneeded toassess pos- sible beneficial effects ofthenutritional supplement BCP.The useofcanine patients diagnosed with OAinresearch, applying clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria aswell asmaxi- mally objective assessment methods, may bevaluable asatranslational model forhuman OA patients.Inthisstudy, dogs with OAdiagnosed byaveterinarian and with abnormal gait parameters ofatleast onelimb atT0were included.Ontheother hand, participation wasnot possible incases where themedication could notbediscontinued foratleast 4.5months (study duration plus wash outperiod before itsstart) duetotheseverity ofthecondition.
Only dogs which didnotdepend onmedication ornutraceuticals were eligible forthestudy. Conse- quently, theseverity ofOAcanbecategorized asmild tomoderate.Gait The force plate measurements onatreadmill were chosen asamore objective method than ques- tionnaires forowners [67–69].They showed partially significant improvements intheevaluated gaitanalysis parameters VI,PVF, andsymmetry indices askinetic measures, andDSP, deter- mined intheaffected andcontralateral limbs indogs after 12weeks oforalBCP intake.Apositive value forthedifference Δbetween T12 andT0indicates animprovement oftheparameter atT12, while negative values indicate adeterioration oftherespective parameter.Intheunaffected limbs ofallthree supplementation groups, thedifference forallgaitparameters wasclose tozero and showed nosignificant change between T0andT12.
The VIwassignificantly increased only inthe affected limb oftheBCP group, indicating thattheaffected legwasmore heavily loaded after three months ofBCP supplementation. The improvement inapplied pressure, measured asthe relative difference inPVF, wasonly significant intheaffected limb ofthedogs intheBCP group.The increase between T0andT12 washighly significant.This development differed significantly from thatinthePLA placebo group.There wasnochange intheDSP ineither thePLA orn3FA group, while theparameter showed anumerical increase intheBCP group.InthePLA group, all measured parameters tended todeteriorate, asistobeexpected inaprogressive disease such as OAafter three months.This trend wasnotobserved inthen3FA group, where nosystematic dif- ferences were found between thetwotime points.This suggests that thecombination ofeffective substances approved byEUlegislation tosupport joint metabolism inOAindogs andcats, appears tohave slowed disease progression inthisstudy.
Orally administered collagen hydrolysates areabsorbed (humans: [70]; dogs: [71]) and can bedetected intissues such ascartilage after administration ofthelabeled product [72]. The pronounced resistance tointestinal digestion, high transport efficiency and consequently high bioavailability isassociated with thelowmolecular weight and high proportion ofproline and hydroxyproline incollagen peptides [32–34].The twomain modes ofaction oforally adminis- tered collagen peptides arethestimulation ofextracellular matrix molecules synthesis, espe- cially proteoglycans, and thedown-regulation ofinflammatory cytokines and degenerative matrix metalloproteases.This suggests that optimal efficacy ofcollagen peptide administration PLOS ONECollagen peptides inosteoarthitis PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03083 78September 19,2024 11/18 may require that acertain degree ofOAisnotexceeded intheaffected joint(s) ofthepatient.
Early intervention, ifnotpreventive administration offunctional collagen peptides such as BCP inpredisposed orpotentially affected individuals (chondrodystrophy, trauma, increased stress from sport, overweight and obesity etc.) istherefore recommended tomaintain joint health and functionality foraslong aspossible, asalso suggested byKwatra (2020) [73]. This is increasingly important intheaging petand human population with ahigh prevalence ofover- weight and obesity [74, 75].Itisimportant tonote that collagen hydrolytes arenotahomogenous group ofpeptides.The composition and characteristics, and thus themode ofaction and efficacy asanoral thera- peutic agent forOA, areinfluenced bythetissue from which thematerial isderived and bythe processing steps such ashydrolysis method and time, pH, temperature and filtration, resulting indifferences inthemolecular sizeand amino acid pattern oftheproduct [76–79].
Therefore, theresults ofonestudy arenotnecessarily transferable, especially ifdifferent active substances, i.e.,differently produced collagen hydrolytes, areused. Inthisstudy, examination ofthegaitofdogs with naturally occurring OAonatreadmill equipped with force plates clearly showed positive effects ofBCP, which significantly mitigated and alleviated clinical signs oftheprogressive disease.This safe oral nutritional supplement hasimpressively shown properties superior totheonly nutrient combination approved by European legislation forsuch use.This systematic, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in dogs with naturally occurring OAdiagnosed byveterinarians, using theobjective parameter of weight-bearing measuring, demonstrated thesuperior efficacy ofBCP supplementation tothe approved combination ofomega-3-fatty acids with vitamin Einaclinical setting.
This type of study isnecessary totranslate theresults ofinvitro studies and studies insmall animal models with induced OAinto practically relevant applications. Questionnaire After 12weeks ofsupplementation, QoL washigher inthePLA group and more pronounced intheBCP group.Inthen3FA group, nochanges were noted bythepatients’ caregivers.The improvement inQoL, asassessed bytheowners using thevalidated CBPI, wassignificantly higher intheBCP group than then3FA group and numerically higher than inthePLA group.Nosignificant differences were found inpain scores ontheCBPI.Aworsening ofclinical signs such aspain, would have been conceivable after thethree-month trial period.However, this wasnotobserved inanyofthethree groups.Even though themethod ofasking owners about their perception ofsigns intheir dogs isknown tobesubjective and possibly imprecise [80], theclear improvement inQoL intheBCP group isremarkable.
The CBPI pain interference score wasfound nottobeassociated with owner response bias and istherefore recommended asaclinical outcome measure forchronic pain and pain-related disability indogs with OA [81]. Thus, even ifacertain placebo effect hastobeconsidered, asdetected inthePLA group, theimprovement wassignificantly more pronounced intheBCP group.The factthat themore objective treadmill measurements also showed themost significant overall improvement in thepatients supplemented with BCP supports thequestionnaire’s positive results.However, therelatively short supplementation period may nothave resulted inanoticeable improve- ment inallclinical signs typically seen inOA.Further longitudinal studies examining thepro- gression ofOAand thebeneficial effects ofBCP onthecartilage arewarranted.Accelerometry The measurement ofdaily activity atthebeginning and end ofthesupplementation period using accelerometers showed nosignificant differences between thegroups.
The method itself PLOS ONECollagen peptides inosteoarthitis PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03083 78September 19,2024 12/18 isknown tobedemanding and dependent onthesystem used and thefrequency ofread-outs butisnonetheless recommended [82]. One ofthereasons fortheoverall lowstatistical effect forthisparameter isthehigh degree ofindividual variation atboth time points, independent ofthegroup.Ithasalso tobetaken into account, that inmost canine OApatients, free activity islikely tobelimited induration and intensity bytheowner.Inparticular, older dogs with known medical conditions may bewalked forshorter periods and onaleash instead ofbeing allowed torunfree.Inaddition, theowners were asked nottochange their dog’s exercise schedule toomuch during thestudy sothat wecould detect changes inspontaneous orvolun- tary activity.Thus, thedogs may nothave hadtheopportunity toengage inmore voluntary activity because theowners setthetime forthewalks.
Therefore, itislikely that accelerometry could notdetect more subtle effects inclient-owned dogs inthelimited time frame ofthe study. Conclusion Oral BCP supplementation over arelatively short period of12weeks cansignificantly improve theclinical signs ofnaturally occurring OAindogs.The effect ofBCP wassignificantly greater than that ofn3FA and vitamin E,which iscurrently theonly nutritional strategy legally approved toimprove OAindogs.This isproof oftheefficacy ofthenon-invasive and safe treatment option with BCP indogs and should also focus attention ontheuseoforal BCP sup- plementation infeline and especially human OApatients.The present study showed impres- sively that theclinical signs ofnaturally occurring canine OAwere notonly stopped but improved byusing objective methods after 12weeks oforal BCP supplementation.
Given the benefits and safety ofBCP supplementation aswell asthelack ofknown undesirable effects, early onset, long-term treatment with BCP inhuman, petand equine OApatients seems advis- able. However, longitudinal studies and trials investigating thepossibility ofdelaying oreven preventing theonset ofOAbyoral BCP supplementation areneeded.Supporting information S1Table.Absolute difference (Δ)ingait analysis parameters ofaffected and unaffected limbs between thesecond (T12) and first (T0) examination, grouped bysupplementation (absolute difference; median [min; max]).(DOCX) S2Table.Relative difference [%] ingait analysis parameters ofaffected and unaffected limbs between thefirst (T0) and second (T12) examination (%;median [min; max]).(DOCX) S3Table.Probability oferror (p)forthesymmetry indices ofpeak vertical force and verti- calimpulse concerning thethreshold value of10(SIPVF) and 9(SIVI), respectively.(DOCX) Acknowledgmen ts Wethank allparticipants who volunteered forthisstudy.
