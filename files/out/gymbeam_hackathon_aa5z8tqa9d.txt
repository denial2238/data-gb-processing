Increases in iron during ischaemia or immediately after reperfusion are associated with detrimental effects on left ventricular (LV) function. The safety and applicability of iron during or immediately after reperfusion of AMI in anaemiaare not known.We aimed to study the safety and ef ﬁcacy of iron supplementation within 1 h or deferred to 24 h after reper- fusion of AMI by analysing LV function and infarct size.Methods and results In a mouse model of moderate blood loss anaemia ( n=6–8 mice/group), the effects of iron supple- mentation (20 mg iron as ferric carboxymaltose per kg body weight) within 1 h and deferred to 24 h after ischaemia/reperfusion were assessed.Cardiac function was analysed in vivo by echocardiography at baseline (Day 3) with and without anaemia, after AMI (24 h), and after administration of intravenous iron.Anaemia was characterized by iron de-ﬁciency and a trend towards increased haemolysis, which was supported by increased plasma free-haemoglobin [sham vs.
anaemia ( n= 8/group): P<0.05]. Anaemia increased heart rate, LV end-diastolic volume, stroke volume, and cardiac output, while LV end-systolic volume remained unchanged at baseline.Superimposition of AMI deteriorated global LV function,whereas infarct sizes remained unaffected [sham vs.anaemia ( n= 6/group): P= 0.9].Deferred iron supplementation 24 h after ischaemia/reperfusion resulted in reversal of end-systolic volume increase and reduced infarct size [% of area at risk: sham vs.anaemia + iron after 24 h; ( n= 6/group); 48 ± 7 vs.38 ± 7; P<0.05], whereas administration within 1 h after reperfusion was neutral [sham vs.anaemia + iron; ( n= 6/group); 48 ± 7 vs.42 ± 8; P= 0.56].Moreover, iron application after reperfused AMI showed unaltered mortality compared with sham.Conclusions Iron supplementation 24 h after reperfusion of AMI is safe and reversed enlargement of end-systolic volume after AMI resulting in increased stroke volume and cardiac output.
This highlights its potential as adjunctive treatment in anae- mia with ID after reperfused AMI. Time point of iron application after reperfusion appears critical.Keywords Iron de ﬁciency; Anaemia; Acute myocardial infarction; Drug safety Received: 20March 2021 ; Revised: 12September 2021 ; Accepted: 19September 2021 *Correspondence to: Christian Jung, Department of Cardiology, Pulmonology, and Vascular Medicine, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University of Duesseldorf, Moorenstr.5,40225 Düsseldorf, Germany.Tel: + 49(0)211 81 18801 ; Fax: + 49(0)211 81 18812 .

Iron is a fundamental trace element for various cellular processes and is important in the respiratory chain of mito-chondria, and essential for cardiomyocyte contractility.
10Ex- perimental animal models reported mitochondrial iron accumulation after cardiac ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) in-jury, associated with signi ﬁcantly impaired cardiac contrac- tility by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiomyocytes. Both blocking ferroptosis and chelatingiron were cardioprotective in a mouse model of myocardial I/R injury.11,12Application of the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) before and during coronary occlusion did not preventthe loss of systolic wall function that occurred during is- chaemia, but signi ﬁcantly enhanced the recovery of seg- mental shortening.13Scavenging of iron through DFO administered at the ﬁrst 15 min of post-ischaemic re ﬂow resulted in greater recovery of myocardial function energy metabolism, and decreased infarct size (IS) in canines14 pointing towards potential deleterious side effects of iron during ischaemia and early reperfusion.
In STEMI patients, intravenous (i.v.) iron-oxide administration 4 days afterAMI improved infarct healing thereby demonstrating bene- ﬁcial effects on global left ventricular (LV) remodelling by decreased end-systolic volume (ESV). 15Adjunctive DFO treatment of STEMI patients prior, during, and after pPCI demonstrated signi ﬁcant reduction of indexes of oxidative stress without limiting IS.16Furthermore, in patients under- going coronary artery bypass grafting, i.v.DFO infusion re- duced ROS production and protected the myocardium against reperfusion injury, especially in patients with re-duced LV ejection fraction.17 These results indicate that the time point of iron treatment during AMI and after reperfusion is critical: while iron appli-cation prior or during ischaemia, and immediately prior to re- perfusion appears detrimental, it seems bene ﬁciary in chronic ischaemic heart disease, 18while its effects early within 1 h or deferred to 24 h after reperfusion are not clear.
Trials in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with LV ejection fraction <40% demonstrated positive effects of iron supplementation.19,20In CHF patients with absolute or func- tional ID with or without anaemia, i.v. administration of iron improved symptoms and exercise capacity.However, thesafety and effectiveness of iron supplementation in STEMI and after pPCI of anaemia is not known.21Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the safety and ef ﬁcacy of iron supplementation within 1 h or deferred to 24 h after re- perfusion in a model of moderate blood loss anaemia with ID and superimposed AMI.Materials and methods Study approval All experiments were performed using protocols approved byLANUV (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt- und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen, AZ: 84-02.04.2018.A234).The investiga- tion conforms to the Guide for the Care and Use of LaboratoryAnimals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No.85-23, revised 1985).
Furthermore, every ex- periment was based on the guidelines of the Federation ofEuropean Laboratory Animal Science Associations. Induction of moderate blood loss anaemia All experiments were performed with C57BL/6J mice obtainedfrom the Janvier Labs (Saint-Berthevin, France).Anaemia was induced in healthy 10- to 12-week-old male mice by repetitive collection of blood from the facial vein as previouslydescribed.22The amount of every blood draw was less than 15% of the total circulating blood volume, which was calculated per kg BW of each mouse.To compensate for theblood loss, mice were injected with an equal volume of saline (0.9%) one-half intraperitoneally and the second half subcutaneously.To analyse the complete blood count, blood(30–40μL) was collected from the facial vein and placed in an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-coated microcentrifuge tubes.
The complete blood count was analysed using Scil Vetabc ™haematology analyser following the manufacturer ’s instructions (scilVet, Germany). Chemicals Ferinject® (50 mg iron/mL) was purchased from Vifor Pharma AG (Deutschland) and diluted 1:10 (v/v) in saline (0.9%).Allmice were injected with 20 mg iron per kg BW Ferinjet® 23 through a tail vein in a volume of 100 μL.For each time point, control and anaemic mice came from the same cohort andwere processed simultaneously to minimize cohort-to-cohort variability, yielding two to three evaluable samples per group per time point.Experimental groups Mice were randomly allocated to four experimental groups(Figure 1, Groups A –D).AMI was performed as described previously.24Pre-AMI transthoracic echocardiography was performed in sham mice (Group A) and anaemic mice (Groups B –D) after induction of anaemia for 3 days.Iron was not administered in Groups A –B.In anaemic Group C mice, iron (i.v.20 mg per kg BW) was administered5446 P.

ESC Heart Failure 2021; 8: 5445 –5455 DOI: 10.1002/ehf2.13639 immediately after 1 h of AMI, whereas in Group D, it was ad- ministered 24 h after AMI.In Groups A –B, post-AMI echocar- diography was performed after 24 h.In Groups C and D, echocardiographic analysis was performed 24 h after iron ap- plication.All mice were sacri ﬁced after post-AMI echocardi- ography, hearts were isolated for triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, and IS was determined.Circulating cell-free-haemoglobin, haptoglobin, erythropoietin, ferritin, transferrin, and soluble transferrin receptor To analyse iron and haemolysis after anaemia induction, a separate group of mice were used for the experiments.After3 days of anaemia induction, mice were sedated with 100 mg/kg of ketamine (Ketanest®) and 10 mg/kg of xylazine (Rompun®), and approximately 1 mL of blood was withdrawnby heart puncture.
Blood from anaemic and non-anaemic control mice was collected in heparinized tubes and centri- fuged at 3000 gfor 5 min at 4°C. Plasma was collected and im- mediately frozen at /C080°C until further analysis.Cell-free plasma Hb, haptoglobin, and transferrin were analysed usingrespective Mouse ELISA Kits according to the manufacturer ’s instructions (Abcam; Cambridge, UK).Erythropoietin (Epo),ferritin, and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) were analysed in plasma using the respective Mouse ELISA Kits from MyBioSource (San Diego, USA).In vivo analysis of global left ventricular function and infarct size Serial echocardiographic measurements of global LV function at baseline (Day 3; pre-AMI), and post-AMI, precisely after24 h of i.v.iron supplementation were conducted in all groups (A, B, C, & D).
LV function in anaemia was assessed by record- ing cardiac images using a Vevo 2100 high-resolution ultra-sound scanner with an 18 –38 MHz linear array microscan transducer (Visual Sonics Inc., Toronto, Canada). LV function was analysed by using B-mode images to determine LV vol-umes, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and heart rate (HR) of maximal and minimal cross-sectional areas.25,26Area at risk and IS were determined by post-mortem left anteriordescending artery re-occlusion, Evans blue infusion and stain- ing with TTC as previously described.24Figure 1 Protocols and left ventricular functional analysis of anaemic mice without and with intravenous iron application after reperfused AMI.Sham group of mice (Group A) were punctured with a lancet on the cheek (facial vein) without collection of circulating blood volume.Anaemia (Group B) wasinduced by blood withdrawal on three consecutive days until a target Hb <90 g/L was reached.
On Day 4, mice were subjected to AMI followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Echocardiographic analysis of left ventricular function was performed after induction of anaemia (Day 3) and 24 h after reperfus ed AMI.After reperfused AMI, anaemic mice were randomly assigned to iron treatment 1 h (Group C) or 24 h (Group D) after reperfusion using cage numbers.TTC Staining was performed 24 h after iron administration of reperfused AMI.AMI, acute myocardial infarction; TTC, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride Safety and ef ﬁcacy of iron supplementation after myocardial infarction 5447 ESC Heart Failure 2021; 8: 5445 –5455 DOI: 10.1002/ehf2.13639 Statistics Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.Multiple comparisons were per- formed by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures (anaemiavs.sham, time course).Differences among groups were tested by two-way ANOVA with a Tukey test as post-hoc test.For comparison of two groups, an unpaired Student ’st-test was used.
Investigations of LV function by echocardiography were analysed by paired Student ’st-test. A Pvalue of <0.05 was considered signi ﬁcant.Data were analysed with Prism (GraphPad Software, Version 6.05).Results Induction of moderate anaemia The mouse model of subacute blood loss anaemia resulted in an Hb level of approximately ≤9.0 g/dL as compared with sham mice ( Table 1).With induction of anaemia red blood cell (RBC) morphology changed, as evidenced by increased anisocytosis, rouleaux formation, and decreased mean cor- puscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin,mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, and increased red blood cell distribution width (RDW).Increased levels of MCV and RDW after iron administration are indices of an aug-mented erythropoiesis, thus representing an accelerated turnover of RBC in anaemia with a raised number of young RBCs, which are characterized by increased RBC sizes and vol-ume ( Table 1).
We analysed the recovery of Hb levels in a sep- arate group of mice, which showed completely re-established morphology and Hb concentrations within 5 days (data notshown). Intravenous iron was administered within 1 h and af- ter 24 h after reperfusion of AMI ( Figure 1).Iron treatment af- fect blood parameters measured 24 h after reperfusion asdemonstrated by increased MCV and RDW ( Table 1).Characterization of iron metabolism and inﬂammatory response in blood loss anaemia To investigate the exact effects of anaemia on iron metabo- lism, we did not select a pharmacological or genetically exhausted mouse model for ID anaemia, but induced blood loss anaemia by repetitive and moderate bleeding of mice.As RBC contains iron, daily blood loss was associated with a loss of cellular iron resulting in ID.

25The LV function and LV transformation continued to be reduced even though Hb concentrations were restored (85.0 ± 2.0 on Day 7 post-AMI vs. 89.0 ± 4.0 g/L on Day 0,P<0.05; n= 5/group).25Iron supplementation 24 h after re- perfused AMI led to a reversal of ESV enlargement post-AMI with anaemia and was associated with a trend of improvedSV and CO ( Figure 3).These bene ﬁcial effects were seen only modestly with iron application within 1 h after reperfused AMI.Infarct size in anaemia after iron supplementation in reperfused acute myocardialinfarction Anaemic mice were subjected to induction of AMI followed by treatment with or without a single dose of iron 1 or 24 h after reperfusion.The mean IS after reperfused AMIevaluated by TTC staining was signi ﬁcantly smaller after 24 h of iron administration, whereas early application within 1 h was associated only with a trend of IS reduction ( Figure 4).
The body weight was comparable in mice of the anaemia and sham groups after surgery [body weights in g; sham (27.25 ± 1.64) vs. anaemia (26.83 ± 0.45); P= 0.893].Anaemia was associated with increased mortality during ischaemia, whereas iron supplementation within 1 or 24 h post-I/R injury demonstrated no further increase in mortality in respectivetreatment groups, suggesting that iron supplementation may be safe in the early phase of post-AMI.Discussion In summary, this experimental model of reperfused AMI withanaemia shows the following:LV compensates the diminished oxygen-carrying capacity in anaemia via increases in HR and EDV consecutively with improved SV and CO.This compensation is lost in AMI.Reversal of ID in anaemia increases SV post-AMI via a dis- tinct mechanism by limiting enlargement of ESV.The time point of iron supplementation after reperfusion is critical.Reversal of ID in anaemia post-AMI is effective 24 h after reperfusion and appears to be safe.
The molecular pathways of this mechanism have to be determined. Theﬁndings appear to be relevant in planning of future clinical trials aiming to validate the bene ﬁt of iron supple- mentation in patients with anaemia and STEMI, as timepoints of application after AMI appear to be critical.Our mouse model of moderate anaemia induced by repeti- tive blood loss tend to mimic the patterns of anaemia in hospi- talized patients with cardiovascular diseases characterized by altered morphology of the erythrocytes, the integrity of themembrane, haemolysis, in ﬂammatory response, and ID.7,27 Cardiac function in anaemia was characterized by increased HR, EDV, and consecutively increased CO to compensate forthe reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.Iron sup- plementation in anaemia 24 h after reperfused AMI had no ef- fects on EDV, but led to a reversal of ESV increase.ReducedESV led consecutively to improved SV and CO.
Early treatment of iron immediately within 1 h demonstrated no additional bene ﬁts. In both protocols, iron administration was safe and did not affect mortality.Thus, the present study supports the notion that iron administration at least in ID-associated anae- mia appears safe and bene ﬁcial when applied 24 h after reper- fusion of AMI.Anaemia and iron de ﬁciency Anaemia and absolute or relative ID are common entities that coexist in patients with CHF, which are associated with poorclinical status and worse outcomes after AMI.28Hb levels of anaemic patients have been shown to correlate with the prognosis and mortality after acute adverse events in hospi-tals, especially in patients with AMI.29 Measurement of ferritin, TSAT, sTfR, and the sTfR –ferritin index are more accurate than classical red cell indices to de-lineate ID in anaemia.
30In our study, anaemic wildtype mice also exhibited features of iron-restricted erythropoiesis such as increased expression of sTfR and Epo, while TSATremained unchanged and plasma transferrin showed a ten- dency to decrease. It has been recognized that patients with HF show an in- creased tendency to develop ID, as a consequence of the de- pletion of iron stores or defective iron absorption.31TheSafety and ef ﬁcacy of iron supplementation after myocardial infarction 5449 ESC Heart Failure 2021; 8: 5445 –5455 DOI: 10.1002/ehf2.13639 Figure 2 Blood loss anaemia is associated with iron de ﬁciency and haemolysis.Data are mean ± SD from n=8( A –F),n= 7 (G) mice/group.Unpaired t- test; n.s.= not signi ﬁcant; * P<0.05 vs.sham 5450 P.Wischmann et al .ESC Heart Failure 2021; 8: 5445 –5455 DOI: 10.1002/ehf2.13639 Figure 3 Analysis of LV function in anaemic mice with and without iron supplementation after reperfused AMI.
LV function of sham and sham anaemic mice were analysed at baseline (Day 3) and 24 h after reperfused AMI. Anaemic mice were treated with i.v.iron 1 and 24 h after reperfused AMI andunderwent echocardiographic analysis.Anaemia was associated with increases in heart rate (HR), end-diastolic volume (EDV), stroke volume (SV), a nd cardiac output (CO).Superimposition of AMI further impaired global left ventricular (LV) function in anaemia.The increase in end-systolic volume (ESV) associated with AMI is in part rescued by application of iron 24 h post-AMI (C).Data are presented as mean ± SD from n=6–8 mice/group.Multiple comparison with two-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test; * P<0.05, ** P<0.01, *** P<0.001 vs.sham; #P<0.05,##P<0.01,###P<0.001 vs.pre- AMI; and$$P<0.01 vs.anaemia.
AMI, acute myocardial infarction Safety and ef ﬁcacy of iron supplementation after myocardial infarction 5451 ESC Heart Failure 2021; 8: 5445 –5455 DOI: 10.1002/ehf2.13639 correction of ID with the use of intravenous iron in patients with CHF has been reported with good safety pro ﬁles overall.19Despite these bene ﬁcial effects of reduced rate of rehospitalization, increased cardiac exercise capacity, and im-provement in the quality of life, insuf ﬁcient data exist whether potential bene ﬁcial or harmful effects of ironapplication given during either ischaemia or immediately af- ter reperfusion in STEMI patients. Iron administration in the setting of AMI remains contro- versial because of its potential toxicity, including oxidativestress induction and preventing cardiomyocyte contractility.In iron therapies intended to improve AMI, the dose and timeFigure 4 Assessment of infarct size in anaemic mice with and without iron supplementation after reperfused acute myocardial infarction.

iron (20 mg iron per kg BW), which is equivalent to that eval- uated in clinical trials in HF patients.19Superimposition of AMI in anaemic mice impaired LV functional compensationand increased mortality during ischaemia the lower the Hb levels were. 7,25These ﬁndings are in line with clinical studies that demonstrated increased mortality associated with lowerHb levels (below 90 to 80 g/L).36Consistent with other studies,16we did not observe differences in LV function and IS between non-anaemic and anaemic mice post-AMI.Thereason for this observation is partly also explained by a dis- tinct mortality rate in anaemic mice after AMI and resulted decrease in sample size.In our previous study, we showedthat AMI resulted in a mortality of 33% in anaemic mice com- pared with 2 –3% in the sham group, ratios that were corrob- orated in the present study.Thus, anaemic mice with largerinfarcts may have died earlier thus affecting the comparison of surviving anaemic and non-anaemic mice.
Overall, increas- ing sample size will be considered for future experiments. Iron administration within 1 h after I/R was neutral with re- spect to changes in LV function and potential side effects.Ad- ministration 24 h after I/R injury showed positive side effectson myocardial function as demonstrated by the enhanced re- covery of LV function through reversal of ESV increase and un- changed EDV.While several experimental studies unravelledharmful side effects of iron given during ischaemia and early reperfusion, our data imply that application of iron at least in anaemia with superimposed AMI is safe when deferred witha time delay of 24 h after reperfusion of AMI and early enough to impact on early LV remodelling post-AMI.
Efﬁcacy of iron application to modulate let ventricular function after acute myocardialinfarction Several studies demonstrated that the time point of iron treatment during AMI appears harmful in the acute phase of AMI, in particular during reperfusion, which is caused bymitochondrial iron accumulation and leads to impaired car- diac contractility due to increased ROS within the cardiomyocytes. 33Besides, these toxic effects of early iron application during or prior to reperfusion were prevented by the administration of iron chelator DFO 15 min prior to and 15 min throughout of coronary occlusion of reperfusion,which showed a cardioprotective effect through improvedmyocardial high-energy phosphate metabolism and LV con- tractility after a period of global ischaemia.13These data sup- port that iron catalysis is involved in the production ofoxygen-derived free radicals during I/R injury.
11,14In contrast, iron application in chronic ischaemic HF appears bene ﬁcial.20 No data on the effectiveness of iron supplementation 1 h or after 24 h after reperfusion of AMI in anaemia exist. In the acute phase of reperfusion after AMI deferring, iron applica- tion to 24 h appears as an attractive time window to modu-late initial LV remodelling.Conclusions In conclusion, in anaemia, iron administration 24 h after re-perfusion of AMI is associated with a reduced ESV and a trend to decreased IS.These ﬁndings highlight the potential of iron treatment in anaemia with ID as an adjunctive treat-ment in the reperfusion after AMI.We have shown that the time point of iron application is critical, which needs to be proven in clinical studies.Acknowledgements We thank Mareike Cramer for assistance in critical discussionand revision of the manuscript.Conﬂict of interest None declared.FF is an employee of Vifor Pharma Manage- ment Ltd.
