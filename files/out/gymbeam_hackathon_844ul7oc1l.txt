Due to the high impermeability of the mito-chondrial inner membrane, these cofactors need to be synthesized within the mitochondria or be imported, themselves or one of their precursors, into the organelles.Transporters belonging to the protein family of mitochondrial car- riers have been identified to transport the coenzymes: thiamine pyrophosphate, coenzyme A, FAD and NAD +, which are all structurally similar to nucleotides and derived from different B-vitamins.
These mitochondrial cofactors bind more or less tightly to their enzymes and, after having been involved in a spe- cific reaction step, are regenerated, spontaneously or by other enzymes, to return to their active form, ready for the next catalysis round. Disease-causing mutations in the mitochondrial cofactor carrier genes compromise not only the transport reaction but also the activity of all mitochondrial enzymes using that particular cofactor and the metabolic pathways in which the cofactor-dependent enzymes are involved.

KEYWORDS coenzyme, coenzyme A, flavin adenine dinucleotide, mitochondria, mitochondrial carrier family SLC25, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, thiamine pyrophosphate 1|INTRODUCTION Many enzymes use different non-proteic cofactors, such as metal ions and organic coenzymes, that have an important role in catalysis, for example, by activating the substrates, transferring chemical groups and donating/accepting electrons or protons. Whereas many microor- ganisms and plants have biosynthesis capabilities for the coenzymes, animals depend on diet absorption of most ofthem or their precursors, in the form of vitamins or essential amino acids.Subsequently, the cofactors or their precursors and derivatives are distributed, taken up byvarious tissue cell types, and the precursors are modified to assume their active forms.Many of these cofactors are required in the mitochondrial matrix for enzymatic activ-ities of vital importance in central metabolism.
Some ofthe mitochondrial cofactors are synthesized or assem- bled, at least partly, in mitochondria, such as ubiquinone, lipoate, iron –sulfur clusters and heme. 1–4Others have to be imported into mitochondria, such as thiamine pyro- phosphate (ThPP), FAD, NAD+, CoA, pyridoxal phos- phate, biotin, tetrahydrofolate and cobalamin, that are allB-type vitamins or their derivatives: B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyri- doxine), B7 (biotin), B9 (folic acid or folate) and B12(cobalamins), respectively.
Until now, mitochondrialcoenzyme transporters have been identified for ThPP, CoA, FAD (and folate) and NAD +, and they all belong to the mitochondrial carrier protein family.5–13 Mitochondrial carriers (MCs or SLC25 in higher ani- mals) are found in all eukaryotes in variable numbers: 35 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ,5 3i n Homo sapiens and 58 in Arabidopsis thaliana .14–17They all have the N- and C-termini exposed towards the cytosolic side of the mito- chondrial membrane and a triple-repeated sequence ofabout 100 amino acids, which contains two transmem- brane segments that are linked by a signature motif sequence PX[DE]XX[KR]X[KR]X 20/C030[DE]GXXXX [WYF][KR]G (PROSITE PS50920, PFAM PF00153 andIPR00193).
18–23With a few exceptions, MCs are localized to the inner membrane of mitochondria, where their about 300-residue structure is arranged in a barrel of six-transmembrane α-helices (H1-H6) around a central sub- strate translocation pore with gates towards theintermembrane space (cytoplasmic c-gate) and matrix (m-gate) sides of the membrane. 24–26With this structural arrangement, MCs transport their specific substratesacross the mitochondrial inner membrane with a similar mechanism (named “single binding center-gating ”, 27“ping pong ”20,28–30and recently “alternating access transport ” mechanism25) by binding the substrates in the central part of the pore and alternatively opening and closing the gates for entry and exit of the transported solute on the oppositeside of the membrane.
23,26,31 –35Besides the above- mentioned cofactors, different MCs have been shown to transport specific substrates, for example, phosphate, sul-fate, 2-oxoglutarate, 2-oxoadipate, malate, citrate, aspar- tate, glutamate, ornithine, arginine and methylarginines, branch chain amino acids (BCAA), purine and pyrimidinenucleotides and deoxynucleotides. 36–43In phylogenetic analysis, MCs are divided into three main clusters that coincide with the type of substrate they transport: nucleo- tides, carboxylated metabolites and amino acids.32,44It has been shown that there is a co-variation between the type of substrate and the MC residues in the central translocation pore approximately halfway between thetwo gates on H4 in the so-called contact point II (motifs G[IVLM] for nucleotides, R[QHNT] for carboxylated metabolites, and R[DE] for amino acids), which are partof the substrate-binding site.
45–48The MCs for B-vitamin derived cofactors all belong to the nucleotide- transporting carriers, both considering the contact II resi- dues and their clustering in phylogenetic analysis, withthe exception of the animal NAD +transporter SLC25A51.32,36,49The fact that they belong to nucleotide- transporting carriers is not surprising given that ThPP,CoA, FAD and NAD +all enclose nucleotide or nucleotide-like moieties (Figure 1). The substrates of many human, S.cerevisiae and A.thaliana MCs have been identified through an approach comprising their recombinant expression, puri- fication and reconstitution into liposomes that are usedin transport assays (EPRA method).50,51,36Besides deter- mining the substrate specificity, the transport assays have been used to identify mitochondrial carrier inhibitors, characterize their kinetic parameters and their modes oftransport, that is, uniport, symport and antiport, of which the latter is most common, 52quantify the importance ofPALMIERI ET AL .
593 each residue along their structure as well as to hypothe- size their physiological roles.16,53–60To understand the physiological role of MCs, their characterized transport function is integrated with the knowledge of the identi-fied substrates in metabolism, position in metabolic path-ways, subcellular location of the substrates and enzymes using them. Many important clues also come from human diseases caused by mutations in MCs.61–64By using this kind of analysis, the importance for mitochon- drial and general metabolism of MC-mediated transportof the B-vitamin derived cofactors thiamine pyrophos- phate, coenzyme A, FAD and NAD+is demonstrated in this review.2|THIAMINE PYROPHOSPHATE Thiamine pyrophosphate (ThPP), also known as thia- mine diphosphate, is an essential cofactor that is required in the general metabolism of all organisms.
It is a deriva- tive of thiamine (vitamin B1 or aneurin) that consists of asix-membered pyrimidine ring linked through a methy-lene to a five-membered thiazole ring, in which the carbon-5 substitution may be covalently linked to one, two or three phosphates, forming thiamine monop-hosphate (ThMP), diphosphate (i.e., ThPP, Figure 1a)o r triphosphate (ThTP), respectively. ThPP is the active cofactor form and corresponds to about 80% of thiaminefound in the human body as free thiamine, ThMP, ThPP, and ThTP.65When ThPP is bound to enzymes its phos- phates are coordinated by Mg2+and function as a handle to keep the cofactor in the right position in the active site.The reactivity of ThPP depends on the activation of carbon-2 (C2) between the nitrogen and the sulfur in thethiazole ring that, upon donation of a hydrogen ion,forms a carbanion.This acts as a nucleophile attacking a carbonyl-carbon of the first substrate.
66In most reactions, the C2-proton is donated to the N04 amino group of the pyrimidine moiety, being in proximity in the v- conformation of ThPP (Figure 1a). The metastable reac- tion intermediate formed by a covalent bond, betweenthe thiazole-C2 of ThPP and the carbonyl-carbon of the first substrate, is then resolved by reacting with the sec- ond substrate and giving rise to the subsequent formationof the products.In this second “half”-reaction ThPP thia- zole C2 gets re-protonated and returns to its initial state (Figure 1a).Although ThPP-dependent enzymes have dif- ferent 2-oxocarboxylate or 2-hydroxycarboxylate sub-strates and catalyse diverse reactions that break or make C C, C N, C O, C H, and C S bonds, from a mecha- nistic point of view their reactions may all be categorizedinto decarboxylations and non-decarboxylations (i.e., transferase or transketolase reactions).
67Active site residues and additional cofactors or prosthetic groups fur-ther contribute to ThPP reactivity, catalysis and substrate binding. 2.1 |Biosynthesis and distribution of ThPP Thiamine, which is necessary for ThPP formation, is syn- thesized de novo in most prokaryotes and some FIGURE 1 Coenzymes represented in ball-and-stick.(a) Thiamine pyrophosphate, (b) coenzyme A, (c) FAD and(d) NAD +.These cofactors have nucleotide and nucleotide-like moieties: coenzyme A, FAD and NAD+contain an adenosine, whereas ThPP lacks the ribose but contains a pyrimidine.All fourof them contain a pyrophosphate594 PALMIERI ET AL .eukaryotes, such as fungi and plants, but not in animals.The biosynthesis of thiamine requires different enzymesin different species; however, the thiazole and pyrimidine moieties are always synthesized by separate pathways before they are conjugated, as described in detail in sev-eral reviews.
68–70In prokaryotes, the thiazole and pyrimi- dine rings are linked by thiamine phosphate synthase to form ThMP. ThMP is subsequently phosphorylated bythiamine phosphate kinase to form ThPP.In bacteria, cytoplasmic ThPP is used directly by, for example, trans- ketolase, and other enzymes, that in eukaryotes arelocated in mitochondria, such as the E1 components ofpyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and acetolactate synthase.In yeast too, the thiazole ring and the pyrimidine ring are unified by thiamine phosphatesynthase to ThMP.68ThMP is then dephosphorylated to thiamine, which is diphosphorylated to produce ThPP.Whereas the yeast enzymes involved in ThMP biosynthesisare all located in the cytoplasm, in plants ThMP produc- tion takes place in chloroplasts and only the last two reac- tions needed to convert ThMP into ThPP take place in thecytoplasm, as in yeast.
70In all thiamine-producing organ- isms additional enzymes taking part in thiamine salvage pathways have been identified, that is, various bacteriahave several enzymes for thiazole, pyrimidine and thia-mine recuperation 69as well as active and facilitated trans- porters for thiamine uptake71,72; yeast may import thiamine from the environment by Thi7p (Thi10p)73and convert it into ThPP68; Arabidopsis too have various thia- mine salvage pathways that bypass the energetic costs of de novo biosynthesis of ThPP.70In thiamine-synthesizing organisms, the expression levels of several enzymes involved in ThPP biosynthesis are regulated by feed-back inhibition mechanisms involving mRNA riboswitches,which sense increased concentrations of ThPP leading toreduced transcription and translation.
74 Animals, which are all unable of ThPP biosynthesis, rely on the absorption of the essential vitamin thiamineand its derivatives from the diet (RDA about 1.2 mg for adults), mainly depending on plant-produced thiamine and animal/gut microflora-synthesized ThPP. 75In humans, it has been estimated that about 95% of the thia- mine intake (normally <2 mg) is absorbed by the body.Most of thiamine absorption is thought to take place inthe proximal part of the small intestine by the major high-affinity thiamine transporters SLC19A2 (ThTR- 1) 76,77and SLC19A3 (ThTR-2),78,79which have about 48% sequence identity and belong to the 12 transmembraneα-helix major facilitator family of membrane trans- porters.Furthermore, a homolog of these two proteins, SLC19A1, which is mainly a folate transporter, may con-tribute to the transport of ThMP in the gastrointestinaltract to some extent.
80In colon, thiamine may also be taken up by the unspecific organic cation transporters(OCTs), and ThPP specifically by SLC44A44. 81,82The thi- amine and thiamine derivatives absorbed across the api- cal membrane of intestinal epithelial cells are exportedthrough the basolateral membrane into the blood, proba- bly via some of the above-mentioned transporters.Subse- quently, thiamine is distributed throughout the body byerythrocytes, which assimilate >80% of the total blood thiamine (total body content of thiamine and its deriva- tives about 25 –30 mg) and is found especially in skeletal muscles, heart, brain, liver and kidneys.
83To import thia- mine or its derivatives, cells are thought to use several different transporters, many of which are expressed in numerous cell types at different levels; these transportersare SLC19A2 (highly expressed in skeletal muscle), 76,77 SLC19A3 (adipose tissue, breast and placenta), SLC19A1(blood and brain), SLC35F3 (brain) 84and SLC22A1 (OCT1, liver)85(Figure 2). Excess thiamine from intesti- nal absorption and cell secretion (9 –18 days turnover time) is eliminated from circulation mainly through urine byglomerular filtration and in minor quantities in faeces and sweat in the form of free thiamine, ThMP, ThPP or more than 20 different degradation intermediates.
75,86,87 Once imported into the cytoplasm of animal cells, thi- amine is transformed into ThPP by thiamine pyro- phosphokinase (TPK1, thiamine pyrophosphotransferase or thiamine diphosphokinase) by transfer of a pyrophos-phate from ATP onto thiamine (Figure 2).88Most proba- bly cell-imported ThMP is converted into free thiamine and then to ThPP as in yeast and plants. ThPP is rapidlybound to proteins or imported into organelles leaving only a small cytoplasmic fraction free, which has a fast turnover although not being very reactive by itself.89In most eukaryotic cells, cytosolic ThPP is a cofactor oftransketolase (TKT), which is an enzyme of the pentose phosphate shunt.90Cytosolic ThPP may also be used by adenylate kinase 1 (AK-1) to form ThTP, which corre-sponds to approximately 5 –10% of total thiamine in the human body and has a regulatory role activating the chloride channels and acting as a phosphate donor insome phosphorylation reactions.
89,91,92Moreover, in plant and yeast, cytosolic ThPP is used as a cofactor by pyruvate decarboxylases (PDC) for the non-oxidative con-version of pyruvate (and other 2-oxo acids) to acetalde- hydes (and other aldehydes) and CO 2.93,94The existence of other ThPP-dependent enzymes and riboswitches inmany non-mammalian organisms have made them inter-esting targets for drugs/pesticides. 95 In eukaryotic cells, as mentioned above, cytoplasmic ThPP is distributed into the subcellular compartments; inmost human cells, about 50% of total thiamine is foundPALMIERI ET AL .595 in cytoplasm, 35% in mitochondria, 10% in nucleus and 5% in ER75although in rat brain a much higher thiamine level has been measured in mitochondria versus cyto-plasm.96In fact, ThPP is known to be a cofactor not only of enzymatic reactions in cytoplasm but also in ER, per- oxisomes and mitochondria (Figure 2) as well as in chlo- roplasts.
In ER, ThPP is required for 2-hydroxyacyl-CoAlyase 2 (HACL2 or ILVBL) in the phytosphingosine (and other 2-hydroxy-fatty acids) α-oxidation degradation pathway. 97In animal and probably also in plant peroxi- somes, ThPP is a coenzyme of 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 1 (HACL1), which catalyses the cleavage of phytanic acid(and other 3-methyl branched fatty acids) in α-oxida- tion.98Mitochondria require import of ThPP for the fol- lowing enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), whichconverts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA which enters the tricar- boxylic acid (TCA) cycle 99; 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), an enzyme of the TCA cycle100; 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase (OADH)101; branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH in animals and plants), which is involved in the degradation of BCAA102(Figure 2); and acetolactate synthase (ALS in yeast), which is involved inBCAA biosynthesis.
In plants, ThPP serves as a cofactor for chloroplastic pyruvate dehydrogenase to produce FIGURE 2 Thiamine metabolism and transport in a typical human cell.

70Whereas no transporters for ThPP or other forms of thiamine have been identified for their import into ER, peroxisomes or chloroplasts, mito-chondrial ThPP transporters have been identified in yeast, insect, human and plants. 2.2 |Mitochondrial transporters of ThPP InS.cerevisiae , a mitochondrial transporter for ThPP has been identified and named the ThPP carrier (Tpc1p), which is encoded by YGR096w and belongs to the MC family.7Tpc1p is responsible for the import of cytosol- synthesized ThPP into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is required as a cofactor for a few enzymes.Several pieces of evidence from in vivo and in vitro experiments led to the annotation of this function to this carrier.7The localization of Tpc1p to the mitochondrial inner membrane was demonstrated by immunoblot ofmitochondria and co-fractionation with an inner mem-brane protein marker.
7The function of Tpc1p was espe- cially associated with anaerobic metabolism in yeast, because of its higher expression levels on fermentablethan on non-fermentable carbon sources. In fact, only on synthetic minimal media (SM) supplemented with fer- mentable carbon sources, the yeast TPC1 knockout strain (tpc1Δ) displayed a requirement for thiamine or BCAA for growth.This finding was interpreted as an indication that Tpc1p was involved in mitochondrial ThPP importto supply the cofactor for ALS.Therefore, ALS andOGDH activities were measured in mitochondrial extracts from the tpc1Δstrain grown under the above- mentioned conditions (SM with a fermentable carbonsource without thiamine) and found to be 20% and 25%, respectively, of those of the wild-type extracts.Interest- ingly, both the activities could be restored by addingThPP to the reaction.In contrast, the activity of PDC, which is localized in the cytoplasm, was equal in tpc1Δ and wild-type cells.
The levels of ThPP were eight timeshigher in mitochondria of wild-type cells compared with tpc1Δcells, whereas the cytosolic levels were similar in both of them. It is noteworthy that no growth defect ofthetpc1Δstrain was observed with non-fermentable car- bon sources, although substantial mitochondrial require- ment for ThPP would also be expected.This finding could indicate that in aerobic conditions another mito-chondrial ThPP transporter exists or that an uncharacterized mitochondrial ThPP salvage pathway isactivated.In conclusion, these in vivo experiments sug- gest that Tpc1p is involved in ThPP import into yeastmitochondria.
The EPRA method was applied to confirm the identi- fication of Tpc1p and characterize its transport propertiesby several sets of experiments 7: (a) substrate homo- exchange (with the proteoliposomes loaded with a sub- strate and the same radioactively-labelled substrate addedexternally) to identify transportable radioactive sub- strates; (b) hetero-exchange (with different substrates loaded in the proteoliposomes and an identified trans-portable radioactive substrate added externally) to iden-tify exchangeable substrates (without the need of having all substrates radioactively labelled); (c) and efflux (with the identified transportable radioactive substrate loadedinto the proteoliposomes and various externally added unlabeled substrates).
Furthermore, the conditions of these experiments were also varied, for example, times ofreaction (for time-courses of transport), concentrations of substrate (for kinetic parameter determinations), pH values, omission of the non-radioactive substrate(to study uniport), addition of competitive substrates or various inhibitors (specific inhibitors or general protein modifiers). At the time of Tpc1p characterization by theEPRA method, no radioactive ThPP was available.How-ever, radioactive dATP was shown to be transported by Tpc1p in the experimental set (a) and exchanged for ThPP in the (b) and (c) procedures.7Furthermore, non- radioactive ThPP efflux from proteoliposomes was assayed enzymatically.Taken together, the in vitro results obtained by the EPRA method demonstrated thatTpc1p is able to transport ThPP, ThMP, and to a lower extent PAP, various ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucle- otides, but not many compounds such as thiamine, aden-osine, CoA or S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).
The Tpc1p-catalysed ThPP transport was observed to be faster in antiport than in uniport mode. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax for dATP uniport uptake were determinedto be 0.5 mM and about 40 μmol/g protein per minute at 25 /C14C, respectively.Competitive dATP transport inhibi- tion by addition of ThPP, ThMP, dADP, ADP and AMPwas also studied to determine their constants (Ki), which are about 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.6 mM, respectively.Based on these results, it was suggested that the mainfunction of Tpc1p is to import ThPP into the mitochon- drial matrix by uniport transport or in exchange for ThMP or one of the other substrates.7 InH.sapiens the closest homolog of yeast Tpc1p is called SLC25A19 (TPC).To this carrier was originally, even before the characterization of Tpc1p, attributed deoxynucleotide transport ability (and therefore nameddeoxynucleotide carrier, DNC).103Deoxynucleotides were investigated by the EPRA method because phylogeneticPALMIERI ET AL .
597 analyses showed that TPC clusters together with the ade- nine nucleotide carrier. The conclusion of the initialexperiments was that TPC transports deoxynucleoside diphosphates and ADP very efficiently, GDP, CDP, UDP and dideoxynucleoside triphosphates less effectively, andNTPs, dNTPs, dNMPs and phosphate at low levels, whereas no transport was observed with NMPs.103Due to the findings with S.cerevisiae Tpc1p, which has 28% sequence identity with human TPC, the transport capa- bility of TPC was investigated further.8SLC25A19 knock- out mice displayed elevated 2-oxoglutarate in theamniotic fluid and did only survive the early embryonicstage, but their isolated mitochondria exhibited normal NTP and dNTP levels.On the contrary, mitochondrial ThPP and ThMP levels were reduced, whereas their cyto-solic levels were increased in knockout compared to wild-type cells.In the knockout cells, PDH and OGDH activities were diminished and could be rescued by addi-tion of ThPP.
Furthermore, EPRA approach results with human TPC showed that SLC25A19 (TPC) is a strict anti- porter with transport capacity for dATP (radioactive formavailable), ThPP and ThMP. Thus, it was clear that TPC can import ThPP into mitochondria; however, given its strict antiport mode of transport, what mitochondrialmatrix substrate is ThPP exchanged with, among all thesubstrates transported by TPC?It should be noted that it had been observed previously that isolated rat-liver mito- chondria may convert ThPP to ThMP 104; however, a mitochondrial phosphatase responsible for this reaction has not been identified yet.In addition, in certain physio- logical conditions mitochondria require a net import ofThPP necessitating another matrix counter-substrate than ThMP.
Therefore, also human TPC has a similar function as yeast Tpc1p: mitochondrial import of ThPP inexchange for ThMP or another of its substrate(Figure 2).8 A mitochondrial ThPP carrier in Drosophila melano- gaster ,DmTpc1p, has also been characterized by the EPRA method.105DmTpc1p, which has 53 and 24% sequence identity with human TPC and yeast Tpc1p, respectively, transports ThPP and, to a lesser extent, (d)NTPs, (d)NDPs and pyrophosphate, whereas ThMP, thia- mine, (d)NMPs or phosphate are not transported. Fur- thermore, DmTpc1p expression complements the growth defects of the S.cerevisiae tpc1 Δstrain grown on ferment- able carbon sources.These results suggest that also DmTpc1p has the function of importing ThPP into mito- chondria in exchange for another of its substrates.InA.thaliana , two isoforms of mitochondrial ThPP car- rier were found, AtTpc1 (At3g21390) and AtTpc2 (At5g48970) that share 74% sequence identity.
They werecharacterized together with their maize homologs, ZmTpc1 (GRMZM2G118515) and ZmTpc2 (GRMZM2G124911) 106;and all of these four plant Tpcs display 23 –24%, 34 –36% and 29 –32% sequence identity with the mitochondrial ThPP carrier from S. cerevisiae ,H.sapiens and D.melanogaster , respectively.Consistently, in phyloge- netic analysis, the four plant proteins cluster togetherwith the human, Drosophila and yeast ThPP carriers.32 Their subcellular localization was determined by twoapproaches; the dual import assay, 107in which radioactively-labelled protein is incubated with isolated plant chloroplast or mitochondria and then treated with proteases, and confocal microscopy of suspension-cultured tobacco BY-2 cells in which GFP-fused carrierconstructs were expressed.108Both approaches indicated that all four proteins are mitochondrial and not localized to chloroplasts, peroxisomes or any other organelle.106 Unfortunately, although AtTpc1, AtTpc2 and ZmTpc1 were expressed in E.
coli with the purpose of being used for characterization by the EPRA method, no activity wasdetected under any of the reconstitution and transport conditions tested. However, the expression of each of the four proteins in the yeast tpc1Δstrain rescued the growth rate on fermentable carbon sources to wild-type levels.Furthermore, ThPP transport in mitochondria isolated from the yeast tpc1Δstrain was restored by the expression of each of the four plant proteins.In addition, ALS activ-ity was rescued in the AtTpc- and ZmTpc-complemented tpc1Δstrain.Taken together, although the biochemical characterization of the isolated proteins remains to bedetermined, the above-mentioned results strongly sup- port the notion that AtTpc1, AtTpc2, ZmTpc1 and ZmTpc2 have a similar physiological function to those ofthe mitochondrial ThPP carriers identified in other organisms.
2.3 |Role of ThPP in mitochondria As illustrated in Figure 2, in animal cells, ThPP is involved in important enzyme reactions in carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid catabolism. ThPP imported into mitochondria is used by four different 2-oxoacid dehydro-genase complexes (PDHc, OGDHc, OADHc and BCKDHc) that, although function in distinct metabolic pathways, have similar macromolecular assembly struc-tures and catalyse quite similar decarboxylation reac- tions.109The E1 components (also called PDH, OGDH, OADH and BCKDH) of the four complexes bind ThPPand the initial 2-oxoacid substrates, whereas the othercomponents E2 and E3 bind the other cofactors: lipoate, CoA, FAD and NAD +.In all four enzymes, ThPP is directly involved in the decarboxylation of the incomingsubstrate and the transfer of the remaining decarboxylated acyl intermediate to lipoate bound to E2.598 PALMIERI ET AL .
The subsequent reaction steps lead to the final formation of acyl-CoA while the electrons are transferred ontoNAD +. The role of ThPP in PDH will be described in the next paragraph and, subsequently, compared with that in the other enzyme complexes.In yeast, mitochondria con-tain another ThPP-dependent enzyme, ALS.PDHc exists in all known organisms and links glycol- ysis to the TCA cycle by catalysing the conversion ofpyruvate into acetyl-CoA and CO 2(Figure 2).110In humans, this large complex consists of multiple copies of the E1, E2 (dihydrolipoyl transacetylase) and E3(dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase) components, with a totalof 114 polypeptides and a mass of 9 MDa.Each human E1 component is a heterotetramer of two α- and two β-subunits (PDHA1/2 and PDHB).
ThPP is bound in the active site of PDH (E1 component) with the pyrimidine ring hydrogen-bonded at the interface between the α- andβ-subunits and the pyrophosphate moiety penetrat- ing into the α-subunit where a Mg 2+is bound leaving the reactive thiazole at the centre of the active pocket where the substrate pyruvate enters.111In all known ThPP- requiring enzymes, a special motif takes part in binding the cofactor: in166GDGX 26NN196of the α-subunit of human PDH Asp167 and Asn196 coordinate the Mg2+, and Gly168 and Ala169 make hydrogen bonds with thepyrophosphate moiety.
111,112The dissociation constant of ThPP in pig heart PDH has been estimated to be about 7μM, which supposedly is above the mitochondrial con- centration of ThPP.113ThPP is directly involved in two consecutive steps of the PDH-catalysed reaction: (a) the deprotonated thiazole-C2 attacks the 2-oxo-carbon ofpyruvate leading to the decarboxylation of pyruvate and the formation of a covalently linked intermediate, (b) the transfer of this intermediate in the reductive acetylationonto the lipoyl group bound to E2 and the return of ThPPto its normal protonated state. 110Subsequently, E2 catal- yses the transfer of the acetyl-moiety to CoA to form acetyl-CoA, and E3 oxidizes the E2 lipoyl group by elec-tron transfer to FAD and then to NAD +.
The binding of ThPP in PDH orders α-subunit loops localized at the entrance of the substrate-binding pocket containing ser-ines, which are phosphorylated/dephosphorylated by kinases/phosphatases and play an important role in the metabolic regulation of PDH activity. 110 OGDH is the E1 component of OGCHc, which catal- yses the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate into succinyl-CoA, a reaction that is most commonly known for its role inthe TCA cycle, where it is a rate-limiting step(Figure 2).114Besides from carbohydrate metabolism, 2-oxoglutarate may also derive from amino acid catabo- lism.ThPP is bound to OGDH in a very similar way asto PDH and the reaction mechanism is also very similar: deprotonated C2 of the ThPP thiazole ring attacks the2-oxo-carbon of 2-oxoglutarate, CO 2leaves and the metastable intermediate is resolved by the transfer ofsuccinyl via lipoate onto CoA by E2 (dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase), while t he electrons are handled by E3 (dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase).
In animals and maybe in plants but not in yeast, OADHc is involved in the catabolism of lysine and tryp- tophan (Figure 2),114f r o mw h i c h2 - o x o a d i p a t ei sd e r i v e d directly in mitochondria or imported into mitochondria via ODC (SLC25A21).115OADHc has its own specific E1 component (encoded by DHTKD1 -dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase domain-containing protein 1),whereas the E2 and E3 components are identical to those of OGDHc. 109The substrate 2-oxoadipate and product glutaryl-CoA are only one CH 2longer than those of OGDHc, 2-oxoglutarate and succinyl-CoA, which is reflected by the slightly larger substrate- binding pocket in OADHc.The reaction mechanism ofOADHc is thought to be very similar to that of OGDHc and PDHc.
BCKDHc, which is found in human and plants but probably not in yeast, is involved in the catabolism of BCAA (leucine, isoleucine and valine), which are impo- rted into mitochondria by SLC25A44 43and deaminated into their corresponding 2-oxoacids (2-oxoisocaproate,2-oxo-3-methylvalerate and 2-oxovalerate) (Figure 2). These 2-oxoacids react with ThPP bound to component E1 (2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase) of BCKDHc, andthe reactions catalysed by E2 (dihydrolipoyl transacylase) and E3 (dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase) lead to the forma- tion of isovaleryl-CoA, 2-methyl-buteryl-CoA andisobutyryl-CoA, which are further transformed to meta- bolic intermediates and acetyl-CoA that may enter the TCA cycle.116 ALS (encoded by ILV2 and ILV6 inS.
cerevisiae )i sa ThPP-requiring enzyme, which catalyses the first step out of four in the biosynthetic pathway of BCAA in yeast.117 Whereas yeast ALS is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the corresponding enzyme AHAS of plants is local- ized to chloroplasts and that of bacteria in the cytoplasm, no counterpart of these enzymes exists in animals. ALScondenses two molecules of pyruvate producing CO 2and 2-acetolactate (which is used for the synthesis of valine and leucine) or one molecule of pyruvate and one of2-oxobutyrate forming 2-aceto-2-hydroxybutyrate for iso- leucine synthesis.Thus, unlike all the other mitochon- drial above-mentioned 2-oxoacid dehydrogenasecomplexes that have similar supramolecular structures,ALS is different and belongs, together with PDC, to the pyruvate oxidase protein family.In fact, ALS consists of a catalytic subunit (CSU, ILV2), containing the cofactorsThPP, Mg 2+and FAD, and a regulatory subunit (RSU, ILV6).118PALMIERI ET AL .
599 2.4 |Diseases related to thiamine and ThPP Several diseases, both acquired and genetic, caused by alterations in genes encoding thiamine transporters,thiamine-converting and ThPP-dependent enzymes, have been described. Insufficient intake of thiamine causes beriberi and Wernicke's encephalopathy.119Disease- causing mutations have been found in SLC19A2, SLC19A3, SLC44A44 and TPK1 as well as in the E1 sub- units of the mitochondrial ThPP-dependent enzymesPDHc, OGDHc, OADHc and BCKDHc.120SLC25A19 (TPC) deficiency is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial ThPP importer.Until now, two autosomal recessive disorders have been disclosed:Amish microcephaly (OMIM 607196) and thiamine metabolism dysfunction syndrome 4 (progressive poly- neuropathy type, OMIM 613710).Amish microcephaly isthe more severe form and is caused by the mutation p.Gly177Ala, which affects a highly conserved residue of the second signature motif sequence.
The recombinantprotein harbouring this mutation was found to display a negligible transport activity in proteoliposomes by the EPRA method. 8,121This mutation has been traced back several generations in Amish family in Pennsylvania.121 Amish microcephaly symptoms are severe congenital microcephaly, 2-oxoglutaric aciduria and premature death in many patients.In an attempt to create an animalmodel for SLC25A19 deficiency, mice with the single knockout of this gene appeared normal, whereas the dou- ble knockout displayed mitochondrial ThPP and ThMPdepletion, embryonic lethality, brain malformations and anaemia.8The diminished mitochondrial ThPP content caused reduced OGDHc and PDHc activities resulting in2-oxoglutaric aciduria and accumulation of lactate.Thia-mine metabolism dysfunction syndrome 4 is caused by mutations of non-conserved residues (p.Gly125Ser and p.
Gln192His, inside the substrate translocation pore, and p.Ser194Pro and p.Leu290Gln outside the pore) as well as by the mutation p.Glu304Lys, which affects a conserved residue of the cytoplasmic gate (for a review see Refer-ence 64). This disease is characterized by increased lac- tate levels in cerebrospinal fluid or serum, chronic progressive polyneuropathy and fever-triggered acute epi-sodes of flaccid paralysis and encephalopathy with bilat- eral striatal necrosis.122–125In contrast to Amish microcephaly, patients with this disorder have normalhead circumference, development and cognitive skills,and oral thiamine administration seems to improve the clinical situation.
123,125The severe neuronal syndromes including encephalopathy associated with thiaminemetabolism dysfunction syndrome 4 are also symptoms linked to mutations in SLC19A3, TPK1 and PDHc.Notably, all these genetic variants affect four enzymatic steps on the linear pathway from thiamine absorption toThPP-dependent PDHc activity (Figure 2).120 3|COENZYME A Coenzyme A (CoA, SHCoA, CoASH) is a cofactor present in all organisms of the three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. It is involved in approximately 4% of all enzymatic reactions, most of which play key rolesin the metabolism of fatty acids, carbohydrates, aminoacids and ketone bodies.126CoA is composed of 30-phos- phoadenosine-50diphosphate linked to pantothenate (vitamin B5), which consists of pantoate amide bonded toβ-alanine, which in turn is connected to cysteamine by a second amide bond (Figure 1b).
The terminal thiol group of cysteamine has the property of forming high-energythioester bonds with carboxylated intermediates leading, for example, to the formation of acetyl-CoA and various size acyl-CoA, which can be transferred to various C, O,N and S acceptors in enzymatic reactions, where the CoA moiety is used as a handle. Due to its size and hydro- philic nature, CoA does not penetrate membranes.3.1 |Biosynthesis and distribution of CoA Pantothenate (vitamin B5), which is essential for the formation of the CoA molecule, is synthesized de novoin plants, some bacteria and fungi.In these organisms, pantoate- β-alanine ligase (PanC) catalyses the conden- sation of β-alanine with pantoate to form pantothe- nate.127In non-pantothenate-producing bacteria and fungi, pantothenate is imported by transporters of the major facilitator family with 12 transmembrane helices, such as PanF and Fen2p.
In animals, which are unableto synthesize pantothenate, the uptake of this vitamin is essential. It is found in food such as meat, vegetables, cereal grains, legumes, eggs, and milk as well as is pro-duced by the intestinal flora.Intestinal CoA is hydrolysed into the intermediates dephospho-CoA, 4 0- phosphopantetheine and pantetheine.128In the small intestine, pantothenate is taken up by the sodium- dependent multivitamin transporter SLC5A6 predicted to contain 13 transmembrane segments.129This trans- porter is also expressed in the cellular plasma mem-b r a n eo fh e a r t ,b r a i n ,p l a c e n t a ,l u n g ,l i v e r ,s k e l e t a l muscle, kidney and pancreas, and is therefore probably r e s p o n s i b l ef o rt h ei m p o r to fp a n t o t h e n a t ei nm o s tc e l l s(Figure 3).129In all living organisms pantothenate, cys- teine and four molecules of ATP are used to synthesize600 PALMIERI ET AL .
CoA in a five-step process (Figure 3): (a) pantothenate is phosphorylated to 40-phosphopantothenate by pantothe- nate kinase (PANK1), which is the committed step inCoA biosynthesis, requires ATP and is regulated by product inhibition; (b) cysteine is added to 4 0- phosphopantothenate by phosphopantothenoylcysteinesynthetase (PPCS) to form 4 0-phospho- N- pantothenoylcysteine in an ATP-dependent reaction;(c) the latter metabolite is decarboxylated by pho- sphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPC-DC) to4 0-phosphopantetheine; (d) to which AMP is added by phosphopantetheine adenylyl transferase (PPAT or COASY) to form dephospho-CoA; (e) which is phos- phorylated by dephosphocoenzyme A kinase (DPCK orCOASY) to form CoA. 130In humans, a single polypep- tide chain constitutes CoA synthase COASY, a FIGURE 3 CoA metabolism and transport in a typical human cell.

601 bifunctional enzyme catalysing both PPAT and DPCK ( s t e p[ d ]a n d[ e ] )a c t i v i t i e s .I nh u m a n s ,a l lo ft h e s eenzymes are localized outside mitochondria with the exception of PANK2, one of several PANK isoforms, which has been suggested to be present in the inter-membrane space of mitochondria. 131Furthermore, the subcellular localization of COASY is under debate, because it has been found in association with mitochon-drial outer membrane, 132,133in mitochondrial matrix134–136 and partly in the cytosol.134,137Later, it was found that COASY is expressed as two splice variants: α, which is expressed ubiquitously, and β, which is predominantly expressed in brain.136Unfortunately, in these later stud- ies, the cellular localization of these two variants was not investigated.
However, looking at the pre-sequences, itshould be noted that α-COASY has a predicted N- terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide, whereas β-COASY has a 29 residue N-terminal extension preced- ing the above-mentioned peptide rendering the latter var- iant of COASY to be predicted non-mitochondrial. It has been suggested that CoA may also be synthesizedthrough alternate routes when its intracellular levels are reduced and the de novo pathway is impaired.138Fur- thermore, Daugherty et al.139identified a human gene on chromosome 17, named DCAKD , encoding a putative monofunctional human DPCK enzyme (Accession Num- bers: gi13623688 and Q8WVC6 [UniProt]), which shared 35% sequence identity with the E.coli DPCK over its entire length.Orthologs of monofunctional DCAKD are also present in D.melanogaster (Q9VI57) and C.elegans (P34558).140Interestingly, monofunctional DCAKDs display a greater sequence identity to the E.
coli and other bacterial DPCK sequences than to the paralogous DPCK portions of the bifunctional PPAT/DPCKsequences in each organism. Submitochondrial fraction-ation studies revealed that most of the DCAKD enzy- matic activity is associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria.134 Excess CoA may be degraded intracellularly, mainly by mitochondrial and peroxisomal NUDIX (nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X) hydrolases, or extracellu-larly, which leads to its conversion into pantothenate that may be recycled by cellular uptake and de novo CoA synthesis.141 CoA is distributed within the mammalian cells between the different compartments: cytosol, nucleus, ER, peroxisomes, lysosomes and mitochondria (Figure 3).Cytosolic/nucleic concentrations of CoA are estimatedbetween 0.11 and 0.14 mM in liver and heart, in peroxi- somes 0.3 –0.7 mM CoA, whereas estimated mitochon- drial CoA concentrations are significantly higher, about5 mM.
141Although these estimates are dependent on the purity and integrity of the subcellular fractionations, theysuggest that mitochondria contain 80 –95% of total cellu- lar CoA. In the cytosol and nucleus, CoA is used by ATP-citrate lyase to form acetyl-CoA for fatty acid and steroid synthesis, and for post-translational acetylation of thou- sands of sites on proteins, for example, histones.
142The ratio of acetyl-CoA to CoA controls protein acetylation influencing key cellular processes, such as cell growth, regulated cell death and autophagy.143In the ER mem- brane, SLC33A1 imports acetyl-CoA in exchange for CoA for acetylation of proteins and glycans.144In peroxisomes, ABC transporters ABCD1-3 import a variety of acyl-CoAs, 145and SLC25A17 (as well as its homologue PXN in plants) transport CoA, which is used, for example, in β-oxidation.146,147In mitochondria, CoA is imported into the matrix by SLC25A42,10where it plays key roles in metabolic processes, such as the oxidation of pyruvate, oxoglutarate, BCAA and fatty acids (Figure 3). 3.2 |Mitochondrial transport of CoA The human mitochondrial carrier for CoA is SLC25A42, which clusters together with SLC25A16 as well as yeast Leu5p and YPR011cp, and Arabidopsis AT1G14560 andAT4G26180.32The EPRA approach was employed to characterize SLC25A42.
Among the radioactive sub- strates tested, ATP, ADP and AMP were transported in homo-exchange (type i) experiments; subsequently,radioactive ADP was used in hetero-exchange (type ii) and efflux (type iii) transport experiments. The results showed that SLC25A42 transports CoA, adenosine 3 0,50- diphosphate (PAP), dephospho-CoA and (deoxy-)adenine nucleotides by an obligatory counter-exchange mecha- nism.10Furthermore, radioactive ADP uptake by rec- onstituted SLC25A42 was inhibited competitively by PAP(Ki of 27 μM), ADP (Ki of 54 μM), CoA and dephospho- CoA (Ki about 110 μM for both), the last Ki corresponding approximately to the cytosolic concentra-tion of CoA.
In addition, the expression of human SLC25A42 in a yeast strain with deleted Leu5, which had been suggested previously to be a mitochondrial CoAcarrier, 148complemented the growth defects on non- fermentable carbon sources that require mitochondrial CoA for their oxidation.10Finally, a fusion construct of SLC25A42-GFP expressed in CHO cells showed that the protein is localized to mitochondria.10SLC25A42 is expressed in almost all tissues.149Based on these results and assuming a cytosolic localization of the COASY, itwas suggested that the main function of SLC25A42 is to import cytosolic CoA or dephospho-CoA into the mito- chondrial matrix in exchange for PAP, which is generatedfrom CoA in the mitochondrial matrix, or another sub- strate. 10An alternative scenario should be taken into602 PALMIERI ET AL .consideration if COASY were localized in the matrix.
In this case, SLC25A42 could be involved in the export ofCoA, dephospho-CoA or PAP from the mitochondria, possibly by an exchange reaction with ADP. 10Outside the mitochondria, dephospho-CoA would be converted toCoA by the monofunctional DCAKD localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane.134This hypothetical route might also be operating in D.melanogaster , where the SLC25A42 ortholog transports dephospho-CoA (and not CoA, see below) and DCAKD is present too.Although SLC25A42 can bi-directionally exchange CoAor dephospho-CoA with [ 14C]ADP in vitro,10no data are available about the direction of this exchange reaction in vivo until now.Answering this question may be of utmost importance in the light of the conflicting resultson the sub-mitochondrial localization of COASY.The functions of some of the SLC25A42 homologues have also been investigated.
It is likely that yeast Leu5p isa mitochondrial transporter for CoA or one of its precur- sors, because deletion of its gene reduces mitochondrial CoA content and diminishes the activity of mitochondrialCoA-dependent enzymes. 148The same conclusion was drawn for the human SLC25A16, which partly comple- ments the alterations observed in the Leu5-knockoutstrain.148However, the substrate specificities of these two proteins have not yet been investigated.By using the EPRA method, yeast YPR011cp has been shown to trans- port not CoA or PAP but phosphate, sulfate, adenosine 50- phosphosulfate (APS) and 30-phospho-adenosine 50- phosphosulfate (PAPS), the last two being structurally sim- ilar to PAP.150The homologue of SLC25A42 in D.melanogaster has been characterized using the EPRA method and shown to transport dephospho-CoA (and (deoxy-)adenine nucleotides) but not CoA; it also comple-ments the growth defects of the yeast Leu5-deletionstrain.
151Arabidopsis AT1G14560 and AT4G26180 (and their two maize homologues), which are localized to mito- chondria as shown by the dual import assay and confocalmicroscopy of tobacco BY-2 cells with GFP-fused proteins, also rescue the growth defects and the reduced mitochon- drial CoA content of the yeast Leu5-deletion strain. 152 Taken together, these findings suggest that the SLC25A42 homologues, with the exception of YPR011cp, have a simi- lar physiological function in importing CoA and/ordephospho-CoA into mitochondria.3.3 |Role of CoA in mitochondria Mitochondrial CoA is used by a long list of matrix enzymes involved in carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid andketone body catabolism to form various length acyl- chain-CoA intermediates, most of which eventually endup as acetyl-CoA (Figure 3).
Glycolysis-derived and mitochondrially-imported pyruvate is transformed intoacetyl-CoA by PDHc (as described in Section 2.3); the E2 component transfers the acetyl-moiety (originally donated from pyruvate in E1) from the lipoyl group ontoCoA, followed by re-oxidation of lipoate by the E3 com- ponent. 110In the TCA cycle, CoA is used by the E2 com- ponent of OGDHc to form succinyl-CoA.In themitochondrial β-oxidation, CoA substitutes the carnitine moiety of mitochondrially-imported carnitine-linked fatty acid chains by the action of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2, and functions as a handle in thesubsequent steps catalysed by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase andβ-ketothiolase, of which the latter adds a new CoA molecule to the remaining acyl chain after the exit of the terminal acetyl-CoA.
In amino acid catabolism, the E2 component (lipoamide acyltransferase) of BCKDHc addsCoA to the 2-oxoacids derived from BCAAs; branched- chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenases convert the car- bon skeletons into acetyl-CoA; and the E2 component ofOADHc adds CoA onto 2-oxoadipate, which is derived from lysine and tryptophan, and is further converted to acetyl-CoA. Finally, ketone bodies, such as acetoacetateandβ-hydroxybutyrate, are utilized for ATP production by conversion into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrial matrix of non-hepatic tissues when glucose and glycogen stores are diminished.153 Once mitochondrial acetyl-CoA has been formed it may be used in various ways.When the cellular demand for ATP is high, most acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle bycitrate synthase, which condenses acetyl and oxaloacetate into citrate, leaving CoA free.In the same metabolic cycle, succinyl-CoA is converted into succinate and freeCoA by the action of succinyl-CoA synthetase.
Matrixsuccinyl-CoA may also be condensed with glycine by 5-aminolevulinate synthase to form free CoA and aminolevulinate, which is the first step in heme synthe-sis. 154Especially in liver during fasting, mitochondrial acetyl-CoA derived from β-oxidation may be used for the biosynthesis of the ketone bodies acetoacetate andβ-hydroxybutyrate, which are activated and oxidized in other tissues with the production of ATP.153Further- more, acetyl-CoA (via malonyl-CoA) is utilized in mito-chondrial type II fatty acid synthesis for the production of lipoate, which acts as a cofactor in the E2 component of the matrix dehydrogenase complexes.155In addition, mitochondrial acetyl-CoA may be used for regulatorypurposes through acetylation of proteins and the produc- tion of the urea cycle regulator N-acetylglutamate.156,157 The above-mentioned mitoch ondrial enzymes associate or disassociate CoA from acyl chains without changing the CoA moiety itself.
However, mi tochondria also contain thePALMIERI ET AL . 603 NUDIX protein NUDT8, which hydrolyses CoA (or acyl- CoAs) to phosphopantetheine (or acyl-phosphopantetheine)and PAP, exhibiting the same function in CoA degradation as its peroxisomal homologues NUDT7 and NUDT19.158It seems most likely that NUDT8 is localized in the matrix,but it cannot be excluded that it is in the intermembrane space.
141T h ef a c tt h a ta l s oC O A S Ym a yb el o c a t e di nt h e matrix implies that the result ed phosphopantetheine may be recycled into CoA; in this case, however, NUDT8 and COASY activities must be regulated to avoid a futile cycle of CoA synthesis and breakdown.158,141Moreover, mito- chondrial type II fatty acid synt hesis of lipoate requires acyl carrier protein (ACP), which i s modified covalently with a phosphopantetheinylate group derived from CoA, by pho- sphopantetheinyl transfer ase producing PAP as a leaving group.155In yeast, phosphopantetheinyl transferase is local- ized in mitochondria, where as the corresponding enzyme in human appears to be cytoplasmic. Besides being anintermediate in lipoate synthesis, acetylated ACP (via the phosphopantetheine group) seems to have a role in mito- chondrial translation, iron –sulfur cluster biogenesis and assembly of the respiratory chain complexes.
155Thus, if human NUDT8 and phosphopantetheinyl transferase are located in the mitochondrial matrix, PAP, the breakdownproduct of CoA, may be exported from the mitochondrialmatrix by SLC25A42. 10 3.4 |Diseases related to CoA In humans, pantothenate deficiency due to low intake of the vitamin (RDA 5 to 10 mg) is a very rare disorder that causes asthenia, headaches, nauseas and vomiting, as well as some forms of neuropathies similar to those ofother vitamin B deficiencies.159Mutations in PANK2 and COASY give rise to neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation.160Homozygous mutations in SLC25A42 cause variable symptoms with wide spectrum of severity,even among patients with the same mutation in the same family, including lactic acidosis, mitochondrial myopathy with muscle weakness, encephalopathy, developmentalregression and epilepsy.
161–163The identified disease- causing mutations are a splice site and a point mutation (p.Asn291Asp) close to the substrate-binding site (for areview, see Reference 64). 4|FLAVIN ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE (FAD) FAD is an important cofactor in redox reactions catalysed by flavoproteins, which contain FAD, or its mononucleotide form FMN, and play key roles in cell metabolism.FADconsists of a riboflavin moiety (vitamin B2 or previously vitamin G), a flavin isoalloxazine ring bound to the reducedpentose ribitol, that with one phosphate attached forms FMN or two phosphates and adenosine forms FAD (Figure 1c).Two nitrogen atoms (in positions 1 and 5) in the conjugated 3 six-membered ring system of riboflavin have the ability of accepting a p roton and an electron, each giving the fully reduced form of FAD and FMN.FAD worksas a prosthetic group in flavoproteins, to which it is most often bound non-covalently.
4.1 |FAD biosynthesis and distribution The FAD precursor riboflavin is not synthesized by ani- mals but by bacteria, fungi and plants where its synthesis starts from GTP and ribulose-5-phosphate.164In humans riboflavin is mainly taken up in small intestine from foodsuch as meat, cereals, fish, dark-green vegetables, egg, nuts, mushrooms, legumes, milk and dairy products. 165 Food processing and exposure to UV light may reduce riboflavin content.In the small intestine, FAD and FMN are hydrolysed to riboflavin, which is mainly absorbed by SLC52A3 (RFVT3) in the proximal small intestine and, tosome extent, in the large intestine.166Also, the homo- logues of this transporter, SLC52A1 and SLC52A2, with 86% sequence identity between them and about 42% with SLC52A3, may contribute to intestinal absorption,enterocyte export, blood cell import/export and cellular uptake of riboflavin (Figure 4).167,168In blood riboflavin is transported bound to albumin or in erythrocytes andleukocytes.
Imported cellular riboflavin is phosphorylated by ribo- flavin kinase (RFK, ATP-riboflavin 5 0phosphotransferase) to form FMN, which is subsequently adenylated by FADsynthase (FADS, ATP-FMN adenylyltransferase) to FAD (Figure 4).169Whereas RFK is thought to be cytoplasmic, FADS has been suggested to have two isoforms in human,one cytoplasmic and one mitochondrial. 170In yeast, there is only one isoform of FADS, which may be localized both to the cytoplasm and mitochondria due to a cis-acting mito-chondrial localization motif present in the 3 0-untranslated region of its mRNA.171,172FAD is distributed in different cellular compartments: cytoplasm, peroxisomes, ER,nucleus, lysosomes and mitochondria.
Very limited exam- ples of processes in which FAD is involved are: cytochrome P 4 5 0r e d u c t a s ea n dn i t r i co x i d es y n t h a s e2i nt h ec y t o -sol 173,174;β-oxidation of fatty acids, D-amino acid and sarcosine oxidases in peroxisomes145; degradation of pro- teins and formation of disulfide bonds in the ER175,176;h i s - tone lysine demethylases in the nucleus177; amino acid and prenyl-cysteine oxidases in lysosomes178,179; and many enzymes involved in carbohydrate, fatty acid and amino604 PALMIERI ET AL . acid catabolism, such as succi nate dehydrogenase (complex II), in mitochondria.168Moreover, in chloroplasts, FAD is used by acetolactate synthase and for fatty acid biosynthe- sis.70These compartmentalized FAD-requiring processes suggest that FAD, or one of its precursors, has to be impo- rted into these organelles.SLC25A17 and SLC25A32 havebeen identified as transporters for FAD (and/or FMN) in peroxisomes,146and in mitochondria,180,181respectively.

605 by the EPRA method, display the ability of transporting FAD and FMN although at a lower extent than their othersubstrates NAD +,N A A D ,N M N ,A D Pa n dA M P( d e s c r i b e d in more detail in Section 5.2).182 4.2 |Mitochondrial FAD transport FLX1 (flavin exchange) has been suggested to import FAD into mitochondria and hence be the yeast mito- chondrial carrier for FAD5for the following reasons: (a) a respiratory defective mutant strain of S. cerevisiae was shown to have low mitochondrial FAD/FMN ratio; (b) the gene responsible for this phenotype was identified as FLX1; (c) mitochondrial vesicles from wild-type cellsdisplayed more efficient transport of FAD than those from the flx1 mutant strain; and (d) yeast FADS was thought to be located in the cytoplasm.
The closest human homologue of FLX1, SLC25A32 (29% sequence identity), was originally suggested to trans- port folate (vitamin B9) and named mitochondrial folatecarrier (MFT), because of its ability to complement glycine auxotrophy of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO GlyB cells) with diminished mitochondrial folate levels. 6 Later, human SLC25A32 was shown to rescue growthdefects and succinate dehydrogenase activity of the flx1 mutant strain.180The same authors suggested that mito- chondrial FAD is necessary for dimethylglycine dehydroge-nase and sarcosine dehydrogenase, which are involved in one-carbon metabolism in connection to the folate cycle, catalysing the conversion of choline to glycine.Further-more, FAD is also the cofactor of other enzymes involved in folate metabolism such as methylene THF reductase or the glycine clevage system.These grounds might explainthe previous observations and the suggestion thatSLC25A32 is a folate transporter.
Also an Arabidopsis homologue of SLC25A32, At5g66380, which is located in chloroplasts, has been suggested to be a folate transporterbased on complementation of CHO GlyB cells. 183Unfortu- nately, no direct evidence for transport of FAD, FMN, folate or other substrates has yet been reported with isolated yeastFLX1, human SLC25A32 or Arabidopsis At5g66380.There- fore, it is not known whether these transporters are uniporters or antiporters and, given the possibility thatFADS is located both in cytoplasm and mitochondria, 171,170 it is also not clear whether they have a role in mitochon-drial FAD (or FMN) export.4.3 |Role of FAD in mitochondria FAD is an important cofactor for several mitochondrial matrix enzymes, mostly catabolic dehydrogenases.In these reactions, FAD is reduced to FADH 2by accepting twoelectrons and two protons (Figure 4).The electrons of FADH 2in integral membrane flavoproteins are directly transferred onto ubiquinone, sometimes via other electron transfer groups.
One example of membrane flavoprotein is complex II, succinate dehydro genase, which catalyses the conversion of succinate to fumarate in the TCA cycle and to which FAD is covalently linked to a histidine residue,184 whereas complex I NADH dehydrogenase contains FMN. Two other inner membrane bound mitochondrial flavopro- teins, involved in proline/hydroxy-proline catabolism, are proline dehydrogenase (PRODH), which converts prolinetoΔ 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, a nd hydroxyproline dehydro- genase (HYPDH), which transforms hydroxyproline, derived from collagen, to Δ1-pyrroline-3-hydroxy-5-carbox- ylate.185,186FADH 2of soluble flavoproteins is re-oxidized to FAD by electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) onto ETF ubi- quinone oxidoreductases (ETFQO), which transfers the electrons onto ubiquinone for the inner membrane-embedded electron transport chain.
One example of a solu- ble matrix flavoprotein is the E3 component (dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, DLD), which is i d e n t i c a lf o ra l lf o u rd i f f e r - ent 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes (PDHc, OGDHc, OADHc and BCKDHc) as discussed in Section 2.3. Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase is also part of the glycinecleavage system (GCS), involved in glycine metabolism.187 Nine other soluble mitochondrial FAD-dependent enzymes are involved in (a) fatty acid β-oxidation, (b) BCAA catabo- lism and (c) amino acid catabolism.These include: (a) acyl-CoA dehydrogenases for various acyl-chain lengths (short-, medium-, long-, and very-long-chain; SCADH, MCADH, L C A D Ha n dV L C A D H )a sw e l la sA C A D 9( a c y l - C o Ad e h y -drogenase 9); (b) isovaleryl-CoA, isobutyryl-CoA, and short branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (IVDH, IBDH and SBCADH); and (c) glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase(GCDH).
168Other mitochondrial soluble flavoenzymes are L- and D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenases (2HGDH),188,189which are keeping the levels of toxic 2-hydroxyglutarate low, as well as choline dehydrogenase(CDH), dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH) 190and sarcosine dehydrogenase (SDH),191which are involved in choline metabolism. In addition, mitochondrial FAD isinvolved in heme biosynthesis (protoporphyrinogen oxi- dase PPOX), redox control (thioredoxin reductase TRXR2), sulfur metabolism (SQOR), complex I assembly/subcomplex (FXRD1, NDUFA10, NDUA9 and ACAD9), ubiquinone biosynthesis (COQ6), adenosylcobalamin bio- synthesis (MMAB) and mitochondrial tRNA modifica-tions (MTO1).4.4 |Diseases related to FAD The RDA of riboflavin is about 0.9 –1.3 mg/day for adults: a daily intake less than 0.6 mg may lead to vitamin B2606 PALMIERI ET AL .
deficiency (ariboflavinosis), which is manifested by gen- eralized weakness, angular stomatitis, glossitis, cheilosis,corneal vascularization, photophobia and, in severe cases, generalized seborrhoeic dermatitis. 192–194Disease- causing mutations have been identified in the genesencoding the riboflavin transporters SLC52A1 –3, mito- chondrial SLC25A32, FADS1, ETF α, ETF βand ETFQO.168Mutations in the latter three proteins, which are involved in the mitochondrial re-oxidation of FAD (Figure 4), give rise to a group of three severe disorders called multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies(MADD I-III, respectively).These disorders involve mul-tiple organs such as muscle, heart and liver, and are char- acterized by the accumulation of organic acids in urine, acylcarnitines and amino acids in plasma due to theircompromised catabolism.168 SLC25A32 deficiency (OMIM 616839) has been found in two patients, of which one displayed milder symptomsand the other more severe.
The milder case exhibited recurrent late-onset exercise intolerance and biochemical features similar to those of MADD patients. 181The patient had compound heterozygous SLC25A32 muta- tions: a premature stop codon and a conservative mis- sense mutation (p.Arg147His) in the second positivelycharged residue of the second signature motif sequence.The expression of the missense mutant protein could complement the defects in the yeast flx1mutant strain only partly.181The more severe case had a neuromuscu- lar phenotype that manifested early onset ataxia, myoclonia and dysarthria besides muscle weakness, exer- cise intolerance and MADD metabolites.195This patient had a homozygous indel mutation causing loss of the translational start codon and consequent loss of SLC25A32 expression or the use of an alternative startcodon and production of a dysfunctional SLC25A32.Ifthe former possibility is true, it might be that matrix FAD is not only provided through this carrier.
For MAADIII and the disorders caused by mutations in riboflavin/FADtransporters SLC25A32 and SLC52A1 –3, diet sup- plemented with riboflavin is a quite effective treatment improving the prognosis of patients. 168 5|NICOTINAMIDE ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE (NAD+) Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a redox cofactor used by hundreds of enzymes because of itscapacity to act as an electron donor and acceptor in its reduced (NADH) and oxidized (NAD +) form, respec- tively.In addition, NAD+is also used by non-redox enzymes, such as sirtuins and poly(ADP-ribose) polymer- ases for protein deacylation and ADP-ribosylationreactions, respectively.It is formed by AMP and nicotin- amide mononucleotide (NMN) linked through theirphosphates (Figure 1).NMN consists of a riboside, which is linked to nicotinamide through its 10-carbon (together forming nicotinamide riboside), and a 50-phosphate.
Nic- otinamide and nicotinamide riboside together with nicotinate (nicotinic acid or niacin) are different forms of vitamin B3. The oxidized form NAD+has a positive charge on N1 of nicotinamide (along with the two nega- tive charges on the phosphates), whereas the reduced form NADH has accepted two electrons and one proton(together a hydride ion), giving rise to neutralized N1and an additional hydrogen added onto C4 of the nicotin- amide ring.Unlike FAD, which is most often tightly bound to their flavoproteins, NAD +is loosely bound to their proteins, and in many cases the NAD+binding domain has a Rossman fold.5.1 |NAD+biosynthesis and distribution There are several routes of NAD+biosynthesis in animals that require the absorption of at least one of the essentialprecursors: the different forms of vitamin B3 or the essen-tial amino acid tryptophan.
Intestinal absorption of vita- min B3 derivatives is mediated by SLC5A8, SLC22A13, SLC12A8 and SLC29 family members, whereas trypto-phan is taken up by SLC7A5, SLC36A4 and other trans- porters (Figure 5).196,197The majority of NAD+is produced by the Preiss –Handler pathway initiating from nicotinate.198NAD+may also be synthesized de novo from tryptophan by the kynurenine pathway, which is thought to operate mainly in liver producing nicotin-amide that can be exported to many different tissues andconverted into NAD +by the NAD+salvage pathway. Nicotinamide is also formed by the action of extracellular NAD+glycohydrolases (NADases: CD38 and CD73/ CD157) and by the intracellular non-redox NAD+- dependent enzymes.199Furthermore, NAD+may be repristinated by other salvage pathways from NMN andnicotinamide riboside.198It is noteworthy that NAD+ homeostasis has been shown to be crucial in health, andseveral diseases are associated with its unbalance.
200,201 Intracellular NAD+is especially involved in reactions catalysed by dehydrogenases in multiple catabolic path- ways, including glycolysis, glutaminolysis and fatty acidβ-oxidation (Figure 5). The reducing equivalents of cyto- solic NADH, produced, for example, from glycolysis, are shuttled across the mitochondrial membrane by the clas- sic malate –aspartate and glycerol-3-phosphate shuttles,202–204to intramitochondrial NAD+, which is re- oxidized to NAD+by complex I of the respiratory chain.PALMIERI ET AL .
607 NAD+is distributed in all cellular compartments; mea- sures indicate a cytosolic free NAD+concentration of about 0.1 mM and twice as much in mitochondria.205 However, other measures indicate 0.3 –0.8 mM total cellu- lar NAD+.206In the nucleus, NAD+is required for the de-acetylation of histones mediated by sirtuins andpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, which are involved in DNA damage repair.198MC family members have been identified to be responsible for mitochondrial and peroxi- somal import of NAD+from the cytoplasm. In peroxi- somes, human SLC25A17 and plant PXN have been shown to transport NAD+along with other nucleotides FIGURE 5 NAD+metabolism and transport in a typical human cell.The schematic overview shows NAD+, vitamin B3 and tryptophan transporters (yellow), NAD+-using enzymes (red), enzymes metabolizing NAD+(olive green), enzymatic reactions (black arrows), reactions with unidentified enzymes (grey arrows) and distribution (red arrows).

and cofactors.146,147,207In animal mitochondria, net import of NAD+is catalysed by NAD+transporters that will be described briefly here, because they have been treated thoroughly in a recent review.49 5.2 |Mitochondrial NAD+transport The EPRA method has been used to identify and charac- terize two NAD+transporter isoforms of the MC family inS. cerevisiae (Ndt1p and Ndt2p)9and in A.thaliana (AtNDT1 and AtNDT2),182whereas genetic approaches and indirect biochemical and complementation assays were used to identify the human SLC25A51 as NAD+ transporter.11–13 Yeast Ndt1p and Ndt2p localize to mitochondria, as shown by GFP-fusion protein constructs.
Ndt1p trans- ports NAD+(Km of 0.38 mM) as well as (d)AMP, (d) GMP, NAAD and several other nucleotides to a lesser extent.9Both Ndt1p and Ndt2p deletion strains display growth defects on non-fermentable carbon sources andreduced mitochondrial NAD +levels; in double knockout cells these levels are even further decreased.9,208Based on these results, it was suggested that the main physiologicalrole of Ndt1p and Ndt2p is mitochondrial NAD +import in exchange for (d)AMP or (d)GMP.9 The plant AtNDT1 and AtNDT2, which have 26 –34% sequence identity with their yeast homologues, transportNAD +(Km values of 0.25 and 0.15 mM, respectively), NAAD, NMN, ADP and AMP, and less efficiently NAMN, FAD, FMN, and other nucleotides.182AtNDT1 and AtNDT2 are localized to mitochondria, and their expression in yeast Ndt1p- and Ndt2p-deletion strains complements the growth defect and mitochondrialNAD +transport.182,209The plant mitochondrial NAD+ carriers are particularly expressed in energetically active and developing tissues, and their depletion leads to impaired reproduction.182,209,210Therefore, AtNDT1 and AtNDT2 most likely mediate the import of NAD+into mitochondria, possibly in exchange for ADP or AMP.182 Given that the closest human homologue of the yeast and plant NAD+carriers, SLC25A32, does not transport NAD+211and the subcellular localization of the NAD+ biosynthesis enzymes in animals is rather uncertain, the existence of an animal mitochondrial NAD+transporter has been enigmatic for quite a long time.
Several pieces of evidence have recently pointed towards SLC25A51 as amitochondrial NAD +importer (Figure 5), although this carrier has not yet been characterized by direct transport measurements. That SLC25A51, which is ubiquitously expressed in humans and has an isoform with 96%sequence identity (SLC25A52), has a central role in metabolism was demonstrated by SLC25A51 knockoutand knockdown in several cell lines causing defects in mitochondrial respiration, TCA cycle and fatty acidoxidation.
11–13Furthermore, (a) its functional role was linked to other mitochondrial cofactor transporters, the plasma membrane glucose transporter SLC2A1 as well asto one-carbon and glutathione metabolism, (b) SLC25A51 knockdown led to a reduction of mito- chondrial NAD +levels and transport, whereas over- expression of the protein had opposite effects, and (c) reduced mitochondrial respiration and NAD+levels of the human SLC25A51 knockout cells were rescued byexpression of yeast Ndt1p and, vice versa, the growthdefect, diminished mitochondrial NAD +levels and mito- chondrial transport of NAD+was complemented by SLC25A51 expression in the yeast Ndt1/Ndt2 doubleknockout. 11–13SLC25A51 lacks several of the conserved residues found in almost all MCs, and in particular, at variance with nucleotide-transporting MCs, it does nothave G[IVLM] in contact point II nor does it cluster together with them in phylogenetic trees.
49These sequence features make SLC25A51 different from theNAD +carriers of yeast and Arabidopsis as well as from the other MCs for B-vitamin-derived cofactors. Until now, no disease has been associated with SLC25A51.Based on the above-described results, SLC25A51 mostlikely mediates mitochondrial NAD +import.
5.3 |Role of NAD+in mitochondria In the mitochondrial matrix, NAD+is used as a cofactor in redox reactions catalysed by numerous enzymes (Figure 5), for example, the E3 component (di- hydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, DLDH), which is com-mon to all the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes(PDHc, OGDHc, OADHc and BCKDHc) discussed in Section 2.3; other enzymes of, or connected to, the TCA cycle: isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase(also involved in the malate –aspartate shuttle) and malic enzyme; of amino acid catabolism: glutamate dehydroge- nase 2, δ-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (ALDH4A1) and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases (HCD2, DHB8 and HCDH); and of ketone body and alco- hol metabolism: aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH2,AL1B1) and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH). NADH, obtained from most of these reactions, is then re- oxidized to NAD +by complex I, which transfers two elec- trons to the electron transfer chain.
Sirtuins 3 –5 are mitochondrial non-redox enzymes that require NAD+to remove various modifications (e.g., acetylations, lipoylations, biotinylations,succinylations and malonylations) on lysine residues of proteins producing nicotinamide as a byproduct. 212GivenPALMIERI ET AL .609 that the above-mentioned modifications generally cause inhibition of the protein activities, these regulatorysirtuins usually act as activators of enzymes, such as PDHc and LCAD, but also others involved in fatty acid oxidation, BCAA catabolism, TCA cycle, urea cycle, ATPproduction and ketone body synthesis.
In humans, the nicotinamide produced by the sirtuins of the mitochon- drial matrix might be recuperated into NAD +by a sal- vage pathway; an NMN adenylyl transferase (NMNAT3) has been localized to the matrix, but no nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase that would have been requiredfor NAD +recycling.213,214These observations evoke the questions of the other fates of mitochondrial nicotin- amide and NMN (are they also transported?) and an alternative role of NMNAT3.49 6|CONCLUSIONS/PERSPECTIVES In the last two decades, a substantial progress has been made concerning the distribution of the vitamin B-derived cofactors and their metabolism/recycling enzymes in the various cellular compartments, and especially about their transporters across the cellularplasma membrane and the membranes of the intracellu-lar organelles.
In particular, a considerable advance- ment has been reached in the knowledge about how thiamine pyrophosphate, coenzyme A, FAD and NAD + are transported into mitochondria, used by enzymes in alternative ways and recycled. However, as noted in this review, many pieces in the puzzle are missing to com-prehend mitochondrial transport and metabolism of vitamin B-derived coenzymes.Some of the key points listed below should be explored to improve our under-standing of this matter.1.Some mitochondrial enzymes involved in cofactor metabolism/recycling have not yet been identified ortheir subcellular localization is unclear.These uncer- tainties have important consequences on the compre- hension of the transporter functions in vivo.Forexample, in the case that ThPP phosphatase, which transforms ThPP in ThMP, does not exist in mitochon- dria, ThMP would be an unlikely counter-substrate forTPC-mediated ThPP mitochondrial import.
Similarly, if nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, which con- verts nicotinamide in NMN, is not localized within themitochondria, a mitochondrial nicotinamide and/orNMN transporter would be required. Another exam- ple is COASY: if COASY is only localized to the cyto- plasm, SLC25A42 most likely would mediatemitochondrial CoA import; if COASY is dually local- ized in mitochondrial matrix and cytoplasm, thematrix variant could take part in a CoA salvage path- way; and, finally, if COASY is localized only to thematrix, 4 0-phosphopantetheine would have to be imported into mitochondria and SLC25A42 would probably export CoA to the cytoplasm.2.The substrate specificities and modes of transport (uniport/antiport) have not been characterized for the mitochondrial FAD carrier SLC25A32 and NAD+car- rier SLC25A51 by direct transport measurements (e.g., the EPRA method) using purified proteins.
Given the presence of FADS1 in mitochondria, onecould hypothesize that SLC25A32 catalyses FMNimport and FAD export. Under the current state of knowledge, several hypotheses can be made about which NAD +-derivatives are transported by SLC25A51 into the mitochondria and about which, if any, are the counter-substrates.3.Other transporters for the same coenzymes in the inner mitochondrial membrane may exist, especially because other members of the MC family have been shown to have overlapping substrate specificity.Thereare already some clues suggesting that this is the case also for some of the vitamin B-derived coenzyme transporters.The close phylogenetic relationshipbetween SLC25A42 and SLC25A16 as well as betweenSLC25A51, SLC25A52 and SLC25A53 might suggest similar substrates within each of these two groups of carriers.Furthermore, the fact that no growth defectof the S.
cerevisiae tpc1 Δstrain was observed when grown on non-fermentable carbon sources suggests the existence of another mitochondrial ThPP trans-porter. However, there is no close homologue of Tpc1p in yeast, which might indicate that a more dis- tant member of the MC family or a transporterbelonging to another protein family is involved in theimport of ThPP into mitochondria of yeast cells grown on non-fermentable carbon sources.4.The precise physiological roles of the vitamin B- derived coenzyme transporters in vivo remain to be investigated.These studies, which have already started by analyses of single gene overexpression orknockout in cells and model organisms, and are being much helped by the biochemical characterization of the purified transporters and their metabolic context,would benefit from the use of combined pairs/sets of gene knockouts and multiple-parameter analyses of their phenotypes.
Furthermore, an improved andenlarged analysis of the phenotypes of the genetic var-iants causing vitamin B-related pathologies could con- tribute to a better understanding of the physiological roles of the transporters as well as the pathogeneticmechanisms underlying the major symptoms of these diseases. Such knowledge may further be used for610 PALMIERI ET AL .future improvement of disease diagnosis and develop- ment of new therapeutic protocols.5.For the vitamin B-derived coenzymes pyridoxal phos- phate, biotin and cobalamin, no mitochondrial trans- porter has been identified yet.This is anotherinteresting area of future research that might involve members of transporter families different from the MC family.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Research in the authors' laboratories was supportedby (a) PRIN 2017 (2017PAB8EM) and PRIN 2020(2020RRJP5L) grants from the Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca (MIUR), and (b) Centre of Excellence on Comparative Genomics (CEGBA).
