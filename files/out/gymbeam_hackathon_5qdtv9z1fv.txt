Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modi ﬁed Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separatedby a 6-week washout period.We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomicsto pro ﬁle serum and CSF and metagenomics pro ﬁling on fecal samples.While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to signi ﬁcant alterations in both serum and CSF.These changes included improved modi ﬁable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels,and a reduction in systemic in ﬂammation.
Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels.Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum,suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our ﬁndings highlight that MMKD can improve AD- related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolicchanges across the blood-CSF barrier.Alzheimer ’s disease (AD) is the ﬁfth-leading cause of death in Americans over the age of 651.Despite recent advancements with the approval of novel therapeutics, there remains no cure o r established preventive therapy for AD2–5.
While age, genetics, and family history are prominent risk factors for the development of AD6,7, environmental and lifestyle factors signi ﬁcantly inﬂuence onset, progression, and severity of the disease8.M o d i ﬁable con- ditions such as hypertension9, type 2 diabetes mellitus10, and dyslipidemia11 have been identi ﬁed as risk factors for AD, highlighting the potential for protective measures before the clinical onset of symptoms. Dietary andrelated lifestyle interventions have emerged over the last decades as a way to mitigate such modi ﬁable metabolic risk factors12.One dietary approach that has gained recent attention is the ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that has been successfully usedto treat drug-resistant epilepsy 13,14and showed promising results in cancer therapy15,16.In KD, the metabolic system is rewired to use fat as the primary source of energy instead of carbohydrates.
Catabolism of fat via lipolysisleads to the production of ketone bodies, which replace glucose as the body ’s main fuel source 15. Consequently, KD induces various system-wide A full list of af ﬁliations appears at the end of the paper.*A list of authors and their af ﬁliations appears at the end of the paper.e-mail: suzcraft@wakehealth.edu ; rima.kaddurahdaouk@duke.edu ;jak2043@med.cornell.edu npj Metabolic Health and Disease | (2024) 2:15 11234567890():,; 1234567890():,; metabolic alterations which lead to positive health bene ﬁts, including increased insulin sensitivity17, weight reduction in overweight individuals, and improved lipid pro ﬁles18.
KD has also been linked to neuroprotective effects, including the promotion of more ef ﬁcient mitochondrial activity and reduction of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species19,a sw e l la sa decrease in neuronal excitotoxicity20,21.G i v e nt h er o l eo fm e t a b o l i cd y s r e - gulation, oxidative stress, and excit otoxicity in the pathogenesis of AD13,t h e potential metabolic shifts related to KD could provide bene ﬁcial alterations in disease progression19,22. However, there have been only a few KD studies in humans that characterize its metabolic effects, and none employedmetabolic pro ﬁling in blood and CSF simultaneously 23,24.A ss u c h ,t h e potential impact of a KD on the syste mic and central nervous system- speciﬁc metabolic dysregulation of AD remains uncertain.In this study, we characterized the p eripheral and central metabolic effects of dietary interventions i n participants at risk for AD (Table 1).
We used samples from a randomized crossover pilot trial of a Modi ﬁed Medi- terranean Ketogenic Diet (MMKD) or t he American Heart Association Diet (AHAD) (Fig. 1) in a cohort of prediabetic par ticipants that were either mildly cognitively impaired (MCI, n= 9) or cognitively normal (CN, n= 10)20.In a series of studies using the same cohort, we previously found that MMKD leads to improvements in memory performance alongsideincreased A β42 and decreased tau in CSF 20,c h a n g e si nt h eg u t microbiome21, and reversal of serum-based AD-associated lipid signature25.In the current study, we broaden the s cope of blood biomarkers by using an NMR-metabolomics platform that measured amino acids, ketone bodies,triglycerides, and lipoprotein levels a nd lipoprotein composition.Moreover, this is the ﬁrst exploration of diet-related metabolic changes in CSF.
In both serum and CSF, we determine the MMKD -associated molecular changes, discuss their association to AD pathology, and outline their potential to counteract modi ﬁable risk factors. Results MMKD alters serum levels of amino acids, in ﬂammatory mar- kers, and lipoproteins For both MMKD and AHAD, linear mixed-effects models were used to assess diet-induced changes, with me tabolites as outcomes, the diet time- point (pre/post), cognitive status, and a diet-cognition interaction term aspredictors, and a subject-based random effect.The interaction term wasincluded to examine whether there was a relationship between the effect of diet and cognitive status on a metabolite ’s abundance; for example, if the direction or magnitude of a metabolite ’s change due to the ketogenic diet was affected by a subject ’s cognitive status.
For the AHAD, no metabolites were found to be signi ﬁcantly changed from pre- to post timepoints in serum or CSF (Supplementary Tables 2 and 4) and will thus not be furtherdiscussed. In the MMKD, we found 38 metabolites that associated with diet and 92 metabolites that associated with cogn itive status (false discovery rate, FDR < 20%; see Fig.2a and Supplementary Table 1).Glycine was the only metabolite associated with both diet and cognitive status, and no metabolitesshowed an interaction between the two factors (Supplementary Table 1).Of the metabolites whose abundance was signi ﬁcantly affected by the MMKD, we focused on changes with potentia l relevance to metabolic impairment in AD: Ketone bodies .We detected an increase in serum ketone bodies namely acetone (Log 2fold change, LFC = 1.69, 95% con ﬁdence interval, CI = 1.02 –2.36, adjusted Pvalue, adj.P= 1.5e-2), acetoacetate (LFC = 2.20, adj.P= 1.2e-2), and 3-hydroxybutyrate (LFC = 2.98, adj.
P=7 e - 3 ) , for individuals consuming the ketogenic diet, while serum glucose levelsdecreased (LFC = −0.10, 95% CI = −0.18 to −0.02, adj. P= 1.7e-1, Fig.2a).This aligns with the expected impact of a ketogenic diet, which is known to shift the body ’s metabolism towards utilization of ketone bodies as an energy source instead of glucose 26.Remarkably, previous studies using the UK Biobank cohort (UKBB) have shown a positiveassociation of plasma ketone bodies with Alzheimer ’sd i s e a s e incidence 27.While the mechanism behind this relationship is unclear, beyond the context of a ketogenic diet, ketone bodies are produced as aresponse to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes, and conditions ofoxidative stress and hypoxia 28.
Since people with type 2 diabetes have an increased incidence of AD, the positive association between ketonebodies and AD in UKBB could be mediated by the prevalence of type 2diabetes 29.Table 1 | BEAM study participant summary statistics Characteristic Overall, N=19aFirst diet AHAD, N=8aFirst diet MMKD, N=11a Gender Female 14 (74%) 6 (75%) 8 (73%)Male 5 (26%) 2 (25%) 3 (27%) Age 64.0 (62.0, 66.5) 63.0 (62.0, 65.0) 65.0 (60.5, 67.0)Cognitive status CN 10 (53%) 5 (63%) 5 (45%)MCI 9 (47%) 3 (38%) 6 (55%) Weight change −10.3 (−13.8,−7.6)−7.8 (−12.4,−5.8)−11.2 (−14.4,−9.3) FCSRT score change 2.0 ( −0.5, 4.0) 2.0 (0.0, 2.5) 2.0 ( −1.5, 4.0) CNcognitively normal, MCI mild cognitively impaired, FCSRT free and cued selective reminding test. an(%); median (IQR).Eight individuals were assigned AHAD as their ﬁrst diet (second diet MMKD) and 11 individuals were assigned MMKD as their ﬁrst diet.

P=3 e - 2), while leucine and isoleucine levels remained unaffected (Fig. 2b).Previous research in limited cohorts has indicated that plasma BCAAlevels tend to increase during fasting and short periods ofstarvation 31,32.Both fasting and the ketogenic diet lead to ketogenesis, potentially related to elevated BCAA levels33.However, the reason for the observed increase in only valine levels within the BCAAs remainsunclear.BCAAs have drawn particular attention as a decrease in theirabundance in the blood has been linked to cognitive decline 34,p r o - gression of Parkinson ’sd i s e a s e( P D )35, and incident dementia27.O u r results suggest that a ketogenic diet may help rectify this imbalance byraising valine levels.Notably, in addition to diet, the gu t microbiome also contributes to BCAA biosynthesis 36, and in PD, changes in the microbiome composition have been shown to be associated with BCAA levels35.
In our study, post- MMKD, there was an increase in the abundance of gut microbiome speciespositively associated with serum B CAA compared to AHAD. Furthermore, species with genomes that encode for BCAA biosynthesis were notably more enriched after the keto diet (Fig.2c).These ﬁndings implicate diet- directed gut microbiome modi ﬁcation that provides an alternative source of BCAA.GlycA .Serum glycoprotein acetylation (GlycA) levels were decreased after following a ketogenic diet (LFC = −0.14, adj.P= 2.1e-2).GlycA is an indicator of systemic in ﬂammation as it measures the glycosylation of acute phase reactant proteins which the liver releases in response to pro-inﬂammatory cytokines 37,38.GlycA levels have been associated with worse global cognitive performance in a population of middle-aged and olderadults ( n= 15,105) 39, which aligns with other ﬁndings of an overall association between in ﬂammation and cognitive impairment40,41.
The reduction of GlycA due to MMKD may indicate the diet ’s anti- inﬂammatory effects, which may provide neuroprotection42,43. Lipoprotein size and lipid composition .The total concentration of HDL particles did not signi ﬁcantly change due to MMKD, but the average HDL particle size signi ﬁcantly increased, corresponding with increased concentrations of large and extra-large HDL particles (L-HDL:LFC = 0.48, adj.P= 1.8e-1, XL-HDL: LFC = 0.42, adj.P= 1.8e-1, Fig.2d).These particle size changes are accompanied by a signi ﬁcant increase in total HDL cholesterol (HDL-C: LFC = 0.15, adj.P= 1.8e-1), indicating that the increase in size of these particles may have been due to an increasein their cholesterol content.HDL particles are integral players in thereverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway, as they deliver excesscholesterol stores from peripheral tissues to the liver via the plasma,which is then excreted through the bile 44.
Midlife HDL-C levels have been found to be inversely associated with late-life MCI and dementia, indi- cating that an increase in HDL-C, as seen with the MMKD, could beprotective against cognitive decline 45. Washout period .To ensure the absence of long-term effects of the diets on the serum metabolic pro ﬁles, we compared the metabolic abundances at baseline and after the washout period.None of the metabolites sig-niﬁcantly differed between the onset of the ﬁrst diet and the onset of the second (Supplementary Table 5).Further, to examine how the order ofthe diets may have affected the metabolites impacted by MMKD, effectsizes, and fold changes for each metabolite were compared between thetwo groups (assigned AHAD ﬁrst or MMKD ﬁrst, Supplementary Fig.1).
For the metabolites that associated with MMKD, both the beta estimates from the differential abundance analysis and the fold changeswere largely consistent across the two groups, however there was aslightly muted effect for MMKD as the second diet (SupplementaryFig. 2).MMKD changes levels of amino acids in CSF The Nightingale platform measured 28 metabolites in the CSF.In total, 18out of these 28 metabolites were signi ﬁcantly changed (FDR < 5%) after MMKD (Fig.3), but no metabolites were diff erent due to cognitive status, nor any signi ﬁcant metabolic interactions b etween the two (Supplementary Table 3).Comparing the MMKD-affected metabolites in CSF to theircounterparts in serum where applicable, isoleucine and glutamine were theonly metabolites that signi ﬁcantly changed in the same direction due to the diet (Fig.3a).Amino acids .Amino acids that were increased in the CSF after con- sumption of the MMKD were tyrosine (LFC = 0.62, adj.P= 1.8e-5), phenylalanine(LFC = 0.48, adj.
P= 2.2e-4), and isoleucine (LFC = 0.59, adj.P= 1.1e-5), while glutamine (LFC = −0.16, adj. P= 2.6e-3) and valine (LFC = −0.37, adj.P= 4.8e-2) were decreased.This pattern of changes in CSF amino acids shows the opposite effect of the MMKD seen in serum, where we observed a systemic decrease in amino acids and an increase inBCAAs.Our previous metabolomic analysis of postmortem brain tissuehas shown a positive correlation between BCAAs with AD traits 46.BCAA degradation .Following consumption of the MMKD, there was a marked increase in CSF concentrations of BCAA degradationproducts 47,48including 3-hydroxyisobutyrate (LFC = 1.109, adj.P= 3.9e- 7), 2-hydroxyisovalerate (LFC = 0.13, adj.P= 2.6e-3), 2-ketoisovalerate (LFC = 0.2, adj.P= 9.7e-4), and 3-hydroxyisovalerate (LFC = 1.1, adj.P= 2.3e-4).This, along with the decreased concentrations of valine in CSF following MMKD, suggests an increased BCAA catabolism (Fig.3b).
BCAA degradation plays a major role in generating energy substrates forthe tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, indicating that an MMKD-inducedincrease in BCAA degradation could lead to altered energetic pathwaysin CSF 49. To assess the role of the identi ﬁed MMKD-altered CSF metabolites in relation to the pathology of AD and dem entia, an extensive literature review was performed.The few existing studi es examining AD-associated meta- bolic dysregulation in CSF show limited coverage and inconclusive if notconﬂicting results 50–53.Using valine as an example, Ibáñez et al.53used capillary-electrophoresis mass spectrometry on the CSF of 85 subjects and f o u n da ni n c r e a s eo fv a l i n ei nt h eC S Fi ns u b j e c t sd i a g n o s e dw i t hA D ,w h i l e Berezhnoy et al.54found a decrease in CSF valine in AD patients after performing NMR metabolomics on the CSF of 71 patients.
It is thereforeunclear how the observed alterations in CSF induced by an MMKD mayaffect AD disease development or progression. The linear mixed-effect model beta coef ﬁcients and fold changes for CSF metabolites impacted by MMKD w ere also compared between the group assigned AHAD ﬁrst or MMKD ﬁrst (Supplementary Fig.2).Both the beta estimates from the differential ab undance analysis and the fold changes were largely consistent across the two groups.MMKD-induced metabolic changes show cross-compartmental relationships After establishing the metabolic signature of the MMKD in serum and CSF, we investigated the crosstalk between the two.The blood-CSF barrier isrequired to maintain the c omposition of the CSF, thereby sustaining the homeostasis necessary for the pr oper functioning of the brain 55.Conse- quently, only selected molecules essential to brain function are able to crossthis barrier.
Given this tightly regul ated barrier, a one-to-one correspon- dence of metabolites across the compartments is unlikely. However, weexpect a systemic coregulation of central and peripheral metabolism.To assess this, we performed a correlation network analysis on the magnitude of changes between all metabolites affected by the MMKD, deﬁned as the difference between metabolite ’s pre- and post-diet abun- dance.This analysis models the functional relationship between two cross-compartmental metabolites by captur ing how similar metabolites change due to the MMKD.There were 43 signi ﬁcant correlations (FDR < 5%), 20 of which were between CSF metabolites and serum ketone bodies (Fig.4).Ofhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44324-024-00016-3 Article npj Metabolic Health and Disease | (2024) 2:15 4 a.

Speci ﬁcally, in contrast to serum measurements, 3-hydroxybutyrate levels in the CSF did not show signi ﬁcant alterations post-MMKD.A potential reason for thi s discrepancy could be the effective utilization of ketone bodies in the brain, requiring the conversion of3-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate and thus potentially stabilizing the CSF levels of acetoacetate 56.In addition, compared to 3-hydroxybutyrate, acet- oacetate is estimated to have double th e transport rate through the BBB via MCT (monocarboxylate transporter), e xhibiting competitive inhibition of the transport of 3-hydroxybutyrate56–58.
This is further supported by a previously reported PET-based ana lysis on this cohort which showed an increase in one of the ketone bodies, a cetoacetate, in the brain following MMKD20. Overall, these relationships between serum ketone bodies and CSF metabolites con ﬁrm our hypothesis that the ketogenic diet leads to con- current changes in metabolites across the blood-CSF barrier.Discussion Modi ﬁable risk factors, such as dietary habits, play a substantial role in the onset and progression of Alzheimer ’s disease (AD)59.Though the keto- genic diet (KD) appears promising in diminishing metabolic threats andpossibly in ﬂuencing AD ’s course 60, only a few studies have delved into KD’s metabolic effects on blood and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF).In this study, we report the metabolic impact of dietary interventions simulta-neously in serum and CSF of patients at risk for AD.
Our study is based on19 prediabetic participants who were on MMKD and AHAD for 6 weekseach with 6 weeks washout period between the two diets. We performedmetabolic pro ﬁling of their serum and CSF samples, as well as metage- nomic pro ﬁling of their fecal samples.Our ﬁndings show that the MMKD had a widespread metabolic impact on both serum and CSF, while the AHAD had minimal impact.Interestingly, the metabolic impact of theMMKD was independent of the cognitive status of the individuals.In thefollowing, we discuss the key ﬁndings of our study indicating the positive impact of MMKD.The changes in serum due to the MMKD show the diet ’sp o t e n t i a lf o r AD metabolic signature reversal.Our ﬁndings show that the MMKD reduces the in ﬂammatory marker GlycA, indicating a decrease in systemic inﬂammation due to the diet.
Systemic in ﬂammatory markers have been shown to have an inverse relation ship with cognitive abilities 39–41,61.F u r - thermore, MMKD altered the BCAA- associated gut microbiome and increased circulating valine levels. B lood valine levels have been shown to be inversely associated with cognitive performance (ADAS-Cog13)62.T h e s e metabolic changes suggest that the MMKD could provide a therapeuticadvantage by reversing the levels of the markers tied to the disease signature.MMKD has the potential to mitigate modi ﬁable risk factors of AD, including those associated with cardiovascular disease and elevated bodymass index (BMI).One of the key charac teristics of a high -fat low-carb diet is its effect on the lipid pro ﬁle 25.In our study, an increase in HDL-C levels was observed post-MMKD.High HDL-C is conducive to improved car-diovascular health, a modi ﬁable risk factor of AD 63.
Moreover, midlife levels of HDL cholesterol show a consistent n egative association with the devel- opment of cognitive impairment later in life45.I na d d i t i o n ,p r e v i o u sw o r ko n this cohort reported that MMKD led to a signi ﬁcant decrease in weight (P<1 e - 6 )20. Overweight and obese body mass index (BMI) in midlife is associated with an increased risk of dementia compared with normal BMI64.Taken together, MMKD which simultaneously increases HDL cholesterol,reduces systemic in ﬂammation, and decreases weight could provide pro- t e c t i o na g a i n s td e v e l o p i n gA Dl a t e ri nl i f e 65.
Post-MMKD alterations in the metabolic pro ﬁle of the CSF point to an increase in amino acid levels besides gl utamine and valine, which decreased; the decrease in valine was accompanied by an increase in BCAA degrada-tion metabolites, indicating a potential upregulation of BCAA catabolism.There is limited research in linking cognitive performance to BCAAs and t h e i rm e t a b o l i s mi nC S Fa n dt h u si ti su n c l e a ri ft h ed y s r e g u l a t i o no fB C A A metabolism in CSF due to the MMKD w ould have any disease-modifying effect. However, we have previously shown that the CSF-based AD-bio-marker pro ﬁle of these individuals improves post-MMKD, as indicated by an increase in A β42 levels (in both MCI and CN) and a decrease in tau (onlyFig.4 | Bipartite graph between CSF and serum metabolites.Each node represents a metabolite whose size re ﬂects the magnitude of its fold change post-MMKD and whose color represents its bio-chemical group.
Ellipses depict metabolites mea- sured in serum, and diamonds represent metabolites measured in CSF. Each edge represents a signi ﬁcant (FDR < 5%) correlation of the magnitude of changes pre- to post-diet between two metabolites and is weighted to re ﬂect the magnitude of that correlation.https://doi.org/10.1038/s44324-024-00016-3 Article npj Metabolic Health and Disease | (2024) 2:15 6 in MCI)20.Therefore, while prior research was unable to link the observed metabolic changes with AD patholo gy, it is likely that post-MMKD meta- bolic changes in CSF contribute to the observed reversal of AD-relatedpathological changes observed in this cohort.Furthermore, when examining the changes induced by MMKD in both serum and CSF, we observed that the diet- related metabolic alterations were linked across the blood-C SF barrier.
The substantial metabolic effects of the MMKD in CSF and the strong relationship between ketone body changes inserum, and CSF metabolites indicate the potential of this dietary interven-tion to alter brain metabolism , which is dysregulated in AD 66. We and others have shown that ketogenic interventions increase ketone body uptake in thebrain 20,67,68.With increased ketone bodies as an energy substitute for glucose in the serum, a similar increase in the brain could be bene ﬁcial to com- pensate for the cerebral glucose hypometabolism in AD.The main limitation of our study is the small sample size, which restricts the generalizability of our results and the power of our associations.
It also limits our ability to incorporat e potential additional covariates in statistical models, such as the APOE4 genotype, a known genetic component of Alzheimer ’sd i s e a s e69, and sex-speci ﬁc effects, as Alzheimer ’sD i s e a s e disproportionally affects women in both prevalence and severity70.C u r - rently, studies extending this interve ntion to a larger cohort are underway (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03472664), and might be able to address theseissues. In addition, the fact that all participants were prediabetic might limit the generalizability of our ﬁndings to metabolically healthy individuals or those with diagnosed Type 2 diabetes; however, it provides a basis to assess metabolic response in those with impai red systemic metabolism.Another limitation of our study is the poor m etabolic coverage in CSF due to the platform used, which only included 28 biomarkers.This limits our ability to obtain a full picture of the impacts of the ketogenic diet on the CSF.
Taken together, our study highligh ts the positive impact of MMKD on metabolic health in the context of AD. We showed that AD-related mod-iﬁable risk factors can be improved, AD- linked metabolic alterations can be partially reversed, and importantly th at diet-related metabolic changes are correlated across the blood-CSF barrier .Extensive mechanistic studies are needed to determine the functional impact of the metabolic changes foundin this study and establish the true th erapeutic potential of the metabolic changes observed post-MMKD.
Methods Study participants In total, 19 individuals were recruited who were at risk for AD based on their baseline cognitive impairment and sys temic metabolic dysfunction; 9 par- ticipants were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) byexperienced physicians and neuropsy chologists using the NIA-AA MCI criteria; the other 10 were categorize d as having subjective memory com- plaints (SMC) but otherwise norm al cognition using the Alzheimer ’sD i s e a s e Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) criteria 71. All participants had prediabetes according to the American Diabetes Asso ciation guidelines, with a screening hemoglobin A1c level of 5.7 –6.4%72.
We excluded individuals who had previously been diagnosed with neurolo gical or neurodegenerative diseases (except for MCI), major psychiatric d isorders (although well-controlled depression was permitted), prior str okes, or who were currently taking diabetes or lipid-lowering medication s, or medications that affect the central nervous system, such as anti-seizure drugs, antipsychotics, or opioids. The study protocol was approved by the Wake Forest Institutional Review Board and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identi ﬁer: NCT02984540).Written informed consent was obtained from all partici- pants and their study partners, and med ical professionals supervised them while the Wake Forest Institutional D ata and Safety Monitoring Committee oversaw safety monitoring.
Diet intervention procedure The study was a pilot trial conducte d in a randomized crossover design, where participants were randomly assigned to follow either the Modi ﬁedMMKD or the American Heart Association Diet (AHAD) for a duration of 6 weeks. This was followed by a 6-week washout period, during whichparticipants resumed their pre-study diet, before switching to the otherassigned diet for another 6 weeks.The i nitial diet assignment was rando- mized using a random number generator.For more detailed information, refer to ref.20.The experimental diet (MMKD) was a modi ﬁed form of the ketogenic diet that is increasingly used to treat medically intractable epilepsy due to itsbetter tolerability and similar effect iveness compared to a traditional keto- genic diet 73.The targeted macronutrient c omposition for the MMKD was 5–10% carbohydrate, 60 –65% fat, and 30% protein.
Participants were instructed to consume less than 20 g of carbohydrates per day and to avoidstore-bought products marketed as “low carbohydrate ”and arti ﬁcially sweetened beverages. They were encou raged to consume extra virgin olive oil,ﬁsh, lean meats, and nutrient-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, nuts, and berries as a source of carbohydrates.The control diet (AHAD) was adapted from the low-fat American Heart Association Diet 74.The target macronutrient composition for the AHAD was 55 –65% carbohydrate, 15 –20% fat, and 20 –30% protein, with a daily fat intake target of less than 40 g/day.Participants were encouraged toconsume plenty of fruits, vegetables, and ﬁber-rich carbohydrates.Based on a 3-day food diary, as well as participants ’body composition and activity level, a registered dietit ian developed personalized daily meal plans for each participant.
Participants received weekly diet education visitseither in-person or over the phone, starting one week before the start of eachdiet and continuing throughout the intervention. Participants were required to maintain a daily food record that was reviewed during these visits.Both diets were designed to be isocaloric and to maintain the participant ’s baseline caloric needs, with the goal of keeping their weight stablethroughout the study.Prior to the onset of dietary intervention, participantscompleted a 7-day physical activity log which was used to estimate theircaloric needs.Participants were ask ed to maintain their exercise and phy- sical activity level throughout the study.Adherence to the diets was assessedusing capillary ketone body (beta-hyd roxybutyrate) measurements using the Nova Max Plus ®and through self-reports from the participants.
Par- ticipants were given a food stipend of $25/week to defray higher food costsand were provided with a daily multivitamin supplement (Centrum ®Sil- ver®) during both diets. The use of supplements such as resveratrol, CoQ10, coconut oil, and curcumin was not allowed during the study.Neuropsychological evaluation At the beginning of the study and after each diet, the participants underwentassessments of immediate and delayed memory, including the Free andCued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) 75, Story Recall (a modi ﬁed version of the episodic memory measure from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised) 76, and the ADAS-Cog1277.Cognitive abilities were evaluated before and after each diet, as well as durin g follow-up.To minimize the effect of learning on cognitive performance, v arious versions of the selected tests were used.Blood/CSF collection and processing Fasting blood samples were taken from each participant before and after completing each diet and during follo w-up.
The samples were collected in tubes and immediately placed on ice. Within 30 min, the tubes were spun ina cold centrifuge at 2200 rpm for 15 min.After that, plasma, serum, and redblood cells were separated into different storage tubes and ﬂash-frozen at a temperature of −80 °C until further analysis.Study participants underwent a lumbar puncture to collect cere- brospinal ﬂuid (CSF) after fasting for 12 h at the beginning of the study and after each diet.Depending on the clinician ’s preference, participants were positioned either in a seated or lateral decubitus positio n.To numb the area, a 25-gauge needle was used to inject 1% lidocaine locally into the L3-4 or L4-5 interspace.A 22-gauge Sprotte needle was then used to withdraw up to25 ml of CSF into sterile polypropylene tubes.The ﬁrst 3 ml of CSF was sent to a local laboratory for cell count, p rotein, and glucose analysis.
Thehttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44324-024-00016-3 Article npj Metabolic Health and Disease | (2024) 2:15 7 remaining CSF was transferred into pre -chilled polypropylene tubes in 0.2- ml aliquots, frozen immediately on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. Nightingale NMR quanti ﬁcation A targeted, high-throughput1H-NMR-metabolomics platform (Nightingale Health Ltd, Helsinki, Finland) was us ed to quantify 250 circulating meta- bolites, lipid, and lipoprotein lipid measures in serum and 28 metabolites inCSF 78.This high-throughput metabolomics platform provides absolute concentration quanti ﬁcation of lipids, lipid concen trations of 14 lipoprotein subclasses and major subfractions, and further abundant fatty acids in serum, as well as amino acids, ketone bodies, and energy-related metabolites in serum and CSF.Of these measurements, 165 are directly measured meta-bolites and 85 are derived measurements related to lipid ratios and lipopro-tein composition.
All measurements are listed in Supplementary Table 2. This NMR platform is based on a standardized protocol described elsewhere 78,79.Statistical analysis Preprocessing serum .In all, 250 biomarkers were measured in 102 serum samples.One biomarker with over 40% missing values was removed from theanalysis.77 biomarker values were reported in percentages, and thus weretransformed using the centered log-ratio (CLR) method typically used withcompositional omics data 80.The remaining biomarkers were log2- transformed.The remaining missing values were imputed using the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm.Four outlier samples were removed using theLOF method, and extreme outlying biomarker values were imputed using a kNN algorithm.There were 19 paired participants in the MMKD diet group a n d1 8p a i r e dp a r t i c i p a n t si nt h eA H Ad i e tg r o u p .Preprocessing CSF .In all, 28 biomarkers were measured in 59 CSF samples.None of the biomarkers or samples had more than 40% missingvalues.
The biomarkers were log2-transformed, and the missing valueswere imputed using the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm. No outlier sam-ples were detected using the LOF method, and extreme outlying bio-marker values were imputed using a kNN algorithm.There were 19paired participants in both diet groups.All preprocessing was performed with the R package maplet ( https:// github.com/krumsieklab/maplet ) 81.Differential abundance analysis .To identify the metabolites altered due to diet, diagnosis, or the interaction of the two, a linear mixed-effect modelwith the form metabolite ~ timepoint *diagnosis +age+sex+(1 | subjectID) was used.The timepoint is a binary variable indicating measurements pre-and post-diet.The analysis was performed per diet and per ﬂuid.Serum measurements were taken both before a nd after participants followed each diet, establishing an individual basel ine for each diet.However, due to the invasive nature of CSF measurements, they were not repeated before thesecond diet.
Instead, the initial CSF me asurements, taken before any dietary intervention, served as a common base line for the evaluation of both diets. P values of the associations were adjusted using the BH method.Due to the low sample size (19) and high number of metabolites (249) tested, for serum-based analysis, a less conservative FDR threshold of 20% was used to deter-mine signi ﬁcance.For CSF, the more string ent threshold of 5% was used as fewer metabolites (28) were tested.All scripts for analysis and plotting areavailable at https://github.com/krum sieklab/keto-beam-ad .Analysis of diet order .To ensure there were no long-term effects of the diets that lasted through the washout period, a paired t-test was per-formed for each serum metabolite, comparing its abundance before theﬁrst diet to its abundance before the second diet (after the washout period, Supplementary Table 5).
Further, to examine how the order of the diets may have affected the metabolites found to be signi ﬁcantly impacted by MMKD, beta coef ﬁcient estimates from the differential abundance analysis and metabolite fold changes were calculated separately for eachof the two groups (assigned AHAD ﬁrst or MMKD ﬁrst) and compared(Supplementary Fig. 1).This process was repeated for the MMKD- associated CSF metabolites (Supplementary Fig.2).Biomarker annotations .Most of the metabolites were grouped using Nightingale-provided annotations.In addition, some metabolic groups were more precisely annotated through further literature review, namelycreatine and creatinine in the ATP cycle 82and branched-chain amino acid degradation products measured in CSF83.Metagenomic sample processing DNA was extracted from stool samples according to Earth MicrobiomeProject protocols 84using the QIAGEN ®MagAttract ®PowerSoil ®DNA KF Kit (384-sample).
A total of 5 ng (or 3.5 µL maximum) genomic DNA wasused in a 1:10 miniaturized Kapa HyperPlus protocol with a 15-cycle PCRampli ﬁcation for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Libraries were quan- tiﬁed with the PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit, and 50 ng (or 1 µL maximum) of each library was pooled.The pool was size selected for 300 –700 bp and sequenced as a paired-end 150-cycle run on an Illumina HiSeq4000 sequencer at the UCSD IGM Genomics Center 85.Metagenomic data processing Shotgun sequencing data were uploaded to and processed by Qiita86(Study ID 13662).Human reads were removed using minimap2 2.1787,w h i l e adapters, quality ﬁltering, and trimming were performed using fastp 20.188.The remaining reads were recruited to the Web of Life database89with Bowtie2 v2.3.090using the parameters from the SHOGUN pipeline91,t h e n processed into Operational Genomic Units with Woltka92.The resulting feature table was used for downstream analysis.
Relative abundance of features analysis We identi ﬁed metagenomic, food-omics, and metabolomic features that are associated with diet and cognition by performing Bayesian inferential regression ( https://github.com/gibsramen/BIRDMAn ). We utilized a Negative Binomial Linear Mixed Effect model to ensure that our statistics agreed with our study design; we model ed time, dietary sequence (whether MMKD intervention was ﬁrst or second), cognitive status, and diet (whether ag i v e ni n d i v i d u a lw a so nM M K Do rA H A Da tag i v e nt i m e p o i n t )a s ﬁxed effects while subject identity was modeled as a random effect.Microbes, food features, and metabolites were ordered by the log-ratio of their relativeabundances in objectively normal cognition to mild cognitive impairmentor MMKD to AHAD individuals, respectively 93,94and the top and bottom ten features were examined more closely21.
Multi-omics analysis To perform a multi-omics analysis in l ine with the repeated-measure study design we performed joint tensor factorization. The complete methodologyincluding mathematical formulas for joint tensor factorization can be foundin Supplementary Methods.Brie ﬂy, each matrix is then transformed, through the centered log-ratio transf ormation (clr) with a pseudo count of 1 to center the data around zero and appr oximate a normal distribution.The joint tensor factorization used here is built upon decomposition of a single temporal tensor using an approximately CP low-rank structure with mul-tiple tensors using a shared subject matrix 95–97.The correlations of all fea- tures across all input matrices are calculated from the ﬁnal estimated matrices.The metabolic capabilities of the microbes were evaluated withMetaCyc 98on the Web of Life genomes89.A n yg e n o m e sc o n t a i n i n gi l v B , ilvC, ilvD, ilvN were considered BCAA biosynthesis containing/encoding35.
