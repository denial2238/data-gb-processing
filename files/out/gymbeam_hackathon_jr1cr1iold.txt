REVIEW Vitamin B-12 and Cognition in Children1–3 Sudha Venkatramanan,4Ilianna E Armata,4Barbara J Strupp,4,5and Julia L Finkelstein4,6* 4Division of Nutritional Sciences and5Department of Psychology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY; and6St.John ’s Research Institute, Bangalore, India ABSTRACT Vitamin B-12 is essential for brain development, neural myelination, and cognitive function.Inadequate vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy and early childhood has been associated with adverse child health outcomes, including impaired cognitive development.However, the underlyingmechanisms have not been elucidated.This review was conducted to examine the evidence that links vitamin B-12 and cognition in children.Thesearch strategy resulted in 17 studies: 3 cross-sectional, 1 case –control, and 12 cohort studies, and 1 randomized trial.Cognitive processes assessed included attention, memory, and perception.
Developmental outcomes, academic performance, and intelligence quotient were also considered.Despite the high prevalence of vitamin B-12 insufficiency and associated risk of adverse cognitive outcomes in children, to our knowledge, no studie s to date have been conducted to examine the effects of vitamin B-12 supplementation on cognition in children. The role of vitamin B-12 in the etiology of child cognitive outcomes needs to be elucidated to inform public health interventions.Adv Nutr 2016;7:879 –88.Keywords: vitamin B-12, cobalamin, child, brain, cognition Introduction Vitamin B-12.Vitamin B-12 is an essential B vitamin that plays an integral role in DNA synthesis, methylation reac-tions, and maintenance of genomic stability (1, 2).Cobal-amin is a cofactor for methionine synthase, an enzyme that converts 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate via remethylation of homocysteine (tHcy) 7to methionine (3).
Methionine synthase is required for the production ofS-adenosylmethionine, which is involved in >100 methyla- tion reactions in the body and is an important methyl donorfor neurotransmitter synthesis and maintenance of cellularintegrity (4). Vitamin B-12 is synthesized by microorganisms, and pri- mary dietary sources are animal-source foods (5).Individ- uals with a low intake of meat and dairy products, such asvegans and vegetarians, are at high risk of vitamin B-12 de-ﬁciency (5).Several studies conducted in low- and middle- income countries also have reported a high prevalence ofvitamin B-12 de ﬁciency, particularly in pregnant womenand young children (6), in part due to inadequate dietary vitamin B-12 intake (7, 8), increased requirements duringpregnancy and lactation, and low vitamin B-12 contentand bioavailability in breast milk (9).
Micronutrient supple-mentation is a common strategy to prevent and treat cobal- amin de ﬁciency (10), and there is emerging interest in mandatory food forti ﬁcation with vitamin B-12 (11). The classic presentation of vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency is he- matologic, as pernicious anemia; inadequate vitamin B-12intake or absorption impairs erythropoiesis (12).Intrinsicfactor, a glycoprotein secreted by the gastric cells, is requiredfor vitamin B-12 transport and absorption (13).In additionto its classic hematologic presentation, cobalamin de ﬁciency also affects neuropsychiatric and cognitive function, partic- ularly in young children and elderly populations (4, 14).Vitamin B-12 biomarkers.Vitamin B-12 assessment in- cludes both circulating and functional vitamin B-12 bio-markers.Circulating biomarkers include total vitaminB-12 and holotranscobalamin, and functional biomarkersinclude methylmalonic acid (MMA) and tHcy (15 –19).
In this review, the following biomarkers of maternal or childvitamin B-12 status were included: plasma or serum total vitamin B-12, holotranscobalamin, MMA, and tHcy. Vitamin B-12 deficiency was defined as serum or plasma total vitaminB-12 concentrations <148 pmol/L, and vitamin B-12 in-sufficiency was defined as vitamin B-12 concentrations<221 pmol/L, unless otherwise specified.1The authors report no funding received for this article.2Author disclosures: S Venkatramanan, IE Armata, BJ Strupp, and JL Finkelstein, no conflicts of interest.3Supplemental Tables 1–4 are available from the "Online Supporting Material" link in the online posting of the article and from the same link in the online table of contents at http://advances.nutrition.org.*To whom correspondence should be addressed.E-mail: jfinkelstein@cornell.edu.7Abbreviations used: BSID, Bayley Scales of Infant Development; IQ, intelligence quotient; MMA, methylmalonic acid; tHcy, total homocysteine.

Adv Nutr 2016;7:879–88; doi:10.3945/an.115.012021.879 Vitamin B-12 and brain development.Central nervous system and brain development begins during week 3 of ges-tation and continues throughout infancy and early childhood(20, 21).During neurulation and cellular proliferation (22), cells begin to migrate and form the neural tube along the no- tochord, facilitating neuronal differentiation (20).Myelina-tion and synaptogenesis begin in trimester 3 and continueto inﬂuence neuronal development in offspring during the ﬁrst few years of life (22).The rate of brain development varies in the different regions of the brain and is in ﬂuenced by various environmental and genetic factors.Inadequatenutrient availability in utero can affect brain development adversely during gestation and in postnatal stages (23).
Vi- tamin B-12 is required for de novo DNA synthesis andmethylation, which is critical for rapid cell division andgrowth, including in the developing fetus and brain (24).V i t a m i nB - 1 2p l a y sa ni m p o r t a n tr o l ei nn e u r a lm y e l i n a -tion, synaptogenesis, myelination, and neurotransmittersynthesis, with potential effects on cognitive developmentand ultimate cognitive functioning (2, 22, 24 –26). Inade- quate vitamin B-12 status can impair these processes and lead to neural damage and brain atrophy (27, 28).VitaminB-12 insufficiency in utero has been associated with im-paired growth, psychomotor function, and brain develop-ment in epidemiologic studies, early deficits of whichmay be irreversible (24, 29).Cognitive domains.Cognition refers to the mental pro- cesses involved in memory, attention, learning, and execu- tive functions, and cognitive development describes thematuration of these processes early in life (30).
The maincognitive domains included in this review are indexes ofmemory, attention, and perception; global measures of cog-nitive development were also considered, including develop-mental outcomes, academic performance, and intelligencequotient (IQ). Cognitive assessment instruments include the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), Raven ’s Colored Progressive Matrices, Wechsler Intelligence Scalefor Children, Wide Range Assessment for Memory andLearning, Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities,and Wide Range Achievement Test.The major cognitive do-mains and common cognitive assessment instruments arepresented in Table 1 .Nutrient–nutrient interactions: other B vitamins involved in cognition.Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency may co-occur with other nutrient de ﬁciencies, including other B vitamins in- volved in one-carbon metabolism (7).
Micronutrients suchas folate, ribo ﬂavin, and choline interact in one-carbon me- tabolism (31), and may in ﬂuence vitamin B-12 biomarkers and cognitive function (32). For example, ribo ﬂavin and vita- min B-6 are important cofactors in folate metabolism (33).Riboﬂavin is an essential cofactor for methyltetrahydrofolate reductase, and ribo ﬂavin de ﬁciency can impair conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate,reducing tetrahydrofolate availability and subsequentnucleotide synthesis, homocysteine remethylation, andS-adenosylmethionine production for methylation reactions (34).Similarly, pyridoxal phosphate is required for the con-version of tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolateand subsequent neurotransmitter synthesis (34).Cholineis a precursor of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, andit plays an important role in methylation reactions, mye- lination (35), and neurotransmitter synthesis (36).
To date, most studies examining the effects of B vitaminson cognition have focused on multiple micronutrientsupplementation and cognitive function or decline in adults.The specific effects of vitamin B-12 on cognitive develop-ment or potential mechanisms involved have not beenelucidated. Role of vitamin B-12 in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions.Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency has been implicated in an increased occurrence and severity of neurodevelopmental disorders (37) and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia (38), autism (39), depression (40, 41),and epileptic conditions (42), based on neuroimaging andclinical and epidemiologic studies.Several systematic reviewshave been conducted to examine the role of vitamin B-12 andother B vitamins in cognitive decline, dementia, and neuro-psychiatric conditions.However, to our knowledge, there islimited evidence concerning the role of vitamin B-12 in cog- nitive development in healthy children.
Vitamin B-12 and cognition in children. The objective of this review was to examine the evidence that links maternal or child vitamin B-12 status and cognitive development inchildren.We examined the evidence from observationalstudies and intervention trials on the role of vitamin B-12in cognitive development.
We then discussed research gapsand implications for the development of interventions toimprove cognition in children.TABLE 1 Cognitive assessment instruments and respective domains Cognitive assessment instrument Cognitive domains assessed Bayley Scales of Infant DevelopmentMental and psychomotor development Raven ’s Colored Progressive MatricesIntelligence, reasoning, problem- solving, learning, and abstractthinking Wide Range Assessment Tests for Memory and Learning; WideRange Assessment of Visual Motor Ability; Wide Range Assessment of OverallAchievementVisual –spatial memory and skills, visual –motor skills, motor skills, reading abilities, and mathematical skills Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children; Wechsler Intelligence Scale for AdultsIntelligence quotient, attention span, coordination, concentra- tion, short-term memory,perception, and execution Digit span test Short-term memory, attention, and speed Intelligence quotient Evaluation of information, concep- tion, and observational skills Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test Verbal and nonverbal intelligence 880 Venkatramanan et al.
Methods We conducted a structured literature search with the use of the MEDLINE and PsycINFO electronic databases. Relevant MeSH and exact terms were used to identify published studies in MEDLINE and PsycINFO, respectively,through 6 September 2015.The search terms used are provided in Table 2 , and the search strategy is summarized in Figure 1 .Initial inclusion criteria for this review were the availability of an ab- stract and inclusion of data on maternal or child vitamin B-12 status (orintake) and child cognitive outcomes.The following vitamin B-12 bio-markers were included in this review: serum and plasma total vitamin B-12, MMA, tHcy, and holotranscobalamin.The cognitive domains included were memory, attention, and perception.Data on other aspects of cognitivefunctioning, including psychomotor and mental development, academic per- formance, and IQ also were extracted and summarized in this review.
Abstracts of all studies were searched, full-text articles were extracted and reviewed, and the following inclusion criteria were applied: 1) human studies, 2) availability of data on maternal or child vitamin B-12 status, di- etary intake, or supplementation, and child cognitive outcomes, and 3) studies focusing on children and adolescents (<18 y). All observationalcross-sectional, case –control, and cohort studies, as well as randomized trials, interventions, and quasi-randomized and uncontrolled trials thatmet participant and methodologic selection criteria were included.Sources were retrieved, collected, indexed, and assessed for vitamin B-12 exposure and child cognitive outcome data.Additional sources were identified from bibliographies of published studies, manual searches of related articlesof interest in references, and scientific meeting abstracts.An additionalsearch was used to find review articles, which were examined to crossrefer- ence other relevant studies.
Abstracts and full-text articles were reviewed in- dependently by 2 reviewers (SV and IEA) and evaluated for inclusion; datawere extracted in duplicate, risk of bias was evaluated, and any discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer (JLF). A standardized data extraction table was used to organize key information from studies that met the inclusioncriteria.As part of this protocol, publication date, authors, study location,setting, target population, definitions of exposures and outcomes, main findings, and study limitations were recorded.Results Literature review The structured literature search in PubMed resulted in 337articles, which were reviewed for potential inclusion.
After257 studies were excluded ( n= 77 review articles, n=5 3 case reports, n= 43 metabolic disease studies, n= 33 studies in other languages, n= 25 articles missing data on vitamin B-12, n= 15 articles focusing on dietary assessment, n=8 articles with no data on the association between vitaminB-12 and cognition, and n= 3 articles on eating disorders), 80 full-text articles were extracted for further review. Afterwe excluded 64 studies that did not meet inclusion criteria(n= 11 animal studies, n= 12 multiple micronutrient stud- ies,n= 12 studies in adult populations, n= 15 studies with no data on cognitive outcomes, n= 13 studies on neuropsy- chiatric conditions, and n= 1 methods paper), 16 studies were identified for inclusion in this review.The structuredliterature search in the PsycINFO database with the equiva-lent exact terms resulted in one additional cross-sectionalstudy.
A total of 17 studies were included in this review: 16 ob-servational studies (3 cross-sectional, including 2 from Pub-Med and 1 from PsycINFO; 1 case-control; and 12 cohort) and 1 randomized trial. The structured literature search is presented in Figure 1 .A summary of the main findings by ma- ternal and child vitamin B-12 status is presented in Table 3 ,a n d findings from these studies are summarized in detail by studydesign in Supplemental Tables 1 –4.Maternal vitamin B-12 status and child cognitive outcomes Vitamin B-12 biomarkers.Several studies have examined the associations between maternal or child vitamin B-12 sta-tus and cognitive outcomes in children, and have reportedcontradictory ﬁndings.Higher maternal vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy has been associated with improved mea-sures of cognition in children later in life.
A prospectiveanalysis was conducted within the Pune Maternal NutritionStudy in India to examine the associations between mothers ’ plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations at 28 wk of gestation (plasma vitamin B-12 <77.0 pM compared with >224.0pM) and cognitive outcomes in their children at 9 y of age(43).

Therewere no differences between children in the lower vitaminB-12 and higher vitamin B-12 groups on scores on intelli-gence tests or visual agnosia in multivariate analyses adjustingfor familial socioeconomic status and child sex, age, and an-thropometric measures. The authors also reported associa-tions between maternal plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations during pregnancy and attention in their children at 9 y of age (43).Lower maternal plasma vitamin B-12 concen-trations during pregnancy were associated with a signifi-cantly lower attention span in children at 9 y of agethan were higher maternal plasma vitamin B-12 concen-trations (plasma vitamin B-12 <77.0 compared with>224.0 pM; mean 6SD: 159.0 641.2 compared with 182.0655.2 s; P< 0.05) in multivariate analyses adjusting for familial socioeconomic status and child sex, age, length,and weight (43).
Another prospective cohort study from In- dia studied the associations between mothers ’plasma vita- min B-12 concentrations during pregnancy and cognitiveoutcomes in their children at 10 y of age (44). Childrenborn to women with adequate or deficient plasma vitaminB-12 concentrations during pregnancy (plasma vitaminB-12$150 compared with <150 pmol/L) had similar atten- tion scores, as measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scalefor Children-III (mean 6SD: 32.3 68.0 compared with 33.268.2;P> 0.05) (44).No significant associations were observed between maternal plasma vitamin B-12 concentra-tions and child cognitive outcomes.However, lower mater-nal plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations during pregnancy(plasma vitamin B-12 <150 pmol/L) were associated withimproved verbal fluency scores in children compared with FIGURE 1 A diagrammatic representation of the search strategy used to identify and select studies for inclusion in the review.882 Venkatramanan et al.

This study did not report any significant associations between maternal vitamin B-12 sta- tus and other cognitive test components (44).In another co-hort study in India, higher maternal plasma vitamin B-12concentrations (plasma vitamin B-12 $150 pmol/L) during pregnancy (28 wk gestation) were associated with signifi-cantly higher mental development quotients (101 comparedwith 98; P= 0.035) and social development quotients (93 compared with 91; P= 0.029) in children at 2 y of age than those in children born to mothers with lower plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations (plasma vitamin B-12 <150pmol/L) (45).
In contrast, in a cohort study in Canada,mothers ’plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations during preg- nancy (16 –36 wk gestation) were not significantly associated with neurocognitive outcomes in their children at 18 mo ofage, as measured by the BSID-III (46). Maternal vitamin B-12 dietary intake.Several observational studies have been conducted to examine the associations be-tween mothers ’dietary vitamin B-12 intake and cognitive outcomes in their children later in life.A prospective cohortstudy was conducted in England to evaluate the associationsbetween mothers ’vitamin B-12 intake during pregnancy(with an FFQ at 32 wk gestation) and IQ in their children at 8 y of age ( n= 6259) (47).Maternal vitamin B-12 intake during pregnancy was associated with a higher IQ in children(2.0 IQ points; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.8 IQ points; P<0 .0 0 1 )i nm u l - tivariate analyses that adjusted for maternal daily energy in- take, child age, and child sex (47).
However, findings wereno longer statistically significant in multivariate analyses afteradditionally adjusting for maternal education, age, parity, al-cohol intake, folic acid supplementation, and infection (0.7IQ points; 95% CI: 20.04, 1.4 IQ points; P= 0.06), or after additionally adjusting for length of gestation, duration ofbreastfeeding, and infant birth weight (0.5 IQ points; 95% CI:20.2, 1.2 IQ points; P= 0.15). In a prospective analysis within Project Viva in Massa- chusetts, investigators examined the associations betweenmaternal dietary intake (with an FFQ) of B vitamins duringtheﬁrst and second trimesters of pregnancy and cognitive outcomes in children at 3 y of age, including overall intelli-gence, visual motor and spatial skills, and ﬁne motor skills (48).
Higher maternal dietary vitamin B-12 intake during the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with lower child vocabulary scores as measured by the PeabodyPicture Vocabulary Test III, with a 0.4 point decrease forevery 2.6 mg increase in maternal vitamin B-12/d ( 20.4 points; 95% CI: 20.8,20.01 points; P= 0.01) (48).

In another analysis in the same cohort, cognitive tests were administered to children at 7 y of age ( n=895) (49). Ma- ternal vitamin B-12 dietary intake during pregnancy wasnot significantly associated with child IQ (49).In a prospective cohort study in Mexico, investigators ex- amined the associations between maternal dietary vitaminB-12 intake (with an FFQ) in the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy and child development at 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo of age (50).In-adequate maternal vitamin B-12 intake (<2.0 mg/d) was as- sociated with poorer mental development scores ( b=21.6; 95% CI: 22.8,20.3;P< 0.05) in children at 12 mo of age as measured by the BSID-II (50).Child vitamin B-12 status and cognitive outcomes Vitamin B-12 biomarkers.Several observational studies have been conducted to examine the associations betweenvitamin B-12 status and cognitive outcomes in children.
Across-sectional study was conducted to examine the associ- ations between child plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations and the mental processing index, which included measuresofﬂuid reasoning, short-term memory, retrieval ability, and speed in school-aged children (6 –10 y) in India (51). In this study, higher child plasma total vitamin B-12 concen-trations [median (IQR): 197.0 pmol/L (151, 266 pmol/L)]were associated with poorer number recall and word order,indicators of short-term memory [log (vitamin B-12), b= 20.19; 95% CI: 20.36,20.03; P< 0.05] (51).Higher child plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations were also associatedwith lower mental processing index scores [log (vitaminB-12),b=20.12; 95% CI: 20.22,20.02; P= 0.02] in mul- tivariate analyses after adjusting for child hemoglobin, serumfolate concentrations, and WHO height-for-age zscores (51).
A nested case –control study was conducted in the Neth- erlands to examine measures of cognitive function in adoles- cents who had consumed a macrobiotic (vegan) diet ( n= 93; 10–16 y) from birth until 6 y of age compared with adoles- cents who had consumed an omnivorous diet (control; n= 102; 10 –18 y) during the same time period (52). This study compared measures of intelligence in adolescents who hadconsumed vegan or omnivorous diets earlier in life; individ-uals who consumed the macrobiotic diet had significantlylower fluid intelligence scores than did adolescents in the omnivorous diet group (52).Vitamin B-12 biomarkers were evaluated in individuals at 16 y of age, including serumtotal vitamin B-12, plasma holotranscobalamin, serumMMA, and plasma tHcy.
In analyses in adolescents (16 y),elevated serum MMA (>0.29 mmol/L), an indicator of im- paired vitamin B-12 status, was associated with poorershort-term memory as measured by the digit span test ( b= 20.24; 95% CI: 20.46,20.02; P< 0.05) (52). Individuals who had consumed a vegan diet were then classified as hav- ing a normal or deficient vitamin B-12 status on the basis ofserum vitamin B-12 and MMA concentrations (normal: se-rum vitamin B-12 $229 pmol/L or MMA #0.29mmol/L compared with deficient: serum vitamin B-12 <229 pmol/Lor MMA >0.29 mmol/L).Adolescents with lower serumvitamin B-12 concentrations had significantly lower fluid in- telligence scores than did individuals with normal serum vi- tamin B-12 concentrations ( r=20.28; 95% CI: 20.48, 20.08; P= 0.003) (52).
In a secondary analysis of data from the NHANES-III in children (6 –16 y), serum vitamin B-12 concentrations were not associated with any of the cognitive outcomes assessed(i.e., reading and math measured by the Wide Range Assess-ment of Overall Achievement –Revised, and block design and digit span measured by Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children –Revised) (53). However, higher child serum vita- min B-12 concentrations were correlated with higher math (r= 0.06; P< 0.05) and digit span ( r= 0.08; P<0 .0 5 )t e s t scores, which reflect attention and short-term memory (53).In a prospective cohort study in India, investigators ex- amined the associations between vitamin B-12 status (i.e.,plasma total vitamin B-12, MMA, and tHcy) and neurocog-nitive development (BSID-II) in children 12 –18 mo of age (54).Higher child plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations were associated with significantly higher BSID-II mental de-velopment scores (1.3; 95% CI: 0.2, 2.4; P= 0.02) (54).
Sim- ilarly, higher plasma MMA (1.1; 95% CI: 0.3, 1.8; P= 0.004) and tHcy (2.0; 95% CI: 0.5, 3.4; P= 0.007) concentrations were associated with lower BSID-II mental developmentscores (54). The effects of vitamin B-12 and/or folic acidsupplementation on early child development were assessed in a recent randomized controlled trial in India (55).In this study, 422 children aged 6 –30 mo were randomly as- signed to 1 of 4 groups stratified by age (<12 comparedwith$12 mo) as follows: 1) vitamin B-12, 2) folic acid, 3) vitamin B-12 and folic acid, or 4) placebo daily for a dura- tion of 6 mo.Children who received both vitamin B-12 andfolic acid had 0.45 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.73; P= 0.0001) and 0.28 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.54; P< 0.05) higher SD units in gross mo- tor and problem-solving functioning domains, respectively than did those in the placebo group (55).
Children in the vi-tamin B-12 group had significantly higher gross motor de-velopmental scale scores at end line than did those in theplacebo group (4 points; 95% CI 0.3, 7.8 points; P< 0.05) as measured by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire 3 (55). A cross-sectional study was conducted in Israel to exam- ine the associations between child serum vitamin B-12 con- centrations (serum vitamin B-12 <200 pg/mL) and academic performance in 67 elementary school children (9 –11 y) (56).Child serum vitamin B-12 concentrations were evaluated, andan FFQ was administered to assess the number of meals con-taining meat consumed per week (as a proxy for vitamin B-12intake); parental employment status, academic achievementindex, and grades in school (numeric grades from 0 –100) were also evaluated (56).
A total of 25% of children had low serum vitamin B-12 concentrations (serum vitamin B-12 <200 pg/mL); a higher frequency of meat consumptionwas associated with improved school performance ( r= 0.3; P= 0.006) (56). Higher serum vitamin B-12 concentrations (serum vitamin B-12 $200 pg/mL; mean 6SE: 0.49 6 0.10; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.70; P= 0.0001) and paternal employ- ment status (mean 6SE: 0.25 60.10; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.46; 884 Venkatramanan et al.P= 0.02) were significantly associated with greater academic achievement (>80%).Similar findings were reported from another cohort study in Colombia; this study was conducted to examine the associations between plasma vitamin B-12concentrations and academic performance in school-agedchildren (5 –12 y; n=3156) (57).
Children who were vitamin B-12 deficient (plasma vitamin B-12 <148 pmol/L) had a sig-nificantly higher risk of school absenteeism (RR: 1.89; 95%CI: 1.53, 2.34; P< 0.0001) and grade repetition (i.e., failing $3 subjects, including mathematics and language; RR: 2.36; 95% CI: 1.03, 5.41; P= 0.04) than did nondeficient children (plasma vitamin B-12 $148 pmol/L) (57). Child vitamin B-12 dietary intake.A randomized con- trolled feeding trial was conducted in Kenya to examine the effects of consuming food-based interventions on vari-ous indexes of cognitive function in school-aged children(median age: 7.4 y), including problem-solving tasks, a ver-bal reasoning test, and a digit span test (58).Children wererandomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: 1) vegetables with maize and beans, 2) milk plus maize and beans, 3) meat (60 g beef) plus vegetables, and 4) a control group with no food supple- ment.
In an ancillary analysis conducted within this trial, higher dietary vitamin B-12 intake in children was associ-ated with improved memory, as measured by the digit spantest (0.24 points; b6SEM: 0.01 60.005 points; P<0 . 0 5 ) (58).In a cohort study in Iran in school-aged children, to-tal dietary vitamin B-12 intake during breakfast meals wasnot significantly associated with short-term memory (r = 1.0;P= 0.50) as measured by number recall on the Wechs- ler Scale (59).In the same study, dietary vitamin B-12 in- take from breakfast meals was associated with improvedschool performance (i.e., average annual grades) ( P= 0.02) (59).However, child vitamin B-12 status was notassessed in this study (59).Discussion Emerging evidence suggests that inadequate supply of vita-min B-12 during pregnancy and early childhood can havelasting effects on infant growth and brain development,which may be irreversible.
However, most studies to datehave been observational in design, and included a singlemeasurement of vitamin B-12 status or intake during preg- nancy (or early childhood) and global measures of cognition in children later in life. These observational studies have sev-eral methodologic limitations, including small sample size,limited assessment of biomarkers of vitamin B-12 status,and nonspeci ﬁc cognitive assessment tools, which constrain interpretation of the ﬁndings.To our knowledge, there is rel- atively limited evidence regarding the role of vitamin B-12 inspeciﬁc child cognitive outcomes, and only one randomized trial has been conducted to date to examine the effects of child vitamin B-12 supplementation on cognitive outcomes.Findings from observational studies that examined the associations between maternal vitamin B-12 status or intakeand child cognitive outcomes were heterogeneous.
Twostudies from India noted that a higher maternal vitaminB-12 status during pregnancy was associated with improved child cognitive outcomes and developmental indexes (43, 45). One study from Mexico reported that inadequate ma- ternal dietary intake of vitamin B-12 during pregnancy wasassociated with poorer developmental outcomes in their in-fants (50).Four observational studies noted no signi ﬁcant as- sociations between maternal vitamin B-12 status and childcognitive outcomes, although speci ﬁc cognitive outcomes as- sessed varied, and the ages of children ranged from 1 to 10 yof age (44, 46, 47, 49).One study noted that higher maternal dietary vitamin B-12 intake during gestation was associated with lower vocabulary skills in children at 3 y of age (48).
Findings from observational studies that evaluated the as- sociations between child vitamin B-12 status or intake andcognitive outcomes were more consistent: higher child vita-min B-12 status was associated with improved cognitive per-formance (52, 58), school performance (56, 57, 59), anddevelopmental indexes (54, 55) in several studies. However, one cross-sectional study suggested that higher child vitamin B-12 status was associated with poorer cognitive measures(51), and a large population-based study did not reportany signi ﬁcant associations between vitamin B-12 status and cognition in children (53).Research gaps: study design Most studies to date on vitamin B-12 and cognition in chil-dren have been observational in design, which constrains the ability to establish temporality and causal inference.
The 3 cross-sectional studies in this review had con ﬂicting ﬁnd- ings: one study noted associations between vitamin B-12 in-take from meat and improved school performance (gradepoint average) (56), whereas another study noted an inverseassociation between child vitamin B-12 status and memory(51), and a third study found no signi ﬁcant associations be- tween child serum vitamin B-12 concentrations and cognitive outcomes (53). Several cohort studies have reported associa- tions between maternal dietary vitamin B-12 intake duringpregnancy and child cognitive outcomes (47, 49, 58, 59).Thesestudies used a variety of dietary assessment methods and cutoff points for vitamin B-12 intake, which limits comparability ofﬁndings between studies.
In other cohort studies (50, 54), plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations were measured in eithert h em o t h e ro rc h i l do n l ya to n et i m ep o i n t .T h et i m ei n t e g r a - tion or the relevant etiologic period of vitamin B-12 in the de- velopment of cognitive outcomes later in childhood isunknown. The randomized controlled trial in India exam-ined the effects of vitamin B-12 and/or folic acid supple-mentation on improved gross motor development andsuggested a bene ﬁcial role for vitamin B-12 on motor and problem-solving skills (55).Vitamin B-12 biomarkers The variety of vitamin B-12 biomarkers assessed in differentstudies (including serum and plasma total vitamin B-12,MMA, tHcy, and holotranscobalamin), laboratory methods,timing of assessment, and cutoffs for vitamin B-12 de ﬁ- ciency and insuf ﬁciency pose challenges when interpreting Vitamin B-12 and child cognition 885 ﬁndings across studies.
In addition to total vitamin B-12, other circulating (e.g., holotranscobalamin) and functional (e.g., MMA) biomarkers are needed to comprehensively as- sess vitamin B-12 status. Further research is needed to eval-uate appropriate vitamin B-12 biomarkers prospectivelyduring pregnancy and early childhood.Role of additional nutrients One-carbon metabolism is in ﬂuenced by a variety of nutri- ents that interact and can compensate for one another whenthere is a de ﬁciency of a single nutrient.The potential role of other micronutrients in one-carbon metabolism, such as fo- late, ribo ﬂavin, pyridoxine, and choline, need to be exam- ined, as they may in ﬂuence both vitamin B-12 metabolism and cognitive development (60).
Additional factors, includ-ing maternal nutritional status, educational levels, andinfant and young child feeding practices, also need to beconsidered in prospective analyses, because they may be as-sociated with both vitamin B-12 status and cognitive devel- opment in offspring (61). In addition to inclusion of these variables as covariates in analyses, the interactions betweenthese nutrients in the etiology of cognitive outcomes needto be elucidated.Cognitive outcomes The range of cognitive domains and instruments used in dif-ferent studies constrains comparability of ﬁndings.Although many of these instruments are standardized, many have not been validated in different age groups, populations, or othercultural contexts with high sensitivity and speci ﬁcity (62).For example, the BSID, as a screening tool, is one of themost widely used neurocognitive assessment instruments, isadministered to children from birth to 2.5 y of age, and fo-cuses on psychomotor and mental development.
However,for children at older ages, a wide range of cognitive assess- ment instruments have been developed that examine different cognitive functions, as well as tests that assess global intelli-gence and various perceptual abilities (63). Since different as-pects of cognitive functioning (e.g., explicit memory, sustainedattention, selective attention, inhibitory control, and learning)depend on distinct neural systems, they can be affected dif-ferentially by a nutritional alteration.For this reason, it issuggested that future studies select tasks that examine bio- logically distinct aspects of cognitive functioning, in addi- tion to including indexes of global cognitive development(64–66).In addition, when examining the effects of a nu- tritional alteration on cognitive function in children, it isoptimal to assess each aspect of cognitive functioning atvarious time points in order to determine if the develop-ment of each of these processes is delayed or permanentlyaltered (66).
It is also necessary to examine the role of po- tential confounders in the assessment of cognitive develop- ment, such as factors in the home environment in whichthe child was reared, by using the Home Observation forMeasurement of the Environment scores (67). Cognitiveassessment tools that examine specific aspects of brain func-tion (including neuroimaging techniques) and are sensitive tonutritional interventions also are needed urgently, particu- larly for young children.Translational research Findings to date have identi ﬁed a potential role for vita- min B-12 status in child cognitive functioning and per-haps ultimate cognitive potential.However, there is limitedprospective data, and the causal and biological mecha-nisms are unknown.To our knowledge, only one ran-domized controlled trial ha s been conducted to date to determine the effects of vitamin B-12 and/or folic acidon early child development indexes.
Studies in animal and cellular models provide valuable insight into causal mechanisms and pathways of vitamin B-12 in the etiologyof adverse cognitive outcomes. However, there is limitedprospective and causal data in human populations.Thebiological mechanisms of vitamin B-12 in cognitionneed to be elucidated experimentally in relevant animalmodels to inform translational research in at-risk humanpopulations.Conclusions Vitamin B-12 de ﬁciency is a major public health problem, and is associated with an increased risk of adverse childhealth outcomes.Observational studies to date have demon- strated associations between vitamin B-12 status or dietary intake and cognitive outcomes in children.The importanceof adequate vitamin B-12 status, particularly during preg-nancy and early childhood, cannot be overemphasized inlight of the role of vitamin B-12 in neural myelination, braindevelopment, and fetal and child growth.
Further research isurgently needed to elucidate the role of vitamin B-12 in cog-nitive development in order to inform public health ap- proaches in at-risk populations.
