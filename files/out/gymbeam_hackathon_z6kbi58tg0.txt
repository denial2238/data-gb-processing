The Role of YggS in Vitamin B6Homeostasis in Salmonella enterica Is Informed by Heterologous Expression of Yeast SNZ3 Huong N.Vu,aTomokazu Ito,a* Diana M.Downsa aDepartment of Microbiology, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA ABSTRACT YggS (COG0325) is a pyridoxal 5 =-phosphate (PLP)-binding protein pro- posed to be involved in homeostasis of B6vitamers.In Salmonella enterica , lack of yggS resulted in phenotypes that were distinct and others that were similar to those of a yggS mutant of Escherichia coli .Like other organisms, yggS mutants of S.en- terica accumulate endogenous pyridoxine 5 =-phosphate (PNP).Data herein show that strains lacking YggS accumulated /H1101110-fold more PLP in growth medium than a parental strain.The deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate-dependent biosynthetic pathway forPLP and the PNP/pyridoxamine 5 =-phosphate (PMP) oxidase credited with intercon- verting B 6vitamers were replaced with a single PLP synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
The impact of a yggS deletion on the intracellular and extracellular levels of B6vitamers in this restructured strain supported a role for PdxH in PLP homeosta- sis and led to a general model for YggS function in PLP-PMP cycling. Our ﬁndingsuncovered broader consequences of a yggS mutation than previously reported and suggest that the accumulation of PNP is not a direct effect of lacking YggS butrather a downstream consequence.IMPORTANCE Pyridoxal 5 =-phosphate (PLP) is an essential cofactor for enzymes in all domains of life.Perturbations in PLP or B6vitamer content can be detrimental, notably causing B6-dependent epilepsy in humans.YggS homologs are broadly con- served and have been implicated in altered levels of B6vitamers in multiple organ- isms.The biochemical activity of YggS, expected to be conserved across domains, isnot yet known.
Herein, a simpliﬁed heterologous pathway minimized metabolic vari-ables and allowed the dissection of this system to generate new metabolic knowl-edge that will be relevant to understanding YggS. KEYWORDS pyridoxal 5 =-phosphate, vitamin B6, homeostasis, YggS, PdxH, SNZ3 InSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 (referred to hereafter as S.enterica ), YggS is a member of the pyridoxal 5 =-phosphate (PLP)-binding protein family (COG0325), which is highly conserved and distributed in all domains of life.Membersof this family bind PLP, and residues crucial for this binding are required for in vivo function as deﬁned by phenotypic manifestation ( 1–4).Correlations between the status ofyggS and the pool sizes of various B6vitamers led to several reports suggesting a role for this protein in maintaining the homeostasis of PLP ( 4–8).Other than a presumed role for the bound PLP, no biochemical activity for YggS has been described.
YggS from Escherichia coli covalently binds PLP via a Schiff base linkage with residue Lys36, and loss of PLP binding leads to pleiotropic phenotypes in E. coli , which include an imbalance in intracellular levels of amino acids, /H9251-keto acids, and coenzyme A ( 1,5, 7–9), along with sensitivity to pyridoxine (PN) ( 5,7).YggS proteins from multiple organisms complement the sensitivity of an E.coli yggS mutant to PN ( 5,6), consistent with the expectation that members of this conserved protein family have the sameCitation Vu HN, Ito T, Downs DM.2020.The role of YggS in vitamin B6homeostasis in Salmonella enterica is informed by heterologous expression of yeast SNZ3 .J Bacteriol 202:e00383-20.https://doi.org/10 .1128/JB.00383-20 .Editor William W.Metcalf, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.All Rights Reserved .Address correspondence to Diana M.Downs, dmdowns@uga.edu.

Received 1 July 2020 Accepted 28 August 2020 Accepted manuscript posted online 8 September 2020PublishedRESEARCH ARTICLE crossm November 2020 Volume 202 Issue 22 e00383-20 jb.asm.org 1 Journal of Bacteriology22 October 2020 molecular function.Some phenotypes in E.coli were strain and condition dependent, which complicates efforts to deﬁne the precise role of YggS in vivo .A homolog of yggS , designated pipY, was identiﬁed and studied in the context of nitrogen regulation in Synechococcus elongatus (2,10).Compared to wild type, the pipY mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to PN, 3-chloro- D-alanine, and D-cycloserine, the last two of which are antibiotics that target some PLP-dependent enzymes ( 10).
In humans, various mutations in the PLPBP gene (formerly known as PROSC ), a homolog of yggS , are biomarkers for vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy. Analyses performed on cerebrospinal ﬂuid and plasma of these patients showed perturbations in amino acid and vitamin B6 proﬁles ( 3,4,6,11), mirroring the global effects reported in an E.coli yggS mutant.Recently, these results were extended to an HEK293 cell line and zebraﬁsh larvaelacking functional PLPBP ( 4).PLP is an essential cofactor in numerous enzymes, including racemases, decarboxy- lases, and transaminases, across all domains of life ( 12).All free-living organisms possess PLP-dependent enzymes, which account for /H110114% of all activities classiﬁed by the Enzyme Commission (EC) ( 13), making this cofactor essential for cellular function.Organisms must synthesize PLP or obtain it by salvaging other B6vitamers from the environment.PLP can be synthesized de novo via the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP)-dependent pathway ( Fig.
1A ), which is found primarily in gammaproteobacteria, including S. enterica and E.coli , or the DXP-independent pathway, which is found in other bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes ( Fig.1B )(14,15).PLP can also be generated by acquiring pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxine (PN), or pyridoxamine (PM) from the environmentusing enzymes of the PLP salvage pathway ( Fig.1C ).Components of the salvage pathway are at least partially conserved in organisms that do not synthesize PLP de novo , including humans and most animals ( 14,15).PLP has a reactive aldehyde moiety, which has been proposed to generate cellular stress by forming covalent adducts withPLP-independent enzymes that then impact their activity ( 16–18 ).The requirement for PLP, coupled with its reactivity, suggests that the cellular pools of this molecule wouldbe tightly regulated.
Phenotypic analyses have been the starting point for functional elucidation of gene products for decades and remain one of the most powerful approaches available tounderstand complex systems. This study was initiated to use the properties of yggS mutants in S.enterica under different metabolic conﬁgurations to gain insights into the function of the conserved YggS protein family.The data show that while PLP levels aremaintained inside a yggS mutant, signiﬁcant accumulation is found in the growth medium.Metabolic complexity was minimized by expressing the PLP synthase SNZ3pfrom Saccharomyces cerevisiae in an S.enterica strain lacking the DXP-dependent pathway for PLP synthesis and the pyridoxine 5 =-phosphate (PNP)/pyridoxamine 5 =- phosphate (PMP) oxidase (PdxH; EC 1.4.3.5).Metabolic analyses of this strain supporteda role for PdxH in PLP homeostasis and led to a general model placing the role of YggSin the cycling of PLP ¡PMP¡PLP.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Phenotypic consequences of lacking yggS inS. enterica .An in-frame deletion of yggS was constructed in S.enterica and subjected to a range of simple growth analyses.When growth was assessed on minimal no-carbon E (NCE) medium with sole carbonsources that included glucose, gluconate, sorbitol, trehalose, galactose, mannose,fructose, xylose, ribose, arabinose, succinate, rhamnose, glycerol, citrate, malate, pyru-vate, fumarate, and acetate, lack of yggS had no detectable effect (representative growth in Fig.S1A in the supplemental material).These results paralleled thosereported for E.coli on M9 glucose medium ( 1,5) and S.elongatus on BG11 nitrate/ ammonium medium ( 10).A double mutant of S.
enterica with lesions in yggS and glyA (encoding a serine hydroxymethyltransferase [EC 2.1.2.1]) grew in LB (data not shown)and minimal NCE glucose medium if glycine or 0.4% Casamino Acids was added(glycine, T D-glyA[doubling time for glyA mutant] /H110052.3/H110060.1 h and TD-yggSglyA [doubling time for yggS glyA double mutant] /H110052.8/H110060.1 h; Casamino Acids, TD-glyA/H110051.4/H110060.1 hVu et al. Journal of Bacteriology November 2020 Volume 202 Issue 22 e00383-20 jb.asm.org 2 and TD-yggSglyA /H110052.9/H110060.1 h) (Fig.S1B).This result contrasted with an E.coli mutant of the same genotype, which was not viable on LB and had a severe growth defect in M9glucose medium supplemented with glycine or 0.4% Casamino Acids ( 5).Further, growth of a cysK (encoding a cysteine synthase A [EC 2.5.1.47]) mutant of S.enterica and that of a yggS cysK double mutant were indistinguishable on minimal medium (TD-cysK/H110051.7/H110060.1 h; TD-yggScysK/H110051.6/H110060.1 h) (Fig.S1A).In S.
elongatus , lesions in these two loci were synthetically lethal ( 10). Growth of E.coli strains lacking yggS was perturbed by exogenous PN and PL, while an S.enterica yggS mutant was not affected by either (see Fig.S2 in the supplemental material).The phenotype of an E.coli yggS mutant in response to PN was attributed to an impact on valine-sensitive acetohydroxyacid synthases (AHAS) I and III (EC 2.2.1.6) encoded by ilvBN and ilvIH ( 7).S.enterica possesses a valine-insensitive AHAS II encoded by ilvGM in addition to AHAS I.The additional sensitivity of the E.coli yggS mutant to PL could be explained by a recently discovered PL reductase (PdxI [EC 1.1.1.65]), which is capable of converting PL to PN (19).AyggS mutant of E.coli accumulates intracellular PNP, a result that was critical for the conclusion that YggS was involved in PLP homeostasis ( 5,7,8).Wild-type and yggS FIG 1 PLP biosynthesis and salvage.
Organisms can synthesize PLP de novo using either the DXP-dependent pathway (representative pathway in S. enterica and E.coli ) (A) or the DXP-independent pathway (representative pathway in S.cerevisiae and Bacillus subtilis ) (B).Synthesis of PLP via the DXP-independent pathway involves a PLP synthase/glutaminase complex, designated as SNZp/SNOp inyeast and PdxS/PdxT in B.subtilis , respectively.(C) Some organisms have all or part of a salvage pathway (representative pathway in S.enterica and E.coli ) to obtain PLP from the environment.DXP, deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate; AHAP, 3-amino-1-hydroxyacetone 1-phosphate; Gln, glutamine; G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; PL, pyridoxal;PN, pyridoxine; PM, pyridoxamine; PLP, pyridoxal 5 =-phosphate; PNP, pyridoxine 5 =-phosphate; PMP, pyridoxamine 5 =-phosphate.YggS Affects Vitamin B6Homeostasis in S.
enterica Journal of Bacteriology November 2020 Volume 202 Issue 22 e00383-20 jb.asm.org 3 mutant strains of S. enterica were grown to mid-log phase in minimal NCE glucose medium, and the intracellular concentration of B6vitamers was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).E.coli strains were included as con- trols.The data ( Fig.2A ; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material) showed that the S.enterica yggS mutant had an elevated pool of intracellular PNP (146 /H110066 pmol/optical density at 650 nm [OD650]) compared to that of the wild-type strain (9.0 /H110060.7 pmol/ OD650).Importantly, when yggS was expressed in trans in the S.enterica yggS mutant, internal PNP was reduced to a near wild-type level (17.2 /H110060.4 pmol/OD650).Intracel- lular levels of PLP and PMP were not signiﬁcantly altered by the yggS mutation.As expected, an E.coli yggS mutant also accumulated PNP (192 /H110066 pmol/OD650), while none was detectable in the parental strain.
Strains lacking yggS accumulate a B6vitamer(s) in the growth medium. In the course of other experiments, colonies of S.enterica yggS mutants appeared to cross- feed a mutant lacking pdxJ (encoding a PNP synthase [EC 2.6.99.2]) on solid medium.Spent medium of a yggS mutant was tested for the presence of a B6vitamer(s) with a bioassay by exploiting the nutritional requirement of a pdxJ mutant.Spent media from relevant strains grown in minimal glucose medium were ﬁlter sterilized, supplementedwith carbon source and trace elements, and used as growth medium for a pdxJ mutant (see Fig.S3 in the supplemental material).Spent growth medium from yggS mutants, but not the wild-type parental strains, allowed full growth of a pdxJ mutant.When yggS was expressed in trans , the spent medium no longer supported growth.The pdxJ mutant could grow in the spent media from all strains with the addition of 1 /H9262MP L (data not shown).
These data showed that one or more B6vitamer accumulated in the growth medium of strains lacking yggS and described a phenotype of a yggS mutant not previously reported in bacteria. Analysis by HPLC showed that PLP and PMP were present in the spent medium of anS.enterica yggS mutant ( Fig.2B ; see also Table S1).Lack of yggS increased the concentration of PLP in the growth medium by /H1101110-fold over that of the wild type to near micromolar levels (829 /H1100616 nM/OD650and 81/H110062 nM/OD650, respectively).Impor- tantly, the vitamer accumulation was restored to the pattern of a wild-type strain if yggS was provided in trans .Similar to S.enterica , the culture supernatant of an E.coli yggS mutant accumulated /H110117-fold more PLP externally than the wild-type strain (data not FIG 2 Levels of phosphorylated B6vitamers.HPLC analysis of intracellular phosphorylated B6vitamers of E.coli and S.

Other vitamers accumulated to a lesser extent (PMP, 41 /H110061 nM/OD650; PL, 63/H110061 nM/OD650; PN, 36 /H110061 nM/OD650) in the medium of an S.enterica yggS mutant and were undetectable ( /H1102110 nM) in the growth medium of the wild type.Due to their physiological relevance, further characterization focused only on the phosphorylatedvitamers PLP, PNP, and PMP.Effect of yggS mutation is not mediated by DXP-dependent PLP biosynthesis.InS.enterica , dissecting control of vitamin B 6homeostasis, and any role YggS may have in it, is complicated by the presence of PNP as an obligatory intermediate in thesynthesis of PLP via the DXP-dependent pathway ( Fig.1 ).The PLP synthase from S.cerevisiae (SNZ3p) was used to bypass a need for the native DXP-dependent pathway (Fig.1 ).S.
enterica strains expressing SNZ3 intrans synthesize PLP in a single step using endogenous glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), ribose-5-phosphate (R5P), and ammo-nium from the medium ( 20). A heterologous system expressing SNZ3 has the advantage that de novo PLP synthesis is intact, which removes the need to supplement the medium and can eliminate transport and/or salvage of B6vitamers as variables in metabolic studies.SNZ3p was provided in several genetic backgrounds to generate strains that syn- thesized PLP in different ways.The resulting strains were grown in minimal NCEglycerol medium, and endogenous and exogenous levels of PLP, PNP, and PMP werequantiﬁed with HPLC ( Fig.3 ; see also Table S2 in the supplemental material).The data showed that in an otherwise wild-type S.enterica strain, lack of yggS disrupted the pool size of multiple B6vitamers on glycerol, with the dominant effect being increased PLP in the growth medium as it was on glucose ( Fig.3 , row 1).
The remaining strains lacked one or more of the pdxgenes and required SNZ3p to generate PLP. The relevant strains consisted of three isogenic pairs at the yggS locus, and each pair was considered in turn (Fig.3 ).The ﬁrst pair of strains lacked pdxH (encoding PNP/PMP oxidase [EC 1.4.3.5]) and expressed SNZ3 in addition to the native DXP-dependent pathway to PNP ( Fig.1 ).The pdxH mutation led to an endogenous accumulation of PNP as might be expected ( Fig.3, row 2; see also Table S2).Introduction of a yggS mutation ( pdxH yggS pSNZ strain) disrupted all measured B6pools, with the exception of endogenous PLP.This strain, which possessed both the DXP-dependent and -independent pathways, accumulated FIG 3 Status of YggS and PdxH impacts vitamin B6pools.Intracellular and extracellular vitamin B6proﬁles are shown.Each panel (rows 1 to 4) shows a pair of strains differing only at the yggS locus.
Strains of the indicated genotype carry a pBAD33-SD1 empty vector control (pVOC) or one expressing S. cerevisiae SNZ3 (pSNZ).Strains were grown in minimal NCE glycerol supplemented with 0.02% arabinose.HPLC data were obtained from three biological replicates and normalizedto a ﬁnal cell optical density at 650 nm.Error bars depict standard deviation from the mean.In each panel, an asteriskdenotes a Pvalue of /H110210.02 and a double asterisk denotes a Pvalue of /H110210.002 (determined by two-tailed unpaired Student’s ttest), when the yggS /H11001strain and its isogenic yggS derivative are compared.Signiﬁcance as indicated was obtained in at least two independent experiments.YggS Affects Vitamin B6Homeostasis in S.enterica Journal of Bacteriology November 2020 Volume 202 Issue 22 e00383-20 jb.asm.org 5 /H110114-fold more PNP than the isogenic pdxH pSNZ strain.
These data suggested that lack of YggS resulted in increased ﬂux through the DXP-dependent pathway, which was theonly deﬁned way to generate PNP in this strain. Interpretation of these results wascomplicated by input from two pathways, but nonetheless, these data hinted at a linkbetween PdxH and YggS that was supported below.PdxH and YggS modulate PLP/PMP homeostasis.Unlike PNP, both PMP and PLP are physiologically relevant and involved in key enzymatic reactions.To focus on these vitamers, two pairs of strains that lacked the DXP-dependent pathway, and thus theability to generate PNP ( Fig.1 ), were considered.When SNZ3p was the sole source of PLP (i.e., in a pdxJ mutant), the status of both PdxH and YggS impacted the pool sizes of PLP and PMP ( Fig.3 , rows 3 and 4).Considering the pdxJ pSNZ and pdxJH pSNZ mutant strains, lack of pdxH increased the internal and external PMP concentration by /H110112- and 4-fold, respectively, while decreasing external PLP by approximately one-half.
These results were consistent with a general role for PdxH in converting PMP to PLP( Fig. 1 ), utilizing a catalytic activity it is known to have ( 21).The data in Fig.3 (row 3) showed that a lack of YggS in a pdxJ background did little to pool sizes, causing only a small but signiﬁcant decrease in internal PMP levels.In contrast, in strains lacking pdxJ and pdxH (Fig.3 , row 4), a yggS mutation increased external PLP concentration by /H110113-fold and decreased the amount of internal and external PMP by /H110112-fold.Notably, regardless of the source of PLP biosynthesis or background mutations, endogenous PLPlevel remained similar to the levels in wild-type S.enterica .These data suggest a mechanism to maintain internal PLP levels, perhaps by regulating the release of excessPLP to the medium.Such a mechanism appears to be independent of YggS and PdxH.Considering the data in Fig.3 from different perspectives, a general trend emerged.
The status of YggS and the status of PdxH had opposing effects on the ratio of PLP toPMP. Speciﬁcally, lack of PdxH increased accumulated PMP and slightly decreasedexogenous PLP levels, while additional loss of YggS minimized the extent of thesechanges.In contrast, lack of YggS decreased PMP and increased exogenous PLP levelsin the absence of PdxH, suggesting an epistatic interaction between these geneproducts.In total, the data suggested a model in which both PdxH and YggS areinvolved in modulating PLP/PMP homeostasis ( Fig.4 ).It is formally possible that SNZ3p levels are different among the strains, and this impacts B6vitamer pools.We consider FIG 4 Working model for YggS placement in vitamin B6homeostasis.(A) Newly synthesized PLP is incorpo- rated into PLP-dependent enzymes via an unknown mechanism.
(B) During transamination catalyzed byaminotransferases, enzyme-bound PLP is converted to PMP in the ﬁrst half-reaction PMP can be retained inthe active site to regenerate PLP in the second half-reaction (C) or released from the active site (D) andconverted back to PLP by PdxH (E). The status of YggS and PdxH affects PLP-PMP recycling.YggS function isproposed to have a negative impact on the recycling of PMP to PLP.Thus, loss of YggS would lead toincreased total PLP and decreased total PMP pools.Intracellular PLP is maintained via loss of excess PLP to theenvironment.This model does not consider internal accumulation of PNP, which has been examined in otherstudies ( 5,7,8).PLP, pyridoxal 5 =-phosphate; PMP, pyridoxamine 5 =-phosphate; PNP, pyridoxine 5 =-phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate.Vu et al.

Working model for PdxH and YggS in PLP-PMP recycling.Data obtained with the heterologous strains that lacked the ability to synthesize PNP led to a working model for the interconversion of PLP/PMP that implicates both YggS and PdxH.The modelrecognizes that the primary destination of PLP is the active site of PLP-dependentenzymes ( Fig.4A ), which include at least 14 aminotransferases encoded in the S.enterica genome.Importantly, the catalytic cycle of this latter class of enzymes involves the generation of PMP followed by the regeneration of PLP.Initially, an /H9251-amino acid substrate donates an amino group to enzyme-bound PLP to generate the correspond-ing /H9251-keto acid and PMP ( Fig.4B ).
The PMP, if retained in the active site of the enzyme, can then donate an amino group to an /H9251-keto acid, leading to regeneration of PLP and a restored balance of keto and amino acids ( Fig. 4C ).Unlike PLP, the PMP molecule is not covalently bound to the enzyme; in vitro data showed that PMP binds /H11011100-fold less tightly than PLP to apoaminotransferases, and 70% of intracellular PMP is free ( 8, 22).Our model invokes an equilibrium between two pools of PMP, one enzyme bound and one free ( Fig.4D ).The latter pool of PMP is oxidized by PdxH to PLP ( Fig.4E ), and the PLP is reloaded into an apoenzyme ( Fig.4A ) or released from the cell.In this scenario, blocking PdxH would result in the accumulation of PMP and decrease of PLP,consistent with the data herein ( Fig.3 , rows 3 and 4, “ yggS/H11001”).
We suggest that YggS has a negative effect on some, if not all, reactions that convert keto acids to aminoacids, many of which are critical for metabolic homeostasis and involve /H9251-ketoglutarate (Fig. 4C ).In this scenario, the absence of YggS would result in an increased regeneration of PLP-holoenzyme and potentially lead to an overﬂow of newly synthesized PLP, whichis released into the medium ( Fig.2B ).ApdxH mutation would have little impact in the absence of YggS ( Fig.3 , rows 3 and 4, “ yggS/H11002”) since the pool of free PMP would be reduced by elevated levels of transamination acting on the PMP-bound enzyme beforethe vitamer was lost from the active site.It is formally possible that YggS stimulatestransamination reactions that convert PLP to PMP, though it is more difﬁcult to envisiona general mechanism for this effect.
This model does not propose mechanistic detailsfor the metabolic regulation involved, though we favor an indirect effect via alteringmetabolite pools and/or catalyzing an unknown reaction. Conclusions.The data herein showed that in an otherwise wild-type strain, a yggS mutation results in a greater than 10-fold increase in PLP accumulation in growth medium.This result, in combination with the stability of the endogenous PLP pools innumerous strain backgrounds used here, suggests that internal PLP pools are capped,and excess PLP is released to the extracellular milieu.Notably, elevated levels of PLPwere reported in the plasma of patients carrying variants of the human YggS homolog,PLPHP ( 11).Cellular excretion has been described for other key metabolites, such as acetate, amino acids, and heme (reviewed in references 23to25), and may be part of a strategy to maintain stable levels of metabolites that can interfere with metabolichomeostasis.
The use of a heterologous strain background with a single PLP synthase enzyme as the only source of generating PLP ( 20) provided a novel means to probe the role of PdxH and YggS in the homeostasis of PLP and PMP. Importantly, this strain had nodeﬁned mechanism to generate PNP, a vitamer that is nonphysiological, but nonethe-less has ﬁgured prominently in multiple studies on the role of YggS ( 5,7,8,10).In total, the data showed that the statuses of PdxH and YggS impact the levels of PMP andexogenous PLP, which led to a working model to explain these effects.Future studies,both genetic and biochemical, can build on these ﬁndings to ultimately identify thebiochemical function of the YggS protein family.MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains, media, and chemicals.Plasmids and strains used in this study are listed in Table S3 in the supplemental material.Strains are derivatives of S.enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 and E.coli strain BW25113 as indicated.Bacterial strains were incubated at 37°C.
S. enterica was cultured in Difco nutrient broth (NB; 8 g/liter) with NaCl (5 g/liter).Lysogeny broth (LB) was used as a rich medium for E.coli .YggS Affects Vitamin B6Homeostasis in S.enterica Journal of Bacteriology November 2020 Volume 202 Issue 22 e00383-20 jb.asm.org 7 Minimal medium for S.enterica and E.coli was no-carbon E (NCE) supplemented with 1 mM MgSO4, trace elements ( 26), and one of the following as the sole carbon source: glucose (11 mM), gluconate (11 mM), sorbitol (11 mM), trehalose (5.5 mM), galactose (11 mM), mannose (11 mM), fructose (11 mM), xylose(13.2 mM), ribose (13.2 mM), arabinose (13.2 mM), succinate (20 mM), rhamnose (22 mM), glycerol(22 mM), citrate (22 mM), malate (40 mM), pyruvate (50 mM), fumarate (50 mM), or acetate (50 mM).Medium supplements were vitamin-free Casamino Acids (0.4%), glycine (0.67 mM), and PL (1 /H9262M) when appropriate.For solid medium, agar was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1.5% (wt/vol).
The followingantibiotics were used as needed: kanamycin (Km; 50 /H9262g/ml), ampicillin (Am; 150 /H9262g/ml), and chloram- phenicol (Cm; 20 /H9262g/ml in rich medium and 5 /H9262g/ml in minimal medium). Chemicals were purchased from MilliporeSigma (formerly Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated.Restriction enzymesand Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from New England BioLabs (Ipswich, MA).Plasmid and strain construction.Primers used for plasmid and strain construction are listed in Table S4 in the supplemental material.Plasmid pBAD33-SD1 was generated by inserting the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG) in front of the NheI site on pBAD33 ( 27) and was a gift from Jorge C.Escalante-Semerena (University of Georgia, Athens, GA).Plasmids pDM1601 and pDM1594 were con-structed by cloning yggS from S.enterica and SNZ3 from S.cerevisiae YJF153, respectively, at the SacI and XbaI sites downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter in pBAD33-SD1.
Gene insertions wereconﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing at Eton Bioscience (San Diego, CA). Plasmids were propagated in E.coli DH5 /H9251.In-frame deletions of yggS ,pdxJ , and pdxH were generated by one-step gene inactivation using phage /H9261-Red recombinase ( 28) that has been adapted for S.enterica .The initial mutations were introduced into a wild-type strain (DM15847) via phage P22 HT105/1 int-201 transduction ( 29).Trans- ductants were puriﬁed and made phage free as described ( 30).Insertion-deletion mutations of cysK and glyA were present in the laboratory collection and were transduced into appropriate backgrounds.Antibiotic markers were resolved using pCP20 as needed ( 31).Gene deletions were conﬁrmed by colony PCR.The heterologous S.enterica strains were constructed by inactivating the native pdxJ (DM16710) or pdxH (DM16844) alone or a combination of both (DM16627) and transforming pDM1594 for in trans expression of the yeast SNZ3 .The E.
coli yggS mutant was obtained from the Keio collection ( 32). Plasmids were transformed into S.enterica and E.coli strains via electroporation.Growth analysis.S.enterica strains were grown in 2 ml NB overnight.Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 0.85% NaCl prior to inoculation (2.5%) into minimal NCE medium containing carbonsources and supplements as described.Growth was monitored in a 96-well plate by measuring theoptical density at 650 nm (OD 650) using a BioTek ELx808 plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT).Graphs and doubling time ( TD) were generated from Prism 7.0c (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).Inhibitory effect of B6vitamers.Wild-type and yggS strains of S.enterica and E.coli were cultured in rich medium overnight.An aliquot of 100 /H9262l of washed cells was inoculated into molten agar (0.7%) and overlaid onto minimal NCE glucose containing 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (0.5 mM).
Fivemicroliters of 1 mM PL, PN, and PM was spotted on solidiﬁed top agar. After overnight incubation, plateswere photographed by a 13 MP rear camera on a Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime (San Jose, CA).Vitamin B 6bioassay.Overnight cultures of S.enterica and E.coli in rich medium were washed with 0.85% NaCl, and 200 /H9262l was subcultured into 5 ml minimal NCE medium containing glucose as a sole carbon source.After reaching mid-log phase (OD650/H110050.7 to 0.8) as determined by a Spectronic 20D /H11001 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA), cells were pelleted (7,000 /H11003g, 10 min, 4°C), and spent medium was ﬁlter sterilized.Glucose (11 mM), MgSO4(1 mM), and trace elements were added to the spent medium.Growth analysis of the S.enterica pdxJ strain in spent medium was monitored in a 96-well plate as described above.The formal possibility that vitamer accumulation was due to cell lysiswas eliminated by screening spent medium for released proteins.
Aliquots (5 /H9262l) of cell-free spent medium from relevant strains (DM16018, DM16020, DM16021) were run on 14% SDS-PAGE gel andvisualized by Coomassie blue staining. No protein bands were visible in any of the spent medium.Analysis of B 6vitamers by high-performance liquid chromatography.Minimal NCE medium containing glucose (11 mM) or glycerol (22 mM) as a sole carbon source and 0.02% arabinose was usedto cultivate S.enterica and E.coli strains.Cells were harvested during mid-log phase (OD 650/H110050.7 to 0.8) and subjected to analysis using a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system (Shimadzu Scientiﬁc Instruments,Inc., Columbia, MD).Intracellular content of B 6was adapted from protocol described elsewhere and did not distinguish free and enzyme-bound pools of the vitamers ( 7).
Brieﬂy, cell pellets were treated with 5 volumes (vol/wt) of 0.7 M HClO4containing 5 /H9262M 4-deoxypyridoxine (dPN) as an internal standard (50/H9262l for 10 mg cells), resuspended, and incubated on ice for 15 min with occasional agitation. Then, 2.5 volumes of chilled 0.7 M K2CO3were added, followed by another 15-min ice incubation.The mixture was centrifuged (17,000 /H11003g, 15 min, 4°C), and the supernatant was diluted 3-fold before 25 /H9262l was injected into a 250 by 4.6 mm Cosmosil AR-II octyldecyl silane (ODS) column (5 /H9262m particle size; Nacalai USA, Inc., San Diego, CA).Mobile phase A contained phosphoric acid (33 mM) and 1-octanesulfonic acid (8 mM) atpH 2.2 (adjusted with KOH).Mobile phase B contained 80% (vol/vol) acetonitrile.
Vitamin B 6content was analyzed at 27°C (excitation at 328 nm and emission at 393 nm) using a linear gradient program asfollows: 0% B to 1% B for 5 min; 1% B to 19% B for 5 min; 19% B to 28% B for 10 min; 28% B to 63% Bfor 5 min; 63% B for 5 min; 63% to 0% B for 5 min; and column equilibration with 100% A for 15 min. Totalﬂow rate was 0.8 ml/min, and running time was 50 min.Fluorescence was enhanced usin g 1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing sodium bisulﬁte (1 g/liter) at a ﬂow rate of 0.3 ml/min.Extractionof extracellular B 6vitamers was similar to that of intracellular B6analysis with slight modiﬁcations as follows: 10 /H9262l of HClO4(7 M) containing dPN (15 /H9262M) was added to 90 /H9262l cell-free culture supernatant (obtained as described in the bioassay), 50 /H9262l of chilled K2CO3(0.7 M) was added after a 15-min iceVu et al.
Journal of Bacteriology November 2020 Volume 202 Issue 22 e00383-20 jb.asm.org 8 incubation, and extracted content was used for HPLC analysis. Data were analyzed using Shimadzu LabSolutions 5.42 SP2 software, with a detection range of 10 nM to 10 /H9262M for each vitamer.Concen- trations of intracellular and extracellular B6vitamers were calculated as area under the curve normalized to a ﬁnal OD650at which cells were harvested.Peak identity was assigned based on retention time obtained from vitamin B6standards and by coinjecting each vitamer at 1 /H9262M with the samples.In addition, phosphorylated B6vitamers were conﬁrmed by phosphatase treatment (100 mM sodium citrate at pH 5.0, 1 unit of wheat germ acid phosphatase, and 50 /H9262l of cell extract or culture supernatant in a total volume of 150 /H9262l).Following overnight incubation at 37°C, the reactions were stopped by heat inactivation at 95°C for 5 min, and the content was extracted with HClO4and analyzed as described above.
The disappearance of PLP/PNP/PMP peaks and concomitant appearance of correspondingPL/PN/PM peaks conﬁrmed the identity of the phosphorylated B 6vitamers. Statistical analyses were performed on data obtained with three biological replicates in each of two independent experimentsusing Prism 7.0c (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL Supplemental material is available online only.SUPPLEMENTAL FILE 1 , PDF ﬁle, 2.4 MB.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Jorge C.Escalante-Semerena for access to his laboratory strain collection.We acknowledge Michael D.Paxhia for helpful discussions and for the construction ofthe original pdxH mutant strain in S.enterica in addition to plasmids pDM1594 and pDM1601.This work was supported by an award from the competitive grants program at the NIH (GM095837) to D.M.D.and from the JSPS KAKENHI (16K18686 and 17KK0153) to T.I.REFERENCES 1.Ito T, Iimori J, Takayama S, Moriyama A, Yamauchi A, Hemmi H, Yoshimura T.2013.
