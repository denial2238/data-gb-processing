Introduction: Protein ingestion during recovery from exercise has been reported to augment myofibrillar protein synthesis rates, without increasing muscle connective protein synthesis rates. It has been sug-gested that collagen protein may be effective in stimulating muscle connective protein synthesis.The present study assessed the capacity ofboth whey and collagen protein ingestion to stimulate postexercise myofibrillar and muscle connective protein synthesis rates.Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, parallel design, 45 young male ( n= 30) and female ( n= 15) recreational athletes (age, 25 ± 4 yr; body mass index, 24.1 ± 2.0 kg·m /C02) were selected to receive primed continuous intravenous infusions with L-[ring-13C6]-phenylalanine and L-[3,5-2H2]-tyrosine.
After a single session of resistance type exercise, subjects were rando mly allocated to one of three groups ingesting either 30 g whey protein (WHEY, n= 15), 30 g collagen protein (COLL, n= 15) or a noncaloric placebo (PLA, n= 15). Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected over a subsequent 5-h recovery period to assess both myofib rillar and muscle connective p rotein synthesis rates.Results: Protein ingestion in- creased circulating plasma amino acid concentrations ( P< 0.05).The postprandial rise in plasma leucine and essential amino acid concentrations was greater in WHEY compared with COLL, whereas plasma glycine a nd proline concentrations increased more in COLL compared with WHEY ( P< 0.05).Myofibrillar protein synthesis rates averaged 0.041 ± 0.010, 0.036 ± 0.010, and 0.032 ± 0.007%·h−1in WHEY, COLL and PLA, respectively, with only WHEY resulting in higher rates when compared with PLA ( P< 0.05).
Muscle connective protein synthesis rates averaged 0.072 ± 0.019, 0.068 ± 0.017, and 0.058 ± 0.018%·h−1in WHEY, COLL, and PLA, respectively, with no significant differences between groups ( P=0 . 0 9 ) .Conclusions: Ingestion of whey protein during recovery from exerci se increases myofibrillar protein synthesis rates.Neither collagen nor whey protein ingestion further increased muscle connective protein synthesis rates during the early stages of postexerciserecovery in both male and female recreational athletes.Key Words: WHEY PROTEIN, MYOFIBRILLAR PROTEIN, CONNECTIVE TISSUE, RESISTANCE EXERCISE, BONE MARKERS, BARBELL SQUATS Acute exercise strongly increases muscle protein syn- thesis rates, thereby facilitating the skeletal muscleadaptive response to prolonged exercise training (1,2).
Protein ingestion has been shown to further augment postexercise muscle protein synthesis rates, leading to netmuscle protein accretion during recovery from exercise (3,4).The capacity of protein ingestion to stimulate postexercisemuscle protein synthesis rates has been shown to depend onboth the quality and amount of protein ingested (5 –8). Inges- tion of 20 g of a high-quality protein source, such as egg orwhey protein, have been reported to maximize postexercise muscle protein synthesis rates in healthy adults (6,9).Conse- quently, athletes are typically advised to consume 20 to 25 gof high-quality protein during recovery from an exercise boutto support muscle conditioning and, as such, optimize exercisetraining adaptations.Address for correspondence: L.J.C.van Loon, Ph.D., Department of Human Biology, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Maastricht University, PO Box 616,6200 MD, Maastricht, The Netherlands; E-mai l: l.vanloon@maastr ichtuniversity.nl.T.A.and L.H.

DOI: 10.1249/MSS.0000000000003214 1792BASIC SCIENCES Besides the force-generating contractile apparatus (i.e., myo- fibrillar proteins), skeletal muscle tissue also contains a com-plex network of connective proteins responsible for transferringthese forces along the muscle (10). More specifically, up to 80% of the contractile force is transferred laterally through the intracellular and extracellula r connective protein network be- fore reaching the tendon to facilitate joint movement (11,12).The quality of the muscle connective protein network is a keyfactor determining the capacity for muscle to generate force.Itshould not be surprising that, along with the myofibrillar pro-teins, the muscle connective proteins are also under constant re-modeling.Furthermore, connectiv e protein synthesis rates in- crease in response to both an acute bout of exercise (13 –18), as well as longer-term period of exercise training (19).
It has been well established that protein ingestion during re- covery from exercise increases myofibrillar protein synthesisrates (5,9). However, it remains unclear whether muscle con-nective protein synthesis rates are responsive to protein inges-tion during postexercise recovery.We recently showed thatthe ingestion of up to 40 g casein protein does not further aug- ment postexercise muscle connective protein synthesis rates (16,17).This seems to be in line with some (13,20 –23) but not all (24) studies investigating the effect of protein ingestionon muscle connective protein synthesis rates.All of these stud-ies administered their subjects either dairy protein or a selectset of essential amino acids.It has been suggested that theseprotein sources may not provide sufficient amino acid precur-sors to support a further increase in postexercise muscle con- nective protein synthesis rates (25,26).
With collagen being the major structural protein in connective tissue (11), the mostabundant amino acids found in connective tissue structures areglycine and proline (constituting ~25 and 12%, respectively(27)). It has been argued that, in contrast to dairy protein, in-gestion of dietary collagen may be more effective in stimulat-ing muscle connective protein synthesis rates, due to its highglycine and proline contents (25,28).In fact, Shaw et al.(29) reported that plasma samples obtained after collagen ingestion in vivo in humans, stimulate in vitro collagen synthesis when applied on engineered ligaments.Although it has been shownthat collagen protein ingestion does not stimulate myofibrillarprotein synthesis rates (19,30), no study to date has assessedthe impact of collagen protein ingestion on postexercise myo-fibrillar and muscle connective protein synthesis rates.
We hypothesized that, in contrast to whey protein, collagen protein ingestion increases postexercise muscle connective protein synthesis rates. Furthermore, we hypothesized that,in contrast to collagen protein, whey protein ingestion in-creases postexercise myofibrillar protein synthesis rates.Totest our hypotheses, we selected 45 healthy young men andwomen to ingest 30 g whey protein, 30 g collagen protein,or a noncaloric placebo after a single bout of resistance exercise.Primed, continuous intravenous L-[ring-13C6]-phenylalanine in- fusions were applied with blood and muscle tissue samples col- lected frequently to assess postexercise myofibrillar as well asmuscle connective protein synthesis rates during recovery fromexercise in male and female recreational athletes.METHODS Subjects.
A total of 45 healthy, recreationally active men and women (age, 25 ± 4 yr; body mass index [BMI], 24.1 ± 2.0 kg·m−2) with prior experience with resistance exer- cise training including free weights (>6 months, 3 /C2per week) volunteered to participate in this parallel-group, double-blind,randomized controlled trial. Subjects ’characteristics are pre- sented in Table 1.After pretesting, subjects were randomlyassigned to one of three groups consuming either 30 g wheyprotein (WHEY), 30 g collagen protein (COLL) or a noncalo-ric placebo (PLA).All subjects were informed of the nature and possible risks of the experimental procedures before their written informed consent was obtained.This study was ap-proved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the MaastrichtUniversity Medical Centre+ and conforms to the principlesoutlined in the declaration of Helsinki for use of human sub-jects and tissue.
The trial was registered at the NetherlandsTrial Register (NL8814) and was conducted betweenFebruary 2020 and December 2020 at Maastricht University Medical Centre+, Maastricht, The Netherlands. Clinical Trial Center Maastricht independently monitored the study.Pretesting.Participants (age 18 –35 yr with a BMI > 18.5 and <30.0 kg·m /C02) underwent an initial screening session to assess height, body weight, body composition (BIA, BioScan920, Maltron International Ltd, UK), and the one repetitionmaximum (1RM) of the barbell squat exercise.The 1RMwas estimated using the multiple repetitions testing procedure and calculated using the Brzycki equation (31).Participants were deemed healthy based on their responses to a medicalquestionnaire and were excluded from participation ifsmoking, using medication that affected protein metabolism,having any musculoskeletal diseases, or intolerant to the in-vestigated protein products.
The pretesting and experimentaltrials were separated by at least 5 d. Diet and physical activity.All participants refrained from strenuous physical activity and alcohol consumption and filled out food intake and physical activity questionnairesfor 2 d before the experimental trial.Habitual dietary intake TABLE 1.Subjects ’characteristics and average 2-d dietary intake before the experimental period.

COLLAGEN PROTEIN AND POSTEXERCISE RECOVERY Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise ®1793BASIC SCIENCES data were analyzed using online software available from the Dutch Health Council (Mijn Eetmeter: https://mijn. voedingscentrum.nl/nl/eetmeter/) and are presented in Table 1.Participants consumed the same standardized meal before 21.00 on the evening before the experimental trial.This prepackaged standardized meal provided 1.71 MJ, with 55%of the energy from carbohydrate, 30% energy from fat, and15% energy from protein.Thereafter, participants remainedfasted until the experimental test day.Study design.Participants performed barbell squatting exercise before consuming a randomly assigned beverage(500 mL) containing either 30 g whey protein (WHEY), 30 g collagen protein (COLL) or placebo (PLA).
Nutri® Whey Isolate (FrieslandCampina, The Netherlands) and colla-gen protein hydrolysate (ATRO ProVita GmbH, Germany)were dissolved in water after which beverages were flavoredwith vanilla flavoring (Dr. Oetker, The Netherlands).The non-caloric placebo (PLA) was flavored water.Amino acid pro-files of the protein beverages are shown in Table 2.Neitherthe whey nor the collagen protein supplement contained addi- tional vitamin C.Randomization was performed using a com- puterized list randomizer (http://www.randomization.com/).Participants were sequentially allocated to the treatmentgroups, stratified by sex, by an independent researcher, ac-cording to the randomized list.The study beverages were pre-pared by an independent researcher in nontransparent plasticcontainers and had a similar taste and smell.All women weretested in the same phase of the menstrual cycle (within the first 7 d of the follicular phase).Experimental protocol.
For a schematic representation of the primed continuous infusion protocol, see SupplementalFigure 1 (Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MSS/C864). At ∼07:45 AM, participants arrived at the labora- tory in an overnight fasted state.A catheter was inserted intoan antecubital vein for stable isotope amino acid infusion.Sub- sequently, a second catheter was inserted into a dorsal handvein of the contralateral arm for arterialized venous blood sam-pling.To obtain arterialized blood samples, the hand was placed in a hot box (60°C) for 10 min before blood sample col- lection.After taking a baseline blood sample ( t=−180 min), the plasma phenylalanine pool was primed with a single intra-venous dose (priming dose) of L-[ring-13C6]-phenylalanine (3.15 μmol·kg−1)a n d L-[3,5-2H2]-tyrosine (1.20 μmol·kg−1).
After priming, a continuous intravenous infusion of L-[ring- 13C6]-phenylalanine (0.070 μmol·kg−1·min−1)a n d L-[3,5- 2H2]-tyrosine (0.027 μmol·kg−1·min−1)w a si n i t i a t e da n d maintained using a calibrated IVAC 598 pump. Thereafter, rectus femoris cross-sectional area was determined by ultra- sound (MyLab Gamma, Esaote, Italy).After resting in a su-pine position, a second and third arterialized blood samplewere drawn ( t=−120 min; t=−60 min).After resting for an- other 25 min, participants initiated ( t=−35 min) the resistance exercise intervention (described below).Immediately after theexercise intervention ( t= 0 min), an arterialized blood sample was obtained, and a muscle biopsy sample was collected from thevastus lateralis muscle of a randomly selected leg.Subse- quently, participants received a 500-mL beverage correspond-ing to their randomly assigned treatment allocation (WHEY,n= 15; COLL, n=1 5 ;P L A , n= 15).
Sequential arterialized blood samples were collected at t= 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 min throughout the postprandial period. The sec-ond muscle biopsy sample was collected at t = 300 min to de- termine postprandial myofibrillar and muscle connective pro- tein synthesis rates ( t=0–300 min).When the experimental protocol was complete, the cannulas were removed, and par-ticipants ate and were monitored for ∼30 min before leaving the laboratory.Blood and muscle tissue sampling.Blood samples were collected into EDTA-containing tubes and centrifuged at1000 gfor 15 min at 4°C.Aliquots of plasma were frozen in liq- uid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.Biopsy samples were col- lected using a 5-mm Bergström needle custom-adapted formanual suction.Samples were obtained from separate inci-sions from the middle region of the vastus lateralis ,∼15 cm above the patella and ∼3 cm below entry through the fascia, under 1% xylocaine local anesthesia with adrenaline(1:100,000).
Muscle samples were freed from any visiblenonmuscle material, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until further processing. Resistance exercise session.All participants followed the same exercise protocol that consisted of a 5-min warm-upon a cycle ergometer followed by si x sets of barbell squats.Bar- bell squats were performed with free weights from full knee ex-tension to the point the thighs were parallel to the floor.Theworkload was set at 60% of 1RM with 15, 12, 10, 10, 8, and8 repetitions per set.Resting periods of 2 min were allowed be- tween all sets.Delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) of the legs was self-reported by the subjects 24 and 48 h after cessa-tion of the training session usin g a seven-point Likert scale of muscle soreness with a score of 0 indicating complete absenceTABLE 2.Amino acid profiles of the test beverages.

Plasma glucose and insulin concentra- tions were analyzed using co mmercially available kits (GLUC3, Roche, Ref: 05168791 190, and Immunologic, Roche, Ref: 12017547 122, respectively). Quantification ofplasma amino acid concentrations was performed usingultra-performance liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry(UPLC-MS; ACQUITY UPLC H-Class with QDa; Waters,Saint-Quentin, France).Blood plasma (50 μL) was deproteinized using 100 μL of 10% SSA with 50 μMo f MSK-A2 internal standard (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA).Subsequently, 50 μLo fu l t r a - p u r e demineralized water was added, and samples were centrifuged(15 min at 14,000 RPM).After centrifugation, 10 μLo fs u - pernatant was added to 70 μL of Borate reaction buffer (Wa- ters, Saint-Quentin, France).In addition, 20 μLo f AccQ-Tag derivatizing reagent solution (Waters, Saint-Quentin, France) was added after which the solution washeated to 55°C for 10 min.
An aliquot of 1 μLw a si n j e c t e d and measured using UPLC-MS. Plasma amino acid enrich- ments were determined by gas chromatography-mass spec-trometry analysis (GC-MS; Agilent 7890A GC/5975C;M S D ,W i l m i n g t o n ,D E ) .T h ep l a s m a L-[ring-13C6]-phenyl- alanine enrichments were determined using selective ionmonitoring at m/z 336, 337, and 341 for unlabeled and la-beled ( 13C) phenylalanine.Standard regression curves were applied from a series of known standard enrichment values against the measured values to assess the linearity of the mass spectrometer and to account for any isotopefractionation.Muscle tissue analysis.Muscle connective and myofi- brillar protein-enriched fractions were isolated from ~100 mgo fw e tm u s c l et i s s u eb yh a n dh o m o g e n i z i n go ni c eu s i n gap e s -tle in a standard extraction buffer (10 μL·mg −1).The samples were spun for 15 min at 700 gand 4°C.The supernatant was transferred to a separate tube for Western blot analysis.
The pel- let was washed with 400 μLo fe x t r a c t i o nb u f f e rb e f o r e vortexing and centrifugation at 700 ga n d4 ° Cf o r1 0m i n .T h e supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with500μLd d H 2O before vortexing and centrifugation at 700 g and 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and 1 mLof homogenization buffer was added, and the material wassuspended by vortexing before transferring into microtubes containing 1.4 mm ceramic beads and Lysing Matrix D (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA).The microtubes were vigorously shaken four times for 45 s at 5.5 m·s −1(FastPrep-24 5G; MP Biomedicals) to mechanically lyse the protein network.Sam- ples were then left to rest at 4° C for 3 h before centrifugation at 700 gand 4°C for 20 min, discarding the supernatant and adding 1 mL of homogenization buffer.The microtubes wereshaken for 40 s at 5.5 m·s −1before centrifugation at 700 gand 4°C for 20 min.
The supernatant was discarded, and 1 mL of KCl buffer was added to the pellets before being vortexed andleft to rest overnight at 4°C. The next morning, samples werevortexed and centrifuged at 1600 gfor 20 min at 4°C.For the myofibrillar isolation the supernatant was trans- ferred to a separate tube.Then, 3.4 mL EtOH 100% wasadded, samples were vortexed, left for 2 h at 4°C and then cen-trifuged at 1600 g, for 20 min at 4°C.The supernatant was discarded and EtOH 70% was added to the pellet, vortexed and centrifuged again at 1600 g, for 20 min at 4°C.The super- natant was again discarded and the remaining pellet wassuspended in 2 mL of 6 M HCl in glass screw-cap tubes andleft to hydrolyze overnight at 110°C.For the connective protein isolation, the pellet, containing both immature and mature connective proteins, was mixed with1 mL KCl buffer and left for 2 h at 4°C.The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 1600 gf o r2 0m i na t4 ° C ,a n dt h e supernatant was discarded.
To the pellet 1 mL ddH2O wereadded, vortexed, left for 2 h at 4°C and then centrifuged at1600 g, for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the remaining pellet was suspended in 1 mL of 6M HCl in glassscrew-cap tubes and left to hydrolyze overnight at 110°C.After hydrolyzation, the free amino acids were then dis- solved in 25% acetic acid solution, passed over cation ex- change AG 50W-X8 resin columns (mesh size, 100 –200; ionic form, hydrogen; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,CA), washed five times with water and finally eluted with2M NH4OH.To determine myofibrillar and connective pro-tein L-[ring-13C6]-phenylalanine enrichments by GC-IRMS analysis, the purified amino acids were converted intoN-ethoxycarbonyl ethyl ester derivatives with ethylchloroformate.The samples were measured using a gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT 252; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany)equipped with an Ultra I GC-column (no.
19091A-112;Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) and combustion interfaceII (GC-C-IRMS). Ion masses 44, 45, and 46 were monitoredfor 13C phenylalanine.By establishing the relationship be- tween the enrichment of a series of L-[ring-13C6]-phenylala- nine, standards of variable enrichment and the enrichment of the N(O,S)-ethoxycarbonyl ethyl esters of these standards, the muscle –protein-bound enrichment of phenylalanine was determined.Whole body collagen turnover markers.Procollagen type I N propeptide (P1NP) and carboxy-terminal crosslinkingtelopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) were selected as markersof bone/collagen formation and bone/collagen resorption, re-spectively, in line with the recommendation by The Interna- tional Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and International Federa- tion of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) (33).P1NP and CTX-I weremeasured at four time points from plasma samples ( t=−120; t=0 ;t=1 2 0 ; t= 300 min).
Intact PINP and CTX-I were mea- sured using chemiluminescent immunometric assays on theIDS-iSYS instrument (Immunodiagnostic Systems, PLC), bythe Central Diagnostic Laboratory at the Maastricht UniversityMedical Centre (The Netherlands). Calculations.The fractional synthetic rate (FSR) of myo- fibrillar and muscle connective protein was calculated by di-viding the increment in myofibrillar and connective proteinenrichment by weighted mean precursor (plasma) amino acid COLLAGEN PROTEIN AND POSTEXERCISE RECOVERY Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise ®1795BASIC SCIENCES tracer enrichment.Consequently, myofibrillar and connective protein FSR were calculated as follows: FSR%/C1h−1/C0/C1 ¼Em2−Em1 Eprecursor /C2t/C18/C19 /C2100%1 ½/C138 Em1andEm2represent protein-bound L-[ring-13C6]-phenylala- nine, Eprecursor represents the average plasma free L-[ring- 13C6]-phenylalanine enrichment dur ing the tracer incorporation period, and t indicates the time interval (h) between biopsies.
Basal myofibrillar and muscle connective protein FSR were cal- culated based on plasma albumin enrichment at t=−180 min and myofibrillar and muscle connective enrichments att= 0 min (34,35). Statistical analysis.A power calculation was performed with differences in postprandial muscle FSR between the groupsas primary outcome measure.A minimum sample size of 14 par-ticipants per treatment, was calculated using a power of 80%, a significance level of 0.01667 (adjusted from 0.05 for multiple comparisons), an SD of 0.006%·h −1, and a difference in FSR of 0.008%·h−1between treatments (or ~20% when expressed as a relative difference).To account for potential drop-outs we in-cluded one extra participant per treatment for a total of 15 partic-ipants per group.All data in text are expressed as mean ± SD.Baseline characteristics and dietary intake between groups werecompared using a one-way ANOVA.
The trapezoidal rule ad- justed to baseline concentration ( t= 0) was applied to calculate the incremental area under curve (iAUC) of the amino acidconcentrations. Time-dependent variables (i.e., DOMS,plasma glucose, insulin, amino acid concentrations, and tracerenrichments) were analyzed by a mixed model ANOVA withtime as a within-subjects factor and treatment group as abetween-subjects factor.The analysis was carried out for the periodstarting at the time of protein or placebo ingestion ( t= 0 min) until the end of the experimental trial ( t= 300 min).In case of a signif- icant interaction effect, individual time points were analyzed usinga one-way ANOVA with the time points as the dependent variableand treatment as the independent variable.Non –time-dependent variables (i.e., postexercise myo fibrillar and muscle connective protein FSR and iAUC) were compared between treatmentgroups using a one-way ANOVA.
A secondary statisticalanalysis has been performed on myofibrillar and muscle con- nective protein FSR in a time-dependent manner with basal FSR and postprandial FSR using a two-factor repeated-measuresANOVA with time as a within-subjects factor and treatment groupas a between-subjects factor. Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons were performed where appropriate.Statisticalsignificance was set at P< 0.05.All calculations were per- formed using SPSS 24.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).RESULTS Participants ’characteristics and habitual dietary intake.There were no significant differences in the partici- pants’characteristics between the three treatment groups (Table 1).In line, there were no differences in habitual dietary intake between treatment groups (Table 1).Dietary vitamin Cintake of the 2 d before the experimental test day averaged 137 ± 49, 132 ± 48, and 146 ± 48 mg·d−1in WHEY, COLL, and PLA, respectively ( P> 0.05).
All participants ingested amounts of vitamin C above the Recommended Dietary Al- lowance of 90 mg·d−1for men and 75 mg·d−1for women (36).

Ingestion of collagen protein did not increase myofibrillar or muscle con-nective protein synthesis rates during exercise recovery when compared with the placebo condition. Resistance exercise has been shown to strongly increase both myofibrillar (1,37) and muscle connective (13,15,16) protein synthesis rates in vivo in humans.In the present study, we confirm these findings by reporting a substantial increasein myofibrillar (postabsorptive FSR of 0.008 ± 0.008%·h −1 FIGURE 3 —Postprandial plasma amino acid concentrations following whey, collagen, or placebo ingestion during recovery from a single boutof resistance exercise ( t=0–300 min) in the left column and iAUC for the post prandial time frame in the right column.Data are displayed forTAA (A, B), EAA (C, D) and NEAA (E, F).The dotted line within the leftcolumn graphs represents the ingestion of the test drink.Values representmeans ± SD, n= 15 per group.

Whereas previous studies typicallyapplied isolated/machine-based leg exercise (such as leg ex-t e n s i o na n dl e gp r e s s )t oa s s e s s the impact on myofibrillar and/or muscle connective protein synthesis rates (9,13,16,38), we applied a less isolated exer cise task in the form of six sets of barbell squats. The barbell squat is an exercise found moreoften in athletes ’training programs, requires more balancing and muscle coordination and, as such, may have resulted ingreater stimulation of m uscle connective protein synthesis rates.In support, Wilk et al.(39) showed greater quadriceps muscle activation with a free weight bar bell squat compared with leg press and leg extension exercise.It has been well established that protein ingestion can fur- ther increase myofibrillar protein synthesis rates during recov-ery from exercise (6,9,40,41).
The capacity to stimulate post-exercise myofibrillar protein synthesis has been attributed tothe postprandial rise in plasma amino acid concentrations,which stimulates anabolic signaling pathways and provides precursors for de novo protein synthesis (42,43). Here, we ob- served a rapid increase in plasma amino acid concentrationsfollowing both whey and collagen protein ingestion (Figs.3and 4).The postprandial rise in plasma amino acid concentra-tions differed substantially between the ingestion of whey ver-sus collagen protein, reflecting their differences in amino acidcomposition (Table 2; Fig.2).Whey protein ingestion resultedin a marked increase in plasma leucine concentrations which peaked 30 min after ingestion at ~400 μmol·L −1,w h i l et h ei n - gestion of collagen protein resulted in peak leucine concentra-tions of merely ~170 μmol·L −1.
On the other hand, collagen protein ingestion resulted in a more pronounced increase inplasma glycine, proline and hydroxyproline concentrations,reaching peak levels between 60 and 90 min after collagen in-gestion. Though hydroxyproline has no function as a precursorfor tissue protein synthesis, it provides us with proper insight in the rapid digestion of the ingested collagen protein and sub- sequent amino acid absorption (Figs.2 and 4G, H).Our obser-vations align with previous work by Alcock et al.(25) demon-strating that whereas dairy proteins are a superior source ofleucine, collagen protein forms a superior source of glycineand proline.Although glycine and proline are nonessentialamino acids, they represent important precursors for connec-tive tissue remodeling, comprising ~37% of all amino acids within this protein fraction.
It has been speculated that plasma glycine and proline availability may limit the postexercise FIGURE 5 —Plasma L-[ring-13C6]-phenylalanine enrichments (MPE) be- fore ( t=−120-0 min) and after whey, collagen, or placebo ingestion during recovery from a single bout of resistance exercise ( t=0–300 min).

The postprandial rise in circulating amino acids following whey protein ingestion strongly increased postexercise myofi-brillar protein synthesis rates when compared with the placebo condition (Fig. 6A).This finding is in line with previous stud- ies reporting that ingestion of 20 g of high-quality proteinstrongly stimulates myofibrillar protein synthesis (9,41,44).In contrast, whey protein ingestion did not further increasemuscle connective protein synthesis rates during recoveryfrom exercise (Fig.6B).This seems to be in line with most(13,20 –23) but not all (24) studies investigating the impact of (dairy) protein ingestion on connective protein synthesis rates in muscle.Holm et al.suggested that the impact of post- exercise protein ingestion, if any, may be more prominent dur-ing the latter stages of recovery from exercise.
However, in re-cent studies, we failed to detect any impact of ingesting up to40 g dairy protein before sleep on connective protein synthesisrates during an elongated overnight recovery period (7.5 h) inboth young (16) and older (17) adults. Therefore, based on ourprevious work and the outcome of the present study, we con- clude that ingestion of a high-quality dairy protein stimulates myofibrillar but not muscle connective protein synthesis ratesduring recovery from an acute bout of resistance exercise inrecreational athletes.Although it is evident that exercise stimulates muscle connective protein synthesis rates (13,15,16), thereby con-tributing to the conditioning of the connective protein net- w o r ki nm u s c l e ,t h u sf a r ,i td oes not seem to be sensitive to a postprandial rise in plasma amino acid availability.
However, it has been proposed that a stimulation of muscleconnective protein synthesis rates may be dependent on theamino acid profile or the postprandial increase in aminoacid availability (25,29). Mu ch of the muscle connective protein network consists of collagen strands, which areabundant in glycine, proline and hydroxyproline (25%,12%, and 13.5%, respectively).Therefore, it has been pro- posed that the postexercise in crease in connective protein synthesis rates may be limit ed by the provision of ample glycine and proline precursors for collagen synthesis(16,29).In contrast to dairy p rotein, dietary collagen pro- vides ample amounts of glycine and proline that could sup-port a greater postexercise increase in muscle connectiveprotein synthesis rates.Here , we assessed the impact of col- l a g e np r o t e i ni n g e s t i o no nb o t hm yofibrillar protein and, for the first time, muscle connec tive protein synthesis rates (Fig.6).
In contrast to whey protein, collagen protein inges-tion did not elevate myofibrillar protein synthesis rates. Thismay be attributed to the lower essential amino acid contentof the 30 g collagen protein when compared with 30 g whey protein (~5 vs ~13 g essential amino acids, respectively)and/or more specifically to the differences in leucine con-tent (0.8 vs 3 g leucine, respectively).In line with our re- sults, Oikawa et al.(19) reported less of an increase in myo- fibrillar protein synthesis rates following ingestion of 30 gcollagen versus 30 g whey protein ingestion, both at restand during recovery from unilateral leg exercise.We extendon previous work by assessing, for the first time, whethercollagen protein ingestion can stimulate muscle connective proteins synthesis rates during recovery from exercise.
Wehypothesized that dairy protein may not provide sufficient amounts of glycine and proline to maximize postexercise muscle connective protein synthesis rates (25), and, there-fore, that dietary collagen pro tein may be the pr eferred pro- tein source to stimulate muscle c onnective protein synthesis rates. In contrast to our hypothesis, despite the substantialpostprandial rise in circulating glycine, proline and hy-droxyproline concentrations, we failed to detect a further in-crease in muscle connective pro tein synthesis rates during the first 5 h of recovery from exercise (Fig.6B).Although promising results of collagen supplementation have been re-ported for tendon (29), bone (45), and fat-free mass (46),muscle connective protein synthesis rates do not seem tobe modulated by collagen ingestion during acute, postexer-cise recovery in recreationally active young athletes.
Fur-ther research will be warranted to assess whether higherprotein doses of collagen protein or blends of dairy and col- lagen protein will be effective to further increase muscle connective protein synthesis rates at rest and/or during re-covery from different types of exercise. Blood markers, such as P1NP and CTX-I, may be useful to assess the effect of exercise and nutritional interventionson whole body collagen synthesis and breakdown (47).Here, we observed a small increase in P1NP concentrationsfollowing resistanc e exercise.This find ing is in accordance with a recent meta-analysis concluding that exercise in gen- eral results in a very small increase in P1NP concentrations.However, insufficie nt data were available to evaluate the P1NP response to an acute bout of resistance exercise spe-cifically (48).CTX-I concentrations declined in all condi-tions in the present study until t= 120 min, in accordance with the well-known circadian rhythm of CTX-I (49).
Also,in line with previous work (50), we observed that whole body collagen breakdown, as indicated by CTX-I, was inhibited by protein ingestion (for both WHEY and COLL),compared with the ingestion of water (PLA). In the present study we show that both whey and collagen protein ingestion do not further increase muscle connectiveprotein synthesis rates during the first few hours of recoveryfrom exercise.Previously, we have shown that ingested pro-tein provides precursors to support muscle connective protein synthesis rates, as we observed that (intrinsically labeled) ca- sein protein derived amino acids are incorporated in de novo synthesized muscle connective protein (16,17).
Though it isevident that dietary protein is required to support the http://www.acsm-msse.org 1800 Official Journal of the American College of Sports MedicineBASIC SCIENCES conditioning of the muscle connective protein network, it seems clear that the early recovery phase from exercise doesnot require more amino acid precursors or specific dietarystimuli. The acute nature of the present study allows us to only speculate on the relevance of the amount and quality of dietary protein consumption (and collagen protein in particular) re-quired to support muscle connective tissue conditioning whenapplied over a more prolonged intervention period.Further-more, in the present study we assessed the impact of wheyand collagen protein on connective protein within skeletalmuscle tissue.Whether the reported findings also translate toother connective protein networks, such as connective pro- teins in ligaments, tendons, and bone remains to be elucidated.
The latter structures contain a much higher collagen content(e.g., ~85% collagen content dry weight, 51) when comparedwith muscle tissue (~5%, 22). De novo synthesis of collagen-rich tissues would require greater amounts of glycineand proline to support tissue remodeling and may, therefore,be more dependent on collagen protein ingestion.Future stud-ies will address these issues to elucidate whether there is a role for collagen protein in supporting the adaptive response of connective proteins to exercise in the various musculoskeletaltissues in both health and disease.CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, resistance exercise increases both myofibril- lar and muscle connective protein synthesis rates in male andfemale recreational athletes.Whey protein ingestion during re-covery from exercise further increases myofibrillar but notmuscle connective protein synthesis rates.
Collagen protein in-gestion during recovery from acute exercise does not increasemyofibrillar nor muscle connective protein synthesis rates.
