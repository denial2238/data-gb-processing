Negative Lifestyle Factors Speci ﬁc to Aging Persons Living with HIV and Multimorbidity William Pastor Smith, PsyD, MEd, MA, RD, LD1 Abstract The primary goal of medical care during the pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) era was to keep persons living with human immu- node ﬁciency virus (HIV) alive, whereas since the advent of ART, the treatment objective has shifted to decreasing viral loads and infectiousness while increasing CD4 +T-cell counts and longevity.The health crisis, ho wever, is in preventing and managing multimor- bidity (ie, type 2 diabetes), which develops at a more accelerated or accentuated pace among aging persons living with HIV.Relative to the general population and age-match ed uninfected adults, it may be more dif ﬁcult for aging HIV-positive persons who also suffer from multimorbidity to improve negative lifesty le factors to the extent that th eir behaviors could support the prevention and management of diseases.
With recommendations and a viable solution, this article explores the impact of n egative lifestyle factors (ie, poor mental health, suboptimal nutrition, physical inactivity, alcohol use) on the he alth of aging individuals living with HIV. Keywords Negative lifestyle factors, aging, HIV Plain Language Summary How Negative Lifestyle Factors Impact Aging Persons Living with HIV This literature review highlights negative lifestyle factors experienced by aging persons living with HIV, including poor mental health (i.e., depression, cognitive decline), poor nutrition, physical inactivity, alcohol use, sexually transmitted infection, poorsleep quality, and treatment noncompliance as promoting diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease) and early death.A possible solution to decreasing or eliminating negative lifestyle factors in the aging HIV-positive pop- ulation is to develop disease prevention-focused teams in clinical and community settings.
However, if team development isimpractical, primary healthcare providers should routinely assess and monitor lifestyle factors (i.e., cognitive decline) and, if needed, provide appropriate referrals to licensed or certi ﬁed specialists (e.g., psychologist, clinical dietitian, medical exercise spe- cialist, or health coach). Date received: 28 July 2023; revised: 28 February 2024; accepted: 18 March 2024.Introduction In 2018, more than half (51%) of people in the United States (U.S.) with diagnosed human immunode ﬁciency virus (HIV) were aged 50 and older, and approximately 1 in 6 HIV diag-noses in 2018 was made in individuals older than 50 years.1 In 2018, an estimated 1.2 million Americans had HIV,379,000 of whom were 55 and older.
1Owing to the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the projected life expectancy of HIV-infected persons has increased.2However, in a study linking HIV, ART, and longevity, Althoff et al2reported that, even though there was an improvement in life expectancy inpersons living with HIV on ART in the U.S. and Canada,based on treatment onset at the age of 20, there were still life- expectancy disparities.In the 2012 −2015 period, the life- expectancy disparity in HIV-positive Black versus White menwho have sex with men (MSM), respectively, was an additional50.9 years and 60.3 years; and during that same timeframe, life-expectancy disparity in persons with injection drug use (IDU) 1Wellness Data, LLC, Washington, DC, USA Corresponding Author: William Pastor Smith, Wellness Data, LLC, 312 12th Street, NE, Washington,DC 20002, USA.

Importantly, Althoff et al2further noted that a 20% reduction in drug- and alcohol-related mortalitywould have the greatest life-expectancy bene ﬁt for Black MSM, White women, and people with a history of IDU. Other studies have identi ﬁed the potential roles of structural racism and stigma, which can reduce access to and retention in health care in the unrelenting racial disparities in Black MSM as well as disparities among those with IDU histories.2 Irrespective of increased life expectancy and aside from managing HIV, individuals living with the infection are also confronted by and struggling with multimorbidity, especiallyas they age.
3Available evidence indicates that multimorbidity —ie, cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and hypertension (HTN) —in aging individuals living with HIV may be accelerated or accentuated by a nexus among HIV infection, biological aging, and immunosenescence.3,4 Many —often mutable —psychological and behavioral lifestyle factors associated with diseases may accelerate or accentuate disease conditions in aging HIV-positive persons. Figure 1 illustrates the interactions between negative lifestylefactors, aging persons living with HIV, and morbidities.The overarching purpose of this article is twofold.
First, with recommendations, its objec tive is to explore the extent to which lifestyle factors, including mental health (ie, depres- sion and cognitive decline), nutrition, exercise (or physical activity), smoking, alcohol use, sexually transmitted infections(STIs), and treatment adherence are explicably linked to the health and well-being of aging individuals living with HIV and multimorbidity. The second objective of this work is toprovide a viable solution for mitigating or eliminating those negative lifestyle factors through lifestyle-focused care pro- vided by a client-centered, preventive-clinical, interdisciplinaryteam.Mental Health In the U.S., the encumbrance of depressive symptoms anddepression among persons living with HIV is approximately25%, three times higher than HIV-uninfected persons.5As burdensome as depression, 35 –50% of adults with HIV in the U.S.
exhibit some form of HIV-associated neurocogni-tive disorder (HAND) ranging from mild asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment to HIV-associated dementia. 6 Depression and cognitive declin e in older HIV-positive indi- viduals elevate the probability of increased morbidities (ie, T2D and HTN),7,8promote negative lifestyle behaviors (ie, treatment noncompliance, smoking, substance use),9–11as well as fuel an early death.12 Depression and cognitive decline may not only be a bidirec- tional sequela for each other but synergistically continue todeteriorate the overall physical and psychological health of older persons living with HIV and multimorbidity.13It is crucial to highlight that psychosocial challenges (ie, loneliness Figure 1.

As negative manipulators of the health and well-being of older persons living with HIV and multi-morbidity, the following discussions explore (a) depression and its connection to psychosocial issues and (b) cognitive decline.
Depressive Symptoms, Depression, and Aging with HIV Markedly, depression and other psychiatric conditions can overlap with HIV and morbidities in aging persons livingwith HIV. 14For example, Chhatre and colleagues14explored the intersection of physical (HIV) and mental health (psychiat- ric) conditions and medical comorbidities in a sample of218,133,630 (weighted) with .18% (n =39,264,053) diagnosed with HIV.The researchers identi ﬁed those with and without psychiatric disorders (ie, mood/depressive disorder, anxiety,post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]).The six medical comor- bidities included pain, cancer, cardiovascular disease, substance disorders, metabolic disorders, and infectious diseases.Participants were divided into four groups: HIV-positive, psy- chiatric comorbidity (Group 1); HIV-positive only (Group 2); psychiatric disorder only (Group 3); and non-HIV or psychiatricdisorder (Group 4).
The average age per group was 48.3 ±11.7 (Group 1), 46.5 ±12.9 (Group 2), 48.7 ±16.9 (Group 3), and 45.9±17.7 (Group 4). Forty-three percent of the HIV-positive group had psychiatric comorbidities, relative to 19% of the non-HIV group.Half of the HIV-positive psychiatric disorder group had at least one medical comorbidity, with pain beingthe most frequent (23%).Overall, the association between indi- vidual medical comorbidity and group status demonstrated that the HIV-positive, psychiatric comorbidity group had thehighest odds of presenting with the six types of medical comorbidity.All-cause mortality in aging persons living with HIV has been identi ﬁed to be correlated with depressive disorders.For example, So-Armah et al 15examined depression and all-cause mortality in 129,140 HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected U.S.veterans who participated in the Veteran Aging Cohort Study (VACS).The subjects were over 50; 30% had HIV, and 24% died over a median follow-up of 11 years.
AmongHIV-positive individuals, there was a 24% increased mortality risk associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Along with increasing morbidities and mortality among older individuals living with HIV and multimorbidity, depres- sion coalesces with psychosocial issues such as social isolation, as well as the stigma attached to aging with HIV.16–18 Yoo-Jeong and colleagues18investigated the extent to which loneliness mediates the effect of HIV-related stigma on depres- sive symptoms in a sample of 148 older ( ≥50 years) persons living with HIV.The analysis demonstrated that loneliness mediated the association between stigma and depressive symp- toms.In another study linked to depression and psychosocialissues, Marg and colleagues 19assessed successful aging among older persons living with HIV (n =62) compared with older individuals without HIV (n =48) in Palm Springs,California.
The prevalence of two or more comorbid conditions across the sample was 59.1%, with persons living with HIV being more likely to report depression (35.5% vs 12.5%). Even though a statistical correlation or prediction betweendepression and loneliness was not assessed, there was a signi ﬁ- cant association between not working or volunteering and feel- ings of isolation among aging persons living with HIV,whereas, with older persons living without HIV, there was a signiﬁcant af ﬁliation between feelings of isolation and not living with someone.Furthermore, in Marg and colleagues ’ﬁndings, 19there was no noteworthy difference between reported feelings of isolation among persons living with HIV and persons without HIV,which could have been associated with most HIV-positive indi- viduals having disclosed their HIV status to friends and family, indicating relatively high social support among the studysample.
Overall, ﬁndings suggested that older persons living with HIV experienced successful aging to a similar degree to their peers without HIV. It is important to mention, however,that signi ﬁcant support networks were available for HIV-positive individuals in Palm Springs, including Let ’s Kick AIDS Survivor Syndrome and Positive Life.Still, theresults exempli ﬁed that depression and social isolation remained important issues threatening successful aging among older persons living with HIV.Screening for depression should be a common practice in both clinical and community settings serving aging persons living with HIV and multimorbidity, and, if needed, treatmentshould be provided or appropriate referrals made.Healthcare providers should ensure adequate social support networks for aging persons living with HIV and multimorbidity, such ascommunity-support organizations.
Healthcare providers also must accept assessing and treating depressive symptoms and depression as essential components of providing comprehen-sive care, whereby supporting successful aging in older persons living with HIV and morbidities. Cognitive Decline, Aging, and HIV Cognitive decline is hastened by a de ﬁcit in cognitive (or brain) reserve, re ﬂecting the amount of damage that neurons (nerve cells) and neuronal connections can absorb without compromis- ing the support for the physiological functions needed to sustain cognition.20Senescence or biological aging is associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline in older adults.20Still, it is relevant to emphasize that cognitive aging in older adults can take distinctly different forms depending on variousfactors (ie, genetics and environment).21 Based on HAND, HIV affects the immune system, nervous system, and brain, potentially depleting the cognitive reserve inat least two ways.
22First, HIV can cross the blood −brain barrier and infect and kill glial cells (cells needed to support neuronal health) while producing neurotoxins. Second, HIV is consid-ered a neuroin ﬂammatory disease and has been shown in clin- ical HIV studies to reduce cognitive reserve and induce cognitive impairments.Furthermore, in older persons livingSmith 3 with HIV, cognitive dysfunction may be increased due to the synergistic consequences of biological aging, HIV itself, and comorbid conditions (ie, T2D).22 Regardless of age and absence of a HAND diagnosis, cogni- tive decline may be accelerated or accentuated due to HIV infection alone.For example, Sheppard et al23explored the cog- nitive decline trajectory in 146 neurocognitively normal partic-ipants of different races and genders.These individuals were assigned into one of four groups based on age ( ≤40 years and ≥50 years) and HIV status (positive and negative).
The results indicated a nearly ﬁve-fold risk for developing neuro- cognitive disorder over approximately one year among HIV-positive individuals, irrespective of age. In olderHIV-positive adults, however, lower baseline cognitive reserve, prospective memory, and verbal ﬂuency individually predicted incidents of neurocognitive disorders at follow-up.23 Aging persons living with HIV and multimorbidity may be at a greater risk of experiencing cognitive decline than their non-HIV counterparts, especially if they do not subscribe toor understand how an enriched environmental paradigm could support positive versus negative neuroplasticity.Positive neu- roplasticity refers to the nervous system ’s ability to develop connections between neurons in response to novel, stimulating, and challenging stimuli, whereas negative neuroplasticity refers to the nervous system ’s tendency to deteriorate in response to little or no stimulation.
24Multiple factors are associated with positive neuroplasticity, such as education, intellectual pursuits, physical activity, proper nutrition, adequate sleep, social inter-action, and cognitive remediation therapy (ie, playing a comput- erized game designed to improve visual attention and processing speed). 24–31Conversely, factors linked to negative neuroplasticity may include poor health, low health literacy, a sedentary lifestyle, increased body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), substance use, poor sleep quality,suboptimal nutrition, depression, anxiety, and loneli- ness.24,26,27,30,32 –34 Data are scant related to older persons living with HIV and positive and negative neuroplasticity.However, Krueger and colleagues28explored the association of cognitive activity and current neurocognitive performance in a sample of 176 olderHIV-positive persons with a median age =58.7 years.
Based on participation frequency, the cognitive activities assessed as mediators of positive neuroplasticity included reading newspa-pers, magazines, or books; visiting museums or libraries; and attending a concert or play. Results showed that a higher regu- larity of activity was linked to better brain health in global cog-nition, semantic memory, and perceptual speed.Comparatively, loneliness is correlated with poorer cognition (or as a stimulus for negative neuroplasticity).Han et al, 33for example, explored greater loneliness among older Black adults with HIV as being associated with poorer cognitive function.The sample was composed of 370 participants (177 with HIV, 193 withoutHIV, age mean =58.8 years, 73.9% male, 68.9% Black) resid- ing in the U.S.Even though the HIV-positive Black adults reported less loneliness than the HIV-positive White adults,ﬁndings suggested that greater loneliness advanced poorercognition among the HIV-positive Black adults.
Linking social, race-related chronic stress with loneliness and poorer cognition, the researchers suggested that older Black adults with HIV relative to older White adults with HIV may experi-ence greater stress from multiple sources acting on neurobiolog- ical functioning. 33In general, aging persons living with HIV must be assessed for cognitive impairment periodically, and,if needed, positive neuroplasticity stimuli should be recom- mended, and negative neuroplasticity initiators must be identi- ﬁed and remedied.Nutrition Even though ART has lessened the burden of wasting syn- drome, lean-tissue depletion, hypermetabolic states, malabsorp- tion, and cachexia in HIV-positive individuals,35,36aging persons living with HIV still experience accelerated or accentu- ated morbidities or noncommunicable diseases, such as CVD, T2D, osteoporosis, gastrointestinal disorders, and chronickidney disease.
37–39The diseases experienced by aging HIV-positive individuals are often fueled by suboptimal nutri- tion, such as vitamin and mineral de ﬁciencies, and consuming foods high in sugar, salt, and saturated and trans fats.36 Hence, the negative impacts of suboptimal or poor nutritionon micronutrients, body composition changes, and gut dysfunc-tion in HIV-positive older adults will be discussed below. Micronutrients Adequate levels of vitamins, minerals, and trace elements are based on Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) levels, and there is growing evidence that routine intake of multivitamins ormineral supplements may improve immune function in older adults.35Notably, no conclusive evidence exists supporting the dietary supplement use independently based on improvinginfectious outcomes in well-nourished, HIV-infected individu- als.
35Nonetheless, it is likely that older adults living with HIV, particularly those with poor diets or who live inpoverty, may bene ﬁt from regular consumption of multivita- min, mineral, and trace element supplements that contain micronutrients at DRI levels.
35 Micronutrient de ﬁciencies are common in the aging popula- tion, but their extent varies from individual to individual, region to region, and country to country.40Deﬁciencies may be mod- ulated by socioeconomic status, food insecurity, mental health (ie, depression, cognitive decline), social isolation, and physical disabilities (ie, loss of teeth and limited mobility).40,41 Furthermore, with aging, optimal nutrition may be impeded by sensory changes, including a decline in sight, smell, and taste acuity.40Deviations in smell and taste, for example, may make food less appetizing, leading to decreased nutrient-dense food intake.41 Based on a comprehensive literature review, Maggini et al42 indicated that approximately 35% of adults aged 50 years orolder living in Europe, the U.S., and Canada have one or more micronutrient de ﬁciencies.
Suboptimal micronutrient4 Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care intake in older adults has been reported in the community (vita- mins A, B12, and D, and zinc) as well as in long-term care facil- ities (vitamins A, D, and E), while lower food intake has been associated with de ﬁciencies in calcium, iron, zinc, B vitamins, and vitamin E.42The authors further implied that to maintain immunocompetence, the micronutrients needed include vita- mins A, C, D, E, B2, B6, and B12, folic acid, iron, selenium,and zinc. Given the synergism between HIV itself (ie, chronic immune activation and in ﬂammation), accelerated or accentu- ated immunosenescence (ie, in ﬂammaging), multimorbidity, and ART —older individuals living with HIV may require sup- plementation (ie, vitamin D and calcium at an earlier stage of life).
43,44 Body Composition Changes Relative to the general aging population, older persons living with HIV are experiencing multiple body composition changes, leading to accelerated or accentuated multimorbidityand mortality. 38,45These changes are driven synergistically by HIV, ART, an obesogenic environment (high-fat diet and sedentary lifestyle) and aging38,45while simultaneously fueling cardiometabolic diseases (ie, obesity, T2D, CVD, liver disease), osteoporosis, frailty (a syndrome of physiological degeneration in the elderly),46increased risk of hospitalizations and death.38,45 –47Body composition changes involve total body weight gain, increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT), muscle loss and function (sarcopenia), and decreased bone mineraldensity (BMD).38,45,47 –49Brief discussions speci ﬁc to those changes and how they could impact the health and well-being of aging HIV-positive individuals are as follows.Weight Gain and Obesity.
Research has shown that weight gain after ART initiation was associated with lower mortality among initially underweight and normal-weight persons living withHIV, 50whereas excessive weight gain and obesity present, exacerbate, accelerate, or accentuate multiple health-related issues in aging HIV-positive individuals.45In a review, Bailin et al45explored obesity and weight gain in persons living with HIV. The authors indicated that causes of weight gain and obesity are multifactorial among persons living with HIV,involving contemporary ART agents (principally integrase strand transfer inhibitors [INSTIs] and tenofovir alafenamide [TAF]), an obesogenic environment (high-fat diet and physicalinactivity), shifting demographics (ie, an increase in the aging population), and older individuals being predisposed to obesity.
45 To gauge the extent to which overweight and obesity increase in persons living with HIV, Mavarani and associates51 compared body weight, BMI (kg/m2) and WHR (a measure of central adiposity)52in persons living with HIV (N =858) and HIV-negative controls (N =1170) from the German Ruhr area for over 5 years follow-up; median age at baseline was 55years. Results showed that persons living with HIV had a lower weight than the controls at baseline but experienced greater increases in weight and BMI after 5 years.Afteradjusting the analyses for smoking, the individuals living with HIV had an even higher weight difference compared to the controls after 5 years.The investigators noted that the pro- portion of overweight and obesity in HIV-positive individualswas still much lower than in the controls, illustrating that the BMI shift among the HIV-positive individuals re ﬂected the “return to health ”effects of ART.
Although, as an indication of weight gain, the observed BMI shifts after 5 years in the HIV-positive persons might have represented the aligning of their BMI with the controls —but not a “return to health. ” In clinical and research settings, the BMI is used most fre- quently to assess weight status; however, WHR is a much better anthropometric index for indicating cardiometabolicdisease risk.53Based on Mavarani and associates ’results in the above study,51a lower WHR change was demonstrated after 5 years for persons living with HIV compared with theHIV-negative controls, despite a higher WHR at baseline.The researchers 51indicated that metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and liver steatosis were more common inHIV-positive individuals and connected to abdominal obesity, 54,55which may have explained the less than favorable WHR at baseline in the people living with HIV compared to theHIV-negative controls.
Generally, healthcare providers must closely monitor weight gain, particularly in the abdominal region, in aging persons living with HIV to deter thosechanges from fueling morbidities. Increased VAT, Sarcopenia, and Low BMD.In the aging HIV-positive population, elevated VAT or intra-abdominal fatis associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases (ie, CVD, T2D) 56,57; and the promoters of VAT include current ART drugs (ie, INSTIs and TAF), high-fat diets, sedentary life-styles, and aging.Whereas sarcopenia or loss of muscle mass and function could lead to frailty, 58potentially progressing to falls, delirium, hospitalization, institutionalization, and mortal-ity.
59Like intra-abdominal weight gain, the loss of muscle mass and function may be brought about by ART medications, phys- ical inactivity, poor nutrition, and aging.60In a review, data showed that the prevalence of sarcopenia in persons living with HIV was 24.1% in a sample of 2267 participants, and com- paratively, HIV-positive persons presented 6.1% greater oddsof sarcopenia than people without HIV. 49Speci ﬁc to low BMD in aging persons living with HIV, aging itself, lifestyle factors (ie, low calcium and vitamin D intake, physical inactiv-ity), ART drugs (ie, protease inhibitors) are contributors leading to osteoporosis, frailty, fractures, increased risk of hospitaliza- tion and decreased quality of life.38,61,62Notably, osteoporosis can be three times more frequent in HIV-infected individuals than in non-infected persons.63 When considering instigators of frailty in aging HIV- positive persons, elevated VAT, sarcopenia and low BMD must be collectively factored in.
For example, Hawkins and associates64investigated abdominal obesity, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis as a collaborative link to frailty in a sample of 399 men, consisting of 199 men living with HIV and 200 men living without HIV, with a median age of 60 years.Smith 5 Results illustrated that frailty prevalence was 16% in men living with HIV relative to 8% in men living without HIV. Speci ﬁcally, higher waist circumference, VAT, sarcopenia, and femoral neck osteoporosis were associated with increasedodds of frailty.64 Principally, regular aerobic exercise, resistance training, and consumption of a nutrient-dense (ie, adequate protein intake),hypocaloric diet may be recommended to substantially reduce weight, VAT and maintain muscle for the general population and aging persons living with HIV.
65Speci ﬁc to BMD, positive lifestyle factors (ie, suf ﬁcient calcium and vitamin D intake sup- ported by supplementation and physical activity) and BMD screening are critical to ensuring against frailty, fractures, andhospitalization while improving the quality of life for older HIV-positive individuals. 38Undoubtedly, this will require a well-organized plan with key health professionals (ie, exercisespecialists, dietitians, physical therapists, and orthopedists) to successfully address and manage such issues as VAT, sarcope- nia, and low BMD in aging persons living with HIV.
Gut Dysfunction Individuals with chronic HIV infection who receive ART may display intestinal dysbiosis and increased microbial transloca- tion.66Consequently, signi ﬁcant shifts in the composition, diversity, and functional aspects of the intestinal microbiome are often observed in aging persons living with HIV due to normal aging and HIV infection.67These changes are mani- fested by dysbiosis or a disruption of the commensal homeosta- sis between the host and gut microbiota,67which are associated with pathological conditions, including in ﬂammatory bowel disease, obesity, T2D, CVD, and neurodegenerative diseases (ie, Alzheimer ’s, Parkinson ’s).68–72 Microbial translocation has been described as a model of immune activation, whereby microbial translocation of bacte- rial products across damaged mucosal surfaces, primarily in the gut, has been posited to contribute to immune activation.4 Notably, the GI tract mucosa is a major site of T-cell destruction in the ﬁrst few weeks following HIV infection, and damage continues throughout all stages of HIV disease.4Importantly, the destruction leads to poor epithelial surface integrity, facili- tating the translocation of microbial products such as lipopoly- saccharide (LPS, endotoxin) across leaky mucosa into thesystemic circulation, resulting in endotoxemia.
66 Once LPS enters the bloodstream, it binds to lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins (LBPs) and is then trans-ported to a cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) and further to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which activates the innate immune system via monocytes/macrophages. 73This action results in the release of proin ﬂammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF α).
Due to the early loss of gut mucosal integrity, LPS becomes asource of continuous immune activation and a proin ﬂammatory state, 74further exacerbated by immunosenescence (in ﬂammag- ing) in older persons living with HIV.75The production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may support greater gut microbiota diversity.76SCFAs are crucial in the relationship between host and gut microbiota, explaining the correlation between gut ﬂora alterations and increased frailty in the elderly.77Speci ﬁcally, SCFAs are important metabolites, including acetate, butyrate, and propionate, pro- duced by the fermentation of ﬁber-rich food or non-digestible carbohydrates that escape digestion and absorption in the small intestine.78Studies conducted in the general population show that a diet rich in re ﬁned grains and sugars is negatively correlated with fecal concentrations and SCFAs, while con- sumption of large amounts of fruit and vegetables has a positive correlation with fecal concentrations and SCFAs.76 There needs to be more literature related to aging persons living with HIV, gut dysbiosis, and diet.
Armstrong and col- leagues,79nevertheless, explored gut microbiome in ﬂuences on metabolic health in 113 men. The analysis included a typical diet, HIV, ART, and lipodystrophy (LD) status, and other demographic characteristics such as age and BMI.Ofnote, LD is linked to early ART drugs and is de ﬁned as the redistribution of body fat; for example, less fat in the face, arms and legs and more fat in the abdominal region.54The cohort included men who have sex with women (MSW; n = 22) and HIV-positive and -negative MSM (n =91).The HIV-negative MSM participated in activities that put them athigh risk of contracting HIV (HR-MSM; ie, having a history of unprotected anal intercourse with two or more male or male-to-female transgender partners).
79Data have shown that the altered microbiome in HIV-infected individuals80and HR-MSM were proin ﬂammatory in vitro and gnotobiotic mice.80,81 Armstrong and colleagues ’ﬁndings in the above study79 indicated a central role of in ﬂammatory processes linked with bacterial translocation, as assessed by LBP and correlatedwith intestinal microbes, dietary, and demographic attributes such as age and BMI. For example, age was a signi ﬁcant predic- tor of impaired metabolic health in the cohort and negativelyassociated with B.adolescentis , and notably, the oldest (median age =60, ranging from 54-64 years) group in the cohort were the HIV-positive MSM on ART with LD.Speci ﬁct oB.
adolescentis , it has been shown to prevent immu- nosenescence when fed in a probiotic food to aged rats 82and to have bene ﬁcial effects on barrier function in a murine model.83 Similarly, BMI was a predictor of reduced metabolic health in the cohort even though obese individuals were excluded from the study, and like age, the highest median BMI, 25.8(23.0-28.0) kg/m 2, was among the HIV-positive MSM on ART with LD.
Furthermore, results demonstrated that the genus Prevotella was negatively associated with metabolic disease and positively aligned with dietary ﬁber, while the genera Coproccus (butyrate-producing bacteria linked with increased SCFAs) and the Dorea species , respectively, corre- lated with LBP negatively and positively.79 Compared to the results speci ﬁct oPrevotella in Armstrong and colleagues ’study,79other research has uncovered different health outcomes linked to distinctly different dietary6 Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care components.
For instance, Prevotella copri, the most abundant species of Prevotella, promoted poor glucose response through increased insulin resistance and the production of branched- chain amino acids in mice fed a high-fat diet.84Additionally, in a sample of 359 persons living with HIV with a median age=51 years, results demonstrated that Alcohol Use Disorder Identi ﬁcation Test (AUDIT) scores were positively associated with dysbiosis, intestinal leakage, CD8+T-cell late differentiation, and the Prevotellaceae bacterial family (includ- ing the genus Prevotella ).85In general, compromised gut health in older persons living with HIV is multifaceted, involving HIV, ART drugs, aging, BMI, and suboptimal nutrition such as a low- ﬁber diet. Although, in part, a nutrient-dense diet with high ﬁber can improve gut integrity in the general aging population and older people living with HIV and multimorbidity.
Exercise Aging adults living with HIV may be at a greater risk of devel-oping accelerated or accentuated frailty because of physical inactivity. In their study, Umbleja and colleagues 86explored physical function impairment and frailty in a sample comprisedof 266 persons living with HIV (median age =51 years) on ART, 81% of whom were male, 45% were Black, and 28% had HTN.The analyses indicated that older age, Black race,greater BMI, and physical inactivity were associated with phys- ical function impairment, while depression and HTN were linked to prefrailty or frailty, 86suggesting the relevance of exer- cise for improving physical and mental health.The following discussions focus on the bene ﬁts of habitual exercise as primar- ily a supporter against frailty and its contributors, such asincreased VAT, sarcopenia, low BMD, and poor cardiorespira- toryﬁtness (CRF) in aging HIV-positive adults.
Early frailty, hastened by multimorbidity, in the aging HIV-positive population could increase the risk for falls, wors- ening mobility, disability, hospitalization, and mortality. 87 Thus, improving functional limitations by engaging in a chronic exercise program should be preventive medicine against early frailty.Shah et al88conducted a randomized, con- trolled clinical trial involving 67 community-dwelling olderadults with HIV and mild-to-moderate functional limitations.The participants were divided into physical activity counseling and control groups.The study ﬁndings suggested that a physical activity program grounded in the self-determination theory model of behavioral change can improve physical function (ie, gait speed, endurance and strength measures, and physicalactivity levels).
88 Frailty in old age is posited to increase the risk of dying from chronic in ﬂammatory diseases rather than infectious diseases.89 As aging persons living with HIV are burdened with increased inﬂammation precipitated by accelerated or accentuated immu- nosenescence and HIV-related chronic immune activation, theyare more likely to die from an in ﬂammatory disease (ie, CVD, T2D, chronic kidney disease, cancer). 4,89Exercise has been identi ﬁed to lessen in ﬂammatory states and disease-relatedoutcomes, and this phenomenon speci ﬁc to HIV-related in ﬂam- mation was examined by d ’Ettorre et al.90The authors con- cluded that the introduction of regular physical exercise in the clinical management of HIV infection could potentially resultin a decrease in immune activation, with a concomitant reduc- tion in damage linked to chronic in ﬂammatory conditions, such as CVD and other non-AIDS-de ﬁning illnesses (ie, T2D).
d ’Ettorre and colleagues also posited that regular physi- cal exercise could improve neuropsychological and metabolic (ie, insulin resistance and glucose tolerance) function. 90 As precursors to and interactors with frailty, many individu- als living with HIV experience accelerated or accentuated age-related body composition changes, including increasedVAT, sarcopenia, and decreased BMD.38,48,49,91,92To counter- act increased VAT, sarcopenia, and low BMD, prescribed and consistent exercise routines, in part, maybe a remedy to bodycomposition change issues for older persons living with HIV.Jankowski et al, 93for example, compared the effects of pre- scribed exercise on the body composition of sedentarypersons living with HIV (n =27) and uninfected controls (n = 28) aged 50 –75 years.Participants completed 12 weeks of moderate-intensity exercise and were randomized to moderate-or high-intensity exercise for an additional 12 weeks.
Results demonstrated that exercise reduced total and visceral fat in older persons living with HIV and controls. Although not sig-niﬁcant by serostatus, controls tended to gain more lean mass, which suggested that a greater emphasis on resistance exercise may have been needed to increase muscle in the HIV-positiveparticipants.93Furthermore, Ghayomzadeh and colleagues94 explored the effects of combined resistance and aerobic training(RT+AT) on regional BMD and physical function in persons living with HIV.The study participants consisted of 40 persons living with HIV (20 men and 20 women), who were randomized into the RT +AT group (n =20; age =38.3±4.9) or non-exercise control group (n =20; age =37.9±5.1).
Findings demonstrated that in the exercise group, there was a signiﬁcant increase in BMD at follow-up for the lumbar spine, femoral neck and 1/3 radius (a skeletal site comprising almost exclusively of cortical bone), 95and there were no gender differences in the training response between men andwomen in any of the BMD regions. Also, there were signi ﬁcant improvements in physical function (ie, handgrip strength and gait speed).94Even though the sample was relatively young compared to persons living with HIV ≥50 years, the research protocol, if needed, could be adapted to older HIV-positive individuals.
Like increased VAT, sarcopenia and low BMD, poor CRF is a major contributor to frailty and an obstacle to the health and well-being of aging persons living with HIV.96Data suggest that CRF has an essential role in reducing CVD and all-cause mortality, as well as incidents of myocardial infarction, hyper- tension, diabetes, atrial ﬁbrillation, heart failure, and stroke.97 Adults living with HIV have signi ﬁcantly reduced CRF, which exempli ﬁes the aging phenotype observed in adults with chronic HIV infection.98Enduring strategies for exercise training in older adults remain a challenge, with time andSmith 7 motivation as common obstacles. Although with similar or greater CRF gains, a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program relative to moderate-intensity continuous training may present a viable solution to a sustainable exerciseprogram given less time commitment and motivation among some aging persons living with HIV.
99HIIT is an aerobic exer- cise approach that involves periods of high-intensity anaerobicexercise (>85% of heart rate reserve —the difference between the maximum and resting heart rate) alternating with low- intensity continuous training. 100 As a cross-over pilot study, Briggs et al99explored the fea- sibility and effects of HIIT combined with RT on CRF in older adults living with HIV.The research was conductedwithin a randomized exercise trial with 26 sedentary adults with HIV, median age =61.5 (±6.7) years.Initially, partici- pants were randomized to 4 months of continuous high-intensity aerobic exercise (AEX) and RT (3x/week) or control group.Next, the control group completed 4 months of HIIT + RT (3x/week).The clinically signi ﬁcant increases in VO 2peak (the highest rate of oxygen that an individual can achieve during physical exertion) assessed during a graded treadmill test after HIIT and AEX represented improvements of 17.1%and 7.7%, respectively.
Both groups had improvements in exer- cise endurance and strength. Overall, the pilot study supported HIIT as a viable solution for delivering high-intensity AEX inimproving CRF towards the goal of strengthening cardiovascu- lar health in adults living with HIV.99 In general, the reviewed research suggests that engaging in a moderate to vigorous aerobic and resistance exercise program at least three times per week can improve body composition and CRF while potentially decreasing frailty in older individualsliving with HIV.
However, it is imperative to address all the barriers to initiating and maintaining an individualized exercise program, including physical and psychological decline, depres-sion, social in ﬂuences, reinforcement, lack of self-ef ﬁcacy, environmental context and resources, negative perceptions of gym culture, and appropriate exercises speci ﬁc to physical lim- itations —all ensuring that aging persons living with HIV will attain the bene ﬁts of a well-designed exercise program. 101,102 To further elevate the success of chronic exercise for older indi- viduals living with HIV and multimorbidity, a clinical exercise scientist or a medical exercise specialist should assess, pre- scribe, and monitor a tailored exercise program in clinical,behavioral health and home-based settings.Additional Lifestyle Factors Smoking Even though it is estimated that smoking causes one in every ﬁve deaths in the U.S.
each year, about one in ﬁve Americans still smoke cigarettes.103At about 40%, cigarette smoking is much higher among persons living with HIV,104and aging HIV-positive individuals are less likely to quit smoking than their age-matched uninfected counterparts.105Adults with HIV who smoke are more likely to be poor, homeless,previously incarcerated, depressed, and have lower educational attainment than those who do not smoke.104Persons living with HIV who smoke are also more likely to suffer from HIV-related infections, such as thrush, airy leukoplakia (white mouth sores),and bacterial and pneumocystis pneumonia. 106According to the available evidence, in HIV-positive individuals, smoking may lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heartdisease, stroke, and cancer.4,106Smoking has also been signi ﬁ- cantly implicated in treatment noncompliance in HIV-positive populations on ART.107 In sum, HIV-positive individuals who smoke will lose more life years to smoking than HIV.
Max and colleagues,108for example, explored deaths and projected deaths from smokingand HIV/AIDS among gay men in California from 2005 through 2050. The data indicated that from 2005 to 2014, smoking caused over 6800 deaths among gay and bisexualmen, while nearly 9500 died from HIV/AIDS.Mortality from both causes has been falling, but deaths from HIV/AIDS are falling more rapidly.Projections suggest that in the mid-2040s,more gay/bisexual men will d ie from smoking than from HIV/ AIDS.108With the synergism among aging, HIV, multimorbidity (ie, CVD) and smoking, life ’s trajectory shortens for aging persons living with HIV and multimorbidity; therefore, they should be encouraged to quit smoking.For this purpose, smokers should seek support via their healthcare provider or evidence-basedsmoking cessation programs, su ch as those accessible via the Internet.
Alcohol use HIV and alcohol abuse are linked to a wide range of comorbid-ities, many of which are typically associated with advanced aging, such as liver, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, andrenal diseases, as well as osteoporosis, cancer, metabolic alter- ations (ie, increased insulin resistance, decreased glucose toler- ance), T2D, and neurocognitive impairment. 109,110Alcohol abuse also leads to medication nonadherence, antiretroviral resistance, and risky sexual behaviors.111Overall, alcohol abuse among older persons living with HIV increases theodds of mortality.
112 Hazardous drinking is de ﬁned by the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption and is associated with acute and chronicmorbidity 113and binge drinking is categorized as four drinks for a woman and ﬁve drinks for a man over two hours.114 Comparatively, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is identi ﬁed as a medical condition characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences.115Crane and associates116investigated the prevalence of hazardous alcohol use among 8567 personsliving with HIV on ART, with a mean age =46 years, and 3441 (41%) were 50 years or older. Results demonstrated that hazardous alcohol use was reported by 27%, and 34% reportedbinge drinking.
Whereas based on the analysis of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study ’s (VACS) electronic record data made up of a sample of 32,699 adults living with HIV from urban and8 Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care large and small rural areas, the predicted prevalence of AUD was between 12 –14%.117 When considering alcohol abuse by older individuals living with HIV, the interrelationship between HIV, aging, andalcohol abuse should be viewed as a negative cumulative effect on immune function. 118A major link between alcohol, HIV, and immune function lies within the GI tract.As such,alcohol damages the mucosa lining of the intestines, resulting in in ﬂammation, barrier damage, and bacterial leakage, which, in turn, strengthens HIV ’s hold on the host.
118HIV infection has been shown to accelerate or accentuate immuno- senescence through chronic immune activation and persistent inﬂammation,119while chronic alcohol consumption may hasten immune activation and immunosenescence.85,120 Katz and colleagues120tested the hypothesis that hazardous alcohol consumption accelerates immune activation and immu-nosenescence in chronic binge al cohol (CBA)-consuming simian immunode ﬁciency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques with and without ART. Their results demonstrated that CD8 +T-cell activation and immunosenescence were increased relative to the baseline level only in CBA-consuming animals not receiv- ing ART.The researchers suggested that CBA consumptionand AUD enhance immune activation and immunosenescencein SIV-infected macaques and persons living with HIV.
120 Data published by Maffei et al85in a sample of 359 HIV-positive participants with a relatively h igh ART adherence, median age = 51 years, indicated that AUDIT scor es were positively associated with CD8+T-cell late differentiation, intestinal leakage and dysbiosis —and that alcohol-linked dys biosis was implicated in CD8+T-cell senescence. Comparatively, Carrieri et al121uncov- ered that individuals living with HIV on ART who consumed less than 10 grams of alcohol per day had a higher CD4+T-cell c o u n tw h e nc o m p a r e dt oa b s t a i n e r s, indicating that the adverse health consequences of alco hol use are dose-dependent.
Aging HIV-positive individuals may experience increased mortality and physiologic injury at lower levels of alcohol use compared with uninfected individuals.112In a sample of 18,145 persons living with HIV (76% of whom had undetect-able HIV-RNA; median age =52.5 years) and 42,228 unin- fected individuals (median age =54 years), Justice and colleagues 112explored the risk of (a) all-cause mortality and (b) physiological injury as measured by VACS Index (which is pred- icated on biomarkers such as age, CD4+T-cell count, viral load, hemoglobin, platelet c ount, creatinine). Speci ﬁc to HIV-positive individuals, ﬁndings indicated an Alcohol Use Disorder Identi ﬁcation Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) score ≥4a n d ≥30 drinks per month were associated with an increased mortalityrisk.Comparatively, AUDIT-C scores ≥5a n d ≥70 monthly drinks among uninfected indivi duals were associated with an increased mortality risk.
AUDIT-C threshold scores of 5 −7a n d 8 were associated with physiol ogical injury in persons living with HIV and uninfected particip ants, respectively. Guided by these disparities, the investigat ors concluded that alcohol limits for HIV-positive individuals should be lowered.112 Without question, excessive alcohol use can be harmful to the health and well-being of aging persons living with HIVand multimorbidity; thus, healthcare providers should periodi- cally assess hazardous drinking, AUD, and CBA consumption in this aging population and, if needed, provide appropriate interventions.Providers should also assess and deliversupport, if needed, for underlying psychosocial determinants (ie, depression, social isolation), which can precipitate or exac- erbate alcohol abuse.
Sexually Transmitted Infections Older HIV-positive persons have sex, and some engage in unprotected intercourse.122In a sample of 415 HIV-positive men (45 to 55 years of age at baseline) on ART, Surkan and col-leagues 123identi ﬁed that 66% (n =277) reported unprotected insertive anal intercourse, while 72% (n =299) reported unpro- tected anal receptive intercourse over six median follow-upvisits. In an earlier study, Golub et al 124explored the prevalence of different sexual behaviors in a sample of 914 older persons living with HIV aged >50 years (640 male, 264 female, 10 trans- gender) living in New York City.The ﬁndings indicated that over one-third of sexually active parti cipants reported unprotected anal or vaginal sex in the past three months, and 18% reported unpro-tected sex with serodiscordant partners.
Correlates with increased sexual-risk behaviors among aging persons living with HIV, as well as the general aging popula-tion, include a lack of knowledge concerning STIs, substance use, and psychosocial issues (ie, depression). 125,126Extant research has also shown several facets of syndemic relationships linkingSTIs and HIV.Particularly, people with STIs are more likely to become infected with HIV, and those coinfected with HIV and another STI are more likely to transmit HIV.
127Because of an aging immune system and accelerated or accentuated immunose- nescence linked to HIV,75,119further immunological downregula- tion may occur in older HIV-positive individuals on ART whencoinfected with another STI (ie, human papillomavirus) 128or other viruses (ie, cytomegalovirus),89,129thereby increasing the probability of multimor bidity and mortality.46,128 Developing risk-reduction programs for older persons living with HIV may be exceptionally challenging because of their age-related psychological, physical, or sexual stage of life.Nonetheless, they must understand the ease of transmission of other STIs and that, by practicing safer sex, they will protect themselves and their sexual partners against infections.Consequently, healthcare providers should periodically assess sexual-risk behaviors and be able to deliver appropriate safer-sex education as needed.
Insomnia Insomnia or sleep disturbance is characterized by dif ﬁculty ini- tiating and maintaining sleep.130Based on a meta-analysis, the estimated sleep disturbances in persons living with HIV is 58%,131compared to 10% to 30% in the general population.132 Although the pathophysiology of sleep disturbances in aging persons living with HIV and multimorbidity is unclear, it may be related to the ability of HIV to infect the central nervousSmith 9 system, polypharmacy, substance use (ie, excessive alcohol consumption), and morbidities (ie, depression, arthritis, digestive disease, renal and urologic diseases, cancer).131–136Regardless of its etiology, insomnia is clinically important in this population forseveral reasons, including the development and worsening of negative health outcomes that may be physical (ie, HTN, CVD, T2D, insulin resistance, central weight gain), cognitive (ie,slowed reaction time, poorer problem solving), emotional (ie, depression, inadequate emotional regulation), or immune- function related (ie, dysregulated innate immunity).
137–141 Empirical evidence focusing on aging HIV-positive persons with CVD risk is lacking, although data indicate that sleepdisturbance increases the ris k for CVD in the general aging population.142However, Polanka and colleagues143explored the HIV−CVD risk in a sample of HIV-infected veterans (n =3108; median age =49 years), with a median follow-up time of 10.8 years, during which 267 CVD events occurred. Relative to HIV-infected veterans with no dif ﬁculty falling or staying asleep, HIV-infected veterans bothered a lot by insomnia symptoms hadan increased risk of a CVD incident, suggesting that highly bother- some insomnia symptoms were signi ﬁcantly associated with CVD incidents in HIV-infected veterans.143 “Good sleep ”is imperative for the physical and psycholog- ical health and well-being of aging persons living with HIV and multimorbidity.
Healthcare providers should evaluate this agingpopulation ’s sleep quality regularly and identify and remedy any underlying problems (ie, depression and substance use) that may impede sleep quality. Importantly, providers shouldalso educate these patients on the importance of practicing good sleep hygiene, including (a) following a consistent sleep schedule, (b) avoiding caffeine and alcohol, (c) not consuminglarge meals too close to bedtime, and (d) exercising daily.
144 Treatment Adherence Viral replication and drug resistance increase in ART-nonad- herent individuals, increasing the chance of morbidities and mortality.145Heightened viral replication also results in higher viral load and infectiousne ss, enhancing the likelihood of transmitting the virus during unprotected sex.146Noncompliance with medications prescribed for coexisting conditions, such as HTN and dyslipidemia, may result in negative sequelae (eg, dys- lipidemia and HTN to CVD) as well as early death.147,148Older adults with HIV have a reduced risk for nonadherence toART than their younger counterparts. 149Treatment adher- ence, however, is challenging for aging persons living with HIV and multimorbidity due to several reasons, includingdecreased medication ef ﬁcacy associated with age-related physical deterioration, polypharmacy interactions and side effects, and cognitive decline.
32,150 –152 Prescribed psychotropics are frequently added to the poly- pharmacy burden of older adults as well as aging HIV-positive persons living with HIV and multimorbidity.153,154Yet, there is a de-escalation of the use of psychotropics because of their association with increased risk of geriatric syndromes, including falls, fractures, slow gait speed, and impairmentof neurocognitive function. 155–158Inappropriate prescribing of psychotropic medications to ol der patients, including aging HIV-positive persons, is present in institutionalized (ie, assisted living facilities and long-term care living facilities) and non- institutionalized populations.156,159Speci ﬁc to aging persons living with HIV, the use of mental health therapeutics, suchas antidepressants, may interact with ART, resulting in widened health consequences.
160In a review, Matt and Gaskill160explored the interaction between ART and antidepressants in older adultsand uncovered that during the early stage of HIV infection, the association increases virus replication and in ﬂammatory cytokine production. In the later stage, the interface couldTable 1.Positive Lifestyle Factors Improve the Health and Well- Being of Aging Persons Living with HIV and Multimorbidity.Positive lifestyle factors Bene ﬁts of positive lifestyle factors Decreased Depressive Symptoms and DepressionIncrease quality of life, cognition, smoking cessation, and treatment adherence.Decrease alcohol and substance use and risk of morbidity (ie, T2D,HTN).Positive Neuroplasticity aIncrease cognitive functioning (ie, visual attention, processing speed,semantic memory, perceptualspeed).

aPositive neuroplasticity refers to the nervous system ’s ability to develop connections between neurons (individual cells that make up the nervous system) in response to novel, stimulating, and challenging stimuli, which isassociated with education, physical activity, proper nutrition, adequate sleep, and cognitive remediation therapy (ie, playing a computerized game designed to improve visual attention and processing speed).
24 bVAT (visceral adipose tissue) is intra-abdominal fat surrounding internal organs.65 cFrailty represents a decreased physiological reserve and function that is more dominant with increasing age.4610 Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care precipitate neuropathy and create a Parkinson ’s-like state (ie, slowed movements, rigid muscles, impaired posture and balance) in sensitive individuals.160 Lastly, among aging persons living with HIV and multimor- bidity, there may be clustering and interaction of syndemic (or biopsychosocial) factors (ie, disease, poverty, substance use, depression),161,162which may adversely affect treatment com- pliance. Along with the clustering of biopsychosocial determi- nants, medication noncompliance is multifaceted for aging individuals living with HIV and multimorbidity.
It is incumbentupon healthcare providers to monito r treatment adherence closely and, whenever necessary, implement corrective actions to resolve noncompliance. Viable Solution Given the alarming ﬁndings reported in the preceding sections, the question is: “How do healthcare practitioners effectively address a multitude of negative lifestyle factors associated with numerous conditions faced by aging persons living with HIV while simultaneously deliveri ng high-quality, HIV-relatedmedical care?”In tackling the often integrated, interactive, and multilayered negative lifestyle factors confronted by older persons living with HIV and multimorbidity, the solution may lie in developing an interdisciplinary team or unit comprisedof preventive clinical practitioners.
The team could work in the community and medical (or clinical) settings and function as a roving unit to reach communities needing this vitalservice, and it may use telehealth services to support clients in receiving preventive care better. Importantly, the team ’s overarching goal will be to promote and implement positive lifestyle factors to improve the health and well-being speci ﬁc to the aging HIV-positive population; Tables 1 and 2 highlight the bene ﬁts of positive lifestyle factors.An interdisciplinary preventive-clinical team should be com- prised of clinicians with education, training, and experience in preventive and clinical care, with preferable knowledge aboutand expertise in working with older people living with HIV.Ultimately, the team must also be able to frame and deliver ser- vices within the context of primary, secondary, or tertiary preven-tion constructs.
164Primary prevention focuses on preventing disease,165whereas secondary prevention targets preclinical condi- tions or potential sequelae (eg, prehypertension to hyperten-sion), 166and tertiary prevention emphasizes managing an existing disease, focusing on condition improvement and non- worsening of the disease.167Disease prevention programs or services should ideally focus on delivering primary and second- ary preventions; however, given that older persons living with HIV present with one (ie, HIV disease) to multiple coexistingclinical condition(s), they would require tertiary prevention services. After forming an interdisciplinary team, all its members should undergo training.168,169The primary goal of training is to establish respectful and trusting interpersonal relationships among members, with the key understanding that everyonebrings unique knowledge and skills to the team, ensuring that high-quality and comprehensive services will be provided to each client.
The training should focus on (a) clearly de ﬁning the roles and responsibilities of each team member; (b) develop- ing an assessment plan, encompassing identifying and develop- ing instruments; (c) outlining what a client may experience (orclient protocol) during and following (follow-up) service; (d) timely and appropriate communication and exchange of infor- mation with a client; (e) developing a referral list of health-related resources (ie, foodbanks) and healthcare providers exter- nal to the team (ie, occupational and physical therapists); and (f) providing constructive feedback that will foster ef ﬁcient and effective information exchange between team members. Also, as part of the training, healthcare providers, such as geriatricians who have working knowledge and experience with agingHIV-positive individuals, will be consulted to ensure the team implements best practices.
Furthermore, a disease prevention network will be developed through possible referrals made toand received from specialists (ie, geriatricians), primary care providers (PCPs), psychiatrists, physical therapists, occupa- tional therapists, as well as other healthcare providers (ie, den-tists, ophthalmologists, optometrists, orthopedists).Table 2. Positive Lifestyle Factors Improve the Health and Well- Being of Aging Persons Living with HIV and Multimorbidity.Positive lifestyle factors Bene ﬁts of positive lifestyle factors Minimal Alcohol UseaDecrease risk of morbidity (ie, liver disease, CVD, T2D, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, renal disease,osteoporosis, neurocognitiveimpairment), medicationnoncompliance, ART resistance, unsafe sex, immune activation, in ﬂammation, and mortality.Safer Sex Practices Decrease transmitting HIV and coinfections (ie, gonorrhea, syphilis),and being coinfected with sexually transmitted viruses (ie, HPV).

aMinimal alcohol use is no more than 1 drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men.163Examples of 1 standard drink include 12 ﬂuid ounces of regular beer, containing about 5% alcohol; 5 ﬂuid ounces of wine, containing approximately 12% alcohol; and 1.5 ounces of spirit (ie, gin, whiskey), including about 40% alcohol.144 bVAT (visceral adipose tissue) is intra-abdominal fat surrounding internal organs.46Smith 11 A unit speci ﬁcally tasked with working with aging people living with HIV and multimorbidity could include a medical nutrition therapist (eg, clinical registered dietitian), clinical exercise scientist (eg, certi ﬁed clinical exercise physiologist or certi ﬁed medical exercise specialist), mental health therapist (eg, licensed clinical psychologist), pharmacist, client service coordinator (eg, clinical social worker or medical casemanager), and certi ﬁed health coach.
The primary role of a cer- tiﬁed health coach would be to empower the clients to transform their health via lifestyle and behavioral changes. Evidence indi-cates that substance use (ie, alcohol abuse) is implicated in the progression of HIV as well as in the development and worsen- ing of comorbid conditions (ie, T2D, osteoporosis, HTN,CVD) 37,110,170; therefore, at least one clinician should be certi- ﬁed as a substance abuse counselor.Figure 2 illustrates the pro- posed client-centered, preventive-cl inical, interdisciplinary-team practice model, where the client is in the center and surrounded by clinicians and social support (friends and family).As indicated by the model, the role that friends and family could play may be essential to a client ’s success in adopting pos- itive behavioral changes while acc omplishing desirable health out- comes.
For this reason, when appropriate, friends and familymembers should be engaged in the physical and psychological assessments, feedback , education, and training offered to clients. Members of the support system will be guided by respectiveteam members on how to encourage or support a client ’s behavio- ral change process, especially without judgment or criticism.Lastly, to support quality services, a strong relationship must be developed via electronic record keeping and information exchangewith healthcare providers extern al to the team, including PCPs, medical specialists (ie, geriatricia ns, cardiologists), psychiatrists, or physical therapists.The te am, for example, will exchange assessment results, treatment plan s, and follow-ups via electronic records with external healthcare providers.Conclusion It is important to note the limitations in the data reviewed.
For example, the exercise research consisted of small sample sizes, which in multiple instances did not control for diet as a possible confounding variable, especially when assessing fat and musclechanges. Irrespective of the review ’s limitations, the data provided insight into the psychological a nd physical struggles expressed through negative lifestyle fact ors that may be experienced by some aging HIV-positive adults with multimorbidity.Even though we are living in an era marked by an emphasis on preven- tive health, many older adults living with HIV are confronted witha unique set of challenges that may make it more dif ﬁcult to prevent and manage multimorbi dity relative to their aging HIV-negative counterparts.Speci ﬁcally, when the burden of Figure 2.Client-Centered preventive-clinical interdisciplinary-team practice model.
The client-centered, preventive-clinical, interdisciplinary-team practice model consists of a) the client as the center and b) the interdisciplinary team (ie, clinical client servicecoordinator, certi ﬁed health coach, pharmacist, clinical exercise specialist, medical nutrition therapist, mental health therapist plus social support including friends and family).12 Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care HIV is added to the physical and psychological decline, social and economic disparities, stigmatization and alienation (ie, based on sexual identity and race), and polypharmacy interactions and side effects, improving psychological and behavioral health andquality of life become increasingly more dif ﬁcult.
Within the context of preventive medicine, improving psy- chological and behavioral health in the aging HIV-positive pop-ulation requires greater focus on preventing and managing negative lifestyle factors such as poor mental health (ie, depres- sion and cognitive decline), suboptimal nutrition, physical inac-tivity, substance use (ie, smoking and alcohol use), STIs, sleep disturbance, and treatment nonadherence. However, many of the existing wellness programs in clinical- and community-based settings may be ill-equipped to address the negative life- style factors experienced by aging persons living with HIV and multimorbidity.The physical and psychological health andquality of life for older individuals living with HIV and multi- morbidity could be enhanced by developing a client-centered, preventive-clinical, interdisciplinary-team practice based onwell-recognized prevention constructs.
Lastly, grounded on a client-centered, preventive-clinical, interdisciplinary team model, longitudinal data collection and analysis should driveprogram effectiveness and modi ﬁcations.
