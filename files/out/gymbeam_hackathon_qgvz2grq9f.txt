MgSBC-0.1 caneffectively remove phosphate intheinitial solution pHrange of3.00–7.00, withafitted maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity of379.52 mg�g-1.The adsorption conforms tothepseudo second-order kinetics model andLangmuir isotherm adsorption curve. Thecharacteriza tionoftheadsorbed composite material revealed the contribution ofphosphorus crystal deposition andelectrostatic attraction tophosphorus absorption.Introduction Inrecent years, with theacceleration oftheindustrialization process, thescale ofsewage treat- ment plant (WWTPs) hasgradually increased, ashastheproduction ofsludge asaby-product ofWWTPs [1,2].Phosphorus insewage isthemain source ofexcessive phosphorus discharge inwater bodies.
Excessive discharge ofphosphorus containing wastewater canlead toeutro- phication ofsurface water, and sludge iscomposed oforganic matter, trace elements, microor- ganisms [3].and other toxic substances such aspathogens and heavy metals [4,5].Therefore, strengthening sludge treatment isofgreat significance inaddressing environmental pollution risks and phosphorus crises. The difference between sludge pyrolysis and traditional compost landfill liesinitsstrong stability, fastprocessing speed, and non-toxic product.This isoneof themost promising processes forhigh-value utilization ofbiomass [6].Most notably, thepro- duced sludge-based biochar canbeutilized asanadsorbent totreat fuel, phenols, and phenolic chemicals inwaste water since itisaporous material with enough surface functional groups [7,8],therefore, theuseofbiomass waste toproduce new low-cost green adsorbents hasgrad- ually attracted attention togreen development and carbon neutrality.

Data Availabilit yStatement: Allrelevant dataare within themanuscript anditsSupport ing Information files.Funding: Thisstudy wassupported byChu-Ya Wang from theNatural Science Foundation of substantial progress hasbeen made inthepreparation ofsludge-based biochar using sludge as rawmaterial through chemical modification.The adsorption capacity and efficiency ofunmodified BCarenothigh enough, and modifi- cation treatment isneeded.
The commonly used modification methods include electrochemi- calmodification, biomass pyrolysis, and bioaccumulation [9].The most typical way wasto alter biochar (BC) with metal ions using various methods such asprediction. The aluminum/ magnesium (Al/Mg) modified BCcanachieve aphosphate adsorption capacity of74.47 mg�g-1 byemploying anAlelectrode and aconcentrated Mgsolution astheelectrolyte [10].Other metals, such ascalcium (Ca) and Mg, arealso employed toincrease phosphate adsorption by BC.Before pyrolysis, BCrawmaterials canbemixed with materials rich inCaand Mgions, such asdolomite and montmorillonite.Mg/Ca modified biochar hasahigher capacity forMg and Padsorption [11, 12].When sugarcane straw biochar ischanged with Al,itmay adsorb phosphate upto758.96 mg�g-1;when modified with Mg/Al, itcanadsorb upto887mgP�g-1 [13].This isbecause Aland Mgcanaddnew adsorption sites and undergo chemical and physi- caladsorption simultaneously.
SBC hastheadvantage oflowcost and isoneofthebest adsorbents forphosphorus treat- ment inwastewater treatment plants [1].And SBC canbereused insewage treatment plants forphosphate orother pollutant adsorption treatment. However, there islimited research on theuseofSBC forPadsorption, possibly duetoitslowadsorption capacity forphosphate in wastewater, somodification ofSBC isnecessary.Atpresent, there aremodification methods such asinorganic salttreatment, inorganic acid-base treatment [14], activation [15], and other biomass impurities.Among them, metal impurity treatment isthemost widely used, such as Al,Fe,Lanthanum (La) and other impurities, butitcancause further pollution, and themodi- fication object isgenerally activated carbon orwooden biochar [10, 16,17].According to reports inrecent years, adsorbents treated with Mgsalts exhibit strong phosphate activity and affinity, potentially enhancing their adsorption capability [18–20].
However, theeffectiveness ofMgsaltmodified sludge-based biochar inadsorbing phosphate isstillunclear, and there is also limited research onthedesorption mechanism and release characteristics ofphosphate. Inthisstudy, aseries ofsludge-based biochar material with different Mg-loading-modifica- tion were synthesized byimpregnation method.The morphology, pore structure, surface chemical state, and distribution and existing form ofMgintheprepared Mg-loaded sludge- based biochar were comprehensively characterized.Determine themechanism forcontrolling phosphorus adsorption and measure theadsorption characteristics ofsludge-based biochar on phosphorus through kinetics and isothermal adsorption experiments.Additionally, studies on theimpact ofcoexisting ions ontheadsorption ofphosphate onsludge-based biochar helped toclarify themolecular mechanism ofthegenerated material’s enhancement ofphosphorus adsorption.
More importantly, theeffectiveness and repeatability ofphosphorus recovery had been confirmed, which showed great potential forthepractical application ofthese as-pre- pared sludge-biochar. Materials andmethod Preparation ofsludge-biochar Anaerobic fermentation sludge from thesludge process served astherawmaterial forthepro- duction ofbiochar.The sludge wasdried ina105˚C oven toreduce water tolessthan 1%, ground to200mesh.A0.1mol�L-1Mg(CH 3COO) 2solution wasprepared, from which a100mLsample was taken inabaker, and 2gsludge powder (SP) wasadded.

Prepare aphosphate solution (1000 mg�L-1)from theassessed and graded potassium dihydrogen phosphate (K2HPO 4)indeionized water and dilute ittotheappropriate concen- tration forfurther batch studies. Batch adsorption experiments Tobetter understand theadsorbing effect ofbiochar onphosphates, KH 2PO 4waschosen to represent inorganic phosphate.The bath adsorption method wasused toexamine theeffects ofinitial pH, initial concentra- tion ofthephosphate solution, amount ofadsorbent employed, and contact time.The dosage ofadsorbent wasfixed at0.67 g�L-1.Forthecontact time test, thesolution-filled vialwas shaken at300rpm foronetoseventy-two minutes atroom temperature.
Calculate theamount ofphosphate adsorbed atthat time using Eq(1): Qt¼V MðC0 CtÞ ð1Þ WhereQtrefers totheamount ofphosphorus adsorbed byeach unit ofadsorbent attime t.Where C0(mg�L-1)represents theinitial phosphorus concentration, Ct(mg�L-1)represents thephosphorus concentration attime t,and(C0-Ct)refers tothechange ofphosphorus concentration. The mass of theadsorbent andthevolume ofthesolution arerepresented byMandV,respectively.Without pHadjustment, thepHvalue of100mgL-1KH 2PO 4solution isaround 5.60.Using thesame method asthecontact time test, butwith different dosages.0.67 g�L-1ofadsor- bent wasused totesttheadsorbent dose study.The first pHinvestigation wasthen carried out byadjusting theinitial pHvalues ofthephosphate solution from 3to11using HCl orNaOH.

The BET adsorption and desorption curves offour materials are shown inFig2A.Interms ofBET surface area (cm2�g-1)and pore volume (cm3�g-1),SBC had values of17.76 and 0.037, while MgSBC-0.1 hadvalues of93.35 and 0.17. The surface area and pores ofSBC were substantially lessthan those ofMgSBC-0.1, according tothisresult.The var- iations inparticular surface area matched thefindings oftheSEM.Moreover, theaverage pore size(APD) ofSP,SBC, MgSP-0.1, and MgSBC-0.1 were 12.92, 10.27, 4.19, and 6.3860 nm, respectively.During themodification process, theaverage pore sizes ofSP,SBC, and MgSBC- 0.1were stillbetween 2–50 nm, allbelonging tomesopores.However, itmay beduetothe blockage ofsome pores byMgO impregnated biochar and thehigh calcination temperature, causing some pores ofMgSBC-0.1 tocollapse during thepreparation process, resulting ina lower APD.
The findings showed that biochar’s pore shape and surface area could bemodified bycalcination and Mg-loading, which hadanimpact onthematerial’s ability toadsorb and desorb substances. According totheIUPAC classification, theN2adsorption curves ofSP, SBC, and MgSBC-0.1 showed type IVadsorption isotherms, accompanied byH3hysteresis loops.This behavior could beattributed tothepresence ofmesopores formed through the aggregation ofplate-like particles.The materials SP,SBC, MgSP-0.1, and MgSBC-0.1 alldis- played vertical adsorption branches characterized byrelative pressures inproximity tounity.Both SBC and MgSBC-0.1 samples displayed hysteresis loops characterized byvertical desorp- tion branches atarelative pressure ofaround 0.5.The hysteresis loop seen inthisstudy was produced bypores that were slit-shaped, including thin, short, and parallel openings [21].Fig 2Bshows theXRD patterns ofthecrystal structures ofSP,SBC, and MgSBC-0.1.
The results indicated that thepeaks corresponding tothecrystals present inbiochar were matched with SiO 2(PDF #85–0798) and MgO (PDF #45–0946). The diffraction peaks obtained at2θ= 36.86˚ (111), 42.83˚ (200), 62.30˚ (220), 74.69˚ (311), and 78.63˚ (222) match MgO, while the diffraction peaks obtained at2θ=20.86˚ (100), 26.64˚ (011), 36.54˚ (110), 39.47˚ (102), and 50.14˚ (11–2) match SiO 2.Itcould beseen that SPwasmainly composed ofsilicon dioxide (SiO 2).Calcination increased thepeak strength ofSiO 2inbiochar.Inaddition, thepeak inten- sityofSiO 2inMgSBC-0.1 waslower than that ofunmodified biochar.However, aMgO dif- fraction peak appeared intheXRD spectrum ofMgSBC-0.1, with thestrongest peak occurring at2θ=42.83˚, indicating thepresence ofalarge amount ofMgO intheprepared biochar after impregnation and calcination, which wasalso confirmed byother techniques (XPS and TEM) [22].
The method ofsurface semi-quantitative elemental analysis X-ray photoelectron spectros- copy (XPS) wasemployed toinvestigate theelemental composition (Fig 2C). Based ontheXPS analysis outcomes presented inTable 1,thesurface composition ofSPisfound toconsist of carbon (C), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), silicon (Si), Ca,and iron (Fe).The presence ofMgin MgSBC-0.1 suggested thesuccessful loading ofMgonto thebiochar material.The surface semi quantitative elemental analysis method XPS wasused toanalyze theelemental composition.According totheXPS characterization results inTable 1,thesurface ofSPcontains C,O,N,Si, Ca,and Fe.And MgSBC-0.1 contained Mg, indicating that Mghadbeen successfully loaded onto biochar.The O/C ratios ofSPand MgSBC-0.1 were determined tobe0.50 and 1.49, respectively, through calculation.The O/C ratio served asanindirect measure oftheoverall concentration ofsurface groups containing oxygen.
This implied that thecumulative concen- tration ofoxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) onthesurface. The electrical conduc- tivity ofMgSBC-0.1 wasalmost three times greater than that ofSP.The OFG present on PLOS ONEAdsorpt ionofphosphat eover anovel magnesium -loaded sludge-based biochar PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03019 86April 16,2024 5/19 PLOS ONEAdsorpt ionofphosphat eover anovel magnesium -loaded sludge-based biochar PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03019 86April 16,2024 6/19 biochar played acrucial role asactive sites intheprocess ofremoving pollutants from water, mostly byinterfacial adsorption and redox reactions.This phenomenon held potential benefits fortheremoval ofphosphates from water sources [23].The distribution ofFeelements within theMgSBC-0.1 material wasobserved tooccur at various depths, rather than restricting solely tothesurface.
During theprocess ofadsorption, theinternal iron element underwent dissolution inthesolution, subsequently forming acom- pound with Pand precipitating onto thesurface. This interaction enhanced theadsorption of phosphorus [24].The chemical reaction between theCapresented inthesludge and phosphate could enhance theadsorption capacity ofMgSBC-0.1 [25].The micro morphology ofSP,SBC, MgSBC-0.1 isvisualized byTEM images (Fig 3A–3D).SPand SBC have noobvious pore structure at500nm, butthemorphology ofmgsbc-0.1 was different from this.Itcanbeclearly seen from Fig3Dthat MgSBC-0.1 produces more pores, indicating that more active sites may beexposed onthesurface.The HRTEM image at5nm shows thedspacing between crystal planes of0.209 nm(Fig 3E), corresponding to(200) of MgO, which may indicate that MgO isloaded onthesurface ofbiochar, butitneeds further verification.The element distribution inthemapping diagram ofEDS further confirmed the element distribution inMgSBC-0.1.
Asshown inFig3F–3I, Mg, Oand Sielements arewell dispersed inthewhole particle. Fig4illustrates theFTIR spectra ofSP,SBC, and MgSBC-0.1 within thewavenumber range of4000–400 cm−1.The common deformation vibration absorption peaks ofSP,SBC, and MgSBC-0.1 were 802, 1086, 1624, 2918 and 3427 cm-1,respectively.The observed peaks inthe vibrational absorption spectra could beattributed tovarious molecular vibrations.Specifically, thepeaks corresponded tothedeformation vibrations ofaromatic compound C-H bonds, the stretching vibrations ofC-O bonds, thesymmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations ofali- phatic orcycloalkane -CH 3and -CH 2groups, and thestretching vibrations of-OH groups in intermolecular hydrogen bonded alcohols and phenols [26, 27].This observation suggested that thefundamental characteristics ofbiochar remained mostly unchanged during the MgSBC-0.1 alteration procedure.
Furthermore, itwasobserved that MgSBC-0.1 exhibited vibrations atawavenumber of3745 cm-1,indicating acorrelation with theformation ofMg- OH bonds. This finding suggested that thepresence ofbiochar resulted intheproduction of Mg(OH) 2,which enhanced theadsorption ofphosphate.Phosphate adsorption isotherm and kinetics Using a100mg�L-1Psolution, 2gofsludge powder wasimmersed in0.01, 0.05, 0.1,and 0.2 mol ofMgacetate solution (named MgSBC-0.01, MgSBC-0.05, MgSBC-0.1, and MgSBC-0.2) tocompare theadsorption performance offour different Mg-loaded sludge-based biochar materials forphosphate.According tothefindings presented inFig5,itisevident that theFig2.(a)N2adsorptio nand desorption curve, (b)XRD patterns ofSP,SBC and MgSBC-0 .1and(c)XPS spectra of SP,SBC, and MgSBC-0 .1.https://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0301986.g0 02 Table 1.Elemental composition (Atomic% )and oxygen carbon atomic ratio ofSP,SBC, P-MgSBC -0.1 and Des-MgSBC -0.1 estimated byX-ray photoelect ron spec- troscopy (XPS).

Moreover, theintroduction ofMgoxide/hydroxide loading further enhanced theadsorption efficacy ofsludge carbon inrelation tophosphorus.The adsorption capacity ofsludge-based biochar forPinitially increased and then reached astate ofprogres- sive stabilization astheloading ofMgincreases.Atthispoint, theadsorption capacity reached approximately 140mg�g-1,suggesting that there existed aspecific threshold fortheloading capacity ofsludge powder.
Inorder todelve deeper into theprocess ofphosphorus removal, anadsorption isotherm wasgenerated with MgSBC-0.1. Toenhance comprehension oftheadsorption characteristics ofMgSBC-0.1 onphosphate, theexperimental isotherm wassimulated using theLangmuir and Freundlich isotherm equa- tions, asshown below.Qe¼QmaxKLCe=ð1þKLCeÞ ð4Þ Qe¼KfC1=m e ð5Þ whereQmaxisthemaximum adsorption capacity oftheadsorbent (mg�g-1),KF[mg (g�(L�mg- 1)1/n)-1]andKL(Lmg-1)areconstants oftheFreundlich and Langmuir model equations, respectively.The observed trend inFig6Aand 6Bindicates that thephosphate adsorption capacity exhibited asubstantial risewith therising concentration ofphosphoric acid, eventu- allyreaching astate ofequilibrium.The results offitting theexperimental data indicated that theLangmuir model and Freundlich model achieved R2values of0.94 and 0.85, respectively, Fig3.(a-c) TEM images (500nm) ofSP,SBC and MgSBC-0 .1,(d-e) TEM images ofMgSBC-0 .1,(f-i) Elemental mapping ofMgSBC-0 .1.

This adsorption process wasdetermined tobeamonolayer adsorption.Furthermore, thephenome- non could beelucidated bytheprocess ofphosphate undergoing surface crystallization to form Mgcompounds [24, 28,29].The Langmuir model wasutilized todetermine themaximal phosphate adsorption capacity, yielding avalue of379.52 mg�g-1.Incomparison tounaltered biochar, which exhibited anadsorption capacity of52.95 mg�g-1(S1Fig), MgSBC-0.1 substan- tially increased itsphosphate adsorption capacity by7.17 times.However, thesurface area of MgSBC-0.1 increased by5.57 times higher than that ofSBC.
Hence, thenotable increase in phosphate adsorption capacity could beascribed tothechemical adsorption process facilitated bythepresence ofMgO onthebiochar surface. Butobviously, theincrease inspecific surface area isnottheonly factor causing theincrease inadsorption capacity ofMgSBC-0.1.Tofacilitate amore comprehensive examination oftheadsorption characteristics of MgSBC-0.1 onphosphate, various kinetic models including pseudo first order, pseudo second order, and intra-particle diffusion models were employed foranalysis.Fig6Cillustrates the adsorption capability ofMgSBC-0.1 forP.The MgSBC-0.1 material exhibited aphosphate cap- ture efficiency ofalmost 70mg�g-1within a15min timeframe.Equilibrium wasachieved in roughly 2h,with theadsorption capacity being stable ataround 150mg�g-1.The rapid capture Fig4.FTIR spectra ofSP,SBC, and MgSBC-0.1 .

ForSBC,ki1(5.35) wasalso greater thanki2(0.61), indicating that theadsorption ofphosphate bysludge-based biochar before and after modifica- tion isdetermined byexternal diffusion (S2B Fig). Theki1ofMgSBC-0.1 wasgreater thanki1 ofSBC, indicating that enhanced external diffusion contributes more totheimprovement of phosphate adsorption capacity [31].Effect ofdifferent factors onphosphate capture According tothedata presented inFig7,itcanbeobserved that theadsorption capacity of MgSBC-0.1 forphosphate remains relatively constant within thepHrange of3–6.The maxi- mum adsorption capacity recorded isaround 140mg�g-1.Inthespecified pHrange, thephos- phate inthesolution wasmostly intheH2PO 4-form, leading totheprecipitation ofthe liberated Mg2+and subsequent formation ofMgH 2PO 4crystals.Furthermore, itwasobserved that theadsorption capacity forphosphorus reached amaximum value of146mg�g-1atapH level of5.00.
When thepHvalue ofthesolution exceeded 6and continues toincrease, the adsorption capacity forphosphorus gradually decreased. AtapHvalue of11,theadsorption capacity ofphosphorus exhibited asubstantial decline, reaching 46.66 mg�g-1.This decrease amounted toareduction of68.04% incomparison totheadsorption capacity seen atpH5.00.The predominant phosphate species found inthesolution were themonovalent H2PO 4-ion (pK 1=2.15) atpHvalues below 7.20, thedivalent HPO 42-anion (pK 2=7.20) atpH7.20, and thetrivalent PO 43-anion atpHvalues above 12.33 [32, 33].The above findings indicated that when thepHapproached 7.00, asubstantial increase innegative surface charge and thepres- ence ofpolyvalent phosphorus oxide anions contributed totheenhancement ofelectrostatic repulsion [34].Given thetypical pHlevel ofapproximately 7inwastewater, itcould beinferred that theutilization ofMgSBC-0.1 wasappropriate forthepurpose ofphosphorus recovery from wastewater.
Furthermore, thisapproach haddemonstrated favorable outcomes interms ofadsorption treatment efficacy. The composition ofwastewater wascomplex, and theadsorption capacity ofMgSBC-0.1 forphosphate wasaffected byvarious coexisting ions inthewastewater Therefore, theimpact ofvarious cations, such asCa2+,Fe3+,and NH 4+,and anions, such asNO 3−,Cl−,SO 42−,CO 32−, and HCO 3−,onthephosphate adsorptive removal byMgSBC-0.1 were studied.Moreover, humic acid (HA), acommon organic matter inwastewater, wasalso animportant factor affect- ingtheadsorption ofphosphate byMgSBC-0.1 and needs tobestudied.Asisshown inFig8A, thecoexistence ofthese fiveanions hasvarying degrees ofimpact ontheperformance of MgSBC-0.1 inorder ofHCO 3->CO 32->SO 42->Cl->NO 3-.Among these fiveanions, HCO 3- and CO 32-hadthegreatest competitive effect onphosphate duetotheir competitive binding sites with phosphate [34].
When theconcentrations ofanions were 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1mmol�L- 1,theinclusion ofCl-,NO 3-,and SO 42-ions hadnosubstantial impact ontheadsorptionTable 3.Isothermal adsorption model parameters ofMgSBC-0.1 at298, 308, and 318 K,respectively .

This observation provided evidence that anions such asCl-,NO 3−and SO 42−were unable to undergo precipitation with Mg2+.Instead, they tended toform outer-sphere surface com- plexes, resulting inminimal impact onthesorption ofphosphate [11, 22,32]. The relationship between thelevels ofCO 32-and HCO 3-and their adsorption ability forphosphate was observed.When thequantities ofCO 32-and HCO 3-were increased from 0.01 to0.10 mmol�L- Fig7.The effect ofinitial pHonphosphate capture.https://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0301986.g0 07 Fig8.(a)The effect ofcoexist inganions onphosphate capture and (b)theeffect ofcoexist ingcations and gumic acids onphosphat ecapture.

The negative effect ofCO 32- and HCO 3-wasduetotheir reaction with Mg(II), and theformation ofprecipitates reduced theadsorption ofphosphate active sites byMgSBC-0.1.The adsorption capacity ofMgSBC-0.1 forphosphate wasdiminished inthepresence ofHA.This could beattributed tothecompeti- tiveinteraction between functional groups ofHA, such ascarboxylic acid, carbonyl group, and phenolic hydroxyl group, and Pforbinding receptors onMgO and other oxides.Conse- quently, theadsorption capacity experienced adecline [35].
The promotional effect ofthethree cations ontheadsorption ofphosphate byMgSBC-0.1 isevident from theobservation ofFig8B,ascompared tothecontrol group. The adsorption capacity ofMgSBC-0.1 forphosphate ions exhibited asteady increase astheionconcentration increased.ForNH 4+ions, thedissolved MgO and Mg(OH) 2onthesurface ofMgSBC-0.1 may precipitate with NH 4+topromote phosphate adsorption.Therefore, inwater with apHof approximately 7,thefollowing reactions might occur onthesurface ofthecomposite material [36].MgOþH2O!MgðOHÞ2!Mg2þþ2OH ð9Þ Mg2þþHPO2  4þNHþ 4þ6H2O!MgNH4PO4�6H2OðsÞ ð10Þ The presence ofCa2+and Fe3+ions wasfound toenhance theadsorption ofphosphate by MgSBC-0.1.This could beattributed totheinvolvement ofCa(particularly free CaO and CaSO 4)and iron (specifically Fe2O3)astheprimary components responsible forphosphate fix- ation.
The phosphate fixation ofCacomponents wasformed byprecipitation ofCaphosphate toform CaHPO 4�2H 2O,while thephosphate fixation ofiron components wasformed by ligand exchange orelectrostatic attraction toform acoprecipitation ofphosphate ions and iron oxide [37]. XPS characterization showed that MgSBC-0.1 itself contains Caand Fe,which wasconducive totheremoval ofphosphate inwastewater [38].Toinvestigate theefficacy ofMgSBC-0.1 inremoving phosphorus from realwastewater, adsorption tests were performed utilizing rural biogas slurry asthesource water.The total phosphorus concentration and pHvalue ofthebiogas slurry were 26.92±2.00�mgP�L-1,and 8.82±0.01�mgP�L-1,respectively.Subsequently, upon increasing thedosage ofMgSBC-0.1 from 0.33 g�L-1to4.00�g�L-1,there wasobserved anascending pattern intheremoval rate of total phosphorus inside thebiogas slurry.This rate exhibited anincrement from 33.38% to 87.38%.
ButforSBC, theremoval rate ofphosphate only increased from 18.58% to52.71%, much lower than MgSBC-0.1 (S3Fig). The residual concentrations oftotal phosphorus inthe solution decreased from 6.78 to1.82�mgP�L-1.Upon reaching aconcentration of2.00�g�L-1,the adsorbent demonstrated astable removal rate ofapproximately 87.20%.This indicated that for MgSBC-0.1, 2.00�g�L-1wastheoptimal solid-liquid ratio fortreating actual biogas slurry, and biochar modified with magnesium loading hadbetter treatment effect onactual biogas slurry.Mechanism ofPcapture The primary constituents ofthebiochar derived from sludge, asinvestigated inthiswork, con- sisted predominantly ofMg(OH) 2and MgO.Additionally, thesludge material itself was found tocontain theelement Ca.Hence, thePand adsorption mechanism exhibited distinct characteristics incomparison toother investigations.
The XRD pattern (Fig 9A) shows that theMgO characteristic peak ofMgSBC-0.1 wasalso weakened and theMgHPO 4�3H 2Ocharacteristic peak appeared after adsorption ofphosphate, which also indicated theoccurrence ofthereaction. Togain deeper insights into the PLOS ONEAdsorpt ionofphosphat eover anovel magnesium -loaded sludge-based biochar PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03019 86April 16,2024 14/19 adsorption mechanism, theXPS spectrum revealed asubstantial reduction inthePcontent in MgSBC-0.1, asindicated inTable 1.Furthermore, asubstantial quantity ofPwasseen follow- ingtheadsorption ofphosphate byMgSBC-0.1.This finding further supported thenotion that MgSBC-0.1 hadahigh affinity forphosphate capture.The XRD spectra ofbiochar (loaded with P)revealed prominent indications ofpre-existing MgO.Additionally, thespectra exhib- ited thepresence ofnewly formed Mg-P and Ca-P crystals, namely intheform ofMgHPO 4, and CaHPO 4(Fig 9A).
Inconjunction with thepreviously documented surface deposition mechanism ofMg-loaded biochar onP.Itwasworth noting that theCareleased from sludge- based biochar might also exert asubstantial influence ontheprecipitation ofphosphorus from aqueous solutions [39]. The confirmation ofPprecipitation onbiochar wasadditionally verified viaXPS analysis, asdepicted inFig9B.The spectrum ofMg1s(Fig 9C)revealed theexistence ofMgO and Mg (OH) 2compounds onthesurface ofphosphorus-loaded biochar prior toadsorption.Con- versely, thespectrum ofP2p(Fig 9D) demonstrated thepresence ofMgHPO 4compounds on thesurface ofP-loaded biochar following adsorption.Despite thelowsolubility ofboth MgO and Mg(OH) 2,theintroduction ofPanions inthesolution potentially enhanced their dissolu- tion, resulting intheformation ofmore insoluble Psalt, such asMgHPO 4.The pHvalues ofthesolutions were measured prior toand after adsorption.
Itwasobserved that theinitial pHvalue forallsolutions wasapproximately 5.70, while thefinal pHvalue was around 7.40. These findings align with theprecipitation mechanism.Inthespecified pH range, thephosphate present inthesolution wasshown toexist asHPO 4-and H2PO 4-ions.Fig9.(a)XRD spectru mofP-MgSBC- 0.1biochar, (b)XPS spectra ofMgSBC -0.1, P-SBC, and P-MgSBC- 0.1,(c)XPS spectra ofMg1sbefore utilization and (d)after utilization phospha teadsorptio nofMgSBC -0.1, respective ly.https://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0301986.g0 09 PLOS ONEAdsorpt ionofphosphat eover anovel magnesium -loaded sludge-based biochar PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03019 86April 16,2024 15/19 Consequently, thereleased Mgand Caions underwent precipitation, resulting intheforma- tion ofMgHPO 4and CaHPO 4crystals.
Inthepresence ofacidic orneutral conditions, thefor- mation ofouter surface complex equations between HPO 42-and Mgand Casurfaces occurred when OH- groups were present onthematerial’s surface. The equations could beexpressed as follows [40, 41], MgOþH2O!Mg2þþ2OH ð11Þ MgOþH2O!MgOHþþOH ð12Þ MgOHþþHPO2  4!MgOHþ���HPO2  4 ð13Þ Mg2þþHPO2  4!MgHPO4 ð14Þ Ca OHþHþ!¼Ca OHþ 2 ð15Þ Ca OHþ 2þH2PO  4=HPO2  4!Ca OHþ 2   H2PO  4=HPO2  4ð16Þ Recovery ofphosphate Toexplore thedesorption mechanism ofphosphoric acid, Des-MgSBC-0.1 wascharacterized using XPS (Fig 9B)and FTIR (S4Fig).The XPS spectrum showed that theP2Ppeak 360disap- pears substantially after alkali immersion, indicating phosphate desorption.The P2Ppeak dis- appeared, and thebinding energy ofMg1speak returns toalevel equivalent toMgSBC-0.1, indicating thechemical bond cleavage between Mg2+and HPO 42-.And intheFTIR spectrum, theP-O characteristic peak ataround 577cm-1after desorption almost disappeared.
The above results indicated that thealkaline solution could quickly desorb thephosphorus adsorbed onMgSBC-0.1. The reusability ofMgSBC-0.1 isshown inS5Fig.The adsorption efficiency ofMgSBC-0.1 forphosphorus exhibited asubstantial decline asthenumber ofadsorption desorption cycles increased.Specifically, theefficiency declined from 92.52% intheinitial cycle to69.22% inthe subsequent cycle, and further decreased to59.48% after thethird cycle.The results indicated that theadsorption and reusability ofMgSBC-0.1 forphosphorus waslimited.Conclusion MgSBC-0.1 wasprepared byimpregnating sludge powder with Mgacetate and pyrolysis at 500˚C.The increase inspecific surface area ofMgSBC-0.1 and theMg-loading-modification enhance itsability torecover phosphate from aqueous solutions.The adsorption ofphosphate byMgSBC-0.1 follows theLangmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model, with a maximum adsorption capacity of379.52 mg�g-1,which is7.17 times higher that ofSBC.
In addition, common anions (SO 42-,NO 3-,and Cl-)have nosubstantial inhibitory effect onthe adsorption ofphosphate ions byMgSBC-0.1, while CO 32-and HCO 3-have asubstantial inhibi- tory effect. The easily generated cations (Fe3+,NH 4+,and Ca2+)inwastewater allpromote the adsorption ofphosphate byMgSBC-0.1.The method ofspontaneous capture ofphosphate involves traditional three-step hydrolysis mechanisms, particularly electrostatic attraction and chemical precipitation.During thisprocess, theadsorbed Pmainly exists intheform of MgHPO 4and CaHPO 4.The improvement ofadsorption capacity isfundamentally duetothe transformation ofthemain adsorption form from physical adsorption tochemical adsorption.PLOS ONEAdsorpt ionofphosphat eover anovel magnesium -loaded sludge-based biochar PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03019 86April 16,2024 16/19 Supporting information S1Fig.Fitting ofphosphate adsorption isotherms forSBC at318K.(TIF) S2Fig.
