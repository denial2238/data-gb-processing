Tis study evaluated the physicochemical properties of ginger coated with chitosan and beeswax during storage for 6months at diferent temperatures (18°C and 25°C). Fresh ginger was treated with chitosancoating(1.5and3.5%),followedbybeeswaxcoating(3and6%).Tecoatedgingerwaswrappedinaplasticnetandstored at ambient (25°C) and low temperatures (18°C) for six months.Te results confrmed that coating treatment slowed down the changes in physicochemical properties (moisture, phenolic content, and so on) of ginger during storage.Ginger stored at 25°C showed shorter shelf lives than those stored at 18°C.
Coating ginger with 3% chitosan followed by 6% beeswax exhibited the best results in maintaining the moisture and phenolic content, reducing weight loss, and increasing total soluble solid (TSS) and cellcompartmentsizeforsixmonthsofstorage.Tisstudyprovidesapromisingapproachtodelayingthespoilageoffreshgingerby applying coating treatments useful for developing handling protocols for fresh ginger during storage and distribution. 1.Introduction Ginger (Zingiber ofcinale Roscoe) is an essential medicinal andspiceherbwithmanyhealthbenefts.Itiswidelyusedas a food ingredient, seasoning, supplement, and favouringandhasbenefcialcharacteristicssuchasaspicytaste,aroma,nutrition, and pharmacological activity [1].Due to its highmoisturecontentandsusceptibilitytomicrobialattack,freshginger spoils quickly.
Inappropriate storage conditions can reduce the quality of fresh ginger, characterised by drying loss,senescence,andputrefaction[2].Teprimarycausesofspoilage are improper postharvest handling, the growth ofspoilage microbes, the action of naturally existing enzymes,chemical reactions, and structural changes during storage[3]. Fresh ginger is generally preserved using modifed andcontrolled atmosphere packaging, chemical treatments suchas colour fxing agents or inorganic salts, low temperature,and edible coatings, all of which are similarly used forfruit and vegetable preservation [4].Furthermore, manyeco-friendly postharvest treatments have been utilized forpreservation of vegetables and fruits as well as stress re-duction, including chitosan, oligochitosan [5], eugenol [6],humic acid, and methyl jasmonate [7, 8].Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide made up of glu- cosamine and N-acetylglucosamine, connected by β-1,4- glycosidic linkages.
It is obtained by partial deacetylation ofchitin. Te main distinction between chitin and chitosan isthe proportion of acetyl groups in their chemical structures [9].It is frequently utilized as a material to produce bio- degradable flms and microbe-resistant food preservatives.Te presence of positively charged amine groups in thepolymerstructurehasantibacterialproperties.Chitosanaidsin the preservation of fruits and vegetables by acting asa barrier to moisture, O 2, and CO 2[9].Chitosan and oli- gochitosan can suppress the rotting of ginger rhizomesduring storage because they can increase the activity ofdefence enzymes in ginger [5].When applied to plants,chitosan exhibits three activities: (i) elicitation of hostWiley Scientifica Volume 2024, Article ID 2054943, 8 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/2054943 defences, (ii) antimicrobial action, and (iii) formation of flms on the treated surface [10].Another potential coating material is beeswax.
Beeswax coating can maintain the moisture content and quality ofrhizomes. Waxes are esters of long-chain unsaturated fattyacids with long-chain monohydrate alcohols or sterols [11].Tebeeswaxcoatingstudy,whichincludedacombinationof 4% beeswax coating with the addition of paclobutrazol(1,500ppm),wasabletosuppressafairlylargepercentageofwhite ginger rhizome sprouts when stored at a temperatureof 20–22 °C for three months [12].Te diferent storage facilities have reportedly impacted physicochemical prop-erties such as pH, total soluble solid (TSS), total solid (TS),acidity, and water activity [3].Polysaccharides and proteins are outstanding materials to form coatings and flms, displaying extraordinary me-chanical properties.However, they have a limited barrier against moisture transfer.Tis limitation does not apply to lipids with high melting points, such as beeswax and car-nauba wax [13].
Lipid-based compounds have been widelyused as coating formers that efectively reduce loss of waterand fruit surface erosion, enhance mechanical rigidity, andcontrol inner gas composition [14]. Coatings can be formulated using either a single com- pound or a combination of compounds using the layer-by-layer method, producing a multilayer coating with highreliability under varied environmental stresses [15].A bi-layer coating that combines chitosan with carnauba waxhasbeen tested on strawberries and demonstrated positive ef- fects in conserving frmness and reducing weight loss [9].Other research suggested that coating blueberry fruits withchitosan and aloe vera efectively reduced mold contami-nation and water loss compared to uncoated fruits [16].Storage is an important stage in postharvest ginger, as proper storage ensures that its quality is maintained fora long period of time.Cold storage is recommended as itsignifcantly extends the shelf life of the commodity.
Teoptimal storage conditions for fresh ginger are 13– 15 °C with a relative humidity of 90–95% [17]. Casimero et al.[18]suggestthattheappropriatetemperatureandrelative humidity for storing fresh ginger are 12 °C and RH 75%.Terefore, the availability of cold storage facilities is es- sential to preserve the quality of ginger.However, theimplementation of cold storage is prohibitively expensivefor most ginger producers, particularly small-scalefarmers, due to the required postharvest infrastructureand facilities.Consequently, this research proposes theutilization of moderate temperatures (around 18 °C) achievable through more afordable air conditioning(AC), providing a feasible alternative compared to coldstorage.
Fresh ginger will be negatively afected when the storagetemperatureexceeds18 °C,asthegerminationrate increases.To date, no information has been found regarding the efectofthedoublelayercoatingofchitosanandbeeswaxon the physicochemical properties of ginger during storage,namely,themoistureandphenoliccontent,weightloss,TSS,and surface morphology. Tis study aims to evaluate thephysicochemicalpropertiesofthegingerbilayercoatedwith chitosan and beeswax during storage at diferent tempera- tures (18 and 25 °C) for up to 6months.2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Preparation of Coating Solution.Te coating solution consisted of chitosan solution and beeswax emulsion.Achitosan solution was prepared by referring to the methoddeveloped by Liu et al.[5].Chitosan was dissolved in HClsolution(1%)atconcentrationsof1.5and3%.TepHofthesolution was adjusted to 5.5 with the NaOH solution.
Beeswax emulsion was prepared according to the methoddevelopedbyYulianietal.[19].Beeswaxwasmeltedat 95±5 °C and then mixed with Tween 80 at a ratio of 1:1. Oleic acidandtriethanolamine(each ata percentage of50% ofbeeswax)wereaddedwhilestirredwithamagneticstirrer.Te resulting solution was added to the hot distilled water(95±5 °C)whilemixingwithanultra-turraxhomogenizerat a speed of 11,000rpm to form an emulsion solution.2.2.Application of Coating Solution.Te coating solution application was performed by immersion and spraying.Te ginger rhizome was dipped into chitosan solution (A; A1:1.5%and A2: 3%) for 10minutes and then air-dried (25 ±2 °C, RH 82%±1%).Tesecondlayerofcoatingwasappliedbyspraying the beeswax emulsion (B; B1: 3% and B2: 6%) on the surface ofthe air-dried chitosan-coated ginger rhizomes.
Te double-coated ginger was then air-dried with the help of a fan over-night.Teair-drieddouble-coatedginger(500g)waspackedinperforated polyethylene plastic bags(diametersof 2-3mm)andstoredatroomtemperature(25 ±2 °C,RH82%±1%)andinan air-conditioned room (18°C). Ginger without coating or packaging was also stored as a control sample.2.3.Physicochemical Property Analysis 2.3.1.Moisture Content.Moisture content was measured using a gravimetric method (drying in an oven).Te ginger sample(20g)wasplacedintoapreweightedaluminiumcup.Te sample was then dried in an oven (Memmert type UN 55, Germany) at 105 °C.Drying was carried out until there was no further weight loss, or around 24hours.Te dried gingers were then cooled in a desiccator for 15minutes andthenweighed.Temoisturecontentwascalculatedusingthefollowing equation [20] and expressed as a percentage ona wet basis (%, w.b.):2 Scientifca moisturecontent (%,wetbasis) �initialweight −finalweight initialweight×100%.
(1) 2.3.2.TotalPhenolicContent. Tetotalphenoliccontentwas determined according to the method of Singleton and Rossi with [21] slight modifcations.An extract sample and methanol were mixed to create a 500mg/L solution.After that, 40μL of the mixture was put into a well plate, and 150μL of 10% Folin-Ciocalteu was added.Following a 5- minute rest period, 150 μL of 6% Na 2CO3was added, and it was then left at room temperature for an additional90minutes.Inthisanalysis,gallicacidwasusedasastandardof measurement to calculate the amount of gallic acidequivalent/g of extract (GAE mg/g).With an Elisa ReaderSynergy HTX, the absorbance of the extract at a wavelengthof 725nm was determined.2.3.3.TotalSolubleSolid(TSS).TeTSSwasmeasuredusing the method described by Milosenic et al.[22].Te TSS was measured from extracted ginger juice in triplicate using theAtago DR-A1 digital refractometer (Atago Co.Ltd., Tokyo,Japan) at a temperature of 28 ±1 °C.Te TSS was expressed in Brix.
2.3.4.GingerPeelSurfaceStructure. Tesurfacestructureof the ginger peel was observed using the technique developed by Konarska [23] with slight modifcations.First, the gingerpeelwasdriedbyafreezedryeratatemperatureof −55 °Cfor 24hours and sliced into 5mm ×5mm in size.Next, the samples were coated with gold (Au) using a sputter coater(Merck Quorum Type Q150R ES, sputter time: 60seconds,sputter current: 20mA).Finally, the samples were observedby scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a Merck ZeissType Evoima10 with an electron high tension (EHT) of16kV.2.3.5.DataAnalyses.Teresultswereexpressedwithaone- way analysis of variance at each storage period.Te data werereportedasthemean±standarddeviation(Sd)ofthree replications.All statistical analyses were carried out usingthe SAS Portable 9.13 software.3.Results and Discussion 3.1.Moisture Content.Tere were changes in the physico- chemical properties of coated ginger during storage atdiferent temperatures.
Te moisture content of gingershowed signifcant diferences, both coated and uncoated,andbothstoredat18 °Cand25°C(Figure1).Gingerstoredat 18°Chadhighermoisturecontentsthanthosestoredat25°C. After six months of storage, ginger coated with 3% chitosanand 6% beeswax had the highest moisture content, bothstoredat18and25 °C(74.85%and60.05%,respectively).Te coating of ginger can maintain moisture, its natural colour,texture, and aroma [24, 25].Chitosan coating aids in thepreservationoffruitsandvegetablesbyactingasabarriertomoisture, O 2, and CO 2[9].3.2.WeightLoss.Gingerstoredatatemperatureof25°Clost more weight than that stored at an 18°C temperature (Figure 2).Commonly, during storage, the weight lossincreases due to the physiological processes of respiration, transpiration, and other processes by which ethylene gas and some volatile compounds may be lost [26].Te res-piration process producesCO 2gas,water,and energy[27].
Tese activities continue during storage and cause thepercentage of weight loss to increase. Storage at 18 °C resulted in much smaller weight loss than that at 25°C (Figure 2).According to Taghavi et al.[28], the storage ofrhizomes at low temperatures may prolong storage andreduce weight loss and sprouting; however, this may resultin a higher pathogen incidence than storage at ambienttemperature.In addition to the efects of temperature, the results of this study may indicate a protective function of chitosan and beeswax coatings.Te chitosan and beeswaxcoatings cover the stomata on the surface of the ginger,creating a barrier and thus reducing the rate of transpi-ration and respiration.Foo et al.[29] revealed thatchitosan-beeswax coating successfully reduced weight lossand microbial infection while maintaining total solublesolids, fruit frmness, and skin colour of sapodilla fruits.Sultan et al.
[30] also obtained similar results on Le Contepears coated with chitosan-beeswax-pollen grains, whichsignifcantly reduced weight loss compared to uncoated samples (control). 3.3.Phenolic Content.Phenolic compounds are charac- terised by the nearness of phenolic hydroxyl, which is in- cluded in polyphenols, which are an imperative portion of bioactive compounds [31].Phenolic compounds in gingerinclude gingerol and its derivatives, which have antioxidantactivities [1, 32].Te presence of phenolic compounds isusually used against pathogen attacks or in response tostressful environments [33].Te phenolic content tended todecrease during storage at all temperatures (Figure 3).Tephenolic content of ginger stored at 18 °C was higher than that stored at 25°C.Tis was diferent from that observed in ginger coated with konjac glucomannan, in which the totalphenols decreased during the frst 3days and then slightly increased at the end of storage for the 15-day storage period [8].
A similar trend was found in the total phenols of theuncoated ginger, which tended to be higher than that in thecoated one for the entire storage period, especially at theambient temperature. After 6months of storage at 18 °C, ginger coated with 3% chitosan and 6% beeswax had thehighest phenolic content (27.56mg/100g).Te coatingcould delay the release of bound phenolic during storage,resulting in a higher phenolic content over time [34].Te phenolic content ranged from 14.99mg/100g toScientifca 3 27.56mg/100g and 17.56mg/100g to 23.85mg/100g of ginger stored at 18°C and 25°C, respectively.3.4.Total Soluble Solid (TSS).Te total soluble solids (TSS) tendedtofuctuateduringstorage(Figure4).TedecreaseinTSSduringstoragewascausedbythelevelsofsimplesugars,which changed to alcohol, aldehydes, and amino acids [35].Te phenolic compounds also contain organic acids, amino acids, and pectin besides sugar [36].Te temperature was one of the factors that afected the increase in TSS.
Gingerstored at 18 °C had signifcantly higher TSS than the other stored gingers in the ffth week of storage [18]. Te increasein TSS might also be associated with a reduction in productmoisture content during storage time [37].Ginger stored at25 °C showed higher values of TSS than those stored at 18°C.Furthermore, after 6months of storage, the TSS rangedbetween4and6 °Brixat18°C.Tenat25°Ctemperature,TSS was found 8.5 to 11°Brix.Te hydrolysis process of poly- saccharides into monosaccharides and oligosaccharides willincrease the TSS content [38].Te coating treatment of 3%chitosan and 6% beeswax in fresh gingerdelays the decreaseof TSS during storage at 18 °C.It shows that this treatment delays amino acid and antioxidant degradation.3.5.GingerPeelSurfaceStructure.Temorphologyofginger peel,bothcoatedanduncoated,exhibitedasimilarstructure (Figure 5).

Te increase of cell wall-degrading enzymes will cause the formation of compartment spaces.Tis showed that polysaccharide modifcations in the middle lamella andcell walls led to cell wall damage and cell separation,resultingintheformationoflargecompartmentspaces[39].Tus, the coating with 3% chitosan and 6% beeswax might delaycelldamageandcellseparation,whichacceleratewater evaporation through transpiration.
