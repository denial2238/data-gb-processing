Currently, termination of the pregnancyistheonlytreatmentavailableforPE.Therefore,ﬁnding eﬀectivewaystopreventPEiscrucial.Vitamin A (VA) and vitamin E (VE) are fat-soluble vitamins (4), with retinol and carotene being the most common forms of VA (5) and alpha- and gamma-tocopherol being the predominant forms of VE in humans ( 6).Retinol is mainly derived from animal foods, while carotene is derived from plants ( 7).VE is mainly derived from vegetable oils, unprocessed grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables ( 8).
Recent studies have shown that VA and VE play important roles in antioxidation, inﬂammation, vision, immune health, and anti-apoptotic cellular processes ( 9–11). Antioxidative stress and anti-inﬂammatory responses are associated with PE in pregnant women ( 12), suggesting an association between VA, VE, and PE.Several epidemiological studies have suggested that VA and VE concentrations in maternal circulation, umbilical cord blood, and the blood serum of women with PE are lower than those seen in women with normal pregnancies ( 13–17).Some studies have shown that VA and VE supplementation during pregnancy can protect against PE ( 18–21).Our previous studies have found that dietary carotenoid intake is associated with PE risk (22).In contrast, some studies have suggested that there is no association between the risk of gestational hypertensive disorders and dietary VE intake ( 23).
However, such inconsistent results are possibly due to diﬀerences in the study populations, methods of assessingdietarynutrients,covariateadjustments,andsamplesizes. Moreover, the dietary patterns diﬀer among these studies ( 24).A recently conducted review showed that dietary VE or retinoic acid can protect women with low-risk pregnancies against developing PE (25).A previous retrospective study of 73,317 participants and 1,671 cases of PE found a positive correlation between a reduced serum VE concentration ( <7.3 mg/L) and PE ( 26).However, that study only included cases of PE reported during the ﬁrst trimester.The current case–control study was conducted to explore the association between dietary and serum concentrations of VA and VEwithPEriskinpregnantChinesewomen.Wehypothesizedthat a dose–response relationship exists between dietary and serum VA andVEandPErisk./two.tnum.Methods /two.tnum./one.tnum.
Study participants This1:1matchedcase–controlstudywasperformedintheFirst Aﬃliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, China, from March 2016toJune2019.Thestudydesignwasdescribedpreviously( 27). Cases were deﬁned as women diagnosed with PE based on China’s “Diagnosis and treatment guideline of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (2015)” ( 28).
In this guideline, PE is deﬁned as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥90 mmHg after 20 weeks of gestation, accompanied by anyofthefollowingcharacteristics:(1)urinaryprotein ≥0.3g/24h, or a urinary protein/creatinine ratio ≥0.3, or random urinary protein≥(+) (the test method used when urinary protein cannot be quantiﬁed); (2) non-albuminuria but with damage to organs orsystems such as the heart, lung, liver, kidney, and other important organs,orabnormalchangesinthebloodsystem,digestivesystem, nervoussystem,andplacental–fetalinvolvement.Pregnantwomen from the same hospital without hypertension or proteinuria were enrolled as controlsand matched withthe case groupbased onage (±3 years), gestational weeks ( ±1 week), and gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM)status.Theexclusioncriteriaforparticipantswere as follows: (1) refusal to participate in the study; (2) heart disease, malignant tumor(s), hyperthyroidism, an immune system disease, chronic renal insuﬃciency, or other chronic diseases; and (3) mentalorcognitivedisorderssuchasschizophreniaordepression.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Scientiﬁc Research and Clinical Trials of the First Aﬃliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (No. Scientiﬁc research 2016-LW- 34).All participants provided written informed consent before epidemiological data and biological specimens were collected.All procedures were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinkiguidelinesandregulations./two.tnum./two.tnum.Calculation of sample size The sample size of this 1:1-matched case–control study was calculated based on the OR estimated from previous studies (OR =0.45) (29).A sample size of 134 was calculated based on the aforementionedassumptions.With 80% statistical power and 0.05 two-sided signiﬁcance level, the sample size of each group was estimated to be 134.This study included 440 cases and 440 controls, thereby meeting the samplesizerequirements./two.tnum./three.tnum.
Data collection A structured questionnaire was used to collect information about sociodemographic characteristics (age, weeks of gestation, marital status, educational level, and household income) and dietaryintake.Theparticipants’height(m),weight(kg),andblood pressure were measured using digital scales, and the body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated. Gestational age was calculated fromthe1stdayofthelastmenstrualperiod.Passivesmokerswere deﬁnedasparticipantswhohadbeenexposedtoexhaledsmokefor atleast5min/doverthepastfewyears./two.tnum./four.tnum.Assessment of dietary VA and VE intake The dietary intake of VA and VE during the 3 months prior to giving birth was assessed using the semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) ( 30), which includes 78 foods commonly consumed by Chinese people.The intake frequency (0=never; 1 =per month; 2 =per week; and 3 =per day) and the amount consumed of each food were recorded.
The consumed nutrients ( µg or mg/day) and energy (kcal/day) were calculated based on the Chinese Food Composition Tables 2004 (31), including the nutrients and energy contained within each fooditem.

In brief, the serum samples (200 µl) were mixed with an internal standard solution (400 µl) and vortexed for 60s, and vitamins were then extracted using hexane and centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 5min). The supernatants were decanted and evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas until dry.The resulting extract was dissolved in ethanol (100 µl) and analyzed by liquid chromatography (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with tandem mass spectrometry (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, United States) to determine the serum concentrations of VA and VE.Forchromatographicseparation,0.1%formicacidsolutionand 0.1% methanol solution of formic acid were used as mobile phases A and B, respectively.Mass spectrometry analyses of VA and VE wereperformedusingpositiveelectrosprayionizationandmultiple reaction monitoring modes.All procedures were performed by the same technician who was blinded to the participants’ case– controlstatus./two.tnum./six.tnum.
Statistical analysis Unpaired t-testsorWilcoxonsigned-ranktestswereusedtotest diﬀerencesinquantitativevariables,andunpairedchi-squaredtests were used to identify diﬀerences in qualitative variables between cases and controls. The dietary intake data were adjusted for total energyintakeusingtheresidualmethod( 33).According to the distribution among the controls, the dietary VA and VE intake and serum VA and VE concentrations were divided into quartiles (Q1–Q4).ORs and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for the associations of dietary VA and VE intake and serum VA and VE concentrations with PE risk were estimated using multivariate conditional logistic regression models.Tests for trends were performed by using the median of each quartile as a continuousvariableintheregressionmodels.
Potential confounders were adjusted for in the multivariate models, including age, gestational age, pre-pregnancy BMI, family historyofhypertension(yesorno),educationlevel(primaryschool or less, secondary/high school, college/university, or above), parity (0 births, 1 birth, ≥2 births), physical activity, and daily energy intake.AsensitivityanalysisoftherelationshipbetweendietaryVA andVEintakeandPEriskwasperformedbyexcludingparticipants with GDM. Potential non-linear associations of dietary and serum VA and VE concentrations with PE risk were examined using restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis.The 20th, 50th, and 80th percentiles were retained as knots.The RCS was calculated using R 4.0.3.All other analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 (SPSSInc.,Chicago,IL,UnitedStates).Atwo-tailed P-valueof <0.05was considered statistically signiﬁcant.The missing values in our study wereignoredastheywere <10%./three.tnum.Results /three.tnum./one.tnum.
Baseline characteristics The demographic characteristics and PE-related factors of 440 cases and controls are described in Table1. There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences identiﬁed between PE cases and controls in terms of age (cases vs.controls: 30.9 ±5.03 years vs.31.0 ± 4.85 years, P=0.114), gestational week (cases vs.controls: 34.2 ±2.90 weeks vs.34.2 ±2.67 weeks, P=0.066), energy-adjusted dietary VE intake (cases vs.controls: 30.39 mg/d vs.30.90 mg/d, P=0.310), GDM (cases vs.controls: 59 (13.0) vs.59 (13.0), P= 1.000), polycystic ovarian syndrome (cases vs.controls: 10 (2.3) vs.6 (1.4),P=0.454), income ( P=0.405), physical activity ( P= 0.241), or multivitamin supplement user ( P=0.177).Compared with the control group, PE patients had a higher frequency of a family history of hypertension and greater pre-pregnancy BMI ( P <0.001),andalowereducationallevel( P=0.014)anddailyenergy intake (P=0.001).

A randomized trial in Nepal found that supplementation with either VA (RR =0.60; 95% CI: 0.37–0.97)or β-carotene(RR =0.51;95%CI:0.30–0.86)decreased pregnancy-associated mortality rates ( 34). A prospective cohort studyinChinaincluding12,245participantsfoundthatthosewith higher dietary VA intake ( ≥227µg RE/day) had a lower risk of new-onset hypertension (adjusted HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.63–0.78) (35).Ourresultsareconsistentwithpreviousstudies,withtheRCS curvessuggestingreverseJ-shapedassociationsbetweenthedietary Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/five.tnum frontiersin.org Liu et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/five.tnum/five.tnum FIGURE /one.tnum Multivariable-adjusted ORs (solid lines) and /nine.tnum/five.tnum% CIs (dashe d lines) for PE risk according to dietary (A)VA,(B)β-carotene, (C)retinol, and (D)VE intake.

These ﬁndings are supported by our study. We found no evidence supporting a signiﬁcant association between dietary VE intake and PE risk ( P=0.481).However, a study conducted in Australia showed that lower VE intake was associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders (RR =1.75, 95% CI: 1.11–2.75, P=0.02) (38).Furthermore, a case–control study suggested that VE supplementation during pregnancy reduced PE incidence (supplementary vs.control group: 7% vs.13%, P <0.05) (39).The inconsistencies between these studies and our ﬁndings may be due to diﬀerences in the dietary VE intake Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/six.tnum frontiersin.org Liu et al.

Some studies have reported that the plasma, maternal blood, umbilical cord blood, and tissues of pregnant women with PE have lower VA and VE concentrations than those of healthy pregnant women (all P<0.05) (40–43). Our ﬁndings disagree with these previous epidemiological studies, as we observed elevated serum VA (case vs.control: 318 ±146 vs.269 ±125,P=0.003) and VE(case vs.control: 15,101 ±4,664 vs.12,563 ±4,738,P<0.001) concentrations in participants with PE compared to controls.A study that included participants with severe PE reported that the plasma VE concentrations were signiﬁcantly elevated in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension compared to normotensive pregnant women.Moreover, this study reported increased levels of lipid peroxidation in severely pre-eclamptic women compared to healthy pregnant women ( 44).
In addition, a case–control study reported that the mean plasma VE concentrations were signiﬁcantly higher in women with PE than in control patients Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/seven.tnum frontiersin.org Liu et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/five.tnum/five.tnum (1.41±0.39 vs.1.15 ±0.32 mg/dl, P<0.001) (36).An additional study also reported signiﬁcantly higher umbilical vein plasma VE concentrationsinwomenwithPEthanincontrols[5.7(3.6–7.1)vs.3.6(3.3–4.5) µmol/L,P<0.001](45).However,aprospectivestudy reportednormalplasmaVEconcentrationsinwomenwithPEand identiﬁed a signiﬁcant positive correlation between gestational age and VE concentrations among both the healthy controls and PE patients ( 46).A case–control study that included 4,188 pregnant women found higher serum concentrations of VA ( P<0.05) in women with PE than in controls ( 47).
Similarly, another study reported that the serum VA concentrations of pregnant women with PE at 12–20 weeks of gestation were higher than those of healthy controls ( 14). However, a retrospective study found that serum vitamin A and vitamin E levels were negatively correlated withtheseverityofpre-eclampsia( P<0.001)(48).Therefore,more large-scale studies are needed to verify the relationship between serumconcentrationofvitaminA,vitaminE,andPE.Our results identiﬁed a discordance between the associations of dietary intake of VA and serum concentrations of VA with PE.Studies have shown that serum VA is associated with dietary VA intake(39).However,inourstudy,dietaryVAintakeinthecontrol group was higher than that in the case group, while the serum VA concentration in the control group was lower than that in the case group.
The possible reason is that impaired renal function in PE reduces the renal catabolism of the VA carrier retinol-binding protein to transthyretin, thereby increasing circulating VA levels (49). Alternatively, late pregnancy is associated with increased levels of oxidative stress, and VA is a strong non-enzymatic antioxidant in the antioxidant defense system of the human body andhasthefunctionsofantioxidation,scavengingfreeradicals,and anti-apoptosis ( 47,50).If the serum VA content is low in pregnant women, it will cause excessive accumulation of free radicals and increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes ( 48).Therefore, VAmightprotectagainstPE viasuchantioxidativeeﬀects.Several lipid-soluble antioxidants, such as VA and VE, may play a mechanistic role in the development of PE, although how these molecules function in this context remains to be determined.
Recent studies have shown that altered placental inﬂammatory status and impaired antioxidative stress pathways may play a role in the pathophysiology of PE ( 51–53). VA and VE have been implicated as having anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidative stress properties ( 54–57), which could reduce the risk of developing PE.A review found that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels decreased after VE supplementation and that acute- phase proteins or proinﬂammatory cytokines (e.g., CRP and interleukin-6) are markers of inﬂammation ( 58).Other studies havesuggestedthatVAandcarotenoidscanquenchsingletoxygen and neutralize sulfhydryl radicals to reduce oxidative stress ( 59– 61).It is, therefore, possible that VA reduces oxidative stress and associatedinﬂammation,therebyreducingtheriskofPE( 62,63).In our study, some limitations should be acknowledged.First, the use of FFQs in dietary surveys may lead to recall bias, limiting the accuracy of our results.
Therefore, we conducted a face-to-face survey and used food photographs to help participants to assess their food portions. Second, the information we obtained about dietary intake was based on the participants’ recollection of their dietduringtheﬁrst3monthsofthestudyperiod,whichpotentiallylimited the accuracy.However, our ﬁndings can still be used to examinetherelationshipbetweendietaryVAandVEintakeandPE risk,asthetimefromtheonsetofPEtodeliveryisoften <3months.Third, although we adjusted for possible confounding variables, potentiallyunknownfactorsmayhaveinﬂuencedtheresults./five.tnum.Conclusion We found that dietary VA intake was signiﬁcantly negatively correlatedwithPErisk,andserumVAandVEconcentrationswere signiﬁcantly positively correlated with PE risk among pregnant Chinese women.Further prospective cohort studies and RCTs are warrantedtoverifytheseassociations.
