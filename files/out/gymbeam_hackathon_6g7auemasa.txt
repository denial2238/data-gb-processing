ABCB5 has been identi ﬁed as a marker of skin progenitor cells, melanoma, and limbal stemcells. It has also been associated with multidrug resistance inseveral cancers.The unique feature of ABCB5 is that it exists asboth a full transporter (ABCB5FL) and a half transporter (ABCB5 β).Several studies have shown that the ABCB5 β homodimer does not confer multidrug resistance, in contrastto ABCB5FL.In this study, using three complementary tech-niques, (1) nanoluciferase-based bioluminescence resonanceenergy transfer, (2) coimmunoprecipitation, and (3) proximityligation assay, we identi ﬁed two novel heterodimers in mela- noma: ABCB5 β/B6 and ABCB5 β/B9.Both heterodimers could be expressed in High-Five insect cells and ATPase assays revealed that both functional nucleotide-binding domains of homodimers and heterodimers are required for their basalATPase activity.These results are an important step towardelucidating the functional role of ABCB5 βin melanocytes and melanoma.
ABCB5 is an ABC transporter that is a member of one of the largest, most ancient superfamilies of proteins found in allliving organisms. Mammalian ABC proteins are classi ﬁed into seven families from A to G based on sequence homology ( 1).In humans, ABC transporters are mostly exporters, with theexception of ABCA4 ( 2) and ABCD4 ( 3), which are importers.They exist either as full transporters with two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) or as half transporters with one TMD and one NBD, whichmust either homodimerize or heterodimerize to becomefunctional.However, not all are transporters.ABCE and ABCFmembers exist as twin NBDs without TMDs and are involvedin mRNA translation control ( 4).
The ABCC family includes ABCC7, an ATP-gated chloride channel that is also known asthe cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( 5), while ABCC8 and ABCC9 serve as regulatory subunits of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (Kir6.x) ( 6).ABCB5 has been highlighted as a marker of skin progenitor cells ( 7), melanoma stem cells ( 8), and, more recently, limbal stem cells ( 9). It has also been reported to be a mediator of multidrug resistance in melanoma ( 10), breast cancer ( 11), colorectal cancer ( 12,13), hepatocellular carcinoma ( 14), and several hematological malignancies ( 15,16).Despite these re- ports, characterization of ABCB5 remains minimal.Severaltranscripts of human ABCB5 have been identi ﬁed and tran- scribed from at least two different promotors, as reported in the Zenbu genome browser.
According to the AceView pro-gram, which provides a strictly complementary deoxy-ribonucleic acid (cDNA)-supported view of the humantranscriptome and genes, ABCB5 gene transcription gives rise to at least 11 different transcript variants ( 17). Among these, three variants have been documented: ABCB5.b ( 7) (812 aa, also referred to as ABCB5 β), ABCB5.h ( 18) (131 aa, also referred to as ABCB5 α), and ABCB5.a ( 19) (1257 aa, also referred to as ABCB5FL full-length).ABCB5 βwas predicted to have a TMD composed of six α- helices ﬂanked by two intracellular NBDs ( 20).Conventional half transporters possess only one NBD, either at the N- or theC-terminal region ( 21).The ABCB5 βN-terminal NBD lacks the Walker A motif, which precludes the binding of ATP.However, ABCB5 βcould dimerize to form a functional transporter.Potential dimerization motifs have been identi ﬁed in its N-terminal region ( 20 ).
Nevertheless, it has been shown that an ABCB5 βhomodimer cannot confer drug resistance in either the yeast model Saccharomyces cerevisiae or in mammalian cells ( 19,22). Since these studies focused on a limited number of drugs, we cannot exclude the possibility thatthis homodimer might be involved in drug resistance or bio-logical functions that have yet to be unraveled.Yet, it is also worth considering that ABCB5 βcould dimerize with other half transporters of the ABCB family to become functional.Interestingly, ABCB5 βbelongs to a family that comprises both full and half transporters.These latter include ABCB2/TAP1, ABCB3/TAP2, ABCB6, ABCB7, ABCB8, ABCB9/TAPL, and ABCB10.
The ﬁrst two, ABCB2 and ABCB3, are known to dimerize in the membrane of the endoplasmic re-ticulum (ER) to transport peptides from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen, where they associate with major histocompatibility complex class I molecules and are presented to T-lymphocytes *For correspondence: Jean-Pierre Gillet, jean-pierre.gillet@unamur.be .

Bergam and colleagues demonstrated that ABCB6 is involved in the early steps of melanogenesis ( 28). Furthermore, mutations in this gene are responsible for dys- chromatosis universalis hereditaria, a rare pigmentary geno-dermatosis ( 29).ABCB5 and ABCB8 have been proposed to play a role in the transport of melanin metabolites ( 30).These transporters could mediate the sequestration of toxic melaninmetabolites into lysosomes or melanosomes, thereby protect-ing melanocytes.In melanoma, they could sequester drugs inthese organelles ( 31).To date, no strong experimental evi- dence supports these conjectures.Considering that several ABCB half transporters form functional heterodimers, wehypothesized that ABCB5 βmight heterodimerize with other related members of the ABCB family, possibly, ABCB6,ABCB8, or ABCB9.
In this study, we identi ﬁed two novel heterodimeric ABC transporters in melanoma, ABCB5 β/B6 and ABCB5 β/B9, us- ing three complementary techniques: nanoluciferase-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET), coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and proximity ligation assay(PLA). When ABCB5 β/B6 and ABCB5 β/B9 heterodimers were fused with the P-glycoprotein (P-gp, also named ABCB1)ﬂexible linker region and expressed in High-Five insect cells, they exhibited signi ﬁcant levels of basal ATPase activity.This discovery paves the way for a better understanding of the rolesplayed by these heterodimeric transporters in melanoma.Results NanoBRET assay reveals ABCB6 and ABCB9 as interactingpartners of ABCB5 β We hypothesized that ABCB5 βmight heterodimerize with a half transporter of the ABCB family.
A review of the literature,which shows ABCB2-ABCB3 and ABCB7-ABCB10 interac- tion, led us to select three half transporters, namely ABCB6, ABCB8, and ABCB9, as possible partners for ABCB5 β.T o study the putative interactions between ABCB5 βand these proteins, we conducted a NanoBRET assay as described inFig. S1 .Each of the four proteins was tagged with either a NanoLuc-donor or HaloTag-acceptor at either the amino (N)or carboxy (C) terminus of the protein, resulting in 16 con-structs and eight potential donor/acceptor combinations for each protein pair ( Fig.S1 B).For each combination to be tested, two constructs (one with NanoLuc and one with HaloTag)were transfected in HEK-293T cells and either the ﬂuorescent NanoBRET HaloTag 618 ligand or a dimethyl sulfoxyde(DMSO) vehicle was added to the cells.
The NanoBRETNanoLuc substrate was then added, and donor and acceptorsignals were measured, which allowed us to calculate aNanoBRET ratio by dividing the acceptor emission value by the donor emission value for each sample in both conditions. To factor in the donor-contributed background, we subtractedthe no-ligand control NanoBRET ratio ( i.e., DMSO vehicle) from the ligand-containing sample NanoBRET ratio to obtainthe corrected NanoBRET ratio ( Fig.S1 B).As controls for the assay, we also tested the interaction between additional ABC proteins.To this end, we tested thefully characterized ABCB2/B3 heterodimer as a positivecontrol ( 23).Furthermore, we tested the putative in- teractions between ABCB2 –ABCD1 and ABCB3 –ABCD1 proteins as negative controls, since the ABCB2/B3 hetero-dimer is expressed in the ER membrane while ABCD1 is aperoxisomal transporter.As an additional control, we alsolooked for a possible interaction between ABCB5 βand ABCD1 proteins.
Each tested protein pair yielded a high NanoBRET ratio for one or more donor/acceptor combinations, suggesting heter- odimerization ( Fig. S1 B).Variations in the transfection ef ﬁ- ciency of the donor and acceptor constructs or the constitutiveexpression of the proteins led to an environment in which theconcentrations of all partners were not regulated, renderingany quantitative assumption dif ﬁcult.As a result, in this experiment, the NanoBRET ratio was used as qualitative in-formation.Ratios similar to the no-ligand negative controlwere classi ﬁed as noninteracting, while ratios above that sug- gested heterodimerization.It should be noted that a major drawback of resonance energy transfer assays ( e.g.,FRET, BRET, and NanoBRET) is that a signal can be detected when proteins are in closeproximity but do not interact together ( 32).
This is typically the case for transmembrane proteins, as under overexpressionconditions, membrane crowding may lead to protein aggre-gates in which donors and acceptors can transfer energy to one another without the generation of heterodimers. To overcome this limitation, we decided to decrease the amount of donorand acceptor constructs linearly.Nonspeci ﬁc interaction should result in decreased NanoBRET ratios, while these ratiosshould remain stable if the interaction is speci ﬁc.For this experiment, we chose the best donor/acceptor combination based on the highest NanoBRET ratio ( Fig.S1 B).The absence or low signal in alternative tag combinations for a tested pair indicates that the tags might be either too far from one another to transfer energy, not correctly oriented, or mightbe impairing protein folding, localization, or dimerization ( 33).
Therefore, the pair with the largest NanoBRET ratio repre-sents the combination for which both tags are in the bestconformation to transfer energy to one another. The selectedpairs are highlighted in Fig.S1 B.HEK-293T cells were transfected with decreasing amounts of NanoLuc (donor) and HaloTag (acceptor) constructs ranging from 1 μg to 0.125 μg for each construct ( Fig.1 ).The NanoBRET ratio decreased, along with the DNA amount, forthe ABCB2-ABCD1, ABCB3-ABCD1, and ABCB5 β -ABCD1 pairs tested as negative controls ( Fig.1 A) and stayed constant regardless of the amount of DNA transfected for ABCB2-ABCB3, which served as a positive control ( Fig.1 B).Inter- estingly, NanoBRET ratios remained similar in all conditions for ABCB5 β/B6 and ABCB5 β/B9, suggesting that these pro- teins might form true heterodimers.The NanoBRET ratioABCB5 βheterodimerizes with ABCB6 and ABCB9 in melanoma 2J.Biol.Chem.
(2024) 300(2) 105594 obtained for ABCB5 β-ABCB8 decreased along with the amount of DNA transfected, similar to the data generated from protein pairs assessed as negative controls. Donor saturation assay con ﬁrms the speci ﬁcity of the interaction between ABCB5 β/B6 and ABCB5 β/B9 protein pairs To con ﬁrm the speci ﬁc interaction of the ABCB5 β-ABCB6 and ABCB5 β-ABCB9 protein pairs and the false positive sig- nals of the ABCB5 β-ABCB8, ABCB2-ABCD1, ABCB3- ABCD1, and ABCB5 β-ABCD1 protein pairs, a saturation assay was performed in HEK-293T cells ( Fig.2 ).In this experiment, the amount of donor construct was held constant,while the amount of acceptor construct was graduallyincreased.For this assay, the smallest concentrations of donorand acceptor showing heterodimerization were used.
If theinteraction between both proteins is speci ﬁc, the NanoBRET signal will increase in a hyperbolic manner, reaching a plateauwhen all the donors are saturated with the acceptors and luminescence can no longer increase. On the other hand, for a nonspeci ﬁc interaction, the signal will increase linearly with an increasing acceptor concentration ( Fig.2 A).At these concen- trations, the signal from a nonspeci ﬁc interaction will not reach a plateau due to the lack of af ﬁnity between proteins.We carried out this donor saturation assay on the ABCB2- ABCB3 protein pair used as a positive control and comparedthe data to that from the three protein pairs chosen as negative controls.As shown in Figure 2 B, the NanoBRET signal was saturable for the ABCB2-ABCB3 protein pair, while a linearincrease was observed for the ABCB2-ABCD1, ABCB3- ABCD1, and ABCB5 β-ABCD1 pairs.This supports the speci- ﬁcity of the interaction for the ABCB2-ABCB3 protein pair.
The speci ﬁcity of the interaction was then assessed for the three protein pairs of interest. The analysis of the data revealeda hyperbolic increase in the NanoBRET signal that eventuallyreached a plateau phase for both the ABCB5 β-ABCB6 and ABCB5 β-ABCB9 protein pairs, similar to what was observed for the positive control.On the contrary, the donor saturation assay further supported a nonspeci ﬁc interaction between the ABCB5 βand ABCB8 proteins ( Fig.2 C).Co-IP and PLA con ﬁrm interactions in cells between the ABCB5 β-ABCB6 and ABCB5 β-ABCB9 heterodimers Co-IP is considered one of the standard methods for iden- tifying or con ﬁrming the occurrence of protein –protein inter- action events.Because of this, as a ﬁrst step, we used HEK-293T cells, which constitutively express ABCB6 and ABCB9.Since the expression of ABCB5 βhad not been demonstrated in this cell line, we transfected them with mCherry-tagged ABCB5 β (Fig.S2 ).
The proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated using either an anti-mCherry, ABCB5, ABCB6, or ABCB9antibody, and the interacting partners were analyzed usingWestern blotting after SDS-PAGE using corresponding anti-bodies to show protein −protein interaction ( Fig. S2 ).An isotype control was used to determine the speci ﬁcity of the signal ob- tained in the Western blots.A CB Figure 1.NanoBRET dilution assay reveals two putative heterodimers, ABCB5 β/B6, and ABCB5 β/B9.HEK-293T cells were transfected with decreasing amounts of NanoLuc and HaloTag constructs.Transfection started at 1 μg and gradually decreased to 0.125 μg per construct.DMSO refers to the technical negative control to which DMSO is added instead of ligand.Protein pairs serving as negative controls (ABCB2-ABCD1, ABCB3-ABCD1, ABCD1-ABCB5 β)(A) and a positive control pair (ABCB2-ABCB3) ( B) were tested alongside ABCB5 β-ABCB6, ABCB5 β-ABCB8, and ABCB5 β-ABCB9 ( C).Data are presented as mean ± SD.
Simple linear regression was used to test whether the amount transfected signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced the NanoBRET ratio ( n= 3). p-values are represented on graphs as *** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, and p>0.05.For ABCB2-ABCD1 ( R2= 0.8719, F(1,10) = 68.07), ABCB3-ABCD1 ( R2= 0.6144, F(1,10) = 15.94), ABCB5 β- ABCD1 ( R2= 0.6661, F(1,10) = 19.95), and ABCB5 β-ABCB8 ( R2= 0.7526, F(1,10) = 30.41), the relation between both parameters was statistically signi ﬁcant.For ABCB2-ABCB3 ( R2= 0.0269, F(1,10) = 0.2767), ABCB5 β-ABCB6 ( R2= 0.0011, F(1,10) = 0.0113), and ABCB5 β-ABCB9 ( R2= 0.0204, F(1,10) = 0.2080), changes in the amount of transfected DNA did not in ﬂuence the NanoBRET ratio.DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxyde; NanoBRET, nanoluciferase-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer.ABCB5 βheterodimerizes with ABCB6 and ABCB9 in melanoma J.Biol.Chem.
(2024) 300(2) 105594 3 Membrane crowding, protein mislocalization, misfolding, and loss of function are some of the issues that might arisefrom membrane protein overexpression and the utilization of atag. Therefore, we decided to work with Mel JuSo and UACC-257, two melanoma cell lines that constitutively express thetarget proteins ( Fig.3 ).Immunoprecipitation with either an anti-ABCB5, ABCB6, or ABCB9 antibody detects theinteracting partners, which were identi ﬁed by Western blotting after an SDS-PAGE using the corresponding antibody.Thedata further supports the occurrence of interaction betweenthe ABCB5 β-ABCB6 and ABCB5 β-ABCB9 protein pairs (Fig.3 ).In situ validation of the interactions for these two protein pairs was obtained using a PLA in both Mel JuSo and UACC- A CB Figure 2.Saturation assay con ﬁrms speci ﬁc ABCB5 β–ABCB6 and ABCB5 β–ABCB9 interactions.A, the concentration of the donor is held constant while the concentration of the acceptor is increased.
If the interaction is speci ﬁc, the signal will reach a plateau where all donors are saturated with acceptors, and luminescence will no longer increase.

Coimmunoprecipitation of ABCB5 β-ABCB6 and ABCB5 β-ABCB9 demonstrates the presence of these heterodimers in Mel JuSo and UACC- 257 cells.The Mel JuSo ( A) or UACC-257 ( B) proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either an anti-ABCB5, anti-ABCB6, or anti-ABCB9 antibody.The precipitated proteins were revealed by Western blotting after SDS-PAGE using the corresponding antibody indicated on the right side of each blot.Fifteen micrograms of total proteins from the starting cell lysate were loaded in the ﬁrst lane, while the total IP eluate was loaded on the gel.
ABCB5 βwas expressed in High-Five insect cells, and total membrane proteins were prepared and loaded on the gel (High5 ABCB5 β) as a complementary molecular weight marker when using anti-ABCB5. An isotype control was performed to determine the speci ﬁcity of the signal obtained in Western blot.ABCB5 βheterodimerizes with ABCB6 and ABCB9 in melanoma 4J.Biol.Chem.(2024) 300(2) 105594 257 cells.A schematic image and explanation of the PLA process can be found in Fig.S3 .Strong red PLA signals were detected for ABCB5 β-ABCB6 and ABCB5 β-ABCB9, indicating interactions between the studied protein pairs ( Fig.4 A).To further assess the speci ﬁcity of the PLA signal, multiple con- trols were performed.Biological controls were conducted inwhich Mel JuSo and UACC-257 cell lines were produced that stably expressed either a nontargeting shRNA or an ABCB6- speci ﬁc (or ABCB9-speci ﬁc) shRNA, resulting in the decrease of either ABCB6 or ABCB9 expression.
Figure 4 ,B and Cshow the resulting decrease of expression at the mRNA and protein levels. In both cell lines, stable knockdown ofeither ABCB6 or ABCB9 resulted in a statistically signi ﬁcant decrease in PLA signal ( p<0.0001) as compared to the nontargeting shRNA samples ( Fig.4 D).Technical controls were also conducted in which just one of the two antibodies directed against the proteins of interest was added or neitherwas added ( Fig.4 D).ABCB5 β/B6 and ABCB5 β/B9 linked with the P-gp linker exhibit basal ATPase activity Next, we wanted to determine whether ABCB5 β-ABCB6 and ABCB5 β-ABCB9 could hydrolyze ATP, which is required for the transport of substrates across membranes.Geneticconstructs were generated to ensure that we were studying thefunction of these transporters after heterodimerization and nothomodimerization.
These constructs were composed of eachhalf transporter cDNA fused with its interacting partner usingtheﬂexible linker region of P-gp, comprised of 57 amino acids (residues 703N –760D). As described by Bhatia et al., this design guarantees heterodimerization but has no effect on either the localization or behavior of the transporter ( 34).Moreover, due to the highly ﬂexible nature of the P-gp linker region, its structure remains elusive as it has not been solved inany of the high-resolution structures of this transporter.Toassess all possible orientations, four different constructs wereprepared (ABCB5 β_P-gp linker_ABCB6, ABCB6_P-gp link- er_ABCB5 β, ABCB5 β_P-gp linker_ABCB9, and ABCB9_P-gp linker_ABCB5 β).High-Five insect cells were transduced us- ing baculovirus, encoding the aforementioned recombinantDNA, and harvested 58 to 72 h after infection.Total mem-brane vesicles were prepared as described in the methodssection.
To con ﬁrm the expression of the heterodimer chi- meras in the insect cells, SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie-blue staining ( Fig. 5 A) or SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig.5 B), using anti-ABCB5, anti-ABCB1, anti-ABCB6, and anti-ABCB9 antibodies, were performed.Insect cell membrane vesicles expressing only ABCB5 β, ABCB6, and ABCB9 were used as a control for the homodimeric form.Moreover, usingsite-directed mutagenesis, transporters of interest harboringan amino acid mutation in their Walker B motif of NBD werealso prepared and used as negative controls.The substitutionof an E with a Q abolishes in the transporter ’ s ability to hy- drolyze ATP.For the chimeric heterodimers, two different mutants were prepared, either mutation in the Walker B motif from both interacting partners or mutation only in the WalkerB from the transporter located at the C terminus.
The following EQ mutants were generated: ABCB5 βE736Q, ABCB6 E752Q, ABCB9 E668Q, ABCB5 β_P-gp linker_ABCB6 E736Q/E1621Q, ABCB6_P-gp linker_ABCB5 βE752Q/ E1635Q, ABCB5 β_P-gp linker_ABCB9 E736Q/E1537Q, ABCB9_P-gp linker_ABCB5 βE668Q/E1559Q, ABCB5 β_P-gp linker_ABCB6 E1621Q, ABCB6_P-gp linker_ABCB5 β E1635Q, ABCB5 β_P-gp linker_ABCB9 E1537Q, and ABCB9_P-gp linker_ABCB5 βE1559Q. After the preparation of total membrane vesicles from High-Five insect cells, theexpression of these EQ mutants was con ﬁrmed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie-blue staining ( Fig.5 A) and Western blotting ( Fig.5 B).A schematic representation of the location of the mutations is shown in Figures 6 Aand 7A.Keniya and colleagues demonstrated the cross reactivity of anti-ABCB1 (mouse monoclonal C219) with ABCB5 β(22).Figure 5 C shows that anti-ABCB1 was also able to recognize ABCB5 β when expressed alone or fused with its interacting partnersusing the P-gp linker.
This is due to the signi ﬁcant sequence homology between the NBDs of ABCB5 βand ABCB1(22). Nevertheless, ABCB6 and ABCB9 did not cross react with theanti-ABCB1 antibody.This demonstrates that the epitope ofthe C219 antibody is not present in the NBDs of ABCB6 or ABCB9.InFigure 5 B, besides having a band at the expected molecular weight for ABCB5 β, ABCB6, and ABCB9 when expressed alone, at least one other band is visible at a molecular weight almosttwice as high in each instance.To determine if these bandsconsisted of homodimers, three genetic constructs were pre-pared which consisted of each transporter cDNA fused withitself using the P-gp linker region resulting in chimeric homo- dimers (ABCB5 β_P-gp linker_ABCB5 β,A B C B 6 _ P - g pl i n k - er_ABCB6, and ABCB9_P-gp linker_ABCB9).After SDS-PAGEfollowed by Western blotting, the chimeric homodimers wereindeed seen at a similar molecular weight as the band inquestion ( Fig.S4 ).
This demonstrates that dimers can still be detected, con ﬁrming the correct homodimerization of ABCB5 β, ABCB6, and ABCB9 in insect cells. The quanti ﬁcation of Coomassie-blue staining intensity of the monomer, ABCB5 β, ABCB6, and ABCB9 showed that these transporters are expressed at similar levels in High-Fiveinsect cells ( Fig.6 ,Aand B).The corresponding mutants, ABCB5 βE736Q, ABCB6 E752Q, and ABCB9 E668Q, also showed similar expression after Coomassie-blue staining(Fig.6 B).The different antibodies used, and their different reactivities, could explain the differences observed in the in-tensity of bands in Western blots.ATP hydrolysis was measured in the High-Five total membrane vesicles that expressed the homodimers, by the quanti ﬁcation of the inor- ganic phosphate released in a colorimetric assay.The threehomodimers showed signi ﬁcant ATPase activity, which was inhibited by beryllium ﬂuoride (BeFx) ( Fig.6 C).
The three transporters showed comparable ATPase activity as well asinhibition of this activity by BeFx. EQ mutants showed adecrease in ATPase activity greater than 50% ( Fig.6 C).The residual ATPase activity observed in the EQ mutants was similar to that observed for control High-Five insect cells notABCB5 βheterodimerizes with ABCB6 and ABCB9 in melanoma J.Biol.Chem.(2024) 300(2) 105594 5 A B C D Figure 4.Proximity ligation assay con ﬁrms the interactions between ABCB5 β-ABCB6 and ABCB5 β-ABCB9 protein pairs in Mel JuSo and UACC-257.A, confocal images of PLA in Mel JuSo and UACC-257 that stably expressed either a nontargeting shRNA or an ABCB6-speci ﬁc (or ABCB9-speci ﬁc) shRNA.The detected PLA signal is in red.Nuclei are stained in blue using DAPI.The scale bar represents 40 μM.After shRNA knockdown, ef ﬁciency was determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blots in Mel JuSo ( B) and UACC-257 ( C).
18S and tubulin were used as references for reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blots normalization, respectively (n = 2).

It is important to note that the N terminus of ABCB6 is located on the luminal side of the membrane vesicleswhereas the C terminus of ABCB5 βis in the cytoplasm. As a result, the CCTOP two-dimensional model assumes that thefusion of ABCB5 βwhen at the N terminus with ABCB6 in the C terminus leads to the trapping of one transmembrane helix from ABCB6 (TM1) in the cytoplasmic space because the P-gp linker hydrophilicity prevents it from crossing the membrane.This causes ABCB6 to lose one transmembrane helix (TM1)from its TMD0 ( Fig.7 A).Nevertheless, this conformation was expressed at a high level in High-Five insect cells as comparedto the three other heterodimer constructs.Interestingly, themeasured ATPase activity was similar across the four hetero-dimeric chimeras ( Fig.7 C).To determine whether the ATPase activity does actually come from the heterodimerization of our transporter of interest, the ATPase activity of the eight EQmutants described above was analyzed.
All conditions showedmore than 50% decrease in ATPase activity to about the samelevel as observed in membrane vesicles of control High-Fivecells, which con ﬁrms that most of the ATPase activity seen for the four chimeric heterodimers comes from their expres-sion in insect cells and their heterodimerization ( Fig. 7 C).Moreover, no signi ﬁcant difference can be seen between NBDs with one mutation or a combination of mutations in bothNBDs.For all the tested mutants, the decrease in BeFx-sensitive ATPase activity was due to a decrease in totalATPase activity, while the ATPase activity in the presence ofBeFx remained similar to that of their unmutated counterpart.As for the monomers, the residual ATPase activity of the EQmutants was similar to that obtained for control High-Five insect cells ( Fig.7 C).Next, ATPase activity for all the constructs was assessed in the presence of vanadate (Vi) instead of BeFx.
Lower inhibi-tion of ATPase activity was observed with 0.3 mM Vi,resulting in a lower Vi-sensitive ATPase activity than withBeFx ( Fig. S5 ).To visualize the potential interactions of ABCB5 βwith itself or with other transporters, three-dimensional models of the ABCB5 βhomodimer and heterodimers were constructed us- ing the approach of homology modeling, given the availabilityof the crystal structure of mouse ABCB1 (PDB: 5KPI and5KO2) and the high sequence identity between humanABCB5 βand mouse ABCB1, which is greater than 60% (Fig.S6 ).These models were further veri ﬁed by coevolutionary analysis by examining interacting residues present at variousdomain interfaces.The high degree of sequence identity among these trans- porters indicates homologous structure and function.Thethree-dimensional models indicate that the essential structural features of the ABCB5 βhomodimer and the ABCB5 β/B6 and ABCB5 β/B9 heterodimers are homologous with those of mouse P-gp.
These models also show that the TMD0sof ABCB6 and ABCB9 are not engaged in the interaction ofABCB5 βwith either ABCB6 or ABCB9 ( Fig. S6 ,Band C).Importantly, these models provide a key structural frameworkfor further research required to determine which residues ofthe TMDs from ABCB5 β, ABCB6, and ABCB9 are involved in the interaction.Discussion To explore the possible role of the ABCB5 βvariant, we conducted heterodimerization studies with potential targethalf transporters of the ABCB family in melanoma.The ABCBfamily comprises three full-length transporters ( i.e., ABCB1, B4, and B11) and seven half transporters.ABCB5 is the onlymember of the ABCB family that is found as both a fulltransporter (ABCB5FL) and a half transporter (ABCB5 β), with expression driven by independent promoters.Current knowledge of these transporters led us to focus on threecandidate heterodimers: ABCB5 β-ABCB6, ABCB5 β-ABCB8, and ABCB5 β-ABCB9.
Putative interactions between these three pairs of proteins were studied using the NanoBRET assayand con ﬁrmed using a Co-IP and PLA. Taken together, these assays revealed two novel heterodimeric ABC transporters inmelanoma cell lines.FRET microscopy in living cells has been applied to unravel the interactions of the peroxisomal ABC transporters ABCD1and ABCD3 ( 35).In this study, we carried out a NanoBRET assay, which does not require extrinsic excitation and providessubstantially increased detection sensitivity and dynamic rangeas compared to current BRET technologies ( 33).We demon- strated the importance of transfecting a low amount of donorand acceptor constructs to avoid either membrane crowding or protein aggregates that may lead to false positive BRET signals, as observed for ABCB8-ABCB5 β, ABCB2-ABCD1, ABCB3-ABCD1, and ABCB5 β-ABCD1 in Fig.S1 B.This so- called bystander signal is the result of two proteins that donot interact but are close enough to transfer energy ( 32).
The donor saturation assay con ﬁrmed the speci ﬁcity of the inter- action between the ABCB5 β/B6 and ABCB5 β/B9 protein pairs and demonstrated the nonspeci ﬁcity of the interactions for the other pairs of proteins (ABCB5 β/B8, ABCB2/D1, ABCB3/D1, and shRNA quanti ﬁcations are shown along with technical negative controls, including PLA conducted using either one antibody (AB) or none.

Co-IP was performed to con ﬁrm the occurrence of protein –protein interaction events using the particularly easy-to-transfect HEK-293T cells. Since ABCB5 β expression had not been observed in these cells, we transfectedthem with mCherry-tagged ABCB5 β.This experiment allowed us to con ﬁrm the data obtained from the NanoBRET assay using the same cell line.We wanted to assess protein –protein interaction in a relevant model with a native expression of thethree transporters of interest in order to avoid any potentialchanges in protein localization and membrane crowdingcaused by protein tags and protein overexpression.SinceABCB5 βis predominantly expressed in melanoma, we used two melanoma cell lines, Mel JuSo and UACC-257, which alsoconstitutively express ABCB6 and ABCB9.The goal was to validate the data in situ in live melanoma cell lines.As such, we carried out a PLA in melanoma cell lines that stably expresseither a nontargeting shRNA or an ABCB6-speci ﬁc (or ABCB9-speci ﬁc) shRNA.
This is the only experiment thatprovides qualitative and quantitative information. The quan- tiﬁcation of individual PLA signals, represented by red dots, revealed that ABCB5 β/B6 is more abundant than ABCB5 β/B9 in both tested cell lines.Altogether, this set of experimentsdemonstrates the existence of the two heterodimeric ABCtransporters in the Mel JuSo and UACC-257 melanoma cell lines.To study ABCB5 βheterodimers, four constructs were generated by fusing each of the interacting transporters withthe P-gp ﬂexible linker region in one of the two possible ori- entations, ABCB5 βat either the N or C terminus.After expression in High-Five insect cells, each heterodimerexpression was assessed and quanti ﬁed using Coomassie-blue staining and Western blotting.We found that the level of expression seems to be dependent on the orientation of each heterodimer (ABCB5 β/B6 or ABCB5 β/B9).
The ABCB5 β_P-gp linker_ABCB6 and ABCB9_P-gp linker_ABCB5 βheterodimers are expressed at higher levels than others (see Fig. 7 ).It is A BC Figure 6.Expression of homodimers in High-Five cells and BeFx-sensitive ATPase activity.A, two-dimensional schematic representation of ABCB5 β (purple ), ABCB6 ( orange ), and ABCB9 ( gray) structure based on CCTOP predictions ( 61).ABCB5 βhas one complete and another partial NBD and one TMD comprised of six transmembrane helices (TMs).The N-terminal NBD (NBD1) is truncated and lacks the conserved Walker A domain.ABCB6 has six transmembrane helices (TM6-TM11) that constitute its TMD1 and ﬁve additional transmembrane helices (TM1-TM5) in the N terminus that form the TMD0.ABCB9 has a TMD1 consisting of six transmembrane helices (TM5-10) and a TMD0 made of four transmembrane helices at the N terminus.

However, the transmembrane localiza- tion of this helix does not seem to be required for theexpression of ABCB5 β_P-gp linker_ABCB6 either in insect cells or for ATPase activity. This is consistent with the three- dimensional model of ABCB5 β/B6 and the conclusion made by Kiss and colleagues, who showed that the disruption ofABCB6 TMD0 leads to mislocalization without impairingeither its dimerization or ATPase activity ( 36).Similar results were obtained for ABCB9 TMD0; its expression was necessaryfor lysosomal targeting but not for transport function ordimerization ( 37).After expression in High-Five insect cells, the ATPase ac- tivity of each heterodimer was measured.In Figures 6 and7, the ATPase activity is quanti ﬁed per mg of membrane protein and is not normalized to the transporter expression.
However,when considering the expression levels determined afterCoomassie-blue staining quanti ﬁcation, ABCB5 β_P-gp link- er_ABCB9 displayed the highest basal ATPase activity, fol-lowed by ABCB9_P-gp linker_ABCB5 β, ABCB6_P-gp linker_ABCB5 β, and ABCB5 β_P-gp linker_ABCB6. More ex- periments are needed to evaluate the in ﬂuence of ABCB5 β orientation on protein expression and ATPase activity of theheterodimers.For the homodimers, similar levels of expressionand ATPase activities were observed.To determine whether the ATPase activity observed for the homodimers and heterodimers was mediated by dimerizationof the transporters and was not the result of contamination, a point mutation of a E to a Q was made in the Walker B motif of each transporter.For the heterodimers, either the C ter-minus Walker B was mutated or Walker B motifs in the twoNBDs were mutated.
All EQ mutants resulted in a signi ﬁcant decrease in ATPase activity, while their expression remainedsimilar to their nonmutated counterparts. As seen in Figures 6 and7, approximately 40% of residual ATPase activity remained after mutations in the NBDs of the transporters of interest.Part of this ATPase activity could come from the transporter itself.In fact, it is not uncommon to obtain a residual ATPaseactivity for EQ mutants.Janas and colleagues showed thatpuriﬁed NBD of Mdl1p, a homolog of the human ABC transporter TAP in S.cerevisiae , with an E559Q mutation, had residual ATP hydrolysis, though it was much lower than thatof the WT protein ( 38).Similarly, the E630Q mutation in the human ABCD1 Walker B motif only resulted in a one third decrease of ATPase activity ( 39).In our case, only a 60% decrease is seen with the mutated transporters.
Nevertheless,the residual ATPase activity is similar to that observed for themembrane vesicles of control High-Five insect cells that werenot infected with baculoviruses. Therefore, this residualATPase activity most likely comes from other BeFx-sensitive ATPase pumps constitutively expressed in High-Five insectcells.Overall, the tested EQ mutants demonstrate that at least60% of the ATPase activity observed is mediated by the dimersstudied.Moreover, it shows that all heterodimers need twofunctional Walker B motifs to mediate basal ATP hydrolysissince mutation made to only the C terminus NBD of the protein also led to a similar decrease in ATPase activity.Identical observations were made for Mdr3 (mouse homologof P-gp).Mutations in either the ﬁrst Mdr3 NBD (E552Q) or the second NDB (E1125Q) both resulted in loss of ATPaseactivity ( 40).Therefore, our results demonstrate that both heterodimers exhibit basal ATPase activity that was inhibited by BeFx, but notby vanadate.
Similar results have been reported for ABCB4, ABCG1, ABCC1, and ABCC10, for which vanadate showed little to no inhibitory effect when compared to BeFx ( 41–43). At this point, further investigation is needed to identify ABCB5 β/B6 and ABCB5 β/B9 substrates and determine whether there is any speci ﬁcity in their substrate spectrum when compared to ABCB5 β, ABCB6, and ABCB9 homo- dimers.It is important to point out that both ABCB6 andABCB9 have been reported in the literature to be functional after homodimerization ( 44,45).If the heterodimers also have the ability to transport substrates, it explains the similarATPase activity obtained in our ATPase assays showing thecapability of all the tested transporters to perform a completecatalytic cycle.Nevertheless, it is possible that these hetero-dimers have no real transport function and only exist toregulate ABCB6 and ABCB9 homodimer formation.
Amongthe mammalian ABC transporter superfamily, previous pub- lications have shown that ABC transporters are able to interact with different partners. For instance, using chimeric dimers,ABCD1 and ABCD2 were able to form functional homo-dimers, as well as heterodimers, in the peroxisome ( 46).In HEK293 cells, ABCG4 formed either a homodimer or heter-odimer with ABCG1 ( 47).Nevertheless, the physiological relevance of having multiple interaction partners for ABCtransporters remains unknown.Understanding the physiological function of ABCB5 β/B6 and ABCB5 β/B9 heterodimers requires more study.The fact that both forms (homodimers and heterodimers) might coexistin cells, as is the case for the example mentioned above ( i.e., ABCD1/D2 and ABCG4/G1), remains challenging.In fact, theknock-down or downregulation of one interacting partnerultimately leads to the disappearance of both homodimers andheterodimers.
Therefore, the changes observed might not be associated with their heterodimerization. Moreover, little is known about ABCB5 βand additional investigation on this transporter is needed.Since so far, no substrates could beidenti ﬁed for the heterodimers, the best way to generate hy- potheses about their physiological function would be to quanti ﬁed using ImageJ (n = 3).C, the graph on the leftshows the ATPase activity for all heterodimer chimeras and their corresponding EQ mutants measured in both the absence and presence of BeFx as described in the method section, total ATPase activity, and BeFx-sensitive ATPase activity, respectively.On the right , data represent BeFx-sensitive ATPase activity, which is calculated by subtracting BeFx ATPase activity from the total ATPase activity (n = 3).In all panels, the names of EQ mutants are shown in red.BeFx, beryllium ﬂuoride.ABCB5 βheterodimerizes with ABCB6 and ABCB9 in melanoma J.Biol.Chem.
(2024) 300(2) 105594 11 determine their localization, and such studies are currently underway. Reports on ABCB6 localization have not been consistent; it has been shown to speci ﬁcally localize to the outer membrane of the mitochondria ( 48) and has also been reported to localize to both the outer mitochondrial membrane and the plasmamembrane ( 49).In a more recent study, ABCB6 was reported to have an endolysosomal localization ( 50).ABCB9, in contrast, was shown to go through the Golgi, be transported toendosomes and ﬁnally be traf ﬁcked to lysosomes ( 51).Recently, ABCB5 βwas shown to localize in the ER ( 52).Based on this information we can speculate that the heterodimers arelocalized in the ER or in lysosome-related organelles.Inconclusion, this study presents the ﬁrst evidence for two novel dimers with ATPase activity formed by the heterodimerization of ABCB5 βwith either ABCB6 or ABCB9 in Mel JuSo and UACC-257 melanoma cell lines.
This discovery is a step to-ward a better understanding of the role of ABCB5 βin mela- nocytes and melanoma. Experimental procedures Cell culture and transfection The HEK-293T cell line, which is a derivative of human embryonic kidney 293 cells, transformed with the SV40 T-antigen, and the Mel JuSo and UACC-257 melanoma cell lineswere cultured in Dulbecco ’s modi ﬁed Eagle ’s medium sup- plemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GE Healthcare LifeSciences) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) at 37 /C14C and 5% CO 2in a humidi ﬁed atmosphere.For transient transfections, cells were seeded to reach 70% conﬂuence in a 6-well plate.Four hours later, transfection with jetPRIME (Polyplus transfection) was carried out following themanufacturer ’s instructions.shRNAs constructs for the stable knockdown of human ABCB6 (sc-94721-SH) and ABCB9 (sc-60115-SH) were ob-tained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.A nonsilencing shRNAwas used as a control (sc-108060).
Reverse transfection wasperformed in antibiotic-free medium with jetPRIME, following the manufacturer ’s instructions (Polyplus transfection). Seventy-two hours after transfection, the selection of thetransfected cells was carried out by the addition of 2 μg/ml of puromycin.After 10 days of selection, ABCB6 and ABCB9mRNA and protein expression were assessed using reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction andWestern blot.DNA constructs For the NanoBRET constructs, ABCB2, ABCB3, ABCB5 β, ABCB6, ABCB8, ABCB9, and ABCD1 cDNAs were insertedinto the pCDNA3.1 expression vector and subcloned into theNanoLuc pNLF1-N[CMV/Hygro], the NanoLuc pNLF1-C[CMV/Hygro], the HaloTag pHTC HaloTag CMV-neo, andthe HaloTag pHTN HaloTag CMV-neo vector purchasedfrom Promega.
Restriction enzymes Not1-EcoR1, Nhe1- EcoR1, Not1-EcoR1, and Nhe1-EcoR1 were used, respectively.The mCherry-tagged ABCB5 mammalian expression construct (ID: 8488-X02-787), driven by a CMV promoter, wasprovided by Leidos Biomedical Research (formerly SAIC-Frederick, NCI). For the heterodimer constructs, ABCB5 βwith ABCB6 and ABCB5 βwith ABCB9 coding sequences were fused, following the NEBuilder HIFI DNA Assembly kit ’s instructions (New England Biolabs).The ABCB5 β-ABCB6, ABCB6-ABCB5 β, ABCB5 β-ABCB9, and ABCB9-ABCB5 βsequences were cloned in pDONR201 plasmid.Using the SACII restrictionenzyme, the sequence derived from P-gp ﬂexible linker region residues (NEVELENAADESKSEIDALEMSSNDSRSSLIRKRRSVRGSQAQDRKLSTKEALD) 703N-760D, was inserted be-tween each of the half transporters.DNA sequencing was usedto con ﬁrm both the correct orientation of the linker and absence of other mutations.

The EQ mutations in the Walker B domain of one or both NBDs of transporters were prepared using Q5 site-directed mutagenesis following the manufacturer ’s instructions (New England Biolabs).Mutated cDNAs were transferred into bac-mid (pDEST-008), and baculoviruses were generated by theProtein Expression Laboratory Cloning and OptimizationGroup (Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research).Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction Total RNA was isolated from Mel JuSo and UACC-257 using a NucleoSpin RNA Plus kit following the manufac-turer ’s instructions (Takarabio).
Reverse transcription was performed using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcrip- tion kit and 200 ng of total RNA (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed using TaqMan master mix (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc) and 18s expression was used to normalize data.The following probes from Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc were used: 18S (Hs03003631_g1), ABCB6 (Hs00180568_m1), andABCB9 (Hs00608640_m1).Nanoluciferase-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer Twenty-four hours after the transient transfection of the NanoLuc and HaloTag constructs, the cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized.Cells were counted and diluted in Opti-MEM supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum to reach adensity of 2 × 10 5cells/ml.One microliter of 0.1 mM HaloTag NanoBRET ligand 618 (Promega) per ml of cells, or DMSO inthe control conditions, was added.
One hundred microliters ofcells with either ligand or DMSO were plated in a 96-well plate(Corning 3917, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc) and were cultured overnight at 37 /C23C, 5% CO 2.

Relative light units obtained for donor and acceptor emis- sion were processed as follows to obtain milli bioluminescenceunits: emission 610 nm emission 447 nm¼BU×1000 ¼mBU For saturation experiments, percentages of the maximum NanoBRET ratio were plotted against the acceptor to donor ratio; data were ﬁtted using the “one site –total and nonspeci ﬁc binding ”ﬁt in Prism. Coimmunoprecipitation Five milligrams of total protein (from either HEK93T, Mel Juso, or UACC-257) in lysis buffer (120 mM NaCl, 50 mMTris, NP40 0.5%, 5 mM EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor) wereincubated on a rotating wheel at 4 /C14C for 4 h with 1 μgo f antibody: ABCB5 (600-401-A775, Rockland Immunochemi-cals), ABCB6 (G-10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ABCB9 (A-8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IgG Mouse (sc-2025, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dalla), and IgG Rabbit (sc-3888, Santa CruzBiotechnology).
Simultaneously, 25 μl of magnetic beads, Dynabeads-Protein A (Invitrogen), and Dynabeads-Protein G(Invitrogen) were added to an Eppendorf and washed twicewith 250 μl of lysis buffer using a magnetic rack. Thereafter, protein lysates with the antibody were added to the beads andincubated overnight at 4 /C14C on a rotating wheel.The following day, the beads were washed three times with 250 μl of cold PBS 0.05% Tween 20.Fifty microliters of elution buffer (DTT, Tris,Glycerol, SDS) were added, and samples were heated at 40 /C14C for 10 min.Samples were then analyzed using Western blot.SDS-PAGE and western blotting after Co-IP Samples were loaded on an 8% SDS acrylamide gel, migrated at 110 V, and transferred to a polyvinylidene di ﬂuoride mem- brane at 110 V for 1 h 30 mins.
The membrane was blocked for1 h in 5% milk diluted in PBS 0.05% Tween 20 and incubatedovernight with the following primary antibodies: anti-ABCB5 (600-401-A775, Rockland Immunochemicals), anti-ABCB6 (sc-365930, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ABCB9 (sc-39412, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-mCherry(ab167453, Abcam). Then, membranes were incubated for 1 hwith either Scan Later anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondaryantibodies (Molecular Devices); they were then washed withPBS 0.05% Tween 20 and revealed with the SpectraMax i3x(Molecular Devices).Alternatively, membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase –conjugated goat anti- mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Agilent Technologies),washed with PBS 0.05% Tween, and revealed with enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer).In situ PLA Cells grown on a coverslip were ﬁxed in 4% para- formaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with PBS + TritonX-100 0.2% for 10 min.
Then, a PLA was performed in accor-dance with the Duolink kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Brie ﬂy, the cover- slips were incubated with blocking solution for 1 h at 37 /C14Ci na humidity chamber.Then, they were incubated for 1 h at roomtemperature with primary antibody pairs raised against different species (mouse and rabbit) and diluted 1/200: ABCB5 β(LS- C169144, LSBio), ABCB6 (600-401-945, Rockland Immuno-chemicals), ABCB8 (ab83194, Abcam), and ABCB9 (PA5-99017, Invitrogen).Cells were incubated with PLA probesmouse PLUS and rabbit MINUS for 1 h at 37 /C14C.Next, ligation was performed for 30 min at 37/C14C, followed by ampli ﬁcation for 100 min at 37/C14C.Finally, the coverslips were mounted on mounting medium with 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma- Aldrich).The edges were sealed with clear nail polish.Images were obtained using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope(Leica Microsystems).4 0,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, argon, and 561 red ﬁlters were used.
The number of red dots per cell was counted using ImageJ software as described in Gomes et al (53). Each condition was obtained in biological triplicates.Structural homology models of ABCB5 βhomodimer and heterodimers An accurate alignment between the human ABCB5 βand mouse ABCB1 sequences was generated based on a multi- sequence alignment that includes various members of the ABCB family transporters.Based on this alignment, a struc-tural model of ABCB5 βwas constructed manually using the structural model of mouse P-gp (PDB:5KPI) ( 54) as a template, replacing the residues of mouse ABCB1 with the corre-sponding residues of ABCB5 βin the molecular graphics pro- gram Coot ( 55).The model was subsequently subject to energy minimization using the crystallographic re ﬁnement program Refmac ( 56).The construction of the heterodimeric ABCB5 β-ABCB6 model was initiated using a dimeric cryo-EM model of ABCB6(PDB:7D7N) ( 57).
A single monomer model of ABCB6 was superposed to the corresponding subunit of the ABCB5 β dimer model. Manual adjustments were made to make sure allhelices were correctly aligned with the NBDs using the mo-lecular modeling program Coot.The model was then energy minimized using the crystallographic re ﬁnement program Refmac.The ABCB5 β-ABCB6 model was rendered as ribbon diagram in the program PyMol ( https://pymol.org/2/ )(58).The construction of the ABCB5 βand ABCB9 heterodimeric model started with the construction of the homology model ofABCB9.The ABCB9 sequence was aligned with that ofABCB6.Mutations were manually introduced into the ABCB6subunit of the ABCB5 β-ABCB6 model based on the sequence alignment in Coot.The resulting ABCB5 β-ABCB9 model was then subjected to several cycles of energy minimization.ABCB5 βheterodimerizes with ABCB6 and ABCB9 in melanoma J.Biol.Chem.
(2024) 300(2) 105594 13 Insect cell total membrane preparation Trichoplusia ni (High-Five) insect cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 with a recombinant baculoviruscarrying one of the following sequences: ABCB5 β, ABCB6, ABCB9, ABCB5 β_P-gp linker_ABCB6, ABCB6_P-gp link- er_ABCB5 β, ABCB5 β_P-gp linker_ABCB9, ABCB9_P-gp linker_ABCB5 β, and their corresponding EQ mutants. Cells were harvested after 58 to 72 h, washed with PBS containing1% aprotinin, and stored at −80 /C14C.Total membrane vesicles were prepared with hypotonic lysis and differential centrifu-gation as detailed in ( 59).SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of insect cells membrane vesicles After incubation in loading dye (500 mM Tris –HCl pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 30% sucrose, 0.005% bromophenol blue, and 25% β mercaptoethanol) at 37 /C14C for 20 min, total membrane vesicles were electrophoresed on a 7% NuPAGE precast gel (Invi- trogen) for 1 h 10 mins at 150 V.
Then gels were either stained with Coomassie-blue (15 μg of protein per lane) (Instant blue, Abcam) or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.25 μgo r 1μg of protein per lane for the monomeric transporters and heterodimer, respectively) and probed with the following pri-mary antibodies overnight at 4 /C14C: anti-ABCB5 (600-401- A775, Rockland Immunochemicals), anti-ABCB1 (C219,Fujirebio), anti-ABCB6 (sc-365930, Santa Cruz Biotech- nology), anti-ABCB9 (sc-39412, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Then, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with horse-radish peroxidase –conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature andrevealed using ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad, Hercules).ATPase assay Total membrane vesicles prepared from High-Five insect cells were diluted in ATPase assay buffer (50 mM MES-Tris pH6.8, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM sodium azide, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mMouabain, 10 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM DTT) to reach a ﬁnal concen- tration of 10 μg protein/0.1 ml.
The reaction was started with the addition of 5 mM ATP and was performed at 37/C14C for 20 min. After 20 min, the reaction was terminated with 0.1 ml of 10% SDS.The amount of inorganic phosphate released was measured in both the presence and the absence of Vi (0.3 mM)and BeFx (0.2 mM beryllium sulfate and 2.5 mM sodium ﬂuo- ride) using a colorimetric method described in ( 60).Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism ( https://www.graphpad.com ) version 5.04 for Windows with either linear regression or an unpaired Student ’sttest.Statistical analysis is described in the ﬁgure legends.Statistical signi ﬁcance was deﬁned as p<0.05.All data are contained within the manuscript.
