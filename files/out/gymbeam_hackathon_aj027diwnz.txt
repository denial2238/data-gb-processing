Abstract: Sepsis syndrome develops through enhanced secretion of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Sepsis syndrome is characterized by vascular hyperpermeability, hypotension, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and increased mor- tality, among others.Endotoxemia-derived sepsis is an important cause of sepsis syndrome.During endotoxemia, circulating endotoxin interacts with endothelial cells (ECs), inducing detrimental effects on endothelium function.The endotoxin induces the conversion of ECs into ﬁbroblasts, which are characterized by a massive change in the endothelial gene-expression pattern.This downregulates the endothelial markers and upregulates ﬁbrotic proteins, mesenchymal transcription factors, and extracellular matrix proteins, producing endothelial ﬁbrosis.Sepsis progression is modulated by the consumption of speciﬁc nutrients, including ω-3 fatty acids, ascorbic acid, and polyphenolic antioxidant ﬂavonoids.
However, the underlying mechanism is poorly described. The notion that gene expression is modulated during inﬂammatory conditions by nutrient consumption has been reported.However, it is not known whether nutrient consumption modulates the ﬁbrotic endothelial gene-expression pattern during sepsis as a mechanism to decrease vascular hyperpermeability, hy- potension, MODS, and mortality.Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the consumption of dietary ω-3 fatty acids, ascorbic acid, and polyphenolic antioxidant ﬂavonoid supplements on the modulation of ﬁbrotic endothelial gene-expression patterns during sepsis and to determine the effects on sepsis outcomes.Our results indicate that the consumption of supple- ments based on ω-3 fatty acids and polyphenolic antioxidant ﬂavonoids was effective for improving endotoxemia outcomes through prophylactic ingestion and therapeutic usage.
Thus, our ﬁndings indicated that speciﬁc nutrient consumption improves sepsis outcomes and should be considered in treatment.

Despite numerous basic and clinical studies addressing sepsis syndrome, current therapies for treating it and its sequelae are unsatisfactory [ 4–6]. Endotoxemia-derived sepsis is an important cause of sepsis syndrome and is frequently characterized by the deposition of large amounts of the Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [ 7,8].During endotoxemia, the endotoxin circulating in the bloodstream interacts with the endothelial cells (ECs) located in the internal endothelial monolayer of blood vessels, inducing detrimental effects on endothelium function [8–11].It is well accepted that endothelial dysfunction is an important factor in the pathogen- esis of endotoxemia-derived sepsis syndrome and other inﬂammatory diseases.Endotoxin is able to induce the conversion of ECs into ﬁbroblasts [ 12–14].
Endotoxin-induced en- dothelial ﬁbrosis is mediated through a process known as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in a similar way to that observed using the best-studied EndMT inducer, tumor growth factor β(TGF-β) [15–19]. Endothelial ﬁbrosis has been detected in septic ICU patients and in several animal septic models, and the pharmacological inhibition of endotoxemia-induced endothelial ﬁbrosis improves organ failure and survival [ 13,20,21].Endotoxemia-induced endothelial ﬁbrosis is characterized by a massive change in the endothelial gene-expression proﬁle, which downregulates endothelial markers, includ- ing vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1).
This change also strongly upregulates several other genes, in- cluding ﬁbrotic and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as the αsmooth muscle actin (α-SMA), ﬁbroblast-speciﬁc protein 1 (FSP-1), collagen type I and III (Col I/III), and ﬁbronectin (FN), as well as transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain- enhancer of activated B cells (NF- κB), Slug, and Twist. It also upregulates pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α(TNF-α), interleukin-1 β(IL-1β), and IL-6, as well as oxidative enzymes such as NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX), among several others [ 15,16,22–26].Endothelial ﬁbrosis has been associated with the origin and progression of several features of sepsis syndrome, including endothelial monolayer disruption, which promotes vascular hyperpermeability and edema formation, endothelial migration, refractory hypotension, pro-inﬂammatory cytokine production, MODS, and increased mortality [ 9,13,20,23,27–30].
It has been reported that speciﬁc nutrient consumption modulates sepsis. The di- etary intake of ω-3 fatty acids enhances survival in septic mice, improves sepsis-induced intestinal inﬂammation and oxidative stress injury, and reduces the mortality rate of sepsis- induced acute respiratory distress syndrome [ 31–33].Furthermore, dietary ascorbic acid decreases mortality and suppresses the inﬂammatory response to endotoxemia and sepsis, showing potential action on ECs [ 34,35].Moreover, polyphenolic antioxidant ﬂavonoid consumption improves endotoxemia and septic condition.Several types of ﬂavonoids improve MODS and increase survival against sepsis [ 36–38].The evidence suggests that the nutrient composition of food affects sepsis progression and its outcomes, but the molecular underlying mechanism has not been completely described.It has been reported that gene expression is modulated under inﬂammatory conditions by nutrient consumption.
The consumption of ω-3 fatty acids reduces inﬂammation by downregulating pro-inﬂammatory cytokines TNF- α, IL-1β, and IL-6 [ 39,40]. Ascorbic Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 659 3 of 22 acid has the capacity to modulate gene expression, including collagen and ﬁbronectin genes, in response to several stimuli, such as oxidative stress [ 41–44].Interestingly, ascor- bic acid regulates extracellular matrix production through collagen and ﬁbronectin gene expression [ 44,45].Furthermore, pro-inﬂammatory cytokine expression decreases as a consequence of ﬂavonoid supplementation [ 46].However, it is not known whether speciﬁc nutrient consumption modulates the ﬁbrotic endothelial gene-expression pattern during sepsis to inhibit sepsis-induced endothelial ﬁbrosis as a mechanism to decrease vascular endothelial hyperpermeability, hypotension, MODS, and mortality.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary supplements withω-3 fatty acids, ascorbic acid, and polyphenolic antioxidant ﬂavonoid on the mod- ulation of ﬁbrotic endothelial gene-expression patterns during sepsis and its effects on improving vascular hyperpermeability, hypotension, MODS, and mortality. 2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Animals, Dietary Supplement Administration, Endotoxemia Induction, and Parameter Recordings Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats weighing from 190 to 210 g were used.They were housed in cages with water and food ad libitum, a 12 h light/dark cycle, and 25±1◦C temperature.All experimental procedures in rats were approved by the Commission of Bioethics and Biosafety of Universidad Andres Bello (N◦002/2020) and following in- struction form the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Research Council and the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.This research complies with the commonly-accepted 3Rs.
Rats were treated with 0.9% NaCl saline solution (saline-treated condition) or with the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide from E. coli (LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), 10 mg/kg) (endotoxemia-treated condition) by intraperitoneal (I.P .) injection (50 µL), and animals were followed during the experiment.Saline-treated and endotoxemia-treated rats were subjected to dietary supplementation by means of a prophylactic (4 weeks before and during the 7 days of endotoxemia) and a therapeutic (only during the 7 days of endotoxemia) protocol.The period of prophylactic and therapeutic supplement treatments is compatible with those previously reported [ 31,47–49].Furthermore, the period for endotoxemia induction is similar to those reported by us and other groups [ 3,13,30,50–53].
The composition of the dietary supplementation was as follows: sham supplemen- tation (Sham): 2 mL water; ω-3 fatty acid supplementation ( ω-3 FA): 300 mg ω-3 FAs (Sigma-Aldrich) (composed by 180 mg EPA and 120 mg DHA in 1000 mg (1.075 mL) of ﬁsh oil); ascorbic acid supplementation (AsA): 600 mg of AsA (Sigma-Aldrich) (2 mL of 300 mg/mL AsA solution in water); ﬂavonoid supplementation (Flav): 6 mg of mixed ﬂavonols, ﬂavanones, isoﬂavones, ﬂavones, ﬂavan-3-ols, and anthocyanins, which were administered in a 2 mL of total solution (water or oil solvent) (all from Sigma-Aldrich). The dietary supplementation was administered daily by gavage.Twelve rats per group were used.Rat blood samples were collected in a sodium citrate or lithium heparin-containing blood collection Vacutainer®tube (Becton Dickinson Co., East Rutherford, NJ, USA) through tail-vein puncture or cardiac puncture after anesthetization.
The obtained blood was immediately centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4◦C to separate the plasma and immediately stored at −80◦C. Systolic blood pressure (P S) and heart rate (H R) were ac- quired with a physiological recording system and a pressure tail cuff for a noninvasive blood-pressure-recording system for rats (ML125/R), coupled with an MLT125/R pulse transducer (AD Instruments, Bella Vista, Australia).To perform the recordings of P Sand HR, animals were recorded for 1 min several times to obtain reliable values.All transducers were connected to a PowerLab®8/30 (AD Instruments), and physiological variables were instantaneously displayed through Chart®software (v6.1.1, AD Instruments).Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 659 4 of 22 2.2.Primary Rat Mesenteric Endothelial Cell (RMEC) Isolation and mRNA Expression Determination by RT-qPCR Primary rat mesenteric endothelial cells (RMECs) were isolated from the mesenteric artery.
The mesenteric artery was occluded on its distal end and cannulated from its proxi- mal end with a polyethylene tubing connected to a 21-gauge syringe. The mesentery was surgically removed and washed with sterile PBS.For the enzymatic isolation of RMECs, the mesenteric artery was slowly perfused in a culture hood for 5 min with 5 mL M-199 medium supplemented with 40 µL penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 U/mL/10,000 µg/mL), 20µL Fungizone (250 µg/mL), and 12.5 mg collagenase type II.The cell suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 7 min; the pellet was reconstituted in 3 mL M-199 medium supplemented with 8 mL/L of Pen/Strep (10,000 U/mL/10,000 µg/mL), 4 mL/L of Fungi- zone (250µg/mL), 10% FBS, and 10% CCS.Thereafter, RMECs were subjected immediately to mRNA expression determination.RT-qPCR experiments were performed to measure mRNA expression levels in RMECs.Total RNA was extracted with Trizol according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
DNAse I-treated RNA was used for reverse transcription using the Super Script II Kit (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of RNA were used as templates in each reaction.Quantitative-PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (AB Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).Assays were run using a RotorGene instrument (Corbet Research, Sydney, Australia).The determination of mRNA expression was normalized relative to 28S mRNA and were expressed relative to sham-supplemented condition.2.3.In Vivo Permeability Assay and MODS Determination At the end of experiments, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected with Evans blue dye (EBD (Sigma-Aldrich), 80 mg/kg, intravenous) for 10 min.EBD binds to plasma proteins and extravasates to tissue parenchyma at sites of increased vascular permeability.Then, rats were euthanized and perfused with saline solution via the left ventricle to wash excess EBD.
Mesentery, kidney, and liver were removed, washed in cold saline solution, gently dried using a paper towel, weighted, and prepared for EBD extraction. Briefly, organs were weighted and homogenized with 100% trichloroacetic acid in a 1:2 (mg:mL) proportion.Homogenates were centrifuged at 4180 ×gfor 30 min, and the supernatant optical density was determined spectrophotometrically at 630 nm.To assess MODS, plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine amino- transferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBIL), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were quantified to measure liver function; creatinine (CRE) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were quantified to measure kidney function; lactic acid (LAC) and glycemia (GLY) were quantified to measure metabolic function.
MODS markers were quantified using a Piccolo Xpress Chemistry Analyzer equipped with General Chemistry 13, MetLyte Plus CRP, and Basic Metabolic Panel Plus panels (Abaxis, Union City, CA, USA), according to the manufacturers’ instructions. 2.4.Statistical Analyses Differences were considered signiﬁcant at p< 0.05.Statistical differences were assessed by the Mann–Whitney U-test and one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) (or Kruskal–Walli’s type), followed by Dunn’s post hoc test and two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) followed by Tukey post hoc test.See the ﬁgure legends for the speciﬁc test used.Survival Kaplan–Meier curves were compared by the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test and the Gehan–Breslow–Wilcoxon test to determine survival rates.Contingency analyses with Fisher’s exact test were used to assess the relative risk of death.Statistical testing was two-sided and used the 5% signiﬁcance level.
The data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism version 9.4 (GraphPad Software, LLC, Boston, MA, USA). Samples used in the study were deﬁned to identify the mean magnitude effect of a ≥2-fold change with standard deviations of 10%.Accordingly, a sample size of 12 rats per group would provide 90% statistical power using a two-sided 0.05 signiﬁcance level.Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 659 5 of 22 3.Results 3.1.Impact in EndMT Gene Expression through Dietary Supplementation Based on ω-3 FA, Ascorbic Acid, or Polyphenolic Antioxidant Flavonoids in Endotoxemic Rats To determine the effects on EndMT-related gene expression and sepsis syndrome, rats were subjected to saline treatment or endotoxemia and fed with ω-3 fatty acid, ascorbic acid, or ﬂavonoid supplementation by means of a prophylactic protocol (4 weeks before and for 7 days of endotoxemia) or therapeutic protocol (only for the 7 days of endotoxemia) (Figure 1A).
Firstly, we established the change in endotoxemia-induced mRNA expression proﬁles for several selected genes involved in EndMT-mediated endothelial ﬁbrosis in endotoxemic rats. For this purpose, we analyzed the mesenteric endothelium expression proﬁle because it is a vascular network that frequently undergoes vascular disease asso- ciated with ﬁbrosis and regulates a relevant portion of total blood ﬂow.The mesentery is a vascular area that represents blood vessels in other tissues well.Thus, ECs from the mesentery are an appropriate model for studying dysfunctional endothelial changes and are useful as representatives of the endothelium from internal organs.Antioxidants 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 22 analyses with Fisher’s exact test were used to assess the relati ve risk of death.Statistical testing was two-sided and used the 5% signific ance level.The data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism version 9.4 (GraphPad Software, LLC, Boston, MA, USA).

For this purpos e, we analyzed the mesenteric endothelium expression profile because it is a vascular network that frequently undergoes vascular disease associated with fibrosis and regulates a relevant portion of total blood flow. The mesentery is a vascular area that represents blood vessels in other tissues well.Thus, ECs from the mesentery are an appropriate model for studying dysfunctional endothelial changes and are useful as representatives of the endothelium from internal organs.Figure 1.EndMT gene expression in endotoxemic rats.( A) Scheme of the strategy of saline– and endotoxemia–treated rats subjected to dietary suppl ementation by means of a prophylactic (4 weeks before and during the 7 days of endotoxemia) and a therapeutic (only during the 7 days of endotox- emia) protocol.Sham supplementation (Sham), ω–3 fatty acid supplementation ( ω–3 FA) , ascorbic acid supplementation (AsA), and fl avonoid supplementation (Flav).

Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 659 6 of 22 Primary rat mesenteric endothelial cells (RMECs) were extracted from the rats of all groups (see Figure 1A), and mRNA expression was immediately determined to avoid any possible cell transformation. The results showed that RMECs extracted from endotoxemia- treated rats of all groups exhibited decreased mRNA expression of the endothelial markers VE-Cadherin, PECAM-1, von Willebrand Factor (vWF), and collagen type IV (Col IV) compared to saline-treated rats.However, endotoxemic rats showed increased mRNA expression of the ﬁbrotic and ECM markers alpha smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA), smooth muscle protein 22 alpha (SM22 α), FSP-1, Col I, Col III, and FN.Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of the EndMT inducers IL-1 β, IL-6, TNF-α, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), and transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGF- β2) were also increased in endo- toxemic rats.
The mRNA expression of the cytokine receptors IL-1R, IL-6R, TNFR, and TβRI were also increased in endotoxemic rats, while T βRI did not show changes compared to saline-treated rats. All transcription factors tested (NF- κB, Smad4, Slug, Twist, Snail, and Zeb-1) showed increased mRNA expression in endotoxemic rats.In addition, mRNA expression of NOX-2 from the endotoxemic condition was increased, whereas mRNA expression of NOX-1 and NOX-4 did not show changes compared to saline-treated rats (Figure 1B).The survival percentage of the endotoxemic rats was 25% after 7 days of endotoxemia challenge (Figure 1C).Interestingly, the endotoxemic rats fed with a diet supplemented with ω-3 fatty acid following the therapeutic and prophylactic protocols showed a reduced decrease in mRNA expression of the endothelial markers (Figure 2A,B, left panels).
Furthermore, the ω-3 fatty acid-supplemented endotoxemic rats in the therapeutic and prophylactic protocols showed a reduced increase in mRNA expression of the ﬁbrotic and ECM markers, EndMT inducers, cytokine receptors, transcription factors, and NOX-2 enzyme compared with saline-treated rats (Figure 2A,B, middle and right panels). Notably, the ω-3 fatty acid-supplemented endotoxemic rats in the therapeutic and prophylactic protocol showed a non-signiﬁcant change in mRNA expression of several EndMT-related genes compared with saline-treated rats (Figure 2A,B), suggesting that the ω-3 fatty acid supplementation efﬁciently abolished the endotoxemia-induced change in the EndMT expression proﬁle.Similar results were obtained when the supplementation with ascorbic acid (AsA) was used (Figure 2C,D).
However, because the non-signiﬁcant change was almost not detected, it is suggested that AsA supplementation has a minor impact on EndMT-related mRNA expression compared withω-3 fatty acid supplementation. Furthermore, similar results to those observed with ω-3 fatty acid supplementation were obtained when the supplementation with ﬂavonoids was assessed (Figure 2E,F).How- ever, a non-signiﬁcant change in mRNA expression was observed in only the prophylactic treatment of ﬂavonoid supplementation.These results indicate that predominantly in the prophylactic protocol, the ω-3 fatty acid and ﬂavonoid supplementation exhibited similar and strong protection against the endotoxemia-induced EndMT gene-expression change.Notably, the survival percentages in the endotoxemic rats fed with a diet supple- mented with ω-3 fatty acid in the therapeutic and prophylactic protocol were 50% and 83%, respectively, (Figure 2G,H, respectively).
This shows protection against endotoxemia compared with the sham-supplemented endotoxemic rats after 7 days of endotoxemic challenge. Supplementation with AsA produced a modest increase in survival (25% to 33%) in only the prophylactic treatment, whereas the therapeutic treatment showed the same sur- vival percentage as that observed in the sham-supplemented endotoxemic rats ( Figure 2I,J , respectively).Importantly, the survival percentages in the ﬂavonoid-supplemented endo- toxemic rats in the therapeutic and prophylactic protocols were 33% and 50%, respectively, after 7 days of endotoxemia challenge (Figure 2K,L, respectively).This shows protec- tion against endotoxemia compared with the sham-supplemented endotoxemic rats after 7 days of endotoxemic challenge.These results indicated that principally, the ω-3fatty acid and flavonoid supplementation produced protection against mortality induced by endotoxemia.

Considering this, we tested whether the consumption of a diet supplemented withω-3 fatty acid, ascorbic acid, or ﬂavonoids is able to improve endotoxemia-induced vascular hyperpermeability. To this end, blood vessel hyperpermeability was tested in the mesentery and in two additional relevant organs that are severely affected during sepsis: the liver and the kidney.This was performed using endotoxemic rats by means of the Evans blue dye (EBD) permeability assay.The mesentery, liver, and kidney extracted from sham-treated endotoxemic rats showed increased EBD accumulation, which indicates that blood vessels leaked to the interstitial compartment in contrast with saline-treated rats (Figure 3A–C, left panel).Inter- estingly, theω-3 fatty acid-supplemented endotoxemic rats in the therapeutic protocol and notably in the prophylactic protocol showed a strong decrease in the endotoxemia-induced hyperpermeability in the mesentery, liver, and kidney (Figure 3A–C, middle left panel).
AsA-supplemented endotoxemic rats showed decreased endotoxemia-induced hyperper- meability in the mesentery and liver, but not in the kidney (Figure 3A–C, middle right panel) with the prophylactic protocol. The therapeutic protocol did not show any change in endotoxemia-induced hyperpermeability in all tested organs.The ﬂavonoid-supplemented endotoxemic rats in only the prophylactic protocol showed decreased endotoxemia-induced hyperpermeability in all tested organs (Figure 3A–C, right panel).Antioxidants 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 22 Figure 3.Effects in vascular hyperpermeability through dietary supplementation based on ω-3 FA, ascorbic acid, or polyphenolic an tioxidant flavonoids in endotoxemi c rats.

During endotoxemia, vascular hyperpermeability is associated with changes in EndMT gene expression, so correlation analyses were performed between these two fac- tors. The results showed that in the endotoxemi c condition, the increased permeability in the mesentery (Supplementary Table S1), liv er (Supplementary Table S2), and kidney (Supplementary Table S3) correlates with the ch ange in mRNA expression of most of the EndMT-related genes tested in Figure 2.Intere stingly, in all tested organs, VE-Cadherin, α-SMA, Col III, TNF- α, and NF- κB showed correlation coefficients (r2) and p-values ( p) higher than 0.8 and 0.01, respectively.The ex pression of these genes at the protein level was verified and showed concordant results compared to those shown in the mRNA de- termination (Supplementary Figure S1).
Interestingly, higher changes in mRNA expression of VE-Cad, α-SMA, Col III, TNF- α, and NF- κB were found mainly in the non-surviv ing endotoxemic rats compared to sur- vivors, as observed in the sham group (Figure 4A–E, left panel, respectively).

Furthermore, the BUN/creatinine ratio, which is an indicator of kidney disease risk, was increased in sham-supplemented endotoxemic rats (Figure 7G, left panel) but was limited in the ω-3 fatty acid-supplemented endotoxemic rats in the therapeutic and prophylactic protocols (Figure 7G, middle left panel).

These results indicate that ω-3 fatty acid supplementation and, to a minor extent, ﬂavonoid supplementation are able to preserve organ function during endotoxemia. 3.5.Impact on Survival and Risk of Death through Dietary Supplementation Based on ω-3 FA, Ascorbic Acid, or Polyphenolic Antioxidant Flavonoids in Endotoxemic Rats To determine whether the consumption of a diet supplemented with ω-3 fatty acid, ascorbic acid, or ﬂavonoids is able to improve survival and risk of death in endotoxemic rats, we analyzed survival curves and contingency analysis.Theω-3 fatty acid-supplemented endotoxemic rats in the therapeutic and prophylactic protocols showed a signiﬁcant difference compared with the endotoxemia-treated rats, as indicated by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test (Figure 8A).
To give more weight to deaths at early time points, the Gehan–Breslow–Wilcoxon test was performed, which also showed that theω-3 fatty acid-supplemented endotoxemic rats in the therapeutic and prophylactic protocols had an increased death incidence (Figure 8A).

Results are expressed as the mean ±95% conﬁdence interval (CI) NS: non-signiﬁcant ( N= 12). 4.Discussion The ﬁnding that nutrition can regulate gene expression in healthy and diseased states has been widely studied.Studies have shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids regulate the expression of several genes, including DNA-binding proteins, nutrient-sensitive tran- scription factors including NF- κB, ROS regulation enzymes, transporters, cell adhesion, and proliferation, among several others [ 55–58].Furthermore, an antioxidant-rich diet also shows modulation of the gene expression in healthy and diseased conditions depending on the antioxidant type used and the oxidative status of the tissues [ 59–61].Consumption of vitamins C, D, and E also regulates gene expression in several cell types, including immune cells, astrocytes, and osteoblasts [ 62–65].Inﬂammation-related genes are also differentially expressed in response to a low-calorie diet [66].
Speciﬁc nutrient consumption has been associated with gene expression during sepsis and other inﬂammatory conditions, thus impacting the sepsis outcome. It has been reported that consumption of ω-3 fatty acid reduces expression levels of genes involved in inﬂamma- tion [ 39,40,67].Interestingly, the intake of ω-3 fatty acid regulates the expression of genes involved in membrane architecture that modify intracellular signaling [ 68].The beneﬁcial effects ofω-3 fatty acids are principally promoted by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).Treatment with EPA or DHA reduces monounsaturated fatty acids and increases the polyunsaturated fatty acids in primary myometrial and leiomyoma cells [ 68].The present study used ﬁsh oil containing a combination of EPA and DHA, which had a concentration of 30% relative to the total volume.This natural concentration was effective in improving the outcomes of endotoxemia in rats in this study.
This ﬁnding opens broad therapeutic possibilities to use higher concentrations of EPA and DHA during sepsis, but further studies are needed to explore this issue. Notably, therapeutical actions ofω-3 fatty acids can be applied and even potentiated by combining them with vitamins, antioxidants, and other elements to alleviate several pathological conditions [ 69,70].There is evidence of a beneﬁcial effect of a combination of statins and ω-3 fatty acids on platelet function and other hemostatic mechanisms, as well as the inhibition of the inﬂammatory process.However, a combined treatment of statins and ω-3 fatty acid on sepsis has not been evaluated yet [ 71], so further experiments are needed to study this possibility.Di- Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 659 16 of 22 etary supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids also improves survival against sepsis and its complications [ 31–33].
Dietaryω-3 fatty acids increase the survival of Staphylococcus aureus -induced sepsis by reversing the deleterious effect of a high-saturated-fat diet [ 72]. Acute pancreatitis may cause systemic inﬂammatory response syndrome, organ failure, and death.The intake of ω-3 fatty acids decreases the risk of organ failure in patients with acute pancreatitis [ 73].Dietaryω-3 fatty acids reduced mortality and decreased prostaglandin E 2production in Kupffer cells in a rat model of sepsis [ 74].Ascorbic acid has the capacity to modulate gene expression in response to several stimuli, such has oxidative stress [ 41–43].Interestingly, ascorbic acid induces collagen gene expression in human ﬁbroblasts [ 44].Congruently, ascorbic acid is postulated as a key mediator of the extracellular matrix production in trabecular meshwork cells in the eye, mediating the expression of collagen type I, ﬁbronectin, and laminin [ 45].
Dietary ascorbic acid shows beneﬁcial actions against endotoxemia and sepsis [ 34,35]. In polymicrobial sepsis, ascorbic acid regulates hepatic vasoregulatory gene expression and reduces hepatic microvascular dysfunction [ 75].Interestingly, a phase I trial of intravenous ascorbic acid infusion in patients with severe sepsis showed a positive impact on multiple organ failure, reduced proinﬂammation biomarkers, and attenuation of vascular endothelial injury [ 76].Notably, monocytes challenged with endotoxin and treated with ascorbic acid showed decreased proinﬂammatory cytokine production [ 77].Similar results showed protection against sepsis and acute lung injury associated with sepsis by means of a decrease in the proinﬂam- matory response, improved alveolar ﬂuid clearance, and prevention of sepsis-associated coagulation malfunctions [ 78].
A polymicrobial sepsis study showed that ascorbic acid infu- sion diminishes oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, modulates hepatic vasoregulatory gene expression, and decreases hepatic microvascular dysfunction [75]. A diet containing ascorbic acid combined with hydrocortisone and thiamine improves sepsis features and consequences [ 79].The utilization of combined hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine therapy appears to be safe and provides potential beneﬁts for the management of sepsis and septic shock, but some aspects remain controversial since their actions seem to be modest in decreasing mortality [ 80–82].The consumption of polyphenolic antioxidant ﬂavonoids regulates gene expression.The intake of some ﬂavonoids such as resveratrol and epicatechins has been shown to regulate the gene expression of proteins involved in insulin secretion from β-cells and glucose transport and insulin signaling in adipocytes [ 83,84].
Supplementation with the ﬂavonoid epicatechin modulates gene-expression proﬁles of immune cells in humans [ 85]. The ﬂavonoid polyphenol quercetin upregulates neuron gene expression [ 86].The ﬂavonoid rhamnetin decreases organ failure in Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in mice [ 87].Similarly, the ﬂavonoids luteolin and icariin increase sur- vival against polymicrobial sepsis [ 36,37].The dietary ﬂavonoid ﬁsetin extracted from berries protects against polymicrobial sepsis-induced inﬂammatory response and multiple organ dysfunction [ 38].The ﬂavonoid acacetin exerts protection against sepsis [ 88].Oral consumption of the ﬂavonoid kaempferol showed decreased acute lung injury in polymi- crobial sepsis [ 89].Considering that a combination of several of these ﬂavonoids was used in this study, a massive amount of work remains to clarify the individual contributions of each type of ﬂavonoid in sepsis-induced EndMT gene expression and the deleterious outcomes of sepsis.
Importantly, we evaluated the action of dietary supplementation on the expression changes induced by endotoxemia in the mesenterial endothelium because it is a relevant vascular region to study ﬁbrosis and pathological conditions linked to ﬁbrosis [ 90–92]. Moreover, ECs from the mesentery are a suitable and interesting model for studying dysfunctional endothelial changes [93,94].During sepsis, endothelial dysfunction emerges as a main factor to generate MODS.The endothelium regulates vascular functions such as vascular reactivity, hemostasis, and vascular permeability [ 95].During sepsis, endothelial permeability is increased and pro- duces vascular leakage to the interstitium, generating edema [ 20,29,50,96].In edema forma- tion, blood volume into the vasculature decreases and produces severe hypotension, which increases the risk of death [ 20,27,51,97].
Hypotension damages microvascular perfusion Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 659 17 of 22 and generates massive MODS, which increases mortality and the risk of death [ 96,98,99]. Thus, the endotoxic-induced EndMT that triggers the endothelial gene-expression proﬁle promotes the decreased expression of the endothelial adhesion proteins and the upregula- tion of the ﬁbrotic and ECM proteins.This disrupts the endothelial architecture, contributes to the endothelial hyperpermeability, and causes MODS.Endothelial ﬁbrosis has been detected in septic ICU patients, and the expression changes of VE cadherin have emerged as an accurate diagnostic tool.In endotoxemic rats, the pharmacological inhibition of endotoxemia-induced endothelial ﬁbrosis improves MODS and survival [13,20,21].The prophylactic and the therapeutic experimental models are both valuable in a clini- cal context.
ICU patients not affected by sepsis are at risk of undergoing sepsis because ICU non-septic patients often progress into sepsis or septic shock. Prophylactic treatment could be useful in the prevention of the adverse effects of nosocomial infections, such as catheter- induced urinary tract infections, intra-hospital acquired pneumonia, skin infections (mainly in burn patients), bloodstream infections, and surgery-induced infections [ 100,101].Enteral nutrition can prevent catabolic states observed in critical illness as well as in intestinal villi atrophy, apoptosis of enterocytes, dysbiosis, and alterations of immune function in the gut [ 102,103].Conversely, ω-3 fatty acid supplementation or ﬁsh oil nutrition has been used via parenteral nutrition in the septic subject, improving sepsis outcomes [104–106] .Further studies are needed to determine the most effective path of administration for each supplement against sepsis.
Sepsis syndrome is the main cause of death in ICU patients, and the current therapy is unsatisfactory. Thus, the results demonstrating that nutrient supplementation inhibited endotoxemia-induced endothelial ﬁbrosis, hypotension, MODS, and mortality during endotoxemia are of great importance.Therefore, speciﬁc nutrient consumption could be a therapeutic alternative against deleterious effects of sepsis and other endothelial ﬁbrosis-mediated pathologies.5.Conclusions Our results indicate that the consumption of supplements based on ω-3 fatty acids, ascorbic acid, and polyphenolic antioxidant flavonoids can decrease the endotoxemia- induced gene-expression change associated with endothelial fibrosis.
Furthermore, endotoxemia-induced mortality was decreased by the consumption of supplements based onω-3 fatty acids, mainly via prophylactic ingestion as well as in therapeutic usage, and by the consumption of polyphenolic antioxidant ﬂavonoids by means of prophylactic ingestion, while the consumption of supplement of ascorbic acid showed no signiﬁcant difference. Thus, our ﬁndings indicated that speciﬁc nutrient consumption improves sepsis outcomes and should be considered in treatment against sepsis and other systemic inﬂammatory diseases.
