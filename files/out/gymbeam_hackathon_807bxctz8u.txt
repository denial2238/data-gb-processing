Abstract: Atriplex dimorphostegia (Saltbush) is an annual halophytic shrub that is widely distributed across various parts of Asia. The current study is the ﬁrst to report the metabolites proﬁle of the total ethanol extract of the aerial parts of A.
dimorphostegia (TEAD), and its anabolic activity together with the isolated 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) in orchidectomized male rats. TEAD was analyzed and standardized utilizing UPLC-PDA-ESI–MS/MS and UPLC-PDA-UV techniques, resulting in tentative identiﬁcation of ﬁfty compounds including polyphenols, steroids and triterpenoids.In addition, 20-HE was quantiﬁed, representing 26.79 µg/mg of the extract.Phytochemical investi- gation of TEAD resulted in the isolation of 20-HE from the ethyl acetate fraction (EFAD) and was identiﬁed by conventional spectroscopic methods of analysis.Furthermore, the anabolic effect of the isolated 20-HE and TEAD was then evaluated using in silico and in vivo models.Molecular docking experiments revealed in vitro selectivity of 20-HE towards estrogen receptors (ERs), speciﬁcally ER β over ER αand androgenic receptor (AR).
The anabolic efﬁcacy of TEAD and 20-HE was studied in orchidectomized immature male Wistar rats using the weight of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. The weights of ventral prostate and seminal vesicles were used as indicators for androgenic activity.Rats administered 20-HE and TEAD showed a signiﬁcant increase ( p= 0.0006 and p< 0.0001) in the net muscle mass compared to the negative control, while the group receiving TEAD showed the highest percentage among all groups at p< 0.0001.Histopathological investigation of skeletal muscle ﬁbers showed normal morphological structures, and the group administered 20-HE showed an increase in cross sectional area of muscle ﬁbers comparable to methandienone and testosterone groups at p> 0.99.A.dimorphostegia exhibited promising anabolic activity with minimal androgenic side effects.Keywords: Atriplex dimorphostegia ; 20-hydroxyecdysone; LC–MS-MS; molecular docking; anabolic activity 1.
Introduction Since the discovery of testosterone in 1935, many derivatives have been synthesized to prolong its biological activity, rendering them orally active and developing products referred to as anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) with maximum anabolic effects and mini- mum androgenic side effects [ 1]. Although AAS therapy has been associated with treating muscle contusion injury, hypogonadism and other chronic diseases such as cachexia, they are very common among recreational athletes [ 2,3].Their prolonged administration, how- ever, have been associated with a negative impact on fertility in both sexes related to the strong androgenic 5- α-dihydrotestosterone effect [3,4].Plants 2023 ,12, 206.https://doi.org/10.3390/plants12010206 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants Plants 2023 ,12, 206 2 of 27 Interestingly, ecdysteroids, a class of hormones found in arthropods responsible for molting and reproduction, have shown anabolic effects in vertebrates and humans [ 5–7].
When compared to AAS, ecdysteroids do not bind to androgenic receptors (ARs). This is possibly because they affect the signal transduction pathway via membrane bound recep- tors such as estrogen receptors (ERs) and increase protein synthesis in skeletal muscles [ 6,8].ERs are ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor family [ 9].There are two ER subclasses, ER alpha (ER α) and ER beta (ER β), with different tissue distribution and expression levels.ERs are not limited to reproductive organs; they are also involved in other biological activities in almost all mammalian tissues and organs [ 10] ERαis expressed primarily in reproductive tissues, while ER βis mainly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, vascular endothelial cells, and the prostate [ 11].Both ER αand ER β are expressed in skeletal muscles of mice and humans [ 10,12–14].
Accumulating evidence showed that selective activation of ER βpotently induces regeneration and ﬁbrogenesis in toxin-injured muscle in female rats [15]. Phytoecdysteroids are the plant derived analogues of ecdysteroids, possessing a 14- α-hydroxy-7-en-6-one chromophore and a 27–29 carbon skeleton [ 16] Ecdysteroids have been discovered in more than 100 plant families [ 17].The compound 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) was identiﬁed with a structure identical to that isolated from insects [ 18].The pharmacological effects of ecdysteroids on mammals have been investigated by monitoring body weight, organ and muscle weight after intraperitoneal administration, and the most widely investigated ecdysteroid was 20-HE due to its low acute toxicity [8,19].20-HE was isolated from several members of genus Atriplex belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae [ 20–24].
The Atriplex genus comprises about 300 species of herbs and shrubs that grow throughout subtropical areas of the world, with the majority growing in saline soils and hence the name saltbush [ 23]. Several species of Atriplex including A.halimus, A.lindleyi, A.laciniata, A.confertifolia and A.leucoclada were investigated for their antidiabetic, antioxidant, antiplasmodial, anticholinesterse, cytotoxic and antifungal effects [ 24–29].However, according to the literature, a few studies of Atriplex dimorphostegia var.Kar.& Kir were reported [30,31] A.dimorphostegia is an annual, 15–30 cm tall herb with grey-green, succulent leaves growing in various parts of Asia [ 32].A.dimorphostegia aerial parts have not undergone comprehensive phytochemical studies.Considering the cited studies, nothing was found in the literature reporting the metabolic proﬁle of A.dimorphostegia aerial parts responsi- ble for its anabolic potential.
Thus, the present study aimed at metabolites proﬁling and standardization of the ethanol extract of A. dimorphostegia aerial parts (TEAD) adopting UPLC-PDA and UPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS techniques.In addition, the isolation and struc- tural elucidation of the anabolic ecdysteroid 20-HE from the ethyl acetate fraction (EFAD) ofA.dimorphostegia is conducted for the ﬁrst time.Molecular modeling experiments were conducted to support that estrogen receptor (ER) binding, rather than androgen receptor (AR) binding, mediates the anabolic effect of 20-HE.Moreover, in vivo assessment of the anabolic and androgenic activities of the TEAD and the isolated 20-HE was applied in orchidectomized male rats.2.Results 2.1.Extraction and Fractionation of A.dimorphostegia This study aimed to prepare a standardized ethanol extract of the aerial parts of A.dimorphostegia (TEAD).This included extraction, fractionation and standardization.
TEAD was fractionated using solvents of increased polarity n-hexane followed by ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate fraction (EFAD) was used to isolate a pure sample of 20-HE [ 33].The n-hexane fraction was isolated ﬁrst as a step in the puriﬁcation and extraction of relatively non-polar components.Plants 2023 ,12, 206 3 of 27 2.2.Identiﬁcation of 20-HE Isolated from EFAD Phytochemical investigation of the EFAD led to the isolation and identiﬁcation of 20-HE as a white crystalline solid (Figure 1) (55 mg, mp.237.5–239.5◦C) [34].The purity of the compound was elucidated by HPLC and was found to be 99.5% [ 35].The1H NMR (400 MHz) spectrum recorded in DMSO d-6 showed ﬁve methyl groups at δH 0.74 (3H, s, H-18), 0.89 (3H, s, H-19), 1.22 (3H, s, H-21 and 3H, s, H-26) and 1.25 (3H, s, H-27), as well as a set of methylene group signals between δH1.00 to δH 2.00, the ethylenic proton H-7 at δH 5.82 (1H, d, J = 2.2 Hz) and 3 CH-OH ( δH 3.8), typical of the 20-HE skeleton.
This was further conﬁrmed by the13C NMR spectrum which showed three O-bonded quaternary carbons ( δC 71.3; 77.9; 85.2) and the presence of α,β-unsaturated ketone ( δC 122.1; 168.0; 206.5) (Table 1) [ 36]. Finally, using the ESI-MS in positive mode showed a peak at m/z481.243 corresponding to a [M+H]+molecular ion.A molecular formula of C 27H44O7related to 20-HE was then deduced and conﬁrmed according to the literature [36–39] .Further, the1H and13C NMR spectral data were closely related to those reported to the 5 βisomer of 20-HE [ 40].This compound was used as a standard reference for the standardization of TEAD.Table 1.1H- and13C-NMR assignment of 20-HE.

portulacoides [36] Compound 1was identiﬁed as caffeoyl-hexose-deoxyhexoside with a parent ion at m/z487.01, showing MS2ions at m/z308 due to the loss of caffeic acid moiety, and at m/z 179 due to the expulsion of deoxyhexose and hexose moieties [ 42]. Compound 2was identi- ﬁed with a [M−H]−ion at m/z451.12 showing fragmentation peaks at m/z353, indicating the presence of caffeoyl-quinic acid or chlorogenic acid.The peak at m/z191 is due to quinic acid and was identiﬁed as an unknown chlorogenic acid derivative [ 43,44].Compound 3, with a molecular ion peak at m/z448.2 and exhibiting typical fragmentation patterns of C-glycosides, was assigned isoorientin [ 45,46].Compound 4with a molecular ion peak [M−H]−atm/z593.4 and fragment ions at m/z353 [(M−H)−(120+120)]−and at m/z383 [(M−H)−(90+120)]−indicates apigenin and two hexose moieties [ 45,47].
Compound 5 showed a parent ion [M −H]−atm/z417.01 and an MS2fragment ion at m/z255 ([M−H- glucose]−, liquiritigenin), and was assigned liquiritin [ 43,44].

In Silico Modelling of Steroid Receptor Binding The docked pose of 20-HE in the binding site of ER βreveals a binding mode similar to that of the co-crystallized ligand, estradiol. The inhibitor occupies the hydrophobic central cavity of the binding pocket.The inhibitor is then anchored to the binding pocket via an array of hydrogen bonds.The cyclic end of the inhibitor is hydrogen bonded to the side chain of Arg346 and the backbone carbonyl of Leu339.Although the hydroxyl group of 20-HE occupies a virtually nearly identical position in space as the hydroxyl group of estradiol, it forms hydrogen bonds to different residues.The estradiol hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the side chain of Glu305.Extending to the opposite side of the binding cavity, the aliphatic chain of 20-HE also contains a hydroxyl group that occupies a very similar position to that of the other hydroxyl group of estradiol.This hydroxyl group hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl of Gly472.
Overall, the positioning of 20-HE is very similar to that of estradiol in the binding cavity of ER β(Figures 3 and 4). Looking at the binding modes of 20-HE in the cavity of ER αand AR immediately points out a critical determinant for selectivity towards ER β(Figure 5).The cyclic end of 20- HE clashes with the side chain of Glu52.The aliphatic chain of the ligand clashes extensively with the side chains of His524 and Leu525.This clashing is governed by the secondary hydroxyl group and the terminal tertiary hydroxyl group (Figure 6).This suggests that despite the absence contribution of the extensive hydroxylation of the aliphatic chain of 20-HE to its binding to ER β, the presence of these groups govern its selective binding Plants 2023 ,12, 206 9 of 27 towards ER βover ER αindirectly.Similarly, extensive clashing with the binding site of AR inhibits 20-HE binding to AR.The ketone group of the ligand clashes with the side chain of Met780.
The aliphatic chain of the ligand clashes extensively with the side chains of Gln711 and Arg752. Similar to the case of ER β, the secondary hydroxyl group and the terminal methyl group of the ligand aliphatic chain are responsible for the ligand clashes, in addition to the methyl group of the C1 position of the aliphatic chain.Plants 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 29 (a) (b) Figure 2.Cont.Plants 2023 ,12, 206 10 of 27 Plants 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 29 (c) Figure 2.Standardization of TEAD: ( a) HPLC chromatogram of TEAD at 213 nm.( b) UPLC chro- matogram of the isolated 20-HE.( c) Calibration curve of the isolated 20-HE.2.5.In Silico Modelling of Steroid Receptor Binding The docked pose of 20-HE in the binding site of ER β reveals a binding mode similar to that of the co-crystallized ligand, estradio l.The inhibitor occupi es the hydrophobic cen- tral cavity of the binding pocket.The inhibitor is then anchored to the binding pocket via an array of hydrogen bonds.

The C1 methyl group of the aliphatic chain of the ligand is of specific interest. It is responsible for additional clashing with the side chain of Gln711 of AR.However, it is also responsible for the only steric cl ash in the binding pose of 20-HE to ER β with the carbonyl of Gly472 at 2.75 Å.Therefore, al though this group pote ntially contributes to selectivity towards ER β, its elimination might be advantageous as it would increase the y = 0.1248x + 1.1292 R² = 0.9892 024681012 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0Area under the peak (mAu) Concentration ( μg/mL) …20-HE at 213 nm Figure 2.Standardization of TEAD: ( a) HPLC chromatogram of TEAD at 213 nm.( b) UPLC chro- matogram of the isolated 20-HE.( c) Calibration curve of the isolated 20-HE.Plants 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 29 binding stability of the ligand to ER β.Its contribution in steric clashes with the side chain of both ER β and AR suggests that the elimination of this would still conserve selectivity towards ER β.

The group receiving methandienone had the highest anabolic ratios (27.92 and 8.79), showing a significant dif- ference when compared to the negative control at p values of 0.001 and 0.01, respectively.The group receiving testosterone showed the lo west ratios (1.01 and 1.07), significantly different from the methandienone group at p values of <0.0001 and 0.0005, respectively.The muscle bundle to prostate and seminal vesicles ratio showed a significant differ- ence in the group receiving TEAD when compared to the negative control and testos- terone groups at p values of 0.002 and <0.0001 respectively.

Plants 2023 ,12, 206 18 of 27 3.Discussion The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the anabolic effect of A.dimorphostegia .TEAD was found to contain 20-HE (26.79 µg/mg), a phytoecdysteroid that was proven to have low acute toxicity [ 8] and an anabolic potency that have been well documented [ 6,7,19,76].Several steroids have been employed in treating various mus- cle injuries and chronic diseases, as well as among athletes [ 2,3,16].However, the negative impact of AAS on fertility in both sexes presents ecdysteroids as an alternative for AAS due to their anabolic potency with minimal androgenic side effects [8].The UPLC-PDA-MS/MS proﬁling of TEAD highlighted the presence of a range of metabolites including polyphenols, phenolic acids, ﬂavonoid glycosides and aglycones.
Examples include coumaroyl hydroxy-palmitic acid, quercetin galloyl pentoside, acetylated kaempferol hexoxyl-rhamnoside and quercetin rhamnoside. In addition to 20-HE as the major identiﬁed compound, sterols, steroids and triterpenoids such as β-sitosterol, stigmas- terol and β/α-amyrin were also identiﬁed.This comes in context with previous reports which refers to the occurrence of different types of polyphenols and steroids previously identiﬁed from different Atriplex species [ 36,43,45,49,50,67,73].However, the current study is the ﬁrst to report these compounds in A.dimorphostegia .Several studies reported that polyphenols such as apigenin quercetin and phenolic acids are highly effective in attenuating muscle atrophy and enhancing muscle health.Apigenin reduced oxidative stress and inhibited hyperactive autophagy and apoptosis, alleviating age-related skeletal muscle atrophy in rats [ 77,78].Kanzaki et al.
[ 79] reported that quercetin glycosides increased the wet weights of the quadratus femoris, gastroc- nemius, tibialis anterior and soleus muscles in mice. While in the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles of rats, ferulic acid increased the production of mechano-growth factor and the antioxidant enzymes [ 80].Moreover, Ommati et al.[ 81] proved that chlorogenic acid improved muscular strength in resistance-trained rats through improving mitochondrial activity and cellular energy metabolism.Phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, according to Verma et al., by having an activity similar to that of 5- α-reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to 5- α-dihydrotestosterone, may be involved in the reported anabolic effect in the form of weight gain and muscle mass [ 82].
Moreover, ursolic acid was found to reduce muscle atrophy and stimulate muscle hypertrophy in mice by enhancing skeletal muscle insulin/IGF-I signaling and inhibiting atrophy-associated skeletal muscle mRNA expression [83]. To understand the practical in vitro selectivity pattern of 20-HE towards ER βover ERαand the AR, molecular docking experiments were conducted using all three receptors.In these experiments, the protein data bank (PDB) entries 3OLL, 3UUD and 2AM9 were used for ER β, ERαand AR, respectively [ 84–86].These crystal structures were speciﬁcally selected as they are in ligand-bound states and therefore their conformations would allow ligand docking into the ligand-binding site.The docked poses of 20-HE revealed that the steric clashes negatively inﬂuence the binding stability of 20-HE in the binding sites of ER α and AR, and indirectly improve selectivity towards ER β.
These ﬁndings were in agreement with previous studies [8,87] The anabolic efﬁcacy of TEAD and the isolated 20-HE was evaluated using testosterone enanthate and methandienone as positive controls in orchidectomized immature male Wistar rats [ 6]. The groups administered 20-HE and TEAD showed a signiﬁcant increase (p= 0.0006 and p< 0.0001) in the net mass of muscles compared to the negative control, while the group receiving the TEAD showed the highest percentage (0.64%) among all groups.T óth et al.proved that 20-HE increased ﬁber cross-sectional area in the regenerating soleus muscle, suggesting a beneﬁcial effect on muscle regeneration without exhibiting the androgenic effects of steroids [ 19].The anabolic to androgenic ratio of groups receiving 20-HE and TEAD is very comparable to methandienone ( p> 0.99).An effect even exceeding methandienone was found in vitro [6], and Chermnykh et al.reported that ecdysterone showed an anabolic effect stronger than that of methandienone [ 76].
A 10-week intervention study performed on young men investigated the effect of ecdysterone on human sport Plants 2023 ,12, 206 19 of 27 exercise. A signiﬁcant increase in muscle mass was observed without an increase in biomarkers for liver or kidney toxicity [7].It could be concluded that TEAD is a potential anabolic agent containing 20-HE together with other secondary metabolites which previously reported to have anabolic effects and activities that promote muscle health [ 7,73–78].Moreover, the preparation of a standardized extract of TEAD with potential anabolic activity is of low cost, is time saving and is a simple method compared to the isolation of pure 20-HE [ 88] Furthermore, TEAD and 20-HE did not affect the cell viability of SkMC with IC 50(>100 µg/mL).4.Materials and Methods 4.1.Materials The aerial parts of A.dimorphostegia Kar.& Kir were harvested from Wadi Al-Hilali, Arar-Dammam International North Road (50 km from Arar) in March 2018.
The position from which the plant was harvested was determined using the global positioning system having coordinates 30◦49′47.6′′N 41◦14′44.1′′E. The plant collected was identiﬁed by Prof.Dr.Ahmed K.Othman, Biology Department, Faculty of Science, Northern Border University, Saudi Arabia.Plant material was then air-dried at room temperature and reduced to a ﬁne powder.A voucher specimen was placed at the herbarium (PHG-P-AM- 245) at the Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Egypt.All solvents were of analytical grade, while those used in the preparative HPLC, and UPLC/PDA/ESI/MS assays were of HPLC grade.Methandienone and testosterone enanthate were obtained from Novector labs (East, Maharashtra, India).4.2.Extraction and Fractionation of A.dimorphostegia Two kilograms of the air-dried A.dimorphostegia aerial parts were extracted by macer- ation in 5 L of absolute ethanol for 24 h at room temperature, followed by ﬁltration.
The same process was repeated for four more days until exhaustion. The extracts were collected and dried under reduced pressure at 45◦C yielding 100 g residue.Ten grams of the dried alcohol extract was reserved for further analysis, labeled as TEAD and freeze-dried.The remaining 90 g of the dried extract was suspended in 500 mL distilled water.Fractionation was carried out successively using solvents of increasing polarities: n-hexane followed by ethyl acetate.Each fraction was dried completely under reduced pressure to yield n-hexane (38 g) and ethyl acetate (14 g) residues, respectively.The residues were then freeze-dried for further investigations.4.3.Isolation of 20-HE from EFAD EFAD was subjected to column chromatography.EFAD (4 g) was dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water and chromatographed over a 160 g Diaion HP-20 (Merck, Germany) column (2.5×100 cm).
Fractions were eluted using water and methanol (H 2O: MeOH): 0–100% step-gradient with an increment of 20% methanol every 1000 mL. The column was ﬂushed with 200 mL of 100% methanol for the last three fractions.Elution was monitored using TLC and (DCM: MeOH) (9:1) as the mobile phase.Eluents from 0–40%, 60–80% and 100% methanol were pooled into fractions 1, 2 and 3, respectively.Fraction 2 (60–80%) was further reﬁned using column chromatography.The fraction weighing 1 g was dissolved in 5 mL DCM and chromatographed using 50 g Silica gel 60 (Merck, Germany) column (1.5×100 cm).DCM and MeOH were used as eluents with a ratio of 9.5:0.5.Elution was monitored using TLC in a solvent system of DCM and MeOH (9:1).Fractions 101–153 showed a single green band after spraying with p-anisaldehyde/H 2SO4, suggesting the presence of triterpenoid skeleton.Thus, it was pooled and dried under reduced pressure at 45◦C, yielding 55 mg white crystalline solid.4.4.
NMR Spectrometrical Analysis of 20-HE NMR spectra were conducted using a Bruker Avance 400 MHz NMR spectrometer using DMSO- d6as a solvent. One-dimensional1H and13C spectra were obtained using Plants 2023 ,12, 206 20 of 27 standard pulse sequences and parameters.1H chemical shifts ( δ) were measured in ppm, relative to TMS and13C NMR chemical shifts to DMSO- d6, and were converted to the TMS scale by adding 39.49.4.5.LC/ESI/MS Spectrometrical Analysis of 20-HE LC-ESI-MS spectrometrical analysis of 20-HE Waters ™ACQUITY Xevo ™TQD sys- tem (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA).A C 18column with dimensions of 2.1 mm×50 mm , 1.7µm (Waters, Ireland) was used.20-HE was dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 100 µg/mL, then ﬁltered using a 0.2 micropore ﬁlter.A gradient elution program was conducted using eluent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and eluent B (0.1% formic acid in methanol).The total run time was 32 min and a ﬂow rate was kept at 0.2 mL/min.
For mass spectrometric detection, a XEVO TQD triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electro-spray ionization (ESI) source (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) was used. Mass spectra were detected in the ESI between m/z100–1000.The peaks and spectra were processed using the Maslynx 4.1 software (Waters, Milford, MA, USA).4.6.UPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS Analysis of TEAD The proﬁling of TEAD was performed on a Waters ™ACQUITY Xevo ™TQD system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA).A C 18column with dimensions of 100 mm ×2.1 mm (p.s., 1.7 µm) (Waters, Ireland) was used.The sample was dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 1 mg/mL and was then ﬁltered using a 0.2 µm micropore ﬁlter.The instrument settings and the gradient elution program were conducted using the method described earlier by El Zahar et al.using eluent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and eluent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) [ 89].The ﬂow rate was kept at 200 µL/min with an injection volume of 10 µL.4.7.
Standardisation of TEAD Using UPLC Analysis Chromatographic analysis of alcohol extract was performed using an UPLC system Thermo Fisher UHPLC Dionex Ultimate 3000 (Germering, Germany). The system is equipped with a (ISO-3100SD) pump, (WPS 3000 SL) autosampler, (TCC-3000SD) column thermostat and (DAD-3000 RS) diode array detector (Germering, Germany).The software used was Chromeleon 6.8 (Germering; Germany).A column of Hypersil Gold was used with a 5 µm particle size and dimensions of 250 ×4.6 mm.The solvents used were 1% orthophosphoric acid in water (A) and acetonitrile (B).The separation was performed for a total of 70 min using gradient elution from 10% to 75% B in A for the ﬁrst 35 min at a ﬂow rate 0.5 mL/min, and then increased to 0.8 mL/min for the whole run.Then, the elution went from 75% to 100% B in A for 15 min and was kept isocratic for another 15 min.For the next 15 min, the elution was from 100% to 40% B in A and for the last 10 min kept isocratic from 10% B in A.
UV detection was at 213 nm, column temperature at 30◦C and the injection volume was 20 µL. The isolated 20-HE (1 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL methanol, serial dilutions were performed using ﬁve concentrations (1, 10, 20, 40 and 80 µg/mL) and a calibration curve was generated using the same method [90].4.8.In Silico Modelling of Steroid Receptor Binding The molecular docking experiments were carried out using protein crystal structures obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [ 91].The structures used were 3OLL, 3UUD and 2AM9 for ER β, ERαand AR, respectively [ 84–86].The PDB structures were prepared using the Dock Prep protocol embedded in Chimera [ 92].The docked ligands were prepared using the same protocol.Molecular docking was then carried out using the AutoDock Vina extension in Chimera [ 93].A docking grid was generated with dimensions 25 ×25×25 Å for all the docking experiments.
The position of the docking grid center is ( −26, 25,−12), (20, 7, 5) and (27, 3, 5) for ER β, ERαand AR, respectively, using an (x, y, z) format. A default exhaustiveness value of 8 and an energy range of 3 kcal/mol were used for generating binding poses.The resulting poses were evaluated using Maestro Visualizer (Maestro, Plants 2023 ,12, 206 21 of 27 Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA, 2021) and ﬁgures and graphics were generated using the same software.To validate the docking protocol, the co-crystallized ligands were re-docked using the same docking parameters.The generated docking poses were identical to the co-crystallized poses for ER β, ERαand AR with RMSD values of 0.508, 0.643 and 0.751, respectively.This indicates a valid docking protocol.4.9.Evaluation of the Cytotoxic Activity of 20-HE and TEAD (SRB-U Assay) The human skeletal muscle cell line was cultivated as adherent cultures on Petri dishes and kept at 37◦C.
The SRB-U assay was used to assess cell viability [ 94,95] Three independent experiments with three internal replicates were performed. All data were blank adjusted prior to further interpretation.4.10.In Vivo Anabolic Study 4.10.1.Animals Handling of animals and experimental design were approved and conducted ac- cording to the guidelines of the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Pharmacy, British University in Egypt, Cairo.(Approval No.EX-2217).Twenty-ﬁve immature (21 days old) male Wistar rats weighing approximately 60 g were obtained from Nile Co.for Pharmaceutical and Chemical Industries, Cairo, Egypt.Animals were housed in a temperature-controlled environment at 25◦C with alternating 12 h light and dark cycles.They were kept on a standard diet and water ad libitum.4.10.2.Orchidectomy Orchidectomy was performed using the technique described earlier [ 1].
General anesthesia was performed with the association of Ketamine (120 mg/kg) and Xylazine (16 mg/kg) administered in the same syringe as 1.0 mL. The rat was restrained in dorsal recumbency, and the surrounding scrotal area was prepared for aseptic surgery.Using a scalpel blade, a 1 cm incision was made through the skin ventrally on both sides of the scrotum.The testis was then explored and retracted to expose a section of the vas deferens and the spermatic cord’s vasculature, ligated, then tied in an overhand knot.The cord was then excised, and the process was repeated on the other side.Finally, muscle and skin closure was performed with two stitches using synthetic absorbable sutures and then observed for a few hours for signs of hemorrhage.Rats were then left to recover for one week; two rats died at days 2 and 5.4.10.3.
Experimental Design Twenty-three rats with an average weight of 62.25 ±10.26 g were randomly divided into ﬁve groups and treated with test compounds by gavage and subcutaneous (SC) injection (Figure 16). Group A received only the vehicle (20% ethanol and 80% corn oil).Groups B to E received methandienone, testosterone enanthate, 20-HE and TEAD with concentrations of 5 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 185 mg/kg, respectively, each diluted in a solution of 20% ethanol and 80% corn oil.The rats were administered once daily with the respective substances for ten consecutive days.4.10.4.Sample Collection On day 10, rats were killed by cervical dislocation.The seminal vesicles (S.vesicles), ventral prostate and levator ani were dissected out and weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg.The seminal vesicles were squeezed before weighing to remove any ﬂuids.
The soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were then dissected together as a bundle (muscle bundle) from the right and left hind limb of rats, weighed immediately and then stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 72 h for further investigation.

Then, 4 μm thick cross sections were cut by rotatory microtome.The sections were stained with Harris hematoxylin and eosin as a gene ral tissue examination staining method.All methods of tissue samples processing and staining were as outlined before [96].Nine ran-dom non-overlapping fiel ds per sample tissue section were analyzed for determination of muscle fibers cross sectional area.All data and micrographs were obtained by using a Full HD microscopic camera operated by the Leica application module for tissue sections anal-ysis (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Germany, Berlin).4.10.6.
Statistical Analysis All statistical calculations and generation of graphs and the cumulative data of weight gain in rats, secondary sex organs and muscle fibers, as well as the muscle fiber’s cross-sectional area, were compared by using the t-test for unpaired samples and one-way ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey–Kramer as a post hoc test. All tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.00.The data are expressed as means ± SD.5.Conclusions The Atriplex dimorphostegia total ethanol extract proved anabolic potency.This was represented by the increase in net muscle mass of gastrocnemius and soleus muscle, as well as an increase in the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers.Moreover, both 20-HE and Figure 16.The scheme of experimental design for the study of the effect of 20-HE and total alcoholic extract on muscle ﬁbers and secondary sex organs.4.10.5.

Then, 4 µm thick cross sections were cut by rotatory microtome.The sections were stained with Harris hematoxylin and eosin as a general tissue examination staining method.All methods of tissue samples processing and staining were as outlined before [ 96].Nine random non-overlapping ﬁelds per sample tissue section were analyzed for determination of muscle ﬁbers cross sectional area.All data and micrographs were obtained by using a Full HD microscopic camera operated by the Leica application module for tissue sections analysis (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Germany, Berlin).4.10.6.
Statistical Analysis All statistical calculations and generation of graphs and the cumulative data of weight gain in rats, secondary sex organs and muscle ﬁbers, as well as the muscle ﬁber’s cross- sectional area, were compared by using the t-test for unpaired samples and one-way ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey–Kramer as a post hoc test. All tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.00.The data are expressed as means ±SD.5.Conclusions The Atriplex dimorphostegia total ethanol extract proved anabolic potency.This was represented by the increase in net muscle mass of gastrocnemius and soleus muscle, as well as an increase in the cross-sectional area of muscle ﬁbers.Moreover, both 20-HE and TEAD exhibited a low androgenic effect on sex organs without increasing the weights of prostate and seminal vesicles of rats after administration for ten consecutive days.These ﬁndings indicate that A.
dimorphostegia is a promising candidate for use as an anabolic agent and warrants further clinical investigation. Moreover, future study of the pharmacokinetics of TEAD and 2-HE in rats, as well as the lifespan, biodistribution, and muscle tissue retention, will be conducted to evaluate the biological effects of indicated doses.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, A.N.B.S., M.M.E., N.S., I.M.A.and E.Z.; methodology, A.N.B.S., M.M.E., N.S., I.M.A., E.Z.and H.H.; validation, A.N.B.S., M.M.E., N.S., I.M.A.and E.Z.; investigation, N.S.and E.Z.; formal analysis, M.M.E., N.S., E.Z.and H.H.; writing—original draft, E.Z.; supervision, A.N.B.S., M.M.E., N.S.and I.M.A.; writing—review and editing, A.N.B.S., M.M.E., N.S., I.M.A.and E.Z.All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.Plants 2023 ,12, 206 23 of 27 Funding: This research received no external funding.
