Each participant completed a question-naire to determine vitamin D intake through supplementa-tion and sun exposure, as well as the existence of factorsimpacting vitamin D status. Vitamin D de ﬁciency was de- ﬁned as 25(OH)D levels less than 30 ng/mL.Logistic regres- sion analyses were used to examine the predictors ofvitamin D de ﬁciency.In the vitamin D de ﬁciency prediction model, odds ratios (OR) were converted into simple scores.The sensitivity, speci ﬁcity, and positive and negative pre- dictive values of the different cutoffs in the total risk scorewere calculated and used to establish the optimum cutofffor those at high risk of vitamin D de ﬁciency.Internal val- idation on this model was carried out using a bootstrap re-sampling method of 1000.Results: Sixty percent of participants had vitamin D de ﬁciency.
The ﬁnal model (n=488) for the prediction of vitamin D de ﬁciency consisted of BMI ≥25 kg/m 2[OR 1.15, 95% con ﬁdence interval(CI) 0.99-2.30), no exercise (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.02-2.49), exercise1-2 times/week (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.79-2.46), sunlight expos-ure<15 minutes/day (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.04-2.78), no vita- min D supplementation (OR 8.76, 95% CI 5.02-15.28), andvitamin D supplementation ≤20,000 IU/day (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.34-3.96). The area under the curve was 0.747.At a cutoff of 6.6 in total risk score (range 4-13.6), the modelpredicted vitamin D de ﬁciency with a sensitivity of 71.9 and a speci ﬁcity of 65.3.The internal validation by Bootstrap re- vealed a ROC of 0.752 (95%CI 0.751-0.754).Conclusions: In women at risk of osteoporosis, a simple questionnairecan uncover variables related to vitamin D de ﬁciency.
The risk score might be used in clinical practice to identify indi-viduals who could bene ﬁt from vitamin D supplementation without requiring 25(OH)D levels to be measured.However, external validation in a different cohort is re- quired before implementation.
