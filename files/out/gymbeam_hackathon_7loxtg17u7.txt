This pathogen is capable of surviving desiccation and produces protective compounds such as podophyllic polysaccharides and yellow carotenoids (6, 7).C.sakazakii is a pathogenic bacterium that poses a signi ﬁcant threat to both humans and animals by colonizing the gastrointestinal tract.Infection with C.sakazakii can lead to severe health complications, including neonatal meningitis, necrot- izing colitis, and infections in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly (8 –10).The ability of C.
sakazakii to traverse human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) through transcytosis is particularly critical for the development of neonatal meningitis (11).

sakazakii promotes in ﬂammation and apoptosis, which are likely involved in the pathogenesis of neonatal meningitis. Finally, the disruption of monolayer tightjunctions by C.sakazakii further facilitates bacterial translocation.Infant and neonatal cases of C.sakazakii infection, particularly in neonatal intensive care units, have been linked to meningitis in newborns, which can result in high mortal-ity rates (14 –16).The bacterium ’s strong pathogenicity has garnered signi ﬁcant attention from researchers, resulting in the isolation and identi ﬁcation of multiple strains (17 –19).While some pathogenic factors have been identi ﬁe d ,s u c ha se n t e r o t o x i n s( 2 0 ) ,o u t e rm e m - brane protein A (21, 22), and type IV and type VI secretory systems (23), the pathogenicity of C.sakazakii is not yet well understood compared to other common pathogenic bacteria like Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes (24, 25).
Recent advances in genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic technologies have provided potential avenues for identifying virulence factors that can be targeted for the development of new antibiotics (11, 19, 26). In this study, we propose the use of comparative proteomicproﬁling of wild type (WT) strains and strains with knockouts of genes related to virulence to identify genes essential for the successful pathogenesis of C.sakazakii (27–29).Previous research has shown that knocking out the plasmid pESA3 weakened virulence (28, 30) whileknocking out treR increased virulence (31) in C.sakazakii .Based on this knowledge, we hypothesized that genes encoding proteins downregulated by pESA3 knockout and upreg- ulated by treRknockout could potentially be genes essential for successful pathogenesis.
Using this method, we successfully identi ﬁedpdxY , encoding a pyridoxal kinase involved in the biosynthesis of pyridoxal 5 9-phosphate (PLP), as a gene essential for the successful pathogenesis of C. sakazakii .Our data suggest that the pdxY gene is a promising candidate for the development of new antimicrobial treatments.Further investigations are warrantedto determine whether a pdxY knockout strain could be exploited for vaccine development.Overall, our study sheds light on the fundamental importance of vitamin B 6recycling for the survival and virulence of C.sakazakii .RESULTS Impact of treR and pESA3 knockouts on C.sakazakii virulence.Using a suicide p l a s m i dm e t h o d( 3 2 ) ,w es u c c e s s f u l l yk n o c k e do u tt h e treR gene markerlessly and elimi- nated the pESA3 plasmid from the wild-type (WT) strain using a previously reported plas- mid-curing method (28).Subsequently, we evaluated the virulence of C.
sakazakii strains with treRand pESA3 knockouts in a rat model. The treRknockout strains showed increased virulence, while the pESA3 knockout strain exhibited weaker virulence than the wild-typestrain (Fig.1).These ﬁndings suggest that both pESA3 and TreR are involved in regulating the virulence of C.sakazakii .The underlying mechanism of this regulation may be attributed to their direct effects or their in ﬂuence on the expression of other genes.Comparative proteomic pro ﬁling to identify proteins related to virulence.We hypothesize that knocking out treR and pESA3 affects bacterial virulence through the FIG 1 Virulence of the pESA3 plasmid-cured mutant and the treR deletion mutant.(A) Rat pup survival within 120 h after oral infection with WT, DpESA3, and DpESA3 complemented strains.

To identify potential virulence factors regulated by pESA3 and TreR, we conducted a comparative proteomics analysis and iden- tiﬁed 1,447 proteins.The abundances of proteins varied signi ﬁcantly among the samples, with pESA3 knockout resulting in a notable increase in 52 proteins and a decrease in 83proteins (Fig.2A), while treR knockout led to a signi ﬁcant increase in 37 proteins and a decrease in 57 proteins (Fig.2B).
We performed a Venn diagram analysis and identi ﬁed only one protein, pyridoxal kinase, encoded by pdxY , that was downregulated by pESA3 knockout and upregulated by treRk n o c k o u t( F i g .2 C ) .T h e r e f o r e ,P d x Ym a ys e r v ea sav i r u l e n c e factor regulated by both pESA3 and treR. ADpdxY mutant exhibited impaired growth without vitamer supplementation.To ascertain the role of pyridoxal kinase in C.sakazakii , we attempted to generate a pdxY knockout strain but encountered dif ﬁculties.Considering the signi ﬁcance of pyridoxal kinase in the vitamin B 6metabolic pathway, we speculated that the failure to generate the pdxY knockout strain might be due to the growth disadvantage of the strain, resulting in a low pro-portion of mutant colonies during the selection process using the suicide-plasmid-mediated FIG 2 Proteomic analysis of the pESA3 plasmid-cured mutant and the treR deletion mutant.

To overcome this hurdle, we supplemented the bacterial culture medium during the gene knockout processwith pyridoxal 5 9-phosphate, leading to the successful generation of the DpdxY strain. Subsequently, we investigated the impact of different vitamers on the growth rate of theDpdxY strain (Fig.3A).We observed that the addition of pyridoxine and pyridoxal to LB medium did not enhance the growth of the DpdxY strain.However, supplementation of LB medium with pyridoxamine, pyridoxine 5 9-phosphate, pyridoxal 5 9-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5 9-phosphate signi ﬁcantly improved the growth rate of the DpdxY strain com- pared to the growth rate in LB medium without vitamers.Further analysis using growth curve experiments revealed that the DpdxY mutant grew at a signi ﬁcantly lower rate than the wild-type strain in LB medium without additional vitamin B 6vitamers.However, when pyridoxal 5 9-phosphate was added, the growth defect of the DpdxY strain was partially restored (Fig.3B).
Essential role of pdxY in the virulence of C. sakazakii .It has been established that the deoxyxylose 5 9-phosphate (DXP)-independent vitamin B6biosynthesis pathway in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is crucial for virulence.In this study, we aimed to determine the role of pyridoxal kinase in the virulence of Cronobacter sakazakii using a rat oral infection model.Three groups of 3-day-old rats were orally infected with WT, DpdxY ,a n d DpdxY com- plemented strains of C.sakazakii , and their survival was monitored over 5 days.Our results revealed that rats infected with the WT or the DpdxY complemented strain displayed an onset of death at 24 h, with 90% of the animals perishing by 72 h.On the other hand, rats infected with the DpdxY strain showed a delayed onset of death at 48 h, with 90% of them surviving for at least 5 days postinfection.The survival curve (Fig.4A) clearly demonstrated a signi ﬁcant difference between the DpdxY and WT strains.
Furthermore, we examined the impact of pdxY onC. sakazakii colonization in mice.The bacterial loads in the blood, liver, and spleen of rats infected with the DpdxY strain were signiﬁcantly lower than those in rats infected with the WT strain, as depicted in Fig.4B to D, respectively.These results highlight the crucial role of pyridoxal kinase in the virulence and colonization of C.sakazakii .Our study underscores the potential of targeting the DXP-in- dependent vitamin B6biosynthesis pathway as a promising therapeutic strategy against C.sakazakii infections.DISCUSSION A proteomics approach has been developed by us to discover essential genes involved in the pathogenesis of C.sakazakii .Through this method, one potential virulence factor was FIG 3 Growth of the pdxY knockout mutant in LB medium and LB medium supplemented with vitamin B6vitamers.

The pdxY gene encodes pyridoxal kinase, which is involved in the vitamin B6recycling pathway (33 –35). In Escherichia coli , the presence of two pyridoxal kinases, PdxK and PdxY, contributes to the recycling of pyridoxal phosphate.However, during our investigation usingBLAST, we were unable to ﬁnd a gene homologous to pdxK inC.sakazakii .T h i s ﬁnding leads us to speculate that pdxY could be the sole gene responsible for the pyridoxal phosphate recycling process in C.sakazakii ,t h e r e b yr e a f ﬁrming the signi ﬁcance of pdxY in this bacte- rium.To further explore this hypothesis, we performed a global sequence alignment and discovered a 78% similarity between the nucleotide sequences of PdxY in C.sakazakii ATCC BAA-894 and Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 (data not shown).This substantial match indi- cates the conservation of the pdxY sequence across different genera, underscoring its pivotal role in the pyridoxal phosphate cycling pathway.
Consequently, our ﬁndings provide addi- tional evidence supporting the importance of pdxY in the PLP recycling mechanism. Vitamin B 6serves as an essential cofactor for many enzymes in both prokaryotic and eu- karyotic organisms (36 –38).Notably, the importance of the vitamin B6biosynthesis pathway in the virulence of various human pathogens has been discovered (39 –41).In Streptococcus pneumoniae ,d i s r u p t i n gt h ev i t a m i nB6biosynthesis pathway resulted in signi ﬁcant attenua- tion in a chinchilla middle ear infection model and minor attenuation in a mouse pneumo- nia model (42).Similarly, disrupting the pyridoxal 5 9-phosphate biosynthesis pathway in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae resulted in reduced colonization and attenuated virulence in the BALB/c mouse model (43).The signi ﬁcance of the vitamin B6biosynthesis pathway in plant pathogens has also been demonstrated, with Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
oryzae mutants containing mutations in pdxA and pdxJ exhibiting signi ﬁcantly reduced virulence in rice (40). These results highlight the conservation and signi ﬁcance of the vitamin B6biosynthesis pathway in pathogen virulence in both animals and plants.Our ﬁndings suggest that the FIG 4 Virulence of the pdxY knockout mutant.(A) Survival of rat pups during the 120-h period following oral infection with WT, DpdxY , and DpdxY complemented strains.Combined data from three independent experiments are shown ( *,P,0.05 by a log rank test).(B to D) CFU present in the blood, liver, and spleen of infected rats at 24 h postinfection.Blood was collected from the facial vein, and theliver and spleen were harvested and homogenized in ice-cold PBS for use in colony enumeration.Role of pdxY in Virulence of Cronobacter sakazakii Applied and Environmental Microbiology August 2023 Volume 89 Issue 8 10.1128/aem.00924-23 5 vitamin B6recycling pathway is crucial for pathogen virulence (44, 45).
Interestingly, in C. sakazakii , there are also PdxJ, PdxB, and PdxH, which are involved in vitamin B6synthesis.PdxH catalyzes the oxidation of either pyridoxine 5 9-phosphate or pyridoxamine 5 9-phosphate to pyridoxal 5 9-phosphate.This may explain why the pdxY knockout strain is able to grow well when supplemented with pyridoxine 5 9-phosphate or pyridoxamine 5 9-phosphate, similar to the growth observed with pyridoxal 5 9-phosphate supplementation (Fig.3A).However, the impact of these vitamin B6synthesis enzymes on the virulence of C.sakazakii requires further investigation.It was found that many pathogens require vitamin B6for their normal physiological functions.For example, the removal of exogenous vitamin B6in a Pdx1 (Rv2606c) mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during exponential growth resulted in the death of the bacte- rium (44, 46).Similarly, a DpdxR mutant of Streptococcus pneumoniae and mutants contain- ing mutations in pdxA and pdxJ ofXanthomonas oryzae pv.
oryzae were fully auxotrophic for vitamin B6(40, 42). These results suggest that vitamin B6is a common physiological need for many pathogens, including C.sakazakii , which is capable of acquiring exogenous vitamin B6 to meet its requirements.However, our in vivo experiments showed that a DpdxY mutant of C.sakazakii exhibited weaker virulence, suggesting that the bacterium may not be able to obtain suf ﬁcient vitamin B6from animal hosts.Animals cannot synthesize vitamin B6and rely on dietary sources for this essential nutrient (47, 48).The estimation of the concentration of vitamin B6in animals is through the concentration of pyridoxal 5 9-phosphate (PLP) in the blood plasma (49 –51).The concentra- tion of vitamin B6in humans ranges from 20 to 120 nM, and that in mice ranges from 100 to 200 nM (52, 53), depending on nutritional and epidemiological factors.
However, the con- centration of PLP in mouse plasma is insuf ﬁcient to support the optimal growth of several pathogens, including the Dpdx1 mutant of M. tuberculosis (54).Moreover, phosphorylated PLP is unlikely to serve as a vitamin B6source for the C.sakazakii DpdxY mutant in vitro due to low permeability through biological membranes (55).Our in vivo toxicity experiments demonstrated that the C.sakazakii DpdxY mutant exhibits weak virulence, suggesting that the deletion of the pdxY gene and the subsequent deﬁciency in vitamin B6synthesis cannot be compensated for by acquiring it from the host.The mutant ’s weakened virulence and conditional growth make it a promising candidate for attenuated vaccines.Additionally, targeting PdxY in the vitamin B6recycling pathway could be a promising strategy for antibiotic development against C.sakazakii .In summary, our study underscores the critical role of vitamin B6recycling in the survival and virulence of C.
sakazakii , offering a potential avenue for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and plasmids.All bacterial strains and plasmids utilized in this study are listed in Table 1, and the corresponding primers are listed in Table 2.The bacterial samples were stored in cryovials containing LB medium (Solarbio, China) supplemented with 15% glycerol (Solarbio, China) at 280°C.Prior to experimenta- tion, the bacterial strains were activated by being cultured overnight in LB medium.Gene cloning and transfor-mation of C.sakazakii were conducted using standard techniques.The pCVD442 suicide vector (Miaoling, China) was prepared using E.coli S17-1 lpir(Weidi, China).In cases where necessary, antibiotics (ampicillin or kanamycin) were added to a ﬁnal concentration of 100 mg/mL (Solarbio, China).Curing of pESA3 and complementation.A DNA segment from the plasmid pESA3 was speci ﬁcally ampli ﬁed using primers DpESA3 -F and DpESA3 -R.
The ampli ﬁed pESA3 plasmid segment was then fused and circularized with the linearized plasmid pCVD442 using a recombinant kit (Vazyme, China). The resultingcircularized plasmid was subsequently ampli ﬁed using S17-1 lpircompetent cells (Weidi, China) and electro- porated into C.sakazakii ATCC BAA-894.Transformants that underwent plasmid recombination were selected using antibiotics, and plasmid-cured strains were selected using LB agar plates containing 20% sucrose.Thehybrid plasmid resulting from recombination was isolated and introduced into a plasmid-cured strain to gener- ate a complementation strain lacking the pESA3 plasmid.Rat virulence assay.The previously described method was used to conduct C.sakazakii infection in rats.The survival of the animals during the 5-day period after infection was monitored at speci ﬁct i m ei n t e r - vals.To assess bacterial infection in the animals, the rats were euthanized at 24 h postinfection.
The organs of the rats were retrieved and homogenized in precooled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with steel beads, fol-lowed by serial dilution and plating of the homogenates onto LB agar plates. The bacterial load was deter- mined by performing colony counting after 24 h of incubation on the LB agar plates.Protein extraction and digestion.The bacterial suspension was subjected to centrifugation and washed with PBS buffer to remove the original culture medium components.Subsequently, the bacterialRole of pdxY in Virulence of Cronobacter sakazakii Applied and Environmental Microbiology August 2023 Volume 89 Issue 8 10.1128/aem.00924-23 6 cells were lysed using ultrasonic waves until the bacterial suspension became clear.The resulting supernatant was then puri ﬁed by passage through a 0.22- mmm i c r o p o r o u s ﬁlter after centrifugation at 21,000 /C2gfor 15 min at 4°C.
For proteomics analysis, the protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid(BCA) assay kit, and 50 mg of protein was denatured by the addition of 8 M urea (Aladdin, China) to bring the total volume to 100 mL. The sample was then reduced by the addition of 1 mL of 200 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Aladdin, China) and incubated for 30 min at 60°C to break the disul ﬁde bonds of the protein.The sample was then cooled, 1 mL of 500 mM iodoacetamide (Aladdin, China) was added, and the mixture was shaken for 30 min in the absence of light to alkylate the cysteine residues of the protein.Finally, the sample was digestedovernight at 37°C using 2 mg of recombinant trypsin (Thermo, USA).Digestion was stopped by the addition of 10% tri ﬂuoroacetic acid (Aladdin, China) to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.4%.Subsequently, the samples were desalted using a C18solid phase extraction cartridge (Millipore, USA) and dried under a vacuum before being submitted for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.
Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The digested peptide samples were subjected to proteomic analysis using a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer.
