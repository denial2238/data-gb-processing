Ginger has numerous chemical compounds, such as phenolic constituents, volatile compounds (VOCs), and polysaccharides [ 2]. Among them, VOCs are considered one of the effective compounds in ginger due to their functional properties, including anti-in ﬂammatory, antioxidant, and analgesic [ 3].Ginger has four different degrees of processed products, including fresh ginger (SJ), dried ginger (GJ), baked ginger (PJ), and ginger charcoal (JT), and they have different types and contents of VOCs [ 4].However, the processing process of ginger is dif ﬁcult to control as the identi ﬁcation of different degrees of processed ginger mainly depends on the subjective evaluation of the pharmacists, such as appearance color, shape, and texture [ 4].Compared with subjective evaluation, instrument analysis is more objective and accurate.
In this study, headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) and machine learning are employed to analyze VOCs and discriminate different degrees of processedginger. We commenced by collecting different batches of SJ and making different degrees of processed ginger according to China pharmacopoeia 2020 Edition.The authenticity of these samples was evaluated by traditional Chinese medicine experts.The VOCsfrom different degrees of processed ginger were analyzed by HS- GC-IMS.The analytical conditions are recorded in Table S1 .A total of eighty VOCs were identi ﬁed in the different degrees of processed ginger ( Table S2 ).The abbreviation of VOCs is shown in Table S3 .The 3D chromatograms and the top view of GC-IMS 3D chro- matograms of VOCs in different degrees of processed ginger are shown in Figs.S1A and B , respectively.The heatmap of different degrees of processed ginger was formed based on the peak signal in the top view of 3D chromatograms.As shown in Fig.
1 , some aldehydes and esters were mainly divided in the blue box, and the higher content of these compounds indicated that they are primarily present in SJ. Some alcohols and acids were mainly divided in the purple box, and the higher content of these compounds indicated that they are primarily present in GJ.The above results may be caused by the oxidation of chemical com- pounds at high temperatures, wherein more aldehyde compounds are oxidized into acid compounds.Some alcohols, ketones and het- erocyclic compounds were mainly divided in the green box, and the higher content of these compounds suggested that they are pri- marily present in PJ.The above results can be attributed to theMaillard reaction due to the ketones are the products of the frag- mentation of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in the second stage of the Maillard reaction [ 5].
Some esters and ketones were mainly divided in the pink box, and the higher content of these compounds sug- gested that they are primarily present in JT. In a word, the oxidation and Maillard reaction may occur in the stir-frying process of ginger.Additionally, the principal component analysis (PCA) is per- formed in this work to further understand the differences in the VOCs of different degrees of processed ginger ( Fig.S1C ).The result of the classi ﬁcation distance suggested that PJ and JT were close to each other, which could be attributed to the bias between subjec- tive judgment results and actual results (subjectively mistaking PJ for JT).Moreover, the classi ﬁcation distance between SJ and other groups was the furthest, which might be related to the types and content of VOCs.Subsequently, machine learning algorithms were used to screen indicator compounds and to quickly discriminate different gingerPeer review under responsibility of Xi ’an Jiaotong University.

S2D , a total of nine indicator compounds were screened, and their content in different degrees of processed ginger was different, which suggested that these indicator compounds could be used for training machine learning models ( Figs. S2E and S3 ).Secondly, as shown in Table S4 , based on the screened indicator compounds, ten machine learning algorithms were used to predict different degrees of processed ginger.Machine learning algorithms can predict four possible results: true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN).
Predicted results including precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy are calculated to evaluate model performance based on the number of predicted outcomes in each of the four categories, as de ﬁned by the following formulas: Precision ¼TP TPþFP Recall ¼TP TPþFN F1 score ¼2TP 2TPþFPþFN Accuracy ¼TPþTN TPþTNþFPþFN Before analysis, the data are divided into training set and testing set by random sampling process in a ratio of 8:2 ( Table S5 ). Then, four performance metrics, namely precision, recall, F1 score, andaccuracy, were assessed ( Table S6 ).The accuracy of all machine learning algorithms was over 0.91, indicating that they all had good classi ﬁcation ability.Additionally, most machine learning models had good performance in classifying SJ and GJ.
The top three ma- chine learning algorithms (support vector machine with the linear kernel (SVM-L), logistic regression (LR) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)) achieved high prediction accuracy due to their mathematical properties. Meanwhile, SVM-L tended to have a simpler decision boundary, which could make it easier to interpretand implement in practical applications.LR was a linear model that provides coef ﬁcients associated with each feature, allowing for easy interpretation.QDA required relatively few computational re- sources for training and prediction.Therefore, the in ﬂuence of factors such as model complexity, interpretability and required computational resources were considered, these models were well- suited for developing a prediction model to classify the different degrees of processed ginger.As shown in Fig.S4 , the confusion matrix was displayed.
The results of these machine learning algo- rithms showed satisfactory classi ﬁcation results, whereas some misclassi ﬁcations occurred between PJ and JT in the confusion matrix. The results of these machine learning models were acceptable and they could be applied in the prediction of different degrees of processed ginger.Finally, the testing set was used to verify the predicted ability of these models.The confusion matrix of the predicted results for these models in the testing set is shown in Fig.S5 .Similarly, some misclassi ﬁcations also occurred between PJ and JT in the confusion matrix, which could be attributed to misclassi ﬁcation of the model for PJ and JT in the training set, leading to misclassi ﬁcation of the model for PJ and JT in the testing set.More data might be needed to assist the model in predicting these two classes and optimize the model.
Furthermore, another reason was that PJ and JT were very similar in some features, which were not obvious and were dif ﬁcult to distinguish. This behavior could be explained by the results of PCA.The accuracy of models in testing set is listed in Table 1 .The SVM-L, LR, and QDA also showed high accuracy.These behaviors indicated that these machine learning models had high stability, reliability, and reproducibility, making them suitable for different degrees of processed ginger.In summary, this study identi ﬁed different degrees of pro- cessed ginger based on HS-GC-IMS and machine learning.A total of eighty VOCs were identi ﬁed using HS-GC-IMS.Among them, nine VOCs, such as hydroxyacetone and 2-hexanol, were regarded as indicator compounds.Additionally, based on the nine indicator compounds, ten machine learning models for identi ﬁcation of processed degrees showed good prediction ability.
Among them, SVM-L, LR and QDA models can accurately identify different de- grees of processed ginger, with accuracies of 0.9412, 0.9706, and 0.9412 in testing set, respectively. Meanwhile, these models showed many advantages, such as easy interpretation, low model complexity and few computational resources.Overall, three Fig.1.The heatmap of volatile compounds (VOCs) in the different degrees of processed ginger.S.Liu, H.Dong, M.Zhang et al.Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis 14 (2024) 149 e151 150 models, including SVM-L, LR and QDA, had obvious potential ap- plications in the identi ﬁcation of different degrees of processed ginger.Meanwhile, the HS-GC-IMS combined with machine learning offers a simple, quick, and low-cost strategy for discriminating different degrees of processed ginger.
