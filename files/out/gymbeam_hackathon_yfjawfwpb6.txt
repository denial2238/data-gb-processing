In th is study, hypoallergenic whey protein hydrolyate (HWPH) was prepared by decomposing β-LG and α-LA of WP using exo- and endo-type proteases.
The enzyme mixing ratio and reaction conditions were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). Degrad ation of α-LA and β- LG was confirmed through gel electrophoresis, and digestion, an d absorption rate, and immunostimulatory response were measured using in vitro and in vivo systems.Through RSM analysis, the optimal hydrolysis conditions for degradation o f α - L A a n d β - L G included a 1:1 mixture of Alcalase and Prozyme reacted for 10 h at a 1.0% enzyme concentration relative to substrate.The molecular weight of HW PH was <5 kDa, and leucine was the prominent free amino acid.Both in vitro and in vivo tes ts showed that digestibility and intestinal permeability were higher in HWPH t han in WP.In BALB/c mice, as compared to WP, HWPH reduced allergic reactions by ind ucing elevated Type 1/Type 2 helper T cell ratio in the blood, splenocytes, and sma ll intestine.
Thus, HWPH may be utilized in a variety of low allergenicity products inte nded for infants, adults, and the elderly. Keywords hydrolysate, whey protein, response surface methodology, hypoal lergenic, infant nutrition Introduction Whey, a by-product resulting from the production of cheese, is a generic term for the remaining water-soluble components other than cheese (milk conc entrate curd).With ARTICLE Digestibility and Immunoregulator y Properties of Hypoallergenic Whey Protein Hydrolysate 595 the exception of casein, which i s involved in cheese production , whey is valued highly nutritionally and physiologically because of the presence of active ingredients including protein s, lactose, minerals, vitamins , and inorganic components (Boscaini et al., 2023; Yiğit et al., 2023).
Whey protein (WP) not only boosts immunity due to the presence of β-lactoglobulin (β-LG), α-lactalbumin (αLA), bovine serum albumin, lactoferrin (LF), immunoglobulin (Ig), enzymes, and glycomacropeptide, and is also a source of essential amino acids (Marshall, 2004). Though it is obvious that WP is a n excellent nutritive food, some of its components have been linked to allergic conditions in infants and young children (Ja iswal and Worku, 2022; Wright et al., 2022).Among the above mentioned proteins, the major an tigens include casein, β-LG, an d αLA, and it has been reported that most patients allergic to milk allergy have specific IgE antibodies against at least two antigens (Cohen et al., 2022; Savilahti and Kuitunen, 1992; Sicherer and Sampson, 1999).Among WPs, β-LG is known to be mor e allergenic than αLA.
In human milk, in particular, β- LG is present in smaller amounts ranging from 1–150 μg/mL (Exl and Fritsché, 2001), and its content is lower than that of casein, another allergen of milk, which comprises approximately 7% to 12% of milk protein. To lessen milk allergies, β-LG is hydrolyzed using digestive en zymes, and hypoallergenic milk powder prepared using proteolytic enzymes is commercially available (Lynch and Buckin , 2022).To reduce milk allergic reactions, it is necessary to provide a diet that restricts the causative milk or provided in a form that lowers the antigenicity of milk.Different treatme nt methods, such as heat, ultra-high pressure (Landim et al., 2023 ), and enzymes, can be used to reduce the antigenicity of proteins.Because one of the mai n allergens in milk, casein, is heat-resistant, the reduction in antigenicity by heat treatmen t is insignificant (Bu et al., 2013; Vandenplas et al., 2022).
Thus, milk proteins containing both structural and sequential epitop es are mainly hydrolyzed by enzymes. Although it doesn’t exist in human milk and has a lower content than αLA, the primary allergen of WP, β-LG, shows resis tance during digestion in the stomach and penetrates the intestines to cause milk allergies.Therefore, this study aimed to prepare WP hydrolysates (WPH) wi th reduced antigenicity of α-LA and β-LG allergens as target substrates.Optimal hydrolysis conditions for degrading antigenic WPs using a mixture of endo- and exo-type enzymes were selected using response sur face methodology (RSM).By prep aring a hypoallergenic whey protein hydrolysate (HWPH), we developed a milk protein manufacturing technology that can b e fed to milk-allergic infants.The digestibility and immune stimulation of the prepared hydrolysate were also evaluated.
Materials and Methods Materials In this study, whey protein concentrate (WPC; Agri-mark, Coral Gables, FL, USA) with a protein content of 80% (dry basis) was used as the raw WP. A 75% α-LA and a 95% β-LG from b ovine milk (Samyoung Innovation, Pyeongtaek, Korea) w e r e u s e d a s t h e a l l e r g e n s t a n d a rds.Alcalase (Novozymes, Copen hagen, Denmark), protamex (Novozymes), flavourzyme (Novozymes), and collupulin (DSM, Heerlen, Netherlands) were em ployed as endo-type proteolytic enzymes, whereas prozyme (DuPont, Wilmington, DE, USA) was used as an exo-type e nzyme.Pepsin and pancreatin (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA) were used as the artificial dige stive enzymes.L-leucine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.Preparation of whey protein hydrolysate To prepare the whey protein hydrolysate, a mixture of endo- and exo-type protease enzymes was added to a 10% suspension of WP at a concentra tion of 1.0% (v/w) relative to t he substrate solution.
This was then hydrolyzed for 8 h at 50℃ Food Science of Animal Resources V ol. 43, No.4, 2023 596 at pH 7.8 with shaking at 70×g.Each reaction solution was trea ted at 90℃ for 10 min to inactivate protease and then centrifuged at 5,500×g for 20 min to separate the supernatant.A WP solution without protease treatment was used as a control.The reaction conditions and enzyme characteristics use d for WP hydrolysis are listed in Supplementary Table S1.Identification of β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) and α-lactalbumin (α-L A) in whey protein hydrolysate using sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide g el electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) HWPH (10 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of sample buffer [0.5 M trih ydrochloric acid (HCl), glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8], heat-treated at 100°C for 5 min, cen trifuged, and the supernatant separated.A 20 μL of this was run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel at 135 V for approximately 90 m in.
To confirm the presence of α-LA and β-LG proteins, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 6 h , and then destained using a solution containing 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid until the protein bands were clear ly visible. Amino-nitrogen (A-N) contents and degree of hydrolysis (DH) cal culation The A-N content of HWPH was measured using the 2,4,6-trinitrobe nzensulfonic acid (TNBS) method (Nielsen et al., 2001).Briefly, 125 μL of the sample, 400 μL of 0.212 M phospha te buffer (pH 8.2), and 0.4 mL of 0.1% TNBS were mixed and incubated in the dark at 50°C for 60 min.Next, 0.8 mL of 1 00 mM HCl was added and left for 20 min.After another 10 min, 0.8 mL of distilled water was added, and the absorbance wa s measured at 340 nm.The amount of A-N was calculated using L-leucine as a standard.The DH of proteins following enzy me treatment was calculated us ing the following equation by estimated the A-N content of whey protein hydrolysates (Benjakul and Morrissey, 1997).
Th e total A-N content was measured by neutralizing WP with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) after hydrolysis at 100°C for 24 h usin g 6 N HCl. DH = (L t – L 0) / (L max – L 0) × 100 (1) Where L t is the A-N content after hydrolysis at time t, while L 0 is the A-N content before hydrolysis, and L max is the A-N content after acid hyd rolysis with 6 N HCl.Establishment of optimal mixing ratio of Alcalase and Prozyme a nd of optimal reaction conditions using response surface methodology (RSM) The RSM was used to select the optimal mixing ratio of Alcalase and Prozyme.A total of 15 combinations were composed of three repetitions of the experiment at 10% substrate, 50℃, pH 7 .8, with the mixing ratio of the two enzymes, Alcalase and Prozyme, as an independent variable (Supplementary Table S2).T he optimal mixing ratio of the two enzymes was selected by measuring the A-N of the hydrolysate corresponding to the exper i m e n t a l c o m b i n a t i o n .
R S M w a s u s e d t o a n a l y z e t h e experimental results, and the regression equation representing the optimal mixing ratio of Alcalase and Prozyme was as follows : aX + bY + cXY = 32.29 x + 68.87 y + 96.58 xy (2) where X is Alcalase (%) and Y is Prozyme (%). Digestibility and Immunoregulator y Properties of Hypoallergenic Whey Protein Hydrolysate 597 A total of 39 combinations were composed of three repetitions o f the experiment at 10% substrate, 50℃, pH 7.8, with the amount of enzyme added and hydrolysis time by the mixed enzyme of Alcalase and Prozyme as independent variables (Supplementary Table S3).The A-N of the hydrolysate correspond ing to the experimental combination was measured to select the optimal enzyme addition amount and hydrolysis time.
RSM was used to analyze the experimental results, and the regression equation representing the optimal conditions for the amount of enzyme added and hydrolysis time was as follows: A + aX + bY + cX2 + dY2 + eXY = 29.6286 – 0.9220 X + 4.5520 Y + 0.4706 X2 + 8.3643 Y2 – 2.0389 XY (3) where X is the hydrolysis time and Y is the amount of the enzym e added. Amino acid composition by high-performance liquid chromatograph y (HPLC) analysis Amino acids were derivatized using AccQ-Tag reagent (Waters, Mi lford, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then analyzed u sing an HPLC system (Waters).A n AccQ-Tag column (3.9 mm×150 mm, Waters) was used with the following parameters: temperature, 37℃; flow rate of t he mobile phase [Water AccQ-Tag Eluent A (acetate- phosphate buffer), acetonitrile, and Milli-Q Water], 1.0 mL/min , and a fluorescence detector (250 nm of excitation and 395 nm of emission) was used to analyze the data.
The analysis for total amino acids was performed after acid hyd rolysis. Briefly, 10 mL of 6 N HCl solution was added to 0.5 g of the samples taken in a test tube, which was sealed and hydrolyzed at 110℃ for 24 h.The filtrate obtained was centrifuged, and the supernatant concentrated at 50℃ to complet ely evaporate the acid and wate r, and then diluted to 5 mL using 20 mM HCl (pH 2.2).The dissolved solution was filtered t hrough a 0.45 µm membrane, and the filtrate was used as a sample for HPLC analysis.In vitro digestibility and intestinal permeability assay In vitro digestibility was determined as described by Garrett et al.(1 999) using pepsin and pancreatin.After dissolving 1,000 mg of the sample in distilled water, the pH was adjusted to 2.0.Pepsin (2.5% of the substrate) was added, reacted at 37℃ for 1 h, and the pH was then adjusted to 5.3 with sodium bi carbonate and further adjusted to 7.5 with 5 N NaOH.
Pancreatin was added at 4% per s ubstrate, reacted at 37℃ for 2 h, and was then heated at 90℃ for 10 min to inactivate the digestive enzyme. A-N (mg) was measured in the supernatant obta ined by centrifugation (14,000×g, 10 min), and digestibility (%) was calculated using the following formula: Digestibility (%) = [A-N in dige sted sample (mg) – A-N in sampl e before digestion (mg)] / [Total A-N in sample before dige stion (mg) – A-N in sample befo re digestion (mg)] × 100 (4) Total A-N in sample before diges tion: A-N content after acid hy drolysis.A Caco-2 Ready 24-well plate (Komabiotech, Seoul, Korea) was us ed for the permeability analysis of WP and HWPH (van Breemen and Li, 2005).The plate was incubated in a 5% CO 2 incubator (37℃) for 4 h, thawed, and then replaced with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Mediu m containing 1 g/L glucose, 10 % fetal bovine serum, and 1% glutamine.The assay was conducted 48 h after the medium w as replaced.
For the intestina l permeability analysis, WP and HWPH prepared using Food Science of Animal Resources V ol. 43, No.4, 2023 598 digestive enzymes (pepsin and pancreatin) were diluted 10-fold with HBSS buffer.After washing the Caco-2 plate with a complete monolayered film three times using HBSS buffer, 250 an d 750 μL of the diluted sample and HBSS buffer were dispensed into the insert and receiver plates, respectively.Th e buffer on the receiver plate was recovered over time (20, 40, 60, and 120 min).
After analyzing the protein content of the sa mple initially distributed in the insert and the sample collect ed over time using the bicinchoninic acid assay, the permeability of the sample was analyzed using the following formula (Park et al., 2021): Permeability (%) = [Total protei n (mg) in the receiver plate] / [Initial protein (mg) add ed to the insert] × 100 (5) Evaluation of absorption rate by high-dose single oral administ ration Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (6-week-old, male) were purchased from Oriental Bio (Seongnam, Korea). The animals were housed in a breeding room at 21±1℃, a relative humidity of 50%– 55%, and a light-dark cycle of 12 h.Drinking water and feed were provided ad libitum .After acclimation for a week, four SD-rats were randomly assi gned per experimental group.WP and HWPH were orally administered at 500 mg/kg, sacrificed a ccording to the sample administration times (20, 40, 60, and 120 min), and blood was collected.
Blood samples were colle cted from the control group at 0 min. Following centrifugation (2,000×g, 15 min, 4℃), serum was collected to me asure the total A-N content.All animal experiments were approved by the Korea University Animal Experiment Ethics Commi ttee (KUIACUC-2022-0095).Molecular weight distribution of hydrolysates To measure the molecular weight distribution of the hydrolysate using HPLC, the sample was filtered (microfilter, 0.45 μm) and 20 μL was injected into a Superdex G-75 column (10×300 mm, GE Healthcare, Anaheim, CA, USA).Subsequently, absorbance was measured at 220 nm , and the column was eluted wi th 50 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 5.5; 0.5 mL/min).
The molecular weight distribution of the hydrolysate w as measured according to the molecular weight distribution curve prepared using glutathione (MW 307), aprotinin (MW 6,512) , cytochrome c (MW 12,384), enolase (MW 67,000), lactate dehydrogenase (MW 142,000), and glutamate dehydrogenase (MW 290,000) as standard proteins, which were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Evaluation of immunological responses of hypoallergenic hydroly sates A specific pathogen free male BALB/c mice aged 8 weeks were pur chased from Daehan Biolink (Eumseong, Korea) and experimented under aseptic management (breeding room temperatur e, 25℃; humidity, 55%; and sterile distilled water supply).Mice were divided into groups administered 250 and 500 mg/kg of WP and HWPH, respectively, and a control group that was administered isotonic sodium chloride solution.Eight mice were included in each group.Gastric intubation was performed five times per week for 4 weeks.
Body weight was measured twice a week at 3-day intervals. After administration, blood was collected and centrifuged at 2,000×g for 10 min to separate the serum.After sacrifice, aseptically excised splenocytes for cell cultu re were dispensed into 24 well-culture plates and cultured in a CO 2 incubator for 48 h.Subsequently, phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Al d r i c h , 5 μ g / L × 1 06 cells) was added as a polyclonal stimulator for in vitro activation.The concentration of cytokines (INF-γ and IL4), an tibodies (IgG2a and IgG1) and IgE in the cell culture medium were measured using an ELISA kit purchased from BD Bioscience (San Diego, CA, USA).For the small Digestibility and Immunoregulator y Properties of Hypoallergenic Whey Protein Hydrolysate 599 intestine cytokines, 2 mL of PBS was added to 0.5 g of duodenum aseptically extracted after sacrifice, vortexed, and left at 4℃ for 2 days.
Thereafter, the supernatant obtained by centrifu gation was analyzed for cytokines and IgE using the ELISA kits. Statistical analysis Data were statistically analyzed using SPSS (ver.12.0; SPSS, C hicago, IL, USA), and the m ean and SD were calculated for all measured values.The sig nificance between the experimen tal groups was tested by ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple range test at p<0.05 level.RSM analysis was performed using Minitab 17 software (Minitab, State College, PA, USA) to confirm the suitability o f the model to understand the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.Results and Discussion Selection of enzyme combinations for the preparation of hypoall ergenic whey protein hydrolysate (HWPH) WP accounts for approximately 20% of the total milk protein.β- LG and α-LA are the major allergens, and serum albumin, Ig, and LF also act as allergens (Hochwallner et al., 2014).
α- LA and β-LG are more effective in reducing allergic reactions using proteolytic enzymes due to their acid-resistant and heat- resistant structures (Stănciuc a nd Rapeanu, 2010; Yuan et al., 2018). Proteolytic enzymes under mild conditions convert protei ns to shorter chain peptides and amino acids, yielding minimal byproducts.It is documented that enzymatic protein hyd rolysis can alter the protein structure without compromising its nutritional value, thereby r educing the functional properti es or allergens (Cui et al., 2023; Kheroufi et al., 2022).To select enzymes that could degrade α-LA and β-LG, endo-type e nzymes (Alcalase, Collupulin , and Protamex) and exo- type enzymes (Prozyme) were mixed, and hydrolysis was performed for 8 h.A combination of enzymes in which α-LA and β-LG were degraded was selected by SDS-PAGE.
Following electrop horesis, the α-LA and β-LG bands were not seen in the hydrolysate prepared using the m ixture of Alcalase and Prozyme, revealing that the two allergens were decomposed (Supplementary Fig. S1).Fig.1 shows the A-N and DH in the hyd rolysate obtained after treatment with the enzyme mixture.The levels of A-N and DH in the HWPHs obtained from by mixing A lcalase and Prozyme were significantly higher than those in the other hydrolysates.Thus, this mixture was the mos t suitable enzyme combination for the hydrolysis of α-LA and Fig.1.Amino-nitrogen (A-N) (A) and degree of hydrolysis (DH) (B) of w h e y p r o t e i n h y d r o l y s a t e b y m i x i n g e n d o - a n d e x o - t y p e s protease.V a l u e s a r e m e a n ± S D f o r e a c h g r o u p ( n = 3 ) .a–d D i f f e r e n t l e t t e r s r e p r e s e n t s i g nificant difference at p<0.05 b ased on Tukey’s multiple range test.Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.43, No.4, 2023 600 β-LG.
Proteolytic enzymes have different properties depending on the order of hydrolysis and the combination of endo-type enzymes that hydrolyze proteins r oughly and exo-type enzymes th at degrade proteins from the end (Villanueva et al., 1999). Alcalase, a serine protease (endo-type), cleaves the internal c hains of proteins and peptides as well as peptide bonds following Glu, Met, Leu, Tyr, Lys, and Gln (Adamson and Reynold s, 1996).Prozymes are fungal exo-proteases from Aspergillus oryzae suitable for producing HWPH (Suh et al., 2017).Among the hydr olysates prepared using exo- and endo- type enzymes, α-LA and β-LG were not detected in the hydrolysat es prepared using Alcalase and Prozyme, and their A-N content and DH were the highest (Fig.1 and Supplementary Fig.S1).
Mixing ratio of Alcalase and Prozyme for the preparation of hyp oallergenic whey protein hydrolysate (HWPH) According to the 15 combinations recommended by the RSM, hydrol ysates were prepared to choose the appropriate mixing ratio of Alcalase and Prozyme for the production of HWPH (Suppl ementary Table S2). DH was calculated by measuring the A- N content of the hydrolysate (Fig.2).The A-N content and DH o f the hydrolysate obtained by mixing Alcalase and Prozyme at 1:1 and 1:3, respectively, were significantly higher than those of the hydrolysate obtained at other mixing ratios (p<0.05).T he regression equation for the A-N content obtained from the multi ple regression analysis is as follows: Fig.2.A-N content (A, C) and DH (B, D) of whey protein hydrolysate o ptimized using response su rface methodology (RSM).(A, B) RSM conditions according to the mixin g ratio of Alcalase and Prozym e.
Whey protein hydrolysis was p erformed using a mixture of Alc alase and Prozyme in 10% substrate for 8 at 50 ℃ and pH 7.8. (C, D) RSM condition s according to the addition am ount and reaction time of the mixed enzymes.Values are mean±SD for each group (n=3).a–d Other letters are significantly different at p<0.05 by Tukey’s multiple range test.A-N, amino-nitrogen; D H, degree of hydrolysis.Digestibility and Immunoregulator y Properties of Hypoallergenic Whey Protein Hydrolysate 601 A-N (mg/mL) = 32.29 x + 68.87 y + 96.58 xy (6) x: Alcalase (%), y: Prozyme (%), r2 = 97.54%.As a result of predicting the optimal ratio of an enzyme mixtur e using RSM, when Alcalase and Prozyme were mixed 1:1, the A-N content was expected to be the highest at 50.42 mg/mL.The A-N content of the hydrolysate produced by Alcalase and Prozyme mixed in a 1:1 ratio, as predicted by RSM, was 51.5 2 mg/mL, and the actual measured value (50.42 mg/mL) was close to this predicted value.
Thus, for the preparation of HWPH, the combination of Alcalase and Prozyme at 0.5/0.5 or 0.25/0.75 was most appropriate (Fig. 2).Hydrolysis conditions such as temperature, pH, and enzyme–subst rate ratio also affect protein hydrolysis (Diniz and Martin, 1997; Vieira et al., 1995) .When enzymes are to be mixe d, the mixing ratio plays an important role in determining the hydrolysate’s properties.The hydrolysate produced by the mixtu re of Alcalase and Prozyme at a ratio of 1:1 showed the highest A-N and DH (Fig.2).Optimization of enzyme amount and hydrolysis time for the prepa r a t i o n o f h y p o a l l e r g e n i c w h e y p r o t e i n hydrolysate (HWPH) by Alcalase-Prozyme mixture To select the optimal enzyme concentration and the hydrolysis t ime for HWPH production by the Alcalase-Prozyme mixture, the A-N content of the hydrolysate was measured accord ing to the 39 combinations suggested by the RSM (Supplementary Table S3).
The regression equation for the A-N c ontent obtained from the multiple regression analysis is as follows: A-N (mg/mL) = 0.471 X2 + 8.364 Y2 – 2.039 XY – 0.922 X + 4.552 Y + 29.62 (7) X: hydrolysis time (h), Y: e nzyme addition amount (%), r 2 = 96.80%. With an increase in the amount of enzyme and the hydrolysis tim e, the A-N content also increased (Fig.2).The highest amount of A-N was observed when hydrolysis was performed for 10 h with the addition of 1.0% enzyme compared to the substrate.The expected amount of A-N at the optimal enzyme con centration and hydrolysis time predicted by RSM was 60.00 mg/mL, and the actual measured value of 59.58 mg/mL was c lose to this, with the r2 value being 0.968.To produce a HWPH by the Alcalase-Prozyme mixt ure, hydrolysis with 1.5% enzy me addition was found to be most suitable compared to the substrate for 8 h.
Under the optimal reaction conditions of the WPH to produce low allergens, when WP and allerg en-inducing substances α- L A a n d β - L G w e r e h y d r o l y z e d a s substrates, the decomposition of these substances was confirmed through gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3).The bands for these allergens appeare d dark before hydrolysis (0 h), and faded after 4 h of hydrolys is.After an 8 h hydrolysis, almost no bands were visible, confirmi ng that α-LA and β-LG were decomposed by the mixed enzyme treatment.Amino acids composition of hypoallergenic whey protein hydrolys ate (HWPH) The amino acid composition of HWPH treated with Alcalase and Pr ozyme enzymes (Table 1) revealed the composition of Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.43, No.4, 2023 602 Fig.3.Bands of α-lactalbumin (α-LA) and β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) as se en in gel electrophoresis accord ing to hydrolysis time of whey protein (WP).Table 1.

In all, 17 types of free amino acids were detected, with leucine being the most prominen t (16.8%, 351.73±4.62 μmole/g), followed by valine (13.8%), lysine (11.2%), and isoleucine (8.7%).As high levels of these amino acids cause bitterness, the bitterness in the sample was consistent with their presence.Digestibility and intestinal permeability by Caco-2 cell Changes in A-N content and digestibility were measured when WP and HWPH were treated with t he artificial digestive enzymes pepsin and pancreatin (Figs.4A and B).As the digestio n of pepsin and pancreatin progressed, the A-N content and digestibility tended to increase.WP and HWPH were more hydroly zed by pancreatin treatment, and the increase in A-N content and digestibility was significantly higher than that by pepsin treatment.
The amount of A-N at each stage of the digestive enzyme treatment was significantly higher in HWPH tha n in WP (Fig. 4A).As for the change in digestibility, HWPH, which had a high A-N content before hydrolysis, showed lo wer digestibility than WP in the pepsin treatment stage but a higher level of digestib ility increase than WP in the pan creatin treatment stage was noted (Fig.4B).By measuring the intestinal perm eability of Caco-2 cells (Figs.4C, D, E, and F), it was confirmed that the permeability of HWPH was significantly higher than that of the WP sample at the indicated treatment time points of 20, 40, 60, and 120 min.The intestinal permeability of Ca co-2 cells at each stage of tr eatment with pepsin and pancreatin was also significantly highe r in HWPH than in WP.Thus, it was confirmed that the digestibili ty and intestinal permeability of HWPH determined by Alcalase and Prozyme were h igher than those of WP.
The size of the peptides constituting the protein also affects the digestibility and absorption. Peptides of ≤500 Da have higher bioavailability than peptides of ≥2,000 Da (Feng and Bet ti, 2017; Wang and Li, 2017).Hydrolysates composed of small peptides are absorbed into the bloodstream through the in testinal wall and confer their effects (Chatterjee et al., 2018 ).WP and HWPH are converted into smaller peptides by pepsin and p ancreatin and absorbed through the intestinal mucosa.During in vitro digestion, pancreatin t reatment resulted in higher A-N content and digestibility than pepsin treatment (Fig.4).Evaluation of absorption rate of whey protein (WP) and hypoalle rgenic whey protein hydrolysate (HWPH) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats Changes in the amount of A-N in the blood were measured after t he oral administration of WP and HWPH to SD rats (Fig.5).Twenty min after oral administration, the highest amount of A-N was observed in the blood, which decreased gradually thereafter.
After 20 and 40 min , as compared to WR, the adminis tration of HWPH resulted in a s ignificantly higher amount of A-N in the blood (p<0.001). HWPH , a HWPH produced by Alcalase-P rozyme, is composed of smaller peptides than WP and is easily digested and absorbed; t h e r e f o r e , t h e a m o u n t o f A - N i n the blood may have been high at the beginning of oral administration.Pancreatin contains endopeptidases (trypsin and chymotrypsin) a nd exopeptidases (carboxypeptid ase; Andriamihaja et al., 2013), which can hydrolyze WPs into smaller peptides than pepsi n.Since β-LG is resistant to digestive enzymes (Villas-Boas et al., 2015), HWPH, in which β- LG is decomposed by Alcalase/Pr ozyme treatment, showed higher digestibility than WP.The measurement of the absorptio n rate through Caco-2 cells and animal experiments (Figs.4 and 5) showed that the hydrolysate (HWPH) had better permeability than before hydrolys is (WP).
Animal experiments showed a difference in the absorption rate within 40 min of oral administration. Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.43, No.4, 2023 604 Molecular weight distribution of hypoallergenic whey protein hy drolysate (HWPH) The molecular weight distributio ns of the WP and HWPH were dete rmined using a Superdex G-75 column (Fig.6).WP was noted to contain several peptides with molecular weights of 18 and 5.8 kDa.In contrast, HWPH produced by Alcalase Fig.4.Changes in (A) A-N content, (B) digestibility, and (C, D, E, F ) intestinal permeability according to time in Caco-2 cells exp osed to WP and hypoallergenic whey protein hydrolysate (HWPH) treated w ith in vitro digestive enzymes.Values are mean±SD for each group (n=3).a–c Different letters represent signi ficant differences at p<0.05 b ased on Tukey’s multiple range test.*** p<0.001 for HWPH as compared to WP.WP, whey protein ; ns, not significant; A-N, ami no-nitrogen.
Digestibility and Immunoregulator y Properties of Hypoallergenic Whey Protein Hydrolysate 605 and Prozyme mainly consists of peptides of 5 kDa or less, and t he main peaks were approximately 384 Da and 214 Da, respectively. WP was degraded into small peptides of 2.6, 1.3, and 0.491 kDa when treated with pepsin, and following pancreatin treatment, it was hydrolyzed into peptides with smal ler molecular weights than when treated with pepsin (Figs.6B and C).The molecular weight distribution of HWPH was similar a fter pepsin and pancreatin treatments.Since the HWPH had already been hydrolyzed by the enzyme (Figs.6E and F), the effect of pepsin and pancreatin treatments on the molecular Fig.5.A-N changes in serum of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats following ora l administration of WP and HWPH before and after hydrolysis o f WP with mixed enzymes.Values are mean±SD for each group (n=4).a–d Different letters represent significant difference at p<0.05 b ased on Tukey’s multiple range test.

En zymatic hydrolysis of milk proteins can prevent allergic sensitization by minimizing the number of sensitizing protein e pitopes through the decomposition of allergenic sites or reduction in protein size (<1,500 Da; Crittenden and Bennett, 2 005; Fiocchi et al., 2003). WP is mainly composed of 1,800 and 5,800 Da peptides, but Alcalas e/Prozyme hydrolysate (HWPH) was composed of short peptides of 384 and 214 Da (Fig.6).Therefore, the peptides constituting HWPH are small in size , which increases the absorption and bioavailability, but will be limited in antibody production due to their size.Effect of hypoallergenic whey protein hydrolysate (HWPH) admini stration on cellular immunity of mice The content and ratio of cytokines (INF-γ and IL-4) and antibod ies (IgG2a and IgG1) corresponding to Type 1 helper T (Th1) and Type 2 helper T (Th2) effector cells in the blood, sp leen cells, and small intestine are closely related to the immu ne response caused by allergens.
INF-γ and IL-4 in the blood of mi ce administered with WP and HWPH tended to marginally increase as compared to mice in the control group, but this dif ference was not significant (Table 2). Although not statistical ly significant, the ratio of Th1/Th2 (INF-γ/IL-4) also showed an i ncrease with HWPH treatment.The ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 between WP and HWPH was signifi cantly increased by the oral adm inistration of 250 a nd 500 mg/kg HWPH.Table 2.Changes in cytokines and antibodies in the blood, spleen cells and small intestine after oral administration of WP and HWPH Sample (mg/kg) Serum INF-γ (pg/mL) IL-4 (pg/mL) INF-γ/IL-4 IgG2a (ng/mL) IgG1 (ng/mL) IgG2a/IgG1 CON 8.87±1.50ns 5.30±0.21ns 1.65±0.24ns 52.62±2.18 26.32±0.65 2.01±0.13 WP 250 8.82±2.07 7.73±0.72 1.12±0.32 136.70±1.76*** 69.29±1.57 1.97±0.02 500 9.95±1.71 10.53±2.90 1.16±0.35 103.27±2.98** 500.69±36.01*** 0.21±0.01*** HWPH 250 10.70±1.89 7.64±1.

Digestibility and Immunoregulator y Properties of Hypoallergenic Whey Protein Hydrolysate 607 CD4+ helper T (Th) cells play a central role in the immune response and secrete various cytokines that affect the function of B cells and the immune system. Depending on the secreted cyt okines, they are divided into Th1 and Th2 effector cells (Herzyk et al., 2001; Lavigne et al., 1998) which exhibit chara cteristic cytokine profiles (MacLeod et al., 2008).Cytokines (IFN-γ) and antibodies (IgG2a) s ecreted from Th1 cells have an antagonistic action with cytokines (IL-4) and antibodies (IgG1) secreted from Th2 cells.The ratio of INF-γ/IL-4 in the splenocytes decreased significan tly in the group administered with 500 mg/kg of WP compared to that in the control group (p<0.01).The ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 (Th1:Th2) was similar or higher in the HWPH-administered groups than in the control group, whereas the WP orally adminis tered group showed a lower ratio, but the difference was not significant.
There was a significant difference in the IgG2a/Ig G1 ratios between the HWPH and WP groups. Cytokines and antibodies specific to Th1 and Th2 cells in the s mall intestine of mice orally administered WP and HWPH were analyzed (Table 2).The IL-4 content in the groups orally administered with WP and HWPH was significantly higher than that in the control group (p<0.05).The ratio of INF-γ/IL- 4, corresponding to the Th1/Th2 ratio, tended to increase as th e dose of HWPH increased, and the 500 mg/kg oral administration g roup showed a significantly higher level than the control group (p<0.05).IgG2a levels in the small intestine in the two groups were significantly higher than in the control group.The ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 and the ratio of Th1 to Th2 cells were sign ificantly higher in the HWPH-administered group than in the control group (p<0.001).There was a significant difference in the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio between the WP and HWPH groups in terms of the dose (p<0.001).
Abnormalities in the maintenance o f T h 1 a n d T h 2 c e l l h o m e o s t a s i s are known to lead to various immunopathological abnormalities. When Th2 is relatively dominant, it promotes dec reased defense against microbial infections, such as bacteria and viruses, allergic developmen t, and some autoimmune diseases (Prigent et al., 1995; Umetsu and DeKruyff, 1997), and excessive immune responses (cell- mediated immunity) of Th1 cell s are associated with auto-immune diseases (Gans et al., 2003; Margalit et al., 2005).As depicted in Table 2, the ratio of IFN-γ/IL-4 was higher for HWPH than for WP, indicating that the allergic reaction induced by Th2 was somewhat suppress ed.This is due to the fact that IgG2a isotype switching is induced by IFN-γ, and isotype switching of IgG1 or IgE is induc ed by IL-4, which inhibits the function or production of IFN- γ (Kühn et al., 1991; Snapper and Paul, 1987).
The IgG2a/IgG1 r atio was higher in the HWPH than in the WP, suggesting that the Th1 response was relatively stimulated rather than the Th2 response, and thus, antibody conversion was induced, leading to a significant suppression of the allergic reaction ( Table 2). Oral administration of HWPH increased the levels of Th1 cytokin es and antibodies in the blood, spleen, and small intestine, whereas the levels of Th2 cytokines and antibodies w ere lower than those in the WP group.In addition, the IgE content in the blood, splenocytes, and small intestine was sign ificantly different between the t wo groups (Fig.7).HWPH, in which a α-LA and β-LG had been decomposed, had a lower level of allergen-related intracellular immune response than WP, and thus presumed to have a lower allergenic potential due to t he hydrolysis of the allergen-inducing substances.The allergic response to WP is representativ e of type I immune hypersensitiv ity involving IgE (Martorell-Aragonés et al., 2015).
Oral administration of HWPH resulted in a significantly lower IgE pr oduction than that of WP (Fig. 7).HWPH, a hydrolysate produced by Alcalase and Prozym e, seems to reduce allergic reac tions as it hydrolyzes LG and LA, the two allergens in WP.Conclusion The mixing ratio of Alcalase and Prozyme, and the enzyme treatm ent conditions for HWPH production were optimized Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.43, No.4, 2023 608 using RSM.The mixed treatment o f Alcalase and Prozyme effectiv ely degraded α-LA and β-LG, the major allergens of WP.Because HWPH is converted into s mall peptides by enzyme treatme nt and has a low molecular weight, its digestibility and intestinal permeability are higher than those of WP.In additio n, it was confirmed that HWPH suppressed the allergic immune response by stimulating the Th1 response, but not the Th2 respo nse, and by inducing antibody conversion.
Thus, HWPH can be expected to be useful in a variety of products with low alle rgenicity targeting infants, adults, and the elderly.
