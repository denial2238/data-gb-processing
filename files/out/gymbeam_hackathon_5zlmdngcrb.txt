Observational Study 1 Medicine®Exploration in association between vitamin D, sleep quality, and osteoarthritis A modeling study Xuan Zhou, MDa, Yaqi Gong, MDa,* Abstract Previous studies on the relationship between vitamin D, sleep quality, and osteoarthritis (OA) have been controversial and the aim of this study is to analyze the association.In this study, relevant data from 2 survey cycles (2009–2010 with 2011–2012) are downloaded from the CDC’s NHANES project to analyze the relationship between vitamin D, sleep quality, and osteoarthritis, as well as other related risk factors.The analysis of statistics in this study is performed using t-tests and chi-square tests, modeling is performed using logistic regression based on NHANES weights, and other risk factors are analyzed using forest plots.In association models between serum vitamin D, sleep quality, and OA is statistically significant during the stepwise inclusion of covariates.
In model 1, Q3 (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.23) and Q4 (OR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.27, 3.94) are significant. Neither model 2 nor model 3 is statistically significant and P for trend is more than .05 in all 3 models.After the inclusion of all covariates, forest plot showed that sleep deprivation (OR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.56), advanced age (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04), female (OR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.85), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30) (OR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.61), and obesity (≥30) (OR = 2.06; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.93) are risk factors for OA.This study is based on a larger sample and a stepwise logistic regression of multiple covariates.We concluded that vitamin D may not influence OA.However other risk factors for OA are confirmed, including advanced age, female and high BMI, especially bad sleep quality.

In peo- ple with OA, vitamin D administration may lessen discomfort and enhance knee function.[5] Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. It helps in the absorption of calcium from the intestine and its incorporation into bone, which is essential for maintaining bone density and strength.Vitamin D also regulates the function of chondro- cytes, the cells responsible for producing and maintaining car - tilage.
It has been suggested that vitamin D insufficiency may result in the impaired production or function of chondrocytes, leading to cartilage breakdown and the progression of OA.[6] Epidemiological studies, however, do not show evidence of an independent association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels and hip or hand OA, according to a meta-analysis.[7] Except in situations with advanced knee OA, there is little evi- dence to support recommendations for vitamin D supplemen- tation to stop the onset or progression of OA.[8] According to a Mendelian randomization study, genetic variations linked to low serum vitamin D levels did not increase the incidence of hip or knee OA in older people. Supplementing with vitamin D is unlikely to stop hip or knee OA.[9] Sleep is the most significant activities in a person’s life and essential to both health and metabolism.
Several studies have revealed that sleep disruption, decreasing nociceptive hyper - sensitivity or endogenous pain control, plays a critical role in the manifestation of OA pain.[10,11] Studies indicate that rest- ful sleep may lessen the effects of OA-related fatigue.[12] Sleep disruption in individuals with OA can lead to nociceptive hypersensitivity, increased inflammation, central sensitization, The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.

Managing sleep disturbances and promoting healthy sleep hygiene can help alleviate pain and improve the overall well-being of indi- viduals with OA.[13] Based on previous conflicting findings, we further analyzed the relationship between vitamin D, sleep quality, and OA using a large NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) sample size and multiple covariates. 2.Methods 2.1.Samples The sample for this study is drawn from data from the NHANES survey,[14–18] a large survey covering demographic, dietary, phys- ical examination data, laboratory data, and questionnaire data.Two eligible survey cycles, 2009 to 2010 and 2011 to 2012, are selected according to the main components of the study, OA and vitamin D.These 2 survey cycles contained a sample of 20,206 individuals and after screening for missing values, the final eligi- ble sample size is 476.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: age more than 18 years old; participants with osteoarthritis; participants received related questionnaire, examination, and laboratory test. The exclusion criteria were as follows: lack of continuous records samples; other main outcome or exposure; lack of a lot of covariates.2.2.Ethics approval All participants in this study are provided with informed con- sent by the NHANES project and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/ irba98.htm#print).2.3.osteoarthritis and included covariates The OA data for this study are obtained from the NHANES medical condition questionnaire, for the arthritis question, with responses diagnosed as OA or non-OA.
The vitamin D data are obtained from laboratory data and the experimental method is the quantitative determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3), epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (epi-25-OHD3), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25OHD2) in human serum using ultra- high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spec- trometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), and we selected total 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 (25OHD3) as an indicator of serum vitamin D. Sleep disorder questionnaire containing a limited number of questions on sleep habits and disorders is used to collect self- reported average sleep time per night from NHANES.Sleep duration < 7 h/night is defined as sleep deprivation in this study in accordance with the National Sleep Foundation’s recommen- dation of a normal sleep duration of 7 to 9 h/d for adults.In addition, the demographic data for this study are taken from the demographic part of the survey, and the disease history data and lifestyle data are taken from the questionnaire part.2.4.
Statistical analysis We first performed a descriptive analysis of all covariates, grouped by the presence or absence of OA, and performed a t-test on the quantitative data and a chi-square test on the cat- egorical data. To analyze the relationship between OA and vitamin D, we sliced the vitamin D data into 4 quarters, which are used to see if there is a dose-response relationship.We then used logistic regression to build 3 separate models with progressive inclu- sion of covariates, thus verifying the stability of the relationship.After all variables are included in the models, forest plots of the relationship between all OA and covariates are produced so that other risk factors that may be associated with OA could be analyzed.All analyzes in this study are performed by R4..2.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) and P < .05 is considered statisti- cally significant.3.
Results Table 1 shows all the covariates for the 2 groups, OA and non-OA, and it can be seen that some indicators are higher in the OA group than in the non-OA group, including vitamin D, sleep quality, age, percentage of females, and percentage of whites. For other covariates, the differences between the 2 groups are not statistically significant.This difference provides a basis for exploring the relationship between vitamin D, sleep quality, and OA.Table 2 shows that in all 3 models there is no dose-response relationship (P for trend > .05), Q3 (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.23) and Q4 (OR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.27, 3.94) is statistically significant in model 1, OR is not statistically significant in any of model 2, and OR is not statistically significant in any of model 3 after inclusion of all covariates.This suggests that vitamin D may not be a risk or protective factor for OA.On the basis of model 3, all variables are pooled and forest plots are drawn.
It can be seen that vitamin D is not statistically significant at Q2, Q3, and Q4 levels, suggesting that vitamin D may not be associated with OA. However, sleep quality had association with OA that sleep deprivation (OR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.56) contributed to OA.In addition, age (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04), female (OR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.85), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30) (OR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.61), and obesity (≥30) (OR = 2.06; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.93) are risk fac- tors for OA (Fig.1).4.Discussion The results of the current study suggest that serum vitamin D levels may not reduce the risk of OA, unlike the previous extensive reports that oral vitamin D supplementation may be prepaid for the treatment of OA.This may be due to the fact that serum vitamin D levels are not equated with the dose of oral vitamin D.
Patients who have taken oral vitamin D sup- plements may be influenced by other factors that weaken or enhance the absorption of vitamin D, resulting in inconsis- tencies between serum vitamin D and vitamin D supplement doses. Our findings, of course, are consistent with some other previous reports.According to a McAlindon et al trial[19] that is published in JAMA in 2013, vitamin D supplementation at doses that increased plasma levels of 250 HD to > 36 ng/ml did not, compared to a placebo, lessen knee discomfort or cartilage volume loss after 2 years.According to a 2016 study by Jin et al published in JAMA,[20] vitamin D supplementation did not significantly differ from a placebo in terms of changes in tibial cartilage volume assessed by MRI or WOMAC knee pain scores over a 2-year period in patients with knee OA and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.
This study did not support the use of vitamin D supplementation to stop cartilage loss or reduce WOMAC knee pain in patients with knee OA. The impact of vitamin D on OA has not been determined by in vitro research.1,25(OH)2D enhanced the expression of Mmp13 RNA and protein in ATDC5 and rat chondrosarcoma chondrocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner.[21,22] Contrarily, 1,25(OH)2D suppressed the expression of type II collagen and aggregated proteoglycan, suggesting that vitamin D may cause or aggravate OA,[23] which is consistent with our findings.In this research, sleep deprivation is a risk factor for OA.Uncertain mechanisms underlie the connection between OA pain and sleep/fatigue.
Although OA pain can alter 3Zhou and Gong • Medicine (2024) 103:40 www.md-journal.com sleep and insufficient sleep can worsen OA pain percep- tion, the relationship is complicated and may be bidirec- tional.[24] According to a study by the OATS, improved sleep hygiene can effectively treat insomnia in persons who have pain by reducing their OA discomfort over the long run, enhancing depression and weariness, and increasing sleep in the process.[10] It was reported that obstructive sleep apnea influences OA pro- gression through a shared inflammatory pathway, particularly involving the TNF signaling cascade. This connection underscores Table 1 Characteristics of included samples.

4Zhou and Gong • Medicine (2024) 103:40 Medicine the importance of addressing sleep disturbances in patients with OA and highlights potential therapeutic targets for managing both con- ditions.[25] Further research may clarify the roles of specific miRNAs and the efficacy of proposed drug interventions in clinical settings. While cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia shows promise in improving sleep disturbances in individuals with knee OA and insomnia, it does not appear to significantly reduce IL-6 levels or systemic inflammation.Sleep impairment is a significant concern in rheumatoid arthritis, influenced by complex interactions between inflammation, pain, comorbidities, and medications.[26] The conse- quences extend beyond sleep quality, affecting overall health and quality of life.
A thorough understanding of these relationships is essential for developing effective management strategies to improve sleep and, consequently, the well-being of RA patients.[27] Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms involved and optimize treatment approaches. On this basis, we again validated that advanced age, female, and high BMI are all risk factors for OA, which is consistent with previous reports.Age has a beneficial impact on the risk of OA of the hip and knee in women, according to research on the relation- ship between age, gender, and OA affecting other joints.[28] Women often have smaller femoral head diameters, greater anterior femoral neck inclination, and greater acetabular anteversion and tilt when it comes to gender differences in hip anatomy.[29] There is evidence to show that worse hip alignment and the subsequent development of OA are caused by increased acetabular anteversion along the femur.
In addition, postmenopausal women’s reduced estrogen levels could age-related illness progression.A second investigation into the relationship between obesity and OA revealed that class II obesity (a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or higher) is related with a higher risk of OA in the knee, hip, and hand in individuals.[30] As comparison to those who are of nor - mal weight, class II obese people had a 4.7-fold higher risk of developing knee OA. Leptin may be connected to this phenom- enon (LEP).It has been proposed that high BMI is highly cor - related with greater LEP promoter methylation levels in patients with OA, and that this link is especially strong in obese patients with OA.[31] This study has the advantage of including a large sample size and a number of covariates for analysis.However, there are still some limitations of this study.Firstly, the study fails to fully explain the reasons for the failure of vitamin D to affect OA from a mechanistic perspective.
Secondly, the survey data used in this study are derived from cross-sectional studies and cannot be used as a basis for causality inference. Finally, the covariates not included in this study may also affect OA.In conclusion, based on a larger sample and multiple covari- ates, the analysis in this study concluded that vitamin D may not influence the occurrence of OA, but other risk factors for OA are confirmed, including sleep deprivation, advanced age, female and high BMI.Author contributions Data curation: Yaqi Gong.Formal analysis: Xuan Zhou, Yaqi Gong.Figure 1.Forest plot for risk factors of osteoarthritis.
