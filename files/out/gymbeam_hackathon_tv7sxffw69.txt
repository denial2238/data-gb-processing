The positive effects of lactobacilli and biﬁdobacteria on the function of many body systems have been repeatedly proven by various studies. To completely realize the potential of probiotic microorganisms, the strains should be tested by the greatest combination of characteristics that contribute to the wellness of the host.In this work, for the ﬁrst time, a combined assessment of the probiotic properties and vitamin B-producing potential of various species and strains of biﬁdobacteria and lactobacilli was carried out.The presence of an additional advantage, such as vitamin-producing ability, can prevent vitamin deﬁciency both at the level of the consumption of fermented foods, when the enrichment will occur naturally on the spot, and during colonization by these intestinal strains, when synthesis will occur in vivo .
To select potential probiotics, the stress tolerance ability of 16 lactic acid bacteria and biﬁdobacteria strains to low pH values, bile, and proteolytic enzymes, as well as their ability to autoaggregate, were studied under conditions of modeling the gastrointestinal tract in vitro . The ability of the strains to extracellularly accumulate water-soluble B vitamins was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis.Among the tested strains of biﬁdobacteria, B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662 is of interest; it was characterized by the greatest stress tolerance ability and the ability to autoaggregate, in addition to the extracellular synthesis of riboﬂavin and pyridoxine.Among lactic acid bacteria, L.sakei VKPM B-8936 demonstrated the greatest tolerance to low pH, L.plantarum VKPM B–11007 to duodenal conditions, L.acidophilus VKPM B-2213 to pepsin, and L.salivarius VKPM B–2214 to pancreatin.The highest percentage of autoaggregation was observed in L.
salivarius VKPM B-2214, which also accumulated the largest amount of pantothenic acid, but it was sensitive to stress conditions. The obtained results could be used to create new products enriched with probiotics and B vitamins.Keywords: probiotics; Biﬁdobacterium ;Lactobacillus ; probiotic properties; water-soluble B vitamins; biofortiﬁcation; stress tolerance ability; aggregation ability 1.Introduction Fortiﬁcation of food products with chemically synthesized vitamins is a traditional way of increasing their biological value in order to prevent vitamin deﬁciency, which can have negative effects on the development and functioning of the body.A lack of B vitamins in humans can lead to various diseases.Folic acid deﬁciency can lead to osteoporosis, coronary heart disease, decreased cognitive function and Alzheimer’s disease, hearing loss [ 1], and an increased risk of breast cancer [ 2].
Riboﬂavin deﬁciency can lead to skin and liver damages, as well as changes in glucose metabolism in the brain [ 3]. Thiamine deﬁciency causes beriberi disease, which can have consequences for both the cardiovascular and the nervous system.Niacin deﬁciency can lead to pellagra, lack of pantothenic acid to acne, pyridoxine deﬁciency to dermatitis and epileptic seizures, and a Microorganisms 2022 ,10, 470.https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10020470 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms Microorganisms 2022 ,10, 470 2 of 16 lack of biotin can cause growth retardation in children [ 4].Recently, the efﬁcacy of synthetic vitamins has been in doubt and so they need to be analyzed.It is reported that their bioavailability is worse than that of natural forms of vitamins, which means they might not be as effective [ 5].Also, some studies show that chemically synthesized vitamins can even have a negative effect on human health.
For example, high consumption of foods enriched with chemically synthesized folic acid, not the natural form, in some people can lead to masking vitamin B12 deﬁciency, leukemia, arthritis, and an increased risk of cancer [ 6]. At the same time, synthetic vitamins are quite expensive due to the large number of stages of production.Finally, consumer requirements for food quality are increasing and preference is given to a healthy diet, so much attention is paid to the absence of synthetic additives in the composition.Biofortiﬁcation by fermentation of lactic acid bacteria and biﬁdobacteria with vitamin- producing ability is a promising approach for obtaining foods with increased concentrations of natural forms of B vitamins.Most members of the Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium are normal representatives of the human intestinal microbiota and are generally recognized as safe (GRAS), which makes them the most suitable candidates for these purposes.
Some authors insist that careful selection of starter cultures with increased vitamin B-synthesizing ability can enhance the concentration of folic acid in yogurts over 200 µg L−1[7–9] or beverages, and thereby lead to the development of innovative functional products [ 10]. Such foods will not only be healthy, but also economically beneﬁcial.The strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) selected according to the speciﬁed criteria have already been used as starters for bread and pasta production enriched with riboﬂavin, which leads to an increase in this vitamin concentration of about 2–3-fold in the ﬁnal product [ 11].It was shown in model rats with folic acid deﬁciency that yogurt fermented with the vitamin-producing strain L.plantarum GSLP-7 V restores the disturbed microbiota and increases levels of serum folate and homocysteine, while folic acid aggravated intestinal dysbiosis [12].
Moreover, vitamin production is considered a criterion in the functionality assessment in some studies—for example, on isolation of new LAB from various sources such as vegetable raw materials [13]. Vitamin-producing lactic acid bacteria and biﬁdobacteria strains may become potential candidates for their synthesis in vivo in the intestine after colonization [ 14].It is reported that LAB synthesizing folate and riboﬂavin can be used as an additional treatment in people suffering from inﬂammatory bowel diseases [ 15].To ensure the effects, LAB have to reach the colon in a viable state and be characterized by high stress tolerance when passing through the digestive tract (tolerance to acidic pH, bile, and proteolytic enzymes).These abilities refer to probiotic properties [ 16].In addition to stress tolerance, the strains should have a high aggregation ability, which is often associated with adhesion to the intestinal epithelium and colonization properties [ 17].
They will have more advantages over nonaggregated strains that can be easily removed from the intestinal environment [ 18]. In this study, for the ﬁrst time, the probiotic properties and B-vitamin-producing potential of various biﬁdobacteria and lactobacilli strains are evaluated in order to select the most promising candidates.Their stability under conditions that model the human gastrointestinal tract passage, autoaggregation ability, and ability to synthesize and ex- tracellularly accumulate water-soluble B vitamins are studied.The obtained results can be used in medicine, healthcare, the food industry, and farming in order to expand the applications of LAB and biﬁdobacteria.2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions The biﬁdobacteria strains B.adolescentis AC-1662, B.pseudolongum subsp.pseudolongum AC-1785, B.longum subsp.infantis AC-1912, B.breve AC-1911, B.longum subsp.longum AC-1665, and B.biﬁdum AC-1779 and lactic acid bacteria L.

To obtain the inoculate of lactobacilli, the strains were cultured in a de Man–Rogosa– Sharpe (MRS) broth [ 20].
To determine the ability of biﬁdobacteria and lactobacilli to produce B vitamins, a folic acid assay medium was used according to the Difco ™for- mula with some modiﬁcations in the composition (approximate formula per liter): 12.0 g casamino acids (tryptone) (T2559; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 40.0 g dextrose (361105; Roqquette, Lestrem, France); 20.0 g sodium citrate (141655; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); 0.2 g L-cystine (C8755; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 0.2 g DL- tryptophan (T3300; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 20.0 mg adenine sulfate (145815; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 20.0 mg guanine (G11950; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 20.0 mg uridine (U3003; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 2.0 mg thiamine hydrochloride (W332208; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 4.0 mg pyridoxine hydrochlo- ride (P6280; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 2.0 mg riboﬂavin (R9504; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 2.0 mg niacin (N4126; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 200.0 µg p-aminobenzoic acid (A9580; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 0.8 µg biotin (19606; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 1.0 g dipotassium phosphate (141512; PanReac Ap- plichem, Barcelona, Spain); 1.0 g monopotassium phosphate (141509; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); 0.4 g magnesium sulfate (142486; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); 20.0 mg sodium chloride (S9888; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 20.0 mg ferrous sulfate (1413624 PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); and 20.0 mg manganese sulfate (131413; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain) (pH adjusted to 7.0).
2.2. Tolerance to Simulated Human GI Tract The cultures were centrifuged (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany Centrifuge 5417C, 7000 rpm, 15 min) after 24 h of growth (daily culture) and washed once in a 1:1 v/vratio Microorganisms 2022 ,10, 470 4 of 16 with a Ringer solution of the following composition (g L−1): 8.69 sodium chloride (S9888; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 0.30 potassium chloride (191494; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); 0.48 calcium chloride (131232; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain), pH 6.4 [21].The precipitate was resuspended in simulated gastric juices (see below) in a 1:1.33 ratio [ 22] and incubated at 37◦C.Sampling was carried out for 20, 40, 60, and 90 min of the experiment for biﬁdobacteria and for 30, 60, and 90 min for lactobacilli and the viable cells was counted.After 90 min, the samples were centrifuged, the supernatant was decanted, and a medium simulating the conditions of the duodenum (see below) was added in a 1:3 v/vratio [ 22].
If the strain was found to completely lose viability in gastric juices, the simulated intestinal conditions test was repeated with fresh daily culture. Samples were taken at 60, 120, and 180 min.The effect of the bile medium on the viability of biﬁdobacteria and lactobacilli was also studied [ 22].The precipitates were obtained as described above and resuspended in a bile medium (1:1).The incubation was carried out at 37◦C with sampling at 60, 120, and 180 min.2.2.1.Preparation of Simulated Gastric Juices During the experiment, simulated gastric juices of the following composition (g L−1) were used: 3.50 dextrose (361105; Roqquette, Lestrem, France); 2.05 sodium chloride (S9888; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 0.60 potassium dihydrogen phosphate (A1043; Pan- Reac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); 0.11 calcium chloride (131232; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); and 0.37 potassium chloride (191494; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain), pH 2.0.
The solution was autoclaved at 115◦C for 20 min. The following com- ponents were sterilized by ﬁltration (0.2 µm, Millipore, St.Louis, MO, USA) and added to the solution after cooling: 0.05 g L−1pork bile (48305; Sigma, St.Louis, MO, USA); 0.10 g L−1lysozyme (CAS Number 9066-59-5; Cagliﬁcio Clerici S.p.A., Cadorago, Italy), and 13.30 mg L−1pepsin (12762; JSC “Plant of Endocrine Enzymes”, Moscow, Russia) [ 23].2.2.2.
Preparation of Simulated Duodenal Environment During the experiment, a medium [ 24,25] of the following composition (g L−1) was used: 6.43 sodium chloride (S9888; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 0.50 potassium chloride (191494; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); 0.21 calcium chloride (131232; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); 0.05 potassium dihydrogen phosphate (A1043; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); 0.05 magnesium chloride (131396; PanReac Ap- plichem, Barcelona, Spain); 5.67 sodium hydrogen carbonate (131638; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); 0.15 urea (U5378; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); albumin (CAS Number 9048-46-8; “Sonac Loenen BV”, GD Loenen, Netherlands); 10.00 pork bile (48305; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA); 1.00 lipase (CAS Number 9001-62-1; Cagliﬁcio Clerici S.p.A., Cadorago, Italy); and 6.00 pancreatin (A0585; Panreac, Barcelona Spain), pH 6.0.2.2.3.
Preparation of Bile Medium During the experiment, a medium [ 26] of the following composition was used: 30 mL of sodium chloride (S9888; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany), 175.3 g L−1solution; 68.3 mL of sodium hydrogen carbonate (131638; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain), 84.7 g L−1 solution; 4.2 mL of potassium chloride (191494; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain), 89.6 g L−1solution; 200 mL of hydrochloric acid (170266; LenReaktiv, Moscow, Russia), 37% w/v solution; 10 mL of urea (U5378; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany), 25 g L−1solu- tion; 10 mL of calcium chloride dihydrate (121214; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain), 22.2 g L−1solution; albumin (CAS Number 9048-46-8; “Sonac Loenen BV ,” Netherlands), 1.8 g L−1; and pork bile (48305; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 6.0 g L−1, pH 8.0.2.2.4.Tolerance to Enzyme Preparations The tolerance of microorganisms to pepsin and pancreatin was evaluated separately.
The bacterial cell precipitate was resuspended in the buffered enzyme (pancreatine or Microorganisms 2022 ,10, 470 5 of 16 pepsin) solution in a 1:1.33 ratio. The enzyme solutions were previously sterilized by ﬁltration (0.22 µm, Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY, USA) [22,27].To obtain the pancreatin (A0585; Panreac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain) solution (6 g L−1), a phosphate buffer of the following composition (g L−1) was used: 8.00 sodium chloride (S9888; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany); 0.24 sodium hydrogen phosphate (131679; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); 0.20 potassium chloride (191494; PanReac Applichem, Barcelona, Spain); 0.24 potassium dihydrogen phosphate (A1043; PanReac Ap- plichem, Barcelona, Spain) [ 28], pH 7.0.Pepsin (12762; JSC “Plant of Endocrine enzymes”, Moscow, Russia) was dissolved in the citrate–HCl buffer (pH 3.0) at 13.5 g L−1[23,25].
To prepare the citrate–HCl buffer at pH 3.0, 21.0 g of citric acid (C2404; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) was dissolved in 200 mL of 1 M NaOH, brought up to 1 L with distilled water, and 40.3 mL of this solution was diluted with 0.1 M HCl to 100.0 mL [29]. 2.3.Determination of Total Viable Count and Survival Percentage Enumeration of Lactobacillus strains viable cells (CFU mL−1) was carried out by plating 10-fold dilutions of the samples in sterile PBS on MRS agar.Plates were incubated at 37±1◦Cfor 48 h.Enumeration of Biﬁdobacterium strains’ viable cells (CFU mL−1) was carried out by plating 10-fold dilutions of the samples in sterile PBS on Biﬁdum agar.Plates were incubated under anaerobic conditions provided by the BD GasPak ™(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) anaerobic container system at 37 ±1◦C for 48 h.Counting was performed in triplicate and the results are expressed as log 10(CFU mL−1).
The survival percentage was calculated as the percentage of LAB or Biﬁdobacterium colonies grown on MRS or Biﬁdum agar compared to the initial bacterial concentration: % survival percentage =log CFU of viable cells survived log CFU of initial viable cells inoculated×100. (1) 2.4.Spectrophotometry Autoaggregation Assays The ability to autoaggregate was tested as described by Collado, Meriluoto, and Salminen [ 18] according to the autoaggregate percentage.The cells were harvested after 24 h of incubation by centrifugation (3200 ×g, 4◦C, 20 min), washed twice with a phosphate– salt buffer (PBS: 130 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2), resuspended in the same buffer under sterile conditions, adjusted to OD 600= 0.25 ±0.05, and incubated at 37◦C.OD was controlled at different time intervals (0, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h).
The percentage of autoaggregation was expressed according to: A%=(A0−At)/A0∗100, (2) where A0is the absorption ( A600nm) at 0 h and Atis the absorption ( A600nm) at different time intervals (0, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h). 2.5.Determination of Water-Soluble B Vitamins The analysis of water-soluble B vitamins free forms and their concentrations in the fer- mentation broth of probiotic bacteria was carried out with a capillary electrophoresis system “Kapel-105M” (Lumex Ltd., St.Petersburg, Russia) with positive polarity, equipped with a special geometry quartz capillary similar to amino acid (pore inner diameter 50 microns , total/effective length 75/65 cm) and the specialized software Elforun®(S-Pb, St.Peters- burg, Russia).The preparation of samples for research consisted of the microbial cells’ precipitation using an Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 7500 rpm for 10 min.
After that, the supernatants were placed in Amicon Ultra-15 cen- trifuge concentrators (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with a 3 kDa pore diameter cellulose membrane and centrifuged for 15 min at 7500 rpm for complete puriﬁcation. Separation, identiﬁcation, and determination of the concentrations of water-soluble vitamins thiamine (B1), riboﬂavin (B2), pantothenic acid (B3), pyridoxine (B6), and folic acid (Bc) were carried out by capillary zone electrophoresis (CSE), and that of the vitamin nicotinamide (B5) by Microorganisms 2022 ,10, 470 6 of 16 micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) according to the practical guidelines for the use of “Kapel” capillary electrophoresis systems [ 30].
Detection conditions for vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, and Bc: capillary: quartz, 50 microns, 75 cm; voltage + 25 kV; wavelength at the beginning of the analysis 200 nm, after the detection peak B1 267 nm, after the peak B2 and before the end of the analysis 200 nm; temperature 30◦C; pressure at the beginning of the analysis 0 mbar, after the peak B6-30 mbar until the end of the analysis. Detection conditions for vitamin B5: capillary: quartz, 50 microns, 75 cm; voltage +25 kV; wavelength 200 nm; temperature 40◦C; pressure 0 mbar.The standards (HPLC grade) of all B vitamins for calibration were purchased from Lumex, Ltd.All samples were tested in triplicate.2.6.Statistical Analysis All the measurements were performed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the mean with standard deviation ( ±SD).The data were analyzed by an ANOVA test with Tukey’s multiple comparison using MathLab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) software.Statistical signiﬁcance was determined at p= 0.05.3.
Results 3.1. Stress Tolerance Ability 3.1.1.Tolerance of Biﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus Strains to Simulated Gastric Juices The standard conditions for incubation in real or simulated gastric juices have not been fully developed yet [ 31].However, it is known that, depending on the consumed food and beverages, incubation time in the stomach can vary from 15 to 194 min [ 32].Therefore, to simulate the presence of lactobacilli and biﬁdobacteria in the stomach, an incubation period of 90 min was determined.As the death rate of biﬁdobacteria will be greater than that of lactobacilli, the measurements for the strains of Biﬁdobacterium genus were carried out more frequently.In this case, only the ﬁnal results of the test (after 90 min) are applicable for intergenera comparison.The results of the research on the survival of six biﬁdobacteria strains and 10 lactobacilli strains during the incubation in simulated gastric juices at pH 2.0 for 1.5 h are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
Each tested strain of biﬁdobacteria demonstrated a considerable decrease in the viable cell count during the ﬁrst 30 min of incubation. The strains of B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662, B.pseudolongum subsp.pseudolongum VKPM AC-1785, and B.breve VKPM AC-1911 showed the highest tolerance to the effects of simulated gastric juices.The marked decrease in the population was observed in the B.longum subsp.infantis VKPM A C-1912, B.longum subsp.longum VKPM AC-1665, and B.biﬁdum VKPM AC-1779 strains.The strain B.biﬁdum VKPM AC-1779 was characterized by the decay of viable cells after 40 min of exposure.Table 2.Tolerance of Biﬁdobacterium strains to simulated gastric juices (pH 2.0).StrainSurvival Percentage (% ±SD) Time (min) 20 40 60 90 B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662 95 ±0.4a81±0.9a71±0.2a67±0.7a B.pseudolongum subsp.pseudolongum VKPM AC-1785 88±0.9b86±1.1b63±0.4b65±0.8b B.longum subsp.infantis VKPM AC-1912 75 ±0.2c54±0.9c0c0c B.breve VKPM AC-1911 81±1.1d60±0.6d60±0.2d60±0.8d B.longum subsp.

The superscripts indicate statistically signiﬁcant differences ( p< 0.05) within each time comparison. All the studied lactobacillus strains also demonstrated a decrease in the viable cell count under the model conditions of simulated gastric juices (Table 3).The strain L.sakei VKPM B-8936 demonstrated the greatest resistance to low pH values, while L.salivarius VKPM B-2214 had the lowest.Total inactivation of the lactobacillus population was not observed for any strain after 1.5 h of incubation.3.1.2.Tolerance of Biﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus Strains to the Simulated Duodenal Environment The time of food transit via the small intestine is usually 1 to 4 h, which gives a total transit time in the upper gastrointestinal tract of 3 to 8 h [ 33].Therefore, in order to simulate the passing of lactobacilli and biﬁdobacteria in the intestine, the incubation period of 3 h was established.
The viability of lactobacilli after 3 h in the duodenum-simulating conditions was comparatively higher than in biﬁdobacteria (Tables 4 and 5). At the same time, the survival rate of both lactobacilli and biﬁdobacteria was strain-speciﬁc and differed between the cultures.Table 4.Tolerance of Biﬁdobacterium strains to simulated duodenal environment (pH 6.0).StrainSurvival Percentage (% ±SD) Time (min) 60 120 180 B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662 100 ±0.02a100±0.03a98±0.7a B.pseudolongum subsp.pseudolongum VKPM AC-1785 100 ±0.03a92±1.6b80±2.1b B.longum subsp.infantis VKPM AC-1912 96±1.7b86±0.4c86±1.5c B.breve VKPM AC-1911 89 ±1.0c92±0.5b80±0.6b B.longum subsp.longum VKPM AC-1665 87±0.8d87±0.5c87±0.2c B.biﬁdum VKPM AC-1779 89 ±1.1c87±0.9c87±1.3c Values are the mean ±SD of three determinations of three replicates.The superscripts indicate statistically signiﬁcant differences ( p< 0.05) within each time comparison.The strain B.

The greatest sensitivity to the conditions of the intestinal environment was demonstrated by the biﬁdobacteria B.pseudolongum subsp.pseudolongum VKPM AC-1785 and B.breve VKPM AC-1911 strains, which had the survival percentage of 80% after 3 h of incubation.Among lactobacilli, the lowest decrease in population was observed in the L.plantarum VKPM B-11007 and L.acidophilus VKPM B-2213 strains.The survival rate of the L.salivarius VKPM B-2214 strain was the lowest.Microorganisms 2022 ,10, 470 8 of 16 Table 5.Tolerance of Lactobacillus strains to simulated duodenal environment (pH 6.0).StrainSurvival Percentage (% ±SD) Time (min) 60 120 180 L.acidophilus VKPM B-2105 91 ±1.7a90±0.9a89±0.6a L.plantarum VKPM B-11007 100±0.03b99±0.4b99±0.6b L.acidophilus VKPM B-6551 100±0.04b86±1.1c85±0.9c L.acidophilus VKPM B-2213 100±0.04b100±0.03b99±0.4b L.salivarius VKPM B-2214 95 ±0.4c84±1.6d84±1.9c L.

Total death of microorganisms occurred after 1 h of incubation The results of the research on the sensitivity of lactobacilli to pepsin and pancreatin are shown in Tables 6 and 7.

If the survival rate of lactobacilli after 3 h of incubation with pancreatin was about 90% for all the cultures, the sensitivity to pepsin greatly varied between the strains, reaching 60% in some cases. Thus, the strain L.paracasei subsp.paracasei VKPM B-4079 demonstrated the lowest tolerance to pepsin, and L.acidophilus VKPM B-2213 the greatest.3.1.4.Tolerance of Biﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus Strains to Bile The results of the study on bile’s effect on the viability of biﬁdobacteria and lactic acid bacteria strains are shown in Tables 8 and 9.Almost every strain considered showed a decrease in the population of viable cells.The most sensitive to the presence of bile in the medium was the B.breve VKPM AC-1911 strain (the survival rate was 70%).The B.biﬁdum VKPM AC-1779 strain was characterized by the greatest resistance to the effects of bile; the survival rate hardly changed (about 99%).Table 8.Tolerance of Biﬁdobacterium strains to bile.

acidophilus VKPM B-6551, L. acidophilus VKPM B-2213, and L.rhamnosus VKPM B-8238 have a high potential ability to attach to epithelial cells and mucosal surfaces.3.3.The Study of Lactic Acid Bacteria’s and Biﬁdobacteria’s Ability to Accumulate B Vitamins Extracellularly While studying the ability of lactic acid bacteria and biﬁdobacteria to produce B vita- mins, it was assumed that, if a speciﬁc vitamin was found in the supernatant, the considered strain was able not only to synthesize, but also to excrete vitamins simultaneously with their accumulation in the medium.The results of the studies are presented in Tables 12 and 13.Based on the results, each biﬁdobacteria culture considered consumed nicotinamide (its concentration was higher in the medium before fermentation).The riboﬂavin that was detected in the nutrient medium was consumed by all cultures except B.adolescentis AC1662 and B.longum subsp.
infantis AC-1912, which excrete it in the medium, such that an increase in concentration was observed. The ability to accumulate pyridoxine extracellularly was found in B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662, B.pseudolongum subsp.pseudolongum VKPM AC- 1785, B.longum subsp.infantis VKPM AC-1912, and B.longum VKPM AC-1665, among which the maximum amount was detected for the last one.Thiamine, pantothenic acid, and folic acid were not detected in the supernatant of the fermentation broths.Microorganisms 2022 ,10, 470 11 of 16 Table 12.Concentration of B vitamins in biﬁdobacteria fermentation broths.StrainVitamin Concentrations, mg L−1 Thiamine (B1) Riboﬂavin (B2) Pantothenic Acid (B3) Nicotinamide (B5) Pyridoxine (B6) Folic Acid (Bc) B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662 — 2.180 ±0.021 — 1.462 ±0.040 7.974 ±0.040 — B.pseudolongum VKPM AC-1785— — — 1.554 ±0.020 20.680 ±0.080 — B.longum subsp.infantis VKPM AC-1912— 2.009 ±0.011 — 44.130 ±0.100 0.988 ±0.010 — B.

Folic acid was detected in the fermentation broths of L. salivarius VKPM B-2214 and L.acidophilus VKPM B-6553.Among the Lactobacillus strains considered, L.salivarius VKPM B-2214 is of the greatest interest since the pantothenic acid concentration reached 138.600 mg L−1in the fermentation broth.4.Discussion Carrying out proper in vitro studies to screen potential probiotic strains is a necessary ﬁrst step before in vivo experiments to establish the possible health beneﬁts of probi- otics [ 34].An important evaluation criterion during the selection is stress tolerance to passing through the digestive tract, which characterizes the resistance of the probiotics to acid and bile, as well as the production of antimicrobial compounds and the ability to aggregate with intestinal cells [ 34,35].The acidic gastric juices and bile salts are the main obstacle to the survival of probiotic bacteria and reaching the distal part of the intestine [ 36].
The results obtained in our research show that the stress tolerance of biﬁdobacteria and lactobacilli to the effects of low pH, proteolytic enzymes, and bile varies greatly, both between species and between strains of the given species. The effect of artiﬁcial gastric Microorganisms 2022 ,10, 470 12 of 16 juices on biﬁdobacteria strains led to the death of B.longum subsp.infantis VKPM AC-1912, B.longum subsp.longum VKPM AC-1665, and B.biﬁdum VKPM AC-1779.Similar results were reported by Charteris et al.[ 37], who showed a lack of resistance to simulated gastric conditions (pH 2.0 for 90 min) in the B.biﬁdum ,B.animalis ,B.infantis ,B.breve , and B.adolescentis strains.Strong differences in resistance to low pH between strains within the species B.longum were observed by Izquierdo et al.[ 38].In our study, the B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662 strain, which was isolated from the human intestine, was characterized by the greatest acid resistance.
The effect of the model duodenum conditions on the biﬁdobacteria survival was less harmful, and the survival rate for all strains was above 80%. The strain B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662 also showed the highest stability.When comparing the tolerance of the tested lactobacilli and biﬁdobacteria to the gas- trointestinal tract model conditions, the higher resistance of the former was anticipated.They were resistant to both simulated gastric juices and bile.Acid resistance is a charac- teristic of most lactobacillus species due to their ability to control intracellular pH [ 39].Some of them (e.g., Lactobacillus casei ,Lactobacillus reuteri ,Lactobacillus vaginalis ,Lactobacillus fermentum , and Lactobacillus casei ) may be members of the gastric microbial community [ 40].In our research, the strain L.sakei VKPM B-8936 showed the greatest resistance to low pH.Similar results were reported by Song et al.[ 41], who showed the acid resistance of the Lactobacillus sp.NN 8829, L.casei MB3, L.
sakei MA9, and L. sakei CH8 strains under incuba- tion conditions at pH 2.5.Thus, the obtained data are generally consistent with the results presented earlier.On the other hand, taking into account the conﬁrmed strain-speciﬁc tolerance, the accumulation of information on new strains is theoretically and practically valuable.The experiment dedicated to the treatment of biﬁdobacteria populations sepa- rately with pepsin and pancreatin led to the death of all tested strains.Lactobacilli were more resistant to the effects of proteolytic enzymes.The greater sensitivity of lactobacilli was marked in the experiments with pepsin.The bacterial cell aggregation of probiotic strains is often associated with potential ability to adhere to the intestinal epithelium and mucous membranes [ 17].In most cases, bacterial autoaggregation is mediated by homotypic interactions between surface pro- teins [ 42].
The tested cultures of lactic acid bacteria and biﬁdobacteria demonstrated some degree of autoaggregation, which differed greatly between the strains. The strains B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662, B.longum subsp.longum VKPM AC-1665, and B.biﬁdum VKPM AC-1779, isolated from the intestines of adults, showed strong autoaggregation ability.Among lactobacilli, the highest percentage of autoaggregation was observed in L.salivarius VKPM B-2214, isolated from human saliva.It was also characterized by the strong dependence of bacterial cells’ aggregation on exposure time, which was greatest after 24 h.It was reported previously that L.acidophilus is characterized by high values of autoaggregation [ 43].In our study, high autoaggregation ability was also observed in L.acidophilus VKPM B-6551, L.acidophilus VKPM B-2213, and L.rhamnosus VKPM B-8238.The reference probiotic bacteria, e.g., L.rhamnosus GG or L.
casei Shirota, can be applied in research on probiotic properties to improve the reliability of the data comparison [ 44–46]. The lack of a reference probiotic can be considered a limitation of our study.However, it should be noted that the standards were not used in the numerous works mentioned above.The FAO/WHO guidelines [ 47] also do not establish strict requirements.Moreover, discrepancies in the data on the stress tolerance of the same reference strain and in the same tests were noted between studies.The analysis of the obtained results on lactic acid bacteria’s and biﬁdobacteria’s ability to extracellularly production of water-soluble B vitamins showed that the consumption of some vitamins detected in the nutrient medium before fermentation and the excretion of others into fermentation broths occurred.So, riboﬂavin was not consumed by B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662 and B.longum subsp.infantis VKPM AC-1912.Hou et al.
[ 48] showed that fermentation of soy milk with Biﬁdobacterium longum B6 and B. infantis CCRC 14633 cultures increases the content of riboﬂavin.Pyridoxine accumulation was observed in the strains of B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662, B.pseudolongum subsp.pseudolongum VKPM AC-1785, B.Microorganisms 2022 ,10, 470 13 of 16 longum subsp.infantis VKPM AC-1912, and B.longum VKPM AC-1665.The obtained results are consistent with the data of Deguchi, Morishita and Mutai [ 49], who linked the ability to synthesize certain vitamins with the species and strain.The extracellular synthesis of folic acid was demonstrated in the studies of Deguchi, Morishita and Mutai [ 50] and Pompei et al.[ 50], but it was not detected for the considered strains.Although Biﬁdobacterium biﬁdum and Biﬁdobacterium longum subsp.infantis are classiﬁed as species/strains with a high level of biosynthetic properties of folic acid [50].
The B vitamins’ extracellular synthesis by lactobacilli was poor, especially when modern techniques such as capillary electrophoresis were applied. In our study, the ability to excrete thiamine, folic acid, and pantothenic acid was considered for some strains of lactobacilli.L.salivarius VKPM B-2214 is of interest due to its ability to produce up to 138.600 mg L−1of pantothenic acid.Thus, B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662 can be considered the best candidate for probi- otics, since it is characterized by the greatest stress tolerance and a high autoaggregation percentage, as well as the ability to accumulate riboﬂavin and pyridoxine extracellularly.The application of folate-producing biﬁdobacteria has already been shown in rats [ 51] and humans [ 52].On the other hand, data on the correlation of the synthesis of B vitamins in vitro and in the intestine are poor; additional research is required, which may involve signiﬁcant methodological difﬁculties.
Among the lactic acid bacteria, the greatest toler- ance to low pH values was demonstrated by L. sakei VKPM B-8936; L.plantarum VKPM B-11007 showed tolerance to duodenal conditions, L.acidophilus VKPM B-2213 to pepsin, and L.salivarius VKPM B-2214 to pancreatin.The highest autoaggregation percentage was observed in L.salivarius VKPM B-2214, which also accumulated the most pantothenic acid of the studied strains.L.casei VKPM B-2873 and L.rhamnosus VKPM B-8238 was also char- acterized by the accumulation of thiamine and pyridoxine in addition to pantothenic acid.These strains of lactobacilli have the potential to be used as starter cultures in functional product manufacturing.5.Conclusions In this research, for the ﬁrst time, the combined assessment of the probiotic and vitamin-producing potential of various biﬁdobacteria and lactobacilli species and strains was carried out in order to select potential probiotics with high stress tolerance and the ability to synthesize B vitamins.
The selected strains with the best characteristics, such as L. salivarius VKPM B-2214, L.casei VKPM B-2873, and L.rhamnosus VKPM B-8238, can be used as potential starter cultures to increase B vitamins in a number of probiotic foods.B.adolescentis VKPM AC-1662 can be introduced in the diet as a probiotic, potentially capable to synthetize B vitamins in vivo in the intestine.The conducted studies of lactobacilli and biﬁdobacteria strains, devoted to the ability to extracellularly produce B vitamins in combination with the assessment of probiotic properties, can be considered the ﬁrst stage in their introduction for commercial use.It should be pointed out that studies on B vitamin accumulation in the bacterial biomass, as well as their production in other nutrient media, have not been carried out in this work.
Therefore, research into both the effect of various cultivation conditions on the accumulation of B vitamins (in order to increase their concentrations), and the fermentation of the strains in other nutrient media (including milk or plant substrates) should be undertaken in the future.
