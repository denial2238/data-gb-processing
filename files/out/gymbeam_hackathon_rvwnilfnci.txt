Neurobiology Gestational Vitamin B Deficiency Leads to Homocysteine-Associated Brain Apoptosis andAlters Neurobehavioral Development in Rats Se´bastien A.Blaise,* Emmanuelle Ne ´de´lec,* Henri Schroeder,†Jean-Marc Alberto,* Carine Bossenmeyer-Pourie ´,* Jean-Louis Gue ´ant,* and Jean-Luc Daval* From Unite ´ 724, *Institut National de la Sante ´ et de la Recherche ´ Me´dicale, Faculte ´d eM e ´decine, Vandoeuvre-le `s-Nancy; and Neurosciences Comportementales,†Institut National de la Recherche ´ Agronomique, Faculte ´ des Sciences, Vandoeuvre-le ´s- Nancy, France Hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as a risk factor for neurological disorders.To study the influ-ence of early deficiency in nutritional determinantsof hyperhomocysteinemia on the developing ratbrain, dams were fed a standard diet or a diet lackingmethyl groups during gestation and lactation.
Homo-cysteinemia progressively increased in the offspringof the deficient group and at 21 days reached 13.3 /H11550 3.7 /H9262mol/L versus 6.8 /H115500.3/H9262mol/L in controls. Ho- mocysteine accumulated in both neurons and astro-cytes of selective brain structures including the hip-pocampus, the cerebellum, the striatum, and theneurogenic subventricular zone.Most homocysteine-positive cells expressed p53 and displayed frag-mented DNA indicative of apoptosis.Righting reflexand negative geotaxis revealed a delay in the onset ofintegration capacities in the deficient group.Between19 and 21 days, a poorer success score was recordedin deficient animals in a locomotor coordination test.A switch to normal food after weaning allowed resto-ration of normal homocysteinemia.
Nevertheless, at80 days of age, the exploratory behavior in the elevated-plus maze and the learning and memory behavior in theeight-arm maze revealed that early vitamin B depriva-tion is associated with persistent functional disabilities,possibly resulting from the ensuing neurotoxic effectsof homocysteine. (Am J Pathol 2007, 170:667–679; DOI: 10.2353/ajpath.2007.060339) The sulfur-containing amino acid homocysteine (Hcy) is a metabolite of the essential amino acid methionine.It caneither be remethylated to methionine by enzymes that require folate (vitamin B9) or cobalamin (vitamin B12) orbe catabolized by cystathionine /H9252-synthase (CBS) to generate cysteine.1Depending on genetic, dietary, and environmental factors, Hcy levels may vary considerablyamong individuals, and elevated plasma concentrationshave been identified as a risk factor for a wide range ofpathological situations, such as cardiovascular diseases,stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases.
2–5Clinically, it is usually considered that in adults the normal range ofHcy concentration in plasma is 5 to 10 /H9262mol/L, and plasma levels of 12 to 15 /H9262mol/L Hcy have been associ- ated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular and neuro-degenerative diseases. 3,6During pregnancy, severe complications have been associated with hyperhomo-cysteinemia, and the disturbance of maternal and fetalHcy metabolism attributable to folate or vitamin B12shortage has been shown to play a role in the etiology ofrecurrent early pregnancy loss, placental abruption, and preeclampsia, as well as intrauterine growth retardationand neural tube defects.7–9In addition, the prevalence of folate and vitamin B12 deficiency in the context of preg-nancy is relatively high, especially in some countries fromsub-Saharan Africa and North Europe, 10–12and an ele- vated Hcy level in the mother is usually recorded duringthe last trimester of pregnancy.
13Taken together, these observations encourage studies on long-term conse-quences of a dietary regimen that can influence homo-cysteinemia during the early period of life. Particularlylittle is known about the effects of increased homocys-teinemia in fetuses and neonates on their subsequentbrain development, especially at the functional level.Kru-man and colleagues 14have reported that exposure to low concentrations of Hcy can trigger apoptosis in cul-tured hippocampal neurons from the embryonic rat brain,suggesting that the amino acid may directly exert ad- Supported by the Institut National de la Sante ´ et de la Recherche Me ´di- cale (Inserm) and the ‘Re ´gion Lorraine’ (to S.A.B.).Accepted for publication October 25, 2006.Address reprint requests to Jean-Luc Daval, Ph.D., Inserm U.724, Faculte ´d eM e ´decine, 9 Avenue de la Fore ˆt de Haye, B.P.184, 54500 Vandoeuvre-le `s-Nancy, France.E-mail: jean-luc.daval@nancy.inserm.fr.The American Journal of Pathology, Vol.170, No.

Likewise, cytotoxic ef- fects of Hcy have been reported on rat astrocytes in vitro.15We have recently designed a new, clinically rele - vant model for studying the consequences of a vitaminB-deficient diet during gestation on Hcy metabolism inthe newborn rat.16In the present study, we have used this model to investigate in vivo the long-term neurophys- iological effects of an early deficiency in nutritional deter-minants of hyperhomocysteinemia in the developing rat.Materials and Methods Animal Treatments Animal experiments were performed on Wistar rats (Charles River, l’Arbresle, France) and were conducted inaccordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidefor the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Adult femalerats were maintained under standard laboratory condi-tions, on a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with food and wateravailable ad libitum . One month before pregnancy, they were fed with either standard food ( n/H110058) (maintenance diet M20; Scientific Animal Food and Engineering, Ville-moisson-sur-Orge, France) or with a diet lacking methyldonors, ie, vitamins B12, B2, folate, and choline ( n/H110058) (Special Diet Service, Saint-Gratien, France), accordingto Blaise and colleagues.16Choline was eliminated from the diet because the alternative pathway for the methyl- ation of Hcy to form methionine is catalyzed by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.5), which usesbetaine, a metabolite of choline, as the methyl groupdonor.The assigned diet was constantly maintained untilweaning of the offspring (ie, postnatal day 21); thereafter,all pups were fed with standard food until 80 days of age.
Sample Collection In some experiments, blood samples were collected fromthe tail in living animals. Otherwise, rat pups were sacri-ficed by excess halothane at various developmentalstages (2, 5, 21, or 80 days).Intracardiac blood sampleswere drawn for the measurement of plasma concentra-tions of vitamin B12, folate, and Hcy, and the whole brain,including cerebellum, was rapidly harvested.For immu-nohistochemical analyses, brains were immediately fro-zen in methylbutane previously chilled to /H1100230°C and stored at /H1100280°C.For metabolic studies, brain tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen.They were then lysed at4°C in 100 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3)containing protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor cocktail;Sigma Chemicals, St.Louis, MO), and proteins sampleswere quantified according to Bradford.
17 Measurements of Vitamin B12, Folate, and Hcy Concentrations Plasma and cerebral concentrations of vitamin B12 and folate were determined by radio-dilution isotope assay(simulTRAC-SNB; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa,CA). 13Hcy concentrations were assessed by fluorescent polarization immunoassay (IMX system; Abbott, Fornebu, Norway).12In addition, vitamin B2 status has been as - sessed by measuring the erythrocyte glutathione reduc-tase activation coefficient that corresponds to the ratiobetween enzyme activities determined with and withoutthe addition of the co-factor FAD.18 Activities of CBS and Methionine Synthase (MS) Each enzymatic activity was measured on tissue samplescorresponding to 400 /H9262g of total proteins.
CBS activity was monitored by a method adapted from Taoka andcolleagues, 19and MS activity by a method adapted from Chen and colleagues,20as previously described by Blaise and colleagues.16In addition, in an attempt to evaluate the methylation status of brain cells, the concen- trations of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosyl- homocysteine (SAH) were monitored in brain tissuehomogenates. For this purpose, the technique usingsolid-phase extraction and high-performance liquidchromatography was adapted from Delabar and col-leagues.21Proteins were precipitated with 0.2 N HClO4, before injection on the column (Lichrospher, 100 RP-C18, 5/H9262m, 250 /H110034 mm ID).The mobile phase was applied at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/minute and consisted of 50 mmol/Lsodium phosphate (pH 3.2), 10 mmol/L heptan sulfonate,and acetonitrile (10 to 20% from 0 to 20 minutes).Amounts of SAM and SAH were quantified by using anUV detector at 254 nm.
MS and CBS mRNA Assays MS and CBS transcripts were analyzed as previouslydescribed by Blaise and colleagues. 16Total RNAs were isolated from brain tissues using the RNeasy minikit from Qiagen (Courtaboeuf, France) and quantified by spectro-photometry.After control of RNA integrity, total RNA (2 /H9262g) was reverse-transcribed using hexamer random primers and Omniscript (Qiagen) in a 20- /H9262l-volume reac- tion of a buffered mixture containing 0.5 mmol/L dNTP.The cDNA products were diluted twofold, and 2 /H9262l were used as a template for each amplification in polymerasechain reaction (PCR).Reactions were performed withTaqDNA polymerase (Gibco Invitrogen Corp., Cergy Pontoise, France) in 50 /H9262l of a buffered solution contain- ing 0.5 mmol/L dNTP, and 0.5 /H9262mol/L of each primer.
Separate PCR for MS, CBS, and L-27 (internal standard)amplification were undertaken with the following oligonu-cleotide primers: MS (NM 030864, 228-bp product),sense 5 /H11032-CAGATATAATTGGCTTGTCAGGACT-3 /H11032, anti- sense 5 /H11032-TTTCATCTAACAGCTGAGAACACAC-3 /H11032; CBS (NM 012522, 350-bp product), sense 5 /H11032-TTCCCCACAT- TACCACACAG-3 /H11032, anti-sense 5 /H11032-AGCACATCCACCT- TCTCCAT-3 /H11032; and L-27 (NM 022514, 364-bp product), sense 5 /H11032-GCTGTCGAAATGGGCAAGTT-3 /H11032, anti-sense 5/H11032CAAACTTGACCTTGGCCTCC3 /H11032. Conditions of PCR al- lowing to be in the exponential phase of PCR were for MS:number of cycles ( n)/H1100531, annealing temperature (AT) /H11005 61°C; for CBS, n/H1100530, AT /H1100556°C; for L-27, n/H1100527, AT /H11005668 Blaise et al AJP February 2007, Vol.170, No.2 62°C.
Amplification products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromidestaining, and quantified by densitometry with ImageMas-ter 1D Primer software and ImageMaster apparatus (Am-ersham Pharmacia Biotech, Quebec, QC, Canada). Am-plicons were selective in amplifying the desired targetmRNA.Results were expressed relatively to the mRNAlevels of the housekeeping gene L27 for ribosomal protein.Immunohistochemical Detection of Hcy and Apoptotic Cells Immunohistochemical analyses were performed on cry- ostat-generated 20- /H9262m sagittal brain sections mounted onto glass slides, as described by Daval and col-leagues.22For Hcy immunostaining, tissue sections were incubated in 2 N HCl for 45 minutes at room temperature followed by a 10-minute wash in 0.1 mol/L sodium borateat pH 8.5.
Slides were dipped in phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS) for 10 minutes, then in PBS containing 10%bovine serum for 1 hour, and were incubated overnight at4°C with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Hcy dilutedat 1/100 (Chemicon Int., Temecula, CA). Brain sliceswere then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in thepresence of a secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG con-jugated to Alexa Fluor, 1/100; Molecular Probes, CergyPontoise, France).To identify the phenotype of Hcy-positive cells, tissue sections were also processed for the immunological de-tection of NeuN (a neuronal marker) or glial fibrillary acidprotein (GFAP, a marker for astrocytes).The experimen-tal protocol was as described above by using a mousemonoclonal antibody against NeuN (1/100; Santa CruzBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or a mouse monoclonalantibody against GFAP (1/200, Chemicon Int.) followedby the second-step antibody (anti-mouse IgG conjugatedto Alexa Fluor, 1/1000; Molecular Probes).
For the specific detection of apoptosis, the method initially described by Frankfurt and Krishan 23was used. Tissue sections previously fixed in 5% paraformaldehyde (4°C for 24 hours) were incubated in 50% formamide at56°C for 30 minutes.After washing with phosphate buffer(PBS), tissue was blocked in PBS containing 10% bovineserum for 1 hour and then incubated overnight at 4°C withApostain F7-26 monoclonal antibody (AbCys SA, Paris,France) specific to single-stranded DNA.Brain sectionswere then rinsed with PBS and incubated for 1 hour withAlexa Fluor-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (1/1000; Molec-ular Probes).According to the manufacturer, F7-26monoclonal antibody can be used in combination withanother antibody, and co-labeling experiments were con-ducted with Hcy antibody.A test with bovine serum al-bumin and Hcy antibody was previously done to ensurethe specificity of Hcy antibody after tissue incubation informamide at 56°C.
In addition, expression of the apo-ptosis-related protein p53 was analyzed in brain sectionsby means of a rabbit monoclonal antibody against p53diluted at 1/100 (Santa Cruz) and its corresponding sec-ondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to AlexaFluor; Molecular Probes). In all cases, control experi- ments were conducted by processing adjacent sectionsin the same way except that the primary antibody wasomitted.
For quantification of specifically labeled cells, total cell density in definite brain areas was calculated after stain-ing cell nuclei by the fluorescent dye 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (0.5 /H9262g/ml in PBS; Sigma), accord- ing to Wolvetang and colleagues.24The number of cell nuclei was scored at 365 nm under fluorescence micros- copy (Axioscop; Zeiss, Strasbourg, France) at a /H1100340 magnification in at least six separate experiments bycounting cells with their nuclei present in the focal planein three distinct section areas delineated by an oculargrid of 1/400 mm 2, and the amounts of cells exhibiting any of the selective markers were calculated as a per- centage of total cells. DAPI staining was also used athigher magnification for chromatin observation and de-tection of apoptosis hallmarks.
Assessment of Neurobehavioral Development Righting Reflex The static righting reflex was studied as described by Schroeder and colleagues.25The time needed by the pup to right itself in a supine position was recorded for 3 consecutive days (postnatal days 3 to 5). Negative Geotaxis This reflex was tested at postnatal days 8, 9, and 10.The rat was positioned with the head downward on aninclined plane with a 20% slope.The time needed for thepup to turn completely and reach a position with the headupward on the plane was measured.The duration of thetest was limited to 120 seconds.25 Suspension Time The test was performed at postnatal day 10.The rat pup was suspended by its front paws grasping a metalrod (1-mm diameter) that was stretched between the twopoles of a frame at /H1101120 cm above the table.A Plexiglas sheet was placed in front of the rat to prevent it fromturning around the rod.The time the animal remained onthe bar was recorded.
This test was performed beforeeyelid opening to control muscle strength by itself andeliminate the participation of emotivity. 25 Locomotor Coordination This test adapted by Schroeder and colleagues25was performed at postnatal days 19, 20, and 21.It is divided into three phases, and its total duration is limited to 300seconds.During the first phase of the test, the rat isforced to swim in a round container (15-cm diameter and23-cm height) half full of water.The animal is able tocome out of the water by climbing along a metal rod(8-mm diameter) that is deep enough inside the water soEffects of Early Vitamin B Deficiency 669 AJP February 2007, Vol.170, No.2 that the rat necessarily encounters it during the swimming phase.The second phase represents the climbing periodalong the rod (35 cm).During the third phase, the animalreaches a platform on which it can restore a normalquadruped position after the climbing task.
The timenecessary for the rat to succeed, ie, to reach the platformwith the four paws after being put inside the water, wasrecorded. Respective times necessary to complete eachof the three different phases of the test were alsomeasured.Elevated-Plus Maze The elevated-plus maze is a validated test that eval- uates anxiety in rodents.26The apparatus was made of transparent Plexiglas.It comprises two open arms (50/H1100310 cm), two enclosed arms (10 /H1100340/H1100350 cm), and a central platform (10 /H1100310 cm).The configuration has the shape of a plus sign, and the apparatus iselevated 80 cm above the floor level.Grip on the openarms is facilitated by inclusion of a small edge (0.5 cmhigh) around their perimeter.Rats were tested at 80days.They were brought to the room 2 hours before thetest and were tested individually.Before each trial, themaze was cleaned thoroughly with a 30% ethanol so-lution.
At the beginning of the test, rats were placed onthe central platform, always facing the same open arm.The test lasted 5 minutes in standard laboratory con-ditions under red light. The testing device was video-recorded, and the experimenter supervised the test inan adjacent room.Videotapes were scored by a naivetrained observer by using a software developed in ourlaboratory.Behaviors were encoded afterward directlyon a PC keyboard.Data were then transferred forstatistical analysis.Activity- and anxiety-related behaviors were assessed.Standard measures comprised the total number of armentries (arm entry defined as all four paws entering anarm), the number of open- and closed-arm entries, andthe time spent in different sections of the maze (open andclosed arms and central platform).In addition to conven-tional measures, two specific behavioral measures wererecorded: rearing frequency/duration and head dippingfrequency (exploratory movement of head/shoulders overthe sides of the maze).
Eight-Arm Maze Rats were tested at 80 days of age for spatial orienta- tion, learning and memory capacities in the eight-armradial maze according to the procedure originally de-scribed by Olton and Samuelson. 27Animals were food deprived to 85% of their body weight before testing and maintained at that weight during the 5 days of testing.The apparatus was a wooden gray, enclosed eight-armradial maze with walls and entirely covered with a trans-parent top.Each of the arms (60 /H1100312/H1100317 cm) projected from one side of an octagonal central platform measuring50 cm in diameter.One food pellet (45 mg) was posi-tioned at the far end of each arm.Before each trial, everyarm of the maze was baited with a food pellet.Reinforce- ment was not replaced during the test.The whole appa-ratus was video-recorded from above under red light.Atthe beginning of the test, a white plastic cylinder (45 cmin diameter) was used to place the rats in the centralplatform.
The cylinder was taken back, and animals wereleft in the maze until they had either entered all eight armsor until 15 minutes had elapsed, whichever occurred first.Placing all four paws inside an arm was recorded as anarm entrance. Times of arm entrances, the identity ofeach arm entered, and the serial order were recorded.Allrats were tested for 5 consecutive days (one test perday).Statistical Analyses Data were prospectively collected and analyzed withStatview 5 software for Windows (SAS Institute, Berkley,CA).Reported as means /H11006SD, raw data were compared by using one-way analysis of variance with Fisher’s test.Regarding behavioral studies, the distribution of the datadeviated quite strongly from normality and varianceswere not equal.Therefore, nonparametric statistics wereused, 28and data were analyzed by /H92732test and Mann- Whitney U-test.
Univariate z-correlation analyses were used to evaluate the relationships between plasma con-centrations of vitamin B12, folate, Hcy, and the time togoal in negative geotaxis (day 8) and locomotor coordi-nation (day 21) tests as well as between body weight andscores achieved in behavioral tests. For all analyses, aPvalue /H110210.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.Results Vitamin and Hcy Concentrations In control rats, plasma concentrations of vitamin B12 and folate significantly decreased during development,whereas homocysteinemia progressively increased (Ta-ble 1).When pups were fed by dams receiving the defi-cient diet, plasma levels of vitamin B12 and folate werepersistently reduced as compared with controls, andthese observations were associated with increasing ho-mocysteinemia.
In contrast, the erythrocyte glutathionereductase activation coefficient value in rats subjected tothe deficient diet (1.1 /H110060.4) was similar to that recorded in rats subjected to a normal diet (1.1 /H110060.3), suggesting the absence of vitamin B2 deprivation. In tissue homog-enates issued from the whole brain, the deficient diet wasassociated with a significant reduction of folate concen-tration at 21 days of age, without concomitant alteration ofvitamin B12 concentration.Correlatively, brain concen-tration of Hcy was significantly augmented in deficientrats.Although not shown in Table 1, regional investiga-tions showed a substantial increase in the cerebellum(P/H110210.01), whereas changes in the hippocampus re- mained not significant ( P/H110050.069).Finally, cerebral con- centration of SAM was unaffected by the dietary condi-tions, whereas SAH concentration was significantly670 Blaise et al AJP February 2007, Vol.170, No.2 enhanced by the early exposure to deficient diet.
As a consequence, the brain SAM/SAH ratio was found to bemarkedly reduced in the deficient group (Table 1). Inparallel, substantial growth retardation was recorded inrats early exposed to the deficient diet, as previouslydocumented.16At postnatal day 21, body weight was reduced from 44.66 /H110063.13 g in controls to 17.72 /H11006 4.30 g in deficient animals ( n/H1100512,P/H110210.0001), whereas brain weight varied from 1.53 /H110060.08 g to 1.08 /H110060.03 g (n/H1100512,P/H110210.0001).Brain Accumulation of Homocysteine As illustrated in Figure 1, Hcy immunoreactivity in defi- cient pups was dramatically increased in specific brainregions corresponding to the cerebellum, the hippocam-pus, the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen), andthe subventricular zone lining the lateral ventricle.In thecerebellum, strongest staining was detected in the gran-ular cell layer.In the hippocampus, the CA1 pyramidallayer exhibited particularly high amounts of Hcy-reactivecells.
In this structure, the percentage of total cells thatwere Hcy-positive was found to increase from 3.5 /H110061.5 in controls to 32.7 /H110069.1 ( P/H110210.0001) at 21 days of age. The density of Hcy-positive cells was lower in other hip-pocampal subregions, whereas the presence of Hcy washardly detectable in the dentate gyrus and hilus.Suchobservations certainly account for the lack of significantchanges in Hcy concentration in the total hippocampus.High magnification revealed that Hcy accumulated in thecytosol and was present in cell processes (Figure 2, Aand B).
Further immunohistochemical experiments per-formed with specific cell markers in combination with Hcyantibody revealed that Hcy was present in both neuronsand astrocytes, as illustrated in Figure 2B showing thelocalization of Hcy in CA1 hippocampal cells expressingeither the neuronal protein NeuN or the glial markerGFAP.Induction of Apoptosis At 21 days of age, immunological labeling of cells exhibiting single-stranded DNA (Apostain, a specificmarker for apoptotic cells) showed a substantial in-crease (fivefold) of cells undergoing apoptosis in theCA1 hippocampal layer of rats exposed to the deficientdiet as compared with controls (Figure 2C). In parallel,the number of cells expressing the well-known apo-ptosis-related protein p53 increased in the same pro-portion (Figure 2, D and E).
Co-labeling studies al-lowed to show that a high number of cells containingHcy were positive for the specific antibody againstsingle-stranded DNA as well as for p53, suggesting theoccurrence of Hcy-associated apoptotic cell death inthe hippocampus of deficient rats. The presence of apoptosis was further documented after DAPI staining by the identification of condensedchromatin and apoptotic bodies (Figure 2F).Coupledwith immunolabeling of cell types, this procedure alsoshowed that both neurons and astrocytes underwentapoptosis, but neurons appeared more prone to celldeath (not shown).Finally, histological staining by thi-onine confirmed cell loss in rats subjected to the deficient regimen, as shown by an obvious reduction of the thick-ness of the CA1 pyramidal layer that reached 48.2%(Figure 2G).Immunostaining of GFAP or vimentin did notreveal a noticeable gliosis.
MS and CBS Analyses Because cellular Hcy can be eliminated by either MS (rem-ethylation pathway) or CBS (transsulfuration pathway),these two enzymes were analyzed at postnatal day 21 inbrain regions where Hcy was shown to accumulate as aconsequence of the deficient diet. Results are only illus-trated by studies performed in the cerebellum (Figure 3),Table 1.Effects of the Dietary Regimen on Concentrations of Homocysteine and Homocysteine Determinants in Developing Rats AgeNormal diet Deficient diet Day 2 Day 5 Day 21 Day 2 Day 5 Day 21 Plasma Hcy (/H9262mol/L)2.4/H110060.4 2.3 /H110060.3 6.8 /H110060.3†‡5.1/H110062.1 11.4 /H110060.7*†13.3/H110063.7*†‡ Plasma vitamin B12 (pmol/L)5579.0 /H110061348.3 2344.5 /H11006429.6†1202.6 /H11006161.5†‡2276.0 /H11006118.2* 1036.6 /H11006525.5*†333.6/H1100661.4*†‡ Plasma folate (nmol/L)203.0/H1100644.6 145.3 /H1100621.7†86.9/H1100615.5†‡180.2/H1100638.8 76.2 /H1100621.8*†33.1/H1100610.7*†‡ Brain Hcy (pmol/ mg protein)n.d.n.d.99.7 /H110069.8 n.d.

Enzymatic activity of MS was dra-matically altered by the nutritional conditions and varied inthe cerebellar tissue from 18.9 /H110064.3 nmol/hour/mg in con- trols to 3.3 /H110060.4 nmol/hour/mg in deficient animals ( n/H110058, P/H110210.0001). By contrast, CBS activity remained unaffected, corresponding to 10.9 /H110061.8 nmol/hour/mg in the deficient group versus 11.2 /H110061.9 nmol/hour/mg in the control group (n/H110058,P/H110050.8376) (Figure 3, left).In an attempt to test whether alterations of gene transcription might account forthe above observations, mRNA levels were also quantified.As shown in Figure 3 (right), neither the amounts of MSmRNAs nor the amounts of CBS mRNAs in the rat cerebel-lum seemed to be modified by the early exposure to thedeficient diet.Indeed, no significant differences could befound in MS/L27 ratio values between the two experimentalgroups, and the same conclusion can be drawn about CBS/L27 ratios.
Neurobehavioral Development Righting Reflex, Negative Geotaxis, and Suspension Time No statistically significant difference was found be- tween the two experimental groups (ie, normal diet anddeficient diet) in the percentage of animals that wereable to achieve the tests evaluating righting reflex(postnatal days 3 to 5) and negative geotaxis (postna-tal days 8 to 10) (Figure 4, A and B).

Regarding suspension time at postnatal day 10, the mediantime during which rat pups were able to grasp the metal rodbefore falling was similar in the two experimental groups(Figure 4C). Locomotor Coordination As a whole, there was a statistically significant differ- ence between the two animal groups in the global rates ofsuccess for the full test of locomotor coordinationthroughout the 3 days during which the experiment wasrepeated (Figure 5, top).On the 3rd day, all control animals were successful in achieving the task, whereas37% of rats early exposed to the deficient diet wereunable to perform the test.In addition, the time necessaryto perform the whole part of the test was persistentlylonger in deficient rats.According to our data, the swim-ming phase mainly accounted for the globally poorerperformances recorded in deficient pups (Figure 5).
In-deed, the success score was substantially reduced indeficient rats, and the time spent to swim and to find thepole inside the water was systematically longer for defi-cient animals than for their control congeners. In allcases, differences between controls and deficient pupsremained significant after correction of the data for bodyweight.Correlation Studies Plasma concentrations of Hcy were significantly corre- lated to concentrations of folate ( P/H110210.0001) and vitamin B12 ( P/H110210.0001) in 21-day-old rats.At this stage, brain weight was significantly correlated to plasma concentra-tions of folate ( P/H110210.0001), vitamin B12 ( P/H110210.0001), and Hcy ( P/H110210.0001).
At the functional level, the time to goal in negative geotaxis at postnatal day 8 was signifi-cantly correlated to plasma concentrations of folate ( P/H11005 0.0455), vitamin B12 ( P/H110050.0078), and Hcy ( P/H110050.0002), whereas the time to achieve the full test of locomotorcoordination at postnatal day 21 was correlated toplasma concentrations of vitamin B12 ( P/H110050.0097) and Hcy ( P/H110210.0001). Consequences of Dietary Reversal at Weaning After weaning, rat pups that received the deficient regi- men in utero and then through their mothers’ milk were then fed with standard food until postnatal day 80.Toevaluate the long-term effects of the dietary reversal andto compare with control rats that received standard dietduring the whole period, various parameters that are inline with Hcy metabolism were monitored again at 80days of age.Table 2 shows that all factors studied Figure 3.

In particular,plasma and brain concentrations of Hcy were similar inthe two experimental groups. Only plasma levels of folate were slightly more elevated in the previously deficientgroup compared with controls ( P/H110050.0413).It is note- worthy, however, that body weight and brain weight re-mained significantly altered at postnatal day 80.Indeed,the recorded mean body weight was 306.60 /H1100613.52 g versus 373.80 /H1100622.08 g in controls ( n/H1100512,P/H110050.0004), and mean brain weight was found to be 1.81 /H110060.93 g versus 2.07 /H110060.13 g ( n/H1100512,P/H110050.0076).Moreover, thionine staining depicted long-lasting histological defi-cits in the CA1 hippocampus (Figure 6), whereas nopatent morphological alterations could be seen in otherbrain regions, at least with the methods used.Exploratory Behavior in the Elevated-Plus Maze The number of total arm entries as well as the percent- age of entries in open arms was similar in the two exper-imental groups (Table 3).
In addition, the time spent inopen arms and in protected areas (which include closedarms and the central platform) did not differ betweenpreviously deficient rats and controls. The number ofrearings and rearing duration were significantly lower inthe deficient group ( P/H110050.043 and P/H110050.012, respec- tively).More specifically, rearing duration was reducedboth on open arms ( P/H110050.039) and in protected areas (P/H110050.022), and it is noteworthy that rearings occurred more frequently in protected areas ( P/H110050.009) and less frequently in open arms ( P/H110050.009).Finally, head dip- ping over the sides of the maze, another aspect of verti-cal exploratory behavior, was also altered in the deficientgroup, its frequency being significantly reduced in open Figure 5.Effects of the dietary regimen on locomotor coordination evaluated at 19 to 21 days of age ( n/H1100535 per group).

For the latter two parameters, thescore was significantly different between the two exper-imental groups during sessions two and three, inasmuchas the total number of arms visited and the number oferrors during these two sessions were inferior in deficientanimals. Finally, the total number of arms entered perminute was lower in the deficient group than in the controlgroup during sessions two, four, and five, suggesting areduced locomotor activity (Figure 7D).Discussion In line with elevated homocysteinemia, reduced intake ofvitamins B, mainly folate and vitamin B12, has been im-plicated in several neurological and psychological disor-ders.Hcy has been associated with cognitive dysfunc-tions in Down syndrome and in the elderly, and it hasbeen identified as a predictor of Alzheimer’s dis-ease.
3,5,29–32Our study showed that gestational vitamin B deficiency leads to accumulation of Hcy with concom- itant apoptosis in selective brain areas and persistentlyalters neurobehavioral capacities in developing rats. Physiologically, a progressive increase in Hcy plasma concentration was documented between birth and wean-ing in control animals.As previously reported, this obser-vation can be attributed to developmental changes in theactivities of hepatic enzymes involved in Hcy metabo-lism.33At each developmental stage studied, the defi - cient diet resulted in a significant reduction of plasmaconcentrations in vitamin B12 and folate, with no biolog-ical evidence of vitamin B2 depletion, considering theerythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficientvalues.As a consequence, homocysteinemia was mark-edly augmented to reach values corresponding to clini-cally recognized moderate hyperhomocysteinemia inhumans.
16 In the brain tissue, early exposure to the deprived regimen was associated at 21 days of age with a lowerTable 3.

Protected areas include closed arms and the central platform.Figure 7.Effect of early exposure to the deficient diet followed by dietary reversal to normal food at weaning on the rat behavior in the eight-arm mazeat postnatal day 80.Data represent median values from 14 control rats and 22rats previously exposed to deficient diet.Statistically significant differencebetween the two experimental groups: * P/H110210.05 (Mann-Whitney U-test).676 Blaise et al AJP February 2007, Vol.170, No.2 folate concentration without concomitant alteration of vi- tamin B12 concentration, probably reflecting a sparingprocess.As expected, deficient rats displayed a notice-able brain accumulation of Hcy.In parallel, brain concen-tration of SAH was substantially elevated, whereas SAMconcentration remained unaffected.
This may be attribut-able to the reversed activity of the bi-directional enzymeSAH hydrolase in response to increased Hcy levels. Be-cause SAH is itself a potent competitive inhibitor of SAM-mediated methylation reactions, the resulting fall of theSAM/SAH ratio can therefore affect DNA methylation andthus alter gene expression, as previously shown in rathepatocytes.34Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Hcy was not distributed uniformly in the brain but accumulated in specific regions, including the cerebel-lum (predominantly in the granular cell layer), the hip-pocampus (mostly in the CA1 pyramidal layer), the stria-tum (in the caudate-putamen), and the subventricularzone lining the lateral ventricle.These observations are ingood accordance with a pioneering study by Chung andcolleagues 35using transgenic mice expressing a human Cu/Zn SOD mutation that reported high amounts of Hcy in the hippocampal CA1 layer and in cerebellar nuclei.
Like-wise, Hcy was found to accumulate in the same brainareas in CBS /H11002//H11002mice, another model of hyperhomocys - teinemia, in which the authors also reported the presenceof Hcy in Purkinje cells and basket cells in cerebellum. 36 In addition, we showed the presence of Hcy in the sub-ventricular zone, which is known as a neurogenic site inthe adult mammalian brain.37This observation is of inter - est regarding the brain capacity to generate new cellsinasmuch as it was recently reported that folate defi-ciency can inhibit proliferation of progenitors in the adultmouse brain.38Regional examination of two key enzymes involved in Hcy metabolism, ie, MS and CBS, revealed that the transsulfuration pathway, reflected by CBS activ-ity, was not affected in the brain of deficient rats, bycontrast to the severe alteration previously observed inthe liver.
16Conversely, MS activity was dramatically re - duced in deficient pups as compared with controls (eg, itwas approximately sixfold less active in the cerebellartissue of deficient rats than in controls), suggesting thatthe remethylation pathway may play a critical role in brainaccumulation of Hcy in our model. According to our data,alteration of MS activities observed in the deficient groupcannot be explained by changes in gene transcription.Reduced availability of folate, a co-substrate for MS, andpossibly of circulating vitamin B12 probably account forthe decrease in enzyme activity.Furthermore, it has beenreported that MS activity is mainly regulated at the post-transcriptional level.39,40 Co-labeling studies showed that Hcy was present in both neuronal cells and astrocytes of deficient rats.In-deed, Hcy-positive cells expressed either NeuN or GFAPthat are specific markers for neurons and astrocytes,respectively.
Both types of neural cells have been re-ported to potentially accumulate Hcy. 15,41,42Until very recently, it was considered that only neurons, but not astrocytes, possessed sufficient amounts of the enzymeCBS to catabolize Hcy, 43and it was suggested that as - trocytes need to export Hcy to neurons to keep low levelsof the amino acid, while they take up cysteine.44Accord - ing to Benz and colleagues,45such a process could influence the functional crosstalk between neurons and astrocytes.It must be noticed, however, that it has beennewly demonstrated that CBS is significantly expressedin astrocytes throughout the mouse brain.46In the hip - pocampus of deficient rats, apoptosis was found in cellscontaining Hcy, in line with an increased expression ofp53, one major step through which Hcy has been shownto promote apoptotic cell death.
3Hcy-induced neurotox - icity is known to also include DNA damage and alteredDNA repair attributable to disturbance in the DNA meth-ylation cycle, glutamate excitotoxicity via stimulation ofN-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, calcium overload, and oxidativestress. 3,47 Clinically, it is known that elevated levels of Hcy are linked to neurological impairments and cognitive de-cline.3,6,48Accordingly, the present study reports that neurobehavioral development was altered in hyperhomo- cysteinemic rats.Data recorded in early tests (ie, rightingreflex and negative geotaxis) certainly reflect delayedbrain maturation, 49whereas the lack of difference in the suspension time between the two experimental groups is in favor of the absence of muscular weakness in deficientrats, in agreement with their harmonious growth retarda-tion, as previously documented.
16At 19 to 21 days of age, global scores for achieving the test of locomotor coordination were significantly reduced after early expo-sure to the deficient regimen. Both the success scoresand the time necessary to perform the tasks were af-fected in deficient rats, indicating poorer locomotor ca-pacities.There were no correlations between bodyweight and behavioral scores.It can be hypothesizedthat the accumulation of Hcy recorded in motor areassuch as the cerebellum and the striatum may account, atleast partly, for these observations.It has been recentlyshown that experimentally induced increase of Hcyamounts in striatal regions decreased dopamine concen-trations and reduced locomotor activity in mice andrats.50 To our knowledge, no study has investigated the po- tential reversibility of hyperhomocysteinemia effects in anutritional animal model.When deficient pups were fedwith standard food after weaning, homocysteinemia re-turned to normal values.
Brain levels of folate, Hcy, aswell as MS enzymatic activity were no longer differentfrom controls. In the elevated plus-maze, global explora-tion of open and closed arms was similar in the twoexperimental groups.Nevertheless, detailed analysis re-vealed that the previously deficient group exhibited areduced vertical exploratory behavior as compared withcontrols.This was reflected by significant decreases inthe total number and duration of rearings.In addition,both rearing and head-dipping frequencies were signifi-cantly reduced in open arms and augmented in secureareas.According to several authors, 51–53such postural elements in the elevated plus-maze would be indicative of risk assessment, and our observations may reflectlower propensity to take risks rather than anxiety itself.This is in good agreement with behavioral scores re-Effects of Early Vitamin B Deficiency 677 AJP February 2007, Vol.170, No.
2 corded in the eight-arm maze where previously deficient rats, by contrast to controls, needed a rather constanttime throughout the five sessions to visit all arms, sug-gesting impaired spatial memory. Nonetheless, suchslowness was associated with a lower number of errorscompared with controls as soon as the second day oftesting.It can therefore be speculated that rats of thedeficient group are more circumspect before entering anarm, need more time for risk assessment and decisionmaking, to finally commit fewer errors than controls.Thehippocampus has been reported to be prominently in-volved in spatial working memory, and the integrity ofCA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, including their inter-connections, is known to be of critical importance inlearning and retrieval of spatial memory, 54suggesting that the observed Hcy-associated cell apoptosis may have directly, and durably, affected the capacities ofdeficient rats.
In addition, Hcy is known to act on gluta-matergic NMDA and metabotropic receptors that arecrucial for spatial learning and neuronal plasticity. 55 In conclusion, the present study provides new insights to the brain response to early deprivation in methyl do-nors and thus to the resulting shortage of Hcy metabo-lism.The data suggest the occurrence of long-term func-tional disabilities, even in case of subsequent dietarynormalization.
Although a direct effect of folate and vita-min B12 deficiency cannot be excluded, for example viaSAM depletion, which can result in decreased DNA meth-ylation and enhanced DNA damage, or via increasedsynthesis of tumor necrosis factor- /H9251related to vitamin B12 deprivation,3,56,57our observations may reflect that Hcy-mediated apoptotic cell death in sensitive brain ar- eas involved in motor functions (striatum, cerebellum) orin learning and memory (hippocampus), whereas thegeneration of new neural cells might additionally be com-promised by the dietary conditions. Therefore, authoritiesshould be aware of the potential risk incurred by infantsfrom women exposed during their pregnancies to a di-etary regimen deprived in methyl donors, especially fo-late and vitamin B12.Acknowledgment We thank Sandra Audonnet-Blaise for assistance.References 1.Finkelstein JD: The metabolism of homocysteine: pathways and reg- ulation.Eur J Pediatr 1998, 157(Suppl 2):S40–S44 2.
