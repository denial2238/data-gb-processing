Research has demonstrated that BCAAsincrease mTOR phosphorylation and activate p70 S6kinase in human muscle via an Akt-independent pathway.The extent to which BCAAs influence the anabolic hor-mone response in conjunction with resistance exercise isnot well established. A randomized, double-blind, pla- cebo-controlled study was performed to evaluate the effects of BCAA ingestion in conjunction with an acutebout of lower-body resistance exercise (RE) on variousanabolic hormones.Methods 20 recreationally active males ingested a BCAA supple-ment (120 mg/kg/bw) (n = 10; 24.4 years; 178.3 cm; 85.4kg) or a placebo (n = 10; 21 years; 176.8 cm; 83 kg) at 3time points: 30 minutes prior to RE, and immediately pre-RE and immediately post-RE.Subjects performed 4 sets ofleg press and 4 sets of leg extension at 80% 1 RM to failure.Rest periods between sets and exercises was approximately 150 seconds.
Venous blood was sampled at baseline; 30min later, immediate postexercise, 30 min post-exercise; 2hrs post-exercise, and 6 hrs post-exercise for serum insu-lin, growth hormone (GH), and free insulin-like growthfactor-1 (IGF-1). A two-way ANOVA with repeated meas-ures was utilized to analyze the data.Results Data are reported as means ± SD at baseline; 30 min later, immediate postexercise, 30 min post-exercise; 2 hrs post- exercise, and 6 hrs post-exercise.Insulin values were 19.2± 7.8, 23.0 ± 9.6, 25.3 ± 12.9, 24.8 ± 14.3, 19.0 ± 9.0, 15.8± 6.4 and 22.0 ± 10.5, 22.0 ± 10.9, 27.8 ± 9, 24.1 ± 8.7,17.9 ± 8.8, 21.2 ± 12.8 uIU/mL for the BCAA and Placebogroups, respectively.A significant main effect for time wasobserved (p < .001), but no significant main effect for group (p = .758) or significant interaction (p = .465) was observed for insulin.
GH values were .41 ± .81, .64 ± .97,1.9 ± 2.2, 1.5 ± 2.6, .23 ± .32, 2.6 ± 4.0 and .07 ± .09, .84± 1.3, 2.2 ± 1.9, 2.2 ± 3.8, .28 ± .76, .36 ± .56 ng/ml for theBCAA and Placebo groups, respectively. A significantmain effect for time was observed (p = .021), but no sig- nificant main effect for group (p = .672) or significant interaction (p = .217) was observed for GH.Free IGF-1values were 1.3 ± .83, 1.2 ± .72, 1.2 ± .77, 1.4 ± .91, 1.1 ±.74, .95 ± .64 and 1.3 ± .43, 1.2 ± .43, 1.6 ± .54, 1.5 ± .57,1.4 ± .46, 1.1 ± .53 ng/ml for the BCAA and Placebogroups, respectively.A significant main effect for time was observed (p = .014), but no significant main effect for group (p = .569) or significant interaction (p = .356) wasobserved for free IGF-1.Conclusion An acute bout of lower-body RE significantly increasesinsulin, GH, and IGF-1 in the immediate post-exercisefrom 2009 International Society of Sports Nutrition Conference and Expo New Orleans, LA, USA.
