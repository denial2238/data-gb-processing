However, there is a lack of data regarding ef-fects of Withania somnifera on the steroidogenic pathways. Steroidogenesis impacts not only sexual differentiation, re- production, and fertility but also other physiological proc- esses, including hypertension and obesity.Moreover, themodulation of hormone signaling is an important targetin hormone-responsive pathogenesis, and overproductionof androgens has been implicated in the pathogenesis ofprostate cancer (PCa) and polycystic ovarian syndrome(PCOS).In humans, testosterone is mainly produced inthe testes after conversion of pregnenolone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone (17-OHPreg) and dehydroepian- drosterone (DHEA, the precursor of androgens) by adrenal CYP17A1, which catalyzes both the 17-hydroxylation ofsteroids for cortisol production and the breakage of 17,20bonds (17,20 lyase) in 17-OHPreg to produce DHEA.
The in-take of substances that may increase androgen levels bypeople with PCa or PCOS or with predisposition to theseconditions may trigger pathogenesis or worsen prognosisby accelerating disease progression. We investigated the ef-fects of Withania somnifera in modulating the adrenal ster- oidogenic pathway and the possible consequences on thepathogenesis of androgen-responsive conditions, speci ﬁcal- ly PCa.Adrenal cells were treated with the extract ofWithania somnifera to characterize its effect on adrenal steroid pro ﬁle and CYP17A1 hydroxylase and lyase activ- ities.Prostate cancer proliferation was assessed by directincubation of prostate cancer cells with extracts as well aswith conditioned media from adrenal cells treated for 48h,to simulate natural steroidogenesis.
The results suggestthat adrenal steroid hormone biosynthesis can be alteredby the intake of Withania somnifera extract and that this supplement may affect proliferation of PCa cells.Moreover, the reported testosterone booster effect ofWithania somnifera supplementation does not appear to be through increased adrenal androgen production.
