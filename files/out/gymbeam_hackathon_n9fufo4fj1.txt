Editorial Danish banonAshwagandha: Truth, evidence, ethics, andregulations “Therearetwowaystobedeceived:oneconsistsinbelievinginwhatisnot true,andtheotherinrefusingtobelievewhatistrue.”-SørenKierke- gaard,Danishphilosopher ThebanonAshwagandha byDenmark invites scientific scrutiny as thisdecision may have farreaching consequences.Therefore, asasci- entific journal, itisourduty totakeitsduecognizance.Ashwagandha, botanically classified asWithaniasomnifera (L.) Dunal, Family Solanaceae, isalsoknown asIndian ginseng orwinter cherry.Ashwagandha roots have been used forcenturies inAsian cul- tures andIndian traditional medicine systems, including Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, andSowa Rigpa.Itiswidely known foritshealth benefits andhasattracted more attention during COVID-19 pandemic.Itis readily available asadietary supplement inmany countries.
Itis recognized inseveral pharmacopoeia andauthoritative compendiums worldwide, such astheAyurvedic Pharmacopoeia ofIndia, Indian Pharmacopoeia, British Pharmacopoeia, European Pharmacopoeia, United States Pharmacopoeia, American Herbal Pharmacopoeia, Japa- nese Pharmacopoeia, Pharmacopoeia ofthePeople ’sRepublic ofChina, andtheWorld Health Organization ’sMonographs. Despite itswide- spread global recognition, theDanish Veterinary andFood Adminis- tration (DVFA) decided tobanAshwagandha based ona2020 report by theTechnology University ofDenmark (DTU).1.Concerns withtheDTUreport TheDTU report hasseveral technical, scientific, andethical pitfalls.This report does notseem tobepeer-reviewed, thecredentials ofthe authors, funding sources, andconflict ofinterests arenotdisclosed.The English version oftheDTU report isabitunusual.Thereasoning is hardly convincing, infact,itcontradicts itself atseveral points.
TheDTU report onAshwagandha discusses itsingredients, general toxicity, ef- fects onsexhormones andreproduction, metabolism, immune system, andcentral nervous system. Unfortunately, thereport refers toafew articles from predatory journals initssketchy literature review.Although themandate from DVFA isonAshwagandha roots, itdraws conclusions from studies onwhole plants, stems, leaves, fruits/berries clearly irrelevant tothiscase.Generally, theDTU report isfarfrom a critical review oranalysis and inconsistent with themethodology commonly practiced infood andpharmaceutical sciences making it substandard andmisleading.Itisnotclear what prompted theDVFA tocommission thisreport to theDTU.Thereport lacks systematic evidence synthesis tosupport the decision tobanAshwagandha.
Some oftheserious gaps inDTU report have been critically discussed inthecontext ofchemistry andbiologicaleffects ofAshwagandha [1].Generally, theconclusions drawn bythe DTU report arefarfrom truth, rather closer todeception. TheDTU report hasnotconsidered several clinical studies including those demonstrating female fertility promotion and theabsence of mutagenecity orgenotoxicity [2].A2018 systematic review hasre- ported thatAshwagandha roots enhance spermatogenesis andimprove sperm-related indices [3].TheDTU report cites anethnobotanical sur- veyandpre-clinical animal studies toclaim abortifacient effects in humans [4].However, theethnobotanical survey hasbeen challenged anddisproved bysubsequent research reporting noevidence ofmaternal orfetal toxicity even from high doses ofAshwagandha rootextract [5].Also, traditional use,clinical studies, andpharmacovigilance datadonot support these claims regarding abortifacient effects.
Agreeably, afew sporadic reports have raised concerns about possible adverse events related toliver, thyroid, and gastrointestinal system. However, no conclusive causal relation with Ashwagandha hasbeen established [6, 7].Inaddition, several studies have reported noobserved adverse effect level (NOAEL) forAshwagandha roots even athigh doses.Ashwagandha istraditionally used only asrootpowder 3–5gmperdayorequivalent aqueous orhydro-ethanolic extracts.Despite numerous studies showing feto-maternal safety ofAshwagandha root, itisnotknown whytheDTU report hascited poorly conducted studies, thattooonmethanol and other solvent extracts, andignored scholarly scientific literature.Claims regarding hormonal, reproductive, immunological, andneurological risks pointed outintheDTU report aresimilarly flawed.
2.DVFA ’sbanonAshwagandha TheDVFA ’sofficial website states: “DonoteatAshwagandha or supplements containing Ashwagandha because itsroot hasnegative effects onsexhormones andreproduction forboth men andwomen. In addition, theplant canaffect themetabolism, theimmune system, and thecentral nervous system.”Having researched andused Ashwagandha forover three decades, wefindthatthestatement isfarfrom truth.TheDTU report fails onscientific andethical aspects.Regulatory agencies, especially inthefood and drug domains, typically have stringent procedures forapproving substances/products forhealth benefits.TheDVFA should have followed asimilar stringent procedure forbanning Ashwagandha.However, thisisnotthecase.3.Flawedreport,flaweddecisions Theprimary reference fortheDTU report ’sconclusion regarding abortifacient effects isthe World Health Organization ’s(WHO) Peer review under responsibility ofTransdisciplinary University, Bangalore.

Published by Elsevier B.V.on behalf of Institute of Transdisciplinary Health Sciences and Technology and World Ayurveda Foundation This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).Monograph onSelected Medicinal Plants onAshwagandha (2009) that inturn refers totheAmerican Herbal Pharmacopoeia (AHP) Ashwa- gandha Root Monograph andTherapeutic Compendium (2000).How- ever, thisreference chain perpetuates citation distortion.Thereport does notcorrectly interpret theAHP monograph inclaiming abortifa- cient effect; rather, themonograph highlights Ashwagandha’s tradi- tional usetoprevent miscarriage andstabilize pregnancies.
TheAHP editor hasissued aclarification thatdefeats theDTU report’s foundation [8]. The American Herbal Products Association’s Botanical Safety Handbook (BSH) affirmed thereproductive safety ofAshwagandha in 2022 andreclassified itssafety Class from 2dto1based onnewstudies.BSH Class 1signifies thataplant isconsidered safewhen used appro- priately.Itisgenerally well-tolerated andsuitable foruseinherbal products orremedies.TheDTU report anditsfindings arecontradictory tothescientific literature thathasemerged over thepastfewdecades.PubMed search forAshwagandha yields over 1100 papers published during 2013–2024 (asonJune 2024), which indicates growing interest inAshwagandha anditshealth andwell-being potential.Itmust benoted thatnoclinical trials inthelasttenyears have reported anyserious adverse events associated with Ashwagandha roots.More than 500scientific papers have been published onthesafety andactivity ofAshwagandha since the DTU report of2020.
This new body ofevidence shows thattheDTU report isredundant, irrational andcalls foritsupdate. 4.International perspectives Outlooks onsafety anduseofAshwagandha vary globally.For instance, Ashwagandha rootuseispermitted asafood ordietary sup- plement intheUnited States ofAmerica andtheUnited Kingdom.The American National Center forComplementary andIntegrative Health of theNational Institutes ofHealth informs ofthesafety ofAshwagandha forshort-term use.TheMedicines andHealthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) oftheUKhaspermitted theongoing APRIL Trial which isarandomized, placebo-controlled trial using Ashwagandha ledby researchers attheLondon School ofHygiene &Tropical Medicine, UK, andtheAllIndia Institute ofAyurveda, India.About 320medicines listed intheAustralian Register ofTherapeutic Goods (ARTG) include Ashwagandha.Several European andScandinavian countries also have taken a balanced approach.Forinstance, Poland allows theuseofAshwagandha roots butnotleaves orother parts.
Itfurther specifies thatthecontent of withanoloids should belessthan 10mg inthedaily portion ofthe product. Germany hasexpressed concerns about Ashwagandha probably based ontheDTU report; however, itcontinues tobeavailable there.Sweden permits local authorities totake decisions onsuch matters rather than depriving people ofitshealth benefits.These decisions are rational, scientific, andinthepublic interest.However, Denmark seems tohave overlooked these facts.Weareafraid thattheDTU report might influence thedecisions of some countries inthisregard.Itisnecessary toundertake asystematic situation analysis onthestatus ofAshwagandha indifferent countries.In thiscontext, theMinistry ofAYUSH, Government ofIndia hasreleased a Ashwagandha Safety Dossier 2024.This dossier synthesizes data and presents robust scientific evidence onsafety andefficacy ofAshwa- gandha roots.
5.Risk-benefit analysis TheDTU report istitled "Risk assessment oftheroot ofWithania somnifera." A′riskassessment’ approach istypically used forenviron- mental oroccupational hazards, whereas forpharmacological purposes, a’safety assessment’ thatincludes toxicity and‘risk-benefit analysis’ are more appropriate. Ashwagandha isknown asRasayana, which means beneficial for rejuvenation, immunomodulation, and longevity.Substantial scientific evidence supports thebenefits ofAshwagandha in inflammation, stress, cancer, neurodegeneration, musculoskeletal dis- eases, andhealthy aging [9,10].TheDTU report entirely ignores the’benefit’ component, raising serious questions about itsconclusions.Most drugs have some adverse effects butareused based onrisk-benefit assessments.Forexample, toxic drugs likeTaxol areused incancer treatment because their benefits outweigh therisks.
Proper health advice along with essential informa- tion consisting precautions, contraindications, anddosage ofAshwa- gandha will help maximize itstherapeutic benefits. Banning Ashwagandha roots based onthedataonthetoxicity ofleaves orberries isakintobanning apples because their seeds contain amygdalin which is aprecursor tocyanide.6.Responsible regulatory mechanisms There isnodenying thatregulators must becareful about thesafety andquality ofanyproduct forhuman consumption.However, forthis purpose, robust mechanisms arenecessary.Decision-making must be based onscientific evidence andnotinfluenced bypolitical, economic, orother factors.TheDVFA isaresponsible regulatory agency from a progressive country like Denmark.The DVFA decision could have cascading consequences, potentially extending beyond theambit of science andregulation intogeopolitics oreconomics.ThecaseofthebanonAshwagandha underscores theimportance of transparency inevidence-based regulations.
Aprestigious institution likeDTU should have exercised greater caution inpreparing thisreport, given itspotential impact onpublic health. TheDVFA should reconsider thebaninthelight oftheextensive scientific literature supporting safety andefficacy ofAshwagandha roots.Thisincidence invokes thevalue of truth inKierkegaardian words ofwisdom!India’s richheritage oftraditional medicine offers thepotential for planetary well-being inthespirit ofVasudhaiva Kutumbakam, theworld asonefamily.Scientific exploration, guided byethics andinternational collaboration, should serve ahigher purpose –aworld where ad- vancements promote solidarity, andharmony.AstheVedas teach us, ‘SarveSantuNiramaya -SarveBhavantuSukhinah’ –leteveryone befree from illness andfindpeace andhappiness.This isthetruepurpose of science.Scientific community shall collaborate forthepursuit ofa healthier, andhappier world.Funding sources Nofunding wasreceived forthiswork.
