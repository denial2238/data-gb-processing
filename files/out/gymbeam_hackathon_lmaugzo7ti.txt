Atherosclerosis, the primary underlying cause of CVD, can be controlled by pharmacological and dietary interventions, including n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation.
n-3 PUFA supplementation, primarily consisting of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), has shown promise in reducing atherosclerosis by modulat- ing risk factors, including triglyceride levels and vascular inﬂammation. n-3 PUFAs act by replacing pro-inﬂammatory fatty acid types in cell membranes and plasma lipids, by regulating transcription factor activity, and by inducing epigenetic changes.EPA and DHA regulate cellular function through shared and differential molecular mechanisms.Large clinical studies on n-3 PUFAs have reported conﬂicting ﬁndings, causing confusion among the public and health professionals.In this review, we discuss important factors leading to these inconsistencies, in the context of atherosclerosis, including clinical study design and the differential effects of EPA and DHA on cell function.We propose steps to improve clinical and basic experimental study design in order to improve supplement composition optimization.
Finally, we propose that understanding the factors underlying the poor response to n-3 PUFAs, and the development of molecular biomarkers for predicting response may help towards a more personalized treatment.

Myocardial infarction, caused by myocardial ischemia, involves myocardial necrosis, as well as other cell death-activating pathways due to oxygen deprivation [ 3]. The main pathological cause of myocardial infarctions is associated with coronary artery disease, which involves coronary artery blockage due to accumulation of atherosclerotic plagues [ 4].Myocardial damage can eventually lead to heart failure, which involves anatomical and functional myocardial abnormalities that limit ventricular ﬁlling or blood ejection, and results in failure to satisfy the underlying needs of circulation [ 5].Ischemic stroke involves a reduction in the blood ﬂow to part or all of the brain, leading to tissue damage and Nutrients 2023 ,15, 4830.https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15224830 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients Nutrients 2023 ,15, 4830 2 of 19 some degree of neurological damage.
The major cause of ischemic stroke is the rupture of atherosclerotic plagues and the formation of thrombosis in the carotid artery [6]. 1.2.Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is primarily a lipid-driven process caused by accumulation of low- density lipoprotein (LDL) and remnant lipoprotein particles in focal areas of arteries, and an associated inﬂammatory process particularly at regions of disturbed non-laminar ﬂow at artery branch-points.The deﬁned most frequent risk factors are: high LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, age, and family history.Sedentary lifestyle, obesity, diets high in saturated and trans fats, and speciﬁc genetic abnormalities may also increase the risk [7–9].Atherosclerosis primarily develops due to trapping of lipids in the intima by the extracellular matrix, causing a modiﬁcation that drives chronic inﬂammation at vulnerable sites in the arteries.
This process, which is involved in all stages of atherogenic progres- sion, starts with nascent fatty streaks in the artery intima, which develop into ﬁbrous plaques and then into rupture-prone atherosclerotic lesions [ 10,11]. At the molecular level, LDL in the intima becomes oxidized and drives pro-inﬂammatory processes that attract monocytes to the artery wall, where they differentiate into macrophages.Macrophages take-up lipoproteins using LDL scavenging receptors, forming foam cells that create the atherosclerotic lesion.Inﬂammatory mediators also recruit vascular smooth muscle cells, which produce extracellular matrix proteins creating a ﬁbrous cap that overlies the lesion, forming an atherosclerotic plague [ 12].Reduced synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins by smooth muscle cells, and increased production of matrix metalloproteases by foam cells may lead to ﬁbrous cap thinning and plague rupture leading to thrombosis [ 13–15].
In advanced plagues, there is increased smooth muscle cell and macrophage cell death, through apoptosis or necroptosis [ 16,17]. Failure of macrophages to clear apoptotic and necrotic cells by efferocytosis, leads to the formation of the necrotic core that precipitates inﬂammation and ﬁbrous cap thinning [12,18].Treatment for coronary atherosclerosis involves measures to encourage regression and stop the growth and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques.Treating risk factors such as elevated LDL-C, high blood pressure, and diabetes, through diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and pharmacological management are the key strategies for controlling atherosclerosis [ 19–21].Statins are the mainstay for lowering LDL-C and preventing cardiovascular events and mortality.Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and vasodilators are also used for blood pressure management [22–24].1.3.
Dietary Management of Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis can be controlled by a healthy diet that is rich in ﬁbre, monounsat- urated fats, oily ﬁsh, fruits, and vegetables, and low in saturated and trans fats [ 25].n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have received considerable attention for their potential in modulating key risk factors of CVD, including triglyceride levels, lipoprotein oxidation, vascular inﬂammation and thrombogenesis. Nonetheless, clinical studies investigating the effects of n-3-PUFAs on cardiovascular health show conﬂicting ﬁndings [ 26].A bet- ter understanding of the factors underlying the variability in the effects of n-3-PUFAs in clinical studies will allow us to tailor supplementation regimes in order to achieve greater beneﬁt for the patients.In this review, we will discuss possible causes of the reported variability, by focusing on atherosclerosis.
Furthermore, we provide suggestions for im- proving pre-clinical and clinical studies in order to better understand and optimize n-3 PUFA supplementation for preventing CVD. Nutrients 2023 ,15, 4830 3 of 19 2.Current Status of Knowledge 2.1.Biochemistry and Structural Morphology of n-3 PUFAs n-3 (omega-3) PUFAs are a family of long chain cis polyunsaturated fatty acids [ 27].The term n-3 reﬂects the fact that the ﬁrst double bond is situated three carbon atoms from the methyl terminal group [ 27].Alpha linolenic acid (ALA; C18:3) is precursor to the longer chain (LC) n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6) [ 28].ALA is ‘essential’ and must be included in our diet since it cannot be synthesised de novo in the body.Oily ﬁsh are the main source of LC n-3 PUFAs [ 29].n-6 (omega-6) FAs are the second known important family of PUFAs.Linoleic acid (LA; C18:2) is a precursor to the LC n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (C20:4).
The main sources of n-6 PUFAs include the common vegetable oils used in cooking, such as sunﬂower and soybean oil, as well as foods derived from livestock animals and poultry [30]. It has been widely accepted that the present Western diet is ‘deﬁcient’ in n-3 PUFAs with a ratio of n-6 to n-3 of 15-20:1, which is far higher than the optimal 4:1 ratio and the ideal 1:1 ratio [ 31].However, reducing n-6 PUFA intake is not a prerequisite to achieve the optimum ratio.According to Zhao et al., n-6 PUFA intake can be increased without inducing any adverse effect provided that adequate n-3 PUFAs are consumed.Moreover, sufﬁcient consumption of n-6 PUFAs is important for reducing LDL-C concentrations and therefore, a sufﬁcient intake of both n-3 and n-6 PUFAs is crucial for CVD risk reduction [ 32].2.2.Clinical Evidence on the Effects of n-3 PUFAs on Different CVDs Epidemiological studies have shown a positive correlation between oily ﬁsh intake and beneﬁcial cardiovascular effects [ 33].
The evidence of the beneﬁts of oily ﬁsh is stronger in secondary than in primary prevention settings [ 34]. For instance, GISSI Prevenzione investigators (1999) showed that dietary supplementation with LC n-3 PUFAs (1 g/day) in patients after myocardial infarction reduced total mortality by 21% and sudden death by 45%.In addition, a recent pooled analysis of four cohort studies showed an association between oily ﬁsh intake and lower risk of mortality among patients with prior CVD [ 35].These beneﬁts have been attributed to the LC n-3 PUFAs, EPA and DHA, primarily found in oily ﬁsh [ 36].ALA is generally far less effective at inducing biological effects, partly because of its inefﬁcient conversion (<5%) to EPA and DHA in humans [ 28].ALA is inefﬁciently converted into the LC n-3 PUFAs partly because of the large and increasing amounts of n-6 fatty acids present in our diet, which compete for the same enzymes, shown in the metabolic pathway [37,38] (Figure 1).
The beneﬁcial effect of the LC n-3 PUFAs on reducing the risk of cardiac mortality appears to be due to their incorporation into cardiomyocyte phospholipids at the ex- pense of arachidonic acid [ 39,40]. The presence of n-3 PUFAs, particularly EPA, in the cell membranes can lead to the generation of different eicosanoids which can be more cardio- protective than those resulting from the arachidonic acid cascade [ 41–43].Several potential mechanisms for the cardioprotective effect of omega-3 fatty acids have been proposed with the effect on blood lipids, such as triglycerides (TG), LDL, and HDL, associated with risk of atherosclerosis, being the most scientiﬁcally proven [ 44,45].Particularly, the most consistent effect of n-3 PUFAs is the reduction in serum TG [46].There is a substantial confusion among the public and health professionals regarding the overall effects of n-3 PUFAs on blood lipids [ 47].
It has been suggested that elevated TG levels are independent risk factors for the progression of CVD [ 48]. In addition, smaller diameter LDL and HDL particles have been associated with increased risk [ 49,50].The ‘Omega-3 index’ [ 51], which describes the content of EPA and DHA in red blood cell (RBC) membranes, expressed as a proportion of total FAs, has been considered a risk factor for death from coronary heart disease (CHD) [52].Nutrients 2023 ,15, 4830 4 of 19 Nutrients 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 20 Figure 1.Synthesis of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fa tty acids in humans.Both linoleic acid (LA) and a-linolenic acid (ALA) are elongated, desaturated and β-oxidised using the same enzyme sys- tem.The bene ﬁcial eﬀect of the LC n-3 PUFAs on reducing the risk of cardiac mortality appears to be due to their incorporation into cardiomyocyte phospholipids at the expense of arachidonic acid [39,40].
The presence of n-3 PUFAs, particularly EPA, in the cell mem- branes can lead to the generation of di ﬀerent eicosanoids which can be more cardiopro- tective than those resulting from the arachidonic acid cascade [41–43]. Several potential mechanisms for the cardioprotective e ﬀect of omega-3 fa tty acids have been proposed with the e ﬀect on blood lipids, such as triglyceri des (TG), LDL, and HDL, associated with risk of atherosclerosis, being the most scienti ﬁcally proven [44,45].Particularly, the most consistent e ﬀect of n-3 PUFAs is the reduction in serum TG [46].There is a substantial confusion among the public and health pr ofessionals regarding the overall e ﬀects of n-3 PUFAs on blood lipi ds [47].It has been suggested that elevated TG levels are independent risk factors for the progression of CVD [48].In addition, smaller diameter LDL and HDL particles have been as sociated with increas ed risk [49,50].
The ‘Omega-3 index’ [51], which describes the content of EPA and DHA in red blood cell (RBC) membranes, expressed as a proportion of tota l FAs, has been considered a risk factor for death from coronary heart disease (CHD) [52]. Figure 1.Synthesis of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in humans.Both linoleic acid (LA) and a-linolenic acid (ALA) are elongated, desaturated and β-oxidised using the same enzyme system.2.2.1.Effect on Triglycerides According to Milte et al., circulating TG levels constitute an independent risk factor for CVD and are correlated with the severity and development of atherosclerosis [ 53].However, Torrejon et al., argued that unlike the well-established role of LDL-C in the development of CVD, the role of circulating TG concentrations in CVD development remains controversial [ 54].Nevertheless, according to the British Nutrition Foundation (BNF) (2005) [ 55], an indirect effect of TGs on CVD risk seems to be the case.
Research has shown that a reduction in TG levels leads to a lower abundance of small, dense LDL-C and therefore a reduced CVD risk (BNF, 2005) [55]. The most consistent effect of n-3 PUFAs is the decrease in fasting and postprandial serum TGs [ 48,54].However, the exact dose as well as exact duration of intervention, which can give the optimum TG-lowering effect is still unclear [ 53].So far, the majority of the studies have demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in TGs (25–30%) following treatment with doses≥3 g/day of LC n-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) mainly in the form of ﬁsh oil [ 56].In contrast, there is evidence showing a much lower effect following treatment with lower doses [ 57].The duration of studies ranged between 6 and 104 weeks, and the optimal duration of intervention remains unclear since no difference was found in TG Nutrients 2023 ,15, 4830 5 of 19 levels associated with longer trial duration (>16 weeks) compared to shorter trial duration (≤16 weeks) [33,58].
A double-blind randomized placebo controlled parallel study showed that DHA supplementation (3 g/day) for 45 days signiﬁcantly decreased fasting TG levels of hyper- triglyceridaemic men by 25–30%. Conversely, a double-blind placebo-controlled study [ 57] using a LC n-3 PUFA dose (1.8 g EPA and 0.3 g DHA) per day, which approximated the daily dietary intake upper limit (2 g of LC n-3 PUFAs) of the current UK guideline range (Scientiﬁc Advisory Committee on Nutrition, 2004) [ 59], had no effect on TG levels of nor- motriglyceridaemic individuals.Yusof et al.suggested that apart from the lower dose, the fact that the oil used was relatively poor in DHA might have contributed to the lack of effect.It is now believed that DHA is more potent in lowering TGs than EPA [ 60].Furthermore, it has been shown that the DHA TG-lowering effect is greater in hypertriglyceridaemic individuals compared with normotriglyceridaemic individuals [ 61,62].
A comprehensive meta-analysis (16511 participants in 47 studies included) assessing the role of n-3 PUFAs in treating hyperlipidaemia, demonstrated an average reduction of 14% in TG levels of hypertriglyceridaemic individuals following 6-month treatment with an average daily intake of 3.25 g of EPA and/or DHA [ 33]. However, this dose exceeds the safety limit (3 g/day) approved by the US food and drug administration (FDA) [63].2.2.2.Effect on Low-Density and High-Density Lipoprotein Particle Size Smaller diameter and denser LDL particles, such as LDL-3 subfraction, have been shown to be more susceptible to oxidation [ 50].In addition, they have an increased ability to penetrate the intima than larger, less dense LDL particles, such as LDL-1 and LDL-2 subfractions [ 50] and have, therefore, been associated with an increased coronary heart disease risk [ 50].A very recent systematic review concluded that small dense LDL are associated with an increased CVD risk [ 64].
According to Torrejon et al., particle size is signiﬁcantly increased with DHA supplementation. DHA supplementation reduces plasma TGs, contributing to a reduction in the number of small, dense LDL particles and subsequently to decreased CVD risk [49].Larger, more cholesterol-rich HDL particles (e.g., HDL-2 subfraction) are thought to facilitate a more efﬁcient reverse cholesterol transport compared with the smaller, less buoyant subfraction HDL-3, making them more cardioprotective [ 50,65,66].The HDL-2 subfraction has been shown to be increased in response to DHA, whilst it is not affected by EPA [54,65].This was conﬁrmed by a recent systematic review [67].2.2.3.Effect on ‘ n-3 Index’ Harris and von Schacky (2004) were the ﬁrst to propose that the content of EPA and DHA in RBC membranes, expressed as a proportion of total FAs, termed the ‘omega-3 index’, can be considered as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac death mortality [ 51].
Speciﬁcally, an ‘omega-3 Index’ level of ≥8% is a reasonable pre- liminary target value for reducing coronary heart disease risk. On the other hand, an ‘omega-3 Index’ < 4% has been implicated with a 10-fold greater risk of sudden cardiac death compared with an ‘omega-3 Index’ of ≥8% (Figure 2) [68,69].Nutrients 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 20 Harris and von Schacky (2004) were the ﬁrst to propose that the content of EPA and DHA in RBC membranes, expressed as a prop ortion of total FAs, termed the ‘omega-3 index’, can be considered as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac death mortality [51].Speci ﬁcally, an ‘omega-3 Index’ level of ≥8% is a reasonable prelimi- nary target value for reducing coronary hear t disease risk.On the other hand, an ‘omega- 3 Index’ < 4% has been implicated with a 10 -fold greater risk of sudden cardiac death compared with an ‘omega-3 Index’ of ≥8% (Figure 2) [68,69].Figure 2.Proposed risk zones for the ‘omega-3 index’.
An increased proportion of the LC n-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) in erythrocyte mem- branes following consumption of oily ﬁsh has been demonstrated [70]. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel tria l investigated the association between in- creases in erythrocyte DHA content and change s in blood lipids in 67 healthy individuals following DHA intake for 3 months [53].Participants were randomised to receive 0.52 g, 1.04 g, 1.56 g DHA or 1 g Sunola oil (control).At the end of the 3-month intervention the 0.52 g, 1.04 g, 1.56 g DHA doses increased the proportion of DHA in erythrocytes to a dose-dependent manner (7.1%, 7.9% and 9% of total FAs, respectively) [53].3.Factors Implicated in the E ﬃcacy of PUFAs 3.1.Variability in the Clinical E ﬀects of n-3 PUFAs Following supplement uptake, n-3 PUFAs are incorporated into cell membranes and plasma lipids in a dose- and time-dependent manner, replacing other fa tty acid types, including n-6 PUFAs [71].
n-3 PUFA incorporation lead to changes in cell signaling by aﬀecting the cell membrane structure and ﬂuidity and changing the function of cell sur- face receptors and ion channels. The e ﬀects of n-3 PUFAs on atherosclerosis are conferred through molecular mechanisms that involve changes in the cell membrane composition, eicosanoid synthesis, transcription factor ac tivity and gene expression [72].EPA and DHA are known to have di ﬀerential metabolism, and divergent e ﬀects on the molecular mech- anisms of atherosclerosis.Antagonism between the two types of n-3 PUFAs, may explain the con ﬂicting ﬁndings of large clinical studies on the e ﬀects of n-3 PUFAs on CVD risk factors [73–76].The e ﬀects of n-3 PUFAs on atherosclerosis risk factors depend on di ﬀerent considerations including their dose and le ngth of supplementation, EPA/DHA composi- tion and formulation [77].
Under standing how these factors a ﬀect their incorporation into the lipid pool, their metabolism and their downstream molecular e ﬀects will allow more eﬀective design of n-3 PUFA supplementation stra tegies for CVD prevention. 3.2.Incorporation of EPA an d DHA into the Lipid Pool EPA and DHA show di ﬀerential metabolism-, tissue-, and compartment-speci ﬁc ac- cumulation following supplementation, which may a ﬀect their function.Supplementa- tion with EPA and DHA leads to a dose-dependent increase in plasma, which reaches equilibrium approx.one month post-supplementation [78].Studies suggest a very low conversion of EPA to DHA following supplementation.However, DHA supplementation increases plasma EPA concentrations, possibly due to retro-conversion or slow EPA turn- over [78,79].
Following ﬁsh oil supplementation, EPA pref erentially accumulates in cho- lesteryl esters within very low-density lipop roteins (VLDL), possibly due to increased se- lectivity of the enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase to EPA [80–82]. On the other Figure 2.Proposed risk zones for the ‘omega-3 index’.An increased proportion of the LC n-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) in erythrocyte mem- branes following consumption of oily ﬁsh has been demonstrated [ 70].A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial investigated the association between in- Nutrients 2023 ,15, 4830 6 of 19 creases in erythrocyte DHA content and changes in blood lipids in 67 healthy individuals following DHA intake for 3 months [ 53].Participants were randomised to receive 0.52 g, 1.04 g, 1.56 g DHA or 1 g Sunola oil (control).
At the end of the 3-month intervention the 0.52 g, 1.04 g, 1.56 g DHA doses increased the proportion of DHA in erythrocytes to a dose-dependent manner (7.1%, 7.9% and 9% of total FAs, respectively) [53]. 3.Factors Implicated in the Efﬁcacy of PUFAs 3.1.Variability in the Clinical Effects of n-3 PUFAs Following supplement uptake, n-3 PUFAs are incorporated into cell membranes and plasma lipids in a dose- and time-dependent manner, replacing other fatty acid types, including n-6 PUFAs [ 71].n-3 PUFA incorporation lead to changes in cell signaling by affecting the cell membrane structure and ﬂuidity and changing the function of cell surface receptors and ion channels.The effects of n-3 PUFAs on atherosclerosis are conferred through molecular mechanisms that involve changes in the cell membrane composition, eicosanoid synthesis, transcription factor activity and gene expression [ 72].
EPA and DHA are known to have differential metabolism, and divergent effects on the molecular mecha- nisms of atherosclerosis. Antagonism between the two types of n-3 PUFAs, may explain the conﬂicting ﬁndings of large clinical studies on the effects of n-3 PUFAs on CVD risk factors [ 73–76].The effects of n-3 PUFAs on atherosclerosis risk factors depend on different considerations including their dose and length of supplementation, EPA/DHA composi- tion and formulation [ 77].Understanding how these factors affect their incorporation into the lipid pool, their metabolism and their downstream molecular effects will allow more effective design of n-3 PUFA supplementation strategies for CVD prevention.3.2.Incorporation of EP A and DHA into the Lipid Pool EPA and DHA show differential metabolism-, tissue-, and compartment-speciﬁc accu- mulation following supplementation, which may affect their function.
Supplementation with EPA and DHA leads to a dose-dependent increase in plasma, which reaches equilib- rium approx. one month post-supplementation [ 78].Studies suggest a very low conversion of EPA to DHA following supplementation.However, DHA supplementation increases plasma EPA concentrations, possibly due to retro-conversion or slow EPA turnover [ 78,79].Following ﬁsh oil supplementation, EPA preferentially accumulates in cholesteryl esters within very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), possibly due to increased selectivity of the enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase to EPA [ 80–82].On the other hand, DHA is a preferential substrate for diacylglycerol acyltransferase leading to increased incorporation into TG [81–83].The source and formulation of n-3-PUFA supplements also affects their bioavailability and consequently their lipid incorporation.
Studies comparing the incorporation of EPA and DHA into plasma lipids after short-term supplementation with nutritional or phar- macological doses (>3 g/day) of n-3-PUFAs, in the forms of free fatty acids, ethyl esters or re-esteriﬁed TG, have reported conﬂicting ﬁndings [ 84–87]. However, a clinical study investigating the effect of prolonged supplementation (6 months) of dyslipidemic patients on statins with moderate doses of n-3-PUFAs (1.01 g EPA and 0.67 g DHA), reported that the re-esteriﬁed triglyceride formulation showed higher incorporation into red blood cell membranes and a more effective reduction in fasting plasma TG, compared to the ethyl ester formulation [ 88,89].The above study reiterates the importance of supplement formulation and length of treatment on its effectiveness.3.3.Effects of EP A and DHA on Lipoprotein Metabolism High levels of blood TG, transported by the TG-rich VLDLs and chylomicrons, increase the risk for atherosclerosis [ 90].
Dietary supplementation with ﬁsh oil or with pure EPA and DHA, attenuates plasma TG by inhibiting TG synthesis and VLDL production, and inducing apolipoprotein B degradation in hepatocytes [ 91–94]. Furthermore, n-3-PUFAs limit the supply of plasma non-esteriﬁed fatty acids for VLDL synthesis through inhibition Nutrients 2023 ,15, 4830 7 of 19 of intracellular lipolysis in adipocytes [ 95,96].Accelerated chylomicron clearance through induction of lipolysis has also been shown to be induced by both DHA and EPA [ 97].A number of studies also demonstrate that n-3-PUFAs supplementation increases HDL levels; however, there are studies showing contradicting ﬁndings [65,98–100].Studies using high doses of puriﬁed EPA and DHA, given separately or together, alone or in combination with statins, show a signiﬁcant improvement of dyslipidemia [ 89,101,102].
Skulas-Ray et al., reported that supplementation with high doses (3.4 g/d) of EPA and DHA for eight weeks led to a signiﬁcant reduction in plasma TG, whilst a lower dose (0.85 g/d) had no signiﬁcant effect. Neither of the doses had any effect on endothelial function and inﬂammatory markers, possibly because the study subjects were healthy [ 102].These ﬁndings suggest that high doses of puriﬁed n-3 PUFAs may be required to achieve optimum clinical efﬁcacy.However, a number of studies using EPA or DHA monotherapy report differential effects or efﬁcacies of the two fatty acids on plasma lipids.The randomised cross-over study ComparED, compared the effect of DHA and EPA (2.7 g/day), formulated as re-esteriﬁed triacylglycerol, on blood lipids and inﬂammatory markers in subjects with abdominal obesity and subclinical inﬂammation.The study reported that DHA may be more effective in reducing TG, and increasing HDL- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, compared to EPA.
Apolipoprotein B levels were also reduced by DHA, but not by EPA [ 103]. A secondary analysis of the ComparED study results indicated that the increased efﬁcacy of DHA in reducing TG does not depend on a greater effect magnitude but on the fact that a greater proportion of study subjects responded to DHA compared to EPA [ 104].Previous studies also investigated the effect of supplementation with highly pure, free, or esteriﬁed, DHA or EPA (>3 g/day) for 4–7 weeks on the plasma lipid proﬁle of healthy or hypertensive subjects.These studies report mixed ﬁndings, with some showing a superior effect of DHA compared to EPA supplementation and others no difference between the two n-3 PUFAs [ 97,105–108].A meta-analysis of these studies concluded that overall DHA reduces TG and increases LDL and HDL cholesterol, to a greater extent than EPA [ 109].
High doses (3–4 g/day) of EPA or DHA were shown to be equally efﬁcient in inducing liposome lipase activity, suggesting that the superior triglyceride-lowering effect of DHA is not due to a more efﬁcient chylomicron/VLDL clearance [97,110]. Early studies have demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs reduce TG levels, at least partly , through inhibition of acyl CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), an enzyme catalysing the terminal step of TG synthesis [ 111].n-3 PUFAs also act by inhibiting hepatic de novo synthesis of fatty acids and TG and inducing fatty acid oxidation and TG catabolism in adipose tissue and muscle [ 112].These effects are mediated by modulating the activity of transcription factors, and more speciﬁcally the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) [ 72].
SREBPs are cellular fatty acid sensors, which are activated by proteolytic release from the endoplasmic reticulum leading to their translocation to the nucleus, where they activate lipogenic gene transcription. SREB-1a and -1c isoforms are transcribed from the SREBP-1 gene under the regulation of different promoters [ 113].PUFAs, including n-3 PUFAs, inhibit SREBP-1 activation by preventing its proteolytic release from the ER, and reducing its gene expression by competing with its transcriptional activator heterodimer liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) or by increasing its mRNA degradation [ 114–116].RXR also form heterodimers with the nuclear receptors PPARs, which act as lipid sensors by binding to a number of different intracellular fatty acids species.PPAR α, predominantly expressed in the liver, and PPAR β/δthat show higher expression in the skeletal and cardiac muscle, drive mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation gene transcription.
PPAR γis mainly found in adipose tissue where it regulates adipocyte differentiation and activity, including lipoprotein lipase activity and fatty acid oxidation. n-3 PUFAs act as ligands of RXR and all three PPAR isoforms, activating fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein lipase gene expression [117–119].Nutrients 2023 ,15, 4830 8 of 19 Evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies suggests that EPA and DHA may differ- entially regulate these molecular transcriptional pathways.Studies in rat hepatocytes have shown that EPA is a more effective inhibitor of DGAT activity, compared to DHA.Furthermore, although EPA and DHA activate PPAR αto a similar extent, EPA activates mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, whilst DHA drives only peroxisomal fatty acid oxida- tion [ 83,120,121].
This is a result of differential substrate preference of each pathway, with EPA being oxidised both in microsomes and mitochondria, whereas DHA is only oxidised in microsomes [ 83] Based on these experimental ﬁndings, EPA may have a greater inﬂuence on TG levels, as mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation has a more signiﬁcant inﬂuence on fatty acid availability for triglyceride synthesis, compared to microsomal oxidation [ 122]. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies comparing the effects of EPA and DHA on fatty acid oxidation in humans.Studies in rat models have shown that EPA and DHA inhibit lipogenesis both sepa- rately and in combination [ 123].EPA has also been shown to inhibit LXR/RXR-SREBP-1c interaction more potently than DHA, in a human embryonic kidney cell line [ 114].
How- ever, a randomised control trial, comparing the effects of DHA and EPA (3 g/day) on plasma triglyceride metabolism in young healthy subjects, reported that although both n-3-PUFAs inhibited liposome lipase activity, EPA increased the lipogenic index and failed to reduce plasma triglyceride levels. In contrast, DHA did not modulate the lipogenic index and signiﬁcantly reduced triglyceride levels [110].4.Speciﬁc PUFAs as Anti-Inﬂammatory and Anti-Oxidative Mediators 4.1.Effects of EP A and DHA on Inﬂammation Another way through which n-3-PUFAs exert their protective effect against atheroscle- rosis, is by reducing vascular inﬂammation.Randomised control trials show that a mix of DHA and EPA in different proportions and formulations reduces plasma inﬂamma- tory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6 and TNF α, and increases the anti- inﬂammatory mediator adiponectin [ 124,125].
A recent meta-analysis of studies directly comparing the effects of DHA and EPA on plasma inﬂammation concluded that the two n-3-PUFAs do not have signiﬁcantly differential effects on CRP , IL-6, TNF αand adiponectin [126]. n-3-PUFAs exert their anti-inﬂammatory effect by modulating the balance between pro- and anti-inﬂammatory lipid mediators.Following their release from phospholipids by phospholipases, PUFAs are metabolised by cyclooxygenases (COX), lipoxygenases (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) into oxylipins that can act as endogenous mediators.n-6-PUFAs, such as arachidonic acid, act as pre-cursors for pro-inﬂammatory and pro- thrombotic eicosanoids, such as the 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and the 4- series leukotrienes.EPA gives rise to 3-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes and 5-series leukotrienes, which are less inﬂammatory.
Furthermore, EPA and DHA promote inﬂamma- tion resolution by being metabolised into anti-inﬂammatory mediators, such as resolvins derived from EPA and DHA, and protectins and maresins derived from DHA [ 127–129]. EPA and DHA promote an anti-inﬂammatory environment by competing with arachidonic acid for the metabolic enzyme sites, thus reducing the production of pro-inﬂammatory eicosanoids.Indeed, clinical studies have shown that moderate- or high-dose supple- mentation with EPA and DHA ethyl esters increases n-3-PUFA-derived anti-inﬂammatory oxylipins, whilst reducing n-6-derived eicosanoids in human plasma [130–132] .Differ- ences in the metabolism of EPA and DHA can introduce variability in their clinical effects.CYP450 isoforms have differences with respect to their speciﬁcity for each n-3-PUFA, whilst the metabolism of EPA and DHA may also be affected by differences in CYP450 catalytic activity due to gene polymorphisms [ 133,134].
Therefore, tissue-dependent, and inter- individual differences in the expression and activities of CYP450 isoforms may lead to variation in the anti-inﬂammatory to EPA and DHA. n-3-PUFAs also inhibit pro-inﬂammatory signaling pathways.Activation of PPAR γby DHA and EPA leads to inhibition of the pro-inﬂammatory transcription factor nuclear factor Nutrients 2023 ,15, 4830 9 of 19 (NF)- κB and up-regulation of adiponectin production by adipocytes [ 135–137].n-3-PUFAs also promote anti-inﬂammatory effects by binding to the G-protein coupled receptor Free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4/GPR120), which is highly expressed in adipose tissue and macrophages.Upon binding to n-3-PUFAs, FFAR4 promotes calcium-dependent regulation of physiological processes, including glucose metabolism and adipogenesis, and recruits and activates the scaffold protein β-arrestin-2 that has anti-inﬂammatory effects [ 138].
Speciﬁcally, the FFAR4/ β-arrestin-2 complex inhibits NF- κB activation and the formation of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inﬂammasome in macrophages. NLRP3 is a cytosolic protein complex that senses metabolic stress signals, such as cholesterol crystals, triggering the activation of the inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1 βand IL-18 [139,140].A number of in vitro studies in different cell types demonstrate that EPA and DHA differentially regulate inﬂammatory mechanisms.In the monocytic cell line THP-1, EPA and DHA were shown to inhibit NF- κB activity through two distinct signaling cascades [ 141].Moreover, a study in the human colon carcinoma cell line CaCo-2 demonstrated that both EPA and DHA alone can trigger FFAR4-dependent inhibition of NF- κB with the same efﬁcacy but with different kinetics, possibly due to different afﬁnity to the receptor [ 142].
On the other hand, experiments in HT29, another colon carcinoma cell, line show that EPA activates both calcium and β-arrestin-2-mediated signaling, whilst DHA showed no calcium activation and weak β-arrestin-2 recruitment [ 143]. Human FFAR4 shows two alternative splice variants; the short form triggers both calcium- and arrestin-mediated cascades and the long form only drives arrestin signaling [ 144].The relative responses of EPA and DHA on FFAR4 may therefore depend on the relative expression of each isoform, which can be cell line-, tissue- and/or disease-speciﬁc, and the relative afﬁnity of each fatty acid for each isoform.In a rat model of myocardial infarction, EPA was shown to have a stronger anti-inﬂammatory effect compared to DHA, by maintaining a higher PPAR γ activity through inhibition of its phosphorylation [145].4.2.
Effects of EP A and DHA on Lipid Oxidation Dyslipidemia and oxidative stress promote oxidized (ox)LDL and cholesterol crystal domain formation in endothelial cell membranes, which promote endothelial dysfunction and vascular inﬂammation. OxLDL triggers endothelial activation and the recruitment of macrophages leading to the formation of foam cells, which promote inﬂammation and atherosclerotic plague destabilisation [ 146].Cholesterol crystal domains promote inﬂammation by activating the NLRP3 inﬂammasome, a protein complex that triggers caspase-induced activation of the cytokines IL-1 βand IL-18 [ 147].Both EPA and DHA, and their oxidation products, protect against LDL and cell membrane oxidation by directly scavenging reactive oxygen species, and by increasing endogenous antioxidant gene expres- sion through activation of the cytoprotective transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) [ 148–151].
EPA was shown to have a stronger and more prolonged protective effect against LDL oxidation and cholesterol crystal domain formation, com- pared to DHA, in in vitro studies. This may be due to the chemical structure of EPA, and speciﬁcally the combination of its hydrocarbon length and location of double bonds, which allows more efﬁcient electron stabilization [152,153].4.3.Effects of EP A and DHA on Cell Death Evidence supports the protective effects of n-3 PUFAs against apoptosis and cell death in atherosclerosis.EPA/DHA-rich oxLDL obtained from healthy subjects following ﬁsh oil supplementation, was shown to trigger less apoptosis in a monocytic cell line, compared to control oxLDL [ 154].Furthermore, DHA supplementation (400–1600 mg/day) of healthy subjects for two weeks was shown to dose-dependently reduce the susceptibility of peripheral blood monocytes to oxLDL-dependent apoptosis [ 155].
In line with these clinical observations, in vitro studies report that oxidised EPA and DHA promote monocyte- derived macrophage apoptosis, but to a lesser extent than oxidised arachidonic acid, whilst DHA inhibits saturated fatty acid-induced endothelial cell apoptosis [ 156,157]. Maresin-1, Nutrients 2023 ,15, 4830 10 of 19 a DHA metabolite, also inhibits endothelial cell inﬂammatory responses and apoptosis by activating PPAR α-mediated signaling [158].A study in an obese mouse model showed that an imbalance in saturated fatty acid/ n- 3 PUFA levels in peritoneal macrophage membranes is associated with impaired removal of apoptotic cells by efferocytosis, due to altered phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity.Intriguingly, the same study showed that ﬁsh oil supplementation normalised efferocytosis, indicating a role of n-3 PUFAs in effective clearance of apoptotic cells [ 159].
Indeed, DHA was shown to enhance the efferocytosis activity of macrophages by driving their differenti- ation to a more anti-inﬂammatory and pro-resolving phenotype via a PPAR γ-dependent mechanism [ 160]. The DHA metabolite Resolvin D1 also promotes the efferocytosis of necroptotic cells by promoting cytoskeletal changes, and mitochondrial respiration and ATP production [161,162].The above studies show the complexity of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of EPA and DHA on lipoprotein metabolism and oxidation, and inﬂammation.This is further compounded by the heterogeneity of the in vitro and in vivo models used, due to differences in experimental conditions, and tissue- and species-speciﬁc differences in signaling pathways.Furthermore, these models do not accurately represent the in vivo situation, where there is interaction between multiple cells, such as between immune cells with endothelial cells and adipocytes.
Development of more reproducible and accurate models would enable a better understanding of mechanisms of action of EPA and DHA in order to determine their relative efﬁcacies and optimise supplementation composition. 5.Epigenetic Determinants of n-3-PUFA Effects An interesting observation from the ComparED study is that only 26% of subjects responded to either DHA or EPA.As the compliance of the study subjects was approxi- mately 95%, the lack of response was probably not due to non-compliance but due to other factors [ 104].This suggests that the variability observed in clinical studies could be a result of inter-individual differences in the response to n-3 PUFAs.These differences may stem from genomic differences, as a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in lipid metabolism and triglyceride synthesis have been associated with the effect ofn-3 PUFAs on plasma TG [ 163–166].
Epigenetic mechanisms may also contribute to the variability in the response to n-3 PUFAs. Availability of n-3 PUFAs, particularly DHA, is required for one-carbon metabolism that leads to the production of S-adenosyl methionine, the methyl donor of DNA methy- lation [ 167].Indeed, a number of clinical studies in the last 10 years have demonstrated an effect of n-3 PUFAs on DNA methylation.DNA methylation analysis on blood from Yupik natives identiﬁed 27 differentially-methylated CpG sites that correlated with the levels of n-3 PUFA intake, including the fatty acid synthase gene, and the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor gene involved in antioxidant protection [ 168].Furthermore, a study in lactating infants and adult men reported a strong association between EPA and arachidonic acid levels with global DNA methylation, with EPA having a stronger association than arachidonic acid [ 169].
A randomised control study in healthy or chronic kidney disease patients showed that 4 g/day n-3 PUFAs (1.8 g EPA, 0.2 g DPA, 1.5 g DHA ethyl esters) for 8 weeks, led to altered CpG methylation in the 5′-regulatory region of fatty acid desaturase (FADS) 2 gene, encoding ∆6 desaturase, and elongase (ELOVL)-5 that encodes elongase 5, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [ 170]. A study conducted in PBMCs from obese subjects on a low-calorie diet found that supplementation with n-3 PUFA-rich ﬁsh oil for 8 weeks altered CpG methylation at a speciﬁc site in the CD36 gene, a membrane glyco- protein that is involved in lipid uptake, including oxLDL internalisation, in macrophages.Nonetheless, the changes in methylation reported were very small suggesting that they may not affect gene expression [ 171].Studies have also investigated the effects of prenatal n-3 PUFA supplementation on the infant epigenome.
Supplementation of pregnant women with DHA (400 mg/day) from gestation week 18–22 until birth was associated with increased methylation of the imprinted genes insulin- Nutrients 2023 ,15, 4830 11 of 19 like growth factor 2 ( IGF2 ) and H19 in umbilical cord mononuclear cells, compared to the control group [172]. IGF2 /H19 differentially methylated regions have been associated with the risk of higher birth and early life weight [ 173,174].A subsequent randomised control study reported that supplementation of pregnant women with DHA-rich ﬁsh oil (800 mg/day) from gestational week 20 until delivery did not signiﬁcantly alter global DNA methylation in blood leukocytes, but induced small changes in the methylation of a subset of genes involved in lipid metabolism, appetite regulation and immune function [ 175].
Similarly, a study on 9-month-old infants supplemented with EPA/DHA-rich ﬁsh oil (1.6 g/day) for 9 months, showed no statistically-signiﬁcant difference in global DNA methylation [176]. The above studies show that n-3 PUFAs may promote their clinical effects through epigenomic re-programming.However, the ﬁndings show small changes in DNA methy- lation, which may not have important functional consequences.This may be due to the small sample size of the studies or to insufﬁcient n-3 PUFAs dose.Furthermore, as DNA methylation patterns are tissue-speciﬁc, epigenetic analysis of other tissues may lead to a more complete picture of the epigenetic effects of n-3 PUFAs.Importantly, functional studies are required in order to understand the clinical implications of these changes.6.Conclusions and Outlook CVD is the leading cause of mortality worldwide [ 68].It is more than clear nowadays that n-3 PUFAs do not only serve as an inert form of energy storage [ 177].
Epidemiological studies and randomized control trials have reported that n-3 PUFAs might reduce cardio- vascular events [ 54]. The evidence of the beneﬁts of n-3 PUFAs is stronger in secondary than in primary prevention settings [ 34].Several potential mechanisms for the cardioprotective effect of n-3 PUFAs have been proposed, with the effect on blood lipids being the most scientiﬁcally proven [ 44,45].Particularly, their most consistent effect is the reduction in serum TG [ 54].Nonetheless, there are conﬂicting ﬁndings regarding their clinical beneﬁts, leading to uncertainty regarding their use for preventing atherosclerosis [ 26].Several factors need to be considered when designing clinical studies, especially when natural ingredients and natural extracts are tested for efﬁcacy.Firstly, as the TG-lowering effects ofn-3 PUFA are dose-dependent, the use of consistent, and preferably high doses, across studies may lead to more meaningful results [ 102].
Secondly, the selection of suitable study subjects is crucial as n-3 PUFAs were shown to have a more pronounced effect in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia [ 61]. Thirdly, the selection of the chemical form, composition, and EPA/DHA ratio of n-3 PUFA is an important factor, as it affects their overall molecular effects.Another important factor in accurately collecting data is the consideration of the run-in period that is about 3 to 6 months from the time of the supplement ﬁrst consumed.A period that is known for some natural products as required to indicate activity.Optimising the EPA and DHA content of n-3 PUFA supplements requires a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving their effects.Currently most of the available mechanistic data have been obtained from in vitro and animal models, whilst very limited data from humans are available [ 178].
Moving towards 3-dimentional organoid cultures of patient-derived cells would permit studying the effects of n-3 PUFAs in an environment that more closely resembles the human in vivo situation. This approach will generate data that can be more easily translated into clinical studies.Another important issue is identifying or predicting which patients respond to n-3 PUFA supplementation in order to provide more personalised management.More exten- sive and better-powered epigenomic studies, accompanied by functional studies, would elucidate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the cellular effects of n-3 PUFAs, as well as epigenetic biomarkers for predicting responders or non-responders.In line with this notion, transcriptomics analysis of PBMCs of responders or non-responders to the TG-lowering effect of EPA/DHA-rich ﬁsh oil (1.6 g/day), identiﬁed differentially regulated genes be- tween the two groups [ 179].
Future studies could use transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis to identify gene and metabolite signatures, which could be used as biomarkers for Nutrients 2023 ,15, 4830 12 of 19 predicting patients that would beneﬁt from the use of n-3 PUFAs. This could involve per- forming DNA methylation, transcriptomics and/or metabolomics analysis of blood plasma samples before and after treatment with n-3 PUFAs supplements.The potential biomarkers could then be correlated with blood lipids, and inﬂammatory and thrombotic markers, and their predictive accuracy determined.Furthermore, integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics data can be used in order to identify new n-3-PUFA-regulated path- ways, which could lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying their effects.Concluding, the existing clinical trials are not appropriately designed considering all important parameters to correctly evaluate their efﬁcacy in the treatment of different CVDs.
High doses and ratio with DHA in excess might be the answer to the mystery. All the rational and biochemical networks that can be affected by the use of these natural molecules as supplements suggest the need for carefully designed basic experimental studies and clinical trials in order to reach accurate conclusions on their efﬁcacy in treating different CVDs.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, A.S.and I.P .; writing—original draft preparation, C.M., S.C., P .C.and T.-C.K.; writing—review and editing, A.S., I.P .and C.M.All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.Funding: This research received no external funding.Conﬂicts of Interest: The authors declare no conﬂict of interest.References 1.Frostegard, J.Immunity, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.BMC Med.2013 ,11, 117.[CrossRef] 2.Libby, P .Inﬂammation in atherosclerosis.Nature 2002 ,420, 868–874.[CrossRef] [PubMed] 3.
