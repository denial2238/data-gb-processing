Human muscle biopsies and mouse models of NF1 deficiency in muscle show intramyocellular lipid accumulation, and preclinical data have indicated that L-carnitine supplementation can ameliorate this phenotype.The aim of this study is to examine whether daily L-carnitine supplementation is safe and feasible, and will improve muscle strength and reduce fatigue in children with NF1.A 12-week Phase 2a trial was conductedusing 1000 mg daily oral levocarnitine tartrate supplementation.Recruited children were between 8 and 12 years old with a clinical diagnosis of NF1, history of muscle weakness and fatigue, and naïve to L-carnitine.
Primary outcomes were safety (self- reporting, biochemical testing) and compliance. Secondary outcomes included plasma acylcarnitine profiles, functional measures (muscle strength, long jump, handwritingspeed, 6-minute-walk test [6MWT]), and parent-reported questionnaires (PedsQL ™, CBCL/6 –18).Six children completed the trial with no self-reported adverse events.Biochemical tests for kidney and liver function were normal, and the average compli- ance was 95%.Plasma acylcarnitine levels were low, but within a range not clinicallyReceived: 14 December 2020 Revised: 17 May 2021 Accepted: 27 May 2021 DOI: 10.1002/ajmg.a.62392 This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and repro duction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes.© 2021 The Authors.American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.
2976 Am J Med Genet. 2021;185A:2976 –2985.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ajmga linked to carnitine deficiency.For strength measures, there was a mean 53% increase in dorsiflexion strength (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.89 –60.75; p=0.02) and mean 66% increase in plantarflexion strength (95% CI 12.99 –134.1; p=0.03).In terms of muscle performance, there was a mean 10% increase in long jump distance (95% CI 2.97–16.03; p=0.01) and 6MWT distance (95% CI 5.88 –75.45; p=0.03).Compari- son with the 1000 Norms Project data showed a significant improvement in Z-score for all of these measures.Parent reports showed no negative impact on quality of life, and the perceived benefits led to the majority of individuals remaining on L-carnitine after the study.Twelve weeks of L-carnitine supplementation is safe and feasible inchildren with NF1, and a Phase 3 trial should confirm the efficacy of treatment.
KEYWORDS children, fatigue, L-carnitine, muscle weakness, neurofibromatosis type 1, NF1 1|INTRODUCTION Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common autosomal domi- nant genetic disorder, with a birth incidence of 1:3000 globally(Friedman, 2002). NF1 is caused by inactivating mutations in the NF1 gene located on chromosome 17q11.2 (Shen et al., 1996).The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a RAS-specific GTPase activating protein thatmodulates the biological activity of RAS proteins (Shen et al., 1996), andthus NF1 is classified as a tumor suppressor gene.While tumors are often the focus of clinical management at all stages of life, children with NF1 can be challenged by reductions in lean tissue mass, global muscleweakness, and problems in fine and gross motor functioning (Cornett et al., 2015; Dulai et al., 2007; Summers et al., 2015).They also express higher levels of physical and cognitive fatigue (Vassallo et al., 2020).
In astudy of self-concept, approximately 30% of children and adolescents with NF1 reported a low self-concept for physical and sporting abilities (Barton & North, 2007). There are currently no effective interventionsfor managing the physical limitations associated with NF1.Summers et al.(2018) showed that double inactivation of Nf1in murine muscle leads to intramyocellular lipid accumulation, which was also observed in NF1 patient muscle biopsies Summers et al., 2018).This phenotype was reminiscent of metabolic myopathies, a series of conditions that are often managed by L-carnitine supplementation and/or dietary enrichment with medium-chain fatty acids.Treatmentof the Nf1 Prx1/C0//C0mouse with this intervention led to a decrease in the accumulation of long-chain fats in the muscle, leading to a 45% increase in grip strength following a 12-week treatment.L-carnitine is a vital molecular component of several energy produc- ing pathways (Bremer, 1983).
Greater than 95% of the body's total car- nitine is localized in skeletal muscle, where it is necessary for thetransport of long-chain fatty acids through the mitochondrial membranefor beta-oxidation (Stephens et al., 2007). Normally, the body's require- ments for carnitine are met by the consumption of meat, but endoge- nous synthesis and increased renal absorption efficiency can contributeto whole-body carnitine homeostasis.Impairments in L-carnitine synthe- sis, transport or metabolism can result in primary or secondarydeficiencies, which can in turn lead to elevated levels of intramyocellular lipid in muscle biopsies (Vasiljevski et al., 2018).Carnitine deficiency often results in muscle weakness and increased physical fatigue.L-carnitine supplementation is frequently recommended to patients with carnitine deficiency syndromes.
Primary carnitine defi- ciency responds dramatically to oral carnitine therapy, with a com- plete reversal of clinical symptoms within a month (Al-sharefi &Bilous, 2015; Tomlinson et al., 2018). Patients with other disordersthat feature a secondary carnitine deficiency, such as kidney disease and dialysis patients, and very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency can also receive benefits from carnitine replacement ther-apy (Ahmad, 2001; Touma et al., 2001).L-carnitine supplementation has never been examined as a clinical treatment for muscle weakness or physical fatigue in the context ofNF1.
Hence, this study represents the first proof-of-concept trial to examine compliance, safety, and efficacy of levocarnitine tartrate treat- ment in children with NF1-associated muscle weakness and fatigue.While prior studies have tested L-carnitine for pediatric and adult con-ditions, deficiencies in fatty acid metabolism in NF1 muscle identified by preclinical studies justify safety testing in this specific patient group. To explore evidence for a secondary carnitine deficiency or other meta-bolic deficit, patients were assessed in terms of their plasma acylcarnitine profile.Our hypotheses were that: (1) daily 1000 mg levocarnitine tartrate supplementation (two divided doses) in childrenwith NF1-associated muscle weakness and fatigue would be safe, feasi- ble, and acceptable to families; (2) changes in strength and endurance measures may be detectable; and (3) plasma acylcarnitine profiling mayshow evidence of a secondary carnitine deficiency.
2|SUBJECTS AND METHODS 2.1 |Study design and participants This open-label, single-arm, single center, Phase 2a clinical trial was designed to assess the safety and compliance of L-carnitineVASILJEVSKI ET AL. 2977 supplementation in children with NF1.The trial was registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry with ACTRNnumber 12618002021257 (Study protocol: https://anzctr.org.au/ Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN =12618002021257).The study was approved and monitored by the Sydney Children's Hospi-tal Network Human Research Ethics Committee (reference no.HREC/18/SCHN/288).Participants were children between 8 and 12 years of age that fulfilled: (1) the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference diagnostic criteria for NF1, (2) reported a history of muscle weakness and/or physical fatigue, and (3) were naïve to L-carnitine supplemen-tation.The clinic provides NF1 specialist services to children in theGreater Sydney Metropolitan Region.
Prior to the initial assessment, a medical history of all participants was obtained from the parent(s), and the participant's medical file. Participants were excluded from thestudy if they met any of the following criteria: (1) severe cognitive impairment, (2) insufficient English, (3) seizures, (4) skeletal abnormali- ties, e.g.tibial bowing and pseudarthrosis, acute foot or lower limbinjuries, e.g.fracture and ankle sprain, or (5) incapacity to comply with a research protocol, e.g.prolonged absence.Written informed con- sent was obtained from all parents and assent from children as devel-opmentally appropriate.2.2 |Procedures All participants were allocated a daily dose of 1000 mg Levocarnitine tartrate (Musashi, Vitaco Health Australia Pty Ltd).Hard capsules(500 mg) were consumed twice daily for 12 weeks.The families were instructed to provide the children with the capsules at breakfast and dinner time, roughly 10 h apart.
L-carnitine is an over-the-counter nutraceutical supplement taken to improve fatty acid oxidation and energy production. L-carnitine supplementation is used to treat primary carnitine deficiency.How-ever, as L-carnitine supplementation had never been previously clini-cally trialed in NF1, we started the first three participants 1 month apart.As there were no adverse events in these children, the remaining three participants were started on L-carnitine supplementa-tion at fortnightly intervals.L-carnitine was dispensed from the Pharmacy Department of The Children's Hospital at Westmead.Functional assessments and ques-tionnaires were carried out at the Kids Research Clinical Research Cen- tre, The Children's Hospital at Westmead.A trained clinical evaluator took all functional assessments in the same order at baseline (0 weeks)and end of study (12 weeks).Questionnaires were completed by the parents at baseline and 12-weeks posttreatment.
Blood was collected and analyzed by the Pathology Department of The Children's Hospitalat Westmead. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 12-weeksposttreatment, and urine was collected at 12 weeks.Participants were given the option to continue L-carnitine supple- mentation at their own cost after the study endpoint (12 weeks), andwere followed up after 3 months.The participants were asked whether they chose to continue L-carnitine treatment, and what theirregimen was.They were also asked to complete the same set of ques- tionnaires after this period.2.3 |Outcome measures The primary outcome measures for this study were safety and compli- ance.Safety was primarily analyzed by adverse event self-reporting.Aweekly phone call was made to each participant's family to ensure any safety concerns or adverse events were expressed.Additionally, there were three in-person consultations for each participant, which werescheduled prior to each functional assessment.
Biochemical safetyassessments included plasma liver function (Supporting Table 1), urine chemistry (Supporting Table 2), circulating triglycerides and choles- terols, and acylcarnitine profiling (Supporting Table 3). At the finalconsultation, participants returned any remaining capsules.The num- bers of remaining capsules were counted to assess their compliance.The intervention was declared safe and feasible if: (1) no more thanone of the six participants withdrew due to experiencing an adverse event attributable to treatment, and (2) at least four of the six partici- pants were able to complete at least 75% of the prescribed dose oftreatment and comply with study requirements.
Secondary outcomes were functional assessments, including body fat, measures of muscle strength (grip, dorsiflexion and plantarflexion),gait, power (long jump), fine motor function (hand writing speed test),gross motor function (6 minute-walk-test [6MWT]) and quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life and Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6 –18). Body fat was measured using the MC-780MA Tanita Tokyo bodycomposition analyzer.The MC-780MA body composition analyzer divides the human body into five sections; left leg, right leg, trunk, left arm, and right arm, measuring impedance by a tetrapolar 8-point tac-tile electrode at 50 kHz.Maximal isometric strength of three muscle groups involved in prime movements, including grip strength, ankle dorsiflexion, and plantarflexion were tested using hand-held dyna-mometry by a trained clinical evaluator (Citec; CIT Tehcnics, Harren,the Netherlands).
To meet the independence requirements for statisti- cal analysis, the measurements from only the dominant limb were included for each participant, and this was kept consistent for everystudy visit (Menz, 2004). Three repetitions were performed per mus- cle group, and an average measurement of strength was determined from this.Gait was assessed by heel and toe walking, which wasscored on a 3-point scale of difficulty: “no,”“some, ”and “yes”to fur- ther examine dorsiflexion and plantarflexion strength.Power was measured by a standing long jump on a padded mat.Fine motorendurance was evaluated by the Handwriting Speed Test (Wallen et al., 1996) that gives a raw score in letters per minute, and gross motor endurance by the 6MWT, which was completed barefoot on apoint-to-point, 25-m long, flat, straight, hard surfaced track.
Quality oflife was assessed by parent reported questionnaires, including the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL ™) Generic 4.0 and Neuromuscular (3.0) modules, and The Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6 –18 or CBCL/6-18 (©ASEBA 2020). The PedsQL ™Generic 4.0 module con- sists of physical, psychosocial, and total summary scores, and the2978 VASILJEVSKI ET AL.PedsQL ™Neuromuscular 3.0 module consists of neuromuscular dis- ease, communication, family resources, and neuromuscular total sum-mary scores.Both are scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating worse health.The CBCL/6-18 (©ASEBA 2020) consists of 113 questions, scored on a 3-point Likert scale(0=absent, 1 =occurs sometimes, 2 =occurs often) that tests for empirically based syndrome scales.To fall within the clinical range of a syndrome scale means that the parent-reported results from thatquestionnaire indicate their child clinically manifest the syndrome.
2.4 |Statistical analysis We analyzed the treatment effect by calculating average % change from baseline compared to 12-weeks posttreatment for all outcomemeasures for each participant ( n=6), and confidence intervals for improvement were also calculated. Spearman's rank-order correlation efficiency was applied to determine a weight specific dosage effect.Participant functional assessments from baseline and 12-weeks post- treatment were compared to reference data to generate Z-score changes (negative Z-score is indicative of motor impairment based onage and sex-matched normative data).Hand-dynamometry strength measures, long jump, and 6MWT were compared to reference data obtained from the 1000 Norms Project, an observational study inves-tigating outcome measures of self-reported health and physical func-tion in 1000 healthy individuals aged 3 to 101 years (McKay et al., 2016).Handwriting speed was compared to normative data adapted from Cermak (1989) and Wechsler (1974).
Height, weight,and body mass index (BMI) Z-scores were generated using USCDC2000 reference data. 2.5 |Role of the funding source This study was funded by the Children's Tumor Foundation (US).The funding source had no involvement in the following: study design, col- lection, analysis, and interpretation of data, in the writing of the report, and in the decision to submit the paper for publication.3|RESULTS Between June and August 2019, a total of six participants were rec- ruited at the Neurogenetics/Neuromuscular clinic located in The Chil- dren's Hospital at Westmead.All participants fulfilled clinicaldiagnostic criteria for NF1, a medical history of muscle weakness and physical fatigue and were naïve to L-carnitine supplementation.Demographics and clinical characteristics for the six participants aresummarized in Table 1.Four (67.7%) were male and two (33.3%) were female.The mean age was 10.7 years ( SD1.2), and BMI Z-score was /C00.32.
All participants were assigned the predetermined daily dose of 1000 mg levocarnitine tartrate ( n=6). The mean calculated daily weight-specific dose was 31.6 mg/kg/day ( SD10.5), based on weight measurements collected at baseline.All participants completed the predetermined treatment duration of 12 weeks.All bottles ofL-carnitine supplements were return ed at the completion of the study.There were no side effects or adverse events reported through- out the duration of this study.Kidney and liver function were normal,and there were no clinically significant changes in circulating fats fol- lowing 12 weeks of L-carnitine supplementation.There were no with- drawals, and all participants completed ≥84% of the treatment course (calculated as a percentage; number of capsules taken/168*100), with a mean compliance of 95 ± 6.2%.Therefore, 1000 mg/daily levocarnitine tartrate treatment was deemed safe and feasible.
Acylcarnitine profiling revealed no abnormalities in plasma acylcarnitine levels (Table 2). Mean baseline levels of acylcarnitines included total carnitine 39.3 (Ref: 5 –106, SD9.2), free carnitine 31.8 (Ref: 3 –60, SD9.6), acetyl-carnitine 6 (Ref: 2 –39, SD1.5), pro- pionylcarnitine 0.4 (Ref: 0.12 –0.97, SD0.2), and isovalerylcarnitine 0.1 (Ref: 0.00 –0.22, SD0.1).Following 12 weeks of L-carnitine supple- mentation, levels of acylcarnitines were total carnitine 54.5 (Ref: 5 – 106, SD6.8), free carnitine 44.5 (Ref: 3 –60,SD5.6), acetyl-carnitine 8.3 (Ref: 2 –39,SD1.8), propionylcarnitine 0.7 (Ref: 0.12 –0.97, SD 0.3), and isovalerylcarnitine 0.2 (Ref: 0.00 –0.22, SD0.1).Bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed to assess the effect of L-carnitine supplementation on body fat mass (kg) or amount (% body weight), due to its primary role in fat metabolism.
There was a mean reduction in fat mass by 0.8% ( SD4.5, p=0.76), and mean TABLE 1 Baseline characteristics of participants Participant number (#) 1 2 3 4 5 6 Mean ( SD) Gender Male Female Male Male Female Male NA Age (year) 11 10 9 12 12 10 10.7 (1.2) Height (cm) 135.0 150.9 127.6 143.8 157.2 123.5 139.7 (12.1)Height Z-score /C01.38 1.23 /C01.24 /C00.75 0.35 /C02.43 /C00.7 (1.2) Weight (kg) 28.8 42.8 21.5 35.2 56.5 25.8 35.1 (11.8)Weight Z-score /C01.45 0.81 /C02.34 /C00.80 1.14 /C01.44 /C00.7 (1.3) BMI Z-score /C00.80 0.54 /C02.54 /C00.39 1.19 0.11 /C00.3 (1.2) Calculated dose (mg/kg/day) 34.7 23.4 46.5 28.4 17.7 38.8 31.6 (10.5)Treatment duration (weeks) 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 (0)VASILJEVSKI ET AL. 2979 reduction in fat amount by 2.8% ( SD4.4,p=0.21), neither statistically significant (Figure 1a).The average BMI Z-score decreased from/C00.32 at baseline to /C00.41 at 12-weeks posttreatment.
Following 12 weeks of L-carnitine supplementation, there was no significant improvement in grip strength (95% CI /C02.49 to 10.15; p=0.18); however, there was a mean 53% increase in dorsiflexion strength (95% CI 8.89 –60.75; p=0.02) and a mean 66% increase in plantarflexion strength (95% CI 12.99 –134.1; p=0.03) (Figure 1b). Standing long jump distance was significantly greater on average by 10% after the 12-week treatment course (95% CI 2.97 –16.03; p=0.01) (Figure 1c).A mean 10% improvement was also observed for the 6MWT after 12-weeks of L-carnitine supplementation (95% CI5.88–75.45; p=0.03).To note, the 6MWT of participant two was excluded due to cramping during testing time.Furthermore, handwrit- ing speed was increased by 15% on average; however, due to the con-siderable variability in participant performance, this failed to reach statistical significance (95% CI /C07.38 to 20.24; p=0.28) (Figure 1c).
Functional outcome measures collected throughout the study were compared to age and sex matched normative data. NF1 partici- pants performed below average on every outcome measure at base- line, with the exception of participant six who generated a positiveZ-score for dorsiflexion strength and handwriting speed, and partici- pants three and four who also had a positive Z-score for handwriting speed (Figure 2).After 12 weeks of L-carnitine supplementation, therewas an average Z-score improvement of dorsiflexion strength from/C01.57 to /C00.32 (95% CI 0.17 –2.33; p=0.03) and plantarflexion strength from /C01.98 to /C00.15 (95% CI 0.08 –3.59; p=0.04).Long jump Z-score improved from /C02.05 to /C01.5 (95% CI 0.15 –0.95; p=0.02), and 6MWT from /C03.2 to /C02.38 (95% CI 0.34 –1.3; p=0.01) (Figure 2; Supporting Table 4).
Comparison of PedsQL ™scores between baseline and 12-weeks posttreatment showed a trend toward improvement on the physical health summary domain of the generic module (median 46.9, inter- quartile range [IQR] 42.2 –60.9 to median 71.9, IQR 51.6 –87.5) (Figure 3; Supporting Table 5). Due to varied parent perception whenscoring their child, there was large variability in the starting scores resulting in statistical significance being unattainable for this outcome measure.Other domains, including psychosocial health summary, neu-romuscular disease summary, communication summary, and family resources summary scores showed no significant differences suggesting that L-carnitine supplementation does not interfere withparticipant's quality of life.
Participants were scored to the CBCL/6-18 empirically based syndrome scales, including anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed,somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, and aggressive behavior at baseline and 12-weeks posttreatment. Majority of the children (4/6) fell withinthe clinical range of >2 syndrome scales at baseline.This was reducedto 2/6 children following 12-weeks posttreatment (Supporting Table 6).However, no statistically significant differences could be detected due to sample size and interparticipant variability (Figure 4).All participants were followed up 3 months after completion of the trial.Three families continued supplementation with L-carnitine.TABLE 2 Acylcarnitine profile test results were all within reference range.

Two families did not continue treatment, withboth families recognizing that NF1 cognitive and social behaviors were confounding their view of L-carnitine supplementation for their child's muscle weakness and fatigue, and one family awaiting the pub-lished trial results to reconsider L-carnitine. 4|DISCUSSION The primary goal of this Phase 2a, proof-of-concept clinical trial was to establish the safety and feasibility of L-carnitine as a therapeuticintervention for NF1 muscle weakness and physical fatigue.Critically, there were no side effects of L-carnitine supplementation or adverse events reported and no abnormalities seen in liver and kidney func-tion tests.These data are consistent with L-carnitine being well toler- ated in both children and adolescents, as it is part of a normal diet (albeit in lower amounts).
The safety of L-carnitine supplementationhas previously been demonstrated in a number of different pediatric cohorts, including primary carnitine deficiency, autism spectrum disor- der (ASD), and Rett syndrome (Ellaway et al., 1999; Geier et al., 2011;Kilic et al., 2012). However, this represents its first trial in a pediatric NF1 population.The high compliance rate of 95%, with no with- drawals suggesting that daily L-carnitine supplementation is a well-received therapeutic approach to treat muscle weakness and fatiguein NF1 children.A daily dose of 1000 mg was predetermined for all participants.Future studies could better control for weight-specific dose, whichvaried from 17.7 to 46.5 mg/kg/day in our cohort.Correlation analysis revealed no association between dose and functional outcomes, although this analysis had limited power.
In prior pediatric studies, a50 mg/kg/day dose of L-carnitine supplementation is commonly prac- ticed with high safety and proven efficacy and this likely represents asuitable starting dose for those naïve to the therapy. Anecdotal reports and clinical studies suggest that dose escalation could merelyincrease the incidence and severity of side effects, such as nausea and vomiting (Geier et al., 2011; Goin-Kochel et al., 2019).There were clinical concerns that kidney or liver function had the potential to beparticularly affected in NF1 children as these organs are sensitive to metabolic changes; however, no evidence for this was seen.The use of L-carnitine in NF1 children with muscle weakness who suffer from seizures remains a question for future study.Such individ- uals were excluded from recruitment due to contraindications with L-carnitine, although these risks are poorly substantiated.
A review ofencephalopathy patients on valproic acid found no data suggestingthat seizures were worsened by L-carnitine supplementation (Zeiler et al., 2016). Therefore, future studies may include removing this as an exclusion criterion.It has been suggested that NF1 could benefit from being described as a lipid-storage metabolic myopathy (11).This concept is supported by the potential efficacy of L-carnitine seen in this trial.The efficacy of L-carnitine supplementation has already been demon- strated in some secondary mitochondrial disorders (Ellaway et al., 1999; Malaguarnera & Cauli, 2019; Zhang et al., 2010).This cat-egory of conditions includes spinal muscular atrophy (Harpey et al., 1990), Parkinson's disease (Park et al., 2018), Rett syndrome (Shulyakova et al., 2017), and ASD (Siddiqui et al., 2016).
Furthermechanistic studies and mitochondrial function analysis may revealthat NF1 has features of a secondary mitochondrial disorder, although it will be important to rule out a primary mitochondrial disease) in cases of NF1 by gene panel testing of oxidative phosphorylation-related genes. It was speculated that individuals enrolled in the study may show clinical deficiency in carnitine that could explain their muscle weak-ness and/or fatigue.While plasma acylcarnitine profiling revealed no clinical deficiency, many individuals were toward the lower end of the FIGURE 1 Percentage change following 12 weeks of L-carnitinesupplementation.Percentage changefrom baseline group mean in (a) bodyfat, (b) strength measures, and(c) other functional outcomes,including long jump, 6 minute walktest (MWT), and handwriting speedtest.

Data presented as group mean +SD.p-Values were assessed by paired Ttest of baseline values and 12-weeks posttreatment values.*p< 0.03.Each symbol denotes participants 1 –6VASILJEVSKI ET AL.2981 normal range.Comparison to a control cohort would be necessary to assess a secondary carnitine deficiency in NF1 children.More impor-tantly, plasma carnitine concentrations do not always reflect the carni-tine concentration observed in skeletal muscle.For example, hemodialysis patients frequently exhibit normal plasma carnitine, but have a low muscle carnitine concentration (Moorthy et al., 1983;Savica et al., 1983).However, muscle biopsies are highly invasive and would represent a major barrier to trial recruitment.Our study has several limitations.
Children with NF1 and muscle weakness and fatigue are a poorly defined subcohort yet representthe precise group that would be most engaged with finding a muscle-targeted therapy. Thus, while this trial design did not use a random- ized or placebo-controlled design, it captures a stratification of the NF1 community most likely to adopt routine L-carnitine supplementa-tion.Moreover, this limitation was balanced by comparing individual cases before and after therapy, and to a normative group from the FIGURE 2 Z-score analysis of patient outcome measures comparedat baseline and 12-weeksposttreatment to age and gendermatched normative data.Z-score comparison of (a) grip strength,(b) dorsiflexion strength,(c) plantarflexion strength, (d) longjump, (e) 6 minute walk (MWT), and (f) handwriting speed.(a –d, f) N=6 NF1 children, (e) N=5 NF1 children.Z-score calculated by sample value – normative (age and gender matched)mean/ SD.

As previously noted, the lack of an L-carnitine dose normalized to weight is another limitation, but one that was necessary within the practicalities of commercially available carnitine preparations. Indeed, this has proved advantageous to fami-lies looking to sustain their supplement use after the study endpoint.Finally, from the initial conception this study aimed to examine safety and compliance within a small cohort and was not designed to completely accommodate the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneityof children with NF1 and was not powered toward functional out- comes.Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish whether function improvement is an effect of the treatment, a placebo effect or theeffect of a natural history.Further, sex-specific effects/caveats of L-carnitine supplementation may be a consideration.Hence, it was always anticipated that this would represent a precursor to a largermulticenter trial.
In summary, our data demonstrate that 1000 mg daily levocarnitine tartrate is safe and feasible in children withNF1-associated muscle weakness and fatigue. Efficacy data suggestpossible improvements in muscle strength and energy levels.How- ever, we propose that a multisite, randomized, double-blind placebo- controlled trial with a consistent dosage regimen of 50 mg/kg/daywould be the optimal approach to firmly establish the efficacy of L-carnitine supplementation.A greater childhood age range, whichcould be compared to age-, sex-, height-, and weight-matched con- trols, would also improve future study data.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to acknowledge the Sydney Children's Hospital Net-work (SCHN) Statistician, Ms.Liz Barnes for her support in statistical design and analysis.
