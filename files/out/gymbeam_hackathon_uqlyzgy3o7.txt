This investigation aimed to fabricate a new nanocomposite scaffold using a 3D printing technique composed of poly( ε- caprolactone) (PCL)/Gelatin (GEL)/ordered mesoporous calcium-magnesium silicate (om-CMS) particles. Different weight ratios of om-CMS were added and optimized, and a series of scaffolds were constructed for comparison purposes, including PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL 50%/Gel 45%/om-CMS%5, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS%10.The optimized weight ratio ofom-CMS was 10% without leaving behind negative effects on the ﬁlaments ’structure.The scaffolds ’physical and chemical properties were assessed using various techniques, and their degradation rate, bioactivity potential, cell viability, attachment, and ALP activity were evaluated in vitro.The results demonstrated that the PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS10% scaffold hadpromising potential for further studies in bone tissue regeneration.

These issues not only have a detrimental impact on the well-being of patientsbut also impose signi ﬁcantﬁnancial burdens on healthcare systems and individuals.
Consequently, it is imperative to perpetuate research and development endeavors aimed atdevising ef ﬁcacious preventive measures and treatments to tackle this predicament [ 1–4]. Although bone tissue pos- sesses the inherent capability to undergo self-regeneration inminor defects, the restoration of bone defects of critical dimensions represents an arduous and intricate process necessitating therapeutic intervention.A prominent strategyemployed in bone defect management involves the utiliza- tion of bone grafting, which serves to induce bone growth and facilitate the healing process [ 1,5,6].The primary techniques utili zed in bone transplantation include autograft, allograft, and xenograft, all of which possess distinct disadvantages such as the potential for infection, long-lasting discomfort, transmission of diseases, high costs, limited availability of donors, activation of the immune response, and the formation of a ﬁbrous capsule [ 5,7,8].
Considering the situations outlined, patients m ust be provided with alternative methods that are better suited to their needs and minimize the occurrence of adverse effects [ 9]. Recently, bone tissue engi- neering has been mentioned as a promising alternative to bone grafting in the treatment of critical bone injuries [ 10].Bone tissue engineering means the u se of biomaterials, cells, and growth factors to facilitate regeneration of damaged bone tissue [11].For this purpose, the ideal scaffold should have the ability to imitate the structure of healthy bone tissue; Also, the by-products resulting from its degradation must not lead to toxi- city, which is achieved due to the biocompatibility of the scaffold.Bioactivity is also one of the other characteristics of bone tissue engineering scaffolds on which newly formed carbonated hydroxyapatite gets precipitated and makes a strong bond with the host bone.
Desirable mechanical properties areother essential factor when it comes to the implantation of a bone scaffold speci ﬁcally for load-bearing applications [ 12]. Theﬁeld of tissue engineering incorporates principles derived from both engineering and life sciences to mimic the functions of tissue and the matrix that are crucial for cell attachment, growth, and differentiation.When designing an ideal scaffoldfor the replacement of hard tissue, it is important to take into account factors such as bioactivity, mechanical stability, and optimal porosity, along with a s uitable rate of degradation to facilitate the regeneration of new bone tissue [ 13,14].Various techniques exist for the fabrica tion of porous bone scaffolds, including solvent casting/particle leaching, gas foaming, freezedrying, thermally induced phase separation, and electrospin- ning [ 2,15–17].
In recent years, the production of 3D scaffoldshas shown promising potential for achieving scaffolds that closely resemble bone tissue [ 18]. Among the range of man- ufacturing processes available, 3D printing stands out as a unique and ef ﬁcient method of prototyping that was initially developed in the early 1990s by Sacks and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) [ 1,19].3D printing is an additive manufacturing technique that involves the layer-by-layer deposition of materials in different shapes to create a desired output.This process leads to thedevelopment of a porous scaffold with precisely engineered shapes and interconnected pores [ 20,21].Among the various methods of additive manufacturing, Liquid Deposition Mod-eling (LDM) is a widely used technique that operates at low temperatures and produces high-quality prototypes with a smooth surface.
LDM is additionally more cost-effective andfaster in comparison to other techniques, thus making it a desirable choice for industries in various sectors [ 22,23]. The choice of biomaterials is a crucial aspect in the pro- duction of 3D scaffolds used for the regeneration and sub- stitution of human tissues and organs [ 24].A diverse range of natural and synthetic polymers are being utilized for thefabrication of 3D printing scaffolds [ 25] .O n es h o u l dk e e pi n mind that utilizing a natural or synthetic polymer alone is insufﬁcient to ful ﬁll the crucial criteria for bone tissue regeneration, such as appropriate degradation that aligns with bone reconstruction.However, by combining both types of polymers as a composite, it becomes possible to achieve mostof the necessary features to mimic the extracellular matrix [26].Numerous polymers are currently being investigated as potential materials for manufacturing tissue engineeringscaffolds.
These include both natural and synthetic polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), polyurethane, as well as poly( ε- caprolactone) (PCL), poly3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB), PCL- co-PEG, Gelatin (Gel), and silk ﬁbroin, which are widely used for tissue engineering applications [ 27]. PCL is a synthetic polymer that is commonly used in biomedical applications due to its biocompatibility, biode- gradability, and high strength.One of its noteworthy prop-erties is its ability to maintain its physical and mechanical properties over an extended period of time.However, when it comes to bone tissue regeneration, PCL ’s limited interaction with the surrounding environment is a weakness that results in low cell adhesion, weak bioactivity, and slow degradation One strategy to mitigate the limitations associated with PCL isto combine it with a natural polymer, such as Gel.
Gel is a biocompatible natural polymer that is sourced from collagen and exhibits a high rate of degradation [ 11,28,29]. In response to the challenges associated with the low Young ’s modulus and weak bioactivity of polymers, numerous studies have investigated the combined use of polymers and bioactiveinorganic materials.This approach holds promise for enhan- cing the mechanical and biological properties of polymer- 58 Page 2 of 18 Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine (2024) 35:58 based materials for various biomedical applications [ 9,16].Research has indicated that silicon may have a signi ﬁcant role to play in the initial stages of bone calci ﬁcation when it is paired with calcium.As a result, there has been a lot of interest in developing various types of biomaterials that contain Ca-Si, such as bioactive glasses, A/W glass ceramics,wollastonite, and calcium silicate.
In recent times, magnesium-based biomaterials have also gained attention as potential materials for repairing bones [ 30]. There has been development in mesoporous bioactive materials with ordered mesopore channel structure and a mesopore size ranging from 2 to 50 nm, using a template technique.Examples of thesematerials include mesoporous silicate, mesoporous bioactive glass, and mesoporous calcium silicate [ 31–33].An important characteristic of mesoporous bioactive materials is theirimproved surface area and pore volume, which contribute to their superior bioactivity [ 34–36].A pioneering study has performed a series of in vitro studies over ordered mesopor-ous calcium magnesium silicate (om-CMS).
They synthesized om-CMS and the same compound but without mesoporosity and compared the bioactivity rate; the rate for the mesoporousone was competitively higher than that of the counterpart thanks to the mesoporous structure which can accelerate the ions exchange between the surface and the surroundingenvironment. The cell-related studies against MC3T3-E1 cells revealed that the om-CMS supported cell attachment, pro- liferation, and differentiation in vitro [ 37].The same group then reported on the development of a composite consists of poly(l-lactide) and om-CMS through the melt bending method.The addition of om-CMS to the polymer led to asigniﬁcant improvement in the composite ’s hydrophilicity, degradation rate, and bioactivity in vitro.Also, the om-CMS could neutralize the acidity caused through the liberation ofpolymer ’s by-products which increased the cell viability [ 38].
This study has fabricated a new functional biocomposite scaffold composed of om-CMS and PCL/Gel for bone tis-sue regeneration (Scheme 1). In this regard, it examined how the incorporation of om-CMS affected the hydro- philicity, in vitro degradation, bioactivity, and cellularresponse of polymer-based composites.Combining om- CMS with PCL/Gel was expected to yield a biocomposite with better physical, chemical, and biological characteristicscompared to PCL/Gel alone.2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials For synthesis of om-CMS, some raw materials such as P123(EO20PO70EO20, Mw: 5800 kDa), magnesium nitrate hex-ahydrate (Mg (NO 3)2.6H 2O), calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca (NO 3)2.4H 2O), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98% pure),Hydrochloric acid (HCL, 2.0 M) purchased from Merck, Ger- many.
Polycaprolactone (PCL; Mw: 80,000 kDa, Sigma- Aldrich, USA), Gelatin (Gel; derived from bovine skin and classiﬁed as type B, Merck, Germany), chloroform (Sigma- Aldrich, USA), trypsin-EDTA (0.25% trypsin 0.04 mM EDTA, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 3-(4 ,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromi de (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI solu- tion), glutaraldehyde (25% aqueous solution, Merck, Ger-many), DMEM and glutamax (low glucose, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMS O, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), fetal bovine serum (FBS, Bioidea, Iran), alkaline phosphatase kit(ALP, Pars Azmun, Iran), MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line (Pasteur Institute, Iran), Dulbecco ’s modi ﬁed eagle ’sm e d i u m (DMEM, Fisher Scienti ﬁc, India), parafor maldehyde (Sigma- Aldrich, USA), ethanol (Sigma-A ldrich, USA), distilled water (Sky company, Iran), and simulated body ﬂuid (SBF, Bioidea, Iran) are other materials that were utilized in this study.
2.2 Preparation of om-CM In this research, the sol-gel method was applied to synthe- size and prepare the om-CMS. First, 12 g of P123 was dissolved in 360 mL of HCL (2.0 M) and 90 mL of distilledwater for 2 h on a magnetic stirrer at 60 °C.Next, 27.63 mL of TEOS was slowly added drop by drop to the previous solution.The mixture was placed on a magnetic stirrer for30 min until the hydrolysis of TEOS was almost complete.After that, 14.4 g of magnesium nitrate hexahydrate and 15.6 g of calcium nitrate tetrahydrate were added one afteranother to the previous solution.The obtained solution was stirred at 60 °C and kept for 5 h.Then it is placed at 50 °C for 24 h to turn into a gel.The ﬁnal gel was dried in an oven at 50 °C for 24 h followed by being heat-treated at 600 °C for 6 h at a rate of 3 °C min −1to calcinate.The heat treat- ment leads to the removal of P123 which had been formedas a template throughout the ceramic structure leaving behind an ordered mesoporous structure [ 37].
2.3 Scaffolds fabrication The PCL pellets were dissolved in chloroform at 45 °C to prepare a 50% w/v polymeric viscous solution. The solution turned into a clear solution after one hour.Dry gelatin powder was subsequently added as the binder phase to thesolution with 40, 45 and 50% w/w relative to PCL dry mass under continuous stirring.The scaffold with a ratio of PCL 50%/Gel 40% w/w was identi ﬁed as the most optimal scaffold.Additionally, two different concentrations of om- CMS, namely 5 and 10% w/w, were incorporated into the PCL/Gel solution to create the 3D printing ink.Theexamination of three scaffolds such as PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine (2024) 35:58 Page 3 of 18 58 om-CMS 10%, namely A, B, and C, respectively, are included in this discussion.3D scaffolds were manufactured using a 3-axis Extrusion-Based 3D printer with a single- screw micro-extruder (Abtin II, Abtin Teb Co.Iran).
Theprinting geometry, a 2 ×2 × 1 cm cubic-shaped block. The intermediary ﬁlaments spacing was set at 500 μm, and the graphical model that was used to print the scaffolds wasdesigned using the Solidworks program (Version 2017, Dassault Systèmes, France) and printed using the Repetier software interface.The printing parameters include anextrusion rate at the constant speed (5 μm sec −1), a printing speed of 3 mm s−1, a nuzzle diameter of 0.51 μm, and a layer height of 0.3 mm.Finally, the scaffolds were subjectedto vacuum drying at room temperature for 7 days.2.4 Characterization 2.4.1 Characterization of om-CMS The om-CMS was characterized using a transmission electron microscope (TEM; EM208s, Philips, Netherlands) to observemesoporous and microstructure structure and particle dis- tribution.
Scanning electron microscope (SEM; FEI Quanta 200, England) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS; KYKY/EM-8000, China) was adopted to investigate mor-phological properties and elementary composition. Low angle x-ray diffraction (LAXRD; Bruker D8ADVANCE, Germany) was used to characterize the phase composition of om-CMS,om-CMS crystallinity, and the order of mesoporous structure.To determine the chemical composition of the substances, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Bruker, Tensor 27,Germany) was adopted within the range of 400 –4000 cm −1.N2 adsorption-desorption was used to determine the textural p r o p e r t i e so fo m - C M S ;B r u n a u e r –Emmett –Teller (BET) is utilized to evaluate the speci ﬁc surface area of a given material.To calculate pore size distributions, pore area, and volume of mesopore structure, Barrett –Joyner –Halenda (BJH) methods was conducted.
Furthermore, Nitrogen adsorption- desorption isotherms were investigated on a Micromeritics porosimeter (BELSORP Mini 2, Japan) at 77 K under con-tinuous adsorption conditions to determine the type of isotherm.

In this me thod, sharp peaks represent crystalline regions; others dem onstrate amorphous regions. To determine the functional groups in all specimens, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy-Attenuated total reﬂectance (FTIR-ATR, Bruker, Tensor 27, Germany) was utilized.To achieve this objective, a printing ink was pre-pared for each group, and subsequently, a thin ﬁlm was fabricated from the ink.This evaluation was conducted in room temperature and 400 –4000 cm −1range.To examine the morphology, elemental analysis, and microstructure of the scaffolds including the pore size and theﬁlament diameter, scanning electron microscopy (SEM; FEI Quanta 200, England) equipped with EDS was applied.The drop shape method (contact angle meter XCA-50) was applied to determine the Hydrophilicity of PCL 50%/Gel 50%,PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/ om-CMS 10% scaffolds.
Thin layer ﬁlms were prepared from each type of scaffold and then, a drop in a volume of 4 μLo f distilled water was used. A CCD camera and software were applied to determine the droplet contact angle with the surface.Mechanical properties of PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL 50%/ Gel 40%/om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffolds were assessed according to ASTM D695-19 standard.For this purpose, the scaffolds were cut carefully(5 mm diameter) and the test was accomplished by using HOUNSFIELD/H25KS with 500 N.load cell, speed 2 mm min −1, and 60% strain rate.Finally, the compressive strength and Young ’s modulus were measured.2.4.3 In vitro biodegradationF1635-11 ASTM standard was utilized to evaluate the degradation rate and the weight loss of PCL 50%/Gel 50%,PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/ om-CMS 10% scaffolds.In this regard, the samples were cut with a diameter of 5 mm with skin punch and the initialweight of each sample was measured before soaking.
In the next step, they were immersed in 10 mL PBS (pH =7.4) for 100 days. Then, all samples incubated in an incubator withconditions of 37 °C, humidity of 95%, and 5% of CO 2.I n the days of 1, 3, 5, and 7 and followed by every week to 14 weeks, the samples were removed from PBS and rinsedtwice.In the following, they were dried using vacuum conditions at 37 °C.In the last step, using by 5 decimal place scale (Sartorius, Model Practum 224-1S, Germany),the dried weight of each sample was measured.This process was repeated until the 14th week.The weight of dried scaffolds was measured ( W t)a n d ﬁnally, the percentage of weight loss was calculated from the Eq.( 1).Weight loss %¼W0/C0Wt ðÞ W0/C2100 ð1Þ Where, W0is the initial weight of scaffolds (before immersion in PBS), Wtis the dried scaffolds ’weight after being immersed into PBS.
2.4.4 In vitro bioactivity Hydroxyapatite formation capacity of a material is one of the early studies determining the interaction of a biomaterial with the surrounding biological medium; if the biomaterialcould form newly formed carbonated calcium phosphate on itself, it is possible that this biomaterial can make a direct bonding with the host bone in real conditions [ 39–41]. The bioactivity assessment was conducted following the ISO 10993-18 standard.The scaffolds were cut to a size of 5 mm and then immersed in 10 mL of SBF for up to 28 days at atemperature of 37 °C.At speci ﬁc time intervals, the scaf- folds were removed, rinsed, and subsequently dried in a vacuum oven at a temperature of 37 °C.The morphology ofscaffolds was assessed at each time interval to observe if newly formed precipitation is generated on the scaffolds.
Moreover, the concentration of calcium and phosphorus ions was measured during the soaking period through an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). For the aforementioned objective, the samples wereextracted from the SBF and the solution was subsequently analyzed through the ICP.2.4.5 Cell assays 2.4.5.1 MTT assays In this investigation, the MTT assay was employed to assess the viability of cell scaffolds for up to 7 days, following the ISO-10993-5 standard.A DMEMmedium containing MG-63 cells, 10% FBS, and 1% peni- cillin/streptomycin was prepared and maintained in a con- trolled environment with a humidity level and temperatureof 5% CO 2and 37 °C, respectively.Once the cells reached full coverage, they were rinsed with PBS and detached from the plate using Trypsin-EDTA (0.25% Trypsin in 0.04 mMEDTA).Prior to the initiation of cell culture, all scaffolds were subjected to sterilization under UV light for a duration of 40 min and subsequently placed on 24-well plates.
Thecells were then seeded onto the scaffolds at a density of 6×1 0 3and incubated in a controlled environment with a humidity level and temperature of 5% CO 2and 37 °C, respectively. Following a speci ﬁc time interval, the cell culture medium was replaced and supplemented with 400μL of serum-free DMEM and 40 μL of MTT solution (5 mg mL−1) in each well.Upon removal of the MTTJournal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine (2024) 35:58 Page 5 of 18 58 solution, 200 μL of DMSO solution was introduced to dis- solve the formazan crystals.Lastly, the optical density of each solution was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm using a microplate reader (680, Bio-Rad, Hercules, California).2.4.5.2 Cell attachment The attachment and growth of MG-63 cells (6 × 103cells cm−2) on the PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel40%/om-CMS 10% scaffolds were assessed through in vitro culture for 7 days.
At each time point, the scaffolds underwent three rinses with PBS, and the cells were thenﬁxed with 3% glutaraldehyde for an hour at 4 °C. Subse- quently, the scaffolds were subjected to dehydration pro- cess using ethanol solutions with increasing concentrations—50, 70, 80, 90, and 100 wt.%.Each scaffold was sub- merged in each ethanol solution for 30 min at a temperature of 4 °C.Following this, the scaffolds were air-dried over-night, and the SEM was utilized to analyze the surface of the scaffolds.2.4.5.3 Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) The ALP activity of PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om- CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffoldswas assessed over 21 days through the implementation of the ALP assay.This particular assay involves the utilization of an enzyme that effectively separates the phosphatasegroups from p-nitrophenyl phosphate, subsequently con- verting it into p-nitrophenol (PNP).
The quanti ﬁcation of the yellow-colored compound exhibited by PNP serves as ameans to gauge the ALP activity [ 42]. 2.4.5.4 DAPI staining To con ﬁrm the existence of living cells on the scaffolds within a 7-day timeframe in an artiﬁcial environment, the DAPI staining technique was employed.Following the culturing of cells on the scaf-folds, the cells were subjected to ﬁxation using a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min.Subsequently, the cells were rinsed with PBS and permeabilized by treat-ment with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min.The scaffolds were then subjected to another round of rinsing with PBS and stained with a concentration of 0.1 μg/mL of DAPI for 5 min.Ultimately, the ﬂuorescent image analyzer, speci ﬁcally the Olympus DP72 instrument, Japan, was employed to capture ﬂuorescent images from the surface of the scaffolds.
2.4.6 Statistical analysisThe quantitative data is presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) and was analyzed using Origin and Graph-Pad software. The level of statistical signi ﬁcance was set at **P≤0.05.3 Results and discussions 3.1 Characterization of om-CMS The low-angle XRD pattern of the om-CMS powder is pre- sented in Fig.1A.The analysis indicated that this powder has a diffraction peak in re ﬂection (100), which is associated with 2D hexagonal symmetry, a characteristic that is typically observed in mesoporous samples with high domain order[37,43].Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was adopted to examine the shape and composition of the om- CMS powder.The TEM micrograph in Fig.1Br e v e a l e dt h e mesoporous structure of the om-CMS powder.The om-CMS powder has evenly spaced mesopores with a consistent hexagonal shape and a uniform pore size [ 44].The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm (Fig.
1C) indicates that om- CMS exhibits a type IV isotherm according to the IUPAC classi ﬁcation, with H1-type hysteresis loops at high relative pressure [ 37,45]. This suggests the presence of independent cylindrical narrow pore channels arranged parallel and side by side, with a highly uniform pore size distribution.Thegraph shows a sudden increase in initial values, followed by linearization, which re ﬂects the regularity of the powder pores [ 37].The results further indicate that om-CMS has a well-de ﬁned array of regular mesopores, with a very narrow pore size distribution and an average pore size of ~3.09 nm.Additionally, the powder has an average surface area of123.86 m 2/g and a total pore volume of 0.3028 cm3/g.The SEM micrographs in Fig.2A illustrate the mor- phology of om-CMS powder, which appears worm-like inshape.Furthermore, by using the EDS technique (Fig.
2B), the presence of Si, Mg, Ca, and O elements associated with om-CMS was identi ﬁed by observing their respective peaks. The Fig.2C also includes elemental mapping revealing the distribution of these elements within the structure [ 46].3.2 Characterization of 3D printed scaffolds 3.2.1 X-ray diffraction Figure 3displays the XRD pattern of PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL 50%/Gel 45%/om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffolds.The XRD analysis of the PCL revealed speci ﬁc peaks at 2 θangles of 23.5°, 21.2°, and 21.9°, which correspond to the (200), (110), and (111)planes, respectively [ 47].On the other hand, since Gel as a natural polymer has an amorphous structure, adding it to PCL weakens its peaks [ 48].The reduction in peak intensity is indicative of a decrease in PCL crystallinity.In groups A to C, due to the closeness of the percentage of Gel, there was no signi ﬁcant difference in the peaks.
According to past studies, in the XRD of om-CMS powder, there is a broad peak that is around 2 θ=25°, which represents the usual 58 Page 6 of 18 Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine (2024) 35:58 structure of amorphous silicate and it shows the non- crystalline and amorphous phase of om-CMS [ 37]. It can be said that increasing in the amount of om-CMS powder inthe scaffolds leads to the weakening of the PCL index peaks.3.2.2 Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy Chemical bonding of PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL 50%/Gel 45%/ om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffolds was assessed through FTIR and indicated in Fig.
4.I nt h eF T I R spectrum of PCL, the peaks at 2943 and 2864 cm −1correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching groups of CH 2,t h e strong peak at 1721 cm−1belongs to the stretching carbonyl group (C =O), 1467 and 1366 cm−1C–H2methyl and methylene bond bending vibrations, 1293 cm−1C–Ca n dC –O stretching vibrations, peaks 1239 and 1159 cm−1, respectively, asymmetric and symmetric C –O–C vibrations, 1043 cm−1 belongs to C –O stretching vibrations and 729 cm−1related to CH2vibrations. The presence of Gel in the scaffolds can be identi ﬁed by observing protein bands at speci ﬁcw a v en u m b e r s .These wave numbers include 3416 cm−1, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of the amide II bond, 1646 cm−1[49],which corresponds to the stretching of the C =O bond, and 1536 cm−1, which corresponds to the bending of NH and stretching of C –N bonds.These wave numbers are associated with amide I and amide II, respectively [ 9,50].
The characteristic peaks of om-CMS powder are at 3444 and 1636 cm−1, which correspond to the stretching and bending vibrations of –OH surface absorption groups, respectively. Moreover, the peaks at 1084 and 804 cm−1are attributed to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of Si –O–Si, respectively [ 51–53].All the characteristic peaks of PCL are well represented in groups A to C.The peak representing C =O stretching vibrations, which is common between PCL and Gel,was shown in groups A to C.The peak at 1084 cm −1repre- sents Si –O–Si vibrations in group B and C are weakly shown.3.2.3 SEM analysis The surface morphology and microstructure of PCL 50%/ Gel 50%, PCL 50%/Gel 45%/om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/ Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffolds was examined through SEM imaging.The SEM results (Fig.5) indicate that the surface of the scaffolds becomes more uneven with an increase in om-CMS content [ 54].The pore size and Fig.

Cell migration is signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced by the regularity andconnectivity of the pores present in a scaffold [ 56].There- fore, scaffolds designed for bone tissue engineering areconsidered appropriate when their porosity is within the range of 300 to 700 µm in terms of pore size [ 57,58].Fig.3 XRD pattern of PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL50%/Gel 45%/om- CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffolds Fig.4 FTIR spectrum of PCL, Gel, om-CMS particle, PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL50%/Gel 45%/om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om- CMS 10% scaffolds Fig.2 ASEM images of om-CMS, BEDS images of om-CMS.
CMap spectrum of om-CMS 58 Page 8 of 18 Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine (2024) 35:58 The presence of pores in the size range of 400 –500 µm offers the advantage of a high surface-to-volume ratio, which facilitates tissue growth and vascularization from the host tissue into the scaffold. In the provided diagram (Fig.5), it can be observed that Group C, which contained 10% om- CMS, resulted in reduced ﬁlament diameter and increased scaffold porosity, which reached the optimal range of 600 µmsuitable for bone tissue engineering.The examination of SEM images through the utilization of ImageJ software demon- strated that the average of ﬁlament diameter within the PCL scaffold measured 417.93 ± 39 µm.Upon the incorporation of 5% wt.om-CMS, the diameter of the ﬁlaments experienced a minor reduction, about 387.45 ± 37 µm, with noteworthysigniﬁcance.
Conversely, upon reaching the 10% threshold of om-CMS within the composite composition, in the PCL 50%/ Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffold, the ﬁlaments diameter underwent a reduction to 368.83 ± 42 µm. The extracted results from SEM images have presented in the Table 1.According to studies, silicate compounds can reduce the diameter of the printed ﬁlament and as a result increase the porosity [ 59].Calcium magnesium silicate can reduce the viscosity of materials, allowing them to ﬂow more easily through a 3D printer nozzle.This improved ﬂow can lead to thinner ﬁlament diameters [ 60].3.2.4 Hydrophilicity In general, Hydrophilicity of a scaffold plays an important role in determining properties such as initial cell adhesion and migration, mechanical properties and scaffold degradation[61].Figure 6shows the contact angle of the water drop with the PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL 50%/Gel 45%/om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffolds.
All of the scaffolds demonstrated a contact angle below 90°, therebyconﬁrming the hydrophilic nature of the scaffolds. The incorporation of an amide group in Gel facilitates the for- mation of hydrogen bonds with water molecules, resulting inthe hydrophilicity of the scaffolds.The hydrophobic proper- ties of PCL diminish upon the incorporation of silicate compounds.In addition to the inherent characteristics of thematerials, the interconnected porous channels also play a signiﬁcant role in determining the Hydrophilicity of the 3D scaffolds [ 59].The increase of om-CMS resulted in contact angles of 74.06, 69.81, and 59.77 degrees for scaffolds from groups A to C (PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL 50%/Gel 45%/om- CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffolds).It is evident that the hydrophilicity of the PCL 50%/Gel 40%/ om-CMS 10% scaffold is signi ﬁcantly greater ( P<0 .0 5 )t h a n Fig.

3.2.5 Mechanical properties3D printed bone tissue engineering scaffolds must have matching mechanical properties to provide suf ﬁcient mechanical support and prevent the stress shield phenomenon [64]. The mechanical properties of the scaffold can affect cell g r o w t ha n dm o r p h o l o g yb yi n ﬂuencing cell adhesion responses.A normal cell not only applies force to the matrix, but also responds to that force through internal organization.This improves adhesion properties and adjusts the skeletalstructure [ 65].Compressive strength is one of the most important characteristics of a suitable scaffold for bone tissue engineering applications.Since the bone in the body is subjectto mechanical loading, especially the bones of the lower limbs, therefore the scaffolds used in bone tissue engineering must have desirable mechanical properties that are propor-tional to the compressive strength and Young ’s modulus of natural bone [ 66].The stress-strain diagram (Fig.
7I) indicates that as the content of om-CMS increases, there is a signi ﬁcant rise in the compressive strength of the scaffolds ( P<0 . 0 5 ) from group A to C, with values of 9.12, 16.8, and 21.02 MPa, respectively.The diagram related to Young ’s modulus (Fig.7II) reveals that the scaffold ’s stiffness also signi ﬁcantly increases ( P< 0.05) from group A to C, with values of 13.89,31.71, and 58.64 MPa, respectively, as the amount of om- CMS increases.The compressive strength of spongy bone typically falls between 0.1 and 30 MPa, indicating that the mechanical properties of the scaffolds in this study are pro- portional to those of cancellous bone [ 67].The uniform dis- persion of these nano ﬁllers in a polymer creates an extremely large interfacial density between the material and the host polymer, which changes the molecular mobility and mechanical properties of the material [ 68].
To increase the mechanical strength of PCL/Gel scaffolds, silicate compounds such as om-CMS were added. According to the study of Patanashti et al.the addition of these silicate-based com-pounds increases the mechanical strength and also increases the Young ’sm o d u l u ss i g n i ﬁcantly, which proves the potential of these compounds for bone tissue regeneration [ 59].3.2.6 In vitro biodegradation One of the fundamental characteristics in the ﬁeld of bone tissue engineering is the degradability of scaffolds.This implies that the rate at which scaffolds are degraded must bedirectly proportional to the rate at which tissue regeneration occurs [ 64].The SEM images of PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL 50%/Gel 45%/om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffolds after a degradation period of 100 days are displayed in Fig.8A.Conversely, a research study has indicated that as the quantity of om-CMS increases over time,the degradation rate decreases [ 24].
Generally, the addition of gelatin to PCL increases the rate of destruction of the scaffold [69 ,70]. The results presented in Fig.8B indicate that all three scaffolds experienced a signi ﬁcant decrease in weight on the initial day of testing, which can be attributed to the release of Gel from the compound and the gradual process ofhydrolysis of the PCL molecules [ 71].Speci ﬁcally, groups A to C have lost 49%, 55%, and 58% of their initial weight, respectively.Subsequently, the scaffolds exhibited a gradualweight decline.Group A demonstrated the lowest level of biodegradability by maintaining about 50% of its initial weight.Scaffolds that contain a high concentration of om-CMS particles demonstrate increase the biodegradability due to the mesoporous structure and increased hydrophilicity [ 72].Nevertheless, by incorporating these particles with otherdegradable materials and optimizing their size and composi- tion, the biodegradability of the scaffold can be enhanced [72–74].
FTIR spectra of the scaffolds after 100 days of immersion in PBS are indicated through Fig. 8C, where it can be seen that no changes in the chemical bonds havee occurred and the structure was remained intact.3.2.7 In vitro bioactivity The evaluation of the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) on the surface of PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL 50%/Gel 45%/om- Fig.6 Contact angle of PCL 50%/Gel 50% ( A), PCL50%/Gel 45%/ om-CMS 5% ( B), and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% ( C) scaf- folds.(** P< 0.005) 58 Page 10 of 18 Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine (2024) 35:58 Fig.7 ICompress strength of PCL 50%/Gel 50% (A), PCL50%/Gel 45%/om-CMS 5% (B), and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% (C) scaffolds.IIYoung modulus of PCL 50%/Gel 50% (A), PCL50%/Gel45%/om-CMS 5% (B), and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% (C) scaffolds.(** P< 0.005) Fig.8 ASEM images of PCL 50%/Gel 50% (i, ii), PCL50%/Gel 45%/ om-CMS 5% (iii, iv), and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% after100 days immersion in PBS (v, vi) scaffolds.

The scaf- folds of PCL 50%/Gel 45%/om-CMS 5% and PCL 50%/ Gel 40%/om-CMS 10%, incorporating om-CMS ceramicsand featuring a more bioactive surface, exhibited hydro- xyapatite deposits in the form of cauli ﬂower-like structures. The EDS spectrum of PCL 50%/Gel 45%/om-CMS 5% andPCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffolds (Fig.9B) demonstrated the presence of silica (Si), calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P) elements within the hydroxyapatite struc-ture.After a period of 28 days, the EDX ﬁndings for all three scaffolds exhibit peaks associated with calcium and phosphorus.The EDX/map suggests an augmentation ofthese elements over time on the sample ’s surface, thus indicating an escalation in the development of calciumphosphate compounds on scaffold surface.Subsequently, the ratio of calcium to phosphorus has experienced anampli ﬁcation and was observed to get close to the stoi- chiometric ratio in hydroxyapatite, namely 1.67.
Conse- quently, these acquired ﬁndings verify the preliminary stages of hydroxyapatite formation, namely the deposition of a calcium phosphate layer on the scaffold ’s surface. In samples that encompass om-CMS, an elongated immersionperiod in SBF leads to the manifestation of om-CMS par- ticles on the surface, intensifying their contact and inter- action with SBF, and bolstering the likelihood of calciumphosphate layer formation.Ceramic particles have the capacity to heighten the absorption of calcium ions from SBF, thereby facilitating the production of hydroxyapatite[75].In addition, the con ﬁrmation of the crystal structure of hydroxyapatite from the scaffolds was achieved throughX-ray examination conducted at the conclusion of both the initial and fourth weeks.In Fig.10A, the XRD ﬁndings serve as evidence of the existence of HA particles, asindicated by the peak at 2 θ=31° [ 73].The presence of the apatite phase is clearly apparent in the scaffolds containing Fig.
9 SEM micrographs, elemental mapping, and EDS analysis of PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL50%/Gel 45%/om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/ om-CMS 10% scaffolds after 28 days immersion in SBF 58 Page 12 of 18 Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine (2024) 35:58 om-CMS after being subjected to immersion in SBF. These observations suggest that om-CMS possesses the capacity to induce the formation of apatite.The concentrations of elements released from the scaf- folds were analyzed using ICP spectroscopy subsequent to immersion in SBF for durations of 7, 21, and 28 days.As depicted in Fig.10B, the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the solution diminished over time, while the amount of magnesium released from the scaffold increased.Within the initial 7-day period, the concentration of calcium andphosphorus ions decreased, indicating that their precipita- tion occurred on the surface of the scaffold.
Subsequently, during the reversibility process, the concentration of theseions increased before once again declining in the solution. The release of Mg ions from the scaffold surface experi- enced an increase during the ﬁrst 7 days, followed by ﬂuctuations during the reversibility process.This process continues until the level attains thermodynamic equilibrium.After a duration of 28 days, it can be observed that thelevels of calcium and phosphorus in PCL 50%/Gel 45%/ om-CMS 5% scaffold have shown an increase, which is not the case for the other two groups.The reason behind thisdiscrepancy lies in the unfavorable surface conditions that hindered the formation of a calcium phosphate layer.Consequently, a signi ﬁcant portion of calcium ions were unable to be absorbed on the surface.Additionally, some calcium ions that were originally present in CMS enteredthe surrounding environment, ultimately resulting in an elevation of calcium concentration in SBF.
3.2.8 Cell-related assays3.2.8.1 Cell viability The MTT assay is employed for the evaluation of cell viability. As illustrated in Fig.11, group A, which consists of PCL 50%/Gel 50%, demonstrated favorable cell viability on the 1th, 3th, and 7th day.How- ever, there was no signi ﬁcant difference ( P< 0.05) in the cell viability when compared to other groups.In of PCL 50%/Gel 45%/om-CMS 5% and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om- CMS 10% scaffolds, there was an observed enhancement incell viability upon the incorporation of om-CMS, as com- pared to group A.This can be attributed to the existence of elements such as calcium, magnesium, and silicon in thebioceramic, which facilitate cell proliferation and differ- entiation [ 37,72,76].These ﬁndings signify that om-CMS does not exert a noticeable detrimental in ﬂuence on the growth of MG-63 cells.3.2.8.2 Cell attachment and DAPI staining In the SEM images presented in Fig.
12, it is evident that MG-63 cells exhibit a tendency to adhere to and grow on the surface of the scaffold. A study conducted by Zhang et al.focused onthe preparation of a composite material consisting of om- CMS and polybutylene succinate (PBSu).The study Fig.10 AXRD pattern of PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL50%/Gel 45%/om- CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffolds after 28 days immersion in SBF.Magni ﬁcations: 300X and 1000X.BCa and Pconcentration of PCL 50%/Gel 50%, PCL50%/Gel 45%/om-CMS 5%, and PCL 50%/Gel 40%/om-CMS 10% scaffolds after 28 days immersion in SBFJournal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine (2024) 35:58 Page 13 of 18 58 investigated the impact of om-CMS on cell adhesion and proliferation.The ﬁndings of the study revealed that the presence of om-CMS in the composite material promotes cell attachment and spreading.The hydrophilic nature of the om-CMS/PBSu composite surface facilitates cell attach- ment, extension, and cytoskeleton organization.
Silanolgroups generated by om-CMS can interact with various functional groups of proteins, creating a favorable surface environment for cell adhesion. Additionally, the calciumand magnesium ions on the surface of om-CMS/PBSu act as ligands, attracting proteins of interest to osteoblasts through positive electrostatic interactions [ 72].Furthermore, DAPI staining was employed to evaluate and identify the adhesion of living cells on the scaffolds under laboratory conditions for a duration of up to 7 days.Examination of the images in Fig.13demonstrates that MG-63 cells adhered well and spread across the different scaffolds.This indicates th at the scaffolds exhibit favorable cellular behavio r and biocompatibility.The presence of calcium magnesium silicate enhanced cell penetration, adhesion, and proliferation, as well aspromoting cell migration and continuous accumulation within the scaffold.
The ability of the scaffold to support cell growth over a 7-day cultivation period wasinvestigated. It is expected that group D would exhibit lower cell adhesion compared to other groups, considering its lower bioactive properties.3.2.8.3 ALP activity The elements included in the compo- sition of om-CMS, including calcium and magnesium, areamong the essential elements in the human body, which are closely related to many biological processes and stimulate osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and bone miner-alization [ 24].Alkaline phosphatase activity can be seen in Fig.14.The phosphatase of nanocomposite scaffolds increased over time for all scaffolds and the scaffold con-taining 10% of om-CMS had higher ALP activity on the 14th day.4 Conclusion The study aimed to fabricate a new composite scaffold forbone tissue regeneration using PCL/GEL/om-CMS particles and 3D printing.
Different amounts of om-CMS were addedto the scaffold to optimize the ratio, and it was found that 10% was the maximum amount that could be added without damaging the ﬁlament ’structure. The results showed that om-CMS particles had hexagonal pores with a size of 3.09 nm.By increasing the amount of om-CMS from 0 to 10%, the diameter of the ﬁlaments decreased from 417.93 ± 39 to 368.83 ± 42 nm and the size of the pores increased from 460.3 ± 79 to 523.47 ± 81 μm, and an improvement in the hydrophilicity and compressive strengthwas observed.Besides physicochemical properties, the ceramic content affected the in vitro biological assessments; a decrease in the rate of degradation was obtained, butbioactivity rate, cell proliferation, and alkaline phosphatase were increased thanks to the om-CMS incorporation.Therefore, this study suggests that the PCL/GEL/om-CMS10% scaffold is a promising option for further studies towards bone tissue regeneration.Fig.
