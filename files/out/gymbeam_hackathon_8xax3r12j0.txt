Email: rkburchell@gmail.comAbstract Background: Vitamin E has a positive effect in the management of osteoarthritis in humans, and in a previous study of dogs. It has been suggested to decrease C-reactive protein concentrations and liver enzyme activities in humans and animals.Objective: To assess the effect of vitamin E supplementation on lameness, pain, pain medication requirement, clinical pathology variables, and quality of life in large-breed dogs with naturally occurring osteoarthritis.Animals: Fifty-seven client-owned dogs with naturally occurring osteoarthritis.Methods: Dogs received either vitamin E or placebo for 90 days in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, prospective clinical trial.Clinical lameness scores, pain medication requirements, and owner questionnaires were used to assess response to treatment every 30 days.Blood samples were collected at enrollmentand at the end of the study period.
Results: Vitamin E administration did not improve pain, lameness, or quality of life as assessed by owners and veterinarians. Vitamin E supplementation did not decrease the requirement for rescue pain relief.No changes in clinical pathology variables were observed after 90 days of vitamin E supplementation.Body weight was nega-tively associated with the lameness scores and requirement for rescue pain relief.Conclusion: Vitamin E supplementation did not have any observable positive effects in dogs with naturally occurring osteoarthritis.

J Vet Intern Med.2023;37:1839 –1847.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jvim 1839 Historically, the most common treatment utilized for the management of OA has been nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).3 Recent studies suggest that these medications can lead to severe complications, including renal failure and gastric ulceration.4In 1 study, >80% of dogs treated with NSAIDs developed gastric ulceration.5 Thus, the adverse effects of these commonly used medications may occur at a higher frequency than previously thought.Therefore, inves- tigation of alternative treatment options, including nutraceuticals, tomanage the clinical signs of OA is warranted.6,7 The pathogenesis of OA is complex, but damage by synovial free radicals has been identified as a key process.Oxidative stress causesdecreased chondrogenesis with subsequent cartilage thinning and isan important aspect in the pathogenesis of OA.
8Humans suffering from OA have higher concentrations of oxidants and lower concentra- tions of antioxidants in synovial fluid, supporting their contribution tothe development of OA. 9Vitamin E (VE) is a potent antioxidant found naturally in plants, and in vitro testing on animals has elucidated its ability to decrease the effects of oxidative stress on cartilage.10,11It also has been shown to inhibit specific inflammatory pathways associ- ated with OA, as well as to upregulate antioxidants.12Nitric oxide in high concentrations can increase pain signaling, and VE's action ofdecreasing synovial nitric oxide might decrease clinical signs of pain.13 These findings led to research in humans investigating the use of VEsupplementation in people suffering from OA.The results showedimprovement in both clinical signs and inflammatory markers.
14-21 The only study investigating the use of VE in dogs was conducted after surgical transection of the cranial cruciate ligament and found that supplementation improved lameness and pain scores.21In addi- tion, it decreased the severity of the cartilage damage observed on necropsy examination and resulted in decreased concentrations of nitric oxide and prostaglandins in the synovial fluid.21These initial results in dogs support the hypothesis that, as in humans, VE might not only help modulate intra-articular inflammation and cartilage dam- age but also decrease pain and lameness clinically.
In addition to these postulated benefits in animals and humans with osteoarthritis, VE also may have beneficial effects on the liver and markers of systemic inflammation.22-28Supplementation has been shown to facilitate management of chronic liver disease in humans.22In a study in dogs, a supplement containing VE was shown to decrease liver enzyme activity and liver size in dogs with and without liver dis- ease.25Another study on dogs with OA showed that although CRP con- centrations remained within normal limits, administration of a joint supplement significantly decreased CRP concentrations.29This result was used to support the anti-inflammatory properties of the supple-ment. We hypothesized that VE might have similar properties and might decrease CRP concentrations or biochemical markers of liver injury in dogs over a 90-day study period.We postulated that VE might be beneficial in dogs with naturally occurring OA and sought to investigate its clinical effects.
We hypothe- sized the VE treatment would decrease lameness and pain scores, decrease pain medication requirements and improve the quality of life(QOL) of dogs with OA. We also hypothesized that VE would decrease C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and liver enzyme activity.2|MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 |Study design Our study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, pro- spective clinical trial.Dogs were randomized to treatment or control groups using an online randomization tool ( https://www.randomizer.org/).All veterinarians, support staff, and owners were blinded as to which group (A or B) was receiving VE and which was receiving pla- cebo.One member of the research team, who was not conducting examinations of dogs, was not blinded to the groups in the eventimmediate unblinding was necessary.The study was approved by theCommunity Access Animal Ethics Committee (CA 2021/03/1481).
2.2 |Enrollment of animals Client-owned dogs with clinical and radiographic signs of OA with no other clinically relevant illnesses were recruited. Dogs of any age, breed, and sex were eligible.To minimize the effect body weight might have on the results, only dogs weighing20-40 kg were recruited.Suitable dogs were first assessed by a veteri- narian for lameness or joint pain on physical examination that might be consistent with OA.Radiography was then performed to confirmthe presence of OA in the affected joints.The radiographs wereassessed for OA by a specialist veterinary radiologist.Any dogs with alternative causes of lameness diagnosed on radiographs were excluded from the study.A CBC and serum biochemistry profile were performed on all dogs after the diagnosis of OA and before enrollment.Dogs were excluded if they were considered systemically ill.
This exclusionincluded any recent illness reported by the owners, any marked changes in the clinical pathology test results suggestive of organ dys- function, or any concerns on the dog's physical examination, beyondthe presence of OA. All dogs were examined by the principal investi-gator, and the findings were corroborated by either a board-certified small animal surgeon or a third-year surgical resident.If dogs were already receiving alternative nutraceuticals (any commercially avail-able joint supplement apart from VE) or pain medication (any veteri- nary medication prescribed for pain), these factors were recorded.Any concurrent nutraceutical or pain medication had to have beengiven for at least 3 months before enrollment to ensure no confound- ing effect was present.Dogs that recently had started new medica- tions or supplements were excluded.
2.3 |Power sample size analysis To identify a difference of 1 unit in clinical lameness score between placebo and treatment groups (mean score control group, 18 ± 1; mean score treatment group, 17 ± 1) with a power of 0.95 and alphaerror probability of 0.05 the required sample size was estimated to be 27 per group (54 total). 6We aimed to recruit 68 dogs (34 per group)1840 GORDON ET AL.to account for an approximately 20% case dropout or loss to follow-up.2.4 |Treatment Each dog was given 1 dose of either VE powder 400 IUa(White-E, Virbac Australia Pty Ltd, Milperra, New South Wales) or an equivalentvolume of placebo once daily for 90 days.The dose selected was the same given to dogs in a previous VE study, presented in powder form.21In that study, it was found that 400 IU showed a positive effect on pain scores, was within the recommended dose range, andresulted in increased concentrations of VE in synovial fluid and blood samples.
The placebo powder was identical to the VE powder except for the active ingredient. Identical scoops were given to each partici-pant to ensure uniform administration.Supplement was measured by weight and the exact quantity of powder was dispensed for each dog on enrollment.Compliance with dosing was assessed by the amountof supplement powder remaining at each review and owner records of administered doses.2.5 |Outcome measures 2.5.1 | Owner assessment of pain and quality of life The canine brief pain inventory (CBPI) metric was used to assess owner perception of the dogs' OA and changes noted at home overthe course of the study.The questionnaire was completed by owners on days 0, 30, 60, and 90.The CBPI is validated to assess the effects of OA with 3 scores: pain severity score (PIS), pain interference score(PSS), and QOL score.30These were calculated from the values pro- vided by the owners in a questionnaire of 11 questions.
The pain severity score is used to assess the degree of pain the owner feels thedog experiences. The pain interference score allows insight into howthe pain affects the dog's ability to undertake normal activities.The QOL score is based on the final question and identifies the owner's overall perception of their dog's well-being.The owners were unable to see previous scores and were not given any information regarding the veterinarian's assessment when completing the questionnaire.The CBPI was presented to the ownersin its validated form for the assessment of dogs with OA.31 2.5.2 | Veterinarian assessment of pain and lameness Each dog was assessed for the severity of clinical signs associated with OA at enrollment and at days 30, 60, and 90.The same joint on each dog was assessed at each time point.The lameness assessment was performed by the same veterinarian at each visit.
The investiga-tors assessed lameness at a trot, weight-bearing when standing, pain on palpation, joint range of motion, and assigned an overall severityscore. The scoring system yielded a numerical value for each compo- nent of the examination, from 1 to 5 (Table A1).The scoring system was adapted from another study assessing supplementation in the treatment of OA.6Body condition scores (BCS; 0-9) and body weight was recorded at each visit to account for obese animals and anychanges in body weight throughout the study.2.5.3 | Rescue pain relief requirement At enrollment, the owners were advised that pain medications wereto be given as necessary to control signs associated with OA, and thenumber of doses required would be recorded.The pain medication administered to the dogs was 0.1 mg/kg meloxicam (Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health Australia Pty Ltd, North Ryde,New South Wales) PO SID.Owners were advised to record the num- ber of doses given per month.
The number of doses was reported to the veterinarian at each visit. Some enrolled dogs already were receiv-ing NSAIDs, or other prescribed pain medications, routinely.These dogs had their initial CBPI and lameness examinations performed with these medications being given as prescribed.This procedure was con-tinued throughout the study to prevent changes in clinical signs or lameness associated with the withdrawal of medication.Additional pain relief was available, at the veterinarian's discretion, if NSAIDswere not suitable or sufficient.2.5.4 | Radiographs On admission into the study, all affected joints were radiographed forinterpretation by a radiologist who was blinded to study group alloca-tion.Each joint was assigned a grade of 0 (no osseous signs of OA), 1 (mild changes), 2 (moderate changes), or 3 (severe changes).
Radiog- raphy was performed under sedation using 0.002 mg/kg medetomi-dine (Medetate, Jurox Pty Limited, Rutherford, New South Wales) and0.2 mg/kg butorphanol (Butorgesic, Troy Laboratories, Glendenning, New South Wales) IV and reversed us 0.01 mg/kg atipamezole (Anti- pam, Jurox Pty Limited, Rutherford, New South Wales) IM. 2.5.5 | Clinical pathology Blood samples were collected from each dog at enrollment and at day90.Initial results were used to assess general health before enrollmentas well as establish baseline results before VE administration.Results at day 90 were compared to initial results to identify if VE administration had significant effects on clinical pathology results over 3 months.2.6 |Statistical analysis All data analyses were performed using SAS OnDemand for Aca- demics (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina).The descriptiveGORDON ET AL.1841 statistics of the dependent variables were described by means and SD.
The data of the dependent variables were examined for normaldistribution by inspection of Q-Q plots, histogram, and the Shapiro- Wilk test. Analyses of variance of the dependent variables that had a normal or log-normal distribution (body weight, rescue remedy, differ-ent ordinal scores for the assessment of treatment efficacy) were per- formed using the MIXED procedure.The models included the fixed effects of treatment, period of the study, interaction between treat-ment and period, and body weight as a covariate.The model also included the dog as a random effect to account for repeated measures on the same dog over time.The marginal mean and standard errors ofeach of the dependent variables for treatment, period, and the inter-action between treatment and period were obtained and used for multiple mean comparisons with the Fisher's least significant differ- ence test for post hoc pairwise comparisons as implemented in theLSMEANS option of the MIXED procedure.
For variables that did not have a log-normal distribution and instead had a skewed (Poisson) distribution, analyses of variance wereperformed with the GLIMMIX procedure by a log link transformation with a model that included the same fixed and random effects as described for the above variables. Multiple mean comparisons wereperformed on the log scale, but results are presented as back- transformed marginal means and standard errors.Analyses of variance of hematologic and biochemical variables between treatments at the beginning and the end of the study alsowere performed using the MIXED procedure (for variables that fol- lowed a normal or log-normal distribution) or the GLIMMIX procedure (for those with a Poisson distribution) with a log link transformation.The model included the fixed effects of treatment and the baseline value of the dependent variables, and dog as a random effect to account for repeated measures on the same dog over time.
The Chi-squared test as implemented in the FREQ procedure was used to determine if differences were present between treatment and control groups with respect to the proportion of dog breeds, dogsreceiving nutritional supplements, distribution of BCS across groupsor with respect to the proportion of arthritic joints. The difference in BCS between groups was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney Utest.Significant effects were concluded if P< .05.3|RESULTS 3.1 |Participants Sixty-eight dogs were assessed for eligibility and 5 dogs were excluded (3 dogs had alternate causes of lameness and 2 dogs were withdrawn by the owners; Figure 1).
Fifty-seven of the 63 dogs completed the study, but not all data were available for all dogs (1 dog was euthanizedduring the study for splenic mass rupture confirmed on necropsy, 1 dog was withdrawn from the study because of unwillingness to ingest sup- plement powder, 2 dogs were withdrawn because of development ofsystemic illness, 1 dog was withdrawn because of lymphoma, and 1 dog was withdrawn because of liver neoplasia).Thirty dogs were randomly allocated to receive VE and 27 dogs received placebo. The mean ± SD age (years) of the dogs in the VEgroup (9.5 ± 3.2) did not differ from the placebo group (10.8 ± 2.8; P=.09).The mean ± SD body weight (kg) of dogs in the VE group (33 ± 6) was significantly higher than in the placebo group (28 ± 6;P< .001), but median BCS did not differ between groups (6; P=.38).
No significant changes in mean (±SE) body weight (kg) within and between groups were found over the course of the study (VE groupend of first month, 29.8 ± 0.3; end of second month, 29.7 ± 0.4; end of third month, 29.7 ± 0.3; placebo group end of first month 30.0 ± 0.3; end of 2nd month 30.1 ± 0.3; end of third month 29.9 ± 0.3; P=.83). Elbows (55 joints, 34.4% of all joints) and hips (66 joints, 41.3% of all joints) were significantly more affected by OA than other joints (P< .001) but, dogs enrolled in the study also had OA in the carpi (n=7; 4.4%), tarsi (n =2; 1.3%), stifles (n =17; 10.6%), shoulders (n=1; 0.6%), and lumbosacral spine (n =12; 7.5%).Both groups had a similar distribution of affected joints with no joints significantly over-represented in 1 group ( P=.93).A similar number of affected joints was observed in dogs of both groups ( P=.93).Radiographs were performed on 134 joints and the results of the radiologist scoring is presented in Table 1.
No significant difference was found in the distribution of OA grades across the groups ( P=.39) or in the marginal mean (±SE) of OA grades between groups (VE 1.149 ± 0.149; placebo, 1.461 ± 0.199; P=.21). 3.2 |Clinical lameness and owner questionnaire findings The CBPI consists of 3 scores to assess the clinical severity of OA in dogs: pain severity score (PSS), pain interference score (PIS), and theQOL score.The marginal mean (±SE) of the PSS for dogs in the VE group was 12.7 ± 1.4.It did not differ from PSS in the placebo group (14.3 ± 1.5; P=.45).In both groups, PSS significantly decreased over time ( P=.02).The marginal mean (±SE) of the PIS in the VE group (21.3 ± 2.4) did not differ from the placebo group (25.3 ± 2.6; P=.27).In both groups, PIS significantly decreased over time ( P< .001).The marginal mean (±SE) of the QOL score of dogs in the VE group (3.6± 0.2) did not differ from QOL in the placebo group (3.5 ± 0.2; P=.63).
However, in the VE group, the marginal mean (±SE) QOL significantly increased over time in the first 60 days (day 0, 3.27 ± 0.17; day30, 3.75 ± 0.20; day 60, 3.82 ± 0.21; P<. 0 5 ) .T h ep l a c e b o g r o u ph a d no change in the marginal mean (±SE) QOL over the same time (day 0:3.34 ± 0.18, day 30:3.39 ± 0.21, day 60:3.51 ± 0.21, P<.0 5 ) .No difference was found between the treatment groups in any aspect of the clinical lameness assessment.The scores in both groups improved over the 90 days.Results of the lameness scoring are pre-sented in Table 2.Body weight was analyzed as a confounding factor in all lameness and CBPI scores.Increasing body weight had a marginal effect on the lameness score as assessed by the veterinarian ( P=.05) and a significant effect on the dog's ability to rise from lying as assessed by the owner ( P=.05).1842 GORDON ET AL.Assessed for eligibility (n= 68) Randomized (n = 63) Allocated to vit.

1843 3.3 |Pain medication requirement findings The administration of additional nutraceuticals did not significantly differ between groups (VE 51.7%; vs placebo 48.3%; P=.35), and no significant differences were found in the percentage of dogs requiring at least 1 dose of rescue pain medication (VE, 32%; placebo, 25%; P=.62). Treatment (ie, VE vs placebo) did not have a significant effect on the marginal mean (±SE) number of times rescue pain medication was administered to either the VE group (7 ± 3) or the placebo group (9 ± 3; P=.78), but significant effects of time ( P=.01) and the inter- action between treatment and time ( P=.003) in the VE group were found.The VE group had increased use of pain medication at days 0, 30, and 60 with a decrease in use at day 90 (respective marginalmean [±SE] number of doses: 6 ± 3, 7 ± 3, 9 ± 3, 7 ± 3) whereas theplacebo group had no change in pain medication requirement across the study period.
Increased body weight also resulted in more fre- quent requirement of rescue pain medication ( P=.04). 3.4 |Clinical pathology findings Three months of VE administration did not lead to significant differ- ences in serum biochemical variables at the end of the study com-pared to baseline.The mean (±SD) CRP concentration was withinnormal limits in the VE group (5.02 ± 10.59) and the placebo group (3.62 ± 5.21) and no change in CRP concentration was found in either group from day 0 to 90 ( P=.95).4|DISCUSSION Overall, we showed that VE administration did not improve outcomes in dogs with OA, when compared to placebo.In contrast to the previ-ous study in dogs and many studies in humans, VE supplementation had no positive effect on QOL, pain, lameness, or clinical pathology variables.Also, no decrease in pain medication requirement wasobserved.
The results of the CBPI showed that administration of VE improved QOL in dogs with OA over the first 60 days, but, when com- pared to the placebo group, no significant difference was identified. Itdid not have a positive effect on pain, lameness, or function.Poor QOL is the leading cause of owner-elected euthanasia in dogs.32For this reason, it also has been suggested that the success of a new treatment could be defined by an improvement in QOL as reported by the owners.33These results show that VE supplementation did not improve the QOL in dogs when compared with placebo, based onowner assessment, and therefore cannot be considered an appropri- ate treatment option in OA.Our study did not identify an improvement in pain or lameness in dogs treated with VE as evaluated by veterinarians.These findings dif- fer from the results of studies in humans suggesting that VE can decrease the pain associated with naturally occurring OA.
Our find-ings also differ from the results obtained in the previous veterinary study where VE supplementation decreased pain and lameness after surgical transection of the cranial cruciate ligament in dogs. Disparitiesin these results might be because the dogs in the previous study wereexperiencing acute joint inflammation without the onset of chronic changes associated with advanced OA.Investigation of VE supple- mentation in dogs with acute joint inflammation, such as those under-going arthroscopy, arthrotomy, or acute septic or aseptic arthritis might be warranted.It is also possible that the formulation of VE used was not successful at increasing in vivo concentrations, and bioavail-ability studies would be ideal.A study performed on dogs showed that VE concentrations in synovial fluid of dogs with OA were increased, rather than decreased as was the case in previous studies inhumans.34These findings call into the question the function of VE in joints.
We considered whether increased VE was associated with increased mobilization to synovial fluid to offer chondroprotective effects. It is also possible however that there is minimal utilization ofVE by the synovium.Further investigation into the movement and uti- lization of VE in inflammatory joint disease in dogs is warranted.It is also possible that a numerical scoring system could not detect subtle changes in gait and lameness.Although regularly utilized in both clinical and research settings of veterinary medicine, numerical lameness scoring is not the most sensitive method to detect changesin gait and does not correlate well with objective measurements such as force plate analysis.6,35The same blinded observer was used throughout the study to minimize the effect the subjective nature ofthe scoring system would have on results.In agreement with the vet-erinary assessment, the CBPI scores for pain and lameness, as assessed by the owners, did not improve after VE supplementation.
The CBPI has been validated to assess owners' perception of pain,loss of function, and QOL of dogs suffering from OA, but it does not correlate well with force plate analysis. 31An objective assessment ofTABLE 2 Clinical Lameness Scores (marginal mean ± SE) of placebo and VE dog groups Score/questionPlacebo Vitamin E Day 0 Day 0 Day 30 Day 60 Day 90 Day 30 Day 60 Day 90 Lameness 2.59 ± 0.15 2.18 ± 0.13 1.70 ± 0.15 1.66 ± 0.16 1.60 ± 0.15 1.96 ± 0.16 1.93 ± 0.16 1.84 ± 0.16 Pain on palpation 3.35 ± 0.14 3.37 ± 0.13 2.96 ± 0.16 2.53 ± 0.17 2.43 ± 0.16 2.70 ± 0.16 2.59 ± 0.16 2.64 ± 0.16Joint mobility 3.31 ± 0.24 2.79 ± 0.22 2.55 ± 0.24 2.77 ± 0.25 2.30 ± 0.24 2.79 ± 0.25 2.49 ± 0.25 2.67 ± 0.25Weightbearing 2.25 ± 0.12 2.06 ± 0.11 1.62 ± 0.13 1.56 ± 0.14 1.65 ± 0.14 1.87 ± 0.13 1.82 ± 0.14 1.71 ± 0.14Overall 2.90 ± 0.32 2.51 ± 0.28 2.26 ± 0.33 2.22 ± 0.37 2.12 ± 0.33 2.55 ± 0.35 2.38 ± 0.36 2.18 ± 0.331844 GORDON ET AL.
lameness after VE supplementation is warranted to detect more sub- tle improvements in gait. Pain relief has been a mainstay of treatment for dogs with OA.2,3 The most used pain medication, NSAIDs, recently have been shownto have more frequent adverse effects than those that are clinicallyapparent.4,5Therefore, it would be beneficial to find safer alternatives to minimize the use of these medications.We postulated that if VE has positive effects on the pain and lameness associated with OA, itmay decrease the requirement for other medications.C-reactive protein is an acute in flammatory marker in dogs that is not affected by OA.
36A recent study found that although the results in dogs with OA remained normal, admin istration of a PO joint supplement to dogs resulted in a further decrease in CRP concentrations, supporting its anti-inflammatory properties.29Vitamin E has anti-oxidant and pro- posed anti-inflammatory effects in t he joints, which may have a similar effect in further decreasing CRP. Ou r results found no increase in CRP concentrations in dogs with OA, consistent with previous findings, but no further decrease in CRP concentrations was found after VE adminis-tration.This result supports previous findings that CRP has no diagnostic v a l u ei na s s e s s i n gt h ep r e s e n c eo rs e v e r i t yo fO Ai nd o g s ,a n dt h a tV E does not decrease CRP concentrations.Recently, serum CRP concentra-tion and its correlation with clinical signs of OA in humans have been dis- cussed when high-sensitivity testing is performed.36,37Further evaluation of high-sensitivity CRP in dogs may be warranted.
Body weight had a significant confounding effect on several out- come measures in our study. Increased body weight resulted in higher veterinarian-assessed lameness scores, lower ability to rise scores by owners, and increased use of rescue pain medication.This finding sup-ports the results of other studies suggesting that OA often causes more severe clinical signs in larger or heavier dogs.2,38In these stud- ies, it was not clear whether the increased weight of the affected dogswas associated with breed or body condition.In 1 study, obesity was found to quadruple the risk of cranial cruciate disease in dogs.39In our study, it was breed-related weight that affected the outcomes,rather than increased weight associated with obesity.In our study,even though allocation of dogs was randomized and the weight range was limited, the dogs in the VE group were significantly heavier than those in the placebo group.
This disparity might have resulted in moresevere clinical signs in the treatment group and could have contrib- uted to the lack of improvement in lameness and pain. Our study had several limitations.The use of a numerical lame- ness scoring in dogs has lower sensitivity than force plate analysis or other objective gait analysis techniques.These techniques may have been able to detect more subtle changes in gait.The lack of availabil-ity of force plate analysis in private practice limits the use of this tech- nology.Another limitation is the difference in body weight between the 2 groups.Although attempts were made to prevent this differenceby limiting the weight of dogs enrolled, the use of matched controlsrather than random allocation might have been warranted.The PO supplement utilized was a unique formulation not used in previous studies.This formulation was the only registered and suitable productavailable, but no bioavailability studies were available for the product.
It would have been ideal to test blood or synovial fluid to ensure thatin vivo results were appropriately increased after administration, but doing so was not possible because of cost limitations. Further investigation into the use of VE for dogs with OA is war- ranted.Such studies could include objective lameness assessment, such as kinematic or force plate analysis, to identify subtle changes.Investigation into the use of VE in more acute inflammatory joint con- ditions also is warranted.Confirming the bioavailability of the product is recommended in future studies.5|CONCLUSION Our findings show that administration of VE at 400 IU per day to dogs with naturally occurring OA did not improve QOL, lameness, pain, bio- chemical variables, or pain relief requirements when compared to pla-cebo.The use of VE supplements in dogs affected by OA cannot be recommended based on our results.ACKNOWLEDGMENT No funding was received for this study.
