Behavioral/Cognitive Creatine Supplementation Enhances Corticomotor Excitability and Cognitive Performance during OxygenDeprivation Clare E.Turner,1Winston D.Byblow,2and Nicholas Gant1 1Exercise Neurometabolism Laboratory and2Movement Neuroscience Laboratory, Centre for Brain Research, University of Auckland, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Impairment or interruption of oxygen supply compromises brain function and plays a role in neurological and neurodegenerative conditions.Creatine is a naturally occurring compound involved in the buffering, transport, and regulation of cellular energy, with thepotential to replenish cellular adenosine triphosphate without oxygen.Creatine is also neuroprotective in vitro against anoxic/hypoxic damage.Dietary creatine supplementation has been associated with improved symptoms in neurological disorders defined by impairedneural energy provision.
Here we investigate, for the first time in humans, the utility of creatine as a dietary supplement to protect againstenergetic insult. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of oral creatine supplementation on the neurophysiological andneuropsychological function of healthy young adults during acute oxygen deprivation.Fifteen healthy adults were supplemented withcreatine and placebo treatments for 7 d, which increased brain creatine on average by 9.2%.A hypoxic gas mixture (10% oxygen) wasadministered for 90 min, causing global oxygen deficit and impairing a range of neuropsychological processes.Hypoxia-induced decre-ments in cognitive performance, specifically attentional capacity, were restored when participants were creatine supplemented, andcorticomotor excitability increased.
A neuromodulatory effect of creatine via increased energy availability is presumed to be a contrib-uting factor of the restoration, perhaps by supporting the maintenance of appropriate neuronal membrane potentials. Dietary creatinemonohydrate supplementation augments neural creatine, increases corticomotor excitability, and prevents the decline in attention thatoccurs during severe oxygen deficit.This is the first demonstration of creatine’s utility as a neuroprotective supplement when cellularenergy provision is compromised.Key words: cognition; corticomotor excitability; creatine; dietary supplementation; hypoxia; neural metabolism Introduction The brain is reliant on an uninterrupted supply of energy to maintain electrical membrane potentials, action potential prop-agation, and signaling activities.Impairment or interruption ofneural energy supply compromises brain function and plays arole in the pathogenesis and progression of neurological and neu-rodegenerative conditions.
Acute disruption to energy supply,such as that experienced in ischemic brain injury, can be inducedexperimentally via models that create an hypoxic–anoxic cellularenvironment. Chronic energy disruption degrades cellular struc-ture, which indirectly impairs energy provision processes, such asthe disruption to mitochondrial structure and function that oc- curs in Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’sdisease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Beal, 2005 ;van den Bogaard et al., 2011 ;Martin, 2012 ).Interventions that augment the brain’s local energy stores may be neuroprotective and repre-sent a potential for therapeutic intervention.Creatine (Cr) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent because it can replenish cellular ATP without a reliance onoxygen.Creatine is a critical component of the Cr kinase/phos-phocreatine (CK/PCr) system, which shapes a large metabolicnetwork in the CNS that is highly versatile and involved in manyphysiological functions.
For a review of Cr in the CNS and thefunctioning of the CK/PCr energy system in neurons, we refer thereader to Turner and Gant (2014) . The CK/PCr system is of greater potential relevance in disease states where there is disrup-tion to cellular energy metabolism and diminished capacity tomeet neuronal energy needs.Creatine pretreatment offers a neuroprotective effect against anoxic and ischemic cell damage in vitro , providing enhanced intracellular PCr concentrations, protection against ATP deple-tion, delayed membrane depolarization, and reduced structuraldamage ( Carter et al., 1995 ;Balestrino et al., 1999 ;Shen and Goldberg, 2012 ).Additionally, transfer of neuroprotection hasReceived July 28, 2014; revised Nov.26, 2014; accepted Dec.6, 2014.Author contributions: C.E.T., W.D.B., and N.G.designed research; C.E.T.performed research; C.E.T., W.D.B., and N.G.analyzed data; C.E.T., W.D.B., and N.G.wrote the paper.This work was supported by the University of Auckland.

Despite these convincing findings in vitro , investigation into Cr-mediated effects in the functioninghuman brain have been contradictory, andphysiological mechanisms are poorly un-derstood ( Shefner et al., 2004 ;Tabrizi et al., 2005;NINDS NET-PD Investigators, 2008 ). It is possible to modify brain Cr con- centration with oral Cr monohydrate(CrM) supplementation ( Dechent et al., 1999 ;Lyoo et al., 2003 ), similar to the practice of supplementing skeletal mus-cle, which enhances athletic performanceduring strenuous exercise ( Birch et al., 1994 ).The aim of this study was to con- firm that oral Cr supplementation wouldaugment neural Cr stores, and to assessthe influence of increased neural Cr avail-ability on neuropsychological and neuro-physiological measures.To achieve this,healthy humans were exposed to severeexperimental hypoxia using a gas breath-ing intervention to induce acute energydisruption after dietary CrM supplemen-tation.
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy(MRS) was used to measure neural Cr avail-ability. Computer-based neuropsychologi-cal assessments and transcranial magneticstimulation (TMS) of primary motor cortexwere used to derive measures of cognitivefunction and corticomotor excitability, re-spectively.We hypothesized that oxygen de-privation would severely impair brainfunction, indexed by cognition and cortico-motor excitability, and Cr supplementationwould offset these impairments.Materials and Methods Participants and experimental design Fifteen healthy participants (10 males, 5 fe- males) with a mean age of 31 years (21–55years) volunteered to participate.All partici-pants were right-handed with a mean lateralityquotient of /H1100178% (/H1100623%).Handedness was assessed using the Edinburgh Handedness In- ventory ( Oldfield, 1971 ).
Participants were screened for contraindications to TMS and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and for health complications related to the hypoxia intervention (see below, Hypoxia intervention) and CrM supplementation (see below,Dietary supplementation). All participants gave written informed consent.The study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki andapproved by the institutional ethics committee.A familiarization session was conducted to collect baseline neuropsycho- logical data and to introduce participants to the hypoxia intervention.Twoexperimental sessions involved the collection of neurophysiological, neu- ropsychological, and neuroimaging data at baseline and/or during thehypoxia intervention.Experimental sessions were completed the day af-ter dietary supplementation was complete.See Figure 1 for a schematic representation of experimental procedures.Dietary supplementation Supplementation was performed in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design.
A CrM and placebo (PLA) supplementation regime wasconducted fo r 7 d and separated by a washout period of 5 weeks, shown previously to be effective in reducing tissue Cr concentrations to pre-supplementation levels ( Hultman et al., 1996 ;McKenna et al., 1999 ; Preen et al., 2003 ). Participants were given taste-matched sachets of pow- der for each treatment and instructed to dissolve each dose in one glass ofwater and consume at four equally spaced intervals throughout the day,ensuring that consumption respective to meal times was consistent.Eachdose of the test substance containe d5go fC r M (Musashi creatine mono- hydrate, Nestle ´ Australia), equating to a daily dose of 20 g.Both supple- ments contained 3.75 g of a low-calorie powdered flavoring per dose(Lemon and Lime Flavored Drink Mix, Weight Watchers International).Hypoxia intervention Hypoxia was induced by inhaling a gas mixture with an inspired oxygen fraction of 0.1 for 90 min.
Atmospheric air was diluted with nitrogen andstored as a compressed gas mixture. Gas was delivered from an interme-diate bladder via a one-way valve face-mask system.Respiration was Figure 1.Experimental workflow and procedures.Fifteen healthy participants were recruited to participate in the study.A familiarization session was conducted to collect the baseline neuropsychological assessment (Cognitive Tests) and introduce theparticipant to the hypoxia intervention (Hypoxia).Participants were then randomized into an initial supplementation regime (CrMor PLA), and supplementation was conducted for 7 d, wit h a 5 week washout period.Experimental sessions were conducted 24 h after supplementation, involving the collection of neuroimaging, neurophysiological, and neuropsychological data.Structural MRIwas used to position an MRS volume of interest (voxel) over the hand knob of the primary motor cortex.The location was verifiedwith functional MRI.
The red–yellow contrast shows areas of increased activation during a functional finger-tapping task ( Z/H110222.3, p/H110210.05). Spectroscopy data were acquired and corrected for the proportion of tissue types using neural tissue segmentation and transformed to absolute quantities using a brain-mimicking phantom containing a range of known physiological Cr concentra-tions.Neurophysiological data, as assessed via TMS and PNS, were recorded using surface EMG at baseline and during the hypoxiaintervention to measure central and peripheral excitability levels, respectively.The hypoxia intervention was conducted for 90 minusing a gas mixture with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) of 0.1 and delivered via a one-way valve face-mask system.Cardio - vascular measures [arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP)] were monitored throughout to assess autonomic system regulation to the hypoxic intervention.1774 •J.
Neurosci., January 28, 2015 •35(4):1773–1780 Turner et al. •Creatine Enhances Neural Function during Hypoxia monitored using a pneumotachometer (MLT1000L, ADInstruments), paramagnetic O2analyzer (S-3A/I, AEI Technologies), and infrared CO2 analyzer (CD-3A, AEI Technologies).Arterial oxygen saturation, heartrate, and blood pressure were continuously monitored throughout thehypoxia intervention by a pulse oximeter (VacuMed), heart rate monitor(Polar Electro), and digital automatic blood pressure monitor (Omron),respectively.A gas wash-in period of 15 min allowed for the hypoxicventilatory response and stable reduction in arterial oxygen saturation,after which neuropsychological assessment and neurophysiological pro-cedures were performed.Neuropsychological assessment A standardized and automated computerized battery of neuropsycho-logical tests was used to assess neuropsychological function (CNS VitalSigns; http://www.cnsvs.com/ ).
The test battery comprised seven tests: verbal and visual memory, finger tapping, symbol digit coding, theStroop test, a test of shifting attention, and a continuous performancetest. A detailed description of each test is given by Gualtieri and Johnson (2006) .Computer instructions on how to complete each test were given before the test along with practice sessions when necessary.Tests were initi-ated and supervised by an experimenter and delivered unassisted and unin-terrupted using a laptop computer to ensure consistency in administration.Test scoring was generated from 17 primary scores based on correct responses, error responses, number of responses, and reaction times.Primary scores were used to generate nine neurocognitive domain scoresto reflect basic mental functions (composite memory, verbal memory,visual memory, processing speed, executive function, psychomotorspeed, reaction time, complex attention, and cognitive flexibility) and anoverall neurocognitive index score.
Domain scores were generated as rawscores, calculated from composite primary scores of relevant tests, andthen computed to standard scores and percentiles that represent theparticipants’ raw score relative to an age-matched normative data set ofhealthy individuals. Standardized domain scores and the 17 primaryscores were used for statistical analysis.Upon completion of the test battery, a six-point Likert-type rating scale was presented on the computer screen prompting the participant torate their current level of alertness ranging from 1 (exhausted, unable tofunction effectively) to 6 (fully awake and excellent alertness).Baseline neuropsychological testing was conducted during the famil- iarization trial when the participant was inhaling atmospheric air.During the experimental sessions, participants completed neuropsychological as-sessments during hypoxia, immediately following a 15 min wash-in with thehypoxic gas mixture.Neurophysiological procedures Preparation.
Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) and TMS were used to evaluate peripheral and corticomotor excitability levels, respectively.Each participant was seated comfortably in a chair with their arms restedon a cushion in their lap. Skin sites were prepared using standard tech-niques for surface electromyography (EMG) collection of the right firstdorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in a tendon-belly arrangement, withthe reference electrode on the dorsal surface of the hand.Raw EMGsignals were amplified and filtered (3 Hz to 1 kHz, P511AC, Grass Instru-ments), sampled at 2 kHz, and stored for offline analysis using customLabView software.Transcranial magnetic stimulation .A figure-of-eight coil (70 mm) was used to apply focal TMS over the hand area of the left motor cortex usinga MagStim 200 magnetic stimulator (MagStim; maximum output inten-sity, 2.0 T).
The coil was positioned over the motor cortex contralateral tothe target muscle with the coil handle directed posteriorly and rotatedaway from the midline at an angle of /H1101145° to produce posterior-to- anterior current flow perpendicular to the precentral gyrus ( Kaneko et al., 1996 ). The optimal scalp site for stimulation was defined as the posi- tion that consistently produced the greatest motor evoked potential(MEP) amplitude in the contralateral FDI muscle for a given stimulatorintensity.This was determined by stimulating sites over the motor cortexin a 1 cm grid pattern.The optimal scalp site was marked, and all stim-ulation from this point on was conducted at this location.Stimulus–response (SR) curves of the FDI motor cortex were assessed at rest inresponse to stimulation intensity increments of 5% maximum stimulator output (MSO), from 40 – 85% MSO ( Devanne et al., 1997 ).Six stimuli were delivered at each intensity with the intensity order randomized.
Restmotor threshold (RMT), defined as the lowest stimulator intensity evok-ing MEPs in the relaxed FDI with amplitudes of at least 50 /H9262V in four of eight trials, was evaluated separately ( Rossini et al., 1994 ). Peripheral nerve stimulation .The ulnar nerve was stimulated using surface electrodes placed 2 to 4 cm proximal to the wrist of the right arm(cathode, proximal).Electrical stimulation was delivered by a constantcurrent Digitimer stimulator (DS7A).The optimal site for stimulation,defined as the position that consistently produced the greatest M waveamplitude in the right FDI for a given stimulator intensity, was found,and all peripheral stimulation was delivered from this site.The stimula-tion intensity was gradually increased until M wave amplitude did notincrease further.To ensure supramaximal stimulation, the intensity wasincreased to 110% of maximum, and 20 supramaximal stimuli weredelivered.Data analysis.
Peak-to-peak FDI MEP and M wave amplitude and prestimulus root mean square EMG (rmsEMG) were analyzed for all SRcurve data. Background muscle activity before the stimulus was moni-tored, and trials were discarded when the rmsEMG calculated in the 100ms window before the stimulus exceeded 10 /H9262V.The remaining MEP peak-to-peak amplitude data were ordered and trimmed to remove out-liers.Motor evoked potential amplitudes were normalized to the largestremaining MEP collected within a session, and SR curves were con-structed from seven stimulation intensities (one subthreshold and sixsuprathreshold) at each condition (normoxic baseline and hypoxia).Thesum of the mean normalized MEP amplitudes at the seven stimulationintensities were determined, and the area under the SR curve was calcu-lated at each condition ( /H9018MEP).Threshold stimulus intensity was ana- lyzed for all RMT data.Peak-to-peak FDI M wave amplitude wasanalyzed for all PNS data.
The relative change in /H9018MEP, RMT, and M wave amplitude measures from baseline were calculated for both supple-mentation regimes and used for statistical analyses. All neurophysiological procedures were conducted the day immedi- ately following supplementation.Neurophysiological outcome measures(/H9018MEP, RMT, and M wave amplitude) were collected at baseline while inhaling atmospheric air and during hypoxia following a 15 minwash-in with the hypoxic gas mixture and the neuropsychologicalassessment.Neuroimaging procedures Image acquisition .All images were acquired using a Siemens Skyra 3 T scanner.A high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical data set (FOV, 256 mm sagittal; voxel dimensions, 1.0 /H110031.0/H110031.0 mm) was acquired for each participant.
Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrastimages were acquired using a T 2*-weighted single-shot echoplanar se - quence (TR, 3 s; voxel dimensions, 2.0 /H110032.0/H110033.0 mm; 42 oblique axial slices with a 1 mm gap) with online analysis used to monitor real-timeBOLD activation in response to a finger-tapping motor task. Single-voxelspectroscopy data were acquired using a PRESS (point-resolved spectros-copy) sequence (TR, 2 s; TE, 30 ms; 80 averages).A 20 /H1100320/H1100320 mm voxel of interest was placed over the left precentral gyrus on the handknob of the primary motor cortex to target the hand motor representa-tion using anatomical landmarks from each participant’s T 1-weighted image ( Yousry et al., 1997 ).Functional task .
Participants were instructed to keep their right hand relaxed (rest) when a circle was presented on a visual presentation viewedby a mirror in the head coil and to initiate and maintain a rhythmic pinchof their right index finger to thumb at the rate of /H110111 Hz when a cross (active) was presented. The task cycled between rest and active condi-tions four times.Each condition lasted 30 s, resulting in a total functionalscan of 4 min.Spectroscopy and image analysis.Quantitative analysis of the spectra were performed using the Java-based Magnetic Resonance User In-terface software package ( http://www.mrui.uab.es/mrui/ ;Naressi et al., 2001a ,b).The free induction decay signal was corrected for any non- zero DC offset.The residual water signal was supressed by fitting andremoving Gaussian peaks around the water frequency using singularTurner et al.•Creatine Enhances Neural Function during Hypoxia J.Neurosci., January 28, 2015 •35(4):1773–1780 • 1775 value decomposition techniques.
Zero-order phase correction was applied manually to correct for peak distortion. Spectral analysis was performed inthe time domain using a nonlinear least-squares-fitting optimization algo-rithm ( Vanhamme et al., 1997 ).Prior knowledge constraints for peak fitting were optimized for N-acetylaspartate (NAA), Cr, and choline (Cho) res- onances and set as follows.A relative phase of 0° was applied to all peaks.A fixed ratio line width, restrained to the prominent NAA peak, wasapplied to the remaining Cr and Cho peaks.Upper and lower fre-quency bounds were specified using the soft constraints function forthe peak position.All peak shapes were specified as a fixed Lorentziancurve.The participants’ T 1-weighted structural images were extracted and segmented using BET (brain extraction tool; Smith, 2002 ) and FAST (FMRIB’s automated segmentation tool; Zhang et al., 2001 ), respectively, both part of the FMRIB software library ( www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl ).
The amplitude of the Cr peaks (primary peak at 3.069 ppm and secondarypeak at 3.960 ppm) were corrected for the proportion of total brain tissuevolume (gray and white matter) within the voxel of interest ( Stagg et al., 2011 ). The corrected peak amplitudes were then converted to absolute concentration units.An interpolation procedure obtained as a result ofscanning a brain-mimicking phantom ( Woo et al., 2007 ) with a range of known physiological Cr concentrations and regressing them with theircorresponding resonance amplitudes was used.All neuroimaging data were collected the day immediately following supplementation.Neuroimaging measures were collected at baselinewhile participants were inhaling atmospheric air.Statistical analyses A two-way repeated-measures (RM) ANOVA was used to assess the ef-fect of supplementation and hypoxia on oxygen saturation, heart rate,and mean arterial blood pressure.
Within-subjects factors were defined:treatment (CrM and PLA) and time (nine levels at 10 min intervals).Paired-samples ttests were used to assess the effect of supplementation on sensorimotor cortex Cr concentration, gray matter, white matter, andcerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proportions in the MRS voxel of interest, neu-ropsychological and neurophysiological outcome variables collectedduring hypoxia. One-sample ttests were used to assess the effect of hyp- oxia on neuropsychological and neurophysiological measures.Baselinevalues for neuropsychological hypoxia comparisons use between-sessions data (from the familiarization trial), whereas relative neuro-physiological measures ( /H9018MEP, RMT, and M wave amplitude) use within-session data from 0 min.
Two data sets were contaminated byelectrical interference and excluded from neurophysiological analyses.Linear regression analyses were performed to examine the associationbetween the supplementation bias with CrM in neuropsychological andneurophysiological measures from baseline. This analysis was also usedto assess the association between the bias in Cr accrued during CrM and the neurocognitive index from baseline.Results Effectiveness of creatine supplementation First we examined whether 1 week of dietary CrM supplementa-tion was effective in augmenting total neural Cr concentrationwithin the hand knob of the left precentral gyrus.Using MRS, wedetected an increase in the amplitude of the primary MRS-induced Cr /H11001PCr peak at 3.069 ppm ( Fig.2 ; paired-samples t test, t(14)/H110051.83; p/H110050.04).
This shows tha t7do f oral CrM supplementation is able to increase the amount of Cr stored in the brain (7.03 /H110061.62 mmol/L) compared to PLA supplementa- tion (6.44 /H110060.90 mmol/L). Both the primary and secondary Cr /H11001 PCr peaks exhibited a similar bias between treatments, but nostatistical difference was detected in the secondary peak at 3.960ppm (paired-samples ttest, t (14)/H110051.20; p/H110050.13).The secondary peak is typically smaller than the primary peak, so less signal is detected during data acquisition, resulting in a lower signal-to-noise ratio.The density of gray matter within the region of inter- Figure 2.Neural creatine concentration after supplementation.a, Mean Cr concentration detected in the sensorimotor cortex increased after 1 week of dietary CrM supplementation (black bars) compared to PLA (white bars).

Neurosci., January 28, 2015 •35(4):1773–1780 Turner et al. •Creatine Enhances Neural Function during Hypoxia est (CrM, 0.34 /H110060.05; PLA, 0.37 /H110060.06) was similar for both treatments (paired-samples ttest, t(14)/H11005/H11002 1.94; p/H110050.07).This trend ( p/H110050.07) was not associated with supplementation- induced changes in CrM concentration (linear regression; R2/H11005 0.06; F(1,14)/H110050.80; p/H110050.39).There were also no changes in white matter (CrM, 0.55 /H110060.09; PLA, 0.51 /H110060.09) and CSF (CrM, 0.11 /H110060.05; PLA, 0.13 /H110060.04) between the supplementa- tion treatments (paired-samples ttests; white matter, t(14)/H110051.75, p/H110050.10; CSF, t(14)/H11005/H11002 1.14, p/H110050.27).Assessment of global oxygen deficit We monitored cardiovascular responses ( Fig.3 ) and ventilatory adjustments during the hypoxic insult to confirm that the gasmixture (FiO 2/H110050.10) induced the expected oxygen deficit.
Ar - terial oxygen saturation was significantly reduced (RM ANOVA;F (8,88)/H1100518.42; p/H110210.01), and heart rate displayed the expected compensatory increase (RM ANOVA; F(8,88)/H1100511.29; p/H110210.01). Importantly, these responses were identical between nutritional treatments, suggesting that the disruption to energy metabolismwas comparable for CrM and PLA treatments.Assessment of neuropsychological function The disruption to cognitive function caused by hypoxia was accessedin a range of neuropsychological tests.Cognitive domains degradedby hypoxia were complex attention (one-sample ttest,t (14)/H11005/H110022.04; p/H110050.03), composite memory (one-sample ttest,t(14)/H11005/H110022.07; p/H11005 0.03), psychomotor speed (one-sample ttest, t(14)/H11005/H11002 2.01; p/H11005 0.03), and the overall neurocognitive index (one-sample ttest, t(14)/H11005/H11002 2.21; p/H110050.02).
A trend for decreases in performance were found in visual memory (one-sample ttest, t(14)/H11005/H11002 1.36; p/H110050.098) and cognitive flexibility (one-sample ttest, t(14)/H11005 /H110021.40; p/H110050.09). Hypoxia also abolished any task learning effect that is observed when cognitive tests are repeated in normoxicconditions.Verbal memory, processing speed, executive func-tion, and reaction time tests were robust to hypoxia.Creatine supplementation improved performance in a num- ber of cognitive scores, effectively offsetting the decrements thatwere observed with hypoxia ( Table 1 ).Creatine was particularly efficacious at improving tasks involving complex attention(paired-samples ttest, t (14)/H110051.78; p/H110050.049).
Trends for im - provements were observed in executive function (paired-samplesttest, t (14)/H110051.47; p/H110050.08), cognitive flexibility (paired-samples ttest, t(14)/H110051.55; p/H110050.07), and neurocognitive index (paired- samples ttest, t(14)/H110051.56; p/H110050.07; Fig. 4 ).Because cognitive Figure 4.Changes in cognitive domain scores with hypoxia.Hypoxia degraded performance significantly in four neurocognitive domains with PLA (white bars), but these decrements werelessened or prevented with CrM (black bars).Standard scores are raw scores relative to anage-matched normative data set of healthy individuals.Bars show the mean /H11006SEM.* p/H11021 0.05; † p/H113500.05 and/H110210.1.Table 1.

Bold type highlights statistically significant comparisons.Turner et al. •Creatine Enhances Neural Function during Hypoxia J.Neurosci., January 28, 2015 •35(4):1773–1780 • 1777 domain standard scores were higher when supplemented with CrM under hypoxia compared to those recorded when supple-mented with PLA under hypoxia, these results suggest that sup-plementing with CrM may counteract the detrimental effect ofhypoxia on a range of cognitive functions.Assessment of neurophysiological function Hypoxia led to an increase in corticomotor excitability (assessedvia the area under the SR curve; /H9018MEP) that was greater with CrM supplementation (1.09 /H110061.17; paired-samples ttest, t (12)/H11005 1.85; p/H110050.04) compared to PLA supplementation (0.21 /H110061.33; one-sample ttest, t(12)/H110050.57; p/H110050.29; Fig.5 a).
It seems unlikely that the earliest excitable components contributing to the MEPwere involved in this response, as measures of RMT were unal-tered by hypoxia (one-sample ttest, t (12)/H110050.93; p/H110050.19) or CrM supplementation (paired-samples ttest, t(12)/H11005/H11002 0.78; p/H11005 0.22). Also, the maximal M wave amplitude was robust to hyp- oxia (one-sample ttest, t(12)/H110050.78; p/H110050.23) and CrM supple - mentation (paired-samples ttest, t(12)/H110050.83; p/H110050.21), suggesting that neuromuscular transmission was consistent throughout, and membrane excitability was unaltered by respi-ratory alkalosis ( Higashi et al., 1972 ).Importantly, there was a significant and strong ( r/H110050.8) pos- itive correlation between changes in excitability and overall neu-rocognitive index scores with PLA (linear regression; R 2/H110050.59; F(1,12)/H1100515.98; p/H110050.002), but not CrM (linear regression; R2/H110050.02; F(1,12)/H110050.24; p/H110050.63).
Lower levels of corticomotor ex - citability were associated with reduced cognition with PLA, butthis relationship was abolished with CrM supplementation ( Fig. 5c).The quantity of neural Cr accrued during supplementation (from CrM MRS data) did not predict the extent to which neu-rocognitive deficits were corrected during hypoxia (linear regres-sion; R 2/H110050.002; F(1,12)/H110050.02; p/H110050.88).Discussion In this study we used a simple dietary supplementation strategy to augment neural Cr stores, increase corticomotor excitability, andprevent the decline in cognition, and particularly attentional ca-pacity, that accompanies severe oxygen deficit.These results sup-port the idea that Cr may be neuroprotective, a finding that hasonly been reported previously in vitro .
Dietary CrM supplementation may have influenced similar cellular processes to those reported in vitro : delaying hypoxia- induced membrane depolarization, effectively maintaining neu-ronal integrity, and better sustaining basic neuronal function.When Cr is administered before oxidative stress, impaired pro-tein synthesis and axonal damage are prevented, promotinggreater amplitude and duration of neural activity. This is, in turn,protective against synaptic transmission failure and delays theonset of anoxic depolarization that ultimately reduces neuronaldeath ( Kass and Lipton, 1982 ;Lipton and Whittingham, 1982 ; Balestrino, 1995 ;Carter et al., 1995 ;Wilken et al., 1998 ,2000 ; Figure 5.Corticomotor excitability and correlations with cognition during hypoxia.a, Stimulus–response curves for CrM and PLA treatments during normoxic (circles) and hypoxic (triangles) conditions.

Creatine stores may have enhanced anaerobic energy provi-sion by prolonging the transfer of high-energy phosphates toareas of the neuron that require additional energy when oxidativeglycolysis is compromised by hypoxia. These processes can slowthe rate of fall in ATP levels that is typically experienced duringoxygen deprivation.Surprisingly however, the magnitude of Crstored by supplementation did not predict the extent to whichneurocognitive deficits were corrected during hypoxia.This find-ing might suggest possible nonenergetic, neuromodulatory rolesfor Cr as proposed by Rambo et al.(2012) ,Royes et al.(2008) , andSouza et al.(2012) .Similar outcomes have been reported in skeletal muscle, where the same CrM supplementation regimenresults in variable intramuscular Cr concentrations ( Greenhaff et al., 1994 ;Lukaszuk et al., 2002 ,2005 ) but consistent performance improvements ( Birch et al., 1994 ).
Dietary CrM supplementation restored the cognitive decline associated with hypoxia-induced oxygen deprivation. The hyp-oxia intervention had a profound negative effect on a range ofcognitive functions, consistent with previous work that has ex-amined cognitive performance at high altitudes ( Virue ´s-Ortega et al., 2004 ;de Aquino Lemos et al., 2012 ;Asmaro et al., 2013 ).The neurocognitive index score that represents overall cognitivefunction was reduced by 12% with hypoxia, indicative of a dropin performance from the 60th percentile to the 45th percentilewhen compared to an age-matched normative data set.These arelarge decrements that highlight the importance of an uninter-rupted energy supply for maintaining basic neuronal function tosustain complex cognitive processes.
Enhanced Cr availabilitywas able to restore or partially correct several cognitive deficien-cies, with complex attentional processes most improved by CrM(21% difference compared to PLA), perhaps via more efficientanaerobic energy delivery during the most aerobically stressfulmental tasks. These new findings also demonstrate that increased neural Cr availability has a neuromodulatory influence upon cortical excit-ability during acute hypoxia.Hypoxia-induced changes in excit-ability were associated with widespread decrements in cognitionin the PLA condition, but not with CrM supplementation.Theenhanced energy-buffering capacity that is afforded by aug-mented Cr stores may have prevented hypoxia-induced disrup-tions to the maintenance of cellular membrane potential.Thesedisruptions are evident during complete oxygen deprivation,where maintenance of neuronal resting membrane potential atan adequate level necessary for normal neuronal function is notpossible ( Shen and Goldberg, 2012 ).
Modulation of Na/H11001/K/H11001- ATPase activity by intracellular Cr has been proposed as a poten- tial mechanistic pathway for this effect ( Royes et al., 2008 ;Rambo et al., 2012 ,2013 ;Souza et al., 2012 ). The action that Cr may have on Na/H11001/K/H11001-ATPase function and how this directly influences neural excitability levels is not entirely understood and warrants further investigation.Neural excitability did not appear to be effected by the hyp- oxia intervention alone, as we hypothesized based on existing in vitro work examining anoxic depolarization.Neither did baseline corticomotor excitability change with CrM supplementationalone.However, when oxygen delivery was disrupted in the pres-ence of enhanced neural Cr levels, corticomotor excitability in-creased by 70% and was associated with improved cognition.This neuromodulatory response may overcome neuronal defi-ciencies caused by hypoxia, but might only be possible when cells are in a high-energy state.
The level of the neural axis modified byCrM supplementation in the presence of hypoxia is difficult todetermine definitively with noninvasive studies in humans. Ourstudy suggests the increased excitability was mediated, at least inpart, via supraspinal circuits.Creatine concentration increased by 9.2% within the mea- sured volume of interest after 1 week of dietary CrM supplemen-tation, and MEPs were obtained from stimulation of this region.Although we cannot know about Cr concentrations in otherbrain regions, previous studies have reported widespread andsystemic increases in Cr storage following dietary CrM supple-mentation.Regions examined previously include gray matter ofthe frontal ( Lyoo et al., 2003 ) and parietal cortices, white matter tracts of the parietooccipital lobe, deep gray matter in the thala-mus, and the central cerebellum ( Dechent et al., 1999 ).
This is the first in vivo investigation into the involvement of CrM supplementation in brain function during oxygen depriva-tion in humans. Dietary CrM supplementation augments thestorage of Cr in the brain.Enhanced availability of neural Crprevents deterioration to cognitive functions associated with at-tention and increases corticomotor excitability during oxygendeprivation.These findings provide insight into the importance of the CK/ PCr energy system in the human brain and demonstrate that 7 dof CrM supplementation has potential utility as an ergogenic aidand neuroprotective supplement when cellular energy provisionis compromised.Because impaired energy metabolism and fail-ure to maintain adequate membrane potential play a critical rolein the pathogenesis and progression of a range of neurologicaland neurodegenerative conditions, this work also provides evi-dence to support the study of CrM as a therapeutic supplement.
