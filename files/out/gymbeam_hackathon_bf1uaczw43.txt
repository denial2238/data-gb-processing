Analysis of aroma components from sugarcane to non-centrifugal cane sugar using GC-O-MS Erbao Chen,aHuanlu Song, aYi Li,bHaijun Chen,cBao Wang,bXianing Che,b Yu Zhang *aand Shuna Zhao *b A total of 84 volatile aroma components were determined in the 9 samples of sugarcane to non-centrifugal sugar (NCS), including 15 alcohols, 12 aldehydes, 10 ketones, 17 carboxylic acids, 11 pyrazines, 7 phenols, 3esters, 3 hydrocarbons, and 2 sulfur compounds.Of these compounds, 10 were with high ﬂavor dilution (FD) factors based on the aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA).4-Hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2 H)furanone exhibited the highest FD factor of 2187, followed by ( E)-2-nonenal, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-2- cyclopentene-1-one, and 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol with a FD factor of 729.The odor compoundsshowed no signi ﬁcant change and were similar to that of sugarcane during the ﬁrst four steps in the production of non-centrifugal cane sugar.
In the middle three stages, the heating slightly a ﬀected the aroma composition. Additionally, a prolonged period of high-temperature heating, lead to the production of the Maillard reaction products, such as pyrazines, pyrroles, and furans, di ﬀerentiating the step to be unique from the previous seven stages.However, the content of the NCS odorants wassigniﬁcantly reduced due to the loss of odor compounds during the drying process.1.Introduction Sugarcane belongs to several species of tall perennial grasses of the genus Saccharum and is characteristically tropical orsubtropical with a high concentration in South Asia.It is animportant economic crop and widely grown as a commercialcrop primarily in Brazil, USA, Mexico, India, China, Thailand,and Australia.1Sugarcane is a rich source of sugar and o en used for sugar production as it can store high concentrations ofsugar in the stem.
1The products derived from sugarcane include sugar, molasses, rum, bagasse, and ethanol.1,2China is the 3rdlargest sugar producing country in the world a er Brazil and India.3In the recent decade, sugarcane contributed more than 90% of the total sugar production.3The extraction of juice by squeezing the sugarcane through the mill produces a largeamount of bagasse. However, a small amount of sugar stillremains in the bagasse.Therefore, it is necessary to mill thebagasse again a er spraying hot water on the bagasse.4The obtained juice is transported to the puri cation system with the addition of calcium oxide and sodium bicarbonate to acceleratethe precipitation and reduce acrylamide production, 5–7followedby water evaporation, juice concentration to obtain the syrup.Finally, the syrup is crystallized by mechanical agitation ormanual stirring between 115 to 120 /C14C and molding to give a solid shape (Fig.
2).4,5 NCS is characterized by several phenolic and avonoid compounds having antioxidant properties and therefore, exerts potential bene ts for the organisms,8–14and the enzymatic browning of phenol a ﬀects the color of sugarcane.15Addition- ally, NCS exerts immune activity, cytoprotective e ﬀects, anti- caries, and anti-cancer properties.16,17Asikin et al.18studied the physicochemical properties of NCS during the storage, andfound the color of NCS to be darker. He also observed increasedwater content and water activity, as well as reduced glucose and fructose content due to their participation in the Maillard reaction.Similarly, Huang et al.19analyzed the odor compo- nents of NCS and determined acetaldehyde, 2-methylbutyr-aldehyde, 3-methylbutyraldehyde, 2,6-dimethylpyrazine,nonanal, 2,6-diethylpyrazine, 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, furfural,2,3-dimethylpyrazine, decanal, and 2-acetylpyrrole to be themain components based on their relative concentration.Julianaet al.
20extracted a total of 6 odor compounds from NCS beverage using a mixture of diethyl ether –pentane (1 : 1, w/w) as the solvent through simultaneous steam distillation-solventextraction. Of the 6 components, 2-methylpyrazine was thekey aroma compound of this beverage.Takahashi et al.21 prepared 2 types of NCS from the whole stalk (W-NCS) and separated pith of sugarcane (P-NCS) and observed no signi cant diﬀerence between the sugars and minerals' compositions of the 2 types of sugar.Therefore, their taste pro le was veryaCollege of Food and Health, Beijing Technology and Business University (BTBU), Beijing, China, 100048.E-mail: zhang_yu@btbu.edu.cn bCOFCO Nutrition and Health Research Institute Co.Ltd., Beijing Engineering Laboratory of Geriatric Nutrition & Foods, Beijing Key Laboratory of Nutrition &Health and Food Safety, Nutrition & Health Branch of China Knowledge Center for Engineering Science and Technology, Beijing, China, 102209.

Materials and methods 2.1 Materials The 9 samples were obtained from a sugar factory named YUEBEI Brown Sugar in Qingyuan, Guangdong province, China.Samples were stored at a /C025 /C14C refrigerator prior to the anal- ysis. The 9 samples used in this experiment are listed in Table 1.2.2 Standards and reagents Chemicals (purity > 99%), such as ethyl ether, n-hexane, and anhydrous sodium sulfate were purchased from Lab Gou e-mall(Beijing, China).Other chemicals, including 2-methyl-3-heptanone, n-alkanes (C 7–C30) were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich (St.Louis, U.S.A.).Nitrogen gas (99.9992% purity) wasobtained from Beijing AP BAIF Gases Industry Co., Ltd.(Beijing, China) and the liquid nitrogen was obtained from XianHeyu Trading Co., Ltd.(Beijing, China).2.3 Volatile aroma components analysis 2.3.1 Odor compounds extraction from sugarcane.Sugar- cane was cut into small bricks, frozen by liquid nitrogen, and then, ground into powders.
The volatile aroma components ofthe sugarcane were extracted using an organic solvent followedby a liquid –liquid extraction (LLE) method. 22In brief, 100.00 g of sample, 50 mL of diethyl ether, 50 mL of dichloromethane,and 5 mL of internal standard 2-methylheptan-3-one (81.6 mg mL /C01) were mixed in a triangular ask, and was stirred for 10 minutes with a magnet (3 cm /C28 mm diameter) at 1000 rpm.Aer centrifugation (Hitachi, Japan) for 30 minutes at 10 000 rpm, the extract containing volatile aroma componentswere separated by a straw.A erward, the extract was dehydrated over 150.0 g anhydrous sodium sulfate for 12 h at 4 /C14C and ltered using a lter paper.The volume was then reduced to 100 mL under a gentle nitrogen stream, and the obtained volatile aroma component extract was stored at /C025/C14C until further assayed.2.3.2 Odor compounds extraction from liquid sample.
For liquid sample preparation, 100 mL sample, 50 mL of diethylether, 50 mL of dichloromethane, and 5 mL of internal standard 2-methylheptan-3-one (81.6 mg mL /C01) were mixed in a trian- gular ask and then stirred for 10 minutes with a magnet at 1000 rpm. The extraction process was the same as described in the 2.3.1 Section.2.3.3 Odor compounds extraction from NCS.For NCS sample preparation, 100.00 g NCS was dissolved in 100 mL ofdistilled water.Then, all NCS aqueous solution sample, 50 mLof diethyl ether, 50 mL of dichloromethane, and 5 mL of internal standard 2-methylheptan-3-one were mixed in a triangularask, and stirred for 10 minutes with a magnet at 1000 rpm.The extraction process was the same as described in the 2.3.1 Section.2.3.4 Gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrom- etry (GC-O-MS).An Agilent 7890A gas chromatography (GC) Fig.1 Production diagram from sugarcane to NCS.Fig.2 Sugarcane.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 RSC Adv.

Further identi cation was conrmed by comparing their avors and their linear retention indices (RIs) towards a homologous series of n-alkanes (C 7–C30). The resulting peak was calibrated by area of the internal stan-dard, and the content of aroma compounds was expressed as nanograms per gram sample.23All the analyses were carried out in triplicate.2.3.6 Aroma extraction dilution analysis (AEDA).Aroma Extraction Dilution Analysis (AEDA) was employed to charac-terize the contribution of odorants to the overall aroma.24For AEDA, aroma extracts were stepwise-diluted with the mixture ofdichloromethane and diethyl ether (1 : 1, v/v) in a 1 : 2 ratio.The sensory evaluation was performed viaGC-O-MS by three panelists (two females and one male).Detection of an odor at the sni ﬃng port sni ﬀed by at least two panelists was considered as the availability.2.4 Statistical analysis All the experiments were carried out in triplicate, and the data were expressed as the mean /C6standard deviation.
Statistical analyses were conducted using SIMCA 14.1 (MKS InstrumentsAB, USA), OriginPro 2020b (OriginLab Corp., Washington, MA,USA) and Microso Excel 2019 (Microso Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). 3.Results and discussion 3.1 Volatile aroma components analysis A total of 84 volatile aroma components were found from the evaluated samples, including 15 alcohols, 12 aldehydes, 10ketones, 17 carboxylic acids, 11 pyrazines, 7 phenols, 3 esters, 3 hydrocarbons, and 2 sulfur compounds (Table 1 and Fig.3).More than half of the avor components in sugarcane were found to be acid compounds (22 175.53 ng g /C01), followed by phenols (6283.11 ng g/C01).These two components, carboxylic acids and phenols, account for 89.04% of the total amount insugarcane.The other compounds that are available in lowcontents are aldehydes, esters, hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols,and heterocyclic compounds (985.59, 842, 652.52, 558.22, 442.56 and 21.94 ng g /C01respectively).
However, no pyrazines were detected in sugarcane. This might attribute to the lowtemperature and low reaction rate of the Maillard reaction.25 Each volatile avor compounds of sugarcane might contribute to the overall aroma quality and characteristic.18Accumulatingstudies indicate that butanoic acid might provide yogurt and papaya aromas, whereas propionic acid provides an acidic characteristic, and hexanoic and octanoic acids provide sweatyor cheesy aromas.18Green and grass odor are the main aroma characteristics of sugarcane, primarily contributed by 1-hex-anol, 2,3-butanediol, hexanal, ( E)-2-octenal, nonanal, ( E)-2- nonenal, acetoxyacetone, formic acid, and nonanoic acid.18,26 Moreover, benzaldehyde contributes a sweet avor to the sugarcane.18A mixture of other volatile components might also complement the complexity of avor characteristics in NCS, viz.
2-heptanol and 1-octen-3-ol (mushroom), 2-ethyl-1-hexanol(rose, green), phenylethyl alcohol (honey), and phenylaceticacid (honey, ower). When the juice was squeezed out from the sugar cane, the contents of carboxylic acids, alcohols, esters, and total compo-nents increased.The contents of ( E)-2-octenal, nonanal, ( E,E)- 2,4-heptadienal and ( E)-2-nonenal signi cantly increased than that in sugarcane.Similarly, in ester group, the contents of ethyl hexadecanoate and dibutyl phthalate also increased.When it comes to the juice extraction mixture, almost all compounds decreased, except phenols and hydrocarbons.Itmay be caused by adding water.During the subsequentextraction process, the total concentration gradually decreased.In the juice extraction mixture with calcium oxide and sodium bicarbonate, the content of the compounds slightly uctuated except for carboxylic acids and phenols.
This phenomenon might have happened by the bacteria during theaddition of calcium oxide and sodium bicarbonate. 27 During the clari cation process, polyacrylamide adsorbs the impurities and mediates the precipitation of some avor compo- nents, causing the loss of avor components.5As a result, the avor content in the clear juice decreased compared to the mixed juice,and the impurities also contained some avor components.However, in the high-temperature clari cation stage, some changes in the generation of pyrazines and other compounds were observed.For instance, hexanal, 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-cyclopentene- 1-one, 3-hydroxy-4,4-dimethyldi- hydro-2(3 H)-furanone, 4 0-hydroxyacetophenone, 2,6-dimethylpyr- azine, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, 2-methoxy-4-acetylphenol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and methyl sulfone wereproduced during this period.
The formation of these compounds might attribute to the maintenance of high temperature for a pro- longed time during the clari cation process, allowing them to undergo complex biochemical reactions. 28Besides, the clean juice started developing slight nutty, roasted, and caramel characteristics,that might be due to the generation of pyrazines (roasted nut, cocoa,roast beef), 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hyd roxybenzaldehyde (sweet, cocoa, nutty), 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-cyclo pentene-1-one (caramellic) and 3- hydroxy-4,4-dimethyldihydro-2(3 H)-furanone (cotton candy).These compounds enrich the overall aroma pro le of clean juice and even later CNS.The clean juice was then transferred to a three-e ﬀect evaporator for evaporation and concentration.The temperatures of the rst, second and third-e ﬀect evaporators were maintained at 105 /C14C, 105/C14C, and 82/C14C, respectively until the solid content reached 93%.

This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 RSC Adv. ,2 0 2 0 , 10, 32276 –32289 | 32283Paper RSC Advances identi ed compounds, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, phenols, heterocyclic compounds, and hydro- carbons, increased signi c a n t l y .H o w e v e r ,as i g n i cant reduction was observed in the contents of esters and sulfur compounds withno much change in pyrazines.Aer boiling at 123 /C14C for 1 h, a thick syrup was obtained.The syrup showed semi-solid and semi- uidity state.At this time, the content of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylicacids, pyrazines, phenols, heterocyclic compounds, esters, hydrocarbons, sulfones, and the total odor compounds reached the highest value.
Of them, the number of pyrazine compoundsincreased from 2 to 10, and the contents increased from 255.63ng g /C01to 10 536.35 ng g/C01due to the Maillard reactions occurring at high temperatures.25Pyrazines are the most popular products of the Maillard reaction with a low thresholdvalue; thus, they are considered as the important avor components in the cooked foods and other high sugar products, such as syrups. Methylpyrazines exhibits nutty and popcorn-like aromas, while 2,6-dimethylpyrazine adds a roasted or cookedavor in foods.They have been shown to be the most dominant aromatic compounds formed by the reaction of L-ascorbic acid with glutamic acid in the presence of water during heating.21 The last sample was the NCS.The content of odor compounds in the NCS reduced due to the loss of a largeamount of odor compounds during the nal cooling molding and drying process.This result was consistent with the results of the Japanese scholar Asikin.
29In NCS, a total of 56 odor components were identi ed, including the volatile compounds categorized by 10 volatile types; 5 alcohols, 6 aldehydes, 9ketones, 12 carboxylic acids, 10 pyrazines, 7 phenols, 4 hetero-cyclic compounds, 1 ester, 3 hydrocarbons, and 1 sulfur-containing compound. Carboxylic acids constituted thelargest group of components in NCS (10 775.00 ng g /C01), fol- lowed by the aldehydes and phenols (8228.72 and 7561.06 ng g/C01respectively), while sulfur compounds constituted the lowest content.Considering the content of each volatilecomponent, the most dominant odor components were 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, hexadecanoic acid, 2,6-di-tert-butyl- p-methylphenol, acetic acid, 4-ethenyl-2- methoxyphenol, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde, and 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2 H)furanone.
Of these odor compounds, 5-methyl furfuryl alcohol, 3,5-dimethoxy-4- hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-cyclopentene-1-one, 3-hydroxy-4,4-dimethyldihydro-2(3 H)-furanone, 4-hydroxy- 2,5-dimethyl-3(2 H)furanone, 4 0-hydroxyacetophenone, and g- butyrolactone provide a caramel, sweet or cotton candy avor to the foods, while furfural and pyrazines provide a roasted orcooked avor to the foods. 18,30,31Besides, ( Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, hexanal, ( E)-2-nonenal and nonanal exhibit grass and green avor.18,26,32They combine with other odor compounds to form the pro le of NCS (Table 2).18 3.2 Aroma extraction dilution analysis (AEDA) and the generation of several compounds with high FD factor The AEDA was employed to characterize the contribution of key aroma compounds in the NCS.A total of 20 compounds,including 5 ketones, 2 aldehydes, 2 phenols, 1 alcohol, 4 pyr- azines, 5 carboxylic acids, and 1 hydrocarbon were detected with FD factors of $1 (Table 3).
It can be seen that 4-hydroxy- 2,5-dimethyl-3(2 H)furanone has the largest FD factor (FD ¼ 2187) and provides a strong caramel odor. According to thecurrent research, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2 H)furanone can be biosynthesized in strawberry using radiotracer 33and cyclization of the intact skeleton.34In contrast, for sugarcane, juice extraction, and clean juice have no 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl- 3(2H)furanone was detected.It is most likely formed by the Maillard reaction through deoxy sugars.33Followed by ( E)-2- Fig.4 The 10 compounds content with the largest FD factor in diﬀerent processing stages.32284 |RSC Adv.,2 0 2 0 , 10, 32276 –32289 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020RSC Advances Paper nonenal, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-cyclopentene-1-one, and 4-allyl- 2,6-dimethoxyphenol with a FD of 729, showing cucumber, caramellic and ower odor respectively.
( E)-2-nonenal is an unsaturated aldehyde with a cucumber and grass odor gener-ated during the peroxidation of fatty acids. 35–37However, oxygen will intensify ( E)-2-nonenal degradation to nonenoic acid.38The (E)-2-nonenal in the juice extraction and juice extraction mixture might have resulted due to the microbial and enzymaticeﬀects.39However, the longer time contact with oxygen may oxidize the ( E)-2-nonenal to nonenoic acid.38Therefore, the ( E)- 2-nonenal in the clean juice and concentrated juice was notdetectable.The FD factor of 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-cyclopentene-1-one is also 729 but was not detected in the previous steps untilthe clean juice.This might attribute to the formatting of theMaillard reaction products during relatively high tempera-tures.40Due to the strong caramel like odor, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl- 2-cyclopentene-1-one is always organoleptically classi ed in the same category as the furanones and pyranones and is o en used as a avoring agent in co ﬀee and caramel.
This compound was also identi ed as a key aroma compound of roasted coﬀee.41The last compound of the FD factor of 729 was 4-allyl- 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, which exhibited a strong antioxidantactivity with a sweet and ower odor, that was identi ed as the key aroma components of wine and crude drugs. 42,43However, the formation of 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol is not clear to date.4-Ethenyl-2-methoxyphenol exhibited a clove and curry like odor and its FD factor was 243.To date, a few studies on itsgeneration have been reported.One of the reports demon-strated that it originates probably from glycosidic bound 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol.
44It is well known that pyrazines are present in a wide variety of heated foodstu ﬀs, notably in the fried or roasted foods, such as potato chips, co ﬀee, cocoa, popcorn, roasted peanuts.45De Kimpe studied the formation of avour compounds from the model reactions of 20 amino acids with ascorbic acid and thirty-six di ﬀerent pyrazines were iden- tied, mostly ethyl and methyl substituted pyrazines.46Besides amino acids, oligopeptides from hydrolyzed whey protein canalso contribute signi cantly to an increased amount of pyr- azines. 473-Ethyl-2,5-dimethylpyrazine, a typical Maillardreaction product that contributes a roast avor to the potato,48is a key odor compound of NCS with a FD factor of 81.It was rst found in the syrup of the 9 samples.At this stage, the contentand variety of pyrazines increased greatly.It is speculated that itis related to Maillard reaction occurred due to a prolongedperiod of high temperature.
Hexanoic acid has an FD factor of81, which exhibits a sweaty odor. It can be detected from therst step to the last step during the NCS production.The initial hexanoic acid comes from sugarcane itself, but in the sugarcane juice, it might be contributed by the microorganisms but the content uctuates slightly.49Hexanoic acid content of clean juice and impurities is lower than that of the mixed juice due totheocculation of polyacrylamide.With evaporation and concentration, hexanoic acid content rises, and then thecontent decreases due to the volatilization during the dryingprocess.3-Hydroxy-4,4-dimethyldihydro-2(3 H)-furanone was detected neither in the sugarcane nor in the sugarcane juice.It wasrst detected in the clean juice.The content of 3-hydroxy- 4,4-dimethyldihydro-2(3 H)-furanone increased in the concen- trated juice.It is speculated that it may be related to the thermalreactions, but the speci c reason behind the formation is still unclear.
This component has also been found in Thai soysauce. 50The change in the initial content of acetic acid might have happened due to the change in the solid content andmicrobial e ﬀect, 51but the drastic change in the syrup might have happened due to the a-dicarbonyl and b-dicarbonyl cleavage of hexose or pentose during the thermal processing.52A large number of Bacillus sp.was found in the soil.The contentof 2-methylpropionic acid increased in the initial steps due tothe microbial fermentation.53–56The Maillard reaction can produce lower fatty acids.The temperature of the concentrationstage was very high, and the small molecular acids in this stagewere likely to be produced by the Maillard reactions (Fig.4).25 3.3 Principal component analysis (PCA) of di ﬀerent processing stages The principal component analysis of all the odor compounds of 9 samples from di ﬀerent stages was carried out using the Fig.5 PCA analysis of di ﬀerent processing stages.

Butanoic acid and 3-methyl-1-butanol also fall inthe same area with these 4 samples, indicating that the twocomponents exhibit a strong e ﬀect on the original sample odor. In the clari cation stage, the temperature increased, and the thermal reaction occurred, which made it di ﬀerent from the rst four stages.The clean juice, impurities, and concentrated juice were grouped into one category, (+)-limonene, ( E)-3-hexen- 1-ol, and 1,2-propanediol fell in the same area, which provedthat these three compounds contributed signi cantly to the odor of these 3 samples.The syrup falls in an area alone, which proves that it is signicantly di ﬀerent from other samples.In fact, the temper- ature and heating time required to form the syrup were much higher and longer than the other stages, followed by the occurrence of the complex chemical reactions, such as Maillardreactions.
3-Ethyl-2,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2-acetylpyrrole, 2-for-mylpyrrole, furfuryl alcohol, 2-acetyl-6-methylpyrazine, 2-methylpyrazine, 2-acetyl-5-methylpyrazine, and 2,3-dime-thylpyrazine fall in the same area with syrup. These compoundsare the products of the Maillard reaction, making the syrupcompletely di ﬀerent from other samples.Therefore, the Mail- lard reaction plays a vital role in di ﬀerentiating the syrup from other samples.The NCS also aggregated into a separate group.2,3-Butane- diol, 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol, and 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazinefell into this area.However, pyrazines originally fell in the syruparea and did not appear in the NCS area again.This happeneddue to the loss of most of the odorants during the dryingprocess, resulting in reduced odor intensity and complexity.Therefore, the nal drying process is critical and should be observed carefully to obtain the NCS with a strong odor.
If thedrying time and the contact area with the air can be reduced,then better complexity and concentration of the NCS can beobtained. 3.4 Heatmap analysis of di ﬀerent processing stages To compare the di ﬀerences among the odor compound contents of the 9 samples, the NCS odor analysis results wereplotted into a heatmap, as depicted in Fig.6.Each column in thegure represents samples from di ﬀerent production steps, and each row represents a di ﬀerent kind of odor compound.The diﬀerent colors in the gure indicate the level of content, such as white refers to the compounds with average content;green refers to the compounds with lower content, and; redrefers to the compounds with higher content.It can be observed from the heatmap that the rst 4 stages exhibited similarity and can be divided into a group.The compounds with red color might be the endogenous compo- nents of plants.These compounds are mainly long-chain alco-hols and carboxylic acids.
57,58Among them, phenylethyl alcohol and ( Z)-3-hexen-1-ol have been proved to be one of the odorcompounds of sugarcane juice.59,60Compounds, such as buta- noic acids, are one of the products of microbial action.59,60 The clean juice, impurity, and concentrated juice can be classi ed into another group. The compounds with high contents in the three samples showed green color in the rst four stages, which proved that the content was distinctlyreduced.Moreover, only a few compounds in these three stagesshow red color, which proved that the content of odorcompounds was overall low.This phenomenon may attribute to the loss of odor compounds during the clari cation process, which reduces the content of odor compounds.Syrup samples can be divided into a single group.The Maillard reaction products such as pyrazines and furanonesprimarily cluster together in this area.
It is speculated that theMaillard reaction occurring at high temperature at this stagemakes syrup obviously di ﬀerent from other samples. The sample in the last column was the NCS, and the color was lighter than the last column.However, the light-colored areas and dark-colored areas in the 2 samples were similar, whichmight be caused by the loss of odor compounds during thedrying process.4.Conclusion In conclusion, a total of 84 odor compounds extracted from the9 samples from di ﬀerent stages in the NCS production line through a liquid –liquid extraction method were detected by GC- O-MS.Further, the AEDA technique revealed 20 key aroma compounds of NCS.
Of them, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2 H)fur- anone (caramel) exhibited the highest FD factor of 2187, fol-lowed by ( E)-2-nonenal (cucumber), 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-2- cyclopentene-1-one (caramel), 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol(sweet, ower), 4-ethenyl-2-methoxyphenol (clove), 3-ethyl-2,5- dimethylpyrazine (potato, roast), hexanoic acid (sweaty), 3-hydroxy-4,4-dimethyldihydro-2(3 H)-furanone (cotton candy), acetic acid (vinegar), and 2-methylpropionic acid (rancid, cheese) having FD factors from 27 to 729 in NCS. In the production line, the syrup stage is considered as the key step in the formation of NCS odor.During this stage, theMaillard reaction generates a variety of Maillard reactionproducts, such as pyrazines, pyrroles, and furans, which addscomplexity and intensity to NCS odor.
However, the nal cool- ing and drying stage causes a severe loss of odor compounds.Therefore, we concluded that shortening the cooling time or reducing the contact area of NCS with air could enrich the odor of the NCS.
