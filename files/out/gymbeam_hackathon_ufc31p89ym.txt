Anoxic ATP depletion in neonatal mice brainstem is prevented by creatine supplementation B Wilken, J M Ramirez, I Probst, D W Richter, F Hanefeld Abstract Background —Su Ycient ATP concentra- tions maintain physiological processesand protect tissue from hypoxic damage.With decreasing oxygen concentration, ATP synthesis relies increasingly on thepresence of phosphocreatine.Aim—The e Vect of exogenously applied creatine on phosphocreatine and ATPconcentrations was studied under controland anoxic conditions.Methods —Pregnant mice were fed orally with creatine monohydrate (2 g/kg bodyweight/day).Brainstem slices from thesemice pups were compared with those from pups of non-creatine supplemented preg- nant mice.Measurements were per-formed under normoxic and anoxic condi-tions.In addition, brainstem slices fromnon-creatine treated mice pups were incu-bated for 3 hours in control artiﬁcial cere-brospinal ﬂuid (CSF) (n = 10) or in artiﬁ-cial CSF containing 200 µM creatine(n = 10).
ATP and phosphocreatine con-tents were determined enzymatically insingle brainstem slices.Results —ATP concentrations were in the same range in all preparations. However,there was a signiﬁcant increase of phos- phocreatine in the brainstems from pups of creatine fed mice when compared withthe brainstems of pups from non-creatinetreated mice or in non-incubated brain-stems of control animals.After 30 minutes anoxia, ATP as well as phosphocreatineconcentrations remained signiﬁcantlyhigher in creatine pretreated slices com-pared with controls.Conclusion —The data indicate that exo- genous application of creatine is e Vective in neuroprotection.(Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed 2000; 82:F224–F227) Keywords: ATP; creatine; phosphocreatine; neuropro- tection The brain is one of the most metabolically active organs and depends on a continuoussupply of energy to stabilise ionic homeostasis, energy consuming biochemical reactions, and physiological processes.
The primary energysource is ATP generated via oxidative phospho-rylation of NADH within mitochondria, 12 which requires a su Ycient oxygen supply. Under hypoxic conditions, ATP is primarily supplemented by the phosphocreatine pool, before anaerobic glycolysis is activated, leading to increased production of lactate and H+.134The hypoxia induced fall of intracellular ATP results in multiple dysfunctions of neurones—for example, failure in Ca2+regulat- ing mechanisms leading to an uncontrolled riseof intracellular Ca 2+and subsequent cell damage.4This explains why survival time of immature rats under anoxic conditions isdirectly correlated with the preservation ofbrain energy stores for regulating ionhomeostasis.5 Previous investigations demonstrated that the exogenous application of creatine increasesthe latency of anoxic depolarisation ofneurones, 6thus prolonging cellular survival and stabilising synaptic transmission within thecentral nervous system.
78Previously, we de- scribed the application of prophylactic supple-mentation of creatine and the e Vects on the synaptic activity of the central respiratory net-work under anoxic conditions. 9Here, we present the changes in phosphocreatine andATP concentrations within the brainstem inmore detail using the identical experimentaldesign.The hypothesis that exogenous supplemen- tation of creatine stabilises ATP concentrations during anoxic conditions through raised phos-phocreatine pools was analysed in an in vitrobrainstem preparation of neonatal mice.Experimental setup ATP and phosphocreatine contents in brain-stem slices obtained from neonatal animals(P2) (n = 60) were determined enzymatically.In a ﬁrst experimental setup, pregnant mice were fed orally with creatine monohydrate(2 g/kg body weight/day) (Sigma, Deisenhofen,Germany) throughout pregnancy (20 ±1 day).
Brainstem slices (600 µM thick) from thesemice pups (n = 10) were compared with thosefrom pups born to non-creatine supplementedpregnant mice (n = 10). Thereafter, mice pupsfrom controls (n = 10) as well as from creatinetreated animals (n = 10) were exposed toanoxia for 30 minutes.In a second series of experiments, brainstem slices from non-creatine treated mice pupswere incubated for three hours in control arti-ﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) (n = 10) or in artiﬁcial CSF containing 200 µM creatine(n = 10).Preparation Technical details of the transverse brainstemslice preparations have been describedpreviously.10The brainstem was isolated in ice cold artiﬁcial CSF and secured in a vibratome with its rostral end directed upwards.
Sliceswere sectioned serially until the rostralArch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed 2000; 82:F224–F227 F224 Klinik für Pädiatrie und Neuropädiatrie,Universität Göttingen,37075 Göttingen,GermanyB WilkenF Hanefeld Institut für Neurophysiologie undSinnesphysiologie,Universität GöttingenD W Richter Institut für Biochemie I, UniversitätGöttingenI Probst Department of Organismal Biologyand Anatomy,University of Chicago,Chicago, Illinois 60637,USAJ M Ramirez Correspondence to:Professor F Hanefeld,University of Göttingen,Pediatric and PediatricNeurology, Robert-Koch-Str.40, 37075 Göttingen,Germany Accepted 22 October 1999 boundary of the so called pre-Bötzinger com- plex became visible. This region is crucial forthe generation of the respiratory rhythm.11The transverse slice (600 µm thickness) containingthe pre-Bötzinger complex is recognisable bycytoarchitectonic landmarks, such as theappearance of the inferior olive and the hypoglossal nucleus, and the disappearance ofthe facial nucleus.
The next slice containingthe pre-Bötzinger complex was transferredinto a recording chamber for electrophysi-ological measurements or was immediatelyhomogenised for biochemical analysis. The preparation was superfused by artiﬁcial CSF (ﬂow rate 10 ml/min) at 29 °C and was continuously gassed with carbogen (95% O 2 and 5% CO2).The artiﬁcial CSF contained 128 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 24 mM NaHCO3, 0.5 mM NaH2PO4, and 30 mM D-glucose, and was equilibrated with carbogen at 27 °C to pH 7.4.Anoxia was induced by gassing the artiﬁcial CSF with 95% N2and 5% CO2over a period of 30 minutes.Biochemical analysis The rationale of the biochemical analysis wasto determine the ATP, ADP, phosphocreatine,and creatine contents of brainstem slices toobtain information about the creatine kinaseregulated transfer of phosphate from phospho-creatine to ADP, which results in de novo pro-duction of ATP.
Immediately after withdrawal from the recording chamber all slices were homogenisedby ultrasound in 250 µl 8% perchloric acid andcentrifuged for 15 minutes at 15 500 g. The supernatant ﬂuid was neutralised by theaddition of KHCO 3and recentrifuged.ATP and phosphocreatine was measured enzymati- cally by adding 30 µl of a 100 mM trieth-anolamin hydrochloride stem solution (con-taining 7 mM MgCl 2, 2 nmol (4 µl of 0.5 mM) NADP solution, 12 nmol ADP (4 µl of 3 mM)solution, 8 nmol glucose (4 µl of 2 mM), and1 µl G6P-DH) to 100 µl of the homogenisedbrainstem slices.12The enzymatic reaction was started with 0.5 µl hexokinase.ATP wasmeasured using a photometer with lightabsorption at 366 nm.After the end of the bio-chemical reaction, 20 µl creatine kinase was added to measure phosphocreatine contents.All ATP and phosphocreatine values are givenin µmol/g wet weight.Signiﬁcant di Verences were determined by the Student’s ttest.
ResultsUsing enzymatic tests, ATP values did not dif-fer signiﬁcantly between normal brainstemslices and those from mice pups of animals supplemented with creatine during pregnancy. Table 1 gives the ATP concentrations.Therewere also no signiﬁcant changes in ATPconcentrations when slices were incubated forthree hours in artiﬁcial CSF or artiﬁcial CSFcontaining 200 µM creatine: mean (SE) ATPconcentrations were 7.2 (0.2) µmol/g in controlslices and 7.5 (0.2) µmol/g in slices incubatedin creatine supplemented artiﬁcial CSF.Bothsets of values were signiﬁcantly lower than inthe group receiving oral supplementation viathe mother animals.After 30 minutes anoxia, there was a 54% decrease in ATP values in neonatal controlslices, whereas there was only an 8% decreasein ATP values in the creatine pretreated slices (p < 0.05) (ﬁg 1).
The mean (SE) phosphocreatine concentra- tion was 0.8 (0.1) µmol/g in control slices andthus signiﬁcantly di Verent from the values found in slices obtained from pups of mother animalsfed with creatine (mean, 1.9; SE, 0.1 µmol/g;p < 0.05).

After 30 minutes anoxia, the mean (SE)phosphocreatine concentration was 1.4(0.1) µmol/g in creatine pretreated slices, whereas the phosphocreatine was almost com-pletely depleted (mean, 0.1; SE, 0.1 µmol/g) incontrol slices (p < 0.05; ﬁg 2).Discussion Using biochemical analysis, we found that oraltreatment of pregnant mother animals withcreatine or incubation of brainstem slices increatine containing artiﬁcial CSF increasedphosphocreatine concentrations and stabilised ATP values during anoxia in brain tissue of neonatal mice.
ATP concentrations were lower,but not signiﬁcantly di Verent, in slices incu- bated for three hours either in normal or increatine containing artiﬁcial CSF. However,phosphocreatine concentrations were signiﬁ-cantly higher after slices were incubated increatine containing artiﬁcial CSF or after theywere incubated in artiﬁcial CSF without creat-ine.ATP concentrations were decreased inboth groups after incubation for three hours.We interpret this ﬁnding to be the result of thelow metabolic activity of slices held at atemperature of 27 °C.After 30 minutes anoxia, ATP was signiﬁ- cantly reduced (54%) in control brainstemslices, while there was only a slight decrease of ATP values (8%) in slices that were pretreatedwith creatine.In addition, phosphocreatine wasonly slightly decreased in creatine pretreatedslices, whereas it was almost completelydepleted after 30 minutes anoxia in control tis-sue.
Physiological processes and life rescuing mechanisms—for example, the highly energydemanding hypoxic augmentation of respira-tory activity, 9depend on a su Ycient energy supply and hence a su Ycient phosphocreatine pool. Under normal conditions, phosphocreat- ine decreases rapidly to 40–50% duringhypoxic conditions, which is accompanied by a comparable fall in ATP values, indicatingfailure of ATP synthesis.13 14Such energy depletion is correlated with the onset of hypoxic depression of the central respiratorynetwork, as Pierard and co-workers 15have shown by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.This neural response can easily be explained bythe blockade of synaptic interaction within thenetwork.15Inhibitory synaptic transmission seems to be more sensitive to hypoxic stress,16 which leads to the danger of excitotoxicity ofexcitatory amino acids.
Excessive excitationcould lead to the massive inﬂux of cations,which can lead to severe damage to neurones.This is particularly threatening to neonatal animals in which compensatory rescue mecha-nisms are underpowered. 17The immature isoform of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor reveals a higher open probability, andits deactivation is slower than that of adultNMDA receptors, resulting in an enhanced Ca 2+inﬂux.17This may be potentiated by a Ca2+ inﬂux through depolarisation activated L-type Ca2+channels.18Immature brain tissue might not be able to cope with such a Ca2+overload.The reason is that creatine kinase is three to sixtimes less active in immature than in matureanimals, which results in a limited energypool.19 20The responsible cellular mechanisms for this observation are summarised in thescheme shown in ﬁg 3.In immature as well as in mature animals, cell death does not occur as long as the ATP content remains above 25% of control.
21This has important clinical implications, because stabili- sation of a su Ycient ATP content could be neu- roprotective. ATP is needed for energy consum-ing processes such as 3Na +/2K+and Ca2+ pumping,22which are the key processes for ionic homeostasis determining neuronal excitabilityand synaptic transmission.Inhibitory and exci-tatory synaptic transmission should also be pro-tected by increasing ATP supply.This is consist- ent with the ﬁnding that preincubation ofneocortical cells with creatine also had apronounced protective e Vect against hypoxic depression of synaptic transmission.72 32 4 In conclusion, our data demonstrate that hypoxic energy failure in neonatal mice can be prevented by exogenous creatine applied be-fore the hypoxic event.From this observation,the working hypothesis is derived that creatine might also be neuroprotective in humans.Figure 3 Schematic illustration of the most essential consequences of ATP stabilisation in neurones.
ATP turnover is enhanced in all cases of hypoxic augmentation of neuronalactivity. Increased ADP production leads to activation of K +outward currents (IK) preferentially ﬂowing through ADP/ATP regulated KATPchannels, and the membrane potential of presynaptic and postsynaptic elements remains negative.ATPases regulateelectrogenic 3Na +/2K+pumping, they control active Ca2+pumping into intracellular organelles, and indirectly ensure e Vective Na+coupled Ca2+transportation across the plasma membrane.Such ATP dependent stabilisation of the membrane potential and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration also protects presynaptic Ca2+inward currents that regulate release of the neurotransmitter glutamate.Unprotected hypoxic enhancement of speciﬁc and non-speciﬁcglutamate release would activate Ca 2+permeable NMDA-type (N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamate receptors, apart from the normally activated Na+permeable AMPA-type glutamate receptors.
Such enhanced Ca2+inﬂux and depressed Ca2+sequestration would lead to further membrane depolarisation and an excitotoxic rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Thus, stabilisation of the ATP pool protects synaptic transmission betweenneurones even during severe hypoxia.AMPA, á-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylinoxazol- propion-acid.Na+ K+ IK KATPADPAMPA NMDA ATP PCr CreatineCa2+ICaICa Ca2+F226 Wilken, Ramirez, Probst, Richter, Hanefeld 1 Vannucci RC.Experimental biology of cerebral hypoxic- ischemia: relation to perinatal brain damage.Pediatr Res 1990; 27:317–26.2 Erecinska M, Silver IA.ATP and brain function.J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 1989; 9:2–19.3 Bessman SP.The creatine–creatine phosphate energy shut- tle.Annu Rev Biochem 1985; 54:831–62.4 Lutz PL.Mechanisms for anoxic survival in the vertebrate brain.Annu Rev Physiol 1992; 4:601–18.5D u Vy TE, Kohle SJ, Vannucci RC.Carbohydrate and energy metabolism in perinatal rat brain: relation to survival in anoxia.J Neurochem 1974; 24:271–6.
