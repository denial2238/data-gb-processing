Thebranches andleaves ofYanshan ginger contain avariety of potent antibacteria lcompound s,such asvolatile oils,phenols, andditerpenoids, which hin- dertheir rapid degradation bymicroorganisms .Inthisstudy, wescreened andconstructed a composite microbial system toprovide atechnical reference forproduction oforganic fertil- izerfrom thebranches andleaves ofYanshan ginger. Methods Acomposite microbial system, “YanShan Jun” (YSJ), wasdeveloped byscreening foreffi- cient detoxification anddegradation ofthebranches andleaves ofYanshan ginger.High- throughput sequencing technology wasused toinvestigate thestability anddiversity ofYSJ subcultures.Theculture conditions forYSJwere optimized bysequential single-factor experiments andresponse surface analysis.Yanshan ginger leaves andbranches were inoculated withYSJtostudy itseffects oncomposting efficiency.Results Themicrobial composition ofYSJwasstable andrichindiversity through continuous sub- culture.
Through response surface analysis, theoptimized culture conditions forYSJwere determined asfollows: peptone 8.0g/L,sodium chloride 9.0g/L,calcium carbonate 5.2g/L, yeast powder 1.6g/L,cultivation temperatu re56.1˚C, andculture duration 6d.Under these conditions, thedegradation rateofYanshan ginger was58.32%, which was14.22% higher than thatbefore optimization.

Inoculation ofYanshan ginger compost withYSJincreased thefermentation temperatu re,prolonged thehigh-temperatur eperiod, andreduced thewater content andpHofthecompost intheearly stage. Conclusions Inoculation ofplant compost withYSJbacteria improves thenutritional environment ofthe compost, promotes thecomposting reaction, promotes therapid formation ofastrong indig- enous microflora, forms abeneficial microecological environment, andincreases thecom- posting efficiency.Thisstudy provides atheoretical basis forpractical application ofYSJfor organic fertilizer production from Yanshan ginger.Introduction Yanshan ginger (Alpiniazerumbet) isaperennial herb that isused asatraditional medicine and spice, and isbeneficial forsoiland water conservation inkarst areas [1].Given thewide- spread utilization ofYanshan ginger inChina and continued expansion oftheplanting area, theissue ofdisposal ofginger waste materials hasbecome problematic.
After theharvest of ginger fruit, itisnecessary tocutoffthebranches toincrease thefruit yield inthefollowing season. Noprevious research onappropriate treatment methods forYanshan ginger branches and leaves hasbeen conducted [2–5].The most effective approach inChina istomix the branches and leaves with livestock and poultry manure tomake bio-organic fertilizer [6].However, thegreatest problem isthat compost fermentation does notproceed smoothly.This isbecause thebranches and leaves ofginger contain volatile oils, phenols, pyrones, flavonoids, diterpenes, and other compounds with strong antibacterial effects [7,8].Therefore, there isa need toconstruct abacterial agent that canquickly detoxify thebranches and leaves ofYan- shan ginger forefficient fermentation and production ofbio-organic fertilizer [9,10].Composite microbial systems consist ofbacteria that canbecultured separately and those that cannot becultured [11].
The bacteria canmaintain growth and metabolic activities under theinhibition ofthebiotoxic substances ofYanshan ginger, and effectively degrade some of thebiotoxic substances and cellulose [12]. Therefore, itisfeasible tosimulate natural condi- tions and exploit theinteraction ofmultiple microorganisms todetoxify thebranches and leaves ofginger [13, 14].Inthisstudy, wescreened and constructed acomposite microbial system, designated “Yan- Shan Jun” (YSJ), with thecapacity todegrade branches and leaves ofYanshan ginger from samples ofpigmanure combined with Yanshan ginger organic fertilizer.The compound microbial agent wasused todetoxify and degrade ginger branches and leaves, and theculture conditions were optimized.Our aim wastoprovide atechnical reference forproduction ofan organic fertilizer from thebranches and leaves ofYanshan ginger incombination with live- stock manure inthefuture [15–17].
Materials andmethods Sample collection and preparation The compound microbial strain YSJwasscreened and isolated from pigmanure–Yanshan gin- gerorganic fertilizer samples. The YSJcompound strains were serially subcultured, and the PLOS ONEStudy onmicrobial diversity, cultivation conditions andapplication effect ofYSJ PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02787 01December 2,2022 2/13University (No.2020YY04).Thefunders hadnorole instudy design, datacollection andanalysis , decision topublish, orpreparation ofthe manuscript.There wasnoadditional external funding received forthisstudy.Competing interests :Theauthors have declared thatnocompeting interests exist.10th, 20th, and 30th generations were designated YSJ10, YSJ20, and YSJ30, respectively.Each treatment wasreplicated three times.DNA extraction Genomic DNA wasextracted from theYSJsamples using theE.Z.N.A.Tissue DNA Kit (Omega, USA).The DNA wasquantified with aNanodrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, USA).
The DNA integrity and sizewasassessed by1%(w/v) agarose gelelectro- phoresis. The DNA samples were stored at−20˚C until further use.Amplicon library preparation and sequencing The bacteria were identified byPCR amplification oftheV3–V4 region ofthe16SrRNA gene, using theprimers 338F (50-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-30)and 806R (50-GGACTACHV GGGTWTCTAAT-30).An8bpbarcode wasadded tothe50end ofthe806R reverse primer for sample differentiation.The reaction volume was50μL,which comprised 27μLddH 2O,2μL (5μM) each oftheforward and reverse primers, 2.5μL(10ng)template DNA, 5μL(2.5 mM) deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 10μLof5×FastPfu buffer, 0.5μLbovine serum albumin, and 1μLTransStart FastPfu Polymerase (TransGen, Beijing, China).The amplification protocol comprised predenaturation at95˚C for5min, followed by30cycles ofdenaturation at94˚C for30s,annealing at55˚C for35s,and elongation at72˚C for30s,with afinal extension step at72˚C for8min.
The PCR products were purified using agelrecovery kit(Life Technologies, USA), and aQubit 3.0fluorometer (Life Technologies) wasused forquantitative analysis. The purified amplicons were pooled inequimolar concentrations, and library-specific sequencing adapters were added with theNEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit(NEB#e7370S/ L)follow- ingthemanufacturer’s instructions.Dual index sequencing ofthepaired-end 250bpreads was performed onanIllumina HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina, SanDiego, CA, USA).Sequence data processing and statistics The rawreads were filtered using Trimmomatic (v0.36) and Pear (v0.9.6) using thedefault parameter values toremove low-quality reads.The duplicated reads were merged using Flash (v1.20).The split_libraries_fastq .pyscript intheQIIME pipeline (v1.8.0) wasused toseparate thedata according tothebarcode atthe50end oftheprimer.
The sequences were filtered and denoised toremove chimeras, after which they were classified using theBayesian method against adatabase derived from theRDP 16SrRNA reference db128. The edited sequences were divided into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at97% similarity using Vsearch (v2.7.1).Representative OTU sequences were denoted bythemost abundant sequences for each OTU.The OTU table wassimplified totheminimum sequence number between samples todirectly compare thealpha and beta diversity values ofeach flora.Optimization ofculture conditions forYSJ The degradation rate ofthebranches and leaves ofginger wasdetermined using theweight lossmethod [18].The amount ofYSJused toinoculate themedium was10%, which wasthen placed inanincubator at50˚C, and onebottle wasremoved every daytomeasure thedegrada- tion rate with three replicates.Foroptimization ofthefermentation temperature, theinoculum amount ofYSJwas10%, thetemperature wassetto45,50,55,and 60˚C with three replicates.
Based ontheoptimal culture conditions, thepeptone and yeast powder inthepeptone cellu- lose medium were replaced with thecorresponding nitrogen sources (peptone, yeast powder, ammonium chloride, and urea), and theremainder ofthecomponents were unchanged.

The remainder ofthecomponents were unchanged and, after inoculation with bacterial liquid, thematerial wasincubated at55˚C and thedegradation rate wasdeter- mined with three replicates. Finally, ina100mLconical flask, weplaced 1gginger straw as thecarbon source, 5gpeptone and 1gyeast powder asthenitrogen source, 2gcalcium car- bonate, and then added 3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,or7.0g/Lsodium chloride.The inoculum amount was10%, themedium wasincubated at55˚C, and thedegradation rate wasdetermined.Response surface optimization experimental design Based onthesingle-factor testresults, three factors that hadasignificant impact onthedegra- dation rate were selected, and theBox–Behnken experimental design wasused tooptimize the three-factor and three-level response surface [19].Statistical analysis Weused acompletely randomized block experimental design.Growth values ofstrains were calculated asthemean ofthree orfour biological replicates pertreatment fortheinvitro tests.
Alldata were subjected toanalysis ofvariance and apost-hoc least significant difference test forcomparison ofthemeans using IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The significance ofdifferences among thegermination data were examined with Student’s t-test with a95% confidence interval and significance level ofp<0.05.Results YSJ microbial community stability and diversity Formicrobial community composition analysis, 16SrRNA sequencing wasconducted.Table 1shows thenumber ofvalid and high-quality sequences obtained foreach YSJsample.The number ofvalid and high-quality sequences intheYSJ30-2 sample wasthesmallest among allsamples.The proportion ofhigh-quality sequences ineach sample wasrelatively high (>96%).This showed that thevalid and high-quality sequences ofallsamples were of high quality and could beused forsubsequent microbial diversity analysis.The lengths ofthe Table 1.16S rRNA sequencing statistics fortheYSJ samples .

AVenn diagram wasgenerated tovisualize thenumber ofshared and unique OTUs forthe YSJ10, YSJ20, and YSJ30 samples (Fig 1B).The results showed that YSJ10, YSJ20, and YSJ30 had1172, 1157, and 1109 OTUs, respectively, with 157OTUs detected inboth YSJ10 and YSJ20, 98OTUs inboth YSJ20 and YSJ30, and 77OTUs inboth YSJ30 and YSJ10.
There were 57,21,and 53OTUs unique toYSJ10, YSJ20, and YSJ30, respectively. Fig1Cshows thedilu- tion curve foreach YSJdetoxification agent sample based ontheSobsindex ofOTU richness.The results showed that most ofthemicroorganisms intheYSJsamples were analyzed and the results accurately reflected thecomposition ofthemicrobial community.Analysis oftheShannon index curves showed that thesamples collected from different sub- cultures differed inthediversity oftheir microbial communities.Asshown inFig1D,thesam- ples ofYSJ30-1, YSJ30-2, and YSJ30-3 hadlowdiversity; thesamples ofYSJ10-1 and YSJ20-1 hadmoderate diversity; and thesamples ofYSJ10-2, YSJ10-3, YSJ20-2, and YSJ20-3 hadhigher diversity.The sample with thehighest diversity wasYSJ20-3 with aShannon index of5.45, whereas thesample with thelowest diversity wasYSJ30-1 with aShannon index of4.67.
Next, weexamined community richness and diversity ofmicrobial ecosystems through alpha diversity analysis (Table 2).The microbial community richness ofthenine samples of YSJwasranked inthefollowing order: YSJ20-3>YSJ10-2>YSJ10-3>YSJ20-1>YSJ10-1> Fig1.YSJ microbial communit ystability and diversity.

The Shannon diversity index ofthemicrobial com- munities inthenine samples wasranked asfollows: YSJ20-3>YSJ10-3>YSJ10-2>YSJ20-2 >YSJ10-1, and YSJ20-1>YSJ30-3>YSJ30-1>YSJ30-3. The Simpson diversity index ofthe microbial communities wasranked asfollows: YSJ10-1, YSJ10-2, YSJ10-3, YSJ20-2, YSJ20-3> YSJ20-1>YSJ30-1, YSJ30-2, YSJ30-3.Bysynthesizing therankings fortheShannon diversity index and Simpson diversity index, thediversity ofthemicrobial communities inthenine samples followed theorder YSJ20-3>YSJ10-3>YSJ10-2>YSJ20-2>YSJ10-1>YSJ20-1> YSJ30-3>YSJ30-1>YSJ30-3.Based ontheresults ofthebacterial microbial diversity analysis ofthenine YSJsamples, dif- ferences inbacterial diversity were observed insamples from different culture generations.For bacterial α-diversity intheYSJ20-3 sample, themicrobial chao1 index and Shannon index were thehighest among thenine samples, and thenumber ofOTUs wasalso thelargest.
The YSJ20-3 sample hadthelargest number ofbacterial species and thehighest abundance among allsamples. FortheYSJ30-1 sample, thechao1 index and Shannon index were thelowest among thenine samples, and theleast number ofOTUs wasdetected.Thus, theYSJ30-1 sam- plehadtheleast number ofbacteria and thelowest abundance.Taxonomy-based comparison ofYSJ samples atthegenus level Overall microbiota compositions ofthe23most abundant bacterial genera detected inthe nine YSJsamples areshown inFig2A.The average relative abundance ofeight bacterial genera wasgreater than 1%,namely unidentified Methylococcaceae (2.51%–23.7%), Pusillimonas (6.92%–15.4%), unidentified MBA03 (4.36%–21.4%), Lutispora (8.5%–12.3%), Ruminiclostri- dium (0.95%–14.4%), unidentified BSA1B-03 (2.31%–3.61%), unidentified Clostridia (1.22%– 5.19%), and unidentified NB1-n (1.37%–2.44%).The bacterial genera inthesamples collected from different subcultures were notably different.
Among thethree samples ofYSJ10, themicroorganism with thehighest relative abundance (21.4%, 16.1%, and17.2%, respectively) wasunidentified MBA03. Among thethree samples of YSJ20, themicroorganism with thehighest relative abundance (23.7%, 20.5%, and19.7%, respectively) wasunidentified Methylococcaceae.Among thethree samples ofYSJ30, themicro- organism with thehighest relative abundance (25.3%, 25.1%, and24.4%, respectively) wasHalo- plasma.Therefore, differences were observed inthedominant microorganisms atthegenus level intheYSJsamples collected from different subcultures.Lutispora wasdetected inallnine samples with relative abundance of8.5%–12.3%, indicating that thisgenus played arole throughout theprocess ofdegradation ofYanshan ginger straw.This finding wasconsistent with theresults ofJiang etal.inastudy ofcellulose degradation bycomposite bacteria [20].Table 2.Alpha diversity index statistics fortheYSJ samples.

Tovisualize theinformation fortheYSJsamples, weperformed aheatmap analysis (Fig 2B). Differences inthecomposition and relative abundance ofthedominant bacterial species intheYSJsamples were apparent.Wefurther explored theco-occurrence patterns bynetwork inference based onsignificant and strong correlations using thenonparametric Spearman’s rank correlation analysis [22].Correlation networks ofco-occurring microbes allow visual summarization oflarge amounts ofinformation [23].The resulting YSJmicrobial network (Fig 2C)consisted of19nodes (i.e., OTUs).The co-occurring microorganisms belonged totheFirmicutes, Planctomycetes, Pro- teobacteria, Tenericates, and Gemmatimonadetes.There wasapositive correlation between theunidentified Methylococcaceae genus and Vulgatibacter, indicating that thetwogenera were highly correlated.The unidentified genus MAB03 waspositively correlated withVulgatibacter.
The unidentified genera MAB03 and AKYG587, and Limnochordaceae and AKYG587 showed positive correlations. Optimization ofYSJ culture conditions The degradation rate ofYanshan ginger straw byYSJshowed anincreasing trend with exten- sion oftheculture duration, peaking onthe6thdayand thereafter gradually leveling off(Fig 3A).The final degradation rate was53.48%.These results indicated that YSJshowed good abil- ityfordegradation ofbranches and leaves ofYanshan ginger.Different microorganisms have different optimal temperatures forgrowth.According to thesingle-factor testresults (Fig 3B), theculture temperature hadasignificant effect onthe degradation ability ofYSJintherange of45–60˚C (p�0.05).The degradation rate ofYanshan Fig3.Optimiza tion ofYSJ culture condition s.(A)The effect ofculture duration ondegradation ability ofYSJ.(B)The effect ofculture temperature onthedegradati onability ofYSJ(p�0.05).(C)Effect ofcarbon source addition onYSJdegradation ability (p�0.05).

Fig3Cshows that YSJcould degrade different amounts ofYanshan ginger straw. The degradation rate gradually decreased with increased amount ofginger straw, which may be caused bythebioactive substances contained inginger having aninhibitory effect onYSJ.Addition ofginger material attherate of10g/Lresulted inthehighest decomposition rate (52.33%).Based onthetestresults fornitrogen sources, peptone +yeast extract powder (ratio of5:1) wasselected asthenitrogen source.From Fig3D,theamount ofnitrogen source hadasignifi- cant effect onthedegradation ability ofYSJ(p�0.05).When thenitrogen source quantity was 9.0g/L, thedegradation rate wasthehighest (52.67%).Inorganic salts areindispensable nutrients formicroorganisms and affect their growth and metabolism.Addition ofsodium chloride attherate of7g/Lresulted inthemaximum degra- dation rate of49.45% (Fig 3E).The single-factor test(Fig 3F)showed that calcium carbonate hadasignificant effect onthedegradation ability ofYSJ(p�0.05).
The degradation rate improved with increase incalcium carbonate addition from 0.5to5.0g/L, and thepeak value of54.65% wasattained at5.0g/L. Response surface analysis Based ontheregression equation, theinteraction effects ofthevariables temperature (Fig 4A), calcium carbonate addition (Fig 4B), and nitrogen source addition (Fig 4C)onthedegradation rate ofYanshan ginger byYSJwere analyzed bygenerating athree-dimensional response sur- face plot.Interactions between variables aresignificant when thecontour plot iselliptical rather than circular.Otherwise, theinteraction istrivial.Furthermore, therange ofthevari- ables issetreasonably when theshape oftheresponse surface isconvex [24].With theincrease inculture temperature and calcium carbonate addition, thedegradation ofYanshan ginger rose initially and then decreased when thenitrogen source addition was fixed.
The contour linewasslightly elliptical and theresponse surface wasconvex, revealing that culture temperature and calcium carbonate showed astrong interaction. With theaddition ofcalcium carbonate atafixed amount, thedegradation rate rose initially and then decreased with theincrease innitrogen source addition and culture temperature.At atemperature of53–58˚C, thedegradation rate hasanextreme value.When theculture temperature wasfixed, thedegradation ofYanshan ginger initially increased and then decreased with increase incalcium carbonate and nitrogen source Table 3.Effect ofnitrogen sources onthedegradat ionability ofYSJ.

The response surface wasconvex and thecontour linewasslightly elliptical, revealing that thetwovariables showed astrong interaction and amaximum value.The derived polynomial equation wasanalyzed with Design-Expert 10software, and the optimal culture conditions were determined asfollows: culture temperature 56.063˚C, calcium carbonate addition 5.241 g/L, and nitrogen source addition 9.746 g/L.Under these conditions, thepredicted percentage ofYanshan ginger degradation was58.768%.
Tofacilitate thepractical operation, theculture conditions forYSJwere revised based on thetheoretical values asfollows: peptone 8.0g/L, sodium chloride 9.0g/L, calcium carbonate 5.2g/L, yeast powder 1.6g/L, cellulose (Yanshan ginger branches and leaves) 10.0 g/L, culture temperature 56.1˚C, and culture duration 6d.Under these optimal conditions, thedegrada- tion rate forginger was58.32%, which wasconsistent with thevalue predicted bythemodel (58.768%) and represented anincrease of14.22% compared with that achieved before optimization. Effects ofYSJ inoculation oncomposting ofYanshan ginger Inoculation with YSJsignificantly increased thefermentation temperature intheearly stage of composting, attaining 52˚C onthethird dayoffermentation, whereas thetemperature inthe control check (CK) attained 51.5˚C ontheseventh day(Fig 5A).
The high-temperature period under YSJtreatment wassignificantly longer than that oftheCK, possibly caused bytherapid degradation byYSJoftheactive substances inginger that inhibit thegrowth ofmicroorganisms.

Attheend ofcomposting, thepHwas7.72 and 7.86, respectively.During theentire composting process, thepHoftheYSJtreatment wascon- sistently lower than that oftheCK.Intheearly stage offermentation, desiccation ofthecompost inoculated with YSJwas greater than that oftheCK(Fig 5C).The moisture content ofthecompost inoculated with YSJ waslower than that oftheCKthroughout theprocess ofcompost fermentation.
Discussion Yanshan ginger iscultivated asaspice and thebranches and leaves contain antibacterial sub- stances, such ascarvacrol, diethyldimethyl lead, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, and borneol [25, 26], which arenotconducive toorganic fertilizer composting and utilization. The construction of thecompound bacterial agent YSJand optimization oftheculture conditions provides afoun- dation fortheproduction oforganic fertilizer derived from Yanshan ginger.From thesingle-factor experiment and response surface analysis, weobserved that thecul- ture temperature, calcium carbonate addition, and nitrogen source addition have thegreatest influence ontheability ofYSJtodegrade Yanshan ginger branches and leaves.
Wedetermined theoptimized culture conditions ofYSJtobeasfollows: peptone 8.0g/L, sodium chloride 9.0 g/L, calcium carbonate 5.2g/L, yeast powder 1.6g/L, Yanshan ginger branches and leaves 10.0 g/L, incubation temperature 56.1˚C, and incubation duration 6d.Under thisoptimal condi- tion, thepercentage degradation rate ofginger was58.32%, anincrease of14.22% compared with that oftheCK, and consistent with themodel-predicted value (58.768%). Owing tolimited time, inthesingle-factor experiment forselection and optimization ofthe nitrogen source and inorganic salts inthemedium, although alarge number ofstudies were reviewed, easier-to-use and lower-cost rawmaterials could beselected when combined with thepossibility ofexpanding production inthefuture [27–29].Inaddition, theproduction of organic fertilizer bycomposting Yanshan ginger branches and leaves incombination with live- stock manure requires further research.
The present study ofmicrobial diversity, especially bacteria and fungi inYSJ, hasthepotential torecognize complex ecosystems ofmicrobe–gin- gerand microbe–microbe interactions. The major bacterial and fungal genera identified inthe YSJsamples have potential forexploration into their useasbiological degradation agents.Conclusions The current study confirmed that inoculation ofYanshan ginger branches and leaves with the compound microbial system YSJincreases thefermentation temperature ofthecompost, pro- longs thehigh-temperature period, and reduces themoisture content and pHofthecompost intheinitial stage after inoculation.The improvement ofthese keyindices isimportant to improve theefficiency ofcomposting.Inaddition, weexplored themicrobial composition of YSJusing high-throughput sequencing technology, and confirmed that themicrobial commu- nity wasrelatively stable and easily subcultured.
Weoptimized thefermentation conditions for YSJinoculation ofYanshan ginger composting and increased thedegradation ofYanshan gin- gerby14.22%. These experimental results provide asound theoretical basis forthepractical application ofYSJ.Acknowledgmen ts Weexpress ourgratitude totheBeijing Genecome Medical Technology Co., Ltd., China, for assistance with data analysis and sequencing.PLOS ONEStudy onmicrobial diversity, cultivation conditions andapplication effect ofYSJ PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02787 01December 2,2022 11/13 Author Contributions Conceptualization: Wenhao Chen.Formal analysis: Wenhao Chen, Juan Li.Funding acquisition: Wenhao Chen, Huawei Yuan.Methodology: Wenhao Chen.Software: Wenhao Chen, Juan Li.Visualization: Ling You, Tao Wang, Zongjin Cao.Writing –original draft: Wenhao Chen, Juan Li,Huawei Yuan, Ling You, Tao Wang, Zong- jinCao.Writing –review &editing: Wenhao Chen.
