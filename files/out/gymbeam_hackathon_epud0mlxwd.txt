Email: h.shirzadi@ilam.ac.ir PLANT COLLECTION: Sumac ( Rhus coriaria ) fruit and Syrian mesquite (Prosopis farcta ) root samples were gathered in August from Shazand (Markazi province, Iran; latitude: 33◦48′49.54 ″N; longitude: 49◦19′43.71 ″E; altitude: 2278 m) and Gilan-e Gharb (Kermanshah province, Iran; latitude: 34◦05′00.02 ″N; longitude: 45◦53′57.05 ″E; altitude: 939 m) countryside, respectively. Funding information T arbiat Modares University, Grant/Award Number: 8930182003Abstract Background: Our hypothesis centred on the potential to mitigate ascites outbreaks in birds exposed to cold stress by inhibiting pulmonary artery contraction through dietary intervention.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of natural and synthetic med- ications on growth performance, ascites-related parameters and the expression of ascites-related genes in the lung tissue of broiler chickens under low ambient temperature.
Methods: We randomly assigned 450 one-day-old male Ross 308 chicks to six dietary treatments across five replicate pens, each containing 15 chicks. The treatments included a basal diet (control), and the basal diet was supplemented with hydroal- coholic extracts of sumac (HES, 200 mg/kg), Syrian mesquite (HEM, 200 mg/kg), L-arginine (40% above requirement), captopril (15 mg/kg) and vitamin E (100 mg/kg).Results: Diets containing HEM, L-arginine and vitamin E resulted in increased average daily gain on days 8–14 and 0–28, whereas HES showed a similar effect only dur- ing days 8–14 compared to the control diet ( p<0.05).Additionally, feed additives decreased packed cell volume, left and right ventricle volumes and systolic blood pres- sure ( p<0.05).Moreover, chickens fed the control and L-arginine diets exhibited higher levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA in lung tissue compared to those fed HES, HEM and captopril ( p<0.05).
Meanwhile, supplementation with HEM and L- arginine increased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA in This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes. © 2024 The Author(s).Veterinary Medicine and Science published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Vet Med Sci.2024;10:e1542.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/vms3 1o f1 1 https://doi.org/10.1002/vms3.1542 2o f1 1 SHIRZADI ET AL .lung tissue compared to other treatments ( p<0.05).Regarding Cu/Zn-superoxide dis- mutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) expression, feed additives increased mRNA level in lung tissue, except for captopril ( p<0.05).
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the plant extracts may reduce the inci- dence of ascites syndrome not only through their antioxidant properties but also by modulating the expression of ACE, iNOS and Cu/Zn-SOD genes. KEYWORDS hypertrophy, L-arginine, pulmonary hypertension, vasodilator, vitamin E 1 INTRODUCTION Ascites syndrome, also known as pulmonary arterial hypertension syn- drome, is significant metabolic disorder in avian species, leading to substantial economic losses in the poultry industry (Leeson, 2007 ).Mortality rates associated with ascites can range from 5% to 8% across different populations, with even higher of 20%–30% reported in rooster flocks (Closter et al., 2009 ).The impact of these losses on the poultry industry is underscored by annual rearing of approximately 9 billion broilers in the United States alone (Rama et al., 2022 ).
Ascites outbreaks are influenced by various factors, including genetic, environ- mental (particularly cold stress, which we induced to trigger ascites), nutritional and physiological factors, diseases and toxins, all of which elevate the demand for oxygen. This metabolic disorder predominantly affects fast-growing broilers (Guo et al., 2023 ), with hypoxia or any condition increasing oxygen demands, such as cold stress (Sijun et al., 2002 ).Numerous pharmaceutical and nutritional interventions have been suggested for controlling ascites, including furosemide, vitamin C and E, selenium, arginine, medicinal plants, skip-a-day feeding, limiting access to feed, low calorie diets and more (Gupta, 2011 ).We hypothesized that through dietary manipulation to inhibit the contraction of pulmonary artery, we could potentially alleviate the out- break of ascites in birds facing cold stress.
Previous research indicates the involvement of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in artery contraction. It is known that the conversion of angiotensin (Ang) I into the physiologically active form, Ang II, is catalysed by ACE in lung tissue Ang II, within lung tissue.Ang II is recognized as a potent vasoconstrictor capable of induc- ing hypertension by enhancing sympathetic nervous system activity, vasoconstriction, and aldosterone secretion (Balasuriya & Rupasinghe, 2011 ).Moreover, it is reported that oxidation of arginine by iNOS gen- erates NO, a powerful pulmonary vasodilator (Asadollahi et al., 2014 ).Wideman et al.( 1995 ) suggested supplementation of L-arginine at levels exceeding those necessary of optimal growth performance is essential as a precursor for NO production in broilers.
Therefore, targeting the inhibition of ACE and stimulation iNOS genes expression appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy for controlling hypertension and, consequently, ascites. Previous studieshave demonstrated that flavonoids and proanthocyanidins have ACE inhibitory activities (Balasuriya & Rupasinghe, 2011 ; Wu et al., 2023 ) and iNOS stimulatory activities (Asadollahi et al., 2014 ).For instance, Häckl et al.( 2002 ) investigated the inhibitory effect of quercetin on the ACE activity and results have shown that this flavonoid can have a ther- apeutic effect similar to captopril (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl- L-proline) as an ACE inhibitor (Abd Alla et al., 2013 ; Häckl et al., 2002 ).On the other hand, reactive oxygen species have been implicated to induce lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress by depleting antiox- idant reserves in tissues, which in turn can increase the outbreak of ascites syndrome (Wideman et al., 1995 ).
The efficacy of vitamin E and plant-derived flavonoids as free radical scavengers has been well established in numerous researches (Lu et al., 2023 ; T ang et al., 2023 ). It appears that modulating the expression levels of ACE and iNOS could be a promising approach for controlling ascites syndrome.How- ever, based on our knowledge of previous studies on ascites syndrome, limited research has been conducted to evaluate the expression of iNOS, and none has assessed the expression of ACE gene.Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of two plant extracts, along with L-arginine and captopril, as modulators of ascites-related genes expression as well as vitamin E as an antioxidant additive, in broiler chickens exposed to cold stress.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Plant extract preparation Sumac ( Rhus coriaria ) fruit and Syrian mesquite ( Prosopis farcta ) root were gathered, shade dried and ground.
Aqueous acetone 70% (v/v) extraction was performed on each plant material (Kossah et al., 2010 ) followed by phytochemical analysis of the extracts (sumac and Syrian mesquite, respectively) was performed for detection of total pheno- lic compounds using the Folin–Ciocalteu method, with concentration of 224.5 mg tannic acid equivalents/g dried extract for sumac and 171.2 mg tannic acid equivalents/g dried extract as described by Lucas et al. ( 2022 ).Furthermore, the content of total tannin (44.86% vs.37.64% of dried extract) and gallic acid (3.32% vs.5.97% of dried SHIRZADI ET AL .3o f1 1 extract) was analysed by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method (Saltan et al., 2019 ; Silva et al., 2023 ).The concentration of total flavonoid compounds was determined using the colorimetric method as described by Orsavová et al.( 2023 ), with concentration of 45.82 vs.63.69 mg quercetin equivalents/g dried extract.
Additionally, the concentrations of the specific flavonoids, including luteolin (22.45% vs. 10.93% of dried extract), apigenin (1.72% vs.5.64% of dried extract), rutin (8.29% vs.14.38% of dried extract) and quercetin (38.51% vs.50.24% of dried extract), were individually assessed using the HPLC method (Mehrdad et al., 2009 ; Permana et al., 2023 ).2.2 Birds and diets A total of 450 one-day-old male Ross 308 chicks were randomly allocated to six dietary treatments, with each treatment having five replicate pens and each pen containing 15 chicks.The average initial body weight of chicks per pen was 44 g.The experimental period spanned 28 days and was divided into a starter phase (days 0–10) and a grower phases (days 11–28).During the first 3 days of trial, the room temperature was maintained at 32◦C.Subsequently, the temperature gradually decreased to 14◦C by the 21st day of the experiment with a reduction of one degree per day facilitated by a thermostat.
The temperature remained constant at 14◦C until day 28 (Wang et al., 2018 ). The chicks were reared in floor pens (2 ×1×1.2 m3), and the lighting schedule was implemented as follows: 24 h of light per day for the initial 3 days, which was then reduced to 18 h of light and 6 h of darkness.The diets were formulated to meet the nutrient recommendation outlined in the Ross 308 manual.From the first day, the chicks were fed through a basal diet based on corn and soybean meal (as con- trol) or the basal diet supplemented with specific additives.These additives included hydroalcoholic extract of sumac (HES, 200 mg/kg), hydroalcoholic extract of Syrian mesquite (HEM, 200 mg/kg), L- arginine (40% above requirement (Ghamari Monavvar et al., 2020 ; Zampiga et al., 2019 )), vitamin E (100 mg/kg) and captopril (15 mg/kg), respectively.Both water and mash feed were provided ad libitum.Ta b l e 1presents the ingredients and chemical compositions of basal diets.
2.3 Growth performance At the ages of 7, 14, 21 and 28 days, following an 8 h feed with- drawal period, broiler chickens in each pen were weighed, and weekly feed consumption was measured (per pen basis) to calculate average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed efficiency (FE).The performance data were adjusted for any mortalities moni- tored throughout the experiment. Clinical signs and mortalities related to ascites were closely monitored throughout the experiment.Addi- tionally, all deceased birds during the rearing period were dissected to diagnose ascites.TABLE 1 Ingredients and chemical compositions of the basal diets.

2.4 Ascites-related parameters At the end of the experiment (day 28 of age), three randomly selected birds were chosen from each pen (Total n=15/treatment) to mea- sure systolic blood pressure (SBP) using the brachial artery via the Lichtenberger method (Lichtenberger, 2005 ), with a sphygmomanome- ter (Riester, no. 1440 Babyphon), pediatric cuff (Nylon-Velcyro, infant circumference 7.5–13 cm), ultrasound transmission gel (Polygel) and vascular flow detector (SONICAID, BV102R) equipped with a 5.5 MHz probe.Subsequently, 4 mL blood samples were collected from the wing vein of these birds using heparinized syringes (Zhejiang Oujian Med- ical Apparatus Co., Ltd.).The blood samples were carefully sucked in to microhaematocrit capillary tubes and then centrifuged at 15,500 ×g for 5 min to determine the packed cell volume (PCV) percentage (Rajani et al., 2011 ).
In addition, whole blood samples were diluted 1:200 in Natt and Herrick’s solution, and then red blood cells (RBCs) were counted using a haemocytometer chamber (Maxwell et al., 1986 ). Erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF), considered a criterion for RBC membrane flu- idity, was measured in whole bloods samples using Dacie’s method (Buffenstein et al., 2001 ), with slight modifications and a microplate 4o f1 1 SHIRZADI ET AL .TABLE 2 Specific primers used for real-time PCR.

The ratio of RV to total ventricular (TV) weight (RV:TV, where TV =LV+RV) was calculated (Guo et al., 2023 ). 2.5 Ascites-related genes expression in lung tissue 2.5.1 RNA and cDNA preparation Following the experiment (day 28 of age), two birds per pen (n=10/treatment) were randomly selected and slaughtered.Subse- quently, the total RNA was extracted from each of the lung tissue samples and isolated (100 mg/each sample) using TRIzol reagent (Invit- rogen Gibco-BRL), based on the manufacturer’s protocol.To enhance RNA purity, any remaining DNA was digested by DNAase I enzyme (Fermentas, Thermo Fisher Scientific).The purity and concentration of RNA samples were determined by measuring the optical density at 260 nm and calculating the OD260/OD280 ratio using a spectropho- tometer (Genova MK3 UV/visible spectrophotometer, Jenway Ltd.).The calculated ratio for the extracted samples fell within the range of 1.95–2.05, indicating satisfactory RNA purity.
All samples were subsequently stored in a −80◦C freezer until further analysis. The next step involved the reverse transcription of the total RNA into a single stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis using M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase enzyme (Vivantis) following the man- ufacturer’s instructions.The reactions were carried out under the following conditions: 65◦C for 5 min for mRNA denaturation, 42◦C for 60 min for cDNA synthesis and 85◦C for 5 min for enzyme inac- tivation.Subsequently, the solutions were chilled on ice and briefly centrifuged to collect the content.Finally, the synthesized cDNA prod- ucts were stored at −20◦C for subsequent use in real-time PCR analysis (El-Shobokshy et al., 2024 ).2.5.2 Real-time PCR of selected genes A relative quantitative real-time PCR technique was employed to quantitatively detect gene expression levels of ACE, iNOS, Cu/Zn- superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Primer pairs for the relevant genes were designed using Allele ID v7.5 software and the specificity of the primers regarding their binding to the cDNA template was ensured through the primer BLAST procedure (T able 2). All reactions were carried out in 25-μL volumes in triplicate using MiniOpticon system (Bio-Rad Labo- ratories, Inc.).Each reaction mixture contained 1–2 μL cDNA, 0.5–1 μL per each primer pairs (forward and reverse; 10 μmol/μL), 7.0μL ddH 2O, 2.5μL5×HQ buffer and 12.5 μL2×PCR Mix (Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems).The PCR cycling conditions began with an initial denaturation step at 95◦C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 95◦C for 10 s, and annealing/extending at 60◦C for 1 min.Melting curve analysis and running the amplicons on agarose gels (in contrast to 100 bp DNA ladder marker; Promega) were per- formed to the determine the specificity of each PCR product.
Negative controls (water replacing DNA) were also included on the agarose gel. Finally, the relative mRNA expression levels for the target genes were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCtmethod, where ΔΔCT represents the sub- traction of [CT gene–C T GAPDH ](Sample) from [CT gene–C T GAPDH ](Control) (Pasri et al., 2024 ).2.6 Statistical analysis The data were analysed using one-way ANOVA through PROC GLM procedure (SAS Institute, 2002 ) as a completely randomized design experiment.Pen was considered the experimental unit for perfor- mance parameters, whereas the average of three birds in each pen served as the experimental unit for SBP, PCV, RBCs, EOF, RV:TV ratio and gene expression parameters.Following ANOVA, Duncan’s multi- ple comparison test was conducted to assess the difference between the treatment means, and statistical significance was declared at a significance level of p≤0.05.SHIRZADI ET AL .

This trend persisted throughout the entire experimental period, except with HES. Additionally, the mortality rate significantly decreased with the supplementation of feed additive.3.2 Ascites-related parameters As shown in T able 4, the findings of this study revealed that supple- menting with feed additive did not significant influence on RBCs and EOF; however, PCV, RV:TV and SBP were significantly decreased ingroups treated with feed additive.Moreover, birds fed diets containing HEM and captopril exhibited a lower RV:TV compared to those fed the L-arginine ( p<0.05).Additionally, in contrast to vitamin E, the inclusion of HEM in the diet resulted in lower SBP in broilers ( p<0.05).3.3 Ascites-related genes expression in lung tissue The results of gene expression analysis (Figure 1a–c ) indicate that the inclusion of HES, HEM and captopril in the diet led to a reduction in the expression level of the ACE in the lungs of broiler chickens (p<0.05; Figure 1a).
Furthermore, broilers fed vitamin E exhibited a lower ACE mRNA level in lung tissue compared to those fed L-arginine (p<0.05). Moreover, the mRNA level of iNOS experienced a significant increase with the addition of HEM and L-arginine, compared to other treatments ( p<0.05; Figure 1b).Although no statistically significant difference was observed between the control, HES, vitamin E and 6o f1 1 SHIRZADI ET AL .TABLE 4 Effect of experimental treatments on parameters related to haematology and ascites in broiler chickens challenged with cold stress.

7o f1 1 tannins. This finding aligns with the result of study conducted by Hashemi et al.( 2012 ), which reported that supplementing the basal diet with Euphorbia hirta plant may lead to an increase in the ADG in broiler.E.hirta plant contains significant quantities of flavonoids and phenolic compounds, including quercetin and gallic acid (Bigoniya et al., 2013 ) with antibacterial activities (Rayne & Mazza, 2007 ), sim- ilar to the components isolated from the two plant extracts used in the current study.Plant extracts are known to have a potent effect on reducing enteropathogens (Manso et al., 2021 ; Rayne & Mazza, 2007 ; Singh et al., 2023 ).The reduction in enteropathogenic bacteria leads to beneficial alterations in intestinal mucosal architecture, resulting in increased in digestibility of ileal nutrients and, consequently, increased body weight (Sarrami et al., 2022 ).
Additionally, the improvements in ADG observed with L-arginine supplementation may be attributed to enhancements in intestinal histomorphology. Khajali et al.( 2014 ) reported that supplementing broiler diet with L-arginine results in improvements in the struc- ture of the intestinal brush border such as increased villi height and width.These changes can enhance digestibility, consequently improv- ing broiler performance.Moreover, administrating arginine as in ovo has been shown to improve jejunal digestive and absorptive activities in neonatal turkey poults (Foye et al., 2007 ).Indeed, alterations in gut histomorphology can be linked to changes in the composition of the gut microbial (Saki et al., 2017 ), suggesting that the enhancement of mucosal architecture may be related to the antimicrobial activity of arginine.NO, produced as a result of the oxidation of arginine (Chen et al., 2022 ), is a potent antimicrobial molecule (Cela et al., 2023 ;Q i et al., 2023 ).
Furthermore, the lack of influence of HES on ADG throughout the entire experiment period (days 0–28) may be related to its lower con- tent of total flavonoid compounds compared to HEM (45.82 against 63.69 mg/g of the dried extract, as mentioned earlier). It can be speculated that the secondary metabolites of HES at a 200 mg/kg con- centration in the diet were not adequate enough to make significant contact with intestinal microbiota.Therefore, to enhance the perfor- mance of broiler chickens with HES as a potential substitute for AGPs in their diets, a higher concentration may be required.Dietary supplementation of vitamin E significantly increased ADG.
Vitamin E acts as a cell membrane antioxidant, protecting the integrity of pulmonary endothelial and other cells by preventing lipid peroxida- tion of lipoproteins through modulation gene expression involved in lipids metabolism (Englmaierová et al., 2011 ), It serves as a protective system against oxidative stress (Bautista-Ortega & Ruiz-Feria, 2010 ). Cold stress can induce oxidative stress (Wei et al., 2023 ) and vitamin E scavenging free radicals (Elgendey et al., 2022 ).Therefore, due to the fact that birds reared in present study were suffering from cold stress as an oxidative stress model, increased ADG may be as a result of enhancements in the immune system and protection of cell membranes against oxidation caused by free radicals, especially enterocytes, which play an important role in improvement of broiler chickens perfor- mance.
Furthermore, increased ADG may be because of increased nutrient digestibility, as vitamin E has been reported to increase fat digestibility (Brenes et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, the decreased mortal-ity rate associated with feed additives could be due to improvements in the cardiovascular system, which will be discussed in more detail later.As the number of RBCs was not affected by dietary supplementa- tion, the decreased PCV caused by feed additives cannot reasonably be attributed to the reduction of synthesis or the increased degrada- tion of RBCs.Therefore, the significant difference in PCV observed in the treated groups compared to the control is likely due to an increase in the blood viscosity in the control group as a result of plasma leak- age into the abdomen cavity.This phenomenon leads to an increase in RBC:plasma ratio, thereby causing the observed difference between broiler chickens fed the control diet and those fed the treated diets.
Moreover, as previously reported, the RV:TV ratio was decreased by the treated diets. The reduction in RV:TV ratio may be the result of the feed additives effects on modulating ascites-related genes expres- s i o n( s u c ha sA C Ea n di N O Sa ss e e ni nF i g u r e 1a,b), thereby facilitating blood flow.Consequently, this reduction in blood flow may alleviate the additional burden on the RV and subsequently prevent its hypertrophy.In addition, the decreased SBP observed in the treated groups may be attributed to reduced blood viscosity compared to the control group, as evidenced by the lower PCV (T able 4).However, it has been shown that diet supplementation with L-arginine reduces pulmonary arterial pressure and the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in broiler chickens having exposed to low ambient temperature (Wide- man et al., 1995 ).Mitani et al.
( 1997 ) have found that L-arginine improves chronic pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular remodelling in rats by altering endogenous NO production. Indeed, NO is a potent pulmonary vasodilator that can signifi- cantly reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and thereby prevent the outbreak of pulmonary hypertension (Wideman & Chapman, 2004 ).Studies have also shown that NO directly decreases pulmonary vas- cular resistance and modulates the release of serotonin, thromboxane and endothelin-1 (Bowen et al., 2007 ; Wideman & Chapman, 2004 ; Wideman et al., 2006 ).Therefore, the regulatory effect of NO on blood pressure is likely due to its ability to inhibit the synthesis or release of key vasoconstrictors, including serotonin, thromboxane and endothelin-1 (Bowen et al., 2007 ).
Furthermore, another reason for the decreased SBP in broiler chick- ens fed HEM may be related to the modulation of the ascites-related genes expression, such as increased iNOS or decreased ACE (as seen in Figure 1a,b). iNOS, through the generation of NO, which is a vasodilator molecule (Liao et al., 2019 ), and ACE by inhibition of Ang II, a vaso- constrictor peptide hormone (Stoll et al., 2019 ), can reduce pulmonary arterials resistance against bloodstream and decrease SBP by improv- ing blood flow.Similarly, the reduction in SBP caused by feeding HES and captopril may also be due to a decrease in ACE gene expression.As mentioned earlier, ACE is an enzyme that catalyses the conversion Ang I to Ang II.The latter is a potent vasoconstrictor that can induce hyper- tension; hence, ACE downregulation can decrease Ang II concentration and consequently lead to a reduction in SBP.
Cold ambient temperatures trigger an elevation in T3 concentra- tion, a hormone crucial for generating additional metabolic heat nec- essary to uphold body temperature in colder environments. This surge in metabolic rate prompts an elevation in blood pressure as the heart 8o f1 1 SHIRZADI ET AL .endeavours to supply adequate oxygen to the organs and muscles, ulti- mately leading to pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular strain (Gupta, 2011 ).Cold stress has been shown to induce oxidative stress (Wei et al., 2023 ), which, alongside lipid peroxidation, has been implicated to induce ascites syndrome.However, antioxidant materials can prevent the outbreak (Rajani et al., 2011 ).Conversely, oxidative stress has also been implicated in the development of pulmonary hypertension (Poy- atos et al., 2023 ).
Therefore, vitamin E, acting as an antioxidant, may help prevent the initiation of oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thus potentially explaining its role in reducing SBP. Additionally, unlike vitamin E, the inclusion of HEM in the diet resulted in lower SBP in broiler chickens.SBP is evidently one of the most common signs of ascites syndrome.Hence, the reduction in SBP attributed to the inclusion of HEM in the diet could be linked to the heightened efficacy of secondary metabolites of HEM in preventing ascites syndrome.These metabolites not only enhance antioxidant activities by upregulation of Cu/Zn-SOD gene but also lead to mod- ulation of ACE and iNOS genes.Modulation of ACE and iNOS genes can prevent right ventricular hypertrophy due to ascites syndrome via inhibition of Ang conversion I into Ang II (as a vasoconstrictor) (Stoll et al., 2019 ) and production of NO as a vasodilator molecule (Liao et al., 2019 ).
Furthermore, a reduction in erythrocyte deformability has been noted in broiler chickens exposed to experimental salt-induced ascites syndrome (Gupta, 2011 ). Therefore, one reason for the ineffective- ness of treatments in our study on EOF may be due to differences in methods of ascites induction.Thus, the use of cold temperature for stimulation of ascites has no significant effect on the fragility of RBCs membrane, unlike common salt induction.The lower RV:TV ratio observed as a result of the diets supplemented with feed additive may be attributed to the reduced SBP (as shown in T able 4), which, in turn, diminishes the additional burden on RV and subsequently reduces hypertrophy.The results of gene expression revealed that the broilers fed vitamin E exhibited lower ACE mRNA levels in their lung tissue compared to those fed L-arginine, though the exact cause remains unclear.
Addition- ally, the use of HES, HEM and captopril resulted in a reduction in ACE expression level in lung tissue of broilers compared to control and L- arginine groups. Studies have shown that the use of plant extracts can decrease ACE gene expression in aortic endothelial cells of rats (Bal- asuriya & Rupasinghe, 2011 ).This reduction in ACE gene expression may be related to the presence of flavonoids such as quercetin, rutin and others.During recent decades, the use of flavonoids as a strategy for reg- ulating hypertension has garnered attention and has been found to be effective as natural ACE inhibitors.Previous researches indicate that the supplementation of flavonoids can inhibit the ACE activity (Balasuriya & Rupasinghe, 2011 ; Wu et al., 2023 ).For example, sup- plementation with quercetin has been shown to lead to a significant decrease in plasma ACE level (Häckl et al., 2002 ).
Moreover, apigenin and luteolin have been found to inhibit the ACE activity in a dose-dependent manner (Balasuriya & Rupasinghe, 2011 ). In the present study, feeding flavonoids resulted in a reduction in ACE mRNA lev- els.Therefore, our results suggest that the reduction in ACE activity caused by plant secondary metabolites may be due to ACE gene downregulation.In addition to relaxation of pulmonary arteries and consequently a reducting the outbreak of ascites syndrome by decreasing Ang II lev- els, ACE inhibition can enhance antioxidant capacity as well.It has been reported that ACE inhibition leads to the limitation of vascular NAD(P)H oxidase stimulation, thus preventing increased superoxide flux with the renin-Ang system activation can be prevented (Münzel &K e a n e y , 2001 ).
Due to the reaction of superoxide with NO, the inhibition of ACE can enhance the NO bioactivity, and such a predic- tion has come true among the patients suffering from coronary artery and in a number of experimental models of hypertension (Münzel & Keaney, 2001 ). This inhibition can enhance NO bioactivity, as super- oxide can react with NO, leading to improved blood flow, particularly in pulmonary vessels, and a reduction in additional burden on the RV.Furthermore, since superoxide is a major source of H 2O2,A C E inhibitors can limit smooth muscle proliferation (Münzel & Keaney, 2001 ).Abd Alla et al.( 2013 ) have reported that ACE inhibition can have ROS-dependent and ROS-independent anti-atherogenic influ- ences.Therefore, ACE inhibitors play a pivotal role in reducing the incidence of ascites syndrome.
It has been reported that flavonoids can have both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on NO levels due to their complex interactions with NO synthesis and bioavailability of NO; accordingly, some flavonoids may scavenge NO due to their pro-oxidant properties by increased production of superoxide (O 2−). However, it has been shown that quercetin, a plant flavonol, is a better scavenger of O 2−compared to NO, particularly under conditions of increased O 2−.Moreover, under oxidative stress circumstances, NO may be also protected from superoxide-driven inactivation by flavonoids due to their ability to prevent the overexpression of ROS generating enzymes.Furthermore, flavonols, flavones and fava-3-ols and their glucuronidated metabo- lites have been found to be potent O 2−scavengers (Duarte et al., 2014 ).Lee et al.
( 2003 ) reported that production of NO in cytokine- stimulated astrocytes can be inhibited by the reduced availability of L-arginine, which leads to the suppression iNOS expression. Arginine, an essential amino acid, plays a crucial role in various physiological functions in broiler chickens.It is not only necessary for optimal growth but also vital for processes such as NO production, polyamine syn- thesis, protein biosynthesis, nitrogen transportation and excretion and stimulation of several endocrine glands (Efron & Barbul, 1998 ,2000 ).Additionally, it acts as a significant microbiocidal molecule (Cela et al., 2023 ; Qi et al., 2023 ).Furthermore, unlike the supplementation of HES and vitamin E, including captopril in the diet of broiler chickens led to an increase in the expression of iNOS mRNA.This finding aligns with Baroni et al.(2004 ), who observed an increase in the NO production and iNOS gene expression in the human keratinocyte cells treated with captopril.
SHIRZADI ET AL . 9o f1 1 5 CONCLUSION It can be concluded that supplementing diet with HES and HEM at levels of 200 mg/kg diet can mitigate prevalence of ascites syndrome outbreak in broiler chickens.Moreover, when there is a possibility of ascites syndrome outbreak in broiler chickens, L-arginine (40% above requirement), vitamin E (100 mg/kg diet) and captopril (15 mg/kg diet) can be added to the diet to deal with this disease.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Conceptualization; Investigation; Project administration; Resources; Writing—original draft: Hassan Shirzadi.Project administration; Supervision; Validation; Visualization; Writing—review and editing: Farid Shariatmadari.Methodology; Project administration; Super- vision; Validation; Visualization:Mohammad Amir Karimi-Torshizi.Data curation; Software: Ali Akbar Masoudi.Formal analysis; Vali- dation; Visualization; Writing—review and editing: Shaban Rahimi.Software; Validation; Visualization: Fakhredin Saba.
