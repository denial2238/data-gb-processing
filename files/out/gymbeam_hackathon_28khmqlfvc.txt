RNA conformations are generally strongly affected by positively charged metal ions (especially Mg2+). We have quantitatively explored the combined effect of ligand (2′′′′′-dG) and Mg2+binding on the energy landscape of the aptamer domain of the 2′′′′′-dG riboswitch with both ex- plicit solvent all-atom molecular dynamics simulations (99 μsec aggregate sampling for the study) and selective 2′′′′′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) experiments.We show that both ligand and Mg2+are required for the sta- bilization of the aptamer domain; however, the two factors act with different modalities.The addition of Mg2+remodels the energy landscape and reduces its frustration by the formation of additional contacts.In contrast, the binding of 2′′′′′-dG elim- inates the metastable states by nucleating a compact core for the aptamer domain.
Mg2+ions and ligand binding are re- quired to stabilize the least stable helix, P1 (which needs to unfold to activate the transcription platform), and theriboswitch core formed by the backbone of the P2 and P3 helices. Mg 2+and ligand also facilitate a more compact structure in the three-way junction region.Keywords: magnesium; RNA folding; mRNA structure; molecular dynamics; riboswitch INTRODUCTION Riboswitches are structured RNA elements located in the 5′-untranslated regions of bacterial mRNAs.They can reg- ulate the transcription or translation of downstream mRNAs in response to the specific binding of small molecules.To date, three purine-sensing riboswitches have been discov-ered, which sense adenine (Mandal and Breaker 2004), guanine (Mandal et al.2003), or 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (2′- dG) (Kim et al.2007).Their characterization has helped elu-cidate mechanisms of gene regulation by riboswitches.
The 2 ′-dG riboswitch is a close variant of the guanine-sens- ing riboswitches (Kim et al. 2007).Biochemical and phylo-genetic analyses of this family have indicated that the metabolite-binding aptamer domain adopts a distinct or- ganization of three helices (P1, P2, and P3) around thethree-way junction, which serves as the ligand-binding pocket (Fig.1; Mandal et al.2003; Mandal and Breaker 2004; Kim et al.2007).These purine-sensing riboswitchesalso share similar 3D structures.The P1 helix from the ribo- switch aptamer domain, whose two strands are distal in sequence, can either aid in the formation of the ligand-binding pocket or form an alternative helix with a down- stream sequence, forming the expression platform and switching the conformation of the riboswitch between theON and OFF states.The P2 and P3 helices both have stem –loop structures.Their loop regions, L2 and L3, inter- act with each other to form tertiary contacts constitutingthe pseudoknot (PK) interaction.
In terms of function, the purine-sensing riboswitches encompass a diverse mode of riboswitch-mediated gene regulation. The xpt-pbuX Bacillus subtilis riboswitch regulates gene expression by acting as a transcriptional OFF switch (Mandal et al.Corresponding author: kys@lanl.gov Handling editor: Eric WesthofArticle is online at http://www.rnajournal.org/cgi/doi/10.1261/rna .079767.123.Freely available online through the RNA Open Access option.© 2024 Ding et al.This article, published in RNA, is available under a Creative Commons License (Attribution 4.0 International), as de- scribed at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.ARTICLE 992 RNA (2024) 30:992 –1010; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society 2003), whereas the pbuE Bacillus subtilis riboswitch con- trols the downstream genes as a transcriptional ON switch (Mandal and Breaker 2004).On the other hand, the addVV Vibrio cholerae riboswitch is a translational ON switch (Wacker et al.2011).
The 2′-dG riboswitch transcriptionally regulates the gene encoding the ribonucleotide reductase subunit β(Kim et al. 2007; Wacker et al.2011), where the ligand, 2′-dG, is base- paired to residue C80 positioned at J31 (Pikovskaya et al.2011), as elucidated by the crystal structure.NMR studies suggest that the ON –OFF states are regulated by breaking the P1 helix and forming a new helix between part of the P1helix and the expression platform of the riboswitch in the absence of ligand binding during the transcription process (Helmling et al.2017, 2018).To fully understand the ribo-switch operation, it is crucial to understand how the struc- ture (Pikovskaya et al.2011) and the mode of regulation (Kim et al.2007) of the downstream genes depend on thesubtle structural modulation of the aptamer domain of the riboswitch, especially the P1 helix.
In terms of molecular simulation studies, explicit-solvent simulations have been applied to the SAM-sensing aptamer domain, revealing the glassy behavior of Mg 2+ surrounding the RNA molecule and the general mecha- nism of Mg2+mediation of RNA fluctuation (Hayes et al. 2012).Later, by the combination of SHAPE probing (selec- tive 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) ex- periments and GEM (generalized electrostatic model) simulations (Hayes et al.2015), the change in dynamics be- tween the conformational ensembles characterizing thefree state of the SAM-sensing aptamer domain and the SAM-bound complex have been mapped and revealed key insights into structural preorganization and Mg 2+re-quirements for ligand binding at nucleotide resolution (Roy et al.2019).
Here, we investigate, in detail, the effect of the Mg2+ion concentration on the ligand-free aptamer structure and the ligand-induced RNA folding pathway of the aptamer domain of the 2′-dG riboswitch from Mesoplasma forum (mfl-aptamer). To quantitatively cap- ture the nonlinear effects of ligand and Mg2+binding, the apo and holo structures of the mfl-aptamer (Fig.1) were in- vestigated by both detailed explicit-solvent simulationsand SHAPE probing experiments in the wetlab.Our com- putational and experimental studies have provided a struc- tural basis for the RNA aptamer response to the Mg 2+ concentration and ligand needed for the recognition of the 2′-dG, suggesting potential pathways of conformation changes.In particular, our study reveals that both ligand and Mg2+ are required for a well-funneled energy landscape for themfl-aptamer.We show how ligand binding stabilizes the P1 helix, the junction region, and the riboswitch core by in- ducing a more compact core.
We also show how Mg 2+ binding stabilizes these regions by bridging negatively charged RNA backbone regions. Mg2+helps to reduce the frustration of the system and remodel the energy land- scape by forming specific interactions.Importantly, thebinding of ligand directly eliminates the metastable states and remodels the energy landscape into a single basin.The study of the stability of the P1 helix also helps to shed lighton the conformational change mechanism between tran- scription OFF and ON states for the entire 2 ′-dG ribo- switch, of which the P1 helix destabilization plays a majorrole.To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the combined effects of ligand binding and Mg 2+on the mfl-aptamer at the atomistic level with a full physical model AB FIGURE 1.(A,B) The secondary structure and X-ray crystallographic structure of 2′-dG riboswitch used for explicit-solvent simulation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Ligand and Mg2+mediation of global and local fluctuations is captured by explicit-solventsimulations Global fluctuations Six conditions combining three different Mg2+concentra- tions and the absence and presence of ligand have beenstudied with explicit-solvent simulations.Eight parallel sim- ulations were performed for each condition.Every simula- tion performed was 2 µsec in duration.The simulationsshow that the overall fluctuations of the aptamer domain of 2 ′-dG riboswitch from M.
forum (mlf-aptamer) are influ- enced by the concentration of ions and are also dependenton the presence and absence of ligand binding. The aver- age root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and the radius of gyration show that the system has larger fluctuations com-pared with the crystal structure when there is no Mg 2+in thesystem or in the absence of a bound ligand.Conversely, in the presence of Mg2+and ligand, the system has lower fluc- tuations and is more stable (Fig.2).The RMSD curves suggest that (1) metastable states may exist in the absence of Mg2+and ligand, possibly related to more disordered structures of the mlf-aptamer, and (2) these disordered states are suppressed in the presence of either ligand or Mg2+(Fig.2B –D;Supplemental Fig.S4).Although the global fluctuations of the aptamer domain decrease substantially as the Mg2+concentration changes from 0 to 5 mM, the fluctuation level does notchange significantly as the Mg 2+concentration changes from 5 to 20 mM.
This may be related to the fact that the number of Mg2+ions condensed onto the RNA changes much more slowly compared to the overall Mg2+concen- tration. That is, the localization sites of Mg2+close to the RNA may be saturated.Interestingly, when both ligandand Mg 2+are absent in the system, although the mlf- aptamer is still well-organized, additional disordered states have emerged and are considerably populated (Fig.2A).To explicitly study the metastable states in more detail, we computed the free energy landscapes for the different cases.The principal component (PC) analysis is applied to A CDB FIGURE 2.Global RMSD for the first four of eight replicas with different conditions at 300 K.( A) Case without Mg2+(0 mM Mg2+) and without ligand (dG[−]).(B) Case without Mg2+(0 mM Mg2+) and with ligand (dG[+]).( C) Case with Mg2+(5 mM Mg2+) and without ligand (dG[ −]).(D) Case with Mg2+(5 mM Mg2+) and with ligand (dG[+]).
In general, the fluctuations of the system become lower with the addition of either the ligand or Mg2+. Metastable states with larger fluctuation exist without Mg2+or ligand but are not heavily populated.However, in the absence of both ligand and Mg2+, these partially disordered states emerge in the overall population.Ding et al.994 RNA (2024) Vol.30, No.8 study the fluctuations of the mlf-aptamer.The Cartesian co- ordinates of all the heavy atoms of the RNA molecule areused as the variable set.The covariance matrix was calculat- ed and then diagonalized to obtain the PCs.The free ener- gy in the PC1 –PC2 space (Fig.3; Supplemental Fig.S5 ) shows that the mlf-aptamer has a well-funneled energy landscape with a clear, single basin in the most stable case (both ligand and Mg 2+present).In the absence of li- gand, consistent with the RMSD results, the energy land- scape is rugged and this ruggedness increases as [Mg2+] decreases.
In the absence of Mg2+, the energy landscape is slightly rugged in the presence of ligand; however, when both ligand and Mg2+are absent, the energy land- scape is much flatter and rugged with nonnative structuresbecoming heavily populated. Consistent with the RMSD results, these results indicate that the frustration of the en-ergy landscape is reduced by ligand binding and divalent cation condensation.More specifically, although the bind-ing of Mg 2+helps confine the energy landscape, the com- plete elimination of metastable states requires the binding of the ligand.Local fluctuations: P2 and P3 helices To explore the contribution of distinct parts of the ribo-switch to the global fluctuations, we align the simulationtrajectories to the crystal structure and then analyze the key regions —helixes (P1, P2, and P3), loops (L2 and L3), and junctions (J12, J23, and J31) —by calculating the RMSD for each region.
The stability of P2 and P3 helices are similar in general, and the subtle difference in stability is sensitive to the method of measurement. Previous AB CD FIGURE 3.Ligand and Mg2+binding help shift the population to the native, ligand-bound state in the free energy landscape in principal component PC1–PC2 space at 300 K.( A)C a s ew i t h o u tM g2+(0 mM Mg2+) and without ligand (dG[ −]).(B)C a s ew i t h o u tM g2+(0 mM Mg2+) and with ligand (dG[+]).(C)C a s ew i t hM g2+(5 mM Mg2+) andwithout ligand (dG[ −]).(D)C a s ew i t hM g2+(5 mM Mg2+) and with ligand (dG[+]).When ligand and Mg2+are both absent, the energy landscape is rugged with the emergence of many metastable states.Upon the addition of Mg2+, the energy landscape becomes more confined, but the nonnative structures are still populated.However, the binding of the ligand eliminates the local minima and restrains the sys - tem in its native structure.
With the presence of both ligand and Mg2+, the system shows a well-funneled energy landscape at the global minimum.Landscape of mRNA elements www.rnajournal.org 995 studies on two types of adenine ribo- switches have shown, by computation(Lin et al. 2014) and single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments (Gre- enleaf et al.2008; Neupane et al.2011), that the P2 and P3 helices can change the order of their stabilities even with slight changes in the se-quence.Consistently, fluorescence methods have shown that the addad- enine riboswitch has a dynamic P2 he-lix that can be suppressed by ligand binding or Mg 2+addition, showing that its P2 helix is more sensitive tothe environment (St-Pierre et al.2021).However, the similar studies on the xptguanine riboswitch suggest a more stable P2 helix by single-mole- cule force spectroscopy (Chandra et al.2017) and yet a more dynamicP2 helix from the fluorescence study (Brenner et al.2010).
This demon- strates the ambiguities around theconcept of the overall “stability ”of an RNA element, as it may correspond to the measurement of different prop-erties in different contexts. The average regional RMSD (Fig.4A) shows that helix P2 has slightly larger average fluctuations than P3 when Mg 2+is present.On the other hand, when it comes to the stability of internal base pairs, although their dissociation probability is small, tra-jectories show that base pairs are more likely to break in the P3 helix than in the P2 helix ( Supplemental Fig.S6 ), especially those close to the L3 loop.The decreased stability of the P3 helix (compared with the P2 he-lix) is also suggested by the average fluctuations at the residue level (Fig.4B), which may occur because thereare a greater number of less stable A-U pairs in the P3 helix than P2.When Mg 2+is removed from the system, the RMSD of the P3 helix in- creases more than that of the P2 helix.
The P3 helix has likely been influencedby the weakened pocket region and the P1 helix. This effect becomes more obvious when the ligand is alsoremoved (see the section Local fluctu- ations: binding pocket and the P1 helix).A B FIGURE 4.Regional fluctuation analysis.( A) Average regional RMSD for different conditions at 300 K, eight replicas combined.At room temperature, helices have similar scale of fluctuationwith the presence of ligand.When the ligand is unbound, the fluctuation of the P1 helix and junctions increase the most, and the stability of P3 helix is also influenced with the further remov- al of Mg 2+.The PK (loops, red) is the most flexible motif with the presence of ligand, but its fluc- tuations are not sensitive to the change of conditions.( B) Structure of mlf-aptamer colored by heat map of root-mean-square-fluctuation (RMSF) of different conditions at 300 K with eightreplicas combined.
Consistent with the RMSD analysis, the fluctuation in the P1 helix and pocket region becomes larger with the removal of either ligand or Mg 2+, and the fluctuation of the PK is rather independent of the ligand and Mg2+condition.Ding et al. 996 RNA (2024) Vol.30, No.8 Local fluctuations: binding pocket and the P1 helix The binding pocket is composed of three junctions — namely, J12, J23, and J31.In this region, the 2′dG ligand forms a Watson –Crick base pair with C80 located in J31.Moreover, the regions of P1, P2, and P3 helices close to the junctional regions are also involved in the pocket envi-ronment because of their adjacency in sequence.We ob- serve that the fluctuations of the junctions become larger with the removal of ligand or Mg 2+(Fig.4), confirming that both ligand and Mg2+are involved in stabilizing the binding pocket.PC analysis shows that the pocket fluctu- ates in different modalities when either Mg2+or ligand is removed.
The fluctuations in the former condition are induced by the separation of the P2 and P3 helices (see the section Riboswitch core). In the latter case, the fluctua-tions are induced by the vibration of the J23 portion.Because the P1 helix is formed by two strands distal in se- quence and both are linked to the binding pocket, fluctua-tions of P1 are coupled with the binding pocket, which is also reflected in the RMSD (Fig.4).In the presence of Mg 2+, the perturbation of base pairs does not affect the overall structural integrity of the P1 he- lix, although PC analysis reveals that the motion of the P1 helix under this condition includes twisting, bending, andstretching (see details in Supplemental Movies S1 –S18).In the absence of Mg 2+, dissociation of P1 helix base pairs is rarely observed in the presence of ligand, but maycause altered stacking inside the helix, changing the con- formation of the P1 helix transiently (Fig.2B; Supplemental Fig.S6 ).
When both ligand and Mg 2+are absent, the disso- ciation of the P1 helix (Fig. 5B; Supplemental Fig.S6 ) be- comes much more frequent, showing a stronger alternate stacking effect, resulting in the two-state behavior (Fig.5A) discussed in the section Global fluctuations.In these cases where the P1 helix is distorted, the P3 helix can also show larger fluctuations (Fig.5A), whereas the P2 helix re-mains less affected in all eight replicas.This different behavior between the P2 and P3 helices might result from the fact that the P3 helix is separated from the P1 helixby two residues (whereas the P2 helix is separated by three), and shares the major groove with P1.However, among all the simulations we conducted, it appears thatthe alternate stacking only happens within the P1 helix, which induces fluctuations in the pocket region and the P3 helix as well.
Meanwhile, the base pair dissociation ofthe P3 helix can only amplify the fluctuations in the junction region with no alternate stacking ( Supplemental Fig. S8 ).This implies that the dynamics of the system is more sensi-tive to the P1 helix (the mechanism will be discussed in the section Mechanism of ion and ligand regulation), which may help elucidate the conformational change of the mlf- aptamer, which starts with the melting of the P1 helix, in the gene expression regulation process.This process serves as a general mechanism for gene expression regula-tion in the purine-sensing riboswitch family.Our results are consistent with previous single-molecule force spectro-scopy experiments on pubE andaddadenine riboswitches (Greenleaf et al.2008; Neupane et al.2011), xptguanine riboswitch (Chandra et al.2017), and simulations of theadd adenine riboswitches (Di Palma et al.2013).
These studies have shown that the P1 helix is the least stable helix of the aptamer domain of both, and that the stability of theP1 helix is ligand-dependent. Similarly, serial femtosecond crystallography also showed that the P1 helix in the apo state is notably less stable than the ligand-bound state intheaddadenine riboswitch (Stagno et al.2017).Local fluctuations: the pseudoknot The two loops —namely, L2 and L3 —form a kissing loop identified as an HHH-type PK (Peselis and Serganov 2014) on the top of the mlf-aptamer, and show a large but consistent fluctuation amplitude among different con-ditions at 300 K, except when both ligand and Mg 2+are ab- sent (Fig.4).This leads to two hypotheses: First, the PK is less stable than helices; second, unlike the guanine ribo-switch (Nguyen et al.2009), the fluctuation and formation of the PK of the mlf-aptamer might not be coupled with li- gand binding.
To better understand this phenomenon, two base pairs (G45 –C69 and G46 –C68) and an essential base stacking in- teraction (A42 –A71) from the PK were studied (Fig. 5C,D).This metric demonstrates that these native interactions (or native contacts) present in the crystal structure can detach at room temperature, which, in turn, causes regional distor-tion and deviation from the crystal structure of the PK re- gion.However, this distortion of the PK contributes very little to the overall conformational because the overallstructure is still preserved, even when some of the native contacts are dissociated.This stability is interesting because the PK has fewer base pairs and therefore lessbase stacking compared with the helices.The crystal struc- ture indicates that the novel lock-and-key loop motif (in- cluding A42 –A71 stacking) might be crucial to the PK formation because it contributes more than half of the loop –loop contact surface (Pikovskaya et al.2011).
Our sim- ulations also indicate that this structure might be at least asstable as the base pairs in the PK (G46 –C69 and G46 –C68), as the breaking of G45 –C69 has little effect on the overall formation of the PK. Moreover, even if the base stackingdissociates, the “key”(A71) can still stay in the “locked ” conformation by L2.This could be attributed to the fact that, due to the large contact surface, A71 can form diversecontacts (base stacking and hydrogen bonds) with L2 other than the native ones.Previous NMR results have indicated the presence of a reverse Hoogsteen base pair between U41 and A71 (Wacker et al.2011); however, this conformation was not detected in the crystal structure, where the two bases areLandscape of mRNA elements www.rnajournal.org 997 A B C D FIGURE 5.Regional fluctuation is related to RNA contacts.( A,B) Replica 2 and replica 8 with 0 mM Mg2+, dG[−], 300 K.
The metastable state where P1 and P3 helices are distorted and the joint major groove is open can result from the breaking of near-junction base-pairings on P1 helix. ( C,D)T w o examples —with the presence of Mg2+at 300 K (5 mM Mg2+, dG[−], and 20 mM Mg2+, dG[+], respectively).Although the number of contacts of PK is small, the dissociation of them only causes local distortion, which does not melt the PK and has little effect on global fluctuation.Distances be- tween base pairs are measured as the distance between the N1 atom of purine bases and the N3 atom of pyrimidine bases.The distance for base stacking is defined as the distance between the center of mass of the bases.Ding et al.998 RNA (2024) Vol.30, No.8 perpendicular to each other (Pikovskaya et al.2011).In sim- ulations, this conformation was found to have a lifetime of∼100 nsec under several conditions.This can explain how the PK could be effectively both “stable ”and “unstable ” simultaneously.
We conclude that the PK is indeed less sta-ble; on the other hand, the free energy landscape might be relatively flat for the PK, whereas the energy barrier of its dissociation is high, making the response to ligand bindingweak. Riboswitch core The flexibility of the PK enables the region closest to the PK, the riboswitch core formed by the P2 and P3 helices, to fluc- tuate and respond to ligand binding and changes in ionconcentration.The first few PCs with the presence of both ligand and Mg 2+show that the distance between P2 and P3 helices can be much larger than that observed inthe crystal structure (see Supplemental Movies S1 –S18 for the PCs and Supplemental Movie S19 for the trajectory).This expanding and contracting of the riboswitch core is measured by the distance between the P2 and P3 helices —more specifically, the distance between the phosphorus of G34 or G35 (both on the P2 helix) and U74 (on the P3 he- lix).The distribution of this distance (Fig.
6) also shows that the conformation of the contracted core is less populatedwith the removal of ligand or Mg 2+. The detailed mecha- nism will be discussed in “Mechanism of ion and ligand regulation.” Mechanism of ion and ligand regulation Ion concentration Because every nucleotide of RNA is negatively charged, cations, especially Mg2+, are strongly attracted to the RNA phosphate backbone and less mobile than free ions.Thus, the term “ion concentration ”is used in reference to “bulk concentration, ”which is the concentration of ions in the bulk solution, where ions are considered free.For in vitro experiments, this effect can hardly affect the ion concentration because there are many more ions thanRNA.However, because of the size of the simulation box, we have a similar number of free and bound cations in the simulation, and this effect needs to be taken into account.
Here, we considered the region at least 15 Å away from RNA as a bulk solution for the calculation of ion concentra- tions. A correction, which was induced by ion interactions,was then made to this raw concentration to obtain the actu- al concentration (Hayes et al.2012).The details are shown inSupplemental Information Section 3 .Next, the preferential interaction coefficient (see Supple- mental Information ), which is the ratio of excess ions com- pared with bulk concentration, representing the numberof ions attracted to the RNA backbone, was calculated.Consistent with previous molecular dynamics studies (Hayes et al.2012), it shows that the preferential interactioncoefficients of Mg 2+are not very sensitive to the concentra- tion of Mg2+as long as sufficient ions are present (see dis- cussion in the section Global fluctuations).This is one of thereasons for obtaining similar results for our simulations at 20 mM Mg 2+and 5 mM Mg2+.
It is also worth noticing that, consistent with previous studies (Hayes et al. 2012),all the Mg 2+in our simulations remain hydrated, whereas K+can dehydrate and contact with RNA directly as a result of the ion force field.Ion association site and residence time To investigate how Mg2+influences the fluctuations of RNA, we determined the Mg2+and K+association sites us- ing a method previously reported (Hayes et al.2012).The trajectory was first mapped onto the 3D structure of theA B FIGURE 6.The cumulative distribution of P2 –P3 distance of different conditions at 300 K measured by phosphorous distance between ( A) G34@P2 and U74@P3, and ( B) G35@P2 and U74@P3.The presence of ligand and Mg2+both increase the tendency for the riboswitch core to shrink.Landscape of mRNA elements www.rnajournal.org 999 RNA.
For a given time t0, the mean-square displacement of a certain ion was then calculated by averaging over all pairs of points (Saxton 1997) with time lags t=1 ,2 ,a n d3d t(125 psec in this study) within a 1 nsec interval counted from thegiven time. The mean-squared displacement was fitted to <x 2>=6 Dtto obtain the diffusion coefficient D.The asso- ciation site was determined by the average ion coordinatein the time interval where the diffusion coefficient dropped below 10 μm 2/sec and rose above 100 μm2/sec.The resi- dence time was then calculated using the same method de-scribed previously (Hayes et al.2012).The A-form helices in the mlf-aptamer contain narrow and deep major grooves.And because of the coaxial stack-ing effect of the P1 helix, J31 junction, and P3 helices, a long major groove is formed between the P1A (A for the 5 ′end of the helix, and B for the 3′end, the same for the fol- lowing) and the strand containing P1B, J31, and P3B.
Because the major groove is narrow and the backbone forming it is negatively charged, cations are required tocompensate for the charges. It is shown that there are mul- tiple Mg 2+association sites inside the major groove ( Sup- plemental Movie S19 ), with a residence time of ∼10 nsec; however, despite the fact that there is always K+present in the major groove, no K+association sites can be found there even in the cases where Mg2+is absent in the system (Fig.7B,F).This suggests that the monovalent K+ions are diffusive with much weaker interactions with the major groove, which explains why the helix structure of P1 canbe distorted when Mg 2+is absent ( Supplemental Movie S20).On the other hand, the residence time also reflects the stability of the nearby region.With the removal of theligand, the residence time of Mg 2+in the major groove slightly decreases (Fig.7D,F), showing that the P1 helix be- comes less stable under this circumstance.
It can further beconfirmed that ligand binding strengthens the P1 helix because the distortion of the P1 helix in the Mg2+-free state can be quickly corrected with the presence of ligand. This is probably a consequence that the interaction between theupper part of the P1 helix and the junctional regions be- comes stronger with a more stable ligand-binding pocket.The riboswitch core formed by the P2 and P3 helices is also formed by the backbone of two strands, and therefore also mediated by Mg 2+.Analysis shows that this region has some of the longest-dwelling Mg2+inside (Fig.7).In the presence of the 2′-dG ligand, the P2 and P3 helices are clutched together, which further ensures the closure of the pocket region.Moreover, Mg2+tends to gather around the P2 and P3 helices with ligand present, while staying in between the two helices when ligand is absent.This is because the distance between the P2 and P3 helices istoo small for a hydrated Mg 2+to fit in with a shrunk ribo- switch core.
The trajectory shows that the cavity of P2 and P3 helices has to open for a hydrated ion to pass through.However, in ligand and Mg 2+-free state, the pocket is un- stable and tends to open. Unlike the major groove of the P1 helix which is also constrained by base-pairing andsequential adjacency, P2 and P3 helices do not have any contacts other than the steric clash and ion bridge that pull them together; thus, the instability of this region is ex-pected to serve as a driving force for the conformation re- arrangement in the following transcription.The PK region is exposed to the solvent so there is less constraint for the movement of ions.Besides, the large dis- tance between the L2 and L3 makes it difficult for Mg 2+to form an ion bridge between them.Thus, there are fewerMg 2+association sites in the PK region and the residence time of these sites is shorter.This could be the reason for the large fluctuation of the PK region.TABLE 1.

1000 RNA (2024) Vol. 30, No.8 We also report here a long ion asso- ciation site in the major groove of theP2 helix near residues G34 and G35 (Supplemental Movie S19 ).For several simulations, the Mg 2+residence time of this site is longer than the simulation time; for the others, it has a residence time longer than 1000 nsec, and whenthe Mg 2+leaves the site, another Mg2+or K+will immediately fill this site, also with a long residence time.Fluctuations of the mlf-aptamer measured experimentally bySHAPE Selective SHAPE probing experiments (Merino et al.2005; Wilkinson et al.2006), coupled with capillary electro- phoresis, can be used to measure RNAfluctuation experimentally and to in- vestigate the interplay between ligand, Mg 2+ions, and temperature.SHAPE probing reports on backbone flexibility at nucleotide resolution (Gherghe et al.2008), which provides insight into thelocal and global structural dynamics of the RNA under study.
Stability of helices Our SHAPE probing experiments eva-luate the stability of the structural elements in the riboswitch, includingthe three helices (P1, P2, and P3) un- der diverse solution conditions. Here, the mlf-aptamer RNA is folded at 20°C in different combinations of 2 ′- dG and Mg2+.We find that, in the presence of both the 2′-dG ligand and Mg2+, the aptamer folds into the canonical structure consistent with X- ray crystallographic studies.That is,helices P1, P2, and P3 are well formed and highly stable (see Fig.9E).The three-way junction (J12, J23, andJ31) is also well formed and highly sta- ble (see Fig.9E).Previously, Wacker et al.(2011) have shown that the Mg 2+facilitates ligand binding by enhancing the preorganiza- tion of structural motifs in the free mlf- aptamer.Our findings are consistent with this observation.When comparing the case of the aptamer without Mg2+ A C ED FB FIGURE 7.

9D), we see that Mg2+improves the stability of the three-way junction. We have observed that in the absence of Mg2+and ligand (see Fig.9B), the mlf-aptamer is not as structured, lacking a stable P1 helix and with a much less stable three-way junc- tion (the three-way junction is a hallmark for the structure of purine riboswitches in ligand-bound states) (Mandal et al.2003; Mandal and Breaker 2004; Kim et al.2007).Adding 2 ′-dG without Mg2+does not show an appreciable effect in strengthening the 3′-side of helix P1 (i.e., P1B), and does not appreciably stabilize the three-way junction (al- though it does help stabilize J23 somewhat).It was previous- ly observed (Greenleaf et al.2008) that in the apo state, helixP1 of the pbuE adenine riboswitch is not stable, but persis- tently forms only after ligand binding.Our analyses of the mlf-aptamer by SHAPE confirm that the helix P1 is unstable in the apo state and is stabilized in the presence of 2 ′-dG and Mg2+.
The P1 helix of the purine-sensing riboswitch is con- sidered a key genetic regulatory element that controlsgene expression, depending on ligand binding (Mandal et al. 2003; Mandal and Breaker 2004; Kim et al.2007) The 2 ′-dG-dependent dynamic equilibrium of the P1 helix sup- ports the regulatory function of the P1 helix that modulates downstream gene expression.Structural investigations of different guanine- and adenine-sensing riboswitches byNMR spectroscopy confirm that the P2 and P3 helices are fully or partially formed in the apo state and become more structured only after ligand binding (Buck et al.2007, 2010; Noeske et al.2007).The SHAPE electropherogram of the 2 ′-dG-free and Mg2+-free conditions reveals partially formed structures of the P2 and P3 helices.Such nu- cleotide flexibility indicates that the P2 and P3 helices are more flexible under 2′-dG and Mg2+-depleted conditions.
In contrast, nucleotides in P2 and P3 helices show reduced SHAPE reactivity in the presence of 2′-dG and Mg2+.T h i s observation indicates that the P2 and P3 helices becomesignificantly more structured upon ligand binding. Stability of the loop –loop interaction The Mg2+and ligand-dependent formation of a PK (loop – loop interaction) between the L2 and L3 loops occurs in oth-er purine-sensing riboswitches.The formation of PKs in ad- enine and guanine-sensing riboswitches are observed in the crystal structure (Serganov et al.2004), in NMR experi-ments (Steinert et al.2017), and in chemical probing exper- iments (Mandal et al.2003).Earlier studies of the adenine- sensing aptamer domain show that the adenine-free stateis conformationally heterogeneous, but in the presence of Mg 2+, is preorganized for adenine binding by forming PK in- teractions (Mandal and Breaker 2004).For G-box ribo-switches, nucleotides in the L2 and L3 loops also exhibit base complementarity (Mandal et al.2003).
The crystal struc- ture of the mlf2 ′-dG aptamer in the 2′-dG bound state sug-geststhat 2′-dG binding enhancesthe loop –loop interaction (PK) through the G45 –C69 and G46 –C68 base pairs (Pikov- skaya et al. 2011).It is also observed that Mg2+enhances the formation of the loop –loop tertiary interaction, corroborat- ing the earlier investigation with NMR (Wacker et al.2011).Surprisingly, in our SHAPE experiments, the nucleotides at L2 and L3 loop regions are found to be moderately reactive to highly reactive in terms of their SHAPE reactivity, which in-dicates that PKs are either not formed or highly dynamic.Thus, the formation of PKs in the mlf-aptamer remains un- clear in SHAPE experiments.We note that the mlf2 ′-dG aptamer differs from the B.subtilis xpt 2′-dG aptamer in the length of the P2 and P3 helices and in the sequence com- position of the L2 and L3 loops (Kim et al.2007).
The lengthsof the P2 and P3 helices are 7 and 6 bp, respectively, in the xpt2 ′-dG aptamer, whereas this pattern is reversed (6 bp in the P2 helix and 7 bp in the P3 helix) in the mlf2′-dG aptamer. This change in helical length may impact the asso- ciation of the L2 and L3 loops through PK interactions.We also observe that the NMIA reactivity trend for terminalloops differs between the xptandmlfaptamers (Edwards and Batey 2009).L2 and L3 from mlf-aptamer are highly re- active to NMIA (Kim et al.2007), suggesting a weakened in-teraction between L2 and L3.We hypothesize that PKs are poorly organized in the mlf-aptamer, even in the presence of 2 ′-dG and Mg2+, to the extent that they are not visible on the timescale of the SHAPE experiments.
The architecture of the binding pocket of the mfl-aptamer Previous structural analysis of the binding pocket of the gua-nine and adenine riboswitch by NMR, fluorescence, and chemical probing revealed a partially organized binding pocket in which a set of nucleotides in J23 acts as a flexible“lid”to encapsulate the ligand following its initial docking with pyrimidine at J31 (Gilbert et al. 2006; Ottink et al.2007; Rieder et al.2007; Stoddard et al.2008).Like the gua-nine and adenine riboswitches, in our case, the 2 ′-dG ligand binds with the mfl-aptamer in the presence of Mg2+through the purine riboswitch molecular recognition mode (Kim et al.2007).ITC experiments show that 2 ′-dG binds the mlf- aptamer in the presence of Mg2+(Edwards and Batey 2009).Under similar conditions, SHAPE probing data showsthat 2 ′-dG, in association with Mg2+, stabilizes the junction regions and subsequently forms the binding pocket (Ed- wards and Batey 2009).
The previous crystal structure (PDBID 3SKI) indicates the sugar moiety of 2 ′-dG anchors with G53 and A54 (G49 and A50 in our experiments) (Pikovskaya et al. 2011).This suggests that G53 and A54 (G49 and A50 inour experiments) play a role in securing the ligand within the pocket, leading to decreased flexibility of G53 and A54 (G49 and A50 in our experiments) in the presence of the ligandand Mg 2+.Similar to the previous findings (Edwards and Batey 2009; Pikovskaya et al.2011), our SHAPE experi- ments show significant structural changes, induced by theDing et al.1002 RNA (2024) Vol.30, No.8 interaction with 2′-dG and Mg2+,o c c u rt o w a r dt h eb i n d i n g pocket of the mlf-aptamer.This observation indicates a change of the disordered binding pocket in the absence of 2′-dG to an organized binding pocket in the presence of 2′-dG and Mg2+.
The reduced flexibility of specific nucle- otides at the binding pocket in the presence of ligand and Mg2+suggests their engagement in securing the ligand within the pocket. Without 2′-dG, nucleotides G53 and A54 (G49 and A50 in our experiments) at J23 exhibit flexibil- ity, consistent with previous NMIA chemical probing data (Edwards and Batey 2009).Thexptaptamer makes the principal contact with the li- gand via C74 at J31 (Mandal et al.2003).Similarly, the mlf- aptamer anchors the ligand 2′-dG through the C80 (C76 in our experiments) nucleotide at J31 (Pikovskaya et al.2011).Therefore, it is expected that the interaction of the mlf-aptamer with 2′-dG will result in a reduced SHAPE reac- tivity of C80 (C76 in our experiments).In our SHAPE data, an attenuation of the mobility of C80 (C76 in our experiments) is observed which supports a formation of Watson –Crick base pairs between 2′-dG and C80 (C76 in our experiments).
Experimental evidence shows folding and ligand binding ability dependence on Mg2+ Global fold and loop –loop interaction Mg2+titrations in the absence and presence of the ligand demonstrate the pivotal role of Mg2+to fine-tune the stabil- ity of structural motifs. The free RNA shows a less stable structure (Figs.8 and 9).Capillary electrophoresis dataanalysis for the 2 ′-dG riboswitch shows a drastic change when the aptamer domain is allowed to fold in the pres- ence of 5 mM Mg2+.The overall structural folding in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+is also supported by the related crystal structure of the add adenine riboswitch (Serganov et al.2004).In this case, for the add adenine riboswitch, Mg2+helps drive the aptamer domain into a competent conformation for ligand binding.Thus, for the addadenine riboswitch, the presence of Mg2+is sufficient to establish the peripheral L2 –L3 interactions that are observed in the purine riboswitch family (Mandal et al.2003; Stoddard et al.2008).
Previous reports indicated that the L2 –L3 inter- action is important for ligand binding for the aptamer domain of the adenine (Lemay et al. 2006) and guanine riboswitches (Batey et al.2004; Ottink et al.2007).In con-trast, our studies indicate that the loop –loop interaction is not a ligand-dependent phenomenon for the mfl2 ′dG aptamer.Interestingly, extensive mutational analysis per-formed by Edwards and Batey (2009) suggests the possibil- ity of an alternate conformation between L2 and L3 other than that reported for the xptRNA.The crystal structure of the mfl-aptamer in ligand-bound form unambiguously indicated the existence of a novel “key-and-lock ”loop mo- tif, which is organized by the stacking of adenine from theL3 loop into the L2 loop (Pikovskaya et al.2011).The M.flo- rumclass I-A riboswitch (used in this study) differs from the B.subtilis xpt riboswitch in terms of the length, sequence composition of the P2 and P3 helices, and the terminal loops (Kim et al.2007).
We hypothesize that the adenine – adenine base stacking interaction in the mfl-aptamer in the ligand-bound state compensates for the requirement of a ligand-dependent terminal L2 –L3 interaction. P1 helix We first performed SHAPE experiments of the ligand-free mfl-aptamer RNA system.Although the P1A strand is pro- tected to some degree in all the conditions, the SHAPE re- activity of the P1B helix indicates that the P1 helix is unstructured in the absence of Mg2+(Figs.8 and 9).As for the stability of the P1A strand, we speculated that, with- out ligand, a transient alternative helix forms between nu- cleotide positions 22 –25 (UUAU) and 31 –34 (GUAG), with the possible involvement of C21.Interestingly, positions U22, U23, A33, and A34 are consistently SHAPE protected.The stability of the P1 helix depends on both ligand and Mg2+but is independent of L2 –L3 tertiary interaction.
In contrast, for the guanine riboswitch, the structural stabilityof terminal base pairs in the P1 region in the presence of Mg 2+ions is cooperatively influenced by the stabilization of the L2 –L3 interactions (Hanke and Gohlke 2017). NMR data revealed that, for the pbuE adenine riboswitch, the formation of the P1 helix occurs only with both Mg2+and adenine (Nozinovic et al.2014).Here, the loop –loop inter- action did not inhibit the formation of the P1 helix in the WT pbuE adenine riboswitch (Nozinovic et al.2014).A single- molecule force microscopy experiment has also suggestedthat in the apo state, the P1 helix of the pbuE adenine ribo- switch is not stable on its own, but gradually forms only after ligand binding (Greenleaf et al.2008).Our results corrobo-rate previous observations (Gilbert et al.2006; Greenleaf et al.2008; Kim et al.2017).
Our studies suggest that helix P1 of the mfl-aptamer is part of the regulatory switching se- quence, and that a ligand-dependent reversible switching mechanism can only be accomplished in the presence of Mg 2+. Previous NMR studies on the mfl-aptamer (Wacker et al.2011) reported dependence of P1 stability on Mg2+ and ligand when the P1 helix is truncated (similar to the se-quence our experiments studied) and are in good agree-ment with our findings.P2 and P3 helices The structure of the P2 and P3 helices remains at least par-tially protected in the absence of ligand or Mg 2+(Figs.8 and 9).This observation suggested that both helices can preform in free RNA.Upon the addition of either ligandor Mg 2+, both helices become more protected against the reagent (Figs.8 and 9).The P3 helix shows slightly higher SHAPE reactivity but the nuance in the stability ofLandscape of mRNA elements www.rnajournal.org 1003 A B C D E F FIGURE 8.Unsmooth SHAPE probing data for the Mg2+and 2′-dG titrations.

At higher temperatures, the fluctuations of the RNA molecule and its structural motifs are magnified, allow- ing us to further explore the energy landscape. Therefore, ahigher temperature of 400 K was applied to these systems w i t h0a n d5m MM g 2+, and without ligand.Here, the RNA is more disordered compared with the room temperaturecounterparts.In both cases, the RNA has substantially melt- ed, giving a much larger RMSD compared with room tem- perature simulations (Fig.10).The conditions with a bound A B DEC FIGURE 9.Overlay of SHAPE reactivities onto a secondary structure model portraying a 76 nt mlf-2-dG aptamer RNA.The color code serves to distinguish reactive (and thus unconstrained) nucleotides in B–E.An absence of markings denotes unanalyzable nucleotides.The lightest gray de- notes nucleotides with the highest SHAPE reactivity, while the darkest gray indicates the lowest reactivity.( A) Secondary structure of 2′dG sensing riboswitch from M.florum in the ligand-bound state.
P1 helix is considered a regulatory helix. Crystal structure indicates G41 and G42 are forming a long-range tertiary interaction (or PK) with C64 and C65.C76 is the binding site for 2′dG.( B) 0 mM Mg2+without 2′-dG; ( C) 0 mM Mg2+with 20 µM 2′-dG; ( D) 5 mM without 2′-dG; and ( E) 5 mM with 20 µM 2′-dG.Landscape of mRNA elements www.rnajournal.org 1005 ligand are not included because dissociation and binding of ligand are difficult to sample at higher temperature.Even though the secondary and tertiary elements are un- stable at 400 K, the RNA molecule is still compact, as there are still many hydrogen bonds formed within the helices and the PK, whose number can even exceed the numberof native hydrogen bonds (Fig.10).For the P2 and P3 heli- ces, the noncanonical hydrogen bonds are formed be- tween the two helical strands, preventing the helices fromfully dissociating.
For the P1 helix and the PK, on the con- trary, the structural motifs separated in sequence (e.g., P1A and P1B for the P1 helix, L2 and L3 for the PK). The dis-tal regions dissociate and hydrogen bonds are formed in- side of the single motifs.On the one hand, the higher temperature study demonstrates how the RNA system canlower its free energy by forming substitute hydrogen bonds at high temperature, making a compromise between the in- ternal energy and entropic contributions to the free energy.The high-temperature study also demonstrates that the P2 and P3 helix have a higher stability, even though the P1 and P3 helices can show similar timescales of melting possiblyattributed to the coaxial stacking effect.Conclusions The aptamer domain of the 2′-dG mlfriboswitch ( mfl- aptamer) is responsible for the ligand-binding process nec-essary for modulating transcription regulation.
We have quantitatively studied, from the perspectives of both com- putation and experiment, the interplay between Mg2+, li- gand binding, and thermal stability on the structural scaffold, including the helices, junctions, and the PK, which is involved in this transition. Detailed analysis of these pro-cesses suggests the requirement of both ligand and Mg 2+ for the stabilization of the mfl-aptamer (necessary for the OFF state).Our studies provide a general mechanism forconformational changes of the P1 helix and consequent lo- cal melting.This melting, undoubtedly affected by the cou- pling effect of ligand and Mg 2+binding, is needed to regulate the formation of the expression platform and therefore transcription in the purine riboswitch family.Simulations at room temperature show that the likeli- hood of breaking hydrogen bonds is larger for the P1 helix compared with the P2 and P3 helices, especially in the ab- sence of Mg2+or ligand.
Simulations at 400 K, performed to amplify these differences in short simulations, also sug- gest a more compact structure for the P2 and P3 helices. This is in qualitative agreement with the SHAPE experi-ments.These experiments also suggest that P1 is the least stable helix at all conditions, particularly with the removal of either Mg 2+or ligand (Fig.9).Both experimental and simu- lation methods suggest that the three-way junction (the pocket of ligand binding) is disordered in the absence of li- gand in both Mg2+concentrations along with the P1 helixA B FIGURE 10.Regional stability at 400 K for ( A) 0 mM Mg2+, dG[−] and ( B) 5 mM Mg2+, dG[−].From lefttoright , the number of native hydrogen bonds formed in the region, the total number of hydrogen bonds formed in the region (both scaled by the number of native hydrogen bonds), and regional RMSD with the entire structure fit first (same as before).
The native helices and PK melt in both cases giving a large deviation from the native structure of ∼15 Å; however, the variety of hydrogen bonds donor and acceptor in nucleic acid makes it possible for the RNA motifs to form nonnative hydrogen bonds as compensation and lower the energy. As shown in the first column, the number of hydrogen bond caneven exceed the original number, and these newly formed hydrogen bonds can either be between the submotifs and collapse the structure, or inside the strand which makes the single strand curly.Ding et al.1006 RNA (2024) Vol.30, No.8 (Figs.4 and 9), suggesting a possible dynamical coupling between these two regions.Simulations also show that the stabilities for P2 and P3 helices are similar (Fig.4; Supplemental Fig.S6 ) and the ki- netic runs at higher temperature have shown that Mg2+ strengthens these helices (Fig.10).Both findings are sup- ported qualitatively by the SHAPE reactivity profiles.
However, further studies are needed to establish morecommensurate measures to help determine the underlying minor discrepancies between simulations and experiments and the conformational ensemble of the aptamer domainin the ligand-free state. The explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations (Figs.4 and 5C,D), SHAPE experiments (Fig.9), and previ-ous in-line probing experiments (Kim et al.2007) show that the mobility of the PK region is weakly sensitive to ligand binding.The simulations suggest an explanation for thisphenomenon.The energy landscape of the PK is relatively flat compared with the energy barrier between L2 and L3 because of the large contacting surface area that allowsnonnative hydrogen bond formation.On the other hand, this flat energy landscape allows the PK to break and reor- ganize its contacts, making the PK simultaneously less sen-sitive to environmental changes while being sensitive to thermal fluctuations.
In the absence of ligand, the elongation of the mRNA and the formation of the expression platform are a conse- quence of the breaking of the P1 helix accompanied by the formation of a new helix (antiterminator) that combines part of the P1 helix and part of the expression platform. This is the mechanism for switching the riboswitch to the ONstate (Helmling et al.2018).We postulate that this confor- mation change is facilitated by the flexible PK.Ligand bind- ing also results in key configurational entropy changes inthe flexible junction region and dynamic separation be- tween P2 and P3, which may help to facilitate the dynamics of P1.The ligand plays an essential role in this process because the absence of the 2 ′-dG molecule releases the restraints on the P1 helix, the pocket region, and the riboswitch core, cre-ating extra local minima in the energy landscape, which leads to a potential pathway for breaking up the P1 helix.
Although the mfl-aptamer is preorganized without Mg 2+, a decrease in Mg2+concentration also helps facili- tate the process of conformation change of the aptamer domain. Removing Mg2+from certain binding sites ampli- fies the frustration of the system, especially between nega- tively charged backbone strands, thus reducing the free energy barrier to escape from the native basin.The essen-tial dynamics of P1 helix fluctuations and riboswitch core breathing are both Mg 2+-dependent, both involving the separation of two strands.It should be mentioned thatthese two types of fluctuations are also strongly influenced by ligand binding, unraveling a cooperative stabilization ef- fect of ligand and Mg 2+.MATERIALS AND METHODS We have used both simulation and experimental methods to study the aptamer domain of 2′-dG riboswitch from M.forum (mlf-aptamer).The detailed procedures are described below.
Explicit-solvent all-atom simulation The simulation protocols and parameters follow our previous studies (Hayes et al. 2012) and are described in detail below.The simulations use the GROMACS package (Abraham et al.2015), v2019 and v2021.We have shown that both versionsproduce similar results ( Supplemental Fig.S2 ).The AMBER 99 forcefield (Wang et al.2000) was used with modified K +van der Waals parameters (Dang 1995) and SPC/E water, as in ourprevious study (Hayes et al.2012).The system with and without ligand was placed in a 100 Å box of water with 100 mM KCl, and MgCl 2concentrations of 0, 5, and 20 mM, providing six conditions in total.The RNA backbone is neg-atively charged, attracting extra K +and Mg2+and making these ions less mobile.Thus, the ion concentrations are computedfrom the concentration of free ions (bulk concentration).
The num-bers of ions required to produce the desired bulk concentrationswere determined iteratively repeating the equilibration processwith different numbers of ions to achieve the desired values ofbulk concentrations. Details are further discussed in the sectionIon concentration.Equilibration For each condition, equilibration started with the crystal structureof ligand-bound mfl-aptamer (PDB code: 3SKI) (Pikovskaya et al.2011).For ligand-absent simulations, the ligand was removed.First, the RNA molecule (and ligand, if present) was frozen withno solvent added; ions were placed throughout the box randomlywith their van der Waals radius and energy parameters modified tomimic the metal aquo complex; and different parameter sets forthe metal aquo complex were tested and produced similar results(Supplemental Fig.S3 ).
The system was then equilibrated at cons- tant volume at 300 K for 8 nsec, with stochastic dynamics and a di-electric constant of 80 to mimic water, producing a distribution ofions electrostatically equilibrated throughout the box. Next, thesystem was solvated with explicit water, and water moleculeswere equilibrated at constant volume at 300 K for 200 psec withall other species frozen.Ions were then set free and equilibratedin the same condition for another 4 nsec.RNA (and ligand, ifpresent) was then gradually released with position restraints of1000, 100, 10, 1, and 0 kcal/mol/nm 2.Each equilibration lasts for 2 nsec at 300 K and constant pressure.For production simula-tions, the entire system was free of restraints.Room-temperature simulations For each condition, eight parallel free explicit-solvent simulationswere performed without any restraints at constant volume at 300 Kfor each condition, starting with the equilibrated system.
All thesimulations were performed for 2 µsec, providing an aggregatesampling of 16 µsec in total for each condition, amounting to a to-tal of 96 µsec total room temperature production sampling.Landscape of mRNA elements www.rnajournal.org 1007 High-temperature simulations For conditions of 0 and 5 mM Mg2+, without ligand, a higher tem- perature of 400 K was also simulated. These simulations at hightemperatures magnify the fluctuations of the system, providing areference for the stability of different regions of the system(Sarkar et al.2021).High-temperature simulations started withthe equilibrated system at 300 K, which was heated to 400 K dur-ing 25 nsec at constant volume.The final states were then used torun two parallel simulations of 1.5 µsec.In vitro transcription of the mlf-aptamer The sequence corresponding to mlf-aptamer is placed in the cen- ter of an RNA structure cassette to facilitate analysis of 2′-O-adduct formation by the chemical probing reaction.
Surrounding se-quence stretches are required for any set of SHAPE experimentsfor the primer extension by reverse transcription. In particular,the SHAPE method requires an additional sequence beyond theaptamer to allow binding of the polymerase, necessary for readoutof the SHAPE reactivity.Usually, it is challenging to quantify the10–20 nt near the primer binding site.This difficulty arises because cDNA fragments, reflecting pauses by the reverse tran-scriptase enzyme during the primer extension ’s initiation phase, are present.Additionally, the 8 –10 positions at the 5 ′end of the RNA remain inconclusive because of the intense signal corre-sponding to the full-length extension product.To clearly observeSHAPE reactivities at the 5 ′and 3′ends of a specific RNA se- quence, we have placed the RNA sequence of interest within op-timized 5 ′and 3′structure cassettes.This design enables clearer evaluation of all positions within the RNA sequence of interest us-ing capillary electrophoresis.
Each helix in the cassette contains a stable UUCG tetraloop to enforce the designed fold (of the cassette) and eliminate interfer-ence with the RNA sequence of interest. The sequence of the DNAconstruct for current studies is given below: GAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATA GGGCCTTCGGGCCAAAG AA ACTTATACAGGGTAGCATAATGGGCTACTGACCCCGCCTT CAAACCTATTTGGAGACTATAAGTGAAAA CCGATCCGCTTCG GCGGATCCAAATTGGGCTTCGGTTCGGTTCGATAA ,w h e r er e d is the T7 promoter, magenta is the 5′structure cassette, black is themlf-aptamer sequence, and blue is the 3′structure cassette.A linear DNA template containing the mlf-aptamer sequence with the RNA structure cassette was procured as a gBlock (IDT).The gBlock is subjected to amplification using OneTaq DNAPolymerase (Takara), and the resulting DNA template is tran- scribed in vitro using a HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB) with the manufacturer ’s protocol.The transcribed RNA is purified by the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (NEB).
The purity ofmlf-aptamer RNA is assessed by an 8% Urea PAGE. The concentra- tion of mlf-aptamer RNA is determined using extinction coefficient 1405.4 mM −1cm−1(calculated using the server https://www .fechem.uzh.ch/MT/links/ext.html).Chemical probing 1M7 (SHAPE reagent) is synthesized as described previously(Mortimer and Weeks 2007).Thirty picomoles of mlf-aptamer RNA is thermally denatured at 95°C for 5 min, followed by imme-diately cooling on ice for 2 min.10× buffer (500 mM Na-HEPES,pH8.0, 1 M KCl, either with 5 mM MgCl 2or without MgCl 2) is add- ed to the RNA (final concentration of buffer is adjusted to 1× in100 μL reaction mixture) in the absence and presence of 20 μM of 2 ′-dG (Sigma).The RNA (±2′-dG) is incubated at 20°C to equilibrate.A solution of 1M7 in anhydrous DMSO or neatDMSO (for blank only) is then added to the tubes (final concentra-tion of 1M7 is adjusted to 3 mM) followed by incubation at 20°Cfor 10 min.
Immediately after modification, the modified RNA isprecipitated by the addition of 3 volumes of 100% cold ethanol,1/10th volume 3 M sodium acetate, and 25 μg glycogen (Thermo Fisher), followed by centrifugation. Primer extension The RNA pellet is resuspended in 7.75 μL of nuclease-free water.One microliter of 1.5 μM (1.5 pmol, total) of 5′-Alexa-488 labeled UniRev primer is mixed with the RNA, followed by incubationat 65°C for 1 min, 45°C for 5 min, and finally placed on ice for1 min.Primer extension mix is supplemented by 500 μMo fe a c h of the dNTPs, 10 mM DTT, 1× SSIII FS buffer, and 200 U/ μLo f SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen).A 15 μL primer extension reaction is initiated by incubating the mixture at 55°Cfor 1.25 h.A-sequencing reactions are identically performed onunmodified RNA.Only for sequencing reactions, the primer ex-tension mix is supplemented with 333 μM ddTTP.
Primer exten- sion reactions are desalted by spinning in the P-6 micro-biospincolumn (Bio-Rad). Data collection and processing Each sample is then diluted in deionized formamide in a 1:20 ratio(by volume) and heated to 95°C for 3 –4 min.The samples are elec- trokinetically injected (30 sec at 6 kV) onto an ABI Prism 3100-Avant quad-capillary instrument.A fluorescence electrophero-gram is then collected at 14 kV.Each electrogram is processedas per the protocol reported earlier (Hennelly et al.2013).Briefly, each data set is aligned and integrated using in-house soft-ware for the simultaneous fitting of multiple Gaussian peaks to thetraces.Area under the peak corresponding to each nucleotide isassigned by dideoxy-sequencing data.The integrated area for in- dividual nucleotides corresponding to the blank sample (RNA treated with neat DMSO) is then subtracted from SHAPE data(1M7 treated).
To normalize the areas, the first 10% of the data cor-responding to the highest reactivity values are considered outliersand are excluded. From the remaining data (areas), 10% of highlyreactive nucleotides are averaged to calculate a normalization fac-tor.The entire profile, including the previously excluded outliers,is then normalized by that factor.SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL Supplemental material is available for this article.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We acknowledge generous support from the National Institutesof Health (NIH) (RO1-GM110310 to J.N.O., RO1-GM110310 toK.Y.S.).Generous allocations of computational resources provid-ed by the Chicoma supercomputer by Los Alamos NationalLaboratory Institutional Computing are gratefully acknowledged.Ding et al.1008 RNA (2024) Vol.30, No.

Nat Protoc 1: 1610 –1616.doi:10.1038/nprot.2006.249 MEET THE FIRST AUTHOR Erdong Ding Meet the First Author(s) is an editorial feature within RNA,i n which the first author(s) of research-based papers in each issuehave the opportunity to introduce themselves and their work toreaders of RNA and the RNA research community.Erdong Ding is the first author of this paper, “Magnesium ions mitigate meta- stable states in the regulatory landscape of mRNA elements.” Erdong is currently a PhD candidate in Professor José Onuchic ’s group at the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics at RiceUniversity.He is working on both explicit-solvent and coarse- grained molecular dynamics simulation for riboswitch systems.What are the major results described in your paper and how do they impact this branch of the field?
We examined the 2 ′-dG riboswitch, a less-studied member of the purine-sensing riboswitch family, with both experiments and simu- lation tools. We have verified the well-known stability order of thehelices in this riboswitch family that the regulatory helix would bethe least stable but also worked out the mechanism of how ligand binding and Mg 2+affect the stability of the helices at the molecular level.This would in general help the community to better under- stand the conformation change of different riboswitch regulatoryhelices.What led you to study RNA or this aspect of RNA science?It is always fascinating to see how powerful hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces can be and how they have curved large bio-molecules like protein and RNA.
While the protein folding problem has been well-tackled with the energy landscape theory, RNA fold- ing is much more complicated, as the molecules are much moredynamic, and their energy landscape may deviate a lot from aperfect funnel or even be rugged. This makes RNA structures funto study from the perspective of both thermodynamics and kinetics.What are some of the landmark moments that provoked your interest in science or your development as a scientist?Back in middle school when I was first exposed to chemistry cours- es, I got confused by how qualitative everything seemed to be inthe field, and I believed there was much to learn and to do with regard to it.This has encouraged me on a path of physical chem- istry and computational chemistry in college and in grad school.If you were able to give one piece of advice to your younger self, what would that be?In science: Read more papers and ask more questions.In general: Be decisive, you have thrown away too many shots.Ding et al.
