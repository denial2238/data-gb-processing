In this context, we hypothesize d that serum vitamin K levels are associated with MSD in preschool children, and the widely used vitamin A and vitamin D supplements may mediate these ass ociations based on potential mechanisms, which expects to provide guidance for fut ure practice. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Sichuan province in southwestern China, from January /two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/one.tnum to May /two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum.Serum levels of vitamin K/one.tnum/K/two.tnum and /two.tnum/five.tnum(OH)D were determined using the high-performance l iquid chromatography method, and the diagnosis of MSD was executed by cli nicians.Overall and stratiﬁed logistic regression analysis based on categorized /two.tnum/five.tnum(OH)D levels were conducted to assess association between serum vitamin K levels and MSD prevalence after adjusting for confounders.
Mediation analy sis was further performed and vitamin A and D supplementation was regressed as t he mediator. Results: A total of /six.tnum,/three.tnum/six.tnum/eight.tnum children aged /zero.tnum–/six.tnum years old were enrolled.MSD was identiﬁed in /one.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum (/one.tnum/eight.tnum./five.tnum/one.tnum%) of the children, while /five.tnum,/one.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum (/eight.tnum/one.tnum./four.tnum/nine.tnum %) of them did not present such disorder.After adjusting confounders, a signiﬁ cant diﬀerence was found in serum vitamin K/one.tnum level between children in MSD and Non-MSD group (OR=/zero.tnum./eight.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum, /nine.tnum/five.tnum% CI/zero.tnum./seven.tnum/four.tnum/five.tnum–/zero.tnum./eight.tnum/six.tnum/four.tnum).
No signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found in serum vitamin K/two.tnum level between the two groups ( OR=/zero.tnum./nine.tnum/seven.tnum/five.tnum, /nine.tnum/five.tnum% CI/zero.tnum./seven.tnum/five.tnum/three.tnum–/one.tnum./two.tnum/six.tnum/one.tnum). The association between vitamin K/one.tnum level and MSD prevalence was partly (/three.tnum /six.tnum./eight.tnum%) mediated by vitamin A and D supplementation.Conclusions: A low serum vitamin K/one.tnum level is connected with an increased risk of MSD among children, highlighting that vitamin A and D supplem entation is a helpful intervention to prevent MSD in children with vitamin K de ﬁciency.KEYWORDS preschool children, serum vitamin K levels, musculoskeletal d isorders, a cross-sectional study, vitamin A and vitamin D supplement Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.org Ge et al.
/one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/five.tnum/four.tnum Background Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are conditions that can aﬀect the muscles, bones, and joints, which are also the largest source of global rehabilitation need, ranking ﬁfth in disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) and ﬁrst in years lived with disability (YLDs) ( 1,2). Childhood, an active stage of bone mineral accumulation and critical for adult peak bone mass ( 3,4), is a particularly susceptible window for prevention and treatment of MSDs (5).MSDs in childhood, such as rickets, can lead to bone deformities and diﬃculties with activities, which impact health substantially,growthanddevelopmentofchildrenandadolescents (6,7).
Poor treatment of musculoskeletal problems can have a negative inﬂuence on the quality of life and lead to short-term consequenceslikefractures,orlong-termoneslikeosteoporosis( 8– 12). This implies that MSDs in children should be given special attention due to their higher potential for skeleton healing and remodeling( 5).Age is not the sole factor inﬂuencing MSDs, as MSDs have been widely reported to be closely associated with nutrient intake: studies have shown that vitamin C can foster trabecular bone formation by modulating bone matrix gene expression ( 13, 14), while vitamin D and its metabolites contribute to bone development by aﬀecting intestinal calcium transport and serum calciumandphosphatehomeostasis( 15,16).Furthermore,vitamin A appears to aﬀect bone health by simulating osteoblastic activity and bone formation, as well as inhibiting osteoclastic activity and bone resorption ( 17).It also correlates with the availability of vitamin D receptor binding vitamin D ( 18).
Recent studies also suggest that vitamin K deﬁciency may serve as a predictor of MSDs by reducing the carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins,suchasosteocalcinandmatrixGlaprotein,whichregulate the calciﬁcation ( 19–22), thereby paving the way for etiological investigationsandinterventions. Some studies to date have examined the relationship between vitamin K and adult bone health, yielding some negative correlations between serum vitamin K levels and MSDs ( 23, 24).However, the study on vitamin K levels and its association with MSDs in children remains limited, particularly in preschool children who are experiencing active bone mineral accumulation.Vitamin K deﬁciency is one of the most common malnutrition issuesinChinesechildren( 25).Therefore,itisurgenttoexplorethe association between serum vitamin K levels in preschool children and their MSDs.
In addition, due to the potential side eﬀects of vitamin K ( 26), there is insuﬃcient evidence to recommend vitaminKsupplementationforchildren.However,somealternative interventions can be taken to reduce the adverse eﬀects of vitamin K deﬁciency. For instance, vitamin A (Vit A) and vitamin D (Vit D) are easily accessible, safe, and widely prescribed in China (27–29), acting synergistically in bone metabolism with vitamin K.Extrapolating from general population studies ( 30,31), it is plausible that Vit A and Vit D supplementation in MSD patients could serve as a potential therapeutic target to enhance bonehealth.This study aimed to assess 1) the association of two major subtypes of vitamin K [phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and menaquinone(vitaminK2)]inalargeChinesesampleofpreschool children with MSD and 2) the mediation eﬀect of Vitamin A/Dsupplement in the association between Vitamin K1/K2 levels and MSDsinpreschoolchildren.
Methods Participants and data collection sample sources Thestudyenrolledchildrenaged0–6yearsoldwhounderwent health assessments at outpatient clinics of the child health departments across 10 urban areas ( 32) comprising 18 maternal and child health hospitals in Sichuan Province ( Figure1) from January 2021 to May 2022. Variables considered in this study, including the participant’s age, gender, parents’ highest education, birth height, birth weight, gestational week and vitamin A and D supplementation reported by the participant’s guardians at enrollmentwereextractedfrommedicalrecords.Writteninformed consent was secured from their guardians before the study.Ethical approval for the study protocol was granted by the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital(2019,No.20).Musculoskeletal disorders Inthisstudy,childrendiagnosedwithdiseasessuchasO-leg,X- leg,pectuscarinatum,squareskull,andbonepainwereclassiﬁedas having an MSD.
The diagnosis of these conditions was conﬁrmed by clinicians according to the guidelines of Practical Child Health Care(33). Serum vitamin K/one.tnum/K/two.tnum and /two.tnum/five.tnum(OH)D concentrations The vitamin K and vitamin D levels in serum were assessed by high-performanceliquidchromatography(HPLC)( 34–36).Brieﬂy, 2ml of venous blood was collected in a standard biochemical tube (red cap tube) and stored at room temperature while being protected from light.Within 8h of collection, the samples were tested.Following the internal labeling vitamin K with liquid-liquid extractionandisotopeinternalstandardquantiﬁcation,theinternal standard working solution was transferred to a clear tube and subjected to centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10min.The resulting supernatant was collected and blown dry before being mixed with methanol for 1min.Lastly, vitamin K1, K2, as well as 25(OH)D in supernatantwerequantiﬁedbyHPLC(modelL550).
Covariates Some relative covariates were considered in the analysis. Information about socio-demographic factors and birth information was obtained through the Pediatric Health Care System, which mainly contained: age (year), gender (male or female), residential area (ten urban areas in Sichuan province), birth height (meter), birth weight (kilogram), Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org Ge et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/five.tnum/four.tnum FIGURE /one.tnum Distribution of /one.tnum/eight.tnum maternal and child health care institution in Sichuan province.gestational week, and parent’s degree (under junior high school, senior high school or technical secondary school and college andabove).
Statistical analyses Categorical variables were reported in terms of numbers and percentages, while continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviations (SD). To compare the characteristics of MSD and NMSD groups, Pearson chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-test were employed for continuous variables.Missing values were identiﬁed and imputed by multivariate imputationusingchainedequations( 37).We constructed logistic regression models to examine the associations between levels of vitamin K1/K2 as well as 25(OH)D and MSDs, with the former treated as continuous variables.To further investigate the associations between vitamin K1/K2 level and MSDs conditional on 25(OH)D level, we conducted stratiﬁed analysis based on categorized 25(OH)D levels, with 25(OH)D level <12ng/mL, ≤12-<20ng/mL, and ≥20ng/mL, representingnormal,insuﬃcient,anddeﬁcientlevelsofvitaminD, respectively ( 38).
All models were adjusted for children’s gender, residential area, birth height, birth weight, gestational week, and parents’ highest education. Additionally, to assess the inﬂuence of serum vitamin K1/K2 concentrations on MSD via vitamin A and D supplementation, vitamin A and D supplementation were regressed on the mediator variables.In this pathway,direct, indirect, total eﬀects and the proportion of mediation wereestimated.Furthermore, we conducted two sensitivity analyses to assess therobustnessofourresults.Theﬁrstanalysisexcludedthemissing data instead of using multivariate imputation, whereas the second analysis only included individuals with birth weight (2.5-4.0kg) andgestationalweek(37-42weeks)withinthenormalrange.AllanalysiswereperformedusingR,version4.0.3(RProjectfor StatisticalComputing).Forallstatisticaltests,asigniﬁcancelevelof two-tailed P≤0.05wasemployed.Estimatedeﬀectswerepresented withoddsratios( OR)and95%conﬁdenceintervals(95% CI).

Our study revealed no signiﬁcant gestational week disparities emerged between the groups (P=0.06). However, compared with the MSD group, the NMSD group were more likely to receive vitamin A and D supplementation(50.99vs.31.30%, P<0.001).Serum vitamin K/one.tnum/K/two.tnum concentrations for children Logistic regression models were applied to investigate the relationship between serum vitamin K1/K2 concentrations and the status of MSD in children.The models were adjusted for confounders, including residential area, kid’s gender, birth height, birth weight, gestational week and parents’ highest education.Our results revealed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in serum vitamin K1 levels between children in MSD and NMSD groups ( OR=0.802, 95%CI 0.745–0.864), however, there was no diﬀerence in serum vitamin K2 levels between the two groups ( OR=0.975, 95%CI 0.753– 1.261).To further examine whether 25(OH)D levels modiﬁed the associations, we constructed stratiﬁed logistic regression models.
The results indicated that there was no diﬀerence in the vitamin K1/K2 level among MSD and NMSD children in the vitamin D deﬁciency group ( <12ng/mL). Moreover, when the concentrationof 25(OH)D in the serum increases as 12 ng/mL ≤25(OH)D <20ng/mL or ≥20ng/mL, vitamin K1 level was signiﬁcantly associated with MSDs (95% CI0.754–0.879,95% CI0.740–0.871), while the vitamin K2 level remained similarly non-signiﬁcant (95%CI0.758–1.277,95% CI0.730–1.394).More details are shown inFigure2andSupplementaryTable3 .Mediation of vitamin A and D supplementation A mediation of the association between serum vitamin K1 and MSDthrough thevitaminAandDsupplementationmediatorwas found.The total eﬀect was highly signiﬁcant ( β= −0.024P< 0.001).Likewise,thedirectandindirecteﬀectswere β=−0.015(P <0.001)and β=−0.008(P<0.001),respectively.Theproportion of the eﬀect of vitamin K1 levels on the MSD that goes through vitamin AD supplementation is 36.8%.

Sensitive analysis Sensitivity analyses employing logistic regression models with missing values removed ( Table3, model 1) yielded similar results, indicating a negative correlation between serum vitamin K1 concentrations and MSD prevalence ( OR=0.810, 95% CI0.749– 0.876), and no signiﬁcant correlation for serum vitamin K2 concentrations ( OR=0.878, 95% CI0.648–1.190).Furthermore, the results of logistic regression models involving participants with normal birth weight (2.5–4.0kg) and gestational week (37-42 weeks)wereconsistentwiththemainﬁndings( Table3,model2).Discussion The study examined the association between serum vitamin K concentration and MSDs among preschool children in Sichuan, China.
Our ﬁndings demonstrate a signiﬁcant association between serum vitamin K1 level and MSDs, after adjusting for children’s gender, residential area, parents’ highest education, birth height, birth weight and gestational week at birth. This association attenuated to null only when 25(OH)D was below <12ng/ml.Moreover, vitamin A and D supplementation may serve as a potentialinﬂuenceontheseassociationsamongchildren.However, the serum vitamin K2 level was not associated with MSDs in anymodels.To the best of our knowledge, limited studies have addressed theassociationbetweenvitaminKandMSDsinpreschoolchildren (39–42).Our data indicate a signiﬁcant association between serum vitaminK1levelandMSDsinchildrenaged0-6years,highlighting the importance of addressing vitamin K1 deﬁciency and fostering proper nutrient supplementation and dietary habits in this population.

Based on this study, vitamin A and D supplementation is an eﬀective and feasible measure for children to partially block skeletal muscle diseasecausedbyvitaminKdeﬁciency. Though the mechanisms linking nutrients deﬁciencies and bone metabolism are not fully understood, previous studies show that vitamin K may inﬂuence bone transformation through various pathways, including osteoblast diﬀerentiation, osteoclast inhibition, and activationof bone-associated vitaminK-dependent proteins, such as osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein that play essential roles in the mineralization of extracellular bone matrix (43,53,54).During this process, bone mineralization ( 55) is Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/five.tnum frontiersin.org Ge et al.
/one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/five.tnum/four.tnum also closely related to the serum calcium levels, which can be regulated by vitamin D ( 56–58). This is consistent with our ﬁndings.It could be due to excessively low levels of vitamin D, incomplete decarboxylation of osteocalcin cannot occur which leads to inhibited bone mineralization, further manifesting as the lack of correlation between level of vitamin K and MSD occurrence.Besides,vitaminAalsoappearstoaﬀectbonehealthby simulating osteoblastic activity and inhibiting osteoclastic activity (18).Just as vitamin A and vitamin D are often used together in clinical practice, evidence shows that their pathways may overlap (59).
Based on the above knowledge, we can speculate that supplementation with vitamin A or vitamin D or a combination may be a potential mediator to mitigate the adverse eﬀects of vitamin K deﬁciency on MSDs, which is consistent with ourstudy. Our ﬁndings provide several implications for future research future research and practice.More attention should be paid to vitamin K deﬁciency in children, and vitamin A and D supplementationmayhelpmitigatetheadverseeﬀectsofvitaminK deﬁciencyonMSDs.What’smore,largeprospectivecohortsshould examinetheshort-andlong-termeﬀectsofvitaminKlevelonbone health in children.Ethically feasible clinical trials with safe doses canbeconductedtoprovidefurtherinsights.There are some strengths in this study.Firstly, we used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for vitamin K levels determination of participant from multiple regions with guaranteed consistency of measurement methods and a high detection sensitivity.
Secondly, diagnosis of MSD was conﬁrmed through physicians at the Sichuan Maternal and Child Health Hospital. The recollection bias and reporting bias has been controlled.This study is also restrained by several limitations.Firstly, the present study is a cross-sectional study that can merely show the correlation instead of causality.Secondly, despite careful adjustment for a extent range of covariates in the model, residual confoundingduetotheunavailabilityofdatamayexist.Thirdly,we only detected serum level of menaquinone-4, one of the subtypes of vitamin K2, which may underestimate level of exposure.Lastly, our study is conducted in a regional population with speciﬁc age group.We recommend exercising caution when extrapolating the ﬁndings of this study to children in other regions and agegroups.Conclusions This study found that the serum vitamin K1 levels was signiﬁcantly associated with MSDs, while the serum vitamin K2 levels were not.
It also illustrated that vitamin AD supplementation may potentially inﬂuence these associations. These ﬁndings underscore the public health signiﬁcance of vitamin A and D supplementation as a beneﬁcial intervention for preventing MSDs attributable to vitamin K1 deﬁciency inchildren.Data availability statement The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be madeavailablebytheauthors,withoutunduereservation.Ethics statement The studies involving humans were approved by Ethics Committee of Sichuan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital(2019,No.20).Thestudieswereconductedinaccordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements.Written informed consent for participation in this study was provided by theparticipants’legalguardians/nextofkin.Author contributions QG and LZ are the main researchers, who has done the major work of data analysis and collection, respectively.
