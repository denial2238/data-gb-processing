However, published observational epidemiological studies on the relationship between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Omega-3 fatty acids remain inconclusive.Here, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomisation analysis using publicly available GWAS pooled statistics to study a GWAS dataset of 16 380 466 SNPs in 23 363 cases and 195 429 controls (also of European ancestry) to determine genetic susceptibility to hypertension.
We performed random-effects Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses supplemented by a series of sensitivity assessments to measure the robustness of the findings and to detect any violations of the MR assumptions. During the course of the study, we used IVW, MR-Egger, and weighted median regression to infer that Omega-3 intake has a poten- tially adverse effect against atherosclerosis, although the trend was not significant (OR=1.1198; 95%; CI: 0.9641–1.3006, p=.130).Meanwhile, our analyses showed a statistically significant negative association between Omega-3 fatty acid levels and risk of hypertension (OR =0.9006; 95% CI: 0.8179–0.9917, p=.033).In addition, we explored the causal relationship between atherosclerosis and hypertension and found a significant correlation (OR =1.3036; 95% CI: 1.0672–1.5923, p=.009).
In conclu- sion, our extensive data investigated by MR suggest that elevated levels of Omega-3 fatty acids may be associated with an decreased risk of hypertension. Although there is no direct link between hypertension and atherosclerosis, the possibility of a subtle association cannot be categorically excluded.KEYWORDS atherosclerosis, hypertension, intermediate analysis, Mendelian randomisation, Omega-3 Yuchen Song and Qun Wang have contributed equally to this study.This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made.© 2024 The Authors.The Journal of Clinical Hypertension published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.382 wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jch J Clin Hypertens.2024;26:382–390.SONG ET AL .
383 1 INTRODUCTION Coronary Atherosclerosis (AS), the foremost adversary to human health, manifests as a progressive and multifaceted ailment. Its spec- trum ranges from silent conditions to clinical scenarios such as stable angina, Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), Heart Failure (HF), and Sud- den Cardiac Death (SCD).1World Health Organization (WHO) data indicates a trend towards a younger demographic being affected by AS, yet the elderly remain predominantly susceptible to acute cardio- vascular incidents.Hypertension stands as the most prevalent chronic condition and a pivotal contributor to AS.It is a primary driver of cardiovascular morbidity and global premature mortality.A compre- hensive study encompassing 250 741 individuals across 13 nations revealed a prehypertension prevalence of 40% in males, with 36.1% of hypertensive men and 62.1% of hypertensive women undergoing phar- macological management to mitigate blood pressure levels.
Emerging evidence suggests that vascular calcification (VC) plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of both atherosclerosis and hypertension, with the latter being a critical element in coronary artery disease progression.2Consequently, the strategic reduction of blood pressure is imperative in curtailing the risks associated with hypertension and coronary events.
According to the AHA/ACC guidelines, the diagnostic criteria for hypertension are systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥80 mmHg, with SBP ≥140 mmHg or DBP ≥90 mmHg as the diagnostic criterion for grade 2 hyperten- sion.Hypertension (HTN) is one of the major risk factors for atheroscle- rotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).Also, HTN is the world’s leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease, stroke, disability and death.3Firstly, it has been shown that when blood pressure is ele- vated, the protective endothelial barrier is impaired, which causes lipid deposition to form AS, and the process of AS is associated with oxida- tive stress (OS) and inflammatory immune response. In hypertensive patients, up-regulation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which further generates OS, and in the process induces low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) production, con- tributing to the development of ASCVD.
In addition, HTN patients have higher angiotensin II activity, and Ang II-activated nuclear factor (HF)- κB inflammatory pathway can cause vascular endothelial dysfunction, which in turn induces ASCVD.4 Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( ω-3 PUFAs), encompassing alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and its metabolic progenies eicosapen- taenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are classified as “essential” fatty acids. These are predominantly sourced from dietary inclusions such as plant oils, marine organisms, and commercial fish oil supplements.5Omega-3 PUFAs orchestrate blood pressure modu- lation via diverse mechanisms.They facilitate vascular function regu- lation through the liberation of Omega-3 PUFA metabolites, including EPA and DHA derivatives (17,18-epoxy-EPA and 19,20-epoxy-DHA), which bolster vasoreactivity in cardiomyocytes, thus aiding in the man- agement of cardiovascular conditions like hypertension.
In endothelial cells (ECs), Omega-3 PUFAs, in concert with EPA, can enhance nitric oxide (NO) synthesis via endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation,promoting vasodilation in arterioles and contributing to antihyper- tensive effects.5It has been shown that rapid and direct effects of Omega-3 PUFA include Ca2+-independent eNOS activation; transloca- tion and dissociation of Caveolin-1 from eNOS in endothelial cells6;a n d activation of TRPV4-type Ca2+-permeable ion channels in endothelial cells, which improves flow-mediated vasodilatation7and further pro- tects cardiac and aortic tissue.8Regarding AS, longitudinal studies have demonstrated that a 30-month regimen of EPA +DHA is associated with triglyceride reduction and the regression of coronary lipid-rich plaques.9 The efficacy of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), par- ticularly linoleic acids (LAs), in thwarting CVD has been met with considerable debate.
Syntheses of clinical trial data have yielded incon- clusive results, suggesting that an increase in n-6 PUFA intake does not correlate with a diminished incidence of coronary heart disease events,10,11and the robustness of this evidence has been questioned.
While diets combining n-3 and n-6 PUFAs have been linked to favorable outcomes in some randomized controlled trials, diets rich exclusively in n6 PUFAs have not demonstrated the same protective benefits.12 Cohort studies have observed a beneficial link between n-3 PUFA con- sumption and cardiovascular health,13yet randomized trials present as p e c t r u mo ff i n d i n g s .14,15Notably, a substantial trial ( n=25 871) discerned that while daily n-3 PUFA supplementation (1 g/day) did not curtail major cardiovascular events, it significantly lowered the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases over an average span of 5.3 years, prompting further inquiry into the underlying protective mecha- nisms of Omega-3 against cardiovascular and coronary artery disease (CAD).16 In recent years it has been shown that Omega-3 fatty acids have blood pressure-lowering, antithrombotic, inflammatory status- improving, and endothelial-protective properties, which in turn sug- gests that Omega-3 fatty acids have a better efficacy in improving both the composition and stability of coronary atherosclerotic plaques,17 thus further demonstrating that Omega-3 fatty acids are associated with the additional benefit of lowering blood pressure.18 This investigation targets hypertension and coronary atheroscle- rosis as the outcomes, with Omega-3 fatty acids as the exposures of interest in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to discern potential causative links.
The objective is to lay a foundational theory for subsequent inquiries into the intricate mechanisms and risk factors associated with Omega-3 fatty acids. 2 METHODS 2.1 Study design To elucidate the putative causal nexus between Omega-3 levels, hyper- tension, and atherosclerosis, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was adopted.The study harnessed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables (IVs).This SNP- centric methodology mirrors the principles of randomized controlled trials and is instrumental in pinpointing causal relationships between 384 SONG ET AL .the exposure factors—namely, Omega-3 and hypertension—and the outcome of atherosclerosis.2.2 Study design drawings A Mendelian Randomization Approach between Omega-3 Fatty Acids and cardiovascular disease.2.3 Ethics and data use statement The current investigation incorporated data from prior studies that had received approval from the appropriate institutional review boards.
Participants in the original studies provided informed consent, as documented in ref. [ 18].Therefore, no further ethical permissions were required for this analysis, as noted in ref.[ 19].Nonetheless, we obtained ethical clearance from our institutional review board and ensured informed consent from all participants involved in our study.2.4 Genetic instrument variants for exposure Our analysis employed 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with Omega-3 fatty acid levels from the FinnGen dataset of Finland.The inclusion criterion for the SNPs was a significant associ- ation with Omega-3 fatty acids at a p-value threshold of less than 5 × 10−8.2.5 GWAS summary data for hypertension and atherosclerosis For hypertension, we accessed data from the FinnGen dataset, encom- passing 16 379 784 SNPs.The comprehensive GWAS summary data for hypertension can be found at https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/datasets/finn- b-O15/ , which includes a cohort of 7686 cases and 115 893 controls.
The cohort comprised European individuals diagnosed with hyperten-sion, defined as having a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher, or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher. Additionally, we utilized data on atherosclerosis from the same dataset.The diagnostic criteria for atherosclerosis were based on a comprehensive blood glucose and lipid profile assessment, evidence of calcium deposits via x-ray, atheromatous plaque presence confirmed by arteriography, or Doppler ultrasound detection.This dataset, which includes 23 363 cases and 195 429 controls, is accessible at https:// gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/datasets/finn-b-I9/ , representing a population of European individuals diagnosed with atherosclerosis.2.6 Screening of instrumental variables The selection of SNPs was conducted with scrupulous attention to detail.Initially, SNPs demonstrating a robust association with levothy- roxine sodium were selected, meeting the genome-wide significance threshold of p<5×10−8.
To ensure the independence of the SNPs and to minimize the influence of linkage disequilibrium (LD), we ensured that the SNPs were independent by implementing a stringent r2cri- terion of 0.01 within a 10 000 kb range. This step was critical to reduce the potential bias introduced by LD.Additionally, the relation- ship between the instrumental variables (IVs) and the exposure was quantified using the F-statistic for each SNP, with IVs exhibiting an F-statistic greater than 10 considered to provide unbiased estimates.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The primary method of analysis was the IVW approach, which is predi- cated on the assumption that all SNPs are valid IVs, thus providing the most accurate estimates.In instances where any SNP does not conform to the IV assumption, a modified version known as the random-effects IVW method is utilized.This method adjusts each estimate based on its standard error, thereby accounting for potential heterogeneity.
The weighted median approach requires that a minimum of 50% of the SNPs are valid to maintain the integrity of the instrumental vari- able assumption. The median of the corresponding distribution was SONG ET AL .385 FIGURE 1 Forest plot of results of Mendelian randomisation analysis.determined by ranking the SNPs according to their weights and exam- ining the experimental outcomes.Furthermore, the MR-Egger regres- sion, which does not depend on the absence of pleiotropic effects, was used to derive an effect estimate.The extent of the pleiotropic effect was assessed using the intercept from the MR-Egger regression, with a nonsignificant deviation from zero indicating no evidence of a directional pleiotropic bias.4 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The random-effects IVW method served as the cornerstone of our ana- lytical approach to discern the causal links between sex factors and Omega-3 fatty acid levels.
This method amalgamates the Wald ratio estimates for each SNP to derive a causal estimate for each risk fac- tor, yielding reliable estimates in the absence of pleiotropy. A suite of sensitivity analyses was conducted to corroborate the associations.The weighted median method was employed, which requires only half of the SNPs to be valid instruments, and the MR-Egger approach was utilized to accommodate a nonzero intercept, indicative of pleiotropy.The MR-PRESSO test was introduced to identify potential outliers, with adjustments made by excluding such SNPs.If the adjusted effect aligns with the uncorrected effect, the IVW-MR estimates are deemed robust.However, significant discrepancies warrant preference for the adjusted effects, as they are likely to be less biased and more reflective of the true relationship.A two-stage MR analysis was implemented to evaluate mediation effects.
The first stage involved using a genetic instrument for the sex factor to estimate the causal impact of exposure on the mediator. The second stage employed genetic instruments for the mediator to ascertain the causal effect on the risk of developing hypertension and atherosclerosis.The causal effects of Omega-3 on the risk of hypertension and atherosclerosis were presented using odds ratios (ORs), beta coef- ficients ( β), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).MR and sensitivity analyses were performed using R software (version 4.2.1) and the “TwoSampleMR” package (version 0.5.6).In the univariate MR analy- ses, a p-value of<1.25×10−2(adjusted for multiple comparisons as 0.05 divided by the number of exposures and outcomes, 2 ×2) was considered indicative of a statistically significant causal relationship.
5 RESULTS 5.1 Omega-3 fatty acids and their influence on atherosclerosis 5.1.1 Selection of instrumental variables for Omega-3 fatty acid levels The genetic markers indicative of Omega-3 fatty acid levels are delin- eated in Figure 1. A total of 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were meticulously chosen as instrumental variables (IVs).Each of these genetic markers surpassed the threshold for genome-wide significance ( p<5×10−8) and exhibited robust instrument strength (F-statistic>10).The influence of each SNP on atherosclerosis risk is graphically represented in Forest Plot and Scatter Diagram (Figure 2).5.1.2 Mendelian randomization analysis: Omega-3’s role in atherosclerosis Through the application of IVW analysis, MR-Egger regression, and weighted median approaches, we probed the potential causal link 386 SONG ET AL .FIGURE 2 The forward MR analyses: Casual effect of Omega-3 fatty acids and their influence on hypertension and coronary atherosclerosis.

Complementary analyses via MR-Egger regression yielded similar results (OR =1.11937; 95% CI: 0.9069– 1.3817, p=.290).5.1.3 Verification of Mendelian randomization assumptions Our analytical approach entailed a stringent selection of SNPs, adher- ing to the genome-wide significance criterion ( p<5×10−8). This strategy provided substantial evidence negating the presence of direc- tional pleiotropy, thereby upholding the integrity of the second MR 388 SONG ET AL .assumption ( p=.996).Moreover, the MR heterogeneity test revealed significant variability in the data ( p=3.66E-52), underscoring the need for cautious interpretation.Collectively, our rigorous evaluation of MR’s core postulates confirmed the suitability of the chosen SNPs as genetic instruments.Consequently, the inferred associations between Omega-3 levels predicted by these genetic markers and atheroscle- rosis remained unobscured by any discernible confounding factors or intermediaries.
5.2 The impact of Omega-3 on hypertension 5.2.1 Determination of instrumental variables for Omega-3 levels The genetic determinants for Omega-3 levels are cataloged in Figure 1. From the pool of candidates, we identified and selected 49 SNPs to serve as instrumental variables (IVs).These genetic markers met the criteria for genome-wide significance ( p<5×10−8) and demonstrated sufficient statistical power ( F-statistic>10).The individual impact of these SNPs on hypertension is depicted in the corresponding Forest Plot and Scatter Diagram (Figure 2).5.2.2 Mendelian randomization evaluation of Omega-3’s effect on hypertension Utilizing the IVW method, MR-Egger regression, and weighted median analysis, we investigated the causal influence of Omega-3 levels on hypertension.The IVW analysis indicated a modest reduction in the risk of hypertension associated with higher Omega-3 levels (IVW, OR=0.9006; 95% CI: 0.8179 −0.9917, p=.033).
Results from alterna- tive MR-Egger methods also supported this finding, albeit with wider confidence intervals (OR =0.8984; 95% CI: 0.7845–1.0287, p=.130). 5.2.3 Validation of the Mendelian randomization framework Our SNP selection process was governed by the established genome- wide significance benchmark ( p<5×10−8), which provided a robust foundation for the absence of directional pleiotropy, thereby main- taining the validity of the second MR assumption ( p=.958).The heterogeneity test within the MR framework also indicated signifi- cant variability ( p=.004), warranting a nuanced interpretation of the results.In essence, our comprehensive validation of the MR method- ology’s core principles affirmed the appropriateness of the selected SNPs as genetic proxies.
This ensured that the deduced relationship between Omega-3 levels and hypertension was free from the influence of unrecognized confounders or intermediate variables.5.3 Interrelation of hypertension and atherosclerosis 5.3.1 Selection of instrumental variables for hypertension The genetic imprints of hypertension are detailed in Figure 1. A concise set of 5 SNPs was meticulously chosen as instrumental variables (IVs).These genetic indicators surpassed the threshold for genome-wide significance ( p<5×10−8) and exhibited robust statistical strength (F-statistic>10).The influence of these genetic variants on atheroscle- r o s i si sv i s u a l l yp r e s e n t e di n( F i g u r e 2), through Forest and Scatter plots.5.3.2 Mendelian randomization analysis for atherosclerosis The causal nexus between hypertension and atherosclerosis was scru- tinized using methods such as IVW analysis, MR-Egger regression, and weighted median regression.
The IVW method unveiled a paradoxical association, indicating a heightened risk of atherosclerosis in individ- uals with hypertension (IVW, OR =1.3036; 95% CI: 1.0672 −1.5923, p=.009). Conversely, MR-Egger analysis depicted a nonsignificant trend (OR =0.6372; 95% CI: 0.3511–1.1565, p=.230), suggesting the need for cautious interpretation.5.3.3 Verification of Mendelian randomization presumptions Our SNP selection adhered to the stringent criterion of genome- wide significance ( p<5×10−8), which substantiated the nonex- istence of directional pleiotropy, thereby upholding the integrity of the second MR postulate ( p=.094).The MR heterogene- ity test further revealed significant diversity within the observed effects ( p=.002).Collectively, our meticulous evaluation of the MR framework’s foundational postulates confirmed the suitabil- ity of the chosen SNPs as genetic instruments.
Consequently, the deduced associations between genetically inferred hypertension and atherosclerosis remained unobscured by latent confounders or intermediaries. In an extensive data retrieval exercise, our investigation cata- loged 49 SNPs associated with omega3 levels.Moreover, a vast array of 16 380 466 SNPs were linked to hypertension, and a comparable magnitude of 16 379 784 SNPs were related to coro- nary atherosclerosis.This dataset included the magnitude of each SNP’s effect on principal component analysis, effect sizes, and stan- dard errors, providing a comprehensive genetic landscape of these conditions.SONG ET AL .389 6 DISCUSSION Acknowledging the multifaceted role of Omega-3 fatty acids, our study stands at the forefront of elucidating the intricate biological mechanisms that link these fatty acids to the risk of hypertension and coronary atherosclerosis.
Leveraging the power of integrative GWAS analyses with the FinnGen database, we have uncovered a direct influence of Omega-3 fatty acids on hypertension risk, while also highlighting their indirect role in the development of coronary atherosclerosis. This research is instrumental in deepening our under- standing of the causal relationships between Omega-3 fatty acids, hypertension, and coronary atherosclerosis pathogenesis, as well as the complex interplay between these conditions within a genomic context.
Moreover, our findings are in harmony with existing literature that identifies the Omega-3 index as a risk marker for sudden car- diac death, suggesting that monitoring the Omega-3 index could serve as a valuable indicator for the management of hypertension and coronary atherosclerosis.19–21In line with our conclusions, other studies have demonstrated that high-dose EPA formulations confer significant cardiovascular protection, targeting the residual risk asso- ciated with triglyceride- rich lipoproteins.5The benefits of Omega-3 PUFAs may transcend triglyceride reduction, encompassing a broad array of pleiotropic effects such as mitigating vascular inflammation and thrombosis, enhancing endothelial function, and lowering blood pressure.5,21Empirical evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as human clinical trials, indicates that Omega-3 PUFAs can positively influence vascular responses, both endothelium-dependent and independent, potentially improving peripheral vascular resistance and thus offering therapeutic benefits for hypertension and coro- nary atherosclerosis.5,21Secondly, it has been shown that Omega- 3 PUFA can effectively improve the elasticity of large arteries by enhancing the production or release of NO, thereby further reduc- ing blood pressure by vasodilating blood vessels.22In addition, it has been concluded that in animal and human studies, Omega-3 PUFA improve normal and damaged endothelial function, and thus hyper- tension, primarily by increasing NO availability through activation of eNOS.23 Our investigation reveals a significant correlation between Omega- 3 fatty acids and the heightened risk of hypertension development.
Omega-3 fatty acids are recognized for their therapeutic application in managing hyperlipidemia and hypertension.24Studies have indicated that an augmented intake of Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N3- PUFA) correlates with a diminished risk of mortality from all causes and cardiovascular events in hypertensive adults within the United States. These findings propose that elevating dietary N3-PUFA levels could represent a viable approach to curtailing mortality associated with hypertension.25 Furthermore, our research delineates a direct correlation between the propensity for hypertension and the emergence of coronary atherosclerosis.
The interconnection between blood pressure and atherosclerosis is evident, with increased arterial wall stress due to heightened blood pressure exacerbating atherosclerotic conditions.Conversely, atherosclerosis may arise from the development of athero- matous plaques in regions subjected to intensified stress as a result of elevated blood pressure.26While hypertension is characterized by abnormally high blood pressure, numerous studies have substanti- ated that blood pressure reduction significantly mitigates the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases and mortality.24One partic- ular study assessed carotid-femoral (cf) and femoral-ankle (fa) pulse wave velocities across 4166 adults, deducing that persistently elevated blood pressure contributes to the pathogenesis of arterial stiffness.27 In recent years, increased intake of Omega-3 fatty acids is effective in reducing plaque formation and thus improving coronary atheroscle- rosis.
Omega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are being attempted to intervene in coronary atherosclerotic disease, and it has been shown that patients treated with EPA have been found to have a greater increase in fibre volume and a greater decrease in liposome volume in both the studies, resulting in an intervention in coronary atherosclerosis.28The EVAPORATE trial (2020), which treated 80 patients with either ethyl eicosapentaenoate (a purified ethyl EPA) or OMT and looked at plaque regression, concluded that the ethyl eicosapentaenoate group had significantly greater plaque regres- sion (−9.0% vs.+11.0%; p<.05) and a reduction in low-attenuation plaques, fibrofatty volume and fibre volume29. This seems to consti- tute an important therapeutic option for plaque abatement in future clinical practice.The strengths of our two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) study are manifold.
Primarily, we utilized robust MR analytical meth- ods, selecting SNPs with a high association strength as instrumental variables, akin to the experimental framework of a randomized con- trolled trial. Secondly, we opted for independent, potent genetic variants as IVs to circumvent potential confounders and enhance the precision of our results.However, our study is not without its limitations.The GWAS data encompassed subjects exclusively of European descent, necessitating additional research to ascertain the applicability of our conclusions to diverse populations.Moreover, the incidence of hypertension and coronary atherosclerosis exhibited gender-specific disparities.Regret- tably, the public databases from which our data were sourced did not permit detailed subgroup analyses for particular demographics, such as age and gender.
In summation, our research provides a comprehensive demonstra- tion of the causal links between Omega-3 fatty acids, hypertension risk, and coronary atherosclerosis development. We identified a negative association between Omega-3 fatty acids and hypertension risk, and a positive association between hypertension and coronary atherosclero- sis, alongside a positive relationship between Omega-3s and coronary atherosclerosis.Omega-3 fatty acids may emerge as novel biomark- ers, offering fresh perspectives on the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Qun Wang : Methodology.Yuchen Song : Formal analysis and investi- gation.Yuchen Song : Writing—original draft preparation.Lianqun Jia : Funding acquisition.Qun Wang : Resources.Lianqun Jia : Supervision.390 SONG ET AL .And all authors commented on previous versions of the manuscript.All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
