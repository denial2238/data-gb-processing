We next used this mutantmouse strain as a tool to ask whether any of the symptomsobserved in GLAST- deﬁcient patients might be due, in part, to the absence of glutamate signaling in osteoblasts. We fo-cused on cognition because this central function is impairedinGLAST- deﬁcient subjects, and it is regulated by osteocal- cin.We observed that Glast osb-/-mice had a severe cogni- tive impairment.To de ﬁne more precisely the contribution of bone to the cognitive defect caused by theabsence of GLAST, we relied on both pharmacological andgenetic experiments.First, we treated WT mice with aGlast inhibitor that does not cross the blood-brain barrier(BBB) and therefore, does not affect any brain structure,or with another Glast inhibitor that crosses the BBB.
Inthe conditions of this experiment, only the Glast inhibitorthat does not cross the BBB impaired cognition in WTmice, further suggesting that glutamate signaling regu-lates behavior in part by regulating the release of active os-teocalcin from bone. To strengthen these results, we arecurrently comparing cognition functions in mutant mice lacking Glast in glial cells or neurons.
Together, our obser- vations illustrate the important functions played by of glu-tamate in osteoblasts and suggest that some behavioralphenotype caused by the absence of GLAST in humansmay originate, at least in part, from the disruption of gluta-mate signaling in the skeleton.Abstract citation ID: bvae163.515 Bone and Mineral Metabolism 9268The Pro-atrophic Effect of Vitamin D Binding Proteinin Skeletal Muscle and Its Involvement inCancer-Induced Muscle Wasting Nicoletta Filigheddu, PhD, Tommaso Raiteri, PhD, Simone Reano, PhD, Andrea Scircoli, MSc,Alessandro Antonioli, MSc, and Flavia Prodam, MD, PhDUniversity of Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy Disclosure: N.

In addition,VDBP enhances the chemotactic activity of neutrophil che-moattractants and takes part in the actin-scavenger sys-tem by acting as a monomeric G-actin-binding protein.Several studies have reported a correlation between in-creased levels of VDBP and various pathologies often asso-ciated with muscle wasting, including different types oftumors. Given these ﬁndings, we hypothesized that VDBP may play a role in skeletal muscle homeostasis.In vitro , treatment of C2C12 myotubes with 100 mM VDBP for 24h induced the perturbation of intracellular actin dynamicsdue to VDBP ’s ability to bind G-actin that, in turn, led to mitochondrial dysfunction ( i.e., mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, respiratory impairment, increasedROS production, induction of the ﬁssion machinery), ex- acerbation of autophagy, and, eventually, atrophy, seen as the reduction of myotube diameter.
Remarkably,pharmacological intervention on myotubes with jasplakino-lide (250 mM, 30 min pre-treatment) to counteract VDBPeffects on intracellular actin dynamics was suf ﬁcient to pre- vent VDBP-induced atrophy. To assess if VDBP had acausative role in muscle atrophy in vivo , we injected VDBP (1.5 mg/Kg) every 48 h for one week in the tibialis an- terior muscles of Gcknock-out mice (VDBP KO).At the end of the experimental period, we observed the induction of themitophagic gene Bnip3 , impairment of muscle performan- ces (26% reduction of grip strength at the endpoint), anda 16% reduction of muscle mass compared to thesaline-injected contralateral muscles, con ﬁrming the atro- phic effect of VDBP in vivo .Coherently with the upregula- tion of VDBP observed in cancer patients, VDBP levelsalso increase in murine models of cancer cachexia.
To testthe hypothesis that VDBP could play a role in cancer-associated muscle wasting, we induced cancer cachexia inVDBP KO mice by inoculating 10 6Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells resuspended in 100 μl of saline on the back of mice. Tumor-bearing VDBP KO mice preserved their bodyweight and performances, and the muscle loss was lessenedby more than 50% compared to cachectic WT mice.Notably,between the two groups, there were no differences in tumorgrowth or food intake, ruling out the possibility that the re-duction in muscle wasting could depend on smaller tumorsor differential development of anorexia in the two geno-types.In conclusion, we demonstrated that VDBP acts asa hormone per se , having a direct pro-atrophic activity onJournal of the Endocrine Society | https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvae163 | A273 J Endocrine Soc, Volume 8, Issue Supplement_1, October –November 2024 A273 skeletal muscle.
