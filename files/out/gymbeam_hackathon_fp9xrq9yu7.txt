Article2023;87:97–104 The Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research 97Introduction Iron is an essential element for all living organisms (1).Some of its most studied functions include oxygen transport and storage, electron transfer, hormone synthesis, DNA replication, cell cycle control, nitrogen fixation, and antioxidant properties (2,3).Iron is also important for bacteria because several virulence factors and replication constituents are influenced by iron levels (4,5).Inflammatory processes, such as bacterial infections and endotox- emia, can lead to a decrease in serum iron levels, which is a nonspe- cific innate immune response to control bacterial infections (5,6).Low iron concentrations can reduce bacterial DNA and RNA synthesis and their growth and sporogenesis, resulting in changes in bacterial morphology (5).Although the iron content of equine diets varies considerably, it is usually adequate for daily requirements and deficiency is uncommon in adult horses (7,8).
A decrease in plasma iron concentration has been observed in experimentally induced inflammatory diseases in horses (9). Hypoferremia, which is mediated by hepcidin expression, can therefore be used as a sensitive indicator of acute, subacute, and chronic inflammation (10–12).Iron deficiency in performance horses remains a concern for train- ers, owners, and veterinarians who frequently use iron- enriched feed supplements, despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting this Effect of dietary iron supplementation on the equine fecal microbiome Julia Assis Arantes, Alexandre Secorun Borges, Luiza Stachewski Zakia, Michael Gordon Surette, Jeffrey Scott Weese, Marcio Carvalho Costa, Luis Guillermo Arroyo Abstract Iron is an essential element for all living organisms, including bacteria, as several virulence factors and replication components are influenced by iron concentration.
The objective of this study was to determine whether the composition and diversity of the fecal microbiota of adult horses are affected by supplemental dietary iron. Ten clinically healthy horses were randomly divided into a control and an iron-supplemented group ( n = 5).The treated group was supplemented with oral ferrous sulphate monohydrate (720 ppm of iron), whereas the control group received 320 ppm of iron daily for 15 d.Fecal samples were collected before and 5, 10, 15, and 30 d after supplementation and frozen at 280°C.DNA was sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform and data were analyzed using the software Mothur and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe).Iron supplementation caused no change in the overall composition of the fecal microbiota, but some minor changes were observed in the low-abundant bacteria, as well as an increased alpha diversity after 15 d of supplementation.
Significant differences in community composition of the fecal microbiota over time were observed in both groups, highlighting the importance of a control group, as there are variables that cannot be controlled in microbiome studies. Résumé Le fer est un élément essentiel pour tous les organismes vivants, y compris les bactéries, car plusieurs facteurs de virulence et composants de réplication sont influencés par la concentration en fer.L ’objectif de cette étude était de déterminer si la composition et la diversité du microbiote fécal des chevaux adultes sont affectées par la supplémentation en fer alimentaire.Dix chevaux cliniquement sains ont été divisés au hasard en un groupe témoin et un groupe supplémenté en fer, n = 5 par groupe.Le groupe traité a reçu un supplément oral de sulfate ferreux monohydraté (720 ppm de fer) et le groupe témoin a reçu 320 ppm de fer par jour pendant 15 jours.
Des échantillons fécaux ont été prélevés avant la supplémentation et 5, 10, 15 et 30 jours après la supplémentation puis congelés à 280 °C. L ’ ADN a été séquencé à l’aide de la plateforme Illumina MiSeq et les données ont été analysées à l’aide des logiciels Mothur et analyse de la fonction discriminante linéaire taille de l’effet LefSe.La supplémentation en fer n’a provoqué aucun changement dans la composition du microbiote fécal, mais certains changements ont été observés chez les bactéries peu abondantes, ainsi qu’une augmentation de la diversité alpha après 15 jours de supplémentation.Au fil du temps, des différences significatives dans la composition de la communauté bactérienne ont été observées dans les deux groupes, soulignant l’importance d’un groupe témoin, car il existe des variables qui ne peuvent être contrôlées dans les études sur le microbiome.

Excessive iron concentration can affect metabolism and cause hepatopathy in adult horses and hepatopathy and necrosis in the stomach and small intestine in foals (14–17).Since iron is largely used by bacteria, iron supplementation may directly affect the host microbiota, as described in humans (1).However, no study has yet described the effects of excessive dietary iron and its potential effect on the gastrointestinal microbiota in horses.In humans, piglets, and mice, excess dietary iron can have del - eterious effects, such as compositional changes in gut microbiota, induced oxidative stress, altered gut immune response, higher fre - quency of diarrhea, abdominal pain, damage to the intestinal villi and intestinal barrier, and ulcer and necrosis of the mucosa of the upper gastrointestinal tract (18–22).
Gastrointestinal disorders are among the most important diseases in horses (23) and the potential effects of high iron intake on the microbiota are of clinical interest. The objective of this study was to determine whether the composition and diversity of the fecal microbiota of adult horses are affected by supplemental dietary iron.Materials and methods Animals and experimental design Ten clinically healthy horses were randomly divided into 2 groups of 5 horses each: the control group (no iron supplementation) and the dietary iron -supplemented group.The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Ontario Veterinary College (OVC).Horses were clinically healthy based on physical examination, complete blood (cell) count, and serum biochemistry profile and no antibiotic was given in the 3 mo before the start of the study.Horses were dewormed 15 d before the experiment and the feces were tested for parasite eggs.
The horses were kept on -pasture for 20 d before the study and were given hay ad libitum, as well as water and a mineral salt block. For 1 h each day, the horses were kept in stalls (10 m2) that were lined with rubber mats.Each horse was fed 1 kg of a concentrate ration.The concentration of iron in the feed and water was measured to obtain a baseline.Horses with no supplementation received a diet with 320 ppm of iron.The iron- supplemented group received 720 ppm iron (ferrous sulphate monohydrate 4000 mg) mixed with the concentrate from day zero to Day 15.Fecal samples were collected from the rectum with a rectal sleeve the day before iron supplementation (Day 2 1) and then on days 5, 10, and 15 and again 30 d after the first iron administration (Day 30).Feces were stored in sterile containers and frozen at 2 80°C immediately after sampling.
Molecular protocol DNA for microbiota analysis was extracted from 200 mg of fecal samples, taken from the center of fecal balls using the E.Z.N.A. Stool DNA Kit with glass beads (Omega Bio- Tek, Norcross, Georgia, Figure 1.Relative abundance of the main bacterial phylum found in feces of iron- supplemented (iron group) and control horses (control group) during sampling periods.D -1: 1 d before iron administration; D5: 5 d after the first iron admin- istration; D10: 10 d after the first iron administration; D15: 15 d after the first iron administration; and D30: 15 d after the end of iron administration.2000;64:0–00 The Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research 99USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.DNA was quantified using the NanoDrop ND- 1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, Delaware, USA) and normal- ized to 50 ng/mL.
The V4 region of the 16 rRNA gene was amplified by poly- merase chain reaction (PCR) and the products were sequenced using the Illumina platform as described in a previous study (24). Bioinformatics analysis was conducted using Mothur software, fol- lowing MiSeq standard operating procedure (SOP) (25).Briefly, origi - nal FASTQ files were assembled into contigs, excluding sequences longer than 325 bp, those with base-pair ambiguities, and those with polymers longer than 8 bp.The sequences were aligned using the SILVA 16S rRNA reference database (26) and chimeras were identi - fied and removed.Sequences were then grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the same genus.The taxonomic classification was obtained from the RDP data - base (Ribosomal Database Project) (27).Readings classified as the same genus were grouped into phylotypes.Alpha diversity indices, including Chao, Inverse Simpson, and Shannon, were calculated.
Beta diversity was compared between groups using the Jaccard similarity index to see membership (genera present or absent, without regard to their abundance) and the Yue and Clayton measure of dissimilar - ity to see structure (genera and their relative abundance).Statistical analysis Bacteria in the 2 groups were compared at different taxonomic levels using an unpaired Student’s t -test after the data were normal- ized. The similarity of bacterial communities between groups was compared using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA).In addi- tion, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) was used to analyze the differences in relative abundance at the genus level.Combining statistical significance with biological consistency and effect size estimation, this approach considers associations between each genus and the experimental groups.
Results Horses Horses in the treated group tolerated the iron-concentrate mixture well (720 ppm of daily intake), with no apparent change in their appetite or behavior. Microbiota analyses Analysis of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene sequencing.A total of 3 729 383 reads from 50 samples passed all quality filters and were used for the final analyses.Based on the sample with the lowest Figure 2.Relative abundance of the main bacterial genera ( ..1%) in feces of iron- supplemented (iron group) and control horses (control group) during sampling periods.D -1: 1 d before iron administration; D5: 5 d after the first iron administration; D10: 10 d after the first iron administration; D15: 15 d after the first iron administration; and D30: 15 d after the end of iron administration.100 The Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research 2000;64:0–00number of reads, a quantity of 5193 reads was used as a cut -off for subsampling to reduce the bias caused by non- uniform samples.
After subsampling, the average coverage was 99.54% (SD 0.06%), indicating that the analysis was able to detect most genera present in these fecal samples. Relative abundance and LEfSe analysis.The mean relative abun- dance of bacterial phylum and genera accounting for more than 1% of the total reads in feces of iron- supplemented and control groups from Days 0 to 30 is shown in Figures 1 and 2.Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the most prevalent phyla in both groups on all days analyzed.The 15 most common genera in the samples together represented 87.9% of all sequences.The most abundant taxa classi - fied at lower taxonomic levels included unclassified Lachnospiraceae, unclassified Ruminococcaceae, unclassified Bacteroidetes, and unclas- sified Bacteroidales, for both groups on all days analyzed.For bacteria with a relative abundance .1%, there was no associa- tion between the iron -supplemented group and the control group.
However, for bacteria with low relative abundance ( , 1%), differ - ences between the 2 groups [linear discriminant analysis (LDA) . 2] are shown in Figure 3.There were differences for the most abundant genera only when each group was compared individually over time (day 5 3 day 10), e.g., Lachnospiraceae and the unclassified Subdivision 5 (LDA .2).Excluding the bacteria that were already significantly different between groups on Day 2 1, i.e., Alloprevotella, Streptococcus, Anaeroplasma, and Ruminococcus, there were 7 taxa associated with the iron group and 13 taxa associated with the con- trol group (LDA .2).Alpha diversity.To assess alpha diversity and observed genera, the Chao index (richness estimator) and Inverse Simpson and Shannon indices (diversity estimators) were used at the genus level of taxonomy.The diversity addressed by the Simpson index was significantly higher in the iron -supplemented horses compared to controls on Day 15 ( P = 0.046) (Figure 4 and Table I).
On the other sampling days, there were no differences in the observed genera, Inverse Simpson index, or either the Chao or the Shannon indices when all samples from the iron group were compared to those from the control group (Table I). Beta diversity.There was no significant difference in beta diversity membership or structure between the iron group and the control group during all sampling periods (all P -values .0.05).This is con - sistent with the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) membership plot (Figure 5) and structure plot, which showed no clusters or dissimilari- ties between the control group and the iron group.A significant time effect was noted when all horses (iron group and control group) were analyzed together and by group and when Day 5 was compared to Day 10 ( P # 0.05) and Day 10 was compared to Day 15 ( P # 0.05).Figure 3.Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis representing bacterial taxa statistically associated (LDA score ..

Conversely, changes have been reported in gut or fecal microbiota of humans, piglets, and mice supplemented with iron (18–20,22,28,29). Some of these studies differ in one or more factors, however, such as the amount of iron supplementation, the variation in iron levels between the treated group and the control group, and the type of oral iron supplementation given.Among other factors that might contribute to fewer changes are the type of diet, since horses are the only herbivores and fermenters of the animals studied, as well as the amount of iron in the diets of the other species and the differences in microbiota composition.Dietary iron levels in horses differ considerably and usually vary from enough iron to a high level of the daily requirement (7,8).Excess dietary iron is uncommon in humans, especially in develop- ing countries (1,30).Similarly, iron intake is usually low in weaning piglets (21,22).
Other species may react more strongly to iron supple- mentation because their diets have less variation in iron concentra- tion and, when this occurs, they tend to be below the required level. Iron concentration can vary in a horse’s diet, however, it is often above the required level so that supplementation may have a less profound effect on the microbiota.The iron content of the diet fed to all horses before enrollment in the study was higher than the recommended daily requirement of 40 ppm for adult horses.The iron- supplemented group received approximately 18 times more iron than the daily requirement with- out causing marked differences in the fecal microbiome.We need Figure 4.Alpha diversity at genus level of taxonomy represented by Inverse Simpson Index at Day 15 (15 d after the first iron administration for the iron group).Black circles: 5 horses of the control group.Black squares: 5 horses of the iron group.Bars represent the mean and SD.

40 ppm), it remains to be determined whether iron supplementation could cause a significant difference in the fecal microbiota of horses with lower dietary iron levels. Although the iron supplemented, and controls groups did not dif - fer in the relative abundance of phyla or the most abundant genera (.1%) low abundant taxa were significantly affected.Similarly, one study showed most differences were in bacteria with low abun - dance (31), but other studies reported significant changes in bacteria with higher relative abundance (28,32).The relative abundance of unclassified Sphingomonadacae, Clostridium sensu strictu, Anaerobacter, unclassified Oxalobacteraceae, Phascolarctobacterium, and Pseudomonas was higher in horses after iron supplementation than in the control group.Other studies have reported that although the genera affected after iron supplementa - tion may vary, one of the main bacteria reported to change is the genus Lactobacillus (19,20,28).This was not observed herein.
A higher, but not significant, relative abundance of Clostridium sensu strictu was reported in pigs after iron supplementation (28) and Pseudomonas was described as an important bacterium that is regulated by iron concentration (5). A higher relative abundance of C.sensu strictu was also observed in horses supplemented with psyllium (33), Phascolarctobacterium in horses with colitis (not sig - nificant) (34) and in obese, older horses (35), and Pseudomonas in horses that were more susceptible to Strongylus infections (36).This suggests that these bacteria may also be associated with cer - tain conditions or diseases.The role of the other bacteria in horses is unknown (37).An increase in alpha diversity was observed in the iron- supplemented group at Day 15 using the Inverse Simpson index.This was unexpected since diversity usually decreases after antimi - crobial treatments (38) and nutritional changes (39) or gastrointestinal Figure 5.

The iron group is represented by square dots and the control group by circular dots.D-1: 1 d before iron administration; D5: 5 d after the first iron administration; D10: 10 d after the first iron administration; D15: 15 d after the first iron administration; and D30: 15 d after the end of iron administration.There were no statistical differences in any of the comparisons (AMOVA — all P-values ..0.05).2000;64:0–00 The Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research 103disease in horses (40).Nevertheless, a higher alpha diversity was also reported in mice (19) and in piglets after iron supplementation (22).Neither of the other 2 alpha diversity indices tested showed a signifi- cant difference, which agrees with previous studies in other animal species (20,31,32).
No differences in beta diversity were detected in this study, which indicates that iron supplementation did not impact micro - bial composition or the proportion of most bacteria. Interestingly, some studies reported no effect on the intestinal microbiome of mice after iron supplementation (20), whereas others demonstrated significant changes (19,32).It is, therefore likely that other factors such as microbiota composition can modulate the action of iron in the intestinal lumen.It is worth noting that some studies that reported significant changes in the microbiota in mice or piglets used intestinal contents rather than feces, as were used in this study (19,22,28).Although the fecal microbiota has been used as a proxy for other intestinal compartments in horses (24), it is possible that iron supplementation is associated with undetectable changes in microbiota in the small intestines.
In fact, necrotic lesions in the lamina propria of the small intestine have been described in foals that developed acute hepatic failure following parenteral iron administration (16). A significant difference in microbiota composition was seen between Days 5 and 10 in both groups, which highlights the impor - tance of having control animals in such studies.Since all horses were kept in the same housing, fed the same diet, and were sampled during the same period, some changes in microbiota could not be attributed to the iron supplementation.The reason for this could not be determined.Important limitations of this study include the small sample size, the iron content in the diet of the control group being above the recommended daily requirements, and the unexpected variation over time in the microbiota of all the horses studied.
Nevertheless, this study contributes to current knowledge in the equine gastroen- terology literature and provides some information on the effects of short -term iron supplementation on the fecal microbiome. In conclusion, iron supplementation in horses in this study resulted in minor changes in low -abundant bacteria and increased alpha diversity after 15 d of supplementation.Future studies should focus on different doses of supplementation and a longer assessment period to better elucidate the effects of iron supplementation.References 1.Rusu IG, Suharoschi R, Vodnar DC, et al.Iron supplementation influence on the gut microbiota and probiotic intake effect in iron deficiency — A literature -based review.Nutrients 2020;12: 1–17.2.Dunn LL, Rahmanto YS, Richardson DR.Iron uptake and metab- olism in the new millennium.Trends Cell Biol 2007;17:93–100.3.Hyyppä S, Höyhtyä M, Nevalainen M, Pösö AR.
