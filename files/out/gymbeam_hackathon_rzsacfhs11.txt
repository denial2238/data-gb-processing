coriandriodora rhizome by GC-MS and UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-M S and evaluated its antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-enzymatic properties. According to the GC-FID/MS data, its rhizome essential oil (EO) consisted mainly of ( E)-2-decenal (53.8%), ( E)-2- decenyl acetate (24.4%), ( Z)-3-dodecenyl acetate (3.5%), and ( E)-2-octenal (3.5%).Its water extract (WE) and 70% ethanol extract (EE) showed high total phenolic content (TPC, 52.99 –60.49 mg GAEs/g extract) and total ﬂavonoid content (TFC, 260.69 –286.42 mg REs/g extract).In addition, the phytochemicals of WE and EE were further characterized using UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS, and a total of sixty-three compounds were identi ﬁed, including fourteen phenolic components and twenty- three ﬂavonoid compounds.In the antioxidant assay, WE and EE revealed a potent scavenging effect on DPPH (IC 50: 6.59 ± 0.88 mg/mL and 17.70 ± 1.15 mg/mL, respectively), surpassing the BHT (IC 50: 21.83 ± 0.89 mg/mL).
For the antimicrobial activities, EO displayed excellent antibacterial capabilities against Proteus vulgaris , Enterococcus faecalis ,Bacillus subtilis ,Escherichia coli , and Staphylococcus aureus with DIZ (12.60 –22.17 mm), MIC (0.78 –1.56 mg/mL), and MBC (3.13 mg/ mL) and signi ﬁcantly inhibited Aspergillus ﬂavus growth (MIC = 0.313 mg/mL, MFC = 0.625 mg/mL, respectively). In addition to weak tyrosinase andcholinesterase inhibition, EE and WE had a prominent inhibitory effect against a- glucosidase (IC 50: 0.013 ± 0.001 mg/mL and 0.017 ± 0.002 mg/mL), which was signiﬁcantly higher than acarbose (IC 50: 0.22 ± 0.01 mg/mL).Hence, the rhizome ofA.coriandriodora has excellent potential for utilization in the pharmaceutical and food ﬁelds as a source of bioactive substances.

Numerous bioactivities of the Alpinia plant ’s essential oils and extract have been reported, including anti-in ﬂammatory, antimicrobial, insecticidal, n europrotective, antioxidant, antifungal, and analgesic activities ( Ghosh and Rangan, 2013 ;Van et al., 2021 ). Alpinia coriandriodora D.Fang., also known as sweet ginger, is a perennial plant with a distinctive coriander fragrance that is extensively cultivated in China due to its medicinal and edible value (Wu and Larsen, 2000 ;Cheng et al., 2021 ).A.coriandriodora rhizome is used as traditional Chinese medicine for treating fever, asthma, cold, stomachache, and indigestion ( CHMC-Chinese Herbal Medicine Company, 1994 ;Zhang and Li, 2015 ;Wu et al., 2016 ).Moreover, its rhizome was utilized as spices in the preparation of soups and stews.Interestingly, wrapping zongzi with its leaves is a specialty of residents in Guangxi, China.In previous studies on A.
coriandriodora rhizome, several diarylheptanoids and ﬂavonoids were isolated, and these compounds had intracellular antioxidant and anti-in ﬂammatory actions by inhibiting NO release ( Cheng et al., 2021 ).A. coriandriodora is rich in essential oil, and its EO has been used in traditional medicine ( Tran et al., 2022 ).Previous research indicated thatA.coriandriodora rhizome EO was mainly composed of ( E)-2- decenal (60.4 –56.3%) and ( E)-2-decenyl acetate (19.6 –4.3%) and possessed potent anticancer and anti- malassezia effects ( Hong et al., 2022 ;Tran et al., 2022 ).Despite its high edible and medicinal value, there are few reports on the phytochemistry and biological activities of A.coriandriodora rhizome, which may hinder its utilization.Thus, this study analyzed the phytochemical constitution of A.coriandriodora rhizome using GC-FID/MS and UHPLC-Q- Orbitrap-MS and evaluated its an tioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-enzymatic properties.
2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemical and reagents Streptomycin, Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, resazurin, galanthamine, kojic acid, acarbose, rutin, and gallic acid were from Solarbio Life Sciences (Beijing, China). Sigma-Aldrich (Germany) provided BTCl (butyrylthiocholine chloride), ATCI (acetylthiocholine iodide), L-tyrosine, p-NPG ( p-nitrophenyl- a- D-glucopyranoside), BChE (butyrylcholinesterase), AChE (acetylcholinesterase), tyrosinase, a-glucosidase, ABTS (2,2-azino- bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid), DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), and ascorbic acid.Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) supplied a standard n-alkane (C7–C30) in the GC-MS test and formic acid and acetonitrile (LC/ MS-grade) in the UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS test.Aladdin (Shanghai, China) offered other solvents and chemicals in analytical purity.2.2 Plant material Alpinia coriandriodora D.
Fang was cultivated at Guigang City, Guangxi Province, China (latitude: 23°80 ′89.74 ′′N and longitude: 110°18 ′64.68 ″E). The plant samples were harvested in August 2020 and authenticated by Professor Guoxiong Hu, a plant taxonomist.A voucher specimen has been deposited at the Herbarium of the College of Life Sciences, Guizhou University, China (Voucher No: AC2020803).2.3 Extraction of EO, WE, and EE Hydro-distillation was employed to prepare the EO of A.coriandriodora rhizome.In brief, the fresh rhizome (2 kg) was washed using distilled water, crushed, and hydrodistilled (4 h) in a Clevenger ’s apparatus.After drying with anhydrous Na 2SO4,E O was stored at 4°C until further use.Reﬂux extraction was used to produce the WE and EE of the A.coriandriodora rhizome.The crushed plant material (0.5 kg) and 70% ethanol or distilled water (2 L) were added to a round- bottomed ﬂask (5 L).Afterward, the mixture was re ﬂux-extracted twice (2 h/re ﬂux).
The extraction solution was mixed, ﬁltered, condensed using a rotary evaporator, and dried using a freeze drier. Then, WE and EE were weighed and stored in a brown glass bottle at 4°C until usage.2.4 EO ’s composition analysis using GC-FID/MS Quantitative analysis of phytochemical components was performed on GC-FID (Agilent Technologies, 6890N) equipped with an HP-5MS column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 mm ﬁlm thickness).The helium was used as a carrier gas (1 mL/min).The injection volumes were 1 µL (split ratio 1:20).The injector temperature was 250°C.The oven temperature was programmed as follows: kept at 70°C (2 min), raised to 180°C (2°C/min), increased to 310°C (10°C/min), and held at 310°C for 14 min (running time: 84 min).Agilent 6890/5975C GC-MS was employed for qualitative analysis, and its GC settings were the same as those of GC-FID.
The following conditions were applied in MS: ion source (EI, 70 eV); ion source temperature (230°C); interface temperature (280°C); scan range from 29 to 500 m/z. The peak area revealed the relative percentage of different chemical constituents.A series of n-alkanes (C 8–C16) were used to determine the retention index (RI).Matching the RI and MS information in Wiley 275 and NIST 2020 databases was done to identify the chemical constituents.Wu et al.10.3389/fpls.2023.1284931 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 02 2.5 Determination of total phenolic and ﬂavonoid contents 2.5.1 TPC analysis The TPC in WE and EE were quanti ﬁed using the Folin- Ciocalteu method ( Tian et al., 2020 ).Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (2.5 mL) and sample solution (0.5 mL) were combined and kept at 25°C for 5 min.The 7.5% Na 2CO 3solution (4 mL) was subsequently incorporated and reacted for 1 h at 25°C.
The absorbance at 760 nm was measured, and gallic acid equivalents (mg GAEs/g extract) were used to express TPC. 2.5.2 TFC analysis The TFC in WE and EE were quanti ﬁed using NaNO 2-Al(NO 3) 3-NaOH colorimetry with minor modi ﬁcations ( China Pharmacopoeia Committee, 2020 ).The sample solution (5 mL) and NaNO 2(0.4 mL, 5%) were blended and kept at 25°C for 5 min, which was reacted with 10% Al(NO 3)3solution (0.4 mL) for 5 min.Subsequently, 4 mL NaOH solution (4%) and distilled water were added to gain a ﬁnal volume of 10 mL and reacted 15 min at 25°C.The absorbance at 510 nm was measured, and rutin equivalents (mg REs/g extract) were applied to represent TFC.2.6 Identi ﬁcation of phytochemicals in WE and EE by UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS (ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer) was employed for the phytochemical analysis of WE and EE.
Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system settings were as follows: Hypersil Gold C 18column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.9 mm), injection volume (5 mL), column temperature (40°C), ﬂow rate (0.3 mL/min), and mobile phases (A: 0.1% formic acid water solution and B: 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile). The gradient elution protocol was as follows: 5% B (0 –2 min), 5 – 95% B (2 –42 min), 95% B (42 –47 min), 5% B (47.1 min), and 5% B (47.1 –50 min).The MS data collection was performed using Q-Orbitrap-MS (Q Exactive Focus hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc) with HESI-II (heated electrospray ionization).The HESI-II settings were as follows: spray voltages –2.5/+ 3.0 kV, sheath gas 35 arb, auxiliary gas 10 arb, sweep gas 0 arb, RF lens amplitude 60, vaporizer temperature 350°C, and capillary temperature 320°C.
The mode of full mass/ddMS2 mode was used, and its parameters were as follows: full scan range ( m/z100 to 1,500); resolution MS1 (70,000) and MS2 (17,500); maximum injection time 100 ms (MS1) and 50 ms (MS2); stepped normalized collision energy (20/40/60 eV);automatic gain control (AGC) target values 1e 6(MS1) and 2e5 (MS2). Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc’s Xcalibur 4.1 was used to process the mass spectrum data of the chemical composition.The identi ﬁcation of phytochemical constituents was determined by comparing mzVault and mzClo ud databases and references within a 10 ppm threshold.2.7 Antioxidant properties The radical scavenging capacities on DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6- sulphonic acid) were assessed according to the method described in the literature ( Tian et al., 2020 ).Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as a positive control.
2.7.1 DPPH assay Equal amounts of DPPH solution (0.08 mM) and sample solution (100 mL) were mixed, and the reaction was carried out at 25°C for 30 min away from light. Optical density at 517 nm was measured, and IC 50values and BHT equivalents (mg BEs/g sample) were calculated for demonstrating the scavenging effect of DPPH.2.7.2 ABTS assay In order to produce the ABTS +solution, 50 mL of ABTS solution (0.7 mM) was reacted with an equal amount of K 2S2O8 solution (2.45 mM) for 12 h at 25°C without light.In addition, it wasfurther diluted with ethanol prior to use to yield an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.02 at 734 nm.Then, 0.4 mL of sample solution reacted with 4 mL of diluted ABTS  +solution for 10 min at 25°C away from light.Optical density at 734 nm was gained, and IC 50values and the equivalents of BHT (mg BEs/g sample) were expressed in the results.
2.8 Antimicrobial properties 2.8.1 Bacterial strains The antibacterial properties of EO, WE, and EE was assessed against Gram-negative bacterias ( Escherichia coli CICC 10389, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, and Proteus vulgaris ACCC 11002) and Gram-positive bacterias ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538P). 2.8.2 Agar well diffusion assay The agar well diffusion method assayed the diameter of the inhibition zone (DIZ) ( Zhang et al., 2017 ).EO was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with sterile distilled water (DMSO content was less than 0.5%).Sterile distilled water was used to dissolve the WE and EE.Three sample solutions were brought to a concentration of 100 mg/mL.Streptomycin was dissolved in distilled water to reach a 100mg/mL concentration, which was used as a positive control.
The Mueller-Hinton agar medium surface was spread with 100 mL of the bacterial suspension (1 × 107CFU/mL) and was covered with ﬁlter paper discs of 6 mm diameter (containing 20 mL sample solutions). The DIZ was determined after 24 h of incubation at 37°C.2.8.3 Determination of MIC and MBC In a 96-well plate, 100 mL of bacterial suspensions (1 × 106CFU/ mL) was added to an equal amount of sample solution.After 24 h of incubation at 37°C, each well was supplied with 20 mL of resazurin aqueous solution (100 mg/mL), which was cultured for 2 h at 37°C without light.The minimal sample concentration without colorWu et al.10.3389/fpls.2023.1284931 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 03 change was determined as MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) (Tian et al., 2020 ).
The mixture (10 mL) from the wells that did not change color was subcultured in a Mueller Hinton agar plate for 24 h at 37°C, the least sample concentration at which no bacterial growth was determined as MBC (minimal bactericidal concentration) ( Eloff, 1998 ). 2.8.4 Antifungal capacity The anti- Aspergillus ﬂavus activity of EO was tested by a previously published method with slight modi ﬁcation ( da Silva et al., 2012 ) using amphotericin B as a positive control.The EO solution (3.125 mg/mL –100 mg/mL) was mixed with Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium (2:18, v:v).Subsequently, the mixture (15 mL) was added to Petri dishes (diameter 90 mm) and solidi ﬁed.The A.ﬂavus spore suspension (1 × 103CFU/mL, 100mL) was inoculated into wells (6 mm in diameter) of the culture medium and incubated at 28°C for 36 h.
The MIC value was recorded as EO concentrations that inhibited the visible growth of A.ﬂavus, and the diameter of colony growth zone was less than 12 mm (including well diameter of 6 mm) ( Yadav et al., 2005 ). The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was the minimum sample concentration showing no A.ﬂavus growth on the PDA medium.2.9 Enzyme inhibitory properties The enzyme inhibitory properties of A.coriandriodora rhizome WE, EE, and EO on cholinesterases (AChE and BChE), tyrosinase, and a-glucosidase were tested, and gala nthamine, arbutin, and acarbose were used as positive controls, respectively ( Tian et al., 2020 ).2.9.1 Cholinesterases inhibition In a 96-well plate, 10 mL of AChE or BuChE solution (pH 8.0, 0.5 U/mL) and 50 mL of sample solution were mixed and incubated for 5 min at 4°C.
Subsequently, each well was injected with 20 mLo f ATCI (acetylthiocholine iodide) or BTCl (butyrylthiocholine chloride) solution (2 mM) and 20 mL of color-developing agent 5,5’-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) solution (2 mM). After 30 min of reaction at 37°C, the absorbance at 405 nm was read.The galanthamine equivalents (mg GALAEs/g sample) and IC 50values expressed cholinesterase inhibition.2.9.2 Tyrosinase inhibition In a 96-well plate, 100 mL of tyrosinase solution (100 U/mL) was mixed with 70 mL of sample solution and incubated for 5 min at 37° C.Then, 80 mL of L-tyrosine solution (5.5 mM) was injected into each well.After 30 min of reaction at 37°C, the absorbance at 492 nm was measured.Data were presented as arbutin equivalents (mg AREs/g sample) and IC 50values.2.9.3 a-Glucosidase inhibition In a 96-well plate, 10 mLo fa-glucosidase solution was reacted with 90 mL sample solution for 15 min at 37°C.
Next, 10 mLo fp-NPG (p-Nitrophenyl- a-D-glucopyranoside) solution (1 mM) was injectedinto each well and maintained at 37°C or 15 min. Lastly, 80 mLo f Na2CO 3(0.2 M) was added for stopping the reaction.After the absorbance detection at 405 nm, a-glucosidase inhibition was represented as acarbose equivalents (mmoL ACEs/g sample) and IC50values.2.10 Statistical analysis All data were collected from three independently performed experiments and were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).In SPSS (version 25) software, the two-tailed unpaired t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fischer ’s LSD post hoctest ( p< 0.05) were utilized to compare the signi ﬁcant difference between the two groups.3 Results and discussion 3.1 Chemical composition of EO Based on the fresh weight of A.coriandriodora rhizome, the extraction rate of EO was 0.56% (w/w).As shown in Table 1 , a total of 27 chemical compositions, representing 97.0% of the total EO, were identi ﬁed by GC-MS/FID.
As shown in Figure 1 , it was mainly composed of ( E)-2-decenal (53.8%), ( E)-2-decenyl acetate (24.4%), (Z)-3-dodecenyl acetate (3.5%), and ( E)-2-octenal (3.5%). According to our previous study, EO ’s main compounds from A.coriandriodora rhizome harvested at the same location (Guangxi, China) in July 2019 were ( E)-2-decenal (56.3%), ( E)-2-decenyl acetate (19.6%), ( Z)-3-dodecenyl acetate (3.8%), and ( E)-2-octenal (3.6%) ( Hong et al., 2022 ).The main chemical components of A.coriandriodora essential oils from July and August are the same, and the difference in their content may be caused by differentharvesting times.3.2 Chemical composition of WE and EE Based on the fresh weight of A.coriandriodora rhizome, the yield of WE and EE were 2.04% (w/w) and 1.37% (w/w), respectively.As shown in Figure 2 ,A.coriandriodora rhizome WE (60.49 ± 0.24 mg GAEs/g extract) exhibited more TPC compared to EE (52.99 ± 0.16 mg GAEs/g extract) ( p< 0.01).
The TFC in WE (286.42 ± 2.21 mg REs/g extract) was notably greater than that in EE (260.69 ± 0.44 mg REs/g extract) ( p< 0.01). The phytochemical components of WE and EE were further analyzed using UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap- MS.Sixty-three chemicals were identi ﬁed based on comparisons of primary and secondary mass spectrometry with the mzVault and mzCloud databases and references ( Table 2 ).As illustrated in Figure S1 (Supplementary Material ), WE and EE displayed variations in phytochemical constituents.Thirty-seven and ﬁfty-three components were identi ﬁed from WE and EE, respectively.WE and EE had high TPC and TFC values, and fourteen identi ﬁed phenolic compounds and twenty-three ﬂavonoid compounds were identi ﬁed.The fourteen identi ﬁed phenolicWu et al.
10.3389/fpls.2023.1284931 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 04 compounds included hordenine (5), protocatechuic acid (8), 3,4- dihydroxyphenylethanol (9), meth yl gallate (10), vanillic acid (11), protocatechualdehyde (12), 4-methoxy salicylic acid (13), orsellinic acid (15), 2-hydroxy-4-metho xybenzalde hyde (19), p-coumaric acid (21), ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (33), ferulaldehyde (34), tetrahydrocurcumin (36), and arctigenin (39). The twenty-three identi ﬁedﬂavonoid compounds consisted of epicatechin (14), procyanidin B1 (16), astilbin (17), cianidanol (18), (+)-catechin hydrate (20), procyanidin A2 (23), hyperoside (24), quercetin (26), isoquercitrin (27), quercetin 3- O-b-D-Glucuronide (29), tetrahydroxyxanthone (31), mor in (35), pectolinarigenin (40), lysionotin (41), isorhamnetin (43 ), isoxanthohumol (44), gardenin B(46), hydroxygenkwanin (47), 6-demethoxytangeretin (48), jaceosidin (49), eupatilin (50), 4 ’,7-di- O-methylnaringenin (53), and acacetin (57).
All sixty-three constituents were ﬁrst identi ﬁed from A. coriandriodora .These ﬁndings suggested that A.coriandriodora rhizome can serve as a rich source of ﬂavonoids and phenolic compounds.3.3 Antioxidant capacity In the antioxidant capacity of A.coriandriodora rhizome ( Table 3 ), the scavenging effect of EO on DPPH and ABTS was weak.WE (IC 50: 6.59 ± 0.88 mg/mL) and EE (IC 50:1 7 .7 0±1 .1 5 mg/mL) possessedTABLE 1 Chemical components of the EO from A.coriandriodora rhizome.

Based on the results of UHPLC-Q- Orbitrap-MS, a variety of identi ﬁed phenolic and ﬂavonoid compounds, such as protocatechuic acid (8), methyl gallate (10), vanillic acid (11), and epicatechin (14), has been proved to have DPPH and ABTS scavenging effects ( Kakkar and Bais, 2014 ;Li et al., 2014;Bernal-Mercado et al., 2018 ;Ryu and Kim, 2022 ). Hence, the antioxidant activity of A.coriandriodora rhizome WE and EE can be attributed to their richness in phenolics and ﬂavonoids, which can serve as a natural source of antioxidants.3.4 Antibacterial properties The antibacterial properties of EO, WE, and EE were determined qualitatively using the DIZ and assessed quantitatively using the MIC and MBC.Streptomycin was used as the control drug ( Table 4 ).The DIZ of WE and EE (100 mg/mL) were not observed, and the MIC and MBC of WE and EE were not listed as they were not detected at 25 mg/mL.EO exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity with DIZ values ranging from 12.60 to 22.17 mm.
Previous studies suggest that MIC values less than 5 mg/mL have potent antibacterial properties ( Monteiro et al., 2021). Hence, the EO displayed a strong antibacterial effect against P.vulgaris ( M I C=1 .5 6m g / m L ,M B C=3 .1 3m g / m L ) , E.faecalis (MIC = 0.78 mg/mL, MBC = 3.13 mg/mL), B.subtilis (MIC = 0.78 mg/mL, MBC =3 .1 3m g / m L ) , E.coli ( M I C=0 .7 8m g / m L ,M B C=6 .2 5m g / m L )a n d S.aureus (MIC = 0.78 mg/mL, MBC = 3.13 mg/mL).In addition, it revealed moderate antibacterial activity against P.aeruginosa (MIC = 6.25 mg/mL, MBC = 6.25 mg/mL).( E)-2-Decenal, as the predominant component, has been proven to posse ss broad-spectrum antibacterial action, with MIC values ranging from 7.8 to 500 mg/mL against E.coli ,S.aureus ,S.epidermidis ,Salmonella typhi ,S.enteritidis ,Bacillus cereus , Moraxella catarrhalis ,Haemophilus in ﬂuenzae ,Listeria monocytogenes , Streptococcus pneumoniae ,a n d S.pyogenes (Bisignano et al., 2001 ; Trombetta et al., 2002 ).
(E)-2-Octenal was a potential antibacterial a g e n tt h a ti n h i b i t e dt h eg r o w t ho fav a r i e t yo fb a c t e r i a ,i n c l u d i n g S. aureus ,E.coli, P.vulgaris ,P.aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes , Propionibacterium acnes ,Streptococcus mutans ,Brevibacterium ammoniagenes ,a n d Bacillus subtilis (Kubo and Kubo, 1995 ;Sagun et al., 2016 ).Thus, the antibacterial action of A.coriandriodora EO can be attributed to these main components.Bacterial infections and the emergence of bacterial resistance ha ve threatened human public health around the world ( Fernandes et al., 2022 ).Therefore, EO with antibacterial properties has gained great attention.Our results suggested that A.coriandriodora EO may be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries as a natural antibacterial agent.3.5 Antifungal capacity The anti- Aspergillus ﬂavus properties of A.coriandriodora rhizome EO are shown in Figure 3 andTable 5 .

coriandriodora rhizome EO has the exploitation potential as an anti- Aspergillus ﬂavus agent in the food ﬁeld. 3.6 Enzyme inhibitory properties The enzyme inhibitory properties of A.coriandriodora rhizome WE, EE, and EO on cholinesterases (AChE and BChE), tyrosinase, anda-glucosidase were tested, and the results are shown in Table 6 .AD (Alzheimer ’s disease) is a chronic disease with memory loss and cognitive impairment caused by cen tral nervous system degeneration, and low levels of cholinergic energy in the human brain play an essential role in the pathogenesis of AD ( Sharma, 2019 ).As shown in Table 6 , compared with the positive control galanthamine, EO, WE, and EE of A.coriandriodora rhizome showed weak AChE (IC 50:5 .8 4± 0.48 mg/mL, 6.67 ± 0.04 mg/mL, and 1.59 ± 0.09 mg/mL, respectively) and BChE (IC 50: 5.73 ± 0.33 mg/mL, 3.61 ± 0.89 mg/mL, and 0.38 ± 0.02 mg/mL, respectively) inhibitory activity.
In mammals, tyrosinase is a crucial enzyme in the production of melanin, which protects against UV damage, but excessive melanin can lead to many skin problems, such as malignant melanoma, freckles, and age spots ( Brenner and Hearing, 2008 ;Sun et al., 2017 ). Tyrosinase inhibitors have been extensively a pplied in cosmetic and medicineindustries to solve these problems.According to the results presented in Table 6 ,E O( I C 50: 1.01 ± 0.08 mg/mL, 253.12 ± 9.13 mg AREs/g sample) had the most strong tyrosinase inhibition, followed by WE (IC50: 8.91 ± 1.69 mg/mL, 29.78 ± 5.61 mg AREs/g sample) and EE (IC50: 19.85 ± 3.74 mg/mL, 13.21 ± 2.71 mg AREs/g sample).( E)-2- octenal, as the main components of A.coriandriodora rhizome EO, have been demonstrated to poss ess tyrosinase inhibition ( Kubo and Kinst-Hori, 1999 ).Plant-derived ﬂavonoids and phenolic compounds can serve as natural inhibitors of tyrosinase ( Goncc ̧alves and Romano, 2017).
A variety of phenolic and ﬂavonoid compounds identi ﬁed from WE and EE, such as orsellinic acid, a rctigenin, and hordenine, have been con ﬁrmed to possess tyrosinas e inhibitory activity ( Kim et al., 2013;Park et al., 2013 ;Lopes et al., 2018 ). Thus, the tyrosinase inhibition of A.coriandriodora rhizome can be attributed to the presence of these active ingredients.Thea-glucosidase inhibitors can decrease the intake of postprandial carbohydrates by reducing the digestion of carbohydrates and are an effective means of treating type II diabetes ( Gao et al., 2022 ).Nevertheless, synthetic a-glucosidase inhibitors, such as voglibose, emiglitate, miglitol, and acarbose, have unacceptable consequences, including ﬂa t u l e n c e ,n a u s e a ,v o m i t i n g ,d i a r r h e a ,s t o m a c hp a i n ,a n d allergic reactions ( Liu et al., 2015 ;Hossain et al., 2020 ).Hence, there is an urgent need to ﬁnd more effective and safer natural products as a- glucosidase inhibitors.
As illustrated in Table 6 , the inhibitory effects of A. coriandriodora rhizome on a-glucosidase were as follows: EE (IC 50: 0.013 ±0 .0 0 1m g / m L )>W E( I C 50: 0.017 ± 0.002 mg/mL) > acarbose (IC 50: 0.22 ± 0.01 mg/mL) > EO (IC 50:3 .3 0±0 .1 7m g / m L )( p<0 .0 5 ) .N o t a b l y , thea-glucosidase inhibitory capacity of WE (19.92 ± 1.19 mmoL ACEs/g sample) and EE (25.87 ± 2.32 mmoL ACEs/g sample) was signi ﬁcantly higher than acarbose ( p<0 .0 5 ) .Previous studies have indicated that phenolic compounds and ﬂavonoids can act as potent a-glucosidase inhibitors ( Goncc ̧alves and Romano, 2017 ).Various phenolic and ﬂavonoid compounds identi ﬁed from A.coriandriodora rhizome, such as hordenine ( Su et al., 2018 ),p- TABLE 6 The enzyme inhibitory properties of A.coriandriodora rhizome EO, WE, and EE.

Furthermore, epicatechin ( Lin et al., 2022) and pectolinarigenin ( Amin et al., 2017 )s h o w e ds t r o n g e r inhibitory ef ﬁcacy against a-glucosidase compared to acarbose.T h e s ep h e n o l i ca n d ﬂavonoid compounds may contribute to the potent a-glucosidase inhibition of A.coriandriodora rhizome WE and EE.Hence, A.coriandriodora rhizome WE and EE could be utilized as a novel source of a-glucosidase inhibitors for the functional food and pharmaceutical industries.4 Conclusions In addition to the chemical composition of A.
coriandriodora rhizome EO, this study is the ﬁrst to analyze the phytochemical components of WE and EE and evaluate their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and enzyme inhibitory properties. According to the GC-MS data, the primary components of A.coriandriodora rhizome EO were ( E)-2-decenal, ( E)-2-decenyl acetate, ( Z)-3-dodecenyl acetate, and ( E)-2-octenal.A.coriandriodora rhizome WE and EE were abundant in phenolics and ﬂavonoids.UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS analysis further identi ﬁed sixty-three compounds in WE and EE, including 14 phenolic compounds and 23 ﬂavonoids.WE and EE exhibited a potent DPPH radical scavenging effect, superior to the positive control BHT.Besides, EO displayed powerful antimicrobial activity against E.faecalis ,S.aureus ,B.subtilis ,E.coli ,P.vulgaris ,a n d A.ﬂavus.In enzyme inhibitory activity, the EE and WE revealed a remarkable a-glucosidase inhibition, which were higher than positive control acarbose.Hence, A.
coriandriodora rhizome may be used as a source of bioactive substances and has excellent potential for exploitation in the pharmaceutical and food ﬁelds.
