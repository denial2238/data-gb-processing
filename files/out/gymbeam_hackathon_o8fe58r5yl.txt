RESEARCH ARTICLE Development of freshness indicator for monitoring chicken breast quality and freshness during storage Yong-Yeon Kim1•Sung-Jin Park1•Jun-Seo Kim1•Han-Seung Shin1 Received: 12 December 2021 / Revised: 7 January 2022 / Accepted: 12 January 2022 / Published online: 8 February 2022 /C211The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2022 Abstract An indicator for freshness and quality measure- ment was utilized to perceive changes in freshness quality while storing chicken breasts.Visible color changes of theindicator shows spoilage and freshness of the packaged products.In addition, changes in pH, volatile basic nitrogen (VBN) ,andPseudomonas spp.were monitored.The color change sensor ( DE) reﬂected the headspace pH during the chicken breasts’ packaging process.After storing chicken breast at 20 /C176C for 24 h, the color change ( DE) of the indicator for freshness and quality measurement changed.
The color change ( DE) values were correlated with quality characteristics such as sensory, microbiological, andchemical properties that were popularly used to settle the freshness of chicken breast. In conclusion, the results showed that the indicator for freshness and quality mea-surement was useful in settling the shelf life of chicken breast products by physicochemical changes and monitor- ing microbial safety.Keywords Volatile basic nitrogen (VBN) /C1Food quality /C1 Indicator for freshness and quality measurement /C1 Packaging /C1Chicken breastIntroduction In recent years, consumer demand has shifted toward fresh or chilled meat in preference to frozen meat (Shin et al., 2006 ).Chilled storage has been applied to fulﬁll this need and proven successful, as evidenced by its universal use topreserve meat and its comprehensive scientiﬁc validation.However, product temperature remained a critical factor for food safety.
Even small temperature differences canimpact meat organoleptic traits and microbial loading, lipid and fatty acid proﬁle, and protein degradation and oxida- tion characteristics (Vaikousi et al., 2009 ). Consumer satisfaction and intention to repurchase were dependent on meat sensory properties, and vary depending on the its storage duration and conditions.Chicken spoiledquickly within a week of slaughter, regardless of storage conditions (Kim et al., 2017 ).The food industry has con- tinuously developing new technologies to meet consumers’expectancy for foods to improve safety and sensory quality (Vaikousi et al., 2009 ).However, other than expiration date, scientiﬁc methods and objective to announce the consumers about the fresh- ness of the chicken have yet to be commercialized (Lee andShin, 2019 ; Baston, 2008 ).
Sensory, bacteriological, chemical, and physical methods are available to evaluate chicken freshness (Kuswandi and Nurfawaidi, 2017 ) but have disadvantages of time-consuming, lengthy, costly, and less accurate. Therefore, low-cost, efﬁcient, and a simple method of evaluating chicken quality is necessitatedfor grocery store environments, supermarket, particularly in the home, and in-ﬁeld applications.Intelligent packaging allows consumers to inspect the record of changes in the quality change and the distribution environment of the product until the product is utilized (Dainty, 1996 ).
The three main types of intelligent&Han-Seung Shin spartan@dongguk.edu Yong-Yeon Kim kimyy613@naver.com Sung-Jin Park xpzmslr43@naver.com Jun-Seo Kim khkjs95@naver.com 1Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, Dongguk University-Seoul, Ilsandong-gu, Gyeonggi-do 10326,Republic of Korea 123Food Sci Biotechnol (2022) 31(3):377–385 https://doi.org/10.1007/s10068-022-01034-x packaging include time–temperature indicators, indicator for freshness and quality measurement, and radiofrequency identiﬁcation tags (Kuswandi, 2011 ). Intelligent packaging provides users with accurate and reliable information aboutthe state of the integrity, the environment and the food of their combinations or the packaging (Kuswandi and Nur- fawaidi, 2017 ).Packaging technology with indicator sen- sors accrete to monitor food spoilage helps to ensure the safety and the quality of packaged foods (Shukla et al., 2015 ).
Indicator for freshness and quality measurement pro- vides product quality information associated with micro-bial growth and chemical changes in food. Especially, pH- sensitive dyes can be used by developing sensors for detecting volatile basic amines in poultry, meat, and ﬁsh(Biji et al., 2015 ).These sensitive dyes include natural dyes, such as curcumin, methyl red, and bromocresol purple.The color of the indicator pH-sensor changes fromacid to basic form due to volatile amine substances pro- duced when aquatic products and meat products decay (Ezati et al., 2019 ).In order to apply the indicator for freshness and quality measurement, the sensitivity between the metabolite and the indicator is important, and it is essential to prevent the transition of the substance to food(Lee et al., 2017 ).The increase in VBN content during chicken storage process is due to the breakdown of proteins as growth ofmicroorganisms, resulting in ammonia (NH 3) and amino acids.
Decarboxylation of amino acids also produces hydrogen sulﬁde (H 2S), carbon dioxide (CO 2), and volatile amines. The combination of NH 3nitrogen produced through this process and volatile amines, such as trimethylamine (TMA) and dimethylamine (DMA), iscalled volatile basic nitrogen (VBN) (Lee et al., 2017 ).In addition, VBN has been used as an important reference index to monitor chicken freshness, representing a chang-ing tendency among various quality factors and a temper- ature dependence such as the occurrence of unpleasant order (Lee and Shin, 2019 ).Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the correlation between the concentration of volatile amines and the number of microorganisms during storage of chicken breast and then develop a indicator forfreshness and quality measurement for rapid visual inspection of chicken breast spoilage.
Materials and methods Materials From January to November 2021, the chicken breasts approximately 100 g per ﬁllet (7 cm 915 cm) were pur- chased on the day of slaughter from a local market inGoyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. Cellulose acetate (Mw of approximately 30,000 g/mol), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 2-butanone were purchased from Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd.(Tokyo, Japan).Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and BCPsolution were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.(St.Louis, MO, USA).Acetone was purchased from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany).Filter papers were obtainedfrom Whatman /C210GE Healthcare & Life Sciences (Seoul, Korea), and polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) was obtained as a gas-permeable membrane from Hyundai Micro., Ltd.(Seoul, Korea).Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was purchased from Merck & Co.(Kenilworth, NJ, USA).The threeamines in this study were methylamine (MA), DMA, and TMA, which were supplied as hydrochloride salts by TCI (Tokyo, Japan).
Propylamine hydrochloride as an internalstandard was also purchased from TCI. The poly- dimethylsiloxane divinylbenzene (PDMS-DVB, 65 lm) solid-phase microextraction (SPME) ﬁber was purchasedfrom Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA).Standard 20-mL headspace vials with cap and PTFE septa were obtained from JSI Scientiﬁc (Freehold, NJ, USA).Fabrication of indicator for freshness and quality measurement The indicator for freshness and quality measurement sensor was produced by coating with a BCP-polymer matrixsolution.Brieﬂy, 0.6 g of cellulose acetate was thoroughly fused in 20 mL of 1:1 butanone:acetone using an ultrasonic cleaner (model JAC 2010, Kodo Technical Institute Co.,Ltd, Hwaseong, Korea), followed by the addition of 0.62 g DBP (Byrne et al., 2002 ).The optimum dose of BCP was added to the polymer matrix solution.The ﬁlter paper wasimmersed in 10 mL of the BCP-polymer matrix solution through an absorption method.
It was dried at 20 /C176C for 1 h and cut with a cutting machine into squares of approxi-mately 2 cm 92 cm. The indicator for freshness and quality measurement was put between the PET ﬁlm and hydrophobic gas-permeable membrane (PTFE) to protectthe freshness-indicator-coated surface from humidity (Pacquit et al., 2007 ).The indicator for freshness and quality measurement prototype is shown in Fig.1.pH measurement The pH values of chicken breast were measured using a pH meter (Orion Star TMA211 Conductivity Benchtop Meter, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) pre-cali-brated with buffer solutions of known pH (pH 4.01 ±0.01 7.00±0.01, and 10.00 ±0.01) at room temperature (20/C176C) before measurement.Each sample was prepared by adding 10 g of minced chicken breast samples to 20 mL of distilled water and homogenized at 2500 rpm for 30 s.The 123378 Y.-Y.Kim et al.homogenate was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min.
The pH of supernatant was measured at the storage temperature (20/C176C). All determinations were performed in triplicate.Measurement of VBN content VBN was determined by the Conway microdiffusion technique, as described by Kim and Shin ( 2011 ).Brieﬂy, 5 g of chicken breast sample in 25 mL of distilled waterwas homogenized at 2500 rpm for 30 s, then stood for 30 min.The homogenized sample was ﬁltered through Whatman No.1 ﬁlter paper.The ﬁltrate was adjusted to25 mL with distilled water.One milliliter of the diluted sample was dispensed into the outer chamber of the Con- way dish, and 1 mL of 0.01 N H 2SO4was put in the inner chamber.After that, 1 mL of saturated K 2CO 3was quickly put in the outer chamber of the Conway dish.The Conway dish was tightly sealed and carefully shaken so that solu-tions in the outer chamber could mix.The sample was left in the incubator at 25 /C176C for 60 min.
After incubation, 10 lL of Brunswick indicator was added to the inner chamber and titrated with 0.01 N NaOH. The following formula was used to calculate the VBN content: VBN mg =100g ðÞ ¼ 0:14/C2b/C0a ðÞ /C2 f ðÞ =S/C2100/C2d where Sis the weight of the chicken breast sample (g), bis the volume of 0.01 N NaOH (mL), ais the volume (mL) of 0.01 N NaOH added to the sample, dis the dilution factor, andfis the titer of NaOH (Min et al., 2007 ).Microbial growth analysis of chicken breast samplesTen grams of chicken breast sample was transferred to a stomacher bag under the aseptic condition, and 90 mL ofsterile 0.1% peptone water was added.Then, the sample was homogenized in a stomacher (BagMixer /C210400 W, Interscience, France) at room temperature (20 /C176C) for 4 min.The homogenate was serially diluted tenfold with 0.1% sterile peptone water.
Total bacterial count was enumerated colony forming unit (log CFU/g) on Petri-ﬁlm TM(3 MTM, Elyria, OH, USA) inoculated with 1 mL of the diluted solution after incubation at 35 ±1/C176C for 48±2h . Pseudomonas spp.were enumerated colonyforming unit (log CFU/g) on Pseudomonas agar base (code CM 0559, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) with Pseudomonas CFC-selective agar supplement (code SR0103, Oxoid,Basingstoke, UK) after incubation at 30 /C176C for 48 h (Kim et al., 2017 ; Lee and Shin, 2019 ).Chromaticity analysis The chromaticity of the indicator for freshness and quality measurement sensor was measured using a colorimeter (CR-10 Plus, Konica Minolta, Osaka, Japan) during 72 h of storage.To assess the applicability of the developed indi-cator for freshness and quality measuremet to monitor the spoilage process of chicken breast, the sensor was attached to the headspace inside the package of chicken breastsamples.
The sample with indicator for freshness and quality measurement was stored at 20 /C176C in an incubator. The sensor under measurement was placed in white in aclosed box to avoid interference with light from the sur- rounding environment (Kim et al., 2012 ).The Hunter color parameters L(lightness), a(redness), and b(yellowness) were determined in triplicate for each sample.Lranges from 0 to 100, and a(green to red) and b(blue to yellow) range from -120 to 120 (Leon et al., 2006 ).Results were expressed as mean ±standard deviation (SD).The total color difference ( DE) was calculated as follows: E¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ L/C0L 0ðÞ2þa/C0a0ðÞ2þb/C0b0ðÞ2q : Headspace 2solid-phase microextraction (HS- SPME) analysis Chicken breast sample was cut into accurately weighed log-shaped pieces, homogenized, and placed in a 50 mLplastic centrifuge tube.20 mL of 0.5 N HCl was added to each tube, centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min and vor- texed for 5 min.
The supernatant was transferred to a 25-mL volumetric ﬂask, and the volume was completed with distilled water. An aliquot of 0.5 mL was dispensedinto a 20-mL SPME vial, followed by the addition of 0.5 mL of the internal standard (5.0 lg/mL) and 1 mL of 15 M NaOH solution.A magnetic stirrer bar was Coating film Sensor (filter paper with Bromocresol purple) Hydro gas permeable membrane Double-sided tape 2cm 2cm2.8cm 2.8cmFig.1 Prototype sensor for chicken breast indicator forfreshness and quality measurement 123Development of freshness indicator for monitoring chicken breast 379 introduced, the SPME ﬁber needle was inserted for head- space extraction, and the mixture in the vial was stirred at 50/C176C for 15 min.The ﬁber needle and the stirrer were vertically aligned to prevent spillage from the ﬁber.Whenextraction was completed, the ﬁber needle was inserted into the GC injector port for GC-FID analysis.
GC analysis A CP-Volamine (30 m 90.32 mm I.D.) capillary column was installed in an Agilent Technologies 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a ﬂame ionization detector(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The tem- perature of the injector and detector were 200 and 250 /C176C, respectively.The column temperature was programmed at40/C176C, held for 5 min, then ramped to 120 /C176Ca t1 0 /C176C/min and held for 2 min in Supplementary material 1 (Lee and Shin, 2019 ).Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 23 software package program for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).All experiments were per-formed in triplicate.Values were expressed as mean ±s- tandard deviation (SD).One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at p\0.05 was followed by the Student– Newman–Keuls test (Lee and Shin, 2019 ).
The correlation between the sensor response and pH, VBN, Pseudomonas spp., total bacterial count, and DEwas evaluated by Pearson’s correlation method (Ezati et al., 2019 ). Results and discussion Sensor response to chicken breast during storage The indicator for freshness and quality measurement was attached to the top of the chicken breast package with asquare hole to detect the pH increase in the headspace of the package as the volatile amine compounds (e.g., NH 3, DMA, TMA) were progressively released due to thespoilage of chicken breast.It should be noted that the headspace volume of the packaging is the important factor as the indicator changes color by the volatile aminecompounds.Storage temperature was set at 20 /C176C for the accelerated experiment.During storage at 20 /C176C, the indicator for freshness and quality measurement underwent a distinct visual color change from yellow to purple at the endpoint in Fig.2.
Concurrent with these visual observations, sig- niﬁcant changes occurred in the chromaticity values of the indicator for freshness and quality measurement withprogressive storage of chicken breast at 20 /C176C in Table 1. For example, L,a, and bvaried from 87.73 to 52.74, from -0.40 to -0.83, and from 52.27 to -8.03, respec- tively.The DEvalue increased gradually as the initial yellow color of the indicator for freshness and quality measurement changed to green within 24 h of the experi- ment and turned purple at the endpoint.A similar resultreported by Lee et al.( 2017 ) identiﬁed the spoilage of chicken breasts stored at 4 and 10 /C176C for 8 days with a three-layered indicator for freshness and quality measure- ment consisting of PET/bromocresol green -ethylene vinyl acetate -acetic composite layer/porous substrates.
Based on these results, it was conﬁrmed whether the quality change of chicken breast during storage could be detected in real time using the developed indicator forfreshness and quality measurement. pH and VBN of chicken breast samplesPhysicochemical characteristics, including pH and VBN, were monitored to evaluate the freshness of chicken breaststored at 20 /C176C.The pH value of the chicken breast sam- ples increased signiﬁcantly during storage ( p\0.05) in Table 2.At the beginning of storage, the initial pH value of the chicken breast sample was 5.80, but it increased to 6.61 at 72 h.The pH directly affects chicken breast quality, such as its juices, cooking losses, and shelf life (Mir et al.,2017 ).Previous studies have reported that a pH of about 6.2–6.5 indicates the onset of chicken breast deterioration, and as the pH value increases, the generation of VBN,TMA, and other amines accumulate due to microbial activity (Jouki and Khazaei, 2012 ; Lee and Shin, 2019 ).
In the process of chicken breast spoilage, the generated VBNextracts protons from water molecules to release hydroxyl ions (OH -), pH and ammonium ions (NH?) increases. This result is consistent with pH 6.2–6.3 of spoiled meat stip-ulated in previous studies (Mills et al., 2014 ).Chicken breast is rich in free amino acids and proteins (Caminha et al., 2004 ).The free amino acids can be con- verted into gases, such as NH 3,C O 2, and H 2S, due to oxidative deamination, decarboxylation and desulfurization (Jung et al., 2010 ; Melo et al., 2012 ).Proteins in meat can also be transformed into amino acids by microorganisms with proteolysis activity.In addition to the CO 2generated by the decomposition of protein and amino acids, CO 2is produced during microbial respiration, and the increase in the amount of CO 2during chicken breast decay is attrib- uted to the increase in the number of microorganisms(Baston et al., 2008 ; Rukchon et al., 2014 ).
Among the various protein decomposition products due to microbial growth, VBN is often used as a chemicalindex to assess product quality and shelf life (Balamatsia et al., 2007 ). While storing chicken breast at 20 /C176C, the 123380 Y.-Y.Kim et al.VBN analysis to indicate the degree of decomposition of the sample was determined by the Conway microdiffusion method (Kim and Shin, 2011 ).The VBN content of chicken breast samples increased signiﬁcantly during storage ( p\0.05) in Table 2.VBN increased from 6.53 mg/100 g for the fresh chicken to 21.95 mg/100 g at 20/C176C at 24 h.A previous report also showed a progressive increase in VBN levels during storage (Kim et al., 2017 ).According to the Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS), the VBN standard for packaged meat is 20 mg/ 100 g (MFDS, 2015 ).As a result, the threshold level of VBN in chicken breast stored at 20 /C176C occurred within 24 h.
Microbial analysis of chicken breast samples The quality and freshness of chicken mainly depend on the number of microorganisms involved in spoilage (Bala- matsia et al., 2006 ). As mentioned above, poultry meat spoils rapidly within a week.Among the microorganismsinvolved in the degradation of quality, such as the odor generation of chicken, are Pseudomonas spp.and yeast (Russell et al., 1995 ).At the early storage time, certain spoilage microorgan- isms are present in small amounts and constitute only a fraction of the natural microorganisms.However, as stor-age time increases, they usually grow faster than the non- spoilage microorganisms and produce a variety of metabolites that cause off-ﬂavors, off-odors, and texturechanges, eventually leading to sensory rejection (Rukchon et al., 2014 ).The microbial analysis results of Pseudomonas spp.and total bacterial count are displayed in Supplementary material 2.
During the initial 24 h, there was a steady increase in Pseudomonas spp., from 3.65 log CFU/g to 7.08 log CFU/g, and in the total bacterial count, from 3.81 log CFU/g to 7.32 log CFU/g. According to Balamatsia et al.(2007 ) and Senter et al.( 2000 ), fresh chicken breast has a permissible threshold based on the number of microor- ganisms of 7 log CFU/g.In view of the prior research, this study selected the initial spoilage level of Pseudomonas spp.and total bacterial count as 7 log CFC/g.Correlation between the sensor response and pH, VBN, Pseudomonas spp., and total bacterial count during storage of chicken breast samples The correlation coefﬁcients for the color response of the sensor and target indicators (pH, VBN, Pseudomonas spp., and total bacterial count) during storage of chicken breastsamples at 20 /C176C are listed in Table 3.There were strong correlations between the number of Pseudomonas spp.and L(-0.922), a(-0.110), b(-0.932), and DE(0.959).
The next strongest set of correlations was with total bac- terial count ( -0.919, -0.087, -0.921, and 0.953 for L, a,b, and DE, respectively), followed by pH (-0.859, -0.098, -0.081, and 0.910 for L,a,b, andDE, respectively). VBN had the weakest correlation (-0.838, -0.160, -0.853, and 0.875 for L,a,b, andDE, respectively).All data were signiﬁcantly different (p\0.01), except for a, which started at -0.40 at 0 h, increased to 0.76 at 24 h, and then decreased again to - 0.83 at 72 h.The correlation between the color response and quality indicators was good but still insufﬁcient.The endpoint of the indicator should match the endpoint ofproduct quality.Some previous reports (Balamatsia et al., 2006 ; Melo et al., 2012 ) demonstrated that the microbial spoilage of chicken breast begins when microbial levels was 6.0–7.0 log CFU/g, and the level of microbial spoilage occured in chicken breast is 9 log CFU/g.
As mentioned above, themicrobial shelf life of chicken breast samples in our study was determined based on total bacterial count and Pseu- domonas spp. The acceptable value of the product was 7 log CFU/g.Furthermore, the upper limit of the chemical storage life of chicken breast was deﬁned as 20 mg/100 g VBN and pH 6.2.As a result, the quality indicator criteriaidentiﬁed the shelf life of chicken breast at 20 /C176C as less than 24 h because the pH, VBN , Pseudomonas spp., and total bacterial count already exceeded the set limits withinthis time.MA, DMA, and TMA analysisPDMS-DVB ﬁbers were used in the HS-SPME of MA, DMA, and TMA for their analysis by GC-FID.SPME iswidely used in analytical practice because of its advan- tages: short extraction time, simplicity of operation, the possibility of automation, solvent-free operation, and Fig.

Kim et al. straightforward coupling with GC (Spietelun et al., 2010 ).Serena and sin 65 lm PDMS-DVB is as suitable SPME ﬁber to evaluate the amount of VBN (Chan et al., 2007 ).Chromatograms of the MA, DMA, and TMA contents in spiked chicken breast samples are shown in Supplementarymaterial 3.The calibration curve used for quantitative analysis of the three volatile amines (MA, DMA, TMA) was based onﬁve concentration levels (2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, and 40.0 lg/ g).A certain amount of internal standard was added.Each point in the calibration curve was the average of three peakarea measurements.The calibration curve showed with the coefﬁcient of determination (R 2)o fC0.99 in Supple- mentary material 4.The limit of detection (LOD) is the lowest concentration with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 3, while the limit ofquantitation (LOQ) is a concentration with an S/N ratio of 10.The LOD, LOQ, and peak area recovery are shown in Supplementary material 5.
In this study, the LOD was0.17lg/mL for MA. 0.18 lg/mL for DMA, and 0.17 lg/ mL for TMA, and the corresponding LOQ values were 0.52, 0.55, and 0.52 lg/mL, respectively.The standard peak area recovery rate was 88.87% for MA, 101.87% for DMA, and 103% for TMA.The contents of MA, DMA, and TMA in chicken breast samples during storage at 20 /C176C are given in Supplemen- tary material 6.In comparison with other food matrices (Chan et al., 2007 ), MA was detected from 48 h at 2.29 lg/ g and increased to 8.58 lg/g at 72 h, DMA was detected from 48 h at 2.97 lg/g and increased to 17.51 lg/g at 72 h, and TMA was detected from 12 h at 2.12 lg/g and increased to 45.92 lg/g at 72 h.There was a good corre- lation between the TMA concentration and DEduring chicken breast storage in Fig.3.There was a strong correlation between product quality and the sensor color change during storage.
In addition, a indicator for freshness and quality measurement has alsobeen developed that changes color according to the microbiological, organoleptic and chemical shelf life of chicken breast. During storage of chicken breast, thefreshness sensor changed from yellow to green and ﬁnally purple at 24 h, the pH reached 6.27, and the contents ofVBN, Pseudomonas spp., and total bacterial count reached 21.95 mg/100 g, 7.08 log CFU/g, and 7.32 mg/100 g, respectively.There was a strong correlation between thecolor change of the sensor and the chemical quality indi- cator during the storage of chicken breast.Therefore, the freshness of chicken products can be measured using theproposed indicator for freshness and quality measurement.This study is expected to become a standard for fresh meat indicators.Moreover, it could be expected to be applied inthe intelligent packaging of various food groups to monitor the freshness of foods, including chicken breast, in real- time.
However, future research should investigate theresponse to a variety of food and environmental conditions, including high temperatures, dynamic temperature ﬂuctu- ations, and damaged packaging. Finally, pH, VBN, andmicrobiological analysis were performed to determine the change in quality and shelf life of chilled chicken breasts stored at 20 /C176C.The color of the indicator for freshness and quality measurement sensor changed after storage for 24 h.As a result of measuring quality changes during the storageTable 3 Correlation coefﬁcient of multiple correlations between total bacterial count, Pseudomonas spp.,VBN, pH and color of the sensorParameter L a b DE pH -0.859** -0.098 -0.881** 0.910** p= 0.000 p= 0.648 p= 0.000 p= 0.000 VBN (mg/100 g) -0.838** -0.160 -0.853** 0.875** p= 0.000 p= 0.456 p= 0.000 p= 0.000 Pseudomonas spp.

Therefore, the manufactured indicator for freshness and quality measurement can check the freshness and quality of poultry products in circulation. Indicator for freshness and quality measurement can beused in various ways, including consumer conﬁdence, product stability, quality improvement, and expiration date extension.Since chicken breast was stored at 20 /C176C, future research should be conducted under actual distribution and storage condition for ﬁeld application.Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1007/s10068- 022-01034-x .Acknowledgements This study was supported by the Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (IPET) through the High Value-added Food Technology Development Program funded by the Ministry of Agri-culture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) (121017-03).
