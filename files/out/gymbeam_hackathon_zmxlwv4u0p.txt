Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate skin carotenoid scores measured using the Veggie Meter as a rapid, noninvasive screening tool for VAD in Nepali children and pregnant women.Methods: This comparative cross-sectional study enrolled 164 pregnant women and 168 children (aged 8 to 12 y) from public hospitals in three distinct outlying ecological regions of Nepal (Terai, Hill, and Mountain). The primary outcome assessed whether skin carotenoid status could be a biomarker for VAD.We determined skin carotenoid scores using the Veggie Meter and compared them with serum retinol and total carotenoid concentrations assessed by HPLC.Correlation analysis was used to determine bivariate associations between serum retinoland total carotenoid concentrations, and the Veggie Meter assessed skin carotenoid status.Receiver operating characteristics curves were determined, and a Pvalue<0.05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant.
Results: We found that 8.5% of pregnant women and 13.0% of children in this study had severe VAD (serum retinol <200 ng/mL). There were signi ﬁcant correlations between skin carotenoid scores with serum retinol and total carotenoid concentrations among pregnant women and children ( r¼0.253 –0.530, P/C200.001).The Veggie Meter detected severe VAD with 57.1% sensitivity and 82.7% speci ﬁcity in pregnant women and 61.9% sensitivity and 75.9% speci ﬁcity in children.Conclusions: Although sensitivity and speci ﬁcity were moderate for detecting VAD with the Veggie Meter, skin carotenoid assessment using this rapid, noninvasive portable device could still be valuable for high-risk VAD screening in Nepal and similar developing countries withlimited access to laboratory measurement of serum vitamin A concentrations.
Keywords : skin carotenoids, serum carotenoids, serum retinol, vitamin A, Veggie Meter, Nepal Introduction Vitamin A de ﬁciency (VAD) is a persistent public health problem in developing countries, including Nepal [ 1,2]. In a survey of nutritional status conducted by the WHO between 1995and 2005, 44% –50% of preschool children in South Asian regions had severe VAD [ 3].Vitamin A (retinol) and its pro-vitamin A precursor carotenoids are crucial micronutrients for vision, im-mune function, cell growth, and differentiation, which arecommonly found in the liver, ﬁsh oils, dairy products, leafy green vegetables, and orange/yellow fruits and vegetables [ 4–7].Despite global efforts to enhance local diets with more foods rich in vitamin A and its carotenoid precursors and to improve sup-plement access, studies continue to report high morbidity and mortality rates due to VAD, particularly in children, pregnant women, and women of childbearing age [ 1–3,8,9].
If not diagnosed and treated in a timely manner, VAD may result in vision loss and blindness, especially in children,impacting the quality of life of affected individuals [ 2,8]. Ac- cording to the 1998 Nepal Micronutrient Status Survey ,5 %o f nursing mothers with children aged 6 –59 mo had night blind- ness.The extent of night blindness was more remarkable in ruralareas (18%) relative to urban (6%) and differed across the Abbreviations: DAD, diode array detection; ROC, receiver operating characteristics; VAD, vitamin A de ﬁciency; RU, re ﬂection units.* Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: raba.thapa@tilganga.org (R.Thapa), emmanuel.k.addo@utah.edu (E.K.Addo), sruit@tilganga.org (S.Ruit), paul.bernstein@hsc.utah.edu (P.S.

Published by Elsevier Inc.All rights reserved.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1211 –1219 various ecological regions [ 10].As a result, the Nepal govern- ment launched an intervention program, which signi ﬁcantly decreased VAD incidence and its consequent comorbidities suchas night blindness and mortality among the populace [ 11].However, a recent study in 2016 revealed that VAD persists in most remote areas in Nepal [ 12].The study reported 4% and 3% VAD prevalence in children and women, respectively.
This prevalence is partly due to socioeconomic factors such as illit-eracy, limited accessibility to health care facilities, and ﬁnancial constraints as well as nutritionally poor local diets [ 1,4,9]. Of note, routine screening for VAD is not possible in Nepal, as thereare no laboratory facilities for serum retinol analysis anywhere inthis country of >29 million population.Hence, biochemical tests for VAD are usually sent to overseas laboratories, which areexpensive and often subject to considerable delays.This chal-lenge warrants the development and validation of alternativesimple, rapid, and cost-effective approaches to assess VAD among the populace.Although it is not feasible to measure systemic vitamin A concentrations noninvasively, it is possible to measure total skincarotenoids rapidly and noninvasively by resonance Ramanspectroscopy [ 13–15] or by pressure-mediated re ﬂectometry [16–18].
Previous studies have reported that skin carotenoid scores using either technique correlate well with serum totalcarotenoids (whose predominant carotenoid is typicallypro-vitamin A β-carotene), and such measurements can be used as a biomarker of fruit and vegetable intake [ 19–21]. The Veggie Meter is a commercially available, portable, validated, noninvasive re ﬂectometry device for skin carotenoid measurement that holds potential as a screening tool for identi-fying nutritionally compromised individuals [ 16–18].However, to our knowledge, no study to date has assessed whether its skincarotenoid score could serve as a biomarker for VAD, especiallyin developing countries such as Nepal.Hence, our study soughtto determine whether skin carotenoid status measured with theVeggie Meter could detect severe VAD in children and pregnantwomen from three outlying ecological regions of Nepal.Methodology Clinical study sites This is a hospital-based cross-sectional study.
The study was conducted in collaboration with three public hospitals located inthree ecological regions of Nepal. The study sites were Narayani Hospital, Parsa, Birgunj, Province 2, Nepal (Terai); Trishuli Hospital, Bidur Municipality, Nuwakot district, Province 3,Nepal (Hill); and Rasuwa Hospital, Gosaikunda Rural Munici-pality, Rasuwa district, Province 3, Nepal (Mountain).Inclusion criteria Pregnant women in any trimester of their pregnancy and children (aged 8 to 12 y) were eligible for the study.Exclusion criteria Individuals were excluded from the study if they failed to provide written informed consent, had impairment/disease thataffected study outcome measures, or were known to have blood-borne diseases (that is, diagnosed with human immune de ﬁ- ciency virus or hepatitis infection).Sample size and power calculations The use of the Veggie Meter as a screening tool for VAD has not been conducted previously.
Therefore, based on previous studies, we assumed a prevalence of VAD of 10% to 20% for this study involving three distinct Nepali ecological regions. Allowingfor ~10% sample loss during shipment, handling, and analysis,the desired sample size was 165 pregnant women and 165 chil-dren.Thus, for each of the three participating public hospitals, weenvisioned enrolling 55 pregnant women and 55 children.Ethical approval The Nepal Health Research Council provided ethical approval to conduct the study (Reference no.899/2020).The studyadhered strictly to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, andall participants provided informed written consent before studyenrolment.Parents/guardians consented for children.Informed assent was obtained from the children.
Demographic characteristics We collected participants ’demographic data such as age, gender, occupation, educational level, height and weight for BMIcalculation, dietary history (whether a vegetarian or not andfrequency of vegetables and fruit ingestion), supplement use, andsmoking history. In addition, the medical history, includingdiabetes, hypertension, and any other systemic problems, wasexamined and recorded by the pediatrician and gynecologist inchildren and pregnant women, respectively.Skin carotenoid assessment We used the Veggie Meter produced by the Longevity Link Corporation, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, to assess skin carotenoid status by pressure-mediated re ﬂectometry.The Veggie Meter is a validated, rap id, noninvasive, and portable device that is a biomarker for fruit and vegetable intake, and itsskin carotenoid score has a strong signi ﬁcant positive correla- tion with skin resonance Raman spectroscopy and serum totalcarotenoids [ 16–18,22].
Brie ﬂy, the skin tissue of interest (that is, the index ﬁnger) is illuminated with broad-band white light spanning the spectral range from 350 to 850 nm, and thespectral composition of the diffusively re ﬂected light is analyzed in real-time. Participants gently press their index ﬁn- gers against the convex lens surface with the help of aspring-loaded cover, which momentarily squeezes blood out ofthe illuminated tissue volume, reducing oxyhemoglobin ’sa n d other chromophores ’inﬂuence on the re ﬂection spectra.A laptop computer connected to the Veggie Meter regulates thelight exposure, data acquisition, processing, and display of thereﬂection spectra.The display provides the skin carotenoid score on a scale from 0 to 800.The single scan mode lasting ~10s was used in this study.Three single readings were taken, andthe average score was recorded as the ﬁnal skin carotenoid score.
Before each measurement, participants had their handssanitized or washed, and the device was calibrated daily withthe dark and white reference sticks before starting measure-ments and at least every 2 h when doing multiple skin mea- surements over long periods. Individuals with skin carotenoid scores <150 RU (classi ﬁed as likely to be nutritionally compromised based on the devicemanufacturer ’s recommendation) had a comprehensive ocular assessment to ascertain any VAD presentation in the eye.TheR.Thapa et al.The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1211 –1219 1212 comprehensive dilated eye examination included visual function measures (presenting visual acuity and best-corrected visualacuity), slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and direct or indirectophthalmoscopy.Blood collection Five milliliters of venous blood samples were drawn for serum retinol and carotenoid analyses.
After centrifugation at 2400 /C2g for 5 min, we extracted the serum samples into labeled andcapped cryo tubes and stored them at /C020 /C14C. In instances where immediate centrifugation was not possible, the blood sample waskept at þ4 /C14C for a maximum of 2 d.The serum samples were then shipped on dry ice to the Bernstein Laboratory at the MoranEye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, UnitedStates for serum carotenoid and retinol measurements.Paststudies show that retinol and carotenoids remain stable for /C2115 y when stored at /C020 /C14Co r/C080/C14C[23].Therefore, conditions such as light, heat, and oxygen exposures, which could poten- tially degrade retinol and carotenoids, were kept at the barestminimum during collection, processing, shipment, andextraction.
Serum retinol and carotenoid extraction and analysis Serum retinol and carotenoids were analyzed by reverse- phase HPLC using photodiode array detection as previouslydescribed with slight modi ﬁcations [ 24–26]. In essence, 200 μL of human serum was extracted with ethanol containing 0.1%butylated hydroxytoluene, ethyl acetate, and hexane in suc-cession in a dark room, and then the combined extracts weredried under inert gas.Subsequently, the dried ﬁlm was cleaned with hexane/methanol/distilled water, and the supernatant was recovered and dried.The resulting dried extract was then dissolved in a 200 μL HPLC mobile phase [methanol:methyl tert-butyl ether (80:20, v/v)] and centrifuged at 9600 /C2gfor 10 min.
The clear supernatant phase was injected into anAgilent 1260 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies Inc.).HPLC-diode array detection (DAD) method was developed tosimultaneously determine serum retinol concentrations and themajor carotenoids, including lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptox- anthin, α-carotene, β-carotene, and lycopene from patients ’ serum [ 27]. HPLC analysis was done on a C30 column (YMC Carotenoids; 25 cm length /C24.6 mm internal diameter; main- tained at room temperature) using DAD monitored at 325 and 450 nm wavelengths, 100 μL injection volumes of stan- dards and extracts, and 1 mL/min ﬂow rate for 50 min.Diode array spectra, retention times, and co-elution with authenticstandards identi ﬁed and con ﬁrmed the various carotenoid peaks.
Standard solutions of retinol and each carotenoid of interest were prepared with known concentrations calculated spectro-scopically using appropriate extinction coef ﬁcients and then injected in different volumes to achieve ﬁnal injected amounts. Serum retinol and carotenoid concentrations were quanti ﬁed based on standard curves of known quantities of the authentic carotenoid standards injected into the HPLC system compared with integrated ultraviolet/visible absorbance of their elutedpeaks.Validation of serum vitamin A measurements in the Bernstein Laboratory at the Moran Eye Center is given in SupplementalMethods .We found that our laboratory ’s serum retinol con- centrations had a strong positive correlation with local ClinicalLaboratory Improvement Amendments –certiﬁed diagnostic lab- oratory ’s serum retinol concentrations ( Supplemental Figure 1 ;n ¼14,r¼0.95, P<0.0001).
The favorable comparison between the two laboratories gives credence to the results and conclu- sions of this study. Diagnostic criteria of VAD We categorized VAD using the WHO serum retinol concen- tration diagnostic criteria.Thus, severe de ﬁciency was <200 ng/ mL (<0.70 μmol/L); marginal de ﬁciency was /C21200 and <300 ng/mL ( /C210.70 and <1.05 μmol/L) and normal, /C21300 ng/mL (/C211.05 μmol/L)[ 28].Statistical analyses We developed a special form for detailed data collection.All collected study data were entered, coded, and cleaned using Microsoft Excel 2007.We then imported the Excel data to Sta- tistical Package for Service Solution (IBM SPSS Statistics for Win- dows, Version 27.0, IBM Corp) for thorough analysis.Descriptivestatistics were used to summarize the sample data.
Of note, wewere underpowered to conduct a subgroup analysis in this study.Hence, we show only descriptive statistics for all study tables.Correlation analysis was used to determine bivariate associationsbetween measures of serum retinol and total carotenoid con-centrations, and Veggie Meter assessed skin carotenoid status.Sensitivity and speci ﬁcity values of the Veggie Meter in detecting VAD were computed using skin carotenoid score cutoff obtainedfrom ROC curve, and a Pvalue<0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Results Demographics A total of 332 participants (164 pregnant women and 168 children) were enrolled in this study.Serum retinol and serumcarotenoid concentrations were available for 326 participants(164 pregnant women and 162 children) because a few sampleswere lost or damaged during collection, processing, and ship-ment.The mean age of pregnant women was 24.4 /C64.7 y (range: 15–42 y) and that for children was 10.4 /C61.5 y (range: 8 –12 y).
Table 1 provides the demographic characteristics of all 332 participants enrolled in this study. Serum vitamin A (retinol) analyses Serum retinol concentrations in pregnant women and children Considering serum retinol concentrations, 10.7% of all study participants had severe VAD and 25.8% had marginal VAD.Inpregnant women, 8.5% had severe VAD and 19.5% had marginalVAD.Among the children, 13.0% had severe VAD and 32.1%had marginal VAD (Table 2 ).Vitamin A status in study participants by ecological regions We found that Terai had the highest occurrence of severe and marginal VAD in both pregnant women and children, followedby Hill and Mountain.Table 3 provides vitamin A status for all study participants in these three ecological regions of Nepal.R.Thapa et al.
The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1211 –1219 1213 Correlation of serum total carotenoid concentrations with serum retinol concentrations in study participants Serum total carotenoid concentrations showed a positive statistically signi ﬁcant association with serum retinol concen- trations among pregnant women ( r¼0.447, P<0.001; Figure 1 A and in children ( r¼0.530, P<0.001; Figure 1 B). Skin carotenoid analyses Skin carotenoid scores in all study participants Of all study participants, 27.1% had skin carotenoid scores of <150 RU.Furthermore, skin carotenoid scores <150 RU among pregnant women and children were 23.2% and 31.0%, respec-tively (Table 4 ).Skin carotenoid status in all study participants by ecological regions Tables 5 and 6 show variability in skin carotenoid scores in the three ecological regions (Terai, Hill, and Mountain).

The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1211 –1219 1215 Determining the cutoff level for VAD using skin carotenoid score Presently, there is no standardized skin carotenoid cutoff score that suggests severe VAD, just the device manufacturer ’s recommendation that a skin carotenoid score <150 RU is sug- gestive of substantial nutritional compromise. Hence, we per-formed an ROC analysis to determine the skin carotenoid scorewith the highest sum of sensitivity and speci ﬁcity using com- bined pregnant women and children ’s skin carotenoid scores.
As shown in Figure 4 , the orange plot gives a cutoff skin carotenoid score of 146 RU using only severe VAD (serum retinol concentrations <200 ng/mL; n ¼35) compared with combined marginal VAD and healthy participants (serumretinol concentrations /C21200 ng/mL; n ¼291), whereas the light blue plot has a 185 RU-cutoff based on a combined severeand marginal VAD (serum retinol concentrations <300 ng/mL; n¼119) and healthy participants (serum retinol concentrations /C21300 ng/mL; n ¼207). The device manufacturer ’s reference of 150 RU for probable nutritional compromise compared favor-ably with our calculated optimal cutoff of 146 RU for thedetection of severe VAD.Sensitivity and speci ﬁcity of the Veggie Meter in detecting VAD Among the pregnant women, the sensitivity and speci ﬁcity of the Veggie Meter in detecting severe VAD were 57.1% and82.7%, respectively.Likewise, 61.9% sensitivity and 75.9%speciﬁcity for severe VAD detection were found in children.
Additionally, we found a sensitivity of 60.0% and speci ﬁcity of 79.4% for the combined pregnant women and children(Table 8 ). Discussion In this study, we sought to determine whether skin carotenoid assessment with the Veggie Meter could be a rapid, noninvasivescreening tool for serum vitamin A status in children and preg-nant women of Nepal.We found an overall prevalence of 10.7%VAD among the study participants.Further, the Veggie Meter detected VAD with sensitivity and speci ﬁcity of 60.0% and 79.4%, respectively.FIGURE 2.Serum total carotenoid concentrations statistically corre- lated with skin carotenoid score in pregnant women ( n¼164) (A) and in children ( n¼162) (B).RU, re ﬂection units.FIGURE 3.Serum retinol concentrations and skin carotenoids score were statistically correlated in pregnant women ( n¼164) (A) and in children ( n¼162) (B).RU, re ﬂection units; VAD, vitamin Ad eﬁciency.R.Thapa et al.
The Journal of Nutrition 153 (2023) 1211 –1219 1216 Aﬁnding worth highlighting is the 10.7% prevalence of VAD among the study participants, which is higher than that re- ported in the Nepal National Micronutrient Status Survey [ 12]. Despite the considerable efforts of the government and otherpolicymakers in providing vitamin A supplement and otherintervention programs to mitigate the burden of this life- andvision-threatening disease, VAD continues to be a public healthconcern in Nepal [ 12,29,30].Although VAD is rarely present in developed countries, it is quite problematic in developingcountries where resources are considerably constrained, andonly limited facilities are available to access its biochemicalstatus in the blood [ 2].
Our ﬁndings suggest the need for all authorities, stakeholders, and policymakers to re-examine and strategize the existing programs tailored to reduce VAD among the populace, so that sustainable and pragmatic measures maybe implemented to effectively cover all areas/ecologicalregions. Consistent with other studies, we found VAD prevalence to differ by ecological regions in Nepal, with Terai having thehighest occurrence [ 10,12].Differences in dietary patterns may account for the variation in VAD prevalence across the variousecological regions.For instance, most Mountain inhabitantsusually cultivate and consume food (with good amount ofvitamin A) grown on their jungle lands, whereas individuals inTerai have access to foods (such as potatoes, fried foods, etc.), which are relatively poor dietary sources of vitamin A.
Three strategies —supplementation, food diversity, andbioforti ﬁcation —have been shown to be effective in augment- ing the nutriture of the populace, thereby decreasing VAD [ 31]. However, in Nepal, supplementation has been the main methodof confronting VAD with minimal progress toward food bio-fortiﬁcation and diversity [ 29].Biannual vitamin A supple- mentation programs with nationwide coverage may be challenging considering the workforce and the logistics involved.Therefore, increasing availability, and accessibility toaffordable dietary vitamin A sources (such as fruits and vege-table) backed by appropriate education of the population on theimportance of healthy nutrition could offer sustainable andmeaningful lifestyle interventions and thereby decrease theprevalence of VAD.
Moreover, as the wealth of every countrylies in the health of its people as revealed by the Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good health and wellbeing [32], it is imperative that the Ministry of Health and Population in part- nership with the Ministry of Agriculture and stakeholders implement policies that potentially could increase the produc- tion and consumption of vitamin A rich foods. Again, it is quite dif ﬁcult to improve and monitor vitamin A status when there is an absence of facilities or devices to bio-chemically analyze vitamin A status in a population of over 29million, unless a symptomatic individual presents to an eyehospital for ophthalmological services [ 33].By this time, visual impairment may be irreversible.Therefore, the use of the VeggieMeter to determine VAD holds potential, especially in resourcedlimited jurisdictions, in detecting and instituting treatment ofVAD long before the onset of ocular problems.
The Veggie Meter is advantageous in the sense that: 1)it is portable and can be used in remote areas; 2)provides rapid, repeatable, and consis- tent results that is suggestive of good or poor nutriture; and 3)it is easy to operate and maintain without sophisticated training[16,21,22]. Thus, in countries with no or limited availability of serum vitamin A assessment facilities, the use of the skin carot-enoid assessment equipment as an indirect measure of serumretinol could aid in early detection and possible treatment ofVAD, thereby preventing VAD-associated morbidities and mor-talities.In agreement with other past studies in the United Statesand Japan, we found signi ﬁcant correlations between serum carotenoids and skin carotenoid status [ 19,22].This ﬁnding in- dicates the wide use of the Veggie Meter in measuring skin ca-rotenoids in diverse populations regardless of skin pigmentation.
The strength of our study lies in the fact that this ﬁrst report of the use of the Veggie Meter as a VAD screening tool had a largesample size of over 300 participants, used high quality serumretinol and carotenoid analyses, and yielded consistent resultsfrom two distinct study populations (pregnant women andschool-age children) known to be at risk of VAD in Nepal. Aninherent limitation of our current study lies in the fact that skincarotenoid assessment with the Veggie Meter will always be an indirect biomarker of vitamin A status.In addition, we were underpowered to fully examine regional variations in VAD in a statistically signi ﬁcant manner.Because this is the ﬁrst study to determine the use of the Veggie Meter as a VAD screening tool,this study should be replicated in other regions of the world toensure consistency in the ﬁndings.In conclusion, the VAD prevalence of 10.7% suggests that VAD is still a moderate public health problem in Nepal based onWHO standards [ 34].
