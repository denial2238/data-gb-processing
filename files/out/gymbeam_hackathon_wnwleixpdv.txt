In this study, we established a mouse model of obesity-related AF through high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, and used L-carnitine (LCA, 150 mg/kg ·BW/ d), an endogenous cofactor of carnitine palmitoyl-transferase-1B (CPT1B; the rate-limitingenzyme of FAO) to investigate whether FAO promotion can attenuate the AF susceptibilityin obesity. All mice underwent electrophysiological assessment for atrial vulnerability, andechocardiography, histology and molecular evaluation for AF substrates and underlyingmechanisms, which were further validated by pharmacological experiments in vitro .HFD- induced obese mice increased AF vulnerability and exhibited apparent atrial structuralremodeling, including left atrial dilation, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, connexin-43remodeling and ﬁbrosis.Pathologically, HFD apparently leads to defective cardiac FAO and subsequent lipotoxicity, thereby evoking a set of pathological reactions includingoxidative stress, DNA damage, in ﬂammation, and insulin resistance.
Enhancing FAO via LCA attenuated lipotoxicity and lipotoxicity-induced pathological changes in the atria ofobese mice, resulting in restored structural remodeling and ameliorated AF susceptibility.Mechanistically, LCA activated AMPK/PGC1 αsignaling both in vivo and in vitro , and pharmacological inhibition of AMPK viaCompound C attenuated LCA-induced cardio- protection in palmitate-treated primary atrial cardiomyocytes. Taken together, our resultsdemonstrated that FAO promotion viaLCA attenuated obesity-mediated AF and structural remodeling by activating AMPK signaling and alleviating atrial lipotoxicity.
Thus, enhancingFAO may be a potential therapeutic target for AF.Edited by: Jérôme Roncalli, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, France Reviewed by: Andrea Elia, Temple University, United States Yin Cai, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China *Correspondence: Xinghua Qin xinghuaqin@nwpu.edu.cn Qiangsun Zheng zhengqiangsun@126.com †These authors have contributed equally to this work and share ﬁrst authorship Specialty section: This article was submitted to Cardiovascular and Smooth Muscle Pharmacology, a section of the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology Received: 07 September 2021 Accepted: 12 November 2021 Published: 26 November 2021 Citation: Zhang Y, Fu Y, Jiang T, Liu B, Sun H, Zhang Y, Fan B, Li X, Qin X and Zheng Q (2021) Enhancing Fatty Acids Oxidation viaL-Carnitine Attenuates Obesity-Related Atrial Fibrillation and Structural Remodeling by Activating AMPK Signaling and Alleviating Cardiac Lipotoxicity.

Metabolic disturbances have shown strong relationship with AF by ample clinical evidence, and have been represented as driving forces foradverse atrial remodelling mechanically ( Mourtzinis et al., 2018 ). In addition, regarding cardiac high energy demand, disordered atrial metabolism is supposed to take a leading rolein AF pathogenesis.However, far less is known about the impactsof atrial metabolism in AF.Metabolic homeostasis and abnormalities have spurred major interest in the ﬁeld of AF at present, with a focus on lipids, the predominant energy substrates ( ∼70%) of heart.Under physiological conditions, absorbed cardiac FAs is delivered into mitochondria via the gateway enzyme carnitine palmit oyltransferase-1B (CPT1B), and fueled by mitochondrial FAs oxidation (FAO) and the TCA cycle.Incontext of AF, the metabolic disturbance of FAs was observed andproved to contribute to the predisposition and perpetuation of AF(Mourtzinis et al., 2018 ).
Brie ﬂy, during AF, irregular high-frequency excitation and contraction of cardiomyocytes shift the metabolicbalance from FAO to carbohydrate utilization, a more oxygen-savingway ( Heijman and Dobrev, 2015 ). Supportively, AF patients and animals show the coordinated transcriptional down-regulation ofFAO-related enzymes (especially AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γcoactivator1 α (PGC1 α), and CPT1B) and concomitant up-regulation of glycolysis- related enzymes in atria ( Barth et al., 2005 ;Tu et al., 2014 ; Mourtzinis et al., 2018 ;Jie et al., 2019 ).Supportively, redressing lipid metabolism through factors, such as AMPK, PPAR α/PGC1 α, Hif1- α, VLCAD, and PLIN2, has been proved effective to prevent AF, exemplifying metabolic modulation as a potential therapeuticstrategy for AF ( Harada et al., 2017 ).
Of note, pharmacological interventions targeting FAO regulators, AMPK and PGC1 α(Yu et al., 2011 ;Liu et al., 2016 ;Bai et al., 2019 ;Deshmukh et al., 2021 ; Ostropolets et al., 2021 ), have been proved to reduce AF susceptibility, yet it is still unclear whether enhancing FAOalleviates AF. AF risk escalates in parallel with increased BMI, thus obesity, a public health issue as well as the most common metabolic disorderin human, is regarded as the second biggest attributable risk factorfor AF ( Wong et al., 2015 ).Various pathological conditions including metabolic imbalance of glucose or lipid and metabolicstress has been observed in obesity ( Vyas and Lambiase, 2019 ).Notably, diet-induced obesity increases the in ﬂux of FAs and downregulates the key enzymes involved in FAs expenditure(Haffar et al., 2015 ;Heier and Haemmerle, 2016 ;Garcia and Shaw, 2017 ).
Particularly, in long-term obese individuals, CPT1B is decreased in expression and blunted in response to lipid ( Maples et al., 2015 ), while L-carnitine (LCA), the obligatory cofactor of CPT1B ( Söder et al., 2019 ), is decreased in serum and insufﬁcient to cope with FAs overload ( Pooyandjoo et al., 2016 ).Together, obesity and AF share the same pathogenesis, defective FAO, which might count for the increased AF susceptibility,especially in which are provoked by obesity. Therefore, FAOpromotion maybe the ﬁrst-line option to combat AF, especially obesity-related AF.In pathological context, ectopic lipidaccumulation and consequently lipotoxicity occurred when FAO was defective in cardiomyocyte, serving as a mechanistic link between AF/obesity and metabolic disorder ( Haffar et al., 2015 ; Ozcan et al., 2015 ;Opacic et al., 2016 ;Harada et al., 2017 ).
Speci ﬁcally, cardiac lipotoxicity could provoke oxidative stress, DNA damage, in ﬂammation, and insulin intolerance, contributing morphological changes and cellular dysfunction ofatria ( Karam et al., 2017 ;Sletten et al., 2018 ), including cardiac hypertrophy, ﬁbrosis, gap junction remodeling, and myocardial injury ( Shenasa et al., 2015 ;Fukui et al., 2017 ;Meng et al., 2017 ; Sato et al., 2019 ), thus, providing substrates for AF. Therefore, we adopted LCA (150 mg/kg ·BW/d) to facilitate FAO, and further examined the AF vulnerability and atrial remodeling in vivo (a mice model of high-fat diet (HFD)- induced obesity-mediated AF) and in vitro (a primary atrial cardiomyocyte cell model of palmitate (PA)-mimicked lipidoverloading), aiming to determine whether enhancing FAOcan alter the process that underlie AF in obesity and explorepossible mechanisms.
Our results determined that defectivecardiac FAO takes a leading role in obesity-related AF, andproved that FAO promotion viaLCA exerts an anti-AF effect through activating AMPK signals and reducing atrial lipotoxicityin obese mice. Notably, this article ﬁrstly demonstrates the beneﬁcial effects of enhanced FAO in the reversal of obesity- related AF, thus shedding light onto a feasible AF treatment.METHODS AND MATERIALS Animal and Treatment Male C57BL/6J mice (aged 4 –6 weeks) were purchased from Xi’an Jiaotong University (Xi ’an, China) and bred under standard laboratory conditions.After 1 week ofacclimatization, a total of forty mice were randomly dividedinto 4 groups ( n/equals10 per group): 1) Standard diet group (STD; 20% fat, 56% carbohydrate, 24% protein; Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ); 2) STD + LCA group; 3) HFD group(HFD; 60% fat, 20% carbohydrate, 20% protein; Research DietsInc.); 4) HFD + LCA group.
After feeding HFD for 8 weeks, themice became obese and showed greater propensity for AF.Subsequently, FAO activator, LCA (150 mg/kg ·BW/d; TargetMol, Boston, United States) ( Bakermans et al., 2013 ), was administrated viadrinking water for another 4 weeks. Based on our preliminary experiment, the experimental doseof LCA was set to be 150 mg/kg ·BW/d, which had no signi ﬁcant impact on mice body weight (BW) but suppressed obesity- induced AF susceptibility.At the end of the experiment, AF induction, echocardiography, intraperitoneal glucose tolerancetest (IPGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed in Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 771940 2Zhang et al.Fatty Acids Oxidation and AF each group before tissue sampling.After overnight fasting, atrial tissues and blood samples were collected from euthanized micefor further analysis.
All the procedures of this study wereapproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Xi ’an Jiaotong University. Cell Culture and Treatment Primary atrial cardiomyocytes were isolated from the atria of neonatal Sprague –Dawley rat (1 ∼3-day-old; Xi ’an Jiaotong University, Xi ’an, China).Brie ﬂy, atria tissue were surgically removed, trypsinized (0.08% trypsin; Solarbio, Beijing, China),digested with 0.1% collagenase Ⅱ(Solarbio), and the primary atrial cardiomyocytes were isolated by differential detachmentand veri ﬁed under the microscope.Isolated cells were cultured in 6-well plates at 37 °Ci n5 %C O 2, with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution.Final solutions of 200 μM PA (dissolved in 20% BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, United States) was added to replicate the effects of lipidoverloading, while LCA (5 mM; TargetMol) was added toenhance FAO, and Compound C (CC, 0.5 μM; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to inhibit AMPK activation.
After being treated for24 h, cells were collected, washed and lysed for the followingevaluations. AF Induction and Electrophysiological Examination Programmed trans -esophageal stimulation was performed to assess AF inducibility as described previously ( Fu et al., 2021 ).Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital intraperitoneally (50 mg/kg ·BW) and then electrical stimulated by an external simulator (SCOPE, Kaifeng, China), and surfaceelectrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded by a physiologic signal-acquisition system (RM6240; Chengdu instrument factory,Chengdu, China).At ﬁrst, baseline ECG was analyzed by 10 consecutive beats recorded in the initial stabilization period withheart rates between 300 and 500 bpm at ﬁrst.Later, AF was induced with burst pacing (pulse width 1 ms; 1.5 ×capture threshold; 30, 35, and 40 Hz), and was considered sustained as persisted rapidirregular f-waves with irregular R-R intervals lasting for morethan 1 s.
In addition, atrial effective refractory period (ERP) wasassessed by continuous stimulation applied with decreasing R-Rintervals from 140 to 40 ms at 1 ms decrements. Sinoatrial noderecovery time (SNRT max) was measured as the longest duration between the last stimulus and the ﬁrst sinus P-wave, and corrected by the R-R interval ( cSNRT max).Echocardiography 2D echocardiography was employed to discern cardiac structuraland functional differences among groups.Echocardiography(Vevo 2,100; VisualSonics Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada) wasperformed by an animal cardiologist blind to the experimentaldesign in mice anaesthetized with inhalational iso ﬂurane.Dimension of superoinferior (SI), anteroposterior (AP) andmediolateral (ML) were obtained in a long-axis view and ashort-axis view, respectively.LA ﬁlling volume was calculated using the formula: LA Volume /equals(4π×SI×AP×ML)/(3 ×2×2×2)(Ujino et al., 2006 ).
Cardiac function was calculated according to standard formulae, and the results were averaged of three cardiaccycles. IPGTT and ITT Glucose and insulin homeostasis were evaluated in vivo by IPGTT and ITT.For the IPGTT, D-glucose was injected intraperitoneally(2 g/kg ·BW) into over-night fasted mice, and, subsequently, blood was taken from the tail vein at 5, 15, 30, 60, 90 and120 min after glucose loading and blood glucose levels weremeasured by the Accu-Chek glucometer (Roche Diagnostics,Indianapolis, United States).Similarly, for the ITT, mice werefasted for 2 h before insulin administration intraperitoneally (1U/kg ·BW; Wanbang Biopharma, Xuzhou, China), following the glucose determination at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min.Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) by GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPadSoftware, San Diego, America).
Analysis of Histological Staining and Fluorescence After being isolated from heart tissue, atrial appendages were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, embedded in paraf ﬁn, and cut into 5 µm slides longitudinally. Paraf ﬁn-embedded specimens were ﬁnally stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA), Masson, Periodi c acid-Schiffs (PAS), selected antibodies (connexin-43; 1:200; Invit rogen, California, United States, NRF2; 1:500; Proteintech, Chicago, United States, and 8-Hydroxy-2 ′- deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), 1: 100; JalCA, Shizuoka, Japan), andTUNEL ( in situ cell death detection kit, TMR red; Roche Diagnostics).Respectively, frozen sections (10 µm thickness) ofatria samples were prepared and stained with oil red O, MitoSOXand dihydroethidium (DHE).
Slides were visualized andphotographed by an optical microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY,United States) at a magni ﬁcation of 100 ×for histology, or by a confocal microscope (Leica, Bensheim, Germany) at a magni ﬁcation of 20 ×for immuno ﬂuorescence. Images were further analyzed by ImageJ software (version 1.46r; National Institutes of Health,Bethesda, United States).Data wer ee x p r e s s e da st h ep e r c e n t a g eo f the positive-stained region to the total area of cardiomyocyte area,and averaged from six random ﬁelds in each slide.
Detection of Markers in Serum and Tissue Biomarkers were assayed using commercially available kits in accordance with manufacturer ’s guidelines, including fasted non- esteri ﬁed FAs (NEFA) (Solarbio), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute), malondialdehyde (MDA) (Beyotime Institute ofBiotechnology, Shanghai, China) and superoxide dismutase(SOD) (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). Assay of FAO in vitro Cellular FAO was measured with a FAO Assay Kit (ab222944; Abcam, Cambridge, United States) according to the manufacturer ’s instruction.Fluorescence was detected using FLUOstar Omega Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 771940 3Zhang et al.
Fatty Acids Oxidation and AF (BMG LABTECH, Aylesbury, United Kingdom) and the results were normalized by protein concentration in each well through amicro-bicinchoninic acid (BCA; Pierce Chemical Company,Rockford, United States) kit. Western Blot Protein levels were measured by WB with β-actin as the loading control.Protein was extracted from atria samples or cells andquantitated by a BCA assay.Equal amount (10 –30μg) of protein was loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE using 10 or 12% acrylamidegradients, and later transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
Themembranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and incubated withantibodies against total-AMPK (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology/CST, Massachusetts, United States), CD36 (1:1,000; Abcam),collagen Ⅰ(1:1,000; Abcam), collagen Ⅲ(1:1,000; Abcam), connexin-43 (1:200; Invitrogen), CPT1B (1:1,000; Proteintech), GLUT4 (1:500; Proteintech), NF κB (1:1,000; Proteintech), NRF2 (1:1,000; Proteintech), phoso-AMPK (Thr172; 1:1,000; CST), phoso-Akt (Ser473; 1:1,000; CST), phoso-NF κB (1:1,000; CST), PGC1 α(1: 1,000; Proteintech), SOD2 (1:1,000; Proteintech), TGF- β(1:1,000; Abcam), α-SMA (1:1,000; CST), β-actin (1:5,000; Proteintech). Protein levels were quanti ﬁed as the intensity of bands using ImageJ software (NIH systems) and standardized to β-actin.Abbreviations are fully illustrated in corresponding ﬁgure legends.RNA Extraction and Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction RT-qPCR was carried out to quantify gene expressions among the groups.
Brie ﬂy, RNA from atria tissues was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Accurate Biology, Changsha, China). Then,the high-sensitivity RT-qPCR reaction was measured using theSYBR green chimeric ﬂuorescence method (Accurate Biology) and detected by CFX96 ™Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States).Results were quanti ﬁed using the 2-△△Ctcomparative method and normalized by β-actin.The primer sequences and full names of genes are listed in Supplementary Table S1 .Statistical Analysis All data of animal and cell studies were analyzed by SPSS 23.0 (IBM SPSS software, New York, United States), visualized byGraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software), and shown as mean ± SEM.Replicates are indicated in ﬁgure legends and table legends.Data normality was evaluated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, andcomparisons between groups were performed with One-wayANOVA (in mice experiments) or Two-way ANOVA (in cellexperiments) with Bonferroni post-hoc test.
For all tests, p<0.05 was considered signi ﬁcant. RESULTS LCA Supplementation Attenuates Obesity-Induced AF Susceptibility In this study, we established a mouse model of obesity-related AF through 13-week HFD feeding, and LCA was administrated viadrinking water (150 mg/kg ·BW/d) during the last 4-week period to investigate whether enhancing FAO could attenuate obesity-mediated AF.The schematic of the experimental design is showninFigure 1A , and basal characteristics of mice in each group are summarized in Table 1 .As expected, at the end of the experiment, HFD mice gained 20% more BW than STD mice ( Supplementary Figure S1A ), together with increased hea rt weight (HW) and serum NEFA (Supplementary Figures S1B –D).Obesity-mediated AF was successfully established, as supported by increasedAF frequency and prolonged duration in HFD mice(Figures 1B –D).
LCA decreased the ratio of HW/NAL (nasal-anal length) in HFD mice, yet no signi ﬁcant change of BW gain was observed with or without LCAsupplementation ( Supplementary Figures S1A –C). In addition, LCA suppressed HFD-induced elevation of serum NEFA ( Supplementary Figure S1D ).Of note, LCA supplementation alleviated pacing-induced AF susceptibilityin the obese mice.Surface ECG (Lead II) at baseline showedthat LCA supplementation signi ﬁcantly decreased P-wave duration (P max)a n dP - w a v ea r e a( P area), two of the independent predictors for AF, in obese mice ( Figures 1E–G).In addition, electrophysiological abnormalities, including prolonged SNRT max and shortened ERP, were regarded to increase the AF propensity.Supportively, LCAsupplementation shortened SNRT maxand extended ERP in o b e s em i c e( Figures 1H –L).
LCA Supplementation Constrains Obesity-Induced Atrial StructuralRemodeling Atrial structural remodeling, including atrial dilatation, cellular hypertrophy, gap junction disturbance, and interstitial ﬁbrosis, offers substrates for AF. Thus, we later assessed atrial structural alterations among the groups.Obese mice displayed excessive left atrial enlargement, as shown by marked increase of left atrium (LA) diameter and LAﬁlling volume ( Figures 2A –C).In atrial cardiomyocytes, obesity developed substantial cellular hypertrophy and disarray inthe atria, as evidenced by H&E staining, WGA stainingand β-MHC transcription ( Figures 2D –G).Moreover, the main gap junction protein, connexin-43, was apparentlyupregulated in expression and heterogeneous distributed inthe atrial cardiomyocyte of obese mice ( Figures 2H –J).
In addition, intra-myocardial ﬁbrosis, a hallmark of AF, was observed to increase in the atria of obese mice, as evidenced by aggravated collagen deposition, upregulated pro- ﬁbrosis signaling (TGF- β,α- S M A ,S m a d 3 ,c o l l a g e n Ⅰ, and collagen Ⅲ), and downregulated transcription of anti- ﬁbrotic Smad7 (Figures 2K –O). Coincided with reduced AF inducibility, LCA supplementation showed signi ﬁcant capacity to shrink LA, attenuate cellular hypertrophy, gap junction disturbance, and ﬁbrosis while challenged by a long-term HFD ( Figure 2 ), indicating FAO promotion via LCA supplementation constrained the AF substrates in obese mice.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 771940 4Zhang et al.Fatty Acids Oxidation and AF FIGURE 1 | LCA inhibits obesity –induced AF.(A)Experimental protocols of this study.(B)Representative AF induction by trans -esophageal burst pacing.(C,D) Analysis of AF frequency and duration.

In line with this, apparent lipiddeposition was observed in obese mice. What ’s more, in accordance with reduced AF susceptibility and atrialremodeling, promoting FAO with LCA decreased the atriallipid deposition effectively in obese mice ( Figures 3A,B ).Promoted FAs in ﬂux and defective FAO can predispose to lipid deposition ( Figure 3C ).Thus, ﬁrstly, we assessed factors involved in lipid uptake and transportation.CD36, the main trans -membrane translocase of FAs, was decreased in gene level in obesity, and increased after LCA treatment ( Figure 3D ).However, CD36 was unchanged in total protein level amongthe groups ( Figure 3E ), but elevated in atrial membrane translocation in obese mice, and slightly reduced after LCAsupplementation ( Figures 3F,G ).Besides, the transcription of other transportation-related genes, FABP3 and FABP-pm, wasdecreased in the atria of obesity and restored after LCA supplementation ( Figure 3D ).
Next, we evaluated the expression of the key enzymes of FAO, including CPT1B, AMPK and PGC1 α, by RT-qPCR and Western blot. In contrast to increased FAs uptake, mitochondrial FAO wasdownregulated in obesity, as evidenced by the remarkabledecrease of AMPK phosphorylation, and PGC1 αexpression in the atria of HFD mice compared to STD mice ( Figures 3H –L).Notably, LCA supplementation upregulated the phosphorylationof AMPK as well as the expression of PGC1 αand CPT1B in HFD mice ( Figures 3D –L).
LCA Supplementation Restrains Cardiac Oxidative Stress and DNA Damage in theAtria of Obese Mice Lipid over-deposition undermines the structure of cardiomyocytes, namely, cardiac lipotoxicity ( Sletten et al., 2018 ), thereby provoking a set of pathological processes, including oxidative in ﬂammation, DNA damage and insulin resistance, which have been implicated as possible mechanismsTABLE 1 | Physical characteristics, echocardiographic, surface ECG and electrophysiological parameters, and serum marker levels of STD, STD + LCA, HFD and H FD + LCA mice.

LCA supplementation thwarted oxidative damagesprovoked by HFD, as supported by the decreased MitoSOX Redand DHE ﬂuorescence signal, the reduced MDA levels and the rise of SOD levels in the serum and atria of obese mice ( Figures 4A –H).Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2) is an accepted master regulator participating in the cellular adaptive response to redox or energy stress, which accumulates in nuclearto induce a battery of defensive genes encoding detoxifyingenzymes and antioxidant proteins (such as SOD2 and NF κB) (Figure 4E )(Tonelli et al., 2018 ).Next, we evaluated the NRF2- mediated cardio-protective pathways.Nuclear levels of NRF2were comparably decreased in the atria of obese mice, andincreased after LCA supplementation ( Figures 4J,K ).In addition, total protein level of NRF2 was elevated after LCAsupplementation.
In parallel with the distinct NRF2 activation,SOD2, one of the downstream of NRF2 for antioxidant defense, was noticeably increased in the atria of obese mice after LCA treatment ( Figures 4L,M ). Consistent with obesity-induced oxidative stress, oxidative DNA damage (as shown by 8-OH-dG staining) and DNAsegment (as shown by TUNEL staining) in the atira wasaggravated after HFD, and were alleviated by LCA ( Figures 4N–Q).Moreover, we evaluated myocardial cellular damage by measuring serum LDH and CK-MB levels.Obesityincreased LDH levels apparently, yet LCA treatmentunaffected its levels in obese mice.CK-MB is a more speci ﬁc marker of myocardial cellular damage, and results showed that obesity unaffected serum CK-MB levels, yet LCA treatment reduced its levels ( Figures 4R,S ) in obese mice.
LCA Supplementation Mitigates Obesity-Related Atrial In ﬂammatory Response Next, we determined the transcription of pro-in ﬂammation cytokines in the atria, including IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-18, TNF- α, FIGURE 2 | LCA suppresses atrial remodeling in obese mice.

LCA Supplementation Improves Insulin Sensitivity in Obese Mice Disordered glucose metabolism and insulin resistance are also novel risk factors for AF and usually occur in obesity ( Nakamura and Sadoshima, 2020 ). Therefore, apart from FAs metabolism, the impacts of LCA on glycometabolism, including insulinsignaling and insulin resistance, glucose and insulin tolerance,are also investigated in this study.Both IPGTT ( Figures 5A –C) and ITT ( Figures 5D –F) conﬁrmed glucose metabolic imbalance in obesity, including increased fasting blood glucose (FBG), impaired glucosetolerance, and decreased insulin sensitivity.Intriguingly, LCAhad no effect on glucose tolerance and FBG, yet increased insulintolerance in obese mice, indicating improved insulin sensitivity inperipheral tissues.Mechanistic investigation using WB analysisshowed that LCA restored the serine/threonine protein kinasePKB (Akt) phosphorylation in the atria of obese mice(Figure 5G ).
Moreover, although LCA treatment had no effect on GLUT4 expression, its activation, as re ﬂected by its translocation to the intracellular membrane, was promoted in obese mice ( Figures 5H –J). Next, we assessed the transcription of glucose metabolism-related genes, including GLUT1, GLUT4,HK2, PFKM, PKM2, and PDK4.Most of these genes, except forPFKM, were inhibited in the atria of obese mice.LCAsupplementation increased the transcription of GLUT4, PKM2,and PDK4, whereas decreased PFKM transcription in obese mice(Figure 5K ).In addition, PAS staining showed aggravated glycogen accumulation in the atria of obese mice.LCA furtherincreased glycogen accumulation in atrial cardiomyocytes(Figures 5L,M ), probably due to the fact that LCA upregulated glucose uptake more than glycolysis ( Figure 5N ).
Inhibition of AMPK Constrains the Cardio-Protective Effects of LCASupplementation in vitro To investigate whether AMPK is crucial in LCA-conferred cardio-protection, we used PA, a saturated fatty acid, to mimicobesity in vitro, and CC, a pharmacological inhibitor of AMPK, toblock AMPK signaling in primary atrial cardiomyocytes (Figure 6A ). LCA enhanced FAO signi ﬁcantly in PA-treated cells, which might be ascribe to the activation AMPK andupregulation of PGC1 αand CPT1B; however, inhibition of AMPK by CC reversed these effects ( Figures 6C,D ).MDA examination was performed to assess the levels of oxidative stress.In line with the animal studies, LCAsupplementation induced a decrement of PA-inducedoxidative stress (Decreased cellular MDA) and enhanced corresponding anti-oxidative system (Restored NRF2/SOD2 signaling) in primary atrial cardiomyocytes; however,pretreatment with CC abolished LCA-conferred antioxidanteffects.
Similarly, pretreatment with CC also attenuated LCA-conferred anti-in ﬂammation effects, as judged by NF κB activation ( Figures 6E –G). Altogether, these results supported that activation of AMPK signaling pathway may be the relevant molecular basis of LCA-mediated cardio-protection.DISCUSSION Although defective FAO has long been pronounced in AF, itsimplication in AF is under-investigated.In this study, weestablished an obesity (induced by HFD)-related AF micemodel, which showed increased AF vulnerability and exhibitedapparent atrial structural remodeling ( Figures 1 ,2).Pathologically, obesity caused defective cardiac FAO and induced cardiac lipotoxicity ( Figure 3 )(Haffar et al., 2015 ), thereby evoking a set of pathological reactions, includingoxidative stress, DNA damage, in ﬂammation and insulin resistance ( Figures 4 ,5), which contributing to AF.
Enhancing FAO via LCA supplementation (the cofactor of CPT1B), attenuated cardiac steatosis and lipotoxicity-inducedpathological changes in the atria of obese mice, resulting inrestored AF substrates and ameliorated AF susceptibility(Figure 7 ). Mechanistically, AMPK/PGC1 αsignaling was implicated in LCA-conferred bene ﬁcial effects against obesity- mediated AF ( Figure 6 ).The derangement of the energy substrate metabolism in the pathogenesis of AF has garnered extensive interest in the ﬁeld of AF.Ample of proteomics and metabolomics studies have provedthe considerable lipid metabolism remodeling in the myocardiumof AF patients ( Huang et al., 2011 ;Tu et al., 2014 ).Dyslipidemia is independently associated with AF incidence ( Guan et al., 2020 ), and lipid metabolism related proteins serve as a potential AFbiomarker (such as LDL, VLDL, HDL, and FABP3) ( Golaszewska et al., 2019 ).
Enzymes involved in FAO (such as CD36, CPT1B and VLCAD), as well as their regulators (such as PPAR- αand PGC1 α), are demonstrated to inhibited in chronic AF ( Liu et al., 2016 ). These evidence supported the impaired FAs uptake andFIGURE 3 |P G C 1 α) by Western blot.Scale bar: 50 μmn/equals4 per group.One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to compare data among groups.Data are expressed as mean ±SEM.* p<0.05, ** p<0.01.STD, standard diet; HFD, high-fat diet; LCA, L-carnitine; FAs, fatty acids; FAO, fatty acids oxidation; AMPK, AMP- activated protein kinase; CD36, FAT; CPT1B, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1B; PGC1 α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γcoactivator1 α; FABP-pm, plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein; FABP3, fatty acid binding protein 3; p-, phoso-.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 771940 9Zhang et al.

(Continued ) Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 771940 10Zhang et al. Fatty Acids Oxidation and AF defective FAO, along with increased atrial lipid deposition of AF (Lenski et al., 2015 ), suggesting disordered lipid metabolism is closely related to the occurrence and development of AF ( Opacic et al., 2016 ).Consequently, from a broader metabolic perspective, redressing the disbalance of lipid metabolism should beconsidered as a novel a candidate strategy for AF.Supportively, AMPK, an effective lipid metabolism accelerator, and its downstream effectors, PPAR- α/PGC-1 αsignals, both have been proposed as alternative metabolic modulations to combatAF (Harada et al., 2015 ;Bai et al., 2019 ;Ostropolets et al., 2021 ).Genetic deletion of liver kinase B1, an activator of AMPK, candevelop spontaneous AF in mice ( Ozcan et al., 2015 ).
Besides, in agreement with inactivated AMPK signaling in atria in long-standing AF ( Harada et al., 2015 ), restoring FAO targeting AMPK, PPAR- αor PGC1 α(Metformin, AICAR, Feno ﬁbrate and β 3AR) ( Yu et al., 2011 ;Liu et al., 2016 ;Bai et al., 2019 ; Deshmukh et al., 2021 ;Ostropolets et al., 2021 ) have been conﬁrmed to suppress AF inducibility. However, AMPK, a key regulator of multi-pathways and multi-targets, also gets involvedin inﬂammation mitigation, Ca 2+-handling and cell contraction, mitochondrial biogenesis, cell growth and proliferation, and soon, thus exerting cardiovascular protection with a combination ofmultiple mechanisms ( Garcia and Shaw, 2017 ).Therefore, the cardio-protective effect of AMPK-mediated pathways cannot bedifferentiated from FAO promotion.It is worthy to evaluated thedirect effects of accelerated FAO on AF, especially incircumstances of obesity, in which cardiac FAO is defectiveconsiderably compared to other well-known ‘culprits ’of the AF.
As expected, we proved that boosting FAO viaLCA, a natural and biologically active micronutrient enhancingphysiological FAO through CPT1B ( Marcovina et al., 2013 ) and activation of AMPK signaling pathway ( Figures 3 ,6), can signiﬁcantly reduce obesity-mediated AF propensity and the corresponding atrial remodeling ( Figures 1 ,2), thus better supports the ef ﬁciency of FAO promotion in the AF therapeutic approach. Whereas, in opposite to our theory, FAO suppression via Ranolazine has been demonstrated to attenuate AF occurrence in1-week ACh-CaCl 2-exposed rats ( Zou et al., 2016 ), probably by supporting the transient supply/demand mismatch during the stabilization of AF ( Heijman and Dobrev, 2015 ).This controversial result can be further explained by the nonspeci ﬁc confounding in ﬂuence of Ranolazine, since it directly blocks the late sodium channel to terminate arrhythmia, and attenuatesadverse myocardial alterations including hypertrophy andﬁbrosis ( De Angelis et al., 2016 ).
More notably, prolonged inhibition of FAO would presumably increase cardiacpreference for carbohydrate sources, which represents adriving force for atrial electrical remodeling as well as followed irreversible structural remodeling after a long period ( Kolwicz and Tian, 2011 ); and in addition induces atrial lipid accumulation, which promotes lipotoxicity-provoked AF(Young et al., 2002 ;Lundsgaard et al., 2020 ). Over-accumulation of lipid in cardiomyocyte cytosol occurs when FAs supply fails to match the needs created by FAs expenditure, thus is commonly observed in obesity ( Haffar et al., 2015 ) as well as AF ( Lenski et al., 2015 ).Notably, cardiac steatosis in atria exerts detrimental impacts on heart(termed “lipotoxicity ”), thus taking a leading role in AF, especially in obesity-related AF ( Haffar et al., 2015 ;Opacic et al., 2016 ).
For instance, excess myocardial FAs can convert into potentially“lipotoxic ”metabolites, such as diacylglycerol and ceramides (Serra et al., 2013 ), which directly affect excitation-contraction coupling and ion channel/pump integrity, and later contribute toirreversible structure alterations ( Harada et al., 2017 ). Besides, lipid-derived excessive oxidants generation and impaired antioxidant capacity (inactivated NRF2-cascade) lead to redoximbalance and trigger in ﬂammatory response ( Li et al., 2019 ), which are in line with progressively deterioration of myocardialstructure and function ( Goldberg et al., 2012 ), including LA enlargement, and myocardial hypertrophy, connexin-43remodeling, interstitial ﬁbrosis in the atria ( Harada et al., 2017 ).What ’s more, cardiac lipotoxicity causes insulin dysregulation and glycometabolism impairment ( Nakamura and Sadoshima, 2020 ), which are speculated to provide a metabolic arrhythmogenic substrate for AF ( Maria et al., 2018 ).
Cardiac lipotoxicity induced by HFD was further delineated in this study, and ameliorated after FAO promotionwhich redressed the disbalance of lipid metabolism andnormalized the cardiac lipid content, thus explained thecorrelation between defective FAO and AF/obesity ( Figures 3 –5). Disordered glucose metabolism and insulin homeostasis are also active metabolic subjects in the study of AF.Prior researchershave established strong correlation between inadequate glycemiccontrol and AF episodes ( Dublin et al., 2010 ).Within cardiomyocytes, suppressed atrial glucose oxidation andincreased glycogen synthesis occur in AF and promote marked glycogen accumulation ( Heijman and Dobrev, 2015 ).Besides, insulin resistance is considered as a novel independent risk factorfor AF, which engenders both atrial structural remodeling andabnormal intracellular calcium homeostasis ( Chan et al., 2019 ; Wu et al., 2014 ).
What ’s more, insulin signaling loss, noted as impaired glucose transport (alterations in the expression and trafﬁcking of GLUT4), has been proposed to be an early pathogenic factor of AF pathogenesis ( Maria et al., 2018 ).

Fatty Acids Oxidation and AF triacylglycerol, such as diacylglycerol, ceramides and acylcarnitines, are responsible for severe insulin resistance byinterrupting insulin signal cascade at different levels and multiplesteps of glucose metabolism ( Belfort et al., 2005 ;Yazici and Sezer, 2017 ).

However, our results implied the activated Akt and upregulated subsequentglucose utilization in the atria may be the reason why LCAsupplementation can recover the glucose metabolism andinsulin homeostasis, and thus expanding the potential role ofFAO promotion viaLCA in AF suppression. Although present observations have unveiled the practical meaning of promoted FAO viaLCA in obesity-dependent AF, and indicating the leading role of FAO in AF pathogenesis, thisstudy failed to directly assess the ef ﬁciency of FAs uptake or FAO in vivo , and whether the LCA-conferred anti-AF effects is mediated by AMPK also needs con ﬁrmation in vivo .Further investigative work is warranted to address the limitation.CONCLUSION In conclusion, we present for the ﬁrst time that FAO promotion via LCA could redress lipid metaboli sm imbalance and reduce cardiac lipotoxicity through AMPK activatio n, thereby ameliorating obesity- mediated AF and atrial structural remodeling.
Enhancing FAO mayoptimize the therapeutic strate gy for AF, especially in obesity.
