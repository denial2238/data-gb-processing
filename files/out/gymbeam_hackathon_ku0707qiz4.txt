Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the trend (between 2005–2006 and 2015–2016) in receiving weekly iron supplementation (WIS) among children aged 6–59 mo, and factors associated with receiving WIS during 2015–2016. Methods: Two waves of the nationally representative cross-sectional National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data collected during 2005–2006 (NFHS-3) and 2015–2016 (NFHS-4) were used.The trend was measured using both rounds of datasets, whereas factors associated with WIS receiptwere assessed from NFHS-4.The trend was assessed using a sample of 35,650 children from NFHS-3 and 202,227 children from NFHS-4.After exclusion of 8978 cases, a total of 199,110 children were included to analyze the factors associated with receiving WIS.Using appropriate sample weighting, unadjusted and adjusted (multivariate) logistic regression analyses were deployed.Application of the chi-squared test and checking f or multicollinearity were also part of the analysis.
The possibility of sample selection bias was tested. Results: An increase of WIS receipt (from 4.6% in 2005–2006 to 26% in 2015–2016) was observed.Older children, children living in rural areas, children belonging to Scheduled Tribes, children of mothers with secondary education or higher, and children whose mothers had some massmedia exposure had higher odds of receiving WIS.Children of ﬁfth or higher birth order, children who were followers of Islam and Christianity, children from the richest economic group, noninstitutional birth of children, and children from high-focus group states were negatively associate d with WIS receipt.Conclusions: Despite improvement (between 2005–2006 and 2015–2016) in receiving WIS, coverage remains unacceptably low (in absolute terms).The suboptimum performance of WIS intervention demands further investigation.Curr Dev Nutr 2021;5:nzab020 .

This high burden of cases poses a daunting challenge not only to India’s public health system from in-creased risk of child mortality, but due to the adverse consequences of irondeficiencyanemia(IDA)oncognitivedevelopment,schoolperfor- mance,andphysicaldevelopmentofchildren,andworkproductivityinadulthood ( 2–4). Anemia is multifactorial, and it is estimated that halfof anemia cases are due to IDA ( 5) ,w h i c hc o u l db et r e a t e dw i t hi r o n supplementation( 4,6).To mitigate anemia among children, the Indian government launched the National Nutritional Anaemia Control Program in 1970(7),andsincethenvariouseffortshavebeenmadetoreducetheanemia burdenwithnegligiblesuccess.ThecurrentprimeministerofIndiahas respondedtotheimportanceofreducinganemiawiththeintroductionof the Anemia Mukt Bharat (literally “Anemia-Free India”) movement (8).
According to the current guidelines of the National Iron Plus Ini- tiative (NIPI) introduced in 2011 ( 9), iron-and-folic-acid (IFA) tablets 1 2Rai et al. or equivalent syrup should be given to individuals across various age groups of children and women in all states and union territories of In- dia.Allchildrenaged6–59moaretobegivena1mLdoseofIFAsyrup containing20mgofelementalironand100mcgoffolicacidbiweekly,alongwithbiannualdewormingforchildrenaged12moandabove.Un- derNIPI,childrenaged6–59moshouldbeadministeredbiweeklywith IFAsupplementationunderdirectsupervisionoftheAccreditedSocial HealthActivist(ASHA)workersonfixeddays(recommendeddaysare Monday and Thursday).NIPI is expected to benefit over 124 millionchildreninIndia.AlthoughtheexecutionandeffectivenessofNIPIhave been questioned ( 7,8,10,11), a recent report of the 2016–2018 Com- prehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) showed a reduction inanemia among children( 12).
Thoughmanystudiesandreportshaveexaminedfactorsassociated with the burden of anemia among children ( 13–17), a serious dearth in research on determinants of receiving iron supplementation among children hinders devising an appropriate intervention. Existing studies (18,19) on this issue either lack external validity or are outdated.Also, datatoanalyzetheperformanceoftheNIPIprogramarenotavailable, which calls for exploring existing publicly available datasets.Against this evidence gap, using 2 consecutive waves of the nationally repre-sentativeNationalFamilyHealthSurvey(NFHS),weassessedthetrend (between2005–2006and2015–2016)inweeklyreceiptofiron(tabletor syrup)supplementation(WIS)amongchildrenaged6–59mo,andfac- tors associated with receiving the supplement in 2015–2016.
An add- on analysis of understanding how the receipt of WIS differs with theanemia status of children in different states/union territories was also undertaken,alongwithananalysisoftheburdenofanemiaandpreva- lenceofWISreceiptin640districtsofIndianduring2015–2016.Find-ings from this study are hopefully useful to understand the strengths andlimitationsofWIS andthe ongoing NIPIprogram. Methods Dataset Datasets used for this study were obtained from the third (2005–2006) (20) and fourth (2015–2016) ( 21) waves of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), popularly known as NFHS in India.NFHS is across-sectionalsurvey,coveringanationallyrepresentativesample,and collects essential indicators on public health, demography, and vital components of clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical measures.
NFHS was conducted under the stewardship of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and the InternationalInstituteforPopulationSciences,Mumbai,India,wasthenodalagency for conducting the survey. NFHS 2005–2006 (NFHS-3) and NFHS 2015–2016 (NFHS-4) used a sampling frame of India’s 2001 Censusand 2011 Census, respectively.NFHS-3 covered 124,385 women (aged 15–49 y) and 69,751 men (aged 15–54 y) living in 109,041 households, whereas NFHS-4 covered 699,686 women and 112,122 men of thesame age group, and both surveys had over a 95% response rate.Further details about the NFHS sampling procedure can be found in i tspublishedr epo rts( 20,21).Keeping with the study objective, this study included children who were aged 6–59 mo.Information on children was provided by their mothers, including information on WIS.
To assess the trend of WISreceipt (between 2005–2006 and 2015–2016), a sample of 35,650 chil- dren(unweighted)fromNFHS-3andasampleof202,227children(un- weighted) from NFHS-4 were compared, representing 28 states/union territories in both NFHS-3 and NFHS-4. To examine factors associ-atedwithWISreceipt,asampleof199,110children(unweighted)from NFHS-4 was analyzed (8978 children were excluded from the analysis dueto unavailability of information on their social group).The deriva- tion of the sample of 199,110 children is presented in Figure 1.A s the exclusion of cases may lead to biased findings, the sample of 8978children was compared with 199,110 children to rule out the possibil- ity of sample selection bias.It is worth noting that NFHS-4 covered 37states/unionterritoriesand640districtsofIndia,butnodistrict-levelinformationwasavailableinNFHS-3.
Outcome measure In both NFHS-3 and NFHS-4, women aged 15–49 y were asked about the history of receiving iron supplementation (tablet or syrup) for all theirchildrenborninthe5yprecedingthesurveydate.Thus,childrenbornin2001orafterandchildrenbornin2011orafterwereeligibleto be included in the analysis from NFHS-3 and NFHS-4, respectively. In theNFHS,womenwereasked:“Inthelast7d,was(nameofthechild)given iron pills or iron syrup?” While asking the question, a sample of common iron tablets and iron syrups were shown to the respondent to reducerecallerrors.Theresponsewasrecordedas“yes,”“no,”or“don’tknow.” The responses against don’t know were negligible ( <1%), pos- sibly because women only had to recall for the past 1 wk.No further information on WIS was collected.Information on receiving iron sup-plementationinthepast7dfromthesurveydatewasdefinedas“weekly ironsupplementation”orWISinthisstudy.
Potential predictors Guided by the existing literature on receipt of iron-and-folic-acid sup- plementation in India ( 10,11,18, 19,22), a range of potential predic- torswasadoptedtounderstandthefactorsassociatedwithWISreceipt.
The predictors and their subgroups (in parentheses) are age of chil- dren in years (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), sex of child (male and female), child’sbirth order (first, second, third, fourth, and fifth or higher), areas of residence (urban and rural), religion (Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, and others), social group (others, Scheduled Castes, Sched-uled Tribes [STs], and Other Backward Classes), wealth index (poor- est, poorer, middle, richer, and richest), mother’s age (in completed years) at birth of her children ( <17, 17–19, 20–24, 25–29, and ≥30), mother’s education (no or incomplete primary, primary or incomplete secondary, and secondary or higher), delivery care (institutional andnoninstitutional), mass media exposure (no exposure and some expo- sure),states/unionterritories(high-focusgroupstates/unionterritories andnonhigh-focusgroupstates/unionterritories),andanemiastatusofchildren(anemicandnonanemic).

The place of delivery is relevant because children born in a health facility may haveahigherchanceofreceivingWIS.TheNFHSaskedwomenabout CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NUTRITION Iron supplementation among Indian children 3 FIGURE 1 Flow chart on derivation of sample size.NFHS-4, National Family Health Survey 2015–2016; WIS, weekly iron supplementation.their frequency of reading a newspaper or magazine, frequency of lis- teningtoaradio,andfrequencyofwatchingtelevisiononaweeklyba- sis.
Women having no engagement with any of these 3 forms of mass media were identified as having no exposure to mass media, otherwisethey were classifiedas having someformofmass mediaexposure ( 25). On account of high fertility and high mortality indicators, 9 states are regardedashigh-focusstatesinneedofspecialattention:Bihar,Chhat-tisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Assam ( 26).The Indian government runs various public health interventions targeting high-focus states, thus one mayexpect that children residing in high-focus states have higher odds of receiving WIS than in other states.
Anemia status among children was consideredtobeoneofthepotentialpredictorsofWISreceipt.InIndia,trained community health workers from the local public health facility are expected to test children for anemia and based on the diagnosis, childrenareexpectedtoreceivehealthcareadvice.Hence,onemayalsoexpectthatanemicchildrenhaveahigherprobabilityofreceivingWIS compared with nonanemic children. In this study, we tested this hy- pothesis.To measure the anemia level, a HemoCue device was used inboth NFHS-3 and NFHS-4 for testing capillary blood samples.A de- tailed protocol for collecting blood samples and processing them has beenelaboratedinNFHS’ssurveymanuals.Childrenwithahemoglobin concentrationof <11.0g/dLwereconsideredanemic( 9).Statistical approach A combination of bivariate and multivariate analyses was used.
Bivari- ate analysis was used to assess the proportional difference of childrenwho received WIS, and how it varies with anemia status of children by states/union territories and select background characteristics. Lin- earregressionwasruntoassesstheassociationbetweenWISreceiptand anemiaburdenin640districtsofIndia.Byrunningachi-squared( χ 2) test, the sample of 199,110 was compared with the sample of 8978 ex- cludedfromtheanalysis,tocheckifbothsamplesdifferfromeachother by age and sex.Comparing both samples, a χ2level of significance of ≥0.05indicatesnodifferencebetweentheincludedandexcludedsam- ples, thus reducing the probability of sample selection bias.

ReviewBoardofthenodalagency,appointedbytheMinistryofHealth and Family Welfare, Government of India.Prior to making NFHS data public, all participant identifiers were removed from the dataset, thusnoseparateethicalapprovalwasrequiredforthisstudy.Results As8978childrenwereexcludedfromasampleof208,088childrenand left 199,110 children for analyzing factors associated with WIS receipt,a test of sample selection bias was conducted by comparing the age andsexof8978childrenwith199,110children.Achi-squared( χ 2)test found that the excluded sample was not statistically different from thesampleincludedintheanalysis( P≥0.05),withestimationsof χ 2=5.87; P=0.209forage,and χ2=2.31; P=0.129forsex.
The prevalence of anemia among children, the percentage of chil- drenwhoreceivedWIS,andhowWISreceiptvarieswithanemiastatus in 28 states/union territories were estimated for NFHS-3 (2005–2006) and NFHS-4 (2015–2016), as presented in Table 1.O v e r a l l ,t h ep r e v a - lenceofanemiadecreasedfrom69.6%inNFHS-3to58.7%inNFHS-4, andWISreceiptalsoincreasedfrom4.6%inNFHS-3to26%inNFHS- 4.InthestateofGoaandintheunionterritoryofDelhi,althoughWISreceipt increased over time, the prevalence of anemia also increased. Nationally, though negligible, anemic children had a lower prevalence of receiving WIS compared with nonanemic children, in both rounds ofNFHS.InSupplementary Table 1 , from NFHS-4, prevalence (%) of chil- drenwhoreceivedWISandprevalenceofchildrenwhowerediagnosed withanemiain640districtswasestimated.ThelowestcoverageofWIS receiptamongchildrenwasestimatedintheLonglengdistrictofN aga-land (0.5%), and the highest was in the Mandya district of Karnataka (75.3%).
To understand the district-w ise relation between WIS receipt and prevalence of anemia among children, Figure 2 was developed. With an R 2value of 0.002 in linear regression, this relation seems to beveryweak.Prevalence of children receiving WIS by select background charac- teristics and factors associated with it are presented in Table 2.P r i o r torunningtheunadjustedandadjustedmultivariatelogisticregression analysis, VIF was estimated to verify multicollinearity.All VIF valueswere<5 indicating the probability of multicollinearity is low (data not shown separately).

Discussion To reduce an unacceptably high burden of anemia, the Indian government introduced NIPI in 2011, which prescribes the biweekly IFA supplementation for children aged 6–59 mo.Data to analyze the performance of the NIPI program are not available.
Instead, using2 consecutive waves of nationally representative NFHS data, this study examinedthetrendofreceivingWISamongchildrenaged6–59mobe- tween2005–2006and2015–2016,andfactorsassociatedwithreceivingWISin2015–2016. Findingsrevealthatwithincreasedage,childrenweremorelikelyto receiveWIS.ThisfindingisconsistentwithstudiesconductedinAfrica,which showed that with increasing age, children aged 6–59 mo were morelikelytoreceivehealthcare( 29),asistrueinIndia( 30).Although the association of WIS with increased age demands further investiga-tion, one can safely comment that compliance with WIS among chil- drenagedunder1yislowerthanamongrelativelyolderchildren.Previ- ousstudiesconductedinIndia( 31)andNigeria( 32)demonstratedthat children from higher birth order had lower odds of healthcare utiliza- tion, which may be reflected in this study’s findings that children fromfifth or higher birth order had a lower chance of receiving WIS.

thisfindingwarrantsfurtherinvestigation,apreviousstudyalsofound that followers of Islam had lower odds of healthcare utilization ( 33). Children from ST households had higher odds of receiving WIS comparedwithchildrenbelongingtothe“Others”socialgroup.Amongallsocialgroups,STsareconsideredthemostdisadvantagedwithlower income and education, whereas “others” are historically a more privi- legedgroup( 34);also,STsgenerallyhavelowhealthcareserviceutiliza- tion for their children ( 35) and higher WIS receipt could be attributed CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NUTRITION Iron supplementation among Indian children 7 tosuccessofthegovernmentoftargetingtheNIPIprogramtoSTchil- dren.Receipt of WIS among the richest children is lower than among thepoorestchildren.AswiththecaseofhigherlevelsofWISconsump- tioninruralareaswhichareheavilytargetedbythegovernment,higherincome areas may be neglected under programs like NIPI, as it is as- sumed that children in these households are less deprived.
However, this hypothesis would require further investigation. Children born to mothers between the age of 25 and 29 y, and children of mothers with secondary education or higher were positively associated with receiv-ing WIS.Mother’s education and mother’s age at childbirth could be linked (36)a st h eb i r t ho fc h i l d r e nb e t w e e nt h ea g eo f2 5a n d2 9yi s indicativeofhigherageatmarriageandopportunityofeducationofthemother which may lead to better healthcare utilization for their chil- dren (37).Exposure to mass media and children’s birth at a healthcare facility could increase the odds of receiving WIS, as both events havethepotentialtoeducatemothersabouttheimportanceofspecificchild healthcarepractices,andinthiscase,mothersseemedtohavehadsome exposuretotheimportanceofWISfortheirchildren.Finally,althoughsome improvement in receipt of WIS was observed during 2005–2016, multivariateanalysisrevealsthatreceiptofWISwasnotassociatedwith anemia status of children.
This finding may be explained by the factthatWISintervention,eitherbypublicorprivateinstitution,isnotcon- tingent upon a child’s anemia status, and is given to all children aged 6–59 mo. Secondly, this finding could be indicative of the fact that the strategy of testing and treating anemia was not put in place effectively.ThisfindingdoesnotsuggestthattheWISinterventionisnotaneffec-tive intervention to reduce the burden of anemia and careful interpre- tationofthisfindingisneeded.The findings of this study are not free from caveats.First, results should be interpreted with caution as this study uses cross-sectional data,thuscausalinferenceshouldbeavoided.Second,mostoftheinfor- mation about children is based on the recall of mothers.Any errors inrecallarelikelytobenondifferentialwithrespecttothepredictorsbeing examined and thus the associations may have been stronger.
Third, all potentialpredictorsofreceiptofWISwerenotavailablewiththedatasetused (for example, adequacy of supply of iron tablet or syrup). Despite theselimitations,theanalysisofnationallyrepresentativedatawithhigh externalvalidityistheprimarystrengthofthestudy,andthesefindingscould be useful for strengthening the ongoing NIPI program as well as anemiareductionpolicyforchildren.Toconclude,thisstudyfindsthatWISreceipthasincreasedbetween 2005–2006and2015–2016,buttheprevalenceofWISstillremainsun- acceptablylow(inabsoluteterms),andthegapindistrict-wiseWIScov-erageissubstantial.Althoughthereissomeindicationofsuccessofthe NIPIprograminpockets,aproperevaluationofNIPIisneeded.WISto childrenwasnotassociatedwiththeiranemiastatus,thereforetheNIPIprogram should focus greater attention on districts with higher ane- mia burden.
Furthermore, children of fifth or higher birth order, non- Hinduhouseholdchildren,higherincomehouseholdchildren,childrennot born at a health facility, and children from high-focus group states shouldreceivespecialattentionastheyhadlowaccesstoWIS.
