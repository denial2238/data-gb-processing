These online websites do not always offerquality-assured products, and are outside the regular distribution channels ofmedicines. The aim of this study was to estimate the availability and accessibleinformation on the Internet about the sale of three doping substances(oxandrolone, DHEA, androstenedione).Methods: Cross-sectional exploratory study, being an observation at a point in time of the online availability of these three doping substances (WADA S1 category:anabolic agents), purchased from Spain, Puerto Rico, Canada, United States,Ukraine and Russia.The characteristics of the websites, the countries the webssold to, the pharmaceutical forms offered and the recommendations for its use were analyzed by using a computer tool designed ad hoc .Results: There were signi ﬁcant differences between countries in the number of webpages that sold the products (Chi-square test, p<0.05).
Oxandrolone was available for purchase mainly when buying from Spain (27.12%) and Ukraine (26.58%), in websites dedicated to sports (77.26%). For DHEA, most of thepages offered it if the search was done from Canada (23.34%) and Russia(21.44%).Products containing androstenedione or DHEA are claimed toenhance sports performance or for sports use without providing details.Compared to the total number of websites checked, the proportion ofpharmacies offering these products was low, ranging from 4.86% for DHEA to15.79% for androstenedione.Conclusion: The three substances selected are easily available without control through the Internet.Only a small number of websites offering them were onlinepharmacies, and requested a prescription.Most of the doping substances arepurchased from the country where they are requested.Product information described bene ﬁts for sports performance, but did not do the same with their side effects.
It would be advisable for these products to be sold throughpharmacies, to guarantee their quality and provide evidence-based informationOPEN ACCESS EDITED BY Anna Serefko, Medical University of Lublin, Poland REVIEWED BY Massimiliano Esposito,Kore University of Enna, ItalyAndrzej Pokrywka,Medical University of Warsaw, Poland *CORRESPONDENCE Jesús Seco-Calvo, jesus.seco@unileon.es Ana M.

KEYWORDS androstenedione, athletes, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), doping substances, internet availability, internet sale, oxandrolone 1 Introduction The use of doping substances among athletes has increased in recent years ( Martínez-Sanz et al., 2017 ;Sellami et al., 2018 ; Wardenaar and Hoggervorst, 2022 ). Their use makes it possible to cover de ﬁciencies derived from ingestion, but also to optimize exercise performance and improve body composition and recovery processes ( Birzniece, 2015 ;Knapik et al., 2016 ;Savino et al., 2019 ; Sadek et al., 2022 ).The latter are essential in athletes due to the increased physical demands ( Stellingwerff, 2013 ).On the other hand, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) deﬁnes doping as: “the commission of one or more anti-doping rule violations as provided for in sections 1 –11 of Article 2 of the Code ” (Garthe and Maughan, 2018 ).
These sections mention the concept of prohibited substances, metabolites or markers that may be present in the athlete ’s sample. These substances are included in the Prohibited List of the World Anti-Doping Code.Therequirements to be incorporated into this category are toaccomplish two of three criteria: 1.it has the potential tooptimize performance; 2.it has an actual or potential risk to theathlete ’s health; 3.it violates the competitive spirit as expressed in the Code ( World Anti-Doping Agency, 2021 ).Steroid drugs commonly used as androgens and anabolic agents that increase endogenous testosterone levels are divided into3 groups: natural steroids, synthetic ones, and drugs that increaseendogenous testosterone (indirect doping).Their androgenic effectson athletic performance were con ﬁrmed from research, showing that testosterone increased muscle mass and strength.
The bene ﬁts were seen without exercise, with gains in muscle mass and strengthby 10%, and also with exercise, being the increases between 20% and 37% ( Bhasin et al., 1996 ). These compounds are also been used therapeutically to treat a variety of medical conditions.For this study, we have selected 3 substances that act as anabolic agents, two are natural steroids and testosterone precursors (pro-androgens), androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone(DHEA), and one is a synthetic steroid, oxandrolone.Naturalandrogen precursors like DHEA and androstenedione areconverted to testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or epitestosterone, and also used to mask the testosterone/ epitestosterone ratio ( Miller, 2020 ).Oxandrolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione are considered by WADA as doping substancesin sports.Speci ﬁcally, these substances are on the list of prohibitions that came into force in January 2023.
They are included in thesection of prohibited substances and methods at all times (in- andout-of-competition), in category S1 anabolic agents ( World Anti- Doping Agency, 2022b ). The clinical experience of some authors of this paper as sports physicians shows that oxandrolone, DHEA and androstenedione aresubstances in great demand within sports environment, particularly in sports where is necessary to develop strength and gain musclemass.Therefore, their use is common in sports such as weightlifting,bodybuilding and endurance sports.Anabolic-androgenic steroids(AAS) use is 11% among gym athletes, 39% among bodybuilders and67% among weightlifters ( Birzniece, 2015 ).Regarding oxandrolone, it is an anabolic steroid synthesized in 1962 ( Guddat et al., 2013 ).This drug is highly anabolic, and only a few androgenic effects are observed ( Kuhn, 2002 ;Guddat et al., 2013 ).
Its use is approved for the preservation of lean tissue in catabolic conditions, such as sarcopenia ( Mavros et al., 2015 ). It seems to be the most popular anabolic-androgenic agent amongwomen due to these weak androgenic effects ( Ip et al., 2010 ;La Vignera et al., 2018 ), and it is among the most commonly used AAS (Piacentino et al., 2015 ; Smit and de Ronde, 2018 ;Pereira et al., 2019 ; Whitaker et al., 2021 ;Escalante et al., 2023 ).In the case of DHEA, it is an androgen precursor, commonly used in premenopausal and postmenopausal women as hormonetherapy ( Rabijewski et al., 2020 ).In sports its use is justi ﬁed due to the effects on body composition, decrease in fat mass and increase inmuscle mass ( Collomp et al., 2015 ).DHEA has been aggressively marketed as it increases testosterone levels and muscle mass ( Brown et al., 2006 ).Androstenedione is a steroid hormone intermediate in the production of estrogen and testosterone.
Due to its relevance inthe intrinsic synthetic pathways of androgens, it is used amongathletes to achieve a change in body composition, whether it is adecrease in fat mass or an increase in muscle mass ( Tokish et al., 2004 ). On the other hand, the favorable anabolic effects of androstenedione are inconclusive ( Rasmussen et al., 2000 ;Brown et al., 2006 ), but the adverse effects such as reduced sperm count, impotence, and gynecomastia are conclusive ( Badawy et al., 2021 ).Regardless of the bene ﬁts reported in sports, the use of these doping substances carries health risks which involved all organs andbody functions, and especially long term, when causingcardiovascular and reproductive toxicity ( Labrie et al., 2006 ; Albano et al., 2021 ).There are still those who try and acquire these substances due to their androgenic effects, being unaware or disregarding their harmful effects.
In this sense, the Internet has become an important source for easy access to AAS worldwide(Cordaro et al., 2011 ), not always within the legal channels of purchase. It is also used as a major source of information, butsometimes websites are not entirely reliable or may even bemisleading and deceptive ( Brennan et al., 2016 ).In view of this, the aim of this study is to estimate the availability and accessible information on the Internet about the sale of these three doping substances, oxandrolone, DHEA and androstenedione, as well as to assess the labeling of the products containing each ofthese substances, reviewing their indications for use included in Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 02Garcia et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1305080 these labels.Secondarily we will estimate the offer of these compounds when buying from different countries, which wouldmean that there is greater tolerance to its sale depending on the Stateand its regulations.
It is known to the authors that there is no research on doping substances and their acquisition through Internet sites. In previous research, the analysis of doping substances is focused on the motivations for their consumption ( Petróczi, 2007 ;Morente- Sánchez and Zabala, 2013 ) and/or on the advice given by trainers (Zmuda Palka et al., 2023 ) or pharmacists ( Malek et al., 2014 ; Howard et al., 2018 ).Our hypothesis is that athletes can acquire these doping substances in certain countries without a (medical)prescription, and from websites that do not always come fromlaboratories.2 Material and methods 2.1 Design Cross-sectional study, being an observation at a point in time of the online availability of the three compounds selected that can be used as doping substances (oxandrolone, DHEA, and androstendione), and bought from six countries (Spain, PuertoRico, Canada, United States, Ukraine and Russia).
Thesecountries were selected for several reasons: some of them weremonitored by WADA in October 2022 (Russia, Ukraine, and PuertoRico) ( World Anti-Doping Agency, 2022a ); two other countries as they host the Compliance Review Committee (CRC) and theInternational Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness (IFBB) (Canada and Spain, respectively); and the United States of America, due to the number of athletes ( Barrack et al., 2020 ; USADA, 2023 ) and the annual revenue from the sale of sports supplements, with more than 1.4 billion in annual revenue ( Badawy et al., 2021 ). Thus, we decided to analyze these supplements because they may be frequently consumed by athletes, and their intake isoften associated with improvements in sports performance, either byincreasing muscle mass ( Jenkinson and Harbert, 2008 ), their effects on sex hormones ( Mason et al., 2001 ) or their anti-in ﬂammatory and antioxidant actions ( Cerqueira et al., 2020 ).
To carry out the searches, an “ad hoc ”software was used and programmed. By using the computer tool designed, it was simulatedto be a purchaser of these products from each of the countriesdescribed above.The results obtained in the different searches werereviewed and evaluated by pairs.Any potential disagreement wasresolved by all authors.The searches and data evaluation took 15 days (from 1st to 15th July 2023).The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement was used to report data(Cuschieri, 2019 ) and the checklist included in the Supplementary Material (see Appendix A).
2.2 Data obtained from the website pages analyzed The following characteristics of the websites found were assessed: number of pages that did not connect, number of pagesthat sold that compound, number of pages that sold any other of the compounds evaluated and which of them; type of page, that is, if itwas a speci ﬁc sports page, a supermarket, a pharmacy or a parapharmacy, if it was specialized in the sale of nutritionalsupplements, a laboratory, pages that sold any type of product,or any other type of page. In addition, it was checked whether they sold only within their own country, only to several countries or globally.For each of the three compounds studied, we also evaluatedthe pharmaceutical forms offered, e.g., whether they were for oral,parenteral or other routes of administration; what the product wasrecommended for; and whether any type of prescription wasrequired for purchase.
2.3 Search engine To gather all the information we needed from the Internet, we used our previous experience, adapting our software and maskingour global location using a VPN. We gathered seeds using a modi ﬁed version of our crawler and IMN Search Engine Extractor v32 ( García and Carriegos, 2020 ), adapted from our previous researches ( García et al., 2020 ;García et al., 2022 ), choosing Google as our search engine.Our crawler can automatically visit a list of prede ﬁned websites (the aforementioned seeds), extracting and (or) analyzing information they contain,which greatly eases the whole process (we do not have tomanually search for and visit sites), reducing fatigue andpropensity for human error.
The keywords used to obtain these seeds were “oxandrolone ”, “dehydroepiandrosterone ”,“DHEA ”, and “androstenedione ”, translated to the languages spoken in each of the regions we were interested in (Spanish, English, Russian, and Ukrainian).Our software takes the list of URLs to visit directly from thesearch engine ’s (that is, Google) result page (SERP). In this research, we found two major inconveniences to overcome: mandatory continuous scrolling SERP ’s con ﬁguration and (also mandatory) omitted related results.On the one hand, we found problems when working with Google regions in which continuous scroll search (a new feature from Google active since April 2023) was available (United States).
Results in thoseareas are loaded in batches, ten by ten, while the user scrolls down;when reaching one hundred results, the whole search results pagereloads, and the user must start scrolling again (the same results)although this time more results are offered (typically, around twohundred max). Even if the search engine can be set up so continuousscroll is deactivated, it does not work, and the option to set “maximum results per page ”is overridden by this setup (as stated by Google itself).All this makes search extremely costly to automate (we do notget all results in one click, we have to scroll for them to load), and wehad to rely on Selenium to do so, simulating the user scrolling down tothe bottom of the SERP until no more results were loaded.
On the other hand, SERP showing (initially omitted) related results is no longer an option, but an automatic action once last pageof results (or last batch of results - for continuous scrolling regions - and yes, this problem goes on top of the previously detailed one for that region) is loaded in the browser. In our experience, loadingrelated results is almost never useful (Afterall, Google itself hadomitted them for a reason): most (if not all) of them are duplicated, Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 03Garcia et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1305080 or pertain to the same domain of other results, and are thus irrelevant.
Showing related results arti ﬁcially boosts results offered by the engine from (usually) two to up to ﬁve times the number of original results, so a little bellow one hundred quicklybecomes several hundred; however, as expected, these results were highly undesired, and we did not ﬁnd aﬁx for this behavior (since it is on Google ’s side and now it is a compulsory functionality of the search engine), so we had to make additional scripts and softwarechanges to wait for them to load and then purge the results, limitingseeds to one by domain. As for the VPN to use, we checked several alternatives: ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark (all of them requiringpayment, although ExpressVPN has a free trial period), Tunnel Bear, Urban VPN, or Windscribe (offering a free subscription), justto name a few.Tunnel Bear is a decent and free VPN popular withinthe Internet community, especially in Reddit forums.It offersservers in 49 countries and comes with 500 MB/mo bandwidth.
It provides a wide server network, military-grade encryption, and a zero-log policy, making a decent free VPN. Windscribe is anotherinteresting alternative, offering higher bandwidth (10 GB/month)but fewer world servers (10 countries).ExpressVPN and NordVPNare more robust, limit-free, and reliable (major drawback with freeoptions is that they either sell your data or bloat you with adds - orboth) options, as long as you pay for the subscription.TABLE 1 Analysis of websites found in which oxandrolone may be acquired from the different countries.

3 Results Tables 1 ,2andTable 3 include the analysis of the websites found in which oxandrolone, DHEA, and a ndrostenedione, respectively, may be acquired from the different countries. After the search, the software designed for the study located a total of 2721 websitespotentially selling the compounds s elected, with similar values for each of the 3 products.Subsequently, the pages were reviewed andthose that either did not connect or did not sell the product wereeliminated (most of them were pages with information aboutthe product or pages of laboratories that made analyticaldeterminations of the compound).Finally, there were a total of 977 pages that did sell any of the compounds evaluated.A total of 860 websites were found for oxandrolone ( Table 1 ).The countries that most often offered the product for sale were Puerto Rico(24.07%) and Spain (22.09%).
However, once the websites that did notconnect or did not sell this compound (57.56% of the pages) wereeliminated, the countries with the highest number of pages availablefor purchase were Spain and Ukraine (27.12% and 26.85% of thewebsites selling oxandrolone, respectively). Statistical analysis revealedsigniﬁcant differences between countries (Chi-square test, p<0.05), but not between the following pairs: Puerto Rico and Canada; Spain and Russia; Puerto Rico and United States; United States and Russia.Regarding the type of site where oxandrolone could be purchased, themajority (77.26%) were sites dedicated to sports (sport stores or sitesspecialized solely in nutrition or sport pharmacology).Thispercentage was the highest when searching from Ukraine (92.86%)and the lowest from Canada (40.00%).TABLE 3 Analysis of websites found in which androstenedione may be acquired from the different countries.

a1.- Sport: increase muscle mass and strength; 2.- increase testosterone levels; 3.- research. Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 06Garcia et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1305080 Most of the sites sent the order only to their own country (60.82%).For web pages located from Russia and Ukraine thispercentage was much higher (80.00% and 95.92%, respectively) andthe lowest value corresponded to sites found from the United States(10.26%).Most webs from the United States served worldwide(84.62% of the sites).Only 3 sites in Canada and 5 in the United States asked for a prescription to be able to buy it.Practically all the products offered were for oral administration.A small number of webpages from Puerto Rico and Ukraine soldoxandrolone for parenteral administration and in Canada,United States and Ukraine, in the form of a powdered chemicalproduct.
As for oxandrolone indications, most websites (86.85%)recommended its use for sports, stating that it increased musclemass, strength, endurance and performance in sports. Oxandrolone could hardly purchase in pharmacies (only 5.20% of those webpages selling this compound), and 2.19% required a prescription.As mentioned above, Table 2 summarizes the data obtained for DHEA, for which a total of 935 pages were found.Most of them werelocated by simulating the search from Canada (28.13%) and Russia(18.40%).After reviewing these websites, we found that 59.36% ofthem sold the compound, and the countries from which the largestnumber of pages were available for purchase were also Canada and Russia (22.34% and 21.44% of the websites, respectively).
In this case, there were also signi ﬁcant differences between countries (Chi-square test,p<0.05), with similar proportions among the subgroups Spain, Puerto Rico and Canada; Spain, Puerto Rico and Ukraine; Puerto Ricoand Ukraine; United States and Russia. Of the total number ofwebsites offering DHEA, 29.73% were dedicated to the sale ofdietetic products and 23.96% to sports.However, if each countrywas evaluated independently, there were differences between them.In Spain, Puerto Rico and the United States, those dedicated to dietetic products predominated (51.22%, 38.00% and 70.00%), while in Russiaand Ukraine the majority of sites were dedicated to sports (54.72%and 55.71%, respectively) and in Canada they were mainlylaboratories (35.48%).There were speci ﬁc cases of other types of sites, such as aesthetic clinics or veterinary clinics.
As for where theorders were sent, most of the sites only sent them to their own country(68.83%), with the highest percentages, once again, corresponding to sites located in Russia (98.32%) and Ukraine (98.57%). Only 2 sites from Canada and 5 from the United States required a prescription topurchase it.Practically all the websites offering DHEA were for oraladministration, only 3 pages (1 from Puerto Rico, 1 fromUnited States and 1 from Ukraine) offered products for parenteraladministration and a small percentage (4.24%) sold formulations fortopical administration.The indications for this compound, asreported by the different web pages, were very varied, highlighting that it was useful for sports (45.95% of the web pages), for the improvement of disorders related to sexual hormones (32.61%)and as an anti-aging product (27.21%).In the different countriesevaluated, these indications were similar.
Again, the proportion ofpharmacies dispensing DHEA was low (4.86%), whereas aprescription was required in only 1.26% of websites. In the case of androstenedione ( Table 3 ), 926 pages were found, most of them when buying from Puerto Rico (24.30%) and Spain (23.76%), but only 57 of them offered this product for sale.In this case, the vast majority of the websites found by the software carried outanalytical determinations of this compound in biological samples.Thecountries from which there were more possibilities to acquire thisproduct were the United States and Canada (36.84% and 22.81% of those websites selling androstenedione, respectively).After carryingout the statistical analysis, there were signi ﬁcant differences between countries (Chi-square test, p<0.05), but not for the subgroups Canada and United States; Canada, Russia and Ukraine; Spain andPuerto Rico.A 4.64% of the webs also offered one of the other products.
This compound was mostly sold by pages belonging to laboratories (33.33%). In Puerto Rico and Russia, it was mainly offeredon pharmacy websites (66.67% and 40.00% of the sites, respectively).For this compound, most websites that sold it shipped worldwide(66.67%), except for those located in Russia and Ukraine, which onlyshipped it within their own country (80% and 100%, respectively).None of the websites selling androstenedione required a prescriptionto purchase it.Most of the products offered (57.90% of the websites) were the chemical compound itself in powder form (mainly Canadian and United States websites), and in the rest of the pages, it wasavailable for oral administration.None of the sites offered parenteralformulations.Androstenedione powder was intended for researchpurposes, and the rest of the products offered were recommended toincrease muscle mass and strength (29.82% of the sites) ortestosterone levels (26.32%).
The proportion of online pharmacieswhere this compound could be purchased was the highest of the three substances assessed (15.79%). In addition, none of the websites offering this product requested a prescription.4 Discussion In this study we have evaluated th e availability and accessible information on the internet about the sale of oxandrolone, DHEA and androstenedione.It was hypothesi zed that athletes can acquire these doping products on the internet f rom pages that do not always come from accredited pharmaceutical labor atories, as well as from countries that do not always require a prescription.The variables that wereanalyzed allowed us to know; 1.The availability of acquiring dopingsubstances in the same country or in other countries; 2.The type of web page; 3.The information with which these substances are marketed,e.g., administratio n forms and recommendations for their use.
The consumption of doping substances seeks to improve some of the four main dimensions of sports –skill, strength, endurance and recovery-. A substance or the combination of several substanceswill be consumed according to the dimension to be improved.In thecase of the doping substances under study, their consumption wouldbeneﬁt strength and sports where it predominates (e.g.,; lifting, throwing, boxing, sprinting).Thus, it can be considered a director indirect androgenic doping.In the ﬁrst case, natural androgens such as nandrolone or proandrogens (androstenedione, DHEA) would be found ( Handelsman, 2000 ).In the case of the substances tested, oxandrolone, a synthetic analog of testosterone, was mostly available on sports-orientedInternet sites, which shipped the order mainly in the countryitself.Only 8 out of 977 sites requested a prescription.
Its mainform of administration was oral and, to a lesser extent, as powder(Canada, United States and Ukraine) or parenteral forms (Puerto Rico and Ukraine). 77.26% of the sites marketing this product were dedicated to sports or for purposes such as sports nutrition andpharmacology.Regarding the information label, it is described asincreasing muscle mass, strength and endurance.Oxandrolone is Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 07Garcia et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1305080 used to preserve or restore muscle mass ( Bianchi and Marbini, 2015 ), often in the treatment of catabolic disorders such as Duchenne ’s dystrophy ( Fenichel et al., 2001 ), injuries associated with loss of muscle mass and strength ( Przkora et al., 2007 ; Mavros et al., 2015 ), improving strength ( Schroeder et al., 2003 ) and exercise tolerance ( Tamaki et al., 2001 ).
Therefore, the information provided with the product is not wrong; the explanation behind these bene ﬁts is the stimulating action on the protein synthesis of peripheral myelin. This is the reason becauseoxandrolone is used in demyelinating lesions and diseases ( Melcangi and Mensah-Nyagan, 2006 ).It should be noted that, in spite of these indications, the vast majority of webpages offering this compoundwere neither pharmacies (94.8%) nor did they require a prescription(97.8%), with the severe consequences that its consumption may have on the health of athletes, professional or amateur.As for DHEA, it is a product widely available on the Internet, having been found to be actually sold on 555 websites.These siteswere dedicated to the sale of dietary products (29.73%) or related tosports (23.96%).
In addition, they offered some of the other twosubstances, and their recommendations were diverse, mainly sportsuse (45.95%), bene ﬁts in disorders associated with sex hormones (32.61%) and anxiety (27.21%). Its administration was mainly oral, followed by parenteral and topical.Again, the number of pharmacies dispensing this product was low (4.9%), and only 7 websites requireda prescription (1.3%), which gives an idea on the ease of access to thissubstance without recognized professional advice and the harmfuleffects that this use may have for the consumers.Its inclusion in WADA ’s list of prohibited substances is due to performance enhancements as it increases testosterone ( Collomp et al., 2015 ;Collomp et al., 2018 ;Gravisse et al., 2019 ).DHEA administration is sometimes combined with testosterone and its precursors such as androstenedione ( Alkatib et al., 2009 ;de la Torre et al., 2019 ).
The results for androstenedione showed, on the one hand, that the possibility of acquiring this substance through the Internet is muchlower than for the other two compounds, and most webpages foundwere dedicated to determine this product in analytics. On the otherhand, the main countries where it was offered were United States and Canada.Particularly, in the United States, consumption of androstenedione has become popular since a baseball league playeradmitted to using it ( Badawy et al., 2021 ).Likewise, in the case of this doping substance, none of the Internet sites required a prescription.Itshould be noted that androstenedione is frequently prescribed insarcopenia in older adults for the purpose of improving quality of life(Brown et al., 2000 ).Since it is a precursor of testosterone, its consumption facilitates the increase of muscle mass as well as the performance in the training sessions ( Badawy et al., 2021 ).
It is sold as an anabolic agent ( Catlin et al., 2002 ) and used as a supplement for bodybuilding to improve performance ( Badawy et al., 2021 ). In the results, it was observed that recommendations for its consumption areassociated with enhancing muscle mass and strength (29.82%) orincreasing testosterone levels (26.32%).Androstenedione, unlikeoxandrolone, was mainly marketed in laboratories (33.33%) andpharmacies (66.67% in Puerto Rico and 40% in Russia).This compound was mainly offered as active ingredient (powder) (57.90%) and secondly for the oral route.As described before, AAS therapies are indicated in disorders associated with aging, cachex ia, cancer or osteoporosis ( Kanayamaet al., 2010 ).However, some athletes consume AAS to fraudulently achieve an increase in protein synthesis and thus in muscle mass andstrength, as well as reduce body fat ( Hengevoss et al., 2015 ).
High doses of AAS may lead to physical compli c a t i o n ss u c ha sh y p e r t e n s i o n , abnormal blood clotting, hepatotox icity and hepatic tumors, tendon damage, reduced libido, impaired g lucose tolerance, increased blood cholesterol and psychiatri c/behavioral symptoms ( Shephard et al., 1977;Finkelstein et al., 2013 ;Piacentino et al., 2015 ). Regarding mood disorders, hospitaliz ations for manic episodes ( Papazisis et al., 2007)a n ds u i c i d e s( Pärssinen et al., 2000 ) have been reported, both associated with long-term consump tion.When athletes choose to take them, they sometimes do so without medical supervision.Thissituation, coupled with the easy a ccess to these substances without a medical prescription through the Int ernet, and the scarce or distorted information provided by commerc ial websites, may aggravate the adverse reactions described above.
Regarding the status of the tested substances in the countries evaluated, it may change from one country to another, as acompound may be approved for use in one country and not inanother. Nevertheless, and although WADA includes these threesubstances in the list of prohibited substances for athletes at all times(in- and out-of competition) ( World Anti-Doping Agency, 2022b ), we have observed that recommendations of use are focused frequently on sport improvements.The six countries evaluated in this study are adhered to the WADA Convention against Doping in Sport, and comply withguidelines and the lists of prohibited substances established byWorld Anti-Doping Agency, 2022b .
However, in the case of Russia, the meetings held by WADA in September 2023 persist inthe analysis on the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) because, even after the deadline provided by WADA, the RUSADA agency does not comply with these conditions and remainson the Global List of Non-Compliant Signatories and ApplicableConsequences ( World Anti-Doping Agency, 2023 ). The problem underlying this supply and easy access to substances through the Internet is that people, athletes or not,are not always able to distinguish whether this consumption is legalor not.It would be simpler if they were only accessed through regular distribution channels of medicines like the pharmacies.If offered as medicines, these substances should require aprescription, given their stero idal nature, and certainly they should not be offered as supplements.
As for DHEA, althoughin many countries this steroid is under legal control, in theUnited States it is not included in the Controlled SubstancesAct, and it is also allowed in dietary supplements. Conversely,DHEA is listed as a controlled substance by Health Canada because of its effect on hormones, and n eed a prescription, and in the European Union it could also not be used as a supplement.In anycase, it should be noted that if athletes from all these countriesparticipate in international competitions, they have to comply withthe World Anti-Doping Code to avoid sanctions.Misinformation and the easy availability of these substances favor the increase in consumption.In the United States, 3.0% of youngpeople have used doping substances, speci ﬁcally anabolic-androgenic steroids ( Hildebrandt et al., 2012 ).
In addition, a 60% consumption of dietary supplements is reported by athletes ( Schröder et al., 2002 ; Schröder et al., 2004 ;Barrack et al., 2020 ), that may lead to inadvertent doping ( Helle et al., 2019 ;Mallick et al., 2023 ). Thus, another study Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 08Garcia et al.10.3389/fphar.2023.1305080 (Badawy et al., 2021 ) highlighted that the main source of information at the time of purchasing supplements came from friends or the mediaand, to a lesser extent, from professional advice.Also, in the case ofprofessional athletes, 28% of them had consulted a physiotherapistabout their use, but 18% acknowledged that they used supplementswithout seeking professional support ( Judge et al., 2016 ).There are studies ( Malek et al., 2014 ;Howard et al., 2018 ) showing that pharmacists were used as a source of information in the selectionand purchase of products less frequently than other informationproviders.
Thus, it would be important to harmonize the sale of these substances through pharmacies and not through these websites.Pharmacies are regular channels of distribution of medicines, so thatit would be possible to control their sale only when they are therapeutically needed. At the same time, pharmacies may provide evidence-based information on their use and the bene ﬁts and risks associated.On the other hand, it is possible that theseproducts offered through the Internet are falsi ﬁed medical ones, possibility that would be eliminated if they were dispensed onlythrough pharmacies.Several studies have highlighted the need for better communication on health risks of purchasing substances online, as well as the need to establish sales control procedures ( Ventola, 2014 ;Long et al., 2022 ;Qutob et al., 2023 ).
National and international public health authorities and regulatory agenciesshould direct their efforts to clearly regulate the sale of thesubstances evaluated in this study (and others in the samesituation) exclusively for the therapeutic use for which they areindicated, as well as harmonize the sale of dietary supplements. Onthe other hand, control measures for the sale of doping substances through the Internet should be established, with cybersecurity measures that help to monitor and control this market.Moreover, emphasis should be placed on ergonutritional education on which supplements are allowed, but also on theproper way to select them, e.g., brands, modes of administration,timing of ingestion ( Malek et al., 2014 ).The risks of their consumption do not only extend to a sanction by WADA, butalso to adverse health effects ( Badawy et al., 2021 ).These facts highlight the importance of professional advice before the consumption of these substances.
4.1 Limitations and future perspectives This study is not without limitations. The websites described were located at a point in time, so these data should be updated on a regular basis as online offer is constantly changing.Additionally, some websites can disappear and new ones mayappear.This study serves as a backbone for future research relatedto the proposed topic, including more prohibited substances fromthe same category.5 Conclusion From this study it is concluded that these substances are easily available without control on the Internet, with only alimited number of sites offering oxandrolone, DHEA and androstenedione requesting a prescription.Particularly in thecase of androstenedione, none of the websites requested aprescription.Products ’information for its consumption refer to performance bene ﬁts and increases in muscle mass, strength and endurance, but they do not do the same for their side effects.
Only a small number of websites selling these products were online pharmacies. It would be important for these products to be soldthrough pharmacies, as it would guarantee their quality and, inaddition, provide evidence-based information on their safe use,beneﬁts and risks.It has been found that, despite regulatory measures, websites are available in the countries evaluated topurchase these substances without a prescription.Most of theweb pages offering these compounds only sell them in their own country, but it is possible to purchase them in some sites that send to other countries.6 Practical applications It should be considered that beyond the implications of their consumption in sport, they have clear detrimental effects (e.g., cardiovascular, hormonal imbalances).Athletes should be encouraged to consult health professionals (pharmacists, sportphysicians and/or nutritionists) about which supplements aresuitable for their type of training and sport objectives.
