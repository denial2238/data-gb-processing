Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci.2024;65(1):26. https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.65.1.26PURPOSE.Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is a gaze-holding disorder characterized by conjugate, uncontrolled eye oscillations that can result in significant visual acuity loss.INS is often associated with albinism, but the mechanism is unclear.Albino mice have nystagmus; however, a pigmented mouse with a tyrmutation making it phenotypically albino, the B6(CG)-Tyr(c-2J)/J (B6 albino), had not been tested.We tested optokinetic response (OKR) in B6 albino and control mice.RNA-Seq was performed on extraocular muscles (EOM), tibialis anterior (TA) muscle, abducens (CN6), and oculomotor (CN3) neurons to uncover molecular differences that may contribute to nystagmus.METHODS.OKR was measured using an ISCAN system.RNA was isolated from four tissues to identify differentially expressed genes and validated with qPCR and immunohisto- chemistry.Ingenuity pathway analyses identified top biological pathways.
RESULTS.All B6 albino mice tested had nystagmus. Differential RNA expression analysis showed 383 genes differentially expressed in EOM, 70 in CN3, 20 in CN6, and 639 in the TA.Twogenesweredifferentiallyexpressedinallfourtissues: wdfy1andnnt.Differences were validated by qPCR and immunostaining.CONCLUSIONS .The tyrmutation in B6 albino mice, genotypically pigmented and pheno- typically albino, is sufficient to result in spontaneous nystagmus.The two genes with decreased expression in the B6 albino tissues examined, w dfy1and nnt, have been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction and stem cell maintenance in other systems.Their function in extraocular muscle is unknown.These studies suggest that this mouse model of nystagmus may allow molecular identification of candidate nystagmus-related genes.
Keywords: extraocular muscles, nystagmus, RNA-seq, gene expression, albinism Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is a gaze holding disorder characterized by uncontrollable oscillations of the eyes. In the case of INS, patients will present with these oscillations before the age of 6 months.1A large number of cases of INS are idiopathic and have no known cause associated with the disorder.INS is commonly associated with sensory afferent defects, such as optic nerve hypopla- sia or albinism.2There are a number of genetic mutations that cause albinism in humans, and many of these individ- uals also have infantile nystagmus.
Generally the oscillation frequency of these human individuals with nystagmus varies between 0.5 to 8 hertz.3Mutations have been described in the following genes, and they all result in hypopigmenta- tion of the eyes: OCA1/2/3/4, TYR, TYRP1, and MATP.4The prevalence of albinism and infantile nystagmus together is roughly 2.5 per 10,000 in humans.1 Albino mice are an excellent animal model for the study of infantile nystagmus.5Traber et al.5measured optokinetic reflexes (OKR) in the dark and in the presence of an optoki- netic stimulus. They showed that in albino (BALB/C and CD1) and in hypo-pigmented mice (DBA1), spontaneouseye movements were seen in the dark, and all showed nystagmus-likewaveformsinthepresenceoftheoptokinetic stimulus.5C57BL/6 mice had normal OKR in the presence of the optokinetic stimulus.
A developed mouse strain, B6(CG)-Tyr(c-2J)/J that we refer to as B6 albino, is genetically identical to a C57BL/6 mouse, but with a mutation in the tyrosinase gene, tyr, making this mouse phenotypically albino. This mouse has pigment completely absent from skin, hair, and eyes and does not have the genetic variances that other albino strains have compared to the pigmented C57BL/6 mouse, making it an excellent candidate to use as a nystagmus model.6The extraocular muscles (EOM) and the eye movements of this mouse were not previously studied.Eye movements are studied using eye tracking systems in humans as well as animal models.Specifically, we can examine the OKR waveforms in both humans and animal models.The OKR consists of tracking the movements of the eyes in response to a stimulus of moving black and white bars in the horizontal or vertical plane.
The eyes move in a very stereotypical manner, because this is a reflex, and Copyright 2024 The Authors iovs.arvojournals.org| ISSN: 1552-5783 1 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License. Albinism, Nystagmus, and Extraocular Muscles IOVS | January 2024 | Vol.65 | No.1 | Article 26 | 2 reproducible movements of the eyes can be tracked using video cameras focused on the eyes.In mice, recording of OKR movements requires that the head be stabilized and using a video camera, we can record eye movements in the presence or absence of the stimulus that produces the OKR.We hypothesize that the B6 albinos will have eye move- ment waveforms consistent with INS,as compared to control C57BL/6 mice, which will have normal eye movements.
We further hypothesize that an analysis of the transcriptome of the EOM and blocks of oculomotor (CN3) and abducens motor neurons (CN6) from each mouse genotype could illu- minate genes differentially expressed between the B6 albino mice in the absence of the stimulus that produces the OKR and the control pigmented mice that might be related to the onset or maintenance of these abnormal eye move- ments. Tibialis anterior (TA) muscles provided us with a way to eliminate nerve- and muscle-specific genes that were not related to eye movements.These analyses generated a number of candidate molecules and pathways that may be involved in some cases of idiopathic INS in humans.METHODS Animals C57BL/6 and B6(Cg)- Tyrc-2J/J (B6 albino) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and housed with Resource Animal Resources at the Univer- sity of Minnesota with 12 hour light/dark cycle and food ad libitum.
All animal studies followed the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, and all experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Minnesota. OKR Testing OKR was assessed as described previously.7In preparation for measurement of OKR, head posts were implanted to stabilize the head during testing.After a sterile incision was made into the scalp, the skull was cleaned, and head-posts were implanted by first inserting 000 ×3/32” self-tapping screws into the mouse skull on the top of the head.Geri- store dental cement (DenMat LLC, Lompoc, CA, USA) was placed on top of the screws and surrounding skull area to create a cap in which to insert the head-posts.
M3 ×0.5 mm nylon pan head slotted screws, with the screw heads removed, were placed vertically into the Geristore cement before it dried; this created posts on the mouse head for stabilization during pupil tracking experiments. Mice were allowed to recover from surgery for two weeks before test- ing.OKR traces were performed on a total of 18 C57BL/6 mice and 31 B6 albino mice.Once mice recovered from head-post surgery, and before testing began, they were placed in a dark room for at least 12 hours to acclimate to the dark.A number of previous studies had been unable to record eye movements in albino mice of various strains (CD18;B A L B / c9;D B A 29,10), despite the presence of normal structure and function of the retina itself.9The retinas of these mice appeared to be normal.Photophobia is present in these mice8; thus it is not surpris- ing that dark adaptation allows for eye movements to be recorded when using OKR.The ISCAN program (ISCAN,Inc.
Woburn, MA) used for tracking eyes cannot distinguish an albino mouse’s pupil; therefore, if a mouse was albino, a small temporary tattoo was placed on the mouse’s cornea torepresent the pupil for detection by the program. This was previously shown to be an accurate alternative to pupil tracking.11The C57BL/6 mice used as controls had their pupil detected by the program without a tattoo.The tattoo was created using a mixture of iron oxide and H 2O, then placed onto the eye lateral to the pupil using a blunted needle.No signs of corneal edema occurred in any of these albino mice.Normal eye blinks remove the tattoo after about 45 minutes.After the tattoo was placed, the mouse’seyemovementswererecordedwhilestillinthedark room,immobilized using a clamp attached to the head-posts and a tube around their bodies.During testing, the mice were surrounded by a white circular drum with black bars projected onto the white background.
The stimulus veloc- ity was 0.5 cycles/second for all testing, and horizontal and vertical eye movements were recorded. Each mouse was testing using a series of optokinetic stimuli with Michel- son contrasts of 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, and 400 and a series of optokinetic stimuli at 0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12, and 0.15 cycles/deg.After a period of rest, pupil tracking was performed in the absence of the optokinetic stimulus.These series were not randomized, so that each mouse followed the same pattern of contrast variations and differing spatial frequencies.Graphs were generated of the full 86 seconds and then processed further to show 20 second segments of each trace to remove tracings where there were a lot of eye blinks or loss of ability to track the tattoo by the video camera momentarily.
The black bars moved left to right across the mouse’s vision field with the above delin- eated sequences of spatial frequencies and varying contrasts for a total of 86 seconds, and eye movements tracking these rotating bars were recorded using a camera and the ISCAN program.TheISCANprogrammeasureshorizontalandverti- cal components of the movements of the mouse’s pupil or eye tattoo (named the pupil trace), and using a corneal reflection created by a red light near the camera aimed on the mouse eye. Calibration for each mouse was done prior to recording eye movements using both no stimuli and stimuli in the ISCAN program to set the detection of the pupil or eye tattoo and the corneal reflection.
To analyze the data from the ISCAN program, raw files of horizontal and vertical movement components were uploaded into a custom program in R (R Foundation for Statistical Comput- ing, Vienna, Austria), where the raw pupil trace was filtered by subtracting the raw corneal reflection trace to remove extra head movements. The average horizontal and verti- cal positions were calculated for each trace, with each set arbitrarily at zero and −20, respectively, for ease of graphic representation.OKR responses were characterized based on published waveform analyses.12 RNA-Seq RNA was isolated from the following tissues: EOM, TA, a block containing abducens cranial motor neurons (CN6), and a block containing the oculomotor cranial motor neurons (CN3) from four mice per genotype.An RNA- Seq dataset was compiled using tissue obtained from four C57BL/6 and four B6 albino mice.
The EOM, the TA, a block containing the CN6 neurons and a block contain- ing the CN3 neurons were dissected from each mouse. EOM, TA, CN6, and CN3 tissues were prepared for RNA- Seq using either the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) or RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen).After isolation, RNA was assessed for quality using RNA Integrity Number score as assayed Albinism, Nystagmus, and Extraocular Muscles IOVS | January 2024 | Vol.65 | No.1 | Article 26 | 3 using an Agilent 2100 Analyzer.The cutoff point for the RNA Integrity Number score was 8.These analyses were performed by University of Minnesota Genomic Core facil-ity.RNA-Seq was performed by the University of Minnesota Genomics Center,and all samples were run on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) instrument.The Universityof Minnesota Informatics Institute analyzed the RNA Seq output.
2 ×150bp FastQ paired-end reads for 32 samples (n =22.3 million average per sample) were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v 0.33) enabled with the optional “-q”option;3bp sliding-window trimming from 3 ʹend requiring mini- mum Q30. Quality control on raw sequence data for each sample was performed with FastQC.Read mapping was performed via Hisat2 (v2.1.0) using the mouse genome (mm10) as a reference.Gene quantification was done via Feature Countsfor raw read counts.Differentially expressed genes were identified using the edgeR (negative binomial) feature in CLCGWB (Qiagen) using raw read counts.Genes were qualified as differentially expressed in the varying tissue types (EOM, TA, CN3, and CN6) between the B6 albino mice and the C57BL/6 mice by havinga minimum 2x Absolute Fold Change and a correctedPvalue<0.05.
Principalcomponentanalysis (PCA)plotswere generated along with a heat map comparing the different samples fromall the tissue types in the B6 albino mice and the C57BL/6 mice to visually validate the RNA-Seq data. Gene plots on log2 transformed CPM values were generated for visualiz-ing different RNA levels of the two genes between the B6 albino mice and the C57BL/6 mice for each tissue.Venny 13 tools were used to numerically visualize genes differentially expressed in multiple tissues.Differentially expressed gene datasets were uploaded into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Qiagen) for path-way and functional analysis.Pathways for the EOM and TA were analyzed by IPA groups: cellular growth, prolifera- tion and development, and organismal growth and develop-ment.
Each tissue type was also analyzed for physiologicalsystem development and function through IPA.Graphs were displayed using −log ( Pvalue), with the threshold set at P value =0.05.AlldataaredepositedinGEOandcanbefound using this accession number: acc =GSE245207. Gene Validation Genes that were found differentially expressed were vali- dated or confirmed using qPCR.The EOM, the TA, a block containing the CN6 neurons and a block containing the CN3 neurons were dissected from each mouse.These tissueswere prepped using Qiagen Tissue Ruptor, and then RNA was isolated using either the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) or RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen).cDNA was constructed from the isolated RNA using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, Basel Switzerland).Primers were designed using PrimerBLAST(NCBI) and synthesized by IDT (Integrated DNA Technolo- gies, Coralville, IA, USA).
Samples were prepped for qPCR using Fast Start Essential DNA Green Master (Roche) andrun on a LightCycler 96 System (Roche). Immunohistochemistry Adult B6 albino and control mice (N =4 per genotype) were euthanized with an overdose of carbon dioxide using a tank system.The eyes with all rectus muscles attachedwere removed, embedded in tragacanth gum, and frozen in 2-methylbutane on liquid nitrogen, sectioned at 12 μm, and placed in a −30°C freezer for storage.For immunostaining, cryosections were rinsed in PBS,and blocked with 20% goat serum containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin in antibody buffer (PBS containing 0.2% Triton-X-100) for 30 minutes.This was followed by incubation with a rabbit antibody to WDFY1 (1:50 in antibody buffer; cat.LS-B12648; LifeS- pan Biosciences, Shirley, MA, USA) for one hour at roomtemperature.
After a rinse in PBS, the sections were blockedwith 20% goat serum containing 0.2% bovine serum albu- min in antibody buffer (PBS containing 0.2% Triton-X-100) for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with goat-anti-rabbitIgG AF488 (1:100, cat. 111-545-144; Jackson ImmunoRe- search, West Grove, PA, USA) for 30 minutes.This process was repeated with incubation in a mouse primary antibodyagainst embryonic (1:20, BF-45; Developmental Hybridoma Bank, Ames, IA, USA) or type IIX myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform (1:20, BF-35; Developmental HybridomaBank) for one hour at room temperature followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse IgG DyLight 405 anti- body (1:100, cat.115-475-146; Jackson ImmunoResearch)for 30 minutes.
After a PBS rinse, the slides were cover-slipped using Vectashield antifade mounting medium (H- 1700;VectorLaboratories,Burlingame,CA,USA).Slideswere photographed using a Leica DM4000B fluorescence micro-scope(Leica,Wetzlar,Germany).Numbersofmyofibersposi- tive for a specific protein were analyzed and presented as a percent of total fibers. Four sections from four mice ofeach genotype were used for WDFY1 and IIA MyHC isoform coexpression analysis.A minimum of 200 myofibers were countedin each section forthe EOM,ineach layer,andthesewere averaged for each mouse.Significant differences were determinedusingGraphPadPrism10.0software(GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA) using unpaired t-tests, where P<0.05.F-tests were run to determine normal variance on the data.RESULTS Effects of the Tyr Mutation on EOM Function Extraocular muscle function was tested using the OKR.In the pigmented C57BL/6 mice for all ages tested, the OKRwere normal ( Figs.1A,1B).
In the absence of stimuli, the eyes were relatively motionless in the C57BL/6 mice except for an occasional saccade ( Fig. 1A).In the same pigmented mice, the presence of the OKR stimulus across the mouse’sfield of vision resulted in normal slow and fast phase responses characteristic of normal OKR ( Fig.1B).In the unpigmented B6 albino mice, abnormal sponta- neous eye movements were present in the absence of visual stimuli (Figs.1C,1E,1G,1I).Some of these mice had pendu- lar waveforms ( Figs.1E,1G), whereas others showed jerk nystagmus ( Fig.1I) or reverse slow and fast phase move- ments (Fig.1C).In the presence of the OKR stimuli, the unpigmented B6 albino mice had abnormal and erratic eyemovements that resembled the spontaneous eye movementsin the absence of the OKR stimulus seen in human individ- uals with albinism and nystagmus ( Figs.1D,1F,1H,1J).14 Most of these erratic and oscillatory eye movements were pendularwaveforms,withoccasionaljerks( Figs.1D,1F,1H).
Although there were a small number of similarities between the B6 albino mouse eye oscillations during no stimuli andstimulitesting( Figs.1E,1F),allshowedabnormalanderratic eye oscillations frequencies that ranged between 0.2 to 1 Hz.

PCA plots were used to reduce the dimen- FIGURE3.Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes between the C57BL/6 and B6 albino mice in each tissue type.

This is most likely due to the EOM being developmentally and morphologically differ- ent from other limb or skeletal muscles such as the TA. Next, a heat map using sample-to-sample distances of all 32 samples showed similarities across samples in relation to each other ( Fig.2B).The heat map showed that the cranial motor neurons had very similar gene expression profiles to each other.The EOM and TA had similar profiles to each other, but less so than the gene expression profiles of the two groups of cranial motor neurons.When looking at the differentially expressed genes between the C57BL/6 and the B6 albino mice, there were a total of 383 genes differentially expressed in the EOM, 70 in the CN3 neurons, 20 in the CN6 neurons, and 639 in the TA (Supplemental Table S1).The TA allowed us to elimi- nate genes under the assumption that they would not be involved in eye movement function.
The number of over- lapping genes differentially expressed between each tissue was plotted using Venny8(Fig. 3).When examined based on comparisons within tissue types, there were 286 differ- entially expressed genes in only the EOM between geno- types, 49 only in the CN3 neurons, seven only in the CN6 neurons, and 541 only in the TA (Supplemental Table S2).Ninety-one genes differentially expressed in both the EOM and TA, 11 genes differentially expressed in CN3 and CN6, four genes in both the TA and CN3, three genes in both the EOM and CN3, and one gene in the TA, EOM, and CN3 (Supplemental Table S3).There are two genes that are differentially expressed in each of the four tissue types between the C57BL/6 and the B6 albino mice, nntandwdfy.Both were downregulated in the B6 albino compared to the Albinism, Nystagmus, and Extraocular Muscles IOVS | January 2024 | Vol.65 | No.

All four of the tissue types had both nntand wdfy1down-regulated in the B6 albino compared to the C57BL/6. PCR Validation of the Identified Differentially Expressed Genes The differential expression of these two genes was vali- dated using qPCR, which confirmed that both the wdfy1 and the nntgenes were significantly down-regulated in the B6 albino compared to the C57BL/6 in both the EOM and the TA, with decreases of 85.7% for EOM ( P=0.0032) and 86.5% for TA ( P=0.0001) ( Figs.5A,5B).The nntgenes were significantly down-regulated in both the B6 albino EOM and TA compared to the C57BL/6, with decreases of 88.5% ( P= 0.035) and 88.3% ( P=0.0001), respectively ( Figs.

We examined the EOM for coexpression with embryonic MyHC, and immunostaining wascoexpressedwiththisisoform( Fig.6).Therewasa100% overlap between myofibers positive for embryonic MyHC isoform and WDFY1.Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Differentially expressed genes were analyzed for significant differences in pathways and functions between the C57BL/6 and B6 albino mouse tissues ( Fig.7).Other differences between the EOM of each genotype and for both EOM and Albinism, Nystagmus, and Extraocular Muscles IOVS | January 2024 | Vol.65 | No.

Asterisk indicates significant difference from wt controls of the same tissue.TA include axonal guidance signaling and neuromuscular junction formation.The top physiological and disease related pathways were examined between the C57BL/6 and the B6 albinos and a large number of significant differences were seen in simi- lar pathways for all tissues examined ( Figs.8,9).These include those specifically associated with muscle: cardio- vascular system development and function and skeletal and muscular system development and function, and include genes such as dystrophin, IGF1, and serpine1.Additionally in the EOM, there are significant decreases in MyHC for fast 2X and 2B fibers in the B6 albino muscles (data not shown).
Differences in expression of fast IIA myofibers were further demonstrated using immunohistochemistry ( Fig. 10).There were significantly fewer WDFY1-positive myofibers in the EOM from the B6 albino mice ( Figs.10G,10H), with 42.8% fewer WDFY1-positive fibers in the B6 albino EOM ( P= 0.0003).In addition, there were 72.2% fewer double posi- tive fibers in the B6 albino EOM ( P=0.0003) compared to the WT controls.
DISCUSSION Mice with a mutation in the tyrosinase gene, the B6(CG)- Tyr(c-2J)/J (B6 albino) mouse, which is otherwise identicalgenetically to a C57BL/6 mouse, all exhibited waveforms consistent with nystagmus—defined as uncontrolled oscil- latory movements of the eyes both in the absence of stimu- lation and in the presence of the horizontally moving black and white bars used to test OKR.14A previous study exam- ined a number of albino mouse strains, CD1, BALB/c and DBA/1, and using OKR eye tracking showed nystagmus phenotypes compared to pigmented controls.5Thus we had hypothesized that, despite the C57BL/6 background, the B6 albino mice would have nystagmus. Although Traber et al.5 did not explicitly state the mice were dark adapted, they do say they did all their testing in a dark room.In the B6 albino mice, to demonstrate a response with the OKR stim- ulus, they had to be dark adapted.
Other studies examin- ing the OKR in albino mice that were not dark adapted have reported the absence of eye movements in the pres- ence of stimulation in CD18,B A L B / c9,a n dD B A 29,10albino mice, despite the presence of normal structure and function of the retina itself.9Based on the presence of uncontrolled oscillatory movements, we performed a transcriptome anal- ysis between these two mouse strains with only one genetic mutation between the two genotypes. Typically,the cause of nystagmus is described as a distur- bance in the central nervous system oculomotor control pathways.15,16Changes to the visual pathway such as foveal Albinism, Nystagmus, and Extraocular Muscles IOVS | January 2024 | Vol.65 | No.1 | Article 26 | 8 FIGURE6.Immunofluorescent staining of ( A–C) B6 albino extraocular muscle and ( D–F) control (WT) extraocular muscle for (A,C,D,F)W D F Y 1( green)a n d(B,C,E,F) embryonic myosin heavy chain isoform.

hypoplasia, optic nerve hypoplasia, and achiasma are all associated with nystagmus, along with albinism.4Oculocu- taneous albinism is characterized by a lack of pigment in the eyes, skin, and hair due to a disruption in the produc- tionofmelanin.Thisdisruptionintheproductionofmelanin can come from multiple genes, including OCA1/2/3/4, TYR, TYRP1,and MATP.3Tosimplifythisstudyweusedthetyrosi- nase gene, tyr, and a mouse with a mutation solely in this gene (JAX stock no. 000058)6to produce a phenotypically albino mouse on a normal C57BL/6 mouse background.The normal C57BL/6 mouse without the tyrmutation is pheno- typically pigmented and has normal eye movements during OKR.The B6 albino mice had waveforms typical of nystag- mus,both in the dark and in the presence of the OKR stimu- lus.
It should also be noted that the variability in waveforms is often seen in children with nystagmus,14and generally there is not a clear relationship between waveform charac- teristics and specific clinical conditions. Transcriptome analysis of this mouse strain compared to the control mice through RNA-Seq showed quality data across all of the tissue types (EOM,TA,CN3,and CN6).Typi- cally, when looking at quality RNA-Seq experiments, a PCAplotoraheatmapshowinghowallofthesamplesaresimilar to each other through distance matrices will show clusters by similar samples.In this study’s case there is clustering of samples by tissue type with respect to muscle compared to cranial neurons as the main principal component, then a second principal component making the muscle cluster break into EOM compared to TA but not breaking up the cranial motor neuron cluster.
We hypothesize that this tight clustering of the RNA expression patterns in the cranial motor neurons compared to the muscles is due to the EOM being developmentally different than other limb and skele- tal muscles of the body,17–19such as the TA muscle, whereas the motor neurons innervating the EOM are more similar to each other molecularly. RNA-Seq data used to analyze the transcriptome of the EOM, the TA, the cranial oculomotor neuronal pool, and the abducens motor neuronal pool in the C57BL/6 mouse and the B6 albino mouse revealed multiple differentially expressed genes overlapping between each tissue.These genes can be used for further studies on their potential role in nystagmus.Two genes, wdfy1and nnt,w e r ed i f f e r e n - tially expressed in all four tissue types between the C57BL/6 Albinism, Nystagmus, and Extraocular Muscles IOVS | January 2024 | Vol.65 | No.1 | Article 26 | 11 mice and the B6 albino mice.
Wdfy1codes for a protein localized to early endosomes after forming a complex that recognizes damaged lysosomes.20,21Nntcodes for nicoti- namide nucleotide transhydrogenase, an integral protein for proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane22and has been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction23and in maintenance of stem cells in other systems.24,25However, the role and function of wdfy1and nntin the EOM or nystagmus has not been studied previ- ously. The decrease in gene expression between the B6 albino to the C57BL/6 for both of these genes, wdfy1and nnt, was confirmed using qPCR and immunochemistry.Nystagmus in humans is routinely associated with central nervous system oculomotor control pathway abnormalities.Pathway analysis using IPA for the EOM and TA revealed differences between the C57BL/6 and the B6 albino mice in axonal guidance signaling.
Differences in physiological and system development between the C57BL/6 and B6 albino mice in the CN3 and CN6 include pathways in both skele- tal and muscular system development and function. These differences suggest adaptations that resulted in changes in axonal guidance in the development of the CN3 and CN6 nerves, as well as the muscles they innervate.The genes associated with these adaptations may provide poten- tial candidates for manipulation with the hope of altering nystagmus at the genetic or pathway level.Furthermore, there were 11 genes differentially expressed in the CN3 and CN6, 3 genes differentially expressed in both the EOM and CN3.286 genes were differentially expressed only in the EOM, 7 only in CN6, and 49 only in CN3.The genes that are differentially expressed in the tissues associated with the EOM, CN3 and CN6, could show important RNA level differences between the C57BL/6 mice and the B6 albino mice with respect to nystagmus.
Changes in percent of myofibers expressing the fast myosin heavy chain isoforms would have a significant effect on muscle shortening velocity.26It should be noted that these differences are likely to be compensatory to the primary cause of the nystagmus, although it has been shown that innervational differences in adult albino mice27are present before eye opening.28 Differentially expressed genes were analyzed for signif- icant differences in pathways and functions between the C57BL/6 and B6 albino mouse tissues. For example, in the EOM, pathway analysis showed significant downregu- lation of the HOTAIR regulatory pathway.HOTAIR is a long noncoding RNA that plays a role in myogenic cell prolif- eration, and decreases can result in decreased prolifera- tion.29,30Other differences between the EOM of each geno- type and for both EOM and TA include axonal guidance signaling.
This included decreases in the B6 albino tissues of molecules known to be expressed in muscle, synapses, and axon pathfinding to include the ephrin receptor A3, semaphorin 3A, D, and E, the MET receptor, and IGF1. Because we have previously demonstrated decreased axon density and neuromuscular junction size in human EOM from individuals with albinism,this suggests possible down- stream molecules that might be amenable for focusing new therapeutic approaches.In summary, we have demonstrated that the tyrgene mutation is sufficient in this mouse model to result in nystagmus.RNA-seq analysis of the EOM, and cranial motor neurons from oculomotor and abducens nuclei identified two genes whose expression was significantly decreased in all these tissues from the B6 albino mice: wdfy1and nnt.Their potential role in the etiology and/or maintenance of nystagmus is the subject of ongoing investigation.These genes implicate a potential mitochondrial basis for some forms of INS.
Other genes identified in these studies may also play a compensatory role in maintaining nystagmus and thus have potential for the modification of nystagmus.
