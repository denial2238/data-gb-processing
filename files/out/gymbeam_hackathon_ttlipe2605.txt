Email: salajeghehk@gmail.comAbstract The COVID- 19 pandemic has emerged as a major global health crisis. Vitamin D, a crucial fat- soluble vitamin, has been recommended for COVID- 19 patients, though evidence of its effectiveness is inconsistent.This systematic literature review and meta- analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on COVID- 19- related outcomes.A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases.Primary outcomes in- cluded mortality and hospital length of stay, while secondary outcomes encom- passed C- reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D- dimer, hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations, and lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts.Data analysis was performed using Stata™ Version 14.A total of 16 trials were analyzed.
The meta- analysis revealed that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced hospital length of stay (mean dif- ference = −1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: −2.23, −0.09; p = .033) with significant heterogeneity ( I2 = 69.2%, p = .002). Subgroup analysis showed a more pronounced reduction in studies with vitamin D dosages ≤10 000 international units (IU) (mean dif- ference = −1.27; 95% CI: −1.96, −0.57; p < .001) and in patients over 60 years old (mean difference = −1.84; 95% CI: −2.53, −1.14; p < .001).Additionally, vitamin D significantly reduced CRP concentrations in older adults (>60 years) (mean difference = −1.13; 95% CI: −2.07, −0.18; p = .019).No significant changes were found in ferritin, D- dimer, Hb concentrations, or in lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts (p > .05).In conclu- sion, while vitamin D supplementation did not significantly affect most COVID- 19- related biomarkers, however, it reduces the length of hospital stay.

1 | INTRODUCTION The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) epidemic, which began in China in late 2019, quickly spread worldwide, infecting millions and causing numerous deaths.1–3 According to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) as of June 2023, over 767 million COVID- 19 cases have been confirmed, with approximately 7 million fatalities.4 Since the outbreak began, extensive investigations have ex- plored the effects of pharmacological interventions, herbal remedies, traditional medicine, and other factors in managing COVID- 19.5–8 Nutritional factors are recognized as important in the pre- vention and treatment of COVID- 19.9,10 Various researchers have focused on nutritional factors that can strengthen the immune sys- tem against COVID- 19 or support the treatment process, leading to numerous studies in this area.11,12 Most of these studies have fo- cused on antioxidant compounds or diets designed to increase the intake of antioxidants and immune system- enhancing nutrients.13 Vitamin D, a key modulator of the immune system, plays a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immunity.14,15 Since the outbreak of COVID- 19, vitamin D has been extensively studied and is considered one of the most crucial nutrients.16 Vitamin D insufficiency has been associated with worse outcomes, greater severity, and a higher inci- dence of comorbidities in respiratory infections.17 Serum concentra- tions of 25- hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] <20 ng/mL have been shown to increase the risk of pneumonia by over 60%.18 There is an inverse correlation between 25(OH)D concentrations and both the severity of the disease and specific clinical biomarkers in COVID- 19 patients.19–21 Vitamin D may also mitigate the negative effects of COVID- 19 by regulating the renin- angiotensin system and the production of angiotensin- converting enzyme 2, which helps reduce lung leakage in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) animal models.22 Several clinical trials have evaluated the effects of different doses of vitamin D on COVID- 19 outcomes, but the results have been con- tradictory.23,24 To our knowledge, two recent meta- analyses have examined the effects of vitamin D supplementation in COVID- 19 pa- tients.25,26 However, these studies faced issues such as incomplete inclusion of primary articles, inclusion of retracted articles, and meth- odological limitations.
Additionally, the factors investigated differed from those examined in the current study. Therefore, this systematic review and meta- analysis aimed to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on clinical outcomes in adult COVID- 19 patients.Our primary objective was to evaluate the impact of vitamin D sup- plementation on mortality and hospital length of stay.Secondary ob- jectives included investigating changes in C- reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D- dimer, hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations, and lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts following vitamin D supplementation.2 | METHODS This meta- analysis was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.27 The study was registered in the Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO (registration ID: CRD42023441017).
2.1 | Search study To find relevant articles, a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The search strategy involved two concept keywords: COVID- 19 and vitamin D supplementation.The details of the search strategy used in this search are shown in Table S1.We also conducted a manual search of references listed in relevant review articles, including backward and forward searches and queries using Google Scholar, to ensure that no relevant research was missed.The search was conducted without any language restrictions.In our systematic review, while our primary focus was on peer- reviewed papers to ensure reliability and quality, we conducted a targeted search for gray literature.This involved exploring sources such as conference proceedings, dissertations, theses, government reports, and other relevant documents.Additionally, we did not include preprint studies in our analysis.
After conducting a systematic search, the obtained records were transferred to the EndNote software to perform the screening process. After removing duplicate records, two researchers independently reviewed the titles and abstracts to exclude articles with unrelated titles from the review process.Any discrepancies between the findings of the two researchers were resolved through consultation with a third person.2.2 | Eligibility criteria In the second stage, the screening process was carried out based on the population, intervention/exposure, comparator, outcome, and study design (PICOS) criteria.The PICOS framework was used for in- clusion and exclusion criteria.
The inclusion criteria include: (1) clinical trial studies with a control group conducted on adults over 18 years old; (2) vitamin D supplementation of at least one dose in patients with COVID- 19; (3) comparison of at least one of the outcomes con- sidered in this study (mortality, length of hospital stay, CRP, ferritin, D- dimer, Hb concentrations, and lymphocyte, neutrophil, and plate- let counts) between the intervention and control groups reported at the beginning and end of the intervention. Studies that had a design other than a clinical trial, or were conducted on animal samples, or on children, were excluded.Additionally, studies that evaluated vita- min D simultaneously with other agents, where it was not possible to assess the independent effect of vitamin D, were excluded from the analysis.Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in Table S2.2.3 | Data extraction Two researchers independently extracted the required data from the articles.
This information includes the name of the first author, year | 3 of 14 GHORESHI et al. of publication, country, study sample size and gender distribution, mean age of the participants, vitamin D dosage, duration of the in- tervention, control group, and the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the investigated variables.Any disagreement between the two researchers was resolved through consultation with a third person.2.4 | Assessment of the risk of bias and certainty of the evidence The Cochrane risk- of- bias tool (RoB 2), specifically designed for randomized trials, was utilized to assess the risk of bias within this study.
This methodology includes criteria for selection bias, detection bias, performance bias, reporting bias, attrition bias, and other potential biases.28 The overall strength of the evidence was determined using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method.29,30 According to our evaluation criteria, the estimates of biomarker effects were categorized into four quality tiers: high, moderate, low, and very low. The reviewers separately conducted GRADE assessments, and conflicts between reviewers were settled by a third reviewer.2.5 | Data analysis The information obtained from the primary articles was first entered into Excel software and then transferred to Stata 14 software (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) for statistical analysis.Intervention ef- fects were determined as the mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained for changes in serum concentrations of CRP and D- dimer, as well as length of hospital stay.
We used the following formula to compute SD change from SD baseline in both interven- tion and control groups: /uni221A.s2/bracketleft.s2/parenleft.s2 SD2 baseline+SD2 ﬁnal/parenright.s2 −/parenleft.s12×R×SDbaseline ×SDﬁnal/parenright.s1/bracketright.s2 . The I2 statistic and Cochran's chi- square test (Q) were used for evalu- ation of studies heterogeneity.If the I2 was above 50%, we used the random- effect model, and if the I2 was below 50%, we used the fixed- effect model.Also, sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the effect of removing each study on the results.Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot and Egger's and Begg's test.31 Subgroup analyses were conducted based on participants' baseline vitamin D concentrations (≤22 ng/mL and >22 ng/mL), age (≤60 years and >60 years), and vi- tamin D dosage (≤10 000 international units [IU] and >10 000 IU).A p- value of <.05 was, a priori, considered statistically significant, unless otherwise specified.
3 | RESULTS 3.1 | Literature search and characteristics of included studies At the end of the systematic search process, 8661 records were identified, and after removing duplicate records, 5703 articles entered the screening phase. After a systematic search and two stages of screening, 16 studies met the necessary criteria to be included in this study.23,24,32–45 The article selection process is displayed in the flowchart (Figure 1), following the PRISMA method.27 From the included studies, two studies were conducted in Egypt, two studies in Brazil, three studies in Spain, and one study each in Croatia, Switzerland, India, Argentina, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and France.The sample size in the evaluated studies ranged from 40 to 237 patients.The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1.The dose of vitamin D used in the studies varied from 2000 to 500 000 IU.
In the com- parison group, three studies used a low dose of vitamin D,32,34,41 and in the remaining studies, placebo was used. No prevention tri- als were included.3.2 | Risk of bias assessment The results of the risk- of- bias assessment are shown in Table 2.All the trials used acceptable random sequence generation.In term of allocation concealment, six studies had acceptable condi- tions,32,36,37,40,41,43 three studies had a high risk of bias,39,42,43 and for the remaining studies, the risk of bias is unclear.Also, in terms of blinding, we found a high risk of bias in four studies, 10 trials had a low risk of bias, and in two studies, the risk- of- bias assessment was unclear.Moreover, only four studies received a low risk- of- bias FIGURE 1 Selection process for eligible studies from all identified citations.4 of 14 | GHORESHI et al.TABLE 1 Characteristics of included studies.

studies (2.44% vs. 2.27%).34 Soliman et al., in a trial among diabetic elderly patients, did not find any significant differences in mortality rate between the vitamin D and placebo groups (17.5% vs.18.8%).35 In line with the results of this study, there were no significant differences be- tween vitamin D and control groups in terms of COVID- 19 mortal- ity in other studies, including Sarhan et al.(45% vs.51%, p = .49),36 Mariani et al.(4.3% vs.1.9%, p = .451),37 and Elamir et al.
(three deaths in the control group and none in the vitamin D group, p = .23).38 However, in one study conducted among older adult pa- tients with COVID- 19, it was reported that a single oral high dose of cholecalciferol led to a significant improvement in overall mor- tality at day 14 (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.16, 0.99], p = .049).43 3.4 | Effects of vitamin D supplementation on hospital length of stay Eight trials, including 944 patients (471 treated and 473 controls), provided data related to the effects of vitamin D supplementation on hospital length of stay.23,24,34,35,37,38,40,43 As shown in Figure 2, vitamin D supplementation led to a significant reduction in hospi- tal length of stay (mean difference = −1.16 [95% CI: −2.23, −0.09]; p = .033), with a significant heterogeneity (I2 = 69.2%, p = .002).
In the subgroup analysis, we found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the length of hospital stay in studies where the vitamin D dosage was ≤10 000 IU (mean difference = −1.27 [95% CI: −1.96, −0.57]; p < .001) and in older adult patients over 60 years old (mean difference = −1.84 [95% CI: −2.53, −1.14]; p < .001). The results of the subgroup analysis are summarized in Table 3.The leave- one- out sensitivity analysis showed that leaving each of the trials resulted in a range from −0.809 [95% CI: −1.79, −0.17] by Torres et al.to −1.40 [95% CI: −2.58, −0.23] by Mariani et al., with no significant effect on the pooled effect size.34,37 A funnel plot (Figure 3A) indicated no substantial evidence of publication bias (Egger's test p = .784; Begg's test p = .71).Study (year) Study design CountryTotal sample size (intervention/ control)Age, mean (SD)Baseline 25(OH)D concentrationsVitamin D dosage/ duration Control Outcomes Sánchez- Zuno et al.

3.5 | Effects of vitamin D supplementation on inflammatory markers The effect of vitamin D supplementation on CRP concen- trations in patients with COVID- 19 was investigated in 11 studies.23,24,32–36,39–41,45 The results showed that vitamin D sup- plementation did not lead to a significant decrease in CRP concen- trations compared to placebo (mean difference = −0.48 [95% CI: −1.30, 0.34]; p = .255), with a significant heterogeneity (I2 = 91.1%, p < .001) (Figure 4). The subgroup analysis reported that vitamin D supplementation led to a significant reduction in serum con- centrations of CRP in older adult patients over 60 years old (mean difference = −1.13 [95% CI: −2.07, −0.18]; p = .019).The results of sensitivity analysis showed that removing each of the trials in a range from −0.28 [95% CI: −1.1, 0.53] by Jaun et al.
to −0.67 [95% CI: −1.57, 0.22] by Murai et al., did not change the significance of the results.23,40 There was no substantial evidence of publication bias based on the funnel plot (Figure 3B) and Egger's test (Egger's test p = .132; Begg's test p = .484). Overall, six studies provided sufficient data on the effect of vi- tamin D on ferritin concentrations.32,33,36,39,41,45 According to the meta- analysis, there were no significant effects of vitamin D on fer- ritin concentrations (mean difference = −1.24 [95% CI: −8.27, 5.80]; p = .730; I2 = 79.5%, p < .002) (Figure 5).Subgroup analysis could not identify the source of heterogeneity.Also, the results of the sensi- tivity analysis showed that removing any of the studies had no ef- fect on the results.Moreover, based on the publication bias test, there was no substantial evidence of publication bias between stud- ies (Egger's test p = .322; Begg's test p = .851) (Figure 3C).
Seven studies compared the effects of vitamin D supplemen- tation on D- dimer concentrations.24,32,33,35,36,40,41 The results of the pooled analysis showed that vitamin D did not significantly change the D- dimer concentrations (mean difference = 0.37 [95% CI: −0.15, 0.9]; p = .166), with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 94.2%, p < .001) (Figure 6). Subgroup analysis reported that vitamin D had a significant effect on D- dimer concentrations among patients with baseline 25(OH)D concentrations greater than 22 ng/mL (mean dif- ference = 1.48 [95% CI: 0.08, 2.88]; p = .038).Sensitivity analysis suggested no difference in the results following the exclusion of any of the trials.Additionally, no significant evidence of publication bias was found (Egger's test p = .538; Begg's test p = .652).

Additionally, no significant evidence of publication bias was found (Egger's test p = .988; Begg's test p = .734).3.7 | Effects of vitamin D supplementation on lymphocytes and neutrophil count Five studies reported the effect of vitamin D supplementation on lymphocyte numbers.35,39–41,45 It was found that vitamin D supple- mentation did not significantly change lymphocyte numbers com- pared to the control group (mean difference = −270 [95% CI: −930, 390]; p = .421), with a significant heterogeneity (I2 = 98.4%, p < .001). The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that removing any of the studies had no significant effect on the results.Additionally, nei- ther Begg's test (p = .806) nor Egger's test (p = .748), nor a visual in- spection of the funnel plot showed any publication bias.
The effect of vitamin D on neutrophil count was evaluated in three studies.39–41 According to the meta- analysis, vitamin D FIGURE 4 Forest plot detailing weighted mean difference and 95% CIs for the impact of vitamin D supplementation on CRP concentrations.

The evidence for CRP, ferritin, Hb, and lymphocyte was downgraded to low. Finally, evidence regarding D- dimer, platelet, and neutrophil was identified as very low quality (Table 4).4 | DISCUSSION Vitamin D, as a critical fat- soluble vitamin, plays an important role in a large number of metabolic processes within the body.Due to the importance of this vitamin in metabolic processes as well as immune system enhancement, it was one of the main nutritional supplements recommended during the COVID- 19 pandemic.However, the evidence regarding the efficacy of this vitamin in managing COVID- 19 symptoms remains contradictory.46,47 The results of the present systematic review and meta- analysis showed that vitamin D supplementation led to a significant reduction in length of hospital stay.Additionally, the results showed that vitamin D supplementation in elderly patients caused a significant decrease in CRP concentrations.
However, we did not find any significant effect from vitamin D supplementation in terms of other hematological and immune system biomarkers. The results of epidemiological studies showed that vita- min D deficiency significantly increases the risk of ARDS.48,49 Additionally, some studies indicated that an improvement in vitamin D serum concentrations was associated with a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation among critically ill pa- tients, particularly those with COVID- 19.50,51 Various reasons can be proposed to explain the mechanisms involved in the shorten- ing of hospital stay after vitamin D supplementation.
It has been shown that vitamin D exerts antimicrobial effects by stimulating the production of compounds such as nitric oxide and superox- ide.52,53 Also, some studies have suggested that vitamin D can improve the antimicrobial activity of other proteins, such as cathe- licidin.54 Some studies have shown that vitamin D can strengthen antiviral immunity, which is effective in managing the symptoms of COVID- 19 and shortening the length of hospitalization. This includes several concurrent antibacterial processes, such as the activation of cathelicidin and defensins, which can prevent viral entry into cells and decrease viral multiplication.55 Enhancing autophagy is another characteristic of vitamin D related to both antibacterial and antiviral processes.
Autophagy is a crucial bio- logical mechanism that preserves cellular homeostasis by encasing malfunctioning organelles and improperly folded proteins inside the cell membrane.56 Unlike the duration of hospitalization, most of the studies re- viewed in this article reported that vitamin D supplementation did not have a significant effect on reducing the risk of mortality in COVID- 19 patients. In line with our findings, the results of another meta- analysis showed that vitamin D supplementation had no signif- icant effect on reducing the risk of mortality in COVID- 19 patients.26 In the present study, we could not find significant effects of vita- min D on CRP concentrations, as well as on lymphocyte and neutro- phil counts.However, in the subgroup analysis, CRP concentrations in individuals over 60 years old were significantly reduced following vitamin D supplementation.
The evaluation of these factors was im- portant because, theoretically, part of the positive effect of vitamin D against COVID- 19 is due to its ability to strengthen the host's im- mune system and suppress inflammatory cytokines in the body.57,58 However, given that the studied patients differed in terms of their FIGURE 6 Forest plot detailing weighted mean difference and 95% CIs for the impact of vitamin D supplementation on D- dimer concentrations.

Elevated ferritin con- centrations could trigger a cytokine storm due to their direct im - munosuppressive and pro- inflammatory effects.60–62 According to our knowledge, this study was the first meta- analysis that examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on factors such as length of hospital stay and inflammatory and hema- tological biomarkers among patients with COVID- 19. Previous meta- analyses focused mostly on mortality, intensive care unit length of stay, and risk of infection.25,26 Also, another strength of this study compared to previous meta- analyses was that the strength of the evidence was also examined based on the GRADE framework.The present study had several limitations that should be consid- ered when interpreting the results.First, there was significant varia- tion among the participants regarding COVID- 19 severity, duration, medications, and baseline vitamin D concentrations, which could in- fluence outcomes and contribute to observed heterogeneity.
Second, the types and dosages of vitamin D supplementation varied widely across studies, with some using mega doses and others daily doses, complicating direct comparisons and conclusions about optimal dos- ing. Third, despite our extensive search and rigorous criteria, the num- ber of studies meeting inclusion criteria was relatively small, limiting our ability to conduct detailed subgroup analyses, especially regarding COVID- 19 severity.Fourth, focusing exclusively on peer- reviewed pa- pers might have missed relevant findings from preprints or ongoing studies, affecting the comprehensiveness of our meta- analysis.Fifth, most included studies reported high heterogeneity due to differences in study design, population characteristics, intervention protocols, and outcome measures.Although we used random effects models and conducted sensitivity analyses to address this, variability remains a challenge.
Lastly, reliance on published data without access to indi- vidual patient data limited our ability to perform detailed analyses and adjust for potential confounders at the patient level. 5 | CONCLUSIONS Our study focused on the impact of vitamin D supplementation in hos- pitalized COVID- 19 patients, aiming to evaluate its effects on various factors.The results revealed a significant reduction in hospital length of stay among patients who received vitamin D supplementation, particularly in those who received a dosage of ≤10 000 IU and in older adult patients over 60 years old.Additionally, we observed a notewor- thy decrease in CRP concentrations in older adults aged over 60 years.Despite these positive outcomes, no significant effects of vitamin D were observed on biomarkers such as ferritin, D- dimer, and Hb con- centrations, or on lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS FS, Z- a- sG, and JC participated in the design and coordination of the study.
