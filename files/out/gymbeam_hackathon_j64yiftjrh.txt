The purpose of this prospective cross -sectional study was to assess seminal plasma LC levels in infertile oligoathe- noteratozoospermic (OAT) men with varicocele. Methods: Overall, 86 men were investigated.They were divided into infertile OAT men with varicocele (n=45), infertile OAT men without varicocele (n=21), and fer- tile men (n=20) as a control group.According to WHO guidelines, these men were subjected to history taking, clinical examination, and semen analysis.Seminal LC levels were evaluated by the colorimetric method.Statistical comparisons were done using Kruskal -Wallis and Mann -Whitney U tests and correlations were verified by the Pearson test.P -value<0.05 was set to be statistically significant.Results: The mean seminal plasma LC levels were significantly lower in infertile OAT men with varicocele (216.3±57.1 ng/ml ) compared to infertile OAT men with- out varicocele (252.9±62.9 ng/ml , p=0.01), or fertile men (382.8±63.6 ng/ml , p= 0.001).
Besides, the mean seminal plasma LC level exhibited statistically significant decreases in infertile OAT men of varicocele grade III compared to varicocele grade II cases, and in infertile OAT men with bilateral varicocele compared with unilateral varicocele cases. Collectively, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between seminal LC levels with sperm concentration, motility, and normal morphol- ogy.Conclusion: Seminal LC levels are expressively reduced in infertile OAT men with varicocele and are influenced by an increase in varicocele grade and laterality.Keywords: Oligoasthenoteratozoospermic, Infertility, L -Carnitine, Men, Semen, S perm, Varicocele.To cite this article: Mostafa T, Abougabal K, Mintziori G, Nabil N , Adel M, AboSief AF.Seminal L -Carnitine In Infertile Oligoasthenoteratozoospermic Men with Varicocele .J Re- prod Infertil.2022;23(1): 26-32.http://dx.doi.org/10.18502/jri.v23i1.8449.
Introduction pproximately, in 50% of infertile couples, nonstandard semen parameters point to male factor infertility (1). Various reasons have been offered for male factor infertility, the most important of which are hormonal imbalance, con - genital anamolies, inflam matory problems, envi - ronment/lifestyle, as well as varicocele (2 -5).Varicocele has been reported in about 20% of adults and adolescents and 19 -41% of males are suffering from infertility problems (6).Varicocele is habitually linked to decreased sperm count, to- tal sperm motility, and normal morphology per-* Corresponding Author: Taymour Mostafa, Department of Andrology, Sexology & STIs, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt E-mail: taymour.mostafa@yahoo .com Received: Apr.3, 2021 Accepted: Jul.5, 2021 J Reprod Infertil, Vol 23, No 1, Jan -Mar 2022 27 Mostafa T, et al.JRI centages (7 -9).Many concepts were raised to elu- cidate how varicocele has a negative influence on male fertility.
Those concepts comprise scrotal hyperthermia, Leydig cell dysfunction, metaboli - tes retrograde flow, hypoxia, oxidative stress (OS), and apoptosis (10 , 11). L-Carnitine (LC) is an endogenous branched - chain non -essential amino acid derivative that is manufactured in multiple organs such as liver, kidneys, and testes, originating from L-lysine and L-methionine (12).Intracellular LC takes part in the lipid metabolism by transporting fatty acids from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria for β -oxi- dation (13, 14).Higher concentrations of LC were reported in the human epididymis than in the peripheral blood (15, 16).Seminal LC was shown to play its role by improving the environment in the epididymal lumen and affecting β -oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria.Besides, seminal LC was de - monstrated to imitate the effects of glucocortico id that suppresses the macrophages protecting sperm membrane and chromatin from the damage of free oxygen radicals (17).
Numerous studies showed the valuable effects of LC intake on sperm motility, and sperm DNA fragmentation concluding that combining meta- bolic and micro -nutritive aspects is helpful for male factor infertility treatment (18 -22). Tsampo - ukas et al.(23) pointed out that although the evi- dence regarding the role of LC as a primary or adjuvant treatment of varicocele is sparse, the pathophysiol ogical signiﬁcance of LC implicates a potential role of the molecule in the manage- ment of varicocele.In this context, scarce studies investigated the re- lationship of seminal LC with male factor infer- tility associated with varicocele (24 -26).There- fore, t here is a gap in the literature and clinical practice regarding association of LC deficiency with both the grade as well as severity of varico- cele.Therefore, this work was designed to evalu- ate seminal plasma LC levels in infertile OAT men with varicocele.
Methods This prospective cross -sectional study comprised 66 infertile OAT men who were recruited from the University Hospital, in addition to 20 healthy fertile men as controls, after obtaining the ethics committee approval in addition to informed con- sents. Sample size calculation was based on a sin- gle proportion formula (27).The cases were di-vided into 3 groups of fertile males without vari- cocele (n=20), infertile OAT men without varico- cele (n=21), and infertile OAT men with varico- cele (n=45) .Fertile controls fulfilled the criteria for normozoospermia (s perm concentration >15 million/ml , total sperm motility >40%, and sperm normal forms >4%) and having offspring in the previous two years.Inclusion criter ia of the pa- tients' group were OAT (sperm concentration <15 million/ml , total sperm motility <40%, and sperm normal forms <4%), lack of initiating pregnancy within a year of unguarded sexual relation, and normal female factor.
Exclusion criteria were azo - ospermia, secondary varicocele, congenital anom- alies, smoking, and leuk ocytospermia. All participants were subjected to history taking, genital examination, and semen analysis.The ejacu - lates were collected after 4 -5 days of sexual absti- nence and were inspected according to WHO guidelines (28).Clinical examination was carr ied out in the standing position with/without the Vals - alva maneuver.Color Doppler was carried out to diagnose varicocele (29).Varicocele was classi- fied into grade I (only palpable during Valsalva maneuver), grade II (palpable distension on stand- ing upri ght), and grade III (visible through scrotal skin) (30).LC levels in the seminal plasma were estimated utilizing a colorimetric assay kit (Bio- Vision, USA).The range for L -Carnitine is ~1 - 200 µM with a detection sensitivity of 10 µM (co- lorimetric).Statistical analysis : SPSS software version 23 (IBM, USA) was used for the statistical analysis.
Kolmogorov -Smirnov test demonstrated that the data were not normally distributed . Comparisons amongst the investigated groups were carried out using Kruskal -Wallis and Mann -Whitney U tests for non -parametric data.Correlations between the variables were verified by the Pearson test.The p - value <0.05 was set to be statistically significant.Results The participants demonstrated matched age and no statistically significant difference was found between all investigated groups (p=0.173).Clini- cally, the group of infertile OAT men with varico- cele consisted of 20 cases that had grade II vari- cocele and 25 cases that had grade III varicocele.Additionally, 10 cases had unilateral varicocele and 35 cases had bilateral varicocele.
The mean seminal plasma LC levels were lower in infertile OAT men with varicocele compared to infertile OAT men with no varicocele as well as fertile 28 J Reprod Infertil, Vol 23, No 1, Jan -Mar 2022 Seminal L -Carnitine in OAT Men with Varicocele JRI controls and the differences were statistically sig- nificant (p=0.001) (Table 1). In infertile OAT men with varicocele, the mean seminal LC levels were lower in infertile OAT men with grade III varico- cele (n=21) compared to infertile OAT men with grade II (n=25) (p= 0.001) (Table 2), and in infer- tile OAT men with bilateral varicocele (n=35) compared with infertile OAT men with unilateral varicocele (n=10); the obtained differences were statistically significant (p=0.036) (Table 3).Col- lectively, seminal LC levels exhibite d statistically significant positive correlations with sperm con- centration (r=0.638, p=0.001), total motility per- centages (r=0.705, p=0.001), and normal forms percentages (r=0.690, p=0.001) (Figure 1).
Discussion Varicocele is one of the common correctable causes of male infertility. It has been demonstrat- ed that varicocelectomy in men with abnormal se - men parameters was associated with better fertili- ty outcome.The adjuvant drug therapy, especially Table 1.

JRI different types of antioxidants, seems to be asso- ciated with better fertility outcome, in comparison with no medical treatment (31, 32).Therefore, assessment of some antioxidants such as LC could be beneficial for clinical purposes.
In this study, the mean seminal plasma LC levels were significantly lower in infertile OAT men with varicocele compared to infertile OAT men without varicocele and fertile controls. Besides, seminal plasma LC levels exhibited statistically significant positive correlations with sperm con- centration, motil ity, and normal forms percent- ages.Those aforementioned outcomes show the association of normal levels of seminal LC with normozoospermic semen parameters.Matalliotakis et al.(33) reported that seminal LC levels differ significantly between fertile men and infertile men and there is statistical ly significant positive correlation between the levels and sperm count, motility percentage, and normal forms per- centage.Moreover, several researchers reported statistically significant positive correlations be- tween seminal LC levels with total sperm count and sperm normal morphology percentage (34 - 36).
Furthermore, the role of seminal free LC in the preservation of normal sperm features was validated in previous research (37 -39). Reviewing the literature, most studies that linked varicocele with male infertility focused mainly on the role of testis.Yet, it was suggested that vari- cocele can also disturb the epididymis that plays a central role in sperm maturation, sperm motility, and is the place where the sperm nucleus alters chromatin condensation (15, 40, 41).Previously, Lenzi et al.(42) pointed out that the effects of LC on the male genital function are connected mainly with its high concentration in the epididymis where the uptake of the LC from the blood is active.Mor eover, epididymal sperm can concentrate LC during their passage from the caput to the cauda to provide patterns of energetic substrate.
This function is of great importance since epididymal sperm employ fatty acid oxida- tion for their energy metabolism; on the contrary, the ejaculated sperm employ the glycolytic pro- cess. Besides, c arnitines also possess both antiox- idant as well as anti -apoptotic properties (43, 44) that could counteract the accentuated burden of the seminal OS as well as apoptotic markers in infertile men associated with varicocele (8, 45, 46).These effects were perceived with the statistical- ly significant decreases in seminal LC levels in infertile OAT men of grade III varicocele com- pared to infertile OAT men of grade II, and in men with bi lateral varicocele compared with uni- lateral one .This relation could be explained due to the increased OS effect associated with these conditions on the antioxidant LC.Lehtihet et al.
(47) concluded that left -sided grade III varicocele could induce a reve rsible suppression of the epi- didymal function where treatment of varicocele results in improved semen quality as well as epi- didymal function. Sofimajidpour et al.(48) report - ed statistically significant decreases in sperm total motility in grade III varic ocele compared to grade II varicocele.Also, Mostafa et al.(49) showed that different seminal miRNA levels are lowered in infertile OAT men with varicocele which is linked to elevated varicocele grade and its bilater- ality is negatively correlated with OS (apoptotic Figure 1.Significant positive correlations between seminal plasma LC ( ng/ml ) levels with sperm concentration, total sperm motility percentage s, and sperm normal forms percent - ages 30 J Reprod Infertil, Vol 23, No 1, Jan -Mar 2022 Seminal L -Carnitine in OAT Men with Varicocele JRI markers).Besides, Alkan et al.(50) and Ashraf - zade et al.
(51) linked ROS overproduction to ele- vated varicocele grade, reduced semen concentra- tion, and normal sperm morphology. However, this study still has some limitations due to the relatively low number of participants, the need to investigate fertile men with varicocele, and the necessity to assess seminal LC after vari- cocele surgical repair in infertile OAT men with varicocele .Conclusion The aforementioned results show that seminal plasma LC levels are significantly reduced in in- fertile OAT men with varicocele and are influ- enced by an increase in its grade and laterality.This finding indicates the benefits of assessing the seminal plasma LC in clinical practice among these men.Additionally, LC supplementation should be evaluated in such cases with/without varicocele surgical repair.Acknowledgement None.Conflict of Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.Funding: None .References 1.Punab M, Poolamets O, Paju P, Vihljajev V, Pomm K, Ladva R, et al.
