So far, examples of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) acting as allosteric activators of enzyme activity are missing. Here, we describe the function of mitolnc in cardiom y ocytes, a nuclear encoded long non- coding RNA, located in mitochondria and directly interacting with the branc hed-c hain k etoacid deh y drogenase (BCKDH) comple x to increase its activity.The BCKDH complex is critical for branc hed-c hain amino acid catabolism (BCAAs).Inactivation of mitolnc in mice reduces BCKDH complex activity, resulting in accumulation of BCAAs in the heart and cardiac h ypertroph y via enhanced mTOR signaling.We found that mitolnc allosterically activates the BCKDH complex, independent of phosphorylation.Mitolnc-mediated regulation of the BCKDH complex constitutes an important additional la y er to regulate the BCKDH complex in a tissue-specific manner, e v ading direct coupling of BCAA metabolism to ACLY- dependent lipogenesis.
Gr aphical abstr act Introduction The essential branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) valine, leucine and isoleucine are important building blocks of life, contributing to protein synthesis. Moreover, BCAAs and some of their products serve as signaling molecules, regulating pro- tein synthesis, insulin secretion and other processes.Del- icate changes in BCAA metabolism are assumed to con- tribute to heart failure and several other widespread dis- eases ( 1 ).The first steps of BCAA catabolism are common for all three BCAAs and consist of a reversible transamina- tion and a virtually irreversible oxidative decarboxylation.Reversible transamination is achieved by BCAA aminotrans- ferases (BCATs) that transfer the amino group of BCAAs to α- ketoglutarate, generating branched-chain ketoacids (BCKAs).
BCAT1 is localized in the cytosol and BCAT2 is localized at the inner membrane of the mitochondria where it forms a tem- porary structural-functional complex, a metabolon, with the branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH complex), which mediates the second, rate-limiting step of ir- reversible oxidative decarboxylation. The BCKDH complex consists of the three components E1, E2 and E3.The E1 component is a thiamine-dependent decarboxylase, contain- ing BCKDHA and BCKDHB heterotetramers.The E2 compo- nent is DBT, a dihydrolipoyl transacylase mediating the trans- fer of the acyl group to coenzyme A.The E3 component is DLD , an F AD-dependent dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase medi- ating the transfer of electrons to NAD + .Subsequent process- ing of the branched chain acyl-CoAs diverges according to the Received: August 24, 2023.Revised: March 12, 2024.Editorial Decision: March 14, 2024.Accepted: March 19, 2024 ©T h e Author(s) 2024.

Phosphorylation by BCKDH kinase (BDK) ( 4 ) results in inactivation of the BCKDH complex while PPM1K is the corresponding phosphatase activating the BCKDH complex ( 5 ,6 ). BDK is allosterically inhibited by branched-chain ketoacids, creating a positive feedback loop.Interestingly, BDK and PPM1K also have essential roles in lipid metabolism by regulating the activity of ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), which catalyzes the conversion of citrate to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, thereby promoting lipogenesis and reducing fatty acid oxidation ( 7 ,8 ).BDK activates ACLY by phosphorylation at serine 454 and dephosphorylation by PPM1K inhibits ACLY, integrating BCAAs catabolism with li- pogenesis ( 9 ,10 ).The BCAA leucine has well described anabolic effects ( 11 ), achieved by stimulation of mTOR signaling via different mechanisms.Leucine is sensed by Sestrin1 / 2 and activates mT OR signals via GAT OR2 / 1-RA G ( 12 , 13 ).
Leucine might also be sensed by the SLC38A9-RAG-Ragulator complex at the lysosomal surface to activate mTOR via Rheb ( 14 ,15 ). Al- ternatively, leucine concentration might also be detected by the leucyl tRNA synthetase 1 (LARS1) ( 16 ), whose activity is glucose-dependent ( 17 ), illustrating the complexity of regula- tory networks involving leucine.Another important signaling effect of leucine is the allosteric activation of glutamate dehy- drogenase (GDH) ( 18 ,19 ), yielding α-ketoglutarate.Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have not been assumed to play a direct role in the regulation of BCAA metabolism so far.LncRNAs are longer than 200 nucleotides, are not trans- lated into functional proteins, usually show a very poor con- servation of their primary sequences during evolution, and are generated by widespread transcription of genomes, resulting in a highly heterogeneous group of transcripts with differ- ent biogenesis and genomic origin.
Current estimates range from 16 000 to 100 000 lncRNA genes in the human genome ( 20 ,21 ). An increasing number of functional studies indicate the importance of lncRNAs for the regulation of multiple cel- lular processes.In many cases, lncRNAs regulate chromatin activity, often in cis , next to lncRNA-expressing loci ( 22 ,23 ) or in trans within the nucleus to activate and repress gene ac- tivity ( 24 ).Moreover, several lncRNAs are exported to the cytosol, probably sharing the same pathways with mRNAs.Some lncRNAs are sorted into mitochondria such as the RNA component of mitochondrial RNA-processing endoribonucle- ase (RMRP), which is bound and stabilized by the G-rich RNA sequence-binding factor 1 (GRSF1), enabling enrichment in the mitochondrial matrix ( 25 ).However, only limited insight exists regarding the physiological function of lncRNAs, which are limited to in vitro studies in melanoma cells, fibroblasts and macrophages ( 25–29 ).
In this study, we investigate the physiological roles of cardiac-restricted and nucleus-encoded lncRNAs that are transferred into mitochondria. We identified a lncRNA (AK079912) that we named mitolnc, which interacts with the BCKDH complex in the mitochondrial matrix and allosteri- cally regulates its activity.Inactivation of mitolnc reduces ac- tivity of the BCKDH complex and results in accumulation of BCAAs in the adult heart, which enhances mTOR signaling and induces cardiac hypertrophy.Mitolnc-dependent control of the BCKDH complex circumvents phosphorylation-based regulation by BDK and PPM1K, thereby uncoupling BCAA catabolism from fatty acid metabolism in the heart.Materials and methods Animal models Two pairs of sgRNAs were used in a double nicking ap- proach ( 30 ) to direct hSpCas9n (D10A) expressed from a modified pX335 vector (addgene #42335) carrying an addi- tional EF1a-copGFP-T2A-Puromycin R cassette.
Pairs of sgR- NAs were designed to target sequences 5 ′ (guide sequences: p894: GGA TGAAA TTT ACTTT AAGT, p895: gCCA TGCAA- GA GAAAA CTC AT) and 3 ′ (p898: GTGC AC AATAGTTTTG- GTTT, p899: GT ACCT AAAGCCCTGGGTGA) of the ge- nomic locus of AK079912. The four px335-derived plasmids containing the respective U6-driven sgRNAs were transfected into mouse embryonic stem cells using Lipofectamine™ 3000 (Thermo Fisher #L3000001) followed by puromycin selection (2 μg / μl, 1 day after transfection for 2 days) to obtain mu- tant clones that were detected by PCR using oligonucleotides.All oligonucleotide sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1 .For an alternative loss of function model, a poly A site was inserted into the first exon of AK079912 using the px459 pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro vector (pSpCas9(BB)- 2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid #62988; http:// n2t.net/ addgene:62988; RRID:A ddgene_62988) ( 31 ).
The px459 vector was used with a specific guide sequence (gCA GA GCTTGGGATCC- CTCAT) and in combination with a single-stranded oligo (cattgaggatcctggctctgctaaggactctgcactctgcttagaatcctggctccaa tgagggatcccaaattctggttacaaataaagcaatagcatcacaaatttcacaaa taaagcatttttttcacctggctctgacatctacttccagtgaccttggacaagttgc tccttccttctagagctcagtcttccaa) for homology directed repair. 0.5 μg of the plasmid and 1.5 μg of oligonucleotide were transfected into 3 ×10 5 embryonic stem cells using Lipofec- tamine™ 3000, followed by puromycin selection (2 μg / μl, 48 h).Clones with recombinant alleles were identified by PCR using oligonucleotides listed in Supplementary Table S1 .Am- plicons were sequenced to identify correctly targeted clones.Chimeric mice were generated by injection of embryonic stem cells into blastocysts, chimeras were backcrossed to 129SV mice and heterozygous mice were mated to obtain mitolnc −/ − or mitolnc pA / pA mice and the respective WT mice.
High BCAA diet was obtained from Sniff ( www.sniff.com , S7507- E054, 4.3% BCAA; Crystalline AA diet). Mice were fed ad libitum for 8 weeks.Encapsulated Rapamycin was obtained from Rapamycin Holdings ( www.rapamycinholdings.com ) to produce 14 ppm active rapamycin supplemented diet and respective control diet containing the rapamycin vehicle Eu- dragit by Envigo—Teklad Diets (TD.160060 based on 2018 Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet, www.envigo.com ).Mice were fed ad libitum for 8 weeks.If not otherwise stated mice were kept in IVC with ad libitum access to water and food.All animal experiments were done in accordance with national and European community guidelines and were ap- proved by the Committee for Animal Protection of the State of Hessen (Regierungspraesidium Darmstadt).Nucleic Acids Research , 2024, Vol.52, No.11 6631 BCAA serum concentration To analyze BCAA levels in blood serum we sacrificed the mice via decapitation and collected the blood.
To obtain blood serum the blood coagulated for 5 min at room temperature followed by 5 min centrifugation at 14 000 rpm. BCAA levels of serum samples were obtained by using the branched chain amino acid assay kit from abcam (#ab83374) according to manufacturer’s specifications.Isolation of mouse cardiomyocytes Animals were sacrificed via i.p.injections of 100 μl / 10 g bodyweight Ketamin / Xylariem (4 ml NaCl 0.9%, 0.5 ml Ke- tamin, 0.25 ml Xylariem).Hearts were collected and washed and perfused with perfusion buffer (NaCl 113 mM, KCl 4.7 mM, Na 2 HPO 4 0.6 mM, KH 2 PO 4 0.6 mM, MgSO 4 1.2 mM, NaHCO 3 12 mM, KHCO 3 10 mM, taurine 30 mM, HEPES 10 mM, 2,3-butanedione monoxime 10 mM, glucose 5.5 mM).Cells were digested via perfusion of the hearts with enzyme buffer (perfusion buffer, Liberase DH 0.25 mg / ml (Roche #05401089001), Trypsin 0.27 mg / ml (Sigma #T7409), CaCl 2 23.2 μM).The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding Stop buffer (perfusion buffer, FCS 5%, CaCl 2 12.5 μM).
Isolation of nuclei and cytoplasm For isolation of nuclei and cytoplasm, mouse cardiomyocytes were isolated and washed with ice-cold PBS pH 7.4. Samples were centrifuged (1000 ×g, 10 min at 4 ◦C) and the pellet re-suspended in 100 μl Buffer A (10 mM Tris / HCl pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5% Nonidet P-40).Samples were incubated on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged (1000 ×g, 3 min at 4 ◦C).The supernatant, containing the extranu- clear fraction was collected and mixed with 700 μl Trizol for RNA isolation.The pellet was washed twice using Buffer A and then re-suspended in Buffer B (Buffer A + 1% Tween-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) followed by another centrifuga- tion for 5 min.The pellet containing the nuclear fraction was re-suspended in 700 μl Trizol for RNA isolation.Isolation of mitochondria Mitochondrial isolation was performed as described previ- ously ( 32 ,33 ).In brief, mice were sacrificed by cervical dis- location and perfused with PBS.
Hearts were transferred into PBD (1 ×PBS pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA) and minced using a pair of scissors. The tissue was washed twice with PBD and then incubated with PBD-T (PBD, 0.05% Trypsin) on ice for 30 min.The samples were centrifuged at 200 ×g for 5 min at 4 ◦C.The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml IBM 1 pH 7.4 (6.7 ml Sucrose (1 M), 5 ml Tris / HCl (1 M), 5 ml KCl (1 M), 2 ml BSA (10%) ad.100 ml ddH 2 O).Samples were homoge- nized using a potter homogenizer (10 strokes at 1600 rpm).The homogenate was centrifuged (700 ×g, 10 min at 4 ◦C).The pellet (cell debris) was used as heart / rest fraction in the downstream analysis.The supernatant containing the mito- chondria was transferred into glass centrifugation tubes fol- lowed by centrifugation (8000 ×g, 10 min at 4 ◦C).The su- pernatant was removed, and the pellet was re-suspended in 5 ml IBM 2 pH 7.4 (25 ml Sucrose (1 M), 3 ml EGTA / Tris (1 M), 1 ml Tris / HCl (1 M) ad.
100 ml ddH 2 O) followed by centrifugation (8000 ×g, 10 min at 4 ◦C) and resuspension of the pellet in an equal volume of IBM 2 . For RNA isolation, samples were further treated with 1 μl Digitonin (Sigma #D141, 10 mg / ml) and 0.5 μl RNase A (Merck #20297, 10 mg / ml).Samples were incubated for 20 min at 27 ◦C.Afterwards samples were centrifuged at 11 000 ×g for 5 min at 4 ◦C.The pellet containing the mitochondria was re-suspended in 700 μl TRIzol and RNA isolation was performed using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen #217004) com- bined with on-column DNase digestion (RNase-Free DNase Set, Qiagen #79254) according to manufacturer’s instruction.Quantification of cardiomyocytes cross sectional area Cryosections of heart tissue were used to determine cardiomy- ocytes cross sectional area.
Hearts were collected after cervi- cal dislocation of animals, were fixed using 4% PFA / PBS (2 h, 4 ◦C) and transferred to 15% sucrose / PBS, 30% sucrose / PBS and Tissue-Tek® O.C.T Compound (94-4583-1; each step overnight, 4 ◦C). Cryosections (10 μm) were prepared using a Leica CM1950, dried (30 min, 21 ◦C) and fixed (4% PFA, 10 min, 21 ◦C).Slides were incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 / PBS (10 min, 21 ◦C) and washed three times using PBS (5 min each).Samples were stained using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA- 488, Thermo #W11261, 1 mg / ml, 1:500 in carrier contain- ing 5% goat serum, 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS; 1 h, 21 ◦C).Sections were incubated using DAPI (Invitrogen #D3571, 2 mg / ml, 1:1000 in PBS, 5 min 21 ◦C), washed three times (PBS, 5 min each), embedded using Fluoromount (Sigma #F4680) and microscopic images were acquired using an Axio Observer (Zeiss).Cross sectional area of cardiomyocytes was determined using blinded samples and manual segmentation in ImageJ.
Numerical binning of cross sectional area was used for statistical analysis. RNA seq, Affymetrix microarrays and RT-qPCR For RNA-seq, RNA was isolated from isolated mitochondria using TRIzol™ (Thermo Scientific #15596026) according to the manufacturer’s instruction, followed by miRNeasy mini Kit (Qiagen #217004) combined with on-column DNase di- gestion (RNase-Free DNase Set, Qiagen #79254).RNA and library preparation integrity were verified with LabChip Gx Touch 24 (Perkin Elmer).10 ng of total RNA was used as in- put for SMARTer® Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit—Pico Input Mammalian (Takara Clontech).Fragmentation time of mito- chondrial samples was adjusted to 1 min according to size of RNA.Sequencing was performed using the NextSeq500 instrument (Illumina) using v2 chemistry, generating a min- imum of 40M reads per library with 1 ×75 bp single end setup.
The resulting raw reads were assessed for quality, adapter content and duplication rates with FastQC ( http:// www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/ projects/ fastqc ). Trim- momatic version 0.39 was employed to trim reads after a quality drop below a mean of Q20 in a window of 5 nu- cleotides ( 34 ).Only reads between 30 and 150 nucleotides were cleared for further analyses.Trimmed and filtered reads were aligned versus the Ensembl mouse genome version mm10 (GRCm38.p5) using STAR 2.7.3a with the parame- ter ‘–outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.1’ to increase the max- imum ratio of mismatches to mapped length to 10% ( 35 ).The number of reads aligning to genes was counted with fea- tureCounts tool from the Subread package 1.6.5 ( 36 ).Only reads mapping at least partially inside exons were admitted and aggregated per gene.Reads overlapping multiple genes 6632 Nucleic Acids Research , 2024, Vol.52, No.11 or aligning to multiple regions were excluded.
Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2 version 1.26.0 ( 37 ). Fold change values and Benjamini–Hochberg corrected P -values were used in a volcano plot.The ENCODE dataset ( 38 ) ENCSR247RPX (doi:10.17989 / ENCSR247RPX) was re-evaluated for analysis of developmental expression of mitolnc.For microarray analysis, RNA was isolated using the TRI- zol method.RNA labelling and hybridization to Affymetrix MTA-1.0 arrays was performed using the GeneChip WT Plus Reagent Kit as per manufacturer’s instructions.Data were an- alyzed using DNAstar ArrayStar with RMA and evaluated using moderated t -test.Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the GSEA desktop software application with Molecular Signatures Database 7.0 ( http://www.gsea- msigdb.org/ gsea/ index.jsp ) with default parameters but using the permutation type gene set.
GSEA determines whether a predefined set of genes shows statistically significant, concor- dant differences between two biological states and thus helps to identify relevant biological processes ( 39 ). RNA for RT-qPCR and TaqMan Gene Expression As- says was isolated from tissue or cells using the TRIzol method.cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of RNA (200 ng of mitochondrial RNA) in combination with the Prime- Script RT-PCR Kit (Takara #RR014B) according to man- ufacturer’s instructions.For qPCR we used the Biozym Blue S´Green qPCR KIT separate ROX (#331416S) and the StepOne™ Real-Time PCR System (Thermo).Sequences of oligonucleotide used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1 .Relative expression was determined using the /Delta1/Delta1Ct calculation.
Alternatively predesigned TaqMan gene expression assays (Thermo) were used (FAM-labeled: BCK- DHA #Mm00476112_m1; BCKDHB #Mm01177077_m1; DBT #Mm00501651_m1; DLD #Mm00432831_m1; BDK #Mm00437777_m1; PPM1K #Mm00615792_m1; ACLY #Mm01302282_m1, GAPDH #Mm999999915_g1 (VIC- labelled, PL)). RNA-FISH RNA-FISH was performed using isolated cardiomyocytes as previously described ( 40 ) using ViewRNA ISH Cell Assay Kit (Affymetrix, #QVC0001) with the probe sets detect- ing mitolnc (#VB1-18013, type1-Alexa546, custom-designed against bases 21–266 of AK079912) and ATP6 (#VB4- 3113886, type4-Alexa488).The experiment was performed according to manufactures instructions on isolated mouse car- diomyocytes which were fixed using 4% PFA / PBS for 10 min at room temperature.RNA–protein pull-down For RNA–protein pull-down experiments mitolnc and con- trol lncRNAs were in vitro transcribed using appropriate DNA T emplates.
T emplates for RNA synthesis were prepared either by digestion of plasmid vectors (MS-based analysis: AK086006, Fantom2-cloneID: D830044D09, BamHI [ctrl I]; AK010044, Fantom2-cloneID: 2310065F04, ScaI [ctrl II]; western blot based analysis: AK013794, Fantom2-cloneID: 2900076A07, Ecl136II [ctrl]) or by PCR using a plasmid (AK079912, Fantom2-cloneID: A530001O10 [mitolnc]) with appropriate oligonucleotides also providing a T7 RNA poly- merase promoter ( Supplementary Table S1 ). In vitro tran- scription was performed using the T7 RiboMAXX™ Express Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega #P1320) ac- cording to the supplier’s protocol, but with extension of tran- scription time to 2 h.For biotinylation of the RNA we used Pierce™RNA 3´End Desthiobiotinylation Kit (Thermo Scien- tific #20163) according to manufacturer’s instructions.RNA- pulldown was performed using the Pierce TM Magnetic RNA- Protein Pull-Down Kit (Thermo Scientific #20164).
For pro- tein extracts of heart tissue, hearts of wildtype mice were chopped in a mortar on dry ice and sonicated in 1 ml RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1x Protease Inhibitor Cock- tail III [Merck #539134], 1 U RNasin [Promega #N2611]). The beads were washed twice with RIPA buffer followed by centrifugation (12 500 rpm, 30 s, 4 ◦C).Interacting proteins were identified by mass spectrometry after off-bead digestion as previously described ( 40 ).Additionally, RNA–protein pull- down was performed using in vitro transcribed RNA and pro- tein extracts of HEK293 cells overexpressing the respective proteins V5 tagged at the C-terminus in combination with western blot analysis.Identification of RNA–protein interaction sites RNA–protein interaction sites were identified following the protocol of Bae et al.( 41 ).Mitochondria were isolated from single hearts as described previously and resuspended in 200 μl storage buffer.
The suspension was exposed to UV irradi- ation at 0.150 J / cm 2 in a 12-well plate, followed by acetone precipitation in 80% acetone at –20 ◦C for 60 min. The pel- let was resuspended in 30 μl 8 M urea / thiourea (6 / 2 M), followed by reduction using 30 mM DTT for 30 min at room temperature.Reduced proteins were alkylated by 55 mM Iodoacetamide (IAA) for 30 min at room temperature in dark.Proteins were cleaved by 0.5 μg sequencing grade LysC (Fuji) for 3 h at room temperature.Samples were di- luted to 2 M urea / thiourea using 100 mM triethylammo- nium bicarbonate (TEAB) and subsequently digested by 0.5 μg sequencing grade trypsin (Serva) over night at room tem- perature.800 μl 48% hydrofluoric acid was added per 5 μg protein, followed by 20 h incubation at room temperature.The samples were dried in a vacuum concentrator, pellets re- suspended in 120 μl 0.5% TFA.Samples were desalted us- ing stage tips and evaporated.Samples were reconstituted in 5 μl buffer A (0.1% formic acid).
3 μl of peptide mixture was injected and analyzed by LC–MS / MS method. Quanti- tative analysis was performed on an Orbitrap Q-exactive HF mass spectrometry system (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an EASY-nLC capillary nano-chromatography system (Thermo Scientific).Extracted peptides were separated on an in-house- made capillary column (150 mm ×1.7 μm ×75 μm) packed with ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ resin (Dr.Maisch).The mo- bile phases were (A) 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% fomic acid (B) 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid.Peptides were separated using a 120 min acetonitrile gradient at room temperature.The mass spectrometer was operated in positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode, and MS / MS data were collected in data dependent analysis mode with a resolution of 60 000 for precursor mass spectra and 15 000 for tandem mass spectra.Normalized collision energy was set to 28 and exclusion time was set to 30 s.Collected data were processed using MSGF+ software.Nucleic Acids Research , 2024, Vol.

Ion source parameters were as follows: CUR 25 psi, CAD medium, Ion Spray Voltage 4500 V, TEM 500 ◦C, GS1 40 psi, GS2 40 psi.Reversed-phase LC separa- tion was performed using an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 μm (2.1 ×75 mm) column.Compounds were eluted with a flow rate of 0.4 ml / min and with the following 10 min gradient: 0– 0.2 min 98% A, 0.2–1 min 55% A, 1–4 min 35% A, 4–4.2 min 0% A, 4.2–7 min 0% A, 7–7.1 min 98% A and 7.1–10 min 98% A.Solvent A consisted of 100% water containing 10 mM ammonium acetate with 1 ml / l Infinity Lab Deactivator Ad- ditive (pH 8.5) and solvent B consisted of acetonitrile / water (9:1, v / v) containing 10 mM ammonium acetate with 1 ml / l Infinity Lab Deactivator Additive (pH 8.5).Column oven tem- perature was set to 35 ◦C, and the autosampler was set to 4 ◦C.
Injection volume was 5 μl. Immunoprecipitation For immunoprecipitation 1 mg protein lysate, 30 μl G- Sepharose-beads (Sigma Aldrich #P3296) and 2 μg of the corresponding antibody were used.For protein extraction hearts were chopped in a mortar on dry ice and sonicated in 1 ml RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 ×protease in- hibitor Cocktail III (Merck #539134, 1 U RNasin [Promega #N2611]).The beads were washed twice using RIPA buffer followed by centrifugation (12 500 rpm, 30 s, 4 ◦C).Beads were blocked with 3% BSA in RIPA Puffer (1 h, 4 ◦C, ro- tating) before incubation with protein lysate and the cor- responding antibody (overnight at 4 ◦C, rotating).Samples were washed three times with RIPA buffer, re-suspended in 100 μl RIPA buffer and finally analyzed by mass spectrome- try.Antibodies used were MCCA (Santa Cruz #Sc-271427), DBT (Sigma #Hpa026485) and anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen 10400c).
For western blot we used anti-mouse IgG Trueblot HRP (Ebioscience #18-8877-31) and anti-rabbit IgG Trueblot HRP (Ebioscience #18-8816-31). BCKDH activity assay The BCKDH activity assay was performed as described previ- ously ( 9 ).Animals were killed and hearts were perfused with PBS pH 7.4.The hearts were collected, weighted and washed twice with ice-cold PBS.Tissue was transferred into Buffer H (30 mM KPi monobasic pH 7.5, 3 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM KIV (Sigma #198994), 3% FCS, 5% Triton X-100, 1 μM Leupeptin (Sigma #L2884) in ddH 2 O) and minced us- ing a pair of scissors.Homogenization was performed using the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi #130-096-427; C-tubes: Miltenyi #130–093-237, mouse tissue mitochondria isolation program).Samples were centrifuged at 10 000 ×g, 10 min at 4 ◦C.
The assays were performed in 24-well plates, whereby 50 μl tissue lysate or 100 μl cell lysate in 300 μl Buffer A (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 30 mM KPi (monobasic) pH 7.5, 0.4 M CoA, 3 mM NAD + (Sigma #N0632-1G), 5% FCS, 2 mM Thiamin pyrophosphate (Sigma #C8754-1G), 2 mM MgCl 2 in ddH 2 O, and 1 μl 14 C-KIV (ARC 3191 Ke- toisovaleric acid, α-[1- 14 C] Na salt) was used. The 14 C-labeled CO 2 was trapped with the help of NaOH (1 M) soaked chro- matin paper which was placed in the lid of the 24-well plate.The reaction took place in a shaking waterbath at 37 ◦C.The reaction was stopped by transferring the plate on ice and adding 100 μl of 70% perchloric acid.After an incubation time of 1 hour the chromatin papers were collected in scin- tillation tubes (6.5 ml, Roth #AYX4.1) and measured using a scintillation counter (Tri-Carb 2810TR Low Activity Liq- uid Scintillation Analyzer, Perkin Elmer).
Activity was nor- malized to tissue weight or cell number respectively as pre- viously described ( 9 ). PCR amplified templates (plasmid tem- plate: AK079912, Fantom2-cloneID: A530001O10 with ap- propriate oligonucleotides providing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter ( Supplementary Table S1 )) for mitolnc and its vari- ants were used to generate RNA to supplement extracts of HEK293 cells or cardiac extracts of mitolnc deficient animals.5 pmol (cardiac extracts) or 50 pmol (HEK293 extracts) of each in vitro transcribed RNA (T7 RiboMaxx™Express large scale RNA Production System, Promega #P1320) lncRNA variant in combination with 1 μl Digitonin (10 mg / ml) was added to Buffer A.In addition, the activity assay was per- formed using lysates of HEK293 and HEP2G cells transfected with plasmids (pcDNA3.1) expressing HIS-V5 tagged ver- sions of mouse BCKDH subunits (BCKDHA, BCKDHB, DBT, DLD) with or without a plasmid expressing mitolnc.
ACLY activity assay For analysis of ACLY activity, tissue extracts of WT and mi- tolnc deficient animals were used. Lysates were freshly pre- pared as described for the IP immediately before starting the assay using modified RIPA (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, Nucleic Acids Research , 2024, Vol.52, No.11 6635 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 ×protease inhibitor cocktail III (Merck #539134, 1 U RNasin (Promega #N2611)), 1 x phosSTOP TM (Merck #4906845001).Lysates containing 100 μg of protein were used for the ACLY Assay Kit (Bioscience #79904) according to manufacturer’s instructions.Sucrose density gradient centrifugation To analyze the complex stability and density we performed sucrose gradient centrifugation using protein lysates of WT and KO animal hearts as described ( 43 ).Protein lysates were prepared as described for IP using modified RIPA (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl: 1% NP40; 0.25% sodium deoxy- cholate, pH 7.4 with HCl).
Protein lysates (1 mg / 300 μl) were added on top of a sucrose gradient (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40% sucrose). Samples were centrifuged at 38 300 rpm (250 000 ×g; 16 h, 4 ◦C, Beckman coulter op- tima L30K; rotor: SW41).Thirteen single fractions were col- lected and proteins were isolated using a final concentration of 7.5% TCA for 4 h at 4 ◦C, followed by 5 min centrifuga- tion at 16 000 ×g.Protein pellets were washed twice using 100% acetone followed by 5 min centrifugation at 16 000 × g.Proteins were resuspended in loading buffer and analyzed by western blot.The blots were developed using identical ex- posure times per target for both genotypes respectively.Analysis of coding potential and co-localization For in silico analysis of the coding potential of lncRNAs including mitolnc the tool Coding Potential Calculator 2 (CPC2) was used ( http:// cpc2.gao-lab.org/ ).
Sequences of mi- tolnc and previously described lncRNAs Nron, Hotair, the mi- cropeptide encoding RNAs Dworf and Myoregulin as well as the protein-coding RNAs of Acta1 and Gapdh were used. Additionally potential open reading frames were compared to known proteins using the BLAST tool.Fluorescence mi- croscopy images taken from RNA FISH experiments were an- alyzed for co-localization of signals for mitolnc and atp6 us- ing the coloc2 tool of ImageJ / Fuji with autothreshold.The co- localization coefficient tM1 was used to quantify how many of the pixels detected in channel 2 (mitolnc - red) are co-localized with the detected objects in channel 1 (ATP6 – green).Thereby, 100% of overlap of the signal corresponds to a value of 1 ( 44 ).Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism V9.Data were tested for normal distribution and Student’s t -test or the Mann–Whitney test were used accordingly.
For mul- tiple comparison the Fisher LSD test was used in the course of a two-way Anova multivariance analysis. Data are repre- sented as mean ±SEM.In case of multiple data points data are represented as Box and Whiskers with the box extend- ing from the 25th to 75th percentiles, the whiskers are drawn from the 10th percentile to the 90th percentile and points below and above are represented by single data points.Sta- tistical significances were reported as P -values.For evalua- tion of proteomics or transcriptomics the data were normal- ized accordingly.Z -scores were calculated for visualization of data.Results Identification of a cardiac, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial localized lncRNA To identify lncRNAs with potential functions in cardiac mitochondria, we extracted RNA from isolated mitochon- dria and the non-mitochondrial fraction of adult mouse hearts.
Comparison of RNA sequencing data for each frac- tion, followed by filtering for lncRNAs annotated in the En- sembl genome database, identified lncRNAs enriched in mito- chondria. The lncRNA GM44386 (AK079912), subsequently named mitolnc, was selected for further analysis (Figure 1 A, Supplementary Figure S1 A), since nothing is known about its function in the heart, although expression of mitolnc in brown adipose tissue and a role in adipogenesis has been reported before ( 45 ,46 ).Fractionation of adult mouse cardiomyocytes in combination with RT-qPCR demonstrated the localization of mitolnc outside the nuclei (Figure 1 B) and RT-qPCR using additional fractionation of heart tissue corroborated localiza- tion inside the mitochondrial fraction (Figure 1 C).Mitolnc is encoded at mouse chromosome 6qD1 and predominantly expressed in the adult heart, brown adipose tissue (BAT), ox- idative skeletal muscle, and kidney.
Much weaker or virtually no expression of mitolnc was seen in the liver, brain, lung and spleen (Figure 1 D, Supplementary Figure S1 B). Mitolnc is de- tected at lower levels in embryonic compared to adult hearts ( Supplementary Figure S1 C), which corresponds to the lower numbers of mitochondria in immature cardiomyocytes.Bioin- formatic analysis confirmed mitolnc to be ncRNA without any conserved ORF ( Supplementary Figure S1 D).To investigate the molecular and physiological functions of mitolnc, we generated two different mitolnc-deficient mouse models either by deleting the mitolnc locus or by inserting a polyA cassette.Deletion of the complete mitolnc locus, result- ing in a complete null mutation, was achieved using a CAS9- nickase approach, which reduces potential off-target effects of CAS9 ( 30 ).
Insertion of the polyA cassette in the first exon by CAS9 also inactivated the mitolnc gene, eliminating all de- tectable mitolnc expression without affecting expression of the neighboring PCBP1 gene ( Supplementary Figure S2 A–H). Both mouse lines were viable showing a Mendelian distri- bution of offspring, without any obvious developmental ab- normalities, including normal adipogenesis ( Supplementary Figure S2 I–M).RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization us- ing adult mouse cardiomyocytes and probes directed against mitolnc and the mitochondrial encoded ATP6 corroborated the presence of mitolnc in cardiac mitochondria.No mitolnc signals were detected in mitolnc-deficient cardiomyocytes, demonstrating specificity of the probes (Figure 1 E, F).
Deletion of mitolnc expression induces cardiac h ypertroph y in adult animals Although inactivation of mitolnc does not cause obvious de- velopmental defects in either mouse model and heart weights were normal at 8 weeks of age ( Supplementary Figure S2 K), we noted increased heart weights in both mitolnc deficient mouse models at 16 weeks of age (Figure 2 A, Supplementary Figure S2 L, M). In line with this finding, histological analy- sis of cardiac tissue at 16 weeks of age revealed an increase of the cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes (Figure 2 B, C).Unbiased examination of transcriptome data by gene set en- richment analysis ( 39 ) using KEGG gene sets revealed en- richment of gene sets specific for BCAA catabolism, fatty 6636 Nucleic Acids Research , 2024, Vol.52, No.11 Figure 1.Mitolnc is a nuclear-encoded lincRNA found in mitochondria.( A ) RNA isolated from mitochondria and of remaining heart lysate analyzed by RNA-Seq.

The non-coding RNA mitolinc (Gm44386, AK079912) was highly enriched in mitochondria.( B ) RT-qPCR using nuclear and extranuclear fractions of isolated cardiomyocytes.Ratio for (cell-nucleus) / nucleus normalized to the ratio of Gapdh is shown ( n = 5 animals, extranuclear and nuclear fractions; mean values ±SEM).( C ) RT-qPCR using mitochondrial fraction and complete heart lysate.Ratio for mitochondria / whole cell normalized to the ratio of Cox1 is shown (Cox1: n = 5 animals; mitolnc, Neat1, beta-actin: n = 6 animals; mean values ±SEM).( D ) RT-qPCR for mitolnc in different tissues of the mouse ( n = 3–4 animals).( E , F ) RNA FISH using probes against mitolnc and Atp6 detect the RNAs outside of the nucleus.The mitolinc signal is lost in mitolnc deficient cardiomyocytes.
Co-localization analysis confirms co-localization of mitolnc and Atp6 RNA. Scale bar in d corresponds to 10 μm.acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 2 D).Mitolnc-deficient hearts showed increased gene expression of all three gene sets (Figure 2 E–G).Next, we investigated the cardiac metabolome to learn whether the transcriptional changes in mitolnc-deficient hearts are also associated with metabolic changes.Importantly, we observed substantially in- creased concentrations of all three branched chain amino acids and of α-ketoglutarate, which is probably caused via al- losteric activation of GDH by leucine (Figure 2 H).Increased concentrations of leucine are known to acti- vate mTOR signaling, the latter being a well-characterized pathway in the induction of cardiac hypertrophy ( 1 , 15 , 47 ).
To confirm activation of mTOR signaling in mitolnc de- ficient hearts as a consequence of elevated leucine levels, we performed a western blot analysis, which uncovered in- creased p-mTOR (Ser2448) and p -4E-BP1 (Thr37 / 46) con- centrations in mitolnc-deficient compared to WT hearts (Fig- ure 3 A–C). To corroborate the causal relation between in- creased BCAA levels and activation of mTOR signaling, WT mice were fed with a BCAA-rich chow, which increased BCAA serum levels ( Supplementary Figure S3 A, B), and also in- creased phosphorylation of mTOR at serine2448 in hearts ( Supplementary Figure S3 C, D).Next, we inhibited mTOR signaling in mitolnc-deficient hearts by administration of ra- pamycin.
Suppression of mTOR signaling abrogated differ- ences in heart weight between WT and mitolnc deficient an- imals, demonstrating that leucine-dependent mTOR activa- tion is responsible for induction of cardiac hypertrophy in mutant animals, although additional mechanisms contribut- ing to cardiac hypertrophy cannot be ruled out (Figure 3 D–H, Supplementary Figure S3 E–G). Mitolnc expression is also detected in BAT and skeletal muscle, where its localization is confined to mitochondria of adipocytes and skeletal muscle myofibers, similar as in cardiomyocytes ( Supplementary Figure S4 A, B).Transcrip- tome analysis of BAT revealed an enrichment of gene sets related to BCAA and fatty acid metabolism ( Supplementary Figure S4 C–E), but no significant changes in BCAA Nucleic Acids Research , 2024, Vol.52, No.11 6637 Figure 2.Mitolnc pre v ents cardiac h ypertroph y and controls BCAA catabolism.

Mitolnc interacts with essential enzymes of the BCAA catabolism To gain insights how the loss of mitolnc increases the con- centration of cardiac BCAAs, we searched for proteins poten- tially interacting with mitolnc by RNA–protein pull-down as- says using in vitro synthesized lncRNAs coupled to biotin and incubated with cardiac protein lysates. To control for non- specific interactions between RNAs and proteins in this as- say, we included two additional control-lncRNAs.RNA inter- acting proteins were identified by mass-spectrometry, reveal- ing specific interactions of mitolnc with components of the BCKDH complex (Figure 4 A).The BCKDH complex medi- ates the first irreversible step in the catabolism of BCAAs by decarboxylation of BCAA-derived ketoacids.Reduced activity of the BCKDH complex leads to accumulation of BCAAs and causes maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) ( 3 ).
To confirm the interaction between mitolnc and components of the BCKDH complex, we used mitolnc to pull down V5-tagged BCKDH complex components expressed in HEK293 cells, followed by western blot analysis. We detected interactions of mitolnc with the E1 subunits of the BCKDH complex, comprising BCK- DHA and BCKDHB, as well as interactions with the E2 / E3 subunits DBT and DLD (Figure 4 B).Nucleic Acids Research , 2024, Vol.52, No.11 6639 Figure 4.Mitolnc controls the catabolic flux of BCAAs by interacting with BCKDHA.( A ) RNA–protein pull-down using in vitro transcribed mitolnc and protein extracts isolated from heart combined with MS analysis of the bound proteins identifies proteins specifically pulled down by mitolnc (mitolnc + two ctrl-lncRNAs (AK086006; AK080188: lnc-myh), technical triplicates each, z -score of a v eraged detection values).

rISH-PLA revealed signals outside of the nucleus of isolated adult cardiomyocytes when antibodies against the BCKDHA subunit of E1 together with antibodies against hybridized mitolnc-specific probes were used (Figure 4 D, E). In line with the mitochondrial localization of mitolnc and BCKDH, rISH- PLA signals overlapped with MitoTracker Deep Red staining ( Supplementary Figure S5 A-C).In contrast, no signals were obtained when antibodies against DBT, the E2 component of the BCKDH complex, were employed in this assay, which is in conflict with the results from the pull-down experiments (Figure 4 D, E).We reason that the increased concentration of DBT due to overexpression facilitates its indirect pull-down by mitolnc via interaction with BCKDHA, whereas rISH-PLA is done in a physiological setting, avoiding such artefacts and detecting more specifically proximity of the molecules.
For further analysis of the BCKDH–mitolnc interaction, we investigated direct RNA–protein contacts by comparing pro- tein extracts of UV-crosslinked mitochondria isolated from WT and mitolnc −/ −hearts followed by hydrofluoric acid treatment and mass spectrometry (HF-MS). After isolation of the cross-linked RNA–protein complexes, phosphodiester bonds of the RNA were cleaved using hydrofluoric acid, which leaves a crosslinked uridine residue of the RNA at pep- tides ( 41 ).Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis identified a uridine-modified, BCKDHA-derived peptide only in WT but not in mitolnc −/ −protein extracts ( Supplementary Figure S5 D–F), further corroborating the interaction of mitolnc with mitochondrial BCKDHA in vivo .The analysis also indicated that the interaction of mitolnc with BCKDHA occurs at a site close to essential BCKDHA cofactor binding and regulatory phosphorylation.
To further characterize the interaction of mitolnc and BCKDH complex, we analyzed several mutants of BCKDHA and mitolnc. We found that a part of the first exon of mi- tolnc, including a sequence motif conserved between mouse and human ( Supplementary Figure S1 B), is essential and suffi- cient for the interaction with BCKDHA.In contrast, RNA se- quence downstream of the conserved sequence motif in exon 1 and sequences in exon 2 are dispensable for the interaction with BCKDHA (Figure 4 F).We found that the first 192 aa of BCKDHA are not essential for the interaction with mitolnc, whereas deletion of the protein domain containing the peptide identified by HF-MS (del5, Figure 4 G, H) as well as deletion of the BCKDHA cofactor binding sites abolishes BCKDH- mitolnc interactions.
Loss of mitolnc reduces the activity of BCKDC and ACLY in cardiomyocytes The accumulation of BCAAs in the heart of mitolnc-deficient mice made it likely that mitolnc is required to achieve high enzymatic activity of BCKDH. To directly test this possibil- ity, we determined the activity of the BCKDH complex in WT and mitolnc-deficient heart tissue.We used an assay in which the release of 14 C from 14 C labelled ketoacid of va- line α-keto [1- 14 C] isovalerate ( 14 C KIV) is employed to mea- sure the activity of the BCKDH complex (Figure 5 A) ( 9 ).We observed a significant reduction of BCKDH complex ac- tivity in mitolnc-deficient compared to WT control hearts (Figure 5 B), despite equal protein levels of BCKDH com- plex components ( Supplementary Figure S6 ).Loss of mitolnc might reduce BCKDH complex activity due to various rea- sons, including changes in the subcellular localization of the BCKDH complex or alteration of posttranslational modifica- tions.
First, we tested whether mitolnc affects the transport of BCKDH complex components. Subcellular fractionation, fol- lowed by western blot analysis of the different fractions did not reveal any differences in the mitochondrial localization of BCKDH complex components between WT controls and mitolnc-deficient hearts ( Supplementary Figure S6 ).Next, we analyzed changes in the phosphorylation of BCKDH, since its activity is suppressed by phosphorylation at Ser293 of BCK- DHA (Figure 5 A).Surprisingly, we observed decreased phos- phorylation of BCKDHA in mitolnc-deficient hearts (Figure 5 C, D), although decreased phosphorylation normally indi- cates high enzymatic activity of the BCKDH complex.Phosphorylation of BCKDHA is accomplished by the branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BDK) and counteracted by the protein phosphatase 1K (PPM1K), which dephosphorylates BCKDHA to increase its activity.
We found that the reduced phosphorylation of BCKDHA by BDK is not associated with changes in the abundance of BDK or PPM1K, as indicated by western blots analysis (Figure 5 E, F), but most likely caused by allosteric inhibition of BDK via α- ketoisocaproate (KIC) derived from increased concentrations of leucine. KIC accumulates upon increase of leucine and rep- resents an important component of the feedback loop, ac- tivating BCKDH to cope with an increased load of BCAAs ( 48 ,49 ).The results also underscore the importance of mitolnc for achieving high BCKDH complex activity, since BCKDH complex activity was low in mitolnc-deficient hearts, despite massive dephosphorylation of BCKDHA.Interestingly, we also detected decreased phosphorylation of the ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) (Figure 5 G, H), required for cytosolic generation of acetyl-CoA for de novo lipogenesis but also for epigenetic regulation through histone acetylation ( 50 ).
ACLY was recently described to be co-regulated by the BDK / PPM1K system to allow integration of BCAA and lipid metabolism ( 9 ). In line with the lowered phosphorylation of ACLY, we found strongly decreased ACLY activity in cardiac lysates (Figure 5 I).We also observed an inverse correlation between expression of mitolnc and PPM1K / BDK / ACLY in some tissues, suggesting that activation of BCAA catabolism by mitolnc primarily happens in tissues, in which expression of components of the BDK / PPM1K / ACLY regulon is compar- atively low (Figure 5 J).In conclusion, the decreased activity of ACLY in mitolnc-deficient hearts may reflect the requirement of some cell types to regulate BCKDH complex activity in- dependently of BDK and PPM1K, i.e.to stimulate activity of the BCKDH complex independent of BDK, thereby avoiding direct effects on ACLY.
Mitolnc allosterically activates the BCKDH complex We found that mitolnc does neither affect mitochondrial local- ization of the BCKDH complex nor increase repressive phos- phorylation of BCKDHA, which leaves a role of mitolnc in the assembly of the BCKDH complex or a direct function as allosteric activator as potential modes of action. To analyze whether loss of mitolnc affects composition of the BCKDH complex, we immunoprecipitated the BCKDH complex from heart lysates of WT and mitolnc-deficient hearts using Nucleic Acids Research , 2024, Vol.52, No.11 6641 Figure 5.Regulation of BCAA metabolism by mitolnc is independent of phosphorylation.( A ) Schematic representation of BCKDH complex activity and regulation.

We added in vitro transcribed mitolnc to cardiac extracts of mitolnc deficient mice and observed a significant increase in BCKDH complex activity, whereas addition of mutant vari- ants of mitolnc did not have any effects (Figure 6 A, B). More- over, we expressed the BCKDH complex either with mitolnc or its mutant variants in HEK293 and Hep2G cells.Inclusion of full length mitolnc increased activity of the BCKDH com- plex in HEK293 and Hep2G cells, which normally do not express mitolnc (Figure 6 C, D).We also detected increased BCKDH complex activity when adding in vitro transcribed mitolnc to extracts of HEK293 cells (Figure 6 E), conclusively demonstrating that mitolnc directly enhances the enzymatic activity of the BCKDH complex.Since HEK293 are of hu- man origin, these results also indicate that the mechanism of lncRNA-dependent enzyme activation is conserved between species.To corroborate the hypothesis that mitolnc acts by 6642 Nucleic Acids Research , 2024, Vol.52, No.

Nucleic Acids Research , 2024, Vol. 52, No.11 6643 direct allosteric activation of BCKDH, probably by changing conformation of the complex, we analyzed fractions of su- crose density gradients loaded with extracts from WT and mitolnc deficient hearts.The BCKDHA and DLD subunits of the BCKDH complex were detected in the same fractions of the gradient when comparing WT and mitolnc-deficient hearts.However, absence of mitolnc shifted the localization of BCKDHA and DLD subunits to a different fraction with lower density (Figure 6 F, G), suggesting changes in protein conformation.Discussion Here, we describe the unexpected function of the long non- coding RNA mitolnc as an allosteric activator of the mito- chondrial BCKDH complex and its role in regulating car- diac metabolism.We found that allosteric activation of the BCKDH complex by mitolnc is critical to reduce local concen- trations of leucine in cardiomyocytes, thereby preventing un- wanted mTOR activation and cardiac hypertrophy.
Our work discloses a previously unknown mechanism of BCKDH com- plex regulation that allows control of BCAA catabolism in- dependent of BDK / PPM1K-mediated control of phosphory- lation of BCKDHA, essentially decoupling BCCA catabolism from generation of citrate-derived acetyl-CoA by ACLY. BDK / PPM1K-dependent phosphorylation of BCKDHA is high in the heart, suggesting inhibition of BCKDH complex enzyme activity, despite the high oxidative flux of BCAA ( 51 ), which is difficult to understand.Availability of substrates, con- centration of reaction products as well as allosteric regula- tion of BCAA decarboxylation has been discussed to explain this obvious contradiction, but no convincing explanation was provided.Here, we offer a solution for this conundrum by identifying mitolnc as an allosteric activator of the BCKDH complex, independent of its phosphorylation status.
Mitolnc expression is highest in the heart, exactly the organ in which an allosteric activator is needed to counteract BDK-mediated phosphorylation, resulting in suppression of BCKDH com- plex activity. Interestingly, BDK and the corresponding phosphatase PPM1K also control activity of ACLY and potentially other metabolic enzymes ( 9 ).ACLY is part of the citrate-malate shuttle, transferring acetyl-CoA from mitochondria to the cy- toplasm.In contrast to BCKDHA, phosphorylation of ACLY by BDK-mediated phosphorylation increases ACLY activ- ity, coupling BCAA metabolism with cytosolic generation of acetyl-CoA and fatty acid synthesis.Under homeostatic con- ditions de novo lipogenesis does not play an important role in heart physiology but becomes a critical limiting factor during the stress of acute pressure overload and aging ( 52 ).
More- over , ACL Y plays a pivotal role for supplying acetyl-CoA, re- quired for epigenetic regulation of cardiomyocytes through histone acetylation ( 50 ), which is particularly important for the control of cardiac growth during development and for stress-dependent cardiac remodelling ( 53 ). The regulation of BCKDH complex activity by mitolnc avoids the cross-talk to ACLY by uncoupling control of enzyme activity from phos- phorylation, thus promoting a high activity of the BCKDH complex to remove high concentrations of BCAAs, even un- der conditions when a high activity of ACLY is required.The importance to keep BCAA concentrations in cardiomyocytes low becomes apparent from the development of cardiac hy- pertrophy in mitolnc-deficient mice but also after feeding large amounts of BCAAs.Apparently, the requirement for uncoupling BCKDHA phosphorylation from ACLY activity differs between different organs, which is reflected by the tissue-specific expression of mitolnc.
Our work indicates that organs have to cope with in- creased BCAA loads locally by adjusting catabolic pathways. We found that reduction of the BCKDH complex activity in mitolnc-deficient mice resulted in a local increase of BCAA concentrations in the heart, without an increase in the serum of mitolnc-deficient mice, which seems to exclude export of BCAAs from cardiomyocytes as a means to lower BCAA con- centrations in the heart.We also noted an inverse correlation of the two molecules that activate the BCKDH complex by different mechanisms.Mitolnc is highly expressed in heart, brown adipose tissue, oxidative skeletal muscle, and kidney, whereas expression of PPM1K is lower in these tissues but much stronger in the liver, spleen, lung and brain, indicating organ-specific requirements.So far, we did not identify regula- tory stimuli that change expression of mitolnc.
Further work is needed to understand whether mitolnc contributes to the dynamic adjustment of BCKDH activity under different dis- ease or metabolic conditions. In contrast to the tissue-specific activation of the BCKDH complex evoked by mitolnc, the reg- ulation of BCKDHA phosphorylation by BDK followed an es- tablished pattern.The increase of BCAAs in mitolnc-deficient hearts most likely reduces phosphorylation of BCKDHA at Ser293 ( 4 , 54 , 55 ), to increase enzyme activity.The reduced phosphorylation of BCKDHA is clearly part of a compen- satory cellular response to increase enzyme activity caused by accumulation of BCAAs.Concentrations of BCAAs were in equilibrium with the corresponding branched chain ketoacids (BCKAs) due to the reversible BCAT-mediated transamina- tion, which explains the increase of BCAAs, although BCKAs and not BCAAs are the direct substrates of the BCKDH com- plex.
The identification of mitolnc as an allosteric activator of the mitochondrial BCKDH complex was a surprise but not com- pletely unexpected. LncRNAs serve multiple different roles ranging from functions in chromatin and transcriptional con- trol to the regulation of protein complex assembly.Many lncRNAs are retained in the nucleus but some are trans- ported to different subcellular structures, suggesting specific functions at these sites ( 24 ).Localization of nuclear encoded lncRNA in mitochondria is not common and we are not aware of another published lncRNA that is located in cardiac mito- chondria, although some examples of mitochondrially local- ized lncRNAs exist for other cell types ( 25 ,26 ).The mecha- nisms enabling transfer of lncRNAs are not understood very well but described to be supported by the polynucleotide phos- phorylase (PNPASE) located at the mitochondrial intermem- brane space ( 56 ).
RNA sequence elements essential for the import of RNA into mitochondria have been identified ( 56 ), but no consensus sequence motif is known that is necessary and sufficient for RNA import into mitochondria. The abun- dance of some mitochondrial localized lncRNAs depends on the RNA binding protein GRSF1, located in the mitochon- drial matrix ( 25 ).Our data demonstrate localization of mi- tolnc within mitochondria and establish functional interaction with the BCKDH complex in the mitochondrial matrix.At present, we do not know how mitolnc enters mitochondria, i.e.whether the import happens concomitant with the transport of BCKDH complex components, independently via known 6644 Nucleic Acids Research , 2024, Vol.52, No.11 mitochondrial transporters, or by novel pathways.In the heart of mitolnc deficient animals we observe cardiac hypertrophy and increase of BCCAs.
Attenuation of BCAA-induced mTOR activity by treatment with rapamycin prevented cardiac hyper- trophy and restored a normal phenotype in mitolnc-deficient animals. These data strongly suggest -together with the local- ization of mitolnc in mitochondria- that the role of mitolnc is restricted to the regulation of BCKDH, although we do not want to exclude potential other functions.Our results provide striking evidence that mitolnc directly stimulates BCKDH activity by an allosteric mechanism.We excluded indirect effects, such as an impact on the mito- chondrial localization of BCKDH complex components and changes in the composition of the complex.Addition of mi- tolnc to extracts isolated from mitolnc deficient hearts or HEK293 cells increased the activity of the respective BCKDH complex, which in our view is a strong argument for allosteric activation.
It might still be argued that mitolnc recruits or re- pels an unknown protein not detected in our IP experiments, which alters BCKDH complex activity, although we consider such a scenario unlikely. Moreover, we found that the presence of mitolnc changes migration of the BCKDH complex in su- crose gradients, probably by changing conformation and den- sity of complex components.Finally, analysis of mutant BCK- DHA subunits indicates that mitolnc closely interacts with the active center of the BCKDH complex core subunit BCK- DHA.Future structural studies of the BCKDH complex in presence or absence of mitolnc using cryoEM or similar tech- niques might reveal more exhaustive insights into the molec- ular mechanism of the mitolnc-BCKDH interaction.Expression and function of mitolnc were analyzed in Mus musculus .
The human genome contains syntenic sequence el- ements conserved between mouse and human and this con- served sequence corresponds to the first exon of mouse mi- tolnc that is important for the interaction with BCKDHA. However, we have not been able to detect mitolnc RNA ex- pression in humans, which might be due to technical limita- tions.Importantly, we demonstrated that mitolnc increases ac- tivity of the BCKDH complex in extracts of human HEK293 cells, clearly indicating that the regulatory principle exploited by mouse mitolnc is active in humans too.It also seems pos- sible that the transcript of mouse mitolnc was not conserved in humans but was replaced by another lncRNA with a differ- ent primary sequence but similar conformation, still allowing allosteric activation of human BCKDH complex.
Even if a hu- man homologue of mitolnc does not exist, because of differ- ent physiological needs and divergent evolution of mammals, the ability to change enzymatic activity of human BCKDH complex by lncRNAs is clearly conserved. Thus, it will be possible to use lncRNAs for manipulation of aberrant BCAA metabolism in humans, which contributes to heart failure and other cardiac diseases in numerous contexts ( 1 ).Data availability RNA-Seq data were submitted to NCBI GEO ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo #GSE235581, GSE235759 and GSE235762.Microarray data were submitted to the ArrayExpress ( http: // www.ebi.ac.uk/ biostudies/ #E-MT AB- 13047, #E-MT AB- 13048.Mass spectrometry data were submitted to Pro- teomeXchange (RNA–protein pulldown: #PXD044737; IP: PXD044819; HF-MS: PXD049691).Supplementary data Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.A c kno wledg ements We thank K.Richter, S.Thomas, S.Krüger, S.Jeratsch and S.Kreutzer for technical help.
