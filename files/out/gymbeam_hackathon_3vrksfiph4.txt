Received January 29, 2024; accepted March 5, 2024 ABSTRACT Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the major site of vitamin A (retinol) esterification and subsequent storage as retinyl esters within lipid droplets.However, retinyl esters become depleted in many patho-physiological states, including acute and chronic liver injuries.
Re-cently, using a liver slice culture system as a model of acute liver injury and fibrogenesis, a time-dependent increase and decrease in the apparent formation of the bioactive retinoid all- trans -retinoic acid ( atRA) and retinyl palmitate was measured, respectively. This coincided with temporal changes in the gene expression of retinoid- metabolizing enzymes and binding proteins, that preceded HSCactivation.However, the underlying mechanisms that promote early changes in retinoid metabolism remain unresolved.We hypothesized that LX-2 cells could be applied to investigate differences in quiescentand activated HSC retinoid metabolism.We demonstrate that thehypermetabolic state of activated stellate cells relative to quiescent stellate cells may be attributed to induction of STRA6 ,RBP4 ,a n d CYP26A1 , thereby reducing intracellular concentrations of atRA.
We further hypothesized that paracrine and autocrine cytokine signaling regulates HSC vitamin A metabolism in both quiescent and activatedcells. In quiescent cells, tumor necrosis factor adose-dependently down- regulated LRAT andCRBP1 mRNA, with EC 50values of 30 –50 pg/mL.Likewise, interleukin-1 bdecreased LRAT andCRBP1 gene expression but with less potency.In activated stellate cells, multiple enzymes weredownregulated, suggesting that the full effects of altered hepatic vitamin A metabolism in chronic conditions require both paracrine and autocrine signaling events.Further, this study suggests the potential for cell type – specific autocrine effects in hepatic retinoid signaling.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT HSCs are the major site of vitamin A storage and important determi- nants of retinol metabolism during liver fibrogenesis.
Here, two LX-2 culture methods were applied as models of hepatic retinoid metabo-lism to demonstrate the effects of activation status and dose-depen-dent cytokine exposure on the expression of genes involved in retinoid metabolism. This study suggests that compared to quiescent cells, activated HSCs are hypermetabolic and have reduced apparentformation of retinoic acid, which may alter downstream retinoic acid signaling.Introduction Vitamin A is an essential fat-soluble vitamin obtained from the diet and stored in the liver as retinyl esters.Vitamin A signaling is attributed to the transcriptionally active metabolite of retinol, all- trans -retinoic acid ( atRA).atRA is an integral regulator of lipid metabolism (Chen and Chen, 2014), fatty acid oxidation (Zhao et al., 2012), gluconeogene- sis (Obrochta et al., 2015), and extracellular matrix remodeling (Ye and Dan, 2010).
atRA exerts its transcriptional effects through activation of the retinoic acid receptors (RAR)- a,R A R b,a n dR A R c(Huang et al.,2014). The transcriptional activity is dependent on atRA concentrations, which are regulated by a complement of enzymes and binding proteins(Fig.1).Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) esterify retinol to retinyl esters (REs) by lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) and store REs in lipid droplets.HSCs also support circulating retinol concentrations throughthe mobilization of REs via retinyl ester hydrolases.Retinol is secretedinto systemic circulation from the hepatocytes bound to retinol-bindingprotein (RBP)-4 (Blaner et al., 2016).In cells, retinol oxidation to reti-naldehyde is reversible and involves retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs),short-chain dehydrogenase reductases (DHRS) (Kedishvili, 2016; Be- lyaeva et al., 2020), and CYP1B1 (Chen et al., 2000).
Retinaldehydeoxidation to atRA is irreversible and in human liver is mediated mainly by aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs; ALDH1A1) and, to a lesser extent, aldehyde oxidase (AOX) (Zhong et al., 2021). Clear-ance of atRA is primarily attributed to the CYP26 family of en- zymes, but other cytochrome P450s can also oxidize atRA in human liver (Isoherranen and Zhong, 2019).Vitamin A metabolome is altered in acute and chronic liver injury (Zhong et al., 2019b; Czuba et al., 2021).Yet, the exact mechanisms This work was supported by National Institutes of Health National Institute of General Medical Sciences [Grant 5R01GM111772-06] (to N.I.) and National In-stitute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [Grant 5T32DK007247-42] (to L.C.C.).N.I.is supported in part by the Milo Gibaldi Endowed Chair for the Department of Pharmaceutics.The authors declare that they have no competing interests that in ﬂuenced the work or its ﬁndings.dx.doi.org/10.1124/dmd.124.001679.

perpetrating vitamin A dysregulation in humans are unknown, and the consequences of altered atRA concentrations to retinoid signaling in the liver are not well characterized. In rodent models, activation of HSCs isassociated with downregulation of LRAT mRNA and protein, mobiliza- tion of REs, and depletion of hepatic vitamin A stores (D ’Ambrosio et al., 2011; Kida et al., 2011).In a human liver slice model, altered vi-tamin A metabolic activity preceded HSC activation and collagen depo-sition (Wu et al., 2018; Czuba et al., 2021).Within 12 –24 hours of tissue slicing, LRAT , cellular retinol-binding protein ( CRBP )-1,RBP4 , and the retinol transporter STRA6 mRNAs were signi ﬁcantly downregu- lated in all donors tested.This coincided with a transient peak in tissueatRA concentrations.Kinetic modeling suggested that a combination of changes in retinoid-metabolizing enzyme activity was responsible forthe peak (Czuba et al., 2021).
Consistent with these ﬁndings, treatment of primary mouse HSCs with lipopol ysaccharide (LPS) reduced RA cell concentrations, altered RAR signaling, and downregulated CRBP1 gene expression (Chen et al., 2017). Taken together, these data point tothe critical role of vitamin A metabolic machinery in HSCs and to theimportance of retinoid signaling in ﬁbrosis.Yet, better model systems are needed to explore the mechanisms regulating vitamin A metabolismin human HSCs.Stellate cells, including the immortalized stellate cell line LX-2, re- tain cytokine signaling and express the major receptors for interleukin(IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- aand IL-1 bin culture (Xu et al., 2005; Tarrats et al., 2011; Harvey et al., 2013).TNF- a,I L - 1 b, and IL-6 are implicated in the early stages of liver injury, wound response and re-generation, and initiation of ﬁbrogenesis (Tanaka and Miyajima, 2016).
The secretion of soluble cytokines and signaling is elevated in many hu-man conditions where vitamin A metabolome is also altered, includingobesity (Trasino et al., 2015), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Saeedet al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2019b), alcoholic hepatitis (Ferdouse et al., 2022), and chronic kidney disease (Jing et al., 2016). In the human liver slice model, early changes to hepatic vitamin A metabolism parallel thetime course of notable paracrine signals, including cytokines (Wu et al.,2018).Treatment of rat HSCs with IL-1 and TNF- aled to downregula- tion of LRAT mRNA expression (Kida et al., 2011).However, it is un- known if exposure to soluble cytokines promotes dysregulation atmultiple steps of the vitamin A pathway as implicated by kinetic model-ing.Here, we hypothesized that TNF- a,I L - 1 b, and IL-6 regulate the mRNA expression of hepatic retinoid-metabolizing enzymes.
We usedthe immortalized stellate cell line LX-2 as a model system to investigatethe expression of vitamin A –metabolizing enzymes in “quiescent ”and “activated ”stellate cells. We then tested whether TNF- a,I L - 1 b,a n d IL-6 regulate the mRNA expression of key genes in the vitamin A met-abolic pathway.Materials and Methods Chemicals and Reagents.Human-derived (HumanKine) TNF- a,I L - 1 b,a n d IL-6 were purchased from MilliporeSigma (Burlington, MA).Human serum albu-min, all -trans- retinoic acid, all -trans- retinol, retinyl acetate, acitretin, LPS, and TRI Reagent were purchased from MilliporeSigma.Retinyl palmitate and 13- cis-retinoic acid were from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario).atRA-d 6, retinol-d 6, and retinyl palmitate-d 4were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Tewksbury, MA).
Ethanol and Optima liquid chromatography/mass spectrome- try (LC/MS)-grade water, acetonitrile (ACN), and formic acid were purchasedfrom ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc (Waltham, MA). Gibco brand Dulbecco ’s modi ﬁed Eagle ’s medium (DMEM; high glucose), charcoal-stripped FBS, penicillin- streptomycin (10,000 U/mL), Dulbecco ’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), trypsin, and GlutaMAX were from ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc.Cell Culture Conditions for Quiescent and Activated Stellate Cells.The immortalized hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 (MilliporeSigma), derived from isolated stellate cells from a single donor and cultured under low serum condi-tions, was used (Xu et al., 2005).Cells were cultured in DMEM with 2% char- coal stripped FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% GlutaMAX.
Passages 3–10 were used for experiments, and during the experimental phase of research, the LX-2 cell line was authenticated by submitting cell samples to the American Type Culture Collection for short-tandem repeat analysis. To promote an activated hepatic stellate cell phenotype, LX-2 cells were seeded at a density of 2 to 3 × 10 5cells per well to a 12-well tissue culture – treated plastic plate.These cells are referred to as activated cells due to the previ- ously established phenotype based on the expression of asmooth muscle actin (aSMA), platelet-derived growth factor receptor b(bPDGF-R), and cell mor- phology when cultured on plastic plates (Xu et al., 2005; Olsen et al., 2011).
To promote a quiescent HSC phenotype, LX-2 cells were seeded at a density of3t o4×1 0 5cells per well to 12-well plates precoated with Growth Factor Re- duced Matrigel from Corning (Corning, NY) ( “Matrigel culture ”) as previously described (Sohara et al., 2002; Gac ¸a et al., 2003; Olsen et al., 2011). Although these cells may represent a mixture of quiescent and senescent stellate cells, they are referred to as quiescent cells here for clarity and exhibit a non ﬁbroblast-like morphology similar to quiescent cells (Gac ¸a et al., 2003; Olsen et al., 2011).Matrigel coating was performed according to manufacturer recommendations for the“Thin Gel Method ”(190mL Matrigel per well), gelled at 37/C14Cf o ra tl e a s t 30 minutes, and rinsed with warm DPBS prior to seeding cells (Sohara et al.,2002).The phenotype of the cultures was assessed based on the expression of aSMA mRNA and cell morphology as previously described (Olsen et al., 2011).
Although not directly measured, the phenotype of the quiescent cells was appar-ent based on a notable reduction in cell proliferation once plated on the Matrigel matrix as previously observed (Gac ¸a et al., 2003). The expression of the enzymes regulating retinoid homeostasis is typically regulated via presence of retinoids through various feedback loops.We hypothe- sized that maintenance of baseline vitamin A levels in the culture similar to reti- nol concentrations observed in vivo is necessary to maintain the network ofenzymes in HSC responsible for vitamin A metabolism.The culture of HepG2 cells in the presence of atRA was previously shown to be essential for constitu- tive CYP26A1 expression in vitro (Tay et al., 2010).To test the impact of retinolsupplementation, cells seeded on plastic (activated cells) were cultured in the presence or absence of 2 mM retinol for 48 hours prior to measuring the expres- sion of retinoid-metabolizing enzymes.
Subsequently, for all other experiments,cells were seeded, and culture media (1 mL) was refreshed daily (every 24 hours) during experiments to maintain 2- mM-retinol concentrations in the media in both activated and quiescent cell systems, mirroring the approximated concentration ofretinol in human circulation. To test whether the metabolic pathways of retinoids (retinol esteri ﬁcation and oxidation to atRA) are present in the quiescent and activated LX-2 cells, cells were seeded on Matrigel or plastic, as described above, in the presence of 2 mM retinol.The following morning, the media was changed, and cells were cultured in the presence of 2 mM retinol and 100 mM palmitic acid for 96 hours (1 mL media was replenished every 24 hours).Palmitic acid was added to the media to support the formation of retinyl palmitate during activity assays.This concentra- tion (100 mM) of palmitate was previously used in LX-2 cells to facilitate ester formation (Lee et al., 2010).
To con ﬁrm the impact of palmitate on retinyl ester formation, an experiment was also conducted without palmitate addition, supple- menting the cells only with retinol. The persistence of cell morphology in theFig.1.Vitamin A metabolic pathway and the enzymes involved in retinoid meta- bolic flux in human liver.The scheme shows the major enzymes and retinoid-binding proteins involved in modulating the metabolic steps.The ligand-free apoCRBP has been shown to inhibit retinol esterification and stimulate ester hydrolysis in add ition to having ALDH1A enzyme –specific effects on atRA formation.The CRABPs have been suggested to modulate RA oxidation by the apoCRABPs inhibiting CYP26 activityand the liganded holoCRABPs channeling their ligand to CYP26 for oxidation.TNF- aand IL-1 bRegulate Stellate Cell Retinoid Metabolism 443 presence of palmitate supplementation was con ﬁrmed through visual inspection.
The concentrations of retinol, retinyl palmitate, and retinoic acids were measured in the cells following a culture to steady state to assess the presence of vitamin A metabolic machinery. The metabolic activity of LX-2 cells toward retinoids wasthen measured using deuterium-labeled retinoids.Following the initial 24-hourculture with 2 mM retinol, culture media was replaced with 1 mL media supple- mented with 2 mM retinol-d 6and 100 mM palmitic acid, and the cells were incu- bated at 37/C14Cf o r8h o u r s ,2 4h o u r s ,o r4 8h o u r s .A te a c ht i m ep o i n t ,m e d i aw a s collected, light protected, and stored at /C080/C14C.Cells were brie ﬂyr i n s e dw i t h ice-cold DPBS followed by complete aspiration of residual liquid.Plates werew r a p p e di np a r a ﬁlm, light protected with foil, and stored at /C020 /C14C pending reti- noid extractions.Quantification of Cellular Retinoids.
To extract retinoic acids, retinol, and retinyl esters, cell monolayers from Matrigel coatings or from plastic werescraped in DPBS buffer, transferred to borosilicate tubes, and spiked with 20 mL of an internal standard mixture of 1 mM acitretin and 10 mM retinyl acetate. A two-round liquid-liquid extraction was performed as previously described (Czuba et al., 2020).Two milliliters of 25 mM potassium hydroxide in ethanol were added to each tube and extensively mixed on a vortex mixer, and retinol and ret-inyl esters were extracted using 10 ml of hexanes.Following centrifugation, thetop organic layer was transferred to a new glass tube, and 120 mlo f4 Nh y d r o - chloric acid was added to the bottom aqueous layer.The acidi ﬁed aqueous layer was vigorously vortexed, and retinoic acids were extracted with 10 mL of hex-anes.Hexane extracts were dried under N 2gas.Residues containing retinol and retinyl esters were reconstituted in 100 ml of ACN and aliquoted to two separate amber vials.
One vial was diluted threefold for the analysis of retinyl palmitate-d 6, and the other vial was diluted 30-fold for the analysis of retinol, retinol-d 6, and retinyl esters. The extracted residue containing retinoic acids (RA) was re-suspended in 100 ml of 60% ACN.Liquid chromatography tandem mass spec- trometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed using an AB Sciex 5500 QTRAP mass spectrometer coupled with an Agilent 1290 UHPLC (Agilent Technologies; Santa Clara, CA) according to validated published methods (Czuba et al., 2020,2021).Peaks were integrated with MultiQuant (AB Sciex).Cytokine Treatments.To determine the effect of cytokines on the gene ex- pression of hepatic vitamin A –metabolizing enzymes, LX-2 cells were cultured on either plastic or Matrigel in DMEM with 2 mM retinol and treated with10 ng/mL of TNF- a,I L - 1 b, IL-6, or vehicle control for 48 hours.As a positive control, LX-2 cells were treated with 100 ng/mL of LPS.The treatment media (1 mL) was refreshed after 24 hours.
To con ﬁrm that cytokine treatment alone did not alter the activation phenotype of LX-2 cells, aSMA ( ACTA )g e n ee x p r e s - sion was also quanti ﬁed. To determine the dose dependency of treatments on the mRNA expression of retinoid-metabolizing enzyme gene expression, LX-2 cellswere treated as above with 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 ng/mL of TNF- a, IL-1b, or IL-6.The cells were harvested at 48 hours for mRNA extraction and quanti ﬁcation.Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction.Total mRNA was extracted using TRI Reagent according to the manufacturer ’s recommendations.mRNA (0.5 –1mg) was converted to cDNA using a TaqMan Reverse Transcrip- tion kit with oligo (dT) 16reagent (Thermo Fisher, St.Louis, MO).Changes to the relative mRNA expression of genes were measured using a StepOnePlusreal-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrument (Applied Biosystems,Waltham, MA).
TaqMan gene expression master mix and TaqMan primer probesused were as follows: LRAT (Hs00428109), RDH10 (Hs00416907), RDH11 (Hs00211283), CYP1B1 (Hs00164383), ALDH1A1 (Hs00946916), ALDH1A2 (Hs00180254), CYP26A1 (Hs00175627), CYP26B1 (Hs01011223), STRA6 (Hs00980261), RARA (Hs00940446), RARB (Hs00977140), ACTA (cat. Hs00426835), RBP4 (Hs00924047), cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP )-1 (Hs00171635), CRABP2 (Hs00275636), and CRBP1 (Hs01011512).The expression of GusB (Hs00428126) was selected as the housekeeping gene based on a literature precedent describing its use as a stable housekeeping gene in LX-2 cell experiments involving cell activation stimuli (McVicker et al., 2020; Kataoka et al., 2021).For plates involving technical replicates of PCR measurements, the average cycle threshold (C T) of the replicates within a plate for each gene was used.Un- determined C Tvalues were set to 40, the maximum number of cycles run for real-time PCR.
The relative change in mRNA expression following cytokinetreatment in comparison with vehicle controls was measured using the 2 -DCT method and normalized to the 2-DCTfrom treated samples to the arithmetic mean of the 2-DCTmeasurements from the untreated samples. Individual data points are shown as the geometric mean of the fraction of expression remaining from techni- cal replicates from one experiment.Each experiment was repeated on 3 separatedays unless otherwise indicated.8 9 10 11 1201 × 1042 × 1043 × 104 Retention time (min)Peak intensityRetinol 16 18 20 2205 × 1041 × 1051.5 × 105 Retention time (min)Peak intensityRetinyl palmitate Other retinyl esters 8 9 10 11 1202 × 1034 × 1036 × 1038 × 1031 × 104 Retention time (min)Peak intensityatRA 13cisRA AB CDFig.2.Phenotype of LX-2 cells grown on a thin gel of Matrigel and retinoid metabolism in the quiescent LX-2 cells.

Undetermined C Tvalues were de ﬁned as 40, which is the maximum number of cycles run during PCR cycling. Experiments were performed on 3 separate days in triplicate measurements except where indi- cated.For experiments testing a single concentration of cytokine treatments, thedata from each experimental replicate were averaged to a single representative value, and the data bars are shown as the mean ± standard deviation of the aver- age expression.No statistical test was performed for treatments using supraphy-siological concentrations (single concentration) of cytokines.A signi ﬁcant effect of individual cytokine treatments on vitamin A –metabolizing enzyme gene ex- pression was inferred if there was a measurable exposure-response relationship, and EC 50values were calculated.Each experiment was repeated on 3 separatedays ( n53) and performed as technical triplicates at each dose.
Gene expres- sion was normalized to the measured average C Tvalues at 0 ng/mL treatment conditions, which was designated as 100% expression. For each experiment, the [inhibitor] versus response (three parameters) curve was ﬁt to the average gene expression level at the speci ﬁc concentrations to obtain an EC 50using GraphPad Prism.Data points are plotted as the mean ± standard deviation of the expression level (% response).For each experiment, the EC 50wasﬁt and constrained to a bottom >0% and top <120%.The EC 50values are reported as mean ± standard deviation of the experiments conducted on 3 separate days.Results LX-2 Cells Are a Model System for Vitamin A Metabolism in Hepatic Stellate Cells.

N.D., not detected.TNF- aand IL-1 bRegulate Stellate Cell Retinoid Metabolism 445 et al., 2017; Belyaeva et al., 2018; Shajari et al., 2019; Shmarakov et al., 2019; Czuba et al., 2021) (Fig. 1).However, isolated cells can represent amixed population of HSCs present in vivo with different states of activa-tion and quiescence.This is due to the fact that activated cells arise fromany paracrine or endocrine stimuli that lead to tissue injury.Activatingstimuli promote the resting, retinoid, and lipid-laden quiescent cells toproliferate and transdifferentiate.Stellate cell activation is a progressive pro-cess whereby gene expression and phenotypic changes occur along a con-tinuum until full differentiation into a ﬁbrogenic myo ﬁbroblast (Friedman, 2008).We hypothesized that LX-2 cells could be used as a model systemto study hepatic vitamin A homeostasis speci ﬁcally in activated and/or qui- escent cell states.
LX-2 cell phenotype and retinoid metabolic activity wereevaluated, and the mRNA expression of a panel of retinoid-metabolizingenzymes, binding proteins, and receptors was measured in LX-2 cells cul-tured under different conditions. Based on prior studies (Xu et al., 2005;Olsen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2019), modi ﬁcation of cell culture condi- tions, such as changing the serum percentage, retinol concentration, or in- corporation of a basement membrane matrix, allows for LX-2 cells toadopt either an “activated ”ﬁbroblast-like phenotype or a reverted, quiescent-like (hereby called quiescent) phenotype.Indeed, cells grownon Matrigel appeared quiescent and had a star- or dendrite-like morphol-ogy with long cellular processes (Olsen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2019)(Fig.2).Reproducing previous reports, growing LX-2 cells on plasticresulted in the activated phenotype (Fig.3).The cells had a ﬂattened, ﬁbroblast-like morphology and expressed the gene encoding a-SMA, ACTA .
To test whether LX-2 cells have the complete enzymatic machinery for vitamin A metabolic ﬂux that is found in human liver (Fig. 1), the formation of retinyl esters and atRA from retinol was tested.Hepatic stellate cells store the majority of the body ’s vitamin A as retinyl esters in vivo, and the esteri ﬁcation enzyme LRAT is considered a marker en- zyme for hepatic stellate cells.Hence, esteri ﬁcation of retinol is a key reaction to monitor to ensure functionality of stellate cells in culture.Retinyl esters were detected in LX-2 cells grown on Matrigel in the presence of retinol (2 mM) and excess palmitate (100 mM to support transesteri ﬁcation by LRAT) in the culture media (Fig.2).Retinyl palmi- tate was the main retinyl ester formed under these conditions (Fig.2), al-though other retinyl esters were also detected.Retinoic acid formationwas also measured in cultures supplemented with retinol.
The quiescentLX-2 cells cultured in the presence of retinol and palmitate producedatRA and 13- cis-retinoic acid (13 cisRA) (Fig. 2).This supports the hy- pothesis that quiescent stellate cells have the complete enzymatic machin-ery of vitamin A metabolic ﬂux.In the activated LX-2 cells, retinyl ester formation was also detected when the cells were cultured on plastic and media supplemented withretinol and palmitate (Fig.3).Surprisingly, no atRA nor the isomer 13cisRA were detected in activated LX-2 cells (cells grown on plastic) in the presence of supplemented retinol (Fig.3).This suggests that acti-vated stellate cells lose the ability to synthesize the bioactive retinoidatRA and its isomer 13 cisRA from retinol.To con ﬁrm these ﬁndings of the metabolic activity in the activated cells, the LX-2 cells were treatedwith retinol-d 6, and the formation of retinyl palmitate-d 6and RA-d 6iso- mers was measured.
Consistent with the ﬁndings with steady-state reti- noid concentrations, neither atRA-d 6nor 13 cisRA-d 6formation was detected. This is despite the fact that the overall cell number was higherin these experiments than in the experiments with the quiescent cells.Robust retinol esteri ﬁcation to retinyl palmitate-d 6was still observed in the activated cells (Fig.3).Taken together, the differences in retinoidmetabolite detection between the culture conditions suggest that thereare distinct differences in the expression and/or activity of the enzymesresponsible for retinol metabolism between the two culture conditions.To assess the expression of retinoid-metabolizing enzymes and retinoid-binding proteins in the quiescent and activated LX-2 cells, mRNA was extracted from quiescent and activated cells, and the mRNAexpression of genes encoding retinoid-metabolizing enzymes, receptors,and binding proteins was measured (Table 1).
When LX-2 cells were cul-t u r e do nM a t r i g e li nt h ep r e s e n c eo f2 mM retinol, the LX-2 cells ex- pressed a complement of retinoid-metabolizing enzymes (Fig. 1).The mRNA for enzymes for retinyl ester synthesis and hydrolysis, LRAT and PNPLA3, were detected together with the mRNAs of enzymes responsi- ble for RA synthesis, RDH10 ,RDH11 ,a n d ALDH1A2 , and for RA ca- tabolism, CYP26B1 .The mRNAs of the retinol uptake transporter STRA6 and the plasma retinol-binding protein RBP4 were not expressed in the quiescent cells (Table 1), suggesting that these cells do not take upRBP4-bound retinol nor secrete RBP4-retinol.The mRNAs for the en-zymes associated with atRA synthesis and clearance in human hepato- cytes, ALDH1A1 andCYP26A1 , were also not detected in the quiescent LX-2 cells cultured with retinol, differentiating these cells from hepato- cyte-like cell lines such as HepG2s.
The mRNAs for retinoic acid recep-torsRARaandRARbwere detected in the quiescent LX-2 cells similar to prior observations in HepG2 cells (Tay et al., 2010). Of the cellular retinoid-binding proteins, mRNAs for CRBP1 andCRABP2 were consis- tently detected, whereas CRABP1 was only occasionally detected with a high C Tvalue.The activated plastic-cultured cells expressed an extended comple- ment of mRNAs for the enzymes and proteins for vitamin A homeosta-sis when compared with the quiescent cells.In addition to the mRNAsdetected in the quiescent cells, activated cells cultured with equal con-centrations of retinol in the media expressed the mRNAs for the retinol uptake transporter STRA6 , the plasma retinol-binding protein RBP4 ,a n d theatRA hydroxylase CYP26A1 .T h em R N Af o r ALDH1A1 was not detected, and CRABP1 was only occasionally detected (Table 1).
Surpris- ingly, STRA6 mRNA expression was only detectable following culture of LX-2 cells in the presence of retinol, whereas other tested mRNAs were not sensitive to the presence of retinol and were detectable in the presenceand absence of retinol in the LX-2 cells grown on plastic (data not shown). The mRNA data suggested that quiescent LX-2 cells support the complete vitamin A metabolic ﬂux.To test this hypothesis, the kinetics of retinol metabolism were assessed in the quiescent LX-2 cells.TheTABLE 1 Retinoid-metabolizing enzyme, binding protein, and nuclear receptor expression patterns in different LX-2 cell culture conditions GeneQuiescent cells (1)2lM RetinolActivated Cells (1)2lM Retinol LRAT  PNPLA3  RDH10  RDH11  CYP1B1  ALDH1A1 –– ALDH1A2  CYP26A1 –  CYP26B1  STRA6a–  RBP4 –  CRBP1  CRABP1b–/ –/ CRABP2  RARA  RARB  aSTRA6 expression was not detected in the cells cultured on plastic but in the absence of retinol treatment.
bCRABP1 expression was consistently detected in the cells cultured on plastic but in the absence of retinol treatment.446 Czuba and Isoherranen cells were treated with stable-labeled retinol-d 6and palmitate, and the formation of the retinoid metabolome was measured. Within 8 hours, retinol-d 6accumulated in the cells, and the cell concentrations of retinol-d 6remained constant through the 48 hours of treatment (Fig.4).Formation of retinyl palmitate-d 6andatRA-d 6was observed within the ﬁrst 8 hours, and the concentrations of both metabolic products increased between 8 and 24 hours, reaching apparent steady state by 24 hours and remaining stable until 48 hours.The net formation of retinyl esters was about 100-fold higher than the net formation of RA, con ﬁrming thepredominant metabolic fate of retinol being the formation of retinyl esters rather than oxidation to RA in the quiescent cells.
These ﬁndings demon- strate that, as predicted from the mRNA expression data, quiescent LX-2cells have the complete complement of vitamin A metabolic machinery, and they can carry out the full vitamin A metabolic ﬂux, including retinol esteriﬁcation and formation of atRA and 13 cisRA.
The in vitro activity in the quiescent LX-2 cells recapitulates the predominant role of hepatic stellate cells in storing vitamin A as retinyl esters and human liver –like formation of RA.0 2 04 06 00100200300400 Time (hours)Retinol-d 6 (pmol/well) 91 0 1 1 1 201 × 1042 × 1043 × 104 Retention time (min)Peak intensityRetinol-d 6 02 0 4 0 6 00100200300400500 Time (hours)Retinyl palmitate-d 6 (pmol/well) 16 18 20 2201.25 × 1042.5 × 1043.75 × 1045 × 104 Retention time (min)Peak intensityRetinyl palmitate-d 6 Other retinyl esters-d 6 0 2 04 06 0051015 Time (hours)atRA-d 6 (pmol/well) 89 1 0 1 1 1 202 × 1034 × 1036 × 1038 × 1031 × 104 Retention time (min)Peak intensityatRA-d 6 13-cis-RA-d 6 02 0 4 0 6 00.00.51.01.52.0 Time (hours)13cisRA-d 6 (pmol/well)AB CD EF GFig. 4.Metabolism of vitamin A in quiescent LX-2 cells.

Modulation of retinoid-metabolizing enzyme gene expression by cytokines in quiescent LX-2 cell cultures (left) and activated LX-2 cultures (right ).LX-2 cells grown on a thin gel of Matrigel in the presence of 2 mM retinol were treated with (A) 100 ng/mL of LPS or 10 ng/mL of (B) TNF- a, (C) IL-1 b, or (D) IL-6.All data are normalized to the expression of housekeeping gene GusB and presented as the percentage of expression remaining relative to vehicle-treated control measurements.Experiments were per- formed on 3 separate days (quiescent) or 2 separate days (activated), with each experiment having triplicate measurements.The data from each experi mental replicate was aver- aged to a single representative value.Data bars are shown as the mean and S.D.

Stimulating cultured rat stellate cells with LPS induces the expression of genes involved in cytokine synthesis and signaling and increases the secretion of TNF- a, IL-1b, and IL-6 (Harvey et al., 2013).To test the impact of LPS on the mRNA expression of retinoid-metabolizing enzymes in stellate cells, quiescent and activated LX-2 cells were cultured with a supraphy- siological concentration of LPS (100 ng/mL) in the media.LPS treat- ment decreased LRAT mRNA expression in both quiescent and activated LX-2 cells (Fig.5).This demonstrates the cellular response toexogenous treatments, which stimulate cytokine signaling cascades in both quiescent and activated cultures.
LPS also reduced CRBP1 and CRABP2 mRNA expression to /C2450% of the control expression in both culture types. In the activated cells, the single-concentration LPS treatment also showed a trend toward a decrease of CYP1B1 , ALDH1A2 ,CYP26A1 ,a n d RARB mRNA, suggesting that cytokine sig- naling pathways also affect these mRNAs.Surprisingly, LPS treatment appeared to increase the mRNA expression of STRA6, RBP4 ,a n d RARA in the activated cells.We hypothesized that the LPS-stimulated changes in the transcription of vitamin A –metabolizing enzymes were due to the activation of ca- nonical cytokine signaling pathways.To test this hypothesis, quiescentand activated LX-2 cells were treated with 10 ng/mL TNF- a,I L - 1 b,o r IL-6.The concentration of 10 ng/mL was chosen to mimic liver concen- trations following acute or local liver injury and/or in ﬂammation.
Sys- temic concentrations of cytokines are generally lower than 10 ng/mL in humans, but speci ﬁc cytokines within the liver, such as TNF- a,I L - 1 b, and IL-6, are part of the acute phase response after injury, and therefore, local concentrations are likely to be higher in the liver than in systemic circulation. LPS treatment of quiescent rat stellate cells in vitro alters the expression of numerous cytokines, chemokines, and receptors, in- cluding those essential to both the sensitivity and secretion of TNF- a, IL-1b, and IL-6 (Harvey et al., 2013).Notably, prior work has shown that 24-hour treatment with LPS promotes the secretion of TNF- ainto culture media (Harvey et al., 2013), although the 10 ng/mL concentra- tion used here likely exceeds the expression levels of these cytokines following the LPS treatment in vitro.
To con ﬁrm that the 10 ng/mL con- centration of cytokines does not alter the activation status of the LX-2 cells, a-SMA ( ACTA) mRNA expression was measured in both systems. It was not affected by treatment with LPS (100 ng/mL) or supraphysiologi- cal concentrations (10 ng/mL) of speci ﬁc cytokines (TNF- a,I L - 1 b,I L - 6 ) (Fig.6).Similar to what was observed with LPS treatment and consistent with the hypothesis that LPS treatment induces cytokine secretion and gene expression via cytokine signaling, TNF- aand IL-1 bdecreased LRAT , CRBP1 ,a n d CRABP2 mRNA expression by more than 50% in quies- cent and activated cells, reproducing the effects observed with LPS (Fig.5).In contrast, IL-6 (10 ng/mL) did not alter the expression of any of the retinoid-related genes in quiescent LX-2 cells (Fig.5).IL-6 did, however, decrease the expression of LRAT ,CRBP1 ,a n d CRABP2 mRNA in the activated cells (Fig.
5), demonstrating differences in thesensitivity of the quiescent and activated cells to cytokine signaling. Similar to the changes observed with LPS treatment, in the activated cells all three cytokines caused a decrease in mRNA expression of RARB and CYP26A1 , suggesting that the cytokines in ﬂuence the mRNA of the classic retinoid responsive (RA-regulated) genes.In addition to the observations of the mRNAs altered following LPS treatment, TNF- aalso reduced the mRNA expression of PNPLA3 and CYP1B1 by more than 50% in the quiescent cells (Fig.5).Of the tested cytokines, TNF- awas the only one that affected the mRNA expression ofPNPLA3 in either culture condition and the mRNA expression ofCYP1B1 in the quiescent cells.Both IL-1 band IL-6 decreased CYP1B1 mRNA expression in the activated LX-2 cells, similar to LPS, but not in the quiescent cells.In the activated cells, TNF- aand IL-1 balso ap- peared to decrease the mRNA expression of ALDH1A2 .
Surprisingly, the mRNA expression of RDH10 ,RDH11 ,a n d CRABP1 was increased in cells treated with TNF- acompared with untreated cells. The mRNAs ofRARaandSTRA6 were increased in the activated LX-2 cells treated with IL-6.RBP4 mRNA was increased in the activated LX-2 cells treated with IL-1 b.Taken together, different patterns of mRNA changes were observed with individual cytokine treatments, but the individual cytokine effects together capture the full complement of mRNA changes observed following LPS treatment.These ﬁndings indicate dif- ferent regulatory pathways for the different genes involved in modulat- ing retinoid homeostasis.To further de ﬁne the impact and biologic signi ﬁcance of TNF- aand IL-1bon vitamin A metabolism in quiescent stellate cells, dose- response studies were conducted for genes that were impacted by 10-ng/mL cytokine treatment using the quiescent model, which is the most rele- vant for constitutive regulation of vitamin A homeostasis in the liver.
IL-6 was not investigated due to the limited effects of this cytokine in the quiescent cultures at 10 ng/mL (Fig. 5).TNF- aexhibited a dose- dependent downregulation of LRAT (Fig.7A), CRBP1 (Fig.7B), and CYP1B1 (Fig.7C) mRNA expression in quiescent LX-2 cells (Table 2), with the largest maximum decrease in gene expression observed for LRAT andCRBP1 .Prior work using primary rat HSC cultures has demonstrated the capacity of LPS-stimulated cells to secrete /C24300 pg/mL of TNF- a (Harvey et al., 2013), a concentration 6 –10 times higher than the EC 50val- ues indicated here.Likewise, the estimated EC 50values (Table 2) are lower than the serum TNF- aconcentrations measured in patients with chronic hepatitis C with advancing liver ﬁbrosis (Hammam et al., 2013).Despite the decrease in PNPLA3 mRNA observed in initial experiments done at a single concentration of TNF- a, no full dose response was observed in the follow-up experiments.
This suggests that the TNF- aEC50value for PNPLA3 downregulation is >10 ng/mL or that PNPLA3 mRNA half-life is longer than 48 hours, preventing observations of complete downregulation in these experiments. The impact of mRNA and protein half-life on the magnitude of observed downregulation has been previously illustrated with the observed magnitude at a given time point depending on the maxi- mum downregulation at steady state and the half-life of the mRNA andLPS TNFα IL-1β IL-60.00.51.01.5QuiescentFraction ofACTA expression remainingAB LPS TNFα IL-1β IL-60.00.51.01.5Fraction ofACTA expression remainingActivated Fig.6.asmooth muscle actin (ACTA) gene expression was not induced follow- ing exogenous treatment with the known stellate cell activators LPS (100 ng/mL)or cytokines (10 ng/mL).Data are normalized to the housekeeping gene GusB and presented as the percentage of expression remaining relative to vehicle- treated control measurements.

Discussion The HSCs are critical for the maintenance of vitamin A homeostasis by storing the majority of the body ’s vitamin A in the form of retinylesters, predominantly as retinyl palmitate (Blaner, 2019).LX-2 cells have been previously shown to recapitulate retinol esteri ﬁcation activity (Xu et al., 2005).Prior studies have, however, been unclear on how cul-ture conditions and activation status of LX-2 cells affect retinol esteri ﬁ- cation and whether RA synthesis is present in LX-2 cells.This study shows that the quiescent LX-2 model recapitulates the overall vitamin A homeostasis observed in the human liver and that LX-2 cells (orHSCs) synthesize atRA and 13 cisRA.
In the quiescent cells, retinol me- tabolism is dominated by the esteri ﬁcation pathway mimicking the human liver, where retinyl palmitate concentrations were orders of magnitude higher than atRA and 13 cisRA (Zhong et al., 2019a). This study establishes that LX-2 cells provide a model to differentiate the vitamin A metabolism and enzyme expression between quiescentand activated HSC populations.Quiescent LX-2 cells have different0.00010.001 0.010.1 110 100050100150 TNF-α [ng/mL]LRATexpression (% Response) 0.00010.001 0.010.1 110 100050100150 TNF-α [ng/mL]CRBP1 expression (% Response) 0.00010.001 0.010.1 110 100050100150 TNF-α [ng/mL]CYP1B1 expression (% Response) 0.00010.001 0.010.1 110 100050100150200 TNF-α [ng/mL]PNPLA3 expression (% Response) 0.00010.001 0.010.1 110 100050100150200 TNF-α [ng/mL]CYP26B1 expression (% Response) 0.00010.001 0.010.1 110 100050100150 TNF-α [ng/mL]ALDH1A2 expression (% Response)AB CD EFFig.7.
TNF- adose-dependently downregulates retinoid-metabolizing enzymes in quiescent LX-2 cells. LX-2 cells were treated with TNF- a(0, 0.001, 0.01, 1, or 10 ng/mL) for 48 hours, and the mRNA expression of (A) LRAT ,( B ) CRBP1 ,( C ) CYP1B1 ,( D ) PNPLA3 ,( E ) CYP26B1 , and (F) ALDH1A2 was measured.Each experiment was performed as triplicate measurements at each dose and repeated on 3 separate days ( n53).Gene expression was normalized to the measured expression at 0 ng/mL treat-ment, which was designated as 100% expression.The [inhibi- tor] versus response (three parameters) curve was fit to individual average gene expression level at the specific concen- trations for each of the triplicate experiments to obtain the EC 50 of TNF- ain GraphPad Prism.Data points are plotted as the geometric mean of the expression level (% response), and error bars are the geometric S.D.calculated by GraphPad Prism.
For each experiment, the EC 50was fit and constrained to a bottom >0% and top <120%.450 Czuba and Isoherranen vitamin A metabolism and likely different enzyme expression than acti- vated LX-2 cells. Robust expression of STRA6 ,RBP4 ,a n d CYP26A1 mRNAs was observed in the activated LX-2 cells but not in the quies-cent LX-2 cells.Although further studies of protein expression and met-abolic ﬂux are needed, this suggests that upon activation, HSCs enter a vitamin A hypermetabolic state that acts in concert to decrease cellular atRA concentrations and deplete retinyl ester stores.The expression of RBP4 likely allows mobilization of the vitamin A stores, facilitating de-pletion of retinyl esters and secretion of retinol bound to RBP4 directlyfrom the stellate cell stores.RBP4 also sequesters retinol and limits its availability for oxidation, potentially reducing atRA formation.
Ex- pression of CYP26A1, on the other hand, may result in increased atRA clearance, reducing atRA concentrations. The lack of atRA or very low concentrations of atRA in activated cells may have important roles in regulating gene expression as the effects of atRA on cell differentiation and apoptosis are concentration dependent.The interpretation of the hypermetabolic state in activated LX-2 cells agrees with observations in human liver slices in culture (Czuba et al.,2021).In the liver slices, the overall changes in retinoid metabolomeduring culture and ﬁbrogenesis could only be explained by a model that incorporated decreased LRAT expression, increased retinol elimination, and increased CYP26 expression (Czuba et al., 2021).The data pre-sented here suggest that these changes in metabolic processes are local-ized to the stellate cells.
STRA6 ,RBP4 ,a n d CYP26A1 mRNAs were previously detected in HSCs isolated from human donor livers, although with high variability (Czuba et al., 2021). It is likely that the HSCs iso- lated from human livers represent a mixed population of activated, qui-escent, and/or senescent HSCs in which activated cells express STRA6 , RBP4 ,a n d CYP26A1 , whereas quiescent ones do not.The upregulation ofSTRA6 mRNA in activated LX-2 cells observed here and previously (Czuba et al., 2021) may be a compensatory mechanism to maintain ret- inol homeostasis subsequent to retinyl ester mobilization.Collectively,these data support the hypothesis that stellate cell activation and meta-bolic processes in the HSCs dictate altered vitamin A homeostasis inliverﬁbrosis.The mRNA expression of ALDH1A andCYP26 enzymes in LX-2 cells sheds light on cell type –speciﬁc hepatic vitamin A metabolism and autocrine retinoid signaling.
These data indicate that whole-tissue en-zyme expression should be interpreted with caution in tissues that con-sist of diverse cell types with distinct roles in retinoid homeostasis. ALDH1A1 mRNA was not detected here in the LX-2 cells, but ALDH1A1 has been shown to be the main enzyme synthesizing atRA in the human liver (Zhong et al., 2021).ALDH1A1 mRNA is high inthe hepatocytes and detectable in HSCs (Czuba et al., 2021), suggesting that liver atRA synthesis mainly occurs in hepatocytes.ALDH1A2 was not detectable in whole liver (Zhong et al., 2021) nor was its mRNA de-tectable in isolated hepatocytes (Czuba et al., 2021).In contrast, ALDH1A2 mRNA was detectable in isolated HSCs (Czuba et al., 2021) and in both quiescent and activated LX-2 cells.The cell type – speciﬁc role of ALDH1A2 in HSC is similar to the distinct cell type – speciﬁc role of ALDH1A enzymes in human testis (Arnold et al., 2015) and supports a role of ALDH1A2 in autocrine atRA signaling in the HSCs.
CYP26A1 mRNA was only present in the activated LX-2 cells, whereas CYP26B1 mRNA was present in both activated and quiescent cells. CYP26A1 is the main human liver retinoic acid hydroxylase (Tay et al., 2010; Thatcher et al., 2010), whereas CYP26B1 has been consid- ered an extrahepatic CYP26 (Topletz et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2019a).In the human liver, CYP26A1 mRNA and protein expression was highly variable, whereas CYP26B1 protein was not detected, and CYP26B1 mRNA was detected in 54% of livers analyzed (Tay et al., 2010; Thatcher et al., 2010).Based on these data, it is possible that CYP26B1 expression in the human liver is localized speci ﬁcally to the stellate cells.As these cells are a minor fraction of the overall cellularity of the liver, CYP26B1 is not easily detectable in whole-liver preparations.Fu- ture studies in isolated human HSCs are needed to test this hypothesis.
CYP26A1 mRNA expression in the activated LX-2 cells corresponds to the detected, highly variable mRNA expression of CYP26A1 in stellate cells isolated from human liver tissue (Czuba et al., 2021). This supports a mixed population of quiescent and activated HSCs isolated from hu-man liver.Together, these ﬁndings also support a role of CYP26A1 as the inducible liver CYP26 enzyme responding to environmental stimuli (Zhong et al., 2019a).Previous studies in human liver slices suggested that changes to vita- min A metabolism in the liver occur prior to upregulation of HSC acti- vation markers, collagen deposition, and ﬁbrogenesis (Czuba et al., 2021).Likewise, prior work supports that paracrine signaling “initiates ” HSC activation events (Friedman, 2008).The liver slice culture involves robust upregulation and secretion of TNF -a, IL-1, and IL-6 expression (Olinga et al., 2001; Schaffert et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2018).
Secretion of cytokines such as IL-1 band TNF- aby Kupffer cells downregulates LRAT gene expression upstream of retinoid depletion (Kida et al.,2011). Hence, cytokine signaling is likely an important factor in modulat- ing vitamin A metabolism upon liver injury.The archetypical activator LPS initiates a cascade of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent and -independent signaling cascades that acutely induce cytokine expression and secretion in quiescent HSCs and are sustained through activation (Harvey et al., 2013).In vivo in rats, LPS treatment also alters circulating retinoids (Cifelli and Ross, 2006) and opposes CYP26 (Zolfaghari et al.,2007).The pattern of changes in retinoid-metabolizing genes with LPS treatment observed here was captured by treatment with the individual cytokines in the two culture systems.This supports the model (Fig.9) that changes in vitamin A metabolism during stellate cell activation are initiated by paracrine cytokine signaling prior to HSC activation.
HSC ac-tivation is, however, likely an obligate step to fully capture the collective downstream effects of cytokine signaling on vitamin A metabolism. Based on the ﬁndings of gene regulation by TNF- aand IL-1 b, changes inLRAT ,CRBP1 ,a n d CRABP2 mRNA following treatment of quiescent cells with LPS, and the subsequent changes on plastic to CYP26A1 , RARB ,a n d CYP1B1 m R N A ,a r el i k e l yd r i v e nb ya u t o c r i n es i g n a l i n gb y the secreted cytokines induced by LPS.IL-6 did not have any effects on the quiescent cells, suggesting that the effects of IL-6 on vitamin A metabolism are downstream of early signaling events.IL-6 –dependent activation of HSCs requires activationTABLE 2 EC50values of TNF- aand IL-1 bdose-dependent effect on retinoid-metabolizing enzyme gene expression Individual EC 50values were approximated by fitting dose curves to [inhibitor] versus response (three parameters) fit and constrained to >0% and <120% using GraphPad Prism.
The data shown are the geometric mean and range of three EC50values derived from independent dose curves measured as technical tripli- cates at each concentration.

Individual treat- ments with these two cytokines promoted compounding changes inretinoid-metabolizing genes in the quiescent model, likely attributed to both paracrine and autocrine effects. Future work is needed to determine the secretion of cytokines and chemokines in this system when IL-1 b and TNF- aare given alone, and in combination, to determine if the in- creased sensitivity of gene expression changes in activated cells is due to increased media concentrations of cytokines and/or crosstalkingdownstream signaling pathways.In conclusion, the current study demonstrates LX-2 cells as a model of vitamin A metabolism in different phenotypes of HSCs.The activity andexpression data support the use of LX-2 cells to investigate the regu- lation of vitamin A homeostasis and consequent changes in signalingin HSCs.
In the two cell models presented, differences in the mRNA expression of STRA6 ,RBP4 , and CYP26A1 may underlie the func- tional differences in vitamin A metabolic capacity of activated ver-sus quiescent HSCs. The current data demonstrate that cytokinesalter the expression of many genes important for vitamin A metabo- lism and storage.This is signi ﬁcant for many disease conditions as- sociated with increased cytokine levels in various tissues beyond theliver.
Although the current data may implicate a role of paracrineand autocrine signaling by cytokines, future work is needed to eluci- date the discrete mechanisms by which cytokines contribute to al- tered gene expression during HSC activation.0.00010.001 0.010.1 110 100050100150 IL-1β [ng/mL]LRATexpression (%Response) 0.0001 0.001 0.010.1 110 100050100150 IL-1β [ng/mL]RBP1 expression (%Response) 0.00010.001 0.010.1 110 100050100150 IL-1β [ng/mL]CYP1B1expression (%Response) 0.00010.001 0.010.1 110 100050100150 IL-1β [ng/mL]CYP26B1expression (%Response) 0.00010.001 0.010.1 110 100050100150200 IL-1β [ng/mL]RDH10expression (%Response) 0.00010.001 0.010.1 110 100050100150 IL-1β [ng/mL]RARBexpression (%Response)AB CD EFFig. 8.LRAT and CRBP1 are dose-dependently downregulated by IL-1 bin LX-2 cells.
LX-2 cells were treated with IL-1 b(0, 0.001, 0.01, 1, or 10 ng/mL) for 48 hours, and the mRNA ex- pression of (A) LRAT ,( B ) CRBP1 ,( C ) CYP1B1 ,( D ) CYP26B1, (E)RDH10 , and (F) RARB was measured. Each experiment was performed as triplicate measurements at each dose and repeatedon 3 separate days ( n53).Gene expression was normalized to the measured expression at 0 ng/mL treatment, which was desig- nated as 100% expression.The [inhibitor] versus response (threeparameters) curve was fit to individual average gene expression level at the specific concentrations for each of the triplicate ex- periments to obtain the EC 50of IL-1 bin GraphPad Prism.Data points are plotted as the geometric mean of the expression level (% response), and error bars are the geometric S.D.determined byGraphPad Prism.
The fitted EC 50is constrained to a bottom >0% and top <120%.452 Czuba and Isoherranen Data Availability The authors declare that all the data supporting the findings of this study are contained within the paper.
