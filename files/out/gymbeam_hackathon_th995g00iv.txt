Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.A B S T R A C T Background Magnesium is an essential mineral required for regulation of body temperature, nucleic acid and protein synthesis and in maintaining nerve and muscle cell electrical potentials.Many women, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have low intakes of magnesium.Magnesium supplementation during pregnancy may be able to reduce fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia, and increase birthweight.Objectives To assess the eﬀects of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal/infant and paediatric outcomes.Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013).Selection criteria Randomised and quasi-randomised trials assessing the eﬀects of dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy were included.
The primary outcomes were perinatal mortality (including stillbirth and neonatal death prior to hospital discharge), small-for-gestational age, maternal mortality and pre-eclampsia. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.Main results Ten trials involving 9090 women and their babies were included; one trial had a cluster design (with randomisation by study centre).All 10 trials randomly allocated women to either an oral magnesium supplement or a control group; in eight trials a placebo was used, and in two trials no treatment was given to the control group.In the 10 included trials, the compositions of the magnesium supplements, gestational ages at commencement, and doses administered varied, including: magnesium oxide, 1000 mg daily from ≤ four months post-conception Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy (Review) Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.
Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.1 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (one trial); magnesium citrate, 365 mg daily from ≤ 18 weeks until hospitalisation a/f_ter 38 weeks (one trial), and 340 mg daily from nine to 27 weeks' gestation (one trial); magnesium gluconate, 2 to 3 g from 28 weeks' gestation until birth (one trial), and 4 g daily from 23 weeks' gestation (one trial); magnesium aspartate, 15 mmol daily (three trials, commencing from either six to 21 weeks' gestation until birth, ≤ 16 weeks' gestation until birth, or < 12 weeks until birth), or 365 mg daily from 13 to 24 weeks until birth (one trial); and magnesium stearate, 128 mg elemental magnesium from 10 to 35 weeks until birth (one trial).
In the analysis of all trials, oral magnesium supplementation compared to no magnesium was associated with no significant diﬀerence in perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal death prior to discharge) (risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.67; five trials, 5903 infants), small-for-gestational age (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07; three trials, 1291 infants), or pre-eclampsia (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.32; three trials, 1042 women). None of the included trials reported on maternal mortality.Considering secondary outcomes, while no increased risk of stillbirth was observed, a possible increased risk of neonatal death prior to hospital discharge was shown for infants born to mothers who had received magnesium (RR 2.21; 95% CI 1.02 to 4.75; four trials, 5373 infants).
One trial contributed over 70% of the participants to the analysis for this outcome; the trial authors suggested that the large number of severe congenital anomalies in the supplemented group (unlikely attributable to magnesium) and the deaths of two sets of twins (with birthweights < 750 g) in the supplemented group likely accounted for the increased risk of death observed, and thus this result should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, when the deaths due to severe congenital abnormalities in this trial were excluded from the meta-analysis, no increased risk of neonatal death was seen for the magnesium supplemented group.
Magnesium supplementation was associated with significantly fewer babies with an Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.80; four trials, 1083 infants), with meconium-stained liquor (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99; one trial, 4082 infants), late fetal heart decelerations (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.88; one trial, 4082 infants), and mild hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98; one trial, 4082 infants). Women receiving magnesium were significantly less likely to require hospitalisation during pregnancy (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86; three trials, 1158 women).Of the 10 trials included in the review, only two were judged to be of high quality overall.When an analysis was restricted to these two trials none of the review's primary outcomes (perinatal mortality, small-for-gestational age, pre-eclampsia) were significantly diﬀerent between the magnesium supplemented and control groups.
Authors' conclusions There is not enough high-quality evidence to show that dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial. P L A I N /uni00A0 L A N G U A G E /uni00A0 S U M M A R Y There is not enough high quality evidence to show that dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial Many women, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have intakes of magnesium below recommended levels.Magnesium supplementation during pregnancy may be able to reduce growth restriction of the fetus and pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine during pregnancy), and increase birthweight.This review aimed to assess the eﬀects of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal and paediatric outcomes.We included 10 randomised trials involving 9090 women and their babies in this review.These trials were of a low to moderate quality overall.
No diﬀerence in the risk of perinatal mortality (stillbirth and death of babies prior to hospital discharge) was found when we compared the group of babies born to mothers who received magnesium during their pregnancy and the group of babies born to mothers who did not receive magnesium. Magnesium supplementation did not reduce the risk of babies being born small for their gestational age, and did not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia for the mothers.We found no convincing evidence that magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial.Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy (Review) Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.2 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews B A C K G R O U N D Magnesium is one of the essential minerals needed by humans in relatively large amounts.
Magnesium works with many enzymes to regulate body temperature, synthesise nucleic acids and proteins as well as maintaining electrical potentials in nerves and muscle membranes. Magnesium also has an important role in modulating vasomotor tone and cardiac excitability.Magnesium occurs widely in many foods; dairy products, breads and cereals, legumes, vegetables and meats are all good sources.It is therefore not surprising that frank magnesium deficiency has never been reported to occur in healthy individuals who eat varied diets.However, processing of the above foods can lead to marked depletion of magnesium.Common causes of magnesium deficiency include inadequate dietary intake or gastrointestinal absorption, increased losses through the gastrointestinal or renal systems and increased requirement for magnesium, such as in pregnancy.
A study measuring serum magnesium during low-risk pregnancies reported that both ionised and total serum magnesium were significantly reduced a/f_ter the 18th week of gestation compared to measurements prior to this time (Arikan 1999). Dietary intake studies during pregnancy consistently demonstrate that many women, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have intakes of magnesium below recommended levels (Inst Med 1990).In a retrospective study of medical records, Conradt 1984 reported that magnesium supplementation during pregnancy was associated with a reduced risk of fetal growth retardation and pre- eclampsia.A later cross-sectional study of dietary intake towards the end of the first trimester of pregnancy reported that higher magnesium intake was associated with increased birthweight (Doyle 1989).
Stimulated by these encouraging preliminary reports, several randomised clinical trials have been undertaken to evaluate the potential benefits of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and infant outcomes. Why it is important to do this review This review updates a previously published Cochrane review on magnesium supplementation during pregnancy (Makrides 2001 ).In this previous version of the review, magnesium supplementation was shown to be associated with a lower frequency of preterm birth, low birthweight and small-for-gestational age when compared with placebo.However, of the seven trials included in this previous version, only one was judged to be of high quality.Thus the review authors concluded that there was not enough high- quality evidence to show that dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial.It is important to assess whether magnesium supplementation during pregnancy has benefits for mothers and their infants without causing harm.
We believe this review could provide information about the potential for magnesium supplementation to improve neonatal/infant outcomes such as weight and growth and improve maternal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, without causing adverse eﬀects for women and their babies. O B J E C T I V E S To assess the eﬀects of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal/infant and paediatric outcomes, using the best available evidence.M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised, quasi- randomised trials or cluster-randomised trials of dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy.For the purpose of this review, a dietary supplement was defined as a product taken by mouth that contains a "dietary ingredient" intended to supplement the diet (US FDA 2009).Types of participants Women with normal or high-risk pregnancies.

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and contains trials identified from: 1.monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); 2.weekly searches of MEDLINE; 3.weekly searches of Embase; 4.handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences; 5.weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts. Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the ‘Specialized Register’ section within the editorial information about the/uni00A0Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.Trials identified through the searching activities described above are each assigned to a review topic (or topics).
The Trials Search Co- ordinator searches the register for each review using the topic list rather than keywords. We did not apply any language restrictions.Data collection and analysis For the methods used when assessing the trials identified in a previous version of this review (Other published versions of this review), see Appendix 1 .For the most recent update we used the following methods when assessing the trials identified by the search.Selection of studies Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy.We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we consulted a third person.Data extraction and management We designed a form to extract data.For eligible studies, at least two review authors extracted the data using the agreed form.We resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we consulted a third person.
We entered data into Review Manager so/f_tware (RevMan 2012) and checked for accuracy. When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.When articles were not written in English, every attempt was made to obtain translations to ensure accurate data extraction and analysis.Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ).We resolved any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third author.(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias) We described for each included study the methods used to generate the allocation sequence in suﬀicient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.We assessed the methods as: •low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g.
random number table; computer random number generator); •high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); •unclear risk of bias.(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias) We described for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determined whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed a/f_ter assignment.We assessed the methods as: •low risk of bias (e.g.telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); •high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non- opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); •unclear risk of bias.
(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias) We described for each included study, the methods, if any, used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered studies to be at a low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy (Review) Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.4 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews of blinding would be unlikely to aﬀect results.We assessed blinding separately for diﬀerent outcomes or classes of outcomes.We assessed the methods as: •low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants; •low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.
(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias) We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for diﬀerent outcomes or classes of outcomes.We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as: •low, high or unclear risk of bias.(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data) We described for each included study and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis.
We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes./uni00A0Where suﬀicient information was reported or was supplied by the trial authors, we included the missing data in the analyses which we undertook. /uni00A0We assessed the methods as: •low risk of bias (e.g.where there was no missing data or where reasons for missing data were balanced across groups); •high risk of bias (e.g.numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; 'as treated' analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation); •unclear risk of bias.
(5) Selective reporting bias (checking for reporting bias) We described for each included study how the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias was examined by us and what we found. We assessed the methods as: •low risk of bias (where it was clear that all of the study’s pre- specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review had been reported); •high risk of bias (where not all the study’s pre-specified outcomes had been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); •unclear risk of bias.(6) Other sources of bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above) We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.
We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias: •low risk of other bias; •high risk of other bias; •unclear whether there is risk of other bias. (7) Overall risk of bias We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ).With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings./uni00A0We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - see Sensitivity analysis .Measures of treatment eﬀect Dichotomous data For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals Continuous data For continuous data, we used the mean diﬀerence when outcomes were measured in the same way between trials.
We planned to use the standardised mean diﬀerence to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used diﬀerent methods. Unit of analysis issues Cluster-randomised trials We have included one cluster-randomised trial (Hungary 1988) in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials.We have adjusted its sample size and event rates using the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook and a conservative estimate of the intracluster correlation co-eﬀicient (ICC) (0.02) in the primary analysis (Higgins 2011 ) (Table 1).As estimates of ICCs for mortality outcomes have been shown to be lower than for other perinatal outcomes, we also carried out a sensitivity analysis to investigate the eﬀect of varying the ICC (using a range of ICCs from 0.0002 to 0.02) for the outcomes perinatal mortality, stillbirth, and neonatal death prior to discharge.
We acknowledged heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and performed a subgroup analysis to investigate the eﬀects of the randomisation unit. Dealing with missing data For included studies, we noted levels of attrition.We planned to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment eﬀect by using sensitivity analyses.For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e.we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy (Review) Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.5 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention.
The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing. Assessment of heterogeneity We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau/two.sups, I/two.sups and Chi/two.sups statistics.We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I/two.sups was greater than 30% and either the Tau/two.sups was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi/two.sups test for heterogeneity.Assessment of reporting biases In future updates of this review, if there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we plan to investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots.We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually.If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.Data synthesis We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager so/f_tware (RevMan 2012).
We used fixed-eﬀect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment eﬀect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials’ populations and methods were judged suﬀiciently similar.If there was clinical heterogeneity suﬀicient to expect that the underlying treatment eﬀects diﬀered between trials, or where substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-eﬀects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment eﬀect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.The random-eﬀects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment eﬀects and we have discussed the clinical implications of treatment eﬀects diﬀering between trials.If the average treatment eﬀect was not clinically meaningful, we would not have combined trials.
Where we have used random-eﬀects analyses, we have presented the results as the average treatment eﬀect with its 95% confidence interval, and the estimates of/uni00A0 Tau/two.sups and I/two.sups. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity If we had identified substantial heterogeneity, we planned to investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.We planned to consider whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, used random-eﬀects analysis to produce it.Maternal characteristics and characteristics of the intervention may aﬀect health outcomes.We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses.•Composition of magnesium supplement (i.e.magnesium citrate versus magnesium aspartate versus other) •Dose of magnesium (i.e.high versus low) •Gestational age at commencement of supplementation (i.e.
commencement at < 28 weeks versus ≥ 28 weeks) •Normal versus high-risk women However, we were not able to conduct subgroup analyses based on the gestational age at commencement of supplementation or onthe inclusion of normal versus high-risk women, as only one trial administered magnesium a/f_ter 28 weeks' gestation and included high-risk women (China 1997 ), and this trial did not report on any of the review's primary outcomes. We were not able to conduct a subgroup analysis based on dose in this update.We restricted subgroup analyses to primary outcomes.We assessed subgroup diﬀerences by interaction tests available within RevMan (RevMan 2012).We have reported the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi/two.sups statistic and P value, and the interaction test I/two.sups value.
Sensitivity analysis We carried out a sensitivity analysis to explore the eﬀects of trial quality assessed by allocation concealment and sequence generation, by omitting studies rated as 'high risk of bias' and 'unclear' for these components. We restricted this to the primary outcomes.R E S U L T S Description of studies See Characteristics of included studies; Characteristics of excluded studies and Characteristics of ongoing studies.Results of the search The updated search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register identified 22 new reports relating to 14 studies.We have included three new trials (Hungary 1979; Italy 1994; South Africa 2007), and have excluded nine studies (Denmark 1990; Denmark 1991 ; Detroit 1999; India 2012 ; ISRCTN03989660; NCT01709968; Norway 2008; Sweden 1987; Sweden 1995).
Two trials are currently ongoing, assessing magnesium supplementation in the second trimester of pregnancy for overweight individuals (NCT01510665) and magnesium citrate for the prevention of increased blood pressure during the final weeks of pregnancy (ISRCTN98365455) (see Characteristics of ongoing studies for further details). We previously included seven trials in this review (Angola 1992; Austria 1997; China 1997 ; Hungary 1988; Memphis 1989 ; Mississippi 1992; Zurich 1988).We have therefore included a total of 10 trials (Angola 1992; Austria 1997; China 1997 ; Hungary 1979; Hungary 1988; Italy 1994; Memphis 1989 ; Mississippi 1992 ; South Africa 2007; Zurich 1988), and excluded a total of nine studies from this review.Included studies For full details see Characteristics of included studies.
Five studies were conducted in Europe (Austria 1997; Hungary 1979; Hungary 1988; Italy 1994; Zurich 1988), two in America (Memphis 1989; Mississippi 1992 ), two in Africa (Angola 1992; South Africa 2007), and one in Asia (China 1997 ). Participants A total of 9090 women and their babies were included in the 10 trials; four trials had sample sizes of less than 150 women (Angola Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy (Review) Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.6 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 1992; China 1997 ; Italy 1994; Mississippi 1992 ), and the South Africa 2007 trial randomised 4476 women.
In six trials both primiparous and multiparous women were included ( Angola 1992; Austria 1997; Hungary 1988; Mississippi 1992; South Africa 2007; Zurich 1988) while in three trials, only primiparous women were included (China 1997 ; Italy 1994; Memphis 1989 ); this was not clearly specified in Hungary 1979. Women were recruited at various stages in their pregnancies into the included trials.In the Angola 1992 trial, designed for the prevention of pre-eclampsia, women were recruited at any stage during their first four months of pregnancy, whereas in China 1997 , also designed for the prevention of pregnancy-induced hypertension, normal and high-risk women were recruited from 22 weeks' gestation.
Women with low-risk pregnancies were recruited into the Austria 1997 trial before their 18th week of pregnancy, for the prevention of preterm labour; in the Mississippi 1992 trial however, women with risk factors for preterm birth were recruited at a mean gestational age at entry between 23 and 24 weeks. In Hungary 1988 and South Africa 2007, women were recruited at their first antenatal clinic/appointment (in South Africa 2007 the gestational age of women varied from 10 to 35 weeks, with a mean of 21 weeks).In Memphis 1989 women were recruited from between 13 and 24 weeks' gestation, whereas in Italy 1994 and Zurich 1988, women were included at no later than 12 and 16 weeks respectively.Interventions and comparisons In the 10 included trials, the composition of the magnesium supplements, gestational ages at commencement of supplementation, and doses administered varied.
In eight of the trials a placebo supplement (Angola 1992; China 1997 ; Hungary 1988; Italy 1994; Mississippi 1992 ; South Africa 2007) or active control (aspartic acid) (Memphis 1989 ; Zurich 1988) was used; in two trials, no treatment was given to the control group (Austria 1997; Hungary 1979). Magnesium oxide: in one trial ( Angola 1992) women were given two tablets daily of magnesium oxide 500 mg (1000 mg total daily) beginning from no later than four months post-conception.Magnesium citrate: in two trials, women received magnesium citrate tablets (Austria 1997; Hungary 1979).Women in Austria 1997 were given 365 mg of magnesium citrate daily from no later than 18 weeks' gestation until hospitalisation a/f_ter 38 weeks, whereas women in Hungary 1979 received 340 mg of magnesium citrate daily, either before nine weeks' gestation, or from nine to 27 weeks' gestation.Magnesium gluconate: women in two trials received magnesium gluconate (China 1997 ; Mississippi 1992 ).
In China 1997 women received 2 g of magnesium gluconate daily from 28 weeks' gestation to 30 weeks; they then received 3 g daily from 30 weeks until delivery. In Mississippi 1992 women received two 500 mg tablets of magnesium gluconate four times daily (4 g daily total, 215 mg elemental magnesium) from 23 weeks' gestation.Magnesium aspartate: in four trials, women received magnesium aspartate.In Hungary 1988, Italy 1994 and Zurich 1988 women received 15 mmol of magnesium aspartate daily.In Hungary 1988 women received a tablet of 5 mmol three times per day from six to 21 weeks' gestation until birth, whereas in Zurich 1988 women received six tablets daily from no later than 16 weeks' gestation until birth.In Italy 1994 supplementation commenced before 12 weeks' gestation.In Memphis 1989 women received six tablets of magnesium aspartate hydrochloride per day (each containing 60.8 mg elemental magnesium: 365 mg daily) from between 13 to 24 weeks until birth.
Magnesium stearate: in South Africa 2007 women received two 'slow-release' magnesium tablets daily (64 mg elemental magnesium per tablet) from the time of enrolment (10 to 35 weeks; mean: 21 weeks) until birth. Outcomes All of the 10 included trials focused on perinatal outcomes for women and/or their babies (Angola 1992; Austria 1997; China 1997 ; Hungary 1979; Hungary 1988; Italy 1994; Memphis 1989 ; Mississippi 1992; South Africa 2007; Zurich 1988).None of the included studies reported on any longer-term outcomes for the infants.Excluded studies Four studies were excluded as intravenous magnesium sulphate was administered as part of the intervention (Denmark 1990 ; Denmark 1991 ; Detroit 1999; India 2012 ).
Four further trials were excluded (ISRCTN03989660; NCT01709968; Norway 2008; Sweden 1995), as they assessed the eﬀects of oral magnesium supplementation on pregnancy-related leg cramps and therefore have been (or are likely to be) considered for inclusion in the relevant Cochrane review (Garrison 2012 ). One further trial (Sweden 1987) did not assess magnesium, rather assessed calcium and vitamin C for pregnant women with leg cramps.See Characteristics of excluded studies for further details.Risk of bias in included studies We judged the trials to have a moderate risk of bias overall.See Figure 1 and Figure 2./uni00A0 Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy (Review) Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.7 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Figure 1.

Angola 1992 used a table of random numbers; in Austria 1997, Memphis 1989 and South Africa 2007 a computer-generated randomisation list was used. For five trials, the methods used for random sequence generation were unclear (China 1997 ; Hungary 1979; Hungary 1988; Italy 1994; Mississippi 1992 ), and in one trial, allocation was based on the participants' date of birth (Zurich 1988).Only two trials were judged to have adequate methods to conceal allocation (Memphis 1989 ; South Africa 2007).In Memphis 1989 allocation was performed through the hospital pharmacy; in South Africa 2007 research assistants not involved in the care of the women issued consecutive numbers to each participant.For the remaining seven trials, the risk of selection bias due to inadequate allocation concealment was judged as unclear (Angola 1992; Austria 1997; China 1997 ; Hungary 1979; Hungary 1988; Italy 1994; Mississippi 1992 ).
Blinding A placebo was used in six of the 10 trials (Angola 1992; China 1997; Hungary 1988; Italy 1994; Mississippi 1992 ; South Africa 2007); in Memphis 1989 and Zurich 1988 women in the control group received tablets containing aspartic acid. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors was judged to be adequate in five of these eight trials (China 1997 ; Italy 1994; Memphis 1989; Mississippi 1992 ; South Africa 2007).In Angola 1992 whilst a placebo was used, the placebo and magnesium oxide tablets were distributed in diﬀerent quantities to the women, and it was unclear if the tablets were identical in appearance; thus the risk of performance and detection bias were judged as unclear.
In Hungary 1988 the success of blinding of participants and personnel was also judged as unclear, as while a placebo was used, it was unclear whether this was identical in appearance to the magnesium aspartate tablets, and the leader of the study was able to identify of the composition of the tablets by identification marks. In Zurich 1988, while the study was described as "double-blind" and a placebo was used, allocation was based on the participants' date of birth, and thus it was unclear as to whether blinding would have been successfully achieved for personnel, participants and outcome assessors.Austria 1997 was judged to be at a high risk of performance and detection bias with no blinding of participants, personnel or outcome assessors.In Hungary 1979, while no placebo was used, the translation of the manuscript detailed blind outcome assessment.
Incomplete outcome data Three of the nine trials were judged to be at a low risk of attrition bias, with no or minimal post-randomisation exclusions or attrition (China 1997 ; Hungary 1979; Italy 1994). The remaining seven trials were judged to be at an unclear risk of attrition bias (Angola 1992; Austria 1997; Hungary 1988; Memphis 1989 ; Mississippi 1992 ; South Africa 2007; Zurich 1988).In Angola 1992 post-randomisation exclusions were not reported.In Austria 1997, 7.5% of women (25 from the treatment group(9.7%) and 15 (5.7%) from the control group) were excluded for a variety of reasons including lack of compliance and gastro- intestinal problems with supplementation.In Hungary 1988, while only 7/507 and 5/490 women were excluded from the placebo and magnesium groups initially (1.2% total), a further 104/500 (20.8%) were excluded from the placebo group and 85/485 (17.5%) from the magnesium group for a number of reasons including loss to follow-up.
In the Memphis 1989 trial, 11/200 (5.5%) women from the placebo group and 15/200 (7.5%) from the treatment group were excluded as they never started medication. In South Africa 2007, 190 women were excluded post-randomisation, and a further 204 were lost to follow-up (394/4476) and it was not possible to determine to which groups these women were randomised.Similarly in Mississippi 1992 , it was not possible to ascertain from which group(s) the seven (13%) excluded women were originally assigned.Finally in Zurich 1988, the total number of women in each group were not reported in results tables, and it was thus diﬀicult to determine exclusions or attrition; the manuscript detailed that "For various reasons such as refusal to take further tablets, delivery in other hospitals or abortion, some data were not available for analysis".
Selective reporting Only one trial was judged to be at a low risk of selective reporting, with data reported for all pre-specified and/or expected outcomes (Memphis 1989 ). For the remaining nine trials, the risk of reporting bias was judged to be unclear (Angola 1992; Austria 1997; China 1997 ; Hungary 1979; Hungary 1988; Italy 1994; Mississippi 1992; South Africa 2007; Zurich 1988), with for example, no pre- specification of outcomes, important or expected outcomes not reported, or outcome data reported in such a way that it could not be included in a meta-analysis.Other potential sources of bias Five of the trials were judged to be at a low risk of other potential of bias, with no obvious sources of bias identified (Austria 1997; China 1997; Hungary 1979; Italy 1994; Mississippi 1992 ).For the other trials, this was unclear, for example, with high non-compliance (Hungary 1988; South Africa 2007).
Eﬀects of interventions Magnesium supplementation versus no magnesium Primary outcomes Infant outcomes Magnesium supplementation compared with no magnesium supplementation was associated with no significant diﬀerence in the risk of perinatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.67; five trials, 5903 infants) (Analysis 1.1 ), or small-for-gestational age (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07; three trials; 1291 infants; I/two.sups = 7%) (Analysis 1.2 ). For the outcome perinatal mortality, data from the Austria 1997 and Memphis 1989 trials have been included in the meta-analysis; it should be noted, however, that Austria 1997 only reported on stillbirths (and did not report on neonatal deaths), and Memphis 1989 only reported on neonatal deaths (and did not report on stillbirths).
Considering the outcome small-for-gestational age, the definition provided in Hungary 1988 and Zurich 1988 was birthweight below the 10th percentile for gestational age; in Memphis 1989 , no definition was provided. Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy (Review) Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.10 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Maternal outcomes The eﬀect of magnesium supplementation on maternal death was not reported by any of the included studies.No significant diﬀerence in pre-eclampsia was observed between the magnesium supplemented and control groups (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.32; three trials, 1042 women) (Analysis 1.3 ).
The definitions for the three trials reporting on pre-eclampsia varied: in Memphis 1989 pre-eclampsia was defined as "a systolic blood pressure reading of ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 90 mm Hg on two occasions at least 6 hours apart with or without proteinuria, or both"; however in Angola 1992, the definition was "the simultaneous occurrence of the clinical triad of hypertension, edema, and proteinuria at any time during the course of pregnancy"; with hypertension defined as "A rise in systolic BP greater than 30 mm Hg and/or a rise in diastolic BP greater than 15 mm Hg"; proteinuria defined as "Protein greater than one determine by test tape" and oedema defined as "Visible fluid accumulation in the ankles and feet; indentation produced by pressure applied by the thumb over the anterior surface of the tibia." In Zurich 1988, the definition was not clear.
No statistical heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analyses for the primary outcomes (I/two.sups = 0%), excluding small-for-gestational age, where the I/two.sups has been reported above. Secondary outcomes Infant outcomes Magnesium supplementation compared with no magnesium supplementation was associated with no significant diﬀerence in the risk of stillbirth (risk ratio (RR) 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 1.25; four trials, 5526 infants) (Analysis 1.4 ), however, a possible increased risk of neonatal death prior to discharge was seen for the group of infants whose mothers had received magnesium supplementation (RR 2.21; 95% CI 1.02 to 4.75; four trials, 5373 infants) (P = 0.04) (Analysis 1.5 ).The South Africa 2007 trial contributed the majority of participants (more than 70%) to this outcome, with 17 infant deaths occurring in the magnesium supplemented group and seven in the control group.
The authors of the South Africa 2007 trial suggested that the large number of severe congenital anomalies in the supplemented group (accounting for seven of the 17 deaths) and the deaths of two sets of twins (with birthweights of less than 750 g) in the supplemented group likely accounted for the increased risk of death observed with magnesium supplementation, and thus this result should be interpreted with caution. When we excluded the seven deaths due to "congential abnormalities incompatible with life" from the meta-analysis for this outcome, reassuringly, no increased risk of neonatal death was seen for the magnesium supplemented group (RR 1.45; 95% CI 0.63 to 3.32; four trials, 5373 infants) (Analysis 1.5 ).There was no significant diﬀerence between the magnesium supplemented group and the control group for the outcome miscarriage (average RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.49; six trials, 3704 women) (Analysis 1.6 ).
As we identified moderate statistical heterogeneity for this outcome (Tau/two.sups = 0.19; I/two.sups = 44%) a random-eﬀects model was used. It is possible that the diﬀering types of magnesium supplement (and the diﬀering regimens for administration used) across the six included trials (Austria 1997; Hungary 1979; Hungary 1988; Italy 1994; Memphis 1989 ; Zurich 1988) contributed to this moderate level of heterogeneity.Similarly, no significant diﬀerences between the magnesium supplemented group and the control group were observed for the outcomesgestational age at birth (mean diﬀerence (MD) 0.06 weeks; 95% CI -0.07 to 0.20; five trials; 5564 women) (Analysis 1.7 ) and preterm birth (average RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.14; seven trials; 5981 women; Tau/two.sups = 0.04; I/two.sups = 37%) (Analysis 1.8 ).
Five trials reported on low birthweight infants of less than 2500 g and revealed no significant diﬀerence in the incidence of low birthweight with magnesium supplementation (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09; 5577 infants) (Analysis 1.9 ). One trial ( Zurich 1988) reported data relating to very low birthweight infants (less than 1500 g), with no observed eﬀect of maternal magnesium supplementation (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.13 to 2.07).No diﬀerence in mean birthweight between the two groups was observed (MD 22.21 g; 95% CI -27.23 to 71.65; five trials, 5564 infants) (Analysis 1.10 ).As we identified moderate statistical heterogeneity for this outcome (Tau/two.sups = 1138.34; I/two.sups = 38%) a random-eﬀects model was used.Magnesium supplementation was not shown to be associated with a diﬀerence in admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.11; three trials, 1435 infants) (Analysis 1.11 ).
Disability at paediatric follow-up was not reported by any of the included trials. Non pre-specified infant outcomes We have reported data on a number of outcomes relating to neonatal morbidity that were not pre-specified in the original review protocol, but that we considered to be clinically relevant and important to include in this update.
Magnesium supplementation was not shown to be associated with any diﬀerences considering the outcomes of a one-minute Apgar score less than five (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.67; one trial, 377 infants) (Analysis 1.12 ), meconium aspiration (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.26; one trial, 4082 infants) (Analysis 1.15 ), breech presentation (RR 1.25; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.92; one trial, 4082 infants) (Analysis 1.16 ), placental abruption (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.94; one trial, 4082 infants) (Analysis 1.17 ), placental weight (MD -0.01 g; 95% CI -22.16 to 22.14; two trials, 4459 infants; Tau/two.sups = 113.95; I/two.sups = 36%) (Analysis 1.18), any hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.34; one trial, 4082 infants), moderate HIE (RR 1.02; 05% CI 0.26 to 4.09; one trial, 4082 infants), severe HIE (RR 2.56; 95% CI 0.50 to 13.19; one trial, 4082 infants) (Analysis 1.19 ), or significant congenital abnormalities (RR 2.05; 95% CI 0.77 to 5.45; one trial, 4082 infants) (Analysis 1.20 ).
Magnesium supplementation was, however, shown to reduce the risk of a five-minute Apgar score less than seven (RR 0.34; 05% CI 0.15 to 0.80; four trials, 1083 infants) (Analysis 1.12 ). Significant reductions in late fetal heart rate decelerations (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.88) (Analysis 1.13 ), meconium-stained liquor (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99) (Analysis 1.14 ), and mild HIE (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98) (Analysis 1.19 ) were also observed with magnesium supplementation in one trial of 4082 infants (South Africa 2007).Maternal outcomes There were no data available from any of the trials relating to maternal acceptance of treatment.
Of the five trials reporting maternal side eﬀects of treatment (Hungary 1988; Italy 1994; Memphis 1989 ; Mississippi 1992 ; Zurich 1988), four reported on gastro-intestinal symptoms and found no significant diﬀerence between the magnesium supplemented group and control group Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy (Review) Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.11 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.12; 1388 women) (Analysis 1.21 ).The Mississippi 1992 trial reported that no women in either group had any side eﬀects.
Magnesium supplementation was associated with a significantly higher systolic blood pressure near birth (MD 1.00 mm Hg; 95% CI 0.03 to 1.97; three trials, 1432 women) (Analysis 1.22 ), however no significant diﬀerences in diastolic blood pressure (MD 0.23 mm Hg; 95% CI -0.67 to 1.13; three trials, 1432 women) (Analysis 1.23), or pregnancy-induced hypertension (average RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.11 to 1.41; three trials, 4284 women) (Analysis 1.24 ) were observed between groups. Substantial statistical heterogeneity was observed for the outcome pregnancy-induced hypertension (Tau/two.sups = 0.98; I/two.sups = 77%), and thus a random-eﬀects model was used.
It is possible that the diﬀering types of magnesium supplement (and the diﬀering regimens for administration used) across the three included trials, or variation between trials in the definitions used for this outcome contributed to this level of heterogeneity (with only the Angola 1992 trial providing a clear definition: a rise in systolic blood pressure > 30 mm Hg and/or a rise in diastolic blood pressure > 15 mm Hg during the course of the pregnancy). Furthermore, the Angola 1992 and China 1997 trials, which showed benefit for the outcome pregnancy-induced hypertension with magnesium supplementation, were of comparatively small sample sizes (150 and 102 women respectively), and judged to be of a lower quality than the South Africa 2007 trial, of 4476 women, which did not show a diﬀerence between groups.
Three trials assessed the need for maternal hospitalisation and demonstrated a reduced need with magnesium supplementation compared with no treatment (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86; 1158 women) (Analysis 1.26 ). No diﬀerence between magnesium supplementation and no treatment was shown for the outcomes eclampsia (RR 0.14; 95% CI 0.01 to 2.70; one trial, 100 women) (Analysis 1.25 ), length of labour (MD -0.00 hours; 95% CI -0.50 to 0.50; two trials, 4650 women) (Analysis 1.28 ) or antepartum haemorrhage (average RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.09 to 3.15; two trials.942 women) (Analysis 1.27 ).It is possible that the Zurich 1988 trial's low quality (being quasi-randomised, with unclear blinding) contributed to the substantial statistical heterogeneity observed for the outcome antepartum haemorrhage (Tau/two.sups = 1.12; I/two.sups = 67%).The incidence of postpartum haemorrhage was not reported by the included studies.
Subgroup analysis based on type of magnesium supplement Subgroup analysis based on the type of magnesium supplement used, revealed no subgroup diﬀerences for the outcome perinatal mortality (Chi/two.sups = 0.33; P = 0.85; I/two.sups = 0%) (Analysis 1.1 ). We were not able to perform a subgroup analysis for small-for-gestational age, as all the trials that reported on this outcome used magnesium aspartate (Analysis 1.2 ).Similarly, subgroup analysis based on the type of magnesium supplement used revealed no subgroup diﬀerences for pre- eclampsia (Chi/two.sups = 1.03; P = 0.31; I/two.sups = 3.1%) ( Analysis 1.3 ).
Subgroup analysis based on study design Subgroup analysis based on the study designed used (cluster-randomised versus individually-randomised), revealed no subgroup diﬀerences for the primary outcomes, perinatal mortality (Chi/two.sups = 0.12; P = 0.73; I/two.sups = 0%) ( Analysis 2.1 ), and small-for-gestational age (Chi/two.sups = 1.93; P = 0.16; I/two.sups = 48.3%) (Analysis 2.2 ). We were not able to perform a subgroup analysis for pre-eclampsia, as the three trials that reported on this outcome were all individually- randomised.Sensitivity analysis - varying the ICC for the cluster- randomised trial We conducted a sensitivity analysis using less conservative estimates of the ICC for mortality outcomes (0.0002, 0.002) (less conservative when considering the ICC of 0.02 used throughout the main analysis).
Although selecting less conservative ICC values (assuming less clustering and thereby increasing the weight of the one included cluster-randomised trial (Hungary 1988)) narrowed the confidence intervals slightly, overall this did not have a serious impact on the findings (Analysis 3.1 ; Analysis 3.2 ; Analysis 3.3 ). Sensitivity analysis by quality rating Only two trials had an allocation concealment and sequence generation rating of 'low risk of bias' (Memphis 1989 ; South Africa 2007).
The sensitivity analysis excluded trials with an allocation concealment and/or sequence generation rating of 'unclear' or 'high risk of bias.' Among the 'high quality studies' there were no significant diﬀerences between the magnesium supplemented group and control group for the outcomes perinatal mortality (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.65; two trials, 4459 infants) (Analysis 4.1 ) small-for-gestational age (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.33 to 1.77; one trial, 377 infants) (Analysis 4.2 ) or pre-eclampsia (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.44; one trial, 374 women) (Analysis 4.3 ), as in the main analysis. D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results The meta-analysis of trials included in this review indicated no statistically significant eﬀects of magnesium supplementation on the frequency of perinatal mortality or small-for-gestational age infants when compared with placebo or no treatment.
Similarly, the results of this review indicated that magnesium supplementation during pregnancy had no significant eﬀect on pre-eclampsia; maternal deaths were not reported by the included trials. For secondary outcomes, many of the included studies did not provide data, and where they did, mostly we did not detect diﬀerences between the magnesium supplemented and control groups.It is important to note that for some outcomes, the definitions used by individual trials were unclear and/or varied, such as for the outcomes pre-eclampsia, small-for-gestational age and pregnancy-induced hypertension.Some results did appear to show diﬀerences between the groups.Magnesium supplementation was shown to result in fewer maternal hospitalisations during pregnancy; and while higher maternal systolic blood pressure near birth was shown for the magnesium supplemented group of women, this observed mean diﬀerence in blood pressure of 1 mm Hg is considered unlikely to be clinically significant.
For both outcomes the Zurich 1988 trial significantly influenced the meta-analysis; and as this trial was of low quality, being quasi-randomised with women allocated according to their date of birth, and thus these findings should be interpreted with caution. While no significant diﬀerence between groups was shown for the outcome stillbirth, on meta-analysis, a possible increased risk of neonatal death prior to discharge Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy (Review) Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.12 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was observed for infants born to mothers who had received magnesium supplementation.It is important to highlight that only four of the 10 trials included in this review reported data to include in the meta-analysis for this outcome.
Furthermore, in the South Africa 2007 trial (which contributed over 70% of the participants to the analysis for this outcome), the trial authors documented a high number of severe congenital anomalies in the supplemented group (unlikely attributable to magnesium, as none of these seven infants had been exposed to magnesium prior to the 19th week of gestation) and the deaths of two sets of twins (with birthweights of less than 750 g) in the supplemented group. When the deaths due to "congenital abnormalities incompatible with life" (including thanatophoric dwarf, anencephaly, hypoplastic le/f_t heart, hypoplastic lungs, and multiple abnormalities) were excluded from the meta-analysis for this outcome, reassuringly, no increased risk of neonatal death was seen for the magnesium supplemented group.
When only high-quality trials were included in the analysis, there was no eﬀect of magnesium supplementation on the frequency of perinatal mortality, small-for-gestational age, or pre-eclampsia (Memphis 1989 ; South Africa 2007). One of the highest quality trials, Memphis 1989 , of 400 women, demonstrated no eﬀect of maternal magnesium supplementation on blood pressure, pre- eclampsia or other pregnancy outcomes.The results of this trial may have however been influenced by the fact that all women (both magnesium supplemented and placebo groups) received a multivitamin and mineral preparation containing 100 mg of magnesium.
For the outcomes small-for-gestational age and pre- eclampsia, only the Memphis 1989 trial reported data for inclusion in the sensitivity analysis, and this study was underpowered to detect diﬀerences between groups for both of these outcomes, with considerable uncertainly about the treatment eﬀects observed; unfortunately the South Africa 2007, of over 4000 women, did not report on small-for-gestational age or pre-eclampsia. The South Africa 2007 trial found no diﬀerence in meconium aspiration, breech presentation, placental abruption, congenital abnormalities, moderate or severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) and neonatal encephalopathy between the magnesium supplemented and placebo groups however it found that magnesium supplementation reduced the risk of late fetal heart decelerations, meconium-stained liquor and mild HIE (South Africa 2007).
These outcomes relating to infant morbidity were not pre-specified in the original protocol for the review, and while the review authors believed their reporting in this update to be important, they acknowledge the potential for bias associated with the reporting of non pre-specified review outcomes. Quality of the evidence There is a lack of high-quality evidence assessing the use of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy.Only two trials were judged to be at a low risk of selection bias, with adequate methods to conceal allocation and to generate a random sequence (Memphis 1989 ; South Africa 2007); the remaining trials were largely judged to be at an unclear risk of selection bias.Only four of the 10 trials were judged at a low risk of both performance and detectionbias (Italy 1994; Memphis 1989 ; Mississippi 1992 ; South Africa 2007), and for the Austria 1997 trial, the risk of performance and detection bias was judged as high, with no control/placebo treatment used.
The majority of trials were judged at an unclear risk of attrition bias and reporting bias. Potential biases in the review process The evidence for this review is derived from trials identified through a detailed search process.It is possible (but unlikely) that additional trials assessing magnesium supplementation during pregnancy, have been published but not identified.It is also possible that other studies have been conducted but not published.Should such studies be identified, we will include them in future updates of this review.A U T H O R S ' /uni00A0 C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice There is currently no evidence to support magnesium supplementation during pregnancy for improving maternal and neonatal/infant health outcomes.Until additional evidence from large, well-designed randomised trials becomes available, current evidence is insuﬀicient to make recommendations for routine clinical practice on the use of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy.
Implications for research In light of the limited current evidence, further randomised controlled trials may be warranted to determine whether supplementation with magnesium during pregnancy can improve maternal and neonatal/infant health outcomes. Such trials must be suﬀiciently powered, and well-designed to allow important diﬀerences to be detected.Future research must consider relevant maternal and neonatal/infant outcomes (including reporting on maternal and perinatal mortality), as well as longer- term paediatric outcomes (including disabilities).In addition to assessing eﬀectiveness and safety, such trials may address specific considerations including timing of commencement of supplementation and dosage.

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and contains trials identified from: 1.quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); 2.weekly searches of MEDLINE; 3.handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences 4.weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals 5.plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts. Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL and MEDLINE, the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the ‘Specialized Register’ section within the editorial information about the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.Trials identified through the searching activities described above are each assigned to a review topic (or topics).The Trials Search Co- ordinator searches the register for each review using the topic list rather than keywords.
In addition, we searched The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using the terms: magnesium and pregnan* or pre-eclamp* or pre eclamp* or preeclamp* or hypertens* or preterm or premature. The Controlled Trials Register was last searched in June 2001.We did not apply any language restrictions.Data collection and analysis Included trial data were processed as described in Clarke 2000.Trials under consideration were evaluated for inclusion and methodological quality, without consideration of their results.This was separately assessed by each author.Discrepancies were resolved by discussion.There was no blinding of authorship.Quality scores for concealment of allocation were assigned to each trial, using the criteria described in Section 6 of the Cochrane Handbook (Clarke 2000).A = adequate, B = unclear, C = inadequate, D = not used.
In addition, quality scores were assigned to each trial for use of placebo, blinding of outcome assessment and completeness of follow- up as follows: Use of placebo: (A) placebo - yes; (B) placebo attempted; (C) no placebo; (D) unclear. For blinding of assessment of outcome: (A) Double-blind, neither investigator nor participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated treatment.(B) Single-blind, either the investigator or the participant knew the allocation.Or, the trial is described as double-blind but side eﬀects of one or other treatment mean that it is likely that for a significant proportion (</= 20%) of participants the allocation could be correctly identified.(C) No blinding, both investigator and participant knew (or were likely to guess) the allocated treatment.(D) Unclear.Completeness of follow-up: (A) < 3% of participants excluded; (B) 3% - 9.9% of participants excluded; (C) 10% - 19.9% of participants excluded; (D) 20% or more of participants excluded; (E) unclear.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.51 Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Data were independently extracted by the two reviewers and double entered.Discrepancies were resolved by discussion.Whenever possible, unpublished data were sought from investigators.All eligible trials were included in the initial analysis.Sensitivity analysis was planned to evaluate the eﬀect of trial quality by including trials given quality scores of A for allocation concealment, use of placebo, and blinding of primary outcome assessment and an A or B score for completeness of follow-up.The meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed-eﬀect model (Meta-View 4.1).
Summary statistics for dichotomous variables are reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals, while summary statistics for continuous variables are reported as weighted mean diﬀerence with 95% confidence intervals. F E E D B A C K Gelband, April 2000 Summary Methods of the review: The largest trial in this review, Hungary 1998, was a cluster randomised trial with clinics as the unit of randomisation.The data appear to have been entered as though randomisation was by individual, without any adjustment for the cluster design.This is of particular concern as some results ware borderline for statistical significance, which might not be the case if the data were adjusted for cluster design.[Summary of comments from Hellen Gelband, April 2000] Reply The review now includes two meta-analyses, one including the Hungrian trial and one excluding the Hungarian trial.
We preferred this approach to the total exclusion of the Hungarian trial because it is the largest trial included in the review. When the Hungarian trial is excluded from the meta-analysis, three of six outcomes that were significantly diﬀerent between treatment and placebo when all trials are included are no longer diﬀerent.These outcomes are the frequency of preterm birth (< 37 weeks' gestation), the frequency of low birthweight and the frequency of small for gestational age.These findings are discussed in the review.[Summary of response from Maria Makrides, Caroline Crowther and Simon Gates, June 2001] Contributors Hellen Gelband W H A T ' S /uni00A0 N E W /uni00A0 Date Event Description 9 May 2019 Amended Edited Declarations of interest section.
