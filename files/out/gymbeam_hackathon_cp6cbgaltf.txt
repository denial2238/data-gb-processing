The details of KJare also found in Upa- vana vinoda, an anthropological compilation called ‘Sharangadhara Paddhati ’written by Acharya Sharangadhara , belonging to the 13th century. The dictionary meaning of the Sanskrit word Kunapa is “smelling like a dead body or stinking ”.The manure Kunapambu or KJ, was appropriately named because it involved fermentation of animal remains, such as ﬂesh, marrow etc.with stinking smell [2,3] .Vrikshayurveda ofSurapala mentions varieties of KJ.The verse 101 mentions that excreta, bone marrow, brain, ﬂesh and blood of animals are mixed with water and kept as it is for some time to be known as KJ.In the subsequent verses it is quoted that bones of horses, dead parrot, ﬁsh, horns of sheep and goat, cow dung cake should be boiled in water and later ﬁlled along with suf ﬁcient quantity of husk in a previously oil smeared pot.Instead of boiling, it can also be roasted in an iron pot and mixed with sesame oil cakes and honey.

Another Vrikshayurveda texts Upavana Vinoda explains the prepa- ration of KJin the verses 171 e174 as, ﬂesh of wild animals should be boiled until properly cooked and transferred to an earthen pot, then tila, honey and ghee should be added followed by hot water. The pot should be kept in warm place for 15 days and the resultant liquid is called KJ[5].It is found that, the daily application of KJhas improved the soil fertility and plant growth [6].The application of Dhanyagavya prepared by using cow dung, water and paddy husk helped to eradicate the pest affecting the tea leaves [6].I nVrikshayurveda , several suggestions have been made for enhancing plant growth and for protecting them against diseases.KJis one such pre- scription, which has been recommended for stimulating growth and development of plants.Administration of KJevery 10thand 15thday, exhibited remarkable enhancement in paddy growth [7].
Besides the classical texts, few modern literatures also sug- gested to ful ﬁll the nutrient needs to achieve good yield by the application of animal remnants in the form of meat meal, blood meal, ﬁshmeal etc. [8]A study conducted on Langali ( Gloriosa superba Linn.) revealed, application of modi ﬁedKJwas better in terms of yield in comparision with control and the group culti- vated as per the modern agricultural guidelines [9].O r g a n i c farming was a well-developed and systematized agricultural practice during the past and this wisdom was obtained through the Vedas , which specify the use of ‘Pancha gavya ’(PG)i na g r i - culture for the health of soil, plants and humans.It is the blend of ﬁve products obtained from cow, namely, dung, urine, milk, curd and ghee.PGis used in different forms such as foliar spray, soil application, seed or seedling treatment etc.
[10] There have been reports on modi ﬁed formulations of PGand it is found to enhance the biological ef ﬁciency of the plants, improved quality of fruits and vegetables [11]. It has also increased the soil fertility [12].Shailaja et al.reported the potential of PGas biofertilizer on Spinacia oleracea ; there was an increase in biomass, shoot length and root length in PGtreated plants, and the total viable count and total bacterial count of Rhizobium ,Azospirillum and Actino- mycetes were enhanced in PGtreated soil [13].Sarkar et al.proved the ef ﬁcacy of KJand PGindividually and in combination in promoting the growth and yield attributes of vegetable crops namely, tomato, chilli and cow pea [14].Humic acid improves soil fertility and increases availability of nutrient elements by holding surfaces and consequently affecting plant growth and yield [15e17].The role of 16 essential plant nutrients for plant growth or crop production is well established [18].
Germination studies are essential to predict the growth and development of plants. The successful cultivation of plants depend on the quality and germination behavior of the seeds.Among the stages of plant life cycles, seed germination is one of the most key processes in plant growth and survival [19].The present study was planned to validate KJand PGonAsh- wagandha and Kalamegha as these medicinal plants are mentioned in several Ayurvedic literatures for their wider utility [20].Besides, both these plants have been identi ﬁed by the National Medicinal Plant Board (NMPB) of India in the thirty two selected priority medicinal plants, which are in great demand in domestic and in- ternational markets [21].Hence, the present study was aimed to validate the Vrikshayurveda practices viz.KJand PGby nutrient analysis and evaluated on the germination parameters in compar- ison with other treatment groups vizcontrol, farmyard manure, humic acid and NPK.2.Materials and methods 2.1.
Seeds and other raw materials Mature seeds of Ashwagandha (variety: Jawahar Ashwagandha 20) were procured from local market. Kalamegha seeds were pro- cured from Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, Anand (GJ), India.Other raw materials required for preparation of KJ,PG, farmyard manure, commercial brand humic acid and the NPK (in the form of urea, diammonium phosphate and muriate of potash respectively) were procured from local manufacturers.2.2.Preparation of Kunapa jala (KJ) Vrikshayurveda texts have explained various preparations of KJ based on the types of ingredients involved.According to Shar- angadhara [4]and as explained by Sadhale [2], the KJwas prepared with minor modi ﬁcations.According to availability of ingredients, 1.5 kg each of sheep/goat meat, chicken meat and 1 kg of Indian mackerel ﬁsh (Rastrelliger kanagurta ) were boiled in 16 L of water till properly cooked and transferred to an earthen pot.
Each 500 g powders of black gram ( Vigna mungo L.) and sesame ( Sesamum indicum L.) were added along with milk (1 L), honey (500 g) and ghee (250 g). The pot was closed with lid and kept in warm place for 30 days with stirring at regular intervals.The content of the pot was ﬁltered on 31stday and the resultant ﬁltrate was KJ.For application to seeds, 10% of KJwas used.2.3.Preparation of Pancha gavya (PG) PGwas prepared referring to the method explained by De et al.[22] with minor modi ﬁcation in quantity of ingredients prepared by Shri Kshetra Revana Siddeshwara Goshala, Hunasevari, Belagavi (KA), India.All ingredients were collected from native Indian breed cow.20 kg of dung, 10 L each of urine and of tap water were added in an earthen pot and kept for 15 days with stirring every day for an hour in clockwise and anticlockwise direction.On 16thday 5 kg of ghee was added, thoroughly mixed by stirring every day and keptfor 5 more days.
On 21 stday, 10 L each of milk and curd were added and stirred every day till 30thday. On 31stday the content of the pot wasﬁltered.For application to seeds, 10% of PGwas used.2.4.Determination of nutrient contents The pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were determined using pH and EC meter.Determination of macro and micro elements were estimated using atomic absorption techniques and nitrogen con- tent was estimated according to Kjeldahl method [23].Nutrient contents were estimated for KJand PG; same have been compared with organic group (FYM and HA).2.5.Germination parameters The germination parameters of Vrikshayurveda method groups (KJand PG) were observed in comparison with organic (FYM and HA), inorganic (NPK) and control groups.Initially both the seeds were washed with 0.1% HgCl 2for 2 min and rinsed with distilled water for 30 min.
In each group, 50 seeds were placed on sterile ﬁlter paper disc in petri dishes of 15 cm diameter.10% of KJ,PG, FYM, HA, NPK and control treatments were given to respective plates. Germination parameters were determined by the methods given by Srivastava et al.[24] viz.germinability (G %), germination rate index (GRI), emergence index (EI), relative seed germination (RSG), relative root elongation (RRE) and seedling vigor index (SVI).PlatesG.M.Ankad et al./ Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine 9 (2018) 13 e19 14 were observed for 30 days with appropriate irrigation at regular intervals and parameters were recorded.2.6.Statistical analysis Germination parameters were studied in triplicates; data in the experiments were expressed as mean ±SD for three sample rep- licates (n ¼3).Means of results of germination parameters ob- tained were compared against control group for signi ﬁcance using Dunnett multiple comparision test using GraphPad InStat software.
Differences were considered signi ﬁcant at p<0.05, extremely signiﬁcant at p<0.01 and non-signi ﬁcant at p>0.05 level. 3.Results At the end of 30thday of incubation, the resultant liquids KJand PGwere light brown and greyish black respectively with charac- teristic pungent odour.KJhad pH 5.793, EC 2.653 dS/m while PG had pH 5.584, EC 2.216 dS/m.The estimation of nutrient contents forKJand PGwere estimated and compared with organic groups viz.FYM and HA.Results reveled that KJpossessed higher quantities of N, K, S, Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, Mn and Cu followed by PG, HA and FYM.Similarly, PGpossessed higher quantity of P, which was followed by KJ, HA and FYM.The results of germination parameters of Ashwagandha and Kalamegha seeds in KJand PGalong with control, FYM, HA and NPK treatment groups are presented in Figs.1 e9.Fig.1 shows onset of germination.
Ashwagandha seeds treated with KJand PGgermi- nated on 4thday where as Kalamegha seeds treated with KJand PG germinated on 5thand 6thday respectively. However, faster germination was observed in NPK treated Ashwagandha and Kala- megha seeds, i.e on 3rdand 4thday respectively, whereas germi- nation delayed in both seeds in control group than Vrikshayurveda groups.At the end of 30thday, root length ( Fig.2 ) and shoot length (Fig.3 ) were recorded.In Ashwagandha highest root length was observed in NPK group (3.17 ±0.13 cm) followed by KJ (3.13±0.17 cm).Similarly in Kalamegha, highest root length was observed in NPK group (3.00 ±0.14 cm) followed by KJ (2.97 ±0.17 cm).Results of shoot length indicated, highest shoot length in Ashwagandha was observed in NPK group (2.57 ±0.97 cm) followed by KJ(2.54 ±0.95 cm).Similarly in Kalamegha highest shoot length was observed in NPK group (3.37 ±1.04 cm) followed byKJ(3.30 ±1.04 cm).
InAshwagandha, NPK treatment in ﬂuenced G% (84 ±1.63%), GRI (2.80 ±0.05), EI (4.90 ±0.22), RSG (126.21 ±6.03%) RRE (110.48 ±2.94%) and SVI (218.53 ±16.08) followed by KJ (82.67 ±0.94%, 2.76 ±0.03, 4.86 ±0.06, 124.21 ±5.76%, 109.60 ±9.26% and 209.40 ±16.74 respectively) and PG (76.73 ±1.78%, 2.71 ±0.06, 4.54 ±0.11, 122.07 ±2.13%, 106.98 ±14.58% and 189.69 ±23.59 respectively) treatment. Re- sults are presented in Fig 4e9.InA.paniculata NPK treatment in ﬂuenced G% (79.49 ±0.76%) as compared to KJ(78.18 ±1.49%) and PG(76.09 ±1.78%) groups.GRI was highest in FYM (3.56 ±0.03) as compared to KJ (2.87 ±0.05) and PG(2.33 ±0.05) groups.EI and SVI were in ﬂu- enced by NPK (6.26 ±0.15 and 267.54 ±5.00 respectively) as compared to KJ(4.84 ±0.08 and 258.00 ±22.72 respectively) and PG(4.10±0.12 and 242.90 ±22.34 respectively) groups.RSG was inﬂuenced by FYM (155.38 ±3.04 %) as compared to KJ (125.27 ±2.94%) and PG(101.93 ±1.37%) treated groups.RRE was observed to be highest in KJ(124.40 ±24.10%).
Results are pre- sented in Fig 4e9. 4.Discussion Vrikshayurveda has clearly outlined a systematized agricultural practice that insisted of use of KJand PGto enhance the yield and quality of plants.Though, both the practices have been elaborated inVrikshayurveda, there are very few studies conducted to evaluate their ef ﬁcacy on medicinal plants.Previously, no systematic research was undertaken to develop comprehensive standard operative procedure for the preparation of KJand PG,due to the variation in ingredients and their quantity involved in preparation.Though preparation of KJand PGseem to be expensive due to type of ingredients used, however these age old preparations are used for application to soil or plants in their diluted forms and hence arecost-effective.The pH of PGis acidic in nature, and was similar to the reports of Gore et al .and Shailaja et al.; the acidic nature might be due to presence of Lactobacillus bacteria [25,26] .
The results of nutrient content of the present study are in accordance with the results obtained by Jeng et al., where, meat bone meals contain substantial amounts of organic matter and nutritive elements such as N, P and Ca[27]. Similarly, KJderived from animal products containing one or more nutrients like N, P and K are necessary for plant growth (Table 1 ), which is in accordance with Shaikh et al .and Gupta [28,29] .PGcontained appropriate amount of nutrients; the results are in compliance with the study made by Geetha et al.[30] and as mentioned by Shubha et al.[31], the nutrient values of KJand PG may vary according to the quantity, quality of ingredients used and duration of fermentation [25].There are no speci ﬁc references on KJand PGas germination enhancers.A study conducted by Khanna et al.
on effect of physical and chemical treatments on germination behavior revealed that seeds treated with 150 mg/mL gibberellic acid took 4 days for onset of germination and the germination percentage was 98% [32]. In another study conducted by Afsan et al .,germination percentage of GA 3(500 mg/L) applied seeds of Ashwagandha was 86 ±0.34% [33], wherein present study KJ and PG treated Ashwagandha seeds onset to germinate on 4thday and germination percentage of both the groups was 82.66 ±0.94% and 76.73 ±1.77% respectively.Fig.4 shows, highest germination percentage was achieved in inorganic group (84.00 ±1.63%) while that in control group was lowest Fig.1.Onset of germination.G.M.Ankad et al./ Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine 9 (2018) 13 e19 15 (72.46 ±2.71%).In Kalamegha , Rawat et al.
reported that, seeds treated with GA3 (75 ppm) began to germinate on 3rdday with 82% of germination [34] and according to Kumari et al .the highestgermination (99.2% and 88.3%) in the variety CIM-Megha and wild, respectively was expressed after treatment with GA 3(200 ppm) [35].Fig. 4 shows, highest germination percentage was achieved in Fig.3.Shoot length.Fig.4.Germinability.Fig.2.Root length.G.M.Ankad et al./ Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine 9 (2018) 13 e19 16 NPK group (79.48 ±0.72%) followed by KJ(78.18 ±1.48%) and PG (76.08 ±1.77%).Fig.5 shows, highest GRI in Ashwagandha was observed in NPK (2.80 ±0.05) followed by KJ(2.76±0.03), similarlyhighest GRI in Kalamegha was observed FYM (3.56 ±0.03) followed by NPK (3.44 ±0.03) and KJ(2.87±0.05).Fig.6 shows, highest EI in Ashwagandha was observed in NPK (4.90 ±0.06) followed by KJ Fig.5.Germination rate index.Fig.6.Emergence index.Fig.7.Relative seed germination.G.M.Ankad et al.
/ Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine 9 (2018) 13 e19 17 (4.86 ±0.22), similarly highest EI in Kalamegha was observed in NPK (6.26 ±0.15) followed by FYM (5.72 ±0.03) and KJ (4.84 ±0.08). Fig.7 shows, highest RSG in Ashwagandha was observed in NPK (126.21 ±6.03%) followed by KJ(124.21 ±5.76%), similarly highest RSG in Kalamegha was observed in FYM (155.38 ±3.04%) followed by NPK (150.50 ±1.82%) and KJ (125.27 ±2.94%).Fig.8 shows, highest RRE in Ashwagandha was observed in NPK (110.48 ±2.94%) followed by KJ(109.60 ±9.26%),similarly highest RRE in Kalamegha was observed in KJ (124.40 ±24.10%) followed by NPK (124.38 ±15.18%).A study conducted by Christian indicates, SVI of fresh seeds of Ashwagandha treated with GA 3(10/C05M) was 330.0 [36], whereas the present study reports the SVI ( Fig.9 )o fKJand PGgroups was 209.40 ±16.74 and 189.68 ±23.58 respectively.5.Conclusion Conclusively, in both the seeds, highest germination was observed in NPK (inorganic) treated group.
However, in comparison with organic treated and control groups, Vrikshayurveda treatments yielded better results, which can be attributed to their higher nutrient content. To the best of author's knowledge, this is the ﬁrst comprehensive systematic report on preparation of KJand PGand also to comparatively study their effect on germination of Ashwa- gandha and Kalamegha .The work also gives a signi ﬁcant statistical implication on the study.Further studies are needed to assess the microbial population responsible for ef ﬁcacy of KJand PG.The ef- ﬁcacy of the Vrikshayurveda practices through ﬁeld studies on these medicinal plants is in progress.Fig.8.Relative root elongation.Fig.9.Seedling vigor index.Table 1 Nutrient analysis.
