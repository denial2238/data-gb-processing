This review addresses the existing evidence that probiotics are beneﬁcial to healthy people. Our approach was to perform a descriptive review of ef ﬁcacy evidence that probiotics can prevent urinary, vaginal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory infections, and improve risk factors associated with cardiovascular health or reduce antibiotic use.Other endpoints such as mental, dental, or immune health were not speci ﬁcally addressed.We concluded that there is suf ﬁcient evidence of efﬁcacy and safety for clinicians and consumers to consider using speci ﬁc probiotics for some indications –such as the use of probiotics to support gut function during antibiotic use or to reduce the risk of respiratory tract infections –for certain people.However, we did not ﬁnd a sufﬁciently high level of evidence to support unconditional, population-wide recommendations for other preventive endpoints we reviewed for healthy people.
Although evidence for some indications is suggestive of the preventive bene ﬁts of probiotics, additional research is needed.

Introduction Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health bene ﬁt on the host [ 1].Probiotics are widely used by consumers, endorsed by several guidelines, and often recommended by clinicians [ 2]. Reviews have addressed evidence-based use of probiotics for a variety ofconditions, including for healthy and patient populations.
Ran-domized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted for a va-riety of outcomes, including necrotizing enterocolitis, pouchitis,irritable bowel syndrome, and others, and probiotic use in family Abbreviations: AAD, antibiotic-associated diarrhea; BV, bacterial vaginosis; CI, con ﬁdence interval; CVD, cardiovascular disease; GI, gastrointestinal; GRADE, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation; ISAPP, International Scienti ﬁc Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics; RCT, randomized controlled trial; RR, relative risk; RTI, respiratory tract infections; TD, travelers ’diarrhea; USPSTF, United States Preventive Services Task Force; UTI, urinary tract infections; WGO, World Gastroenterology Organization. * Corresponding author.E-mail address: Maryellen@isappscience.org (M.E.

”In fact, there are few recommen- dations for anyintervention to be used by people who are free of any underlying disease. Such interventions must have suf ﬁ- cient evidence of bene ﬁt and relatively little to no harm.In raising this question for probiotics, we considered the approachof an organization tasked with evaluating preventive evidence:the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).Because an important component of a USPSTF review is thepotential for harm, it is important to note here that expertsconsidering the safety of probiotics recently concluded that commonly used probiotic strains are safe for use in the general population [ 4].The USPSTF makes evidence-based recommendations for clinical preventive services, including screenings, counseling,and preventive medications, most often for healthy people orsubgroups of patients.Their reviews utilize an approach that isrigorous, systematic, objective, and evidence-based while eval-uating bene ﬁts and harms.
Recommendations address services offered in a primary care setting and are given grades of A, B, C,D, or I. If A or B grade is given, it is suggested that the service beprovided.The D grade means the service should be discouraged, and an I grade means there is insuf ﬁcient evidence to make a determination.The C grade means no recommendation for oragainst routine provision of the service because the bene ﬁts do not outweigh the potential harms [ 5].The USPSTF recognizes that preventive measures are dif ﬁ- cult to study.Healthy people recruited into a study are oftenunlikely to become unhealthy, especially over the short term.So studies must either be long-term or must identify more im-mediate endpoints, such as validated biomarkers or infectiousdisease, as targets for prevention.Furthermore, the threshold ofevidence for recommending any intervention to a healthy population has to be very high, partially due to the potential risk of harm.
In a patient with an illness, a risk of harm may betolerable if the bene ﬁt outweighs risk. However, in an asymp- tomatic individual, this threshold is more dif ﬁcult to determine.Some preventive measures are widely believed by the generalpublic to be effective, but upon scrutiny of the data have beenfound to lack supporting evidence.For example, a systematicapproach to evaluating evidence led the USPSTF to concludethat there is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend a daily multivitamin for the prevention of cancer or cardiovasculardisease (CVD) [ 6].As one would expect for recommendations for healthy people, the USPSTF imposes a high bar for required evidence.We assembled a group of experts to explore available evi- dence (studies summarized in Table 1 )[7–43] using a similar framework of USPSTF ’s approach to assessing outcomes in healthy people.We also discussed the research needed to closeevidence gaps.
Our primary focus was healthy people, but wealso considered at-risk populations or population subgroupswhere recommendations may be justi ﬁed. A previous review addressed whether healthy people should take a probioticsupplement, but the focus of that article was an improvement in speciﬁc bacteria in the gut microbiota, whereas we evaluated outcomes that are clinically relevant [ 44].Methods The meeting to discuss this topic was convened under the auspices of the International Scienti ﬁc Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP).ISAPP is a nonpro ﬁt organization dedi- cated to advancing the science of probiotics, prebiotics, andrelated substances.ISAPP is funded by membership dues fromcompanies and nonpro ﬁt organizations that share ISAPP ’s mission, but ISAPP activities are determined by an all-volunteer,academic voting board of directors.
ISAPP provides travelfunding for experts to attend annual meetings and participate in small groups to discuss compelling topics in the ﬁeld. These groups are composed of invited academic experts and scientistsfrom member companies.The discussion group participantsinclude this article ’s authors and others listed in the acknowl- edgment section.The group undertook a nonsystematicapproach to review available evidence for any probiotics (allstrains and strain combinations) as an initial step to informwhether and which probiotic/outcome combinations were suchthat they could be nominated to the USPSTF as worthwhilecandidates to undergo their more stringent and systematic re-view process.Experts chose speci ﬁc endpoints to assess and each expert collated evidence as he/she deemed appropriate.Concluding evidence statements were considered for probioticsas a category, although strain designations for all included pro-biotics were provided.
Our goal was to focus on a few endpoints where probiotics have been assessed for prevention. We largely relied on sys-tematic reviews conducted by other groups.We focused on evi-dence that any probiotic preparation could prevent urinary tractinfections (UTIs), prevent vaginal tract infections, prevent GItract infections, prevent respiratory tract infections (RTIs),improve risk factors associated with cardiovascular health, or reduce antibiotic use.We made a preliminary judgment that these endpoints were the most likely to provide adequately robust information to leadto a general conclusion about the usefulness of certain probioticsfor prevention.Although probiotics have been studied in healthyor at-risk populations for other endpoints including dentalhealth, mental health, and prevention of allergy, we did notconsider it likely that evidence was suf ﬁcient in these more nascent ﬁelds of investigation to warrant their consideration herein.
Description of evidence for speci ﬁc indications Prevention of urinary tract infections in females Symptomatic, culture-positive UTIs are the most common bacterial infection in the world, accounting for ~25% of all in-fections in females [ 23]. Over 500,000 females in Canada require antibiotic treatment for UTIs by the age of 24 [ 45].To treat recurrent infections, low-dose antibiotics are often pre-scribed for 12 mo to kill pathogens entering the bladder andstopping the cycle of infections [ 46].Other options include self-administered short courses of antibiotics upon symptomdevelopment, daily or twice daily vaginal rinses withD.J.Merenstein et al.Advances in Nutrition 15 (2024) 100265 2 TABLE 1 Details of reviewed studies.Reference Study design Population studied Sample size (test, I andplacebo, P)Outcomes examined Method of probiotic deliveryStrain(s) and dose (CFU/ d 1)Control Results a.Individual trial reports UTI Reid et al.

The rationale for probiotic lactobacilli to prevent UTIs is that they inhibit the uropathogens that ascend from the rectum to the perineum, vagina, and urethra into the bladder.In females who have never experienced a UTI, these anatomical areas are typi-cally colonized predominantly by lactobacilli [ 49].Thus, boosting the abundance of lactobacilli in females where theseorganisms are depleted or not suf ﬁciently protective against uropathogens is a potential means to prevent infection.
Strains ofpotential interest to reduce risk of infection in otherwise healthyfemales have been tested in preclinical studies for characteristicsincluding immunomodulatory properties and uropathogen in-hibition, and production of antimicrobial substances such ashydrogen peroxide [ 50,51]. The modes of administration that have been tested for pro- biotics to prevent UTIs are either oral or direct installation intothe vagina and around the perineum.Oral administration hasbeen shown to result in the probiotic reaching the urogenital site,albeit in low numbers [ 52].An advantage of the oral approach is that products can be developed as dietary or nutritional sup-plements and they can potentially inhibit ascension of the uro-pathogens from the intestine.The intravaginal applicationencompasses a drug or cosmetic regulatory pathway, which en-tails higher costs for development, but this approach results inhigher counts of the probiotic to the site.
The literature on probiotics to support urogenital health in females comprises only a few trials via either the oral orvaginal routes. The strongest ef ﬁcacy data as measured by systematic review and meta-analyses comes from studies inadults; insuf ﬁcient evidence exists for any strains in children [23,24,53].In a randomized, double-blind trial, weekly vaginal applica- tion for 12 mo of suppositories containing 10 9Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus GR-1 with 109Limosilactobacillus fermentum B-54 lowered the UTI recurrence rate in 17 subjects compared withthe previous 12 mo from 6 to 1.2 per annum; 21 females treated with a prebiotic delivered in skim milk had a similar result [ 7].In a randomized, placebo-controlled study of young females with ahistory of recurrent UTI, antimicrobials were administered foracute UTI and then subjects were randomly assigned to receiveeither Lactobacillus crispatus CTV-05 or placebo daily for 5 d, then once weekly for 10 wk.
The recurrent UTI episodes were reducedby the probiotic compared with placebo (7 of 48 compared with13 of 48) [relative risk (RR), 0.5; 95% con ﬁdence interval (CI): 0.2, 1.2] [ 8]. In another study, 47 females with a history of 3 or more UTI episodes in the previous 12 mo were randomlyassigned to receive 2.8 g vaginal suppositories containing either 7.5 x 10 8L.rhamnosus or placebo [solid semisynthetic glycerides (97.3%) and colloidal silica (2.7%)] twice weekly for 26 wk [ 9].The resultant UTI rate at 6 mo did not differ between the groups(1.41) (95% CI: 0.88, 1.98).Three studies examined the potential use of the probiotic, L.rhamnosus GG, for urogenital health.In one open-label trial, 42 postmenopausal healthy females consumed yogurt containing1–2/C210 9CFU/d of the strain for 1 mo.
The probiotic was recovered in the vaginas of only 4 females (9.5%) despite beingpresent in the stool of 33 females (78.6%) [ 10].In another study, 10 healthy females vaginally inserted a capsule containing either L. rhamnosus GR-1 plus Limosilactoba- cillus reuteri RC-14 or L.rhamnosus GG for 3 consecutive nights.Vaginal swabs were taken before and at various time points afterprobiotic use.Strains GR-1 and/or RC-14 persisted in the vaginafor/C2019 d, whereas L.rhamnosus GG was detectable /C205d[ 11].One open randomized controlled trial of L.rhamnosus GG on UTI prevention was conducted in 50 females consuming a beveragecontaining 4 /C210 10L.rhamnosus GG/100 mL 5 d/wk for 1 y.No reduction in UTI incidence was observed (43% compared with30% with placebo) [ 12].At 6 mo, 19 (39%) subjects in the L.rhamnosus GG group, and 18 (36%) in the control had suffered /C211 recurrence.Taken together, these results suggest that GG is not effective at preventing UTIs.
With oral administration, a combination of L. rhamnosus GR-1 andL.reuteri RC-14 has been shown to reduce the recurrence of UTI compared with the common antibiotic treatment, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment.Beerepoot et al.[ 13] conducted a double-blind, randomized noninferiority trial of252 postmenopausal females with recurrent UTIs.Subjectswere randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: 480 g oftrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus 1 placebo capsule twicedaily or 1 capsule containing /C2110 9CFU each of L.rhamnosus GR-1 and L.reuteri RC-14 twice daily.Over the 12-mo study, the UTI rate for the probiotic group was reduced comparedwith baseline from 6.8 to 3.3 per year, whereas the antibiotictreatment reduced UTIs from 7.0 to 2.9 per year.Thebetween-treatment difference of 0.4 UTIs per year (95% CI: /C00.4, 1.5) was outside the noninferiority margin of 10%, indi- cating equivalency of the interventions [ 13].
The subjects pro- vided samples of urine, feces, and a vaginal swab before thestudy medication was given, and each month until 3 mo afterdiscontinuation of the medication. Drug-resistant Escherichia coli was isolated from 80% to 95% of subjects in the placebo groupafter 1 mo of antibiotic use.In contrast, the level in the probioticgroup was unchanged at around 20% [ 54], providing an addi- tional rationale for the use of probiotics instead of antibiotics inthis scenario.Prevention of vaginal tract infections Infections of the vaginal tract are extremely common, caused by bacteria, yeast, and viruses.Particular concern arises withrespect to reproduction, where the ability to conceive and take afetus to term is adversely affected by a microbiota disrupted bypathogens [ 55,56].Vaginal tract infections are characterized by a disruption of the normal microbiota.
The vaginal microbiota of healthy females primarily contains species under the umbrella of “lactobacilli, ”although this is not universally the case. About 25% of healthy females have a microbiota that is not dominatedby lactobacilli microbiota but instead by facultative and obligateanaerobes [ 57,58].Bacterial vaginosis (BV) results from an imbalance of bacteria that normally reside in the vagina, allowing pathogenic oropportunistic pathogenic bacteria, typically Gram-negative mi-crobes such as Gardnerella vaginalis , to overgrow.Symptoms include discharge, vaginal ﬂuid pH >4.5, ﬁshy odor, and discomfort.There are both microbiological and symptomatic components to diagnosing BV, but vaginal dysbiosis can be asymptomatic [ 59,60].Vaginal yeast infections (also called vulvovaginal candidiasis because the fungus Candida albicans is aD.J.Merenstein et al.
Advances in Nutrition 15 (2024) 100265 10 causative agent) are also common, causing local irritation, vaginal discharge, and itchiness. Probiotics have been investi-gated for their effectiveness to prevent both BV and vaginal yeastinfections.The rationale for using probiotics to prevent these conditions is based on promoting a microbiota that resists the overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens.Probiotics have been administered with the goal of replenishing the vaginal microbiota with lac-tobacilli able to inhibit the growth of the pathogens, interferewith pathogen adherence and bio ﬁlm formation on the epithe- lium, and promote the return of the host ’s naturally occurring lactobacilli strains.Probiotics have been administered bothorally and intravaginally in studies investigating ef ﬁcacy.The latter has the advantage of delivering higher numbers of pro-biotic directly to the vaginal tract, which may improve ef ﬁcacy.Studies conducted with probiotics to prevent BV are limited.
Preclinical human studies documented the ability of orally administered probiotic strains to reach the vaginal tract [ 15,52]. Clinical outcomes were measured in a randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled study in females with a history of /C212B V episodes in the previous year.Subjects were asked to report theiroccurrences of BV and if reporting symptoms of malodor or thindischarge, the diagnosis was con ﬁrmed by Amsel criteria at a clinic.The intervention in this study was intravaginal adminis-tration of a capsule containing 8 x 10 9CFU of L.rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (strains not reported) [ 14].The subjects were randomly assigned to use 1 capsule/d of the probiotic ( n¼58 females) or placebo ( n¼62 females) for 7 d, followed by cessation of product for 7 d, and then restarted usage for 7 d.The females returned at 30 and 60d after the second 7-day treatment to assess the vaginal micro-biology.
At a further 10 mo telephone follow-up, subjects wereasked to report BV symptoms, diagnosis of BV or G. vaginalis , and adverse events over a 2 –11-mo period.The study reported that the probiotic intervention resulted in lower recurrence rates ofBV [15.8% (9 of 57 females) compared with 45.0% (27 of 60females); P<0.001] and G.vaginalis incidence through 2 mo [3.5% (2 of 57 females) compared with 18.3% (11 of 60 fe-males); P¼0.02].A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in females presenting with con ﬁrmed BV and also with a history of recurrent BV ( /C212 documented episodes of BV in the previous year) [ 17].All subjects were treated with metronidazole for 7 d before randomization.The study inter-vention was capsules of L.crispatus IP 174178 10 9CFU admin- istered vaginally for 14 –28 d over 112 d total.The primary endpoint was the prevention of bacteriologically con ﬁrmed and clinically diagnosed recurrence of BV at day 112.
Other clinicallyrelevant secondary endpoints were also tracked. A full analysisset of subjects ( n¼98) included randomized subjects compliant with/C211 treatment capsule; per-protocol subjects numbered 85.In both the full analysis set and per-protocol groups, probioticsreduced recurrence at day 112 by approximately half.Specif-ically, in the per protocol group, 16 of the 37 patients (43.2%) inthe placebo group presented with /C211 recurrence of BV (90% CI: 29.8, 56.6) compared with 8 of the 39 patients (20.5%) in theprobiotic group (90% CI: 9.9, 31.1; P¼0.033).Larsson et al.[ 16] conducted a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in females with clinically diagnosed BV.Although the primary endpoint of this study was therapeutic,and therefore out of scope for this article, the secondary endpoint addressed increased time to relapse after clinical cure.
Thetherapeutic stage of this trial enrolled 100 females, and 76 ofthem who were cured of BV with clindamycin were carriedforward to the next phase. The study duration was 6 menstrualcycles or until relapse during that time.The probiotic tested was intravaginally inserted capsules of L.gasseri Lba EB01-DSM 14869 combined with L.rhamnosus Lbp PB01-DSM 14870, with each strain present at a dose of /C2110 8–9CFU/capsule, 1 capsule/d.No impact on the initial cure rate was observed, but atthe end of the study, the probiotic group had 64.9% BV-freesubjects compared with the placebo group with 46.2%.Furthermore, the probiotic group had a greater time from cure torelapse than the placebo group ( P¼0.027).In conclusion, we considered studies that enrolled either healthy females or females with active cases of BV but werefollowed after cure for remission rates.Taken together, they total 4 RCTs.
All studies investigated different probiotic preparations, with some studies using oral administration and others usingintravaginal administration. All showed that the probioticadministered delayed recurrence.The involvement of dysbioticmicrobiota in the etiology of BV allows a hypothetical mecha-nism between the live probiotic microbe and ef ﬁcacy in pro- moting vaginal health.However, the data are limited.Prevention of GI tract infections Prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.Much clinical research has focused on the use of probiotics to preventantibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD).Although antibiotics areused in unhealthy patient populations, they are also used pro-phylactically in a variety of situations, often to treat ambulatoryconditions.Furthermore, probiotic use with antibiotics could intheory help sustain normal gut microbiota composition andfunction, in generally healthy people.
Therefore, although thescope of this review is prevention in healthy populations, we opted to include data on probiotic use for AAD. AAD refers to diarrhea that emerges during or shortly after antibiotic use, withno other apparent cause [ 61].Essentially, any antibiotic has the potential to induce AAD, which might appear hours after theinitial dose or even several months after stopping the treatment.The likelihood of AAD depends on several factors, including itsspeciﬁcd eﬁnition, the type of antibiotic prescribed, and patient factors.Particularly vulnerable are children younger than 6 mo,adults over 65 y, and hospitalized individuals [ 62].In a recent systematic review of RCTs studying the impact of probioticsduring antibiotic therapy, AAD was observed in 19% of pediatric control group participants, with reported rates varying from a low 2% to as high as 80% [ 32].Among adults ( /C2165 y old), AAD occurrence ranges between 10% and 37% [ 62].
The symptoms of AAD can differ in severity, ranging from mild diarrhea to con-ditions such as colitis or pseudomembranous colitis [ 62]. Although Clostridioides dif ﬁcile(previously Clostridium dif ﬁcile)i s the predominant infectious cause, especially in more severeAAD, other pathogens such as Staphylococcus, Candida, Entero- bacteriaceae, andKlebsiella may be also involved [ 63].Numerous systematic reviews, including a 2019 Cochrane review in children, found that most studied probiotics can reduce AAD risk [ 32].A meta-analysis published in 2021, including 42 studies for a total of 11,305 subjects, reported thatco-administration of probiotics with antibiotics reduces risk ofD.J.Merenstein et al.Advances in Nutrition 15 (2024) 100265 11 AAD in adults by 37% [risk ratio (RR) ¼0.63 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.73), P<0.001] [ 33].Using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) criteria, theoverall quality of the evidence was found to be moderate.
Designlimitations of many of the included RCTs were balanced by agood magnitude of effect and dose –response gradient, thus increasing the certainty of the body of evidence. A meta-analysis of 8 RCTs in 4691 elderly subjects reported a reduction in the incidence of AAD [ 34].Although the authors recommend that elderly individuals be routinely distributedprobiotics within 48 h of the ﬁrst dose of antibiotics to prevent AAD development, this derives from only 5 RCTs.Morelarge-scale RCT studies for the elderly are needed to con ﬁrm the preventive effects of probiotics in this age group.Single-strain meta-analyses of RCTs found that compared with placebo or no intervention, probiotics such as Saccharo- myces boulardii (the most commonly used strain investigated is CNCM I-745) or L.rhamnosus GG were most effective [ 32,35,36].Given these ﬁndings, in 2023, the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) rec-ommended L.rhamnosus GG or S.
boulardii for preventing AAD. For cases of C.dif ﬁcile-related AAD, ESPGHAN conditionally recommended S.boulardii [64].The World Gastroenterology Organization (WGO), for children, also recommends S.boulardii orL.rhamnosus GG.In addition, WGO recommends multispecies probiotic comprising Biﬁdobacterium bi ﬁdum W23, Biﬁdobacte- rium animalis subsp.lactis W51, L.acidophilus W37, L acidophilus W55, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei W20, Lactiplantibacillus planta- rumW62, L.rhamnosus W71, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius W24; orL.rhamnosus (strains E/N, Oxy, and Pen).For adults, WGO offers a long list of probiotic options including yogurt with spe-ciﬁc strains or multispecies probiotics.Unlike ESPGHAN, WGO bases its recommendations on just 1 RCT [ 2].Meanwhile, in 2020, the American Gastroentereological Association chose notto review evidence for AAD prevention using probiotics [ 65 ].Yet, they did suggest speci ﬁc probiotics to reduce risk of C.
dif ﬁcileinfections in antibiotic-treated children and adults. In conclusion, the data for a moderate protective effect of probiotics in the prevention of AAD are overall supportive.A speciﬁc recommendation for the use of probiotics, in particular for vulnerable age groups, might be actively developed based onfuture well-designed studies on optimal timing, dose, and dura-tion of probiotics more systematically associated with a pre-scription of antibiotics.Research to utilize probiotic strainsmechanistically suited to be effective against AAD could improvethe success of future human trials.Prevention of travelers ’diarrhea.Travelers ’diarrhea (TD) is a common health concern for travelers.Although it can occuranywhere, risk is higher when traveling from developed to less-developed regions of the world [ 66].A systematic review of RCTs from 2019 found that only 3 probiotics ( S.boulardii, L.rhamnosus GG, and unspeci ﬁed strains of L.acidophilus ) were studied for preventing TD [ 37].
Among these, only S. boulardii demonstrated signi ﬁcant ef ﬁcacy.Another systematic review of RCTs, with network meta-analysis, examined the comparativeeffectiveness of probiotics and rifaximin in the prevention ofTD [ 67].Both probiotics (RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.95) and rifaximin (RR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.63) were associatedwith a signi ﬁcantly lower incidence of TD when compared with placebo, with rifaximin superior to probiotics in loweringTD incidence.The data supporting the use of probiotics for either prevention or treatment of TD were not suf ﬁcient to make a graded recommendation.Prevention of community-acquired diarrhea.Children attending daycare centers face an increased risk of infections of the GItract.Preventing these infections not only bene ﬁts the children and their families but also society.To address this, several pro- biotics have been studied for their potential in preventingcommunity-acquired diarrhea.
For instance, a study in Finlandinvolving 571 children aged 1 –6 y in daycare centers found no reduction in diarrhea but did report fewer absences due to GI andrespiratory infections [ 21]. In addition, there was a reduced likelihood of antibiotics being prescribed for RTIs.However, theefﬁcacy of L.rhamnosus GG is not universally supported.A ran- domized, double-blind controlled study by Hojsak et al.[ 22] found no signi ﬁcant differences in the occurrence or duration of GI infections among 281 Croatian children aged 13 –86 mo who were administered L.rhamnosus in fermented milk.The use of probiotic strains tested to date for preventing various types of GI illnesses, including AAD and community-acquired diarrhea, has shown mixed results.Although somestrains such as L.rhamnosus GG and S.boulardii appear prom- ising, especially for AAD, the evidence is not consistently strongacross all conditions.
Future studies should focus on establishingoptimum dosages, durations, and strains to achieve the bestclinical outcomes. Prevention of RTIs RTIs are a major worldwide public health threat.Illnesses resulting from RTI reduce the quality of life and productivity.They are a frequent reason for seeking outpatient medical careand for hospital admissions, and cause >2 million deaths annu- ally [ 68–71].Low-cost, effective strategies for RTI prevention in healthy populations could, therefore, have widespread bene ﬁts at both the individual and population levels.Mechanisms by which probiotics may prevent RTI are multifaceted.Plausible mechanisms include stimulating variouscomponents of both innate and adaptive immunity, strength-ening epithelial barriers, producing antipathogenic compoundsand directly interacting or competing with pathogens.
Thesepotential mechanisms are in some instances strain-speci ﬁc but can also be shared across microorganisms of larger taxonomicgroups such as genera or species, or even among categories suchas Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria [ 1,72,73]. This suggests that probiotic interventions could plausibly impact RTIrisk through shared mechanisms, but strain-speci ﬁc and possibly pathogen-speci ﬁc effects are also likely.Therefore, when eval- uating whether suf ﬁcient evidence exists to support recom- mending probiotic interventions for RTI prevention in healthypopulations, high-quality systematic reviews, and meta-analysesthat group all probiotics into a single class of intervention or thatconsider genus-, species-, strain- or disease-speci ﬁc effects can all inform our understanding of the evidence [ 72].Evidence regarding the use of probiotics for RTI prevention is largely derived from clinical studies published within the past 2decades reporting orally ingested interventions.
Collectively,those studies have included thousands of generally healthy child and adult participants while testing various probiotic in- terventions, primarily using strains within the genera Biﬁdo- bacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactocaseibacillus, Limosilactobacillus,D.J. Merenstein et al.Advances in Nutrition 15 (2024) 100265 12 and Lactoplantibacillus.Recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials within that evidence base are largely consistentin reporting that probiotic interventions reduce risk of experi-encing 1 or more RTIs, reduce the incidence rate of RTI, andreduce the total number of days with RTI [ 25–31].Though effect sizes vary across meta-analyses, reductions in the RR of experi- encing 1 or more RTIs ranged from 9% to 24% with 95% CIs spanning a negligible 2% to an appreciable 37% risk reduction[25,26,30,31].
Reported reductions in the rate ratio of illness episodes and total days of illness are larger and range from 18%to 31% with 95% CIs spanning an 8% to 46% rate reduction[26–30]. Despite meta-analyses consistently reporting favorable effects of probiotics for RTI prevention, the studies demonstratedconsiderable heterogeneity in results across individual trials.That heterogeneity either could not be fully explored due toinsufﬁcient data or, when explored, was generally not explained by subgroup analyses based on factors such as study quality, population age, type of RTI or composition, dose or duration ofintervention, among others.An additional reason for unex-plained heterogeneity may be strain speci ﬁcity [ 1].
However, few meta-analyses have empirically examined this possibility.That is likely due, in part, to the fact that relatively few indi-vidual strains or strain combinations have been tested in enoughstudies within a target population or against the same outcometo conduct a meaningful meta-analysis. Those that have do notshow a clear bene ﬁt for RTI prevention [ 31,74].Additionally, concerns regarding risk of bias, including publication bias, have also been reported [ 26,30].As a result, meta-analyses imple- menting the GRADE scoring system have considered the evi-dence supporting probiotic interventions for RTI prevention tobe low quality [ 27,30,31].Reduction of antibiotic use There is considerable worldwide interest in reducing anti- biotic use due to the growing global burden of antibiotic resis- tance [ 75].The importance of this issue to public health led us to decide that this topic was in scope for this review.
Notably, an-tibiotics are often prescribed unnecessarily, particularly for RTIand other common infectious diseases [ 76,77]. Healthcare visits in outpatient settings comprise the primary setting where mostantibiotics are prescribed [ 78].Implementing interventions that prevent or reduce the incidence, duration, or severity of commoninfections (of any etiology) may therefore reduce antibiotic usein generally healthy populations.For example, separatemodeling studies have estimated that probiotic supplementation could prevent millions of antibiotic prescriptions annually based solely on the estimated potential bene ﬁts of probiotics for RTI prevention [ 79–81].Several trials testing the effectiveness of various probiotic interventions for preventing common infections such as RTIs orGI infections have assessed and reported antibiotic use as a pri-mary or secondary outcome.
A 2018 meta-analysis of RCTs thatincluded 17 of those trials reported that infants and childrengiven probiotics to prevent common infections had a 29% (95%CI: 0.54, 0.94) lower RR of being prescribed antibiotics [ 38]. Heterogeneity was low after a single study was removed and the effect size was increased when only 5 trials considered to have a low risk of bias were included [RR ¼0.46 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.97)] [38].Other meta-analyses of RCTs have also reported thatinfants and children given probiotics to prevent RTI had a lower RR of being prescribed antibiotics, with effect sizes ranging froma 31% to 41% risk reduction and 95% CIs spanning a 5% –59% reduction in risk [ 30,31,39].The overall quality of that evidence has been rated as low or moderate using GRADE scoring, with substantial heterogeneity and/or unclear risk of bias cited as reasons for uncertainty [ 30,31,38,39].Notably, all trials included in those meta-analyses were conducted in infants andchildren.
Two double-blind, randomized controlled studiesconducted in adults that were not included in the meta-analysesfailed to show that the probiotic interventions tested reducedantibiotic use [ 18,19]. Speci ﬁcally, the combination of L.plantarum HEAL9 and L.paracasei 8700:2 when consumed daily for 1 y reduced the incidence of common colds but did notreduce antibiotic use (secondary outcome) relative to placebo inhealthy adults with a history of frequent colds [ 18].Likewise, consuming a combination of L.rhamnosus GG and B.lactis BB-12 (1.3 –1.6/C210 10cells/d) for /C201 y did not reduce antibiotic administration (primary outcome) relative to placebo in carehome residents aged > 65 y [ 19].Taken together, there does not appear to be strong evidence to support probiotic interventions for reducing antibiotic use inhealthy adults at this time.In contrast, results from studiesconducted in infants and children are promising.
However,interpreting those results is challenging as antibiotic use has notbeen measured as a primary outcome. In addition, if any effectsof probiotic interventions on risk or duration of infectious dis-ease are strain-speci ﬁc, impacts on antibiotic use may also be strain-speci ﬁc.However, too few studies using the same inter- vention have been included in available meta-analyses toconduct a meaningful strain-speci ﬁc analysis, and in 1 meta- analysis of 3 studies using L.rhamnosus GG, antibiotic use was not reduced [ 31].Additional high-quality RCTs of probiotic intervention that de ﬁne antibiotic use as a primary outcome, ideally, or as a secondary outcome are needed to help supportfuture recommendations.Maintain cardiovascular health or prevent CVD CVD is a formidable global health challenge, claiming more lives than any other cause [ 82].
Maintaining cardiovascular health and preventing CVD is multifaceted, and the disease cor-relates with several lifestyle factors including diet, smoking, useof antibiotics, and early-life events such as mode of delivery, aswell as risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, andlipid disorders [ 83–87]. Several of those factors have a link to the gut microbiome and recent research has delved into the intricate relationship between the gut microbiome and cardiometabolic health [ 88].The progression of cardiometabolic and CVDs, from a healthy state into a clinically silent CVD (including metabolicsyndrome and insulin resistance) and ﬁnally into a clinically overt CVD highlights its strong connection to early alterations inthe gut microbiota, including a reduction in microbiome rich-ness, a decline in butyrate-producing bacteria, and an increase inpathobionts [ 89].
In line with the strong correlation between the above mentioned lifestyle factors, most of the efforts to prevent CVDare focused on dietary interventions, reduction of smoking, and medications to reduce blood pressure and improve blood lipids. However, the correlation between CVD and the microbiotacomposition and activity also increases the interest to explore theD.J.Merenstein et al.Advances in Nutrition 15 (2024) 100265 13 potential of probiotics, as well as fermented foods, in preventing or managing CVD.Due to the slow progression of CVD, nostudies have been designed to explore the ability of probiotics toprevent disease, but some studies have evaluated probiotics inthe reduction of risk factors such as hypertension, glucosemetabolism, and obesity, among others [ 90–92].Two systematic reviews of RCTs have evaluated the effects of probiotics on metabolic syndrome.
Although the inclusioncriteria differed substantially, both suggest that probiotics mayhave a favorable, albeit marginal impact on metabolic syndromecomponents. The ﬁrst review included 18 studies with a range of outcome measurements.Both the study protocols and describedoutcomes showed substantial heterogeneity, and signi ﬁcant differences between the intervention and control groups wereonly reported for body fat percentage (standard mean difference:–0.30%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( –0.16 mg/dL) [40].The second review included 9 studies, also having sub- stantial heterogeneity.Favorable effects on body mass index (variation from no difference to /C01.0 kg/m 2in probiotics compared with control) and glucose metabolism (variation fromno change to –7.5 mg/dL) were described, but despite those positive effects, the included studies were rated as nonrelevantfor CVD prevention [ 83].
However, the authors also conclude that the effects probably are dose and strain-speci ﬁc and that the duration of intervention may have been too short. A thirdsystematic review with meta-analysis adopted a broad approachand investigated the impact of a range of probiotics on 15variables related to obesity, diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [ 41].Inclusion criteria were met by 105 articles covering a total of 6826 subjects.The authors conclude that theprobiotic strains tested resulted in minor but consistent im-provements in several metabolic risk factors in subjects withmetabolic diseases.However, a high number of studies wereconducted in only 1 country (Iran); when these were excluded,the sensitivity analysis revealed nonsigni ﬁcant effect estimates for all parameters.
Although our scope focuses on probiotics, in the context of CVD, it is of interest to note that 2 reviews looked into the impactof complementary synbiotics (a combination of probiotics and prebiotics) on various markers of metabolic syndrome. A meta- analysis of 5 RCTs showed that the studied synbiotics signi ﬁ- cantly reduced serum insulin levels, triglycerides, total choles-terol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, waist circumference,body weight, systolic blood pressure, and serum IL-6 concen-trations, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterollevels compared with placebo [ 42].These results were both statistically signi ﬁcant and clinically relevant.Overall, the risk of bias and heterogeneity was low, but the small number of studiesas well as the low sample size requires con ﬁrmation of the evi- dence from larger trials.
Another analysis, based on ten eligible publications (9 RCTs, 344 participants) concluded that supple- mentation with probiotics or synbiotics compared with placeboreduced total cholesterol in adults with metabolic syndrome, butwithout affecting weight, body mass index, waist circumference,fasting blood sugar, homeostasis model assessment for insulinresistance, insulin, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein choles-terol, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( P>0.05) [ 43]. Most studies suffered from methodological limitations, differ-ences in strains, dosage and duration of the interventions, andpatient characteristics, which underlines again the need for more well-designed trials.A recent randomized placebo-controlled trial using a mix of 2 strains of lactobacilli and 1 bi ﬁdobacteria on adults with meta- bolic syndrome indicated that the effect of the probiotic sup-plementation depended on the diet.
A subset of the probiotic arm responded with improvements in triglycerides and diastolic blood pressure ( P<0.05) and those responders both had a distinct microbiome pro ﬁle and higher intake of certain nutri- ents like sugars, calcium, zinc, and folate. This suggests thatprobiotics could be combined with a healthy diet to increase theefﬁcacy and potentially reduce CVD risk [ 20].Discussion Our aim of this article was to provide a descriptive evaluation of evidence that probiotics can prevent disease or maintainhealth, or in other words, an assessment of the value of probioticsfor healthy people.Our conclusions for the endpoints discussedare that none of the ef ﬁcacy data are yet suf ﬁciently robust to meet the stringent criteria imposed by the USPSTF for a pre- ventive recommendation.
It is important to understand, howev-er, that the conclusion that the data are not ready for apopulation-based USPSTF recommendation is not the same assaying the data are not suf ﬁcient to be considered for healthy people. Probiotic research is relatively new, and the absence ofevidence of effectiveness is not the same as having evidence ofineffectiveness.In fact, we know that there are many speci ﬁc circumstances where, considering available ef ﬁcacy and safety evidence, probiotics are a prudent option.But the evidence is notyet suf ﬁciently robust for recommendations for prevention in the general population.We reviewed 6 prevention endpoints: UTIs and vaginal in- fections in women, RTI, GI conditions, CVD, and antibiotic use.For UTIs, we concluded that speci ﬁc probiotic strains (L.rhamnosus GR-1 and L.reuteri RC-14) administered orally may help prevent UTIs in women, although the evidence for vaginallyadministered strains is lacking.
We judged that the existing ev-idence would not be enough to request a USPSTF review. Theevidence base for AAD and community-acquired diarrhea wasthe most robust of any outcome we examined and was supportedby some independent guidelines.However, because of study heterogeneity and in some cases failure to identify the probiotic strains studied, the evidence is likely not suf ﬁcient for a recommendation by USPSTF.As was the case with other out-comes we evaluated, the biological plausibility was strong forprobiotic prevention of RTIs and to decrease antibiotic usage.However, the evidence likely was still not robust enough for arecommendation if we apply USPSTF standards.With managingrisk factors of CVD, probiotics likely have great promise and weare hopeful that future research will advance our understandingof the potential of biotics to contribute to cardiometabolichealth.
However, due to the complex, multifactorial causes of CVD and the limited number of studies, the data for a recom- mendation to use probiotic interventions to prevent CVD need tobe further strengthened. As such, a parallel can be made with theUSPSTF ’s updated evidence review on the use of vitamin sup- plementation to prevent CVD and cancer, resulting overall in aD/I grade [ 93].D.J.Merenstein et al.Advances in Nutrition 15 (2024) 100265 14 As mentioned, the bar for USPSTF needs to be extremely high for several reasons, most importantly because the recommen-dations are for healthy people.In this context, it is important torecognize that evidence for the safety of probiotics in the generalpopulation is strong [ 4].In speci ﬁc situations, such as preventing AAD in subjects receiving antibiotics, certain probiotics may be considered.
If a patient is having recurrent UTIs or frequent RTIs, an evidence-based approach would entail talking with the pa-tient about the evidence behind the strains we reviewed. Inaddition, any intervention needs to be weighed against its riskand costs.Many of the strains discussed herein have a strongrecord of safety and are relatively inexpensive.Further, aggre-gate data –which is considered here –may vary in its applica- bility to any individual.A healthy person may reasonably decidewhen considering his own need and individual response thatprobiotic use is warranted.
Although a current USPSTF analysis would probably result in an I grade for the use of probiotics in the prevention outcomes we assessed, it might only take a few well-designed studies toovercome the evidence gap, as illustrated by the cluster ofconsistent elements pointing to bene ﬁcial probiotic effects in prevention or risk reduction, and also supported by the currentlyavailable guidance issued by several specialized scienti ﬁc soci- eties and health organizations. The most convincing evidence for the bene ﬁts of probiotics in disease prevention or risk reduction for a speci ﬁc target popu- lation would come from 2 or more RCTs.These RCTs should bedesigned, conducted, and reported to minimize bias, involving well-characterized probiotics, appropriate dosages, and clearly deﬁned outcomes.The evidence should be robust and precise enough to convincingly and directly demonstrate risk reductionsfor prespeci ﬁed outcomes.
Results should be generalizable to the target populations of interest [ 94]. In addition, the studies would characterize and report adverse effects, to permit a carefulassessment of safety concerns.When ﬂaws in study design, conduct, and reporting are present, they necessitate that study results show higher probiotic bene ﬁt magnitudes to enable con ﬁdence that even when accounting for those ﬂaws and the resulting potential mis-estimation of probiotic beneﬁts and harms, one can be reasonably certain that the pro- biotic provides a net bene ﬁt in disease prevention or risk reduction outcomes for the target population and that those bene ﬁts convincingly outweigh potential safety concerns.
Similarly, incases where only a single study is available, one would expect thatstudy to be of high quality and convincing and that there be astrong subject matter context for understanding how the inter-vention achieves its bene ﬁcial effects, to overcome potential generalizability concerns that arise from having to rely on only asingle study that has not (yet) been corroborated. The original aim of our discussion group was to assess evi- dence for the family of biotic substances (probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics) and fermented foods to prevent dis-ease in healthy people [ 95–98].However, we focused on pro- biotics for this article in part because the evidence for probioticswas stronger than for the other substances and also for practicalpurposes to narrow the scope.The evidence base for other biotic substances is expanding.
For example, some postbiotics, de ﬁned as preparations of inan- imate microorganisms and/or their components –with or without metabolic endproducts –that confer a health bene ﬁt,could potentially have a more potent impact on health parame- ters than the live microbe from which they were derived, asshown for a postbiotic preparation of a strain of Akkermansia muciniphila . In an exploratory study involving overweight and obese human volunteers, pasteurized A.muciniphila , though not live, demonstrated a favorable effect on several risk factors for CVD, including improved insulin sensitivity and reduced cholesterol.Although this study was exploratory, it hints at thepotential of using speci ﬁc postbiotic products to reduce the risk of CVD [ 99 ].Furthermore, fermented food consumption, which may introduce a large number of live bacteria, dead bacteria, andbacterial components to the diet, has been associated with pos-itive health outcomes.
In a cohort study on >46,000 adults, using information from The National Health and Nutrition Examina-tion Survey database, it was concluded that an additional 100-gintake of microbe-containing foods was associated with lowersystolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein, plasma glucose, plasma insulin, triglyceride, waist circumference and BMI (kg/m 2) levels, and a higher level of HDL cholesterols [ 100]. A similar effect was seen in a meta-analysis of cohort studies on theeffect of yogurt consumption on the incident risk of CVD [ 101].Those studies underscore the potential advantages of incorpo-rating fermented foods into the diet for mitigating the progres-sion of CVD.We recognize that probiotics have been studied for endpoints on healthy subjects that we did not include.For example, pre-vention of allergy, cognitive function, mood, and prevention ofdental caries have all been addressed in clinical trials.
However, we judged that the evidence base for these was unlikely to be sufﬁcient to meet the high bar required for a USPSTF recom- mendation. Therefore, we did not include these endpoints in ourassessment.Our review did not consider the evidence for speci ﬁc healthy subpopulations, such as athletes, pregnant women,healthy children, and the elderly [ 102].We also did not consider probiotic use for the treatment of colic in infants, a generallyhealthy population.An individual patient data meta-analysis ofdouble-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trials of highquality concluded that L.reuteri DSM17938 is effective in reducing crying time for breastfed infants with colic [ 103].However, data for formula-fed infants with colic were lacking.
The USPSTF only has 5 recommended preventive medications –aspirin and statins to prevent CVD, medications to prevent breast cancer in high-risk women, folic acid to prevent neuraltube defects, and ocular prophylaxis for gonococcal ophthalmiain newborns. For probiotics to make it onto this list, futureprobiotic studies would need to 1) be high quality and designed to limit risks of bias –primarily double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials, 2) include healthy people or those potentially at risk for a condition that the probiotic would bepreventing, 3) demonstrate reduced risks for adverse health outcomes, consistent with the prevention, and 4) rigorously monitor and report safety concerns.We hope this review willmotivate researchers and funding sources to develop a path forneeded research so the potential of probiotics to facilitate healthcan be realized.Acknowledgments We thank Dr.
