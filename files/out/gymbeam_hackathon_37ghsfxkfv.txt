This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to examine the relationship between tree nut and peanut consumption and risk factors for CVD inrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) (PROSPERO: CRD42022309156). MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central databases were searched up to 26 September, 2021.All RCT studies that assessed the effects of tree nut or peanut consumption of any dose on CVD risk factors were included.Review Manager software was used to conduct a random effect meta-analysis for CVD outcomes from RCTs.Forestplots were generated for each outcome, between-study heterogeneity was estimated using the I 2test statistic and funnel plots and Egger ’s test for outcomes with /C2110 strata.The quality assessment used the Health Canada Quality Appraisal Tool, and the certainty of the evidence was assessed using grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE).
A total of 153 articles describing 139studies (81 parallel design and 58 cross-over design) were included in the systematic review, with 129 studies in the meta-analysis. Themeta-analysis showed a signi ﬁcant decrease for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), TC:high- density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) following nut consumption.However, the quality of evidence was “low”for only 18 intervention studies.The certainty of the body of evidence for TC:HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol, and apoB were “moderate ”because of inconsistency, for TG were “low,”and for LDL cholesterol and TC were “very low ”because of inconsistency and the likelihood of publication bias.The ﬁndings of this review provide evidence of a combined effect of tree nuts and peanuts on a range of biomarkers to create an overall CVD risk reduction.
Keywords : nuts, peanuts, CVD, cholesterol, lipids, apo, blood pressure, meta-analysis Statements of Signi ﬁcance This is the ﬁrst systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to provide a comprehensive picture of whether all or some types of tree nuts and peanuts are preferential for improving CVD risk and if there is a dose response to the effect.

As part of a healthy diet,food-based dietary guidelines globally recommend nuts as a keycomponent, with a typical serving of 15 –30 g/d [ 3,4]. Nuts are rich in fats, making them energy-dense, and concern regardingthe impact of nuts on body weight has been reported in theliterature [ 5–8].A recent review has demonstrated that energy compensation may occur following a meal with nuts, which mitigates this concern [ 9].However, nuts are considered to be good sources of unsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E, minerals (forexample, magnesium and potassium), plant sterols, polyphenols,and dietary ﬁbers [ 10].Tree nuts are de ﬁned as dry fruits that contain a seed within the ovary wall that becomes hard atmaturity.Tree nuts include almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews,chestnuts, hazelnuts, macadamias, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios,and walnuts.
Although peanuts, also known as ground nuts, arebotanically classi ﬁed as a legume rather than a nut, they appear in cuisines in a similar way to that of tree nuts and have a similarnutrient composition. This review offers the advantage of including whole tree nuts, peanuts, and mixed nuts in dietary patterns.Habitually consuming tree nuts and peanuts has been associ- ated with cardioprotective bene ﬁts [11].The effects of nuts have been shown via improvements to lipid pro ﬁles, glucose regula- tion, and antioxidant effects [ 12–14] and their ability to mediate inﬂammation, hyperglycemia, and oxidative stress [ 15].In addi- tion, a considerable amount of evidence has been reported frommeta-analyses of prospective cohort studies that higher nut con-sumption is associated with lower CVD incidence and/or CVDmortality [ 16–21].
However, to date, only 1 meta-analysis of 61 randomized and nonrandomized controlled intervention trials has reported the effects of all tree nuts and dose response on CVD riskfactors [ 22]. Since 2015, the consumption of all nuts has remained largely under investigation within randomized controlled trials(RCTs).Most meta-analyses of RCTs have focused on only 1 typeof nut –almonds [ 23,24], cashews [ 25,26], peanuts [ 27], pista- chios [ 28], and walnuts [ 29] on key CVD risk factors (for example, blood lipids, apolipoproteins, blood pressure, and in ﬂammation).Therefore, the effect of combined tree nut and peanut consump-tion remains unclear.This review provides an opportunity toadvance the understanding of whether all or some types of tree nuts and peanuts are preferential for improving CVD risk and if there is a dose response to the effect.
Despite the known health bene ﬁts associated with tree nut and peanut consumption and the promotion of nut intakesthrough dietary guidance messages, no health claim has beenauthorized globally for a cause-and-effect relationship betweennuts and CVD. However, in 2012 the European Food SafetyAuthority panel substantiated a health claim related to 30 g/d ofwalnuts having an improvement in endothelium-dependentvasodilation [ 30].Further, in 2014, Food Standards Australia New Zealand considered the relationship between walnuts andendothelium-dependent vasodilation [ 31] not to be assessable because of the small number of studies and high risk of bias.More recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration(FDA) 2017 approved a quali ﬁed health claim for 1.5 oz (42.5 g/d) of macadamia nuts and reduced risk of coronary heartdisease (CHD) [ 32].The FDA has also approved quali ﬁed health claims for nuts (2003) [ 33] and walnuts (2004) [ 34].
However, these 2 health claims were approved based on supportive but notconclusive evidence that consuming nuts and walnuts mayreduce risk of CHD. The above-mentioned regulatory applica-tions were constructed from the available scienti ﬁc literature at the time.Since these applications were assessed, new studieshave become available.An update of the literature is warrantedto determine if the ﬁndings from the observational evidence are also demonstrated in experimental studies of nut consumptionon CVD outcomes.Therefore, we performed a systematic reviewand meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) studies to quantify the relation between nut consumption and risk of CVD.Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis are reported ac- cording to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewsand Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [ 35] and checklist (Supplemental Table 1 ).
The protocol was registered in PROS- PERO (the international prospective register of systematic re-views, registration no. CRD42022309156).Search strategy and study selection A systematic search was undertaken in MEDLINE (EBSCO), PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), and Cochrane Central databases from inception to 26 September, 2021.The search strategy useda combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings inaddition to free-text search terms related to nuts and the car-diovascular outcomes of interest (that is, blood lipids, apolipo-proteins, and blood pressure).Both MEDLINE and PubMeddatabases were searched to ensure that recent studies wereidenti ﬁed [36,37].An example of the detailed search strategy for the MEDLINE database is presented in Supplemental Table 2 .Studies were restricted to those published in the English lan-guage only.
The records identi ﬁed from the search strategy were imported to Covidence software (Covidence Systematic Review software; Veritas Health Innovation), and duplicates were removed. Re-cords were screened by title and abstract by 1 reviewer (LH), andsubsequent full-text candidate articles were assessed by 2 inde-pendent reviewers (LH and EPN).Where a study protocol wasretrieved by the search (for example, a clinicaltrials.gov listing), a search was conducted to determine if a relevant article hadbeen published from the study.Any discrepancies with full-textscreening were resolved by the research team (LH, EPN, YCP)by discussion to consensus.Reference lists of the included arti-cles were manually searched to identify additional articles.In the case that the results from 1 study were reported in multiple articles, all articles were checked (LH, EPN, YCP) toavoid duplication of study populations in the analysis or over-sight of new information on included outcomes.
Where differentinformation for included outcomes was reported across theL. Houston et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1029 –1049 1030 articles, all relevant articles were included.Where the same outcomes from a single study were reported across multiple ar-ticles, decisions relating to article inclusion were based ﬁrstly on the length of the follow-up for the outcome and then on the totalsample size, with articles including larger sample sizesprioritized.
Study eligibility criteria Studies were included if they: 1) were RCTs (parallel or cross- over); 2) assessed the effects of tree nut or peanut consumption [whole tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashew, chestnut,hazelnut, macadamia, pecan, pine nut, pistachio, or walnut),mixed nuts, peanuts, or their related products (for example, nutoils, nut powders, nut ﬂours, and new genetic varieties of nuts)] of any dose on CVD risk factors [total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein(HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), apolipoprotein B (apoB), systolic blood pressure (SBP), anddiastolic blood pressure (DBP)]; 3) with a control or comparator group (an intervention with a lower amount of nuts or a usual diet without the addition of nuts); 4) in adults or children ( >2y of age) and healthy individuals or with chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, orhypertension; 5) a study duration of /C213 wk; and 6) outcomes available as a change from baseline or at the end of the inter-vention as ﬁnal values.
Studies were excluded if they were: 1) animal studies, observational studies, nonrandomized study design, reviews,commentaries, or clinical trials without a control group; 2)i n children <2 y or acutely ill individuals; 3) targeting coconut and coconut products, as their nutrient pro ﬁles differ from the aforementioned “nuts”[38]; or 4) unable to isolate the effect of nut consumption on the health outcome. Data extraction Outcome data were extracted by the ﬁrst researcher (LH) and conﬁrmed by a second researcher (MCS).A third researcher (ES) also performed quality checking on a 10% random sample of thedata extracted for inclusion in the meta-analysis using sourcedata veri ﬁcation [ 39].
The following data were extracted from each study: study details, country, study design, type of nut, nutdose, study duration, sample size and loss to follow-up, partici-pant details [age, sex, body mass index (BMI, in kg/m 2), and health status], intervention, background diet, a method to measure health effect and method to measure food consumption, results, and quality appraisal. Mean changes in relevant outcomes were extracted where possible, and in the case that these data were not available, meanﬁnal values were retrieved as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook [ 40].Study authors were contacted for additional information if the published article did not provide suf ﬁcient information.Where a study involved >1 intervention group meeting the inclusion criteria, data for the 2 intervention groupswere combined as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook[40], with the sample size divided across the 2 groups in the case of cross-over studies to avoid a unit-of-analysis error.
In the case of the Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) study[41], which included 2 intervention arms featuring a Mediter- ranean diet supplemented with either nuts or olive oil and alow-fat control arm, data from the arm receiving theMediterranean diet with olive oil was treated as the comparator group, and included studies were required to compare the nutgroup with the olive oil group. This decision was made to ensurethat the outcomes were not confounded by differences in thebackground diet of the 2 groups.Data were converted to com-mon units, for example, mg/dL was converted to mmol/L by multiplying by 0.0259 for LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and TC and by multiplying by 0.0113 for TG.Standard deviations(SDs) were imputed from standard errors (SEs) or 95% con ﬁ- dence intervals (CIs) using formulas in the Cochrane Handbook[42].Where studies reported medians and 25th and 75th per- centiles, means and SDs were imputed using the formulasdeveloped by Wan et al.[ 43].
Where imputation was not possible (for example, where geometric means were reported orwhere a median was reported with 95% CIs), the values wereused in place of the means. Where studies did not report suf ﬁ- cient data to be included in the meta-analysis (for example, if they did not report either SDs, SEs, 95% CIs, or interquartile range), the results were reported descriptively.Data synthesis and analysis Review Manager software version 5.3 (RevMan; Copenha- gen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, the Cochrane Collaboration,2014) was used to conduct the random-effects meta-analyses todetermine the weighted mean differences (with 95% CIs) inchange or ﬁnal mean values for each measure.Forest plots were generated for each outcome.
Cross-over studies were treated inthe same way as parallel studies by comparing measurementsfrom the intervention periods with the control periods.Although this approach results in a unit-of-analysis error, it isconsidered a conservative approach [ 40] and was therefore deemed appropriate. The proportion of total variation attributable to between- study heterogeneity was estimated using the I 2test statistic [44] to provide an indication of the consistency of the results.An I2value of /C2175% was deemed to indicate a high level of incon- sistency, 50% –75% substantial inconsistency, 36% –60% mod- erate inconsistency, and 0% –35% low inconsistency; based on the recommendations by Higgins et al.[ 44]I2values were generated for each analysis.The presence of small study effects(which may be the result of publication bias) was explored viafunnel plots, which were conducted for all outcomes with /C2110 strata.
Egger ’s test was then conducted in Stata IC software version 15.1 (StataCorp LLC) to test for funnel plot asymmetry. Prespeci ﬁed subgroup analyses were conducted based on study design, nut group, and nut dose ( /C2030 g/d, 31 –60 g/d, >60 g/d, based on ~30 g typically recommended as 1 serving of nutsin dietary guidelines globally [ 3]), study duration ( <12 wk compared with /C2112 wk, aligning with the approaches used in previous meta-analyses of nut consumption [ 45–47]) and participant health status to explore differences in the magnitudeof effects between subgroups.For the studies that reported nutdose as a percentage of energy intake, we multiplied the reportedpercentage by the reported mean energy intake of the trial par-ticipants to recalculate the dosage in grams per day.Subgroup analyses were conducted where there were /C2110 effect sizes per outcome in total [ 40], although the number of effect sizes per individual subgroup was not restricted.
As part of thesub-analyses based on nut dose, sensitivity analyses were alsoconducted to explore the effect of whole nuts by removingL. Houston et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1029 –1049 1031 individual studies that assessed the effect of nut oils, nut pow- ders, and/or nut ﬂours from the meta-analysis.Quality assessment All included studies were assessed using the Health Canada Quality Appraisal Tool [ 48].Quality assessment was completed by 1 researcher (EPN), and the presence or absence of a clearlystated hypothesis, statistical power, study duration, and thebackground diet was taken into account when evaluating thequality of each study.The certainty of the body of evidence for interventions included in the meta-analyses was determined using the gradingof recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation(GRADE) [ 49].GRADE evaluates the study design, risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and other consider-ations such as publication bias.
GRADEpro GDT software[GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (software). McMasterUniversity and Evidence Prime, 2022.Available from grade-pro.org] was used to conduct the certainty of evidence appraisal.Results A total of 56,965 articles were identi ﬁed from the systematic search, including the review of relevant reference lists.Afterapplying the exclusion criteria, 153 articles describing 139studies were included in the systematic review and 129 studies in FIGURE 1.PRISMA [ 35]ﬂow diagram of study selection.Abbreviations: CINAHL, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; MEDLINE, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval Sys-tem Online.L.Houston et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1029 –1049 1032 the meta-analysis.Ten studies (11 strata) [ 50–60] were excluded from the meta-analysis because of insuf ﬁcient data reported; therefore, the results of the 11 strata are reported descriptivelybelow for each study outcome.
The process of study inclusionand exclusion is shown in Figure 1 . Characteristics of 139 included studies (81 parallel designs and 58 cross-over designs), including 9099 participants in the meta-analysis, are shown in Supplemental Table 3 .Study dura- tion ranged from 3 –260 wk (or 5 y); only 8 [ 61–72] out of 139 studies (6%) had a duration of >1 y.) Studies were conducted in 25 countries across 6 continents.
The mean participant age was48.3 y, and 116 studies (83%) included both males and females.Studies included participants who were healthy [ 51,53,56,58, 73–105], had risk factors for chronic disease such as overweight or obesity [ 55,57,63,68,69,72,106–132], hyper- cholesterolemia/hyperlipidemia [ 59,60,71,133–160], prediabe- tes [ 61,161–164], at risk of CVD or had diagnosed CVD [ 52, 165–167], at risk of metabolic syndrome or met the criteria for metabolic syndrome [ 64,70,168–176], had type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 54,62,177–193], had diagnosed coronary artery dis- ease [ 194– 198], or included a mixture of health conditions [ 50, 65–67,199–202].
Included studies examined the effects of con- sumption of a range of tree nuts, including walnuts [ 52,56,59,60,62,63,68–70,75,76,81,83,84,86,96–98,102,104,111,116,119, 125,129,134,139,146,151,152,157–159,162,167,170,176,184, 186,187,192,202], almonds [ 50,51,53,57,58,61,72,80,85,89, 90,94,95,103,106,110,112–114, 117,118,120,131–133,143, 153,155,156,160,164,165,177,181–183,191,195,198], pista- chios [ 54,87,121,126,138,141,142,144,145,149,154,161,169, 174,188–190], hazelnuts [ 55,105,128,136,150,178,201], mixed nuts [ 64–67,73,77,99,107,115,130,171,180,196,197], cashews [74,91,179,185], macadamias [ 78,79,82,127,140,147], pecans [92,93,123,137,166,194], Brazil nuts [ 122,168,199,200], and peanuts [ 71,88,100,101,108,109,124,148,163,175,193] as well as comparing 2 different types of nuts [ 135,172,173](Table 1 ).
Nuts were consumed in either prescribed doses, ranging from ~3[59]t o8 8[ 124] g/d for nut oils, ﬂour, and butter and for whole nuts from 8 [ 116] to 168 [ 85] g/d or were included to provide a proportion of dietary energy, for example, 10% [ 178,179]t o 30% [ 100,101] of total energy (equating to ~21 –76 g/d). Effect of nut consumption on study outcomes LDL cholesterol A total of 126 strata from 122 studies explored the effect of nut consumption on LDL cholesterol.

Houston et al. Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1029 –1049 1033 in LDL cholesterol ( Table 2 andFigure 2 ).Of the 126 strata, 35 explored the effect of walnut consumption, and 101 had aduration of /C203 mo.Eleven strata from 10 RCTs [ 50,52–60] were removed from the meta-analysis, of which 2 [ 56,60] reported a signiﬁcant reduction in LDL cholesterol with the consumption of nuts.Subgroup analysis indicated signi ﬁcant differences, including those related to study design, nut type, and healthstatus ( Supplemental Table 4 ).Larger reductions in LDL choles- terol were found in cross-over studies, compared to studies witha parallel design, although the magnitude of effects in thedifferent subgroups is not likely to be clinically signi ﬁcant.
Regarding nut type and health status, it should be noted that thesigniﬁcance of the effects should be interpreted with caution because of the uneven distribution of studies in the subgroups.When studies assessing the effect of nut oils, nut powders, and/ornutﬂours were removed from the dose subgroup analysis, similar results were found in the overall analysis ( Supplemental Table 5 ). TC A total of 126 strata from 122 studies explored the effect of nut consumption on TC.The meta-analysis showed that nutconsumption was associated with a signi ﬁcant decrease in TC (Table 2 andFigure 3 ).Walnuts ( n¼35) and almonds ( n¼33) were the most common nut types in this analysis.Eleven stratafrom 10 RCTs [ 50,52–60] were removed from the meta-analysis, of which 3 [ 54,56,60] reported a signi ﬁcant reduction in TC with the consumption of nuts.
Variation in the magnitude of the effectwas observed for nut type, although these results should beinterpreted with caution because of the uneven distribution ofstudies in the subgroups ( Supplemental Table 6 ). For the nut dose, a signi ﬁcant dose response was found.Stronger effects were observed for >60 g/d; however, there was substantial heterogeneity that should be considered when interpreting re- sults.Findings were similar when studies assessing the effect of nut oils, nut powders, and/or nut ﬂours were removed ( Sup- plemental Table 5 ).TG A total of 122 strata from 118 studies explored the effect of nut consumption on TG.The meta-analysis showed that nutconsumption was associated with a signi ﬁcant decrease in TG (Table 2 andFigure 4 ).Eleven strata from 10 RCTs [ 50,52–60] were removed from the meta-analysis, of which 3 [ 56,59,60] reported a signi ﬁcant reduction in TG with the consumption of nuts.
Subgroup analysis indicated differences related to nut type (Supplemental Table 7 ). However, this signi ﬁcant effect should be interpreted with caution because of the uneven distribution ofstudies included in the subgroups.When studies assessing theeffect of nut oils, nut powders, and/or nut ﬂours were removed from the dose subgroup analysis, results were similar to theoverall analysis ( Supplemental Table 5 ).TC to HDL cholesterol ratio A total of 51 strata from 49 studies explored the effect of nut consumption on TC:HDL cholesterol.The meta-analysis showedthat nut consumption was associated with a signi ﬁcant decrease in TC:HDL cholesterol ( Table 2 andFigure 5 ).
Six strata from 6 RCTs [ 53,54,56,57,60,105] were removed from the meta-analysis, of which 3 [ 53,54,60] reported a signi ﬁcant reduction in TC:HDL cholesterol with the consumption of nuts.The subgroup analyses indicated that a similar magnitude of theeffect was found across the different subgroups ( Supplemental Table 8 ). After removing studies assessing the effect of nut oils, nut powders, and/or nut ﬂours from the dose subgroup analysis, results were similar to the overall analysis ( Supplemental Table 5 ).LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio A total of 39 strata from 38 studies explored the effect of nut consumption on LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol.The meta- analysis showed that nut consumption was associated with asigniﬁcant decrease in LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol ( Table 2 andFigure 6 ).Two strata from 2 RCTs were removed from the meta-analysis, of which both [ 53,54] reported a signi ﬁcant reduction in LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol with the con-sumption of nuts.
Variation in the magnitude of the effect wasobserved for nut type, study duration, and health status ( Sup- plemental Table 9 ).
Although studies with a shorter duration (<12 wk) had a larger decrease in LDL cholesterol:HDL choles- terol than found for studies of /C2112 wk, the magnitude of the effects in the subgroups is not likely to be clinically signi ﬁcant.TABLE 2 Change in outcomes following nut intervention compared to a control Outcome Number of strataNumber of studiesNumber of participantsEffect estimate Inconsistency (I2)% LDL cholesterol, mmol/L 126 122 9487 /C00.11 (/C00.14,/C00.07), P<0.00001 80 HDL cholesterol, mmol/L 126 122 10,102 0.00 ( /C00.01, 0.02), P¼0.59 81 TC, mmol/L 126 122 9423 /C00.13 (/C00.18,/C00.09), P<0.00001 87 TG, mmol/L 122 118 9744 /C00.06 (/C00.08,/C00.03), P<0.00001 61 TG:HDL cholesterol 5 5 331 /C00.12 (/C00.40, 0.15), P¼0.37 0 TC:HDL cholesterol 51 49 3837 /C00.15 (/C00.24,/C00.07), P¼0.0003 68 HDL cholesterol:LDL cholesterol3 3 209 /C00.06 (/C00.23, 0.11), P¼0.46 53 LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol39 38 2539 /C00.14 (/C00.20, 0.08), P<0.00001 75 ApoB, mg/dL 39 39 3069 /C03.01 (/C04.44,/C01.58), P<0.00001 44 ApoA-I, mg/dL 33 33 2259 /C01.02 (/C02.53, 0.49), P¼0.19 0 SBP, mmHg 71 70 6521 /C00.05 (/C00.83, 0.72), P¼0.89 47 DBP, mmHg 67 66 6198 /C00.10 (/C00.53, 0.33), P¼0.65 24 Abbreviations: ApoA-I, apolipprotein A-1; ApoB, apolipoprotein B; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; SBP, systolic blood pressure; TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglycerides.L.

Other signi ﬁcant effects for nut type and health status should be interpreted with caution because of thesmall and/or uneven distribution of studies included in thesubgroups. When studies assessing the effect of nut oils, nutpowders, and/or nut ﬂours were removed from the dose sub- group analysis, similar results were found in the overall analysis(Supplemental Table 5 ).HDL cholesterol, TG to HDL cholesterol ratio, HDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol ratio, apoA-I, SBP, and DBP The meta-analysis showed that consumption of nuts had no signiﬁcant effect on HDL cholesterol and did not result in sig- niﬁcant differences in TG:HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol:LDL cholesterol, apoA-I, SBP, and DBP ( Table 2 and Supplemental Figures 1 –6).In the case of the subgroup analyses, a similar magnitude of the effect was found across the different subgroupsfor apoA-I ( Supplemental Table 11 ) and SBP ( Supplemental Table 12 ).
Although there were signi ﬁcant subgroup differences found for HDL cholesterol ( Supplemental Table 13 ) and DBP (Supplemental Table 14 ) according to health status, these dif- ferences should be interpreted with caution because of the un-even distribution in the number of participants and studiesincluded in the subgroups. Variation in the magnitude of theeffect was also observed for DBP and study duration ( Supple- mental Table 14 ).Although a reduction in DBP was only observed in studies with a duration of 12 or more weeks, itshould be noted that the magnitude of this reduction was small FIGURE 5.Difference in total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio between nut consumption and control.The diamond indicates a weighted mean difference with 95% CIs.Abbreviation: IV, inverse variance.L.Houston et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1029 –1049 1038 and not likely to be clinically signi ﬁcant.
Similar results to the original analysis were found when studies assessing the effect ofnut oils, nut powders, and/or nut ﬂours were removed from the dose subgroup analysis for HDL cholesterol, TG:HDL cholesterol,HDL cholesterol:LDL cholesterol, apoA-I, SBP, and DBP ( Sup- plemental Table 5 ). Heterogeneity Considerable heterogeneity (I 2>75%) was observed for LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and TC (see Table 2 ).In addition, substantial heterogeneity (I2: 50% –75%) was observed for 4 measures (TG, TC:HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol:HDLcholesterol, and HDL cholesterol:LDL cholesterol), moderateheterogeneity (I 2: 36% –60%) for 2 measures (apoB and SBP), whereas low heterogeneity (I2:0 % –35%) was observed for 3 measures (TG:HDL cholesterol, apoA-I, and DBP).
Small study effects Funnel plots were generated for outcomes with 10 or more strata (LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, TC, TG, TC:HDLcholesterol, LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol, apoA-I, apoB, SBP,and DBP) (see Supplemental Figures 7 –16). Egger ’s test out- comes indicated funnel plot asymmetry for LDL cholesterol (bias:/C00.69; 95% CI: /C01.10,/C00.28; P¼0.001), HDL cholesterol (bias: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.07, 1.09; P¼0.027), TC (bias: /C00.82; 95% CI: /C01.33,/C00.31; P¼0.002), TG (bias: /C00.58; 95% CI: /C00.86,/C00.30; P¼0.000), SBP (bias: /C00.61; 95% CI: /C01.11,/C00.12; P¼ 0.016), and DBP (bias: /C00.57; 95% CI: /C00.99,/C00.14; P¼0.010).These results indicate the presence of small study effects, whichmay be caused by publication bias.
By comparison, funnel plotasymmetry was not detected for TC:HDL cholesterol (bias: 0.42;95% CI: /C00.33, 1.16; P¼0.266), LDL cholesterol:HDL choles- terol (bias: 0.14; 95% CI: /C00.63, 0.91; P¼0.713), apoB (bias: 0.35; 95% CI: /C00.20, 0.90; P¼0.205), and apoA-I (bias: 0.42; 95% CI: /C00.34, 1.19; P¼0.268). Quality assessment Quality assessment is presented for each study in Supple- mental Table 3 , with full quality assessment available in Sup- plemental Table 15 .The quality of evidence was “low”forn¼18 intervention studies [ 50,51,53,55,58–60,77,78,82,85,90,100, 101,122,124,127,146,149,150].The certainty of the body of evidence was assessed for studies included in meta-analyses using GRADE, with results presentedinSupplemental Table 16 .The certainty of the body of evidence for apoA-I was “high.
”The body of evidence for TC:HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol, and apoB wasdowngraded to “moderate ”because of inconsistency and for DBP because of the likelihood of publication bias. The certainty forTG and SBP was downgraded to “low”because of inconsistency and the likelihood of publication bias, and the certainty for TG:HDL cholesterol was downgraded to “low”because ofFIGURE 6.Difference in LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio between nut consumption and control.The diamond indicates a weighted mean difference with 95% CIs.Abbreviation: IV, inverse variance.L.Houston et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1029 –1049 1039 imprecision and the likelihood of publication bias.Certainty for LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, TC, was downgraded to “very low”because of the inconsistency and likelihood of publication bias, and HDL cholesterol:LDL cholesterol because of inconsis-tency, imprecision, and the likelihood of publication bias.
Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis showed favorable effects of tree nut and peanut consumption on lowering LDL cholesterol, TC, TG, TC:HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol, and apoB from RCTs including 9099 participants.These ﬁndings align with a review conducted in 2015, which explored the effects of all tree nuts on CVD risk factors [ 22]. The present meta-analysis builds on these ﬁndings with the addition of studies published since the 2015 review [ 22] and focuses solely on RCTs.It also includes studies investigating other nutforms, including nut oils [ 55,59,71,88,100,101,124,147, 158–160,168,186,187,202,203], nut butter [ 88,124], and nut ﬂour [ 199] and adolescents (aged 13 y or older) [ 136].Subgroup analyses found differences across the types of nuts for outcomes, LDL cholesterol, TC, TG, LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol, and apoB.
Having fewer studies within the Brazil nut, cashew nut,hazelnut, macadamia, and pecan subgroups may have played arole in the signi ﬁcant effects observed. A dose response and stronger effects were also observed for >60 g/d for TC.Despite the nut dose response, a reduction in LDL cholesterol, TC, TG,TC:HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol, and apoB,and an increase in HDL were found in /C2030 g/d of nuts.Taken together, this meta-analysis provides a timely effect of tree nutand peanut intake on overall CVD risk reduction, including dose-response relations.The scienti ﬁc evidence indicates that the consumption of nuts is bene ﬁcial to positive changes in many biomarkers of CVD.Although biomarkers were assessed in this review, the popula- tion effect for LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, TC, and TG was based on >4500 interventions and >4500 control participants, and SBP and DBP were based on >3000 interventions and >3000 control participants.
This substantial population size for high-quality study designs indicates signi ﬁcant reductions in LDL cholesterol, TC, and TG and no change in HDL cholesterol.Despite the heterogeneity, this combined effect suggests thatnuts do not simply display positive changes to 1 biomarker ofCVD risk but a range of biomarkers to create an overall riskreduction. Although the ﬁndings of the SBP and DBP studies indicated a nonsigni ﬁcant reduction, there was less heteroge- neity which is of clinical relevance.The effects on HDL choles- terol were also not indicative of risk reduction, though the meta-analysis suggested no change, which is also a favorable outcome.Both blood lipids and blood pressure are major risk factors forCVD and are included in the Framingham risk equation [ 204], used globally by clinicians.Therefore, this review provides evi- dence of a causal link between nut intake and lower CVD risk.
In this review, we observed that there were signi ﬁcant dif- ferences in outcomes (LDL cholesterol, TC, TG, LDL cholester-ol:HDL cholesterol, and apoB) across different types of nuts.Consideration is needed when interpreting the ﬁndings of this review as it is unclear whether all or some types of nuts are preferential for improving CVD risk. This review suggestsstronger evidence for almonds and walnuts because of theFIGURE 7.Difference in apoB (mg/dL) between nut consumption and control.The diamond indicates a weighted mean difference with 95% CIs.Abbreviation: IV, inverse variance.L.Houston et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1029 –1049 1040 greater number of studies ( n>30), and therefore more studies are needed for other nut types.Ourﬁndings suggest a dose response was observed for tree nut and peanut consumption of >60 g/d for TC.
Similar ﬁndings were reported in a recent meta-analysis of RCTs and non-RCTs inthisﬁeld [ 22], which showed the relationship between tree nut intake and TC and LDL cholesterol was nonlinear, with stronger effects at >60 g/d. However, the scienti ﬁc evidence suggests that consumers typically do not meet recommended serving sizes of15–30 g.In Australia, for example, nut intake was estimated at an average of 4.61 g/d, with only 5.6% of the populationconsuming the recommended daily amount of nuts [ 205].Public health messaging needs to support reasons for consumers to in-crease their intake of nuts.However, nuts, as a food groupbecause of their high-fat content, have been related to consumerconcerns about weight gain, a risk factor for CVD.While thisreview did not look at body weight, a recent meta-analysis of 106 RCTs and 6 prospective cohorts showed that higher nut intake was associated with reductions in body weight and body fat[206].
Establishing health messages about the regular con- sumption of nuts to reduce CVD risk may shift consumer opinionand add to the acknowledgment of core foods for positive life-style change related to CVD risk. Consideration should be given when interpreting ﬁndings from this review, which included only RCTs when compared toreal-life consumer settings, as they are substantially different.RCTs aiming to explore the in ﬂuence of speci ﬁc foods must consider many methodological challenges, including the design of the dietary intervention and control arms to avoid increases in total energy intake, which could skew results [ 207].Although a dose response was reported for TC, several studies incorporatednuts as a proportion of a participant ’s total energy, resulting in substantial variation between individual nut doses.Whether theenergy value of nuts was adjusted for in the total diet may alsoinﬂuence the results.
We did not consider in our subgroup analysis whether the energy provided by nuts was accounted forby dietary modeling or advice to substitute other foods or nuts,though there is evidence suggesting that energy-restricted dietsare effective in improving the blood lipid pro ﬁle [208] and blood pressure [ 209]. This highlights the importance of total energy intake and should be considered in future meta-analyses.Further, energy-restricted diet studies that were designed forweight loss were included in this analysis.As weight loss is asigniﬁcant contributor to improving CVD risk factors, it is chal- lenging to determine whether the effects observed from this re-view were from nuts alone or if further bene ﬁts were obtained from the additional weight loss.The design of the control armmay have also impacted our results; for example, Agebratt et al.[73] compared nut intake with a control intervention (that is, fruit), which may have potentially in ﬂuenced the control effects.
A previous meta-analysis has highlighted the potential impact of control groups on underestimating intervention effects inweight-loss RCTs [ 210]. Thus, RCTs that aim to explore the in- ﬂuence of speci ﬁc foods should carefully design the dietary intervention and control arms to avoid a total energy increase toskew results.Despite these challenges, the most recentmeta-analyses of prospective cohort studies in this ﬁeld [ 21] have shown an inverse association between nut consumptionand CVD incidence and mortality.Taken together, this reviewprovides the most recent evidence that the ﬁndings from RCTsconducted in highly controlled conditions support the ﬁndings from observational studies that re ﬂect free-living populations.This review has several strengths and limitations.A notable strength was that the processes followed current guidelines inreview conduct, reporting, and analysis.
The review is groundedin the evidence with ﬁndings aligned to previous reviews of observational studies and 1 review of randomized and non- randomized trials. We considered a range of outcomes associatedwith CVD, including blood lipids, apolpoproteins,and bloodpressure.In a recent review by the authors, the effects of nuts andinﬂammation (c-reactive protein, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1,and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) reported nonsigni ﬁcant changes because of a lack of consistent available evidence, and asa result, such variables were not included in this review [ 211].However, we recognize that the outcomes explored in this re-view are not interchangeable with disease endpoints such as CVD mortality and morbidity.The range of population groups addressed in the included studies of this review may be consid-ered both a strength and a limitation.
The populations includedsome groups who had existing risk factors for CVD, such asoverweight and type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas others wereconsidered “healthy ”populations. Because of the existing comorbidities, the effect size of some studies may appear greaterthan if all studies targeted a healthy population.For cross-overtrials, there were no additional exclusion criteria applied,which meant studies using this design were not required to meeta“sufﬁcient ”wash-out period for inclusion in this review.This may have resulted in potential carryover effects, though the potential impact on the results was considered in the qualityappraisal.These above-mentioned points need to be consideredwhen interpreting the ﬁndings.The heterogeneity of the evidence included can also be considered a limitation.Variation existed because of study designand duration, participant health status, nut type, and dose,although these factors were explored in subgroup analyses.
Inparticular, relatively few studies in some nut types (Brazil nut,cashew nut, hazelnut, macadamia, and pecan) limit the statisticalpower to detect a potential interaction that needs to be considered in relation to the whole body of evidence. Of the different tree nut types, all tree nuts except chestnuts were addressed in the body ofevidence that was reviewed.The lower fat pro ﬁle of chestnuts suggests that they could mechanistically work differently fromother nut types [ 212].In addition, pine nuts were only included in 1 study as part of mixed nuts consumed by participants [ 171].Thought should be given to the variability of nuts as a food group,as there are a number of methodological challenges relating to thestudy of dietary patterns and CVD.One major challenge is relatedto the way food groups are formed and the limitations of thedifferent food composition databases used to analyze the out- comes, especially if energy is adjusted [ 213].
Background diets also varied between studies, with some prescribing dietaryguidelines, whereas others advised participants to follow theirhabitual diet, which may have varied considerably between in-dividuals. For 1 study, the PREDIMED study [ 65–67], we considered the olive oil arm to be the control arm when comparedwith the other Mediterranean diet arms.The authors acknowl-edge that olive oil provides unsaturated fats and has been asso-ciated with lipid-lowering properties.This comparison, however,eliminates the confounding nature of the overall MediterraneanL.Houston et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 1029 –1049 1041 diet, allowing for the comparison between nut and olive oil con- sumption.Similarly, 1 study [ 176] also included seeds in their control diet.Although linseeds have a similar nutrient pro ﬁle to nuts, a meta-analysis reported particular doses and participantcharacteristics to in ﬂuence the lipid-lowering effect [ 214].
Analysis of funnel plots suggested the results for LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, TC, TG, SBP, and DBP may have been in ﬂuenced by small study effects, which may be caused by publication bias.This resulted in downgrading the quality of evidence for theseoutcomes. Finally, although we were unable to explore the dis-tribution of the published data included in this meta-analysis,several studies reported median values rather than means,which may suggest that some of the data was skewed and mayhave impacted our analyses.In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of tree nut and peanut consumption on improving risk ofCVD ﬁnds evidence of signi ﬁcantly favorable effects on LDL cholesterol, TC, TG, TC:HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol, and apoB.The nonsigni ﬁcant differences in SBP and DBP suggest a lack of consistent evidence for the effects of treenuts and peanuts on blood pressure.
The results should also beinterpreted with caution because of the large variation in theincluded studies. The ﬁndings of this review provide further insight into the combined effect that tree nuts and peanuts do notsimply display positive changes to 1 biomarker of CVD risk but arange of biomarkers to create an overall risk reduction.Theﬁndings of this review also build on previous observational and intervention meta-analyses, which have shown an inverse asso- ciation between nut consumption and risk of CVD.Although stronger effects are observed for tree nut and peanut consump-tion of >60 g/d for LDL cholesterol and TC, most dietary guidelines recommend the consumption of 15 –30 g as a serving size.Importantly, this review shows a reduction in LDL choles-terol, TC, TG, TC:HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol:HDL choles-terol, and apoB, and an increase in HDL with the consumption of/C2030 g/d of nuts, supporting dietary guidelines.
As consumers are not currently meeting these recommendations, public healthmessaging is needed to support reasons for consumers to increasetheir intake of nuts, which also have favorable effects on risk of CVD.
