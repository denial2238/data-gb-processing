Four types of Vienna sausages (S1: 10% ES and 50% chicken, S2: 20% E S and 40% chicken, S3: 30% ES and 30% chicken, and S4: 40% ES and 20% chicken) for this study were made. The pH, color, proximate composition, sodium dodecyl sulf ate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), microphotographs, cooking yields, a nd texture profile analysis of sausages were examined.The pH value of uncooked an d cooked sausages increased significantly with increasing ES content (p<0.05).Th e crude protein contents of S2, S3, and S4 were significantly higher than that of the co ntrol (p<0.05).Furthermore, the SDS-PAGE results showed that α-conglycinin, β-conglycinin, and the acidic subunit of glycinin all increased with increasing ES content.Microphot ographs revealed that increasing the ES content decreased the size of fat globules.T he cooking yields of samples increased significantly with increasing ES content (p<0 .05).
The hardness values of ES treated samples were significantly lower than that of the control (p<0.05). Therefore, 30% substitute of chicken breast with ES can improve the quality and structure of Vienna sausage, without inducing critical defects.Keywords chicken, partial meat replacemen t, quality properties, sausage, soybean Introduction The global development of indust rialization has induced a world wide increase in meat-based diets, including processed meat (You et al., 2020).Among the various types of meat, chicken is a popular source of protein due to its low fat, high protein, and balanced amino acid contents.It is therefore recognized by mod ern consumers as an ideal meat source in the current trend towards healthy eating ( Hwang et al., 2020; Kawecki et al., 2021).Consequently, chicken consumption worldw ide increased by 2.9% from 6.08 million tons in 1999 to 6.25 million tons in 201 5; it is expected to further increase by another 2.4% from 2015 to 2030 (Bruinsma, 2 017).
ARTICLE Food Science of Animal Resources V ol. 42, No.1, 2022 74 Meat is an important source of protein that is rich in essentia l amino acids such as histidine, lysine, and methionine.However, some consumers have a negative perception towards meat due to the concern that excessive meat consumption can lead to an increase in the incidence of metabolic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and due to ethical issues such as animal welfare (Argel et al., 2020; Cha et al., 2020).To resol ve the concerns, vegetable proteins are attracting attention as an alternative to animal proteins (Park, 2021).When vegetable pro teins are incorporated into meat products, their nutrients and dietary fibers assist in improving the nutritional and quality characteristics of the products, as well as reducing their production costs due to an increase in water holding capacity ( Besbes et al., 2008).
Furthermor e, vegetable proteins exert positive effects such as preventing vascular diseases, being an ti-cancerous, and providing antioxidant effects. Among the various available vegetable proteins, soybeans ( Glycine max [L.] Merrill) are often used as protein supplements and protein substitutes due to their aforementioned effects and their high protein content (Chalvon-Demersay et al., 2017; Parniakov et al., 2018).Soybeans are widely utilized in various products, such as tofu, soybean milk, and cooking oil, due to their excellent processing quality.Furthermore, their high protein content (as high as approximately 40%) means that they are among the most commonly used vegetable pro teins (Kouakou et al., 2019).I n addition, they contain many biologically active substances, such as isoflavone, which prevents adult diseases; saponin, whi ch excels in preventing cancer; and lecithin, which reduces cholesterol levels.
Thus, soybeans are often utilized as health products (Muramatsu et al., 2017). Furthermore, soybean proteins have been used as additives to enhance the quality cha racteristics of meat products, and previous studies have been conducted into incorporating vegetable proteins into meat produ cts to fulfill the role of meat or fat (Park et al., 2020; Poli zer et al., 2015; Tarté et al., 2020).However, although researches have been conducted into processed meat products produced by incorporating soybean proteins, there have been few studies on assessing their qualit y.Therefore, in this study we aimed to produce chicken breast Vienna sausages by partially substituting meat with soybean pro tein and to compare their quality characteristics to determine their optimal addition ratio.
Materials and Methods Preparation of chicken Vienna sausage with soybean emulsion The base of the chicken Vienna sausages were made with chicken breast (Maniker, Seoul, Korea) and pork back fat; they were ground using a grinder (PA-82, Mainca, Barcelona , Spain). The emulsion manufactured with soybeans (ES) was manufactured with soybean (Nonsan, Korea; moisture: 12.42%, cru de protein: 43.36%, crude fa t: 15.10%, crude ash: 5.02%, pH: 6.51).Also to form of emulsion, added vital wheat gluten ( Vegefood, Namyangju, Korea; pH: 6.60).It was mixed using a hand blender (HR2652, Philips, Amsterdam, Nederlands) with 35 % soybean, 25% vital wheat gluten, and 40% water of the ratio (Cho et al., 2014).After the preparation of the main mat erials, emulsified materials were manufactured using a bowl cutter (K-30, Talsa, Valencia, Spain).The formulations of the Vienna sausages were taken from Mousavi et al.(2019); they are presented in Table 1.
The Vienna sausage emulsions were fil led into natural pork intestine casings using a stuffer (EM-12, Mainca), and cooked for 30 min in a chamber at 80℃ (10.10ESI/SK , Alto Shaam, Menomonee Falls, WI, USA) with a core temperature was 70℃. After cooked, each sausage was cooled at 1 0℃ for 20 min and stored at 4℃ and used for the experiment.Replacing Chicken Breast with Soy bean Protein Emulsion in Vienn a Sausage 75 pH The samples for pH analysis were prepared by mixing samples wit h distilled water (1:4, v/v) using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer (HMZ-20DN, Pooglim Tech., Seongnam, Korea) for 1 min at 6,991 ×g.pH was then determined using a pH meter (Model S220, Mettler-Tole do, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland).
Color Samples’ cutting surf aces were evaluated using a colorimeter bo th before and after cookin g (CR-10, Minolta, Tokyo, Japan, calibrated with a white plate, CIE L*: +97.83, CIE a*: – 0.43, and CIE b*: +1.98); the lightness (CIE L*), redness (CIE a*), and yellowness (C IE b*) were recorded. Proximate composition The proximate compositions of the chicken Vienna sausages were determined using Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) guidelines (AOAC, 2010).Moisture content was d etermined by drying samples in an oven at 105℃, the crude protein content was determined via the Kjeldahl method (A OAC 928.08), crude fat content was determined via the Soxhlet method (AOAC 991.36), and the crude ash content was det ermined using the dry ashing method at 550℃ (AOAC 920.153).
Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS- PAGE) Relevant protein levels were asse ssed with SDS-PAGE analysis us ing gradient gel (Mini-protein TGX gels 4%–20%, Bio- rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The supernatants of the samples were m ixed with 3 mM phosphate buffer and 5 × sample buffer to make 200 µg/mL of total protein volume.Then, 15 µL of each sam ple was added to each well of the gel, before being processed for 1 h and 20 min.The gel was then removed and fixe d in a fixing solution, incubated overnight using a rocker, and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue for 20 min, while und er gentle agitation.The dye was removed with a destaining Table 1.

Microphotographs The samples for microphotograph analysis were stored at –80℃ in a deep freezer (TSE320GPD, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) for 24 h. The samples were then sliced into 10 µm slic es using a cryostat (CM3050S, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany).The sliced samples were then observed and scanned usi ng an upright clinical microscope (Eclipse Ci-L, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).Cooking yield The cooking yields of the samples were weighed both before and after cooking and then after cooling at 10℃ for 20 min.The cooking yield was determined from these weights; it was cal culated with the following formula.Cooking yield ሺ%ሻ= Sample weight after cooking (g) Sample weight bef ore cooking (g)×100 Texture profile analysis (TPA) TPA was measured by citing the measurement methods of Shin and Choi (2021).The cooked s amples were cut into ф 2.5×2.0 cm (diameter×height) pi eces.
Sample texture profile ana lysis were measured using a texture analyzer (TA 1, Lloyd, Largo, USA); the machine analyzing conditions were as follows: cylinder probe of 100 mm with a pre-test speed of 2.0 mm/s, a post-test speed of 5.0 mm/s, a maximum load of 2 kg, a head s peed of 2.0 mm/s, a distance of 8.0 mm, and a force of 5 g. Hardness (kg), springiness, and cohesiveness were measured and recorded; these values were utilized to calculate gumminess (hardness×cohesiveness, kg) and chewiness (springiness×gummines s, kg).Statistical analysis All experimental results were assessed after a minimum of three repeated trials.Statistical analyses were performed using SAS® (version 9.3 for window, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA); result s are indicated herein as mean values and SD.Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan’s multiple range tests were perf ormed to verify the significance of each difference in each characteristics.
Results and Discussion pH and color Table 2 shows the results of pH and color of chicken Vienna sau sages, according to the amount of ES added. The pH before cooking significantly increased with increasing ES conte nt (p<0.05).The pH after cooking tended to increase with increasing ES content; the S3 and S4 showed significantly highe r values than the other samples and the control (p<0.05).The results of this study were similar to the results reported by D zudie et al.(2002), who stated that the pH of beef sausage increased as the proportion of soybean protein substitutes incr eased.The pH of soybeans is known to be approximately 6.6; it is determined by the acidic subunits incorporated in soybeans ( Chang, 1988; Lu et al., 2020).Therefore, this result suggests that the pH of soybeans can indu ce an increase in processing yi eld when using ES as a meat substitute.
Replacing Chicken Breast with Soy bean Protein Emulsion in Vienn a Sausage 77 The lightness before cooking showed that the S4 exhibited signi ficantly higher values than the control and other samples (p<0.05). Furthermore, the lightness after cooking was signific antly higher in the control than in all the other samples (p<0.05).The relatively lower lightness observed in the ES tre ated samples after cooking might be resulted from the Maillard reaction through the browning of soybean proteins (Kwok et al., 1999).Significantly higher redness levels were observed in the control than in the ES treated samples, both before and aft er cooking (p<0.05).These results could be due to the absence of any pigments that affect redness (such as myoglobin) in soyb ean proteins.Thus, the proportion of meat pigment in the overall emulsions decreased with increasing ES content (Adeniyi et al., 2018).
There was no significant difference in yellowness before cooking between the control and the ES treate d s a m p l e s , b u t t h e S 4 s h o w e d a s i g n i f i c a n t l y h i g h e r yellowness value than the control and other samples after cooki ng (p<0.05). Yoon and Kim (2007) reported that the yellowness of the soybean protein increased with increased heat ing temperature due to the Maillard reaction.Thus, it is thought that in this study the Maillard reaction of ES (when us ed to replace chicken breast) affected the lightness and yellowness.Therefore, it is assumed that the lack of meat pigm ents can be resolved through the substitution with the Maillard reaction and improves quality.Proximate composition and SDS-PAGE results The proximate composition of the chicken Vienna sausages accord ing to the amount of ES added are illustrated in Table 3.There was no significant difference in the moisture and ash con tents according to the substitution ratio of ES.
S2, S3, and S4 showed significantly higher protein content values than the con trol (p<0.05). However, S4 also showed a significantly lower crude fat content than the control (p<0.05).These results coul d be due to differences in the proximate compositions of chicken breast and soybeans.Chicken breast is known to be comp rised of approximately 22.04% protein, whereas soybean comprises approximately 40.00% pr otein (Javaid et al., 2017; Kr ishnan et al., 2000).Thus, increasing the ES content increased the protein contents of the produced sausages (Ali et al., 2007; Jung et al., 2003).Thus, here the protein content may have increased due to the increased ES content, which resul ted in a relative decrease in the fat content.Table 2.

Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.42, No.1, 2022 78 Fig.1 illustrates the SDS-PAGE analysis of the chicken Vienna sausages according to the amount of ES treated.Soybean proteins are composed of four fractions: α, α′, β-conglycinin, and glycinin.Among them, glycinin is composed of acidic proteins and basic proteins, its quaternary structure has organ ized larger hydrophilic area than meat proteins (Salas et al., 2013).The SDS-PAGE results rev ealed that the contents of α-con glycinin (71.5–75.0 kDa), β-conglycinin (48.4–55.2 kDa), and acidic proteins (34.0–38.9 kDa) all tended to increase as t he amount of ES treated increased.
Heating the soybean proteins did not destroy β-conglycinin, acidic proteins, or bas ic proteins, implying that the increase in the contents of β- conglycinin, acidic proteins, and basic proteins in the SDS-PAG E analyses resulted from the increased proportion of supplemented soybean proteins (Peñta-Ramos and Xiong, 2002). Fu rthermore, Wang et al.(2017a) reported that β- conglycinin exhibits antioxidant activity when hydrolyzed.Impl ying that if soybean proteins were to be used as substitutes for some meats, it would be possible to produce functional meat products that exhibit antioxidant activity through the hydrolysis of β-conglycinin during the digestion process in the body, while still maintaining protein content levels similar t o those of the existing meat products.Table 3.

Paulson and Tung (1989) found similar results when using vegetable protein em ulsions to partially r eplace meat, stating that increasing the substitution ratio of soybean protein decreased pore size, which in turn decreased the sizes of the f at globules. And soybean protein s are mostly made up of water- soluble proteins, meaning that t hey exhibit an enhanced emulsif ying capacity.This increases the bonding between the protein and the fat molecule, and ultimately produces a sausage with a more delicate structure (Ramezan i et al., 2003).Furthermore, the large aggregate size of soybean protein is accompanied by a large hydrophobic domain on surfaces.This means that the emulsifying capacity would increase during the initial emulsion process, causing a relative decrease in fat globule size (Wang et al., 2017b).Therefore, adding ES can enable the production of more structurally stable sausages.
The cooking yields of chicken Vienna sausages with differing am ounts of ES treated are illustrated in Fig. 3.The cooking yields can be affected by various factors, such as temperature, pH, viscosity, the functionality of the myofibrillar protein, and fat globules (Trindade et al., 2011).The result of cooking yie lds in this study showed that the cooking yields significantly increased with increasing ES sub stitution ratio (p<0.05).These results are similar to those obtained during a study into pork patties conducted by Argel et al.(2020), which stated that the cooking yields increased as the meat was partially replaced with soybean protein.Gao et al .(2015) also reported that the structure of a sausage becomes r efined by water-soluble protein s within the added soybean and that the cooking yields can be enh anced by reducing the excretion of moisture.
Taken together, the increase in cooking yields observed in this study may resul t from the delicate protein struct ures of the sausages arising from an increase in the substitution ratio of soybean proteins.

The hardness, gumminess, and chewiness of the control was significa ntly higher than the samples tr eated ES (p<0.05). Bernasconi et al.(2020) reported that the decrease in the hardness and ch ewiness of new patties in which soybean proteins were used as meat substitute may have resulted from an increase in moisture retention triggered by soybean protein; the same mechanism may have affected the results of our study.Also through the SD S-PAGE results, increasing of ES brings increase of glycinin contents, and it made Vienna sausages’s structure more densely.And it increased water holding capacity and made softer texture.There was no significant difference in the springiness between the control and the other samples, while the S2, S3, and S4 exhibited significantly higher cohesiveness values than the control (p<0.05).Biswas et al.(2011) reported that incorporating soybean proteins can effectively increase the coh esiveness of emulsified meat p roducts.
These results can be explained by the adhesion of meat protein particles that occurs due to the film-forming properties of the soybean proteins.

Replacing Chicken Breast with Soy bean Protein Emulsion in Vienn a Sausage 81 And this ultimately increases the cohesiveness (Wolf, 1970). Th erefore, we believe that the replacement of chicken with ES, as featured in this study, increased the cohesiveness of the re sulting sausage.This subsequently increased cooking yields; it is also expected that products containing ES can exhibit softer te xtures to those of the conventional meat products.Conclusion Crude protein content and SDS-PAGE analyses suggested that usin g ES as a meat substitute for chicken breast-based Vienna sausage improved protein quality.Microphotographs showe d smaller fat globule in S3 and S4.And the analysis of cooking yields increased with inc reasing percentage of ES.Thes e results suggested that substitution of meat by ES brought improvement of emulsifying activity.As the percentage of ES in creased, hardness were decreased rather cohesiveness were increased.
Especially S3 showed lowest hardness and highest coh esiveness. And these results means ES softened texture by increasing cooking yields and mak ing delicate structure.In con clusion, using each 30% of ES and chicken breast is the suitable ratio for developing protein-enriched meat products.Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no poten tial conflicts of interest.Acknowledgements This work was carried out with the support of “Cooperative Rese arch Program for Agricultu re Science & Technology Development (Project No.PJ015281032021)” Rural Development Adm inistration, Korea.Author Contributions Conceptualization: Kang KM.Data curation: Kang KM, Kim HY .For mal analysis: Kang KM, Lee SH.Methodology: Kim HY .Software: Lee SH, Kim HY .Validation: Kim HY .Investigation : Kang KM, Lee SH.Writing - original draft: Kang KM.Writing - review & editing: K ang KM, Lee SH, Kim HY .
