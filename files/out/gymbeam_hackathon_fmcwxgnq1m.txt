Endogenous L-carnitine (LC) and its deriva tive acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) play antidepressant roles by improving brain energy m etabolism, regulating neurotransmitters and neural plasticity.The levels of ALC in people and rodents with depression are signiﬁcantly reduced.
It is necessary to det ermine whether serum LC and ALC might be used as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of MDD. Here, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrome try (UPLC-MS/MS) was used to determine the concentration of LC and ALC in the serum of healthy controls and patients with MDD; among the latter, in patients who were res ponsive (effective group) and non-responsive (ineffective group) after 2 weeks of tre atment.The diagnostic value of serum LC and ALC for MDD was assessed.Compared with health y controls, the serum LC and ALC concentrations in patients with MDD were sig niﬁcantly decreased ( P <0.001).Pearson correlation analysis shows that the HDRS-2 4 score was negatively associated with serum ALC ( r= −0.325,P=0.007).
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 1 with 83.1% sensitivity and 66.3% speciﬁcity for LC, and an AUC of 0.898 with 88.8% sen sitivity and 76.4% speciﬁcity for ALC, differentiating patients with MDD from healthy controls. Furthermore, the concentration of LC and ALC in patients with depression w as signiﬁcantly increased intheeffectivetreatmentgroup,andnosigniﬁcantchangew asobservedintheineffective treatmentgroup.TheseresultssuggestthatserumLCandALC maybenovelbiomarkers for the diagnosis of MDD.Keywords: biomarker, acetyl-l-carnitine, diagnosis, depr ession, L-Carnitine INTRODUCTION Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder tha t is the leading cause of disability around the World ( 1,2).According to a recent survey, the lifetime and 12-month prevalence rates of depression in China are 3.4 and 2.1%, respect ively (3).
The pathogenesis of the disease is relatively complex, which is generally conside red to be related to genetics, sex, neuroendocrine, psychosocial environment, immunity, intestinal microorganisms, and other factors (4–6). At present, clinical diagnosis is mainly based on the descr iption of symptoms by Nie et al.L-Carnitine Acetyl-L-Carnitine Biomarkers for Depressio n the patient, mental state examination, and clinical behavio r observation, lacking objective diagnosis indicators ( 7–9), which greatly increases the incorrect diagnosis.The eﬀect of drug therapy is not obvious in some patients, which is also related to incorrect diagnosis ( 10).Therefore, it is of great signiﬁcance to explore the pathogenesis of depression and search for biomarkers for the diagnosis and diversiﬁed treatment of clinicaldepression.Studies have shown that neuroplasticity impairment may be the signiﬁcant pathophysiological mechanism of depression ( 11, 12).
In addition, studies demonstrated that acetyl-L-carniti ne (ALC) has multiple functions related to neuroplasticity ( 13) and is an antidepressant substance with signiﬁcant potential. AL C is a natural form of L-carnitine (LC).High concentrations o f carnitines either free carnitine or as acylcarnitines incl uding ALC, are present in biological tissues and cells ( 14).ALC is an endogenous compound, and it is mainly present in brain, kidney, and liver.Its main physiological function is to promo te coenzyme A to enter into the mitochondria, thus promoting β- oxidationoflong-chainfattyacids( 15).Inadditiontoimproving mitochondrial function and energy, and enhancing antioxid ant activity (16), ALC has been shown to be eﬀective in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (17, 18), attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder ( 19), depression (20) and depressive symptoms in the course of ﬁbromyalgia (21), multiple sclerosis ( 22), and alcohol dependence ( 23).
In addition, animal studies ( 24–26) have shown that, in rodents withdepression-likecharacteristics,ALClevelsweresign iﬁcantly reduced, ALC supplementation can induce rapid and durable antidepressant-like eﬀects through the epigenetic mechanism of histone acetylation, antidepressant responses were seen aft er 3 d that also last for 14 d after drug withdrawal. The clinical researchresults( 27,28)showedthatserumALClevelsinpatients with severe depression are signiﬁcantly lower than those in healthy people, and ALC supplementation signiﬁcantly reduced depressivesymptoms.Acetyl-CoA and LC in the body are synthesized into ALC by carnitine acetyltransferase catalyzed.LC is also invol ved in the β-oxidation pathway.The deﬁcit of LC can result in impairment of β-oxidation, which in turn leads to the consumptionofacetyl-CoA,andultimatelyleadstothereduc tion of ALC production ( 29).There is also a certain relationship between LC and depression.
Studies ( 30,31) have reported that serum free carnitine levels were signiﬁcantly reduced in patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment, and free carni tine levels with a low baseline level are independently associate d with the severity of depression in male patients. Clinical stud ies (31,32) have shown that L-carnitine supplementation can improve the depression state of male uremic patients and cancerpatients.
Therefore, we aimed to apply UPLC-MS/MS method to determinetheconcentrationsofLCandALCinserum,compare the diﬀerences in the levels of LC and ALC between MDD patients and healthy controls; analyze the levels of LC and ALC correlation with the degree of depression; and study the role of ALC and LC levels in the onset and diagnosis ofdepression.MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants A total of 261 individuals with a ﬁrst depression episode (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Psychiatric Disorders, fourth edition) hospitalized at the Anhui Mental Health Center from November 2018 to October 2020, were scanned in this study, 89 patients with MDD were selected.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: the age ranged from 1 8 to 70 years; a primary diagnosis of MDD in a current major depressive episode; the reduction rate of the 24-item Hamilto n Depression-Rating Scale (HDRS-24) score in the treatment- eﬀective group was ≥50% and the reduction rate of HDRS- 24 score in the treatment-ineﬀective group was <50% (33). A signiﬁcant improvement in patients’ depressive symptoms was observed after treatment in the eﬀective-treatment group.Th e exclusioncriteriawereasfollows:alcoholanddrugabuser s;useof immunomodulators, various antidepressants, or lithium salt s in thelasthalfyear;historyofseriousheart,liver,kidney, andother seriousbodydiseases,metabolicdiseases,andinfectiousdi seases suchascoldandfeverinthelast2weeks;combinationwithot her mental illness or nervous system disease history; pregnancy an d lactation.The healthy control (HC) individuals were recru ited from the Anhui Medical University Health Checkup Center.
HC were free of lifelong mental and major illnesses and metaboli c diseases. The subjects had no active infections and systemi c diseases conﬁrmed by the medical history at the time of the study evaluation.Blood samples were collected from the vein through standard techniques before the evaluation meeting and all subjects were fasting.Tubes with a 5mL capacity were used to collect the blood.Samples were centrifuged at 3,000 r/min for 5min at 4◦C and the serum was collected.The serum was storedat−80◦Cforfurtheruse.Accordingtotheprinciplesofthe Declaration of Helsinki, all subjects provided informed wri tten consent before participating.This study was approved by the EthicsCommitteeoftheAnhuiProvincialMentalHealthCente r.Allourresearcheshavebeenadheredtostandardbiosecurity and institutionalsafetyprocedures.Clinical assessment consisted of a physical examination, including measures of height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and biochemical indexes.
Additional information was colle cted, including demographics, current drug use, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score and HDRS-24 score. Regarding drug use, 89 patients with a ﬁrst depression episode did not take any antidepressants while they participated in the study.In addit ion, weevaluatedtheLCandALClevelsof55patientsaftertreatme nt.Blood samples were collected through the vein 2–6 weeks after treatment, and were divided into treatment-eﬀective group a nd treatment-ineﬀective group according to the HDRS-24 score reductionrate.UPLC-MS/MS Determination of LC and ALC A simple, rapid, and selective UPLC-MS/MS method for the determination of LC and ALC in human serum was developed.The UPLC-MS/MS instrumentation was composed of a Waters Acquity ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) I Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 2 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 671151 Nie et al.

The serum LC and ALC concentrations of all the individuals in the HC and MDD groups were compared with an independent-sample t-test and the serum LC and ALC concentrations of MDD before and after treatment were compared with a paired-sample t-test. The relation between HDRS-24 scores and the other variables were analyzed with Pearson correlation tests and the independent relationships were determined by multivariate linear regression analysis .The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was us ed to determine the area under the curve (AUC) and cut-oﬀ values of serum LC and ALC.P<0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the data are expressed as mean±SD.
RESULTS LC and ALC Levels Differ Between Healthy Controls and Patients With MDD There were no diﬀerences in age, BMI, gender, and other demographic characteristics between the HC ( n=89) and FIGURE 1 | Decreased acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) and L-carnitine (LC) l evels in patients with MDD compared to those in the HC group. (A)Serum LC concentrations in HC and patients with MDD; (B)ALC concentrations in HC and patients with MDD.P<0.001 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.Dashed bars indicate group mean.patients with MDD ( n=89) (Table1).All the patients were in an acute depressive episode during study participation.The level of LC in the MDD group was lower than that in the HC (Figure1A ,P<0.001,t=8.01, eﬀect size =1.20, Power =1.00, HC: 6.64 µg/mL±1.20, MDD: 5.12 µg/mL±1.33).Similarly, the level of ALC in the MDD group was signiﬁcantly lower than that in the HC group ( Figure1B ,P<0.001,t=9.93, eﬀectsize =1.49, Power =1.00, HC: 3.05 µg/mL±1.30, MDD: 1.54µg/mL±0.60).
In patients with moderate to severe MDD (HDRS-24 score >24), ALC levels were signiﬁcantly negatively correlated wi th severity scores: the higher the severity, the lower the ALC concentrations (r = −0.325,P=0.007) (Figure2). In the multiple regression analysis controlling for BMI value, gende r, and age, this relationship was still signiﬁcant ( t= −2.79,P= 0.007).No correlation was found between LC concentration a nd HDRS-24scores( r=−0.135,P=0.271).In addition, the ROC curve analysis showed potential diagnostic values of serum ALC and LC ( Figure3).The AUC of LC and ALC were 0.801 and 0.898, respectively.When the criticalvalueofLCwas5.52 µg/mL,thesensitivityandspeciﬁcity of MDD patients and HC were 83.1 and 66.3%, respectively.At theALCcriticalconcentrationof1.835 µg/mL,thesensitivitywas 88.8%, and the speciﬁcity was 76.4%.When the LC and ALC Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 3 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 671151 Nie et al.

Finally, fro m June 2019 to October 2020, sera were collected from 38 patients with eﬀective treatment and 17 patients with ineﬀectiv e treatment. There were no diﬀerences in age, BMI, gender, HDRS-24 scores before treatment, treatment days and other demographic characteristicsbetween the eﬀective-treatmen tand ineﬀective-treatment groups, there was signiﬁcant diﬀerence i n the reduction rate of HDRS-24 scores and HDRS-24 scores after treatment between the two groups ( Table2).Additionally, the results of covariance analysis showed that the diﬀerence of reduction rate of HDRS-24 scores between eﬀective group and ineﬀective group was not aﬀected by treatment days and the HDRS-24 scores before treatment ( F=17.26,P<0.001).
In the eﬀective-treatment group, the LC levels were signiﬁcantl y higher after treatment compared to those before treatment ( t= −3.53,P=0.001,sizeeﬀect =0.53)(Table3).Similarly,theALC levels were signiﬁcantly higher after treatment than those before treatment( t=−2.05,P=0.047,sizeeﬀect =0.32)(Table3).The LC and ALC levels in the ineﬀective-treatment group were not signiﬁcantlyincreasedaftertreatment(detailedresults areshown inTable3). DISCUSSION LC is a non-essential amino acid derived from the essential aminoacidslysineandmethionine,whosebalanceismaintain ed through dietary intake and endogenous formation followed by renal excretion ( 29).In the brain, LC and its derivative ALC are present in high concentration, reducing nerve damagebyregulatingmitochondrialpermeabilityandprevent ing excitatory toxicity ( 34).LC and ALC may play antidepressant roles by improving brain energy metabolism ( 35), regulating neurotransmitters ( 36,37), and neural plasticity ( 38–40).
In agreement with the results obtained using a depression rodent modelandclinicalMDDsamplesstudiedbyNascaetal.( 27),the ALClevelinpatientswithMDDwassigniﬁcantlylowerthanthat of the age- and gender-matched HC group. Similarly, consistent withtheirﬁndings,wealsofoundanegativecorrelationbet ween ALClevel and HDRS-24 score.It is worth noting thata previous article reported positive correlation between peripheral and central nervous system ALC concentrations ( 14).Based on the ROC analysis, the serum ALC cut-oﬀ point of 1.835 µg/mL showeda88.8%sensitivityanda76.4%speciﬁcity,indicatin gthat serum ALC has a superior diagnostic value (AUC =0.898) in MDD.TheseresultssuggestthatALCmaybeadiagnosticmarker ofdepression.In contrast to the above-mentioned clinical study ( 27), we found that LC levels in MDD patients were signiﬁcantly lower than those in HC group.This diﬀerence may result from race, sample size, and eating habits.

Carnitine acetyltransferase catalyzes the syn thesis of ALC from acetyl-CoA (CoA) and LC on the inner membrane of mitochondria, and enters the mitochondrial matrix throu gh carnitine/acetylcarnitine acyltransferase. Carnitine pe netrates into the mitochondrial matrix, and carnitine acetyltransfe rase convertsALCintoLCandacetyl-CoA( 41).BecauseLCandALC are transformed into each other in the body, the LC and ALC contents were positively correlated (MDD: r=0.273,P=0.01, HC:r=0.293,P=0.005),manystudieshaveoﬃciallyconﬁrmed that LC and ALC have a synergistic eﬀect on the treatment of diseases( 42,43),andROCanalysisshowedthatAUCofpatients withMDDandHCwas0.891whenLCandALCwereconsidered together.LC and ALC may therefore be considered potential biomarkers of depression simultaneously.In order to avoid t he eﬀect of the drug on the baseline carnitine content, the patien ts enrolledinthegroupwereallpatientswithﬁrst-onsetdepres sion who had not undergone drug treatment.
Further studies are needed to assess whether reduced LC and ALC levels in MDD patientsaresensitivetounhealthylifestylechoicessucha slackof exercise,poordiet,smoking,drugsandlackofsleep.Many clinical studies ( 44,45) have conﬁrmed that, compared with established antidepressants, ALC can signiﬁcantly redu ce depressive symptoms and have similar eﬀects. However, no studies have reported the changes of LC and ALC levels in patients after antidepressant treatment.To verify the corre lation betweenthelevelsofLCandALCandtheoutcomeofdepression, we compared the changes of LC and ALC in patients with depression before and after treatment.In the treatment grou p where the HDRS-24 score reduction rate was >50%, the content of LC and ALC increased signiﬁcantly after antidepressant treatment.The concentrations of LC and ALC in the ineﬀective treatment group did not change signiﬁcantly.
Perhaps due to the small sample size, we did not ﬁnd a diﬀerence in ALC and LC levels between the eﬀective and ineﬀective groups, but the changes in ALC and LC before and after treatment were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the two groups. These results indicate that LC and ALC levels are related to the occurrence and eﬃcacy of depression, but further studies are needed to prove it.We did not intervene in clinical drug treatment.Due to the large number of therapeutic drugs and the small sample size, we did not classify and describe the therapeutic drugs in detail, nor did we consider the impact of diﬀerent drugs on the level of carnitine after treatment.Nex t, we hope to further expand the sample size to compare the eﬀects of diﬀerent types of antidepressants on the LC and ALC concentrations in patients with depression and the eﬀects of diﬀerent baseline LC and ALC concentrations on the eﬃcacy ofantidepressants.
Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 5 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 671151 Nie et al. L-Carnitine Acetyl-L-Carnitine Biomarkers for Depressio n This study has several limitations.First, the study was a single-center study with a small sample size; the samples after treatment were not grouped in detail.Second, the eﬀects of diet, exercise, sleep, and other external factors on LC and AL C concentrationswerenotconsidered.Third,theeﬀectsofdiﬀe rent drugs on the LC and ALC concentrations after treatment were notconsidered.In conclusion, the detection of serum LC and ALC may prove to have clinical value in the diagnosis of MDD.Multicenter and longitudinal studies are clearly needed to validate the potential of LC and ALC as novel biomarkers forMDD.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be madeavailablebytheauthors,withoutunduereservation.
