Introduction Effective pain management is a critical objective in both anesthesia and perioperative care. Magnesium modulatespain by inhibiting the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor , impeding calcium entry into the cell.1,2Previous clinical trials have af ﬁrmed the ef ﬁcacy of magnesium sulfate in diminishing postoperative pain when juxtaposed with salinecontrol.1,3,4While using magnesium sulfate has demon- strated a reduction in postoperative opioid requirements, the optimal dosing regimen remains uncertain.3,4 Prior reviews exploring magnesium as an analgesic adjunct encompassed a spectrum of surgeries characterized by diverse anticipated postoperative pain severities.Thissystematic review focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate for perioperative analgesia in adults undergoing General Anesthesia (GA) for general abdominalsurgery and comparing it with an inert control.
The primaryobjective is to assess postoperative pain scores in the group administered magnesium sulfate compared to the control. Secondary outcomes encompass postoperative opioidconsumption, intraoperative complications, time to rescue analgesia, and postoperative side effects.Methods This systematic review and met a-analysis followed a prede- ﬁned protocol, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022326263), and adhered to PRISMA re porting Guidelines.5 Study selection We included Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) involving Intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate administration (bolus, infusion, or combination) for perioperative analgesia inadults undergoing general abdominal surgeries under General Anesthesia (GA).Exclusions comprised cohort stud- ies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, case reports, caseseries, abstracts, conference proceedings, studies not inEnglish, investigations with non-IV magnesium administra- tion, and those lacking a separate magnesium study arm.
Postoperative pain scores (Numerical Rating Scale −NRS) were assessed at early (within 6 hours) and late (up to 24 hours) time points. Side effects and complications related to magnesium sulfate, were recorded in the Operating Room(OR) and/or Postanesthetic Care Unit (PACU).Cumulative postoperative opioid consumption was converted to Mor- phine Milligram Equivalents (MME) and measured at earlyand late time points.Search strategy A comprehensive search across PubMed, Medline, Embase,Web of Science, and Cochrane databases used the NationalCenter for Biotechnology Information Medical Subject Head- ings (NCBI MeSH) descriptors [magnesium (mh) or magne-sium (tw) or magnesium sulfate (mh) or magnesium sulfate (tw) or magnesium sulphate (tw)] and [perioperative period (mh) or perioperative (tw) or intraoperative (tw) or intrao-perative period (mh) or postoperative (tw) or postoperative period (mh)].
Executed in January 2022, the detailed literature search strategy is in Supplementary Table S1 . T wo independent authors (YS and NK) scrutinized titles and abstracts, and full texts were assessed by two reviewers (YS and MN).Referen- ces in the included studies were manually searched.Trialswere evaluated for bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, graded as “high risk ”,“low risk ”,o r “unclear risk ”of bias.6,7 GRADE methodology assessed evidence.8 Data extraction A standardized protocol guided a data collection form for study characteristics, patient demographics, and intraoper- ative and postoperative data.Study characteristics wererecorded, including the author ’s name and publication year.Preoperative data, such as age, sex, and Body Mass Index (BMI), were documented.
Intraoperative and postoperativedata included the type of surgery, duration, doses, andmethods of administration of magnesium sulfate and the control, intraoperative complications (such as hypotension and bradycardia), postoperative pain scores (NumericalRating Scale −NRS), postoperative opioid consumption, time to rescue analgesia, and the incidence of postoperative adverse effects (hypotension, bradycardia, shivering, andPostoperative Nausea and Vomiting [PONV]). T wo investiga- tors (YS and YA) extracted data and compiled the results.Any discrepancies in data collection were solved by discus-sion and dialogue among the team members and by consult- ing the expert author (MN).Whenever data was missing, we made a concerted effort to contact the correspondingauthor via email.Our analysis exclusively incorporates stud-ies for which we received a response regarding missing data.YS, NK, and YA ensured data accuracy and completeness.
Outcome de ﬁnition Primary outcome: postoperative pain scores (Numerical Rating Scale −NRS) in magnesium sulfate vs. control groups.Secondary outcomes: postoperative opioid consumption, time to rescue analgesia, intraoperative complications(hypotension, bradycardia), and postoperative side effects (hypotension, bradycardia, shivering, PONV).Statistical analysis Continuous data were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) and compared as Mean Differences (MD) and95% Con ﬁdence Interval (95% CI); dichotomous data were 2Y .Avci, M.Rajarathinam, N.Kalsekar et al.presented as Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95% CI; p<0.05 was con- sidered signi ﬁcant.A random-effects model accommodated inter-study variation.Egger ’s test, Begg ’s test, fail-safe N- test, and funnel plot inspection assessed publication bias.
Statistical heterogeneity used the I2statistic and Chi-Square test (I2>50%, and p<0.05 indicated signi ﬁcant heterogene- ity).9Sensitivity and in ﬂuence analysis was conducted to explore and address heterogeneity by excluding outliers andrecalculating pooled estimates. Subgroup and meta-regres- sion analysis was performed to adjust for patient baselineand clinical characteristics to con ﬁrm the outcome of the pooled estimate.Review Manager Software (RevMan,V .5.4.1) and comprehensive metanalysis software version 3.0 were used to conduct the analysis.Results Our initial search identi ﬁed 2320 studies, which underwent screening by titles and abstracts, resulting in 248 studies for Figure 1 PRISMA ﬂow diagram (n, number).3Brazilian Journal of Anesthesiology 2024; 74(4): 844524 full-text eligibility review.
Ultimately, 31 studies with 1762 participants (800 patients in the MgSO 4group and 802 patients in the control group) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis ( Figure 1 ).10-40Participants in the included trials underwent various general abdominalsurgeries under General Anesthesia (GA) and received either magnesium sulfate or a control perioperatively. Supplemen- tary Table S2 summarizes the data on the baseline patient characteristics.The quality of the studies was assessed usingthe Cochrane risk of bias tool, revealing some risks of bias in at least one domain for all studies ( Figure 2 ).The GRADE evidence is summarized in Table 1 .The baseline characteristics were similar between the magnesium and control groups across all individual trials, with no notable variances in patient age (800 vs.802patients, 49.4 §12.2 vs.49.4 §12.9 years, p= 0.93), BMI (215 vs.218 patients, 28.9 §9.3 vs.28.8 §11.4 kg.m /C02, p= 0.57), or surgery duration (697 vs.
696 patients, 111 § 71.8 vs. 114 §70.7 minutes, p= 0.36).Fifty-four percent of patients underwent open surgical procedures, while 46% underwent laparoscopic surgeries.The mean magnesium sul-fate administered in the studies analyzed in our meta-analy-sis was 41.1 §14.6 mg.kg /C01(ranging from 3 to 50 mg.kg/C01).Sixty-six percent of these studies continued with continuous magnesium infusion following the initial loading dose.TheSystematic Review (SR) of the included studies is summa- rized in Supplementary Table S3 .
Early postoperative pain score T wenty-seven trials, consisting of 1525 patients, contributed to the analysis of early (up to 6 hours) postoperative painscores, indicating a signi ﬁcantly lower mean score in the magnesium group (n = 762, 3.1 §2.5) compared to the control group (n = 763, 4.1 §2.8) (MD = -1.04; 95% CI: -1.52, -0.55; p<0.0001; I 2= 94%) ( Figure 3 A).10-12 ,14-17 ,19- 31,33,34,36-40Publication bias was investigated using a funnel plot ( Figure 4 ), Begg ’s test ( p= 0.774), Egger ’s test (p= 0.646), and fail-safe N-test (1991) for each parameter , which was not signi ﬁcant ( Figure 4 ). The funnel plot identi- ﬁed six studies as the major outliers contributing to the het- erogeneity.
When these studies were excluded and the pooled estimate recalculated, the MD decreased from -1.02 to -0.56, 95%CI narrowed (-0.81, -0.30), and heterogeneitydecreased from 95% to 77% without impacting the ﬁnal inference of our result ( p<0.0001).Late postoperative pain score T wenty-three trials, consisting of 1297 patients, were included in the analysis of late (up to 24 hours) postopera- tive pain scores, revealing a signi ﬁcantly lower mean score in the magnesium group (n = 657, 2.3 §2.0) compared to the control group (n = 640, 2.9 §2.4) (MD = -0.41; 95% CI: -0.67, -0.14; p= 0.006; I2= 87%) ( Figure 3 B).10-12 ,14- 16,19,20,22,24-27 ,29-31 ,33,34,36-40No signi ﬁcant publication bias was observed ( Figure 4 ). The funnel plot identi ﬁed six stud- ies as the major outliers contributing to the heterogeneity.
When these studies were excluded and the pooled estimaterecalculated, the MD decreased from -0.42 to -0.41, the 95% CI narrowed (-0.53, -0.29), and heterogeneity decreased from 87% to 11% without impacting the ﬁnal inference of our result ( p<0.00001). The overall postoperative pain score data indicated MD = -0.72; 95% CI: -0.99, -0.44; p<0.00001; I 2= 93%.In ﬂuence analysis con ﬁrmed the robustness of the results.
Early cumulative postoperative opioid consumption Seventeen trials, consisting of 916 patients, contributed tothe analysis of early (up to 6 hours) postoperative opioidconsumption, demonstrating a signi ﬁcantly lower mean measurement in the magnesium group (n = 459, 9.7 §7.7 MME) compared to the control group (n = 457, 12.4 §8.4 MME) (MD = -2.75; 95% CI: -4.20, -1.29; p= 0.0002; I 2= 99%) (Figure 5 ).10-12 ,15,17-22 ,25,26,28,30,32,34,38 Late cumulative postoperative opioid consumption T wenty-one trials, consisting of 991 patients, were included in the analysis of late (up to 24 hours) postoperative opioid consumption, indicating a signi ﬁcantly lower mean score in the magnesium group (n = 496, 19.4 §12.4 MME) compared to the control group (n = 496, 27.0 §16.2 MME) (MD = -8.46; 95% CI: -15.06, -1.87; p= 0.01; I2= 100%) ( Figure 5 ).10-14 ,18- 20,22,24-27 ,30-32 ,35-39The overall postoperative opioid con- sumption data revealed MD = -5.81; 95% CI: -9.09, -2.52; p= 0.0005; I2= 100%.
Time to rescue analgesia Five trials with 268 patients contributed to the analysis of time to rescue analgesia, indicating signi ﬁcantly longer time Figure 2 Cochrane risk of bias assessment.

no) to assess their impact on out-comes. Although these variables slightly affected the mean difference, they did not substantially in ﬂuence the overall estimation of pain scores at 6 and 24 hours (refer to Supple- mentary Table S3 ).Additionally, we evaluated the stability of aggregated pain scores through in ﬂuence analyses by sys- tematically excluding each study from the dataset and recal-culating aggregated pain scores based on the remaining studies (see Supplementary Fig.4 A and 4B).Discussion Effective postoperative pain management is crucial as it correlates with adverse clinical outcomes and patient dis-satisfaction, potentially leading to chronic pain.41Our ﬁndings underscore the bene ﬁcial impact of perioperative magnesium sulfate on postoperative pain outcomes,encompassing pain scores, opioid consumption, and adverse effects such as postoperative shivering in adults undergoing General Anesthesia (GA) for general abdominalsurgery.
Notably, the time to the ﬁrst analgesic adminis- tration was prolonged in the magnesium group compared to the saline control. Importantly, no signi ﬁcant disparities were observed between the two groups concerning intrao- perative complications and postoperative side effects, including hypotension, bradycardia, shivering, and Postop-erative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV).This study is distinctive as it represents the ﬁrst system- atic review and meta-analysis consolidating evidence from randomized control trials that speci ﬁcally focus on the anal- gesic effects of magnesium sulfate for abdominal surgery.Previous systematic reviews have explored the relationship between magnesium and postoperative analgesia across var-ious surgical disciplines, including orthopedic and cardiac surgery, alongside abdominal surgeries.
1,3,42-44An earlier systematic review and meta-analysis on perioperative intra-venous magnesium sulfate administration for postoperativepain also demonstrated a reduction in postoperative opioid Figure 4 Funnel Plot for the association of early (6 h) and late (24 h) postoperative pain in patients belonging to the magne-sium versus the control group. No evidence for substantial publi- cation bias was found in Begg ’s or Egger ’s tests.According to classic fail-safe N, missing studies were required to bring the p-value to more than alpha, suggesting the absence of publication bias.SE(MD), Standard Error of Mean Difference.7Brazilian Journal of Anesthesiology 2024; 74(4): 844524 consumption compared to control groups, indicating lower postoperative pain.Interestingly, the mode of delivery (bolus, bolus administration, or infusion) did not signi ﬁcantly impact outcomes, and the total magnesium dose adminis-tered did not correlate with 24 hour postoperative morphine requirements.
Notably, a single bolus administration between 40 and 50 mg.kg /C01reduced postoperative mor- phine consumption.3This aligns with a randomizedcontrolled trial, which suggested that a higher intravenous magnesium dose (50 mg.kg/C01bolus + 30 mg.kg/C01.h/C01infu- sion compared to 30 mg.kg/C01+ 15 mg.kg/C01.h/C01) not only decreased postoperative pain scores but also effectivelymitigated pneumoperitoneum-related hemodynamic insta- bility during gastrointestinal laparoscopy. 45However , high- dose magnesium administration has been acknowledged tolead to more frequent bradycardia and hypotension likely.3 Figure 5 Meta-analysis of early (6 h) and late (24 h) postoperative opioid consumption in magnesium and control group patients undergoing surgery.The mean difference of each included study is plotted.Using the random effects model, a pooled estimate ofoverall mean difference (diamonds) and 95% Con ﬁdence Intervals (width of diamonds) summarizes the effect size.

also demonstrated that systemic magnesiumreduced postoperative pain and opioid consumption aftervarious surgical procedures under GA, with a reduction in postoperative shivering also noted. 42Another systematic review by Guo et al.in 2015 con ﬁrmed that magnesium administration during GA decreased analgesic consumption and postoperative pain scores without increasing adverse events.44It is worth noting that Lysakowski et al.in 2007 did not agree with the effectiveness of perioperative magne- sium on postoperative pain intensity and analgesic require- ments.1De Oliveira et al.suggested that this discrepancy could be attributed to the fewer subjects in their observedstudies, the inclusion of pediatric populations, and the allowance of various regional anesthesia methods.In con- trast, our study was limited to adults and only included thoseundergoing GA to reduce clinical heterogeneity.42 Kawakami et al.
conducted a systematic review on magnesium and postoperative shivering, including 64 trialsand 4303 patients. They also demonstrated that intravenous magnesium prevented postoperative shivering without resulting in increased adverse events.46The biological mechanism underlying this effect remains uncertain.Shiver- ing can persist despite efforts to avoid hypothermia and may occur even in normothermic conditions.The resultingincrease in oxygen demand, leading to heightened carbondioxide production, may induce myocardial ischemia.46As magnesium exerts a calcium inhibitory effect, causing cen- tral arteriolar vasodilation and inducing the production ofvasodilator prostaglandins, it possesses anticonvulsant prop- erties and may slightly lower the shivering threshold in patients.47,48 Magnesium sulfate could be an effective adjunct for peri- operative analgesia in adults undergoing GA for abdominal surgery.
However , our results are constrained by the avail-able evidence in published studies and may have happenedby chance. We sought to minimize heterogeneity by restrict- ing our inclusion criteria to general abdominal surgery pro- cedures performed under GA.Despite these constraints,there might still be variability in expected pain severities and pain scores across the studies, even within general surgi- cal procedures such as laparotomy versus laparoscopy.Het-erogeneity could stem from differences in baseline chronic pain and opioid tolerance within the patient population, variations in speci ﬁc surgical procedures, and diverse study designs across the included trials.
The varied dosing and administration protocols for magnesium sulfate across studies limit the ability to draw de ﬁnitive conclusions about the optimal regimen for analgesia in abdominal surgery.Future studies exploring the pharmacokinetics andpharmacodynamics of magnesium in more controlled tem- perature conditions to measure the impact on postoperativeanalgesia and shivering may offer valuable insights into its mechanism of action, aiding in identifying optimal dosing strategies for clinicians. Conclusion Theﬁndings of the present comprehensive analysis support magnesium sulphate ’se fﬁcacy in providing perioperative analgesia for adults undergoing general abdominal surgeryunder general anesthesia.The observed reductions in post- operative pain scores, decreased opioid consumption, lower incidence of shivering, and prolonged time to rescue analge-sia administration in the magnesium group highlight its potential as a valuable adjunct in pain management strate- gies.
The results suggest incorporating magnesium sulfateinto perioperative protocols may improve patient comfort and outcomes following surgery. Further research, including large-scale clinical trials, may be warranted to con ﬁrm these ﬁndings and elucidate the optimal dosing regimens and administration protocols for maximizing the analgesic bene- ﬁts of magnesium sulfate in this context.Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no con ﬂicts of interest.Funding None.Supplementary materials Supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi:10.1016/j.bjane.2024.844524 .References 1.Lysakowski C, Dumont L, Czarnetzki C, Tram /C18er MR.Magne- sium as an Adjuvant to Postoperative Analgesia: A System- atic Review of Randomized Trials.Anesth Analg.2007;104: 1532−9.2.Iseri LT , French JH.Magnesium: Nature ’s physiologic calcium blocker .Am Heart J.1984;108:188 −93.3.Albrecht E, Kirkham KR, Liu SS, Brull R.
