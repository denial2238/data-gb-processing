Cisplatin exerts its cytotoxic effects by platination of DNA, which damages the DNA template and induces cellular apoptosis. The dose limiting nephrotoxicity of cisplatin involves a reduction in renal bloodflow, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and renal tubular function [1].Although the exact mechanism of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) is not understood, various processes, including local inflamma- tion,oxidativestress,DNAdamage,andtubularepithelialcellapoptosis have been suggested [3,4].The incidence of CIN is 30–60% in pediatric cancer patients who receive cisplatin [5].Although intravenous hydration and diuresis with mannitolduringcisplatinadministrationcandecreaseCIN,randomized studies have failed to show any clear benefit from these supportive treatments [6].

The current study is designed to investigate prospectively whether Mg supplementation can reduce the incidence of CIN in children with cancer who are scheduled for treatment with cisplatin-containing che- motherapy in a randomized phase-2 setting. For the primary endpoint, CINwillbeevaluatedbytheincreaseinserumcreatinine.Furthermore, this study will use the values for serum cystatin-C, beta-2 microglobrin (B2M), L-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), neutrophil gelati- nase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and urinary N-acetyl-β- D-glucosami- nidase (NAG) to assess CIN in detail.In the proposed study, a single course of chemotherapy will be re- garded as one sample.Each patient will be randomly allocated to twoarms with different pattern of Mg supplementation.
Because a pediatric cancer patient usually undergoes 3–8 courses of chemotherapy, Mg supplementationwillbeadministeredalternatelywithchemotherapyin each patient to facilitate the recruitment of samples and to minimize selection bias between two the randomized groups. 2.Methods 2.1.Study design This study is an open, multicenter, phase-2, randomized trial aimed at determining whether Mg supplementation during cisplatin-con- taining chemotherapy reduces CIN.As described above, a single che- motherapy course will be regarded as one sample.Participants will be randomly allocated either to an arm in which Mg supplementation in even-numbered chemotherapy courses (arm AB) or to another arm inodd-numbered courses (arm BA), with a 1:1 allocation stratified by disease subtype (brain tumor or others) and institution (Fig.1).Ana- lysis objects will be reconstructed into two groups depending onwhetherthechemotherapycoursehasMgsupplementation(groupB)or not (group A).
The primary endpoint is the proportion of chemotherapy courses resulting in elevated serum creatinine equal to or exceeding 50% of the pretreatment value for each chemotherapy course. The four secondary endpoints are: (1) the proportion of chemotherapy courses resulting in renal dysfunction as gauged by serum cystatin-C, B2M, L-FABP, NGAL, and urinary NAG values; (2) a comparison of serum cystatin-C, B2M, L- FABP, NGAL, and urinary NAG kinetics during chemotherapy between the groups; (3) a comparison of serum Mg values as a surrogate for Mg sulfatepharmacokineticsbetweenthegroups;and(4)ananalysisofthe safety of Mg supplementation.2.2.Participants Subjects who fulfill all the inclusion criteria and none of the ex- clusion criteria which are described in Table 1will be enrolled.2.3.Interventions In this study, participants will be randomly allocated equally to two arms.As shown in Fig.
1, one arm will receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy without Mg in the first course, then start Mg supple- mentation in the second and subsequent, even-numbered courses (arm AB).Theotherarmwillreceivecisplatin-containingchemotherapywith Mg supplementation from the first course; thereafter, Mg will be ad- ministered only during the odd-numbered courses (arm BA). In group B, intravenous Mg sulfate will be administered con- comitantly with intravenous fluid 2,400–3,000ml/m 2/day.The Mg supplementation dosage will be 15 mEq/m2/day (allowance: 13.5–16.5) starting at least 12h prior to the initiation of the cisplatin infusion and continuing until at least 24h after termination of the in- fusion.In group A, Mg administration will be allowed in patients who present hypomagnesemia <1.5mg/dl only when cisplatin is not being administered.2.4.
Outcomes The primary endpoint will be calculated based on the serum crea- tinine value, and the secondary endpoints will be calculated based on the serum cystatin-C, B2M, L-FABP, NGAL, and urinary NAG values. The baseline of these parameters will be examined at least 12h before starting cisplatin in each group.In group B, Mg administration will be started after the base line samples are taken.The parameters will sub- sequently be measured at 48 (±24) hours, 7 (±2) days, 14 (±2) days, and 21 (±2) days after starting cisplatin administration.Fortheprimaryendpoint,thehighestserumcreatininevaluewillbe Fig.1.Recruitment and Randomization of Study Participants.Asinglechemotherapycoursewillbetreatedasonesample.Participantswillbe randomly assigned either to an arm with Mg supplementation in even-num- bered chemotherapy courses (arm AB) or to another arm with Mg supple-mentation in odd-numbered courses (arm BA) in a 1:1 allocation.

Statistical analysis 3.1. Sample size This randomized phase-2 study is not strictly confirmatory because a single chemotherapy course rather than a single participant will be regarded as one sample.To minimize the effect of this limitation, the sample size will be calculated conservatively to detect a difference of 5% between groups using alpha=0.05 (two-tailed).Assuming two scenarios in which the proportion of non-CIN patients in group A (Mg-) is 85 and 90%, respectively.The statistical power to determine the required sample size was calculated as shown in Table 3.In order to guarantee 80% power, we estimated that a minimum of 40 samples per group would be required (ideally, 60 samples).When the total number ofsamplesreaches40pergroup,theinvestigatorswillconsulttheDMC about terminating recruitment.3.2.
Data analysis Clinical and demographic factors, treatment details, and study outcomes will be described using standard statistical methods; fre- quencies and percentages will be used for categorical data; the mean and standard deviation or the median and range will be used for con- tinuous data.To compare the two groups, the chi-square testor Fisher'sexact test will be used for categorical data and the t-test or one-way ANOVAwillbeusedforcontinuousdata,asappropriate.Allanalysesofefficacy will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis for the ran- domized arm, regardless of the treatment actually received. 4.Discussion So-called “late adverse effects” of cancer therapy are becoming an increasingly serious problem in pediatric oncology because approxi- mately 80% of children with cancer are able to survive longer than 5 years [1].Chemotherapy at an early age can produce serious compli- cations resulting from repetitive, acute damage to developing organs.
The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) starts to increase at the gestational age of 34 weeks and continues to increase gradually until age 3 years when it reaches the absolute GFR (120ml/min/1.73m 2) [15]. Con- sidering the vulnerability of developing renal tissue, younger patientsmay be at greater risk of CIN.CINconsists of glomerularandrenal tubular damage,both of which canbecumulative.The formermaybereversible whencisplatin isused in a low dose regimen (less than 360mg/m 2in total) while the latter may persist years after the completion of chemotherapy [16].Because CIN is one of the typical late effects which may become fatal if ex- acerbated, an effective prophylactic treatment is worth pursuing [17].The exact mechanism of CIN is unknown.In an analogy to in- toxication by heavy metals, cisplatin can be seen as inducing renal tubular cell death by binding to proteins with an SH-base, resulting in increased intracellular lysosome enzyme secretion.
Pathologicalchanges are observed primarily in the proximal anddistal renal tubular epithelium and collecting ducts [1]. In a rat model, magnesium (Mg) supplementation showed a kidney-protective effect against CIN by regulating renal platinum accumulation via changes in cisplatin efflux transporter expression in tubular epithelial cells [7].The increased ef- flux of cisplatin did not reduce its cytotoxic effect either in vitro or in vivo.The efficacy of Mg supplementation has been demonstrated in several studies of adult patients.Willox et al.[11] reported that sup- plementation with 16 mEq Mg was effective in reducing renal tubular damage in 16 patients with testicular cancer who received a cisplatin- containing regimen (20mg/m 2i.v.for 5 days).Bodnar et al.
[8] re- vealed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study that 40mEq Mg supplementation had kidney-protective effects against CIN in 41patientswithepithelialovariancancerreceivingpaclitaxel(135mg/ m 2/24h) plus cisplatin (75mg/m2) every three weeks. All other adult studies also showed the efficacy of Mg supplementation for CIN[9,11,12].In terms of safety, high serum Mg levels can cause cardiac arrhythmia and respiratory depression.However, in adult studies, gradeIIIandIVadverseeventsresultingfromMgsupplementationhave never been reported.The current study aims to investigate the efficacy of Mg supple- mentation in preventing CIN in pediatric patients with cancer.The rationale for this study is based on our retrospective study, which strongly suggested a kidney-protective effect of Mg supplementation in children with cancer, and on the adult studies described above.
In pe- diatric oncological practice, Mg supplementation is often used to treat chemotherapy-induced hypomagnesemia and rarely causes adverse ef- fects such as hypermagnesemia. We retrospectively investigated two groups, one of which included chemotherapy courses containing cis- platinwithconcomitantMgsupplementation(Mg+group;92courses) and another which did not receive Mg supplementation (Mg- group; 66 courses).The incidence of CIN in the Mg + group was significantly lower than in the Mg- group 9.8% vs 22.7%, p = 0.025 [13].No Mg- related adverse event was observed.The rationale for the current pro- spective randomized study was based on these findings.Pediatric cancers are rare and heterogeneous.Thus, in view of the rarity of these diseases, we focused on acute nephrotoxicity and eval- uated it per individual course of chemotherapy, which was generallyTable 2 Definition of nephrotoxicity in terms of the various parameters.

With regard to this rule and the retrospective data described above, a course of single chemotherapywastreatedasonesampletofacilitatetherecruitmentof subjects. Randomization was based on the patients.Because each patient usuallyrepeatschemotherapythreetoeighttimes,Mgsupplementation is administered only alternately with chemotherapy per patient.Analysis objects will be reconstructed into two groups depending on whether or not the chemotherapy regimen included Mg supplementa- tion.Then, the two groups will be analyzed for comparison.Therefore, samples from a single patient will be allocated roughly into two equal groups.Thisprocedurewillallowusfurthertominimizebiassecondary tothecumulativetoxicityofcisplatinbecausethesumofthenumberof courses in each chemotherapy regimen will theoretically be similar between the analysis groups (A and B).In view of the heterogeneity of the disease, this procedure will minimize any possible selection bias.
The chief limitation of this study design is the subject pool. If the mean number of chemotherapy courses per patient is four, only 30 patients will be enrolled in the study for a maximum sample number of 120, which may be insufficient to verify the efficacy of Mg supple- mentationtherapyforpediatriccancer.However,thesamplenumberin this phase2 studyislikelyto haveenoughpower todetermine whether a phase 3 study using a larger population should be planned.The second limitation of this study is that it is not designed to detect the efficacy of Mg supplementation therapy in chronic nephrotoxicity.This pointwillbeexploredinapost-hocanalysisoflong-termfollow-updata using this study cohort, as well as possibly in a subsequent phase-3 study.Inaddition,datacollectedinthisstudyusingvariousbiomarkers, such as serum cystatin-C, B2M, L-FABP, NGAL, and urinary NAG, may provide information helpful in designing the phase-3 study using novel and more precise markers than serum creatinine.
Currently, approximately 80% of pediatric cancers can be cured. Minimizing toxicity and maximizing efficacy are therefore important therapeutic goals in the treatment of pediatric patients with cancer.Neutralizing the serious, dose-limiting toxicity of cisplatin, one of the best chemotherapeutic drugs currently available, will contribute not only to minimizing “late adverse effects”, but also to improving the intensity and efficacy of the currently used cisplatin-containing che- motherapy regimen.Funding The study is supported by the Clinical Research Fund of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, Japan.Conflicts of interest The authors do not have any competing interests to declare.Ethical approval The study has been approved by the institutional review board of the Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center, Nihon University School of Medicine, and Saitama Children's Medical Center.The study is registered with the UMIN-CTR (http://www.umin.ac.jp/icdr/index.
