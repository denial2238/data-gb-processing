Foodborne illness is a major public health issue in the United States; millions of persons become ill from contaminated food every year (1 ).Most cases are sporadic (i.e., not associated with a disease out- break) (2 ), and the responsible food(s) is often un- determined.Outbreaks provide an opportunity for public health agencies to determine shared expo- sures and the source of infection.Many food safety laws and regulations, industry practices, and con- sumer education efforts have been implemented to make foods safer.Nevertheless, evolving foodborne pathogens and changing consumption trends pro- vide continued opportunities for contamination and illness (3 –7).Within these changing conditions, novel outbreak-associated food vehicles (i.e., foods not implicated in prior outbreaks) can emerge.Iden- tifying these novel food vehicles provides an op- portunity to determine emerging sources of illness and to inform prevention policies.
To identify novel food vehicles reported during 2007–2016, we exam- ined data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Foodborne Disease Outbreak Sur- veillance System (FDOSS). Methods FDOSS is a passive surveillance system that collects reports of foodborne disease outbreaks from fed- eral, state, local, and territorial health departments in the United States.It is the primary source of data for outbreak-associated illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths; etiologic agents; implicated foods; con- tributing factors; and preparation and consumption settings.Foodborne outbreaks are nationally notifi - able and defi ned as ≥2 cases of a similar illness re- sulting from ingestion of the same food (8 ).When exposure occurs in 1 state, the outbreak is classifi ed as a single-state outbreak; when exposure occurs in ≥2 states, the outbreak is classifi ed as a multistate outbreak.
Foods or specifi c ingredients are identi- fi ed as sources by using epidemiologic, laboratory, traceback, and environmental assessment data. On the basis of this evidence, a sole food (e.g., apple) or a specifi c ingredient that is part of a complex food (e.g., beef in a sandwich) is reported as the source of an outbreak.A complex food is reported as the source when no specifi c ingredient is implicated.When an investigation does not identify a source, the food vehicle is reported as undetermined.CDC uses a hierarchical scheme to categorize reported foods (9 ,10).For simplicity and ease of interpreta- tion, for this analysis we collapsed some categories (e.g., seeded and row crop vegetables are reported generically as vegetables).Using FDOSS data from 1973–2016 (accessed December 11, 2017), we reviewed all 14,216 reportedNovel Outbreak-Associated Food Vehicles, United States Hilary K.Whitham, Preethi Sundararaman, Daniel Dewey-Mattia, Karunya Manikonda, Katherine E.

We compared foods implicated in outbreaks dur- ing 2007–2016 with those implicated in outbreaks dur- ing 1973–2006. We identifi ed 28 novel food vehicles, of which the most common types were fi sh, nuts, fruits, and vegetables; one third were imported.Compared with oth- er outbreaks, those associated with novel food vehicles were more likely to involve illnesses in multiple states and food recalls and were larger in terms of cases, hospi- talizations, and deaths.Two thirds of novel foods did not require cooking after purchase.Prevention eff orts target- ing novel foods cannot rely solely on consumer education but require industry preventive measures.Novel Outbreak-Associated Food Vehicles outbreaks with an implicated food or ingredient (henceforth, collectively referred to as food).We compared reported foods from outbreaks with a year of first illness onset during 2007–2016 with those during 1973–2006 by using a 3-stage process to identify novel outbreak-associated food vehicles.
First, foods that were reported identically in both time frames were identified and removed by using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., https://www. sas.com).Second, 2 independent reviewers manu- ally compared the remaining 878 food items and flagged any foods that seemed to be novel in 2007– 2016.Third, a 5-member panel reviewed all foods initially identified as novel.For the second and third steps, we excluded foods if they were reported in a prior outbreak by using a different term (e.g., rice, wild vs.wild rice), a more general term (e.g., ched- dar vs.white cheddar), or a different spelling or an abbreviation (e.g., brat vs.bratwurst) or if a specific contaminated ingredient(s) was not implicated for a newly reported complex food.
We adopted this final exclusion criterion when reviewing complex foods in which no specific ingredient was implicated be- cause it could not be determined what ingredients were included in the food itself, much less which ingredient was actually contaminated and could be novel (i.e., direct comparison between 1973–2006 and 2007–2016 was impossible). We then conducted a secondary check of ad- ditional sources for all foods initially identified as novel (PubMed, online forums [e.g., Food Safety News, Food Poison Journal, and MarlerClark], and media reports).This check served to identify false-positive results from 2 scenarios: 1) the food had been implicated in an outbreak during 1973– 2006, but the outbreak had not been reported to FDOSS; or 2) the food had been reported as part of an outbreak occurring during 1973–2006 with a more generic term.
We reclassified foods only if the available information was sufficient to follow our criteria (i.e., there were >2 confirmed cases and an identified implicated food). Novel food vehicles are presented along with key outbreak characteristics, including etiology and vari- ous measures of burden (e.g., case counts, deaths) in addition to statistical comparisons of these character- istics for outbreaks associated with food vehicles that are novel or not novel.Specifically, we used nonpara- metric Wilcoxon tests to assess difference in means and χ2 tests to assess differences in percentages.Sta- tistical analyses were completed in R version 3.3.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, https:// www.r-project.org).Results Novel Food Vehicles By comparing outbreaks from 2007–2016 with those from 1973–2006, we identified 28 novel food vehicles (Table 1); the most common were fish (6), nuts (6), fruits (4), vegetables (3), and meats (3).
Two thirds of novel foods did not require cooking after they were purchased (e.g., blueberries, kale, various nuts), and half did not require refrigeration after purchase. Outbreaks Associated with Novel Food Vehicles A total of 36 outbreaks were linked to the 28 novel food vehicles during 2007–2016, and 7 foods were implicated in >1 outbreak (bison meat, blueberries, hazelnuts, kale, papaya, pepper, and pistachios).These 36 outbreaks resulted in 1,294 illnesses, 263 hospitalizations, 14 deaths, and 17 recalls.An aver- age of 3.6 (range 0–8) outbreaks associated with a novel food vehicle were reported each year.Among outbreaks linked to a novel food vehicle, 22 (61%) occurred in multiple states; the largest multistate outbreak resulted from ground pepper in salami, involving 45 states and 272 illnesses (11).Etiolo- gies included bacteria (27 [75%] outbreaks), toxins (5 [14%]), viruses (1 [3%]), and parasites (1 [3%]).
The most commonly reported etiologic agent was Salmonella (19 [53%] outbreaks), followed by Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (5 [14%]). Among outbreaks linked to novel food vehicles, 33% result- ed from foods imported from another country.Outbreaks associated with novel food vehicles differed from other outbreaks (i.e., those not associ - ated with a novel food vehicle) in several ways (Table 2).First, 61.1% of outbreaks associated with a novel food vehicle involved exposure in multiple states, compared with 5.7% of other outbreaks (p<0.001).Second, 48.6% of outbreaks associated with a novel food vehicle resulted in a food recall, compared with 5.2% of other outbreaks (p<0.001).Third, the mean numbers of reported primary cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were greater among outbreaks linked to novel food vehicles than among other outbreaks (p = 0.04, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively).
Fourth, the percentage of cases that resulted in hospitaliza- tion and the percentage of cases that resulted in death were significantly greater among outbreaks linked to novel food vehicles than among other outbreaks. Last, outbreaks associated with a novel food vehicle were more likely than other outbreaks to be caused by Sal- monella contamination (p<0.001).Two potential con- founding effects were a disproportionate number of Salmonella outbreaks linked to novel foods and Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol.27, No.10, October 2021 2555 SYNOPSIS 2556 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol.27, No.10, October 2021 Table 1.Novel food vehicles implicated in outbreaks that occurred during 2007 –2016, United States* Food Category State (no.states) Year of first illness Etiology No.illnesses No.hosp.No.

Compared with other outbreaks, those linked to novel foods were more likely to involve illnesses in multiple states; result in a food recall; and to be associated with, on average, larger numbers of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Investigating large and complex outbreaks requires consider- able government resources and major costs to the public and industry.Moreover, two thirds of novel outbreak-associated food vehicles did not require cooking after purchase, and roughly half of novel foods did not require refrigeration.These factors highlight the need for targeted industry efforts to reduce contamination before point of purchase to protect consumers.Food consumption patterns are dynamic, influ- enced by dietary trends, public health messaging, food accessibility, advertising, and affordability (6,7).Increased consumption of a food results in more opportunities for exposure and potentially larger outbreaks.
Importing of foods and bever- ages into the United States has increased; average annual growth in economic value from 2007–2017 was 5.9% (12). As a result, access has expanded to a broader range of foods from diverse areas.One third of outbreaks linked to novel foods resulted from imported foods, whereas the overall percent- age of outbreaks reported to CDC with an imported food implicated is relatively small (5% during the period 2009–2014) (13).Identifying novel outbreak-associated foods high- lights the need for improvements in public health.The 3 key areas are outbreak investigation, prevention, and communications.First, identifying the source of an outbreak can be difficult.Especially in multistate outbreaks, investi- gators typically use standardized food history ques- tionnaires to identify common foods among a sam- ple of patients.
Investigators develop questionnaires largely on the basis of trends in previous outbreaks and are influenced by common—rather than novel— food vehicles. However, identifying novel foods may require a detailed investigation of everything con- sumed by patients during the exposure period.A targeted questionnaire can be developed on the basis of data from these in-depth, hypothesis-generating interviews and administered to a larger group of pa- tients and controls.Barriers to this approach include limited resources, reluctance of investigators to allow investigators from other areas to interview patients in their jurisdiction, lack of training with regard to conducting hypothesis-generating interviews, and the assumption that more interviews with the stan- Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol.27, No.10, October 2021 2557 Page 1 of 1 Table 2.

This analysis included outbreaks resulting from a range of contributing factors, including contamination from ill food workers (and not resulting from more upstream processes). None of the outbreaks associated with a novel food vehicle were linked to an ill foo d worker.As a sensitivity analysis, 584 outbreaks lin ked to ill food workers were excluded from the comparison group, leaving 3,138 outbreaks.Among these, the median number of primary cases was 8.0 ; hospitalizations, percent of cases hospitalized, and deaths, and percent of cases resulting in death were all 0; 6.8% of outbreaks were multistate, 6.1% had a recall, and 31.6% had an etiology of Salmonella .All statistical results remained robust with p<0.05.†Nonparametric Wilcoxon testing was used to assess statistical difference in means.2 testing was used to assess statistical differences in percentages.‡Limited to single -etiology outbreaks that met confirmation guidelines.
Outbreaks associated with a novel food vehicle were more likely to be caused by Salmonella contamination. These outbreaks are more lik ely to result in large, multistate outbreaks leading to public health investigations.As a sensitivity analysis, we restricted the sample to outbreaks with an etiologic agent of Salmonella leaving 649 outbreaks (19 linked to novel food vehicles and 630 linked to other outbreaks).Case effects did not remain sig nificant (i.e., when comparing novel and other outbreaks , we found no statistically significant differences in primary cases, hospitalization, deaths, as well as percent of cases hospitalized and percent of cases resultin g in death).However, outbreaks ass ociated with a novel food were more likely than other outbreaks to have cases exposed in multiple states (84.2% for novel and 17.8% for other outbreaks, p<0.001) and result in a recall (63.2% for novel and 8.9% for other outbreaks, p<0.001).
SYNOPSIS dardized questionnaire will eventually reveal the underlying food vehicle(s). Efforts to further engage, fund, and support states in investigating and report- ing outbreaks are needed to effectively identify novel food vehicles.Second, identifying novel food vehicles provides opportunities for new prevention measures.The occurrence of >2 outbreaks linked to novel foods (we identified 7 instances) may serve as a warning signal for public health authorities indicating gaps in food safety practices, regulatory oversight, or both.Tar- geted outreach to industry may be pursued when a novel food is identified.Focused, collaborative pre- vention efforts undertaken by industry in collabora- tion with academic institutions, regulatory agencies, consumer advocacy groups, and other nonprofit pub- lic health organizations have been successful in the past and should become standard practice.
Third, communications regarding novel food vehicles to the public, industry, and regulatory agencies could be improved. Intensive public health messaging may be needed to notify the pub- lic, industry, and public health partners of newly discovered risks to prevent additional illnesses.This type of communication is regularly performed by public health and regulatory agencies, but great- er emphasis on the novelty of the food source could attract additional media attention and, in turn, lead to greater awareness.The first limitation of our analysis is that it en- compasses reported outbreaks with data on impli- cated foods representing both a subset of foodborne outbreaks occurring in the United States and of out- breaks reported to FDOSS.As a result, these novel outbreak-associated food vehicles may not actually be novel; rather, previous outbreaks associated with these vehicles may not have been detected or report- ed.
The second limitation is that only a small percent- age of foodborne illnesses are linked to recognized outbreaks (outbreak-associated cases are estimated to range from 0.5% of laboratory-diagnosed Campylo - bacter cases to 19.0% of Shiga toxin–producing E. coli O157 cases) (2), and it is possible that outbreak-asso- ciated novel foods differ from those linked to spo- radic foodborne illnesses.The third limitation is the possibility that novel food vehicles were misclassi - fied.Considerable efforts were made to reduce false- positive identifications by searching for different spellings, alternative names, and shared ingredients, as well as by using a team of independent reviewers.We also checked secondary sources for foods identi- fied as novel from FDOSS data.This effort identified 2 food vehicles (mamey fruit and jalapeño peppers) that incorrectly initially seemed to be novel because of the use of more generic food terms in reports be- fore 2007.
In summary, identifying novel food vehicles for foodborne illness provides opportunities for early interventions that should not go unheeded. This analysis highlights the need for expanded food safe- ty measures to reduce opportunities for contamina- tion as foods are grown, harvested, and processed and to prevent illness from both novel and other food sources in the United States and abroad.Great- er investment in public health outbreak investigation capacity may increase and expedite identification of novel food vehicles, which is vital because novel foods may serve as signals for emerging threats.Acknowledgments We thank our local, state, and territorial health department colleagues who investigate and report foodborne outbreaks to FDOSS.Funding for FDOSS is provided by CDC.About the Author Dr.Whitham is an epidemiologist with the Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Disease, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC.
