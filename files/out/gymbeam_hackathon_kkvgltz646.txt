Iron deficiency is the most common nutrition deficiency disorder in pregnant women (3), which estimated from 25% to 80% in preterm birth (4) and caused appro ximately half of the anemia dur- ing pregnancy (5).
Scholl et al (6) found that the Abstract Background: To evaluate the independent and collective effects of maternal iron supplementation and dietary iron intake upon the risk of moderate preterm birth and its subtypes. Methods: In this birth cohort study, 1019 pregnant women with moderate preterm birth and 9160 women with term birth were recruited at Gansu Provincial Maternity and Child Care Hospital from 2010 -2012 in Chi- na.Unconditional logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate the association between maternal iron supplementation, dietary iron intake, and the risk of moderate preterm birth and its subtypes.Results: Compared with non-users, iron supplement users exerted a protective effect upon the overall (OR=0.54, 95%CI =0.40-0.72) and spontaneous moderate preterm birth ( OR=0.39, 95%CI =0.33-0.83).
Com- pared with the 25th quartiles of dietary iron intake, either before or during pregnancy, it exerted a signiﬁcantly protective effect upon those who had the highest quar tiles of dietary iron intake ( OR=0.87, 95%CI=0.82 -0.95 for the highest quartiles of dietary iron intake before pregnancy OR=0.85, 95%CI=0.79 -0.91). Positive associa- tion was observed between the additive scale and multiplicative scale for preterm birth , spontaneous preterm rather than medically indicated preterm.Conclusion: Iron supplements (60 mg/day) and high -iron intake (>25.86 mg/day before pregnancy, >30.46 mg/day during pregnancy) reduced the risk of moderate preterm birth.Positive correlation is found between the additive scale and multiplicative scale for preterm birth, spontaneous preterm birth.

According to the WHO recommendations, daily iron supplementa- tion with 30 -60 mg during pregnancy contributed to prevent the incidence of maternal anemia and preterm birth (8).However, previous studies yielded conflicting results on the doses and time of mat ernal iron supplementation and the risk of preterm birth.Supplement of iron intake for 28 -36 weeks exert- ed independent positive effect upon preterm birth (10), whereas the highest supplement of iron intake (37.8 to 41.5 mg/d) yielded a lower birth weight and shorter duration of gestation in South India pregnancy women (10).
Regular iron supplement with 60 mg had no significant differ- ence in the incidence of preterm birth (10, 11). Ethnicity distribution probably has different iron status before pregnancy a nd different dietary habits may contribute to the inconsistency among these results.Rarely studies about the potential collective ef- fects of iron supplementation and iron intake were reported in previous investigations.Conse- quently, we conducted a birth cohort to investi- gate the independent and collective effects of ma- ternal iron intake and iron supplement upon the risk of moderate preterm birth in northwestern China.Materials and Methods Study population A birth cohort study was carried out from 2010 to 2012 at Gansu Maternity and Child Care Hos- pital, which was the largest hospital in Lanzhou, China.The study population has been described in our previous studies (13-15).
A standardized and structured que stionnaire was distributed to participation for collecting demo- graphic factors, reproductive and medical history, smoking and alcohol consumption, occupational and residential history, physical activity and diet. Data on pregnancy -related complications and birth outcomes were extracted from medical rec- ords.A total of 14359 eligible women were ap- proached for participation, and 10542 (73.4%) women were interviewed in -person, with 10179 women having singleton live birth.Moderate Preterm birth Moderate prete rm is defined as babies born alive during 32 to 36 weeks of pregnancy according to the WHO proposals (16), which was further clas- sified as medically indicated preterm birth and spontaneous preterm birth (17).
A medically indi- cated preterm birth occurs when a placental, uter- ine, fetal, or maternal condition exists prompting the medical team to proceed with delivery after the risks and benefits of continuing pregnancy versus early delivery are weighed. Iron supplementation and dietary iron intake Informatio n of iron supplementation was collect- ed by preconception (12 months before pregnan- cy), the first trimester (1 -13 weeks), the second trimester (14 -27 weeks) and the third trimester (>27 weeks) respectively.Iron supplement users were defined as those who to ok iron supplements during preconception and /or pregnancy (the most pregnant women using iron sulfate as oral iron supplementation, and iron content of each element was 60 mg).Non -users were defined as those who never took iron supplements alone and /or iron-containing multivitamins during preconception and pregnancy.Dietary data was collected via a semi -quantitative food frequency questionnaire.
Daily dietary iron intake was esti- mated from the frequency of consumption and portion size of food items usin g Chinese Stand- ard Tables of Food Consumption (18) for each period. Statistical analysis Data comparisons in the selected characteristics between women with preterm and term birth were evaluated using Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test if necessary.Unconditional logistic re- gression was utilized to determine the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the Iran J Public Health, Vol.50, No.6, Jun 2021 , pp.1177 -1187 1179 Available at: http://ijph.tums.ac.ir association among iron supplement, dietary iron intake and the risk of premature birth (PB).Con- founding factors including maternal a ge, maternal employment during pregnancy, monthly house- hold income, maternal education level, parity, twin status, newborn gender, and family history of hypertension were adjusted in the uncondi- tional logistic regression models.
Iron supple- mentation was cl assified into two levels by the midpoint of using duration, and dietary iron in- take was categorized to quartiles, and dose - response relationship ( P for trend) was calculated based on those categorical levels. The collective association among iron supplemen ts, dietary iron intake and preterm birth were estimated by using the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) with 95% CIs.The RERI was calculated using an additive model.The additive model, assessed their influence on disease risk, was adopted to test the biological interaction relating risk factors (19, 20) .All statistical tests were two -sided.Anal- yses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Insti- tute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).Ethical approval The project was approved by the Human Investi- gation Committees at the Gansu Provincial Ma- ternity and Child Care Hospital as well as Yale University.
All participants signed the written in- formed consents for participation and the use of data in research. Results A total of 10179 women were eligible for the fi- nal analysis, and of whom 1108 were adminis- tered with iron supplementation and 1019 were diagnosed with moderate preterm birth.As illus- trated in Table 1, c ompared with iron supplemen- tation non -users, iron supplementation users were more likely to have a higher education level, be employed during pregnancy, pre -pregnancy BMI less than 24, gain more than 15 kg during pregnancy, be primipara and be preterm.Women who ha d higher dietary iron intake comparatively were more likely to be o lder than 25 yr of age, have higher than college education, gain > 3000 RMB monthly per capita, be employed during pregnancy, gain more than 15 kg during pregnan- cy, have abortion history, be primipara and not preterm.

Due to interac- tion be tween iron supplement and dietary iron intake , the relative protection on the incidence of preterm birth was 0.29 ( OR for RERI =0.29, 95%CI =0.07-0.51), and an identical association was observed for spontaneous preterm births (OR for RERI =0.30, 95%CI =0.04-0.57) Table 3: Associations between iron supplementation, iron intake and risk of moderate preterm birth and subtypes Iron intake Term Births (n=9160) Medically indicated preterm(n=338) Spontaneous pre- term(n=681) Cas- es ORa (95% CI ) Cases ORa (95% CI ) Iron supplement Nonusers 8109 318 1.00 644 1.00 Users 1051 20 0.72(0.43～1.18) 37 0.48(0.34～0.68) < 4 weeks 504 10 0.67(0.33～1.35) 17 0.43(0.26～0.71) ≥ 4 weeks 547 10 0.75(0.38～1.48) 20 0.52(0.33～0.83) P for trend 0.179 <0.001 During the second trimester user 332 6 0.91(0.39～2.11) 17 0.76(0.46～1.26) During the third trimester user 718 15 0.72(0.40～1.27) 21 0.39(0.24～0.61) Dietary iron intake(mg/day) Before pregnancy Q1 <15.68 2229 102 1.00 211 1.00 Q2 15.68 -19.94 2284 95 1.10(0.77～1.58) 172 0.91(0.72～1.15) Q3 19.94 -25.86 2299 81 0.98(0.81～1.18) 163 0.96(0.85～1.08) Q4 ≥25.86 2348 60 0.85(0.74～0.97) 135 0.90(0.83～0.98) P for trend 0.003 0.003 During pregnancy Q1 <18.97 2183 130 1.00 232 1.00 Q2 18.97 -23.95 2301 77 0.75(0.52～1.07) 167 0.84(0.66～1.06) Q3 23.95 -30.45 2316 70 0.85(0.71～1.03) 159 0.93(0.83～1.05) Q4 ≥30.46 2360 61 0.80(0.70～0.91) 123 0.87(0.80～0.94) P for trend <0.001 <0.001 a Adjusted for maternal age, employment, monthly income per capita, education level, smoking, pre -pregnancy BMI, weight gain during pregnancy, parity, preeclampsia, history of preterm, maternal diabetes, caesarean section, vitamin supplement, total energy i ntake, die- tary iron intake or iron supplement b Preterm premature rupture of membranes Shao et al.: Association between Iron Supplementation, Dietary Iron Intake … Available at: http://ijph.tums.ac.ir 1184 Table 4: Collective effect of iron supplementation and dietary iron intake on the risk of moderate preterm birth and subtypes Dietary iron in- take (mg/day) Iron supplementation non-users Iron supplementation users Multiplica- tive inter- action P for inter- action Case/cont rols Ora (95% CI) Case/cont rols Ora (95% CI) Moderate preterm birth (n=10179) <23.04 574/394 2 1.00 32/542 0.51(0.35～ 0.76) 0.53(0.35～ 0.81) 0.003 ≥23.04 388/416 7 0.89(0.83～ 0.96) 25/509 0.78(0.67～ 0.90) Additive interaction: RERI (95% CI) =0.29(0.07 ～0.51), AP (95% CI) =0.87(0.33 ～1.41), S (95% CI)=0.69(0.53 ～0.91) Medically indicated preterm (n=9498) <23.04 195/394 2 1.00 12/542 0.70(0.36～ 1.35) 0.57(0.26～ 1.25) 0.160 ≥23.04 123/416 7 0.84(0.73～ 0.97) 8/509 0.78(0.60～ 1.02) Additive interaction: RERI (95% CI) =0.27( -0.10～0.64), AP (95% CI) =0.86( -0.13～1.85), S (95% CI)=0.71(0.46 ～1.11) Spontaneous preterm (n=9841) <23.04 379/394 2 1.00 20/542 0.44(0.27～ 0.70) 0.52(0.32～ 0.86) 0.012 ≥23.04 265/416 7 0.91(0.83～ 0.99) 17/509 0.78(0.66～ 0.93) Additive interaction: RERI (95% CI) =0.30(0.04 ～0.57), AP (95% CI) =0.87(0.24 ～1.50), S (95% CI)=0.68(0.49 ～0.95) RERI: relative excess risk due to interaction AP: attributable proportion due to interaction S: the synergy index aAdjusted for maternal age, employment, monthly income per capita, education level, smok- ing, pre -pregnancy BMI, weight gain during pregnancy, parity, preeclampsia, history of pre- term, maternal diabetes, caesarean section, vitamin supplement, total energy intake Discussion In this cohort study, iron supplement ation at a dosage of 60 mg/day and iron intake at a dos e of >25.86 mg/d before pregnancy, >30.46 mg/d during pregnancy can reduce the risk of moderate preterm birth , which probably varies according to the subtypes of preterm birth.
Moreover, t he positive interactions between the additive scale and the multipli cative scale were observed for overall preterm and spontaneous preterm birth. The protective effect was documented for iron supplementation users ≥4 weeks .The risk of pre- term birth was decreased along with the duration of use of iron supplementation and the protective effect was increased in spontaneous preterm Iran J Public Health, Vol.50, No.6, Jun 2021 , pp.1177 -1187 1185 Available at: http://ijph.tums.ac.ir birth rather than in medically preterm birth.Ei- ther before or during pregnancy , higher level of dietary iron intake reduced the risk of overall moderate preterm birth with a significant dose response, similarly for spontaneous preterm birth.
In the collective effect , compared with iron supplementation non -users with adequate dietary iron intake, the iron -supplementation user s exert- ed an effort on decreasing the risk of overall pre- term birth and sp ontaneous preterm births, indi- cating that the estimated collective effect of iron supplementation and dietary iron intake was higher than the sum of the estimated effect of iron supplementation or dietary iron intake alone. Iron supplementation and dietary iron intake failed to prevent the risk of medically induced preterm birth indicating that this subtype of pre- term birth possess specific etiology instead of iron status.During pregnancy, maternal iron needs are in- creased because fetus and placenta requir e iron to maintain growth.In the third trimester, the ex- pansion of maternal blood volume needs more iron (21, 22) .The daily requirement for iron is ranged from 1 -1.5 mg/day, up to 5.0 mg/day in the second and third trimesters (23).
However, the nutrient intake during pregnancy may be in- adequate, and pregnant women might consume merely 85% of the recommended dietary allow- ance for energy and shortfall iron (24). Poor qual- ity diet, inadequate intake combined with in- creased nutrient requirement led to multipl e mi- cronutrient deficiencies (25).Previous studies confirmed that pregnancy women with the iron deficiency had a significantly higher risk of pre- term birth and a decreas ing risk with the duration of iron supplementation (21, 26, 27) .According to an Ameri can study (NHANES), pregnant women presented with an increasing prevalence of iron deficiency along with trimester (21).In our study, women, receiving persistent iron sup- plementation rather than those with iron supple- mentation before pregnancy or only using during the first and second trimesters, have a lower risk of preterm birth, indicating that the risk of pre-term birt h decreased along with the duration of iron supplementation.
Iron supplementation has been administered in a variety of doses and regimens (28). Haider BA et al (27) suggested 10 mg of iron supplementation daily reduced the 3% risk of low -birth weight.Prophylactic iron supplementation (30 mg) re- duced the risk of preterm birth (29).Sixty eight mg daily supplementation of iron from 17 gesta- tional weeks to 6 -week postpartum failed to de- crease the risk of preterm birth (30).The inci- dence of preterm birth was not decreased after administering 30 mg of ferrous sulfate from the enrollment to 28 weeks of gestation (31).The dose of iron supplementation remains debated, since the functional impairment when iron was inadequate and cytotoxicity when excessive (32).Women with high iron supplementation had a greater risk of haemoconcentration at partum (32).
In the current investigation, 60 mg of iron supplementation was chosen in accordance with WHO recommendations of the daily dose of oral iron supplementation, and a positive protective effect on moderate preterm birth was observed. However, whether other doses also had the same positive protective effect remain need further elucidated .Our findings extend previous research by investi- gating the collective effect of i ron supplementa- tion and dietary iron intake upon the incident of moderate preterm birth.We found that pregnant women with iron supplementation and adequate dietary iron intake had a lower risk of moderate preterm delivery than their counterparts with ei- ther treatment alone , indicating that the collective effect of the additive scale of iron supplementa- tion and dietary iron intake together is higher than the sum of the estimated effect of either iron supplementation or dietary iron intake alone.
Iron absorp tion is a complex physiological pro- cess depending upon physiological demand, iron content and bioavailability. The underlying mechanism of this interaction remains to be vali- dated by subsequent studies.There were several strengths and limitations to be acknowledged in our study.Detailed information Shao et al.: Association between Iron Supplementation, Dietary Iron Intake … Available at: http://ijph.tums.ac.ir 1186 on demographic data, medical history and life- style factors allowed us to adjust and control the confounding factors.The moderate preterm birth and subtypes were diagnosed based on the medi- cal records rather th an self -reports, which mini- mized the risk of potential disease misclassifica- tion.Due to the deficiency of serological parame- ters to evaluate the iron status, the iron status cannot be evaluated.T he underlying mechanism of the collective effect should be investigated.
Conclusion Iron supplementation and dietary iron intake were independently associated with a reduced risk of moderate preterm birth. Adequate dietary iron intake may interact with iron supplementation to further decrease the risk of moderate preterm birth.Therefore, we need the further preventive strategies to confirm the presence of synergy be- tween these two factors and to explore the un- derlying mechanisms.Ethical considerations Ethical issues (Including plagiarism, informed consent, misconduct, data fabrication and/or fal- sification, double publication and/or submission, redundancy, etc.) have been completely observed by the authors..Acknowledgements This study was funded and supported by Bi- osTime Maternal and Child Nutrition Health Re- search Projects of China CDC Maternal and Child Health Center (No.2018FYH007, 2019FYH002) and Gansu Provincial Health Re- search Projects (No.GSWSKY -2019-98) Conflict of interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.
