Chickens in the experimental group were treatedorally with vitamin A (dissolved in 0.1 mL soybean oil,at a dose of 8,000 IU per kg diet) daily. Birds in the con-trol group were orally administered 0.1 mL soybean oilwithout vitamin A until 21 d of age.On d 21 after birth,all chickens were infected with 0.1 mL of 10 6.550% median embryo infectious dose of a pathogenic IBV strain (CK/CH/LDL/091022) by intraocular and intra-nasal routes.The results demonstrated that oral vitaminA supplementation did not affect the clinical course ofdisease and growth performance of SPF chickens.How-ever, vitamin A supplementation increased the IBV-spe-ciﬁc IgG serum levels and decreased the viral load in some tissues of IBV-infected chickens.In addition, theresults demonstrated that vitamin A supplementation decreased the expression levels of most immune-relatedmolecules in some tissues of IBV-infected chickens.
Vita-min A supplementation decreased the mRNA expressionlevels of some avian b-defensins ( AvBD2, 3, 6, 7, 11 , and 13) and increased the expression levels of AvBD9 and AvBD12 in some tissues of IBV-infected chickens. Simi- larly, vitamin A supplementation decreased the mRNAexpression levels of some cytokines (interferon- g, inter- leukin-1 b[IL-1 b], and IL-6) and increased the mRNA expression levels of IL-2 in some tissues of IBV-infected chickens.Furthermore, vitamin A supplementationdecreased the mRNA expression levels of myeloid differ- entiation primary response protein 88, nuclear factor- kB p65, toll-like receptor 3, toll-like receptor 7, and CD4.In summary, the present study suggests that vitamin Asupplementation enhances the immune function of SPFchickens against IBV infection by inhibiting viral repli-cation, increasing the IBV-speci ﬁc antibody titer, and suppressing the excessive in ﬂammatory responses to IBV infection.

Infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV ) is a gamma coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, which has been identi ﬁed as the causative agent of infectious bronchitis as well as seriousacute viral respiratory and urogenital diseases in com- mercial chicken ﬂocks ( Kinde et al., 1991 ;Carstens, 2009;Jackwood and de Wit, 2013 ).Chickens of all ages are susceptible to IBV, but young chickens present more severe clinical signs than older ones ( Raj and Jones, 1997).After IBV infection, subsequent bacterial infec- tions often occur, resulting in high mortality rates ( Mat- thijs et al., 2003 ;Matthijs et al., 2009 ).
Therefore, IBV infection is considered to be the second most damagingpoultry disease worldwide ( De Wit and Cook, 2019 ). Because no effective drugs against IBV infection have been reported so far, vaccination is the most ef ﬁcient approach to prevent production losses ( Meeusen et al., 2007).However, due to antigenic differences between the vaccine virus and circulating IBV strains, current/C2112023 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.This is an open access article under the CCBY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/ 4.0/).Received January 5, 2023.Accepted April 3, 2023.1These authors contributed equally to this work.2Corresponding author: madeying@neau.edu.cnImmunology, Health and Disease 1 vaccines do not offer full protection ( Meeusen et al., 2007).Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify cost-effective strategies to enhance immune protectionof chickens against IBV infection.
The immune system plays a crucial role in the body ’s ability to ﬁght infection. Nutritional de ﬁcien- cies or excesses in ﬂuence various components of the immune system.It is acknowledged that an ade-quate nutritional status is crucial for the develop- ment, maintenance, and expression of the immune system.Vitamin A is a fat-soluble molecule that isstored in the liver.Studies in both animals andhuman have demonstrated that adequate vitamin Alevels are important for normal immune function bymodulating lymphopoiesis, cellular differentiation,growth, reproduction, vision, and hematopoiesis(Ross, 2012 ).Vitamin A has been found to not only promote proliferation of T-lymphocytes (through the increase of interleukin-2 [ IL-2 ] levels) but also pro- mote their differentiation, especially into regulatoryT cells ( Jørgensen et al., 2011 ;Jovic et al., 2020 ).
Vitamin A de ﬁciency impairs innate immunity by impeding the regeneration of mucosal barriers dam-aged by infection and by diminishing the functionof neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer cells (Stephensen, 2001 ). It has been indicated that vita- min A de ﬁciency enhances macrophage-mediated inﬂammation by increasing IL-12 and interferon- g (IFN- g) production but impairs the ability of mac- rophages to ingest and kill pathogens ( Stephensen, 2001).This latter de ﬁcit may lead to increased pathogen replication at sites of infection, resultingin increased pathology, in ﬂammation, and secondary immune responses ( N a u s se ta l .,1 9 8 5 ;Wiedermann et al., 1996 ).
There is evidence that vitamin A de ﬁ- ciency is associated with an increased risk of diar-rhea, an increased risk of progression to acquiredimmune de ﬁciency syndrome, decreased numbers of circulating CD4 +T-cells, an increased human immu- node ﬁencyvirus-1 viral load, and an increased risk of mortality ( Kennedy et al., 2000 ;Rich et al., 2000 ). Vitamin A is an important nutrient for poultry.A previous study demonstrated that vitamin A de ﬁ- ciency depresses the response to viral vaccines(Davis and Sell, 1989 ) or compromises the local immune defense of Eimeria acervulina -challenged chicken ( D a l l o u le ta l .,2 0 0 2 ).In vivo inoculation of vitamin A can modulate immune functions ofchicken embryos, suggesting that vaccines might induce immune responses in vivo ( Shojadoost et al., 2021).
These observations indicate that vitamin A plays a crucial in the host defense of chickens.Therefore, we hypothesized that vitamin A supple-mentation could enhance immune protection inIBV-infected SPF chicken. Our speci ﬁca i m sw e r et o determine whether high vi tamin A intake increases serum IgG levels and/or decreases viral loads in tis- sues of chickens, thus improving recovery from IBV infection.MATERIALS AND METHODS Ethics This study was conducted in accordance with the ani- mal welfare guidelines of the World Organization forAnimal Health.All animal protocols were approved bythe Agricultural Animal Care and Use Committee ofHeilongjiang Province, China.Birds, Vitamin A, and Virus Strain One-day-old, speci ﬁc pathogen-free ( SPF ) White Leghorn chickens were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Harbin,China).Vitamin A (retinol palmitate) was purchasedfrom Aladdin (Shanghai, China).
The pathogenic IBVstrain CK/CH/LDL/091022 ( Sun et al., 2011 ) was used in this study. The virus was propagated once in 9-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs, as described previ-ously ( Liu et al., 2013 ), to obtain titers of 10 6to 108per 0.1 mL (50% median embryo infectious dose [EID 50]).Before use, viruses isolated from the allantoic ﬂuids of inoculated eggs were identi ﬁed by negative-contrast electron microscopy, real-time PCR ( RT-PCR ), and DNA sequencing ( Liu et al., 2009 ).Experimental Design In order to determine the optimal dose of vitamin A, eighty 1-day-old SPF chickens were randomly dividedinto 4 groups ( n= 20 birds per group).Chickens were fed diets supplemented with various levels of vitamin A (0, 4,000, 8,000, and 12,000 IU per kg diet) until 21 d of age.On d 21 after birth, all chickens were infected withIBV by intraocular and intranasal routes.
At 2 dayspostinoculation ( dpi) and 5 dpi, 5 birds from each group were humanely euthanized, and the trachea, lungs, kid-ney, spleen, cecal tonsil, and bursa of Fabricius of eachbird were collected ( Xu et al., 2016 ), and the viral load in the tissue samples was determined using RT-PCR as described below (see part “Detection of IBV-speci ﬁc antibodies and viral load ”). The results showed that diets supplemented with 8,000 IU vitamin A per kg dietsigniﬁcantly decreased the viral load in tissues of IBV- infected chickens compared to the other vitamin Alevels.Forty 1-day-old SPF chickens were strati ﬁed by body weight to minimize the variability in bird weight, housed in separate isolators, and randomly divided into 2 groups ( n= 20 birds per group).All birds were fed the basal diet ( Table 1 ), which met the nutritional require- ments of the National Research Council ( NRC, 1994 ).The birds had free access to feed and water throughoutthe experimental period.
Based on the results above,chickens in the experimental group were treated orallywith vitamin A (dissolved in 0.1 mL soybean oil, at a dose of 8,000 IU per kg diet) daily (termed vitamin A2 ZHANG ET AL. group), and birds in the control group were orally administered the same volume of soybean oil withoutvitamin A until 21 d of age.The birds were weighed on d1 and 21, and feed consumption and mortality wererecorded on d 1 and 21.Viral Infection On d 21 after birth, all chickens were infected with 1£EID 50of IBV by intraocular and intranasal routes (106.5in 0.1 mL per chick).After inoculation, 10 birds from each group (vitamin A and control groups) werelabeled and monitored for clinical signs.Serum sampleswere collected from these labeled birds at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,and 24 dpi.
At 2 and 5 dpi, 5 birds from each group were humanely euthanized, and the trachea, lungs, kidney, spleen, cecal tonsil, and bursa of Fabricius of each birdwere collected ( Xu et al., 2016 ), rinsed in cold sterile saline, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at /C070°C until further use. The experiment was terminated at 24 dpi.Allsamples were stored at /C070°C until further analysis.Detection of IBV-Speci ﬁc Antibodies and Viral Load The IBV-speci ﬁc IgG serum levels were assayed in triplicate using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosor-bent assay kit (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook,MA) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions.Serum-to-positive ( S/P) ratios were calculated as described previously ( Liu et al., 2006 ).
IBV-speci ﬁc IgG serum levels were determined by measuring the optical density at 630 nm ( OD 630) according to the manufac- turer ’s instructions.RT-PCR analysis was conducted to detect IBV RNA in tissue samples as described previously ( Xu et al., 2015). The primers were designed based on the L gene sequence as reported previously ( Xu et al., 2015 ).The primer sequences were as follows: forward, 50-CTATCGCCAGGGAAATGTC-30; reverse, 50-GCGTCCTAGTGCTGTACCC-30.Total RNA was extracted from the collected samples using RNAiso Plus reagent (TaKaRa, Dalian, China).To evaluate RNA quality, OD 260and OD 280were deter- mined.The OD 260/OD 280ratios were between 1.8 and 2.0 (data not shown).RT-PCR was performed using aOne Step SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit II (TaKaRa,Dalian, China) following the manufacturer ’s instruc- tions.All processes were performed in triplicate underRNase-free conditions.
Detection of Host Innate Immune-Related Genes Using RT-PCR The mRNA expression levels of immune-related genes in the trachea, lung, kidney, spleen, cecal ton- sil, and bursa of Fabricius of chicks were quanti ﬁed by RT-PCR analysis. W e measured the mRNA expression levels of some avian b-defensin genes (AvBD1 −14), in ﬂammatory cytokines ( IL-1b, IL-2 , and IL-6), a Th1 type cytokine ( IFN- g), myeloid dif- ferentiation primary response protein 88 ( MyD88 ), nuclear factor- kBp 6 5( NF-kB p65 ), Toll-like recep- tors ( TLR3 and TLR7 ),CD4, CD8 , and the internal reference gene b-actin .The primers of these genes were based on previously reported target sequences(Xu et al., 2015 ).RT-PCR was performed using the One Step SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit II(TaKaRa, Dalian, China).Brie ﬂy, the assays were performed using 2 mL of total RNA in a 25- mLr e a c - tion volume on a LightCycler 480II RT-PCR system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to a previous study ( Xu et al., 2015 ).
The standard plasmids har- boring these genes were prepared as described previ-ously ( Li et al., 2015 ;Xu et al., 2015 ). Serial 10-fold dilutions of standard plasmids were prepared to pro-duce standard curves.The expression levels of thesegenes were calculated using standard samples.b-actin was selected as the internal reference for normaliza- tion.All processes were performed in triplicate under RNase-free conditions.Statistical Analysis The results are expressed as mean §standard error of the mean.Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ).The general linear models were generated in SPSS 19.0 statistical software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).P<0.05 was considered to be statistically signi ﬁcant.Table 1.Ingredients and nutrients content of the basal diet.

Several chicks in both groups showed slight sneezing at 2 dpi.At 5 dpi, clinical signs became obvious in most chicks, including depression, ruf ﬂed feathers, tracheal rales, frequent head shaking, mouth breathing, andcoughing.The clinical signs were reduced at 12 dpi andalmost completely disappeared at 14 dpi.Similar resultswere obtained by histopathological analysis.
The tra-cheal mucosa exhibited severe lesions at 5 dpi, and slightrecovery was observed from 9 dpi, with chicks showing areturn to normal histopathological features by 14 dpi. In general, vitamin A supplementation had little effect on the clinical signs and histopathological changes of IBV-infected birds.Effects of Oral Vitamin A Supplementation on IBV-Speci ﬁc IgG Serum Levels and Viral RNA Loads in IBV-Infected Chicks The serum levels of IBV-speci ﬁc IgG were measured, and speci ﬁc seropositivity was detected in chickens from 4 to 24 dpi.In the control group, the IgG level increased from 8 dpi, reached a peak at 12 dpi, and was main-tained until 24 dpi.In the vitamin A group, the IgG levelincreased from 8 dpi and continually increased thereaf-ter, reaching a peak at 24 dpi ( Figure 1 ).The IgG level was signi ﬁcantly higher at 16 to 24 dpi in the vitamin A group than in the control group ( P<0.05).
We recently observed that the onset of viral shedding via the oral and cloacal routes ranged from 2 to 5 dpi, as evi- denced by the detection of viral particles in tissues (data notpublished). Therefore, in the present study we used samplestaken at 2 and 5 dpi to study the host immune response.The viral loads in the trachea, lungs, kidney, spleen, cecal tonsil, and bursa of Fabricius are illustrated inFigure 2 .The virus was detected at 2 and 5 dpi in inves- tigated tissues of all the birds, with the viral copy num- bers recorded in the trachea of the control birds at 5 dpi being the highest.The viral copy numbers at 5 dpi in thetrachea, lungs, and spleen were signi ﬁcantly lower in the vitamin A group than in the control group ( P<0.05, Figure 2 ).Oral Vitamin A Supplementation Modulated mRNA Expression Levels of Host Immune-Related Genes in IBV-Infected Chickens AvBDs have been shown to play vital roles in the immune response of birds against viral pathogens.
ThemRNA expression levels of AvBD1 to14in the trachea, lungs, kidney, spleen, cecal tonsil, and bursa of Fabriciusof IBV-infected chickens were determined by RT-PCR(Figure 3 A−H). The mRNA levels of AvBD2, 3, 6, 7, 11, and 13were lower in the vitamin A group than in the control group at 2 or 5 dpi.Speci ﬁcally, the mRNA levels of AvBD2 in the spleen were lower at 2 and 5 dpi, the mRNA levels of AvBD3 in both kidney and spleen were lower at 2 dpi, the mRNA levels of AvBD6 in the bursa of Fabricius were lower at 5 dpi, the mRNA levelsofAvBD7 in the spleen were lower at 2 dpi, the mRNA levels of AvBD11 in the trachea, lungs, kidney, spleen, and cecal tonsil were lower at 5 dpi; and the mRNA lev- els of AvBD13 in the trachea, kidney, and spleen were lower at 2 dpi in the vitamin A group than in the controlgroup (all P<0.05 or P<0.01).
Interestingly, the mRNA levels of AvBD9 were signi ﬁcantly lower in all the tissues investigated at 2 dpi, while they were higherin most tissues (except for lung and kidney) at 5 dpi inthe vitamin A group compared with the control group(P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). The mRNA levels ofAvBD12 were signi ﬁcantly higher in the trachea, lungs, cecal tonsil, and bursa of Fabricius at 2 dpi, butlower in the trachea, lungs, and kidney at 5 dpi in thevitamin A group compared with the control group(P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively).Due to limited space, we just described above AvBDs which exhibitedsigniﬁcant differences between vitamin A and the con- trol groups.Cytokine gene expression data are illustrated in Figure 4 .The mRNA levels of IL-2 were generally higher, while IFN- g(Figure 4 A),IL-1b(Figure 4 B), and IL-6 (Figure 4 D) levels were lower in the vitamin AFigure 1.Effects of oral vitamin A supplementation on serum anti- body levels of IBV-infected chickens.
Serum samples were collected tomeasure IBV-speci ﬁc IgG serum levels in SPF chickens infected with the pathogenic IBV strain CK/CH/LDL/091022. IBV-speci ﬁc IgG serum levels were assayed in triplicate using a commercial ELISA kit.Ten chickens were tested in each group at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 dayspostinoculation (dpi).Dashes show the S/P ratios, calculated as described in the Materials and Methods section.Serum samples with S/ P ratios equal to or above the dashes were considered positive.Valuesare presented as mean §SEM.* P<0.05.The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 19.0 statistical software.4 ZHANG ET AL.group compared with the control group.We observed higher IL-2 levels ( Figure 4 C) in most tissues (except for the cecal tonsil) at 2 and 5 dpi in the vitamin A groupcompared with the control group ( P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively).
IFN- glevels were lower in the trachea, lungs, and kidney at 5 dpi, IL-1blevels were lower in most tissues (except for the lung) at 2 and 5 dpi, and IL-6 levels were lower only in the lungs at 5 dpi in the vitamin A group compared with the controlgroups ( P<0.05). Similar to the mRNA expression patterns of IFN- g, IL-1b, and IL-6, MyD88 was signi ﬁcantly downregu- lated in most tissues (except for the bursa of Fabricius)at 2 and 5 dpi ( Figure 5 A), while NF-kB p65 (Figure 5 B) was signi ﬁcantly downregulated only in the spleen at 2 dpi in the vitamin A group compared withthe control group ( P<0.05, respectively).TLR3 and TLR7 were detectable in all six tissues investigated in both the control group and the vita-min A group ( Figure 6 Aa n dB ) .TLR3 and TLR7 mRNA expression levels were lower only in the cecaltonsil at 5 dpi in the vitamin A group compared with the control group ( P<0.05).
We did not observe any signi ﬁcant differences in TLR3 andTLR7 expres- sion in the other tissues between the control and vita-min A groups. Consistent with these observations, CD4 levels were signiﬁcantly lower in the lung and cecal tonsil at 5 dpi in the vitamin A group ( P<0.05) compared with the con- trol group ( Figure 7 A).However, we did not observe any signi ﬁcant differences in CD8 expression in all tis- sues between the control and vitamin A groups(Figure 7 B).DISCUSSION The present study demonstrated that oral vitamin A supplementation had little in ﬂuence on the growth per- formance of 1- to 21-day-old SPF chickens.These ﬁnd- ings suggest that the basal dietary vitamin A content issufﬁcient for SPF chicken growth in disease-free condi- tions.In addition, vitamin A supplementation 3 wkbefore IBV challenge did not affect the clinical course ofdisease.
These results are consistent with the majority ofclinical trial results, which have shown no overall bene ﬁ- cial or negative effects of vitamin A supplementation on recovery from infection ( Kjolhede et al., 1995 ;Dowell et al., 1996 ;Fawzi et al., 1998 ;Cui et al., 2000 ). Vitamin A is a crucial mediator of the immune system.VitaminAd eﬁciency leads to increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral pathogens, while vitamin A supplementationcould alleviate the negative effects of certain infectiousdiseases ( Villamor and Fawzi, 2005 ;Vlasova et al., 2013 ; Kandasamy et al., 2014 ;de Medeiros et al., 2018 ).Although high levels of vitamin A supplementation alter the immune response signi ﬁcantly, in the present study, these alterations were not suf ﬁcient to elicit other impor- tant protective responses, so as to affect recovery frominfection.In contrast to the clinical signs, oral vitamin A supple- mentation increased the serum antibody levels.
Thepresent results indicate that oral vitamin A supplemen- tation modulates the antibody response to IBV infec- tion. This result is in agreement with most previousstudies, which showed that vitamin A enhances the anti-body titers in vitamin A-adequate animals when givenbefore a challenge ( Dresser, 1968 ;Cohen and Cohen, Figure 2.Effects of oral vitamin A supplementation on viral RNA loads in tissues of IBV-infected chickens.Viral RNA copy numbers in the tis- sues of SPF chickens were measured by RT-PCR at 2 and 5 dpi.The results are expressed as mean §SEM of 3 independent experiments with 3 repli- cates per experiment.* P<0.05.Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 19.0 statistical software.VA REGULATES IMMUNE RESPONSE TO IBV INFECTION 5 1973;Falchuk et al., 1977 ).
Similar ﬁndings were also reported in mice, where supplementation with b-caro- tene (previtamin A metabolite) during pregnancy and lactation increased IgA levels in the mammary glands during lactation ( Nishiyama et al., 2011 ). This ﬁnding is in agreement with a previous study in a porcine model,where oral vitamin A supplementation signi ﬁcantlyincreased speci ﬁc antibody (IgA) titers after porcine epi- demic diarrhea virus ( PEDV ) infection ( Langel et al., 2019).Although serum antibody titers are thought to have a role in clearance of virus from tissues during infection, the increase in antibody titers may not havebeen suf ﬁcient to affect virus clearance or neutralization in this study.Figure 3.Effects of oral vitamin A supplementation on the mRNA expression levels of avian b-defensins (AvBDs) in tissues of IBV-infected chickens.The cDNA copy numbers of AvBDs in the tissues of 5 SPF chickens from the vitamin A and control groups were measured by RT-PCR at 2 and 5 dpi.

The current results suggest that oral vitamin A supplementation may enhance immunity of chickens by inhibiting viral repli- cation post-IBV-infection, which may be ascribed to reg-ulation of the immune response to viral infection. It has Figure 4.Effects of oral vitamin A supplementation on the mRNA expression levels of cytokines in tissues of IBV-infected chickens.The cDNA copy numbers of cytokines in the tissues of 5 SPF chickens from the vitamin A and control groups were measured by RT-PCR at 2 and 5 dpi.(A) IFN- g, (B) IL-1 b, (C) IL-2, (D) and IL-6.Cytokine mRNA expression levels were normalized to b-actin .Fold change values of target genes were calculated as the ratio of their expression levels in the vitamin A group to those in the control group.The results are presented as the mean §SEM of 3 independent experiments with 3 replicates per experiment.* P<0.05.The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 19.0 statistical software.Figure 5.

The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 19.0 statistical software.VA REGULATES IMMUNE RESPONSE TO IBV INFECTION 7 been well documented that viral infection is associated with local and systemic in ﬂammation and increased pro- duction of innate and proin ﬂammatory cytokines, which are responsible for the enhanced clinical signs of diseases(Ma et al., 2011 ,2012;Li et al., 2015 ;Xu et al., 2016 ; Zhao et al., 2020 ;Wang et al., 2021 ). Therefore, protec- tion against viral-induced disease was associated with a delay in the production of proin ﬂammatory cytokines after viral infection in animals ( Annamalai et al., 2015 ; Langel et al., 2019 ).The current ﬁndings demonstrate that oral vitamin A decreased the expression of AvBD2, 3, 6, 7, 11, and 13 insome tissues of IBV-infected chickens.
In agreementwith our ﬁndings, a previous study showed that induc- tion of b-defensin-2, -3, and -4 by Pseudomonas aerugi- nosa in human keratinocytes is inhibited by retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin A ( Harder et al., 2004 ). To date, 14 AvBDs have been identi ﬁed in chickens, which are considered as key components of the host innateimmune response against pathogens.It has been shown Figure 6.Effects of oral vitamin A supplementation on the mRNA expression levels of Toll-like receptors ( TLR3 andTLR7 ) in tissues of IBV- infected chickens.The cDNA copy numbers of TLR3 andTLR7 in the tissues of 5 SPF chickens from the vitamin A and control groups were mea- sured by RT-PCR at 2 and 5 dpi.(A) TLR3 and (B) TLR7 .The mRNA expression levels of TLR3 andTLR7 were normalized to b-actin .Fold change values of target genes were calculated as the ratio of their expression levels in the vitamin A group to those in the control group.

that prestimulation with a pathogenic IBV strain (CK/ CH/LHLJ/04V) results in enhanced expression of sev- eral AvBDs in the tissues of SPF chicken ( Xu et al., 2015). Similar results were reported for other avian viruses ( Ma et al., 2011 ,2012;Li et al., 2015 ;Xu et al., 2016;Zhao et al., 2020 ).These results demonstrate that enhanced expression of AvBDs in response to viral infec-tion may be associated with viral pathogenesis.Thepresent results suggest that vitamin A prevents exces- sive activation of the in ﬂammatory and immune responses by reducing the excessive release of theseAvBDs and enhances immunity in chickens during IBVinfection.However, in contrast to the above downregu-lated AvBDs, both AvBD9 and AvBD12 were upregu-lated in the vitamin A group in this study.Whetherdifferent signaling pathways are involved in the regula-tion of the production of these AvBDs in chickens is still unknown.
The mechanisms through which vitamin A can in ﬂuence the expression of these AvBDs need to be further investigated. In addition to downregulating AvBD expression, the current study shows that oral vitamin A supplementa-tion decreases IFN- g,I L - 1 b, and IL-6 expression and increases IL-2 expression.Cytokines have been studied tounderstand the host immune response to a wide range of avian viruses, including IBV ( Rasoli et al., 2014 ;Guan et al., 2015 ;Xu et al., 2016 ;Zhao et al., 2020 ;Ma et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2021 ).In agreement with our ﬁndings, previous studies also demonstrated that vitamin A sup-plementation reduced in ﬂammatory cytokine levels in PEDV-infected gilts ( Langel et al., 2019 ) and in in ﬂu- enza A virus-infected mice ( Cui et al., 2000 ).Therefore, the present results revealed that vitamin A supplementa- tion has an immunity-enhancing effect through suppress- ing the production of in ﬂammatory cytokines after IBV challenge in chicken.
However, in contrast to the downre-gulation of IFN- g, IL-1 b,a n dI L - 6 ,I L - 2w a su p r e g u l a t e d in the vitamin A group. These results suggest that vari-ous signaling pathways are involved in the regulation ofthe production of these cytokines in chickens.The present results demonstrate that vitamin A sup- plementation decreases MyD88 and NF- kB p65 expres- sion in chickens after IBV infection.It has been reportedthat once the pathogen-associated molecular patternsare recognized by TLRs, MyD88-dependent and -inde-pendent intracellular pathways are triggered to activateNF-kB transcription factors and mitogen-activated pro- tein kinase and induce the expression of immune-relatedmolecules to defend against the invading pathogens (Akira and Takeda, 2004 ).
Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects have not beencompletely elucidated, our results suggest that the con-tribution of vitamin A in reducing MyD88 and NF- kB p65 expression is associated with decreasing expressionof these AvBDs and proin ﬂammatory cytokines in IBV- infected chickens. However, the detailed molecularmechanisms of these responses need to be further eluci- dated.Furthermore, considering both TLR3 and TLR7 are upregulated in chickens following IBV infection(Wang et al., 2006 ;Guo et al., 2008 ), we evaluated theexpression levels of TLR3 andTLR7 in tissues of chicken in this study.The TLR mRNA expression levels are con- sistent with the AvBDs and cytokines investigated, aswell as MyD88 andNF-kB p65 .The data demonstrated that vitamin A downregulates TLR3 andTLR7 , which may result in suppression of in ﬂammatory responses to IBV.
To better understand the regulatory network acti- vated by vitamin A, we evaluated the mRNA expression levels of CD4 andCD8 in tissues of IBV-infected chick- ens. Vitamin A supplementation decreased CD4 expres- sion in some tissues.It has been shown that IBVinfection results in the production of large numbers ofCD4 +cells and CD8+cells, leading to an excessive inﬂammatory response ( Seo and Collisson, 1998 ).The current ﬁndings suggest that the role of vitamin A in reducing CD4 expression is associated with a decreased inﬂammatory responses to IBV infection.In summary, in the present study, vitamin A supple- mentation did not alter the clinical outcome of IBVinfection in chickens.However, vitamin A supplementa-tion was shown to enhance immune defense in IBV-infected chickens.This effect was characterized byincreased serum IgG levels and decreased viral replica-tion in tissues of IBV-infected chicken.
These changes occurred in conjunction with a decreased in ﬂammatory response to IBV infection. These ﬁndings demonstrate that vitamin A plays a vital role in the regulation ofchicken −IBV interactions and innate immunity.These results highlight the importance of understanding thepotential effects of vitamin A on host immunity duringviral infection.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province Grant ( TD2021C001 ) and China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA ( CARS-40 ).DISCLOSURES The authors declare no con ﬂicts of interest.REFERENCES Akira, S., and K.Takeda.2004.Functions of toll-like receptors: les- sons from KO mice.C.R.Biol.327:581 –589.Annamalai, T., L.J.Saif, Z.Lu, and K.Jung.2015.Age-dependent variation in innate immune responses to porcine epidemic diarrheavirus infection in suckling versus weaned pigs.Vet.Immunol.Immunopathol.168:193 –202 .Carstens, E.2009.
