When compared to the control group, the use o f RGM significantly increased the water holding capacity (WHC) as the particle size i n c r e a s e d . A s f o r t h e change in color value, addition of RGM resulted in an increase in a and b values; as the quantity was increased and particle size decreased, the a and b values increased significantly.The smaller the particle size of RGM, the greate r was the radical scavenging activity.According to the results of the measurement of the vi scoelasticity of chicken breast sausage containing RGM, the G’ and G’’ values increased with increasing amounts of RGM and particle size.Neither the addition of RGM nor its a mount or particle size had any significant effect on gel formation temperature.The te xture profile analysis (TPA) experiment examined the average TPA measurements of each sample under different measurement conditions, and no significant difference b e t w e e n t h e R G M a n d control groups were observed.
In conclusion, when RGM is used i n chicken breast sausages, the WHC, antioxidant capacity, and viscoelastic prope rties are affected. RGM can possibly be utilized in high value-added processed meat pro ducts if its quantity and particle size are altered base d on product characteristics.Keywords red ginseng marc, chicken breast sausages, physiochemical and r heological properties Introduction Traditionally, 20%–30% of fat is added during the sausage-makin g process to enhance binding capacity, textur e, and taste.However, manufact urers have shifted to using low-calorie fat alternatives in an effort to reduce fat c ontent, while maintaining texture and convenience, to address the needs of health-conscio us consumers (Chin and Lee, 2002; Choe and Kim, 2019; J eong et al., 2010; Kwak et al., 2010).
Fat substitutes should not only be lower in calories than actua l fat, but should also share similar physical properties, such as lubricating quality, binding capability, and water holding capacity (WHC), as well as having similar volume and taste. Hydrophilic ARTICLE Physiochemical Properties of Chi cken Sausage with Red Ginseng M arc Powder 487 colloids and non-meat proteins derived from soybeans or milk ar e the most widely used substances as fat substitutes (Chin and Chung, 2002; Choi and Chin, 2002).In the manufacturing process, red ginseng product, which is one of the representative health functional foods, produces red ginseng marc (RGM), which cons titutes about 65% of the producti on (Chang et al., 2007).Although RGM is rich in nutrients, it is primarily used as animal feed or compost or is disposed b ecause of its high water content that makes it susceptible to deterioration caused by spoilage microorganisms (Cho et al., 2013; Jung et al ., 2015).
RGM contains large amounts of acidic polysaccharides and effect ive ingredients, such as ginsenoside, which allow for various biological activities, as well as a high level of dieta ry fiber; thus, it is believed to serve as a substitute for fat in meat products (Ha et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2002; Lee and Do, 2002; Park and Kim, 2006). Moreover, RGM, which has been hygienically collected, handled, processed, manufactured, or ma naged for the specific purpose of consumption, can be used as a food ingredient per the standards of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety; hence, it would be valuable for use as a food material (Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, 2017).
Research on the combination of RGM with processed foods has so far been limited to red ginseng wine, muffins, bread, sponge cake, yackwa, and sweetened RGM, and no studies have bee n conducted on processed meat products (Han et al., 2007; Jo and Kim, 2014; Jung et al., 2015; Kim and In, 2013; Pa rk et al., 2008; Zang et al., 2014). Therefore, this study aimed to examine the physiochemical and r heological properties of a sausage prepared by adding RGM, which contains useful components but is discarded, to inex pensive chicken breast to determine its suitability as a functional additive for processed meat products.
Materials and Methods Ingredients Frozen chicken breasts (CheonIkFood, Busan, Korea) and pork bac k fat (Shindon, Asan, Chungnam, Korea) were purchased and stored in a −21℃ freezer (IBK-500F, InfoBiotech, Dajeon, Ko rea), and the supplementary ingredients included spices (ISFI, Braine-l'Alleud, Belgium), salt (Shinan Sea Salt, Shinan , Jeonam, Korea), sugar (CJ Cheiljedang, Incheon, Korea), collagen casings (NDX Collagen Casing, Viscofan, Ceske Budejovi ce, Czech), and soy protein isolate (ESFood, Gunpo, Korea). Before the curing salt mixing process, salt and nitrate (ESFood) were mixed in a 1:1 ratio, and extra salt was added a s per the required proportion.Curing salt was prepared using thi s method in a proportion of 99.7% salt and 0.3% nitrite.
Preparation of red ginseng marc powder Chungbuk Ginseng Cooperative Association (Jeungpyeong, Korea) p rovided RGM, which was processed through hygienic treatment separately after the six-time water extraction, and w as then dried for 12 h using a 60℃ hot air dryer (ThermoStable SOF–W 155, Daihan Scientific, Wonju, Korea), pulverized in a bl ender (Variable Speed Blender LB10, Waring, Torrington, CT, USA), and used in sausage manufacturing at varying amounts and particle sizes. Preparation of chicken breast sausages with red ginseng marc po wder The mixing ratio for chicken breast sausage was modified and us ed based on the research of Kim and Lee (2019) and Shin (2021) (Table 1).Frozen chicken breasts and pork back fat were stored at 2℃ for 12 h and then ground in a meat chopper (MGB-32, Hankook Fujee Industries, Suwon, Korea) before they we re completely defrosted.A hole plate (Hankook Fujee Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.42, No.
3, 2022 488 Industries) with a diameter of 6 mm was used. The pre-processed samples were mixed and emulsified according to the mixing ratio, and the temperature of the dough was monitored fr equently throughout the process to avoid the temperature from exceeding 15℃; the dough w as filled in a collagen casing o f diameter 26 mm and then heated using a smokehouse (HSCO-10E3, Hyoshintech, Incheon, Korea) to reach 72℃ in the ce nter.Following the heating of the sausages, they were immediately cooled in ice water, and their surfaces were steril ized using grain alcohol (Korea Ethanol Suppplies Company, Siheung, Korea).The samples prepared were vacuum-packed and re frigerated at 4℃ before being used in the experiment.
U s i n g R G M - f r e e s a m p l e s a s a c o n t r o l g r o u p a n d b y r e f e r r i n g t o e xisting studies for the optimum amount and size of the powder particles, the powder samples of all powders that passed through the 25-mesh sieve (particle size≤710 μm) were labeled based on the amount added: the sample with added amount of 1.5% (w/w) as T1, and the sample with added amount of 3% (w/w) as T2. Based on the particle size, powder samples t hat passed through a 50-mesh sieve, after passing through the 25-mesh sieve (ChungGye Industria l MFG, Seoul, Korea), were ref erred to as P2 [particle size≤300 μm; 1.5% (w/w)], while those that did not pass through the 50-mesh sieve were referred to as P1 [300 μm≤particle s ize≤710 μm; 1.5% (w/w)].Crude moisture content Crude moisture content of samples (sausage) was measured using a hot air dryer (ThermoStable SOF–W 155, Daihan Scientific, Wonju, Korea) set at 110℃.
On a stainless-steel wei ghing plate (CY1226, Chunyangsa, Seoul, Korea) with a constant weight has been calculated, 3 g of ground sample was a ccurately placed, dried, and cooled in a dryer, and the constant weight was calculated according to the equation below: Crude moisture content (%) = [(a – b) / (b – c)] × 100 a: Mass of weighing plates and samples b: Mass when the constant weight is reached after drying c: Mass of a weighing plate pH 5 g of the samples (sausage) were placed in a sterile filter ba g (SF0500, Central Science Trade, Tokyo, Japan) with 20 mL of distilled water and homogenized in a stomacher (LS-400, Bnfk orea, Gimpo, Korea) for one minute.

In a 50 mL conical tube (SPL Life Sciences, Pocheon, Korea), 1 g of dried gauze and 5 g of sample (sausage) were placed, and the tube was heated in a water bath (WCB-22, Daihan Scientific) at 70℃ f or 30 min, followed by centrifugation (CF-10, Daihan Scientific) at 25℃ and 905.5×g for 10 min. Next, the weight of the centrifuge tube and gauze was measured without the sample, and the WHC was calculated according to the following e quation: WHC (%) = [a – (b – c) / a] × 100 a: Sample weight (g) b: Weight of centrifuges and gauze without sample after centrif ugation (g) c: Weight of empty centrifuges and gauze (g) 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activi ty DPPH radical-scavenging activity was measured using the Blois ( 1958).1 g of sample (sausage) was placed in a sterile filter bag with 10 mL of 70% (v/v) ethanol, homogenized for 90 s using a stomacher, and then centrifuged at 1,222.4×g using a centrifuge to serve as samples.
160 µL of the 0.2 mM DPPH sol ution (Reagent Chemicals, C omscience, Gwangju, Korea) was added to 40 µL of the sample, incubated at room temperature f o r 3 0 m i n , a n d a b s o r b a n c e w a s m e a s u r e d u s i n g a microplate reader (EPOCH2NS, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA) at a wavelength of 517 nm. Color evaluation A colorimeter (Chromameter CR-300, Minolta, Ramsey, NJ, USA) wa s used to measure the L*, a*, and b* values, and a Minolta calibration plate (No.18833087, Y=91.8, x=0.3136, y=0.3196) was used as the standard colorimetric plate.For samples (sausages), the inner cross sections were used for colo r measurement.The △E value was calculated according to the following equation: △E= ට(Lcontrol∗−Ltest ∗)ଶ+(acontrol∗−atest ∗)ଶ+(bcontrol ∗−btest ∗)ଶ Stress & temperature sweep test Stress sweep, frequency sweep, and temperature sweep tests were performed using a rheometer (AR1500EX, TA Instrument, New Castle, DW, USA).
In order to investigate the s ection where there was a flat-s haped straight line for G’, a stress sweep test was run at 0–20 Pa, 20℃, and 1 Hz, and the ex periments were conducted under 5 Pa. The range for the temperature sweep test of samples (dough state) was set between 25℃ and 75℃ to verify the gel formation point and values of G’ and G” (Chattong and Apichartsrangkoon, 2009).Rheological properties Approximately 2–3 g of sample (d ough state) was collected and s pread widely on the plate, with the height set to 1,550 μm Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.42, No.3, 2022 490 using a 40 mm parallel plate to be trimmed.The experiment was conducted by setting the gap to 1,500 μm and placing it on the solvent trap.Then, using the built-in program, the tempera ture was raised to 80℃ and cooled to 25℃, and the frequency sweep test of sample (sausage) w as performed at 0.01–10 Hz base d on Chattong and Apichartsrangkoonb’s studies.
Texture profile analysis The texture was measured using a Texture Analyzer (TA-XT plus, Stable Micro System, Godalming, UK). An aluminum cylinder probe with a diameter of 35 mm was used.Previous stud ies on sausage texture measurement and a preliminary experiment in which the sausage did not collapse were used as r eferences (Andrés et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2018; Lima et al., 2020; Shin and Choi, 2021; Zhu et al., 2017).The measurement conditi ons were set at a strain ratio of 20% and 30%, and a cross-head speed of 1, 2, and 5 mm/s.The experiment was repeated for at l east five times at a temperature of approximately 25℃ (Table 2) .The sample (sausage) was shaped into a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 26 mm and height of 20 mm using a Cork Borer (Changshin Science, Seoul, Kor ea) and Cutting Tool (Extended Cr aft Knife A/ECB, Stable Micro Systems, Godalming, UK), then the casing was removed and measured.
Among several texture para meters that can be derived from texture profile analysis (TPA) experiments, this experiment u sed hardness, adhesiveness, cohes iveness, chewiness, and springiness. Statistical analysis For all experiments, at least three replications were performed , and the SPSS software pack age (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, SPSS, Chicago, I L, USA) was used to verify the significance of the results.One-way ANOV A was used to test for significant differences among three or more groups.Af ter testing for homogeneity of variance, a post hoc test was performed using the Scheffe method for equal variances or the D unnett T3 method for non-equal variances.To identify significant differences between t he two groups, the t-test was used.

Furthermore, the results from previous studies on low-fat sausa ges containing curcumin extract and paprika powder as fat substitutes are similar to the results of this experiment, whic h supports the confirmation that both the amount and particle s ize of RGM did not significantly aff ect water content (Kim and Chin , 2018; Kim et al., 2007). T h e p H o f t h e R G M p o w d e r ( 1 0 % [ w / v ] s o l u t i o n ) w a s 5 .1 0 , w h i c h i s l o w e r t h a n t h e p H o f t h e c h i c k e n b r e a s t , s o t h e sausage containing RGM had a slightly lower pH value than the c ontrol, and there were no significant differences due to the difference in the added amount and particle size (Table 2).In the current study, the pH of cooked sausage ranged from 6.3 to 6.4, similar to the pH of sausage found in other studies (Table 2) (Choi and Chin, 2020; Kim et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2018).
A higher WHC means that less mo isture will evaporate during reh eating, making it easier for the item to maintain its shape; the WHC is directly related to juiciness, which refers to the a mount of liquid that is released when chewing meat (Moon, 2002). As discussed in this paper, WHC describes the ability of meat to retain moisture when physical deformations, including pressure, heating, grinding, and cutting, are applied , whereas water binding capacity (WBC) refers to the ability to absorb external moisture (Wierbicki and Deatherage, 1958).The WHC for the control group was 69.79%, and for T1 (1.5%) and T2 (3%), it was 72.35% and 74.23%, respectively; however, t here were no significant differences among them (Table 2).As the meat products are heated, the meat protein shrinks and m oisture effuses simultaneously, reducing its ability to hold water.In regard to this phenomenon, Zhuang et al.
(2018) repor ted that when gelation begins, during which an actomyosin agglomerate is formed, the moisture effused creates water chann els that interfere with meat protein aggregation, thus degrading meat quality. The addition of insoluble dietary fiber s would increase WHC at this stage, since their water- absorbing properties would remove moisture from the water chann els or would form polysaccharid e chains to create a porous matrix structure (Zhao et al., 2018).In this experiment, altho ugh no significant differences w ere observed, the WHC tended to increase as the amount of RGM increased, and there was a sig nificant difference in the WHC between control and sausages with a RGM of P1 particle size (300 μm≤particle size≤710 μm).T he WHC of P1 was 77.63%, and that of P2 (particle size≤300 μm) was 73.25%, indicating that when RGM of a P1 parti cle size was added, WHC increased (Table 2).According to Auffret et al.
(1994), fiber matrix damage and deformation i n the pore decay during pulveri zation might lead to different water holding capacities; for citrus fibers, the smaller the pa rticle size, the lower the capacity to hold water (Y e et al., 2 016). The findings of these studies ar e very similar to those of the present study.2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activi ty The antioxidant capacity of sausag es containing RGM was measure d using the DPPH radical scavenging assay.The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the sausage with 3% RGM was incr eased significantly compared to the control (p<0.05), which is believed to be due to the large amount of acidic polysacchar ides with antioxidant effects that are present in RGM (Table 2) .According to a study by Jung et al.
(2015), the DPPH radical sc avenging activity was higher than that of the control group when the RGM powder concentration was 3% but showed no signific ant difference; a significant difference began to appear at a concentration greater than 6%. The examination of the antioxidant capacity by difference in pa rticle size revealed that there were significant increases in the values of DPPH radical scavenging activity (p<0.05, Table 2 ) in samples containing small RGM particles (P2, particle size≤300 μm) as compared to samples containing large RGM partic les (P1, 300 μm≤particle size≤710 μm).Lee and Do Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.42, No.3, 2022 492 (2002) stated that the smaller than 3.35 mm the particle size o f RGM, the more effective the extraction of acidic polysaccharides contained within RGM, which corroborates the fi ndings of the present study.
Meanwhile, alcohol-extracted RGM has been shown to contain more acidic polysaccharides that have anti-cancer and immune activation capacity than water-extracted RGM that are us ed as experimental materials in this study (Chang et al., 2007; Kwak et al., 2003). Color value The value of lightness (L), the measure of sample brightness, w as significantly smaller (p<0.05) in the group containing RGM compared to the control group, but there was no significant difference according to the amount of RGM added (Table 3).Compared to the control group, the value a for redness and the value b for yellowness were significantly higher in the group containing RGM, and with increased addition of RGM, these values increased significantly (p<0.05, Table 3).
During the process of steaming and drying red ginseng at high temperat ures, enzymatic browning is known to occur in the early stage of steaming, followed by the M aillard reaction during the dryin g process, which determines th e color of red ginseng (Kim, 1973; Lee et al., 1995). Accordingly, it is believed that the c hromaticity of values a and b i ncreases when the amount of RGM is increased due to the creation of browning reaction products such as maltulosyl arginine, fructosyl arginine, and melanoidin polymer (Park et al., 2007).W h e n t h e p a r t i c l e s i z e o f R G M c h a n g e d , L v a l u e s d e c r e a s e d s i g n i ficantly with smaller particle sizes, whereas a and b values increased significantly with smaller particle sizes (Tab le 3).Kim (2011) reported that as the particle size decreases, the internal structure becomes tighter and keeps light from being r eflected, thereby reducing the brightness.
Meanwhile, chicken breasts are known to contain lower levels of myoglobin than oth er parts or meat, showing higher lightness values relative to pork and beef after and before heating (Jeon et al., 2014). In conclusion, within the scope of this experiment, the amount of RGM added and its particle size were found to affect the color of chicken breast sausage.Frequency sweep test The measurement of the viscoelasticity of samples (sausages wit h T1, T2, and P1, P2 of RGM) by setting the frequency range to 0.01–10 Hz yielded the G>G” form for all samples, sugg esting that the samples possess viscoelastic properties close to those of solids (Fig.1).Increasing the RGM amount increased the G and G” values, and as the frequency increased, the G and G” values also Table 3.

It also forms a branch-like shape that produces internal resistance and friction, increasin g the G and G” values (Zhuang et al., 2019). The RGM used in this experiment was believed to have played a role.The viscoelastic characteristics of the sample showed a curve, as illustrated in Fig.1, which is similar to that seen in several other studies, and this curve demonstrates a flat-shape d increase, indicating that the sample possesses the properties of a weak gel (Correa et al., 2018).It was confirmed that the larger the particle size (P1, 300 μm≤ particle size≤710 μm) of RGM, the higher the G’ and G” values.Regarding the reason why large particle sizes have high er G’ and G” values compared to smaller particle sizes, Sendra et al.(2010) noted that at the same volume, smaller particles have a greater total amount, and consequently more destructive effects on the matrix.
This study found that sausages with smal l-particle RGM showed similar viscoelasticity properties to the control group, which was consistent with the results of Moreira et al. (2010) in which flour dough with small-particle chestnut powder displayed similar rheological properties to the control group.Temperature sweep test The change in the G values of the sample (dough with T1, T2, an d P1, P2 of RGM) during the heating process is mainly due to the denaturation of the myofibrillar protein, which chan ges from a highly viscous to a highly elastic state as the temperature increases.The G′ value changes in temperatures bet ween 25℃–29℃ can result from hydrogen bonding and molecular interaction, and denaturation of myosin head, a muscl e contraction protein, is know n to occur in this temperature range.
In addition, at temperatures of 55℃–60℃, myosin tails de nature and aggregate, while at temperatures of 63℃–75℃, covalent or noncovalent bonds form a 3D network of the protein matrix (Bolger et al., 20 18; Liu et al., 2019). At temperatures 25℃–75℃, the values of G and G” of the samples containing RGM were higher than those of the control group.A higher amount of RGM contributed to higher G and G” va lues.The G slope for all samples dropped sharply at Fig.1.Frequency sweep test of chicken breast sausage with different a mounts (T1, T2) and particle sizes (P1, P2) of red ginseng marc powder.Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.42, No.3, 2022 494 around 25℃–31℃, then moderately declined near 32℃–53℃, and then abruptly increased from 53℃ upward (Fig.2).Many studies claim that the gelation point of meat exists where eith er the G value rebounds drastically or the phase angle (tan Φ) value dramatically decreases (Pe reira et al., 2016).
Accordingl y, in this study, the gel formation temperature of the samples was estimated to be approximately 53℃, and it was found that ad ding RGM did not significantly affect the gelation point. The varying particle size of the added RGM had no significant e ffect on changing the gelation point of the sausages, so each r e m a i ne d s i m i la r t o t he ot he r a t a p pr o xi m ate l y 53℃ ( F i g.2) .T h e study by Dogan et al.(2018) examined the rheological properties of hydrophilic colloids, guar gum, xanthan gum, and pectin with different particle sizes exposed at the same temperature and found that smaller particles had smaller G valu es.The results of Wang et al.(2015) also concluded that pork dough containing soybean curd powder of large particle size sho wed continuously higher G values than the control group when heated to 80℃, and these res ults are consistent with those in this study.
TPA under different measurement conditions TPA is a method for measuring mechanical properties that mimic the texture perceived by humans, and depending on the conditions of the measurement, both the measurement value and t he significant difference between the samples may change (Shin and Choi, 2020; Shin and Choi, 2021). The best measuremen t conditions for TPA were those consistent with the sensory evaluation.Accordingly, in the absence of a sensory ev aluation, six measurement conditions were established in reference to previous studies, and the experimental results are summarized in Table 4 (Lee et al., 2018; Shin and Choi, 2021; Uzlaşır et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018).A comparison of TPA results for sausages with varying amounts o f RGM showed no significant difference in hardness between the control, T1 (1%), and T2 (3%) at a cross-head speed of 1.0 mm/s and strain ratios of 20% and 30%.
However, different measurement conditions produced different types of si gnificant differences. In other words, the same type of significant difference occurred between samples (T1 and T2) at a strain ratio of 20% and cross-head speeds of 2.0 and 5.0 Fig.2.Temperature sweep test of chicken breast sausage with different amounts (T1, T2) and particle sizes (P1, P2) of red ginseng ma rc powder at 5 Pa shear stress and 1 Hz frequency, from 25 ℃ to 75 ℃.Physiochemical Properties of Chi cken Sausage with Red Ginseng M arc Powder 495 Table 4.

In the case of chewiness, there was no signific ant difference between the samples (T1 and T2) at a strain ratio 30% and a cross-head speed of 1.0 and 5.0 mm/s, and a str ain ratio 20% and cross-head speed 2.0 and 1.0 mm/s, but under the rest of the conditions , there was a significant diffe rence that appeared in a completely different type, as it did i n hardness. In other words, in situations where significant diffe rences occurred between samples, completely different types of significant differences occurred between samples as the measure ment conditions changed.Likewise, sausage samples with RGM varying in particle size sho wed significant differences of different types between samples depending on the measurement conditions.
Under the cond ition of a strain ratio of 30% and cross-head speeds of 2.0 and 5 mm/s, and a strain ratio of 20% and cross-head speeds of 1 and 2 mm/s, there was no significant difference between the control, P1 (300 μm≤particle size≤710 μm), and P2 (particle siz e≤300 μm) samples in both hardness and chewiness. In addition, in both cases of hardness and chewiness, a significan t difference of totally different types occurred between sample s under all measurement conditions, where a significant differenc e between samples also occurred.Since the measurement values and significant differences vary d epending on the measurement conditions, the mean and standard deviation of all measured samples were obtained and ar e illustrated in Fig.3.The TPA parameters of RGM-added sausages changed irregularly wh en the measurement conditions, that is, the cross-head speed, were different.In other words, Fig.3 (top), arranged a ccording to the strain ratio, showed a significant increase in Fig.3.

TPA, texture profile analysis.Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.42, No.3, 2022 498 hardness (r2=0.8884, p=0.005) and chewiness (r2=0.9805, p=0.000) when the strain ratio increased, but in Fig.3 (bottom) arranged according to the cross-head speed, no significant tend ency (increase or decrease) w as observed with increasing cross-head speed.Similarly, a study by Shin and Choi (2020) on texture measurement of tofu by TPA method also discovered that when strain ratio increases, hardness (r2=0.9908, p<0.06) and chewiness (r2=0.9986, p<0.02) tend to increase.
It has been found that the increase in hardness and chewiness caused by an i n c r e a s e i n s t r a i n r a t i o a t t h e s a m e c r o s s - h e a d s p e e d i s primarily due to the densification of the molecular structure w ith an increase in the strain ratio (Choi and Lee, 1998). Texture profile analysis (TPA) characteristics The TPA analysis results demonstr ated that both the measurement values and significant differences between samples varied depending on the measurement conditions.Therefore, to e xamine the average texture characteristics (tendency), the resulting values from the six m easurement conditions were compi led and presented as average mean values (Fig.4).The difference in the amount of RGM added led to an increase in the average hardness value of the sausage, while the average value of springiness and cohesiveness tended to decreas e, but there was no significant difference with the control (Fig.4.top).A study by Garcı ́a et al.
(2002) substituted fat with dietary fiber derived from grain and fruit in sausage and found that adding 1.5% did not significantly change the hardnes s of the sausage when compared to the control group, but adding 3.0%, significantly increased it. However, this is the r esult under specific measurement conditions, and it is judged that it may be different from th e average value result in this experiment.Fig.4.Mean values of texture parameters of chicken breast sausage wi th different amounts (top) and particle sizes (bottom) of red ginseng marc powder obtained fro m all TPA tests (different stra in ratio & cross-head speed).TPA, texture profile analysis.Physiochemical Properties of Chi cken Sausage with Red Ginseng M arc Powder 499 The change in texture caused by the difference in particle size of RGM resulted in an increase in the average value of cohesiveness due to particle size, but there was no significant difference (Fig.4.bottom).According to a study by Bae et al .
(2018), when sausages were manufactured by adding pork skin, th e larger the particle size of the pork skin, the harder it was to be distributed evenly in the emulsified sausage, which could increase the chewiness. Using a meatball containing rice bran (10%, w/w) with varying particle sizes as a fat substitute, Hua ng et al.(2005) demonstrated that when rice bran particle size decreased, meatballs tended to inc rease in hardness, viscosity, and chewiness, while springiness and cohesiveness did not differ significantly.Although the results of these experiments did not exhibit the same tendency as those in this experiment, if the TPA parameters are measured under specific measurement cond itions that show results similar to sensory evaluation, it is thought that the amount and particle size of RGM can affect the texture characteristics of chicken breast sausages.
Conclusion When RGM which contains useful components but is discarded was used for the sausage, there was no significant effect on the moisture content of sausages compared to the control within the experimental range, but a slight pH change was observed, and the WHC increased significan tly when the particle size was large (P1; 300 μm≤particle size≤710 μm). The change in color of sausage caused by RGM showed a decrease in the L value and an increase in a and b values, with a and b values increasing significantly even furt her as more RGM was added and its particle size became smaller.The DPPH radical scavenging activity was significantly higher in the RGM sample, and increased as the amount of RGM increased, and the particle size decreased.The measurement of viscoelasticity of chicken breast sausage made with found that with increasing amounts of RGM and increasing particle size, the values of G an d G″ increased.
According to the temperature sweep test performed to determine the gelation point, the sausage gelation temperature was 53℃, which was unaffected by the addition of RGM, the amount added, and the particle size. The TPA test r esults showed that the measurement values differed according to the change in the m easurement conditions, and diff erent types of significant differences were observed between the samples.Analysis of the TPA measurements of all samples av eraged under various measurement conditions showed irregular values of hardness and chewiness, especially as the c ross-head speed changed.The TPA measurements of each sample under various measurement conditions were averaged, and the results showed no signifi cant difference between the RGM-added group and the control.In conclusion, RGM as a functi onal additive affected the WHC, antioxidant capacity, and viscoelastic properties of chicken breast sausages.
That is, wh en the RGM with a larger particle size (P1; 300 μm≤particle size≤710 μm) was added, the WHC of chicken breast sausage incre ased, and antioxidant capacity and viscoelasticity of chicken breast sausage increased as the amount of addition of R GM increased. However, as the RGM with a larger particle size (P1; 300 μm≤particle size≤710 μm) was added, the viscoelas ticity increased, but antioxidant capacity decreased.Therefore, it is believed that RGM, which is usually discarded, could be used as a new material in high-value-added upcycle meat processing products by adjusting the amount and particle s ize of RGM according to the product characteristics.Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no poten tial conflicts of interest.Author Contributions Conceptualization: Shin SH, Choi WS.Data curation: Shin SH, Ch oi WS.Formal analysis: Choi WS.Methodology: Shin Food Science of Animal Resources V ol.42, No.3, 2022 500 SH, Choi WS.Software: Shin SH, Choi WS.Validation: Choi WS.
