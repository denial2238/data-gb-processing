Abstract: Aminoglycoside antibiotics and gentamicin (GN), in particular, are still widely used in clinical practice.
It is a well-known fact that GN causes nephrotoxicity, and redox disturbances are discussed as a factor in its side effects. Recently, a new type of cell oxidative death, named ferroptosis, was discovered; it is associated with iron accumulation in the cell, glutathione (GSH) depletion and inactivation of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), reactive oxygen species (ROS) increment with concomitant lipid peroxidation.In this regard, a possible connection between GN-induced renal damage, ferroptosis and the overall antioxidant status of the organism could be investigated.More- over, due to its beneﬁcial effects, GN is still one of the main choices as a therapeutic agent for several diseases, and the possible reduction of its side effects with the application of certain antioxidants will be of important clinical signiﬁcance.The study was conducted with adult male white mice divided into several groups (n = 6).GN nephrotoxicity was induced by the administration of GN 100–200 mg/kg i.p.
for 10 days. The control group received only saline.The other groups received either Vitamin E (400 mg/kg p.o.) or Silymarin (200 mg/kg p.o.) applied alone or together with GN for the same period.After the end of the study, the animals were sacriﬁced, and blood and tissue samples were taken for the assessment of biochemical parameters and antioxidant status, as well as routine and speciﬁc for GPX4 histochemistry examination.The experimental results indicate that GN-induced nephrotoxicity negatively modulates GPX4 activity and is associated with increased production of ROS and lipid peroxidation.The groups treated with antioxidants demonstrated preserved antioxidant status and better GPX4 activity.In conclusion, the inhibition of ROS production and especially the suppression of ferroptosis, could be of clinical potential and can be applied as a means of reducing the toxic effects of GN application.Keywords: ferroptosis; GPX4; ROS; lipid peroxidation; gentamicin 1.
Introduction Ferroptosis is a type of cell death formally introduced as a concept in 2012 that is associated with cellular iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation [ 1]. The pathways by which ferroptosis leads to cell destruction are different than those that induce apopto- sis.In ferroptosis, the leading mechanism is the inactivation of Glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), increased redox potential, ROS accumulation and subsequent lipid peroxidation, Pharmaceuticals 2023 ,16, 1365.https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16101365 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals Pharmaceuticals 2023 ,16, 1365 2 of 18 as well as oxidative cell death [ 2,3].Other signiﬁcant changes in ferroptosis are associ- ated with increased expression levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 [4], while NADPH-FSP1-CoQ10 pathway and GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1), a rate- limiting enzyme in the BH4 biosynthesis pathway, are important for the suppression of the ferroptosis as well [ 5,6].
Ferroptosis plays an important role in the pathophysiology of several disorders, such as tumor development, neurological diseases, vascular problems, and renal failure [2,7,8] . The signiﬁcant role of ferroptosis in studies of some models of kidney damage (like folic acid-induced damage) has been reported, and the inhibition of the process almost completely neutralized the pathological changes in the kidneys [ 9].In recent years, the mechanisms of ferroptosis, as well as the factors that affect it, are beginning to be revealed, but many research efforts are still needed to study this process well enough.Zheng and coworkers [ 10] showed that ferroptosis plays an important role in neomycin-induced ototoxicity.It is a well-known fact that in addition to ototoxicity, the aminoglycoside antibiotics cause nephrotoxicity as well.Therefore, it is of great interest to study the relationship between aminoglycoside (and gentamicin in particular)-induced renal damage and ferroptosis.
Moreover, due to its beneﬁcial effects, gentamicin (GN) is still one of the main choices as a therapeutic agent for several infections, and the possible reduction of its side effects by the application of certain compounds will be of important clinical signiﬁcance [ 11]. In addition to the newly synthesized speciﬁc inhibitors of ferroptosis, the so-called ferrostatins such as Ferrostatin-1, Liproxstatin-1, and SRS 16-86 exist, and natural ones include Vitamin E [12].The search for other natural antioxidants with potential ferrostatic effects like silymarin (SM)—a bioactive extract from the plant Silybum marianum L.that contains ﬂavonolignans like silybinin [ 13], will expand their clinical potential for ferroptosis-related known disorders.The potent antioxidant [ 14] and hepatoprotective effects [ 15] of silymarin, as well as its nephroprotective properties the extract [ 16,17], are well known.
In the present study, we aimed to investigate the in vivo protective properties of vitamin E and SM against GN-induced nephrotoxicity and their relevance to accompanying oxidative changes. Our hypothesis is that ferrostatins have clinical potential and can be applied as a means of reducing the toxic effects of aminoglycoside treatment.2.Results 2.1.Physiological and Biochemical Status At the end of the experimental period, the mice were sacriﬁced, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis.Table 1 shows the results of creatinine, urea, and electrolytes Na+and K+.Signiﬁcant changes were observed only in the level of blood urea and creatinine in the GN-treated group.The level of urea in the combined groups was lower than the GN-treated group, p< 0.05.Table 1.Biochemistry parameters: creatinine, urea, and electrolytes Na+and K+examined at the end of the experimental period were without signiﬁcant differences between all the groups (n = 6).

In this context, nitroxide radicals are the most widely used contrast markers in ni troxide-enhanced EPR sp ectroscopy. X-band EPR spectroscopy, with the participation of ni troxides, occupies one of the most important places among spectroscopic techniques in the study of redox changes in cells, tissues, and organs [20].GN treatment induced high levels of free radicals, and as a result, the EPR signal intensity and the double-integrated area of the nitroxide spectrum decreased dramatically compared to the control (mean 19.7 ± 2.39 vs.80 ± 5.1, p < 0.05).The results show (Figure 9) that vitamin E and Silymarin show a protective e ﬀect on gentamicin-induced oxidative stress (Vit E + GN 56.7 ± 1.8 vs.19.7 ± 2.39 a.u., p < 0.05), and (SM + GN 69.8 ± 2.1 vs.19.7 ± 2.39 a.u., p < 0.05).Silymarin as a protector shows a higher potential e ﬀect compared to traditional antioxidant, Vitamin E.Figure 8.

Lower dosages (50 or 100 mg/kg) or shorter periods (5 or 7 days) are almost without histochemical and biochemical consequences. It has been reported that the nephrotoxicity induced by GN involves different pathways, including oxidative stress (OS), inﬂammation, nitric oxide (NO) generation, lipid peroxidation, and decreased efﬁciency of kidney antioxi- dant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels [ 21].This is in accordance with the results obtained in our study, which revealed that the GN-treated group had increased (OS) by depleting the activity of antioxidant enzymes and showing a drastic increase in ROS/RNS levels, leading to protein damage and increased levels of inﬂammatory cytokines.Oxidative imbalance induces damage to the structure of nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins and impairs the synthesis of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes [22].
Furthermore, due to the elevation of inﬂammatory cytokines, the oxidative home- ostasis in the nephrotoxicity-induced group was additionally disturbed [ 23]. Damaged proteins and lipids accumulated in stressed cells alter the structure and function of proteins and stimulate both NADPH-dependent and ascorbate-dependent lipid peroxidation with Pharmaceuticals 2023 ,16, 1365 11 of 18 co-factor ferrous ions (Fe3+) [22].Via the cytochrome P450 reductase system, Fe3+gener- ates•OH, thus increasing the MDA and ROS levels [ 24].Excessive ROS overproduction (especially in the context of ferroptosis and lipid damage) leads to membrane disruption and ion imbalances [ 25].The presented results in our study showed signiﬁcant changes in 8-OHdG in the GN-treated group, suggesting oxidative nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage [26].
The affected interleukins, together with the change in the expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and glutathione peroxidase) and increased Fe3+and ROS production, suggest GSH and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) depletion, which could be the connection between OS, mitochondrial damage and ferroptosis [ 25,27]. GSH is the most important antioxidant synthesized in cells and helps to remove peroxides and many xenobiotic compounds [ 28].In addition, GSH is a cofactor and substrate for glutaredoxins (Grx), which catalyze disulﬁde reductions in the presence of NADPH and glutathione reductase (GR).Protein and lipid damage is prevented by enzymes such as GR, multiple Grx and glutathione-S-transferases (GST).The fact that in the GN-treated group, the GST levels were almost twofold higher than the controls, but SOD and GSPx were three times less, is another sign of GSH depletion, nephrotoxicity, and the activation of ferroptosis.
Glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) are differentially expressed in cells and tissues and are involved in H 2O2detoxiﬁcation. GPX4 reduces the cytotoxic lipid peroxides (L-OOH) to the corresponding alcohols (L-OH), and its activity is the main pathway of ferroptosis [ 29].Different pathways for the inhibition or initiation of ferroptosis exist, but a central role in the process plays GSH and GPX4 bioavailability and activity [ 30].In our study, the relatively low change in the kidney expression of GPX4 in the GN-treated group and the control one supports the indirect inhibitory GPX4 mechanism for ferroptosis induction, which has been reported previously by some authors [ 31].However, an additional direct inhibition of GSH/GPX4, followed by a subsequent compensatory reaction of the antioxidant-protective body system, could be assumed, too.Such reactions might affect the nuclear factor erythroid 2 (Nrf2), which is an important regulator of the ferroptosis [ 32].
This suggestion corresponds with the results of Yue and coworkers [33] in the knockout Nrf2 rat model of nephrotoxicity. The recovery of the biomarkers of oxidative stress through the reduction of oxidation products of proteins and lipids (AEGs, PCC), stimulation of the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and suppression of ROS and RNS formation in the kidney and serum is evidence for the protective effect of vitamin E and SM against GN-induced nephrotoxicity.Moreover, the groups treated with these antioxidants showed protection from kidney inﬂammations, and the results were similar to the controls.Vitamin E possesses a strong protective effect as a lipophilic antioxidant and has the ability to inhibit the formation and propagation of oxidized lipids and suppress GSH depletion [ 29].Due to its role in the GSH/GPX4 axis, vitamin E is considered a potent natural ferrostatin.Many studies conﬁrm its protective role against OS and kidney injuries [ 34,35].
Together with other parameters of OS and inﬂammation that were very low in the vitamin E-treated group, the registered weak expression of GPX4 in the kidneys of these mice is probably a sign of a down-regulation of the enzyme due to the better oxidative status. This is in accordance with Sneddon et al.[ 32], who found that α-tocopherol (the most active form of vitamin E) reduced mRNA GXP4 levels without affecting its activity.In contrast to the vitamin E-treated group, the one with SM showed twofold higher levels of GPX4 in the serum.Such an increase might be because SM could prevent OS and eventually ferroptosis by several mechanisms, including direct scavenging of free radicals, chelating free Fe and Cu, inhibiting speciﬁc ROS-producing enzymes, improving mitochondrial integrity, activating Nrf2 pathway, inhibiting NF- κB pathways, activating heat shock proteins, etc.[ 14].
The obtained results demonstrated that natural ferrostatins like the powerful vitamin E, as well as the new potential active antioxidant SM, regulate the OS redox-homeostatic imbalance and the immunomodulatory response after GN-induced nephrotoxicity in experimental mouse models and beneﬁt the restoration of kidney func- tion. Gentamicin and the other aminoglycosides affect bacterial ribosomes, leading to the Pharmaceuticals 2023 ,16, 1365 12 of 18 formation of non-functional proteins, as well as ROS production, because of this protein disturbance [ 36].Since OS is part of the GN’s antibacterial activity, any antioxidant supple- mentation could affect GN’s effectiveness.However, GN-associated oto- and nephrotoxicity is mainly due to OS.In this regard, the beneﬁts of ferrostatins could be discussed when longer GN treatment is necessary, especially in polymorbid patients, where nephrotoxicity is associated with higher mortality [ 37].
In many aspects, the application of SM at a dose of 200 mg/kg p.o. showed similar or even better protection than the vitamin E administered at a dose of 400 mg/kg p.o.(IL-10, AEGs, SOD) in the combined groups.Additionally, to its protective antioxidant properties, in the GN + SM combined group, no inﬂamma- tory changes in the kidney were observed, and the degenerative process was diminished.The ability of SM to activate the SIRT1 pathway and to act as an indirect activator of the Nrf2 signaling pathway that is involved in mitochondrial function and survival has been proven in other studies [ 14,38].Furthermore, the administration of vitamin E and SM in combination with GN treatment restored the AEGs and especially PCC levels almost to the control levels.The protective effect of Vit E and SM against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in mice kidney tissue and serum was evaluated by pro- and anti-inﬂammatory mark- ers.
The GM-treated leads to an inﬂammatory reaction expressed in an increase in the pro-inﬂammatory markers IL-1 βand IL-6, while the anti-inﬂammatory IL-10 is statisti- cally signiﬁcantly decreased compared to the control and protected groups. The results showed that Vitamin E and Silymarin reduced gentamicin-induced toxicity in kidney tissue (Figure 7A–C) .The serum level of IL-10 was signiﬁcantly increased, while IL-6 and IL-1 β were decreased in the gentamicin group compared with the protected groups ( p< 0.05) (Figure 7D–F).In the GN-induced nephrotoxicity model, ROS/RNS generation resulted in progressive lipid peroxidation that had an impact on the reductive protein metabolism, increased collagen synthesis by increasing hydroxyproline, and directly affected the antioxidant defense system [25].The anti-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-10 increases antibody production as well [ 39,40].
IL-10 functions by inhibiting proinﬂammatory cytokines produced by macrophages and regulatory T cells, including IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. In the present study, vitamin E and even more SM, were shown to signiﬁcantly inhibit GN-induced levels of IL-1 β, IL-6 (Figure 7), TNF- α, and IFN-gamma (Figure 8) in mice and to increase IL-10 levels.Our ﬁndings correspond with those presented by Akbaribazm et al.[ 41], which demonstrated that herbal antioxidants have strong protective effects against gentamicin- induced nephrotoxicity and modulate anti-inﬂammatory markers in cases of renal diseases.Nitroxides are a class of piperidine (TEMPOL, TEMPO, Mito-TEMPO, etc.) and pyrrolidine free radicals (Carboxy-PROXYL, Carbamoyl-PROXYL, etc.) used in CW-EPR, SDSL-EPR and MRI techniques.They are redox-sensitive agents that can be reduced to the corresponding diamagnetic forms—hydroxylamines or oxoammonium cations by one- electron transfer reactions [ 42,43].
Like endogenous SOD, nitroxide radicals act as catalysts in the dismutation process of O 2•−to H 2O2and oxygen and can accumulate intracellularly at concentrations that effectively reduce superoxide anion radicals. The rate-determining step of this process is the oxidation of radical form to hydroxylamine.Studies have shown that the reverse process of oxoammonium cation reduction to O 2•−radical occurs at a higher rate than the corresponding SOD reaction [ 44,45].Piperidine nitroxides TEMPOL is a membrane-permeable nitroxide that has pronounced SOD mimetic activity [ 46,47].Experimental studies have shown that nitroxide ameliorates oxidative stress-mediated renal dysfunction and glomerular injury [ 48], ameliorates endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetic rats and reduces the infarct size of regional myocardial ischemia/reperfusion [ 49].Cyclic nitroxide radicals are deﬁned as suitable spin detectors for assessing the degree of oxidative stress in various pathologies.
Due to their ability to interact with free radicals, they are widely used in the development of many experimental models for monitoring OS global cellular redox status [ 50]. The results presented in Figure 9 summarize the experimental protocol aimed at studying changes in the TEMPOL EPR signal intensity Pharmaceuticals 2023 ,16, 1365 13 of 18 (a.u.) in mouse kidney tissue samples and comparing the obtained results with the intensity of the EPR spectrum in a pure TEMPOL/DMSO system (control sample, without tissue).4.Materials and Methods 4.1.Plant Material and Drugs Silymarin was collected from central Bulgaria at the end of 2022.All chemicals were analytical grade (AR > 99.7%).The used silymarin was donated by Prof.V Ivanov, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria [ 17].Vitamin E was purchased by Sigma Aldrich Pty Ltd., Merck KGaA, Soﬁa, Bulgaria.Gentamicin was purchased in the pharmacy forms.4.2.
Animals, Experimental Design, and Ethical Approval White male mice (n = 36) aged 6 weeks (mean weight 27–36 ±2.0 g) were purchased from the Institute of Animal Science, Slivnitsa, Bulgaria. After transport, the animals had a 10-day cycle of adaptive feeding and acclimatization.During the experiment, they had ad libitum access to fresh water and food, maintained 12 h/d light/dark cycles, 23 ±2◦C and humidity 55% in the vivarium of the Faculty of Medicine of Trakia University.The work procedures were approved by the Trakia University Animal Ethics Commission, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria, and the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency, Soﬁa, Bulgaria, with a license (325/6000-0333/09.12.2021) following Directive 2010/63/EU on the animals’ protection used for experimental and other scientiﬁc work.
The experimental animals were divided into six groups (n = 6) under controlled environmental conditions: (1) control group ( n = 6 ); (2) gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity group (n = 6) treated by GN for 10 consecutive days (200 mg/kg i.p.); (3) vitamin E group (n = 6) treated by vitamin E in a dose of 400 mg/kg p.o., given via a feeding needle for 10 consecutive days; (4) silymarin group (n = 6) treated by silymarin in a dose of 200 mg/kg p.o., given via a feeding needle for10 consecutive days; (5) vitamin E and GN group (n = 6) treated by vitamin E in a dose of 400 mg/kg p.o., given via a feeding needle for 10 consecutive days and GN for10 consecutive days ( 200 mg/kg i.p.) ; (6) silymarin and GN group (n = 6) treated by silymarin in a dose of 200 mg/kg p.o., given via a feeding needle for 10 consecutive days and GN for 10 consecutive days (200 mg/kg i.p.).
The used vitamin E and silymarin were mixed with d.H 2O and crude olive oil (Lekkas Farm, Mikro Horio, Greece) before treating the mice. The physiological state and behavior of the experimental animals were monitored daily.4.3.Dissection Procedure The animals were sacriﬁced under anesthesia (Nembutal 50 mg/kg i.p.) on day 11 from the beginning of the experiment.Blood samples were collected by intracardiac standard technique, and fresh blood was collected with vacutainer serum tubes.Serum samples were prepared by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 10 min, 4◦C).Kidney samples were stored in ice-cold PBS (4◦C), weighed (SW) and homogenized.4.4.Histological Analysis for Visualization of Kidney Changes The preparation of the kidney samples for histopathological examination included removal and perfusing of the right kidneys, followed by immersing the tissues in a ﬁxative 10% aqueous formalin solution for 24 h.
After dehydration in a graduated series of ethanolic concentrations, the blocks are clariﬁed in xylene and embedded in parafﬁn. The tissue 4µm-sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, dewaxed twice in xylene and rehy- drated by a series of decreasing ethanol concentrations.The histological evaluation was performed after staining the sections with a standard hematoxylin/eosin-based method (0.1% H&E) and speciﬁc staining with antibodies against GPX4 (Glutathione Peroxidase 4/GPX4 Antibody (E-12), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA).Pharmaceuticals 2023 ,16, 1365 14 of 18 4.5.Analysis of Hydroxyproline (Hyp) in Kidney Tissue The analysis for Hyp levels in the kidneys was used to measure tissue collagen content indirectly and to quantify the tissue damage by a Woessner method [ 51].
In brief, analysis of hydroxyproline levels in kidney tissue (drying at 110◦C for 24 h; hydrolysis with 6N HCl, incubation at 110◦C) was determined spectrophotometrically by 550 nm absorption, and the results are expressed as µg of hydroxyproline per gram used tissue. 4.6.Determination of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) The glutathione-S-transferase activity (GST) in kidney homogenates was determined using a 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene reagent [ 52].The chemical mixture included 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 8.2), 15 mM GSH, and 15 mM CDNB, which were added to a 10µL tissue homogenate sample.A control sample contained only a chemical reaction mixture without tissue homogenate.The enzyme production and, respectively, the activity of GST in each investigated sample were evaluated through the spectrophotometric sample investigation with absorption at 340 nm.4.7.
Protocol for Functional Markers Measurement of Kidney Damage For the evaluation of the functional kidney damage, clinical data were analyzed for creatine, urea and electrolytes. Creatinine and urea were measured with ELISA kits (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) by following the manufacturer’s instructions, and electrolytes were measured by an electrolytic panel.4.8.Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Study All EPR measurements were performed at room temperature on a Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany, equipped with a standard resonator.All EPR experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated thrice.Spectral processing was performed using Bruker WIN-EPR and Simfonia software, version 2015.4.8.1.Evaluation of the ROS Product Levels The levels of ROS were determined following Shi et al.[ 53] with some modiﬁcations.To investigate the ROS formation in the samples, ex vivo EPR spectroscopy was used combined with N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) as a spin-trapping agent.
Brieﬂy, to 100 µL plasma was added 900 µL 50 mM PBN dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and, after centrifugation at 4000 ×grpm for 10 min at 4◦C, the EPR spectra were im- mediately recorded in the supernatant. The levels of ROS products were calculated as double-integrated plots of EPR spectra, and results were expressed in arbitrary units (a.u.).The EPR settings were as follows: 3503.73 G center ﬁeld, 20.00 mW microwave power, 5 G modulation amplitude, 50 G sweep width, 1 ×105gain, 81.92 ms time constant, 125.95 s sweep time, and ﬁve scans per sample.4.8.2.Evaluation of the •NO Radical Levels Based on the methods published by Yoshioka et al.[ 54] and Yokoyama et al.[ 55], we developed and adapted the EPR method for the estimation of •NO radical levels.Brieﬂy, to a 50 µM solution of carboxy 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl was added imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium salt (carboxy PTIO.K) dissolved in a mixture of 50 mMTris (pH 7.5) and DMSO in a ratio 9:1.
To the 100 µL samples was added 900 µL Tris buffer dissolved in DMSO (9:1). After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 ×grpm for 10 min at 4◦C.Then, 100 µL of the sample and 100 µL 50 mM solution of carboxy PTIO.K were mixed and EPR spectra of spin adducts formed between the spin trap carboxy PTIO.K and generated•NO radicals were recorded.The •NO radicals levels were calculated as double-integrated plots of EPR spectra, and the results were expressed in a.u.The EPR settings were as follows: 3505 G centerﬁeld, 6.42 mW microwave power, 5 G modulation amplitude, 75 G sweep width, 2.5 ×102gain, 40.96 ms time constant, 60.42 s sweep time, and one scan per sample.Pharmaceuticals 2023 ,16, 1365 15 of 18 4.8.3.TEMPOL A nitroxide radical solution (50 µL 2 mM) was added to the kidney homogenate samples and stirred on a vortex for 5 s at room temperature.The reaction mixture (nitrox- ide/serum sample) is incubated for 10 min.
The samples are taken in a microcapillary, placed in the EPR cavity, and started measurements. Each sample was scanned twice and repeated [56].4.9.Immunoenzyme Assays 4.9.1.Determination of the Activity of Antioxidant Enzyme System and Products of Oxidation of Proteins and Lipids in the Kidney To determine the enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSPx), and oxidative stress parameters malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl content (PCC) and glycation end products (AGEs) were used with ELISA kits (Wuhan Fine Biotech Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China) by following the manufacturer’s instructions.4.9.2.Measurement of Proinﬂammatory Markers in Kidney Tissue and Blood The cytokine levels (IL-1 β, IL-10, IL-6, ITF- γ, and TNF- α) were measured with ELISA kits at the end of the experiment.4.10.Statistical Analysis The obtained results were processed with Statistica 8.0 (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) and presented as mean ±standard error (SE).
Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and a post-hoc LSD test to determine signiﬁcant differences among data groups. A p-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.5.Conclusions In the present study, we reported signiﬁcantly elevated oxidative stress with accom- panying increased production of ROS, decreased redox potential, increased production of cytokines, and evidence for changes in the GPX4 axis and ferroptosis in the GN-treated mice.Protection with vitamin E (400 mg/kg p.o.) or silymarin (200 mg/kg p.o.) recov- ers most of the parameters of inﬂammation, oxidative stress and ferroptosis.The results presented above suggest that inhibition of GN-induced kidney injury affects not only the survival of the cells but also improves their anti-inﬂammatory status and oxidative balance.Vitamin E and silymarin as ferrostatins could be used as complementary agents against gentamicin-induced side effects and, in particular, its nephrotoxicity.
