Cross-coupling of CO and an isocyanide mediated by a tetrameric magnesium hydride cluster † Wenbang Yang, Andrew J.P.White and Mark R.Crimmin * Sequential addition of CNXyl (Xyl =2,6-dimethylphenyl) and CO to a tetrametallic magnesium hydride cluster results in stepwise reduction and cross-coupling of these substrates.Cross-coupling results in the formation of an ethene amidolate ligand [OC1(H1)]C2(H2)NAr]2−a previously unknown entity which contains a 1,2-difunctionalised carbon chain reminiscent of those found in aminoalcohols and aminoacids.To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst example of such reactivity with metal hydride precursors.DFT calculations support a mechanism that parallels that established for coupling of CO toform ethenediolate ligands, with the key carbon –carbon bond step occurring by nucleophilic attack of a putative azamethylene intermediate on CO.The cluster plays a key role in templating the synthesis,providing kinetic control over each of the steps.
The ethene amidolate ligand can be transferred to other metals (Al) and semi-metals (B) through onwards metathesis reactions. Introduction Carbon monoxide (CO) is an attractive C 1building block for the construction of more complex organic molecules.In the pastfew years there has been increased interest in reactions that combine two (or more) molecules of CO to construct carbon chains.1–5Controlling selectivity in these reactions is important; both the chain length and the ratio of C : H : O are key factors.Focusing on C 2products, it has been shown that two equiva- lents of CO can be combined at reducing metal centres to formethynediolates, 6–12ethenediolates,13–19ethanediolates,20 ketenes,21an acetaldehyde enolate,22and ethene.23Isocyanides (CNR, R =alkyl, aryl) are isoelectronic with CO.Related reac- tions that combine two or more equivalents of isocyanide to form homocoupled products are widely reported (Fig.
1).24–38 When considering these studies, an obvious question arises asto whether it might be possible to combine CO and CNR to form cross-coupled products. For the C 2series this would potentially lead to the formation of products containing a 1,2-difunction-alised carbon chain with vicinal oxygen and nitrogen containingfunctional groups.Such substitution patterns are found inamino acids, b-aminoketones, and 1,2-aminoalcohols and are common across natural products, medicinally relevantcompounds, and privileged ligand structures.Precedent for the cross-coupling of CO with CNR is limited to a handful of examples.
Stepwise reaction of CO and CNR witha zirconium( IV) dialkyl complex to form a substituted ethene amidolate was reported as early as 1985.39This type of reactivity has been observed at group 4 metal dialkyl complexes sup-ported by alkoxide, 40tropocoronand,41and N-heterocyclic car- bene ligands.42Related titanocyclobutane complexes,43and seven coordinate niobium and tantalum complexes have also been reported to react with CO and CNR to form substituted ethene amidolates.44,45In contrast, a thorium alkyl complex was shown to react with CO and CNR to form a keteniminespecies. 46,47Binuclear silylene compounds are known to cross- couple and deoxygenated CO and CNR to form functionalisedketenimine products.48To the best of our knowledge, despite nearly 40 years of interest in these types of reactions, cross-coupling reactions of CO and CNR at main group metals are unknown.All examples of cross-coupling reported to date employ low-oxidation state compounds or metal alkylcomplexes.
There are no examples of reactions that employmetal hydrides, meaning the parent ethene amidolate ligand[OCH]CHNR] 2−(R=alkyl, aryl) is an unknown chemical entity. In this paper, we report the stepwise cross-coupling of CO and CNXyl (Xyl =2,6-dimethylphenyl) using a tetrametallic Fig.1 Ethenediolate, ethene amidolate, and diamidolate structures based on two carbon units.Department of Chemistry, Molecular Sciences Research Hub, 82 Wood Lane, Shepherds Bush, London, W12 0BZ, UK.E-mail: m.crimmin@imperial.ac.uk †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.CCDC 2289252, 2308757 – 2308759, 2313439 and 2328581.For ESI and crystallographic data in CIF or other electronic format see DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/d4sc02638aCite this: Chem.Sci.,2 0 2 4 , 15,1 1 8 0 7 All publication charges for this article have been paid for by the Royal Societyof Chemistry Received 21st April 2024 Accepted 22nd June 2024 DOI: 10.1039/d4sc02638arsc.li/chemical-science © 2024 The Author(s).

Results and discussion Cross-coupling of CO and CNXyl The tetrametallic magnesium hydride cluster 1awas originally reported by Harder and co-workers.49Related species have recently been documented from Kretschmer's group.50Previ- ously we showed that 1areacts with two equiv. CO by a deoxy- genative pathway leading to the formation of a coordinatedacetaldehyde enolate.22 Reaction of 1awith 2-6-dimethylphenylisocyanide for 3 h at 25 °C in benzene led to selective formation of the bis(imine) complex 2aderived from a 2 : 1 reaction stoichiometry (Scheme 1).Insertion of the isocyanide occurs exclusively at only one ofthe two possible types of hydride sites in 1a.2awas charac- terised by diagnostic resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum (C6D6)a t d=8.83 (s) and 3.38 (s) ppm each integrating to 2H and assigned to the CH ]NAr imine proton and unreacted hydride ligands respectively.
The former resonance showsa cross-peak in the HSQC data to a 13C resonance at d=157.7 ppm assigned to the CH ]NAr imine carbon atom. In the solid-state, 2aretains a tetrametallic structure with the dinu- cleating ligands templating a close arrangement of fourmagnesium atom in an approximate tetrahedral arrangement(Fig.2a).The newly formed imine ligands adopt a k 2-C, N coordination mode, bridging two of the magnesium sites of thetetrahedra, the remaining two metals are bridged by theunreacted hydrides.The Mg –C bond lengths of the metalated imine are 2.1778(17) and 2.1830(17) Å, while the Mg –N bond lengths are 2.1185(15) and 2.1428(14) Å.In contrast, addition of 4 equiv.of methylisocyanide to 1led to the formation of 2b, derived from exhaustive insertion of the unsaturated substrate into all four hydride sites (Scheme 1,Fig.2b).It remains likely that variation of the sterics of thesubstituent of the isocyanide directly in uences the outcome.
Onwards reaction of 2awith CO for 14 h at 60 °C in benzene led to 3 2(Scheme 1, Fig. 2d).32could also be prepared in a single-pot reaction from 1aby stepwise addition of CNXyl then CO.32contains two ethene amidolate ligands derived from cross-coupling of an isocyanide and CO.Each new C 2fragment in32originates from a 2 : 1 : 1 reaction of hydride : CO : CNXyl.This is the rst example of this reactivity at a metal hydride complex and as such the rst time a simple unsubstituted ethene amidolate ligand, [OC1(H1)]C2(H2)NAr]2−, has been observed to form from CO.In C 6D6solution, 32was charac- terised by diagnostic, non-equivalent, protons of the ethene amidolate moiety H1and H2which resonate at d=5.03 (d,3JH–H =2.2 Hz) and 6.29 (d,3JH–H=2.2 Hz) ppm.These correlate with 13C environments C1and C2atd=102.9 and 152.2 ppm respectively.
Reaction of 2awith13CO allowed synthesis of13C- 32.13C-3 2is monotopically labelled at the C1position and there is no evidence for inclusion of the isotope at the C2position of Scheme 1 Reactions of a tetrametallic magnesium hydride cluster 1awith isocyanides and CO. 11808 |Chem.Sci.,2 0 2 4 , 15, 11807 –11813 © 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of ChemistryChemical Science Edge Article the ligand or elsewhere.The1JC–Hand2JC–Hcoupling constants take values of 139.2 and 10.8 Hz respectively.In the solid-state,3 2again retains a tetrametallic structure albeit with loss of the tetrahedral arrangement of the magnesium sites.The structureof3 2is perhaps best conceptualised as a dimer of two dimag- nesium fragments related through an inversion symmetry operation.Each dimagnesium fragment is coordinated by thedinucleating bis( b-diketiminate) ligand and the ethene amido- late which coordinates one magnesium atom k 2-O,N and the other in a k1-O fashion.
The two dimagnesium fragments dimerise to form an open tetrametallic cluster with the fourmagnesium sites orientated in a butter y-like con guration. Dimerisation occurs viabridging oxygen atoms of the ethene amidolate, such that these end up adopting a m 3-bridging mode.Consistent with the small coupling constant between the H1 and H2positions, the ethene amidolate adopts a cis-congura- tion.The ethene amidolate is formally a dianionic ligand, bondlengths to Mg are unremarkable.The C 1–O, C2–N, and C1]C2 bond lengths take values of 1.421(3), 1.357(3) and 1.375(3) Å respectively.Dissolving crystalline samples of 32in THF followed by analysis of the resultant sample by1H NMR spectroscopy, either in C 6D6or THF, led to signi cant changes of the resonances assigned to the ethene amidolate ligand, with H1and H2now resonating at d=5.42 (d,3JH–H=3.4 Hz) and 5.32 (d,3JH–H=3.4 Hz) ppm respectively.
Recrystallisation revealed the formationof3-THF 2, a product of fragmentation of the tetrametallic structure into a single dimagnesium motif (Scheme 1, Fig. 2e).In the solid state, THF preferentially solvates only one of themagnesium centres, leading to an asymmetric structure con- taining both 4- and 5-coordinate metals.The C 1–O, C2–N, and C1]C2bond lengths of the ethene amidolate are near identical to those observed in 32.The reaction is non-reversible and attempts to remove THF from 3-THF 2under high vacuum (1 × 10−4mbar) did not lead to reformation of 32.DFT calculations were conducted.Geometries were opti- mised with the B3PW91-D3 functional using a hybrid basis-setcomprised of 6-31G **(C,H,N,O) and SDDAll (Mg).Solvation was taken into account in the optimisation using the polariz-able continuum model (benzene).Single point corrections toenergies were conducted with triple-zeta basis set 6-311+G ** applied to all energies.
These calculations suggest that the fragmentation of 3 2to 2 equiv. 3is disfavoured in the absence of a coordinating solvent ( DG298 K °=+46.2 kcal mol−1;DH°= +66.0 kcal mol−1).Deaggregation becomes more favourable in the presence of THF with conversion of 32+ 4 THF/23-THF 2 being only modestly endergonic ( DG298 K °=+11.5 kcal mol−1; DH°=−19.2 kcal mol−1).In the presence of an excess THF (solvent) the equilibrium is likely displaced to the products,allowing the isolation of 3-THF 2(see ESI, Fig.S19 †).DOSY NMR studies suggest that the nuclearity of 32and 3-THF 2observed in the solid-state is potentially retained in solution.In C 6D6at 298 K the di ﬀusion coe ﬃcient of 32was measured as 7.8 ×10−10m2 s−1while 3-THF 2in THF-d 8solution di ﬀused at a substantial faster rate of 1.1 ×10−9m2s−1(see ESI, Fig.S9 and S10 †).The data correspond to estimated hydrodynamic radii of 9.3 Å for 32 and 7.2 Å for 3-THF 2consistent with 32retaining its tetrame- tallic structure in solution.Fig.

Binding to magne-sium is primarily ionic with NPA charges on Mg (+1.82, +1.83)being highly positive and those on O ( −1.19,−1.20) and N (−0.91,−0.94) uniformly negative. There also appears to be some diﬀerences in the degree of this delocalisation across the diﬀerent amidoenolates in the calculated structures 3 2and 3- THF 2suggesting the ligand can respond and augment its polar- isation dependent on the local environment.The molecularorbitals of [OC 1(H1)]C2(H2)NAr]2−are consistent with its potential to act as both a s-a n d p-donor ligand, with the HOMO, HOMO-1 and HOMO-2 showing character of both oxygen andnitrogen-based lone-pairs in the plane and orthogonal to the site of metal coordination (see ESI, Fig.S20 –S22†).Mechanism Further calculations were under taken to shed light on the mecha- nism that leads to the formation of 3 2.For simplicity, these calcu- lations were initiated from 2aas the reactant.
We have previously calculated insertion of CO into two of the Mg –H bonds of 1aand proposed structures similar to 2ain the homologation and deoxy- genation of CO using this tetrametallic cluster.22A plausible pathway for ethene amidolate formation was found (Fig. 4).Thispathway parallels the most common pathway described for ethe- nediolate formation in reactions of metal hydrides with CO.51,52 The pathway is initiated by an intramolecular hydro- magnesiation (or hydride transfer) to one of the metallated imineligands of 2a.This step occurs by TS-1 (DG ‡ 298 K=28.3 kcal mol−1) and leads directly to an azamethylene intermediate Int-1 .T h e structure of Int-1 parallels established oxymethylene intermedi- ates in CO homologation.
CO coordination to Int-1 forms Int-2 , with subsequent insertion into a Mg –C bond of the azamethylene motif occurring viaTS-2 (DG‡ 298 K=25.8 kcal mol−1).TS-2 leads directly to Int-3 a n di st h ek e yc a r b o n –carbon bond forming stepthat creates the 1,2-difunctionalised carbon chain. TS-2 appears late on the potential energy surface, C1/C2bond forming is advanced and occurs with nucleophilic attack of the aza-methylene carbon C 2on C1of the coordinated CO ligand.1,2- Hydride migration can then occur from Int-3 .Int-3 can isomerise toInt-4 through rotation about the C1–C2bond, this step neces- sarily occurs with decoordination of the nitrogen atom from oneMg site and recoordination to another.Despite our best e ﬀorts we were unable to identify a transition state for this process, based on scans of the potential energy surface we suggest the rearrange- ment is extremely facile.
1,2-Hydride migration from Int-4 can occur by the low energy TS-3 and leads directly to the cis-isomer of the ethene amidolate ligand, Int-5 . The sequence of hydro- magnesiation, CO insertion, and 1,2-hydride migration thenrepeats ultimately leading to the experimentally determinedproduct 3 2.Analysis of the complete pathway for formation of 32 reveals that the formation of the 1st and 2nd ethene amidolate ligands occurs with similar barriers, consistent with the lack of observable intermediates in the conversion of 2ato32.T h eg l o b a l barrier is associated with the 1st hydride transfer step from 2aand isDG‡ 298 K=28.3 kcal mol−1which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental conditions for the reaction (14 h, 60 °C).Throughout the calculated pathway the tetrametallic cluster templates bond making and breaking events and adapts itsgeometry to ultimately accommodating the ligands in the most thermodynamic favourable binding sites.
Curious as to whether the tetrametallic structure was essential for the observed reac-tivity, we revisited the reactions of dimeric magnesium hydrideswith isocyanides. Previously it has been shown that 1breacts with cyclohexyl isocyanide and tert-butyl isocyanide to form double insertion products.13,53In our hands, reaction of 1bwith 2-6-dimethylphenylisocyanide in C 6D6for 14 h at 60 °C allowed the isolation of the mono-insertion product 2c(Scheme 2, Fig.2c).Like the tetrametallic analogue 2a,2cstill contains a single unreacted hydride site and hence based on our postu-lated mechanism, could potentially react with CO to generate anethene amidolate ligand.Addition of CO to 2cand monitoring the reaction for 14 h at 25 °C provided no evidence for carbon – carbon bond formation.Over this time, 2cwas fully consumed and a complex mixture was formed, suggesting that if an etheneamidolate ligand is generated it is only transient and reacts further under the conditions of the experiment.
Transfer of the ethene amidolate ligand The amidoenolate ligand of 3 2could be transferred to alterna- tive metals and semi-metal through metathesis reactions (Scheme 3, Fig. 2f).These reactions generated products inwhich the amidoenolate is coordinated to aluminium ( 4a) and Scheme 2 Reaction of a magnesium hydride dimer 1bwith an iso- cyanide to form 2c.Scheme 3 Transfer of the ethene amidolate ligand from 32to aluminium forming 4aand boron forming 5.© 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry Chem.Sci.,2 0 2 4 , 15, 11807 –11813 | 11811Edge Article Chemical Science boron ( 5).Transfer of the amidoenolate is driven by the highly ionic interaction with magnesium and thermodynamically favourable formation of the corresponding magnesium chloridebyproduct, which can be separated by fractional crystallisation.NMR spectroscopic data along with single crystal X-ray di ﬀrac- tion studies suggest that the amidoenolate remains bound asak 2-O,N ligand in both 4aand 5.
Conclusions In summary, stepwise reaction of CNXyl and CO with a tetrame- tallic magnesium hydride cluster results in reduction and crosscoupling of the substrates to form a unique ethene amidolateligand. This new C 2fragment contains a 1,2-difunctionalised motif.Prior work has established that this type of reactivity ispossible with early transition metal alkyl complexes or low-valentsilicon complexes, but to the best of our knowledge this is therst example involving a metal hydride precursor.A metalated imine complex ( 2a) was identi ed as an intermediate in cross- coupling.Data suggest the formation of this species at themagnesium cluster is under strict kinetic control as variation ofeither the isocyanide or magnesium complex leads to alternativeproducts that are non-productive in cross-coupling.DFT calcu-lations support a mechanism that evolves from the metalatedimine to an azamethylene intermediate by a second hydridetransfer.
Carbon –carbon bond formation can occur by nucleo- philic attack of the azamethylene on CO, with subsequent 1,2- hydrogen migration establishing the ethene amidolate structure.This pathway closely parallels that established for ethenediolateformation from CO and metal hydride complexes. Onwardsreaction of the cross-coupled product ( 3 2) has established that the ethene amidolate ligands can be transferred to alternativefragments by metathesis reactions.The discovery that metalhydride complexes are competent in cross-coupling of iso- cyanides and CO could inspire new approaches toward the synthesis of amino alcohols and amino acids from inexpensiveand readily available C 1building block.Data availability Synthetic procedures, kinetic experiments, NMR spectra of allcompounds, crystal structures of 2a,2b,2c,3 2,3-THF 2,and 4a, crystallographic data, and computational methods (PDF).Cartesian coordinates of the DFT-optimized structures (XYZ) are available as part of the ESI.
