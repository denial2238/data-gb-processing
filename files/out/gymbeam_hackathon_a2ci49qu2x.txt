Modeling a methylmalonic acid–derived change point for serum vitamin B-12 for adults in NHANES1–4 Regan L Bailey, Ramon A Durazo-Arvizu, Ralph Carmel, Ralph Green, Christine M Pfeiffer, Christopher T Sempos, Alicia Carriquiry, and Elizabeth A Yetley ABSTRACT Background: No consensus exists about which cutoff point should be applied for serum vitamin B-12 (SB-12) concentrations to deﬁne vitamin B-12 status in population-based research.Objective: The study’s aim was to identify whether a change point exists at which the relation between plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) and SB-12 changes slope to differentiate between inade- quate and adequate vitamin B-12 status by using various statisticalmodels.Design: We used data on adults ( $19 y; n= 12,683) from NHANES 1999–2004—a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey.Weevaluated 6 piece-wise polynomial and exponential decay modelsthat used different control levels for known covariates.
Results: The MMA-deﬁned change point for SB-12 varied depend- ing on the statistical model used. A linear-splines model was de-termined to best ﬁt the data, as determined by the approximate permutation test; 3 slopes relating SB-12 and MMA and resulting in 2 change points and 3 subgroups were shown.The ﬁrst group(SB-12 ,126 pmol/L) was small and had the highest MMA con- centration (median: 281 nmol/L; 95% CI: 245, 366 nmol/L; n= 157, 1.2%); many in this group could be considered at high risk of severedeﬁciency because combined abnormalities of MMA and homocys-teine were very frequent and the concentrations themselves were signiﬁcantly higher.The highest SB-12 group (SB-12 .287 pmol/ L;n= 8569, 67.6%) likely had adequate vitamin B-12 status (me- dian MMA: 120 nmol/L; 95% CI: 119, 125 nmol/L).
The vitamin B-12 status of the sizable intermediate group ( n= 3957, 33%) was difﬁcult to interpret.Conclusions : The 3 distinct slopes for the relation between SB-12 and MMA challenges the conventional use of one cutoff point for classifying vitamin B-12 status. In epidemiologic research, the useof one cutoff point would fail to separate the small, severely de- ﬁcient group from the intermediate group that has neither normal nor clearly deﬁcient vitamin B-12 concentrations (ie, unknown vi-tamin B-12 status).This intermediate group requires further char-acterization.Am J Clin Nutr 2013;98:460–7.INTRODUCTION Serum vitamin B-12 (SB-12)5concentrations directly reﬂect circulating vitamin B-12 concentrations, whereas methyl-malonic acid (MMA) accumulates in the absence of adequate vitamin B-12 concentrations and is considered a “functional” indicator of vitamin B-12 status (1, 2).Each of these biomarkershas limitations in sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
To minimize theselimitations, some experts have suggested the use of both a direct measure and a functional measure to assess vitamin B-12 statusin population-based studies (3–7). Previously, using this com- bined biomarker approach with commonly used cutoff points for adults in NHANES, we determined that w1% of US adults had both a low SB-12 and a high plasma MMA concentration, which indicated a suboptimal vitamin B-12 status (8).A critical step in deﬁning a population’s vitamin B-12 status is the selection of applicable cutoffs (3).Recently, a roundtable of experts identiﬁed uncertainties in the published cutoff points for biomarkers of vitamin B-12 status (7).Indeed, when thisgroup applied different cutoff points that are commonly used inthe scientiﬁc literature to each biomarker in isolation, the prevalence of low SB-12 concentrations ranged from 3% to 26%, and the prevalence of high MMA concentrations rangedfrom 2% to 6% (8).
The purpose of the current analysis was to examine whether a change point exists at which the relation between SB-12 andMMA concentrations changes the slope to help differentiate between adequate and inadequate vitamin B-12 status (9, 10). We used various statistical models with data on a large NHANESpopulation after controlling for confounding variables that are known to affect these biomarker measurements but are not related to vitamin B-12 status.1From the Ofﬁce of Dietary Supplements, NIH, Bethesda, MD (RLB, CTS, and EAY); the Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University, Chicago,IL (RAD-A); the Department of Medicine, New York Methodist Hospital, Brooklyn, NY (RC); Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY (RC); the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UC Davis MedicalCenter, Sacramento, CA (RG); the Department of Statistics, Iowa StateUniversity, Ames, IA (AC); and the National Center for Environmental Health, CDC, Atlanta, GA (CMP).

/C2112013 American Society for Nutrition SUBJECTS AND METHODS NHANES NHANES is a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of the noninstitutionalized US population that uses a complex,stratiﬁed, multistage probability cluster sampling design. TheNational Center for Health Statistics of the CDC collects the NHANES data.Survey participants are ﬁrst interviewed in their homes; at this interview, demographic information, data on di-etary supplement use, and some health-related data are collected.Participants then complete a standardized physical examination, 24-h dietary recall, and a blood draw in a mobile examinationcenterw1–2 wk later.Analytic sample For this study, we combined data from NHANES 1999–2000, 2001–2002, and 2003–2004 ( n= 31,126).
We excluded data on anyone younger than 19 y ( n= 14,942); those with only in- terview data (ie, lacking mobile examination center data, n= 1160); lactating ( n= 145) and pregnant ( n= 802) females; and those with missing MMA ( n= 928), SB-12 ( n= 114), or cre- atinine ( n= 107) data. We also excluded those with SB-12 concentrations greater than the 99th percentile ( .1265 pmol/L; range: 25–148,935 pmol/L; n= 135).Extraordinarily high SB- 12 concentrations almost always reﬂect phenomena that are unrelated to vitamin B-12 metabolism or status and can exert substantial inﬂuence over the change point, leading to biasedmodels.Finally, we excluded those with an estimated glomer- ular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) ,30 (n= 116) because impaired kidney function increases MMA and vitamin B-12 concentra-tions independently of vitamin B-12 status ( seeSupplemental Table 1 under “Supplemental data” in the online issue).The ﬁnal analytic sample size was 12,683.
Written informed consent wasobtained from all participants; the survey protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Board of the National Center for Health Statistics. Interview and examination response rates foreach survey year are publicly available (11).Biochemical methods NHANES 1999–2004 measured SB-12 concentrations with the use of the Quantaphase II radioassay (BioRad).Plasma totalhomocysteine (tHcy) concentrations were measured by usinga ﬂuorescence polarization immunoassay reagent kit (Abbott Laboratories) (12) and plasma MMA concentrations by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry after cyclohexanol de-rivatization of the extracted MMA.NHANES 1999–2000 mea- sured serum creatinine by using the Jaffe method with the Hitachi 917 multichannel analyzer, and NHANES 2001–2004used the Jaffe rate method (kinetic alkaline picrate) with the Beckman Synchron LX20 modular chemistry analyzer.
We ad- justed serum creatinine data for NHANES 1999–2000 using theequation 0.147 + 1.013 3uncorrected serum creatinine (mg/dL), as the analytic note recommends (13). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured by latex-enhanced nephelometry on a BN II nephelometer (Dade Behring).Details and documentation foreach of these methods and the biomarker coefﬁcients of variations for each survey year are publicly available on the NHANES website (14–16).Vitamin B-12 exposure Dietary supplement information was collected via the NHANES Dietary Supplement Questionnaire, which determines each participant’s intakes of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and otherdietary supplements over the past 30 d.The average daily intake of vitamin B-12 from all supplements was calculated (17).
Six participants in our sample had very high intakes of supplementalvitamin B-12; because this might have been a result of the metric in which the dose was provided (mL), we are uncertain whether the data on their intake are reliable. We Winsorizedthese 6 observations to the next highest value of 3000 mg.Data on one 24-h dietary recall are available for each par- ticipant for 1999–2002 and on two 24-h dietary recalls for 2003–2004.We used the vitamin B-12 intakes from the ﬁrst 24-h dietaryrecall from 2003 to 2004; if day 1 24-h dietary recall data were missing but day 2 data were available, we used the day 2 data.We report intake data as means or medians rather than the pre-valence of low values because of the inability to correct for within-person variability.Because of limitations in the food- composition databases, estimates of vitamin B-12 intake in1999–2004 did not account for bioavailability differences be- tween naturally occurring and added vitamin B-12 sources (18).
We combined data on the average daily intake of vitamin B-12from supplemental sources with the daily estimates of vitamin B-12 intake from foods to reﬂect total vitamin B-12 exposure. Dietary data were available for 12,124 participants.Statistical models and analysis We estimated descriptive statistics of the sample by using SAS-Callable Sudaan (version 9.3) and used the examination survey weights to make the estimates reﬂective of the US adultpopulation.We determined statistical comparisons by using diffvar statements in PROC DESCRIPT.We log transformed any nonnormal variables before statistical comparison.The medianMMA concentrations, tHcy concentrations, and dietary vitamin B-12 intakes might be more descriptive of each group than the mean values, because some very high values skewed the meansand, thus, their interpretability.ORs of having elevated MMA(.271 nmol/L) or tHcy ( .13 nmol/L) were derived via PROC RLOGIST in Sudaan.
Statistical signiﬁcance was set at P,0.05 All models To reduce heteroscedasticity and skewness of the distribution, we selected the log-transformed MMA concentration as the dependent variable after examining several possible trans-formations for both MMA and SB-12. All models were examined with several covariates that were signiﬁcant predictors of log- MMA in stepwise regression models; the covariates that weexamined included eGFR, age, ethnicity, dietary and supple- mental intakes of vitamin B-12, use of antibiotics, session of blood collection, hours of fasting, and C-reactive protein con-centrations.We examined all models using 3 tiers of adjustment.Tier 1 was unadjusted, tier 2 was minimally adjusted (ie, for eGFR, hours of fasting before the blood draw, and age), and tier 3 was maximally adjusted (ie, for all covariates).We found noappreciable differences in the models based on the tier level of adjustment that we used.
We therefore present results using the minimally adjusted models, which controlled only for the mostMETHYLMALONIC ACID AND SERUM VITAMIN B-12 461 relevant factors. Use of these models maximized the df and therefore enhanced statistical reliability while ensuring that adjustments for the effects of known biological covariates weremade.The ﬁrst step was to use locally weighted regression or the locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) technique.LOESS is an unweighted nonparametric scatterplot of the data to deﬁne the optimal shape of the function to summarize the nature of the relation for the 2 biomarkers (19, 20).Once conﬁrmed bythe LOESS model, we used 2 broad types of modeling procedures (exponential decay and piece-wise polynomial) to best “mimic” the shape of the function of the relation of SB-12 and log-MMAconcentrations.
For both of these model types, we accounted forthe multistage sampling scheme and sampling weights by using an adaptation of the SVY module in the STATA statistical package (version 12; StataCorp). The change point estimateswere ﬁrst determined for each model type; the 95% CIs around the change point estimates were derived by a bootstrapping tech- nique that accounted for the survey design.The bootstrap methodfor complex survey data are implemented by the bsweights command in STATA (21).Exponential model Exponential models, sometimes called nonlinear exponential or exponential decay models, are ideal for working with bi-ological phenomena because they permit modeling of the non- linear relation between 2 variables and estimations of the rate of change of one variable ( y) as a function of another ( x) while confounding factors are accounted for.Speciﬁcally, the follow-ing model was ﬁt to our data: logðMMA Þ¼AþB3e 2c3B12ð1Þ where A,B, and Care nonnegative variables to be estimated.
Notice that this exponential curve approaches a plateau equal to the variable A for large values of vitamin B-12. Thus, for theexponential model in this analysis, the “no change” point was deﬁned as the smallest value of SB-12 for which log-MMA is not signiﬁcantly different from its plateau value under themodel.Precisely, the variable Awas estimated along with the corresponding SE by using the least-squares method.The point of “no-change” was determined as that value of vitamin B-12 for which log MMA, under the model, equals the upper limit of the95% CI of A.CIs for the “no change” point were calculated by the bias corrected bootstrap approach, accounting for design effects.Piece-wise polynomial In the linear-linear model, 2 lines are ﬁt to the data; these 2 lines are connected at the change point or “knot.” We applied 2 additional piece-wise polynomial models to the data.
The other “2-phase” models (ie, linear-quadratic and quadratic-quadratic)did not improve the ﬁt compared with the simpler linear-linearmodel, and we do not discuss them extensively in this report. The linear-splines model draws several smaller lines throughout the data, and these lines are joined in an iterative process toreduce the residual sum of squares; these minimal join points were used to determine the change point for the linear-splines model.The 2-knot approach that we used in this analysis had 3phases: during phase 1, MMA concentrations declined rapidly with increasing SB-12 concentrations; in phase 2, MMA con- centrations decreased much more slowly with increasing SB-12 concentrations; and in phase 3, MMA concentrations no longerchanged as a function of SB-12 concentrations.For all of the piece-wise models, we estimated the regression parameters and change points by performing a grid search (22).
Brieﬂy, we divided the vitamin B-12 distribution range into anequally spaced grid. For the one-knot (linear-linear) model, we ﬁtted a piece-wise linear model for each of the grid values.We deemed the grid values resulting in the smallest residual sum ofsquares to be the best estimator of the change point.We esti- mated the 2 change points in a 2-knot model in a similar fashion by selecting 2 grid values at a time and ﬁtting a piece-wise linearregression model.The model with the smallest residual sum ofsquares yielded estimators for the knots and regression param- eters.Estimation of change points via the grid process makes use of the residual sum of squares, which in turn uses thesampling weights information but does not use the survey design (ie, primary sampling units and strata) in the estimation.The computer implementation of the grid algorithm requires thespeciﬁcation of the search range.
In this analysis, the data were examined for the change point between the 1st and 99th per- centiles of the vitamin B-12 distribution. Model ﬁt To determine the most robust of “best-ﬁt” model, we tested the selection between the zero-knot (linear regression), one- knot (linear-linear), and 2-knot (linear-splines) models using anTABLE 1 Change points derived for serum vitamin B-12 as a function of plasma MMA by using different modeling techniques1 Change points (95% CIs) R2value2 pmol/L % Exponential 212 (184, 289) 24.7 Linear-linear 193 (182, 279) 24.0 Linear-quadratic 260 (192, 371) 22.8Quadratic-quadratic 314 (266, 442) 23.7Linear splines 3126 (117, 182), 287 (253, 434) 25.1 1Data from NHANES 1999–2000, 2001–2002, and 2003–2004 (n= 31,126) were combined.

The ﬁnal analytic sample size was 12,683.Age, glomerular ﬁltration rate, and hours of fasting were controlled for before theblood samples were drawn.Other relevant covariates were examined, whichwere not inﬂuential in determining the change point.See supplementary analytic materials under “Supplemental data” in the online issue for details.NHANES assessed serum vitamin B-12 concentrations by using the Quan-taphase II radioassay from BioRad and plasma MMA concentrations with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry.MMA, methylmalonic acid.
2Deﬁned as the amount of variability in serum vitamin B-12 that is explained by the model; this value is not interpreted as a ﬁt statistic. 3The linear-splines (2-knot) model was statistically more robust than was the exponential model (ie, zero-knot; P,0.001) or the one-knot model (P,0.001), determined by the approximate permutations test.462 BAILEY ET AL approximate permutation test to determine the best model to describe the relation between SB-12 and log-MMA (23).This procedure was used to test whether the 2-knot model is preferredover the zero-knot model.If signiﬁcant, then compare the 2-knot compared with the one-knot model.The ﬁrst step in the appli- cation of the approximate permutation test is to ﬁt the nullmodel (ie, the zero-knot model) and compute the residuals (observed minus expected), followed by randomly permutating these residuals and adding them to predicted value (under thenull model).
Next, a grid search approach is applied to ﬁt thealternative model (ie, 2-knot model) to the resulting data and compute the residuals. An F-like goodness-of-ﬁt test statistic is constructed by using these 2 sets of residuals.The distribution ofthis test statistic is approximated by Monte Carlo simulations, andPvalues are determined from the resulting distribution.RESULTS We determined different SB-12 change points by using each model strategy ( Table 1 ).The exponential model with its cur- vilinear rate of change most closely mimicked the LOESS curve (ie, the curve that describes the scatter of the 2 variables) (Figure 1 ).Using the LOESS procedure by age group, we ob- served a similarly shaped curve in the relation between MMAand SB-12 concentrations across age groups, although the curves occurred at higher MMA values for groups with increasing age (Figure 2 ).
The statistically based approximate permutation test showed that the linear-splines model best ﬁt the data to describe the relation between SB-12 and MMA concentrations better than theexponential model ( P,0.001) or any of the “one-knot” models (P,0.001) ( seeSupplemental Figures 1 and 2 under “Sup- plemental data” in the online issue). The slope of the relationbetween MMA and SB-12 concentrations was signiﬁcantly different for each of the groups that we created by the linear- splines model ( Figure 3 ;seeSupplemental Table 2 under “Supplemental data” in the online issue).By using the cutoff points that we derived from the linear-splines model for SB-12 concentrations (Table 1), we examined 3 groups of adults byserum vitamin B-12 concentration: group 1, ,126; group 2, 126–287, and group 3, .287 pmol/L ( Table 2 ).Group 1 had a high risk of vitamin B-12 deﬁciency and represented a verysmall proportion of adults in the United States.
In addition,group 1 had the highest MMA and tHcy concentrations. The group with the highest SB-12 concentrations, group 3, had the lowest MMA and tHcy concentrations.NHANES participants inthe middle group (126–287 pmol/L), group 2, had intermediate median MMA (148 nmol/L) and tHcy (9 mmol/L) concentra- tions, although their values for these 2 biomarkers were closer tothose of the highest SB-12 group (120 nmol/L and 8 mmol/L, respectively) than to those of the lowest SB-12 group (281 nmol/ L and 12 mmol/L, respectively).When compared with group 3, both group 1 and group 2 had a signiﬁcantly increased odds ofhaving an elevated MMA or tHcy concentration: group 1 com- pared with group 3 [MMA OR: 32.1 (95% CI: 21.6, 47.8); tHcy OR: 18.5 (95% CI: 13.9, 24.5)], group 2 compared withgroup 3 [MMA OR: 3.5 (95% CI: 2.9, 4.3); tHcy OR: 3.1 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.6)].We observed no differences between the groups in FIGURE 1.

Group 2 is a group of people whose age and sexproﬁles were signiﬁcantly different from those of both the lowest and highest SB-12 groups and more closely resembled those of group 3. Racial-ethnic characteristics did not differ signiﬁcantlybetween groups 2 and 1; however, the highest proportion of non-Hispanic whites was in group 1, and the highest proportion of non-Hispanic blacks was in group 3.We observed no differences between the 3 SB-12 groups in vitamin B-12 intakes from foods alone, and the intakes from food sources appeared to be adequate with mean and median intakes above the Estimated Average Requirements of 2.0 mg/d (18).However, intakes from dietary supplements differed signiﬁ- cantly, ranging from a mean ( 6SE) of 10.3 61.5mg/d in the group 1 to 75.4 613.1mg/d in group 3.Thus, differences intotal intakes between groups were due almost exclusively to differences in supplement use.
DISCUSSION With the use of various statistical models, we quantiﬁed the complex relation between SB-12 and plasma MMA concentra- tions. The best-ﬁt model produced 3 different and independentslopes for the relation between SB-12 and MMA concentrations and yielded 2 points of change.This strategy thereby identiﬁed 3 subsets of the adult US population along the continuum of vi-tamin B-12 status that has been previously described by others inthe ﬁeld (4–7).However, our work is the ﬁrst to use a statistical model that speciﬁcally identiﬁes an intermediate group of peo- ple based on 2 cutoff points.Previous epidemiologic researcherswould have classiﬁed these people as having either deﬁcient or sufﬁcient vitamin B-12 status, but neither of these classiﬁcations seem appropriate for this group.FIGURE 3.The linear-splines model of the relation between serum vitamin B-12 and log-MMA concentrations among US adults, 1999–2004.

Group 3 ( w68% of US adults) had opti- mal vitamin B-12 status and this group had almost a ﬂat tra- jectory for the relation between vitamin B-12 and MMAconcentrations across a very wide range of SB-12 values (Figure 3C). Group 2, the remaining third (31%) of US adults, had SB-12 concentrations between the 2 change points.The members ofgroup 2 had a vitamin B-12 status that is arguably much more difﬁcult to interpret than the status of the other 2 groups.The increase in MMA in group 2 for a given SB-12 value was smallerthan that of group 1 and larger than that of group 3 (Figure 3C).The median MMA and tHcy concentrations of group 2 were not much higher than those of group 3, but the odds of having ele- vations in these functional indicators was 3-fold [MMA OR: 3.5(95% CI: 2.9, 4.3); tHcy OR: 3.1 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.6)].
The demographic data gave a mixed picture of group 2, the age and sex proﬁles of which were similar to those of group 3 andwhose racial-ethnic proﬁles were similar to those of group 1. It is unknown to what extent individuals in this middle group were likely to progress to the more obvious vitamin B-12 deﬁciency in group 1, which individuals were simply experiencing a mild ortemporary period of vitamin B-12 deﬁciency, and which in-dividuals had reduced SB-12 for reasons unrelated to vitamin B-12 deﬁciency [eg, polymorphisms within the FUT2 gene and mutations within the TCN1 gene that alter SB-12 without al- tering MMA or tHcy concentrations (24, 25)].Previous studies have found elevated concentrations of functional biomarkers (MMA and/or tHcy) in cases in which SB-12 concentrationswere within the normal range (3, 9, 26).
Although several ob- servational studies have suggested that vitamin B-12 concen- trations in the low-normal range are associated with cognitivefunction or decline and impaired nervous system function (asreviewed in reference 10), these results require conﬁrmation in clinical trials (7).
The second unique ﬁnding of this study was that, although each of the models produced the expected curvilinear relation between MMA and SB-12 concentrations, each model also produced different points of change for SB-12 concentrations.TABLE 2 Demographic, biochemical, and dietary variables by change points determined with the linear-splines approach among US adults, 1999–20041 Serum vitamin B-12 concentrations ,126 pmol/L (n= 157)126–287 pmol/L (n= 3957).287 pmol/L (n= 8569) Percentage of sample (%) 1 33 66 Demographic characteristics2 Age (y) 53 61a,34560.3b4660.3c $60 y (%) 37 64a2161b2361c Male (%) 37 65a4861b5161c Non-Hispanic white (%) 81 64a7662a7062b Non-Hispanic black (%) 6 62a761a1261b Mexican American (%) 5 61a661a861b Biochemical variables4 Plasma MMA (nmol/L) 719 6113a17662b13762c Median (nmol/L) 281 (245, 366) 148 (140, 153) 120 (119, 125) Plasma tHcy ( mmol/L) 17 62a1060.1b860.1c Median ( mmol/L) 12 (10.9, 13.1) 9 (8.5, 8.8) 8 (7.6, 7.8) Dietary components Vitamin B-12 from food sources ( mg/d) 4.7 60.5 4.7 60.2 5.5 60.1 Median ( mg/d) 3.1 (2.5, 3.6) 3.4 (3.3, 3.6) 4.1 (3.9, 4.3) Vitamin B-12 from dietary supplements ( mg/d)510.361.5a38.869.1b75.4613.1c Median ( mg/d) 5.9 (5.6, 8.0) 6.0 (5.9, 6.0) 9.9 (8.8, 11.8) Percentage using vitamin B-12 supplements (%) 24 64a2461a4561b Total vitamin B-12 intake ( mg/d) 7.2 60.7a14.462.3b39.666.2c Median ( mg/d) 3.7 (3.3, 5.9) 4.5 (4.3, 4.8) 7.7 (7.6, 7.8) 1Data from NHANES 1999–2000, 2001–2002, and 2003–2004 ( n= 31,126) were combined.

4NHANES assessed serum vitamin B-12 concentrations by using the Quantaphase II radioassay from BioRad, plasma MMA concentrations by using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and plasma homocysteine concentrations by usinga ﬂuorescence polarization immunoassay reagent kit from Abbott Laboratories. 5Estimates are for users of dietary supplements only; the total is for users and nonusers of supplements combined.METHYLMALONIC ACID AND SERUM VITAMIN B-12 465 Thus, the derived change point is model dependent.This ﬁnding could explain some of the differences in change point con- centrations between published studies whose authors reliedprimarily on a single statistical model approach without ex- plaining why they chose the model they used (9, 27).
For ex- ample, Vogiatzoglou et al (27) used a segmented linear regressionto identify a change point of 334 pmol/L for SB-12 as a function of MMA concentration in the Hordaland Homocysteine Study in Norway; because the authors did not specify how many linearsegments they used in this study, a comparison of data from this study to our data are not possible. Conversely, the differences in change point are smaller in our study than in the results ofSelhub et al (9), who used a linear-linear model that is similar toone of the models we tested (Table 1).Selhub et al found a change point of 150 pmol/L in an NHANES III sample, whereas we found a change point of 194 pmol/L using the same modelin an NHANES 1999–2004 sample.B ecause of differences in the survey years, the ages of the subjects, changes in MMA assay methods, and use of different exclusion criteriaand covariates, a more thorough comparison of these 2 studies cannot be achieved.
Our linear-splines model suggested that using only one cutoff point to deﬁne status in survey dataoften leads to inappropriately dividing members of the in-termediate group into sufﬁcient and deﬁcient groups. Fur- thermore, the use of traditional groupings (eg, quartiles or centiles) in epidemiologic rese arch often hides the small, but clearly deﬁcient, group by combining its members with per- sons in the more “intermediate” g roup.Both of these practices l e dt om i s c l a s s i ﬁ c a t i o n .The 3-phase approach that we used is appealing not only because of its superior ability to identify subgroups but also because of its biological plausibility.The underlying patho-physiologic causes and known health risks in the deﬁcient and intermediate groups might have been different (3).
The utility of the linear-splines framework to understand vitamin B-12 statusneeds to be conﬁrmed in other population-based surveys and isprobably not practical for clinical applications in which a single cutoff point is used. This analysis had some limitations.Age affected the relation between MMA and SB-12 concentrations in our analyses.The NHANES data were cross-sectional, and the survey assessed the relations between SB-12 and MMA concentrations at a singlepoint in time.We examined several but not all types of statistical models.Because the major determinants of MMA are largely unknown (27), we probably missed some key covariates.Finally,the gold-standard approach for identifying cutoff points is the randomized clinical trial or repletion study.No data from such studies are currently available, and the statistical approach thatwe used is at best an interim approach pending the availability ofsuch data.
A common problem in understanding vitamin B-12 status in any population is that both SB-12 and MMA concen- trations vary by age independently of vitamin B-12 status (9, 22).For this reason, we recognized that the cutoff points that we derived might not be optimal for different age subgroups or populations (3). Given the negative cognitive and other health consequences that can result from clinical vitamin B-12 deﬁciency, it is critical to accurately monitor the vitamin B-12 status among all agegroups, especially among the oldest groups.This study highlightsthe difﬁculty (in the absence of clinical trials) of deﬁning thevitamin B-12 status of the population and underscores the un- certainty regarding interpretations of the available data from NHANES to estimate the population prevalence of vitamin B-12deﬁciency.These data also show the need for caution when selecting a statistical modeling approach to derive cutoff points.
Epidemiologic applications will beneﬁt from the recognition ofthe variability among statistical models and the need to critically evaluate how best to integrate statistical, biological, and practical considerations when selecting change points for assessing vita-min B-12 status.
