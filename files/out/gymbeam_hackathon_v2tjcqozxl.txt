Glycine decarboxylation through the glycine cleavage system (GCS) and glycine-serine transformation by serine hydroxymethyl- transferase (SHMT) require pyridoxal 5 #-phosphate (PLP; active form of vitamin B-6) as a coenzyme.The intake of vitamin B-6 is frequently low in humans.Therefore, we determined the effects of vitamin B-6 restriction on whole-body glycine ﬂux, the rate of glycine decarboxylation, glycine-to-serine conversion, use of glycine carbons in nucleoside synthesis, andother aspects of 1-carbon metabolism.
We used a primed, constant infusion of [1,2- 13C2]glycine and [5,5,5-2H3]leucine to quantify in vivo kinetics in healthy adults (7 males, 6 females; 20–39 y) of normal vitamin B-6 status or marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency. Vitamin B-6 restriction lowered the plasma PLP concentration from 55 64n m o l / L( m e a n 6SEM) to 23 6 1n m o l / L( P,0.0001), which is consistent with marginal deﬁciency, whereas the plasma glycine concentration increased (P,0.01).SHMT-mediated conversion of glycine to serine increased from 182 67t o2 0 5 69mmol /C1kg21/C1h21(P,0.05), but serine production using a GCS-derived 1-carbon unit (93 69v s .9 1 66mmol /C1kg21/C1h21) and glycine cleavage (163 611 vs.15168mmol /C1kg21/C1h21) were not changed by vitamin B-6 restriction.The GCS produced 1-carbon units at a rate ( ;140–170 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21) that greatly exceeds the demand for remethylation and transmethylation processes ( ;4–7mmol /C1kg21/C1h21).
We conclude that the in vivo GCS and SHMT reactions are quite resilient to the effects of marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency,presumably through a compensatory effect of increasing substrate concentration. J.Nutr.139: 452–460, 2009.Introduction Glycine has many roles in human metabolism, including as a substrate in purine and protein synthesis, as a precursor of glutathione, and as a source and acceptor of 1-carbon units.The mitochondrial glycine cleavage system (GCS)10cleaves glycine to CO 2, ammonia, and a 1-carbon unit in the methylene (-CH 2-) state as 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-methyleneTHF) (1).Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) reversibly trans- fers a 1-carbon group from 5,10-methyleneTHF to glycine,forming tetrahydrofolate (THF) and serine.Serine is the major 1-carbon source for homocysteine remethylation (2).Vitamin B-6 in the form of pyridoxal 5 #-phosphate (PLP) serves as a coenzyme in many reactions of human intermediary metab- olism.
With respect to 1-carbon metabolism, PLP is required as a coenzyme for glycine decarboxylase of the GCS, cytosolic, and1Supported by NIH grant R01 DK072398 (to J.

mitochondrial forms of SHMT, and cystathionine b-synthase and cystathionine g-lyase in the transsulfuration system. Marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency, as reﬂected by plasma PLP concentrations between 20 and 30 nmol/L (3), occurs frequently (4) and has beenassociated with coronary artery disease (5–7), stroke (8), and elevated risk of Alzheimer’s disease (9).The mechanisms respon- sible for such linkages between vitamin B-6 status and chronicdisease have not been established and often do not involve severity of deﬁciency associated with hyperhomocysteinemia.Alterations of glycine metabolism at various levels of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency have been shown in rats, with hepatic glycine con- centration inversely proportional to vitamin B-6 intake (10,11).In another study with rats, vitamin B-6 deﬁciency yielded nearly adoubling of the plasma, liver, and muscle free glycine concentra-tions (12).
Plasma glycine increased 29% in healthy participants after 4 wk of a vitamin B-6–restricted diet that provided ,0.5 mg/ d vitamin B-6 (13) and increased 26% after 3 wk of 0.16 mg/dvitamin B-6 (14). We hypothesized that the increase in glycine concentration during marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency is due to reduced activity of the vitamin B-6–dependent GCS.Thequantitative importance of the GCS is implied by the fact that loss-of-function mutations affecting genes encoding the 4 en- zymes of the GCS cause accumulation of glycine to pathologicalconcentrations, leading to nonketotic hyperglycinemia or glycineencephalopathy (15,16).Predictions of the effects of various degrees of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency on glycine metabolism are complicated, because a deﬁciency also leads to reduced activity ofother PLP-dependent enzymes in glycine metabolism, including SHMT (13,17), serine-pyruvate/alanine-glyoxylate aminotrans- ferase (18–21), and the GCS.
Changes in the activities of theseenzymes could affect the concentration and turnover of glycine in tissues and plasma. The nutritional importance of glycine in nucleoside synthesis has not been adequately determined.In de novo purine synthesis, a single molecule glycine is incorporated to form carbon-4, carbon-5, and nitrogen-7 of the purine ring, whereas carbon-2and carbon-8 derive from 1-car bon units transferred from 10-formylTHF (22).Thymidylate is formed from deoxyuridine monophosphate and the 1-carbon unit of 5,10-methyleneTHF (23).Because the GCS is a major source of cellular 5,10-methyleneTHF production, we hypothesized that the synthesis of purines and thymidylate could be impaired under conditions of marginal deﬁciency.
In an initial report regarding the in vivo kinetics of glycine- based metabolic reactions (24), we provided data from 5 healthy volunteers who underwent primed, constant infusion with[1,2- 13C2]glycine and [2H3]leucine to examine aspects of glycine metabolism in adequate vitamin B-6 status. We found a high rate of serine synthesis (193 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21) from glycine via SHMT in healthy men and women and a similarly high rate of glycinecleavage (24).These ﬁndings show quantitatively the extent to which glycine is a major substrate in serine synthesis and that the GCS is responsible for the production of 1-carbon units as5,10-methyleneTHF at a high rate.
Thus, this study showed that the mitochondrial GCS has a major quantitative role in the production of 5,10-methyleneTHF for 1-carbon metabolism.We report here further data from that study as well as the sensitivity of glycine metabolism and related reactions in 1-carbon metabolism to marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency in 13 healthyfemale and male volunteers while considering genotypes withrespect to polymorphisms related to 1-carbon metabolism. The data from the predepletion infusion from 2 of the male participants were included in a preliminary report of the assessment of glycinekinetics using protocol (24).Methods Materials [1,2-13C2]Glycine, L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine, and sodium [13C]bicarbonate were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories.The parenteral solutions of these compounds were prepared in isotonic saline, ﬁlter sterilized, and analyzed to ensure lack of pyrogenicity and microbialcontamination.
Human participants Participants underwent a physical examination and were screened by standard clinical measures of hematological, hepatic, renal, and thyroidfunction. Medical history, dietary habits, and demographic data were assessed by a questionnaire.Of the 37 recruited healthy adult male and nonpregnant female volunteers, 23 met the following inclusion criteria:age between 20 and 40 y; no history of gastrointestinal surgery,abnormal kidney or thyroid function, or any other chronic disease; no smoking or chronic drug use or alcoholism; no vitamin, amino acid, or protein supplementation; no chronic consumption of a high-proteindiet; and a BMI ,28 kg/m 2.All selected participants were in ade- quate nutritional status for serum folate ( .7 nmol/L) and vitamin B-12 (.200 pmol/L), and plasma PLP ( .30 nmol/L) and total homocysteine (,12mmol/L).Before the study, 6 of the 23 participants that passed screening withdrew because of personal reasons or scheduling problems.
Three participants were withdrawn during intervention due to changes in healthstatus and 1 withdrew for personal reasons. All participants gave writteninformed consent.The University of Florida Institutional Review Board and the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) Scientiﬁc Advisory Committee reviewed and approved this protocol.Dietary treatment All meals were prepared by the Bionutrition Unit of the GCRC.Participants consumed nutritionally adequate meals with standardizedcomposition for 2 d to minimize dietary variation immediately prior tothe ﬁrst infusion.Participants began consuming a vitamin B-6–restricted diet (,0.5 mg/d vitamin B-6) on the day after the ﬁrst infusion and continued this regimen for 28 consecutive days (13,25).Participantsconsumed breakfast in the GCRC, were given a take-out lunch and snackto eat at their convenience, and returned to the GCRC to consume their evening meal.
We compensated for vitamin and mineral inadequacies of the study diets (other than vitamin B-6) by administering custom sup-plements daily to the participants. Compliance with the dietary regimen was monitored by weekly measurements of plasma PLP as described below.After the second infusion day, participants were offered nutrition-ally adequate meals in the GCRC.An over-the-counter, multivitamin-multimineral supplement was provided to the participants after the vitamin B-6–restricted diet to facilitate restoration of normal vitamin B-6 status.Analytical methods Screening measurements.Serum folate and vitamin B-12 were analyzed with the use of a chemiluminescence-based assay (Elecsys,Roche Diagnostics).Plasma PLP concentration was measured as the semicarbazone-derivative by reverse-phase HPLC with ﬂuorescence detec- tion (26).
Plasma total homocysteine concentration was measured asthe ammonium 7-ﬂuorobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonate derivativeby reverse-phase HPLC with ﬂuorescence detection (27). Selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were determined in DNA puriﬁed from whole blood (QIAamp DNA Mini kit; Qiagen) using a high-levelmultiplex genotyping method based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight MS (28).GC-MS determination of amino acid isotopic enrichment and quantiﬁcation.Plasma free amino acids were isolated, derivatized, and analyzed by GC-MS in electron capture negative ionization mode as previously described (29).The relative abundance of speciﬁc ions was determined by selected-ion monitoring at the following mass:chargeratios: glycine (293–295), serine (518–521), leucine (349–352), and cystathionine (677–681).
Isotopic enrichments are expressed as molar Vitamin B-6, glycine, and 1-carbon metabolism 453 ratios (mol % excess) of labeled:nonlabeled isotopomers after correction for the natural abundance of stable isotopes, essentially as performedby Storch et al. (30).Glycine, serine, and cystathionine concentrations in fasting plasma samples of each infusion day were measured by this method except with the use of stable-isotope labeled internal standards:[ 13C2]glycine, [2H3]serine, and [2H4]cystathionine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories).The calibration curve was derived from the abundances of unlabeled and labeled isotopomers.13C isotopic enrichment of breath CO 2.Breath samples were collec- ted in Exetainer tubes (Metabolic Solutions) and analyzed by isotope ratio-MS (Metabolic Solutions) to determine13C isotopic enrichment of breath CO 2.Total CO 2production rate (VCO 2) was determined with the use of a metabolic cart (TrueMax 2400; ParvoMedics).
Measurements were taken at 30-s intervals for ;5 min until 4 consecutive time points differed by no more than 60.01 L/min. Liquid chromatography-tandem MS analysis of monocyte DNA isotopic enrichment and methyldeoxycytidine concentration.Monocytes were puriﬁed from whole blood using Vacutainer SodiumHeparin CPT tubes (Becton Dickinson) followed by magnetic labeling ofthe monocytes with human CD14 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and isolation using a MACS Separation column (Miltenyi Biotec).DNA was puriﬁed from the isolated monocytes using a QIAamp DNA Mini kit(Qiagen).The concentration of DNA in each sample was quantiﬁed by the Qubit Quantitation Platform using Quant-iT ﬂuorescence technol- ogy (Invitrogen).DNA was hydrolyzed using a recently developed digestmix containing 250 U Benzonase, 300 mU phosphodiesterase I, and200 U alkaline phosphatase (31).
Isotopic enrichment was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem MS with the use of a Luna 18(2) column (50 33.0 mm, 3 mm, Phenomenex) and a Thermo-Finnigan TSQ Quantum mass spectrometer in heated electrospray ionization mode(31) with the mass transitions reported earlier (23). We employed a modiﬁcation of this procedure with the addition of [ 15N3]deoxycytidine and [15N3]methyldeoxycytidine as internal standards for the determina- tion of methyldeoxycytidine (MdC) and deoxycytidine to calculate thepercentage of methylation of deoxycytidine (MdC%) (32).Infusion protocol Participants were admitted to the GCRC on the evening before theinfusion protocol and consumed no food or drinks, except water, be- tween 2100 and the ﬁrst blood draw.On the morning of the infusion, a catheter was inserted in the antecubital vein of each arm, 1 for the tracerinfusion and 1 for blood collection.
Fasting blood samples were taken 2 h before infusion (at ;0700) for measurement of plasma PLP , serum folate and vitamin B-12, and plasma amino acid concentrations. Infusions wereinitiated at ;0900 with a 5-min, ;20-mL priming dose that delivered 9.26mmol/kg of [1,2- 13C2]glycine, 1.87 mmol/kg of [5,5,5-2H3]leucine, and 2.15 mmol/kg of NaH13CO 3.The 9-h constant infusion followed immediately after the priming dose and delivered ;20 mL infusion solution/h that contained 9.26 mmol/kg [1,2-13C2]glycine and 1.87 mmol/kg [5,5,5-2H3]leucine.Blood samples were taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.5, and 9 h of the infusion.They were placed immediately on ice and werecentrifuged within 15 min after the blood draw (1500 3g; 10 min at 4/C176C).Plasma was stored in microcentrifuge tubes at 280/C176C.Breath samples were collected into Exetainer tubes at times 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h of infusion to measure 13CO 2production.
Measurements of the VCO 2were conducted at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h of infusion. The participants received a nutritive formula hourly starting 2 h before infusion to maintain a fed state (30).This formula provided a balancedcomposition of amino acids at a rate based on requirements of 0.8 gprotein /C1kg 21/C1d21, which equals an hourly protein dose of ;0.03 g/kg with 5.23 kJ /C1kg21/C1d21for women and 5.44 kJ /C1kg21/C1d21for men.The formula further provided an adequate energy intake according to therequirements of 126 kJ /C1kg 21/C1d21for women and 130 kJ /C1kg21/C1d21for men.Blood samples were collected before the infusion (0-time) to deter- mine the natural isotopic abundance of monocyte DNA.Because monocytes appear ;1 d after synthesis in circulation and have a half- life of;2 d, blood samples were collected after 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 d ofeach infusion procedure for monocyte isolation and determination of DNA enrichment.
MdC% was determined in monocytes collected priorto each infusion (0-time) before and after vitamin B-6 restriction. Kinetic principles and analysis As reported previously (24), the combined use of [1,2- 13C2]glycine and [2H3]leucine allowed us to determine quantitative aspects of glycine metabolism, including its overall ﬂux and rates of decarboxylation, direct glycine-to-serine interconversion by SHMT (monitored by the formation of [13C2]serine), and the contribution of glycine-derived 1-carbon units as 5,10-methyleneTHF in serine formation via SHMT.The latter is indicated by the formation of [ 13C1]serine, because the glycine tracer is decarboxylated and catabolized via the GCS whereas the original13C-labeled 2-carbon of glycine is transferred to THF to yield 5,10-methyleneTHF.[2H3]Leucine was included to evaluate any nutri- tional effects on protein turnover as indicated by leucine ﬂux (13,33).
Plateau enrichments (Ep) for all infused amino acid tracers were calculated as the mean of the isotopic enrichments for the ;1.5–9-h time points for the infused [13C2]glycine and [2H3]leucine tracers. Ep of all labeled metabolic products were determined by ﬁtting enrichment data to single exponential curves deﬁned by the equation E¼Efð12e2ktÞ; where E is the enrichment at time t (h), E fthe enrichment at inﬁnity (i.e.Ep), and k the rate constant (h21) from the ﬁtted curve (34).Data were ﬁt to a single exponential regression equation using the ‘‘exponential rise tomaximum’’ function of SigmaPlot 2002 (version 8.02; SPSS).Steady-state kinetics of amino acid tracers were calculated using standard equations (35), including correction for overestimation ofintracellular enrichment from plasma enrichment data (30,34,35), as discussed below.
The ﬂux of an amino acid is the rate of appearance of that amino acid from endogenous production (de novo synthesis andprotein breakdown), absorption, and the tracer infusion and is calcu-lated from the Ep of the corresponding amino acid tracer. Speciﬁcally, the ﬂux (Q) of leucine (Q Leu) in the plasma pool is calculated as: QLeu¼ILeu/C1½ ðELeuÞ=ðEpLeuÞ21/C138; where I Leuis the [2H3]leucine infusion rate, E Leuis the enrichment of the [2H3]leucine tracer, and Ep Leuis the Ep of [2H3]leucine in plasma.The Ep of plasma leucine was not corrected for overestimation of intracellularenrichment, consistent with previous studies using leucine ﬂux as a relative indicator of protein turnover (13,33,36).Glycine Q (Q Gly) was calculated from plasma [13C2]glycine en- richment after correcting for the difference between the intracellularand plasma [ 13C2]glycine enrichment.
This prediction of intracellular [13C2]glycine enrichment (Ep’ Gly) was accomplished by multiplying the observed plasma [13C2]glycine enrichment by a correction factor of 0.4 derived from previous glycine tracer infusion studies in humans (37,38). QGly¼IGly/C1½ ðEGlyÞ=ðEp0 GlyÞ21/C138: The ﬂux values for labeled metabolic products, i.e.serine M 11 and serine M 12, were estimated by assuming a serine Q (Q Ser) of 271 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21at normal vitamin B-6 status and Q Ser ¼281 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21at marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency (13).QSer M11¼QSer/C1EpSer M11: The synthesis rates of metabolic products derived from the infused tracers were calculated from the ﬂux and the Ep of the infused tracerafter correction for intracellular isotopic dilution (13).
The rate of serine M11 synthesis, which was indicative of serine synthesis using a glycine- derived 1-carbon unit, was thus calculated as: Q Gly~SerM11¼QSer M11=Ep0 Gly: The rate of serine M 12 synthesis, reﬂecting direct conversion of glycine to serine, was calculated in analogous fashion. The rate of production of13CO 2served as a measure of the whole- body rate of decarboxylation of the glycine tracer.This was measured instandard fashion as in amino acid oxidation studies (30,39).In this procedure, the rate of 13CO 2release (V13CO 2, in units of mmol /C1h21/C1kg21 454 Lamers et al.body weight) and the rate of glycine catabolism via decarboxylation (CGly)(mmol /C1h21/C1kg21body weight) were calculated as follows: V13CO 2¼E13CO 2/C1VCO 2=0:81/C11=W; where E13CO 2is breath13CO 2enrichment plateau and 0.81 is the assumed fraction of CO 2release from the body pool of bicarbonate and W is body weight (39).
CGly¼V13CO 2/C1½ ð1=Ep0 GlyÞ2ð1=EiGlyÞ/C138; where Ep #Glyis the Ep of plasma [13C2]glycine corrected for intracellular overestimation and Ei Glyis the enrichment of the infused glycine tracer. The fraction of glycine ﬂux occurring via glycine decarboxylation was calculated as FGCS ¼CGly=QGly: The area under the curve (AUC) of nucleoside enrichment over time (infusion day until d 4 postinfusion, i.e.over 5 d) was determined using thetrapezoidal method to compare the rate of glycine and 1-carbon incorpo- ration in nucleoside synthesis before and after vitamin B-6 restriction.The maximum enrichment (E max) also is reported for each deoxynucleoside.Statistical analysis In all tracer measurements, isotopic enrichments are expressed as ratio of labeled:nonlabeled isotopomers after correction for the natural abun-dance of stable isotopes.The study was designed based on power calculations assuming variance equivalent to that observed in previous studies of homocysteine remethylation (13).
The power of the study was.80% for detecting a difference of .25% in measured ﬂuxes with 14 participants with an assumed SD of 25–30%. All data were presented as means 6SEM.An unpaired ttest was performed to determine differences in baseline characteristics between men and women.A pairedttest was used for assessment of differences between normal vitamin B-6 status and marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency.Two-factor ANOVA was performed to determine interactions between kinetic measurements and SNP.Data were analyzed using Microsoft Ofﬁce Excel 2007, SigmaStat3.0, and SPSS 16.0.Results Nutritional status and baseline characteristics.The 13 par- ticipants who completed the intervention had normal nutritional status for vitamin B-6, folate, and vitamin B-12 at baseline (Table 1 ).
Genetic polymorphism analysis (Table 1) that was conducted to facilitate possible inferences regarding any observed atypical kinetic patterns or metabolic proﬁles showed genotype distributions consistent with those reported previously (40). Plasma PLP, amino acid concentrations, and monocyte DNA methylation.After 28 d of dietary vitamin B-6 restriction, the plasma PLP concentration decreased into the range of mar-ginal deﬁciency (20–30 nmol/L) from 55 64 nmol/L to 23 61 nmol/L ( P,0.001), with a ﬁnal range of 18–29 nmol/L ( Table 2 ).During the 28-d period of vitamin B-6 restriction, the com-pliance of participants was monitored weekly by measuring plasma PLP concentrations.Marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency was reached after 22 62 d.Serum folate and plasma total homocysteine concentrations did not change from vitamin B-6restriction.Serum vitamin B-12 concentrations decreased ( P, 0.01) but remained in the normal range.
Plasma glycine ( P, 0.01) and cystathionine ( P,0.001) concentrations increased, whereas plasma serine, cysteine, and methionine concentrations remained constant. Monocyte DNA showed a trend toward lower MdC% after vitamin B-6 restriction ( P¼0.09).In vivo amino acid kinetics.Primed, constant infusion with 9.26 mmol /C1kg 21/C1h21[13C2]glycine and 1.87 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21 [2H3]leucine yielded quantiﬁable time course plots of plasmaenrichment of the infused stable isotope-labeled amino acids and the glycine-derived metabolic products for all participants ( Fig.1).The whole-body leucine ﬂux (106 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21) and glycine ﬂux (445–450 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21) did not change as a function of vitamin B-6 restriction ( Table 3 ).The absence of a change in leucine ﬂux indicates that this level of vitamin B-6restriction did not alter the rate of protein turnover.
The total rate of serine synthesis via SHMT, as calculated from the appearance of [ 13C2]serine from infused [13C2]glycine, increased and comprised 41 61% and 47 62% of the whole- body glycine ﬂux before and after vitamin B-6 restriction, respectively ( P,0.05). The rate of SHMT-mediated serine synthesis using a glycine cleavage-derived 1-carbon unit (asreﬂected by a 13C-labeled 1-carbon unit coupled to an unlabeled glycine to yield [13C1]serine) constituted 51 64% and 45 67% of the total glycine-to-serine conversion before and after vitaminB-6 restriction, respectively.Under the conditions of this pro- tocol, the enrichment of [ 13C1]methionine (i.e.M 11, which reﬂected homocysteine remethylation with a glycine-derived 13C-methyl group) was typically below the limit of precise measurement ( ,0.2 mol % excess).
The rate of13CO 2release corresponded to total CO 2 generation in glycine catabolism at 163 611mmol /C1kg21/C1h21 before and 151 68mmol /C1kg21/C1h21after the vitamin B-6– restricted diet. This also indicated that the glycine-derived generation of CO 2, which we assumed to be primarily via the GCS, accounted for 37 62% of whole body glycine ﬂux during adequate vitamin B-6 status and for 34 62% at marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency.Labeling of monocyte DNA from glycine.

Vitamin B-6, glycine, and 1-carbon metabolism 455 enrichment in DNA from monocytes after infusion with [13C2]glycine to determine purine de novo synthesis.The AUC for dG M 12 and dA M 12 enrichment from direct incorpora- tion of glycine in purine synthesis did not change in response to vitamin B-6 restriction ( Table 4 ).The enrichment of dG M 11, dA M11, thymidylate M 11, and MdC M 11 that would be derived from the incorporation of a glycine-derived13C-1-carbon unit was below the detection limit.Kinetic consequences of genetic polymorphisms.No clear relationships were discerned between the measured ﬂuxes and the polymorphisms evaluated in view of the small number ofparticipants in this analysis.Because this study provided a direct measurement of SHMT ﬂux (i.e.
Q Gly~Ser M12) and the kinetic consequences of SHMT 1420C .T polymorphism had not been examined previously to our knowledge, we classiﬁed glycine-to-serine ﬂuxes by SHMT 1420C .T genotype. The glycine-to- serine synthesis rate before and after vitamin B-6 restriction was 19167 and 204 612 in participants with the SHMT 1420CC genotype ( n¼8), 162 617 and 198 616 in participants with the SHMT 1420CT genotype ( n¼4), and 179 and 239 in 1 participant with the SHMT 1420TT genotype.There was nosigniﬁcant interaction between genotypes and the glycine-to- serine synthesis rate.Discussion Vitamin B-6 and in vivo ﬂuxes of GCS, SHMT, and transsulfuration.We hypothesized that glycine cleavage would be reduced based on consistent increases in plasma and urinary glycine concentrations in vitamin B-6–restricted human partic-ipants (13,14), as also seen in this study (Table 2), and from analysis of tissues of vitamin B-6–depleted rats (10–12).
A study in vitamin B-6–depleted rats had signiﬁcantly lower 14CO 2 production after injection of [14C]glycine. In vitro studies using liver and kidney homogenates of vitamin B-6–depleted rats conﬁrmed decreased glycine decarboxylation and thus loweredmaximum velocity for GCS during vitamin B-6 deﬁciency (18,41).The quantitative importance of the mitochondrial GCSin glycine metabolism is illustrated by the fact that GCS accounted for more than one-third of whole-body glycine ﬂux under the conditions of this protocol at both normal vitamin B-6 status and marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency.Generation of 13CO 2 from the [13C2]glycine infusion was not signiﬁcantly lowered by dietary vitamin B-6 restriction.The qualitative change in glycine cleavage rate was variably affected by vitamin B-6 restriction.Using the SD of 29 mmol /C1kg 21/C1h21as the criterion of change, 3 of the 13 participants showed a decrease, 2 increased, and 8 exhibited no change in the rate of glycine cleavage.
The reduced plasma PLP and increased plasma glycine and cystathionine concentrations in these participants and in previ- ous human trials (13,14) and rat studies (10–12) indicate thatthis extent of dietary vitamin B-6 restriction (i.e. to the range of20–30 nmol/L plasma PLP) leads to functional changes in vitamin B-6–dependent metabolic processes.Plasma PLP and amino acid concentrations are reﬂective of their liver concentrations (11).Vitamin B-6 restriction induces cellular PLP depletion as demon- strated in human erythrocytes (25) and animal tissues (10– 12,17,18) and affects intracellular compartments indicated bylowered enzyme activity in both cytosolic and mitochondrial SHMT (11).
Cystathionine serves as a biomarker of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency because of the high susceptibility of cystathionineg-lyase to reduced vitamin B-6 status (10,42).TABLE 2 Plasma or serum PLP, folate, vitamin B-12, and amino acid concentrations of 1-carbon metabolismand relative extent of monocyte DNA methylation in healthy men and women at baseline and after 28 d of moderate vitamin B-6 restriction 1 Baseline Restricted B vitamins Plasma PLP , nmol/L 55642 3 61** Serum folate, nmol/L 31623 5 66 Serum vitamin B-12, pmol/L 379634 334 630* Amino acids in plasma Total homocysteine, mmol/L 6.760.3 6.9 60.4 Total cysteine, mmol/L 237633 237 629 Glycine, mmol/L 306620 339 618* Serine, mmol/L 96659 7 66 Methionine, mmol/L 29612 9 61 Cystathionine, nmol/L 9965 169 615** Methylation of deoxycytidine in monocyte DNA, MdC as % of total deoxycytidine4.4860.03 4.41 60.04 1Values are means 6SEM, n¼13. *Different from baseline, P,0.01; ** P,0.001 (paired ttest).

Values are means 6SEM, n¼13.456 Lamers et al.Dietary vitamin B-6 restriction did not alter whole-body glycine ﬂux or rate of glycine cleavage, which we suggest is due to a concurrent increase in tissue glycine concentration.TheMichaelis constant (K m) of glycine decarboxylase in the GCS is 6 mmol/L (43), which is much higher than the concentration of free glycine in tissues.The total free glycine concentration inhuman adult liver has been reported to be 2.48 mmol/g wet weight ( ;2.48 mmol/L) (44) with a predicted compartmen- talization of 0.83 mmol/L in cytosol and 1.86 mmol/L in mitochondria (45).
Michaelis-Menten principles predict that therate of mitochondrial glycine decarboxylation and concurrent generation of 5,10-methyleneTHF by the GCS would be a sensitive function of mitochondrial glycine concentration be-cause of the high glycine K mvalue for the GCS and compara- tively lower typical mitochondrial glycine concentration (i.e. [gly],, Km).Therefore, increases in tissue glycine in marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency would tend to counteract the effect of PLP depletion (and resulting reduction in maximum velocity) on glycine decarboxylase activity, thereby maintaining adequateglycine cleavage ﬂux well into the range of marginal vitamin B-6status.We also have shown that this marginal level of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency has little effect on in vivo ﬂux in SHMT-dependentgeneration of 1-carbon units from serine (13) despite ;40% reduction in SHMT activity measured in vitro in lymphocytes from the same human participants (13).
Also, vitamin B-6 re-striction in rats causes substantial reductions in rat liver SHMT activity assayed in vitro over a comparable stage of deﬁciency (11). Increases in tissue glycine concentration would tend tomaintain serine production during low vitamin B-6 status, whichis consistent with the increased ﬂux of serine synthesis from glycine observed here (Table 3).In the present study, we ex- amined SHMT ﬂux in the direction of glycine-to-serine synthe-sis, concurrent with the conversion of 5,10-methyleneTHF to THF.Our previous studies (13,33,42) employed protocols designed to examine serine as a source of 1-carbon units and,thus, examined consequences of the SHMT reaction in the serine-to-glycine direction.Our calculation of serine synthesis rate in this protocol assumes a Q Serof 271 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21at normal vitamin B-6 status and 281 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21at marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency derived from a previous study (13).
We used this approach because a simultaneous determination ofserine and glycine ﬂux was not feasible within the design of thistracer protocol. Limitations of resources and limits imposed by blood sampling guidelines precluded the use of additional infusions that would be necessary for determination of Q Serin each participant before and after vitamin B-6 depletion.We recognize that individual variability is overlooked when using QSeras a constant in the calculation of glycine-to-serine kinetics.Also, the Q Serdetermined in the Davis et al.study (13) was measured in participants fed an amino acid-free but energy- adequate nutritive formula, whereas the nutritive formula in thepresent study provided hourly amino acids, including 19.4 mmol /C1kg 21/C1h21leucine, 10.4 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21serine, and 9.4 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21glycine.
The provision of dietary amino acids in the present study accelerated amino acid turnover as reﬂected bythe whole-body leucine ﬂux (106 64mmol /C1kg 21/C1h21) compared with 80 63mmol /C1kg21/C1h21reported by Davis et al. (13).The variability of response in participants fed a protein-free or aminoacid-containing formula, however, did not change, as shown by the SEM of both studies, which suggests that interindividual differences were negligible or that any such differences did notcomplicate out kinetic analysis with participants in the fed state.
The estimate of whole-body glycine ﬂux in the present study (448620mmol /C1kg 21/C1h21) is consistent with a report (46) ofTABLE 3 Plasma isotopic Ep of stable isotope-labeled amino acids and their metabolic products and the corresponding whole-body ﬂux values in healthy men and women at baseline and after 28 dof moderate vitamin B-6 restriction 1 Ep Whole-body Q Baseline Restricted Baseline Restricted mol % excess mmol/C1kg21/C1h21 Infused amino acids Qinfused AA [2H3]leucine 1.75 60.06 1.80 60.09 106 642106672 [13C2]glycine 5.21 60.29 5.17 60.19 448 62034466163 Metabolic products QGly~Ser M1x [13C1]serine (Ser M 11) 0.70 60.06 0.67 60.05 93 69491664 [13C2]serine (Ser M 12) 1.37 60.05 1.50 60.08 182 675205695* QGly~CO2 13CO2 0.04660.002 0.043 60.004 163 6116151686 1Values are means 6SEM, n¼13. *Different from baseline, P¼0.02 (paired ttest).2QLeu.3QGly.4Serine synthesis via SHMT using a glycine-derived 1-carbon unit.5Serine synthesis from glycine via SHMT.

We acknowledge a potential underestimation of the serine synthesis rate in the present study. This would imply an even higher contribution of serine synthesis to whole-body glycine ﬂux.No studies, to our knowl-edge, have so far investigated whole body Q Serin the fed state.This tracer protocol was performed in participants in the fed state to accelerate pathways by substrate loads (30), but hor-monal variations would likely also inﬂuence these pathways.For example, insulin causes increased transsulfuration by transcrip- tionally upregulating cystathionine b-synthase production (47), whereas glucagon activates GCS by a phosphorylation-mediated,cell-signaling mechanism (48,49).The in vivo relationship of hormonal status and metabolic ﬂuxes is poorly understood, especially as inﬂuenced by vitamin B-6 status.We used measurements of breath 13CO 2enrichment to quantify the glycine cleavage rate.
However,13CO 2might be generated by several processes other than the glycine decar-boxylase activity of the GCS after [ 13C2]glycine infusion, as discussed previously (24).13CO 2also could have been formed from both carbons of [13C2]glycine through pathways of folate or pyruvate metabolism in addition to glycine decarboxylationin the GCS. The 2-carbon of glycine is transferred on THF, forming 5,10-methyleneTHF in the GCS.5,10-MethyleneTHF can be reduced to 10-formylTHF and 10-formylTHF dehydro-genase converts 10-formylTHF to THF and CO 2(29).The reaction catalyzed by 10-formylTHF dehydrogenase might have contributed partially to13CO 2formation after [13C2]glycine infusion.Pyruvate metabolism also can yield CO 2formation indirectly from glycine.After conversion of glycine to serine, serine is transformed to pyruvate by the vitamin B-6–dependentserine dehydratase.Pyruvate can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle either as oxaloacetate or acetyl-CoA.
The decarboxylation of pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase to acetyl-CoA and CO 2 also could contribute to13CO 2formation in this protocol. However, 10-formylTHF dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogen- ase, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle are further downstream in the metabolism where labeling of compounds becomes in-creasingly diluted.Moreover, we propose that CO 2formation through the GCS is likely to be quantitatively greater than CO 2 generation in the folate or pyruvate metabolism, because glycine is the direct substrate for GCS.Quantitative aspects of glycine metabolism.For each glycine molecule processed, the GCS produces 1 molecule of 5,10-methyleneTHF and CO 2.The high rate of glycine cleavage and, thus, 5,10-methyleneTHF production (163 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21 in normal vitamin B-6 status and 151 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21in marginal deﬁciency), greatly exceeds the demand for 1-carbon units in remethylation and transmethylation processes.
As reported earlier, total homocysteine remethylation was notimpaired by vitamin B-6 restriction (7.0 mmol /C1kg 21/C1h21at normal vitamin B-6 status, 6.4 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21at marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency) (13). In the present study, the incorpo-ration of GCS-derived 5,10-methyleneTHF accounted for 45% (;92mmol /C1kg 21/C1h21) of serine synthesis.This implies that ;60% of GCS-derived 1-carbon units enter serine synthesis while the other 40% enter other aspects of 1-carbon metabolism,including nucleoside synthesis, homocysteine remethylation, and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reactions.In yeast experiments, GCS-yielded 5,10-methyleneTHF was primarilyutilized to synthesize serine (50).As shown in mathematicalmodeling, glycine and serine are major sources of 1-carbon units released by GCS and SHMT.Model predictions of a very high ﬂux of the GCS (glycine decarboxylase) reaction (45) are consistent with the observations of this study.
Our previousstable isotopic studies showed that serine is the major 1-carbon donor for remethylation reactions (29). The high serine synthesis rate (;182mmol /C1kg 21/C1h21) observed here exceeds the demand of 1-carbon units for remethylation and transmethylation pro- cesses (;7mmol /C1kg21/C1h21) (13).Mitochondrial serine production in humans has been shown to support gluconeogenesis (45).Thehigh rate of whole-body production of 5,10-methyleneTHF and serine in this study would contribute to glucose formation as well as nucleoside synthesis.Glycine in nucleoside synthesis.Quinlivan et al.(23) demonstrated with infusion of [3- 13C]serine and [13C5]methio- nine the feasibility of using monocyte DNA analysis as a tool forexamining nutritional and genetic variables affecting synthesis of the deoxynucleotide precursors.In that study (23), the peak enrichment of deoxynucleosides in monocyte DNA occurred at3 d postinfusion.
The AUC for the appearance of doubly labeled (M12) dG and dA in monocyte DNA after [ 13C2]glycine infusion reﬂects relative rates of de novo purine synthesis,monocyte synthesis, and turnover. The absence of impairment ofvitamin B-6 restriction on dA and dG M 12 AUC values indicates that these processes were not affected by this level of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency.We did note a signiﬁcant decrease in theE maxof dG M 12 but not of its AUC.However, this result needs careful interpretation, because 11 of 13 participants showed Emaxof dG M 12 at the last time point of blood sampling, i.e.4 d postinfusion and the full time course could not be evaluated.However, we anticipate no further increase in purine enrichment after 4 d postinfusion.The fact that, with [13C2]glycine infusion in the present study, no peak was observed at 3 d postinfusion might indicate that the turnover of the precursor pool of bone marrow glycine is slower than the turnover of the 1-carbondonors serine and methionine (23).
De novo synthesis accountsfor 90% of nucleotide generation (51,52). Mathematical mod- eling suggests the rates of purine and pyrimidine synthesis are constant even when extracellular glycine or serine concen-trations are altered.This is due to rebalancing of glycine and serine pools by the reversible reaction of SHMT (45,50).The incorporation of 1-carbon units into purines through the 10-formylTHF-dependent transformylase reactions could not be detected, because the M 11 enrichments of dA and dG were below the detection limit.Baggott et al.(22) observed incorpo-ration of glycine-derived, 1-carbon units in purine synthesis after a much larger oral dose of [2- 13C1]glycine.In the present study, dietary vitamin B-6 restriction did not change whole-bodyglycine ﬂux or plasma glycine enrichment, and thus tissueenrichment, leading us to the assumption that nucleoside synthesis is not altered in marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency.Amino acid ﬂux.
Marginal vitamin B-6 restriction did not affect whole-body glycine or leucine ﬂux. The whole body glycine ﬂux in these men and women was 448 mmol /C1kg 21/C1h21 and 446 mmol /C1kg21/C1h21at normal vitamin B-6 status and at marginal vitamin B-6 deﬁciency.The major contributor to whole-body glycine ﬂux is whole-body protein breakdown (53).The whole-body glycine ﬂux can be maintained by an increasedendogenous glycine synthesis at low but adequate protein intake (53).We have not examined the in vivo kinetics of glycine transamination by serine-pyruvate/alanine-glyoxylate amino-transferase.Further pathways utilizing glycine are the formation 458 Lamers et al.of serine, shown here to be ;40% of glycine ﬂux, and glutathi- one, protein synthesis, and gluconeogenesis.Intracellular dilu- tion of glycine enrichment results from glyoxylate metabolism, de novo synthesis, protein degradation, and interconversion fromserine.
The Q Leu, an essential amino acid, remained constant and indicated that this level of vitamin B-6 restriction did not alter whole-body protein turnover. In conclusion, this study has yielded novel information about several aspects of human glycine and serine metabolism, the role of glycine as a major source of 5,10-methyleneTHF for folate-dependent 1-carbon metabolism, and the contribution of glycine in nucleoside synthesis.Within the statistical power of our study, we have demonstrated the surprising resiliency of these processesto low vitamin B-6 intake, presumably through a compensatoryeffect of increasing substrate concentration.The mechanism by which this marginal level of vitamin B-6 deﬁciency is associated with risk of chronic disease remains to be clariﬁed.Literature Cited 1.Kikuchi G.The glycine cleavage system: composition, reaction mechanism, and physiological signiﬁcance.Mol Cell Biochem.1973;1:169–87.2.Davis CD, Uthus EO.
