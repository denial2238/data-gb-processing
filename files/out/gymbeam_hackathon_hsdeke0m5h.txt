We compare a surface-driven, model-based deformation correction method to a clinically relevant rigid registration approach within the application of image-guided microwave ablation for the purpose of dem- onstrating improved localization and antenna placement in a deformable hepatic phantom. Furthermore, we present preliminary computational modeling of microwave ablation integrated within the navigational environ- ment to lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive procedural planning and guidance framework.To achieve this, we employ a simple, retrospective model of microwave ablation after registration, which allows a preliminary evaluation of the combined therapeutic and navigational framework.
When driving registrations with full organ surface data (i.e., as could be available in a percutaneous procedure suite), the deformation correction method improved average ablation antenna registration error by 58.9% compared to rigid registration (i.e., 2.5/C61.1mm, 5.6/C62.3mm of average target error for corrected and rigid registration, respectively) and on average improved volumetric overlap between the modeled and ground-truth ablation zones from 67.0/C611.8%to85.6/C65.0%for rigid and corrected, respectively. Furthermore, when using sparse-surface data (i.e., as is available in an open surgical procedure), the deformation correction improved registration error by 38.3% and volumetric overlap from 64.8/C612.4%to77.1/C68.0%for rigid and corrected, respectively.
We demonstrate, in an initial phantom experi- ment, enhanced navigation in image-guided hepatic ablation procedures and identify a clear multiphysics pathway toward a more comprehensive thermal dose planning and deformation-corrected guidance framework. ©2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) [DOI: 10.1117/1.JMI.6.2.025007 ] Keywords: deformation; image-guided surgery; microwave ablation; liver; registration.Paper 18283R received Dec.28, 2018; accepted for publication Apr.23, 2019; published online May 20, 2019.
1 Introduction 1.1 Clinical Factors Loco-regional therapies, such as thermal ablation, have received increased indications for use in neoadjuvant roles, ablation- assisted resection, and for the treatment of unresectable hepatic malignancies.1–8While radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most common ablative therapy used clinically, it has presented a relatively high local recurrence rate (12% to 39%) when com- pared to microwave ablation (MWA) (6% to 8.8%).1–5In addi- tion, in matched cohort studies, patients receiving MWAsaw improved survival compared to those receiving RFA. 2,3 Furthermore, MWA has received considerable interest due to its larger spatial extent of power deposition, penetration throughcharred tissues, and ability to ablate up to and around large vessels.
2,3,7Due to advances in neoadjuvant care, therapeutic options, and improved patient selection criteria, the long-termsurvival of patients receiving ablation treatments for hepatic colorectal cancer metastases has improved significantly in recent years 3,6,8and, in smaller tumors ( ≤3c m ), is comparable to the clinical standard of surgical resection that can offer 5-yearsurvival of 44% to 50% in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. 9 As the procedural process inherently targets internal struc- tures, the efficacy of ablation is highly reliant on accurate locali- zation and targeting of these subsurface lesions during aprocedure, as inaccurate delivery can lead to incomplete treat- ment and local recurrence.10As such, ablations are generally performed using image-guidance [e.g., intraoperative ultrasoundimaging (iUS) or computed tomography (CT)] to assist in tumor localization and probe placement.
However, with these methods, real-time localization, monitoring, and assessment are extremelylimited. Further, these factors are delivery-mode dependent, as hepatic tumor ablation can be performed percutaneously, lapa- roscopically, or in open surgery.Regarding clinical standards for ablation procedural plan- ning, geometric estimates of expected ablation zone size and shape are provided by device manufacturers based on experi- mental measurements taken from ex vivo animal tissue.As such, these predictions ignore patient-specific anatomical and physiological variation, potential tissue heterogeneity, tissue perfusion, and differences in disease state that may be present.Accordingly, such estimates have been observed to often over- predict size and result in more homogeneous shapes when com- pared to clinical ablation outcomes.
11,12 1.2 Localization and Therapy Guidance Recent applications for image-guided ablation procedures have reported enhanced localization of tumors and improved accu- racy of ablation antenna placement in open13–16and laparo- scopic procedures.17–20These methods have employed a variety of electromagnetic (EM) tracking, optical tracking, and registra-tion methods to provide enhanced image-guidance. However, to *Address all correspondence to Jarrod A.Collins, E-mail: jarrod.a.collins@ vanderbilt.edu 2329-4302/2019/$25.00 © 2019 SPIE Journal of Medical Imaging 025007-1 Apr –Jun 2019 Vol.6(2)Journal of Medical Imaging 6(2), 025007 (Apr –Jun 2019) date, image-guided ablation methods providing image-to-physi- cal registration in open and laparoscopic settings have been lim-ited to rigid registration approaches, which neglect soft-tissue deformations that occur from organ mobilization during these procedures and can cause substantial registration error.
21 EM-tracking, combined with iUS methods, attempts to circum- vent this problem by tracking the real-time position of surgical tools in relation to real-time iUS imaging. However, the EM-iUSapproach has limited information, can suffer from poor contrast,and loses efficacy when targeting lesions in cirrhotic patients or in those with chemotherapy-induced hyper-echogenicity associ- ated with steatosis, both of which can compromise ultrasoundlesion visualization.22,23 Several model-based soft-tissue deformation correction approaches have been presented in the literature for deformableimage registration for hepatic resection.For example, Lange et al.24published an algorithm using thin-plate splines to deform preoperatively acquired vessels to intraoperative vesselsacquired from tracked iUS.Hu et al.25presented a method using coherent point drift to nonrigidly register vessel landmarks, such as bifurcations.
Alternatively, other approaches have concen- trated on achieving surface-based deformation correction meth-ods. Rucker et al.26described an inverse approach that optimizes boundary conditions described by a parameterized posterior dis- placement field, based on the reality of organ deformation dur-ing operative mobilization, to minimize the residual error between the intraoperatively collected anterior surface digitiza- tion and the deformed model surface.More recently, Heiselmanet al.27expanded upon the work of Rucker et al.by reformu- lating the application of boundary conditions to a control point strategy, which allows for multiple independent support surfacesto be designated.Both surface-based methods have demon-strated effective correction of soft-tissue deformation in phan- tom and clinical applications for hepatic resection.
26–30 With respect to thermal dose guidance, predictive, biophysi- cal modeling of MWA presents a strong alternative to the manu- facturer-provided estimates of ablation outcome by utilizing numerical approaches to solve the physical governing equationsdefining energy deposition and heat transfer. Other direct ther- mographic measurement strategies such as MR 31and US32ther- mography are on the horizon, but these also have high technicaland economic hurdles for practical use in the operating room orinterventional suite.A computational approach driven by sparse data would certainly have some advantages.Recent modeling work has focused on treating tissue properties as a functionof temperature.33–35These models were generally characterized within ex vivo animal tissue or simulation.
Additional work is still needed to understand the variations that can presentbetween patients due to differences in tissue properties 32–35 related to perfusion36–40or disease state (e.g., steatosis or cirrhosis41,42). Clearly, there is further need for prospective MWA modeling approaches.In addition, however, with respect to model-based solutions to guidance, there is certainly need of studying the power of integrating advanced surgical navigationmethods with predictive MWA modeling in the delivery of abla-tion planning, delivery, and execution.1.3 Impact for Surgical Open and Laparoscopic Procedures When specifically considering the open and laparoscopic set- tings, as is the primary focus of this paper, advanced navigationapproaches have been used to create a spatial mapping betweensurgical instrumentation and imaging data to improve visualiza- tion of anatomical structures.
Based on our existing image-guid-ance work for surgical resection, 26–30the work here uses a hepatic deformation phantom setup designed to evaluate the accuracy of ablation probe localization when using the deforma-tion correction method of Heiselman et al. 27as compared to a clinically relevant rigid registration method.43With respect to presentation, only a portion of the anterior surface of theliver is available for organ-to-organ registration and assumesdeformation conditions that are associated with surgical pack- ing, i.e., the presented liver for surgery is first mobilized from the ligamenture, and then immobilized with surgical pack-ing placed beneath the posterior surface of the organ.Careful attention has been paid such that the deformation patterns mimic those found in a previous clinical study of open resectionby Clements et al.
44Finally, as the impact of the work is con- sidered, the performance evaluation clearly speaks to MWA ablation localization and prediction under conditions in openand laparoscopic surgery. 1.4 Impact for Percutaneous Procedures Percutaneous image-guided ablation has become a powerful option in liver cancer patients not eligible for resection orwaiting for transplant.45,46Due to its low complication rate, good efficacy, and minimally invasive nature, it is a common approach to control and manage liver cancer progression.However, when compared to resection or ablation in the open surgical setting, ablation site recurrence is quite high.47 Improving percutaneous ablative procedures is an important need.In this work, while mock organ presentations that correlate with percutaneous delivery are not specifically considered, the framework was engaged in the context of organ-to-organdeformable registration with full liver surface availability.
This would resemble conditions where x-ray-based technologies are being utilized for guidance such as with C-arm cone beamcomputed tomography (CBCT) systems. CBCT guidance forpercutaneous ablation has shown improved effectiveness and safety in multiple studies.48–53However, studies evaluating image registration with CBCT for ablative treatment in theliver are limited and even more so with respect to the impact of deformations.50–53As a result, the experimental design herein was employed to establish results in the case where completeliver surface digitization is available.Yet, it is acknowledged that the percutaneous workflow, mode of soft-tissue deforma- tion, and the dynamic nature of percutaneous intervention arenot addressed.2 Methods 2.1 Overview of Validation Study In this study, a deformable hepatic phantom constructed of albu- min suspended in agar was treated with 915 MHz MWA (ST antenna, Perseon, Salt Lake City, Utah) creating a visible abla-tion lesion.
The ablated phantom was imaged using T 2-weighted MRI, from which the phantom boundary, ablation zone, antenna tip, and antenna insertion point were segmented in the initial“predeformation ”pose of the phantom. Next, support blocks were inserted beneath the phantom to change the underlying posterior support surface shape as well as to shift the ablation(e.g., similar to deformations observed in an open surgicalsetting 26,44).The phantom was then reimaged in this Journal of Medical Imaging 025007-2 Apr –Jun 2019 Vol.6(2)Collins et al.: Multiphysics modeling toward enhanced guidance in hepatic microwave...“postdeformation ”state, providing the same information as before but in this new deformed pose.This two-step processeffectively provided all procedural delivery information and ablation physical outcomes “before ”and “after ”a deforming event.
Image-to-physical registration was then performed by registering the initial predeformation image to the mock full-/ sparse-surface digitization of the organ generated from the post-deformation imaging data. This experimental setup allowed theablation information to effectively be used as a geometric target for registration assessment.In addition, a simple, retrospective model of the MWA procedure (i.e., a model of antenna powerdeposition and thermal distribution) was simulated in the pre- deformation pose given the antenna location segmented from MRI.We should note that the retrospective model was opti-mized to match the ablation measured.
This was done to estab- lish a baseline of the best possible outcome of model-to-physical ablation domain comparison as model error is inevitable.Together, these experiments allow the initial investigation ofhow well a computationally modeled, deformation-corrected ablation prediction performed versus the ground truth ablation extent and location (i.e., the evaluation of a model-based thera-peutic and localization system). The experiment included a total of three ablations present in eight registration scenarios.To our knowledge, this combined evaluation is a unique contribution tothe literature.2.2 Summary of Image-to-Physical Registration Methods Two methods of image-to-physical registration were evaluated in this study: a conventional rigid registration and a nonrigidregistration approach that corrects for deformation.Rigid regis- tration methods are currently the standard method used in com- mercial navigation systems.
These methods are very fast, anessential requirement in the OR, but they rely on the assumption that the transformation from image-to-physical space is purely rigid and therefore could have poor behavior when deformationis present. The rigid registration method used in this study iter-atively seeks to align the anterior organ surface and salient ana- tomical features in the predeformation image to the analogous sparse-surface and feature data designated in physical space.These data are synthesized from the postdeformation image data in this experiment, although in a typical clinical case, the sparse-surface and feature data would be collected by thephysician in the operating room with an optically tracked stylus.Typical data collection involves the acquisition of three-dimen- sional (3-D) points over the anterior liver surface and specificfeatures (falciform, round ligament, and inferior ridges).
Tomimic the quality of data available in a clinical setting, a sparse clinical collection pattern was taken of the anterior liver phan- tom surface in its postdeformation state. We should note that thisdistribution was extracted from the image volume data rather than acquired from conventional image-guidance instrumenta- tion (details are in Sec.2.7).With respect to the details of the rigid registration, these are described by Clements et al.43 and their clinical efficacy have been reported in subsequentwork.26–30 To better account for intraoperative deformations in the image alignment, the second method of registration evaluated in this study was a nonrigid, model-based approach designedto account for soft-tissue deformations.This deformable regis-tration method seeks to minimize the difference between thesurface generated from the segmented image volume of the preoperative image and the sparse anterior surface data acquiredin the mock intraoperative physical space.
Briefly, the technique manipulates a set of surface control points distributed across the model surface in areas of anticipated deformation.Perturbations of the control points provide a precomputed dis- tribution of volumetric displacements to the biomechanical model. Intraprocedurally, optimization ensues iteratively withan active boundary condition reconstruction with simultaneousrigid parameter update until the preoperative organ shape matches the intraoperative counterpart.Optimization is per- formed using the Levenberg –Marquardt algorithm.The details of this method have been reported by Heiselman et al.27 2.3 Microwave Ablation Model We utilize a two-dimensional axially symmetric computational model developed within COMSOL Multiphysics (COMSOLInc, Burlington, Massachusetts) and Matlab 2017b (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts) to retrospectively model MWA with the 915-MHz Perseon short-tip (ST) antennawithin an agar-albumin phantom.
These retrospective models were then registered to their known locations in image space, simulating a preoperatively determined procedural plan.Following image-to-physical registration, we can then evaluate the accuracy of the registered ablation model when compared to the ground-truth ablation zone. With respect to the biophysics, the electromagnetic wave equation was implemented to describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the mock soft-tissue phantom: EQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e001;326;425ð∇2þω2μεcÞE⇀ ¼0; (1) where ω(rad/s) is the angular frequency of the electromagnetic wave, μ(H/m) is the permeability, εcis the complex permittivity, andE⇀ (V/m) is the electric field strength.
Penne ’s bioheat trans- fer equation was employed to describe the temperature evolution and heat transfer: EQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e002;326;334ρc∂T ∂t¼∇·k∇TþQ−Qp; (2) where ρ(kg∕m3) is the mass density, c(J∕kg·K) is the specific heat capacity, k(W∕m·K) is the thermal conductivity, T(K) is the instantaneous temperature, Q(W∕m3) is the heat generation, andQp(W∕m3) is the heat loss due to perfusion. Perfusion was not implemented within the phantom and as a result wasexcluded from the model.Heat generation within the phantom, Q, was modeled as a function of the rate of microwave energy absorption, as such: EQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e003;326;205Q¼1 2σkEk2; (3) where σ(S/m) is the electrical conductivity.An electromagnetic wave transparent boundary condition was applied at the outer edges of the modeling domain to pro- hibit microwave reflection: EQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e004;326;119n⇀×ð∇×E⇀ Þ−jkn⇀×ðE⇀ ×n⇀Þ¼0; (4) where n⇀is the direction normal to the boundary and kis the wave number.
The antenna is modeled as a conventional Journal of Medical Imaging 025007-3 Apr –Jun 2019 Vol. 6(2)Collins et al.: Multiphysics modeling toward enhanced guidance in hepatic microwave...conductive core surrounded by dielectric material, catheter, with ring-shaped slot cut on the outer conductor.Conductive materialis not specifically realized but represented by the boundarycondition: EQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e005;63;708n⇀×E⇀ ¼0: (5) The microwave source itself is modeled as a port boundary condition, which relates the field to the square root of the time average power flow in the cable and is adopted from Ref.54.This antenna model was consistent with observed performance;however, exact industry specifications were not available.External boundaries were set to a fixed temperature (room temperature).
Internal boundaries between the phantom andablation antenna simulated saline cooling within the antenna with a convective heat flux condition: EQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e006;63;573n⇀·ð−k∇TÞ¼h·ðT−TextÞ; (6) where n⇀is the normal vector to the element, k(W∕m·K) is the thermal conductivity, h(W∕m2·K) is the heat transfer coeffi- cient, T(K) is the temperature, and Textis the saline temperature (room temperature). To simulate biological ablation, a mock cell necrosis was approximated as a function of protein denaturation and wasestimated at each time step by the Arrhenius damage integral: EQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e007;63;462α¼Zt 0Aexp/C20 −Ea RTðtÞ/C21 dt; (7) where αis the degree of damage at a given time, A(1/s) is a frequency factor, Ea(J/mol) is the activation energy required to denature the protein within the phantom, R(J∕mol·K)i s the universal gas constant, and TðtÞ(K) is the phantom temper- ature history.
The estimated fraction of denatured protein wasthen calculated as EQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e008;63;338θd¼1−e−α: (8) 2.4 Phantom Property Reconstruction The model conveyed in Sec. 2.3was retrospectively fit to ground truth data from mock gross pathology of our phantomfrom which ablation extent could be determined.The computa-tional model fitting framework is based on a nonlinear optimi- zation approach where a parameter set defining the dielectric and thermal properties of the phantom domain within the finiteelement model is iteratively chosen to maximize the overlapbetween the model-predicted and observed ablation zones: EQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e009;63;199P¼½σ;ε;k ;c/C138; (9) where σ,ε,k, and care the electrical conductivity, relative per- mittivity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat capacity ofphantom, respectively.
The objective function is defined bythe degree of overlap between the model-predicted and observedablation zones as such EQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e010;63;113Ω¼1−NTP NTPþNFPþNFN; (10)whereΩsignifies the ratio of the intersection and union of the model-predicted and observed ablation zones. For this frame-work, we use the Nelder –Mead downhill simplex method to optimize the parameter set [Eq.( 9)] by minimizing the objective function [Eq.( 10)].The Nelder –Mead algorithm is a heuristic search approach used to solve nonlinear optimization problems without requiring derivative information.2.5 Agar-Albumin Hepatic Deformation Phantom The deformable hepatic phantom used in this study consisted of a combination of purified water, 1.5 wt.% agar-agar powder(Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts), and 50 wt.% liquid egg whites (Break Free Liquid Egg Whites, The Kroger Company, Cincinnati, Ohio).
Liquid egg whites wereused to produce a permanent visual history of the thermalinduced ablation lesion, similar in nature to the ablation lesions that form in tissue. Egg whites contain around 10% ovalbumin protein dissolved in 90% water with nearly no carbohydrate orfat content.Thermal denaturing of the ovalbumin protein leads to aggregation, which causes optical scattering and a large reduction in the T 2relaxation coefficient of the material.The resulting ablation lesions were imaged using T2-weighted MRI and visually observed with mock gross pathology by sec- tioning the phantom along the midline of the ablation antennaand backlighting the section [as seen in Figs.1(b) and1(c)].To create the phantom, powdered agar-agar was thoroughly mixed with water and heated to boiling on a hot plate whilebeing continuously stirred to produce a 1.5% agar gel.The sol-ution was then cooled to < 60°Cwith continuous stirring before adding the liquid egg whites.
This cooling ensured that no pro- tein denatured prematurely. The mixture was then mixed for1 min and then poured into the phantom mold to allow the gel to set.A plaster negative derived from contrast-enhanced CT imaging of a patient liver was used as the phantom mold Fig.1 (a) Agar-albumin phantom liver in its predeformation state.MWA antenna is seen inserted into the right lobe.(b) Mock grosspathology of an ablation within the agar-albumin phantom.Theouter ablation contour, ablation antenna tip location, and ablationantenna shaft are clearly visible.(c) Slice from the T 2-weighted MRI of the ablation zone from which the outer ablation contour, abla- tion antenna tip location, and ablation antenna shaft were segmented.Journal of Medical Imaging 025007-4 Apr –Jun 2019 Vol.6(2)Collins et al.: Multiphysics modeling toward enhanced guidance in hepatic microwave...to produce a hepatic phantom with clinically relevant anatomical structure (Fig.1).
2.6 Applied Deformations The proposed modeling and registration framework was evalu- ated across a range of clinically relevant organ deformations. With respect to open surgery, deformations occur due to the introduction of packing material beneath and around theorgan following mobilization of the organ from surrounding anatomy.With respect to intervention, changes between diag- nostic and intraprocedural presentation incur shape change.To impose soft tissue deformations, silicone support blocks(roughly 20 to 30 mm thick) were inserted beneath varying areas of the phantom to simulate surgical packing for organ pre- sentation in the case of ablation under open surgical procedures.Figure 2provides an example of the extent of deformation induced in the phantom.In total, four unique applications of deformation were applied to the phantom.In case 1, supportmaterial was placed beneath the lateral superior right lobe, rais- ing the largest volume of the phantom.
In case 2, support material was added beneath both the lateral superior and inferiorright lobe, causing the right lobe to rise and rotate about the falciform ligament. In case 3, support material was inserted beneath the lateral inferior right lobe and the left lobe, causingthe medial area of the liver to sag.Finally, in case 4, supportmaterial was inserted beneath the lateral inferior right lobe, causing it to rise.It should be noted that the distribution of signed closest point differences is similar to those that havebeen measured in the literature.More specifically, in Ref.54, laser range data of the anterior surface were rigidly registered to the preoperative imaged counterpart and demonstrated thisperiodic distribution of signed closest point distances similar to Fig.2.In addition, this was also seen in the analysis by Heiselman et al.27for the laparoscopic configuration.
2.7 Data Collection T2-weighted MRI scans were acquired for each state of phantom deformation (i.e., one predeformation image set and fourpost-deformation image sets). 3-D models were generated from each set of images using ITK-SNAP.55Salient feature regions were manually designated from the surface of each model.To date, these image-to-physical registration methods have been clinically implemented using sparse digitizationsof the anterior organ surface attained intraoperatively.Within this study, we present and compare results following registration using (1) full-surface data, (2) sparse-surface data, and(3) resampled sparse-surface data using the resampling methodpresented by Collins et al.29 Sparse anterior surface data, akin to what would be available clinically, were generated using a method similar to the human-to-phantom data described by Collins et al.
29Briefly, sparse-sur- face data gathered from actual clinical cases (an IRB approved study at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Ref. 28) were rigidly registered to our phantom image volume in its deformed state.This was accomplished using the weighted salient feature registration method of Clements et al.43Once ini- tialized, an affine registration was performed to account for anydifferences in organ size between the clinical and phantom data.Next, the clinical surface data were projected to their closest points on the deformed phantom surface, resulting in uniquerealistic sparse anterior surface designations for each case.However, unlike the method of Collins et al., 29no additional noise was added to these synthesized sparse-surface data.Allsynthesized designations had an extent of organ coverage between 25% and 30%, which is within the range of typical clinical data acquisition.
27,56It should be noted that the above process could be performed in the reciprocal workflow allowing for a second set of novel conditions (i.e., treating the actual “postdeformation ”data as the preoperative organ state and the actual “predeformation ”data as the intraoperative organ state). In total, this created eight registration scenarios (the origi- nal four cases from Sec.2.6and the four reciprocal instances) for the results herein, each with an independent set of simulatedphysical space data to drive the registrations.2.8 Analysis Two methods of image-to-physical registration were compared in this study: (1) the salient feature weighted iterative closest point rigid registration method by Clements et al.43and (2) the deformable control point nonrigid registration methodby Heiselman et al.27Average target registration error (TRE) was used as the primary quantification of registration accuracy.
A total of nine targets were measured across the three ablationsin each image-to-physical registration scenario: (a) the antennatip locations, (b) the antenna insertion points on the phantom surface, and (c) the centroids of the MRI-segmented ablation zones. Average TRE for a registration scenario was calculatedas the average distance between corresponding points in the reg- istered image and physical data sets.This metric measures the accuracy of the registration methods evaluated in this studyexclusively, independent of the MWA modeling.The positive predictive value (PPV) was used to evaluate volumetric accuracy of the predictive MWA model.PPV wascalculated as EQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e011;326;129PPV ¼NTP NTPþNFP; (11) where NTPis the volume of the model-predicted ablation zone overlapping with the observed ablation zone and NFPis the Fig.2 Representation of the degree of deformation achieved in the deformable hepatic ablation phantom.
The colormap represents thesigned surface error after rigidly registering the pre- and postdeforma-tion phantom image segmentations. The ablation zones are pre-sented as green volumes.In this case of deformation, 20- to 30-mm thick support material was placed beneath the superior rightlobe to simulate surgical packing for organ presentation.In total,four applications of deformation were applied and imaged within the phantom.Journal of Medical Imaging 025007-5 Apr –Jun 2019 Vol.6(2)Collins et al.: Multiphysics modeling toward enhanced guidance in hepatic microwave...volume of the model-predicted ablation zone, which does not overlap with the true ablation zone.We present the metric ofPPV in this study for two separate purposes: (1) to quantify the predictive capability of the MWA model without com- pounding registration error and (2) to evaluate the accuracyof the combined registration and MWA modeling framework.
To singularly evaluate the accuracy of the MWA model, the model-predicted ablation zones were directly compared to themock gross pathology. This comparison was made assumingperfect registration after manually aligning the ablation antenna tip and shaft from the model space with the corresponding loca- tions in the mock gross pathology image space.The outer abla-tion contours from each space were then revolved to create 3-D volumes, which were then compared by calculating the PPV .The combined registration and modeling framework accuracywas also evaluated by computing the PPV following registration of the model-predicted ablation zone.Inaccuracies in both the image-to-physical registration methods and MWA modelingcontribute to the error encompassed by this metric.The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to determine signifi- cance in differences between the distributions of TRE and PPV resulting from each ablation (i.e., 24 total) and each evaluatedregistration method ( α¼0.05).

The modeled ablation zone follow-ing rigid registration is presented in (a) and magnified in (b).The MWA model result following deformation correction is presented in (c) and magnified in (d).4 Discussion While the impact of soft-tissue deformation on thermal develop-ment has been explored in other contexts, 57with this work, we present the first effort to evaluate deformation correction meth- ods for image-guided hepatic MWA in the open surgical setting.Further, we couple a simple retrospective model of the ablationprocedure with clinically relevant image-guidance techniques, allowing for a greater understanding of the magnitude of error that can be associated with a combined modeling and sur-gical navigation approach.
We evaluate these methods within a deformable hepatic ablation phantom that allows for compre- hensive validation with both individual point targets and volu-metric overlap of predicted and ground-truth ablation zones. The example visualization of the evaluated registration algo- rithms on ablation antenna localization (Fig.7) tangibly demon- strates the degree to which the applied deformation correctionmethod is an improvement upon the rigid registration when soft- tissue deformation is present.This result is further supported by the quantitative results of the ablation antenna target errors inFig.4and Table 1, indicating that the deformable registration method of Heiselman et al.27represented a significant improve- ment over the rigid registration results of Clements et al.43 (p<0.001 ).
Additionally, these results demonstrate that a more complete source of surface data (e.g., as can be available in a CBCT-assisted percutaneous ablation procedure) for drivingthe registration provides further improvement to the correction when compared to the sparse-surface data that is available in the open setting ( p<0.001 ). From these results, it is also interesting to note that the source of surface data has a much more pro-nounced impact on the deformation correction method than Fig.5 Distributions of the volumetric overlap of observed and predicted ablation zones represented by the PPV.The box and whiskers represent the mean, median, upper and lower quartiles, maximum, and minimum PPV for the rigid registration method ofClements et al.43in blue/gray and the deformation correction method of Heiselman et al.27in yellow/orange.Presented results are from registering with full-surface data (blue/yellow) and sparse-surfacedata (gray/orange).

We also note that the relatively low rigid registration errors achieved in this study, as compared to prior phantom studies, indicate that the degree of achieved soft-tissue deformation within the phantom was achieved in a previous study. 26We believe that this is in large part due to the nature of the agar-albumin phantom, which is prone to shear- ing when subjected to very large deformations.However, from our past characterizations, we suggest that the 20 to 30 mm of deformation that was achieved in this study was representative of clinical use and was adequate for understanding the relativeperformance of the registration methods.
27,54Additionally, while the resampled sparse-surface data provide further improvement to the rigid registration method, that was not the case for the deformation correction method as it was in original 2017 study.29We believe that this is because the simulated sparse-sur- face data in this work did not include simulated acquisition noise (i.e., it was selected directly from the MRI surface), which the resampling approach was specifically designed to address (e.g., we have observed manually swabbed organ surface data to have an average noise of 1 to 2 mm). In addition to reporting antenna target errors, the volumetric error associated with the retrospectively modeled ablation zoneshas been presented in Fig.5and Table 2.Again, these results demonstrate improved localization by the deformation correc- tion method.This is clearly demonstrated in Fig.
7when com- paring the overlap of the red ablation (rigid registration) with the green (ground-truth) to the overlap of the blue ablation (defor-mation corrected) on the same ground-truth. As with the target errors, we see in Table 2that for each data source the deforma- tion correction method of Heiselman et al.27significantly improves upon the rigid alignment method of Clementset al.43(p<0.001 ).These registration results are in line with previous clinical and phantom evaluations.27,28,30 Figure 3and Table 2present the maximum volumetric accu- racy of the retrospective ablation model under the condition of perfect localization.Furthermore, Fig.6presents these results in comparison to the modeled ablation zones following registrationas a function of their localization accuracy.
These novel results represent the loss in model-predictive capacity ( −5.95% ∕mm, p<0.001 ,r¼0.93) that is associated with increasing antenna localization error in a combined navigation and modeling frame- work. However, in this initial work, we retrospectively model the ablation outcome by reconstructing phantom-specific prop-erties, which limit immediate clinical applicability.Although, there is precedence within the literature for determining disease state and approximating tissue properties from preoperative im-aging using MRI 58or ultrasound.59Another limitation to the current model is that neither the phantom nor the model include tissue perfusion, which has been shown to have an impact onablation outcome 43–47but is difficult to implement within the phantom setting.Further development of these methods would provide a plat- form for clinicians to preoperatively define an approach for ablating targeted lesions while sparing healthy tissue and ensur- ing adequate margins.
Such a patient-specific plan would pro-vide ablation antenna target and trajectory information that would then be provided intraoperatively to achieve the optimal ablation. During treatment, organ surface data would be col-lected and then used to achieve a deformable registration using the methods presented in this work.Finally, under enhanced image-guidance, the physician could then deploy the ablationantenna to the preoperatively defined configuration, confirming placement with tracked iUS, before delivery therapy.In summary, our results suggest that this application is a sig- nificant advancement in the field of open hepatic image-guided Fig.7 An example of ablation model predictions following registration with sparse anterior surface data.In each panel, green represents the ground truth ablation zone as observed in MRI.The rigidly registeredablation model is presented in (a) and detailed views in (b).

Additionally, in each panel the registeredablation antenna are indicated by lines with color corresponding to the registration method.Journal of Medical Imaging 025007-8 Apr –Jun 2019 Vol.6(2)Collins et al.: Multiphysics modeling toward enhanced guidance in hepatic microwave...ablation, as soft-tissue deformation is a considerable limitation to current modeling and guidance frameworks for liver tumortreatments.57While EM-iUS methods18,19take a purely intrao- perative imaging approach to this soft-tissue deformation prob- lem, they fail to provide additional information concerningrelevant critical anatomy, a common desire given the availability of preoperative imaging data.Furthermore, EM-iUS approaches are restricted to US-visible tumors, which restrict its applicabil-ity when considering nonechogenic tumors that can presentfollowing neoadjuvant therapy.
22,23Other studies have reported targeting accuracy of ablation antennas on the order of 5 to 10 mm, with the current best being a median accuracy of4.2 mm. 19In comparison, our presented method of deformation correction has produced favorable accuracies of 2.5/C61.1and 3.7/C61.4 mm when using full- and sparse-surface data, respec- tively.While this work was directed toward the open surgical setting, we show that these methods can enhance image-guid- ance for percutaneous, laparoscopic, and open hepatic ablationprocedures.5 Conclusions The objective of this work was to quantify the localization andvolumetric accuracy of a model-based deformation correction method when applied to image-guided hepatic MWA.Evaluation of the applied method shows significant improve-ment in localization accuracy when compared to a clinically rel- evant rigid registration approach.
Furthermore, we incorporate a simple, retrospective model of MWA into the navigationalframework, providing an important initial evaluation of the interplay between localization accuracy and volumetric overlap of predicted and ground-truth ablation zones. While future workis necessary to apply this modeling and navigational frameworkas a prospective, targeting approach, the deformation correction method applied in this study is certainly an advancement toward improved localization in open hepatic MWA procedures.Goingfurther, this work proposes to extend the concept of “model cor- rection ”in surgical navigation to include a new biophysical domain, namely the deposition of ablative energy, and its cor-responding thermal evolution.This combined mechanics/energy framework represents the first study toward a more comprehen- sive model-predictive paradigm for an important image-guidedtherapeutic process in use today.
