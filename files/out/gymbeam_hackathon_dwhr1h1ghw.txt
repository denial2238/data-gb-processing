Abstract: Piglet weaning is an important stage in production where changes in the environment and diet can cause problems such as intestinal inﬂammation and diarrhea. Vitamin A is an essential nutrient for human and animal growth and has immunomodulatory and inﬂammatory effects.A large body of literature has previously reported on the use of vitamin A in piglet production, so our experiment added different concentrations of vitamin A (0, 1100, 2200, 4400, 8800, and 17,600 IU/kg) to weaned piglet diets to study the effects of different doses on growth performance, intestinal barrier, inﬂammation, and ﬂora in weaned piglets.We selected 4400 IU/kg as the optimum concentration of vitamin A in relation to average daily weight gain, feed intake, feed-to-weight ratio, and diarrhea rate, and subsequently tested the inﬂammatory factors, immunoglobulin content, antioxidant levels, and intestinal ﬂora of weaned piglets.
Results: We observed that the diarrhea rate of weaned piglets was signiﬁcantly lower after the addition of 4400 IU/kg of vitamin A to the diet ( p< 0.05). A control group and a 4400 IU/kg VA group were selected for subsequent experiments.We found that after the addition of vitamin A, the serum CAT level of weaned piglets increased signiﬁcantly, the expression of Claudin-1 in the jejunum and ileum increased signiﬁcantly, the expression of Occludin gene in the jejunum increased signiﬁcantly, the expression of IL-5 and IL-10 in the ileum increased signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05), and the expression of IL-4,IL-5, and IL-10 in the ileum increased signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05).Meanwhile, in the colonic ﬂora of vitamin A-added weaned piglets, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Erysipelotrichales decreased signiﬁcantly, while the relative abundance of Bacteroidales increased signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05).
The results of this study indicated that vitamin A at 4400 IU/kg reduces diarrhea in weaned piglets by increasing antioxidant levels, increasing intestinal tight junction protein gene expression, and regulating colonic gut microbiota.

https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12122049 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 2049 2 of 14 cytokines frequently disrupt tight junction (TJ) proteins, whereas anti-inﬂammatory cy- tokines protect epithelial barrier function [ 4]. For animal health, the intestinal microbiota is an important environmental factor.A healthy gut microbiota contributes to the host’s nutrient metabolism, the structural integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, immune regulation, cognitive and behavioral development, and pathogen protection [ 5].Previous studies have shown that dietary antibiotics can effectively solve the problems caused by stress in piglets, while the prohibition of antibiotics leads to frequent bacterial diseases, reducing pig performance, greatly increasing the rate of diarrhea, increasing the utilization rate of therapeutic antibiotics, and increasing the production cost of pigs [ 6].These studies were concerned with the role of nutrients in weaning piglets.
Vitamin A is a fat-soluble compound that cannot be synthesized in animals and needs to be obtained from feed. Vitamin A, as an organic compound, can be metabolized and transported into retinol, retinoic acid, retinaldehyde, and other substances in the body by related enzymes [ 7–10].Previous studies have shown that vitamin A can improve the growth performance, and antioxidant and immune capacity of animals [ 11–13].Vitamin A deﬁciency lowers immunity and causes inﬂammation, while excessive supplementation can be toxic, causing headaches, bone pain, and brain edema [ 14].Zhou et al.found that weaned piglets supplemented with vitamin A signiﬁcantly improved growth performance, glutathione peroxidase levels, and serum IgA levels [ 11].Hu et al.found that vitamin A enhances the activity of immunoglobulin M and glutathione peroxidase in weaner piglets by using starch and gelatin coatings [ 15].
Moreover, previous research has discovered that vitamin A regulates the interaction of eukaryotic host cells with symbiotic microor- ganisms as well as the complexity of the microbiome, which in turn regulates vitamin A metabolism in the host [ 16]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with vitamin A on diarrhea, antioxidant capacity, immunity, and gut microbiota in piglets where no antibiotics were used, and to explore the optimum concentration of vitamin A in the diet of weaned piglets.2.Methods and Materials The experimental procedures used in this study were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Guangzhou, China) (No.GAASIAS-2020-005).2.1.Animal Experimental Treatments Seventy-two piglets (Duroc ×Landrace×Yorkshire) at 8.23 ±0.10 kg average body weight were weaned at the age of 21 days and randomly divided into six groups.
Piglets were randomly divided into 6 groups according to body weight, with half male and half female in each group. The six groups were the control group with basic diet and basic diet added with 1100, 2200, 4400, 8800, and 17,600 IU/kg of vitamin A, respectively, each group had 6 replicate pens per group and 2 piglets in each pen.The composition of the basic diet (Table 1) was designed according to the nutritional requirements of the National Research Council (NRC, 2012) for piglets weighing 7 to 11 kg.And no antibiotics were used in the diet.The piglets were free to feed and water throughout the 28-day experimental period.Illness, diarrhea, or any abnormal behavior was observed and recorded (Diarrhea rate% = Number of piglets with diarrhea in the trial period/(number of test heads ×test time)×100%).On days 0, 12, and 28, piglets BW and feed consumed were weighed to determine the average daily feed intake (ADFI) and average daily gain (ADG).
The feed conversion ratio (F/G) of weaned piglets was calculated as the ratio of ADFI to ADG. Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 2049 3 of 14 Table 1.Basal diet composition and nutrient levels (feeding basis).

Growth Performance and Diarrhea Rate Compared to those in the control group, there was no signiﬁcant difference in body weight, ADFI, ADG, and F:G after weaned piglets treated with different concentrations of vitamin A. However, the vitamin A supplementation group showed a much lower diarrhea rate than that in the control group (Table 3).After the antioxidant level, intestinal tight junc- tion protein, and cytokine expression of all treatments were tested, the 4400 IU/kg group had more positive effects in weaned piglets than other treatments (Figures S1–S3).There- fore, 4400 IU/kg vitamin A supplemental treatment was fully chosen and discussed below.Table 3.Effect of diet supplementary Vitamin A on growth performance of weaned piglets.

Our study found that vitamin A had no signiﬁcant effect on body weight, feed intake, and feed/gain of weaned piglets, but vitamin A could reduce the diarrhea rate of piglets. This may be a meaningful indicator of weaning stress.Weaning causes oxidative stress [ 20].Oxidative damage is an important mechanism that damages the immune function and health of the body.The antioxidant system of the body has limited ability to clear free radicals, and excessive oxygen free radicals will destroy fat, protein, and nucleic acids in the body.Changes in the activities of oxidase GSH-Px, SOD, and CAT are closely related to the stress response of animals and can be used to reﬂect the immune state of the body [ 21].Serum antioxidant capacity can reﬂect the resistance of animals to endogenous oxidative damage, and a higher antioxidant capacity has a beneﬁcial effect on alleviating oxidative stress [ 22].
CAT is an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, and is one of the important antioxidant enzymes that protect cells from reactive oxygen species. Supplementation of different concentrations of vitamin A in rats decreased the activity of CAT in the lungs, causing oxidative stress [ 23].But our results showed that blood CAT levels increased signiﬁcantly after the addition of vitamin A.In this study, vitamin A enhances the antioxidant capacity of weaned piglets by increasing CAT level.In addition, vitamin A is also essential in humoral immunity, especially for antibody production [ 24].Immunoglobulin is synthesized by plasma cells and lymphocytes.As an antibody, it is abundant in serum, accounting for about 20–25% of the total protein in serum.In addition, studies have shown that the addition of gelatin and vitamin A starch can improve the levels of IgA and IgM in serum [ 15].
IgM is the primary antibody of the primary immune response and the most common immunoglobulin expressed on the surface of B cells. The most prevalent antibody in blood circulation, IgG binds to a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, to prevent infection [ 25].IgA is the main antibody heterotype produced on the mucosal surface, which can effectively prevent bacterial colonization and transfer in intestinal mucosa [ 26].Our results showed that vitamin A did not signiﬁcantly increase the serum immunoglobulin content of weaned piglets, but there was no downward trend.Our results may be related to the method of vitamin A supplementation.The principal organ for nutrition digestion and absorption, the intestine also acts as a selective barrier against both endogenous and foreign antigens.Intestinal health, particularly the integrity of the intestinal barrier, is essential for preserving the organism’s healthy state.
Tight junctions, which are the primary determinants of intestinal barrier function and close the paracellular space between adjacent epithelial cells, are necessary for intestinal integrity [ 27,28]. Vitamin A deﬁciency caused a colon-intestinal barrier in mice, which not only reduced the secretion of immunoglobulin A, but also down-regulated the colon-tight-junction-related protein Occludin and Claudin-1 [29].Our results showed that the expression of Claudin-1 ,Occludin, and ZO-1 in the jejunum and the expression of Claudin-1 and ZO-1 in the ileum of weaned piglets increased signiﬁcantly after vitamin A was added.Vitamin A plays a protective role in the intestinal tract of weaned piglets.E.coli is one of the important causes of diarrhea in piglets.The addition of probiotics can improve the decreased expression levels of Occludin ,Claudin-1, and ZO-1 in the intestinal tract infected by E.coli [30].
More conﬁrmation that vitamin A enhances tight junction protein gene expression may be one of the reasons for improving diarrhea in weaned piglets. Vitamin A has been shown to be associated with inﬂammation in animals, and intesti- nal inﬂammation in piglets is expressed at the genetic level by the interleukin gene [ 31,32].Immunity in the organism is a complex process and is often divided into innate and ac- Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 2049 10 of 14 quired immunity.Vitamin A may be involved in the immune response associated with the intestinal mucosa through the regulation of the cytokines IL-4 [33].Chen et al.
observed that ATRA increased the mRNA of the IL-4 receptor alpha chain, and increased IL-4-induced phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and mRNA expression of chloride channels [ 34].IL-5 regulates the acquired immune response and acts on target cells by binding to its speciﬁc IL-5 receptor ( IL-5R).IL-5 activates JAK1/2- STAT1/2 and Ras/ERK channels to act on inﬂammation in the body [ 35]. In addition to this, IL-5 can stimulate the secretion of IgM and IgG by staphylococcal A-activated B cells [ 36], and recent reports have found that IL-5 can collaborate with IL-21 to induce the proliferation of IgA cells [ 37].IL-4 and IL-5 are cytokines produced by TH2 helper T cells and mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils, both markers of the development of TH2 inﬂammation, along with systemic inﬂammation [ 38].Nutritional regulation of allergic inﬂammation of mucosal surfaces is of great importance.
Vitamin A deﬁciency decreased the TH2 response and increased the TH1 response [39]. In this study, the addition of vitamin A signiﬁcantly increased the expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 in the gut.Vitamin A has a regulatory effect on stress-induced intestinal inﬂammation in weaned piglets, but its effect on related pathways needs to be conﬁrmed by subsequent experiments.The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized to play a role in regulating host growth performance, metabolism, diarrhea [ 40], and inﬂammatory responses [ 41].Dietary nutrients are digested and absorbed in the foregut before undigested components and endogenous substances are fermented by the gut microbiota in the hindgut [ 42,43].The establishment of a healthy, stable, and diverse intestinal ﬂora is important for weaning piglets to resist stress and intestinal disease.
In the present study, we demonstrated signiﬁcant differences in the structure and content of intestinal ﬂora between piglets fed vitamin A and control piglets. αdiversity can be used as an indicator of the functional resilience of the intestinal microbial ecosystem, including species richness and species diversity [ 44].From our experimental results, there was no signiﬁcant change.PCA and PCoA are methods for downscaling and displaying multidimensional data differences on a two-dimensional coordinate plot.The closer the samples are in the graph, the more similar their community composition is [ 45].Our data show that after the addition of vitamin A, the cecum ﬂora of piglets still changed and did not completely overlap.The ratio of thick-walled to Bacteroidetes phylum is a common evaluation indicator that represents the imbalance in intestinal ﬂora composition [ 46].
Our study discovered an increase in Bacteroidetes , and it was hypothesized that vitamin A altered the composition of weaned piglet cecum ﬂora. Actinobacteria are Gram-positive bacteria with mycelium and substrates that are rich in bioactive secondary metabolites such as enzymes, antibiotics, and antioxidants [ 47].Actinobacteria also produce a variety of antimicrobial agents [ 48].In this experiment, we found that Actinobacteria at the gateway level increased the abundance of Actinobacteria in the piglet cecum.In one study [ 49], researchers discovered that Erysipelotrichia of the intestine reduces improving oxidative stress caused by weaning stress in piglets.Similar to our ﬁndings, it is hypothesized that vitamin A can reduce weaning-induced oxidative stress by decreasing Erysipelotrichia .Intestinal oxidative stress triggers intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, which is associated with post-weaning diarrhea and intestinal infections.
Ellagic acid with antioxidant capacity can modulate the gut microbiota of weanling piglets to alleviate intestinal damage and oxidative stress [ 50]. We suspect that vitamin A has a similar effect on relieving diarrhea.Chai et al.[ 51] found from the transcriptome that the gene expression module for vitamin A effects in the small intestine differed in the colon, again perhaps because vitamin A absorption and metabolism occurs mostly in the small intestine.Although the small intestine and colon are contiguous organs with similar developmental origins, there are differences between their biological functions.The speciﬁc mechanisms by which vitamin A regulates the intestinal ﬂora in weaned piglets are not fully deﬁned by changes in ﬂora abundance and need to be explored in more depth.In conclusion, 4400 IU/kg vitamin has positive effects on the growth performance, intestinal inﬂammation, and intestinal ﬂora of weaned piglets.Antioxidants 2023 ,12, 2049 11 of 14 5.
Conclusions Dietary supplementation with 4400 IU/kg vitamin A reduced the diarrhea rate of weaned piglets. Vitamin A improved weaned piglet catalase activity, improved weaned piglet antioxidant capacity, improved the intestinal barrier in the jejunum and ileum, regulated intestinal inﬂammation in the jejunum and ileum, and inﬂuenced cecum intestinal ﬂora.This study may provide a foundation for the use of vitamin A in antibiotic-free piglet production, but more in vivo and ex vivo experiments are needed to prove this.Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/antiox12122049/s1, Figure S1: Effect of vitamin A supplementation on serum antioxidant levels; Figure S2: Effect of vitamin A supplementation on the expression levels of tight junction proteins in the jejunum and ileum; Figure S3: Effect of vitamin A supplementation on the expression levels of inﬂammatory cytokines in the jejunum and ileum.
