Narrative Review 1 Medicine®Magnesium sulfate for postoperative pain in orthopedic surgery A narrative review Lana Sbitan, MDa, Ayman Issa Nabhan, MDb,*, Bana Zuhair Alafandi, MDc, Omar Alzraikat, MDd, Noor Alzraikat, MDe Abstract Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4) is a widely used adjuvant in anesthesia.Often administered with local anesthetics, it is known to reduce analgesic and opioid consumption while extending the duration of analgesia.MgSO4 applications extend to orthopedic surgeries, cardiovascular and urogenital procedures, offering extended postoperative pain relief.While commonly administered through various routes, there is a research gap concerning the comparative efficacy of intrathecal (IT) and intravenous (IV) MgSO4 administration.This narrative review aims to provide a comparison between IT and IV administration of MgSO4 particularly following orthopedic procedures, where pain management is paramount.
A comprehensive literature search was conducted across several electronic databases, trial registries, and gray literature from inception to 2023. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies investigating the effects of perioperative IT administration of magnesium compared to perioperative IV administration of MgSO4 in patients undergoing surgery, with no language restrictions.Our search identified 4326 articles, of which 9 randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria.We summarized these selected articles.Four studies discussed IT magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) administration, 2 focused on IT administration in orthopedic surgeries, and 3 explored both IV and IT administration of MgSO4 in orthopedic surgery.IT MgSO4 shows promise in postoperative pain management, delaying block onset and extending duration.Personalized administration choice, considering patient factors and surgery type, is crucial.
Further research is needed to refine strategies for better patient outcomes, particularly following orthopedic surgeries.

Introduction Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4) is among the 5 most used adju- vants in anesthesia,[1] often given as an adjuvant with a local anesthetic such as bupivacaine to reduce analgesic consumption, prolong analgesic time,[2] and reduce opioid use.[3] The use of MgSO4 can be attributed to its use in specific specialties or it can be due to the recent attention multimodal anesthetic tech- niques have garnered.[1] Published guidelines recommend the use of opioid-free analgesia and multimodal treatment methods to relieve postoperative pain.[2] MgSO4 works by antagonizing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in spinal neurons, leading to the attenuation of central and peripheral sensitization, ultimately decreasing the risk of chronic persistent postoperative pain after opera- tions such as total knee arthroplasty.[2,4] Furthermore, MgSO4 inhibits calcium influx into cells via voltage-gated chan- nels, which reduces neuronal excitability and causes an anti- nociceptive effect for acute pain.[3,5] Additionally, it can increase the clinical duration of neuromuscular blockers, thus reducing the frequency of their use.[1] MgSO4 has anti-inflammatory and anti-modulatory effects and strengthens chondral regeneration.[2] Other benefits include prevention and treatment of preeclampsia and eclamp- sia along with many other uses in intensive care or emergen- cies.[1] While generally safe at recommended doses, MgSO4 can lead to hypotension, residual neuromuscular blockade, hyper - magnesemia, intravenous (IV) injection pain, and respiratory depression.[1] MgSO4 has been observed to decrease analgesic consumption and increase postoperative analgesia in urogenital, orthopedic, The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.

Magnesium sulfate for postoperative pain in orthopedic surgery: A narrative review.Medicine 2024;103:24(e38522).Received: 8 February 2024 / Received in final form: 13 March 2024 / Accepted: 17 May 2024 http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000038522 2Sbitan et al.• Medicine (2024) 103:24 Medicine and cardiovascular surgeries.The use of MgSO4 has been shown to decrease extubation time in cardiovascular surger - ies.A decrease in mean arterial pressure was also observed in those who underwent gastrointestinal, orthopedic, and urogen- ital surgeries.The duration of postoperative analgesia is highest in orthopedic surgeries.The benefits of MgSO4 start to appear in the first 24 hours following orthopedic and cardiovascular surgeries, and the pain relief lasts for 48 hours after orthope- dic surgeries.
Conversely, the analgesic effect of MgSO4 starts to weaken only 24 hours after urogenital and cardiovascular surgeries.[6] In total knee arthroplasties, MgSO4 given with spinal anes- thesia has been found to decrease the incidence of chronic persistent postoperative pain 1 year after the surgery, improve postoperative analgesia, and prolong the duration of the spinal sensorial block.[3] For arthroscopic surgeries, it is essential to use multimodal analgesic methods to provide sufficient pain relief for early mobilization and rehabilitation. Local anesthetics on their own have some limitations including shorter duration of action, low availability in wards, chondrotoxicity, and strict monitoring for side effects.
So, it is optimal to combine it with MgSO4 to pro- long postoperative analgesia, decrease the dose of analgesics, and protect chondrocytes.[7] In the recent era, the use of intrathecal (IT) adjuvants has gained traction due to its ability to extend the duration of the block, improve patient well-being, and decrease resource utiliza- tion compared with general anesthesia.[8] Currently, there is a gap in the literature regarding the use of IT MgSO4 in orthopedic surgery compared with the IV route of administration. This study aims to help bridge this gap by discussing the evidence related to IT use in orthopedics and pro- viding extensive comparisons between the 2 routes.2.Methods 2.1.Search strategy and inclusion criteria From inception up until May 2023, a comprehensive search was conducted across various databases including Medline, Embase, Lilacs, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Scopus, as well as trial registries such as the ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.

Discussion 4.1. IT MgSO4 use in surgery The analgesic properties of magnesium are attributed to its impact on NMDA receptors as it hinders central sensitization by blocking excessive activation of pathways in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.However, magnesium has a restricted ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier thereby limiting its analgesic effects, as well as the adverse side effects of elevated magnesium serum levels.Therefore, the IT administration of magnesium can help avoid these side effects and potenti- ate opiates within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during spinal analgesia.[18] IT MgSO4 has been widely used as an adjuvant to local anesthetics in spinal anesthesia.
Looking into the literature, we included 4 studies that reported the effects of the admin- istration of IT MgSO4 in spinal anesthesia compared to different adjuvants added to hyperbaric bupivacaine.[8,10–12] Adult patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II of either gender undergoing lower abdominal or lower limb surgeries were included in these studies,[8,10,12] except for one study on pregnant women under - going cesarean section.[11] Patients who were allergic to the study drugs, obese, and suffered from uncontrolled hyperten- sion or any contraindication to spinal anesthesia were mainly excluded.IT MgSO4 was compared to Nalbuphine,[10] Dexmedetomidine,[8] Sodium Chloride,[11] and Normal Saline,[8,12] s an adjuvant to bupivacaine. Details regarding the baseline characteristics of patients included in these studies are further demonstrated in Table 1.
The onset time for sensory and motor block, time to sensory and motor regression, and duration of anesthesia were stud- ied among the different groups. The onset of motor block was assessed at a Bromage grade 3 level, and the onset of sensory block was recorded at the T10 dermatome level.However, the T8 dermatome level was accepted by Sen et al as the onset of sensory block,[12] and the time of a Bromage score of 1 was recorded as motor block onset by Xiao et al.[11] All studies reported significantly delayed onset of both sen- sory and motor block in the MgSO4 groups compared to other adjuvants.Additionally, dexmedetomidine was found superior to both MgSO4 and normal saline in terms of rapid onset of sensory and motor blockade.[8] The sensory and motor block regression time was significantly prolonged in the MgSO4 groups, but the dexmedetomidine group showed a slightly lon- ger regression time.
Xiao et al studied the effect of IT MgSO4 on reducing the median effective dose (ED50) of IT hyperbaric bupivacaine in spinal bupivacaine-sufentanil anesthesia for cesarean section and found that the addition of MgSO4 did not reduce the ED50, but prolonged the duration of effective anesthesia,[11] which is inconsistent with another study on patients undergoing infra- umbilical surgeries showing that IT MgSO4, when added to hyperbaric bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia, significantly pro- longs the duration of anesthesia.[12] Meanwhile, Choudhury et al reported a significantly shorter duration of effective anesthesia recorded in the IT MgSO4 group compared to the Nalbuphine group.[10] Only 2 studies reported the adverse side effects of IT MgSO4 in spinal anesthesia, including hypotension, bradycardia, nau- sea, and vomiting.
However, they were all found statistically insignificant.[10,11] Accordingly, IT MgSO4 as an adjuvant to hyperbaric bupiv- acaine in spinal anesthesia for lower abdomen and lower limb surgeries, as well as cesarean sections, significantly prolongs the duration of effective anesthesia and delays sensory and motor block regression. Whereas Nalbuphine and Dexmedetomidine had a faster onset of anesthesia.Table 2 Summary of clinical studies using intrathecal magnesium sulfate in orthopedic surgeries.Study ID CountryType of Surgery Intervention Control Conclusion Faiz et al 2012[1]Iran Orthopedic lower limb surgery- Group B: Bupivacaine plus magnesium sulfate 50% (na = 30) - Group A: bupivacaine 0.5% Spinal heavy 4 cc.(n = 30) - Group C: bupivacaine plus neostigmine 0.5 mg/mL.(n = 30)Adding magnesium sulfate: - Efficiently increases motor block onset time - Enhances the safety of the procedure Kathuria at al.

Comparing magnesium to placebo and neostigmine contributes to a better understanding of magnesium effect on anesthesia parameters and side effects. 4.2.1.Comparison with placebo.Kathuria study showed a significant prolonged onset of sensory block in magnesium groups, while Faiz study demonstrated an insignificant prolonged onset of sensory block.Similar findings were presented in motor block onset by Kathuria.On the other hand, motor block onset was slightly earlier in the magnesium group in the Faiz study, although this difference was insignificant.Motor block recovery was significantly faster in Faiz study when compared to placebo while Kathuria study demonstrated later recovery.Sensory block recovery was reported by Kathuria, and it was also delayed compared to placebo.Duration of surgery was shorter in Faiz compared to placebo, whereas Kathuria showed longer surgery duration, however, these differences were insignificant.
Furthermore, VAS pain assessment scores were reported solely in the Kathuria study, with magnesium groups showing a lower level in all intervals except for 24 hours, which was higher compared to placebo. The duration of spinal anesthesia was significantly longer in magnesium groups when compared to placebo as reported by Kathuria.However, a major difference regarding motor block onset definition was presented as Kathuria identified it as Bromage 3 while Faiz decided to accept Bromage 2 as the onset of motor block.This is a possible explanation of the differences between the 2 studies regarding motor block onset and recovery and duration of surgery.Faiz identified the T10 dermatome level as the onset of sensory block while Kathuria accepted the T8-9 dermatome level.[13,14] 4.2.2.When compared with neostigmine.Faiz study compared magnesium to neostigmine.
Neostigmine showed an earlier onset of sensory block while magnesium had the earliest onset of motor block, however, these findings were insignificant. The time for motor block recovery was significantly longer in the neostigmine group.The neostigmine group had the highest incidence of side effects, specifically nausea and vomiting.[13] Overall, IT administration of MgSO4 is associated with improved outcomes in terms of extending sensory and motor block recovery time.This extension leads to a longer duration for the patient to feel or move his lower limbs, thus increasing the time required for analgesics.4.3.IT vs IV MgSO4 in orthopedic surgery The principal objective of numerous clinical trials has been to amplify the dynamic recovery of function after orthopedic sur - gery.These trials have sought to investigate and compare the effects of administering MgSO4 either IV or IT before surgery.
Upon review of the literature, 3 clinical trials were identified, all of which investigated the outcomes after administering MgSO4 IT and compared it to IV route. These trials included seventy-five, sixty, and ninety adult patients with an ASA physi- cal status I or II.[15–17] Patients undergoing different orthopedic surgeries under spinal anesthesia, unilateral total hip arthroplasty, elective fixa- tion of a femoral shaft fracture using interlocking fixation, and extracapsular hip fracture surgery, were enrolled and random- ized into different groups.One of the trials had 2 phases, exper - imental and clinical.[16] Table 3 Summary of clinical studies comparing intravenous and intrathecal magnesium sulfate in orthopedic surgery.

While the control group received hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl.[15] In contrast, Kumar et al compared IT administration of MgSO4 with bupivacaine and IV administration of MgSO4 with IT bupivacaine. The control group had IT bupivacaine with nor - mal saline.[17] In the clinical phase of Messeha and Boshra study, patients were randomized into 3 groups, the intervention groups received an IT mixture of morphine with bupivacaine and MgSO4 or an IV mixture of morphine and MgSO4 with IT bupivacaine.While the control group received a mixture of morphine with IT bupivacaine.[16] Refer to Table 3 for better understanding.In Kumar et al, IV MgSO4 group had longer sensory and motor blockade compared to the patients in the IT group or control group.[17] In contrast, Samir et al did not report sig- nificant differences between study groups in onset time and maximum sensory level achieved, as well as onset and dura- tion of motor block.
Regarding postoperative pain, Samir et al reported similar improvements in postoperative analgesia for both the IV and IT groups. Postoperative pain scores and 24-hour analgesic consumption were lower in intervention groups with insignificant differences between them compared to the control group.[15] However, Kumar et al reported a lon- ger pain-free interval and lower pain scores for IV MgSO4.[17] Figure 2 illustrates the differences in outcomes among the groups across the studies.Concerning Intraoperative blood loss and postoperative mg levels, Samir et al reported a significant decrease in intraopera- tive blood loss associated with IV infusion of MgSO4.However, postoperative mg levels were higher in this group, without con- sequential side effects.[15] Messeha and Boshra study reported that IV MgSO4 was equally effective in potentiating the analgesic effect of morphine compared to the IT route.
The role of IV MgSO4 administration was emphasized in avoiding the side effects associated with the IT route, such as motor paralysis.[16] 4.4. Strengths and limitations In our comprehensive literature review, we employed strict cri- teria and a thorough search strategy for the inclusion of studies.After searching major databases, clinical trials registries, and gray literature, our study predominantly comprised randomized clinical trials with minimal risk-of-bias, thereby strengthening the evidence base.By synthesizing the findings from multiple clinical trials, our review, to our knowledge, is the first to offer a clearer under - standing of the effectiveness and safety of IT MgSO4 in ortho- pedic surgery.Additionally, it highlights gaps and inconsistencies in current research.Clinically, our review lays the groundwork for future research in the field, advocating for further investiga- tions into the potential benefits and risks associated with using IT MgSO4 in orthopedic surgery.
Utilizing the Cochrane Quality Assessment Tool (RoB V2) to rigorously assess the methodolog- ical quality of the included trials enhances the reliability of our review. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, conducting a formal analysis was not possible.Future systematic reviews should incorporate meta-analysis and compare the findings Figure 2.Outcomes comparison between studies comparing intravenous and intrathecal administration of magnesium sulfate.7Sbitan et al.• Medicine (2024) 103:24 www.md-journal.com from each newly published trial.Additionally, due to differences in patient populations, surgical settings, and underrepresenta- tion of certain groups like pediatrics and the elderly, limited gen- eralizability is another constraint of this study.Furthermore, most included trials did not report on the long- term effects of the intervention, which is a crucial aspect in the field of orthopedic surgery.Therefore, future research should aim to address these limitations.
5. Conclusion MgSO4 is a valuable adjuvant in anesthesia, especially in the realm of orthopedic surgery, significantly enhancing postop- erative pain management.While its efficacy is evident, the choice between the mode of administration remains a critical decision.IT administration offers several advantages such as delayed onset and extended block duration.However, the choice between the 2 modes of administration should be individual- ized, considering patient-specific factors.This review highlights the need for further research to optimize the use of MgSO4 in surgical procedures.Acknowledgments We thank the contribution of Noor Alawad who assisted in designing the figure in this study.Author contributions Conceptualization: Lana Sbitan, Noor Alzraikat.Data curation: Lana Sbitan, Ayman Issa Nabhan, Bana Zuhair Alafandi, Omar Alzraikat, Noor Alzraikat.Investigation: Bana Zuhair Alafandi.Methodology: Lana Sbitan.Project administration: Lana Sbitan.
