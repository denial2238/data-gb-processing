PAPER A randomised placebo controlled exploratory study of vitamin B-12, lofepramine, and L-phenylalanine (the“Cari Loder regime”) in the treatment of multiple sclerosis D T Wade , C A Young , K R Chaudhuri ,DLW Davidson .............................................................................................................................J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2002; 73:246–249 Objective: To determine whether combination therapy with lofepramine, L-phenylalanine, and intramuscular vitamin B-12 (the “Cari Loder regime”) reduces disability in patients with multiple sclero- sis.Methods: A placebo controlled, double blind, randomised study carried out in five United Kingdom centres on outpatients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis, measurable disability on Guy’s neuro- logical disability scale (GNDS), no relapse in the preceding six months, and not on antidepressantdrugs.
Over 24 weeks all patients received vitamin B-12, 1 mg intramuscularly weekly, and either lofe- pramine 70 mg and L-phenylalanine 500 mg twice daily, or matching placebo tablets. Outcome was assessed using the GNDS, the Kurtzke expanded disability status scale; the Beck depression inventory,the Chalder fatigue scale, and the Gulick MS specific symptom scale.Results: 138 patients were entered, and two were lost from each group.There was no statistically sig- nificant difference between the groups at entry or at follow up.Analysis of covariance suggested thattreated patients had better outcomes on four of the five scales used.Both groups showed a reductionof 2 GNDS points within the first two weeks, and when data from all time points were considered, the treated group had a significant improvement of 0.6 GNDS points from two weeks onwards.Conclusions: Patients with multiple sclerosis improved by 2 GNDS points after starting vitamin B-12 injections.
The addition of lofepramine and L-phenylalanine added a further 0.6 points benefit. Moreresearch is needed to confirm and explore the significance of this clinically small difference.Patients with multiple sclerosis often approach their doctors with suggestions and requests for novel therapybecause there are so few treatments of proven efﬁcacy.There is some evidence to support the use of disease modify-ing drugs such as βinterferons and azathioprine, although the beneﬁts are small.1There is more evidence in support of symptomatic treatments such as amantadine for fatigue2and baclofen for spasticity.Rehabilitation by a multidisciplinaryspecialist team may also be beneﬁcial.34Nonetheless patients will continue to seek alternative treatments.In 1996 Ms Cari Loder published a book5espousing one such treatment, the combination of oral lofepramine andL-phenylalanine with vitamin B-12 injections.
One element of this, lofepramine, had been proposed by a Swedish group, butonly uncontrolled data were published. 6 The scientiﬁc rationale is sparse.One paper has suggested that multiple sclerosis may follow from reduced centralnoradrenaline levels, and reported that “approximately 75% of[300] patients experience a substantial improvement” after acombination of tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants and L-DOPA.6The current regime may increase noradrenaline levels—lofepramine limits noradrenaline uptake at synapses, and L-phenylalanine is a precursor of noradrenaline.We areunaware of any other supportive evidence or theory.No phaseI or phase II studies were undertaken.Our aim in this study was primarily to discover whether there was sufﬁcient evidence of reduction in disability to sup- port further investigation in detail.Secondary aims were tomonitor possible side effects and to explore effects on a rangeof speciﬁc symptoms related to multiple sclerosis.
In thisexploratory study we investigated the dose regime proposed, 5 to determine if beneﬁts occurred that were worthy of further investigation. In the absence of any pilot trials, our studyincluded any patient who had measurable disability, incontrast to most current research which generally selects less disabled patients or other subgroups.This study is also one ofthe ﬁrst major trials of a drug intervention to use a speciﬁcdisability measure 7–9as its primary outcome.METHODS We used a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled design.All patients were given vitamin B-12 1000 µg intramuscularly weekly for 24 weeks.One group of patients was randomised to receive lofepramine 70 mg twice daily and L-phenylalanine 500 mg twice daily (the combination group),and the remainder were given matching placebo tablets (thecontrol group).
Patients were included if they had clinically deﬁnite multiple sclerosis, 10were aged between 18 years and 65 years, gave written informed consent and were willing and able to comply with the follow up schedule, and had signiﬁcant disability. Disability was deﬁned as a score of 3.0 or more on the Kurtzke extended disability status scale (EDSS)11and 2/5 or more in two of eight domains from the Guy’s neurological disability scale (GNDS).79The eight domains were: fatigue, mobility, bladder, bowel, mental state, vision, speech, and swallowing.
Patients were excluded for the following reasons: •if they had a relapse (clinically determined) or had taken steroids within the previous six months; •if they were currently taking antidepressant drugs or were using hyperbaric oxygen; •if they had used the trial treatment before; •if they were hypertensive or had cardiac disease; •if they were pregnant or not practising a reliable form ofcontraception;See end of article for authors’ affiliations .......................

The pretrial screening protocol included: a physical exam- ination and assessment on Kurtzke EDSS 11and GNDS,7an ECG, blood pressure measurement, and a blood sample for full blood count, urea and electrolytes, and vitamin B-12 level. Patients were given four weeks to consider their decision and if they agreed to continue then they had a baseline assessmentand were given a diary to record changes noted over the ﬁrsttwo weeks.They were then seen at weeks 2, 4, 12, and 24.Once a patient was registered, randomisation was under- taken centrally by Scotia Pharmaceuticals using a computerrandomisation procedure.Patients were randomised withincentres, but no other balancing factors were taken intoaccount.
The formal assessments used were the Kurtzke EDSS, 11the GNDS,79the Beck depression inventory,12the Chalder fatigue scale,13and the Gulick multiple sclerosis speciﬁc symptom scale.14The last four were recorded at each assessment point, but the Kurtzke EDSS was only recorded at baseline and at 24 weeks. The primary outcome measures were ﬁrst, the change in the total score on the GNDS from entry to 24 weeks, and second, the cumulative beneﬁt over time on the GNDS, taking intoaccount scores at each assessment.Statistics Data were collected by Scotia Pharmaceuticals.Each centreobtained permission from their local ethics committee for theFigure 1 Flow diagram of the study.

Initial power calculations using published data15and unpublished data supplied by Dr Sharrack suggested that 60 patients would be needed in each group to detect a difference of three points on the GNDS. We aimed to recruit 140 patients, assuming a 10% dropout rate.The primary statistical analyses compared the observed data between the two groups using appropriate parametric (ttest) or non-parametric ( χ2and Mann–Whitney) tests.All data were included, using the last observation carried forward if ﬁnal data were missing (that is, an intention to treat analy- sis).The effect of active treatment on the GNDS score was examined by ﬁtting a linear repeated measurements model to the post-treatment data.The covariates (other than the treat-ment group) included in the ﬁnal part of this model were: centre, multiple sclerosis disease type, smoking status (because anecdotal evidence suggested smokers respondedwell), sex, and baseline GNDS score.
Preliminary data analysissuggested that a “split plot” (constant correlations) modelwas appropriate for these data, ﬁtted by including a singlerandom effect for subject. The model was ﬁtted using the“1me” routine of S-Plus 2000.Two possible forms of treatmenteffect were tested.First, a model was ﬁtted which investigatedan increasing effect of treatment over time.However, this wasrejected in favour of the second, simpler model whichcontained only which treatment group the patient was in.Further analyses were undertaken to investigate two subsidiary questions.First, because there may have beenunexpected differences between the groups, analysis ofcovariance was used to allow for any differences using thepatient’s initial score and centre as covariates.Second, giventhat some patients stopped the treatment before completion,data from patients who took the treatment throughout werecompared (n = 113).RESULTS In all, 138 patients were entered into the study.
Figure 1 shows the ﬂow of patients through the study. The commonest reasonfor stopping the treatment was the occurrence of new symp- toms, which were often those of the underlying disease.Only four patients withdrew from follow up.T able 1 shows thebaseline characteristics of the two groups.There were no sta-tistically signiﬁcant differences between the groups at entry.At 24 weeks there was a reduction in the mean GNDS score (representing an improvement) in both groups, with little change in the Kurtzke score (table 2; ﬁg 2).The changes inscores were small in all measures, and none of the differencesbetween the groups was statistically signiﬁcant.The improve-ment seen over the ﬁrst two weeks was not signiﬁcant (pairedttest).Analysis of the repeated measures of the GNDS using the linear model showed a beneﬁt of 0.6 GNDS units in favour ofthe active treatment (p = 0.03), and the data suggest that thisbeneﬁt occurred within two weeks and remained constantthereafter.
Analysis of covariance of the change scores in all patients (that is, an intention to treat analysis) showed a possible effectof combination therapy in reducing fatigue by a small amount,but no other beneﬁt was found (table 3). Analysis ofcovariance restricted to treatment compliant patients alsoshowed that combination therapy might reduce multiple scle-rosis related symptoms (Gulick scale 14) and reduce deteriora- tion on the Kurtzke scale11(table 3).The majority of patients reported many adverse events, most of which were part of the normal ﬂuctuation in multiple sclerosis symptoms.
However, patients taking the combinationtreatment did experience more of the symptoms expectedfrom the drugs (table 4), suggesting that the medication hadsome physiological effect.Table 2 Change in scores at 24 weeks Combination group (n=67)Control group(n=67) GNDS score −3.6 (5.4) −2.3 (4.7) GNDS change: range (median) +8 to −19 (−3) +12 to −12 (−2) Beck depressioninventory −4.6 (8.4) [n=66] −3.3 (7.2) Multiple sclerosis symptom score −8.1 (14.2) [n=64] −3.7 (10.4) [n=65] Multiple sclerosisdisability score 0.9 (8.3) [n=66] 0.8 (8.3) [n=66] Fatigue scale −2.1 (3.4) −0.9 (4.0) Kurtzke EDSS 0 (0.8) 0.2 (0.5) Values are mean (SD) unless stated.

It was large enough to detect a clinically relevant decrease in disability. In contrast to most other current studies of treatments for patients withmultiple sclerosis, it included a wide spectrum of disability,with some very disabled patients, and covered a broad agerange.Compliance was good.The range of measures usedshould have detected any major beneﬁt in any one restricteddomain.There were some weaknesses.One potential criticism of this study is that it did not select the “correct” patients (that is, those who would beneﬁt).In the absence of any scientiﬁcbasis for the treatment and any published data to help identifysuch patients, this was not possible.An unvalidated checklistis available, but our study was not sufﬁciently large to allowthis to be further assessed.The study might be criticised asusing an inappropriate dose, but it explicitly tested the regime described in the lay press and used in Scandinavian practice.
6 We did detect side effects which might be anticipated from the component drugs, suggesting that the combination therapyhad some physiological effects. It is possible that the treatment helps certain speciﬁc symptoms or speciﬁc patients, but it was not powered to detect a selective or small beneﬁt.The results from the secondary analyses need to be interpreted very cautiously.The differences noted were small, the groups of treatment compliant patients are potentially biased, and when multiple comparisons are made somedifferences may arise through chance.At most one mightconclude that combination therapy reduces symptoms,including fatigue, by a very small amount, but not sufﬁcientlyto reduce disability or inﬂuence psychological state (asmeasured by reported symptoms or depression).This treatment study is one of the ﬁrst to use the Guy’s neurological disability scale 7as its primary outcome measure.
The GNDS is a new scale speciﬁcally designed for use in trials, and we have found it to be easy to apply and well accepted by patients. It represents a great improvement over the Kurtzke EDSS, which has been criticised for insensitivity.16 17A postal version of the GNDS is now also available.9Conclusions We conclude that there is insufﬁcient evidence to support theuse of this triple combination therapy routinely in patients with multiple sclerosis.There are trends suggesting some sympto- matic improvement, and a small beneﬁcial effect cannot beruled out.Consequently further studies may be justiﬁed.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We gratefully acknowledge Scotia Pharmaceuticals who provided all the necessary funding, took responsibility for all aspects of data collection,and undertook preliminary analysis.We speciﬁcally thank Dr G Cooper,Dr R Bryce, Ms K McGregor, Ms B Attwood, and Dr B Patel.
