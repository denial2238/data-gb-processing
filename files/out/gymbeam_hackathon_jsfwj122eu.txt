RUNX family transcription factor 2 (Runx2), a transcription factor, and collagen type I alpha 1 chain(COL1A1), the principal constituent of SMF, have been linked previously, with Runx2 shown to directly modulate COL1A1 mRNA levels. L-Carnitine, a marker of cancer cachexia, can alleviate ﬁbrosis in liver and kidney models; how- ever, its role in cancer cachexia-associated ﬁbrosis and the involvement of Runx2 in the process remain unexplored.Methods Female C57 mice (48 weeks old) were inoculated subcutaneously with MC38 cells to establish a cancer cachexia model.A 5 mg/kg dose of L-carnitine or an equivalent volume of water was administered for 14 days via oral gavage, followed by assessments of muscle function (grip strength) and ﬁbrosis.
To elucidate the interplay between the deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 3L(DTX3L)/Runx2/COL1A1 axis and ﬁbrosis in transforming growth factor beta 1-stimulated NIH/3T3 cells, a suite of molecular techniques, including quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analysis, co- immunoprecipitation, molecular docking, immuno ﬂuorescence and Duolink assays, were used. The relevance of the DTX3L/Runx2/COL1A1 axis in the gastrocnemius was also explored in the in vivo model.Results L-Carnitine supplementation reduced cancer cachexia-induced declines in grip strength ( >88.2%, P<0.05) and the collagen ﬁbre area within the gastrocnemius ( >57.9%, P<0.05).At the 5 mg/kg dose, L-carnitine also suppressed COL1A1 and alpha-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA) protein expression, which are markers of SMF and myo ﬁbroblasts.Analyses of the TRRUST database indicated that Runx2 regulates both COL1A1 and COL1A2.In vitro, L-carnitine dimin- ished Runx2 protein levels and promoted its ubiquitination.
Overexpression of Runx2 abolished the effects of L-carnitine on COL1A1 and α-SMA. Co-immunoprecipitation, molecular docking, immuno ﬂuorescence and Duolink assays con ﬁrmed an interaction between DTX3L and Runx2, with L-carnitine enhancing this interaction to promote Runx2 ubiquitination.L-Carnitine supplementation restored DTX3L levels to those observed under non-cachectic conditions, both in vitro and in vivo.Knockdown of DTX3L abolished the effects of L-carnitine on Runx2, COL1A1 and α-SMA in vitro.The expression of DTX3L was negatively correlated with the levels of Runx2 and COL1A1 in untreated NIH/3T3 cells.Conclusions This study revealed a previously unrecognized link between Runx2 and DTX3L in SMF and demonstrated that L-carnitine exerted a signi ﬁcant therapeutic impact on cancer cachexia-associated SMF, potentially through the up- regulation of DTX3L.

3The increase in SMF in pa- tients with cancer cachexia is accompanied by an increasein endometrial space, 3which is inconsistent in non-cachexic cancer patients.S1Thus, studying SMF is crucial to better identify cachexia and to monitor its progression. Dietary counselling, adequate nutritional support and physical exercise are currently the mainstays of treatment for cancer cachexia.
A systematic review of the effects of dif-ferent minerals, vitamins and other supplements on cancer cachexia by the European Palliative Care Research Centre showed that only L-carnitine (LC) was able to increase the median survival of patients with pancreatic cancer.4More- over, a decrease in the serum LC level was found to be a biomarker of sarcopenia, which was de ﬁned as the loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality and function in cancer patients.5Sarcopenia caused by anticancer drugs may also be reduced by LC, and it has been suggested that sorafenibmight inhibit carnitine absorption to induce sarcopenia. 6 Shang et al.showed that reducing SMF can attenuate sarco-penia in aging mice.7Many studies have demonstrated that LC can reduce the ECM in patients with liver, kidney and heart-related diseases.8–10However, the effects of LC on cancer cachexia-associated SMF are unclear.
LC supplemen-tation may represent a potential strategy for preventing or treating cancer cachexia-related ﬁbrosis. Collagen type I alpha 1 chain(COL1A1) is a key structural component of the ECM and the main component of SMF.11 Stilhano et al.showed that inhibiting the expression ofCOL1A1 alleviated skeletal muscle degeneration.12Ninted- anib, an EndMT-inhibiting drug, was shown to improve skeletal muscle function by decreasing the expression of SMF-related genes, such as COL1A1.13These studies suggest that reducing the expression of COL1A1 may alleviate SMF and thus reduce the muscle wasting and decreased muscle strength caused by cancer cachexia.RUNX family transcrip-tion factor 2 (Runx2) is a transcription factor that is consid- ered to be an osteogenic marker and a promising therapeutic target for malignant tumours.S2Ducy et al.
showed that Runx2 directly regulated the mRNA level of COL1A1.14An- other study indicated that Runx2 expression is upregulated during denervated muscle atrophy.15Recent researchshowed that Runx2 promotes aortic and aortic valve ﬁbrosis in models of type 2 diabetes and aging.S3,S4Transforming growth factor be (TGF- β1), which is a major factor driving ﬁ- brosis, is secreted by cancer cells and promotes the expres-sion and function of Runx2. 16Thus, there may be a relation- ship among TGF- β1, Runx2 and COL1A1 related to cancer cachexia-associated SMF.Deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 3Leltex-3-lik (DTX3L) belongs to the E3 ubiquitinase Deltex family.The previous research on DTX3L has mainly focused on tumours, where it has beenshown to be involved in cancer cell survival, proliferation, ap- optosis, metastasis and DNA repair.17Recently, several stud- ies have shown that the expression of DTX3L is associatedwith in ﬂammatory diseases.
S5Our previous research showed that LC alleviates the decrease in skeletal muscle mass and inﬂammation induced by cachexia in mice and activates the AKT (protein kinase B) pathway.18In support of this observa- tion, Hu et al. showed that silencing DTX3L inhibits the AKT pathway.19However, the effects of LC on DTX3L, the role of DTX3L in ﬁbrosis and their relationship with cancer cachexia-associated SMF are currently unclear.In this study, we explored whether LC could alleviate SMF and whether the mechanisms involved DTX3L, Runx2 and COL1A1.We believe our ﬁndings may provide new insights into cancer cachexia and the potential bene ﬁts of LC supplementation.Methods Mouse model of cachexia Cachectic mouse experiments were conducted according to aprotocol reviewed and approved by the Animal Ethics Com- mittee of the Army Medical University.The study adhered to all relevant regulations regarding animal research.
FemaleBALB/c nude mice (6 weeks old) and C57 mice (44 –48 weeks old) were obtained from the breeding animal facilities of the Army Medical University (Chongqing, China). The nudemouse model of cachexia has been described previously.18 Brieﬂy, six female nude mice were randomly assigned to con- trol (three) and LC (three) groups based on their bodyweight, and the cancer cachexia model was established by subcutaneously transplanting 5 × 10 6CT26 cells into the left ﬂanks of these mice.Sixteen C57 mice were allowed to accli- mate to the animal facility for 1 week and then were ran- domly assigned to a normal (four), MC38 (six) or MC38 + LC (six) group based on their body weight.A totalof 5 × 10 6MC38 cells in 0.1 mL of Dulbecco ’s modi ﬁed Ea- gle ’s medium (DMEM) without foetal bovine serum (FBS) were injected subcutaneously into the right inguinal area ofeach C57 mouse to induce cancer cachexia in these mice.The treatment (distilled water or 5 mg/kg LC) was adminis-1954 Z.Lu et al .

The body weight and tumour size were recorded every 3 days ( Figure S 1A).Cell lines and cell models CT26, HEK 293 and NIH/3T3 cells were purchased from Guangzhou Cellcook Biotech.The MC38 cells were obtained from Professor Ye Lilin at the Army Medical University.MC38 cells, CT26 cells, HEK 293 cells and NIH/3T3 cells werecultured in a 37°C incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2.MC38 cells, CT26 cells and HEK 293 cells were maintained in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.NIH/3T3 cells were maintained in high-glucose DMEM supple- mented with 10% newborn bovine serum (NBS).The secre- tion of TGF- βby cancer cells contributes to the onset of ﬁbro- sis in patients with cancer cachexia.20NIH/3T3 cells were inoculated into T25 culture ﬂasks and treated with a ﬁnal concentration of 10 ng/mL TGF- β1 (PeproTech, USA) for 24 h ( Figure S 1B).
Mouse grip strength assessment A mouse was placed on the board of a grip strength metre (Ugo Basile, type 47200, Italy), grabbed by its tail and gently pulled back with even force in a straight line. As the mouse was moved backwards, its limbs gripped the grabbing boarduntil the pulling force exceeded its grip strength.The display showed the maximum grip.The average of the three re- peated trials was recorded as the muscle strength of themouse.RNA sequencing analysis Total RNA was extracted from the gastrocnemius muscle ofthe two groups of nude mice using a commercial kit, and the subsequent sequencing analysis was performed by Majorbio (Shanghai).The differentially expressed genes(DEGs) threshold was a fold change >2 and a Pvalue<0.05 by DESeq2.
Histopathology of the gastrocnemius muscle The gastrocnemius muscles were ﬁxed in 4% paraformalde- hyde solution in 0.2 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by washing in PBS and subsequent staining withhaematoxylin and eosin (HE) solution. Subsequently, muscle sections were imaged using the ImageJ software.Sirius red staining The gastrocnemius muscles were stained using a Sirius RedStaining Kit (Double Jane; Shanghai, China).The gastrocne- mius muscle of the hind leg proximal to the tumour was re-moved and sectioned in paraf ﬁn and then treated with iron haematoxylin, Sirius red, 0.2% acetic acid, anhydrous alco- hol, xylene and dibutylphthalate polystyrene xylene.A mi-croscope was used to examine the tissue at ×100 magni ﬁca- tion.Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, USA) was used to measure the intensity of the Sirius red staining.
Transfection of plasmids and short interfering RNAs In the GFP-DTX3L or Flag-Runx2 overexpression experi- ments, the empty plasmid was used for mock transfection. For gene knockdown assays, scrambled control short inter-fering RNA (siRNA) and DTX3L-siRNA were made by RiboBio Company (Shanghai, China).Plasmid and siRNA transfection were carried out according to the manufacturer ’s instruc- tions for Lipofectamine 3000 (L3000015, Invitrogen).In brief, 7.5 μL of Lipofectamine 3000 was added to 250 μL of Opti-MEM medium (31985-070, Gibco).Then, 5 μgo f cDNA or 50 nmol of siRNA, 10 μL of P300 and 250 μLo f Opti-MEM medium were added to a new 1.5-mL eppendorf (EP) tube.The Lipofectamine 3000 and plasmid mixture wascombined at a ratio of 1:1.After 10 –15 min at room tem- perature, 250 μL of the mixture was added into each six-well plate of cells, which were incubated at 37°C for24 h.The cDNA and siRNA sequences for the target genes are listed in Table S 1.
Immuno ﬂuorescence assay Immuno ﬂuorescence assays were performed according to the standard protocol, as described previously.S6The HEK 293 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with GFP-DTX3L and Flag-Runx2 plasmids for 48 h. After being washed in PBS, the cells were ﬁxed for 15 min in 4% parafor- maldehyde.The cells were permeabilized in 0.1% TritonX- 100, washed and blocked with goat serum for 30 min.After blocking, the cells were incubated with an anti-Flag rabbitantibody overnight at 4°C, followed by washing with PBS and incubation with a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at 37°C.The coverslips were then incubated with1μg/mL 4 ′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI) for 5 min.Finally, the coverslips were washed and mounted using aqueous mounting medium (Santa Cruz, SC-24941).Isotype-speci ﬁc negative controls were included with each staining experiment.
The stained cells were mounted and vi-L-Carnitine targets muscle ﬁbrosis via DTX3L/Runx2 axis 1955 Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2024; 15: 1953 –1964 DOI: 10.1002/jcsm.13544 sualized under a Leica Stellaris STED (Leica TCS SP5, Germany). The antibodies used are listed in Table S 2.Duolink assay The processes before blocking were the same as for standard immuno ﬂuorescence, as described above.However, for the Duolink assays, the coverslip was blocked with Duolink®Blocking Solution (Sigma Aldrich, DUO9210) for 60 min at 37°C and then incubated with an anti-Flag rabbit antibody and an anti-GFP mouse antibody (Beyotime Biotechnology)overnight at 4°C.Next, the cells were incubated with PLUS and MINUS PLA probes for 1 h at 37°C, Duolink® Ligation Buffer for 30 min at 37°C and Ampli ﬁcation Buffer for 100 min at 37°C.
The coverslips were washed twice for 10 min per time at room temperature in Wash Buffer, and the slides were mounted with a coverslip using a minimalvolume of Duolink® In Situ Mounting Medium with DAPI. The stained cells were mounted and visualized under a Leica Stellaris STED (Leica TCS SP5).The antibodies used are listedinTable S 2.Western blot analysis Western blotting was performed according to the standard protocol, as described previously.S7Protein was extracted from the gastrocnemius of the hind leg distal to the tumour.NIH/3T3 cells exposed to different conditions were lysed in buffer (containing 1000 μL of cell lysate, 20 μL of phospha- tase inhibitor, 20 μL of protease inhibitor and 10 μLo f phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride or phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuo- ride [PMSF]) and then centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C.The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method was used to de-tect the protein concentration.Protein expression was analysed by western blotting.
Membranes were ﬁrst incu- bated with the primary antibodies, and then these mem-branes were incubated with the secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The results were visualized with the ChemiDocTouch ™Imaging System (BIO-RAD) and analysed using the Image Lab software.The antibodies used are listed in Table S 2.RNA sequencing and statistical analyses After excision, the left gastrocnemius muscles of nude mice were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and sent to Shanghai Majorbio Bio-pharm Technology Co.Ltd.In brief,RNA was extracted using the QIAzol Lysis Reagent (QIAGEN, Dusseldorf, Germany).Total RNA analyses were done using an Agilent 5300 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, California,USA).Library preparation of 1 μg of RNA was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq Reagent Kit (Illumina, California,USA).cDNA was evaluated, and sequencing was performed using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina).
The raw paired end reads were trimmed and quality controlledby fastp with default parameters. The differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 program.Molecular docking and ligand –target interactions The predicted structures of DTX3L and Runx2 were generated by Alphafold (Google, California, USA).We used AutoDock Vina (The Scripps Research Institute, California, USA) to per- form molecular docking.The Docking Web Server (GRAMM)(Center for Computational Biology, University of Kansas, USA) was used for protein –protein docking.Ligand –target in- teractions were calculated using AutoDock Tools 1.5.7 underdefault parameters.Finally, the protein –protein interaction ﬁgure was generated by PyMOL (Schrödinger, New York, USA).Co-immunoprecipitation assays A 20- μL aliquot of magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, USA) was washed in cold PBS and then put in 3% bovine se-rum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 4°C.Then, the magnetic beads were washed twice again with cold PBS.
A total of 500 μL of cell lysates were placed in the magnetic beads and incu-bated overnight on a shaker at 4°C. The magnetic beads were washed twice with tris-buffered saline (TBS) after removing the liquid with the magnetic frame.Then 2 × sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) was used to resuspend the magnetic beads, which were subsequently boiled in a 100°C water bath for 10 min.Supernatants were collected after removing the mag-netic beads from the magnetic frame.Quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted from NIH/3T3 cells using the TRIzolreagent and an Ultrapure RNA Kit (Cwbio, Taizhou, China).The cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription.qPCR was performed using SYBR Green (Bimake, Shanghai, China).Thestudy was repeated independently three times for each sample, and all ampli ﬁcation reactions were analysed using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method and normalizedto the GAPDH mRNA level.
All reactions utilized the following thermal cycler conditions: 95°C for 30 s, 39 cycles of a two-step reaction with denaturation at 95°C for 5 s and an-nealing at 59°C for 30 s. The primers for the genes are listed inTable S 3.1956 Z.Lu et al .Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2024; 15: 1953 –1964 DOI: 10.1002/jcsm.13544 Statistical analysis All values were presented as means ± SEM.Multiple groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a least signi ﬁcant difference (LSD) test, and comparisons be- tween two groups were conducted using t-tests by the SPSS soft- ware (Version 23.0; SPSS Software I n c .,C h i c a g o ,U S A ;I B M ,U S A ) .Pvalues<0.05 were considered statistically signi ﬁcant.
Results L-Carnitine relieves cancer cachexia-related skeletal muscle ﬁbrosis Our previous research demonstrated that LC alleviates cancer cachexia-related muscle wasting.18To further explore the effects of LC, we conducted RNA sequencing (RNAseq)on the gastrocnemius muscles of nude mice. As shown in Figure 1A, LC treatment reduced the mRNA level of members of the collagen family.Middle-aged (44- to 48-week-old) micewere used for initial studies because the skeletal muscles of middle-aged mice are more susceptible to loss and have greater dif ﬁculty recovering than those of young mice.Liu et al.previously found that the daily administration of 5 mg/ kg LC could maintain a normal serum concentration in a mouse model of cachexia.21Therefore, we administered 5 mg/kg LC to each mouse after established tumours had formed.
The muscle strength (as indicated by the grip strength) in the MC38 + LC group was similar to that in the normal group,and there were signi ﬁcant differences between these mice and the untreated MC38 group ( Figure 1B). The total and tumour-free weights of the mice were not signi ﬁcantly differ- ent; however, the results demonstrated that LC supplementa- tion effectively prevented weight loss in the cachectic mice in the MC38 experiment ( Figure S 1C–E).The gastrocnemius weight and cross-sectional ﬁbre area demonstrated that the administration of LC prevented muscle atrophy ( Figure S 1F, G).Moreover, the proportion of gastrocnemius collagenous ﬁ- bre area in the MC38 group was approximately two times higher than that in the normal and MC38 + LC groups ( Figure 1C).
Further supporting the impact of LC on collagen, the pro- tein expression of COL1A1 in the MC38 + LC group was similar to that in the normal group ( Figures 1Dand S1H), while the level in the untreated MC38 group was signi ﬁcantly higher. Based on the physiological concentration of LC in the skele- tal muscle of healthy humans,22the cells were treated with 600 mg/L LC.Treatment for 45 min reduced the TGF- β1-in- duced overexpression of COL1A1 ( Figure 1E).However, a lower concentration of LC did not lead to a signi ﬁcant reduction, and a higher concentration of LC did not lead to any further reduc-tion of COL1A1 ( Figure 1F).It has been shown that alpha- smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA), ﬁbronectin and vimentin aremarkers of the trans-differentiation of ﬁbroblasts to myoﬁbroblasts.23Treatment of the NIH/3T3 cells with LC for 60 min or 6 h also reduced the TGF- β1-induced overexpression ofα-SMA, ﬁbronectin and vimentin ( Figure S 1I).
Notably, treat- ment of the cells with LC resulted in a concentration-depen- dent decrease in the α-SMA protein level but no signi ﬁcant changes in ﬁb r o n e c t i no rv i m e n t i n( Figure S 1J). These results indicate that LC reduces the ﬁbrosis induced by cancer ca- chexia and maintains skeletal muscle function.L-Carnitine regulates collagen type I alpha chain 1 through RUNX family transcription factor 2to relieve ﬁbrosis Subsequently, we explored the pathways upstream of the colla- gen family to determine how LC was exerting its effects.Usingthe TRRUST database, we found that Runx2 is a key transcrip- tion factor that simultaneously promotes the expression of both COL1A1 and COL1A2 ( Figure S 2A).The study conducted by Raaz et al.
demonstrated that Runx2 has the ability to enhance the transcription of both COL1A1 and COL1A2.S3Further analysis of the ‘-omics ’data revealed a correlation index of 0.9952 be- tween COL1A1 and COL1A2 mRNAs ( Figure S 2B), and overex- pression experiments suggested that Runx2 plays a regulatory role for both COL1A1 and COL1A2 ( Figure S 2C), supporting that COL1A1 and COL1A2 may be regulated by the same transcrip- tion factor. As shown in Figures 2A,BandS2D, LC inhibited the increase in Runx2 protein induced by cancer in both thein vivo mouse model and ﬁbroblasts treated with TGF- β1.Treat- ment of the cells with a higher concentration of LC (1200 mg/L) did not have any further effect in vitro, suggesting that the nor-mal physiological level of LC is optimal to reduce ﬁbrosis ( Figure 2C).As Runx2 promotes the expression of COL1A1 mRNA,14we studied the effects of LC on Runx2-mediated COL1A1 mRNA ex-pression.
As expected, LC decreased the mRNA level of COL1A1 at 30 min, and this effect was abolished when Runx2 was over- expressed ( Figure 2D,E). Notably, the effects of LC on the COL1A1 protein were abolished b y the overexpression of Runx2 (Figure 2F).More importantly, the reduction of ﬁbrosis (as indi- cated by α-SMA expression) was assoc iated with the effects on Runx2 ( Figure S 2E).L-Carnitine promotes Runt-related transcription factor 2ubiquitination We then explored the mechanism by which LC affects Runx2 expression.Interestingly, we observed that LC treatment ac-tually increased the level of Runx2 mRNA ( Figure 3A).Hence, we examined whether the decreased protein expression of Runx2 was due to increased degradation.
Cycloheximide(CHX) is an inhibitor of protein synthesis, and MG132 is a pro- teasome inhibitor used to prevent protein degradation viaL-Carnitine targets muscle ﬁbrosis via DTX3L/Runx2 axis 1957 Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2024; 15: 1953 –1964 DOI: 10.1002/jcsm.13544 the ubiquitin-proteasome system. As shown in Figure 3B,C,L C promoted a decrease in Runx2 protein after treatment with CHX, and this effect was abolished after treatment withMG132, suggesting that LC may promote Runx2 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Further ubiquitination analysis indicated that LC increased the ubiquitination levelof Runx2 ( Figure 3D), supporting that LC increases the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Runx2.L-Carnitine regulates RUNX family transcription factor 2via deltex E 3ubiquitin ligase 3L The ubiquitination of Runx2 requires an E3 ubiquitinase.DTX3L, a known E3 ubiquitinase, was identi ﬁed to be upregu-lated based on the RNAseq data ( Figure S 3A).
A PyMOL analy- sis predicted the presence of multiple binding sites between DTX3L and Runx2, and the score for DTX3L –Runx2 was /C0651 based on their interaction forces, which is greater than the /C0400 typically considered a cut-off for interaction, indicating that there is a very high likelihood of an interaction betweenthe two proteins ( Figure S 3B). We therefore co-transfected GFP-DTX3L and Flag-Runx2 plasmids into HEK 293 cells and ob- served that there was indeed a direct interaction betweenDTX3L and Runx2 based on a co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) analysis ( Figure 4A).Immuno ﬂuorescence assays showed that DTX3L and Runx2 co-localized in cells ( Figure 4B), and Duolink experiments indicated that the space between DTX3L and Runx2 was <40 nm ( Figure 4C).Notably, treatment with LC in- creased the direct interaction between DTX3L and Runx2 ( Fig- Figure 1 L-Carnitine (LC) relieves cachexia-induced skeletal muscle ﬁbrosis (SMF).

The dot chart shows the relative COL1A1 protein expression. Representative images are shown, and images were assessed using the Image Lab software.The data are shown as the means ± SEM ( n= 3).A one-way analysis of variance (B –F) followed by the least signi ﬁcant difference test was used to compare data among groups (* P<0.05).1958 Z.Lu et al .Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2024; 15: 1953 –1964 DOI: 10.1002/jcsm.13544 ure4D).After knocking down DTX3L expression with siRNA, LC not only failed to reduce the protein expression of Runx2 but also promoted its increase ( Figure 4E).Meanwhile, siDTX3L knockdown also reduced the ubiquitination of Flag-Runx2,supporting that DTX3L is an E3 ligase for Runx2 ( Figure 4F).L-Carnitine relieves ﬁbrosis through the deltex E 3 ubiquitin ligase 3L/RUNX family transcription factor 2axis To determine the role of DTX3L in this model, we checked the expression of DTX3L in mice with cachexia.
As shown inFigures 5Aand S3C, DTX3L was expressed at an abnormal level in the cachexia model, while LC restored the protein level of DTX3L to the normal (control) level. Similar to Runx2,the DTX3L level was decreased by treatment with 600 mg/L LC for 60 min ( Figure 5B), and a higher concentration of LC(1200 mg/L) had no further effects on DTX3L expression (Figure 5C).As shown in Figure S 3D, there was a small in- crease in the mRNA level of DTX3L, similar to that observed for Runx2.These results suggest that DTX3L plays a role inthe response to LC and exhibits changes in expression that correspond to those in Runx2.Moreover, the effects of LC on the protein and mRNA expression levels of COL1A1 wereabolished when DTX3L was knocked down with miRNA (Figure 5D).This was similar to the effects of LC on α-SMA andﬁbronectin, but not vimentin ( Figure S 3E).
Subsequently, both DTX3L and Runx2 were overexpressed in NIH/3T3 cells to con ﬁrm whether LC alleviates ﬁbrosis through the DTX3L/Runx2 axis. As shown in Figure 5E, the effects of LC on the mRNA and protein expression of COL1A1 were more extensive when DTX3L was overexpressed.Similar results were observed for α-SMA ( Figure S 3F).These ﬁndings suggest that DTX3L is involved in the mechanism by which LC allevi- ates ﬁbrosis and imply that DTX3L regulates Runx2.Figure 2 L-Carnitine (LC) downregulates RUNX family transcription factor 2 (Runx2) to improve ﬁbrosis.(A) Western blot (WB) analysis of Runx2 ex- pression in the gastrocnemius of experimental mice.The bar graph shows the relative Runx2 protein expression ( n= 4, 6, 6).

Therefore, we hypothe- sized that TGF- β1 may disturb the DTX3L/Runx2 axis.As shown inFigure 6A, the protein expression of Runx2 decreased when DTX3L was overexpressed, and the expression increased after DTX3L was knocked down in cultures without TGF- β1.Similar results were also observed for the protein expression of COL1A1 and α-SMA ( Figure 6B).
However, the correlation be- tween the Runx2 and DTX3L proteins shifted from negative topositive when cells were treated with TGF- β1(Figure 6C). Treatment of cells with TGF- β1 led to similar effects on COL1A1 andα-SMA as DTX3L overexpression ( Figure 6D).These obser- vations suggest that LC partially corrected the DTX3L/Runx2 axis in the model of cancer cachexia-related ﬁbrosis ( Figure 6E).Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to provide evidence of the effects of LC on cancer cachexia-relatedmuscle ﬁbrosis and muscle strength.Muscle strength is an important indicator used to evaluate muscle status, and our previous clinical study demonstrated that grip strength is closely related to the mortality of patients with cancercachexia.
24,S8,S9Clinical studies support that supplemental LC is bene ﬁcial to maintain grip strength in haemodialysis patients.25However, supplemental LC did not improve grip strength in healthy elderly people.26These studies show that supplementing LC to provide a normal physiological concen- tration has a positive impact on grip strength in subjectsexperiencing a diseased state. SMF is considered a marker of muscular dystrophy and se- vere muscle damage 2and negatively correlates with grip strength.24,S10Previous studies have shown that LC decreases the degree of ﬁbrosis in liver, kidney and cardiac muscle in a variety of disease models.8,9In the present study, we found that LC relieved the SMF caused by cancer.In addition, our previous reports have shown that LC can also improve muscle mass loss in tumour-bearing mice.18Busquets et al.
demon- strated that LC exerts its bene ﬁcial effects on the myo ﬁbers in subjects with muscle wasting.27,S11Further investigations are required to explore the role of LC and its metabolites indifferent diseases that cause increased SMF expression. Previous studies have shown that LC may alleviate ﬁbrosis through pathways involving fatty acid desaturase (FADS) 1/2, Figure 3 L-Carnitine (LC) promotes RUNX family transcription factor 2 (Runx2) ubiquitination.(A) qPCR analysis of the Runx2 expression in NIH/3T3 cells following exposure to 10 ng/mL transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF- β1) for 24 h and after subsequent treatment with 600 mg/L LC for dif- ferent amounts of time.The bar graph shows the Runx2 mRNA expression ( n= 3).(B) Western blot (WB) analysis of the Runx2 expression in NIH/3T3 cells following exposure to 10 ng/mL TGF- β1 for 24 h in the culture medium (CM) or 600 mg/L LC for 5 min and treatment with 15 mg/L cycloheximide (CHX) for different times.

COL1A1 is a classic marker of SMF.13In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the expression of the COL1A1 gene can be reduced by a tyrosine kinase inhibi- tor, nintedanib, and this reduces the degree of SMF.13Ap r e - vious study in an osteoblast differentiation model also dem-onstrated that LC treatment affected the mRNA level of Runx2. 28We herein reported that DTX3L promoted Runx2 degradation following treatment with LC.Of note, it has pre-viously been suggested that the mechanism underlying the degradation of Runx2 differs based on the cellular circum- stances.For example, exposure to tumour necrosis factor- α (TNF- α) induces Runx2 degradation through Smurf1 and Smurf2.29Thacker et al.reported that Skp2 regulated the function of Runx2 by promoting its ubiquitination duringthe differentiation of HEK 293 and MC3T3-E1 cells into an os- teoblast phenotype.
30CHIP, as an E3 ubiquitin ligase of Runx2, also played a negative role during the differentiationof MC3T3-E1 cells into the osteoblast phenotype. Carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP) not only inhibits the differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells into the osteoblast phe-notype but also promotes the differentiation of cells into an adipocyte phenotype.31Interestingly, WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (WWP1) induces Runx2 ubiquiti- nation and degradation to inhibit bone formation, while WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (WWP2) pro-motes Runx2 ubiquitination to induce cell differentiation to- wards the osteoblast phenotype in HEK 293 and C3H10T1/2 cells.32,S12 The effects of TGF- β1 on Runx2 are complex.In mesenchy- mal precursor cells, TGF- β1 has been shown to upregulate the expression of Runx2, a key transcription factor in osteoblastdifferentiation.33TGF-β1 facilitates the phosphorylation of Runx2.
This post-translational modi ﬁcation plays a critical role in the subsequent activation of matrixmetalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), an enzyme implicated in bone resorption and remodelling. 34Furthermore, TGF- β1 en- hances the acetylation of Runx2, which is also essential forMMP-13 expression in osteoblasts.35Recent studies have re- vealed additional mechanisms through which TGF- β1 modu- lates the functions of Runx2.Yu et al.demonstrated thatTGF-β1 can inhibit the degradation of Runx2 in cancellous bone.36Kang et al.identi ﬁed histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) and histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) as crucial regulators that Figure 4 L-Carnitine (LC) relieves ﬁbrosis via deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 3L (DTX3L).(A) Western blot (WB) analysis of RUNX family transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and DTX3L in HEK 293 cells after treatment with a Flag-Runx2 and GFP-DTX3L plasmid for 24 h after enrichment for Flag or GFP by immuno- precipitation.

(E) A schematic representation of how L-carnitine promotes DTX3L to induce Runx2 ubiquitination to relieve cachexia-related skeletal muscle ﬁbrosis.1962 Z. Lu et al .Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2024; 15: 1953 –1964 DOI: 10.1002/jcsm.13544 suppress Runx2 function during osteoblast differentiation in the presence of TGF- β.37Moreover, other factors can also in- ﬂuence the acetylation state of Runx2.SIRT6, an NAD+-de- pendent deacetylase, has been shown to decrease the levels of acetylated Runx2, thereby facilitating the degradation of Runx2.38 In contrast, our results show that while DTX3L is also neg- atively correlated with Runx2, TGF- β1 changes the relation- ship between the two proteins.This may be because DTX3L,as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is an essential carrier for ubiquitin transport and may catalyse different types of ubiquitination, leading to different effects on the substrate.Lo et al.re-ported that DTX3L promoted ISG15-mediated ISGylation of li- pase (LIPG).
39ISGylation is a ubiquitin-like modi ﬁcation, and its classical role in cells is to maintain the stability of the sub-strate. Thus, it is possible that the DTX3L-induced modi ﬁca- tion of Runx2 may affect the stability of the protein and that the impact of DTX3L on Runx2 is regulated by other factors,such as TGF- β1.The relationship between MDM2 proto-on- cogene (MDM2) and p53 supports this possibility.The MDM2 protein functions as a ubiquitination enzyme forp53; however, its effects on p53 can vary under different conditions.40,S13,S14Pan and Chen discovered that MDM2 and MDM4 regulator of p53 (MDMX) collaborate to suppressp53 function in the absence of stress.Following DNA damage, p53 is activated and induces MDM2 expression, subsequently leading to the degradation of MDMX and further activation ofp53.S13Yin et al.
’sﬁndings suggest that MDM2 enhances the stability and activity of p53 by facilitating its transcriptional upregulation.S14There may be similar conditional regulation of Runx2 by DTX3L. In summary, our present studies have shown that supple- mentation to achieve a physiological concentration of LCcan improve the decreased muscle strength and increased ﬁ- brosis caused by cancer cachexia in C57 mice.This is the ﬁrst study to ﬁnd that DTX3L is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Runx2 in vitro.We also showed that LC regulates Runx2 ubiquitina- tion through DTX3L, leading to a decrease in COL1A1 and al- leviating SMF caused by cancer cachexia.Our study providesnew targets for the treatment of ﬁbrosis-related diseases and supports the use of LC supplementation for the treatment of cancer cachexia.
