Our objective was to compare consecutive-day versus alternate-day iron supplementation.
Methods In a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, young Swiss women (n = 150; serum ferritin ≤30μg/L) were assigned to: daily 100 mg iron for 90 d, followed by daily placebo for another 90 d (consecutive- day group) or the same daily dose of iron and placebo on alternate days for 180 d (alternate-day group). The study period was 24/11/2021 –10/8/2022.Co-primary outcomes, at equal total iron doses, were serum ferritin and gastrointestinal side effects; secondary outcomes were iron de ﬁciency and serum hepcidin.Compliance and side effects were recorded daily using a mobile application.Data were analysed using mixed models and longitudinal prevalence ratios (LPR).The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05105438).Findings 75 women were assigned to each group and included in the intention-to-treat analysis.Capsule adherence and side effect reporting was >97% in both groups.
At equal total iron doses, comparing consecutive-day and alternate-day groups, median serum ferritin was 43.8 μg/L (31.7 –58.2) versus 44.8 μg/L (33.8 –53.6) (P = 0.98), the LPR for gastrointestinal side effects on days of iron intake was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.38, 1.77; P < 0.0001), and medianserum hepcidin was 3.0 nM (IQR 2.0 –5.0) versus 1.9 nM (1.4 –2.9) (P < 0.0001). Iron de ﬁciency prevalence after 3 months was 5.5% versus 4.3% (P = 0.74) and after 6 months was 11.4% and 3.0% (P = 0.049).Interpretation At equal total iron doses, compared to consecutive day dosing of iron, alternate day dosing did not result in higher serum ferritin but reduced iron de ﬁciency at 6 months and triggered fewer gastrointestinal side effects.Funding Swiss National Science Foundation, Bern, Switzerland.Copyright Crown Copyright © 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).

102286 www.thelancet.com Vol 65 November, 2023 1Articles Hepcidin is the key systemic regulator of iron ab- sorption and homeostasis in humans5and elevated serum hepcidin reduces dietary iron absorption.6After the intake of oral iron supplements ( ≥60 mg), serum hepcidin peaks at 8 h, remains elevated at 24 h but not at 48 h, and therefore sharply lowers fractional iron ab-sorption (FIA) from consecutive, but not alternate daydosing. 6–8Two previous short-term stable iron isotope studies reported that iron absorption from oral supple- ments (60 –200 mg iron) was increased by ∼35–50% when given on the alternate day, compared to when given on the consecutive day.7,8Recent studies that investigated whether alternate day dosing of oral ironresults in higher iron stores and/or hemoglobin (Hb) were small, nonblinded, and/or had short treatment periods of 3 –8 weeks.
9–13 Intermittent oral iron supplementation may be associated with fewer GI side effects, but most studies have been nonblinded and accurate reporting of sideeffects is dif ﬁcult. 11,14Adverse side effects of oral iron are usually recorded retrospectively with questionnaires,15 but this method is subject to both recall bias and inac-curate recall.16Used prospectively, mobile applications that allow frequent self-reporting of side effects from medications have many advantages including higher recall accuracy.17To underpin side effects reporting,fecal calprotectin, a marker of gut in ﬂammation,18and serum intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), a marker of enterocyte damage,19can be measured to assess adverse effects of iron on the gut.3 Therefore, our study aim was to compare the effects of consecutive day versus alternate day oral iron sup-plementation (100 mg) on serum ferritin and GI sideeffects.
For this study, we speci ﬁcally developed a user- friendly mobile application, which allowed subjects to record GI side effects daily using simple forced-choicequestions. Comparing consecutive day dosing for 3 months to alternate day dosing for 6 months, our main hypotheses were that, at an equal total iron dose, alter-nate day dosing would result in: (1) lower serum hep- cidin and GI side effects; and (2) higher iron absorption and serum ferritin.Methods Study design and participants This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted at the ETH Zurich in Switzerland.We recruited healthy women from the students and staff ofthe ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich by email announcement and advertisement on social media.
In- clusion criteria were: female; age 18 –45 years; serumResearch in context Evidence before this study We initially searched PubMed using the search terms “iron supplementation ”OR“iron supplements ”OR“iron de ﬁciency ” OR“alternate iron ”, with no language or date restrictions. The date of our ﬁrst search was April 27, 2020, and our last search was on April 01, 2021.Many papers, reviews, guidelines andtextbooks recommend daily oral iron supplementation for thetreatment of iron de ﬁciency and iron de ﬁciency anemia.These generally recommended daily doses of 100 –200 mg iron given as three or four divided doses.
Stable iron isotopestudies showed that iron absorption was lower from consecutive day versus alternate day dosing and that iron absorption was inversely correlated with serum hepcidin.Several small, nonblinded, and short-term studies that compared consecutive day with alternate day iron supplementation reported similar or greater increases inserum ferritin and/or hemoglobin with alternate day dosing. Several studies reported that intermittent dosing (weekly or alternate day) might trigger less side effects compared todaily dosing but reporting of side effects in these studies wasdone retrospectively.We could ﬁnd no blinded studies with daily assessment of gastrointestinal side effects comparing alternate day versus consecutive day iron supplementation.Added value of this study To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled long-term intervention trial comparingalternate day versus consecutive day oral iron supplementation in iron depleted women.
Also, we are aware of no previous studies using a speci ﬁcally-designed mobile application to assess, on a daily basis, compliance and gastrointestinal side effects comparing alternate day versus consecutive day iron supplementation. Our design minimizedpotential bias from in ﬂammation and recent oral iron intake on the treatment effect on serum ferritin.We show that in iron-depleted women, compared to consecutive day dosing of iron, alternate day dosing providing the same total dose oforal iron had comparable ef ﬁcacy but triggered fewer gastrointestinal side effects.Implications of all the available evidence In general agreement with previous studies, our ﬁndings conﬁrm that providing oral iron on alternate days rather than on consecutive days does not result in higher serum ferritin but reduced iron de ﬁciency and is associated with lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.
In most women withiron de ﬁciency, speed of response is not critical but maintaining good compliance with oral iron supplements is difﬁcult. Alternate day iron dosing may be better tolerated by many women, and this will likely increase compliance andefﬁcacy.Articles 2 www.thelancet.com Vol 65 November, 2023 ferritin 30 μg/L or less (depleted iron stores); C-reactive protein (CRP) less than 5 mg/L (to exclude those with inﬂammation); hemoglobin (Hb) more than 11 g/dL (to exclude those with moderate-to-severe anemia); no ma- jor chronic disease; not pregnant or lactating; further inclusion criteria are in the Supplementary Material .Randomization and masking We randomly assigned participants to the two study groups using a computer-generated randomization list,which was generated independently by the Cantonal Pharmacy of Zurich.Randomization was done in blocks of six, which resulted in balanced numbers of partici-pants between groups throughout enrollment.
Group assignment was done by the study investigator usingstudy IDs given to the participants when enrolled. Sealed envelopes with study group allocation were kept by an independent study monitor.Group allocationremained concealed to the participants and investigators until study end and completion of the data analyses.Procedures Participants in the consecutive-day group received daily 100 mg iron as FeSO 4for 90 days, followed by daily placebo for another 90 days ( Fig.1 ).Participants in the alternate-day group received 100 mg iron as FeSO 4and placebo on alternate days for 180 days.
Participants in both groups received a designated kit packed by theCantonal Pharmacy with two labelled containers (A and B) containing 50 capsules each at baseline (day 0) and at 73 at visit on day 93: venipuncture, distribution of supplements 71 at visit on day 139: venipuncture338 women assessed for eligibility 188 excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria 150 women enrolled and randomly assigned 75 women included in the intention-to-treat analysis2 discontinued intervention: side effects 2 discontinued intervention: 1 side effects, 1 iron infusion 3 discontinued intervention: 1 adverse event, 2 lost interest70 at visit on day 93: venipuncture, distribution of supplements 67 at visit on day 139: venipuncture3 discontinued intervention: 1 pregnancy, 1 iron infusion, 1 lost interest 67 at visit on day 183: venipuncture, stool sample, return of supplements1 discontinued intervention: pregnancy70 at visit on day 183: venipuncture, stool sample, return of supplements75 women allocated to consecutive day group 75 at visit on day 0: venipuncture, stool sample, distribution of supplements 75 at visit on day 46: venipuncture 73 at visit on day 90: venipuncture, stool sample, return of supplements 2 discontinued intervention: 1 side effects, 1 lost interest 75 women included in the intention-to-treat analysis75 women allocated to alternate day group 75 at visit on day 0: venipuncture, stool sample, distribution of supplements 73 at visit on day 46: venipuncture 73 at visit on day 90: venipuncture, stool sample, return of supplements 67 at visit on day 186: venipuncture 70 at visit on day 186: venipuncture 22 at visit on day 301-332: venipuncture Fig.
1: Schematic representation of the study design . Enrolled women were randomly assigned to either the consecutive- or alternate-day study group.Participants in the consecutive-day group received daily 100 mg iron as FeSO 4for 90 days, followed by daily placebo for another 90 days.Participants in the alternate-day group received 100 mg iron as FeSO 4and placebo on alternate days for 180 days.Participants came fasting to the ETH for a morning study visit every ∼6 weeks for 6 months (days 0, 46, 90, 139, and 183), and for two additional visits 3 days following the midpoint and endpoint study visits (days 93 and 186).Participants from the alternate day group also came for a follow-up visit ∼4 months after the study endpoint visit.Articles www.thelancet.com Vol 65 November, 2023 3 study mid-point (day 93).
The consecutive-day group received two containers with iron capsules at baseline and two containers with placebo capsules at midpoint.The alternate-day group received one iron and one pla- cebo capsule container, both at baseline and midpoint. Participants were asked to consume one capsule perday, alternating between containers A and B, in both groups, following an individual study calendar indi- cating from which container the capsule should be takenfrom each day.We recommended the subjects consumethe capsules in the morning at least 1 h before breakfast with a dietary source of ascorbic acid, such as citrus fruit juice.Participants came fasting to the ETH for a morning study visit every ∼6 weeks for 6 months (days 0, 46, 90, 139, and 183), and for two additional visits 3 daysfollowing the midpoint and endpoint study visits (days 93 and 186) ( Fig.1 ).Participants from the alternate day group also came for a follow-up visit ∼4 months after the study endpoint visit.
At baseline, height and weight were measured. We collected venipuncture blood sam- ples (∼8 mL) at all study visits for assessment of Hb, iron, and in ﬂammation status.On days 0, 90 and 183, participants brought in a stool sample, which they had collected at home within 48 h of the visit.On days 90 and 183, participants returned the capsule containers forcapsule counts as a measure of compliance and a blood sample was collected.From days 90 –93 to 183 –186, participants did not consume any capsules, and veni-puncture was then done on days 93 and 186.This delay allowed us to use serum ferritin as an unbiased measure of body iron stores, as serum ferritin is acutely elevated,independent of body iron stores, for 2 days after a high dose of supplemental iron.6Along with serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), CRP, serum iron and total iron binding capacity(TIBC) were measured on days 93 and 186.
Hecidin, Hb, MCV (mean corpuscular volume), hematocrit and I- FABP were measured in the blood samples collected ondays 90 and 183. During the study, participants used a mobile appli- cation to record compliance and assess GI side effectsdaily.This application, entitled “FeStudy ”, working on Android and iOS systems, with a German or English version, was speci ﬁcally designed for this study.Using the mobile application, on a daily basis, participantsanswered forced-choice questions concerning the sup- plement intake (yes, no), time of intake (morning, af- ternoon or evening), condition of intake (with or withouta meal) and if they experienced any of four GI side ef- fects (nausea, constipation, diarrhea and/or stomach pain) after the intake (yes, no) and if yes, their severity(mild, severe).Missed data entries could only be completed within one day after the missed entry.
Data was stored on the personal device (mobile smartphone)and synchronized and stored on a server database at regular intervals. Stored data from the mobileapplication was monitored twice weekly by the study coordinator to examine compliance and side effects.Participants were prompted to take their capsules dailythrough the mobile application.Participants were con- tacted by email if, for at least three days, capsules were not consumed, application entries were missing and/orsevere GI side effects were reported.Iron capsules consisted of 100 mg elemental iron as pharmaceutical grade (P.Eur.7.2) anhydrous FeSO 4(Dr.Paul Lohmann GmbH & Co.KGaA, Lüneburg, Ger-many) and the excipients mannitol and syloid 244 in hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) capsules.Pla- cebo capsules contained only the excipients and wereidentical in colour, size, weight and shape.
Soho Flordis International Switzerland SA (Bioggio, Switzerland) manufactured the iron and the placebo capsules packedin containers of 50 capsules, and sent them to the Cantonal Pharmacy, where the containers were rela- belled and blinded. We measured Hb immediately after venipuncture, then centrifuged the blood at 3000 rpm at 20 ◦C for 10 min and stored the serum at −20◦C until the day of analysis.In serum, we measured ferritin, sTfR, AGP,CRP, serum iron and TIBC, hepcidin, and I-FABP.Calprotectin was measured in stool samples.Details of the analytical methods and reference ranges can befound in the Supplementary Material .Outcomes The prespeci ﬁed co-primary outcomes were serum ferritin and longitudinal prevalence of GI side effects, measured after three months in the consecutive-daygroup versus after six months in the alternate-day group, at equal total doses.
Secondary outcomes were prevalence of iron de ﬁciency, serum hepcidin, markers of iron status, CRP, AGP, I-FABP and calprotectin.Additional secondary outcomes were serum ferritin and longitudinal prevalence of GI side effects after three months in the consecutive-day group versus thealternate-day group, and after six months in the consecutive-day group versus the alternate-day group. Statistical analysis Our power calculation assumed a SD of 15 μg/L on ferritin based on data from previous iron supplemen-tation studies in our laboratory, a type I error rate of 5%and 90% power.We estimated a sample size of 40 participants per group would allow us to detect a clinically-relevant difference of 10 μg/L in serum ferritin after consecutive-day and alternate-day supplementation for three and six months, respectively.We anticipated a drop-out rate of 25%, resulting in a sample size of 53participants per group.
Because of the uncertainty about effect sizes and drop-outs, we increased our ﬁnal sample size to 75 participants per group, or 150 participants intotal. We con ﬁrmed this sample size by an effect-size calculation for LPR: given the sample size calculatedArticles 4 www.thelancet.com Vol 65 November, 2023 for SF (n = 150) and the mean (SD) longitudinal prev- alence from our previous study comparing consecutive day versus alternate day dosing, we were able todiscriminate an LPR = 1.32.7 Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS statistical programming environment (IBM SPSS Software,Version 28) and Microsoft Of ﬁce EXCEL 2016 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).Primary and safety analyses were per- formed on an intention-to-treat basis.Normally distrib-uted data were reported as mean (SD) and non-normallydistributed data were reported as median (IQR).
To assess the effects of consecutive and alternate day dosing and time on variables, we ﬁtted linear mixed models; details are found in the Supplementary Material .W ed i d not impute missing data. Post-hoc tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni step-down(Holm) correction.We estimated total iron absorption assuming 1 μg/L serum ferritin corresponding to 8–10 mg liver iron stores 20and calculated median total iron intake during the study in the two groups assuming median obligatory iron losses of 1.34 mg/day21as described in the Supplementary Material .L o n g i t u d i n a l prevalence ratios (LPRs) for GI side effects were calcu-lated and time-by-group effect on the occurrence of GI side effects was assessed, as described in the Supplementary Material .Pv a l u e s<0 .0 5w e r ec o n s i d e r e d statistically signi ﬁcant.The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05105438).

Median capsule adherence was 98.3% (IQR 95.3 –100.0) in the consec- utive-day group and 98.9% (96.0% –100.0) in the alter- nate-day group (P = 0.46). In the consecutive-day group, 95.2% (IQR 80.8 –99.3) of the capsules were consumed in the morning and 92.4% (72.4 –97.8) without a meal; in the alternate-day group, the corresponding values were 94.9% (IQR 75.6 –98.9) and 93.5% (85.8 –98.3), respectively.Baseline characteristics of the participants in the consecutive-day and alternate-day groups are shown in Table 1 .There were no group differences in any of the baseline variables.Baseline prevalence of iron de ﬁciency and anemia was 48.0% and 4.0% in the consecutive-day group and 46.7% and 5.3% in the alternate-day group.Hematological and iron status parameters during the study are shown in Table 2 .
At the end of treatment (90 days for the consecutive-day group and 180 days for thealternate-day group), median serum ferritin was 43.8 μg/L (IQR 31.7 –58.2) in the consecutive-day group versus 44.8 μg/L (33.8 –53.6) in the alternate-day group (P = 0.98) ( Table 2 ,Fig. 2 A) and iron de ﬁciency Consecutive-day (n = 75) Alternate-day (n = 75) Age, y 26 (21 –29) 24 (21 –28) BMI, kg/m221.7 (2.3) 21.3 (2.1) Vegetarian, n (%) 24 (32.0) 33 (44.0) Hemoglobin, g/dL 13.3 (0.8) 13.3 (0.8)MCV, ﬂ 90.1 (4.1) 90.8 (4.0) Hematocrit, % 41.3 (2.3) 41.6 (2.3) Serum iron, μmol 17.2 (11.2 –21.1) 14.7 (10.4 –17.8) TS, % 23.7 (16.2 –29.9) 20.4 (14.8 –25.0) Serum ferritin, μg/L 15.9 (9.0 –22.5) 15.8 (10.1 –21.9) sTfR, mg/L 4.9 (4.4 –5.9) 5.1 (4.4 –5.8) Body iron stores, mg/kg body weight 2.9 (0.2 –4.2) 2.6 (0.9 –4.4) Serum hepcidin, nM 0.6 (0.3 –1.3) 0.7 (0.4 –1.3) Iron de ﬁciency, n (%) 36 (48.0) 35 (46.7) Data are mean (SD), median (IQR), or n (%).

Serum ferritin was higher in the consecutive-day group than in the alternate-day group at 46 and 93 days (P < 0.01 for both); the reverse was true at 183 days (P < 0.0001) ( Table 2 ).

Inﬂammation markers at baseline and during the study are shown in Table 3 .There were no group-time effects on CRP, AGP, I-FABP or fecal calprotectin.The prevalence of systemic in ﬂammation was <8% in both groups throughout the study and did not differ between groups.Median (IQR) I-FABP was 24% higher in the consecutive-day group at 3 months compared toalternate-day group at 6 months; 712.8 (459.5 –921.3) versus 573.3 (444.5 –786.4) pg/mL (P = 0.22).
There was a signi ﬁcant time effect on fecal calprotectin, which increased from baseline to 6 months in both groups (P = 0.011) ( Table 3 ). The LPR for all GI side effects at the end of treatment in the consecutive-day group (0 –3 months) to the alter- nate-day group (0 –6 months) was 1.91 (95% CI: 1.71, 2.13; P < 0.0001) ( Table 4 ).The cumulative count of GI side effects over the 6 months in the study groups isshown in Fig.3 .A detailed description of the distribu- tion of GI side effects among participants is shown in theSupplementary Table 1S .The LPR for nausea, diarrhea and stomach pain, but not constipation, was higher at the end of treatment in the consecutive-day group (0 –3 months) to the alternate-day group (0 –6 months) (for all, P < 0.0001) ( Table 4 ).Stomach pain occurred much more frequently in the consecutive-day group compared to the alternate-day group (LPR 2.54(95% CI: 2.05, 3.14); P < 0.0001).
From 0 to 6 months,the LPR for side effects in the consecutive-day group compared to the alternate-day group was 1.20 (95% CI:1.08, 1.33; P < 0.00080). From 0 to 3 months, the LPR for side effects in the consecutive-day group comparedto the alternate-day group was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.50; P < 0.0001).In contrast, from 4 to 6 months, there was no difference in the LPR for side effects between thegroups (P = 0.070).Side effects decreased over time in the alternate-day group, with less side effects occurring from 4 to 6 months compared to 0 –3 months (P < 0.001), with a signi ﬁcant group-time effect (P = 0.030).The LPR for side effects on days of iron intake only was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.38, 1.77; P < 0.0001) in the consecutive-day versus alternate-day group.
Discussion Theﬁndings for our two co-primary outcomes are that, at equal total iron doses, comparing consecutive-day and alternate-day iron dosing in iron-depleted young women:1) median serum ferritin was 43.8 μg/L (31.7 –58.2) versus 44.8 μg/L (33.8 –53.6) (P = 0.98); and 2) the LPR for GI side effects on days of iron intake was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.38, 1.77; P < 0.0001). For our secondary outcomes,at equal total iron doses, comparing consecutive-day and alternate-day groups: 1) median serum hepcidin was 3.0 nM (IQR 2.0 –5.0) versus 1.9 nM (1.4 –2.9) (P < 0.0001) and 2) iron de ﬁciency prevalence after 3 months was 5.5% versus 4.3% (P = 0.74) and after 6 months was 11.4% and 3.0% (P = 0.049).
Our previous short-term stable iron isotope studies in iron-depleted women showed that FIA from oral iron doses ≥60 mg given 24 h after a preceding dose was decreased by 35 –45%, 6and that absorption was 34% higher when 60 mg of iron as FeSO 4was given on alternate days for 28 days versus on consecutive days for Fig. 2: Serum ferritin and serum hepcidin concentrations during the study in the consecutive-day and alternate-day oral iron sup- plementation groups.Serum ferritin (A) and serum hepcidin (B).The dots represent the medians, the error bars represent 95% con ﬁdence intervals, the horizontal line represents the comparison of the consecutive day group, day 90 versus alternate day group, day 183.Analysed by linear mixed models, with independent samples t-test and non-parametric tests for variables with signi ﬁcant group-time effects.Post-hoc tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni step-down (Holm) correction.
Serum ferritin adjusted for in ﬂammation.22Articles www.thelancet.com Vol 65 November, 2023 7 14 days.7Those absorption values are similar to our estimates of 36% greater absorption from alternate day dosing in the present study, derived from changes inserum ferritin. However, our data suggest that the in- crease in fractional absorption with alternate day dosing does not entirely offset the provision of half of the irondose: serum ferritin was higher in the consecutive-day group compared to the alternate-day group at 3 months (P < 0.01).Also, providing the same total iron dose viaalternate day dosing for 6 months did not result in agreater increase in serum ferritin than consecutive day dosing for 3 months.
Possible explanations for this could include: (i) higher obligatory body iron losses(1.34 mg/day in menstruating women 21) during 6 months versus 3 months, which blunted the effect of the same total iron dose given over twice the time; and/or(ii) the presumed gradual reduction in iron absorption as iron stores were replenished in both groups; in young women, dietary FIA plateaus at a serum ferritin of∼50μg/L, 24which is near the median serum ferritin achieved by both groups at the end of treatment. The signiﬁcant decrease in serum ferritin from days 90 –180 in the consecutive-day group no longer receiving ironsupplementation indicates that the population was in negative iron balance without supplementation; that is, their dietary iron intakes were not covering their basaliron losses.Recent randomized trials from India and Turkey reported greater or similar ef ﬁcacy of alternate day versus consecutive day iron dosing in women with iron deﬁciency anemia.
9–11But small numbers, shorttreatment periods (3 –6 weeks) and nonblinded study designs make these trials dif ﬁcult to interpret. In a recent randomized controlled double-blinded trial,anemic Indian men and women (n = 200) received either one tablet of iron as FeSO 4(60 mg) daily or two tablets of FeSO 4(120 mg) on alternate days as a single morning dose for 8 weeks.13There was no group dif- ference in mean change of Hb at 8 weeks (P = 0.47).In a parallel group study, male and female endurance-trained runners (serum ferritin <50 μg/L) received 105 mg iron as FeSO 4either on consecutive or on alternate days for 8 weeks12; although the alternate-day group received half the iron dose, there were no groupdifferences in serum ferritin throughout the study.We previously showed that after the intake of oral iron doses ≥60 mg, serum hepcidin peaks at 8 h and remains elevated at 24 h, but not at 48 h.
Also, serum hepcidin was increased during dosing of 60 mg given on consecutive days for 14 days versus on alternate days for28 days. 7In this study, we show that this effect is pre- sent over 3 months of consecutive day iron doses: serum hepcidin was higher in the consecutive-day compared tothe alternate-day group at 46 and 90 days (P < 0.0001and P < 0.001, respectively) ( Fig.2 B).
However, because serum hepcidin is upregulated by acute iron doses and increased circulating iron concentrations as well asincreased liver iron stores, the higher serum hepcidin in the consecutive-day group may have been due to both the acute effect of consecutive day dosing and a greaterincrease in body iron stores in this group during the ﬁrst 3 months.Variable Day 0 Day 46 Day 93 Day 139 Day 186 Group effect P valueTime effect P valueGroup-time effect P value n Consecutive-day 75 73 73 69 70 NA NA NAAlternate-day 75 70 70 64 67 CRP, mg/L Consecutive-day 0.47 (0.20 –1.10) 0.61 (0.27 –1.44) 0.56 (0.26 –1.19) 0.34 (0.16 –1.25) 0.40 (0.21 –0.74) 0.46 0.50 0.61 Alternate-day 0.42 (0.21 –1.26) 0.42 (0.24 –0.87) 0.36 (0.20 –0.76) 0.34 (0.13 –0.94) 0.33 (0.13 –0.82) AGP, g/L Consecutive-day 0.66 (0.55 –0.74) 0.62 (0.55 –0.74) 0.64 (0.55 –0.75) 0.62 (0.55 –0.71) 0.62 (0.55 –0.70) 0.25 0.16 0.47 Alternate-day 0.64 (0.52 –0.78) 0.58 (0.52 –0.68) 0.60 (0.51 –0.70) 0.61 (0.55 –0.71) 0.61 (0.52 –0.69) Systemic in ﬂammation, n (%) Consecutive-day 4 (5.3) 2 (2.7) 2 (2.7) 4 (5.8) 3 (4.3) NA NA NAAlternate-day 5 (6.7) 1 (1.4) 2 (2.9) 5 (7.8) 3 (4.5) I-FABP, pg/mL Consecutive-day 710.1 (449.8 –1003.7) – 712.8 (459.5 –921.3) – 612.5 (400.0 –887.3) 0.76 0.055 0.57 Alternate-day 733.5 (537.6 –873.7) – 667.0 (465.3 –946.7) – 573.3 (444.5 –786.4) Fecal calprotectin, μg/g Consecutive-day 5.9 (3.6 –5.9) – 7.7 (4.2 –33.6) – 8.4 (3.9 –26.5) 0.16 0.011 0.63 Alternate-day 5.7 (3.3 –13.8) – 7.2 (4.0 – 13.3) – 8.5 (3.6 –16.6) Data are mean (SD), median (IQR), or n (%).

Another meta-analysis of six studies reported that women takingiron supplements intermittently (one, two or three timesa week, on non-consecutive days) were less likely to experience any side effects compared to women taking iron supplements on a daily basis (RR 0.41, 95% CI0.21 –0.82; 1166 participants). 25Other studies comparing consecutive day and alternate day dosing have reported fewer GI side effects with alternate day dosing,7,11but not all studies agree.9,10However, many studies that reported GI side effects with oral iron supplementation were limited by lack of blinding,9–12and/or by long pe- riods of recall.9–11In contrast, our study was carefully double-blinded, and using a novel, speci ﬁcally-designedmobile application, we were able to assess side effects daily, in ‘real time ’.Thus, we feel our side effect data are accurate and con ﬁrm that alternate day dosing is asso- ciated with fewer GI side effects.
Notably, there was a signi ﬁcant between-group dif- ference in GI side effects only during 0 –3 months, but not from 4 to 6 months. Because the consecutive-day group received placebo from 4 to 6 months, this sug-gests alternate day dosing produces minimal GI sideeffects; the presence of GI side effects in the consecu- tive-day group during the 3-months placebo phase is a reminder that GI symptoms are common and occur formany reasons.To provide objective evidence of effects of iron on the gut, we measured serum I-FABP as a measure of enterocyte integrity and fecal calprotectin asa measure of gut in ﬂammation.However, similar to the ﬁndings in our shorter iron absorption study comparing consecutive and alternate day dosing, 7we did not ﬁnd any signi ﬁcant between-group differences in these bio- markers.

Reception of the applicationwas overwhelmingly positive. A recent review reportedmultiple bene ﬁts of mobile apps for side effect report- ing 17and the use of the mobile app likely improved adherence and reporting accuracy in our study.This study has several strengths.The study was rigorously double blind and capsule adherence was veryhigh.Our design allowed us to assess the intervention effect in two ways: comparing the same treatment length with different total iron doses, and the same totaliron dose with different treatment lengths.However, it did not allow us to compare the same total iron dose given over the same treatment length.Future studiescould be done to compare equal total doses given over Fig.3: Mean cumulative count of side effects during the study in the consecutive-day and alternate-day oral iron supplementation groups.
Mean cumulative number of side effects per person (A), mean cumulative number of mild side effects per person (B), mean cumulative number of severe side effects per person (C) and mean cumulative number of side effects per person only on the days of iron intake (D). Thelongitudinal prevalence ratio (LPR) for all side effects in the consecutive-day group compared to the alternate-day group was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.33; p < 0.00080).The LPRs for mild and severe side in the consecutive-day group compared to the alternate-day group was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.35; P = 0.002) and 1.17 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.57; P = 0.30), respectively.The LPR for side effects only on the days when iron was taken in theconsecutive-day group compared to the alternate-day group was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.38, 1.77; P < 0.0001).Articles 10 www.thelancet.com Vol 65 November, 2023 the same treatment length by doubling the dose given on the alternate day.This study also has limitations.
Because the subjects were prompted by the mobile appto take their supplements, adherence was high in both groups; without these daily reminders, adherence may have varied. Only a small number of our participantswere mildly anemic; we did not study women with moderate-to-severe anemia, who might respond differ- ently to those with no anemia or mild anemia.Ourﬁndings show that, compared to consecutive day dosing of iron, alternate day dosing did not result in higher serum ferritin but led to a reduction in iron deﬁciency at 6 months and triggered fewer GI side ef- fects.It appears the increase in FIA with alternate day dosing does not fully offset the halving of the iron dose per unit time, so alternate day dosing reduces total ironabsorption per unit time compared to consecutive day dosing.This may not be optimal in women with symptomatic iron de ﬁciency anemia, in whom rapid repletion of body iron is needed.
Nevertheless, in most women with iron de ﬁciency, speed of response is not critical, 27but maintaining good compliance with oral iron is dif ﬁcult. Alternate day iron dosing will likely be better tolerated by many women, and this may increase compliance and ef ﬁcacy.Contributors HKS, DM, MBZ and NUS conceived the studies and obtained funding;all authors contributed to the design of the trials; HKS, SG, UMK, JS, FV and NUS conducted the studies; HKS, MBZ and NUS analyzed the data and wrote the ﬁrst draft of the manuscript; and all authors contributed to theﬁnal version of the manuscript.Data sharing statement Data described in the manuscript will be made available upon reason- able request.Declaration of interests The authors declare no competing interests.Acknowledgements The authors thank the participating subjects and nursing staff, and S.Camarena-Arguelles (ETH Zurich) for assistance in the study and Dr.Valeria Galetti for assistance in data analysis.
