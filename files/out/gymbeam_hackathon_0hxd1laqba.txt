A similar feature was described in athletes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which complicatesthe diagnosis for clinicians.In this context, we aimed to compare the LV function of the 2 populations by measuring global and regional strain and myocardial work using speckle-tracking imaging.Methods : Twenty-four strength-trained asymptomatic athletes using AAS (AAS-Athletes), 22 athletes diagnosed with HCM (HCM-Athletes), and 20 healthy control athletes (Ctrl-Athletes) underwent a resting echocardiography to assess LV function.We evaluated LV global andregional strains and myocardial work, with an evaluation of the constructive work (CW), wasted work, and work efﬁciency (WE).
Results : Compared to Ctrl-Athletes, both AAS-Athletes and HCM-Athletes had a thicker interventricular septum, with majored values in HCM-Athletes. LV strain was reduced in AAS-Athletes and even more in HCM-Athletes.Consequently, global WE was signiﬁcantly diminished in both AASand HCM-Athletes (93% §2% in Ctrl-Athletes, 90% §4% in AAS-Athletes, and 90% §5% in HCM-Athletes (mean §SD); p<0.05).Constructive work and WE regional analysis showed speciﬁc alterations, with the basal septal segments preferentially affected in AAS-Athletes, and both septal and apical segments affected in HCM-Athletes.Conclusion : The regional evaluation of myocardial work reported speciﬁc alterations of the major LV hypertrophy induced by the regular use of AAS compared to the LV hypertrophy due to HCM.This ﬁnding could help clinicians to differentiate between these 2 forms of pathological hypertrophy.

Introduction TaggedEnd TaggedPIntensive exercise training is associated with numerous morphologic and functional changes known as exercise- induced cardiac remodeling.1These physiological adaptations, consecutive to intermittent increased hemodynamic load, arecharacterized by mild morphologic cardiac changes and do notraise clinical concern.2However in some athletes, left ventric- ular (LV) remodeling is more pronounced and can raise thesuspicion of a pathologic adaptation, either due to use of performance-enhancing drugs or due to an underlying geneticcardiac disease.3,4Moreover, previous investigations deﬁned a “gray zone” in which it is difﬁcult for clinicians to distinguishbetween the extreme expressions of exercise-induced cardiacremodeling and a mild pathological or drug-inducedphenotype.

3,19These structural and functional abnor- malities can produce fatigue, dyspn ea, chest pain, palpitations, and syncope. Sudden cardiac death represents the most devas- tating presenting manifestati on, especially in young patients.TaggedEnd TaggedPThe purpose of the present study was to compare the regional function of pathological hypertrophy of strength-trained athletesreporting long-term and regular use of AAS with that ofathletes diagnosed with HCM.They were compared withhealthy highly-trained athletes with physiological LV hyper-trophy.Importantly, recent development of echocardiography proposes to evaluate myocardial work as an innovative and non-invasive method for measuring myocardial performance.It requires a combination of longitudinal strain and non-invasive blood pressure measurements to obtain pressure /C0 strain loops during the cardiac cycle, 20/C022and, thus, represents a more accurate assessment of myocardial function by consid-ering cardiac afterload.
22It differentiates myocardial construc- tive work (CW) and myocardial wasted work (WW) to estimate myocardial work efﬁciency (WE) and can be assessed regionally. We hypothesized that (a) the 2 forms of pathologi-cal remodeling would be associated with a decrease inmyocardial CW and a decrease in myocardial WE, and (b)regional alterations would be different between pathologicalremodeling induced by athletes reporting AAS consumptionand athletes with HCM.TaggedEnd TaggedH12.Materials and methods TaggedEnd TaggedH22.1.Study populations TaggedEnd TaggedPTwenty-four strength-trained asymptomatic athletes actively taking AAS (AAS-Athletes), and who were known toparticipate in bodybuilding competitions, were recruited inFrench gymnasiums.The inclusion criteria required a traininghistory of at least 5 h of training per week for a minimum of 5 years.
To be included in this study, AAS-Athletes needed to self-report a documented history of AAS use for at least 3courses of 2 weeks in the past 2 years. All were on drugs, i.e ., had administered their last AAS dose during the past 2 days.TaggedEnd TaggedPTwenty-two athletes with HCM (HCM-Athletes) were retrospectively selected from a large database of the RegionalCompetence Center of Genetic Disease (Rennes Hospital,Rennes, France).We included only asymptomatic athletes with a moderate wall thickness hypertrophy (13 /C020 mm).The preliminary cardiac investigations resulting in the diagnosiswere conducted during a period when these athletes were still actively engaged in competitive sports and before any decisionregarding disqualiﬁcation or cessation of exercise.
HCM, espe-cially in the case of borderline gray-zone wall thickness(13/C015 mm), was diagnosed in the context of a combination of features, including (a) identiﬁcation of HCM in a ﬁrst-degreerelative or an established pathogenic gene mutation; (b) nonconcentric patterns of LV hypertrophy (especially apical hypertrophy); (c) dynamic LV outﬂow tract obstruction; (d)late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance;or (e) atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. 3In this group, each subject underwent clinical examination, standard and speckle-tracking 2D-transthoracic echocardiography, late gadoliniumenhancement by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, 48-hHolter monitoring, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing to diagnose HCM, according to current guidelines.23Exclusion criteria were as follows: obstructive cardiomyopathy at rest,concomitant moderate or severe valvular heart disease,myocardial storage disease, hypertension, coronary arterydisease, or left bundle branch block.
TaggedEnd TaggedPTwenty healthy athletes (Ctrl-Athletes) from endurance (n= 10) or strength ( n= 10) activities serving as controls were prospectively included. Ctrl-Athletes had a self-reported history of never taking AAS or other doping substances and a training history of at least 5 h of training per week for aminimum of 5 years.TaggedEnd TaggedPExclusion criteria for Ctrl-Athletes and AAS-Athletes were congestive heart failure, moderate or severe valvular heartdisease, hypertension, respiratory or metabolic disorders, oractive cigarette smoking.All subjects included in the studywere aged 18 /C050 years.The study was conducted in accor- dance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Associa- tion as laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and reviewedby an independent committee.The inclusion of AAS-Athleteswas approved by the French Ethics Committee in SportsScience (CERSTAPS n˚2018-04-10-28).All patients gavetheir written informed consent to participate in the study.

24To assess LV mechanical dispersion, the maximum delay was calculated as the difference betweenTTP (in ms) of the last and the ﬁrst segment reaching theirpeak strains over the 18 segments (Maximum delay 18S).27,28 The standard deviation (SD) of the TTP (in ms) over the 18 segments was also calculated (SD 18S). TaggedEnd TaggedP2.3.3.Myocardial work quantiﬁcation TaggedEnd TaggedPMyocardial work and related parameters were estimated using the Automatic Function Imaging (AFI) of the Echo PACsoftware (Version 203; GE Healthcare).Myocardial work wasestimated as a function of time throughout the cardiac cycle bythe combination of LV strain data (recorded on the apical 4-,3-, and 2-chambers views) obtained by STE and a non-inva-sively estimated LV pressure curve as previously describedand validated.
20,21,29Peak arterial pressure measured a few minutes before the echocardiography with a cuff-manometer was assumed to be equal to peak systolic and diastolic LVpressures and to be uniform throughout the ventricle. 20 Myocardial work was then quantiﬁed by calculating the rate ofsegmental shortening by differentiating the strain curve andmultiplying the resulting value by the instantaneous LV pres-sure.The result was integrated over time to obtain myocardialwork as a function of time.TaggedEnd TaggedPMyocardial work was calculated from mitral valve closure until mitral valve opening as previously described.22,29The work performed by the myocardium during segmental short-ening represents CW, whereas the work performed by themyocardium during stretch or segmental lengthening repre-sents the energy loss, which is deﬁned as WW.The workperformed by the myocardium during segmental shortening,which does not promote LV relaxation, was considered segmental WW.
On the other hand, the work performed by the myocardium during segmental lengthening was consideredsegmental CW. Ultimately, the global or segmental WE wasobtained as follows: WE¼ CW CWþWW/C2100 TaggedEnd TaggedPStrain and myocardial work evaluation was done by a single investigator.We selected 30 subjects at random forthe assessment of intraobserver reproducibility of the regional and myocardial work parameters.Measurementswere made 48 h apart on the same echocardiographicimages.For global parameters, intraobserver reliability wasgood, with a coefﬁcient of variation of 1.2% and 2.8% forglobal WE and global CW, respectively.Finally, forregional parameters, intraobs erver reliability was good as well, with a coefﬁcient of variation of 2.9% for regional WE (from 1.5% on the mid-septal segment to 5.1% on the basalanterior segment) and a coefﬁcient of variation of 8.5% forregional CW (from 5.7% on the mid-septal segment to12.1% on the basal anterior segment).TaggedEnd TaggedH22.4.

However, the global WE was signiﬁcantly reduced in both AAS-Athletes and HCM-Athletes compared to Ctrl-Athletes(Fig. 2 D).Signiﬁcant correlations were found between SD 18S (index of LV mechanical dispersion) and global WE (Fig.3 A) and global CW ( Fig.3 B) as well as between EF and global WE ( Fig.3 C).TaggedEnd TaggedPThe regional CW and WE calculated over the 18 segments of the LV are presented in Fig.4 .Compared to Ctrl-Athletes, AAS-Athletes exhibited a drop of CW on 3 basal segments (basal inferoseptal, basal anterior, and basal anteroseptal), whileHCM-Athletes had lower CW on 1 basal segment (basal antero-septal), 3 mid-wall segments (mid inferoseptal, mid anterolat-eral, and mid anterior), and 5 apical segments (apical lateral,apical anterior, apical inferolateral, apical lateral, and apicalanterior).

LV morphology and global function TaggedEnd TaggedPThe populations of the present study were rigorously selected. The Ctrl-Athletes and AAS-Athletes reported manyyears of training with more than 5 h of practice per week.AAS-Athletes were included only if they reported regular high doses of AAS consumption for several years.Interestingly, weobserved a major hypertrophy in this group compared toCtrl-Athletes, conﬁrming the additional effect of AAS.Indeed,it has been demonstrated that AAS exposure at supraphysio-logic doses stimulates cardiomyocytes hypertrophy.30 HCM-Athletes were retrospectively selected from a large data-base of athletes diagnosed with HCM, 31from whom we chose only young athletes with moderate wall-thickness hyper- trophy.32Despite these speciﬁc inclusion criteria, HCM- Athletes exhibited signiﬁcantly higher maximum septal thick-ness compared to Ctrl-Athletes and AAS-Athletes.
TaggedEnd TaggedPThe LV remodeling of athletes consuming high doses of AAS was associated with a decrease in LV systolic and diastolicfunctions. 4,9Our AAS-Athletes showed lower EF and E wave compared to both other groups, with lower GLS despite values not reaching statistical signiﬁcance ( p= 0.08).In HCM-Athletes, results were different because EF remained unchanged and GLSwas reduced—a ﬁnding that has been frequently observed else-where 33/C035and that is potentially explained by the compensatory increase of LV circumferential strain in HCM patients, ass u g g e s t e db yS t o k k ee ta l .36TaggedEnd TaggedPIn the present study, we used the recently developed nonin- vasive technique of myocardial work estimation, which inte- grates LV strains and LV intraventricular pressure curves during the cardiac cycle.
Neither the negative work duringsystolic lengthening nor the positive work during post-systoliccontractions in a dyssynchronous ventricle makes a contribu-tion to CW and LV ejection; therefore, both are consideredwasted energy. Our results indicated that global CW waslower in HCM-Athletes compared to the other groups.GlobalWW seemed slightly higher in AAS-Athletes compared to Ctrl-Athletes, but the difference failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance.As a result, global WE was lower in both AAS-Athletes and HCM-Athletes compared to Ctrl-Athletes.Inathletes using AAS and in patients diagnosed with HCM,previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or post-mortemstudies provided evidence that cardiac remodeling is associ-ated with an increase in myocardial ﬁbrosis, 7,37which has adverse effects on myocyte excitability, cell-to-cell coupling, and the regulation of intracellular calcium.These myocardial adverse alterations could increase mechanical dispersion andTaggedFigure Fig.2.

41The lower WE observed in our AAS-Athletes, similar to that observed in ourHCM-Athletes, offers additional evidence of a pathological LV remodeling in relatively young athletes using AAS. Oursigniﬁcant (but moderate) correlation between global WE andSD 18Ssuggests that an increase in mechanical dispersion could be partly responsible for the lower WE observed in our AAS-and HCM-Athletes.TaggedEnd TaggedH24.2.LV regional myocardial work TaggedEnd TaggedPWe used a regional analysis of strains and myocardial work, which might be helpful in identifying the speciﬁc differences of LV hypertrophy related to AAS consumption or to HCM.Indeed, previous studies showed the usefulness of regionalanalysis in diagnosing various pathological conditions inpatients, such as HCM, 42or in response to cardiac resynchro- nization therapy.43LV strains were decreased on 2 segments in AAS-Athletes and on 8 segments in HCM-Athletes.
Similarresults were observed on TTP strains, since 1 segment wasdelayed in AAS-Athletes and 6 were delayed in HCM- Athletes, suggesting that more segments were altered in HCM- Athletes than in AAS-Athletes. TaggedEnd TaggedPAnalysis of LV peak strains is inherently limited because both intra-ventricular pressure and residual myocardial contractionafter ejection are not considered.However, these limitations areovercome with myocardial work analysis.21Interestingly, our results strongly supported regional differences between AAS- andHCM-Athletes.In AAS-Athle tes, both CW and WE were signiﬁ- cantly reduced on 3 segments localized at the basal-septal level, whereas in HCM-Athletes they w ere diminished both on apical and septal segments, in line with the location of their HCM.Recently, with a concomitant evaluation of myocardial work byechocardiography and of myocardial ﬁbrosis by magnetic reso-nance imaging, Galli et al .
40showed an association between CW decrease and presence of inters titial ﬁbrosis. Previous post- mortem studies reported ﬁbrosis de velopment predominantly situ- ated on the interventricular septum of AAS-users,7,8which could explain the drop of CW in AAS-users.Furthermore, our bullseyesshowed an increase of myocardial work heterogeneity from Ctrl-Athletes to HCM-Athletes: Ctrl-Athletes exhibited a base-to-apexmyocardial work gradient, which was less present in AAS-Athletes and totally abolished i n HCM-Athletes.Taken together, these results showed that AAS consumption led to speciﬁcregional dysfunctions that were di stinct from those observed in HCM-Athletes.The evaluation of regional myocardial work, a novel approach to assess the myocardial function, might helpclinicians to distinguish the car diac remodeling of athletes who are using AAS from those who are suffering from HCM, incomplement with genetic analysis in selected cases.44TaggedEnd TaggedH24.3.
Study limitations TaggedEnd TaggedPThe study population was relatively small, but AAS- Athletes and HCM-Athletes were rigorously selectedaccording to our inclusion criteria. Ctrl-Athletes and HCM-Athletes practiced endurance, strength, or mixed sports,whereas AAS-Athletes practiced only strength exercises because the use of AAS was mainly observed in strength activ- ities as a way of improving muscle mass.6Despite theTaggedFigure Fig.3.Correlations between myocardial work parameters and left ventricular function or mechanical dispersion parameters.(A) The correlation between global WE and SD 18S, (B) the correlation between global constructive work and the SD of time to peak strains over the 18 segments, and (C) the correla- tion between the WE and the EF.AAS = anabolic androgenic steroids; Ctrl = control; CW = constructive work; EF = ejection fraction; HCM = hyper-trophic cardiomyopathy; SD 18S= standard deviation of time to peak strains over the 18 segments; WE = work efﬁciency.
TaggedEndTaggedEndMyocardial work in pathological athlete’s heart 483 recruitment of strength-trained athletes reporting extended use/ abuse of high doses of AAS was very difﬁcult, we included arelatively large population of bodybuilders from many gymna-siums. Inevitably and for ethical reasons, information about the intake of AAS was self-reported, and the type of drugs and dosages differed between athletes.Other studies on strength-trained athletes using AAS are needed, especially to link thedrop in their LV myocardial work with the likely increase inmyocardial ﬁbrosis.Finally, current software for non-invasivemyocardial work assessment does not take myocardial wallthickness and curvature into account.TaggedEnd TaggedH15.Conclusion TaggedEnd TaggedPBased on myocardial work assessments, our study brings additional evidence of pathological LV remodeling instrength-trained athletes reporting regular use of AAS.
Impor- tantly, regional analysis of myocardial work highlighted that depressed myocardial function was observed at the basal-septal level in AAS-Athletes, whereas it was observed mainlyat the septal and apical levels in HCM-Athletes. These resultsunderlined the beneﬁt of myocardial work analysis comparedto myocardial strain analysis alone.In complement to otherinvestigations (e.g., genetic evaluation), these new parameterscould be useful for the clinician to better distinguish the major LV hypertrophy induced by regular use of supraphysiologic doses of AAS from LV hypertrophy due to HCM.TaggedEnd TaggedH1Acknowledgments TaggedEnd TaggedPThis work was supported by YAKHA Sport, France and by the Platform 3A, funded by the European RegionalDevelopment Fund, the French Ministry of Research, Higher Education and Innovation, the Provence-Alpes-C ^ote-d’Azur region, the Departmental Council of Vaucluse, and the UrbanCommunity of Avignon.
