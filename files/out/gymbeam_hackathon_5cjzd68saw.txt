Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo (PLA)-controlled study was conducted in healthy subjects with ArJD who had no history of osteoarthritis, or joint diseases. Ninety-six ( n=96, 20–55 years old) subjects who reported joint discomfort while performing a standardized single-leg-step-down testwere randomized to receive either PLA ( n=48) or 40 mg of undenatured collagen ( n=48) supplemen- tation daily for 24 weeks.Range of motion (ROM) ﬂexion and extension were measured using a digital goniometer.Results: At the end of the study, a statistically signiﬁcant increase in knee ROM ﬂexion was observed in the undenatured collagen group versus the PLA group (3.23 /C176vs.0.21 /C176;p=0.025).In addition, an increase in knee ROM extension by 2.21 /C176was observed over time in the undenatured collagen group ( p=0.0061), while the PLA group showed a nonsigniﬁcant increase by 1.27 /C176(p>0.05).
Subgroup analysis by age showed a signiﬁcant increase in knee ROM ﬂexion in subjects >35 years old in the undenatured collagen supplemented group com- pared with PLA (6.79 /C176vs. 0.30 /C176;p=0.0092).Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest that daily supplementation of 40 mg of undenatured collagen improved knee joint ROM ﬂexibility and extensibility in healthy subjects with ArJD.Keywords: undenatured collagen, joint ﬂexibility, range of motion, knee joint function 1Nutritional CRO, BioTeSys GmbH, Esslingen, Germany.2Institute of Sports Science and Kinesiology, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.3Research and Development, Lonza Greenwood, North Emerald Road, Greenwood, SC, USA.ªChristiane Scho ¨n et al.2022; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Furthermore, OA is the most prevalent joint disease in the United States and its prevalence has ap- proximately doubled since the mid-20th century.2According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in 2020, an estimated32.2 million Americans were living with OA.1,3As common treatment of OA symptoms, prescription of oral nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is widely used. In a recentindividual patient data meta-analysis, Persson et al.showed that topical NSAIDs are effective for OA pain relief.4 Daily life activity is characterized by differing intensities of physical activity that exert variable weight-bearing load on the joints.
Joint stress caused by mechanical overload, anatomical weaknesses (e.g., unequal leg length and knockknees) or joint instability leads to localized pain and stiffness that limit joint ﬂexibility and mobility in healthy subjects without diagnosed OA.5Studies have shown that even a few degrees of loss of knee range of motion (ROM) ﬂexibility canresult in altered gait patterns leading to difﬁculty in running and jumping.6,7Knee ROM is essential for daily function for athletes as well as for normal active people.8Interventions aimed at improving ROM have been shown to alleviate joint stiffness, increase joint mobility, and maintain joint function. A recent investigation of Wallace et al.
on long-term trends in knee OA prevalence in the United States indicated that knee OA may be more preventable than is currently supposed.2Therefore, preventive actions, which include joint protection by physical activity, dietary intervention,or dietary supplements, appear to be an important factor in the progression of this disease. Undenatured collagen is one such dietary supplement that could be used in subjects withactivity-related joint discomfort (ArJD) to prevent possi- ble progression of the complaints such as limited mobility.Studies have shown that undenatured collagen supplemen-tation can improve joint mobility in OA subjects as well as in healthy subjects who experience ArJD.9,10 In a placebo-controlled study, Lugo et al.
reported im- provements in knee joint extension in healthy subjects sup- plemented with undenatured collagen and who experienced joint pain while performing the stepmill exercise.10More recently, our group validated the single-leg-step-down (SLSD)test as a reliable model to select for healthy subjects who experience ArJD, thereby allo wing assessment of knee joint function in this population.11In this study, Scho ¨ne ta l .d e m - onstrated that subjects with ArJD may show impairments of knee joint ﬂexibility assessed by goniometry in comparison with the healthy subjects without any joint complaints.Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the impact of undenatured collage n supplementation on joint ﬂexibility, as measured by knee ROM ﬂexion and extension inhealthy subjects who experience ArJD on the SLSD test.
Materials and Methods Study design The study was performed as a prospective, multicentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in par-allel design. This study was conducted following the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice set forth by the International Council for Harmonization of TechnicalRequirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH E6[R2], Nov.2016) and following the Declaration of Helsinki (E8) for treatment of human subjects in a study.This study was approved by the local ethics committee (InstitutionalReview Board of the Landesa ¨rztekammer Baden- Wu¨rttemberg, ﬁle number F-2019-072) and the clinical trial was registered at DRKS—German Clinical Trials RegisterDRKS: DRKS00018792.Subjects were screened for their eligibility after providing written informed consent.All subjects completed a medicalhistory questionnaire at screening.Subjects were assessed foranthropometric measures and vital signs.
Healthy males and females, 20–55 years old with a body mass index between 19 and 29.9 kg/m 2, were eligible to participate in the study. All subjects had to perform sports at least two times per week, including but not limited to activities such as soccer, basketball, handball, volleyball, tennis, and running.In addi-tion, subjects had to report reversible knee-joint discomfort during or immediately after physical activity over a period of at least 3 months.The SLSD test was further used toselect subjects at the screening visit.11,12Only subjects who experienced a pain level of ﬁve on an 11-point Likert scale while performing between 30 and 150 steps during theSLSD test were eligible to participate.
Exclusion criteria included joint replacement of the knee, planned surgical intervention during the study du- ration, intra-articular therapy within the 3 months beforethe study initiation, and a history or presence of any medical disorders that could potentially interfere with the study, such as active cancer, cardiovascular disease (e.g.,stroke and heart attack), or pregnancy and lactation. In addition, subjects with hip, spine, or foot injuries were excluded.Further exclusion criteria were smoking of morethan ﬁve cigarettes per day, known hypersensitivity toeggs, chicken, or any ingredients in the products, and chronic use of pain relief medication within 30 days before the screening visits.To reduce the effect of confounding factors, study sub- jects were asked to maintain their usual diet during the study duration.The use of dietary supplements that could inﬂu-ence joint pain, discomfort, and recovery was not allowed throughout the study.
Forty-eight hours before the test days, subjects were not allowed to perform any sporting activities,such as cycling, running, or other exhaustive physical ac- tivities, such as heavy gardening or hiking. Thirty-six hours before screening and at all study visits, subjects were askednot to take any oral pain medication (e.g., aspirin and para-cetamol) to avoid any possible impact of anti-inﬂammatory ingredients on joint discomfort or joint ﬂexion.Subjects had to document any intake of pain medication in a diary.Inaddition, at each study visit, the recent intake of pain relievers was assessed.Among the 178 males and females screened, 96 subjects were randomized, and 82 subjects were identiﬁed as screen failures according to the inclusion or/and exclusion criteria (Fig.1).The most common reasons for screen failure weretoo early occurrence of pain level 5 during the SLSD test (<30 repetitions) or too low pain level during the SLSD test performance ( <5).
There were no dropouts during the courseUNDENATURED TYPE II COLLAGEN IMPROVES KNEE RANGE OF MOTION 541 of the study. The study was conducted at BioTeSys GmbH and at the Institute of Sport and Movement Science of theUniversity of Stuttgart from September 2019 to January 2021.The study duration was 24 weeks (6 months) with a total of seven study visits in 4-week intervals that includedscreening, baseline (visit one), 4 weeks (visit two), 8 weeks (visit three), 12 weeks (visit four), 16 weeks (visit ﬁve), 20 weeks (visit six), and 24 weeks (visit seven).Knee ROM ﬂexion was performed at each study visit using a digital goniometer.Knee ROM extension was perfor- med at baseline, and at week 12 and 24.The assessment ofstudy parameters was done on the leg that typically experi-enced more intense pain after physical activity (target knee).
Sample size and randomization Sample size calculations were based on the results of a pre- viously performed pilot study11a n das t u d yb yL u g oe ta l .10 Assuming an effect size of 0.636, a sample size of 40 subjects per group would provide *80% power using a signiﬁcance level of 5%. Considering a dropout rate of 15%, the study was performedwith 48 subjects per group.When subjects fulﬁlled all the in- clusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, effectively establishing study eligibility, they were allocated randomly toone of the two study groups according to the randomizationlist, using consecutive counting following the schedule of their inclusion visit.The randomization was stratiﬁed by gender (male and female) in blocks of n=4.The randomization was per- formed with RandList (Datinf GmbH, Tu ¨bingen, Germany).
Investigational products Undenatured collagen from chicken sternum (40 mg UC-II/C210undenatured type II collagen per day, providing ‡3% undenatured type II collagen) and PLA (containingonly excipient, microcrystalline cellulose) in sensory iden- tical capsules were supplied by Lonza Greenwood LLC.(Greenwood, SC, USA). Subjects were instructed to con- sume products as one capsule daily with water in the evening before bedtime.Subjects were asked to documenttheir intake time in a diary.All investigational products were carefully stored at room temperature and in dry condi- tions until distributed to subjects.At visits one through six,new bottles were handed out with enough study products to last until their next visit.Compliance was calculated based on the dispensed and returned study products.
SLSD test The SLSD test is a unilaterally performed test, which was validated in a previous study.11During the test, subjects had to step forward and down from a platform with adjustable height.The down limb brushed the ﬂoor with the heel and then re- turned back up to the platform to full knee extension. The frequency of repetitions was given by a metronome.Subjectswere instructed to indicate the pain level of ﬁve on NRS-11, where 0 meant ‘‘no pain’’ and a pain of 10 meant ‘‘worst pain possible.’’ After that, the test was stopped.The number of totalrepetitions was documented.If no joint pain occurred afterlatest of at least 10 min, the stress test was stopped.Knee ROM The knee ROM of a joint is typically measured by the num- ber of degrees from the starting position of a segment to its position at the end of its full range of movement.In this study, a digital goniometer (Halo Medical Devices, Sydney, Aus-tralia) was used to measure knee ROM ﬂexion and extension.
For knee ROM ﬂexion measurement, the axis of a goni- ometer was placed at the intersection of the thigh and shankat the knee joint. Subjects lay in a prone position with shanks FIG.1.CONSORT ﬂow diagram.542 SCHO ¨N ET AL.(lower legs) hanging free over the edge of the examination table (position 1).Position 2 was the maximal ﬂexion of the knee joint (Supplementary Fig.S1).During the measurementof active ROM ﬂexion, the position 2 was reached actively bythe subject.While for passive ROM ﬂexion, the position 2 was reached using slight pressure by the investigator.Knee ROM extension was measured at baseline, and at week 12and 24.The subject sat on an examination table with shanks (lower leg) hanging vertical to the ﬂoor (position 1), and the ROM from this position to the maximal extension (position 2)was measured (Supplementary Fig.S1).
Safety Hematology, liver enzymes, lipid proﬁle, hsCRP, HbA1c, and kidney function parameters were assessed at screening as well as at the ﬁnal visit at Synlab Medizinisches Ver-sorgungszentrum Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Germany. Blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated at screening, and at week 12 and 24 after 5 min of rest in a sitting position.Adverse events (AEs) were documented during the study duration.Subjective rating of tolerability was assessed at week 24 using a questionnaire rating as ‘‘well-tolerated,’’‘‘slightly unpleasant,’’ and ‘‘very unpleasant.’’ The focusof the tolerability assessment was on any gastrointestinal events possibly linked to the intake of the study product as well as the intake regimen and size of capsule.Statistical methods The analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat popu- lation.Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baselinevalue as a covariate was used to analyze the statistical dif- ferences between the groups.
Changes over time within the study group were evaluated using analysis of variance(ANOVA) repeated measurements or Friedman test as appro-priate. Post hoc analysis for comparison between baseline and each study visit was performed applying Dunnett’s mul- tiple comparison test or Dunn’s multiple comparison testas appropriate.A signiﬁcance level of p<0.05 was used.The analysis was performed with IBM SPSS statistics 24 statistical software (Armonk, NY).Results Demographics and baseline characteristics Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the study participants.Ninety-six subjects met the eligibility criteria and were randomized to the PLA ( n=48) or to the undenatured collagen ( n=48) group.No signiﬁcant differences were ob- served for baseline characteristics in both the groups ( p>0.05).Product compliance Overall, intake compliance of study products was more than 99% for both the groups ( p>0.05).
Range of motion Regarding the parameter ROM ﬂexion active, no signif- icant differences between the study groups were observed at baseline ( p>0.05).
At the end of the study, the undenatured collagen supplemented group showed a statistically signiﬁ-cant mean increase of 3.23 /C176in the ROM ﬂexion compared Table 1.Baseline Characteristics and Safety Parameters Details Undenatured collagen ( n=48) PLA ( n=48) Age, year 34.5 –1.5 37.8 –1.6 BMI, kg/m223.91 –0.43 24.29 –0.38 Gender, M/F 20/28 20/28 Frequency of regular sporting activity 1·/week 0% 0% 2·/week 31% 21% 3·/week 35% 44% >3·/week 33% 35% Frequency of intensity of physical activity Low — 2% Moderate 21% 21%High 79% 77% Safety parameters Parameter Undenatured collagen Baseline ( n=48)Undenatured collagen End of intervention ( n=48)PLA Baseline (n=48)PLA End of intervention ( n=48) SBP, mm Hg 126.5 –13.6 125.4 –13.9 124.8 –12.1 120.5 –11.5 DBP, mm Hg 77.1 –7.8 78.3 –9.2 77.7 –9 76.5 –9.5 Cholesterol, mg/dL Men 175.5 –24 191.9 –23.35 176.5 –37.1 186.9 –36.08 Women 178.6 –34.5 184.6 –32.78 186.5 –35.2 187.5 –28.37 hsCRP, mg/dL Men 0.9 –0.7 0.7 –0.9 1.1 –0.8 1.2 –2.0 Women 1.7 –1.9 2.0 –2.5 1.1 –1.3 1.1 –1.3 BMI, body mass index; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; PLA, placebo; SBP, systolic blood pressure.UNDENATURED TYPE II COLLAGEN IMPROVES KNEE RANGE OF MOTION 543 with the mean increase of 0.21 in PLA /C176group (undenatured collagen, n=48: 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.44– 6.02 vs.
PLA, n=48: 95% CI: -1.67 to 2.08; p=0.0250). The signiﬁcant difference between the undenatured collagengroup and the PLA group in the ROM ﬂexion active was observed as early as week 8 of supplementation and con- tinued to improve signiﬁcantly during the course of thestudy (Fig.2a).The delta changes from baseline to 24 weeks between the groups are additionally summarized in Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S2.ROM ﬂexion active according to subgroup gender Subgroup analysis was performed for knee ROM ﬂexion active based on gender.In the subgroup of females, a sta- tistically signiﬁcant increase of 4.79 /C176was observed in the undenatured collagen group versus a slight decrease of-0.32/C176seen in the PLA group (undenatured collagen, n=28: 95% CI: 1.21–8.36 vs.PLA, n=28: 95% CI: -2.85 to 2.21; p=0.0063) after 24 weeks of supplementation (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig.S3).
The undenatured collagen groupshowed a signiﬁcant increase in ability to ﬂex the knee over baseline ( p<0.01) and over time ( p=0.0332) among the female subjects, and no such change was observed in thePLA group ( p>0.05). In the subgroup of men, there was a slight nonsigniﬁcant increase seen in the ROM ﬂexion for both the groups at theend of the study (undenatured collagen, n=20:+1.05 vs.PLA, n=20:+0.95; p>0.05).The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 2.ROM ﬂexion active according to subgroup age Subgroup analysis was performed for knee ROM ﬂexion active based on age.In the subgroup of age >35 years, sub- jects in the undenatured collagen group showed a signiﬁcant increase in ROM ﬂexion than in the PLA group (unde- natured collagen, n=19:+6.79/C176, 95% CI: 2.38–11.20 vs.PLA, n=27:+0.30/C176, 95% CI: -2.60 to 3.19; p=0.0092).
In addition, the undenatured collagen group showed a signiﬁ- cant increase in the ability to ﬂex the knee within the groupover time ( p=0.0024) and over baseline ( p<0.01) in sub- jects >35 years old, while no such change was observed in the PLA group ( p>0.05, Table 2).The results of the group of age >35 years are further sum- marized in Supplementary Figure S4. In the 20–35-year-old subgroup, there was a slight nonsigniﬁcant increase in theROM at the end of the study in both the groups (undenaturedcollagen, n=29: 95% CI: -2.64 to 4.44 vs.PLA, n=21: 95% CI: -2.32 to 2.51; p>0.05) (Table 2).Knee ﬂexion ROM passive No signiﬁcant difference between the study groups was observed at baseline ( p>0.05, Table 2).A nonsigniﬁcant increase was observed in the undenatured collagen group,while no changes were seen in the PLA group after 24 weeks of intervention (undenatured collagen, n=48:+2.15/C176, 95% CI:-0.71 to 5.00 vs.PLA, n=48:+0.06/C176, 95% CI: -2.85 to 2.97; p>0.05).
ROM extension ROM extension was evaluated at visits one (baseline), four (12 weeks), and seven (24 weeks). Baseline values were comparable between both the study groups ( p>0.05).After 24 weeks of supplementation, a slight increase in ROMextension of 2.21 /C176was observed in the undenatured collagen group and a slight increase of 1.27 /C176in the PLA group.Analysis of changes over baseline ( p<0.01) and over time (p=0.0061) in knee ROM extension showed a signiﬁcant increase in the undenatured collagen group.No such change was observed in the PLA group ( p>0.05, Fig.2b, Table 2).Safety assessments No abnormalities were reported for any of the blood bio- chemistry, hematology, or vital signs (Table 1).Similarly,no study product-related AEs were noted in either the unde- natured collagen or the PLA group.The tolerability of undenatured collagen was rated as ‘‘well tolerated’’ by 98%of the study participants.
Based on this, it is concluded thatsupplementation of undenatured collagen was well-tolerated over the 24-week study period. Discussion Joint ﬂexibility is of utmost importance in the daily lives of athletes as well as in active people.It has been reported FIG.2.Distribution of ROM results for (a)ROM ﬂexion active ( /C176);(b)ROM extension active ( /C176) in the undenatured collagen group versus PLA group over the study; linegraph with mean –95% CI; * p<0.05, signiﬁcant difference of delta changes between the interventions.{{p<0.01; signiﬁcant difference over time in undenatured collagen.CI, conﬁdence interval; ROM, range of motion; PLA, placebo.544 SCHO ¨N ET AL.

545 that the stress on knee joints during physical activity may result in immunologic responses that mirror those seen in arthritic diseases, which can ultimately lead to a decreasein knee joint ﬂexibility.13Similarly, aging has been shown to reduce knee ROM due to wear and tear exerted on the joints from daily use.14–19According to the CDC, an aver- age adult loses 1 /C176of knee ﬂexion and extension ROM for every 10 years of age.18This loss in ﬂexibility with age has been attributable, in part, to decreased activity20and decrea- sed joint mobility.18Therefore, restoring and maintaining knee ROM are critical to keeping joints healthy. Knee ROM is commonly used as an outcome measure in clinical studies of people with knee OA, rheumatoid ar-thritis (RA), and in athletes.21,22Steultjens et al.demon- strated that the mean knee ROM in an OA group was 19% lower than in control group.21In another study, McCarthy et al.
reported that patients with knee OA had signiﬁcantlylower knee ﬂexion ROM than matched controls.23Other studies have reported that patients with knee OA demon- strate reduced knee motion during walking compared withhealthy controls alongside a reduction in gait velocity.24–26 In another study, strong correlations were found between theloss of ROM of the knee and hip joints, and disability in anelderly population. 27–29 In the current study, a signiﬁcant improvement in knee ﬂexion was observed with undenatured collagen supplemen-tation.An increase in knee ﬂexion was seen as early as 8weeks of supplementation and it continued to improve even- tually reaching 3.23 /C176at the end of the study.In a recently published pilot study, the authors reported that healthy sub-jects with ArJD have impaired ROM.
11The improvement by 3/C176in the current study suggests that undenatured colla- gen supplementation may beneﬁt to improve knee ﬂexion inhealthy subjects who are at risk of developing joint ailments down the road. Subgroup analysis based on gender showed that females reported higher ROM ﬂexion improvement in response toundenatured collagen supplementation than was seen in males.This gender-based difference in efﬁcacy could be possibly attributed to the fact that females with joint dis-order exhibit lower ROM, 21through which supplementation with undenatured collagen might allow for a greater chance to see better outcomes in such a population.A separate subanalysis based on age demonstrated that subjects aged 35 years and older experienced a higher increase in active ROM ﬂexion in response to undenaturedcollagen supplementation than was observed with subjects between 20 and 35 years of age.
One possible explanation for these preferential results might be due to the fact thatolder subjects are expected to have lower ROM to start withcompared with younger subjects, and hence, one would expect that older adults could beneﬁt to a higher extent from undenatured collagen supplementation. A signiﬁcant increase in knee extension was seen in the undenatured collagen group after 24 weeks of supplemen- tation.This is in agreement with the previous researchwhere supplementation of undenatured collagen for 120 days was shown to improve knee extension ROM in healthy subjects who experienced joint pain upon strenuous exer-cise.10These same subjects were also able to exercise longer before experiencing joint pain post-120 days of supplemen- tation.10In the present study, an increase in knee extension,in addition to ﬂexion, suggests that undenatured collagen supplementation could improve joint function and mobility to better support everyday activities.
With respect to passive knee ﬂexion, no signiﬁcant changes were observed between the study groups. This is not sur- prising as subjects in this study were healthy and hence did not have any overt restriction in their joint mobility/movement.In addition to this, considering that passive knee ﬂexion is reached with help from the investigator, many of the study participants were able to reach passive kneeﬂexion to the maximum extent at the beginning of the study.This could possibly explain the lack of signiﬁcant change in passive knee ﬂexion between the study groups.Although it has been also shown in previous studies that OA subjects as well as subjects with activity-related joint discomfort may beneﬁt from a supplementation with un- denaturated type II collagen by enhancing joint mobility, 9,10 the exact mechanism of action is still not fully understood.
According to animal and in vitro studies, it is assumed that during exercise, some processes that also occur in OA areactivated, such as distribution of proinﬂammatory cyto- kines.13,30,31Undenatured type II collagen appears to reduce joint inﬂammation by acting via the gut-associated lym-phoid tissue. It seems to stimulate immune cells (T cells) to produce anti-inﬂammatory cytokines in joints.31This mech- anism helps to diminish inﬂammatory processes and to stim-ulate cartilage repair, which seems to be a possible mode ofaction of the study product.The current study has limitations that the reader should consider when reviewing the results.No biomarker assess-ment was performed in the current study to investigate the mode of action of undenatured type II collagen on joint health.This should be investigated in further studies.Furthermore, during the study, there was a global out- break of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Forthe major period of 2020, gymnasiums, ﬁtness centers,stores, and other public places were all closed as part of a global lockdown aiming to halt the spread of the virus. Some subjects, especially those who regularly performed weighttraining and team sports—such as soccer and handball— could not participate in their usual physical activities or training.However, study investigators advised the subjects to con- tinue with their usual physical activity routines and perform alternative sport types at home or outdoors where possible tomaintain consistency.Most subjects followed these recom- mendations; however, during the winter months in colder climates, outdoor physical activities were often not possible.Therefore, some subjects reported a reduction in the fre-quency of regular physical activity.As these changes were only transient, these deviations were rated as minor.Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,some rescheduling of study visits had to be made.
Never- theless, the intake period was not interrupted as subjects were supplied with additional products. Overall, the ﬁndings from this study underline the impor- tance of maintaining healthy ROM, especially in subjects who already show signs of impairment.This study showedpromising results for undenatured collagen supplementation as a dietary ingredient with the ability to help improve knee joint ROM ﬂexion and extension.546 SCHO ¨N ET AL.Conclusions In the current study, the effect of undenatured collagen supplementation on knee joint ﬂexibility in subjects with ArJD was investigated.The data support that undenatured collagen UC-II is a food ingredient with the potential topositively affect function of knee joint resulting in an impro- vement of knee ﬂexion assessed by goniometry, demon- strating the beneﬁt in a population at risk.
As the biomarkerassessment was not performed in the current study, thisshould be emphasized in future research to investigate the mode of action of undenatured type II collagen on joint health.
