Current Therapeutic Research 99 (2023) 100719 Introduction Motion sickness (kinetosis) is a common collaterality of an af- ferens mismatch among visual, head/eyes position perception, and body proprioception that commonly occurs in people under slow frequency movements such as during boat travels, elevator dislo- cation, and car rides. Although it is a benign and spontaneously reversible manifestation in most cases, it is stressful and debili- tating for people with chronic complaints consistent with motion sickness as well as for occasionally compromised individuals.Some hypotheses have been forwarded on why visual, head/eyes position perception, and body proprioception incoordination should even manifest itself with nausea and vomiting reﬂex triggering.Guedry et al 1 propose that this autonomic activation would be expected to drive the motion-sick person away from the phenomenon causing this incoordination in the ﬁrst place.
Whatever the underlying link- age, several nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic resources have been developed and implemented to prevent or reverse motion sickness. The objective of this study was to evaluate the eﬃcacy and safety of a combination of gamma-aminobutyric acid, glu- tamic acid, dibasic calcium phosphate, thiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin vs ginger extract in the management of chronic complaints consistent with motion sickness, under a self-paired and comparative (randomized and double-blind) design.To maintain body posture and integration between eye and head movements, the central nervous system counts on a so-called velocity storage mechanism, a compensatory system located in the vestibular nuclei of the brain stem that stores activity related to slow-phase eye velocity.
The velocity storage mechanism is inﬂu- enced by vestibular-only neurons (a group of cells that receive af- ferens from the head, body, and limbs, underpinning the sense of body rotation) that are under the control of the nodulus of the vestibulo-cerebellum. The former sets the time constant of angular vestibulo-ocular reﬂex ( T VOR ), a time constant involved in control of eye movements stabilization against rapid angular head move- ments through angular vestibulo-ocular reﬂex interaction between visual and vestibular systems and semicircular canals for postural compensation, and interaction between the 3 semicircular canals and the otolith organs (saccule and utricle) of the vestibular ap- paratus, for the same purpose.
It is known that T VOR is directly correlated to motion sickness susceptibility due to asynchronicity among the neurophysiologic elements under its inﬂuence (as de- tailed above), triggered whenever the former is prolonged; one can presume that correcting T VOR could conversely decrease this sus- ceptibility. 2 Gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABA b ) receptors are located on vestibular-only neurons and their stimulation is associated with low-frequency angular vestibulo-ocular reﬂex modulation, as well as reduction of both T VOR and velocity storage time.Vestibular- only neurons in their turn can stimulate the velocity storage mechanism, triggering motion sickness, which is experimentally amenable to the inhibitory effects of baclofen, a GABA b receptor agonist.3 , 4 Agonist stimulation of GABA b could therefore mean that motion sickness is responsive to pharmacologic control through in- hibition of vestibular-only neurons.
5 GABA b synapses on vestibular- plus-saccade neurons are likely to be involved in GABAergic- mediated reduction in motion sickness as well. 2 , 6 Vagal nerve impulses transmitted from the gastric lining up to the vomiting center through 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) (sero- tonin) afferent neurotransmission, are associated with nausea and vomiting due to gastric disorders in general.Gastric dysrhythmia in their turn, triggered by the presence of food in the stomach in the setting of motion sickness, has been implicated as a secondary mechanism in the pathogenesis of kinetosis nausea.7 , 8 Motion sickness is deﬁned as a set of autonomic symptoms sec- ondary to conﬂicts between expected vs actual sensory impres- sions under conditions of motion.Its pathophysiology is based on mismatched inputs among intravestibular structures (semicircular and otolith organs), visual input, kinesthesic proprioceptive sys- tem, and velocity storage mechanism.
1 , 2 There are 3 types of kine- togenic mismatches, a classiﬁcation based on conﬂicts among in- puts from visual, vestibular, semicircular, and otholit organs: type 1 (conﬂicting motion-related input from 2 sensory systems), type 2 (when ﬁrst input signals motion, but the second does not), and type 3 (the opposite). 1 Motion sickness corresponds to a complex of symptoms rang- ing from sopite syndrome (early symptoms of incipient motion sickness with apathy and reduced alertness) to severe vomiting, triggered by car travel, sea movement, or plane trips.1 , 9 Children, women, and genetically proﬁled individuals are more susceptible to it.9 The pathophysiological basis for vomiting during motion sickness is based on neuroanatomic relations among the various structures involved in motion and visceral control in the brain stem.
Autonomic reactions like salivation, cold sweating, and vom- iting can be triggered via connections between the so-called vom- iting center (nucleus tractus solitarius and medullary reticular for- mation) and either the hypothalamus or the vestibular nuclei. 2 Motion sickness management is based on the following ap- proaches: 1 •Behavioral countermeasures •Habituation (the most effective intervention, but re- quires a long-term commitment).•Short-term behavioral modiﬁcations: changes in body posture (aligning the head with the body, reducing head movements), changes in visual attention (syn- chronizing the visual system with the motion—focus on the horizon), and reducing intersensory conﬂict (avoid low-frequency motions and movements outside the axes of motion).•Pharmacological countermeasures •Anticholinergics (scopolamine).•Antihistamines (dimenhydrinate and cinnarizine).•Sympathomimetics (amphetamine).•Antagonists of gastric 5-HT3 receptors (ginger extract).
•Vestibular nuclei physiology modulators (GABA, gluta- mate) (proposed in this article). Materials and Methods This was a double-blind, comparative, and self-paired, random- ized study for eﬃcacy and safety evaluation of 1 plant derivative (160 mg dry rhizome extract of Zingiber oﬃcinale Roscoe [ginger] corresponding to 8 mg gingerols as coated tablets) vs a combina- tion of GABA tartrate 100 mg, glutamic acid 100 mg, dibasic cal- cium phosphate 50 mg, thiamine nitrate 25 mg, pyridoxine chlo- ride 10 mg, and cyanocobalamin 5 μg as coated tablets.The pri- mary eﬃcacy end point was percentage of patients presenting a reduction of ≥20 score points in the total motion sickness as- sessment questionnaire (MSAQ) score (see further).
Secondary eﬃ- cacy end points were percentage of patients presenting a reduction of the total MSAQ score, absolute MSAQ score reduction, physi- cian’s assessment scores, ﬁnal overall eﬃcacy assessment of the study medication, and willingness to continue treatment. Safety end points were overall assessment of tolerability and number of patients presenting adverse events.The study design is depicted in Figure 1 .The study population consisted of outpatients of both sexes in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from August 2021 to Septem- ber 2022.The study was performed at Centro Universitário Serra dos Órgãos Medical School.The study protocol and related docu- ments received approval from the ethical committee (approval No.2 C.P.Nunes, C.Rodrigues, M.Suchmacher et al.Current Therapeutic Research 99 (2023) 100719 Figure 1.Diagram representing study design of gamma-aminobutyric acid tartrate and combinations (Group A) vs ginger extract (Group B).4.913.663) before the study startup.
The protocol adhered to the World Medical Association’s Code of Ethics, speciﬁcally the Decla- ration of Helsinki, for experiments involving humans and is reg- istered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identiﬁer NCT05221892). Patients vol- untarily participated in the study.No compensation was given or charges rendered.All patients provided written informed consent before any study-related activity.Patients were selected according to the following inclusion cri- teria: individuals of both sexes with ages ranging from 18 and 65 years (reproductive-age women had to practice contraception dur- ing the study period), a clinical picture consistent with kinetosis, and signed informed consent.Patients were not eligible if they presented with hypersensitivity to study medications, gallbladder stone history, gastritis history, arterial blood pressure > 145 ×100 mm Hg, and concomitant use of other kinetosis medications.
All enrolled patients were submitted to a clinical and laboratory screening before the study start. Motion sickness was assessed using the MSAQ, a 16-item ques- tionnaire for the evaluation of the gastrointestinal, central ner- vous system, peripheral, and sopite-related manifestations of mo- 3 C.P.Nunes, C.Rodrigues, M.Suchmacher et al.Current Therapeutic Research 99 (2023) 100719 tion sickness on a scale of 1 to 9.10 The lowest possible score per individual is 16 points (no motion sickness symptoms) and the highest possible score is 144 points (worst possible motion sick- ness symptoms).All enrolled patients answered the MSAQ form immediately af- ter a ≤15 minutes duration trip (total 4 trips), including type and duration of transportation.Both study medications were adminis- tered 15 minutes before Trips 2 to 4 (Trip 1 was exempted).
Visit 2 took place after the 4 study trips were completed (within 7 days of Visit 1), and included a scored physician assessment on a 10- point scale rated from 1 (worst evaluation) to 10 (best evalua- tion), evaluation of willingness to continue treatment on a 10-point scale rated from 1 (least willing) to 10 (most willing to continue treatment), concomitant medication assessment, and ﬁnal overall eﬃcacy assessment of study medication on a 4-item scale (very good, good, fair, or poor). Adverse event (AE) evaluation was con- ducted at Visit 2 (posttreatment) and included an overall assess- ment of tolerability by the patient, nature, duration, and grading of AE (mild, moderate, or severe), serious AE occurrence, treatment interruptions, and continuation of AE at the end of treatment.
Sample size determination was based on the primary end point, calculated to determine the percentage difference in a self-paired sample, and the estimated percentual difference was tested against 0.1 (null hypothesis). This number was based on a previous study of induced motion sickness treated with ginger, in which the max- imum percentage MSAQ score difference between treated and un- treated was 30%.The difference between the constant and the expected percentual difference was the minimum difference that would be important to detect.The SD of the difference was the function of the SDs before and after treatment and the correlation between them.Considering an average pre- to posttreatment dif- ference of 30% with a 2-tailed alpha of 0.050, an SE of 0.02, and a power of 1.0 (95% CI 0.25–0.35), the sample size of 360 was de- ﬁned.
Taking into account an estimated loss rate of 10% (dropouts, loss of follow-up, and patient withdrawal), the total sample re- quired for this study was 330 evaluable patients. All data were recorded in the clinical research form.Statistical analysis of collected data was performed using Power and Preci- sion statistical software version 4.1 (Biostat, Englewood, New Jer- sey).AEs were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Ac- tivities version 21.0 (in Portuguese).Clinical eﬃcacy and safety data were statistically analyzed by comparing the results of Visit 2 relative to Visit 1 and the evolving results of the trips in a self- paired and comparative fashion.Eﬃcacy data were analyzed for the per-protocol population (deﬁned as all patients who completed the study treatment regimen for each treatment trip) and safety data were analyzed for the intent-to-treat population (all partici- pants with at least 1 dose of study medication).
Results Population proﬁle A total of 335 patients were included in the study of whom 181 (54.0%) were women and with a mean (SD) age of 43 (11) years. Reported age ranges of motion sickness onset were child- hood, adolescence, and adulthood comprising 17, 84, and 234 pa- tients, respectively.One hundred sixty-one patients reported pre- vious treatments as herbal therapies, prescription drugs, over-the- counter, unspeciﬁed herbal teas, homeopathy, and combinations under a frequency of 35.2%, 24.4%, 11.1%, 2.0%, 11.8%, and 18.5%, re- spectively (4 patients reported previous use of ginger extract, and none reported GABA and associations).A number of patients were withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: AE (1 indi- vidual), lost to follow-up (3 individuals), concomitant medication (1 individual), protocol violation (2 individuals), and other reasons Table 1 Physical exam results at Visit 1 (pretreatment) and Visit 2 (end-of-study visit).

There was a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in the percentage of patients presenting a reduction of ≥20 score points in the to- tal MSAQ score in Group A at Trip 2 (54.1%; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.45–0.61), Trip 3 (62.3%; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.55–0.69), and Trip 4 (66.4%; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.59–0.73) relative to Trip 1. Similarly, there was a statistically signiﬁcant percentage reduction regarding the same end point in Group B at Trip 2 (43.6%; P < 0.05; 95% CI, 0.36–0.51), Trip 3 (50.9%; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.43–0.59), and Trip 4 (55.1%; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.47–0.63) relative to Trip 1.Conversely, there was a statistically signiﬁcant difference in favor of Group A regarding the mean of patients (106 and 82 patients for Groups A and B, respectively) presenting a reduction of ≥20 score points in the total MSAQ score ( P = 0.05; 95% CI for the mean difference, 21.7–26.2).
The percentage of patients who presented a reduction of the total MSAQ score of Trips 2 through 4 relative to Trip 1 is also depicted in Table 3 . There was a statistically signiﬁcant difference in the percentage of patients presenting a reduction in the total MSAQ score in Group A at Trip 2 (40.0%; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.33– 0.48), Trip 3 (45.2%; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.38–0.53), and Trip 4 (47.5%; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.40–0.54) relative to Trip 1.Similarly, there was a statistically signiﬁcant percentage reduc- tion regarding the same end point in Group B at Trip 2 (34.4%; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.27–0.42), Trip 3 (39.6%; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.32– 0.47), and Trip 4 (41.9%; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.35–0.50) relative to Trip 1.Conversely, there was a statistically signiﬁcant difference in favor of Group A regarding the mean of patients (164 and 157 pa- tients for Groups A and B, respectively) presenting a reduction in the total MSAQ score ( P = 0.05; 95% CI for the mean difference, 6.8–7.1).
Absolute MSAQ score reduction and score reduction per patient per Trip (both end points Trips 2 through 4) are depicted in Table 4 . There was a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in the mean ab- solute MSAQ score in favor of Group A (5339 [369] vs 5992 [374] points for Group B) ( P = 0.05 t test for 2 independent groups; 95% CI –573 to 732).Similarly, there was a statistically signiﬁcant re- duction in the mean (SD) score per patient per trip in favor of Group A (31.3 [2] vs 36.2 [2] points for Group B) ( P = 0.05 t test for 2 independent groups; 95% CI, 4.5 to 5.4) ( Figure 2 ).Physician assessment scores for Visits 1 and 2 are depicted in Table 5 .There was a statistically signiﬁcant increase in physician as- sessment scores at Visit 2 compared with Visit 1 for both Groups A (1299 points; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.64–0.77) and B (1124 points; P = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.40–0.56).Conversely, there was a statistically 4 C.P.Nunes, C.Rodrigues, M.Suchmacher et al.

(B) Comparative mean MSAQ score per patient per trip.above description, the rationale of GABA pharmacodynamics, and by extension that of glutamic acid in motion sickness control, can be based on the capacity of the former in stimulating GABA b receptors in vestibulo-cerebellum system.Pyridoxal-5 ′ -phosphate, the active form of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), is a metabolite involved in the following processes: activation of glutamic-decarboxylase for glutamic acid to GABA conversion, metabolism of speciﬁc amino acids (tryptophane, methionine, and cysteine), metabolism of brain amines (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine), and metabolism of fatty acids and phospholipids for neuronal cell membrane.
13 , 14 Calcium is a mineral neurotransmitter involved in neurotransmitters release modulation through voltage-dependent calcium channels, calmodulin release, and brain vascularity con- trol. 15 , 16 Thiamine pyrophosphate, the active form of thiamine (vi- tamin B1), is a coenzyme of the glycolytic pathway of neurons car- bohydrates metabolism and its rate of utilization is proportional to that of glucose.17 , 18 Cyanocobalamin plays a role in the enzy- matic reactions related to the myelin sheath (myelin basic pro- tein amino acids and fatty acids) and axonal tubulins (methio- nine metabolism) synthetic processes.Vitamin B12 deﬁciency, a known prevalent disorder, is related to myelinic brain cell edema and demyelination.19–21 It is plausible that the combination of the above neuropharmacological-acting substances could play a signif- icant role in motion sickness management as adjuvants to GABA and glutamic acid.
Zingiber oﬃcinale (ginger) is a Chinese herbal remedy tradition- ally used to alleviate nausea. Its rhizome is the source of an oleo- resin that contains phenolic gingerols, which are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and eliminated through phase II metabolism.Gingerols act as antagonists of gastric 5-HT3 recep- tors, therefore being potentially useful in the pharmacologic man- agement of nausea in the context of motion sickness.Ginger side effects are minimal.8 , 22 To the best of our knowledge and the available literature, this is the ﬁrst time the effectiveness and safety of this speciﬁc combina- tion of substances (Group A) in motion sickness management have been demonstrated.Both parameters have shown evidence for this combination under a self-paired study design, as well as consol- idated through comparison with another medication traditionally used for the same manifestation (ginger).
This clinical ﬁnding is supported by the pharmacologic action of GABA—and indirectly of its precursor glutamic acid—as GABA b ergic stimulators for motion sickness avoidance, as documented in the literature. Group A com- bination was generally safe, although it was predictably more fre- quently associated with neurological side effects, assuming the for- mer acts on the central nervous system.Conversely, ginger was less tolerated in the gastrointestinal tract because it acts on this level of the motion sickness pathophysiological axis.The studied population comprehended participants aged 18 to 65 years, which is a wide age range.Supposedly effectiveness and safety of both tested regimens could have been inﬂuenced by this populational aspect.Nonperformance of age subgroup analysis could therefore have represented a limitation of our study.
Conclusions Both the combination of GABA tartrate, glutamic acid, diba- sic calcium phosphate, thiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin (Group A) and the dry rhizome extract of Zingiber oﬃcinale (gin- ger) (Group B) were effective in the management of chronic com- plaints consistent with motion sickness, with a statistically supe- rior performance with the Group A combination. Both regimens were well tolerated, with a preponderance for the occurrence of neurological (mostly sleepiness) and gastrointestinal AEs (mostly bloating/ﬂatulence and burning tongue) for the Group A combina- tion and Group B drug, respectively.Declaration of Competing Interest This study was cosponsored by Gross Pharmaceuticals (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and Centro Universitário Serra dos Órgãos Medical School (Teresópolis, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil).The authors have indicated that they have no other conﬂicts of interest regarding the content of this article.CRediT authorship contribution statement Carlos P.
