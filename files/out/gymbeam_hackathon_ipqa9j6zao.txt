However, previous studies have not shown the clear bene ﬁts of LC ω-3 PUFAs for CVDs. REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH —representative randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined whether LC ω-3 PUFAs would prevent major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events (MACE) —showed con ﬂicting results with differences in the types, doses, or comparators of LC ω-3 PUFAs and study populations.Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis using major RCTs to address this inconsistency and assess theclinical and biological effects of LC ω-3 PUFAs.We included RCTs that involved /C21500 participants with /C211 y follow-up.Of 17 studies involving 143,410 people, LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation showed bene ﬁcial effects on CV death (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99; P¼0.029) and fatal or nonfatal MI (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.95; P¼0.010).RCTs on EPA alone showed better results for 3-point MACE, CV death, and fatal or nonfatal MI.
However, the bene ﬁts were not found for fatal or nonfatal stroke, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure. Of note, studies of both the EPA/DHA combination and EPA alone showed a signi ﬁcant increase in risk of new-onset atrial ﬁbril- lation.Thus, well-designed studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in the distinct effects of EPA compared with DHA on cardiometabolic diseases.This review discusses the potential bene ﬁts and safety of LC ω-3 PUFAs from a cardiometabolic perspective focusing on recent updates and controversies.

Several epidemiological and clinical studies have evaluated therelationship between EPA and DHA, 2 major compounds oflong-chain (LC) ω-3 PUFAs, and cardiometabolic diseases, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, MI,heart failure, and arrhythmia [ 2–4]. However, previous studies have not shown the clear bene ﬁts of LC ω-3 PUFAs for CVD.Recently, 2 large clinical trials, the Reduction of CardiovascularEvents with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT)[5] and the Long-Term Outcome Study to Assess Statin Residual Risk Reduction with EpaNova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients with Hypertrigl yceridemia (STRENGTH) [ 6], have also provided discrepant results.In REDUCE-IT, 4 g of icosapentethyl (IPE), a highly puri ﬁed form of EPA, produced cardio- vascular (CV) bene ﬁts in people receiving statin therapy [ 5].However, in STRENGTH, a high-dose combination of EPAa n dD H Ad i dn o ts h o ws u c hb e n e ﬁts in people with high CV risk [ 6].
The con ﬂicting results could be attributed to differ- ences in the types (EPA plus DHA or EPA alone), doses, orcomparators (corn oil, mineral oil, or other substances) of LC ω-3 PUFAs and distinct study populations. Therefore, we reviewed the bene ﬁts and safety of the 20 to 22–carbon LC ω-3 PUFAs, EPA, and DHA from a cardiometabolic perspective focusing on recent updates and controversies, including those regarding atrial ﬁbrillation.In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis using major randomized controlledtrials (RCTs) of LC ω-3 PUFAs based on strict eligibility criteria to assess potential clinical implications.The results were also usedto explain inconsistent evidence from RCTs and the clinical andbiological effects of LC ω-3 PUFAs.Finally, we suggest a practical consideration in LC ω-3 PUFA therapy for cardiometabolic diseases.Characteristics of ω-3 PUFAs Synthesis of ω-3 PUFAs that compete with ω-6 PUFAs FAs are classi ﬁed as saturated or unsaturated.
Saturated FAs have no double bonds, and each carbon forming the hydrocarbon chain has 2 hydrogen atoms and 2 adjacent carbon atoms. Un- saturated FAs have /C211 double bond and are subdivided into monounsaturated FAs with one carbon-carbon double bond andPUFAs with 2 or more double bonds.Even if the carbon-carbondouble bond is newly formed in the body, interconversion be-tween the PUFA series, such as ω-3,ω-6, and ω-9 PUFAs, does not occur because it is created between the existing double bond andthe carboxyl group [ 1].ω-6 PUFAs may affect the ef ﬁcacy of ω-3 PUFAs in humans.During the processing of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs, LA and ALA are converted into arachidonic acid and EPA by elongation and desaturation.Because both pathways use the same enzyme ( Δ6- desaturase), competition exists between the 2 PUFA series tooccupy the second position of phospholipids of the cells innearly all tissues in humans in terms of conversion and storage[7].
It has been reported that the higher the ratio of LA to ALA, t h em o r ei n h i b i t e dt h es y n t h e s i so fE P Aa n dD H Af r o mA L A[ 7].In addition, arachidonic acid and EPA compete for the same enzymes in the conversion to active eicosanoids, some of whichrespond differently to ω-3 and ω-6 [7,8]. The process that ex- acerbates conditions leading to pathophysiology is more intense in the ω-6 motif than in the ω-3 motif [ 7].For example, cyclooxygenase 1, an enzyme involved in PG formation, has a greater preference for ω-6 than ω-3 substrates and promotes PG 2 and thromboxane A production, inducing an in ﬂammatory response [ 7].Because these are essential FAs, both the con- centration of ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs and their relative amounts make a difference in competition for conversion and storage.ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs account for nearly 100% by weight of the composition of highly unsaturated FAs in blood or body tissues[9,10].
The range of ω-3 or ω- 6P U F A si s1 5 %t o8 5 %i nh u m a n s [9]. This relative amount plays an important role in inducing the competition between 2 FAs for conversion and storage [ 7].The metabolism and role of these PUFAs are well described in a recent article by Lands [ 7].In general, linoleic acid is suf ﬁcient in human diets but ALA is relatively lacking.Therefore, plasma and cell concentrations ofLC ω-6 PUFAs tend to be higher than those of LC ω-3 PUFAs [ 8].Based on limited studies, increasing the intake of ALA anddecreasing the intake of LA in the diet have been suggested toimprove LC ω-3 PUFA status [ 11].Moreover, it may be helpful to reduce LA intake to <2.5% of energy to increase DHA concen- trations [ 11].However, although the relationship between ω-6 andω-3 PUFAs might be important in human health, an agreed global standard suggesting an optimal ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 PUFAs for human health has not yet been determined [ 8].
Sources of LC ω-3 PUFAs ω-3 PUFAs are important structural components of the cell membrane phospholipid bilayers ( Figure 1 )[12,13]. Among PUFAs, essential FAs are indispensable for normal growth anddevelopment, cellular homeostasis, and various physiologicalfunctions.As essential FAs cannot be synthesized in the body, adecrease in the absolute amount results in a de ﬁciency.ALA, the most common ω-3 PUFA, can be converted into EPA (20:5n –3) and then into DHA (22:6n –3), but the conversion (primarily in the liver) rates are <15% [ 14,15].Therefore, consuming EPA and DHA directly from foods or dietary supple-ments is the only practical way to increase their concentrations in the body ( Figure 1 A).ALA can be found in vegetable oils, nuts, ﬂax seeds, ﬂaxseed oil, leafy vegetables, and some types of ani- mal fat, especially in grass-fed animals [ 16,17].
In this review, we differentiated between the 18-carbon ω-3 PUFA (ALA) and the 20- to 22-carbon LC ω-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) to clarify their biological effects. LCω-3 PUFAs are primarily synthesized by aquatic micro- algae and are present in ﬁsh,ﬁsh oils, and krill oils.When ﬁsh consume phytoplankton that have ingested microalgae, ω-3 PUFAs accumulate in their tissues [ 17].LC ω-3 PUFAs can also be consumed through nonmarine sources, such as beef, pork, and chicken, wherein these PUFAs are present as part of the membrane phospholipids [ 18].However, the content of these P U F A si na n i m a lm e a ti s~ 1 0 0t i m e sl e s st h a nt h a ti n ﬁsh [19].Although the consumption of ﬁsh, such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel, has been cautioned due to the concern of possiblyincreasing risk of heavy metal accumulation, there isJ.H.Bae et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 612 –628 613 compelling evidence that the many bene ﬁts ofﬁsh consumption outweigh any risk [ 20].
Meanwhile, as of now, the proportion of processed foods or meat in human diet has increased, and the ingestion of ﬁsh—the major source of ω-3 PUFAs —has decreased. Thus, it is recommended to take ﬁsh oil capsules (either as over-the-counter dietary supplements or phar maceutical-grade preparations) made from plant microalgaeor extracted with an appropriate method [ 14,16]t or e p l e n i s h the intake of ω-3 PUFAs while minimizing the potential complication described above.Biological effects of LC ω-3 PUFAs LCω-3 PUFAs are found in the cell membrane and rapidly esteri ﬁed and incorporated into lipoproteins and membrane phospholipids [ 12].Notably, EPA and DHA have different effects on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of atherosclerosis [ 13, 21].EPA preserves membrane structure and ﬂuidity and normal cholesterol distribution and inhibits membrane lipid oxidationand cholesterol crystal formation [ 13].
Moreover, EPA produces specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) [ 22] and in ﬂuences signal transduction pathways linked to in ﬂammation and vaso- dilation [ 13]. DHA also plays an essential role in the composition and function of the cell membrane, cell signaling, and theproduction of SPMs [ 22].DHA increases membrane ﬂuidity, promotes lipid domain change, and reduces antioxidative prop-erties [ 21].Because DHA is highly concentrated in the neuronal membranes (brain) and retina photoreceptors (eyes), it is involved in their development and function ( Figure 1 )[23].Despite the mechanistic evidence, it is uncertain whether thesedistinct actions of EPA and DHA have a signi ﬁcant impact on risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation has been reported to reduce CV mortality in large-scale clinical trials involving people with pre-existing CVD or at high CV risk [ 24].
Dietary intake of EPA and DHA was associated with a reduced risk of CAD mortality [ 2–4]. A pooled analysis of 17 prospective cohort studies has shown that circulating EPA and DHA concentrations are associated witha lower risk for CV mortality [ 4].In addition, LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation in the form of ﬁsh oil was associated with the prevention of CVD [ 2].In 2018, the AHA suggested consuming seafood 1 to 2 times a week, equivalent to 250 mg/d of EPA and DHA, to prevent CVD[3].Evidence from epidemiological studies and RCTs recom- mended the intake of 500 mg/d and 800 to 1000 mg/d of EPAplus DHA for people without or with CVD, respectively [ 25].The European Food Safety Authority indicated that daily ingestion of 250 to 500 mg EPA plus DHA reduced risk of CAD and sudden cardiac death [ 26].
Evidence of the Role of LC ω-3 PUFAs from a Cardiometabolic Perspective It has been reported that LC ω-3 PUFAs decrease circulating TG concentrations and have a positive impact on in ﬂammation and vascular endothelial cell function [ 25]. Intake of LC ω-3 PUFAs lowers plasma TG concentrations by reducing the syn-thesis of VLDL-1 in human liver [ 27].Consuming LC ω-3 PUFAs might also be associated with increased insulin sensitivity and decreased risk of type 2 diabetes [ 28,29].Administration of LC ω-3 PUFAs increases their proportions in the cell membrane, helping the synthesis of bioactive mediators that preservemitochondrial function, alleviate oxidative stress, and protectagainst CVD-related damage by maintaining ionic homeostasis[30].LC ω-3 PUFAs also reduce abnormal platelet activation and have a vascular protective effect by acting as a component of the FIGURE 1.Characteristics of ω-3 PUFAs.
(A) Chemical structures and dietary sources of ω-3 PUFAs and pathway for the biosynthetic conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA. Because of the low ef ﬁciency of converting ALA to EPA and DHA, it is recommended to consume EPA and DHA from additional dietary sources.Dietary sources of various ω-3 PUFAs are presented in the box on the left.(B) EPA and DHA in anatomical com- partments of the human body.ω-3 PUFAs are an important component of the membranes that surround each cell in our body.EPA and DHA are found in cell membranes esteri ﬁed into phospholipids and other complex lipids.These long-chain ω-3 PUFAs preserve membrane ﬂuidity and inhibit lipid oxidation and membrane cholesterol domain formation.Especially, DHA is highly concentrated in human brain and eyes.J.H.Bae et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 612 –628 614 blood vessel wall [ 31].
Atherosclerosis is a chronic in ﬂammatory condition involving various cell types, such as immune cells,vascular smooth muscle cells, and vascular endothelial cells[32]. LC ω-3 PUFAs may inhibit the development and progres- sion of atherosclerotic lesions by affecting the expression ofendothelial cell adhesion molecules, migration and in ﬁltration of monocytes/macrophages, interactions of monocytes/ macrophages with T cells, production of proin ﬂammatory cyto- kines, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells [ 33].In addition, LC ω-3 PUFAs are involved in the pathways related to atherosclerotic plaque stability and platelet thrombus formation[33].Therefore, LC ω-3 PUFAs have pleiotropic effects on vital organs and tissues, which might lead to CV and metabolic ben-eﬁts (Supplemental Figure 1 ).
SPMs Produced from EPA and DHA Over the past decade, SPMs, including protectins, resolvins, and maresins, have been in the limelight as potent autacoids endogenously produced from enzymatic oxygenation of LC ω-3 PUFAs [ 22,34]. A methodological study in humans demon- strated increased plasma concentrations of SPMs after intrave-nous supplementation with EPA and DHA [ 35].SPMs have proven to possess anti-in ﬂammatory effects in basic research [30].They have also emerged as potential regulators of physio- logic pathways in the resolution of in ﬂammation and unresolved inﬂammation [ 36].Resolvin D2 and maresin 1 treatment reduced TNF- α–stimulated p65 translocation, superoxide production, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 gene expression and inhibited aortic smooth muscle cell migration in cell-basedexperiments [ 37].Treatment with these SPMs reduced neo- intimal hyperplasia at 14 d in carotid artery-injured mice by 62%and 67%, respectively [ 37].
Another study using a balloon artery-injured rat model showed that resolvin D1 and protectinD1 decreased neointimal hyperplasia by 37.3% and 31.8%,respectively [ 38]. Additionally, they attenuated the in ﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells and mitigated NF- κB activity [ 38].The free acid and liposome forms of resolvin D1 alleviated acuteinﬂammation initiated by MI, thereby delaying the onset of heart failure [ 39].Brown adipose tissue-derived maresin 2 reduced obesity-induced in ﬂammation partly by promoting macrophages in the liver [ 40].Thus, SPMs are likely to have bene ﬁcial roles beyond LC ω-3 PUFA derivatives in intermediary metabolism and cell membrane dynamics in the CV system [ 30], possibly exerting antiatherosclerotic effects by attenuating proin-ﬂammatory stimulus [ 41].The main mechanisms of SPM actions are presented in Supplemental Figure 2 .
Multifaceted Effects of LC ω-3 PUFAs Potential mechanisms of how LC ω-3 PUFAs mitigate atherosclerosis and reduce CV risk are shown in Figure 2 . Effects on lipid metabolism In RCTs involving people with severe hypertriglyceridemia (/C21500 mg/dL), a gross weight of 4 g/d ω-3 PUFAs signi ﬁcantly reduced TG concentrations (median changes /C052% to /C031%) compared with placebo [ 42–45].The TG-lowering ef ﬁcacy might depend on baseline circulating TG concentrations[42–45].In these trials, a gross weight of 4 g ω-3 PUFAs also decreased non-HDL (median change /C018% to /C010%), VLDL FIGURE 2.Potential mechanisms of how long-chain ω-3 PUFAs mitigate atherosclerosis and reduce cardiovascular risk.J.H.Bae et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 612 –628 615 (median change /C041% to /C021%), and total cholesterol (median change /C016% to /C08%) compared with placebo [ 42–45].
The effects of ω-3 PUFAs on HDL cholesterol (median change /C04% to þ9%), LDL cholesterol (median change /C02% to þ49%) [ 42–45], and apoB (median change /C09% to þ2%) [ 44,45] were incon- sistent between the studies. Based on these ﬁndings, ω-3 ethylesters, ω-3 carboxylic acids, ω-3 ethyl esters A, and IPE are approved as dietary adjuncts to reduce circulating TG concen- trations in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia ( Table 1 ).In people with moderate hypertriglyceridemia (200 to <500 mg/dL), a gross weight of 4 g/d ω-3 PUFAs also signi ﬁcantly reduced circulating TG concentrations (median change /C023% toTABLE 1 Information and related studies of prescription ω-3 FAs Products EPA and DHA combination EPA alone Lovaza Epanova Omtryg Vascepa Epadel Company GlaxoSmithKline AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPTrygg Pharma, Inc.Amarin Pharma, Inc.

1Can be increased to 2.7 g/d if TG concentrations remain abnormal.J.H. Bae et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 612 –628 616 /C022%), whereas it increased LDL cholesterol compared with placebo [ 46–48].LCω-3 PUFA supplementation can lead to an increase in LDL cholesterol concentrations.However, TG lowering by LC ω-3 PUFAs may reduce the cholesteryl ester transfer protein-mediated transfer of TG from VLDL to LDL, thereby increasing the LDL particle size.It leads to an increase in less atherogenic large buoyant LDL particles rather than atherogenic small denseLDL particles [ 49].In addition, LC ω-3 PUFAs can reduce TRLs and their remnants.Emerging evidence suggests that an increasein TRLs and their remnants contributes to risk of ASCVD andpartly explains residual CV risk after statin therapy [ 50].Therefore, the bene ﬁcial effects of LC ω-3 PUFAs on lipid meta- bolism can contribute to a reduction in atherosclerotic risk.
Anti-in ﬂammation Several mechanisms whereby LC ω-3 PUFAs play a bene ﬁcial role in the in ﬂammatory process have been postulated. One study reported that puri ﬁed EPA produced EPA-rich HDL [51].This reconstituted form of HDL contained EPA- phosphatidylcholine, which had antiatherogenic properties anddecreased vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression [ 51].Moreover, the reconstituted HDL enhanced cholesterol ef ﬂux and produced resolvin E3 and 18-hydroxy-EPA, EPA-derivedanti-in ﬂammatory metabolites [ 51].The increased ﬂux of free FAs associated with metabolic impairments, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, causes endothelial dysfunction by enhancing NF- κB-related in ﬂammatory pathways [52].DHA reduced cytokine-induced expression of endothelial adhesion molecules and decreased secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 inendothelial cells [ 52].
In a randomized, crossover study, DHA treatment signi ﬁcantly reduced the concentrations of in ﬂam- matory markers, such as IL-18, compared with EPA treatment[53]. LC ω-3 PUFAs also exhibited anti-in ﬂammatory effects by binding to membrane phospholipids and reducing AA, known asa representative product of ω-6 PUFAs [ 54].Immunomodulation LCω-3 PUFAs modulate the immune response by converting them into SPMs [ 30].SPMs are produced by the oxidation of essential FAs, including EPA, DHA, and DPA.They are classi ﬁed as resolvin, protectin, and maresin.LC ω-3 PUFA administration can increase SPMs, which have protective effects on the CV andCNSs [ 30].In an animal model of MI, bioactive mediators con- verted from LC ω-3 PUFAs, such as resolvin E1 and resolvin D1, showed cardioprotective effects by reducing macrophage in ﬁl- tration and in ﬂammatory mediators [ 55].
Neuroprotectin D1 and resolvin D2 also enhanced cell survival signaling pathways,maintained blood-brain barrier integrity, and promoted angio-genesis during acute CV ischemia [ 56,57]. Antiplatelet activity LCω-3 PUFAs affect thrombotic mechanisms, including platelet activation and aggregation.On top of aspirin and clo-pidogrel treatment, EPA decreased platelet activation and adhesion, thromboxane A2 synthesis, and the concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [ 58].A previous human study reported that EPA supplementation decreased thromboxane A2 concentrations by 58%, leading toincreased formation of the inactive thromboxane A3 [ 59].LC ω-3PUFA supplementation also increased prostaglandin I3 and inactive thromboxane A3 concentrations, thereby improving theprostaglandin I/thromboxane A balance, which had car-dioprotective and antithrombotic effects [ 60].
Thus, LC ω-3 PUFAs might lead to CV bene ﬁts by reducing platelet function and hemostasis in conjunction with lowering TG concentrations, improving endothelial function, and alleviating in ﬂammation [61,62]. It should be noted that a highly puri ﬁed form of DHA might be more antithrombotic than EPA [ 63].In addition, men may bene ﬁt more from EPA whereas women are more responsive to DHA for platelet aggregation [ 64].This ﬁnding suggests that interactions between sex hormones and LC ω-3 PUFAs may reduce platelet aggregation differentially in healthy individuals[64].Effects on glucose homeostasis LCω-3 PUFAs could bene ﬁt people with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance via multiple mechanisms because the TG-lowering ef ﬁcacy is associated with improvements in glucose metabolism [ 65].In a meta-regression of 45 RCTs, ω-3 PUFA supplementation improved glucose regulation and reducedTNF- αand IL-6 concentrations as well as induced favorable changes in lipid pro ﬁles [66].
An RCT involving healthy older adults showed that intake of ω-3 PUFAs increased muscle mass and improved muscle function [ 67], which is known to be positively associated with glucose homeostasis. In a db/db mice study, 1-wk treatment with EPA without DHA alleviated insulinresistance, decreased fasting insulin and glucose concentrations,and improved glucose intolerance [ 68].Treatment with EPA alone also improved pancreatic β-cell function, reduced liver TGs with enhanced gene expression in hepatic FA oxidation, and altered microbiota composition [ 68].Although many studies have demonstrated various bene ﬁts of LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation, its long-term effects on the pre- vention or treatment of type 2 diabetes remain controversial.Observational studies have suggested both positive and negativeeffects of LC ω-3 PUFAs on glucose metabolism and risk of type 2 diabetes [ 69,70].
In a meta-analysis of 83 RCTs involving 121, 070 adults at any risk of type 2 diabetes, intake of ω-3,ω-6, and total PUFAs (mainly LC ω-3 PUFAs; mean dose: 2.0 g/d, mean duration: 33 mo) had little or no effect on incident type 2 dia- betes and glucose metabolism (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, and the HOMA-IR) [ 71]. Given the results and cardiometabolic bene ﬁts of LC ω-3 PUFAs, large-scale RCTs are needed to elucidate the effects on glucose metabolism.Impact on gut microbiota In a study with db/db mice, EPA and DHA supplementation reduced the abundance of the LPS-containing Enterobacteriaceae.At the same time, it instead increased that of bene ﬁcialBiﬁdo- bacterium ,Lactobacillus , and SCFA-producing species [ 72].
The gut microbiome alterations were accompanied by shifts in themetabolome, including glutamate, bile acids, propionic andbutyric acids, and LPS, which subsequently relieved pancreaticβ-cell apoptosis, suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis, and facil- itated the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 [ 72]. A study using data from 876 twins with 16S microbiome and ω-3 PUFAs reported that serum concentrations of total ω-3 PUFAs and DHA were signi ﬁcantly correlated with microbiome α-di- versity (Shannon index) after adjusting for confounders [ 73].J.H.Bae et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 612 –628 617 These associations remained signi ﬁcant after adjusting for di- etary ﬁber intake.An RCT with a sardine diet (100 g sardines for 5 d/wk for 6 mo providing ~3 g daily of an EPA and DHAcombination) in people with type 2 diabetes reported a signi ﬁ- cant decrease in the Firmicutes -to-Bacteroidetes ratio compared with control [ 74].
Eight weeks of ω-3 PUFA supplementation in healthy volunteers caused a consistent and reversible increase in the SCFA-producing intestinal microbiome [ 75]. However, a lack of signi ﬁcant changes in microbial diversity was found [ 75], consistent with a mice study in which there was either no or onlya tiny change in α-diversity [ 76].Of note, short-term dietary interventions could not alter the dominant interindividual vari-ation in the gut microbiome [ 77].Taken together, LC ω-3 PUFAs are likely to attenuate hyperglycemia and insulin resistance byaffecting the gut microbiome and metabolites linking the gut toadipose tissue, liver, and pancreas.Therefore, LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation might be helpful restore glucose homeostasis through favorable changes in the gut –organs axis.Effects on fatty liver The novel term metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has been proposed to replace nonalcoholicfatty liver disease (NAFLD) [ 78].
The concept of NAFLD has several pitfalls. NAFLD is a diagnosis of exclusion (thus not basedon positive diagnostic criteria that are more de ﬁnitive), and the histologic con ﬁrmation of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can be dif ﬁcult in some cases because of signi ﬁcant intra- and interobserver variability [ 78].A recent review has advocated redeﬁning this condition as MAFLD by raising concerns about the current de ﬁnition of NAFLD [ 79].Currently, the principal therapy for NAFLD involves dietary and lifestyle modi ﬁcations to lose body weight while improving liver steatosis and in ﬂammation [ 80,81].Pioglitazone, vitamin E, or their combination therapy can be used in people withNASH; however, there are no drugs with suf ﬁcient evidence.Some studies have proposed that dietary ω-3 PUFAs improve insulin resistance by regulating mitochondrial function and mediating anti-in ﬂammatory effects [ 82,83].
In a systemic re- view and meta-analysis of 17 human studies that evaluated theeffects of marine ω-3 PUFAs on NAFLD [ 84], 12 studies reported a decrease in liver fat or other markers of NAFLD after ω-3 PUFA supplementation. Five studies did not show any bene ﬁt in liver enzyme activities, which seemed to be owing to the relativelyshort duration of treatment, inadequate adherence, and meth-odological problems [ 84].Thus, LC ω-3 PUFAs can be used as adjuncts to lifestyle modi ﬁcations for treating patients with MAFLD.However, further well-designed RCTs are warranted.Effect of LC ω-3 PUFAs on CV Events in Large- Scale RCTs Although several prospective observational studies have reported that consuming LC ω-3 PUFAs prevented incident CAD [85], RCTs have shown discrepant results for CVD.
In the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell ’Infarto miocardico (GISSI)-Prevenzion e trial, supplementation with 1 g/d of ω-3 PUFAs therapy was associated with early protection from sudden cardiac death in patients who had a myocardialinfarction [ 86]. In Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study (JELIS)involving Japanese people with h ypercholesterolemia, addi- tional administration of 1.8 g EPA for 5 y reduced the incidenceof major coronary events compared with a statin alone (2.8%compared with 3.5%) [ 87].JELIS conducted an open-label, blinded endpoint evaluation.The mean LDL cholesterol con-centrations were 182 mg/dL at baseline but were not related to the reduction in major coronary events.In A Study of Cardio- vascular Events in Diabetes (ASCEND) involving people withtype 2 diabetes, administrating 1 g of ω- 3P U F A sf o r7yd i dn o t result in any difference in the incidence of any severe CVDcompared with placebo [ 29].
In Vitamin D and ω-3 Trial (VITAL), an RCT involving 25,871 adults with a 2 /C22 factorial d e s i g no fv i t a m i nD 3a n d1g / do fm a r i n e ω-3 PUFAs, MACE did not differ between the ω-3 PUFA and placebo groups during a median 5.3 y (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.06; P¼0.24) [ 88]. In the analysis of key secondary endpoints, HRs for totalmyocardial infarction, stroke, and CV death were 0.72 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.90), 1.04 (95% CI: 0.83, 1.31), and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.21), respectively [ 88].In REDUCE-IT, which involved people with established CVD or type 2 diabetes plus /C211 additional CV risk factor, taking 4 g/ d IPE signi ﬁcantly lowered risk of major ischemic events by 25% compared with a mineral oil placebo [ 5].STRENGTH adminis- tered an ω-3 carboxylic acid formulation (EPA and DHA) at a dose of 4 g/d in people with atherogenic dyslipidemia andestablished ASCVD or high CV risk.
However, STRENGTH wasterminated early because it did not show any bene ﬁts compared with a corn oil placebo in the interim evaluation [ 6]. Besides the types or doses of LC ω-3 PUFAs, there were differences in study populations and comparators between the 2 studies.The pro-portions of people with secondary prevention were 70.7% and55.6% in REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH, respectively, at baseline.REDUCE-IT used mineral oil as a comparator, which increasedLDL cholesterol ( þ10%), non-HDL cholesterol ( þ9%), apoB (þ8%), and CRP ( þ32%) from baseline [ 89].In contrast, corn oil used as a comparator in STRENGTH showed neutral effects onlipid pro ﬁles and a slight decrease in CRP ( /C06%) [ 89].
In the Effect of Vascepa on Improving Coronary Atherosclerosis inPeople With High Triglycerides Taking Statin Therapy (EVAP- ORATE), which used similar eligibility criteria to REDUCE-IT, administration of 4 g/d IPE signi ﬁcantly reduced plaque vol- ume assessed by coronary CT angiography compared with pla-cebo over 18 mo ( /C017% compared with þ109%) [ 90]. The median TG concentrations were 259.1 mg/dL at baseline.EVAPORATE also showed no difference in plaque progressionbetween mineral oil and cellulose-based placebos, partlyexplaining the CV bene ﬁt observed in REDUCE-IT [ 90].How- ever, there are concerns about normalizing baseline plaque vol-ume and blind assessment of plaque quanti ﬁcation.Therefore, additional evidence is needed to support the association of LC ω-3 PUFAs with preventing CVD.To provide a precise estimate of treatment effects, we con- ducted a meta-analysis of RCTs investigating the effects of LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation on CV outcomes.
We searched MEDLINE(via PubMed) up to March 2022 to identify eligible studies thatreported outcomes of interest with /C21500 participants and /C211y of follow-up. We included 17 studies involving 143,410 partic-ipants ranging from 546 to 25,871 in each study.Two studiesused EPA alone [ 5,87], and the remaining studies used EPA and DHA combinations in the intervention group.All except 3 studiesJ.H.Bae et al.

We also conducted subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to assess whether theeffects of LC ω-3 PUFAs varied according to the important factors related to its ef ﬁcacy as follows. 1) Types of LC ω-3 PUFAs: EPA and DHA combination or EPA alone 2) Doses of LC ω-3 PUFAs: EPA plus DHA and EPA 3) Comparators: corn oil, mineral oil, olive oil, others, or no placebo 4) Types of prevention: primary prevention, secondary pre- vention, or bothStatistical analyses were performed using R version 4.0.4.P values <0.05 were considered statistically signi ﬁcant for the outcomes and tests for heterogeneity.Three-point MACE and its components LCω-3 PUFA supplementation did not affect risk of MACE compared with controls (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.04; P¼ 0.366) ( Figure 3 ).There was substantial heterogeneity across the studies ( I2¼68%, τ2¼0.010, P¼0.001).
When assessing its components, LC ω-3 PUFAs led to a 17% and 16% RR reduction in fatal or nonfatal MI (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.95; P¼0.010) and CV death (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99; P¼0.029) (Figure 3 ). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 175 and 373, respectively.LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation had no signi ﬁcant effect on fatal or nonfatal stroke (RR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.90, 1.14; P ¼0.823) ( Figure 3 ).In subgroup analyses, there were no differences in MACE ac- cording to the types of LC ω-3 PUFAs and prevention ( Figure 4 , Supplemental Figure 3 ).However, a signi ﬁcant difference was FIGURE 3.Risks of cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in people randomly assigned to LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation compared with controls.LC, long-chain; MACE, major adverse cardiovascular events.FIGURE 4.Subgroup analyses for 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events by type and comparator of LC ω-3 PUFAs and study populations.LC, long-chain.J.H.Bae et al.

Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 612 –628 622 All-cause mortality LCω-3 PUFA supplementation had no signi ﬁcant effect on risk of all-cause mortality (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.02; P¼ 0.274) ( Figure 3 ,Supplemental Figure 5 ). There was no signi ﬁ- cant heterogeneity across the studies.There was no subgroupdifference or dose response for all-cause mortality.HHF Risk of HHF was not reduced with LC ω-3 PUFA supplemen- tation (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.07; P¼0.431) ( Figure 3 , Supplemental Figure 6 ).There was no signi ﬁcant heterogeneity across the studies.Although LC ω-3 PUFAs reduced risk of HHF by 32% (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.88) in Risk and Preventiontrial [ 93], a sensitivity analysis excluding this study did not alter the direction of the treatment effect (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.93,1.06).No subgroup difference or dose response was found for HHF.
New-onset atrial ﬁbrillation LCω-3 PUFA supplementation signi ﬁcantly increased risk of new-onset atrial ﬁbrillation (RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.39; P< 0.001), with moderate heterogeneity across the studies ( I2¼ 51%, τ2¼0.011, P¼0.047) ( Figure 3 ,Supplemental Figure 7 ). The number needed to harm was 153.Meta-regression analysisshowed that a signi ﬁcant dose response was observed in new- onset atrial ﬁbrillation with EPA plus DHA supplementation ( P ¼0.022) ( Figure 5 B).This result was consistent with a previous study ﬁnding of a dose-related increase in atrial ﬁbrillation risk over an ω-3 PUFA supplementation range of 1 g/d to 4 g/d [ 94].In people with established CVD or multiple CV risk factors, LC ω-3 PUFAs increased risk of atrial ﬁbrillation [ 5,6,95].Given the NNT for 3-point MACE was 175 in our study, these ﬁndings suggest that the use of LC ω-3 PUFAs should be tailored based on risk of ASCVD and atrial ﬁbrillation.
Of note, EPA did not show such a relationship ( P¼0.087) ( Supplemental Figure 8 ). Accumulating evidence suggests that ω-3 PUFAs can affect a new class of ion channels called PIEZO1 that functions as amechanical sensor in cellular membranes [ 96].This channel involves multiple biological processes, including mechanicalstress-induced signaling in atrial cells such as ﬁbroblasts [ 97].PIEZO1 activity in atrial ﬁbroblasts increased in people with atrial ﬁbrillation, suggesting that PIEZO1 might contribute to the structural and electrical remodeling of the atrium [ 98].The administration of ω-3 PUFAs may affect PIEZO1 activity, pro- longing action potential duration and increasing the propensityfor delayed after depolarizations that trigger atrial ﬁbrillation [97].Other adverse events There have been questions about whether ω-3 PUFAs increase risk of bleeding.LC ω-3 PUFAs revealed no excess risks of bleeding or other serious adverse events in the VITAL study [ 88].
In REDUCE-IT, there was a slightly higher rate of minor bleedingwith IPE compared with the placebo [ 5]. However, no signi ﬁcant increase in fatal bleeding, such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding, was observed in the IPE group [ 5].In STRENGTH, treatment-emergent adverse events were morecommon in the LC ω-3 PUFA group than in the corn oil placebo group (22.2% compared with 12.9%) [ 6].Gastrointestinal adverse events also occurred more frequently in the LC ω-3 PUFAgroup than in the control group (24.7% compared with 14.7%) [6].However, there were no differences in the rates of bleeding events between the 2 groups [ 6].The overall adverse events were similar between the LC ω-3 PUFAs and placebos groups in REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH [ 5,6].Implications Our meta-analysis demonstrates that LC ω-3 PUFA supple- mentation reduces risk of CV death and myocardial infarction ina dose-dependent manner.
However, it is noteworthy that the CV beneﬁts from LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation differed according to the comparators. LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation had no sig- niﬁcant effect on all-cause mortality and HHF.However, LC ω-3 PUFA treatment signi ﬁcantly increased risk of new-onset atrial ﬁbrillation.Differences in various factors, including the types or doses of LCω-3 PUFAs, control groups, and study populations, could affect the inconsistent results of LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation.To investigate the role of these factors, we conducted meticulousmeta-analyses using strict eligibility criteria of the RCTsinvolving LC ω-3 PUFAs.The con ﬂicting CV effects of LC ω-3 PUFAs could arise from different comparators.In REDUCE-IT [ 5] and its substudies [99–101], IPE robustly reduced ischemic events across a broad range of populations.The main criticism of the REDUCE-IT hasbeen that using a mineral oil placebo might contribute to thebeneﬁcial effects of IPE [ 89].
A cohort study mimicking trial designs showed that the contrasting results of REDUCE-IT andSTRENGTH could partly be explained by different effects ofcomparators on the lipid pro ﬁle and CRP concentrations [ 89]. However, the CV bene ﬁts of IPE in REDUCE-IT were consistent regardless of the background statin therapy, indicating that lip- ophilicity of statins or undesirable interaction of statins with mineral oil was not the primary driver of IPE ’s clinical ef ﬁcacy [102].In addition, EPA and DHA have different chemical properties and might have distinct effects on cell membrane structure, lipidoxidation, in ﬂammatory markers, and endothelial function related to atherosclerosis [ 21].Although it is unclear whether DHA may diminish or negate the bene ﬁts of EPA, the effect of combined treatment of DHA with EPA needs to be assessedfurther.
Circulating and tissue concentrations of ω-3 PUFAs at baseline might also be crucial in determining the effects of ω-3 PUFA supplementation on CV events [ 7,9]. However, clinical studies of ω-3 PUFA therapy often provided insuf ﬁcient information of PUFA concentrations in the blood or tissue, which maycontribute to discordant ﬁndings.In STRENGTH [ 6], the circu- lating EPA concentration was 89.6 μg/mL at the end of the study, which is much lower than the EPA concentrations in JELIS (169 μg/mL) [ 87] and REDUCE-IT (144.0 μg/mL) [ 5].The major shortcoming of previous studies is that the authors did notmeasure circulating concentrations of ω-3 PUFAs at baseline and at follow-up.Without these measurements, it is dif ﬁcult to evaluate the effects of an intervention on changes in ω-3 PUFA concentrations and health outcomes.
Future studies should pro- vide information on ω-3 PUFA status by measuring serum [ 5]o r plasma concentrations [ 6], percentage of total red blood cell FAs [6], percentage of total plasma lipids [ 103], or the balance of ω-3 highly unsaturated FAs [ 7].J.H. Bae et al.Advances in Nutrition 14 (2023) 612 –628 623 Thus, there are several limitations and caveats in the inter- pretation of studies on LC ω-3 PUFAs.First, the effects of circulating ω-3 PUFA concentrations on each outcome were not examined.Second, backgr ound diets, including ﬁsh and ﬁsh oils, may affect the effectiveness of LC ω-3 PUFA supplemen- tation [ 7,9].Third, ω-6 PUFA intake might in ﬂuence the effects of LC ω-3 PUFAs by altering the conversion and storage of ω-3 PUFAs [ 7,9].
Use of LC ω-3 PUFAs from a Clinical Perspective In 2019, the AHA and the European Society of Cardiology released guidelines that LC ω-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA combi- nation or EPA alone) can be prescribed to decrease circulatingTG concentrations and reduce residual CV risk on top of statintreatment [ 104,105]. JELIS showed that 1.8 g of EPA ethyl ester effectively reduced MACE in Japanese people with hypercho-lesterolemia [ 87].In RECUCE-IT involving high-risk people on statin therapy, the use of 4 g/d IPE for improving risk of severe ASCVD in people with high TG is supported by a 25% reductionin MACE [ 5].On the other hand, STRENGTH, which evaluated the effect of 4 g/d ω-3 carboxylic acids (EPA and DHA) in people with high TG concentrations and low HDL cholesterol concen-trations on statin treatment, failed to prove the CV bene ﬁts [6].
Moreover, an increased risk of atrial ﬁbrillation, particularly noticed in REDUCE-IT [ 5] and STRENGTH [ 6], requires a balanced approach to LC ω-3 PUFA therapy CVD prevention and potentially harmful effects. However, LC ω-3 PUFAs generally have good safety and tolerability.To date, <5% of participants have discontinued taking LC ω-3 PUFAs due to adverse events in major RCTs [ 5,6].Current evidence suggests that 1.8 g/d of EPA for East Asians and 4 g/d of IPE for Western people reduce theresidual CV risk.This recommendation stems from the result thata plasma EPA concentration (170 μg/mL) from 1.8 g/d of EPA in a Japanese population was similar to that obtained from 4 g/d ofIPE used in a Western population (183 μg/mL) [ 106].In conclusion, Mechanistic and clinical studies support that LCω-3 PUFAs have protective effects on the CV system via multiple pathways.
LC ω-3 PUFAs lower TG concentrations, ameliorate in ﬂammation, directly act on blood vessels, and improve vascular endothelial cell function, including vasodila- tion. In addition, LC ω-3 PUFAs act on platelets to reduce abnormal activation and serve as a component of the bloodvessel wall to have a vascular protective effect.Although DHAhas shown a neuroprotective effect, evidence of the CV bene ﬁts is limited.By contrast, as reported in JELIS [ 87] and REDUCE-IT [5], long-term administration of EPA alone was effective in reducing CV events, which was not found in STRENGTH, whichused EPA and DHA in combination [ 6].For these reasons, a potential strategy to be considered in designing future clinicaltrials would be to use EPA alone or to combine EPA and DHA fortherapeutic regimens of LC ω-3 PUFAs.In addition, further studies are warranted to investigate the similarities and differ- ences in the underlying mechanisms linked with speci ﬁc effects of EPA and DHA.
