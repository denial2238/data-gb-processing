Conclusion: In this meta-analysis of 2,147 patients with acute MI under-going PCI, SGLT2i signi ﬁcantly reduced all-cause mortality and severe arrhythmia compared to no SGLT2i therapy.

Herein, we demonstratebone restoration in a preclinical model of established diabetesby two bone anabolic pathways: activation of the PTH1 recep-tor, with equimolar doses of either PTH (1-34) orAbaloparatide/ABL (100/95 µg/kg/day), and neutralization ofthe osteocyte-derived inhibitor of bone formation sclerostinwith romosozumab/Scl-Ab (100mg/kg/w).Type 2 diabetes(T2D) was induced in skeletally mature male C57BL/6Jmice by high fat diet combined with streptozotocin; and, afterestablished diabetes, mice were treated for 4 weeks with thebone anabolic agents.
At the end of the study, T2D mice exhib-ited decreased total ( −5%), femoral ( −7%) and spinal ( −11%) BMD vs nondiabetic mice. PTH/ABL restored the bone lostand increased BMD to a similar extent: total 8%, femoral11% and spinal 9% vs vehicle-treated T2D mice.Scl-Ab alsoincreased BMD at all sites, but the effects were superior: total24%, femoral 26%, and spinal 40%.T2D mice exhibited lowbone formation (BF) and high bone resorption (BR) circulatingmarkers throughout the disease progression.However, at thetissue level BF and BR were suppressed as evidenced by his-tomorphometric indexes (BFR −70%; Oc.S/BS -34%) and bone transcriptome GO pro ﬁles.PTH/ABL increased BF (BFR∼700% and P1NP 130/244%) as well as BR (Oc.S/BS un- changed/34%; TRAP5b ∼200%) and corrected the diabetic low bone remodeling signature towards high bone remodelingwith bone gain.In contrast, Scl-Ab increased formation(BFR 500% and P1NP 50%) but drastically decreased resorp-tion (TRAP5b −190% and Oc.S/BS −500%).
T2D mice exhib- ited damaged bone microarchitecture. The reduced femoraland spinal cancellous bone BV/TV ( −22 and −10%) was cor- rected by ABL (40 and 42%), Scl-Ab (130 and 83%), andPTH only in the spine (43%).Further, femoral and spinal tra-becular thickness were increased equally by PTH/ABL (35 and 24%) and also by Scl-Ab (60 and 66%).Moreover, the de- creased cortical thickness ( −7%) and BA/TA ( −5%) at the fem- oral mid-diaphysis of T2D mice were corrected and furtherincreased by PTH/ABL (10 and 11%) and Scl-Ab (23 and19%).Yet, whereas PTH reduced marrow area, ABL increasedtissue area TA, and Scl-Ab exerted both effects, resulting inadvantageous bone distribution by ABL and Scl-Ab leadingto increased energy to ultimate load (60 and 90%) and tough-ness (50 and 82%).
Nevertheless, all agents corrected the lowstiffness of T2D bone (-19%) and also increased ultimate load.These ﬁndings demonstrate the therapeutic value of bone anabolic agents to treat diabetes-induced bone disease by in-creasing bone formation and improving bone microarchitec-ture and show the bene ﬁt of simultaneously inhibiting resorption to achieve superior bone gain and strength.
