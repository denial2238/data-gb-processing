Taking into consideration the medicinal importance of Withania somnifera (L.) (ashwagandha), the present study assessed the potential hazards of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) and the toxicity amelioration by a metal-tolerant plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR). Bacillus mojavensis BZ-13 (NCBI accession number MZ950923) recovered from metal-polluted rhizosphere soil, tolerated an exceptionally high level of Ag-NPs.The growth-regulating substances synthesized by B.mojavensis were increased with increasing concentrations (0 −1000 μgm L −1) of Ag-NPs.Also, strain BZ-13 had the ability to form bio ﬁlm, produce alginate and exopolysaccharides (EPSs), as well maintain swimming and swarming motilities in the presence of Ag-NPs.Soil application of varying concentrations of Ag-NPs resulted in a dose-relatedreduction in growth and biochemical features of ashwagandha.In contrast, following soil inoculation, B.
mojavensis relieved the Ag- NPs-induced phytotoxicity and improved plant productivity. Root, shoot length, dry biomass, and leaf area increased by 13, 17, 37,25%, respectively, when B.mojavensis was applied with 25 mg/kg Ag-NPs when compared to noninoculated controls.Furthermore, the soil plant analysis development (SPAD) index, photosystem e ﬃciency (Fv/Fm), PS II quantum yield (FPS II), photochemical quenching (qP), non-photochemical quenching (NpQ), and total chlorophyll and carotenoid content of BZ-13-inoculated plants inthe presence of 25 mg Ag-NPs/kg increased by 33, 29, 41, 47, 35, 26, and 25%, respectively, when compared to noninoculatedcontrols that were exposed to the same amounts of NPs.In addition, a signi ﬁcant ( p≤0.05) increase in 48, 18, 21, and 19% in withaferin-A (alkaloids), ﬂavonoids, phenols, and tannin content, respectively, was recorded when plants were detached from bacterized and Ag-NP-treated plants.
Leaf gas exchange parameters were also modulated in the case of inoculated plants.Furthermore, bacterial inoculation signi ﬁcantly decreased proline, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes, and Ag-NP ’s absorption and build-up in phyto-organs. In conclusion, soil inoculation with B.mojavensis may possibly be used as an alternative to protect W.continued...Received: January 13, 2022 Accepted: March 22, 2022 Published: April 17, 2022 Article http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf © 2022 The Authors.Published by American Chemical Society 13878https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c00262 ACS Omega 2022, 7, 13878 −13893 somnifera plants in soil contaminated with nanoparticles.Therefore, phytohormone and other biomolecule-synthesizing and NP- tolerant PGPR strains like B.
mojavensis might serve as an agronomically signi ﬁcant and cost-e ﬀective remediation agent for augmenting the yield and productivity of medicinally important plants like ashwagandha raised in soil contaminated withnanoparticles in general and Ag-NPs in particular. ■INTRODUCTION The fast growth of nanotechnology has resulted in the development, use, and commercialization of a wide range of goods using engineered nanoparticles.1Contamination with nanoparticles (NPs) arises from di ﬀerent anthropogenic sources including residential wastewater e ﬄuents, treatment plants, and industries such as agriculture, biomedicine, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and aerospace.2Nanoparticles are discharged into the environment (both deliberately and unintentionally) and then cause harmful consequences to agricultural crops.
Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) are a kind of NP that are widely employed in a variety of comme rcial (textiles/clothing, household appliances like refrigerators, furniture, cosmetics, and even children toys)3and medicinal (surgical and non- surgical equipment like wound dressings, bandages, catheters, etc.) applications.4−6 The discharge of Ag-NPs into aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems during manufacturing processes and from various commercial goods has become a signi ﬁcant ecotoxicological concern. Speci ﬁcally, the increased production, use, and release of Ag-NPs from diverse goods have caused concerns about their harmful e ﬀects on agricultural crops.The NPs ’prolonged durability7and low disintegration rate, in addition to their buildup in terrestrial ecosystems, exacerbate the phytotoxicity issues.The NPs physically interact with plants and are absorbed by their roots, resulting in plant organ absorption and accumulation.
Plant accumulation of NPs is a ﬀected by exposure period, exposure medium, and size of nanoparticles, dose rates, and chemistry of surface. Higher NPs accumulation in plant organs, as well as translocation to edible plant parts can limitgrowth, biomass, and crop production while also transferring NPs to the next trophic level.8Reports on phytotoxic e ﬀects of Ag-NPs on various agronomically important crops are available.For instance, Rani et al.9reported that following accumulation in root systems, Ag-NPs caused production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Pisum sativum (L.) that ultimately caused cell death.
Likewise, exposure to excess concentrations of Ag-NPs exhibited delayed germination, reduced ﬂowering and ﬂoral development, decreased the viability of petal and pollen formation, and decreased pod production in Arabidopsis thaliana .10In an study, a Ag-NP concentration-dependent decrease in root biomass and plant length and changes in structural responses of Hordeum vulgare (L.) were observed by González Linares et al.11Furthermore, Ag-NPs caused severe phytotoxic e ﬀects on Triticum aestivum and decreased the length, biomass, micronutrients, protein, and amino acids and increased the bioconcentration of Ag in di ﬀerent plant organs.12 In addition, studies by Nair and Chung13on various levels of Ag- NPs showed the toxic e ﬀects on Vigna radiata (L.) seedlings by altering their physiological and molecular processes. As a result, new, ecologically friendly, and cost-e ﬀective techniques for avoiding the consequences of nanoparticles must be devised.
One of these might be the utilization of indigenous rhizosphere bacteria capable of stimulating plant development through the synthesis of growth-promoting bioactive com-pounds that could reduce nanophytotoxicity. The currentinvestigation ’s goal was to assess a metal-tolerant plant growth-promoting rhizobacterial (PGPR) strain under nano-particle stress and its bioinoculation e ﬀect on ashwagandha plants.The strain was chosen because soil microorganisms (i)have a variety of methods for surviving extended periods of metalexposure in soils and (ii) carry out the biological transformationor conversion of metals to a less harmful form.Numerous rootcolonizing PGPR such as Azotobacter salinestris , 14Bacillus cereus , Pseudomonas fluorescens andPlanomicrobium chinense ,15Bacillus cereus ,16Pseudomonas sp.,17andRhizobium meliloti18have been used for cleanup of polluted soil and reduction of metal stress incrops.
The strategies used by rhizosphere bacteria that can leadto plant protection include (i) chelating metals in therhizosphere via overproduction of exopolysaccharides andother metal-chelating compounds and (ii) intracellular metalfraction pumping. 19Bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produce compounds that interact with metals and inhibit the entry of metal into the root system, decreasing metal toxicity torhizosphere bacteria and also protecting plants from abioticstressors.20 Withania somnifera L.Dunal (Ashwagandha) is a popular medicinal plant cultivated throughout the world.The primaryactive components identi ﬁed and described from Withania somnifera are alkaloids and withanolides.The therapeutic beneﬁts of leaves including antibacterial, antitumor, and anti- inﬂammatory characteristics are linked to withanolide-D, which has a strong antitumor activity.The main withanolides extractedfrom the plant include withanolide-E, which has immune-suppressive properties.
Also, several illnesses such as leprosy,neurological problems, intestinal infections, and rheumatism aretreated with leaf extracts of ashwagandha. 21The berries and seeds are diuretics that are also used to alleviate chest problems.Additionally, ashwagandha has been found in studies to behelpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, in ﬂammation, stroke, and osteoarthritis.Ashwagandha is utilized to relax themind, reduce weakness and nervous weariness, increase sexualvitality, and promote restful sleep.22Many research inves- tigations have shown that the fruits and leaves of ashwagandhacontain a variety of phytochemicals with antioxidant activities,which are responsible for their good health e ﬀects.23 In light of these considerations, a series of experiments was devised to achieve the following objectives: (i) assess the toxicityof Ag-NPs in W.
somnifera (L.) grown in vitro , (ii) isolate and identify soil bacteria and determine their tolerance toward Ag-NPs, (iii) assess the di ﬀerent rates of Ag-NPs on bio ﬁlm- associated traits and plant growth-regulating substances in B. mojavensis BZ 13 strain, (iv) assess the impact of B.mojavensis BZ-13 strain on dry biomass, leaf chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, and carotenoid contents in the leaves of W.somnifera (L.) treated with di ﬀerent amounts of Ag-NPs, (v) determine the alkaloid and polyphenol contents in roots of bioinoculated and NP-treated W.somnifera (L.), (vi) determine the leaf exchange parameters and Ag-NPs uptake in di ﬀerent organs of B.mojavensis -inoculated and Ag-NP-treated W.
somnifera (L.), and (vii) determine the proline, MDA, and antioxidant activityin root tissues of bacteria-inoculated and NP-treated plants.ACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Article https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c00262 ACS Omega 2022, 7, 13878 −1389313879 ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Toxicity of Ag-NPs to W. somnifera (L.) in Vitro .Germination, Length, and Vigor Indices.Seed germination is, undoubtedly, the initial step toward crop establishment success.As a result, the most important physiognomies of theseeds to be employed for cultivation are seed germination and seedling vigor index.Seeds that germinate quickly and aggressively in controlled circumstances are likely to generaterobust seedlings in the ﬁeld as well.Hence, seed germination has been frequently utilized as an indicator to assess Ag-NP-induced phytotoxicity.Higher dosages exhibited the most deleterious impact on seedling biological characteristics among theconcentrations used in the present work.
As an example,germination rate ( Figure 1 A), radicle length ( Figure 1 B), plumule length ( Figure 1 C), and vigor index ( Figure 1 D) of W. somnifera (L.) were maximally reduced by 69, 78, 90, and 70%, respectively, when exposed to higher (1000 μgm L −1)concentrations of Ag-NPs.Changes in seed germination of several plant species caused by various NPs have been reported to con ﬁrm the present ﬁndings.For instance, when exposed to 2000 mg L−1cerium dioxide (CeO2) NPs, a considerable decrease in germination e ﬃciency of edible crops (tomato, maize, and cucumber) was recorded as reported by Lo ́pez- Moreno et al.24Similarly, metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) viz., TiO 2,A l 2O3, and CuO, reduced growth features of Allium cepa under in vitro conditions.25 Changes in Root Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm).Using in vivo histochemical staining with Rhodamine 123 (Rh123), the in ﬂuence of various doses of Ag-NPs on the mitochondrial membrane potential of roots of W.
somnifera (L.) plants was qualitatively evaluated. Here, as a result of exposure toincreasing concentrations of Ag-NPs, changes in mitochondrialmembrane potential ( ΔΨm) were seen in the roots of Ag-NP- exposed plants, as shown by enhanced Rh123 ﬂuorescence (Figure 1 a−f).Since mitochondria are the origins of cell ROS Figure 1.Toxicity evaluation of Ag-NPs using Withania somnifera (L.) plants in vitro ; seed germination (A), radicle length (B), plumule length (C), and seedling vigor index (D) of W.somnifera (L.) seeds germinated on soft agar plates treated with di ﬀerent rates of Ag-NPs.Panels a −f represent CLSM images of NP-induced cellular permeability in the roots of W.somnifera (L.) treated with 0, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 mg kg−1Ag-NPs, respectively.In panels A −D, the bar diagrams represent the mean values of ﬁve replicates ( n= 5).

In line with the current ﬁnding, Nair and Chung13found that exposure to Ag-NPs caused substantial alterations in ΔΨminVigna radiata (L).Similarly, Faisal et al.27 has shown that exposure to nickel oxide nanoparticles caused changes in ΔΨminSolanum lycopersicum (L.) seedling roots, resulting in increased Rh123 ﬂuorescence due to alterations in mitochondrial membrane permeability.Biochemical Characterization, Ag-NPs Tolerance, and Molecular Identi ﬁcation of BZ-13.
Because nanoparticles are often discharged into the soil environment, it is critical to understand some of the negative consequences of nanoparticlesin agriculturally important crops including medicinal plants. When entered into soil systems, NPs adversely a ﬀect thephysiological and biochemical features of crops.To address this issue, we attempted to identify metal-tolerant soil bacteria, which may be a microbiological resource, and it has the potentialto be utilized to increase agricultural performance by reducingthe metal toxicity.In this work, 20 rhizopheric isolates were collected, and their morphological and biochemical features were investigated.Bacterial isolates showed a varied responsetoward the biochemical tests.When grown on Ag-NP- supplemented agar plates, strain BZ-13 withstood the highest concentration (1600 μgmL −1) of Ag-NPs among PGPR isolates.Strain BZ-13 was chosen for inoculation in crop experimentsbased on its Ag-NPs tolerance characteristics.
Bacterial strain BZ-13 showed a positive response toward a number of biochemical reactions. This strain (BZ-13) belonged to thegenus Bacillus on the basis of physiological and cultural factors.In addition, 16S rRNA partial gene sequencing was used toFigure 2.Plant growth-regulating (PGR) substances synthesized by Bacillus mojavensis BZ-13 strains under di ﬀerent concentrations (0 −1200 μg mL−1) of Ag-NPs stress; indole-3-acetic acid (A), 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylate (ACC) deaminase (B), ammonia (C), phosphate solubilization (D), siderophore: salicylic acid (E) and 2,3-dihdroxy benzoic acid, DHBA (F).Here, bar diagrams represent the mean values of three replicates ( n= 3).Mean values followed by di ﬀerent letters are signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent at p≤0.05 according to Duncan ’s multiple range (DMRT) test.

The strain BZ-13 ’s 16S rRNA nucleotide sequences (about 1400 bp in size) weredeposited to GenBank (NCBI Accession NumberMZ950923.1).For a similarity search, BLASTn software was employed that revealed BZ-13 strain was nearly and strongly related to Bacillus mojavensis NRLL-B 14698 (EU138460).Because of the maximum similarity, strain BZ-13 was identi ﬁed and con ﬁrmed as Bacillus mojavensis .Furthermore, using the 16S rRNA partial sequences already present in the NCBI database, aphylogenic tree was constructed for Bacillus mojavensis BZ-13 (Figure S1 ).In this regard, a number of metal/nanoparticle- tolerant agriculturally important soil bacteria have been isolated from di ﬀerent metal-polluted areas and characterized using partial gene sequencing.
28−31 PGP Substances of B. mojavensis under Ag-NPs Stress.Indole-3-acetic Acid, Side rophore, ACC Deaminase, P- Solubilization, NH3, and HCN.The plant growth-regulating bioactive molecule produced by Bacillus mojavensis strain BZ-13 was evaluated by growing cells in Ag-NP-supplemented growthmedium.It was observed that even at a higher Ag-NPs dosage, IAA synthesized by Bacillus mojavensis was not signi ﬁcantly reduced.However, production of IAA was increased withincreasing concentrations of Ag-NPs ( Figure 2 A).Bacillus mojavensis BZ-13 synthesized 56.4 ±5.7μgIAAmL −1in the absence of NP stress, which, however, increased with the Ag-NP concentration.For example, at 1200 μgm L−1Ag-NP concentration, IAA produced by BZ-13 strain increased by 58% over controls.Plant bene ﬁcial bacteria reduce the negative impacts of environmental contaminants and, as a result,improved the crop yield in stressed soils.32In a similar investigation, Sphingomonas sp.
produced the phytohormone gibberellins, which signi ﬁcantly enhanced the growth indices of plants.33Because Ag-NPs, even after prolonged exposure, may have no e ﬀect on the functional pro ﬁle of the soil microbial population, IAA generation remained una ﬀected.34 Even when grown on medium added with increasing rates of Ag-NPs solution, strain BZ-13 exhibited a good sensitivity to ACC deaminase. B.mojavensis generated 17.7 μMα- ketobutyrate mg−1protein h−1at a higher concentration (1200 μgm L−1Ag-NPs), which is 61% (45.7 μMα-ketobutyrate mg−1protein h−1) higher than the amount of ACC deaminase produced at a lower concentration (0 μgm L−1Ag-NPs) ( Figure 2B).Similarly, two nitrogen- ﬁxing PGPR isolates ( A.
nigricans andAzorhizophilus paspali ) have been shown to produced ACC deaminase activity under metal-stressed conditions that couldhelp to manage the growth and health of Helianthus anuus .35 Furthermore, chitosan NP-r esistant and ACC deaminase producing soil bacterium Bacillus licheniformis protected plantsfrom damaging e ﬀects of phytopathogens and improved the overall crop growth.36 Similarly, the increasing concentrations of Ag-NPs did not show any adverse impacts on NH 3(Figure 2 panel C) and HCN production. At all concentrations, B.mojavensis exhibited HCN and ammonia production.After Nessler ’s reagent was added, a yellow-brown tint color developed, suggesting that the ammoniaproduction test was positive.Plant growth is said to beinﬂuenced by ammonia production in an indirect way.Many soil-dwelling bacteria produce HCN (a well-known secondary metabolite), which is thought to have an imperative role in thebiological control of plant diseases.
Certain species of Bacillus have been implicated in the control of soil-borne diseases by producing HCN. 37,38Similarly, several studies have shown that metal-resistant soil bacteria cultivated in stressed medium produce ammonia and cyanogenic compounds.39−41 Phosphatic fertilizers (PF) are used often in agricultural regions to compensate for soil P shortage.42Phosphate fertilizers are absorbed in smaller amounts by plants, and the rest is quicklytransformed into insoluble complexes in the soil.However, using phosphate fertilizers on a regular basis is not only expensive but also harmful to the environment.43As a result, researchers are looking for an environmentally friendly and cost-e ﬀective way to boost crop output in low-phosphorus soils.
So, organisms with P-solubilizing activity, also known as phosphate-solubilizingmicroorganisms (PSM), may feed plants with the accessible forms of P and hence serve as a viable alternative to chemical fertilizers.44,45Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) are regarded promising biofertilizers because they may feed plants with P from sources that are ordinarily inaccessible to plants through diverse mechanisms.46Naturally, inorganic phosphorus is solubilized as a result of the action of low molecular weight organic acids generated by diverse soil microorganisms. Considering the importance of P, the amount of solubilized Pby strain BZ-13 was assessed under NPs stress, and the quantumof solubilized P was increased with increasing Ag-NPs concentrations ( Figure 2 D).In iron (Fe)-de ﬁcient situations, siderophore, a low molecular weight (LMW) Fe-chelating molecule produced by soil microbial species, supplies Fe to plants.
Siderophore synthesisby bacterial strains, like IAA, has risen with increasing rates of Ag-NPs. As an example, BZ-13 synthesized 17.6 ±1.1μgmL −1 salicylic acid (SA), which, however, increased by 66% (52 ±1.56 μgm L−1) at 1200 μgm L−1Ag-NPs ( Figure 2 E).Also, the amount of 2,3-dihydroxy benzoic acid consistently increased with the enhancement in cumulative Ag-NP concentration(Figure 2 F).Likewise, di ﬀerent concentrations of nanoparticles (CuO and ZnO) di ﬀerentially a ﬀect the ﬂuorescent siderophoreTable 1.

Under in vitro conditions, the e ﬀect of varying levels of Ag-NPs on bio ﬁlm formation, cell adhesion ability to hydrocarbons, and motility of B.mojavensis BZ-13 was investigated.In the context of Ag-NPs stress, the formation of bacterial bio ﬁlm was enhanced in a dose-dependent way ( Table 1 ).The in ﬂuence of Ag-NPs stress on EPS synthesis by B.mojavensis was investigated in order to better understand the biological consequences of extra polymeric substances (EPS) produced by a range of soil bacterial communities.
Strain BZ-13 synthesized a substantial quantity of EPS (112.0 ±7.7 g mL−1) in controlled conditions (NP free media), which, however, increased dramati cally with increasing Ag-NP concentrations. It has been demonstrated that polymeric compounds generated and released under extracellular con-ditions by soil bacteria play a signi ﬁcant role in crop protection against abiotic stresses.48In certain investigations, bacterial EPShas also been shown to protect agricultural plants against the harmful e ﬀects of phagocytosis and infections.49,50 The synthesis of alginate, ability to form swimming and swarming motility, and the CSH of strain BZ-13, like other bioﬁlm characteristics, increased with increasing concentrations of Ag-NPs.The swarming and swimming motility of the BZ-13strain were measured as 34 mm and 30 mm, respectively, at 0 μg Ag-NP mL −1, but increased by 24% and 25%, respectively, when the Ag-NP concentration was increased 0 to 1200 μgm L−1 (Table 1 ).
The hydrophobicity of bacterial cell surfaces is connected to bacterial cell adhesion and aggregation, as well as bioﬁlm development. The capacity of the metal/NP-tolerant PGPR strain to form bio ﬁlms and produce related characteristics even at greater concentrations of Ag-NPs is a strong indicator that it may tolerate even harsher nanoparticle stress conditions and enhance the growth of plants.Likewise, the bio ﬁlm-forming and EPS-producing soil bacterium Azotobacter salinestris protected Lycopersicum escu- lentum (L.) crops from adverse impacts of di ﬀerent metal oxide Figure 3.Panel A depicts W.somnifera (L.) plants grown in soils treated with increasing concentrations of Ag-NPs.Panel B depicts the inoculation eﬀect of Bacillus mojavensis BZ-13 on W.somnifera raised in soil added with di ﬀerent concentrations of Ag-NPs.The bioinoculation impact of NP- tolerant B.

Plants.Plant Length, Leaf Number, Leaf Area, and Berry Number.The e ﬀect of Ag-NP-tolerant B.
mojavensis on the germination rate and biological characteristics ( Figure 3A,B) of W.somnifera (L.) seedlings exposed to di ﬀerent concentrations of Ag-NPs in sandy clay loam soil was dissimilar.In general, B. mojavensis BZ-13 improved seed germination even in NP-a ﬀected soil.For instance, at 100 mg Ag-NPs kg −1soil, strain BZ-13 increased the germination e ﬃciency by 19%, over noninoculated controls ( Figure 3 C).Plant growth character- istics were reduced by increasing the dosage of Ag-NPs, but in the presence of B.mojavensis BZ-13 inoculum, growth was improved over noninoculated plants.In the presence of 1000 mgAg-NPs kg −1, roots, shoots length, leaf number, leaf area and number of berries/plants were greatly decreased by 51, 47, 73, 70 and 79%, respectively compared with control.Following B.mojavensis in the presence of 100 mg Ag-NPs kg−1, the lengths of roots and shoots were increased by 12 and 15%, respectively, over noninoculated treatments ( Figure 3 D).
It is possible that NP-tolerant B. mojavensis might promote root development by modifying some of the intrinsic processes of root growth control,resulting in increased nutrient absorption from soil.Similarly,leaf number ( Figure 3 F), leaf area ( Figure 3 G), and number of berries ( Figure 3 H) were signi ﬁcantly ( p≤0.05) increased by 26, 22, and 19%, respectively, when B.mojavensis was inoculated toW.somnifera (L.) plants cultivated in soils treated with 100 mg Ag-NPs kg −1, compared with plants noninoculated but treated with identical Ag-NP concentrations.Likewise, NPs-tolerant Bacillus cereus LPR2 exhibited a positive e ﬀect on growth, plant length, and physiology in Zea mays (L.) cultivated in soil supplemented with di ﬀerent amounts of Ag-NPs.16 Dry Biomass Accumulation.Here, even in the presence of three dosages of Ag-NPs, biomass accumulation in W.somnifera (L.) plants was generally enhanced after B.mojavensis inoculation.
However, increasing the dosage of NPs resultedin a progressive reduction in dry biomass in the absence of bacterial inoculants. For example, Ag-NPs at 1000 mg kg −1 maximally and signi ﬁcantly reduced the dry biomass accumu- lated in roots (74% reduction) and shoots (65% reduction),compared with controls.In contrast, B.mojavensis inoculation increased the dry biomass of roots and shoots by 30 and 21%, respectively, when applied to soils indigenously contaminatedwith 100 mg Ag-NPs kg −1(Figure 3 E).The NP-tolerant B.mojavensis BZ-13, which was utilized as a bacterial inoculant, also led to a substantial increase in the function of plants, whichmight be related to the production of plant growth regulators.These growth regulators, such as IAA, increase cell elongationFigure 4.Bioinoculation impact of B.

In this study, the increasing concentration of Ag-NPs reduced the SPAD index of W.somnifera (L.) over untreated controls, whereas bacterial-inoculated plants treated with 100 mg Ag-NPs kg−1 growing under NPs stress showed a signi ﬁcant increase in leaf chlorophyll ﬂuorescence parameters. For instance, the SPAD index, photo system e ﬃciency (Fv/Fm), PS II quantum yield (FPSII), photochemical quenching (qP), and non-photo- chemical quenching (NpQ) declined with increasing concen- trations of Ag-NPs.However, inoculation of NP-tolerant B.mojavensis BZ-13 to W.somnifera (L.) plants treated with diﬀerent Ag-NPs amounts modulated all the parameters ( Figure 4A−E).Likewise, leaf pigments accumulating in ashwagandha foliage declined with increas ing Ag-NP concentrations.However, the application of NP-resistant PGPR to soil showed an improvement in leaf pigments.
For example, chl a ( Figure 4F), chl b ( Figure 4 G), total chlorophyll ( Figure 4 panel H), and carotenoid content ( Figure 4 I) of ashwagandha plants were signiﬁcantly ( p≤0.05) increased by 37, 33, 15, and 10%, respectively when B. mojavensis was inoculated to plants raised in soils treated with 25 mg Ag-NPs kg−1over noninoculatedcontrol.The amount of chlorophyll in plants is an important indication of their resistance to Ag-NP stress.The chlorophyll ﬂuorescence process was veri ﬁed to be a responsive approach for recognizing and evaluating alternative ways supported in the photosynthetic machinery.To conclude the NP-resistant B.mojavensis -triggered improvement in the photosynthetic apparatus, Fv/Fm, Fv/F0, qP, and NPQ values were also evaluated in the present study.Ag-NPs present in the soils lowered the values of Fv/Fm, Fv/F0, and NPQ; however, inoculation of NP-resistant B.mojavensis on Ag-NP-treated W.somnifera (L.) plants compensated for these negative e ﬀects.
These ﬁndings suggest that NP-tolerant strains can boost ﬂuorescence pigments and saf eguard the photosynthetic mechanism of plants cultivated in soils contaminated with Ag- NPs. Similar to this observation, the inoculation of NP-resistant PGPR strains Chryseobacterium51andAzotobacter chroococcum52 increased the chlorophyll content of iron-de ﬁcient Lycopersicum esculentum (L.) plants by generating siderophores and other biomolecules.B.mojavensis Modulates Gas Exchange Parameters of W.somnifera (L.) under Ag-NPs.The physiological response of the plant under Ag-NPs stress was revealed by gas exchange characteristics.Like other parameters, Ag-NPs modulate leaf gas exchange attributes, viz., stomatal conductance ( gs), intercel- Figure 5.Gas exchange attributes; intracellular CO2concentration (A), intrinsic water use e ﬃciency (B), photosynthetic rate (C), stomatal conductance (D), transpiration rate (E), and vapor pressure de ﬁcit (F) in B.

For example, following the inoculation of PGPR strain into ashwagandha plants grown in soil even supplemented with 100 mg Ag-NPs kg−1,t h e Ci (Figure 5 A), iWUE ( Figure 5 B), PN ( Figure 5 C), gs ( Figure 5D),E(Figure 5 E), and VpDL ( Figure 5 F) of foliage were substantially ( p≤0.05) improved by 21, 10, 23, 9, 24, and 12%, respectively, over noninoculated controls. Because of its high Ag-NPs tolerance ability, resilience and e ﬃcient rhizosphere colonization, and production of various growth-regulating substances, the B.mojavensis strain enhanced the gas exchange properties of plants by decreasing the Ag-NP-inducedphytotoxicity.Alkaloids and Polyphones in B.mojavensis and Ag-NP- Treated W.somnifera (L.).Plant polyphenols have been shown to be e ﬀective at scavenging free radicals.Many pharmacological eﬀects exhibited by plant-based formulations are attributable to the presence of polyphenols.
Flavonoids and other phenolic compounds of plant origin have been documented as free radical scavengers. Because of their possible therapeutic e ﬀects, dietary polyphenols and alkaloids derived from medicinal plants haverecently attracted the interest of scientists and consumers.Theyacts as powerful antioxidants that help the body ﬁght oxidative stress generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which has been linked to a variety of illnesses.Considering theseproperties, alkaloids and polyphenols content were determined in roots tissues of ashwagandha to assess the e ﬀects of bioinoculants as well as Ag-NPs.Alkaloids and polyphones extracted from root samples of W.somnifera (L.) were signiﬁcantly ( p≤0.05) decreased as the concentrations of Ag- NPs increased from 25 to 1000 mg Ag-NPs kg −1soil.
For example, higher NP rates (1000 mg Ag-NPs kg−1soil) had the maximum adverse e ﬀect where it decreased the total phenols, tannins, ﬂavonoids, and alkaloids content maximally by 57, 77, 61, and 56%, respectively over untreated controls. Contrarily,inoculation of the NP-tolerant B.mojavensis BZ-13 strain resulted in an increase in these contents by detoxifying the Ag- NPs-induced toxicity.For instance, total phenols ( Figure 6 A) and tannins ( Figure 6 B),ﬂavonoids ( Figure 6 C), and alkaloids (Figure 6 D) in bioinoculated plants increased to 25 mg GA equivalents g −1extracts (14%), 6.5 mg tannic acid equivalents g−1extracts (12%), 18 mg quercetin equivalents g−1extracts (11%), and 1.46 mg g−1dry root wt (44%), respectively, when compared with noninoculated and 100 mg Ag-NPs kg−1soil- treated plants.Similarly, NP-tolerant Pseudomonas spp.

As a result, in the majority of plantspecies, the increase in free cellular proteins released in responseto various environmental stressors has been shown to perform avariety of defensive activities. In this study, we discovered a signiﬁcant buildup of proline in ashwagandha plants cultivated in soil polluted with di ﬀerent amounts of Ag-NPs.The maximum proline accumulation (56 μgg −1fw), was recorded at 1000 mg Ag-NPs kg−1soil.On the other hand, following soil inoculation of NP-tolerant PGPR, the proline content droppedsigniﬁcantly.For instance, when B.mojavensis was inoculated with 100 mg Ag-NPs kg −1, the proline concentration decreased by 41% (from 19 to 11.2 μgg−1fw), when compared to noninoculated but NP-treated plants ( Table 2 ).The proline concentration in plants exposed to Ag-NPs was typically reduced when B.mojavensis inoculation was done.
Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a byproduct of lipid peroxidation in cell membranes that may be used to assess the severity of cellmembrane damage.55Ag-NPs stress considerably raised MDA levels in W. somnifera (L.) in this study.The soil inoculation of NP-tolerant B.mojavensis , on the other hand, decreased the MDA buildup in Ag-NPs-stressed plants, suggesting that the bacterial strain can prevent lipid peroxidation.Antioxidant mechanisms have evolved in plants to protect them from the detrimental e ﬀects of oxidative stress.Some of the most frequent ROS scavenging enzymes released by various cell organelles, such as chloroplast and mitochondria, are SOD, POD, CAT, APX, GPX, and GR.
For example, superoxidedismutase (SOD) and catalases (CAT) work collectively tochange [O −O] 2−and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) to molecular oxygen (O 2) and water (H 2O), as well as to decrease OH radicals, while POD serves as an ROS scavenger.56Here, the amount of antioxidant enzymes extracted from root tissues ofashwagandha increased signi ﬁcantly with increasing Ag-NPs concentrations. However, the application of the NP-tolerantPGPR strain lowered the level of antioxidant enzymes.For i n s t a n c e ,C A T ,S O D ,P O X ,A P X ,a n dG Ra c t i v i t i e so f ashwagandha plants maximally and signi ﬁcantly declined by 17, 21, 41, 24, and 32%, respectively when B.mojavensis BZ-13 was used for inoculation in the presence of 50 mg Ag-NPs kg −1 soil compared to plants that were noninoculated but treated with a similar amount of NPs ( Table 2 ).Accumulation of Ag-NPs in Bioinoculated W.
somnifera (L.).Ag-NPs internalization in di ﬀerent organs (roots, shoots, and leaves) of ashwagandha plants increased with increasingconcentrations in sandy clay loam soil. In general, rootsaccumulated the largest concentration of Ag-NPs.As anexample, Ag from 1000 mg Ag-NPs kg −1soil was deposited in roots up to 423 μgg−1followed by shoots (111 μgg−1) and leaves (45 μgg−1)(Figure 7 A−C).W.somnifera (L.) plants grown concurrently with NP-tolerant B.mojavensis BZ-13, on the other hand, showed a substantial reduction in Ag bioaccumulation, with a maximum drop in leaves.Overall, the organ uptake of Ag followed the order: roots > shoots > leaves.B.mojavensis reduced the bioaccumulation of Ag-NPs in roots and shoots by 20% and 25%, respectively, over noninoculated andtreated 50 mg Ag-NPs kg −1soil with control in terms of percent improvement.B.
mojavensis may have used metal-chelating processes other than synthesis of growth regulating substancesto do this, such as siderophore excretion in order to make thenanoparticles biounavailable to plants. Madhaiyan et al.57 showed that metal-tolerant PGPR strains ( Methylobacteriumoryzae and Burkholderia sp.) decreased the phytotoxicity of nanoparticles in L.esculentum (L.) and improved tomato growth in gnotobiotic and pot culture tests, which is similar to thecurrent work.■CONCLUSION The current study emphasized the harmful in ﬂuence of varied levels of Ag-NPs on several biological and physiologicalcharacteristics of Withania somnifera (L.) plants cultivated in a pot-house environment.Because of considerable Ag-NPsaccumulation and translocation, NP-treated W.somnifera (L.) plants demonstrated signi ﬁcantly lower crop performance.
The bacterial inoculant Bacillus mojavensis strain BZ-13, which is NP- resistant, synthesizes indole-3-acetic acid, EPSs, and other plantgrowth-promoting chemicals, and was utilized to circumvent theharmful e ﬀects of Ag-NPs. Inoculation with B.mojavensis enhanced the growth of W.somnifera (L.) crops cocultivated with Ag-NPs in a soil environment by increasing the germinationrates, length, dry biomass, chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, alkaloids, and leaf exchange parameters and lowering the level of proline,MDA, and antioxidant activity, and decreasing Ag-NPsabsorption by roots.The improved W.somnifera (L.) perform- ance indicates that B.mojavensis may possibly colonize and established itself in the plant rhizosphere while sustainingphysiological activity in Ag-NP-contaminated soil.B.mojavensis might serve as an agronomically signi ﬁcant and cost-e ﬀective remediation agent for Ag-NPs polluted soils in terms ofincreasing W.
somnifera (L.) output due to its NPs stress reduction and plant growth enhancing characteristics. In thepresence of lower Ag-NPs doses, B.mojavensis BZ-13 had a maximum positive e ﬀect; therefore, a lower level of NPs would be desirable in future investigations, and applications of higherconcentrations of NPs in agricultural practices should beavoided.Furthermore, more research is needed to determinethe eﬀect of B.mojavensis seed inoculation on soil biological activities under di ﬀerent experimental settings.■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Chemicals (Ag-NPs) Used.Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) were procured from Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt.Ltd.,(Mumbai, India) with an approximate size of 50 −60 nm (TEM analysis revealed they are round and polydispersed) with 99%purity.Phytotoxicity Assessment of Ag-NPs in W.somnifera (L.)

Seeds were cleaned witha solution of 3% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and washed withsterile water. Soft agar (Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd.Mumbai, India)(0.7%) plates amended with di ﬀerent concentrations of Ag-NPs were prepared.Seeds were planted on agar plates and kept atroom temperature (28 ±2°C) for 3 −4 days.Percentage of germination, root and shoot lengths, and plantlet vigor indexwere measured after 4 days.In Vivo Detection of Changes in Mitochondrial Membrane Potential ( ΔΨm) in Ag-NP-Treated Roots Using CLSM.In order to evaluate the cytotoxic behavior of Ag-NPs,ashwagandha seeds were grown on NP-supplemented soft agarplates.
After emergence, seedlings were carefully detached, andAg-NPs-exposed roots were stained with 1.0 g mL −1of rhodamine 123 (Rh-123; a ﬂuorescent dye purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) for qualitative investigation of alterations in theACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Article https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c00262 ACS Omega 2022, 7, 13878 −1389313888 mitochondrial membrane potential ( ΔΨm) and cellular death in roots and examined under a confocal laser scanning microscope(LSM-780, Leica Confocal microscope, Zeiss, Oberkochen,Germany). 27 Bacterial Isolation and Biochemical Characterization.Soil samples for recovery of bacterial isolates were obtained fromvegetable grown areas near Aligarh ’s lock factories (GPS location; 27.937343, 78.141488), where e ﬄuent from industries is utilized to irrigate agricultural ﬁelds.
The top layer was scraped oﬀ, and dirt was collected from at least 12 cm beneath the surface and delivered to the lab in sterile plastic bags (20 −30 cm in diameter). For microbiological testing, soil samples were equally mixed and serially diluted in normal saline solution (NSS).A 100μL aliquot of soil suspension was spread on nutrient agar (NA) (Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd., Mumbai, India) plates and incubatedat 28 ±2°C for 2 −3 days.After the population density was determined, microbial cultures were selected and restreakedthree times on the same medium to get pure cultures.Therecovered soil isolates were stored on the same nutrient mediumuntil it was required.Standard morphological and biochemicaltechniques were used to identify the bacterial strain.58 Bacterial Tolerance to Ag-NPs.To investigate bacterial resistance or sensitivity, cells were treated with di ﬀerent concentrations of Ag-NPs.
In 50 mL of nutrient broth (NB), asingle colony from the plate culture was inoculated in liquidbroth added with 0 −1600 μg Ag-NPs mL −1to determine the CFU count. Under shaking (120 r/min) conditions, NP-untreated/treated cells were incubated (for 72 h at 28 °C).A 0.1 mL culture ﬁltrate was uniformly dispersed on NB plates and allowed to grow at 28 °C.Following incubation, CFUs were calculated after counting the number of viable cells.14 Molecular Identi ﬁcation and Construction of Phylogenetic Tree.Following cultural and biochemical analysis, strain BZ-13 was further molecularly sequenced based on 16S rRNA partialgene sequencing utilizing the universal primers 785F and 907R for species-level molecular identi ﬁcation (refer to section in Supporting Information ).Eﬀect of Ag-NPs on Plant Growth-Promoting Activities (IAA, Siderophore, ACC Deaminase, Ammonia and HCN) of B.mojavensis Strain BZ-13.The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) produced by the Ag-NP-tolerant strain B.
mojavensis BZ-13 was quanti ﬁed using the globally adapted Brick technique. 59Brieﬂy, the strain BZ-13 was grown in Luria − Bertani (LB) broth (Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd.India) supplementedwith a ﬁxed concentration of tryptophan (Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd.Mumbai, India) and treated with various levels of Ag-NPs (0 − 1200 μgm L −1),, and the produced IAA was determined.Furthermore, siderophore production activity was assessed bothqualitatively and quantitatively.Spot inoculation of BZ-13isolates on Ag-NP-supplemented universal chrome azurol S(CAS) agar (Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd.India) plates were tested for siderophore synthesis.60,61Then, the amount of phenolate siderophore (salicylic acid and 2,3-dihydroxy benzoic acid) wasquanti ﬁed by culturing the cells of B.mojavensis in Ag-NP- treated liquid medium.
To check the bacterial synthesis of 1-amino cyclopropane 1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, bacterialcultures were raised in liquid medium treated with increasingconcentrations of Ag-NPs, and the amount of ACC ( μMα- ketobutyrate mg −1protein h−1) was quanti ﬁed according to the methods of Honma and Shimomura,62and Penrose and Glick.63 Synthesis of cyanogenic compound (HCN)64and ammonia65 byB. mojavensis BZ-13 was also assayed by growing the cells in HCN-induction medium and peptone water, respectively.Assessment of Bio ﬁlm Development and Their Associated Traits under Ag-NP Stress.The development of bio ﬁlm by strain BZ-13 in the absence/presence of Ag-NPs was assessed on96-well plates using 1% crystal violet (CV; Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd.Mumbai, India) following the standard procedure of O ’Toole 66 (refer to section in Supporting Information ).
Furthermore, swimming and swarming motilities were assayed.67For this, spot inoculation of freshly produced cells was done on Ag-NPssupplemented at 0.3% and 0.5% (w/v) on NA plates andincubated at 28 ±2°C for 2 days. Following incubation, by zone measurement scale, bacterial motilities were measured as theirswarming diameter and represented in millimeters (mm).In thepresence of Ag-NP stress, the extracellular polymeric substances(EPSs) generated by the BZ-13 strain were quanti ﬁed 68 Furthermore, growing cells in liquid medium supplemented with varying amounts of Ag-NPs were used to measure alginate synthesis69by strain BZ-13 (refer to section in Supporting Information ).Furthermore, the bacterial strain ’s cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) was determined by culturing the cellswith various Ag-NP concentrations and using the microbialadherence to hydrocarbons (MATH) method.70 Impact of Ag-NPs on B.mojavensis BZ-13 Inoculated W.somnifera (L.): Pot-House Study.
Preparation of Bacterial Inoculum, Ag-NPs Treatment, and Soil Application.For inoculum build-up, B. mojavensis BZ-13 was cultured in nutrient broth (NB) at 28 ±2°C for 3 −4 days.The healthy and uniform in sized seeds of W.somnifera were surface sterilized for 3 min with 2% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl; Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd.Mumbai, India) and then washed with sterile water anddried in the shade.Seeds were then immersed in liquid broth ofB.mojavensis (∼1×10 7−8CFU mL−1inoculum suspensions) for 2−3 h using 1% gum acacia powder (Sisco Research Laboratory Pvt.Ltd., Mumbai, India) as an adhesive.The bacteria-treated and control ashwagandha seeds were sown in pot soils treatedwith 0−1000 mg/kg Ag-NPs solution (the NP solution was prepared by mixing the powdered nanoparticles in water).Twodays before planting the seeds, particles were added into theexperimental soils (refer to Supplementary Table S1 ).The pot soils were homogenized after the amendment of Ag-NPs.
Theseeds that had not been coated with bacterial culture weredipped into sterile water and used as a control. Pots weremaintained in an open ﬁeld condition until the crops were matured and harvested.The higher values (500 and 1000 mg kg −1) were used under the assumption that NPs would remain in agricultural soils in excess of normal levels due to unfetteredrelease through home and industrial wastewater over time.Seed Germination, Growth Measurement, Biomass Accu- mulation, Leaf Number and Area, Berry Number.After 8 days of sowing (DAS), the germination percentage was recorded.Biological parameters like root and shoot length, number andarea of leaves, and number of berries were recorded at harvest.After the plants were carefully removed, they were gentlyseparated into roots and shoots, and a measuring scale was usedto measure the lengths.
After adherent soil particles werecarefully removed, multiple washings were done with tap water,and following drying on tissue sheets, the dry matter buildup inroots was evaluated. Root samples were dried in a ventilated oven (York Scienti ﬁc Industries, Pvt.Ltd.India) at 80 °C, and the accumulated biomass was recorded.Further, the leafnumber, leaf area, and berry number per plant were determined.Determination of Photosynthetic Pigments (chl a, b, Total Chlorophyll, and Carotenoid).The formation of chlorophylls (chl a, chl b, total chlorophyll) and carotenoid content in leafACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Article https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c00262 ACS Omega 2022, 7, 13878 −1389313889 tissues of B.mojavensis BZ-13-inoculated and Ag-NPs-treated W.somnifera (L.) plants were extracted and measured using the previously described methods of Arnon71and Kirk and Allen72 (refer to section in Supporting Information ).Measurement of SPAD Index and Chlorophyll Fluores- cence.
The soil plant analysis development (SPAD) index was measured using a SPAD chlorophyll meter (SPAD, MinoltaCamera Co., Osaka, Japan). The SPAD value was taken fromrandomly selected plant samples.73Chlorophyll ﬂuorescence parameters including photosystem II e ﬃciency (Fv/Fm), PS II quantum yield (FPSII), photochemical quenching (qP), andnon-photochemical quenching (NpQ) in bacteria-inoculated and Ag-NP-treated ashwagandha plants were calculated by using a chlorophyll ﬂuorometer.74 Gas Exchange Characteristics of Ag-NP-Treated and Bioinoculated W.somnifera (L.).Gas exchange parameters stomatal conductance ( gs) including the transpiration rate ( E), internal CO 2concentration ( Ci), net photosynthetic rate ( PN), and vapor pressure de ﬁcit (kPa) were measured with a Li-COR 6400 portable photosynthesis system (Li-COR, Lincoln, NE,USA).
After 45 days postsowing (DAS), fully developed leavesfrom each treatment were carefully detached (between 9:00 − 10:00 a.m.) and cleaned, and gas exchange parameters weredetermined. 75 Alkaloid and Polyphenol Contents in Ag-NP-Treated and Bioinoculated W.somnifera.For extraction and measurement of withaferin-A (alkaloid content) in root tissues, Ag-NP-treatedand bioinoculated ashwagandha plants were detached.Themethod of extraction and determination was adopted aspreviously described by Lin et al.76The total phenolics content in roots was measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu technique77using 100μL of the plant extract.A total of 900 μL of methanol was used to dilute the extract 10 times.Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (0.5mL) was added, and the mixture was thoroughly mixed.Then,1.0 mL of saturated disodium carbonate (Na 2CO 3; Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd., Mumbai, India) was added after 6 min.
The reaction mixture was allowed to settle for at least 2 −3 h after the total volume was adjusted to 7.5 mL using DDW. The absorbancewas measured at 680 nm against a blank solution after 2 −3h .Using a gallic acid (200 −1000 g) calibration curve, the total phenol content was reported as mg of gallic acid equivalents(GAE)/g of extract.The total ﬂavonoid concentration was determined using the aluminum chloride colorimetric test, asdescribed by Kim et al.78For quanti ﬁcation, in a test tube, 100 μL of the plant extract was diluted with 0.9 mL.Using DDW, the volume was reduced to 4 mL.Then, 300 μLo f5 %N a2NO3was added to this and left for 5 min (for detailed methodology, referto the section in Supporting Information ).In order to determine total tannins accumulated in B.mojavensis inoculated and Ag- NP-treated roots of ashwagandha plants, the method of Folin-Denis was applied.
79For extraction, 900 μL of methanol was added to 100 μL of extract, and the ﬁnal volume of solution was made to 7.5 mL by adding DDW. After this, 0.5 mL of Folin-Denis reagent was added along with 1.0 mL of saturatedNa 2CO 3.Using DDW, total volume was adjusted to 10 mL.After the reaction mixture was allowed to sit for a couple of hours, the absorbance was measured at 680 nm against a blank solution.Using a tannic acid (20 −100 g) calibration curve, the quantity of tannins was quanti ﬁed as mg of tannic acid equivalents/gram of extract.Proline, MDA, and Antioxidant Enzymes Determination in Ag-NP-Treated and Bioinoculated Plants.The method of Bates et al.80was applied to determine proline contentaccumulated in root tissues of B.mojavensis and Ag-NPs-treated ashwagandha plants.For quanti ﬁcation, 50 mg of root samples was extracted in sulfosalicylic acid (Sisco Research LaboratoryPvt.
Ltd., Mumbai, India) and combined with the same quantityof glacial acetic acid (Sisco Research Laboratory Pvt. Ltd.,Mumbai, India) and ninhydrin solutions (Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd., Mumbai, India).A total of 5.0 mL of toluene was added to the sample after it was heated to 100 °C.Using a spectrophotometer (UV−visible spectrophotometer UV-2450, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), the aspired layer ’s absorbance was measured at 528 nm.The previously used methods of Shahid et al.81−85and Khan et al.86was employed to determine lipid peroxidation as measured by the MDA content.For the assay, roots were homogenized in 0.1% trichloroacetic acid (TCA; Sisco ResearchLaboratory Pvt.Ltd., Mumbai, India) and centrifuged for 15 minat 10000 g.The supernatant was combined with a 20% TCA solution containing 0.5% thiobarbituric acid (TBA; SiscoResearch Laboratory Pvt.Ltd., Mumbai, India).Then, thesolution was warmed for 30 min at 95 °C.The supernatant was centrifuged at 1000 gfor 15 min at 4 °C after chilling.
The mixture ’s absorbance was measured at 532 nm. 87 For determination of antioxidant enzymes like catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD),roots (0.5 g) were homogenized in a 50 mM phosphate bu ﬀer (pH = 7.0) of 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd., Mumbai, India).The mixture solutions were homogenized(at 15000 gfor 10 min and at 4 °C), and the obtained ﬁltrate was used for determination of antioxidant enzymes.The enzyme extract (0.1 mL) was combined in a reaction mixture ofpyrogallol, phosphate bu ﬀer (pH = 6.8), and 1% H 2O2to determine the peroxidase (POX) activity.A UV −visible spectrophotometer was used to calculate absorbance at 420nm.88For the catalase (CAT) estimation, phosphate bu ﬀer (pH = 6.8), 0.1 M hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2; Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd., Mumbai, India), and enzyme extract (100 μL) were mixed together.89Beauchamp and Fridovich ’s technique90was used to determine the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity.
The reaction combination needed 50 mM phosphate bu ﬀer (pH = 7.8), 20 μM ribo ﬂavin (Hi-Media Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India), 75 mM nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT; Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd., Mumbai,India), 13 mM methionine (Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd., Mumbai,India), and 0.1 mM ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA;Hi-Media Pvt.Ltd., Mumbai, India).A UV −visible spectropho- tometer was used to measure absorbance at 560 nm after thecombination was illuminated for 10 min in two ﬂuorescent light tubes.Uptake of Ag-NPs in B.mojavensis-Inoculated W.somnifera (L.) Plants.The accumulation of Ag-NPs was measured at the harvest of ashwagandha crops.W.somnifera (L.) plants were divided into three parts: roots, shoots, andleaves, when detached from pots cultivated with varying rates ofAg-NPs.Plant tissues were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C until they reached a consistent weight and then were crushed into a ﬁne powder.Acid digestion was done in 10 mL of nitric acid and perchloric acid (Sisco Research Laboratory Pvt.
Ltd., Mumbai,India) (at a ratio of 4:1) using 1.0 g of dried powder. Theremaining solution was ﬁltered using Whatman No.2 ﬁlter paper after complete digestion, and the volume was increased to 100mL using DDW.Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry(ICP-MS; PerkinElmer ’s NexION ICP) was used to determine the amount of Ag in the sample.For calibration, we employedblank and varied concentrations of standard solutions madefrom 1000 mg L −1stock.ACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Article https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c00262 ACS Omega 2022, 7, 13878 −1389313890 Statistical Analysis.Each ashwagandha crop experimental treatment was reproduced at least ﬁve times.Because the data were homogeneous, the data from each crop were combined andstatistically evaluated using one-way and two-way analysis ofvariance (ANOVA) with the statistical program Minitab 17.0.For two variables (PGPR inoculation and Ag-NP dosage), a two-way ANOVA was used.
For each measured parameter, the datain the ﬁgures are displayed as mean ±SD ( n= 5). ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT *sıSupporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.2c00262 .Details on how to use 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify rhizobacterial strains, detailed methodologies forbioﬁlm assessment, alginate production, and total ﬂavonoid content.Table S1 presenting the physicochem- ical properties of experimental soil.
