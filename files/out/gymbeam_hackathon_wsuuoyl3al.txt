The pre-rigor chicken breast muscles were de-boned 10 min post-mortem and salte d within 25 min post-mortem.
An increase in pre-rigor salting level led to the formation of high ultimate pH of chicken breast mu scles at post-mortem 24 h. The addition of minimum of 2% NaCl significantly improved water holding capacity, cooking loss, protein solub ility, and hardness when compared to the non-salting chicken breast muscle ( p<0.05).On the other hand, the increase in pre-rigor salting level caused the inhibition of myofibrillar protein degradation and the acceleration of lipid oxidation.However, the difference in N aCl con- centration between 3% and 4% had no great differences in the results of physicochemical and textural properties due to pre-rigo r salting effects ( p>0.05).Therefore, our study certified the pre-rigor salting effect of chicken breast muscle salted with 2% NaCl when compared to post-rigor muscle salted with equal NaCl concentration, and suggests that the 2% NaCl concentration is minimally required to ensure the definite pre-rigor salting effect on chicken breast muscle.
Keywords: chicken breast, post-mortem, pre-rigor salting, physicochemical properties, rigor-mortis Received November 1, 2014; Revised March 31, 2015; Accepted March 31, 2015 Introduction Pre-rigor muscle, which signifies the biochemical mus- cle state before rigor-mortis, is generally obtained fromhot boning or accelerated processing techniques. The pre-rigor muscle has been known to have several economicbenefits, including reduction in labor and storage facilityand superior processing quality due to the higher level of adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) content and pH value when compared to post-rigor muscle (Pisula and Tyburcy,1996).With the passage of time after slaughter, unfortu-nately, the pre-rigor muscle starts to lose functional prop-erties due to depletion of ATP and a decrease in pH withthe accumulation of lactic acid by anaerobic glycolysis(Hamm, 1977; Pisula and Tyburcy, 1996).
For these reasons, previous studies have been mainly focused on the maintenance and improvement of thefunctional properties of the pre-rigor muscle. Especially, it is well known that the addition of salt into the pre-rigor muscle, which is called as “pre-rigor salting”, improved the extraction of myofibrillar proteins, such as myosinheavy chain and actin (Abu-Bakar et al., 1989; Bernthal et al ., 1989; Bernthal et al ., 1991).Coon et al .(1983) suggested that the pre-rigor salting caused the high ulti-mate pH values, similar to living body, due to rapid pas- sage of rigor-mortis, as well as the reported principle effect of salt.The improved water holding capacity andprotein solubility resulted from the extended space bydisassociation of myofibrillar proteins under the high pHvalue (Hamm, 1977).
Thus, numerous studies have exam-ined the pre-rigor salting effect on the processing qualityand determining the optimal salt level, which can lead to the pre-rigor salting effect, in mammalian species, such as mainly beef and pork (Hamm, 1981; Puolanne and Ter-rell, 1983). Recently, modern consumers interested in their health have preferred to consume white muscle, which haslower fat and higher protein contents compared to red muscle (Jones, 1992).The consumption of chicken meat, *Corresponding author: Cheon Jei Kim, Department of Food Sci- ence and Biotechnology of Animal Resources, Konkuk Univer- sity, Seoul 05029, Korea.Tel: +82-2-450-3684, Fax: +82-2-444-6695, E-mail: kimcj@konkuk.ac.krARTICLE 578 Korean J.Food Sci.An., Vol.35, No.5 (2015) which is a typical white muscle, is constantly increasing all over the world.According to a report of Korea PoultryAssociation (2014), per capita consumption of chickenmeat in Korea has risen steadily from 2003 (7.9 kg) to2012 (11.5 kg).
Nevertheless, consumption patterns ofchicken meat were too simple and were mainly limited to mostly whole meat, meat cuts, nuggets, and patties. Choi et al.(2009) indicated that the reason for the limitation was related to the inadequate processing quality ofchicken compared to those of beef and pork.To enhancethe processing quality of chicken meat, thus, the applica-tion of pre-rigor salting technique to chicken muscle car- ried an important meaning.Previously, Karakaya et al .(2005) reported the excellent cooking yield of pre-rigorchicken muscle and suggested its applicability to pre-rigor salted chicken.Choi et al.(2009) reported that pre- rigor salted chicken breast had a higher water holdingcapacity and a lower cooking loss than the post-rigorsalted chicken breast.
However, there is a lack of research on the determination of minimal salt concentration, which can ensure the pre-rigor salting effect on chicken muscle,and the investigation on the processing characteristics ofchicken muscles by the difference in added salt levels. Therefore, the objective of this study was to (1) evalu- ate the effect of pre-rigor salting levels in terms of the sodium chloride (0-4% NaCl) and (2) determine the effect of pre-/post-rigor salting with 2% NaCl on physic-ochemical and textural properties of chicken breast mus-cles.Materials and Methods Preparation of raw materialsA total of 60 broilers (Arbor Acre Broiler, 5 wk of age and approximately 1.6-1.8 kg live weight) were obtainedfrom a local poultry processor and transported to the meatscience laboratory of Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.The birds were slaughtered in accordance with the poul- try slaughter procedure described by Alvarado and Sams (2000).
Feed and water were allowed until 12 h and 2 hprior to slaughter, respectively. The birds were stunnedelectrically at 50 V for 10 s and killed by bleeding from asingle unilateral neck for approximately 3 min.Afterbleeding and evisceration, chicken breast muscles ( Mus- culus pectoralis major ) from 50 broilers were obtained within 10 min after slaughter.And then, the obtainedmuscles were ground through an 8 mm plate within 20min post-mortem and divide into five portions.For post-rigor treatments, chicken breast muscles were obtainedfrom remained 10 broilers 24 h after slaughter.Sodium chloride (NaCl) of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4% (w/w, based on sam-ple weight) was added to each portion, and then, the pre-rigor salted chicken breast muscles were mixed withblender for 3 min.Also, the post-rigor chicken breastmuscle was salted with 2% NaCl after grinding (8 mm).Total time required was under 25 min until pre-rigor salt- ing processing.
The salted chicken breast muscles wereindividually vacuum-packaged into nylon/polyethylenebags and refrigerated at 4ºC for 24 h until analysis. pH measurements The pH values of sample were determined with a pH meter (Model 340, Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Switzerland)at post-mortem 25 min, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h.The pH val-ues of samples were measured by blending a 5 g samplewith 20 mL distilled water for 60 s in a homogenizer at8,000 rpm (Ultra-Turrax SK15, Janke & Kunkel, Ger-many).Water holding capacity (WHC) WHC was determined in triplicate by filter paper pressed method (Grau and Hamm, 1953).Sample of 0.3 gwas weighed onto a Whatman No.2 filter paper andpressed between two plexiglass plate for 3 min.The areas of pressed water and sample were measured using planimeter (Type KP-21, Koizumi, Japan).
WHC was cal-culated as follows; WHC (%) = area of pressed sample / area of pressed water × 100 Cooking loss All samples stuffed into each centrifugal tube (approxi- mately 50 g) and were cooked in a constant-temperaturewater bath (75°C, 30 min). The cooked samples werecooled to room temperature for 6 h.After cooling, thecooked samples were reweighed.Cooking loss was deter- mined by calculating the weight differences before and after cooking as follows.Cooking loss (%) = [(weight of raw sample (g) − weight of cooked sample (g)) / weight of raw sample (g)]× 100 Protein solubility The solubility of the salt soluble (myofibrillar) protein was determined following the modification of proceduresdescribed by Saffle and Galbreath (1964).A 5 g sample Effect of Pre-rigor Salting on Chicken Breast 579 was blended with 50 mL 3% sodium chloride solution at 14,000 rpm for 2 min using homogenizer (AM-7, Nihon-seiki Kaisha, Japan).The mixture was centrifuged at3,000 g for 15 min.
The protein concentration of superna- tant was determined using the biuret method (Gornall et al., 1949) and using bovine serum albumin (Sigma Che- mical Co., USA). Myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI) Myofibrils was obtained according to the method of Olson et al.(1976) using MFI buffer (20 mM K 2HPO4/ KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaN3).The myofibrils were suspended in MFI buffer.An aliquot of myofibril suspension was diluted with the MFIbuffer to 0.5 mg/mL protein concentration and the absor-bance of this suspension measured at 540 nm.MFI valueswere recorded as absorbance units per 0.5 mg/mL myo-fibril protein concentration multiplied by 200.Texture (hardness) TPA was performed at room temperature with a texture analyzer (TA-XT2 i, Stable Micro Systems, England).Cooked meat samples (2.5 cm in height, 2.0 cm in diam-eter) were taken from the central portion of each meat.Prior to analysis, samples were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature (20 oC, 3 h).
The conditions of texture analysis were as follows: pre-test speed 2.0 mm/s, post-test speed 5.0 mm/s, maximum load 2 kg, head speed 2.0mm/s, distance 8.0 mm, force 5 g. The calculation ofhardness was obtained by graphing a curve using forceand time plots.2-Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value Lipid oxidation was assessed in triplicate by TBA method of Tarladgis et al.(1960) with minor modifica- tions.A 10 g sample was blended with 50 mL distilledwater for 2 min and then transferred to a distillation tube.The cup used for blending was washed with an additional 47.5 mL of distilled water, which was added to the same distillation flask with 2.5 mL 4 N HCl and a few drops ofan antifoam agent (KMK-73, Shin-Etsu Silicone Co.,Ltd., Korea).The mixture was distilled and 50 mL distil-late was collected.5 mL of 0.02 M 2-Thiobarbituric acidin 90% acetic acid (TBA reagent) was added to test tube containing 5 mL of the distillate and mixed well.
The tubes were capped and heated in a boiling water bath for30 min to develop the chromogen and cooled to roomtemperature. The absorbance was measured at 538 nm,against a blank prepared with 5 mL distilled water and 5mL TBA-reagent, using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Optizen 2120 UV plus, Mecasys Co., Ltd., Korea).TheTBA values were calculated as mg MDA/kg meat.TBA (MDA mg/kg) = (optical density of sample − optical density of blank) × 7.8 Statistical analysis All tests were done at least three times for each experi- mental condition and mean values were reported.One-way ANOV A was employed to determine the signifi-cance of main effect (pre-rigor salting level), and signifi- cance of difference between means of post-rigor 2% and pre-rigor 2% treatments ( t-test) was determined using the SAS statistical package (2008).Duncan’s multiple rangetest ( p<0.05) was used to determine differences between treatment means.
The procedure CORR of the SAS pack-age was used to calculate correlations between the pre-rigor salting level and the measurements. Results and Discussion Changes in pH valueGenerally, the decline in pH of meat after slaughter occurs due to the accumulation of lactic acid formed from the glycogen under anaerobic glycolysis (Hamm, 1977).The change in the pH value of pre-rigor chicken breastmuscle salted with various NaCl levels after post-mortemtwenty-four hours is shown in Fig.1.The initial pH valueof chicken breast at fifteen minutes after slaughter was6.48, and then, the pH values of all treatments rapidly decreased until post-mortem two hours.The pH value of post-rigor 2% treatment was 5.85 (data not shown).According to Jones (1992), poultry muscle quicklyreached the rigor-mortis compared to the mammalian spe-cies and began at about post-mortem one hour.Similar toour study, Yu et al .
(2009) reported that hot-boned chicken breast muscle reached the ultimate pH within post-mortem three hours. After pre-rigor salting, the ulti- mate pH value of pre-rigor chicken breast muscle wasgradually affected by the added amount of NaCl.The pre-rigor chicken breast muscle salted with 4% NaCl showedthe highest ultimate pH value (6.05), but the pH value ofnon-salting chicken breast muscle was 5.78.Bernthal et al.(1989) reported that the changes in pH values of hot- boned ground beef was linearly related to the addedamount of NaCl.Coon et al .(1983) indicated that the addition of NaCl on pre-rigor muscle could cause thehigh ultimate pH due to the speeding passage of rigor- 580 Korean J.Food Sci.An., Vol.35, No.5 (2015) mortis.
Dalrymple and Hamm (1974) suggested that the inactivation of enzymes associated with glycolysis underhigh ionic strength and low pH, such as phosphorylaseand phosphofructokinase, was one of the main reasons for the high ultimate pH of the pre-rigor salted muscle. Thus, an increase in ultimate pH of pre-rigor saltedchicken breast muscle might be associated with the inac-tivation of glycolytic enzymes due to an increase in ionicstrength.Water holding capacity (WHC) and cooking loss WHC of meat, which implies the ability to retain mois- ture within the internal muscle structure, in meat process-ing, is directly related to the release of moisture duringmanufacturing and thermal processing.In this respect, thepre-rigor salting has been recognized as one of the effec-tive methods to maintain the WHC and cooking yield of pre-rigor muscle (Pisula and Tyburcy, 1996).The effect of pre-rigor salting level on WHC of chicken breast mus-cles at post-mortem twenty-four hours is shown in Fig.
2.WHC of pre-rigor chicken breast muscles increased withincreasing added amounts of NaCl whereas the cookingloss decreased. However, the pre-rigor chicken breast muscle salted with 1% NaCl exhibited similar WHC and cooking loss when compared to non-salting chickenbreast muscle ( p>0.05).In addition, pre-rigor 2% NaCl treatment had a significantly higher water holding capac-ity (p<0.01) and lower cooking loss ( p<0.001) than post-rigor 2% treatment.Bernthal et al.(1989) reported that the highest level of salting concentration (4% NaCl) resulted in an excellent pre-rigor salting effect on ground beef and suggested that, minimally, 2% NaCl was neededto expect the pre-rigor salting effect.Pisula and Tyburcy(1996) reported that the excellent WHC of pre-rigorsalted muscles results from its high pH value and ATPcontent.
According to Boles and Swan (1997), the increase in salting level could influence the net charge of muscle proteins, which contributed to the changes in thesolubility of muscle proteins. In this study, the addition ofNaCl at a minimum of 2% began to function on theimprovement of WHC of pre-rigor chicken breast mus-cles, resulting in the reduction in cooking loss.Protein solubility, myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI), and textureThe effect of pre-rigor salting level on protein solubil- ity, MFI, and texture of chicken breast muscles at post-mortem twenty-four hours is shown in Table 1.Asexpected, the highest protein solubility was observed for the pre-rigor chicken breast muscle salted with 4%.How- ever, there was no significant difference in the proteinsolubility between chicken breast muscles salted with 3%and 4% NaCl ( p>0.05).The pre-rigor 1% treatment showed similar protein solubility to post-rigor 2% treat- Fig.1.

(1995) reported that the myofibrillar protein content of chicken breast (12.57%) was lower than that ofbeef (12.65%). Moreover, McIntosh (1967) noted that thechicken muscle showed the low protein extractability dur-ing all times of post-mortem when compared to beef and pork.For these reasons, thus, the difference in minimum NaCl concentration, which can ensure the pre-rigor salt-ing effect, might be associated with the myofibrillar pro-tein content and the protein extractability of chickenbreast muscle.Generally, the myofibrillar protein degradation by endogenous proteases occurred on Z-disc in muscle after slaughter, and the degree of the degradation could bemeasured by MFI method (Olson and Parrish, 1977).Inaddition, MFI value was an important factor determiningmeat tenderness, along with sarcomere length, ionicstrength, and animal species (Koohmaraie, 1994).
Thepre-rigor chicken breast muscle salted with 2% NaCl showed lower MFI value than post-rigor chicken breast muscle salted with 2% NaCl. Among pre-rigor treat-ments, the non-salting chicken breast muscle had a higherMFI value than all pre-rigor salted chicken breast mus-cles ( p<0.05), and an increase in added amounts of NaCl led to a decreased MFI value.Sárraga et al .(1989) reported that the addition of NaCl suppressed the activity of endogenous proteases, such as calcium activated pro-teases and cathepsin.Thus, the decreasing MFI valuewith increasing added amount of NaCl could result fromthe inactivation of endogenous proteases due to anincrease in ionic strength.As mentioned above, the results of protein solubility and MFI values, which is responsible for the texturalproperties of meat and meat product, have shown diverseresults.
In terms of the hardness, an increase in pre-rigor salting level increased hardness of pre-rigor chicken breast muscles after thermal processing, and pre-rigor 2%treatment had a significantly higher hardness than post-rigor 2% treatment. The hardness of the pre-rigor chickenbreast muscle salted with 4% NaCl (7.45 kg) was about1.65 times compared to that of non-salting chicken breast muscle (4.51 kg).Thus, this result suggested that an increase in hardness due to pre-rigor salting could berelated to both protein solubility and MFI value.2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value Lipid oxidation, along with microbiological safety, is one of the major factors affecting the quality characteris- tics of meat and meat product during storage period.Chicken meat, which has high polyunsaturated fatty acidscontent compared to other animal species, is very sensi-tive to lipid oxidation (Rhee et al., 1996).
In this study, an increase in the added amount of NaCl obviously causedthe lipid oxidation of chicken breast muscles (Fig. 3).A minimum addition of 2% NaCl showed significantly increased TBA value compared to non-salting treatment(p<0.05); however, there was no significant difference in TBA values between 3% and 4% treatments (0.39-0.40mg MDA/kg meat) ( p>0.05).In addition, pre-rigor 2% treatment showed a significantly higher TBA value than post-rigor 2% treatment ( p<0.05).According to Torres et al.(1988), the addition of more than 0.5% could promote the lipid oxidation of pre-rigor ground beef during stor-age.Lee et al.(1997) indicated that the addition of NaCl released the iron ion from the myoglobin, consequentlyTable 1.

(1996) sug- gested that frozen raw beef and pork meats showed higher TBA value than chicken meat because beef and pork meats contained high heme iron content. Thus, thereason why the lipid oxidation of pre-rigor salted chickenmuscle was accelerated under high NaCl concentration,in comparison with beef muscle, could be greatly associ-ated with the content of heme pigments.In the case of the production of meat product, Rhee et al.(1988) reported that the restructured nugget prepared with pre-rigor saltedpork showed the acceleration of lipid oxidation whencompared to that made with post-rigor salted pork.Evenif the pre-rigor salting caused the acceleration of pre-rigorchicken breast muscles in our study, considering the con-sumption threshold (1.0 mg MDA/kg meat) related to lipid rancidity (Suh, 1984), it would be desirable that the pre-rigor salted chicken breast muscle was used asquickly as possible.
Correlation between pre-rigor salting level and measurements The coefficients of correlation for pre-rigor chicken breast muscle salted with various NaCl concentrations arepresented in Fig. 4.The relationships between pre-rigorsalting level and ultimate pH value ( p<0.01, r=0.62), WHC (p<0.001, r=0.98), protein solubility ( p<0.01, r=0.86),hardness ( p<0.01, r=0.88), and TBA value ( p<0.01, r= 0.84) were positively significant whereas the relation-ships between pre-rigor salting level and cooking loss(p<0.001, r=-0.94) and MFI ( p<0.01, r=-0.82) were nega- tively significant.Thus, this result showed that the NaClconcentration (0-4%) had a slightly linear relationship with the physicochemical and textural properties of pre- rigor chicken breast muscles.Conclusion The increase in pre-rigor salting level contributed to the formation of high ultimate pH of chicken breast muscles at post-mortem twenty-four hours.
In addition, the signif- icant pre-rigor salting effect, which could improve and/ormaintain the WHC, cooking loss, protein solubility, andhardness, was observed for the chicken breast musclesalted with at least 2% NaCl, and this study certified thepre-rigor salting effect when compared to post-rigor mus- cle at equal salting concentration (2% NaCl). On the other hand, the increase in pre-rigor salting level causedthe inhibition of myofibrillar protein degradation and theacceleration of lipid oxidation.However, the difference inNaCl concentration between 3% and 4% had no great Fig.3.2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values of pre-rigor chicken breast muscles salted with various sodium chloride (NaCl) levels at post-mortem 24 h.a-cMeans in the sam- ples with different letters (among pre-rigor treatments) are significantly different ( p<0.05).Asterisk in bars means the significance of t-test between post-rigor 2% and pre-rigo r 2%.* p<0.05.Fig.4.
