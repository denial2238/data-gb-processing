k“_here are scarce in vitrostudies indicating the basic mechanisms of why platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is useful in the clinical management of dogs with naturally occurring OA. Methods.Cartilage and synovial membrane explants from six dogs were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cultured for 48h with platelet-poor gel supernatant (PPGS) and platelet-rich gel supernatant (PRGS)at concentrationsof 25 and50%,respectively.k“_hetissue explants challenged with LPS were cocultured over 48hand culturemedia weresampledat1and48hforthedeterminationofIL-1β,IL-10,hyaluronan,TGF-β1, andPDGF-BB byELISA.Results.IL-1β concentrations were signiﬁcantly higher in tissue explant groups cultured for 48h with PRGS at 50% and with PPGS at 25% when compared to the remaining experimental groups at any time.IL-10 and HA presented similar con-centrations in all evaluated groups at any time.
TGF-β1 and PDGF-BB presented higher concentrations in the culture media of tissue explants cultured with PPGS and PRGS at 50%, which diminished with time. Conclusions.Both PPGS and PRGS at both concentrationsshowedalimitedbiologicaleﬀectoncartilageandsynovialmembraneexplantsincoculturewithLPS.EvenPPGSat 25% and PRGS at 50% exhibited proinﬂammatory eﬀects on these tissues at 48h.1.Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most frequent pan-articular disease observed in human beings and animals such as dogs[1].k“_his inﬂammatory/degenerative condition ischaracterized by progressive articular cartilage damage,subchondral bone remodeling, synovitis, and intra- andperi-articular soft tissue deterioration, which is sometimesaccompanied by ligament rupture that induces additionalmechanical damage secondary to joint instability [2, 3].
OA canappearas a primary(spontaneous)diseaseor be associated with both ligament lassitude or rupture, thereby producingjoint instabilityand jointincongruence [4].As in humans, OA in dogs is increasing dramatically due to theincreased life expectancy of pets worldwide. Studiesconducted in the UK and USA have found that OA couldaﬀectbetween6.6and20%ofdogsover1yearofage[1,5,6],whichcouldrepresentapopulationof15milliondogsinthe USA alone [3].k“_he main clinical signs related to OA include joint ef- fusion and lameness, which are indicative of pain.k“_his condition produces the loss of joint function and reducespatients’ quality of life.k“_hus, the therapeutic goal for themanagement of this disease is centered on controlling painand avoiding progressive joint deterioration [3, 4].
Regardless of the advances in knowledge of OA path- ophysiology [2], this disease continues to be managed withdiverse symptomatic treatments, such as the systemic orintra-articular injection of analgesics and anti-inﬂamma- tories, oral nutraceuticals accompanied by physical therapy, and lifestyle changes that could include exercise restrictionand weight loss [3, 7]. However, while this disease couldprogressinsomecases,withsurgicaljointreplacementbeinga potential ﬁnal option, euthanasia also appears as the mostHindawi Veterinary Medicine International Volume 2022, Article ID 3377680, 10 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/3377680 drastic decision for many owners due to budget restrictions or concerns related to their dog’s quality of life [3].Regenerative medicine is emerging as a new therapeutic approach aimed—among the better cases—to restore thestructure and function of organs or tissue damaged bytrauma, inﬂammation, or a degenerative process.
k“_here are several encouraging regenerative therapies for the clinical management of OA in dogs, such as those using stem cells[8–12] and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) [13–17]. However,from economic and technical perspectives, PRP could be amore universal and aﬀordable orthobiologic than stem celltherapy for OA management—especially in third worldcountries with limited access to stem cell technology.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is a scarcity ofpublishedstudiesindicatingthebasicmechanismsbehindwhy PRP is useful in the clinical management of dogs withnaturallyoccurringOA.Inlinewiththis,we presentastudy that evaluated the anti-inﬂammatory and anabolic eﬀects of two autologous hemocomponents (platelet-rich gel super-natant(PRGS)andplatelet-poorgelsupernatant(PPGS))inanin vitrosystem of canine osteoarthritis, which included the coculture of canine cartilage and synovial membraneexplantschallengedwithlipopolysaccharide(LPS).k“_hus,wemeasured and compared the released concentrations of theanti-inﬂammatory and anabolic growth factors trans-forming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β 1) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB, a proinﬂammatory cytokine,and interleukin 1 (IL-1)), as well as the anti-inﬂammatorymediatorIL-10andtheanabolicindicatorhyaluronan(HA), in the culture media of an OA system cultured with au- tologousPRGSandPPGSconcentrations(25and50%)over48h.
We hypothesized that PRGS at any concentrationwoulddiminishthereleaseofIL-1andincreasethereleaseofIL-10 and HA. 2.Materials and Methods k“_his study was approved by the Committee for AnimalExperimentation of the authors’ institution.k“_he study wasconducted according to international welfare guidelines foranimal experimentation and the panel on euthanasia of theAVMA [18], while also considering the rule in theColombian act for dangerous dogs [19].2.1.Animals.k“_he biological material (blood, cartilage, and synovial membrane) used in this study was obtained from six clinically healthy dogs (four females and two males)between 1.5 and 3.5 years old, with a mean weight of24.2±2.87kg.According to Colombian law, all included animals were considered dangerous dogs that were aban-doned by their owners or seized.k“_he animals were sedated with xylazine and butorphanol and then received an in- travenous overdose of sodium pentobarbital [18].2.2.Blood Collection and Hemocomponent Processing.
Whole blood was collected from each sedated dog beforeeuthanasia. Brieﬂy, the blood was aseptically obtained viajugular venipuncture and deposited in a 450mL transfusionbag containingCPDA-1asan anticoagulant.A 10mLbloodsample was used to perform automated blood cell counts.2.2.1.Platelet-Rich Plasma and Plasma Procurement.First, 10mL blood samples were aseptically deposited in15mL sterile Falcon tubes.k“_hen, ﬁve 10mL Falcon tubeswere used for PRP processing and the ﬁve additional tubeswereusedforPPPprocurement.k“_heleftoverbloodwasusedfor other experiments unrelated to this research or clinicalpurposesintheVeterinaryMedicalTeachingHospitaloftheauthors.PRP was obtained by a simple spinning of the Falcon tubes at 191g for 6min.After centrifuging each blood tube,there was a diﬀerentiation between the packed cell volume (∼40%) and plasma (∼60%).
A sterile pipette was then in- troduced near the buﬀy coat and 50% of the plasma wasgently aspirated to avoid the over-aspiration (contamina-tion) of red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells(WBCs)—especially polymorphonuclear cells. k“_he resultingplasma fraction (∼ 15mL) was considered PRP, which was then activated with calcium gluconate over 3h at 37 °C.k“_hereafter,thePRGSwasstoredat −80°Cforlateruseinthe in vitro explant tissue coculture and for the basal deter-mination of IL-1β, IL-10, HA, TGF-β 1, and PDGF-BB.PPP was obtained by centrifuging an additional ﬁve Falcon tubes at 3500g for 10min.k“_he 50% top plasmafraction was used for the experiment.k“_his fraction wasactivated with calcium gluconate over 3h at 37 °C to obtain platelet-poor gel supernatant (PPGS), which was managedsimilarly to PRGS.2.3.Cartilage and Synovial Membrane Harvesting.After euthanasia,theentirefemoral-tibialregionfrombothlegsof each dog was aseptically prepared for joint tissue harvest.
After surgical stiﬂe exposition, several cartilage slices freefromtheircalciﬁedregionwereobtainedwithascalpelfromlateral and medial condyles. Furthermore, the surroundingcondyle joint capsule was dissected for obtaining synovialmembrane explants (SMEs).Cartilage explants (CEs) andSMEswereobtainedbyusinga4mmcircularbiopsypunch.Notably, SMEs were gently released from the circular jointcapsuleexplantspreviouslyobtainedwiththebiopsypunch.2.4.In vitro Tissue Explant Coculture and Study Design.
BoththeCEs(n �12)andSMEs(n �12)fromeachdogwere rinsed with phosphate-buﬀered saline solution and stabi-lized in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle medium (DMEM) (highglucose, 4500mg/L) with L-glutamine and sodium bicar-bonate free from sodium pyruvate (DMEM, Lonza GroupLtd, Basel, Switzerland) and supplemented with strepto-mycin (100 μg/mL) and penicillin (100 μg/mL) without the additionofserum.Cultureswereincubatedina5%CO 2and water-saturated atmosphere for 24h and then replaced withfreshculturemedia.Atthistimepoint,apartoftheCEsandSMEs was challenged with 100ng/mL of LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) to induce the inﬂammatory/2 VeterinaryMedicineInternational catabolic damage of these tissues, as described in other studies [20, 21].
Six experimental groups (with two CEs and two SMEs eachincoculture)wereincluded.Coculturedtissueexplantswere performed in six-well plates (Corning, Costar, TC-Treated Multiple Well Plates, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) with a total volume of 3mL per well, considering theﬁnalconcentrationofthePRGSandPPGSassayedintheculture media. k“_he study design included the evaluation oftwo cocultured tissue explant control groups (one with theaddition of LPS and one without LPS) without the additionof any hemoderivatives, as well as four cocultured tissueexplant LPS-challenged groups cultured with PRGS andPPGSattwoconcentrations(25and50%).Alltissueexplantgroups were cocultured over 48h.Samples of culture media(0.5mL) were obtained at 1h and 48h.k“_hese samples wereobtained, aliquoted, and frozen at −80 °C for subsequent determinationofthebiomolecules.Figure1showsthestudydesign and methodology.2.5.Cytokine,Hyaluronan,andGrowthFactorMeasurement.
IL-1β, IL-10, HA, TGF-β 1, and PDGF-BB concentrations were measured in PRGS, PPGS, and the culture media (at 1and 48h) of the tissue explant groups in coculture. k“_hesemediators were measured by ELISA in duplicate.All pro-teins were assayed using commercial ELISA developmentkits from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).IL-1β (Canine IL-1 Beta/IL-1F2 DuoSet, DY3747) and IL-10 (Canine IL-10 DuoSet, DY735) were assayed with species-speciﬁc canine antibodies for these mediators and HA(Hyaluronan DuoSet, DY3614) was determined using amultispecies detection ELISA kit.TGF-β 1(Human TGF-β1 DuoSet, DY240E) and PDGF-BB (Human PDGF-BBDuoSet, DY220) were determined using human antibodiesbecause there is a high sequence homology between theseproteins in mammals such as humans and canines [22, 23].Furthermore, similar ELISA antibodies have been used forthe same purposes in other canine PRP studies [24, 25].
k“_he standardsprovidedforeachELISAkitwereusedtoploteach standardcurveaccordingtothemanufacturers’instructions.Absorbance readings were performed at 450nm. 2.6.Statistical Analysis.k“_he Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the ﬁt of the data set to a normal distribution (goodness of ﬁt).All evaluated parameters demonstrated anormal distribution (P>0.05), except WBC counts in both hemocomponents.PLTin whole blood, PRP, and PPP werecompared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc Tukey test.WBC counts were ana- lyzed using a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by a Man-n–Whitney Utest.k“_he GF, cytokines, and HA contained in PPGS and PRGS were compared using a t-test for unpaired samples.
A generalized linear model (GLM) univariate analysis was followed (when necessary) by a Games–Howell test,which was used to compare biomolecule concentrations inculture media from each experimental group at 1 and 48h.k“_he statistical model evaluated the interactions over time attwolevels(1hand48h)andexperimentalgroupatsixlevels(control group, control group plus LPS, 25% and 50% PPG,and 25% and 50% PRGS). P<0.05 was accepted as statis- tically signiﬁcant for all tests.3.Results 3.1.Cell Counts in Whole Blood and Hemoderivatives.Platelet counts were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in whole blood,PRP, and PPP, with the highest counts for PRP, followed by whole blood and PPP (Figure 2(a)).A similar signiﬁcant ﬁnding was observed for WBC counts in whole blood andboth hemoderivatives.However, whole blood showed thehighest WBC concentrations, followed by PRP and PPP(Figure 2(b)).3.2.GrowthFactor,Cytokine,andHyaluronanConcentrationsin Platelet-Rich Gel and Platelet-Poor Gel Supernatants.

Notably, the concentrations for this catabolic molecule were signiﬁcantly higher in tissue explants cultured withPRGS at 50% at 48h than in the culture media of tissueexplant cultures with PPGS at 25% at the same time(Figure 4(a)). IL-10 concentrations were signiﬁcantly (P<0.001)af- fectedbytime,experimentalgroup,andtheirinteraction.Allthe experimental groups, excluding tissue explants culturedwith PRGS at 25%, presented similar concentrations of thisanti-inﬂammatory biomolecule at any time.However, thesynovial membranes and CEs cocultured with PRGS at 25%exhibited signiﬁcantly (P<0.001)higher IL-10 concentra- tionsat1hwhencomparedtoexperimentalgroupsculturedwith both PPGS and PRGS at 50% and then signiﬁcantly(P<0.001)diminished at 48h (Figure 4(b)).Hyaluronan concentrations in culture media from the experimental groups only were signiﬁcantly (P<0.001) aﬀected by time and by the interaction of this with theexperimental group factor (P�0.031).

k“_here are severalbiomolecules implicated in maintaining a healthy jointenvironment,whereasothersareoverproducedoncetheOAprocess is triggered [29]. Bearing this in mind, we selectedkey biomolecules, such as cytokines (IL-1β and IL-10), GFs (TGF-β 1and PDGF-BB), and the anabolic mediator HA, which are implicated in joint homeostasis and disease toevaluate the eﬀects of two platelet-related hemocomponents (PPRGS and PRGS) to some extent at two concentrations over a short period of time (48h) in an in vitrosystem that included the coculture of SMEs and CEs challenged withLPS.IL-1βwas selected because this proinﬂammatory and catabolic cytokine has been implicated as one of the mainmediators responsible for joint inﬂammation, cartilageerosion, and chondrocyte aberrant apoptosis [27, 30, 31].k“_hus,ithasbeenproposedthattheblockadeofthiscataboliccytokine could be a therapeutic target for controlling orameliorating OA [31, 32].
However, it is also important toconsider that in physiological conditions, this cytokine isimportant to maintain joint homeostasis through the reg-ulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [30]. IL-10was included in the present study due to its chon-droprotective eﬀects in OA tissues by increasing the syn-thesis of type II collagen and aggrecan and downregulating the expression and secretion of proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and TNF-a.Furthermore, this anti-inﬂam- matory cytokine inhibits chondrocyte apoptosis and thedownregulation of MMPs [27].HA was chosen for the present study because this nonsulfatedglycosaminoglycanproducedbytypeBsynovialﬁbroblasts and chondrocytes is of pivotal importance inmaintaining joint lubrication and viscoelasticity and im-provingcartilagecompressivestiﬀnessproperties[33].k“_hus,the production of HA could be considered a potentialbiomarkerforevaluatingtheeﬀectsofthehemocomponents evaluated in the present research.
Additionally, we also included the evaluation of TGF-β 1and PDGF-BB concen- trations—which are anabolic and anti-inﬂammatory bio-molecules with positive eﬀects in OA tissues—and why theyarecontainedatsupraphysiologicconcentrationsinplatelet-related products [17, 25]. For instance, TGF-β 1plays several roles in normal cartilage and during the OA process.
Under normal con-ditions, this GF is vital for extracellular matrix (ECM)turnover by increasing the synthesis of type II collagen, 0100200300400500 14 8 Time (h)IL-1β (pg/mL) Experimental groups Control group Control group + LPS PPGS 25% + LPSPPGS 50% + LPS PRGS 25% + LPS PRGS 50% + LPSb,B a,A(a) 0100200300400500 14 8 Time (h)IL-10 (pg/mL) Experimental groups Control group Control group + LPS PPGS 25% + LPSPPGS 50% + LPS PRGS 25% + LPS PRGS 50% + LPSb,c b,c b,c a,b,ca,b,c a,ba a,b,ca (b) Figure4:Cytokineconcentrationsinculturemediafromexperimentalgroupsat1and48h(a).(a)Mean(±SD)IL-1β concentrations(pg/ mL) (b) Mean (±SD) IL-10 concentrations (pg/mL).

k“_heinvitrosystemofcartilagedamage(OA)inducedby LPS in the present study is a common and widely validatedmethod for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms in the OAprocess [34] or investigating the eﬀect of several therapeuticsubstances [35–38], including platelet-related products [39, 40]. In general, LPS can interact with toll-like receptors (TLR) in synovial ﬁbroblasts or chondrocytes (e.g., TLR4and TLR-IL-1) to—as occurred with proinﬂammatorycytokines—induce the activation of NFκB transcription,which induces IL-1β and TNF-α upregulation with subse- quent proinﬂammatory stimuli [20, 34, 41].k“_he PRP-related product (PRGS) evaluated in the present study is a by-product derived from a platelet con-centrate classiﬁed as pure PRP, which is characterized by avery low or negligible WBC concentration [42].
Notably,these types of PRP products are more eﬀective in thetreatment of arthropathies when compared to PRP prepa-rations rich in leukocytes [15, 16, 43], which are known asleukocyte PRP (L-PRP) [42]. However, an experimentalstudy on dogs found no diﬀerences between both PRPproducts in terms of articular cartilage repair [44].On the other hand, the PRP evaluated in this study presented PLT countslowerthanthosereportedbypreviousclinicalstudieson dogs with OA [15–17].However, as previously men-tioned,thereleasesofthetypeplateletconcentrateevaluatedin the present study presenteda signiﬁcant concentration ofmediators with the potential to induce physiological re-sponses in the treated tissues.According to the reviewed literature, there are no published studies evaluating the eﬀect of PRP products incartilage, SMEs, isolated chondrocytes, or synovial ﬁbro-blasts in dogs.
k“_his fact led us to compare the results ob- tained in the present study with in vitro experiments performed on diﬀerent animal species, such as horses [39, 40] and humans [45]. In line with this, IL-1β con- centrationsat1hintheculturemediaofallevaluatedgroupsremainedlowerandincreasedabruptlyat48hinthosetissueexplants cultured with PPGS at 25% and PRGS at 50%.k“_heﬁndingsofthepresentstudydiﬀeredfromthoseobtainedbySundman et al.[45], who did not detect IL-1β signiﬁcant concentrations in the culture media from OA human car-tilage and synovium cocultured with a P-PRP product at96h.k“_he LPS added to culture media from experimentalgroups in the present research may have resulted in a more robust inﬂammatory response, which was exacerbated in those tissue explant groups cultured with PPGS at 25% andparticularly with PRGS at 50%.
From a mechanistic point of view, the increase in the concentration of this proinﬂammatory cytokine in culturemedia of both experimental groups at 48h could be relatedwith diﬀerent ways of cell response mediated by the speciﬁcconcentration of biomolecules contained in both hemo-components.However,unfortunately,inthisinvitrosystemof canine OA, we measured a limited number of mediatorsthat could be useful to establish if the higher IL-1β con- centrations were parallelly increased with another pro- oranti-inﬂammatory biomolecules, such as TNF-α, receptorantagonist of IL-1 (IL-1ra), and IL-4.
In line with this, two equine in vitrostudies [39, 40], which independently evaluated the eﬀect of similar hemo-components on the synovial membrane and cartilage ex-plants challenged with LPS presented similar TNF-αconcentrations in culture media at 48h; however, thosetissue explants cultured with a hemocomponent rich inplatelets(PRGS)exhibitedabetteranti-inﬂammatoryproﬁlewith increased concentrations on IL-1ra and IL-4 than that produced by the hemocomponent poor in platelets (PPGS). Furthermore, we observed a similar proinﬂammatory re-sponse pattern in ligament explants from horses challengedwithLPSandculturedwithsimilarhemocomponentswithabiphasic response characterized by a signiﬁcant increase inIL-1βover the ﬁrst 48h, followed by a dramatic decline at 96h [46].

It is possible that the speciﬁc concentration of mediators contained in this hemo-componentat25%hadinducedamorerobustreleaseofthisanti-inﬂammatory cytokine over the ﬁrst hour than the restof the evaluated hemocomponents at diﬀerent concentra-tions, perhaps mediated by cell concentration-sensitive re-ceptors of a speciﬁc mediator for stimulating IL-10production. However, it seems to be that despite the pro-duction of this cytokine being stimulated by PRGS at 25%overtheﬁrsthour,therearecompensatorymechanismsthatinduce intake of denaturation of the same over a more prolonged time to maintain it in an optimal concentration, as those observed for anti-inﬂammatory cytokines, such asIL-4 [39, 40].k“_his last hypothesis could indicate the reasonwhy the PRP injections in human OA knees did not aﬀectthe synovial ﬂuid concentrations of IL-10 over time [47].On the other hand, we observed that HA was produced by all tissue explant groups in coculture.
In general, theproduction of this mediator may have primarily beenstimulatedbyLPSat1h.However,at48h,coculturedtissueexplantswithPPGSat25%presentedasigniﬁcantlowerHAconcentration when compared to both control groups andthe same hemocomponent at 1h, which could indicate thatthis substance at 25% was unable to reverse the cataboliceﬀect of LPS at 48h. Notably, the HA release pattern fromour study was evaluated over a short period of time (only48h).k“_his fact could limit the interpretation of our resultsbecause the most robust response in HA production inequine joint tissue explants has been observed at 96h [20, 39].k“_hus, it is necessary to conduct new studies eval- uatingtheeﬀectsofthesetypesofhemoderivativesincaninejoint tissues over a longer period.We observed that the concentrations of TGF-β 1in the culture of all cocultured tissue explant groups treated withboth hemocomponents at any concentration presentedhighGF concentrations at 1h, followed by a signiﬁcant decreaseat 48h.
However, PDGF-BB concentrations, particularly inPRGS at 25%, were dramatically diminished at 48h. Ingeneral, similar concentration patterns for these mediatorshavebeenobservedinotherstudiesperformedbyourgroup in equine cartilage and synovial membrane explants that were cultured independently [39, 40].k“_he present study has several limitations that must be acknowledged to improve the understanding of readers.First, this is an in vitrostudy involving a biological system thatincludessomepiecesofthebiggerpuzzlerepresentingapatient or joint aﬀected by OA.
