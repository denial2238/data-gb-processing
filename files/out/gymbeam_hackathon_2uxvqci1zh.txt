Practice Lesson of the week Diagnosing vitamin B-12 deficiency on the basis of serum B-12 assay Vinod Devalia Serum vitamin B-12 concentrations are measured to assess the presence of its deficiency in patientspresenting with haematolological, neurological, andneuropsychiatric abnormalities.Replacement therapyis instituted promptly, particularly to prevent irrevers-ible neurological and cognitive dysfunction.I present two cases with paradoxical vitamin B-12 results, which highlight the fallacies of the serum vitaminB-12 assay and emphasise the importance of taking intoaccount the overall clinical picture before prejudgingthe significance of the vitamin B-12 assay result.Case reports Case 1A 59 year old white woman was seen urgently forassessment of a macrocytic anaemia.She had normalserum B-12 concentrations, confirmed on threeoccasions.She complained of progressively increasinglethargy, palpitations, and buzzing in the ears overabout three months.
She had a good, well balanced dietand was not a vegetarian. Apart from thyroxine, shewas taking no regular medication.She said her fatherhad had pernicious anaemia.On clinical examinationthe only clinically significant findings were a mild glos-sitis and pallor.A full blood count showed a substantialmacrocytic anaemia and a mild reduction of the whitecell count (figure).The blood film showed mild ovalmacrocytosis, occasional nucleated red cells, and somehypersegmented neutrophils.An urgent bone marrowexamination showed megaloblastic haemopoiesis.The most likely diagnosis, in the face of normal serum vitamin B-12 concentration, would have been amyelodysplastic syndrome needing urgent bloodtransfusion and further haematology assessment.However, in view of her history of thyroid disease andfamily history of pernicious anaemia, an underlyingfunctional vitamin B-12 deficiency could not beentirely discounted.
A blood sample for autoantibodyscreen, anti-intrinsic factor antibody, and serum homo-cysteine and methylmalonic acid were taken and shewas started immediately on replacement vitamin B-12therapy pending these results. She had a prompt response, with her full blood count returning to normal within eight weeks oftherapy (haemoglobin 126 g/l; mean cell volume87.5 fl) without the need for blood transfusion.Theresults of serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid were substantially raised and consistent with func-tional vitamin B-12 deficiency.The anti-intrinsic factorantibody was positive, confirming the diagnosis of per-nicious anaemia.Cytogenetic analysis of her bonemarrow was normal.Case 2 A 60 year old white woman with /afii9826thalassaemia trait had her serum vitamin B-12 concentration checked asshe mentioned that she was a vegan.She had no symp-toms of note and gave a history of avoiding meat andmilk products for the past eight years.
She had nofamily history of pernicious anaemia or other auto-immune conditions. She was not taking any medications.Her serum vitamin B-12 concentration was markedlyreduced (figure) —confirmed on three occasions —with a haemoglobin concentration at the lower end of theTest Serum B-12 (reference 132-675) (pmol/l)Serum folate (6.7-45.3) (nmol/l)Haemoglobin (115-165) (g/l)Mean cell volume (78.6-99.0) (fl)White cell count (4.0-11.0) (x10 9/l) Platelets (150-450) (x109/l) Plasma homocysteine (0.0-16.0) ( µmol/l) Plasma methylmalonic acid (0.10-0.42) ( µmol/l) Autoantibody screenAnti-intrinsic factor antibodyCase 2 77 17.7 115 71.5 4.3 167 12.50.87 NegativeNegativeCase 1 227 13.1 76 126.5 3.5 156 44.92.10 Negative PositiveCase 1 Case 2 Laboratory results and bone marrow appearances for the cases presented.Case 1 shows a normal serum vitamin B-12 concentrationwith biochemical features of B-12 deficiency (raised homocysteine andmethylmalonic acid).
The haematology indices (macrocytic anaemia)and bone marrow appearances are consistent with megaloblasticanaemia caused by classic pernicious anaemia, confirmed by a positiveanti-intrinsic factor antibody. Case 2 shows a markedly reduced serumvitamin B-12 concentration but largely unremarkable biochemicalfeatures (normal homocysteine concentration and slightly raisedmethylmalonic acid) of vitamin B-12 deficiency.The mild anaemia andreduced mean cell volume are consistent with a /afii9826thalassaemia trait, and the bone marrow appearances are normalThe clinical picture is ofutmostimportancewheninterpreting avitamin B-12assay result Princess of Wales Hospital, BridgendCF31 1RQ Vinod Devalia consultanthaematologist Vinod.Devalia@ bromor-tr.wales.nhs.uk BMJ 2006;333:385–6 385 BMJ VOLUME 333 19 AUGUST 2006 bmj.com normal range, consistent with her thalassaemia trait.On examination, there were no clinical features ofnote.
Her anti-intrinsic factor antibody was negativeand her serum ferritin concentration was withinnormal limits. Conventionally, she would have beengiven a course of vitamin B-12 injections immediately,and subsequently a Schilling test (or equivalent vitaminB-12 absorption study) would have been performed.Inview of her general wellbeing, a bone marrowexamination was done to evaluate any effect on eryth-ropoiesis as a marker for functional vitamin B-12 defi-ciency.The bone marrow showed normal erythropoi-esis, her plasma homocysteine was normal, and hermethylmalonic acid was raised sufficiently to indicatepossible subclinical deficiency.1 Discussion The diagnosis of vitamin B-12 deficiency has alwaysbeen problematic owing to the unavailability of arobust assay.
2Normal concentrations of vitamin B-12 have been reported in patients with overt deficiency,3 and the type of assay used may be relevant.4We use the Access Immunoassay System (Beckman Coulter)which has shown a coefficient of variation of 6-10%under the United Kingdom National External QualityAssessment Scheme in the recent past. This impliesthat the results obtained in the cases presented arequalitatively and quantitatively in defined categories of“normal” in case 1 and “deficient” in case 2.Case 1 highlights the dangers of a “false normal” vitamin B-12 result.The existence of a large “grey area”for vitamin B-12 assays with regard to interpretingdeficiency is well recognised.However, the repeated(three) results showing vitamin B-12 values in theupper part of the normal range in this patient is unu-sual.There may be unique analytical reasons in thispatient (for example, heterophil antibodies), althoughthis remains speculative.
Despite a normal result, adiagnosis of vitamin B-12 deficiency was consideredpossible, and so treatment started straightaway. Themore “logical” diagnosis —of myelodysplasia —would have led to her having a much more aggressive andpotentially detrimental therapy combining chemo-therapy and bone marrow transplantation.In case 2, the vitamin B-12 concentration was par- ticularly low despite the absence of clinical symptomsand normal bone marrow appearances.Possibly thepatient is developing vitamin B-12 deficiency.5 Last year about 8500 serum vitamin B-12 assays from primary and secondary care were done in our hae-matology laboratory, which serves a population of200 000.The number of assays is increasing annually byan average of 9%.T esting may be done as part of anassessment of anaemia, which may be mild, 6or as part of a screening process to assess neuropsychiatric symp-toms.7T esting for these disorders is increasing as a result of an increasingly older population.
Of the vitamin B-12tests done in our laboratory, 8% were in the “deficient”range ( < 107 pmol/l), 10% were in the “intermediaterange” (107-132 pmol/l), and 42% were in the “normal”range (132-227 pmol/l). It is difficult to know how manyof these may have true B-12 deficiency or functionalB-12 deficiency despite normal B-12 levels, particularlyif other coincident medical problems such as bleedingand liver or renal disease are present.It is difficult to know how many patients worldwide are diagnosed with myelodysplasia influenced by thepresence of a normal serum vitamin B-12 concentra-tion.Use of serum homocysteine and methylmalonicacid concentrations have been reported to help inidentifying elderly patients with vitamin B-12 defi-ciency in a screening situation 89and to demonstrate biochemical benefit in such patients given vitaminB-12 treatment empirically.
10However, a recent study of patients in an ambulatory setting also raised thequestion of whether homocysteine and methylmalonicacid were as reliable as generally believed. 11Measure- ment of holotranscobalamin II, another recent markerfor functional vitamin B-12 concentrations, is claimedto be more sensitive than methylmalonic acid 12but its clinical utility is open to question.13 Ultimately, meticulous clinical assessment — including assessment of other autoimmune conditionsand taking a family history —is important, given that a single ideal test is still not available.T esting foranti-intrinsic factor antibody, despite a normal serumvitamin B-12 concentration, can be particularly usefulwhen underlying pernicious anaemia is stronglysuspected, as in case 1.
However, a reduced serum vita-min B-12 concentration associated with a negativeanti-intrinsic factor antibody, as in case 2, may not helpin arriving at a diagnosis as only half of patients withpernicious anaemia are positive for this. Empiricaltreatment, to assess any clinical response and toprevent neurological damage, may be pragmaticallyjustifiable as the dangers of treatment are not as devas-tating as those of not treating.I thank the staff at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, who carried out methylmalonic acid and homocysteine assays in thetwo patients described, and Gareth Davies for takingphotographs of the bone marrow.Contributors: VD is the sole contributor.Competing interests: None declared.1 Carmel R.Current concepts in cobalamin deficiency.Annu Rev Med 2000;51:357-75.2 Ward PC.Modern approaches to the investigation of vitamin B12 deficiency.Clin Lab Med 2002;22:435-45.3 Lindenbaum J, Savage DG, Stabler SP, Allen RH.Diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency: II.
