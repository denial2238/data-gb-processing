Objective: To compare the effect of creatine supplementa- tion on thermoregulation in males and females during exercisein a thermoneutral environment. Design and Setting: Male and female subjects participated in 30 minutes of cycle ergometry in nonsupplemented (NS)andcreatine-supplemented (Cr) conditions at 70% to 75% of pre-determined peak oxygen consumption.Subjects: Ten male and ten female subjects were evaluated with and without creatine supplementation.Measurements: Analyses were performed during exercise for core temperature and mean skin temperature using two 23237 mixed-factorial analyses of variance (ANOVAs).We compared mean differences between NS andCrconditionsandsex for heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic bloodpressure using 3 2 3234 mixed-factorial ANOVAs.
Three 2 32 mixed-factorial ANOVAs were computed to examine differ- ences between sex and conditions for the following variables:nude body weight and blood urea nitrogen before and after ex-ercise and urine speci®c gravity.Results: Signi®cant time effects were found for core tem- perature, skin temperature, heart rate, and diastolic bloodpressure. Time effect and difference between the sexes forsystolic blood pressure were both signi®cant.Differencesin nude body weight and blood urea nitrogen before andafter exercise were greater for males, but there was nodifference between conditions.No signi®cant differencebetween sex and condition for urine speci®c gravity was not-ed.Conclusions: Short-termcreatinesupplementationdidnot affect thermoregulation between the sexes when exercisingin a thermoneutral environment.Differences in changesin nude body weight before and after exercise may be dueto a higher sweating rate in males versus females.
Differ-ences in blood urea nitrogen before and after exercise be-tween the sexes may be due to a reduced glomerular ®ltra-tion rate coupled with greater muscle creatine breakdown inmales. Key Words: males, females, hypohydration, exercise Creatine supplementation has been reported to increase intramuscular creatine stores by more than 20% in arelatively brief period (20 g´d 21for 5 days).1The re- lationship between elevated intramuscular creatine stores andthe subsequent increased potential for the rephosphorylization of adenosine triphosphate have led investigators to examinethe potential ergogenic effects of creatine supplementation.These ergogenic effects have been associated with anaerobicactivities, such as resistance training, in which evidence sup-ports alterations in skeletal muscle-®ber composition.2,3 Although the anaerobic ergogenic effects of creatine sup- plementation are well documented,2±8controversy continues as to whether this supplement poses a health risk.
Adverseeffects of creatine supplementation have been reported, 9but many of these risks lack supporting or refutable scienti®c ev-idence. This lack of evidence is due, in part, to the investi-gative focus on creatine supplementation as an ergogenic aidand not on side effects.With many athletes using creatine supplementation to en- hance performance, we need to investigate possible adverseeffects.Impaired thermoregulation as a consequence of crea- tine supplementation has been speculated to result from pos-sible dehydration.This speculation has recently been refutedwhen thermoregulation was not affected by creatine-supple-mentation protocols of 7 and 28 days in males exercising in a hot environment.10,11 Although creatine supplementation remains a widely inves- tigated topic, much information is availablefor males,butlittleis available for females.
12±16The potential exists for both sex- es to supplement with creatine for performance enhancement,thereby making themselves susceptible to possible adverse ef-fects. As a result, our purpose was to compare the thermoreg-ulatory effects of 7 days of creatine supplementation in malesand females exercising in a thermoneutral environment.Wehypothesized that short-term creatine supplementation wouldnot affect thermoregulation between the sexes in a thermoneu-tral environment.Subsequently, we speculated that anecdotalreports of dehydration associated with creatine supplementa-tion are not supported and that normal hydration practiceswithexercise may be followed when supplementing with creatine.Journal of Athletic Training 51METHODS Experimental Design Male and female subjects performed identical exercise ses- sions in a thermoneutral environment (temperature 524.05 6 1.638C, relative humidity 533.28 617.21%) before and im- mediately after 7 days of creatine supplementation.
Before theexercise sessions, we obtained anthropometric measurementsfor height, body mass, and body fat percentage (the latter viaskinfold assessment using the chest, abdomen, and thigh formales and the triceps, suprailium, and thigh for females 17). Additionally, subjects were evaluated for peak oxygen con-sumption (V Ç O2peak) via cycle ergometry.Within 5 days of the VÇO2peak assessment, subjects engaged in a 30-minute cycle- ergometry exercise bout at an intensity of 70% to 75%VÇ O2peak.This exercise session was considered the nonsup- plemented (NS) condition.Following the NS condition, subjects engaged in 7 days of creatine supplementation at 20 g´d21.Subjects were required to be free of creatine supplementation for at least 2 monthsbefore participating in the study.Two months were requiredbecause the washout period for muscle creatine levelstoreturnto baseline after supplementation is approximately 1 month.
18 None of our subjects indicated a history of previous creatinesupplementation. On the day immediately after the supplementation period (day 8), the subjects returned to the laboratory and were re-evaluated for a 30-minute cycle-ergometry exercise session atan intensity of 70% to 75% V Ç O2peak.This exercise session was considered the creatine-supplemented (Cr) condition.Wechose not to blind the subjects to the creatine supplement todetermine how subjects would react to knowingly taking asupplement.This design attempted to simulate what the sub-jects would have experienced if self-supplementing with cre-atine while engaging in outside (nonlaboratory) activities.Subjects The subjects were 10 males (age 523.80 63.58 years, height 5172.90 68.63 cm, body mass 570.90 610.63 kg, body fat percentage 59.3065.15%) and 10 females (age 5 21.1 62.9 years, height 5161.3 63.2 cm, body mass 5 62.40 69.47 kg, body fat percentage 522.35 65.38%).
The female subjects were evaluated during the follicular phase oftheir menstrual cycles. Menstrual phase must be consideredwhen evaluating thermoregulation in women because womenin the luteal phase exhibit increased coretemperatures,delayedonset of sweating, and delayed peripheral vasodilation com-pared with the follicular phase.19In this study, females self- reported the onset of menstrual bleeding, and menstrual phasewas determined as follows.The follicular phase begins withthe onset of menstrual bleeding and averages 15 days, with a range of 9 to 23 days.The ovulatory phase is 1 to 3 days, andthe luteal phase lasts approximately 13 days, ending with theonset of menstrual bleeding.20All subjects were informed of the purpose and possible risks involved in the investigationand were required to read and sign an informed consent priorto participation.
All procedures were approved by the univer-sity's institutional review board.Peak Oxygen Consumption Protocol Before the testing sessions, the subjects were evaluated for VÇ O2peak with a Monark cycle ergometer (model 818E; Var- berg, Sweden), using the protocol described by Astrand.21For the male subjects, a pedal rate of 50 revolutions per minutewas maintained, with an initial workload of 100 W. This work-load was increased by 50 W every 3 minutes until the criteriafor VÇ O2peak were met.For the female subjects, a pedal ca- dence of 50 revolutions per minute was maintained, with aninitial workload of 50 W.This workload was increased by 25W every 3 minutes until the criteria for V Ç O2peak were met.The criteria for V ÇO2peak in both sexes were a plateau in ox- ygen consumption (V ÇO2), an inability to maintain a minimum of 45 revolutions per minute for 1 minute, or volitional ex-haustion.
Testing Sessions The testing sessions consisted of 30 minutes of cycle er- gometry exercise at an intensity of 70% to 75% of the pre-viously determined V Ç O2peak in a thermoneutral environment. Before exercise, we measured nude body weight, urinespeci®cgravity, and serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN).The changesin nude body weight and BUN before and after exercise wereused for comparison between the NS and Cr conditions.Forurine speci®c gravity, preexercise values between the NS andCr conditions were used for comparison.Nude body weight was assessed before and after exercise on a standard medical scale (model 439; Detecto, Webb City,MO) and used to determine sweating rate during exercise.Urine speci®c gravity was measured using a hand refractom-eter (model A 300 CL clinical; Atago Co, Tokyo, Japan).
Ablood sample drawn from the antecubital vein permitted anal-yses of BUN levels via re¯ectance spectrophotometry with thedry-chemistry technique (Ektachem DT-60; Kodak, Hartford,CT) following the manufacturer's guidelines. All preexercisemeasurements were repeated postexercise, and the differenceswere used for comparison between the NS and Cr conditions.For the exercise bouts, baseline measurements were taken for core temperature (T r), mean skin temperature(T sk),systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), andheart rate (HR).Temperatures for T rand Tskwere displayed on a bench top thermometer (DigiSense scanning thermome-ter; Cole-Parmer Instrument Co, Vernon Hills, IL).A therm-istor was inserted approximately 10 cm beyond the analsphincter to obtain T r.
For T sk, skin-surface thermistors were placed on the right lateral aspect of the upper arm midwaybetween the acromion and olecranon process, the right pec-toralis major muscle approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) belowthe center of the clavicle, the right anterior thigh midway be-tween the anterior superior iliac spine and superior border ofthe patella, and the lateral aspect of the gastrocnemius at itsgreatest diameter. The T skwas calculated using the formula proposed by Ramanathan (0.3[t chest1tarm]10.2[tthigh1 tleg]).22 After baseline measurements were recorded, the subjects performed 30 minutes of cycle ergometry at 70% to 75% oftheir previously determined V Ç O2peak.During the exercise ses- sion, a pedal cadence of 60 revolutions per minute was main-tained, and oxygen consumption was continuously monitored(TrueMax 2400 metabolic measurement system; ParvoMedics,East Sandy, UT) to ensure proper maintenance of the pre-scribed exercise intensity.

We chose this dosageprotocolbecauseit signi®cantly increases intramuscularcreatinestores. 1,18After the creatine-supplementation protocol, subjects returned fortesting under conditions identical to the NS condition testing.The Figure provides a timeline of the experimental protocol.Statistical Analysis Analyses were performed for NS and Cr condition, sex, and time.Using T rand Tskas the dependent variables, we com- puted a 2 3237 mixed-factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA).The 3 independent variables included 2 within-subjects factors, condition (NS and Cr) and time (7 intervalsin 5-minute increments), and a between-subjects factor, sex.For HR, SBP, and DBP, a 2 3234 mixed-factorial ANOVA was calculated with the same independent variables; however,time was divided into 4 intervals of 10-minute increments.Finally, a total of three 2 32 mixed-factorial ANOVAs were computed with a between-subjects factor, sex, and a within-subjects factor, condition.
Two of the 3 dependent variablesexamined differences before and after exercise (nude bodyweight and BUN), whereas urine speci®c gravity was exam-ined by condition (NS versus Cr). The generalized leastsquares procedure (SPSS for Windows version 10.1; SPSS Inc,Chicago, IL) was used to calculate the statistics.For all anal-yses, the alpha level was set at P,.05.To test for basic assumptions, we computed the Mauchly test of sphericity forthe within-subjects factors of NS and Cr condition and time.The test analyzed the similarity of the treatment differencesacross the time intervals for all subjects.We used the Green-house-Geiser statistic to adjust for degrees of freedom.RESULTS Using the Mauchly test of sphericity, alldependentvariables were signi®cantly different ( P,.05).For T r, no signi®cantinteraction was found among sex, condition (NS and Cr), and time (F 2.57,46.30 52.57,P5.07).
In addition, no signi®cant interactions were found between sex and condition (F 1,185 0.89,P5.36), condition and time (F 2.57,46.30 50.19,P5 .88), and time and sex (F 1.55,27.99 51.27,P5.29). The anal- ysis of the main effects revealed no signi®cantmeandifferencein T rbetween condition (F 1,1850.039,P5.85) or sex (F 1,18 50.19,P5.67).However, signi®cant differences werefound among time intervals (F 1.55,27.99 5285.87,P5.00).Pairwise comparisons were computed to determine where signi®canceoccurred, showing signi®cant increases in T rat each time in- terval (Table 1).For Tsk, we found similar results.No signi®cantinteractions existed among sex, condition, and time (F condition 3time 3sex(2.82,50.93) 50.93,P5.48; F condition 3sex(1,18) 50.02,P5.88; Ftime 3sex(2.61,46.89) 51.82,P5.16; Fcondition 3time(2.82,50.93) 5 1.27,P5.29).Also, no signi®cant main effects were noted for condition (F 1,1852.54,P5.13) or sex (F 1,1851.18,P 5.29).
The main effect for time for T skwas signi®cant (F2.61,46.89 5305.76,P5.00). Skin temperature increased signi®cantly with each time interval except from 20 to 30 min-utes of exercise (Table 2).For HR, all interactions were nonsigni®cant, with time hav- ing a signi®cant main effect (F 1.35,24.34 51468.90, P5.00).Heart rate increased signi®cantly over each time interval.ForSBP, condition, sex, and time did not interact, but the inter-actions between condition and sex (F 1,1854.81,P5.04) and time and sex (F 2.17,38.98 57.80,P5.00) were signi®cant.A least signi®cant difference post hoc analysis was performedto determine where the signi®cance occurred.For conditionand sex, males had higher SBP for the NS and Cr conditions.For time and sex, males had signi®cantly higher SBP acrossall time intervals.For DBP, a signi®cant main effectwasfoundfor time.Baseline DBP was signi®cantly lower than at 10, 20,and 30 minutes of exercise.
Additionally, DBP at 10 minuteswas signi®cantly lower than at 20 and 30 minutes of exercise(Tables 3±5). For changes in nude body weight and BUN, the difference between the sexes was signi®cant (F nude body weight(1,18) 5 13.45,P5.00; FBUN(1,18) 528.86,P5.00), with males having higher mean scores than females.No signi®cant dif- Journal of Athletic Training 53Table 2.Mean Skin Temperatures Over Time During Exercise Sessions ( 8C) TimeMales Nonsupplemented Creatine SupplementedFemales Nonsupplemented Creatine Supplemented Baseline 5 min 10 min15 min20 min25 min30 min33.82 60.47 34.70 60.65 35.78 60.51 36.09 60.41 36.20 60.40 36.26 60.36 36.23 60.4033.74 60.80 34.39 60.74 35.50 60.83 35.84 60.75 35.95 60.69 35.92 60.67 35.95 60.6233.78 60.60 34.19 60.62 35.40 60.66 35.82 60.67 35.97 60.65 35.99 60.66 36.04 60.6733.67 60.82 34.07 60.72 35.09 60.60 35.41 60.90 35.78 60.68 35.85 60.70 35.85 60.73 Table 3.

DISCUSSION We investigated the differences in the thermoregulatory re- sponses of males and females after 1 week of creatine supple-mentation.Recent investigators 10,11have refuted anecdotal reports of dehydration as a consequence of creatine supple-mentation; however, these studies are few, and the authors didnot examine sex differences.
Kern et al 10suggested that body- water changes after 28 days of creatine supplementation mayaid in thermoregulation during exercise, whereas Volek et al 11reported that short-term (7 days') creatine supplementationdidnot affect thermoregulatory measures. Each of these groupsused males as subjects and examined thermoregulation in the heat (temperature 37 8C, humidity 25%, 10and temperature 378C, humidity 80%, respectively11).Thermoregulation depends on several factors, including the hydration state of the individual.10Therefore, dehydration as a consequence of creatine supplementation may adversely af-fect thermoregulatory measures in exercising individuals.De-hydration during performance results in an increased T r, cou- pled with increased cardiovascular strain.The increasedcardiovascular strain is manifested via a rise in HR throughoutexercise, resulting in higher HR levels at exhaustion versus 54Volume 39 xNumber 1 xMarch 2004Table 6.

Females may rely more heavily on the car-diovascular aspect of thermoregulation versus males, resultingin larger increases in HR and less evaporative weight loss infemales. 26Although cardiovascular processes for thermoreg- ulation may differ, in our study T rwas similar between the sexes.Additionally, both sexes were exercising at the samerelative intensity (70% to 75% V Ç O2peak), which may have reduced the sex differences in thermoregulation.Exercising atsimilar absolute intensities might have revealed a greater tol-erance to heat for the males versus the females because maleswould be working at a lower relative intensity.27 The stabilization of T skat 20 minutes of exercise may in- dicate a plateau in heat exchange via cutaneous vasodilation.Although females may rely more on cutaneous vasodilationfor thermoregulation, increased cutaneous blood ¯ow providesa mechanism for heat transfer from thecoretotheenvironmentfor both males and females.
26,27However, the continued rise in Trand HR for each sex suggests that cutaneousvasodilation was ineffective, in isolation, in providing adequate thermoreg-ulation. The continued rise in HR during the NS and Cr exercise sessions suggests similar cardiovascular strain for each con-dition.Had the creatine supplementation induced a dehydratedstate, HR near the end of the exercise bout for the Cr conditionwould have been greater than for the NS condition.Addition-ally, the lack of difference in HR between the sexes can beattributed to males and females both exercising at the samerelative intensity.Although the males may have been workingat a higher absolute workload to achieve the 75% V Ç O2peak, this difference in workload has been shown to be of conse-quence during exposure to hot and humid environments butnot in thermoneutral environments.19 Differences in blood pressure were found between the NS and Cr conditions and the sexes.
For both sexes, DBP de-creased during each exercise bout. Males had higher SBP thanfemales for both the NS and Cr conditions.Elevationsinbloodpressure have been speculated to be associated with creatinesupplementation because of ¯uid retention 28; however previ- ous investigations have not supported these speculations.11,15 In our study, both sexes exhibited normal blood-pressure re-sponses to exercise and did not differ between the NS and Crconditions.The difference in blood pressure between the sexesappears to have been due to males having a higher baselineblood pressure, which resulted in a higher exercise blood pres-sure.Nude body weight changed more in males before and after exercise than in females as a result of higher sweating rates,yet no preexercise and postexercise differences were noted be-tween supplementation conditions.
The higher sweating ratefor males indicates a greater reliance on the sweating mecha-nism for thermoregulation versus reliance on cardiovascularcomponents of thermoregulation for females. 26 Our data do not support dehydration with short-term crea- tine supplementation for either sex.Dehydration would resultin decreased sweat rates and a higher HR at the end of theexercise bout.Additionally, urine speci®c gravity values forboth sexes for the NS and Cr conditions were normal.We didnot measure changes in total body water, so we cannot supportthe speculation that the ¯uid retention associated with creatinesupplementation may aid in thermoregulation.10However,nei- ther males nor females were adversely affected by the creatinesupplementation, and the lack of differences in nude bodyweight before and after exercise between conditions suggestsadequate ¯uid-volume availability for the sweating mecha-nism.
Males had a greater change in BUN during exercise, yet changes in BUN for the sexes were not different between theNS and Cr conditions. Differences in BUN between the sexesmay be attributable to a greater decrease in glomerular ®ltra-tion rate in males, thereby elevatingplasmaureaconcentration.The glomerular ®ltration rate has been reported to decrease asmuch as 50% during heavy exercise, with greater decreasesoccurring during hypohydration.29Both sexeswereeuhydrated at each testing condition, and, therefore, normal reductions inrenal blood ¯ow would be expected.The greater amounts of muscle mass in males may have also contributed to higher levels of BUN due to the continualbreakdown of muscle creatine.Muscle creatine breakdown oc-curs at a relatively constant rate of 1.6% per day.30Because creatine is a nitrogen-containing compound, its continualbreakdown coupled with a decreased glomerular ®ltration ratewould result in elevated levels of BUN.
We are the ®rst to report on the sex differences in thermo- regulation while subjects were supplemented with creatine.Previous investigators have focused on thermoregulation and¯uid volume changes in males, reporting no adverse ef-fects. 10,11,31 Although our ®ndings are limited by the lack of subject blinding and uncontrolled (but monitored) temperatureandrel-ative humidity, we believe this study design had minimal ef-fects on the results because of similar ®ndings of other re-searchers.10,11We investigated the effects of short-term creatine supplementation using a dosage regimen that has beenreported to rapidly increase musclecreatinestores.1,18Ourdata do not support adverse effects on thermoregulation betweenthe sexes.The blood-pressure differences between the sexesdid not appear to be a result of the creatine supplementation; Journal of Athletic Training 55rather, the males had higher initial blood pressure readings compared with the females.
These results support previous®ndings that creatine supplementation does not adversely af-fect thermoregulatory capabilities, and we provide new dataon sex differences during exercise in a thermoneutral environ-ment.
