KEYWORDS linseed, ω-/three.tnum PUFAs, dietary supplementation, reproductive performance, ewes, subtropical /one.tnum Introduction Sheep play an important role in the livelihood and nutritional security of small and marginal farmers globally. The reproductive eﬃciency of sheep is compromised in subtropical climates because of nutritional and environmental factors.Improving the reproductive performance of sheep is important to improve and utilizelimitedanimalresourcesandmeethumans’needforquality animal protein.It has been previously reported that ﬂushing ewes before breeding can improve folliculogenesis, ovulation, and lambing rates in sheep ( 1,2).Nutritional interventions are preferred over hormonal interventions to augment the reproductive eﬃciency in livestock.It is generally accepted that nutrition not only increases the strength of animals but also determines their reproductive eﬃciency depending on the fatty acid (FA) composition of the diet ( 3,4).Liel et al.
( 5) reported that FA calcium soap supplementation increases the number and size of ovarian follicles and serum progesterone concentrations in cyclic sheep. The addition of fatty foods to the diet has long been used to reduce postpartum depression, improve energy balance to increase milk production, and signiﬁcantly improve fertility in lactating cows ( 6–8).Therefore, attention has been focused on determining the reproductive eﬀects of various FAs, particularly long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as omega-3 (ω-3)andomega-6( ω-6)FAs(8,9).Previous studies have shown that dietary supplementation of ω-3 PUFAs may have beneﬁcial eﬀects on the developmental processes of humans and animals ( 10).Mattos et al.
( 3) showed thatω-3 PUFAs can reduce uterine prostaglandin F2 α(PGF2 α) release and reduce the sensitivity of the corpora lutea (CL) to PGF2α,potentiallyaidinginpreventingluteolysisandfosteringthe establishmentofcowpregnancy.Omega-3PUFAsupplementation is associated with an increased conception rate, follicular turnover and growth, ovulation, CL size, and steroidogenesis ( 11,12). Moreover, increasing the long-chain ω-3 PUFA intake in the later stages of pregnancy prolongs the pregnancy and prevents behavioral abnormalities, such as the time taken for newborns to stand and breastfeed ( 13,14).Other studies have also highlighted theroleofnutritioninimprovingtheperformanceoffarmanimals such as buﬀalos ( 15–17), horses ( 18), and pigs ( 19,20).Omega-3 PUFAs used for animals to enhance their fertility can be obtained from varied sources.Flaxseed or linseed is one of the commonly available ingredients that are rich in ω-3 FAs and short-chain PUFAs (21).
Although ﬂaxseed supplementation in cows, buﬀalos, andpigshasbeenextensivelyresearched,informationonitseﬀects on nulliparous sheep is limited. In addition, studies on the eﬀect of ﬂaxseed supplementation on sheep reproduction in subtropical climates are lacking ( 2).Therefore, this study aimed to examine the eﬀects of ﬂaxseed supplementation on the fertility, endocrineproﬁle, hematological proﬁle, and serum FA proﬁle of sheep in a subtropicalclimate./two.tnum Materials and methods /two.tnum./one.tnum Experimental location The experiment was conducted at the Department of Veterinary Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, Rewa, Madhya Pradesh, India.Madhya Pradesh is located in central India, between latitudes 170◦and 25◦North and longitudes 72◦and 85◦East.It has a warm subtropical climate with an average annual precipitation of 1,128mm.The temperature ranges from 4◦C in winter to 45◦C insummer.
/two.tnum./two.tnum Selection of animal In this experiment, 48 healthy Marwari sheep, aged 1.5–2.5 years,wereused.Theaveragebodyweightoftheanimalswas42.38 ±1.25kg,andthebodyconditionscorewas3.6 ±0.07onascaleof 1–5. The animals were kept under a semi-intensive system, which included grazing for 6–8h per day.Before starting the experiment, the animals were conﬁrmed to be acyclic and healthy based on the following conditions: (1) no penetration behavior of the ram for 21 consecutive days; (2) absence of any signs of estrus (e.g., mucus discharge or frequent urination); (3) absence of the ovarian CL on ultrasound examination (7.5 MHz, Mindray, USA) twice at an interval of 10 days, and (4) serum progesterone spectrum (P 4) of<1ng/mL based on the blood samples taken 10 days before the beginning of the experiment.The experiment was performed during the ewes’ breeding season (October to November).

Ewes that were in heat were bred twice, at an interval of 12h, with proven rams. Six rams were used in the rotation for natural breeding.If an ewe remained motionless when mountedonbyaram,itwasconsideredtobeinheat.Thenumber of animals entering estrus (estrus induction rate) in each group was recorded.The estrus induction interval is deﬁned as the time between the start of treatment and the ﬁrst removal of the ram.The conception rate is calculated as the ratio of the number of conceived (or pregnant) ewes in each group to the total number ofewes.Thelambingrateiscalculatedastheratioofthenumberof ewesthatlambedineachgrouptothetotalnumberofmatedewes.Pregnancyinmatedeweswastestedbyluteinassay(ELISA)onday 18 of mating and conﬁrmed by transabdominal ultrasonography (7.5MHz,Mindray,USA)onday28ofmating.Duringthelambing period, the sheep were monitored 24/7, and each calving time was recorded.The gestation length was calculated from the day of ﬁrst breedingtothedayoflambing.

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the eﬀects of dietary supplementation of ω-3 PUFA derived from linseed on the reproductive parameters, critical hormonal proﬁles, and biochemistry in sheep during the breeding seasoninsubtropicalclimates. In the present study, the estrus induction rate was signiﬁcantly higher in all treatment groups than in the control group.Similarly, the estrus induction interval was signiﬁcantly shorter in group III.Thecontrolewesrecordedsigniﬁcantlylowerconceptionrates,and thelambingratesweresigniﬁcantlyhigherinlinseed-supplemented sheep.Mahla et al.( 2) demonstrated that supplementation of ﬁsh oil with n-3 PUFAs for ewes improved their follicle numbers, ovulation rates, and twinning percentages.El-Shahata and Abo- Elmaaty ( 25) reported increased ovarian preovulatory follicles and ovulation rates in ewes after supplementation with calcium salts of long-chain FAs.According to Mahla et al.
( 26), supplementing ω-3 PUFA-rich ﬁsh oil in goats signiﬁcantly increased their follicle count, ovulation rate, and kidding rate as well as the follicle size. In a study conducted by Garcia-Bojalil et al.( 27), supplementation of calcium salts of long-chain FAs increased the number of CLs, decreased the time for the initial increase in progesterone, and restored the pattern of accumulated plasma progesterone concentrations.Moreover, the use of FA calcium soaps during ﬂushing has been conﬁrmed to be eﬀective in improving fertility and lambing rate ( 28).Similarly, n-3 PUFAs Frontiersin VeterinaryScience /zero.tnum/six.tnum frontiersin.org Akhtar et al.

improved the conception rate, follicular turnover, and growth in cattle(11,12,29).Somestudiesalsoreportedthatsupplementation with n-3 PUFA increased the number of small ( 30,31), medium (29,32), and large ( 33) follicles in cattle, indicating that n-3 PUFA aﬀects the follicular dynamics. Cattle supplemented with ﬂaxseed oil and ﬁsh oil were found to have increased number of small follicles ( 34,35).According to Ambrose et al.( 11), cows fed with ﬂaxseed oil showed a greater conception rate in a ﬁxed timedartiﬁcialinsemination(AI)thancowsfedwithsunﬂoweroil.Similarly, Dirandeh et al.( 36) observed a 66.7% increase in the conception rate in cows supplemented with ﬂaxseed compared to thatincontrolcows.Naziretal.( 16)observedincreasedconception rates in buﬀaloes supplemented with ﬂaxseed on day 63 post-AI than in the control buﬀaloes.Akbarinejad et al.( 37) reported no change in their ﬁndings, which is in contrast to the ﬁndings of the present study.
This diﬀerence in results could be attributed to multiplefactors,includingthedurationofPUFAsupplementation, thesourceofPUFA,climatevariation,andbreeddiﬀerences. PUFAs are precursors of PGs, which play multiple roles in animal reproduction ( 9).Mammals must obtain PUFAs from their diet because they lack the enzymes essential to synthesize PUFAs internally ( 38).Arachidonic acid (AA), an n-6 PUFA, serves as the precursor for pro-inﬂammatory 2-series PGs.Conversely, animals can also experience anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects by consuming food rich in n-3 PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3).According to Abayasekara and Wathes ( 39), PG metabolism can be aﬀected by the ratio of n- 6 to n-3 PUFAs in the diet.In vivoandin vitroexperiments have established that n-3 PUFAs reduce endometrial PG synthesis, thereby contributing to embryo survival ( 40–42).
PUFAs are involved in a number of processes that play crucial roles in the normal ﬂuidity of cell membranes and intracellular signaling ( 9), aswellasinovulation,fertilization,andparturition( 39). The present study demonstrated that ω-3 PUFA-rich linseed supplementation did not aﬀect gestation length in sheep.This ﬁnding is consistent with studies in sows supplemented with ω-3PUFA-rich ﬂaxseed around the breeding time, which did not alter the pregnancy length ( 20,43).Mattos et al.( 44) revealed that supplementing cows with ﬁsh oil during the peri-partum period had no eﬀect on the gestation length.By contrast, the gestation length was extended by 2 days (147.5 vs.
145.5 days) in ewes supplemented with ﬁsh oil in the late gestation period comparedtothosesupplementedwithMegalac( 14).Theseﬁndings may be explained by the fact that, in the present study, diets rich in ω-3 PUFA were supplemented during the early gestation period, whereas when ω-3 PUFA was supplemented during the late gestation period, prolonged gestation has been observed. A diet supplemented with PUFAs can aﬀect the gestation length by altering the types and quantities of PGs synthesized, which are essentialforparturition( 45).The present study demonstrated that the serum estrogen and progesterone concentrations were signiﬁcantly aﬀected by linseed supplementation.These results are in accordance with previous studies conducted on PUFA-fed sheep ( 25,46) and goats ( 47).Sklan et al.( 48) showed that cows fed with calcium salts of FAs producedhigherprogesteroneduringtheestrouscyclethancontrol cows.According to Petit and Twagiramungu ( 12) and Dirandeh et al.
(36), cows that received ﬂaxseed supplements had higher P4levels. An increased number of CLs and improved ovarian steroidogenesis may account for this increase in progesterone levels.According to Hawkins et al.( 49), increased P 4in cows fed with calcium salts of long-chain FAs may be related to reduced P 4 clearance from the plasma rather than increased luteal cell uptake of cholesterol.Nevertheless, Robinson et al.( 50) observed lower plasmaprogesteroneincowstreatedwithPUFAsintheearlyluteal phase.Higher proliferator-activated receptors have been linked to higher plasma concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid ( 51), which could lead to a decrease in P 4clearance ( 52).Conception rates may also increase with PUFA feeding because of the increased productionP 4duetoincreasedCLanddecreasedembryomortality (8,12,53,54).
FA supplementation in cyclic ewes increased the levels of progesterone in the blood and the size and number Frontiersin VeterinaryScience /zero.tnum/seven.tnum frontiersin.org Akhtar et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fvets./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/four.tnum./one.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/six.tnum/one.tnum of ovarian follicles ( 5).According to Rawlings et al.( 55) and Bartlewskietal.( 56,57),feedinganFA-concentrateddietincreased themeanserumestrogen(pg/ml)contentinsheepbythreetofour times.The unsaturated FA content of linseed has been shown to improvethephysicalpropertiesoffolliclesandoocytes( 58,59).In the present study, the hemoglobin concentrations in the treatment groups increased signiﬁcantly on day 60 compared to that in the control group; however, no eﬀect was recorded on day 30.Unfortunately, studies on sheep are not available in the literature that could be used for comparison.
However, the pattern of change in the hemoglobin level was similar to that of the observations of other studies that used ﬂaxseed oil in rats ( 60,61). The addition of linseed oil to broiler chicks produced a non- signiﬁcantshiftintheconcentrationsofhemoglobin( 62).Interms ofPCV,theresultsofthepresentstudyshowedthatthepercentage of PCV increased on days 30 and 60 of linseed supplementation.ImprovementofPCVduetolinseedsupplementationcouldbedue to its high content of PUFA, which protects the cell membrane of red blood corpuscles.In another study on rats, ﬂaxseed oil improved the TEC and PCV owing to its high content of n-3 PUFA(63).Similarly,inthecaseoftheTLCandTEC,asigniﬁcant eﬀect of linseed supplementation was observed on day 60.Similar proﬁles of the TEC were recorded in other studies on linseed- fed lambs ( 64–66).
Furthermore, a study on Iraqi Awassi lambs fed with ﬂaxseed oil showed improved hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, and blood glucose levels as well as decreased TLC after oral dosing ( 67). Supplementing with linseed may result in reticulocytosis, induce polycythemia, and boost erythropoietic activity in the liver and spleen.Shunthwal et al.( 68) showed that feeding broiler chicks linseed oil enhanced their blood parameters and,consequently,then6/n3ratioofFAsinthebodysystem.The ﬁndings of the present study indicated a statistically signiﬁcant increase in blood glucose levels in the treatment groups on days 45 and 60 compared to the control group.These ﬁndings are consistent with the results of Kia and Safdar ( 46).However, ﬁshoildidnotsigniﬁcantlyaﬀectthebloodglucoselevelsinsheep, accordingtoMahlaetal.( 2).FAscanhaveadirectimpactoninsulin secretion triggered by glucose.
Saturated FAs are insulinogenic, implying that they have a stronger eﬀect on insulin secretion than unsaturated FAs ( 69,70). Furthermore, lipid supplements with various FA compositions can alter the release of gastrointestinal peptides such as glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide 1.Thus, as observed in Holstein cows, this alteration may improve glucose-mediated insulin secretion ( 71).Cows fed diets enriched with ﬂaxseed (linseed) and ﬁsh oil had higher plasma glucose levels ( 29,72).Conversely, ewes fed diets enriched with ﬂaxseed oil did not show a signiﬁcant change in glucoselevels( 73).In the present study, linseed supplementation signiﬁcantly reduced serum MUFA concentration but signiﬁcantly increased serum PUFA concentration from day 15 of supplementation.There is a lack of literature on the eﬀect of feeding linseed to sheep on their serum MUFA and PUFA proﬁles.Mahla et al.
(2) found that feeding PUFA to ewes signiﬁcantly aﬀected their plasma total cholesterol as well as high- and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations. Similarly, Abuelfatah et al.(74) found that feeding whole linseed to goats increased theconcentration of PUFA in the rumen.According to Singh et al.(75,76), feeding boars linseed oil can boost antioxidant indicators and signiﬁcantly reduce lipid peroxidation in their seminal plasma and serum.Furthermore, because linseed oil contains a higher concentration of these FAs than other oils, feeding sheep linseed oil may alter their serum PUFA and MFA proﬁles.This ﬁnding is consistent with the ﬁnding of Petit et al.( 29).Although the present study provides the ﬁrst comprehensive results on the reproductive performance of sheep fed linseed in subtropical climates, it has limitations related to a small number of animals and a short duration of study.
It would be interesting to investigate the long-term eﬀects of ﬂaxseed supplementation. Furthermore,future studies focusingon follicular dynamics, follicular atresia, and embryonic development wouldbeinteresting./five.tnum Conclusion Supplementing linseed to nulliparous ewes for 2 months during the breeding season in subtropical climates improved their reproductive eﬃciency by modulating the hormonal and biochemical milieu.Ewes that were fed linseed (15%) had a signiﬁcantly higher rate of estrus induction, a shorter estrus induction interval, and an increased rate of conception and twinning.Simultaneously, linseed supplementation resulted in increased serum P 4concentration, decreased serum MUFA levels, and increased serum PUFA levels.The study suggests that strategic dietary adjustments, such as the inclusion of 15% linseed during the breeding season, can signiﬁcantly enhance reproductive outcomes in sheep farmed in subtropicalclimates.
