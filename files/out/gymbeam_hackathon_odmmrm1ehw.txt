Prevalence of maternal iron deficiency in the last trimester based on low body iron stores was 16%. Preva- lence of active placental malaria infection was 24.8%, past infection 59% and chorioamnionitis 55.6%.Babies of iron supplemented women had lower median ges- tational age.Four out of five children ≥6 months were iron deficient, and 98% were anaemic.At 4 months malaria prevalence was 45%.Child iron biomarkers, anaemia and malaria outcomes did not differ by trial arm.Factors associated with childhood parasitaemia were third trimester C-reactive protein level (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1 –3.9), active placental malaria (OR 5.8; 1.0 –32.5, P= 0.042) and child body iron stores (OR 1.13; 1.04 –1.23, P= 0.002).Chorioamnionitis was associated with reduced risk of child parasitaemia (OR 0.4; 0.1 –1.0,P= 0.038).Periconceptional iron supplemen- tation of young women did not alter body iron stores of their children.
Higher child body iron stores and placental malaria increased risk of childhood parasitaemia.

falciparum infections during pregnancy (Park et al., 2020), with several studies identifying an association of increased child malaria with placental malaria in their mothers (Agbota,Accrombessi, et al., 2019; Asante et al., 2013; Awine et al., 2016; Bardají et al., 2011; Le Port et al., 2011; Schwarz et al., 2008; Sylvester et al., 2018; Sylvester et al., 2016).
Given the protective effect of irondeficiency during pregnancy for malaria (Diallo et al., 2020; Kabyemela, Fried, Kurtis, Mutabingwa, & Duffy, 2008; Moya-Alvarez et al., 2015; Senga, Harper, Koshy, Kazembe, & Brabin, 2011), it fol-lows that young children born to iron replete mothers, enhanced by routine periconceptional or antenatal iron supplementation, could be at higher risk of malaria, although the issue is complex as immunologi-cal mechanisms (Brickley et al., 2015; Broen, Brustoski, Engelmann, &Luty, 2007; Dechavanne et al., 2017; Feeney, 2020; Hviid, 2009; Hviid & Staalsoe, 2004; Park et al., 2019; Sylvester et al., 2018) and maternal factors such as breast feeding and use of antimalarial drugs are rele-vant (Hawking, 1954; Kakuru, Staedke, Dorsey, Rogerson, & Chan- dramohan, 2019; Natama, Rovira-Vallbona, Sorgho, et al., 2018).
To determine childhood malaria risk in relation to maternal and offspring iron status a cohort of children born to mothers who partici- pated in a randomised double blind controlled safety trial of per- iconceptional weekly iron supplementation (Gies et al., 2018) wasassessed during the peak month of malaria transmission towards theend of the trial. A child safety survey became necessary after publica- tion in 2012 (post trial commencement) of two cohort studies that reported iron repletion predicted increased malaria risk in pre-schoolchildren in Malawi (Jonker et al., 2012) and Tanzania (Gwamaka et al., 2012).The objectives of this cross-sectional child safety study were firstly, in children under 2 years of age, to determineprespecified malaria-related outcomes and anaemia and iron bio- markers by trial arm, and secondly, to characterise maternal and child iron status and related factors associated with child malaria.
2|MATERIALS AND METHODS Written, informed consents were given by all individuals, with addi- tional guardian consents provided for minors. The work described was carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medi-cal Association (Declaration of Helsinki).The primary trial outcome was malaria prevalence at the first antenatal visit, but women werefollowed till delivery and gestational age, preterm birth, birthweight, placental malaria and neonatal deaths have been reported (Gieset al., 2018).The survey in children was introduced as a safety amend- ment to the registered trial protocol with a prespecified secondary outcome of malaria parasite prevalence.The main results of the studywere communicated to communities at the end of the study.2.1 |Trial procedures The main trial was undertaken between April 2011 and January 2014 in the rural area of Nanoro in Burkina Faso where malaria is hyper-endemic with seasonal transmission.
The study participants were enrolled within the Nanoro Health and Demographic Surveillance catchment area which had a population of approximately 55000inhabitants. HIV prevalence in this population was 1.2% in women aged 15 –49 years and 0.76% among pregnant women (Institut National de la Statistique et de la Démographie [INSD] et ICFInternational, 2012).Background and published data on the trial,randomisation and design (Brabin, Gies, et al., 2019; Diallo et al., 2020; Gies et al., 2018) are summarised in Appendix S1.2.2 |Pregnancy assessments Nulliparous participants had been individually randomised to receive, directly observed, either a weekly capsule containing ferrous gluco- nate (60 mg) and folic acid (2.8 mg) ( n= 980), or an identical capsule containing folic acid alone (2.8 mg) ( n= 979) for up to 18 months, or till pregnancy occurred (Gies et al., 2018; Appendix S1).Iron status was assessed at recruitment.
For women who became pregnant, avenepuncture sample was collected for measurement of iron statusand malaria infection at a study antenatal visit scheduled at around 13–16 weeks gestation (ANC1) and at a second scheduled study visit between 33 and 36 weeks gestation (ANC2). At delivery the placentawas analysed for malaria parasites.From ANC1 onwards women received standard antenatal care including daily iron and folic acidKey messages Iron deficiency prevalence in young mothers in Burkina Faso was low.Periconceptional iron supplements did not alter placental or child malaria risk.Malaria parasitaemia risk was higher in children with bet- ter iron status.Placental malaria increased risk of child malaria.Intensified efforts are needed to reduce risk of placental malaria which should, in turn, reduce risk of malaria and anaemia in young children.2o f1 3 GIES ET AL.bs_bs_banner supplements until delivery (60-mg iron, 400- μg folic acid daily).
All women received a first dose of intermittent preventive treatment with sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (IPTp) at ANC1 if gestational age was>13 weeks. Women ≤13 weeks gestation, if positive for malaria by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) (Bioline SD, Malaria Antigen Pfdetecting P.falciparum histidine-rich protein 2), were treated with oral quinine.A second scheduled IPTp-SP dose was provided through routine antena-tal care.Gestational age was estimated by ultrasound examination at ANC1 with a FF Sonic UF-4100 (Fukuda Denshi) scanner, with mea- surement of crown rump length in the first trimester and by biparietaldiameter, femur length and abdominal circumference afterward.2.3 |Newborn assessments At delivery study nurses examined babies within 24 –48 h of delivery, and recorded birthweight, using an electronic scale to within 10 g(SECA 384, Hamburg, Germany, precision ± 5 g for weights < 5000 g, ±10 g above 5000 g).Delayed umbilical cord clamping was routinely practised.
Following hospital delivery, placental biopsies (2.5 ×1 cm) were excised from fetal and maternal sites at mid-distance between umbilical cord insertion and the placental border and placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Rural health centres were also trained andequipped to take placenta samples.Placental biopsies were not avail- able from home deliveries.2.4 |Child assessments In the wet season in October 2013, mothers who had delivered and remained in the study area were invited to have their offspring assessed at the Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro (CRUN) Health Clinic.The follow-up child assessment was performed by experi-enced paediatric nursing research staff and included: medical and vaccination history (BCG and polio at birth; pentavalent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type B and polio at 2, 3 and 4 months; measles at 9 months; yellow fever at 12 months).
Health cards were examined and reports of recent ill- ness, fever and drug intake within the last 2 weeks were checked.Anthropometric measurements were performed in duplicate by twoindependent observers and mean values computed. Children were weighed to the nearest 10 g with an electronic scale (SECA 384, Hamburg, Germany, precision ± 5 g for weights < 5000 g,±10 g above 5000 g).Length was measured to the nearest 5 mm using a measuring mat (SECA 210, Germany) and mid-upper arm cir- cumference to the nearest mm using a circumference tape (SECA201, Germany).Clinical examination was completed with tempera- ture.A venepuncture blood sample was collected.The volume of blood sampled differed by weight, 1 ml in EDTA and 4 ml in a drytube for infants ≥5600 g and 0.5 and 3.0 ml, respectively, for lower weights.
This was used for malaria microscopy and RDT for malaria, Hb, serum iron biomarkers (ferritin, transferrin receptor and zincprotoporphyrin), C-reactive protein (CRP) and a reserve filter paperblood spot. Children diagnosed with malaria, or any other concur- rent health problem, received free treatment according to National Guidelines, with appropriate follow-up.2.5 |Laboratory procedures Blood samples were transported within 3 h from the clinic to the cen- tral project laboratory at CRUN.Sera aliquots were stored at −80/C14C.Hb was measured (Sysmex automated analyser) and ZPP by fluorome-try (Aviv Biomedical) on fresh whole blood.Anaemia in chil- dren ≥6 months was defined as Hb < 11 g dl −1.Plasma ferritin and TfR were measured using mean values from duplicate ELISA samples(Spectro Ferritin S-22 and TFC 94 TfR, RAMCO Inc.) and CRP by ELISA (EU59131IBL, GmbH).Intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were all <10%.
Ranges for normal controls were ferritin, 69.1 – 114.7 μgL −1; sTfR, 4.2 –5.9 mg L−1; CRP, 5 –8m gL−1. Definitions of iron status were based on (1) adjusted ferritin using the internal regression correction approach (Namaste et al., 2017), allowing for inflammation as described by Mei et al.(2017), or (2) the ratio of sTfR(mg L −1) to log 10ferritin ( μgL−1), which assesses both stored and functional iron and is possibly less affected by inflammation.Values > 5.6 in children derive from the cut-offs sTfR > 8.3 μgm l−1 and ferritin < 30 μgL−1.This best predicted iron deficient bone mar- row stores using the same assay as in the present study, in an area of high malaria transmission (Phiri et al., 2009).Body iron stores (BIS)(mg kg −1) using the regression-adjusted ferritin estimate were calcu- lated using the equation derived by Cook, Flowers, and Skikne (2003): body iron (mg kg−1)=−[log 10(1000 ×sTfR/ferritin) −2.8229]/0.1207 [39].Low BIS was defined as <0 mg kg−1.
Plasma hepcidin was mea- sured by competitive ELISA at an International Reference Laboratory (Kroot et al., 2010). A malaria RDT was performed.Malaria parasite density was obtained from the mean count of two independentreaders counting the number of asexual parasites per 200 white blood cells in a thick blood film stained with 3% Giemsa, assuming a white cell count of 8000/ μl.For discrepant findings (positive/negative; more than twofold difference for parasite densities ≥400/ μl; >log 10if <400/ μl), a third independent reading was made, with the mean of the two closest observations accepted as the true value.2.6 |Placental histology After the delivery of the placenta, it was placed in a receptacle fetal side upwards.Using scissors, a biopsy of 2.5 cm ×1 cm was excised at mid-distance between the insertion of the umbilical cord and theplacenta border and placed into a prefilled specimen container with 10% neutral buffered formalin (CellStor Pot, CellPath Ltd.Newtown SY16 4LE, UK).
A 1 cm cross-section from the umbilical cord was cutwith scissors at about 5 cm from the insertion and placed into the same receptacle. After turning the placenta in order to expose the maternal side upwards, a second biopsy of about the same size wasexcised at half distance between the centre and the border of theGIES ET AL.3o f1 3bs_bs_banner placenta and placed into a second container with formalin.A 10 cm ×10 cm piece of the membrane was cut with scissors and placed into the same container.Formalin fixed specimens were stored for up to 3 months at room temperature in an air-conditioned room (20/C14C) at the CRUN labora- tory.After transport to the department of pathology at the NationalUniversity Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo in Ouagadougou, tissue sam-ples were processed by experienced technicians according to standard histopathological procedures.Samples were embedded in paraffin wax following standard methods.
Membranes were rolled to cylinders in order to obtain suffi- cient material to be cut and embedded. For each set of samples, paraf- fin sections 3 to 5 μm thick were placed on two slides, the fetal side of the placenta together with the cord on one slide, the maternal side of the placenta together with the membrane on another slide.Slides were prepared in duplicate to allow for different staining.De-paraffinised sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin andGiemsa stain.Histological examination of all samples was done by a specialised senior pathologist with light microscopy and under polarised light.Histological classification of placental malaria wasbased on the different significance of haemozoin and parasitised RBC in the intervillous space of the maternal side of the placenta as described by Ismail et al.
(2000): acute infection (only parasites andminimal haemozoin deposition in the macrophages but not fibrin), chronic infection (parasites and haemozoin deposition), past infection (haemozoin usually mixed with fibrin but no parasites) and no infec-tion. Chorioamnionitis was graded histologically following the Redline-classification (Redline, 2002).2.7 |Statistical analysis The sample size was determined from formal power calculations for the malaria trial endpoints (Gies et al., 2018).The number of children available for assessment per study arm is shown in Figure S1 (see Appendix S2).The primary analyses presented here are comparisonsof prespecified child malaria-related outcomes and placental malaria in babies by trial arm on an intention to treat basis.Iron and inflamma- tion biomarkers and placental chorioamnionitis were prespecifiedexploratory outcomes.Preterm was defined as a live birth or stillbirththat took place at least 20 but before 37 completed weeks.
Fetal growth restriction (SGA) was defined as birthweight below the 10th centile for gestation and gender, indicated by standard reference data(Villar et al., 2014). Clinical malaria was defined as fever or history of fever ( ≥37.5 /C14C) in the previous 48 h with parasitaemia.Outcomes were summarised by median (interquartile range) or N(%) and com- pared between treatment arms using ordinary or logistic regression models adjusting for child sex and age at assessment.Age was fitted with a cubic spline function with 5 degrees of freedom, with sensitiv-ity analyses confirming that this was a sufficient representation of the non-linear age relationships.Results are presented as odds ratios for categorical outcomes or differences between arms for continuous var-iables with 95% CI.Where appropriate, outcomes were logtransformed and the presented effect size can be interpreted as a ratio between arms.
Malaria prevalence by age in various subgroups was visualised using the fitted probabilities from a logistic regression model using a cubic spline representation with the degrees of freedom selected to capture the main features of the age trends without spurious artefacts.Shading around the fitted lines to indicate ±1SE, and rugplots showingthe location of positive and negative values (tick marks along top and bottom axes) were added where these did not obscure the presentation. The associations between infant/maternal factors and infant malaria were assessed using logistic regression models for malaria out- comes against the relevant factors, adjusting for age and sex as above.The associations between iron biomarkers and malaria were visualised as scatterplots of the relationship between the biomarker and age for the children with and without malaria, with cubic spline regressionlines added for each group.All analyses were performed in the R sta-tistical environment version 3.6.
2.8 |Ethical considerations This child outcome analysis was conducted as a safety assessment of malaria risk in the first born offspring of young mothers enrolled in a randomised periconceptional trial of weekly iron and folic acid supple- mentation (PALUFER). The study received ethical approvals in BurkinaFaso; National Ethics Committee (CERS Ref 015-2020/CE-CM) and the Comité d'Ethique pour la Recherche en Santé du Centre Muraz (015-2010/CE-CM); the United Kingdom Research Ethics Committee,Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM/REC protocol 10-55);the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (IRB/AB/AC/016) and the Antwerp University Hospital Ethics Com- mittee, Belgium (EC/UZA).The trial was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov on 27 September 2010: https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/ NCT01210040.3|RESULTS 3.1 |Participants During the trial 478 pregnancies occurred, with 348 known deliveries occurring before the survey period (Figure S1 in Appendix S2).
Follow-ing exclusions due to out-migration, stillbirths and neonatal and infant deaths, there were 262 babies eligible for this study. Of these, 180 (69% of those eligible) were contacted, assessed and included inthe primary analyses presented here.3.2 |Maternal and child characteristics by trial arm Maternal characteristics at delivery and offspring characteristics by trial arm are shown in Table 1.Maternal characteristics of children4o f1 3 GIES ET AL.bs_bs_banner surveyed did not differ from those of children lost to follow-up (see Table S1 in Appendix S2).Maternal iron biomarkers did not differ by trial arm and prevalence of maternal iron deficiency basedon low BIS at ANC2 was 16%.Prevalence of placental malaria (active and past infection) was 86% in supplemented women and 81% in controls.Babies born to iron supplemented women hadshorter median gestational age and lower mean birthweight (Brabin, Gies, et al., 2019).
The median age of children surveyed was 9.1 months (range 1 –22 months), 20% were undernourished (Zscore ≤2SD), 2.2% were referred for severe malnutrition (Zscore ≤3SD) and three children had received recent haematinics. Malaria and iron biomarker outcomes are outlined in Table 2.In children ≥6 months, 69% were iron deficient (based on a sTfR/log ferritin ratio > 5.6), 33% had low BIS and 98% were anaemic.In children ≥6 months, low BIS prevalence was higherthan in younger children < 6 months (33% vs.6%, P< 0.001).Mean Hb concentration, iron biomarkers levels or anaemia preva- lence in children did not differ between trial arms, nor were theresignificant differences for any malaria-related outcomes.Median CRP concentration increased from 2.7 mg L −1in children ≤6 months to 6.3 mg L−1for older children ( P< 0.001), but values did not dif- fer by trial arm.
3.3 |Child malaria prevalence and iron biomarkers for combined trial arms Parasite prevalence increased from low values at 1 month to approxi- mately 45% by 4 months, with positive RDT prevalence increasing to 70% at this age.

Higher zinc protoporphyrin concentration was associated with malaria infec- tion ( P= 0.003). Gestational age at delivery, SGA, and child undernu- trition were not associated with childhood malaria risk.Child malaria infection prevalence grouped by categories of active and past placental infection are shown in Figure 3.Placental malaria infection was associated with higher malaria infection prevalence at all child ages.The difference in childhood malaria infection risk associ-ated with placental malaria occurred after about 3 –4 months of age and persisted through the second year.The difference in childhoodmalaria infection prevalence associated with active or past placental infection was ≤10%, with higher estimates for active placental infec- tion.

An odds ratio forchild parasitaemia of 5.8 (95% CI, 1.0 –32.5, P= 0.042) was associated with active placental infection but was higher for parasitaemia and/or recent malaria treatment (OR 10.0, 95% CI, 1.8 –56.2, P= 0.008). Past placental malaria infection also predicted child parasitaemia and/orrecent malaria treatment (OR 10.3, 95% CI 2.2 –48,P= 0.003).Malaria parasitaemia at ANC1 marginally increased the risk of childhood parasitaemia (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0 –4.3, P= 0.063).In children, parasitaemia risk was higher with evidence of maternal inflammation based on raised CRP (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1 –3.9,P= 0.020) in the third trimester.Chorioamnionitis at delivery was associated with reducedrisk of child parasitaemia ( P= 0.038), although for child parasitaemia or recent malaria treatment this reduction was not significant.
4|DISCUSSION Periconceptional iron supplementation made no difference to pla- cental malaria parasite prevalence, or in children, to malaria-related outcomes or iron biomarker values. When combining trial arms,increased malaria infection prevalence was seen in children with better iron status.There was increased childhood malaria infectionrisk following active and past placental malaria, indicating that ear-lier gestational malaria was also a risk factor for malaria in young children, although the active infection had cleared by the time of delivery.The absence of a difference in child malaria outcomes or iron sta- tus by trial arm is consistent with the findings that periconceptional iron supplementation did not improve maternal iron status.
There wasgood adherence to weekly supplementation (79% iron; 80% control; Gies et al., 2018), and the lack of effect of maternal iron supplementa- tion was attributed to poor maternal iron absorption due to the highprevalence (>40%) of chronic untreated asymptomatic malaria para- sitaemias (Brabin, Tinto, & Roberts, 2019). In principle screening for iron deficiency, prevalence would be implemented before introductionof routine supplementation programmes.WHO in 2020 suggestedthat a prevalence of 5 –19.9% iron deficiency, based on ferritin con- centrations, might be considered a mild public health problem (World Health Organisation, 2020).Based on adjusted ferritin alone(<15 μgL −1), prevalence at ANC1 in our study was 12.8% (Diallo et al., 2020).Using BIS as an indicator, 16% of mothers in the last FIGURE 2 Age-specific child iron biomarkers and malaria parasitaemia.

Malaria parasite prevalence (with or without prior treatment) and RDT positivity in children were, with the exception of ZPP, strongly associated with biomarkers of betteriron status and iron repletion at all ages (Table 3). ZPP concentra-tion was higher in children with malaria, but its specificity in chil- dren, as well as in pregnant women, is reduced secondary to the anaemia of inflammation (Asobayire, Adou, Davidson, Cook, &Hurrell, 2001; Senga, Koshy, & Brabin, 2012; Stoltzfus et al., 2000).Preterm delivery and low birthweight lead to higher iron require- ments for growth and are factors likely to contribute to the highprevalence of iron deficiency and anaemia in children older than 6 months in this area (Brabin, Gies, et al., 2019; Domellöf, 2017).Malaria contributes an added risk for anaemia and infection hadbeen experienced by approximately 80% of children reaching 6 months of age.
Comparable high iron deficiency and anaemia prevalence has been reported in the Eastern region of Burkina Fasoin children 6 –12 months of age (Bliznashka, Arsenault, Becquey, Ruel, & Olney, 2020). An early peak in malaria prevalence occurred at around 4 months of age followed by uniformly rising prevalence with increasing age.Anearly peak in prevalence was similarly associated with placental infec- tion in a cohort of Cameroonian children (Le Hesran et al., 1997).However in a cross-sectional survey an early peak may be an artefact since age reflects intensity and cumulative exposure to malaria.Chil- dren at 4 months may have had more exposure (almost a full seasonat the time of the survey), compared with younger children who have had less exposure, and older ones who have developed some acquired immunity from a previous season's exposure (Natama, Rovira-Val-lbona, Somé, et al., 2018).
This would occur in children of mothers with and without placental malaria, so does not explain the higher malaria prevalence in those with placental malaria. A recent meta-analysis of 11 studies found an overall malaria risk in young children(adjusted hazard ratio 1.46, 95% CI 1.07 –2.0, P< 0.001) associated with malaria in pregnancy but via indeterminate mechanisms (Park et al., 2020).Placental malaria may influence primarily risk for the firstinfant malaria episode (Bouaziz et al., 2018; Le Hesran et al., 1997; Le Port et al., 2011), and better child iron status could increase subse- quent malaria risk (Georgiadou et al., 2019) and possibly risk ofnonmalarial infections (Natama, Rovira-Vallbona, Sorgho, et al., 2018; Rachas et al., 2012).Malaria risk in young children is also influenced by other mater- nal factors, although this study found no association with gesta- tional age, use of IPTp, SGA or child undernutrition.
Evidence for an association between IPT in pregnancy and malaria in infants is lim-ited (Kakuru, Staedke, Dorsey, Rogerson, & Chandramohan, 2019).Higher malaria risk has been reported in a single study of SGA infants, but gestational age was not assessed by ultrasound and the difference was marginal (Agbota, Polman, et al., 2019). Maternal – fetal immunological interactions are important (Feeney, 2020; Jagannathan, 2018).Innate immune modulation by placental malaria FIGURE 3 Child malaria infection prevalence by placental malaria category.Red line: active placental malaria present; blue line: past placental malaria present; green line: no placental malaria present.(a) Rapid diagnostic test positive, (b) malaria parasitaemia positive and (c) malariaparasitaemia positive and/or recent treatment for malaria.Active indicates acute infection (only parasites and minimal haemozoin deposition inthe macrophages but not fibrin) and chronic infection (parasites and haemozoin deposition).

Rugs along the axes indicate the positive (upper axis) and negative (lower axis) caseGIES ET AL.9o f1 3bs_bs_banner is described in infants from this study area in Burkina Faso (Natama, Moncunill, et al., 2018).Immunological interactions are especiallyrelevant in primigravidae who are at increased risk of malaria in high transmission areas.In the present study, all women were primigravidae and more than 90% were adolescent (Brabinet al., 2020).The lower risk of child malaria observed in this study with chorioamnionitis may be attributable to treatment of related maternal symptoms of vaginal discharge from genital infection withmetronidazole, which has antimalarial effects and hence could reduce placental parasite load (Pallangyo, Minjas, & Sarda, 1986).
Metronidazole for lower genital infections with vaginal dischargewas available free of charge both before and during pregnancy and8.2% reported a discharge at least once during pregnancy (Brabin et al., 2017; background data, Appendix S1). Lack of adjustment for malaria transmission intensity is an important limitation of the present study, as for nearly all published studies, which may be confounded by shared maternal and child exposures to infected mosquitoes (Kakuru, Staedke, Dorsey,Rogerson, & Chandramohan, 2019).Adolescent malaria has been associated with high gametocyte prevalence in Burkina Faso, which would influence the reproductive rate and infection transmission(Ouédraogo et al., 2010).Malaria infection risk could relate to an effect of ferritin supply on gametocyte fecundity and parasite ontogeny in the mosquito (Geiser, Conley, Elliott, Mayo, &Winzerling, 2015).
If mosquitos have higher malaria gametocyterates (enhanced by better iron substrates in their blood meal), then the reproduction rate of malaria transmission increases. This would impact on the local mosquito population and increase malariainfant exposures.For this reason, infants of a largely iron replete adolescent population could be at increased malaria infection risk.Younger women may also provide different child care prac-tices than older mothers which may impact their child's malaria exposure and treatment.Iron requirements for adolescent growth and for pregnancy and neonatal iron are competing factors(Young et al., 2010), which underlines the need for longitudinalstudies of infection risk characterising iron biomarkers from preconception.No previous studies have longitudinally assessed both maternal and child iron status as determining factors for childhood infection risk in areas of high malaria transmission.
Lack of efficacy of the pri- mary intervention in mothers precluded better understanding of theeffects of supplementation on the iron status of their offspring. Strengths of the present study include assessment of gestational age by ultrasound, lack of confounding due to maternal parity orage, inclusion of key determinants of maternal and child malaria and completion of this cross-sectional survey during the peak month of malaria transmission (Natama et al., 2018).The findings should begeneralizable to comparable areas with high malaria transmission.Alimitation was the reduced sample size for the child survey.This was predicated by the primary safety trial endpoints in mothers and the requirement to complete the survey during the peak malariatransmission month.
The sample size for the child safety survey was reduced due to perinatal losses (Gies et al., 2018), as well asmigration outside the study area which contributed to failure to attend for delivery, or led to postnatal migration and failure toattend for the child survey. Mobility was high among girls as they married and moved to join their husbands in nonstudy areas (Campaoré, Gies, Brabin, Tinto, & Brabin, 2018).Village deliveriesand those occurring en route to the hospital reduced placental biopsy samples.Attrition and child nutritional and age profiles were equivalent between trial arms.5|CONCLUSIONS High prevalence of placental and child malaria was associated with better iron status in young mothers and children.Intensified efforts are needed to reduce risk of placental malaria which should, in turn,reduce risk of malaria and anaemia in young children.
