Vitamin B6 (VB 6) exhibits therapeutic e ﬀects towards autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but its speci ﬁc mechanism is poorly understood. Rat dams were treated with VB6standard, VB6deﬁciency, or VB6supplementary diet, and the same treatment was provided to their o ﬀspring, with their body weights monitored.Three-chambered social test and open ﬁeld test were employed to evaluate the e ﬀect of VB6on autism-like behaviors.Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) generation and synaptic inhibition of neurons in the hippocampus of rat were detected via immuno ﬂuorescence staining, followed by the measurement of GABA concentration through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).The role of VB6in the autophagy and apoptosis of cells was determined via Western blot and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL).
In orderto conduct rescue experiments, the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) or the activation of GABA was achieved by drug administration to the o ﬀspring rats with VB 6deﬁciency. As a result, no evident di ﬀerence in weight was observed in the o ﬀspring with varied VB6treatments.VB6deﬁciency impaired social interaction; aggravated self-grooming and bowel frequency; decreased GABA concentration, VIAAT, GAD67, vGAT expressions, and LC3 II/LC3 I ratio; increased p62level and p-mTOR/mTOR ratio; and promoted cell apoptosis.Inhibition of mTOR reversed the e ﬀect of VB 6deﬁciency on cell autophagy.GABA activation or mTOR inhibition o ﬀset the role of VB6deﬁciency in autism-like behaviors and hippocampal GABA expression.Collectively, VB6deﬁciency induces autism-like behaviors in rats by regulating mTOR-mediated autophagy in the hippocampus.1.
Introduction Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive neurodeve- lopmental disease with core symptoms of impaired socialinteraction, repetitive stereotypical behaviors, and narrowinterests [1 –3]. Unfortunately, there is no e ﬀective treatment for ASD, and children with this disease have poor socialadaptability, bringing great emotional and economic burdensto society and families, which, therefore, has aroused wide-spread attention.It is believed that ASD is caused by a combi- nation of both polygenic genetic and external environmental factors.Pathogenetically, during early embryonic develop-ment, patients with ASD are a ﬀected by a variety of factors that impair neuronal function and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA)ergic synaptic transmission, which in turn in ﬂuence the balance of excitatory/inhibitory signal ratio, leading toautism-like behaviors [4].
Interneuronal GABAergic disor-ders have been observed in many animal models of ASD.Thus, repairing the dysfunction of the GABA system isthought to be an important way to alleviate ASD [5]. As an essential nutrient for the body, vitamin makes a profound impact upon the development and function ofthe brain and nervous system [6].In recent years, multiplevitamins have been proved to alleviate ASD, including vita- min A (VA), VB 6, and VD [7, 8].VB6, a pyridine derivative, works as a coenzyme factor in diverse metabolic reactions ofthe human body, including amino acid metabolism, syn-thesis and breakdown of neurotransmitters, regulation ofHindawi Behavioural Neurology Volume 2023, Article ID 6991826, 12 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/6991826 steroid hormone activity, and control of gene expression [9, 10].Although the combination therapy using VB6has been reported to be applied for ASD at present [11], knowledgegaps on its speci ﬁc mechanism remain.
However, existing research suggests that it might be associated with the abilityof VB 6to strengthen the neurotransmitter system [12, 13]. Autophagy is a process of transporting misfolded pro- teins or damaged cell organelles, dysfunctional mitochon-dria, for instance, through autophagic vesicles to lysosomes for degradation [14].Autophagy is a pivotal mechanism for cells to maintain homeostasis, the imbalance of whichin neurons is usually linked to cerebral diseases, includingASD and neurodegenerative diseases [15 –18].Previous stud- ies have pointed out that disruption of mammalian target ofrapamycin (mTOR)-regulated macroautophagy and autoph-agy leads to autism-like abnormalities [19, 20].Recently, ithas been additionally demonstrated that enhancingmTOR-mediated autophagy contributes to the restorationof GABAergic signaling [21], which might alleviate autism-like behaviors in rats [22].
Three regions of the adult brain, the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, and hippocampal dentate gyrus, contain newborn neurons that are crucial players in the natural func-tional circuits [23]. Many neurodegenerative diseases andneurodevelopmental disorders involving cognitive impair-ment may be associated with hippocampal dysfunction,which is at least partially attributable to adult neurogeneticdisorders [24].A recent review stated that hippocampusmay represent an important component within a system ofchanged brain regions that work in tandem to contributeto the phenotype of ASD [25].Moreover, VA de ﬁciency induces autistic-like behaviors in rats through modulatingthe RAR β-CD38-oxytocin axis in the hypothalamus [26].Thus, the hippocampus was chosen for the study of VB 6in ASD.
In this study, to suss out the role of VB6in ASD, we ﬁrstly constructed the models in the o ﬀspring rat with VB6 deﬁciency or VB6supplement and then explored whether the mechanism of VB6in ASD was associated with mTOR- mediated autophagy, with the aim to provide new insightinto the pathogenesis of ASD. 2.Material and Methods 2.1.Animals.The surgical procedures with animals in this study were approved by the Committee of Zhejiang BaiyueBiotech Co., Ltd for Experimental Animals Welfare (approval number: ZJBYLA-IACUC-20220701) and per- formed in accordance with Guide for the Care and Use ofLaboratory Animals.A total of 24 virgin female Wistar rats(120 –135 g) were purchased from Charles River Labs (Bei- jing, China) and were group-housed in standard animalcages ( 25 ± 2 °C) with consistent 12/12 hours light/dark cycle.2.2.Modeling.Autistic rat models with VB6deﬁciency or VB6supplement were constructed using the o ﬀspring of female Wistar rats as previously described [12].
Based on abasic diet, all female rats were randomly fed with 0, 6, or30 mg VB 6(P5669, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)for 4 weeks.During the pregnancy and lactation, in consis- tent with the grouping of their mother rats, the rats werecontinued to be given aforementioned VB 6treatments.After weaning, new pups (male) were collected and divided intothe three groups: Control group ( n=6, a basic diet with 6m g V B 6), VB6deﬁciency group ( n=2 4, a basic diet with- out VB6), and VB6supplement group ( n=6, a basic diet with 30 mg VB6).The body weight of o ﬀspring rats was recorded from postnatal day 1 (PND 1) to PND 42.The o ﬀ- spring rats between PND 42 and PND 56 were subjected to the behavioral tests.The mother rats were sacri ﬁced by cer- vical dislocation under anesthesia (40 mg/kg, pentobarbitalsodium, P-010, Sigma-Aldrich, USA).2.3.Drug Administration.
GABA receptor agonist Clonaze- pam (C-907, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and mTOR inhibitorNVP-BEZ235 (A10133, Adooq Bioscience, China) were usedfor drug administration in vivo . A total of 18 o ﬀspring rats were randomly selected from the abovementioned VB 6deﬁ- ciency group and assigned into a new VB6deﬁciency group (a basic diet without VB6), VB6deﬁciency + Clonazepam group (intraperitoneal injection of 0.025 mg/kg Clonazepam based on the VB6deﬁciency diet), and VB6deﬁciency + NVP-BEZ235 group (intraperitoneal injection of 400 μg/ kg NVP-BEZ235 based on the VB6deﬁciency diet), with six rats in each group.All o ﬀspring rats in this experiment were reared for 42 –56 days since PND 1, and the drug administra- tion was implemented 30 minutes prior to the behavioraltests [20, 22].2.4.Behavioral Tests 2.4.1.Three-Chambered Social Test.A three-chambered apparatus (XR-XJ117) purchased from XinRuan Informa- tion Technology (Shanghai, China) was applied to conductsociability test [22].
After 10-minute habituation, the o ﬀ- spring rats (PND 42 and PND 56) with or without the indi-cated treatment of VB 6or drugs above were individually placed into the center chamber of the apparatus and allowedto access three chambers for 10 minutes, with an identicalcage in each side of the chamber, one of which containedan unacquainted rat. The time the o ﬀspring rats spent in each chamber was automatically recorded.2.4.2.Open Field Test.The locomotor activity of the o ﬀ- spring rats (PND 42 and PND 56) with or without the indi- cated treatment of VB 6or drugs above was evaluated via the open ﬁeld test with the assistance of an uncovered box (100 × 100 × 50 cm, XR-XZ301, XinRuan Information Tech- nology, China).The box was cleaned thoroughly and steril-ized with 75% alcohol (E299578, Aladdin, China) beforethe tests to eliminate any odors.The open ﬁeld test was car- ried out according to the previous instructions [26].
Brie ﬂy, the oﬀspring rats were individually placed into the center of the open ﬁeld and allowed to explore the new environment without any disturbance for 15 minutes during the test.The SuperMaze software (vision 2.0, XR-Xmaze, XinRuan Information Technology, China) was applied to monitor movement speed, self-grooming time, and bowel frequencyautomatically during the test.2 Behavioural Neurology After behavioral test, all o ﬀspring rats were sacri ﬁced by cervical dislocation under anesthesia, and the hippocampaltissues were harvested and stored in liquid nitrogen at−80 °C for follow-up experiments. The right hemisphere was used for immunocytochemistry and terminal deoxynu-cleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)experiments, while the hippocampus from the other hemi-sphere was utilized for Western blot.The hippocampal tis-sues from both hemispheres were employed for high- performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay.
The experimental design was described in SupplementaryFigure 1. 2.5.Immuno ﬂuorescence Analysis.The frozen hippocampal tissues were cut into sections with a thickness of 5 μma n d ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde (P0099, Beyotime, China) for 15minutes.After being washed with phosphate bu ﬀered saline (PBS, P1022, Solarbio, China), the sections were subjected to15 minute treatment with Triton X-100 (T8200, Solarbio,China) and 1 hour blocking using 5% goat serum (abs933, Absin, China).To determine the expressions of vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) and glutamatedecarboxylase 67 (GAD67) in hippocampal CA3 area, the sec-tions were incubated with primary antibodies against VIAAT(1 : 1000, ab101934, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and GAD67(10μg/ml, ab26116, Abcam, UK) at 4 °C overnight away from light.
Then, the sections underwent 1 hour incubation with sec-ondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488-labeled Goat Anti-RabbitIgG (1 : 1000, P0176, Beyotime, China) and Alexa Fluor 647-labeled Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (1 : 1000, P0191, Beyotime,China) at room temperature. After 5 minute counterstain with2-(4-amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride (DAPI, C1005, Beyotime, China), ﬂuorescent images were cap- tured using a confocal microscope (LSM 780, ZEISS, Ger-many) at ×600 magni ﬁcation.To detect colocalization between GAD67 positivity (GAD67 +) with vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid trans- porter (vGAT) in hippocampal CA3 area, the sections werepre-treated with Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum as aboveand then were cultivated with primary antibodies againstGAD67 and vGAT (1 : 500, 131006, Synaptic Systems, Ger-many) at 4 °C overnight in the dark.
The next day, the sec- tions were cultured with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor488-Labeled Goat anti-Mouse IgG (1 : 1000, P0188, Beyo- time, China) and Alexa Fluor 680-labeled Donkey Anti- Chicken IgG (1 : 100, 703-625-155, Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA), followed by DAPI staining. Lastly, a confo-cal microscope was used to observe the stained sectionsunder ×400 magni ﬁcation.For investigating the activity of GABA +in hippocampal CA3 area from hemispheres of VB6-deﬁcient o ﬀspring rats with or without drug administration, the pre-treated sec-tions were cultured with primary antibody targeting GABA(1 : 2000, ab8891, Abcam, UK) at 4 °C overnight without light, followed by the cultivation with Alexa Fluor 647- labeled Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG Secondary Antibody (P0180, Beyotime, China) at room temperature for 1 hour.Afterthe staining with DAPI, ﬂuorescent images were obtained by a microscope at ×100 magni ﬁcation.
A total of threehippocampal hemispheres from six consecutive serial sec- tions were used. 2.6.HPLC Assay.The content of GABA in the hippocampi of rats from Control, VB 6deﬁciency, and VB6supplement groups was measured by HPLC assay.In brief, the hippo-campal tissues from both hemispheres were homogenizedin perchlorate solution (0.04 M, abs47048087, Absin, China)on ice, subsequent to which 15-minute centrifugation was carried out.Then, the supernatants were neutralized with potassium bicarbonate solution (2 M, abs42025446, Absin,China).After centrifugation, 2 ml supernatant of the sampleor standard GABA solution was treated with triethylamine-acetonitrile (1 ml, 1/10, v/v) and phenyl isothiocyanate(PITC) acetonitrile (1 ml, 1/25, v/v) at room temperaturefor 1 hour away from light, followed by 20 minute n-hex- ane treatment (2 ml, H100107, Aladdin, China).
Follow-ing the ﬁltration, the lower layer solution (1 ml) was h a r v e s t e df o ra n a l y s i s .H P L Cw a sc o n d u c t e du n d e ra nAgilent 1100 HPLC system (A gilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to analyze the content of GABA according to the previous protocols [22]. A ssay for each sample was repeated twice.2.7.Western Blot.The levels of autophagy-related proteins in the brain tissues from rats in VB 6deﬁciency group with or without drug administration, VB6supplement group, and Control group were measured via Westernblot.After the extraction of total protein with RIPA LysisBuﬀer (E-BC-R327, Elabscience, China), BCA Protein Assay Kit (23225, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) wasused to detect protein concentration in the collected superna- tant following the instructions.
Afterwards, equal amount of protein (50 μg/lane) was separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, E-IR-R305, Elabscience, China) and loaded onto nitrocellulose mem-branes (2215, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Next, the mem-branes were sequentially treated with blocking bu ﬀer at room temperature for 1 hour and cultiv ated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight.The next day, the membranes were rinsed with tris-bu ﬀered saline with Tween-20 (TBS-T, abs952, Absin, China) and incubated with secondary antibody at room tem-perature for 2 hours.For the visualization of immunoblots,the protein bands were added with PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (34577, ThermoFisher, USA) and developed in a Tanon 5200 Imaging System (Shanghai, China).
All antibodieswere obtained from Abcam (UK), and the primary antibodieswere those against LC3 I/LC3 II (1/1000, 14 kDa, 16 kDa,ab192890), p62 (1/10000, 62 kDa, ab109012), mTOR (1/1000,250 kDa, ab32028), phosphor (p)-mTOR (1/1000, 289 kDa,ab109268), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(GAPDH, 0.1 μg/ml, 36 kDa, ab9484). The secondary anti- bodies consisted of Rabbit Anti-Mouse IgG (1/2000, ab6728)and Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (1/3000, ab6721).2.8.TUNEL Assay.Cell apoptosis in CA1 and CA3 areas of rat hippocampus from Control, VB 6deﬁciency, and VB6sup- plement groups was determined using Colorimetric TUNELApoptosis Assay Kit (C1091, Beyotime, China).The frozen3 Behavioural Neurology hippocampal sections were treated with Immunol Staining Fix Solution (P0098, Beyotime, China) at room temperaturefor 30 minutes, followed by the rinse using PBS twice.
Then,each section was immersed into Enhanced Immunostaining Per-meabilization Bu ﬀer (P0097, Beyotime, China) for 5 minutes, blocked with 0.3% H 2O2in PBS for 20 minutes, and reacted with 50μl prepared biotin-labeled solution at 37°C in a wet box for 1 hour without light. After the reaction was terminated, the sec-tions were subjected to color development, including the treat- ment of both streptavidin –horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (50μl) and 3,3 ′-diaminobenzidine (DAB, 0.2 ml) according to the manufacturer ’s speci ﬁcation.Following dehydration with gradient alcohol and hyalinization with xylene, the number ofpositively apoptotic cells in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 bycells/0.01 mm 2was counted using a light microscope ( ×100 mag- niﬁcation, CX23, Olympus, Japan).Three hippocampal hemi- spheres from six consecutive serial sections were used.2.9.Statistical Analysis.The results of triplicate assays were expressed as mean ±standard deviation.
Kolmogorov – Smirnov test was used to verify normality. One-way analy-sis of variance was used for multi-group comparison,followed by Tukey or Dunnett ’spost-hoc test to detect any inter-group di ﬀerences.Statistical analyses were real- ized using Graphpad Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad Soft-ware Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).P<0 :05indicated the data were statistically signi ﬁcant.3.Results 3.1.VB6Deﬁciency Reduced Sociability and Aggravated Anxiety-Related Behaviors of O ﬀspring Rats.No abnormal deaths or loss were observed in all rats during this study.To explore the role of VB 6in rats with autism-like behaviors, we obtained the o ﬀspring from pregnant rats to construct rat model with VB6normality, VB6deﬁciency, or VB6supple- ment.As exhibited in weight curves (Figure 1(a)), no obvi-ous di ﬀerence was reported concerning the weight of the oﬀspring rats among the control, VB 6deﬁciency, and VB6 supplement groups.
Subsequently, we investigated whether VB6has an e ﬀect on autism-like behaviors of rats. The eval- uation of social interactions demonstrated that when com- pared to the control group, in VB6deﬁciency group, the oﬀspring rats had fewer social interactions with unfamiliar rats but more interactions with the object, and in VB6sup- plement group, the o ﬀspring rats had more social interac- tions with unfamiliar rats and less interactions with theobject (Figure 1(b), p<0 :05).In line with the open ﬁeld test results, we observed that VB 6deﬁciency and VB6sup- plement exerted no e ﬀect on movement speed of the o ﬀ- spring rats (Figure 1(c)), while VB6deﬁciency increased self-grooming time and bowel frequency (Figures 1(d)and 1(e), p<0 :01).3.2.VB 6Deﬁciency Diminished Synaptic Inhibition in the Hippocampi of Rats.The immuno ﬂuorescence analysis was conducted to reveal the e ﬀect of VB6on synaptic inhibition of neurons in the hippocampus of o ﬀspring rats.
As illustrated in Figure 2, the density of VIAAT and GAD67 ﬂuorescencesignals was lessened in hippocampal CA3 area of the o ﬀ- spring rats with VB6deﬁciency, and no remarkable change was observed in the o ﬀspring rats with VB6sup- plement. Additionally, the hippocampal CA3 area of o ﬀ- spring rats with VB6deﬁciency exhibited conspicuously decreased GAD67+and vGAT, while no signi ﬁcant change was visible in the o ﬀspring rats with VB6supple- ment (Figure 3).Moreover, the results of HPLC assayrevealed that the concentration of GABA was dwindled in the hippocampus of o ﬀspring rats in VB 6deﬁciency group, compared to that in Control group (Figure 4(a),p<0 :001).3.3.VB 6Deﬁciency Suppressed Autophagy and Accelerated Apoptosis of Neurons in the O ﬀspring Rats.
Considering that the imbalance of autophagy is closely associated with cerebraldiseases including autism [15], Western blot was employed formeasuring the protein levels of LC3 I, LC3 II, p62, mTOR,and p-mTOR in the hippocampal tissues. As compared withthose in Control group, decreased LC3 II/LC3 I ratio andincreased p-mTOR/mTOR ratio and p62 protein level were observed in the o ﬀspring rats in VB 6deﬁciency group, while increased LC3 II/LC3 I ratio was observed in the o ﬀspring rats in VB6supplement group (Figures 4(b), 4(c), 4(d), and 4(e), p<0 :001).We also detected cell apoptosis in hippo- campal CA1 and CA3 areas using TUNEL assay.Notably,more cell apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 area emergedin VB 6deﬁciency group, while less apoptotic cells appeared in VB6supplement group (Figures 4(f) and 4(g), p<0 :001).In addition, VB6deﬁciency or VB6supplement generated no signi ﬁcant e ﬀect on cell apoptosis in the hippocampal C A 3a r e a( F i g u r e s4 ( h )a n d4 ( i ) ) .3.4.
The Role of VB6in the Autism-Like Behaviors of Rats Was Mediated by mTOR Inhibition and GABA Activation.It has been suggested that the role of mTOR-mediatedautophagy in the development of autism might be correlatedwith GABA [22]. Hence, we triggered mTOR inhibition orGABA activation in the o ﬀspring rats with VB 6deﬁciency by drug administration with NVP-BEZ235 or Clonazepamand conducted rescue assays.The results of three-chambered social test unveiled that both NVP-BEZ235 andClonazepam promoted social interaction of the o ﬀspring rats with VB 6deﬁciency, compared to those without drug administration (Figure 5(a), p<0 :001).As demonstrated in Figures 5(b), 5(c), and 5(d), neither NVP-BEZ235 nor Clo-nazepam signally in ﬂuenced the movement speed, and VB 6 deﬁciency-induced increments in self-grooming time and bowel frequency were dwindled by both NVP-BEZ235 andClonazepam ( p<0 :05).
At molecular level, NVP-BEZ235 increased LC3 II/LC3 I ratio, decreased p-mTOR/mTORratio, and down-regulated p62 protein level, which reversedthe eﬀects of VB 6deﬁciency (Figures 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), and 6(d), p<0 :001). No observable e ﬀect of Clonazepam, how- ever, was detected on LC3 II/LC3 I ratio, p-mTOR/mTOR ratio, and p62 protein level (Figures 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), and 6(d)).Interestingly, the results of immuno ﬂuorescence stain- ing demonstrated that both NVP-BEZ235 and Clonazepamenhanced GABA +in the hippocampi of the o ﬀspring rats4 Behavioural Neurology with VB6deﬁciency, compared to those without drug administration (Figure 6(e)).Finally, a scheme showing the roles of VB6, GABA transmission, mTOR, and apoptosis in the proposed mechanism of the autism etiology was pre-sented in Supplementary Figure 2.4.

It can be con-cluded that VB 6deﬁciency indeed participates in the devel- opment of ASD, anxiety, and cognitive behaviors inparticular. Nevertheless, its regulatory mechanism in this process has not been fully understood.Since VB 6can promote amino acid absorption and protein synthesis, catalyze the conversion of glutamate into GABA, andinhibit the central nervous system, it is often used clinically totreat epilepsy, isoniazid accumu lation-induced central nervous system (CNS) excitation, an d peripheral neuritis [29 –31].The deﬁciency of behavioral ﬂexibility frequently observed in patients with ASD may be, at least in part, due to the inade-quate control of GABAergic transmission by the regulatory sys-tem.
GABA, produced by GABAergic inhibitory interneurons,is an important inhibitory transmitter in the CNS, and its down-regulation can cause dysfunction of central neurotrans- mitters, which results in delayed brain response, distraction,and emotional variability, thus a ﬀecting social interaction ofpatients with ASD [32 –34]. The study of Almeida et al.indi- cated that the appearance of GABA neurotransmitter perturba-tions in the o ﬀspring may be attributed to maternal VB 6 deﬁciency [12].The above ﬁndings enlightened us that the repair of GABA system via VB6could be a potential mecha- nism in alleviating ASD.Excitation/inhibition synaptic imbal- ance is considered as one of the most dominantneurophysiological features of ASD [35].Synapses are special-ized structures that connect and transmit between neurons orbetween neurons and e ﬀector cells, and their structural and quantitative integrity ensure the normal brain function.
It hasbeen shown that GABA is critica l in regulating feedback and feedforward inhibition of neuronal excitability [36].

VIAAT, as a marker of GABAergic presynaptic elements, is responsible for the uptakeand transport of GABA from the synaptic gap to the synapticvesicles to regulate the concentration of GABA in the synapticgap and terminate inhibitory synaptic transmission. Theexpression level of VIAAT directly re ﬂects the strength of syn- aptic transmission [39].Our ﬁndings identi ﬁed that VB 6deﬁ- ciency impaired the production of GABA and reducesinhibitory synapses, thus enhan cing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters from neuro ns, which may be an underlying mechanism of autism-like behaviors in rats.LC3 is the most important marker during autophagy and is primarily involved in the formation of autophagosomes.p62 acts as a link between ubiquitinated proteins and LC3to promote the degradation of autophagy.
Numerous researches have revealed that the abnormally initiated autophagy-related pathways result in reduced autophagic activity, which is associated with the development of ASD[15, 40, 41]. Hui et al.unraveled that autophagy de ﬁciency in the hippocampus contributes to the formation ofSQSTM1/p62-positive aggregates, thereby compromise thetransport function of GABA Areceptors [21].mTOR is a critical downstream signaling molecule of adenosine 5 ′- monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)and plays a negative regulatory role in the autophagy of cells.The research by Zhang et al.con ﬁrmed that autophagy acts as a link between mTOR and GABA signaling, and that mTOR inhibition promotes PI3K/AKT/mTOR-mediated autophagic activity, thereby enhancing social interaction inautistic rats [20].

Collectively, it was indi- cated that the inhibition of mTOR activated autophagy todown-regulate the protein level of p62, thus mitigatingthe dysfunction of GABA receptor caused by isolation ofSQSTM1/p62-positive aggregates.In conclusion, based on in vivo experiments, our current study authenticates that VB 6deﬁciency induces autism-like behaviors in rats by regulating mTOR-mediated autophagy,which provides a new mechanism of ASD.However, the absence of in vitro experiments is a shortcoming in this study.Data Availability The analyzed data sets generated during the study are avail-able from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no con ﬂicts of interest.Authors ’Contributions Lijuan Chen and Jing Li contributed equally to this work.Acknowledgments We thank the picture materials (Supplementary Figure 2) by Figdraw (www.ﬁgdraw.com).
