There is a continued need for the advancement of natural emulsi ﬁers to replace synthetic emulsi ﬁers, driven by human health concerns. This study is aimed at producing protein-polysaccharide conjugates through the Maillard reaction and at evaluating its ability as an emulsi ﬁer based on its emulsifying properties.The proteins used in this study were bovine milk whey protein and soy protein isolates, while the polysaccharides were maltodextrin and pectin.The protein-polysaccharide conjugation useda Maillard reaction under dry heating conditions.The protein and polysaccharide mass ratios were 1 : 2 and 1 : 3.The resultsshowed that the types of proteins and polysaccharides and their mass a ﬀect the surface tension of the conjugate products.Whey protein-pectin conjugates with a mass ratio of 1 : 2 and a concentration of 1% had the lowest surface tension at 43.77 dyne/cm 2.This conjugate sample also showed the highest emulsifying index at 27.20 m2/g.
The conjugate powder containing pectin as a polysaccharide showed better emulsifying activity than that of those containing maltodextrin. However, the smallestdroplet size of the emulsion (256.5 nm) resulted from the emulsi ﬁcation process using whey protein-maltodextrin conjugates as an emulsi ﬁer.The FTIR and gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis con ﬁrmed the conjugation formation.In general, protein-polysaccharide conjugates containing whey protein could potentially act as a natural emulsi ﬁer for food.1.Introduction Emulsions are widely used in the manufacturing processes of several industries, including the food, pharmaceutical, andnonfood sectors, such as paints, textiles, pesticides, andmetal cutting ﬂuids [1].Generating a stable emulsion requires the input of energy [2].Moreover, the use of supple-mentary surface-active compounds or emulsi ﬁers is war- ranted.
In general, emulsi ﬁers used in food processing are synthetic, including fatty alcohol ethoxylates [3], sorbitanesters [4], and sucrose esters [5]. Synthetic emulsi ﬁers may have potential toxicity to human health [6].It is widely acknowledged that natural emulsi ﬁers possess enhanced safety attributes and contribute to the improved acceptabil-ity of food products among consumers [7].Due to these fac-tors, there has been an increased focus on researching theadvancement of natural emulsi ﬁer manufacturing.Proteins and polysaccharides are among the natural emulsi ﬁers applied in the food industry [8].The bovine milk whey protein is a waste product of the cheese and casein industry.The whey protein containsaround 7-11% protein consisting of β-lactoglobulin, α-lact- albumin, bovine serum albumin, bovine lactoferrin, andimmunoglobulins.
Further puri ﬁcation of whey protein will produce whey protein isolate (WPI) and whey protein con-centrate (WPC), which have more than 90% protein content.Other components of whey protein are lactose, carbohy-drates, fat, and cholesterol, which are negligible in WPI [9]. In addition to essential nutrients, whey protein has func- tional properties such as water binding, gelling, emulsifying,foaming, and chelating capacities [9, 10].These propertiesallow whey protein to act as an emulsi ﬁer.Wiley International Journal of Food Science Volume 2024, Article ID 3254132, 21 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/3254132 Proteins and polysaccharides have properties that can emulsify and stabilise the emulsion.The amphiphilic natureof protein components can be used as an emulsi ﬁer to help reduce interfacial tension and stabilise the oil/water interface[11].Protein exhibits sensitivity to pH variations, ionicstrength, and temperature as a naturally occurring emulsi-ﬁer.
Dickinson [12] revealed that most polysaccharides have a stabilising ability by continuously forming tissue, making ithighly viscous, enabling it to create a gel [13]. Combining both under certain conditions (concentration, protein- polysaccharide ratio, pH, ionic strength, and temperature)is a strategy to improve the stability of the emulsion [14].The conjugation via the Maillard reaction is known to be induced by dry or wet heating.However, the dry heatingmethod is more widely studied and has a higher reactioneﬃciency than the wet method [15].The formation of con- jugation occurs through a covalent linkage establishedbetween the carbonyl group present in the polysaccharideand the amine group located in the protein [16].
The Mail-lard reaction is a thermal process that begins with the pro-duction of a Schi ﬀbase, proceeds with the generation of ketamine from the Maillard reaction through the rearrange- ment of Amadori, and culminates in the development ofmelanoidin, which is distinguished by its brown pigment[17]. Melanoidin formation sometimes leads to undesirableconditions, such as bitter taste and burning aroma [18].Several studies have demonstrated that the protein- polysaccharide conjugates enhance solubility and emulsify-ing capabilities to a greater extent than independent use ofprotein independently [19 –21].The formation of protein- polysaccharide conjugates is a ﬀected by the type and pro- portion of proteins and polysaccharides and processing con-ditions, including reaction time and temperature [17, 22].This study used whey protein and soy protein, representing animal and plant protein, respectively.
Furthermore, theuse of whey protein and soy protein isolate will increase theiradded values because these proteins are waste products fromthe processing of cheese and soybean oil, respectively [23,24]. According to Dammak et al.[6], there is a growingdesire to encourage the exploration of novel natural emulsi-ﬁers sourced from industrial food by-products, which exhibit superior e ﬃcacy.Soy proteins derived from soybeans have been used extensively employed in food products dueto their wide functional characteristics [25, 26].Soybeansinclude several globular proteins with surface-active proper- ties, which facilitate the creation of emulsions by lowering the interfacial tension between the oil and water phases.Diﬀerent types of protein-conjugated polysaccharides exhibit distinct impacts on the characteristics of the resultingconjugate product.
Pectin represents a type of polysaccha-ride with hydrophobic groups and surface activity, whilemaltodextrin belongs to hydrophilic polysaccharides and isnot surface active in an emulsion system [27]. Pectin is abranched polymer that has a linear backbone made up ofα-D-galacturonic acid units with 1 –4 linkages [28] obtained from various plant sources, most commonly citrus, apple, and beet [29], or extracted from food and beverage process- ing waste [30].According to Peng et al.[31], maltodextrinexhibits a restricted capacity for adsorption and stabilisationof emulsion due to its lack of hydrophobic surface-active properties.Maltodextrin is derived through the acid and reg-ulated enzymatic hydrolysis of starch, resulting in the forma-tion of D-glucose polymers connected by α-(1,4) and α-(1,6) links [32, 33].Maltodextrin is a stabiliser for oil-in-waterfood emulsions [34, 35].
A separate study has shown thatthe use of maltodextrin as a stabilising ingredient in oil-in-water emulsions can improve the physical stability of theemulsion [36]. Extensive research has been conducted on the maltodex- trin conjugate whey protein isolate, revealing its promisingcapabilities in the emulsi ﬁcation of eugenol [20].In addition, some studies have also been carried out on the conjugationof whey protein isolates with pectin [37].Conjugate formingusually uses whey protein isolate (WPI) with a protein con-tent of ±90%, while research that uses whey protein with 7- 11% of protein is still rare.Another fact is that the whey pro-tein isolate contains impurities such as lactose, which is alsothe case with the unre ﬁned bovine milk whey protein.According to Ding et al.[22], lactose as a contaminant inWPI does not a ﬀect the formation of covalent bonds between WPI and maltodextrin.
However, the e ﬀect of using whey protein in conjugation with polysaccharides is not yetknown considering the di ﬀerence in protein and impurity content. The successful formation of a conjugate based onwhey protein will provide economic bene ﬁts and improve the added value of whey protein.Research has also beenconducted on the conjugation of soy protein-maltodextrinthrough the Maillard reaction [38, 39].Studies to examinethe eﬀects of di ﬀerent types of pectin on the production of conjugates were undertaken by Guo et al.[40] between pec-tin and whey protein during dry heating conditions.TheMaillard reaction between soy protein and pectin derived from apple and citrus was investigated by Ma et al.[41].Nevertheless, conducting research in this ﬁeld is signi ﬁ- cant for acquiring optimal natural emulsi ﬁer products.In addition, the characteristics are contingent on the protein-polysaccharide ratio, process circumstances, and tempera-ture.
Proteins and polysaccharides are diverse, and the struc-tural characteristics of these molecules greatly in ﬂuence their emulsifying abilities. The objective of this study is twofold:ﬁrst, to generate a protein-polysaccharide conjugate product through the process of whey protein/soy protein conjugationwith maltodextrin/pectin through the dry heat Maillardreaction, and second, to evaluate and identify the optimal conjugate product based on its emulsifying properties.2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Materials.The polysaccharides employed in this study were maltodextrin (technical grade) and pectin (technicalgrade).The proteins used were bovine milk whey protein(Sigma, W1500) and technical grade soy protein.The essen-tial oil used for particle size measurement analysis was euge-nol (Sigma-Aldrich, W246700).Gel electrophoresis used Mini-Protean SFX, 4-15%, 15 Well, 10 μl, and the molecular weight protein marker was Precision Plus std dual proteinfrom Bio-Rad Laboratories.
The bu ﬀer solution for electro- phoresis was prepared by reacting 62.5 mM Tris-HCl2 International Journal of Food Science (Merck), 20% glycerol (Merck), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (Merck), and 0.05% bromophenol blue (Merck). The stain-ing used Coomassie brilliant blue G250 (Sigma-Aldrich).Other chemicals used were absolute ethanol (Merck) andglacial anhydrous acetic acid for analysis (Merck).2.2.Methods 2.2.1.Preparation of Protein-Polysaccharide Conjugates through Maillard Reaction.The protein-polysaccharide con- jugation method was adopted and modi ﬁed from the Akhtar and Dickinson method [19] and Shah et al.[20].The ﬂow diagram for the preparation of protein-polysaccharide con-jugates can be seen in Figure 1 and is described in detail asfollows.Protein (whey protein or soy protein) was dissolved in distilled water and stirred with a magnetic bar on a hot- plate magnetic stirrer at 350 rpm for 30 minutes until theprotein was completely dissolved.
Then, polysaccharide(maltodextrin or pectin) was added to the protein solutionaccording to the formulation determined. The protein-polysaccharide mass ratios used in this study were 1 : 2(40 : 80 g) and 1 : 3 (30 : 90 g), which were dissolved in1000 g of distilled water.Shah et al.[20] stated that a massratio of protein and polysaccharides of 1 : 2 produces conju-gates with the highest yield compared to mass ratios of 1 : 1and 2 : 1.In addition to that, Capar and Yalcin [42] con-cluded that a protein-polysaccharide mass ratio of 1 : 2 is the optimum condition to produce the maximum yield.The stirring process was carried out at a speed of 500 rpmfor 18 hours at room temperature (27-30 °C) for the hydra- tion process.The drying process was conducted using aspray dryer (Lab Plant Spray Dryer SD05) at an inlet tem-perature of 150 °C and an outlet temperature of 80-90°C, 0.4 kPa compressed air pressure, 10 ml/minute of feed rate,and 52 m 3/h of air ﬂow rate.
The use of temperatures above 150°C may damage the protein, considering that the dena- turation temperature of whey protein or beta-lactoglobulinwith low water content (aw 0.85-0.11) ranges from 96 to180 °C [43]. The spray-dried powder was heated in an oven cabinet at a temperature of 90°C for 2 hours for conjugation, and the Maillard reaction occurred.This research used thedry heating method, in which a mixture of protein powderand polysaccharides is heated at a speci ﬁc temperature [9, 15].The conjugate powders were collected in closed packag-ing and stored in the freezer (-12 °C) until characterised.There are four combinations of protein-polysaccharide con-jugates, namely, whey protein-maltodextrin (WPMD), wheyprotein-pectin (WPP), soy protein-maltodextrin (SPMD),and soy protein-pectin (SPP), and two mass ratios ofprotein-polysaccharide (1 : 2 and 1 : 3).2.3.Characterisation 2.3.1.Surface Tension Measurement.
The measurement of the surface tension was done using a tensiometer with theDu Nouy ring method. This technique relies on dragging an object with a clearly de ﬁned geometry from the liquid surface while calculating the pull force.The Du Nouymethod uses a ring as a pull object.This technique usesthe contact between the platinum ring and the liquid surface.The ring is lowered below the interface by shifting the stage in which the liquid container is set up.After immersion, thestage gradually decreases as the ring raises the liquid ’s meniscus.This meniscus eventually separates from the ring.Before the tearing occurs, the volume of the meniscus (andthe corresponding force) reaches its highest value and thenstarts to decrease (https://www.biolinscienti ﬁc.com/).We investigated the e ﬀect of conjugate sample concentration (1% and 3%) on the surface tension of the solution.
Deter-mining of the concentration of the protein-polysaccharideconjugates tested was based on several types of literature.Protein: Whey protein/soy protein Dissolved in distilled water on a hotplate magnetic stirrer 350 rpm, 30 minutes Whey protein/soy protein solution Addition of polysaccharide (maltodextrin/pectin) Mass ratio of protein-polysaccharide : 1:2 (40 g : 80 g) 1:3 (30 g : 90 g) In 1000 g of distilled water Stirring 500 rpm, 18 hours at room temperature (27–30°C) Drying process using spray dryer Inlet temp: 150°C, outlet temp: 0.4 kPa compressed air pressure, 10 mL/minute of feed rate and 52 m3/h of airflow rate Spray dried powder Heated in an oven, at temperature of 90°C, 2 hours Protein-polysaccharide conjugates: WPMD 1:2, WPMD 1:3, WPP 1:2, WPP 1:3, SPMD 1:2, SPMD 1:3, SPP 1:2, SPP 1:3 Figure 1: Flowchart of preparation of protein-polysaccharide conjugates through Maillard reaction.3 International Journal of Food Science Emulsi ﬁers play an important role in determining the stabil- ity of an emulsion, including surface tension and interfacial tension [44].
Jusoh and Othman [45] mentioned that the higher concentration of surfactant/emulsi ﬁer causes emul- sion instability and concluded that 3% surfactant concentra- tion can form a stable emulsion. The dried powder of the protein-polysaccharide conju- gates was dissolved in distilled water to make a solution of protein-polysaccharide conjugates.The mixture was homog- enised with Ultraturrax (IKA T25) at 15,000 rpm for 1 minute.The measurement was made when no foam was on the solution ’s surface.The presence of foam will interfere with the accuracy of the surface tension measurement on the liquid surface.The tensiometer ring was placed below the surface of the liquid ( ±0.5 cm).Then, the ring was pulled upward through the surface of the liquid.The force needed for the ring to break the surface was expressed as the surface tension of the liquid (http://www.cscscienti ﬁc.com/surface- tension/CSC-duNouy-Tensiometers).Measurements were taken 3 times for each sample.2.3.2.
Emulsifying Activity Index (EAI). The EAI procedure was based on the method described by Pearce and Kinsella (1978), as cited by Mu et al.[46].Initially, the conjugate powder (0.2 g) was dissolved in 18 ml of a phosphate bu ﬀer (0.2 M, pH 7.4) that had been prepared in advance.In this test, we included a commercial emulsi ﬁer (Tween 80) as a control.Subsequently, oil-in-water emulsions were gener- ated by introducing 5 ml of soy oil into each solution of the sample conjugate.The emulsions were homogenised at 15,000 rpm for 3 minutes using Ultraturrax T25 homogeni- ser (IKA, Germany).Then, 100 μl of each emulsion was pipetted into 10 ml of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS).The absorbance was measured at 500 nm.The EAI measurements for each sample were repeated three times.
EAI was calculated using the following formula: EAI =2T×A× dilution factor c×Ф×L× 10000 m2/g, 1 where T=2303,Ais the absorbance, the dilution factor is 1000, cis the protein mass per volume unit (g/ml), Lis the optical path wide (0.01 m), and Фis the oil volumetric frac- tion (0.25). 2.3.3.Particle Size, Polydispersity, and Zeta Potential Measurement.The particle size and zeta potential were mea- sured to determine each conjugate sample ’s ability to emul- sify eugenol with water to form an emulsion.The particle size and zeta potential were measured using a particle size analyser (Zetasizer, Malvern).The emulsifying ability of the conjugates was tested by adding protein-polysaccharide conjugates to the eugenol emulsion.The conjugate solution was prepared by dissolving 0.75 g of the conjugate sample in 25 ml of distilled water.Then, it was homogenised at 15,000 rpm for 1 minute using an Ultraturrax homogeniser (IKA, Germany).
Eugenol (0.75 ml) was added to each sam- ple solution homogenised at 15,000 rpm for 1 minute to obtain an emulsion. Three drops of emulsion (0.07 g) werediluted in 20 ml of distilled water in a glass beaker.Two millilitres of solution was poured into the cuvette for mea- surement.For each sample, measurements were taken 3 times.2.3.4.Thermal Property Analysis.The thermal properties of conjugate samples were analysed using the di ﬀerential scan- ning calorimetry (DSC 8000 Perkin Elmer).The analysis was conducted on pure raw materials (whey protein, soy protein, maltodextrin, and pectin) and the resulting conjugate prod- ucts.Each sample was weighed to approximately 7-10 mg and then prepared in an aluminium pan.The sample was heated from 40 to 300°C at a heating rate of 10.00°C/minute.Thermal transitions were evaluated in terms of peak transi- tion temperature (Tp) and enthalpy (delta H).
On the basis of the International Confederation of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry Societies (ICTAC) standard, the peak value in the DSC thermogram is known as the melting point of the polymer sample (http://www.Perkinelmer.com). 2.3.5.Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR).FTIR analysis was carried out to determine the molecular characteristics of each conjugate sample.The results of FTIR informed the possibility of changes in the formation of protein and poly- saccharide conjugates.FTIR spectra of all samples were obtained using a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scienti ﬁc).The tool had a KBr beam splitter and a DTGS KBr detector.The spectra were recorded between 400 and 4000 cm-1with a resolution of 2 cm-1.In addition to the con- jugate samples, we included FTIR testing of whey protein, soy protein, maltodextrin, and pectin as controls.2.3.6.Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) Analysis.
SDS-PAGE is a method used to identify the formation of protein- polysaccharide conjugates. The research adopted and modi- ﬁed the procedures of Schmidt et al.[47] and Neirynck et al.[48] with modi ﬁcations.The preparation of the conjugate samples was carried out by dissolving each sample in dis- tilled water with a protein content of 4 mg/ml.Meanwhile, the whey protein and soy protein were dissolved with a pro- tein content of 2 mg/ml as controls.The solution was vor- texed for 1 minute until it formed a homogeneous solution.A 60 μl solution was added to the vial with 20 μl buﬀer solution (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.05% bromophenol blue).The sample was heated in boiling water for 5 minutes until denaturation occurred in the conjugate solution.A total of 20 μl for each sample solu- tion was added to the 60 μlb uﬀer solution and applied to the gel, as well as the whey protein and the soy protein solution.
A commercial molecular weight marker (Precision Plus std dual protein, Bio-Rad Laboratories) was also involved. Elec- trophoresis was carried out at 120 V by stacking (4% poly- acrylamide) and separation (12% polyacrylamide) using Mini Cell Protean electrophoresis units (Bio-Rad Laborato- ries, USA).The process took 120 minutes.Then, staining was carried out with 0.25% ( v/v) Coomassie brilliant blue in ethanol : acetic acid : water (45 : 10 : 45, v/v).The4 International Journal of Food Science destaining process used an acetic acid solution : ethanol : - water (5 : 10: 85, v/v).2.3.7.Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Observation.The surface morphology of the conjugate dried powders was observed with a scanning electron microscope (ZEISS, EVO MA 10).The specimen holder/stainless stub was coated with carbon tape.
The dry powder samples were placed and sprinkled as thin as possible on the surface of the carbon tape and then coated with gold by a sputter coat- ing (Quorum Q150R ES) at sputter current conditions of 20 mA and sputter time of 60 seconds. The coated samples were mounted on the stage holder for SEM observation.The surface images were taken at di ﬀerent magni ﬁcations (100 to 5000x) using the SE (secondary electron) detector at working distance (WD) 9.0 mm and 16.00 kV accelerating voltages.2.4.Statistical Analysis.All experiments except thermal property analysis, FTIR, and SDS-PAGE analysis were repeated three times.The results of the investigation were expressed as mean and standard deviation.Data were proc- essed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Tukey test to determine the signi ﬁcance between the average values, using MINITAB version 14.0.The level of signi ﬁ- cance was determined at p<005.The graphs were created using Origin 2018 software (Originlab.com).3.
Results and Discussion 3.1. Surface Tension 3.1.1.The E ﬀect of Soy and Whey Protein in Conjugate Products Containing Maltodextrin on Surface Tension.The presence of an interfacial layer around the emulsion gener- ally achieves the stability of a system.The properties of the interfacial layer are determined by the composition and structure of the adsorbed material, generally consisting of proteins and emulsi ﬁers [49].The interfacial tension between two liquids can be analogous to the surface tension or the tension at the interface of air and water.The hydro- phobic nature of air makes the air-water and surfactant combination valuable for understanding the behaviour of surfactants.The reduction in surface tension serves as the initial criterion for determining the emulsi ﬁcation capacity of a candidate emulsi ﬁer [50].A surface tension measure- ment was conducted to assess the e ﬃcacy of protein- polysaccharide conjugates as emulsi ﬁers in decreasing sur- face tension.
The result shows that soy protein-maltodextrin (SPMD) conjugates lower the surface tension more than whey protein-maltodextrin (WPMD) conjugates at the same con- centration (Figure 2). The surface tension of the soy protein conjugates di ﬀered signi ﬁcantly from that of the whey pro- tein.The order of the surface tension is SPMD 1 : 2 ≈SPMD 1:3<WPMD 1 : 2 ≈WPMD 1 : 3.This phenomenon is simi- lar to Kutzli et al.[51], who reported that the surface tension of the maltodextrin-SPI mixture was lower than the maltodextrin-whey protein isolate blend.Regarding Fang et al.[52], the whey protein isolate has lower surface activitythan plant proteins, such as soy protein, pea protein, and rice protein.The closely packed globular structure of the whey protein slows the di ﬀusion of proteins to the inter- face [53].
In contrast to more rigid whey proteins, soy protein has a mobile area structure that was believed to be responsible for a stronger unfolding at the interface and increased sur- face activity [54]. It can then be understood if the conjugates containing soy protein have a better ability to reduce surface tension than those containing whey protein.Another fact supporting this is that SPMD has higher protein levels than WPMD.The protein content of SPMD 1 : 2, SPMD 1 : 3, WPMD 1 : 2, and WPMD 1 : 3 was 11.89%, 10.98%, 4.08%, and 2.98%, respectively.According to Patino et al.[49], the properties of proteins and emulsi ﬁers at the water-air inter- face depend on how these surface-active components are adsorbed or dispersed and their solubility in water.
There- fore, it is likely that the presence of maltodextrin in the WPMD and SPMD conjugates does not determine the prop- erties of these conjugates in reducing surface tension, because maltodextrin does not have active surface sites [31, 55]. The role of protein-linked polysaccharide in maintain- ing the stability of the emulsion is through the mechanism of adsorbing its hydrophilic sites on the surface of the drop- let, thus increasing the thickness of the interfacial layer and with its steric repulsion force keeping the droplets separated [22].It is also hypothesised that proteins are principally responsible for the change in surface tension of maltodextrin-protein blends [51].3.1.2.The E ﬀect of Soy and Whey Protein in Conjugate Products Containing Pectin on Surface Tension.The conju- gate products of pectin with soy or whey protein had a dif- ferent surface tension phenomenon.
The whey protein- pectin (WPP) conjugate was able to reduce surface tension more than the soy protein-pectin (SPP) conjugate. In con- trast to maltodextrin-containing conjugates, the decrease in surface tension by pectin-containing conjugates did not appear to be in ﬂuenced by protein.The protein contents of WPP 1 : 2, WPP 1 : 3, SPP 1 : 2, and SPP 1 : 3 were 5.18%, 4.31%, 11.49%, and 11.43%, respectively.Unlike maltodex- trin, pectin shows a high negative charge density [56].Sur- face properties come from a large number of acetyl groups and proteins [57], as well as amphiphilic parts and hydro- phobic groups in pectin [58].When proteins and hydrocol- loids have a negative net charge, the positive charge in the protein will interact with the negative charge possessed by the polysaccharide to form a soluble complex [59].These soluble formations can be adsorbed on the interface surface and function as an emulsi ﬁer.As stated by Patino et al.
[49], the water solubility a ﬀects the properties of the emulsi- ﬁer. Furthermore, it is believed that the disparity in molecu- lar weight between WPP and SPP conjugates impacts the surface tension of both conjugates.Since soy protein is a high molecular weight emulsi ﬁer [60], the SPP conjugate is likely to have a higher molecular weight than the WPP con- jugate.Moreover, Deng [60] asserted that emulsi ﬁers char- acterised by low molecular weight have the potential to further decrease surface tension.5 International Journal of Food Science Consequently, it is reasonable to expect that WPP exhibits a lower surface tension compared to SPP.The dif-ference in molecular weight in the types of polysaccharidesand proteins a ﬀects the molecular weight of the conjugate produced, which then also a ﬀects the adsorption ’s rapidity.According to Zinoviadou et al.
[61], the slow adsorption tothe interface can be caused by the large size of the molecule.The ANOVA showed that the increase in the pectin ratio did not signi ﬁcantly a ﬀect the surface tension of the con- jugate products. Conjugates with a protein-polysaccharideratio 1 : 3 tended to have a higher surface tension thanthe 1 : 2 ratio.This phenomenon may be related to theunconjugated pectin dispersed in the water.Pectin hassurface activity; therefore, in a homogeneous state inwater, the surface area of pectin increases and can reducesurface tension.The decrease in surface tension is consis-tent with the increase in pectin concentration until anaggregation state forms, where surface tension cannot lon-ger be reduced [62].3.1.3.The E ﬀect of Concentration of Conjugate Products on Surface Tension.The results of the surface tension measure- ments (Figure 2) also provided information on the e ﬀect of the conjugate concentration on the surface tension of the conjugate samples.
According to Perinelli et al. [63], as the concentration of emulsi ﬁer/surfactant increases, the surface tension will decrease.The adsorption of surfactant at theinterface leads to a reduction in the repulsion of the interfacedue to the surfactant ’s attraction for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases.Consequently, a reduction in interfacialtension causes a change in interface, which is furtherinduced by mechanical forces, resulting in the formation ofan emulsion [64].The higher the surfactant concentration,the more intense the reaction becomes, hence the increasein the decrease of surface tension.The increase in conjugateconcentration in the emulsi ﬁcation process exhibited a gen- eral trend of reducing water surface tension, except for WPP 1 : 2, SPMD 1 : 3, and SPP 1 : 2 samples.However, the resultsof the ANOVA test indicate that all three samples with aconcentration of 3.0% were not signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent from the same sample at a concentration of 1.0%.
The increasein surface tension in both conjugate samples was likely dueto the saturation of the oil/water interface emulsi ﬁer or the attainment of limitable surface tension (limiting surface ten-sion), as expressed by Burlatsky et al. [65].In bulk concen-tration, surfactants aggregate to form micelles, calledcritical micellisation concentration (CMC).At this condi- tion, the surfactant cannot anymore reduce surface tension [62].
The protein-polysaccharide conjugates produced fromthis study have the potential to be further developed andstudied as natural emulsi ﬁers because they have the potential to reduce the surface tension of water, especially WPP 1 : 2.The surface tension value of WPP 1 : 2 (43.77 dyne/cm 2)i s close to the surface tension of the commercial emulsi ﬁers Tween 60 and Tween 80 which is around 40 dyne/cm2at a concentration of 1% [66].0102030405060 WPMD 1:2 WPMD 1:3 WPP 1:2 WPP 1:3 SPMD 1:2 SamplesSPMD 1:3 SPP 1:2 SPP 1:3Concentration (%)58.1756.87 47.0749 43.77 43.8748.77 47.5349.8147.33 49.9352.6 51.1855.4 53 51.27 Concentration 1% Concentration 3% Figure 2: Surface tension of protein-polysaccharide conjugate solution with concentrations of 1.0% and 3.0% (surface tension values are the mean of three replicate samples; di ﬀerent letters indicate signi ﬁcance in the mean surface tension value at the 95% level).6 International Journal of Food Science 3.2. Emulsifying Index Activity.
Emulsifying index activity (EAI) is an important parameter that determines the quality of an emulsi ﬁer. The test result showed that the conjugates formed containing pectin (WPP and SPP) had a more nota- ble EAI than those using maltodextrin (WPMD and SPMD).The EAI values of WPP 1 : 2, WPP 1 : 3, SPP 1 : 2, and SPP 1 : 3 were 27.18, 24.92, 18.45, and 25.27 m2/g, respectively.The WPMD 1 : 2, WPMD 1 : 3, SPMD 1 : 2, and SPMD 1 : 3 have EAI values of 8.95, 7.44, 6.76, and 5.19 m2/g, respec- tively.The results of the variance analysis and Tukey ’s addi- tional test showed that the EAI value of the WPP conjugate sample was signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent from WPMD ( p<005), as well as between SPP and SPMD (Figure 3).In the oil-in- water emulsion system, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of protein molecules are adsorbed at the interface of oil and water to form an amphipathic ﬁlm.At the same time, the presence of polysaccharides has the role of thickening theﬁlm layer around the oil droplet.
This condition prevents theﬂocculation and coalescence of protein molecules, increasing the stability of protein-emulsifying properties [67]. Maltodextrin and pectin have di ﬀerent structures that aﬀect the character of adsorption.Maltodextrins have no surface activity, thus allowing them to stabilise the emulsion by gel formation or modi ﬁcation of the viscosity of the aque- ous phase.On the other hand, pectin is a polysaccharide that has interfacial activity.Pectin contains protein residues and acetyl groups (4-5%), which help improve its emulsifying ability due to its hydrophobic nature [68].Hydrophobic sites or chains adsorb on the surface of the oil-water interface.This action prevents ﬂocculation and coalescence through electrostatic power and steric repulsion [14].This assertionis consistent with the research conducted by Shu et al.[69], which concluded a positive correlation between the length of polysaccharide chain and the emulsi ﬁcation activ- ity of the conjugates.
Furthermore, Hernández-García et al. [70] revealed that the higher molecular weight could a ﬀect the increase in emulsifying ability.Polysaccharides posses- sing greater molecular weights tend to be more advanta- geous for conjugation because of their increased steric hindrance.The property confers advantages in reducing coalescence and enhancing the emulsifying properties of conjugates [71, 72].As mentioned above, the molecular weight of pectin tends to be higher than that of maltodextrin, and, under- standably, protein conjugation with pectin resulted in a higher emulsifying activity index than in conjugation with maltodextrin.Figure 3 also shows the e ﬀect of di ﬀerent types of protein on the same kind of polysaccharide.Conjugate samples con- taining whey protein (WPMD and WPP) appear to have higher EAI values than conjugate samples containing soy protein (SPMD and SPP).
However, the EAI value of WPMD was not signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent from SPMD, nor was the EAI value of WPP signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent from SPP except for SPP 1 : 2 (Figure 3). Based on the overall measurement results, it was found that the WPP 1 : 2 had the highest EAI value and was close to the EAI value of Tween 80 as a commercial emul- siﬁer (graph not shown).This result is in agreement with sur- face tension measurements, where the WPP 1 : 2 conjugate sample performs best in reducing surface tension.According to Li et al.
[73], emulsi ﬁcation activity is in ﬂuenced by the ability of proteins to reduce interfacial tension.WPMD 1:2 WPMD 1:3 WPP 1:2 WPP 1:3 SPMD 1:2 SamplesSPMD 1:3 SPP 1:2 SPP 1:3051015Emulsifying activity index (m2/g) 20253035 8.55 7.44 5.196.7618.4525.2724.9227.18 Figure 3: Emulsifying activity index of conjugates (EAI values are the mean of 3 replicate samples and three measurements; di ﬀerent letters indicate signi ﬁcance in the mean EAI value at the 95% level).7 International Journal of Food Science 3.3. Droplet Size, Polydispersity Index, and Zeta Potential 3.3.1.Droplet Size.The results showed that the WPMD emulsion samples had smaller droplets than other conjugate emulsions (Table 1), while the SPP emulsion had higher droplets.The droplet size distribution graph can be seen in Figure 4.All emulsions show a multimodal distribution, but each has distinct peaks.
The eugenol emulsion with WPP conjugates appeared to have a larger particle size with higher intensity compared to that of the emulsion using WPMD conjugates. Figure 4 also shows that conjugates with a higher polysaccharide ratio a ﬀect the size of the droplets and the intensity of the particle/droplet size.Emulsions of WPMD 1 : 3 had a higher droplet size and intensity than emulsions of WPMD 1 : 2.The emulsions of WPP 1 : 3 and WPP 1 : 2 showed a similar phenomenon.Protein types a ﬀect particle size, especially in particle size distribution.The SPMD 1 : 2 emulsion had a smaller droplet size (230 nm) than the emulsion with WPMD 1 : 2 (256 nm).The droplet size of the SPMD 1 : 3 emulsion seemed to be larger than that of the WPMD 1 : 3 emulsion at greater maltodextrin concentrations.However, statistical analysis indicated that this di ﬀerence was not statistically signi ﬁcant.
It should be noted that SPMD emulsions have more multi- modal particle size distribution peaks than WPMD (Figure 4). The multimodal particle size distribution pro ﬁle indicates the inhomogeneity of the emulsion.The di ﬀerence in polysaccharide ratio in conjugates containing soy protein also tended to increase the droplet size.The droplet size of the SPMD 1 : 3 emulsion was higher than the SPMD 1 : 2 emulsion, as well as between the SPP 1 : 3 and SPP 1 : 2 emul- sions, as indicated in Table 1.Figure 4 shows the droplet size graph of SPMD and SPP emulsions, highlighting the dis- cernible disparity in the droplet size distribution between the two.When the multimodal distribution graph of both SPMD and SPP emulsions is examined, it becomes evident that the SPMD emulsion exhibits more peaks than the SPP emulsion.The molecular weight of the conjugate product a ﬀects the droplet size of the resulting emulsion.
Low molecular weight surfactants are more e ﬀective in producing emulsions with small droplet [14]. Nagaraju et al.[55] revealed that low molecular weight causes sodium caseinate to have rapid adsorbing properties at the interface and contributes to the formation of small particle.Considering that themolecular weight of pectin is greater than that of the maltodextrin [55, 74], it is reasonable to infer that the droplet size of WMPD emulsion is comparatively smaller than that of WPP.Similarly, the droplet size of the SPMD emulsion is smaller than that of the SPP emulsion.How- ever, the adsorption properties of the polysaccharide con- jugated with the protein also a ﬀect the particle size of an emulsion.Protein molecules or polysaccharides that are not entirely conjugated can also cause the large droplet size of the resulting emulsion.Free protein molecules may still have the function of emulsifying oil because they have surface-active or hydrophobic parts.
However, even excess amounts can cause droplet accumulation [75]. Unabsorbed polysaccharides can lead to ﬂocculation [76], resulting in large droplet, a wide particle size distribution, and instability of the emulsion.3.3.2.Polydispersity Index.The polydispersity index (PdI) is a value that indicates particle size heterogeneity.PdI values are expressed between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates a monodis- perse particle dispersion system, while 1 indicates a highly polydisperse system [77].The conjugate emulsions observed in this study had PdI values between 0.3 and 0.64, indicating an emulsion system that tends to be polydisperse.The anal- ysis of emulsion droplet size measurements revealed that the whey protein conjugate emulsions (WPMD and WPP) exhibited smaller polydispersity index (PdI) values com- pared to those of the soy protein conjugate emulsions (SPMD and SPP).The probable reason for this phenomenon is that soy protein has a greater molecular weight than whey protein.
Based on the result of Nagaraju et al. [55], PdI values can be in ﬂuenced by the molecular weight of the car- rier material in the formation of the particle multilayer sys- tem.However, the di ﬀerence in PdI values was not signiﬁcantly di ﬀerent, except between WPP 1 : 2 and SPMD 1 : 3.The WPP 1 : 2 emulsion has the smallest PdI value (0.37), while SPMD 1 : 3 has the most signi ﬁcant PdI value (0.64).Figure 4 displays the graphical representation of the distribution of droplet sizes.The SPMD 1 : 3 emulsion has a larger droplet size distri- bution with many peaks than the WPP 1 : 2 emulsion.The unimodal droplet size distribution pattern and low PdI value indicate high adsorbing or emulsifying properties at the interface [55].Although the WPP 1 : 2 conjugate emulsion had a larger particle size of 651 nm compared to the WPMDTable 1: Droplet size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential of conjugates.

The independent role of pectinis believed to help form an emulsion system that is relativelymore homogeneous than that of emulsions with other typesof conjugates. The conjugate product obtained through theMaillard reaction is a complex mixture that includes conju-gated compounds and unconjugated proteins and polysac- charides [72].The addition of pectin concentration to the whey protein-pectin conjugate (WPP 1 : 3) increased the PdI value.Djuardi et al.[78] have reported that variations in the con- centration of protein-conjugated components can in ﬂuence adsorption activity, leading to coalescence and the emer-gence of a diverse range of particle sizes.Another possiblecause of multimodal distribution or high polydispersity isthe aggregation of droplets due to reassociation and rear-rangement of emulsifying materials or other materialsinvolved in the emulsion [79].
The PdI values observed inthe study showed a positive correlation with the emulsifyingactivity, as indicated by the emulsifying activity index (EAI).Theﬁndings indicated that the WPP 1 : 2 conjugate signi ﬁ- cantly exhibited the highest emulsifying activity, while SPMD 1 : 3 demonstrated the lowest value of the emulsifyingactivity index (EAI) (Figure 3).0246810121416Intensity (percent) 0246810121416Intensity (percent)0246810121418 16Intensity (percent) 0246810121418 16Intensity (percent)0.1 1 10 Size distribution (d.nm)100 1000 10000 0.1 1 10 Size distribution (d.nm)100 1000 10000 WPMD 1:2 WPMD 1:3WPP 1:2 WPP 1:3SPMD 1:2 SPMD 1:3SPP 1:2 SPP 1:3 0.1 1 10 Size distribution (d.nm)100 1000 10000 0.1 1 10 Size distribution (d.nm)100 1000 10000 WPMD 1:2 WPMD 1:3SPMD 1:2 SPMD 1:3WPP 1:2 WPP 1:3SPP 1:2 SPP 1:3 Figure 4: Size distribution by intensity of eugenol emulsion using various protein-polysaccharide conjugates resulting from DLS measurement.
Comparison between conjugates with the same protein type (WPMD-WPP, SPMD-SPP) and conjugates with the same polysaccharide type (WPMD-SPMD, WPP-SPP).9 International Journal of Food Science 3.3.3. Zeta Potential.The electric charge interface in ﬂuences the emulsion stability.The ζ-potential serves as an indica- tor of the level of interaction between emulsion droplets.The magnitude of the ζ-potential directly correlates with the strength of the repulsive force between the droplets, therefore in ﬂuencing the stability of the system [80].An elevated zeta potential corresponds to a strong electrostatic repulsion among particles, resulting in increased resistance to aggregation and a stronger tendency to remain distinct [14, 81, 82].On the contrary, if the zeta potential exhibits a low value, the particles approach one another, aggregate, orﬂocculate, leading to an increase in the observed parti- cle size [14].
The zeta potential values of all emulsion samples, as pre- sented in Table 1, exhibit a negative value. Most emulsion samples have zeta potential values close to -30 mV, indicat- ing the stability of the emulsion.WPP conjugates had higher zeta potential values (-37 mV and -34 mV) than WPMD (-24 mV and -26 mV).The zeta potential values of the WPP conjugates were comparatively higher (-37 mV and -34 mV) compared to WPMD (-24 mV and -26 mV).Although the droplet size of the WPMD emulsion was lower than that of WPP, the zeta potential measurements indicate that WPP exhibits more stability than WPMD.Emulsions are considered to exhibit stability when their zeta potential value is less than -30 mV or more than +30 mV [83].The diﬀerence in zeta potential between WPP and WPMD was probably due to di ﬀerences in the adsorption properties and surface activity of the two polysaccharides.
The concen- tration of WPMD conjugate used in emulsi ﬁcation is likely insuﬃcient to adsorb the oil entirely and reduce surface ten- sion. This possibility is also evident from the fact that the surface tension of WPMD is higher than WPP ’s (Figure 2).Zhang et al.[75] reported that insu ﬃciency of emulsi ﬁers leads to lack of repulsion and increased coalescences, result- ing in an unstable emulsion system.WPP conjugates may contain unconjugated pectin [72], enabling direct interac- tion with oil.Pectin is a polysaccharide that has surface activity and a nonpolar region.As a result, it functions to stabilise emulsions through the adsorption process on the surface of oil particles [84].The zeta potential value of the soy protein-maltodextrin conjugate emulsion (SPMD) tends to be higher than the soy protein-pectin conjugate emulsion (SPP), but the di ﬀerence was insigni ﬁcant.
This phenomenon is likely due to di ﬀer- ences in the properties of maltodextrin and pectin, their interaction with soy protein, and their association with unconjugated proteins and polysaccharides. Soy protein has some surface-active globular proteins, as does pectin, although in smaller amounts.Both unconjugated soy protein and pectin are believed to in ﬂuence the decrease in the zeta potential.According to Schröder et al.[85], the reduction in zeta potential due to the addition of protein is a result of the formation of dense multilayers that increase surface cover- age.The multilayer formation can be derived from unconju- gated soy protein or pectin containing protein.
In addition, unconjugated pectin can also play a role in reducing zeta potential because it is related to the presence of carboxylic acid groups [84].Increasing the concentration of polysaccharides in protein-polysaccharide conjugates decreases the zeta poten- tial value in conjugates containing whey protein and increases the zeta potential value in conjugates containing soy protein; however, the change was not signi ﬁcant (p<005). The di ﬀerence in zeta potential trend depends on the type of protein.This phenomenon may be due to the kind of protein and polysaccharide and the presence of unconjugated proteins and polysaccharide molecules.The whey protein used in the study has a low protein content of 11%, allowing unconjugated maltodextrin and pectin to occur in the conjugation process.
The existence of biopoly- mers on the surface of oil droplets could lead to the forma- tion of a viscoelastic layer, which hinders the coalescence process and consequently improves the stability of the emul- sions [86]. However, an excessive concentration leads to an electrostatic screening phenomenon, decreasing the charge of the droplet and the zeta potential [87].The soy protein has a high protein content of 81.06%.Increasing the concen- tration of maltodextrin or pectin in the conjugation process with soy protein might increase the production of conju- gates.In addition, there may also be unconjugated protein or free protein.This was con ﬁrmed by SEM observations of spherical and smooth-surfaced particles that were not found in the whey protein-containing conjugate samples.The free protein can be adsorbed on oil droplets because it has a surface-active or hydrophobic side.
The quantity of protein a ﬀects the formation of a viscoelastic ﬁlm around the oil droplet and the stability of the emulsion [88, 89]. 3.4.Di ﬀerential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) of Conjugates.Emulsions, especially those stabilised with proteins, are very sensitive to heat [90].Thermal stability is one of the proper- ties that must be possessed by food emulsi ﬁers, because food processing generally uses heat processes.DSC is a sensitive tool for assessing the thermal stability and conformation of proteins [91, 92].Protein-containing emulsi ﬁers are prone to denaturation during heat processing.The denaturation of globular proteins is related to the destruction of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that strengthen and stabilise the conformation of the native protein [56].The process is followed by interactions between proteins and aggregation between protein molecules that coat the oil in an emulsion system [93].
Aggregation can be physically limited by the presence of conjugated proteins at the oil/ water interface with a function of steric stabilisation [93]. In addition, the presence of polysaccharides as part of the protein-polysaccharide conjugate can reduce the sol- vent availability of proteins through the crowding e ﬀect and act as steric spacers between protein molecules, protect- ing globular proteins from aggregation and remaining in a steady-state structure [56, 94].This mechanism is thought to occur in WPMD conjugates, giving WPMD certain ther- mal properties.WPMD conjugates had the peak temperature at 71.60°C, which is probably a molecular structural change and at 204.55°C (Figure 5), which is related to the decomposition [55].The decomposition temperature of both WPMD 1 : 2 and WPMD 1 : 3 was higher than that of whey protein10 International Journal of Food Science (150°C) and maltodextrin, presumably related to its conju- gated form with maltodextrin.
The Maillard reaction canreduce the sensitivity of proteins to heat treatment by inhi-biting intermolecular interactions between protein mole-cules and maintaining the native structure of the protein[94]. The results of this study are in line with the previousresearch reporting that the thermal stability of whey protein isolates increased through glucose conjugation [95].The increase in thermal stability is also indicated by an increasein the value of ΔH.The ΔHvalue of WPMD conjugate is higher than that of the whey protein.According to Ibanoglu[56], an increase in enthalpy change may occur due to adecrease in protein aggregation due to denaturation.Soy protein-maltodextrin (SPMD) had a higher peak temperature and ΔHvalue than soy protein, indicating higher thermal stability.Compared to WPMD, the conjugateSPMD also showed higher values ΔH.This is related to the diﬀerence in protein composition between the two types of protein.
The peak temperature of the soy protein (82.50 °C) was lower than the whey protein; however, the soy proteinhad a higher ΔHvalue. The di ﬀerence in heat stabilitybetween soy protein and whey protein is related to the dena- turation behaviour and structural complexity of soy protein[96].Lower ΔHvalue indicates that less energy is required for denaturation [56].Thus, SPMD can be said to have bet-ter thermal stability than WPMD because it requires moreenergy for denaturation.In conjugate samples containingsoy protein, the ratio of maltodextrin to pectin mass did not aﬀect the endothermic peak temperature.Meanwhile, increasing the mass ratio of maltodextrin in conjugationwith whey protein slightly increased the endothermic peaktemperature but not with an increase in the pectin ratio.Conjugates containing maltodextrin (WPMD and SPMD)tend to have higher ΔHvalues than their native proteins.
In addition to that, conjugates containing pectin tend tohave a higher enthalpy change value than those withmaltodextrin. Diﬀerent types of polysaccharides provide other thermal characteristics.This fact can be seen from the enthalpy value generated from the scanning calorimetry results in the WPMD and WPP samples and between SPMD and SPP.

Unlike maltodextrin, pectin has a negative charge.
When proteins and hydrocolloids arenegatively charged, the attraction of the positive charge inthe protein and the negative charge in the polysaccharidewill result in a soluble protein-polysaccharide complex [59].The increased negative charge also strengthens theelectrostatic repulsion between proteins, preventing proteinaggregation [97]. This is likely the reason for the highervalues of ΔHWPP and SPP compared to WPMD and SPMD.The conjugate sample containing pectin showed anenthalpy value lower than that of the native protein.Ibanoglu [56] stated that the lower ΔHvalue of conjugates indicates less energy for denaturation; it is likely related to partial denaturation before heat treatment due to the highcharge density of biopolymers.3.5.Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) of Conjugates.Fou- rier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis was performed inorder to characterise the bonds present in the samples.Eachfunctional group possesses a speci ﬁc absorption region.
This approach enables the identi ﬁcation of alterations or the development of new chemical bonds. The bonds that formamide groups (C-O, N-H, and C-N) associated with theMaillard reaction products are absorbed at wavelengths of 800-1800 cm -1[98].The IR spectra of the conjugate samples are depicted in Figure 6, while the IR spectra of whey pro-tein, soy protein, maltodextrin, and pectin are contained inthe supplemental data.The featured bands at 1644 cm -1in the conjugate samples containing whey protein (WPMDand WPP) are called C-O stretching of amide I.The absorp-tion area of amide is divided into two parts: amide I between1600 and 1700 cm -1and amide II at wavelengths around 1550 cm-1[99].Compared with native whey protein spectra, the amide I group in the conjugate sample experienced ashift in wavelength and decreased absorption intensity.
The whey protein had an amide I group at 1634 cm -1with an absorption intensity of 25% and then shifted to 1644 cm-1 in conjugate WPMD with an absorption intensity of about15%. The band at 1645 cm -1was related to the Schi ﬀbase ’sC=N stretching vibration, which resulted from the Maillard reaction [100].The whey protein spectra also showed the presence of an amide II group at 1538 cm-1.However, this band was not detected in the conjugate sample.According to Liu et al.[95], changes and decreases in intensity in the conjugateproduct occur due to vibrations in the amide I and amideII groups due to the deformation of the N-H bond and thestretching of the C-N bond.In addition, OH groups frommaltodextrin and amino groups from whey protein are con-sumed during heating in the Maillard process.This eventalso explained why amide II (N-H) groups were not detectedin the conjugate product.These results were also supported by the results of Su et al.
[101], who found a gradual decrease in intensity at a wavelength of 1600-1400 cm -1during the Maillard reaction between carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)and soy protein isolates. Previous studies have explained thatfunctional groups, including NH 2, especially lysine, may be lost [102].The decrease in the intensity of amide I and amide II is usually followed by the formation or increase of amide IIIgroups arising mainly from the stretching of C-N (pyrazineand Schi ﬀbase), which is the result of the Maillard reaction [103] and the deformation of the N-H, in the wavelengthrange of 1240-1450 cm -1.The original whey proteins had bands at 1260, 1358, and 1422 cm-1, representing the amide III group (Figure 6).The conjugation process caused a bandshift, and the conjugate samples had bands between 1367and 1368 cm -1.The transmittance percentage of WPMD 1 : 3 was relatively smaller than that of WPMD 1 : 2, whileWPP 1 : 3 and WPP 1 : 2 had a similar transmittance per-centage.
In conjugation with whey protein, an increase inmaltodextrin mass tended to increase absorption intensity,indicating an increase in C=O bond absorption (amide I). The opposite phenomenon occurred in the conjugation of maltodextrin with soy protein.The increase in maltodex- trin mass in the ratio between polysaccharide and protein caused a change in the wavelength of amide group I, whichwas initially 1634 cm -1in the soy protein to 1651 cm-1in the soy maltodextrin (SPMD) protein conjugate 1 : 3.TheTable 2: Peak temperature and enthalpy change values of whey protein, soy protein, maltodextrin, pectin, and conjugate products.

Increasing the mass of pectin in con-junction with whey protein and soy protein does not a ﬀect the absorption intensity.The analysis showed that the conju-gates WPP 1 : 2 and WPP 1 : 3 have coincident spectra andSPP 1 : 2 and SPP 1 : 3.3.6.SDS-PAGE.
SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out to con- ﬁrm the covalent bonds between proteins and polysaccha- rides. In the lane of SPMD 1 : 3, the protein bands wereseen at molecular weights of 25 kDa and then appeared tofade to more than 180 kDa.The waning intensity of proteinbands in the conjugate sample indicates the occurrence ofconjugation between protein and polysaccharides duringthe Maillard reaction [104 –106].SPMD 1 : 2 seemed to show a deeper intensity of colour than the SPMD 1 : 3 conjugates(Figure 7).Furthermore, the SPMD 1 : 2 line showed scat- tered bands in the range of 70 kDa to a molecular weight of 180 kDa, indicating the conjugation of soy protein andmaltodextrin.This statement is based on the results of a sim-ilar study [107].The decrease in blue colour intensity indi-cates the conjugation between soy protein and dextran through the Maillard reaction [108].
Another ﬁnding stated that the bands fade out, suggesting that not all proteinsinteract with polysaccharides and form conjugates [19]. There was almost no di ﬀerence in the SDS-PAGE pat- tern between SPP 1 : 2 and SPP 1 : 3.The intensity of thebands identi ﬁed in the soy protein appears to fade.Faintly visible bands of typical proteins at molecular weights of 15 kDa and 25 kDa then diminished and formed polydis-persed bands until the top of the separating gel, indicatingthe formation of the higher molecular weight of the product[109].According to Ma et al.[110], the disappearance ofprotein bands in the conjugate product may be related tothe large number of grafted peptides in the conjugate.BothWPMD conjugates, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3, also showed similar SDS-PAGE patterns.The native whey protein bands were clearly seen in molecular weights of 15 kDa and 25 kDa.
This pattern is not much di ﬀerent from the whey protein isolates that have patterns at 14 kDa ( α-lactalbumin), 18 kDa ( β-lactoglobu- lin), 37 kDa ( β-lactoglobulin dimer), and 67 kDa (bovine020406080100 10131015136713671634 16442926 2924 101313671644 2925 3297 101310151367136213641651 1013Transmittance (%) 020406080100Transmittance (%) 020406080100Transmittance (%) 020406080100Transmittance (%)Wavenumber (cm–1)1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 WPMD 1:2 WPMD 1:3Wavenumber (cm–1)1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 WPP 1:2 WPP 1:3 Wavenumber (cm–1)1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 SPMD 1:2 SPMD 1:3Wavenumber (cm–1)1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 SPP 1:2 SPP 1:33295 3297 13671634 2927 32973297328729242925 Figure 6: Infrared spectra of conjugate samples.13 International Journal of Food Science serum albumin) [47]. The polydispersion of bands occurred and faded at molecular weights of more than 180 kDa.
Nostaining was seen in WPP 1 : 3 (lane 8), while WPP 1 : 2 (lane 9) showed a broadband with a low stain intensity between 10 and 35 kDa molecular weight. Each conjugate type has dif-ferent intensity bands, possibly due to transformation ofthe protein molecule that occurs later in the reaction [111].There are several possible causes for this phenomenon.It was probably related to the low protein content of whey pro-tein and the nature of the pectin that forms the gel, thusinhibiting protein separation in electrophoresis.Comparedto WPP, the SPP conjugate lane showed more noticeablestaining results.The band in lane SPP appeared diminishedand di ﬀused along the gel.This ﬁnding is the same as the results of Ma et al.[112]; bands of the soy protein isolate- pectin conjugate faded out in the range of molecular weights of 15 kDa, 25-35 kDa, and 55-70 kDa.
Extensive and spread-out bands suggest the conjugation of protein with polysac-charides and the formation of molecules of high molecularweight [39]. 3.7.Physical Appearance and Surface Morphology of Conjugate Spray-Dried Powder 3.7.1.Physical Appearance.The di ﬀerence in product colour observed in conjugate products containing whey protein and soy protein can be attributed to the di ﬀerent interactions between soy and whey protein with maltodextrin or pectinduring the Maillard process (Figure 8).The Maillard reac-tion occurs through a series of three distinct stages.Duringthe initial phase, a covalent linkage is established betweenthe carbonyl group present on the reducing sugar of thepolysaccharide and the amino group found on the aminoacid, peptide, or protein.This interaction forms a Schi ﬀbase, producing an N-substituted glycosylamine compound.Sub-sequently, the glycosylamine undergoes rearrangement, cre-ating a more stable Amadori product [108].
At this stage, no alterations were observed in the resultant product ’s colour, ﬂavour, metal chelation, and toxicity. The soy protein-maltodextrin (SPMD) conjugate had the palest colour among the other conjugate samples.This maybe related to the time it takes for the Maillard reaction to occur.Boonlao et al.[105] found that the formation of Ama-dori products in the conjugation of soy protein isolate and maltodextrin occurred between day one and day three at 60 °C, based on the measurement of the progress of the Mail- lard reaction.The conjugation reaction of soy protein-maltodextrin in this study took place at 90 °C for 2 hours.Therefore, it is conceivable that the SPMD conjugate prod-uct derived from the Maillard reaction during the early orin the development stage of the Amadori product, resultingin the absence of any observable alteration in colour.Changes in the product ’s colour to become darker occur at the intermediate and ﬁnal stages of the Maillard reaction [113, 114].
In addition to the Maillard reaction time, brow-ning appears to be a ﬀected by the type of protein. Conju- gates containing whey protein seemed browner than conjugates containing soy protein.This may be related tothe kind of whey protein.The bovine milk whey proteinused in the study has a high carbohydrate content(75.77%).Given the explanation that the more carbonylgroups will a ﬀect the browning reaction [115], it can be understood why the colours of WPMD and WPP are darkerthan those of SPMD and SPP.Figure 8 shows that the di ﬀerences in protein a ﬀect the colour of the resulting conjugate products.The colour di ﬀer- ence may be related to the colour of the whey protein used inthe conjugation process.Whey protein powder used in this research had a darker colour than soy protein powder.The colour of the resulting conjugate product may also indicatethe occurrence of a Maillard reaction and the success ofthe conjugation process.
Monitoring the progress of theMaillard reaction can be achieved by assessing many factors,including the advancement of colouration, changes in pHlevels, and the production of insoluble reaction products[116]. The whey protein-maltodextrin (WPMD) conjugatepowder appears browner in colour than the whey protein-pectin (WPP) conjugate powder.This is likely due to themolecular weight di ﬀerence between maltodextrin and pec- tin.
Several studies have shown that the variations in the molecular weight of polysaccharides during conjugationwith proteins in ﬂuence the degree of browning observed in 180 kDa 130 kDa 100 kDa 70 kDa 55 kDa 40 kDa 35 kDa 25 kDa 15 kDa M 12 3 4 5 67 89 10 Figure 7: SDS-PAGE pattern of conjugate samples (M: marker; 1: SPMD 1 : 3; 2: SPMD 1 : 2; 3: SPP 1 : 3; 4: SPP 1 : 2; 5: native soy protein; 6: WPMD 1 : 3; 7: WPMD 1 : 2; 8: WPP 1 : 3; 9: WPP 1 : 2; 10: native whey protein; WPMD: whey protein-maltodextrin; WPP: whey protein-pectin; SPMD: soy protein-maltodextrin; SPP: soy protein-pectin).14 International Journal of Food Science the resulting conjugate products. Klinchongkon et al.[117] showed that the WPI-pectin conjugate sample with the low-est molecular weight has the highest increase in brown col-our intensity.The lower the molecular weight of pectin,the higher the number of reducing end groups [118].According to Spotti et al.
[115], the number of carbonylgroups on polysaccharides can accelerate the occurrence ofthe Maillard reaction, which can increase the intensity ofthe brown colour. In addition, it is also known that polysac-charides rich in reducing sugars are more susceptible to browning during the Maillard reaction.Protein conjugation with long-chain polysaccharides exerts a suppressive e ﬀect on the appearance of enzyme browning [119].The fact thatmaltodextrin has a molecular weight (17-20 kDa) [74],which is less than pectin (60-130 kDa) [55], may explainthe above phenomenon.This mechanism also applies tothe colour di ﬀerence between SPMD and SPP.The in ﬂuence of protein and carbohydrate structure on the time of the Maillard reaction seems probable.Underidentical times and conditions of the Maillard reaction, theresultant conjugate products may arise from distinct stagesof the Maillard reaction (early, intermediate, or ﬁnal stage), depending upon the speci ﬁc protein and polysaccharide involved.
3.7.2. Surface Morphology.The surface morphologies of the spray-dried powder samples were observed with scanningelectron microscopy (SEM).A total of 8 conjugate sampleswere observed.Images were sought that depicted sampleparticles of various sizes to show the range of particle sizes.In addition, particles with di ﬀerent morphologies show any changes in the particles during the drying process of the con- jugate samples.Captured images were taken six times at magni ﬁcations of 100, 200, 500, 1000, 3000, and 5000 times.This article only shows the image at a magni ﬁcation of 5000 times (Figure 9).Conjugate samples that contain maltodextrins, such as WPMD and SPMD, tended to have irregular shapes withcurved and shrunken surfaces (Figure 9).The curves on thesurface were formed from the shrinkage of the microcapsuleduring the drying process, followed by a cooling process.
Asreported earlier, the rapid loss of water and shrinkage of theparticle surfaces during spray drying cause concave deforma-tion and uneven surfaces of the powder samples [120]. Thepresence of sugars a ﬀects the surface irregularity of microcap- sules [121].This statement explains why the particles observed in the WPMD samples have more indentations and shrunken surfaces than those observed in the SPMDsamples.WPMD contain sugar derived from maltodextrinand whey protein.Based on the approximate results of theanalysis, the whey protein used in the study has a protein con-tent of 7.85% and a carbohydrate content of 75.77%, while soyprotein has a protein content of 81.06% and a carbohydratecontent of 5.42% (data not shown).SPMD conjugates alsohave spherical particles with a smooth surface without inden-tation.This observation aligns with the research conductedby Shao et al.
[120]; it is observed that the incorporation ofthe soy protein isolate a ﬀects the morphology, resulting in a more spherical particle form. The utilisation of di ﬀerent pro- tein types a ﬀected the microstructure of the spray-dried pow- der conjugates.Similar particles were seen to dominate in thesoy protein-pectin (SPP) conjugate samples, but not in thewhey protein-pectin (WPP) conjugates.Ad iﬀerent phenomenon is also observed in the morpho- logical characteristics of powder conjugates that incorporatepectin.The morphology of whey protein-pectin (WPP) con-jugate particles resembles that of whey protein-maltodextrin(WPMD) particles; however, it has a reduced presence ofindentations and wrinkles.Similar results were observed when soy protein-maltodextrin (SPMD) and soy protein- pectin (SPP) particles.In SPMD, particles with concave sur-faces appear to dominate over SPPs.
Hence, it may be SPMD 1:2 SPMD 1:3 SPP 1:2 SPP 1:3 WPMD 1:2 WPMD 1:3 WPP 1:2 WPP 1:3 Figure 8: Visual appearance of conjugate spray-dried powder.15 International Journal of Food Science revealed that maltodextrin exerts a more signi ﬁcant impact on developing indentations and wrinkles in spray-driedpowder particles than whey protein. The morphological dis-tinctions between WPP and SPP particles are evident.Most soy protein-pectin (SPP) particles in Figure 9 have a spheri- cal morphology that is characterised by a smooth surface.Inaddition to the impact of the soy protein, the morphologicalcharacteristics of SPP were a ﬀected by pectin.With respect to Nagaraju et al.[55], the smooth surface may be attributedto robust cross-linked, elongated chain molecules.Similarresults were also stated by Pereira et al.[122], who used pec- tin to form the microstructure.
The concentration of polysaccharides (maltodextrin and pectin) in the mass ratio between protein and polysaccharide WPMD 1:2 WPMD 1:3 SPMD 1:2 SPMD 1:3 WPP 1:2 WPP 1:3 SPP 1:2 SPP 1:3 Figure 9: Surface morphology of conjugate spray-dried powder at a magni ﬁcation of 5000 times. WPMD: whey protein-maltodextrin; WPP: whey protein-pectin; SPMD: soy protein-maltodextrin; SPP: soy protein-pectin.16 International Journal of Food Science did not appear to a ﬀect the morphology of the conjugate particles produced.Observations showed that there was nodiﬀerence in particle shape between WPMD 1 : 2 and WPMD 1 : 3, as well as between SPMD 1 : 2 and SPMD1 : 3, between WPP 1 : 2 and WPP 1 : 3, and between SPP1 : 2 and SPP 1 : 3.The di ﬀerence in particle shape is more inﬂuenced by the type of protein and polysaccharide.4.
Conclusions The conjugation between plant protein (soy protein) and ani- mal protein (whey protein) with non-surface-active polysac-charide (maltodextrin) and surface-active polysaccharide(pectin) properties has been well demonstrated. Protein-polysaccharide conjugation through the Maillard reactionhas produced conjugate products with unique propertiesbased on visual appearance and surface morphology.Increas-ing conjugate product concentration tends to decrease sur-face tension.Conjugates containing whey protein tended tolower surface tension than those containing soy protein.Whey protein-pectin conjugates with a mass ratio of 1 : 2 and a concentration of 1% exhibit the lowest surface tensionat 43.77 dyne/cm 2.The emulsifying activity index was high- est in this conjugate sample at 27.18 m2/g.The emulsions using whey protein-maltodextrin conju- gates had droplet sizes smaller than those using other conju-gate types (256.5 nm).
However, the WPP showed betterpolydispersity index and zeta potential values, indicating thestability of the emulsion. The stability of conjugate productsagainst high temperatures was demonstrated by conjugatescontaining maltodextrin.The WPMD and WPP conjugates clearly show the presence of C=N groups at the 1644- 1645 cm -1peaks, indicating the success of the conjugation process.The fading or disappearance of protein bands andthe formation of polydispersed bands also prove the forma-tion of protein-polysaccharide conjugates.Based on these testresults, whey protein-pectin (WPP) and whey protein-maltodextrin (WPMD) have better emulsifying propertiesthan soy protein-pectin (SPP) and soy protein-maltodextrin(SPMD).
However, further research is needed to con ﬁrm and elaborate on the properties of whey protein-pectin andwhey protein-maltodextrin conjugates that may support theirability as emulsi ﬁers, including molecular weight, conjugation eﬃciency, conjugate yield, surface hydrophobicity, interfacial properties, and storage stability.
