Multiple linear regression model and quantile regression model were employed with the birth weight of newbornsandgestationalironsupplementationasdependentvariables and independent variables respectively, and controlling confounding factors.Results:Among the 24,952 women of childbearing age surveyed, multiple linear regression and quantile regression analysis showed that the birth weight of newborns whose mothers had iron sup- plementation during pregnancy were significantly higher than those w h o s em o t h e r sh a dn oi r o ns u p p l e m e n td u r i n gp r e g n a n c yf r o m very low to higher percentiles ( q=0–0.35,q=0.80), an average increase of 38.31 g(β=38.31,t=2.99 and P<0.01). With the increase of the percentiles of birth weight, the birth weight of newbornsincreasedeclinedgraduallyinthosewhosemothershadiron supplementation compared with those whose mothers had no iron supplementation.
Conclusions: Supplementation of iron during pregnancy can increase the neonatal birth weight, which has a greater effect in newborns with lower body weight than in newborns with higher body Weight.
