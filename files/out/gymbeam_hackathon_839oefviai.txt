Abstract: An innovative process for the adsorption of the hydrophobic Basil-Oil (BO) into the hy- drophilic food byproduct chitosan (CS) and the development of an advanced low-density polyethylene / chitosan/basil-oil (LDPE/CS_BO) active packaging ﬁlm was investigated in this work. The idea of this study was the use of the BO as both a bioactive agent and a compatibilizer.The CS was modiﬁed to a CS_BO hydrophobic blend via a green evaporation/adsorption process.This blend was incorpo- rated directly in the LDPE to produce ﬁlms with advanced properties.
All the obtained composite ﬁlms exhibited improved packaging properties. The ﬁlm with 10% CS_BO content exhibited the best packaging properties, i.e., 33.0% higher tensile stress, 31.0% higher water barrier, 54.3% higher oxygen barrier, and 12.3% higher antioxidant activity values compared to the corresponding values of the LDPE ﬁlms.The lipid oxidation values of chicken breast ﬁllets which were packaged under vacuum using this ﬁlm were measured after seven and after fourteen days of storage.These values were found to be lower by around 41% and 45%, respectively, compared with the corresponding lipid oxidation values of pure LDPE ﬁlm.Keywords: low density poly-ethylene; chitosan; basil oil; active packaging; barrier properties; lipid oxidation; shelf life 1.
Introduction The incorporation of biodegradable raw materials for the development of improved packaging, resulted from the global trend towards a cyclic economy and production techniques which exhibit positive environmental ﬁngerprint [ 1,2]. In this direction, the use of chitosan (CS) as an alternative to the synthetic polymers, provides promising results in active packaging issues.CS is a linear polysaccharide produced by treating chitin.Chitin mainly comes from crustaceans’ shells, which is a food byproduct.The CS based ﬁlms exhibited great potential for use as packaging materials with biodegradability, nontoxicity, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity [3].Although CS cannot be used directly in industrial extrusion molding processes, CS based materials have been recently reported as versatile and cost-competitive materials for various industrial applications [ 4–7].
To overcome the obstacles of this raw material use for such applications, the co-extrusion of the CS with synthetic polymers such as LDPE is proposed by researchers [ 8–13]. The blending of the CS with the LDPE requires a compatibilizer such as co-maleic anhydride [ 9].Park et al.[ 10] prepared LDPE/CS blends Molecules 2021 ,26, 1585.https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26061585 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules Molecules 2021 ,26, 1585 2 of 17 with low CS concentration, i.e., up to 8%, by using lactic acid as a compatibilizer.The incorporation of CS to LDPE decreased the tensile strength as well as both the water and oxygen barrier.When the obtained LDPE/CS ﬁlms were used for the storage of fresh red meat, microorganisms on the meat surface were not inhibited, but a signiﬁcant extension of red color shelf-life was observed in refrigerated sliced red meats.Reesha et al.
[ 11] developed LDPE/CS antimicrobial packaging ﬁlms with also low CS concentrations, i.e., up to 5%, by using maleic anhydride grafted LDPE (LDPE-g-MAH) as a compatible agent. In this case the CS incorporation to LDPE ﬁlms decreased tensile strength and water barrier, but at the same time the oxygen barrier was increased.Analysis of storage quality indexes such as peroxide value, free fatty acid, total volatile base nitrogen, and aerobic plate count, revealed a good antibacterial behavior and an extension of shelf life of Tilapia for the LDPE/CS composite ﬁlms compared to the pure LDPE ﬁlms.Wang et al.[ 13] developed LDPE/CS blends by using LDPE-g-MAH as a compatibilizer.The CS concentration in these ﬁlms was up to 10%.Results indicated that by increasing the CS concentration the tensile strength and the water barrier decreased, while oxygen barrier increased.Recently, Kusumastuti et al.
[ 9] prepared LDPE/CS blends with high CS concentration, i.e., up to 40%, by adding maleic anhydride (MA) and tert-butyl peroxybenzoate (TBPB) as a compatibilizer and initiator respectively. By increasing the CS concentration, the results showed an increase of tensile stress and biodegradability of the obtained LDPE/CS ﬁlms but no data on oxygen/water permeation were reported.Thus, in general, the use of compatibilizers improve the dispersion of CS into LDPE.Nevertheless, the LDPE/CS active ﬁlms still exhibited reduced tensile and water barrier properties, which are crucial for LDPE packaging ﬁlms.Nowadays, the trend in the food industry is to develop active packaging ﬁlms with non-synthetic antioxidants such as butyl-hydroxytoluene (BHT), butyl-hydroxyanisole (BHA), tert-butyl hydroxyquinone (TBHQ).The use of such synthetic antioxidants raises safety concerns for consumer health.
The last global effort is to replace these synthetic antioxidants with natural antioxidants such as essential oils and natural extracts [ 14,15]. Essential oils (EO) which were extracted from plants, have been used as seasoning agents in foods and beverages for centuries [ 16].Basil ( Ocimum basilicum L.) is a popular culinary herb, and its leaves contain essential oils which potentially could be used for applications in food products [ 17].Basil essential oil (BO) consists of more than 30 compounds, but the major components of this oil are estragole [ 18] and eugenol.The last one causes the strong clove scent of sweet basil [ 18,19].It has been proved that BO exhibits antimicrobial effect against different bacteria and different fungi [20].In the present work, the development, characterization, and packaging performance of a potentially active, packaging ﬁlm is studied.
This active packaging ﬁlm consists of three materials: (1) the LDPE which is one of the most widely used polymers for ﬂexible active packaging ﬁlms, (2) the food byproduct CS which is a biodegradable biopolymer with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, and which potentially could be used as packaging material, and (3) the extracted oil BO which exhibits antioxidant properties and antimicrobial effect against different bacteria. The main innovation in the current work is the use of BO as both an antioxidant agent and a compatibilizer.More speciﬁcally, this study aims to the development of a ﬁnal LDPE/CS_BO active ﬁlm without any loss in tensile and with higher water/oxygen barrier properties compared to the relevant properties of pure LDPE ﬁlm.Basil oil has been previously used as an active agent in LDPE [ 21] ﬁlms and in LDPE-based blends [ 22] but to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time used as both an active agent and as a compatibilizer.
For this reason, BO was ﬁrstly adsorbed into CS via a facile and green method, and a CS_BO blend was produced. Then, the hydrophobic CS_BO blend was incorporated into the LDPE chains in four different wt%.concentrations (i.e., 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt%.) via an one-step extrusion molding process.All the LDPE/CS_BO active packaging ﬁlms and the produced CS_BO blend characterized via various characterization techniques and the packaging performance was also investigated.The ﬁlm with the highest water/oxygen barrier, improved tensile Molecules 2021 ,26, 1585 3 of 17 properties, and antioxidant activity was further tested as an active packaging ﬁlm for chicken breast ﬁllets packaging under vacuum.The lipid oxidation value of these ﬁllets is determined as a ﬁnal validation parameter for packaging using these ﬁlms.2.Results 2.1.
XRD Analysis According to previous literature reports [ 23,24], XRD plots of the pure CS and CS_BO samples (see Figure 1) exhibit two broad peaks at 2 θ= 10.5◦and 2θ= 20.0◦. These peaks correspond to a hydrated crystalline structure and an amorphous CS, respectively [ 24].XRD plots of the CS_BO hybrid show a clear shift of both CS peaks to higher angles.This peak shift indicates the interaction between CS chains and BO molecules during the process of the CS_BO blend development [8].Molecules 2021, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 17 via various characterization techn iques and the packaging performance was also investi- gated.The film with the highest water/oxygen barrier, improved tensile properties, and antioxidant activity was further tested as an active packaging film for chicken breast fillets packaging under vacuu m.The lipid oxidation value of these fillets is determined as a final validation parameter for packaging using these films.2.Results 2.1.
XRD Analysis According to previous literature reports [23,24] , XRD plots of the pure CS and CS_BO samples (see Fig ure 1) exhibit two broad peaks at 2θ = 10.5 ° and 2θ = 20.0 °. These peaks correspond to a hydrated crystalline structure and an amorphous CS, respectively [24].XRD plots of the CS_BO hybrid show a clear shift of both CS peaks to hi gher angles.This peak shift indicates the interaction between CS chains and BO molecules during the pro- cess of the CS_BO blend development [8].Figure 1.(a) XRD plots of (1) raw chitosan ( CS) and (2) chitosan/basil -oil (CS_BO ) powders.( b) and inset ( c) XRD plots of (1) neat low -density polyethylene ( LDPE ), (2) LDPE/CS_BO5, (3) LDPE/CS_BO10, (4) LDPE/CS_BO20, (5) LDPE/CS_BO 30, and (6) CS_BO powder.As it is obvious from all XRD plots of LDPE/CS_BO composite films (see Fig ure 1 ), by increasing the CS_BO content, the characteristic peak of the CS at around 20 ° increases, and the LD PE's characteristic peaks shift to higher angles.
Both observations indicate the effective blending of LDPE chains with CS_BO blend. 2.2.FTIR Results Figure 2 depicts the FTIR spectra of the pure CS, of the modified CS_BO hybrid blend, and of all the LDPE /CS_BO films.FTIR spectra of the CS exhibit three main areas: (i) A broad asymmetric band between 3400 and 2500 cm−1.This band includes the CH stretch- ing modes at around 2900 and 2880 cm−1, and the overlapped OH and NH stretching vi- brations at higher wav enumbers (approximately 3400 cm−1); (ii) an area between 1700 and 1200 cm−1 which is characteristic of the amide groups; (iii) a strong absorption area be- tween 1200 and 800 cm−1 which is characteristic of the CS saccharide structure [8,10– 13] 5 10 15 20 25 30 (b) (6)(5) 2 thetaIntensity (arb.un.)(4)(3)(2)(1) 5 10 15 20 25 3020.0o 10.5o (1)(2)(a)Intensity (arb.un.) 2 theta Figure 1.(a) XRD plots of (1) raw chitosan (CS) and (2) chitosan/basil-oil (CS_BO) powders.

As it is obvious from all XRD plots of LDPE/CS_BO composite ﬁlms (see Figure 1), by increasing the CS_BO content, the characteristic peak of the CS at around 20◦increases, and the LDPE’s characteristic peaks shift to higher angles.Both observations indicate the effective blending of LDPE chains with CS_BO blend.2.2.FTIR Results Figure 2 depicts the FTIR spectra of the pure CS, of the modiﬁed CS_BO hybrid blend, and of all the LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlms.FTIR spectra of the CS exhibit three main areas: (i) A broad asymmetric band between 3400 and 2500 cm−1.
This band includes the CH stretching modes at around 2900 and 2880 cm−1, and the overlapped OH and NH stretching vibrations at higher wavenumbers (approximately 3400 cm−1); (ii) an area between 1700 and 1200 cm−1which is characteristic of the amide groups; (iii) a strong absorption area between 1200 and 800 cm−1which is characteristic of the CS saccharide structure [8,10–13]. The peaks at 1650 cm−1and at 1590 cm−1correspond to the stretching vibrations of the amide I (ν(C = O)) and the amide II ( ν(NH 2in NHCOCH 3)) groups.The peak at 1317 cm−1 corresponds to the bending vibration of the amide III group ( δ(C-H)) in pyranose ring characteristic vibrations.The peak at 1161 cm−1is attributed to the beta glycosidic bond between carbon 1 and carbon 4 of the CS.The peak at 1051 cm−1can be associated with the COC stretching of the glucopyranoside ring.Finally, peaks at 1420 cm−1and 1380 cm−1 represent the deformation bands of CH 2and CH 3[8,10–13].
After the incorporation of BO with the CS powder (see Figure 2a line (2)) two main peaks of BO [ 25] at approx. 1511 and 1547 cm−1obtained.These peaks reveal the adsorption of BO molecules into CS chains.Molecules 2021 ,26, 1585 4 of 17 Moreover, the signiﬁcant reduction of the CS_BO spectra compared to the CS spectra suggests a hydrogen bonding formation between BO components and CS chains [8,26].Molecules 2021, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 17 Figure 2.(a) FTIR spectra of (1) neat CS, and (2) CS_BO hybrid blend, (b ) FTIR spectra of (1) neat LDPE, (2) LDPE/CS_BO5, (3) LDPE/CS_BO10, (4) LDPE/CS_BO20, and LDPE/CS_BO30 films.The peaks at 1650 cm−1 and at 1590 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of the amide I (ν (C = O)) and the amide II (ν (NH 2 in NHCOCH 3)) groups.The peak at 1317 cm−1 corresponds to the bending vibration of the amide III gr oup (δ (C -H)) in pyranose ring characteristic vibrations.
The peak at 1161 cm−1 is attributed to the beta glycosidic bond between carbon 1 and carbon 4 of the CS. The peak at 1051 cm−1 can be associated with the COC stretching of the glucopyranoside ring.Finally, peaks at 1420 cm−1 and 1380 cm−1 represent the deformation bands of CH 2 and CH 3 [8,10 –13].After the incorporation of BO with the CS powder (see Fi gure 2a line (2)) two main peaks of BO [25] at approx.1511 and 1547 cm−1 obtained.These peaks reveal the ad sorption of BO molecules into CS chains.Moreover, the significant reduction of the CS_BO spectra compared to the CS spectra sug- gests a hydrogen bonding formation between BO components and CS chains [8,26] .In all FTIR plots of LDPE/CS_BO films, LDPE's characteristic peaks are observed [8,10– 12,27] .LDPE’s –CH 3 asymmetric stretching, –CH 2 wagging, and -CH 2 rocking, cor- respond to peaks at 1460 and 715 cm−1, while the LDPE’s –CH 2 symmetric stretching peaks are at 2913 and 2844 cm−1.
It is also evident from all the FTIR plots of the LDPE/CS_BO films that the characteristic peaks of the CS exi st in the range of 1900 –1400 cm−1 and 3800 – 3200 cm−1. As the CS content increases, the detected LDPE bands decrease, and the CS bands enhance.This fact indicates the effective blending of the CS_BO with the LDPE.According to theory and previous reports [8,27] , the interactions between chemical groups of dissimilar polymers could cause a position shift of peaks of the participating groups.In the present work, this kind of behavior is not ob served for specific peaks.This result in- dicates that the preparation procedure which was chosen for the development of CS_BO blend and the modification of the CS with BO led to a hydrophobic CS_BO hybrid blend, which can easily mixed with the LDPE chains in short processing time (5 min, see Table 3) and without the addition of a compatibilizer .2.3.
Thermogravimetric ( TG)/Diﬀerential Thermal Analysis ( DTA ) Results Figure 3 shows the TG plots for the neat CS, CS_BO blend, and for all the LDPE/CS_BO blends. Both the pure CS and the CS_BO blend exhibit two weight loss steps in the TG plots.The first weight loss step which starts at around 100 °C and ends at around 200 °C occurs due to the evaporation of the adsorbed moisture.The second weight -loss step, whic h is the main, starts at approx.230 ° C and ends at approx.550 °C.This is as- signed to the decomposition of the CS chains [28].It is evident from Fig ure 2a that the water weight loss step for the CS_BO hybrid blend, which occurs at around 100 –120 °C, is lower than the corresponding water weight loss step of the pure CS.This result indicates 1000 2000 3000 4000 1000 2000 3000 40001247cm-1 1511cm-1 basil oil1057cm-1 3400cm-12900-2880cm-1 1161cm-1 1317cm-11592cm -1 Wavelength (cm-1) (a)Transmitance (arb.

According to theory and previous reports [ 8,27], the interactions between chemical groups of dissimilar polymers could cause a position shift of peaks of the participating groups. In the present work, this kind of behavior is not observed for speciﬁc peaks.This result indicates that the preparation procedure which was chosen for the development of CS_BO blend and the modiﬁcation of the CS with BO led to a hydrophobic CS_BO hybrid blend, which can easily mixed with the LDPE chains in short processing time (5 min, see Table 3) and without the addition of a compatibilizer.2.3.Thermogravimetric (TG)/Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) Results Figure 3 shows the TG plots for the neat CS, CS_BO blend, and for all the LDPE/CS_BO blends.Both the pure CS and the CS_BO blend exhibit two weight loss steps in the TG plots.The ﬁrst weight loss step which starts at around 100◦C and ends at around 200◦C occurs due to the evaporation of the adsorbed moisture.
The second weight-loss step, which is the main, starts at approx. 230◦C and ends at approx.550◦C.This is assigned to the decomposition of the CS chains [ 28].It is evident from Figure 2a that the water weight loss step for the CS_BO hybrid blend, which occurs at around 100–120◦C, is lower than the corresponding water weight loss step of the pure CS.This result indicates that the hydrophobic CS_BO blend adsorbs less water than the hydrophilic pure CS.Furthermore, the decomposition weight loss step for the CS_BO blend starts at a temperature lower than this of the pure CS.Molecules 2021 ,26, 1585 5 of 17 Molecules 2021, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 17 that the hydrophobic CS_BO blend adsorbs less water than the hydrophilic pure CS.Fur- thermore, the decomposition weight loss step for the CS_BO blend starts at a temperatu re lower than this of the pure CS.Figure 3.

This result indicates the decrease of the thermal stability of the hydrophobically mod- ified CS_BO blends as it is compared to the thermal stability of the pure CS [8].The TG plot of the pure LDPE (see Figure 3a line 3) exhibits one weight loss step, which starts at around 395 °C [27].The decomposition pathway of the material derived by incorporating the CS_BO blend with the LDPE chains is more complex than this of the pure of the pure LDPE and exhibits t wo steps instead of one [29].By increasing the CS_BO content, these two weight loss decomposition steps of the TG p lot, are shifted in lower temperatures.This shift is better shown in the DTA plots of the LDPE/CS_BO composite films (see Fig.2b).
Thus, by increasing the CS_BO content, while the degradation temperature peak for LDPE is at 464.6 °C, the degradation temp erature peak for LDPE/CS_BO5, LDPE/CS_BO10, LDPE/CS_BO20, and LDPE/CS_BO30 composites decreases at 459, 457 455, and 451 °C respectively. As it was reported recently [9], the decrease in degradation temperature of the LDPE/CS_BO blends by increasing the CS concentration, is a thermal behavior similar with this e xhibited by the LDPE/CS blends.2.4.DSC Results Figure 4 presents the DSC curves of the LDPE/CS_BO films.Th e calculated charac- teristic temperatures and the fusion enthalpies are listed in Table 1.Table 1.Melting point temperature, fusion enthalpy values among with Modulus of elasticity (E), tensile strength (σ uts), and % elongation at break (ε b) of all tested LDPE/CS_BO films.

This result indicates the decrease of the thermal stability of the hydrophobically modiﬁed CS_BO blends as it is compared to the thermal stability of the pure CS [ 8]. The TG plot of the pure LDPE (see Figure 3a line 3) exhibits one weight loss step, which starts at around 395◦C [27].The decomposition pathway of the material derived by incorporating the CS_BO blend with the LDPE chains is more complex than this of the pure of the pure LDPE and exhibits two steps instead of one [ 29].By increasing the CS_BO content, these two weight loss decomposition steps of the TG plot, are shifted in lower temperatures.This shift is better shown in the DTA plots of the LDPE/CS_BO composite ﬁlms (see Figure 2b).Thus, by increasing the CS_BO content, while the degradation temperature peak for LDPE is at 464.6◦C, the degradation temperature peak for LDPE/CS_BO5, LDPE/CS_BO10, LDPE/CS_BO20, and LDPE/CS_BO30 composites decreases at 459, 457 455, and 451◦C respectively.
As it was reported recently [ 9], the decrease in degradation temperature of the LDPE/CS_BO blends by increasing the CS concentration, is a thermal behavior similar with this exhibited by the LDPE/CS blends. 2.4.DSC Results Figure 4 presents the DSC curves of the LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlms.The calculated character- istic temperatures and the fusion enthalpies are listed in Table 1.Molecules 2021, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 17 The LDPE exhibits a melting temperature peak at around 111 °C, while the compo- sites exhibit a melting temperature peak at around 107 –109 °C.A decrease in melting tem- perature value of the LDPE/CS blends is also reported by Kusumastuti et al.[9].Moreover, the LDPE shows a fusion enthalpy value of 113.5 J/g while the composites show fusion enthalpy values in the range 79 –104 J/g.The LDPE/CS_BO10 sample exhibits the higher enthalpy value as it is compared to the corresponding values of the other composites (i.e., 103.4 J/g).
This is the closest value to the value of the pure LDPE. Thus, this material is more difficult to melt than the other composites.The melting con ditions are close to the melting conditions of the pure LDPE film.Therefore, comparing the melting process of the LDPE film with the melting process of the LDPE/CS_BO10 film, no significant differ- ences are introduced by the CS addition.Figure 4.DSC curves of pure LDPE and LDPE/CS_BO composites.2.5.SEM Morphology The surface morphology of all the LDPE/CS_BO films was analyzed using a scanning electron microscopy.Fig ure 5 shows the SEM images of all the LDPE/CS_BO films under ×500 magnification.It is obvious from Figure 5 that the folds and the wrinkles are much more visible on the SEM images (a) and (b) ( LDPE/CS_ BO5, LDPE/CS_ BO10 films) than on the SEM images (c) and (d) (LDPE/CS_ BO20 and LDPE/CS _BO30 films).Thus, it could be stated that there are differences on the surface s of the obtained LDPE/CS_BO films .

A decrease in melting temper- ature value of the LDPE/CS blends is also reported by Kusumastuti et al.[ 9].Moreover, the LDPE shows a fusion enthalpy value of 113.5 J/g while the composites show fusion enthalpy values in the range 79–104 J/g.The LDPE/CS_BO10 sample exhibits the higher enthalpy value as it is compared to the corresponding values of the other composites (i.e., 103.4 J/g).This is the closest value to the value of the pure LDPE.Thus, this material is more difﬁcult to melt than the other composites.
The melting conditions are close to the melting conditions of the pure LDPE ﬁlm. Therefore, comparing the melting process of the LDPE ﬁlm with the melting process of the LDPE/CS_BO10 ﬁlm, no signiﬁcant differences are introduced by the CS addition.2.5.SEM Morphology The surface morphology of all the LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlms was analyzed using a scanning electron microscopy.Figure 5 shows the SEM images of all the LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlms under ×500 magniﬁcation.It is obvious from Figure 5 that the folds and the wrinkles are much more visible on the SEM images (a) and (b) (LDPE/CS_BO5, LDPE/CS_BO10 ﬁlms) than on the SEM images (c) and (d) (LDPE/CS_BO20 and LDPE/CS_BO30 ﬁlms).Thus, it could be stated that there are differences on the surfaces of the obtained LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlms.Molecules 2021, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 17 The LDPE exhibits a melting temperature peak at around 111 °C, while the compo- sites exhibit a melting temperature peak at around 107 –109 °C.

At the same time, by increasing the CS_B O content, the tensile strength decreases, and the % elongation at break decreases further. The increase of the brittle material content such as CS, results to a decrease of ductility [30].Figure 6.Strain–stress curves of (1 ) LDPE, (2) LDPE/CS_BO5, (3) LDPE/CS_BO10, (4) LDPE/CS_BO20, and (5) LDPE/CS_BO30.The decrease of tensile strength and of the elongation at break values by increasing the CS concentration was also observed in several previous studies studies [10,11,13] .In these studies [10,11,13] , the CS concentrations range from 1 to 10%.Recently, Kusumastuti et al.[9] prepared LDPE/CS blends with CS concentration up to 40% wt.This became fea- sible by adding maleic anhydride (MA) and tert-butyl peroxybenzoate (TBPB) as a com- patibilizer and initiator, respectively.The obtained LDPE/CS films exhibited b etter tensile stress and strength values compared to the values of pure LDPE films.
In this work, the CS concentration range from 5 to 30% wt. and a significant increase in tensile stress values recorded by increasing the CS concentration.Thus, the mechani cal properties reported in this paper are similar to those reported recently by Kusumastuti et al .[9].This fact indi- cates the successful use of the BO as a compatib ilizer and implies the good dispersion of the CS_BO blend in the LDPE matrix.The homogeneous blending of the CS_BO with the LDPE chains is also supported by the SEM images of such films, where a good dispersion of the CS_BO blend in the LDPE chains was re corded.This homogeneity enhances the tensile stress values of all the obtained LDPE/CS_BO films.Figure 7 presents the percentage of variation of the Young's Modulus (E) and the % elongation at break (ε) values of each sample vs.the corresponding values of the LDPE.
Figure 4 indicates the 10% CS_BO loading is the optimum loading to achieve a significant increase of endurance in tensile stress without a significant decrease in the tensile strain of the same property. As a conclusion from the tensile measurements, we could say that LDPE/CS_BO10 sample exhibited the optimum tensile properties.Figure 6.Strain–stress curves of (1) LDPE, (2) LDPE/CS_BO5, (3) LDPE/CS_BO10, (4) LDPE/CS_BO20, and (5) LDPE/CS_BO30.By increasing the CS_BO content in the LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlms, the Young’s Modulus (E) increases.This behavior is typical for thermoplastic materials blended with brittle materials such as CS [ 8,30].At the same time, by increasing the CS_BO content, the tensile strength decreases, and the % elongation at break decreases further.The increase of the brittle material content such as CS, results to a decrease of ductility [30].
The decrease of tensile strength and of the elongation at break values by increasing the CS concentration was also observed in several previous studies studies [10,11,13]. In these studies [ 10,11,13], the CS concentrations range from 1 to 10%.Recently, Kusumastuti et al.[9] prepared LDPE/CS blends with CS concentration up to 40 wt%.This became feasible by adding maleic anhydride (MA) and tert-butyl peroxybenzoate (TBPB) as a compatibilizer and initiator, respectively.The obtained LDPE/CS ﬁlms exhibited better tensile stress and strength values compared to the values of pure LDPE ﬁlms.In this work, the CS concentration range from 5 to 30 wt%.and a signiﬁcant increase in tensile stress values recorded by increasing the CS concentration.Thus, the mechanical properties reported in this paper are similar to those reported recently by Kusumastuti et al.[ 9].
This fact indicates the successful use of the BO as a compatibilizer and implies the good dispersion of the CS_BO blend in the LDPE matrix. The homogeneous blending of the CS_BO with the LDPE chains is also supported by the SEM images of such ﬁlms, where a good dispersion of the CS_BO blend in the LDPE chains was recorded.This homogeneity enhances the tensile stress values of all the obtained LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlms.Figure 7 presents the percentage of variation of the Young’s Modulus (E) and the % elongation at break ( ε) values of each sample vs.the corresponding values of the LDPE.Figure 4 indicates the 10% CS_BO loading is the optimum loading to achieve a signiﬁcant increase of endurance in tensile stress without a signiﬁcant decrease in the tensile strain of the same property.As a conclusion from the tensile measurements, we could say that LDPE/CS_BO10 sample exhibited the optimum tensile properties.Molecules 2021 ,26, 1585 8 of 17 Molecules 2021, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 17 Figure 7.

To conclude, the water sorption meas- urements show that LDPE/CS_BO5 and LDPE/CS_BO10 samples exhibited the lowest wa- ter sorption values.

The obtained WVTR values of this work cannot be com- pared with corresponding values reported in literature because the measuring technique followed in this work was developed by our lab -team and is not a regularly used method. Thus, the WVTR results are useful only for comparisons between the tested samples of this work.Fig ure 8 depicts the % variation of WVTR values compared to the WVTR value of the original LDPE film.Figure 7.% variation of mean values of the Young’s Modulus–E values, and of the mean values of the %elongation at break–% εvalues for all tested the LDPE/CS_BO active packaging ﬁlms.2.7.Water Sorption The calculated % water sorption values of all the obtained composite LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlms as well as of the LDPE ﬁlm are listed in Table 2 [ 9].As the CS_BO content increases, the % water sorption increases too.
Although the increase of the water sorption values should be expected in the case of a hydrophilic biopolymer addition (i.e., CS) to LDPE, it must be noted that the values reported in this work are lower than the water sorption values reported elsewhere [ 27] and close to the low water sorption values reported recently by Kusumastuti et al.

Molecules 2021 ,26, 1585 9 of 17 Molecules 2021, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 17 The WVTR values of the LDPE/CS_BO5 and the LDPE/CS_BO10 samples are lower than the WVTR value of the pure LDPE film at around 26.4% and 31.0% , respectively. On the contrary , for the LDPE/CS_BO20 and the LDPE/CS_30 samples, the re spective WVTR values are higher than the WVTR value of the pure LDPE film.In all previous works [8,10,11,13] , the obtained LDPE/CS films lost their excellent wate r vapor transmission properties as compared to the pure LDPE film.The hygroscopic CS acts as a water pas- sageway into the LDPE film matrix.This fact promotes significantly film’s WVTR proper- ties [10,11,13] .It is the first time where a decrease in WVTR values by adding CS in LDPE matrix is reported.This behavior must be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the used CS_BO blend.Moreover, the WVTR values and the water sorption values exhibited a sim- ilar trend.
According to the water vapor transmission rate measurements, the LDPE/CS_BO10 sample exhibited the lowest WVTR value . Figure 8.% Water Vapor Transmission Rate ( WVTR) and Oxygen Permeability ( OP) mean value variation of each LDPE/CS_BO composite sample as compared to the mean values of the WVTR and OP of pure LDPE film.2.9.Oxygen Permeability (OP) It is obvious from the OP value s, which are listed in Table 2, that the incorporation of the CS_BO blend with the LDPE matrix increases the oxygen barrier of all the obtained LDPE/CS_BO composite films compared to the OP values of the pure LDPE film.This result is similar with the results reported in other previous publications [11,13] where the CS addition improves significantly the oxygen barrier performance of the LDPE/CS films because of the presence of polar interactions in its structure [13].The Figure 9 plots are present the % variation of the OP values of each sample vs.the OP value of the pure LDPE film.
Thu s, the OP values of the LDPE/CS_BO5, LDPE/CS_BO10, LDPE/CS_BO20, and LDPE/CS_BO30 films are lower than the OP value of the pure LDPE film at around 36.7%, 54.3%, 57.0% and 55.2 , respectively. The LDPE/CS_BO10 sample exhibits the highest wa- ter and oxygen ba rrier values.2.10.Overall Migration Rate All the obtained LDPE/CS_BO samples exhibited higher values than the correspond- ing values of the “blank” LDPE sample.By increasing the CS concentration, the OMR values of the LDPE/CS_BO films increased.This trend is also observed by Reesha et al.[11].Nevertheless, the overall migration values (OMR) of all the LDPE/CS_BO films are 5 10 15 20 25 30-60-50-40-30-20-10010 -55.2-57.0-54.3-36.7+6.3 -1.9 -31.0 WVTR OP% variation % CS_BO content-26.4 highest water/oxygen barrier Figure 8.% Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR) and Oxygen Permeability (OP) mean value variation of each LDPE/CS_BO composite sample as compared to the mean values of the WVTR and OP of pure LDPE ﬁlm.
The WVTR values of the LDPE/CS_BO5 and the LDPE/CS_BO10 samples are lower than the WVTR value of the pure LDPE ﬁlm at around 26.4% and 31.0%, respectively. On the contrary, for the LDPE/CS_BO20 and the LDPE/CS_30 samples, the respective WVTR values are higher than the WVTR value of the pure LDPE ﬁlm.In all previous works [8,10,11,13] , the obtained LDPE/CS ﬁlms lost their excellent water vapor transmis- sion properties as compared to the pure LDPE ﬁlm.The hygroscopic CS acts as a water passageway into the LDPE ﬁlm matrix.This fact promotes signiﬁcantly ﬁlm’s WVTR properties [ 10,11,13].It is the ﬁrst time where a decrease in WVTR values by adding CS in LDPE matrix is reported.This behavior must be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the used CS_BO blend.Moreover, the WVTR values and the water sorption values exhibited a similar trend.According to the water vapor transmission rate measurements, the LDPE/CS_BO10 sample exhibited the lowest WVTR value.2.9.
Oxygen Permeability (OP) It is obvious from the OP values, which are listed in Table 2, that the incorporation of the CS_BO blend with the LDPE matrix increases the oxygen barrier of all the obtained LDPE/CS_BO composite ﬁlms compared to the OP values of the pure LDPE ﬁlm. This result is similar with the results reported in other previous publications [ 11,13] where the CS addition improves signiﬁcantly the oxygen barrier performance of the LDPE/CS ﬁlms because of the presence of polar interactions in its structure [ 13].The Figure 9 plots are present the % variation of the OP values of each sample vs.the OP value of the pure LDPE ﬁlm.Thus, the OP values of the LDPE/CS_BO5, LDPE/CS_BO10, LDPE/CS_BO20, and LDPE/CS_BO30 ﬁlms are lower than the OP value of the pure LDPE ﬁlm at around 36.7%, 54.3%, 57.0% and 55.2%, respectively.The LDPE/CS_BO10 sample exhibits the highest water and oxygen barrier values.

The low- est OMR values are obtained for LDPE/CS_BO5 and LDPE/CS_BO10 films.Thus, such films could be m ore suitable for food packaging applications.2.11.Antioxidant Activity By increasing the CS_BO content the antioxidant activity values of the LDPE/CS_BO active films also increased (see Table 2).The estimated values are 6.4% for the LDPE/CS_BO5, 12.8% for the LDPE/CS_BO10, 22.4% for the LDPE/CS_BO20 , and 34.6% for the LDPE/CS_BO30 sample.2.12.Lipid Oxidation Figure 9 plots present the calculated TBARS values of chicken breast fillets which were packaged with the most active film , i.e., the LDPE/CS_BO10 film, as well as with the “blank” LDPE film.The storage period was seven (7) and fourteen (14) days and the stor- age temperature was 4 °C.
The initial TBARS values of chicken breast fillets were esti- mated at around 0.14 mg MDA/kg. Such values are consistent with others reported pre- viously [31,32].Figure 9.TBARS values of chicken breast fillets vacuum packaged with LDPE, and LDPE/CS_BO10 film after 0, 7 , and 14 days of storage at 4 °C.The TBARS values of chicken breast fillets packaged with “control” LDPE film, were measured after storage under vacuum, at 4 °C, for seven and fourteen days.These values were found 0.72 and 1.68 mg MDA/Kg meat , respective ly.The TBARS values for the same storage conditions, packaged with LDPE/CS_BO10 active film , were found 0.43 and 0.92 mg MDA/Kg meat , respectively.Chicken breast fillet , which was packaged with “control” LDPE film and stored for fourteen days exhibited , had TBARS values limited below 2 mg/kg.This value is the threshold at which an odor becomes noticeable because signifi- cant lipid oxidation occurs [33].
The TBARS value of chicken breast fillet , which was pack- aged and stored for fourteen days, but with the LDPE/CS_BO10 active packaging film was well below the 2 mg/kg threshold. Moreover, the TBARS values for chicken breast fillet, which was packaged with LDPE/CS_BO10 film and stored for seven and after fourteen days, was found to be lower , at around 41% and 45% , respectively , compared to the TBARS values for chicken breast fillet, which was packaged with “control” LDPE film and stored for the same time periods.Thus, the antioxidant activity and the improved barrier properties of LDPE/CS_BO10 film extends the storage period of chicken breast fillets which w ere packaged at 4 °C under vacuum.0 7 140.00.30.60.91.21.51.8 LDPE LDPE/CS_BO10TBRS mg/Kg MDA days of storage Figure 9.TBARS values of chicken breast ﬁllets vacuum packaged with LDPE, and LDPE/CS_BO10 ﬁlm after 0, 7, and 14 days of storage at 4◦C.2.10.
Overall Migration Rate All the obtained LDPE/CS_BO samples exhibited higher values than the correspond- ing values of the “blank” LDPE sample. By increasing the CS concentration, the OMR values of the LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlms increased.This trend is also observed by Reesha et al.[ 11].Nevertheless, the overall migration values (OMR) of all the LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlms are found to be lower than the maximum permissible limit of 60 mg/L (see Table 2).The lowest OMR values are obtained for LDPE/CS_BO5 and LDPE/CS_BO10 ﬁlms.Thus, such ﬁlms could be more suitable for food packaging applications.2.11.Antioxidant Activity By increasing the CS_BO content the antioxidant activity values of the LDPE/CS_BO active films also increased (see T able 2).The estimated values are 6.4% for the LDPE/CS_BO5, 12.8% for the LDPE/CS_BO10, 22.4% for the LDPE/CS_BO20, and 34.6% for the LDPE/CS_BO30 sample.2.12.
Lipid Oxidation Figure 9 plots present the calculated TBARS values of chicken breast ﬁllets which were packaged with the most active ﬁlm, i.e., the LDPE/CS_BO10 ﬁlm, as well as with the “blank” LDPE ﬁlm. The storage period was seven (7) and fourteen (14) days and the storage temperature was 4◦C.The initial TBARS values of chicken breast ﬁllets were estimated at around 0.14 mg MDA/kg.Such values are consistent with others reported previously [31,32].The TBARS values of chicken breast ﬁllets packaged with “control” LDPE ﬁlm, were measured after storage under vacuum, at 4◦C, for seven and fourteen days.These values were found 0.72 and 1.68 mg MDA/Kg meat, respectively.The TBARS values for the same storage conditions, packaged with LDPE/CS_BO10 active ﬁlm, were found 0.43 and 0.92 mg MDA/Kg meat, respectively.Chicken breast ﬁllet, which was packaged with “control” LDPE ﬁlm and stored for fourteen days exhibited, had TBARS values limited below 2 mg/kg.
This value is the threshold at which an odor becomes noticeable because signiﬁcant lipid oxidation occurs [ 33]. The TBARS value of chicken breast ﬁllet, which was packaged and stored for fourteen days, but with the LDPE/CS_BO10 active packaging ﬁlm was well below the 2 mg/kg threshold.Moreover, the TBARS values for chicken breast ﬁllet, which was packaged with LDPE/CS_BO10 ﬁlm and stored for seven and after fourteen days, was found to be lower, at around 41% and 45%, respectively, compared to the TBARS values for chicken breast ﬁllet, which was packaged with “control” LDPE ﬁlm and stored for the same time periods.Thus, the antioxidant activity and the improved Molecules 2021 ,26, 1585 11 of 17 barrier properties of LDPE/CS_BO10 ﬁlm extends the storage period of chicken breast ﬁllets which were packaged at 4◦C under vacuum.2.13.Statistical Analysis of the Experimental Data The used conﬁdence interval for all tests is the most common value of C.I.= 95%.
Thus, the value of the statistical signiﬁcance level is p= 0.05. The inﬂuence of the different compositions on the ﬁnal product properties was statistically conﬁrmed starting with the hypothesis H0: (Mean values of this property could be assumed as equal for all different compositions).This was performed for supporting the hypothesis that every parameter has a statistically different mean value considering samples with different CS_BO compositions.We used the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis method, and the results are presented in Table 3.Comparing the Sig.values from Table 3 with the signiﬁcance level p= 0.05, it is obvious that in all cases and for all parameters, the mean values are statistically different.
According to the developed empirical equation that is reported in the in the literature [ 34] and concerns the calculation of an empirical factor, the so-called “inequality assurance” (IA), it is obvious from Table 4 that in all cases the inequality of mean values is statistically assured strongly (IA >= 88%).

Preparation of CS_BO Hybrid Blend Modiﬁed CS_BO hybrid blend was prepared via a green evaporation method. This method is similar to a method previously reported in the literature for the modiﬁcation of clays with thyme, oregano, and basil oil [ 25].This method blended successfully the CS with the most volatile fraction of the EO.The preparation method of this study exploits the advantage of the BO evaporation ability and the CS adsorption capacity to prepare an improved CS_BO blend, which can easily be used as a masterbatch in the packaging industry.An amount of 10 g of CS (see Figure 10(ii)) was spread in an aluminum beaker.In the middle of this aluminum beaker, a smaller quartz beaker was placed and ﬁlled with 10 g of BO (see Figure 10(i)).The whole “apparatus” was sealed and put in an oven at 120◦C for 24 h.Under these conditions, the most volatile BO components were evaporated and adsorbed into the CS (see Figure 10 ).
Following this green method, the use of organic solvents was avoided, and the CS adsorbed as much BO as it could. Moreover, the produced CS_BO hybrid is in powder form (see Figure 10 ) and can be accurately weighed and used as a masterbatch in industry and incorporated in the extruder to produce the packaging ﬁlm.The obtained BO loading on CS was calculated gravimetrically and was approx.18.5 wt%.Molecules 2021, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 17 3.2.Preparation Methods 3.2.1.Preparation of CS_BO Hybrid Blend Modified CS_BO hybrid blend was prepared via a green evaporation method.This method is similar to a method previously reported in the literature for the modification of clays with thyme, oregano, and basil oil [25].This method blended successfully the CS with the most volatile fraction of the EO.
The preparation method of this study exploits the advant age of the BO evaporation ability and the CS adsorption capacity to prepare an improved CS_BO blend, which can easily be used as a masterbatch in the packaging industry. An amount of 10 g of CS (see Figure 10(ii)) was spread in an aluminum beaker.In the m iddle of this aluminum beaker, a smaller quartz beaker was placed and filled with 10 g of BO (see Fig ure 10 (i)).The whole “apparatus” was sealed and put in an oven at 120 °C for 24 h.Under these conditions, the most volatile BO components were evaporate d and adsorbed into the CS (see Fig ure 10).Following this green method, the use of organic solvents was avoided, and the CS ad- sorbed as much BO as it could.Moreover, the produced CS_BO hybrid is in powder form (see Figure 10) and can be accurately weighe d and used as a masterbatch in industry and incorporated in the extruder to produce the packaging film.
The obtained BO loading on CS was calculated gravimetrically and was approx. 18.5%wt.Figure 10.Upper part: Schematic representation of the green evaporation/adsorption process ap- plied for the preparation of BO_CS nanostructure, (i) glass beaker with BO, (ii) spread CS at the bottom of the aluminum beaker, (iii) process of BO evaporation and adsorption into CS.Down part: (1) Image of raw CS powder and (2) modified CS_BO nanostructure .3.2.2.Preparation of LDPE/CS_BO Active Films The LDPE/CS_BO films were produced via a melt mixing process using a minilab twin co-rotating extruder.The uniform operating temperature of the melt process was 140 °C and the screw speed was 100 rpm.The total processing time was 5 min.The nominal composition of the used CS_BO blend was fixed at 5, 10, 20, and 30 %wt.The produced melted material was cut into small granules using a granulated ma- chine.The final films were produced by a hot -pressing process.
Approximately, 1g of granules were pressed at 110 °C under 2.0 MPa constant pressure for 3 min, using a hy- draulic press with heated platens. Finally, a sample of pure LDPE is also extruded and used as reference sample fo r comparison reasons.In Table 4 is presented the code names of all the produced samples, the used amounts of the LDPE and CS_BO material, and the extruder processing conditions for the preparation of all the LDPE/CS_BO active films.3.3.XRD Analysis The morphological characteristics of the CS_BO and neat CS powders, and of all the produced films were investigated via XRD measurements using a Brüker D8 Advance X - ray diﬀractometer (Brüker, Analytical Instruments, S.A.Athens, Greece) equipped with a LINXEYE XE High -Resolution Energy -Dispersive detector.Typical scanning parameters Figure 10.

Finally, a sample of pure LDPE is also extruded and used as reference sample for comparison reasons. In Table 4 is presented the code names of all the produced samples, the used amounts of the LDPE and CS_BO material, and the extruder processing conditions for the preparation of all the LDPE/CS_BO active ﬁlms.3.3.XRD Analysis The morphological characteristics of the CS_BO and neat CS powders, and of all the produced ﬁlms were investigated via XRD measurements using a Brüker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Brüker, Analytical Instruments, S.A.Athens, Greece) equipped with a LINXEYE XE High-Resolution Energy-Dispersive detector.Typical scanning parameters Molecules 2021 ,26, 1585 13 of 17 were set as follows: Two theta range 2–30◦for powder as well as for ﬁlm samples; increment 0.03◦; PSD 0.764.3.4.FTIR Spectrometry The chemical structure of the CS_BO and neat CS powders and of the produced ﬁlms (pure LDPE and LDPE/CS_BO composite ﬁlms) was investigated by IR spectra measurements.
Infrared (FTIR) spectra, which were the average of 32 scans at 2 cm−1 resolution, measured with an FT/IR-6000 JASCO Fourier transform spectrometer (JASCO, Interlab, S.A., Athens, Greece) in the frequency range 4000–400 cm−1. 3.5.Thermal Studies TG-DTA/DSC Thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were performed on pure CS, modiﬁed CS_BO hybrid blend, and all the produced LDPE/CS_BO samples.Measurements performed by a Perkin-Elmer Pyris Diamond TGA/DTA instrument (In- terlab, S.A., Athens, Greece).Samples of approximately 5 mg were heated under an N 2 ﬂow, from 25 to 700 °C, with a temperature increasing rate of 5 K/min.The thermal be- havior of the obtained LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlm and of the reference LDPE ﬁlm was also studied using a DSC214 Polyma Differential Scanning Calorimeter (NETZSCH manufacturer, Selb, Germany).Samples between 1.2–3.3 mg were tested in the temperature range from −30 to 200◦C at a heating rate of 10 K/min under a nitrogen atmosphere.3.6.
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of LDPE/CS_BO Blends Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JSM-6510 LV SEM Microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an X-Act EDS-detector by Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK (an acceleration voltage of 5 kV was applied). The specimens were sputtered with an Au-Pd thin ﬁlm (4–8 nm) using a mini sputter coater SC7620 from Quorum Technologies LTD (Kent, UK).3.7.Tensile Properties Tensile measurements were carried out on all the produced LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlms and were compared with the relevant measurements of the “blank” LDPE ﬁlm.The measurement procedure was according to the ASTM D638 method using a Simantzü AX-G 5kNt instrument (Simantzu.Asteriadis, S.A., Athens, Greece).Three to ﬁve samples of each ﬁlm were tested at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min.The samples were dumbbell-shaped with gauge dimensions of 10 mm ×3 mm ×0.22 mm.Force (N) and displacement (mm) were recorded during the test.3.8.
Water Sorption Water sorption measurements were carried out following a methodology, which was de- scribed previously [ 35,36]. The obtained films were cut into small pieces ( 12 mm ×12 mm ), desiccated overnight under vacuum, and weighed to determine their dry mass.The weighed ﬁlms were placed in closed beakers containing 30 mL of water (pH = 7) and stored at T = 25◦C.The sorption plots were developed by the periodical weighting of the samples until sorption equilibrium was reached.The Equation (1) used for such calculations was: W.S.(%) = (m Wet×mDry)/m Dry×100 (1) where m Wetand m Dryare the weight of the wet and dry ﬁlm, respectively, and W.S.is the Water sorption.3.9.Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR) WVTR of all the obtained ﬁlms was determined.Experimental conditions were ﬁxed at 38◦C and 50% RH according to the ASTM E96/E 96M-05 method using a handmade apparatus according to previous reports [23,37,38].
Circular disk ﬁlms with 10 µm average thickness and 2.5 cm diameter were placed on the top of plexiglass cylindrical tubes Molecules 2021 ,26, 1585 14 of 17 with closed bottoms as was described in detail in the above mentioned publications. These cylindrical tubes contained dried silica gel inside, and the ﬁlms were sealed with a rubber O-ring.The devices were placed in a glass desiccator which contains 200 mL of saturated magnesium nitrate solution (50% RH).Each ﬁlm was weighed before and after the measurement to ensure that no water adsorption or dissolution phenomena occurred during the experiment.Tested cylinders were weighed periodically for 24 h and the WVP was calculated according to Equation (2): WVP = ( ∆G/t)/A (2) where ∆G is the weight that the tested cylinders gained in g, t is the time in hours, and A is the permeated area of the ﬁlm.The ∆G/t term is estimated by the slope of the ﬁtted straight line over the ∆G = f(t) plot scattering.3.10.
Oxygen Permeability (OP) The oxygen transition rate (OTR) of all the obtained LDPE/CS_BO and neat LDPE ﬁlms was measured using an oxygen permeation analyzer (8001, Systech Illinois Instru- ments Co., Johnsburg, IL, USA). All samples were tested at 23◦C and 0% RH according to the ASTM D 3985 method.OTR values were expressed at cc O 2/m2/day.The OP values of the tested samples were calculated by multiplying the OTR values with an average ﬁlm thickness of around 350–400 µm.The mean OTR value for each kind of ﬁlm resulted from the measurements of three samples.3.11.Overall Migration Test The overall migration measurements of all the LDPE/CS_BO ﬁlms were carried out according to the USFDA 176:170 test procedure [ 39].Samples of each ﬁlm were cut to produce specimens of 1 dm2and immersed in a glass tube with 250 mL of stimulating solvent (water) at 49◦C for 24 h.After exposure to the atmosphere for a speciﬁed duration, the ﬁlm was dried, and the solvent evaporated.
The residues were weighed, and the overall migration residue (OMR) values were calculated according to the Equation (3): OMR in mg/L = (mass of residue (mg) ×1000) /(Volume of stimulant (mL)) (3) 3.12. Antioxidant Activity The antioxidant activity of ﬁlms evaluated according to a methodology which was described previously [ 40], but with small modiﬁcations.An amount of 500 mg of small pieces (approximately 3 mm ×3 mm) of each ﬁlm was used.The sample was placed in a dark-colored glass bottle with a plastic screw cap and ﬁlled with 10 mL ethanolic solution of DPPH, 50 ppm (mg/L).After incubation at 25◦C for 24 h in darkness, the % antioxidant activity values of the ﬁlms were calculated according to the Equation (4): % Antioxidant activity = (Abs control×Abs sample )/Abs control )×100 (4) 3.13.Lipid Oxidation Test The lipid oxidation test was carried out according to a methodology which was described previously [ 31] but with small modiﬁcations.
Brieﬂy, for the packaging of each piece of freshly skinned and deboned chicken breasts (around 20 g each), two disk-shaped ﬁlms with a 10 cm diameter and a 0.06 mm average thickness were used. The chosen ﬁlm for lipid oxidation experiments was the LDPE/CS_BO10.This ﬁlm exhibited the highest water/oxygen barrier, improved tensile properties, and improved antioxidant activity.For “blank” measurements, two neat LDPE disk-ﬁlms were used.The two disk-shaped samples (10 cm diameter, 100 µm thickness) of each ﬁlm were put inside a commercial polyethylene (PE) packaging bag, (see Figure 11).For reliable results, three samples of each ﬁlm were tested, and the measurements were analyzed statistically.To avoid cross-contamination, all used utensils, including the disk-shaped ﬁlms and PE packaging bags were sanitized Molecules 2021 ,26, 1585 15 of 17 with ethanol.The samples were packed under vacuum using a vacuum sealer machine SFS 120 A1 and stored at temperature of 4◦C.
A batch of samples was stored for seven days while another batch was stored for fourteen days. All samples were analyzed following the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) method.The determination of their lipid oxidation degree was carried out according to a methodology which was described previously [34,41].Molecules 2021, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 17 ples (10 cm diameter, 100 μm thickness) of each film were put inside a commercial poly- ethylene (PE) packaging bag, (see Figure 11).For reliable results, three samples of each film were tested, and the me asurements were analyzed statistically.To avoid cross -con- tamination, all used utensils, including the disk -shaped films and PE packaging bags were sanitized with ethanol.Τhe samples were packed under vacuum using a vacuum sealer machine SFS 120 A1 and st ored at temperature of 4 °C.A batch of samples was stored for seven days while another batch was stored for fourteen days.
All samples were analyzed following the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) method. The determination of their lipid oxid ation degree was carried out according to a methodology which was described previously [34,41].Figure 11.Chicken breast fillets vacuum packaged with (1) “control” LDPE film, (2) LDPE/CS_BO10 film, and (3) package foil.3.14.Statistical Analysis All measurements were carried out at least in triplicate for each sample.The statisti- cal analysis was performed using the Statistical Package SPSS 20 for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).The mean values and standard deviation are presented above in Table s 1 and 2.4.Conclusions In advance it could be stated that the modification of the CS with BO molecules via a "green" adsorption/desorption process lead successfully to a hydrophobic CS_BO bioac- tive blend that can be used as a masterbatch in extrusion molding processes.
The devel- oped LDPE/CS_BO active packaging films exhibited enhanced tensile, barrier, and anti- oxidant properties. In advance, the decrease of the WVTR values by increasing the CS_BO content is reported for the first time for such LDPE/CS composite films.The most prom- ising film in this work was the composite LDPE/CS_BO10.This film shows an enhanced tensile stress value without a significant decrease to the %elongation at break value, the highest water/oxygen barrier properties as they compared to the water/oxygen barri er properties of the other samples and of the pure LDPE film.Moreover, the LDPE/CS_BO10 film exhibits a melting behavior close to this of the initial pure LDPE, and a significant antioxidant activity which was higher than the relevant of the pure LDPE fil ms.
Chicken breast fillets packaged with this film and stored under vacuum at temperature 4 °C for 14 days, exhibit around 45% lower TBARS value than the corresponding value of fillets pack- aged with pure LDPE film and stored under the same conditions. This material could be a promising, active packaging film.This study is innovative, promising, and could be used as a guide for the incorporation of other essential oils in such LDPE/CS films.Author Contribution s: The synthesis experiments design, A.E.G .and C.E.S.; characterization meas- urements carrying out and interpretation, A.E.G .and C.E.S.; paper writing, A.E.G .and C.E.S .; the overall evaluation of this work, A.E.G .and C.E.S .; experimental data analysis and interpretation, (3) (3) Chicken breast fillets Figure 11.Chicken breast ﬁllets vacuum packaged with (1) “control” LDPE ﬁlm, (2) LDPE/CS_BO10 ﬁlm, and (3) package foil.3.14.Statistical Analysis All measurements were carried out at least in triplicate for each sample.
