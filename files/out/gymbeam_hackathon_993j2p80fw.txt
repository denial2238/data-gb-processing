A review of recent studies on the enrichment of eggs and poultry meat with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: novel ﬁndings and unanswered questions Robert G.Elkin ,1and Kevin J.Harvatine Department of Animal Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA ABSTRACT Studies from our laboratory over the past decade have yielded new information with regardto the dietary enrichment of eggs and poultry meat withomega-3 ( n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) but have also generated a number of unanswered ques- tions.In this review, we summarize the novel ﬁndings from this work, identify knowledge gaps, and offer possi-ble explanations for some perplexing observations.
Spe-ciﬁcally discussed are: 1) Why feeding laying hens and broilers an oil rich in stearidonic acid ( SDA ; 18:4 n-3), which theoretically bypasses the putative rate-limitingstep in the hepatic n-3 PUFA biosynthetic pathway, does not enrich egg yolks and tissues with very long-chain ( VLC ;≥20 C) n-3 PUFA to the same degree as obtained by feeding birds oils rich in preformed VLC n-3PUFA; 2) Why in hens fed an SDA-rich oil, SDA fails toaccumulate in egg yolk but is readily incorporated into adipose tissue; 3) How oils rich in oleic acid ( OA; 18:1 n- 9), when co-fed with various sources of n-3 PUFA,attenuates egg and tissue n-3 PUFA contents or rescuesegg production when co-fed with a level of docosahexae-noic acid ( DHA ; 22:6 n-3) that causes severe hypotri- glyceridemia; and 4) Why the ef ﬁciency of VLC n-3 PUFA deposition into eggs and poultry meat is inverselyrelated to the dietary content of a-linolenic acid ( ALA ; 18:3 n-3), SDA, or DHA.

Subsequent studies conducted during thepast 50 years have shown that egg yolk and/or poultrymeat are easily enriched in omega-3 ( n-3) polyunsatu- rated fatty acids ( PUFA ) by feeding hens various n-3 PUFA sources such as ﬂaxseed, ﬂaxseed oil, ﬁsh oil, ﬁsh meal, seal blubber oil, marine algae, and algal biomass(Navarro et al., 1972 ;Hulan et al., 1989 ;Hargis and Van Elswyk, 1993 ;Herber and Van Elswyk, 1996 ;Scheideler and Froning, 1996 ;Bean and Leeson, 2003 ;Cheng et al., 2004;Schreiner et al., 2004 ;Kim et al., 2016 ).
It has also been reported that markedly greater egg yolk or musclelevels of docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ; 22:6 n-3) are attained when DHA is directly supplemented as a com- ponent of ﬁsh oil or algal oil as compared to having to be biosynthesized from a-linolenic acid ( ALA ; 18:3 n-3) inthe liver and exported to extrahepatic tissues ( Leskanich and Noble, 1997 ;Gonzalez-Esquerra and Leeson, 2000 ; Rymer and Givens, 2006 ;Rymer, 2011 ,Ribeiro et al., 2013). During the past 8 years, we have published the results of 8 studies (3 broiler and 5 layer) with the overarchinggoal of enriching poultry meat and eggs with heart-healthy very long-chain ( ≥20 C; VLC ) n-3 PUFA, either using novel n-3 fatty acid-rich oils or employing dietary approaches aimed at promoting the hepatic con-version of ALA or stearidonic acid ( SDA ; 18:4 n-3) to VLC n-3 PUFA.
In this review, we summarize the novelﬁndings from these 8 studies, identify knowledge gaps, and offer possible explanations for some perplexingobservations. Speci ﬁcally discussed are: 1) Why feeding laying hens and broilers an oil rich in SDA, which theo- retically bypasses the putative rate-limiting step in the hepatic n-3 PUFA biosynthetic pathway ( Gregory et al., 2011 ;Baker et al., 2016 ), does not enrich egg yolks and tissues with VLC n-3 PUFA to the same degree asobtained by feeding birds preformed VLC n-3 PUFA; 2)W h yw h e nh e n sa r ef e da nS D A - r i c ho i l ,S D Af a i l st oa c c u -mulate in egg yolk but is readily incorporated into adiposetissue; 3) How oils rich in oleic acid ( OA; 18:1 n-9), when co-fed with various n-3 PUFA sources, attenuates egg and tissue n-3 PUFA contents or rescues egg production whenco-fed with a level of DHA that causes severe /C2112023 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.

Moreover,besides the VLC n-3 PUFA enrichment of eggs and poul-try meat, the SDA present in eggs and meat could also theoretically supply additional eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA ; 20:4 n-3) eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ; 20:5 n- 3), docosapentaenoic acid ( DPA ; 22:5 n-3), and DHA to humans via subsequent hepatic bioconversion follow-ing consumption of these products. SDA Laying Hen Studies In an initial 28-d study ( Elkin et al., 2015 ), 38-wk-old White Leghorn hens were fed a diet containing 50 g/kg high-SDA soybean oil ( SBO ), which had been engi- neered through expression of both the D6 and D15 desa- turase enzymes in the soybean plant ( Eckert et al., 2006) and compared it to diets containing 50 g/kg con- ventional SBO ( CON ), 50 g/kg ﬂaxseed oil ( FLAX ), or 50 g/kg ﬁsh oil ( FISH ).The fatty acid contents of the oils and the dietary contents of ALA, SDA, ETA, EPA, DPA, and DHA are shown in Table 1 .
In this and all subsequent laying hen studies described herein, alldata were collected on an individual bird basis and alldiets fed within a study were isonitrogenous, isocaloric, and met or exceeded the hens ’nutrient requirements as listed in the Hy-Line W-36 Commercial ManagementGuide at the time that the study was conducted. Inaddition, all laying hen and broiler study protocols wereapproved by the Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittee of The Pennsylvania State University (seeindividual articles for approved protocol numbers).There was no signi ﬁcant effect of dietary oils on hen performance and, when averaged across the 4 treatment groups, the hens gained 11 g of body weight during the28-d study, had a hen-d egg production [(100 £number of eggs laid)/number of hens £d)] rate of 90.5%, pro- duced eggs weighing 60.7 g with 15.2 g yolks, and con-sumed 96.6 g feed/hen/d ( Supplemental Table 1 ).
Although the SDA diets contained less ALA + SDA(6.3 + 8.6 g/kg, respectively; Table 1 ) than the ALA content of the FLAX diet (21.7 g/kg; Table 1 ), egg yolks from hens fed the SDA diet contained 28 mg more VLCn-3 PUFA ( P≤0.05) than yolks of eggs from hens fed the FLAX diet ( Table 2 ), suggesting that the ALA + SDA were more ef ﬁciently hepatically elongated and desaturated to VLC n-3 PUFA than was ALA alonefrom FLAX. Moreover, eggs of hens fed the SDA orFLAX diets had signi ﬁcantly greater total contents per yolk of VLC n-3 PUFA than those from the CON-fed hens (117 mg and 89 mg vs.51 mg, respectively;Table 2 ), but they contained only 39% (117 mg/302 mg) or 29% (89 mg/302 mg) of the VLC n-3 PUFA contentof yolks of eggs from hens fed the FISH diet ( Table 2 ).A similar pattern was observed in the liver fatty acids,although the differences between the VLC n-3 PUFAfrom hens fed SDA and FLAX diets were not signi ﬁcant (Table 2 ).
Feeding hens 50 g/kg of SDA-enriched soy- bean oil greatly increased the adipose (abdominal fatpads) SDA content (1443 mg/100 g tissue), whereasEPA, DPA, and DHA were only detected in adipose tis-sue from hens fed the FISH diet ( Table 2 ). Interestingly, eggs from hen fed the SDA diet only contained14 mg/yolk of SDA vs.283 mg/yolk of ALA in theFLAX-fed hens ( Table 2 ), which was remarkably low considering that the SDA content of the high-SDA soy- bean oil was approximately half that of ALA in FLAX.This was surprising since it was expected that, likeALA, SDA would be readily esteri ﬁed into hepatic tri- glycerides, packaged into very low-density lipoproteinparticles, secreted into the bloodstream, taken up bygrowing oocytes via receptor-mediated endocytosis, anddeposited into egg yolk ( Schneider, 2009 ).
Lastly, despite greater yolk VLC n-3 PUFA enrichment, there was a general lack of effect of dietary SDA on the expres-sion of a number of key genes associated with fatty aciddesaturation, fatty acid elongation, lipogenesis, choles-terol synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation, as well as lipo-genic transcription factors ( Supplemental Table 2 ), which was somewhat surprising but in agreement withtheﬁndings of a swine study ( Whelan et al., 2012 ).

Hen-d egg production,egg component percentages, and vitellogenic follicle num-bers were unaffected by dietary oil treatments. Egg yolk,liver, breast, thigh, and adipose tissue (abdominal fatpads) of AHI- and FLAX-fed hens had higher total VLC n-3 PUFA contents compared to CON hens, with the greatest increase observed at the 22.5 g/kg supplementaloil level ( Supplemental Table 3 ).Moreover, hens fed the higher amount of AHI had greater ( P<0.05) egg yolk VLC n-3 PUFA enrichment than hens fed the higher levelof FLAX (143 vs.125 mg per yolk, respectively).
Similarto that observed in the previous study with SDA-rich soy-bean oil, yolks of eggs from hens fed SDA-rich AHI con- tained very little SDA (3 and 8 mg/g yolk in the 7.5 and 22.5 g/kg supplemental AHI groups, respectively),whereas adipose contained 322 and 905 mg/100 g freshtissue, respectively ( Supplemental Table 3 ).SDA Broiler Studies In our initial SDA broiler study ( Elkin et al., 2016 ), female Ross £Heritage broilers were fed mash diets con- taining 50 g/kg of conventional soy oil ( CON ) from hatch until d 28. On d 29, they were divided into 2groups and fed diets containing either 50 g/kg CON or50 g/kg of the same SDA-enriched soybean oil that was employed in the aforementioned laying hen study until 42 d of age.Diet and oil n-3 PUFA contents are showninTable 3 .Final (42 d) body weights, as well as weight gains and feed conversion values from 29 to 35 d and 36 to 42 d,were not different ( P>0.05) between treatments ( Sup- plemental Table 4 ).
Compared to the CON treatment, dietary SDA signi ﬁcantly increased d 35 + d 42 mean total VLC n-3 PUFA contents of skinless and boneless breasts and thighs by approximately 3-fold ( Table 4 )a n d that of liver and adipose (abdominal fat pads) by approxi-mately 4- and 6-fold, respectively ( Table 5 ). Although the SDA diet also contained more total n-3 fatty acids(ALA + SDA; 19.5 mg/g diet) than the CON diet (ALAonly; 4.0 g/kg diet) ( Table 3 ), it was estimated that ALA and SDA were metabolized to VLC n-3 PUFAs and deposited into breast and thigh meat with equal ef ﬁciency (for details, see Section 3.2.3 of Elkin et al., 2016 ).The latter observation is in agreement with the ﬁndings of a subsequent broiler study conducted in our laboratorywhere equal tissue deposition ef ﬁciencies of VLC n-3 PUFA were observed in broilers fed 22.5 g/kg diet of AHIor FLAX (for details, see Table 6 of El-Zenary et al., 2022).
Docosapentaenoic acid was the predominant VLC n-3 PUFA in both muscles, which was observed in all 3 of our n-3 PUFA broiler studies ( Elkin et al, 2016 ;El-Zen- ary et al., 2020 ,2022), and suggested the existence of another control point(s) downstream of the initial hepaticD6-desaturase ( FADS2 ) reaction that was rate-limiting in the biosynthesis of DHA from ALA.

(2011) , who published their ﬁndings during the time that our ini- tial broiler study was underway, con ﬁrmed this by including a dietary ﬁsh oil treatment in their SDA- enriched soybean oil study with broilers. We also reported this in a subsequent broiler study ( El-Zen- ary et al., 2020 ) that was centered on lowering the amount of dietary linoleic acid ( LA; 18:2 n-6) to enhance the conversion of ALA to DHA but alsoincluded a dietary ﬁsh oil treatment.Lastly, since DPA was the predominant VLC n-3 PUFA inbreast, thigh, and adipose of broilers fed ALA or SDA, whereas DHA was the predominant VLC n-3 PUFA in eggs and laying hen liver, muscles, andplasma, it was concluded that laying hens are able tomore readily convert DPA to DHA.(2) In hens fed an SDA-rich oil, very little SDA accumu- lated in egg yolk as compared to adipose tissue (Table 2 and Supplemental Table 3 ).
This con- trasted greatly with how ALA, the other 18-C n-3PUFA, was distributed in eggs and adipose tissue inhens fed FLAX. (3) Dietary SDA and ALA had little effect on the expression of key genes related to fatty acid and lipidmetabolism in both laying hens and broilers ( Supple- mental Tables 2 and5).Questions Raised and Possible Explanations Question 1.If the conversion of ALA to SDA is the putative rate-limiting step of the n-3 PUFA biosyntheticpathway, then why did bypassing this step, by supple-mentation of the diets of laying hens and broilers withan SDA-rich oil, not result in the enrichment of egg yolkand tissues with VLC n-3 PUFA at levels that were com- parable to those attained by feeding hens or broilers pre- formed VLC n-3 PUFA from ﬁsh oil.Explanation 1.A simple explanation is that other rate-limiting control point(s) in the n-3 PUFA biosyn-thetic pathway exist(s) downstream of the initialhepatic D6-desaturase ( FADS2 ) reaction (ALA !SDA).

a-bWithin a row, values with no common superscript differ signi ﬁcantly (P≤0.05).4 ELKIN AND HARVATINE Zenary et al., 2022 ), raised the possibility that the sec- ondD6-desaturase ( FADS2 ) reaction (24:5 n-3 !24:6 n-3), with the latter fatty acid undergoing b-oxidation to yield DHA, is another potential downstream controlpoint of the pathway, as ﬁrst suggested by Gregory et al. (2011 ,2013).Although this might hold true when feeding birds oils rich in ALA, which would competewith tetracosapentaenoic acid ( TPA ; 24:5 n-3) as a sub- strate for FADS2 , it does not explain why DPA is the predominant VLC n-3 PUFA in breast muscle, thigh muscle, and adipose of broilers fed an SDA-rich oil(Rymer et al., 2011 ;Elkin et al., 2016 ;El-Zenary et al, 2022; and Tables 4 and5), because SDA would not com- pete with TPA as a substrate for FADS2 .
However, if the second FADS2 step is indeed a bona ﬁde rate-limit- ing reaction of the hepatic n-3 PUFA biosynthetic path-way, this at least might explain the comparatively greater conversion of SDA (vs. ALA) to VLC n-3 PUFA in eggs and tissues of laying hens and broilers.The build-up of similar amounts of intermediates (EPA and DPA) and product (DHA) in the liver ofbroilers fed an SDA-rich oil ( Elkin et al., 2016 ;El-Zenary et al., 2022 ;Table 5 ) was also indicative of a diminished n-3 PUFA biosynthetic pathway.
In contrast, and basedon DHA accounting for 94%, 82%, and 82% of liver total VLC n-3 PUFA in hens fed the CON, SDA, or FLAX diets, respectively ( Elkin et al., 2015 ;Table 2 ), and the DHA contents of egg yolk, liver, and adipose (FISH dietonly) greatly exceeding those of DPA ( Table 2 ), laying hens appear to be able to readily convert DPA to DHA.This suggests that the hepatic n-3 PUFA biosyntheticpathway of laying hens is robust but not able to generateas much DHA for egg yolk or tissue enrichment from 18- C precursors (ALA and SDA) as is attained by direct feeding of DHA from ﬁsh oil. In addition, although we provide no evidence for such, it is possible that the highcirculating estrogen levels of laying hens play a role inthis observed chicken strain difference, as broilers (bothmale and female) are sexually immature.
Extending thisthought further, could a gene(s) coding for a protein(s)involved in the conversion of DPA to DHA contain an estrogen responsive element in the 5 0upstream region, similar to genes coding for vitellogenin I, II, and III, aswell as several apolipoproteins that are components ofvery low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL ), that are hepati- cally synthesized following induction by estrogen ( Her- mann et al., 1997 )? Lastly, as suggested by Rymer and Givens (2005) , the inef ﬁcient conversion of SDA and ALA to DHA could also possibly be attributed to a por- tion of their hepatic pools undergoing b-oxidation.Question 2.Does the laying hen liver process SDA differently than ALA in terms of incorporation into tri-glycerides, packaging into VLDL particles, secretioninto the bloodstream, or transport to the ovary vs.otherextrahepatic tissues?Explanation 2.
The paucity of SDA in egg yolks of hens fed an SDA-rich oil ( Elkin et al., 2015 ;El-Zenary et al., 2023 ;Table 2 ; and Supplemental Table 3 ) was another perplexing observation, since it was expectedthat, like ALA, SDA would be readily esteri ﬁed intoliver triglycerides, packaged into VLDL particles, secreted into the bloodstream, taken up by growing oocytes via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and depos-ited into egg yolk ( Schneider, 2009 ). One possible expla- nation is that, within the liver, SDA distributes intovarious intracellular lipid pools and is metabolized dif-ferently than other 18-C PUFA, as has been reported inrat hepatocytes for g-linoleic acid (18:3 n-6) ( Voss and Sprecher, 1988 ).
It is also possible that SDA is secreted by the liver into the bloodstream as an albumin-bound nonesteri ﬁed fatty acid or is preferentially incorporated into VLDL particles containing a novel estrogen-regu-lated apolipoprotein-VLDL-IV ( Apo-IV ), which are excluded from oocyte uptake but deliver their lipids tosomatic cells ( Nikolay et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, a greater portion of the SDA pool in the liver could puta-tively undergo b-oxidation to a greater degree than does the ALA pool.Lastly, it is also interesting to note that while SDA is synthesized in hepatocytes, it is found invery few plants; thus endogenous (synthesized) SDAand exogenous (dietary origin) SDA could possibly bemetabolized differently.Question 3 .Is the hepatic n-3 PUFA biosynthetic pathway limited in its desaturation and elongationcapacity, substrate driven to a degree, and therefore refractory to changes in the expression of key genes if and when they occur?
Explanation 3 .As described above, it is suggested that the laying hen liver is able to readily bioconvertALA or SDA to DHA, but at a rate that is not robustenough to result in the enrichment of egg yolks and tis-sues with as much VLC n-3 PUFA as is attained bydirect supplementation of EPA and DHA. In contrast, the build-up of VLC n-3 PUFA intermediates in the liver, and the predominance of DPA over DHA in thebreast and thigh muscles of broilers fed ALA or SDA isreﬂective of a diminished n-3 PUFA biosynthetic path- way.Alternately, several researchers ( Lop/C19ez-Ferrer et al., 2001 ;Rymer and Givens, 2005 ;Baeza et al., 2013) have suggested that in meat-type chickens, most of the endogenously biosynthesized DHA remains sequestered in the liver and is not transported to or deposited in skeletal muscles.
Therefore, the hepatic n-3 PUFA biosynthetic pathway of laying hens appearsto be limited in its desaturation and elongation capac-ity in terms of the absolute amount of DHA that it cangenerate, whereas the broiler hepatic n-3 PUFA biosyn-thetic pathway is less than robust in its ability to pro-duce DHA from 18-C n-3 precursors. Lastly, in both laying hens and broilers, it is possible that exogenous fatty acids, rather than those endogenously biosynthe-sized, are selectively used as substrates for diacylgly-cerol acyltransferase 1, the main acyltransferaseresponsible for the re-esteri ﬁcation of diacylglycerol to triacylglycerol that is destined for hepatic secretionwithin VLDL particles (Mashek, 2013) .
The general lack of effect of dietary SDA and ALA on the expression of key lipid metabolism genes related to the n-3 PUFA biosynthetic pathway also suggested thatin both chickens ( Elkin et al., 2015 ,2016,2018) and ratsEGG AND MEAT OMEGA-3 FATTY ACID ENRICHMENT 5 (Tu et al., 2010 ), VLC n-3 PUFA synthesis may be regu- lated more by substrate levels than by gene expression and simply cannot ramp up enough to provide as muchVLC n-3 PUFA to egg yolk and extrahepatic tissues asis attained by directly feeding VLC n-3 PUFA to layinghens and broilers. Burge (2022) opined that in humans, the limited synthesis of EPA and DHA from ALA could be theresult of evolutionary pressures that ensured the pro- duction of adequate amounts of VLC n-3 PUFA to meet the body ’s normal physiological needs and avoid deﬁciency symptoms.
While dietary and supra-dietary E P Ap l u sD H Ai n t a k e sc o n f e rh e a l t hb e n e ﬁts,Burge (2022) argued that no adverse e ffects on health or cog- nitive development have been reported in humanswhose diets exclude EPA and DHA, indicating thattheir synthesis from ALA appears to be nutritionally adequate. This could also be the case in chickens, which also have a limited ability to hepatically convertALA or SDA to VLC n-3 PUFA but typically do notexhibit symptoms of essential fatty acid de ﬁciency.Thus, the goal of enriching eggs and meat with VLCn-3 PUFA at levels much greater than that which canbe attained by feeding chickens ALA- or SDA-enricheddiets may be pharmacological rather than physiologi- cal in nature.
OLEIC ACID, WHEN CO-FED WITH VARIOUS n-3 PUFA, ATTENUATES EGG AND TISSUE n-3 PUFA CONTENTS OR RESCUES EGG PRODUCTION WHEN CO-FED WITH A LEVEL OF DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID THAT CAUSES SEVERE HYPOTRIGLYCERIDEMIA Dietary Oleic Acid-Associated Attenuation ofEgg and Tissue n-3 PUFA Contents As diets rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA ), such as OA, have been shown to be cardio- protective in humans ( Hammad et al., 2016 ;Morris and Bhatnagar, 2016 ;Whelan et al., 2016 ), the goal of our initial OA study ( Elkin et al., 2018 ) was to produce a more heart-healthy egg, enriched in both OA and VLCn-3 PUFA. Nine 51-wk-old White Leghorn laying henswere each fed a reduced-LA base diet containing 10, 20,30, or 40 g/kg of high-OA soybean oil ( HOSO ) for 84 d.The HOSO was solvent-extracted from Plenish soybeans(DuPont-Pioneer).Within each group, supplementaldietary FLAX was increased every 21 d from 0 to 10 to 20 to 40 g/kg diet.
Since LA competes with ALA for hepatic desaturase and elongase enzymes ( Fraeye et al., 2012;Kartikasari et al., 2012 ;Goldberg et al., 2013 ;Jing et al., 2013 ), we hypothesized that the reduced dietary level of LA would promote greater hepatic conversion ofALA to VLC n-3 PUFA in hens fed the FLAX-supple-mented diets. Oil and diet contents of OA and ALA, theonly n-3 PUFA present, are shown in Table 6 .There was no signi ﬁcant dietary HOSO £FLAX interactions for hen-d egg production, egg weight, yolkweight, or feed intake, which averaged 86.2%, 61.8 g, 16.4 g, and 99.0 g/hen/d, respectively, over the 84-dstudy.Feeding hens increasing amounts of FLAX resulted in elevated yolk contents of ALA, VLC n-3 PUFA, and total n-3 PUFA ( Table 7 ).
Surprisingly, within each of the 3 supplemental FLAX levels (10, 20,and 40 g FLAX/kg diet), yolk contents of ALA, VLC n-3 PUFA, and total n-3 PUFA varied inversely ( P< 0.05) with the dietary level of HOSO and were maxi-mally reduced by 37%, 15%, and 32%, respectively, ineggs from hens fed 40 g/kg HOSO vs. 0 g/kg HOSO within the 40 g/kg FLAX treatment.Conversely, die- tary FLAX did not signi ﬁcantly affect yolk OA contents (Table 7 ).There was no effect ( P>0.05) of dietary FLAX or HOSO on the absolute or relative 84-d weightsof the abdominal fat pad (adipose) or liver.Increasingthe dietary HOSO content generally resulted inincreased liver OA contents (although for someunknown reason this was not the case for hens fed 20 g HOSO/kg diet) and signi ﬁcantly ( P<0.05) attenuated hepatic contents of EPA and DPA, but did not affectDHA, total VLC n-3 PUFA, or total n-3 PUFA levels(Table 8 ).
No VLC n-3 PUFA were detected in adipose tissue, whereas increased supplemental levels of dietaryHOSO signi ﬁcantly ( P<0.05) elevated adipose OA con- tent but was without effect on ALA, SDA, or total n-3PUFA contents ( Table 9 ). The absence of VLC n-3 PUFA in adipose and their presence in liver was a re ﬂec- tion of the relative differences in the contribution ofmembrane phospholipid and neutral lipids to the totalfatty acid content of the tissues ( Cook, 1996 ).AlthoughTable 6.

A subsequent study from our laboratory ( Elkin et al., 2021), con ﬁrmed that when 53-wk-old laying hens were fed diets co-supplemented with oils enriched in ALA andOA, the deposition of n-3 PUFA in egg yolk was attenu-ated as compared to feeding hens a diet supplementedwith the ALA-rich oil alone.In addition, those ﬁndingswere extended to include another n-3 PUFA-enriched oil (SDA-enriched soybean oil) and 2 other high-OA oils, suggesting that yolk n-3 PUFA attenuation was notplant-oil speci ﬁc.
Unexpectedly, it was observed that feeding 38-wk-old laying hens a supplemental LA-richoil plus an oil rich in either SDA or ALA also attenuatedegg yolk ALA and SDA contents (Experiment 1), or eggyolk and liver ALA contents (Experiment 2), as com-pared to feeding the SDA- or ALA-rich oils alone. Rescue of Egg Production in Hypotriglyceridemic Hens by Dietary OleicAcid Besides ﬁsh oil and ﬁsh meal, algal biomass and micro- algae oils ( MAO ) are 2 other commercially available ingredients containing preformed EPA and DHA thathave been fed to poultry to enrich eggs and meat withVLC n-3 PUFA.
In a recent laying hen study from ourlaboratory ( Elkin et al., 2023 ), the following diets were fed to 49-wk-old White Leghorn hens for 28 d: 1) A de- germinated corn-ground yellow corn −soybean meal- based diet with no supplemental oil (control diet;CON ); 2) CON + 10 g/kg DHA-rich MAO (DHA Natur oil, re ﬁned and bleached, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Clinton, IA); 3) CON + 20 g/kg MAO;4) CON + 30 g/kg MAO; 5) CON + 40 g/kg MAO;6) CON + 40 g/kg MAO + 20 g/kg HOSO; and 7) CON + 40 g/kg MAO + 40 g/kg HOSO ( Table 10 ).
The goals of the study were 3-fold: 1) To evaluate the effectof feeding laying hens graded levels of a DHA-rich MAOon the enrichment of eggs and tissues with VLC n-3PUFA; 2) To observe the effect of the dietary DHA-richMAO on hen performance and the expression of keygenes related to VLDL and triglyceride synthesis andsecretion; and 3) As a follow-up to our studies where co- feeding hens an OA-rich oil and an ALA-rich oil resulted in the attenuation of egg yolk n-3 PUFA contents com-pared to feeding the hens a diet supplemented with theALA-rich oil alone ( Elkin et al., 2018 ,2021), 2 diets con- taining both high-OA sun ﬂower oil ( HOSO ) and high- DHA MAO were included in the study.

They also were the only treatment group that had a negative body weight gain during the28-d study and had the poorest feed conversion ef ﬁ- ciency (g feed/g egg mass) ( Supplemental Table 6 ). Co- feeding 40 g MAO/kg diet with either 20 or 40 g HOSO/ kg diet completely rescued egg production, as well asfeed consumption, egg weights, and yolk weights, andsigniﬁcantly elevated circulating triglycerides ( Table 11 ).Conversely, absolute and relative liver weights were sig-niﬁcantly increased in hens fed 40 g MAO/kg diet, which was restored to CON levels with HOSO co-supplementa-tion ( Table 11 ).Markedly lower weights ( Table 11 ) and numbers of vitellogenic (growing, yolk-accumulating) follicles were observed in hens fed 40 mg MAO/kg diet,with 5 of the 8 hens out of production and 3 with completely regressed ovaries by d 28.Co-feeding hens with either level of HOSO completely restored the ovar-ian follicular hierarchy and rate of ovulation.
Dietarysupplementation of MAO greatly enriched egg yolk withDHA and VLC n-3 PUFA, which plateaued, in terms ofstatistical signi ﬁcance, at the 30 g MAO/kg diet level (Diet 4; Table 12 ). In addition, there was a linear increase in egg yolk DHA and VLC n-3 PUFA content over the ﬁrst 2 supplemental levels of MAO, with an additional »100 mg of yolk DHA or VLC n-3 PUFA being deposited for each additional 10 g MAO/kg dietconsumed ( Table 12 ).DHA accounted for between 88% and 95% of total egg yolk n-3 PUFA in the 6 MAO-sup-plemented diets ( Table 12 ).As in the aforementioned studies with ALA and SDA, the ef ﬁciency of conversion (g/g) of dietary DHA to egg yolk DHA decreased with increasing dietary DHA intake.This will be discussed further in the last section of this review.
The hepatic mRNA abundance of apolipoprotein B (apoB ), apolipoprotein VLDL-II ( apoVLDL-II ), microsomal triglyceride transport protein ( MTTP ), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 ( DGAT2 ), which are all important genes with regard to the synthesis oftriglycerides or VLDL, all followed a similar pattern in that the highest levels were observed in hens fed Diets 1 to 3 (0 to 20 mg MAO/kg diet), followed by a largedecrease in hens fed Diets 4 and 5 (30 and 40 mg MAO/kg diet, respectively), and then a large increase in the 2HOSO co-supplemented treatment groups (Diets 6 and7;Supplemental Figure 2 ).

Similar to the “OA effect, ”co-feeding an LA-rich oil with an ALA-rich oil also resulted inthe attenuation of yolk n-3 PUFA deposition com-pared to feeding hens a diet supplemented with theALA-rich oil alone.(2) In hens fed DHA-rich MAO, egg yolk VLC n-3 PUFA enrichment plateaued, in terms of statisticalsigniﬁcance, at the 30 g/kg MAO level (266 mg/ yolk).Moreover, the yolk DHA and VLC n-3 PUFA contents achieved by MAO supplementation of thehens ’diet are, to the authors ’knowledge, among the highest ever reported.
(3) As compared to the CON group, hens fed the highest level of MAO (40 g/kg diet) exhibited greatly atten-uated measures of productive performance, with 5 ofthe 8 hens ceasing egg production entirely by d 27 or earlier, and had extremely enlarged livers, markedly lowered circulating triglyceride levels, and depressedexpression of key hepatic genes involved in VLDLsynthesis and secretion. Again, to the authors ’ knowledge, the complete cessation of egg productionin hens fed high dietary levels of DHA (from MAO)had not been previously reported.
(4) As compared to hens fed 40 g MAO/kg diet, feeding hens the 40 g MAO/kg diet co-supplemented with either 20 g/kg or 40 g/kg of an OLA-rich HOSOrestored egg production and all other measures ofhen productive performance, as well as the ovarianfollicle hierarchy and follicle weights, elevatedplasma triglyceride levels, prevented liver enlarge-ment, and increased the hepatic expression of keygenes involved in triglyceride and VLDL synthesis and secretion. Questions Raised and Possible Explanations Question 1.How does co-feeding hens an oil rich in ALA with an oil rich in OA attenuate egg yolk n-3PUFA contents as compared to feeding hens a diet sup-plemented with the ALA-rich oil alone?Explanation 1.
Based on the positional distribution of fatty acids on dietary triacylglycerols and the knownrelationships to digestive (e.g., micelle formation) andabsorptive processes, we previously hypothesized thatdietary OA may simply have “outcompeted ”ALA for uptake from the intestine ( Elkin et al., 2018 ). In addi- tion, it is possible that competition existed between OAand ALA (or SDA in other studies) for esteri ﬁcation within intestinal and/or liver cells or that OA promoted theb-oxidation of ALA (or SDA).Question 2 .How does feeding hens a large amount of n-3 PUFA, such as DHA from MAO, markedly lowerplasma triglycerides, which in turn attenuates egg pro-duction and yolk weights?Explanation 2.Although not completely understood and based on mammalian studies, it has been proposed that n-3 PUFA inhibit hepatic DGAT2, increase plasma lipoprotein lipase activity and apoB degradation,Table 11.

a-cWithin a column, values with no common superscript differ signi ﬁcantly ( P≤0.05).EGG AND MEAT OMEGA-3 FATTY ACID ENRICHMENT 9 decrease hepatic lipogenesis through downregulating SREBP1 transcription factor, and increase hepatic fatty acidb-oxidation, resulting in lower circulating triglycer- ide levels ( Backes et al., 2016 ;Mason, 2019 ;Wolska et al., 2020 ). Moreover, several observations in the MAO study might help to elucidate mechanistically how markedly lowering circulating triglyceride levels wouldin turn result in the attenuation of egg production, eggweights, and yolk weights.First, hens fed the 40 gMAO/kg diet had circulating triglyceride levels thatwere only 22% of CON bird values (663 mg/100 mL vs.2,960 mg/100 mL; Table 11 ), which suggested a marked impairment of hepatic VLDL secretion, since chicken plasma VLDL particles contain approximately 65% to 69% triglycerides ( Kouba et al., 1995 ;Sato et al., 2009 ).
Second, the relative hepatic mRNA levels of both apoBand apoVLDL-II, the 2 key apolipoproteins of VLDLparticles ( Hermann et al., 1997 ), were also only 26% and 22% of the levels in CON birds ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) which paralleled the degree of reduction in circulatingtriglycerides. Somewhat similar patterns of hepatic expression were observed for MTTP, which is another key gene involved in assembly of VLDL ( Shelness and Ledford, 2005 ;Eresheim et al., 2014 ) and DGAT2, which catalyzes the de novo synthesis of triglycerides(Zammit, 2013 ), both of which were depressed in hens fed 40 g MAO/kg (43% and 54% of CON values, respec-tively ( Supplemental Figure 2 ).Since hepatically syn- thesized VLDL constitutes approximately 60% of egg yolk ( Burley et al., 1993 ), it would follow that a marked impairment of hepatic VLDL synthesis and secretionwould have severe negative effects on yolk precursor for-mation, yolk weights, and egg production.
Moreover,the greatly increased liver weights observed in hens fed40 g MAO/kg diet ( Table 11 ) may have resulted from hepatic steatosis, analogous to what occurs in overfedducks and geese employed in foie gras production (Hermier, 1997 ). Question 3 .How does co-supplementing a high- DHA diet (40 g MAO/kg) with an OA-rich oilcompletely rescue egg production and other measures of hen productive performance?Explanation 3 .This also putatively involves the positional distribution of fatty acids on dietary triacyl-glycerols and known relationships to digestive and absorptive processes.If OA also simply “outcompeted ” DHA for uptake from the intestine, then an analogousresult (i.e., lower DHA transfer to the egg) was antici-pated in hens fed the 2 co-supplemented HOSO diets vs.the 40 g MAO/kg diet ( Table 10 ).
Unexpectedly, when HOSO was co-fed with the 40 g MAO/kg diet, egg yolkDHA and VLC n-3 PUFA contents were not affected oronly slightly reduced at the lower and higher HOSO lev- els, respectively ( Table 12 ), but egg production and associated performance metrics were completely rescuedand a normal liver size (weight) and ovarian follicle hier-archy was restored. Thus, it is possible that co-supple-mentation of the 40 g MAO/kg diet with HOSOcompetitively prevented the intestinal absorption ofsome of the dietary DHA to the extent that the amount which was absorbed and reached the liver was below the threshold level that impaired hepatic triglyceride and VLDL synthesis and secretion, thereby allowing normalhepatic yolk precursor production without impairingegg production or attenuating yolk weights.THE EFFICIENCY OF VLC n-3 PUFA DEPOSITION INTO EGGS AND POULTRY MEAT IS INVERSELY RELATED TO THE DIETARY CONTENT OF ALA, SDA, OR DHA In the laying hen study by Elkin et al.
(2018) , the con- version ef ﬁciency of dietary ALA to egg yolk VLC n-3 PUFA was highest (approximately 52%) in hens fed nosupplemental HOSO or FLAX (dietary ALA intake wasapproximately 79 mg/hen/d; Supplemental Figure 3 ) and subsequently decreased with increasing FLAX intake ( Table 13 ). Conversion ef ﬁciency was calculated as [100 £(average mg VLC n-3 PUFA perTable 12.

Others have reported reduced conversion ef ﬁciencies of dietary ALA to egg yolk VLC n-3 PUFA in laying hens fed varyingamounts of ground ﬂaxseed ( Caston and Leeson, 1990 ; Cherian and Sim, 1991 ) or ground or whole ﬂaxseed (Aymond and Van Elsywk, 1995 ). More recently, we ( El-Zenary et al., 2023 ) also reported a higher ef ﬁciency of VLC n-3 PUFAenrichment of egg yolks, as a percentage of n-3 PUFA intake, in CON hens (26.5%) vs.hens fed supplementalAHI or FLAX (21.7%, 18.6%, 20.2%, and 14.2% in hensfed 7.5 g/kg supplemental AHI, 22.5 g/kg supplementalAHI, 7.5 g/kg supplemental FLAX, and 22.5 g/kg sup-plemental FLAX, respectively; Supplemental Table 7 ).
Overall, both supplemental dietary SDA-rich AHI and ALA-rich FLAX oils increased VLC n-3 PUFA deposi-tion into egg yolks and hens ’tissues but, as previously observed in our laying hen study ( Elkin et al., 2015 ), an SDA-rich oil (AHI) promoted greater egg and tissueenrichment than similar amounts of ALA-rich FLAX.Lastly, maximal VLC n-3 PUFA enrichment of eggs(»125 mg per yolk) occurred at daily intake of approxi- mately 1,000 mg n-3 PUFA while, on an absolute basis, further increases in dietary n-3 PUFA intake resulted inonly minimal increases.Table 13.

Lastly, the conversion ef ﬁciency (%) of dietary DHA to egg yolk VLC n-3 PUFA decreased with increasingDHA intake as follows for hens fed 10, 20, 30, or 40 gMAO/kg: 25%, 23%, 15%, and 11%, respectively ( Elkin et al., 2023 ;Table 13 ). Because almost all of the egg VLC n-3 PUFA was present as DHA ( Table 12 ), the cal- culated ef ﬁciency of transfer of dietary DHA to egg yolk DHA for hens fed 10, 20, 30, or 40 g MAO/kg diet was virtually the same (24%, 21%, 14%, and 10%, respec-tively.Novel Finding From the Conversion Efﬁciency Studies In 3 of the above mentioned studies, it was demon- strated that the ef ﬁciency of the dietary conversion of ALA ( Elkin et al., 2018 ), SDA ( El Zenary et al., 2022 ), and DHA ( Elkin et al., 2023 ) into egg yolk, broiler tis- sues, or egg yolk VLC n-3 PUFA, respectively, variedinversely (but not directly) with the dietary amount ofeach n-3 PUFA.
Conversion ef ﬁciencies for SDA from a high-SDA soybean oil or AHI, and for DHA from aMAO, have not been previously reported. Questions Raised and Possible Explanations Question 1.Why is the hepatic n-3 PUFA biosyn- thetic pathway only able to convert limited amounts ofALA or SDA to VLC n-3 PUFA and becomes less ef ﬁ- cient when dietary amounts of these fatty acids areincreased?Explanation 1.The reduced conversion/transfer efﬁciency of dietary ALA to yolk VLC n-3 PUFA with increasing levels of dietary FLAX con ﬁrmed previous reports ( Caston and Leeson, 1990 ;Cherian and Sim, 1991;Aymond and Van Elswyk, 1995 ;Nain et al., 2012 ) in laying hens fed varying amounts of ground or wholeﬂaxseeds or an extruded ﬂax product.The lower conver- sion of ALA to VLC n-3 PUFA with increased dietary ALA levels has been hypothesized to be related to a sat- uration of activity of hepatic desaturase enzymesinvolved in ALA metabolism ( Cachaldora et al., 2008 ).
The same could hold true for the conversion of dietarySDA to VLC n-3 PUFA in both laying hens and broilers.Since it is well documented that EPA and DHA enrich-ment of eggs ( Leskanich and Noble, 1997 ;Cachaldora et al., 2008 ;Fraeye et al., 2012 ;Elkin et al., 2015 ;Neijat et al., 2017 ) and poultry meat ( Leskanich and Noble, 1997;Gonzalez-Esquerra and Leeson, 2000 ;Rymer andGivens, 2006 ;Rymer et al., 2010 ,2011) is more readily achieved by direct feeding of these VLC n-3 PUFA vs. ALA, it is likely that the capacity of laying hens andbroilers to hepatically biosynthesize VLC n-3 PUFA isboth inef ﬁcient and, in absolute terms, quite limited.Tu et al.(2010) have suggested that VLC n-3 PUFA syn- thesis in rats is regulated more by substrate levels thanby gene expression, and although the same may holdtrue for chickens, the pathway is most likely quickly overwhelmed by too much substate.Question 2 .Is the liver limited in its ability to incor- porate dietary DHA into VLDL particles?
Explanation 2 .As the case of many fat-soluble com- pounds, such as lutein (Leeson and Caston, 2004) , egg yolk content can be increased, but the ef ﬁciency of trans- fer declines with higher levels of dietary supplementa-tion. We have shown that the same holds true for dietary DHA ( Elkin et al., 2023 ), which plateaued (in terms of statistical signi ﬁcance) in egg yolks at a dietary level of 30 g MAO/kg diet.Therefore, it is hypothesizedthat there are ﬁnite limits to which absorbed dietary DHA can ﬁrst be incorporated into liver triglycerides and, subsequently, into hepatic VLDL particles that aresecreted by the liver into the bloodstream, taken up bygrowing oocytes via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and deposited into egg yolk ( Schneider, 2009 ).CONCLUSION In scienti ﬁc discovery, the testing of hypotheses can simultaneously yield speci ﬁc answers to the problems at hand while raising new and sometimes unanticipatedquestions.
Studies on the dietary enrichment of eggs andpoultry meat with VLC n-3 PUFA is a case in point.The purpose of this review was to alert the Poultry Sci- ence community to both new ﬁndings and unanswered questions on this topic, which is of importance to the poultry industry with implications for human health.
