DOI:10.1002/adhm.2021010191.Introduction The early detection of a disease plays a crucial role when it comes to its prog- nosis/diagnosis, especially in the case of oncological patients.
Accordingly, there is an urgent need for more eﬃcient tools for detailed and more accurate non-invasive tissue and lesion imaging. Among the several non-invasive imaging modalities currently used in clinic (magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) imaging), MRI is one of the most used in clinical settings.
This stems from the fact that it has great spatial resolution, being the most conve- nient technique to visualize pathological details at tissue depth, and despite its low sensitivity drawback.[1]Nevertheless, the use of contrast agents in MRI signiﬁcantly improves the sensitivity, such that more precise information of the disease region can be obtained as acquiring images with muchhigherquality.[2] M.A.Ramos-Docampo,V.Salgueiriño DepartamentodeFísicaAplicada UniversidadedeVigo Vigo36310,Spain E-mail:vsalgue@uvigo.es M.A.Ramos-Docampo,V.Salgueiriño CINBIO UniversidadedeVigo Vigo36310,Spain A.daSilva-Candal,P.Hervella,R.Iglesias-Rey ClinicalNeurosciencesResearchLaboratory HealthResearchInstituteofSantiagodeCompostela(IDIS) SERGAS SantiagodeCompostela15706,Spain A.B.Dávila-Ibáñez,R.López-López Roche-CHUSJoint-Unit TranslationalMedicalOncologyGroup HealthResearchInstituteofSantiagodeCompostela(IDIS) SERGAS SantiagodeCompostela15706,Spain Adv.

AdvancedHealthcareMaterialspublishedbyWiley-VCHGmbH www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de Currently,thecontrastagentsusedinclinicsforMRIaresmall molecules, mostly based on Gd-based complexes.[3]However, since this kind of molecules normally presents fast metabolism and non-speciﬁc biodistribution through the body, they can also imply systemic toxic side eﬀects.Alternatively, nanomate- rials can be used to overcome the limitations of conventional contrast agents due to their unique properties of passive and activetargeting,largepayloadability,controlledengineeringand the possibility to be combined with therapy for nanotheranos- tics applications.[4]Considering these potential advantages of nanomaterials with respect to conventional contrast agents, the investigation in nano-imaging agents has promptly increased in recent years.
Moreover, besides the common function of anatomical MRI, contrast agents based on nanomaterials can also be exploited for functional MRI applications, such as the real-time monitorization of the tumor temperature induced by photothermaltherapyandthedetectionofspeciﬁcmoleculecon- centrations present in the tumor microenvironment.[5,6]Taking thisintoconsideration,promisinginvitroandpreclinicalresults havebeendemonstrated,endingupwithmagneticnanoparticles forexample,alreadyincludedinclinicalprograms.[7] Whenitcomestomagneticnanoparticles,theirmagneticmo- ment is capable of inducing ﬁeld inhomogeneities in the sur- rounding environment (typically composed by water molecules when the nanoparticles are immersed in tissue) when a ra- diofrequencypulseisapplied.Therefore,magneticnanoparticles show themselves as ideal candidates for enhanced MRI, owing to this strong interaction between their magnetic moment and the proton’s magnetic moments in water molecules, which al- terstheirrelaxationandcausesadiﬀerentcontrastresolutionbe- tween diﬀerent neighboring tissues.
In this context, superpara- magneticnanoparticlesofbiocompatiblespinelferrites,suchas manganeseferritenanoparticles,withcharacteristichighvalues of saturation magnetization, become therefore appropriate for MRIapplications,takingintoaccounttheirT2-weightedcontrast signal.[8–10] Thisoutstandingpotentialshownbythemagneticnanoparti- cles can however become compromised, if taking into account theireasinesstoaggregateindiﬀerentbio-relatedmediaortheir in vivo toxicity, demonstrated to produce cell oxidative stress that can lead to cell death.[11,12]While several surface coatings withdiﬀerentbiocompatiblecompoundshavebeendescribedto overcome these issues,[13–16]the encapsulation of the magnetic nanoparticles into organic nanoplatforms (e.g., liposomes, mi- celles, polymeric nanoparticles or nanoemulsions) can oﬀer ad- ditional advantages.
For example, besides enhancing their bio- compatibility, their encapsulation can control the nanoparticles bloodcirculationtime,easethedevelopmentofnanotheranostics strategiesandevenincreasethesensitivityofMRIcomparedwith free metal nanoparticles by enhancing the contrast signal.[17–19] Lipid nanoemulsions can oﬀer several advantages compared to otherorganicnanoplatforms.Moreindetail,thesesystemsshow higherloadingcapacityoflipophilicdrugsand/orcontrastagents due to their oily core and excellent colloidal stability due to the polar functional groups at their outer surface.
These character- istics render them promising platforms for drug delivery, non- invasive imaging and nanotheranostic applications.[20]Further- more,theselipidnanoemulsionscanbetailoredaswellintermsof biocompatibility, taking into account biodegradable non-toxic materialsfortheirpreparation.[21,22] Our group has recently reported the preparation and charac- terizationofabioinspiredformulationbasedonlipidnanoemul- sions using an one-step, extremely simple and cost-eﬀective method.[23]The main component is Vitamin E (VitE), which is a natural antioxidant and forms the oil droplets that are stabilized by sphingomyelin (SM), one of the main lipids of cell membranes.
Previous results by our group highlight their high biocompatibilityandversatilityinnanomedicine,duetotheirca- pacitytocarryhydrophobicdrugs,biomoleculesforgenetherapy and radiometals for diagnosis applications.[24,25]Additional ad- vantagesofthesenanosystemsrefertotheirsimplicity,greatcol- loidalstability,andeﬃcientinternalizationbythetargetedcells. With the above into account, we have reformulated our strat- egy, focusing in this study on the use of VitE/SM nanoemul- sions (NEs) as lipid nanocarriers of manganese ferrite nanopar- ticles (MFO) with the aim of notably enhancing the sensitivity oftheMRItechnique.Here,wedescribethesynthesisandchar- acterization of manganese ferrite nanoparticles coated and sta- bilized with VitE (VitE-MFO) and their subsequent encapsula- tioninNEstoaﬀordmagneticnanoemulsions(VitE-MFO-NEs).

These bands also appear slightly shifted, likely becauseofthenanometricsizeofthecrystals.Thesemagneticnanoparticlesareinitiallystabilizedbyanor- ganic layer of oleic acid (OA) molecules attached to their sur- face, which keeps them stable in chloroform.In order to pave the way to encapsulate these MFO nanoparticles into the NEs, these OA molecules attached on the surface of the nanoparti- cles are ﬁrst displaced/replaced by vitamin E (VitE), following theligandexchangeprotocoldetailedintheexperimentalsection.Figure 1d includes FTIR spectra of the sample before and after promoting this ligand exchange at the surface of the nanopar- ticles.
The black spectrum corresponds to the oleic acid coated nanoparticles, where the typical vibrational bands of oleic acid can be visualized, with the bands centered at 3496 cm−1stem- mingfromtheO–Hvibrationalmodes,andthebandslocatedat 1113and1580cm−1fromtheC –OandC ═Obondsrespectively; allofthemrelatedtothecarboxylicgroupoftheoleicacid.Inad- dition to those, the bands ranging from 2852 to 2962 cm−1and the one centered at 1444 cm−1correspond to the C–H stretch- ing,ortheC–Hbendingmodes,respectively,ofthehydrocarbon chainofthemolecule.Alternatively,theredspectrumoﬀersthe vibrationalmodesaftertheligandexchange.Thedisappearingof the stretching modes at 3496 and 1580 cm−1, associated to the carboxylic groups of the oleic acid just conﬁrms the ligand ex- change.
Though bands centered at 1458 cm−1and in the regionranging from 2854 to 2968 cm−1are still present, they can be associated in this case to the C–H vibrational modes present in thevitaminmolecule.Thebandat1115cm−1,whichstemsfrom theetherbond,canaswellbeassociatedtothevitamin,present in its molecule.

The selection of VitE for MFO coating was reinforced by the well-known antioxidant activity of VitE which might help im- prove the biocompatibility of the magnetic nanoparticles by re- ducingtheiroxidantabilities,inhibitingorreducingtheproduc- tion of reactive oxygen (ROS) in vivo and thus, overcoming one ofthemainlimitationsforthetranslationofthesenanoparticles to clinic.[28]In addition, this previous coating of the nanoparti- cleswithVitErenderseasiertheencapsulationintheVitaminE- basednanoemulsions(videinfra).
In order to include the vitamin E-coated MFO nanoparticles intotheNEs,theorganicphasecomposedbyoilandsurfactants (with or without VitE-MFO) was injected in ultrapure water as shown in the scheme included in Figure S1 (Supporting Infor- mation).AhomogeneoussuspensionofNEsandVitE-MFO-NEs (PDI=0.19 in both cases) with an average size of 141 ±3n m or 149±5 nm was spontaneously obtained after the injection, respectively,asshownbytheDLSanalysis( Figure2a).Figure2b shows the 𝜁-potential values of both NEs and VitE-MFO-NEs Adv.

These results are consistent with the DLS analysis, but NTA oﬀers better resolution than DLS allowing the observation of peaks very closed in size that cannot be detected by DLS.[33]The results obtained from DLS and NTA show that the encapsulation of VitE-MFO into the nanoemulsions did not produce signiﬁcant variations in their physicochemical properties, giving similar size, zeta potential andconcentrationofbothformulations.Thus,wehavedescribed the preparation of magnetic emulsions by an extremely simpleand fast method. In fact, both formulations can be prepared in less than 10 min and in a very reproducible way as shown in Figure 2d.Furthermore, once prepared, colloidal stability studies of the VitE-MFO-NEs were assessed in three diﬀerent relevant media (i.e., DMEM culture medium, phosphate buﬀer pH 7.4 and saline solution of NaCl 0.9%) by measuring the average size over time.
The very slight variation in average size (within the error bar) (Figure 2e) in the three cases indicates thenanoemulsionskeeptheinitialmorphologyoverthisperiod of 24 h at 37 °C in diﬀerent media (and therefore exposed to diﬀerentionicstrengthordiﬀerentbiologicallyrelevantcontent), demonstrating therefore their high stability, which is key for furtherinvitroandinvivostudies.[34] Moreover,themagneticnanoparticlesencapsulationeﬃciency wasdeterminedbyICP-OESafterisolationandquantiﬁcationof Adv.

Generally, the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials have been demonstrated to play a key role in the in vivo behavior of the formulation.[35]For example, the mean size of nanomaterials is a key point in cancer applications as it strongly inﬂuences tumor accumulation and penetration; it is widely assumed that small nanoparticles can extravasate in the leaky vasculature of tumors due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) eﬀect,36and that negative surface charge nanoparticleshavelongerbloodcirculationtimesandcanreach thetargetorgansmoreeﬃcientlythanpositiveones.[37] StructuralcharacterizationofNEsandVitE-MFO-NEswasper- formed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE- SEM),TransmissionElectronMicroscopy(TEM),AtomicForces Microscopy(AFM)andMagneticForcesMicroscopy(MFM),with representativeimagesincludedin Figure3.ImagesofplainNEswereacquiredbyTEM(Figure3a)andFESEM,usingtwodetec- tor modes, STEM (Figure 3b) and InLens (Figure 3c), reﬂecting thevesicularmorphologyandthehomogeneoussizedistribution of the nanosystems.

AdvancedHealthcareMaterialspublishedbyWiley-VCHGmbH www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de AFM images plain NEs are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting In- formation). Additionally, AFM images using the magnetic force microscopy mode were carried out, in view of the magnetic re- sponseoftheMFOnanoparticlesencapsulatedinthenanoemul- sions.The MFM mode allows the study of magnetic forces at the nanoscale, by scanning the gradient of magnetic force on the sample surface while simultaneously obtaining the topo- graphic map.Accordingly, Figure 3 includes a 10 ×10μm2- general overview of the VitE-MFO-NEs in phase contrast (Fig- ure 3h) and MFM (Figure 3i) modes.
Both images evidence the correlation between the NEs and the magnetic contrast stem- mingfromtheVitE-MFOnanoparticles.Inthisregard,whilethe topographyimage(Figure3h)showsthetypicalcontrastbetween the sample and the substrate, and no phase contrast due to the magneticparticles,theMFMmodedoesexhibitagreatercontrast becauseofthemanganeseferriteinthepresenceofa40mTmag- neticﬁeld(operatingat100kHzwithaliftheightof88nmabove thesurfaceofthesample)overthesamearea(Figure3i).
Indeed, the contrast varies gradually along with the scanning area, due to the overall response of the magnetic nanoparti- cles to the magnetized microscope tip (in this situation, black and white contrast refers to repulsive and attractive magnetic forces between the sample and the tip, respectively, as observed in similar analysis with magnetite and magnetite-coated silica spheres).[38,39]Furtherinvestigationsonthecontrastsignalofthe MFMmodewiththeliftheightwerecarriedout,suchthattheim- agesobtained(FigureS3,SupportingInformation)revealthatthe magneticsignalfaintswithincreasingtheliftheight.Thisstems fromthefactthatmagneticinteractionsaredistancedependent, and accordingly, the larger the lift height the weaker the mag- neticinteractionsestablishedbetweenthenanoparticlesandthe tip of the MFM mode, eﬀect not implied when considering the phase contrast signal. This scenario just reinforces the eﬃcient encapsulationofmagneticVitE-MFOnanoparticlesintotheNEs, aspreviouslydiscussed.
ThemagneticcharacterizationofthefreeVitE-MFOnanopar- ticles before and after encapsulation into the NEs (VitE-MFO- NEs) isincluded in Figure 4. Figure4a(black) includes thehys- teresis loop of the sample of nanoparticles at 300 K), reﬂecting theverysmallcoercivityapproachingzeroatroomtemperature.
Thisisgenerallyassociatedtothesuperparamagneticbehaviorof nanoparticleswithaverysmallmagnetocrystallineanisotropyin agreement with the soft nature of the ferrimagnetic manganese ferrite.[40]Thevalueofsaturationmagnetization( MS)wasfound to be 57.0 Am2kg−1at room temperature, which are smaller thanthetabulatedvalueofthebulkmanganeseferrite,inagree- ment with the non-stoichiometry already mentioned.[16,18,41] The ﬁeld-dependent magnetization hysteresis loop at 300 K of the magnetic VitE-MFO nanoparticles once trapped inside the NEs is also included in Figure 4a (in red), conﬁrming the superparamagnetic behavior of the manganese ferrite nanopar- ticlesaftertheirencapsulationintoNEs,andshowingadecrease in the value of magnetization per mass of sample, given the rather large weight percentage of the diamagnetic organic lipid nanoemulsions.[42,43]This also indicates there is no structural or chemical degradation of the manganese ferrite magnetic material after the entrapment process, rendering therefore the magnetic NEs suitable for MRI applications.
Furthermore, the ZFC/FC temperature-dependent magnetization curves reﬂectthe superparamagnetic behavior of the nanoparticles employed, (Figure 4b), exhibiting a blocking temperature ( TB)a tv e r yl o w temperature( ≈60K).Theabsenceofaﬂatplateaubelow TBinthe FC curve is a clear indicator that no strong dipolar interactions are taken place between nanoparticles, even in the powdered samples.Itshouldbenotedthattheblockingtemperatureofthe nanoparticles is located at a relatively high temperatures as the measurement is performedwith thesample as compacted pow- der, and therefore, with the nanoparticles strongly interacting. In case of having the nanoparticles far apart, this temperature woulddecrease.Inthecaseofthehysteresisloops,thecoercivity value in the ﬁeld dependent magnetization implies a strongly interacting system.
When shifting from the sample of nanopar- ticlesascompactpowdertothesampleofnanoparticlesgrouped in the NEs, the system becomes less dipolar interacting but the coercivity does not notably change, as shown in Figure 4a, meaningthatthenanoparticlesarestillinteracting. Then,todemonstratethepotentialofthedevelopedVitE-MFO- NEsasnegativeMRIcontrastagents,wehaveevaluatedthemag- netic sensitivity using 9.4 T horizontal MR scanner.Agar-based phantom with diﬀerent concentrations of VitE-MFO and VitE- MFO-NEs were considered to study the dependence of the MR signalintensityonthemetalconcentrationsindicated.Figure4c shows a sequence of T2-weighted images on which we can ap- preciate the gradual enhancement of the negative contrast sig- nal when the iron concentration is increased.This means that indeedtheMFOnanoparticlescanshortenthetransversalrelax- ation time of water protons (T2) and can therefore be eﬃciently usedasnegativeMRcontrastagents.
Moreover, the transverse relaxivity (r2) values resulting from the slope of linear ﬁt between the inverse of transversal relax- ation times (1/T2) versus iron concentrations (´10−3m Fe) are shown in Figure 4d. Free VitE-MFO (dispersed in chloroform) showed high relaxivity values (301.2 ´ 10−3m−1s−1), suitable for T2enhanced MRI.The high relaxivity measured for VitE- MFO was even improved after encapsulation in VitE-MFO-NEs, whose r2value turned out to be twofold higher than VitE-MFO (652.9 ´ 10−3m−1s−1).
The obtained r2values are somehow ex- pected since manganese-doped ferrite nanoparticles have been reportedasgreaterenhancersoftheMRIsignalcomparedtocon- ventional iron oxide nanoparticles.[8–10]Further, we could high- lightthatthevaluesobtainedinthisreportaresixfoldhigherthan ferumoxytol(r2valueof98.4´10−3m−1s−1at7.0T),whichiscur- rentlytheonlyFDA-approvedironoxideformulationusedasoﬀ- labelMRIcontrastagent.[41,44]Wealsoinvestigatedtheirpotential as dual contrast agents and so, the longitudinal relaxivity (r1)o f VitE-MFO-NEs was calculated (Figure S4, Supporting Informa- tion).Themeasuredr1valuewasverylow(0.653´10−3m−1s−1), whichisinagreementwithothersystemsmeasuredathighmag- netic ﬁelds.[45]This just implies that VitE-MFO can be used as strong T2contrast agents at 9.4 T ﬁeld, but cannot work as T1 contrastagent.Whilethetransverserelaxivityvaluesofnanopar- ticles are directly dependent on magnetic saturation magnetiza- tion the theoretical models accounting for the transverse relax- ation of magneticmaterials relyon thefact that particlescan be subjectedtothemotionalaverageregime(MAR,if Δ𝜔𝜏D<1)or be in the static dephasing regime (SDR, if Δ𝜔𝜏D>1).

Thus, according to equation (1), a lower value of r2can be expectedforVitE-MFO-NEs,consideringthelowermagneticsat- urationtheydisplayifcomparedtothefreeMFOnanoparticles.
However,withinthenanoemulsionsthemagneticnanoparticlescan establish strong dipolar interactions, that can be therefore relatedtothehighr2valuesregistered.[18,46,47] With the aim to investigate the in vivo MR applications of VitE-MFO-NEs we ﬁrst evaluated their in vivo biocompatibility inSprague-Dawleyratsbymeasuringbiologicalparametersthat can indicate the safety/toxicity of these nanosystems. It is well known that most of the nanoparticles are sequestered by the liverafterintravenousadministrationandthus,itisthemainor- gan that can be damaged due to nanoparticle accumulation.[48] In addition, kidneys also play a crucial role in the accumulation of metabolized nanoparticles before their elimination through the urine.
In this sense, we have injected VitE-MFO-NEs intra- venously(1mL,471 ×10−6mFe,1.88 μmolFekg−1,n=4)and PBS pH 7.4 as control in healthy rats, and measured the blood levels of Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase (GOT) and cre- atinine at diﬀerent time points, as biomarkers for hepatic and renal damage, respectively.

Liver, lungs, kidneys and spleen were placed in agar-based phantoms andT2-weightedimageswereacquiredwith9.4ThorizontalMR scanner.Figure5bshowsT2-mapsofanimal ’sorganscalculated from T2-weighted images. To quantify the hyposignal caused by VitE-MFO-NEs, T2relaxation times of the control organs (from rats injected with PBS) were measured and a mean of the min- imum values were selected as a threshold, which was applied to the treated animals.Relaxation times lower than the selected threshold indicate the presence of VitE-MFO-NEs in the organs and these pixels were marked in red in Figure 5b.
As shown in Figure5b,c,VitE-MFO-NEsareaccumulatedmainlyinliverand kidneys 48 h post-administration, in agreement with other NEs describedforthisapplications.[30,31,49]Itisalsonoteworthytheab- senceofnanoparticlesinlungs,whichcouldbeanindicativethat the VitE-MFO-NEs are stable and do not aggregate causing ob- structioninthepulmonarycapillaries.Therefore,ourresultsin- dicatethatVitE-MFO-NEsarebiocompatibleandcanbedetected byexvivoMRIatextremelylowdosesrelatedtotheirhightrans- verserelaxivity.[50]Apart from whole-body imaging applications, MRI is one of thepreferredtechniquesinthediagnosisofneurologicalpatholo- giesduetoitshighspatiotemporalresolutionandunlimitedtis- sue penetration depth, allowing the use of multiple sequences tovisualizeandevaluatethefunctionalityandstructureofdiﬀer- ent brain regions.[51,52]For this reason, we also have performed a proof of concept in vivo study to evaluate the potential appli- cation of the VitE-MFO-NE as contrast agents in the brain.
NEs andVitE-MFO-NEswereinjectedintherighthemisphereofthe brain (10 μL, 471×10−6m Fe, 0.018 μmol Fe kg−1,n=3), and as a control, PBS was injected in the left hemisphere ( n=3).

successfully synthesized by thermodecomposition of the metal precursors and coated for the ﬁrst time with the antioxidant VitaminEtoobtainhydrophobicnanoparticles.Then,VitE-MFO were encapsulated into biocompatible VitE/SM NEs providing good-sized, homogeneous, negative charged and highly stable formulations suitable for biomedical applications. Moreover, morphologicalcharacterizationofVitE-MFO-NEsconﬁrmedthe narrowdistributionoftheparticlesandtheeﬃciententrapment of VitE-MFO into their inner core.We have demonstrated the magnetic properties of VitE-MFO-NEs by conﬁrming that the superparamagnetic behavior of the nanoparticles was not compromised after encapsulation.
In vitro MR studies of VitE- MFO and VitE-MFO-NEs showed a great enhancement of the T2-weighted MR contrast, being signiﬁcantly higher for VitE- MFO-NEs.Moreover,wehaveprovedtheinvivobiocompatibility ofVitE-MFO-NEsandconﬁrmedthattheycanbedetectedbyex vivoMRIandinvivoMRbrainimaging.Insummary,thiswork provides an exhaustive characterization of biocompatible mag- neticnanoemulsionsthatpossessanultrahighT2contrastability andcaneﬃcientlyincreasethesensitivityorMRIandthus,open agateforpossibleapplicationsinbiomedicalimaging. 4.ExperimentalSection Materials:Manganese(II)acetylacetonate(Mn(acac)2,98%),iron(III) acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3, 98%), (±)-𝛼-tocopherol (96%, VitE) used for the coating of the magnetic nanoparticles, folic acid ( >9 7 % ,F A ) ,o l e y - lamine (70%), benzyl ether (98%) and agar were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.MilliQ water (Millipore) was used through the study (18.2 M Ω cm resistance).Sphingomyelin was purchased from Lipoid GmbH.
The surfactant C16/C18-COO-C9H9O3was synthesized by GalChimia. Sol- ventsusedsuchasabsoluteethanolandchloroform,wereacquiredfrom CienytechandThermoFisherScientiﬁc.Allotherchemicalsandreagents wereofanalyticalgrade.Synthesis of Manganese Ferrite Nanoparticles (MFO) :The nanopar- ticles were synthesized by the chemical thermodecomposition of the manganese and iron metal precursors, following a procedure published elsewhere.[53]Brieﬂy,Fe(acac)3(1.33mmol),Mn(acac)2(0.67mmol),1,2- dodecanediol (10 mmol), OA (6 mmol), oleylamine (6 mmol), and ben- zyl ether (20 mL) were mixed and magnetically stirred.The mixture was heatedtoreﬂuxupto200 °Cfor2handthen,heatedupto300 °Cfor1h.
Theblack-coloredmixturewasallowedtocooldowntoroomtemperature, andthecolloidswerewashedthreetimesinethanolbycentrifugationand driedbylettingthesolventevaporate.Thesenuclei(84mg)wereusedas seeds, repeating the previous protocol, in order to have a second step of growthtoattain10nmaveragediametermanganeseferritenanoparticles. Inthissecondstep,themixturewasﬁrstheatedtoreﬂuxupto200 °Cfor 1 h, and then heated up to 300 °C for 30 min.Afterwards, colloids were washed in ethanol by centrifugation and dispersed in chloroform while adding oleic acid (0.8 mmol into a 5 mL solution of the MnFe2O4parti- cles, 2 mg mL−1).
An additional step by which exchanging the oleic acid moleculesby( ±)-𝛼-tocopherolwascarriedout.Forthat,5mLoftheprevi- oussolutionofthemanganeseferritenanoparticles(2mgmL−1)wereﬁrst transferred into 5 mL of cyclohexane including 1 mmol of 𝛼-tocopherol, mixed and stirred at room temperature for 2 h, to promote the ligand ex- change.Thesolutionwasfurtherdiluted,upto10mLofcyclohexane,and heated at 60 °C for 1 h. Finally, the colloids were washed with a mixture of ethanol/cyclohexane by centrifugation.The resultant product was dis- persedinchloroform,withaconcentrationof2mgmL−1(referredtothe inorganiccore).Adv.Healthcare Mater.2021,10,2101019 2101019(9of12) ©2021TheAuthors.AdvancedHealthcareMaterialspublishedbyWiley-VCHGmbH www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de Characterization of MFO :Transmission electron microscopy mea- surements were performed on a JEOL JEM 1010 instrument operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV.
Nanoparticles for the TEM analy- sis were prepared by dropping a diluted suspension of the sample onto an ultrathin carbon-coated copper grid. X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) patterns were collected by using a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diﬀractometer (CuKa radiation, 𝜆=1.54056 Å)).Raman spectra were collected with a Ren- ishaw in Via Reﬂex Raman Microscope.Experiments were conducted at room temperature by using an excitation wavelength of 785 nm.ICP- OES measurements were conducted by treating the samples with nitric acid (2 vol%) while heated at 120 °C and analyzed in an Optima 4300DV (PerKin Elmer).Magnetic measurements of VitE-MFO and VitE-MFO- NEs were performed by using a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) from Quantum Design.Hysteresis loops were measured at 10 and 300 K applying a magnetic ﬁeld up to 5 T (or up to 3 T for VitE-MFO samples).Thetemperature-dependentmagnetizationinzero-ﬁeld-cooling (ZFC)andﬁeld-cooling(FC)conditionswasperformedat10mTinthe2– 330 K range.
The magnetic measurements were performed using dried powderedsamples. FormulationofNEsandVitE-MFO-NEs :Oilinwater(O/W)nanoemul- sions were prepared by ethanol injection.Brieﬂy, vitamin E (5 mg), sph- ingomyelin (0.5 mg) and C16/C18-COO-C9H9O3(0.5 mg) were dissolved in 100 μL of absolute ethanol with the lipid ratio 1:0.1:0.1 w/w.
The or- ganicphasewasinjectedin1mLofMilliQwaterusinganinsulinsyringe (0.5 mL, 0.33 ×12 mm ICO.C.1) under magnetic stirring giving a total lipidconcentrationof5.5mgmL−1.Theencapsulationofmanganesefer- rite nanoparticles coated with vitamin E (VitE-MFO) into the nanoemul- sions was performed by the addition of 120 μg of VitE-MFO dissolved in chloroform(12mgmL−1)totheorganicphasewiththelipidssuspended inethanol.Thisphasewassonicatedfor5mininanicebathandinjected withaninsulinsyringeintowater.Thesuspensionwaskeptunder orbital agitation for 10 min at room temperature to reduce the residual traces ofchloroform.Basedontheirhydrophobicity,non-encapsulatednanopar- ticles precipitate in aqueous medium after centrifugation and they were removedbycollectingthesupernatantanddiscardingtheprecipitate.
Physicochemical Characterization :NEs and VitE-MFO-NEs were char- acterizedintermsoftheirhydrodynamicdiameterandcorrespondentsize distribution, which is deﬁned by the polydispersity index (PDI), by Dy- namic Light Scattering (DLS) using a Nanosizer 2000 (Malvern Instru- ments).ThemeasurementsweremadebydilutingsamplesinMilliQwater (dilution 1:10) in disposable microcuvettes (ZEN0040, Brand). The zeta potential (ZP) was measured by laser Doppler anemometry (LDA).To do the measurement, a dilution 1:40 of the nanoemulsions in MilliQ water wasdisposedinfoldedcapillarycellscuvettes(DTS1070,MalvernInstru- ments).NEs and VitE-MFO-NEs were also characterized by Nanoparti- cle Tracking Analysis (NTA) diluting the particles 1:1000 in MilliQ water (NanoSight LM20).Data were collected with 3 captures of 60 s and both shutterandgainweremanuallydeterminedforeachsample.TA2.0Build 127 software was used for measurement and subsequent data analysis.
For stability studies, size and PDI of the nanoemulsions were measured along time after incubation of the particles in diﬀerent media at 37 °C: Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s culture medium (DMEM, Merck Group), salinesolution(sodiumchloride,NaCl0.9%)andphosphatebuﬀer(PBS, 10×10−3m).Alltheformulationsandmeasurementswereperformedat leastintriplicate. Morphological Characterization :The morphology of the NEs and VitE-MFO-NEs was observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Atomic Forces Microscopy (AFM).For NEs, 20 μL of nanoemulsions (0.5 mg mL−1) were stained with 20 μL phosphotungstic acid (2% w/v) and placed on a carbon coated grid.The excess was washed with MilliQ waterandthegridwasallowedtodryovernightatroomtemperature.FE- SEMimageswereacquiredusingaZEISSFESEMULTRAPlus,microscope withtwodetectors,STEM,andInLens.CharacterizationofVitE-MFO-NEs was done by the same method described above for free MFO.
AFM char- acterization was performed in a Scanning Probe Microscopy Multimode Multimode 8/Nanoscope V operating in tapping mode. The MFM mode was employed using a Tip Roc <35 nm (radius) with a CoCr coating,working at a nominal frequency of 75–100 kHz and a nominal coercivity of 40 mT.Samples for AFM/MFM were prepared in Millipore water and allowedtodryoveramicasubstrateovernightatroomtemperature.InVitroMRImaging :MRimagingwasperformedbyagar-basedphan- toms prepared following a procedure described elsewhere.[54]Agar solu- tion (1.6% w/v) was used to prepare a mold with several wells.Diﬀerent dilutions of the nanoemulsions were prepared in order to obtain serial concentrations of manganese ferrite nanoparticles ranging from 0.006 to 0.471×10−3mFe.Then,100 μLofmagneticnanocarriersweremixedwith 100μLofagarsolution,depositedintoagarwellsandcoveredwiththere- maining agar solution.For VitE-MFO phantoms dilutions were made in ethanol and then mixed with agar solution.
MR images were acquired on aBrukerBiospec9.4TsmallanimalMRscanner(horizontalboremagnet with 12 cm wide Bruker BioSpin) equipped with actively shielded gradi- ents(440mTm−1).Fortheacquisitionofdata,aradiofrequencyresonator (Bruker)wasusedastransmitter-receiver(quadraturevolumecoil7cmin diameter). T2-weighted images were acquired using the multi-slice multi-spin- echo(MSME)sequencewith10.26msofechotime,3sofrepetitiontime, 16 echoes with 10.26 ms echo spacing, 50 kHz spectral bandwidth, ﬂip angle of 90 °, 14 slices of 1 mm, 1 average.T2-weighted images were ob- tained with a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 7.5 ×7.5 cm (with saturation bands tosuppresssignaloutsidethisFOV),andamatrixsizeof300 ×300,giv- ing an in-plane resolution of 250 μm/pixel and implemented without fat suppression.
Images were processed, and their T2-maps were calculated usingthesoftwareFIJI:ImageJ(RasbandW,NIH).Therelaxivityconstant (r2) was calculated as the slope of the curve obtained by ﬁtting the T2−1 valuesversustheFeconcentrationin ×10−3m. In Vivo Studies :Animal experiments were conducted in the Clini- cal Neurosciences Research Laboratory of the University Clinical Hos- pital of Santiago de Compostela (REGA ES 15078 029 2801).All exper- imental animal procedures were conducted under the procedure num- ber: 15010/2019/004 approved by the Animal Care Committee, accord- ing to European Union Rules and the Spanish regulation (86/609/CEE, 2003/65/CE, 2010/63/EU, RD1201/2005 and RD53/2013, RD 53/2013).Sprague-Dawley rats with a weight between 250 and 300 g were used for in vivo studies.In all the experiments animals were anesthetized placing theminastereotaxicframe(StoeltingCo.,WoodDale)undersevoﬂurane anesthesia.
In Vivo Biocompatibility of VitE-MFO-NEs :VitE-MFO-NEs ( n=4, 2.7 mg lipids mL−1, 471×10−6m Fe) were injected through the tail vein in anesthetized rats (1 mL, 10.9 mg lipids kg−1,1 . 8 8 μmol Fe kg−1)a n d hepaticandrenaltoxicitieswereassessedmeasuringGlutamateOxaloac- etateTransaminaseenzyme(GOT)andCreatininelevelsatdiﬀerenttime points (prior injection and 2, 4, 24, 48 h post-injection).The same vol- ume of PBS was intravenously injected as a control.At the selected time points, blood was extracted from the tail vain and collected in tubes with heparin (BD Vacutainer Heparin Blood Collection Tubes).Then, 32 μLo f blood were placed in reactive strips for GOT (ref: 10745120202 Roche), andcreatinine(ref:10886874202Roche)andanalyzedinaReﬂotronplus (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).GOT levels were normalized to the baseline levelsofeachanimal.
Ex Vivo MRI :After 48 h from PBS/VitE-MFO-NEs intravenous injec- tion (n=4), animals were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 100 mL PBS 0.1 M pH 7.4 and 150 mL 4% formaldehyde (VWR Chem- icals, Leuven, Belgium). Organs (lungs, kidneys, liver and spleen) were carefully removed and postﬁxed by immersion in 4% formaldehyde until MRI analysis.Agar-based phantoms were prepared with these organs in order to determine T2relaxation times.MR images were acquired follow- ingtheprotocolpreviouslydescribedforinvitroMRIstudiesandT2-maps werecalculatedfromT2-weightedimages.Imageanalysiswasperformed selecting each control organ as a region of interest (ROI) and measuring a mean of the minimum relaxation times values.These values were ﬁxed asthresholdandwereappliedtotheorganstreatedwithVitE-MFO-NEsin ordertoquantifythediﬀerencescausedbytheseparticlesintherelaxation times.
In Vivo Brain MRI :For brain MR imaging VitE-MFO-NEs, VitE-NEs and PBS were injected directly in the parenchyma of the animals ( n=3, Adv.

Transmission and reception coils were ac- tively decoupled from each other.Gradient-echo pilot scans were per- formedatthebeginningofeachimagingsessionforaccuratepositioning of the animal inside the magnet bore.
In order to assess nanoparticles in vivo, animals were scanned following T2-weighted and T2*-weighted se- quences in MRI to evaluate the presence and the distribution 1 h after theinjection.T2*-weightedimageswereacquiredusingaMGEsequence witha2.9msechotime,1.5srepetitiontime,16echoeswith3.28msecho spacing,implementedwithaFAof30 °,2averages,14slicesof1mm,and witha19.2 ×19.2mm2FOV,a192 ×192imagematrix(isotropicin-plane resolution of 100 μmp i x e l−1).
