Sarcopenia occurs in 8–13% of adults ≥60 years of age and can lead to disability, frailty, and vario us other diseases.Overthepastfewdecades,severalleadingresear chgroupshavefocusedtheir efforts on developing strategies and recommendations for a ttenuating sarcopenia. One potential nutritional intervention for sarcopenia is crea tine supplementation.However, research is inconsistent regarding the effectiveness of cr eatine on aging muscle.The purpose of this perspective paper is to: (1) propose possibl e reasons for the inconsistent responsivenesstocreatineinagingadults,(2)discussthe potentialmechanisticactionsof creatineonmusclebiology,(3)determinewhetherthetimin gofcreatinesupplementation inﬂuences aging muscle, (4) evaluate the evidence investig ating the effects of creatine with other compounds (protein, conjugated linoleic acid) i n aging adults, and (5) provide insight regarding the safety of creatine for aging adults.
Keywords: muscle, strength, resistance training, mechanisms , safety INTRODUCTION The original criteria for determining sarcopenia focused on muscle quantity ( 1); however, over the past few decades, numerous groups (International Working Group on Sarcopenia, Special Interest Group, European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older P eople, Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, Asian Working Group on Sarco penia, European Society of Clinical NutritionandMetabolism,andInternationalSarcopeniaInit iative)haveexpandedthiscriterionto include muscle strength and physical performance measures ( 2). Sarcopenia, now identiﬁed with anICD-10-CMcodebytheWorldHealthOrganization( 3)occursin8–13%ofadults ≥60yearsof age (4).
The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People class iﬁes aging adults with lowmusclestrength(Gripstrengthtest: <27kgformales, <16forfemales;Chairstandtest: >15s for ﬁve stands) as being pre-sarcopenic; those with low muscle s trength and low muscle quantity (Appendicular skeletal muscle mass: <20kg for males, <15kg for females; Appendicular skeletal musclemass/height2:<7.0kg/m2formales, <6.0kg/m2forfemales)asbeingsarcopenic,andthose Candow et al. Creatine and Sarcopenia with low muscle strength, low muscle quantity and low physica l performance (Gait speed: ≤0.8 m/s; Short Physical Performance Battery test: ≤8 point score; Timed Up-and Go test: ≥20s; 400m walk test: non-completion or ≥6min for completion) as having severe sarcopenia ( 5).Sarcopenia is associated with disability, frailty, cachexia, morbidity, and various dis eases (6,7).
Contributing factors of sarcopenia include changes in neuromuscular function, skeletal muscle morphology, protei n kinetics,hormonalregulation,oxidativeandinﬂammatory stress, physicalinactivity,andnutrition[forreviewssee( 8,9)]. The European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Disease s [ESCEO; ( 10)] and International Conference on Sarcopenia and Frailty Research task force ( 11) recommends that nutritional interventions be emphasized to help overcome sarcopenia.We propose that creatine supplementation has the potential to be an anti-sarcopenic intervention.Three meta-analyses have b een performed involving creatine supplementation and resistance training.In the ﬁrst meta-analysis, Candow et al.
( 12) found a greater eﬀect from creatine supplementation during resistanc e training on muscle mass ( +0.94kg) and upper-body maximal strength compared to placebo during resistance training in ov er 300participants( >50yearsofage).Expandingontheseﬁndings, Devries and Phillips ( 13) showed that creatine supplementation during resistance training resulted in greater gains in mus cle mass (+1.33kg) and upper- and lower-body maximal strength, and physical performance (30-s chair stand test) compared to placebo during training in over 200 aging adults ( >45 years of age). In the most recent meta-analysis, Chilibeck et al.(14) showed that creatine supplementation during resistance training signiﬁcantly increased muscle mass ( +1.37kg), and upper- and lower-body maximal strength compared to placebo during resistance training in over 700 aging adults ( >57 years of age).
Collectively, these meta-analyses indicate t hat the addition of creatine to resistance training signiﬁcant ly increases muscle mass (1.21kg), maximum strength and has promise for improving tasks of physical performance in aging adults. However, variability in the responsiveness to creat ine supplementation is typically high in aging adults and several factors determine whether an individual experiences greate r gains in muscle mass and muscle/physical performance from creatine supplementation and resistance training.
Therefor e, the purpose of this perspective paper is to: (1) propose possible reasons for the inconsistent responsiveness to creatine in aging adults, (2) discuss the potential mechanistic actions of creatine on muscle biology, (3) determine whether the timin g of creatine supplementation inﬂuences aging muscle, (4) evalua te the evidence investigating the eﬀects of creatine with other compounds (protein, conjugated linoleic acid) in aging adult s, and (5) provide insight regarding the safety of creatine for agingadults. Creatine Creatine (methylguanidine-acetic acid) is a naturally occ urring nitrogenous organic acid ( 15).Ninety-ﬁve percent of creatine is stored in skeletal muscle while the remainder is found in bra in, liver, kidneys, and testes ( 16).In skeletal muscle, approximately two-thirds of creatine is bound to phosphate and stored asphosphocreatine (PCr), the remaining one-third of creatine i s unbound and stored as free creatine ( 15).
An average 70-kg individual maintains a total creatine pool (PCr +free Cr= total creatine) of ∼120 mmol/kg of dry muscle mass ( 17). Approximately 2 g/day (1–2%) of intramuscular creatine stores are broken down and excreted in the urine as creatinine ( 15).Bothexogenousdietaryintakeandendogenous denovosynthesis are used to replace lost creatine.Dietary sources of creatine include meat, ﬁsh, and poultry with trace amounts in plants (18,19).For example, one pound of uncooked salmon and beef contains about 2g of creatine ( 18).Since plants only contain trace amounts, strict vegetarians and vegans typically have lower skeletal muscle total creatine stores ( 20).For most individuals, ∼1–3 g/d of exogenous creatine intake are required to maintai n creatine stores depending on total muscle mass and physical activitylevels( 17,18,21).Endogenous denovocreatinesynthesis occurs in the liver and kidney ( 15,18) via a two-step process.
First, arginine and glycine form ornithine and guanidinoac etic acid (GAA) by the enzyme arginine glycine amidinotransferas e (AGAT).Second,creatineisformedbythetransferofthemet hyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to guanidinoacetate ( 22), as shownin Figure1. Creatine Supplementation During Resistance Training in Aging Adults There is a growing body of literature examining the eﬀects of creatine supplementation and resistance training in aging adults (Table1).Individual studies involving aging males or agingmalesandfemalescombinedshowmixedresults.However , studies only involving aging females show more consistent results.This section will summarize ﬁndings across studies and discuss possible methodological reasons for the conﬂictin g results.Furthermore, variables inﬂuencing the responsive ness to creatinesupplementationarealsoproposed.While it is diﬃcult to compare results across studies in aging males, diﬀerences in training methodologies may be involved.In the Candow et al.
( 30) and Chrusch et al. (31) studies (both showing a positive eﬀect from creatine), participants were directly supervised during each training session.However, in the Cooke et al.( 32) study, participants were only supervised during weeks 1, 2, 6, 8, and 11.Supervised resistance training leads to greater muscle beneﬁ ts compared to unsupervised training ( 44).Furthermore, the sample sizes were larger in the Candow et al.( 30) and Chrusch et al.( 31) studies which increased statistical power compared to the Cooke et al.( 32) study.The study by Eijnde et al.( 33) incorporated both resistance and aerobic exercise components into the training intervention which introduces the possibility of muscle interference [i.e., blu nting of muscle growth and performance when performing both resistance-training and aerobic exercise in the same traini ng program; ( 45)].
In addition, the resistance training protocol focused on developing muscular endurance (20–30 repetition range) rather than muscular strength, a primary dependent measureassessed. Five studies have investigated the eﬀects of creatine supplementation during resistance training in aging females, as shown in Table1.In postmenopausal osteopenic or Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 2 August 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 124 Candow et al.Creatine and Sarcopenia FIGURE 1 | Creatine is synthesized endogenously by a two step process f rom glycine, arginine, and methoione or through dietary int ake.Ninety-ﬁve percent of creatine is taken up into the muscle and stored as free creati ne (33%) or as phosphorylcreatine (67%).Approximately 2g p er day is broken down to creatinine and excreted.osteoporotic females, Gualano et al.
( 26) showed that creatine supplementationduringsupervisedresistancetrainingproduc ed greatergains(relative)inappendicularleantissuemass(as sessed by DXA) and upper-body (bench press) strength compared to placeboduring resistancetraining.Previous workby Nevese tal. (27) also found a beneﬁcial eﬀect from creatine on lower-limb lean tissue mass and indices of physical performance (timed- stand test) in postmenopausal women with knee osteoarthritis compared to placebo; however, there was no eﬀect of creatine supplementation on total-body lean mass or muscle strength when compared to placebo.Additional work in postmenopausal women showed that creatine supplementation increased lean tissue mass, strength (bench press, knee extension, biceps curl), and tasks of physical performance (30-s chair stand, arm curl test, lying prone-to-stand test) compared to placebo (24).Chilibeck et al.
( 25) showed that postmenopausal females who ingested creatine daily during supervised whole-body resistance training experienced greater gains in relative u pper- body maximal strength (bench press) compared to females on placebo. Finally, postmenopausal women who ingested creatine during a supervised strength training program had greater gains in lower-body (leg press) strength compared to females who ingested creatine or placebo but did not strength train.There were no diﬀerences between females who consumed creatine or placebo during training ( 23).Collectively, these results suggest that creatine supplementation during supervi sed resistance training is an eﬀective lifestyle intervention f or improving muscle mass and muscle/physical performance in agingpostmenopausalwomen.
Research is limited regarding the eﬀectiveness of creatine supplementation during resistance training in aging males an d females combined, and therefore, there are only a few directcomparisons between males and females for responsiveness to creatine, as shown in Table1. Brose et al.( 36) showed that creatine supplementation increased lean tissue mass and isometric knee extension strength in aging adults compared t o placebo.Malesoncreatineincreasedankle-dorsiﬂexioniso metric strength more than females on creatine.Candow et al.( 37) and Pinto ( 42) found increases in strength and lean tissue mass with creatine and resistance training compared to placebo ; however, no sex diﬀerences were found.Johannsmeyer et al.(41) showed that creatine supplementation increased whole- body lean tissue mass compared to placebo.
Males on creatine increased upper-body strength (lat pull-down) and decreased urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion (indicator or whole- body protein catabolism) more than females on creatine.

Methodological Differences Between Studies Collectively, inconsistent results across studies (independ ent of sex), may be related to diﬀerences in the exercise training intervention (i.e., supervision vs. non-supervision; durat ion and volume of training; combination of aerobic and resistance training),healthstatusandsamplesize.Furthermore, variables which inﬂuence an individual’s responsiveness to creatine supplementation should also be considered( 46–48).Variables Inﬂuencing Individual Responses to Creatine (A) Baseline Muscle Creatine Content The magnitude of response to creatine supplementation is typically determined by initial muscle creatine concentrati on (47), which can be quite variable in aging individuals and across one’s lifespan.Aging adults typically have signiﬁcan tly lower PCr and total creatine compared to young adults ( 49– 52), however one study reported no diﬀerences between older and younger participants ( 53).In contrast, Rawson et al.
( 54) showed that aging adults ( n=7) had higher resting PCr stores comparedtoyoungeradult( n=8)inthegastrocnemiusmuscle. Chilibeck et al.( 14) performed a meta-analysis to assess PCr diﬀerences between young and aging adults.Results showed that when the quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anter ior muscle groups were combined, there were no diﬀerences in muscle PCr across age groups.However, when only studies that assessed the quadriceps were included, there was an age-rela ted reduction in intramuscular PCr, suggesting that muscle grou ps mayresponddiﬀerently.(B) Muscle Fiber Type Differences ThemajorityofintramuscularcreatineisfoundintypeIImus cle ﬁbers (46) which progressively decreases (quantity, size) with aging [for review see Larsson et al.( 8)).

(C) Impact of Habitual Dietary Intake of Creatine Dietary intake of creatine may also inﬂuence the responsivene ss to supplementation.Individuals with low dietary consumption of creatine-containing foods [i.e., meat, seafood, poultry; (15, 19)] typically have low intramuscular creatine concentration s and would therefore respond more favorably to creatine supplementation.For example, Burke et al.
( 55) showed that vegetarians experienced the greatest increase in intramusc ular total creatine (PCr, free Cr) from 8 weeks of creatine supplementation (0.25 g/kg lean tissue mass/day for 7 days + 0.0625 g/kg lean tissue mass/day for 49 days) compared to Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 5 August 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 124 Candow et al.

( 52) showed that omnivores had higher dietary creatine intake pre-supplementation. Ingesti on of creatine signiﬁcantly increased PCr in aging individuals but not in the younger omnivore adults.There is evidence that meat consumption decreases with aging which may inﬂuence the response to creatine supplementation.We recommend that future research determine changes in intramuscular creati ne concentration,typeIImuscleﬁberquantityandsize,anddie tary intake of creatine so that a valid estimate regarding the eﬀec ts of creatinesupplementationinagingadultscanbemade.Mechanisms by Which Creatine Supplementation Affects Muscle Mass in Aging Adults Creatine supplementation may aﬀect some of the mechanisms and pathways (those involving muscle protein synthesis and degradation) that contribute to sarcopenia ( Figure2).
This section provides a review of mechanisms by which creatine mayincreaseenergyavailabilityduringresistancetraini ng,along with the eﬀectiveness (or lack of eﬀectiveness) of creatine supplementation for oﬀsetting the eﬀects of aging on muscle proteinsynthesisanddegradation. Increased Training Volume and Muscle Contraction With Creatine Supplementation Through Increased Energy Provision and Calcium Uptake Into the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Phosphocreatine (PCr) is important for buﬀering ATP levels duringintensemusclecontraction(i.e.,resistancetrain ing).ATP, which is broken down to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi)during muscle contraction, can be quickly re-synthesized wh en PCr donates its phosphate to ADP ( 15).Low intramuscular PCr levels may not be able to sustain continued muscle contractions during resistance training.
Aging adults hav e reduced intramuscular PCr levels in the upper-leg (vastus lateralis); whereas PCr levels are at normal levels in muscle s of the lower-leg (gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior), those in volved in low-intensity activities of daily living (i.e., walking ) (14). Potentially, the reduction in PCr in the vastus lateralis may be associated with reduced participation in high-intensity physic al activities (i.e., running, jumping) which involve recruitm ent of large muscle groups in the lower-limbs ( 56).There is strong evidence from studies measuring creatine and PCr levels eit her through muscle biopsies or31P-MRS that supplementation with creatineincreasesmusclecreatineand/orPCrlevelsinmus cleof agingadults( 33,36,51,52,54).Ananimalmodel ofsenescence- accelerated mice indicated that creatine supplementation ma y lose its eﬀectiveness over time due to down-regulation of the creatine transporter protein in muscle; however, this was not evidentinaginghumans( 57).
Increased intramuscular PCr may provide greater capacity for ATP resynthesis during sustained intense muscular work or may enhance PCr recovery (i.e., and therefore greater recov ery between sets of resistance training exercise) because an inc rease of creatine in the muscle would drive recovery of PCr through the reverse of the creatine kinase reaction (i.e., ATP +Cr→ PCr+ADP) (51). Furthermore, creatine increases the rate of calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum which may increase myoﬁbrillar cross-bridge cycling leading to short ened muscle relaxation time and greater force development ( 58–60).Overall, this may lead to enhanced training volume during resistance training sessions in aging adults.In a study with full exercise supervision, where sets were performed with repetiti ons Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 6 August 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 124 Candow et al.
Creatine and Sarcopenia to failure, aging males ( ∼70 years) were able to achieve a 31% greater training volume (deﬁned as repetitions ×kg) when supplemented with creatine compared to placebo during 12 weeks of resistance training ( 31). This has potential to stimulate greater training adaptations (i.e., greater incr eases in muscle mass and strength).This beneﬁcial eﬀect of creatine m ay not hold true however if resistance training is not performed to failure, which may be the case most of the time when older adults are performing resistance training non-supervi sed.Furthermore, in young participants, creatine supplementation was able to maintain resistance training volume and attenua te the interference eﬀect of concurrent training (i.e., resist ance and aerobictraining)onstrengthadaptations( 61).Theseresultsmay haveimportantimplicationsinolderadults,sincebothresis tance andaerobictrainingarerecommendedandcommonlypracticed foroptimalhealth.
Aside from PCr, glycogen is an important substrate that can drive re-phosphorylation of ATP during prolonged resistance training sessions, as evidenced by signiﬁcant glycogen depl etion during resistance training ( 62). Adults ( >50 years) with type II diabetes who supplemented with creatine (5 g/day) during 12 weeks exercise training (aerobic and resistance trainin g, 3x/week) experienced a greater increase in membrane GLUT-4 content and membrane total GLUT-4 content ratio compared to adults on placebo ( 40).GLUT-4 is important for transport of glucose into muscle, and since glucose is a building block for glycogen, this has potential to enhance glycogen resynth esis following resistance training.Creatine supplementation in r ats for 5 days before intermittent swimming spared gastrocnemiu s muscle glycogen when measured post-exercise ( 63).
Blood lactate levels during exercise were also reduced with creat ine supplementation suggesting that extra energy provided by phosphorylcreatineduringtheintermittentexerciseresult edina smallerrequirementforanaerobicglycolysis,allowingspa ringof glycogen.Potentially,thesparingofmuscleglycogenwould allow forgreaterexercisetrainingcapacityandvolumetobeperfor med leadingtogreatermusclemassandmuscle/physicalperforman ce overtime. Aging and Pathways for Protein Synthesis—Effects of Creatine Supplementation Resistance training increases the release of insulin-like g rowth factor-1frommuscle,whichmaystimulateactivationofprot eins called“myogenicregulatoryfactors”[MRFs;( 64,65)].TheMRFs are involved in activation, proliferation, and diﬀerentiati on of satellite cells ( 66), which in turn are involved in muscle ﬁber repair/regeneration and thought to be important in the process of muscle hypertrophy ( 67).
Satellite cells reside outside the muscle ﬁber between the sarcolemma and basal membrane and when activated they fuse with the muscle ﬁber membrane and cross the sarcolemma where they diﬀerentiate into myonuclei (67), which increases a muscle ﬁber’s capacity for protein synthesis ( 68). Myostatin is a myokine (i.e., a hormone-like protein released from muscle) that has the opposite eﬀect to MRFs and inhibits satellite cell activation ( 69).There is a reduction in satellite cell number with aging ( 70), and a reduced activation and proliferation of satellite cells in response t o asession of resistance training ( 71).In young muscle, MRFs are increased and myostatin is reduced following a resistanc e training session, which leads to activation and proliferati on of satellitecells( 71).Theseresponsesareattenuatedwithaging( 71).
Although there is some evidence for creatine supplementation during resistance training to increase production of IGF-1, expression of MRFs, and activation of satellite cells in younger individuals ( 72–74), there is no evidence of this in aging adults. Males (55–70 years) had no increase (compared to placebo) in IGF-1 when supplemented with creatine (20 g/d for 5 days +0.1 g/kg on training days thereafter) during 12 weeks of resistance training ( 32).In aging males (mean age 73 years) who supplemented with creatine (5 g/day) for 7 weeks, there was no greater increase in satellite cell’s or expression of MRFs in response to resistance training compared to placebo ( 75).
Furthermore, during surgical overload of the plantaris musc le in aging rats, creatine supplementation failed to aﬀect myonuclea r domain (i.e., the amount of myonuclei for a given muscle ﬁber area) and did not aﬀect muscle ﬁber area compared to overloadwithoutcreatine( 76).Thisindicatesunchangedsatellite celldiﬀerentiation. The pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3K]- Akt/protein kinase B [PKB]-mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] is important for activation of translation within musc le and is therefore important for muscle protein synthesis in response to resistance training ( 77).Signaling through mTOR is reduced with aging ( 78) but there is no direct evidence that creatinesupplementationinﬂuencesmTORinagingadults.
Aging and Pathways for Protein Degradation—Effects of Creatine Supplementation In contrast to studies showing a lack of direct eﬀect from creatine supplementation on mechanisms involved in protein synthesis,creatinesupplementationmaybeeﬀectiveforreduci ng muscle protein degradation. In younger males, but not female s, acute supplementation with creatine (i.e., 20 g/day for 5 days followed by 5 g/day for 3–4 days) reduced leucine oxidation and the rate of appearance of leucine in blood after primed continuous intravenous infusion of radio-labe led leucine, indicating reduced protein degradation ( 79).This was accompanied by unchanged protein synthesis in both males and females ( 79).
A global marker of muscle protein degradation, urinary 3-methylhistidine, is reduced in aging males (but n ot agingfemales)whosupplementedwithcreatineduringresistanc e training( 30,41).Itisproposedthatduringthebiologicalprocess of aging, there is damage to the mitochondria, causing defec ts in the respiratory chain, leading to production of reactive oxyg en species (80). Reactive oxygen species can cause mutations in mitochondrial DNA (encoding for respiratory chain proteins) leading to further mitochondrial damage and a vicious cycle (80).Reactive oxygen species can damage cellular membranes, leading to inﬂammation, muscle damage, and muscle protein degradation.Supplementation with creatine may be eﬀective in mitigating this mitochondrial damage, leading to reduce d oxidative stress, inﬂammation, and cellular apoptosis (i.e., cell death).
In cellular studies involving human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( 81) or skin cells (ﬁbroblasts) ( 82), or mouse Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 7 August 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 124 Candow et al. Creatine and Sarcopenia myoblasts ( 83) exposed to oxidative damage, incubation with creatine protected against mutations in mitochondrial DNA o r mitochondrial damage.It was proposed that creatine is taken up by mitochondria, where it helps maintain energy status and function by transferring phosphate groups between sites of energy production (i.e., ATP) and sites of energy consumption (i.e., to re-phosphorylate ADP) ( 81).There is some support for creatine having a similar eﬀect in aging adults.
Compared to a placebo group, middle-aged males (mean age 48 years) who supplemented with 20 g/day of creatine for 7 days had reduced levels of proteolytic enzymes involved in apoptosis and DNA fragmentation, and upregulation of proteins involved in protection against mitochondrial damage after a muscle- damaging exercise session [i.e., 40min of downhill running on a treadmill; ref. ( 84)].In addition, aging males (mean age of 65 years) given a daily multi-ingredient nutritional supplement (containing 2.5g of creatine) during 12 weeks of combined resistance and high-intensity interval training , had reduced levels of inﬂammation (as assessed by tumor necrosi s factor- alpha and interleukin-6) compared to placebo ( 85).In this study, the nutritional supplement also contained calciu m, vitamin D, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; therefore, t he eﬀects could not be attributed solely to the creatine.
Finall y, in an animal model of senescence-accelerated mice, a lifeti me of creatine supplementation was eﬀective at middle age (but not oldest age) for increasing muscle carnosine content ( 86). Carnosine has a number of protective mechanisms within muscle including prevention of glycosylation-induced prote in damage, anti-oxidant eﬀects, and pH buﬀering ( 86).Creatine supplementation was also eﬀective at the middle-age mark for improving muscle function [i.e., attenuating fatigue in the slow- twitch soleus, and enhancing post-fatigue force recovery in fast- twitch extensor digitorum longus; ( 86)].Future longer-term studies of creatine supplementation are needed to determine i f therearesimilarbeneﬁtsinolderadults.In summary, studies determining the mechanisms by which creatine supplementation may enhance muscle accretion in aging adults favor an eﬀect from creatine on reducing muscle protein degradation, mainly through mitigation of mitochondrialdamage.
Does the Timing of Creatine Ingestion Inﬂuence Aging Muscle? It has been previously suggested that the strategic ingestio n of creatine, in close proximity to resistance training, may h elp create a favorable environment for muscle growth ( 87).This sectionsummarizesthelimitedbodyofresearchinvestigat ingthe eﬀects of the timing of creatine supplementation in response to resistancetraining.In healthy aging adults who consumed creatine (0.1 g/kg) immediately before and cornstarch maltodextrin (0.1 g/kg) immediatelyafterorcornstarchmaltodextrinimmediatelyb efore andcreatineimmediatelyaftersupervisedwhole-bodyresis tance trainingsessions,signiﬁcantimprovementsinupper-body(ch est press) and lower-body (leg press) maximal strength were observed compared to placebo.There were no diﬀerences instrength gains between the creatine groups; however, only the group who consumed creatine post-exercise had statistically greater gains in lean tissue mass, compared to adults on placeb o (37).
Cribb and Hayes ( 88) found that a multi-ingredient supplement (including protein, carbohydrate, fat, and creatin e monohydrate) in close proximity to training (i.e., immediat ely before and after) increased lean body mass and strength compared to ingesting the supplement in the morning and late evening (i.e., >5h from training) in young resistance trainedparticipants.However,cautioniswarrantedwithamu lti- ingredient study, since the impact of any individual nutrien t is unknown. A small meta-analysis involving 3 studies ( n=80,> 18 years, ranging from 4 to 32 weeks) showed that post-exercise creatine supplementation led to greater gains in muscle mass comparedtopre-exercisecreatine[standardizedmeandiﬀeren ce 0.52,95%CI0.03–1.00, p=0.04;(89)].Therewerenodiﬀerences between pre- and post-exercise creatine for eﬀects on muscle strength.Loennekeetal.( 90,91)haverecentlyprovidedevidence thatexerciseinducedchangesinmusclesizedonotcontribut eto exercise-induced changes in strength.
Creatine has been sh own to enhance training volume ( 24,31), which is important for enhancinggainsinmusclesize,whereastrainingspeciﬁcity seems to be more important for muscle strength ( 92). Although the mechanisms explaining the greater increase in muscle mass from post-exercise creatine remains to be determined, muscle contractions (during a resistance training session) stimul ate creatine uptake into skeletal muscle, resulting in elevated intramuscular creatine stores ( 21).Greater intramuscular PCr is associated with greater muscle accretion in aging adults ( 36).Importantly, no study examining creatine timing has measure d intramuscularcreatinecontent,thusfutureresearchiswa rranted.Although the diﬀerence in muscle accumulation between pre- andpost-exercisecreatineissmall,theseresultsmaybeimpo rtant foragingadultstryingtomaximizemuscleaccretionthrough the combinationofcreatinesupplementationandresistancetrain ing.
Does the Combination of Creatine With Other Nutritional Supplements Augment Muscle Mass and Performance? Research showing a beneﬁcial eﬀect from creatine, in combination with other nutritional supplements, is mixed.Aging males who supplemented with creatine ( n=10; 67.3 ±3.1 years; 0.1 g/kg) and whey protein (0.3 g/kg) only on resistance-training days (3 days/week for 10 weeks) experie nced greater gains in lean tissue mass (5.6 ±0.9%), as measured by air-displacement plethysmography, and upper-body (bench press) strength compared to participants on creatine ( n=13, 65.5±2.7 years; 2.2 ±0.8%) or placebo ( n=12, 64.1±3.1 years; 1.0 ±1.0%) (30).However, in frail adults ( n=18,≥65 years), the combination of creatine (5g) and whey protein (20g) during 12 weeks of resistance training failed to produce greater gains in lean tissue mass, handgrip strength, or ind ices of physical performance (time-up-and-go test, timed stand tes t) compared to whey protein alone ( 38).
In aging males (48–72 years), the co-ingestion of creatine (5g) and whey protein (3 5g) during 14 weeks of resistance training increased whole-bod y Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 8 August 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 124 Candow et al. Creatine and Sarcopenia lean tissue mass and measures of whole-body strength simila rly tothatofcreatineorproteinalone( 28).Furthermore,Villanueva et al.(34) found no diﬀerences in muscle accretion, bench press strength, stair climbing power, or 400-m walk time from the combination of creatine (0.3 g/kg for 5 days +0.07 g/kg for 68 days) and whey protein (35 g/day) during 12 weeks of resistanc e training compared to resistance training alone in aging male s (68.1±6.1 years).Results across individual studies suggest that the combination of creatine and protein does not provide additionalmusclebeneﬁtscomparedtocreatineorproteinalo ne inagingadults.
The ingestion of a multi-ingredient supplement containing creatine (5g), whey protein (60g), vitamin D (1000 IU), EPA (2,800mg), and DHA (1,780mg) for 6 weeks signiﬁcantly increased whole-body lean tissue mass (assessed by DXA), an d upper-body strength in aging males ( n=25, 71±1 years) compared to aging males on placebo( n=24, 74±1 years) (93). Interestingly, continued ingestion of the supplement during 1 2 weeks of supervised aerobic (1x/week) and resistance traini ng (2x/week) did not lead to greater gains in lean tissue mass.Aging adults ( n=21, 65–85 years) who supplemented with creatine(5g)andconjugatedlinoleicacid(CLA;2g)dailyd uring 6 months of resistance training experienced greater gains in muscle accretion (2.1kg) compared to those on placebo ( n =18; 0.9kg increase) ( 43).The combination of creatine and CLA also increased lower-limb isokinetic strength and tota l- bodymuscleendurance(chestpress,armﬂexion,kneeextensi on; females only).
While it is diﬃcult to determine whether creatine is responsible for the greater gains in muscle mass across individuals studies, a recent systematic review and meta- analysis performed by O’Bryan et al. ( 94) concluded that multi- ingredient supplements containing protein and creatine resul ted insigniﬁcantlygreatergainsinmusclemasscomparedtoprote in alone (1.01kg; 95% CI [0.69, 1.33], p<0.00001).Furthermore, Chilibecketal.( 14)showedthatcreatinesupplementationduring resistance training resulted in superior gains in muscle mas s compared to placebo, even when studies involving protein and CLAwereexcludedfromthemeta-analysis.Safety of Creatine Supplementation-Aging Adults and Clinical Populations There is limited research regarding the safety proﬁle of crea tine supplementation.Self-reported adverse eﬀects in aging adults from creatine include muscle cramping, muscle strains and gastrointestinal irritation.Using a retrospective questi onnaire, Chrusch et al.
( 31) reported that 12 weeks of creatine supplementation (0.3 g/kg/day ×5 days+0.07 g/kg/day thereafter) in aging males increased the incidence of muscl e pulls and muscle strains compared to placebo. In aging adults (n=11) who consumed creatine (0.3 g/kg) for 10 days, four adverse events were reports [pulled groin muscle, gastrointestinal irritation, constipation, bloating; ( 95)].In aging postmenopausal women who ingested creatine (0.1 g/kg/day) during 52 weeks of resistance training, ﬁve participants repor ted symptoms of gastrointestinal irritation and two reported mus cle cramping, which was higher ( p<0.05) than the adverse eﬀectsreported by females on placebo ( 25).However, several other studies indicate no adverse eﬀects (self-reported) from crea tine supplementation( 23,29,37,38).There is no direct evidence that creatine supplementation causes cytotoxicity (urinary formaldehyde) in aging males (30) or has an adverse eﬀect on kidney or liver function.
Creatine supplementation (5 g/day) during 14 weeks of resistance training in frail adults resulted in no detrimental eﬀect on kidney or liver function ( 38). In two studies involving aging post-menopausal females, creatine supplementation, with and without resistance training, had no eﬀect on urinary albumin (96) or other markers of kidney (urea, microalbumin, urine protein, creatinine clearance) or liver function (bilirubi n, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, an d alkaline phosphatase) ( 25).The co-ingestion of creatine and CLA during 6 months of resistance training had no eﬀect on bilirubin or gamma glutamyltransferase protein in aging adu lts (43).
From a clinical perspective, creatine supplementation did not alter kidney function (renal damage, hematuria, tubula r damage, glomerular ﬁltration rate, microalbumin) compared t o placebo in aging patients with Parkinson Disease ( 97) or aﬀect albuminuria, proteinuria, albumin: creatinine ratio, urea and creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance in aging adul ts with type II diabetes ( 40). In summary, self-reported adverse events from creatine supplementation include gastrointestin al issues and muscle pulls/strains.Direct assessment of kidne y and liver function indicates no negative eﬀect from creatine in agingadults.CONCLUSIONS Sarcopenia is an age-related muscle condition characterized by a reduction in muscle quantity, muscle performance (i.e., strength) and physical performance (i.e., tasks of functiona lity).Althoughmultifactorial,sarcopeniamaybecausedbychange sin muscle protein kinetics, neuromuscular function, inﬂammat ion, physical activity, and nutrition.
Recent attention has focus ed on nutritional interventions as a potential therapeutic approa ch to counteract sarcopenia. When consumed during resistance training, creatine supplementation typically increases muscle mass and muscle/physical performance, possibly by inﬂuencing high-energy phosphate metabolism and calcium uptake, muscle protein kinetics, and inﬂammation.However, variability in the responsiveness to creatine supplementation is typically high in aging adults and factors such as initial intramuscul ar PCr concentration, type II muscle ﬁber content and size, and habitual dietary intake of creatine may possibly explain the inconsistent ﬁndings across individual studies.Furtherm ore, methodologicalissuessuchassex,exercisetraininginterv ention, sample size, and participant health status may also inﬂuence studyresults.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS DC, SF, PC, SC, JA, and RK contributed to the design, methodology, evaluation, writing, edits, and approval of thesubmission.
