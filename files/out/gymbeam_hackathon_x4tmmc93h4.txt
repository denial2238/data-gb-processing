The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between inflammation and vitamin D in hospital ized patients with IBD . Methods and Study Design : All the participants were recruited from one teaching hospital from June 2018 to October 2022.Inflammation was evaluated by serum concentration of C -reactive protein (CRP), using an immunoturbidimetric method at admission.We further divided the participants into five groups based on serum CRP levels: <5 , 5–9.9, 10 –19.9, 20 –39.9, and >40mg/L.Serum 25 -hydroxy -vitamin D (25 -(OH) -D) was assessed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.Additional information, including age, sex, body mass in- dex (BMI), IBD (ulcerative colitis vs.Crohn’s disease) subtype, was abstracted from medical records .Results: This study included 1,989 patients with IBD (average age was 39.4 years, 33.8% of them were women, 1 ,365 CD and 624 UC patients).
The median CRP was 5.49 mg/L (range of quartiles: 1.64~19.5 mg/L) and the prevalence of 25 -(OH) -D deficiency was 69.8%. CRP was significantly associated with serum level of 25 -(OH) -D.The dif- ference in 25 -(OH) -D was -4.28 ng/ml ( -5.27 ng/ml, -3.31 ng/ml) between two extremist CRP groups after ad- justment of potential covariates (age, sex, BMI, type of IBD, dietary type, season, and lymphocyte c ount).Sub- group analysis in sex, type of IBD, and age , were similar to the main analysis results .Conclusions: There was a negative association between CRP levels and vitamin D in hospitalized patients with IBD .
Key Words: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), C -reactive protein (CRP), inflammation, vitamin D INTRODUCTION Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two condi- tions (Ulcerative colitis, UC and Crohn’s disease, CD) that are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gas- trointestinal tract.1 C-reactive protein (CRP) is a bi- omarker reflecting systemic inflammation, and has been evaluated as a useful marker of IBD activity.2 Boirivant et al.
reported that among patients with CD, elevated CRP levels in the previous year was associated with an in- creased risk of recurrence in the second year compared to that in patients with normal CRP levels.3 In a study of 200 Norwegian patients with IBD who were followed for 5 years and the results showed that CRP response was stronger in patients with CD compared to patients with UC, CRP levels increased with the severity of patients with UC at diagnosis.4 IBD could result in abnormalities of both absorption and utilization of micronutrients, including vitamin D.5-7 Previous studies found that the deficiency of vitamin D was prevalence among patients diagnosed with IBD.
Low vitamin D, caused by mal -absorption, inadequate dietary intake, and insufficient sunlight exposure,8.9 would in- crease the risk of IBD.7,8,10,11 Pharmacological interven- tions, including corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs could also interfere with vitamin D metabolism and absorption, thereby exacerbating the deficiency.6 In addi- tion, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 -(OH) -D] as the active form of vitamin D, is negatively associated with disease activity, regardless of IBD type.12 Moreover, a longitudi- nal study demonstrated that low vitamin D was associated with a high incidence and disease severity in IBD.13 Sup- plementation with vitamin D has been demonstrated to improve disease activity, quality of life in patients, and Correspond ing Author : Dr Renying Xu, Department of Clini- cal Nutrition, Ren Ji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai China Tel: +86-021-68383335 Email: 721001735@shsmu.edu.cn Manuscript received 18 March 2024.

Revision accepted 16 May 2024.doi: 10.6133/apjcn.202409_33(3).0007 CRP and vitamin D in IBD 371 reduce likelihood of IBD -related complications.7 A meta - analysis indicated that supplementation with vitamin D considerably reduced the risk of recurrence in patients with CD.14 Another randomized placebo -controlled trial also proved that daily supplementation of 1200 IU vita- min D could reduce the risk of relapse in 94 patients with CD.15 The connection between inflammation and vitamin D remains unclear.
A cross -sectional study showed that CRP is one of the useful markers of IBD activity, was inversely associated with serum vitamin D.2 However, the association was evaluated by correlation without consid- eration of potential confounding.16,17 An observational study reported a inversely correlation between serum 25 - (OH) -D levels and CRP.18 One study reported that from mild to moderate to severe inflammation, vitamin D con- centration decreased significantly with the increase of CRP concentration.19 Another two studies reported that CRP in UC patients was associated with vitamin D, but not in CD patients20,21 while the reverse scenario was found in Germany study.22 Studies performed in Italy23 and Switzerland24 reported CRP was associated with vit- amin D by multivariate analysis. However, sample size was small in all above -mentioned studies.
Therefore, we performed the current retrospective study to evaluate the association between inflammation and serum vitamin D levels among 1,989 hospitalized patients with IBD. Inflammation was evaluated by serum level of CRP.We postulated that the increase of CRP level could result in low level of vitamin D .METHODS Study participants All participants in the current study were hospitalized for treatment of IBD who were recruited from Ren Ji Hospi-tal, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, from June 2018 to October 2022.In this study, none of the IBD patients used vitamin D dietary supplements.We performed a sequential recruitment as following: Patients with liver disease (n=30), kidney disease (n=18) and can- cer (n=24) were excluded.We further excluded individu- als with missing (n=634), and those who aged less than 18 years (n=3).Finally, 1,989 adult patients (1,365 cases of CD and 624 cases of UC) with active IBD were in- cluded in the study (Figure 1).
The protocol (No. LY - 2022 -057-B) of this study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Ren Ji Hospital , Shanghai Jiao Tong Uni- versity School of Medicine.As a retrospective study, pa- tients’ written consent was waived by the same Ethical Committee.Serum level of CRP All measurements in this study were performed in the clinical laboratory of the Ren Ji Hospital.After fasting for at least 8 h, venous blood samples were drawn in the morning and transfused into a vacuum tube containing EDTA.Serum concentration of CRP was measured using an immunoturbidimetric method (PA990 analyzer, Lifo- tronic Technology, Shenzhen, China).The minimum de- tectable concentration of CRP was 0.5 mg/L, and the dif- ference between the two groups was 12.5%.
All partici- pants were further divided into five groups by CRP lev- els: <5, 5 –9.9, 10 –19.9, 20 –39.9, and >40 mg/L.25 Serum 25 -(OH) -D, calcium and phosphate In this study, serum 25 -(OH) -D was the primary outcome while serum level of calcium and phosphorus were sec- ondary outcome. The serum 25 -(OH) -D was determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods and serum concentrations of 25 -(OH) -D below Figure 1.Flowchart of sample recruitment 372 F Song, J Lu, Z Chen, Y Zhou, Z Cao and R Xu 20ng/ml was defined as low vitamin D level.26 And we also recorded the collection date of serum 25 -(OH) -D samples.Serum level of phosphorus and calcium were assessed by chemiluminescent immunoassay method.
To avoid the effect of hypoalbuminemia on serum level of calcium, albumin -corrected calcium was applied for fur- ther analysis, which was calculated as the following equa- tion: serum total calcium (mmol/L) + 08 x [40 -serum albumin(g/L)].27, 28 Low level of serum calcium and phos- phorus were defined as <2.1 mmol/L and <0.81 mmol/L was defined as low level of calcium and phosphorus, re- spectively. Other information Blood samples were prepared according to the above methods.Alanine transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutamyltransferase (GGT), and total bilirubin (TBIL), were assayed by enzyme -linked immunosorbent method.The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated from the Chronic Kidney Disease Epide- miology Collaboration (CKD -EPI) equation.All the bio- chemical markers were measured at admission of IBD patients.Body weight and height were measured by trained nurses upon admission.
BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by the square of height (m2). Age, sex, primary diagnosis, and the history of chronic disease, diet intake, and surgery were abstracted from medical records.Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SAS (ver- sion 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).The chi - square test was performed to compare the type of IBD in the different CRP groups.Body mass index (BMI), liver and kidney function, and the plasma calcium, 25 -(OH) -D, and phosphorus levels were compared using a Kruskal - Wallis analysis of variance and pairwise Mann -Whitney U test.The least square means (LSMs) and their standard for the different CRP group were calculated; subgroups of IBD type were also analyzed (Supplementary Table 1).We screened for risk factors using a one -way analysis of variance before performing multivariate linear regression.
Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted in all participants and subgroups using covariables (age, sex, BMI, type of IBD (CD vs. UC), dietary type, season and lymphocyte count) adjusted for covariates to explore whether there were differences in plasma calcium, 25 - (OH) -D, and phosphorus concentrations across CRP groups.Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between CRP concen- trations and risk of low levels of calcium (<2.2mmol/L),29 phosphorus (<1.1mmol/L),30 and 25 -(OH) -D (<20ng/ml) 26 (Supplementary Table 2).Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between CRP concentration and risk of low calcium were calculated using multivari- ate logistic regression analysis.To test the robustness of main analysis, we performed four subgroup analysis in different sex (men vs.women), IBD type (UC vs.CD), age (<45y vs.
≥45 y), and in different body weight status (low body weight vs. normal body weight vs.over- weight).Consider that serum vitamin D fluctuated in dif-ferent seasons31, we further performed a sensitivity anal- ysis in different seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter) (Supplementary Table 3).A two -tailed and statis- tical significance was set at p-value <0.05 .RESULTS In this study the mean age of the patients with IBD was 39.4±14.3 years, 33.8% of them were women, and the median CRP was 5.49 mg/L (interquartile range: 1.64- 19.5 mg/L).Age, sex, and IBD type differed significantly among the CRP groups.Compared to the group with the lowest CRP concentrations, BMI, TBIL, calcium, and 25 - (OH) -D levels were significantly lower in the highest CRP group (all p<0.001).In contrast, ALP, GGT, eGFR and LYC were significantly increased in the highest CRP group (all p<0.001).
And with the increase of CRP, the days in hospital of patients with IBD were also increased (p<0.001) (details were shown in Table 1). Most patients with IBD follow a semi -liquid diet type during their hos- pital stay (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 4).The association between CRP and 25 -(OH) -D are listed in Table 2.After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, type of IBD, dietary type, season and lymphocyte count, CRP was significantly associated wi th serum level of 25 -(OH) - D (Table 2, model 2).The difference in 25 -(OH) -D was - 4.28 ng/ml (95% CI: -5.27 ng/ml, -3.31 ng/ml) between two extremist CRP groups (<5mg/L vs.≥40 mg/L).Simi- larly, CRP was shown to be associated with the risk of low 25 -(OH) -D.The adjusted odd ratio was 10.72 (95% CI: 6.84, 16.81) in CRP level ≥40 mg/L group patients, compared with low level of CRP (<5mg/L) group (Sup- plementary Table 2).
CRP was also associated with serum level of calcium but not with serum level of phosphorus (Supplementary Table 4, model 2). The results of subgroup analysis are shown in Table 3.The correlation between CRP and 25 -(OH) -D was strong- er in patients with CD, in older patients ( ≥45 y), and in patients with overweight (BMI ≥24 kg/m2), compared to their counterparts.The association was similar in women with that in men.In addition, the highest CRP group (CRP ≥40 mg/L) was showed significant negative associ- ation with 25 -(OH) -D in different seasons (spring, sum- mer, autumn and winter) ( p<0.001) .DISCU SSION Our study analyzed the data on inpatients with IBD from a single central hospital and found that CRP was associat- ed with serum 25 -(OH) -D and calcium, but not phospho- rus.The strengthen of this study had a large sample size and adjusted for potential confounding factors including age, sex, BMI, type of IBD, dietary type, season, and lymphocyte count.
Vitamin D belongs to a fat -soluble steroid hormone that has immunoregulatory functions in patients with IBD.32 A higher incidence of vitamin D deficiency has been observed in IBD patients compared to the general population,33,34 with high rates of deficiency ranging from 22% to 63%.35 This is similar to our result, the prevalence of 25 -(OH) -D deficiency was 69.8% in this study (Sup- plementary Table 5). However, in one study including 60 patients with IBD, 95% of whom were confirmed have CRP and vitamin D in IBD 373 Table 1.

Vitamin D deficiency depends on a variety of factors, such as study location and season of measurement.37 We analyzed serum 25 -(OH) -D sam- ples collected from patients with IBD in this study by different seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter), it showed that 25 -(OH) -D collected in summer were signif- icantly higher than in other three seasons (Supplementary Table 3). This may be related to the amount of sunlight exposure that IBD patients get in the summer, however it still s howed low levels of 25 -(OH) -D (<20ng/ml).Other- wise, in a cohort of 79,719 individuals in the Nurses' Health Study, women with the highest vitamin D had a significantly lower risk of developing CD.34 Older adults were diagnosed with IBD is a clinical predictor of lower vitamin D.Vitamin D deficiency has been found in both CD and UC.37 Similar results were found in our sub- group analysis of age (<45y vs.≥45 y) and IBD type (UC vs.CD).
These results may be influenced by seasonal variations in vitamin D leve ls, meanwhile, may be associ- ated with elevated CRP concentrations, chronic disease, differences in baseline CRP levels, gender, age, and sup- plemental dose of vitamin D.38 Several studies have reported the results on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on CRP levels.
The cohort study of Framingham Offspring showed that no signifi- cant relationship between vitamin D and CRP (n=1,381).39 A recent meta -analysis using randomized controlled trials reported that vitamin D therapy had a favorable effect on marker inflammation.40 In a meta - analysis study that included 10 randomized controlled trials, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on CRP was analyzed, and the results showed that vitamin D sup- plementation can significantly reduce CRP levels by 1.08 mg/L.41 However, most current studies have focused on the effects of vitamin D on CRP, and conversely, there are few results on the effects of CRP on vitamin D. Our findings indicate that participants with elevated CRP ex- hibit significantly lower vitamin D levels compared to those with lower CRP.In addition, Bellia, et al.
reported that CRP levels in 147 morbidly obese patients ranged from 1.88 -4.01 mg/L, and supplementation of vitamin D for one year in overweight and obese participants resulted in a decrease in serum IL -6 concentration and a signifi- cant increase in serum CRP concentration.42 Meanwhile, one study showed that high BMI was positively associat- ed with vitamin D deficiency.43 There may be a correla- tion between inflammation, BMI, and vitamin D, which is supported by our results. In the subgroup analysis, our results showed that overweight IBD patients with high levels of CRP showed a more pronounced negative asso- ciation with vitamin D.We also found that older ( ≥45 years) or overweight IBD patients had higher CRP levels and a more pronounced association with vitamin D.Ngo et al.studied 253 adults aged 51 to 77 years with an aver- age CRP level of 3.6±4.0 mg/mL and a significant nega- tive correlation between serum vitamin D and CRP lev- els,44 which was sim ilar to our result.
The mechanism between inflammation and vitamin D might be multifac- torial, including the changes in metabolism related en- zymes, intestinal calcium absorption and urinary calcium excretion.19 Furthermore, inflammation can influence the production and availability of vitamin D -binding protein (DBP). Hence, our findings also need to be re -examined in larger randomized controlled trials designed specifical- ly to investigate the association between inflammation levels and vitamin D in the future.Our study also found that IBD patients with high CRP concentrations showed lower plasma calcium levels, which has rarely been reported.Individuals with IBD often experience diarrhea, which can further affect nutri- ent absorption and lead to malnutrition.
A meta -analysis Graphical abstract CRP and vitamin D in IBD 377 of 19 studies has reported inadequate calcium intake in all adults with IBD.45 Low plasma vitamin D concentrations in IBD patients might be one possible reason for plasma calcium. Meanwhile, it may also be related to the type of diet of the patients, many patients maintain a semi -liquid diet during the hospital stay.Chronic malnutrition can lead to reduced immunity and increased inflammation.Increasing age is related to decreased immunity and in- creased inflammation, which is why people over 45 years of age in our study showed a higher correlation coeffi- cient than those under 45 years of age.Therefore, more attention should be paid to inflammation levels and mi- cronutrient status in low -weight older populations.Our study also had some limitations.First, the cross - sectional study design made it impossible to establish casual association between inflammation and vitamin D.
Further, the data was from single center, and thus the generalizability is limited. Second, the information of extent or localization of patients with IBD were not col- lected in the analysis.This information will be collected in future prospective studies.Third, antibiotics and ster- oids, which were reported to be closely associated with CRP 6 were deficient.A well -designed prospective study is needed to duplicate our results.Conclusion CRP was associated with vitamin D and calcium in hospi- talized patients with IBD.Micronutrient concentrations of patients, especially vitamin D and calcium should be rou- tinely tested in IBD patients with high CRP .ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are grateful to subjects who participated in this study .AUTHOR DISCL OSURE S The authors declare no conflict of interest .REFERENCES 1.Hanauer SB.Inflammatory bowel disease: epidemiology, pathogenesis, and therapeutic opportunities.Inflamm Bowel Dis.2006; 12: S3 -9.doi: 10.1097/01.mib.0000195385.19268.68.2.
