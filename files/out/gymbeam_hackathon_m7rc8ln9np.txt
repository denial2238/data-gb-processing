Compared to CB chickens, the WB chick-ens had a larger ﬂoor size as well as lower stocking den- sity, atmospheric ammonia, and nipple-shared chickencounts.The results demonstrated signi ﬁcantly higher pH,L *-andb*-value , and lower shear force in CB com- pared to WB during cold storage.Using1H NMR analy- sis, 25 compounds were identi ﬁed in the chicken breast meat.Partial least square-discriminant analysis ( PLS-DA) was performed based on the identi ﬁed metabolites.
The content of 15 metabolites (1 di-peptide, 9 free amino acids, 2 glycolytic potential-related products, 2 nucleo- tide-related products, and 1 organic acid) was signi ﬁ- cantly different due to the rearing environment (CB vs.WB). Among them, all free amino acids were higher inCB than in WB.Six free amino acids (glycine, isoleucine,leucine, phenylalanine, valine, and b-alanine) had vari- able importance in projection ( VIP ) score >1, regard- less of the number of cold storage days.Therefore, these compounds in the breast meat may be used as potential markers to determine the rearing environment ofbroilers.Also, this result might be an indication ofstress-related meat quality changes in broilers.
Key words: chicken breast meat, animal welfare, meat quality, metabolomic analysis 2022 Poultry Science 101:101953 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2022.101953 INTRODUCTION Chicken breast meat is recognized as a healthy food source with an excellent nutrient composition ( da Silva et al., 2017 ). It is high in protein content and low in cho- lesterol and fat content, as well as low in calories(Kim et al., 2020 ).Therefore, in terms of nutrition, it is more attractive to the modern health-conscious con- sumer ( Petracci et al., 2014 ).With the increasing trend in wellness-oriented consumerism, the consumption ofchicken breast meat has increased along with the con-sumers ’interest in improving meat quality such as tex- ture, ﬂavor, juiciness, appearance, health, organic, and safety ( Henchion et al., 2014 ).
The consumer ’s requestfor animal welfare during the meat production process has raised the question as to whether animal-friendlyrearing has an impact on the meat quality ( Enf€alt et al., 1997;Lin et al., 2014 ;da Silva et al., 2017 ). During rearing, chickens can be exposed to various environmental factors (e.g., equipment and facilities, stocking density, and air quality), inducing different lev- els of stress ( Muroya et al., 2020 ).In particular, broilers reared on high stocking density are exposed to heat stressand increased atmospheric ammonia with increased bodytemperature, resulting in a decrease in immunity andantioxidant defense system with increased reactive oxy-gen species ( An et al., 2012 ).In the Republic of Korea, a certiﬁcation system for animal welfare farms has been implemented since 2014 for broilers ( MAFRA, 2012 ).
Animal welfare farms can be approved if they have ananimal-friendly breeding environment (e.g., stockingdensity, ammonia concentration, feeders, waterers, plantsource, etc.) following the standards set by the Ministryof Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs ( MAFRA, 2012 ; Kim et al., 2020 ). Several studies have been reported /C2112022 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.This is an open access article under the CCBY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/ 4.0/).Received September 8, 2021.Accepted May 2, 2022.1Corresponding author: cheorun@snu.ac.kr 1 lower physiological stress levels in broilers reared on ani- mal welfare farms approved in the Republic of Korea compared to conventional farms ( Kim et al., 2021c ,d).Stress can change the ﬁnal chicken meat quality because stress-induced effects result in changes in the metabolicfunctions and biochemistry in postmortem muscles(Xing et al., 2019 ;Muroya et al., 2020 ).
Many studies have been conducted to analyze the changes in the meatquality in different rearing environments controlled by various environmental factors (air quality, density, graz- ing, temperature, etc.), and the meat quality may differdepending on the environmental factors ( Zhang et al., 2012;Kim et al., 2020 ;da Rosa et al., 2021 ). In fact, it has been con ﬁrmed in several studies that chicken meat quality is improved when broilers are reared in animal-friendly conditions ( Castellini et al., 2002 ;da Silva et al., 2017;Kim et al., 2020 ).Meanwhile, it is still unclear how pre-slaughter environmental stressors affect chicken meat quality during extended storage period.The meatquality can be also changed during storage due to micro-bial growth, protein degradation, and lipid oxidation(Nychas et al., 2008 ;Jung et al., 2010 ;Fu et al., 2015 ; Wen et al., 2020 ).
Metabolomics is a rapidly developing ﬁeld in meat sci- ence and involves the analysis of small compounds (<1,500 Da) to explain changes in meat quality charac- teristics under various physiological and environmentalconditions ( Wen et al., 2020 ).Kim et al. (2021a) reported the differences in chicken breast meat metabolitesobtained from different strains and lines, using one-dimensional and two-dimensional quantitative nuclearmagnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy and separated them using multivariate analysis.The metabolomic anal- ysis can be an effective approach to understand the changes in chicken breast meat quality under differentrearing conditions and cold storage ( Muroya et al., 2020 ).In the present study, we implemented metabolomic anal-ysis to compare the quality difference between breastmeat from broilers reared in conventional ( CB) and wel- fare farms ( WB) over a 7-d cold storage period.
This study provides the valuable basic data for explaining the changes in the metabolite pro ﬁles of chicken breast meat based on different rearing environment and extendedstorage effects. Furthermore, we suggest differences inmeat quality based on major metabolites that distinguishWB from CB for consumers who prefer to purchasechicken breast reared in animal-friendly environments.MATERIALS AND METHODS Preslaughter Conditions and Meat Sampling One-day-old 76,000 Cobb chicks (mixed in male and female) were reared in conventional or legally approvedanimal welfare farm for 35 d, respectively ( Table 1 ).The atmospheric ammonia concentration was measured andmonitored in real-time throughout the 35-d rearingperiod using ammonia meters (MiniMAX XP, Honey- well, Morristown, NJ) in both farms.All chicks were fed with crumble feed during the starter and grower periods,and pellet feed in the ﬁnisher period, following the ani- mal welfare approved farm standards ( MAFRA, 2012 ).
The WB group was provided a non-animal-derived dietand other substances (perch, sawdust, rice straw, andplant sources) to meet physiological and pecking needs.For both groups, dietary metabolizable energy in the starter (0 −7 d), grower (8 −19 d), and ﬁnisher periods (20−35 d) was 3,090, 3,180, and 3,250 kcal/kg, respec- tively, and the crude protein values of each diet were22.50, 20.20, and 19.20%, respectively. After 35 d of rearing, the chickens were transported for 90 min to the slaughterhouse and held in a lairage for4 to 6 h.Water was provided ad-libitum, and the fastingtime were 5 h.The chickens were stunned using 63 to 80% CO 2gas and slaughtered in strict accordance with Livestock Products Sanitary Control Act, Republic ofKorea, and carcasses from CB (n = 20) and WB(n = 20) were randomly selected and purchased from acommercial slaughterhouse (Iksan, Korea).All effortswere made to minimize the suffering of the animals.
Sub-sequently, the samples were transferred to a laboratory(Chuncheon, Korea) using a cooler with ice. Both sides of breast ﬁllet ( M.pectoralis major ) were obtained, placed on a polystyrene tray and wrapped in low-densitypolyethylene (oxygen transmission rate = 35,273 cm /C03 m/C02day/C01at p (O 2) = 1 atm).The chicken breast sam- ples were stored for 7 d in a walk-in cooler at 4 §1°C and analyzed after 1, 3, 5, and 7 d of storage.The leftside breast muscle was used to measure color, cookingloss, and shear force.The right side breast was prepared by pooled after grinding and then taken to analyze other meat quality traits and metabolomics.Samples wereanalyzed immediately on each storage day (1, 3, 5 and 7d) or stored at /C070°C until analysis.Physicochemical Traits pH Measurements The pH of the meat samples was measured using a pH meter (Orion 230A, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Inc., Waltham, MA) on all designated storage days (1, 3, 5, and 7 d).
Brie ﬂy, 10 g of sample and 90 mL of distilled water were homogenized (PolyTron PT-2500E, Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland), and the pH valueof the homogenate was measured after calibration withstandard buffers (4.01, 7.00, and 9.21).Color After removing the skin, meat color was mea- sured on the skin side of each breast ﬁllet was measured using a colorimeter CR-400 instrument (Minolta Co.,Table 1.

The colorimeter was calibrated using white plate references (Y = 84.6, x = 0.3174, y = 0.3241). Water-Holding Capacity and Cooking Loss The water-holding capacity ( WHC ) was calculated using the method described by Jang et al.(2011) .Brie ﬂy, the breast sample (0.5 g), with connective tissue removed, was heated in a water bath (80°C, 20 min) and cooled toroom temperature for 10 min.After centrifugation at2,000 /C2gfor 20 min, water loss was measured.The WHC (%) was calculated using the water loss by centri-fugation and moisture content.For cooking loss analysis, left side breast meat was placed in a polyethylene bag and cooked in a water bath (75°C, 45 min) until the core temperature reached over 73§2°C according to Kim et al.(2021e) .The cooking loss of the samples was expressed as the percentage ofweight loss before and after heating.
The cooking losswas measured on all designated storage days.Shear Force After cooking until the internal tempera- ture reached 73 §2°C, the samples were cut into 3 /C21 /C22c m 3(width /C2depth /C2height), and the shear force was analyzed using a TA1 texture analyzer (Lloyd Instruments, Fareham, UK) with a V blade (60° V-notch). The analyzer settings were as follows: 500 Nload cell, 50 mm/min test speed, 50 mm/min triggerspeed, and 0.1 N trigger force.Storage Stability Microbial Growth For determining microbial growth, the analysis was conducted on each storage day (1, 3, 5,and 7 d).The total counts of aerobic bacteria and coli-forms were measured using 3M Petri ﬁlm (Aerobic Count Plates, Coliform/ E.coli count plates, 3M, Saint Paul, MN).The breast sample (10 g) was placed in a sterilebag with 90 mL of saline and homogenized for 1 minusing a stomacher (BagMixer 400 P, Interscience, France).
After serial dilution of the homogenate, 1 mL of dilution was plated on the 3M petri ﬁlm and incubated for 48 h at 37°C. After incubation, the results wereexpressed as log CFU/g.Lipid Oxidation and Volatile Basic Nitrogen Value Tagged- PLipid oxidation (2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive sub- stance [ TBARS ]) and Volatile Basic Nitrogen ( VBN ) values were analyzed to evaluate quality deterioration during storage ( Lin and Lin, 2005 ).All analyses were conducted according to the methods described byShin et al.(2021) .Brie ﬂy, the TBARS value was deter- mined by homogenizing 5 g of each sample with 15 mLof deionized distilled water and 7.2% butylated hydroxyltoluene.The homogenized mixture (1 mL) was trans-ferred to new test tubes, and 2 mL of 20 mM 2-thiobarbi-turic acid in 15% trichloroacetic acid was added.The tubes were heated in a water bath for 15 min at 90°C, cooled, and centrifuged at 2,000 £gfor 10 min.
Theabsorbance of the supernatant was determined using a spectrophotometer (M2e, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 531 nm. The TBARS value was expressed as mgmalondialdehyde/kg breast meat as follows: TBARS ðmg MDA =kgÞ¼ absorbance of sampleð /C0absorbance of blank sample Þ/C2 5:58 The VBN value was determined by homogenizing 10 g of each sample with 50 mL of distilled water usinga magnetic stirrer for 30 min.The homogenate was ﬁl- tered through ﬁlter paper (Whatman No.1, Whatman PLC., Kent, UK), and 1 mL of the ﬁltrate was added to the outer chamber of a Conway micro-diffusion cell.Then, 1 mL of 0.01 N H 2SO4was placed in the inner cell, and saturated K 2CO 3(1 mL) was added to the other outer cell.The cell was sealed immediately and incubated at 25°C for 1 h.Subsequently, 10 mL of the Brunswick reagent was placed in the inner section andtitrated with 0.01 N NaOH.
The VBN values wererecorded as mg %.1D 1H NMR-Based Metabolites Polar metabolite extraction and 1D1H NMR analysis were performed according to the method described by Kim et al. (2019) .Brieﬂy, chicken breast samples were collected within 30 minutes at each storage day (1, 3, 5, and 7 d).Thechicken breast sample (5 g) was extracted with 20 mL of0.6 M perchloric acid.Then, the homogenate was centri-fuged (Continent 512R, Hanil Co., Ltd., Daejeon,Korea) at 3,500 £gfor 20 min, and the supernatant was titrated to pH 7.0, using KOH.Subsequently, eachextract was ﬁltered using ﬁlter paper (Whatman No.1, Whatman PLC.) and freeze-dried.The lyophilized sam- ple was diluted in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)using deuterium oxide containing 1 mM 3-(trimethyl-silyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid and used for NMR analy-sis.1H NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker 850 MHz cryo-NMR spectrometer (Bruker BiospinGmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany).
All spectra were ana-lyzed using Topspin 4.0.8 (Bruker Biospin GmbH), and each peak was identi ﬁed using Chenomx NMR suite 7.1 (Chenomx, Inc., Edmonton, AB, Canada) and HumanMetabolome Database ( www.hmdb.ca ). Statistical Analysis All analyses for chicken breasts with different breed- ing environments were conducted in ﬁve replicates for each of 1, 3, 5, and 7 refrigerated storage days.Theresults of physicochemical traits and storage stability were evaluated with ANOVA, and signi ﬁcant differences between the mean values were veri ﬁed using Tukey ’s multiple test in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)with a signi ﬁcance level of P<0.05.For quanti ﬁcation results of metabolite analysis, the effects of differentrearing conditions of the farm during cold storage oneach metabolite were estimated using two-way ANOVA,and the identi ﬁed metabolites were used to perform the partial least squares-discriminant analysis ( PLS-DA ) for multivariate analysis using MetaboAnalyst 4.0.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Physicochemical Traits Stress conditions have shown to affect the muscle pH, which in turn affects the overall meat quality(Zaboli et al., 2019 ).Table 2 shows the physicochemical traits of CB and WB in chilled storage for 1, 3, 5, and 7d.The pH of WB was signi ﬁcantly lower than that of CB, except on d 7.The lower pH of WB may be attrib- uted to the high glycogen content due to less stressunder WB conditions ( Ponte et al., 2008 ).Castellini et al.(2002) reported that the signi ﬁcantly lower pH in the meat of less stressed, organic broilers,compared to indoor-reared broilers, may be due tohigher glycogen levels being stored in the organicbroilers at slaughter, thereby inducing a further drop in the pH.Meanwhile, the pH of both CB and WB increased over the 7 d of cold storage ( P<0.05).
The increased pH value of chicken breast meat may be asso-ciated with the generation of nitrogenous base com-pounds by microbial spoilage ( Triki et al., 2018 ). Meat color, which can be in ﬂuenced by several physi- cal and chemical factors, is an essential quality parame-ter that affects consumers ’perceptions and selection of raw meat ( Karunanayaka et al., 2016 ;Faustman and Suman, 2017 ).In the current study, the L *value of CB was higher than that of WB after d 3 ( P<0.05).A rapid pH drop that is usually affected by pre-slaughter stressgives rise to a pale meat color ( Barbut, 1993 ; Karunanayaka et al., 2016 ); however, our study showed conﬂicting results, which may be due to stress-inducedmuscle proteolysis in CB.As it is well reported, in stress- ful environments, muscle protein breakdown is acceler- ated due to secreting corticosterone ( Zhang et al., 2012 ; Ma et al., 2021 ).
This muscle proteolysis can generate the low-molecular weight peptides and amino acids,which increases light scattering and re ﬂection of muscle by changing the refractive index ( Hughes et al., 2014 ). Therefore, the higher L *value in CB may be due to increasing light re ﬂection and change of muscle struc- ture by stressful rearing condition.During the 7 d of cold storage, the b*value of CB was signi ﬁcantly higher than that of WB, whereas the a*value showed a similar level.The possible reason for the higher b*value in the breast meat from more stressed broilers is unclear, butpresumably, it might be due to oxidative stress damagedbiological macromolecules, such as proteins, lipids, andDNA ( Zhang et al., 2011 ).Therefore, further studies that analyze the correlation between meat yellowness and oxidative damaged biological macromoleculesshould be conducted.
Generally, yellow meat color isconsidered unpleasant because consumers believe thatyellowish tissues originate from old, undernourished, orunhealthy animals ( Troy and Kerry, 2010 ). The chicken breast meat from less stressed conditions (WB) is likelyto be preferred by consumers due to the desirable meat color of WB.In terms of change in storage period, no dif- ference between the L *and a*values of between the chicken breasts from the two environments was observedon most storage days, whereas the b *value increased as the storage period progressed.According to Marcinkow- ska-Lesiak et al.(2016) , the alteration of meat pigment, particularly due to the generation of metmyoglobin,leads to an increase in b *value during cold storage.This may be one of the reasons that underpins the increasing b*values of CB and WB during longer storage time.Table 2.Physicochemical traits of chicken breast meat from conventional and animal welfare farms during cold storage.

Meat tenderness is an important quality attribute that affects the meat palatability, and the shear forcevalue is one of the most representative instrumental methods to measure it ( Dodge and Stadelman, 1960 ). In this study, the shear force value of WB was higher thanthat of CB during all cold-storage times ( P<0.05; Table 2 ).In general, stress leads to a soft texture owing to a rapid pH drop ( Kim et al., 2014 ); however, in this study, the stressful rearing environments had a greatereffect than pH on the meat tenderness.CB broilers wereexposed to a more stressful rearing condition and accel- erated muscle proteolysis, resulting in increased meat tenderness.The shear force is negatively correlated withthe proteolysis level of the myo ﬁbrillar protein, which is induced by several stressors ( Zhang et al., 2012 ;Marcin- kowska-Lesiak et al., 2016 ).
Therefore, the higher shear force value in WB was due to the low protein breakdownof the broiler that is induced by less stress ( Kim et al., 2020). Meanwhile, the shear force values of CB and WB decreased with increased cold storage time ( P<0.05).The tenderness increased during postmortem aging inchilling conditions by enzymatic degradation of themyoﬁbrillar structural proteins ( Fu et al., 2015 ).In summary, most of the quality characteristics (pH, L *- and b*-value , and shear force) were affected by stress-inducing conditions during rearing, and CB andWB showed signi ﬁcantly different results.Similarly, an increase in cold storage days in ﬂuenced some physico- chemical attributes (pH, b *value , cooking loss, and shear force) of both CB and WB.Among the physico-chemical traits, only the L *value showed an interaction between main effects (farm condition and storage day;Table S2 ).
Furthermore, the physicochemical traits, except for cooking loss and WHC, remained constantwith an increase in storage days. This suggests that consumers may not observe the changes in chicken breast until 7 d when stored under proper refrigerationconditions.Storage Stability The storage stabilities of CB and WB showed similar results throughout the storage period.In the case of total aerobic bacteria, no signi ﬁcant difference was found between CB and WB during the storage period(Table 3 ), and the bacterial populations in both CB and WB increased with an increase in the storage period ( P <0.05).This supports the reason for the changes in pH during storage.Sallam and Samejima (2004) observed that aerobic plate counts of chicken breast muscle grad-ually increased during 12 d of chilled storage time with an increase in the pH.E.coli coliforms were not detected in all samples and storage days in the present study(data not shown).
TBARS and VBN are good indicators of lipid oxida- tion and spoilage, respectively ( Lee et al., 2018 ). In the present study, the TBARS and VBN values of chickenbreast gradually increased with increasing storage time(P<0.05), whereas there was no signi ﬁcant difference between CB and WB ( Table 3 ).In our preliminary study, no signi ﬁcant differences were found in the anti- oxidant activity of between CB and WB from the resultsof the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavengingactivity, 2,2 ’-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sul- fonic acid radical scavenging activity, ferric reducingantioxidant power, and oxygen radical absorptioncapacity ( Table S3 ).The low-fat content and heme pig- ment in chicken breast may contribute to minor changes in TBARS of CB and WB ( Min et al., 2008 ; Peiretti et al., 2011 ).Considering the results from storage stability, similar properties were observed between CB and WB in termsof quality deterioration during cold storage.
The breastmeat from both CB and WB lost storage stability duringstorage, resulting in a gradual deterioration in meat quality. Metabolomic Analysis on Meat Quality Multivariate Analysis PLS-DA was used to visualize the discrimination between CB and WB for each storageday ( Figure 1 ).The chicken breast meat samples from the two different rearing conditions were clearly distin-guished from each other on all storage days.From these results, it can be inferred that rearing systems can affect metabolic changes in chickens.Consequently, CB andTable 3.Storage stability of chicken breast meats from conven- tional and animal welfare farms during cold storage.

If the compounds can be identi ﬁed, which are inﬂuenced by the metabolic changes in chickens with dif- ferent rearing environments, they can be used as poten- tial biomarkers for differentiation. For example,Tian et al.(2015) reported that 13 metabolites related to carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism arelikely to be potential biomarkers for diagnosing heatstress status in dairy cows.Further details about themetabolites that were ascribed to different stress levelsfrom rearing environments are discussed the section below.Metabolite Differences Between Farm Conditions Tag- gedPUsing 1H NMR analysis, 25 metabolites were quantita- tively identi ﬁed in CB and WB during cold storage for 7d(Table 4 ).
Among them, 15 compounds (acetate, ala- nine, anserine, glucose, glutamate, glycine, isoleucine,lactate, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, uridine mono- phosphate, uracil, valine, and b-alanine) were signi ﬁ- cantly different between CB and WB with a largeproportion of free amino acids. In addition, the variableimportance in projection ( VIP ) score was calculated, which expresses the importance of the variables for thediscrimination of groups in PLS-DA.Metabolites withVIP scores higher than 1.0 were considered to be themajor contributors to the formation of the PLS-DA model ( Kim et al., 2021b ).In our study, the VIP scores were calculated to evaluate the importance of individualmetabolites in separating CB and WB in PLS-DA andhow they changed during 7 d of refrigerated storage.As Figure 1.Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of the breast meat from broilers that were reared conventional (CB) and animal welfare farms (WB) after each cold-storage day.
(A) d 1; (B) d 3; (C) d 5; (D) d 7.6 JUNG ET AL. a result, the metabolites with a VIP score higher than 1.0 differed slightly among storage days, and these dif-ferences seem to induce distinction in meat qualitybetween CB and WB.Six metabolites, namely glycine,isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, valine, and b-alanine,were identi ﬁed with a VIP score >1.0 on all storage days (Table 5 ), which may play a key role in the formation of the PLS-DA model regardless of the change in storageperiod.As discussed above, these 6 free amino acids pro-duced via higher protein degradation levels in CB than WB ( P<0.05) on all refrigerated storage days caused differences in quality properties such as higher L *value and lower shear force in CB ( Figure 2 ,Table 4 ).When a chicken is under stress, the absorption of energy sub-stances decreases and body energy expenditureincreases, leading to insuf ﬁcient energy supply (Ma et al., 2021 ).
The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is then activated to increase the concentration of circulating corticosterone hormone, which increases the rate of conversion from meat protein to amino acid bysuppressing protein synthesis and promoting proteinbreakdown ( Sapolsky et al., 2000 ;Zhang et al., 2012 ). In our study, the content of most free amino acids (alanine,glutamate, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine,tyrosine, valine, and b-alanine) was signi ﬁcantly higher in CB than in WB.Considering that CB was exposed to a more stressful rearing environment, more proteolysis might have occurred in CB than in WB.Among them,some compounds (alanine, glutamate, glycine, isoleu-cine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and valine) are glucogenicamino acids involved in glucose production(Newsholme et al., 2011 ).
Hence, these 7 free amino acids might be stored in higher levels in the skeletal mus-cle to be used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis in CB than WB, which is related to a more stressed environ- ment ( Mayes and Rodwell, 2003 ). Furthermore, in a stressful situation, the amino group of branched-chainamino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine),Table 4.NMR-based metabolites (mg/100 g) of chicken breast meats from conventional and animal welfare farms and cold storage.

It can then produce alanine through a transamination reaction with pyruvate, which is pro- duced through metabolic pathways such as glycogenoly-sis and glycolysis in muscle. Subsequently, alanine canbe transferred to the liver through the blood and beregenerated into glucose, using the carbon backbone left by the deamination reaction ( DeFronzo and Felig, 1980 ).After glucose is transferred through the blood to the muscle, it can be utilized to produce energy.Hence, it is believed that more branched-chain amino acids (isoleu-cine, leucine, and valine) and alanine were accumulatedin CB muscle than in WB to increase glucose supply.Figure 2.Heatmap for variable importance in projection (VIP) scores of the identi ﬁed metabolites in breast meat from broilers that were reared conventional (CB) and animal welfare farms (WB) during cold storage.The compounds enclosed in a dotted-square had a VIP score >1.0 through- out the cold-storage period.8 JUNG ET AL.
This result corresponds with that in which the glucose content was signi ﬁcantly lower in CB. The glucose and lactate contents were signi ﬁcantly higher in WB than in CB.This result was attributed toWB reared in a relatively less stressful condition thanCB ( Castellini et al., 2002 ).As we con ﬁrmed above, this result supports that of pH, which was lower in WB because the broilers raised on welfare farms accumulated higher levels of glycogen before slaughter.Both glucoseand lactate had VIP scores >1 only on the initial storage days.Likewise, the pH value corresponds to lactate, andthere was also a difference in pH between CB and WB inthe early stage of storage.However, the lactate contentof CB and WB gradually decreased; eventually, therewas no signi ﬁcant difference in pH due to the rearing effect on d 7.Therefore, it is inferred that lactate on the initial storage day was linked to the gap in pH valuesbetween CB and WB.
Recent research has found thatglucose and lactate, which are glycolytic metabolites,are highly positively correlated with the concentrationof anserine in chicken muscle ( Baldi et al., 2021 ). These authors explained that anserine in chicken muscle actsas an endogenous buffer, preventing a rapid drop in pH postmortem.In the current study, the anserine content was higher in WB, which had higher concentrations ofglycolytic metabolites (glucose and lactate) than CB ( P <0.0001).In addition, anserine is a histidine dipeptide that is abundant in non-mammalian skeletal muscles,such as poultry, and is a well-known bioactive com-pound with therapeutic activity ( Jung et al., 2013 ).It is also related to umami ﬂavor ( Dashdorj et al., 2015 ).Consistent with our ﬁndings, Kim et al.
(2020) reported that anserine content was higher in breast meat fromanimal welfare farm than that from conventional farm.In summary, WB, presumably less exposed to a stressfulenvironment than CB, stored more anserine and glyco-lytic metabolites in breast muscle. The effect of animal-friendly rearing on meat quality and metabolites is summarized in Figure 3 when com- pared with conventional rearing systems.In the WB broiler, the reduced stress levels resulted in decreasedmuscle proteolysis, leading to a decrease in the contentof several metabolites, mainly free amino acids.Thesemetabolic changes in WB resulted in decreased L *and b*values and increased shear force.
Thus, the 6 metabo- lites (glycine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, valine,andb-alanine) with signi ﬁcantly different concentration and a VIP score >1 between CB and WB can be regarded as potential indicators that separate the ani-mal-friendly reared broilers from the conventional ones.Metabolite Differences During Refrigerated Storage Overall, the free amino acid (alanine, aspartic acid, glu-tamate, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyro-sine, and valine), acetic acid, hypoxanthine, and inosinecontents were signi ﬁcantly increased, whereas those of glucose, inosine-5 ’-monophosphate ( IMP ), NAD +, and uridine monophosphate ( UMP ) were decreased in both CB and WB with increase in the number of storage days (P<0.05, Table 4 ). Fresh meat can be spoiled by prote- olysis and microbial growth during refrigeration, andvarious peptides and free amino acids are produced byprotein degradation ( Triki et al., 2018 ).
Moreover, acetic acid can be produced during meat fermentation by lacticacid bacteria, and glucose can be utilized by microorgan-isms in chicken meat for their growth ( Shukla et al., 2015;Mansur et al., 2019 ). Therefore, the concentra- tions of these metabolites in CB and WB were closelyrelated to microbial growth and were affected by chilledstorage, among which free amino acids and acetateincreased and glucose decreased ( P<0.05).The content of some nucleotide-related products (hypoxanthine, IMP, inosine, and UMP) in chickenbreast was also affected by refrigerated storage.As enzy- matic reaction occurs after slaughter, IMP breaks down, with the simultaneous accumulation of inosine andhypoxanthine in fresh meat ( Kim et al., 2021b ).Simi- larly, UMP can also be decomposed into nucleosides andnucleobases by the catalytic reaction of 5 ’-nucleotidase during cold storage ( Dong et al., 2020 ).
Previous studies have reported that these nucleotide-related compoundsmay be used to estimate meat freshness ( Parris et al., 1983;Zhang et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it is suggested that the contents of the four nucleotide-related compoundswere signi ﬁcantly affected by the change in cold storage day due to the degradation of metabolites by enzymaticactivation in CB and WB.NAD +is a cofactor that participates in oxidation-reduc- tion reactions.It is known to r egulate various metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and fatty acid oxidation ( Xie et al., 2020 ).Based on our results, it is inferred that the decrease in NAD+in chicken breast dur- ing cold storage is due to postmortem glycolysis, as twoNAD +molecules are consumed to generate one glucose, which is further converted to pyruvate ( Cant /C19o et al., 2015 ).CONCLUSIONS This study aimed to investigate the effect of an ani- mal-friendly rearing system on the breast meat quality Figure 3.
Overview of the changes that occurred in the broilers breast meat under animal welfare farms (WB) rearing condition.DIFFERENCES OF METABOLITES BY REARING EFFECT 9 and metabolomic pro ﬁle of broilers in aerobic cold stor- age. The metabolism of chicken breast is affected by rearing systems exposed to different levels of stress.CBand WB showed different metabolite features; particu-larly, the content of free amino acids was signi ﬁcantly higher in CB.In this regard, it is considered that themetabolite pro ﬁles of CB and WB were majorly affected by the muscle proteolysis due to different stress levels.The differences in some physicochemical characteristics of CB and WB were signi ﬁcantly affected by differences in their metabolomic pro ﬁles.In the present study, 6 free amino acids (glycine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leu-cine, valine, and b-alanine) could be recognized as candi- dates for indicators to distinguish animal-friendly rearedchickens from conventional ones.
Furthermore, futurestudies on serum metabolites would be helpful in broad-ening the library of potential markers that have an impact on more metabolic pathways affected by rearing conditions.
