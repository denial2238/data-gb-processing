Pyridoxal 5-phosphate ( 10,P L P ,v i t a m i nB 6) is an essential cofactor in all living systems where it plays a central role in the stabilisation of carbanions adjacent to amines primarily in amino acidmetabolism. 1An enzyme complex consisting of Pdx1 and Pdx2 catalyses the conversion of glutamine, ribose 5-phosphate(R5P) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) to PLP.2,3Protein structures show two conserved phosphate binding sites in Pdx1, spaced 22 Å apart.4–6During catalysis, the r ibose phosphate group occupies the P1 phosphate binding site,5,7–9while the product PLP phosphate group binds in P2.9,10The Pdx1-associated glutaminase Pdx2 generates ammonia,2,3which diffuses through an internal channel towards the Pdx1 P1 site4where it then reacts with the covalent R5P adduct.This most intriguing catalytic step leads to formation of the double imine chromophoric intermediate I 320 (Fig.1).
In this communication we study the Arabidopsis Pdx1 enzyme; the plant has three pdx1 alleles,2,11of which we studiedPdx1.3. Lys98 of Pdx1.3 was previously shown to form an imine withthe R5P aldehyde, 9,12enabling a series of sugar modifications in the ribose tailoring site that culminate in the addition of Lys166 togenerate I 3209,12(8).The Lys98/Lys166 crosslinking intermediate forms after phosphate elimination;13however, the detailed mecha- nism is not understood.The vacated P1 site can then be occupied bythe phosphate of the second substrate G3P, defining dual specificity for the Pdx1 active site.9Incorporation of G3P leads to formation of PLP13–16that is proposed to migrate to the PLP/P2 product site.9Our previous study trapped an intermediate prior to phosphate elimina- tion in the Lys166Arg exchange variant of the Pdx1.1 paralog (5LNT,see ESI †), suggested to form from R5P modification with ammonia.
9We now constructed the lysine/arginine exchange var- iant in the Pdx1.3 enzyme where structures of several other inter-mediates are available (reviewed in ESI †). 9,12We characterised the intermediate that formed after addition of R5P and ammonia inthis variant.For its characteristic absorbance we named the adductI 333, determined its mass and demonstrated ammonia incorpora- tion.The crystallographic structur e suggests key catalytic residues for I 333formation, allowing us to propose a mechanism for depro- tonation and phosphate elimination.The data rationalise howsubsequent imine formation gives I 320.We used UV-vis absorption spectroscopy to characterise adducts formed by Pdx1.3 and its Pdx1.3K166Rvariant.R5P and (NH 4)2SO4were added to Pdx1.3 (10 mM and 200 mM final concentrations respectively) leading to accumulation ofthe chromophoric I 320intermediate over an hour at RT ( 8, lmax= 314 nm).
Further addition of G3P (20 mM final concen- tration) leads to the formation of PLP in Pdx1.3 ( lmax= 412 nm, Fig. 2).Pdx1.3K166Rdid not catalyse formation of the I 320 intermediate (compare14); instead yielding a product with lmax= 333 nm (Fig.2).Addition of G3P to the I 333complex did not lead to any significant changes in spectral signaturesdemonstrating that Pdx1.3 K166R:I333does not convert to PLP.We therefore conclude that Lys166 is required for I 320for- mation, consistent with recent structural proposals,9,12and that I 320is a required intermediate for PLP biosynthesis.aBiological Sciences, Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.

After tryptic digestion, the peptide mixtures were analysed by LC-ESI-TOF-MS. Comparison of the predicted and observed mass for the substrate free samples demonstrated that both Pdx1.3 andPdx1.3 K166Rcontained QAVTIPVMAK 98, unmodified at lysine 98 ([M + H]+= 1057.6 Da, Table 1 and Fig.S1, S2, ESI †).Addition of R5P to both samples leads to a mass diﬀerence of 212 Da, as seen in the samples of Pdx1.3 + R5P (Table 1 and Fig.S3, ESI †)a n d Pdx1.3K166R+ R5P (Table 1 and Fig.S4, ESI †).For Pdx1.3K166R,t h e e x t r a1 6D ao nt h eP d x 1 .
3K166Rpeptide relative to Pdx1.3 is consistent with the oxidation of Met96 to its sulfoxide, which can occur during sample preparation.17The observation of the 212 Da adduct ( 1) is consistent with earlier observations.3,15From previous structural and MS analysis, it is known that I 320is formed after the addition of R5P and ammonia14,16and crosslinks Lys98 and Lys166.9,12In the present study, instead of trapping I 320,t r e a t m e n t of Pdx1.3 with R5P and ammonia followed by trypsin gave unmo-dified QAVTIPVMAK and TK 166GEAGTGNIIEAVR with a mass a d d u c to f9 6D a( T a b l e1a n dF i g .S 5 ,E S I †), consistent with elimination of Lys98 from the I 320adduct to give ( 9). In the key experiment, treatment of Pdx1.3K166Rwith R5P and ammonia followed by trypsin gave the I 333modified QAVTIPVMAK 98peptide with a mass adduct of 194 Da (Table 1 and Fig.S6, ESI †).
The Pdx1.3K166RTR166GEAGTGNIIEAVR peptide was not modified, demonstrating that it was not attached to I 333.O nt h e Bacillus subtilis Pdx1K149Rvariant (equivalent to Pdx1.3K166R) a 12-fold lowerformation of I 320was reported,14but the observation may indeed reflect formation of I 333in the bacterial enzyme. The I 333adduct was further investigated by crystallographic analysis.‡Equivalent to our earlier study of the I 320 intermediate,9we soaked Pdx1.3K166Rcrystals with R5P and (NH 4)2SO4where we used this protocol to generate the Pdx1.1K166R:preI 320complex (5LNT, see ESI †).UV-vis spectra were taken in crystallo18to confirm formation of I 333(Fig.3a) and corrected for scattering at the crystal-solvent/air interface (see ESI, †18,19).The observed absorbance at lmax= 333 nm was consistent with the in-solution da ta (Fig.2).The crystal structure shows I 333as an adduct ( 6) between lysine 98 and C1 from R5P (Fig.3b).
Since the spectra indicated ammonia incorporation, the intermediate has been modelled with nitrogen in place of theoxygen at C2. This is consistent with previous NMR data showingthat nitrogen incorporation precedes formation of the I 320 intermediate,15and is also consistent with the mass spectrometry analysis presented here (Table 1).Fig.2 UV-vis absorption spectra showing the formation of the I 320and I333intermediates in solution at RT.Blue dashed line, addition of R5P, ammonia and G3P to Pdx1.3 results in the formation of the chromophoric intermediate I 320(lmax= 315 nm) and PLP ( lmax= 412 nm).Yellow line, addition of the same compounds to Pdx1.3K166Rresults in the formation of intermediate I 333(lmax= 333 nm) that does not convert to PLP after addition of G3P.The peak at lmaxB280 nm represents protein.The discontinuity at 360 nm is caused by changeover of deuterium and halogen lamps.

The I 320intermediate formed bridges the catalytic Lys98 and Lys166 side chains. Addition of glyceraldehyde 5-phosphate (G3P) leads to conversion of I 320to pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP).Communication RSC Chemical Biology © 2022 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry RSC Chem.Biol., 2022, 3, 227–230 | 229The novel crystal structure and mass-spectrometry data lead to a revised mechanistic proposal for the formation of I 320 based on detection and characterisation of I 333, as shown in Fig.4.R5P forms an imine with Lys98, which then undergoes a tautomerisation to give 1.Imine formation with ammonia gives 2, which tautomerises to 3.Elimination of water, assisted by acid catalysis by Asp41 gives 4.The crystal structure is particularly helpful for interpretation of catalytic steps required in I 333formation (Fig.S8, ESI †).
The base catalyst for the tautomerisation of 4to5is a conservedwater molecule bound by hydrogen bonding to the amide NH ofGly230 and Val232 ( b7a7 loop), the carbonyl oxygen of Phe250 (b8a8 loop) and the closest substrate phosphate oxygen, shown in Fig. 5.The active site bears a structure similar to a proteaseoxyanion hole.20Interactions with the amide NH of Gly252, Ser253 ( b8a8 loop), Gly231 ( b7a7 loop) and Gly170 ( b6a6 loop) stabilise the negatively charged R5P phosphate, which itselfpolarises a water molecule activating it as a base in substrate-assisted catalysis; phosphate groups are frequently observed toperform such function.21The specific structure ensures stereo- specificity of the C5 proS deprotonation reaction.13Tautomer- isation of 5to6is assisted by proton transfer from Asp41.In the native enzyme, a conjugate addition of Lys166 is proposed to 6to give 7, where the substrate phosphate and the conserved water serve as catalytic base.
Elimination of phos-phate from carbanion 7completes formation of I 320, which is converted to 9by elimination of Lys 98 in the presence of G3P to yield PLP, as previously described.9,15 Conclusions Our data are consistent with I 333being on-pathway and serving a function in substrate-assisted catalysis during phosphateelimination. The active site structure allows rationalisingstereoselective loss of the C5 hydrogen of R5P.The structureof I 333elucidates the catalytic mechanism for the formation of the novel lysine crosslinking intermediate I 320and is central to our understanding of the Pdx1-catalysed PLP biosynthesis.9,12 Fig.3 In crystallo18UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and structure of Pdx1.3K166R:I333.(a) UV-vis spectra normalised for the absorption maxima of the chromophores, collected from crystals of Pdx1.3:I 320(blue dashed line) and Pdx1.3K166R:I333(orange line) after soaking with R5P and ammo- nia.
