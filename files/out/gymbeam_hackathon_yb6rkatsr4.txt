The results showed that WS could be distinguished from normal controls by E-nose, and four volatile compounds (o-xylene, benzene, 1,3-dimethyl, 2-heptanone and 6-methyl and Acetic acidand ethyl ester) were detected as decreased compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Lipidomic analysis showed that WS breast ﬁllets featured increased neutral lipid (83.8%) and decreased phospholipid molecules (33.2%).Targeted metabolomic analysis indicated that 16 hydrophilic metabolites were altered.Thereinto, some water-soluble ﬂavor precursors, such as adenosine monophosphate, GDP-fucose and L-arginine increased signi ﬁcantly, but fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and L-histidine signi ﬁcantly decreased in the WS group.These results provided a systematic evaluation of the ﬂavor precursors pro ﬁle in the WS meat of broiler chickens.
KEYWORDS broiler chickens, white striping, lipidomics, metabolomics, ﬂavor precursors 1 Introduction Chicken, especially the breast muscle, is widely regard as an important source of high quality protein with low lipid content ( Marangoni et al., 2015 ). Modern broilers have been intensively selected for an accelerated growth rate and increased breast yield.Consequently, growth-related breast muscle abnormalities have been reported successively in recent years.
Studies have shown that factors in ﬂuencing the incidence of the WS symptom are breastOPEN ACCESS EDITED BY Xiquan Zhang, South China Agricultural University,China REVIEWED BY Yuwares Malila,National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC), Thailand Genxi Zhang,Yangzhou University, China *CORRESPONDENCE Jie Wen, wenjie@caas.cn Ranran Liu, liuranran@caas.cn †These authors have contributed equally to this work SPECIALTY SECTION This article was submitted to AvianPhysiology, a section of the journal Frontiers in Physiology RECEIVED 25 October 2022 ACCEPTED 13 December 2022 PUBLISHED 18 January 2023 CITATION Kong F, Bai L, He Z, Sun J, Tan X, Zhao D,Feng F, Liu D, Zhao G, Wen J and Liu R(2023), Integrated metabolomics andlipidomics evaluate the alterations ofﬂavor precursors in chicken breast muscle with white striping symptom.

WS incidence has varied from 12% up to 98% in broilers ( Kuttappan et al., 2012a ; Petracci et al., 2013 ;Tijare et al., 2016 ;Kuttappan et al., 2017 ; Malila et al., 2018 ;Golzar Adabi and Demirok Soncu, 2019 ). According to the degree of WS partitioning, the affected breasts were divided into normal, moderate, severe, or extreme (Kuttappan et al., 2016 ).De carvalho et al.(2020) showed that the occurrence of moderate WS (9.6% –92.5%) was always well above severe WS (0.0% –2.5%), which was consistent with a report byGolzar Adabi and Demirok Soncu, (2019) .Breast ﬁllets with severe scores are not suitable for fresh retails due to an unacceptable appearance, but breasts with a moderate score are common in the supermarket.Thus, moderate WS deserves furtherstudy in the respect of ﬂavor quality.
In general, the disadvantages of WS meat quality include the appearance, nutritional value and processing characteristics(water holding capacity) ( Kuttappan et al., 2012b ;Petracci et al., 2013 ;Baldi et al., 2018 ). Moderate WS does not have a signiﬁcant impact on cook loss, marinade uptake and Meullenet- Owens razor shear energy ( Tijare et al., 2016 ) and texture attributes (such as juiciness, rate of breakdown, chewiness,cohesiveness and hardness) ( Sanchez Brambila et al., 2016 ).Therefore, moderate WS with minor changes in appearance has few effects on meat quality.It is well-known that intramuscular fat (IMF), composed of triacylglycerols (TGs), phospholipids, etc., is an important factor to increase meat quality ( Cui et al., 2012 ;Jiang et al., 2017 ;Qiu et al., 2017 ).A certain amount of IMF content can enhance ﬂavor, tenderness, water retention and the sensory quality of meat ( Suzuki et al., 2005 ;Zhao et al., 2007 ).
It was reported that phospholipids contribute signi ﬁcantly to pork and beef ﬂavor (Mottram 1998 ;Huang et al., 2010 ).Gandemer (2002) although TGs were also important for ﬂavor formation as TGs contributed 30% –50% of free fatty acids. WS was associated with a greater amount of lipids and moderate scored WS ﬁllets were also rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids ( Kuttappan et al., 2012a ;Golzar Adabi and Demirok Soncu, 2019 ).However, there are limited systematic evaluations of ﬂavor precursors in WS meat.In this study, integrated lipidomics and metabolomic analyses wereapplied to reveal volatile compounds, lipids and hydrophilic metabolite changes in WS meat.2 Materials and methods 2.1 Broiler husbandry and sample collection One hundred male Arbor Acres (AA) commercial broilers were raised in the Institute of Animal Sciences at the ChineseAcademy of Agricultural Sciences (IASCAAS, Beijing, China) experimental base.Broilers were fasted for 12 h and weighed individually at 42 d of age.
All the chickens were electrically stunned and slaughtered. The samples about 20 g of the rightbreast muscle from the cranial part were collected and stored at−80 °C.The samples were crushed and mixed after defrosted at 4°C, two portions of 6 g samples were weighed and used for E-nose and GC/MS test separately.The left part was deboned and stored for 3 h at 4°C before scoring.Five moderate WS breast ﬁllets and ﬁve normal samples selected were used for the E-nose and volatile compounds measurement.A total of 150 male fast-growing white feathered pure line B were raised by Xinguang Agricultural and Animal Industrial Co.,Ltd.(Mile, China).The chickens were fasted for 12 h and weighed individually at 42 d of age.The samples from the super ﬁcial layer of the cranial part of the right breast muscle were collected and stored at −80 °C for next step analyses.
Other procedures such as selection and slaughter of chickens, deboned left breast and WS scoring were the same as in the AA broilersﬂock. Five moderate WS breast ﬁllets and ﬁve normal samples selected were used for omics analysis.All chickens were raised individually in three-story step cages and the environmental conditions and nutritional compositions were same as recommended by the Feeding Standard of Chickensin China (NY 33-2004).The diets and water were available ad libitum .The guidelines established by the Ministry of Science and Technology (Beijing, China) was the reference standard of thisexperimental animals.All procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the Institute of Animal Sciences in the CAAS and the reference number was IAS 2019-44.2.2 Phenotype identi ﬁcation and sample selection The left breast ﬁllets of 100 AA commercial broilers and 150 pure line B chickens were scored.
Brie ﬂy, the score included normal breast score = 0, moderate WS score = 1 (narrow fat white lines, <1 mm wide), severe WS score = 2 (fat white lines 1 –2m m wide and visible on the surface) and extreme WS score = 3 (white bands >2 mm wide and covering the whole surface) ( Kuttappan et al., 2016 ). The compression test was introduced to identify ﬁllet with WB.The compression force of ﬁllets was measured as described by Sun et al.(2018) .Fillets were measured on cranial regions and compressed to 20% with a 6-mm ﬂat probe on a TA.XT Plus Texture Analyzer (Stable Micro Systems Ltd., Godalming, United Kingdom).The parameters were set as follows: trigger force was 5 g, probe height was 55 mm, pre-and post-probe speeds were 10 mm/s and the test probe speed was 5 mm/s.Each ﬁllet was tested three times at different regions of the ﬁllet.
The breast tissues of pure line B were used to estimate the triglyceride (TG) content commercial kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 02Kong et al. 10.3389/fphys.2022.1079667 Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).In brief, procedures were as follows: add 18 ml absolute ethyl alcohol solution in the tube with 2 g breast tissue and ground for 2 min with a tissue grinder, centrifuged at 2,500 rmp for 10 min at 4°C, then obtain the supernatant for TG determined.2.3 Electronic nose analysis Theﬁve moderate WS and ﬁve control samples from AA chickens were defrosted at 4°C, and 6.0 g of each sample were placed in sealed sample bottles, and the ratio of water to meat is 2: 1.Subsequently, the bottles were boiled at 100°C for a further 30 min ( Jin et al., 2021 ).The E-nose used in the experiment was a Heracles II moderate (Alpha MOS, Toulouse, France) based on fast gas chromatography (GC).
There are two ultrasensitive ﬂame ionization detectors ( μ-FIDs) and two capillary columns of different polarity including a non-polar MTX-5 (5% diphenyl) and a medium polarity MXT1701 (14% cyanopropyl-phenyl)dimensioning as 10 m × 0.18 mm × 0.4 μm. There are also an Odor Scanner HS 100 autosampler (Gerstel GmbH, Mülheim, Germany) equipped with the E-nose.All samples were incubated at 50 °C for 30 min and agitation at 500 rpm.The headspace phase (3,000 μL) was migrated to the injector and heated to 200°C.The parameters were as follows: initial temperature at 70°C for 29 s, then ramped at 2°C/s to 250°C for 34 s, and the detector temperature was at 270°C.The carrier gas was Hydrogen N5.0 (Linde Gaz, Krakow, Poland).2.4 Analysis of volatile compounds The same pre-treated were applied as those for the electronic nose analysis.
The solid-phase microextraction (SPME) arrows were directly migrated and desorbed in the injection port of the GC for 3 min on splitless mode after headspace extraction. GC-mass spectrometry (MS) (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, United States) with a TG-WAX capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μmﬁlm wide, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA, United States) were used for volatile compounds analysis.Firstly, the column temperature was kept at 40 °C for 2 min, then slowly increased to 230°C at a rate of 4°C/ min and ﬁnally kept at 230°C for 5 min.The mass spectrometer parameters were as follows: ion source temperature 280°C, interface temperature 250°C and electron ionization (EI) 70 eV; MS detection was full scan mode (mass range of 30- 400 m/z).Each chromatographic peak corresponded by each spectrogram was qualitatively determined according to thecomputer chart.
The mass spectra were compared with information from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Wiley libraries and the linear retentionindices (LRIs) was matched with the online database to conﬁrmed all the information ( http://www. ﬂavornet.org/https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ), then the volatile compounds were identi ﬁed.2.5 Lipidomics analysis Five controls and ﬁve moderate WS samples were selected in pure line B.The lipids were extracted as follows: added 650 μL chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) into 65 mg sample and homogenized by a super ﬁne homogenizer.The 150 μL water was added; samples were vortexed for 2 min and incubated for 10 min at 4°C, then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C.Transferred the lower chloroform layer into a new tube (1.5 ml,Eppendorf, Wesseling-Berzdorf, Germany) and aqueous washing was repeated twice again.
The extracts were dried in a Thermo Scienti ﬁc Savant Vac (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) for 1.5 h and dry pellets were stored at -80 °C. The pellet was dissolved and protein concentration was determined and normalized to the protein level for the later detection.Untargeted lipidomics test was carried out with the Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a UPLC system Ultimate 3,000 (Thermo Fisher).The UPLC system was coupled to a Q-Exactive HFX Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) which was furnished with a heated electrosprayionization (HESI) probe.Lipid extracts were obtained by a Cortecs C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm, Waters, Milford, MA, United States).A binary solvent system was utilized.Themobile phase A consisted of Acetonitrile (ACN): H2O (60:40), 10 mM ammonium acetate, and the mobile phase B included iso- propyl alcohol (IPA): ACN (90:10), 10 mM ammonium acetate.A 35-min gradient was applied with a ﬂow rate of 220 μL/min.
The sample tray and column chamber were preserved at 10 °C and 40°C, respectively. The data were obtained through data dependent acquisition by MS/MS.The mass spectrometer parameters were set as follows: a spray voltage of 3,200 V (positive) and 2,800 V(negative), an auxiliary gas ﬂow rate of 10 Arb units, a capillary temperature of 320 °C, an NCE of 15/30/45, a mass range (m/z) of 240 –2,000 (positive) and 200 –2,000 (negative), and a topN of 10.A full scan and fragment spectra were acquired with a resolution of 70,000 and 17,500, respectively.Lipid identi ﬁcation were carried out by LipidSearch software (Version 4.1.16; Thermo Fisher).The relative quanti ﬁcation of the identi ﬁed lipids were calculated from their relative peak areas.2.6 Metabolomics analysis Five controls and ﬁve moderate WS from pure line B were used for metabolite extraction and metabolomics analysis based on MS.Added HPLC-grade methanol (700 μL, 80% v/v) which was cooled at −80°C for 2 h to the sample (70 mg).
The mixture was ground in dry ice by a super ﬁne homogenizer, vortexed for Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 03Kong et al. 10.3389/fphys.2022.1079667 3 times (10 s per time) incubated at −80°C for 8 h and centrifuged at rmp 12.000 at 4°C for 20 min.The supernatant of the sample was diverted to a new tube (1.5 ml, Eppendorf) and concentratedby a Thermo Scienti ﬁc Savant Vac for 4 h to dryness.80% methanol was used for the redissolution of residues to furthur analyze.Targeted metabolomic analysis was implemented by TSQ Quantiva (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc).Reverse-phase chromatography (C18 column) was used with 10 mMtributylamine, 15 mM acetate in water as mobile A and 100% methanol as mobile phases B.The emphasis of this analysis was the TCA cycle, glycolysis pathway, amino acids, purinemetabolism and pentose phosphate pathway.In this experiment, we used a 25-min gradient from 5% to 90% as mobile B.Data acquisition form the positive-negative ionswitching mode.
The resolving power of Q1 and Q3 are both 0.7 FWHM. The source voltage positive-negative ion mode was 3,500 v and 2,500 v respectively.The source work conditionswere as follows: heater temperature, 300 °C; auxiliary gas ﬂow rate, 10; sheath gas ﬂow rate, 35; spray voltage, 3,000 v; capillary temperature, 320°C.Trace ﬁnder 3.2 (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc) with a home-built database was used for the metabolite identi ﬁcation.2.7 Statistical analysis The SPSS 25.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) was utilized.Statistical evaluation was carried out by the Student ’s two-tailedt-test.Data are displayed as means ± standard error.Statistical signiﬁcance was set as p<0.05.Principal component analysis (PCA) and pathway analysis were performed with MetaboAnalyst 5.0.Graphs were generated with GraphPadPrism 8.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).
3 Results 3.1 Phenotype identi ﬁcation and sample selection In the 100 AA chickens measured, there were eight (8%) moderate WS, six (6%) severe WS, 27 (27%) WB and 35 (35%) WB accompanied by WS were found. The compression force, the body weight and breast weight were similar between WS andcontrols ( Table 1 ).In the 150 pure line B chickens, there were 23 (15%) moderate WS, 43 (29%) WB and 25 (17%) WB accompanied by WS were found.The compression force and TG remarkably increased in the WS group, but the average body weight and breast weight were similar.The ﬁgures of WS breast with score 1 and controls are displayed in Figure 1A .The samples with severe WS or WB were excluded in the following test.3.2 Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in WS and normal breast ﬁllets Moderate WS samples were selected from AA broilers and measured using E-nose.The WS meat could be distinguishedwith discriminant factor analysis (DFA) ( Figure 1B ).
The changes of VOCs in WS ﬁllets were further measured by GC-MS. Overall, 101 VOCs from breast ﬁllets were identi ﬁed (Supplementary Table S1 ).These VOCs were classi ﬁed into seven categories: alcohols (8), aldehydes (27), ketones (16), esters (6), hydrocarbons (17), heterocyclic compounds (18) and othercompounds (9).Based on the PLS-DA score plot, there was some overlap between the control and moderate WS group (Figure 1C ).For hydrocarbons, the relative intensity of o-xylene and benzene, 1,3-dimethyl in WS signi ﬁcantly decreased ( Figure 1D ).Regarding ketones and esters, levels of 2-heptanone, 6-methyl and acetic acid and ethyl ester in the WSgroup were remarkably lower than in the controls ( Figure 1D ).There is no signi ﬁcant difference of the percentage of volatile categories between the control and moderate WS groups(Figure 1E ).
3.3 Lipidomic analysis of WS and normal breast ﬁllets There are 560 lipid molecules identi ﬁed form the positive and negative ion mode in breast ﬁllets of pure line B ( SupplementaryTABLE 1 The compression force, breast weight and body weight between the control and moderate WS groups in AA and pure line B chickens.* Category Control MOD WS P Commercial AA Chicken number 24 (24%) 8 (8%) - WS Score 0 1 - Compression force/(N) 2.45 ± 0.62 3.00 ± 0.47 p>0.05 Breast weight/(g) 207 ± 18 221 ± 18 p>0.05 Body weight/(g) 2157± 133 2127 ± 178 p>0.05 Pure line B Chicken number 59 (39%) 23 (15%) - WS Score 0 1 - Triglyceride (TG)/(mg/kg) 5.85 ± 0.91 14.70 ± 2.09*** 0.021 Compression force/(N) 2.57 ± 0.87 3.81 ± 0.41* p>0.05 Breast weight/(g) 241 ± 22 250 ± 38 p>0.05 Body weight/(g) 2531 ± 151 2565 ± 137 p>0.05 *The numbers of samples with severe WS or WB were not supplied here.

The lipid molecules with signi ﬁcantly differential abundance in WS are shown in Figure 2B andTable 2 . Compared with the control group, TGs increased in 90 categories whereas PCs in 52 categories and PEs in 38 categories decreased.In total, 29 categories of TGs increased 2.5-fold-6.2-fold as showninFigures 2C,D .Changes in PC and PE lipid molecules were lower than 66.7% of the controls ( Figure 2E ).The ranges of 10 PC categories decreased from 33.5% to 46.4% and 7 categories of PEschanged from 35.6% to 40.0%.As shown in Figure 2F , the relative level of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) was remarkably increased in the WS (45.48%) than in the controls (38.85%).Thelevel of SFAs and PUFA was signi ﬁcantly decreased in the WS (36.82%, 17.69%, respectively) than in the controls (41.77%, 19.38%, respectively).
3.4 Hydrophilic metabolites changed by WS symptom in breast according to targeted metabolomics A total of 98 compounds in breast ﬁllets in pure line B were determined ( Supplementary Table S4 ). An obvious separation between the WS samples and controls based on PLS-DA is showninFigure 3A .There were 16 hydrophilic metabolites signi ﬁcantly changed between the WS group and control.The signi ﬁcant metabolites are displayed in heat map analysis ( p<0.05; Figure 3B ).As shown in Figure 3D , 14 metabolites, including adenosine monophosphate (AMP)/2 ′-deoxyguanosine 5 ′- monophosphate (dGMP), GDP-fucose, xanthosine, L-arginine,and oxidized glutathione, increased in the WS group.Only fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and L-histidine signi ﬁcantly decreased in WS.
One pathway, glutathione metabolism, wasenriched ( p-value <0.05) using the 16 hydrophilic metabolites (Figure 3C ).4 Discussion Flavor composed of taste and aroma is an important sensory attribute in the ov erall acceptance of meat ( Wang et al., 2019 ). Aroma is a consequence of various VOCs that are produced by the complex biochemical changes of the inherent composition of the meat ( Shahidi et al., 1986 ;Khan et al., 2015 ), such as lipid oxidation, Str ecker, Maillard reactions and thiamine degradation ( Resconi et al., 2013 ).However, taste is due to non-volatile water-soluble compounds closely related to water-soluble precurso rs including carbohydrate compounds, peptides, nucle otides, free amino acids and other nitrogenous components ( Mottram and Edwards, 1983 ).In short, the formation of speci ﬁcm e a t ﬂavors can be achieved through different reactions among amino acids ofmeat hydrolysate and cysteine or methionine and glucose (Jayasena et al., 2013 ).
Therefore, any alteration of metabolite and lipid composition may cause changes in ﬂavor. The E-nose can analyze food objectively by the instrument of “smell ”(Shi et al., 2018 ).E-nose was able to detect changes in chicken meat owing to storage time and temperature accordingtoBoothe and Arnold (2002) .E-noses can also be used to distinguish the ﬂavor of different Chinese local high-quality chicken meat ( Jin et al., 2021 ).In this study, we found that moderate WS and control AA broiler samples could be distinguished by an E-nose.The volatile compounds were further detected by GC-MS in detail.Moderate WS breastcontained about 70% of the o-xylene, benzene, 1,3-dimethyl and 2-heptanone and 6-methyl found in the control group.Acetic acid and ethyl ester in moderate WS decreasedsigniﬁcantly to 48% of normal levels.
The four volatile compounds did not belong to the major volatile compounds found in chicken; 2-methyl-3-furanthiol is reported as the mostimportant compound in chicken ﬂavor and aldehyde is the major one in chicken meat ( Jin et al., 2021 ). In this study, there was no signiﬁcant difference in aldehyde content between WS and normal groups.This indicates that the major content of WS volatile compounds did not change in moderate WS meat.TABLE 2 The number of increased and decreased lipid molecules in different lipid categories of the WS group in the pure line B chickens.

Some studies have demonstrated that phospholipids, not TGs, contributed to the sensory aroma in beef (Mottram and Edwards, 1983). Ourﬁndings suggested a decreasing pattern in phospholipid ﬂavor precursors in the moderate WS breast ﬁllets.Phospholipids, mainly composed of PCs and PEs and the lipolysis PE, werethe main contributor to the increase of free fatty acids during the formation of meat ﬂavor of Nanjing dry-cured duck ( Xu et al., 2008 ).In this study, there are 38 PEs (28.6%) that were decreased signiﬁcantly and this may be related to the limited changing of VOCs found in the WS tested.The samples for VOCs and lipidomic measurements were from different chicken ﬂocks, which could also in ﬂuence the consistency of the results.The speciﬁc relationship between lipid changes and volatile ﬂavor substances needs further study.
In food, umami taste plays a important role in consumer satisfaction and it is derived from several non-volatilecompounds with regard to amino acids, predominantly glutamate and aspartic acid and 5 ′-nucleotides such as AMP, inosine-5 ′-monophosphate (IMP) and GMP ( Chen and Zhang, 2007 ). The water-soluble ﬂavor precursors make a important contribution to the umami taste (Mottram, 1998).IMP contributes to the taste of chicken meat ( Fujimura et al., 1996 ; Vani et al., 2006 ) and ribose, ribose-5-phosphate, glucose and glucose-6-phosphate are the main carbohydrates with ﬂavor- forming potential ( Meinert et al., 2009 ).In this study, AMP/ GMP, xanthosine and GDP-fucose increased signi ﬁcantly and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate decreased signi ﬁcantly in the WS meat.By One-dimensional 1H-NMR, previous research showed that malonate, taurine, threonine, and arginine were important metabolites for distinguishing normal breast from severe WS (Cônsolo et al., 2020 ).
The inconsistency results showed in two studies may be related to the different analysis methods and the sample conditions. A certain lysine to arginine ratio decreases cooking loss and increases the water holding capacity of porksausage ( Zheng et al., 2017 ).Histidine is the second largest contribution to taste activity value (TAV) in local chicken breast muscles ( Zhao et al., 2020 ).The increased arginine and decreased histidine of WS found in the current study may also affect the ﬁnal taste of the breast meat.Thus, changes in water- soluble metabolites may affect the ﬂavoring and substance composition of moderate WS meat.There are still some limitations in our study that volatile compounds and lipids were tested in different sample collections.
More studies arerequired to further explore the ﬂavor precursor alterations related to chicken white striping symptom.5 Conclusion GC-MS results showed that four volatile compounds, o-xylene, benzene, 1,3-dimethyl, 2-heptanone, 6-methyl andacetic acid, ethyl ester, were found to be decreased in WS meat. Lipidomic analysis showed that the WS meat featured increased neutral lipid, decreased phospholipid molecules.Targeted metabolomic analysis indicated that 16 hydrophilic metabolites we re altered in the WS meat.In the WS group, water-soluble ﬂavor precursors, such as L-arginine, AMP/dGMP, xa nthosine and GDP-fucose increased signi ﬁcantly but fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and L-histidine signi ﬁcantly decreased.Thes e results provided a systematic evaluation of the ﬂavor precursors in the WS meat of broiler chickens.
