ABSTRACT The World Health Organization recommends untargeted iron supple- mentation for women of reproductive age (WRA) in countries where anemia preva-lence is greater than 40%, such as Cambodia.Iron supplements, however, oftenhave poor bioavailability, so the majority remains unabsorbed in the colon.The guthouses many iron-dependent bacterial enteropathogens; thus, providing iron to indi-viduals may be more harmful than helpful.We examined the effects of two oral iron supplements with differing bioavailability on the gut microbiomes in Cambodian WRA.This study is a secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized controlledtrial of oral iron supplementation in Cambodian WRA.For 12 weeks, participantsreceived ferrous sulfate, ferrous bisglycinate, or placebo.Participants provided stoolsamples at baseline and 12 weeks.
A subset of stool samples ( n= 172), representing the three groups, were randomly selected for gut microbial analysis by 16S rRNAgene sequencing and targeted real-time PCR (qPCR). At baseline, 1% of women hadiron-de ﬁciency anemia.The most abundant gut phyla were Bacteroidota (45.7%) and Firmicutes (42.1%).Iron supplementation did not alter gut microbial diversity.Ferrous bisglycinate increased the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, and there was a trend towards an increase in the relative abundance of Escherichia- Shigella.qPCR detected an increase in the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) virulence gene, bfpA , in the group that received ferrous sulfate.Thus, iron supple- mentation did not affect overall gut bacterial diversity in predominantly iron-repleteCambodian WRA, however, evidence does suggest an increase in relative abundancewithin the broad family Enterobacteriaceae associated with ferrous bisglycinate use.
IMPORTANCE To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst published study to char- acterize the effects of oral iron supplementation on the gut microbiomes ofCambodian WRA. Our study found that iron supplementation with ferrous bisglyci-nate increases the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae , which is a family of bac- teria that includes many Gram-negative enteric pathogens like Salmonella ,Shigella , and Escherichia coli .Using qPCR for additional analysis, we were able to detect genes associated with enteropathogenic E.coli , a type of diarrheagenic E.coli known to be present around the world, including water systems in Cambodia.The current WHOguidelines recommend blanket (untargeted) iron supplementation for CambodianEditor Zhenjiang Zech Xu, 南昌大学 Ad Hoc Peer Reviewers Loo Wee Chia, Wageningen University and Research; Scott Daniel, University of Arizona Copyright © 2023 Finlayson-Trick et al.

Individuals with excess iron (due to conditions like hemochromatosis) are documentedto experience more severe bacterial infections (3 –5). Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies have observed a reduction in enteropathogen abundance when iron is limited(6, 7).Given these ﬁndings, there is ongoing concern that oral iron supplementation may increase the abundance of iron-dependent enteropathogens.The WHO recommends untargeted iron supplementation (30 to 60mg iron for 12 weeks) for women in countries where anemia prevalence is greater than 40%.This recommendation is based on the premise that most anemia is due to iron de ﬁciency, which is not always the case.Anemia has many etiologies, including in ﬂammation, infection, hemoglobinopathies, and other micronutrient de ﬁciencies.In Cambodia, for example, the most recent national Demographic and Health Survey found that 45% ofwomen were anemic, but only 3% were iron de ﬁcient (8).
Genetic hemoglobinopathies (e.g., hemoglobin E type or thalassemia) are prevalent in Cambodia and likely contrib-ute to a greater proportion of the anemia burden than iron de ﬁciency (9). Individuals with severe hemoglobinopathies are already at risk of iron overload due to alterationsin iron metabolism; thus, supplementing with iron has the potential to cause furtherharm (10).Due to poor bioavailability, iron absorption from oral supplements tends to be low.Simply increasing the dose of iron may not increase the amount absorbed and canlead to gut in ﬂammation causing common gastrointestinal side effects (11).Iron salts, such as ferrous fumarate or sulfate, are frequently used in supplements recommendedby the WHO (12, 13).An increasingly favored alternative is ferrous bisglycinate, a stableiron amino acid chelate that, compared to ferrous sulfate, has a two to three times bet-ter bioavailability and a more tolerable side effect pro ﬁle (14).
Most clinical trials in this area have focused on characterizing the gastrointestinal side effects associated withiron supplementation (15). Few studies have measured the effects of iron supplementson the gut microbiome and the results have been contradictory (16).In our study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine changes in the gut microbiome following 12 weeks of daily supplementation of either ferrous sulfate or ferrous bisglycinate in non-pregnant Cambodian women of reproductive age (WRA).We then used real-time PCR (qPCR) to assess the presence and abundance of bfpA and eae, virulence genes from enteropathogenic E.coli (EPEC), a common culprit of diar- rheal disease worldwide (17 –19).Due to the differences in bioavailability among the 2 iron interventions, we hypothesized that the women who received ferrous sulfatewould have an increased relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria compared tothose who received ferrous bisglycinate.RESULTS Participant characteristics.
In total, 172 Cambodian women were included in this study (Fig. 1).Baseline characteristics for those included did not signi ﬁcantly differ across trial arms for most reported variables (Table 1).The women had a mean 6 standard deviation (SD) age of 34 67 years, a mean 6SD body mass index of 23.563.8, and a median [interquartile range, IQR] number of children of 2 [1, 3].Among the women, 17% were anemic, de ﬁned as hemoglobin (Hb) ,120 g/L.Furthermore, after adjusting for the in ﬂuence of in ﬂammation, 4% of women were iron deﬁcient (de ﬁned by serum ferritin ,15 mg/L) and 1% had iron-de ﬁciency anemia (deﬁned as ferritin ,15mg/L and Hb ,120 g/L) (20).Women were de ﬁned as adherentEffects of Iron on Cambodian Women Gut Microbiomes Microbiology Spectrum May/June 2023 Volume 11 Issue 3 10.1128/spectrum.05273-22 2 if they consumed $80% of the capsules, which re ﬂected 62% of women in this study.
The one variable that differed between the trial arms was the proportion of women with animals living in the home (Fisher ’s exact, P= 0.037). Overall, phylum composition was comparable to other gut microbiome studies, with communities dominated byBacteroidota (Fig.S5) (mean 45.7%; SD 23.94%) and Firmicutes (mean 42.1%; SD20.8%).Other prominent phyla include Proteobacteria (mean 7.5%; SD 11.9%) andActinobacteriota (mean 4.0%; SD 1.4%).Gut microbial diversity in response to iron supplementation.The change in four different alpha diversity metrics between weeks 0 and 12 were examined for each trialarm, as depicted in Fig.2.After P-value correction, we found no signi ﬁcant differences in alpha diversity change between placebo and either trial arm.Like alpha diversity, wenext examined beta diversity and no trail arm showed a change in pairwise distancesbetween week 0 and week 12 that signi ﬁcantly differed from the placebo group (Fig.3).
Further visual examination through principal coordinate analysis plotting andPERMANOVA testing showed no interaction between the week and trial arm for weighted UniFrac (Fig. S6, P= 0.417, r 2= 0.005), unweighted UniFrac ( P= 0.905, r2= 0.004), or Bray-Curtis dissimilarity ( P= 0.16, r2= 0.005).However, a signi ﬁcant effect of sampling week (week 0 versus week 12) was found in both Bray-Curtis dissimilarity(P= 0.005, r 2= 0.006) and weighted UniFrac PERMANOVA testing ( P= 0.001, r2= 0.05) (Fig.S7).Gut microbiome differential abundance analysis.Using general linear models in ALDEx2, no genera were associated with the interaction between time and trial arm afterfalse discovery correction.Similar results were found using ANCOM-II and MaAsLin2.Incomparison, Corncob found three genera ( Enterococcus ,Weissella ,a n d Escherichia-Shigella ) associated with differences in trial arms.
Ferrous sulfate was associated with increases inthe relative abundance of Enterococcus and Weissella , while ferrous bisglycinate was associ- ated with increases in Weissella and Escherichia-Shigella (Fig. 4).Although these signi ﬁcant associations are driven by only a minority of samples.Due to the dif ﬁculty of FIG 1 Flow diagram outlining the allocation of Cambodian women to the different arms of the trial.A subset of stool samples ( n= 172) were randomly selected for microbial analysis using a computer- generated list ( n= 59 in the ferrous sulfate group; n= 55 for ferrous bisglycinate; n= 58 for placebo).
Samples were removed following 16S rRNA sequencing if their quality ﬁltered read depth was below 5000 reads (ferrous sulfate n= 40; ferrous bisglycinate n= 46; placebo n= 47).Effects of Iron on Cambodian Women Gut Microbiomes Microbiology Spectrum May/June 2023 Volume 11 Issue 3 10.1128/spectrum.05273-22 3 detecting many of the enteropathogens of interest at the genus level, we decided to further test for associations between iron supplementation and the relative abun- dance of Enterobacteriaceae using Corncob. This resulted in a small but signi ﬁcant increase in the relative abundance of this family in the ferrous bisglycinate groupcompared to the placebo group ( P= 0.026) (Fig.5).EPEC bfpA andeae.qPCR of EPEC genes bfpA and eaewere used to attempt to vali- date the ﬁndings stated above as changes in the relative abundance of Escherichia- Shigella showed the strongest relationship to iron supplementation.
Across the three trial arms, bfpA was detected in 9 to 11% of samples regardless of sample collection week (Table S1). Using mixed effects logistic regression to account for replicate sam- pling between weeks, a signi ﬁcant association was identi ﬁed between bfpA positivity and the interaction of endpoint sampling and ferrous sulfate trial arm when comparedto the placebo group (odds ratio 5.46 [ 1/22.13], P= 0.0104) (Table S1).The presence ofeaewas noted in the majority of samples, ranging between 77 and 85% of samples across trial arms, regardless of sample collection week.Mixed effects logistic regression showed no signi ﬁcant interaction between trial arm and sampling time.As a result of the high positivity rate of eae, further examination was warranted to assess whether there was an association between the estimated DNA quantity of eaeand trial arm.The change in estimated log eaeDNA quantity at week 0 and week 12 for each partici- pant was calculated using a standard curve.
No differences in the change of estimatedeaequantity were found between the different trial arms (Kruskal-Wallis P= 0.97) (Fig. S8).
Across trial arms, eaeand bfpA were detected in 1.8 to 5.4% of samples at baseline and 2.4 to 4.2% of samples at 12 weeks (Table S2).TABLE 1 Baseline characteristics of the 172 Cambodian women enrolled in the study divided by treatment arma Characteristics60 mg ferrous sulfate18 mg ferrous bisglycinate Placebo Total, n(%) 59 (34) 55 (32) 58 (34) Age, yrs 32.7 67.1 35.3 66.3 34.6 68.0 BMI (kg/m2) 22.9 63.1 24.1 64.1 23.6 64.2 Parity 2 [1, 3] 2 [2, 3] 2 [1, 3]Household Size 4.9 61.6 4.6 61.6 4.4 61.5 Health Centre Prey Kuy 20/57 (35) 19/57 (33) 18/57 (32) Srayov 25/64 (39) 21/64 (33) 18/64 (28) Tboung Krapeu 14/51 (28) 15/51 (29) 22/51 (43) Hemoglobin, g/L 128.9 611.9 127.9 614.0 129.2 610.4 Anemia (Hb ,120 g/L) 7 (12) 9 (16) 14 (24) Serum Ferritin, 1mg/L 68.3 (45.3, 104.4) 77.2 (40.0, 105.1) 62.5 (44.5, 104.1) Iron De ﬁciency (ferritin ,15mg/L)b2 (3) 2 (4) 3 (5) Iron De ﬁciency Anemia (Hb ,120 g/L and ferritin ,15mg/L)b1 (2) 0 (0) 1 (2) Adherence to supplementationc30 (51) 38 (69) 37 (64) Flush to septic tank household toilet 56 (95) 50 (91) 48 (83) Took antibiotics in last yr 30 (51) 18 (33) 33 (57) Water Source Hand Pump 27 (46) 30 (55) 28 (48)Ringwell 15 (25) 12 (22) 16 (28) Animal(s) living in the home 51 (86) 52 (95) 57 (98) Animal(s) living outside the home 36 (56) 35 (64) 36 (62) aValues are n(%), mean (SD) or median [IQR].

Nevertheless, Jaeggi and colleagues have previously observed a signi ﬁcant increase in Escherichia- Shigella in their population of 6-month-old Kenyan infants following four months of sup- plementation with iron-enriched micronutrient powder (2.5 mg/12.5 mg iron/day) (21). They also found that infants who received iron supplementation had signi ﬁcantly higher concentrations of pathogenic E.coli compared to infants who did not receive iron sup- plementation.Similarly, Zimmermann et al.(2010) observed a signi ﬁcant increase in Enterobacteriaceae among children from Côte d ’Ivoire who received iron-forti ﬁed biscuits (20 mg iron/day) for six months (22).In contrast, Dostal et al.(2014) did not observe a signiﬁcant effect on the gut microbiota in 6- to 11-year-old children living in South Africa following 38 weeks of iron supplementation (50 mg iron for 4 days/week) (23).
These results highlight that study context is critical as many factors, including hygiene, diet, and parasite burden, can affect gut microbial composition (24, 25). Furthermore, it is im- portant to note that infant and childhood microbiomes are considered to be less stable FIG 2 For each iron supplement trial arm, changes in richness, evenness, Faith ’s phylogenetic diversity (PD), and Shannon diversity were measured between weeks 0 and 12 and compared to the placebo group using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and a Holm-Bonferroni method with family-wise error rateP-value correction.No trail arm showed a change in alpha diversity that was signi ﬁcantly different than the others.Effects of Iron on Cambodian Women Gut Microbiomes Microbiology Spectrum May/June 2023 Volume 11 Issue 3 10.1128/spectrum.05273-22 5 and diverse than adult microbiomes (26).Therefore, our ﬁndings need to be con ﬁrmed in settings with other non-pregnant WRA.Diarrheagenic E.
coli (DEC) are found around the world, including in the waters of Cambodia. In a recent study of Tonle Sap Lake and its tributaries, researchers using qPCR found that 15.3% of E.coli isolates were DEC (27).Notably, in nearby ﬂoating vil- lages, DEC prevalence changed signi ﬁcantly by season, with a higher prevalence noted in low-water seasons (we will discuss pathogen seasonality further in the paragraph below).DEC includes six E.coli pathotypes that are organized based on microbiological and epidemiological characteristics.EPEC, one of the pathotypes, can be further classi- ﬁed based on the eaegene, located in the locus of enterocyte effacement, and bfpA gene, located on a plasmid called EPEC adherence factor.Typical EPEC strains contain FIG 4 Microbiome differential abundance tool CornCob identi ﬁed 3 genera ( Enterococcus ,Weissella , and Escherichia-Shigella ) that responded to iron supplementation.The ﬁgure shows average relative abundance.
Ferrous sulfate increased the relative abundance of Enterococcus and Weissella , while ferrous bisglycinate increased Weissella and Escherichia-Shigella . Colors were used to indicate direction of change with orange indicating no change (“constant ”), red indicating increase, and blue indicating decrease.FIG 3 Weighted UniFrac, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, and unweighted UniFrac were used for beta diversity analysis to identify any structural changes in th e gut microbiome of trial participants.There were no signi ﬁcant changes in the pairwise distances between weeks 0 and 12 for those who received ferrous bisglycinate ( n= 40), ferrous sulfate ( n= 46), and the placebo ( n= 47).Effects of Iron on Cambodian Women Gut Microbiomes Microbiology Spectrum May/June 2023 Volume 11 Issue 3 10.1128/spectrum.05273-22 6 eae and bfpA , whereas atypical EPEC strains contain eae, but are missing bpfA .Our qPCR results, which used primers speci ﬁc for E.
coli , suggest that the majority of our samples positive for eaewere atypical EPEC; however, it should be noted that entero- hemorrhagic E. coli can also contain eae(27).As we did not examine the other genes associated with enterohemorrhagic E.coli , we are unable to comment on the preva- lence of this DEC pathotype within our population.Nevertheless, several studies world-wide have documented the role of both typical and atypical EPEC in diarrheal disease,although typical EPEC generally has a stronger association with development of diar- rheal disease (28 –31).In the main trial population for this study, 53% of women (n= 254/480) reported experiencing gastrointestinal upset at least once a month at baseline, with 26% ( n= 67/254) of these women experiencing diarrhea (de ﬁned as three or more loose bowel movements in 24 h, citing data from a primary manuscriptunder review at the Journal of Nutrition ).
At 12 weeks, 17% ( n= 73/441) of women reported adverse side effects, of these, 7% ( n= 5/73) reported diarrhea. Cambodia is an equatorial country with a dry and rainy season that can be further categorized into pre- and post-monsoon seasons (32).Due to annual droughts andﬂooding, waterborne diarrheal diseases are a concern in Cambodia, especially in rural FIG 5 The relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae showed a small but signi ﬁcant increase following the 12-week trial with ferrous bisglycinate.Colors were used to indicate direction of change with red indicating increase and blue indicating decrease.Effects of Iron on Cambodian Women Gut Microbiomes Microbiology Spectrum May/June 2023 Volume 11 Issue 3 10.1128/spectrum.05273-22 7 regions (33).
Drought is thought to concentrate pathogens within remaining water sources and has globally been linked to increases in salmonellosis, shigellosis, and leptospirosis (34).Similar to the study out of Tonle Sap Lake, Poirot and colleagues observed higher concentra-tions of E. coli during the dry season in water sources collected from three Cambodian prov- inces (35).Our study occurred primarily during the dry season (January/February), and allstudy sites were located in rural Kampong Thom province.In addition to seasonality, this study must also consider the impact of COVID-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on March 11th, 2020.Cambodiarapidly implemented stringent measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 (36).Whileresearch continues to elucidate the direct and indirect in ﬂuence of COVID-19 on the gut microbiome, it is understood that gut microbial richness is a balance between mi-crobial acquisition and loss (37).
Many public health measures have indirectly pre-vented acquisition (e.g., limited contact between people) and promoted loss (e.g.,hand hygiene) of gut microbial species (38). The implementation of public healthguidelines, which occurred after baseline collection and before 12-week collection, may aid in explaining why the placebo group also experienced a similar change in gut microbial diversity over the 12 week trial (Fig.3).We have identi ﬁed three limitations of our study.Firstly, stool does not necessarily accurately represent the composition and metagenomic function of mucosa-associ-ated microbiota (39).In order to document this population of microbes, we wouldneed to perform colonoscopies, which are not feasible for large studies.As such, untilthe advent of new sampling methods, such as swallowable devices, it will remainunclear how mucosa-associated microbiota respond to iron supplementation (40, 41).Secondly, our study used randomly sampled stool.
As described by Hsieh and col- leagues, stool preparation (randomly sampled versus homogenized) does not impactintra-individual bacterial diversity. Still, there are differences at the level of individualtaxa, including higher proportions of Faecalibacterium and decreased proportions of Bacteroides (42).As participants randomly collected their stool, our results may repre- sent an over or under-sampling of speci ﬁc bacterial taxa (43).As many bacteria were not detected in our samples during 16S rRNA gene sequencing, future studies may testfor speci ﬁc pathogens such as Salmonella ,Escherichia ,Campylobacter ,Vibrio , and Plesiomonas.Finally, we acknowledge that there were only two collection time points during our 12 week trial.These two time points allowed us to record overall change ver-sus any rapid ﬂuctuations, which may be of interest in future research (21).
To our understanding, this is the ﬁrst study to examine the effect of iron supple- mentation on the gut microbiome in non-pregnant WRA. We observed that iron sup-plementation, in the form of ferrous bisglycinate, increases the relative abundance ofEnterobacteriaceae .Currently, the WHO recommendations suggest that women in Cambodia receive daily iron supplementation for three months; however, besides asmall number of studies, there is little evidence examining the possible harms of thisregimen.We hope the present study provides a foundation for future research toensure policymakers and Cambodian WRA have the necessary information to guideiron supplementation practices.MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design and eligibility criteria.This study was nested within a larger randomized controlled trial of oral iron supplementation that included 480 non-pregnant Cambodian WRA from the rural Kampong Thom province.
The primary trial aimed to assess the non-inferiority of 18 mg iron as ferrous bisglycinate compared with 60 mg iron as ferrous sulfate on mean ferritin concentrations and other bio-markers following 12 weeks daily supplementation. Study inclusion criteria involved healthy, non-pregnant women 18 to 45 years old who consented to participate in the study by providing blood and stool samples and resided in the study location for theentire study period.The women lived in villages within the following health center catchment areas: PreyKuy, Tboung Krapeu, and Srayov.Participants were excluded if they had any known illness or disease,were pregnant, or were taking antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-in ﬂammatory drugs, dietary supplements, or vitamin and mineral supplements in the previous 12 weeks.Women were recruited by convenience sam-pling (rolling recruitment began in December 2019), and if eligible, they were enrolled once they providedwritten consent.
Women were randomized at the health center level with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to eitherEffects of Iron on Cambodian Women Gut Microbiomes Microbiology Spectrum May/June 2023 Volume 11 Issue 3 10.1128/spectrum.05273-22 8 ferrous sulfate, ferrous bisglycinate, or placebo ( n= 160 in each trial group). The ferrous sulfate capsule contained 60 mg of elemental iron (standard treatment), the ferrous bisglycinate capsule contained 18 mgof elemental iron (experimental treatment), and the placebo capsules contained microcrystalline cellulose(no elemental iron).The capsules were identical in composition, taste, smell, and appearance.Women pro- vided a neat stool sample using an at-home stool collection kit at baseline ( ﬁve-week rolling enrollment: January to February 2020) and after 12 weeks of daily supplementation (April to May 2020) (Fig.
S1) (43).Information, such as gastrointestinal indicators, were captured in baseline and 12-week questionnaires.Regular monitoring visits were made by local research staff to participants ’homes to ensure daily supple- mentation adherence and record reported side effects. Trial investigators, research staff, and participantswere blinded to the assigned trials.The full trial protocol has been reported elsewhere (44).Stool collection.Stool samples were placed on ice and transported for 4 to 6 h to the National Institute of Public Health Laboratory in Phnom Penh, Cambodia and were immediately frozen at 220°C.They were later shipped on dry ice to the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada laboratory and were frozen upon receipt at 280°C until analysis.Laboratory analyses.
A subset of stool samples ( n= 172) was randomly selected for microbial analy- sis using a computer-generated list ( n= 59 received ferrous sulfate; n= 55 received ferrous bisglycinate; n= 58 received placebo). (i) DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing.DNA was extracted using a Mobio PowerFecal extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.DNA purity was assessed using aNanodrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc.).DNA samples were submitted for 16SrRNA gene sequencing at the Integrated Microbiome Resource (IMR) at Dalhousie University.The IMRprovided 16S rRNA gene primers (B969F and BA1406R).Variable regions V6 to V8 of the bacterial 16SrRNA gene were ampli ﬁed from all puri ﬁed DNA samples using 25 cycles of PCR and Phusion 1high- ﬁ- delity polymerase.Ampli ﬁed DNA was then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using paired-end 300 bpsequencing.(ii) Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).
Target genes associated with EPEC, bfpA ,a n d eae,w e r e ampli ﬁed from extracted DNA using SSoAdvanced Universal SYBR green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc). The primers weredesigned by Cabal and colleagues and are listed here: bfpA-F (CMGGTGTGATGTTTTACTAC), bfpA-R(TGCCCAATATACARACCAT), eae-F (GCTATAACRTCTTCATTGATC), and eae-R (RCTACTTTTRAAATAGTCTCG)(Integrated DNA Technologies) (18, 19).DNA extraction was performed on EPEC strain E2348/69 using thePrepMan Ultra Sample Preparation Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc) for use as a positive control for the bfpA and eaegenes (18, 19).The manufacturer's protocol was modi ﬁed as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, and 52°C for 30 s, followed by a melt-curve analysisfrom 65°C to 95°C.All samples were run in triplicate, and the data were analyzed using the CFX MaestroV.4.1.2433.1219 (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc).
Data analyses. (i) 16S sequence processing.Paired-end reads of V6-V8 ampli ﬁcation primers were trimmed off using cutadapt with default settings (45).Forward and reverse primer trimmed reads werestitched together using the QIIME2 (v.QIMME2-2020.8) VSEARCH join-pairs plugin (46, 47).Stitchedreads were quality ﬁltered using the QIIME2 q-score plugin with default settings.The QIIME2 plugin Deblur was used to group ﬁltered primer-free stitched reads into amplicon sequence variants using a trim length of 399 bp and a minimum read requirement of one (48).The mean sequencing depth acrosssamples was then calculated using QIIME2, and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs).ASVs with readcounts lower than 0.1% across all samples were removed.ASVs were then placed into the Greengenes13_8 99% reference 16S rRNA gene tree using the QIIME2 plugin fragment-insertion SEPP (49 –51).(ii) Microbiome 16S diversity analysis.
Rarefaction curves were generated using the QIIME2 diver- sity alpha-rarefaction visualizer (Fig. S2).A sequencing depth of 5000 reads was chosen based on thedepth at which microbial richness plateaued.Diversity metrics were generated using QIIME2 with a rare-faction depth of 5000 reads and the previously generated phylogenetic tree.Changes in richness, even-ness, Shannon diversity, and Faith ’s phylogenetic diversity were then measured between weeks 0 and 12 and compared to the placebo group for each iron supplement group using a Wilcoxon Rank SumTest.P-values were then corrected using the Holm-Bonferroni method to help control for family-wise error rates.Three different beta diversity metrics were compared to identify any structural changes in the gut microbiome of trial participants.These metrics were weighted UniFrac, unweighted UniFrac, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.
Changes in pairwise distances/dissimilarities between week 0 before supplementationand week 12 after supplementation were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. For each distance/dis-similarity matrix, we conducted PERMANOVA testing, examining the interaction between trial arm andweek of sample collection, using the adonis2 function in the vegan R package.We additionally accountedfor our repeated sampling design by setting block permutations to subject ID.Furthermore, each matrixwas also used in principal coordinates analysis to visualize any potential clustering by trial arm and week of sample collection.(iii) Microbiome 16S differential abundance.ASVs were assigned taxonomy using a QIIME2 naive Bayes classi ﬁer trained on the 99% Silva V138 database (52).
Samples below 5000 reads were ﬁltered out, and read counts were converted to either relative abundances or centered log-ratios with a pseudo count of 1.After ﬁ ltering out samples with less than 5000 reads and those without a pair (missing either baseline or end- line), 40 sample pairs remained in the ferrous sulfate group, 46 in the ferrous bisglycinate group, and 47 in theplacebo group. These samples were then examined for differential microbial abundance using four separatetools: ALDEx2, Corncob, MaAsLin2, and ANCOM-II (53 –56).These bioinformatic tools were chosen based on previous performance analysis and the ability to test methods that were compositionally aware (ALDEx2 andEffects of Iron on Cambodian Women Gut Microbiomes Microbiology Spectrum May/June 2023 Volume 11 Issue 3 10.1128/spectrum.05273-22 9 ANCOM-II) or tested for differences in microbial proportions (Corncob, MaAsLin2) (57).
Time and trial groups were assessed for signi ﬁcant associations with genus level abundances. During modeling, the time reference group was set to the baseline collection and the trial reference group was placebo.After differential abundance testing, any genera or ASVs found in less than 5% of samples across the data set were removed from consider-ation before multiple test corrections.ALDEx2 was run using 128 Monte Carlo samplings and generalized linear modeling using default Benjamin-Hochberg false discovery correction.The interaction between time and trial arm was exam- ined for signi ﬁcance.Corncob was run by combining data into a phyloseq object and then running the differentialTest function using a Wald test and controlling for differential variability in the interaction between trial arm and week of collection (58).MaAsLin2 was run using default settings and an arcsine square-root transformation.
Interactions were modeled using arti ﬁcial interaction columns generated in R as described in the MaAsLin2 tutorial. Finally, ANCOM-II was run by ﬁrst identifying structural zeros using the function feature_table_pre_process.Structural zeros and metadata were then passed into the main ANCOM function using the interaction between trial arm and time as the “main_var ”and group 1 time as the “adj_formula ”.(iv) qPCR Analysis.Of the 172 baseline-endline pairs, 166 baseline, and 166 endline samples were used for qPCR analysis (some samples were removed due to insuf ﬁcient material).The standard curve formula for bfpA (r 2= 0.9959) was applied to the Cq values obtained from each sample (Fig.S3).The bpfA gene was not present in every sample; therefore, presence-absence analysis was conducted using mixed effects logistic regression, examining the interaction between time and trial arm with a random subject effect.
The eaegene was present in most samples; therefore, estimated DNA quantities were examined by ﬁrst constructing a standard curve from positive controls. The standard curve formula for eae(r2= 0.9856) was then applied to the Cq values obtained from each sample (Fig.S4).For the pur- poses of estimated DNA quantity analysis, we set the log DNA quantity of samples lacking a Cq value as the detection limit measured on positive control samples.Changes in log eaequantity (ng) were then calculated for each sample between weeks 0 and 12.This change was then examined across trial armsusing an ANOVA.Ethics approval and consent to participate.Ethical approval was obtained from the University of British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Board, Canada (H15-00933, 19 June 2015) and the National Ethics Committee for Health Research, Cambodia (110-NECHR, 24 April 2015) and was registered at clinicaltrials .gov (NCT04017598).Data and materials availability.
