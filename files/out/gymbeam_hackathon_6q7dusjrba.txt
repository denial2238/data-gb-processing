Herein we developed an MPC-based system, which was low-heat-releasing and fast-curing in this study, by compound - ing with self-curing calcium silicate cements (CSCs).The MPC com - posed of magnesium oxide (MgO), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH 2PO4), disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na 2HPO 4), magnesium hy- drogen phosphate trihydrate (MgHPO 4�3H 2O) and chitosan were weakly basic, which would be more stable in vivo.The physicochem - ical properties indicated that the addition of CSCs could increase the final setting time while decrease the heat release.
Meanwhile, the CSCs could endow MPC substrate with apatite re-mineralization reactivity, especially, which add 25wt.% CSCs showed the most significant apatite deposition. What’s more, the mechanical evolu - tion in buffer demonstrated CSCs could enhance and sustain the mechanical strength during degradation, and the internal constructs of cement implants could still be reconstructed by μCT analysis in rabbit femoral bone defect model in vivo.Particularly, appropriate CSCs adjusted the biodegradation and promoted new bone tissue regeneration in vivo.Totally, the MPC/CSCs composite system endows bioactivity and sustains mechanical strength of the MPC, which may be promising for expending the clinical applica - tions of MPC-based bone cements.
Keywords: magnesium phosphate cements; calcium silicate cements; bioactivity; mechanical property; bone tissue regeneration Introduction Because of aging, accidents, osteoporosis and other pathogenicity factors, bone fracture is common in human diseases, which en- danger people’s health and cause additional medical expenses [1, 2]. When the scale of bone defect causing by orthopedic dis- eases exceeds the limit of human self-repair (critical bone de- fect), human intervention and surgical treatment are needed [3].It is reported that nearly 4 million people in the world need to un- dergo bone repair surgery every year [4].Nowadays, autografting remains the preferred solution of orthopedist for the repair of bone, while autologous bone grafting is an additional injury to patients and increases the risk of infection.
Besides, for some spe- cial bone injuries, such as vertebral collapse fracture, due to anatomical factors, autologous bone transplantation is not the first choice while bone cement injection is usually used in clinical treatment. It shows that self-curing bone cement is becoming im- portant in the clinical application of bone defects, especially in the repair of various and complex bone defects.In the field of bone defect repair, many biomedical materials have been developed clinically based on the difference of defect site, defect degree and defect shape [5–7].Among them, due to rheological properties of slurry, self-curing materials such as cal- cium phosphate cements (CPCs) can adapt to bone defects of var- ious shapes and sizes [8], which endow them with minimally invasive repair capability for complex bone defects [9, 10].CPCs are one of the main cements applied for bone regeneration in Received: May 12, 2024.Revised: June 26, 2024.Accepted: July 8, 2024 © The Author(s) 2024.

In previous studies, it has been confirmed that some of MPC is not toxic to cells and has biocompatibility, which make it possible to be utilized as medical materials [12, 14]. It is worth mentioning that magnesium ion has multiple effects on cells [15], which can stimulate osteoblast differentiation and in- hibit osteoclast formation [16].Compared with apatite-type CPC (18–36 months [11]), MPC has a more moderate degradation effi- ciency (7–10 months [17]), and Mg2þmay be able to restrain the crystallization [18].However, there are still drawbacks that are not clinically applicable of MPC.As to the high reaction heat and velocity of MPC [13], generally, choosing MgO sintered above 1500�C (magnesia) as the reactant and borax addition may be- come the effective measurements to improve the related defects [19–21 ], but MgO has limited effects, and borax is harmful to hu- man body.
At the same time, MPC has the phenomenon of early dissociation due to the unbalanced excess components and solu- ble components. On the other hand, the special skeleton- adhesive structure of MPC leads to the breakdown of the system in the later degradation process with terrible long-term struc - tural stability [13].It is well-known that calcium silicate cements (CSCs) mainly composed of tricalcium silicate (C3S) and dicalcium silicate (C2S) are important parts of Portland cement.In clinical application, CSCs has been utilized in pulp repair therapy [22–24 ].It has been reported that CSCs could induce mineralization activity and pro- mote cell proliferation and differentiation [25–29 ].Unfortunately, CSCs tend to lead slow self-setting time and mediocre compres - sive strength during the entire self-setting process.
Based on properties mentioned above, it is rational to assume that the ad- dition of CSCs to MPC would endow MPC with bioactivity and probably moderate the self-setting time of the composite cements [30]. In addition, it has been studied that CSCs have vol- ume expansion during continuous hydration, which might pro- vide an opportunity to improve the collapse of MPC in the later stage.In addition, the brittleness of ceramic materials is unfavorable in the process of bone tissue repair.In order to achieve good flu- idity, injection and anti-collapsibility of inorganic cements, there have been many studies on the composition of organic compo - nents into inorganic cements.Many polysaccharide components such as cellulose, chitosan and chitin have been utilized to im- prove the plasticity and even enhance the mechanical properties of bone cements [31, 32].
Specially, it was reported recently that the mechanical strength of MPC could be greatly enhanced with a high proportion of polysaccharide content [33]. Meanwhile, or- ganic solvents such as glycerin, polyethylene glycol may endow inorganic cements with excellent injectability [34, 35].Based on the aforementioned consideration, it is reasonable to develop MPC-based bone cement via compounding with CSCs and chitosan.CSCs would regulate the physicochemical and bio- logical properties of MPC substrate, including but not limited to reducing heat release, sustaining mechanical strength and endowing bioactivity while the chitosan could improve material brittleness [36] and buffer stress concentration due to stiffness differences between MPC and CSCs.Herein, we explored the effects of CSCs content on MPC-based bone cement.
The research results showed that, such an MPC-based bone cements were with great potential to bone defect regeneration and repair, which might further utilize organic matter as carrier for minimally in- vasive treatment. Materials and methods Reagents and materials Reagents including calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO 3)2�4H 2O), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH 2PO4), tetraethyl orthosili - cate (TEOS), hydrochloric (HCl) acid and chitosan were brought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Shanghai.Disodium hy- drogen phosphate (Na 2HPO 4), magnesium hydrogen phosphate trihydrate (MgHPO4�3H 2O) and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminome - thane (Tris) were obtained from Aladdin, Shanghai.Magnesium oxide (MgO) was from Macklin, Shanghai.Simulated body fluid (SBF) was achieved from Yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd, Shanghai.All of the reagents and materials above were utilized without prior purification.
Preparation of powders The MPC powders included MgO, KH2PO4, Na2HPO 4 and MgHPO 4�3H 2O (molar ratio: Mg/P¼3.4, (K þNa)/P¼1:1; mass ra- tio: KH2PO4/Na 2HPO 4 ¼1:2). MgO powders were calcinated at 1550�C for 3h to reduce its reactivity while KH2PO4 was mixed with ethanol and ball-milled for 6h beforehand to obtain super - fine powder.CSCs were composed of C3S and C2S, which were synthesized by the sol-gel method with a respective Ca/Si ratio of 2.8 and 1.8 as described previously [37].TEOS was hydrolyzed with 20ml of nitric acid and 400ml of deionized water per mole for 30minutes.Then, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate with molar volume 3 times/2 times that of TEOS was added for continuous stirring for 3h.The resulting gel was aged in a 60�C oven for 2days and then transferred to a 120�C oven for drying.
The C3S powders were obtained by calcinating the dry gel at 1400�C in a muffle furnace for 8h, and the C2S powders were obtained by calcinating the dry gel at 800�C in a muffle furnace for 3h. The C3S and C2S powders were separately mixed with anhydrous ethanol to ground with zirconia ball grounding media for 6h to obtain the superfine powder with a particle size below 5μm after dried, and the fineness of the sol-gel-derived C2S and C3S was smaller than the other raw materials (Supplementary Table S1).Preparation of composite cements MPC without CSCs (0wt.%) and MPC-based bone cements con- taining different amounts of CSCs (15wt.%, 25wt.%, 35wt.%, in which the content of C2S was maintained at 5wt.%) marked as MPC, MPC/CSC-15, MPC/CSC-25 and MPC/CSC-35 were prepared as following (2.5wt.% chitosan were included in each group; Table 1).The four groups of composite powders were well-mixed in anhydrous ethanol.
Each evenly mixed powder was modulated with deionized water for 30s to form a slurry for test of self- setting properties and to prepare samples for evaluation in vitro and in vivo separately. The samples to test in vitro were prepared in plastic molds (Ø 8.70 mm × 6.35 mm) and the samples in vivo Table 1.Compositions of different MPC/CSCs composite cements powders MPC MPC/CSC-15 MPC/CSC-25 MPC/CSC-35 MPC (wt.%) 97.5 82.5 72.5 62.5 C3S (wt.%) 0 10 20 30 C2S (wt.%) 0 5 5 5 Chitosan (wt.%) 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.52 | Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol.11, rbae100 were achieved from pouring the slurry into a PTFE mold (Ø 6mm × 8mm) with their respective liquid-powder ratios (LPRs; Table 2).After 1h, the cements were demolded and then placed in 37�C water bath with saturated wet steam for 7days.After tak- ing out the samples, the samples in vitro were dried in the oven at 37�C, and the samples in vivo were sterilized by high-pressure steam at 120�C for use.
Primary characterization of powders and cement samples The phases of MPC and MPC-based powders were characterized by PANalytical X’Pert PRO X-ray diffraction (XRD, Netherlands) at CuKα anode voltage of 40kV and response current of 40mA, with a step size of 0.026�/2θ and a range of 5��80�. Meanwhile, four kinds of MPC-based cement samples were rinsed with deionized water and then dried in an oven at 37�C after being cured at 37�C with saturated humidity for 7days, and their chemical composi - tion was analyzed by XRD after being crushed.In addition, thin slices of each component sample with a thickness of 2mm were prepared, kept in a water bath with satu - rated humidity at 37�C for 7days, and dried in an oven at 37�C.After the gold spraying process, the surface morphology was ob- served through a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Gemini Sigma 300, Zeiss, Germany) at an accelerating voltage of 6kV.
Self-setting time measurement The final setting time of the MPC-based bone cements (n¼3) was roughly measured by a vicar instrument (Luda, Shanghai, China) according to the national standard GB/T1346-2011. The falling distance of the final setting needle was less than or equal to 0.5mm to determine that the cement had finally set.The initial and final setting time of the paste samples prepared with MgO before and after calcination at 1500�C were evaluated by using the same procedure as mentioned above.Heat release evaluation The high heat release of MPC is a common problem, and hence the heat release of the MPC-based bone cement needs to be eval- uated.The initial temperature and peak heat release tempera - ture of the slurry modulated as samples in vitro of 2.0g powder for each group (n¼3) were determined by infrared thermometer.The formula was as: Heat release ¼(T − T0)/2, where T and T0 represented the peak heat release temperature and the initial temperature, respectively.
Initial mechanical strength measurement In order to evaluate the mechanics of the MPC-based bone ce- ment, cylindrical samples (n¼5) of different components were prepared by the preparation of in vitro test. Then they were cured in a water bath with saturated humidity at 37�C for different time points (1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35days), and dried at 37�C for 3days for testing.Taking compressive strength as the mechani - cal evaluation index, the load loading speed was set to 0.5mm/ min through the mechanical pressure testing machine test, and the calculation formula was as follows: σc ¼4Fbc/πD2, where σc, Fbc and D were compressive strength, fracture stress, and sample diameter, respectively.Bio-dissolution in vitro Taking Tris-HCl buffer (pH¼7.4, 37�C) as the soaking solution, the physicochemical behavior of the MPC-based bone cements in the soaking solution was analyzed according to the soaking liquid volume and sample mass ratio of 50ml/g.
The samples in vitro were placed in the soaking solution for 35days after a 7-day 37�C saturated humidity water bath, and the pH value of the soaking solution was monitored by a pH meter at time points 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35days, respectively. The concentration of Ca, Mg, Na, K, Si and P elements in the composite system was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) by taking 1ml of the supernatant soaking solutions and adding the same amount of fresh Tris-HCl soaking solution at the same time (n¼3).Also, the changes in pH value in the aque - ous medium was measured within the initial 48h.In addition, mass loss analysis was performed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12weeks.100% fresh soaking solution was changed every 2 weeks.The samples (n¼3) at the corresponding time points were soaked with absorbent paper and weighed, and the samples were moist - ened after 7days of 37�C saturated humidity water bath as the initial mass.
The mass loss of cements was calculated by the for- mula: Mass loss ¼M/M 0 × 100%, where M and M0 were the qual - ity after and before soaking, respectively. In order to evaluate the corrosion resistance and mechanical stability of the MPC-based bone cements in liquid environment, the samples were im- mersed in Tris-HCl buffer for 12weeks, and the fresh buffer was replaced by 40% every two weeks.At time points 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12weeks, the samples (n¼5) were taken out and dried at 37�C, and the compressive strength was determined by mechanical pressure testing machine.The parameters and calculation for- mulas are consistent with those in 2.7.Apatite mineralization capacity in vitro The biomimetic hydroxyapatite (HA) re-mineralization of the ce- ment materials was evaluated by immersing in vitro samples with SBF.Thin discs of the MPC-based bone cements with differ - ent proportions were prepared using a syringe mold with a diam - eter of 8.70 mm and a height of 2mm.
They were kept in a water bath with saturated humidity at 37�C for 7days, and after being autoclaved at 120�C, the samples were soaked according to the surface area to SBF solution volume ratio of 0.1 cm2/ml. The sam- ples were taken out two weeks later.The surface was cleaned with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, and dried at 37�C.After gold spraying, the surface morphology and elemental analysis were performed by SEM and energy disperse spectros - copy (EDS).Animal model of bone defect in vivo Samples in vivo of the MPC-based bone cements were implanted into an artificial critical defect on the rabbit femur.According to the preset experiment, 16 male New Zealand white rabbits (about 3kg) aged 5months were ordered to complete the femoral con- dyle implantation experiment.The experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhejiang University, and the ethics batch number is ZJU20230091.The rabbits were divided into two groups, 6 for 4-week trials and 10 for 18-week trials.
Before surgery, rabbits were given a dose of 1mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital from an ear vein accord - ing to their body weight. After cutting the flesh and periosteum, a bone defect (Ø6 mm × 8mm) was created in the femoral head Table 2.LPR Of the MPC-based bone cements MPC MPC/CSC-15 MPC/CSC-25 MPC/CSC-35 LPR (ml/g) 0.28 0.31 0.33 0.35Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol.11, rbae100 | 3 with a trephine.Samples of the MPC-based bone cements were implanted and then sutured.Erythromycin ointment was applied to the wound, and penicillin was injected intramuscular for 3days.At the designated time points of 4 and 18weeks, the rab- bits were anesthetized and killed, and the femur specimens were removed and immobilized with 4% paraformaldehyde fixative (4% PFA).Radiological analysis The preliminary observation of the bone specimens was per- formed by an X-ray scanner (XPERT, KUBTEC Co., USA).
The specimens were imaged under an X-ray with a response current of 50mA and a voltage of 45kV to obtain a qualitative general evaluation of the bone and material. At the same time, the condi - tion of new bone (volume and distribution) was analyzed by a μCT system (AX2000 CT scanner, Always Imaging, Shanghai).The scans were performed along the axis of the femur at ambient temperature with a voltage of 120kV and a response current of 100mA.Each bone specimen was photographed for 5min using a micro-focused X-ray source (FineTec 160kV, Germany) with an X-ray detector (NDT 1717M; pixel size: 139mm; number of pixels: 3072 ×3072).The continuous cross-sectional images generated by this procedure had a resolution of 15.6 mm with an exposure time of 500ms, using a voxel size set to 14mm in the isotropic measurement.
Through AYRecon software reconstruction, the target area is set as a cylindrical area of Ø6 mm × 8mm, and the radius direction is expanded outward by 300 μm to compensate for the drilling error. Material and new bone were distinguished and rendered according to density differences.The required new bone volume fraction (BV/TV), residual material volume fraction (RV/TV), and bone trabecular number (Tb.N) were obtained through VG Studio MAX.Histological progressing The femur specimens that were immersed in the polyformalde - hyde fixing solution for more than one week were dehydrated step by step with 80–100% ethanol, washed with xylene, and then embedded in polymethyl methacrylate.After three weeks of cur- ing, the specimens were cut with a cutting machine (SP1600, Leica, Germany) to separate the small pieces of the femoral head close to the size of the implant area, and then after grinding, each femoral head specimen was reduced to eight slices.
After polishing the sheet with a polisher (MP-2B), it is stained with H&E and Masson, observed under Leica optical microscope, adjusted and analyzed by a software (Oplenic_pro). Statistical analysis All data were represented by mean ± standard deviation (SD), and the data were processed by One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS software.When the value of P<0.05, the results were considered statistically significant.Results Primary characterization of the cements The XRD pattern (Figure 1A) for the powder of the mixed MPC contained MgO, KH2PO4, Na2HPO 4 and MgHPO 4�3H 2O mainly showed the peeks for the MgO powder, possibly due to the high molar ratio of Mg/P in the mixtures.As for the high-temperature phase of C3S powders, due to the nonstoichiometric Ca/Si ratio (i.e.2.8) in the sol synthetic condition, the C3S had no impurity peak of CaO at �37�and �53�/2θ.The sintering temperature of C2S was low and the purity was also relatively high.
XRD patterns (Figure 1B) of the MPC-based bone cements after 37�C saturated humidity water bath showed that the MPC had been hydrated to produce a network of potassium magnesium phosphate (KMgPO 4) or sodium magnesium phosphate (NaMgPO 4) and an excess MgO skeleton. Due to the small content of KH2PO4 itself, the peak of po- tassium magnesium phosphate hexahydrate (KMgPO 4�6H 2O) visi- ble in the XRD pattern was very low, mainly the phase of NaMgPO 4, and a small amount of unreacted MgHPO 4�3H 2O.In the substrate with MgO, KMgPO 4 and NaMgPO 4 as the main hydration phases, the proportion of calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) gradually increased, specifically showing a steamed bun-shaped dispersion peak, while the peak of NaMgPO 4 decreased.Besides, the microstructure of MPC, MPC/CSC-15, MPC/CSC-25 and MPC/CSC-35 could be shown by SEM observation (Figure 2A).The hydrated form of pure MPC was gelatinous, which was em- bedded with a lot of MgO skeleton.
When 10% of C3S and 5% of C2S were added, a needle-like dispersed phase appeared in the substrate, and the interphase state showed the same situation of being wrapped by KMgPO 4/NaMgPO 4 network phase with MgO. As the amount of C3S increased, the needle-like C3S phase in- creased significantly.When the amount of C3S reached 30%, the network of MPC hydrate was interrupted into discontinuous phase.From the perspective of morphology, the needle/rod had become the skeleton of the discontinuous phase.Self-setting property analysis Deionized water was utilized as the blending liquid of MPC-based bone cements, the experiment showed that the LPR required by Figure 1.Phase composition of the precursor powders and early hydration products.XRD patterns of MPC, C3S and C2S powders (A).XRD images of samples with a 7-day 37�C saturated humidity water bath of MPC, MPC/CSC-15, MPC/CSC-25 and MPC/CSC-35 (B).4 | Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol.11, rbae100 MPC was very low.
LPR¼0.28 ml/g was taken as the LPR of pure MPC phase, while the LPR required by C3S and C2S slurry itself was much larger for slurry preparation, due to smaller particle size and higher specific surface area of the silicate powders in the mixtures. Therefore, 0.31, 0.33 and 0.35 ml/g were used as the LPR of the MPC/CSCs bone cements.The results of curing time (Figures 2B and Supplementary Figure S1) showed that the rapid curing of MPC greatly accelerated the curing time of the compos - ite system, and the addition of C3S and C2S further increased the curing final solidification time and shortened the initial solidifi - cation time (both within 6min), and in particular the high ther- mal pretreatment of MgO at 1500�C would prolong �0.8-fold of the setting time (Supplementary Figure S1).On the other hand, the MPC used in this experiment had the characteristics of low heat release.
Meanwhile, the addition of C3S, C2S and chitosan also reduced the heat release of the system, making the use of MPC-based bone cements within the range of tolerance of organ - isms (Figure 2C). Since the actual maternity environment in the body was close to the saturated humidity water bath environ - ment of 37�C, the cured bone cement was placed in the saturated humidity water bath environment of 37�C to monitor its strength fluctuation and analyze the maximum mechanical strength.As shown in Figure 2D, as the content of C3S increased, the time for the MPC-based bone cements to reach the maximum mechanical strength was delayed.The results of 37�C saturated humidity water bath within 5weeks showed that the pure MPC phase had the highest mechanical strength and the fastest time to reach the maximum strength.The mechanical strength of the groups of C3S and C2S added increased steadily and was still an upward trend even after reaching 35days.
Degradation of cements in vitro According to ICP analysis, the concentration of Mg ions in Tris buffer showed a steady upward trend, especially the groups of MPC and MPC/CSC-35, which were slightly faster than that of MPC/CSC-25 and MPC/CSC-15, while for the concentration of Ca ions, only MPC/CSC-35 had a significant initial increase com- pared with other groups. After 7days, all groups leveled off (Figure 3A and B).The concentration of K and Na ions increased faster with more C3S before 5days, and the curve tended to be flat after 5days.It was worth mentioning that MPC/CSC-15 was always in a state of growth and finally exceeds all other groups, as shown in Figure 3C and D.As for phosphorus and silicon con- centrations, as shown in Figure 3E and F, as the main elements in the anionic part of the system, the release level was generally low, and the release peak appeared in the early 2weeks, and then decreased, indicating that the early release was redeposited.
Among them, MPC/CSC-35 was stable as a whole, and the release speed basically does not change, and tends to zero.

It was worth mentioning that after 14days, the pH rise in the MPC/CSC- 25 began to lag behind that in the MPC/CSC-15 (Figure 3G). In general, the mass loss trend of the MPC-based bone cements was the same, and the mass of MPC itself decreased the slowest at the same time.MPC/CSC-15 increased the degradation activity of MPC with the introduction of a small amount of C3S and C2S.However, when the content of C3S continued to increase, degra - dation slowed again.For MPC/CSC-35, after 10weeks, the degra - dation rate even lagged that of the pure MPC (Figure 3H).Similarly, the mechanical decay behavior of bone cement was crucial to evaluate its performance in use.As shown in Figure 3I, 8 weeks ago, the mechanics of MPC reached the maximum value and remained stable, while the initial strength of the groups add- ing C3S and C2S was lower than the pure MPC and maintaining a steady upward trend.
It was clear that the MPC/CSC-15 and MPC/ CSC-35 had almost the same upward slope, while the MPC/CSC- 25 had a greater growth rate than both. At 12weeks, there was a mechanical decay in the MPC, and MPC/CSC-15 just rose to the same level.The MPC/CSC-25 surpassed the MPC for the first time to reach a highest value, with a compressive strength of 43.2 MPa.Apatite mineralization in vitro The chemical deposition reaction (apatite re-mineralization) on the surface of MPC-based bone cements soaked in SBF was gener - ally used to assess the remineralization ability of biological mate - rials.Figure 4 shows the SEM image of the surface of bone cements soaked in SBF for 2weeks.The results showed that there were no apatite microspheres on the surface of pure MPC, and very small microspheres with the diameter about 0.05 μm could be seen in MPC/CSC-15 at 8000 times field of view.
With the in- crease content of C3S, for the group of MPC/CSC-25, the dense and full spherical apatite-like spherical deposit could be ob- served. Besides, with C3S further increasing to C3S-30, the aver - age diameter of apatite spheres decreased again and the number of apatite spheres increased, developing into a mineralized sur- face with multinomial branches.EDS analysis showed that the overall Ca/P ratio on the surface of the microspheres in the MPC- based bone cements was 0.48, 0.81, 1.26 and 1.79, respectively.The group with the Ca/P atomic ratio of 1.26 showed the best mineralized deposition effect, and the group with the Ca/P atomic ratio of 1.79 showed a decrease but an increase in the number of mineralized microspheres.It could be seen that the Figure 3.In vitro ion release, pH changes, mass decrease and mechanical loss in Tris-HCl buffer (pH¼7.4).

At the end of the scan, the volume fraction of new bone, the volume fraction of remain - ing material and the number of bone trabeculae were quantita - tively analyzed by the software, and the results were shown in Figure 6B–D. The results of femur specimen and X-ray scan showed that the implant was located at the site of the bone defect.Comparing the specimens of 4 and 18weeks, sporadic low-density areas in- side the material increased in the specimens of 18weeks, indicat - ing that the material was degraded on the original basis.Meanwhile, there were more low-density areas inside the mate - rial in the MPC at 18weeks than other groups.According to μCT images, the degradation degree of materials in MPC at 18weeks was significantly increased compared with that at 4weeks while the new bone attached to the lateral was not increased more, reflecting the poor biological activity of MPC, which was consis - tent with the results of in vitro mineralization.
The addition of C3S and C2S significantly reduced the surface erosion and degra - dation, but significantly more bone formation near the surface. The results of BV/TV, RV/TV and Tb.N analyzed by the soft- ware could be quantitatively found that BV/TV of four groups (MPC, MPC/CSC-15, MPC/CSC-25 and MPC/CSC-35) were 7%, 14%, 9% and 12%, respectively, at 4weeks with little difference.The two groups of MPC and MPC/CSC-15 did not show significant increases, while others showed significant increases (Figure 6B).In addition, the characteristics of the remaining materials were consistent with the results of bone formation (BV/TV), and the degradation of the materials in MPC was close to 20%.With the contents addition of C3S and C2S, especially MPC/CSC-25 and MPC/CSC-35, the degradation of the controlled materials was only about 4% (Figure 6C).
Besides, the MPC/CSC-25 groups showed a faster increase in trabecular number compared with other groups and the MPC/CSC-15 still increased compared with the MPC, while the MPC/CSC-35 showed a decrease in trabecular number at 18weeks (Figure 6D). Histological assay H&E and Masson staining of histological sections of rabbit femur specimens are shown in Figures 7 and 8.H&E staining showed that the MPC-based cements did not having the significant ad- vantage of materials degrade and osteogenesis and the integra - tion between the cement periphery and bone tissue was not ideal, supposing that excessive release of Mg2þin the MPC sub- strate was unfavorable to bone integration.At 18weeks, it was found that the MPC substrate was degraded into a fluffy porous state, but no bone growth was observed obviously.
When the C3S and C2S were added in the modified groups, the whole material was in a relatively dense state and did not provide effective micropores for new bone to grow in, but the surrounding bone in- tegration and the amounts of new bone increased. As for Masson staining, the group of MPC/CSC-25 and MPC/CSC-15 demon - strated the better osteogenesis at 18weeks, surrounding by an amount of new bone, but there was still no new bone growth within the material.Besides, relatively abundant collagen fibers could be observed around the materials mixed with C3S and C2S at 18weeks, and almost no muscle fibers were found.Discussion It was found in the process of exploration that the MPC-based bone cement would degrade in the early stage due to the soluble content [38].
Besides, the solubility product of the hydrated prod - uct after solidification of MPC was larger than that of main - stream CPC materials, and its structural characteristics based on MgO as the skeleton may lead to the collapse of its cross-linked Figure 4. Ability to induce mineralization.SEM images of surface morphology of the MPC-based bone cements after soaking in SBF for 2weeks.Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol.11, rbae100 | 7 system after gradual degradation.It was inconsistent with the growth rate of new bone and thus it will lead the ability of the de- fect site to withstand stress to decline rapidly, resulting in repair failure.
Based on this, weakly basic CSC with less soluble compo - nents was used in this study to strictly ensure the ratio of chemi - cal reaction; C3S and C2S were used to maintain the stability of the system in the middle and later stages [39], meanwhile in- creasing the biological activity of the system, which will expand the possibility of clinical applications. In construction cement, it is mostly utilized MgO and ammo - nium dihydrogen phosphate (NH 4H2PO4) as precursor powders of MPCs, and the self-curing product is ‘struvite’ (NH 4MgPO 4�6H 2O).Among the different self-curing product types of MPC, the NH 4MgPO 4 system has the highest mechanical strength.Therefore, for engineering cements, although ammonium salt will cause intense heat release, its advantages are more signifi - cant than disadvantages to some extent.
Besides, the building MPC has borax and MgO with very low activity as a means to de- lay the heat release time, reduce the heat release and extend the curing time, and fly ash as a means to increase the mechanical stability. Unfortunately, ammonium salts decompose in the body to form ammonia, which is harmful to organisms, while borax and fly ash are also biologically toxic.Particularly, MgO with very low activity is not conducive to biodegradation and it is not con- ducive to enhance the bonding strength between MPC particles.Hence, MPC of this composition is not optimal for biomedical bone cement.In order to meet the needs of clinical applications, the researchers have studied the MPC system with the same ‘struvite’ structure of KMgPO 4�6H 2O products.The KMgPO 4 sys- tem has a definite chemical reaction formula and reaction product, which is similar to the reaction of NH 4MgPO 4 system, and is an excellent alternative material for NH 4MgPO 4 cement.
Indeed, this system does not solve the problem of heat release and curing time, besides, the problem of mechanical decay still exists. In addition, a similar reaction was found when sodium ions replaced potassium ions in the same position.The difference is that, in mechanism, the reaction product is amorphous until it is fully hydrated.Because its reaction product NaMgPO 4 hydrate is an indeterminate chemical formula, in this respect it is more similar to CSH.The reaction equations are as follows: MgOþKH2PO4þ5H2O¼KMgPO4�6H2O (1) MgOþNaH 2PO4þxH2O¼NaMgPO4�xH2O (2) Based on the consideration of biosafety, the phosphate reac- tants of MPC series bone cement can be potassium salt and so- dium salt.In addition, it is also necessary to consider the problems of high heat discharge, short curing time, and material failure.Compared with NaMgPO 4 system, KMgPO 4 system has a higher heat release and a longer curing time.
However, under the condition of conventional MgO (referring to MgO prepared below 1500�C), the curing time is fast (<3min), and the peak heat re- lease is as high as 45�C/g or even more. In the process of exploring the components of MPC, disalt hy- drogen phosphate was found to significantly reduce the heat re- lease of the system and delay the curing time.Among them, the reaction products of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO 4) system remained in a difficult state of solidification.Besides, al- though the product of the reaction involving Na2HPO 4 had a com- pressive strength of 55MPa carrying in air under normal Figure 5.Material implantation operation process and primary evaluation of femoral bone specimens.Material implantation in the critical-sized lateral femoral defect (A).The specimens of the femoral bone at 4 and 18weeks (B) and the corresponding images of X-ray (C).circle and square frame: the implanted MPC-based bone cements.8 | Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol.
11, rbae100 temperature and pressure, in the environment with water, so- dium hydroxide (NaOH) was generated in the product, which would readily dissolve in water, resulting in the dissociation of the system. In order to settle the excess sodium ions in the Na2HPO 4 system, the study adopted the addition of equal molar number of MgHPO 4�3H 2O.The results showed that MgHPO 4 may act as an intermediate reaction product after acid-base reaction in KMgPO 4 system, which on the one hand reduces the heat re- lease of the system and on the other hand shorts the curing time of the system.Adding a small amount of KH2PO4 to the system of Na2HPO 4 and MgHPO 4 not only limited the curing time, but also kept the heat release in an acceptable range.The final compo - nent was to replace 1/3 mass of Na2HPO 4 with KH2PO4 at a molar ratio of 3.4:1.The weakly basic MPC in this study solved the problem of heat release, but the problem of curing time was not be solved.
Considering the subsequent research works are going to solve the corresponding curing time problem with organic media as the carriers, this study more focuses on the problem of material fail- ure and mechanical decay in the early and later stages. The alka- line component reduced the content of soluble salt and the possibility of dissolution of the early component.Besides, in order to maintain mechanical stability in the later stage, the MPC substrate was combined with different contents of C3S and C2S in this study.The resulting composite cements were based on the mechanical growth lag of C3S and C2S, which effectively maintained the mechanical strength of MPC in the later stage.
According to the XRD results (Figure 1), with the increase of C3S content, the peak of NaMgPO 4 in the hydration products de- creased after 7days of 37�C saturated humidity water bath, and when 20% C3S was present in the MPC-based bone cement, the product showed a more obvious steamed bread-like dispersion peak. Similar to NaMgPO 4 products, C3S, C2S and NaMgPO 4 all had a formation process from the amorphous state to the definite crystal form.The XRD results showed that the conversion rate of NaMgPO 4 from amorphous product to definite crystal was faster than that of C3S and C2S to definite crystal hydrated cal- cium silicate.The apparent morphology of cement can help to understand its curing mechanism and strength source (Figure 2A).In general, the morphology of bone cement treated with 7days of saturated humidity at 37�C showed that the MPC substrate was hydrated to form a gel covering the MgO skeleton and the added CSC plate/ needle crystals [40, 41].
With the rapid increase of C3S content, Figure 6.

As for the MPC-based system, MPC achieved nearly no setting time increase and heat release decrease by increasing the LPR due to its acid- base reaction. Instead, the mechanical strength would decrease to a large degree.Accordingly, the LPR should be varied in each group, which is beneficial for slurry preparation and self-curing process as expected.Besides, because C3S powder has a high re- action activity, which will preferentially neutralize the reaction with hydrogen ions.Therefore, the addition of C3S further in- creased the reaction rate of the system, resulting in the initial setting time of the MPC-based bone cement being shortened (Supplementary Figure S2).While the hydration and hardening of bone cements was a slow process, the final setting time was ex- tended (Figure 2B).However, due to the very short interval be- tween the initial and final setting time of MPC substrate, it was almost negligible.
When the cross-linking and hardening of MPC was occurring, the dispersion of C3S and C2S broke the cross- linking and made the system in a malleable state with poor conti - nuity. If the stress failure occurred at this stage, the strength pro- vided by MPC substrate would be a huge disaster.Based on the rise of pH value, the reduced activity of MgO and the slow hydra - tion process of CSCs, the heat release was under con- trol (Figure 2C).In fact, it was found that when the content of C3S in the sys- tem increased, the MPC-based bone cements soaked in Tris-HCl buffer (Figure 3I) was more prone to hydration hardening than saturated humidity environment (Figure 2D).For MPC with higher MPC content and MPC/CSC-15, the intensity increase time was almost the same.
The results of ion release (Figure 3A–F) show that the MPC-based bone cements were relatively negative for the release of calcium and silicon elements, among which the MPC/CSC-35 was the most special, the release of Ca2þwas the highest among the four groups, and the release concentration of PO3− 4 was almost 0, showing that the high content of CSCs inhib - ited the degradation of MPC from the beginning. The continuous and slow increase of PO3− 4 concentration in MPC group indicated that its degradation was not restricted when CSCs were not Figure 7.H&E staining images (30×, 100×) of the specimen sections implanted the MPC-based bone cements at 4 and 18weeks.NB: newly formed bone.M: the MPC-based bone cements.White circle: edge of materials.10 | Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol.11, rbae100 added.
The MPC/CSC-15 and MPC/CSC-25 groups both showed the different trend of increasing first and then decreasing, indi- cating that PO3− 4 were released early and then redeposited, and CSCs could stabilize the degradation of MPC about 1month later. Moreover, PO3− 4 release could be inhibited by high content of CSCs and promote re-mineralization due to the pH adjustment and anionic antagonism.In addition, the release of Kþ, Naþand Mg2þwas nearly two orders of magnitude higher than other ions.The release curve of MPC/CSC-15 showed that the release curve of Naþand Kþwas more stable, while the release of Mg2þwas rel- atively delayed, indicating that a small amount of C3S could in- crease the degradation activity of the system, especially for the degradation of ‘struvite-like’ components, and the MgO in this study was relatively difficult to degrade.
In particular, the pH of MPC/CSC-35 gradually rose above 9.5, where Mg(OH) 2 was most readily deposited (Figure 3G), showing different dissolution char - acteristics. With the increase of C3S content, the initial degrada - tion rate increased rapidly, and then tended to be stable.Both pure MPC and excessive C3S would accelerate the early release of Mg2þ, and appropriate CSCs could better control the degradation rate of MPC system.Mass loss (Figure 3H) supported the activa - tion of MPC/CSC-15 for early degradation.With the increase of C3S content, the longer the soaking time, the more stable the system was (Figure 3I).Besides, the increase of C3S may increase the pH of the system, thus delaying the time of complete hydra - tion and hardening of the composite system.
And then, the hy- dration hardening process of CSCs was accompanied by volume expansion and induces the deposition of HA [24, 44], which made up for the loss of strength caused by the reduction of density af- ter MPC degradation. It was worth mentioning that in the 12- week immersion experiment, except for the mechanical decay of MPC group after 8weeks, the mechanical strength of the other groups added with CSCs all increased steadily.In particular, the compressive strength of the composite system showed the fast- est growth and the maximum value at 12weeks in MPC/CSC-25.It might be that the hydrated crystals of CSCs fill the cross-linked network of MPC, and the excess MgO together forms the skeleton of the MPC-based bone cement, thus increasing the mechani - cal strength.
As for the biomimetic mineralization ability of the system (Figure 4), the authors found that when MPC/CSC-25 was added to the MPC system, the bone cement showed better apparent mineralization performance, which was conducive to the induc - tion of bone formation in vivo. Animal femur condylar bone de- fect repair model confirmed that the addition of C3S and C2S could slow down the material degradation of the MPC system.By Figure 8.Masson staining images (30×, 100×) of the specimen sections implanted the MPC-based bone cements at 4 and 18weeks.NB: newly formed bone.M: the MPC-based bone cements.White circle: edge of materials.Regenerative Biomaterials, 2024, Vol.11, rbae100 | 11 comprehensive comparison of all indexes, 15–25 wt.% calcium silicate content is more beneficial to regulate the physicochemi - cal and biological properties of the system.
Since CSCs had the higher density than MPC, when com- pounded with MPC, it would present a more significant density contrast in images of X-ray (Figure 5C). According to the process of degradation in vivo (Figure 6A), reconstructed images of the fe- mur specimens presented an obvious degradation of MPC at 18weeks without CSCs.In addition, comparing Figures 7 and 8, the difference of degradation rate between the MPC skeleton and crosslinked phase was significant, which might origin from the difference of solubility product constant (Ksp) of MgO, magne - sium hydroxide (Mg(OH) 2) and struvite-like products (MgO: �10−25, Mg(OH) 2: 10−12�10−11, NH 4MgPO 4: �10−13, KMgPO 4: �10−11, NaMgPO 4: �10−10) [45].In fact, the rate of degradation depended mainly on the activity of MgO and the type of ‘struvite’, NaMgPO 4 was degraded faster than KMgPO 4, and active MgO was more easily combined with water to form Mg(OH) 2.
Therefore, the degradation structure of MPC substrate was actually able to control the preferential dissolution of its skeleton or the prefer - ential degradation of cross-linked crystals by regulating the ac- tivity of MgO and types of phosphates. Quantitative data (Figure 6B and C) showed that MPC/CSC-15 could increase bone formation accompanied by reasonable material degradation, which still maintained the densification as well (Figure 6A).What’s more, as histological staining images presented, although the MPC/CSC-15 had the ability to promote peripheral bone for- mation, the poor osseous integration between material and bone defect was easily observed (Figures 7 and 8), indicating that Mg2þ-rich environment (>20 mM) was unfavorable to osteoclastic synergistic process [46].Conclusion In summary, this study determined an MPC-based composite im- plant by adding appropriate CSC component and ratio.
The MPC- based bone cement obtained by combining CSCs with MPC of this composition has the characteristics of low heat release and expected self-curing process. Besides, the addition of CSCs will improve early corrosion and provide appreciable biological activ - ity for the MPC-based bone cement, and also stabilize the system avoiding collapse caused by degradation in the later stage of the composite system.It is reasonable to consider that such MPC/ CSCs composite bone cement may become an excellent clinical minimally invasive treatment of bone defects after improving the injection performance.Funding This work was supported by the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LZ22E020002), the Zhejiang Provincial Basic Research for Public Welfare Funds (LGF22E030002) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82172419, 82101649).Supplementary data Supplementary data are available at Regenerative Biomaterials online.Conflicts of interest statement.
