However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of VE ongrowth performance and ﬂesh quality in sub-adult grass carp ( Ctenopharyngodon idella ).A total of 450 ﬁsh (713.53 ±1.50 g) were randomly divided into six treatment groups (three replicates per treatment) and fed for nine weeks with different experimental diets (dietary lipid 47.8 g/kg) that contained differentlevels of VE (5.44, 52.07, 96.85, 141.71, 185.66, and 230.12 mg/kg diet, supplemented as dl- a-tocopherol acetate).Notably, the treatment groups that were fed with dietary VE ranging from 52.07 to 230.12 mg/ kg diet showed improvement in the percent weight gain, special growth rate, and feed ef ﬁciency of grass carp.
Moreover, the treatment groups supplemented with dietary VE level of 141.71, 185.66, and 230.12 mg/kg diet showed enhancement in crude protein, lipid, and a-tocopherol contents in the muscle, and the dietary levels of VE ranging from 52.07 to 141.71 mg/kg diet improved muscle pH 24hand shear force but reduced muscle cooking loss in grass carp. Furthermore, appropriate levels of VE (52.07 to96.85 mg/kg diet) increased the muscle polyunsaturated fatty acid content in grass carp.Dietary VE also increased the mRNA levels of fatty acid synthesis-related genes, including fas,scd-1 ,fad,elovl ,srebp1 , ppar g,a n d lxra, and up-regulated the expression of SREBP-1 protein.However, dietary VE decreased the expression of fatty acid decomposition-related genes, including hsl,cpt1,acox1 ,a n d ppara, and endo- plasmic reticulum stress-related genes, including perk,ire1,atf6,eif2a,atf4,xbp1 ,chop , and grp78 , and down-regulated the expression of p-PERK, p-IRE1, ATF6, and GRP78 proteins.
In conclusion, dietary VEincreased muscle fatty acid synthesis, which may be partly associated with the alleviation of endo- plasmic reticulum stress, and ultimately improves ﬁshﬂesh quality. Moreover, the VE requirements for sub-adult grass carp (713.53 to 1590.40 g) were estimated to be 124.9 and 122.73 mg/kg diet based onpercentage weight gain and muscle shear force, respectively.©2024 The Authors.Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.on behalf of KeAi Communications Co.Ltd.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by- nc-nd/4.0/ ).1.Introduction Fish are an important source of animal protein and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and do- cosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for human beings.Both EPA and DHA have been found to prevent cardiovascular diseases and hyper- tension ( Ruyter et al., 2022 ;Xie et al., 2022 ).The composition of muscle UFA in ﬁsh is affected by dietary factors.

chrysops ), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss ), and yellow perch ( Perca ﬂavescens )(Baron et al., 2013 ;Bharadwaj et al., 2010 ;Twibell et al., 2001 ). Vitamin E (VE), which includes tocopherols and tocotrienols, is a fat-soluble nutrient ( Peh et al., 2016 ).Dietary VE has been shown to notably increase the PUFA content in raw and cooked golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus )(Zhang et al., 2021 ).A previous study has re- ported that long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) syn- thesis is greater in freshwater ﬁsh than in marine ﬁsh (Sun et al., 2020 ).However, there have been limited studies on the effect of VE on PUFA content in the muscles of freshwater ﬁsh, and this re- quires further investigation.Fatty acid composition is closely related to its synthesis, trans- port, and catabolism.
Transporter proteins (such as fatty acid transporter [CD36] and fatty acid binding protein [FABP]), lipogenic enzymes (such as fatty acid synthase [FAS] and acetyl-CoA carboxylase [ACC]), and lipolytic enzymes (such as adipose triglyceride lipase [ATGL], hormone-sensitive lipase [HSL], and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase [ACOX]) are involved in fatty acid meta-bolism ( Febbraio et al., 2001 ;Lampidonis et al., 2011 ;Yao et al., 2023 ). Moreover, fatty acid desaturase (FAD) and fatty acid elon- gase (ELOVL) also play vital roles in LC-PUFA synthesis ( Xie et al., 2021 ).In addition, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), liver X receptor (LXR), and sterol regulatory element- binding protein 1 (SREBP1) are important transcription factors that regulate the expression of fatty acid metabolism-related genes (Kim and Spiegelman, 1996 ;Lee et al., 2003 ;Xiao et al., 2010 ).
Despite several reports published on studying the effect of dietary VE on fatty acid metabolism in ﬁsh liver, to date, there has been no study reporting the effect of VE on fatty acid metabolism in ﬁsh muscle. Dietary VE increased the mRNA levels of HSLand decreased the mRNA levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 ( CPT1 ),PPAR g, lipoprotein lipase, and FASin the liver of hybrid grouper ( \Epi- nephelus fuscoguttatus /C2_E.lanceolatus )(Liang et al., 2021 ).In golden pompano, dietary VE decreased the gene expression of FAS, CPT1 , and PPARa, but increased the expression of FABP ,FAD, and ELOVL in the liver ( Zhang et al., 2021 ).However, there may be some differences between the fatty acid metabolism in muscle and liver tissues.Lipases are most highly expressed in the liver, whereas FAD and ELOVL are most highly expressed in the skeletal muscle of gilthead sea bream ( Sparus aurata L.) (Benedito-Palos et al., 2014 ).
Therefore, the effect of VE on muscle fatty acid metabolism may differ from that on the liver, which requires further investigation. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a major role in fatty acid synthesis, particularly PUFA.ER stress occurs when unfolded pro- teins accumulate inside the ER, leading to abnormal fatty acid synthesis ( Basseri and Austin, 2012 ;Scriven et al., 2007 ).A previous study found that ER stress induced by copper leads to fatty acid metabolism disorders in the liver of yellow cat ﬁsh (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco )(Song et al., 2016 ).During ER stress, the body triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway to relieve the stress.UPR is predominantly controlled by the activating tran- scription factor 6 (ATF6), protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) ( Almanza et al., 2019 ).
Previous studies reported that apoptin-induced ER stress increased the expression of IRE1 aprotein and decreased the mRNA levels of ACC,FAS, and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 ( SCD-1 ) in HepG2 cells ( Zhu et al., 2021 ). However, whether VE regulates muscle fatty acid synthesis by relieving ER stress has not yet been reported.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important factors that induce ER stress ( Almanza et al., 2019 ).VE is a potent lipid-soluble antioxidant (Peh et al., 2016 ) that has been reported to reduce ROS content in the muscle of zebra ﬁsh (Danio rerio )(Liu et al., 2020 ).In humanmelanoma cell lines, d-vitamin E tocotrienols are known to activate UPR ( Montagnani Marelli et al., 2016 ).Thus, VE may regulate ER stress; however, this requires further investigation.In the current study, we investigated the effects of VE on the growth performance and ﬂesh quality (especially fatty acid composition) in sub-adult grass carp and the possible underlying mechanisms.
Furthermore, we investigated, for the ﬁrst time, the relationship between VE and muscle ER to provide theoretical support for the intrinsic mechanisms by which VE regulates fatty acid synthesis (especially PUFA) in ﬁsh. Finally, we estimated the VE requirements of the sub-adult grass carp based on different in- dicators that could be used as production guidance to improve the development of grass carp culture.2.Materials and methods 2.1.Animal ethics statement The Animal Care Committee of Sichuan Agricultural University approved the experimental procedures.The guidelines for labora- tory animal care and use of the Animal Nutrition Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University (permit no.YK-2020214011) were strictly followed.2.2.Animal management and experimental diets The basal diet, referred to as the semi-puri ﬁed diet used by Jiang et al.(2020) andPan et al.(2017) , is shown in Table 1 .The fatty acid composition of the basic diet is shown in Table 2 .

The ﬁnal VE contents in the diets were determined by the Guangzhou Huibiao Testing Technology Center (Guangzhou, China) according to Determination of vitamin E in feeds (China National Standard, 2008 ). The dietary VE in different experimental diets were found to be 5.44 (un-supplemented con- trol), 52.07, 96.85, 141.71, 185.66, and 230.12 mg/kg (named VE5.44, VE52.07, VE96.85, VE141.71, VE185.66, and VE230.12), respectively.The diets were prepared using the method described by Mai et al.(2009) .Brie ﬂy, the ingredients were ground into a ﬁne powder and collected after passing through a 300 mm sieve.Oil and water were added to the premixed dry material and mixed evenly.The mixture was squeezed through an extruder with a mold and air- dried at room temperature (25 ±5/C14C).According to Wang et al.(2016) , the diets were broken up, sifted into pellets, and stored at/C020/C14C.2.3.Feeding trial Allﬁsh were purchased from Deyang, China.
They were accli- mated for four weeks under experimental conditions, and then fed with 5.44 mg VE/kg diet for two weeks. Thereafter, a total of 450ﬁsh (initial average weight of 713.53 ±1.50 g) were randomly assigned into 18 experimental net cages (1.4 m /C21.4 m/C21.4 m) (25 ﬁsh in each cage).The experiment was divided into six treatment groups (25 ﬁsh per group, three repetitions per treatment).All net cages were located in outdoor freshwater ponds, and microporous aeration was used throughout the experiment.Each net cage was allocated a 100-cm diameter disc with 1 mm gauze at the bottom to collect the uneaten feed.The average water temperature, pH, dis- solved oxygen, and total ammonia were 28 ±3 /C14C, 7.0 ±0.3, /C216.0 mg/L, and <0.05 mg/L, respectively.During the experiment, 20% of the water was exchanged daily.Water quality was measuredevery three days using a multiparameter water quality sonde (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH, USA).
Fish were fed with the experimental diets four times daily at 07:00, 11:00, 15:00, and 19:00. After 30 min of feeding, the uneaten feed was collected, dried, and weighed to calculate feed intake (FI) as described by Xue et al.(2004) .Allﬁsh were subjected to natural light conditions, which consisted of approximately 12 h/12 h light and darkness.2.4.Sample collection After the nine-week feeding trial, the ﬁsh in each net cage were fasted for 24 h and anesthetized with benzocaine (50 mg/L) (Sigma- Aldrich, USA).The ﬁsh were then counted and weighed to calculate ﬁnal body weight (FBW), percent weight gain (PWG), special growth rate (SGR), and feed ef ﬁciency (FE).Three ﬁsh per cage were randomly chosen and used to calculate the condition factor (CF), viscerosomatic index (VSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI), and slaughter rate.
Blood samples were taken from the caudal vein using syringes and then centrifuged at 1700 /C2gat 4/C14C for 10 min, and the serum samples were obtained and stored at /C020/C14C for subsequent analysis of biochemical parameters. The ﬁsh were dissected, weighed after removing the head, tail, and ﬁns, and then the left side muscle without skin (the trunk musculature cross-section at the level before and after the dorsal ﬁn) was collected, immediately stored in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at /C080/C14C.The remaining carcasses were cooked until the remaining muscle could be removed from the ﬁsh bone, and the bone was weighed to calculate meat yield ( Wu et al., 2022 ).In addition, three ﬁsh per treatment were randomly selected, 1 cm3of left side muscle was cut and preserved in 4% paraformaldehyde for muscle histological analysis.2.5.Sample analysis2.5.1.Muscle physicochemical indices Muscle lactate (Kit No.A019-2-1) and hydroxyproline contents (Kit No.
A030-2-1) were analyzed using kits obtained from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China). For cooking loss analysis, the meat samples were weighed, packaged in sealed plastic bags, and cooked in a water bath at 70 /C14C for 20 min.After cooking, samples were cooled to room temperature (25 ±5/C14C) with tap water and weighed again.The cooking loss was determined by comparing the percentage of weight of meat samples before and after cooking.The samples (cut into 1.5 cm wide and 1.0 cm deep) were then placed in a shear box (Instron, model 4411, Kramer shear box) to measure the relative shear force ( Brinker and Reiter, 2011 ).The cutting direction of the blade was kept perpendicular to the muscle ﬁber.The shear force value was calculated as the average of the peak force measurements on each sample in newton (N).Muscle pH was measured at 24 h postmortem using a calibrated pH probe (Testo 205 pH meter; Testo AG, Lenzkirch, Germany).2.5.2.
Muscle nutrition composition Moisture content was measured by drying the samples at 105/C14C to a constant weight in a ventilation drying oven. The crude protein and lipid content were measured using the Kjeldahl method (N/C26.25) and petroleum ether extraction, respectively.The fatty acid composition of the muscle was measured using gas chroma- tography.Muscle lipids were extracted using the chloroform- methanol method ( Folch et al., 1957 ).After saponi ﬁcation with 0.5 mol/L methanolic potassium hydroxide, fatty acids were methylated using a 14% boron tri ﬂuoride-methanol solution, as described by Zengin et al.(2013) .The samples were loaded into GC- 2010 Plus gas chromatography system (Shimadzu, Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), which was equipped with an SP-2560 (100 m /C20.25 mm inside diameter and 0.2 mmﬁlm thickness) capillary column andTable 2 Fatty acid composition of the basic diet (% total fatty acids).

Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas and was maintained at a 1.8 mL/min rate. The injected sample volume was 1mL.A 37-fatty acid methyl ester mix (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA) was used as an external standard, and the results were expressed as percentages of total fatty acids.The VE content in the muscle was determined by the Guangzhou Huibiao Testing Tech- nology Center (Guangzhou, China) according to National Standard for Safety Determination of Vitamin A, D, and E in food (China National Standard, 2016 ).2.5.3.Serum biochemical parameters, muscle fatty acid metabolism indices, and antioxidant status Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (Kit No.A113-1-1), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (Kit No.A112-1-1), total cholesterol (TC) (Kit No.A111-1-1), and triglyceride (TG) (Kit No.A110-1-1) levels in the serum were analyzed using kits from the Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China).TheSCD-1 (Kit No.YJ660716) and ACC (Kit No.
YJ503918) in the muscle were analyzed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits from Shanghai Enzyme-Linked Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).The muscle samples were homogenized with saline at a ratio of 1:9 (wt/vol), the supernatant was then collected by centrifugation at 1700 /C2gat 4 /C14C for 10 min and used for parameters analysis.Malondialdehyde (MDA) (Kit No.A003-1) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Kit No.A004-1), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) (Kit No.A001-1), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (Kit No.A005-1), and protein carbonyl (PC) (Kit No.A087-1) were analyzed using kits from the Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China).ROS (Kit No.S0033S) were analyzed using a kit from Beyotime Biotechnology (Shanghai, China).2.6.Histopathological analysis The muscle samples were ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde (4% concentration), then embedded in paraf ﬁn, dehydrated with ethanol, and sectioned (5 mm thin).
Sections were stained with Oil Red O and light microscopy images were captured using Nikon TS100 microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Percentage areas were analyzed using ImageJ (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7.Real-time quantitative PCR Total RNA was isolated from muscle tissues using RNAios Plus (TaKaRa, Japan), as previously described ( Deng et al., 2016 ).The integrity and purity of the total RNA were evaluated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric analysis (A260/280).Subsequently, the RNA of each sample was reverse transcribed using PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Japan).Real-time qPCR was performed using SYBR (Aidlab Biotechnologies Co., Ltd.).Primers for the genes were designed according to se- quences in GenBank.The real-time quantitative PCR primer se-quences are shown in Table S1 .b-Actin was used as the reference gene.
The relative gene expression levels were calculated by using the 2/C0DDCTmethod ( Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ). 2.8.Western blot Primary antibodies against PPAR a(Cat.No.A18252, 1:1000), PPAR g(Cat.No.A11183, 1:1000), SREBP1 (Cat.No.A15586, 1:1000), and ATF6 (Cat.No.A0202, 1:1000) were purchased from AB clonalTechnology (Wuhan, China).The glucose regulatory protein 78 (GRP78) (Cat.No.AF5366, 1:1000), p-PERK (Cat.No.AF4499, 1:1000; Ser1096), and p-IRE1 (Cat.No.AF7150, 1:1000; Ser724) were purchased from Af ﬁnity BioReagents (Golden, Colo, USA).HRP Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (Cat.No.AS014, 1:2000) from ABclonal Technology (Wuhan, China) was used as the secondary antibody.b- Actin (Cat.No.AF7018, 1:1000) was used as the control protein and was purchased from Af ﬁnity BioReagents (Golden, Colo, USA).These antibodies were checked and cross-reacted with grass carp proteins of interest.Western blot was performed as described by Yang et al.(2014) .
Tissue protein extraction was performed using radio immunopre- cipitation assay lysis buffer. The proteins were separated on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-glycine polyacrylamide gel, transferred to methanol-activated polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes, blocked with blocking solution for 1 h, and washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST).Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4/C14C, washed with TBST, and then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room tem- perature (25 ±5/C14C).The intensities of the protein bands were quanti ﬁed using ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).The amount of target protein was normalized byb-actin.2.9.Calculation of growth performance and statistical analysis PWG, FE, CF, and VSI were computed using standard formulas based on our previous study ( Wu et al., 2022 ).

However, there were differences in PWG, SGR, and FE among grass carp at differentgrowth stages. At different levels of dietary VE supplementation, PWG, SGR, and FE percentage in juvenile grass carp (11.2 to 20.93 g) were found to be 103.28 to 185.90, 1.26 to 1.88, and 0.45 to 0.56, respectively ( Li et al., 2014 ).While PWG, SGR, and FE percent in young grass carp (BW ¼266.39 to 1026.63 g) ranged from 222.75 to 285.48, from 1.67 to 1.93, and from 0.62 to 0.73, respectively, at different dietary VE levels ( Pan et al., 2017 ).Previous studies found that the PWG, SGR, and FE in sub-adult grass carp fed with different amounts of dietary proteins were from 62.98 to 91.34, from 0.81 to 1.08, and from 0.46 to 0.61, respectively ( Dong et al., 2022 ).
In the present study, the PWG,SGR, and FE in the sub-adult grass carp (713.53 to 1590.40 g) were found to be in the range from 74.32 to 122.87, from 0.88 to 1.27, and from 0.46 to 0.58, respectively, at different VE sup- plementation, which were similar to those in other studies on sub-adult grass carp with varied dietary pro ﬁles. Furthermore, CF and organ weight indices are important indicators of animal growth ( Du and Turchini, 2022 ).Our results showed that dietary VE increased the CF, VSI, and HSI in sub-adult grass carp.How- ever, VE did not affect the CF and HSI in cobia ( Zhou et al., 2013 ), or the VSI and HSI in puffer ﬁsh (Takifugu obscurus )(Cheng et al., 2018 ).This difference might be due to the different experimental conditions and ﬁsh species.In addition, we found that high levels of VE (exceeding 96.85 mg/kg diet) reduced the growth performance of grass carp.Similar results were found in golden pompanos ( Zhang et al., 2021 )a n dt i l a p i a( Qiang et al., 2019 ).
This might be related to the antagonistic effect of VE on vitamin A. It has been found that dietary high levels of vitamin A reduced a-tocopherol levels in pig liver tissue ( Ayuso et al., 2015 ;Olivares et al., 2009 ).However, there have been limited studies on the effect of dietary high VE levels on vitamin A metabolism in ﬁsh, and this requires further investigation.Meat production is an important quality parameter for many cultured animals and the proximate composition of ﬁllets re ﬂects their nutritional value (Grigorakis, 2007 ;Lv et al., 2021 ).In the present study, dietary VE increased meat yield, muscle crude protein, and crude lipid content in sub-adult grass carp.Previous studies have shown that VE improved meat quality by increasing antioxidant ca- pacity.The muscle crude protein and lipid contents of tilapia Fig.1.Oil red O staining in the muscle of sub-adult grass carp (200 /C2magni ﬁcation).The red part is the lipid droplet (black arrows).

VE prevents the oxidation of membrane phospholipids, thereby maintaining the integrity of muscle cell membranes ( Descalzo and Sancho, 2008 ), which could account for the elevated meat quality associated with VE supplementation.

Serum TG, TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels may re ﬂect the fatty acid metabolism in animals ( Yuan et al., 2016 ). In this study, we found that the dietary VE increased serum TG, TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels.However, di- etary VE reduced serum TG and TC content in tilapia ( Qiang et al., 2019 ) and serum TC and LDL content in hybrid groupers ( Huang et al., 2022 ).The reason for this result may be the effect of different species, but there are no other studies on the effect of VE on the serum lipid composition of grass carp, thus, it needs to be further investigated.FABP is an important fatty acid transporter.In this study, dietary VE increased muscle FABP mRNA levels.Simi- larly, dietary VE increased the mRNA levels of liver FABP in tilapia (Qiang et al., 2019 ) and golden pompanos ( Zhang et al., 2021 ).These results suggest that VE could regulate fatty acid transport, but itvaries from species to species.
CD36 is an important fatty acid transporter on the cell membrane that activates mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in the muscles ( Pepino et al., 2014 ). In the present study, dietary VE decreased the muscle CD36 mRNA levels.How- ever, limited studies have investigated the effect of VE on CD36 expression in ﬁsh muscles.A study in rabbits found that VE inhibited the increase in CD36 mRNA levels in the aorta ( Ozer et al., 2006 ).Therefore, we further studied the effect of VE on fatty acid decomposition in the muscles.Fatty acid catabolism begins with the breakdown of lipids into fatty acids, followed by b-oxidation of fatty acids, which could be catalyzed by HSL, ATGL, CPT1, and ACOX, respectively ( Reubsaet et al., 1988 ;Schreurs et al., 2010 ).In the present study, dietary VE decreased HSL,ATGL ,CPT1a ,CPT1b ,ACOX1a , and ACOX1b mRNA levels in ﬁsh muscles.However, limited studies have investigated the mechanisms by which VE affects fatty acid catabolism.
Dietary oxidized ﬁsh oil has been shown to increase the mRNA level of CPT1 in the mid-intestine of Wuchang bream ( Megalobrama amblyce- phala ) compared to dietary ﬁsh oil ( Song et al., 2019 ). VE can inhibit lipid peroxidation in aquatic feeds ( Wang et al., 2015 ).Therefore, we speculated that dietary VE might inhibit fatty acid decomposi- tion through its antioxidant capacity, which requires further investigation.Similarly, dietary VE reduced the mRNA levels of HSL and CPT1 in the liver of golden pompano ( Zhang et al., 2021 ) and the mRNA levels of liver CPT1 in hybrid grouper ( Liang et al., 2021 ).These results suggested that dietary VE inhibits fatty acid catabo- lism.From these results, we speculated that dietary VE might in- crease the PUFA content in muscle by inhibiting fatty acid oxidation.However, PUFA content is not only related to fatty acid decomposition but also to fatty acid synthesis.Therefore, we studied the effect of VE on fatty acid synthesis in the muscles.
FAS, ACC, SCD-1, FAD, and ELOVL play important roles in the catalysis of fatty acid synthesis ( Brownsey et al., 2006 ;Flowers and Ntambi, 2008 ;Liu et al., 2010 ). The present study showed that di- etary VE increased the mRNA levels of FAS,SCD-1 ,FAD,ELOVL2 , and ELOVL5 in muscle tissue.Similarly, dietary VE increased FAD and ELOVL mRNA levels in the liver of golden pompanos ( Zhang et al., 2021 ).However, only a few studies have investigated the mecha- nisms by which VE affects fatty acid synthesis.The metabolite of VE, tocopherol quinone, is an essential enzyme cofactor of FAD ( Infante, 1999 ).Therefore, we speculated that dietary VE might promote PUFA synthesis through its metabolites.However, dietary VE Fig.5.Effects of vitamin E on the relative protein expressions of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins in the muscle of sub-adult grass carp.(A) Western blots for p-PERK (Ser1096), p-IRE1 (Ser724), ATF6 and GRP78.

However, the detailed mechanisms require further investigation. These results suggested that dietary VE promoted fatty acid syn- thesis.However, further investigation on how VE regulates fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid decomposition is necessary.Fatty acid metabolism-related gene transcription levels are regulated by multiple signaling molecules such as the SREBP and PPAR families, and LXR ( Horton et al., 2002 ;Reubsaet et al., 1988 ).In our experiment, we found that dietary VE promoted the mRNA levels of SREBP1 ,PPARg, and LXRa, and the protein levels of SREBP1 but reduced the mRNA levels of PPARain muscle tissue of grass carp.Similarly, VE reduced the mRNA level of PPARain the liver of golden pompanos ( Zhang et al., 2021 ).These results suggested that dietary VE might promote fatty acid synthesis and inhibit fatty acid decomposition partly through SREBP1, PPAR a,P P A R g, and LXR a.
However, there are limited studies on the mechanisms by which VE affects transcription factors related to fatty acid metabolism. Me- tabolites of VE could bind to the ligand of the transcription factor PPAR g(Ariﬁet al., 2023 ).Therefore, we speculated that dietary VE might regulate fatty acid metabolism through its metabolites, which requires further investigation.4.3.The effect of dietary VE in alleviating muscle ER stress in grass carp is partly associated with its antioxidant capacity The ER is an important organelle for fatty acid synthesis (Bogdanovic et al., 2015 ).ER stress is a physiological and patho- logical process that occurs when the homeostatic state of ER is disrupted.PERK, IRE1, ATF6, and GRP78, and their regulated downstream signaling molecules of eIF2 a, CHOP, ATF4, and XBP1 are the main regulator of ER stress ( Kimata and Kohno, 2011 ).
In our study, dietary VE reduced p-PERK, p-IRE1, ATF6, and GRP78 protein levels and PERK, IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, eIF2 a, CHOP, ATF4, and XBP1 mRNA levels in the muscle, suggesting that dietary VE could alle-viate ER stress via the UPR signaling pathway. Similarly, dietary VE reduced p-eIF2 protein levels in the aortas of rabbits that were fed a high-cholesterol diet ( Bozaykut et al., 2020 ).Dietary VE inhibits muscle ER stress, which is likely due to its antioxidant capacity.Oxidative stress is an important trigger for ER stress ( Almanza et al., 2019 ).A study using the human lung epithelial cell line A549 found that oxidative damage increased the levels of UPR-related proteins (Wang et al., 2019 ).VE is an important antioxidant in ﬁsh muscle (Pazos et al., 2005 ).Our study found that dietary VE increased the a-tocopherol content, and T-SOD and GST activities, and decreased muscle MDA, PC, and ROS levels, suggesting that dietary VE reducedoxidative stress in grass carp muscle.
Therefore, dietary VE can alleviate ER stress in grass carp muscles, partly through its anti- oxidant capacity. In addition, we found that dietary high doses of VE promoted ER stress, which might be related to the fact that excess VE promotes oxidative stress.Notably, high dietary levels of VE supplementation with other antioxidants (vitamin C and sele- nium) were found to reduce oxidative stress ( Hamre et al., 1997 ; Naderi et al., 2019 ).4.4.The VE requirements of sub-adult grass carp The VE requirements for sub-adult grass carp by quadratic regression analysis of PWG and muscle shear force were 124.9 and 122.73 mg/kg diet, respectively ( Fig.6 ).These values were slightly higher than that for young grass carp (266.39 to 1026.63 g) (116.2 mg/kg diet) ( Pan et al., 2017 ).This difference might be related to the crude lipid content of the diets.Dietary crude lipid content affects VE requirements.
In tilapia, the VE requirement was 76.1 mg/kg diet at high dietary lipid levels (130 g/kg), which was higher than that of 43.2 mg/kg diet requirement at low dietary lipid levels (60 g/kg) ( Jiang et al., 2020 ). The crude lipid of this experi- mental diet (47.8 g/kg) was higher than that in young grass carp (33.04 g/kg) ( Pan et al., 2017 ).5.Conclusion In summary, dietary VE improved growth performance, meat quality, and muscle PUFA content in sub-adult grass carp.Furthermore, the increase in muscle PUFA content in grass carp on supplementation with appropriate levels of dietary VE (52.07 to 96.85 mg/kg diet) might be associated with increased fatty acid synthesis-related genes and proteins, decreased fatty acid decomposition-related genes and proteins, and decreased ER stress, which might be related to the antioxidant properties of VE.This provides a novel possible molecular mechanism for the use of VE to improve the meat quality of grass carp.
In addition, the VE requirements for sub-adult grass carp based on the PWG and muscle shear force were estimated to be 124.9 and 122.73 mg/kg diet, respectively.
