As with the other 5 reports in this series, which focused on iodine, folate, zinc, iron, and vitamin A, this B12 report was developed with the assistance of an expert panel (BOND B12 EP) and other experts who provided information during a consultation. The experts reviewed the existing literature in depth in order to consolidate existing relevant information on the biology of B12, including known and possible effects of insufficiency, and available and potential biomarkers of status.Unlike the situation for the other 5 nutrients reviewed during the BOND project, there has been relatively little previous attention paid to B12 status and its biomarkers, so this report is a landmark in terms of the consolidation and interpretation of the available information on B12 nutrition.Historically, most focus has been on diagnosis and treatment of clinical symptoms of B12 deficiency, which result primarily from pernicious anemia or strict vegetarianism.
More recently, we have become aware of the high prevalence of B12 insufficiency in populations consuminglowamountsofanimal-sourcefoods,whichcanbedetectedwith ≥1serumbiomarkerbutpresentsthenew challenge of identifying functional consequences that may require public health interventions.

First published online 0, 2018; doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxy201. 1995S isnowrecognizedthatthereisahighprevalenceofdeficiencyin many population groups, especially those with lower incomes.Worldwide,the current challenges are to improve the definition of deficiency and to identify the functional consequences of subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), which is far more prevalent than clinically evident severe deficiency.Toaddressthesechallenges,dependablebiomarkersofstatus and tools for measuring exposure, function, and the effects of interventions are needed.In addition, valid approaches to interpret and deploy these measurements are needed that can be utilized in various settings.This review covers the relevant aspects of cobalamin biology, exposure, health impact, and assessment,including the value and technical aspects of current and new approaches to assessment.
Historical Overview The discovery of B12 required skills from multiple disciplines, including clinical medicine, chemistry, nutrition, crystallogra- phy,microbiology,and pharmacy,and resulted in several Nobel Prize awards. This interesting story has been described by Chanarin ( 1) among others.Text Box 1 outlines a brief history of B12.Text Box 1 A brief history of B12 The initial discovery resulted from the need to find a cause and treatment of pernicious anemia, first described by Thomas Addison in 1849 ( 2).A cure was discovered in 1926 when consumption of lightlycookedliverresultedincorrectionofanemiaand preventionofdeath,althoughatthetimeitwasbelieved that proteins and iron in the liver were the curative factors (3).In the late 1940s, 2 groups announced the discovery of a new vitamin, purified and crystallized from liver, that inducedandmaintainedremissionofperniciousanemia (4).
The structure of the vitamin was solved in 1956 by Dorothy Hodgkin, an X-ray crystallographer ( 5). B12 was synthesized in 1973 by Robert Woodward ( 6).William Castle summarized his research in 1929 showingthattheunderlyingcauseofperniciousanemia involved lack of a gastric IF; gastric juice from healthy individuals substantially reduced the amount of liver needed to treat pernicious anemia ( 7).SCCD characterized by B12 depletion emerged as a significant public health problem as evidenced by bio- chemical indications of deficiency rather than anemia or clinical symptoms such as neuropathy ( 8).The prevalence of SCCD has generated interest in the development, application, and testing of biomarkers of B12 status during the past 20–30 y.Although serum cobalamin concentration was and is still used as the main status indicator, it is becoming more common to utilize 2–4 biomarkers simulta- neously, or 2–4 biomarkers combined, especially in population status surveys and research ( 9).
The highest prevalence of abnormal B12 status biomarkers is found in: ◦individuals and populations that have a low con- sumption of animal source foods ◦the elderlyThe current challenge is to interpret the biomarker values, apply valid cutoffs, and use the information correctly as a guide to appropriate interventions. Chemistry and Biology of B12 B12 and B12 analogs Cobalamins are members of a family of cobalt-containing compounds found in nature and called corrinoids.In addition to cobalamins, the corrinoid family includes cobamides and cobinamides, which are chemically modified analogs of the cobalamins.
The general cobalamin molecule is a complex, organometallic compound that consists of 1) a planar corrin ring with a cobalt atom coordinated in the center, and 2) a ribose-3-phosphate-dimethylbenzimidazole structure that extends below the plane of the corrin ring.Covalently bound to thecobaltatomandextendingabovethecorrinringisavariable ligand group that distinguishes the various supplemental and active forms of the vitamin. Possible ligands include cyano and hydroxyl, which constitute forms of B12 commonly used in dietary supplements (cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin), and methyl and 5′-deoxyadenosyl, which constitute active cofactor forms of the B12 in cells (methylcobalamin and 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin).B12 analogs are found in circu- lation (10) and in feces ( 11).The sources of B12 analogs may be diet or gut bacteria.However, it is unclear how B12 analogs are absorbed at the intestinal level, or whether they have biological activity or inhibit B12-dependent reactions.
B12 absorption and intestinal transport Cobalamins are absorbed by an active physiologic process and by passive diffusion. In contrast to the physiologic absorptive process,B12 absorptionby passivediffusionoccurs throughout theabsorptivesurfaceofthegastrointestinaltract.Only ∼1–2% of an oral dose is absorbed passively, and thus this represents only a small fraction of overall B12 absorption, except when B12 is consumed in supraphysiologic supplemental doses (>50µg) (1).Passive absorption of B12 can also occur in mucous membranes,including those in the mouth and the nose (12).In the receptor-mediated active process ( Figure 1 ), B12 absorption from first ingestion by mouth to appearance in the circulation takes 3–4 h to complete.The essentials of B12 absorption are outlined in Text Box 2 .Text Box 2 Essentials of B12 absorption B12 in the stomach Dietary B12 is released from protein in the stomach by the action of gastric enzymes facilitated by the low pH of the stomach.
◦Low gastric pH is maintained by the production of hydrochloric acid from the gastric parietal cells. ◦The parietal cells also produce IF.After release from food, B12 is bound to salivary R-binder (haptocorrin).The R-B12 complex and IF then travel to the upper small intestine, where the higher pH causes release of B12 from haptocorrin,and haptocorrin is then digested by pancreatic trypsin.1996S Supplement FIGURE 1 Digestionandabsorptionofdietarycobalamins.Inthereceptor-mediatedactiveprocessforB12absorption,dietaryB12isreleased in the stomach and bound to salivary R-binder.The R-B12 complex and IF are transported to the ileum where B12 is released from the R-binder and binds to IF.The IF-B12 complex enters the ileal enterocyte, IF is degraded, and the B12 is released through MRP1 to plasma, where it binds with and is transported on TC.More details are provided in Text Box 2.Reproduced with permission from reference 14.
AMN, amnionless; B12, vitamin B-12; IF, intrinsic factor; MRP1, multidrug resistance protein 1; TC, transcobalamin. The binding of B12 to IF occurs in the more favorable, less acidic conditions in the small intestine.B12 absorption The primary site of intestinal absorption of B12 is the terminal ileum.Absorption occurs via receptor-mediated calcium- dependent endocytosis of the IF-B12 complex.The IF-B12 receptor consists of 2 components: ◦cubilin ◦receptor-associated protein Genetic defects in cubilin/receptor-associated protein– mediated B12 absorption underlie autosomal reces- sive megaloblastic anemia, also known as Imerslund- Grasbeck disease.B12 in the enterocyte Upon internalization within the ileal enterocyte,the IF- B12 complex enters a lysosome where IF is degraded and the B12 is released.The B12 is either metabolized to its active cofactor forms for use within the enterocyte or is processed for release into the portal circulation.
B12 exits unbound through the ABC drug transport protein, ABCC1 (also known as multidrug resistance protein 1),and then binds with unsaturated transcobal- amin in the circulation ( 13).An important aspect of ileal B12 absorption is that the number of IF-B12 receptors is limited on the apical membrane of the enterocyte. This restricts the capacity for physiologic absorption of B12 and explains why although 50% of a 1-µg oral dose of B12 is absorbed by the physiologic absorptive process, the percentage of the dose absorbed decreases with increasing amount of B12 consumed ( 1,14).In addition, after receptor-mediated absorption of B12, there is a refractory period of ∼6 h during which further uptake of IF-B12 is restricted while apical surface receptor density is regenerated (1).Enterohepatic circulation Another important component of B12 absorption is enterohep- atic circulation.It is estimated that between 0.5 and 5.0 µg of B12 is excreted in bile per day.
This biliary B12 is readily reabsorbed across the ileal enterocyte and, thus, enterohepatic circulation represents a mechanism by which B12 is conserved by the body. The efficiency of biliary B12 absorption is such thatB12depletionanddeficiencymaytakeyearsaftertheonset of dietary B12 deficit.However, in conditions that cause B12 malabsorption (such as pernicious anemia), B12 depletion and deficiency can be very rapid ( <1y )(15–17).Further details are provided in the section on bioavailability.Plasma transport B12 transport in the plasma is accomplished by 2 proteins, haptocorrin and transcobalamin.BOND—Vitamin B-12 review 1997S Haptocorrin.The characteristics of haptocorrin are listed inText Box 3 .Plasma haptocorrin is typically ∼80–90% saturated with B12 and carries between 70% and 80% of total circulating B12.However, haptocorrin is not primarily responsible for delivering B12 to extrahepatic tissues because there are no haptocorrin receptors located on most cells.
Instead, haptocorrin-B12 is taken up by asialoglycoprotein receptors in the liver. Text Box 3 Characteristics of haptocorrin Haptocorrin forms are found in various bodily fluids, including: ◦plasma ◦breast milk ◦gastric juice ◦bile ◦saliva (also known as R-binder) The haptocorrins are glycoproteins that differ in carbohydrate modifications to their structures.Historically, it was believed that there were 2 primary plasma haptocorrin proteins,known as transcobalamin I and transcobalamin III.Today, transcobalamins I and III are referred to collectively as haptocorrin.Haptocorrins bind both B12 and B12 analogs.Haptocorrin may also sequester B12 from bacteria and thus may have an antimicrobial function.Because haptocorrin binds both B12 and B12 analogs, asialoglycoprotein receptor–mediated uptake of haptocorrin into liver may be a mechanism by which B12 analogs are removed from the circulation and excreted in the bile.IF is highly specific for B12 and does not bind B12 analogs.
Thus, B12 analogs are not reabsorbed by the IF-receptor–mediated process and are excreted in the stool. However, the original source of B12 analogs in the circulation is likely diet or gut microbiota, which suggests they are absorbed by a currently unknown absorptive process ( 11).Transcobalamin.The transport protein responsible for deliv- ery of B12 to all tissues is transcobalamin, previously known as transcobalamin II.Transcobalamin is typically ∼10–20% saturated and carries only 20–30% of circulating B12.B12 absorbedintheilealenterocytebytheIF-dependentmechanism appears in the portal venous blood bound to transcobalamin to form holotranscobalamin (holoTC).The amount of increase in serum holoTC concentrations after oral ingestion of B12 may be indicative of the absorptive capacity for the vitamin.Genetic deficiency of transcobalamin is associated with severe B12 deficiency ( 18).
In contrast, genetic deficiency of haptocorrin appears to have little or no effect on functional B12 status (19,20). Uptake of the transcobalamin-B12 complex into tissues occursbyreceptor-mediatedendocytosisviathetranscobalamin receptor (TcblR/CD320) ( 21).HoloTC then enters acidic lysosomes in which the transcobalamin protein is degraded and the B12 is released ( Figure 2).The B12 is then converted to its cofactor forms.Metabolic functions of B12 cofactors Adenosyl-B12 serves as a cofactor for mitochondrial methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, and methyl-B12 serves as acofactor for cytosolic methionine synthase (see Figure 2 ).
The mitochondrial enzyme is important for the metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids and ketogenic amino acids, whereas the cytosolic enzyme is important for the remethylation of homocysteine (a putative vascular and neurotoxin), synthesis of methionine for protein synthesis and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) for methylation capacity, and maintaining DNA synthesis ( 20).Text Box 4 highlights the respective roles of these 2 cofactors. Text Box 4 Metabolic roles of B12 cofactors ( 11) 5′-Deoxyadenosylcobalamin Serves as a cofactor for the mitochondrial enzyme, methylmalonyl CoA mutase.MethylmalonylCoAmutasecatalyzestheconversionof methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA, an intermediate step in the conversion of propionate to succinate.Thisconversionisanimportantstepintheoxidationof odd-chainfattyacidsandinthecatabolismofketogenic amino acids.5-Methylcobalamin Serves as a cofactor in folate-dependent conversion of homocysteine to methionine, catalyzed by the enzyme methionine synthase.
Methionine is required for incorporation into proteins and for the synthesis of the universal methyl donor, SAM. Themethioninesynthasereactionalsoconvertsmethyl- tetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate: ◦Tetrahydrofolate is subsequently converted to methylenetetrahydrofolate after condensation with formate or by a one-carbon transfer during conversion of serine to glycine.◦Methylenetetrahydrofolate can be reduced again to form methyltetrahydrofolate, or can serve as the one-carbon source for the de novo synthesis of thymidylatefromdeoxyuridylate,requiredforDNA replication.Homeostatic controls and nutrient-nutrient interactions By virtue of its fundamental cofactor role in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine and the de novo synthesis of thymidylate, B12 works in concert with several other nutrients, most prominently folate, but also vitamin B-6 (as pyridoxal-5′-phosphate), riboflavin (as FAD), and choline.
These nutrient interrelations and homeostatic controls of one- carbon metabolism are described extensively in the Biomarkers of Nutrition for Development (BOND) review of folate ( 22). Additional levels of homeostatic control of homocysteine and one-carbon metabolism not discussed extensively in the folate review include allosteric regulation by SAM, a critical component of amino acid metabolism whose functions are highlighted in Text Box 5 .Text Box 5 Characteristics of SAM SAM is an allosteric inhibitor of methylenetetrahyro- folate reductase (MTHFR), the enzyme that catalyzes 1998S Supplement FIGURE 2 B12 cellular uptake and metabolism.In mitochondria, B12 as 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin is a cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which catalyzes conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA.In cytoplasm as 5-methylcobalamin, it is a cofactor for methionine synthase, which catalyzes conversion of homocysteine to methionine.

◦After a period of fasting or low protein (i.e., methionine)intake,cellularSAMconcentrationsde- crease and recycling of homocysteine to methionine is promoted whereas homocysteine catabolism is diminished. ◦Importantly, disruption of this homeostatic mech- anism, owing to B12, folate, or vitamin B-6 defi- ciencies, or genetic defects in key enzymes, results in the accumulation of the homocysteine precursor S-adenosylhomocysteine within cells, and increased homocysteine in the blood.Other homeostatic mechanisms affecting homocysteine and one-carbon metabolism involve oxidative stress and hor- monal regulation by insulin, estrogen, and thyroid hormone.Aside from potential health implications, these relations have possible value for the assessment of the 3 central nutrients in these pathways.
S-adenosylhomocysteine and homocysteine can serve as sentinel markers or bioindicators of the func- tional impact of deficiencies of vitamins including folate, vitamin B-6,and B12.The following is a brief coverage of each of these aspects of B12 and metabolic homeostasis. Oxidative stress.Oxidative stress influences homocysteine metabolism by promoting catabolism of the amino acid.The activities of the enzymes that convert homocysteine to methionine (methionine synthase and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase) are decreased, whereas the activity of cystathionine β-synthase is increased, under cellular oxidative stress(25).Theputativepurposeofthisregulationistoincrease the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione.Endocrine interactions.Insulin influences homocysteine metabolism by affecting the expression of key enzymes.Most prominently, CBS is inhibited by insulin, which causes reduced overall catabolism of homocysteine.
In models of type 1 diabetes, when insulin production is impaired, homocysteine concentrationsinthebloodactuallydecreaseowingtoincreased CBS expression and increased homocysteine catabolism ( 26). BOND—Vitamin B-12 review 1999S Only when diabetes progresses to affect kidney function does the blood concentration of homocysteine rise above normal.Lack of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) ( 27)a n dl a c k of estrogen (menopause) cause blood homocysteine to increase (28).The mechanisms by which these latter hormones affect homocysteine metabolism are less clear than for insulin, but taken together, these observations indicate that hormonal control is important for homeostatic control of these pathways.Importantly, hormonal status may affect the requirements for the B vitamins, including B12, for maintaining low blood homocysteine concentrations.
Implications of the interactions of folate and B12 Whether excess folic acid intake and consequent high folate status exacerbate biochemical and clinical manifestations of B12 deficiency is controversial. With the advent in the mid- to late-1990s of government-mandated folic acid fortification programs to prevent neural tube defects (NTDs), first in the United States and Canada and now globally in >70 countries,anincreaseintheprevalenceofindividualsexceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for folic acid intake (1000µg/d)(15)hasbeenreported( 29).Theprevalenceexceeds 10% in the subset of the US population that takes supplements containingfolicacid( 30).Theaccumulatingevidenceindicating the potential public health implications of this interaction is presentedin Text Box 6 .Theavailableevidencehasraisedsome concerns, particularly in populations with a high prevalence of low B12 status in which folic acid exposure is high owing to fortification policies and supplement use.
Text Box 6 Possible interactions between high folate status and B12 deficiency Epidemiologic studies indicate that although the risk of anemia and cognitive impairment is increased in B12-deficient individuals, the risk of these conditions is accentuated if folate status (based on plasma folate concentrations) is high ( 31). Biochemical indicators of B12 deficiency, including elevated blood concentrations of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA) and low blood concentra- tions of holoTC, are also accentuated by high folate status (32–34).The Pune Maternal Nutrition Study, in which off- spring exposed in utero to low B12 and high folate had increased adiposity and insulin resistance at age 6 y, suggested an influence of B12-folate imbalance on epigenetic programming ( 35).However, folic acid supplementation during their mother’s pregnancy did not further increase the risk of insulin resistance in 6- to 8-y-old Nepalese children beyond that of maternal B12 deficiency alone ( 36).
Recent evidence suggests that improvement in B12 status in deficient individuals after intramuscular B12 supplementationisattenuatedbyhighfolatestatus( 37). New data from the Human Nutrition Research Cen- ter on Aging in Boston show that elderly persons with a genetic variant in the transcobalamin gene TCN2(transcobalamin 776C →G) who consume high amountsoffolate(twicetheRDAof800 μgDietaryFo- lateEquivalents),mostlyduetosupplementscontaining folic acid, are 7 times more likely to have neuropathy (38).Additional investigations are needed to clarify whether there are any negative effects of high folate status on B12 metabolism, and specifically in B12-deficient individuals and population groups.Functions affected by B12 B12 cofactors are essential to the normal metabolism and function of a number of organ systems.The most well- established functional roles are summarized in Text Box 7 .The followingisabriefdescriptionoftheseandsomeotherpotential roles of B12 in human biology.
Aside from highlighting the functional role of B12 in these systems, this overview will also point out the strengths and weaknesses of available tools for evaluating these relations. TextBox7 FunctionsofB12cofactorsinorgansystems RBC synthesis and prevention of megaloblastic anemia.Neurologic function including prevention of neuropa- thy and demyelination.Cognitive function and prevention of dementia.Prevention of hyperhomocysteinemia.Hematology The classical clinical manifestation of B12 deficiency is macrocytic or megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by enlarged RBCs and hypersegmented neutrophils.The megaloblastic anemia of B12 deficiency is essentially identical to that caused by folate deficiency.Text Box 8 includes some of the salient points regarding the relations among B12, folate, and megaloblastic anemia ( 39).
Text Box 8 B12, folate, megaloblastic anemia, and the “folate trap” Folate, in the form of methylenetetrahydrofolate, is a required substrate for the conversion of uridylate to thymidylate and the subsequent incorporation of thymidine into DNA. When folate is deficient, DNA synthesis in the blood cell precursors of the bone marrow is inhibited, which prevents mitosis while allowing for cytoplasmic maturation.This results in enlarged, but reduced numbers of, circulating RBCs (i.e., megaloblastic anemia).B12 and the “folate trap:” ◦When B12 is deficient, the conversion of homocys- teineandmethyltetrahydrofolatetomethionineand tetrahydrofolate is inhibited.Folate is trapped as methyltetrahydrofolate and therefore cannot serve as a substrate for thymidine synthesis.◦Thus,a functional folate deficiency is produced and megaloblastic anemia ensues.
AsbothRBCandwhitebloodcellprecursorsaredepen- dent on folate and B12,pancytopenia and disturbances in both cellular and humoral immunity may occur. 2000S Supplement Aside from the characterization of these key biological relations, the fact that both folate and B12 result in a similar clinical outcome points to the limitation in reliance on a single bioindicator ( 40), such as RBC morphology, in attempting to make a differential diagnosis, and the need to complement the clinical outcome/bioindicator with sensitive and specific biomarkers of the nutrients in question, i.e., folate and B12.Neurologic function In addition to megaloblastic anemia, the other classical pathophysiologic manifestation of B12 deficiency is neuronal demyelinationaffectingboththeperipheralandcentralnervous systems ( 41).
There are several theories of the cause of demyelinating syndrome, including a deficiency of SAM and consequent inhibition of methylation reactions, which are re- quiredformembranephospholipidmetabolismandmetabolism of neurotransmitters ( 42). Alternatively, it has been proposed that the myeloneuropathy of B12 deficiency may result from disrupted odd-chain fatty acid metabolism caused by inhibition of the conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA ( 42).Neurologic symptoms of B12 deficiency in humans and rats are associated with alterations in cytokines and epidermal growth factor in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, which are corrected by B12 administration, and have been postulated to play a role in neuropathy ( 43).
The long tracts of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord are particularly vulnerable to B12 deficiency, resulting in loss of vibration and position sense, as well as loss of motor function often manifested as gait ataxia.Notably, the neurologic manifestations of B12 deficiency can precede or occur in absence of the hematologic consequences.Historically, B12 deficiency was typically suspected when megaloblastic anemia was the presenting symptom; in the absence of the anemia,theneurologicpathophysiologyofB12deficiencyoften went undiagnosed until permanent neurologic damage had occurred. There have been a few randomized controlled trials on the benefits of supplementation on neurologic function in people with marginal B12 status.
A recent study on elderly subjects with marginal B12 status residing in the United Kingdom failed to see benefits of 12 mo of B12 supplements on a battery of electrophysiologic measures of peripheral and central nerve function ( 44), although this trial has been criticized for use of insensitive outcome measures ( 45). In contrast, B12 treatment of Chilean elderly subjects with serum B12 <120 pmol/L at screening improved conductivity in myelinated peripheral nerves (37).This scenario again reinforces the need for complementarity in the assessment of suspected B12 insufficiency that includes both bioindicators of function, as well as sensitive and specific biomarkers of the vitamin.To prevent or reverse the neurologic damageofB12deficiency,treatmentwithB12supplements(i.e., intramuscular injections or high oral doses) must be initiated early after the onset of deficiency (within 6 mo to 1 y).
Cognition and dementia The concept of a reversible dementia due to cobalamin deficiency is widely acknowledged. However, in contrast to the dramatic improvement in hematologic signs after treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, there is limited evidence that cobalamin treatment improves cognitive status in patients with dementia.Low B12 status is associated with an increased risk of pathologically confirmed Alzheimer disease ( 46,47) but by the time the patient has moderate to severe dementia,the brainis probably too damaged to benefit from cobalamin treatment (48).Reversal of cognitive deficits has been observed in B12- deficient patients with cognitive impairment, but not dementia (49).Thus, all patients with cognitive impairment should have their cobalamin status investigated.There are several possible reasons for apparently contra- dictory reports in the literature about whether low cobalamin status contributes to cognitive decline and dementia.
Text Box 9summarizes the current state of the evidence with regard to both potential mechanisms and response to interventions. Text Box 9 B12 and cognition: current understanding of mechanisms and clinical evidence Even serum B12 in the “normal” range (i.e., >150 pmol/L)maybeassociatedwithcognitivedeficitorwith the risk of future cognitive decline ( 50–54).It is now recognized that serum B12 is not as sensitive a marker of functional cobalamin status as are markers such as holoTC,MMA,and total homocysteine (tHcy).Possible interactions between B12 status and clinical or biological context have been recognized including: folate status; concomitant depression; ApoE genotype; choline status; and homocysteine status.◦Clinical depression is common in the elderly.In 2 elderly populations, low cobalamin status was only associatedwithcognitiveimpairmentinpeoplewho had depression ( 55,56).
◦Theimportanceof APOEgenotypehasbeenshown in 2 studies, 1 in Caucasians ( 55) and 1 in Chinese (57).In both cohorts,only those who carried the E4 allele of ApoE showed an association between low cobalamin status and impaired cognition. ◦In the same Caucasian cohort, low cobalamin status became a significant risk factor for cognitive impairment in those with low choline status ( 58).◦The importance of plasma tHcy as a marker for a subgroup was shown in a randomized trial (VITACOG) on elderly people with mild cognitive impairment: ▪In VITACOG,a combination of B vitamins (800 μg folic acid,500 μgB 1 2 ,a n d2 0m gv i t a m i nB - 6/d) slowed brain atrophy and cognitive decline over a 2-y period ( 59,60),but only those whose baseline plasma tHcy was above the median (∼11µmol/L) benefitted from the B vitamins.
▪A further analysis showed that the B-vitamin treatment markedly slowed (by 90%) the rate of atrophy of the regions of the brain that are affected by Alzheimer disease, but only in those subjects with elevated tHcy. ▪Further data analysis showed that the key vitamin in the mixture was B12 ( 61).▪High tHcy was the strongest predictor of cog- nitive impairment in a population-based cross- sectional study of 839 elderly ( 62).Analysis of evidence from clinical trials There have been few randomized trials in which B12 alone has been given to assess its effect on cognitive function ( 63).Many were underpowered, too short in duration, and often carried out on the wrong type of subjects such as BOND—Vitamin B-12 review 2001S normal elderly who are not showing cognitive decline; thus, no conclusions can be drawn.TheconclusionofCochranereviewersin2003,thatnew trials are needed ( 64), is still valid.
There have been similar limitations in trials of combi- nations of B vitamins (folic acid, B12, and B-6). Meta- analyses ( 65,66) concluded that B-vitamin treatment does not improve cognitive function, but these studies included a number of trials where no effect would be anticipated ( 67).Another trial of B vitamins (400 μg folic acid/d, 100 μg B12/d) reported that cognitive decline was slowed in elderly subjects with depression,but the trial did not include a comparison group without depression ( 68).This review of the relation between B12 insufficiency and cognitive impairment would be incomplete without reference to the growing body of literature that describes adverse effects of high folic acid intake on cognitive function in people with marginal or insufficient B12 status.
The exacerbation of neurologic damage by high doses of folic acid was observed early in the history of this vitamin and that experience was briefly described above.In addition to some beneficial effects of good folate status on cognitive function referred to elsewhere, there have been several reports that high intake of folic acid or high bloodconcentrations offolate may be detrimentalto some cognitive functions. The following is a brief summary of the extant evidence with regard to the folate-B12-cognition nexus: The Chicago Health and Aging Project reported that those in the higher quintiles of total folate intake,mostly as folic acid, had a faster rate of cognitive decline ( 69).AnalysisoftheNHANEScohortintheUnitedStatesrevealed that those with low B12 status and high folic acid status were most likely to demonstrate cognitive impairment ( 31).
TworeportsfromAustraliahaveshownthathighfolatestatus is related to poor cognition, especially when the population is divided into those with low, normal, or high serum B12 concentrations ( 70,71). These and other observations have been reviewed recently ( 72).Taken together, these reports demonstrate that the greatest risk of cognitive impairment in those with low or insufficient status of B12 may exist in those (mostly elderly) who are exposed to high intakes of folic acid, which is not the natural form but rather a synthetic form of that vitamin used in supplements or fortification.In summary, the results of clinical trials and observational studies are consistent with the view that cobalamin plays an important role in cognition, but that its effects may be more noticeable in certain subgroups of the population.
Depression The association of low B12 status or intake with depression is not as well-established as its relation to cognition.The evidence can be summarized as follows: Several, but not all, cross-sectional studies have reported an association ( 73–78). Two prospective studies found associations between low B12 status or intake and later onset of depression ( 79,80).Trialsofcobalaminsupplementationinrelationtodepression arefewandmostlynegative;theonlypositiveresultwasfroma trial that included folic acid and vitamin B-6 as well as cobalamin ( 81).Notably, an association between low folate status and depression has long been recognized ( 82).The associations between folate, B12, and depression may be related to SAM, which has antidepressant properties ( 83), and as highlighted above, both folate and B12 are required for the synthesis of SAM.
Although there have been calls for the addition of cobalamin and folic acid to standard antidepressant treatments (84), a large community study showed no interaction ( 85). More research is clearly needed and it will be necessary to examine subgroups of the population, as in the studies on cognition.NTDs and pregnancy outcome Although folic acid fortification and periconceptional folic acid supplements are responsible for dramatic reductions in the incidenceofNTDs,aresidualrateofNTDsremains.Becauseof the shared roles of B12 and folate in one-carbon metabolism,it isreasonablypredictedthatlowB12statuscouldberesponsible for some of the residual incidence.Indeed, case-control studies confirm an association between low maternal B12 status and risk of NTDs in offspring ( 86–88).
In Canada, where flour has been fortified with folic acid since 1997, a case-control study in midpregnancy revealed that women in the lowest quartile for holoTC ( <55.3 pmol/L) had 3 times the risk of an NTD delivery compared with those in the highest quartile ( 89). A meta-analysisofpublishedreportsalsofoundthatlowmaternal serum B12 is a risk factor for NTDs ( 90).However, unlike the situation for folic acid, there have been no randomized controlled trials of B12 supplements to assess the influence on NTD risk.Maternal B12 nutrition, lactation, and child development The risks of B12 insufficiency are especially strong during the period before conception, throughout pregnancy and lactation, and for infants and young children: LowmaternalserumB12andelevatedtHcyduringpregnancy result in low B12 and high tHcy in cord blood ( 91).Elevated tHcy in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of low birth weight that is not explained by folate status (92,93).
Infantsborn to B12-deficient vegan women are at high riskof being born with low stores of the vitamin, and of developing serious clinical signs of deficiency during the first year of life, including developmental delays,only about half of which are reversed by B12 supplementation ( 94). Human milk concentrations of B12 are strongly related to maternal status during pregnancy and postpartum, and can be extremely low even in nonvegetarian populations in developing countries who consume inadequate amounts of animal source foods ( 95–97).Clearly, poor maternal status affects fetal and infant status, the influence of which is apparent into at least early childhood.The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has concluded that infants of vegan mothers shouldbesupplementedwiththeAdequateIntake(AI)ofB12 startingatbirthbecausetheirstoreswillbelow,aswillbreast- milk concentrations of the vitamin ( 15).
2002S Supplement Noncommunicable diseases Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) continue to rise and contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in the United States and globally.B12 status has been linked to several of the most prominent NCDs, as summarized briefly in Text Box 10 . Text Box 10 B12 and NCDs Cardiovascular disease The specific role of B12 status in cardiovascular health is unclear.Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).Because B12, as well as folate and vitamin B-6, is re- quired for the metabolism of homocysteine,deficiencies of these vitamins cause hyperhomocysteinemia.This suggests that lowering blood homocysteine with B-vitamin supplements should reduce risk of CVD.B-vitamin supplements effectively reduce plasma tHcy, but such reductions have not typically translated into reduced CVD risk in randomized clinical trials ( 98,99).
The one possible exception is stroke, for which some benefit of B-vitamin supplements and homocysteine lowering has been observed ( 100). It remains unclear if B12 status itself (independent of folate and vitamin B-6) is an important determinant of CVD risk.Cancer Unlike folate,the influence of B12 status on cancer risk has not been studied extensively.Thebestevidence fora roleofB12in cancer isinbreast cancer (101).One prospective study found that low B12 status was associated with increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women ( 102).A second prospective study found an association in premenopausal women, but not postmenopausal women ( 103).
The putative mechanisms by which low B12 status mightcontributetoincreasedcancerriskarethesameas for folate,i.e.,impaired synthesis of thymidine required for DNA synthesis leading to DNA strand breaks due to uracil misincorporation, and disruption of DNA methylation leading to alterations in genome stability and altered patterns of gene expression. Bone health Osteoporosis has long been established to be a consequence of untreated pernicious anemia, although an influence of reduced gastric acid secretion in this condition cannot be ruled out ( 104).In mice lacking gastric IF, B12 deficiency low- ered serum growth hormone and diminished liver production of taurine and subsequently of IGF-I, which reduces osteoblastic proliferation and function (105).Several, but not all, observational studies in the elderly have shown relations of serum B12 concentration with various measures or markers of bone mineral density (106,107).
A 2-y, randomized, vitamin D-controlled intervention trialonDutchelderlywithelevatedtHcyconcentrationsprovided 500 μg B12 and 400 μg folic acid/d,but there was no overall effect of this treatment on bone ( 108). Ameta-analysisof4prospectivestudieson7475people reported a 4% decrease in bone fractures per 50 µmol/LincreaseinserumB12,whichreachedborderline significance ( 109).However, although a meta-analysis of 8 studies on 11,511 people found an increased fracture risk of 4%/µmol tHcy, there were too few studies evaluating the risk specifically associated with serum B12 or folate (110).Clinical considerations B12 deficiency is caused either by malabsorption secondary to gastrointestinal disease,aging,and surgery,or,most commonly, by consuming low amounts of animal source foods.
Clinical presentation of B12 deficiency is more likely to occur as a result of medical conditions (e.g., pernicious anemia, malabsorption) whereas inadequate intake results in abnormal biomarkers, associated SCCD, and more subtle functional effects. Clinical stages of B12 insufficiency The major clinical symptoms of B12 deficiency result from impairment of the functions for which the vitamin is required (Text Box 11 ).Theorgansystemsprimarilyaffectedincludethe blood and nervous system.Text Box 11 Stages of B12 insufficiency Events in the blood: ◦IncreaseinplasmaMMAconcentrationandurinary MMA excretion ◦Decrease in serum holoTC and serum B12 ◦Increase in plasma tHcy concentration ◦Reduction in RBC B12 ◦Hypersegmentation of nuclei in neutrophils ◦Megaloblastic anemia—abnormally large RBCs with large nuclei; increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration Megaloblastic changes in bone marrow.Infertility and recurrent fetal loss.
Weakness and fatigue. Demyelination of neurons.Reduced conductivity of peripheral and central neu- rons.Peripheral neuropathy, abnormal gait, and position sense.Subacute combined degeneration (myelopathy).Brain atrophy.Dementia, depression, memory loss, and psychosis.As discussed above,it is not unusual for the neurologic com- plications to precede the appearance of hematologic changes and in fact, for reasons that are poorly understood, patients tendtopresentwitheitherhematologicorneurologicsymptoms in many cases ( 111).Thus, the presence of megaloblastic anemia alone is not a reliable way to diagnose B12 deficiency.BOND—Vitamin B-12 review 2003S Importantly, B12 deficiency has to be relatively severe before anemia appears.Text Box 12 is a summary of the current approaches and considerations in the clinical diagnosis of B12 deficiency.
Text Box 12 Clinical considerations in the clinical diagnosis of B12 deficiency Assessment of megaloblastic anemia Is readily made with a Complete Blood Count, which includes: ◦MCVandmeancorpuscularhemoglobinconcentra- tion,bothofwhichwillbeelevatedinthiscondition. Nutrient interactions to be considered: ◦Iron deficiency anemia (microcytosis, which can present in a substantial number of B12-deficient patients because both can be caused by low meat intake) can obscure the macrocytosis ( 112).◦Folate status must be considered because: ▪Both folate and B12 deficiencies cause mega- loblasticanemia,soitisimportanttodistinguish the cause of the anemia before treatment.▪Folic acid supplements may ameliorate the anemia of B12 deficiency by providing folate for thymidine and DNA synthesis.Alternatively, megaloblastic erythrocytes can be identi- fied by microscopy.
Clinical attributes of neurologic symptoms of B12 deficiency Neurologic complications result from demyelination of peripheral and central nerves. Because some of the symptoms respond rapidly to intramuscular injection with therapeutic doses of B12 (112), other mechanisms are likely involved.There is evidence that the neurologic damage of B12 deficiency is exacerbated by folic acid supplements ( 31, 42,70), although this remains controversial.Methodsusedtoassessneurologicfunctioninsuspected B12 deficiency include: ◦vibratory sensation ◦nerve conduction velocity ◦visual and auditory evoked potentials ◦tests of abnormal gait ◦detection of peripheral neuropathy ◦MRI, which detects signal changes in the lateral and posterior columns of the spinal cord and in subcorticalwhitematter,amongotherabnormalities Dietary B12 Humans are unable to synthesize B12 and are therefore fully dependent on dietary intake, supplements, or fortified foods.
TheUSDANationalNutrientDatabaseforStandardReference, release 25, is the most up-to-date and extensive source of data on the B12 content of foods. It is supported by the federal government and updated regularly with new analytic data on the composition of foods and supplements.Table 1andText Box 13summarize current data regarding the B12 content of some foods.TABLE 1 B12 content of selected foods1 Food Serving µg/serving Clams,cooked 3oz 84 Liver,beef,cooked 3oz 71 Fish,trout 3oz 3.5 Salmon,cooked 3oz 5 Breakfastcerealfortifiedwith100%DailyValue 1serving 6 Tunainwater 3oz 2.5 Beefsirloin,broiled 3oz 1.4 Milk,low-fat 1cup 1.2 Yogurt,fruit,low-fat 8oz 1.1 Cheese,Swiss 1oz 0.9 Egg,cooked 1large 0.6 Chickenbreast,cooked 3oz 0.3 1Values from reference 113.3o z =∼100 g, 8 oz =∼227 g, 1 cup =237 mL.Text Box 13 Food sources of B12 Theonlycommonlyconsumednaturalfoodsourcesare animal source foods, including meat, fish, dairy, eggs, and liver.
Some dried green ( Enteromorpha spp.) and purple (Porphyra spp.,nori) seaweeds may contain substantial amounts of B12,as a result of a symbiotic relation with bacteria. Spirulina does not; the corrinoid in blue-green algae is biologically inactive ( 114).Tempehmaycontainsomeofthevitaminsynthesizedby bacteria and mold produced during fermentation, but fermented soybeans and fermented Korean vegetables do not.Per100g,afewfoodsstandoutasbeingespeciallyhigh in the vitamin, including shellfish and liver ( Table 1).The B12 content of foods is commonly measured by a microbiological assay, but this is relatively time-consuming and expensive.The USDA now uses a combination of capillary electrophoresis and inductively coupled plasma MS to measure B12 in foods and supplements.This method provides values for the individual cobalamins found in foods and for cyanocobalamin, the form usually used in supplements and for food fortification.
Bioavailability To understand the true value of dietary sources and establish recommended intakes, it is critical to understand the bioavail- ability of B12. For setting B12 recommendations the IOM referred to older studies which measured the absorption of B12 with the use of isotopes ( 15,18).Collectively those studies showed that ∼50% of a 1- μgo r a l dose was retained, 20% of a 5- μg dose, and ∼5% of a 25- μg dose(16,17)(Figure3).After4–6h,thereisnoinhibitoryeffect ofthefirstdoseonsubsequentdoses( 115).Athigherdoselevels (e.g., 500 μg), only 1% is absorbed ( 116).This occurs because the B12-IF complex is saturated at low doses but 1% can be passively absorbed,even in the absence of IF,and can therefore provide benefit to patients with pernicious anemia ( 117).
In a systematic review by the EURopean Micronutrient RECommendations Aligned (EURRECA) group on bioavail- ability of B12 from different food sources, 8 papers were 2004S Supplement FIGURE 3 Relation between the intake and percentage absorbed fromadoseofB12( 17)basedondatafromChanarin( 16).Reproduced with permission from reference 16. B12, vitamin B-12.identified thataddressedabsorptionofB12fromaspecific food product alone or in combination with a meal free of B12 ( 118).Studypopulationsincludedhealthysubjectsandsubjectswitha disease not affecting B12 absorption,and only individuals with average daily intakes ≤6μg were included.Overall,absorption ranged from 4.5% (from liver providing 38 µg) to 83% (from mutton providing 3 µg); from 24% to 36% for egg products (dose 0.3–0.94 µg); from 52% to 83% for lean meat (dose 0.54–5.11µg); from 30% to 42% for fish (dose 2.1–13.1 µg); and from 4.5% to 49% for liver products (dose 0.5–38 µg).
Daily losses of the vitamin in these studies were measured by loss in body radioactivity after administration of a dose of labeled B12, or B12 excretion in bile corrected for estimated reabsorption ( 118). In general, absorption of 50% of the vita- min from the diet is assumed for estimating B12 requirements (16,119).However,becausethereisamaximumamountofB12 that can be absorbed per meal,it is possible that adjustment for thisrealitymayimprovethestrengthofassociationsbetweenin- takeandbothstatusandfunctionaloutcomes.IntheEURRECA analysis, the amount absorbed was estimated by the equation: logabsorption =0.7694 ×logintake–0.9614( 118).Thisequa- tion does not account for the potentially more efficient absorp- tion that could occur when intake is spread across a day,which istheusualsituation,andapolynomialfittothedataisactually better and shows the reduced efficiency of absorption at higher intakes.
A more simple approach may be to divide the amount of B12 in B12-rich foods by 5,given that only 11% is absorbed from liver,for example ( 95,115).These methods for estimating absorption efficiency from intake need further testing. Recommended intakes The IOM has several values for recommended intakes in the UnitedStatesandCanada,formostlifestageandgendergroups (15): Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): the median usual intake that meets the requirements of 50% of the population.An intake less than the EAR is considered to be inadequate.RDA: the EAR plus 2 SD.It represents the average daily dietary intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of 97.5% of the population.AI: the amount of a nutrient consumed by a group with no evidence of inadequacy.
UL: the maximum daily intake level at which no risk of adverse effects is anticipated for almost all individuals in thegeneral population, including sensitive individuals, when the nutrient is consumed over long periods of time. Text Box 14 is a summary of key points in the IOM’s recommendations on B12 intakes.Examples of recommended intakes of dietary B12 around the world are provided in Table 2.Text Box 14 Key points with regard to IOM B12 recommendations For adults the recommendations are based on the daily amount needed to maintain normal hematologic values andserumB12withinthenormalrange,inpatientswith inability to absorb B12 due to pernicious anemia.The steps in this calculation were to estimate the averageamountrequiredfromintramuscularinjections, account for the lack of reabsorption of B12 from bile, andcorrectforanaveragebioavailabilityof50%based on absorption of the radiolabeled vitamin from food.
No UL was set because there have been no reported adverse effects of high intakes or large intramuscular injections of B12. Absorption of the crystalline B12 added to cereals and fortified foods, and used in supplements, is likely to be closer to 60%.Elderly should consume most of their B12 in the crystalline form, i.e., from supplements and/or fortified foods, because this form is likely to be better absorbed by those with food-cobalamin malabsorption.The EAR and RDA for pregnant women are increased by 0.2 μg/d to cover fetal deposition of B12.The AI for infants is based on an estimated 300 pmol/L in breast milk.Recommendations for children are extrapolations downwards from adults.Recommended intakes for lactating women are in- creased to cover the secretion of B12 in breast milk.
TheIOMReviewCommitteeestimatedthatfood-cobalamin malabsorptionmayoccurin10–30%oftheelderly,andthatthis group should therefore consume the majority of their B12 from fortifiedfoodsorsupplements,i.e.,inthecrystallineform.There would be no point in increasing the recommended amount of B12 consumed from unfortified food because the assumption is that it would be poorly absorbed, and no countries in Table 2 adviseahigherintakefortheelderly.TheFAO/WHOessentially adopted the IOM recommendations ( 120). In Europe, B12 recommendations (RDAs) for adults vary from 1.5 to 4.0 µg/d (Table 2).This variability is due to the selection of different CVs in requirements (10–20%) and of different indicators of B12 status adequacy for maintaining health (e.g.,maintenance of hematologic status or basal losses).These recommendations were collated within the EURRECA network of excellence ( 118,126).
The European Food Safety Authority recently published its Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for cobalamin (123). These values, also shown in Table 2, are substantially higher than those from other countries based primarily on the observation that reported intakes of 4 μg/d are consistent with reference ranges for serum B12 and holoTC in healthy adults, and with tHcy and MMA concentrations below the cutoffs for inadequacy.

2Indicates an AI that is estimated to cover the needs of all in the group, but lack of data prevents being able to specify the percentage actually covered b y this intake. Authority values are AIs.The AIs for infants and children are extrapolated downwards from the values for adults and increased in pregnancy based on fetal accretion of B12, and in lactation for secretion of B12 into breast milk.The Nordic Nutrition Recommendations for B12 intake, last published in 2012,are unchanged from those set in 2004; the experts found no strong scientific data to suggest that changes were needed (124).The Recommended Dietary Allowances for Southeast Asia do not provide a value for B12 ( 127).Dietary intake of B12 With the use of data from NHANES from 1999–2000, B12 intake was estimated from one 24-h recall interview of a total of 8604 participants ( 128).
All ages were included and smaller population subgroups (adolescents, elderly, Mexican Ameri- cans, African Americans, low-income persons, and pregnant women) were oversampled to increase precision. For all ages combined, the mean intake of B12 was 4.6 μg/d (median 3.4 μg/d), ranging from 3.1 μg/d at <6yo l dt o5 .1 μg/d at 40–59 y old.Data from 8860 adults in the NHANES 2003–2006 survey were analyzed to compare the prevalence of inadequate intakes insupplementusersandnonusers( 129).Menconsumedamean of 6.6 μg from food and women consumed 4.1 μg.Approxi- mately 12% of women had inadequate intakes of B12 ( <EAR) unlesstheyconsumedsupplements,inwhichcasetheprevalence of inadequacy was <1%.Intake by users of supplements was 66μg for men and 72 μg for women.
Results from European surveys are summarized in Table 3 and include the following: A meta-analysis based on 9 surveys including 28,015 adults and elderly people ( 130), revealing that mean B12 intakes ranged from 3.8 to 9.3 µg/d in men and from 3.5 to 8.8 μg/d in women. The prevalence of inadequate intake was <10% in studies from Denmark (with the exception of women), Germany,Portugal, Spain, Sweden (men), and the United Kingdom (women).Men in the nutrition surveys from Finland and women in Ireland had a prevalence of intake inadequacy between 21% and 30%, as did elderly women from the United Kingdom and Finland.It is possible that differences in the methodology for measuring B12intakecanexplainsomeofthedifferencesamongestimates.
B12 intakes are low in most low- and middle-income coun- tries (LMICs) ( 131,132), primarily due to limited availability and affordability of animal source foods, but in some cases low intake is due to the avoidance of these sources of B12 for religious or cultural reasons. Prevalence and causes of inadequate B12 status The ability to achieve an adequate status of any essential nutrient,asdeterminedbybiochemicalassessment,isdependent onseveralprocesses,includingingestion,digestion,metabolism, and incorporation into dependent biological systems.These processes are affected by numerous factors that will be briefly reviewed in the following sections.The major causes of poor B12 status are a low intake and malabsorption from food.On a global basis, deficiency due to low intake is much more common.Unless intake is very low,di- etarydeficiencyismorelikelytoresultinchangesinbiomarkers reflecting SCCD than in clinical symptoms of deficiency.
Prevalence of B12 deficiency In the most recent NHANES to report B12 status data in the United States, the prevalence of deficiency was estimated based on several different cutoffs for both serum B12 and MMA (133). In the total sample, prevalence of low serum B12 was 2.8% based on a cutoff of <148 pmol/L, 10.5% based on <200 pmol/L, and 25.6% based on <258 pmol/L.Similarly,prevalenceofdeficiencywasdifferentbasedoncutoffs for MMA of >376 nmol/L (2.3%) or >271 nmol/L (5.8%).

Notably, the prevalence of low B12 status (based on conventional adult cutoffs for deficiency and marginal status combined) varies widely, with some countries exceeding 40% in different subpopulations (children,young adults,women of childbearing age, pregnant women, and older adults). Validation of cutoffs is still needed to improve assessment of the global prevalence of B12 deficiency, especially in infants, young children, and pregnant women.Factors associated with inadequate intake of B12 It is well known that strict vegetarianism (veganism) will lead to B12 deficiency unless supplements or fortified foods are consumed.
For a healthy, well-nourished person who changes abruptly from an omnivorous diet to one containing no or very small amounts of animal source foods, biomarkers of status BOND—Vitamin B-12 review 2007S FIGURE 5 Prevalence of low ( <148 pmol/L) and marginal (148–221 pmol/L) plasma or serum B12 concentrations in selected representative national surveys and large nonrepresentative studies.

Itislesscommonlyrecognizedthatevenmoderaterestriction of animal source foods will affect B12 status. For example, it has been reported that omnivores have better B12 status than those who avoid meat,poultry,and fish (lacto-ovo vegetarians), and they in turn have better status than lacto-vegetarians, withvegans having the poorest status ( 143).Indeed, a high propor- tion of adult lacto-ovo vegetarians in Germany had low serum B12 (26% <156 pmol/L); 77% had low holoTC and 68% had elevated MMA ( 143).In a cohort in Boston, serum B12 was correlatedwithtotaldailyintakeofthevitaminacrosstherange ofintakeregardlessofage,andintakeofmilk,supplements,and fortified cereal protected against lower serum B12 concentra- tions (144).Thus, in general, the prevalence of insufficiency is inversely related to the intake of animal source foods.Worldwide, the percentage of energy contributed daily by animal source foods is often very low ( 145).
It is likely that >25% of a population’s energy has to be consumed as dairy 2008S Supplement products,eggs,fish,meat,orpoultrytosupportalowprevalence of B12 deficiency. Several studies conducted in LMICs have highlighted these important associations: In countries such as Kenya and India,where animal products constitute ∼5–10% of energy, prevalences of B12 deficiency are very high: ◦>70% in Kenyan schoolchildren ( 146) ◦27% (serum B12 <150 pmol/L) in New Delhi preschool- ers (147) ◦67% of 442 adult men in Pune, India, had serum B12 <150 pmol/L; in the urban middle class, 81% had serum B12 below this value ( 148).Vegetarians had a 4-times greater risk of low serum B12 than omnivores.

In Kenyan children,the risk of low plasma B12 ( <148 pmol/L) was>6 times higher for those in the lowest compared with the highest tertile,even though overall intake in the population was very low ( 150).Supplementation with animal source foods significantly reduced the prevalence of deficiency.Developmental perspective on B12 intake and status Theperiodofpregnancythroughearlychildhoodhasimportant implications for B12 exposure and status as evidenced by the following: B12deficiencycanstartinearlyinfancyasaresultoflowfetal storesatbirthifthemotherisdeficientduringpregnancy( 94).
Deficits will continue or be exacerbated by low maternal intake during lactation with consequent low amounts of the vitamin in the mother’s milk ( 96,97). During the period of complementary feeding and in child- hood, low intakes of animal source foods—and especially of meat—are common in poor populations.Human milk is much lower in B12 than in formulas [ ∼300 (range 150–700) pmol/L in milk from well-nourished women compared with 800–1200 pmol/L in formulas].In all studies, including higher-income countries and LMICs, where the status of breastfeeding relative to formula-feeding infants has been compared, B12 status is poorer in the breastfed infants based on differences in ≥1 B12 status biomarker ( 151).Consumption by partially breastfed Guatemalan infants of unfortified cow milk, which contains more B12 than breast milk, especially in Guatemala where breast-milk concentrations are very low, was a predictor of better infant B12 status ( 152).
Malabsorption Less commonly, affecting 2–4% of adults >60 y of age ( 153), B12 deficiency is caused by pernicious anemia, an autoimmune disease with a genetic component that destroys the gastric mucosa,resulting in lack of IF and consequent lack of ileal B12 absorption. Prevention of deficiency under these circumstances requires lifelong oral or intramuscular high doses of B12.Pernicious anemia can also be caused by long-term gastric atrophy or atrophic gastritis and eventual destruction of the gastric parietal cells and loss of gastric acid.The latter impairs the release of B12 from food, and can also cause bacterial overgrowth with competition for the vitamin ( 154).Atrophic gastritis and malabsorption of B12 from food can result from long-term chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori(155) and/or accompanying bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine.For example, serum B12 concentrations were substantially lower in Palestinian patients with gastric disease due to H.
pylori infection compared with those with gastritis who were noninfected ( 156). Atrophic gastritis is commonly believed to be an important contributor to B12 deficiency in the elderly ( 156–158 ), possibly affecting 10–30% of the older population ( 15),although this is somewhat controversial ( 159).Food-bound cobalamin malabsorption is relatively rare in younger healthy persons but increases with aging ( 160).Factors associated with food-cobalamin malabsorption were investigated in a prospective study of 202 subjects (43 volunteers and 159 patients) ( 160).Based on the egg yolk cobalamin absorption test, food-cobalamin malabsorption was significantly correlated with H.pylori infection (especially in severe malabsorption), age, markers of gastritis such as serum gastrin, and Latin-American and African-American compared with Asian-American ethnicity (an association independent of H.pylori infection).
The investigators concluded that there are multiple causes of food-cobalamin malabsorption of which gastritis is one. There are a number of approaches to test for B12 malabsorption, as listed in Text Box 15 .Text Box 15 Tests to assess B12 malabsorption Malabsorption from food can be detected by dosing with food containing the vitamin labeled with radioac- tive cobalt, and after excretion of the label in urine.In food-bound cobalamin malabsorption the vitamin can usually be absorbed normally in its crystalline form such as in supplements or fortified food.Schilling’s test relies on measuring urinary excretion of an oral57Co-labeled test dose of B12 after intramus- cular injection of nonlabeled B12 administered ∼2h postdose.◦It was usually performed with the crystalline form which would not diagnose malabsorption of the vitamin from food.
◦It could, however, be modified to detect food- cobalaminmalabsorptionbymixingthelabeledB12 with egg yolk (the egg yolk cobalamin absorption test) or chicken serum before administration, an approach that was used most often in clinical research. ◦NeithertheSchillingtestnortheeggyolkcobalamin absorption test modification are used as clinical diagnostic procedures today ( 161).Alternatives to Schilling’s test: ◦Assessment of IF antibody can often diagnose pernicious anemia with >95% specificity, but with only 50–70% sensitivity.◦Elevated serum gastrin or low pepsinogen can often diagnose gastric dysfunction.◦The CobaSorb test ( 162,163) is based on the fact that newly absorbed B12 circulates in the plasma BOND—Vitamin B-12 review 2009S as holoTC.By giving three 9- μg doses of crystalline cyanocobalamin in water over the period of a day, andmeasuringtheincreaseinplasmaholoTConthe following day, malabsorbers can be detected.
◦The test has to be given before subjects are treated for B12 deficiency, otherwise the anticipated large increase in holoTC will not occur. The CobaSorb test measures relative absorption—the actual per- centage absorbed cannot be quantified.◦By administering a very low dose14C vitamin labeled by bacterial synthesis ( 164), excretion of the label in urine and feces can provide a quantitative estimate of the percentage absorbed, i.e., bioavailability.The labeled vitamin has been incorporated into chicken eggs in vivo as a test for food-boundabsorption(LHAllenetal.,USDA,ARS Western Human Nutrition Research Center, Davis, CA, 2018), or used in its crystalline form ( 164).Gastrointestinal disease or resection B12 deficiency can result from gastrointestinal malabsorption associated with conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis) and HIV infection ( 165).
In an evaluation of >500 patients, the risk of B12 deficiency amongthosewithCrohndiseasewas33%comparedwith16% in those with ulcerative colitis ( 166). Celiac disease, tropical sprue,bacterialovergrowth( 154),bypassorextensiveresection of the ileum ( 167), and total or partial gastrectomy can also cause deficiency.The odds of postoperative B12 deficiency after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are >3 times higher compared with sleeve gastrectomy ( 168).Medications Clinically the potential for nutrient-drug interactions is an important consideration because it may pertain to specific conditions and across developmental stages.The following are some examples where B12 status may be compromised by the use of some therapeutic medications and drugs: Gastric acid suppression medications such as histamine 2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can impairthereleaseofB12fromfood.InsomestudiesonlyPPIs increased the risk of B12 deficiency in the elderly ( 169).
In a large case-control study in older patients, B12 deficiency was more common with PPI or histamine 2 receptor antagonist use for >2 y,especially with higher dosages ( >1.5 PPI pills/d) (170). Metformin treatment of diabetes is associated with signif- icantly lower serum B12 concentrations.In the NHANES 1999–2006 surveys the geometric mean serum B12 con- centrations were 318 and 387 pmol/L in metformin users and nonusers, respectively ( 171).However, tHcy was not increased by metformin.It now appears from animal studies that metformin causes B12 to accumulate in the liver, thus lowering serum concentrations and not causing true deficiency ( 172,173).Chronic exposure to the anesthetic gas, nitrous oxide, can cause an acquired, functional B12 deficiency ( 174– 176).
Nitrous oxide causes the irreversible oxidation of methylcobalamin, the cofactor form of B12 required for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine by the enzyme methioninesynthase.Initially,thiscausesbloodhomocysteine concentrations to rise, and if prolonged, can precipitate B12 deficiency–associated neuropathy, particularly in individuals who already have low B12 status.Highly active antiretroviral therapy substantially reduces the prevalence of low serum B12 in HIV-infected adults, likely by improving intestinal physiologic function, including B12 absorption ( 177). OthermedicationsanddrugsthataffectB12statusbiomark- ers are described in Table 4.Some of these affect each of the 4 biomarkers differently.
Inborn errors of intracellular B12 metabolism Genetic anomalies have been identified that affect all aspects of B12 absorption, transport, and metabolism, and range from gene deletions and mutations that cause severe but rare B12 deficiency disorders, to single nucleotide polymorphisms that have mild and subtle effects. Several mutations affecting proteinsinvolvedincellularB12uptake,intracellulartransport, and activation have been identified ( Figure 6).The key charac- teristics of these mutations are highlighted in Text Box 16 .

Single nucleotide polymorphisms A highly prevalent polymorphism occurs in the gene that encodes for transcobalamin ( TCN2).It is a C-to-G substitution at base position 776 (776C >G) that results in an arginine in place of a proline in amino acid position 259 ( 186,187). The 776G allele is most prevalent in Asian populations, with a lower prevalence in whites,and still lower prevalence in blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans ( 188,189).The 776C >G polymorphism is most consistently associated with reducedapotranscobalamin and holoTC in serum ( 190–199 ).In some studies, it has been associated with increased serum MMA and a lower percentage of total B12 bound to transcobalamin (holoTC:serum total B12 ratio) ( 195).Cerebrospinal fluid holoTC also is lower in 776G homozygotes ( 200).Total B12 and homocysteine typically are not significantly affected, although the transcobalamin genotype modifies the association between measures of B12 status (total B12, holoTC, and tHcy) (193).
These observations suggest that the 776G allele may BOND—Vitamin B-12 review 2011S affect the affinity of transcobalamin for B12. Clinically, the 776C>G polymorphism may affect the risk of several birth outcomes,includingspontaneousabortionandcleftliporpalate (201–203 ).Itisassociatedwithperipheralneuropathyinelderly individuals with high folate intake ( 38).Single nucleotide polymorphisms have also been identified in the genes encoding the enzymes methionine synthase and methionine synthase reductase, and in IF.The 2756A >G polymorphism in methionine synthase has been associated with various birth defects, including NTDs, orofacial clefts, and Down syndrome ( 201,204–207 ).The 66A >G polymorphism in methionine synthase reductase has been associated with NTDs and Down syndrome ( 204,206–209 ).Recently, a polymorphism has been identified in IF, 68A >G; 1 study associated this polymorphism with congenital IF deficiency,but this finding has not been confirmed ( 210).
Prevention and Treatment of B12 Deficiency Treatment of symptomatic cobalamin deficiency,resulting from pernicious anemia or other malabsorptive conditions, requires a different strategy from treating dietary deficiency, with repeated follow-ups to confirm the efficacy of treatment ( 112). Remission of clinical symptoms of deficiency associated with malabsorptive disorders requires a higher dose than treatment of dietary deficiency, and is less effective with increasing time between the onset of symptoms and the start of treatment.Specific considerations regarding treatment of B12 deficiency under these conditions are outlined in Text Box 17 .Text Box 17 Considerations for the treatment of B12 owing to malabsorption disorders The first step is to confirm the diagnosis of the cause of the deficiency is correct, including biomarker assess- ment,becauseclinicalvalueswillchangemarkedlyonce treatment is started.
The usual treatment is an intramuscular injection of 1000 μg cyanocobalamin (or hydroxocobalamin) of which ∼150μg is retained. Response to treatment: ◦Corrects the anemia, increases reticulocyte count within 48 h,and results in a peak reticulocyte count 1w ka f t e rt r e a t m e n t .◦Normal MCV within 2 mo, and begins to rebuild liver stores.◦MMAandtHcyshouldstarttocorrectwithin1wk.◦Neurologic symptoms should also improve within 1 wk and be resolved in 6–12 wk unless the deficiency is untreated for >6m oo r1yi nw h i c h case neurologic symptoms may not be corrected because of irreversible damage to the nervous system.Repeated 1000- μg injections should be given weekly during the initial treatment phase, after which monthly injections are routine for maintaining adequate status.
High-dose oral supplements ( ≥500μg/d) can also be considered in conditions of physiologic malabsorption because ∼1% of oral doses is absorbed by passive diffusion.Dietary B12 deficiency Vegan or vegetarian diets, or diets limited in animal source foods, are likely to cause biochemical signs of B12 depletion, or even deficiency. Clinical symptoms, including anemia, are less likely than SCCD, but there are still risks attached to poor B12 status.Such diets are especially ill-advised during pregnancy unless supplements or fortified foods providing the RDA are consumed, because fetal liver stores will not be built, breast-milk B12 concentrations will be low, and there is risk of developmental delays in the infant ( 94).
Vegetarians and vegans can obtain sufficient amounts of B12 from fortified cereals and special B12-fortified vegetarian products,orfromsupplements.TheVeganSocietyintheUnited KingdomrecommendsthatvegansconsumeB12-fortifiedfoods such as breakfast cereals, soya drinks, or yeast extracts several times a day or take a daily supplement. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, the benefits of supplementation with 2 or 10 μg of B12/d for 4 and 12 mo were tested in 300 individuals from Indian families, of whom 48% were B12 deficient at baseline ( 211).After 12 mo plasma B12 increased by 64% with 2 μg/d and 119% after 10 μg/d, an increase similar to that at 4 mo.At 12 mo tHcy fell by 5.0 µmol/L in the 2 μg/d group and 7.1 µmol/L in the 10 μg/d group.Plasma B12 was higher in the 10 μg/d group, but few participants in either group remained deficient.Adding folic acid made no difference to the change in tHcy.
In a follow- up study, recovery in response to a high dose of 500 μge v e r y other day for 6 wk was evaluated in vegetarian Indian women (212). Within 2 wk, tHcy fell from 18.0 to 13.0 µmol/L where it remained for the next 4 wk at a concentration achieved within 4 mo after the 2 μg/d dosage.These studies support the observation that the efficiency of B12 absorption from doses between 1 and 2 μgi s∼50%, but falls to 1% with high doses.Public health interventions to prevent B12 deficiency B12 is a constituent of micronutrient powders, lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs), and multiple micronutrient sup- plements distributed in many LMICs to prevent micronutrient deficiencies.
Randomized controlled trials show that providing recommended amounts of B12 in such supplements increases adult and infant serum, and human milk concentrations of the vitamin, although not by a substantial amount, as highlighted in the studies listed in Text Box 18 that have tested the efficacy of B12 supplements. TextBox18 StudiesofB12supplementationfordietary deficiency Nepal (213): in pregnant women provided with B12 in multiple micronutrient supplements from early preg- nancy, serum B12 in late pregnancy was 30 pmol/L higher and the prevalence of deficiency (serum B12 <150 pmol/L) was reduced by 35% compared with controls.Importantly, however, 45% of the supplemented women still had concentrations <150 pmol/L.Bangladesh ( 214): 2.6 μg/d B12 included in a supple- ment for pregnant women increased serum B12 by ∼30 pmol/L in infants at 6 mo of age.

India (96): 50 μg/d provided during pregnancy increased plasma concentrations by ∼100 pmol/L in the second and third trimesters, and by 60 pmol/L in infants at age 6 wk.Breast-milk B12 at 6 wk postpartum was 87 pmol/L in the placebo group compared with 136 pmol/L in the supplemented group. Food-based interventions There are few studies of the effect of food fortification on B12 status.In general, status is better in people consuming B12- fortified cereals, especially those who do not consume animal source foods.Interest is increasing in B12 fortification of staple commodities such as flour, especially in LMICs with a high prevalence of deficiency.Guidelines for the fortification of flour with B12 have been developed by the Food Fortification Initiative ( 217,218), and approved by the WHO.
Reasons to fortify flour with B12 include the high prevalence of depletion and deficiency of the vitamin that occurs in all age groups in LMICs owing to low intake, and in elderly worldwide who need a source of the crystalline vitamin. Moreover, because flour in most countries is now fortified with folic acid, cofortification with B12 wouldeliminate any of the still-controversial concerns about high folate status exacerbating B12 deficiency ( 31,37).The recommendation is to add 20 μg/kg flour assuming consumption of 75–100 g flour/d.This would provide 75– 100% of the EAR.Adding more than this amount may add too much to the cost of the flour.The vitamin should be added to the vitamin-mineral premix in a carrier to ensure that the very small amounts can be distributed evenly through the flour.
The efficacy and effectiveness of this strategy have not been widelytested.Interestingly,whentherecommendedamountwas addedtowheatflourinCameroon,wheretheprevalenceofB12 deficiency is high,there was a very pronounced impact on both serum and breast-milk B12,greater than is seen with high-dose supplements( 219).Itispossiblethatsmalldosesthroughoutthe day in a staple food are absorbed more efficiently than larger doses as a supplement.More studies are needed to establish the appropriate amount of fortification.

Computer- based methods are now available for data collection and entry, including self-administration by the participant ( 113,221). A web-based Automated Self-Administered 24-h recall method has been developed by the National Cancer Institute in the United States, based on the Automated Multiple-Pass Method developed by the USDA for use in NHANES ( 222).It providesonline assistance and images of portion sizes and is feasible for low-literacy populations.The intake of B12 may be very variable from day to day and average intakes will be greatly affected if foods rich in the vitamin,such as liver,are consumed during the assessment period.Thus it is recommended that several days of intake data should be collected on each individualandthatintakesshouldbeexpressedasmedians,and correction be applied for day-to-day variation in intake among population groups ( 223,224).
The distribution of B12 intakes in a population is usually highly skewed so data need to be 2014S Supplement normalized before statistical analysis of the relation between intake and biomarkers of status, for example. Consumption of the vitamin in fortified foods and in supplements should be captured when assessing usual intakes.Intermittent consumption of these sources will require assess- ment over more days, or their estimation from an FFQ that refers to intake over the past week, for example.The actual content of nutrients in supplements may be different from the amount on the label,a situation that is addressed by the federal Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database.The most common amount of B12 in a supplement is ∼6μg and the difference between the labeled and analyzed content is only 2.9%.The B12 status of users of supplements or fortified foods is higher than that of nonusers.
Because the absorption of crystalline B12 is only slightly greater than that of the same amount of food B12, there is typically no correction made for differential bioavailability of the 2 forms. Because dietary sources of B12 are limited to animal source foods (except for fortified foods), estimates of usual consumption of animal products, for example times per day, week, or month, can provide useful information on the risk of inadequate intakes among individuals in households and among population groups.In many surveys and studies,animal source food intake is significantly associated with B12 status (150,225).Importantly, when faced with an individual with biochemical evidence of poor B12 status, clinicians should question whether a low intake of animal source foods might be responsible.
The effectiveness of different biomarkers of B12 status to detectachangeinB12intakewasassessedthroughasystematic review of 8 published randomized controlled trials of oral B12 supplementation ( 226).All studies measured serum and plasma total B12, 3 studies measured MMA, and 6 measured total homocysteine response. All 3 indicators were responsive to a change in B12 intake.Relation between B12 intake and status In many studies, including those from the United States and Europe, dietary intake and plasma concentrations of B12 are quite strongly and positively correlated.For example, in Massachusetts plasma B12 and dietary intakes were assessed in 2999 adult participants.Mean intake of B12 was 9 μg/d and individuals with higher plasma B12 ( >185 pmol/L compared with<148 pmol/L) had higher intakes of the vitamin from all food sources ( 144).
However, plasma B12 reached a plateau at intakes >10μg/d.Overall,foreachdoublingofB12intakethere was a 45-pmol/L increase in plasma B12 with no difference among supplements, fortified cereals, or other foods. In those not taking supplements a doubling of B12 intake from all sourcescombinedwasassociatedwith34pmol/Lhigherplasma B12, but the increment per unit intake was higher for dairy products (39 pmol/L),less for fortified cereals (24 pmol/L),and only 12 pmol/L for meat, fish, and poultry.This suggests supe- riorabsorptionofB12fromdairyproducts,inwhichitisbound to transcobalamin ( 227).However, in a randomized controlled trial in which meat and milk supplements were compared as a source of the vitamin for Kenyan schoolchildren, there was no difference in the effect on serum B12 at the end of 1 y ( 150).
A Norwegian study also investigated the association of dietary intake of different food items with plasma B12 concentrationsinthegeneralpopulation( 228).PlasmaB12was associated with increasing amounts of B12 from dairy products or fish ( Pfor trend <0.001 for both) but not with intakes of the vitamin from meat or eggs.For the same content of B12,intakefrom dairy products was associated with the greatest increment in plasma B12. These findings are based on a cross-sectional, population-based study of 5937 subjects in 2 age groups (47– 49 and 71–74 y) from the Hordaland Homocysteine Study in Norway,with intake measured by an FFQ.In a similar study of Dutchelderly,higherserumB12concentrationswereassociated with higher intakes of dairy,meat,fish,and shellfish,with meat and milk—predominantly milk—being the most potent sources (229).The relation between B12 intake, serum B12, and the other biomarkers of status was examined in a US study ( 230).
As seen inFigure 7 , serum concentrations of B12, MMA, and tHcy all tended to reach a plateau at an intake of ∼4–7μg/d in persons aged 18–50 y who had normal absorption of the vitamin. The same group had reported similar results from Danish postmenopausal women where an intake of 6 μg/d normalized B12-related biomarkers ( 231).In the systematic review of daily losses compared with intake of B12, estimated intakes needed to compensate for losses of 1.4–5.1 μg/d were 3.8–20.7 μg/d (118).These estimates agree with both the US (144) and Norwegian ( 228) studies in which maximum plasma B12 concentrations were found at a B12 intake of 6–10 μg/d.
Togetherthesestudiesraisethepossibilitythatrecommended intakesofthevitaminshouldbehigher.However,thefunctional benefits of long-term intakes above the current RDAs for persons with normal absorption of the vitamin remain to be determined, especially because in B12-deficient Indians supplementedwitheither2 μg/dor10 μg/dofthevitamin,there were no differences in the effect of the dosages on reductions in tHcy at 4–6 or 12 mo after supplementation ( 211). Moreover, in a large ( n=2919) study of the relation between B12 intake and biomarkers in Dutch elderly, saturation of the biomarkers occurred with intakes >5μgB 1 2(232).The strong relation between B12 intake and status is further supported by studies of different types of vegetarians.
Data on usual diet and serum B12 were analyzed from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)- Oxford study in the United Kingdom, categorizing 689 men as omnivores (3 servings of meat/wk, n=226), lacto-ovo vegetarians ( n=231), and vegans ( n=232) (233). Serum B12 (mean and 95% CI) was 281 pmol/L (270, 292 pmol/L)inomnivores,182pmol/L(175,189pmol/L)invegetar- ians,and 122pmol/L(117,127 pmol/L)in vegans.In Germany, B12status(includingplasmaB12)wasbetterinomnivoresthan in lacto- or lacto-ovo vegetarians,who in turn had better status than ovo-vegetarians, with strict vegetarians (vegans) having the poorest status ( 234).Notably, tHcy and MMA increased consistently as animal source food intake fell and were elevated in>60% of vegetarians.Thus, not only vegans can become depleted in B12; there is a higher risk of B12 deficiency even in lacto- or lacto-ovo vegetarians than in omnivores.
Serum/plasma B12 Total B12 concentration in serum or plasma is most commonly used as the biomarker of B12 status. Total B12 includes both the metabolically active cobalamin bound to transcobalamin (holoTC), which delivers B12 to body cells, and cobalamin bound to haptocorrin.Serum B12 reflects the general amount of B12 stores and is a useful indicator of B12 status although it lacks sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing B12 deficiency (235,236).Concentrations are expressed as pmol/L or as pg/mL with the latter most often used in clinical practice (1.0 pg/mL =0.7378 pmol/L).Serum/plasma B12 is useful for assessing long-term status (body stores) and is relatively BOND—Vitamin B-12 review 2015S FIGURE 7 Relation between B12 intake and serum biomarker concentrations.Reproduced with permission from reference 230.

It is the component that delivers the vitamin to cells and is therefore a potentially better marker of the adequacy of B12 for its metabolic functions,and sometimes referred to as “active vitamin B-12.”However,in general,stud- ies comparing the specificity and sensitivity of holoTC against serum MMA have found only slightly better performance of holoTC.In 5 studies comparing holoTC and serum B12 for the diagnosis of B12 deficiency defined by elevated MMA, holoTC performed slightly better ( 238). But in a group of vegan men, holoTC and serum B12 had similar specificity and sensitivity for predicting B12 deficiency (defined as MMA >0.75µmol/L and tHcy >15µmol/L) (239).The analysis suggested that when holoTC is <25 pmol/L B12 deficiency is likely, but if >50 pmol/L, deficiency is unlikely.Values in the intermediate range need follow-up and further testing.
Concentrations in serum increase by 6 h after a dose or meal so holoTC is a better marker of recent intake than serum B12, MMA, or tHcy. This has led to the development of theCobaSorb and C-Cobasorb tests for B12 absorption which measure holoTC or cyanocobalamin-transcobalamin response to 3 doses of B12 administered over 1–2 d ( 162,163).A daily oral dose of 500 μg produces a maximal increase in holoTC after 3 d, and no further increase after 84 d ( 240).In population studies there is little difference in the prevalence of deficiency using serum B12 or holoTC ( 37,241), although different individuals may be classified differently by the 2 biomarkers ( 241).As is true for the other biomarkers, low holoTC concentrations are more prevalent in populations consuming low amounts of B12 ( 231) and less animal source foods (242).
There remains uncertainty about the cutoff that should be used to diagnose deficiency.Although cutoffs around 35–45pmol/Lareoftenusedinclinicalpracticeandinresearch, in a large clinical study there was no association between holoTCandMMAintherangeof25–50pmol/L( 243).HoloTC is elevated in individuals with impaired renal function ( 244) but unaffected by pregnancy ( 245,246), so it may be a better biomarker of B12 status in pregnancy ( 247). Serum MMA Serum MMA is considered to be a relatively specific and sensitive biomarker of B12 status.Serum MMA concentrations reflect the adequacy of B12 status for the biochemical function of the enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase which is required for the conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA; MMA, usually a side-reaction product of methylmalonyl CoA metabolism,increaseswithB12depletion.Themetaboliteisnot affected by the status of folate or other B vitamins.It is a good indicator of B12 stores but not of recent B12 intake.
Higher 2016S Supplement concentrations of serum MMA occur with impaired renal function so that should also be assessed, e.g., by measurement ofserumcreatinine,especiallyintheelderly.Thegutmicrobiota produce propionic acid which can be converted to MMA, and thus serum MMA can increase with intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and be lowered by antibiotics in this condition (248). Differences in the type or quantity of bacteria in the intestinemayexplainthegenerallyhigherMMAconcentrations inlower-incomepopulationsrelativetoserumB12( 249),which persist even after B12 supplementation ( 241,250).MMA increases with aging, especially after age 70 y; neither lower intake nor impaired renal function entirely explain why this occurs.There is an inflection point for serum MMA which increasessubstantiallyaroundserumB12concentrationsof150 nmol/L ( 251).
However, models based on NHANES data and controlling for known covariates revealed 2 inflection points, 281 nmol/L at serum B12 <126 pmol/L which was determined to indicate true deficiency,and 120 nmol/L at serum B12 >287 pmol/L where status was likely adequate ( 252). The status of the intermediate group was indeterminate.UrinaryMMA isalsoincreasedinB12deficiency andavoids the need for blood collection.Values should be expressed per mg or mmol creatinine to correct for variability in urine concentration,thus2analysesarerequired.Total24-hexcretion avoids this problem, but accurate 24-h collection may be difficult to achieve.A limitation of urinary MMA is that it increases after meals.Plasma total homocysteine tHcy is increased as a result of B12 deficiency owing to insufficient amounts of the vitamin for the activity of me- thionine synthase,which converts homocysteine to methionine.
ConcentrationsarerelativelyunaffectedbymildB12deficiency, butriserapidlywhenplasmaB12fallsbelow300pmol/L( 251). It can be considered a test of the adequacy of the vitamin for enzyme function.However, because folate, riboflavin, and vitamin B-6 deficiencies result in elevations of tHcy, as do renal insufficiency and hypothyroidism, it is not a specific biomarker for B12 status especially in populations with poor micronutrient status.In contrast, in generally well-nourished populations where flour is fortified with folic acid (which is now a widespread global practice), B12 deficiency may be the main cause of elevated tHcy ( 253).In US elderly the population attributable risk that elevated tHcy is due to B12 deficiency is ∼30%.AfallintHcycanconfirmanimprovementinB12status due to supplementation or fortification programs.More details of the measurement and interpretation of tHcy are provided in the companion BOND report on folate ( 22).
Data Interpretation and Diagnostic Cutoffs Diagnostic cutoffs and ranges have been proposed for all 4 biomarkers,and are summarized in Table 6.Cutoffs are needed forestimatingtheprevalenceofdeficiencyinpopulationgroups, but in clinical practice it is often more useful to refer to information on the reference range of values. The cutoffs and ranges for B12 status all are somewhat controversial owing to the high prevalence of subclinical B12 deficiency and limited data linking these to functional outcomes.The primary “gold standard” for setting cutoffs has been serum MMA because it is the most sensitive and specific marker of status.Even then,there remains debate about the MMA concentrations to use when setting cutoffs for the other biomarkers.
It is clear that cutoffs and ranges for all 4 biomarkers should be different for infants, based on longitudinal data from well-nourished Norwegianinfants( 131,254).Therearemarkedchangesduring the first year of life.Serum B12 and holoTC are generally lower than in adults, and MMA is especially elevated at ∼6m oo f age, at a time when breast-milk B12 concentrations are lowest. Status of all 4 biomarkers is consistently better in formula-fed than in breastfed infants, although whether this is functionally important is not clear and this situation occurs even when mothersareB12sufficient.MMAconcentrationsincreaseinthe elderly independently of the effects of chronic kidney disease (133) for reasons that are not understood.
The diagnosis of B12 deficiency in individuals and especially theestimatedprevalenceofB12deficiencyinpopulationgroups is often very different depending on which indicator is selected, andmaybecontradictory( 9,241,255).Thisisnotsurprisingin that each marker responds differently to stage of deficiency and age. Clinicians usually use serum B12 as the initial indicator to screen for deficiency, and follow up with additional markers if deficiency is suspected ( 235,256,257).Ratios of 2 biomarkers have also been used: the ratio of holoTC to serum B12 was a stronger predictor of cognitive function in depressed elderly than was either indicator individually ( 56).Serum or plasma B12 Forinfantsandyoungchildrentherangesarevaluesforhealthy breastfeeding Norwegian infants and children to 2 y of age (131).Concentrations fall between birth and 6 mo,after which they increase.
Values are higher in nonbreastfed infants ( 131, 254) accompanied by lower MMA and tHcy, but whether this difference is functionally significant is still unknown. Formulas and cow milk contain more B12 than does breast milk.Below 75 pmol/L (severe deficiency), ∼50% of people will have clinically diagnosable symptoms ( 258).Serum B12 cutoffs for deficiency typically range from 120 to 180 pmol/L (depending on the assay used), with the most common cutoff being 148 pmol/L ( 15).The criteria for setting the cutoff for deficiency at <150 pmol/L in adults in Table 6 are that 98% of a group will have elevated MMA ( >376 nmol/L which is 3 SD above normal values in NHANES) ( 252), and 40–50% in the 75– 150 pmol/L range will have clinically diagnosed symptoms (258).With concentrations of 150–250 pmol/L adults are assumed to be depleted in the vitamin, with some individuals probably deficient, and an increased risk of clinical and metabolic dysfunction across this range.
In NHANES 2.5–5% of individuals were diagnosed as B12 deficient (serum B12 <148 pmol/L and MMA >271 nmol/L). Adequacy is likely >250pmol/LbasedonnormalMMAconcentrations.However, it has been suggested that the risk of cognitive impairment and white matter damage in the elderly is elevated even when serum B12 is within 250–350 pmol/L ( 50).In pregnancy there is a 25–30% fall in concentration between 20 and 30 weeks of gestation ( 245), caused by altered B12 binding to haptocorrin rather than hemodilution (246,259).The fall is unlikely to indicate true depletion becauseholoTCdoesnotchangeandserumB12concentrations recover by 14 wk postpartum ( 245).Reference values are not differentforolderadultsbecauseunlikeMMA,serumB12does not change substantially with age in healthy, well-nourished individuals ( Figure 4).

The >376 nmol/L cutoff for adults is a concentration found in only 2.4% of US elderly with normal renal function, whereas >271 pmol/L is seen in 5.9% of the same group ( 260).Renal insufficiency greatly increases serum MMA, so renal function must be evaluated based on serum creatinine, for example, especially in the elderly who are at high risk of chronic kidney disease.Normal serum creatinine concentrations are generally accepted to be 0.6–1.1 mg/dL for womenand0.7–1.3mg/dLformen.SerumMMAconcentration increaseswithageeveninthosewithnormalrenalfunction,and much more so than serum B12 ( Figure 4).Plasma homocysteine Cutoffs for plasma homocysteine concentrations are provided in the BOND Folate Review ( 22).
Multiple analyte testing As reviewed above, no single blood biomarker provides suffi- cient sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing B12 deficiency in all people. In recent years, there has been movement toward multiple analyte testing to address this problem ( 239,244, 261–263 ).Some strategies use sequential algorithms, whereby B12 status is initially assessed by serum B12 or holoTC.If these analytes are low (e.g., B12 <148 pmol/L or holoTC <35 pmol/L), then B12 deficiency is diagnosed.If these analytes are in an indeterminate range (e.g., B12 between 148 and 250 pmol/L or holoTC between 35 and 50 pmol/L), then a functional indicator of status, MMA or tHcy, is measured and if elevated then B12 deficiency is diagnosed.An alternative strategy is to measure ≥2 of these analytes simultaneously.These strategies have the putative advantage of increased specificity and sensitivity, but also increase the expense of screening and diagnosis.
Most recently a model has been developed that enables calculation of a “combined B12” indicator (cB12) of B12 status from values for all 4 status biomarkers (serum B12, MMA, holoTC, and tHcy) ( 255). It is based on a pooleddatabase of 5211 participants in 9 studies with a range of B12 and folate status, and the cutoffs for cB12 are validated against hemoglobin concentrations and cognitive status (the Mini Mental State Examination).It has now been adapted for use with 3 or 2 of these biomarkers because measurement of 4 biomarkers can be prohibitively expensive in some situations, and for application when folate status is poor resulting in increased tHcy ( 9).The algorithm is also age-adjusted recognizing that MMA increases in the elderly.The general 4-component algorithm is expressed as cB12 =log10[(holoTC ·B12)/(MMA ·Hcy)] – (age factor), and the formulas that allow for 1 or 2 missing biomarkers are provided in the article.
Suggested interpretations and cutoffs for cB12 are presented in Table 7. These need to be validated in additional studies against not only hemoglobin and the Mini Mental State Examination, but using other cognitive and neurologic outcomes.The combined indicator detected increased risk of cognitive impairment in UK elderly ( 62), biochemical and neurologic responses to B12 supplementation of deficient Chilean elderly, and a negative interaction between neurologic response and folate status which was not detected through the use of any of the biomarkers individually ( 37).Analytic Methods The most commonly used valid assays for serum or plasma B12, holoTC, and MMA are summarized in Table 8.Analytic methods used for the measurement of tHcy are provided in detail in the BOND Folate Report ( 22).Earlier radioisotopic dilution assays for serum and plasma B12 measured some of the nonbiologically active analogs of cobalamin and therefore overestimated actual concentrations.
This situation was avoided by the inclusion of IF as a reagent, which only binds to cobalamin. Radioassays have largely been displaced by immunoenzymatic assays, although these should not be used to measure serum B12 in patients with pernicious anemia because IF antibodies in their serum interfere with the binding of B12 to the IF used in the assay ( 264).The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed serum-based standard reference materials (SRMs) for use as control materials.These improve the accuracy and reliability of analyses because they enable calibration of each laboratory’s methods and values against the reference value.SRM 3951 Vitamin B-12 in Human Serum consists of 3 sera with different B12concentrations,100pg/mL,200pg/mL,and450pg/mL(74, 148, and 332 pmol/L).SRM 1955 is available for tHcy.There arenoNationalInstituteofStandardsandTechnologyreference materials for MMA or holoTC.

Preanalytic effects on biomarker concentrations Valuable information on the effects of fasting, inflammation, renal function, and pregnancy on serum B12, MMA, and tHcy was obtainedfromNHANES,based ona representativesample of the US adult population ( Table 4)(178).Data were available from 1400–9000 participants and additional covariates were controlled for in multiple regression analyses.HoloTC was not analyzed.Fastingisgenerallynotrequired,butifpossibleshould be required for MMA analyses. Estimates of biological variability were also obtained from NHANES ( 182).The imprecision of the selected laboratory method should be less than half of the CV.Based on the within-person CVs in Table 4, this is quite achievable.
All 4 B12 biomarkers can be analyzed on relatively small sample volumesandarequitestableduringhandlingandstorage.When whole blood is stored at 32 °C for 1 or 2 d there is a 10 pmol/L increase in serum B12, and a 4 pmol/L increase after 3d,comparedwithserumseparatedwithi n2handimmediately frozen (265). For tHcy analysis, plasma should be separated rapidly to avoid leakage from RBCs, and serum is usually not recommended because clotting at room temperature will cause an increase in tHcy.However,tHcy is stable if whole blood in a vacutaineriskeptonicefor ≤6hbeforecentrifugation.ForB12 and MMA, there is no influence of the type of anticoagulant (serum, serum separator, plasma EDTA, plasma Na heparin, or plasma citrate), but lithium heparin can sometimes produce gelatinous serum and elevated B12 concentrations.
It is usually recommended that samples are protected from light during collection and separation; a study of this question found the mean fall in serum B12 was ∼7.5% in both light-protected and unprotected tubes when stored at room temperature or at 2–8 °C for 1, 2, or 7 d ( 266). Other Biomarkers Other markers of B12 adequacy sometimes used for research purposes can include DNA methylation, uracil misincorpora-tion into DNA, and measurement of micronuclei.These are not specific to B12 deficiency, and are described in detail in the BOND Folate Report.B12 concentrations in breast milk might be useful for assessing maternal B12 status and the risk ofinadequateintakeofthevitaminbybreastfedinfants,andfor monitoring and evaluating B12 intervention programs,but this requiresfurtherconfirmationincludingestablishingappropriate times postpartum for milk collection.
New Directions and Technologies TheBONDFolateReportprovidesadescriptionoftheconcepts underlying the use of “omics” (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) to improve our understanding of the functional impacts of vitamin deficiency, and the effects of interventions to improve status. Although this is a promising area for future research, these methods are still under development and validation in the context of B12 status biomarkers ( 267).
