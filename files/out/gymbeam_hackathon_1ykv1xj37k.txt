VITAMIN B AND PEPTIC ULCER By M.NAIIASIMHA RAO, m.b., b.s.Research Fellow, Andhra University (From the Department of Biochemistry, Medical College, Vizagapatam) Diet, as a contributory factor in the aetiology of peptic ulcer, was known to the early pathol- ogists.In recent years the subject has been elaborated and various aspects of diet brought to light, and held to be responsible causative agents.Some of them were: 'carried' foods, coarse foods, ' hot' foods, foods at high tem- peratures, marked difference in the temperature of various dishes; irregular meals, meals at long intervals, etc.That diet probably is partly responsible for the frequency of peptic ulcer in India has been pointed out by McCarrison, Bradfield and Somervell.And the various ways in which the diet was accused were : increased carbohydrate content of the food; markedly low fat diet; gross deficiency of vitamins A, B and C.
Now that laboratory methods have been developed for assaying the various constituents of the food, an investigation into the diet as to its quality and deficiency can be conducted more rationally. It has been observed by the writer that the diet of the labourer, the common victim of peptic ulcer in South India, is lacking in the essential vitamins A and B, in addition to variations in the proximate principles.The present investigation has been attempted for the purpose of studying the amount of vitamin- B deficiency by microchemical techniques, in patients with peptic ulcer.Towards the biochemistry of avitaminosis B, contributions have been largely made by the Oxford school of workers.The following may be noted as their essential conclusions.In the brains of experimental polyneuritic pigeons it has been found that there was increased quan- tity of lactic acid and diminished tissue respira- tion in glucose or lactate solutions, when com- pared with healthy controls.
It has also been shown beyond doubt that diminished oxygen intake was entirely due to lack of vitamin B in the tissue (Peters, 1936). Hence they con- cluded that vitamin B was needed for the oxidative removal of lactic acid.Thus the fact was scientifically established that vitamin B was specially concerned with carbohydrate metabolism.Peters and Thompson (1934) have studied the metabolism of pyruvate in vitro and came to the conclusion that pyruvic acid, as an intermediary metabolite, was inversely propor- tional to the vitamin content of the brain.This observation on the brain was applied to other tissues of the body, especially the blood; and it was found that blood has increased inter- mediate carbohydrate metabolites, especially pyruvic acid which is formed in brain (Thomp- son and Johnson 1935).
Other intermediate carbohydrate metabolites also have been found 458 THE INDIAN MEDICAL GAZETTE [Aug., 1938 in the blood of avitaminous birds?especially methyl glyoxal?as shown by Geiger and Rosen- berg (1933), but this could not be corroborated by Gavrilescu and Peters (1931) and Johnson (1936). Johnson and others (1935) attempted to correlate the above facts for the purpose of assessing the vitamin deficiency of an individual by estimating the pyruvic acid in blood.They established the level in normal patients but could find no person with B deficiency in England for investigation.But in China, Piatt and Lu (1935) published their observations of the presence of pyruvic acid in the blood of beriberi patients.Subsequently they (1936) confirmed beyond doubt that the same can be applied as a fairly accurate laboratory test for the avita- minosis B.Many methods have been advocated for estimating the pyruvate in blood.
A qualitative one can be used?a modified Rothera's test with nitroprusside and strong ammonia?a blue-green colour indicates the presence of pyruvic acid. Other tests are those of Simon and Piaux's, and Posternak's quoted by Case.Quantitatively various methods of estimation are available.1.MacLean's method.Precipitation of pyruvic acid with phenyl hydrazine and sub- sequent estimation of unchanged hydrazine.2.Clift and Cook's method (1932) is based on the capacity of binding bisulphite.Each method has its own advantages and dis- advantages according to the medium in which the pyruvic acid is contained; namely, muscle filtrate, blood or cerebrospinal fluid.The two methods used in the present investiga- tion are modified MacLean's and Cook's.The disadvantage of the first method is in the proper extraction of the hydrazone of the pyruvic acid from the blood, the advantage being that pyruvic acid can be estimated as such.
Whereas, in the second method the advantage is the amount of accuracy obtained, with the disadvantage that the pyruvic acid is estimated as an unknown quantity of the bisulphite-binding substances in the blood; the proportions of the remaining variable moieties being also unknown. But with the idea of having a clearer reading of the results by a harmonious combination of both the methods it was attempted to use both the methods together and the attempt was only partly successful.Pyruvic acid.?The estimations were done by Case's method (1932).Peter's and Thompson's modification (1934) was also tried but was found to be less efficient, due to the following reasons :?1.Large quantities of ethyl acetate have to be used.2.The extractions are greater in number and not quite satisfactory and demarcative.3.Greater time is required.Case's method involves the following principle :?
Excess of 2:4 dinitrophenyl hydrazine is added to the deproteinized extract of the blood (the blood being taken under basal conditions)- Pyruvic acid hydrazone along with other hyd1'^' zones is formed in the solution and with tn uncombined hydrazine are extracted wl ! ethyl acetate.Neutralization of the acids use for deproteinization is done to prevent the sut>' sequent extraction of liydrazones other than tha of pyruvic acid.Neutralization of the ethy acetate extract instead of the preliminary ^VK chloracetic acid extract is done to facilitate rap1 instead of repeated extractions with ethyl ace- tate.The combined liydrazones are evaporate and extracted with toluene, which gives them up more readily than ethyl acetate.The pyruV.lC acid moiety is extracted from the others }n toluene with cold sodium carbonate, which dis- solves only the pyruvic acid hydrazone in tn?cold.
The 2 : 4 dinitrophenyl hydrazone 0 pyruvic acid is extracted from the carbonate after acidification with ethyl acetate and crys- tallized. The estimate is done by the color1' metric method against a standard 2 : 4 dinitro- phenyl hydrazone of pyruvic acid, the solven being alcoholic potash which gives a deep re colour.Experimental details.?The patient is not pennit|-e^ to take any solid or liquid food subsequent to previous night's dinner.The morning coffee ^ allowed in some cases.Rest in bed is essential in ?morning till the time of taking blood, the idea to eliminate errors due to intermediate products ^ carbohydrate metabolism, resulting from exercise; to 3 c.cm.of blood are taken and immediately trans ferred to a weighed centrifuge tube containing 7 c: ^ of 5 per cent trichloracetic acid solution, lBlPn thoroughly, and the exact amount of blood added obtained by reweighing.

An attempt has been made to find the bisulphite-binding substances values in healthy labour classes, as the majority of the 30 cases studied is from the same classes. Table III Serial number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Values of bisulphite- binding substances 4.7 3.1 2.7* 5.2* 3.3 3.1 6.353 4.580 3.228 3.906 1.704 3.354 1.457 * These cases could not be studied under basal conditions.Thus it is seen that considering the 11 cases done under ideal conditions the bisulphite-bind- ing substances values vary from 1.457 to a maximum of 6.353, the average being 3.457 mgm.Piatt and Lu report the content of the blood in established beriberi cases to be marked- ly increased.But in none of the cases have they reported values higher than 10 mgm.per cent.But in this connection it must be men- tioned that some of the ' gastric ' cases showed values higher than 10.An attempt has been made to find the corresponding values of beri- beri cases admitted to the hospital.
Seven cases showing marked avitaminosis B were studied and the values are noted hereunder (table IV)- Table IV Serial number Values 9.4 7.7 7.7 4.3 6.7 15.08 4.91 It is interesting to note that one of the cases (6) has shown a value of above 15, and others, except case 4, show uniformly high values. Of the bisulphite-binding substances content of ' peptic ulcer' patients excluding cases 7 and 12, where there was much unavoidable experi- mental error, the variation is from 2.1 to a maximum of 23.73.Fixing the maximum in a normal individual as 4.8, as judged from the healthy students, nine of the values are within the normal range and the remaining ones beyond it; so much so that it appears that higher bisulphite-binding substances values are fairly frequent in Aug., 1938] TREATMENT OF PHRYNODERMA : RADHAKRISHNA RAO 461 these patients.But this observation is n?t without possibilities of error, the chief .
which is the presumption that the pyruvic *cid nioiety of the bisulphite-binding sub- stances always bears the same high percent- age to the "total. But from the readings in iable II it appears it is not quite true.The nervations on this aspect are so meagre that le discussion on the subject cannot be complete, ut frorn ^-jie pr00f advanced so far by Piatt nci Lu (1836) that bisulphite-binding sub- - ances values run parallel to the vitamin-B ^ ciency it may be concluded with a fair ' of certainty that these patients are tr ,?rinS from partial avitaminosis B.The bv+v ^le statement may be substantiated Wc ?, that it is in these lower classes that iiberi is fairly common., lle discussion of the subject on the basis of mpS+ findinSs and findings of animal experi- n will be given in another paper.Summary pe^,isuiphite-binding substances in blood of ^ P Jc ulcer patients are found to be increased defi1 8?od percentage of cases, showing a definite ciency of vitamin B in these patients.
