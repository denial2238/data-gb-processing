The intrinsic quality of ginger may differ due to variations in its origin and processing techniques. To evaluate thequality of ginger, a straightforward and ef ﬁcient discriminatory approach has been devised, utilizing 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, and 10-gingerol as benchmarks.Methods: In order to categorize ginger samples according to their cultivated origins with different longitude and latitude (Shandong, Anhui, and Yunnanprovinces in China) and processing methods (liquid nitrogen pulverization,ultra-micro grinding, and mortar grinding), similarity analysis (SA), hierarchicalcluster analysis (HCA), and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed.Furthermore, there was a quantitative determination of the signi ﬁcant marker compounds gingerols, which has considerable impact on maintaining qualitycontrol and distinguishing ginger products accurately.
Moreover, discrimination analysis (DA) was utilized to further distinguish and classify samples with unknown membership degrees based on the eigenvalues, with the aim of achieving optimaldiscrimination between groups. Results: Theﬁndings obtained from the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data revealed that the levels of various gingerols present in all samplesexhibited signi ﬁcant variations.The study con ﬁrmed that the quality of ginger was primarily in ﬂuenced by its origin and processing method, with the former being the dominant factor.Notably, the sample obtained from Anhui province andsubjected to liquid nitrogen pulverization demonstrated the highest content ofgingerols.Conclusion: The results obtained from the analysis of SA, HCA, PCA, and DA were consistent and could be employed to evaluate the quality of ginger.

Additionally, ginger is highly sought after in the perfume industry due to its abundance of volatile essential oils ( Marak et al., 2019 ). As a result of the copious amounts of vitamins contained within ginger, it is commonly utilized as a ﬂavoring component in candies and beverages (Sangwan et al., 2014 ).As per the research ﬁndings, the pungent taste of ginger is a result of the presence of shogaols and gingerols.Moreover, theunique ﬂavor of ginger can be attributed to the volatility and pungency of its essential oil ( Yamaguchi et al., 2010 ).Simultaneously, ginger is also a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that has been widelyutilized in clinical settings due to its m edicinal and nutritional properties.
As a medicine-food homology, ging er possesses various health bene ﬁts such as bacteriostasis, detoxi ﬁcation, anti-in ﬂammatory properties, hypolipidemia, anti-oxidant properties, and tumor suppression(Shanmugam et al., 2011 ;Funk et al., 2016 ;Kim et al., 2018 ; Mahomoodally et al., 2021 ). The advantageous health properties of ginger have been attributed to an array of functional components,including gingerol, shogaol, phenolic elements, purine compounds,ginger oil, volatile oils, active pol ysaccharides, and glycoproteins (Levita et al., 2018 ).The primary constituent of ginger is gingerol, which comprises 6-gingerol, 8-gingero l, and 10-gingerol, with 6-gingerol constituting over 75% of the total composition ( Liu et al., 2019 ).Gingerols convert into their cor responding shogaols after being subjected to long-term storage or heat treatment, resulting in themanifestation of high levels of antioxidant activity ( Ballester et al., 2022).
Nevertheless, the constituent s and composition of ginger were substantially in ﬂuenced by elements such as localities, climates, and soil environments ( Gaur et al., 2016 ). These factors directly affect the unique ﬂavor of ginger and its medical and health effects.The speci ﬁcc o n d i t i o n s of cultivation and various processing methods are crucial factors indetermining the active constituents that de ﬁne its distinct characteristics(Chen et al., 2019 ).In light of the consistent increase in the utilization and consumption of ginger, it is of utmost importance to establish anappropriate methodology for the development of quality controlmeasures.The Chinese Pharmacopoeia (China PharmacopoeiaCommittee, 2020) is identi ﬁed 6-gingerol as the marker compound for evaluating the quality of ginger.However, ginger is composed of a multitude of intricate constituent s beyond this singular compound.
Consequently, relying solely on one component as the standard forquality evaluation is inadequate. It is therefore imperative to include more effective ingredients in the eva luation process, rather than relying on a single compound.The utilization of chemometric methodologies, particularly principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), has facilitated the systematic acquisition of chemical pro ﬁles that have a broad range of applications in the classi ﬁcation and identi ﬁcation of medicinal compounds.These techniques have been extensively employed in the analysis of thechemical composition of herbal medicines ( Guo et al., 2018 ).Furthermore, the application of high-performance liquidchromatography (HPLC) in combination with multivariatestatistical methods has been utilized to discriminate and classify various constituents ( Miao et al., 2019 ).
Chromatographic ﬁngerprinting was considered as a reliable method to evaluate the quality of traditional Chinese medicine ( Cui et al., 2016 ). In addition, the TCM ﬁngerprint is internationally recognized for the evaluation and quality control of TCM and related products.To summarize, the constituents of gingerols involved in processing have the potential to greatly affect the ultimate innateexcellence of ginger.The established methods for evaluating quality do not suf ﬁce in meeting the needs of industry progress and quality appraisal.The present study employs a variety of chemometricmethods, such as SA, HCA, PCA, and DA, to analyze the HPLCﬁngerprint pro ﬁles of ginger, with a particular emphasis on the active substances of 6, 8, and 10-gingerols, in order to evaluate thequality of ginger.Furthermore, standard samples were utilized todetermine the contents of markers.
Through the integration ofstoichiometric techniques and ﬁngerprint analysis, the in ﬂuence of the production area and processing processes on the intrinsic quality of ginger was systematically examined. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals Ginger reference substance: 6-gingerol (lot number: 111833 –201806, purity >99.9%) was purchased from National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, 8-gingerol (lot number: Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org 02Wang et al.10.3389/fchem.2023.1296712 CHB 180305, purity >98%) and 10-gingerol (lot number: CHB 180311, purity >98%) were purchased from Chengdu Chroma- Biotech Co., Ltd.Their structures were shown in Figure 1 .The deionized water was generated by a laboratory water puri ﬁcation system (HITECH Instruments CO., Ltd).The acetic acid was ofanalytical grade purchased from Shanghai Runjie Chemical Reagent Co.Ltd.
Other chemicals, like methanol (lot number: 34860-4L-R) and acetonitrile (lot number: 134752), were HPLC grade andobtained by Sigma-Aldrich Shanghai Co, Ltd. and Beijing J&KScienti ﬁc Ltd., respectively.2.2 Ginger samples Three kinds of ginger samples were collected from the south (Jietou town, Qujing city, Yu nnan province), middle (Tianmen Town, Tongling City, Anhui Province) and north (TanchengCounty, Linyi City, Shandong Pro vince) of China, respectively (Table 1 ).In our work, 5 batches of ginger from Shandong, 6 batches of ginger from Anhui and 6 batches of ginger fromYunnan were used in the experiment.Professor Xie Dongmei hasauthenticated all samples fro m the Department of Pharmacy of Anhui University of Chinese medicine (Anhui, China).Theywere identi ﬁed as the dried rhizome of ginger and complied with ofﬁcial Chinese pharmacopeia (China Pharmacopoeia Committee, 2020).
2.3 Sample preparation First of all, scissors were used to cut haphazardly selected ginger from every origin into thin strips. Then strips werepulverized to powder samples through the following threemethods ( Table 1 ).1) Strips were chilled into liquid nitrogen, then pulverized with a magnetically driven impactor to let it turn into a ﬁne powder.This experiment was performed by the SPEX SamplePrep ’s Freezer/Mills.The instrument condition was as follows: run time, 1 min; cycles, 2; rate, 8 cps.2) Microchips wereput into the ST-528 Ultra-micro Crusher (Ruian saiteelectromechanical Co., Ltd.) and removed the ﬁne powder that ﬂies into the upper container.3) Ginger was placed into the mortar and ground it manually in one direction.According FIGURE 1 The HPLC ﬁngerprints of Zingiber of ﬁcinale Roce.and the characteristic spectrogram for the chromatographic ﬁngerprint of Zingiber of ﬁcinale Roce.(A)Theﬁngerprints of super ﬁne crush pre-treated ginger.

After ultrasonic, the ginger extracting solution was naturally cooled. The whole weight was weighed again to make up the lost weightwith 75% chromatogram grade met hanol.Finally, the solution wasﬁltrated through a 0.22 μm microporous ﬁlter membrane and the ﬁltration was taken as the test solution.All solutions and powders were placed in a light-proof sealed plastic bag,numbered and stored in the refrigerator at −20 °C.2.4 Apparatus and chromatographic conditions and optimization The Waters Acquity UPLC ™system was equipped with an auto- sample, a binary pump, a degasser, the 4-channel solvent degasserintegrated into the pump module, UV-Vis variable wavelengthdetector, thermostated column compartment, and connected to Waters Empower 2 software.A reverse-phase column (C 18 analytical column, 4.6 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm, WondaCract ODS-2, Japan) was carried out in the analysis.The best separation effect wasobtained in the chromatogram.
By comparing different mobile phase compositions and different mobile phase proportions and gradient conditions, the optimalchoice was ﬁnally determined. The mobile phase was composed of water containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B).The gradient program for the HPLC was as follows: 0 –15 min, 51% – 70% B; 15 –20 min, 70% –90% B; 20 –21 min, 90% –51% B; 21–24 min, 51% B.The column and the auto-sampler temperature were maintained at 25 °C.The sample injection volume was 20 μL.The UV spectrum was performed and peak absorbance was detected at 280 nm.2.5 Chemometrics analysis 2.5.1 Similarity analysis Chromatograms can make representative of all samples and have the characteristics of completeness and ambiguity.Byanalyzing the mutual mode of the chromatogram, the samplecould be well-identi ﬁed and analyzed.The contents of several chemical components were different.
It is necessary to ﬁnd possible quality markers to identify and analyze different samples(Tan et al., 2018 ). Ginger, in the same pretreatment, was categorized into a team.The HPLC chromatograms of the ginger were exported as CDF ﬁles.They imported them into a software named Similarity Evaluation System for Chromatographic Fingerprint of TraditionalChinese Medicine.The software was validated and supplied by theChinese Pharmacopoeia Committee (Version 2012.130723; Beijing,China) and analyzed the data under optimal conditions.Thesoftware calculates the mean values and generates mockchromatograms which were used as representative standard chromatograms for the ginger samples.Correlation coef ﬁcients and similarities between the means were calculated for eachmock chromatogram.
2.5.2 Hierarchical cluster analysis Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was a multivariate analysis technique that categorized samples to show the degree of correlationbetween a large number of samples ( L et al., 2011 ). Each object was the same as the other objects in a group but differed from the other objects regarding predetermined selection criteria ( Kong et al., 2009 ).Based on the subjective comparison, HCA was used to evaluate the chromatographic peaks areas of active ingredients.2.5.3 Principal component analysis Principal component analysis (PCA) can remove redundant information, reduce multidimensional data to lower dimensions, and highlight hidden features ( Liu et al., 2016 ;Chen et al., 2017 ;Guo et al., 2018 ;Ghisoni et al., 2019 ).Here, SIMCA software was used to evaluate and select the similarity evaluations, get more accurate anddetailed ﬁngerprint information.
By importing pre-processed ﬁngerprints spectrum data to the SIMCA system, quality control and ginger evaluation from different origins were established.TABLE 1 A summary of the tested sample. Sample no.

10.3389/fchem.2023.1296712 2.5.4 Discriminant analysis Tofurther trace the origin of ginger and realize the source identi ﬁcation ofginger. Discriminant analysis (DA) was a standard method to identify the sample type in multivariate statistics.Fisherdiscrimination was used in Statistical Product and Service Solutions(SPSS).3 Results and discussion 3.1 Establishment of HPLC ﬁngerprint The proportion of the acetonitrile phase was decreased to make the peak time earlier.Under the conditions reported in the literature, acetic acid was added to the water phase.The degree of sample separation was tested at different concentrations of the acetonitrileand water phase.Finally, acetonitrile and 0.1% acetic acid wereselected as the mobile phase.Gradient elution displayed a betterresolution and made each component peak well separated fromadjacent peaks.
The similarity evaluation system had excellent resolution and large areas in the HPLC ﬁngerprints, which could be regarded as the reference chromatogram to identify ginger. According to the ﬁngerprints analysis, seven common peaks were demarcated from super ﬁne samples ( Figure 1A ).Eight peaks were determined from grinding and liquid nitrogen samples of 17 batches of ginger,respectively ( Figures 1C, E ).In the three treatments, the common peaks obtained all contain 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, and 10-gingerol.3.2 Similarity analysis The system separately compared all the 17 batches of each team (Figures 1A, C, E ) to generate a reference chromatogram.The median method was utilized to compare the similarities betweenthe entire and reference chromatogram.Differences in correlationcoefﬁcients indicate the variation of the ﬁngerprint and quality of these samples ( Zhong et al., 2015 ;Li et al., 2016 ).
It indicated that it is necessary to identify all the possible quality markers to distinguish and analyze different samples. In this study, the correlationcoefﬁcient close to 1.0 indicated that the samples were entirely similar by multivariate analyzing score and loading.Table 1 showed correlation coef ﬁcients of 17 samples of ginger with different pretreatments, respectively.As shown in the similarityof grinding samples ( Supplementary Table S1A ), S6 and S7, S6 and S8, S6 and S9, S6, and S10 showed a high degree of similarity.S4 and S6, S4 and S7, S4 and S8, S4 and S9, S4, and S10 had low similarity (about 0.42).In Figure 1B , 7 related peaks may affect the quality of ginger.Peaks 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 with the highest content ascharacteristic peaks were signi ﬁcant for quality control of ginger ﬁngerprints.Meanwhile, similar characteristic peaks were obtained in the grinding samples.In Supplementary Table S1B , S23 and S24, S23, and S25, S23, and S27 correlated the grinding samples.
Therewere eight peaks with the highest content in S23, which might affect the quality of samples. In contrast, the correlation between S20 and S23, S20 and S24, S20 and S25, and S20 and S27 were lower thanother batches.Apparently, the contents of peak 4 in S20 weresigniﬁcantly higher than that of S23, 24, 25, and 27.Meanwhile,the content of peaks 5 and 7 of S20 was markedly higher than that of S23, S24, S25, and S27.As the control spectrum of grindingpretreatment samples shows ( Figure 1D ), peaks 4, 5, 7, and other characteristic peaks had crucial implications for quality control.Meanwhile, liquid nitrogen samples ( Supplementary Table S1C ) showed that S50 and S46, S50 and S48, S50, and S49, S50, and S51 had higher correlations.On the contrary, correlations between S35 and S42, S35, and S43, S35, and S44, S35, and S45 were lowerthan other batches.The content of peaks 2, 4, and 5 in S50 was lowerthan in other samples.
The contents of peaks 2, 5, and 7 in S35 werequite different from those in S42, S43, and S45. It was observed thatpeaks 2, 4, 5, and 7 could signi ﬁcantly affect the quality of gingers (Figure 1F ).The total content of the main component had an essential effect on the intrinsic quality of ginger through the analysis of similarity data.Meanwhile, some small elements also showed signi ﬁcant differences in different samples.It was noted that other originareas and processing methods in ﬂuenced the quality of ginger samples.3.3 Hierarchical cluster analysis The dendrogram plot de ﬁned three distinctive clusters.These results showed that HCA could effectively distinguish samples fromthe same origin with different extraction methods and classify theminto three quality clusters based on morphological characteristics.As shown in the scoring chart of ultramicro comminuted sample (Figure 2A ), it could be classi ﬁed into three separate groups.S6-S11 clustered into one category.
The S13, S14, S16, S17 from Yunnan province were close to each other, they were regarded as one group. The pro ﬁle of S12 and S15 were on the brink of S1-S5 samples.Therefore, S1-S5, S12, S15 were tended to be grouped intothe same cluster.These inspired that the samples from Shandongand Yunnan province had similarities in chemical composition.Figures 2B, C showed the data of liquid nitrogen and grinding samples divided into three clusters based on different origins.According to the origins, 17 batches of samples were divided into three clusters strictly.This indicates that they differ in the content and distribution of the main chemical components.In Figure 3B , these were the compounds that separated S29-S34 as group 1.Group2 was comprised of peak 18 –22 and the samples were all collected from Shandong province.When it comes to the other six samples,S23-S28 from Anhui province was clustered in group 3.
As shown inliquid nitrogen freezer mill pre-treated samples ( Figure 2C ), group 1 consisted of S35-S39 collected from Shandong province. Group 2 included samples S40-S45 collected from Anhui province.The extra six samples, S46-S51 from Anhui province, were clustered ingroup 3.3.4 Principal component analysis InFigure 3A , the samples could be visually classi ﬁed into three separate groups according to different origins.S1-S5 were prone to be classi ﬁed into one group.S6-S11 seemed to be grouped into the same cluster.What is more, S12-S17 were in the same group.Theproﬁle of S12 was closed to that of S1-S5 samples.To compare the Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org 05Wang et al.10.3389/fchem.2023.1296712 result which obtained from both techniques, the PCA and HCA showed comparable results.Most samples with the same origin wereaggregated into the same clusters.As shown in the PCA score plot(Figure 3B ), the samples could be visually classi ﬁed into three separate groups.
S18-S22 (Shandong province) were in the samedomain. S23-S28 (Anhui province) was also in the same domain.In comparison, the other six samples (S29-S34 from Yunnan province)were in the same domain.The dendrogram ( Figure 3C ) visibly showed that all samples were divided into three clusters.Fivesamples (S35-S39) from Anhui were classi ﬁed into the same FIGURE 2 Dendrogram of ginger samples with different extraction methods: (A)Super ﬁne crush pre-treated ginger.(B)Grinding pretreatment ginger.(C) Liquid nitrogen freeze mill pre-treated ginger.Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org 06Wang et al.10.3389/fchem.2023.1296712 group.Indeed, samples from Anhui province (S40-S45) were clustered into the same group.The rest of the samples (S46-S51)formed a group.The results were consistent with their native place.It shows that the ginger from Anhui and the other two origins (Shandong and Yunnan province) were divided into three maincategories.
The results of the principal component analysis were presented in the form of a score. The load focuses on multivariate changes thataffect the differences between samples.Therefore, common peakareas of various resolved components were analyzed, and a datamatrix of elements for samples was established ( Kong et al., 2009 ).The peak areas of 8 components in each sample were the ﬁrst and second PCs (PC1, PC2) for visually this new data matrix.The loadings plot of ginger with different extraction was illustrated ( Figure 3D –F).Analysis of the loading plot of PC1 against PC2 ( Figure 3D ) revealed that peaks contributing to PCA in ﬂuenced the cluster in top-down order.Peaks 3, 4, and 6 that mainly contributed to PC2 classi ﬁed S6-S11 as the same group.Insummary, since PC1 contributing fewer peaks than PC2, samples on the left side of Figure 3D were presumed higher quality.Accordingly, ginger collected from Anhui province had the highest quality.
The loadings scores indicated that the peaks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 might be the main in ﬂuencing factors for the discrimination of different samples. Analysis of ginger loading plots of PC1 against PC2 ( Figure 3E ) revealed that peaks explained by PC1, peaks 5, 7, and 8 in ﬂuenced the cluster in top-down order.Owing to the higher intensities ofpeaks 7, 8, 5, Yunnan samples were characterized primarily bypositive values of PC1.From the loading plot, peak 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 hadthe most substantial in ﬂuence on the quality of geographical differences and various processing techniques.From the loading plot of liquid nitrogen ( Figure 3F ), peaks 1, 3, 5, and 7 had an enormous impact on geographic difference quality.Besides, peak2 and peak 4 also affect quality evaluation.By determining the contents of those chemical marker compounds, the quality of gingers from various sources could bemeasured.
The consistent result was obtained from SA, PCA, and FIGURE 3 PCA score scatter plots and loading scatter plots for the samples. (A–C)The score scatter.Plots of ginger with different extraction methods from Shandong, Anhui, Yunnan, respectively.(D–F)The loadings plot of ginger with varying forms of extraction from Shandong, Anhui, Yunnan, respectively.Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org 07Wang et al.10.3389/fchem.2023.1296712 HCA, implying that PCA was an ef ﬁcient complement for HCA and SA.In consideration of our existing standard and the currently contained standards produced in the laboratory, 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol (peak 4, 5, 6 in super ﬁne samples; peak 4, 5, 7 in grinding and liquid nitrogen samples) were selected as thenatural substance to study the effect of producing area on the qualityof ginger.
Meanwhile, gingerols exhibited major medicinal activityas the main component of ginger.3.5 Method validations of quantitative analysis 3.5.1 Linearity As shown in Figures 4A, B , methanol was used to prepare the mixed standard of 3 main ingredients at each concentration level to establish the calibration curves, ensuring that the concentration of samples was within the linear range. Table 2 demonstrated that the established calibration curves had a favorable direct relationshipwithin the test ranges.The correlation coef ﬁcients were more excellent than 0.9990.Their structures are shown in Figure 4C .3.5.2 Precision, repeatability, and stability The standard sample precision was inspected six times of injection in succession.Six consecutive doses of the sample were performed for accurate inspection.
Reproducibility was evaluated bycomparing the peak areas of three independently prepared samples.The reproducibility assessed by comparing the peak area of threeindividually designed samples can be viewed in Supplementary Table S2 . The methodology validation that the relative standard deviation (RSD) for precision, repeatability.The stability coef ﬁcient was lower than 3.37.All these results showed that the HPLC method is accurate and valid.3.6 Contents analyses of the three primary active ingredients The relative peak area (RPA) and relative retention time (RRT) was represented as the reference peaks.The contents of three primary active ingredients of ginger in Supplementary Table S3 .I ti l l u s t r a t e dt h a tt h e content of gingerols was signi ﬁcantly varied in each sample, especially the samples from different sources.T he internal quality relationship should be evaluated to conquer the suitable origin and extractionmethod.
The content of the 6-gingerol was the most abundantcomponent. The sequence of the total contents of the threec o m p o u n d si nd i v e r s es a m p l e sw a s6 - g i n g e r o l >8-gingerol >10- gingerol.They were primary index ingredients as well as potentially active compounds in ginger.Conseque ntly, the quality control approach in Chinese Pharmacopoeia using only 6-gingerol for quanti ﬁcation was improper.It was suggested that othe r gingerols (8-gingerol and 10- g i n g e r o l )a l s os h o u l db eq u a n t i ﬁed.Hence, we used 6-gingerol as well as 8-gingerol and 10-gingerol as the quality marker in this paper.The samples collected from Anhui province had the highest total contents of three components.It indicated that the ginger from theAnhui province might have the most e xcellent exceptional quality.Moreover, the samples crushed by lo w-temperature liquid nitrogen, the content of gingerols, were signi ﬁcantly higher than other pre- processing crushing methods.
Li quid nitrogen processing might provide the usable method to get the hi ghest gingerols contents of ginger. 3.7 Discriminant analysis Based on Fisher ’s linear discriminant function coef ﬁcients, classi ﬁcation discriminant models of samples were established from three origins: Shandong, Anhui, and Yunnan provinces ( X1: 6-gingerol, X2:8-gingerol, X3:10-gingerol,): FIGURE 4 The chromatographic ﬁngerprint and chemical structure of gingerols.(A)The chromatographic ﬁngerprint of Zingiber of ﬁcinale Roce.(B)The HPLC chromatogram of gingerols composition.(1) 6- gingerol; (2) 8-gingerol; (3) 10-gingerol.(C)The chemical structure of gingerols.Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org 08Wang et al.
10.3389/fchem.2023.1296712 In super ﬁne samples: Shandong /equals0.193X1−0.256X2+0.639X3−59.935 (1 ) Anhui /equals0.184X1−0.176X2+0.770X3−78.441 (2 ) Yunnan /equals0.169X1−0.087X2+0.595X3−57.403 (3 ) In grinding samples: Shandong /equals−0.116X1+0.087X2+1.481X3−62.072 (4 ) Anhui /equals−0.700X1+1.815X2+2.829X3−207.383 (5 ) Yunnan /equals0.360X1−1.173X2+0.305X3−32.612 (6 ) In liquid nitrogen samples: Shandong /equals0.076X1+1.484X2+0.127X3−69.835 (7 ) Anhui /equals0.028X1+1.539X2+0.196X3−68.114 (8 ) Yunnan /equals0.187X1+1.125X2−0.053X3−71.096 (9 ) When discriminating against the samples type, the samples were plugged into the three classi ﬁcation functions, respectively. Then classify them into the class corresponding to the most considerablenumerical value as the substantial value.X represents the variable.Meanwhile, the regression estimate method was used fordiscriminant analysis.
The actual result was shown in Table 3 , 82.4%, 100%, and 88.2% of the original grouped cases were correctly classi ﬁed. It showed that this method was practical and feasible.The discriminant analysis could achieve the prediction andidenti ﬁcation of the origin of gingers.So as to, discriminant analysis had an absolute value for the promotion and application.4 Discussion Interestingly, a discriminant a nalysis of the region of origin of ginger found that the retention of active ingredients varied amongdifferent processing methods.In orde r to investigate potential factors, the ginger was ground using liquid n itrogen freezing, resulting in the smallest particle size.Additionally , the use of lower temperatures helped to preserve the stability of the phenolic components.
Simultaneously,the elevated temperature involved in the ultra- ﬁne grinding procedure, coupled with the excessive powder produced during the grinding and crushing stages, has the p otential to diminish the concentration of activeconstituents. The gingerols may conv ert into shogaols upon exposure to high temperatures during the drying or frying process.Consequently, the anti-oxidant and antimicrobial properties of gingerols are enhanced.In addition, it has been established t hat practical proc essing methods have a substantial in ﬂuence on the gingerol content.The results of the current study suggest that the utilization of liquid nitrogen freezing is asuperior process for achieving the highest recovery of gingerol fromginger ( Chen et al., 2019 ).The application of ultrasonic pressure waves and cavitation effectivel y disrupted the cells and cell walls, leading to the breakdown of the ginger material.
Furthermore, the utilization of ultrasound pretreatment has the a dded advantage of preserving the natural color of dried ginger slices. These techniques have been shownto be effective in enhancing the con centration of bioactive compounds such as gingerols oil, derivatives, and antioxidants, while alsoinactivating harmful enzymes like polyphenol oxidase andperoxidase ( Osae et al., 2019 ).The temperature was an essential factor to be considered for determining the optimal extractioncondition ( Hsieh et al., 2020 ) .T h es o u r c eo fg i n g e ri si d e n t i ﬁed, and the advantages and disadvantages of ginger quality are evaluated through this method.The liquid n itrogen freezing and crushing method and ultrasonic extraction method retain the unique ﬂavor of ginger to make a relevant diet.
The evaluation method for ginger willserve as a potential and valuable refe rence for evaluating the quality, extraction methods, and devel opment of food or other related traditional Chinese medicines. It is necessary to acknowledge thelimitations of this work, for example, the number of ginger samples is small and all compounds in ginger were not acknowledged through t h eH P L C .I no u rf u t u r ew o r k ,w ei n t e n dt oc o l l e c tm o r eg i n g e rs a m p l e sand identify more compounds of ginger by mass spectrometry.5 Conclusion In this work, a fast and straightforward HPLC ﬁngerprint of ginger was developed.The results of chemometric techniques such as SA, HCA, PCA, and DA were suitable for analyzing ﬁngerprint data, establishing quality control, and evaluating ginger.Characteristic ﬁngerprint peaks were identi ﬁed, and gingerol components could be used as markers and quantitativelydetermined.
Based on the analysis, the disparity of samplesfrom different origins was the dominant factor in qualitydifferences and geographical distance. The physicochemical properties of ginger are greatly in ﬂuenced by the processing, fermentation, and drying methods employed.In essence, Anhuiserves as the most suitable source of ginger, while the optimalprocessing technique involves the use of liquid nitrogen to freeze and crush the ginger.These ﬁndings provide valuable insights for the future utilization of ginger.For scholars conducting researchon food and drug quality control of traditional Chinese medicine,TABLE 2 Calibration curve of three primary active ingredients in ginger samples.
