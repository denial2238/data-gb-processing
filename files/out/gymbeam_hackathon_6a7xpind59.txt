Iron Supplementation Improves Skeletal Muscle Contractile Properties in Mice with CKD Brent A.Momb ,1Edwin Patino,2Oleh M.Akchurin,3,4and Mark S.Miller1 Key Points /C15CKD in mice decreased single skeletal muscle ﬁber force production independent of ﬁber size./C15Iron supplementation in CKD mice improved aspects of contractile function, indicating CKD myopathy was partially mediated by iron imbalance./C15Ourﬁndings in mice suggest that timely correction of iron imbalance and anemia may improve muscle ﬁber function in patients with CKD.Abstract Background Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently have compromised physical performance, which increases their mortality; however, their skeletal muscle dysfunction has not been characterized at the single- ﬁber and molecular levels.Notably, interventions to mitigate CKD myopathy are scarce.
Methods The effect of CKD in the absence and presence of iron supplementation on the contractile function of individual skeletal muscle ﬁbers from the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles was evaluated in 16-week-old mice. CKD was induced by the adenine diet, and iron supplementation was by weekly iron dextraninjections.Results Maximally activated and fatigued ﬁber force production was decreased 24% –52% in untreated CKD, independent of size, by reducing strongly bound myosin/actin cross-bridges and/or decreasing myo ﬁlament stiffness in myosin heavy chain (MHC) I, IIA, and IIB ﬁbers.Additionally, myosin/actin interactions in untreated CKD were slower for MHC I and IIA ﬁbers and unchanged or faster in MHC IIB ﬁbers.Iron supplementation improved anemia and did not change overall muscle mass in CKD mice.
Iron supplementation amelioratedCKD-induced myopathy by increasing strongly bound cross-bridges, leading to improved speci ﬁc tension, and/ or returning the rate of myosin/actin interactions toward or equivalent to control values in MHC IIA and IIB ﬁbers. Conclusions Skeletal muscle force production was signi ﬁcantly reduced in untreated CKD, independent of ﬁber size, indicating that compromised physical function in patients is not solely due to muscle mass loss.Ironsupplementation improved multiple aspects of CKD-induced myopathy, suggesting that timely correction of iron imbalance may aid in ameliorating contractile de ﬁcits in CKD patients.KIDNEY360 3: 843 –858, 2022.doi: https://doi.org/10.3 4067/KID.0004412021 Introduction The decline in physical function from CKD is well predicted by GFR (1).Disease progression compro- mises the ability to perform activities of daily living, and impaired physical function strongly predicts mortality in CKD patients (2).
Frailty from muscleatrophy in CKD is multifactorial from malnutrition, decreased physical activity, cell senescence, and mitochondrial dysfunction (3). Importantly, reduced skeletal muscle mass does not completely explain poor physical function because whole musclestrength, de ﬁned as force production per bodyweight, is lower in CKD patients (1).These ﬁndings suggest that the underlying molecular contractile mechanisms, such as myo ﬁlament properties and myosin/actin interactions, are likely altered in CKD.In support of this hypothesis, single- ﬁber force pro- duction per muscle size was reduced in an animal model of CKD; however, only one myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform, MHC IIX, was examined inthis study (4), and the other functionally important isoforms, MHC I, IIA, and IIB, may respond differ- ently to CKD.

CKD patientswith anemia have greater fatigue (6) and physical function impairment (7), whereas normalization of hemoglobin leads to improved function (8). Because suf ﬁcient iron and oxy- gen are essential in skeletal muscle for oxidative pathways, this may partially explain the additional decrements inphysical function at the whole-body level in CKD patients with anemia (5).Contractile function of skeletal muscle may be altered through iron de ﬁciency alone due to protein deg- radation through AMP-activated protein kinase (9).Thus, one of our objectives was to determine if correction of func- tional iron de ﬁciency and anemia in CKD would improve contractile function of skeletal muscle ﬁbers.Fiber contractile function is commonly examined under conditions that produce maximal activation and force pro-duction; however, other relevant in vivo environments, such as fatigue and reduced calcium (Ca 21) release, may be altered with CKD.
Fatigue, or the decrease in whole skele-tal muscle force or power production with repeated con- tractions, is exacerbated in CKD from greater accumulation of metabolic byproducts, speci ﬁcally phosphate (P i)a n d hydrogen (H1) ions (10). Elevated P iand H1reduce the force and power generation of skeletal muscle ﬁbers (11), in part from their large effect on the myosin-actin cross-bridge cycle (12).CKD may alter the sensitivity of skeletal muscle proteins to metabolic byproducts because reducing pH alone causes a larger decrease in single- ﬁber speci ﬁc tension in an animal model with CKD (4).However, no prior studies have addressed muscle fatigue in CKD by altering both P iand H1in single ﬁbers.Ca21plays an important role in regulating skeletal muscle contractile function by binding to the troponin-tropomyosin complex and allowing myosin-actin cross-bridge formation andforce generation.
Ca 21handling may be impaired in CKD, as indicated by higher resting [Ca21] levels in skeletal mus- cle (13). As alterations in Ca21responsivity may cause declines in whole muscle performance (14), understanding if/how skeletal muscle Ca21sensitivity is modi ﬁed by CKD is valuable.This study was designed to examine the cellular and molecular contractile function of single ﬁbers in an animal model of CKD and the effect of iron supplementation to counter the loss of skeletal muscle function.The effects of CKD and iron supplementation on single- ﬁber properties were examined using three ex vivo environments, maximal and submaximal Ca21activation and fatigue, as models for the physiologic conditions affecting muscle in vivo .Materials and Methods Mice At 8 weeks of age, male C56BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to three groups: control, CKD, and CKD with iron supplementation (CKDFE).CKD was induced with a 0.2%adenine diet for 8 weeks, as previously described (15).
Mice were housed in temperature-controlled (around 22 /C14C) stan- dard cages on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum . In addition to the adenine diet, CKDFE mice received intraperitoneal injections of irondextran at 0.5 g/kg once a week.The soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were collected at euthana- sia at 16 weeks of age.Blood was collected at euthanasia from the inferior vena cava.BUN was measured on an AU680 analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA).Hemoglobin was measured on a Procyte DX analyzer (IDEXX, West- brook, ME).Animal experiments were approved by theInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Weill Cor- nell Medicine and complied with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Experimental Solutions for Single-Fiber Experiments Our commonly used experimental preparation allows the bathing solutions to enter the skeletal muscle ﬁber, meaning the ion concentrations throughout the ﬁber are tightly controlled. Dissecting solution was 20 mM N,N- bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES),5 mM ethylene glycol-bis(2-amino-ethylether)-N,N,N 9,N9- tetra-acetic acid (EGTA), 5 mM MgATP, 1 mM free Mg 21, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.25 mM P iwith pH 7.0 and at pCa 8.0 (pCa 5–log10([Ca21])).Skinning solution was 170 mM potassium propionate, 10 mM imidazole,5m ME G T A ,2 .5m MM g C l 2, 2.5 mM Na 2H2ATP and Roche protease inhibitor with pH 7.0.Storage solution was identical to skinning solution but with 1 mM sodium azide.Relaxing solution was the same as dissecting solution but with 5 mM P i, 15 mM creatine phosphate, and 300 ml/ml creatine phosphokinase.Preactivating solution was the same was relaxing solution except at an EGTA concentra- tion of 0.5 mM.
Activating solution was the same wasrelaxing solution but at pCa 4.5. Relaxing and activating solutions were mixed to achieve different pCa concentra- tions.2,3-Butanedione monoxime (BDM) solution was thesame as relaxing with the addition of 40 mM BDM.Fatigu- ing solution was the same as activating solution except with reduced pH (6.2) and higher P i(30 mM).Rigor solu- tion was the same as activating but without creatine phos- phate, creatine phosphokinase, and ATP.All solutionswere adjusted to an ionic strength of 175 mEq using sodium methane sulfate.Muscle Tissue Processing Muscle tissue for mechanical measurements was placed into cold (4 /C14C) dissecting solution immediately upon har- vesting.Soleus and EDL muscles were tied to glass rods and placed in skinning solution, a low Ca21solution that begins the removal of the muscle ﬁbers ’external mem- brane, for 24 hours at 4/C14C and then stored in storage solution with glycerol (50% v/v) at –20/C14C.
The addition of glycerol creates an osmotic pressure gradient to permeabi- lize the muscle ﬁbers ’external membrane further and keeps the solution from freezing and damaging the ﬁbers. Mechanical measurements and sinusoidal analysis occurred within 3 weeks of the dissection.Muscle tissues for apoptosis evaluation were ﬁxed in 4% paraformalde- hyde, paraf ﬁn embedded, cut, and processed for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) deoxyuridine triphos- phate (dUTP) nick end labeling (TUNEL).Staining was performed by the histology core of the Laboratory of Com- parative Pathology at Weill Cornell Medicine.844 KIDNEY360 Preparation for Single-Fiber Measurements On the day of a muscle function experiment, a section of the stored whole muscle was excised to create a muscleﬁber bundle and placed in dissecting solution with 1% v/v Triton X-100 for 30 minutes at 4 /C14Ct or e m o v em o r eo ft h e sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum.
After initial skin- ning, the bundle was transferred to dissection solution andcut into sections around 1 mm long. Forceps were used toisolate single ﬁbers, which had aluminum T clips placed on both ends.Fibers were demembranated a second time for30 minutes at 4 /C14C (dissection solution with 1% v/v Triton X-100) to ensure no remnants of the sarcolemma were intact.Top and side ﬁber diameters were measured in dis- secting solution to estimate the height-to-width ratio andwere subsequently transferred to the experimental appara-tus containing relaxing solution at 15 /C14C.The ﬁber was mounted in relaxing solution to the experimental apparatus by sliding the holes in the T clips onto hooks attached to apiezo actuator linear motor (P-841.10; Physik Instrumente,Auburn, MA) and an Akers strain gauge (AE-801; Sensor-One, Sausalito, CA; Figure 1A).
Sarcomere length was setto 2.65 mm, and cross-sectional area (CSA) was determined by measuring ﬁber width on the apparatus ’sc o m p o u n d microscope, estimating the height based upon the height-to-width ratio measured via microscope before mounting,and presuming ﬁber CSA is elliptical. The ﬁber was slack- ened completely, and the force gauge was zeroed at 25 /C14C.Theﬁber was pulled back to its original length, allowed to equilibrate for 1 minute.Relaxed speci ﬁc tension was mea- sured, and then the ﬁber was transferred to the preactivat- ing solution for 30 seconds.
At this point, ( 1)ﬁbers were placed into activating (pCa 4.5) or fatiguing solution, withspeciﬁc tension measured at its plateau and sinusoidal analysis performed, or ( 2)ﬁbers were placed into activating (pCa 4.5) solution and speci ﬁc tension/pCa relationships were measured, or ( 3) dynamic stiffness experiments were performed in activating and rigor solutions and then ( 4) placed into BDM solution and passive stretching experi- ments performed. Experimental Apparatus A custom-built single- ﬁber skeletal muscle mechanics apparatus was used, as previously described (16).Brie ﬂy, an aluminum bath plate of 13 wells (around 100 mle a c h ) was made to hold experimental solutions and a single largechamber (around 450 ml) for mounting the ﬁber onto the force and linear motor hooks.
Once a ﬁber was mounted in solution, the bath plate was moved vertically, to move theﬁber out of a chamber, and slid horizontally within a trough, underneath the ﬁxed motor and force gauge, allow- ing the ﬁber to be moved (around 1 second) between cham- bers and different solutions. The bathing solutions were maintained at a constant temperature by circulating cooling solution through channels milled into the chamber walls.The bathing solution assembly was mounted to an invertedmicroscope (Zeiss Invertiscope) with a video camera(BFLY-U3 –23S6m-C; Point Gray Research, Inc., Richmond, Canada) and custom video analysis software (ImageJ) that enabled precise measurements of ﬁber dimensions and sar- comere length.Single-Fiber Mechanical Measurements Myosin-actin cross-bridge mechanics and kinetics and properties of the myo ﬁlaments were derived using sinusoi- dal analysis, as previously described (16), over frequenciesranging from 1 to 200 Hz at 25 /C14C.
Brie ﬂy, small-amplitude sinusoidal strain (normalized length or length per change in length) was applied to one end of the ﬁber while the sinusoidal stress output (normalized force, or force perCSA) was measured at the other end of the ﬁber (Figure 1A). The stress output ( s) can be divided into its elastic ( se) and viscous ( sv) components by determining the magni- tudes of the in-phase and out-of-phase components (0/C14and 90/C14with respect to strain), and the elastic ( Em)a n dv i s c o u s (Vm) modulus calculated by dividing maximal elastic (amplitude of se) or viscous (amplitude of sv) stress by strain ( «amp, 0.125% of muscle length unless otherwise noted; Figure 1B).The elastic and viscous moduli are the real and imaginary parts of the complex modulus, the ratioof the stress output to the strain.
Sinusoidal analysis resultscan be related to speci ﬁc steps in the cross-bridge cycle by ﬁtting the complex modulus with the following six parame- ter equation: Y vðÞ¼ Aiv=aðÞk–Biv=ð2pbþivÞþCiv=ð2pcþivÞ where v52pfin s21,A,B,a n d Care magnitudes expressed in N/mm2,2pband 2pcare characteristic rates expressed in s21,i5–11/2,a51s21,a n d kis a unitless exponent. This analysis yields three characteristic processes, A,Band C, which relate to various mechanical ( A,B,C,a n d k)a n d kinetic (2 pband 2pc) properties of the cross-bridge cycle (Figure 1C), as previously described (16).Nyquist plots, or viscous versus elastic modulus, show the stress response of theﬁber to strain over a range of frequencies, which can be ﬁt using the six-parameter equation above (Figure 1D).
The Ap r o c e s s( Aand k) has no enzymatic dependence and, under Ca21-activated conditions, re ﬂects the viscoelastic mechanical response of the structural elements of muscle ﬁber (the myo ﬁlament lattice stiffness and attached myosin heads in series). The parameter Aindicates the magnitude of the viscoelastic modulus, whereas krepresents the degree to which these viscoelastic magnitudes are purelyelastic ( k50) or purely viscous ( k51).As the physical mean- ing behind Aand kcan be dif ﬁcult to understand, the parameter Awas instead separated into its real ( A-elastic) and imaginary ( A-viscous) components using the following equation: Ai v=aðÞk¼A-elastic v=aðÞkþiA-viscous v=aðÞk where A-elastic 5Acos(kp/2) and A-viscous 5Asin(kp/2).TheBand Cprocess magnitudes ( Band C) are proportional to the number of strongly bound myosin-actin interactionsand/or the stiffness of the cross-bridges.
As the Band C process magnitudes produce qualitatively near-identical results, only the Bvalues are shown. The frequency portion of the Bprocess (2 pb) is interpreted as the rate of myosin transition from the weakly to strongly bound state, or the(apparent) rate of myosin force production.The frequency portion of the Cprocess (2 pc)r e p r e s e n t st h ec r o s s - b r i d g e detachment rate, or in other words, the inverse (2 pc)21is the mean myosin attachment time to actin, ton.KIDNEY360 3: 843 –858, May, 2022 Iron Supplementation and Skeletal Muscle in CKD, Momb et al.

Relaxed speci ﬁc tension was measured, and the ﬁber was transferred to preactivating solution for 30 seconds and moved to solutions with pro-gressively greater Ca 21levels (pCa 7, 6.5, 6.25, 6.1, 6, 5.9, 5.75, 5.5, 5, 4.5) with speci ﬁc tension measured at each pla- teau. Normalized speci ﬁc tension was calculated for individ- ualﬁbers by the following equation: x2specific tension at pCa 7 :0/C0/C1 =specific tension at pCa 4 :5/C0 2specific tension at pCa 7 :0/C1 where xis the tension at a given Ca21level.Normalized force recordings were ﬁt to the Hill equation: Ca2þ/C2/C3 h=ðCa2þ/C2/C3 50hþCa2þ/C2/C3 hÞ where [Ca21]505calcium concentration at half activation, pCa 5052log [Ca21]50,a n d h5Hill coef ﬁcient.Dynamic Stiffness Measurements As u b s e to f ﬁbers underwent maximal Ca21and rigor acti- vation.At the tension plateau for each activation condition,sinusoidal length perturbations (50 cycles of 0.13% ﬁber length at 360 Hz) were imposed to provide dynamic stiffness measurements.
The amplitude of dynamic stiffness at maxi-mal Ca 21activation is proportional to the number of myosin heads bound to actin under maximal activation, whereas theamplitude of dynamic stiffness in rigor is proportional to the total number of myosin heads available to bind to actin, or the total cross-bridge number, with the assumption that allmyosin heads bind to actin in rigor. Thus, the ratio of maxi-mal Ca 21activated to rigor stiffness provides an estimate of the fraction of myosin heads available that bind to actin.Passive Stretching Dynamic Stiffness Measurements As u b s e to f ﬁbers underwent stretching experiments under relaxed conditions with BDM, which places the myo- sin heads in a pre-power stroke, non force-producing stateto remove their contribution to speci ﬁct e n s i o na n d dynamic stiffness.Sarcomere length was set to 2.65 mm, and a single sinusoidal length perturbation (50 cycles of0.25% ﬁber length at 100 Hz) was applied to determine dynamic stiffness.
The ﬁber was then stretched to 2.8, 3, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 3.8, and 4 mm with sinusoidal length perturba- tions at each interval after a tension plateau was reached. MHC Isoform Composition After sinusoidal analysis measurements, single ﬁbers were placed in 30 ml loading buffer, heated for 2 minutes at 65/C14C, and stored at –80/C14C until determination of MHC iso- form composition by SDS-PAGE to identify ﬁber type, as described (16), with minor modi ﬁcations to achieve better separation between the four MHC isoforms expressed inmouse skeletal muscle.Speci ﬁcally, the resolving gel was comprised of 8% acrylamide/bis-30% glycerol (w/v), andgels were run at 70 V for 1 hour followed by 275 V for 26 hours.Statistical Analyses Data are expressed as the mean 6SEM, and the statistical tests used for each experiment are provided in Supplemental Table 1 .
As there are multiple observations of variables within the same mouse, a linear mixed model was used,including a random effect to account for clustering of obser-vations within mice. Pvalues #0.05 were considered sta- tistically signi ﬁcant.Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows v27.0 (IBM Corp.,Armonk, NY).Results CKD Characteristics CKD and CKDFE mice had similar reductions in body, muscle, and kidney mass compared with controls (Table 1).Iron supplementation improved anemia in CKDFE micecompared with untreated CKD (Table 1).Body weight wassimilar at 8 weeks of age (at the beginning of the experimen-tal period) for all groups but decreased 29% –33% over the duration of the adenine diet for CKDFE and CKD, whereas Table 1.

847 body mass was nonsigni ﬁcantly increased (10%) over this time period in control mice ( Supplemental Figure 1 ). Maximal Ca21-Activated Properties The effects of CKD and CKDFE on the cellular (force, CSA, and speci ﬁc tension) and molecular (myo ﬁlament properties and myosin/actin cross-bridge kinetics) contrac- tile properties of single ﬁbers were examined by MHC iso- form because MHC is the primary determinant of ﬁber functional characteristics (17).All MHC I and IIA ﬁbers were from the soleus, and all MHC IIB ﬁbers were from the EDL.Force, CSA, and Specific Tension Average speci ﬁc tension (force per CSA) was reduced by 36% –51% for CKD and CKDFE for MHC I, IIA, and IIB ﬁbers, although CKDFE ﬁbers had increased speci ﬁct e n - sion compared with CKD for MHC IIA and IIB ﬁbers (Fig- ure 2A).These results indicate iron supplementation improved force production in fast-contracting (MHC IIA and IIB) but not slow-contracting (MHC I) ﬁber types.
Spe- ciﬁc tension ﬁndings were consistent across ﬁber types, but changes in force and CSA were ﬁber-type dependent (Figure 2, B –C). MHC I ﬁbers in CKD and CKDFE had sim- ilar force production to controls but were hypertrophied.MHC IIA CKD and CKDFE ﬁbers had reduced force pro- duction, but hypertrophy that occurred with CKD was not present in CKDFE.MHC IIB ﬁbers in CKD and CKDFE were atrophied, but force production was reduced less in CKDFE than CKD.For each ﬁber type, the relationship between single- ﬁber force production and size was further examined by plotting the force versus CSA for individual ﬁbers and performing a linear regression for each group (Figure 2, D –F).In general, CKD and CKDFE force/CSA relationships showed lower slopes and intercepts for MHC I, IIA, and IIB ﬁbers.The only exceptions were in MHC I ﬁbers where CKD had a similar slope and CKDFE had a higher intercept compared with control.
These plots indi- cate that for a given size, force production is reduced for CKD and CKDFE. Myofilament Properties and Myosin-Actin Cross- Bridge Kinetics Representative sinusoidal analysis data and six parame- ter equation curve ﬁts, which are used to determine myo ﬁl- ament properties and myosin-actin cross-bridge kinetics, are shown in Figure 1D.The number of strongly bound cross-bridges and/or the cross-bridge stiffness ( Bparame- ter) was lower in CKD and CKDFE for MHC I, IIA, and IIB ﬁbers, although CKDFE ﬁbers had increased values com- pared with CKD for MHC IIA and IIB ﬁbers (Figure 3A).We interpret the large reduction in speci ﬁc tension and B to be from a reduction in the number of strongly bound cross-bridges because recent modeling results indicate thatcross-bridge stiffness only modestly alters isometric force production (18).These results indicate that iron supple- mentation increased strongly bound cross-bridges in fast- contracting ﬁber types compared with CKD.
The A-elastic and A-viscous parameters re ﬂect the elastic and viscous properties of the myo ﬁlament lattice structure and the attached myosin heads in series. A-elastic and A-viscouswere unchanged in MHC I ﬁbers but decreased in CKD and CKDFE MHC IIA and IIB ﬁbers, with an improvement inA-viscous with iron supplementation compared with CKD in MHC IIB ﬁbers (Figure 3, B and C).The myosin rate of force production, or 2 pb, in CKD and CKDFE was slowed in MHC I and IIA ﬁbers but unchanged in MHC IIBﬁbers (Figure 3D).Myosin attachment time, or ton,i n CKD and CKDFE was unchanged in MHC I and MHC IIBbut longer in MHC IIA (Figure 3E).Overall, if cross-bridge kinetics (2 pborton) changed with CKD and CKDFE, they were slower in MHC I and IIA and unchanged in MHC IIBﬁbers.Notably, CKDFE MHC IIA ﬁbers had faster cross- bridge kinetics than CKD, showing iron supplementation partially ameliorated the effects of CKD.
As such, contrac-tile velocities of single ﬁbers could be increased in response to iron supplementation because as t onis inversely propor- tional to velocity (19). Relationship to Hemoglobin Levels Iron supplementation increased hemoglobin and speci ﬁc tension and the number of myosin heads strongly bound to a c t i ni nM H CI I Aa n dI I B ﬁbers and cross-bridge kinetics in MHC IIA ﬁbers under maximal Ca21-activating conditions compared with untreated CKD mice.To understand the relationship better between hemoglobin and contractile func- tion, we examined the association between cellular/molecu-lar parameters and hemoglobin.Increased speci ﬁct e n s i o n and Bin MHC IIA and IIB ﬁbers and faster cross-bridge kinetics in MHC IIA ﬁbers were correlated with hemoglobin (Figure 4, A and F).
These ﬁndings indicate improvements in hemoglobin are associated with increased force produc- tion, likely due to an increased number of strongly boundmyosin and potentially faster contractile velocities, as a con- sequence of faster cross-bridge kinetics (19,20). Passive and Rigor Properties Speci ﬁc tension and dynamic stiffness were examined at various sarcomere lengths in relaxing solution containingBDM, placing the myosin heads in a prepower stroke, nonforce-producing state (21), producing measures of the myoﬁlament lattice properties.As expected, speci ﬁct e n - sion and stiffness rose with increasing sarcomere length in all three ﬁber types (Figure 5).Speci ﬁct e n s i o na n d dynamic stiffness in CKD ﬁbers remained similar to control in MHC I ﬁbers but decreased 32% –60% in MHC IIA and 42% –68% in IIB ﬁbers, showing that CKD greatly reduced the myo ﬁlament lattice stiffness in fast-contracting ﬁbers.
Hence, the large decreases in Aelastic and Aviscous with CKD are due, in large part, to reduced myo ﬁlament lattice stiffness. The ratio of maximal Ca 21-activated stiffness to rigor stiffness was increased with CKD in MHC I and IIA ﬁbers (Figure 6A), indicating that a greater percentage of the total number of myosin heads available were strongly bound under maximal activation.However, rigor and maximumCa 21-activated stiffnesses were reduced with CKD in MHC I, IIA, and IIB ﬁbers (Figure 6, B and C).In MHC I ﬁbers that had similar myo ﬁlament stiffness between groups (Figure 5D), these reductions indicate the total number of available myosin heads that can bind actin were reduced, leading to reduced strongly bound heads under maximum848 KIDNEY360 Ca21activation.
In MHC IIA and IIB ﬁbers, the decreased values may be explained by the reduced myo ﬁlament stiff- ness between CKD and control (Figure 5, E and F) or areduction in available myosin heads.Fatigued Properties In vivo , elevated intracellular P iand H1are the hallmarks of muscle fatigue (22).

TUNEL Labeling To identify if apoptosis could be a mechanism behind the decreased muscle mass in CKD and CKDFE (Table 1), we performed TUNEL labeling of skeletal muscle sections,which was negative ( Supplemental Figure 3 ). Thus, apopto- sis of myocytes was likely not a major contributor to mus-cle loss in this model of CKD.Discussion This study is the ﬁrst to assess comprehensively cellular and molecular mechanisms of CKD-induced contractile myopathy.

Myo- sin-actin interactions (cross-bridge kinetics) with CKD wereslower for MHC I and IIA ﬁbers but unchanged or faster in MHC IIB ﬁbers under maximal activation and fatiguing conditions. Ca 21sensitivity was only slightly reduced in MHC IIB ﬁbers in CKD mice.Iron supplementation amelio- rated myopathy associated with CKD, indicating that disrupted iron homeostasis and anemia in CKD likely con-tribute to muscle dysfunction.Because molecular level interactions within individual muscle ﬁbers dictate cellular (26) to whole muscle to whole body performance (27), our results provide novel insightsinto the underlying mechanisms of compromised physical function in CKD (2).Previous studies have reported reduced whole muscle isometric torque production in CKDpatients (1,10) and an animal model (28).Our work builds upon these ﬁndings by identifying molecular mechanisms behind reduced force production in single skeletal muscleﬁbers.
Frailty is prevalent in CKD patients and can present as slowed gait speed (1,3,29), which is a determinant of poor physical function (30) and mortality (2). Slower cross-bridge kinetics are responsible for decreased single- ﬁber contractile velocity (19) and thus may be implicated in slower gait speeds in patients.Slower cross-bridge kinetics could also lead to the longer muscle relaxation ratesdescribed in dialysis patients (31).The differential ﬁndings from various MHC isoforms may be due to muscle-speci ﬁc loading or function because MHC I and IIA ﬁbers were present in soleus and MHC IIB ﬁbers in EDL in mice.In humans, the soleus and EDL muscles are utilized for plan-tarﬂexion (32) and dorsi ﬂexion (33), which are critically important for ambulation (34).Notably, in our experiments, CKD produced striking alterations in the performance ofMHC I and IIA ﬁbers, which are most commonly expressed in humans.
Overall, our results suggest that decreased myoﬁlament stiffness, reduced myosin-actin cross-bridges, and slowed cross-bridge kinetics should be examined inpatients with CKD because they likely have a major role in the loss of physical function. Iron supplementation alleviated anemia in CKD mice.As nonrenal anemia is associated with muscle weakness in older adults (35), anemia in CKD may exacerbate the disease-associated myopathy; however, direct evidence islacking.Anemia is common in CKD patients and results in greater fatigue (6) and physical impairment (7), possibly due to decreases in skeletal muscle performance.In ourstudy, CKD-induced anemia was partially reversed usingiron supplementation and reduced contractile de ﬁcits in MHC IIA and IIB ﬁbers, suggesting that iron may bene ﬁt fast-contracting ﬁbers in CKD patients.

Higher tissue oxygenation through increased hemoglobin and/or myoglobin enhances ske- letal muscle protein synthesis (39) and nitric oxide produc-tion (40), potentially increasing contractile velocity (41).Although iron supplementation generally improved con- tractile performance, Ca 21sensitivity was reduced. How- ever, this may not be relevant to patients with CKD because resting skeletal muscle [Ca21] is typically elevated in CKD (13).Improvements in contractile function from iron supplementation could also be due to enhanced physi-cal activity due to mitigation of the anemia-related physical impairments.As physical activity can improve physical function and reduce fatigue (42), future work should incor-porate assessment of physical activity in studies of muscle function in CKD.
The magnitude of effects that iron supplementation exerted on many parameters of single- ﬁber performance are comparable or exceeding those reported for effective interventions targeting muscle function in patients withCKD. Indeed, CKD patients undergoing progressive resis- tance training were able to achieve an increase in knee extensor strength of 13% –25% (43 –46).These improve- ments in strength were associated with improved quality of life and physical function.Thus, these studies indicate improvements of 13% –25% in knee extensor strength improve physical function in CKD patients.
Assuming that an increase in single- ﬁber force production per muscle size (speci ﬁc tension) would translate to a similar improvement in force production at the whole muscle level, our ﬁndings that iron supplementation improves speci ﬁc tension by 21% –26% in MHC IIA and IIB ﬁbers (Figure 2A) compared with CKD suggest that iron supplementation could provide a clinically relevant improvement in CKD patients. Another recent clinical study found that improvements in wholemuscle power output of 9% –10% were clinically meaning- ful in mobility-limited older adults (47).Power output, which is the product of force and velocity, is a key predic-tor of the age-related decrease in functional capacity.MHC IIAﬁbers showed a 18% decrease in myosin attachment time ( t on) with iron supplementation compared with CKD, which should increase single- ﬁber contractile velocity and power output.
Overall, our results fall into the range ofpotentially being clinically meaningful in terms of improv- ing whole muscle functional performance. Muscle force production was previously shown to be reduced in response to low pH, which is a key metabolic byproduct of fatigue, in an animal model of CKD in MHC IIXﬁbers (4).However, when simulating fatigue by decreasing pH and increasing P iin the bathing solutions surrounding and within the ﬁber, our ﬁndings show that the relative decrease in force with fatigue was less for CKDthan control for MHC I and was similar for both groups in MHC IIA and IIB ﬁbers.These results indicate that the force-producing mechanisms in MHC I ﬁbers may become resistant to the metabolic byproducts of P iand pH, possibly indicating a protective response of muscle ﬁbers to CKD.
Additionally, the different patterns in the response of thecross-bridge kinetics to fatigue with CKD that we observed, most notable in MHC I and IIB ﬁbers, may account for alterations in contractile velocity. Examining our results in the context of the sarcomeric determinants of force generation provides insights into the potential mechanisms responsible for the loss of speci-ﬁc tension in CKD.Under Ca 21-activated conditions, single- ﬁber isometric force production is due to the number of strongly bound myosin-actin cross-bridges, the forceRigor Stiffness (N/mm2) 0 I IIA IIB10203040 Max Ca2+ Stiffness (N/mm2) 0 I IIA IIB102030 100Max Ca2+ / Rigor Stiffness Ratio (%)80 604020 0 I IIA IIB Control CKDA B C Figure 6.|Single skeletal muscle ﬁber maximal Ca21-activated to rigor dynamic stiffness ratio and maximal Ca21-activated and rigor dynamic stiffness for control and CKD groups by ﬁber type.

Lower force trans-mission, due to decreased stiffness of the myo ﬁlaments (i.e., thin [primarily actin], thick [primarily myosin], and titin) and other sarcomeric structures that anchor the ﬁla- ments ( i.e., Z bands and M lines) and link myo ﬁbrils ( i.e., costameres), reduces the active force generated by the sar- comere (48). Under passive conditions, single- ﬁber isomet- ric force production is due to stiffness of the elementsproviding force transmission, except for the thin ﬁlament, because the strongly bound cross-bridges have been removed.In the present study, active speci ﬁc tension with CKD was reduced in all ﬁber types examined (Figure 2A), whereas passive speci ﬁc tension was reduced only in MHC IIA and IIB ﬁbers (Figure 5, A –C).These results indicate that sarcomeric protein alterations were ﬁber-type speci ﬁc, possibly due to their commonly expressing different iso- forms of the myo ﬁlament, Z band and M line proteins (49).
Titin is a primary determinant of passive force and altersactive properties (50), making this giant protein a strong candidate for the observed changes in MHC IIA and IIBﬁbers. Titin alters its stiffness through various means, including Ca 21binding, phosphorylation, and oxidation, and can alter myo ﬁlament lattice spacing, which affects myosin ’s ability to bind actin (50).The loss of myo ﬁlaments and Z band streaming observed in hemodialysis patients (51,52) should decrease the number of strongly bound cross-bridges and/or force transmission.Shorter thick ﬁla- ment length due to remodeling could also reduce active force generation because fewer myosin heads would be available to strongly bind to actin.Myosin and/or actinloss, titin modi ﬁcations, and/or thick ﬁlament shortening have been observed in disuse and disease (53,54,55); however, direct data on these potential mechanisms inprehemodialysis CKD patients are lacking.
CKD may addi-tionally cause post-translational modi ﬁcations of sarco- meric proteins, leading to altered properties. Thus, there are several plausible putative mechanisms which likely 200 ****** *** ****** ** 150 100 50 0 I IIASpecific Tension (mN/mm2) A-viscous (N/mm2) IIB I IIA IIB0.00.51.01.52.0CKDFE CKD Control AD ** ** ** * *** 0 0050100150200 1000 800 600400200 0 I IIA IIB I IIA IIB 2πb (s–1)B (N/mm2) 20406080 1020304050BE ************ 0 0 0 0246 I IIA IIB I IIA IIBton (ms)A-elastic (N/mm2) 10203040 5101520 123CF Figure 7.|Speci ﬁc tension and sinusoidal analysis model parameters for fatigued ﬁbers for control, CKD, and CKDFE groups by ﬁber type.Fatigued conditions were modeled at pH 6.2, P i530 mM, pCa 54.5.Mean 6SEM with individual data points overlaid on top of bars.(A) Speci ﬁc tension.(B) Parameter Bis proportional to the number of myosin heads strongly bound to actin and cross-bridge stiffness.

Our ﬁndings high- light an unmet need for future studies to examine thesemechanisms, which will aid in the development of CKD- speciﬁc therapeutic approaches.Fiber CSA in CKD increased (17% –73%) in MHC I and IIAﬁbers from the soleus and decreased (21%) in MHC IIB ﬁbers from the EDL, despite signi ﬁcant weight loss (44% –54%) in both muscles.Therefore, MHC IIB ﬁber atrophy may explain loss of EDL weight.However, themechanism of soleus weight loss appears different because individual MHC I and IIA ﬁber size in CKD mice was either similar or larger than control mice (Figure 2C).Theseresults indicate that ﬁber loss and hypertrophy of the remaining ﬁbers are occurring with CKD in the soleus.
This differential muscle response to CKD may be explained bythe higher activation of the soleus during resting, standing, and walking than the EDL (56). Another proposed mecha- nism of ﬁber enlargement in CKD is edema (51); however, mice treated with adenine do not develop generalized edema (15).Our study highlights that ﬁber loss, which has not been directly examined in CKD animal models orpatients to our knowledge, may have important transla-tional and potentially therapeutic implications.

Even in the very few studies using control groups, results include larger (51), unchanged (30), or smaller (58) MHC I and II ﬁbers from patients, although the largest study performed to date ( n560 versus others with 10–12 patients) reported larger ﬁbers (26% –33%) (51), con- sistent with our ﬁndings. One important confounder that may explain the heterogeneity in ﬁber size in CKD is physi- cal activity, which is highly variable in patients with CKD (59) and should be assessed in future studies.In conclusion, in this CKD model, CKD-induced myopa- thy was encompassed by the loss of myo ﬁlament stiffness, reduced myosin/actin cross-bridges, and slowed cross- bridge kinetics.These uremia-driven alterations are likely compounded by iron imbalance and anemia.Correction of functional iron de ﬁciency and anemia improved skeletal muscle function in our model of CKD, which has direct translational potential for improving physical function in patients with CKD.
Translation of these ﬁndings to human studies is warranted with testing of additional interven-tions, such as resistance exercise, to increase force produc- tion and restore cross-bridge kinetics of muscle ﬁbers to improve physical function in patients with CKD.
