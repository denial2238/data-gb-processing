SHORT REPORT Low vitamin B-12 status in confirmed Alzheimer’s disease as revealed by serum holotranscobalamin H Refsum , A D Smith .............................................................................................................................J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2003; 74:959–961 Objective: To examine the possible association of holotranscobalamin, the active fraction of serum cobala- min, with Alzheimer’s disease.Methods: 51 patients with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer’s disease and 65 cognitively screened elderly controls were studied.Serum holotranscobalamin wasmeasured by a new solid phase radioimmunoassay.
Results: Geometric mean levels showed no significant case–control differences for serum total cobalamin, but lower levels of holotranscobalamin in Alzheimer’s disease(41.1 pmol/l) than in controls (57.1 pmol/l) (p < 0.001).The odds ratio of Alzheimer’s disease was significant forlow holotranscobalamin but not for low total cobalamin.Conclusions: Disturbed cobalamin status is common in Alzheimer’s disease and accordingly measurement of holo- transcobalamin should be considered in the assessment ofcognitively impaired patients. Ten to ﬁfteen per cent of elderly people have an undiagnosed vitamin B-12 (cobalamin) deﬁciency.1Hae- matological signs and symptoms are, however, often not present.This deﬁciency is usually explained by cobalaminmalabsorption in pernicious anaemia, or a failure to absorbprotein bound cobalamin.
1Several studies have shown that low cobalamin status or a raised total homocysteine—a com-mon ﬁnding in cobalamin deﬁciency—is associated with anincreased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. 2Earlier we showed that low normal cobalamin and raised total homocysteine were risk factors for pathologically conﬁrmed Alzheimer’s disease,and that a raised total homocysteine was associated with amore rapid disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease.3A recent large prospective study has shown an association ofraised total homocysteine with incident Alzheimer’s disease.4 Low cobalamin levels are one of the determinants of raisedtotal homocysteine.A problem with conventional serumcobalamin measurement is that it lacks speciﬁcity and sensi-tivity.About 80% of total cobalamin in serum is bound to hap-tocorrin and is not available to the cells.The metabolically active fraction of plasma cobalamins resides in holotransco-balamin (holoTC).
A decreased concentration of holoTC maythus be the earliest and the most sensitive marker of tissuecobalamin deﬁciency. 5Here we report our ﬁndings on holoTC and total cobalamin levels in conﬁrmed Alzheimer’s disease.METHODS The study population has been described previously.3From this cohort, we selected 51 cases of histopathologically conﬁrmed Alzheimer’s disease and 65 cognitively screened controls where serum (non-fasting) was still available.Serum holoTC was directly determined, blind to diagnoses, by Dr LÖrning (Axis-Shield Ltd, Oslo), using a novel solid phaseradioimmunoassay.6Serum total homocysteine was deter- mined by high performance liquid chromatography7andmethylmalonic acid was measured by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry.8 Data analysis All results are expressed as mean with 95% conﬁdence inter-vals (CI), after adjustment for age and sex.Skewed variables were log transformed before analyses.
Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and sex, was used to estimate theodds ratios of Alzheimer’s disease. Low vitamin levels or hightotal homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels were deﬁned as those below about the 20th centile or above about the 80th centile, respectively, in the controls.Linear regressionanalyses, adjusted for age and sex, were used to examine therelation between the vitamin variables (log transformed) andAlzheimer’s disease in the total group, and cognitive testscores in the control population.RESULTS Patient characteristics are shown in table 1.The patient group was about ﬁve years older than the control group, and theproportion of women was slightly lower.To control for these differences, we always adjusted for age and sex.The cognitive test scores and prevalence of ApoE e4 were, as expected, much lower and much higher, respectively, in the patients than inthe controls.
Geometric mean levels showed no signiﬁcant case–control differences for serum total cobalamin, but signiﬁcant differences were observed for holoTC, total homo-cysteine, and folate, and less so for methylmalonic acid (table1). Table 2 shows the risk associations of the vitamin related variables with conﬁrmed Alzheimer’s disease.While low totalcobalamin was not signiﬁcantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease, low holoTC and high methylmalonic acid were associ-ated.Low folate and raised total homocysteine concentrationswere also signiﬁcantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease.Including ApoE e4, smoking status, and creatinine in the model did not change the overall results (table 2).In a condi-tional logistic regression model including age, sex, and all ﬁvevitamin related variables, only raised total homocysteine andlow folate remained signiﬁcantly associated with Alzheimer’sdisease (data not shown).
Splitting the dataset in two according to the median total homocysteine level showed that low holoTC was associatedwith Alzheimer’s disease at high total homocysteine concen-trations (odds ratio = 9.45 (95% CI, 2.31 to 38.7)), but not atall at low total homocysteine concentrations (odds ra-tio = 0.91 (0.15 to 5.31)). In contrast, holoTC was not signiﬁ-cantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease at either high orlow folate concentrations.Spearman correlations and linearregression analyses (adjusted for age, sex, and apoE)conﬁrmed that holoTC was associated with Alzheimer’sdisease only at high total homocysteine concentrations (datanot shown).Low folate levels also showed a much strongerassociation at high total homocysteine concentrations (datanot shown).959 www.jnnp.com In the control population, we examined the association between the vitamin related variables and the cognitive scores.
After adjusting for age and sex, the CAMCOG (cognitive test from the Cambridge examination for mental disorders in the elderly) score was signiﬁcantly associated with serum levels ofboth cobalamin and holoTC ( r= 0.25, p = 0.04 for both vari- ables), whereas the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was signiﬁcantly related to holoTC ( r= 0.29, p = 0.021) but not to cobalamin ( r= 0.24, p = 0.059). Plasma concentrations of total homocysteine, folate, and methylmalonic acid were not signiﬁcantly associated with CAMCOG or MMSE scores.DISCUSSION Previous reports on cobalamin in relation to Alzheimer’s disease have shown inconsistent results.9–13Some studies have indeed been negative.14However, these studies have all been based on total cobalamin measurement, usually in small studypopulations.Our data may explain the inconsistencies.We found that the holoTC level was more strongly associated than total cobalamin with Alzheimer’s disease and with cognitivefunction scores in controls.
The ﬁnding that the association ofholoTC with Alzheimer’s disease was only present in subjects with high total homocysteine implies that its association may be caused by the effect of low tissue cobalamin on the level oftotal homocysteine, or by an interaction between homo-cysteine and cobalamin. 15Hence our data are consistent with the hypothesis that a raised total homocysteine level is associ- ated with Alzheimer’s disease.2In relation to the association we have found between low holoTC levels and Alzheimer’sdisease, it will be of interest to see if polymorphisms in the holoTC gene that inﬂuence holoTC or total homocysteine lev-els are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’sdisease.16 17 Whether low cobalamin status is a cause or a consequence of Alzheimer’s disease cannot be determined from our results.However, it is noteworthy that there was an association between holoTC levels and cognitive test scores in the control group.
A similar ﬁnding in elderly people has already beenreported. 18We suggest that future studies on the potential role of total homocysteine and cobalamin status in relation to Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline should include holo- TC measurement in addition to conventional total cobalamin determinations.In patients with cognitive impairment,plasma total homocysteine and holoTC are probably bettermarkers of cobalamin function than total cobalamin measure- ment.Our ﬁndings have direct clinical relevance as they provide evidence that subjects with Alzheimer’s disease often have impaired cobalamin status, something that can readily be cor-rected by treatment with vitamin B-12.
