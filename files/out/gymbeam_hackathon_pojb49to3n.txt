hum) and showed that male Aromhummice produced high levels of estrogen in the lower abdominal muscle (LAM) tissue, leading to ex-tensive LAM ﬁbrosis, muscle atrophy, and hernia forma- tion.Single-cell analysis of ﬁbrotic LAM tissue in these mice showed high expression of estrogen receptor alpha(ERα) in LAM ﬁbroblasts as well as upregulation of Wnt sig- naling pathways in these ER α-positive ﬁbroblasts.The ca- nonical Wnt/ β-catenin signaling pathway has been implicated in ﬁbroblast activation and ﬁbrosis in multiple organs, including the lung, heart, and skin.Thus, we hy-pothesized that canonical Wnt/ β-catenin signaling acts as a downstream mediator of ER αto cause LAM ﬁbroblast ac- tivation, tissue ﬁbrosis, and hernia.To test our hypothesis, we cultured primary ER α-positive LAM ﬁbroblasts from Arom hummice in the presence of estrogen with or without siRNA knockdown (KD) of β-catenin.
However, KD of β-catenin under these conditions did not alter ﬁbroblast proliferation as measured by EdU assay, nor did it alter ex- pression of genes involved in ﬁbroblast activation or extra- cellular matrix formation. Furthermore, administration ofLGK974, a Wnt signaling inhibitor, in male Arom hum mice did not prevent hernia development, decrease hernia size, or decrease the extent of LAM ﬁbrosis and muscle at- rophy.Thus, we concluded that the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway does not serve as adownstream mediator of estrogen-induced skeletal muscle ﬁbrosis in our Arom hummouse model of inguinal hernia.Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of Wnt/ β-catenin signaling in other inguinal hernia models or in humans.

Niedzialkowska: None.D.Shelden: None.Introduction: Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) are used in bodybuilders to increase muscle mass.Abuse has surged as they are regarded as potent image enhancementdrugs.There are a variety of illegal AAS available.Theirtrue content is often unknown and dosing regimens fre-quently include concurrent use of multiple hormonally ac-tive agents.Use among female body builders is rarelyreported.Having signi ﬁcantly lower levels of natural tes- tosterone, females may be more susceptible to side effectsand toxicity associated with AAS abuse.
Clinical case: 36year old cis-gender female presented to the Endocrinologyclinic for evaluation of fatigue. The patient worked as a per-sonal trainer at a gym and began participating in body-building competitions.A year prior to the visit the patientwas started on a steroid regimen by a friend at the gym.The patient ’s regimen included testosterone cypionate (250mg-350mg a week) and trenbolone acetate.Anastozole was added to limit conversion to estrogen butwas not administered on a regular basis.The patient re-ported no gender dysphoria.She has not had a menstrualperiod since she started the AAS.The patient was also diag-nosed with acute kidney injury at the time of AAS initiationand further work up showed negative ANA, C3, C4, normalUA and protein/creatinine ratio.Her kidney injury wasdeemed to be related to NSAID and testosterone use.
Atthe time of the visit laboratory results were signi ﬁcant for testosterone of >1500 ng/dl (N 240-1080), IGF-1 359 ng/ ml (N 63-223), LH <0.1 mUI/ml (N >0.6), FSH <0.5 mUI/ ml (N >1.4), estradiol 47 pg/ml (N 21-251), prolactin 10.8 ng/ml (N 3-30), hemoglobin 17.4 g/dl (N 12-15.1), platelets416 bil/L (150-400), TSH 0.75 uIU/ml (N 0.4-4.5), creatinine1.33 mg/dl (N 0.5-1.1), eGFR 53 ml/min/1.73m2. The pa-tient ’s testosterone regimen was gradually decreased to 100 mg weekly with plans to further decrease the dose and with close follow up and monitoring of gonadotropins.Treatment to stimulate endogenous estrogen productionmay be necessary despite her current value being withinnormal limits as this may be a function of peripheral con-version of exogenous testosterone.Conclusion: AAS abuse is infrequent among cis-gender females.

Exogenous administration of synthetic tes- tosterone results in negative feedback on the hypothalamic- pituitary axis, inhibiting GnRH, leading to inhibition of FSH and LH production leading to amenorrhea in females.AAS has also been associated with kidney injury with re-ports from animal studies suggesting testosterone inducedpodocyte damage and apoptosis.The steroid regimens usedby bodybuilders differ and include multiple hormonally ac-tive agents.Its abuse among cis-gender women is uncom-mon and further research is needed to evaluate itstoxicity among this group.Presentation Date: Thursday, June 15, 2023 25O4H34.No other formula is consistent with m/z=381 Da.G-trop: G-trop wasn ’t present in serum from children.
