The control group received their standard hospital treatment only. In addition to standard medications, the interven- tion group received 3000 mg oral L-carnitine daily in three divided doses for five days.The blood samples were collected and para-clinical parameters were measured at the beginning and end of the treatment.Clinical outcomes were also recorded, and data were analyzed using χ2 and t-tests.Results Higher means of O2 saturation were observed in the intervention rather than in the control group.Mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly lower in the intervention group.Furthermore, mean alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were lower in the intervention group.Also, lower mean serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was observed in the intervention group.
No significant differences were observed in terms of clinical symptoms; however, six patients (14%) in the control group died due to the complications of COVID-19, while all patients in the intervention group survived. Conclusion Taken together, L-carnitine can be considered as a drug supplement in patients with COVID-19.Keywords COVID-19 · L-carnitine · C-reactive protein · Para-clinical examination · Clinical outcome Introduction COVID-19 was identified as a worldwide concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) after an outbreak in Wuhan, China [1].This disease led to higher levels of infec- tion in crowded areas [2 ].It has also affected economics, especially in developed countries.The scientists were con- fronted with a severe lack of data about this disease and try - ing to gather more knowledge on its control, prevention and treatment.This shortcoming prompted researchers to gather a large amount of data about the disease.
In addition, high levels of morbidity and mortality [3 ] had harmful conse- quences on human life [4 ], presented healthcare profession- als with pressing challenges, and exposed the weaknesses of national health systems worldwide.
Coronavirus is an enveloped single-stranded-RNA pos- itive-sense virus that includes four subgroups called alpha, beta, delta, and gamma, of which beta type is responsible for The Post ‑COVID Era ‑ Advances and Challenges in Pharmacology * Rasool Haddadi haddadi.rasool@gmail.com; haddadi.r@umsha.ac.ir 1 Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti Medical Educational Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran 2 Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Herbal Medicine and Natural Product Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services, Hamadan, Iran 3 Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Services, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran 4 Department of Epidemiology, School of Health, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran 1297 Effects of L‑carnitine supplementation in patients with mild‑to‑moderate COVID‑19 disease:… 1 3 COVID-19.
This virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme- related carboxypeptidase (ACE2) receptors to enter cells is finding in the cardiopulmonary tissue, lymphocytes, mac- rophages, etc. [5 ].Clinical features range from asymptomatic to acute res- piratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dys- function.Common clinical features include fever, persistent cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia and short- ness of breath, which in most cases resolve spontaneously.However, in some cases, it progresses and causes complica- tions, such as organ failure (mainly in the liver and kidney) [6], septic shock, pulmonary edema, severe pneumonia, and ARDS, which eventually may lead to death [7 ].Morbidity and mortality are more common in the elderly and people with underlying diseases [8 ].There is currently no effective treatment for COVID-19.
The first-line treat- ment is to relieve the symptoms with painkiller drugs, such as acetaminophen and naproxen, and other medicines like diphenhydramine, etc. In severe cases, oxygen therapy is required.In some patients, anti-influenza drugs, such as oseltamivir and other drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine and doxycycline, are prescribed [ 9].Due to the effect of the virus on T lymphocytes and consequent disruption of the immune system, infected patients may become susceptible to bacterial infections; therefore, antibiotic therapy may also be necessary [7 ].Studies have not yet fully elucidated the pathophysiology of this disease [10].
In COVID-19 patients, an increase in inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoat- tractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory pro- tein 1-alpha (MIP1A), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), is observed which is called “cytokine storm” [ 5]. The release of cytokines, which are effective regulators of inflammatory responses, stimulates the secretion of many glycoproteins, such as C-reactive protein, from the liver.This protein, in turn, controls and regulates the inflammatory processes [11].Therefore, it seems that the reduction of serum CRP levels in affected patients can probably be promising in reducing some complications of the disease, such as cardiovascular risks.
Despite the development of several vaccines for COVID- 19, there are doubts about the complete eradication of the disease because of the genetic changes that occur in the virus’s genome. In October 2022 FDA has approved Rem- desivir for the treatment of COVID-19, besides, some medications such as Molnupiravir are in advanced stages of approval.Due to the nature of COVID-19, which is an infectious and inflammatory disease, L-carnitine may be considered a suitable therapeutic supplement as it has shown promising results in some viral infections related to the respiratory system [12].However, there is little evidence for the effect of this compound in COVID-19 patients.L-carnitine (beta-hydroxy-gamma N -trimethyl amino- butyric acid) is a cofactor for transporting fatty acids from the mitochondrial membrane to the matrix and plays an important role in fatty acids metabolism.
L-carnitine reduces the production of ketone bodies by reducing the level of fatty acids and their lower entry into hepatocytes, decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation [13]. 75% of L-carnitine reaches the body through food, and the rest is made from the lysine and methionine amino acids in the liver and kid- neys.About 95% of L-carnitine is stored in skeletal mus- cle, and a small amount is accumulated in the brain, heart, and sperm [14].L-carnitine is also used in treating heart disease, including irregular heartbeat, myocardial infarc- tion (cardiomyopathy), angina, and ischemia [ 15].Taking high doses of L-carnitine stimulates immune system func- tion and improves neutrophil and macrophage function.This improvement in function is due to the effect of L-carnitine on glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the produc- tion of macrophage inhibitory factor-1 (MIF1) in neutro - phils [16].
This supplement reduces leukotriene synthesis by inactivating the lipoxygenase process and reducing lung tissue inflammation [ 17]. L-carnitine is thought to reduce muscle cell damage and ultimately reduce the production of inflammatory proteins in patients and athletes by increasing intracellular membrane stability [13].Recently, it has been reported that the carnitine level of the body is negatively correlated with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.So, an increase in the carnitine amount was associated with lower vulnerability to COVID-19 [18].Also, another study used a combined metabolic activators regimen that included l-carnitine, and results showed that treating patients with this regimen accelerate the recovery period of COVID-19 [19].In the present study, we investigate the effect of L-car - nitine supplementation alone on the level of inflamma- tory parameters in patients with COVID-19.
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the extent of changes in inflammatory factors, such as CRP and ESR, following L-carnitine supplementation. Materials and methods Participation This clinical trial was performed on hospitalized COVID- 19 patients in Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Hamadan (IRAN).The target population was patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed based on Iranian ministry of health guidelines and hospitalized with mild-to-moderate disease.This study was approved by the ethics committee of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences with IR.UMSHA.1298 S.S.Talebi et al.1 3 REC.1399.650 ethics code and registered in the Iranian Reg- istry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20200921048794N1).Inclusion criteria included: age above 18 and below 60 years, positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, hospitalization, infection with coronavirus, and mild-to- moderate disease severity (according to the ministry of health guidelines).
Exclusion criteria included: Pregnancy, lactation, severe cardiovascular disease, having other infec- tions such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), history of taking L-carnitine supplement in the last month, requires intensive care units (ICU), patients with high and critical disease severity, taking anti-inflammatory drugs out of the patient's medication regimen and the patient's unwillingness to continue cooperating with investigators. Study design This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double- blind, and pilot clinical trial evaluating L-carnitine effect in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 hospitalized in Shahid Beheshti Hospital, (Hamadan, IRAN).After diagnosis by the relevant specialist physician and obtain- ing informed consent, the patient’s characteristics including demographic characteristics (age, sex), marital status and underlying diseases were registered.
The patients were randomly divided into intervention and control groups after providing informed written consent. Assignment of patients into control or intervention groups was random block; briefly we put three A sheets (control) and two B sheets (intervention) in an envelope and each time we randomly picked one of the sheets and assigned the patient to the control or intervention groups, respectively.The removed sheet was not returned to the envelope until the other sheets in the envelope were finished.After pulling out all five sheets randomly, all sheets were returned to the drawer and this procedure was continued for the next five patients until the desired sample size was reached.The control group received only their routine hospital treatment, including remdesivir, beta-interferon, and dexa- methasone.
In addition to the routine medication, the inter - vention group received 1000 mg oral L-carnitine tablet (Karen pharmaceutical Company, Iran) every 8 h for five days (3 gr daily). At the start of the study (before receiving the drug) and at the end of the study (five days after receiving the drug), 7 ml blood samples were taken from patients in the hospital and transferred to the laboratory.The level of inflammatory factors and other serum factors, such as CRP, ESR, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, platelet, hemoglobin, hematocrit (HCT), alanine transami- nase (ALT), aspartate transaminase, ALP, LDH, urea, creati- nine, sodium, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), international normalized ratio (INR), and CPK, were measured in blood tests.O2 saturation level was also measured with a pulse oximeter in the hospital.Clinical out- comes including fever, cough, and death were also recorded.
Statistical analysis Qualitative data were presented as frequency (and per - centage), and compared using a χ2 test. Quantitative data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and a two-sided T-test was used to compare the means between the intervention and control groups.The analyses were per - formed by SPSS 24 software at a 95% confidence interval level (CI).Results Demographics and patient’s characteristics Figure 1 illustrates a flow chart of the trial process.During the study period, 221 patients were screened for eligibil- ity.Of the 114 patients who were eligible for inclusion in the study, 38 patients were excluded according to our study exclusion criteria, and 76 patients participated in the study, including 43 individuals assigned to the control and 33 to the intervention group (Fig.1).The mean age of patients in the control and intervention groups was 45.04 ± 14.19 and 43.40 ± 8.42 years, respectively.
The mean body weight was 74.34 ± 10.43 kg in the control and 80.28 ± 14.33 kg in the intervention group (p = 0.121, by T-test). The patient’s characteristics are listed in Table 1.Twenty- five (58.1%) patients in the control group and 18 (56.3%) patients in the intervention group were males, and there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of sex (p = 0.184; χ2 test).Six (14%) patients in the control group and 4 (12.5%) patients in the intervention group had university degrees, and a significant difference regarding education level (p = 0.029; χ2 test) between the two groups was observed.In the control and intervention groups, 43 (95.3%) and 29 (90.6%) patients were married, respectively (p = 0.260; χ2 test).Additionally, 21 (48.8%) patients in the control group and 19 (59.4%) patients in the interven- tion group had no underlying diseases.
In contrast, others suffered from conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Hodgkin lymphoma, sei- zure, cancer, and other diseases (p = 0.008; χ2 test) (Table 1). Para‑clinical test result The results of the para-clinical examination are listed in Table 2.

1 3 urea, creatinine, and PTT were different between the two control and intervention groups at the beginning of the study (p ˂0.05; two-sided T -test) while other parameters including CRP, ferritin, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, platelet, Hb, ALT, AST, ALP, Sodium, PT, INR, and CPK were the same with no statisti- cal differences (p ˃ 0.05; two-sided T -test). After the treat- ment, significant changes in some para-clinical parameters were seen.A higher mean of O2 saturation (Adjusted p value = 0.039; two-sided T-test) was observed in the inter - vention rather than in the control group.In addition, mean ESR and CRP, as indicators of inflammation, were sig- nificantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control (p = 0.021 and p = 0.009, respectively; two-sided T-test).Furthermore, a significant slight decrease in mean Hb was observed in the intervention rather than in the control group after treatment (p = 0.026; two-sided T-test).
Also, mean ALP and LDH activity were lower in the intervention compared to the control group significantly (p = 0.010 and p = 0.002, respectively; two-sided T-test). Additionally, lower mean CPK was also observed in the intervention group, which was statistically significant (p = 0.019; two-sided T-test).However, there were insig- nificant differences in the other para-clinical parameters between the control and intervention groups (p ˃ 0.05; two- sided T-test) (Table 2).Clinical outcomes The frequencies of primary outcomes, including fever, cough, and death are listed in Table 3.Twenty-five (58.1%) patients in the control and 19 (59.4%) patients in the inter - vention group had fever.Cough was seen in 28 patients in the control group (65.1%) and 19 patients in the intervention group (59.4%), in which differences were insignificant and no differences in patients clinical symptoms were observed during the five days of the study.
As a result, in the entire population we studied, 47 (62.6%) patients had cough and 44 (58.6%) patients had fever, which are common symptoms of this disease.
Finally, 6 (14%) patients in the control group died due to the complications of COVID-19, while all the patients in the intervention group survived (p = 0.030; χ2 test) (Table 3).Table 1 Patient’s characteristics in control and intervention groups *χ2Variable Control N (%) Intervention N (%) χ2p* Sample size Sex Male 25 (58.1%) 18 (56.2%) 0.027 0.184 75 Female 18 (41.9%) 14 (43.8%) Education No 11 (25.6%) 2 (6.3%) 5.836 0.029* 75 None-college educated 26 (60.4%) 26 (81.3%) Collage educated 6 (14%) 4 (12.4%) Marital status Single 2 (4.7%) 3 (9.4%) 0.658 0.260 75 Married 41 (95.3%) 29 (90.6%) Underlying disease No 21 (48.8%) 19 (59.3%) 7.685 0.008* 75 Hypertension 2 (4.7%) 3 (9.4%) Diabetes 2 (4.7%) 1 (3.1%) Hypothyroidism 1 (2.3%) 2 (6.3%) Hyperthyroidism 0 (0%) 1 (3.1%) MS 1 (2.3%) 0 (0%) RA 3 (7%) 1 (3.1%) Hodgkin lymphoma 2 (4.7%) 0 (0%) Seizure 1 (2.3%) 0 (0%) Cancer 1 (2.3%) 0 (0%) Hypertension and Diabetes 5 (11.6%) 3 (9.4%) Others 4 (9.3%) 2 (6.3%) 1301 Effects of L‑carnitine supplementation in patients with mild‑to‑moderate COVID‑19 disease:… 1 3Table 2 Clinical examination results Parameter Group Before treatment After treatment Adjusted p value n Mean SD Mean diff p t value df n Mean SD Mean diff p t value df O2 saturation Control 43 90.4186 4.03103 − 2.33140 0.000 − 2.936 73 43 92.2791 2.41351 − 1.65843 0.000 − 3.525 73 0.039* Intervention 32 92.7500 2.28600 − 2.33140 32 93.9375 1.29359 − 1.65843 CRP Control 43 1.8837 1.11717 0.28997 0.779 1.143 73 43 1.6233 2.15548 1.31076 0.021*3.358 73 Intervention 32 1.5938 1.04293 0.28997 32 0.3125 .53506 1.31076 ESR Control 43 54.1512 30.70027 20.68241 0.002 3.370 73 43 43.0349 30.74674 23.09738 0.000 4.124 73 0.009* Intervention 32 33.4688 18.71688 20.68241 32 19.9375 8.63951 23.09738 Ferritin Control 11 381.6364 304.88203 − 3.59441 0.064 − 0.036 22 10 338.4000 192.51620 − 40.21538 0.772 − 0.517 21 Intervention 13 385.2308 169.50327 − 3.59441 13 378.6154 179.14033 − 40.21538 WBC count Control 43 7397.6744 5722.6987 1869.5494 0.021 1.744 73 43 8060.4651 5057.1562 660.46512 0.163 0.670 73 Intervention 32 5528.1250 2302.6260 1869.5494 32 7400.0000 2713.4076 660.46512 Neutrophil Control 43 75.2791 11.37735 6.09157 0.544 2.308 73 43 79.7674 11.19489 11.14244 0.861 4.283 73 Intervention 32 69.1875 11.20322 6.09157 32 68.6250 11.07089 11.14244 Lymphocyte Control 43 20.3488 10.46282 − 6.52616 0.463 − 2.719 73 43 16.8372 10.30703 − 10.78779 0.287 − 4.671 73 Intervention 32 26.8750 10.03140 − 6.52616 32 27.6250 9.30054 − 10.78779 Monocyte Control 43 2.8605 1.72629 0.17297 0.629 0.467 73 43 2.3953 1.57570 − 0.26090 0.566 − 0.636 73 Intervention 32 2.6875 1.37811 0.17297 32 2.6563 1.97744 − 0.26090 Platelet Control 43 193.2558 89.50874 2.56831 0.697 0.134 73 43 218.6744 81.95170 − 4.26308 0.611 − 0.232 73 Intervention 32 190.6875 71.63908 2.56831 32 222.9375 74.03484 − 4.26308 Hb Control 43 12.9000 2.44316 − 1.46250 0.083 − 2.861 73 43 12.5884 2.47658 − 1.58975 0.026*− 3.124 73 Intervention 32 14.3625 1.78845 − 1.46250 32 14.1781 1.69682 − 1.58975 HCT Control 43 38.9930 6.49213 − 4.39448 0.021 − 3.321 73 43 38.1233 6.21985 − 4.85799 0.248 − 3.653 73 0.124 Intervention 32 43.3875 4.30632 − 4.39448 32 42.9813 4.90006 − 4.85799 ALT Control 42 39.9286 29.04697 1.52232 0.682 0.228 72 43 67.5814 39.27027 − 1.60610 0.804 − 0.174 73 Intervention 32 38.4063 27.55272 1.52232 32 69.1875 39.74470 − 1.60610 AST Control 43 33.0000 19.67837 1.28125 0.893 0.280 73 43 43.7209 21.20122 0.81468 0.407 0.140 73 Intervention 32 31.7188 19.48073 1.28125 32 42.9063 29.37341 0.81468 ALP Control 40 180.7750 93.51662 − 7.52500 0.273 − .0374 68 40 193.5750 98.69401 6.24167 0.010 0.326 68 Intervention 30 188.3000 67.24641 − 7.52500 30 187.3333 40.96789 6.24167 LDH Control 37 676.2703 247.77528 169.60360 0.005 2.889 56 39 664.1282 386.49560 242.65201 0.003 2.819 58 0.002** Intervention 21 506.6667 137.14785 169.60360 21 421.4762 97.25462 242.65201 Urea Control 43 35.8140 20.07635 11.25145 0.000 3.073 73 43 38.0930 16.75000 8.15552 0.002 2.550 73 0.547 Intervention 32 24.5625 5.74140 11.25145 32 29.9375 7.85324 8.15552 Creatinine Control 43 1.0491 0.41734 0.11188 0.006 1.438 73 43 0.9244 0.21085 − 0.05621 0.050 − 1.294 73 Intervention 32 0.9372 0.16005 0.11188 32 0.9806 0.14607 − 0.05621 Sodium Control 43 137.3953 6.00848 0.33285 0.209 0.293 73 43 137.2558 5.03366 − 0.99419 0.206 − 1.021 73 Intervention 32 137.0625 2.61432 0.33285 32 138.2500 2.57782 − 0.99419 1302 S.
S. Talebi et al.1 3 Discussion In the current study, the potential benefits of L-carnitine sup- plementation in patients with COVID-19 disease have been evaluated.Statistical analyses revealed that L-carnitine sup- plementation can decrease inflammation caused by infection, increase oxygen saturation levels and decrease liver enzymes levels.The results of this study showed that the adminis- tration of L-carnitine significantly improves blood oxygen saturation in COVID-19 patients.As a result, the need for the ventilator decreased in patients.Following the spread of infection from the upper respiratory tract to the lungs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV2) infects the lung cells through a specific ACE2 recep- tor, which destroys these cells, leading to decreased oxygen saturation.It has been reported that a higher carnitine level was causally associated with decreased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.
Increased percentage of oxygen satu- ration as a result of L-carnitine supplementation in patients can accelerate the recovery of symptoms. This improved oxygen saturation may be due to decreased ACE2 expression and thus inhibition of virus binding to lung cells [18].In this regard, Bellamine et al.showed that L-carnitine can reduce the expression of ACE2 in human pulmonary epithelial cells in vitro as well as in clinical conditions in animal models and humans [20].The effect of L-carnitine on reducing ACE2 expression is through its effect on increasing hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4-α) level [ 21].HNF4-α play a direct role in lowering ACE2 expression [22].
The results of another study using a lamb model with increased pulmo- nary blood flow showed that chronic l-carnitine treatment alleviates changes in lung carnitine homeostasis, reduces associated oxidative stress, and improves pulmonary mito- chondrial function, NO signaling and eventually endothelial function [23].ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP C-reactive protein, ALP alkaline phosphatase activity, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, CPK serum creatine phosphokinase, PT prothrombin time, PTT partial thromboplastin time, INR international normalized ratio, WBC white blood cell, HCT hematocrit *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001Table 2 (continued) Parameter Group Before treatment After treatment Adjusted p value n Mean SD Mean diff p t value df n Mean SD Mean diff p t value df PT Control 43 12.2767 2.95642 0.56737 0.064 1.037 73 43 12.4674 1.69449 0.06119 0.021*0.192 73 Intervention 32 11.7094 1.04491 0.56737 32 12.4063 0.71389 0.06119 PTT Control 43 25.6442 4.08320 0.41919 0.032 0.546 73 43 25.6860 5.16654 − 0.37958 0.477 − 0.396 73 Intervention 32 25.2250 1.69401 0.41919 32 26.0656 1.85483 − 0.37958 INR Control 43 1.1258 0.31020 0.06485 0.107 1.101 72 43 1.1088 0.16681 − 0.03536 0.635 − 0.952 72 Intervention 31 1.0610 0.12300 0.06485 31 1.1442 0.14366 − 0.03536 CPK Control 9 133.4444 135.43459 72.44444 0.156 1.411 15 6 343.0000 612.50992 284.00000 0.019*1.328 12 Intervention 8 61.0000 54.47411 72.44444 8 59.0000 31.65890 284.00000Table 3 The primary outcomes of patient’s in control and interven- tion groups *χ2Outcome Control N (%)Intervention N (%)χ2p* Sample size Fever No 18 (41.9%) 13 (40.6%) 0.012 0.186 75 Yes 25 (58.1%) 19 (59.4%) Cough No 15 (34.9%) 13 (40.6%) 0.258 0.167 75 Yes 28 (65.1%) 19 (59.4%) Death No 37 (86%) 32 (100%) 4.853 0.030* 75 Yes 6 (14%) 0 (0%) 1303 Effects of L‑carnitine supplementation in patients with mild‑to‑moderate COVID‑19 disease:… 1 3 In the present study, considerable increase in inflamma- tory factors, such as CRP and ESR, has been observed dur - ing infection and inflammation caused by COVID-19.
On the other hand, according to the obtained results, the mean CRP and ESR levels in patients receiving L-carnitine were significantly reduced. As a result, reducing these factors can be indicated an improvement in the disease process.In this regard, Liu et al.by examining 78 patients admitted to Wuhan Hospital in China, showed an increased CRP level in patients with COVID-19 [24].Similar results were observed in a study by Mardani et al.on COVID-19 patients in Iran [25].In addition, some studies show the role of L-carnitine supplementation in reducing inflammation and thus reducing CRP and ESR in hemodialysis patients [14].Bellamine et al.showed that L-carnitine reduces serum CRP levels in rodents infected with the SARS-CoV2 virus and in patients with COVID-19 [ 20].L-carnitine increases ACE1 and decreases ACE2 in lung and muscle tissue, thereby reducing inflam - mation by converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which plays an anti-inflammatory role [26].
However, L-carnitine and its active form, acetyl-carnitine, are involved in the sys- temic reduction of inflammation by reducing inflammatory factors and cytokines, such as CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α [27]. Since cytokine storms cause the progression of COVID- 19 disease, the use of L-carnitine can prevent the progress of infections [28].It should also be noted that L-carnitine inhibits lipid peroxidation, reduces oxidative stress, such as ROS, improves mitochondrial function, and thus plays a pivotal role in reducing inflammation [29].Additionally, L-carnitine is thought to be a booster of the immune system (such as increasing the function of macrophages), which is involved in reducing infection and inflammation [30].In this study, we found that L-carnitine did not change the mean levels of liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, but prevented the excessive increase in ALP levels.However, some studies have shown increased levels of liver enzymes during COVID-19 [31].
Numerous studies have demon- strated the role of L-carnitine in lowering liver damage by reducing the levels of liver enzymes, such as ALT, AST and ALP [32]. In addition, regenerative glutathione synthesis in the liver is reduced during liver injury.L-Carnitine has antioxidant properties and reduces glutathione by reducing thiol groups [33].Our study showed that L-carnitine decreases urea and creatinine levels in patients, although only a significant dif- ference in urea levels was observed between the two groups.Some studies have shown that urea is increased in patients with COVID-19 [11].L-carnitine is considered a therapeu- tic supplement in patients with kidney disease, and those who need hemodialysis.The administration of L-carnitine in renal patients is associated with a decrease in urea and creatinine, which is due to the improvement of the body's overall metabolism in patients and a reduction in protein catabolism [34].
The results of our study showed that L-carnitine supple- mentation reduced PT time, although it did not alter PTT and INR. Increased PT is an essential feature of COVID-19 and is a risk factor for disease severity and poor prognosis.High PT is caused by defects in the coagulation system and thrombocytopenia [35].Previous studies have also shown that L-carnitine reduces PT time in liver patients such as those with encephalopathy [36].The effect of L-carnitine in reducing PT time is due to its antioxidant properties in the liver, which protects liver cells from damage [37].Our results showed that L-carnitine significantly reduces the mean CPK and LDH in patients compared to the control group.CPK is found mainly in skeletal mus- cle and brain, and its increase indicates damage to these tissues.LDH is also found in abundance in all body cells and plays a direct role in energy metabolism.
Any increase in the levels of these enzymes indicates the presence of a defect in one of the body’s organs. In some patients with COVID-19, damage to organs such as muscles has been reported, resulting in increased CPK and LDH enzymes.Some studies have shown that L-carnitine reduces damage to muscles and organs of the body, such as the kidneys and reduces CPK and LDH levels in patients [38].Looking for a comparison between the control and intervention groups, we found that the frequency of patients who had cough or fever after the treatment did not significantly differ.However, death was not observed in any patients receiving L-carnitine.First, the reduction in death from disease can be due to an increase in the level of saturated oxygen in the blood, which facilitates oxygen delivery and thus stops the progression of the disease.
Sec- ond, L-carnitine may reduce the inflammatory processes, prevent the virus from attaching to the host cell by reduc- ing ACE2, and regulate energy metabolism, thereby pre- venting patient mortality. However, for definitive conclu- sions, more studies with larger sample sizes are needed.L-Carnitine acts as a cofactor and vitamin-like and can regulate metabolic pathways.This compound is naturally present in all body cells, albeit small.However, in some people, especially elderly patients and people who are not adequately nourished, this factor may decrease.Therefore, the use of L-carnitine as a supplement can play an impor - tant role in the recovery of such patients.In our study, death due to complications of COVID-19 was not observed in the group receiving L-carnitine, although 40.6% of patients in the intervention group had underlying diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes.In line with our study, Rothkopf et al.
also showed that a combination supplement containing multivitamins, zinc, thiamine, ergocalciferol, pyridoxine, and, carnitine helped improve the treatment of elderly patients with COVID-19 [39]. 1304 S.S.Talebi et al.1 3 A limitation of our study was the short duration of L-carnitine administration; so the treatment was per - formed for five days.Also, treatment in patients hospital- ized in Iran is based on the administration of remdesi- vir or favipiravir and it was impossible to investigate the interaction between L-carnitine and these antiviral drugs.Additionally, the study was a single-center investigation.
Conclusion The results obtained in the present study indicate the use of L-carnitine in patients with COVID-19, could contrib- ute to the reduction of inflammation caused by infection, oxygen delivery improvement by increasing oxygen satura- tion levels, normalization of elevated liver enzymes, regu- lation of the body's energy metabolism, and ultimately reduce clinical mortality through multiple metabolic pathways. As a result, L-carnitine can be suggested as a pharmacological supplement in patients with COVID-19, but further research and clinical studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm and extend the results of this study.Supplementary Information The online version contains supplemen- tary material available at https:// doi.org/ 10.1007/ s43440- 022- 00402-y .Acknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this study provided by Hamadan University of Medical Science.
