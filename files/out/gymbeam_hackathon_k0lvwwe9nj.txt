Using com-binations of yeast mutants, we found that a mildly decreasedsynthesis of PRPP affects biomass production, resulting inreduced cell size, while a more severe decrease ends up affectingyeast doubling time. We establish that it is PRPP itself that is limiting in invalid PRPP-synthetase mutants and that the resulting metabolic and growth defect can be bypassed by propersupplementation of the medium with ribose-containing pre-cursors or by the expression of bacterial or human PRPP-synthetase.In addition, using documented pathologic humanhyperactive forms of PRPP-synthetase, we show that intracel-lular PRPP as well as its derived products can be increased inboth human and yeast cells, and we describe the ensuing meta- bolic and physiological consequences.Finally, we found that PRPP consumption appears to take place “on demand ”by the various PRPP-utilizing pathways, as shown by blocking orincreasing the ﬂux in speci ﬁcP R P P - c o n s u m i n gm e t a b o l i cr o u t e s .
Overall, our work reveals important similarities between humanand yeast for both synthesis and consumption of PRPP. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP; Fig.1 A) has two key functions ( 1).At ﬁrst, it contributes to a large part of NADP reduction through its oxidative branch and, second, it providesribose-5-phosphate, an obligatory precursor of the synthesis ofall nucleotides and derivatives, through the non-oxidativebranch.In addition, the PPP produces C3 to C7 metabolites, of which erythrose-4-phosphate is used in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids.Hence, the PPP is central to anabolism,notably through the synthesis of pentose for nucleotides andthe supply of NADP(H) which is involved in most anabolicoxydo-reductive reactions.
Therefore, under proliferationconditions, a portion of the carbon ﬂux is routed to PPP and used for anabolism and de novo biomass formation.Synthesis of NADPH by the PPP is particularly important for human erythrocytes and a de fect in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), the ﬁrst step of the oxidative branch of PPP from glucose-6-phosphate, results in hemo-lytic anemia ( 2). In yeast cells, NADPH synthesis viathe PPP is also important but essentially under oxidative stress con-ditions or when a signi ﬁcant amount of NADPH is needed for sulfur assimilation.Accordingly, the yeast zwf1 mutant lacking G6PDH activity is hyper-sensitive to oxidizing agents and is an auxotroph for methionine ( 3).
Importantly, while most of the genes encoding enzymes of the PPP are notessential in yeast ( 4–8),RKI1 encoding ribose-5-phosphate ketol-isomerase is indispensable for yeast survival ( 9), pre- sumably due to its critical role in synthesizing ribose-5-phosphate, which is an essential metabolite required fornucleotide biosynthesis. In fact, ribose-5-phosphate is never used as such in biosynthesis reactions; it ﬁrst has to be activated to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), the ﬁnal product of PPP, by a family of enzymes named PRPP-synthetases ( Fig.1 A).In budding yeast, PRPP-synthetases are multimeric en- zymes.There are ﬁve genes, PRS1-5 , encoding PRPP synthe- tase subunits.Based on speci ﬁc activity measurements from single and combined knockout (KO) ( 10,11), as well as single and combined expression of the yeast subunits in E.coli (12), it was concluded that Prs1 with Prs3 form the major enzymecomplex, while Prs2-Prs5 and Prs4-Prs5 form two minorcomplexes.
Of note, Prs1 and Prs5 carry additional non-homologous regions which interact with the cell wall integ-rity pathway ( 13,14). Importantly, prs1 andprs3 individual KO resulted in a severe growth defect while only combinations ofKO comprising members of both the Prs1-Prs3 and the Prs2- Prs5 complexes were synthetic lethal ( 10).Finally, prs1 and prs3 mutants had low intracellular nucleotides ( 10).However, it is not yet established whether the slow growth of thesemutants is the direct consequence of limiting amounts ofPRPP or whether there are unrelated effects of the deletion ofthePRS1 orPRS3 genes.In yeast, PRPP can be used in enzy- matic reactions, in ﬁve different synthesis pathways, catalyzed by 11 phosphoribosyl transferases ( Fig.1 A)(15): purine nucleotide biosynthesis (Ade4, Apt1, Hpt1, Xpt1); pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis (Ura5, Ura10, Fur1); pyridine cofactor*For correspondence: Bertrand Daignan-Fornier, b.daignan-fornier@ibgc.cnrs.fr .

Biol.Chem.(2023) 299(8) 105011 the most highly expressed isoform and is mutated in a whole range of genetic diseases ( 18).Interestingly, several distinct syndromes are associated with speci ﬁc mutations in PRPS1, either decreasing or increasing its activity ( 18).It hence ap- pears that in humans, the level of PRPP synthetase must beﬁnely tuned to a given physiological level.In addition, several lines of evidence support the central role of PRPS1 and PRPS2 in tumor progression and resistance to anti-cancer drugs.
Increased activity of PRPS1 was shown responsible for thio-purine resistance in relapsed childhood Acute LymphoblasticLeukemia (ALL) ( 19), as well as cisplatin resistance in breast cancer cells ( 20). Besides the drug resistance effects, increased PRPS1 expression was found to result in an anti-apoptotic effect in B-ALL cell lines and was associated with a poorprognosis for disease progression ( 21).Finally, activation of PRPS1 by keto hexokinase-A drives hepatocellular carcinoma formation ( 22).PRPS2, although it is dispensable in mice, is required for Myc-driven tumorigenesis ( 23) leading to an interesting alternative strategy to indirectly target the“undruggable ”Myc protein.More recently, PRPS2 over- expression was found to increase cell migration and invasionand proposed to drive colorectal cancer metastasis ( 24).The requirement for PRPP for all the nucleotide synthesis pathways makes the synthesis of PRPP an interesting metabolic bottle- neck that could be targeted.
PRPS1 and PRPS2 are thusgenerating growing attention for their roles in cancer cells.However, the physiological ﬁne-tuning of PRPS activity, affected in several diseases, makes it challenging to targetPRPS. Therefore, a better understanding of PRPP synthesisand utilization is required.In this work, we ﬁrst established that the synthesis of ribose- 5-phosphate and PRPP is the essential function of PPP in yeast.We then aimed at deciphering how PRPP synthesis and con-sumption affect metabolism and proliferation in yeast cells.We report that PRPP synthetase, but not ribose-5-phosphate,is limiting PRPP synthesis.We also show that PRPP-utilizingenzymes compete for PRPP and that, under physiologicalconditions, PRPP is limiting for nucleotide synthesis but notfor proliferation and that it is competitively consumed by the downstream pathways.Finally, we investigated PRPP meta- bolism in human cells and found that the main conclusionsdrawn from yeast apply quite similarly to human cells.
Results Synthesis of ribose-5-phosphate and PRPP is the essentialfunction of PPP in yeast As mentioned above, RKI1 is the only essential gene in the PPP. This is most likely due to the fact that the PPP can be fedby the glycolysis pathway viaseveral intermediates, namely, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, and glyceralde-hyde-3-phosphate ( Fig.1 A).It ensues that there is a redun- dancy in the synthesis of PPP intermediates with a possibleexception for ribose-5-phosphate synthesized by Rki1 and forits derived product, PRPP, synthesized by Prs1-5 which are also essential for yeast cells in combinations ( 10).We thus hypothesized that the lethality associated with rki1knock-outshould be bypassed if essential metabolites requiring PRPP for their synthesis were provided as supplements to the growthmedium.These metabolites are purines, pyrimidines, pyri-dines, and amino acids ( Fig.1 B).
The supplementation could not simply be done by feeding the cells with preformed nu-cleotides since nucleotides are not taken up by yeast cells. Wehence fed the cells with nucleosides, which are nucleotide precursors carrying the ribose moiety but no phosphate.The nucleosides provided to cells were adenosine, uridine, andnicotinamide riboside (Nr) for purines, pyrimidines, andpyridines, respectively.Of note, since Nr is chemically un-stable, cells were fed with nicotinamide mononucleotide thatis metabolized to Nr by the Pho5 phosphatase enzymatic ac-tivity and immediately taken up by the Nrt1 permease, asshown previously ( 25).Since adenosine is not taken up ef ﬁ- ciently in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , we expressed a human nucleoside transporter (hENT1) to facilitate uptake.
In addi-tion, tryptophan and histidine were supplied to bypass therequirement of PRPP for the synthesis of these amino acids.This combination of nucleoside and amino-acid supplementsclearly bypassed the inviable phenotype of the rki1 mutant (Fig. 1 B) lacking ribose-5-phosphate ketol-isomerase and hence unable to synthesize ribose-5-phosphate from ribulose- 5-phosphate ( Fig.1 A).We conclude that the main function of the non-oxidative branch of the PPP, in yeast, is to provideribose-5-phosphate that is used for nucleotide and amino acidsynthesis viathe synthesis of PRPP by Prs1-5.PRPP synthesis from ribose-5-phosphate hence appears to be the essentialrole of the PPP in yeast.Metabolic and phenotypic effects of alterations in the yeast PRPP synthetase genes We then evaluated the metabolic and phenotypic contri- butions of the various yeast PRPP-synthetase isoforms in anisogenic prototrophic background.
Prototrophic strains wereused to ensure that the observed effects did not result frommetabolic interferences with the auxotrophic markerscommonly used to facilitate genetic studies in yeast and which often affect PRPP-requiring pathways. Two mutant strains lacking either the major enzyme ( prs1 prs3 double knock-out mutant) or the minor forms ( prs2 prs4 prs5 triple knock-out mutant) were compared with an isogenic wild-type strain.Intracellular PRPP was in the 0.1 mM range for the wild-typestrain, lowered by 25% in the prs2 prs4 prs5 triple mutant, and was decreased almost 10-fold in the prs1 prs3 mutant ( Fig.2 A).This result is in good agreement with previous results showing a much more severe defect in PRPP synthetase activity in the prs1 prs3 mutant than in the prs2 prs4 prs5 triple mutant ( 10).Of note, the concentration of PRPP in yeast cells is way belowthe concentration of nucleotides which is around 4 mM for thesum of adenylic nucleotides (AXP) alone ( Fig.2 B).
This sug- gests that PRPP is not stored but rather utilized on demand. The effects of the mutations on intracellular PRPP ( Fig.2 A) were associated with a signi ﬁcant decrease in the ability of the mutant cells to produce biomass, although the effect was much stronger in the case of the prs1 prs3 mutant ( Fig.2 C).PRPP synthesis and utilization in yeast and human J.Biol.Chem.(2023) 299(8) 105011 3 Quantifying biomass production rate does not allow, in a single measurement, to differentiate the effects on cell divisionfrom those on cell growth.We hence appraised these twoparameters separately, by measuring cell volume ( Fig.2 D) and population doubling time ( Fig.2 E).Clearly, in the triple prs2 prs4 prs5 mutant, the lower biomass production was associ- ated with a lower cell volume, while doubling time was notincreased ( Fig.2 ,Dand E).By contrast, in the prs1 prs3 mutant, both factors were severely affected ( Fig.2 ,DandE).
Finally, metabolic pro ﬁling of the three strains revealed that theprs1 prs3 mutant was the most affected strain for all four nucleotides as well as the sum of NAD +and NADH (hereafter referred as NAD(H)), while the prs2 prs4 prs5 mutant was less severely, although signi ﬁcantly, affected ( Figs. 2 B,3,A–E, and S1).Of note, by contrast to previously published data ( 10), we found that AXP, GXP, UXP, and CXP were all signi ﬁcantly affected in the prs2 prs4 prs5 mutant when compared to the isogenic wild-type strain ( Figs.2 Band 3,A–C).Thisdiscrepancy could be due to the fact that the strains used in our work are prototrophic, while in the previous work, theused strains were mutated in four PRPP-utilizing pathways(purine, pyrimidine, tryptophan, and histidine).Interestingly,uracil, adenine and hypoxanthine, three pyrimidine and purineprecursors, were higher in the prs1 prs3 mutant than in the control strain ( Fig.
3 ,E–G), suggesting that the low PRPP level in the mutant limited their consumption by the cognate phosphoribosyl transferases ( Fig. 1 A).We conclude that decreasing intracellular PRPP ( Fig.2 A), and subsequently intracellular nucleotides ( Figs.2 Band 3, A–D), severely affected biomass production rate in both prs mutants ( Fig.2 C), while division, as revealed by population doubling time, was only affected in the prs1prs3 mutant but not signi ﬁcantly in the prs2 prs4 prs5 mutant ( Fig.2 E).Hence, PRPP shortage, apparently, ﬁrst affected cell growth (size decrease, Fig.2 D) before slowing down cell division (doubling time increase, Fig.2 E).AB CD E Figure 2.

Of note, due to the presence of the two plasmids, the yeast strainsand the growth media used in Figures 3 and4are different. The metabolic effects of PRS1 /PRS3 overexpression, increased PRPP ( Fig.4 A), as well as nucleotide and NAD(H) concen- trations ( Fig.4 ,B–F).This result shows that increasing PRPP synthesis in yeast can signi ﬁcantly increase intracellular nu- cleotides.Accordingly, the purine intermediate metabolitesIMP and inosine were also very signi ﬁcantly increased ( Fig.4 , Gand H), as previously reported for purine overproducing ADE4 dominant mutants ( 25).However, nucleotide over- production did not improve yeast growth and division.Indeed,when considering the physiological consequences of PRS1 / PRS3 overexpression, we observed that it negatively increased the population doubling time ( Fig.4 I) and diminished the biomass production rate ( Fig.4 J), while it had no signi ﬁcant effect on cell size ( Fig.4 K).
This establishes that there is no strict proportional relationship between PRPP concentrationand generation time or cell size and that the connection be-tween metabolism and these traits is probably more complex.The metabolic burden imposed by increased synthesis of nu- cleotides and accumulation of intermediates such as IMP and inosine in the mM range ( Fig. 4 ,GandH) could be responsiblefor the higher doubling time by diverting a signi ﬁcant part of glucose from glycolysis to nucleotide synthesis viathe PPP.
Phenotypic and metabolic rescue of the yeast prs1prs3 mutant by exogenous supplementation or expression ofhuman and bacterial PRPS genes It should be stressed that the results on doubling time and biomass do not allow us to conclude whether these effects areconsequences of the decreased intracellular nucleotide levels.It could in part be due to lower intracellular PRPP, indepen-dent of its effect on nucleotides, or alternatively to a possiblemoonlighting role of PRPS independently of its catalyticactivity. First, to establish that PRPP synthesis is indeed the limiting factor for proliferation in the prs1 prs3 mutant, we expressed the monomeric human PRPP synthetases, PRPS1 and PRPS2,as well as the E.coli enzyme (PrsA) under the control of a yeast promoter.Expression of the human or bacterial enzymesrestored colony growth on plates ( Fig.5 A) and doubling time in liquid cultures ( Fig.5 B).
Importantly, expression of the exogenous PRPS in yeast restored intracellular PRPP, althoughonly partially ( Fig. 5 C ).Similarly, expression of exogenous PRPS in yeast only partially, but signi ﬁcantly, restored nucle- otide levels, although to various extents, higher for purinesAB C DEF G Figure 3.Consequences of PRPP variations on nucleotide synthesis and precursor accumulation .Metabolic extractions and quanti ﬁcation were performed on wild-type (Y12325), prs1Δprs3Δ(Y12562), and prs2Δprs4Δprs5Δ(Y12649) exponentially grown for 24 h in SDcasaWAU medium, as in Figure 2 .For each nucleotide (N), [NXP] = [NTP] + [NDP]+ [NMP] (presented in Fig.S1 ).NAD(H) corresponds to the sum of the oxidized (NAD+) and reduced (NADH) form of the pyridine nucleotide.Each metabolite, nucleotide ( A–D), and precursor ( E–G) was quanti ﬁed from eight independent yeast cultures and metabolite extractions.

Biol.Chem.(2023) 299(8) 105011 5 than for pyrimidines for unknown reasons ( Fig.5 ,D–H).We conclude that synthesis of PRPP derivatives is apparently limiting for proliferation in the prs1 prs3 mutant and that partial restoration of the intracellular pools, by expression ofexogenous PRPS, is likely suf ﬁcient to recover doubling times not very different from that of the wild-type control.Of note,this result is highly consistent with the one observed previouslyfor the prs2 prs4 prs5 mutant ( Fig.2 E).It should be noted that the phenotypic and metabolic rescue by expression of bacterialPrsA or human PRPS in the prs1 prs3 mutant is probably contributed, in part, by the Prs2 Prs4 and Prs5 isoforms that are still present in this mutant ( 11).
We then asked whether it is PRPP itself or its derived products that is limiting the growth of the prs1 prs3 mutant. We intended to address this question by restoring higherintracellular nucleotides without restoring PRPP-synthetaseactivity.This was done as above for rki1 by feeding the cells with nucleosides and amino acids.Of note, histidine is con- tained in the casamino mixture added to the medium and is present in all conditions.The addition of each alone of theribose-containing precursors or ﬁnal products had little effect on the colony growth of a prs3 mutant ( Fig.S2 ); however, the combined addition of the supplements resulted in a signi ﬁcant improvement in colony growth ( Fig.6 A).Furthermore, the rescue of doubling time by the combination of supplementswas total in liquid cultures ( Fig.6 B), suggesting that the partial rescue effect observed on plates ( Fig.6 A) could be due to poor diffusion of the substrates in the agar plate, as previouslyreported ( 26).
Importantly, the addition of the supplements to theprs1 prs3 mutant did not increase intracellular PRPP concentration ( Fig. 6 C) but rather lowered it for a yet unun- derstood reason, while, as expected, it signi ﬁcantly increased all intracellular NTPs ( Fig.6 ,D–G) to levels comparable to those of the wild-type isogenic strain.Meanwhile, NAD(H)was only partially restored ( Fig.6 H), the metabolization of nicotinamide mononucleotide to Nr, and/or the uptake of Nrby Nrt1 being possibly limiting.We conclude that most of thegrowth defect of the prs1 prs3 mutant is due to its inability to synthesize a suf ﬁcient amount of PRPP-derived metabolites.Altogether, our results show that low synthesis of PRPP and more speci ﬁcally of its derived products, such as nucleotides, is the principal cause of the slow growth phenotype of the prs1 prs3 mutant.
Isolation and characterization of genetic suppressors of the prs1 prs3 mutant Having shown that supplementation or exogenous PRPS activity could rescue the prs1prs3 mutant slow growth, we then asked whether this proliferation phenotype could be sup-pressed genetically. Starting from a prs1 prs3 double KO mutant, we searched for suppressors that would alleviate thesevere colony growth defect of the mutant and therebypossibly reveal metabolic processes limiting proliferation.Because PRPP is a central molecule in metabolism, the experiment was done on prototrophic yeast to avoidAB CDE GH I J KF Figure 4.Metabolic and phenotypic consequences of PRS1-PRS3 overexpression.Wild-type (Y11451) strain was transformed with either the empty vectors (vectors, YepLac181 and YepLac195) or plasmids allowing overexpression of PRS1 (p6160) and PRPS3 (p5671) ( PRS1 +PRS3 ).
Transformants selected on SC -Ura -Leu medium were exponentially grown for 24 h in the same liquid medium before extractions and quanti ﬁcation of metabolites from eight independent cultures ( A–H) or determination of either the population doubling time ( I), the relative biomass production rate ( J) or the median volume ( K).

Finally, the PRS5-supp3 ,PRS5-supp11 and PRS5-supp48 mutant alleles suppressed prs1 prs3 when carried on either centromeric or multicopy plasmids, while the wild-type allele did not ( Fig.7 B), further con ﬁrming that they are necessary and suf ﬁcient suppressor mutations and revealing their dominance over the wild-type PRS5 allele.We conclude that several mutations in PRS5 can ef ﬁciently suppress the growth defect of the prs1 prs3 double mutant.All the testedPRS5 suppressor mutations were found dominant.A subset of three suppressors (P110S, R311I, and D401N) was furtheranalyzed revealing that the PRS5 suppressors decreased the population doubling time ( Fig.7 C) and had a signi ﬁcant effect on intracellular PRPP ( Fig.7 ) as well as nucleotide content (Fig.7 ,E–I).
Finally, we observed that overexpression of the mutated forms of PRS5 on multicopy plasmids only slightly improved suppression compared to that obtained withcentromeric plasmids ( Fig. 7 B).We hypothesized that this could be due to the limitation of one or both of Prs5 partners, AB CD E FG H Figure 6.Growth and metabolic defects of the prs1 prs3 mutant are rescued by supplementation with PRPP-not-requiring precursors.A, addition of nucleoside precursors partially restores the prs1 prs3 mutant growth defect.Wild-type (Y11418) and prs1Δprs3Δ(Y11985) strains were transformed with the hENT1 expressing plasmid (p4991).Transformants were selected on SDcasaW medium supplemented with adenosine (Ado, 300 μM), Uridine (Uri, 300 μM), Tryptophan (300 μM), and Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN, 100 μM).Transformants were serial diluted (1/10) and spotted on SDcasaW supplemented or not with Ado, Uri, Trp, and NMN.

Hence,suppressors of prs1 prs3 most likely act by increasing PRPP synthesis by the Prs2/4/5 enzyme rather than modulating downstream consumption. The results presented in this section and the previous one allow us to conclude that in the prs1 prs3 mutant, PRPP is limiting for proliferation and that these effects can be allevi-ated by increasing PRPP (through PRPS1 ,PRPS2 orPrsA expression or PRS5 suppressors) or by bypassing its require- ment ( via supplementation with nucleosides and amino acids).PRPP is limiting for nucleotide synthesis but not for proliferation in wild-type yeast We then asked whether PRPP is present in excess in yeast cells or whether it could be limiting for nucleotide synthesis even in wild-type cells.To address this question, we ﬁrst expressed in wild-type yeast cells the PRPS1 human enzymethat was able to suppress the growth defect of the prs1 prs3 mutant ( Fig.5 A).
Expression of the human enzyme did not increase intracellular PRPP nor NTPs or NAD(H) in the wild-type cells ( Fig. 8 ,A–F).This result suggested that ribose-5- phosphate, the substrate of PRPP-synthetase, could belimiting for the reaction to proceed or, alternatively, that thehuman enzyme is feedback inhibited by some end-product(s) (16).To settle this question, we expressed in yeast two pre- viously described hyperactive variants of PRPS1 (V142L andA190V) ( 28).Clearly, the expression of these two PRPS1 mutants resulted in a very signi ﬁcant increase of intracellular PRPP ( Fig.8 A) as well as of all NTPs and NAD(H) when expressed in wild-type yeast ( Fig.8 ,B–F).We conclude that PRPP-synthetase activity, rather than the ribose-5-phosphatesubstrate, is limiting PRPP synthesis and downstream re- actions in a wild-type prototroph yeast strain.Furthermore, the expression of these hyperactive forms of PRPP-synthetasesigniﬁcantly affected the doubling time ( Fig.8 G).
Of note, the accumulation of purine intermediates, such as SZMP, IMP andinosine ( Fig. 8 ,H–J) when the PRPS1 mutants are expressed in yeast, indicates that the ﬂux in the purine de novo pathway is overloaded.This metabolic burden could be responsible forthe higher doubling time by diverting a signi ﬁcant part of AB C D E FG H IJ Figure 8.PRPP and nucleotide content is increased by the expression of human PRPS1 hyperactive variants.A–J,the wild-type strain (Y12599) was transformed with an empty vector (p2714) or plasmids expressing the PRPS1 gene either wild-type (p5949) or hyperactive mutants (P5994; p5995).Transformants were exponentially grown for 24 h in SDcasaWA liquid medium before metabolite extraction and quanti ﬁcation.Each metabolite was quanti ﬁed on at least ﬁve independent cultures.Numbers correspond to the p-values calculated from Welch ’s unpaired ttest.PRPP synthesis and utilization in yeast and human 10 J.Biol.Chem.
(2023) 299(8) 105011 glucose from glycolysis to the PPP and nucleotide synthesis in the form of an unused excess of purines. The increase in all NTPs and NAD(H) in yeast strains expressing the two PRPS1 mutants ( Fig.8 ,B–F) suggested that, in wild-type yeast cells, PRPP-utilizing enzymes compete forPRPP as a limiting substrate.To address this question moredirectly, we asked whether affecting one PRPP-consuming pathway results in an effect on the products of other PRPP- consuming pathways.This was ﬁrst done by blocking de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides, using a ade4 knockout mutation that blocks the ﬁrst step of the pathway ( Fig.9 ,AandB).This mutant strain can grow and proliferate as long as it is fed with apurine precursor such as adenine, utilizable through the salvagepathway.When shifted for 3 h in a medium lacking adenine, theade4 mutant showed a strong decrease of adenylic and guanylicnucleotides ( Fig.9 ,Dand E) as expected but also CTP and NAD(H) ( Fig.
9 ,FandG), most probably because their synthesis is affected at low ATP concentration ( 29,30). By contrast to CTP, intracellular UTP showed a strong increase, about four-fold, in the ade4 mutant ( Fig.9 H), suggesting that the PRPP that was not used for purine, CTP, and pyridine synthesis due to theade4 block in the purine pathway could be used to make more UTP.In addition, the expression of an ADE4 hyperactive dominant allele ( Fig.9 ,AandC)(31,32) resulted in decreased intracellular UTP and CTP ( Fig.9 ,IandJ).Of note, here UTP and CTP both decreased re ﬂecting the fact that under these experimental conditions, CTP is synthesized de novo from UTP.In the same experiment, ATP and GTP were not signi ﬁcantly affected ( Fig.9 ,KandL), while the ﬂux in the de novo purine pathway was high as attested by the accumulation of the A B CD G KE H LF I MJ N Figure 9.Impairment of PRPP utilization viathe purine de novo pathway reveals that PRPP is limiting for nucleotide synthesis.
A,B, and D–H, Wild- type (FY4) and ade4Δ(Y12258) yeast strains were exponentially grown for 24 h in SDcasaWAU liquid medium. Cells were then harvested by ﬁltration and grown for three more hours in SDcasaWU liquid medium supplemented (+) or not ( −) with adenine before metabolite extraction, separation, and quanti ﬁcation.C, and I–N, the wild-type strain (Y11418) was transformed with an empty vector (pCM189) or a plasmid carrying the ADE4 hyperactive R328K dominant mutant (p2048).Transformants were exponentially grown for 24 h in SDcasaWA medium before extraction, separation, and quanti ﬁcation of metabolites.D–N, metabolite measurements were performed on four independent cultures and numbers correspond to the p-values calculated from a Welch ’s unpaired ttest.PRPP synthesis and utilization in yeast and human J.Biol.Chem.(2023) 299(8) 105011 11 metabolic intermediate ZMP and of the degradation product inosine ( Fig.9 ,MandN).
These results indicate that the ﬂux in the purine pathway has a strong impact on intracellular UTP.We conclude that, in wild-type yeast, PRPP-utilizing enzymesare competing for PRPP as a substrate which is limiting for thesynthesis of downstream products. This competition between PRPP-utilizing enzymes was further con ﬁrmed using a ura2 block in the pyrimidine pathway (Fig.S3 A).When these cells were grown in the absence of uracil, we observed a severe decrease of UTP and CTP and a small butsigniﬁcant increase of intracellular ATP ( Fig.S3 ,B–F)).Due to the different intracellular abundance of ATP and UTP (3.8 and1.1 mM, respectively.Fig.9 ,AandE) it could be expected that a variation of intracellular ATP would much more severely affectUTP levels than the reverse.
Finally, intracellular NAD(H) was tightly correlated to intracellular ATP as reported before ( 30), and intracellular CTP was correlated to intracellular ATP andUTP which are both required for its synthesis from UTP byCTP-synthase (suggesting that the K Mfor ATP of this enzyme might be high). Altogether, our results allow two conclusions.First, decreasing intracellular PRPP leads to a reduction of alldownstream products, while increasing intracellular PRPP had the opposite effect, establishing that in wild-type yeast cellsPRPP is limiting nucleotide synthesis.Second, when PRPP isover- or under-used in one pathway, it is compensated by itsusage in other PRPP-utilizing pathways, indicating that phos-phoribosyl transferases are competing for PRPP.We concludethat, in yeast, PRPP synthesis limits nucleotide synthesis but not cell proliferation.In addition, PRPP utilization appears to directly result from competition between the enzymes of thedownstream pathways.
Metabolic and proliferation consequences of PRPS hyperactivity in human cells Based on the conclusions obtained with yeast cells, we then questioned several aspects of the PRPP metabolism in human cells. We ﬁrst aimed at evaluating the metabolic consequences of PRPS hyperactivity in the glioblastoma U-87 MG human cell line.PRPS1 (wild-type, and the hyperactive mutants V142L and A190V) or PRPS2 were expressed in U-87 MG cells using lenti- viruses, and metabolic pro ﬁles were established.As in yeast cells, expression of the V142L and A190V PRPS1 mutants in U-87 MG resulted in a signi ﬁcant increase of PRPP ( Fig.10 A)a sw e l la so fa l l AB CD EFG Figure 10.Expression of human PRPS1 hyperactive variants in human cells increases PRPP and nucleotide content and affects cell proliferation.
Lentiviral infection was used to express wild-type human PRPS1 gene (WT, p6033), its two hyperactive mutants (V142L, p6034 and A190V, p6035), or wild- type human PRPS2 gene (PRPS2 WT, p6030) in U-87 MG human cells. Infection with the pLenti-MND-IRES-PuroR-WPRE (p5769) empty vector was used as control.Metabolite content ( A–F) was determined as described in “Experimental Procedures ”and measurements were performed on four independent extractions.In cell proliferation experiments ( G), cells were seeded at the density of 7000 cells/cm2and grown for 4 days in a complete medium before trypsinization and counting.Numbers correspond to the p-values calculated from Welch ’s unpaired ttest.PRPP synthesis and utilization in yeast and human 12 J.Biol.Chem.(2023) 299(8) 105011 NTPs, from 1.6-fold for ATP to more than 2-fold for the other NTPs ( Fig.10 ,B–E) and of 1.2-fold for NAD(H) ( Fig.10 F).
A signiﬁcant increase, although slightly lower, was also observed when these mutant PRPS1 alleles were expressed in the colontumor cell line HCT116 ( Fig. S4 ), indicating that this effect is not cell-line speci ﬁc.Interestingly, expression of wild-type PRPS1 or PRPS2 increased intracellular PRPP in the U-87 MG cell line (Fig.10 A), while such an effect was not observed in the HCT116 cell line ( Fig.S4 A) as well as in yeast cells ( Fig.8 A), the reasons for this discrepancy are not known.However, whilePRPS1 expression had no signi ﬁcant effect on NTPs ( Fig.10 ,B– E)o rN A D ( H )( Fig.10 F), expression of PRPS2 resulted in a sig- niﬁcant increase of all four NTPs and NAD(H) ( Fig.10 ,B–F).In all experiments, cell proliferation was not accelerated by conditions resulting in hig her intracellular NTP content (Fig.10 G), indicating that, as observed in yeast, PRPP is limiting for nucleotide synthesis but not for cell prolifera-tion.
Actually, in all cases where intracellular NTPs werehigh, cell proliferation was severely slowed down ( Fig. 10 G), indicating that more NTPs is not “better ”for human cells, although the precise reasons for this inhibitory effect are notknown.We then investigated whether increasing the ﬂux in one PRPP consumption pathway affects the others, as observed inyeast cells.This was done by growing the HCT116 or U-87 MG cells in dialyzed serum supplemented or not withadenine, which combined with PRPP can be metabolized toAMP by adenine phosphoribosyl transferase and then to ATP.The addition of adenine indeed increased intracellular ATP(Fig.11 ,AandE) and conjointly decreased all other triphos- phate nucleotides ( Fig.11 ,B–DandF–H), suggesting that the PRPP utilized to synthesize ATP from adenine in excess, is limiting the synthesis of other PRPP derived metabolites.Weconclude that PRPP utilization in human cells ( Figs.10 and 11), similar to what was obtained in yeast ( Fig.
9 ), is the direct result of a competition between several downstream pathways. Discussion Our work on PRPP synthesis and consumption in yeast gives important clues on upstream and downstream path-ways.In particular, it allowed us to establish that ribose-5-phosphate synthesis by Rki1 is essential because of the roleof ribose-5-phosphate in PRPP synthesis.Interestingly, this indicates that the alternative synthesis of ribose-5-phosphate from G3P and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate cannot fullycompensate for the loss of Rki1 activity to support the growthof yeast cells ( Fig.1 ).AB C D EF GH Figure 11.Addition of a purine precursor reveals that PRPP is limiting for synthesis of nucleotides in human cells.The human HCT116 ( A–D) and U-87 MG ( E–H) cell lines were seeded in 6-well plates and grown up to half-con ﬂuency in the complete medium.
Cells were then washed and incubated for 2 h in DMEM without serum, and incubated for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% dialyzed serum supplemented (+) or not ( −) with 50 μM adenine. Nucleotides content was determined from 3 ( A–D)t o5( E–H) independent extractions and numbers correspond to the p-values calculated from a Welch ’s unpaired ttest.PRPP synthesis and utilization in yeast and human J.Biol.Chem.(2023) 299(8) 105011 13 Clearly, PRPS1 hyperactive mutants expressed in yeast or human cells increase both intracellular PRPP and down-stream products such as nucleotides.These results establishthat ribose-5-phosphate, just upstream of PRPP synthesis inthe PPP ( Fig.1 ), is not limiting for PRPP synthesis.From these experiments, we propose that ribose-5-phosphate isalways in excess and that the portion not used for PRPP synthesis is recycled in the glycolysis.Accordingly, experi- ments with wild-type PRPS1 suggest that PRPP synthesis islimited by PRPP synthetase regulation.
Indeed, by contrast tothe hyperactive mutant forms of PRPS1, expression of wild-type PRPS1 has no effect on the concentration of PRPP(except in the U-87 MG cell line Fig. 10 ), and no effect either on intracellular nucleotides ( Figs.8 ,B–F,10,B–F,a n d S4,B– F).Importantly, the overproduction of PRPP decreased the proliferation of both the human cells ( Figs.10 GandS4G)a n d the yeast cells ( Fig.8 G).The reason for this defect is not established, but it could re ﬂect the metabolic burden associ- ated with the production of PRPP, and most importantlynucleotides, that are not further used for growth but degradedand excreted in the form of inosine in yeast and uric acid inhumans.Additionally, our results in yeast show that PRPP is syn- thesized at the minimal ﬂow allowing maximal biomass pro- duction.Slightly decreasing PRPP concentration ( prs2 prs4 prs5 triple mutant, Fig.2 A) results in a lower biomass pro- duction rate ( Fig.2 C), while doubling time is not affected (Fig.
2 E), indicating that in this condition, maintaining the doubling time is preferred over maintaining cell size. However,further decreasing intracellular PRPP ( prs1 prs3 ) double mutant ( Fig.2 A) affected both biomass production rate (Fig.2 C) and population doubling time ( Fig.2 E).Strikingly, overexpression of PRS1/PRS3 resulting in increased PRPP concentration also diminished the biomass production rateand increased doubling time ( Fig.4 ,Fand H).These results parallel the fact that both gain and loss of function, in PRPS1,are associated with human diseases ( 18).We interpret these results as an indication that, under standard conditions inwild-type yeast, the PRPP concentration is optimal for growth and division and that an increase or decrease of PRPP syn- thesis capacity affects these parameters (with doubling timetaking precedence over cell volume when PRPP is only slightlylimiting, see Fig.2 ).
These results ﬁt well with the central role of PPP in anabolism and with the key role of PRPP as aproduct of PPP. Most importantly, PRPP consumption, in yeast and human cells, appears to take place “on demand ”by the various PRPP-utilizing pathways.This was shown by blocking or increasing the ﬂux in speci ﬁc PRPP-consuming metabolic routes ( Figs.9 ,11and S3).The results show that there is apparently no regulation of the utilization of PRPP betweenthe various pathways using it, just competition for a common substrate.Together, our results show that PRPP metabolism responds to an action mass law where the ribose-5-phosphate provided by the PPP is not limiting for PRPP synthesis and where PRPP utilization is an on-demand process depending most probablyon the amount and kinetic parameters of the various involved PRPP-utilizing enzymes.
Experimental procedures Yeast media and strains SD is a synthetic minimal medium containing 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 2% glucose. SDcasaW is an SD medium supplemented with 0.2%casamino acids (Difco) and tryptophan (0.2 mM).Whenindicated, adenine (0.3 mM) and/or uracil (0.3 mM) wereadded to SDcasaW medium, resulting in a medium namedSDcasaWA (+adenine), SDcasaWU (+uracil) and SDcasaWAU(+ adenine + uracil).SC -Ura -Leu medium is SC mediumsupplemented with adenine (0.3 mM), histidine (0.06 mM), lysine (0.06 mM), and tryptophan (0.2 mM).The YPD medium contained 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose.Yeastcells were grown in liquid or solid media at 30 /C14C.Yeast strains (listed in Table S2 ) belong to, or are derived from, FY4 and FY5 prototrophic strains ( 33) or disrupted strains isogenic to BY4741 or BY4742 purchased from Euroscarf (Frankfurt,Germany).
Multi-mutant strains were obtained by crossing,sporulation, and micromanipulation of meiosis progeny. Human cell culture, viral infection, and proliferation assays The human tumor cell lines HCT116 (CCL-247) and U- 87 MG (HTB-14) were obtained from the ATCC.Cells weregrown at 37 /C14C, 5% CO 2in a complete DMEM medium containing 4.5 g/L glucose and supplemented with 10% fetalbovine serum (FBS; DUTSCHER #S1810), L-glutamine, peni-cillin, and streptomycin.Dialyzed serum (same FBS as above) was obtained after dialysis in PBS (3 kDa-molecular weight cutoff) and was ﬁltered at 0.1 μm.Lentiviruses expressing PRPS1 ,PRPS2 , and mutants were obtained at the Vect ’UB platform (TBMCore Bordeaux University, see Table S3 ).Titers were given in Transduction Units (TU) and were obtained byqPCR.Cells in suspension in culture medium were incubatedwith lentiviruses at 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 TU/cell and theninoculated at the cell density of 10,000 cells/cm 2in 6-well culture dishes.
Cells were allowed to settle down at 37/C14C for 24 h and 0.5 μg/ml puromycin was then added for 7 days with a medium change every 2 days. TU values retained for thefollowing analyses were in the range of 5 to 20 depending onthe cell type and transduction experiment.Transduction withthe different constructs were performed in paralleled experi-ments, for the sake of better comparisons.Two independentproductions of lentivirus were used and gave similar results.For metabolites quanti ﬁcations, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown up to half con ﬂuency.Cells were then washed and incubated for 24 h in the complete medium beforemetabolic extractions were performed as described in ( 34).Tri-, tetra- or penta-plicate conditions were used.For prolif-eration experiments, cells were seeded in 24-well plates at7000 cells/cm 2and grown for 4 days at 37/C14C with medium changes every 2 days.Triplicate or tetraplicate conditions were used.
Cells were harvested by trypsinization and were counted using a Multisizer four Coulter counter (Beckman).PRPP synthesis and utilization in yeast and human 14 J. Biol.Chem.(2023) 299(8) 105011 Plasmids All plasmids and oligonucleotides are listed in Tables S3 and S4, respectively.Plasmids allowing expression of human wild- type PRPS1 and PRPS2 in yeast were obtained by PCR ampli ﬁcation of the open reading frames (ORF) with the following pairs of oligonucleotides (5562 + 5563 for PRPS1 and 5763 + 5764 for PRPS2 ) using, respectively, cDNA IRAUp969H0616D and IRCMp5012H0142D from Source Biosciences as templates.PRPS1 Hyperactive mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis.PCR products werecloned in the pCM189 or its derivative p2714 plasmids inwhich gene expression is under the control of tetracycline-repressible promoter.
For expression of the same genes inmammalian cells, ORF were ampli ﬁed with the 5678 + 5563 (PRPS1 ) and 5763 + 5764 ( PRPS2 ) and cloned in the pLenti- MND-IRES-Puro R-WPRE. The PrsA expression plasmid was obtained by PCR ampli ﬁcation of PrsA ORF with oligonucle- otides 2278 + 2279 on E.coli genomic DNA as a template and cloning in pCM189.The h ENT1 encoding plasmid was a generous gift from Drs.Cass, Damaraju, and Sawyer.Theplasmid expressing the hyperactive form of ADE4 gene ( ADE4- 1mutant R328K) was obtained by cloning in pCM189 the PCR fragment ampli ﬁed with oligonucleotides 48 + 429 on genomic DNA of the m131 ADE4 mutant described in ( 31,32).
All plasmids used to express PRS1 ,PRS2 ,PRS3 ,PRS4 , and PRS5 (either wild-type or mutated alleles) genes were obtained byPCR ampli ﬁcation of ORFs using yeast genomic DNA as template (FY4 for wild-type genes and PRS5 suppressors indicated in Table S1 ) and the following couples of oligonu- cleotides 2032 + 2033, 5847 + 5848, 5082 + 5083, 5849 + 5850and 2040 + 2041 for PRS1 ,PRS2 ,PRS3 ,PRS4 , and PRS5 , respectively. PCR products were then clones in either centromeric (YCplac33) or multicopy (Yeplac181 orYeplac195) plasmids as indicated in Table S3 .For all plasmids, further construction details are available upon request.Yeast population doubling time Cells were kept in exponential growing phase ( <1.5 10 7cells/ml) for at least 24 h hours by successive dilutions before any measurement.Population doubling time was thendetermined by following cell number during 8 h on at leastfour independent exponential growth culture using the Mul-tisizer four Coulter counter (Beckman).
Population doubling time was then determined by exponential growth regression of the proliferation curves using GraphPad Prism 5. Biomass production rate Cells were exponentially ( <1.5 10 7cells/ml) grown in indicated medium for at least 24 h hours before measurement.Biomass was determined by ﬁltration of aliquots of the cell culture (starting at comparable biomass for each strain around10 mg corresponding to 50 –100 ml at 1 –2×1 0 6cells/ml) on 0.45 μm polyamid pre-weighted ﬁlters (25006 –47-N; Sarto- rius) followed by two 10 ml washes with room temperature milliQ water and drying of the ﬁlter with successive 30 s cycles (until the mass of ﬁlter + cells is constant) in a microwave ovenat 800 W.Dried biomass was measured in exponential growth conditions during 4 h and exponential biomass productionrate was determined by linear regression of the experimentalpoints (see Fig.S5 as an example).
Metabolic analyses Metabolic extractions of yeast or mammalian cells were performed using the EtOH boiling methodology as described in (34). Metabolite separation by ionic chromatography was either performed on an ICS3000 chromatography station (Dionex,Sunnyvale, CA) using a CarboPac PA1 column (250 × 2 mm;Dionex) as described in ( 35), or using the Integrion chroma- tography station (Thermo Electron) equipped with RFIC eluantgenerator and eluant suppressor (ADRS 600) and coupled toboth a Vanquish diode array detector and a conductivity de- tector.Metabolites separation was achieved at 0.38 ml/min and 30 /C14C on an AS11-HC-4 μm (250 × 2 mm, Thermo Electron) with a Potassium hydroxide discontinuous gradient, providedby the eluant generator, starting at 1 mM for 7 min, rising up to15 mM in 9 min, 30 mM in 9 min and 60 mM in 13 min,followed by a step at 60 mM for 7 min and ﬁnally increasing up to 80 mM in 8 min and stay at 80 mM for 29 min.
The resinwas then re-equilibrated at 1 mM KOH for 10 min before in- jection of a new sample. Metabolites were detected by con- ductimetry (PRPP) and by UV absorbance (nucleotides andderivatives) and identi ﬁed by their UV spectrum signature and/ or by injection with standards.For each yeast strain or humancell line, sample normalization was achieved based on cellnumber and median cell volume using a Multisizer 4 (BeckmanCoulter).Peak area quanti ﬁcation was done on conductimetric recording for PRPP and with UV absorbance at 260 nm for all nucleotides and derivatives except for Cytidylic nucleotides and NADH which were quanti ﬁed at 280 nm et 340 nm, respec- tively.The intracellular concentration of metabolites has beendetermined using standard curves obtained with pure com-pounds.The sum of each type of purine (Adenylic and Gua-nylic) and pyrimidine (Uridylic and Cytidylic) nucleotides isdeﬁned as [NXP] = [NMP] + [NDP] + [NTP].All metabolic raw data are presented in Tables S5 –S17.
Statistical analyses For yeast strains and/or human cell lines, growth and me- tabolites extraction were performed on three to eight biolog-ically independent samples, as detailed in each ﬁgure legend. Statistics, given as p-values noted in each ﬁgure, were deter- mined by Welch ’s unpaired ttest.Welch ’sttest is more robust than Student ’sttest and maintains type I error (rejection of the true null hypothesis) rates close to nominal for unequal variances.Data availability All data are contained within the manuscript.Supporting information —This article contains supporting informa- tion ( 36, 37 ).PRPP synthesis and utilization in yeast and human J.Biol.Chem.(2023) 299(8) 105011 15 Acknowledgments —The authors thanks L.Karembé, F.Magendie and K.Zimmerman for their technical assistance, the Vect ’UB and SAM facilities from TBMCore (Bordeaux University, CNRS UAR3427, INSERM US005) for lentiviral vectors and virus production and for metabolic analyses, respectively.
