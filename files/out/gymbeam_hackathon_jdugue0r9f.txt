SHORT COMMUNICATION An early-postmortem metabolic comparison among three extreme acute heat stress temperature settings in chicken breast muscle Mingyue Zhang1•Chaoyu Zhai1,2•Xin Luo1•Hai Lin3•Minghao Zhang1• Lixian Zhu1•Mahesh N.Nair2•Dong U.Ahn4•Rongrong Liang1 Revised: 11 June 2021 / Accepted: 6 August 2021 / Published online: 14 August 2021 /C211Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India) 2021 Abstract Normally, preslaughter acute heat stress could accelerate postmortem glycolysis and impair chicken breast ( pectoralis major muscle) quality.However, previ- ous studies indicated that it might be different when the acute heat stress temperature rises to an extreme range (above 35 /C176C).
Therefore, this study’s objectives were to compare the pH decline, glycolytic enzyme activity, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation at early postmortem among three extreme acute heat stresstemperature settings: a control group (36 /C176C) and two experimental groups (38 /C176C and 40 /C176C). Although the temperature did not affect glycogen phosphorylase a andpyruvate kinase activity, there was a decrease in pH decline rate, phosphofructokinase-1 activity, and phospho-AMPK- a[Thr172] within 4 h postmortem when temperature increased from 36 to 40 /C176C.Temperature also affected hexokinase activity, with the 36 /C176C-group having the highest activity.The results of the current study, for theﬁrst time, indicated that postmortem metabolic rate in chicken breast muscle could be changed by acute heat stress temperature setting at extreme range.
Keywords Chicken /C1Pectoralis major /C1Acute heat stress /C1 AMPK /C1Glycolysis Introduction Pale, soft, and exudative (PSE) meat is a quality defect associated with abnormally light color, soft texture, and poor water holding capacity (WHC) that has become one ofthe biggest challenges to the poultry industry worldwide (Petracci et al. 2009 ; Owens et al.2009 ; Zhu et al.2012 ).The conversion of muscle to meat is a short periodaccompanied by severe changes in metabolism, which can be affected by preslaughter stress, like environment tem- perature, transport, fasting, and stunning (Matarneh et al.2017 ).Rapid glycolysis and pH decline during the early postmortem period is considered to be one of the major reasons for PSE meat (England et al.2014 ).AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy status sensor of maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Garcia and Shaw 2017 ) and is a mediator of the pro- teotoxic stress response (Su and Dai 2016 ).
AMPK can be activated by the increased AMP concentration or elevatedfree calcium concentration (Garcia and Shaw 2017 ), and further achieve its maximal activity by the phosphorylation of the Threonine 172 in AMPK asubunit (p-AMPK- a[Thr172]) (Hawley et al. 1996 ).Previous studies have indicated that an increased p-AMPK- a[Thr172] at early postmortem is associated with rapid postmortem glycolysisand pH decline, which can lead to meat quality defects (Xing et al.2015 ,2016b ; Jiang et al.2016 ).Mingyue Zhang and Chaoyu Zhai have contributed equally to this work.

A day with daily maximum temperature above 35 /C176Ci s normally considered as an extreme heat event in climateresearch, which has been projected to be more intense and frequent worldwide (Collins et al.
2000 ; Ding et al. 2010 ; Twardosz and Kossowska-Cezak 2013 ; Raymond et al.2020 ; Christidis et al.2020 ).Therefore, heat stress has become one of the major challenges to animal production during the summer in the warmer parts of the world (Nardone et al.2010 ).The PSE could be caused by heat stress in chicken (Wang et al.2017b ), probably due to the altered metabo- lism, acid/base status, oxidative reactions, and hormonal secretions (Zaboli et al.2019 ).Although several studies have examined the inﬂuence of acute heat stress (AHS) ranging from 32 to 41 /C176C on chicken breast quality (Northcutt et al.1994 ; Sandercock et al.2001 ; Wang et al.2009 ,2017b ; Tang et al.2013 ; Hu et al.2016 ), inconsistent results were observed when the extreme AHS temperature ranged from 36 to 41 /C176C (Northcutt et al.1994 ; Wang et al.2009 ,2017b ; Tang et al.2013 ).
Meat quality, such as cooking loss, color attributes, and WHC in the chicken breast were impaired by one-hour AHS at 36 /C176C and 37 /C176C (Tang et al. 2013 ; Wang et al.2017b ) but not at 40 /C176C and 41/C176C (Northcutt et al.1994 ; Wang et al.2009 ).Our recent study also indicated that poultry breast meat quality was affected by AHS of 36 /C176C, but the quality defects were reduced as AHS temperatures raised from 36 to 40 /C176C (Zhang et al.2018 ).One possible explanation for this meat quality variation with different AHS temperatures could be the change of postmortem muscle metabolism.However, the biochemical basis of this variation is notclear.To the best of our knowledge, previous studies focused on the comparison between room temperature and AHS temperature settings, and the early postmortemmetabolic difference among extreme AHS temperature settings has not been investigated yet.
Therefore, the objectives of this study were to compare the pH decline,glycolytic enzyme activity, and p-AMPK- a[Thr172] at early postmortem among three extreme AHS temperature settings: 36 /C176C (control), 38 /C176C, and 40 /C176C. Materials and methods Animal treatment and sampling One-hundred male broilers (from Arbor Acres) were raised under similar conditions (25 /C176C±1/C176C, RH 58% *62%) for the ﬁrst six weeks.Twenty-four broilers with similarweight (2.32 ±0.02 kg) were selected and eight broilers each (n = 8) were randomly assigned to either (1) 36 /C176C(control), (2) 38 /C176C, or (3) 40 /C176C heat stress for 90 min.All 24 broilers were moved to a preparation room (25 /C176C) and caged individually for 24 h before the AHS for adaption.After the adaptation, the broilers were moved into a heatexposure room where treatments were applied.All cage positions in the heat exposure room were the same as in the preparation room, and water was offered throughout thetreatment.
After 90-min exposure, each broiler was moved out and then slaughtered and bled within ﬁve minutes. After exsanguination, boneless pectoralis major (PM) muscle from both sides of the bird was removed immediately,without scalding or defeathering, and stored at 4 /C176C for aging.Sample (2 g) was collected from each side of PM muscle at 0.1 h, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h postmortem for enzymeanalysis (left side) and pH measurement (right side).An additional sample from the right breast muscle was col- lected at 24 h postmortem for the ultimate pH measure-ment.The collected samples were ﬁrstly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80/C176C until analysis.Muscle pH value The pH values of the right breast muscles were measured, according to Wang et al.( 2017b ).One-gram muscle sam- ple was homogenized in 9 mL of 5 mM iodoacetate solu- tion for 60 s by a blender (IKA, T18, Staufen, Germany) atmedium speed.
Three repetitions were measured by a pH meter (SevenGo, Mettler Toledo, Zurich, Switzerland). Enzyme activity measurement Protein concentration (Cpr) was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (BCAP-2-W, Suzhou Comin Biotechnol- ogy, China).The activity of enzyme glycogen phosphory- lase a (GPa) was measured because GPa is typically moreactive than glycogen phosphorylase b, and the latter form can be converted to GPa by phosphorylation (Barford and Johnson 1989 ) or calcium activation (Meyer et al.1964 ).The GPa activity was estimated spectrophotometrically using a GPa assay kit (GPA-2-Y, Suzhou Comin Biotechnology, China).Sample (100 mg) was homoge-nized in 1 mL extraction solution.After centrifugation (8,000 9ga t4 /C176C, 10 min), 10 lL of the supernatant was mixed with 10 lL distilled water and 180 lL reaction mixture in a microvolume quartz cuvette and held at 37 /C176C.The absorbance values at 340 nm were recorded after 5 min (A1) and 10 min (A2).
The activity of GPa wascalculated as (643 9(A2-A1))/Cpr. Hexokinase (HK) activity was determined spectrophotometrically with a hexokinase assay kit (HK-2-Y, Suzhou Comin Biotech-nology, China).Sample (100 mg) was homogenized in 1 mL extraction solution.After centrifugation (8000 9g4824 J Food Sci Technol (December 2021) 58(12):4823–4829 123 at 4/C176C, 10 min), 30 lL of the supernatant was mixed with 1008lL reaction mixture in a quartz cuvette and held at 37/C176C.The absorbance values at 340 nm were recorded after 20 s (A1) and 5 min 20 s (A2).The activity of HKwas calculated as (1113 9(A1-A2))/Cpr.Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) activity was determined spectrophotometrically with a PFK1 assay kit (PFK-2-Y,Suzhou Comin Biotechnology, China).Sample (100 mg) was homogenized in 1 mL extraction solution.After cen- trifugation (8000 9ga t4 /C176C, 10 min), 30 lL of the supernatant was mixed with 810 lL reaction mixture in a quartz cuvette and held at 37 /C176C.
The absorbance values at 340 nm were recorded after 20 s (A1) and 10 min 20 s (A2). The activity of PFK1 was calculated as (450 9(A1- A2))/Cpr.Pyruvate kinase (PK) activity was determinedspectrophotometrically with a PK assay kit (PK-2-Y, Suzhou Comin Biotechnology, China).Sample (100 mg) was homogenized in 1 mL extraction solution.After cen-trifugation (8000 9ga t4 /C176C, 10 min), 50 lL of the supernatant was mixed with 950 lL reaction mixture in a quartz cuvette and held at 37 /C176C.The absorbance values at 340 nm were recorded after 20 s (A1) and 2 min 20 s (A2), respectively.The activity of PK was calculated as (2613 9(A1-A2))/Cpr.Immunoblot analysis for p-AMPK- a[Thr172] The determination of p-AMPK- a[Thr172] was evaluated in 30lg of protein extracts of muscle sample as described previously (Xing et al.2016b ).
Primary antibodies, phos- pho-AMPK- a[Thr172] antibody (Cell Signaling Technol- ogy, MA, USA), and monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody (Bio-world,MO, USA), were used at 1:1000 and 1:10,000 dilution, respectively. The secondary antibody was from Jackson (West Grove, PA, USA).Band density of p-AMPK-a[Thr172] was normalized to the density of GAPDH for loading control.Statistical analysis A split-plot design was used to evaluate the effects of extreme AHS temperature and postmortem-time on muscle pH, glycolytic enzyme activity, and p-AMPK- a[Thr172].Samples were assigned to temperature 9postmortem-time combinations.Data analysis was performed by R (version 3.6.1) using the lme4 package as a mixed model, where temperature, postmortem-time, and their interactions wereﬁxed effects, and the random effect was the individual bird.
Differences between least-square means ( P\0.05) were determined by Tukey’s multiple comparisons.Results and discussion Muscle pH A temperature 9postmortem-time interaction ( P\0.05) was observed for muscle pH (Fig. 1).All temperature groups had the same muscle pH at 0.1 h postmortem (P[0.05), then the pH in the 36 /C176C-group rapidly dropped from 0.1 to 1 h postmortem and had a lower pH than other groups at 1 h and 2 h postmortem ( P\0.05).However, no difference was observed in pH among different groups at 4and 24 h postmortem ( P[0.05).A similar pH decline and ultimate pH values after AHS have been reported before (Wang et al.2009 ,2017b ; Zhang et al.2018 ).This indi- cated that the increase of AHS temperature from 36 to 40/C176C caused a slower pH decline at early postmortem.Glycolytic enzyme activity The main effect of postmortem-time ( P\0.05) was observed for GPa activity, with the activity decreasing from 0.1 to 4 h (Fig.
2a), which is in agreement with previous observation in postmortem muscle (England et al. 2014 ; Li et al.2017 ), possibly due to the pH decline from the optimum environmental pH (6.8) for GPa activity(Kasvinsky and Meyer 1977 ).No temperature effect for GPa activity was observed ( P[0.05).In addition, the main effect of temperature ( P\0.05) was observed for HK activity (Fig.2b), with the control group (36 /C176C) having the highest activity within 4 h postmortem.More- over, the HK activity was inﬂuenced ( P\0.05) by post- mortem-time, with the activity increasing from 0.1 to 2 h postmortem, followed by a decrease from 2 to 4 h post- mortem.Li et al.( 2017 ) also reported a similar trend of HK activity in postmortem muscle, which could be explained by the high activity of HK around pH 6.0 (Souza et al.2002 ).Temperature and postmortem-time affected PFK1 activity without interaction ( P\0.05; Fig.2c).
The PFK1 activity decreased as temperature increased from 36 to40/C176C(P\0.05), and its activity decreased as time post- mortem increased ( P\0.05). A similar temperature effect (from 33 to 42 /C176 C) was also observed in an in vitro system (England et al.2014 ).The PK activity was inﬂuenced by postmortem-time ( P\0.05) but not temperature (P[0.05; Fig.2d), with a decrease in PK activity from 1 to 4 h postmortem, which could be attributed to the pH decline further from its optimum pH at mildly alkaline range (Brown et al.1985 ).J Food Sci Technol (December 2021) 58(12):4823–4829 4825 123 AMPK phosphorylation Temperature inﬂuenced ( P\0.05) the amount of p-AMPK- a[Thr172], with a decrease in phosphorylation as temperature increased (Fig.3).A temperature effect on AMPK activity in postmortem muscle was also found in an in vitro study (Strobel et al.2021 ).
In addition, the post- mortem-time inﬂuenced ( P\0.05) the p-AMPK- a[Thr172], with an increase from 0.1 to 1 h postmortem and a decrease from 1 to 2 h postmortem. In agreement, previous studies also reported a similar trend of p-AMPK-a[Thr172] and AMPK activity in postmortem muscle (Shen et al.2006a ,b; Jiang et al.2016 ).During muscle-to-meat conversion, mitochondria will lose integrity and commit apoptotic cell death by the for- mation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore in postmortem muscle (Wang et al.2017a ), which will dis- sociate mitochondrial F 1-ATPase from the F 0domain and further promote ATP hydrolysis and pH decline (Matarneh et al.2018 ).Meanwhile, more AMP will be generated by adenylate kinase catalyzing ADP, which can activate AMPK (Garcia and Shaw 2017 ) and PFK1 activity (Chauhan et al.2021 ).
However, a proteotoxic stress response can be mobilized by extreme heat stress, which can activate heat shock factor 1 to increase the expressionof heat shock proteins (Su and Dai 2016 ), a set of proteins that can protect muscle cell from calcium overload, cell death signaling, and proteolysis and eventually preservemeat quality (Xing et al. 2019 ).In chicken PM muscle, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), a member of the heat shock proteins, will increase its expression more than three timesafter 40 /C176C heat stress (Hao and Gu 2014 ).The increased Hsp70 can protect mitochondria from stressed-induced apoptosis (Roufayel and Kadry 2019 ), which could slow down ATP hydrolysis, pH decline, and AMP generation as well as decrease PFK1 activity and p-AMPK- a[Thr172].In support, a previous study observed less mitochondrialdamage, higher muscle ﬁber integrity, and better meat quality as AHS temperature increased from 36 to 40 /C176C (Zhang et al.2018 ).
Moreover, some studies found that Hsp70 can directly interact with PFK1 in chicken PM muscle during at early postmortem (Xing et al. 2016a ) and have a negative correlation with p-AMPK- a[Thr172] (Xing et al.2015 ).Therefore, the current observation of slower pH decline decreased PFK1 activity, and lower p-AMPK- a[Thr172] as AHS temperature increased from 36 to 40 /C176C could be attributed to the stimulated proteotoxic stress response in chicken PM muscle during the early post- mortem.However, further research is necessary to verifythe current hypothesis.Fig.1 Effect of extreme acute heat stress temperature and post- mortem time on pH decline (n = 8) in chicken pectoralis major muscle.The least-square means for the pH of different temperaturegroups at the same postmortem time without a common letter (x–y)differ ( P\0.05).The least-square means for the pH of the same temperature group at different postmortem times without a common letter (a-c) differ ( P\0.05).

Effect of extreme acute heat stress temperature and postmortem time on glycolytic enzyme activity (n = 8) in chicken pectoralis major muscle. For each enzyme, the least square means for the enzyme activity of different temperature groups at the samepostmortem time without a common letter (x–y) differ ( P\0.05).The least-square means for the enzyme activity of the sametemperature group at different postmortem times without a common letter (a-c) differ ( P\0.05).The standard error for the activity of each enzyme: GPa = 5.3, HK = 9.51, PFK1 = 5.09, and PK = 0.171.Abbreviations: GPa = glycogen phosphorylase a; HK = hexokinase;PFK1 = phosphofructokinase-1; PK = pyruvate kinase; NS = no signiﬁcanceJ Food Sci Technol (December 2021) 58(12):4823–4829 4827 123 effect is dependent on the temperature setting.A small change in preslaughter environment temperature at extreme temperature range could affect postmortem meat quality.
Inthe context of global warming, research examining heat stress should pay attention to the possible inﬂuence of the differences when the extreme temperature is chosen.
