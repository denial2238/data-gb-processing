202153746 | Received 3August 2021 | Revised 20January 2022 | Accepted 25January 2022 | Published online 24February 2022 EMBO Reports ( 2022 )23:e53746Introduction In healthy humans, skeletal muscle makes up to 40% of the total body mass (Janssen et al, 2000), of which 20% are constituted by proteins. Massive skeletal muscle atrophy is the hallmark of a multi-organ wasting disorder known as cachexia, which causes severeasthenia and intolerance to therapies in patients with chronic dis-eases such as cardiac failure, COPD, and notably cancer, leading topoor clinical outcomes (Fearon et al, 2011; Porporato, 2016).Indeed, the prevalence of cachexia reaches 80% in advanced-stagecancer patients and has been estimated to directly cause at least20% of all cancer-related deaths (Tisdale, 2002).
In cancer cachexia, systemic alterations contribute to the uncon- trollable decrease in quality of life, insulin resistance, liver dysfunc-tion, chronic inflammation, and even altered gut microbiota andnutrient absorption (Porporato, 2016). Remarkably, iron deficiencyis diagnosed in more than half of patients afflicted with colorectal,lung, and pancreatic cancers, which are also associated with highprevalence of cachexia (Ludwig et al, 2013).Chronic inflammation hampers iron absorption from the diet and causes iron retention inreticuloendothelial cells, which results in insufficient iron availabil-ity to meet the body’s needs.Iron is indeed a versatile cofactoressential to a multitude of vital metabolic processes including oxy-gen supply, DNA synthesis, redox homeostasis, or energy metabo-lism.
Energy production directly depends on the availability of iron.It is indispensable for the activity of several mitochondrial enzymesinvolved in the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain, whereiron is found under the form of heme or iron –sulfur cluster (ISC).

Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0license EMBO reports 23:e53746 |2022 1of18 Moreover, iron has been shown to directly regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, highlighting the sensitivity of these organelles to ironavailability (Rensvold et al, 2016).Notably, both iron accumulation and iron deficiency are detrimental to mitochondrial function.Cellu-lar iron homeostasis is thus a tightly regulated process involving abroad variety of proteins responsible for its transport (transferrin),uptake (transferrin receptor/TFR1), storage (ferritin/FT), and export(ferroportin/FPN1).
The fine tuning of intracellular iron metabolismis made possible by the Iron Responsive Element/Iron ResponsiveProtein (IRE/IRP) system exerting a major control on the translationof several key iron-related proteins. In the skeletal muscle, iron is particularly needed to support the high metabolic activity required for ATP generation, a requisite forcontraction and movement.While mitochondrial dysfunction (inparticular, decreased oxidative capacity, inefficient energy produc-tion, and altered mitochondrial dynamics) has been proven to pro-mote skeletal muscle wasting in cachexia (Boengler et al , 2017; Abrigo et al, 2019), little is known about the consequence of altered iron levels on skeletal muscle function and mass.Importantly, irondeficiency is present in the vast majority of cancer patients and hasbeen associated to advanced stage and poor prognosis (Ludwig et al,2013).Hence, we decided to investigate the role of iron metabo- lism in cancer cachexia-related muscle wasting.
Results Iron deficiency induces skeletal muscle atrophy Iron deficiency is highly prevalent in cancer patients and has been associated to advanced stage and poor prognosis (Ludwig et al, 2013). To assess the effects of cancer-induced iron deficiency on skel-etal muscle metabolism, we analyzed the transcript levels of the maincellular iron importer, transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) in a cohort ofcancer patients presenting body weight loss and anemia (Fig 1A andB).During iron deficiency, cells normally increase iron importthrough TFR1 to maintain homeostasis (Camaschella et al, 2020).Surprisingly, the patients displayed decreased TFR1 (Fig 1C).Tosimulate the condition of iron-deficient anemia typical of cancer patients, we induced severe anemia in mice by combined phlebotomyand iron-free diet (Fig EV1A).This treatment resulted in muscle atro-phy (Figs 1D and EV1B), supporting the hypothesis of an involve-ment of iron homeostasis in the onset of cancer-associated musclewasting.
As expected, iron deficiency promoted TFR1 upregulation inliver (Fig 1E), presumably to ensure the necessary supply of iron tothe organ (Camaschella et al, 2020). However, TFR1 was downregu- lated in skeletal muscle of iron-deficient mice (Figs 1F and EV1C),suggesting a different response of this tissue to iron deprivation.Tostudy the role of TFR1 expression on muscle mass, we transfectedTFR1-silencing or TFR1-overexpressing plasmid by electroporatingthe tibialis anterior of healthy mice.TFR1 silencing was sufficient toinduce fiber atrophy (Figs 1G and EV1D), while TFR1 overexpressiontriggered hypertrophy in the positive fibers (Fig 1H).Coherently,inhibition of iron import by silencing TFR1 induced significantmyotube atrophy in vitro and decrease of the labile iron pool (Figs 1I and EV1E and F).
Similarly, blocking intracellular iron mobilizationby silencing NCOA4 (a cytoplasmic protein that mediates autophagicdegradation of ferritin (Bellelli et al, 2016)), also caused significant myotube atrophy (Figs 1J and EV1G). Furthermore, to assess thedirect impact of iron deficiency on muscle, we evaluated the effect ofiron chelation on murine and human myotubes.Treatment with dif-ferent iron chelators, namely deferoxamine (DFO), bathophenanthro-line disulfonic acid (BPS), and apotransferrin (Apo-Tf), which isknown to decrease transferrin saturation, led to a reduction in C2C12myotube diameter and labile iron pool (Figs 1K and EV1H).Consis-tently, iron chelation by DFO exerted the same atrophic effect onhuman myotubes (Figs 1L).In summary, we found that cachecticcancer patients have decreased muscular TFR1 expression, anddecreased iron availability is sufficient to induce skeletal muscle atro-phy in vivo and myotube diameter reduction in vitro .
Altered iron metabolism in the skeletal muscle is a feature of cancer-induced cachexia To confirm the link between cancer cachexia and iron metabolism in the skeletal muscle, we recreated cancer cachexia in mice using ▸Figure 1.

Muscle TFR1 downregulation wasfurther confirmed in two different murine cachexia models, namely, LLC (Lewis Lung Carcinoma) and BaF3 (murine interleukin 3-dependent pro-B cell line) (Fig EV2F –K). Moreover, we assessed iron-sensing RNA-binding proteins mediating post-transcriptionalregulation of iron metabolism in mammalian cells (Meyron-Holtzet al, 2004; Wang et al, 2020).We observed a decrease in cytosolic aconitase activity (hence a switch to iron-regulatory protein/IRP1) A D F HIJGEBC Figure 2.4of18 EMBO reports 23:e53746 |2022 ª2022 The Authors.Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0licenseEMBO reports Elisabeth Wyart et al (Fig 2D), and an upregulation of iron-regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) (Fig 2E), indicating an iron-deficient state in the skeletal muscle oftumor-bearing mice.As IRP activity should drive TFR1 expressionvia iron-responsive element (IRE), we measured the activity of theIRE-IRP system in cachectic muscles by RNA electrophoretic mobil-ity shift assay (REMSA).
Despite the decreased aconitase function ofIRP1 and the overexpression of IRP2, we observed a lower RNA-binding activity to the IRE site of ferritin (FT) in cachectic samplescompared to control in native conditions (Figs 2F and EV2L). Thephenotype appeared to be linked to protein oxidation.Indeed, byperforming the assay in reducing condition, we evidenced the oppo-site pattern, with cachectic samples presenting a higher IRE-binding,suggesting an oxidative damage, which is known to negatively regu-late IRP2 activity (Gehring et al, 1999).The oxidative stress in skele- tal muscle of C26 tumor-bearing mice was further confirmed byupregulated protein carbonylation (Fig 2G).In addition, weobserved an overexpression of FT (Fig 2H), which is in line withimpaired IRP activity (Cairo et al, 1996).Coherently, cachectic mus- cles showed significantly increased protein-chelated iron despite nochange in total iron content (Fig 2I and J).
Cachectic muscles are characterized by mitochondrial iron deficiency and impaired oxidative metabolism In most cells, a major amount of iron is taken up by mitochondria for the production of ISCs and heme. In the skeletal muscle of C26tumor-bearing mice, we found a significant reduction of mitochon-drial iron and total heme content (Fig 3A and B), as well as upregu-lated levels of mitochondrial iron importer mitoferrin 2 (MFRN2)and of the rate-limiting enzyme of heme synthesis aminolevulinicacid synthase 2 (ALAS2) (Fig 3C and D) (Barman-Aksozen et al, 2019).Given that iron is essential for several enzymes involved inthe TCA cycle and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS)(Xu et al, 2013), we assessed the enzymatic activity of two iron –sul- fur proteins, aconitase (ACO) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH),and found a 50% reduction in the activity of both enzymes incachectic muscles (Fig 3E and F).
Along with these alterations, weobserved a drop in mitochondrial ATP (Fig 3G) and increasedAMPK phosphorylation, denoting mitochondrial dysfunction incachectic muscles (Zhao et al, 2016) (Fig 3H). In summary, tumor- bearing mice display remarkable alterations in muscle iron metabo-lism coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction, which has beenlinked to muscle atrophy.Iron supplementation prevents mitochondrial dysfunction and atrophy in vitro In line with the in vivo data, we found considerably decreased mito- chondrial DNA and proteins in myotubes treated with C26 condi-tioned medium (CM) (Fig 4A and B).To verify the hypothesis thatcancer-associated iron shortage could cause mitochondrial dysfunc-tion, a known feature of muscle atrophy (Liu et al, 2016), we supple- mented atrophic C2C12-myotubes with iron.Iron supplementationfully rescued the C26 CM-induced reduction of the oxygen consump-tion rate (OCR) (Fig 4C –F), while showing no effect on control myotubes (Fig EV3A).
Moreover, microscopic analysis confirmed thatiron supplementation prevents C26-induced diameter decreased inboth murine and human myotubes in vitro (Fig 4G and H). Notewor- thy, although iron substantially increases the diameter of C26-treatedmyotubes over time, we observed no change in the fusion index,excluding a potential effect on myogenesis (Fig EV3B and C).Consis-tently with the C26 model, iron supplementation prevented other can-cer CM- and activin A (ActA)-induced atrophy (Zhou et al, 2020) in murine myotubes (Fig EV3D and E).Similarly, normalization of ironlevels using the iron –ionophore hinokitiol (Grillo et al, 2017) also res- cued myotube atrophy induced by TFR1-silencing or C26 CM (FigEV3F and G).Importantly, low-dose rotenone (complex 1 inhibitor)caused a mild atrophy that cannot be rescued by iron, indicating thatthe protective effects of iron are mediated by mitochondrial function(Fig 4I).
Altogether, these data demonstrate that C26 CM treatmentrecapitulates the mitochondrial dysfunction observed in vivo (Fig 3), which can be fully rescued in vitro by iron supplementation. Iron supplementation rescues skeletal muscle mass and mitochondrial function To assess if iron supplementation could prevent cancer-induced muscle atrophy in vivo , C26 tumor-bearing mice were i.v.treated with ferric carboxymaltose (FeCM) every 5 days post C26 injection.Remarkably, intravenous injections of iron resulted in healthier(smooth fur, no orbital discharge, no humpback) and more physi-cally active mice that survived far beyond the usually fatal 2 weeks(Fig 5A and B).Of note, iron improved notably the grip strengthwithin 24 h (Fig EV4A) and the protection was preserved until theend-point of the experiment (Fig 5C), without affecting hematocrit(Fig EV4B).In addition, the loss of body weight and muscle massoccurring at day 12 after C26 injection was prevented in FeCM-◀Figure 2.

The protection from atro-phy was further confirmed by the cross-sectional area (CSA) distri-bution, showing a shift toward bigger areas in FeCM-treated micecompared to C26 tumor-bearing, untreated animals, and the averageCSA (Figs 5G and H, and EV4D and E). These findings were furtherreinforced by a significant drop of FBXO32 (ATRO1), TRIM63 (MURF1), and DDIT4 (REDD1) mRNA levels, which are indicatorsof skeletal muscle atrophy (Fig 5I –K).Iron supplementation refuels mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and energy generation Since our findings in vitro indicate that iron can refuel mitochondrial metabolism and maintain myotube mass, we sought to validate ourhypothesis in vivo .After verifying the replenishment of mitochondrial A E HFGBC D Figure 3.Cachectic muscles are characterized by mitochondrial iron deficiency and impaired oxidative metabolism.A ICP-MS quantification of mitochondrial iron in mouse quadriceps ( n=6–8).

Altogether, these data indicate that iron supplementation of tumor-bearing micemitigates energetic stress and catabolic pathways, which mediate theincrease in muscle functionality and mass. Iron supplementation improves muscle strength in cancer patients Based on the results obtained in the pre-clinical model of cancer- associated muscle wasting, we measured the handgrip force in can-cer patients with severe anemia, who reported muscle weakness,before and after FeCM injection (Table EV1).Improved strengthwas observed in the dominant hand of all patients, while more thanhalf showed also increased force in the non-dominant hand (Fig 7Aand B) as short as 4 §days after the injection.Together with our data reporting TFR1 downregulation in the skeletal muscle of cachecticpatients (Fig 1C), these findings indicate that altered iron metabo-lism may contribute to muscle weakness in cachectic patients.
Con-sequently, these results highlight the contribution of iron on bothmuscle mass and functionality and suggest a new promising thera-peutic strategy to counteract cancer-induced skeletal musclewasting. Altogether, our findings show that iron supplementationprevents cancer-induced cachexia through a recovery of mitochon-drial function (Fig 7C).Discussion Our study indicates iron as a key element of skeletal muscle masshomeostasis through the maintenance of mitochondrial function.Inparticular, we evidenced that cancer causes striking iron dysregula-tion in cachectic muscle, and that muscle wasting is reversible byiron supplementation.Despite being the biggest tissue in the human body, the involvement of skeletal muscle in systemic iron homeosta-sis has been generally neglected.Nevertheless, skeletal muscle holdsa substantial pool of iron that can be mobilized, as demonstrated byits ability to support erythropoiesis in healthy humans during high-altitude hypoxia (Robach et al, 2007).
Since iron deficiency and ane- mia are common in cancer patients (Ludwig et al, 2013) and are associated with several features of cachexia, such as impaired physi-cal function, weakness, and fatigue, we hypothesized a link betweenaltered iron metabolism and muscle wasting. We found that irondeficiency, either cancer-induced or obtained with iron chelators,disrupts iron homeostasis in the skeletal muscle and leads to muscleatrophy in different murine models.Surprisingly, atrophic muscleparadoxically downregulate the iron importer TFR1 despite the lackof iron, highlighting the role of skeletal muscle as an expendablebody compartment.Similarly, we found a consistent decrease ofTFR1 in late-stage anemic cancer cachexia patients while it has alsobeen reported that chemotherapy negatively affects TFR1 levels inthe skeletal muscle (Hulmi et al, 2018).
TFR1 emerges as a direct player in muscle mass homeostasis, as we show that its expressionis sufficient per se to regulate myofiber size in vivo . These data are also supported by previous work on muscle-specific TFR1 KO micewhich displayed severe systemic metabolic dysfunction (Barrientoset al, 2015).Intriguingly, skeletal muscle from C26 tumor-bearing mice combine typical hallmarks of iron deficiency ( i.e., IRP2 upregu- lation, decrease in both cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitase activ-ity, and mitochondrial iron) with the ones of iron overload ( i.e., TFR1 downregulation, increase in ferritin, and in protein-boundiron).Such discrepancy can be explained by the impaired IRE-IRPsystem, due to a significant oxidative damage, which can bereversed by reducing conditions ex vivo (Cairo et al, 1998; Mikhael et al, 2006).Consequently, cachectic muscles sequestrate intracellu- lar iron, downregulate its import despite the need for iron.
This phe-notype matches the observations reported in several IRP2 knockoutmodels (Meyron-Holtz et al, 2004; Galy et al, 2010; Li et al, 2018). To understand whether the resulting inadequate levels of ironimpact muscle fitness, we focused on the in vitro myotube model (both murine and human).Importantly, iron deprivation inmyotubes, induced by TFR1 or NCOA4 knockdown, apotransferrin,DFO, or BPS treatment was sufficient to trigger atrophy, whereasiron replenishment proved to be protective against conditionedmedium-induced atrophy.Thus, we speculated that iron availability◀Figure 4.Iron enhances mitochondrial function and prevents cancer-induced myotube atrophy.A qPCR analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) on nuclear DNA (nDNA) in C 2C12myotubes treated for 48h with C 26CM and ferric citrate ( n=6).B Western blot of mitochondrial OXPHOS respiratory complexes in C 2C12myotubes treated for 48h with C 26CM and ferric citrate ( n=3).

From the mechanistic standpoint, our in vitro data shows that iron supplementation refuels mitochon- drial function. The upregulation of MFRN2 and ALAS2 could beinterpreted as a compensatory response of the skeletal muscle tomitochondrial iron deficiency.In particular, ALAS2 overexpressionhas been associated to muscle weakness and atrophy in transgenicmice (Peng et al, 2021).Indeed, mitochondrial dysfunction has been functionally linked to wasting, both in pathological conditions(Romanello et al, 2010) and aging (Tezze et al, 2017; Palla et al, 2021), while an increasing pool of data associates declined oxidativemetabolism with muscle myopathies (Dziegala et al, 2018).Notably, cardiac iron concentration inversely correlated with disease severityin non-ischemic heart failure patients (Hirsch et al, 2020).
Of note, iron is essential for mitochondrial function (Levi & Rovida, 2009) asit catalyzes several bioenergetic processes and its deprivation causesimpaired mitochondrial biogenesis, enhanced mitophagy as well asmetabolic dysfunction (Allen et al, 2013; Rensvold et al, 2013; Bastian et al, 2019). We specifically found in cachectic mice that reduced mitochon- drial iron content impairs mitochondrial activity and promotesAMPK phosphorylation, reflecting increased catabolism.The oxida-tive stress generated by dysfunctional mitochondria might reinforceiron dysregulation via IRPs inhibition, creating a vicious cycle.Fur-thermore, mitochondrial dysfunction is known to trigger catabolicpathways, notably FAO (Romanello & Sandri, 2015) that has beenwidely associated with skeletal muscle wasting (Brown et al, 2017; Abrigo et al, 2019).
Our results pointed at two major ISC proteins of the TCA cycle and electron transport chain that have stronglyreduced enzymatic activities, aconitase, and SDH, corroboratingwith the decreased oxidative capacities and energetic inefficiency asfeatures of cachexia (Argiles et al, 2014; Neyroud et al, 2019). This confirms and extends studies showing that iron deficiency decreasesISC proteins, cytochrome content, and total oxidative capacity incancer cachexia (Maguire et al, 1982; Oexle et al, 1999; Leermakers et al, 2020).Our data indicate that adequate iron supply restores mitochondrial function, as reflected by ATP production increase,AMPK deactivation, and FAO reduction.Noteworthy, iron-induced muscle protection was independent from tumor growth, as iron supplementation did not alter tumorvolume.
This observation is in line with the fact that C26 tumors donot show iron addiction and respond to iron supplementation bydownregulating the iron-import machinery.Of note, consistent with the in vitro data of rapid mitochondrial metabolism rescue, the beneficial effects of iron injection in vivo were unexpectedly fast as muscle strength was improved within24 h. The rescue is therefore unlikely due to muscle stem cell differ-entiation/regeneration or erythropoiesis.In line with this hypothe-sis, anemia remained after iron supplementation in C26 tumor-bearing mice.Although we found that iron supplementation can restore muscle mass homeostasis, both in vitro and in vivo , we do not exclude other systemic effects of iron repletion, for example liver (Klempa et al,1989) and adipose tissue function (Gao et al, 2015), or immune system modulation (Serra et al, 2020), which might contribute to the increased survival but require further studies.
However, our in vivo electroporation data show that TFR1 levels can directly influ- ence myofiber size in healthy mice, without confounding systemicfactors such as inflammation. Coherently, our preliminary data fromiron-deficient patients demonstrated an improvement of handgripstrength within a few days after iron treatment, excluding the poten-tial involvement of erythropoiesis, while previous data on cardiacfailure patients showed beneficial effects after long-term treatment(Jankowska et al, 2016).Nevertheless, this is a very preliminary study on a limited number of patients who required iron supplemen-tation because of iron-deficiency anemia; hence they lack a placebogroup.Further studies will be essential to better define the impact ofshort-term iron treatment on patients, including a control group, aswell as the impact on blood parameters a few days followingsupplementation.
Our findings corroborate with the assumption that iron defi- ciency causes metabolic dysfunction and energy insufficiency inskeletal muscle (Dziegala et al, 2018). Indeed, both iron deficiency (Leermakers et al, 2020) (Higashida et al, 2020) and iron overload (Alves et al, 2021) are detrimental to muscle physiology.Previous work suggested that excessive iron could underlie muscle loss insarcopenic gastric cancer patients (Zhou et al, 2020).However, our study indicates that the distribution of iron rather than its totalamount influences muscle homeostasis.Notably, we show that thetotal amount of iron is not changed in cachectic muscle compared tohealthy controls in our C26 model, but it is mostly sequestrated inthe cytosol and lacking in the mitochondria.
While we confirmedthe phenotype of altered iron metabolism in several wasting models(related to cancer or not), the beneficial effects of iron supplementa-tion remain to be validated in other cancer models given that somecancer types would rely more on iron than others (Hsu et al, 2020).◀Figure 5.

Therefore, iron supple-mentation restores skeletal muscle homeostasis via mitochondrialmetabolism normalization, paving the way for a new therapeuticstrategy to fight muscle atrophy in cachectic patients, but also innon-cancer conditions presenting iron deficiency as co-morbidity,such as COPD and chronic cardiac failure.Materials and Methods Human skeletal muscle biopsies The study enrolled patients (age >18 years) with pancreatic can- cer surgically treated at the 3rd Surgical Clinic of Padova Univer-sity Hospital. Cancer patients were classified as severely A CB Figure 7.Iron supplementation improves muscle function in iron deficient cancer patients.A, B Grip force of dominant or non-dominant arm in iron-deficient cancer patients, expressed in percentage of baseline force (A) and absolute values n ormalized to height (B) before/after single dose of iron carboxymaltose ( 15mg/kg, 7subjects).
C Working model: C 26tumor-bearing mice present alterations of key iron metabolism proteins such as the downregulation of TFR 1and the upregulation FT in the skeletal muscle. Decreased cytosolic aconitase activity and the stabilization of IRP 2indicate a low iron status.However, IRP activity is hampered by oxidative stress and is no longer able to regulate TFR and FT (indicated by dashed lines).As a consequence, mitochondrial iron loading is low, and the decrease activity of iron- dependent enzymes negatively affect the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain, resulting in decreased ATP production, AMPK activation, and mus cle atrophy.Iron supplementation replenishes the mitochondrial iron pool and prevents mitochondrial dysfunction.Notably, it restores TCA cycle and electron transport chain activity resulting in higher ATP production, deactivation of AMPK, and preserved muscle mass.Data information: For all data, nrepresents the number of biological replicates.

From all patients a blood sample was retrieved prior toany surgical manipulation and the biopsies were performed duringelective surgery within 30 min of the start of the surgery by coldsection of a rectus abdominal fragment of about 0.5 –1 cm. The frag- ment was immediately frozen and conserved in liquid nitrogen forgene expression analysis.Human handgrip strength Participants with either an absolute iron deficiency (AID) or a func- tional iron deficiency (FID) were included in the clinical study.AIDis defined by an iron-saturation of transferrin (TSAT) <20% and serum ferritin level <30 ng/ml.FID is defined by a TSAT <20% and serum ferritin levels above 30 ng/ml.Patients were treated witha single infusion of 1,000 mg of iron intravenously (ferriccarboxymaltose).The participants were asked to perform two handgrip tests to measure their strength using a hand dynamometer.The first hand-grip test (HG1) was conducted prior to iron administration.
The sec-ond handgrip test (HG2) was conducted within 2 –12 days after the iron IV administration. The hand dynamometer was calibrated and the measurements have an accuracy of +//C05%.The test –retest reliability is good (r>0.80) and the inter-rater reliability is excellent ( r=0.98).The handgrip test required the participants to be seated, position- ing their forearm of their hand in a 90 °angle with their body.The arm should not be pressed to the body or supported by an armrestand the shoulders should be relaxed.The grip of the hand dyna-mometer was adjusted to the hand size of the participant.The handdynamometer was placed in the dominant hand and the participantwas asked to squeeze the hand dynamometer as hard as possibleuntil the strength indicator was stabilized (this took approximately3–5 s).This was repeated three times, in between each measure- ment the participant was given 30 s to relax the arm and handmuscles.
All participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study and the study was approved by the Antwerp UniversityHospital ethical committee in accordance with the ethical standardsestablished by the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Animal experimentation All animal experiments were authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health and carried out according to the European Community guid-ing principles in the care and use of animals.The BaF experimentsperformed in Belgium were approved by and performed in accor-dance with the guidelines of the local ethics committee from theUCLouvain, Belgium.Housing conditions were as specified by theBelgian Law of 29 May 2013, regarding the protection of laboratoryanimals.In all experiments, female littermates of 8 –10 weeks were assigned randomly to experimental groups.
Cancer cell lines (C26colon murine adenocarcinoma and LLC Lewis lung carcinoma,1×10 6cells/mouse) were injected subcutaneously in the flank of 8- weeks-old female mice (BALB/C for C26, C57 BL/6 for LLC). Baf3cachexia was induced as previously reported (Bindels et al, 2012), injecting Bcr-Abl-transfected Baf3 intravenously in 6-weeks-oldBalb/C mice.LLC (Lewis Lung Carcinoma) tumor-bearing micewere necropsied at day 24.For C26, to compare the various treat-ment all mice were necropsied at day 12, except for the survivalexperiment.Electroporation experiments were performed as previ-ously described (Sartori et al, 2021) on tibialis anterior muscle with pHuji-TFR1 plasmid (Addgene 61505) or shTFR-GFP plasmid usingBLOCK-iT PolII miR RNAi expression kit (Thermo Fisher K493600).Ferric carboxymaltose (Ferrinject 15 mg/kg, Vifor Pharma) or saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) was injected in the tail vein every5 days starting from day 5 post-C26 inoculation.
Blood was col-lected by cardiac puncture, and perfusion with PBS after anesthesiawas performed to obtain samples for iron quantification. For thephlebotomy experiment, retroorbital bleeding (400 µl of blood) was performed under anesthesia, and mice were fed with iron-depriveddiet (Mucedola) for 11 days before sacrifice.To measure strength,mice were held by the middle part of the tail and allowed to grabthe metal grid of a dynamometer (2Biol) in a parallel position beforebeing gently pulled backward.The maximal force generated by thegrip was recorded, and the measure was repeated six times.Toquantify muscle wasting, gastrocnemii and quadriceps were freshlyisolated, weighted, and normalized to the respective tibial length.Cell culture and in vitro treatments C2C12 myoblasts were purchased from ATCC and cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).After reaching fullconfluency, differentiation was induced by switching to 2% horseserum (HS) DMEM for 4 days.
Human myoblast cell line, originatedfrom the quadriceps of a 38-year-old male donor. The cells were cul-tured in Skeletal Muscle Cell Basal Medium (PromoCell, Heidelberg,Germany) containing 5% FBS and supplemented with hbFGF, hEGF,fetuin, insulin, and dexamethasone.Differentiation was induced byswitching to DMEM containing 10 µg/ml insulin, gentamicin 1% (Gibco) for 7 days.Conditioned medium (CM) was prepared as previously described (Wyart et al, 2018).Briefly, cancer cells were grown to high confluency, then conditioned in serum-free DMEM for 24 h,medium was harvested and centrifuged at 500 gfor 10 min.Super- natant was collected and used as CM at 10% final concentration.Deferoxamine (DFO, Sigma D9533) and bathophenanthroline disul-fonic acid (BPS, Sigma 146617) were used at 100 µM.Apotrans- ferrin (Sigma T0178), Hinokitiol (HNK, Sigma 469521), and ferriccitrate (Sigma F3388) were used at 400 µg/ml, 5 µM, and 250 nM, respectively.
Activin A (RnD Sytem 338-AC) and Dexamethasone(DEXA, Sigma D4902) were used at 1 nM and 1 µM, respectively. Rotenone was used at 20 nM.Myotubes were treated for 48 h for allcompounds.For cell transfection, C2C12 myoblasts were differenti-ated for 3 days prior to transfection with esiTFR1, esiNCOA4, oresiGFP (250 ng/ml) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen11668019).Myotubes were photographed and lysed at 72 h post-transfection.For myotube diameter quantification, pictures of ª2022 The Authors.Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0license EMBO reports 23:e53746 |2022 13of18Elisabeth Wyart et al EMBO reports myotubes were taken with phase contrast microscopy (Zeiss) at 20 × magnification, and myotube diameter was measured using the soft-ware JMicroVision as previously described (Murata et al, 2018).
Western Blotting Frozen gastrocnemius samples were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (150 mM of NaCl, 50 mM of Tris-HCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mM of EDTA) supplementedwith protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Proteinconcentration was determined using BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Sci-entific).Fifteen or thirty micrograms of protein from cell or gastroc-nemius lysates, respectively, were loaded per well on Mini-ProteanTGX Stain-Free precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-rad) for SDS-PAGE.Stain-Free imaging was performed using Chemidoc MP imager inorder to visualize total protein patterns.
Proteins were then trans-ferred onto PVDF membranes prior to immunoblotting analysis.Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies: P-Thr172-AMPK (Cell Signaling 2535), Total-AMPK (Cell Signaling 2532), Fer-ritin (Sigma F5012), IRP2(PA-116544), Transferrin Receptor 1 (SantaCruz sc65882), NCOA4 (Santa Cruz C-4), OxPhos cocktail (Thermo-fisher 8199), Ferroportin (Novus NBP1-21502), Vinculin (Cell Sig-naling 4650). Protein carbonylation was assessed by measuring thelevels of carbonyl groups using the OxyBlot protein oxidation detec-tion kit (Sigma-Aldrich S7150).Quantification analysis of blots wasperformed with Image Lab software (BioRad).Iron quantification and Heme assay Iron content in skeletal muscle was quantified by ICP-MS (Element- 2; Thermo-Finnigan, Rodano, Italy) using medium mass resolution(M/ΔM~4,000).Fifty to hundred milligrams of freshly excised and snap-frozen quadriceps were submitted to overnight dialysis.
Sam-ples were collected before and after dialysis to assess total andprotein-bound iron, respectively. Additionally, iron content was alsomeasured in isolated mitochondria from quadriceps.All sampleswere digested overnight in 0.5 ml of concentrated HNO 3(70%) and mineralized by microwave heating for 6 min at 150 °C (Milestone, Ethos Up Microwave Digestion System).A natural abundance ironstandard solution was analyzed in parallel in order to check forchanges in the systematic bias.The calibration curve was obtainedusing four iron standard solutions (Sigma-Aldrich) in the range of0.2–0.005 lg/ml.For liver and spleen iron, samples were heated at 180°C overnight and mineralized in 10 ml of HCl 3 M/ 10% trichlor- oacetic acid per gram of dry tissue overnight at 65 °C with gentle shaking.10 µl of supernatants were mixed with a solution of 1.7% of thioglycolic acid (TGA), 84.7% of sodium acetate acetic acid pH 4.5,13.6% of BPS (Sigma 146617).
After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, absor- bance was measured at 535 nm. Iron content was determined usinga standard curve of ferrous ammonium sulfate.Heme concentrationwas determined by fluorescence assay as previously described (Sin-clair et al, 2001).Saturated oxalic acid solution was added to 40 µg of proteins from gastrocnemius lysates prior to heating at 95 °C for 30 min.Samples were loaded in triplicates and fluorescence wasmeasured at 400 nm excitation and 662 nm emission wavelengths.Intracellular labile iron pool was measured as previously described with modifications (Schoenfeld et al, 2017).Briefly, C2C12 cells were treated with 500 nM Calcein AM (Sigma 56496)for 15 min and fluorescence intensity was measured using a micro- plate reader.Cells were then incubated for 15 min with 100 µmo f 2 0,20-Bipyridyl (BIP) prior to the second measurement of fluores- cence.The LIP was calculated as following : LIP (A.U) =MFI after BIP–MFI before BIP.
The obtained value were normalized on DAPI fluorescence intensity. Mitochondria isolation and metabolic assays Mitochondria were isolated from snap-frozen quadriceps by Mito- check Mitochondrial Isolation kit (Cayman chemical 701010).ATPcontent was quantified in 20 lg of fresh isolated mitochondria by CellTiter-Glo /C226Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega G7570).Aconitase activity was measured in quadriceps homogenates byenzymatic assay (Cayman Chemical 705502).Oxygen ConsumptionRate (OCR) measurements were conducted using a Seahorse XFe96analyzer according to manufacturer’s protocol.C2C12 cells weredirectly differentiated in XFe96 cell culture plates and treated with10% C26 CM, ferric citrate 250 nM, or the combination of both for48 h and incubated in 5% CO 2at 37 °C.
One hour prior to analysis, growth medium was replaced with assay medium (DMEM withoutphenol red and sodium bicarbonate (Corning 90-013-PB) that wassupplemented with 1 mM of pyruvate, 2 mM of L-glutamine, and 10 mM of glucose, pH 7.4) and incubated in a non-CO 2incubator. During assay, 1 lM of oligomycin (Sigma 495455), 1 lM of FCCP (Sigma C2920), and 0.5 lM of rotenone/antimycin A (Sigma R8875 and A8674) were sequentially injected into each well in accordancewith standard protocols.Absolute rates (p moles/min) were normal-ized to lg of protein determined by Bradford Assay (BioRad 5000006).Histology Extracted gastrocnemii were immediately frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at /C080°C.Transversal sections of 5 µm thickness were cut at the midbelly with a cryostat.
Sections were fixed for 10 min in PFA 4%, then blocked with 0.1% triton x-100, 1% BSA in PBS before incubating with primary antibodiesagainst fast/slow isoforms of myosin heavy chain and laminin(Abcam 91506, Abcam M8421, Santa Cruz 59854), followed by incu-bation with the corresponding secondary antibodies (Alexa-488,Alexa-568). For the electroporation of tibialis anterior with reporterplasmids, 8 lm cryosections were stained with AlexaFluor 555- conjugated Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA, Thermo Fisher ScientificW32464) and DAPI.Pictures were taken with a fluorescent micro-scope and fiber areas were measured with ImageJ software (morethan 500 fibers were analyzed per animal).The enzymatic activityof succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) was assessed on cryosectionsusing the Succinic Dehydrogenase Stain (Bio-Optica, 30 –30114LY) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA isolation and quantitative PCR Total RNA was isolated from snap-frozen tissue samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen 15596026) according to the manufac-turer’s guidelines. 1 µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase kit (Applied Biosys-tems 4374966).cDNA was analyzed by Real Time Quantitative PCR 14of18 EMBO reports 23:e53746 |2022 ª2022 The Authors.Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0licenseEMBO reports Elisabeth Wyart et al (ABI PRISM 7900HT FAST Real-Time PCR system, Applied Biosys- tems) using the Luna Universal Probe qPCR master mix (NEBM3004) and the Universal Probe Library system (Roche Applied Sci-ence), or with SYBR Green master mix (Applied BiosystemsA25741).
Relative mRNA levels were calculated using the 2- DDCT method and normalized to GAPDH or 18s mRNA (Eukaryotic 18srRNA Endogenous Control, Thermo Fisher 4310893E), respectively.For human skeletal muscle biopsies, 500 ng of RNA was reversetranscribed using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher 18090010).

Briefly, after removal of connec-tive tissues, muscle samples were homogenized for 1 min in ice-coldlysis buffer (25 mM of Hepes pH 8, 5 mM of KCl, 0.5 mM of MgCl 2, 1% NP-40, 1 ×protease inhibitors) using a tight-fitting Teflon pestle attached to a Potter S homogenizer (Sartorius Stedium) set to1,000 rpm. Following centrifugation at 800 gfor 15 min at 4 °Ct o pellet the nuclei and cell debris, the supernatants were collected,subjected to further centrifugation three times at 500 gfor 15 min at 4°C to remove residual nuclei and used for the REMSA as nuclei-free total cytosolic protein fractions.The IRP-IRE interactions wereperformed using the LightShift Chemiluminescent RNA Electropho-retic mobility shift assay kit (REMSA, Thermo Fisher 20148).
Briefly,20ll of reaction containing nuclease-free water, 5 ×REMSA Binding Buffer (50 mM of Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 750 mM of KCl, 0.5% Triton-X100, 62.5% glycerol), tRNA (Thermo Fisher 20158), 6 lg of muscle cytosolic extracts, biotinylated and unlabeled ferritin probe 5 0– UCCUGCUUCAACAGUGCUUGGACGGAAC –30and where indicated, 0.5 mM of EDTA and 1 mM of DTT, were incubated for 30 min atroom temperature. Afterward, the samples were carefully mixedwith 5 llo f5 ×REMSA Loading Buffer and resolved on 6% polyacryl- amide gel and transferred on to nylon membrane (Roche Diagnos-tics, Indianapolis, IN).After the membrane was cross linked withUV-light, the IRP-IRE complexes were visualized by the chemilumi-nescent nucleic acid detection module (Thermo Fisher 20158).mtDNA copy number analysis Briefly, DNA was isolated from C2C12 myotubes using phenol –chlo- roform method as reported in (Quiros et al, 2017).
Approximately 50 ng total DNA was used for quantitative analysis of mtDNA levelby qPCR using SYBR Green master mix. The relative copy numberof mtDNA was determined using mitochondrial-specific primers forND1 and 16S and nuclear specific Hexokinase 2 (HK2): Gene Forward sequence ( 50–30) Reverse sequence ( 30–50) 16S rRNACCGCAAGGGAAAGATGAAAGAC TCGTTTGGTTTCGGGGTTTC ND1 CTAGCAGAAACAAACCGGGC CCGGCTGCGTATTCTACGTT HK2 GCCAGCCTCTCCTGATTTTAGTGT GGGAACACAAAAGACCTCTTCTGG Quantitative analysis was carried out using the following reac- tion conditions; the pre-amplification step was carried out at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing was performed at 58 °C for 30 s and final extension was carried out at 72°C for 30 s.After obtaining the Ct values, the mtDNA copy num- ber was calculated using the following formula: DCt=Ct(mtDNA gene) /C0Ct(nDNA gene).
Fusion index After 48 h treatment with C26CM and FeCM as described previ- ously, cells were fixed in 4% PFA, permeabilized and stained forMyosin Heavy Chain (Sigma M4276) and nuclei were stained withDAPI. The fusion index was determined as followed : (fusion%)=(number of nuclei per myotube)/(total number of nuclei in the field.At least 6 random fields (10 ×magnification) were ana- lyzed per condition using the ImageJ Software.Quantification and statistical analysis All graphs show mean /C6SEM.N represents the total number of independent experiments.Statistical significance was tested as indi-cated in figure legends with GraphPad Prism (version 6.0, GraphPadSoftware).Statistical significance was tested using two-tailed Stu-dent’s t-test for comparisons of two groups, one-way Anova followed by Bonferroni correction for comparisons of multiplegroups with one variable, or two-way Anova followed by Tukey’smultiple comparison test.
