LC prevents the production of ammonia with no significant effect on renal ammonia excretion. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of sodium benzoate (SB) and phenyl acetate (PA) on reducing VIHA.Materials and methods: Eight groups treated with Sodium Valproate (SV) at 300 mg/kg and 15 minutes later with normal saline, SB (144 mg/kg), PA (0.3 g/kg), LC (2.5 g/kg), SB (144 mg/kg) plus PA (0.3 g/kg), or SB (144 mg/kg) plus PA (0.3 g/kg) plus LC (2.5 g/kg), intraperitoneally.Other groups were exposed to normal saline, SB, LC or PA alone.Animal’s motor function and serum ammonia, lactate, and sodium levels were assessed at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 hours after the SV injection.Results: The results showed that LC reduced SV-induced hyperammonemia just at one and half-hour after treatment (P<0.001).PA, alone or in combination with other antidotes, reduced serum ammonia at all evaluated times (P<0.001).
LC improved the impaired motor function of animals only at 1.5 hours, while PA, alone or in combination decreased the motor function scores at different times. However, SB administration alone did not change SV-induced hyperammonemia or motor function impairment.There was no significant difference in the level of serum aminotransferases, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine between groups.Conclusion: These find - ings define that PA had a better therapeutic effect on valproate-induced hyperammonemia in comparison with SB.Co-administration of LC with PA ameliorated the elevated levels of ammonia and may relieve potential therapeutic application against acute SV intoxication.Keywords: Carnitine, hyperammonemia, phenylacetates, sodium benzoate, toxicity, valproic acid Introduction Sodium valproate (SV) is a monocarboxylate compound with anticonvulsant and mood-sta - bilizing properties.It is widely used in the treat - ment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain, and migraine.
SV acts as a histone dea- cetylase inhibitor and increases the gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) level in the brain. It also alters voltage-dependent sodium, potas - sium and calcium channels activity [1].SV may cause serious side effects, including hepatoto- xicity, coagulopathies, pancreatitis, bone mar -row suppression, hyperammonemia and incre- ase the risk of fetal abnormalities [2-4].SV- induced encephalopathy is frequently correlat - ed with hyperammonemia without any sign of hepatic failure [5].This serious condition can be controlled if the diagnosis is made at an early stage [6].Hyperammonemia refers to a clinical condition characterized by elevated blood ammonia level (>40 μmol/l) and mani - fested by neurological abnormalities such as lethargy, irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, hy- perventilation, grunting respiration, and seizure [7, 8].
Serum ammonia level (SAL) more than Sodium benzoate and phenylacetate in valproate toxicity 325 Int J Physiol Pathophysiol Pharmacol 2022; 14(6) :324-331200 mmol/l has also been associated with increased intracranial pressure and brain her - niation [7]. Currently, few treatment strategies are avail - able for hyperammonemic state.L-carnitine (LC) is commonly used in the treatment of val - proate-induced hyperammonemia (VIHA) that prevents the production of ammonia with no significant effect on renal excretion [9].Sodium benzoate (SB) and phenylacetate (PA) are the main part of hyperammonemia therapy in pedi - atrics and adults and exert their effect through increasing the renal excretion of nitrogenous compounds (primarily ammonia) [10, 11].Hipp- uric acid is formed by the interaction of SB and glycine, excreted from urine and eliminates the extra amount of blood ammonia [12].PA also maintains normal plasma ammonia level through phenyl acetyl glutamine urinary excre - tion [13].
Due to LC limitation in decreasing the VIHA, this study was conducted to evaluate the potentials effect of SB and PA, alone or in combination with LC, to reduce the ammonia level as a seri - ous side effect of acute valproate toxicity. Materials and methods Male Wistar rats weighing 250 -300 g (n=60) were obtained from Central Animal Facility, Mashhad University of Medical Science, Mash- had, Iran.They were kept under a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle and standard temperature.Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (IR.mums.sp.1394.42).SB, PA and LC were purchased from Sigma, Germany and SV was purchased from Sanofi, France.Animals were randomly divided into ten groups, six per each.Six group of animal were treated with SV.Fifteen minutes after the single injec - tion of SV (300 mg/kg), the animal received normal saline (SV group), SB (144 mg/kg), PA (0.3 g/kg), LC (2.5 g/kg), SB+PA, or SB+PA and LC.
The other four groups only received normal saline (control), SB, LC or PA without SV treat - ment. All injections were done intraperitoneally.SV was administrated at a dose that produced a significant increase in blood ammonia levels.The other doses were selected based on the previous studies [14, 15].Motor function The motor function of animals were evaluated using modified De Bleecker scoring: Grade 0: normal mobility; Grade 1: ataxic gait or slight weakness; Grade 2: stretch movements, decre- ase in motor activity or weakness in the control of the condition after tail stimulation; Grade 3: severe imbalances and only standing after tail stimulation; Grade 4: no voluntary movements after tail stimulation, no writhing reflexes, and four limb paralysis [16, 17].Biochemical parameters SAL, serum lactate level (SLL), and sodium concentration were assessed at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 hours after SV treatment.
The serum liver ami - notransferases (ALT and AST) and creatinine, as well as blood urea nitrogen, were also evalu - ated at 1.5 hours after SV treatment. Blood samples were taken through rat orbital sinus at 0.5 and 1 hours and via cardiac puncture at 1.5 hours post treatment.The serum ammonia level was determined by a kit from Sigma (#AA0100).Briefly, in this method, ammonia reacts with α-ketoglutaric acid, and reduced NADPH in the presence of L-glutamate dehydrogenase which results in formation of L-glutamate and NAD+.The oxida - tion of NAD+ was measured spectrophotomet - rically at 340 nm.Lactate production assay was also performed using the Lactate Assay kit (#MAK064) from Sigma according to the manufacturer’s instructions.The principle of this kit is based on the generation of pyruvate and H2O2 through the reaction between lac - tate and lactate oxidase.The produced H2O2 interacts with a probe to produce color that was measured at 570 nm.
The serum level of AST, ALT, sodium, BUN, and creatinine were assayed using a biochemical auto analyzer instrument (Type 7170, Hitachi, Japan) of Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad Iran. Statistical analysis The data were expressed as mean ± SEM.All data, except for motor function, were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) fol - lowed by Tukey’s as post-test.The results of motor function were compared by using non - parametric Kruskal-Wallis test.P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.All data analyses were conducted using SPSS 11.0 for Windows.Sodium benzoate and phenylacetate in valproate toxicity 326 Int J Physiol Pathophysiol Pharmacol 2022; 14(6) :324-331Results The effect of sodium benzoate, L-carnitine, and phenyl acetate on motor function of valproate intoxicated rat The results showed that the motor function of the SV group was significantly lower than con - trol group at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 hours (P<0.001).
There was no significant difference between SV and SV+SB group at any mentioned time. LC improved the impaired motor function of animals only after 1.5 hours in comparison with the SV group (P<0.001).PA-treated ani -induced hyperlactatemia at just around 1 hour (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively) ( Figure 3 ).In comparison with the control group, SV also significantly raised the serum sodium concen - tration at 0.5 and 1 hours (P<0.001).However, neither LC nor SB or PA could significantly change the SV-induced hypernatremia ( Figure 4).There was no significant difference in the level of serum aminotransferases, blood urea nitro - gen, and creatinine between any groups ( Table 1).Figure 1.Phenylacetate improved motor function scores of sodium valpro - ate intoxicated rats sooner than other antidotes.Data shown as median ± IQR.Each group included six rats.Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical analysis.

Co-administ- ration of SB+PA or SB+PA+LC and SV, also developed the motor function impairment (PV<0.001) ( Figure 1 ). There was no significant difference between the results of three sham groups and control gro- up.The effect of sodium benzo - ate, L-carnitine, and phenyl acetate on biochemical pa - rameters of valproate intoxi - cated rat SV-administration induced el- evated SAL in comparison wi- th control group (P<0.001).LC reduced the raised SAL just at the half and one hour after treatment (P<0.01).PA alone or in combination with other compounds reduced SAL at all times in SV-intoxicated rats (P<0.001).However, SB was not effective at any time ( Fig- ure 2 ).SV administration also signifi - cantly increased the SLL com - pared to the control group (P< 0.001).PA, SB, and LC, alone or in combination therapy sig - nificantly decreased the SLL at 1.5 hours.
But only LC, alone or in combination with others, could reduce the SV- Sodium benzoate and phenylacetate in valproate toxicity 327 Int J Physiol Pathophysiol Pharmacol 2022; 14(6) :324-331Discussion The results of the present study showed that the administration of SV significantly increased the SAL. It is well documented that SV adminis - tration at single or repeated doses can induce hyperammonemia in animal models [18, 19].perammonemia is renal ammonia excretion [28].In renal tubules, ammonia is excreted as a result of the glutamine-to-glutamate conver - sion by glutaminase [29].The VIHA of renal ori - gin is related to increase glutaminase activity and glutamine transport across the mitochon - drial membrane [30].LC has no effect on this Figure 3.L-carnitine decreased the serum Lactate level of sodium valproate intoxicated rats sooner than other antidotes.The data were presented as mean ± SEM from the experiment on six rats.

SV: Valproate, SB: Sodium benzoate, PA: Phenylacetate, LC: L-carnitine.The intravenous injection of SV at 200 mg/kg leading to 100% increase in the arterial ammonia that persist up to 100 min [20]. Patients receiv - ing treatment with SV also ex- perienced an increased level of ammonia, and there was a relationship between SAL and clinical manifestations [21].Valproate toxicity decreased the level of consciousness due to hyperammonemia [22].Our results showed a direct correlation between the motor function and SAL, however, we did not evaluate the brain ammonia level of rats.In this study, PA, alone or in combi- nation with other compounds, completely reversed the im- paired motor function of SV- intoxicated rats.Omega oxidation metabolites of valproate interfere with car - bamoyl phosphate synthase, a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a significant role in the first step of the urea cycle and result in hyperammone - mia [23].
Currently, LC is the recommended compound for the treatment of VIHA that acts through improving the beta-oxidation of valproate [9, 24, 25]. Case reports as well as clinical trials have also rais- ed possibility in alleviating the ammonia level and encepha - lopathy with carnitine therapy in subjects with VIHA [9, 26, 27].Metabolism of SV will not shift toward omega oxidation if there is a present sufficient concentration of LC.Another contributor to SV-induced hy- Sodium benzoate and phenylacetate in valproate toxicity 328 Int J Physiol Pathophysiol Pharmacol 2022; 14(6) :324-331pathway and is mainly effective in inhibition of ammonia production rather than increasing the renal excretion.It was demonstrated that pretreatment with LC failed to reduce non-val - proate hyperammonemia in rat model [15].
In the present study, LC was administrated when serum ammonia concentration was above nor - mal level and reduced the raised ammonia con - centration up to one and a half hours after treatment. As the half-life of SV is 1 to 5 hours in rats [31], it seems that ammonia reduction at 1.5 hour is related to the synergism of valpro - ate elimination kinetic and the effect of LC on ammonia production.Previous studies have shown that SB was able to reduce SAL, allevi - ate the symptoms, and even reduce the rate of mortality following hepatic encephalopathy [32, 33].Moreover, there are a few case reports regarding the successful treatment of VIHA with SB [34].However, in the present study, SB treatment did not significantly decrease the SAL.It has been reported that one mole of glycine conjugated to benzoate removes one mole of ammonia [32].This process is energy consum - ing and is interfered by coenzyme A ester.
SV reduces the levels of necessary cofactors of the urea cycle; free coenzyme A, acetyl-CoA, and carnitine in the cytoplasm [28] and res- ults in raising the blood and hepatocyte con - centrations of glycine [32, 35]. On the other hand, 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid, a metabolite major mitochondrial enzyme of the urea cycle [37].Furthermore, experimental and clinical studies showed the increased mortality rate following administration of SB in hyperammo - nemia [38, 39].Palekar and colleagues treated rats with L-norvaline, a strong inhibitor of orni - thine trans carbamylase, and SB.They reported that SB increased serum and liver ammonia instead of returning SAL to the normal level [40].SB was also ineffective in the prevention of ammonia accumulation in isolated hepato - cytes [40, 41].It was indicated that micromolar levels of monocarboxylate compounds, such as SB and SV, initiated the mitochondrial permeability transition in isolated liver mitochondria [42].
Mitochondrial permeability transition is a pro - cess that leads to failure of oxidative phosphor - ylation, the formation of reactive oxygen spe - cies, and cell death by apoptosis or necrosis [43]. It may also have a role in the pathogenes- is of Reye’s syndrome [44], which is character - ized by hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, micr- ovesicular steatosis, and encephalopathy [42].Therefore, the administration of SB during SV intoxication could increase the risk of liver dys - function problems such as Reye’s syndrome and hyperammonemia.Although there are, many documents regarding the use of SB for hyperammonemia, in this study, SB could not reduce VIHA, although the levels of liver trans - aminases were normal [33, 34].Table 1.

For the above-mentioned reasons, it may be suggested that the total capacity of SB in conjugation with glycine and decreasing the ammonia level was decreased. In this study, SB administration alone could not improve the mo- tor function, the increased blood ammonia level, and lactate level.Owing to the above reason, the failure of SB on ammonia deto- xification and reduction of VIHA can be justified.It was also re- ported that treatment of ammo - nium acetate-induced hyperam - monemia with a non-toxic dose of SB in rats enhanced mortality due to the strong inhibition of ornithine trans carbamylase, as a Sodium benzoate and phenylacetate in valproate toxicity 329 Int J Physiol Pathophysiol Pharmacol 2022; 14(6) :324-331Sodium phenylbutyrate, a pro-drug of PA that is known as a monocarboxylate compound the - oretically induces mitochondrial permeability transition [44].However, we did not find any evidence for mitochondrial toxicity of the PA metabolite in the literature.
In the present stu- dy, the administration of PA, alone or in combi - nation with SB and LC, return the blood ammo - nia level to the normal range. A small cohort study in in the United States and Canada showed that the combination of intravenous sodium phenyl acetate and sodium benzoate was more effective in decreasing the plasma ammonium levels and improving survival in patients with historically lethal urea-cycle enzy- me disorder [45].The combined therapy with sodium phenyl acetate and sodium benzoate has been approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hyperammonemia in patients with urea cycle enzyme disorders since 1980s [45].Each mole of PA conjugated to glutamine removes two moles of ammonia [35].Combi- nation of PA and LC can be a potential treat - ment for VIHA through increasing the ammonia excretion and reducing the ammonia produc- tion.
Based on the results, all animals treated with valproate had significantly high serum levels of lactic acid and only LC, alone or in combination with the other two antidotes, returned SLL to the normal level. In liver cells, LC attaches valproate-Co A instead of acetyl coenzyme A and enters into the mitochondria.Decreasing the storage of LC and acetyl coenzyme A during SV toxicity shifts cellular metabolism to fatty acids and induces lactic acidosis [46].Lactic acidosis has been reported in SV intoxicated patients with serum valproate level greater than 850 mg/l [47].LC improves the fatty acid metabolism by transferring long-chain free fatty acids to mitochondria and buffering the ratio of free CoA to acyl-CoA [48, 49].It seems that the role of LC in getting the lactic acid level back to normal is related to improve lipid metabolism and increase the amount of acyl- coenzyme A [50].Cooke et al.
(2009) reported a 43-year-old man who ingested 40 grams of SV with serum con - centration of 1470 mg/l (serum levels above 1000 mg/l may cause death) and SAL of 850 µmol/l. He was unresponsive and hypotensive.He became hemodynamically unstable, and his general condition deteriorated rapidly with rising lactic acidosis despite supportive treat - ment.Treatment by combination of LC, SB and sodium phenyl acetate resulted in rapid nor - malization of serum valproate, ammonia levels and neurological function without hemodialy - sis.The authors did not report the serum sodi - um level and other biochemical parameters [51].High sodium serum levels up to 1.5 hours after treatment were due to the sodium salt of valproic acid.The sodium levels of SB-treated rats did not return to normal level even after 1.5 hours.As we used sodium-free PA, PA+SV- treated rats showed similar sodium levels.
However, SB or PA, alone or in combination therapy for valproic acid-induced toxicity have been associated with hypernatremia. The result of this study did not show significant differences in the level of serum aminotransfer - ases, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine in SV-intoxicated group.Also, Farooq and col - leagues reported a 44-year-old male with val - proate-induced hyperammonemic encephalop - athy with normal liver function tests [52].Conclusion The results of this study showed that during acute SV poisoning, administration of PA result - ed in better therapeutic effects in comparison with SB.Moreover, co-administration of LC with PA may show a better therapeutic response.Acknowledgements This article was extracted from a doctoral the - sis, which is conducted based on the research funding (grant no.941313) in Mashhad Uni- versity of Medical Sciences.Disclosure of conflict of interest None.Address correspondence to: Dr.
