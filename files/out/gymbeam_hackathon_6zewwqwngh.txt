This study oﬀers a detailed examina tion of these deﬁciencies’ prevalence trends and gender and regional variati ons using Global Burden of Disease Study data from /one.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum to /two.tnum/zero.tnum/one.tnum/nine.tnum.

Results: In /two.tnum/zero.tnum/one.tnum/nine.tnum, Central Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest prevalence of Vitamin A deﬁciency, particularly among males, and iodine deﬁci ency peaked in the same region for both genders. South Asia had the hi ghest incidence of protein-energy malnutrition for both genders.R egions with a low Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) showed lower ASR for these deﬁcienci es.Notably, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and Maldives recorded the highest ASR for vitamin A deﬁciency, iodine deﬁciency, and protein-energy mal nutrition, respectively.The declining ASR trend for vitamin A deﬁciency, es pecially among males, suggests eﬀective interventions.East Asia saw a signi ﬁcant increase in iodine deﬁciency ASR from /one.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum to /two.tnum/zero.tnum/one.tnum/nine.tnum, particularly among women, re quiring targeted interventions.The rising ASR of protein-energy mal nutrition in several regions, especially among men, raises concerns.

Iodine, vitamin A, protein, and energy are essential nutrients for the human body, playing a role in numerous physiological functions. Insuﬃciency or deﬁciency of these nutrients can result in signiﬁcant health problems.Iodine deﬁciencyistheleadingcauseofpreventablecognitiveimpairments and is linked to thyroid dysfunction, miscarriages, premature births, stillbirths, and congenital deformities ( 1).Vitamin A deﬁciency is a signiﬁcant factor in childhood blindness and mortality, as well as its links to infectious diseases, anemia, and reproductive health ( 2).Insuﬃcient protein and energy intake can weaken the immune system, elevating susceptibility to infections and mortality.The World Health Organization acknowledgesiodinedeﬁciency,vitaminAdeﬁciency,andprotein- energy malnutrition as global public health issues ( 3).
As per the 2020 Global Nutrition Report, iodine deﬁciency, vitamin A deﬁciency, and protein-energy malnutrition represent substantial global risk factors for mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) ( 4). Despite substantial public health endeavors in recent decades to tackle this problem, elevated prevalence rates endure in low- and middle-income regions ( 5).The main reasons include economic constraints leading to a monotonous diet, lack of education and awareness about nutrition, soil and environmental factors aﬀecting the nutritional value of food, heavy disease burdens impacting nutrient absorption, and social and cultural customs restricting the intake of nutrient-rich foods.Moreover, inadequate health systems, absence of targeted nutrition policies, andtheadverseeﬀectsofclimatechangeonagriculturalproduction have all exacerbated nutritional problems in these countries (6,7).
In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly set forth the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to eliminate all malnutrition forms by 2030 ( 8). This encompasses tackling health issues like child growth stunting, wasting, adolescent malnutrition, and the nutritional needs of pregnant, lactating women, and the elderly.To attain this goal, acquiring an understanding of the patterns and temporal trends in iodine deﬁciency, vitamin A deﬁciency, and protein-energy malnutrition incidence can facilitate the adoption of more focused preventive strategies, thereby contributing to the attainment of the Sustainable DevelopmentGoals.The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study has evaluated the prevalence of iodine deﬁciency, vitamin A deﬁciency, and protein-energy malnutrition in 204 countries and regions across the globe ( 9).This provides a distinct opportunity to gain insights into how to address these deﬁciencies.
In this study, we aim to evaluate the temporal trends in the incidence of iodine deﬁciency, vitamin A deﬁciency, and protein-energy malnutrition from a global, regional, and national perspective over the period from 1990 to 2019. Our research ﬁndings can contribute to the development of targeted prevention and intervention strategies that are tailored to the needs of diﬀerent nations andpopulations./two.tnum Materials and methods /two.tnum./one.tnum Study data We gathered data on the incidence, age-standardized incidence, and mortality rates of iodine deﬁciency, vitamin A deﬁciency, and protein-energy malnutrition, broken down by gender, region, and country.These data span from 1990 to 2019 and were collected through the GBD Results Tool (GHDx) available at: http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool .The dataset encompassed 204 countries and territories.
Subsequently, we categorized these nations and regions into ﬁve groups based on the sociodemographic index (SDI), which includes low, low-middle, middle, high-middle, and high categories. Additionally, we partitioned the globe into 21 geographical regions (SupplementaryTable1 ).A comprehensive account of the indicators, data sources, and statistical models employed in GBD 2019 has been documented in previous publications and adheres to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting ( 9,10).According to the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), protein-energy malnutrition is coded as E40–E46.9; iodine deﬁciency is coded as E00-E02, and vitaminAdeﬁciencyiscodedasE50–E50.9.
/two.tnum./two.tnum Statistical analysis To assess the trends in iodine deﬁciency, vitamin A deﬁciency, and protein-energy malnutrition, we use age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC).Directcomparisonbetweenpopulationswithdiﬀerentage structures can introduce bias in crude rate comparisons. Hence, standardizing rates is essential.ASR (per 100,000 individuals) is calculated using the direct method and is deﬁned by Equation (1).EAPC is a commonly utilized metric for summarizing rate trends overspeciﬁctimeintervals.Itiscomputedusingalinearregression model, as represented in Equations (2,3).We determine a 95% conﬁdence interval using the EAPC formula mentioned earlier.The standard error is obtained from ﬁtting the regression line.If both the estimated EAPC value and its lower 95% conﬁdence limit are>0, the age-standardized rate is considered to be increasing.
Conversely, if both the estimated EAPC value and its upper 95% conﬁdence limit are <0, the age-standardized rate is considered to be decreasing. All statistical analyzes were conducted using the R program (Version 4.2.1, R Core Team).A P-value <0.05 was regardedasstatisticallysigniﬁcant.ASR=∑A i=1aiωi∑A i=1ωi×100,000 (1) where i denotes the ithage class; adenotes age-speciﬁc rates; ω denotesthenumberofpeople(orweight) y=α+βx+ǫ (2) EAPC=100×(exp(β)−1) (3) Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org Ji et al.

The ASR for iodine deﬁciency exhibited a global decline from 1990 to 2000, followed by a slow increase from 2000 to 2005, and a subsequent decline.In high SDI, low-middle SDI, and low SDIregions, the ASR for iodine deﬁciency decreased from 1990 to 2019, while in high-middle SDI and middle SDI regions, there was a pattern of decrease, increase, and then decrease ( Figure2; SupplementaryFigures3 –7).From1990to2010,theglobalASRfor protein-energy malnutrition showed an increasing trend, followed by a decline from 2010 to 2015, and then a subsequent increase.
In high SDI, high-middle SDI, and middle SDI regions, the ASR for protein-energy malnutrition exhibited an upward trend from 1990 to 2010, followed by a decline from 2010 to 2015. Conversely, in low-middle SDI and low SDI regions, there was a decline in the ASR from 2010 to 2015.Post-2015, diﬀerent SDI regions witnessed an upward trend in the ASR for protein-energy malnutrition ( Figure2;SupplementaryFigures3 –7).Furthermore, on a global scale and across diﬀerent SDI regions, the general trend in the ASRs of vitamin A deﬁciency, iodine deﬁciency, and protein-energy malnutrition remained consistent from 1990 to 2019 for both males and females.However, the ASR were generally higher in males for vitamin A deﬁciency and protein- energymalnutrition,whilefemalesexhibitedhigherASRforiodine deﬁciency ( Figure2;SupplementaryFigures3 –7).
In 21 regions worldwide, from 1990 to 2019, the ASR of iodine deﬁciency in East Asia showed an increasing trend of (EAPC = 0.17; 95% CI: –0.28 to 0.62), mainly among women (EAPC = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.04). The ASR of protein-energy malnutrition in the regions of Australasia, East Asia, Central Europe, Western Europe, and Southern Latin America also showed an upward trend, more pronounced in men than in women (EAPC >0).No regions were found where the ASR of vitamin A deﬁciency showedanincreasingtrendfrom1990to2019(EAPC <0;Figure2; SupplementaryTables1 ,4,7).From 1990 to 2019, the ASR of vitamin A deﬁciency showed a decreasing trend (EAPC <0) in 204 countries globally.Among them, Equatorial Guinea exhibited the most signiﬁcant decline (EAPC=–9.90;95%CI:–10.39to–9.41),followedbySaudiArabia and Maldives.
In both females (EAPC = –9.88; 95% CI: –10.32 to –9.43) and males (EAPC = –10.09; 95% CI: –10.62 to –9.56), Equatorial Guinea showed the most prominent decrease in the ASR for vitamin A deﬁciency ( Figure3;SupplementaryFigures8 , 9;SupplementaryTables13 –15). Twelve countries and regions experienced an increasing trend in the ASR for iodine deﬁciency from 1990 to 2019.The sequence of this upward trend included the following: Philippines, Pakistan, Nepal, Republic of Moldova, South Sudan, Madagascar, Somalia, China, Kenya, Monaco, Portugal, and Andorra.

Our research indicates that vitamin A deﬁciency is particularly prevalent in Central Africa, especially in Cameroon, where the ASR of vitamin A deﬁciency among men is the highest.Zhao et al.’s study reveals that in 2019, the age-standardized DALYrate for vitamin A deﬁciency was highest in Central Sub-Saharan Africa,followedbyWesternSub-SaharanAfricaandagainWestern Sub-Saharan Africa ( 14).This condition is primarily inﬂuenced by poor dietary patterns, environmental pollution of water and soil, infections and diseases, and insuﬃcient iodine content in salt (15–17).
The local population predominantly relies on cereals, tubers, and legumes as their main food sources, while the intake of animal products, green or yellow vegetables, and fruits—foods rich in vitamin A or carotenoids—is relatively low, leading to inadequate vitamin A consumption ( 18). From 1990 to 2019, the annual incidence rate of vitamin A deﬁciency has declined, with a more pronounced decrease among men, indicating that the interventions and strategies implemented have achieved some success.Since 2000, mortality due to vitamin A deﬁciency has decreased by over 50%, likely attributable to improved nutritional status, enhanced water and sanitation conditions (such as the control of diarrhea), vaccination (such as measles vaccination), and vitamin A supplementation programs ( 19–21).However, the high incidence among women persists, suggesting the need for ongoing eﬀorts and gender-speciﬁc strategies.
our study highlights thatvitaminAdeﬁciencyhasbecomeamajorissueamongchildren and adolescents, a particularly vulnerable group for whom vitamin A is crucial for vision, immune function, and overall growth ( 22). GlobalresearchalsoidentiﬁesvitaminAdeﬁciencyinchildrenand adolescents as an increasingly signiﬁcant problem, underscoring theurgencyofaddressingthisissue( 23).In Central Africa, Equatorial Guinea exhibits the highest ASR of iodine deﬁciency.Research reports that in 2019, Somalia, the Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/six.tnum frontiersin.org Ji et al.

Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, and the Republic of the Congo had the highest age-standardized prevalence rates. Meanwhile,countrieslikethePhilippinesandPakistanhaveshown an increasing trend.Geographically, the highest prevalence rates are found in Central Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia ( 24).The primary cause is the limited consumption of iodine-rich foods such as seafood, milk, and eggs.Additionally, some foods contain goitrogens, such as thiocyanates and soy isoﬂavones, which inhibit iodine absorption and utilization, exacerbating iodine deﬁciency (25).According to a report, low iodine levels in soil and water in the region aﬀect both crops and drinking water, contributing to the deﬁciency.Moreover, soil and water contamination by heavy metals, pesticides, and industrial eﬄuents further destabilize and reduce iodine availability ( 15,26,27).Consuming iodized salt is an eﬀective and economical method to prevent and control iodine deﬁciency.
However, in sub-Saharan Africa, the coverage and quality of iodized salt remain inadequate, perpetuating the deﬁciency issue. Contributing factors include weak enforcement of iodization policies, insuﬃcient monitoring and evaluation, outdated technology and equipment, cost-beneﬁt disparities, and socio-cultural barriers ( 15,28).This study indicates that the global ASR of iodine deﬁciency decreased from 1990 to 2000, increased from 2000 to 2005, and then declined again, reﬂecting the impact ofglobalinitiatives,particularlytheUniversalSaltIodization(USI) policy(29).AccordingtoUNICEF’s2020report,124countrieshave mandated iodized salt, 21 allow voluntary iodization, and 88% of the global population uses iodized salt ( 30).
However, challenges persistinimplementingtheUSIpolicy,includinginaccurateiodine levels in salt, weak quality control and enforcement, low public awareness and education, and a lack of regular surveys and monitoring of iodine status and iodization program impacts ( 31).These challenges may explain the ASR increase from 2000 to 2005, as some countries experienced a resurgence or persistence of iodine deﬁciency due to weakened or interrupted USI policies. Researchalsoindicatesauniqueglobalpatternofiodinedeﬁciency, predominantly aﬀecting adolescents and young adults.Adequate iodine intake is crucial for thyroid function, and its deﬁciency can lead to various health issues, particularly during the critical developmental stages of adolescence and early adulthood ( 32).Therefore,ensuringsuﬃcientiodineintakeinthisagegroupisvital forpreventingrelatedhealthproblems.Protein-energy malnutrition is prevalent in South Asia, aﬀecting both genders equally.
Xu et al.’s research indicates that South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia rank highest in age-standardized prevalence ( 33). This phenomenon is likely linked to the region’s dense population and limited land resources.Additionally,climatechange,naturaldisasters,andpests impact agricultural production, resulting in unstable grain yields and subsequent food shortages ( 33–35).Furthermore, pervasive poverty, low per capita income, and high food prices in South Asia make it challenging for many to access suﬃcient protein and energy-rich foods ( 36).Social and cultural factors also play a signiﬁcant role in food distribution and consumption.In some areas, women and children are disadvantaged in food allocation, leading to insuﬃcient protein and energy intake.For example, in regions like India, religious and cultural practices often limit the intakeofanimal-basedfoods,withvegetarianismbeingwidespread (7,37,38).
Studies show a correlation between the Socio- Demographic Index (SDI) and the ASR of nutritional deﬁciencies. Regions with lower SDI tend to have lower ASR, indicating that socio-economic factors play a crucial role in the prevalence of nutritional deﬁciencies ( 39).This ﬁnding underscores the need for Frontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/eight.tnum frontiersin.org Ji et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/four.tnum./one.tnum/four.tnum/two.tnum/six.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum comprehensive strategies addressing both nutritional needs and broader socio-economic determinants.In absolute terms, India bears the greatest burden of nutritional deﬁciencies, followed by China and Indonesia.This may be attributed to their large populations, highlighting the need for country-speciﬁc strategies to address these issues.
However, it is essential to note that while discussing global averages, signiﬁcant variations can exist within countries in the same region ( 40). The global ASR of protein- energy malnutrition has experienced ﬂuctuations since 1990, with an initial rise, a subsequent decline, and another increase post- 2015, raising concerns and calls for renewed eﬀorts to address the issue.The rising trend in ASR in regions like Australia, East Asia, Central Europe, Western Europe, and Latin America, particularly among males, warrants attention.This indicates the inﬂuence of socio-economic factors on nutritional deﬁciencies in diﬀerent SDI regions, necessitating region-speciﬁc strategies ( 33).Protein-energy malnutrition primarily aﬀects children under ﬁve, highlightingtheimportanceofaddressingnutritionalneedsearlyin life.Duringthiscriticalgrowthanddevelopmentstage,deﬁciencies in protein and energy can have long-term impacts on physical and cognitive development ( 41).
Therefore, early nutritional interventionsarevitalforhealthychildhooddevelopment. To address these global nutritional challenges, comprehensive strategies are imperative.First, targeted public health campaigns should elevate awareness among children and adolescents about the critical importance of a vitamin A-rich diet, emphasizing its roles in vision, immune health, and overall growth.Additionally, strengthening iodine supplementation programs and educational initiatives for adolescents and young adults is crucial to ensure optimal thyroid function and prevent associated health issues.To combat protein-energy malnutrition in children under ﬁve, expandingcommunity-basednutritionprogramstoprovideaccess to nutrient-dense foods and oﬀer nutrition education to caregivers isessential.Collaborationamonggovernments,non-governmental organizations,andinternationalagenciesisvitalfordevelopingand implementingsustainablesolutions,promotingaholisticapproach toglobalnutritionacrossallagegroups.
To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the ﬁrst comprehensive overview and exploration of global disparities in vitamin A deﬁciency, iodine deﬁciency, and protein-energy malnutrition, along with their evolving patterns stratiﬁed by gender and age. This research has inherent limitations.Despite the adjustments made in GBD 2019 to account for biases and methodological ﬂaws in low-quality sampling, survey methods, and other data sources, the accuracy of the results is signiﬁcantly contingent upon the quality and quantity of the input data into themodel.Moreover,theabsenceofdiagnosticgoldstandardsand the potential interchangeability of these terms might lead to an underestimationofthescaleofthesediseases./five.tnum Conclusions Over the past several decades, substantial improvements have been made in addressing global issues related to vitamin A deﬁciency, iodine deﬁciency, and protein-energy malnutrition.
However, progress remains uneven on a global scale, with nutritionaldeﬁcienciesposingpersistentconcernsincountrieswithlower socioeconomic levels. Urgent policy safeguards and ongoing eﬀorts are imperative to control nutritional deﬁciencies in these regions.VitaminAdeﬁciencypredominantlyimpactschildrenand adolescents, while iodine deﬁciency primarily aﬀects adolescents and young adults.Meanwhile, protein-energy malnutrition is primarily observed among children under the age of 5.These ﬁndings underscore the necessity for age-speciﬁc interventions tailoredtothedistinctnutritionalneedsandchallengesofeachage group.Furtherresearchiswarrantedtocomprehendandtacklethe underlyingcausesoftheseage-speciﬁctrends.Data availability statement The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.The names of the repository/repositories and accession number(s) can be found in the article/Supplementarymaterial .
