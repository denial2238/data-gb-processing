MPS is regulated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway involving phosphorylation of the mTOR kinase complex which subsequently activates downstream eﬀectors, including ribosomal S6-kinase (rpS6), eventually leading to translation initiation (1, 2). It is well-known that protein ingestion and subsequent postprandial rise in essential amino acidconcentrationsstimulatesthemTORpathwayleadingtoan increase in muscle protein synthesis (3, 4).Amino acids have a dual role in stimulating protein synthesis by serving both as building blocks and essential metabolic signaling molecules needed for full activation the mTOR pathway (5).In particular, leucine has been described as the most potent amino acid responsible for activation of the mTOR pathway and induction of protein translation initiation (6).
Consequently, it is not surprising that MPS is aﬀected by the source of protein as both theamino acid proﬁleas well as proteindigestibility determines the amount of speciﬁc amino acids entering circulation. Studies in humans have illustrated that ingestion of proteins that are digested more quickly, such as whey, resulted in a greater extend of mTOR pathway activation and subsequent rates of MPS compared to more slowly digested proteins, including soy, wheat, or casein (7, 8).This diﬀerential anabolic eﬀect seems to be primarily mediated by a diﬀerence in available leucine as MPS rates were equalized between protein sources if additional leucinewassupplementedtothemeal (9).It is common practice in the equine industry to add protein-dense supplements to the diet when muscle building is desired, however, to date, no studies have compared the muscle anabolic eﬀects of diﬀerent sources of protein in horses.
It has been shown that the consumption of more digestible protein sources (e.g., from fortiﬁed concentrates) results in greater elevation of plasma essential amino acid concentrations and improved nitrogen balance compared to ingestion of lower digestible protein sources (e.g., from forages) (10). We have recentlyshownthattheingestionofaprotein-richmealactivates mTOR pathway proteins in skeletal muscle of horses in a dose- dependent manner 90min post feeding (11).However, whether mTOR phosphorylation is maximal at this timepoint in horses is currently unknown.Further characterization of the temporalchanges of the phosphorylation patterns of mTOR signaling proteins will provide valuable information regarding equine muscleremodelingfollowingproteinfeeding.While it has clearly been demonstrated that the presence of amino acids is essential for protein synthesis, insulin signaling also plays a role in mTOR pathway activation (12).
Several studies have illustrated that exogenous insulin administration increases phosphorylation of mTOR pathway proteins in equine muscle tissue (13, 14). Moreover, insulin resistant horses have decreased basal cell-surface GLUT- 4 expression (15)and decreased glycogen-synthase kinase phosphorylation (16).However, postprandial activation of mTORsignalingcomponentsinhorseswithnaturallyoccurring insulindysregulation(ID)hasnotyetbeeninvestigated.The objective of the current study was to evaluate the eﬀect of two dietary protein sources on time course changes in muscle translation initiation in ID and non-ID horses.
We hypothesized that: (1) consumption of a higher quality protein source would result in a greater intramuscular mTOR pathway activation compared to a lower quality protein source, (2) that postprandial muscle mTOR pathway activation would be maximized at 90min followed by gradual dephosphorylation of the signaling proteins and (3) that anabolic signal transduction inresponsetoproteinmealwouldbediminishedinIDhorses. Materials and methods Animals and housing Sixteen mature mares of mixed breed were selected from the University of Kentucky, Department of Veterinary Science research herd.Horses were identiﬁed based on their insulin status determined by an oral sugar test (OST) as previously described (17).Brieﬂy, two blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture before and 60min after administration of 0.15 mL/kg body weight (BW) of Karo light corn syrup.
BasedoncriteriapublishedbytheEquineEndocrinologyGroup (EEG), 8 insulin dysregulated (ID) and 8 non-ID horses were identiﬁed for the study (Table1), with ID deﬁned as plasma insulin concentrations >20 and >45µIU/mL at baseline and 60min post OST, respectively (18). Additionally, basal plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations were determined to exclude horses with pituitary pars intermedia Frontiersin VeterinaryScience /zero.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org Loos et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fvets./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./eight.tnum/nine.tnum/six.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnum TABLE /one.tnum Phenotypic measures and insulin status of ID and non-ID groups.

All horses had ACTH values <50 pg/mL with exception of one horse with levels of 80 pg/mL, which is considered“equivocal”forfallmonths.Asthishorseshowedno clinical signs of PPID, the decision was made to in include this horseinthestudy. Horses were housed in individual indoor stalls (3.5 × 3.5m) overnight and turned out into dry lot paddocks in pairs for ∼6 h/day.During turnout no feed was provided but all horses had ad libitum access to water, salt, and mineral blocks.To accurately measure changes in muscle protein synthetic pathways, it was essential that protein was the ﬁrst limiting nutrient, and horses remained in positive energy balance.Horses were individually fed and received 1.25% of BW per day (as fed) of timothy hay (Table2) oﬀered in a hay net.Based on the estimated digestible energy (DE) intake from the hay portion, each horse was fed 0.45% of BW of concentrate so that the total diet provided 120% of the daily DE requirements for average maintenance (20).
The custom- made concentrate mixture consisted of 44% whole oats, 45% beet pulp shreds, and 11% soybean oil (Table2). Additionally, a commercially available vitamin-mineral premix pellet (Cavalor Support,CavalorFeedsandSupplements,Deinze,Belgium)was added to the daily meals at the manufacturer’s recommended levelof100g/day.Thisdietaryregimenwasdesignedtomeetor exceed all nutrient needs for mature, idle horses with “average” maintenance requirements while minimizing excessive protein intake(20).Concentrate meals were fed in feed tubs at 800 and 1,600 and the daily allotment of hay was given in the afternoon.

for about 1h followed by collection of two basal blood samples (10mL,−15 and 0min pre feeding). Next, horses were lightly sedatedwith ∼0.25–0.5mg/kgofi.v.xylazinehydrochlorideand brought into holding stocks.The biopsy sites were aseptically scrubbed and anesthetized subcutaneously with 3mL of 12% lidocaine.A percutaneous sample of the Gluteus Medius muscle was collected through a single incision, using the Bergstrom needle technique as previously described (22).Subcutaneous fat thickness over the G luteus Medius muscle was evaluated prior to onset of the study using ultrasound imaging.Considering fat thickness only tended to diﬀer by 0.1cm (Table1) between insulingroups,thestandardizedmusclebiopsydepth(6cm)was keptequalforallhorses.Afterthebiopsywascompleted,horses were allowed to recover in their stalls.
Once sedation was fully wornoﬀ,eachhorsewasrandomlyassignedtoreceiveoneoftwo protein treatment pellets: a custom-made alfalfa pellet ( Table3, main protein source: alfalfa meal) or a commercially available protein supplement (Cavalor VitAmino; Cavalor Feeds and Supplements, Deinze, Belgium; Table3, main protein sources: soybean meal, alfalfa meal, potato protein). Apart from the protein sources, the two treatment pellets consisted of identical ingredients and were formulated to supply a similar amount of non-structural carbohydrates.Treatment meals were fedat an amount to provide 0.25g of CP/kg BW.We have previously shown (11)that this dose results in near-maximal mTOR pathway activation and would therefore allow for comparisonofthestimulatoryeﬀectofdiﬀerentproteinsources without overactivation of the muscle synthetic pathways.

All horses received 2g of phenylbutazone paste (1 g/2 ×daily) for 4 days Frontiersin VeterinaryScience /zero.tnum/four.tnum frontiersin.org Loos et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fvets./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./eight.tnum/nine.tnum/six.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnum after sample collections to alleviate any inﬂammation related to biopsy procedures.However, all biopsy sites healed quickly and normally.After 28 days of recovery, all sample procedures wererepeatedwhereeachhorsereceivedthealternatetreatment pellets.Muscle samples were collected from an area of the Gluteus Medius at least 2 inches away from any previous biopsy sitestoavoidpotentialscartissue.Aftercompletionofthestudy, all horses returned to the University of Kentucky, Department ofVeterinaryScienceherd.
Sample analyses Plasma glucose and insulin analyses Plasma glucose concentrations were determined enzymatically using an automated analyzer (YSI 2700 Select Analyzer, YSI Inc., Yellow Spring, OH). Plasma insulin levels were assayed using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (PI-12K, Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) validated for horsesaspreviouslydescribed (23).Allplasmasampleswererun in duplicate.Average intra and inter-assay variation for glucose was 0.3 and 3.4%, respectively.Average intra and inter-assay variationforinsulinwas7.6and7.4%,respectively.Plasma amino acid analysis Plasma free amino acid concentrations were determined by reverse-phase HPLC of phenyisothiocyanate derivatives as previously described (22).
Feed amino acid analysis concentrations were determined using cation-exchange chromatography (cIEC-HPLC) coupled with post-column ninhydrin derivatization and quantitation by a commercial laboratory (Agricultural Experiment Station Chemical Laboratories,UniversityofMissouri-Columbia,MO). Western immunoblot analysis Western immunoblot analysis of the muscle samples was performed as previously described (11).Brieﬂy, immediately after collection, muscle samples were homogenized, centrifuged and the supernatant was removed and stored at −80◦C until further analysis.Total protein content of the homogenate samples was determined using a Bradford assay (Cat.No.97065-020, VWR International, Indianapolis, IN) and samples were diluted in Laemmli buﬀer until further analysis.Proteins (20µg) of each sample were loaded on 8% (mTOR) or 12% (rpS6) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels and separated by SDS-PAGE.
Gels were run at 100V for 20min (stacking gel) after which voltage was increased to 180V and ran until the marker reached the bottom of the running gel. Proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane for immunoblotting.Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used against total (1:1,000; #2972, Cell Signaling Technology,Danvers, MA) and Ser2448phosphorylated (1:1,000; #2971, Cell SignalingTechnology,Danvers,MA)mTORandSer235/236and Ser240/244phosphorylated (1:2,000; #2211/#2215 Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) rpS6 while a monoclonal antibody was used against total rpS6 (1:10,000; #2217, Cell Signaling Technology,Danvers,MA).Proteinswerevisualizedandimages capturedusingachemiluminescentdetectionkit(GEHealthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) and a digital imager (Azure c600, Azure biosystems, Dublin, CA).

To account for loading errors, each sample band was normalized to the total amount of protein in the gel lane of the respective sample.Additionally, each sample was normalized to a positive control that was loaded onto each gel to account for inter- gelvariation.Statistical analyses Net area under the response curve (AUC) was calculated as total AUC minus negative peak areas (i.e., area under baseline), using the trapezoidal method with commercially available software (GraphPad Prism, v.4).Data analysis was performed using mixed procedures in SAS 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute,Cary,NC)withsigniﬁcanceconsideredat P≤0.05and trendsconsideredwhen0.05 <P≤0.10.
Screening data (Table1) was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA to assess eﬀects of insulin status (i.e., ID vs. non-ID, “INSstatus”) between the horse groups at the start of the study.Insulinstatuswasmodeledastheﬁxedeﬀect.Variables measured over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with appropriate variance-covariance structures chosen for each variable based on lowest AICC ﬁt statistics, and the kr2 adjustment for degrees of freedom.Insulin status (i.e., ID vs.non-ID), treatment (i.e., protein source; “Treat”), time, and their interactions were considered ﬁxed eﬀects.Baseline values for each variable were included as a covariate in the model.Block and treatment sequence (i.e., which treatment pellet was received ﬁrst) were considered random factors in the model with “horse∗sample period” as the error term.Time was considered the repeated measure with horse nested in period as the subject.
Diﬀerences between ﬁxed eﬀects for all other variables were analyzed by ANOVA with insulin status, treatment and their interactions considered as ﬁxed eﬀects and block, sequence, and sample period as the random eﬀects. Data for horses that did not consume their treatment meal within 60min were removed fromthe ﬁnal data set.This resulted in n=6 andn=8 replicates for the alfalfa treatment for ID and non-ID horses, respectively.All horses Frontiersin VeterinaryScience /zero.tnum/five.tnum frontiersin.org Loos et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fvets./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./eight.tnum/nine.tnum/six.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnum TABLE /four.tnum Body weight and BCS at thestart and end of the study in ID and non-ID horses.

Heterogeneity of variance was assessed for each response variable by evaluating the AICC criterion that resulted from alternately setting the “group” option within the repeated statement equal to each of the main eﬀects and their interaction and without a “group” speciﬁcation to test homogeneous variance models. In each case, the model with the smallest AICC value was chosen as the best-ﬁt model, resulting in deﬁning either “insulin status” or “treatment pellet” as the source of heterogeneity in the covariance structure.Studentized residuals for all response variables were evaluated graphically (using Q/Q plots) and with the SAS univariate procedures to ensure adherence to normality assumptions.Due to non- normal distribution of the studentized residuals, glucose data werelog-transformedforanalysis.Outlierswereidentiﬁedfrom studentized residuals >3 SD from the mean and were removed from the data set where appropriate.
All data are presented as leastsquaremeansandstandarderrorofthemean. Results Body weight and BCS ID horses had a higher BCS compared to non-ID horses ( P <0.0001), but BW was not diﬀerent between groups ( P=0.40, Table4).BW and BCS did not change throughout the study ( P ≥0.75,Table4).Treatment pellet intake Sugar,starch,andCPintakewassimilarwithbothtreatment meals providing 0.04g sugar, 0.06g starch and 0.25g CP/kg BW/meal (Table3).To provide similar amounts of CP, the average meal size was 0.9 and 0.4g per kg of BW for alfalfa and protein supplement pellets, respectively.Consequently, meal consumption time for alfalfa pellets was greater (17 ±1.27min, P<0.0001) than that for the protein supplement (4.62 ±1.15min).There was a treatment by insulin status interaction on meal consumption times ( P=0.01,Table5).

Levels of mTOR-P and rpS6-P were increased over baseline values at all biopsy time points after consumption of alfalfa pellets (P≤0.09). Consumption of the protein supplement signiﬁcantly increased mTOR-P at 90min ( P=0.003,Figure3) but levels returned to basal values by 180min ( P=0.16) and were slightly lower than baseline values at 300min ( P =0.07).Postprandial abundance of rpS6-P was increased over basal levels at 90 ( P=0.002,Figure4) and 180min (P=0.01) but returned to baseline by 300min ( P= 0.43) with consumption of the protein supplement.There was no diﬀerence in mTOR-P or rpS6-P abundance between treatments at baseline ( P≥0.19), but mTOR ( P=0.08) and rpS6 ( P=0.10) activation tended to be ∼1.5-fold greater after consumption of the protein supplement at 90min compared to eating alfalfa pellets.By 180min there were no diﬀerences in mTOR-P ( P=0.79) or rpS6-P ( P=0.16) levels between protein sources.

The main regulator of MPS is the mTOR pathway, which is activated by amino acids and insulin following a protein-rich meal (12). Activation of the mTOR protein kinase leads to phosphorylation/activation of several key downstream eﬀectors which regulate protein translation initiation and elongation (4).It has been extensively shown in humans and rodents that degree of mTOR activation and subsequent rate of MPS are sensitive to level of protein intake and type of protein source consumed (8, 27, 28) .Ingestion of increasing amounts of protein typically results in dose-dependent stimulation of muscle protein synthetic pathways (29).We have recently illustrated this concept in horses, with maximal phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream eﬀectors reached at ∼0.25g crude protein (CP)/kg BW.Secondly, the digestibility and amino acid proﬁle (i.e.,protein “quality”) of the protein source has been shown to diﬀerentially aﬀect muscle anabolic pathways in other species (30).
More rapidly digested protein will generally provide a stronger stimulus for MPS, attributed to a faster, more substantial increase in circulating essential AA (EAA) (25). The objective of the current study was to test this concept in horses, comparing two protein sources of diﬀerent quality (i.e., AA proﬁle and digestibility) commonly used in equine diets.We therefore chose a commercially available high protein pelleted feedsupplement(soy,alfalfa,potatoproteinmix)andacustom- made alfalfa pellet.Both sources were fed at an equal level of CP previously established to result in near-maximal degree of mTOR protein phosphorylation in horses (11).It should be notedthatforthetwotreatmentpelletstosupplyequalamounts of CP alfalfa pellets were fed in a larger quantity.Consequently, consumption of the alfalfa treatment meal took longer than the proteinsupplement.
Legumes, such as alfalfa typically contain a higher amount of soluble protein compared to grasses, making them an overall higher quality forage source for horses with elevated nutritional needs. However, prececal alfalfa protein digestibility in horses is still reported to be ∼2×lower than that of higher quality protein sources such as soybean meal (31, 32).Although digestibilitywasnotmeasuredinthisstudy,itwasassumedthat AA bioavailability of the commercial protein supplement (i.e., soybean meal, alfalfa meal, potato protein) would be greater than the forage-associated protein (i.e., alfalfa).In line with this hypothesis, there was a rise in both plasma EAA and non- EAA concentrations following ingestion of both dietary protein sources, but the relative increase in plasma AA was greater following ingestion of the protein supplement compared to the alfalfa pellets.
These results are similar to a previous study were plasmaconcentrationsofseveralEAAweregreaterwhenhorses receivedaconcentratemeal(mainproteinsource:soybeanmeal) comparedtoanisonitrogenousamountofproteincomingfrom long stem grass hay (10). Likewise, we observed higher peak plasmaEAAconcentrationswhichwasreached ∼2hfasterwhen horsesconsumedtheproteinsupplementcomparedtothealfalfa pellets, suggesting faster protein digestion, absorption, and/or release of EAA into circulation.Of all EAA, leucine is known to potently activate the mTOR pathway and protein translation initiation in human and animal species, including horses (33– 35).Thepostprandialplasmaleucineresponsefollowedasimilar trendtothatoftheEAA,withagreaterpeakandshortertimeto reach peak following consumption of the protein supplement.Interestingly, plasma EAA concentrations did not return to baseline values until 7–8h post feeding.
Similar results were seen in previous studies in horses receiving a protein-rich meal (10, 23), although the amount of CP/kg BW was signiﬁcantly lower in this study. A similar time course for release of AA into circulationovera5–7.5hperiodpostfeedinghasbeendescribed forhighqualityproteinsourcessuchaswhey,caseinandmilkin humans(25).Frontiersin VeterinaryScience /one.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.org Loos et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fvets./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./eight.tnum/nine.tnum/six.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnum There was a modest elevation in plasma glucose concentrations post feeding, but this was not diﬀerent between protein sources, indicating that the formulation of both pellets to deliver equal amounts of sugar and starch was successful.In synergy with an increase in plasma glucose, the inﬂux of AA lead to a signiﬁcant increase in plasma insulin concentrations after consumption of both protein treatments.
The insulinotropic eﬀect of AA has been well-documented (36), and it was noticeable that consumption of the protein supplement resulted in numerically higher and faster peak plasma insulin levels compared to consumption of alfalfa pellets. With non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) levels kept consistent between protein sources, a greater increase in plasma AA concentrations was expected to have a more potent stimulatory eﬀect on pancreatic insulin release.This has been documented in human studies, where consumption of “faster” digested proteins or free amino acids resulted in greater elevation of blood insulin concentrations compared to “slower” digested proteins (7, 37).To the best of our knowledge no studies exist to date comparing insulin responses to diﬀerent isolated protein sources in horses, however, higher insulin responses were observed after nasogastric intubation with a glucose+leucine bolus vs.a glucose +whey protein bolus in thoroughbred horses (38).
Additionally, horses consuming forages higher in CP had a more elevated postprandial insulin response compared to consumption of forages with lower CP (39, 40). These data suggest that protein quality certainly has the potential to impact the postprandial insulin responses and subsequentanabolicresponsetoaprotein-richmealinhorses.As expected, the rapid and more pronounced hyperaminoacidemia following consumption of the higher quality protein supplement provided a stronger anabolic signal to the muscle, resulting in a trend toward greater abundance of phosphorylated mTOR and rpS6 proteins 90min post feeding compared to alfalfa pellets.This is in line with studies in other species, where “fast” digestible proteins have a greater stimulatory eﬀect on mTOR pathway protein activation and subsequent MPS compared to equal amounts of “slow” digestible proteins (7, 8, 41, 42) .
It should be noted that most of these studies compared animal to plant-based protein sources and there is still a paucity of data regarding the impact of diﬀerent plant-based protein sources on mTOR and MPS, in particular as it pertains to herbivore diets. The observed diﬀerential eﬀect of the protein sources on mTOR pathway stimulation is likely attributed to diﬀerences in leucine content andpostprandialleucinemia,aconceptthathasbeenextensively shown in humans and other animal species (43–46).Analysis of the treatment pellets conﬁrmed that the protein supplement had an overall superior EAA proﬁle (Table3), providing 61 and 80mg of lysine and leucine per gram of CP (DM), respectively, compared to 38 and 60mg for the alfalfa pellets.The higher leucine content of the protein supplement led to greater peak in plasma leucine concentrations and thus likely contributedto greater postprandial mTOR pathway activation.
Although the inherent insulinotropic nature of certain AA prevents distinction between the stimulatory eﬀect of insulin and AA, there was no statistical diﬀerence in the postprandial plasma insulin response between protein sources. Conversely, plasma EAA and leucine concentrations were signiﬁcantly higher after consumption of the protein supplement compared to the alfalfa pellets.Previous work has suggested that the role of insulin in the activation of the mTOR pathway is suggested to be primarily permissive, with leucine proven to be the main driver of EAA-induced stimulation of mTOR and subsequent MPS(35, 47).In further support of this, peak mTOR and rpS6 activation in the current study were more correlated with plasma EAA and leucine concentrations with little to no relationship to plasma insulin concentrations.
This suggests that the diﬀerential eﬀect of protein source on mTOR pathway activation in the current study was primarily attributed to diﬀerences in EAA proﬁle and absorption kinetics. While we did not measure rates of MPS, it is widely accepted that an increase in MPS coincides with phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream eﬀectors (4, 48, 49) and that greater rates of MPS is concomitant with higher degree of phosphorylation of mTORsignalingproteins (8,43,46) .Itisthereforereasonableto assumethatgreatermTORpathwayactivationfollowingprotein supplementingestionwouldbereﬂectedbyhigherratesofMPS inthesehorses.Diﬀerences in mTOR pathway activation between protein sources was most evident 90min post feeding.To the best of ourknowledge,thisstudyistheﬁrsttoevaluatethepostprandial temporalchangesinphosphorylationpatternsofmuscleprotein synthetic pathways in horses.Regardless of protein source, there was a postprandial increase in the phosphorylation of mTOR pathway components.
Peak activation was reached approximately 90min post feeding, at which point protein phosphorylation was increased 2.0 and 4.8-fold from baseline formTORandrpS6,respectively.Thistimelineisinaccordance withreportsinhumans,pigs,androdentswherepeakactivation of muscle signaling proteins was observed around 30–90min following a protein meal (8, 48, 50) . Interestingly, in addition to a greater extend of activation, phosphorylation levels of mTOR and rpS6 declined more rapidly after consumption of the protein supplement, by 180 and 300min, respectively, while they remained higher than baseline levels up until 300min after ingestionofthealfalfapellets.Itcouldbespeculatedthatamore sustained activation of the mTOR pathway after eating alfalfa pellets could be due to longer consumption times and slower digestion which might have resulted in more gradual release of EAA into circulation.Indeed, plasma EAA concentrations only reached peak 4h after consumption of alfalfa pellet.
Prolonged activation of mTOR is typically associated with continued elevation of plasma leucine concentrations (3, 8, 48). However, while plasma leucine concentrations were higher than basal levels at 180min, they returned to basal levels by 300min Frontiersin VeterinaryScience /one.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org Loos et al./one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fvets./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./eight.tnum/nine.tnum/six.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnum for both treatments.Furthermore, leucine concentrations were higher for the protein pellet compared to alfalfa pellet at 180min.Without a diﬀerence in insulin concentrations at these time points, this suggests that prolonged phosphorylation of mTOR signaling proteins with alfalfa consumption cannot solely be attributed to circulating plasma leucine or insulin concentrations.A more likely explanation would be treatment diﬀerences in cellular feedback mechanisms.
In contrast to the well-deﬁned signaling cascade leading to an increase in mTOR pathway activation and MPS, the cellular processes involved in protein dephosphorylation and decline in MPS are less well-understood. Through negative feedback loops, protein phosphatases play an important role in balancing kinase-driven phosphorylation events, thereby regulating protein translation andcellgrowth (51,52).Similartokinaseactivity,itislikelysuch phosphatases are sensitive to extend of the anabolic input.For example, excess amino acid inﬂux has shown to cause a strong increase in the S6K1-mediated negative feedback loop, thereby regulating cellular signal transduction (53).It is therefore reasonable to assume that hyperactivation of mTOR and rpS6 90min following consumption of the protein supplement could haveresultedinagreaternegativefeedbackresponse viaprotein phosphatases and faster protein dephosphorylation compared to alfalfa pellets.
Whether more sustained submaximal mTOR activation has physiological relevance with regards to MPS is debatable and seems to be dependent on protein source. By use of intrinsically labeled protein, a recent study in humans elegantly illustrated that sustained aminoacidemia following consumption of slower digesting, mixed protein meal stimulated mTOR phosphorylation and MPS for up to 5h (49).However, this study made no comparison with a faster digested protein meal.In fact, when the eﬀect of gradual and prolongedaminoacidemiaiscomparedtorapidandpronounced hyperaminoacidemia,itisevidentthatthelaterresultsingreater rpS6 phosphorylation and higher overall rates of MPS (43).These data are line with observations in the current study and suggests that the pattern of postprandial aminoacidemia, rather than net AA exposure or total protein consumption is the main determinant for the degree of muscle protein accretion.
Furtherresearchisneededtodeterminethelong-termimpactof diﬀerentproteinsourcesonmusclemassdevelopmentinhorses. As expected, horses with insulin dysregulation (ID) had greater postprandial plasma insulin responses to both protein sources, compared to non-ID horses.Although the matrix of the pellets supplied minor amounts of NSC, there was no diﬀerence in the plasma glucose response between the horse groups, implying that the exacerbated insulin surge in ID horses occurred in response to dietary AA.The precise mechanisms for postprandial hyperinsulinemia in horses are not fully understood but may involve alterations in pancreatic sensitivitytonutrientsandincretinsorreducedinsulinclearance rates(54).A similar response was observed in a previous study where ID horses had a 9-fold greater insulin responseto a large protein meal (1.2g CP/kg BW) compared to that of their non-ID counterparts (23).
While we only provided a ﬁfth (i.e., 0.25g CP/kg BW) of the protein amount used in the previous study, we still observed signiﬁcant elevation in plasma insulin concentrations in ID horses. Average peak plasma insulin concentrations for both protein sources were ∼100 and 30 µIU/mL for the ID compared to the non-ID horses, respectively.Although a signiﬁcantly greater plasma insulin response to the higher quality protein supplement was anticipated, hyperinsulinemia following consumption of the alfalfa pellet was unexpected.Peak concentrations were 95µIU/mL in ID horses 1h post feeding, levels that would commonly be considered as postprandial hyperinsulinemia.While alfalfa is sometimes favored for its lower NSC content in comparison to many grasses, these data indicate that protein levels should also be carefully evaluated when selecting forages forhorsessensitivetoID.
The overall plasma amino acid response to both protein treatments was similar between horse groups, indicating digestion and absorption kinetics as well as amino acid removal from circulation (i.e., disposal or uptake into tissues) did not seem to be signiﬁcantly altered by insulin status. ID horses did tend to have slightly higher peak leucine and non-EAA concentrations and AA clearance rates from circulation seemed to be somewhat delayed, which is in accordance to our previous study(23).There is still a paucity of data on postprandial AA responses in hyperinsulinemic individuals, but it is plausible that underlying insulin resistance (IR) could aﬀect amino acid metabolismoruptakeintotissues.There were no diﬀerences in the degree of phosphorylation of mTOR and rpS6 between the ID and non-ID groups for either protein source, indicating that AA uptake by the muscle and subsequent mTOR pathway activation in response to a protein meal was not impaired in ID horses.
These data are in accordancewithpreviousworkinhorsesusingaglucocorticoid- induced model of IR where mTOR pathway activation in responsetoaproteinmealwasnotdiﬀerentfromhealthycontrol horsesdespiteclearevidenceofIR (55).Thisstudyextendsthese ﬁndingsinhorseswithnaturallyoccurringID.IRinhumansand rodentshasbeenassociatedwithanabolicresistanceandmuscle wasting(56). However, in most instances of human diabetes, insuﬃcient inhibition of protein breakdown by general absence of insulin is the primary cause for increased net loss of muscle protein(57, 58).In contrast, equine ID is rarely associated withinsuﬃcientinsulinreleasebutratherexcessivepostprandial hyperinsulinemia.While we did not assess peripheral tissue IR in this study, the same animals were used in an immediate follow-up project (59)where insulin sensitivity, as assessed by a combined glucose-insulin tolerance test, was shown to be reduced in this set of ID horses.
A few other studies have illustratedalterationsinGLUT-4expressionandGSKactivation in muscle of IR horses, however, it should be noted that these signaling events occur upstream of mTOR and are under direct Frontiersin VeterinaryScience /one.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org Loos et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fvets./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./eight.tnum/nine.tnum/six.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnum inﬂuence of insulin mediated signal transduction.Moreover, it is known that insulin facilitates, but is not required for AA- mediatedmTORpathwaystimulation (12).OralAAintake,and in particular leucine, can increase phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream eﬀectors 4E-BP-1 and S6K1 viaRheb-Ras proteins, and this response is maintained in skeletal muscle of diabetic rodents (47).
Further research is needed to determine whether equine ID aﬀects insulin signal transduction upstream of mTOR or prevents inhibition of proteolytic pathways which could potentially lead to muscle wasting over time. However, it canbeconcludedfromthecurrentdatathatIDdoesnotprevent muscle mTOR and downstream rpS6 activation by dietary AA inhorses.Regardless of treatment, ID horses had overall higher levels of phosphorylated rpS6.A similar response was observed post feeding a protein meal in glucocorticoid-induced IR horses (55).Considering ID horses tended to have slightly higher peak plasma leucine concentrations, thismay haveprovided stronger stimulationofS6K1andsubsequentlyrpS6asithasbeenshown that leucine can also directly increase S6K phosphorylation downstreamofmTOR (44).Alternatively,studiesinrodentsand humanshaveillustratedthatS6K1,playsarolethedevelopment of cellular insulin resistance.
Hyperactivation of S6K1 under nutrient abundancy has shown to initiate a negative feedback loop leading to decreased cellular insulin signal transduction (53).AlthoughwedidnotmeasureS6K1activity,itistheprotein kinase directly responsible for rpS6 activation. It is therefore reasonabletoassumeelevatedrpS6phosphorylationlevelscould bereﬂectiveofahyperactiveS6K1inIDhorses.Inconclusion,thecurrentstudyistheﬁrstinhorsestoshow the time course of postprandial skeletal muscle mTOR pathway activation and compare the impact of dietary protein source on degree of activation of mTOR signaling proteins.We show that protein supplementation increases muscle mTOR pathway activation and that the maximal degree of phosphorylation of mTOR and rpS6 proteins occurs at ∼90min post-feeding withasubsequentdephosphorylationofthesesignalingproteins over a 5h period.
Additionally, we show that the consumption of a protein supplement containing a mixture of higher quality protein sources, tended to result in greater postprandial phosphorylationofmTORandrpS6proteinscomparedtoequal amounts of crude protein from a forage-based protein source.
