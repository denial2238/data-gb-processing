Objective: To evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of T2D in a general popula-tion of older US adults. Design: The Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL) is a completed ﬁve-yearrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2x2 supple- mentation trial of vitamin D 3(cholecalciferol; 2000 IU per day) and omega-3 fatty acids (1 g per day) for the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease.VITAL-T2D, a pre-speci ﬁed ancillary study initiated prior to trial enrollment, tested the ef ﬁcacy of vitamin D supple- mentation on incident T2D risk.We also conducted apre-registered systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of vitamin D trials ( ≥1000 IU/d cholecalciferol) re- porting effects on T2D risk.Participants: We analyzed 22,220 VITAL participants without T2D at baseline in2011-2014.Mean age and body mass index (BMI) were67.2 years (SD =7.1) and 27.5 kg/m 2(SD=5.3), respectively, with 51% female and 17% African American.
In addition,we analyzed change in glycemic traits at 2 years in a subco-hort of 918 participants attending in-person clinic visits.Results: The cumulative incidence of T2D at median follow-up of 5.3 years was 3.98 cases/1000 PY among thevitamin D group and 4.37 cases/1000 person years (PY)for placebo (intention-to-treat hazard ratio [HR] =0.91 [0.76, 1.09]). Results were not signi ﬁcantly modi ﬁed by age, sex, race, BMI, or baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.In a meta-analysis of three eligible randomized trials(N=25,154 participants), the relative risk (RR) for T2D with vitamin D vs.placebo was 0.89 (0.80, 1.00); p =0.049.In a meta-analysis the RR was 0.75 (0.60, 0.94) among par-ticipants with BMI <30 kg/ m 2at baseline, but was 0.99 (0.84, 1.17 among those with obesity (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2) (p-interaction =0.19).There were minimal effects of vitamin D vs.placebo on glycemic traits in the clinic subcohort over-all.
In analyses stratifying by baseline BMI, we observed in-creased HOMA- βand insulin response during oral glucose challenge at 2y for BMI <30 kg/m 2with vitamin D vs. pla- cebo, but no bene ﬁt for participants with obesity.We did not observe effect modi ﬁcation by other variables.Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation of 2000 IU/d did not signi ﬁcantly reduce T2D risk in a general popula- tion of US adults, but the updated meta-analysis supportspotential bene ﬁts among adults without obesity.Trial and Systematic Review Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01169259 and NCT01633177; PROSPERO: CRD42019147562.Presentation: 6/1/2024 1Brigham and Women ’s Hospital, Boston, MA;2Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, CAJournal of the Endocrine Society | https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvae163 | A521 J Endocrine Soc, Volume 8, Issue Supplement_1, October –November 2024 A521
