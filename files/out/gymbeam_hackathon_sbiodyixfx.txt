Adiposity and pathogen exposure: An investigation of response to iron supplementation and hypothesized predictors in anemic pre-school-aged children living in a dual burden environment Achsah F.Dorseya, Mary E.Pennyb, Amanda L.Thompsonc aDepartment of Anthropology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA bInstituto de Investigación Nutricional, La Molina, Lima, Perú cDepartment of Anthropology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA Abstract Objectives: Peruvians are experiencing rapid dietary and lifestyle changes, resulting in a phenomenon known as the ‘dual burden of disease.’ A common manifestation of the dual burden in individuals is the co-occurrence of overweight and anemia.Despite recent initiatives introduced to address these concerns, rates continue to be public health concerns.
This study investigates the relationship between immune activation and lack of response to iron supplementation after one month of treatment and explores variation in body fat stores as a potential moderator between immune function and response to treatment. Methods: Data come from children, aged 2-5 years (n=50) from a peri-urban community in Lima, Peru.Multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between response to treatment (Hb>=11.0 g/dL) after 1 month of treatment), markers of immune activation (C-reactive protein and reported morbidity symptoms), and measures of body fat (waist-to-height ratio, triceps skinfold thickness, and body mass index).Results: We found that high CRP is associated with a lack of response to iron supplementation after one month of treatment and that BMI z-score may moderate this association.
Generally, larger body size is associated with response to iron supplementation whether or not the children in this sample have high immune activation. However, the probability of anemic children responding to iron supplementation treatment differed across adiposity measures.Conclusions: Our finding suggesting that adiposity and C-reactive protein influence response to iron supplementation, furthers our understanding of the relationship between inflammation and anemia treatment in children and has both theoretical and public health implications.Correspondence: Achsah Dorsey, Department of Anthropology, University of Massachusetts, 240 Hicks Way #217, Amherst, MA 01003, adorsey@umass.edu.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS AD designed the study, collected and analyzed the data, and drafted the manuscript.AT and MP played an active role in designing the study.AT assisted with data analyses, and provided critical comments on and suggestions for the manuscript.

Due to concerns about anemia’s negative impact on child development and because the majority of anemia cases are attributed to iron deficiency ( Stoltzfus et al. 2004 ), global health institutions recommend iron supplementation and fortification of all children in populations with a high prevalence of anemia ( World Health Organization [WHO] 2002 ; Stolzfus and Dreyfuss 1998 ).Supplementation and fortification have been proven to be effective public health interventions to reduce anemia rates ( Thompson et al.2013 ; Zimmermann and Hurrell 2007 ; Baltussen et al.2004 ), even though not all anemia is iron-responsive.A comprehensive review of the efficacy of iron supplementation concluded that the majority of randomized-control-trials investigating the effectiveness of iron supplementation in children report significant increases in Hb concentration and other iron status indicators as well as reduced anemia prevalence ( Iannotti et al.2006 ).
Despite the reported benefits of iron supplementation, public health officials have raised concerns about the risks associated with iron supplementation among preschoolers. Several systematic reviews of randomized, controlled trials of iron supplementation conclude that supplementation moderately increases the risk of diarrheal disease ( Gera and Sachdev 2002 ) and malaria ( Oppenheimer 2001 ).One explanation for these negative effects of iron supplementation comes from the field of evolutionary medicine, which proposes that some manifestations of disease may act as adaptive defenses against other types of disease ( Ewald 1994 , Williams and Nesse 1991 ).Infection with common pathogens has been linked to higher C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory acute-phase protein ( Ballou and Kushner 1992 ) commonly used as a marker of systemic inflammation levels in children ( Dowd et al.2010 ) and adults ( Nazmi et al.2010 ; Zhu et al.
2000 ), with greater risk of inflammation seen with increasing pathogen burden ( Rousham et al. 1998 ).Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection and signals biological systems to induce the production of hepcidin.This liver-derived hormone reduces plasma iron concentration through iron sequestration, declining iron absorption, and limiting erythropoiesis (the production of red blood cells), resulting in anemia ( Weiss et al.2019 ; Ganz and Nemeth 2015 ; Weinberg 1992 ).Decreasing the amount of circulating iron and iron absorption restricts the availability of iron to pathogens, inhibiting pathogen growth, proliferation, and virulence ( Nemeth and Ganz 2006 ).In areas with high infectious disease burdens, anemia may be beneficial, despite its negative impacts on child growth and cognitive development, since it reduces bacteria proliferation and virulence ( Wander et al.2009 ).Dorsey et al.Page 2 Am J Phys Anthropol .
Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Research suggests that along with chronic pathogen exposure, high levels of adiposity also activate pro-inflammatory pathways ( McDade et al.2008a ; Thompson et al.2014w , Vahdat et al.2012 ); thus, overweight and obesity may also influence the efficacy of iron supplementation programs.In countries undergoing rapid dietary and lifestyle changes, obesity exists alongside illnesses associated with undernutrition, a phenomenon known as the ‘dual burden of disease’ ( Popkin, Adair, Ng 2012 ).A common manifestation of the dual burden in individuals is the co-occurrence of overweight and anemia.The co-occurrence between the two is attributed to increased iron requirements among overweight individuals (Yanoff et al.
2007 ) or physiological changes associated with overweight that influence iron absorption and utilization, such as an increase of inflammatory acute-phase proteins, like CRP ( Cheng et al. 2012 ).High levels of these proteins cause inflammation, triggering an innate immune response and increasing risk for anemia due to iron sequestration and reduced iron absorption.Evidence for the association between overweight and anemia has been mixed.Some studies report that high body mass index (BMI) results in increased risk for iron deficiency and anemia among children and adolescents in both high income and transitioning settings (Aberli et al.2011; Eftekhari et al.2009 ; Zimmermann et al.2008 ; Nead et al.2004 ).Other studies have observed lower rates of anemia in women and children experiencing overnutrition (Kroker-Lobos et al.2011; Eckhardt et al.2008 ).Similarly, findings on the association between overweight and obesity and response to iron supplementation have been mixed.
South African children with high BMI-for-age-z-scores had a greater risk for remaining iron-deficient after iron supplementation for 8.5 months when compared to children with low BMI-for-age-z-scores ( Baumgartner et al., 2013 ). Conversely, overweight and obese children were shown to have a reduced response to oral iron treatment in a recent review ( Hutchinson 2016 ).These contradictory findings may be due to a complex set of environmental and individual differences in disease exposure and immune activation in varying economic and cultural contexts.Additionally, while BMI has traditionally been used as a proxy for body fat (Albrecht et al.2014), other anthropometric measures of over-nutrition, like waist circumference, may provide greater insight into the relationship between adiposity and anemia due to differences in in the production of inflammatory cytokines by visceral vs.subcutaneous fat tissue (Hamdy, Porramatikulm, and Al-Ozairi 2006).
Investigating iron supplementation in children from an evolutionary medicine perspective within a dual burden context is important because of their high exposure to pathogens and energetic demands for growth and immune function. While life history theory (LHT) offers a framework for investigating the benefits and risks of anemia, as energy devoted to immune defense can’t be allocated to growth and development ( Stearns 1992 ; Charnov 1993 ), this framework does not address the increasing rates in overweight and obesity.Traditionally, LHT presents the trade-off between allocating limited resources to immune defense or growth differs for those living in energy-rich environments versus those living in energy-poor contexts, suggesting that children with reliable access to nutrients are able to replenish the costs of immune activation while children experiencing undernutrition have more limited energy to devote to growth and consequently exhibit impaired immunity (McDade et al.2008b ).
However, the simple comparison between energy-rich and energy­Dorsey et al. Page 3 Am J Phys Anthropol .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 01.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript poor environments is challenged by a global rise in overnutrition and urbanization, resulting in the dual burden of disease.While fat represents stored energy that is utilized for metabolic processes associated with growth and immune function ( Kuzawa 1998 ), high body weight and BMI have been associated with chronic inflammation in adults and children ( Thompson et al.2014 ; Choi et al.2013 ; Dowd et al.2010 ).The association between central adiposity and pro-inflammatory markers may be particularly strong in younger populations ( Fransson et al.2010 ; Nguyen et al.2009 ), suggesting that high energy stores (in the form of visceral body fat) may not always be beneficial.
Peru provides an important setting to study the efficacy of iron supplementation on child anemia status within a dual burden context. Peru has experienced rapid urbanization and economic growth since 1990, which has created unplanned communities surrounding urban areas.These communities are characterized by poor quality or informal housing, unhealthy living conditions, and poverty, resulting in greater exposure to risk factors and negative health outcomes.Estimates predict half of all pre-school age children suffer from anemia in Peru ( WHO 2009 ) and, despite the aforementioned interventions, anemia continues to represent a distinct challenge, even for those living near the city of Lima who have greater access to urban infrastructure.At the same time, urbanization and economic growth have contributed to a nutrition transition within urban areas ( Chaparro and Estrada 2012 ) leading to high rates of both undernutrition and overweight and obesity.
While the national prevalence of childhood overweight was 6.8% in 2015, recent evidence suggests that communities at sea-level have the highest rates of child overweight (45.5%) when compared to Andean or Amazonian regions (8.9% and 23.0%, respectively) ( Santos et al. 2019 ) and the department of Lima, which contains the nation’s capital, had one of the highest rates of childhood overweight and obesity ( Torres-Roman et al.2018 ).Due to the recent development of obesogenic environments, current efforts to combat anemia and high exposure to disease, unplanned urban communities in Peru provide a prime setting to explore the dual burden using an evolutionary medicine perspective.This study uses data collected from anemic pre-school-aged children (2-5 years old) receiving iron supplementation and living in the peri-urban community of San Juan de Lurigancho to test two hypotheses (Figure 1).
Since pathogen exposure leads to iron sequestration and reduced iron absorption through the innate immune response, we hypothesize that high immune activation will be associated with a lack of response to iron supplementation after one month of treatment. Based on previous research suggesting that adiposity activates pro-inflammatory pathways, we propose that variation in body fat stores will moderate the association between immune function and response to treatment.We expect a reduced probability of response to iron supplementation in children with immune activation and higher adiposity when compared to children with immune activation and lower adiposity (Figure 2).METHODS Study Design The primary investigator conducted research in three neighborhoods within San Juan de Lurigancho, one of the poorest districts within metropolitan Lima.This district northeast of Dorsey et al.Page 4 Am J Phys Anthropol .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript the city center has been the site of numerous anemia interventions to date. In 2013, 35.7% of children under five living in this district were diagnosed with anemia.Despite the efforts of the Ministry of Health and community-based organizations, this percentage had increased to 41.9% in 2014 ( Ministerio de Salud 2015 ).San Juan de Lurigancho also has the highest rates of chronic malnutrition (8.6%) and overweight (11.0%) in pre-school-aged children compared to other low-income districts around Lima ( Navarrete Mejía et al.2016 ).Data were collected from November 2017 to July 2018 and included an initial survey and anemia testing and a follow-up interview after one month of prescribed ferrous-sulfate treatment for each participant.Baseline surveys included demographic and socio-economic data, along with anthropometric measurements and dried blood spot samples from anemic pre-school-aged children.
If the child was anemic, a physician met with the caregiver-child dyad and prescribed treatment, one tablespoon of ferrous-sulfate syrup twice a day (totaling 15 mg of iron) for one month (T. Herrera Acuña [IIN pediatrician], personal communication, January 29, 2018).Follow-up survey data, anthropometrics measurements, and a second finger prick blood sample were collected one month later to assess response to iron supplementation.The study field coordinator and first author recruited 86 caregivers (typically mothers) and 102 children (aged 2-5 years) living within the San Juan de Lurigancho district through door-to-door and “snowball” sampling ( Bernard 2011 ) for the initial survey.Any children who were currently on or had taken antibiotics more than once in the previous two weeks were excluded from the study.Half (n=51) of the children who participated in initial testing were anemic (Hb <11.0 g/dL) and were included in the follow-up interview one month after starting treatment.
Complete baseline data were available for the 51 anemic children and follow-up data were available for 50, because one participating dyad moved to another district during data collection. This participant is not included in any of the analyses below.This research protocol received both University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill IRB and Instituto de Investigación Nutricional Ethics Board approval for this project.Parental consent and child assent were obtained prior to enrollment in the study.Data Collection Primary caregivers provided information on household demographics and child morbidity symptoms.Standard procedures ( Lohman et al.1988 ) were implemented to collect anthropometric measurements at the baseline and follow up visits.Standing height was measured to the nearest 0.01cm using a portable stadiometer (Seca #213).Weight was measured using a portable electronic floor scale (Seca #803), with the child in light clothing and without footwear.
Waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.01cm with non­ elastic tape midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest. Tricep skinfold thickness (TSF) was measured to the nearest 0.5mm with precision Lange calipers.During both the baseline and follow-up interviews, at least one drop of free-flowing capillary blood was collected for immediate Hb analysis via a minimally invasive finger prick and a portable photometer Hemocue machine (Hemocue Hb 201+, HemoCue America, California).The child’s finger was cleaned with alcohol and a sterile disposable microlancet was used to deliver a controlled puncture.A drop of whole blood was placed directly onto Dorsey et al.Page 5 Am J Phys Anthropol .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 01.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript the Hemocue cuvette and inserted into the Hemocue machine.Hb levels were estimated and recorded within 30 seconds of the finger prick.
Following this measurement, at least three drops of blood were collected for laboratory analysis of CRP on standardized filter paper (Whatman #903 Middlesex, UK), dried, and stored frozen at −20 C at the local health center in San Juan de Lurigancho until they were transported to the Human Biology Laboratory at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. There, the dried blood spot samples were analyzed for CRP using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol (Quantikine Human CRP Immunoassay, R&D Systems) and applying adaptations of validated methods for blood spot analysis ( McDade et al.2004 ), D’Cruz et al.2020 ).Samples were exposed to above-freezing temperatures for less than 24 hours, within the limits necessary to maintain sample integrity for CRP analysis (McDade et al.2004 ).To assess variation across assays during the analysis of samples, three control values were included on each plate.
Inter-assay coefficients of variation (SD/mean) for the low, medium, and high controls were 9.88%, 7.76%, and 13.54%, respectively. Additionally, we measured each sample in duplicate and the average intra-assay coefficient of variation for all samples was 6.24%.Study Variables Anemia: Hb concentration, the most common hematological assessment method used to measure anemia ( Chaparro and Suchdev 2019 ), was used as an objective measure of anemia status in this study.Hemoglobin (Hb) was measured to test for anemia and response to iron supplementation via a minimally invasive finger prick and a portable photometer Hemocue machine (Hemocue Hb 201+, HemoCue America, California).Anemia was categorized as a dichotomous variable (not-anemic ≥11.0g/dL and anemic <11.0g/dL) based on WHO recommendations (2016).
Children who became not anemic (Hb>=11.0 g/dL) after 1 month of treatment, the suggested length of iron supplementation by the Peruvian Ministry of Health ( Ministerio de Salud 2015 ), were categorized as responders while children whose Hb remained below 11.0 g/dL at the final test were categorized as non-responders. We used this definition of response because it was the preferred outcome of public health initiatives aimed at reducing childhood anemia.To test the sensitivity of our findings, we also explored two alternative definitions of response to iron supplementation (response defined categorically as an increase of 1g/dL Hb in four weeks and continuously as change in Hb from baseline to the final interview).Immune activation: Subjective and objective measures of child immune activation were assessed at both interviews.We collected child morbidity symptoms from caretakers as a subjective measure of health to establish current health and collect health histories.
Reported child morbidity indices are based on maternal reports of child illness within the two weeks prior to the initial and final interviews. The presence and absence of ‘common cold’ symptoms are based on reports of runny nose and/or cough.While data on reported cold symptoms were collected for both interviews, only final cold symptoms are tested here because previous analyses report evidence of a relationship between anemia status and the presence of cold symptoms only at the at the final interview in this sample ( Dorsey and Thompson 2020 ).Dorsey et al.Page 6 Am J Phys Anthropol .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 01.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript This study uses CRP as a direct measure of immune activation.We use a 2.2 mg/L cut-off value to define children with low versus high concentrations of CRP based on previous work ( Wander et al.2009 ; Caminiti et al.2016 ).
Only final CRP was included in analyses because CRP is an acute inflammatory marker that increases rapidly during inflammation but resolves quickly, therefore initial CRP may not have a strong influence on a child’s ability to respond to treatment one month later. The use of endpoint CRP in statistical models assumes that this reflects higher levels of inflammation during the previous weeks.The allostatic nature of iron regulation is supported by additional analyses of this sample (Dorsey and Thompson 2020 ) as well as in other studies ( Dorsey et al.2018 ; Hadley and DeCaro 2015 ).Adiposity: To measure child adiposity, we calculated several anthropometric measurements.Waist to height ratio (WHtR) was calculated by dividing the participant’s waist circumference in cm by height in cm.The child was categorized as having a high WHtR ratio if this ratio was ≥0.5 ( Ashwell and Hsieh 2005 ).
BMI and TSF z-scores were calculated based on the WHO standard using the WHO 2007 STATA macro package (de Onis et al. 2007 ).High and low measures were dichotomized using WHO suggested cut-points; children with a z-score >1 were categorized as having high measures of body fat.Data Analysis Bivariate logistic regression models were first used to assess the relationships between response to iron supplementation and immune activation and body size variables.To test the first hypothesis that immune activation is associated with reduced ability to respond to iron supplementation, we investigated whether elevated CRP was associated with the odds of responding to one month of iron supplementation in multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and season of data collection (a dichotomous variable based on the month in which the initial interview took place, summer (December-April) and winter (May-November)).
While previous work has demonstrated an association between summer and a reduced ability to respond iron supplementation in this sample ( Dorsey and Thompson 2020 ), there is a lack of evidence for a relationship between season and our alternative measures of response (p-values >0.25). Despite these contradictory results, we included the variable season as a covariate in multivariate models.To test the second hypothesis that body fat moderates the impact of immune activation on response to iron supplementation, we included several body fat variables in the multivariate logistic models developed in testing hypothesis one.Moderation was tested by including interaction terms between immune activation and body fat measures (>0.5 WHtR, >1.0 TSF z-score, and >1.0 BMI z-score) at the final interview.Finally, we conducted sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our findings to alternate specifications of adiposity.
We included BMI z-score as a continuous measure in these moderation models, but our anaylsis is limited by the small number of individuals with a BMI z-score below zero. Statistical analyses were conducted with STATA 13.In all logistic regression models, age, sex, and season were included as covariates and robust standard errors accounting for clustering by maternal identification to account for siblings were used.This process adjusts for siblings included in the sample and provides a more conservative estimate of Dorsey et al.Page 7 Am J Phys Anthropol .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 01.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript variance within the models.
Additionally, to test the robustness of our findings to alternate specifications of response to iron supplementation, we ran additional models with response defined categorically as an increase of 1g/dL Hb in four weeks and continuously as change in Hb from baseline to the final interview. RESULTS Sample characteristics On average, children’s Hb concentration increased by 0.86 g/dL from the initial to baseline visits.However, only 50% of children in this sample responded to 1-month of iron supplementation (Table 1).While adherence to iron supplementation treatment during the 4-week period ranged from 2 to 28 days (mean: 20.62, SD: 6.91), more than half of children in the sample received iron supplementation treatment for 22 days or more during the month of treatment.Children who responded to treatment were slightly older than non-responders and the majority of non-responders participated in the study during the summer months.
We found an association between season of the initial interview and response to iron supplementation in the bivariate models (OR:0.13, CI:0.03-0.53, p= 0.01). High WHtR and TSF z-score were common in the sample but a high BMI z-score was not, with only 28% of children having a BMI z-score >1.0.More than half of the sample experienced common cold symptoms two weeks prior to the final interview.Immune activation and response to supplementation We hypothesized that high immune activation at the final interview would be associated with a lack of response to iron supplementation after one month of treatment.We performed logistic regression models controlling for age, sex, and season to test the association between immune activation and response to treatment.Reported cold symptoms in the two weeks prior to the final visit were not associated with response to iron supplementation (OR: 0.40, CI: 0.09-1.77, p-value: 0.23) and were therefore excluded from further testing.
CRP at the final interview was associated with response to supplementation in logistic regression models (OR: 0.19, CI: 0.03-1.08, p-value <0.10). Children with high CRP levels at the final interview were less likely to respond to treatment compared to children with low CRP levels.The relationship between final CRP and response to treatment remained when response was defined as >1g/dL (OR: 0.33, CI: 0.09-1.19, p-value: 0.09) but not with continuous change in Hb (β: −0.28, CI: −0.91-0.36, p-value: 0.38).Adiposity as a moderator of immune activation and response to supplementation We hypothesized that variation in body fat stores would moderate the association between immune function and response to treatment and tested this hypothesis, first, by testing the main effects of adiposity measures on response using logistic regression models controlling for age, sex, and season.
As dichotomous variables, high WHtR (OR: 32.54, CI: 2.67-396.08, p-value: <0.05) and BMI z-score (OR: 3.76, CI: 0.96-14.79, p-value: <0.10) were associated with response to supplementation in logistic regression models. There was no difference between TSF z-score categories (OR: 1.04, CI: 0.27-4.02, p-value: 0.96) and response to treatment and was therefore not included in further testing.The association between adiposity measures and alternative definitions of response were not statistically Dorsey et al.Page 8 Am J Phys Anthropol .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 01.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript significant (p-values > 0.23).Similarly, we found no evidence for a direct relationship between continuous adiposity measures and continuous log CRP concentrations at the final interview (p-values > 0.27).
We found evidence that WHtR moderates the relationship between final CRP and response to supplementation (p-value <0.10) (Table 2). Anemic children with low CRP and high WHtR have the highest predicted probability of responding to supplementation (71%) (Figure 3).Children with low WHtR have a significantly lower chance of responding to iron supplementation than children with high WHtR, whether they are categorized as having low or high CRP values.Moderation could not be tested when response was defined as >1.0g/dL change in Hb because either one of the cells of the interaction term doesn’t have any cases or all the cases in that cell are associated with the same outcome.No significant effect of WHtR or the interaction term was found when Hb response was measured continuously (Table 2).BMI z-score also moderates the relationship between immune activation and response to treatment (p-value <0.05) (Table 3).
Children with high CRP and intermediate BMI z-scores have the lowest predicted probability of recovering from anemia (15%) while participants categorized as having high BMI z-scores with both high and low CRP after 1-month of treatment have a greater probability of responding to iron supplementation (Figure 4). Children categorized with both intermediate BMI z-score and low CRP values have a significantly higher chance of responding to treatment (55%) than children with intermediate BMI z-score but an elevated level of CRP (15%).In models with alternative definitions of response, no significant effects of BMI z-score or the interaction term were seen (Table 3).To more fully explore the different patterns seen between WHtR and response and BMI z-score and response, we tested their relationship to each other.
We found evidence for a positive weak association between WHtR and BMI z-score ( β: 0.28, p-value: 0.00) and BMI z-score and TSF z-score ( β: 0.27, p-value: 0.01), but a lack of evidence for a similar association between WHtR and TSF z-score ( β: −0.05, p-value: 0.67). Additionally, we explored BMI z-score as a continuous variable in moderation models.We expected a reduced probability of response to iron supplementation in children with high immune activation and increasing adiposity when compared to children with low immune activation and decreasing adiposity (Figure 2).We found a greater difference in the probability of responding to one month of ferrous sulfate syrup between children with low and high immune activation when BMI z-scores fall below the mean (Figure 5).When BMI z-score is greater than 1, the chance of responding to treatment is no longer significantly different between children with low and high final CRP.
DISCUSSION This study focuses on the associations between response to iron supplementation, inflammation, and adiposity among pre-school-aged children in a marginalized population located in Lima, Peru using an evolutionary medicine perspective. Our findings suggest Dorsey et al.Page 9 Am J Phys Anthropol .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 01.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript that examining both immune activation and adiposity are important in understanding the effectiveness of iron supplementation programs in dual burden settings.We expected that high immune activation would be associated with a lack of response to iron supplementation.While the presence of cold symptoms was not associated with response to iron supplementation, high CRP at the final interview reduced a child’s odds of responding to iron supplementation.
The different patterns observed between our subjective and objective measures of immune activation may be due to individual variation in reporting child morbidity symptoms or that CRP concentrations can be elevated despite a lack of observable symptoms ( Panter-Brick 2001 ; Rousham et al. 1998 ).These results support previous work exploring child anemia status without iron supplementation that report an association between anemia (with or without iron deficiency) and inflammation ( Hadley and DeCaro 2015 ; Schulze et al.2014 ; Wander et al.2009 ).High WHtR and BMI z-scores, measures of central adiposity and overall weight for height, respectively, were associated with increased odds of responding to treatment in this sample.TSF z-score, a measure of subcutaneous fat, was not associated with response to iron supplementation in preliminary models, suggesting that type (visceral or subcutaneous) and/or distribution of body fat may be important in response to treatment.
Further, we found that both BMI z-score and WHtR may moderate the interaction between CRP and response to iron supplementation though the two adiposity measures were associated with different likelihood of response. These are potentially interesting observations that could be investigated in greater detail in larger follow-up studies.Children with a high BMI z-score (in both high and low CRP groups) and those with intermediate BMI z-score and low CRP all had greater than a 50% probability of responding to iron supplementation.Participants with intermediate BMI z-score and high CRP were the least likely to respond to treatment.While a high probability of responding to treatment was expected from children with low CRP and intermediate BMI z-score when compared to children with high CRP and intermediate BMI z-score, the higher probability of responding to treatment among children with high BMI z-scores with either high or low CRP was not.
This pattern may be due to the protective effects of high energy stores (in the form of body fat) in children. McDade et al.(2008b) report that Tsimane’ children (aged 2-10 years) with lower body fat and elevated CRP experienced smaller gains in height over three months, providing evidence for a trade-off between investment in immune function and growth.Our results suggest that higher levels of adiposity may protect against competing demands for energy stores, such as immune activation.Similarly, in our analysis of BMI z-score as a continuous variable, we observed that while children with low CRP were more likely to respond to treatment than participants with high CRP, lower BMI z-score was associated with decreased probability of responding to treatment and the odds of responding did increase as BMI z-score approached zero in both CRP categories, however, our anaylsis is limited by the low number of individuals with a BMI z-score below zero.
The probability of responding continued to increase steadily for those with low CRP and dramatically for those with high CRP. These findings (Figure 5) are counter to our predictions that the probability of responding to iron supplementation would decrease as BMI z-score increased despite the level of CRP (Figure 2).Our results supplement the ambiguous findings in the literature Dorsey et al.Page 10 Am J Phys Anthropol .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 01.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript on the relationship between anemia status and BMI ( Hutchinson 2016 ; Baumgartner et al.2013 ; Aberli et al.2011; Eftekhari et al.2009 ; Kroker-Lobos et al.2011; Eckhardt et al.2008 ; Zimmermann et al.2008 ; Nead et al.
2004 ) and support findings from a previous study investigating anemia in a presentative sample of children (aged 10-15 years) from a rural Lima community that reports older children and those with high BMI were less likely to present with anemia ( Rodríguez-Zúñiga 2015 ). In Peru, where diet quality is likely to be poor ( Creed-Kanashiro et al.2003 ), the overweight children in this sample may have accrued enough iron or other minerals related to iron absorption (e.g.vitamin A and zinc) to lower their risk of anemia compared to non-overweight participants ( Eckhardt et al.2008 ).
While previous studies exploring the relationship between weight and anemia status used BMI to represent adiposity, we expanded our investigation to include an additional measure of body fat, WHtR, due to the disproportionate increase in waist circumference relative to overall body mass seen in middle-income countries undergoing rapid economic and urbanization transitions similar to the shifts observed in Peru ( Albrecht et al. 2015 ).We found that high WHtR was associated with a greater probability of responding to treatment, but the likelihood of responding to treatment in the WHtR categories differed from the corresponding BMI z-score categories.Children with high WHtR and low CRP had the greatest probability of responding to treatment compared to children with high WHtR and high CRP and children with low WHtR.Participants with low WHtR are the least likely to respond to treatment, despite having high or low CRP.
The variation in patterns observed between the two adiposity measures may be due to differences in what the body fat variables were measuring. In this sample, BMI z-score was associated with TSF z-score, WHtR was not.One way to interpret this pattern is that BMI is a better measure of peripheral body fat while WHtR reflects an accumulation of visceral adipose tissue.Visceral adipose tissue produces a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines that stimulate CRP production, such as IL-6 and TNF- α (Thompson et al.2015 ).Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in children with greater central body fat may explain the lower probability of responding to treatment in children with high WHtR and CRP when compared to children with high BMI z-score and CRP.The cumulative effect of high CRP and other pro-inflammatory cytokines may also explain the variation in probability of responding to treatment between children with high and low CRP among participants with high WHtR.
Having high CRP along with high levels of other pro-inflammatory markers may work together to reduce a child’s probability of responding to treatment due to a stronger innate immune response (resulting in iron sequestration and/or lack of iron absorption), while having low CRP doesn’t create a larger cumulative effect. Research investigating the environmental and behavioral risk factors associated with central obesity and inflammation in Chinese adults report evidence for this potential association.Thompson et al (2015) found that men and women with high WHtR and inflammation were more likely to have infectious disease symptoms than those with high WHtR and no inflammation.More work is needed to understand the range of variation in inflammatory processes associated with central and peripheral adiposity.
It is important to note that the results of our sensitivity analyses with different definitions of response show stronger support for the relationship between final CRP and response Dorsey et al. Page 11 Am J Phys Anthropol .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 01.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript to supplementation.These results provide additional evidence for the allostatic nature of anemia status, and, therefore the importance of considering immune activation and disease ecology when assessing biological nutritional markers.However, our sensitivity models demonstrate weaker support for the relationship between adiposity variables and their interactions with CRP with response.While this suggests that the main findings about body size presented here may not be apparent when these alternative definitions of response are considered.
Our results are limited by several important factors, the sample of anemic children who received iron supplementation is small (n=50). This small sample size resulted in large confidence intervals in logistic regression models and may have limited power to find statistically significant differences between responders and non-responders.Another limitation of our study is the use of a single inflammation measure, CRP.This biomarker increases rapidly during inflammation but also resolves quickly and therefore may not be representative of immune activation throughout the iron supplementation period.To further explore the association between adiposity, immune activation, and response to iron supplementation a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokine biomarkers, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, should be used in future research.We used Hb as our measure of iron deficiency.
While Hb concentration is the most common hematological assessment method used to measure anemia ( Chaparro and Suchdev 2019 ), it lacks specificity for establishing nutritional anemias, such as iron status. Nevertheless, in Peru, recent initiatives by the Ministry of Health use Hb to assess anemia status in national-level programs at health centers and in schools, incorporating methods used by these initiatives allows for comparison between reported prevalence and rates of anemia in this sample.Additionally, measuring Hb is inexpensive and easy to measure with field­ friendly testing.Thus, despite the lack of specificity for establishing nutritional anemias, such as iron status ( Balarajan et al.2011 ), Hb was used as an objective measure of anemia in this study.Furthermore, while some studies suggest that Hb may not be affected by iron supplementation and recommend including more specific measures of iron status (Pasricha et al.2018; Stolzfus et al.
2004), others report increases in Hb but not in markers of iron status (serum ferritin and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin) in participants receiving daily iron supplementation ( Zavaleta et al. 2000 ).Due to the conflicting reports on iron supplementation’s impact on Hb status and the possibility that anemia in this sample may not be due to iron deficiency, future research should explore the effects of iron supplementation on additional biomarkers associated with anemia and iron level, such as ferritin, serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) and/or hepcidin.Despite these limitations, these results further our understanding of the relationship between immune activation and anemia status within a dual burden context.This study demonstrates evolutionary medicine’s potential to provide insight into patterns of disease and highlights the need for further investigation of child inflammatory profiles within a dual burden context.
The human immune system is characterized by substantial developmental plasticity. Longitudinal research on immune function demonstrates nutritional and microbial exposures in early childhood are important determinants of inflammation in adulthood ( McDade 2012 ).The inclusion of central and peripheral adiposity measures in this study expands our knowledge on the influence of visceral adipose tissue on the relationship between immune function and anemia in children.Further research on the variation of inflammatory processes Dorsey et al.Page 12 Am J Phys Anthropol .Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 01.Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript associated with visceral adiposity in childhood is needed to investigate pathways to health and disease later in life.This research has important public health implications.
While the probability of anemia and overweight co-occurring may be low, both of these conditions are caused by malnutrition and have links to chronic disease and negative developmental effects ( Stoltzfus et al. 2004 ; Popkin et al.2006 ).The high prevalence of anemia and the rising rates of overweight and obesity in Peru warrant prevention and education efforts as well as further investigation into the dual burden of disease.CONCLUSION We found that high immune activation is associated with a lack of response to iron supplementation after one month of treatment and that body fat potentially moderates the association between immune function and response to treatment.Different adiposity measures provide variation in the probability of anemic children responding to iron supplementation treatment.Children with low CRP and high WHtR are the most likely to respond to treatment when compared to participants with low WHtR and high WHtR with low CRP.
In contrast, children with high BMI z-score (with both high and low CRP) as well as intermediate BMI z-score and CRP had greater odds of responding to treatment than children with intermediate BMI z-score and high CRP. While we expected a reduced probability of response to iron supplementation associated with high immune activation compared to low immune activation in children with low and high body fat, this pattern did not remain with BMI z-scores greater than zero.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank the study participants and their parents, Gisella Barbagelatta (field coordinator), and the rest of the health center staff.This research received support from the National Science Foundation (BCS-1731120), Fulbright Program, Frank Porter Graham Institute, Sigma Xi, American Philosophical Society, University of North Carolina, International Chapter of P.E.O.
