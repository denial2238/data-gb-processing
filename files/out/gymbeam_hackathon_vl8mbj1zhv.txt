Methods: A total of 39 study patients were enrolled.At baseline, bleeding on probing (BoP; primary outcome), gingival index (GI), plaque control record (PCR), recession (REC) and probing pocket depth (PPD) for the calculation of the periodontal inﬂamed surface area (PISA) were documented.
After subsequent professional mechanical plaque removal (PMPR), participants were randomly provided with a supply of sachets containing either a speciﬁc collagen peptide preparation (test group; n= 20) or a placebo (placebo group; n= 19) to be consumed dissolved in liquid once daily until reevaluation at day 90.Results: PMPR supplemented with the consumption of the speciﬁc collagen peptides resulted in a signiﬁcantly lower mean percentage of persisting BoP-positive sites than PMPR plus placebo (test: 10.4% baseline vs. 3.0% reevaluation; placebo: 14.2% baseline vs.9.4% reevaluation; effect size: 0.86).Mean PISA and GI values were also reduced compared to baseline, with a signiﬁcant difference in favor of the test group (PISA test: 170.6 mm2baseline vs.53.7 mm2reevaluation; PISA placebo: 229.4 mm2baseline vs.184.3 mm2reevaluation; GI test: 0.5 baseline vs.0.1 reevaluation; GI placebo: 0.4 baseline vs.0.3 reevaluation).
PCR was also signiﬁcantly decreased in both experimental groups at revaluation, but the difference between the groups did not reach the level of signiﬁcance. Conclusions: The supplementary intake of speciﬁc collagen peptides may further enhance the anti-inﬂammatory effect of PMPR in periodontal recall patients.Keywords: collagen; peptide fragment; bleeding on probing; gingival; food supplement; periodontitis; gingivitis 1.Introduction Professional mechanical plaque control complemented by efﬁcacious oral hygiene is the established standard of supportive periodontal aftercare (SPC) [ 1].Its validity has been veriﬁed by numerous studies [ 2–6].Nevertheless, even in the majority of successfully treated cases, a small but clinically relevant amount of periodontal inﬂammation persists, reﬂected by the number of periodontal pockets with remaining bleeding on probing (BoP), which is associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence or progression [ 7–10].
As the occurrence of disease-promoting bacterial dysbiosis is strongly promoted by an increased inﬂammatory status of the host, the use of adjuvant therapeutics that modulate inﬂammation at the local and/or systemic level is advocated to further improve the outcome of mechanical plaque control [ 11,12]. This may involve the systemic or local administration of drugs that either inhibit the inﬂammatory response or actively promote its resolution [ 13], as well as targeted changes in the daily diet of patients [ 14–18] or the consumption of food supplements such as probiotics or omega-3 fatty acids [19–22]).The list of known anti-inﬂammatory food supplements also includes certain collagen peptides that have been successfully evaluated as therapeutic adjuncts in the control Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4473.

In animal and human interventional trials, the consumption of collagen peptides high in hydroxyproline, glycine and proline resulted in improved wound healing and the remediation of impaired immune system function [ 26,27].The preventive addition of glycine to the culture media of isolated intestinal epithelial cells mitigated the negative impact of inﬂicted oxidative stress at the cellular level [ 28].In addition, high glycine concentrations in the cell culture media of porcine intestinal epithelial cells improved the barrier function of tight junctions [29].
Furthermore, the addition of speciﬁc collagen hydrolysates to the culture media of bacteria derived from the oral or intestinal microbiota had a signiﬁcant impact on the selective microbial utilization of amino acids [ 30,31]. It also favoured the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids, which, among other beneﬁts, are known to enhance the maturation of regulatory T-cells and the sealing of epithelial barriers [32].Based on these in vitro observations, the oral administration of speciﬁc collagen pep- tides in patients suffering from chronic osteoarthritis has already entered clinical practice and resulted in a relevant reduction in pain and functional impairments [33–35].It was the aim of this study to assess the impact of the adjuvant consumption of a speciﬁc, commercially available collagen peptide food supplement on parameters of periodontal inﬂammation in a cohort of aftercare patients.2.Material and Methods 2.1.
Study Design This investigation was designed as a two-arm, double blind, parallel group, ran- domised placebo-controlled trial with a 3-month observation period. The study protocol was established in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013, and the criteria of good clinical practice.It was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Wuerzburg (ﬁle # 37/18-me) and registered with clinicaltrials.gov (identiﬁer # NCT03765125).All participants were informed about the objectives and risks in personal interviews and were included in the study after having given written informed consent.2.2.Study Population Study patients were recruited from treated chronic periodontitis patients who were in regular supportive aftercare at the Department of Periodontology of the University Hospital of Wuerzburg.The study was conducted between 21 September 2018 (ﬁrst patient in) and 26 August 2019 (last patient out).2.3.
Eligibility Criteria Eligibility criteria for study participation were a minimum of 10 natural teeth, a history of treated chronic periodontitis followed by regular supportive periodontal aftercare and the presence of mild-to-moderate chronic gingivitis equal to a gingival index (GI) score of 1 or 2 at a minimum of three teeth. 2.4.Exclusion Criteria Exclusion criteria were the manifestation of inflammatory oral mucosal diseases other than periodontitis, the presence of xerostomia, pregnancy , acute infections, smoking > 10 cigarettes per day , the intake of antibiotics and/or anti-inflammatory drugs < 4 weeks prior to screening and the presence of chronic systemic diseases (e.g., diabetes).2.5.Experimental Preparations Both experimental preparations to be consumed by the study patients were manufac- tured and supplied by GELITA AG (Eberbach, Germany).
Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4473 3 of 11 The test preparation (Verisol®B, GELITA AG, Eberbach, Germany) consisted of a mixture of speciﬁc, bioactive collagen peptides with an average molecular weight of approximately 2 kDa and an average particle size of about 150 µm. The placebo preparation consisted of silica (Evonik, Germany) being identical regarding taste, smell and color, as well as particle size and consistence to the test preparation.Both experimental preparations were manufactured in compliance with the European Community (EC) regulation 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs and packaged in individual code-labelled sachets containing the daily dosage of 5 g.According to the manufacturer’s information, the daily dose of the collagen hydrolysate administered for improving skin conditions is usually 2.5 g [ 36,37].
Evidence from other medical ﬁelds concerning the therapy of knee joint pain [ 38] or osteoporosis [ 39] as well as unpublished pretrial data on the impact of collagen peptides on gingivitis suggested that doubling the dosage to 5 g daily may be advisable. 2.6.Sequence of Study Intervention The sequence of the study intervention is schematically depicted in Figure 1.Nutrients 2022 , 14, 4473 3 of 12 Both experimental preparations to be co nsumed by the study patients were manu- factured and supplied by GELITA AG (Eberbach, Germany).The test preparation (Verisol®B, GELITA AG, Eberbach, Germany) consisted of a mixture of specific, bioactive collagen peptid es with an average molecular weight of ap- proximately 2 kDa and an average particle size of about 150 μm.The placebo preparation consisted of silica (Evonik, Germany) being identical regarding taste, smell and color, as well as particle size and consistence to the test preparation.
Both experimental prepara- tions were manufactured in compliance with the European Community (EC) regulation 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs and pa ckaged in individual code-labelled sachets containing the daily dosage of 5 g. According to the manufacturer’s information, the daily dose of the collagen hydrolysate administered for improving skin conditions is usually 2.5 g [36,37] .Evidence from other medical fields conc erning the therapy of knee joint pain [38] or osteoporosis [39] as well as unpublished pretrial data on the impact of collagen peptides on gingivitis suggested that doubling the dosage to 5 g daily may be advisable.2.6.Sequence of Study Intervention The sequence of the study intervention is schematically depicted in Figure 1 .Figure 1.Recruitment, drop-outs and protocol violat ions during the stud y observation period.2.6.1.Visit 1 Baseline (Day 0) Figure 1.Recruitment, drop-outs and protocol violations during the study observation period.
Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4473 4 of 11 2.6.1. Visit 1 Baseline (Day 0) At baseline, the parameters bleeding on probing (BoP; primary outcome), probing pocket depth (PPD), gingival recession (REC), gingival index (GI) and plaque control record (PCR) were assessed on all teeth.A general health proﬁle of the participants, including current intake of medications and frequency of smoking, was documented using a questionnaire.Assessment of BoP and calculation of the Periodontal Inﬂamed Surface Area (PISA)-Index, REC, PPD and BoP were recorded at six sites per tooth (mesio- buccal, buccal, disto-buccal, disto-oral, oral, mesio-oral) using a manual periodontal probe (UNC-15 ) (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA), measured to the nearest millimeter.Any bleeding spot appearing within 30 s after probing was recorded as a BoP-positive site.
Subsequently, all teeth were cleaned supra- and subgingivally by standard PMPR using hand instruments and ultrasonic scalers followed by air polishing with a low-abrasive erythritol cleaning powder. Finally, all participants randomly received a supply of code-labelled sachets containing either the experimental collagen peptide preparation (test group; n= 20) or the placebo preparation (control group; n= 19).The preparations had to be consumed once daily suspended in cold or warm beverages or other aqueous foods.Consumption time could be chosen freely at one’s own discretion, regardless of the timing of oral hygiene or meals.Unused sachets should be returned at the follow-up appointment.2.6.2.Visit 2 Reevaluation (Day 90) At the follow-up appointment on day 90, BoP , PPD, REC, GI and PCR were recorded again as described before, and unused sachets returned by the participants were collected.
The total amount of periodontal inﬂammation present in each patient was calculated from the recorded BoP , REC and PPD scores using the PISA-Index [40]. 2.6.3.Assessment of Gingival Index (GI) The GI is used to assess the degree of inﬂammation of the gingiva.In the variation of the GI according to Lobene [ 41] applied here, the degree of inﬂammation was assessed visually on the basis of colour and surface changes as well as swelling.The GI was recorded on the buccal aspect of all teeth.2.6.4.Assessment of PCR The extent of plaque coverage of the teeth was quantiﬁed using the Plaque Control Record (PCR) [ 42].Brieﬂy, the crown of a tooth is divided into four quadrants, and the presence/absence of bacterial plaque on each quadrant is assessed.The percentage of tooth quadrants covered by bacterial plaque is then calculated.Before recording the PCR all tooth surfaces were dried by an air-syringe to make adhering bacterial plaque visible.2.6.5.
Assessment of Consumption Compliance Consumption compliance was calculated by subtracting the number of unused, re- turned sachets from the total number of sachets provided at baseline. Consumption of the study preparation was considered to be per protocol when ≤10% of the supplied sachets were returned unused.2.6.6.Adverse Events The study participants were instructed to report any adverse events immediately, whether related or unrelated to the consumption of the experimental preparations, and were speciﬁcally asked at the end of the study about the occurrence of adverse events during the trial.Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4473 5 of 11 2.6.7.Blinding, Randomisation and Examiner Calibration All clinical examinations were conducted by one experienced clinician who was blinded to the group assignment of the study patients.To minimize intra-examiner variability of periodontal measurements, examiner cali- bration was performed according to Hefti et al.and Grossi et al.[ 43,44].
Random allocation of the experimental preparation was ensured using a computer-generated randomisation list with a block size of four. 2.7.Statistical Analysis 2.7.1.Primary Study Outcome and Null Hypothesis The primary outcome of this trial was deﬁned as the change in the percentage of BoP- positive probing sites between baseline and the end of the study with the null hypothesis of no signiﬁcant differences between both experimental groups.2.7.2.Secondary Study Outcomes Secondary study outcomes were differences in the recorded mean scores of GI, PCR and PISA (calculated from PPD and REC) at baseline and day 90.2.7.3.
Sample Size Calculation In order to be able to verify a difference of 20% in the reduction of BoP-positive sites between the test and control group at day 90 with a power of 90%, signiﬁcance level α= 0.05 and an estimated standard deviation of ±20%, sample size calculation resulted in a group size of 2 ×19 study patients when using the Mann–Whitney Utest (G-Power, Version 3.1.9.4). 2.7.4.Statistical Data Analysis Data distribution was examined using probit diagrams with Lillefors limits.As most of the data deviated from a normal distribution, rank tests were used throughout.The difference between study groups was analysed with the Mann–Whitney Utest.The change from baseline to post-intervention within groups was analysed with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.Dichotomous values were tested with Fisher’s exact test.All data are presented as mean ±SD or median with (25% tail, 75% tail); WinMEDAS statistical software package was used for all statistical analyses.
All the tests in the descrip- tive analysis were conducted as two-sided tests. The signiﬁcance level was set to p≤0.05.Assessment of the study data was performed as an intention-to-treat analysis.3.Results 3.1.Recruitment, Drop-Outs, Protocol Violations From a total of 83 screened patients, 49 were recruited for study participation.Six of them withdrew their consent prior to baseline examination.Finally, 43 patients were randomly assigned to the test ( n= 23) or the control group ( n= 20).After the baseline visit, three study patients (two test /one control) left the study due to time conﬂicts, and one study participant (test group) left due to developing serious illness unrelated to the consumed study preparation.The remaining 39 patients (test n= 20 and control n= 19) completed the study per protocol and were included in the data analysis.Recruitment and drop-outs are depicted as a CONSORT [45] ﬂow diagram in Figure 1.3.2.
Reporting of Adverse Events During the course of the trial, no adverse events were reported by the study patients. 3.3.Periodontal and General Health Proﬁle Periodontal and general health-related parameters are shown in Table 1.In the placebo group, the percentage of male study patients was signiﬁcantly higher than in the test group Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4473 6 of 11 (67% vs.33%).All other recorded individual differences were small and statistically not signiﬁcant.Table 1.Demographics and general health proﬁle.Variable Test Group Control Group p-Value n= 20 n= 19 Age (yrs) median (CI)59.6 (56.6–62.6) (55.2–63.1) p U= 0.94 Male gender no.(%) 6 (33%) 12 (67%) P c= 0.036 No.

The difference between the groups at reevaluation (test: 53.7 mm2, control: 184.3 mm2) was signiﬁcant ( p≤0.011).

The mean GI score at day 90 was signiﬁcantly reduced compared to baseline in both experimental groups (test: GI 0.1 ( p≤0.00011)); control: GI 0.3 ( p≤0.022)). The difference between the groups proved to be signiﬁcant ( p≤0.029).3.8.Plaque Control Record (PCR) Baseline mean PCR scores did not differ signiﬁcantly between the groups (test: 25.6%; control: 25.4%).At day 90, the mean PCR score was signiﬁcantly reduced compared to the baseline (test: 9.6% ( p< 0.00025); control:18.1% ( p< 0.012)).The difference between the groups did not reach the level of signiﬁcance ( p≤0.58).4.Discussion The results of this controlled clinical trial suggest that the addition of a speciﬁc collagen peptide-containing food supplement to the daily diet of periodontal aftercare patients may further improve the anti-inﬂammatory efﬁcacy of PMPR, as shown by a signiﬁcantly lower percentage of BoP-positive sites in the test group at reevaluation.
The difference in the primary outcome was also associated with signiﬁcantly more pronounced improvements in the secondary outcomes of PISA and GI, corresponding to a signiﬁcantly greater decrease in overall periodontal inﬂammatory burden. The reduction in periodontal inﬂammation observed in the control group after PMPR was well within the range reported in systematic reviews of the efﬁcacy of PMPR in periodontal aftercare [ 2,5].Nevertheless, an observed mean percentage of BoP-positive sites of 9.4% at reevaluation is still close to the deﬁnition of gingival inﬂammation according to the current classiﬁcation [7].By contrast, the addition of speciﬁc collagen peptide consumption to PMPR led to a mean BoP score of only 3.0% at reevaluation.The observed improvement of mean PISA and GI scores in the test group correspond to this situation, with a persisting mean PISA score of only 53.7 mm2compared to 184.3 mm2in the controls.
This demonstrates that the anti-inﬂammatory efﬁcacy of adjuvant collagen peptide consumption in the control of Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4473 8 of 11 periodontal inﬂammation is comparable to the beneﬁts of the adjuvant use of antimicrobial agents reported by a recent meta-analysis [46]. Mean PCR also decreased signiﬁcantly between baseline and reevaluation, without signiﬁcant differences between the groups.This indicates that the observed beneﬁcial impact of collagen peptide consumption on periodontal inﬂammation is not primarily due to improved plaque control.It rather appears to be based on a systemic immune modulation and/or the resolution of disease-promoting bacterial dysbiosis.This is in line with the ﬁndings of other clinical trials evaluating the impact of dietary changes on gingival inﬂammation [14,15,17,18] and the dysbiosis model of periodontitis development [47].
The proposed modulation of the immune system as well as the presumed resolution of bacterial dysbiosis may be due to the high L-arginine content of the speciﬁc collagen peptides used in this study (7.8 g/100 g). The oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline by the activity of a nitric oxide synthases (NOS) is a well-known pathway for the formation of nitric oxide (NO), an essential signalling molecule involved in a multitude of physiological processes in the human body.NO formation plays a major role in the development of inﬂammatory conditions as well as in their resolution and prevention [ 48].It reduces, for example, the synthesis of the chemo-attractive protein MCP-1 [ 49] and inhibits leucocyte adherence to vascular walls as well as platelet aggregation and activation [ 50].As far as we know, there have been no previous clinical trials assessing the impact of dietary collagen peptides on periodontal inﬂammation.
However, the results of our study conﬁrm the positive ﬁndings of investigations that assessed the anti-inﬂammatory effect of collagen peptide consumption in patients suffering from chronic osteoarthritis [ 33–35] as well as endothelial dysfunction [51]. In addition to directly modulating the immune response of the host, the presence and formation of NO also has a profound impact on the composition and metabolism of the orodigestive microbiota [ 18,51–55].NO is found in signiﬁcant quantities in dental plaque [ 56] and has a pronounced inhibitory effect against periodontal pathogens [ 52,53,57].An increase in salivary nitrite as an alternative source of physiological NO-formation [ 58] was accompanied by a resolution of disease-promoting dysbiosis in gingivitis-associated bacterial biofilms [ 18,59].In addition, the ingested collagen peptides may also act as a prebiotic.
Their microbial fermentation in the colon increases the concentration of tissue- protective antioxidants as well as the concentration of short-chain fatty acids, which are important mediators of lymphocyte maturation [32,60,61]. Relevant limitations of this study are the comparatively short observation period of 3 months without long-term follow-up, the small number of participants and the lack of documentation of dietary behaviour or adherence to a standardised diet.These are in line with the reported restrictions of other clinical trials evaluating the impact of speciﬁc dietary intervention [ 15,21].They also reﬂect the fact that it is very difﬁcult to successfully conduct studies involving food restrictions in human volunteers or patients over a long period of time due to a steadily decreasing level of compliance [62].As mean PCR and GI scores also improved signiﬁcantly in the placebo group, the impact of a positive Hawthorne effect may not be ruled out.
Nevertheless, the signiﬁcant difference between both experimental groups regarding mean GI scores at day 90 in favor of the test group suggests a signiﬁcantly more pronounced reduction in inﬂammation not attributable to improved oral hygiene alone. Therefore, future studies should aim to recruit larger cohorts of periodontitis pa- tients with a higher inﬂammatory burden and provide an observation period of at least 6–12 months to test the clinical relevance of the ﬁndings obtained in this pilot study.Ad- ditionally, the optimal dosage of administration needs to be established.As the effect of a collagen peptide preparation on the microbiota and the host response is decisively inﬂuenced by its speciﬁc composition [ 32], the results observed with the consumption of this study preparation may not be transferred to similar preparations with a different composition without further clinical evaluation.Nutrients 2022 ,14, 4473 9 of 11 5.
Conclusions Supplementing professional plaque control with the daily consumption of speciﬁc collagen peptides may have the potential to further improve the outcome of established periodontal aftercare therapy. Due to the limits of the present investigation, however, further research is needed before a general recommendation for daily practice can be given.Author Contributions: All authors contributed signiﬁcantly to the manuscript by writing the draft, evaluating the data and critically revising the manuscript.Y.J.-S.and U.S.jointly conceived the design of the study, contributed to the interpretation of the data and wrote the manuscript.P .S.recruited all study patients.Y.J.-S.recorded the study parameters.Professional mechanical plaque removal (PMPR) was performed by J.H.S.F.contributed to data analysis and the acquisition of external funding to ﬁnance the study.I.H.performed the bioinformatics/statistical analysis.
