Outbreaks from 1998 –2015 with a single confirmed implicated food source in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System were ana-lysed using logistic regression to assess associations between a food category, sex and age.Males were more likely to be involved in outbreaks attributed to beef, pork, game, dairyand shellfish; females were more likely to be involved in grains-beans, nuts-seeds, fruits,sprouts and vegetable row crops outbreaks. Children <5-years-old were more likely thanother age groups to be involved in dairy outbreaks, children 5 –19-years-old were most likely to be involved in beef and game outbreaks, adults 20 –49-years-old were most likely to be involved in fish, shellfish and sprout outbreaks and adults ⩾50-years-old were most likely to be involved in turkey outbreaks.Age and sex are associated with specific food categoriesin outbreaks.
This information may be useful in helping to identify sources of foodborne dis-ease outbreaks. Introduction There are an estimated 9.4 million foodborne illnesses caused by known pathogens in the USA every year [ 1].Although most are sporadic, outbreak-associated illnesses are an important source of information about the foods and pathogens causing illness [ 2,3].Identifying the source of an outbreak is a critical part of containment and removal of the contaminated sourcefrom the food supply.Several factors can affect the quantity and variety of food an individual or family consumes, including income, sex, age, race and ethnicity and health status [ 4–12].For example, men are more likely to consume ‘high risk ’foods, including unpasteurised milk, raw shellfish, runny eggs and pink hamburgers than women [ 4–6].This difference was also observed for school- aged boys and girls [ 6–8].
Women are more likely to consume fruits and vegetables, including alfalfa sprouts, a high-risk food [ 6]. Differences in consumption patterns between school-aged children and adults have also been shown in national surveys; children are more likely to con-sume raw fruits and tomatoes, and adults more likely to eat dark green vegetables, cantaloupe and strawberries [ 10].Given the sex and age differences in food preferences, it remains unknown whether these differences are reflected in the demographics of outbreak-associated foodborne illness.Usingdata from foodborne disease outbreaks in the USA, we analysed the associations among con-taminated food sources and demographics (age and sex) of outbreak-associated illnesses.
Methods Since 1973, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has collected data on food- borne disease outbreaks (defined as two or more persons with a similar illness and exposure toa common food) through the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS).FDOSS is a passive national surveillance system with state, local, territorial and federal publichealth agencies reporting outbreaks caused by bacterial, viral, parasitic and chemical agents[2]. Data collected for each outbreak include the implicated food, number of illnesses, re- porting state, location of food preparation (e.g.restaurant), etiologic agent, the number and/or proportion of men and women, number and/or proportion of cases aged <5-years-old,5–19-years-old, 20 –49-years-old and ⩾50-years-old.Only confirmed aetiologic agents were included in analyses.Data are reported in aggregate for each outbreak and information onindividual cases are not captured in the FDOSS system.
Outbreaks with first illness onset from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2015, were reported to FDOSS by 20 December 2016, occurred outside of a correctional institute and had a single confirmed implicated food source category (as defined by the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration) were eligiblefor inclusion [ 13]. The 19 categories included beef, pork, chicken, turkey, game, dairy, eggs, fish, shellfish, oils-sugars, grains-beans,nuts-seeds, fruits, fungi, herbs, root-underground vegetables (e.g.carrots, potatoes), seeded vegetables (e.g.legumes, tomatoes),sprouts and vegetable row crops (e.g.asparagus, lettuce) [ 13].Outbreaks with ‘other ’(e.g.other poultry) and nonspecific (e.g.land animals) implicated food sources were excluded.Duringthose years, there were 18 938 outbreaks, which caused 355 239illnesses (median 8, range 2 –1939) and of those, 4008 outbreaks causing 75 845 illnesses met the inclusion criteria and wereincluded in the analysis.
The majority of excluded outbreaks(n= 10 345, 72%) were excluded due to not having a confirmed implicated food source. Counts of males, females and personsin each age category were calculated using reported proportionswhen counts were not directly reported by the health department.Overall, outbreak records were missing data on sex for 17 357(23%) persons and were missing data on age for 29 985 (40%)persons.This missing data were assumed to be missing com-pletely at random, and thus assumed not to bias the estimationof the relationship of sex and age on food category [ 14].We calculated odds ratios using logistic regression on sex and age group (categorised as <5, 5 –19, 20 –49 (reference) and ⩾50-years-old) for each food category.
We used contrast statements to compare individual categories of age to all other ages combined.For multiple comparison testing, we adopted a Bonferroni correction and a P-value < 0.003 was considered statistically significant (at the nominal significance of 0.05). All analyses were performed usingSAS 9.4 (SAS Institute., Cary, NC, USA).Institutional ReviewBoard (IRB) exemption was received from Emory University.Results Among the 4008 included outbreaks, fish (21%), beef (16%), chicken (11%), shellfish (9%) and pork (7%) were the five most common implicated food categories ( Table 1 ).Outbreak- associated illnesses were slightly more likely to be in females (54%)than males (46%).By age group, 6% of all cases were <5-years-old,19% were between 5 and 19-years-old, 47% were between 20and 49-years-old and 28% were ⩾50-years-old.Outbreak aetiology was identified in 59% ( n= 2345) of out- breaks, which accounted for 76% of cases ( n= 57 992).
The most common outbreak categories with viral aetiologies (219 outbreaks)were row crops (25%), shellfish (21%) and beef (12%). Among bac-terial outbreaks (1473 outbreaks), over half of all outbreaks werecaused by beef (18%), chicken (13%), dairy (14%) and pork(10%) and over half of parasitic outbreaks ( n=4 3 ) w e r e c a u s e d by game ( n= 15, 35%) and fruit ( n= 10, 23%).Almost all outbreaks caused by fish toxins (537 outbreaks) were in fish (97%), comparedwith shellfish (3%).Fish also made up over half ( n= 42, 58%) of all outbreaks caused by ‘other ’aetiologies (73 outbreaks).Males were more likely to be involved in outbreaks attributed to beef (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.12 –1.23), shellfish (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.50 –1.75), pork (1.32, 95% CI 1.25 –1.39), dairy (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.16 –1.32) and game (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.86 –3.50), ( Table 2 ).
On the other hand, females were more likely to be involved in out-breaks attributed to vegetable row crops (OR 1.41, 95% CI1.32 –1.50), grains-beans (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12 –1.44), fruits (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.36 –1.54), seeded vegetables (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.04 –1.16), sprouts (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10 –1.40) and nuts- seeds (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.14 –1.38).As age increased, the odds of being involved in a dairy out- break significantly decreased, with children <5-years-old about3 times as likely (OR 3.18, 95% CI 2.85 –3.54), 5 –19-yearsold about twice as likely (OR 2.25, 95% CI 2.07 –2.45) and adults ⩾50-years-old significantly less likely to be involved (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64 –0.79) compared with 20 –49-years-old ( Table 3 ). To determine whether certain age categories were at the highestor lowest risk compared with those of other ages, we also testedcontrasts comparing each age group to all other age groups com-bined.
In these analyses, children <5-years-old were most likely tobe involved in dairy (OR 3.18, 95% CI 2.85 –3.54), fruit (OR 2.55, 95% CI 2.25 –2.89) and seeded vegetable (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.89 – 2.40) outbreaks and least likely to be involved in pork (OR 0.65,95% CI 0.56 –0.76), vegetable row crop (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.45 – 0.66), or grain-bean (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 –0.81) outbreaks. Children 5 –19-years-old were most likely to be involved in beef (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.67 –1.92) and game (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.97 – 4.78) outbreaks.Adults 20 –49-years-old were most likely to be involved in fish (OR 2.72, 95% CI 2.45 –3.03), shellfish (OR 4.00, 95% CI 3.29 –4.86), root-underground (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.52 –2.34) and sprout (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.79 –2.51) outbreaks and least likely to be involved in nut-seed (OR 0.42, 95% CI0.41 –0.49) outbreaks.
Finally, adults ⩾50-years-old were most likely to be involved in turkey (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.76 –2.14) and herb (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.26 –1.82) outbreaks and least likely to be involved in chicken (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.59 –0.69) outbreaks. Egg, fungi and oil-sugar outbreaks had no single age group thatwas significantly at higher or lower odds than all other age groupscombined.Table 1.

D.Strassle et al.Discussion Based on an analysis of 18 years of FDOSS data, our results sug- gest that specific sex and age groups are associated with a higherodds of being in outbreaks from certain foods.
These associationsmight assist in the investigation of the cause of foodborne diseaseoutbreaks. Outbreaks associated with red meats, dairy and shell-fish had more males and outbreaks associated with vegetablerow crops, grains-beans, fruits, seeded vegetables, sprouts andnuts-seeds were more likely to involve females.Age distributionsin outbreaks also varied by food category.Young children(<5-years-old) were most likely to be involved in outbreaksattributed to dairy, fruits and seeded vegetables and children5–19-years-old were most likely to be involved in outbreaks attrib- uted to beef and game.Additionally, adults 20 –49 were most likely to be associated with outbreaks involving fish, shellfish and sprouts and older adults ( ⩾50-years-old) were most likely to be involved in outbreaks attributed to turkey.This studydemonstrates that the demographic distribution of outbreak ill-nesses might result from the demographically related food prefer-ences.
These results are consistent with previous studies of foodconsumption patterns across age and sex in the USA [ 4–12]. It is also possible that these results reflect pathogen patterns, asfoods can be associated with specific pathogens and age hasbeen shown to be a risk factor for certain types of infections[15–17].While this study focused on aggregated outbreak data, age and sex differences in individual outbreaks can be quite striking, mak-ing these associations potentially even more useful.For example,in a 2009 multistate outbreak (228 cases, 13 states) involving alfalfa sprouts, 69% of patients were female and the median agewas 29 [ 18].And in a 2014 outbreak involving raw milk in Utah (99 cases), 44% of cases were in children <18 years of age,despite this age group only making up roughly 1/4 of all outbreakcases [ 19].
Moreover, information on food consumption patterns has already been used to further confirm the identification of contamination sources in foodborne disease outbreaks. In a 2004 outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis infections in Oregon, hypothesis-generating interview results were compared with thefood consumption patterns of Oregon residents and helped iden-tify raw almonds as the source of the outbreak [ 20].In 2008, the source of an outbreak of Salmonella Agona infections was further confirmed by comparing the percentage of cases reported eatingpuffed rice cereal with the total ready-to-eat cereal market sharein the USA [ 21].Recently, a similar prediction tool by White et al.was created to assist in food category identification, specif- ically for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli outbreaks [ 22].
They found that sex distributions predicted the implicated food-with women being more likely to be involved in vegetableoutbreaks-, although their analyses were limited to outbreakscaused by beef, vegetables and dairy products. Our analyses alsosuggest that sex, as well as age, may help in the identification ofimplicated foods during outbreak investigations.A limitation of this study is that sex and age are reported in aggregate and therefore interactions between the two variablescould not be meaningfully assessed.Future studies could refinethese estimates by using datasets where both the age and sex ofeach case is known.Additional research into more specific foodTable 2.

Bold indicates the significance of P< 0.003 (Bonferroni corrected).4 P. D.Strassle et al.groups may also be required.For example, while young children were most likely to be involved with a nut-seed outbreak, this cat-egory included outbreaks caused by whole nuts, nut butter(including peanut butter), crushed/ground seeds (e.g.chia seedpowder) and seed paste (e.g.tahini).In this analysis, almost80% of nut-seed outbreak cases were involved in a peanut butteroutbreak and it is very possible that young children may not bemore likely to be in outbreaks caused by all of these different nut-seed foods.
There was also a high proportion of missing datawhich we assumed to be missing completely at random and notto be a source of bias in our results, which may not be true.Additionally, FDOSS is a dynamic surveillance system and theresults of this study may differ from prior or future reports.Finally, only a small proportion of foodborne illnesses are identi-fied as being associated with outbreaks and many outbreaks neverhave a food source identified and/or have unknown etiologies. InFDOSS, roughly half of all foodborne outbreaks have no impli-cated food source and were excluded from this analysis.Knowledge about associations among outbreak demographic characteristics and contaminated food sources is still limited.Asnovel contamination routes and outbreak sources continue to becomemore prevalent, new methods for outbreak source identificationwill need to be developed.
This study suggests that outbreakdemographic information may be useful to assist investigatorsin narrowing down potential contaminated food sources in out-breaks. Additional research is needed to improve food profilingin outbreak investigations.Author ORCIDs.P.D.Strassle 0000-0002-1072-1560 .Acknowledgements.We thank Daniel Dewey-Mattia and the entire National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) Team of the Enteric Diseases Epidemiology Branch, Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for their help with this study.The authorswould also like to acknowledge state and local health departments for collecting and reporting outbreak data.This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.Conflict of interest.The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
