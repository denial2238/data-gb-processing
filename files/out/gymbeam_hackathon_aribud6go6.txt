Metabolic alterations as hyperglycemia and in ﬂammation induce myocardial molecular events enhancing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Those alterations are responsible for a progressive loss of cardiomyocytes, cardiac stem cells, and consequent cardiovascular complications.Currently, there are no eﬀ ective pharmacological measures to protect the heart from these metabolic modiﬁ cations, and the development of new therapeutic approaches, focused on improvement of the oxidative stress condition, is pivotal.The protective e ﬀects of levocarnitine (LC) in patients with ischemic heart disease are related to the attenuation of oxidative stress, but LC mechanisms have yet to be fully understood.Objective .The aim of this work was to investigate LC ’s role in oxidative stress condition, on ROS production and mitochondrial detoxifying function in H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes during hyperglycemia.Methods.
H9c2 cells in the hyperglycemic state (25 mmol/L glucose) were exposed to 0.5 or 5 mM LC for 48 and 72 h: LC eﬀ ects on signaling pathways involved in oxidative stress condition were studied by Western blot and immuno ﬂuorescence analysis. To evaluate ROS production, H9c2 cells were exposed to H2O2after LC pretreatment.Results .Our in vitro study indicates how LC supplementation might protect cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress- related damage, preventing ROS formation and activating antioxidant signaling pathways in hyperglycemic conditions.Inparticular, LC promotes STAT3 activation and signi ﬁcantly increases the expression of antioxidant protein SOD2.Hyperglycemic cardiac cells are characterized by impairment in mitochondrial dysfunction and the CaMKII signal: LC promotes CaMKII expression and activation and enhancement of AMPK protein synthesis.Our results suggest that LC might ameliorate metabolic aspects of hyperglycemic cardiac cells.
Finally, LC doses herein used did not modify H9c2 growth rate andviability. Conclusions .Our novel study demonstrates that LC improves the microenvironment damaged by oxidative stress (induced by hyperglycemia), thus proposing this nutraceutical compound as an adjuvant in diabetic cardiac regenerative medicine.1.Introduction Cardiovascular complications are recognized as the primary cause of mortality in subjects with diabetes mellitus (DM)[1, 2], characterized by hyperglycemia which is determinedby a defect of insulin secretion, insulin action, or both [3].Moreover, DM is associated with in ﬂammation condition.Chronic hyperglycemia, characterizing overt diabetes, or ﬂuctuant hyperglycemia, present in the prediabetic condi- tion, are responsible for the activation of numerous signalingpathways that exacerbate the systemic in ﬂammation and lead to the development of diabetic complications [4, 5].
Recent evidence establishes how hyperglycemia is involved in theregulation of sirtuin (SIRT) transcription factors. The dereg-ulation of SIRT expression is strictly correlated with the pro-gression of in ﬂammation and atherosclerotic disease.In particular, Balestrieri et al.demonstrated that SIRT6 proteinexpression is downregulated in atherosclerotic plaques ofdiabetics, and this defect is linked to the chronic oxidativestress condition [6].Those evidences indicate that chronicHindawi Journal of Diabetes Research Volume 2018, Article ID 4028297, 12 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/4028297 inﬂammation, oxidative stress condition and predisposition to ischemic heart disease are higher in patients with DM than in nondiabetics [7, 8].Traditional therapeutic approaches as well as innovative promising strategies [7] (i.e., stem/progenitor cell therapy,existing cardiomyocyte proliferation, and reprogrammingnoncardiac cells) are limited in patients with DM [8 –11].
Peri- procedural intensive glycemic control, during earlypercutane-ous coronary intervention in diabetic patients, was shown to improve myocardial protection by increasing SIRT1 expres- sion, endothelial progenitor cell number, and their capabilityto diﬀerentiate in mature cardiomyocytes [12]. Hyperglyce- mia in diabetic subjects is the major factor responsible for thefailure of regenerative myocardial therapeutic strategies.Recent data indicate that the overproduction of reactive oxy-gen species (ROS) and the oxidative stress condition are themain causes involved in diabetic cardiac injury and in the lackof success in cardiac regenerative therapies [13 –17].Hypergly- cemia enhances ROS production impairing cardiac microen-vironment and regeneration capacity [16, 17].
In particular,several publications showed that the hyperglycemic and oxi- dative microenvironment induces mitochondrial abnormali- ties and cellular damage, eventually leading to senescenceand apoptosis of cardiac progenitors [18, 19]. Thus, to optimize regenerative strategies for diabetic patients, the development of new therapeutic approachesfocused on the reduction of oxidative stress condition isfundamental.Noteworthy, in recent years, L-carnitine (LC) has been proposed as a nutraceutical integrator in the treatment ofnumerous cardiac syndromes, including coronary disease,atherosclerosis, and toxic myocardial injury [20 –22].It is well established that LC, facilitating transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, plays an important role in supporting cardiac energy homeostasis [23 –25].
Most importantly, some studies successfully showed LC ’s ability to reduce oxidative stress, hypoxic cellular damage, and apo-ptosis of cardiac cells in normal glycemic condition [26, 27].In particular, Mao et al. have recently demonstrated thatLC pretreatment ameliorated cellular damage induced byH 2O2in H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes, enhancing mitochon- drial function [28].LC eﬀects on cardiac metabolism and function have been demonstrated under a variety of clinical conditions [29, 30],while LC antioxidative e ﬀects in hyperglycemic cardiomyo- cites were not investigated, yet.The aim of this study is to investigate in vitro LC ability to counteract oxidative stress condition, modifying ROS pro-duction and promoting mitochondrial detoxifying functionin H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes under hyperglycemic condition(25 mmol/L glucose).
The goal is to identify in LC a noveladjuvant agent in cell therapy able to ameliorate the microen-vironment of the hyperglycemic heart, thereby supportingcardiac progenitor cell proliferation and di ﬀerentiation. 2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Chemicals and Reagents.All utilized reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.(St.Louis, MO, USA).Primary antibodies against GAPDH (FL-335), p-CaMKIIα(22B1), CaMKII (M-176), AMPK α1/2 (H-300), SOD2 (FL-222), p21 (C-19), peroxidase-conjugated secondaryantibodies for Western blot analysis, and FITC-conjugatedantibodies for immuno ﬂuorescence study were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).STAT3 (124H6) and p-STAT3 (Ser727) were purchasedfrom Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA).The CellROX® Oxidative Stress Reagent kit (C10443) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Life Technol- ogies Italia (Monza, Italy).2.2.Cell Line and Culture Conditions.
The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) o ﬀered the cardiomyoblast H9c2 cell line of rat embryo. The H9c2 cell line was regularly cultured in Dulbecco ’s modi ﬁed Eagle ’s medium (DMEM, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) contain-ing 25 mmol/L glucose, 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Sigma- Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) in 75 cm 2tissue culture ﬂasks and then incubated at 37°C by adopting 5% CO2.H9c2 cells exposed to high glucose (25 mmol/L) represent a validated in vitro model in order to mimic cardiac hyperglycemic/diabetic condition [31, 32].Cells were fed every day; following literature indications,H9c2 cells were split when reaching 70–80% con ﬂuence in order to prevent the loss of the di ﬀerentiation potential [28, 32].Preliminarily, we evaluated the e ﬀective concentration of LC based on our previous work performed on skeletalmyoblasts and literature evidence (data not shown) [28,33].
We identi ﬁed the correct LC concentrations as the lower concentrations that activated STAT3 signaling. Then, H9c2cells in the active proliferation phase were treated with 0.5or 5 mM LC as indicated in Figure 1.2.3.Growth Curve and Cell Viability Test.H9c2 cells were plated on 60 mm ×15 mm culture dishes at 20% conﬂ uence and grown in DMEM.After an overnight phase, the cells were treated or not with 0.5 or 5 mM LC.At 24, 48, and72 h after treatments, cells were trypsinized and stained withtrypan blue and were counted using hemocytometer.Theaverage values for each single day were used to plot a growth curve.Cell viability was calculated by dividing the unstained viable cell count by the total cell count.In addi-tion, morphological changes were observed daily by phasecontrast microscopy.LC 5 mMLC 0.5 mMCONTR48 h 72 hT0 = 40% confluence Figure 1: Scheme of treatment.
Upon reaching 40% con ﬂuence, H9c2 cells were treated for 48 and 72 h with 0.5 or 5 mM LC.2 Journal of Diabetes Research 2.4. Western Blot Analysis.Western blot analysis was per- formed as described previously [34].Cell lysates were pre- pared using RIPA buﬀ er implemented with protease inhibitors.30 μg of proteins was separated by SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses (SDS-PAGE) and elec-trophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes(Protran®, Whatman® Schleicher & Schuell).The blotswere then blocked and incubated with speci ﬁc primary antibodies, followed by incubation with anti-species- speciﬁc secondary antibodies.To conﬁ rm equal protein loading per sample, we used GAPDH protein as house- keeping protein.Finally, detection of speci ﬁc proteins was performed by enhanced chemoluminescence reagent(Western Lightning ECL Pro, Perkin Elmer).
Quantitative measurement of immunoreactive band intensities was per- formed by densitometric analysis using the Scion Imagesoftware (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA). Datawere then converted into fold changes (FC) of the control.2.5.Immuno ﬂuorescence Studies.H9c2 cells were grown on coverslips with or without LC 0.5 or 5 mM LC.After 48 and 72 h of treatment, cells were washed 3 times withPBS, then ﬁxed in prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes.The cells on the coverslips were washed withPBS and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperaturewith 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100.At that point, H9c2 cells were incubated with pri- mary antibodies for 120 minutes.To detect the primaryantibody, binding site cells were washed three times inPBS and followed by incubation with speci ﬁc antibodies FITC-conjugated for 90 minutes.Nuclei were revealedwith DAPI staining.Coverslips with cells were mountedand observed using Nikon Eclipse 50I microscopy.
Theimages were captured using Nis-Elements D 4.00 software.Immuno ﬂuorescence signals were estimated using the Ima- geJ program (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Data were displayedand analyzed using Adobe Photoshop CS4®.Automated quanti ﬁcation on the immuno ﬂuorescence signal was performed by using the ImageJ program(http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) [34].For each analyzed protein,the quanti ﬁed signal was normalized for the total nuclei number.2.6.Intracellular ROS Determination in H9c2 Cells after H 2O2 Injury.Intracellular ROS levels were valued using the Cell- ROX® Oxidative Stress Reagent kit.Brie ﬂy, H9c2 cells were pretreated with 0.5 or 5 mM LC for 48 h, and then they were exposed to 500 μMH2O2for 30 min.At the end of the H202 injury, the ﬂuorogenic probe of the kit was added (Figure 2(a)).CellROX® Oxidative Stress Reagents areﬂuorogenic probes designed to reliably measure ROS in live cells.
The cell-permeable reagents are non ﬂuorescent or very faintly ﬂuorescent while in a reduced state and during oxida- tion exhibit a strong ﬂuorogenic signal. The CellROX® Orange Reagent signal is localized in the cytoplasm.The images were captured using Nis-Elements D 4.00 software.Data were displayed and analyzed using AdobePhotoshop CS4®.Automated quanti ﬁcation on the immuno ﬂuorescence signal was performed by using the ImageJ program(http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) [35].For each analyzed pro-tein, the quanti ﬁed signal was normalized for the total nuclei number.2.7.Statistical Analysis.All experiments were performed three times.The data are expressed as the means ±standard deviation, and statistical comparisons were performed with speciﬁc statistical packages (Prism v 7.00 GraphPad Soft- ware, San Diego, CA, USA).Di ﬀerences were analyzed by one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followedby Tukey ’s multiple comparison post hoc test.
p<0 05was considered statistically signi ﬁcant. 3.Results 3.1.Attenuation of ROS Production Induced by H2O2in LC Pretreated H9c2 Cells.The diabetic heart usually has ROS levels that exceed normal quantities, and ROS overproduc-tion likely contributes to cardiomyopathy [15, 36, 37].Afterstimulus with 500 μMH 2O2, 48 h pretreatment with 0.5 or 5 mM LC markedly reduced ROS levels with respect to theCONTR condition (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)).Furthermore, DAPI images showed that pretreated H9c2 cells with LC, in particular with 5 mM LC, showed a higher number of nucleithan the control condition (Figures 2(b) and 2(d)): Theseresults suggested that LC pretreatment improved cellular sur-vival after H 2O2injury.3.2.LC Improves Antioxidant Response in H9c2 Cells underHyperglycemic Condition.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation thought phosphorylationon Ser 727is an important protective mechanism to prevent ROS generation in the setting of oxidative stress [38 –40]. Under normoxic conditions, the treatment with 0.5 or5 mM LC for 48 and 72 h signi ﬁcantly enhanced myocardial STAT3 phosphorylation on Ser 727(Figure 3(a)).Moreover, after 48 and 72 h of treatment, exposure of cells to 0.5 mM LC caused rapid increase of SOD2, a well-known antioxidant enzyme [41].This e ﬀect was signi ﬁcantly augmented with the 5 mM LC dose (Figure 3(b)).3.3.LC Downregulation of CaMKII Pathway.Ca 2+/calmodu- lin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, is implicated in the path- ogenesis of cardiac diseases [42, 43] promoting ROS over- production [44, 45].
As shown by immuno ﬂuorescence analysis (Figure 4(a)), compared with untreated H9c2cells, LC treatments decreased CaMKII and pCaMKII-positive cell numbers after 72 h of stimuli: immuno ﬂuores- cence quanti ﬁcation shows a greater e ﬀect with the 5 mM LC dose. Furthermore, after 72 h, either 0.5 or 5 mM dosesof LC signi ﬁcantly decreased the phosphorylation of CaMKII αisoform, as shown by Western blot analysis (Figure 4(b)).3.4.LC Action on AMPK Protein Expression.5′-AMP- activated kinase (AMPK) has become a strategic cellular target for the cure of cardiovascular disease correlated3 Journal of Diabetes Research with DM [46–48]: it is likely that AMPK activity in the diabetic heart may ameliorate cardiac function.After LC stimuli, immuno ﬂuorescence for AMPK showed an increase in AMPK-positive cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 5).3.5.LC Action on Cardiomyocyte Viability.
An uncon- trolled consequence of sustained hyperglycemia is the induction of cardiomyocyte death that causes a loss of contractile units, which declines organ function and pro-vokes hypertrophy of vital cardiomyocytes [49 –51].

To support these data, phase contrastimages, collected at day 3 of the growth curve, con ﬁrmedthe absence of morphological changes in cells treated with0.5 or 5 mM LC respect to control (Figure 6(c)). In opposition to its antiproliferative functions, p21 can also play proproliferative and survival roles when it is local-ized in the cytosol [51].Figure 6(c) shows that the protein con- tent of p21 in cardiomyocytes treated with 0.5 or 5 mM LC was superimposable to control cells, and this result highlightsthat there is not p21 translocation from cytoplasm to nuclei.LC 0.5 mM LC 5 mMCONTR48 h 72 hpSTAT3 GAPDHSTAT3 pSTAT3 GAPDHSTAT3 pSTAT3/STAT3 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0FC 48 h 72 h ⁎⁎⁎⁎⁎⁎§§FCLC 0.5 mM LC 5 mM CONTR (a)48 hSOD2 GAPDH 72 hSOD2 GAPDH⁎⁎0.00.51.01.52.0 48 h 0.00.51.01.52.0 72 hFC FCSOD2 LC 0.5 mM LC 5 mMCONTRLC 0.5 mM LC 5 mM CONTR (b) Figure 3: LC improves antioxidant response in H9c2 cells under hyperglycemic condition.

The association hyperglycemia/ROS/cellular senescence represents a major cause of ine ﬃciency of regenerative medicine [9, 10, 56, 57]. Further, clinical trials establishedthat an altered glycemic control is equal to therapeuticfailure [13, 14].Our data point out that LC could counter- act oxidative stress in the hyperglycemic condition.Those observations are consistent with several previous works thatreported that LC stimuli decrease ROS generation in theskeletal muscle, bone and cardiac cells grown under nor-moglycemic condition [26, 27, 58, 59].Furthermore, asshown in Figure 6, both doses of LC did not modify theH9c2 growth rate and did not induce cellular damages.Studying the mechanism by which LC may modulate ROS formation, we observed an increase in the serine 727(Ser 727) phosphorylation of STAT3, after 48 and 72 hours of treatment (Figure 3(a)).
Recent evidence stresses the criti- cal role of STAT3 in modulating mitochondrial respiratory chain function and ROS production [39, 40]. Serine 727(Ser 727) phosphorylation has a primary part in STAT3inﬂuence on mitochondria: its decrement is associated with the development of cardiac hypertrophy and dilated cardio-myopathy [60].Moreover, several data showed that STAT3conserves complex I activity in ischemic condition enhancingcell viability and plays an important role in heart protectionfrom chronic stress induced by hyperglycemia [61].STAT3activation promotes the expression of SOD2, the principalenzyme e ﬀective in reducing mitochondrial oxidative species [41, 62].LC treatment signi ﬁcantly increased SOD2 expres- sion in in vitro cardiomyocytes, con ﬁrming LC capability to counteract oxidative stress in the hyperglycemic condition(Figure 3(b)).
Interestingly, a number of studies have indicated that CaMKII enhances mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS forma-tion, and apoptosis [63], eventually causing cardiomyocytedeath both following hyperglycemia [64, 65] and oxidativestress conditions [43, 45, 66]. Hyperglycemic cardiac cells are characterized by a vicious circle between ROS/mitochondrial dysfunction/CaMKII that triggers cellular damages and apoptosis phe-nomena [42–44].Taking into consideration that literature evidence, we investigated LC action on CaMKII protein con- tent.As reported in Figure 4, LC treatments reduce CaMKIIactivation.Remarkably, recent experiments hypothesized FC 48 h0.00.51.01.52.0 ⁎⁎⁎§§§FC 72 h0.00.51.01.52.0I.F .AMPK LC 0.5 mM LC 5 mMCONTRLC 0.5 mM LC 0.5 mM LC 5 mM LC 5 mM AMPK 48 h AMPK 72 hCONTR CONTR⁎⁎⁎ Figure 5: LC action on AMPK protein expression.Immuno ﬂuorescence assay and relevant quantiﬁ cation showed an increase in the number of AMPK-positive cells in LC condition at 48 and 72 h.

Data are expressed as fold changes (FC) of mean ±SD.8 Journal of Diabetes Research that CaMKII activation is related to Ca2+movement from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria. Recently, LC was shown to promote Ca2+availability which is needed for proliferation and di ﬀerentiation of human osteoblast-like cells, via a depolarization of L-type calcium channels [59].Despite the Ca2+supply via the L-type channels being essential to ensure appropriate cardiaccell contraction, an excessive Ca 2+inﬂux increases mito- chondrial ROS production in cardiomyocytes under oxida-tive stress.Various authors suggested that cardiac damage,induced by CaMKII activation, is caused by an increase inL-type Ca 2+current [67].LC capability of modulating CaMKII in cardiac cells could make LC a molecule appropriate for impeding thecross-talk between L-type Ca 2+channels and ROS produc- tion and restoring normal mitochondrial function in cardiaccells.
Further investigations are necessary to unravel LCaction on cardiac calcium channels. AMPK represents a strategic target in cardiovascular alterations associated with DM.It is well known that impair-ment of AMPK activation characterizes hyperglycemic car-diomyocytes.In particular, during hypoxia/reoxygenation(H/R) injury in diabetic patients, AMPK de ﬁciency is asso- ciated with an increase in ROS production and apoptosis [46, 47].As shown in Figure 5, LC stimuli enhanced AMPK protein synthesis, suggesting that LC not only could amelio-rate the oxidative microenvironment but also could improvemetabolic functions of cardiac cells.With this in mind,future studies could investigate LC ’s possible action on the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway, implicated indiabetic damage.
As known, in hyperglycemic condition,the decrease in AMPK activity is associated with an increaseof diacylglycerol (DAG) production that activates PKC andNADPH-oxidase causing an abnormal production of ROS[68, 69]. Then, LC ability to stimulate AMPK activationand to regulate the production of acyl-CoA could counter- act hyperinsulinemia-correlated oxidative stress.Whereas the higher risk of developing atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) in diabetic subjects compared to healthy ones is asso- ciated with mitochondrial ROS overproduction, ATP deple-tion, and abnormal calcium homeostasis [70, 71], the keymodulator role shown by LC suggests the potential use of thismicronutrient as adjuvant therapy in di ﬀerent cardiac pathologies associated with DM.In conclusion, LC described e ﬀects could be useful in association with other cardioactive drugs.Ranolazine is anantianginal drug with hypoglycemic action used in AF treat-ment, which was shown to enhance skeletal muscle di ﬀeren- tiation [35].
In cardiac regenerative medicine, antioxidativeLC action, in association with ranolazine, might lead to theimprovement of the hyperglycemic-oxidative microenviron- ment, prevention of apoptosis, and preservation of cell via- bility. Equally interesting could be the synergistic e ﬀect of LC with allopurinol [72] or the α-lipoic acid antioxidant [73] in the prevention and treatment of AF.Remarkabletherapeutic perspectives could arise from the association ofLC with new hypoglycemic drugs, such as incretins, whoseeﬀects on the hyperglycemia control, in ﬂammation, and atherosclerotic plaque progression have recently been dem-onstrated [74, 75].Taken together, our results argue that the use of LC as a coadjuvant in therapeutic treatments is very promising, although extensive studies focused on the determination of the eﬀective LC dose and route of administration in humans should be undertaken.
Anyway, LC doses used in our study(0.5–5 mM) are compatible with ranges used in humans receiving LC therapy [76, 77]. 5.Conclusion The results of this work (Table 1) provide, for the ﬁrst time, fundamental in vitro cellular evidence that treatment with LC could be a potential strategy to improve the cardiac oxida- tive microenvironment caused by hyperglycemia.According to the ﬁndings of the present study, demon- strating the LC ability to decrease production of ROS, acti- vate STAT3 and AMPK, and downregulate CaMKII, LCcould represent a potential adjuvant therapeutic strategy indiabetic cardiac regenerative medicine.This adjuvant therapy might be recommended for dia- betic patients with high risk of cardiac injury as it exerts acardioprotective e ﬀect by restoring the microenvironmen- tal equilibrium by strengthening cardiomyocytes ’defense mechanisms through the stimulation of endogenous anti-oxidants (SOD2).
Further, in vitro andin vivo studies on this topic are essen- tial to improve the knowledge on the e ﬀects of LC in cardiac diseases associated with diabetes and on its potential synergicaction with other antioxidative and hypoglycemic agents.
